The insertion of [[voice acting|voice actor]] performances for [[animation]], such as [[computer generated imagery]] or [[animated cartoon]]s, is often referred to as ADR although it generally does not replace existing dialogue.\n\nThe ADR process may be used to: \n\n:*remove extraneous sounds such as production equipment noise, traffic, wind, or other undesirable sounds from the environment\n:*change the original lines recorded on set to clarify context \n:*improve [[diction]] or modify an [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]\n:*improve [[comic timing|comedic timing]] or dramatic timing\n:*correct technical issues with [[synchronization|synchronisation]]\n:*use a studio-quality singing performance or provide a voice-double for actors who are poor vocalists\n:*add or remove content for legal purposes (such as removing an unauthorised trademarked name)\n:*add or remove a product placement\n:*correct a misspoken line not caught during filming.\n:*replace foul language for TV broadcasts of a movie or other program\nIn conventional film production, a [[production sound mixer]] records dialogue during filming. During post-production, a supervising [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]], or ADR supervisor, reviews all of the dialogue in the film and decides which lines must be re-recorded. ADR is recorded during an ADR session, which takes place in a specialised [[Recording studio|sound studio]]. The actor, usually the original actor from the set, views the scene with the original sound, then attempts to recreate the performance. Over the course of multiple [[take]]s, the actor performs the lines while watching the scene; the most suitable take becomes the final version.<ref>{{cite web |title=ADR |publisher=FilmSound.org |url=http://filmsound.org/terminology/adr.htm |accessdate=6 November 2016}}</ref> The ADR process does not always take place in a post-production studio. The process may be recorded on location, with mobile equipment. ADR can also be recorded without showing the actor the image they must match, but by having them listen to the performance, since some actors{{who|date=June 2019}} believe that watching themselves act can degrade subsequent performances.\n\nSometimes, an actor other than the original actor is used during ADR. One famous example is the ''[[Star Wars]]'' character [[Darth Vader]], portrayed by [[David Prowse]]; in post-production, [[James Earl Jones]] dubbed the voice of Vader.<ref>{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |title=Film: Lucas Returns with 'The Jedi' |date=25 May 1983 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9c00e3d71e38f936a15756c0a965948260 |accessdate=6 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nOther examples include:\n*[[Jean Hagen]] provided [[Debbie Reynolds]]' voice in two scenes of ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952). Ironically, the film's story has Reynolds' character, Kathy Seldon, dubbing the voice for ''Hagen's'' character, Lina Lamont, due to Lina's grating voice and strong New York accent. Hagen used her own normal melodious voice to portray Kathy dubbing for Lina. The film, which takes place in Hollywood as talking pictures are taking over from silent films, also portrays another character, Cosmo Brown, played by [[Donald O'Connor]], as inventing the idea of using one actor to provide the voice for another.\n*[[Marni Nixon]] provided the singing voice for the character [[Eliza Doolittle]], otherwise played by [[Audrey Hepburn]], in the 1964 musical film ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]''. Nixon was also the singing voices for [[Deborah Kerr]] in ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'' and [[Natalie Wood]] in ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'', among many others.\n*[[Ray Park]], who acted as [[Darth Maul]] from ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'' had his voice dubbed over by [[Peter Serafinowicz]]\n*Frenchmen [[Philippe Noiret]] and [[Jacques Perrin]], who were dubbed into Italian for ''[[Cinema Paradiso]]''\n*Austrian bodybuilder [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], dubbed for ''[[Hercules in New York]]''\n*Argentine boxer [[Carlos Monz\u00f3n]], dubbed by a professional actor for the lead in the drama ''[[La Mary]]''\n*[[Gert Frobe]], who played Auric Goldfinger in the James Bond film [[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]], dubbed by Michael Collins\n*[[Andie MacDowell]]'s Jane, in ''[[Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes]]'', who was dubbed by [[Glenn Close]]\n*[[Tom Hardy]], who portrayed [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] in ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'', re-dubbed half of his own lines for ease of viewer comprehension\n*[[Harvey Keitel]] was dubbed by [[Roy Dotrice]] in post production for ''[[Saturn 3]]\n*[[Dave Coulier]] dubbed replacement of swear words for [[Richard Pryor]] in multiple TV versions of his movies\n\n===Process===\nThe tasks involved are performed by three different agents{{clarify|What are agents, and what are the three kinds of agents?|date=June 2019}} in the dubbing process: \n# translation \n# take segmentation \n# insertion of dubbing symbols \n# lip-sync \n# dialogue writing and the emulation of natural discourse\n\nSometimes the translator performs all five tasks. In other cases, the translator just submits a rough translation and a dialogue writer does the rest.\n\n====Dialog writing====\n\nThe dialogue writer\u2019s role is to make the translation sound natural of the target language, and to make the translation sound like a credible dialogue instead of merely a translated text.<ref>Chaume, F. (2013). Research paths in audiovisual translation: The case of dubbing. In The Routledge handbook of translation studies (pp. \n306-320). Routledge.</ref>\n\nAnother task of dialogue writers is to check whether a translation matches an on-screen character\u2019s mouth movements or not, by reading aloud simultaneously with the character. The dialogue writer often stays in the recording setting with the actors or the voice talents, to ensure that the dialogue is being spoken in the way that it was written to be, and to avoid any ambiguity in the way the dialogue is to be read (focusing on emphasis, intonation, pronunciation, articulation, pronouncing foreign words correctly, etc.). The overall goal is to make sure the script creates the illusion of authenticity of the spoken language.\n\n====Rythmo band====\nAn alternative method to dubbing, called \"rythmo band\" (or \"[[Lip sync|lip-sync]] band\"), has historically been used in [[Canada]] and [[France]].{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} It provides a more precise guide{{explain|how is it more precise? What's the difference?|date=June 2019}} for the actors, [[Film director|directors]], and technicians, and can be used to complement the traditional ADR method. The \"band\" is actually a clear 35&nbsp;mm [[film leader]] on which the dialogue is hand-written in [[India ink]], together with numerous additional indications for the actor\u2014including laughs, cries, length of syllables, mouth sounds, breaths, and mouth openings and closings. The rythmo band is projected in the studio and scrolls in perfect synchronisation with the picture.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nStudio time is used more efficiently, since with the aid of scrolling text, picture, and audio cues, actors can read more lines per hour than with ADR alone (only picture and audio). With ADR, actors can average 10\u201312 lines per hour, while rythmo band can facilitate the reading of 35-50 lines per hour.<ref>{{cite web |title=U of U Sound Final |url=http://quizlet.com/8640541/u-of-u-sound-final-flash-cards/ |work=Quizlet |publisher=Quizlet LLC |accessdate=30 July 2012 |author=Quizlet |year=2012}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the preparation of a rythmo band is a time-consuming process involving a series of specialists organised in a production line. This has prevented the technique from being more widely adopted, but software emulations of rythmo band technology overcome the disadvantages of the traditional rythmo band process and significantly reduce the time needed to prepare a dubbing session.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}o\n\n==<span id=\"Practice of dubbing foreign films throughout the world\"></span> Global use==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}\n\n===Dub localization===\nDub localization, also often simply referred to as [[Language localization|localization]], is the practice of [[voice-over translation]] that alters a [[film]] or [[television series]] from one region of the world to the local language of another.\n\nThe new voice track is usually spoken by a [[voice actor]]. In many countries, actors who regularly perform this duty remain little-known, with the exception of particular circles (such as anime [[fandom]]) or when their voices have become synonymous with roles or actors whose voices they usually dub. In the United States, many of these voice artists may employ pseudonyms or go uncredited due to [[Screen Actors Guild]] regulations or the desire to dissociate themselves from the role.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nDub localisation is a contentious issue in [[cinephilia]] amongst aficionados of foreign [[filmmaking]] and [[television program]]s, particularly [[anime]] fans. While some localisation is virtually inevitable in translation, the controversy surrounding how much localisation is \"too much\" is often discussed in such communities, especially when the final dub product is significantly different from the original. Some fans frown on any extensive localisation, while others expect it, and to varying degrees, appreciate it.\n\n===Europe===\n[[File:Dubbing films in Europe.png|thumb|300px|{{legend|#0000FF|Dubbing only for children: Otherwise solely subtitles.}}\n{{legend|#FF0000|General dubbing: Countries using a full-cast dubbing.}}\n{{legend|#FFFF00|Voice-over: Countries using a couple or just one voice actor, whereas the original soundtrack persists.

For movies in cinemas with clear target audiences (both below and above 10\u201311 years of age), both a dubbed and a subtitled version are usually available.\n\n=====Albania=====\nThe first movie dubbed in [[Albanian language]] was ''[[The Great Warrior Skanderbeg]]'' in 1954 and since then, there have been thousands of popular titles dubbed in Albanian by different dubbing studios. All animated movies and children's programs are dubbed into Albanian language, many live-action movies as well. TV series nevertheless are usually not dubbed, they are subtitled except for a few [[Mexico|Mexican]], [[Brazil]]ian and [[Turkey|Turkish]] soap operas, like: ''[[Por ti (telenovela)|Por Ti]]'', ''[[Celebridade]]'', ''[[A Casa das Sete Mulheres]]'', ''[[Parampar\u00e7a (TV series)|Parampar\u00e7a]]'', etc. As for documentaries, Albania usually uses voice-over.\n\n=====Belgium=====\nIn the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium ([[Flanders]]), movies and TV series are shown in their original language with [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], with the exception of most movies made for a young audience. In the latter case, sometimes separate versions are recorded in the [[Netherlands]] and in [[Flanders]] (for instance, several [[List of Disney theatrical animated features|Walt Disney films]] and [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]]). These dubbed versions only differ from each other in their use of different voice actors and different pronunciation, while the text is almost the same.\n\nIn the French-speaking part of Belgium ([[Wallonia]]), the range of French-dubbed versions is approximately as wide as the [[German language|German]] range, where nearly all movies and TV series are dubbed.\n\n=====Bosnia and Herzegovina=====\n[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] usually uses [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] dubs, but they have dubbed some cartoons in [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] by themselves, for example ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]''. Children's programs (both animated and live-action) are airing dubbed (in Serbian, Croatian or Bosnian), while every other program is subtitled (in Bosnian).\n\n=====Croatia=====\nIn [[Croatia]], foreign films and TV series are always subtitled, while most children's programs and animated movies are dubbed into [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. The practice of dubbing began in the 1980s in some animated shows and continued in 90's, 00's and forward in other shows and films, the latter ones being released in home media. Recently, more efforts have been made to introduce dubbing, but public reception has been poor in some exceptions. Regardless of language, Croatian audiences prefer subtitling to dubbing, however it is still popular in animated films. Some previously popular shows (such as ''[[Sailor Moon]]'') lost their appeal completely after the practice of dubbing began, and the dubbing was eventually removed from the programs, even though most animated shows shown on television and some on home media have been well received by people watching dubbed versions of them. This situation is similar with theater movies, with only those intended for children being dubbed (such as ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' and ''[[Shark Tale]]''), but nowadays are shown in dubbed versions. Also, there has been an effort to impose dubbing by [[Nova TV (Croatia)|Nova TV]], with ''[[La Fea M\u00e1s Bella]]'' translated as ''Ru\u017ena ljepotica'' (literally, \"The Ugly Beauty\"), a Mexican telenovela, but it failed. Some of [[Croatian language|Croatian]] dubbing is also broadcast in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].\n\n=====Estonia=====\nIn [[Estonia]] in cinemas, only children's animated films are dubbed and live-action films are shown in the original English and Russian languages with subtitles at cinemas. Subtitles are usually presented in both Estonian and [[Russian language]]s. Cartoons and animated series voiced by dubbing or [[Voice-over|voiceover]] and live-action films and television series only with Estonian subtitles also but with English and Russian Dub Languages. Animated films are commonly shown in both the originals and Russian languages and dubbed into Estonian (or Russian in many cinemas). Most Estonian-language television channels use subtitles English and Russian Audio for foreign-language films and TV channels. However, Russian language channels tend to use dubbing more often, especially for Russian channels broadcast from [[Russia]] (as opposed to Russian channels broadcast from Estonia).\n\n=====Greece=====\nIn [[Greece]], most cartoon films have dubs. Usually when a movie has a Greek dub the dub is shown in cinemas but subtitled versions are shown as well. Foreign TV shows for adults are shown in their original versions with subtitles, most cartoons, for example, ''[[The Flintstones]]'' and ''[[The Jetsons]]'' were always dubbed, while ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[American Dad!]]'' are always subtitled and contain the original English dialogue, since they are mostly for adults rather than children, (even though the movie ''[[Space Jam]]'' was subtitled instead of being dubbed, since also this is suitable for children). Also some Japanese anime series are dubbed in Greek (such as Pok\u00e9mon, Pichi Pichi Pitch, Sailor Moon etc.) The only television programs dubbed in Greek includes [[Mexico|Mexican]] TV series (like ''[[Rub\u00ed (2004 telenovela)|Rub\u00ed]]'' and ''[[La usurpadora (Mexican TV series)|La usurpadora]]'') and teen series (like ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' and ''[[The Suite Life of Zack & Cody]]''). However, when [[Skai TV]] was re-launched in April 2006, the network opted for dubbing almost all foreign shows in Greek, unlike other Greek channels which had always broadcast most of the programs in their original language with subtitles.\n\n=====Ireland=====\nIreland usually receives the same film versions as the UK. However some films have been dubbed into [[Irish language|Irish]] by [[TG4]], including the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=bY4JK5PR4MAC&lpg=PA275&ots=D6dkX7Up-y&dq=Harry%20Potter%20TG4&pg=PA275#v=onepage&q&f=true ''Writing and Translating for Children''], Elena Di Giovanni, Chiara Elefante, Roberta Pederzoli, Peter Lang, 2010, page 259</ref>\n\n=====Netherlands=====\nIn the [[Netherlands]], for the most part, Dutch versions are only made for children's and family films. Animated movies are shown in theaters with Dutch dubbing, but usually those cinemas with more screening rooms also provide the original subtitled version, such as movies like ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' and ''[[WALL-E]]''.\n\n=====North Macedonia=====\n[[North Macedonia]] dubbed many cartoons in [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], but they also air some [[Serbian language|Serbian]] dubs. Children's programs are airing dubbed (in Macedonian or Serbian), while every other program is subtitled (in Macedonian). They use [[Serbian language|Serbian]] dubs for [[Disney]] movies, because there are no [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] [[Disney]] dubs.\n\n=====Poland=====\n{{essay|section|date=October 2016}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nIn [[Poland]], cinema releases for general audiences are almost exclusively subtitled, with the exception of children's movies, and television screenings of movies, as well as made-for-TV shows. These are usually shown with voice-over, where a voice talent reads a translation over the original soundtrack. This method, called \"juxtareading,\" is similar to the so-called [[Gavrilov translation]] in Russia, with one difference\u2014all dialogues are voiced by one off-screen reader ({{lang-pl|lektor}}), preferably with a deep and neutral voice which does not interfere with the pitch of voice of the original speakers in the background. To some extent, it resembles live translation. Certain highly qualified voice talents are traditionally assigned to particular kinds of production, such as action or drama. Standard dubbing is not widely popular with most audiences, with the exception of cartoons and children's shows, which are dubbed also for TV releases.\n\nIt is claimed that, until around 1951, there were no revoiced foreign movies available in Poland. Instead, they were exclusively subtitled in Polish.<ref>{{cite book|title=Das kulturelle Leben der Deutschen in Niederschlesien unter polnischer Verwaltung. 1947-1958|first=Bernhard|last=Grund|publisher=Bundesministerium f\u00fcr gesamtdeutsche Fragen|place=Bonn und Berlin|date=1967|series=Bonner Berichte aus Mittel- und Ostdeutschland|page=119}}</ref>\n\nPoland's dubbing traditions began between the two world wars. In 1931, among the first movies dubbed into Polish were ''[[Dangerous Curves (1929 film)|Dangerous Curves]]'' (1929), ''[[The Dance of Life]]'' (1929), ''[[Paramount on Parade]]'' (1930), and ''[[Darling of the Gods]]'' (1930). In 1949, the first dubbing studio opened in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]. The first film dubbed that year was ''Russkiy Vopros'' (filmed 1948).\n\nPolish dubbing in the first post-war years suffered from poor synchronisation. Polish dialogues were not always audible and the cinema equipment of that time often made films sound less clear than they were. In the 1950s, Polish publicists discussed the quality of Polish versions of foreign movies.\n\nThe number of dubbed movies and the quality improved. Polish dubbing had a golden age between the 1960s and the 1980s. Approximately a third of foreign movies screened in cinemas were dubbed. The \"Polish dubbing school\" was known for its high quality. In that time, Poland had some of the best dubbing in the world. The person who initiated high-quality dubbing versions was director Zofia Dybowska-Aleksandrowicz. In that time, dubbing in Poland was very popular. Polish television dubbed popular films and TV series such as ''[[Rich Man, Poor Man (miniseries)|Rich Man, Poor Man]]''; ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', ''[[Forsyte Saga]]'', ''[[Elizabeth R]]'', ''[[I, Claudius]]'', ''[[I'll Take Manhattan (miniseries)|I'll Take Manhattan]]'', and ''[[Peter the Great (TV series)|Peter the Great]]''.\n\nIn the 1980s, due to budget cuts, state-run TV saved on tapes by voicing films over live during transmission.\n\nOverall, during 1948\u20131998, almost 1,000 films were dubbed in Polish. In the 1990s, dubbing films and TV series continued, although often also for one emission only.\n\nIn 1995, [[Canal+]] was launched in Poland. In its first years, it dubbed 30% of its schedule dubbing popular films and TV series, one of the best-known and popular dubbings was that of ''[[Friends (TV series)|Friends]]'', but this proved unsuccessful.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20151222233455/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119215016517556740 On Polish TV, Desperate Wives Sound Like Guys], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', 12 October 2007</ref> It stopped dubbing films in 1999, although many people supported the idea of dubbing and bought the access only for dubbing versions of foreign productions. In the 1990s, dubbing was done by the television channel known as [[Wizja Jeden]]. They mainly dubbed [[BBC]] productions such as ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]'', ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'' and ''[[Men Behaving Badly]]''. Wizja Jeden was closed in 2001. In the same year, TVP stopped dubbing the TV series ''[[Frasier]]'', although that dubbing was very popular.\n\nCurrently, dubbing of films and TV series for teenagers is made by Nickelodeon and Disney Channel. One of the major breakthroughs in dubbing was the Polish release of ''Shrek'', which contained many references to local culture and Polish humour. Since then, people seem to have grown to like dubbed versions more, and pay more attention to the dubbing actors.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} However, this seems to be the case only with animated films, as live-action dubbing is still considered a bad practice. In the case of [[DVD|DVD releases]], most discs contain both the original soundtrack and subtitles, and either voice over or dubbed Polish track. The dubbed version is, in most cases, the one from the theater release, while voice-over is provided for movies that were only subtitled in theaters.\n\nSince theatrical release of ''The Avengers'' in May 2012, Walt Disney Company Polska dubs all films for cinema releases. Also in 2012, [[United International Pictures]] Polska dubbed ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', while Forum Film Polska \u2013 former distributor of Disney's films \u2013 decided to dub ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'', along with its [[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug|two]] [[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|sequels]]. However, when a dub is produced but the film's target audience is not exclusively children, both dubbed and subtitled versions are usually available in movie theaters. The dubbed versions are more commonly shown in morning and early afternoon hours, with the subtitled version dominating in the evening. Both can be available in parallel at similar hours in multiplexes.\n\n=====Portugal=====\nIn [[Portugal]], dubbing was banned under a 1948 law as a way of protecting the domestic film industry and reduce the access to culture as most of the population was illiterate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amordeperdicao.pt/especiais_solo.asp?artigoid=206 |title=amor de perdi\u00e7\u00e3o - especiais |date=21 January 2005 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050121055806/http://www.amordeperdicao.pt/especiais_solo.asp?artigoid=206 |archivedate=21 January 2005  }}</ref> Until 1994, animated movies, as well as other TV series for children shown in Portugal, have imported [[Brazilian Portuguese]] dubs due to the lack of interest from Portuguese companies in the dubbing industry. This lack of interest was justified, since there were already quality dubbed copies of shows and movies in Portuguese made by [[Brazil]]ians. ''[[The Lion King]]'' was the first feature film to be dubbed in [[European Portuguese]] rather than strictly Brazilian Portuguese. Currently, all movies for children are dubbed in European Portuguese. Subtitles are preferred in Portugal,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jornaleconomico.sapo.pt/noticias/polemica-dobragem-serie-einstein-gera-criticas-axn-118969|title=Pol\u00e9mica: dobragem da s\u00e9rie 'Einstein' gera cr\u00edticas ao AXN|access-date=29 March 2017|date=3 February 2017|work=O Jornal Econ\u00f3mico|quote=Ao contr\u00e1rio de alguns mercados como o espanhol e brasileiro, o p\u00fablico portugu\u00eas n\u00e3o se mostra recetivo a esta op\u00e7\u00e3o.|language=portuguese}}</ref> used in every foreign-language [[Documentary film|documentary]], TV series and film. The exception to this preference is when children are the target audience.\n\nWhile on TV, children's shows and movies are always dubbed, in cinemas, films with a clear juvenile target can be found in two versions, one dubbed (identified by the letters V.P. for ''vers\u00e3o portuguesa'' - \"Portuguese version\") and another subtitled version (V.O. for ''vers\u00e3o original'' - \"original version\"). This duality applies only to juvenile films. Others use subtitles only. While the quality of these dubs is recognised (some have already received international recognition and prizes), original versions with subtitles are usually preferred by the adults (''[[Bee Movie]]'', for example). Dubbing cartoons aimed at adults (such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'' or ''[[South Park]]'') is less common. When ''The Simpsons Movie'' debuted in Portugal, most cinemas showed both versions (V.O. and V.P.), but in some small cities, cinemas decided to offer only the Portuguese version, a decision that led to public protest. Presently, [[live action]] series and movies are always shown in their original language format with Portuguese subtitles. Television programs for young children (such as ''[[Power Rangers]]'', ''[[Goosebumps (TV series)|Goosebumps]]'', ''[[Big Bad Beetleborgs]]'', etc.) are dubbed into European Portuguese. Some video games aimed at adults (such as [[God of War III]], [[Halo 3]], [[Assassin's Creed III]] and [[inFamous 2]]) are dubbed in European Portuguese, although there they provide an option to select the original language.\n\n=====Romania=====\n<!-- Please do not change this section to Hungarian, because graph QA11 of the Eurobarometer lists the number 62 next to RO (Romania). Hungary is HU.-->\nIn [[Romania]], virtually all programmes intended for children are dubbed in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], including cartoons, live-action movies and TV series on [[Disney Channel Romania|Disney Channel]], [[Cartoon Network (Europe)|Cartoon Network]], [[Minimax tv|Minimax]], and [[Nickelodeon]], as well as those shown on general television networks, children-focused series (such as ''[[Power Rangers]]'', ''[[Goosebumps (TV series)|Goosebumps]]'', ''[[The New Addams Family]]'', ''[[The Planet's Funniest Animals]]'') or movies screened on children's television. Animated movies are shown in theaters with Romanian dubbing. However, those cinemas with more screening rooms usually also provide the original subtitled version. Such was the case for movies like ''[[Babe (movie)|Babe]]'', ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Cars (movie)|Cars]]'', ''[[Shrek the Third]]'', ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'', ''[[Kung Fu Panda]]'' and ''[[WALL-E]]''. Other foreign TV shows and movies are shown in the original language with Romanian subtitles. Subtitles are usually preferred in the Romanian market. According to \"Special Eurobarometer 243\" (graph QA11.8) of the [[European Commission]] (research carried out in November and December 2005), 62% of Romanians prefer to watch foreign films and programmes with subtitles (rather than dubbed), 22% prefer dubbing, and 16% declined to answer.<ref name=\"eurobarometer\">[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf Special Eurobarometer 243] of the European Commission with the title \"Europeans and their Languages\", published in February 2006 with research carried out in November and December 2005. Barely 2% of Romanians consider watching original-language versions most effective into learning a new language (Table QA7b).</ref> This is led by the assumption that watching movies in their original versions is very useful for learning foreign languages. However, according to the same Eurobarometer, virtually no Romanian found this method\u2014watching movies in their original version\u2014to be the most efficient way to learn foreign languages, compared to 53 percent who preferred language lessons at school.<ref name=\"eurobarometer\" />\n\nIn Romania, foreign language television programs and films are generally subtitled rather than dubbed.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=csMetRFKXmgC&lpg=PT61&dq=romania%20dubbing%20tv&pg=PT61#v=onepage&q=romania%20dubbing%20tv&f=true ''Dracula is Dead: How Romanians Survived Communism, Ended It, and Emerged Since 1989 as the New Italy''], Sheilah Kast, Jim Rosapepe, 2009, page 49</ref> This includes programs in non-Western languages, such as [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Korean language|Korean]] or [[Hindi language|Hindi]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=aXutBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA91&dq=romania+subtitles+television&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiI-s2aysvOAhXrAMAKHXs4Ca4Q6AEIPDAF#v=onepage&q=romania%20subtitles%20television&f=true ''The Global Impact of South Korean Popular Culture: Hallyu Unbound''], Valentina Marinescu, Lexington Books, 2014, page 91</ref>\n\n=====Serbia=====\n[[Serbian language]] dubs are made mainly for [[Serbia]], but they broadcast in [[Montenegro]] and [[Bosnia & Herzegovina]], too. Children's animated and some live-action movies and TV series are dubbed into Serbian, while live-action films and TV series for adults are always airing subtitled, because in this region people prefer subtitling for live-action formats. [[Turkey|Turkish]] soap opera ''[[Lale Devri]]'' started airing dubbed in 2011, on [[RTV Pink]], but because of bad reception, dub failed and rest of TV series was aired subtitled. ''[[Married... with Children]]'' was dubbed, too.\n\nThe dubbing of cartoon series in former [[Yugoslavia]] during the 1980s had a twist of its own: famous [[Serbia]]n actors, such as [[Nikola Simi\u0107 (actor)|Nikola Simi\u0107]], [[Mi\u0107a Tati\u0107]], [[Nada Blam]] and others provided the voices for characters of [[Disney]], [[Warner Bros.]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] and other companies, frequently using region-specific phrases and sentences and, thus, adding a dose of local humor to the translation of the original lines. These phrases became immensely popular and are still being used for [[tongue-in-cheek]] comments in specific situations. These dubs are today considered cult dubs. The only dub made after 1980s and 1990s ones that's considered cult is ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' dub, made by [[B92]] in period 2002\u20132017, because of a great popularity and memorable translation with local humor phrases, such as 1980s dubs translation.\n\nSome Serbian dubs are also broadcast in [[North Macedonia]], while cult dubs made during [[Yugoslavia]] were aired all over the country (today's [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]], [[Slovenia]], [[North Macedonia]] and [[Serbia]]).\n\n=====Slovenia=====\nIn [[Slovenia]], all foreign films and television programs are subtitled with the exception of children's movies and TV shows (both animated or live-action). While dubbed versions are always shown in cinemas and later on TV channels, cinemas will sometimes play subtitled versions of children's movies as well.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n=====United Kingdom=====\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the vast majority of foreign language films are subtitled, although mostly animated films are dubbed in English.  These usually originate from [[North America]], as opposed to being dubbed locally. Foreign language serials shown on BBC Four are subtitled into English (although open subtitles are dropped during dialogues with English language segments already).  There have, however, been notable examples of films and TV programmes successfully dubbed in the UK, such as the Japanese ''[[Monkey (TV series)|Monkey]]'' and French ''[[The Magic Roundabout|Magic Roundabout]]'' series.  When airing films on television, channels in the UK often choose subtitling over dubbing, even if a dubbing in English exists. It is also a fairly common practice for animation aimed at [[Preschool education|preschool]] children to be re-dubbed with British voice actors replacing the original voices, such as Spin Master Entertainment's [[PAW Patrol|Paw Patrol]] series, although this is not done with shows aimed at older audiences.  The off-screen narrated portions of some programmes and reality shows that originate from North America are also redone with British English voices.  \n\nSome animated films and TV programmes are also dubbed into [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]].\n\n[[Hinterland (TV series)|Hinterland]] displays a not so common example of a bilingual production. Each scene is filmed twice, in the English and Welsh languages, apart from a few scenes where Welsh with subtitles is used for the English version.<ref>{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jul/30/hinterland-tv-noir-wales |title=Hinterland \u2013 the TV noir so good they made it twice |first=Stephen |last=Moss |date=30 July 2013 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=[[London]] |access-date=5 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n=====Nordic countries=====\nIn the [[Nordic countries]], dubbing is used only in animated features (except [[adult animated]] features) and other films for younger audiences. Some cinemas in the major cities may also screen the original version, usually as the last showing of the day, or in a smaller auditorium in a [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]].\n\nIn television programs with off-screen narration, both the original audio and on-screen voices are usually subtitled in their native languages.\n\nThe Nordic countries are often treated as a common market issuing [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] releases with original audio and user choosable subtitle options in [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. The covers often have text in all four languages as well, but are sometimes unique for each country. Some releases may include other European language audio and/or subtitles (i.e. German, Greek, Hungarian or Italian). Children's films typically have Nordic audio tracks in all four languages, as well as original audio in most cases.\n\nIn [[Finland]], the dubbed version from [[Sweden]] may also be available at certain cinemas for children of the 5% Swedish-speaking minority, but only in cities or towns with a significant percentage of Swedish speakers. Most [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] releases usually only have the original audio, except for children's films, which have both Finnish and Swedish language tracks, in addition to the original audio and subtitles in both languages.\n\nIn Finnish movie theaters, films for adult audiences have both Finnish and Swedish subtitles, the Finnish printed in basic font and the Swedish printed below the Finnish in a cursive font. In the early ages of television, foreign TV shows and movies were voiced by narrator in Finland. Later, subtitles became a practice on Finnish television. Dubbing of films other than children's films is unpopular in Finland, as in many other countries. A good example is ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''. While the original version was well-received, the Finnish-dubbed version received poor reviews, with some critics even calling it a disaster.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} On the other hand, many dubs of [[Disney]] animated features have been well-received, both critically and by the public.\n\nIn [[Iceland]], the dubbed version of film and TV is usually [[Danish language|Danish]] with some translated into [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]. [[LazyTown]], an Icelandic TV show originally broadcast in English, was dubbed into Icelandic, amongst thirty-two other languages, and it remains the TV show to have been dubbed into the most languages.\n\n====General films and programming====\nIn the [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[German language|German]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] language-speaking markets of [[Europe]], almost all foreign films and television shows are dubbed (the exception being the majority of theatrical releases of adult-audience movies in the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Poland]] and [[Turkey]] and high-profile videos in Russia). There are few opportunities to watch foreign movies in their original versions. In [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]] and [[Austria]], even in the largest cities, there are few cinemas that screen original versions with [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], or without any translation. However, digital [[pay-TV]] programming is often available in the original language, including the latest movies. Prior to the rise of DVDs, which in these countries are mostly issued with multi-language audio tracks, original-language films (those in languages other than the country's official language) were rare, whether in theaters, on TV, or on home video, and subtitled versions were considered a product for small [[niche market]]s such as intellectual or [[art film]]s.\n\n\n\n\n=====France=====\nIn [[France]], movies and TV series are, except purely arthouse films, usually released in the dubbed French-language version. The original-language version of the film with French subtitles is released in designated theaters which show only subtitled versions or both versions are shown at different times or split screenings between both versions. However, dubbing is the norm and subtitling is only for niche audience and movies with subtitles are usually very small arthouse films with very limited commercial prospects for pay and free TV airings and also home entertainment (VOD, DVD). Dubbing in the French Language is thus absolutely essential for any sale to be made.\n\nSince the digitalization of over-the-air television broadcasters, both versions have been offered to the customer simultaneously.  By default, foreign films and TV programmes shown on television are dubbed into French on a channel's main audio feed. However, with the advent of digital television, viewers can access the original language feed for some programmes, as well as matching subtitles.  In addition, the TV network ARTE has a French-language track on its main audio feed as well as a German-language track.  \n \nMost movies are released nationwide in dubbed version and subtitled versions where available with the exception of very limited often micro-budget arthouse productions that do stem come from the \"hollywood movie production\" machine which are exclusively arthouse films and not dubbed at the time of their theatrical release.\n\nTheaters showing these kind of movies or also showing commercial films in the original-language version with French subtitles are very rare outside of the big cities and most of them are located in [[Paris]] which has the most \"cinephile\" cinemas in France. Often these \"niche\" films are only released in [[Paris]] region.\n\nA theater showing subtitled versions of original language movies are typically well known for this and will advertise this also on the poster advising moviegoers that the film is shown in an original-language version (usually abbreviated VO [''version originale''] or VOST [''version originale sous-titr\u00e9e'']), as opposed to VF [''version fran\u00e7aise''], the latter then becoming what is known and used also in the neighboring countries like Belgium or Switzerland, as the \"FRENCH LANGUAGE VERSION\" of the film.)\n\nBecause the alterations made to the original film are so profound, making it no longer viewable or understandable for audiences that speak the language the film was originally shot in, the final dubbed version is called the \"French-language version\", as opposed to the use of subtitles which leave the film in its original state.\nThe choice to dub or not at the time of theatrical release is a decision made by the distributor releasing the film based upon their recoupment strategy for the film and their prognosis of the commercial prospects. Given the fact that a dub is needed for home entertainment and TV sales, only very small arthouse films are never dubbed.\nOnly a very small percentage (according to the official institute CNC in France only 16.4% of all ticket-sales were for movies watched in the original-language version with subtitles) and this is counting Blockbusters and others shown in their original-language version with subtitles and the small number of films that are never dubbed.\nVoice actors that have dubbed for celebrities in the European French language can be viewed here.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

In [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's]] fascist Italy, release of movies in foreign languages was banned for political reasons. Rome is the principal base of the dubbing industry, where major productions such as movies, drama, documentaries and some cartoons are dubbed. However, dubbing in Milan is mostly of cartoons and some minor productions. Practically every foreign film (mostly American ones) of every genre, for children or adults, as well as TV shows, are dubbed into Italian. In big cities, original-version movies can also be seen in some theaters but it is not so common. Subtitles may be available on [[Late night television|late-night programs]] on mainstream TV channels, and on pay-TV all movies are available in the original language with Italian subtitles, many shows featuring their original [[soundtrack]]s.\n\nEarly in their careers, actors such as [[Alberto Sordi]] or [[Nino Manfredi]] worked extensively as dubbing actors. At one point, common practice in Italian cinema was to shoot scenes [[MOS (filmmaking)|MOS]] (motor only sync or motor only shot) and dub the dialogue in post-production. A notable example of this practice is ''[[The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly]]'', in which all actors had to dub in their own voices.\n\nVideo games are generally either dubbed into Italian (for instance [[Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed]] saga, [[Halo (series)|Halo]] or [[Harry Potter (video games)|Harry Potter]] series etc.) or released with original-speaking tracks but with all the texts translated into Italian language.\n\nA list of the voice actors that have dubbed for celebrities in Italian can be enlisted here.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Some dubbing actors have achieved popularity for their voices, such as [[Constantino Romero]] (who dubs [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Darth Vader]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]'s [[The Terminator|Terminator]], among others) and [[\u00d3scar Mu\u00f1oz (filmmaking)|\u00d3scar Mu\u00f1oz]] (the official European Spanish dub-over voice artist for [[Elijah Wood]] and [[Hayden Christensen]]). Currently, with the spread of [[digital terrestrial television]], viewers can choose between the original and the dubbed soundtracks for most movies and television.\n\nIn some communities such as [[Catalonia]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], some foreign programs are also dubbed into their own languages, different from European Spanish. Films from \nthe Spanish-speaking America shown in these communities are shown in their original language, while strong regional accents (from the Spanish-speaking America or from Spain) may be subtitled in news and documentaries.\n\n=====Germany, Austria and Switzerland=====\nThe [[German language|Germanophone]] dubbing market is the largest in Europe. Germany has the most foreign-movie-dubbing studios per capita and per given area in the world and according to the German newspaper [[Die Welt]] 52% of all voice actors currently work in the German dubbing industry. In Germany, Austria, and the German-speaking part of [[Switzerland]], practically all films, shows, television series and foreign [[soap opera]]s are shown in dubbed versions created for the German market. However, in some of Switzerland's towns and cities (particularly along the language-borders), subtitled versions are common. Dubbing films is a traditional and common practice in German-speaking Europe, since subtitles are not accepted and used as much as in other European countries. According to a European study, Austria is the country with the highest rejection rate (more than 70 percent) of subtitles, followed by Italy, Spain and Germany.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\nIn German-speaking markets, [[PC game|computer]] and video games feature German text menus and are dubbed into the German language if speaking parts exist.\n\nIn recent years, Swiss and Austrian television stations have been showing increasing numbers of movies, series and TV-programmes in \"dual sound,\" which means the viewer can choose between the original language (e.g. English) and the language of the channel (German, French or Italian, according to the location).\n\nAlthough German-speaking [[voice actor]]s play only a secondary role, they are still notable for providing familiar voices to well-known actors. Famous foreign actors are known and recognised for their [[German language|German]] voice, and the German audience is used to them, so dubbing is also a matter of authenticity. However, in larger cities, there are theaters where movies can be seen in their original versions, as [[English language|English]] has become somewhat more popular among young educated viewers. On German [[mainstream]] television, films are never broadcast with subtitles, but pay-per-view programming is often available in the original language. Subtitled niche and [[art film]]s are sometimes aired on smaller networks.\n\nGerman-dubbed versions sometimes diverge greatly from the original, especially in adding humorous elements absent from the original. In extreme cases, such as ''[[The Persuaders!]]'', the German-dubbed version was more successful than the English original. Often, translation adds [[sexually explicit]] gags the U.S. versions might not be allowed to use. For example, in ''[[Bewitched (2005 film)|Bewitched]]'', the translators changed ''\"The [[Door hanger|Do Not Disturb sign]] will hang on the door tonight\"'' to ''\"The only hanging thing tonight will be the Do Not Disturb sign\"''.\n\nSome movies dubbed in Austria diverge from the German Standard version in addressing other people but only when the movies are dubbed into certain Austrian dialect versions. (Mr. and Mrs. are translated into Herr and Frau which is usually not translated in order to be in lip-sync).\nSometimes even English pronounced first names are translated and are pronounced into the correct German equivalent (English name \"Bert\" became Southern German pronounced name \"Bertl\" which is an abbreviation for any name either beginning or even ending with \"bert\", e.g. \"Berthold\" or \"Albert\".)\n\nSome movies dubbed before [[German reunification|reunification]] exist in different versions for the [[East Germany|east]] and the [[West Germany|west]]. They use different translations, and often differ in the style of dubbing.\n\nSome of the well-known German dubbing voice artists are listed below.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Czech dubbing was also extensively used in the broadcast of Slovak television channels, but since 2008 Slovak language laws require any newer shows (understood as the first television broadcast in Slovakia) to be provided with Slovak localisation (dubbing or subtitles); since then, television broadcasts of films, TV series and cartoons have been dubbed into Slovak.\n\n=====Hungary=====\n<!-- Please do not change this section to Romanian because the sources in this section are directly related to Hungary.-->\nIn [[Hungary]], dubbing is almost universally common. Almost every foreign movie or TV show released in Hungary is dubbed into Hungarian.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://matadornetwork.com/abroad/9-culture-shocks-americans-will-hungary/ |title=9 culture shocks Americans will have in Hungary}}</ref> The history of dubbing dates back to the 1950s, when the country was still under communist rule.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.masterfilm.hu/services |title=Masterfilm :: Services}}</ref> One of the most iconic Hungarian dubs was of the American cartoon ''[[The Flintstones]]'', with a local translation by [[J\u00f3zsef Romh\u00e1nyi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sherlockian-sherlock.com/the-dubbed-versions-of-sherlock-holmes.php |title=Dubbed versions Sherlock Holmes, dubbing, hungarian voices}}</ref> The Internetes Szinkron Adatb\u00e1zis (ISzDB) is the largest Hungarian database for film dubs, with information for many live action and animated films.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iszdb.hu |title=ISzDb - Internetes Szinkron Adatb\u00e1zis}}</ref> On page 59 of the Eurobarometer, 84% of Hungarians said that they prefer dubbing over subtitles.<ref name=\"eurobarometer\" />\n\nIn the [[Socialism|socialist]] era, every film was dubbed with professional and mostly popular actors. Care was taken to make sure the same voice actor would lend his voice to the same original actor. In the early 1990s, as cinemas tried to keep up with showing newly released films, subtitling became dominant in the cinema. This, in turn, forced TV channels to make their own cheap versions of dubbed soundtracks for the movies they presented, resulting in a constant degrading of dubbing quality. Once this became customary, cinema distributors resumed the habit of dubbing for popular productions, presenting them in a below-average quality. However, every feature is presented with the original soundtrack in at least one cinema in large towns and cities.\n\nHowever, in Hungary, most documentary films and series (for example, those on [[Discovery Channel]], [[National Geographic Channel]]) are made with [[Voice-over|voiceovers]]. Some old movies and series, or ones that provide non-translatable jokes and conversations (for example, the ''[[Mr. Bean]]'' television series), are shown only with subtitles.\n\nThere is a more recent problem arising from dubbing included on DVD releases. Many generations have grown up with an original (and, by current technological standards, outdated) soundtrack, which is either technologically (mono or bad quality stereo sound) or legally (expired soundtrack license) unsuitable for a DVD release. Many original features are released on DVD with a new soundtrack, which in some cases proves to be extremely unpopular, thus forcing DVD producers to include the original soundtrack. In some rare cases, the Hungarian soundtrack is left out altogether. This happens notably with Warner Home Video Hungary, which ignored the existence of Hungarian soundtracks completely, as they did not want to pay the licenses for the soundtracks to be included on their new DVD releases, which appear with improved picture quality, but very poor subtitling.\n\n=====Poland=====\n{{essay|section|date=October 2016}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nIn [[Poland]], cinema releases for general audiences are almost exclusively subtitled, with the exception of children's movies, and television screenings of movies, as well as made-for-TV shows. These are usually shown with voice-over, where a voice talent reads a translation over the original soundtrack. This method, called \"juxtareading,\" is similar to the so-called [[Gavrilov translation]] in Russia, with one difference\u2014all dialogues are voiced by one off-screen reader ({{lang-pl|lektor}}), preferably with a deep and neutral voice which does not interfere with the pitch of voice of the original speakers in the background. To some extent, it resembles live translation. Certain highly qualified voice talents are traditionally assigned to particular kinds of production, such as action or drama. Standard dubbing is not widely popular with most audiences, with the exception of cartoons and children's shows, which are dubbed also for TV releases.\n\nIt is claimed that, until around 1951, there were no revoiced foreign movies available in Poland. Instead, they were exclusively subtitled in Polish.<ref>{{cite book|title=Das kulturelle Leben der Deutschen in Niederschlesien unter polnischer Verwaltung. 1947-1958|first=Bernhard|last=Grund|publisher=Bundesministerium f\u00fcr gesamtdeutsche Fragen|place=Bonn und Berlin|date=1967|series=Bonner Berichte aus Mittel- und Ostdeutschland|page=119}}</ref>\n\nPoland's dubbing traditions began between the two world wars. In 1931, among the first movies dubbed into Polish were ''[[Dangerous Curves (1929 film)|Dangerous Curves]]'' (1929), ''[[The Dance of Life]]'' (1929), ''[[Paramount on Parade]]'' (1930), and ''[[Darling of the Gods]]'' (1930). In 1949, the first dubbing studio opened in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]. The first film dubbed that year was ''Russkiy Vopros'' (filmed 1948).\n\nPolish dubbing in the first post-war years suffered from poor synchronisation. Polish dialogues were not always audible and the cinema equipment of that time often made films sound less clear than they were. In the 1950s, Polish publicists discussed the quality of Polish versions of foreign movies.\n\nThe number of dubbed movies and the quality improved. Polish dubbing had a golden age between the 1960s and the 1980s. Approximately a third of foreign movies screened in cinemas were dubbed. The \"Polish dubbing school\" was known for its high quality. In that time, Poland had some of the best dubbing in the world. The person who initiated high-quality dubbing versions was director Zofia Dybowska-Aleksandrowicz. In that time, dubbing in Poland was very popular. Polish television dubbed popular films and TV series such as ''[[Rich Man, Poor Man (miniseries)|Rich Man, Poor Man]]''; ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', ''[[Forsyte Saga]]'', ''[[Elizabeth R]]'', ''[[I, Claudius]]'', ''[[I'll Take Manhattan (miniseries)|I'll Take Manhattan]]'', and ''[[Peter the Great (TV series)|Peter the Great]]''.\n\nIn the 1980s, due to budget cuts, state-run TV saved on tapes by voicing films over live during transmission.\n\nOverall, during 1948\u20131998, almost 1,000 films were dubbed in Polish. In the 1990s, dubbing films and TV series continued, although often also for one emission only.\n\nIn 1995, [[Canal+]] was launched in Poland. In its first years, it dubbed 30% of its schedule dubbing popular films and TV series, one of the best-known and popular dubbings was that of ''[[Friends (TV series)|Friends]]'', but this proved unsuccessful.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20151222233455/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119215016517556740 On Polish TV, Desperate Wives Sound Like Guys], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', 12 October 2007</ref> It stopped dubbing films in 1999, although many people supported the idea of dubbing and bought the access only for dubbing versions of foreign productions. In the 1990s, dubbing was done by the television channel known as [[Wizja Jeden]]. They mainly dubbed [[BBC]] productions such as ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]'', ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'' and ''[[Men Behaving Badly]]''. Wizja Jeden was closed in 2001. In the same year, TVP stopped dubbing the TV series ''[[Frasier]]'', although that dubbing was very popular.\n\nCurrently, dubbing of films and TV series for teenagers is made by Nickelodeon and Disney Channel. One of the major breakthroughs in dubbing was the Polish release of ''Shrek'', which contained many references to local culture and Polish humour. Since then, people seem to have grown to like dubbed versions more, and pay more attention to the dubbing actors.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} However, this seems to be the case only with animated films, as live-action dubbing is still considered a bad practice. In the case of [[DVD|DVD releases]], most discs contain both the original soundtrack and subtitles, and either voice over or dubbed Polish track. The dubbed version is, in most cases, the one from the theater release, while voice-over is provided for movies that were only subtitled in theaters.\n\nSince theatrical release of ''The Avengers'' in May 2012, Walt Disney Company Polska dubs all films for cinema releases. Also in 2012, [[United International Pictures]] Polska dubbed ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', while Forum Film Polska \u2013 former distributor of Disney's films \u2013 decided to dub ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'', along with its [[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug|two]] [[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|sequels]]. However, when a dub is produced but the film's target audience is not exclusively children, both dubbed and subtitled versions are usually available in movie theaters. The dubbed versions are more commonly shown in morning and early afternoon hours, with the subtitled version dominating in the evening. Both can be available in parallel at similar hours in multiplexes.\n\n=====Russia=====\n[[Russia]]n television is generally dubbed, but in the cases using voice-over dub technique with only a couple of voice actors, with the original speech still audible underneath. In the [[Soviet Union]], most foreign movies to be officially released were dubbed. Voice-over dub was invented in the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1980s when with the fall of the regime, many popular foreign movies, previously forbidden, or at least questionable under communist rule, started to flood in, in the form of low-quality home-copied videos. Being unofficial releases, they were dubbed in a very primitive way. For example, the translator spoke the text directly over the audio of a video being copied, using primitive equipment.\n\nThe quality of the resulting dub was very low, the translated phrases were off-sync, interfering with the original voices, background sounds leaked into the track, translation was inaccurate and, most importantly, all dub voices were made by a single person who usually lacked the intonation of the original, making comprehension of some scenes quite difficult. This method of translation exerted a strong influence on Russian pop culture. Voices of translators became recognizable for generations.\n\nIn modern Russia, the overdubbing technique is still used in many cases, although with vastly improved quality, and now with multiple voice actors dubbing different original voices. Video games are generally either dubbed into Russian (such as the ''Legend of Spyro'' trilogy, the ''Skylanders'' series, the ''Assassin's Creed'' saga, the ''Halo'' series, the ''Harry Potter'' series, etc.) or released with original-speaking tracks but with all the texts translated into Russian language.\n\nReleases of cinemas are almost always dubbed in the Russian language. On television series are shown as a dubbed translation and offscreen. Subtitles are not used at all.\n\n=====Ukraine=====\nIn [[Ukraine]], since 2006 cinema releases are almost always dubbed into Ukrainian with the overdubbing technique and multiple voice actors dubbing different original voices with a small percent of art-house/documentaries shown in the original language with Ukrainian subtitles. For television, TV channels usually release movies and TV-shows with a Ukrainian voiceover, although certain high-profile films and TV shows are dubbed rather than voice-overe'ed.\n\nIn the past Russian-language films, TV series, cartoons, animated series and TV programs were usually not dubbed but were shown with the original audio with Ukrainian subtitles. However, this practise has been slowly abandoned since the late 2010s: all children's films and cartoons regardless of the original language (including Russian) are always dubbed into Ukrainian; example of the first Russian cartoons dubbed into Ukrainian for the cinematic-release is [[The Snow Queen 2]] (2015), [[A Warrior's Tail]] (2015), Volki i Ovtsy: Be-e-e-zumnoe prevrashenie (2016), Ivan Tsarevich i Seryy Volk 3 (2016), Bremenskie razboyniki (2016), [[The Snow Queen 3: Fire and Ice|The Snow Queen 3: Fire and Ice (2017)]], [[Fantastic Journey to OZ]] (2017), Fixies: Top Secret (2017) etc.; the same trend is seen among Russian language feature films for adults, with the first such films dubbed into Ukrainian including [[Battle for Sevastopol|Battle for Sevastopol (2015)]], [[Hardcore Henry|Hardcore Henry (2016)]], [[The Duelist (2016 film)|The Duelist (2016)]].\n\n=====Latvia and Lithuania=====\nIn [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]], only children's movies get dubbed in the cinema, while many live-action movies for an older audience use voice-over. In recent years however, many cartoons have been dubbed into Latvian and Lithuanian for TV. But some other kids shows, like ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', use the voice-over.\n\n===Americas===\n====United States and English-speaking Canada====\nIn the United States and English-speaking Canada, [[live-action]] foreign films are usually shown in theaters with their original languages (with English subtitles). It is because live-action dubbed movies rarely did well in United States box office since the 1980s. The 1982 United States theatrical release of Wolfgang Peterson's ''[[Das Boot]]'' was the last major release to go out in both original and English-dubbed versions, and the film's original version actually grossed much higher than the English-dubbed version.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/1999/08/editorial-life-isnt-beautiful-anymore-its-dubbed-82123/|title=EDITORIAL: Life Isn't Beautiful Anymore, it's Dubbed|last=Indiewire|date=23 August 1999|accessdate=1 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/19/business/will-dubbing-fly-in-the-us-read-my-lips.html?gwh=5B7FDE5A22B394D810DA99A95EFCDECB&gwt=pay|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805152511/https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/19/business/will-dubbing-fly-in-the-us-read-my-lips.html?gwh=5B7FDE5A22B394D810DA99A95EFCDECB&gwt=pay|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 August 2018|title=Will Dubbing Fly in the U.S.?

The exceptions to this practice are either when an English dub has not been produced for the program (usually in the case of feature films) or when the program is being presented by a network that places importance on presenting it in its original format (as was the case when [[Turner Classic Movies]] aired several of [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s works, which were presented both dubbed and subtitled). Most [[anime]] DVDs contain options for original Japanese, Japanese with subtitles, and English-dubbed, except for a handful of series that have been heavily edited or [[Americanized|Americanised]]. In addition, Disney has a policy that makes its directors undergo stages to perfect alignment of certain lip movements so the movie looks believable.\n\nIn addition, a small number of British films have been re-dubbed when released in the United States, due to the usage of dialects which Americans are not familiar with (for example, ''[[Kes (film)|Kes]]'' and ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]''). However, British children's shows (such as ''[[Bob the Builder]]'') are always re-dubbed with American voice actors in order to make the series more understandable for American children. Conversely, British programs shown in Canada are not re-dubbed.\n\nSome television shows shown in the US have Spanish dubs.  These are accessible though the SAP (secondary audio program) function of the television unit.\n\n====Spanish-speaking countries====\nFor Spanish-speaking countries, all foreign-language programs, films, cartoons and documentaries shown on free-to-air TV networks are dubbed into [[Standard Spanish]], while broadcasts on [[Cable television|cable]] and [[Satellite television|satellite]] pan-regional channels are either dubbed or subtitled. In theaters, children's movies and most blockbuster films are dubbed into Standard Spanish or [[Mexican Spanish]], and are sometimes further dubbed into regional dialects of Spanish where they are released.\n\n====Mexico====\nIn [[Mexico]], by law, films shown in theaters must be shown in their original version. Films in languages other than Spanish are usually subtitled. Only educational documentaries and movies rated for children, as well as some movies that are expected to have a wide audience (for example, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' or ''[[Marvel's The Avengers|The Avengers]]'') may be dubbed, but this is not compulsory, and some animated films are shown in theaters in both dubbed and subtitled versions (for instance, some [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]] productions). Nonetheless, a recent trend in several cinemas is to offer the dubbed versions only, with a stark decrease in the showing of the original ones.\n\nDubbing must be made in Mexico by Mexican nationals or foreigners residing in Mexico.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/103.pdf |title=Ley Federal de Cinematograf\u00eda |language=Spanish |trans-title=Federal Law of Filmmaking |publisher=C\u00e1mara de Diputados |date=28 April 2010 |accessdate=22 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722125937/http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/103.pdf |archivedate=22 July 2011  }}</ref> Still, several programs that are shown on pay TV are dubbed in other countries like [[Venezuela]], [[Chile]] or [[Colombia]].\n\nMost movies released on DVD feature [[Standard Spanish|neutral Spanish]] as a language option, and sometimes feature a specific dub for Mexican audiences (for example, ''Rio''). Foreign programs are dubbed on [[broadcast television systems|broadcast TV]], while on [[pay TV]] most shows and movies are subtitled. In a similar way to cinemas, in the last few years many channels on pay TV have begun to broadcast programs and films only in their dubbed version.\n\nDubbing became very popular in the 1990s with the rise in popularity of anime in Mexico. Some voice actors have become celebrities and are always identified with specific characters, such as [[Mario Casta\u00f1eda]] (who became popular by dubbing [[Goku]] in ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'') or [[Humberto V\u00e9lez]] (who dubbed [[Homer Simpson]] in the first 15 seasons of ''[[The Simpsons]]'').\n\nThe popularity of pay TV has allowed people to view several series in their original language rather than dubbed. Dubbing has been criticised for the use of TV or movie stars as voice actors (such as [[Ricky Martin]] in Disney's ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]'', or [[Eugenio Derbez]] in DreamWorks' ''Shrek''), or for the incorrect use of local popular culture that sometimes creates unintentional jokes or breaks the feeling of the original work (such as translating [[Sheldon Cooper]]'s \"Bazinga!\" to \"\u00a1Vacil\u00f3n!\").\n\nSeveral video games have been dubbed into neutral Spanish, rather than European Spanish, in Mexico (such as the ''Gears of War'' series, ''Halo 3'', ''Infamous 2'' and others). [[Sony]] recently announced that more games (such as ''God of War: Ascension'') will be dubbed into neutral Spanish.\n\n====Peru====\nIn [[Peru]], all foreign series, movies, and animated programming are shown dubbed in Latin American Spanish, with dubs imported from Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Venezuela on terrestrial and pay-television. Most movies intended for kids are being offered as dub-only movies, while most films aimed at older audiences are being offered dubbed and subtitled in Spanish. Also, at most theaters, kids films (on rare occasions) subtitled are commonly shown at nighttime. Most subtitled Pay-TV channels show both dubbed and subtitled version of every film they broadcast, being offered with a separate subtitle track and a second audio track in English. There is an increase of people preferring subtitle films and series rather than dubbed starting the late-2000s, as Peruvians viewers tend to get used to their original version.\n\nPeru used to do not produce their own dubs since dubbing studios never existed in that country until 2016, when the company \"Big Bang Films\" started to dub movies and series, however, since 2014 a group of dubbing actors created a group called \"Torre A Doblaje\", who is a group of actors who gives dubbing and locution service.\n\n====Brazil====\nIn [[Brazil]], foreign programs are invariably dubbed into [[Brazilian Portuguese]] on [[free to air TV]], with only a few exceptions. Films shown at cinemas are generally offered with both subtitled and dubbed versions, with dubbing frequently being the only choice for children's movies. Subtitling was primarily for adult audience movies until 2012. Since then, dubbed versions also became available for all ages. As a result, in recent years, more cinemas have opened in Brazil, attracting new audiences to the cinema who prefer dubbing. According to a [[Datafolha]] survey, 56% of Brazilian movie theaters' audience prefer to watch dubbed movies.<ref>http://revistaepoca.globo.com/cultura/noticia/2012/06/dublagem-venceu-legendas.html</ref> Most of the dubbing studios in Brazil is in the cities of [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[S\u00e3o Paulo]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140319091221/http://ne10.uol.com.br/canal/cultura/noticia/2012/05/27/cresce-preferencia-por-filmes-dublados-nos-cinemas-brasileiros-344927.php Cresce prefer\u00eancia por filmes dublados nos cinemas brasileiros (in Portuguese)] Ne10, 27 May 2012.

By the end of the 1950s, most of the movies, TV series and cartoons on television in Brazil were shown in its original sound and subtitles. However, in 1962, a decree of President [[J\u00e2nio Quadros]] ruled that all foreign productions on television should be dubbed. This measure boosted the growth of dubbing in Brazil, and has led to several dubbing studios since then.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://mundoestranho.abril.com.br/cinema-e-tv/quando-surgiu-a-dublagem-no-brasil-e-no-mundo/ | title=Quando surgiu a dublagem no Brasil e no mundo?}}</ref> The biggest dubbing studio in Brazil was [[Herbert Richers]], headquartered in [[Rio de Janeiro (city)|Rio de Janeiro]] and closed in 2009, At its peak in the 80s and 90s, the Herbert Richers studios dubbed about 70% of the productions shown in Brazilian cinemas.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://super.abril.com.br/mundo-estranho/quem-e-herbert-richers/ |title = Quem \u00e9 Herbert Richers?}}</ref>\n\nIn the 90's, with Saint Seiya, Dragon Ball and other anime shows becoming popular in Brazilian TV's, the voice actors and the dubbing career gained a higher space in Brazilian culture. Actors like [[Hermes Baroli]] (Brazilian dubber of [[Pegasus Seiya]], in ''[[Saint Seiya]]'' and actors like [[Ashton Kutcher]]), [[Marco Ribeiro]] (Brazilian dubber of many actors like [[Tom Hanks]], [[Jim Carrey]] and [[Robert Downey Jr.]], and [[Yusuke Urameshi]] from the anime ''[[Yu Yu Hakusho]]'') and [[Wendel Bezerra]] (Brazilian dubber of [[Goku]] in ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' and [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]] in ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'') are recognised for their most notable roles.\n\nPay TV commonly offers both dubbed and subtitled movies, with statistics showing that dubbed versions are becoming predominant.<ref>[http://oglobo.globo.com/revista-da-tv/dublagem-em-canais-de-tv-paga-provoca-polemica-3262532 Dublagem em canais de TV paga provoca pol\u00eamica (in Portuguese)] O Globo, 20 November 2011. Retrieved 17 August 2012.</ref> Most [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] releases usually feature Portuguese, Spanish, and the original audio along with subtitles in native languages. Most video games are dubbed in Brazilian Portuguese rather than having European Portuguese dubs alone. Games such as ''[[Halo 3]]'', ''[[God of War: Ascension]]'', ''[[inFamous 2]]'', ''[[Assassin's Creed III]]'', ''[[Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure]]'', ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' and others are dubbed in Brazilian Portuguese. This is because despite the dropping of the dubbing law in Portugal in 1994, most companies in that country use the Brazilian Portuguese because of traditional usage during the days of the dubbing rule, along with these dubbings being more marketable than European Portuguese.\n\nA list that showcases Brazilian Portuguese voice artists that dub for actors and actresses are displayed here. However, there can also be different official dub artists for certain regions within Brazil. \n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n! Brazilian Portuguese dubbing artists !!

They speak with a mixed accent, they pronounce /\u025b\u0303/ with a Parisian accent, but they pronounce \"\u00e2\" and \"\u00ea\" with a Quebec accent: ''gr\u00e2ce'' [\u0261\u0281\u0251\u02d0s] and ''\u00eatre'' [\u025b\u02d0t\u0281\u0325]. Occasionally, the dubbing of a series or a movie, such as ''The Simpsons'', is made using the more widely spoken ''[[joual]]'' variety of Quebec French. Dubbing has the advantage of making children's films and TV series more comprehensible to younger audiences. However, many [[bilingual]] Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois prefer subtitling, since they would understand some or all of the original audio. In addition, all films are shown in English, as well in certain theaters (especially in major cities and English-speaking areas such as the [[West Island]]), and some theatres, such as the Scotiabank Cinema [[Montreal]], show only movies in English. Most American television series are only available in English on [[DVD]], or on English-language channels, but some of the more popular ones have French dubs shown on mainstream networks, and are released in French on DVD as well, sometimes separately from an English-only version.\n\nFormerly, all French-language dubbed films in Quebec were imported from France and some still are. Such a practice was criticised by former politician [[Mario Dumont]] after he took his children to see the [[Standard French|Parisian French]] dub of ''Shrek the Third'', which Dumont found incomprehensible.<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/quebec-pressing-hollywood-to-justify-lack-of-movie-dubbing/article1352554/ Quebec pressing Hollywood to justify lack of movie dubbing], The Canadian Press, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', 26 May 2008</ref> After his complaints and a proposed bill, ''[[Bee Movie]]'', the film from [[DreamWorks Animation]], was dubbed in Quebec, making it the studio's first animated film to have a Quebec French dub, as all DreamWorks Animation films had previously been dubbed in France.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dr\u00f4le d'abeille (v.o.a) Bee Movie |url=http://doublage.qc.ca/showMovie.php?id=1981 |work=Doublage.qc.ca |publisher=idgrafix |accessdate=30 July 2012 |author=Doublage.qc.ca |language=French}}</ref> In terms of Disney, the first Disney animated film to be dubbed in Quebec was ''Oliver and Company.'' The Disney Renaissance films were also dubbed in Quebec except for ''The Rescuers Down Under'', ''Beauty and the Beast'', and ''The Lion King''.\n\nIn addition, because Canadian viewers usually find Quebec French more comprehensible than other dialects of the language, some older film series that had the French-language versions of previous installments dubbed in France have had later ones dubbed in Quebec, often creating inconsistencies within the French version of the series' canon. [[Lucasfilm]]'s ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' series are examples. Both series had films released in the 1970s and 1980s, with no Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois French dubbed versions; instead, the Parisian French versions, with altered character and object names and terms, were distributed in the province. However, later films in both series released 1999 and later were dubbed in Quebec, using different voice actors and \"reversing\" name changes made in France's dubbings due to the change in studio.\n\n===Asia===\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2013}}\n\n====China====\nChina has a long tradition of dubbing foreign films into [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], starting in the 1930s. While during the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] era Western motion pictures may have been imported and dubbed into Chinese, since 1950 [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet movies]], dubbed primarily in Shanghai, became the main import.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|1987|p=40}}</ref> Beginning in the late 1970s, in addition to films, popular TV series from the United States, Japan, Brazil, and Mexico were also dubbed. The [[Shanghai]] Film Dubbing Studio has been the most well-known studio in the film dubbing industry in China. In order to generate high-quality products, they divide each film into short segments, each one lasting only a few minutes, and then work on the segments one-by-one. In addition to the correct meaning in translation, they make tremendous effort to match the lips of the actors to the dialogue. As a result, the dubbing in these films generally is not readily detected. The cast of dubbers is acknowledged at the end of a dubbed film. Several dubbing actors and actresses of the Shanghai Film Dubbing Studio have become well-known celebrities, such as Qiu Yuefeng, Bi Ke, Li Zi, and Liu Guangning. In recent years, however, especially in the larger cities on the east and south coasts, it has become increasingly common for movie theaters to show subtitled versions with the original soundtracks intact.\n\nMotion pictures are also dubbed into the languages of some of China's [[Autonomous administrative divisions of China|autonomous regions]]. Notably, the Translation Department of the [[Tibetan Autonomous Region]] Movie Company (\u897f\u85cf\u81ea\u6cbb\u533a\u7535\u5f71\u516c\u53f8\u8bd1\u5236\u79d1)<ref name=humes20131122>[http://www.bruce-humes.com/?p=9736 Confucius the Movie: China Flop Dubbed at the State\u2019s Expense for Tibetan Movie-goers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131130085415/http://www.bruce-humes.com/?p=9736 |date=30 November 2013 }}, 22 November 2013</ref> has been dubbing movies into the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan language]] since the 1960s.

Until the mid-1990s, the major national [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial channels]] both dubbed and subtitled all foreign programs and films and, for some popular programs, the original voices were offered in [[second audio program]]. Gradually, however, both terrestrial and cable channels stopped dubbing for [[prime time]] U.S. shows and films, while subtitling continued.\n\nIn the 2000s, the dubbing practice has differed depending on the nature and origin of the program. Animations, children's shows and some educational programs on PTS are mostly dubbed. English live-action movies and shows are not dubbed in theaters or on television. Japanese TV dramas are no longer dubbed, while [[Korean language|Korean]] dramas, [[Hong Kong]] dramas and dramas from other Asian countries are still often dubbed. Korean variety shows are not dubbed. Japanese and Korean films on Asian movie channels are still dubbed. In theaters, most foreign films are not dubbed, while animated films and some films meant for children offer a dubbed version. Hong Kong live-action films have a long tradition of being dubbed into Mandarin, while more famous films offer a [[Cantonese]] version.\n\n====Hong Kong====\nIn [[Hong Kong]], foreign television programmes, except for English-language and Mandarin television programmes, are dubbed in Cantonese. English-language and Mandarin programmes are generally shown in their original with subtitles. Foreign films, such as most live-action and animated films (such as anime and Disney), are usually dubbed in Cantonese. However most cinemas also offer subtitled versions of English-language films.\n\nFor the most part, foreign films and TV programmes, both live-action and animated, are generally dubbed in both Mandarin and Cantonese. For example, in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' film series, Elijah Wood's character [[Frodo Baggins]] was dubbed into Mandarin by [[Jiang Guangtao]] for China and Taiwan. For the Cantonese localisation, there were actually two dubs for Hong Kong and [[Macau]]. The first Cantonese dub, he was voiced by Leung Wai Tak, with a second Cantonese dub released, he was voiced by Bosco Tang.\n\nA list for Mandarin and Cantonese voice artists that dub for actors are shown here.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

In programs aimed at teenagers and adults, dubbing is rarely considered for translation, not only because of its high costs, but also because the audience is mainly multi-lingual. Most viewers in Israel speak at least one European language in addition to Hebrew, and a large part of the audience also speaks [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. Therefore, most viewers prefer to hear the original soundtrack, aided by Hebrew subtitles. Another problem is that dubbing does not allow for translation into two different languages simultaneously, as is often the case of Israeli television channels that use subtitles in Hebrew and another language (like [[Russian language|Russian]]) simultaneously.\n\n====Japan====\nIn Japan, many television programs appear on Japanese television subtitled or dubbed if they are intended for children. When the American film ''[[Morocco (film)|Morocco]]'' was released in Japan in 1931, subtitles became the mainstream method of translating TV programs and films in Japan. Later, around the 1950s, foreign television programs and films began to be shown dubbed in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] on television. The first ones to be dubbed into Japanese were [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|the 1940s Superman cartoons]] in 1955.\n\nDue to the lack of video software for domestic television, video software was imported from abroad. When the television program was shown on television, it was mostly dubbed. There was a character limit for a small TV screen at a lower resolution, and this method was not suitable for the poor elderly and illiterate eye, as was audio dubbing. Presently, TV shows and movies (both those aimed at all ages and adults-only) are shown dubbed with the original language and Japanese subtitles, while providing the original language option when the same film is released on [[VHS]], [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]]. Laserdisc releases of Hollywood films were almost always subtitled.\n\nAdult cartoons such as ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', and ''[[The Simpsons]]'' are shown dubbed in Japanese on the [[WOWOW]] TV channel. ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut]]'' was dubbed in Japanese by different actors instead of the same Japanese dubbing-actors from the cartoon because it was handled by a different Japanese dubbing studio, and it was marketed for the [[Kansai region|Kansai]] market. In Japanese theaters, foreign-language movies, except those intended for children, are usually shown in their original version with Japanese subtitles. Foreign films usually contain multiple Japanese-dubbing versions, but with several different original Japanese-dubbing voice actors, depending upon which TV station they are aired. [[NHK]], [[Nippon TV]], [[Fuji TV]], [[TV Asahi]], and [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] usually follow this practice, as do software releases on [[VHS]], [[Laserdisc]], [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]]. As for recent foreign films being released, there are now some film theaters in Japan that show both dubbed and subtitled editions.\n\nOn 22 June 2009, [[20th Century Fox]]'s Japanese division has opened up a [[Blu-ray]] lineup known as \"Emperor of Dubbing\", dedicated at having multiple Japanese dubs of popular English-language films (mostly Hollywood films) as well as retaining the original scripts, releasing them altogether in special Blu-ray releases. These also feature a new dub created exclusively for that release as a director's cut, or a new dub made with a better surround sound mix to match that of the original English mix (as most older Japanese dubbings were made on mono mixes to be aired on TV). Other companies have followed practice, like Universal Pictures's Japanese division [[NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan]] opening up \"Reprint of Memories\", along with [[:ja:\u30ef\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc \u30a8\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30c6\u30a4\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8 \u30b8\u30e3\u30d1\u30f3|Warner Bros Japan]] having \"Power of Dubbing\", which act in a similar way by re-packaging all the multiple Japanese dubs of popular films and putting them out as Special Blu-ray releases.\n\n\"Japanese dub-over artists\" provide the voices for certain performers, such as those listed in the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

However, some anime is censored, such as Japanese letters or content being edited for a suitable Korean audience. Western cartoons are dubbed in Korean as well, such as [[Nickelodeon]] cartoons like ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' and ''[[Danny Phantom]]''. Several English-language (mostly American) live-action films are dubbed in [[Korean language|Korean]], but they are not shown in theaters. Instead they are only broadcast on South Korean television networks ([[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]], [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]], [[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]], [[Educational Broadcasting System|EBS]]), while DVD import releases of these films are shown with Korean subtitles, such as ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, and ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''. This may be due to the fact that the six American [[major film studio]]s may not own any rights to the Korean dubs of their live-action films that the Korean television networks have dubbed and aired. Even if they don't own the rights, Korean or non-Korean viewers can record from Korean-dubbed live-action films from television broadcasting onto DVDs with [[Digital video recorder|DVRs]].\n\nSometimes, video games are dubbed in Korean. Examples would be the ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' series, the ''[[Jak & Daxter (series)|Jak & Daxter]]'' series, and the ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' series. For the ''Halo'' games, Lee Jeong Gu provides his Korean voice to the main protagonist [[Characters of Halo|Master Chief]] (replacing [[Steve Downes]]'s voice), while [[Kim So Hyeong (voice actor)|Kim So Hyeong]] voices [[Characters of Halo|Chieftain Tartarus]], one of the main antagonists (replacing [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]'s voice).\n\nThe following South Korean voice-over artists are usually identified with the following actors:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Movie theaters in [[Bangkok]] and some larger cities show both the subtitled version and the dubbed version of English-language movies. In big cities like Bangkok, Thai-language movies have English subtitles. <!-- For English-language animated movies, Disney films like ''[[The Lion King]]'', ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' and ''[[Tangled]]'' are dubbed entirely in Thai.\n\nChonnai Sukawat has provided the Thai-dubbing voice for the heroine Rapunzel in the film ''Tangled''. In the Thai version of ''Harry Potter'', [[Hermione Granger]] was dubbed by Thai singer and actress Bismillah Nana. Many English-language movies are sold on [[VCD]]s in Thailand, with the original English language and Thai subtitles, while also available with the Thai-language-dubbed version, such as ''[[Eragon (film)|Eragon]]'', ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', the ''Harry Potter'' film series, and ''The Lord of the Rings'' film series.

Then a few months or years later, those movies appear on TV either dubbed in Indonesian or subtitled. Kids shows are mostly dubbed, though even in cartoon series, songs aren't dubbed, but in big movies such as Disney movies, both speaking and singing voice were cast for the new Indonesian dub even though it took maybe a few months or even years for the movie to come out. Adult films was mostly subtitled, but sometimes they can be dubbed as well and because there aren't many Indonesian voices, especially in dubbed movies, three characters can have the exact same voice.\n\nReality shows are never dubbed in Indonesian, because they are not a planned interaction like with movies and TV shows, so if they appear in TV, they will be appear with subtitles.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

In general, the decision whether to dub a video production depends mainly on the target audience of the channel on which the feature will be aired, its genre, and/or outlet of transmission (e.g. TV or film, free or pay-TV).  \n\n=====Free-to-air TV=====\nThe prevalence of media needing to be dubbed has resulted in a talent pool that is very capable of syncing voice to lip, especially for shows broadcast by the country's three largest networks. It is not uncommon in the Filipino dub industry to have most of the voices in a series dubbing by only a handful of voice talents. Programmes originally in English used to usually air in their original language on free-to-air television. \n\nSince the late 1990s/early 2000s, however, more originally English-language programmes that air on major free-to-air networks (i.e. 5, ABS-CBN, GMA) have been dubbed into Filipino. Even the former Studio 23 (now S+A), once known for its airing programmes in English, had adopted Filipino-language dubbing for some of its foreign programmes. Children's programmes from cable networks [[Nickelodeon]], [[Cartoon Network]], and [[Disney Channel]] shown on [[TV5 (Philippines)|5]], GMA, or ABS-CBN, have long been dubbed into Filipino or another Philippine regional language.  [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Animated Disney films]] are often dubbed in Filipino except for the singing scenes, which are shown in their original language (though in recent years, there has been an increase in number of Disney musicals having their songs also translated such as ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'').  [[GMA News TV]] airs some documentaries, movies, and reality series originally shown in the English language as dubbed in Filipino.  \n\nDubbing is less common in smaller free-to-air networks such as [[ETC (Philippine TV channel)|ETC]] and the former [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN 9]] (now CNN Philippines) whereby the original-language version of the programme is aired. Dramas from Asia (particularly Greater China and Korea) and Latin America (called ''Asianovelas'', and ''Mexicanovelas'', respectively) have always been dubbed into Filipino or another Philippine regional language, and each programme from these genres feature their unique set of Filipino-speaking voice actors.\n\n=====Pay TV=====\nThe original language-version of TV programmes is also usually available on cable/satellite channels such as [[Fox Life]], [[Fox Asia|Fox]], and AXN. However, some pay-TV channels specialise in showing foreign shows and films dubbed into Filipino. [[Cinema One]], ABS-CBN's cable movie channel, shows some films originally in non-English language dubbed into Filipino. [[Nat Geo Wild]] airs most programs dubbed into Filipino for Philippine audiences, being one of the few cable channels to do so. [[Tagalized Movie Channel|Tagalised Movie Channel]] & [[Tag (TV channel)|Tag]] airs Hollywood and Asian movies dubbed in Filipino. [[Fox Filipino]] airs some English, Latin, and Asian series dubbed in Filipino such as ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'', ''[[Devious Maids]]'', ''La Teniente'', ''Kdabra'', and some selected programs from [[Channel M (Southeast Asia)|Channel M]].  The defunct channel [[Hero (TV channel)|HERO TV]], which focuses on anime and [[tokusatsu]] shows and now a web portal, dubs all its foreign programs into Filipino. This is in contrast to Animax, where their anime programs are dubbed in English.\n\n=====Cinema=====\nForeign films, especially English films shown in local cinemas, are almost always shown in their original language.  Non-English foreign films make use of English subtitles. Unlike other countries, children's films originally in English are not dubbed in cinemas.\n\nA list of voice actors with their associates that they dub into Filipino are listed here.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Dubbing is rarely done with the other major Indian languages, namely [[Malayalam]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]], due to lack of significant market size. Despite this, some [[Kannada language|Kannada]] and [[Malayalam]] dubs of children television programs can be seen on the [[Sun TV Network|Sun TV]] channel. The dubbed versions are released into the towns and lower tier settlements of the respective states (where English penetration is low), often with the English-language originals released in the metropolitan areas. In all other states, the English originals are released along with the dubbed versions, where often the dubbed version collections are more outstanding than the originals. ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' was also done in the [[Bhojpuri language]], a language popular in [[East India|eastern India]] in addition to Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. ''[[A Good Day to Die Hard]]'', the most recent installment in the ''[[Die Hard (franchise)|Die Hard]]'' franchise, was the first ever Hollywood film to receive a [[Punjabi language|Punjabi language dub]] as well. \n\nMost TV channels mention neither the Indian-language dubbing credits, nor its staff, at the end of the original ending credits, since changing the credits casting for the original actors or voice actors involves a huge budget for modifying, making it somewhat difficult to find information for the dubbed versions. The same situation is encountered for films. Sometimes foreign programs and films receive more than one dub, such as for example, [[Jumanji]], [[Dragonheart]] and [[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]] having two Hindi dubs. Information for the Hindi, Tamil and Telugu voice actors who have done the voices for specific actors and for their roles on foreign films and television programs are published in local Indian data magazines, for those that are involved in the dubbing industry in India. But on a few occasions, there are some foreign productions that do credit the dubbing cast, such as animated films like the ''[[Barbie (film series)|Barbie]]'' films, and some Disney films. [[Disney Channel]] original series released on DVD with their Hindi dubs show a list of the artists in the Hindi dub credits, after the original ending credits. Theatrical releases and VCD releases of foreign films do not credit the dubbing cast or staff. The DVD releases, however, do have credits for the dubbing staff, if they are released multilingual. As of recently, information for the dubbing staff of foreign productions have been expanding due to high demands of people wanting to know the voice actors behind characters in foreign works. Large dubbing studios in India include [[Sound & Vision India]], [[Main Frame Software Communications]], [[Visual Reality]], [[ZamZam Productions]], [[Treasure Tower International]], [[Blue Whale Entertainment]], [[Jai Hand Entertainment]], [[Sugar Mediaz]] and [[Rudra Sound Solutionz]].\n\n====Pakistan====\nIn [[Pakistan]] \"foreign films\", and cartoons are not normally dubbed locally. Instead, foreign films, anime and cartoons, such as those shown on [[Nickelodeon Pakistan]] and [[Cartoon Network Pakistan]], are dubbed in [[Hindi]] in India, as Hindi and [[Urdu]], the national language of Pakistan, are [[mutually intelligible]].\nHowever, soap operas from [[Turkey]] are now dubbed in Urdu and have gained increased popularity at the expense of Indian soap operas in Hindi.<ref>[http://www.firstpost.com/living/in-pakistan-indian-soap-operas-give-way-to-turkish-serials-1260549.html In Pakistan, Indian soap operas give way to Turkish serials], ''[[First Post (India)|First Post]]'', 1 December 2013</ref> This has led to protests from local producers that these are a threat to Pakistan's television industry, with local productions being moved out of peak viewing time or dropped altogether.<ref>[http://www.dawn.com/news/772593/is-tv-drama-industry-overreacting-to-turkish-soaps-blitz Is TV drama industry overreacting to Turkish soaps blitz?], ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'', 20 December 2012</ref> Similarly, politicians leaders have expressed concerns over their content, given Turkey's less conservative culture.<ref>[http://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/10/the-geopolitics-of-soap-operas/ The Geopolitics of Soap Operas], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 10 January 2013</ref>\n\n====Vietnam====\nIn [[Vietnam]], foreign-language films and programs are subtitled on television in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. They were not dubbed until 1985, but are briefly translated with a speaker before commercial breaks. ''[[Rio (2011 film)|Rio]]'' was considered to be the very first American Hollywood film to be entirely dubbed in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. Since then, children's films that came out afterwards have been released dubbed in theaters. [[HTV3]] has dubbed television programs for children, including ''[[Ben 10 (TV series)|Ben 10]]'', and ''[[Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide]]'', by using various voice actors to dub over the character roles.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHBlXxqhKwU |title=Ben 10 Vietnamese Trailer (Trailer Ben 10 - HTV3) |publisher=YouTube |date=18 October 2011 |accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WbgyJP5-TA |title=HTV3 - C\u1ea9m Nang C\u1ee7a Ned - Trailer |publisher=YouTube |date=10 August 2012 |accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nSooner afterwards, more programs started to get dubbed. HTV3 also offers anime dubbed into Vietnamese. [[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|Pok\u00e9mon]] got a Vietnamese dub in early 2014 on HTV3 starting with the Best Wishes series. But due to a controversy regarding Pok\u00e9mon's cries being re-dubbed despite that all characters had their Japanese names, it was switched to [[VTV2]] in September 2015 when the XY series debut. [[Sailor Moon (anime)|Sailor Moon]] also recently has been dubbed for HTV3 in early 2015.\n\n====Singapore====\nIn multilingual [[Singapore]], dubbing is rare for western programmes. English-language programmes on the free-to-air terrestrial channels are usually subtitled in Chinese or Malay. Chinese, Malay and Tamil programmes (except for news bulletins), usually have subtitles in English and the original language during the prime time hours. [[Dual sound]] programs, such as Korean and Japanese dramas, offer sound in the original languages with subtitles, Mandarin-dubbed and subtitled, or English-dubbed. The [[Speak Mandarin Campaign|deliberate policy to encourage Mandarin]] among citizens made it required by law for programs in other Chinese dialects ([[Min Nan|Hokkien]], Cantonese and [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]]) to be dubbed into Mandarin, with the exception of traditional [[opera]]s. Cantonese and Hokkien shows from Hong Kong and Taiwan, respectively, are available on VCD and DVD. In a recent development, news bulletins are subtitled.\n\n====Iran====\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n[[File:Iranian Dubbing artists.jpg|thumb|A group of Iranian dubbing artists]]\nIn [[Iran]], foreign films and television programs are dubbed in [[Persian language|Persian]]. Dubbing began in 1946 with the advent of movies and cinemas in the country. Since then, foreign movies have always been dubbed for the cinema and TV. Using various voice actors and adding local hints and witticisms to the original contents, dubbing played a major role in attracting people to the cinemas and developing an interest in other cultures. The dubbing art in Iran reached its apex during the 1960s and 1970s with the inflow of American, European and Hindi movies.\n\nThe most famous musicals of the time, such as ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' and ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', were translated, adjusted and performed in Persian by the voice artists. Since the 1990s, for political reasons and under pressure from the state, the dubbing industry has declined, with movies dubbed only for the state TV channels. During recent years, DVDs with Persian subtitles have found a market among viewers for the same reason, but most people still prefer the Persian-speaking dubbed versions. Recently, privately operated companies started dubbing TV series by hiring famous dubbers.\n\nA list of Persian voice actors that associate with their actor counterparts are listed here.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

There are exceptions, such as some children's cartoons.\n\n====Azerbaijan====\nIn [[Azerbaijan]], dubbing is rare, as most Azerbaijani channels such as [[G\u00fcn\u0259\u015f TV|ARB G\u00fcn\u0259\u015f]] air [[voice-over]]s or Azerbaijan originals.\n\n====Western Asia====\nSee [[#North Africa, Western Asia|below]].\n\n===Africa===\n====North Africa, Western Asia====\nIn [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], and Tunisia, most foreign movies (especially Hollywood productions) are shown dubbed in French. These movies are usually imported directly from French film distributors. The choice of movies dubbed into French can be explained by the widespread use of the French language. Another important factor is that local theaters and private media companies do not dub in local languages in order to avoid high costs, but also because of the lack of both expertise and demand.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, dubbed series and movies for children in [[Modern Standard Arabic]] became a popular choice among most TV channels, cinemas and VHS/DVD stores. However, dubbed films are still imported, and dubbing is performed in the [[Levant]] countries with a strong tradition of dubbing (mainly [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Jordan]]).\n\nIn the Arabic-speaking countries, some children shows (mainly cartoons) are dubbed in Arabic, otherwise Arabic subtitles are used. The only exception was [[telenovelas]] dubbed in Standard Arabic, or dialects, but also Turkish series, most notably [[G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015f (TV series)|G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015f]], in Syrian Arabic.\n\nAn example of Arabic voice actors that dub for certain performers is Safi Mohammed for [[Elijah Wood]].\n\nIn [[Tunisia]], the Tunisia National Television (TNT), the public broadcaster of Tunisia, is not allowed to show any content in any language other than Arabic, which forces it to broadcast only dubbed content (this restriction was recently removed for commercials). During the 1970s and 1980s, TNT (known as ERTT at the time) started dubbing famous cartoons in Tunisian and Standard Arabic. However, in the private sector, television channels are not subject to the language rule.\n\n====South Africa====\nIn [[South Africa]], many television programmes were dubbed in [[Afrikaans]], with the original soundtrack (usually in English, but sometimes [[Dutch language|Dutch]] or [[German language|German]]) \"[[simulcast]]\" in [[FM stereo#Stereo FM|FM stereo]] on [[Radio 2000]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-NRDAQAAIAAJ&dq=was+simulcast++Radio+2000+afrikaans&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Radio+2000+afrikaans ''The voice, the vision: a sixty year history of the South African Broadcasting Corporation''], Malcolm Theunissen, Victor Nikitin, Melanie Pillay, Advent Graphics, 1996, page 120</ref> These included US series such as ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'', ''(Steve Austin: Die Man van Staal)''<ref>[http://www.tvsa.co.za/mastershowinfo.asp?mastershowid=2293 The Six Million Dollar Man], TVSA - The South African TV Authority</ref> ''[[Miami Vice]]'' ''(Misdaad in Miami)'',<ref>{{cite news |title=Shows Allow Blacks, Whites to Share Cultural Experiences : South African Viewers Get a Mixed TV Message From U.S. Programs |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1986-05-25/news/mn-7271_1_south-african |accessdate=14 August 2012 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=25 May 1986|author=GLENN FRANKEL (from ''The Washington Post'')}}</ref> ''[[Beverly Hills 90210]]'',<ref>[http://mg.co.za/article/1996-02-09-the-critics-thumbs-up/ The critics' thumbs-up], ''[[Mail & Guardian]]'', 9 February 1996</ref> and the German detective series ''[[Derrick (TV series)|Derrick]]''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7h1DAQAAIAAJ&dq=derrick+tv+series+afrikaans&q=derrick+|title=Mass Media, Towards the Millennium|isbn=9780627023248|accessdate=9 July 2015|last1=Beer|first1=Arrie De|year=1998}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the [[boycott]] by the [[United Kingdom|British]] actors' union [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]], which banned the sale of most British television programmes, the [[puppet]] series ''[[The Adventures of Rupert Bear]]'' was dubbed into [[South African English]], as the original voices had been recorded by Equity voice artists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://upetd.up.ac.za/thesis/available/etd-05212009-182219/unrestricted/07chapter7.pdf |last=Bevan |first=C |year=2008 |title=Putting up screens: A history of television in South Africa, 1929-1976, MHCS dissertation, University of Pretoria, Pretoria |accessdate=1 January 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215155949/http://upetd.up.ac.za/thesis/available/etd-05212009-182219/unrestricted/07chapter7.pdf |archivedate=15 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nThis practice has declined as a result of the reduction of airtime for the language on [[SABC]] TV, and the increase of locally produced material in Afrikaans on other channels like [[KykNet]]. Similarly, many programmes, such as ''[[The Jeffersons]]'', were dubbed into [[Zulu language|Zulu]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Lelyveld |first=Joseph |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/22/magazine/22SAFR.html?&pagewanted=all |title=South Africa: Dream and Reality |work=The New York Times Magazine |date=22 September 1985 |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref> but this has also declined as local drama production has increased. However, some animated films, such as ''[[Maya the Bee]]'', have been dubbed in both Afrikaans and Zulu by local artists.<ref>[http://www.channel24.co.za/Movies/News/Maya-the-Bee-flick-dubbed-into-Afrikaans-and-Zulu-for-SA-audience-20150910 Maya the Bee flick dubbed into Afrikaans and Zulu for SA audience], [[News24|Channel24]], 18 September 2015</ref>\n\n====Uganda====\nUganda's [[Cinema of Uganda|own film industry]] is fairly small, and foreign movies are commonly watched. The English sound track is often accompanied by the [[Luganda]] translation and comments, provided by an Ugandan \"video jockey\" (VJ). VJ's interpreting and narration may be available in a recorded form or live.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/baobab/2012/11/cinema-uganda |title=Coming to you live\n|date=2 November 2012|journal=The Economist|first=M|last=H}}</ref>\n\n===Oceania===\nIn common with other English-speaking countries, there has traditionally been little dubbing in [[Australia]], with foreign language television programmes and films being shown (usually on [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]]) with subtitles or English dubs produced in other countries. This has also been the case in [[New Zealand]], but the [[M\u0101ori Television Service]], launched in 2004, has dubbed animated films into [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]].<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10117134 Maori TV broadens horizons], ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', 26 March 2005</ref> However, some TV commercials from foreign countries are dubbed, even if the original commercial came from another English-speaking country.  Moreover, the off-screen narration portions of some non-fiction programmes originating from the UK or North America are re-dubbed by Australian voice talents to relay information in expressions that Australians can understand more easily.\n\n==Alternatives==\n===Subtitles===\n{{Main|Subtitle}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n[[Subtitle (captioning)|Subtitles]] can be used instead of dubbing, as different countries have different traditions regarding the choice between dubbing and subtitling. On [[DVD]]s with higher translation budgets, the option for both types will often be provided to account for individual preferences; [[Purism|purists]] often demand subtitles. For small markets (small language area or films for a select audience), subtitling is more suitable, because it is cheaper. In the case of films for small children who cannot yet read, or do not read fast enough, dubbing is necessary.\n\nIn most [[English language|English]]-speaking countries, dubbing is comparatively rare. In [[Israel]], some programmes need to be comprehensible to speakers of both [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. This cannot be accomplished with dubbing, so subtitling is much more commonplace\u2014sometimes even with subtitles in multiple languages, with the soundtrack remaining in the original language, usually English. The same applies to certain television shows in [[Finland]], where [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] are both official languages.\n\nIn the [[Netherlands]], [[Flanders]], [[Nordic countries]], [[Estonia]] and [[Portugal]], films and television programmes are shown in the original language (usually English) with subtitles, and only cartoons and children's movies and programs are dubbed, such as the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Shrek]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' and others. Cinemas usually show both a dubbed version and one with subtitles for this kind of movie, with the subtitled version shown later in the evening.\n\nIn Portugal, one terrestrial channel, [[TVI (Portugal)|TVI]], dubbed U.S. series like ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' into [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref name=\"DCpt\">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sKswU7k_I |title=Dawson's Creek PT |last=Somnorte |date=6 December 2008 |via=YouTube}}</ref> RTP also transmitted ''[[Friends]]'' in a dubbed version, but it was poorly received and later re-aired in a subtitled version. Cartoons, on the other hand, are usually dubbed, sometimes by well-known actors, even on TV. Animated movies are usually released to the cinemas in both subtitled and dubbed versions.\n\nIn [[Argentina]] and [[Venezuela]], terrestrial channels air films and TV series in a dubbed version, as demanded by law. However, those same series can be seen on cable channels at more accessible time-slots in their subtitled version and usually before they are shown on open TV. In contrast, the series ''The Simpsons'' is aired in its Mexican Spanish-dubbed version both on terrestrial television and on the cable station Fox, which broadcasts the series for the area. Although the first season of the series appeared with subtitles, this was not continued for the following seasons.\n\n===Dubbing and subtitling===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nIn [[Bulgaria]], television series are dubbed, but most television channels use subtitles for action and drama movies. [[AXN]] uses subtitles for its series, but as of 2008 emphasises dubbing. Only [[Diema]] channels dub all programs. Movies in theaters, with the exception of films for children, use dubbing and subtitles. Dubbing of television programs is usually done using voiceovers, but usually, voices professional actors, while trying to give each character a different voice by using appropriate intonations. Dubbing with synchronised voices is rarely used, mostly for animated films. ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'' is a rare example of a feature film dubbed this way on [[BNT Channel 1]], though a subtitled version is currently shown on other channels.\n\n[[Walt Disney Television]]'s animated series (such as ''[[DuckTales]]'', ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'', and ''[[Timon & Pumbaa (TV series)|Timon & Pumbaa]]'') were only aired with synchronised Bulgarian voices on [[BNT Channel 1]] until 2005, but then the Disney shows were canceled. When airing of Disney series resumed on [[Nova Television (Bulgaria)|Nova Television]] and [[Jetix]] in 2008, voiceovers were used, but Disney animated-movie translations still use synchronised voices. Voiceover dubbing is not used in theatrical releases. The Bulgarian film industry law requires all children's films to be dubbed, not subtitled. [[Nova Television (Bulgaria)|Nova Television]] dubbed and aired the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' anime with synchronised voices. Now, the show is airing on Disney Channel, also in a synchronised form.\n\n[[Netflix]] provides both subtitles and dubbed audio with its foreign language shows, including Brazil's dystopian \u201c[[3%]]\u201d and the German thriller \"[[Dark (TV series)|Dark]]\". Viewer testing indicates that its audience is more likely to finish watching a series if they select to view it with dubbed audio rather than translated subtitles. Netflix now streams its foreign language content with dubbed audio as default in an effort to increase viewer retention.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/netflix-success-secrets-1202721847/|title=Netflix's Secrets to Success: Six Cell Towers, Dubbing and More|last=Roettgers|first=Janko|date=8 March 2018|work=Variety|access-date=7 November 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==General use==\nDubbing is also used in applications and genres other than traditional film, including video games, television, and pornographic films.\n\n===Video games===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nMany [[video game]]s originally produced in [[North America]], [[Japan]], and [[PAL]] countries are dubbed into foreign languages for release in areas such as [[Europe]] and [[Australia]], especially for video games that place a heavy emphasis on dialogue. Because characters' mouth movements can be part of the game's code, [[lip sync]] is sometimes achieved by re-coding the mouth movements to match the dialogue in the new language. The [[Source engine]] automatically generates lip-sync data, making it easier for games to be localised.\n\nTo achieve synchronisation when animations are intended only for the source language, localised content is mostly recorded using techniques borrowed from movie dubbing (such as rythmo band) or, when images are not available, localised dubbing is done using source audios as a reference. Sound-synch is a method where localised audios are recorded matching the length and internal pauses of the source content.<!-- What does this last sentence mean? -->\n\nFor the European version of a video game, the on-screen text of the game is available in various languages and, in many cases, the dialogue is dubbed into each respective language, as well.\n\nThe North American version of any game is always available in [[English language|English]], with translated text and dubbed dialogue, if necessary, in other languages, especially if the North American version of the game contains the same data as the European version. Several Japanese games, such as those in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', ''[[Dynasty Warriors]]'', and ''[[Soul (series)|Soul]]'' series, are released with both the original Japanese audio and the English dub included.\n\n===Television===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nDubbing is occasionally used on [[network television]] broadcasts of films that contain dialogue that the network executives or [[Censorship|censors]] have decided to replace. This is usually done to remove [[profanity]]. In most cases, the original actor does not perform this duty, but an actor with a similar voice reads the changes. The results are sometimes seamless, but, in many cases, the voice of the replacement actor sounds nothing like the original performer, which becomes particularly noticeable when extensive dialogue must be replaced. Also, often easy to notice, is the sudden absence of background sounds in the movie during the dubbed dialogue. Among the films considered notorious for using substitute actors that sound very different from their theatrical counterparts are the ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' and the ''[[Die Hard series|Die Hard]]'' film series, as shown on broadcasters such as [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]]. In the case of ''Smokey and the Bandit'', extensive dubbing was done for the first network airing on [[ABC Television]] in 1978, especially for [[Jackie Gleason]]'s character, [[Buford T. Justice]]. The dubbing of his phrase \"sombitch\" (son of a bitch) became \"scum bum,\" which became a catchphrase of the time.\n\nDubbing is commonly used in [[science fiction television]], as well. Sound generated by effects equipment such as [[Animatronics|animatronic]] puppets or by actors' movements on elaborate multi-level plywood sets (for example, starship bridges or other command centers) will quite often make the original character dialogue unusable. ''[[Stargate]]'' and ''[[Farscape]]'' are two prime examples where ADR is used heavily to produce usable audio.\n\nSince some anime series contain profanity, the studios recording the English dubs often re-record certain lines if a series or movie is going to be broadcast on [[Cartoon Network]], removing references to [[death]] and [[hell]] as well. Some companies will offer both an edited and an uncut version of the series on DVD, so that there is an edited script available in case the series is broadcast. Other companies also edit the full-length version of a series, meaning that even on the uncut DVD characters say things like \"Blast!\" and \"Darn!\" in place of the original dialogue's profanity. [[Bandai|Bandai Entertainment's]] English dub of ''[[G Gundam]]'' is infamous for this, among many other things, with such lines as \"Bartender, more milk\".\n\nDubbing has also been used for comedic purposes, replacing lines of dialogue to create comedies from footage that was originally another genre. Examples include the Australian shows ''[[The Late Show (1990s Australian TV series)#The Olden Days|The Olden Days]]'' and ''[[Bargearse]]'', re-dubbed from 1970s Australian drama and action series, respectively, the Irish show ''[[Soupy Norman]]'', re-dubbed from ''[[:pl:Pierwsza mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107|Pierwsza mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107]]'', a Polish soap opera, and ''[[Most Extreme Elimination Challenge]]'', a comedic dub of the Japanese show ''[[Takeshi's Castle]]''.\n\nDubbing into a foreign language does not always entail the deletion of the original language. In some countries, a performer may read the translated dialogue as a voice-over. This often occurs in [[Russia]] and [[Poland]], where \"lektories\" or \"lektors\" read the translated dialogue into [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Polish language|Polish]]. In Poland, one announcer read all text. However, this is done almost exclusively for the television and home video markets, while theatrical releases are usually subtitled. Recently, however, the number of high-quality, fully dubbed films has increased, especially for children's movies. If a quality dubbed version exists for a film, it is shown in theaters. However, some films, such as ''[[Harry Potter]]'' or ''[[Star Wars]]'', are shown in both dubbed and subtitled versions, varying with the time of the show. Such films are also shown on TV (although some channels drop them and do standard one-narrator translation) and VHS/DVD. In other countries, like [[Vietnam]], the voice-over technique is also used for theatrical releases.<!-- This section and the next one are redundant. This material has already been covered and should be merged above. -->\n\nIn Russia, the reading of all lines by a single person is referred to as a [[Gavrilov translation]], and is generally found only in [[Copyright infringement|illegal copies]] of films and on [[cable television]]. Professional copies always include at least two actors of opposite gender translating the dialogue. Some titles in Poland have been dubbed this way, too, but this method lacks public appeal, so it is very rare now.\n\nOn special occasions, such as [[film festival]]s, live [[interpreting]] is often done by professionals.\n\n===Pornography===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nAs budgets for [[pornographic film]]s are often small, compared to films made by major studios, and there is an inherent need to film without interrupting filming, it is common for sex scenes to be over-dubbed. The audio for such over-dubbing is generally referred to as ''the Ms and Gs'', or ''the moans and groans.''\n\n==Dubbing into varieties==\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2013}}\nIn the case of languages with large communities (such as [[English language|English]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], or [[French language|French]]), a single translation may sound foreign to native speakers in a given region. Therefore, a film may be translated into a certain variety of a certain language. For example, the animated movie ''[[The Incredibles]]'' was translated to [[European Spanish]], [[Mexican Spanish]], [[Neutral Spanish]] (which is Mexican Spanish but avoids colloquialisms), and [[Rioplatense Spanish]] (although people from [[Chile]] and [[Uruguay]] noticed a strong ''[[porte\u00f1o]]'' accent from most of the characters of the Rioplatense Spanish translation).{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} In [[List of countries where Spanish is an official language|Spanish-speaking regions]], most media is dubbed twice: into European Spanish and Neutral Spanish.\n\nAnother example is the French dubbing of ''The Simpsons'', which has two entirely different versions for [[Quebec]] and for [[France]]. The humor is very different for each audience (see [[Non-English versions of The Simpsons|Non-English versions of ''The Simpsons'']]). Audiences in Quebec are generally critical of France's dubbing of ''The Simpsons'', which they often do not find amusing.\n\n[[Quebec French|Quebec-French]] dubbing of films is generally made in accent-free [[Standard French]], but may sound peculiar to audiences in France because of the persistence of some regionally-neutral expressions and because Quebec-French performers pronounce Anglo-Saxon names with an American accent, unlike French performers. Occasionally, budget restraints cause American [[direct-to-video]] films, such as the 1995 film ''When the Bullet Hits the Bone'', to be released in France with a Quebec-French dubbing, sometimes resulting in what some members of French audiences perceive as unintentional humor.\n\n[[Portugal]] and [[Brazil]] also use different versions of dubbed films and series. Because dubbing has never been very popular in [[Portugal]], for decades, children's films were distributed using the higher-quality Brazilian dub (unlike children's TV series, which are traditionally dubbed in European Portuguese). Only in the 1990s did dubbing begin to gain popularity in Portugal. ''[[The Lion King]]'' became the first Disney feature film to be completely dubbed into [[European Portuguese]], and subsequently all major animation films gained European-Portuguese versions. In recent [[DVD]] releases, most Brazilian-Portuguese-dubbed classics were released with new European-Portuguese dubs, eliminating the predominance of Brazilian-Portuguese dubs in Portugal.\n\nSimilarly, in the [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking region of [[Flanders]], [[Belgium]], cartoons are often dubbed locally by [[Flemish]] artists{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} rather than using soundtracks produced in the [[Netherlands]].\n\nThe [[list of territorial entities where German is an official language|German-speaking region]], which includes [[Germany]], [[Austria]], part of [[Switzerland]], and [[Liechtenstein]], share a common German-dubbed version of films and shows. Although there are some differences in the three major German varieties, all films, shows, and series are dubbed into a single [[Standard German]] version that avoids regional variations in the German-speaking audience. Most voice actors are primarily German or Austrian. Switzerland, which has four official languages (German, French, [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Romansh language|Romansh]]), generally uses dubbed versions made in each respective country (except for Romansh). Liechtenstein uses German-dubbed versions only.\n\nSometimes, films are also dubbed into several [[German dialects]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} ([[Berlinerisch]], [[Colognian language|K\u00f6lsch]], [[Saxonian]], [[Austro-Bavarian language|Austro-Bavarian]] or [[Swiss German]]), especially animated films and Disney films. They are as an additional \"special feature\" to entice the audience into buying it. Popular animated films dubbed into German variety include ''[[Asterix]]'' films (in addition to its Standard German version, every film has a particular variety version), ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'',{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} ''[[Shrek 2]]'',{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', (+ Austrian German){{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} and ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OBS_20090810_OBS0008 |title=\u00d6sterreich-Version von Disney/Pixars \"Oben\" mit Otto Schenk und Karlheinz B\u00f6hm - BILD |language=de |publisher=ots.at |date=10 August 2009 |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref> (+ Austrian German).\n\nSome live-action films or TV-series have an additional German variety dubbing: ''[[Babe (film)|Babe]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Babe: Pig in the City]]'' (German German, Austrian German, Swiss German); and ''[[Rehearsal for Murder]]'', ''[[Framed (TV series)|Framed]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://215072.homepagemodules.de/topic-threaded.php?forum=11776730&threaded=1&id=506508&message=6643629 |title=Allgemeines \" ORF-Synchronisationen - Wer wei\u00df was? |publisher=215072.homepagemodules.de |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref> (+ Austrian German); ''[[The Munsters]]'', ''[[Serpico]]'', ''[[Rumpole]]'' (+ Austrian German), and ''[[The Thorn Birds]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://215072.homepagemodules.de/topic-threaded.php?forum=11776728&threaded=1&id=506269&message=7100872 |title=Serien \" 24 |publisher=215072.homepagemodules.de |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref>\n(only Austrian German dubbing).\n\nBefore [[German reunification]], [[East Germany]] also made its own particular German version. For example, ''[[Olsen-banden|Olsen Gang]]'' and the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] animated series ''[[The M\u00e9zga Family]]'' were dubbed in [[West Germany]] as well as East Germany.\n\nUsually, there are two dubbings produced in [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]: [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. Serbian for [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]; Croatian for [[Croatia]] and parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n==Criticism==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}\n\nWhile the voice actors involved usually bear the brunt of criticisms towards poor dubbing, other factors may include inaccurate script translation and poor [[Audio mixing (television and film)|audio mixing]]. Dialogue typically contains speech patterns and sentence structure that are natural to the original language but would appear awkward if translated literally. English dubs of Japanese animation, for example, must rewrite the dialogue so that it flows smoothly while following the natural pattern of English speech. On some occasions, voice actors record their dialogue individually instead of with the rest of the cast, and their performances can lack the dynamics gained from performing as a group.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nMany [[martial arts]] movies from [[Hong Kong]] that were imported under the unofficial banner [[Kung Fu Theater]] were notorious{{according to whom|date=June 2019}} for seemingly careless dubbing that included poor lip sync and awkward dialogue. Since the results were frequently unintentionally humorous, it has become one of the hallmarks that endear these films to fans of the 1980s culture.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{commons category|Dubbing (filmmaking)}}\n*{{Cite book |last1=Maluf |first1=Ramez |title=Dubbing into Arabic: A Trojan Horse at the Gates? |url=http://inhouse.lau.edu.lb/bima/papers/Dubbing.pdf |accessdate=10 April 2011 |date=19 December 2003 |publisher=[[Lebanese American University]]}}\n*Di Fortunato E. e Paolinelli M.

The insertion of [[voice acting|voice actor]] performances for [[animation]], such as [[computer generated imagery]] or [[animated cartoon]]s, is often referred to as ADR although it generally does not replace existing dialogue.\n\nThe ADR process may be used to: \n\n:*remove extraneous sounds such as production equipment noise, traffic, wind, or other undesirable sounds from the environment\n:*change the original lines recorded on set to clarify context \n:*improve [[diction]] or modify an [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]\n:*improve [[comic timing|comedic timing]] or dramatic timing\n:*correct technical issues with [[synchronization|synchronisation]]\n:*use a studio-quality singing performance or provide a voice-double for actors who are poor vocalists\n:*add or remove content for legal purposes (such as removing an unauthorised trademarked name)\n:*add or remove a product placement\n:*correct a misspoken line not caught during filming.\n:*replace foul language for TV broadcasts of a movie or other program\nIn conventional film production, a [[production sound mixer]] records dialogue during filming. During post-production, a supervising [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound editor]], or ADR supervisor, reviews all of the dialogue in the film and decides which lines must be re-recorded. ADR is recorded during an ADR session, which takes place in a specialised [[Recording studio|sound studio]]. The actor, usually the original actor from the set, views the scene with the original sound, then attempts to recreate the performance. Over the course of multiple [[take]]s, the actor performs the lines while watching the scene; the most suitable take becomes the final version.<ref>{{cite web |title=ADR |publisher=FilmSound.org |url=http://filmsound.org/terminology/adr.htm |accessdate=6 November 2016}}</ref> The ADR process does not always take place in a post-production studio. The process may be recorded on location, with mobile equipment. ADR can also be recorded without showing the actor the image they must match, but by having them listen to the performance, since some actors{{who|date=June 2019}} believe that watching themselves act can degrade subsequent performances.\n\nSometimes, an actor other than the original actor is used during ADR. One famous example is the ''[[Star Wars]]'' character [[Darth Vader]], portrayed by [[David Prowse]]; in post-production, [[James Earl Jones]] dubbed the voice of Vader.<ref>{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |title=Film: Lucas Returns with 'The Jedi' |date=25 May 1983 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9c00e3d71e38f936a15756c0a965948260 |accessdate=6 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nOther examples include:\n*[[Jean Hagen]] provided [[Debbie Reynolds]]' voice in two scenes of ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952). Ironically, the film's story has Reynolds' character, Kathy Seldon, dubbing the voice for ''Hagen's'' character, Lina Lamont, due to Lina's grating voice and strong New York accent. Hagen used her own normal melodious voice to portray Kathy dubbing for Lina. The film, which takes place in Hollywood as talking pictures are taking over from silent films, also portrays another character, Cosmo Brown, played by [[Donald O'Connor]], as inventing the idea of using one actor to provide the voice for another.\n*[[Marni Nixon]] provided the singing voice for the character [[Eliza Doolittle]], otherwise played by [[Audrey Hepburn]], in the 1964 musical film ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]''. Nixon was also the singing voices for [[Deborah Kerr]] in ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'' and [[Natalie Wood]] in ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'', among many others.\n*[[Ray Park]], who acted as [[Darth Maul]] from ''[[Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace]]'' had his voice dubbed over by [[Peter Serafinowicz]]\n*Frenchmen [[Philippe Noiret]] and [[Jacques Perrin]], who were dubbed into Italian for ''[[Cinema Paradiso]]''\n*Austrian bodybuilder [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], dubbed for ''[[Hercules in New York]]''\n*Argentine boxer [[Carlos Monz\u00f3n]], dubbed by a professional actor for the lead in the drama ''[[La Mary]]''\n*[[Gert Frobe]], who played Auric Goldfinger in the James Bond film [[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]], dubbed by Michael Collins\n*[[Andie MacDowell]]'s Jane, in ''[[Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes]]'', who was dubbed by [[Glenn Close]]\n*[[Tom Hardy]], who portrayed [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] in ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'', re-dubbed half of his own lines for ease of viewer comprehension\n*[[Harvey Keitel]] was dubbed by [[Roy Dotrice]] in post production for ''[[Saturn 3]]\n*[[Dave Coulier]] dubbed replacement of swear words for [[Richard Pryor]] in multiple TV versions of his movies\n\n===Process===\nThe tasks involved are performed by three different agents{{clarify|What are agents, and what are the three kinds of agents?|date=June 2019}} in the dubbing process: \n# translation \n# take segmentation \n# insertion of dubbing symbols \n# lip-sync \n# dialogue writing and the emulation of natural discourse\n\nSometimes the translator performs all five tasks. In other cases, the translator just submits a rough translation and a dialogue writer does the rest.\n\n====Dialog writing====\n\nThe dialogue writer\u2019s role is to make the translation sound natural of the target language, and to make the translation sound like a credible dialogue instead of merely a translated text.<ref>Chaume, F. (2013). Research paths in audiovisual translation: The case of dubbing. In The Routledge handbook of translation studies (pp. \n306-320). Routledge.</ref>\n\nAnother task of dialogue writers is to check whether a translation matches an on-screen character\u2019s mouth movements or not, by reading aloud simultaneously with the character. The dialogue writer often stays in the recording setting with the actors or the voice talents, to ensure that the dialogue is being spoken in the way that it was written to be, and to avoid any ambiguity in the way the dialogue is to be read (focusing on emphasis, intonation, pronunciation, articulation, pronouncing foreign words correctly, etc.). The overall goal is to make sure the script creates the illusion of authenticity of the spoken language.\n\n====Rythmo band====\nAn alternative method to dubbing, called \"rythmo band\" (or \"[[Lip sync|lip-sync]] band\"), has historically been used in [[Canada]] and [[France]].{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} It provides a more precise guide{{explain|how is it more precise? What's the difference?|date=June 2019}} for the actors, [[Film director|directors]], and technicians, and can be used to complement the traditional ADR method. The \"band\" is actually a clear 35&nbsp;mm [[film leader]] on which the dialogue is hand-written in [[India ink]], together with numerous additional indications for the actor\u2014including laughs, cries, length of syllables, mouth sounds, breaths, and mouth openings and closings. The rythmo band is projected in the studio and scrolls in perfect synchronisation with the picture.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nStudio time is used more efficiently, since with the aid of scrolling text, picture, and audio cues, actors can read more lines per hour than with ADR alone (only picture and audio). With ADR, actors can average 10\u201312 lines per hour, while rythmo band can facilitate the reading of 35-50 lines per hour.<ref>{{cite web |title=U of U Sound Final |url=http://quizlet.com/8640541/u-of-u-sound-final-flash-cards/ |work=Quizlet |publisher=Quizlet LLC |accessdate=30 July 2012 |author=Quizlet |year=2012}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the preparation of a rythmo band is a time-consuming process involving a series of specialists organised in a production line. This has prevented the technique from being more widely adopted, but software emulations of rythmo band technology overcome the disadvantages of the traditional rythmo band process and significantly reduce the time needed to prepare a dubbing session.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}o\n\n==<span id=\"Practice of dubbing foreign films throughout the world\"></span> Global use==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}\n\n===Dub localization===\nDub localization, also often simply referred to as [[Language localization|localization]], is the practice of [[voice-over translation]] that alters a [[film]] or [[television series]] from one region of the world to the local language of another.\n\nThe new voice track is usually spoken by a [[voice actor]]. In many countries, actors who regularly perform this duty remain little-known, with the exception of particular circles (such as anime [[fandom]]) or when their voices have become synonymous with roles or actors whose voices they usually dub. In the United States, many of these voice artists may employ pseudonyms or go uncredited due to [[Screen Actors Guild]] regulations or the desire to dissociate themselves from the role.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nDub localisation is a contentious issue in [[cinephilia]] amongst aficionados of foreign [[filmmaking]] and [[television program]]s, particularly [[anime]] fans. While some localisation is virtually inevitable in translation, the controversy surrounding how much localisation is \"too much\" is often discussed in such communities, especially when the final dub product is significantly different from the original. Some fans frown on any extensive localisation, while others expect it, and to varying degrees, appreciate it.\n\n===Europe===\n[[File:Dubbing films in Europe.png|thumb|300px|{{legend|#0000FF|Dubbing only for children: Otherwise solely subtitles.}}\n{{legend|#FF0000|General dubbing: Countries using a full-cast dubbing.}}\n{{legend|#FFFF00|Voice-over: Countries using a couple or just one voice actor, whereas the original soundtrack persists.

For movies in cinemas with clear target audiences (both below and above 10\u201311 years of age), both a dubbed and a subtitled version are usually available.\n\n=====Albania=====\nThe first movie dubbed in [[Albanian language]] was ''[[The Great Warrior Skanderbeg]]'' in 1954 and since then, there have been thousands of popular titles dubbed in Albanian by different dubbing studios. All animated movies and children's programs are dubbed into Albanian language, many live-action movies as well. TV series nevertheless are usually not dubbed, they are subtitled except for a few [[Mexico|Mexican]], [[Brazil]]ian and [[Turkey|Turkish]] soap operas, like: ''[[Por ti (telenovela)|Por Ti]]'', ''[[Celebridade]]'', ''[[A Casa das Sete Mulheres]]'', ''[[Parampar\u00e7a (TV series)|Parampar\u00e7a]]'', etc. As for documentaries, Albania usually uses voice-over.\n\n=====Belgium=====\nIn the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium ([[Flanders]]), movies and TV series are shown in their original language with [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], with the exception of most movies made for a young audience. In the latter case, sometimes separate versions are recorded in the [[Netherlands]] and in [[Flanders]] (for instance, several [[List of Disney theatrical animated features|Walt Disney films]] and [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]]). These dubbed versions only differ from each other in their use of different voice actors and different pronunciation, while the text is almost the same.\n\nIn the French-speaking part of Belgium ([[Wallonia]]), the range of French-dubbed versions is approximately as wide as the [[German language|German]] range, where nearly all movies and TV series are dubbed.\n\n=====Bosnia and Herzegovina=====\n[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] usually uses [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] dubs, but they have dubbed some cartoons in [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] by themselves, for example ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]''. Children's programs (both animated and live-action) are airing dubbed (in Serbian, Croatian or Bosnian), while every other program is subtitled (in Bosnian).\n\n=====Croatia=====\nIn [[Croatia]], foreign films and TV series are always subtitled, while most children's programs and animated movies are dubbed into [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. The practice of dubbing began in the 1980s in some animated shows and continued in 90's, 00's and forward in other shows and films, the latter ones being released in home media. Recently, more efforts have been made to introduce dubbing, but public reception has been poor in some exceptions. Regardless of language, Croatian audiences prefer subtitling to dubbing, however it is still popular in animated films. Some previously popular shows (such as ''[[Sailor Moon]]'') lost their appeal completely after the practice of dubbing began, and the dubbing was eventually removed from the programs, even though most animated shows shown on television and some on home media have been well received by people watching dubbed versions of them. This situation is similar with theater movies, with only those intended for children being dubbed (such as ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' and ''[[Shark Tale]]''), but nowadays are shown in dubbed versions. Also, there has been an effort to impose dubbing by [[Nova TV (Croatia)|Nova TV]], with ''[[La Fea M\u00e1s Bella]]'' translated as ''Ru\u017ena ljepotica'' (literally, \"The Ugly Beauty\"), a Mexican telenovela, but it failed. Some of [[Croatian language|Croatian]] dubbing is also broadcast in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].\n\n=====Estonia=====\nIn [[Estonia]] in cinemas, only children's animated films are dubbed and live-action films are shown in the original English and Russian languages with subtitles at cinemas. Subtitles are usually presented in both Estonian and [[Russian language]]s. Cartoons and animated series voiced by dubbing or [[Voice-over|voiceover]] and live-action films and television series only with Estonian subtitles also but with English and Russian Dub Languages. Animated films are commonly shown in both the originals and Russian languages and dubbed into Estonian (or Russian in many cinemas). Most Estonian-language television channels use subtitles English and Russian Audio for foreign-language films and TV channels. However, Russian language channels tend to use dubbing more often, especially for Russian channels broadcast from [[Russia]] (as opposed to Russian channels broadcast from Estonia).\n\n=====Greece=====\nIn [[Greece]], most cartoon films have dubs. Usually when a movie has a Greek dub the dub is shown in cinemas but subtitled versions are shown as well. Foreign TV shows for adults are shown in their original versions with subtitles, most cartoons, for example, ''[[The Flintstones]]'' and ''[[The Jetsons]]'' were always dubbed, while ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[American Dad!]]'' are always subtitled and contain the original English dialogue, since they are mostly for adults rather than children, (even though the movie ''[[Space Jam]]'' was subtitled instead of being dubbed, since also this is suitable for children). Also some Japanese anime series are dubbed in Greek (such as Pok\u00e9mon, Pichi Pichi Pitch, Sailor Moon etc.) The only television programs dubbed in Greek includes [[Mexico|Mexican]] TV series (like ''[[Rub\u00ed (2004 telenovela)|Rub\u00ed]]'' and ''[[La usurpadora (Mexican TV series)|La usurpadora]]'') and teen series (like ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' and ''[[The Suite Life of Zack & Cody]]''). However, when [[Skai TV]] was re-launched in April 2006, the network opted for dubbing almost all foreign shows in Greek, unlike other Greek channels which had always broadcast most of the programs in their original language with subtitles.\n\n=====Ireland=====\nIreland usually receives the same film versions as the UK. However some films have been dubbed into [[Irish language|Irish]] by [[TG4]], including the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=bY4JK5PR4MAC&lpg=PA275&ots=D6dkX7Up-y&dq=Harry%20Potter%20TG4&pg=PA275#v=onepage&q&f=true ''Writing and Translating for Children''], Elena Di Giovanni, Chiara Elefante, Roberta Pederzoli, Peter Lang, 2010, page 259</ref>\n\n=====Netherlands=====\nIn the [[Netherlands]], for the most part, Dutch versions are only made for children's and family films. Animated movies are shown in theaters with Dutch dubbing, but usually those cinemas with more screening rooms also provide the original subtitled version, such as movies like ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' and ''[[WALL-E]]''.\n\n=====North Macedonia=====\n[[North Macedonia]] dubbed many cartoons in [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], but they also air some [[Serbian language|Serbian]] dubs. Children's programs are airing dubbed (in Macedonian or Serbian), while every other program is subtitled (in Macedonian). They use [[Serbian language|Serbian]] dubs for [[Disney]] movies, because there are no [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] [[Disney]] dubs.\n\n=====Poland=====\n{{essay|section|date=October 2016}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nIn [[Poland]], cinema releases for general audiences are almost exclusively subtitled, with the exception of children's movies, and television screenings of movies, as well as made-for-TV shows. These are usually shown with voice-over, where a voice talent reads a translation over the original soundtrack. This method, called \"juxtareading,\" is similar to the so-called [[Gavrilov translation]] in Russia, with one difference\u2014all dialogues are voiced by one off-screen reader ({{lang-pl|lektor}}), preferably with a deep and neutral voice which does not interfere with the pitch of voice of the original speakers in the background. To some extent, it resembles live translation. Certain highly qualified voice talents are traditionally assigned to particular kinds of production, such as action or drama. Standard dubbing is not widely popular with most audiences, with the exception of cartoons and children's shows, which are dubbed also for TV releases.\n\nIt is claimed that, until around 1951, there were no revoiced foreign movies available in Poland. Instead, they were exclusively subtitled in Polish.<ref>{{cite book|title=Das kulturelle Leben der Deutschen in Niederschlesien unter polnischer Verwaltung. 1947-1958|first=Bernhard|last=Grund|publisher=Bundesministerium f\u00fcr gesamtdeutsche Fragen|place=Bonn und Berlin|date=1967|series=Bonner Berichte aus Mittel- und Ostdeutschland|page=119}}</ref>\n\nPoland's dubbing traditions began between the two world wars. In 1931, among the first movies dubbed into Polish were ''[[Dangerous Curves (1929 film)|Dangerous Curves]]'' (1929), ''[[The Dance of Life]]'' (1929), ''[[Paramount on Parade]]'' (1930), and ''[[Darling of the Gods]]'' (1930). In 1949, the first dubbing studio opened in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]. The first film dubbed that year was ''Russkiy Vopros'' (filmed 1948).\n\nPolish dubbing in the first post-war years suffered from poor synchronisation. Polish dialogues were not always audible and the cinema equipment of that time often made films sound less clear than they were. In the 1950s, Polish publicists discussed the quality of Polish versions of foreign movies.\n\nThe number of dubbed movies and the quality improved. Polish dubbing had a golden age between the 1960s and the 1980s. Approximately a third of foreign movies screened in cinemas were dubbed. The \"Polish dubbing school\" was known for its high quality. In that time, Poland had some of the best dubbing in the world. The person who initiated high-quality dubbing versions was director Zofia Dybowska-Aleksandrowicz. In that time, dubbing in Poland was very popular. Polish television dubbed popular films and TV series such as ''[[Rich Man, Poor Man (miniseries)|Rich Man, Poor Man]]''; ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', ''[[Forsyte Saga]]'', ''[[Elizabeth R]]'', ''[[I, Claudius]]'', ''[[I'll Take Manhattan (miniseries)|I'll Take Manhattan]]'', and ''[[Peter the Great (TV series)|Peter the Great]]''.\n\nIn the 1980s, due to budget cuts, state-run TV saved on tapes by voicing films over live during transmission.\n\nOverall, during 1948-1998, almost 1,000 films were dubbed in Polish. In the 1990s, dubbing films and TV series continued, although often also for one emission only.\n\nIn 1995, [[Canal+]] was launched in Poland. In its first years, it dubbed 30% of its schedule dubbing popular films and TV series, one of the best-known and popular dubbings was that of ''[[Friends (TV series)|Friends]]'', but this proved unsuccessful.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20151222233455/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119215016517556740 On Polish TV, Desperate Wives Sound Like Guys], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', 12 October 2007</ref> It stopped dubbing films in 1999, although many people supported the idea of dubbing and bought the access only for dubbing versions of foreign productions. In the 1990s, dubbing was done by the television channel known as [[Wizja Jeden]]. They mainly dubbed [[BBC]] productions such as ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]'', ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'' and ''[[Men Behaving Badly]]''. Wizja Jeden was closed in 2001. In the same year, TVP stopped dubbing the TV series ''[[Frasier]]'', although that dubbing was very popular.\n\nCurrently, dubbing of films and TV series for teenagers is made by Nickelodeon and Disney Channel. One of the major breakthroughs in dubbing was the Polish release of ''Shrek'', which contained many references to local culture and Polish humour. Since then, people seem to have grown to like dubbed versions more, and pay more attention to the dubbing actors.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} However, this seems to be the case only with animated films, as live-action dubbing is still considered a bad practice. In the case of [[DVD|DVD releases]], most discs contain both the original soundtrack and subtitles, and either voice over or dubbed Polish track. The dubbed version is, in most cases, the one from the theater release, while voice-over is provided for movies that were only subtitled in theaters.\n\nSince theatrical release of ''The Avengers'' in May 2012, Walt Disney Company Polska dubs all films for cinema releases. Also in 2012, [[United International Pictures]] Polska dubbed ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', while Forum Film Polska \u2013 former distributor of Disney's films \u2013 decided to dub ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'', along with its [[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug|two]] [[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|sequels]]. However, when a dub is produced but the film's target audience is not exclusively children, both dubbed and subtitled versions are usually available in movie theaters. The dubbed versions are more commonly shown in morning and early afternoon hours, with the subtitled version dominating in the evening. Both can be available in parallel at similar hours in multiplexes.\n\n=====Portugal=====\nIn [[Portugal]], dubbing was banned under a 1948 law as a way of protecting the domestic film industry and reduce the access to culture as most of the population was illiterate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amordeperdicao.pt/especiais_solo.asp?artigoid=206 |title=amor de perdi\u00e7\u00e3o - especiais |date=21 January 2005 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050121055806/http://www.amordeperdicao.pt/especiais_solo.asp?artigoid=206 |archivedate=21 January 2005  }}</ref> Until 1994, animated movies, as well as other TV series for children shown in Portugal, have imported [[Brazilian Portuguese]] dubs due to the lack of interest from Portuguese companies in the dubbing industry. This lack of interest was justified, since there were already quality dubbed copies of shows and movies in Portuguese made by [[Brazil]]ians. ''[[The Lion King]]'' was the first feature film to be dubbed in [[European Portuguese]] rather than strictly Brazilian Portuguese. Currently, all movies for children are dubbed in European Portuguese. Subtitles are preferred in Portugal,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jornaleconomico.sapo.pt/noticias/polemica-dobragem-serie-einstein-gera-criticas-axn-118969|title=Pol\u00e9mica: dobragem da s\u00e9rie 'Einstein' gera cr\u00edticas ao AXN|access-date=29 March 2017|date=3 February 2017|work=O Jornal Econ\u00f3mico|quote=Ao contr\u00e1rio de alguns mercados como o espanhol e brasileiro, o p\u00fablico portugu\u00eas n\u00e3o se mostra recetivo a esta op\u00e7\u00e3o.|language=portuguese}}</ref> used in every foreign-language [[Documentary film|documentary]], TV series and film. The exception to this preference is when children are the target audience.\n\nWhile on TV, children's shows and movies are always dubbed, in cinemas, films with a clear juvenile target can be found in two versions, one dubbed (identified by the letters V.P. for ''vers\u00e3o portuguesa'' - \"Portuguese version\") and another subtitled version (V.O. for ''vers\u00e3o original'' - \"original version\"). This duality applies only to juvenile films. Others use subtitles only. While the quality of these dubs is recognised (some have already received international recognition and prizes), original versions with subtitles are usually preferred by the adults (''[[Bee Movie]]'', for example). Dubbing cartoons aimed at adults (such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'' or ''[[South Park]]'') is less common. When ''The Simpsons Movie'' debuted in Portugal, most cinemas showed both versions (V.O. and V.P.), but in some small cities, cinemas decided to offer only the Portuguese version, a decision that led to public protest. Presently, [[live action]] series and movies are always shown in their original language format with Portuguese subtitles. Television programs for young children (such as ''[[Power Rangers]]'', ''[[Goosebumps (TV series)|Goosebumps]]'', ''[[Big Bad Beetleborgs]]'', etc.) are dubbed into European Portuguese. Some video games aimed at adults (such as [[God of War III]], [[Halo 3]], [[Assassin's Creed III]] and [[inFamous 2]]) are dubbed in European Portuguese, although there they provide an option to select the original language.\n\n=====Romania=====\n<!-- Please do not change this section to Hungarian, because graph QA11 of the Eurobarometer lists the number 62 next to RO (Romania). Hungary is HU.-->\nIn [[Romania]], virtually all programmes intended for children are dubbed in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], including cartoons, live-action movies and TV series on [[Disney Channel Romania|Disney Channel]], [[Cartoon Network (Europe)|Cartoon Network]], [[Minimax tv|Minimax]], and [[Nickelodeon]], as well as those shown on general television networks, children-focused series (such as ''[[Power Rangers]]'', ''[[Goosebumps (TV series)|Goosebumps]]'', ''[[The New Addams Family]]'', ''[[The Planet's Funniest Animals]]'') or movies screened on children's television. Animated movies are shown in theaters with Romanian dubbing. However, those cinemas with more screening rooms usually also provide the original subtitled version. Such was the case for movies like ''[[Babe (movie)|Babe]]'', ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Cars (movie)|Cars]]'', ''[[Shrek the Third]]'', ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'', ''[[Kung Fu Panda]]'' and ''[[WALL-E]]''. Other foreign TV shows and movies are shown in the original language with Romanian subtitles. Subtitles are usually preferred in the Romanian market. According to \"Special Eurobarometer 243\" (graph QA11.8) of the [[European Commission]] (research carried out in November and December 2005), 62% of Romanians prefer to watch foreign films and programmes with subtitles (rather than dubbed), 22% prefer dubbing, and 16% declined to answer.<ref name=\"eurobarometer\">[http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf Special Eurobarometer 243] of the European Commission with the title \"Europeans and their Languages\", published in February 2006 with research carried out in November and December 2005. Barely 2% of Romanians consider watching original-language versions most effective into learning a new language (Table QA7b).</ref> This is led by the assumption that watching movies in their original versions is very useful for learning foreign languages. However, according to the same Eurobarometer, virtually no Romanian found this method\u2014watching movies in their original version\u2014to be the most efficient way to learn foreign languages, compared to 53 percent who preferred language lessons at school.<ref name=\"eurobarometer\" />\n\nIn Romania, foreign language television programs and films are generally subtitled rather than dubbed.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=csMetRFKXmgC&lpg=PT61&dq=romania%20dubbing%20tv&pg=PT61#v=onepage&q=romania%20dubbing%20tv&f=true ''Dracula is Dead: How Romanians Survived Communism, Ended It, and Emerged Since 1989 as the New Italy''], Sheilah Kast, Jim Rosapepe, 2009, page 49</ref> This includes programs in non-Western languages, such as [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Korean language|Korean]] or [[Hindi language|Hindi]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=aXutBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA91&dq=romania+subtitles+television&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiI-s2aysvOAhXrAMAKHXs4Ca4Q6AEIPDAF#v=onepage&q=romania%20subtitles%20television&f=true ''The Global Impact of South Korean Popular Culture: Hallyu Unbound''], Valentina Marinescu, Lexington Books, 2014, page 91</ref>\n\n=====Serbia=====\n[[Serbian language]] dubs are made mainly for [[Serbia]], but they broadcast in [[Montenegro]] and [[Bosnia & Herzegovina]], too. Children's animated and some live-action movies and TV series are dubbed into Serbian, while live-action films and TV series for adults are always airing subtitled, because in this region people prefer subtitling for live-action formats. [[Turkey|Turkish]] soap opera ''[[Lale Devri]]'' started airing dubbed in 2011, on [[RTV Pink]], but because of bad reception, dub failed and rest of TV series was aired subtitled. ''[[Married... with Children]]'' was dubbed, too.\n\nThe dubbing of cartoon series in former [[Yugoslavia]] during the 1980s had a twist of its own: famous [[Serbia]]n actors, such as [[Nikola Simi\u0107 (actor)|Nikola Simi\u0107]], [[Mi\u0107a Tati\u0107]], [[Nada Blam]] and others provided the voices for characters of [[Disney]], [[Warner Bros.]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] and other companies, frequently using region-specific phrases and sentences and, thus, adding a dose of local humor to the translation of the original lines. These phrases became immensely popular and are still being used for [[tongue-in-cheek]] comments in specific situations. These dubs are today considered cult dubs. The only dub made after 1980s and 1990s ones that's considered cult is ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' dub, made by [[B92]] in period 2002-2017, because of a great popularity and memorable translation with local humor phrases, such as 1980s dubs translation.\n\nSome Serbian dubs are also broadcast in [[North Macedonia]], while cult dubs made during [[Yugoslavia]] were aired all over the country (today's [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]], [[Slovenia]], [[North Macedonia]] and [[Serbia]]).\n\n=====Slovenia=====\nIn [[Slovenia]], all foreign films and television programs are subtitled with the exception of children's movies and TV shows (both animated or live-action). While dubbed versions are always shown in cinemas and later on TV channels, cinemas will sometimes play subtitled versions of children's movies as well.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n=====United Kingdom=====\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the vast majority of foreign language films are subtitled, although mostly animated films are dubbed in English.  These usually originate from [[North America]], as opposed to being dubbed locally. Foreign language serials shown on BBC Four are subtitled into English (although open subtitles are dropped during dialogues with English language segments already).  There have, however, been notable examples of films and TV programmes successfully dubbed in the UK, such as the Japanese ''[[Monkey (TV series)|Monkey]]'' and French ''[[The Magic Roundabout|Magic Roundabout]]'' series.  When airing films on television, channels in the UK often choose subtitling over dubbing, even if a dubbing in English exists. It is also a fairly common practice for animation aimed at [[Preschool education|preschool]] children to be re-dubbed with British voice actors replacing the original voices, such as Spin Master Entertainment's [[PAW Patrol|Paw Patrol]] series, although this is not done with shows aimed at older audiences.  The off-screen narrated portions of some programmes and reality shows that originate from North America are also redone with British English voices.  \n\nSome animated films and TV programmes are also dubbed into [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]].\n\n[[Hinterland (TV series)|Hinterland]] displays a not so common example of a bilingual production. Each scene is filmed twice, in the English and Welsh languages, apart from a few scenes where Welsh with subtitles is used for the English version.<ref>{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jul/30/hinterland-tv-noir-wales |title=Hinterland \u2013 the TV noir so good they made it twice |first=Stephen |last=Moss |date=30 July 2013 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=[[London]] |access-date=5 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n=====Nordic countries=====\nIn the [[Nordic countries]], dubbing is used only in animated features (except [[adult animated]] features) and other films for younger audiences. Some cinemas in the major cities may also screen the original version, usually as the last showing of the day, or in a smaller auditorium in a [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]].\n\nIn television programs with off-screen narration, both the original audio and on-screen voices are usually subtitled in their native languages.\n\nThe Nordic countries are often treated as a common market issuing [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] releases with original audio and user choosable subtitle options in [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. The covers often have text in all four languages as well, but are sometimes unique for each country. Some releases may include other European language audio and/or subtitles (i.e. German, Greek, Hungarian or Italian). Children's films typically have Nordic audio tracks in all four languages, as well as original audio in most cases.\n\nIn [[Finland]], the dubbed version from [[Sweden]] may also be available at certain cinemas for children of the 5% Swedish-speaking minority, but only in cities or towns with a significant percentage of Swedish speakers. Most [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] releases usually only have the original audio, except for children's films, which have both Finnish and Swedish language tracks, in addition to the original audio and subtitles in both languages.\n\nIn Finnish movie theaters, films for adult audiences have both Finnish and Swedish subtitles, the Finnish printed in basic font and the Swedish printed below the Finnish in a cursive font. In the early ages of television, foreign TV shows and movies were voiced by narrator in Finland. Later, subtitles became a practice on Finnish television. Dubbing of films other than children's films is unpopular in Finland, as in many other countries. A good example is ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]''. While the original version was well-received, the Finnish-dubbed version received poor reviews, with some critics even calling it a disaster.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} On the other hand, many dubs of [[Disney]] animated features have been well-received, both critically and by the public.\n\nIn [[Iceland]], the dubbed version of film and TV is usually [[Danish language|Danish]] with some translated into [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]. [[LazyTown]], an Icelandic TV show originally broadcast in English, was dubbed into Icelandic, amongst thirty-two other languages, and it remains the TV show to have been dubbed into the most languages.\n\n====General films and programming====\nIn the [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[German language|German]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] language-speaking markets of [[Europe]], almost all foreign films and television shows are dubbed (the exception being the majority of theatrical releases of adult-audience movies in the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Poland]] and [[Turkey]] and high-profile videos in Russia). There are few opportunities to watch foreign movies in their original versions. In [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]] and [[Austria]], even in the largest cities, there are few cinemas that screen original versions with [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], or without any translation. However, digital [[pay-TV]] programming is often available in the original language, including the latest movies. Prior to the rise of DVDs, which in these countries are mostly issued with multi-language audio tracks, original-language films (those in languages other than the country's official language) were rare, whether in theaters, on TV, or on home video, and subtitled versions were considered a product for small [[niche market]]s such as intellectual or [[art film]]s.\n\n\n\n\n=====France=====\nIn [[France]], movies and TV series are, except purely arthouse films, usually released in the dubbed French language version. The original language version of the film with French subtitles is released in designated theaters which show only subtitled versions or both versions are shown at different times or split screenings between both versions. However, dubbing is the norm and subtitling is only for niche audience and movies with subtitles are usually very small arthouse films with very limited commercial prospects for pay and free TV airings and also home entertainment (VOD, DVD). Dubbing in the French Language is thus absolutely essential for any sale to be made.\n\nSince the digitalization of over-the-air television broadcasters, both versions have been offered to the customer simultaneously.  By default, foreign films and TV programmes shown on television are dubbed into French on a channel's main audio feed. However, with the advent of digital television, viewers can access the original language feed for some programmes, as well as matching subtitles.  In addition, the TV network ARTE has a French language track on its main audio feed as well as a German language track.  \n \nMost movies are released nationwide in dubbed version and subtitled versions where available with the exception of very limited often micro-budget arthouse productions that do stem come from the \"hollywood movie production\" machine which are exclusively arthouse films and not dubbed at the time of their theatrical release.\n\nTheaters showing these kind of movies or also showing commercial films in the original language version with French subtitles are very rare outside of the big cities and most of them are located in [[Paris]] which has the most \"cinephile\" cinemas in France. Often these \"niche\" films are only released in [[Paris]] region.\n\nA theater showing subtitled versions of original language movies are typically well known for this and will advertise this also on the poster advising moviegoers that the film is shown in an original language version (usually abbreviated VO [''version originale''] or VOST [''version originale sous-titr\u00e9e'']), as opposed to VF [''version fran\u00e7aise''], the latter then becoming what is known and used also in the neighboring countries like Belgium or Switzerland, as the \"FRENCH LANGUAGE VERSION\" of the film.)\n\nBecause the alterations made to the original film are so profound, making it no longer viewable or understandable for audiences that speak the language the film was originally shot in, the final dubbed version is called the \"French language version\", as opposed to the use of subtitles which leave the film in its original state.\nThe choice to dub or not at the time of theatrical release is a decision made by the distributor releasing the film based upon their recoupment strategy for the film and their prognosis of the commercial prospects. Given the fact that a dub is needed for home entertainment and TV sales, only very small arthouse films are never dubbed.\nOnly a very small percentage (according to the official institute CNC in France only 16.4% of all ticket-sales were for movies watched in the original language version with subtitles) and this is counting Blockbusters and others shown in their original language version with subtitles and the small number of films that are never dubbed.\nVoice actors that have dubbed for celebrities in the European French language can be viewed here.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Macy]]<br />[[Joe Pantoliano]] ||\n|}\n\n=====Italy=====\nIn [[Italy]], dubbing is systematic, with a tradition going back to the 1930s in [[Rome]], [[Milan]], [[Florence]] and [[Turin]]. In [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's]] fascist Italy, release of movies in foreign languages was banned for political reasons. Rome is the principal base of the dubbing industry, where major productions such as movies, drama, documentaries and some cartoons are dubbed. However, dubbing in Milan is mostly of cartoons and some minor productions. Practically every foreign film (mostly American ones) of every genre, for children or adults, as well as TV shows, are dubbed into Italian. In big cities, original-version movies can also be seen in some theaters but it is not so common. Subtitles may be available on [[Late night television|late-night programs]] on mainstream TV channels, and on pay-TV all movies are available in the original language with Italian subtitles, many shows featuring their original [[soundtrack]]s.\n\nEarly in their careers, actors such as [[Alberto Sordi]] or [[Nino Manfredi]] worked extensively as dubbing actors. At one point, common practice in Italian cinema was to shoot scenes [[MOS (filmmaking)|MOS]] (motor only sync or motor only shot) and dub the dialogue in post-production. A notable example of this practice is ''[[The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly]]'', in which all actors had to dub in their own voices.\n\nVideo games are generally either dubbed into Italian (for instance [[Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed]] saga, [[Halo (series)|Halo]] or [[Harry Potter (video games)|Harry Potter]] series etc.) or released with original-speaking tracks but with all the texts translated into Italian language.\n\nA list of the voice actors that have dubbed for celebrities in Italian can be enlisted here.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Some dubbing actors have achieved popularity for their voices, such as [[Constantino Romero]] (who dubs [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Darth Vader]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]'s [[The Terminator|Terminator]], among others) and [[\u00d3scar Mu\u00f1oz (filmmaking)|\u00d3scar Mu\u00f1oz]] (the official European Spanish dub-over voice artist for [[Elijah Wood]] and [[Hayden Christensen]]). Currently, with the spread of [[digital terrestrial television]], viewers can choose between the original and the dubbed soundtracks for most movies and television.\n\nIn some communities such as [[Catalonia]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], some foreign programs are also dubbed into their own languages, different from European Spanish. Films from \nthe Spanish-speaking America shown in these communities are shown in their original language, while strong regional accents (from the Spanish-speaking America or from Spain) may be subtitled in news and documentaries.\n\n=====Germany, Austria and Switzerland=====\nThe [[German language|Germanophone]] dubbing market is the largest in Europe. Germany has the most foreign-movie-dubbing studios per capita and per given area in the world and according to the German newspaper [[Die Welt]] 52% of all voice actors currently work in the German dubbing industry. In Germany, Austria, and the German-speaking part of [[Switzerland]], practically all films, shows, television series and foreign [[soap opera]]s are shown in dubbed versions created for the German market. However, in some of Switzerland's towns and cities (particularly along the language-borders), subtitled versions are common. Dubbing films is a traditional and common practice in German-speaking Europe, since subtitles are not accepted and used as much as in other European countries. According to a European study, Austria is the country with the highest rejection rate (more than 70 percent) of subtitles, followed by Italy, Spain and Germany.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\nIn German-speaking markets, [[PC game|computer]] and video games feature German text menus and are dubbed into the German language if speaking parts exist.\n\nIn recent years, Swiss and Austrian television stations have been showing increasing numbers of movies, series and TV-programmes in \"dual sound,\" which means the viewer can choose between the original language (e.g. English) and the language of the channel (German, French or Italian, according to the location).\n\nAlthough German-speaking [[voice actor]]s play only a secondary role, they are still notable for providing familiar voices to well-known actors. Famous foreign actors are known and recognised for their [[German language|German]] voice, and the German audience is used to them, so dubbing is also a matter of authenticity. However, in larger cities, there are theaters where movies can be seen in their original versions, as [[English language|English]] has become somewhat more popular among young educated viewers. On German [[mainstream]] television, films are never broadcast with subtitles, but pay-per-view programming is often available in the original language. Subtitled niche and [[art film]]s are sometimes aired on smaller networks.\n\nGerman-dubbed versions sometimes diverge greatly from the original, especially in adding humorous elements absent from the original. In extreme cases, such as ''[[The Persuaders!]]'', the German-dubbed version was more successful than the English original. Often, translation adds [[sexually explicit]] gags the U.S. versions might not be allowed to use. For example, in ''[[Bewitched (2005 film)|Bewitched]]'', the translators changed ''\"The [[Door hanger|Do Not Disturb sign]] will hang on the door tonight\"'' to ''\"The only hanging thing tonight will be the Do Not Disturb sign\"''.\n\nSome movies dubbed in Austria diverge from the German Standard version in addressing other people but only when the movies are dubbed into certain Austrian dialect versions. (Mr. and Mrs. are translated into Herr and Frau which is usually not translated in order to be in lip-sync).\nSometimes even English pronounced first names are translated and are pronounced into the correct German equivalent (English name \"Bert\" became Southern German pronounced name \"Bertl\" which is an abbreviation for any name either beginning or even ending with \"bert\", e.g. \"Berthold\" or \"Albert\".)\n\nSome movies dubbed before [[German reunification|reunification]] exist in different versions for the [[East Germany|east]] and the [[West Germany|west]]. They use different translations, and often differ in the style of dubbing.\n\nSome of the well-known German dubbing voice artists are listed below.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Czech dubbing was also extensively used in the broadcast of Slovak television channels, but since 2008 Slovak language laws require any newer shows (understood as the first television broadcast in Slovakia) to be provided with Slovak localisation (dubbing or subtitles); since then, television broadcasts of films, TV series and cartoons have been dubbed into Slovak.\n\n=====Hungary=====\n<!-- Please do not change this section to Romanian because the sources in this section are directly related to Hungary.-->\nIn [[Hungary]], dubbing is almost universally common. Almost every foreign movie or TV show released in Hungary is dubbed into Hungarian.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://matadornetwork.com/abroad/9-culture-shocks-americans-will-hungary/ |title=9 culture shocks Americans will have in Hungary}}</ref> The history of dubbing dates back to the 1950s, when the country was still under communist rule.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.masterfilm.hu/services |title=Masterfilm :: Services}}</ref> One of the most iconic Hungarian dubs was of the American cartoon ''[[The Flintstones]]'', with a local translation by [[J\u00f3zsef Romh\u00e1nyi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sherlockian-sherlock.com/the-dubbed-versions-of-sherlock-holmes.php |title=Dubbed versions Sherlock Holmes, dubbing, hungarian voices}}</ref> The Internetes Szinkron Adatb\u00e1zis (ISzDB) is the largest Hungarian database for film dubs, with information for many live action and animated films.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iszdb.hu |title=ISzDb - Internetes Szinkron Adatb\u00e1zis}}</ref> On page 59 of the Eurobarometer, 84% of Hungarians said that they prefer dubbing over subtitles.<ref name=\"eurobarometer\" />\n\nIn the [[Socialism|socialist]] era, every film was dubbed with professional and mostly popular actors. Care was taken to make sure the same voice actor would lend his voice to the same original actor. In the early 1990s, as cinemas tried to keep up with showing newly released films, subtitling became dominant in the cinema. This, in turn, forced TV channels to make their own cheap versions of dubbed soundtracks for the movies they presented, resulting in a constant degrading of dubbing quality. Once this became customary, cinema distributors resumed the habit of dubbing for popular productions, presenting them in a below-average quality. However, every feature is presented with the original soundtrack in at least one cinema in large towns and cities.\n\nHowever, in Hungary, most documentary films and series (for example, those on [[Discovery Channel]], [[National Geographic Channel]]) are made with [[Voice-over|voiceovers]]. Some old movies and series, or ones that provide non-translatable jokes and conversations (for example, the ''[[Mr. Bean]]'' television series), are shown only with subtitles.\n\nThere is a more recent problem arising from dubbing included on DVD releases. Many generations have grown up with an original (and, by current technological standards, outdated) soundtrack, which is either technologically (mono or bad quality stereo sound) or legally (expired soundtrack license) unsuitable for a DVD release. Many original features are released on DVD with a new soundtrack, which in some cases proves to be extremely unpopular, thus forcing DVD producers to include the original soundtrack. In some rare cases, the Hungarian soundtrack is left out altogether. This happens notably with Warner Home Video Hungary, which ignored the existence of Hungarian soundtracks completely, as they did not want to pay the licenses for the soundtracks to be included on their new DVD releases, which appear with improved picture quality, but very poor subtitling.\n\n=====Poland=====\n{{essay|section|date=October 2016}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nIn [[Poland]], cinema releases for general audiences are almost exclusively subtitled, with the exception of children's movies, and television screenings of movies, as well as made-for-TV shows. These are usually shown with voice-over, where a voice talent reads a translation over the original soundtrack. This method, called \"juxtareading,\" is similar to the so-called [[Gavrilov translation]] in Russia, with one difference\u2014all dialogues are voiced by one off-screen reader ({{lang-pl|lektor}}), preferably with a deep and neutral voice which does not interfere with the pitch of voice of the original speakers in the background. To some extent, it resembles live translation. Certain highly qualified voice talents are traditionally assigned to particular kinds of production, such as action or drama. Standard dubbing is not widely popular with most audiences, with the exception of cartoons and children's shows, which are dubbed also for TV releases.\n\nIt is claimed that, until around 1951, there were no revoiced foreign movies available in Poland. Instead, they were exclusively subtitled in Polish.<ref>{{cite book|title=Das kulturelle Leben der Deutschen in Niederschlesien unter polnischer Verwaltung. 1947-1958|first=Bernhard|last=Grund|publisher=Bundesministerium f\u00fcr gesamtdeutsche Fragen|place=Bonn und Berlin|date=1967|series=Bonner Berichte aus Mittel- und Ostdeutschland|page=119}}</ref>\n\nPoland's dubbing traditions began between the two world wars. In 1931, among the first movies dubbed into Polish were ''[[Dangerous Curves (1929 film)|Dangerous Curves]]'' (1929), ''[[The Dance of Life]]'' (1929), ''[[Paramount on Parade]]'' (1930), and ''[[Darling of the Gods]]'' (1930). In 1949, the first dubbing studio opened in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]. The first film dubbed that year was ''Russkiy Vopros'' (filmed 1948).\n\nPolish dubbing in the first post-war years suffered from poor synchronisation. Polish dialogues were not always audible and the cinema equipment of that time often made films sound less clear than they were. In the 1950s, Polish publicists discussed the quality of Polish versions of foreign movies.\n\nThe number of dubbed movies and the quality improved. Polish dubbing had a golden age between the 1960s and the 1980s. Approximately a third of foreign movies screened in cinemas were dubbed. The \"Polish dubbing school\" was known for its high quality. In that time, Poland had some of the best dubbing in the world. The person who initiated high-quality dubbing versions was director Zofia Dybowska-Aleksandrowicz. In that time, dubbing in Poland was very popular. Polish television dubbed popular films and TV series such as ''[[Rich Man, Poor Man (miniseries)|Rich Man, Poor Man]]''; ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', ''[[Forsyte Saga]]'', ''[[Elizabeth R]]'', ''[[I, Claudius]]'', ''[[I'll Take Manhattan (miniseries)|I'll Take Manhattan]]'', and ''[[Peter the Great (TV series)|Peter the Great]]''.\n\nIn the 1980s, due to budget cuts, state-run TV saved on tapes by voicing films over live during transmission.\n\nOverall, during 1948-1998, almost 1,000 films were dubbed in Polish. In the 1990s, dubbing films and TV series continued, although often also for one emission only.\n\nIn 1995, [[Canal+]] was launched in Poland. In its first years, it dubbed 30% of its schedule dubbing popular films and TV series, one of the best-known and popular dubbings was that of ''[[Friends (TV series)|Friends]]'', but this proved unsuccessful.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20151222233455/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119215016517556740 On Polish TV, Desperate Wives Sound Like Guys], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', 12 October 2007</ref> It stopped dubbing films in 1999, although many people supported the idea of dubbing and bought the access only for dubbing versions of foreign productions. In the 1990s, dubbing was done by the television channel known as [[Wizja Jeden]]. They mainly dubbed [[BBC]] productions such as ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]'', ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'' and ''[[Men Behaving Badly]]''. Wizja Jeden was closed in 2001. In the same year, TVP stopped dubbing the TV series ''[[Frasier]]'', although that dubbing was very popular.\n\nCurrently, dubbing of films and TV series for teenagers is made by Nickelodeon and Disney Channel. One of the major breakthroughs in dubbing was the Polish release of ''Shrek'', which contained many references to local culture and Polish humour. Since then, people seem to have grown to like dubbed versions more, and pay more attention to the dubbing actors.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} However, this seems to be the case only with animated films, as live-action dubbing is still considered a bad practice. In the case of [[DVD|DVD releases]], most discs contain both the original soundtrack and subtitles, and either voice over or dubbed Polish track. The dubbed version is, in most cases, the one from the theater release, while voice-over is provided for movies that were only subtitled in theaters.\n\nSince theatrical release of ''The Avengers'' in May 2012, Walt Disney Company Polska dubs all films for cinema releases. Also in 2012, [[United International Pictures]] Polska dubbed ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', while Forum Film Polska \u2013 former distributor of Disney's films \u2013 decided to dub ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'', along with its [[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug|two]] [[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|sequels]]. However, when a dub is produced but the film's target audience is not exclusively children, both dubbed and subtitled versions are usually available in movie theaters. The dubbed versions are more commonly shown in morning and early afternoon hours, with the subtitled version dominating in the evening. Both can be available in parallel at similar hours in multiplexes.\n\n=====Russia=====\n[[Russia]]n television is generally dubbed, but in the cases using voice-over dub technique with only a couple of voice actors, with the original speech still audible underneath. In the [[Soviet Union]], most foreign movies to be officially released were dubbed. Voice-over dub was invented in the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1980s when with the fall of the regime, many popular foreign movies, previously forbidden, or at least questionable under communist rule, started to flood in, in the form of low-quality home-copied videos. Being unofficial releases, they were dubbed in a very primitive way. For example, the translator spoke the text directly over the audio of a video being copied, using primitive equipment.\n\nThe quality of the resulting dub was very low, the translated phrases were off-sync, interfering with the original voices, background sounds leaked into the track, translation was inaccurate and, most importantly, all dub voices were made by a single person who usually lacked the intonation of the original, making comprehension of some scenes quite difficult. This method of translation exerted a strong influence on Russian pop culture. Voices of translators became recognizable for generations.\n\nIn modern Russia, the overdubbing technique is still used in many cases, although with vastly improved quality, and now with multiple voice actors dubbing different original voices. Video games are generally either dubbed into Russian (such as the ''Legend of Spyro'' trilogy, the ''Skylanders'' series, the ''Assassin's Creed'' saga, the ''Halo'' series, the ''Harry Potter'' series, etc.) or released with original-speaking tracks but with all the texts translated into Russian language.\n\nReleases of cinemas are almost always dubbed in the Russian language. On television series are shown as a dubbed translation and offscreen. Subtitles are not used at all.\n\n=====Ukraine=====\nIn [[Ukraine]], since 2006 cinema releases are almost always dubbed into Ukrainian with the overdubbing technique and multiple voice actors dubbing different original voices with a small percent of art-house/documentaries shown in the original language with Ukrainian subtitles. For television, TV channels usually release movies and TV-shows with a Ukrainian voiceover, although certain high-profile films and TV shows are dubbed rather than voice-overe'ed.\n\nIn the past Russian-language films, TV series, cartoons, animated series and TV programs were usually not dubbed but were shown with the original audio with Ukrainian subtitles. However, this practise has been slowly abandoned since the late 2010s: all children's films and cartoons regardless of the original language (including Russian) are always dubbed into Ukrainian; example of the first Russian cartoons dubbed into Ukrainian for the cinematic-release is [[The Snow Queen 2]] (2015), [[A Warrior's Tail]] (2015), Volki i Ovtsy: Be-e-e-zumnoe prevrashenie (2016), Ivan Tsarevich i Seryy Volk 3 (2016), Bremenskie razboyniki (2016), [[The Snow Queen 3: Fire and Ice|The Snow Queen 3: Fire and Ice (2017)]], [[Fantastic Journey to OZ]] (2017), Fixies: Top Secret (2017) etc.; the same trend is seen among Russian language feature films for adults, with the first such films dubbed into Ukrainian including [[Battle for Sevastopol|Battle for Sevastopol (2015)]], [[Hardcore Henry|Hardcore Henry (2016)]], [[The Duelist (2016 film)|The Duelist (2016)]].\n\n=====Latvia and Lithuania=====\nIn [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]], only children's movies get dubbed in the cinema, while many live-action movies for an older audience use voice-over. In recent years however, many cartoons have been dubbed into Latvian and Lithuanian for TV. But some other kids shows, like ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', use the voice-over.\n\n===Americas===\n====United States and English-speaking Canada====\nIn the United States and English-speaking Canada, [[live-action]] foreign films are usually shown in theaters with their original languages (with English subtitles). It is because live-action dubbed movies rarely did well in United States box office since the 1980s. The 1982 United States theatrical release of Wolfgang Peterson's ''[[Das Boot]]'' was the last major release to go out in both original and English-dubbed versions, and the film's original version actually grossed much higher than the English-dubbed version.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/1999/08/editorial-life-isnt-beautiful-anymore-its-dubbed-82123/|title=EDITORIAL: Life Isn't Beautiful Anymore, it's Dubbed|last=Indiewire|date=23 August 1999|accessdate=1 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/19/business/will-dubbing-fly-in-the-us-read-my-lips.html?gwh=5B7FDE5A22B394D810DA99A95EFCDECB&gwt=pay|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805152511/https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/19/business/will-dubbing-fly-in-the-us-read-my-lips.html?gwh=5B7FDE5A22B394D810DA99A95EFCDECB&gwt=pay|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 August 2018|title=Will Dubbing Fly in the U.S.?

The exceptions to this practice are either when an English dub has not been produced for the program (usually in the case of feature films) or when the program is being presented by a network that places importance on presenting it in its original format (as was the case when [[Turner Classic Movies]] aired several of [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s works, which were presented both dubbed and subtitled). Most [[anime]] DVDs contain options for original Japanese, Japanese with subtitles, and English-dubbed, except for a handful of series that have been heavily edited or [[Americanized|Americanised]]. In addition, Disney has a policy that makes its directors undergo stages to perfect alignment of certain lip movements so the movie looks believable.\n\nIn addition, a small number of British films have been re-dubbed when released in the United States, due to the usage of dialects which Americans are not familiar with (for example, ''[[Kes (film)|Kes]]'' and ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]''). However, British children's shows (such as ''[[Bob the Builder]]'') are always re-dubbed with American voice actors in order to make the series more understandable for American children. Conversely, British programs shown in Canada are not re-dubbed.\n\nSome television shows shown in the US have Spanish dubs.  These are accessible though the SAP (secondary audio program) function of the television unit.\n\n====Spanish-speaking countries====\nFor Spanish-speaking countries, all foreign-language programs, films, cartoons and documentaries shown on free-to-air TV networks are dubbed into [[Standard Spanish]], while broadcasts on [[Cable television|cable]] and [[Satellite television|satellite]] pan-regional channels are either dubbed or subtitled. In theaters, children's movies and most blockbuster films are dubbed into Standard Spanish or [[Mexican Spanish]], and are sometimes further dubbed into regional dialects of Spanish where they are released.\n\n====Mexico====\nIn [[Mexico]], by law, films shown in theaters must be shown in their original version. Films in languages other than Spanish are usually subtitled. Only educational documentaries and movies rated for children, as well as some movies that are expected to have a wide audience (for example, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' or ''[[Marvel's The Avengers|The Avengers]]'') may be dubbed, but this is not compulsory, and some animated films are shown in theaters in both dubbed and subtitled versions (for instance, some [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]] productions). Nonetheless, a recent trend in several cinemas is to offer the dubbed versions only, with a stark decrease in the showing of the original ones.\n\nDubbing must be made in Mexico by Mexican nationals or foreigners residing in Mexico.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/103.pdf |title=Ley Federal de Cinematograf\u00eda |language=Spanish |trans-title=Federal Law of Filmmaking |publisher=C\u00e1mara de Diputados |date=28 April 2010 |accessdate=22 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722125937/http://www.diputados.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/103.pdf |archivedate=22 July 2011  }}</ref> Still, several programs that are shown on pay TV are dubbed in other countries like [[Venezuela]], [[Chile]] or [[Colombia]].\n\nMost movies released on DVD feature [[Standard Spanish|neutral Spanish]] as a language option, and sometimes feature a specific dub for Mexican audiences (for example, ''Rio''). Foreign programs are dubbed on [[broadcast television systems|broadcast TV]], while on [[pay TV]] most shows and movies are subtitled. In a similar way to cinemas, in the last few years many channels on pay TV have begun to broadcast programs and films only in their dubbed version.\n\nDubbing became very popular in the 1990s with the rise in popularity of anime in Mexico. Some voice actors have become celebrities and are always identified with specific characters, such as [[Mario Casta\u00f1eda]] (who became popular by dubbing [[Goku]] in ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'') or [[Humberto V\u00e9lez]] (who dubbed [[Homer Simpson]] in the first 15 seasons of ''[[The Simpsons]]'').\n\nThe popularity of pay TV has allowed people to view several series in their original language rather than dubbed. Dubbing has been criticised for the use of TV or movie stars as voice actors (such as [[Ricky Martin]] in Disney's ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]'', or [[Eugenio Derbez]] in DreamWorks' ''Shrek''), or for the incorrect use of local popular culture that sometimes creates unintentional jokes or breaks the feeling of the original work (such as translating [[Sheldon Cooper]]'s \"Bazinga!\" to \"\u00a1Vacil\u00f3n!\").\n\nSeveral video games have been dubbed into neutral Spanish, rather than European Spanish, in Mexico (such as the ''Gears of War'' series, ''Halo 3'', ''Infamous 2'' and others). [[Sony]] recently announced that more games (such as ''God of War: Ascension'') will be dubbed into neutral Spanish.\n\n====Peru====\nIn [[Peru]], all foreign series, movies, and animated programming are shown dubbed in Latin American Spanish, with dubs imported from Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Venezuela on terrestrial and pay-television. Most movies intended for kids are being offered as dub-only movies, while most films aimed at older audiences are being offered dubbed and subtitled in Spanish. Also, at most theaters, kids films (on rare occasions) subtitled are commonly shown at nighttime. Most subtitled Pay-TV channels show both dubbed and subtitled version of every film they broadcast, being offered with a separate subtitle track and a second audio track in English. There is an increase of people preferring subtitle films and series rather than dubbed starting the late-2000s, as Peruvians viewers tend to get used to their original version.\n\nPeru used to do not produce their own dubs since dubbing studios never existed in that country until 2016, when the company \"Big Bang Films\" started to dub movies and series, however, since 2014 a group of dubbing actors created a group called \"Torre A Doblaje\", who is a group of actors who gives dubbing and locution service.\n\n====Brazil====\nIn [[Brazil]], foreign programs are invariably dubbed into [[Brazilian Portuguese]] on [[free to air TV]], with only a few exceptions. Films shown at cinemas are generally offered with both subtitled and dubbed versions, with dubbing frequently being the only choice for children's movies. Subtitling was primarily for adult audience movies until 2012. Since then, dubbed versions also became available for all ages. As a result, in recent years, more cinemas have opened in Brazil, attracting new audiences to the cinema who prefer dubbing. According to a [[Datafolha]] survey, 56% of Brazilian movie theaters' audience prefer to watch dubbed movies.<ref>http://revistaepoca.globo.com/cultura/noticia/2012/06/dublagem-venceu-legendas.html</ref> Most of the dubbing studios in Brazil is in the cities of [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[S\u00e3o Paulo]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140319091221/http://ne10.uol.com.br/canal/cultura/noticia/2012/05/27/cresce-preferencia-por-filmes-dublados-nos-cinemas-brasileiros-344927.php Cresce prefer\u00eancia por filmes dublados nos cinemas brasileiros (in Portuguese)] Ne10, 27 May 2012. Retrieved 17 August 2012.</ref>\n\nThe first film to be dubbed in Brazil was the [[Disney]] animation ''\"[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]\"'' in 1938. By the end of the 1950s, most of the movies, TV series and cartoons on television in Brazil were shown in its original sound and subtitles. However, in 1962, a decree of President [[J\u00e2nio Quadros]] ruled that all foreign productions on television should be dubbed. This measure boosted the growth of dubbing in Brazil, and has led to several dubbing studios since then.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://mundoestranho.abril.com.br/cinema-e-tv/quando-surgiu-a-dublagem-no-brasil-e-no-mundo/ | title=Quando surgiu a dublagem no Brasil e no mundo?}}</ref> The biggest dubbing studio in Brazil was [[Herbert Richers]], headquartered in [[Rio de Janeiro (city)|Rio de Janeiro]] and closed in 2009, At its peak in the 80s and 90s, the Herbert Richers studios dubbed about 70% of the productions shown in Brazilian cinemas.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://super.abril.com.br/mundo-estranho/quem-e-herbert-richers/ |title = Quem \u00e9 Herbert Richers?}}</ref>\n\nIn the 90's, with Saint Seiya, Dragon Ball and other anime shows becoming popular in Brazilian TV's, the voice actors and the dubbing career gained a higher space in Brazilian culture. Actors like [[Hermes Baroli]] (Brazilian dubber of [[Pegasus Seiya]], in ''[[Saint Seiya]]'' and actors like [[Ashton Kutcher]]), [[Marco Ribeiro]] (Brazilian dubber of many actors like [[Tom Hanks]], [[Jim Carrey]] and [[Robert Downey Jr.]], and [[Yusuke Urameshi]] from the anime ''[[Yu Yu Hakusho]]'') and [[Wendel Bezerra]] (Brazilian dubber of [[Goku]] in ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' and [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]] in ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'') are recognised for their most notable roles.\n\nPay TV commonly offers both dubbed and subtitled movies, with statistics showing that dubbed versions are becoming predominant.<ref>[http://oglobo.globo.com/revista-da-tv/dublagem-em-canais-de-tv-paga-provoca-polemica-3262532 Dublagem em canais de TV paga provoca pol\u00eamica (in Portuguese)] O Globo, 20 November 2011. Retrieved 17 August 2012.</ref> Most [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] releases usually feature Portuguese, Spanish, and the original audio along with subtitles in native languages. Most video games are dubbed in Brazilian Portuguese rather than having European Portuguese dubs alone. Games such as ''[[Halo 3]]'', ''[[God of War: Ascension]]'', ''[[inFamous 2]]'', ''[[Assassin's Creed III]]'', ''[[Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure]]'', ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' and others are dubbed in Brazilian Portuguese. This is because despite the dropping of the dubbing law in Portugal in 1994, most companies in that country use the Brazilian Portuguese because of traditional usage during the days of the dubbing rule, along with these dubbings being more marketable than European Portuguese.\n\nA list that showcases Brazilian Portuguese voice artists that dub for actors and actresses are displayed here. However, there can also be different official dub artists for certain regions within Brazil. \n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n! Brazilian Portuguese dubbing artists !!

They speak with a mixed accent, they pronounce /\u025b\u0303/ with a Parisian accent, but they pronounce \"\u00e2\" and \"\u00ea\" with a Quebec accent: ''gr\u00e2ce'' [\u0261\u0281\u0251\u02d0s] and ''\u00eatre'' [\u025b\u02d0t\u0281\u0325]. Occasionally, the dubbing of a series or a movie, such as ''The Simpsons'', is made using the more widely spoken ''[[joual]]'' variety of Quebec French. Dubbing has the advantage of making children's films and TV series more comprehensible to younger audiences. However, many [[bilingual]] Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois prefer subtitling, since they would understand some or all of the original audio. In addition, all films are shown in English, as well in certain theaters (especially in major cities and English-speaking areas such as the [[West Island]]), and some theatres, such as the Scotiabank Cinema [[Montreal]], show only movies in English. Most American television series are only available in English on [[DVD]], or on English-language channels, but some of the more popular ones have French dubs shown on mainstream networks, and are released in French on DVD as well, sometimes separately from an English-only version.\n\nFormerly, all French-language dubbed films in Quebec were imported from France and some still are. Such a practice was criticised by former politician [[Mario Dumont]] after he took his children to see the [[Standard French|Parisian French]] dub of ''Shrek the Third'', which Dumont found incomprehensible.<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/quebec-pressing-hollywood-to-justify-lack-of-movie-dubbing/article1352554/ Quebec pressing Hollywood to justify lack of movie dubbing], The Canadian Press, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', 26 May 2008</ref> After his complaints and a proposed bill, ''[[Bee Movie]]'', the film from [[DreamWorks Animation]], was dubbed in Quebec, making it the studio's first animated film to have a Quebec French dub, as all DreamWorks Animation films had previously been dubbed in France.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dr\u00f4le d'abeille (v.o.a) Bee Movie |url=http://doublage.qc.ca/showMovie.php?id=1981 |work=Doublage.qc.ca |publisher=idgrafix |accessdate=30 July 2012 |author=Doublage.qc.ca |language=French}}</ref> In terms of Disney, the first Disney animated film to be dubbed in Quebec was ''Oliver and Company.'' The Disney Renaissance films were also dubbed in Quebec except for ''The Rescuers Down Under'', ''Beauty and the Beast'', and ''The Lion King''.\n\nIn addition, because Canadian viewers usually find Quebec French more comprehensible than other dialects of the language, some older film series that had the French-language versions of previous installments dubbed in France have had later ones dubbed in Quebec, often creating inconsistencies within the French version of the series' canon. [[Lucasfilm]]'s ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' series are examples. Both series had films released in the 1970s and 1980s, with no Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois French dubbed versions; instead, the Parisian French versions, with altered character and object names and terms, were distributed in the province. However, later films in both series released 1999 and later were dubbed in Quebec, using different voice actors and \"reversing\" name changes made in France's dubbings due to the change in studio.\n\n===Asia===\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2013}}\n\n====China====\nChina has a long tradition of dubbing foreign films into [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], starting in the 1930s. While during the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] era Western motion pictures may have been imported and dubbed into Chinese, since 1950 [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet movies]], dubbed primarily in Shanghai, became the main import.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|1987|p=40}}</ref> Beginning in the late 1970s, in addition to films, popular TV series from the United States, Japan, Brazil, and Mexico were also dubbed. The [[Shanghai]] Film Dubbing Studio has been the most well-known studio in the film dubbing industry in China. In order to generate high-quality products, they divide each film into short segments, each one lasting only a few minutes, and then work on the segments one-by-one. In addition to the correct meaning in translation, they make tremendous effort to match the lips of the actors to the dialogue. As a result, the dubbing in these films generally is not readily detected. The cast of dubbers is acknowledged at the end of a dubbed film. Several dubbing actors and actresses of the Shanghai Film Dubbing Studio have become well-known celebrities, such as Qiu Yuefeng, Bi Ke, Li Zi, and Liu Guangning. In recent years, however, especially in the larger cities on the east and south coasts, it has become increasingly common for movie theaters to show subtitled versions with the original soundtracks intact.\n\nMotion pictures are also dubbed into the languages of some of China's [[Autonomous administrative divisions of China|autonomous regions]]. Notably, the Translation Department of the [[Tibetan Autonomous Region]] Movie Company (\u897f\u85cf\u81ea\u6cbb\u533a\u7535\u5f71\u516c\u53f8\u8bd1\u5236\u79d1)<ref name=humes20131122>[http://www.bruce-humes.com/?p=9736 Confucius the Movie: China Flop Dubbed at the State\u2019s Expense for Tibetan Movie-goers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131130085415/http://www.bruce-humes.com/?p=9736 |date=30 November 2013 }}, 22 November 2013</ref> has been dubbing movies into the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan language]] since the 1960s. In the early decades, it would dub 25 to 30 movies each year, the number rising to 60-75 by the early 2010s.<ref name=humes20131122/><ref>[http://www.china.org.cn/china/Off_the_Wire/2013-02/24/content_28045511.htm China Focus: Dubbed movies spice up life for Tibetans], Xinhua News Agency, 24 February 2013.</ref>\nMotion pictures are dubbed for China's [[Mongols in China|Mongol-]] and [[Uyghur language|Uyghur-speaking]] markets as well.<ref>{{citation\n|first=Paul |last=Clark|publisher=CUP Archive |year=1987|isbn=0521326389\n|title=Chinese Cinema: Culture and Politics Since 1949|series=Cambridge studies in film\n|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=jzQ9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA60|page=60}}</ref>\n\n====Taiwan====\n[[Taiwan]] dubs some foreign films and TV series in Mandarin Chinese. Until the mid-1990s, the major national [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial channels]] both dubbed and subtitled all foreign programs and films and, for some popular programs, the original voices were offered in [[second audio program]]. Gradually, however, both terrestrial and cable channels stopped dubbing for [[prime time]] U.S. shows and films, while subtitling continued.\n\nIn the 2000s, the dubbing practice has differed depending on the nature and origin of the program. Animations, children's shows and some educational programs on PTS are mostly dubbed. English live-action movies and shows are not dubbed in theaters or on television. Japanese TV dramas are no longer dubbed, while [[Korean language|Korean]] dramas, [[Hong Kong]] dramas and dramas from other Asian countries are still often dubbed. Korean variety shows are not dubbed. Japanese and Korean films on Asian movie channels are still dubbed. In theaters, most foreign films are not dubbed, while animated films and some films meant for children offer a dubbed version. Hong Kong live-action films have a long tradition of being dubbed into Mandarin, while more famous films offer a [[Cantonese]] version.\n\n====Hong Kong====\nIn [[Hong Kong]], foreign television programmes, except for English-language and Mandarin television programmes, are dubbed in Cantonese. English-language and Mandarin programmes are generally shown in their original with subtitles. Foreign films, such as most live-action and animated films (such as anime and Disney), are usually dubbed in Cantonese. However most cinemas also offer subtitled versions of English-language films.\n\nFor the most part, foreign films and TV programmes, both live-action and animated, are generally dubbed in both Mandarin and Cantonese. For example, in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' film series, Elijah Wood's character [[Frodo Baggins]] was dubbed into Mandarin by [[Jiang Guangtao]] for China and Taiwan. For the Cantonese localisation, there were actually two dubs for Hong Kong and [[Macau]]. The first Cantonese dub, he was voiced by Leung Wai Tak, with a second Cantonese dub released, he was voiced by Bosco Tang.\n\nA list for Mandarin and Cantonese voice artists that dub for actors are shown here.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

In programs aimed at teenagers and adults, dubbing is rarely considered for translation, not only because of its high costs, but also because the audience is mainly multi-lingual. Most viewers in Israel speak at least one European language in addition to Hebrew, and a large part of the audience also speaks [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. Therefore, most viewers prefer to hear the original soundtrack, aided by Hebrew subtitles. Another problem is that dubbing does not allow for translation into two different languages simultaneously, as is often the case of Israeli television channels that use subtitles in Hebrew and another language (like [[Russian language|Russian]]) simultaneously.\n\n====Japan====\nIn Japan, many television programs appear on Japanese television subtitled or dubbed if they are intended for children. When the American film ''[[Morocco (film)|Morocco]]'' was released in Japan in 1931, subtitles became the mainstream method of translating TV programs and films in Japan. Later, around the 1950s, foreign television programs and films began to be shown dubbed in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] on television. The first ones to be dubbed into Japanese were [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|the 1940s Superman cartoons]] in 1955.\n\nDue to the lack of video software for domestic television, video software was imported from abroad. When the television program was shown on television, it was mostly dubbed. There was a character limit for a small TV screen at a lower resolution, and this method was not suitable for the poor elderly and illiterate eye, as was audio dubbing. Presently, TV shows and movies (both those aimed at all ages and adults-only) are shown dubbed with the original language and Japanese subtitles, while providing the original language option when the same film is released on [[VHS]], [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]]. Laserdisc releases of Hollywood films were almost always subtitled.\n\nAdult cartoons such as ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', and ''[[The Simpsons]]'' are shown dubbed in Japanese on the [[WOWOW]] TV channel. ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut]]'' was dubbed in Japanese by different actors instead of the same Japanese dubbing-actors from the cartoon because it was handled by a different Japanese dubbing studio, and it was marketed for the [[Kansai region|Kansai]] market. In Japanese theaters, foreign-language movies, except those intended for children, are usually shown in their original version with Japanese subtitles. Foreign films usually contain multiple Japanese-dubbing versions, but with several different original Japanese-dubbing voice actors, depending upon which TV station they are aired. [[NHK]], [[Nippon TV]], [[Fuji TV]], [[TV Asahi]], and [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] usually follow this practice, as do software releases on [[VHS]], [[Laserdisc]], [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]]. As for recent foreign films being released, there are now some film theaters in Japan that show both dubbed and subtitled editions.\n\nOn 22 June 2009, [[20th Century Fox]]'s Japanese division has opened up a [[Blu-ray]] lineup known as \"Emperor of Dubbing\", dedicated at having multiple Japanese dubs of popular English-language films (mostly Hollywood films) as well as retaining the original scripts, releasing them altogether in special Blu-ray releases. These also feature a new dub created exclusively for that release as a director's cut, or a new dub made with a better surround sound mix to match that of the original English mix (as most older Japanese dubbings were made on mono mixes to be aired on TV). Other companies have followed practice, like Universal Pictures's Japanese division [[NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan]] opening up \"Reprint of Memories\", along with [[:ja:\u30ef\u30fc\u30ca\u30fc \u30a8\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30c6\u30a4\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8 \u30b8\u30e3\u30d1\u30f3|Warner Bros Japan]] having \"Power of Dubbing\", which act in a similar way by re-packaging all the multiple Japanese dubs of popular films and putting them out as Special Blu-ray releases.\n\n\"Japanese dub-over artists\" provide the voices for certain performers, such as those listed in the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

However, some anime is censored, such as Japanese letters or content being edited for a suitable Korean audience. Western cartoons are dubbed in Korean as well, such as [[Nickelodeon]] cartoons like ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' and ''[[Danny Phantom]]''. Several English-language (mostly American) live-action films are dubbed in [[Korean language|Korean]], but they are not shown in theaters. Instead they are only broadcast on South Korean television networks ([[Korean Broadcasting System|KBS]], [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation|MBC]], [[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]], [[Educational Broadcasting System|EBS]]), while DVD import releases of these films are shown with Korean subtitles, such as ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, and ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''. This may be due to the fact that the six American [[major film studio]]s may not own any rights to the Korean dubs of their live-action films that the Korean television networks have dubbed and aired. Even if they don't own the rights, Korean or non-Korean viewers can record from Korean-dubbed live-action films from television broadcasting onto DVDs with [[Digital video recorder|DVRs]].\n\nSometimes, video games are dubbed in Korean. Examples would be the ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' series, the ''[[Jak & Daxter (series)|Jak & Daxter]]'' series, and the ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' series. For the ''Halo'' games, Lee Jeong Gu provides his Korean voice to the main protagonist [[Characters of Halo|Master Chief]] (replacing [[Steve Downes]]'s voice), while [[Kim So Hyeong (voice actor)|Kim So Hyeong]] voices [[Characters of Halo|Chieftain Tartarus]], one of the main antagonists (replacing [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]'s voice).\n\nThe following South Korean voice-over artists are usually identified with the following actors:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Movie theaters in [[Bangkok]] and some larger cities show both the subtitled version and the dubbed version of English-language movies. In big cities like Bangkok, Thai-language movies have English subtitles. <!-- For English-language animated movies, Disney films like ''[[The Lion King]]'', ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' and ''[[Tangled]]'' are dubbed entirely in Thai.\n\nChonnai Sukawat has provided the Thai-dubbing voice for the heroine Rapunzel in the film ''Tangled''. In the Thai version of ''Harry Potter'', [[Hermione Granger]] was dubbed by Thai singer and actress Bismillah Nana. Many English-language movies are sold on [[VCD]]s in Thailand, with the original English language and Thai subtitles, while also available with the Thai-language-dubbed version, such as ''[[Eragon (film)|Eragon]]'', ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', the ''Harry Potter'' film series, and ''The Lord of the Rings'' film series.

In general, the decision whether to dub a video production depends mainly on the target audience of the channel on which the feature will be aired, its genre, and/or outlet of transmission (e.g. TV or film, free or pay-TV).  \n\n=====Free-to-air TV=====\nThe prevalence of media needing to be dubbed has resulted in a talent pool that is very capable of syncing voice to lip, especially for shows broadcast by the country's three largest networks. It is not uncommon in the Filipino dub industry to have most of the voices in a series dubbing by only a handful of voice talents. Programmes originally in English used to usually air in their original language on free-to-air television. \n\nSince the late 1990s/early 2000s, however, more originally English-language programmes that air on major free-to-air networks (i.e. 5, ABS-CBN, GMA) have been dubbed into Filipino. Even the former Studio 23 (now S+A), once known for its airing programmes in English, had adopted Filipino-language dubbing for some of its foreign programmes. Children's programmes from cable networks [[Nickelodeon]], [[Cartoon Network]], and [[Disney Channel]] shown on [[TV5 (Philippines)|5]], GMA, or ABS-CBN, have long been dubbed into Filipino or another Philippine regional language.  [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Animated Disney films]] are often dubbed in Filipino except for the singing scenes, which are shown in their original language (though in recent years, there has been an increase in number of Disney musicals having their songs also translated such as ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'').  [[GMA News TV]] airs some documentaries, movies, and reality series originally shown in the English language as dubbed in Filipino.  \n\nDubbing is less common in smaller free-to-air networks such as [[ETC (Philippine TV channel)|ETC]] and the former [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN 9]] (now CNN Philippines) whereby the original language version of the programme is aired. Dramas from Asia (particularly Greater China and Korea) and Latin America (called ''Asianovelas'', and ''Mexicanovelas'', respectively) have always been dubbed into Filipino or another Philippine regional language, and each programme from these genres feature their unique set of Filipino-speaking voice actors.\n\n=====Pay TV=====\nThe original language version of TV programmes is also usually available on cable/satellite channels such as [[Fox Life]], [[Fox Asia|Fox]], and AXN. However, some pay-TV channels specialise in showing foreign shows and films dubbed into Filipino. [[Cinema One]], ABS-CBN's cable movie channel, shows some films originally in non-English language dubbed into Filipino. [[Nat Geo Wild]] airs most programs dubbed into Filipino for Philippine audiences, being one of the few cable channels to do so. [[Tagalized Movie Channel|Tagalised Movie Channel]] & [[Tag (TV channel)|Tag]] airs Hollywood and Asian movies dubbed in Filipino. [[Fox Filipino]] airs some English, Latin, and Asian series dubbed in Filipino such as ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'', ''[[Devious Maids]]'', ''La Teniente'', ''Kdabra'', and some selected programs from [[Channel M (Southeast Asia)|Channel M]].  The defunct channel [[Hero (TV channel)|HERO TV]], which focuses on anime and [[tokusatsu]] shows and now a web portal, dubs all its foreign programs into Filipino. This is in contrast to Animax, where their anime programs are dubbed in English.\n\n=====Cinema=====\nForeign films, especially English films shown in local cinemas, are almost always shown in their original language.  Non-English foreign films make use of English subtitles. Unlike other countries, children's films originally in English are not dubbed in cinemas.\n\nA list of voice actors with their associates that they dub into Filipino are listed here.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Dubbing is rarely done with the other major Indian languages, namely [[Malayalam]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]], due to lack of significant market size. Despite this, some [[Kannada language|Kannada]] and [[Malayalam]] dubs of children television programs can be seen on the [[Sun TV Network|Sun TV]] channel. The dubbed versions are released into the towns and lower tier settlements of the respective states (where English penetration is low), often with the English-language originals released in the metropolitan areas. In all other states, the English originals are released along with the dubbed versions, where often the dubbed version collections are more outstanding than the originals. ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' was also done in the [[Bhojpuri language]], a language popular in [[East India|eastern India]] in addition to Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. ''[[A Good Day to Die Hard]]'', the most recent installment in the ''[[Die Hard (franchise)|Die Hard]]'' franchise, was the first ever Hollywood film to receive a [[Punjabi language|Punjabi language dub]] as well. \n\nMost TV channels mention neither the Indian-language dubbing credits, nor its staff, at the end of the original ending credits, since changing the credits casting for the original actors or voice actors involves a huge budget for modifying, making it somewhat difficult to find information for the dubbed versions. The same situation is encountered for films. Sometimes foreign programs and films receive more than one dub, such as for example, [[Jumanji]], [[Dragonheart]] and [[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]] having two Hindi dubs. Information for the Hindi, Tamil and Telugu voice actors who have done the voices for specific actors and for their roles on foreign films and television programs are published in local Indian data magazines, for those that are involved in the dubbing industry in India. But on a few occasions, there are some foreign productions that do credit the dubbing cast, such as animated films like the ''[[Barbie (film series)|Barbie]]'' films, and some Disney films. [[Disney Channel]] original series released on DVD with their Hindi dubs show a list of the artists in the Hindi dub credits, after the original ending credits. Theatrical releases and VCD releases of foreign films do not credit the dubbing cast or staff. The DVD releases, however, do have credits for the dubbing staff, if they are released multilingual. As of recently, information for the dubbing staff of foreign productions have been expanding due to high demands of people wanting to know the voice actors behind characters in foreign works. Large dubbing studios in India include [[Sound & Vision India]], [[Main Frame Software Communications]], [[Visual Reality]], [[ZamZam Productions]], [[Treasure Tower International]], [[Blue Whale Entertainment]], [[Jai Hand Entertainment]], [[Sugar Mediaz]] and [[Rudra Sound Solutionz]].\n\n====Pakistan====\nIn [[Pakistan]] \"foreign films\", and cartoons are not normally dubbed locally. Instead, foreign films, anime and cartoons, such as those shown on [[Nickelodeon Pakistan]] and [[Cartoon Network Pakistan]], are dubbed in [[Hindi]] in India, as Hindi and [[Urdu]], the national language of Pakistan, are [[mutually intelligible]].\nHowever, soap operas from [[Turkey]] are now dubbed in Urdu and have gained increased popularity at the expense of Indian soap operas in Hindi.<ref>[http://www.firstpost.com/living/in-pakistan-indian-soap-operas-give-way-to-turkish-serials-1260549.html In Pakistan, Indian soap operas give way to Turkish serials], ''[[First Post (India)|First Post]]'', 1 December 2013</ref> This has led to protests from local producers that these are a threat to Pakistan's television industry, with local productions being moved out of peak viewing time or dropped altogether.<ref>[http://www.dawn.com/news/772593/is-tv-drama-industry-overreacting-to-turkish-soaps-blitz Is TV drama industry overreacting to Turkish soaps blitz?], ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'', 20 December 2012</ref> Similarly, politicians leaders have expressed concerns over their content, given Turkey's less conservative culture.<ref>[http://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/10/the-geopolitics-of-soap-operas/ The Geopolitics of Soap Operas], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 10 January 2013</ref>\n\n====Vietnam====\nIn [[Vietnam]], foreign-language films and programs are subtitled on television in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. They were not dubbed until 1985, but are briefly translated with a speaker before commercial breaks. ''[[Rio (2011 film)|Rio]]'' was considered to be the very first American Hollywood film to be entirely dubbed in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]. Since then, children's films that came out afterwards have been released dubbed in theaters. [[HTV3]] has dubbed television programs for children, including ''[[Ben 10 (TV series)|Ben 10]]'', and ''[[Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide]]'', by using various voice actors to dub over the character roles.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHBlXxqhKwU |title=Ben 10 Vietnamese Trailer (Trailer Ben 10 - HTV3) |publisher=YouTube |date=18 October 2011 |accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WbgyJP5-TA |title=HTV3 - C\u1ea9m Nang C\u1ee7a Ned - Trailer |publisher=YouTube |date=10 August 2012 |accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nSooner afterwards, more programs started to get dubbed. HTV3 also offers anime dubbed into Vietnamese. [[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|Pok\u00e9mon]] got a Vietnamese dub in early 2014 on HTV3 starting with the Best Wishes series. But due to a controversy regarding Pok\u00e9mon's cries being re-dubbed despite that all characters had their Japanese names, it was switched to [[VTV2]] in September 2015 when the XY series debut. [[Sailor Moon (anime)|Sailor Moon]] also recently has been dubbed for HTV3 in early 2015.\n\n====Singapore====\nIn multilingual [[Singapore]], dubbing is rare for western programmes. English-language programmes on the free-to-air terrestrial channels are usually subtitled in Chinese or Malay. Chinese, Malay and Tamil programmes (except for news bulletins), usually have subtitles in English and the original language during the prime time hours. [[Dual sound]] programs, such as Korean and Japanese dramas, offer sound in the original languages with subtitles, Mandarin-dubbed and subtitled, or English-dubbed. The [[Speak Mandarin Campaign|deliberate policy to encourage Mandarin]] among citizens made it required by law for programs in other Chinese dialects ([[Min Nan|Hokkien]], Cantonese and [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]]) to be dubbed into Mandarin, with the exception of traditional [[opera]]s. Cantonese and Hokkien shows from Hong Kong and Taiwan, respectively, are available on VCD and DVD. In a recent development, news bulletins are subtitled.\n\n====Iran====\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n[[File:Iranian Dubbing artists.jpg|thumb|A group of Iranian dubbing artists]]\nIn [[Iran]], foreign films and television programs are dubbed in [[Persian language|Persian]]. Dubbing began in 1946 with the advent of movies and cinemas in the country. Since then, foreign movies have always been dubbed for the cinema and TV. Using various voice actors and adding local hints and witticisms to the original contents, dubbing played a major role in attracting people to the cinemas and developing an interest in other cultures. The dubbing art in Iran reached its apex during the 1960s and 1970s with the inflow of American, European and Hindi movies.\n\nThe most famous musicals of the time, such as ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' and ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', were translated, adjusted and performed in Persian by the voice artists. Since the 1990s, for political reasons and under pressure from the state, the dubbing industry has declined, with movies dubbed only for the state TV channels. During recent years, DVDs with Persian subtitles have found a market among viewers for the same reason, but most people still prefer the Persian-speaking dubbed versions. Recently, privately operated companies started dubbing TV series by hiring famous dubbers.\n\nA list of Persian voice actors that associate with their actor counterparts are listed here.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

There are exceptions, such as some children's cartoons.\n\n====Azerbaijan====\nIn [[Azerbaijan]], dubbing is rare, as most Azerbaijani channels such as [[G\u00fcn\u0259\u015f TV|ARB G\u00fcn\u0259\u015f]] air [[voice-over]]s or Azerbaijan originals.\n\n====Western Asia====\nSee [[#North Africa, Western Asia|below]].\n\n===Africa===\n====North Africa, Western Asia====\nIn [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], and Tunisia, most foreign movies (especially Hollywood productions) are shown dubbed in French. These movies are usually imported directly from French film distributors. The choice of movies dubbed into French can be explained by the widespread use of the French language. Another important factor is that local theaters and private media companies do not dub in local languages in order to avoid high costs, but also because of the lack of both expertise and demand.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, dubbed series and movies for children in [[Modern Standard Arabic]] became a popular choice among most TV channels, cinemas and VHS/DVD stores. However, dubbed films are still imported, and dubbing is performed in the [[Levant]] countries with a strong tradition of dubbing (mainly [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Jordan]]).\n\nIn the Arabic-speaking countries, some children shows (mainly cartoons) are dubbed in Arabic, otherwise Arabic subtitles are used. The only exception was [[telenovelas]] dubbed in Standard Arabic, or dialects, but also Turkish series, most notably [[G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015f (TV series)|G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015f]], in Syrian Arabic.\n\nAn example of Arabic voice actors that dub for certain performers is Safi Mohammed for [[Elijah Wood]].\n\nIn [[Tunisia]], the Tunisia National Television (TNT), the public broadcaster of Tunisia, is not allowed to show any content in any language other than Arabic, which forces it to broadcast only dubbed content (this restriction was recently removed for commercials). During the 1970s and 1980s, TNT (known as ERTT at the time) started dubbing famous cartoons in Tunisian and Standard Arabic. However, in the private sector, television channels are not subject to the language rule.\n\n====South Africa====\nIn [[South Africa]], many television programmes were dubbed in [[Afrikaans]], with the original soundtrack (usually in English, but sometimes [[Dutch language|Dutch]] or [[German language|German]]) \"[[simulcast]]\" in [[FM stereo#Stereo FM|FM stereo]] on [[Radio 2000]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-NRDAQAAIAAJ&dq=was+simulcast++Radio+2000+afrikaans&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Radio+2000+afrikaans ''The voice, the vision: a sixty year history of the South African Broadcasting Corporation''], Malcolm Theunissen, Victor Nikitin, Melanie Pillay, Advent Graphics, 1996, page 120</ref> These included US series such as ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'', ''(Steve Austin: Die Man van Staal)''<ref>[http://www.tvsa.co.za/mastershowinfo.asp?mastershowid=2293 The Six Million Dollar Man], TVSA - The South African TV Authority</ref> ''[[Miami Vice]]'' ''(Misdaad in Miami)'',<ref>{{cite news |title=Shows Allow Blacks, Whites to Share Cultural Experiences : South African Viewers Get a Mixed TV Message From U.S. Programs |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1986-05-25/news/mn-7271_1_south-african |accessdate=14 August 2012 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=25 May 1986|author=GLENN FRANKEL (from ''The Washington Post'')}}</ref> ''[[Beverly Hills 90210]]'',<ref>[http://mg.co.za/article/1996-02-09-the-critics-thumbs-up/ The critics' thumbs-up], ''[[Mail & Guardian]]'', 9 February 1996</ref> and the German detective series ''[[Derrick (TV series)|Derrick]]''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7h1DAQAAIAAJ&dq=derrick+tv+series+afrikaans&q=derrick+|title=Mass Media, Towards the Millennium|isbn=9780627023248|accessdate=9 July 2015|last1=Beer|first1=Arrie De|year=1998}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the [[boycott]] by the [[United Kingdom|British]] actors' union [[Equity (trade union)|Equity]], which banned the sale of most British television programmes, the [[puppet]] series ''[[The Adventures of Rupert Bear]]'' was dubbed into [[South African English]], as the original voices had been recorded by Equity voice artists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://upetd.up.ac.za/thesis/available/etd-05212009-182219/unrestricted/07chapter7.pdf |last=Bevan |first=C |year=2008 |title=Putting up screens: A history of television in South Africa, 1929-1976, MHCS dissertation, University of Pretoria, Pretoria |accessdate=1 January 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215155949/http://upetd.up.ac.za/thesis/available/etd-05212009-182219/unrestricted/07chapter7.pdf |archivedate=15 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nThis practice has declined as a result of the reduction of airtime for the language on [[SABC]] TV, and the increase of locally produced material in Afrikaans on other channels like [[KykNet]]. Similarly, many programmes, such as ''[[The Jeffersons]]'', were dubbed into [[Zulu language|Zulu]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Lelyveld |first=Joseph |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/22/magazine/22SAFR.html?&pagewanted=all |title=South Africa: Dream and Reality |work=The New York Times Magazine |date=22 September 1985 |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref> but this has also declined as local drama production has increased. However, some animated films, such as ''[[Maya the Bee]]'', have been dubbed in both Afrikaans and Zulu by local artists.<ref>[http://www.channel24.co.za/Movies/News/Maya-the-Bee-flick-dubbed-into-Afrikaans-and-Zulu-for-SA-audience-20150910 Maya the Bee flick dubbed into Afrikaans and Zulu for SA audience], [[News24|Channel24]], 18 September 2015</ref>\n\n====Uganda====\nUganda's [[Cinema of Uganda|own film industry]] is fairly small, and foreign movies are commonly watched. The English sound track is often accompanied by the [[Luganda]] translation and comments, provided by an Ugandan \"video jockey\" (VJ). VJ's interpreting and narration may be available in a recorded form or live.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/baobab/2012/11/cinema-uganda |title=Coming to you live\n|date=2 November 2012|journal=The Economist|first=M|last=H}}</ref>\n\n===Oceania===\nIn common with other English-speaking countries, there has traditionally been little dubbing in [[Australia]], with foreign language television programmes and films being shown (usually on [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]]) with subtitles or English dubs produced in other countries. This has also been the case in [[New Zealand]], but the [[M\u0101ori Television Service]], launched in 2004, has dubbed animated films into [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]].<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10117134 Maori TV broadens horizons], ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', 26 March 2005</ref> However, some TV commercials from foreign countries are dubbed, even if the original commercial came from another English-speaking country.  Moreover, the off-screen narration portions of some non-fiction programmes originating from the UK or North America are re-dubbed by Australian voice talents to relay information in expressions that Australians can understand more easily.\n\n==Alternatives==\n===Subtitles===\n{{Main|Subtitle}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\n[[Subtitle (captioning)|Subtitles]] can be used instead of dubbing, as different countries have different traditions regarding the choice between dubbing and subtitling. On [[DVD]]s with higher translation budgets, the option for both types will often be provided to account for individual preferences; [[Purism|purists]] often demand subtitles. For small markets (small language area or films for a select audience), subtitling is more suitable, because it is cheaper. In the case of films for small children who cannot yet read, or do not read fast enough, dubbing is necessary.\n\nIn most [[English language|English]]-speaking countries, dubbing is comparatively rare. In [[Israel]], some programmes need to be comprehensible to speakers of both [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. This cannot be accomplished with dubbing, so subtitling is much more commonplace\u2014sometimes even with subtitles in multiple languages, with the soundtrack remaining in the original language, usually English. The same applies to certain television shows in [[Finland]], where [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] are both official languages.\n\nIn the [[Netherlands]], [[Flanders]], [[Nordic countries]], [[Estonia]] and [[Portugal]], films and television programmes are shown in the original language (usually English) with subtitles, and only cartoons and children's movies and programs are dubbed, such as the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series, ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', ''[[Shrek]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' and others. Cinemas usually show both a dubbed version and one with subtitles for this kind of movie, with the subtitled version shown later in the evening.\n\nIn Portugal, one terrestrial channel, [[TVI (Portugal)|TVI]], dubbed U.S. series like ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' into [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref name=\"DCpt\">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3sKswU7k_I |title=Dawson's Creek PT |last=Somnorte |date=6 December 2008 |via=YouTube}}</ref> RTP also transmitted ''[[Friends]]'' in a dubbed version, but it was poorly received and later re-aired in a subtitled version. Cartoons, on the other hand, are usually dubbed, sometimes by well-known actors, even on TV. Animated movies are usually released to the cinemas in both subtitled and dubbed versions.\n\nIn [[Argentina]] and [[Venezuela]], terrestrial channels air films and TV series in a dubbed version, as demanded by law. However, those same series can be seen on cable channels at more accessible time-slots in their subtitled version and usually before they are shown on open TV. In contrast, the series ''The Simpsons'' is aired in its Mexican Spanish-dubbed version both on terrestrial television and on the cable station Fox, which broadcasts the series for the area. Although the first season of the series appeared with subtitles, this was not continued for the following seasons.\n\n===Dubbing and subtitling===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nIn [[Bulgaria]], television series are dubbed, but most television channels use subtitles for action and drama movies. [[AXN]] uses subtitles for its series, but as of 2008 emphasises dubbing. Only [[Diema]] channels dub all programs. Movies in theaters, with the exception of films for children, use dubbing and subtitles. Dubbing of television programs is usually done using voiceovers, but usually, voices professional actors, while trying to give each character a different voice by using appropriate intonations. Dubbing with synchronised voices is rarely used, mostly for animated films. ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'' is a rare example of a feature film dubbed this way on [[BNT Channel 1]], though a subtitled version is currently shown on other channels.\n\n[[Walt Disney Television]]'s animated series (such as ''[[DuckTales]]'', ''[[Darkwing Duck]]'', and ''[[Timon & Pumbaa (TV series)|Timon & Pumbaa]]'') were only aired with synchronised Bulgarian voices on [[BNT Channel 1]] until 2005, but then the Disney shows were canceled. When airing of Disney series resumed on [[Nova Television (Bulgaria)|Nova Television]] and [[Jetix]] in 2008, voiceovers were used, but Disney animated-movie translations still use synchronised voices. Voiceover dubbing is not used in theatrical releases. The Bulgarian film industry law requires all children's films to be dubbed, not subtitled. [[Nova Television (Bulgaria)|Nova Television]] dubbed and aired the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' anime with synchronised voices. Now, the show is airing on Disney Channel, also in a synchronised form.\n\n[[Netflix]] provides both subtitles and dubbed audio with its foreign language shows, including Brazil's dystopian \u201c[[3%]]\u201d and the German thriller \"[[Dark (TV series)|Dark]]\". Viewer testing indicates that its audience is more likely to finish watching a series if they select to view it with dubbed audio rather than translated subtitles. Netflix now streams its foreign language content with dubbed audio as default in an effort to increase viewer retention.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/netflix-success-secrets-1202721847/|title=Netflix's Secrets to Success: Six Cell Towers, Dubbing and More|last=Roettgers|first=Janko|date=8 March 2018|work=Variety|access-date=7 November 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==General use==\nDubbing is also used in applications and genres other than traditional film, including video games, television, and pornographic films.\n\n===Video games===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nMany [[video game]]s originally produced in [[North America]], [[Japan]], and [[PAL]] countries are dubbed into foreign languages for release in areas such as [[Europe]] and [[Australia]], especially for video games that place a heavy emphasis on dialogue. Because characters' mouth movements can be part of the game's code, [[lip sync]] is sometimes achieved by re-coding the mouth movements to match the dialogue in the new language. The [[Source engine]] automatically generates lip-sync data, making it easier for games to be localised.\n\nTo achieve synchronisation when animations are intended only for the source language, localised content is mostly recorded using techniques borrowed from movie dubbing (such as rythmo band) or, when images are not available, localised dubbing is done using source audios as a reference. Sound-synch is a method where localised audios are recorded matching the length and internal pauses of the source content.<!-- What does this last sentence mean? -->\n\nFor the European version of a video game, the on-screen text of the game is available in various languages and, in many cases, the dialogue is dubbed into each respective language, as well.\n\nThe North American version of any game is always available in [[English language|English]], with translated text and dubbed dialogue, if necessary, in other languages, especially if the North American version of the game contains the same data as the European version. Several Japanese games, such as those in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', ''[[Dynasty Warriors]]'', and ''[[Soul (series)|Soul]]'' series, are released with both the original Japanese audio and the English dub included.\n\n===Television===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nDubbing is occasionally used on [[network television]] broadcasts of films that contain dialogue that the network executives or [[Censorship|censors]] have decided to replace. This is usually done to remove [[profanity]]. In most cases, the original actor does not perform this duty, but an actor with a similar voice reads the changes. The results are sometimes seamless, but, in many cases, the voice of the replacement actor sounds nothing like the original performer, which becomes particularly noticeable when extensive dialogue must be replaced. Also, often easy to notice, is the sudden absence of background sounds in the movie during the dubbed dialogue. Among the films considered notorious for using substitute actors that sound very different from their theatrical counterparts are the ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'' and the ''[[Die Hard series|Die Hard]]'' film series, as shown on broadcasters such as [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]]. In the case of ''Smokey and the Bandit'', extensive dubbing was done for the first network airing on [[ABC Television]] in 1978, especially for [[Jackie Gleason]]'s character, [[Buford T. Justice]]. The dubbing of his phrase \"sombitch\" (son of a bitch) became \"scum bum,\" which became a catchphrase of the time.\n\nDubbing is commonly used in [[science fiction television]], as well. Sound generated by effects equipment such as [[Animatronics|animatronic]] puppets or by actors' movements on elaborate multi-level plywood sets (for example, starship bridges or other command centers) will quite often make the original character dialogue unusable. ''[[Stargate]]'' and ''[[Farscape]]'' are two prime examples where ADR is used heavily to produce usable audio.\n\nSince some anime series contain profanity, the studios recording the English dubs often re-record certain lines if a series or movie is going to be broadcast on [[Cartoon Network]], removing references to [[death]] and [[hell]] as well. Some companies will offer both an edited and an uncut version of the series on DVD, so that there is an edited script available in case the series is broadcast. Other companies also edit the full-length version of a series, meaning that even on the uncut DVD characters say things like \"Blast!\" and \"Darn!\" in place of the original dialogue's profanity. [[Bandai|Bandai Entertainment's]] English dub of ''[[G Gundam]]'' is infamous for this, among many other things, with such lines as \"Bartender, more milk\".\n\nDubbing has also been used for comedic purposes, replacing lines of dialogue to create comedies from footage that was originally another genre. Examples include the Australian shows ''[[The Late Show (1990s Australian TV series)#The Olden Days|The Olden Days]]'' and ''[[Bargearse]]'', re-dubbed from 1970s Australian drama and action series, respectively, the Irish show ''[[Soupy Norman]]'', re-dubbed from ''[[:pl:Pierwsza mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107|Pierwsza mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107]]'', a Polish soap opera, and ''[[Most Extreme Elimination Challenge]]'', a comedic dub of the Japanese show ''[[Takeshi's Castle]]''.\n\nDubbing into a foreign language does not always entail the deletion of the original language. In some countries, a performer may read the translated dialogue as a voice-over. This often occurs in [[Russia]] and [[Poland]], where \"lektories\" or \"lektors\" read the translated dialogue into [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Polish language|Polish]]. In Poland, one announcer read all text. However, this is done almost exclusively for the television and home video markets, while theatrical releases are usually subtitled. Recently, however, the number of high-quality, fully dubbed films has increased, especially for children's movies. If a quality dubbed version exists for a film, it is shown in theaters. However, some films, such as ''[[Harry Potter]]'' or ''[[Star Wars]]'', are shown in both dubbed and subtitled versions, varying with the time of the show. Such films are also shown on TV (although some channels drop them and do standard one-narrator translation) and VHS/DVD. In other countries, like [[Vietnam]], the voice-over technique is also used for theatrical releases.<!-- This section and the next one are redundant. This material has already been covered and should be merged above. -->\n\nIn Russia, the reading of all lines by a single person is referred to as a [[Gavrilov translation]], and is generally found only in [[Copyright infringement|illegal copies]] of films and on [[cable television]]. Professional copies always include at least two actors of opposite gender translating the dialogue. Some titles in Poland have been dubbed this way, too, but this method lacks public appeal, so it is very rare now.\n\nOn special occasions, such as [[film festival]]s, live [[interpreting]] is often done by professionals.\n\n===Pornography===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}\nAs budgets for [[pornographic film]]s are often small, compared to films made by major studios, and there is an inherent need to film without interrupting filming, it is common for sex scenes to be over-dubbed. The audio for such over-dubbing is generally referred to as ''the Ms and Gs'', or ''the moans and groans.''\n\n==Dubbing into varieties==\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2013}}\nIn the case of languages with large communities (such as [[English language|English]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], or [[French language|French]]), a single translation may sound foreign to native speakers in a given region. Therefore, a film may be translated into a certain variety of a certain language. For example, the animated movie ''[[The Incredibles]]'' was translated to [[European Spanish]], [[Mexican Spanish]], [[Neutral Spanish]] (which is Mexican Spanish but avoids colloquialisms), and [[Rioplatense Spanish]] (although people from [[Chile]] and [[Uruguay]] noticed a strong ''[[porte\u00f1o]]'' accent from most of the characters of the Rioplatense Spanish translation).{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} In [[List of countries where Spanish is an official language|Spanish-speaking regions]], most media is dubbed twice: into European Spanish and Neutral Spanish.\n\nAnother example is the French dubbing of ''The Simpsons'', which has two entirely different versions for [[Quebec]] and for [[France]]. The humor is very different for each audience (see [[Non-English versions of The Simpsons|Non-English versions of ''The Simpsons'']]). Audiences in Quebec are generally critical of France's dubbing of ''The Simpsons'', which they often do not find amusing.\n\n[[Quebec French|Quebec-French]] dubbing of films is generally made in accent-free [[Standard French]], but may sound peculiar to audiences in France because of the persistence of some regionally-neutral expressions and because Quebec-French performers pronounce Anglo-Saxon names with an American accent, unlike French performers. Occasionally, budget restraints cause American [[direct-to-video]] films, such as the 1995 film ''When the Bullet Hits the Bone'', to be released in France with a Quebec-French dubbing, sometimes resulting in what some members of French audiences perceive as unintentional humor.\n\n[[Portugal]] and [[Brazil]] also use different versions of dubbed films and series. Because dubbing has never been very popular in [[Portugal]], for decades, children's films were distributed using the higher-quality Brazilian dub (unlike children's TV series, which are traditionally dubbed in European Portuguese). Only in the 1990s did dubbing begin to gain popularity in Portugal. ''[[The Lion King]]'' became the first Disney feature film to be completely dubbed into [[European Portuguese]], and subsequently all major animation films gained European-Portuguese versions. In recent [[DVD]] releases, most Brazilian-Portuguese-dubbed classics were released with new European-Portuguese dubs, eliminating the predominance of Brazilian-Portuguese dubs in Portugal.\n\nSimilarly, in the [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking region of [[Flanders]], [[Belgium]], cartoons are often dubbed locally by [[Flemish]] artists{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} rather than using soundtracks produced in the [[Netherlands]].\n\nThe [[list of territorial entities where German is an official language|German-speaking region]], which includes [[Germany]], [[Austria]], part of [[Switzerland]], and [[Liechtenstein]], share a common German-dubbed version of films and shows. Although there are some differences in the three major German varieties, all films, shows, and series are dubbed into a single [[Standard German]] version that avoids regional variations in the German-speaking audience. Most voice actors are primarily German or Austrian. Switzerland, which has four official languages (German, French, [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Romansh language|Romansh]]), generally uses dubbed versions made in each respective country (except for Romansh). Liechtenstein uses German-dubbed versions only.\n\nSometimes, films are also dubbed into several [[German dialects]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} ([[Berlinerisch]], [[Colognian language|K\u00f6lsch]], [[Saxonian]], [[Austro-Bavarian language|Austro-Bavarian]] or [[Swiss German]]), especially animated films and Disney films. They are as an additional \"special feature\" to entice the audience into buying it. Popular animated films dubbed into German variety include ''[[Asterix]]'' films (in addition to its Standard German version, every film has a particular variety version), ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'',{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} ''[[Shrek 2]]'',{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', (+ Austrian German){{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} and ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OBS_20090810_OBS0008 |title=\u00d6sterreich-Version von Disney/Pixars \"Oben\" mit Otto Schenk und Karlheinz B\u00f6hm - BILD |language=de |publisher=ots.at |date=10 August 2009 |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref> (+ Austrian German).\n\nSome live-action films or TV-series have an additional German variety dubbing: ''[[Babe (film)|Babe]]'' and its sequel, ''[[Babe: Pig in the City]]'' (German German, Austrian German, Swiss German); and ''[[Rehearsal for Murder]]'', ''[[Framed (TV series)|Framed]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://215072.homepagemodules.de/topic-threaded.php?forum=11776730&threaded=1&id=506508&message=6643629 |title=Allgemeines \" ORF-Synchronisationen - Wer wei\u00df was? |publisher=215072.homepagemodules.de |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref> (+ Austrian German); ''[[The Munsters]]'', ''[[Serpico]]'', ''[[Rumpole]]'' (+ Austrian German), and ''[[The Thorn Birds]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://215072.homepagemodules.de/topic-threaded.php?forum=11776728&threaded=1&id=506269&message=7100872 |title=Serien \" 24 |publisher=215072.homepagemodules.de |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref>\n(only Austrian German dubbing).\n\nBefore [[German reunification]], [[East Germany]] also made its own particular German version. For example, ''[[Olsen-banden|Olsen Gang]]'' and the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] animated series ''[[The M\u00e9zga Family]]'' were dubbed in [[West Germany]] as well as East Germany.\n\nUsually, there are two dubbings produced in [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]: [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. Serbian for [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]; Croatian for [[Croatia]] and parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n==Criticism==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}\n\nWhile the voice actors involved usually bear the brunt of criticisms towards poor dubbing, other factors may include inaccurate script translation and poor [[Audio mixing (television and film)|audio mixing]]. Dialogue typically contains speech patterns and sentence structure that are natural to the original language but would appear awkward if translated literally. English dubs of Japanese animation, for example, must rewrite the dialogue so that it flows smoothly while following the natural pattern of English speech. On some occasions, voice actors record their dialogue individually instead of with the rest of the cast, and their performances can lack the dynamics gained from performing as a group.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nMany [[martial arts]] movies from [[Hong Kong]] that were imported under the unofficial banner [[Kung Fu Theater]] were notorious{{according to whom|date=June 2019}} for seemingly careless dubbing that included poor lip sync and awkward dialogue. Since the results were frequently unintentionally humorous, it has become one of the hallmarks that endear these films to fans of the 1980s culture.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{commons category|Dubbing (filmmaking)}}\n*{{Cite book |last1=Maluf |first1=Ramez |title=Dubbing into Arabic: A Trojan Horse at the Gates? |url=http://inhouse.lau.edu.lb/bima/papers/Dubbing.pdf |accessdate=10 April 2011 |date=19 December 2003 |publisher=[[Lebanese American University]]}}\n*Di Fortunato E. e Paolinelli M.

He also holds the second-highest individual score by a South African batsman, with 278 (not out). Until 2012 he was an occasional [[wicket-keeper]] for South Africa, although after the retirement of regular Test keeper [[Mark Boucher]] and under his own captaincy he has started to regularly keep wicket for the national side in Tests, ODIs and T20Is. He gave up wicket-keeping in 2015 and handed the gloves to [[debutant]] [[Quinton de Kock]].\n\nHe holds the records for the fastest 50 (16 balls), 100 (31 balls) and 150 (64 balls) of all time in One Day Internationals by any batsmen, and also holds the fastest hundred by a South African in Tests and the fastest 50 by South African in T20Is. He is a three-time ICC ODI player of the year, winning the award in 2010, 2014 and 2015.\n\nAfter the [[2011 Cricket World Cup]] he succeeded [[Graeme Smith]] as captain of the national ODI side, and became Test captain after the second Test of the [[English cricket team in South Africa in 2015\u201316|home series against England in 2015/16]]. He stepped down from Test captaincy in December 2016 due to an elbow injury which kept him out of the team for a long period.\n\n==International career==\n[[File:AB de villiers (cropped).jpg|thumb|252px|De Villiers in 2006]]\n\n===Early career===\nAfter a spell in the South Africa U19 team, he made his debut for the Titans in 2003/4.\n\nHe made his Test debut as a 20-year-old on 16 December 2004 against England at Port Elizabeth. He made a strong impression opening the batting, but was dropped down the order for the second Test and also handed the wicket-keeping gloves. In this match, he made a match-saving half-century from number seven. However, he found himself at the top of the order again for the final Test of the series.\n\nDespite a good tour of the Caribbean where he scored 178 to help South Africa seal a Test series win, his rapid progress was slowed on the [[South African cricket team in Australia in 2005-06|tour of Australia]] in 2005. Despite playing [[Shane Warne]] well and becoming the second-youngest and second-fastest South African to reach 1,000 Test runs after [[Graeme Pollock]], he struggled and made just 152 runs in 6 innings.\n\nHe has been used in a similar fashion to [[Jonty Rhodes]] in ODIs, opening the innings, although he currently bats in the middle order. De Villiers gave the selectors a sign by producing his then highest one-day score of 92 not out, which included 12 fours and one six, from 98 balls against India in the 2006 winter series.\n\nDe Villiers had a reputation as an outstanding fielder, typified by a diving run-out of [[Simon Katich]] of Australia in 2006, when he dived to stop the ball, and while still lying on his stomach facing away from the stumps, he tossed the ball backwards over his shoulder and effected a direct hit. This has also led people to make further comparisons of him to Jonty Rhodes, who was also one of the finest fielders of his generation. His fielding positions other than wicket-keeper are 1st and 2nd slip and cover.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH8KrkRYIQA |title=Ponting's Top Five fielders of all time |author=Cricket.com.au |date=21 May 2017 |website=YouTube |accessdate=27 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===2007 Cricket World Cup in West Indies===\nCompeting in the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]], AB was in good form in ODIs having scored four 50s during the South Africa vs India/Pakistan (2007) matches.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn the early stages of the tournament AB's form was poor with three failures including a duck against the [[Netherlands national cricket team|Netherlands]] in a match where his team broke various records for batting,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wc2007/content/story/285626.html?object=247462 |title=Gibbs sets records galore |first1=S. |last1=Rajesh |first2=H.

This was followed by a 97 at [[The Oval]] before he came down the wicket trying to smash [[Monty Panesar]] for a boundary and was caught on the fence.\n\nIn the first Test in Perth, De Villiers scored a match-winning century to help South Africa chase down the second-highest-ever fourth innings target of 414 with six wickets in hand. This was South Africa's first Test victory in Australia in 15 years and appeared to go a long way towards tilting world cricket's balance of power after over a decade of Australian dominance.

But in the second innings he made only 3 off 7.\n\nIn the third Test, after centuries from [[Ashwell Prince]] and Jacques Kallis, De Villiers was the third centurion of the innings with a score of 163 off 196 balls with 12 fours and 7 sixes. This knock also tied the record for most sixes in an over as De Villiers, off the bowling of McDonald, hit four consecutive sixes.\n\nIn the following 5-game ODI series, De Villiers played consistently, although starting badly in the first game, scoring only 2 runs. However, he went on to make 36*, 80, 84 and 38 and was named Player of the Series at the conclusion of game 5.\n\nHe was rested for the two-match Twenty20 series against Zimbabwe and because [[Mark Boucher]] was injured as well [[Heino Kuhn]] donned the keeping gloves.

In the first match, he was out for a second-ball duck off a superb delivery by [[Shoaib Akhtar]]. In the second T20I he scored 11 runs. He then participated in the five-match ODI series where South Africa were chasing 203 to win and he scored 51 before he was caught and bowled by Saeed Ajmal. In the second ODI he scored 29 as he was bowled by [[Shahid Afridi]]; in the same match, a flamboyant [[Abdul Razzaq (cricketer)|Abdul Razzaq]] played the greatest innings of his life to lift Pakistan to an unbelievable victory. During the third match, he scored 19 before he was stumped by [[Zulqarnain Haider]]. It turned out to be a mistake by the umpire as he had pressed the wrong button. In the fourth match, he missed out on a half-century while on 49 when he gave his wicket to the fielder at point.

February 1984), is a South African cricketer.

His name was also featured in Wisden Cricketers of the Decade at the end of 2019.\n\nDe Villiers began his international career as a wicket-keeper-batsman, but he has played most often solely as a batsman. He batted at various positions in the batting order, but predominantly in the middle-order. Noted as one of the most innovative and destructive batsmen in the modern era, De Villiers is known for a range of unorthodox shots, particularly behind the wicket-keeper.<ref name=absuperman>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/ab-de-villiers-retires-what-made-mr-360-a-modern-day-great-1239718-2018-05-23 |title=AB de Villiers retires: What made Mr. 360 a modern-day great |last=Sen |first=Rohan |date=23 May 2018 |magazine=[[India Today]] |access-date=9 September 2018}}</ref> \n\nHe made his international debut in a [[Test cricket|Test match]] against England in 2004 and first played a [[One Day International]] (ODI) in early 2005. His debut in [[Twenty20 International]] cricket came in 2006. He scored over 8,000 [[Run (cricket)|runs]] in both Test and ODI cricket and is one of the very few batsmen to have a [[batting average (cricket)|batting average]] of over fifty in both forms of the game.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/23581884/ab-de-villiers-genius-two-formats |title=AB de Villiers: A genius in two formats |last1=Rajesh |first1=S. |last2=Jayaraman |first2=Shiva |date=23 May 2018 |website=[[ESPNcricinfo]] |access-date=24 May 2018}}</ref> He holds the record for the fastest ODI century in just 31 balls.

He also holds the second-highest individual score by a South African batsman, with 278 (not out). Until 2012 he was an occasional [[wicket-keeper]] for South Africa, although after the retirement of regular Test keeper [[Mark Boucher]] and under his own captaincy he has started to regularly keep wicket for the national side in Tests, ODIs and T20Is. He gave up wicket-keeping in 2015 and handed the gloves to [[debutant]] [[Quinton de Kock]].\n\nHe holds the records for the fastest 50 (16 balls), 100 (31 balls) and 150 (64 balls) of all time in One Day Internationals by any batsmen, and also holds the fastest hundred by a South African in Tests and the fastest 50 by South African in T20Is. He is a three-time ICC ODI player of the year, winning the award in 2010, 2014 and 2015.\n\nAfter the [[2011 Cricket World Cup]] he succeeded [[Graeme Smith]] as captain of the national ODI side, and became Test captain after the second Test of the [[English cricket team in South Africa in 2015\u201316|home series against England in 2015/16]]. He stepped down from Test captaincy in December 2016 due to an elbow injury which kept him out of the team for a long period.\n\n==International career==\n[[File:AB de villiers (cropped).jpg|thumb|252px|De Villiers in 2006]]\n\n===Early career===\nAfter a spell in the South Africa U19 team, he made his debut for the Titans in 2003/4.\n\nHe made his Test debut as a 20-year-old on 16 December 2004 against England at Port Elizabeth. He made a strong impression opening the batting, but was dropped down the order for the second Test and also handed the wicket-keeping gloves. In this match, he made a match-saving half-century from number seven. However, he found himself at the top of the order again for the final Test of the series.\n\nDespite a good tour of the Caribbean where he scored 178 to help South Africa seal a Test series win, his rapid progress was slowed on the [[South African cricket team in Australia in 2005-06|tour of Australia]] in 2005. Despite playing [[Shane Warne]] well and becoming the second-youngest and second-fastest South African to reach 1,000 Test runs after [[Graeme Pollock]], he struggled and made just 152 runs in 6 innings.\n\nHe has been used in a similar fashion to [[Jonty Rhodes]] in ODIs, opening the innings, although he currently bats in the middle order. De Villiers gave the selectors a sign by producing his then highest one-day score of 92 not out, which included 12 fours and one six, from 98 balls against India in the 2006 winter series.\n\nDe Villiers had a reputation as an outstanding fielder, typified by a diving run-out of [[Simon Katich]] of Australia in 2006, when he dived to stop the ball, and while still lying on his stomach facing away from the stumps, he tossed the ball backwards over his shoulder and effected a direct hit. This has also led people to make further comparisons of him to Jonty Rhodes, who was also one of the finest fielders of his generation. His fielding positions other than wicket-keeper are 1st and 2nd slip and cover.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH8KrkRYIQA |title=Ponting's Top Five fielders of all time |author=Cricket.com.au |date=21 May 2017 |website=YouTube |accessdate=27 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===2007 Cricket World Cup in West Indies===\nCompeting in the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]], AB was in good form in ODIs having scored four 50s during the South Africa vs India/Pakistan (2007) matches.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn the early stages of the tournament AB's form was poor with three failures including a duck against the [[Netherlands national cricket team|Netherlands]] in a match where his team broke various records for batting,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wc2007/content/story/285626.html?object=247462 |title=Gibbs sets records galore |first1=S. |last1=Rajesh |first2=H.

He had to bat with a runner for the latter stages of his innings and found every shot painful due to a combination of cramps, heat exhaustion and dehydration.{{citation needed |date=May 2016}} His innings consisted of a second wicket partnership of 170 with [[Jacques Kallis]] and a third wicket partnership of 70 with [[Herschelle Gibbs]]. De Villiers' innings helped set up a total of 356/4 from 50 overs.\n\nHis batting during the World Cup was inconsistent as he also [[Duck (cricket)|failed to score]] on 4 occasions, itself a record.<ref name=\"stats.ODI\">{{cite web |url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/44936.html?class=2;template=results;trophy=12;type=batting;view=innings |title=Statistics: AB De Villiers One-Day Internationals |website=ESPNcricinfo |access-date=17 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Gaining attention===\nOn 4 April 2008, De Villiers became the first South African to score a [[double century]] against [[India national cricket team|India]] with his top score of 217.\n\nDe Villiers scored an obdurate 174 that helped set up a ten-wicket win for South Africa in the second Test against England at Headingley Carnegie in Leeds in July 2008. This was followed by a 97 at [[The Oval]] before he came down the wicket trying to smash [[Monty Panesar]] for a boundary and was caught on the fence.\n\nIn the first Test in Perth, De Villiers scored a match-winning century to help South Africa chase down the second-highest-ever fourth innings target of 414 with six wickets in hand. This was South Africa's first Test victory in Australia in 15 years and appeared to go a long way towards tilting world cricket's balance of power after over a decade of Australian dominance.

Some people use [[standing desk]]s to be able to stand while using them.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"desk\" originated from the Modern Latin word ''desca'' \"table to write on\", from the mid 14th century.<ref name=etymonline>{{cite web| url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=help+desk/|title=Desk|publisher= Online Etymology |accessdate=2012-05-17}}</ref> It is a modification of the Old Italian ''desco'' \"table\", from Latin ''discus'' \"dish\" or \"disc\".<ref name=MerriamWebster/> The word desk has been used figuratively since 1797.<ref name=etymonline/> A desk may also be known as a bureau, counter, [[davenport desk|davenport]], [[escritoire]], [[lectern]], reading stand, [[rolltop desk]], school desk, workspace, or [[writing desk]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://thesaurus.com/browse/desk+?s=t/|title=Desk |publisher=Thesaurus.com|accessdate=2012-05-17}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Yokeback armchair and painting table, Ming dynasty, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|Chinese editing desk of the 12th century]]\nDesk-style furniture appears not to have been used in [[classical antiquity]] or in other ancient centers of literate civilization in the [[Middle East]] or [[Far East]], but there is no specific proof. [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] illustrations show the first pieces of furniture which seem to have been designed and constructed for reading and writing. Before the invention of the movable type [[printing press]] in the 15th century, any reader was potentially a writer or publisher or both, since any [[book]] or other [[document]] had to be copied by hand. The desks were designed with slots and hooks for [[bookmark]]s and for writing implements. Since manuscript volumes were sometimes large and heavy, desks of the period usually had massive structures.<ref name=FineWoodWorking>{{cite web| url=http://www.finewoodworking.com/PlansAndProjects/PlansAndProjectsAllAbout.aspx?id=3029 |title=A Short History of Desks |publisher= FineWoodWorking.com |accessdate=2012-05-17}}</ref>\n\nDesks of the [[Renaissance]] and later eras had relatively slimmer structures, and more and more drawers were added as [[woodworking]] became more precise and [[cabinet-making]] became a distinct trade.<ref name=FineWoodWorking/> It is often possible to find out if a table or other piece of furniture of those times was designed to be used as a desk, by looking for a drawer with three small separations (one each for the ink pot, the [[Blotting paper|blotter]] and the powder tray) and storage for [[pen]]s.\n\nThe basic desk forms were developed mostly in the 17th and 18th centuries. The modern [[ergonomic desk]] is a refinement of the mechanically complex [[drawing table]] or drafting table<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/drafting+table |title=Drawing table|publisher= The Free Dictionary By Farlex. |accessdate=2012-05-17}}</ref> from the end of the 18th century.\n\n==Industrial era==\n[[File:Desk333.JPG|thumb|An office desk in a cubicle, which shows the sharing of space between computer components and paper documents.]]\nRefinements to the first desk forms were considerable through the 19th century, as [[steam power|steam-driven]] machinery made cheap [[wood-pulp paper]] possible towards the end of the first phase of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. This allowed an increase in the number of the [[white-collar worker]]s. As these office workers grew in number, desks were [[mass production|mass-produced]] for them in large quantities, using newer, steam-driven woodworking machinery. This was the first sharp division in desk manufacturing. From then on, limited quantities of finely crafted desks have been continued to be constructed by master cabinetmakers for the homes and offices of the rich, while the vast majority of desks were assembled rapidly by unskilled labor from components turned out in batches by [[machine tools]]. Thus, age alone does not guarantee that an antique desk is a masterpiece, since this split in quality took place more than a hundred years ago.\n\nMore paper and correspondence drove the need for more complex desks and more specialized desks, such as the [[rolltop desk]] which was a mass-produced, slatted variant of the classical [[cylinder desk]].<ref name=potted>{{cite web|url=http://www.desk.uk.com/history.asp/|title=A Potted History of Writing Furniture|publisher=Dorking Desks|accessdate=2012-05-17|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421211013/http://www.desk.uk.com/history.asp|archivedate=2012-04-21}}</ref> It provided a relatively fast and cheap way to lock up the ever increasing flow of paperwork without having to file everything by the end of the day. Paper documents became voluminous enough to be stored separately in [[filing cabinet]]s. Correspondence and other documents were now too numerous to get enough attention to be rolled up or folded again, then summarized and tagged before being [[Pigeon-hole messagebox|pigeonholed]] in a small compartment over or under the work surface of the desk. The famous [[Wooton desk]] and others were the last manifestations of the \"pigeonhole\" style. The surfaces of some newer desks could be transformed into many different shapes and angles, and were ideal for artists, draftsmen, and engineers.\n\n==Steel versions==\nA small boom in office work and desk production occurred at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th with the introduction of smaller and less expensive electrical presses{{elucidate|date=April 2015}} and efficient [[carbon paper]] coupled with the general acceptance of the [[typewriter]]. Steel desks were introduced to take heavier loads of paper and withstand the pounding meted out on the typewriters. This also gave rise to the \"[[typewriter desk]]\", a platform, sometimes on wheels and with expandable surface via flaps, that was built to a specific height to make typing easier and more comfortable than when using a standard or traditional desk. The L-shaped desk also became popular, with the \"leg\" being used as an annex for the typewriter.\n\nAnother big expansion occurred after the [[Second World War]] with the spread of [[photocopying]]. Paperwork further increased the number of desk workers, whose work surfaces diminished in size as office rents rose, and the paper itself was moved more and more directly to filing cabinets or sent to specialized [[records management center]]s, or transformed into [[microfilm]], or both. Modular desks seating several co-workers close by became common. Even executive or management desks became mass-produced, built of cheap [[plywood]] or [[fiberboard]] covered with wood finish, as the number of people managing the white collar workers became even greater.\n\n==Student models==\n[[File:SchoolDeskBenchWebsterNewYork.jpg|thumb|School desk manufactured by the American S.F. Company of [[Buffalo, New York]] in about 1900]] [[File:Student Desk.jpg|thumb|Student desk and chair commonly used in high schools and universities.]]\nA student desk can be any desk form meant for use by an enrollee in elementary, secondary or postsecondary education. Anna Breadin designed and patented a one-piece school desk in the late 1880s that was built with a table section attached in front of a wooden seat and back rest. Before this, most students in America sat either on chairs or long benches at long tables.<ref name=interior>{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxhow.in/articles/home-family/interior-design/a-short-history-of-school-desks/|title=A Short History of Desks|publisher=Interior Design|accessdate=2012-05-17|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120804114909/http://www.linuxhow.in/articles/home-family/interior-design/a-short-history-of-school-desks/|archivedate=2012-08-04}}</ref>\n\nIn homes, the term \"student desk\" designates a small [[pedestal desk]]<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pedestal%20desk|title=Pedestal desk|publisher= Merriam-Webster |access-date=2012-05-17}}</ref>, [[Surfboard]] or [[writing table]]<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/writing+table |title=Writing table|publisher= The Free Dictionary By Farlex |accessdate=2012-05-17}}</ref> constructed for use by a teenager or a pre-teen in their room. It often is a pedestal desk, with only one of the two pedestals and about two-thirds of the desk surface. Such desks are sometimes called \"left-pedestal desks\" and \"right-pedestal desks\", depending on the position of the single pedestal. These desks are not as tall as normal adult desks. In some cases, the desk is connected from the seat to the table.\n\nThe desks are usually mass-produced in steel or wood and sold on the consumer market.<ref name=interior/> There is a wide variety of plans available for woodworking enthusiasts to build their own versions. Modern mass-produced student desks are often made with laminate table tops and molded plastic seats in a combined single unit, with storage found under the desktop or on a wire shelf beneath the seat.<ref name=interior/> There are many novel forms of student desks made to maximize the relatively restricted area available in a child's room. One of the most common is the bunk-bed desk, also called the \"[[loft bed]]\".<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.hgtv.com/home-improvement/how-to-build-a-loft-bed-with-a-desk-underneath/index.html|title=How to Build a Loft Bed With a Desk Underneath|publisher= HGTV |accessdate=2012-05-17}}</ref>\n\n==Influence of computers==\n[[File:Schreibtisch.2.JPG|thumb|A desk in an office.]]\nUntil the late 1980s, desks remained a place for paperwork and \"business machines\", but the personal computer was taking hold in large and medium-sized businesses.  New office suites included a \"knee hole\" credenza which was a place for a terminal or personal computer and keyboard tray. Soon, new office designs also included \"U-shape\" suites which added a bridge worksurface between the back credenza and front desk. During the North American recession of the early 1990s, many managers and executive workers were required to do [[word processing]] and other functions previously completed by [[typing pool]]s and secretaries.  This necessitated a more central placement of the computer on these \"U-shape\" suite desk systems.\n\nWith computers more prevalent, \"computer paper\" became an office supply. The beginning of this paper boom gave birth to the dream of the \"[[paperless office]]\", in which all information would only appear on [[computer monitor]]s. However, the ease of printing personal documents and the lack of comfort with reading text on computer monitors led to a great deal of document printing.  The need for paperwork space vied with the increased desk space taken up by computer monitors, computers, printers, scanners, and other peripherals. The need for more space led some desk companies to attach some accessory items to the [[modesty panel]] at the back of the desk, such as [[outlet strip]]s and [[cable management]], in an attempt to clear the desktop of electrical clutter.\n\nThrough the \"tech boom\" of the 1990s, office worker numbers increased along with the cost of office space rent.  The [[cubicle desk]] became widely accepted in North America as an economical way of squeezing more desk workers into the same space, without further shrinking the size of their cramped working surfaces. The cubicle walls have become a  new place for workers to affix papers and other items once left on the horizontal desktop surface. Even computer monitor bezels themselves were used to attach [[Post-it note|reminder notes]] and [[business card]]s.\n\nEarly in the 2000s, private office workers found that their side and back computer-placing furniture made it hard to show the contents of a computer screen to guests or co-workers. Manufacturers have responded to this issue by creating \"forward facing\" desks where computer monitors are placed on the front of the \"U-shape\" workstation. This forward computer monitor placement promotes a clearer sight-line to greet colleagues and allows for common viewing of information displayed on a screen.\n\nReplacement of bulky [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] monitors with flat panel [[LCD]]s freed up significant room on desktops.  However, the size of displays often increased to accommodate multiple on-screen windows, to display more and more information simultaneously. The lighter weight and slimmer profile of the new displays allowed them to be mounted on flexible arms, so they could be swung into view or out of the way, and adjusted frequently as needed.\n\n==Notable examples==\n*The [[Resolute desk|''Resolute'' desk]] in the [[Oval Office]] has been used by many [[United States]] presidents, including [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Barack Obama]]. It is made from the timbers of {{HMS|Resolute|1850|6}}, an abandoned British ship discovered by an American vessel and returned to [[Queen Victoria|Queen Victoria of Great Britain]] as a token of friendship and goodwill. Queen Victoria commissioned the desk from William Evenden, Royal Naval Dockyard at Chatham, England, and presented it to President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] in 1880.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/furnishings/resolute-desk.htm |title=Resolute desk |publisher= The White House Museum |accessdate=2012-05-17}}</ref>\n\n*The [[Bureau du Roi]] ({{IPA-fr|by\u0281o dy \u0281wa}}, ''the King's desk''), also known as Louis XV's roll-top secretary ({{lang-fr|Secr\u00e9taire \u00e0 cylindre de Louis XV}}), is the richly ornamented royal [[cylinder desk]] which was constructed at the end of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]'s reign, and is now again in the [[Palace of Versailles]].\n\n*[[Henry VIII's writing desk]] is a portable [[writing desk]], made in about 1525-26 for [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. It is currently in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].  The desk is a product of the royal workshops and is lavishly embellished with ornamental motifs introduced to the [[Kingdom of England]] by continental artists.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of desk forms and types]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*Aronson, Joseph.

Since manuscript volumes were sometimes large and heavy, desks of the period usually had massive structures.<ref name=FineWoodWorking>{{cite web| url=http://www.finewoodworking.com/PlansAndProjects/PlansAndProjectsAllAbout.aspx?id=3029 |title=A Short History of Desks |publisher= FineWoodWorking.com |accessdate=2012-05-17}}</ref>\n\nDesks of the [[Renaissance]] and later eras had relatively slimmer structures, and more and more drawers were added as [[woodworking]] became more precise and [[cabinet-making]] became a distinct trade.<ref name=FineWoodWorking/> It is often possible to find out if a table or other piece of furniture of those times was designed to be used as a desk, by looking for a drawer with three small separations (one each for the ink pot, the [[Blotting paper|blotter]] and the powder tray) and storage for [[pen]]s.\n\nThe basic desk forms were developed mostly in the 17th and 18th centuries. The modern [[ergonomic desk]] is a refinement of the mechanically complex [[drawing table]] or drafting table<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/drafting+table |title=Drawing table|publisher= The Free Dictionary By Farlex. |accessdate=2012-05-17}}</ref> from the end of the 18th century.\n\n==Industrial era==\n[[File:Desk333.JPG|thumb|An office desk in a cubicle, which shows the sharing of space between computer components and paper documents.]]\nRefinements to the first desk forms were considerable through the 19th century, as [[steam power|steam-driven]] machinery made cheap [[wood-pulp paper]] possible towards the end of the first phase of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. This allowed an increase in the number of the [[white-collar worker]]s. As these office workers grew in number, desks were [[mass production|mass-produced]] for them in large quantities, using newer, steam-driven woodworking machinery. This was the first sharp division in desk manufacturing. From then on, limited quantities of finely crafted desks have been continued to be constructed by master cabinetmakers for the homes and offices of the rich, while the vast majority of desks were assembled rapidly by unskilled labor from components turned out in batches by [[machine tools]]. Thus, age alone does not guarantee that an antique desk is a masterpiece, since this split in quality took place more than a hundred years ago.\n\nMore paper and correspondence drove the need for more complex desks and more specialized desks, such as the [[rolltop desk]] which was a mass-produced, slatted variant of the classical [[cylinder desk]].<ref name=potted>{{cite web|url=http://www.desk.uk.com/history.asp/|title=A Potted History of Writing Furniture|publisher=Dorking Desks|accessdate=2012-05-17|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421211013/http://www.desk.uk.com/history.asp|archivedate=2012-04-21}}</ref> It provided a relatively fast and cheap way to lock up the ever increasing flow of paperwork without having to file everything by the end of the day. Paper documents became voluminous enough to be stored separately in [[filing cabinet]]s. Correspondence and other documents were now too numerous to get enough attention to be rolled up or folded again, then summarized and tagged before being [[Pigeon-hole messagebox|pigeonholed]] in a small compartment over or under the work surface of the desk. The famous [[Wooton desk]] and others were the last manifestations of the \"pigeonhole\" style. The surfaces of some newer desks could be transformed into many different shapes and angles, and were ideal for artists, draftsmen, and engineers.\n\n==Steel versions==\nA small boom in office work and desk production occurred at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th with the introduction of smaller and less expensive electrical presses{{elucidate|date=April 2015}} and efficient [[carbon paper]] coupled with the general acceptance of the [[typewriter]]. Steel desks were introduced to take heavier loads of paper and withstand the pounding meted out on the typewriters. This also gave rise to the \"[[typewriter desk]]\", a platform, sometimes on wheels and with expandable surface via flaps, that was built to a specific height to make typing easier and more comfortable than when using a standard or traditional desk. The L-shaped desk also became popular, with the \"leg\" being used as an annex for the typewriter.\n\nAnother big expansion occurred after the [[Second World War]] with the spread of [[photocopying]]. Paperwork further increased the number of desk workers, whose work surfaces diminished in size as office rents rose, and the paper itself was moved more and more directly to filing cabinets or sent to specialized [[records management center]]s, or transformed into [[microfilm]], or both. Modular desks seating several co-workers close by became common. Even executive or management desks became mass-produced, built of cheap [[plywood]] or [[fiberboard]] covered with wood finish, as the number of people managing the white collar workers became even greater.\n\n==Student models==\n[[File:SchoolDeskBenchWebsterNewYork.jpg|thumb|School desk manufactured by the American S.F. Company of [[Buffalo, New York]] in about 1900]] [[File:Student Desk.jpg|thumb|Student desk and chair commonly used in high schools and universities.]]\nA student desk can be any desk form meant for use by an enrollee in elementary, secondary or postsecondary education. Anna Breadin designed and patented a one-piece school desk in the late 1880s that was built with a table section attached in front of a wooden seat and back rest. Before this, most students in America sat either on chairs or long benches at long tables.<ref name=interior>{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxhow.in/articles/home-family/interior-design/a-short-history-of-school-desks/|title=A Short History of Desks|publisher=Interior Design|accessdate=2012-05-17|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120804114909/http://www.linuxhow.in/articles/home-family/interior-design/a-short-history-of-school-desks/|archivedate=2012-08-04}}</ref>\n\nIn homes, the term \"student desk\" designates a small [[pedestal desk]]<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pedestal%20desk|title=Pedestal desk|publisher= Merriam-Webster |access-date=2012-05-17}}</ref>, [[Surfboard]] or [[writing table]]<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/writing+table |title=Writing table|publisher= The Free Dictionary By Farlex |accessdate=2012-05-17}}</ref> constructed for use by a teenager or a pre-teen in their room. It often is a pedestal desk, with only one of the two pedestals and about two-thirds of the desk surface. Such desks are sometimes called \"left-pedestal desks\" and \"right-pedestal desks\", depending on the position of the single pedestal. These desks are not as tall as normal adult desks. In some cases, the desk is connected from the seat to the table.\n\nThe desks are usually mass-produced in steel or wood and sold on the consumer market.<ref name=interior/> There is a wide variety of plans available for woodworking enthusiasts to build their own versions. Modern mass-produced student desks are often made with laminate table tops and molded plastic seats in a combined single unit, with storage found under the desktop or on a wire shelf beneath the seat.<ref name=interior/> There are many novel forms of student desks made to maximize the relatively restricted area available in a child's room. One of the most common is the bunk-bed desk, also called the \"[[loft bed]]\".<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.hgtv.com/home-improvement/how-to-build-a-loft-bed-with-a-desk-underneath/index.html|title=How to Build a Loft Bed With a Desk Underneath|publisher= HGTV |accessdate=2012-05-17}}</ref>\n\n==Influence of computers==\n[[File:Schreibtisch.2.JPG|thumb|A desk in an office.]]\nUntil the late 1980s, desks remained a place for paperwork and \"business machines\", but the personal computer was taking hold in large and medium-sized businesses.  New office suites included a \"knee hole\" credenza which was a place for a terminal or personal computer and keyboard tray. Soon, new office designs also included \"U-shape\" suites which added a bridge worksurface between the back credenza and front desk. During the North American recession of the early 1990s, many managers and executive workers were required to do [[word processing]] and other functions previously completed by [[typing pool]]s and secretaries.  This necessitated a more central placement of the computer on these \"U-shape\" suite desk systems.\n\nWith computers more prevalent, \"computer paper\" became an office supply. The beginning of this paper boom gave birth to the dream of the \"[[paperless office]]\", in which all information would only appear on [[computer monitor]]s. However, the ease of printing personal documents and the lack of comfort with reading text on computer monitors led to a great deal of document printing.  The need for paperwork space vied with the increased desk space taken up by computer monitors, computers, printers, scanners, and other peripherals. The need for more space led some desk companies to attach some accessory items to the [[modesty panel]] at the back of the desk, such as [[outlet strip]]s and [[cable management]], in an attempt to clear the desktop of electrical clutter.\n\nThrough the \"tech boom\" of the 1990s, office worker numbers increased along with the cost of office space rent.  The [[cubicle desk]] became widely accepted in North America as an economical way of squeezing more desk workers into the same space, without further shrinking the size of their cramped working surfaces. The cubicle walls have become a  new place for workers to affix papers and other items once left on the horizontal desktop surface. Even computer monitor bezels themselves were used to attach [[Post-it note|reminder notes]] and [[business card]]s.\n\nEarly in the 2000s, private office workers found that their side and back computer-placing furniture made it hard to show the contents of a computer screen to guests or co-workers. Manufacturers have responded to this issue by creating \"forward facing\" desks where computer monitors are placed on the front of the \"U-shape\" workstation. This forward computer monitor placement promotes a clearer sight-line to greet colleagues and allows for common viewing of information displayed on a screen.\n\nReplacement of bulky [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] monitors with flat panel [[LCD]]s freed up significant room on desktops.  However, the size of displays often increased to accommodate multiple on-screen windows, to display more and more information simultaneously. The lighter weight and slimmer profile of the new displays allowed them to be mounted on flexible arms, so they could be swung into view or out of the way, and adjusted frequently as needed.\n\n==Notable examples==\n*The [[Resolute desk|''Resolute'' desk]] in the [[Oval Office]] has been used by many [[United States]] presidents, including [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Barack Obama]]. It is made from the timbers of {{HMS|Resolute|1850|6}}, an abandoned British ship discovered by an American vessel and returned to [[Queen Victoria|Queen Victoria of Great Britain]] as a token of friendship and goodwill. Queen Victoria commissioned the desk from William Evenden, Royal Naval Dockyard at Chatham, England, and presented it to President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] in 1880.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/furnishings/resolute-desk.htm |title=Resolute desk |publisher= The White House Museum |accessdate=2012-05-17}}</ref>\n\n*The [[Bureau du Roi]] ({{IPA-fr|by\u0281o dy \u0281wa}}, ''the King's desk''), also known as Louis XV's roll-top secretary ({{lang-fr|Secr\u00e9taire \u00e0 cylindre de Louis XV}}), is the richly ornamented royal [[cylinder desk]] which was constructed at the end of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]'s reign, and is now again in the [[Palace of Versailles]].\n\n*[[Henry VIII's writing desk]] is a portable [[writing desk]], made in about 1525-26 for [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].

His name was also featured in Wisden Cricketers of the Decade at the end of 2019.\n\nDe Villiers began his international career as a wicket-keeper-batsman, but he has played most often solely as a batsman. He batted at various positions in the batting order, but predominantly in the middle-order. Noted as one of the most innovative and destructive batsmen in the modern era, De Villiers is known for a range of unorthodox shots, particularly behind the wicket-keeper.<ref name=absuperman>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/ab-de-villiers-retires-what-made-mr-360-a-modern-day-great-1239718-2018-05-23 |title=AB de Villiers retires: What made Mr. 360 a modern-day great |last=Sen |first=Rohan |date=23 May 2018 |magazine=[[India Today]] |access-date=9 September 2018}}</ref> \n\nHe made his international debut in a [[Test cricket|Test match]] against England in 2004 and first played a [[One Day International]] (ODI) in early 2005.

He also holds the second-highest individual score by a South African batsman, with 278 (not out). Until 2012 he was an occasional [[wicket-keeper]] for South Africa, although after the retirement of regular Test keeper [[Mark Boucher]] and under his own captaincy he has started to regularly keep wicket for the national side in Tests, ODIs and T20Is. He gave up wicket-keeping in 2015 and handed the gloves to [[debutant]] [[Quinton de Kock]].\n\nHe holds the records for the fastest 50 (16 balls), 100 (31 balls) and 150 (64 balls) of all time in One Day Internationals by any batsmen, and also holds the fastest hundred by a South African in Tests and the fastest 50 by South African in T20Is. He is a three-time ICC ODI player of the year, winning the award in 2010, 2014 and 2015.\n\nAfter the [[2011 Cricket World Cup]] he succeeded [[Graeme Smith]] as captain of the national ODI side, and became Test captain after the second Test of the [[English cricket team in South Africa in 2015\u201316|home series against England in 2015/16]]. He stepped down from Test captaincy in December 2016 due to an elbow injury which kept him out of the team for a long period.\n\n==International career==\n[[File:AB de villiers (cropped).jpg|thumb|252px|De Villiers in 2006]]\n\n===Early career===\nAfter a spell in the South Africa U19 team, he made his debut for the Titans in 2003/4.\n\nHe made his Test debut as a 20-year-old on 16 December 2004 against England at Port Elizabeth. He made a strong impression opening the batting, but was dropped down the order for the second Test and also handed the wicket-keeping gloves. In this match, he made a match-saving half-century from number seven. However, he found himself at the top of the order again for the final Test of the series.\n\nDespite a good tour of the Caribbean where he scored 178 to help South Africa seal a Test series win, his rapid progress was slowed on the [[South African cricket team in Australia in 2005-06|tour of Australia]] in 2005. Despite playing [[Shane Warne]] well and becoming the second-youngest and second-fastest South African to reach 1,000 Test runs after [[Graeme Pollock]], he struggled and made just 152 runs in 6 innings.\n\nHe has been used in a similar fashion to [[Jonty Rhodes]] in ODIs, opening the innings, although he currently bats in the middle order. De Villiers gave the selectors a sign by producing his then highest one-day score of 92 not out, which included 12 fours and one six, from 98 balls against India in the 2006 winter series.\n\nDe Villiers had a reputation as an outstanding fielder, typified by a diving run-out of [[Simon Katich]] of Australia in 2006, when he dived to stop the ball, and while still lying on his stomach facing away from the stumps, he tossed the ball backwards over his shoulder and effected a direct hit. This has also led people to make further comparisons of him to Jonty Rhodes, who was also one of the finest fielders of his generation. His fielding positions other than wicket-keeper are 1st and 2nd slip and cover.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH8KrkRYIQA |title=Ponting's Top Five fielders of all time |author=Cricket.com.au |date=21 May 2017 |website=YouTube |accessdate=27 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===2007 Cricket World Cup in West Indies===\nCompeting in the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]], AB was in good form in ODIs having scored four 50s during the South Africa vs India/Pakistan (2007) matches.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn the early stages of the tournament AB's form was poor with three failures including a duck against the [[Netherlands national cricket team|Netherlands]] in a match where his team broke various records for batting,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wc2007/content/story/285626.html?object=247462 |title=Gibbs sets records galore |first1=S. |last1=Rajesh |first2=H.

This was followed by a 97 at [[The Oval]] before he came down the wicket trying to smash [[Monty Panesar]] for a boundary and was caught on the fence.\n\nIn the first Test in Perth, De Villiers scored a match-winning century to help South Africa chase down the second-highest-ever fourth innings target of 414 with six wickets in hand. This was South Africa's first Test victory in Australia in 15 years and appeared to go a long way towards tilting world cricket's balance of power after over a decade of Australian dominance. De Villiers also took four diving catches in the course of the match, including one to dismiss [[Jason Krejza]], a stunner at backward point.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://content-nz.cricinfo.com/ausvrsa2008_09/engine/match/351681.html |title=1st Test Australia v South Africa at Perth, 17\u201321 December 2008 |website=ESPNcricinfo |access-date=21 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nDe Villiers only scored 11 runs in the second Test at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] and made another low score in the first innings of the final Test at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]].

He then scored 82 not out from 85 balls with 6 fours and a six to win the series and was named the man of the match.\n\nIn the first Test of the return series at the Wanderers Stadium, De Villiers provided lone resistance in the first innings against a bowling attack led by pace bowler, [[Mitchell Johnson (cricketer)|Mitchell Johnson]], scoring 104* off 185 balls with 9 fours and 1 six, while his teammates all fell for under 50. But in the second innings he made only 3 off 7.\n\nIn the third Test, after centuries from [[Ashwell Prince]] and Jacques Kallis, De Villiers was the third centurion of the innings with a score of 163 off 196 balls with 12 fours and 7 sixes. This knock also tied the record for most sixes in an over as De Villiers, off the bowling of McDonald, hit four consecutive sixes.\n\nIn the following 5-game ODI series, De Villiers played consistently, although starting badly in the first game, scoring only 2 runs. However, he went on to make 36*, 80, 84 and 38 and was named Player of the Series at the conclusion of game 5.\n\nHe was rested for the two-match Twenty20 series against Zimbabwe and because [[Mark Boucher]] was injured as well [[Heino Kuhn]] donned the keeping gloves. De Villiers returned for the ODI series and also took over the gloves while Boucher was recovering. He did well against Zimbabwe scoring two centuries out of the three ODIs as South Africa comfortably won the three match series 3\u20130.\n\nHis major challenge came against Pakistan for the two Twenty20 matches, where he kept wicket. In the first match, he was out for a second-ball duck off a superb delivery by [[Shoaib Akhtar]]. In the second T20I he scored 11 runs. He then participated in the five-match ODI series where South Africa were chasing 203 to win and he scored 51 before he was caught and bowled by Saeed Ajmal. In the second ODI he scored 29 as he was bowled by [[Shahid Afridi]]; in the same match, a flamboyant [[Abdul Razzaq (cricketer)|Abdul Razzaq]] played the greatest innings of his life to lift Pakistan to an unbelievable victory. During the third match, he scored 19 before he was stumped by [[Zulqarnain Haider]]. It turned out to be a mistake by the umpire as he had pressed the wrong button. In the fourth match, he missed out on a half-century while on 49 when he gave his wicket to the fielder at point. His good form in the series continued when he scored 61 in the final ODI as South Africa won by 57 runs and the series 3\u20132.\n\nFor his performances in 2009 and 2010, he was named in the World Test XI by the ICC,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci-icc/content/story/427665.html|title=Johnson and Gambhir scoop top awards|date=1 October 2009|website=Cricinfo}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci-icc/content/story/480081.html|title=Dhoni leads ICC Test Team of Year|date=6 October 2010|website=Cricinfo}}</ref> and was also named in the World ODI XI in 2010.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci-icc/content/story/480086.html|title=Ponting named to lead ODI team of the year|date=6 October 2010|website=Cricinfo}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n===2011 Cricket World Cup===\nAB de Villiers scored two successive centuries in the [[2011 Cricket World Cup|2011 World Cup]].

February 1984), is a South African cricketer. In limited overs cricket he is an attacking batsman.<ref>{{cite web |title=The men's ODI XI of the last 25 years |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/25/content/story/1146989.html |website=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=22 June 2019 |language=en |date=18 June 2018}}</ref> He was named as the [[ICC ODI Player of the Year]] three times during his 15-year international career. His name was also featured in Wisden Cricketers of the Decade at the end of 2019.\n\nDe Villiers began his international career as a wicket-keeper-batsman, but he has played most often solely as a batsman. He batted at various positions in the batting order, but predominantly in the middle-order. Noted as one of the most innovative and destructive batsmen in the modern era, De Villiers is known for a range of unorthodox shots, particularly behind the wicket-keeper.<ref name=absuperman>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/ab-de-villiers-retires-what-made-mr-360-a-modern-day-great-1239718-2018-05-23 |title=AB de Villiers retires: What made Mr. 360 a modern-day great |last=Sen |first=Rohan |date=23 May 2018 |magazine=[[India Today]] |access-date=9 September 2018}}</ref> \n\nHe made his international debut in a [[Test cricket|Test match]] against England in 2004 and first played a [[One Day International]] (ODI) in early 2005. His debut in [[Twenty20 International]] cricket came in 2006. He scored over 8,000 [[Run (cricket)|runs]] in both Test and ODI cricket and is one of the very few batsmen to have a [[batting average (cricket)|batting average]] of over fifty in both forms of the game.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/23581884/ab-de-villiers-genius-two-formats |title=AB de Villiers: A genius in two formats |last1=Rajesh |first1=S. |last2=Jayaraman |first2=Shiva |date=23 May 2018 |website=[[ESPNcricinfo]] |access-date=24 May 2018}}</ref> He holds the record for the fastest ODI century in just 31 balls. He also records the fastest ODI 50 and 150.\n\nDe Villiers captained South Africa in all three formats, although after a series of injuries he stepped down from the Test captaincy.

He holds the record for most Test innings without registering a duck (78),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.howstat.com/cricket/Statistics/Batting/BattingDucks4.asp |title=Players Batting 30 Innings before First Duck |website=Howstat |access-date=27 November 2008}}</ref> before being dismissed for nought against [[Bangladesh national cricket team|Bangladesh]] in November 2008. He also holds the second-highest individual score by a South African batsman, with 278 (not out). Until 2012 he was an occasional [[wicket-keeper]] for South Africa, although after the retirement of regular Test keeper [[Mark Boucher]] and under his own captaincy he has started to regularly keep wicket for the national side in Tests, ODIs and T20Is. He gave up wicket-keeping in 2015 and handed the gloves to [[debutant]] [[Quinton de Kock]].\n\nHe holds the records for the fastest 50 (16 balls), 100 (31 balls) and 150 (64 balls) of all time in One Day Internationals by any batsmen, and also holds the fastest hundred by a South African in Tests and the fastest 50 by South African in T20Is. He is a three-time ICC ODI player of the year, winning the award in 2010, 2014 and 2015.\n\nAfter the [[2011 Cricket World Cup]] he succeeded [[Graeme Smith]] as captain of the national ODI side, and became Test captain after the second Test of the [[English cricket team in South Africa in 2015\u201316|home series against England in 2015/16]]. He stepped down from Test captaincy in December 2016 due to an elbow injury which kept him out of the team for a long period.\n\n==International career==\n[[File:AB de villiers (cropped).jpg|thumb|252px|De Villiers in 2006]]\n\n===Early career===\nAfter a spell in the South Africa U19 team, he made his debut for the Titans in 2003/4.\n\nHe made his Test debut as a 20-year-old on 16 December 2004 against England at Port Elizabeth. He made a strong impression opening the batting, but was dropped down the order for the second Test and also handed the wicket-keeping gloves. In this match, he made a match-saving half-century from number seven. However, he found himself at the top of the order again for the final Test of the series.\n\nDespite a good tour of the Caribbean where he scored 178 to help South Africa seal a Test series win, his rapid progress was slowed on the [[South African cricket team in Australia in 2005-06|tour of Australia]] in 2005. Despite playing [[Shane Warne]] well and becoming the second-youngest and second-fastest South African to reach 1,000 Test runs after [[Graeme Pollock]], he struggled and made just 152 runs in 6 innings.\n\nHe has been used in a similar fashion to [[Jonty Rhodes]] in ODIs, opening the innings, although he currently bats in the middle order. De Villiers gave the selectors a sign by producing his then highest one-day score of 92 not out, which included 12 fours and one six, from 98 balls against India in the 2006 winter series.\n\nDe Villiers had a reputation as an outstanding fielder, typified by a diving run-out of [[Simon Katich]] of Australia in 2006, when he dived to stop the ball, and while still lying on his stomach facing away from the stumps, he tossed the ball backwards over his shoulder and effected a direct hit. This has also led people to make further comparisons of him to Jonty Rhodes, who was also one of the finest fielders of his generation. His fielding positions other than wicket-keeper are 1st and 2nd slip and cover.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH8KrkRYIQA |title=Ponting's Top Five fielders of all time |author=Cricket.com.au |date=21 May 2017 |website=YouTube |accessdate=27 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===2007 Cricket World Cup in West Indies===\nCompeting in the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]], AB was in good form in ODIs having scored four 50s during the South Africa vs India/Pakistan (2007) matches.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn the early stages of the tournament AB's form was poor with three failures including a duck against the [[Netherlands national cricket team|Netherlands]] in a match where his team broke various records for batting,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wc2007/content/story/285626.html?object=247462 |title=Gibbs sets records galore |first1=S. |last1=Rajesh |first2=H.

He had to bat with a runner for the latter stages of his innings and found every shot painful due to a combination of cramps, heat exhaustion and dehydration.{{citation needed |date=May 2016}} His innings consisted of a second wicket partnership of 170 with [[Jacques Kallis]] and a third wicket partnership of 70 with [[Herschelle Gibbs]]. De Villiers' innings helped set up a total of 356/4 from 50 overs.\n\nHis batting during the World Cup was inconsistent as he also [[Duck (cricket)|failed to score]] on 4 occasions, itself a record.<ref name=\"stats.ODI\">{{cite web |url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/44936.html?class=2;template=results;trophy=12;type=batting;view=innings |title=Statistics: AB De Villiers One-Day Internationals |website=ESPNcricinfo |access-date=17 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Gaining attention===\nOn 4 April 2008, De Villiers became the first South African to score a [[double century]] against [[India national cricket team|India]] with his top score of 217.\n\nDe Villiers scored an obdurate 174 that helped set up a ten-wicket win for South Africa in the second Test against England at Headingley Carnegie in Leeds in July 2008. This was followed by a 97 at [[The Oval]] before he came down the wicket trying to smash [[Monty Panesar]] for a boundary and was caught on the fence.\n\nIn the first Test in Perth, De Villiers scored a match-winning century to help South Africa chase down the second-highest-ever fourth innings target of 414 with six wickets in hand. This was South Africa's first Test victory in Australia in 15 years and appeared to go a long way towards tilting world cricket's balance of power after over a decade of Australian dominance. De Villiers also took four diving catches in the course of the match, including one to dismiss [[Jason Krejza]], a stunner at backward point.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://content-nz.cricinfo.com/ausvrsa2008_09/engine/match/351681.html |title=1st Test Australia v South Africa at Perth, 17\u201321 December 2008 |website=ESPNcricinfo |access-date=21 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nDe Villiers only scored 11 runs in the second Test at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] and made another low score in the first innings of the final Test at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]. In the second innings of that Test though, De Villiers scored a patient half-century as South Africa almost held on for an against-the-odds draw.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ausvrsa2008_09/engine/current/match/351683.html |title=3rd Test, South Africa tour of Australia at Sydney, 3-7 January 2009 |website=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=4 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nDuring ODI series, in the 4th ODI in Adelaide, he played as wicket-keeper after Boucher was ruled out. He then scored 82 not out from 85 balls with 6 fours and a six to win the series and was named the man of the match.\n\nIn the first Test of the return series at the Wanderers Stadium, De Villiers provided lone resistance in the first innings against a bowling attack led by pace bowler, [[Mitchell Johnson (cricketer)|Mitchell Johnson]], scoring 104* off 185 balls with 9 fours and 1 six, while his teammates all fell for under 50. But in the second innings he made only 3 off 7.\n\nIn the third Test, after centuries from [[Ashwell Prince]] and Jacques Kallis, De Villiers was the third centurion of the innings with a score of 163 off 196 balls with 12 fours and 7 sixes. This knock also tied the record for most sixes in an over as De Villiers, off the bowling of McDonald, hit four consecutive sixes.\n\nIn the following 5-game ODI series, De Villiers played consistently, although starting badly in the first game, scoring only 2 runs. However, he went on to make 36*, 80, 84 and 38 and was named Player of the Series at the conclusion of game 5.\n\nHe was rested for the two-match Twenty20 series against Zimbabwe and because [[Mark Boucher]] was injured as well [[Heino Kuhn]] donned the keeping gloves. De Villiers returned for the ODI series and also took over the gloves while Boucher was recovering. He did well against Zimbabwe scoring two centuries out of the three ODIs as South Africa comfortably won the three match series 3\u20130.\n\nHis major challenge came against Pakistan for the two Twenty20 matches, where he kept wicket. In the first match, he was out for a second-ball duck off a superb delivery by [[Shoaib Akhtar]]. In the second T20I he scored 11 runs. He then participated in the five-match ODI series where South Africa were chasing 203 to win and he scored 51 before he was caught and bowled by Saeed Ajmal. In the second ODI he scored 29 as he was bowled by [[Shahid Afridi]]; in the same match, a flamboyant [[Abdul Razzaq (cricketer)|Abdul Razzaq]] played the greatest innings of his life to lift Pakistan to an unbelievable victory. During the third match, he scored 19 before he was stumped by [[Zulqarnain Haider]]. It turned out to be a mistake by the umpire as he had pressed the wrong button. In the fourth match, he missed out on a half-century while on 49 when he gave his wicket to the fielder at point. His good form in the series continued when he scored 61 in the final ODI as South Africa won by 57 runs and the series 3\u20132.\n\nFor his performances in 2009 and 2010, he was named in the World Test XI by the ICC,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci-icc/content/story/427665.html|title=Johnson and Gambhir scoop top awards|date=1 October 2009|website=Cricinfo}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci-icc/content/story/480081.html|title=Dhoni leads ICC Test Team of Year|date=6 October 2010|website=Cricinfo}}</ref> and was also named in the World ODI XI in 2010.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci-icc/content/story/480086.html|title=Ponting named to lead ODI team of the year|date=6 October 2010|website=Cricinfo}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n===2011 Cricket World Cup===\nAB de Villiers scored two successive centuries in the [[2011 Cricket World Cup|2011 World Cup]]. He became the first South African to score two centuries in a single World Cup and the fifth batsman after [[Mark Waugh]], [[Saeed Anwar]], [[Rahul Dravid]] and [[Matthew Hayden]] to score two consecutive centuries in a single World Cup tournament. He also became the 16th batsman to score two or more centuries in one World Cup tournament. AB de Villiers' strike rate of 136.73 is the highest among South African batsmen who have [[List of Cricket World Cup centuries|scored centuries in World Cup matches]]. With his third player of the match award in World Cups, De Villiers is joint second with Jacques Kallis on the list of South African players with most match awards in World Cups. Lance Klusener heads the list with five awards.\n\n===Rising through the ranks===\nOn 6 June 2011, then South Africa coach [[Gary Kirsten]] announced that AB de Villiers would be South Africa's new limited-overs captain. \"I'm very excited but I'm also inexperienced. But I've learnt a lot the last seven years from an unbelievable captain,\" said De Villiers, who had never captained a team at first-class level. \"It's a big responsibility, but there'll be a fresh look in the side, which is good.\"\n\nIn the 2011\u201312 South African summer, De Villiers featured in the [[Australian cricket team in South Africa in 2011\u201312|home series against Australia]] and [[Sri Lankan cricket team in South Africa in 2011\u201312|against Sri Lanka]].

Two sites downtown were possible contenders: one north centered on Federal Street and Akard, and one south centered on Young Street.\n\nPlans proceeded until cost estimates shocked city leaders and the plan was shelved, although land at the southern site was acquired by the city for future use.\n\nThe 1963 [[John F.

Pei]] to design the new facility.\n\nConstruction began on June 26, 1972 under the direction of contractor Robert E. McKee and Pei. The project was completed in three phases. The City accepted the garage parking areas in November 1974; the Park Plaza in May 1976; and the building in December 1977. The cost of design and construction of the building, the Park Plaza and the garage was over $70 million. Controversies arose over cost overruns (the original estimated cost was $42.2 million) and aesthetic issues (was the building too avant-garde?), though most problems were addressed and work moved on to completion.<ref name=\"dallascityhall.com\"/>\n\nThe first Dallas City Council meeting was held in the building's City Council Chamber on February 1, 1978, and the entire facility was formally opened and dedicated on March 12, 1978<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://texasarchive.org/2010_01092|title=Dallas City Hall - An Architect's View (1978)|last=|first=|date=|website=Texas Archive of the Moving Image|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 19, 2019}}</ref>.\n\n==Design==\n<blockquote>When you do a city hall, it has to convey an image of the people, and this had to represent the people of Dallas ... The people I met &ndash; rich and poor, powerful and not so powerful &ndash; were all very proud of their city. They felt that Dallas was the greatest city there was, and I could not disappoint them.\n&ndash; I.M. Pei<ref>http://www.galinsky.com/buildings/dallascityhall/index.htm</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[I.M. Pei]]'s [[modern architecture|modernist]] inverted [[pyramid]] design is a result of space requirements from city government. Public areas and citizen services required much less space than offices that ran the government and overhanging the upper floors allowed them to be larger than the public spaces below. The building slopes at a 34\u00b0 angle, with each of the 7 above-grade floors being 9\u00bd feet wider than the one below. This inclined fa\u00e7ade interacts with the buildings it faces downtown and provides protection from the weather and Texas sun.<ref>http://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/texas/dallas/cityhall/pei.html</ref>\n\nThe foundation and basement levels are considerably wider than the apparent footprint of the structure, extending out beneath the inclined facade. The [[cantilever]]ed roof is 200 feet (61 meters) wide, the ground floor is 126 feet (38.4 meters) wide, and the basement 230 feet (70.1 meters) wide.<ref name=\"architectureweek.com\">http://www.architectureweek.com/2009/0729/building_2-2.html</ref>\nWhen Mayor Jonsson reacted to the apparent top-heaviness of the building's shape, 3 cylindrical pillars that appear to hold up the structure were created. These contain stairwells that had originally been concealed within the design. These pillars only provide visual support and do not bear the load of the building.<ref name=\"architectureweek.com\"/>\n\nPei also persuaded the city to acquire an additional 6 acres in front of the building as a plaza and buffer zone for his grand public structure. A 1,325 car parking garage was built beneath the plaza, and the extra income helped supplement the funding of the building.\n\nA buff-colored concrete was chosen for the main building material; its color resembled local earth tones. Since concrete was both the primary structural and finish material, close attention was paid to every aspect of its mix and placement.<ref name=\"architectureweek.com\"/>\n\nThe design of Dallas City Hall inspired the [[J. Erik Jonsson Central Library]] building located across the street &ndash; whereas the upper floors of City Hall are oriented ''toward'' Marilla Street, the upper floors of the Central Library are oriented ''away from'' Marilla (and, in a form of symmetry, away from City Hall).\n\nThe building features in the ''[[Robocop]]'' movies of the 1980s, as the Headquarters of the OCP company; special effects were employed to make the building appear taller than it is.<ref>http://texaspopculture.blogspot.com.au/2013/03/robocop-visits-city-hall.html</ref><ref>http://www.dallasfilmcommission.com/robocop-dallas-locations-then-now/</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\n*City Hall contained 1,400 workstations when it opened in 1978. It had few floor-to-ceiling walls, using instead five-, six-, and seven-foot-high partitions to create separate offices. The absence of walls allowed employees and visitors to have window views from all areas.\n*The second floor of Dallas City Hall is referred to as the Great Court because of its {{convert|250|ft|m|adj=on}} length and the uninterrupted height to the vaulted ceiling approximately {{convert|100|ft|m}} above.\n*The Park Plaza is two blocks long and one block wide and is bounded by Young, Ervay, Marilla and Akard streets. The Plaza includes a {{convert|180|ft|m|adj=on}}-diameter reflecting pool, a variable-height fountain, park benches and three distinctive {{convert|84|ft|m|adj=on}}-high flagpoles. The Plaza is landscaped with trees native to Texas: live oaks and red oaks. The reflective pool contains large floating sculptures designed by artist [[Marta Pan]].\n*A {{convert|16|ft|m|adj=on}}-high by {{convert|24|ft|m|adj=on}}-wide, three-piece sculpture titled \"The Dallas Piece\" was designed by [[Henry Moore]] for the plaza and resembles vertebrae.\n*A state-of-the-art Conference Center that includes a 156-seat auditorium and three conference rooms was recently {{when|date=May 2019}}added to Dallas City Hall.\n*A tunnel and station for future rail transit was constructed in the third level basement beneath the parking garage and Marilla Street. This tunnel has remained unused but has been considered for [[Dallas Area Rapid Transit|DART's]] second light rail route through downtown Dallas.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:ProtestMarchDallasCityHall.jpg | City Hall Plaza is regularly used for marches and protests{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\nFile:DallasCityHall_view.jpg | View from City Hall toward downtown\nFile:DallasCityHallA.jpg | Side view of City Hall\nFile:DallasCityHallInterior.jpg | Interior corridors of City Hall\nFile:View from Reunion Tower August 2015 14.jpg | View of City Hall from [[Reunion Tower]]\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Dallas City Hall}}\n{{Portal|Architecture}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060427005218/http://www.dallasarchitecture.info/cityhall.htm Dallasarchitecture.info - Dallas City Hall]\n* [http://www.dallascityhall.com Dallascityhall.com - Official City of Dallas website]\n* [http://www.architectureweek.com/2009/0729/building_2-1.html Architecture Week: \"Engineering a Pei Cantilever \u2014 Dallas City Hall\"]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090304031642/http://pcfandp.com/a/p/6602/s.html Pei Cobb Freed & Partners]\n* [http://www.dallasnews.com/cityhallblog ''Dallas Morning News'': City Hall Blog] \u2014 ''by Dave Levinthal and Rudolph Bush''.\n\n{{Downtown Dallas}}\n{{I.

They are:\n\n===Race for atomic power exhibit at Idaho Falls===\nThe first [[nuclear reactor]] capable of producing usable amounts of electricity was [[Experimental Breeder Reactor I]], which lit up four light bulbs on December 20, 1951. This historical milestone is one of many captured in the Race for Atomic Power exhibit that opened on May 24, 2005 at the EBR-I. Upon entering the EBR-I, visitors can relax in a 1950s living room and watch TV. Clips from the 1950s as well as Nuclear Pioneers, a brief history of the EBR-I produced by the Atomic Heritage Foundation. Throughout the exhibit are kiosks with video recordings of the veterans explaining aspects of the reactor\u2019s operations. In the control room, Kirby Whitham explains when the misunderstanding of the command, \u201cTake it down,\u201d resulted in a partial meltdown of the reactor core. Blackboards present the fundamentals of nuclear fission and a cut-away diagram shows the inner workings of the reactor.  The exhibit was created under the supervision of the AHF and is now run by the Museum of Idaho.\n\n===B Reactor exhibits at Hanford===\nThis exhibit focuses on the [[Hanford Site]] and its role in the [[Manhattan Project]].  It feature exhibits on the [[B Reactor]] \u2014 the world's first plutonium production reactor \u2014 and its importance, models of the reactor and surrounding buildings, a documentary film (''Hanford's  Secret Wartime Mission''), and vignettes and education materials on the history of the Hanford site. The exhibit was developed in partnership with the B Reactor Museum Association, the Hanford Reach National Monument Heritage and Visitor Center, and the Columbia River Exposition on History, Science and Technology.\n\n==Books==\nThe Atomic Heritage Foundation has created several books dealing with the Manhattan Project.  They are:\n\n'''''The Manhattan Project: The Birth of the Atomic Bomb in the Words of Its Creators, Eyewitnesses, and Historians'':''' An anthology that collects the writings and thoughts of the original participants in the Manhattan Project, along with pieces by the most important historians and interpreters of the subject.\n\n'''''The Manhattan Project Guidebook Series'':''' A series of four guides to the Manhattan Project in [[Manhattan]], [[New Mexico]], [[Tennessee]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington State]]. The guidebooks relate the history and significance of the Manhattan Project in these areas.\n\n'''''Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project'':''' Edited by Cynthia Kelly, this book provides a spectrum of interpretations of [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]]'s life and scientific achievements. Contributors include the Hon. Senator [[Jeff Bingaman]], authors and historians [[Richard Rhodes]], [[Martin Sherwin]], [[Kai Bird]] and Robert S. Norris, and [[Andy Oppenheimer]].\n\n'''''Remembering the Manhattan Project'':''' Edited by Cynthia Kelly, part I of this book, comprising papers from the Atomic Heritage Foundation's Symposium on the Manhattan Project in Washington, DC on April 27, 2002, recounts the history of this remarkable effort and reflects upon its legacy. Contributors include [[Richard Rhodes]], Robert S. Norris, [[Martin Sherwin]] and [[Kai Bird]], Gregg Herken, [[James R. Schlesinger]], and others. Part II proposes a strategy for preserving the historical properties and artifacts of the Manhattan Project for the public and future generations.\n\n'''''Race for Atomic Power'':''' A companion book to the museum exhibit of the same name.\n\n==Films==\n'''''Hanford's Secret Wartime Mission'':''' This documentary film chronicles the story of the Manhattan Project at Hanford where the world's first plutonium production facilities were built along the Columbia River in eastern Washington state. The undertaking paired the University of Chicago's team of extraordinary physicists led by [[Enrico Fermi]] with the [[DuPont Company]]'s industrial expertise led by [[Crawford Greenewalt]]. The film highlights the determination, commitment, and scientific ingenuity of the men and women who took on the seemingly impossible task of producing plutonium in time to contribute to the war effort.\n\n'''''A Handful of Soldiers'':''' features three Manhattan Project veterans who describe their experiences at Los Alamos working on the plutonium-based bomb. The twelve-minute film shows the remains of the \"V Site\" where the first atomic bomb was assembled.\n\n'''''Nuclear Pioneers'':''' The 28-minute documentary film on the [[Experimental Breeder Reactor I]] (EBR-I) tells the story of the first nuclear reactor built by the Atomic Energy Commission. With first-hand accounts from scientists and engineers, the film explores the challenges of creating the world's first reactor to produce usable quantities of electricity and \"breed\" more fuel than it consumed. Completed in 1951, the EBR-I paved the way for future generations of \"peaceful\" reactors and was named a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1966 by President Johnson.\n\n'''''Interviews with Manhattan Project Veterans, Vol. I-III'':''' These films features interviews with seven Manhattan Project veterans. Complete with pictures from the Department of Energy's archives and short biographies of the veterans, the films describe what it was like to work on the top-secret project that changed world history and created a revolution in science and technology.\n\n'''''The Race for Atomic Power'':''' This documentary film traces the history of the [[National Reactor Testing Station]] in Idaho Falls, with interviews of former and current employees of NRTS and Idaho National Laboratory. These vignettes discuss the innovations developed at NRTS during its first 25 years.\n\n'''''General Leslie R. Groves'':''' A brief biography of General Leslie Groves, who built the Pentagon and then became the Manhattan Project's \"indispensable man.\"\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.atomicheritage.org Atomic Heritage Foundation Homepage]\n* [http://www.manhattanprojectvoices.org Voices of the Manhattan Project]\n\n;News stories:\n*{{cite news|author=[[William J.

The Atomic Heritage Foundation website is now run by the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History. Additionally, the museum now houses the Atomic Heritage Foundation's physical collections which will eventually be integrated into the Nuclear Museum's own collection.  \n\n==Voices of the Manhattan Project==\nIn November 2012, the Atomic Heritage Foundation (AHF) and the [[Los Alamos Historical Museum]] launched a new website, \"Voices of the Manhattan Project\" featuring their oral history collections. Together AHF and the Los Alamos Historical Museum have collected hundreds of oral histories over the years.\n\nThe interviews offer a variety of perspectives on the project. Some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] discuss the government\u2019s displacement of the tribes from their ancestral lands in [[Hanford, Washington]]. In others, [[Pueblo Indians]] in [[New Mexico]] talk about the impact of the government project on their ancestral traditions and economy. Veterans recall blowing off steam by hiking and skiing in [[Los Alamos, New Mexico|Los Alamos]], dancing and bowling in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]], and engaging in a meatball mess hall battle in Hanford.

They are:\n\n===Race for atomic power exhibit at Idaho Falls===\nThe first [[nuclear reactor]] capable of producing usable amounts of electricity was [[Experimental Breeder Reactor I]], which lit up four light bulbs on December 20, 1951. This historical milestone is one of many captured in the Race for Atomic Power exhibit that opened on May 24, 2005 at the EBR-I. Upon entering the EBR-I, visitors can relax in a 1950s living room and watch TV. Clips from the 1950s as well as Nuclear Pioneers, a brief history of the EBR-I produced by the Atomic Heritage Foundation. Throughout the exhibit are kiosks with video recordings of the veterans explaining aspects of the reactor\u2019s operations. In the control room, Kirby Whitham explains when the misunderstanding of the command, \u201cTake it down,\u201d resulted in a partial meltdown of the reactor core. Blackboards present the fundamentals of nuclear fission and a cut-away diagram shows the inner workings of the reactor.  The exhibit was created under the supervision of the AHF and is now run by the Museum of Idaho.\n\n===B Reactor exhibits at Hanford===\nThis exhibit focuses on the [[Hanford Site]] and its role in the [[Manhattan Project]].  It feature exhibits on the [[B Reactor]] \u2014 the world's first plutonium production reactor \u2014 and its importance, models of the reactor and surrounding buildings, a documentary film (''Hanford's  Secret Wartime Mission''), and vignettes and education materials on the history of the Hanford site.
