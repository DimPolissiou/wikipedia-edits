The show was a creation of [[Mark Goodson]]-[[Bill Todman]] Productions.\n\nThe show began on radio as ''Time's A-Wastin''' in 1948, hosted by [[Bud Collyer]], and changed its name to ''Beat the Time'' on January 5, 1949. The show moved to television on the [[CBS]] nighttime schedule starting on March 23, 1950. On September 16, 1957, CBS premiered an afternoon version of the show as well, which ran for a year. The nighttime show was cancelled on February 16, 1958, and the afternoon program followed on September 12, 1958.<ref name=Daytime>{{cite book |last1=Hyatt |first1=Wesley |title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television |date=1997 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |isbn=978-0823083152 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofda00hyat/page/54/mode/2up|accessdate=22 March 2020|pages=54-55}}</ref>\n\nSoon, the show moved to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] daytime schedule, and ran from October 13, 1958 to January 27, 1961. A brief revival aired on CBS from September 9, 1979 to February 1, 1980.<ref name=Daytime/>\n\nThe most recent revival premiered on [[Universal Kids]] on February 6, 2018.\n\n==1950\u20131961==\nThe first edition of ''Beat the Clock'' was a production of [[CBS]] and aired there until 1958. The show then moved to [[American Broadcasting Company]] where it stayed until 1961. [[Bud Collyer]] emceed the original series.\n\nContestants were required to perform tasks (called \"problems\" by Collyer) within a certain time limit which was counted down on a large 60-second [[clock]]. If they succeeded, they were said to have \"beaten the clock\"\u2014otherwise, \"the clock beat them\". The show had several sponsors over its run, with the most longstanding being the electronics company [[Sylvania Electric Products|Sylvania]].\n\n===On-air personalities===\nSubstitute hosts on the original version included Bill Hart (1951), [[John Reed King]] (1952), stunt creator [[Frank Wayne]] (1953), Bob Kennedy (1954), [[Win Elliot]] (1955), and [[Sonny Fox]], who became Collyer's permanent substitute from 1957 to 1960. Collyer was referred to in the introductions as \"America's number one clockwatcher\", and the fill-in hosts were each named \"America's number two clockwatcher\".\n[[File:Beat the Clock 1958.JPG|thumb|180px|Bud Collyer as the show's host, 1958.]]\nThe show had several female on-air assistants. The original hostess was [[Roxanne (model)|Roxanne]] (n\u00e9e Delores Evelyn Rosedale). Roxanne was replaced by [[Beverly Bentley]] in August 1955. Bentley's departure in 1956 coincided with Hazel Bishop's sponsorship and a period of having no main assistant (see production changes below). She reappeared as one of the models on the original version of ''[[The Price Is Right (1956 U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' for its entire run.\n\nThe announcer for the show's run on CBS was Bernard (\"Bern\") Bennett until 1958. In October 1957, ''Beat the Clock'' ran a contest inviting viewers to submit drawings of what Bennett, who was never shown on camera, might look like. Over 20,000 viewers participated, and winner Edward Darnell, of [[Columbus, Indiana]], was flown in to appear with Bennett on the December 2, 1957, show. When ''Beat the Clock'' moved to ABC, Dirk Fredericks became the announcer. Substitute announcers included Lee Vines, [[Bob Sheppard]], [[Hal Simms]], and Dick Noel.\n\n===Contestants===\nContestants were chosen from the studio audience and usually were married couples. Other pairs were engaged, dating, or were a familial relationship. Collyer would ask them general questions (usually including where they were from and how long they'd been married) and usually asked if they had children, their ages and genders. Sometimes the couple would bring children on the show. Collyer usually would talk to the children, asking them what they wanted to be when they grew up, or, if the kids were not at the show, to have their parents wave to them on TV. The husbands on the show usually wore a [[business suit]]. Collyer would often ask the husband to take off his coat for stunts to make it less cumbersome (there were hooks on the contestants' podium) or Collyer would hold the coat.\n\nOccasionally, if there was going to be a messy stunt, the husband would come out dressed in a plastic jumpsuit. Similarly, wives would sometimes play in their \"street clothes\", but sometimes the women would appear in a jumpsuit because their own clothing might be too cumbersome or perhaps fragile. The women's jumpsuits, unlike the men's, which were rather plain, were patterned to look like a pair of [[overalls]] with a collared [[blouse]] underneath. The women would also often be issued running shoes instead of their own [[high heels]].\n\n===Game format===\n\n====Main Game====\nOne couple competed against the clock to win a prize in stunts that required one or both members of the couple. The stunt was described and the time limit was set on a giant onstage clock. The time limit was always a multiple of 5 seconds, usually at least 30 seconds. At one point Collyer said that a 55-second time limit was the maximum, but later on, stunts occasionally had 60-second limits. On the primetime edition, the first stunt was called the $100 clock. If the couple beat the $100 clock, they moved on to the $200 clock and the same rules applied. If they failed to beat the $100 clock, they received a consolation prize worth less than $100. If they failed to beat the $200 clock, they got a prize worth more than $100. On the daytime versions, couples continued playing as long as they kept beating the clock.\n\n====Jackpot Clock====\nOn the primetime version, if the couple beat the $200 clock, the wife would play the jackpot clock in which the words of a famous saying or quote were scrambled up on a magnetic board and that phrase had to be unscrambled in 20 seconds or less. If successful, then the couple won the Jackpot Prize. If not, they got a prize worth more than $200. Occasionally, when the wife of the couple did not speak English very well, the husband was allowed to perform the jackpot clock.\n\nThe jackpot clock and the Bonus Stunt would provide the templates for the traditional quiz show bonus round, which would become a TV staple, starting in 1950 with the bonus question round on ''[[You Bet Your Life]]''.\n\nIn the show's earliest set design in available episodes, there was a round display near the contestants mirroring the clock. This display had three rings of light like a target. The outer ring would light during the $100 clock, the middle ring for the $200 clock, and the center circle would light during the jackpot clock. This feature was removed in later set designs.\n\n====Bonus Stunt====\nSome time during every episode (between normal stunts), a bell would sound. The couple playing at the time would attempt the Bonus Stunt for the Bonus Prize that started at $100 in cash. If the stunt was not beaten, it would be attempted the next week with $100 added to the prize. When it was beaten, it was retired from the show and a new Bonus Stunt began the next week at $100. The bonus (as the name suggests) did not affect the regular game, and win or lose the couple continued the regular clocks wherever they left off. Beginning in August 1954, the starting amount for each Bonus Stunt was raised to $500, still increasing $100 each week.\n\nBonus Stunts were harder than the usual $100 and $200 clocks and sometimes reached $2,000 and even $3,000 on rare occasions. The first time the Bonus reached $1,000 was on February 28, 1953, when it was won for that amount. In 1956, the Bonus Stunt was replaced by the Super Bonus.\n\nThere was usually a special technique for performing the stunt that had to be figured out, but even then, the stunt was usually difficult enough to require some skill or luck once the technique was realized. Viewers would usually try to figure it out and after a few weeks on the air viewers would often get it (sometimes Collyer would remark that viewers had been writing in and he would give certain dimensions of the props used so viewers could try to figure it out at home).\n\nUsually either contestants themselves would start appearing on the show with the technique in mind, or audience members would shout it out to try to help them. A stunt would usually take a few weeks before the audience realized the technique, and then a few more weeks before someone was able to properly employ it.\n\n====Super Bonus Stunt====\nIn response to the big money prizes on other networks' game shows, CBS talked Mark Goodson into increasing the stakes on ''Beat The Clock''. Ultimately the plan was unsuccessful as the ratings never did improve much, perhaps leading to the end of the Super Bonus. Starting on February 25, 1956, after the last regular Bonus Stunt had been won, it was replaced by the super bonus which started at $10,000 and went up by $1,000 every time a couple failed to beat the clock. Unlike with the regular bonus stunt and the \"Big Cash Bonus Stunt\" that followed it, the Super Bonus was attempted by every couple who qualified by beating the $200 clock. Originally the stunt was played at the end of the show by each couple that qualified, and \"because of the high prize value\" a special timing machine made by the [[Longines]] company was used, which was touted as the most accurate portable timer available. Probably realizing that seeing the same stunt a few times in a row was a bit boring, they moved the Super Bonus right after the $200 clock and before the jackpot clock on March 17, dropping the Longines timer.\n\nPartway through the run of the second Super Bonus, a rolling desk/table with dollar value of the bonus printed on it was used to roll out the props for the stunt. This carried over to the Big Cash Bonus Stunt. It is notable that in the earliest surviving episodes from 1952 that air, the original bonus had a similar desk with the value of the bonus on it. The desk was done away with for several years until the idea was reused in 1956.\n\n====Big Cash Bonus Stunt====\nStarting on September 22, 1956, the bonus reverted to the original Bonus Stunt format (attempted once per episode by whatever couple heard the \"bonus bell\" ringing). The Jackpot started at $5,000 and increased $1,000 every week it was not won. If successful, the couple left the show with the top prize. Otherwise, they continued on with the regular game.\n\n====Bonus Cash and Prize Stunt====\nFeatured on the daytime version. A lucky couple had a chance to win a bundle of cash and their choice of a new car or boat. To win, they had to successfully complete their Bonus Stunt. Like the original Bonus Stunt, the cash value started at $100, going up each time the stunt was not successfully completed. The largest cash bonus won on the daytime edition was $20,100 during its years on ABC.\n\n===Stunts===\nThe stunts performed on the show were mostly created by staff stunt writers Frank Wayne and Bob Howard. In the early days of the show, playwright [[Neil Simon]] was also a stunt writer. The stunts were usually aimed towards fun with difficulty being secondary. The stunts would usually be constructed out of common household props such as cardboard boxes, string, balloons, record players, dishes, cups, plates, cutlery, and balls of almost every type. As was the case with many other game shows during television's infancy, the budget was low.\n\nThe stunts performed varied widely, but there were some common themes. Most stunts in some way involved physical speed or dexterity. Contestants often had to balance something with some part of their body, or race back and forth on the stage (for example, releasing a balloon, running across the stage to do some task, and running back in time to catch the balloon before it floated too high). Often the challenge was some form of [[target practice]], in terms of throwing, rolling, bowling, etc.\n\nThe setup for the stunt was often designed to look easy but then have a complication or [[gimmick]] revealed. For example, Collyer would say \"All you have to do is stack four plates\", check the clock to see how much time they had to do it, and then add \"Oh, and one more thing...you can't use your hands\". Common twists included blindfolding one or both contestants, or telling them they could not use their hands (or feet or any body part that would be obvious to use for whatever the task was).\n\nThe other common element in the stunts was to get one of the contestants messy in some way often involving whipped cream, pancake batter, and such (usually limited to the husband of the couple). While it was not a part of every stunt, and sometimes it didn't even happen in an episode, it was common enough that when a couple brought a child on, Collyer would often ask what they thought the parents might have to do and the child would often respond \"get whipped cream in their face\". Many times the wife would be shown a task, be blindfolded, and then her husband would be quietly brought out and unknown to her she would be covering him with some sort of mess. When the mess was not hidden from the wife, Collyer would often jokingly tell the husband (who usually had a short haircut) that they would put a bathing cap on his head \"to keep your long hair out of your eyes\" before revealing what form of mess he would be involved with. Occasionally Collyer himself would get caught in the mess accidentally.\n\nTechnicality in the rules was not a major issue on the show. The goal was usually to make sure the contestants had fun. Collyer would often stop the clock in the middle of a stunt if the contestant(s) was struggling so he advised them on a better way to do the stunt. Often if a condition of the stunt was \"don't use your hands,\" Collyer would ignore the first use of hands and just warn the contestant. If the time limit was nearly up on a task, he would often give them a few moments extra, or tell them if they started before the clock ran out and succeeded in that attempt, he would count it. Sometimes if a contestant had come close enough (for example, if they had to stack cups and saucers without the pile falling over, and the contestant knocked the pile over while putting the last cup on top), he would give them the stunt if they did not have time to do it again. If there was a problem with a prop breaking or running out of a supply, such as balloons, Collyer would simply give the stunt to the couple, citing it as the show's fault. Similarly, on the messy stunts, since the goal was just to mess up the husband, the time limit was often unimportant and the clock would be stopped when Bud felt the husband was messy enough.\n\n===Prizes===\nPrizes varied depending on the era of the show and the sponsor at the time. During Sylvania's tenure as sponsor (which began in March 1951), consolation prizes for losing the $100 clock were usually a Sylvania radio.\n* $100 clock prizes included Michael C. Fina silverware sets, a collection of four Knapp-Monarch small kitchen appliances, or a [[The Hoover Company|Hoover]] [[vacuum cleaner|upright]], among others.\n* $200 clock prizes included International-Harvester refrigerators, air conditioning units (usually in the summer), a [[Tappan (brand)|Tappan]] range/oven, a James dishwasher, [[Speed Queen]] washers and dryers (for some reason, they were only offered separately) and small Sylvania TVs. All of these prizes, except the Sylvania radio, were shown on \"art cards\" and not actually brought out on the show.\n* The Jackpot Prize during Sylvania's tenure was always a Sylvania [[television set]]. Sometimes a [[hi-fi]] stereo/phonograph (with \"famous surround sound\") was included with the television, and it was noted that the Jackpot Prize was \"worth more than $500\". A notable (and often pointed out) feature of Sylvania's TVs at the time was the \"halo light\", which was an illuminated \"frame\" around the image which was supposed to have made watching the image easier on the eyes, similar to [[Philips]]' \"AmbiLight\" feature on television sets today.\n\nThe sets, as was the style at the time, were freestanding pieces of furniture that sat on legs on the floor with a speaker mounted below the screen. Various models were given away over the years\u2014sometimes the same model several times in one episode, sometimes a different model each time the Jackpot was won in an episode. Roxanne (later Beverly) would pose with the TV which was revealed from behind a curtain in a small faux living room.\n\nThere were also various gifts given to the contestants just for appearing on the show. There was a Sylvania ''Beat the Clock'' home game produced which was given to contestants starting in the mid-50s. When it was novel, Collyer would open the box and explain that it would be fun for not just children but adults at parties, and he would point out the working clock and the instructions for stunts and all the props. Later in the run it would be brought out, shown and whisked away just as quickly. The boxes were reworked a few times, and there was a new edition released later in the run. Both versions were manufactured by Lowell Toy Mfg. Co. of New York, who produced a number of television-based home games at the time.\n\nWhen children were brought on the show, there were special gifts. Starting on September 6, 1952, girls brought on the show were given a Roxanne doll that was produced at the time. On October 11, 1952, the [[Buck Rogers]] Space Ranger Kit was debuted for boys. In the mid-50s, each child was given a camera kit.\n\nIf contestants were involved in a messy stunt, Roxanne (later Beverly) would come out and take a picture. Initially it wasn't made clear how the couple would get the photo (perhaps mailed to them), but later in the run, the camera would be given to the couple in addition to any their children might already have been given. Collyer would explain that when they developed the film, the first photo would be that of the husband/couple.\n\nFrom 1956 and for the rest of the show's run on CBS, the Jackpot Prizes usually consisted of a [[Magnavox]] Color TV, [[Fedders]] air conditioners (usually awarded as a pair), [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation (1886)|Westinghouse]] washer & dryer pairs, and refrigerators, [[Hardwick (appliances)|Hardwick]] ranges, [[Whirpool Corporation|Whirlpool]] freezers, and Easy \"Combomatic\" combination washer-dryers.\n\n==1969\u20131974==\nOn September 15, 1969, ''Beat the Clock'' returned to television in five-day-a-week syndication. This series continued to air until September 20, 1974. For the first season (1969\u20131970), the show was taped at [[Helen Hayes Theatre|The Little Theatre]] on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in New York City, sharing the stage with [[The Merv Griffin Show]] and [[The David Frost Show]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eyesofageneration.com/the-little-theater-240-west-44th-street-in-midtown-manhattannow-known-as-th/?post_id=31118&comments=2&get=30&order=DESC|title=The Little Theater: 240 West 44th Street in Midtown Manhattan \u2013 Eyes Of A Generation\u2026Television's Living History}}</ref> After that, taping moved to [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] as a cost-saving measure. This was the only time Goodson-Todman taped a series in Canada that was not for a Canadian-specific audience. The show was broadcast by [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] in Canada.\n\n[[Jack Narz]] hosted the first three seasons of the series before leaving and his announcer, [[Gene Wood]], replaced him for the remainder of the run.\n\nThe music for this version of ''Beat the Clock'' was played live on the organ by keyboardist and arranger [[Dick Hyman]].\n\n===Jack Narz (1969\u20131972)===\nIn early episodes, couples, now aided by a weekly celebrity guest, played for points simply by completing stunts. The first couple to reach 100 points won a prize package. This was subsequently changed to the couples receiving a prize every time they won, which was later replaced by the winning couple facing a \"cash board\" with \"BEAT THE CLOCK\" spelled out on three levels, each letter concealing a money amount: either $25 (4), $50 (5), $100 (2), or $200. The couple would agree on a letter, select it, and the winnings would be revealed.\n\nIn addition, if a couple completed a stunt in less than half the time, the remaining time would be used for awarding a cash bonus. Anywhere from $10 to $50 would be awarded for each time the stunt was completed in the time remaining.\n\nAt some point during the show, the celebrity would perform a \"Solo Stunt\" (which seemed to have supplanted the Bonus Stunt on the original show). The couples won $50 if they guessed correctly whether the star could beat the clock or vice versa. Towards the end of Narz' tenure as host, stunts would be replaced in the second half of the show with the celebrity playing a game of intuition with the couples, who would play for a cash prize that was divided among them.\n\nDuring this time, the show was syndicated through [[20th Century Fox Television]].  One curious aspect of this version of the show was that Narz' suit jackets sported an embroidered patch of the show's ''Beat The Clock'' logo sewn onto the left breast.  This practice was similar to hosts [[Jim Lange]] and [[Bob Eubanks]]' wearing logo patches from ''[[The Dating Game]]'' and ''[[The Newlywed Game]]'' respectively, and also the scrambled \"mystery logo\" seen on Hugh Downs' (and later Bob Clayton's) blazer when they hosted [[Concentration (game show)|Concentration]].\n\n===Gene Wood (1972\u20131974)===\nJack Narz left the show in 1972. At the time, he made no announcement and gave no reason for his departure. In a 2007 [[Internet radio]] interview, Narz finally explained that the show's budget did not include his personal travel expenses. Narz had to pay for his travel, and the cost of airline fare between his Los Angeles home and Montreal became prohibitive. His travel costs were essentially equal to his earnings, and even a successful appeal to Mark Goodson for more money was not enough.\n\nAnnouncer Gene Wood hosted the show for the next two seasons. Wood had also been hosting a similar stunt game titled ''[[Anything You Can Do (game show)|Anything You Can Do]]'', a battle of the sexes competition which was also recorded in Canada. [[CFCF-TV]] Montreal staff announcer Nick Holenreich became the show's announcer (he had previously announced for a week during Narz's final season in which Wood was the celebrity guest). At this time, the show also changed syndicators to Firestone Syndication Services, which syndicated another Goodson-Todman show, ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'', which had originally been hosted by Bud Collyer.\n\nThe show was now called ''The New Beat the Clock'' (although the logo still read simply \"Beat the Clock\"), and the set was refreshed with a new color scheme and a redesigned clock. Like his predecessor, Wood also wore suit jackets with the show's logo sewn on the pockets.\n\nThe only changes in the format were that couples were introduced separately and played two stunts, win or lose (a win still getting a trip to the Cash Board), and both couples competed simultaneously in a final stunt, with the winning couple receiving a prize. Celebrity guests were retained in the new format, once again aiding the contestants, and performing the Solo Stunt as well as \"co-judge\" with Wood in the final stunt of the day. Another throwback to the Collyer era (when the show was seen in the daytime) was the revival of \"Ladies' Day\", where women only (not counting the celebrity for that week) would play the game.\n\nDespite continued popularity on local stations in both daytime and [[Prime Time Access Rule|prime time access]] timeslots, Goodson-Todman decided to discontinue production of ''Beat the Clock'' in 1974 when CTV asked the company for half of the proceeds from advertisers awarding their wares as contestant consolation prizes. Wood returned to voice-over work, and went on to a 20-year career announcing [[Los Angeles]]-based shows for Goodson-Todman and occasionally other packagers.\n\n===Episode status===\nSome episodes of this series are intact and have aired on [[Game Show Network|GSN]]. Two episodes from the Narz era were aired in late 2005 to pay tribute to [[Bob Denver]] and [[Louis Nye]], both of whom had recently died. An episode featuring [[Tom Kennedy (television presenter)|Tom Kennedy]] (Narz's brother) aired on June 11, 2007.\n\nIn January 2007, a Gene Wood episode aired which featured [[William Shatner]]. Another episode aired on October 22, 2007, featuring [[Dick Clark]]. At least three episodes were also aired featuring [[Richard Dawson]].\n\n==1979\u20131980==\nIn 1979, CBS elected to bring the series back as ''All-New Beat the Clock'' for its daytime schedule. Production moved to [[CBS Television City]], taping in Studio 31 and marking the only time a ''Beat the Clock'' series originated from Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shows\u2013CBS Television City|url=http://www.cbstelevisioncity.com/shows#|accessdate=July 25, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713152856/http://www.cbstelevisioncity.com/shows|archivedate=July 13, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The series premiered on September 17, 1979, at 10:00{{nbsp}}a.m., replacing reruns of ''[[All in the Family]]'' in the time period, preceding ''[[Whew!]]''. [[Monty Hall]], who had not hosted a game show [[Stefan Hatos-Monty Hall Productions|his company]] did not produce since he was host of Heatter-Quigley's ''[[Video Village]]'', was the emcee for the series while former host of the 1970s syndicated series, Jack Narz, served as his announcer and a series producer. The show faced competition from NBC's ''[[Card Sharks]]'' (ABC did not start programming until 11:00{{nbsp}}a.m.)\n\nThere were two theme songs used (both composed by [[Score Productions]]). The second one was performed live in the studio by a small band led by [[Arthur B. Rubinstein]].\n\nTwo couples, one usually a returning champion, competed against each other and the clock. The champion couple (or champion-designate if the previous episode had ended with a retiring champion couple) wore red sweaters while the opposing couple wore green.\n\n===Rounds 1 and 2===\nThe first two rounds began with the couples competing against each other in a stunt worth $500 for the winner. One stunt usually featured the women of the couples, while the other featured the men, though the other partner sometimes had to help as well. The stunts were conducted for 60 seconds and were either races against the clock to perform an objective or competitions to outscore the opponent in the stunt before the clock ran out. In the former case, the clock was run as a fail safe, and if neither couple managed to complete the stunt, the team furthest along won.\n\nHall would then bring the winning couple across the stage to compete in a stunt by themselves for an additional $500. After Hall described the stunt and what both partners had to do, the clock was set and the couple had to complete the stunt in the allotted time. Doing so won the $500, but failure to do so did not.\n\n===Bonus Shuffle===\nAfter the first two rounds, both teams squared off in a modified [[table shuffleboard]] game called the \"Bonus Shuffle\".\n\nThe teams took turns throwing pucks down the shuffleboard table. The team leading had the advantage of throwing three pucks and going first. If there was a tie, a coin was tossed with the winners going first and there were only two pucks per side. The table had eight stripes on it, and each stripe had a higher dollar amount on it. The first stripe was worth $300 and each subsequent stripe was worth $100 more, with the stripe at the very end of the table worth $1,000. There was just enough space in between the stripes where a puck could land and not score any money. Pucks had to remain on the table to count, and if a puck failed to reach the first stripe it was taken off the board and discarded. The teams were allowed to try to knock each other's pucks off the board if they so desired but did so at their own risk, as they could just as easily knock their own puck off the board or push a puck up the board and onto a higher value.\n\nThe team whose puck was furthest along on the board after all pucks had been thrown won the money attached to the space their puck was touching and became the day's champions. They then moved on to play the Bonus Stunt for ten times the amount of their Bonus Shuffle total. In the event of a tie, each team threw one puck. The first puck's landing spot was marked and the other team had to beat the mark to win.\n\n===Bonus Stunt===\nThe Bonus Stunt round was conducted the same way as the solo stunts were. Hall would give the objective of the Bonus Stunt to the champion couple, then the clock would be set and the couple had to complete the stunt before time ran out. If they did so, as previously mentioned, they won ten times their Bonus Shuffle score for a maximum of $10,000 and a new Bonus Stunt would be played on the next show. If a Bonus Stunt was played five consecutive times without a couple managing to complete it, the stunt would be replaced with a new one.\n\nCouples continued to appear until they were either defeated or surpassed $25,000 in total winnings. A team could win up to $13,000 in one day if they managed to win all four stunts in the main game, score $1,000 in the Bonus Shuffle, and win the Bonus Stunt.\n\n===''The All-New All-Star Beat The Clock''===\nOn November 5, 1979, the show switched to an all-celebrity format. The changes that were made included:\n* Celebrity pairs played for designated rooting sections of the audience which split the winnings. (Also, someone in \"the winning rooting section\" won a set of prizes, which were the \"consolation prizes\" in the non-celebrity part of the run.)\n* Both rooting sections could be seen on-camera.\n* Stunts in the first two rounds were only worth $250 for the rooting sections.\n* If the winning team completed the bonus stunt, $1,000 went to their rooting section while the remaining money went to their favorite charity (thus, the most money a celebrity team could win for their rooting section in a single day was $3,000 and a possible $9,000 to their charity).\n* Both star teams remained on the show for a week. The pairings stayed the same on four of the five days, with the teams changing colors (the red team on Monday and Thursday was the green team on Tuesday and Friday). On Wednesdays, the teams switched, although still one man and one woman per team.\n* In case of a tie going into the Bonus Shuffle, a coin toss determined who went first.\n* In the last two weeks of the run, after each head-to-head stunt, both teams got to perform the next stunt, with the losing team from the previous stunt going first. If both teams performed this stunt within the time limit, whoever did it faster got the $250.\n* The theme song was now an upbeat version of the first one used in its run (it was previously used going into and out of the commercials of the earlier episodes), and was performed live in the studio.\n\n===Episode status===\nThis series exists in its entirety. The Christmas episode with [[Ronnie Schell]], [[Joyce Bulifant]], [[Johnny Brown (actor)|Johnny Brown]], and [[Patti Deutsch]] has aired on GSN in the past during Christmas-themed marathons. The series aired on GSN between September 10, 2007, and September 2008 in a late Saturday and Sunday night slot but was pulled from the schedule after beginning the final week. On November 12, 2008, it returned to the GSN lineup weeknights at 2:00{{nbsp}}a.m., replacing ''[[Trivia Trap]]''. It last aired January 3, 2009.\n\n[[Buzzr]] has also carried the Hall version of ''Beat the Clock'' on a sporadic basis.\n\n==2002\u20132003==\nThis version, the show's previous appearance other than the ''[[Gameshow Marathon (U.S. TV series)|Gameshow Marathon]]'' special, aired daily from September 2, 2002, to September 4, 2003, on [[PAX TV]] (the first week of shows was called a \"preview week\"). Taped in [[Universal Studios Florida]], three couples competed in this version with no returning champions. The couples were distinguished by color\u2014red, blue, and gold.\n\n===Round 1===\nTo start the game, all three couples faced off in a stunt. The first couple to complete the stunt got 10 points and the advantage of having to play a 30-second solo stunt first, as well as the ability to assign the stunts to the other teams- prior to gameplay the couple was shown 3 items on a tray that represented the stunts themselves, picked one for themselves to play, and divided the other two among the remaining players.\n\nBefore the playing of each stunt, a two-part trivia question was asked. Answering it correctly gave the team 10 extra seconds to complete the stunt and both parts had to be answered correctly, one by each player, in order to get those 10 seconds. 10 points were given for completing the stunt with one additional point for each second remaining on the clock (for example, if a couple completed a stunt with three seconds remaining, they scored 13 points for the round).\n\n===Round 2===\nThe second round consisted of two parts. The first part was another face-off stunt, i.e. trying to throw a ring around a pole the other player is wearing on their head. In a stunt like this, the first place couple's ring tosser would be closest to their partner, the second place couple would be slightly further back, and the third place couple would be the furthest back (the first place couple was always given an advantage, with the second having less of one and the third the least). Play continued until two of the couples completed the stunt, with those two teams continuing on.\n\nThe two remaining couples were then shown the stunt they would have to attempt. After the stunt was described, another trivia question was asked. In this case, the female half of the couple was given the option to answer it, have her partner answer it, or pass it to the other team to make them answer. If the couple answered correctly they would be given control, but if they did not the opponents did. The two couples then bid down from a base time of two minutes to see who could complete the stunt in the fastest amount of time, and bidding continued until one team challenged the other to beat the clock. The stunt was then played, and if the challenged couple completed it they won the game and advanced to the bonus game. If they were not successful, the challenging couple won the game.\n\n===Bonus Round (\"The Swirling Whirlwind of Cash and Prizes\")===\nThe winning couple played the \"Swirling Whirlwind of Cash and Prizes\", which took place inside a machine similar to a [[vertical wind tunnel]]. $25,000 in cash was inside the machine, as well as several \"prize vouchers\" (coloured slips of paper with the names of prizes written on them). Several more vouchers would be tossed into the machine prior to the start of the round.\n\nOnce inside the machine, both players tried to grab as much money and prize vouchers as they could within a 1-minute time limit. There were three standing rules- both players could grab items but they had to be placed in a bag worn around the male partner's waist, they couldn't bend over and pick up anything off the floor (although they could kick items off the floor into the air), and once the buzzer sounded, they had to put their hands up and stop. Later in the run, several [[gold certificate]]s were added to the machine and if the couple picked one up, the cash they had grabbed would be doubled. (If the couple somehow picked up more than one, only one was counted.)\n\nThe \"swirling whirlwind\" was previously used in the bonus round of ''[[The Diamond Head Game]]'', a show hosted by [[Bob Eubanks]] in 1975.\n\n== 2018 ==\nOn October 12, 2017, [[Universal Kids]] announced that it had ordered a revival of ''Beat the Clock'' from FremantleMedia North America, which premiered on February 6, 2018. The new version, (taped in Los Angeles, making it the second version taped there) features children and adults competing as teams and was hosted by Paul Costabile.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/programming/fremantlemedia-na-sells-two-game-shows-universal-kids/169285|title=FremantleMedia N.A.

There are three rounds of stunts. \n\nThe first round is worth $100/stunt and the second round is worth $150/stunt. The third and final round is a head-to-head challenge for $300 for a possible grand total of $550. Both teams get to keep the cash, but the team with the most money at the end of round three wins the game and goes on to try and Beat The Big Clock for over $2,000 if the losing team not win any money than they got consolation prize .  In the event of a tie, whoever completes the task first, or does the most tasks within the time limit in the head to head wins.  If neither teams complete the challenge and are still tied, whoever has the most money wins.\n\n===The Big Clock===\nThe winning team has 60 seconds to complete one final four-part stunt. Each part completed is worth $250, and completing all four parts wins the team $2,000, along with a $1,000 donation to a children's charity of the team's choice because paul always says that because they spread the love \nhere if not than the money they won earlier plus $250 they won from the stunts they did complete the donation Is not given to anyone who loses\n\n==International versions==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:98%;\"\n|-\n!

The show was a creation of [[Mark Goodson]]-[[Bill Todman]] Productions.\n\nThe show began on radio as ''Time's A-Wastin''' in 1948, hosted by [[Bud Collyer]], and changed its name to ''Beat the Time'' on January 5, 1949. The show moved to television on the [[CBS]] nighttime schedule starting on March 23, 1950. On September 16, 1957, CBS premiered an afternoon version of the show as well, which ran for a year. The nighttime show was cancelled on February 16, 1958, and the afternoon program followed on September 12, 1958.<ref name=Daytime>{{cite book |last1=Hyatt |first1=Wesley |title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television |date=1997 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |isbn=978-0823083152 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofda00hyat/page/54/mode/2up|accessdate=22 March 2020|pages=54-55}}</ref>\n\nSoon, the show moved to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] daytime schedule, and ran from October 13, 1958 to January 27, 1961. A brief revival aired on CBS from September 9, 1979 to February 1, 1980.<ref name=Daytime/>\n\nThe most recent revival premiered on [[Universal Kids]] on February 6, 2018.\n\n==1950\u20131961==\nThe first edition of ''Beat the Clock'' was a production of [[CBS]] and aired there until 1958. The show then moved to [[American Broadcasting Company]] where it stayed until 1961. [[Bud Collyer]] emceed the original series.\n\nContestants were required to perform tasks (called \"problems\" by Collyer) within a certain time limit which was counted down on a large 60-second [[clock]]. If they succeeded, they were said to have \"beaten the clock\"\u2014otherwise, \"the clock beat them\". The show had several sponsors over its run, with the most longstanding being the electronics company [[Sylvania Electric Products|Sylvania]].\n\n===On-air personalities===\nSubstitute hosts on the original version included Bill Hart (1951), [[John Reed King]] (1952), stunt creator [[Frank Wayne]] (1953), Bob Kennedy (1954), [[Win Elliot]] (1955), and [[Sonny Fox]], who became Collyer's permanent substitute from 1957 to 1960. Collyer was referred to in the introductions as \"America's number one clockwatcher\", and the fill-in hosts were each named \"America's number two clockwatcher\".\n[[File:Beat the Clock 1958.JPG|thumb|180px|Bud Collyer as the show's host, 1958.]]\nThe show had several female on-air assistants. The original hostess was [[Roxanne (model)|Roxanne]] (n\u00e9e Delores Evelyn Rosedale). Roxanne was replaced by [[Beverly Bentley]] in August 1955. Bentley's departure in 1956 coincided with Hazel Bishop's sponsorship and a period of having no main assistant (see production changes below). She reappeared as one of the models on the original version of ''[[The Price Is Right (1956 U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' for its entire run.\n\nThe announcer for the show's run on CBS was Bernard (\"Bern\") Bennett until 1958. In October 1957, ''Beat the Clock'' ran a contest inviting viewers to submit drawings of what Bennett, who was never shown on camera, might look like. Over 20,000 viewers participated, and winner Edward Darnell, of [[Columbus, Indiana]], was flown in to appear with Bennett on the December 2, 1957, show. When ''Beat the Clock'' moved to ABC, Dirk Fredericks became the announcer. Substitute announcers included Lee Vines, [[Bob Sheppard]], [[Hal Simms]], and Dick Noel.\n\n===Contestants===\nContestants were chosen from the studio audience and usually were married couples. Other pairs were engaged, dating, or were a familial relationship. Collyer would ask them general questions (usually including where they were from and how long they'd been married) and usually asked if they had children, their ages and genders. Sometimes the couple would bring children on the show. Collyer usually would talk to the children, asking them what they wanted to be when they grew up, or, if the kids were not at the show, to have their parents wave to them on TV. The husbands on the show usually wore a [[business suit]]. Collyer would often ask the husband to take off his coat for stunts to make it less cumbersome (there were hooks on the contestants' podium) or Collyer would hold the coat.\n\nOccasionally, if there was going to be a messy stunt, the husband would come out dressed in a plastic jumpsuit. Similarly, wives would sometimes play in their \"street clothes\", but sometimes the women would appear in a jumpsuit because their own clothing might be too cumbersome or perhaps fragile. The women's jumpsuits, unlike the men's, which were rather plain, were patterned to look like a pair of [[overalls]] with a collared [[blouse]] underneath. The women would also often be issued running shoes instead of their own [[high heels]].\n\n===Game format===\n\n====Main Game====\nOne couple competed against the clock to win a prize in stunts that required one or both members of the couple. The stunt was described and the time limit was set on a giant onstage clock. The time limit was always a multiple of 5 seconds, usually at least 30 seconds. At one point Collyer said that a 55-second time limit was the maximum, but later on, stunts occasionally had 60-second limits. On the primetime edition, the first stunt was called the $100 clock. If the couple beat the $100 clock, they moved on to the $200 clock and the same rules applied. If they failed to beat the $100 clock, they received a consolation prize worth less than $100. If they failed to beat the $200 clock, they got a prize worth more than $100. On the daytime versions, couples continued playing as long as they kept beating the clock.\n\n====Jackpot Clock====\nOn the primetime version, if the couple beat the $200 clock, the wife would play the jackpot clock in which the words of a famous saying or quote were scrambled up on a magnetic board and that phrase had to be unscrambled in 20 seconds or less. If successful, then the couple won the Jackpot Prize. If not, they got a prize worth more than $200. Occasionally, when the wife of the couple did not speak English very well, the husband was allowed to perform the jackpot clock.\n\nThe jackpot clock and the Bonus Stunt would provide the templates for the traditional quiz show bonus round, which would become a TV staple, starting in 1950 with the bonus question round on ''[[You Bet Your Life]]''.\n\nIn the show's earliest set design in available episodes, there was a round display near the contestants mirroring the clock. This display had three rings of light like a target. The outer ring would light during the $100 clock, the middle ring for the $200 clock, and the center circle would light during the jackpot clock. This feature was removed in later set designs.\n\n====Bonus Stunt====\nSome time during every episode (between normal stunts), a bell would sound. The couple playing at the time would attempt the Bonus Stunt for the Bonus Prize that started at $100 in cash. If the stunt was not beaten, it would be attempted the next week with $100 added to the prize. When it was beaten, it was retired from the show and a new Bonus Stunt began the next week at $100. The bonus (as the name suggests) did not affect the regular game, and win or lose the couple continued the regular clocks wherever they left off. Beginning in August 1954, the starting amount for each Bonus Stunt was raised to $500, still increasing $100 each week.\n\nBonus Stunts were harder than the usual $100 and $200 clocks and sometimes reached $2,000 and even $3,000 on rare occasions. The first time the Bonus reached $1,000 was on February 28, 1953, when it was won for that amount. In 1956, the Bonus Stunt was replaced by the Super Bonus.\n\nThere was usually a special technique for performing the stunt that had to be figured out, but even then, the stunt was usually difficult enough to require some skill or luck once the technique was realized. Viewers would usually try to figure it out and after a few weeks on the air viewers would often get it (sometimes Collyer would remark that viewers had been writing in and he would give certain dimensions of the props used so viewers could try to figure it out at home).\n\nUsually either contestants themselves would start appearing on the show with the technique in mind, or audience members would shout it out to try to help them. A stunt would usually take a few weeks before the audience realized the technique, and then a few more weeks before someone was able to properly employ it.\n\n====Super Bonus Stunt====\nIn response to the big money prizes on other networks' game shows, CBS talked Mark Goodson into increasing the stakes on ''Beat The Clock''. Ultimately the plan was unsuccessful as the ratings never did improve much, perhaps leading to the end of the Super Bonus. Starting on February 25, 1956, after the last regular Bonus Stunt had been won, it was replaced by the super bonus which started at $10,000 and went up by $1,000 every time a couple failed to beat the clock. Unlike with the regular bonus stunt and the \"Big Cash Bonus Stunt\" that followed it, the Super Bonus was attempted by every couple who qualified by beating the $200 clock. Originally the stunt was played at the end of the show by each couple that qualified, and \"because of the high prize value\" a special timing machine made by the [[Longines]] company was used, which was touted as the most accurate portable timer available. Probably realizing that seeing the same stunt a few times in a row was a bit boring, they moved the Super Bonus right after the $200 clock and before the jackpot clock on March 17, dropping the Longines timer.\n\nPartway through the run of the second Super Bonus, a rolling desk/table with dollar value of the bonus printed on it was used to roll out the props for the stunt. This carried over to the Big Cash Bonus Stunt. It is notable that in the earliest surviving episodes from 1952 that air, the original bonus had a similar desk with the value of the bonus on it. The desk was done away with for several years until the idea was reused in 1956.\n\n====Big Cash Bonus Stunt====\nStarting on September 22, 1956, the bonus reverted to the original Bonus Stunt format (attempted once per episode by whatever couple heard the \"bonus bell\" ringing). The Jackpot started at $5,000 and increased $1,000 every week it was not won. If successful, the couple left the show with the top prize. Otherwise, they continued on with the regular game.\n\n====Bonus Cash and Prize Stunt====\nFeatured on the daytime version. A lucky couple had a chance to win a bundle of cash and their choice of a new car or boat. To win, they had to successfully complete their Bonus Stunt. Like the original Bonus Stunt, the cash value started at $100, going up each time the stunt was not successfully completed. The largest cash bonus won on the daytime edition was $20,100 during its years on ABC.\n\n===Stunts===\nThe stunts performed on the show were mostly created by staff stunt writers Frank Wayne and Bob Howard. In the early days of the show, playwright [[Neil Simon]] was also a stunt writer. The stunts were usually aimed towards fun with difficulty being secondary. The stunts would usually be constructed out of common household props such as cardboard boxes, string, balloons, record players, dishes, cups, plates, cutlery, and balls of almost every type. As was the case with many other game shows during television's infancy, the budget was low.\n\nThe stunts performed varied widely, but there were some common themes. Most stunts in some way involved physical speed or dexterity. Contestants often had to balance something with some part of their body, or race back and forth on the stage (for example, releasing a balloon, running across the stage to do some task, and running back in time to catch the balloon before it floated too high). Often the challenge was some form of [[target practice]], in terms of throwing, rolling, bowling, etc.\n\nThe setup for the stunt was often designed to look easy but then have a complication or [[gimmick]] revealed. For example, Collyer would say \"All you have to do is stack four plates\", check the clock to see how much time they had to do it, and then add \"Oh, and one more thing...you can't use your hands\". Common twists included blindfolding one or both contestants, or telling them they could not use their hands (or feet or any body part that would be obvious to use for whatever the task was).\n\nThe other common element in the stunts was to get one of the contestants messy in some way often involving whipped cream, pancake batter, and such (usually limited to the husband of the couple). While it was not a part of every stunt, and sometimes it didn't even happen in an episode, it was common enough that when a couple brought a child on, Collyer would often ask what they thought the parents might have to do and the child would often respond \"get whipped cream in their face\". Many times the wife would be shown a task, be blindfolded, and then her husband would be quietly brought out and unknown to her she would be covering him with some sort of mess. When the mess was not hidden from the wife, Collyer would often jokingly tell the husband (who usually had a short haircut) that they would put a bathing cap on his head \"to keep your long hair out of your eyes\" before revealing what form of mess he would be involved with. Occasionally Collyer himself would get caught in the mess accidentally.\n\nTechnicality in the rules was not a major issue on the show. The goal was usually to make sure the contestants had fun. Collyer would often stop the clock in the middle of a stunt if the contestant(s) was struggling so he advised them on a better way to do the stunt. Often if a condition of the stunt was \"don't use your hands,\" Collyer would ignore the first use of hands and just warn the contestant. If the time limit was nearly up on a task, he would often give them a few moments extra, or tell them if they started before the clock ran out and succeeded in that attempt, he would count it. Sometimes if a contestant had come close enough (for example, if they had to stack cups and saucers without the pile falling over, and the contestant knocked the pile over while putting the last cup on top), he would give them the stunt if they did not have time to do it again. If there was a problem with a prop breaking or running out of a supply, such as balloons, Collyer would simply give the stunt to the couple, citing it as the show's fault. Similarly, on the messy stunts, since the goal was just to mess up the husband, the time limit was often unimportant and the clock would be stopped when Bud felt the husband was messy enough.\n\n===Prizes===\nPrizes varied depending on the era of the show and the sponsor at the time. During Sylvania's tenure as sponsor (which began in March 1951), consolation prizes for losing the $100 clock were usually a Sylvania radio.\n* $100 clock prizes included Michael C. Fina silverware sets, a collection of four Knapp-Monarch small kitchen appliances, or a [[The Hoover Company|Hoover]] [[vacuum cleaner|upright]], among others.\n* $200 clock prizes included International-Harvester refrigerators, air conditioning units (usually in the summer), a [[Tappan (brand)|Tappan]] range/oven, a James dishwasher, [[Speed Queen]] washers and dryers (for some reason, they were only offered separately) and small Sylvania TVs. All of these prizes, except the Sylvania radio, were shown on \"art cards\" and not actually brought out on the show.\n* The Jackpot Prize during Sylvania's tenure was always a Sylvania [[television set]]. Sometimes a [[hi-fi]] stereo/phonograph (with \"famous surround sound\") was included with the television, and it was noted that the Jackpot Prize was \"worth more than $500\". A notable (and often pointed out) feature of Sylvania's TVs at the time was the \"halo light\", which was an illuminated \"frame\" around the image which was supposed to have made watching the image easier on the eyes, similar to [[Philips]]' \"AmbiLight\" feature on television sets today.\n\nThe sets, as was the style at the time, were freestanding pieces of furniture that sat on legs on the floor with a speaker mounted below the screen. Various models were given away over the years\u2014sometimes the same model several times in one episode, sometimes a different model each time the Jackpot was won in an episode. Roxanne (later Beverly) would pose with the TV which was revealed from behind a curtain in a small faux living room.\n\nThere were also various gifts given to the contestants just for appearing on the show. There was a Sylvania ''Beat the Clock'' home game produced which was given to contestants starting in the mid-50s. When it was novel, Collyer would open the box and explain that it would be fun for not just children but adults at parties, and he would point out the working clock and the instructions for stunts and all the props. Later in the run it would be brought out, shown and whisked away just as quickly. The boxes were reworked a few times, and there was a new edition released later in the run. Both versions were manufactured by Lowell Toy Mfg. Co. of New York, who produced a number of television-based home games at the time.\n\nWhen children were brought on the show, there were special gifts. Starting on September 6, 1952, girls brought on the show were given a Roxanne doll that was produced at the time. On October 11, 1952, the [[Buck Rogers]] Space Ranger Kit was debuted for boys. In the mid-50s, each child was given a camera kit.\n\nIf contestants were involved in a messy stunt, Roxanne (later Beverly) would come out and take a picture. Initially it wasn't made clear how the couple would get the photo (perhaps mailed to them), but later in the run, the camera would be given to the couple in addition to any their children might already have been given. Collyer would explain that when they developed the film, the first photo would be that of the husband/couple.\n\nFrom 1956 and for the rest of the show's run on CBS, the Jackpot Prizes usually consisted of a [[Magnavox]] Color TV, [[Fedders]] air conditioners (usually awarded as a pair), [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation (1886)|Westinghouse]] washer & dryer pairs, and refrigerators, [[Hardwick (appliances)|Hardwick]] ranges, [[Whirpool Corporation|Whirlpool]] freezers, and Easy \"Combomatic\" combination washer-dryers.\n\n==1969\u20131974==\nOn September 15, 1969, ''Beat the Clock'' returned to television in five-day-a-week syndication. This series continued to air until September 20, 1974. For the first season (1969\u20131970), the show was taped at [[Helen Hayes Theatre|The Little Theatre]] on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in New York City, sharing the stage with [[The Merv Griffin Show]] and [[The David Frost Show]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eyesofageneration.com/the-little-theater-240-west-44th-street-in-midtown-manhattannow-known-as-th/?post_id=31118&comments=2&get=30&order=DESC|title=The Little Theater: 240 West 44th Street in Midtown Manhattan \u2013 Eyes Of A Generation\u2026Television's Living History}}</ref> After that, taping moved to [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] as a cost-saving measure. This was the only time Goodson-Todman taped a series in Canada that was not for a Canadian-specific audience. The show was broadcast by [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] in Canada.\n\n[[Jack Narz]] hosted the first three seasons of the series before leaving and his announcer, [[Gene Wood]], replaced him for the remainder of the run.\n\nThe music for this version of ''Beat the Clock'' was played live on the organ by keyboardist and arranger [[Dick Hyman]].\n\n===Jack Narz (1969\u20131972)===\nIn early episodes, couples, now aided by a weekly celebrity guest, played for points simply by completing stunts. The first couple to reach 100 points won a prize package. This was subsequently changed to the couples receiving a prize every time they won, which was later replaced by the winning couple facing a \"cash board\" with \"BEAT THE CLOCK\" spelled out on three levels, each letter concealing a money amount: either $25 (4), $50 (5), $100 (2), or $200. The couple would agree on a letter, select it, and the winnings would be revealed.\n\nIn addition, if a couple completed a stunt in less than half the time, the remaining time would be used for awarding a cash bonus. Anywhere from $10 to $50 would be awarded for each time the stunt was completed in the time remaining.\n\nAt some point during the show, the celebrity would perform a \"Solo Stunt\" (which seemed to have supplanted the Bonus Stunt on the original show). The couples won $50 if they guessed correctly whether the star could beat the clock or vice versa. Towards the end of Narz' tenure as host, stunts would be replaced in the second half of the show with the celebrity playing a game of intuition with the couples, who would play for a cash prize that was divided among them.\n\nDuring this time, the show was syndicated through [[20th Century Fox Television]].  One curious aspect of this version of the show was that Narz' suit jackets sported an embroidered patch of the show's ''Beat The Clock'' logo sewn onto the left breast.  This practice was similar to hosts [[Jim Lange]] and [[Bob Eubanks]]' wearing logo patches from ''[[The Dating Game]]'' and ''[[The Newlywed Game]]'' respectively, and also the scrambled \"mystery logo\" seen on Hugh Downs' (and later Bob Clayton's) blazer when they hosted [[Concentration (game show)|Concentration]].\n\n===Gene Wood (1972\u20131974)===\nJack Narz left the show in 1972. At the time, he made no announcement and gave no reason for his departure. In a 2007 [[Internet radio]] interview, Narz finally explained that the show's budget did not include his personal travel expenses. Narz had to pay for his travel, and the cost of airline fare between his Los Angeles home and Montreal became prohibitive. His travel costs were essentially equal to his earnings, and even a successful appeal to Mark Goodson for more money was not enough.\n\nAnnouncer Gene Wood hosted the show for the next two seasons. Wood had also been hosting a similar stunt game titled ''[[Anything You Can Do (game show)|Anything You Can Do]]'', a battle of the sexes competition which was also recorded in Canada. [[CFCF-TV]] Montreal staff announcer Nick Holenreich became the show's announcer (he had previously announced for a week during Narz's final season in which Wood was the celebrity guest). At this time, the show also changed syndicators to Firestone Syndication Services, which syndicated another Goodson-Todman show, ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'', which had originally been hosted by Bud Collyer.\n\nThe show was now called ''The New Beat the Clock'' (although the logo still read simply \"Beat the Clock\"), and the set was refreshed with a new color scheme and a redesigned clock. Like his predecessor, Wood also wore suit jackets with the show's logo sewn on the pockets.\n\nThe only changes in the format were that couples were introduced separately and played two stunts, win or lose (a win still getting a trip to the Cash Board), and both couples competed simultaneously in a final stunt, with the winning couple receiving a prize. Celebrity guests were retained in the new format, once again aiding the contestants, and performing the Solo Stunt as well as \"co-judge\" with Wood in the final stunt of the day. Another throwback to the Collyer era (when the show was seen in the daytime) was the revival of \"Ladies' Day\", where women only (not counting the celebrity for that week) would play the game.\n\nDespite continued popularity on local stations in both daytime and [[Prime Time Access Rule|prime time access]] timeslots, Goodson-Todman decided to discontinue production of ''Beat the Clock'' in 1974 when CTV asked the company for half of the proceeds from advertisers awarding their wares as contestant consolation prizes. Wood returned to voice-over work, and went on to a 20-year career announcing [[Los Angeles]]-based shows for Goodson-Todman and occasionally other packagers.\n\n===Episode status===\nSome episodes of this series are intact and have aired on [[Game Show Network|GSN]]. Two episodes from the Narz era were aired in late 2005 to pay tribute to [[Bob Denver]] and [[Louis Nye]], both of whom had recently died. An episode featuring [[Tom Kennedy (television presenter)|Tom Kennedy]] (Narz's brother) aired on June 11, 2007.\n\nIn January 2007, a Gene Wood episode aired which featured [[William Shatner]]. Another episode aired on October 22, 2007, featuring [[Dick Clark]]. At least three episodes were also aired featuring [[Richard Dawson]].\n\n==1979\u20131980==\nIn 1979, CBS elected to bring the series back as ''All-New Beat the Clock'' for its daytime schedule. Production moved to [[CBS Television City]], taping in Studio 31 and marking the only time a ''Beat the Clock'' series originated from Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shows\u2013CBS Television City|url=http://www.cbstelevisioncity.com/shows#|accessdate=July 25, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713152856/http://www.cbstelevisioncity.com/shows|archivedate=July 13, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The series premiered on September 17, 1979, at 10:00{{nbsp}}a.m., replacing reruns of ''[[All in the Family]]'' in the time period, preceding ''[[Whew!]]''. [[Monty Hall]], who had not hosted a game show [[Stefan Hatos-Monty Hall Productions|his company]] did not produce since he was host of Heatter-Quigley's ''[[Video Village]]'', was the emcee for the series while former host of the 1970s syndicated series, Jack Narz, served as his announcer and a series producer. The show faced competition from NBC's ''[[Card Sharks]]'' (ABC did not start programming until 11:00{{nbsp}}a.m.)\n\nThere were two theme songs used (both composed by [[Score Productions]]). The second one was performed live in the studio by a small band led by [[Arthur B. Rubinstein]].\n\nTwo couples, one usually a returning champion, competed against each other and the clock. The champion couple (or champion-designate if the previous episode had ended with a retiring champion couple) wore red sweaters while the opposing couple wore green.\n\n===Rounds 1 and 2===\nThe first two rounds began with the couples competing against each other in a stunt worth $500 for the winner. One stunt usually featured the women of the couples, while the other featured the men, though the other partner sometimes had to help as well. The stunts were conducted for 60 seconds and were either races against the clock to perform an objective or competitions to outscore the opponent in the stunt before the clock ran out. In the former case, the clock was run as a fail safe, and if neither couple managed to complete the stunt, the team furthest along won.\n\nHall would then bring the winning couple across the stage to compete in a stunt by themselves for an additional $500. After Hall described the stunt and what both partners had to do, the clock was set and the couple had to complete the stunt in the allotted time. Doing so won the $500, but failure to do so did not.\n\n===Bonus Shuffle===\nAfter the first two rounds, both teams squared off in a modified [[table shuffleboard]] game called the \"Bonus Shuffle\".\n\nThe teams took turns throwing pucks down the shuffleboard table. The team leading had the advantage of throwing three pucks and going first. If there was a tie, a coin was tossed with the winners going first and there were only two pucks per side. The table had eight stripes on it, and each stripe had a higher dollar amount on it. The first stripe was worth $300 and each subsequent stripe was worth $100 more, with the stripe at the very end of the table worth $1,000. There was just enough space in between the stripes where a puck could land and not score any money. Pucks had to remain on the table to count, and if a puck failed to reach the first stripe it was taken off the board and discarded. The teams were allowed to try to knock each other's pucks off the board if they so desired but did so at their own risk, as they could just as easily knock their own puck off the board or push a puck up the board and onto a higher value.\n\nThe team whose puck was furthest along on the board after all pucks had been thrown won the money attached to the space their puck was touching and became the day's champions. They then moved on to play the Bonus Stunt for ten times the amount of their Bonus Shuffle total. In the event of a tie, each team threw one puck. The first puck's landing spot was marked and the other team had to beat the mark to win.\n\n===Bonus Stunt===\nThe Bonus Stunt round was conducted the same way as the solo stunts were. Hall would give the objective of the Bonus Stunt to the champion couple, then the clock would be set and the couple had to complete the stunt before time ran out. If they did so, as previously mentioned, they won ten times their Bonus Shuffle score for a maximum of $10,000 and a new Bonus Stunt would be played on the next show. If a Bonus Stunt was played five consecutive times without a couple managing to complete it, the stunt would be replaced with a new one.\n\nCouples continued to appear until they were either defeated or surpassed $25,000 in total winnings. A team could win up to $13,000 in one day if they managed to win all four stunts in the main game, score $1,000 in the Bonus Shuffle, and win the Bonus Stunt.\n\n===''The All-New All-Star Beat The Clock''===\nOn November 5, 1979, the show switched to an all-celebrity format. The changes that were made included:\n* Celebrity pairs played for designated rooting sections of the audience which split the winnings. (Also, someone in \"the winning rooting section\" won a set of prizes, which were the \"consolation prizes\" in the non-celebrity part of the run.)\n* Both rooting sections could be seen on-camera.\n* Stunts in the first two rounds were only worth $250 for the rooting sections.\n* If the winning team completed the bonus stunt, $1,000 went to their rooting section while the remaining money went to their favorite charity (thus, the most money a celebrity team could win for their rooting section in a single day was $3,000 and a possible $9,000 to their charity).\n* Both star teams remained on the show for a week. The pairings stayed the same on four of the five days, with the teams changing colors (the red team on Monday and Thursday was the green team on Tuesday and Friday). On Wednesdays, the teams switched, although still one man and one woman per team.\n* In case of a tie going into the Bonus Shuffle, a coin toss determined who went first.\n* In the last two weeks of the run, after each head-to-head stunt, both teams got to perform the next stunt, with the losing team from the previous stunt going first. If both teams performed this stunt within the time limit, whoever did it faster got the $250.\n* The theme song was now an upbeat version of the first one used in its run (it was previously used going into and out of the commercials of the earlier episodes), and was performed live in the studio.\n\n===Episode status===\nThis series exists in its entirety. The Christmas episode with [[Ronnie Schell]], [[Joyce Bulifant]], [[Johnny Brown (actor)|Johnny Brown]], and [[Patti Deutsch]] has aired on GSN in the past during Christmas-themed marathons. The series aired on GSN between September 10, 2007, and September 2008 in a late Saturday and Sunday night slot but was pulled from the schedule after beginning the final week. On November 12, 2008, it returned to the GSN lineup weeknights at 2:00{{nbsp}}a.m., replacing ''[[Trivia Trap]]''. It last aired January 3, 2009.\n\n[[Buzzr]] has also carried the Hall version of ''Beat the Clock'' on a sporadic basis.\n\n==2002\u20132003==\nThis version, the show's previous appearance other than the ''[[Gameshow Marathon (U.S. TV series)|Gameshow Marathon]]'' special, aired daily from September 2, 2002, to September 4, 2003, on [[PAX TV]] (the first week of shows was called a \"preview week\"). Taped in [[Universal Studios Florida]], three couples competed in this version with no returning champions. The couples were distinguished by color\u2014red, blue, and gold.\n\n===Round 1===\nTo start the game, all three couples faced off in a stunt. The first couple to complete the stunt got 10 points and the advantage of having to play a 30-second solo stunt first, as well as the ability to assign the stunts to the other teams- prior to gameplay the couple was shown 3 items on a tray that represented the stunts themselves, picked one for themselves to play, and divided the other two among the remaining players.\n\nBefore the playing of each stunt, a two-part trivia question was asked. Answering it correctly gave the team 10 extra seconds to complete the stunt and both parts had to be answered correctly, one by each player, in order to get those 10 seconds. 10 points were given for completing the stunt with one additional point for each second remaining on the clock (for example, if a couple completed a stunt with three seconds remaining, they scored 13 points for the round).\n\n===Round 2===\nThe second round consisted of two parts. The first part was another face-off stunt, i.e. trying to throw a ring around a pole the other player is wearing on their head. In a stunt like this, the first place couple's ring tosser would be closest to their partner, the second place couple would be slightly further back, and the third place couple would be the furthest back (the first place couple was always given an advantage, with the second having less of one and the third the least). Play continued until two of the couples completed the stunt, with those two teams continuing on.\n\nThe two remaining couples were then shown the stunt they would have to attempt. After the stunt was described, another trivia question was asked. In this case, the female half of the couple was given the option to answer it, have her partner answer it, or pass it to the other team to make them answer. If the couple answered correctly they would be given control, but if they did not the opponents did. The two couples then bid down from a base time of two minutes to see who could complete the stunt in the fastest amount of time, and bidding continued until one team challenged the other to beat the clock. The stunt was then played, and if the challenged couple completed it they won the game and advanced to the bonus game. If they were not successful, the challenging couple won the game.\n\n===Bonus Round (\"The Swirling Whirlwind of Cash and Prizes\")===\nThe winning couple played the \"Swirling Whirlwind of Cash and Prizes\", which took place inside a machine similar to a [[vertical wind tunnel]]. $25,000 in cash was inside the machine, as well as several \"prize vouchers\" (coloured slips of paper with the names of prizes written on them). Several more vouchers would be tossed into the machine prior to the start of the round.\n\nOnce inside the machine, both players tried to grab as much money and prize vouchers as they could within a 1-minute time limit. There were three standing rules- both players could grab items but they had to be placed in a bag worn around the male partner's waist, they couldn't bend over and pick up anything off the floor (although they could kick items off the floor into the air), and once the buzzer sounded, they had to put their hands up and stop. Later in the run, several [[gold certificate]]s were added to the machine and if the couple picked one up, the cash they had grabbed would be doubled. (If the couple somehow picked up more than one, only one was counted.)\n\nThe \"swirling whirlwind\" was previously used in the bonus round of ''[[The Diamond Head Game]]'', a show hosted by [[Bob Eubanks]] in 1975.\n\n== 2018 ==\nOn October 12, 2017, [[Universal Kids]] announced that it had ordered a revival of ''Beat the Clock'' from FremantleMedia North America, which premiered on February 6, 2018. The new version, (taped in Los Angeles, making it the second version taped there) features children and adults competing as teams and was hosted by Paul Costabile.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/programming/fremantlemedia-na-sells-two-game-shows-universal-kids/169285|title=FremantleMedia N.A.

There are three rounds of stunts. \n\nThe first round is worth $100/stunt and the second round is worth $150/stunt. The third and final round is a head-to-head challenge for $300 for a possible grand total of $550. Both teams get to keep the cash, but the team with the most money at the end of round three wins the game and goes on to try and Beat The Big Clock for over $2,000 if the losing team not win any money than they got consolation prize .  In the event of a tie, whoever completes the task first, or does the most tasks within the time limit in the head to head wins.  If neither teams complete the challenge and are still tied, whoever has the most money wins.\n\n===The Big Clock===\nThe winning team has 60 seconds to complete one final four-part stunt. Each part completed is worth $250, and completing all four parts wins the team $2,000, along with a $1,000 donation to a children's charity of the team's choice because paul always says that because they spread the love \nhere if not than the money they won earlier plus $250 they won from the stunts they did complete the donation Is not given to anyone who loses\n\n==International versions==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:98%;\"\n|-\n!

In 1537, they established the city of [[Asunci\u00f3n]],<ref>\"Paraguay: c\u00f3mo Asunci\u00f3n se convirti\u00f3 en \"madre\" de m\u00e1s de 70 ciudades de Sudam\u00e9rica hace 480 a\u00f1os\".

Paraguay was the center of the [[Reductions|Jesuit Missions]], where the [[Guaran\u00ed people]] were educated and introduced to [[Christianity]] and European culture under the direction of the [[Society of Jesus]] in [[Jesuit reduction]]s, mainly during the 17th century.<ref>Caraman, Philip (1976): \"The lost paradise: the Jesuit Republic in South America\", New York: Seabury Press.</ref> However, after the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|expulsion of the Jesuits]] from Spanish territories in 1767, Paraguay increasingly became a peripheral colony, with few urban centers and settlers. Following [[Independence of Paraguay|independence from Spain]] at the beginning of the 19th century, Paraguay was ruled by a series of [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] governments who generally implemented [[nationalist]], [[isolationism|isolationist]] and [[protectionism|protectionist]] policies. This period ended with the disastrous [[Paraguayan War]], during which Paraguay lost at least 50% of its prewar population and around 25\u201333% of its territory to the [[Treaty of the Triple Alliance|Triple Alliance]] of [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]] and [[Uruguay]]. In the 20th century, Paraguay faced another major international conflict \u2013 the [[Chaco War]] \u2013 against Bolivia, from which the Paraguayans emerged victorious. Afterwards, the country entered a period of military dictatorships, ending with the 35 year regime of [[Alfredo Stroessner]] that lasted until he was toppled in 1989 by an internal military coup. This marked the beginning of the \"democratic era\" of Paraguay.\n\nWith around seven million inhabitants, Paraguay is a founding member of [[Mercosur]], an original member of the [[United Nations]], the [[Organization of American States]], the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and the [[Lima Group]]. Also, the city of [[Luque]], in Asuncion's Metropolitan Area, is the seat of the [[CONMEBOL]].

One of the most common explanations is that it means \"water of the [[Payagua]] (a native tribe)\". Another meaning links the [[Guarani language|Guarani]] words ''para'' (\"river\") and ''guai'' (\"crown\"), meaning \"crowned river\". A third meaning may be ''para'' (\"river\"), ''gua'' (\"from\"), ''y'' (\"water\") meaning \"water that comes from the river\", referring to the bog in the north of the country, which is actually in Brazil.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Paraguay}}\n\n=== Pre-Columbian era ===\nThe [[indigenous people|indigenous]] [[Guaran\u00ed people|Guaran\u00ed]] had been living in eastern Paraguay for at least a millennium before the arrival of the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]]. Western Paraguay, the [[Gran Chaco]], was inhabited by nomads of whom the [[Guaycuru]] peoples were the most prominent. The Paraguay River was roughly the dividing line between the agricultural Guarani people to the east and the nomadic and semi-nomadic people to the west in the Gran Chaco. The Guarcuru nomads were known for their warrior traditions and were not fully pacified until the late 19th century. These indigenous tribes belonged to five distinct language families, which were the bases of their major divisions. Differing language speaking groups were generally competitive over resources and territories. They were further divided into tribes by speaking languages in branches of these families. Today 17 separate [[Ethnolinguistics|ethnolinguistic]] groups remain.\n\n=== Colonization ===\nThe first Europeans in the area were Spanish explorers in 1516.<ref name=eec>Sacks, Richard S. \"Early explorers and conquistadors\".

They developed [[Jesuit reduction]]s to bring Guarani populations together at Spanish missions and protect them from virtual slavery by Spanish settlers and Portuguese slave raiders, the [[Bandeirantes]], in addition to seeking their conversion to Christianity. Catholicism in Paraguay was influenced by the indigenous peoples; the [[syncretic]] religion has absorbed native elements. The ''reducciones'' flourished in eastern Paraguay for about 150 years, until the expulsion of the Jesuits by the Spanish Crown in 1767. The ruins of two 18th-century [[Jesuit Missions of La Sant\u00edsima Trinidad de Paran\u00e1 and Jes\u00fas de Tavarangue]] have been designated as [[World Heritage Sites]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref name=\"cite wdl|#2581\"/>\n\nIn western Paraguay, Spanish settlement and Christianity were strongly resisted by the nomadic [[Guaycuru peoples|Guaycuru]] and other nomads from the 16th century onward.

One of Cubas' first acts after taking office in August was to commute Oviedo's sentence and release him. In December 1998, Paraguay's Supreme Court declared these actions unconstitutional. In this tense atmosphere, the murder of Vice President and long-time Oviedo rival [[Luis Mar\u00eda Arga\u00f1a]] on 23 March 1999, led the Chamber of Deputies to impeach Cubas the next day.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} On 26 March, eight student anti-government demonstrators were murdered, widely believed to have been carried out by Oviedo supporters.

The eastern region (Regi\u00f3n Oriental); and the western region, officially called Western Paraguay (Regi\u00f3n Occidental) and also known as the Chaco, which is part of the [[Gran Chaco]]. The country lies between latitudes [[19th parallel south|19\u00b0]] and [[28th parallel south|28\u00b0S]], and longitudes [[54th meridian west|54\u00b0]] and [[63rd meridian west|63\u00b0W]].\nThe terrain consists mostly of grassy plains and wooded hills in the eastern region. To the west are mostly low, marshy plains.\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{Main|Climate of Paraguay}}\nThe overall climate is [[tropical climate|tropical]] to [[subtropical climate|subtropical]]. Like most lands in the region, Paraguay has only wet and dry periods. Winds play a major role in influencing Paraguay's weather: between October and March, warm winds blow from the Amazon Basin in the north, while the period between May and August brings cold winds from the Andes.\n\nThe absence of mountain ranges to provide a natural barrier allows winds to develop speeds as high as {{convert|161|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. This also leads to significant changes in temperature within a short span of time; between April and September, temperatures will sometimes drop below freezing. January is the hottest summer month, with an average daily temperature of 28.9 degrees Celsius (84 degrees F).\n\nRainfall varies dramatically across the country, with substantial rainfall in the eastern portions, and semi-arid conditions in the far west. The far eastern forest belt receives an average of {{convert|170|cm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}} of rain annually, while the western Chaco region typically averages no more than {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} a year. The rains in the west tend to be irregular and evaporate quickly, contributing to the aridity of the area.\n\n==Government and politics==\n{{Main|Politics of Paraguay |Human rights in Paraguay|Foreign relations of Paraguay}}\nParaguay is a [[representative democratic]] republic, with a multi-party system and [[separation of powers]] in three branches. Executive power is exercised solely by the [[President of Paraguay|President]], who is [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. [[Legislative power]] is vested in the two chambers of the [[Congress of Paraguay|National Congress]]. The [[Judicial Branch|judiciary]] is vested on [[tribunals]] and Courts of [[Civil Law (legal system)|Civil Law]] and a nine-member Supreme Court of Justice, all of them independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\n===Military===\n{{main|Military of Paraguay}}\n[[File:Paraguayan marines at Ancon Marine Base 2010-07-19.JPG|thumb|Paraguayan marines at Ancon Marine Base]]\nThe [[military of Paraguay]] consist of the Paraguayan [[army]], [[navy]] (including [[naval aviation]] and [[marine corps]]) and [[air force]].\n\nThe [[constitution of Paraguay]] (article 238) establishes the [[president of Paraguay]] as the [[commander-in-chief]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Constitution of 1992|url=http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Paraguay/|accessdate=18 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nParaguay has [[Conscription|compulsory military service]], and all 18-year-old males and 17-year-olds in the year of their 18th birthday are liable for one year of [[active duty]].

Guaran\u00ed claims its place as one of the last surviving and thriving of South American indigenous national languages. In 2015, Spanish was spoken by about 87% of the population, while Guaran\u00ed is spoken by more than 90%, or slightly more than 5.8 million speakers. 52% of rural Paraguayans are bilingual in Guaran\u00ed.

Their culture is highly influenced by various European countries, including Spain. Therefore, Paraguayan culture is a fusion of two cultures and traditions; one European, the other, Southern Guaran\u00ed. More than 93% of Paraguayans are ''[[mestizos]]'', making Paraguay one of the most homogeneous countries in Latin America. A characteristic of this cultural fusion is the extensive bilingualism present to this day: more than 80% of Paraguayans speak both [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and the indigenous language, [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]]. [[Jopara]], a mixture of Guaran\u00ed and Spanish, is also widely spoken.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n[[File:Ovecha Ragu\u00e9 Festival Paraguay.jpg|thumb|Ovecha Ragu\u00e9 Festival]]\nThis cultural fusion is expressed in arts such as embroidery (''ao po'\u00ed'') and [[Nanduti|lace making]] (''\u00f1andut\u00ed''). The [[music of Paraguay]], which consists of lilting polkas, bouncy ''galopas,'' and languid ''[[Guarania (music)|guaranias]]'' is played on the native harp. Paraguay's culinary heritage is also deeply influenced by this cultural fusion. Several popular dishes contain [[manioc]], a local staple crop similar to the [[Cassava|yuca]] also known as Cassava root found in the [[Southwestern United States]] and [[Mexico]], as well as other indigenous ingredients. A popular dish is ''[[sopa paraguaya]]'', similar to a thick [[corn bread]]. Another notable food is ''[[chipa]]'', a [[bagel]]-like bread made from [[cornmeal]], manioc, and cheese. Many other dishes consist of different kinds of cheeses, onions, bell peppers, cottage cheese, cornmeal, milk, seasonings, butter, eggs and fresh corn kernels.\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s were the time of the birth of a new generation of Paraguayan novelists and poets such as [[Jos\u00e9 Ricardo Maz\u00f3]], [[Roque Vallejos]], and Nobel Prize nominee [[Augusto Roa Bastos]]. Several [[Cinema of Paraguay|Paraguayan films]] have been made.\n\nInside the family, conservative values predominate. In lower classes, [[godparent]]s have a special relationship to the family, since usually, they are chosen because of their favorable social position, in order to provide extra security for the children. Particular respect is owed them, in return for which the family can expect protection and patronage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/paraguay/29.htm|title=Paraguay \u2013 Ritual Kinship|website=countrystudies.us|access-date=30 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Sports===\n{{Main|Sport in Paraguay}}\nSport in Paraguay is an important part of the country's national culture.

The word latissimus dorsi (plural: ''latissimi dorsi'') comes from [[Latin]] and means \"broadest [muscle] of the back\", from \"latissimus\" ({{lang-la|broadest}})' and \"dorsum\" ({{lang-la|back}}). The pair of muscles are commonly known as \"lats\", especially among [[bodybuilder]]s. The latissimus dorsi is the largest muscle in the upper body.\n\nThe latissimus dorsi is responsible for [[Extension (kinesiology)|extension]], [[adduction]], transverse extension also known as horizontal abduction, flexion from an extended position, and (medial) [[internal rotation]] of the [[shoulder joint]]. It also has a [[synergistic]] role in extension and lateral flexion of the lumbar spine.\n\nDue to bypassing the scapulothoracic joints and attaching directly to the spine, the actions the latissimi dorsi have on moving the arms can also influence the movement of the scapulae, such as their downward rotation during a [[pull up (exercise)|pull up]].\n\n==Structure==\n\n===Variations===\n{{multiple image|perrow = 1|image1 = Braus 1921 137.png|300|image2 = Grant 1962 27c.png|300|footer = Axillary arches shown from two different angles.}}\nThe number of dorsal vertebrae to which it is attached varies from four to eight; the number of costal attachments varies; muscle fibers may or may not reach the crest of the ilium.\n\nA muscular slip, the [[Axillary Arch|axillary arch]], varying from 7 to 10&nbsp;cm in length, and from 5 to 15&nbsp;mm in breadth, occasionally springs from the upper edge of the latissimus dorsi about the middle of the posterior fold of the axilla, and crosses the axilla in front of the axillary vessels and nerves, to join the under surface of the tendon of the [[pectoralis major]], the [[coracobrachialis]], or the fascia over the [[biceps brachii]].

The word latissimus dorsi (plural: ''latissimi dorsi'') comes from [[Latin]] and means \"broadest [muscle] of the back\", from \"latissimus\" ({{lang-la|broadest}})' and \"dorsum\" ({{lang-la|back}}). The pair of muscles are commonly known as \"lats\", especially among [[bodybuilder]]s. The latissimus dorsi is the largest muscle in the upper body.\n\nThe latissimus dorsi is responsible for [[Extension (kinesiology)|extension]], [[adduction]], transverse extension also known as horizontal abduction, flexion from an extended position, and (medial) [[internal rotation]] of the [[shoulder joint]]. It also has a [[synergistic]] role in extension and lateral flexion of the lumbar spine.\n\nDue to bypassing the scapulothoracic joints and attaching directly to the spine, the actions the latissimi dorsi have on moving the arms can also influence the movement of the scapulae, such as their downward rotation during a [[pull up (exercise)|pull up]].\n\n==Structure==\n\n===Variations===\n{{multiple image|perrow = 1|image1 = Braus 1921 137.png|300|image2 = Grant 1962 27c.png|300|footer = Axillary arches shown from two different angles.}}\nThe number of dorsal vertebrae to which it is attached varies from four to eight; the number of costal attachments varies; muscle fibers may or may not reach the crest of the ilium.\n\nA muscular slip, the [[Axillary Arch|axillary arch]], varying from 7 to 10&nbsp;cm in length, and from 5 to 15&nbsp;mm in breadth, occasionally springs from the upper edge of the latissimus dorsi about the middle of the posterior fold of the axilla, and crosses the axilla in front of the axillary vessels and nerves, to join the under surface of the tendon of the [[pectoralis major]], the [[coracobrachialis]], or the fascia over the [[biceps brachii]].

A [[tornado emergency]] was issued following real-time confirmation of a large tornado just west of Monroe. The tornado missed downtown Monroe by about a mile, but nonetheless inflicted roof damage to many homes. A metal building structure was damaged while a wooden power pole and steel street light assembly were snapped. The most intense damage was associated with a mesovortex that ripped the roofs off three homes, including home with most of its exterior walls collapsed. At [[Monroe Regional Airport (Louisiana)|Monroe Regional Airport]], a hangar was demolished and several planes were damaged before the tornado lifted. Damage to the airport is estimated at $25\u201330&nbsp;million.

After an EF2 tornado lifted far south-west of Bassfield, another intensified, as it approached the town and a tornado emergency was issued, the first of many across the area. Here major damage was reported as an intense velocity couplet developed on radar and debris was shown to be lofted {{convert|20,000|ft|km|abbr=on}} high, with a photo being carried 121 miles downstream into [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]]. The tornado continued into [[Seminary, Mississippi|Seminary]], [[Soso, Mississippi|Soso]], and [[Heidelberg, Mississippi|Heidelberg]] where tornado emergencies were issued as well, and major damage was reported and homes were levelled, including one that had its plumbing fixtures ripped out, indicative of very intense winds. The [[SPC]] issued a mesoscale discussion stating that a tornado with winds of 170-205 mph was likely ongoing, and that it was an 'exceptionally rare event'. This tornado had a maximum width of at least 2 miles,making it the widest in Mississippi history and the 3rd widest in US history,a path length of 68 miles and received a preliminary rating of EF4 with winds of 190mph.\n===Salem - Bassfield=== \nThe second supercell then developed another violent tornado, this time developing in [[Walthall County]]. The tornado quickly strengthened to an EF2, where it snapped numerous trees and grew in width. The tornado then reached EF4 strength as it approached James Ratcliffe rd. where 2 frame homes where leveled, one reduced to a slab, and a large tree was uprooted and tossed several metres. Here debris was also lofted {{convert|20,000|ft|km|abbr=on}} high. The tornado then followed a similar path to the first tornado north of Bassfield, close to [[Collins, Mississippi|Collins]], and northeast toward [[Enterprise, Clarke County, Mississippi|Enterprise]] where tornado emergencies were issued. This tornado ha a path length of 82.5 miles and a maximum width of 1 mile. The close paths of the tornadoes meant that some communities were encompassed in both tornado emergencies, a rare occurrence potentially not seen since 1999.\n<ref name=\"wapoupdates\">{{cite news |author=Matthew Cappucci |author2=Andrew Freeman |author3=Jason Samenow |title=13 Dead as Tornadoes, Storms Tear Through Southern States |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/04/13/tornado-severe-weather-east-coast/ |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=April 13, 2020 |accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref> At least twelve fatalities were confirmed, including four in [[Jefferson Davis County, Mississippi|Jefferson Davis County]], two each in [[Jones County, Mississippi|Jones]] and [[Lawrence County, Mississippi|Lawrence]] counties, and one each in [[Carroll County, Mississippi|Carroll]], [[Panola County, Mississippi|Panola]], and [[Walthall County, Mississippi|Walthall]] counties.<ref name=\"twcupdates\">{{cite web |author=Ron Brackett |author2=Jan Wesner Childs |title=Tornadoes, Severe Storms Tear Across the South, Killing 32 |url=https://weather.com/storms/tornado/news/2020-04-13-tornadoes-storms-impacts-south-carolina-georgia-mississippi-arkansas |publisher=The Weather Channel |date=April 13, 2020 |accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref> \n===Other notable tornadoes===\nAs the line of storms progressed east, another significant tornado affected Chattanooga, Tennessee, prompting yet another tornado emergency.<ref name=\"wapoupdates\" /> The tornado killed two people,<ref name=\"tn\" /> including one man who died when a tree fell onto his home; numerous other people were treated for injuries at local hospitals.<ref>{{cite web |title=1 killed, dozens injured, 150 homes & businesses damaged after tornado, powerful storms stuck Chattanooga |url=https://www.wbir.com/article/news/local/chattanooga-area-officials-several-people-taken-to-hospital-after-storms-one-missing/51-e60d1877-aeba-4100-8feb-b25b6f3584b8 |publisher=WBIR |date=April 13, 2020 |accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref> It has been rated EF3 intensity.<ref name=\"EastChatupdate\"/> A pre-dawn tornado in [[Murray County, Georgia]], killed seven people and injured at least 23 others as it hit a number of mobile homes.<ref name=\"auto\"/> A man in [[Cartersville, Georgia]], was also killed when a tree fell through his home.<ref>{{cite web |author=Marc Teichner |author2=Natalie Fultz |author3=Emilie Ikeda |author4=Colin Lawler |title=At least 6 dead, dozens injured after severe storms rip through Georgia overnight |url=https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/at-least-6-dead-dozens-injured-after-severe-storms-rip-through-georgia-overnight |publisher=Fox 5 Atlanta |date=April 13, 2020 |accessdate=April 13, 2020}}</ref> Numerous deadly tornadoes tracked across South Carolina, including one death associated with an EF3 tornado in [[Seneca, South Carolina|Seneca]], one death in [[Colleton County, South Carolina|Colleton County]], five deaths in [[Hampton County, South Carolina|Hampton County]]\u2014three of which were in Nixville\u2014and two deaths associated with an EF3 tornado in [[Livingston, South Carolina|Livingston]].<ref name=\"twcupdates\" />\n\n==Non-tornadic impacts==\nHeavy rainfall across eastern Texas led to flash flooding and multiple road closures throughout many communities.

After an EF2 tornado lifted far south-west of Bassfield, another intensified, as it approached the town and a tornado emergency was issued, the first of many across the area. Here major damage was reported as an intense velocity couplet developed on radar and debris was shown to be lofted {{convert|20,000|ft|km|abbr=on}} high, with a photo being carried 121 miles downstream into [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]]. The tornado continued into [[Seminary, Mississippi|Seminary]], [[Soso, Mississippi|Soso]], and [[Heidelberg, Mississippi|Heidelberg]] where tornado emergencies were issued as well, and major damage was reported and homes were levelled, including one that had its plumbing fixtures ripped out, indicative of very intense winds. The [[SPC]] issued a mesoscale discussion stating that a tornado with winds of 170-205 mph was likely ongoing, and that it was an 'exceptionally rare event'. This tornado had a maximum width of at least 2 miles,making it the widest in Mississippi history and the 3rd widest in US history,a path length of 68 miles and received a preliminary rating of EF4 with winds of 190mph.\n===Salem - Bassfield=== \nThe second supercell then developed another violent tornado, this time developing in [[Walthall County]]. The tornado quickly strengthened to an EF2, where it snapped numerous trees and grew in width. The tornado then reached EF4 strength as it approached James Ratcliffe rd. where 2 frame homes where leveled, one reduced to a slab, and a large tree was uprooted and tossed several metres. Here debris was also lofted {{convert|20,000|ft|km|abbr=on}} high. The tornado then followed a similar path to the first tornado north of Bassfield, close to [[Collins, Mississippi|Collins]], and northeast toward [[Enterprise, Clarke County, Mississippi|Enterprise]] where tornado emergencies were issued. This tornado ha a path length of 82.5 miles and a maximum width of 1 mile.

It was owned by Angus McKenzie who had purchased Larry Lyons's Olympia Studio in [[Fulham]]. McKenzie then took on a lease for a derelict synagogue situated at Carlton Street in London's West End.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philsbook.com/olympic.html|title=Philsbook, Olympic Studios|publisher=philsbook.com|accessdate=21 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024141208/http://www.philsbook.com/olympic.html|archive-date=24 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn conjunction with Richard \"Dick\" Swettenham, McKenzie opened Olympic's studio One with a [[vacuum tube|tube]] recording console from the Olympia Studio.<ref name=\"Keith Grant Interview\"/> Swettenham designed the first professional [[transistor]]ised desk in the world, which was installed into studio One during 1960, along with the first [[Multitrack recording|Four track]] tape recorder in England.<ref name=\"Keith Grant Interview\"/> The studio first came to prominence in 1958 when its senior sound engineer [[John Timperley (sound engineer)|John Timperley]] recorded music which was listed in the music magazine ''[[Melody Maker]]''{{'}}s top ten ratings. John Timperley's assistant was Roger Savage who quickly gained a reputation as a good sound balancer. In 1962 Terry Allen joined the company as an electronic engineer assisting Dick Swettenham with his new transistorised sound desk. Allen soon became studio manager and Timperley left the studios in late 1962 when Keith Grant was given the position of senior sound engineer. Another employee was Michael Ross-Trevor who eventually joined CBS Records at the start of a long career in classical music recording.\n\nStudio One was used by many influential groups including [[the Yardbirds]], [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]], [[Alexis Korner]], [[The Seekers]] and [[Graham Bond]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grahambond.org/discography.html|title=Graham Bond discography| publisher=grahambond.com|accessdate=21 October 2013}}</ref> The Rolling Stones<ref name=\"Olympic Studios, Scenta\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scenta.co.uk/music/cit/828718/the-very-best-of-british-recording-studios.htm|title=The very best of British recording studios|publisher=scenta.co.uk|accessdate=3 March 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822015513/http://www.engineeringuk.com/|archivedate=22 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> recorded their first single \"Come On\" at the studio, [[Dusty Springfield]] hits and [[the Troggs|Trogg]]'s single \"[[Wild Thing (Chip Taylor song)|Wild Thing]]\" were also recorded at Olympic during the 1960s.

Grant oversaw the development of the new studios bringing in his father Robertson Grant as an architect.<ref name=\"Keith Grant Interview\"/>  \n\nSituated at 117 Church Road, the Barnes building was constructed in 1906 and known as Byfeld Hall, a theatre for the Barnes Repertory Company. In its first decade it was a venue associated with the [[bioscope show|bioscope]], an early form of cinema combined with music hall and instrumentation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24639862|title=Olympic Studios Reborn|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=26 October 2008}}</ref> Between the 1930s and the post second world war era, it was a cinema. In the 1950s, the building became television production studios. Actors who played there included [[John Gielgud]] and [[Claude Rains]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympiccinema.co.uk/?page=8|title=Olympic Cinema \u2013 History|date= | publisher=Olympic Cinema|accessdate=17 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Barnes studios recording history ==\nApart from Roger Savage, several other young staff began their careers at Olympic. Among them was [[Gus Dudgeon]] who began as a tape operator and was later associated with [[Elton John]] and used Olympic Studios for sessions with John, as his producer. Engineer [[Eddie Kramer]] recalled that in 1967 \"Olympic Studios was at the cutting edge of technology. We were very innovative and of course we had [I think] the best console in England and possibly the world at the time\".<ref name=\"guitarworld\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/interview-engineer-eddie-kramer-recording-beatles-all-you-need-love|title=Engineer Eddie Kramer talks about the Beatles' All You Need Is Love|publisher=guitarworld|accessdate=21 October 2013}}</ref> \"We were ahead in terms of design.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov05/articles/classictracks.htm|title=Classic tracks :  Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Kramer|publisher=soundonsound.com|accessdate=8 January 2014}}</ref> The Rolling Stones were among the first clients of the new Olympic Studios in Barnes, consecutively recording six of their albums there between 1966 and 1972.<ref name=\"Olympic Studios Zani\" /> The Beatles worked at the studio to record the songs \"[[All You Need Is Love]]\" (1967),<ref name=\"guitarworld\"/> having been happy with their recording of the song \"[[Baby, You're a Rich Man]]\" (1967) on their first visit to Olympic. [[Jimi Hendrix]] recorded tracks for his album ''[[Are You Experienced]]'' (1967), the tracks for ''[[Axis: Bold as Love]]'' (1967) and a large part of ''[[Electric Ladyland]]'' (1968). [[The Who]] recorded their albums ''[[Who's Next]]'' and ''[[Who Are You]]'' there and it was used extensively by [[Led Zeppelin]], who recorded tracks there for all of their studio albums up to and including ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'' in 1975. In the same year [[Queen (band)|Queen]] used the studio for their album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and [[David Bowie]] used the studio at the same time. The studio also saw the production of other landmark albums and singles including tracks by [[Small Faces]], [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]], [[Blind Faith]], [[Hawkwind]], [[the Seekers]], [[the Moody Blues]], and [[Deep Purple]]. [[Procol Harum]] recorded all tracks for their album \"[[A Whiter Shade of Pale]]\" at Olympic.<ref name=\"Olympic by Nick Coleman\" />\n\nIn 1969, Grant commissioned his father to re-design studio Two as the now unexpectedly popular studio was causing problems with sound transmission to Studio One. Studio One, for example might be recording classical music by [[Elgar]] while Studio Two would be hosting sessions with the Rolling Stones. Robertson Grant successfully innovated a completely floating space weighing seventeen tons which was supported by rubber pads. The d\u00e9cor and furnishing of the new studio Two was designed by [[Mick Jagger]].<ref name=\"Keith Grant Interview\"/> Later on, Grant added probably the first instant acoustic change, using rough sawn wooden slats which could cover or reveal sound-absorbing panels behind them and change the acoustic sound. This made the room suitable for the recording of both rock and orchestral music at the pull of a cord.<ref name=\"Keith Grant Interview\"/>\n\nBy the turn of the 1970s, many orchestral works and film scores such as the original album version of the rock musical ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' were being recorded at Olympic. The studio produced film music for \u2013 among others \u2013 ''[[The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (film)|The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie]]'' (1968), ''[[The Italian Job]]'' (1969), the movie version of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar (film)|Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' (1973), ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' (recorded in studio Two in 1975 and ''[[Life of Brian]]'' (1979).\n\nOlympic's sound mixing desks were a creation of the maintenance staff and built specially for the studios.

recordings made during late 1960s onwards. It was a highly respected studio used by the music industry's rock and pop bands.

It was owned by Angus McKenzie who had purchased Larry Lyons's Olympia Studio in [[Fulham]]. McKenzie then took on a lease for a derelict synagogue situated at Carlton Street in London's West End.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philsbook.com/olympic.html|title=Philsbook, Olympic Studios|publisher=philsbook.com|accessdate=21 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024141208/http://www.philsbook.com/olympic.html|archive-date=24 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn conjunction with Richard \"Dick\" Swettenham, McKenzie opened Olympic's studio One with a [[vacuum tube|tube]] recording console from the Olympia Studio.<ref name=\"Keith Grant Interview\"/> Swettenham designed the first professional [[transistor]]ised desk in the world, which was installed into studio One during 1960, along with the first [[Multitrack recording|Four track]] tape recorder in England.<ref name=\"Keith Grant Interview\"/> The studio first came to prominence in 1958 when its senior sound engineer [[John Timperley (sound engineer)|John Timperley]] recorded music which was listed in the music magazine ''[[Melody Maker]]''{{'}}s top ten ratings. John Timperley's assistant was Roger Savage who quickly gained a reputation as a good sound balancer. In 1962 Terry Allen joined the company as an electronic engineer assisting Dick Swettenham with his new transistorised sound desk. Allen soon became studio manager and Timperley left the studios in late 1962 when Keith Grant was given the position of senior sound engineer. Another employee was Michael Ross-Trevor who eventually joined CBS Records at the start of a long career in classical music recording.\n\nStudio One was used by many influential groups including [[the Yardbirds]], [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]], [[Alexis Korner]], [[The Seekers]] and [[Graham Bond]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grahambond.org/discography.html|title=Graham Bond discography| publisher=grahambond.com|accessdate=21 October 2013}}</ref> The Rolling Stones<ref name=\"Olympic Studios, Scenta\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scenta.co.uk/music/cit/828718/the-very-best-of-british-recording-studios.htm|title=The very best of British recording studios|publisher=scenta.co.uk|accessdate=3 March 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822015513/http://www.engineeringuk.com/|archivedate=22 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> recorded their first single \"Come On\" at the studio, [[Dusty Springfield]] hits and [[the Troggs|Trogg]]'s single \"[[Wild Thing (Chip Taylor song)|Wild Thing]]\" were also recorded at Olympic during the 1960s. Olympic was a preferred recording studio with [[A&R]] staff who worked for record companies including [[Decca Records|Decca]], [[EMI]], [[Pye Records|Pye]] and [[Philips]]. The studios also hosted [[London Weekend Television]] music recordings.<ref name=\"Olympic by Nick Coleman\">{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/legendary-olympic-recording-studio-to-burn-out-1220725.html|title=Olympic Studios|author=Nick Coleman| date=1 February 2009| publisher=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=13 April 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Relocation to Barnes ==\nIn 1966, after  the lease on the Carlton Street premises was not renewed McKenzie sold his share of the business to [[Cliff Adams]] and [[John Shakespeare]] who moved the studios to [[Barnes, London|Barnes]] under the guidance of Keith Grant. Grant oversaw the development of the new studios bringing in his father Robertson Grant as an architect.<ref name=\"Keith Grant Interview\"/>  \n\nSituated at 117 Church Road, the Barnes building was constructed in 1906 and known as Byfeld Hall, a theatre for the Barnes Repertory Company. In its first decade it was a venue associated with the [[bioscope show|bioscope]], an early form of cinema combined with music hall and instrumentation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24639862|title=Olympic Studios Reborn|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=26 October 2008}}</ref> Between the 1930s and the post second world war era, it was a cinema. In the 1950s, the building became television production studios. Actors who played there included [[John Gielgud]] and [[Claude Rains]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympiccinema.co.uk/?page=8|title=Olympic Cinema \u2013 History|date= | publisher=Olympic Cinema|accessdate=17 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Barnes studios recording history ==\nApart from Roger Savage, several other young staff began their careers at Olympic. Among them was [[Gus Dudgeon]] who began as a tape operator and was later associated with [[Elton John]] and used Olympic Studios for sessions with John, as his producer. Engineer [[Eddie Kramer]] recalled that in 1967 \"Olympic Studios was at the cutting edge of technology. We were very innovative and of course we had [I think] the best console in England and possibly the world at the time\".<ref name=\"guitarworld\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/interview-engineer-eddie-kramer-recording-beatles-all-you-need-love|title=Engineer Eddie Kramer talks about the Beatles' All You Need Is Love|publisher=guitarworld|accessdate=21 October 2013}}</ref> \"We were ahead in terms of design.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov05/articles/classictracks.htm|title=Classic tracks :  Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Kramer|publisher=soundonsound.com|accessdate=8 January 2014}}</ref> The Rolling Stones were among the first clients of the new Olympic Studios in Barnes, consecutively recording six of their albums there between 1966 and 1972.<ref name=\"Olympic Studios Zani\" /> The Beatles worked at the studio to record the songs \"[[All You Need Is Love]]\" (1967),<ref name=\"guitarworld\"/> having been happy with their recording of the song \"[[Baby, You're a Rich Man]]\" (1967) on their first visit to Olympic. [[Jimi Hendrix]] recorded tracks for his album ''[[Are You Experienced]]'' (1967), the tracks for ''[[Axis: Bold as Love]]'' (1967) and a large part of ''[[Electric Ladyland]]'' (1968). [[The Who]] recorded their albums ''[[Who's Next]]'' and ''[[Who Are You]]'' there and it was used extensively by [[Led Zeppelin]], who recorded tracks there for all of their studio albums up to and including ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'' in 1975. In the same year [[Queen (band)|Queen]] used the studio for their album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and [[David Bowie]] used the studio at the same time. The studio also saw the production of other landmark albums and singles including tracks by [[Small Faces]], [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]], [[Blind Faith]], [[Hawkwind]], [[the Seekers]], [[the Moody Blues]], and [[Deep Purple]]. [[Procol Harum]] recorded all tracks for their album \"[[A Whiter Shade of Pale]]\" at Olympic.<ref name=\"Olympic by Nick Coleman\" />\n\nIn 1969, Grant commissioned his father to re-design studio Two as the now unexpectedly popular studio was causing problems with sound transmission to Studio One. Studio One, for example might be recording classical music by [[Elgar]] while Studio Two would be hosting sessions with the Rolling Stones. Robertson Grant successfully innovated a completely floating space weighing seventeen tons which was supported by rubber pads. The d\u00e9cor and furnishing of the new studio Two was designed by [[Mick Jagger]].<ref name=\"Keith Grant Interview\"/> Later on, Grant added probably the first instant acoustic change, using rough sawn wooden slats which could cover or reveal sound-absorbing panels behind them and change the acoustic sound. This made the room suitable for the recording of both rock and orchestral music at the pull of a cord.<ref name=\"Keith Grant Interview\"/>\n\nBy the turn of the 1970s, many orchestral works and film scores such as the original album version of the rock musical ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' were being recorded at Olympic. The studio produced film music for among others ''[[The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (film)|The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie]]'' (1968), ''[[The Italian Job]]'' (1969), the movie version of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar (film)|Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' (1973), ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' (recorded in studio Two in 1975 and ''[[Life of Brian]]'' (1979).\n\nOlympic's sound mixing desks were a creation of the maintenance staff and built specially for the studios. They became known as Olympic desks <ref name=\"Olympic mixing desks\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/legendary-olympic-recording-studio-to-burn-out-1220725.html| title=Olympic Studios|author=Nick Coleman|date=1 February 2009| work= [[The Independent]]| accessdate=13 April 2009}}</ref> developed by Dick Swettenham, Keith Grant and later Jim McBride in conjunction with Jim Dowler. Swettenham later started to manufacture the consoles commercially as Helios desks. The first desk of this type was commissioned by Grant as Helios One for studio Two. Olympic desks and their Helios spin off are still highly regarded for their sonic qualities today.<ref name=\"Sad day for Olympic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.realmusicforum.com/history/a-sad-day-for-music/20090326182/|title=Olympic Studios closes: A sad day for music|publisher=realmusicforum.com|accessdate=3 March 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808073558/http://www.realmusicforum.com/history/a-sad-day-for-music/20090326182/|archivedate=8 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Virgin Music era ==\nFor many years copyright problems with the use of the word Olympic prevented the history of the studio from being more widely promoted, which became an important factor in its arch-rival [[Abbey Road Studios]] attracting greater recognition due to promotion by E.M.I.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realmusicforum.com/history/a-sad-day-for-music/20090326182/|title=Olympic Studios|publisher=realmusicforum|accessdate=24 October 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808073558/http://www.realmusicforum.com/history/a-sad-day-for-music/20090326182/|archivedate=8 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1987, [[Virgin Music]] bought the studios and the property was refitted to a different practical and acoustic specification, further to consulting with Sam Toyoshima a Japanese studio builder who surprisingly declared the studio \"unfit to record music in\".<ref name=\"Olympic Studios, Scenta\" /> Barbara Jefferies, then Studio manager for [[Virgin Music]] at Olympic Studios,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smoothside.com/about.html|title=The Smoothside Organisation|author=Second Wave|publisher=smoothside.com|accessdate=3 March 2010|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Aqr4l21F?url=http://www.smoothside.com/about.html|archive-date=21 September 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> instructed that the master tapes of the studio's vast library of recording sessions be discarded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisbooksmusic.com/2008/12/15/|title=Some Stuffs: London\u2019s legendary Olympic Recording Studio to close|date=15 December 2008|publisher=thisisbooksmusic.com|accessdate=3 March 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712014716/http://www.thisisbooksmusic.com/2008/12/15/|archivedate=12 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The disposal of these tapes was unsecured they were put into skips outside the building, remaining there for days.
