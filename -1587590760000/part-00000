The park preserves about half of [[Mount Desert Island]], many adjacent smaller islands, and part of the [[Schoodic Peninsula]] on the coast of Maine. Acadia was initially designated [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons|Sieur de Monts]] [[National monument (United States)|National Monument]] by proclamation of President [[Woodrow Wilson]] in 1916. Sieur de Monts was renamed and redesignated [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] National Park by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1919\u2014the first national park in the United States east of the [[Mississippi River]] and the only one in the [[Northeastern United States]]. The park was renamed [[Acadia]] National Park in 1929. The park was named in Honor of the Acadia Brothers (Ari & Jerry) who were good friends of John D. Rockefeller, Jr. and had discovered it prior to Rockefeller making that area a summer residence. More than 3.5 million people visited the park in 2018.\n\n[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] nations have inhabited the area called Acadia for at least 12,000 years. They [[Fur trade|traded furs]] for European goods when French, English, and Dutch ships began arriving in the early 17th century. The [[Wabanaki Confederacy]] has held an annual Native American Festival in Bar Harbor since 1989. [[Samuel de Champlain]] named the island Isle des Monts Deserts (Island of Barren Mountains) in 1604. The island was granted to [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac]] by [[Louis XIV of France]] in 1688, then ceded to England in 1713. Summer visitors, nicknamed ''rusticators'', arrived in 1855, followed by wealthy families, nicknamed ''cottagers'' as their large houses were quaintly called [[cottage]]s. [[Charles Eliot (landscape architect)|Charles Eliot]] is credited with the idea for the park. [[George Dorr|George B. Dorr]], the \"Father of Acadia National Park,\" along with Eliot's father [[Charles William Eliot|Charles W. Eliot]], supported the idea through donations of land, and advocacy at the state and federal levels. [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]] financed the construction of carriage roads from 1915 to 1940. A wildfire in 1947 burned much of the park and destroyed 237 houses, including 67 of the millionaires\u2019 cottages.\n\nThe park includes mountains, an ocean coastline, coniferous and deciduous woodlands, lakes, ponds, and wetlands encompassing a total of {{convert|49,075|acre|sqmi km2|1}} {{as of|2017|lc=y}}. Key sites on Mount Desert Island include [[Cadillac Mountain]]\u2014the tallest mountain on the eastern coastline and one of the first places in the United States where one can watch the sunrise\u2014a rocky coast featuring Thunder Hole where waves crash loudly into a crevasse around high tides, a sandy swimming beach called Sand Beach, and numerous lakes and ponds. [[Jordan Pond]] features the glacially rounded North and South Bubbles ([[r\u00f4che moutonn\u00e9e]]s) at its northern end, while Echo Lake has the only freshwater swimming beach in the park. [[Somes Sound]] is a {{convert|5|mi|km|0|adj=on|spell=in}} long [[fjard]] formed during a [[glacial period]] that reshaped the entire island to its present form, including the [[U-shaped valley]]s containing the many ponds and lakes. The [[Bass Harbor Head Light]] is situated above a steep, rocky headland on the southwest coast\u2014the only lighthouse on the island.\n\nThe park protects the habitats of 37 [[mammal]]ian species including [[American black bear|black bear]]s, [[eastern moose|moose]] and [[white-tailed deer]], seven [[reptile|reptilian]] species including [[milk snake]]s and [[common snapping turtle|snapping turtles]], eleven [[amphibian]] species including [[wood frog]]s and [[spotted salamander]]s, 33 [[fish]] species including [[rainbow smelt]] and [[brook trout]], and as many as 331 [[bird]]s including various species of [[Bird of prey|raptors]], [[songbird]]s and [[Anseriformes|waterfowl]]. In 1991, [[peregrine falcon]]s had a successful nesting in Acadia for the first time since 1956. Falcon chicks are often banded to study migration, habitat use, and longevity. Some trails may be closed in spring and early summer to avoid disturbance to falcon nesting areas.\n\nRecreational activities from spring through autumn include car and bus touring along the park's paved loop road; hiking, bicycling, and horseback riding on carriage roads (motor vehicles are prohibited); rock climbing; kayaking and canoeing on lakes and ponds; swimming at Sand Beach and Echo Lake; sea kayaking and guided boat tours on the ocean; and various ranger-led programs. Winter activities include cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, snowmobiling, and ice fishing. Two campgrounds are located on Mount Desert Island, another campground is on the Schoodic Peninsula, and five [[lean-to]] sites are on Isle au Haut. The main visitor center is at Hulls Cove, northwest of Bar Harbor.\n\n==History==\n[[File:PenobscotBarkWigwamIn AcadiaPark.JPG|thumb|Replica of a [[Penobscot]] [[birch bark]] [[wigwam]]]]\n\n=== Native people ===\n[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] have inhabited the area called [[Acadia]] for at least 12,000 years, including the coastal areas of Maine, Canada, and adjacent islands.

[[Castine, Maine|Castine]] (''Pentagoet'' in the native language) was the grandchief's favored rendezvous site for the Wabanaki tribes. The site is located just west of Mount Desert Island at the mouth of the [[Bagaduce River]] in eastern [[Penobscot Bay]]. From 1615, Castine developed into a major [[Fur trade|fur trading]] post where French, English, and Dutch traders all fought for control. [[Sealskin]]s, [[moose]] [[Hide (skin)|hides]], and furs were traded by the Wabanakis for European commodities. By the early 1620s, warfare and introduced diseases, including [[smallpox]], [[cholera]] and [[influenza]], had decimated the tribes from Mount Desert Island southward to [[Cape Cod]], leaving about 10 percent of the original population.<ref name=Prins>Prins, Harald E.

The colony was destroyed a short time later by an armed vessel from the [[Colony of Virginia]] as the first act of overt warfare in the long struggle leading to the [[French and Indian Wars]]. The island was granted to [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac]] by [[Louis XIV of France]] in 1688, but ceded to England in 1713. [[Massachusetts]] governor [[Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet]] assumed control of the island in 1760. In 1790, Massachusetts granted the eastern half of the island to Cadillac's granddaughter, Mme. de Gregoire, while Bernard's son John retained ownership of the western half. The first record of summer visitors vacationing on the island was in 1855, and steamboat service from [[Boston]] was inaugurated in 1868. The [[Green Mountain Cog Railway]] was built from the shore of Eagle Lake to the summit of [[Cadillac Mountain]] in 1888. In 1901, the Maine Legislature granted Hancock County a charter to acquire and hold land on the island in the public interest.

The term ''rusticator'' was used to describe these early visitors who stayed in the homes of local fishermen and farmers for modest fees. Every summer the rusticators returned to renew friendships with local islanders and to enjoy the fresh salt air and relaxed pace.

Rivers and streams flowed again through the watershed, continuing the gradual erosion of the drainage paths.<ref name=npsgeology/>\n\n===Erosion and weathering===\n[[File:A080, Acadia National Park, Maine, USA, Otter Cove, 2002.jpg|thumb|Otter Cove from Otter Point]]\nAcadia has a coastline composed of rocky [[headland]]s, and more heavily eroded stony or sandy beaches. Coastal areas directly facing the [[Wind wave|wind-driven waves]] of the Atlantic Ocean are solely composed of large boulders as all other material has been washed out to sea. Areas partially protected by rocky headlands contain the remains of more eroded rocks, consisting of pebbles, [[Cobble (geology)|cobbles]] and smaller boulders. Sheltered coves, such as at Sand Beach, contain fine-grained particles that are primarily the remains of shells and other hard parts of marine life, including [[mussel]]s and [[sea urchin]]s.<ref name=npsgeology/>\n\nGranitic ridges are subjected to [[frost weathering]]. Joints, or fractures, are slowly enlarged as trapped water repeatedly freezes and melts, eventually splitting off a block. Bright pink scars with granitic rubble below are evidence of such weathering; one example can be seen above the [[Tarn (lake)|Tarn]], a pond just south of Bar Harbor.<ref name=npsgeology/>\n\nAt least twelve sea caves are located in several coastal areas of the park. Sea caves are formed when waves cause erosion of coastal rock formations. If a sea cave is enlarged enough, it may break through a [[headland]] to form a [[Natural arch#Coastline|sea arch]].<ref name=geodiversity>{{NPS|source=[https://www.nps.gov/articles/nps-geodiversity-atlas-acadia-national-park-maine.htm \"NPS Geodiversity Atlas\u2014Acadia National Park, Maine\"] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20181213101622/https://www.nps.gov/articles/nps-geodiversity-atlas-acadia-national-park-maine.htm archive]).

Ice storms are common in winter and early spring, while rain occurs throughout the year. Saturated soils, thawing, and heavy precipitation lead to [[rockfall]]s every spring along Mount Desert Island's loop road, as well as [[Slump (geology)|slumping]] along coastal bluffs.<ref name=geodiversity/>\n\n[[Mass wasting]] (slope movement) of [[marine clay]], deposited when the sea level was much higher, occurs along Hunters Brook on Mount Desert Island.

The park preserves about half of [[Mount Desert Island]], many adjacent smaller islands, and part of the [[Schoodic Peninsula]] on the coast of Maine. Acadia was initially designated [[Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons|Sieur de Monts]] [[National monument (United States)|National Monument]] by proclamation of President [[Woodrow Wilson]] in 1916. Sieur de Monts was renamed and redesignated [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] National Park by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1919\u2014the first national park in the United States east of the [[Mississippi River]] and the only one in the [[Northeastern United States]]. The park was renamed [[Acadia]] National Park in 1929. More than 3.5 million people visited the park in 2018.\n\n[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] nations have inhabited the area called Acadia for at least 12,000 years. They [[Fur trade|traded furs]] for European goods when French, English, and Dutch ships began arriving in the early 17th century. The [[Wabanaki Confederacy]] has held an annual Native American Festival in Bar Harbor since 1989. [[Samuel de Champlain]] named the island Isle des Monts Deserts (Island of Barren Mountains) in 1604. The island was granted to [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac]] by [[Louis XIV of France]] in 1688, then ceded to England in 1713. Summer visitors, nicknamed ''rusticators'', arrived in 1855, followed by wealthy families, nicknamed ''cottagers'' as their large houses were quaintly called [[cottage]]s. [[Charles Eliot (landscape architect)|Charles Eliot]] is credited with the idea for the park. [[George Dorr|George B. Dorr]], the \"Father of Acadia National Park,\" along with Eliot's father [[Charles William Eliot|Charles W. Eliot]], supported the idea through donations of land, and advocacy at the state and federal levels. [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]] financed the construction of carriage roads from 1915 to 1940. A wildfire in 1947 burned much of the park and destroyed 237 houses, including 67 of the millionaires\u2019 cottages.\n\nThe park includes mountains, an ocean coastline, coniferous and deciduous woodlands, lakes, ponds, and wetlands encompassing a total of {{convert|49,075|acre|sqmi km2|1}} {{as of|2017|lc=y}}. Key sites on Mount Desert Island include [[Cadillac Mountain]]\u2014the tallest mountain on the eastern coastline and one of the first places in the United States where one can watch the sunrise\u2014a rocky coast featuring Thunder Hole where waves crash loudly into a crevasse around high tides, a sandy swimming beach called Sand Beach, and numerous lakes and ponds. [[Jordan Pond]] features the glacially rounded North and South Bubbles ([[r\u00f4che moutonn\u00e9e]]s) at its northern end, while Echo Lake has the only freshwater swimming beach in the park. [[Somes Sound]] is a {{convert|5|mi|km|0|adj=on|spell=in}} long [[fjard]] formed during a [[glacial period]] that reshaped the entire island to its present form, including the [[U-shaped valley]]s containing the many ponds and lakes.

In 1991, [[peregrine falcon]]s had a successful nesting in Acadia for the first time since 1956. Falcon chicks are often banded to study migration, habitat use, and longevity. Some trails may be closed in spring and early summer to avoid disturbance to falcon nesting areas.\n\nRecreational activities from spring through autumn include car and bus touring along the park's paved loop road; hiking, bicycling, and horseback riding on carriage roads (motor vehicles are prohibited); rock climbing; kayaking and canoeing on lakes and ponds; swimming at Sand Beach and Echo Lake; sea kayaking and guided boat tours on the ocean; and various ranger-led programs. Winter activities include cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, snowmobiling, and ice fishing. Two campgrounds are located on Mount Desert Island, another campground is on the Schoodic Peninsula, and five [[lean-to]] sites are on Isle au Haut. The main visitor center is at Hulls Cove, northwest of Bar Harbor.\n\n==History==\n[[File:PenobscotBarkWigwamIn AcadiaPark.JPG|thumb|Replica of a [[Penobscot]] [[birch bark]] [[wigwam]]]]\n\n=== Native people ===\n[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] have inhabited the area called [[Acadia]] for at least 12,000 years, including the coastal areas of Maine, Canada, and adjacent islands.

[[Castine, Maine|Castine]] (''Pentagoet'' in the native language) was the grandchief's favored rendezvous site for the Wabanaki tribes. The site is located just west of Mount Desert Island at the mouth of the [[Bagaduce River]] in eastern [[Penobscot Bay]]. From 1615, Castine developed into a major [[Fur trade|fur trading]] post where French, English, and Dutch traders all fought for control. [[Sealskin]]s, [[moose]] [[Hide (skin)|hides]], and furs were traded by the Wabanakis for European commodities. By the early 1620s, warfare and introduced diseases, including [[smallpox]], [[cholera]] and [[influenza]], had decimated the tribes from Mount Desert Island southward to [[Cape Cod]], leaving about 10 percent of the original population.<ref name=Prins>Prins, Harald E.

The colony was destroyed a short time later by an armed vessel from the [[Colony of Virginia]] as the first act of overt warfare in the long struggle leading to the [[French and Indian Wars]]. The island was granted to [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac]] by [[Louis XIV of France]] in 1688, but ceded to England in 1713. [[Massachusetts]] governor [[Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet]] assumed control of the island in 1760. In 1790, Massachusetts granted the eastern half of the island to Cadillac's granddaughter, Mme. de Gregoire, while Bernard's son John retained ownership of the western half. The first record of summer visitors vacationing on the island was in 1855, and steamboat service from [[Boston]] was inaugurated in 1868. The [[Green Mountain Cog Railway]] was built from the shore of Eagle Lake to the summit of [[Cadillac Mountain]] in 1888. In 1901, the Maine Legislature granted Hancock County a charter to acquire and hold land on the island in the public interest.

These families had elegant estates constructed, which they called [[cottage]]s.

The collision buried the schist along with accumulations of sand and [[silt]], creating the Bar Harbor Formation which consists of brown and gray [[sandstone]] and [[siltstone]] layers. Material from volcanic flows and ash were also deposited on the formation, creating the volcanic rock found on the Cranberry Islands. Further volcanic activity introduced [[Igneous rock|igneous]] rocks into the Bar Harbor Formation.

The granite body rose slowly through bedrock, fracturing it into large pieces, some of which melted under intense heat. As the granite cooled, the bedrock fragments were left surrounded by crystallized granite in a shatter zone that is visible on the eastern side of the mountain.

That year, he guest starred on [[NBC]]'s sitcom ''The Martha Raye Show''.\n\nLynde returned to Broadway in 1960 when he was cast as Harry MacAfee, the father in ''[[Bye Bye Birdie]]''. He also played the role in the [[Bye Bye Birdie (film)|1963 film adaptation]]. That year, he recorded a live album, ''Recently Released'', issued as an [[LP record]]. All six tracks were written by him. Once he could afford writers, he rarely used his own material until his tenure on ''The Hollywood Squares'' years later.\n\nLynde was in great demand in the 1960s. During the 1961\u201362 television season he was a regular on NBC's ''[[The Perry Como Show]]'' as part of the Kraft Music Hall players with [[Don Adams]], [[Kaye Ballard]] and [[Sandy Stewart (singer)|Sandy Stewart]]. He was a familiar face on many [[sitcom]]s, including ''[[The Phil Silvers Show]]'', ''[[The Patty Duke Show]]'', ''[[The Munsters]]'', ''[[The Flying Nun]]'', ''[[Gidget (TV series)|Gidget]]'', ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'', ''[[F Troop]]'', and [[variety show]]s such as ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' and ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]''. He also was featured in a number of 1960s films, including ''[[Send Me No Flowers]]'' and ''[[The Glass Bottom Boat]]'', both starring [[Doris Day]].

Lynde also impressed series star [[Elizabeth Montgomery]] and her husband, director/producer [[William Asher]], who created a recurring role for Lynde as Endora's practical-joking brother [[List of Bewitched characters#Uncle Arthur|Uncle Arthur]]. Lynde made 10 appearances on ''Bewitched'' as the beloved character, the first being \"The Joker is a Card\" (air date October 14, 1965).

Eventually he assumed a permanent spot as the \"center square,\" a move that ensured that he would be called upon by contestants at least once in almost every round. Despite an urban legend to the contrary, Lynde remained in the center at the producers' discretion.\n\nOn ''The Hollywood Squares'', Lynde was best able to showcase his comedic talents with short, salty one-liners, spoken in his signature snickering delivery.<ref name=\"biog\" /> Many gags were thinly-veiled allusions to his [[homosexuality]]. Other jokes relied on [[double entendre]], an alleged fondness for deviant behaviors, or dealt with touchy subject matter for 1970s television.\n\nAppearing a total of 707 times, Lynde garnered considerable fame and wealth from the series.<ref>\"[[Peter Marshall (entertainer)|Peter Marshall]], [[Kaye Ballard]]\", ''[[E! True Hollywood Story]]'', 2000</ref> Lynde eventually became disenchanted with being what he called \"boxed into\" ''The Hollywood Squares'', and he departed the series in 1979. In 1980, ''The Hollywood Squares'' experienced a downward trend in [[Nielsen ratings]], and Lynde was approached about returning to the program. He initially declined, but changed his mind when told he would receive co-star billing with host Peter Marshall. He returned to the series in the spring of 1980 and remained with the show until its cancellation in February 1981.\n\n=== Voice acting ===\nBetween 1969 and 1973, Lynde did extensive [[voice actor|voice work]] on [[animated cartoon]]s, particularly those of [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]]. His most notable roles included:\n\n* '''Templeton''', the gluttonous rat in the [[animated feature]] ''[[Charlotte's Web (1973 film)|Charlotte's Web]]'';\n* '''Mildew Wolf''', from ''[[Cattanooga Cats#It's the Wolf!|It's the Wolf]]'' (a segment of ''[[Cattanooga Cats]]'');\n* '''Claude Pertwee''', neighbor on ''[[Where's Huddles?]]''; and\n* '''Sylvester Sneekly''' (aka \"The Hooded Claw\") in ''[[The Perils of Penelope Pitstop]]''.\n\nLynde's sardonic inflections added a dimension to such lines as the sly, drawn-out whine, \"What's in it for ''meeee?\"'' His distinctive voice remains popular among impressionists. Although it is sometimes assumed that actress [[Alice Ghostley]] based her speech patterns and mannerisms on Lynde's, according to actress [[Kaye Ballard]], \"It was Paul who was influenced by Alice\".<ref>{{cite news |author= Dennis McLellan |title = 'Bewitched's' Esmeralda Dies at 81 |url = http://www.zap2it.com/news/zap-aliceghostleyobit,0,7769067.story |work = [[The Los Angeles Times]] |date = 2007-09-22 | accessdate = 2013-07-29}}</ref>\n\n===''The Paul Lynde Show'' and ''Temperatures Rising''===\nIn 1972, Lynde starred in a short-lived [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom, ''[[The Paul Lynde Show]]''. The series was a contractual fulfillment to ABC in place of an aborted ninth season of ''Bewitched''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/paul-lynde-9542425#synopsis|title=Paul Lynde|website=Biography.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-01-25}}</ref>\n\nLynde starred as Paul Simms, an uptight attorney and father who was at odds with his liberal-minded son-in-law. The family included wife Martha ([[Elizabeth Allen (actress)|Elizabeth Allen]]), daughters Sally ([[Pamelyn Ferdin]]) and Barbara (Jane Actman), Barbara's husband Howie (John Calvin), and Howie's parents ([[Jerry Stiller]] and [[Anne Meara]]). \n\nCritics perceived the show as a derivative of ''[[All in the Family]],'' television's then most-popular primetime program, although many admitted the writing was top notch and the sexual connotations gave it an extra bit of spice. Lynde was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Television Series Musical or Comedy|Best Actor Golden Globe]] for the show. Scheduled opposite the first half of the Top 30 hit ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' on [[CBS]] and the Top 20 hit ''[[Adam-12]]'' on NBC, the series garnered low ratings and was canceled after a single season.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nContemporaneous media reports showed that viewers liked Lynde but not ''The Paul Lynde Show'', and liked another ABC show, ''[[Temperatures Rising]]'', but disliked co-star [[James Whitmore]]. Whitmore, unhappy himself, left the show and ABC moved Lynde to ''Temperatures Rising'' for the 1973\u201374 season. This move came despite the objections of [[William Asher]], producer of both shows, who also quit in protest of ABC's meddling.\n\nRatings for ''The New Temperatures Rising'' were even lower than the previous season, in part because Asher's replacements shifted the show's tone to a much darker one than the previous season. ABC cancelled the show and its time slot was taken by mid-season replacement ''[[Happy Days]]''.\n\nABC later decided to resuscitate the program, with additional cast changes (most notably, [[Alice Ghostley]], who replaced Sudie Bond in the role of Lynde's sister, Edwina). ABC also convinced Asher, who admitted Lynde's presence likely saved the series, to come back.

That year, he guest starred on [[NBC]]'s sitcom ''The Martha Raye Show''.\n\nLynde returned to Broadway in 1960 when he was cast as Harry MacAfee, the father in ''[[Bye Bye Birdie]]''. He also played the role in the [[Bye Bye Birdie (film)|1963 film adaptation]]. That year, he recorded a live album, ''Recently Released'', issued as an [[LP record]]. All six tracks were written by him. Once he could afford writers, he rarely used his own material until his tenure on ''The Hollywood Squares'' years later.\n\nLynde was in great demand in the 1960s. During the 1961\u201362 television season he was a regular on NBC's ''[[The Perry Como Show]]'' as part of the Kraft Music Hall players with [[Don Adams]], [[Kaye Ballard]] and [[Sandy Stewart (singer)|Sandy Stewart]]. He was a familiar face on many [[sitcom]]s, including ''[[The Phil Silvers Show]]'', ''[[The Patty Duke Show]]'', ''[[The Munsters]]'', ''[[The Flying Nun]]'', ''[[Gidget (TV series)|Gidget]]'', ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'', ''[[F Troop]]'', and [[variety show]]s such as ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' and ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]''. He also was featured in a number of 1960s films, including ''[[Send Me No Flowers]]'' and ''[[The Glass Bottom Boat]]'', both starring [[Doris Day]]. Lynde's best known sitcom role was on ''[[Bewitched]]''.\n\n=== ''Bewitched'' ===\n[[File:Uncle arthur bewitched 1968.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Lynde as Uncle Arthur with [[Elizabeth Montgomery]] in the 1968 ''Bewitched'' episode, \"The No Harm Charm\"]]\nIn 1965, Lynde made his debut appearance on ''[[Bewitched]]'' during the first-season episode \"Driving is the Only Way to Fly\" (air date March 25, 1965). His role as mortal Harold Harold, Samantha Stephens' nervous driving instructor, was well-received by viewers. Lynde also impressed series star [[Elizabeth Montgomery]] and her husband, director/producer [[William Asher]], who created a recurring role for Lynde as Endora's practical-joking brother [[List of Bewitched characters#Uncle Arthur|Uncle Arthur]]. Lynde made 10 appearances on ''Bewitched'' as the beloved character, the first being \"The Joker is a Card\" (air date October 14, 1965). Lynde, Montgomery and Asher became good friends, and were regularly seen together off the set.<ref name=salon/>\n\n===Television pilots===\nLynde starred in four failed television pilots in the 1960s:\n\n* ''Howie'' (1962, CBS)\n* ''Two's Company'' (1965, ABC)\n* ''Sedgewick Hawk-Styles: Prince of Danger'' (1966, ABC)\n* ''Manley and the Mob'' (1967, ABC)\n\nOf the four shows, only the Victorian detective spoof ''Sedgewick Hawk-Styles: Prince of Danger'' was initially picked up by ABC, only to be cancelled at the last minute. William Asher commented in the [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]'' episode on Lynde that ABC had reservations about Lynde, most notably his increasingly erratic offscreen behavior and the persistent rumors of his homosexuality.<ref name=\"biog\"/>\n\n===''The Hollywood Squares''===\n{{quote box\n|quote=\n'''Q:''' \"You're the world's most popular fruit.

Eventually he assumed a permanent spot as the \"center square,\" a move that ensured that he would be called upon by contestants at least once in almost every round. Despite an urban legend to the contrary, Lynde remained in the center at the producers' discretion.\n\nOn ''The Hollywood Squares'', Lynde was best able to showcase his comedic talents with short, salty one-liners, spoken in his signature snickering delivery.<ref name=\"biog\" /> Many gags were thinly-veiled allusions to his [[homosexuality]]. Other jokes relied on [[double entendre]], an alleged fondness for deviant behaviors, or dealt with touchy subject matter for 1970s television.\n\nAppearing a total of 707 times, Lynde garnered considerable fame and wealth from the series.<ref>\"[[Peter Marshall (entertainer)|Peter Marshall]], [[Kaye Ballard]]\", ''[[E! True Hollywood Story]]'', 2000</ref> Lynde eventually became disenchanted with being what he called \"boxed into\" ''The Hollywood Squares'', and he departed the series in 1979. In 1980, ''The Hollywood Squares'' experienced a downward trend in [[Nielsen ratings]], and Lynde was approached about returning to the program. He initially declined, but changed his mind when told he would receive co-star billing with host Peter Marshall. He returned to the series in the spring of 1980 and remained with the show until its cancellation in February 1981.\n\n=== Voice acting ===\nBetween 1969 and 1973, Lynde did extensive [[voice actor|voice work]] on [[animated cartoon]]s, particularly those of [[Hanna-Barbera Productions]]. His most notable roles included:\n\n* '''Templeton''', the gluttonous rat in the [[animated feature]] ''[[Charlotte's Web (1973 film)|Charlotte's Web]]'';\n* '''Mildew Wolf''', from ''[[Cattanooga Cats#It's the Wolf!|It's the Wolf]]'' (a segment of ''[[Cattanooga Cats]]'');\n* '''Claude Pertwee''', neighbor on ''[[Where's Huddles?]]''; and\n* '''Sylvester Sneekly''' (aka \"The Hooded Claw\") in ''[[The Perils of Penelope Pitstop]]''.\n\nLynde's sardonic inflections added a dimension to such lines as the sly, drawn-out whine, \"What's in it for ''meeee?\"'' His distinctive voice remains popular among impressionists. Although it is sometimes assumed that actress [[Alice Ghostley]] based her speech patterns and mannerisms on Lynde's, according to actress [[Kaye Ballard]], \"It was Paul who was influenced by Alice\".<ref>{{cite news |author= Dennis McLellan |title = 'Bewitched's' Esmeralda Dies at 81 |url = http://www.zap2it.com/news/zap-aliceghostleyobit,0,7769067.story |work = [[The Los Angeles Times]] |date = 2007-09-22 | accessdate = 2013-07-29}}</ref>\n\n===''The Paul Lynde Show'' and ''Temperatures Rising''===\nIn 1972, Lynde starred in a short-lived [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom, ''[[The Paul Lynde Show]]''.

The family included wife Martha ([[Elizabeth Allen (actress)|Elizabeth Allen]]), daughters Sally ([[Pamelyn Ferdin]]) and Barbara (Jane Actman), Barbara's husband Howie (John Calvin), and Howie's parents ([[Jerry Stiller]] and [[Anne Meara]]). \n\nCritics perceived the show as a derivative of ''[[All in the Family]],'' television's then most-popular primetime program, although many admitted the writing was top notch and the sexual connotations gave it an extra bit of spice. Lynde was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Television Series Musical or Comedy|Best Actor Golden Globe]] for the show. Scheduled opposite the first half of the Top 30 hit ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'' on [[CBS]] and the Top 20 hit ''[[Adam-12]]'' on NBC, the series garnered low ratings and was canceled after a single season.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nContemporaneous media reports showed that viewers liked Lynde but not ''The Paul Lynde Show'', and liked another ABC show, ''[[Temperatures Rising]]'', but disliked co-star [[James Whitmore]]. Whitmore, unhappy himself, left the show and ABC moved Lynde to ''Temperatures Rising'' for the 1973\u201374 season. This move came despite the objections of [[William Asher]], producer of both shows, who also quit in protest of ABC's meddling.\n\nRatings for ''The New Temperatures Rising'' were even lower than the previous season, in part because Asher's replacements shifted the show's tone to a much darker one than the previous season. ABC cancelled the show and its time slot was taken by mid-season replacement ''[[Happy Days]]''.\n\nABC later decided to resuscitate the program, with additional cast changes (most notably, [[Alice Ghostley]], who replaced Sudie Bond in the role of Lynde's sister, Edwina). ABC also convinced Asher, who admitted Lynde's presence likely saved the series, to come back. Seven further episodes were produced for summer 1974 airings, after which the series was permanently canceled.\n\n===Summer stock theatre===\nLynde was a fixture on the [[Kenley Players]] [[summer stock theatre]] circuit,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ecommons.udayton.edu/archives_morse_media/72/ | title=Paul Lynde Interview | publisher=University of Dayton | work=eCommons | accessdate=January 11, 2016}}</ref> appearing in ''[[Don't Drink the Water (play)|Don't Drink the Water]]'' (1970, 1979), ''[[The Impossible Years]]'' (1969, 1978), ''Mother is Engaged'' (1974), ''My Daughter is Rated X'' (1973), ''[[Plaza Suite]]'' (1971), and ''Stop, Thief, Stop!''

Authors Steve Wilson and Joe Florenski described Lynde as \"[[Liberace]] without a piano\" and that to most 1970s-era viewers, he was \"a frustrated bit player and character actor on a daytime game show\". To the homosexual community, his reputation was less than stellar: \"In some ways, he came to symbolize what's perceived to be a self-loathing era for gay culture.\"<ref name=\"salon\" />\n\nLynde's distinctive vocal delivery has also been widely imitated:\n\n*The character of Wilford Wolf in the animated series ''[[The Kwicky Koala Show]]'' is voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]] as an impersonation of Lynde.\n*Cartoon creator/voice actor [[Seth MacFarlane]] has acknowledged that the voice of [[Roger (American Dad!)|Roger the Alien]] on ''[[American Dad!]]'' was modeled after Lynde.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RycYlI3-7DU|title=American Dad! \u2013 Seth on Paul Lynde and Patrick Stewart|first=|last=The Paley Center for Media|date=5 October 2012|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n*The voice and humor of ''[[Queer Duck]]'' character Bi-Polar Bear, voiced by [[Billy West]], is performed in the style of Lynde, as is supervillain The Scoutmaster in ''The Simpsons'' episode \"[[Radioactive Man (The Simpsons episode)|Radioactive Man]]\".\n*[[Steve Carell]] reprised Lynde's role as \"Uncle Arthur\" in the 2005 film ''[[Bewitched (2005 film)|Bewitched]]'', very much in Lynde's style.\n*The voice of Big Cheese (voiced by [[Dean Hagopian]] in the show's English dub) on ''[[Samurai Pizza Cats]]'' is a Lynde impression.\n*The voice and humor of William A.

It is located on the north side of [[Cathedral Square, Moscow|Cathedral Square]] of the [[Moscow Kremlin]] in [[Russia]], where a narrow alley separates the north from the [[Church of the Twelve Apostles|Patriarch's Palace with the Twelve Apostles Church]]. Separately in the southwest, also separated by a narrow passage from the church, is the [[Palace of Facets]]. The Cathedral is regarded as the [[mother church]] of [[Muscovite Russia]]. In its present form it was constructed between 1475\u201379 at the behest of the Moscow Grand Duke [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]] by the Italian architect [[Aristotele Fioravanti]]. From 1547 to 1896 it was where the [[Coronation of the Russian monarch]] was held. In addition, it is the burial place for most of the Moscow [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]]s and [[Patriarch]]s of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and it also serves as a part of [[Moscow Kremlin Museums]].\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nArchaeological investigations in 1968 indicated that the site of the present Cathedral was a medieval burial ground, supporting the hypothesis that a wooden church existed on the site in the 12th century. This was replaced by a [[limestone]] structure built around 1326,<ref>''Moscow'', '''Northern Europe: International Dictionary of Historic Places''',  Vol. 2, ed. Trudy Ring, Noelle Watson, Paul Schellinger, (Routledge, 2013), 497.</ref> which is mentioned in historical records. \n\n[[Image:687px-Uspensky Sobor, Moscow, winter.jpg|thumb|left|The Cathedral of the Dormition, Moscow Kremlin (east fa\u00e7ade, winter).]]\n[[File:Moscow July 2011-3a.jpg|thumb|left|Northern door]]\nIn the 14th century, [[Metropolitan Peter]] persuaded [[Ivan I of Russia|Ivan I]] (Ivan Kalita) that he should build a [[cathedral]] to the [[Theotokos]] ([[Blessed Virgin Mary]]) in [[Moscow]] like the [[Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir|Cathedral of the Dormition]] in the capital city [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]]. Construction of the cathedral began on August 4, 1326, and the cathedral was finished and [[consecration|consecrated]] on August 4, 1327. At that time Moscow became the capital of the [[Vladimir-Suzdal']] principality.\n\n[[File:Moscow Kremlin AssumptionCathedral Reconstruction Zagraevsky.jpg|thumb|Dormition cathedral of Ivan Kalita. Reconstruction by [[Sergey Zagraevsky]].]]\n[[File:Graves in the Cathedral of the Assumptionl (Moscow) by shakko EN.jpg|thumb|Scheme of Metropolitans' and Patriarchs' graves in Cathedral.]]\n\nBy the end of the 15th century the old cathedral had become dilapidated, and in 1472 the [[Moscow]] architects Kryvtsov and Myshkin began construction of a new cathedral. Two years later, in May 1474, the building was nearing completion when it collapsed due to earthquake.<ref>Dmitri\u012d Olegovich Shvidkovski\u012d, ''Russian Architecture and the West'', (Yale University Press, 2007), 84.</ref>\n\n===Present structure===\nFollowing the disaster, [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]] then invited [[Aristotele Fioravanti]], a celebrated architect and engineer from [[Bologna]], [[Italy]], to come to Moscow and entrusted him with the task of designing the cathedral from scratch in the traditions of [[Russian architecture]].<ref>Mark M. Jarzombek, Vikramaditya Prakash and Francis D.K. Ching, ''A Global History of Architecture'', (John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2011), 544.</ref> The Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir was once again taken as a model for the building, and so Fioravanti travelled to Vladimir in order to study Russian methods of building. He designed a light and spacious masterpiece that combined the spirit of the [[Renaissance]] with Russian traditions. The foundation for the new cathedral was laid in 1475, and in 1479 the new cathedral was consecrated by [[Gerontius, Metropolitan of Moscow|Metropolitan Geronty]]. The interior was painted with [[fresco]]es and adorned with many [[icon]]s, including the [[Theotokos of Vladimir]] and [[Blachernitissa]].<ref name=Cracraft>{{cite book|author1=Cracraft, James|title=The Petrine Revolution in Russian Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gg19b0fFbIIC&pg=PA53 |year=1988 |publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-11664-8 |page=53}}</ref>\n\nThe design of the new church, with its five domes (symbolic of [[Jesus Christ]] and the [[Four Evangelists]]) proved immensely popular, and was taken as a template for numerous other churches throughout Russia.\n\nIn 1547 the [[coronation]] of the first Russian [[Tsar of Russia|Tsar]], [[Ivan the Terrible]], took place in this cathedral.<ref>Isabel de Madariaga, ''Ivan the Terrible'', (Yale University Press, 2005), 50.</ref> From 1721 it was the scene of the [[Coronation of the Russian monarch|coronation of the Russian emperors]]. The ritual installation of [[List of Metropolitans and Patriarchs of Moscow|metropolitans and patriarchs]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] also took place in this cathedral, and their tombs are to be found here. \n\nThe cathedral suffered from many disasters in its history, including fires in 1518, 1547, 1682, and 1737,<ref>''Seeing the Sights in Eighteenth century Russia: the Moscow Kremlin'', Lindsey Hughes, '''Eighteenth century Russia: society, culture, economy: Wittenberg 2004''', ed. Roger P. Bartlett, Gabriela Lehmann-Carli, (LIT Verlag Munster, 2007), 320.</ref> and looting under the armies of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] during the [[Time of Troubles]] in 1612. During the [[French invasion of Russia|French occupation of Russia]], it was looted and used as a horse stable.\n\nIt was thoroughly restored in 1894-1895 and from 1910-1918. On November 21, 1917, the cathedral was the setting for the installation of [[Tikhon]] (Belavin), the [[Metropolitan of Moscow]], as the first patriarch of the restored [[Patriarchate of Moscow]]. However, following the [[1917 Russian Revolution]], the new [[Bolshevik]] government closed all churches in the Moscow Kremlin, and converted the cathedral into a museum. By special permission from [[Vladimir Lenin]], the last [[Easter#Eastern Christianity|Pascha]] (Easter service) was held in 1918. The final moment of this Paschal service was the subject of an unfinished painting by [[Pavel Korin]] entitled ''Farewell to Rus''. Most of the church treasures were transferred to the [[Kremlin Armory]], or were sold overseas.\n\nThe building was repaired in 1949/50, 1960 and 1978.\n\nIn 1990 the Dormition Cathedral was returned to the church for periodic religious services, shortly before the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. It was restored to the Russian Orthodox Church in 1991.\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Blessed Be the Host of the King of Heaven\u2026 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|400px|''[[Blessed Be the Host of the King of Heaven]]'', the cathedral's famous icon measuring 4 meters in width]]\nDormition Cathedral is a tremendous six-pillared building with five apses and five domes. It was modeled after the Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir, in that it made extensive use of limestone masonry on a high limestone base, and was laid out as a three [[nave]] church with a vaulted cross-dome. It is built of well-trimmed white-stone blocks. However, Fioravanti did not use [[cantilever]] vaults as was common in Russian architecture, but introduced [[groin vault]]s and [[transverse arches]]. For the upper portion of the building, he used specially-made [[brick]]s, larger than the standard Russian size, which reduced weight and allowed for more slender arch supports. Thus, the easternmost pair of columns in front of the [[apse]]s are typically Russian in the use of massive rectangular open piers, whereas the remaining four are simpler [[Corinthian column]]s. The slim shape of these columns contributes significantly to the light, spacious effect of the interior.\n\nInside, the church decoration is dominated by its [[fresco]] painting. The huge [[iconostasis]] dates from 1547, but its two highest tiers are later additions from 1626 and 1653/1654 under [[Patriarch Nikon]]. In addition to its liturgical function, the iconostasis also served as a sort of trophy wall, in that Russian Tsars would add the most important icons from cities they had conquered to its collection. One of the oldest, ''icons with the bust of Saint George'' dates from the 12th century and was transferred to Moscow by Tsar [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan IV]] on the conquest of the city of Veliky Novgorod in 1561.\n\nHowever, one of the most important icons of the Russian Orthodox Church, the ''[[Theotokos of Vladimir]]'' kept at the Cathedral from 1395-1919 is now at the [[Tretyakov Gallery]]. \n\nNear the south entrance to the Cathedral is the Monomach Throne of Ivan IV (1551).\n\n==In the arts==\nThe plaza in front of the Cathedral is the setting for the famous Coronation Scene in [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky's]] opera ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]''.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Kremlvariousflickr08.jpg|Royal Procession door on the Cathedral \nFile:Moscow July 2011-3d.jpg|Northern portal\nFile:Iconostas uspenskiy.JPG|Portion of the [[Iconostasis]] and [[Holy Doors]] of Uspensky Cathedral.\nFile:Raka phillip.jpg|[[Reliquary]] of [[Philip II, Metropolitan of Moscow]].\nFile:Russia-Moscow-Kremlin Museums Exhibitions-12.jpg|Inside the [[nave]] of the Cathedral.\nFile:Uspenskii sobor v Moskve (1856) - Ivan Mikhailovich Snegirev.jpg|[[Ivan Snegiryov|Ivan Mikhailovich Snegirev]]: Dormition Cathedral, Moscow (1856)\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dormition of the Theotokos]]\n\n==References==\n*Klein, Mina.

It is located on the north side of [[Cathedral Square, Moscow|Cathedral Square]] of the [[Moscow Kremlin]] in [[Russia]], where a narrow alley separates the north from the [[Church of the Twelve Apostles|Patriarch's Palace with the Twelve Apostles Church]]. Separately in the southwest, also separated by a narrow passage from the church, is the [[Palace of Facets]]. The Cathedral is regarded as the [[mother church]] of [[Muscovite Russia]]. In its present form it was constructed between 1475\u201379 at the behest of the Moscow Grand Duke [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]] by the Italian architect [[Aristotele Fioravanti]]. From 1547 to 1896 it was where the [[Coronation of the Russian monarch]] was held. In addition, it is the burial place for most of the Moscow [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]]s and [[Patriarch]]s of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and it also serves as a part of [[Moscow Kremlin Museums]].\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nArchaeological investigations in 1968 indicated that the site of the present Cathedral was a medieval burial ground, supporting the hypothesis that a wooden church existed on the site in the 12th century. This was replaced by a [[limestone]] structure built around 1326,<ref>''Moscow'', '''Northern Europe: International Dictionary of Historic Places''',  Vol. 2, ed. Trudy Ring, Noelle Watson, Paul Schellinger, (Routledge, 2013), 497.</ref> which is mentioned in historical records. \n\n[[Image:687px-Uspensky Sobor, Moscow, winter.jpg|thumb|left|The Cathedral of the Dormition, Moscow Kremlin (east fa\u00e7ade, winter).]]\n[[File:Moscow July 2011-3a.jpg|thumb|left|Northern door]]\nIn the 14th century, [[Metropolitan Peter]] persuaded [[Ivan I of Russia|Ivan I]] (Ivan Kalita) that he should build a [[cathedral]] to the [[Theotokos]] ([[Blessed Virgin Mary]]) in [[Moscow]] like the [[Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir|Cathedral of the Dormition]] in the capital city [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]]. Construction of the cathedral began on August 4, 1326, and the cathedral was finished and [[consecration|consecrated]] on August 4, 1327. At that time Moscow became the capital of the [[Vladimir-Suzdal']] principality.\n\n[[File:Moscow Kremlin AssumptionCathedral Reconstruction Zagraevsky.jpg|thumb|Dormition cathedral of Ivan Kalita. Reconstruction by [[Sergey Zagraevsky]].]]\n[[File:Graves in the Cathedral of the Assumptionl (Moscow) by shakko EN.jpg|thumb|Scheme of Metropolitans' and Patriarchs' graves in Cathedral.]]\n\nBy the end of the 15th century the old cathedral had become dilapidated, and in 1472 the [[Moscow]] architects Kryvtsov and Myshkin began construction of a new cathedral. Two years later, in May 1474, the building was nearing completion when it collapsed due to earthquake.<ref>Dmitri\u012d Olegovich Shvidkovski\u012d, ''Russian Architecture and the West'', (Yale University Press, 2007), 84.</ref>\n\n===Present structure===\nFollowing the disaster, [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]] then invited [[Aristotele Fioravanti]], a celebrated architect and engineer from [[Bologna]], [[Italy]], to come to Moscow and entrusted him with the task of designing the cathedral from scratch in the traditions of [[Russian architecture]].<ref>Mark M. Jarzombek, Vikramaditya Prakash and Francis D.K. Ching, ''A Global History of Architecture'', (John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2011), 544.</ref> The Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir was once again taken as a model for the building, and so Fioravanti travelled to Vladimir in order to study Russian methods of building. He designed a light and spacious masterpiece that combined the spirit of the [[Renaissance]] with Russian traditions. The foundation for the new cathedral was laid in 1475, and in 1479 the new cathedral was consecrated by [[Gerontius, Metropolitan of Moscow|Metropolitan Geronty]]. The interior was painted with [[fresco]]es and adorned with many [[icon]]s, including the [[Theotokos of Vladimir]] and [[Blachernitissa]].<ref name=Cracraft>{{cite book|author1=Cracraft, James|title=The Petrine Revolution in Russian Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gg19b0fFbIIC&pg=PA53 |year=1988 |publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-11664-8 |page=53}}</ref>\n\nThe design of the new church, with its five domes (symbolic of [[Jesus Christ]] and the [[Four Evangelists]]) proved immensely popular, and was taken as a template for numerous other churches throughout Russia.\n\nIn 1547 the [[coronation]] of the first Russian [[Tsar of Russia|Tsar]], [[Ivan the Terrible]], took place in this cathedral.<ref>Isabel de Madariaga, ''Ivan the Terrible'', (Yale University Press, 2005), 50.</ref> From 1721 it was the scene of the [[Coronation of the Russian monarch|coronation of the Russian emperors]]. The ritual installation of [[List of Metropolitans and Patriarchs of Moscow|metropolitans and patriarchs]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] also took place in this cathedral, and their tombs are to be found here. \n\nThe cathedral suffered from many disasters in its history, including fires in 1518, 1547, 1682, and 1737,<ref>''Seeing the Sights in Eighteenth century Russia: the Moscow Kremlin'', Lindsey Hughes, '''Eighteenth century Russia: society, culture, economy: Wittenberg 2004''', ed. Roger P. Bartlett, Gabriela Lehmann-Carli, (LIT Verlag Munster, 2007), 320.</ref> and looting under the armies of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] during the [[Time of Troubles]] in 1612. During the [[French invasion of Russia|French occupation of Russia]], it was looted and used as a horse stable.\n\nIt was thoroughly restored in 1894-1895 and from 1910-1918. On November 21, 1917, the cathedral was the setting for the installation of [[Tikhon]] (Belavin), the [[Metropolitan of Moscow]], as the first patriarch of the restored [[Patriarchate of Moscow]]. However, following the [[1917 Russian Revolution]], the new [[Bolshevik]] government closed all churches in the Moscow Kremlin, and converted the cathedral into a museum. By special permission from [[Vladimir Lenin]], the last [[Easter#Eastern Christianity|Pascha]] (Easter service) was held in 1918. The final moment of this Paschal service was the subject of an unfinished painting by [[Pavel Korin]] entitled ''Farewell to Rus''. Most of the church treasures were transferred to the [[Kremlin Armory]], or were sold overseas.\n\nThe building was repaired in 1949/50, 1960 and 1978.\n\nIn 1990 the Dormition Cathedral was returned to the church for periodic religious services, shortly before the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. It was restored to the Russian Orthodox Church in 1991.\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Blessed Be the Host of the King of Heaven\u2026 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|400px|''[[Blessed Be the Host of the King of Heaven]]'', the cathedral's famous icon measuring 4 meters in width]]\nDormition Cathedral is a tremendous six-pillared building with five apses and five domes. It was modeled after the Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir, in that it made extensive use of limestone masonry on a high limestone base, and was laid out as a three [[nave]] church with a vaulted cross-dome. It is built of well-trimmed white-stone blocks. However, Fioravanti did not use [[cantilever]] vaults as was common in Russian architecture, but introduced [[groin vault]]s and [[transverse arches]]. For the upper portion of the building, he used specially-made [[brick]]s, larger than the standard Russian size, which reduced weight and allowed for more slender arch supports. Thus, the easternmost pair of columns in front of the [[apse]]s are typically Russian in the use of massive rectangular open piers, whereas the remaining four are simpler [[Corinthian column]]s. The slim shape of these columns contributes significantly to the light, spacious effect of the interior.\n\nInside, the church decoration is dominated by its [[fresco]] painting. The huge [[iconostasis]] dates from 1547, but its two highest tiers are later additions from 1626 and 1653/1654 under [[Patriarch Nikon]]. In addition to its liturgical function, the iconostasis also served as a sort of trophy wall, in that Russian Tsars would add the most important icons from cities they had conquered to its collection. One of the oldest, ''icons with the bust of Saint George'' dates from the 12th century and was transferred to Moscow by Tsar [[Ivan IV of Russia|Ivan IV]] on the conquest of the city of Veliky Novgorod in 1561.\n\nHowever, one of the most important icons of the Russian Orthodox Church, the ''[[Theotokos of Vladimir]]'' kept at the Cathedral from 1395-1919 is now at the [[Tretyakov Gallery]]. \n\nNear the south entrance to the Cathedral is the Monomach Throne of Ivan IV (1551).\n\n==In the arts==\nThe plaza in front of the Cathedral is the setting for the famous Coronation Scene in [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky's]] opera ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]''.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Kremlvariousflickr08.jpg|Royal Procession door on the Cathedral \nFile:Moscow July 2011-3d.jpg|Northern portal\nFile:Iconostas uspenskiy.JPG|Portion of the [[Iconostasis]] and [[Holy Doors]] of Uspensky Cathedral.\nFile:Raka phillip.jpg|[[Reliquary]] of [[Philip II, Metropolitan of Moscow]].\nFile:Russia-Moscow-Kremlin Museums Exhibitions-12.jpg|Inside the [[nave]] of the Cathedral.\nFile:Uspenskii sobor v Moskve (1856) - Ivan Mikhailovich Snegirev.jpg|[[Ivan Snegiryov|Ivan Mikhailovich Snegirev]]: Dormition Cathedral, Moscow (1856)\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dormition of the Theotokos]]\n\n==References==\n*Klein, Mina.

{"title_page": "Infamous Decree", "text_new": "[[Image:Napoleon1.jpg|thumb|]]\nOn March 17, 1808, [[Napoleon I]] made three decrees<ref>[https://books.google.be/books?id=S4RCAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA248 Pasinomie, XIV, p. 247]</ref> in a failed attempt to bring equality and to integrate the Jews into French society after the Jewish Emancipation of 1790\u20131791. The '''Infamous Decree''', the third of the three, had adverse effects. Although the decrees' aim was to further emancipate the Jews into equal citizenship, it restricted Jewish money lending (Catholics were not permitted to commit acts of usury, or the charging of interest as profit  on loans), it annulled all debts owed to Jews by non Jewish debtors and limited the residency of new Jewish peoples in France by restricting all business activities while allowing work in agriculture and regular craftsmanship. The combination of these decrees severely weakened the financial position of once dominant rural French money lending Jews.<ref>Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{further|Jewish emancipation|Napoleon and the Jews}}\n[[Napoleon Bonaparte]] initially won tge allegiance of Jews when, in 1797, he emancipated Jews in [[Ancona]], Italy. He officially chose two High Priests of the Jewish Nation and seven councillors to the High Priests. He allegedly encouraged Jews to reclaim [[Jerusalem]] in 1799 with the help of his army in a letter to a rabbi in [[Jerusalem]], but the letter is suspected by many to be a forgery. He in no way acted against the Jews until the early 19th century,<ref>Schwarzfuchs, Simon. Napoleon, the Jews and the Sanhedrin. Boston: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1979.</ref> when he passed a series of three decrees, one of which became known as the Infamous Decree. Some, such as author Franz Kobler, attribute the change in attitude to his new attachment to France and to his newfound desire to protect the interests of the French people. When he was the hero of the Jews, he still was an \"ardent patriot\" of his home island of [[Corsica]].<ref>Kobler, Franz. Napoleon and the Jews. New York, Schocken Books, 1975.</ref>\n\nIn France, quite early in the 19th century, Jewish moneylenders were accused of [[usury]] in [[Alsace]] as well as of abusing other rights, which were given to them in their emancipation in 1791 under King [[Louis XVI]]. Napoleon sided with popular French opinion. Though Napoleon desired equality for the Jews, he called them \"the most despicable of men\" and proclaimed he did not want their number to increase in an 1808 letter to his brother [[Jerome Bonaparte]].<ref>Schwarzfuchs, Simon. Napoleon, the Jews and the Sanhedrin. Boston: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1979.</ref>\n\nNapoleon issued an imperial decree in 1806 that suspended payment of debts owed to Jewish moneylenders for one year to warn against usury to the supposedly-degenerate Jewish population, and he called a conference with Jewish leaders, the Great [[Sanhedrin]].<ref>Schwarzfuchs, Simon. Napoleon, the Jews, and the Sanhedrin. Boston: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1979.</ref><ref>Kobler, Franz. Napoleon and the Jews. New York: Schocken Books, 1975.</ref>\n\nThough the first meeting of the Great Sanhedrin, on February 4, 1807, was ceremonial and solemn, the group was largely ineffective since nothing was done during the month they met to ameliorate the conditions on the Jews that would be imposed by the coming decrees. During the eight sessions, the Great [[Sanhedrin]] was forced to condone intermarriage between Frenchmen and Jews so that the Jewish people might be absorbed into France,<ref>Jaher, Frederic Cople. The Jews and the Nation: Revolution, Emancipation, State Formantion, and the Liberal Paradigm in America and France. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2002.</ref> since Jews were considered substandard citizens<ref>Schwarzfuchs, Simon. Napoleon, the Jews and the Sanhedrin. Boston: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1979.</ref> and needed to be either absorbed or expelled. The group also had to support other actions to assimilate the Jews by removing their Jewish ties, such as approving military service to attach young Jewish men to France, rather than their religion and ethnic background. Such measures were a prelude to the passing of the three decrees on March 17, 1808.<ref>Jaher, Frederic Cople. The Jews and the Nation: Revolution, Emancipation, State Formation, and the Liberal Paradigm in America and France. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2002.</ref>\n\n==History==\nAfter [[Napoleon]]\u2019s emancipation of the Jews he \"wanted to mandate what some proponents of emancipation had hoped would happen, namely the total assimilation, or biological fusion of Jews with the rest of the French people.\"<ref>Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.</ref> To mandate the assimilation of Jews into French society, three decrees were issued on March 17, 1808.<ref>Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.</ref>\n\nThe \"first two decrees restored order to the informal Jewish communities that had survived the revolution by establishing a hierarchical, centralized organization, under the aegis of the ministry of religions.\"<ref>Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.</ref> The first two decrees set up the [[consistory (Judaism)|consistories]] that were designed to enforce the decrees. Some of their members were also part of the Great [[Sanhedrin]], which met in 1807.<ref>Jaher, Frederic Cople. The Jews and the Nation: Revolution, Emancipation, State Formation, and the Liberal Paradigm in America and France. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2002.</ref> The [[Consistory (Judaism)|consistories]] consisted of a grand rabbi, possibly another rabbi and three lay members who were residents of the town. The consistories acted to enforce [[Sanhedrin]] rules through the use of education; they also worked as informants to the government to monitor Jewish activity.<ref>Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.</ref> There was one consistory for every town that contained 2,000 or more Jews.<ref>Berkovitz, Jay R. Rites and Passages: The Beginnings of Modern Jewish Culture in France. Philadelphia: University of Philadelphia Press, 2004.</ref>\n\nThe Infamous Decree, also known as the \"third decree,\" presumed all Jews guilty of chicanery (the use of trickery to achieve a political, financial or legal purpose) unless they were proven innocent, and it restricted Jewish commerce and money lending fo ten years.<ref>Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.</ref> The decree was put into place to end Jewish money lending. It annulled all debts owed to Jews by married women, minors and soldiers and voided any loan that had interest rates exceeding 10 percent. It was an attempt by Napoleon to get rid of alleged [[usury]] by Jewish businessmen and to turn former businessmen into craftsman and farmers to promote the supposed equality between the Jews and non-Jews in France.<ref>Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.</ref> To encourage Jews to move into that niche, they were restricted in changing residency to certain parts of France unless they \"acquired rural property and devoted themselves to agriculture without entering into any commercial or business transactions.\"<ref>The Jew in the Modern World: A Documentary History, edited by Paul Mendes-Flohr and Jehuda Reinharz. New York: Oxford University Press Inc., 1995.</ref> To watch the businesses that had survived the new restrictions, the decree mandated all business to acquire a patent or license, which had to be renewed yearly.<ref>Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.</ref> The decree hurt the Jews economically but also changed their military rights.<ref>Magnus, Shulamit S. Jewish Emancipation in a German City: Cologne, 1798-1871. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1997.</ref>\n\nThe final restriction of the Jews was an attempt to strengthen their bond with the government and the country. The decree made it so that the Jewish conscripts could no longer find replacements for themselves when they were drafted although other Frenchmen were allowed to do.<ref>Magnus, Shulamit S. Jewish Emancipation in a German City: Cologne, 1798-1871. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1997.</ref>\n\nAs a consequence of the first three decrees, a final decree was implemented on July 20, 1808. It declared that all Jews were to acquire a fixed family name to help the government and consistories supervise the Jews movements. They were restricted in their choice of names and could not allowed to pick names from the Hebrew Bible or any town names.<ref>Magnus, Shulamit S. Jewish Emancipation in a German City: Cologne, 1798-1871. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1997.</ref>\n\nThe three decrees were set up to expire after ten years unless they were renewed. In 1818, King [[Louis XVIII]] opted to not renew the decree, which thus expired. He was thereafter known as the \"liberator of Jews.\"<ref>Magnus, Shulamit S. Jewish Emancipation in a German City: Cologne, 1798-1871. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1997.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nAfter the decrees were not renewed after 10 years, Jews migrated into three main areas: Paris, Alsace and Lorraine. Indications of cultural and economical change can be seen in those areas. Although the changes were devastating to the economy of the Jews, they greatly increased the population and the distribution of the Jews.<ref>Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.</ref>\n\nMany Jews continued to live as lower-class citizens. They were peddlers, clothes dealers, cattle merchants and small-scale commercial agents. The decree made business in the French Jewry more difficult since it could not have gone into farming or artistry because other bans took away their ability to own any land or belong to guilds. The Jews could not use their commercial skills because without the ability to own land, the Jewish businessmen could not experience any kind of expansion. However, as time went by, more and more Jews began to go into artistry.<ref>Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.</ref> In Bordeaux, for example, 34 Jews worked as artisans and professionals. 66 Jews owned houses in the city and 39 were proprietors of rural land. Percentages of artisans in the city of [[Paris]] and [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] increased also. These different economical changes were accompanied by the union of Jewish youth in the public school system.<ref>Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.</ref>\n\nThere were many concerns with Jewish youth and the public school system. There was discrimination and talk of conversions. Only 10 percent of Jewish children attended public school in Alsace. One government Jewish official said, \"Our schools are Catholic schools rather than public schools. Prayers according to the Roman religion are recited upon entering and leaving, the catechism of the same religion is taught there and the textbook used are of that same religion.\" <ref>Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.</ref>\n\nBy 1810, a few Jews went to local schools and moved to [[Lyc\u00e9e]], but many Jewish parents neglected their children's education to prepare them into business. Jews gradually moved into public schools, and some even hired private tutors. Some parents home schooled their daughters to teach them music, dance and embroidery.<ref>Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.</ref>\n\nThe emancipation led to the redistribution of the Jewish population in France. Jews migrated to the cities and to communes where there had not previously been a Jewish population.<ref>Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.</ref> French Jews went to [[Paris]], by 1809 there were more than 2900 Jews there. The total Jewish population grew to more than 46,000 in Alsace.<ref>Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France.

Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2002.</ref> The [[Consistory (Judaism)|consistories]] consisted of a grand rabbi, possibly another rabbi and three lay members who were residents of the town. The consistories acted to enforce [[Sanhedrin]] rules through the use of education; they also worked as informants to the government to monitor Jewish activity.<ref>Hyman, Paula E.

Rites and Passages: The Beginnings of Modern Jewish Culture in France. Philadelphia: University of Philadelphia Press, 2004.</ref>\n\nThe Infamous Decree, also known as the \"third decree,\" presumed all Jews guilty of chicanery (the use of trickery to achieve a political, financial or legal purpose) unless they were proven innocent, and it restricted Jewish commerce and money lending fo ten years.<ref>Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.</ref> The decree was put into place to end Jewish money lending. It annulled all debts owed to Jews by married women, minors and soldiers and voided any loan that had interest rates exceeding 10 percent. It was an attempt by Napoleon to get rid of alleged [[usury]] by Jewish businessmen and to turn former businessmen into craftsman and farmers to promote the supposed equality between the Jews and non-Jews in France.<ref>Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.</ref> To encourage Jews to move into that niche, they were restricted in changing residency to certain parts of France unless they \"acquired rural property and devoted themselves to agriculture without entering into any commercial or business transactions.\"<ref>The Jew in the Modern World: A Documentary History, edited by Paul Mendes-Flohr and Jehuda Reinharz. New York: Oxford University Press Inc., 1995.</ref> To watch the businesses that had survived the new restrictions, the decree mandated all business to acquire a patent or license, which had to be renewed yearly.<ref>Hyman, Paula E.

Jewish Emancipation in a German City: Cologne, 1798-1871. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1997.</ref>\n\nThe final restriction of the Jews was an attempt to strengthen their bond with the government and the country. The decree made it so that the Jewish conscripts could no longer find replacements for themselves when they were drafted although other Frenchmen were allowed to do.<ref>Magnus, Shulamit S. Jewish Emancipation in a German City: Cologne, 1798-1871. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1997.</ref>\n\nAs a consequence of the first three decrees, a final decree was implemented on July 20, 1808. It declared that all Jews were to acquire a fixed family name to help the government and consistories supervise the Jews movements. They were restricted in their choice of names and could not allowed to pick names from the Hebrew Bible or any town names.<ref>Magnus, Shulamit S. Jewish Emancipation in a German City: Cologne, 1798-1871. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1997.</ref>\n\nThe three decrees were set up to expire after ten years unless they were renewed. In 1818, King [[Louis XVIII]] opted to not renew the decree, which thus expired. He was thereafter known as the \"liberator of Jews.\"<ref>Magnus, Shulamit S. Jewish Emancipation in a German City: Cologne, 1798-1871. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1997.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nAfter the decrees were not renewed after 10 years, Jews migrated into three main areas: Paris, Alsace and Lorraine. Indications of cultural and economical change can be seen in those areas. Although the changes were devastating to the economy of the Jews, they greatly increased the population and the distribution of the Jews.<ref>Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.</ref>\n\nMany Jews continued to live as lower-class citizens. They were peddlers, clothes dealers, cattle merchants and small-scale commercial agents. The decree made business in the French Jewry more difficult since it could not have gone into farming or artistry because other bans took away their ability to own any land or belong to guilds. The Jews could not use their commercial skills because without the ability to own land, the Jewish businessmen could not experience any kind of expansion. However, as time went by, more and more Jews began to go into artistry.<ref>Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.</ref> In Bordeaux, for example, 34 Jews worked as artisans and professionals. 66 Jews owned houses in the city and 39 were proprietors of rural land. Percentages of artisans in the city of [[Paris]] and [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] increased also. Thes\n different economical changes were accompanied by the union of Jewish youth in the public school system.<ref>Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.</ref>\n\nThere were many concerns with Jewish youth and the public school system. There was discrimination and talk of conversions. Only 10 percent of Jewish children attended public school in Alsace. One government Jewish official said, \"Our schools are Catholic schools rather than public schools. Prayers according to the Roman religion are recited upon entering and leaving, the catechism of the same religion is taught there and the textbook used are of that same religion.\" <ref>Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.</ref>\n\nBy 1810, a few Jews went to local schools and moved to [[Lyc\u00e9e]], but many Jewish parents neglected their children's education to prepare them into business. Jews gradually moved into public schools, and some even hired private tutors. Some parents home schooled their daughters to teach them music, dance and embroidery.<ref>Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.</ref>\n\nThe emancipation led to the redistribution of the Jewish population in France. Jews migrated to the cities and to communes where there had not previously been a Jewish population.<ref>Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France. London: University of California Press Ltd., 1998.</ref> French Jews went to [[Paris]], by 1809 there were more than 2900 Jews there. The total Jewish population grew to more than 46,000 in Alsace.<ref>Hyman, Paula E. The Jews of Modern France.

Gacy regularly performed at children's hospitals and charitable events as \"Pogo the Clown\" or \"Patches the Clown\", persona he devised. He was also active in his local community as a precinct captain and building contractor.\n\nIt is believed all of Gacy's known murders were committed inside his [[Ranch-style house|ranch house]] in [[Norridge, Illinois|Norridge]], a village in [[Norwood Park Township, Cook County, Illinois|Norwood Park]], [[Chicago metropolitan area|metropolitan Chicago]]. Gacy would typically lure a victim to his home, dupe him into donning [[handcuffs]] on the pretext of demonstrating a [[Magic (illusion)|magic trick]], then rape and torture his captive before killing him by either [[asphyxiation]] or [[strangulation]] with a [[garrote]]. Twenty-six victims were buried in the [[crawl space]] of his home, three others were buried elsewhere on his property, and the last four were discarded in the [[Des Plaines River]].\n\nGacy was convicted of the [[sodomy]] of a teenage boy in Iowa in 1968. He was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, but was released after 18 months. He first murdered in 1972, and at least 29 subsequent victims were killed after his divorce from his second wife in 1976. Investigation into the disappearance of [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]] teenager Robert Piest led to Gacy's arrest on December 21, 1978.\n\nThe conviction for 33 murders was the largest number of murders charged to one individual in United States until that time. Gacy was sentenced to death on March 13, 1980. On death row at [[Menard Correctional Center]] he spent much of his time painting. He was executed by [[lethal injection]] at [[Stateville Correctional Center]] on May 10, 1994.\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Wayne Gacy was born in Chicago, [[Illinois]] on March 17, 1942, the second child and only son of John Stanley Gacy (June 20, 1900 \u2013 December 25, 1969) and Marion Elaine Robinson (May 4, 1908 \u2013 December 6, 1989).<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 63.</ref> His father was an auto repair machinist and [[World War I]] veteran,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=24}} and his mother was a homemaker.<ref>Cook County marriage records provide his mother's name as Marion E.

He was close to his two sisters and mother but endured a difficult relationship with his father, an [[alcoholic]] who was [[physical abuse|physically abusive]] to his wife and children.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=256\u2013257}} Gacy seldom received his father's approval, later recollecting that, no matter what he achieved, he was \"never good enough\" in his father's eyes.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=31}}  His father regularly belittled him, calling him \"dumb and stupid\" and comparing him unfavorably with his sisters.<ref>''Serial Killers.'' pp. 54\u201355.</ref> Despite this, Gacy always denied ever hating his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=21}} \n\nOne of Gacy's earliest childhood memories was of being beaten with a leather belt at the age of four for accidentally disarranging car engine components his father had assembled.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=18\u201319}} On another occasion, he was struck across the head with a broomstick and rendered [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]].<ref>{{cite book | first1=Jason| last1=Moss| first2=Jeffrey| last2=Kottler| title=The Last Victim: A True-life Journey into the Mind of the Serial Killer| publisher=Grand Central Publishing| location=New York City| date=2000|isbn=0-7535-0398-0| p=103}}</ref> When he was six years old, Gacy stole a toy truck from a neighborhood store. His mother made him walk back to the store, return the toy and apologize to the owners. His mother informed his father, who beat Gacy with a belt as punishment. After this incident, Gacy's mother attempted to shield her son from his father's verbal and physical abuse,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=26}} yet this only succeeded in Gacy earning accusations that he was a \"[[sissy]]\" and a \"Mama's boy\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} who would \"probably grow up [[queer]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=40}}\n\nIn 1949, Gacy's father was informed that his son and another boy had been caught sexually fondling a young girl.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=218}} Gacy's father whipped him with a [[razor strop]] as punishment. The same year,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=17}} Gacy was [[child molestation|molested]] by a family friend,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} a contractor who would take Gacy for rides in his truck and then fondle him. Gacy never told his father about these incidents, afraid that his father would blame him.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\">''Serial Killers''. p. 54.</ref>\n\nBecause of a heart condition, Gacy was ordered to avoid all sports at school.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\" /> During the fourth grade, Gacy began to experience [[Syncope (medicine)|blackout]]s. He was occasionally hospitalized because of these seizures, and also in 1957 for a [[appendicitis|burst appendix]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=18}} Gacy later estimated that between the ages of 14 and 18, he had spent almost a year in the hospital for these episodes, and attributed the decline of his grades to his missing school. His father suspected the episodes were an effort to gain sympathy and attention, and openly accused his son of faking the condition as the boy lay in a hospital bed.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |issn=1364-5803 |page=5}}</ref> Although his mother, sisters, and few close friends never doubted his illness, Gacy's medical condition was never conclusively diagnosed.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=32}}\n\nOne of Gacy's friends at high school recalled several instances in which his father ridiculed or beat his son without provocation. On one occasion in 1957, the same friend witnessed an incident at the Gacy household in which Gacy's father began shouting at his son for no reason, then began hitting him.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=33}} Gacy's mother attempted to intervene. The friend recalled that Gacy simply \"put up his hands to defend himself\", adding that he never struck his father back during these physical altercations.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=32\u201333}}\n\n===Career origins===\nIn 1960, at the age of 18, Gacy became involved in politics, working as an assistant [[precinct captain]] for a [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] candidate in his neighborhood. This decision earned more criticism from his father, who accused his son of being a \"[[wikt:Special:Search/dupe|patsy]]\". Gacy later speculated the decision may have been an attempt to seek the acceptance from others that he never received from his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=36}}\n\nThe same year Gacy became a Democratic candidate, his father bought him a car, with the title of the vehicle being in his father's name until Gacy had completed the monthly repayments.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=42}} These repayments took several years to complete, and his father would confiscate the keys to the vehicle if Gacy did not do as his father said. On one occasion in 1962, Gacy bought an extra set of keys after his father confiscated the original set. In response, his father removed the [[distributor cap]] from the vehicle, withholding the component for three days. Gacy recalled that as a result of this incident, he felt \"totally sick; drained\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=44}} When his father replaced the distributor cap, Gacy left the family home and drove to [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], where he found work within the ambulance service before he was transferred to work as an attendant at Palm Mortuary.\n\nIn his role as a mortuary attendant, Gacy slept on a cot behind the [[embalming]] room.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tim|last=Cahill|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OF6itYw0HT0C&pg=PT30&lpg=PT30#v=onepage&q/ |title=Buried Dreams: Inside the Mind of a Serial Killer|publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |location=New York City|date=1986|access-date=March 14, 2013|isbn=978-0553051155}}</ref> He worked in this role for three months.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} In this role, he observed morticians embalming dead bodies and later confessed that, on one evening while alone, he had clambered into the coffin of a deceased teenage male, embracing and caressing the body before experiencing a sense of shock.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}}{{efn|Gacy later claimed to have engaged in acts of [[necrophilia]] on approximately two occasions while he worked at Palm Mortuary. He justified his actions by claiming the bodies he had defiled were \"just dead things\" who \"couldn't tell anybody\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=346}}}} This prompted Gacy to call his mother the next day and ask whether his father would allow him to return home.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}} His father agreed and the same day, Gacy drove back to live with his family in Chicago.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=347}}\n\nUpon his return, despite the fact he had failed to graduate from high school, Gacy successfully enrolled in the [[Northwestern College (Illinois)|Northwestern Business College]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=47}} from which he graduated in 1963. Gacy subsequently took a management trainee position within the Nunn-Bush Shoe Company.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=18\u201319}} In 1964, the shoe company transferred Gacy to [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] to work as a salesman.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} He was eventually promoted to manager of his department. In March of that year, he became engaged to Marlynn Myers, a co-worker in the department he managed.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}\n\nDuring his courtship with Marlynn, Gacy joined the local [[Jaycees]] and became a tireless worker for the organization, being named Key Man for the organization in April 1964.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 58.</ref> The same year, Gacy had his second homosexual experience. According to Gacy, he acquiesced to this incident after one of his colleagues in the Springfield Jaycees plied him with drinks and invited him to spend the evening upon his sofa; the colleague then performed [[oral sex]] upon him while he was drunk.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish Printworks|location=London, England|issn=1364-5803 |page=7}}</ref> By 1965, Gacy had risen to the position of vice-president of the Springfield Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=20\u201322}} The same year, he was named as the third most outstanding Jaycee within the state of Illinois.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=48}}\n\n==Waterloo, Iowa==\nAfter a six-month courtship, Gacy and Myers married in September 1964.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=219}} Marlynn's father subsequently purchased three [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] restaurants in [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]], [[Iowa]], and the couple moved to Waterloo so he could manage the restaurants, with the understanding that they would move into Marlynn's parents' home (which was vacated for the couple).{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=261\u2013262}} The offer was lucrative: Gacy would receive $15,000 per year (the equivalent of $115,513 {{as of|2020|lc=y|df=US}}), plus a share of profits earned via the restaurants.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=50}} Following his obligatory completion of a managerial course, Gacy relocated to Waterloo with his wife later that year.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=23\u201325}}\n\n=== Waterloo Jaycees ===\nIn Waterloo, Gacy joined the local chapter of the Jaycees, regularly offering extended hours to the organization in addition to the 12- and 14-hour days he worked managing three restaurants. Although considered ambitious and something of a braggart by other Jaycees, he was highly regarded for his fund-raising work. In 1967 he was named \"outstanding vice-president\" of the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=28}} At Jaycee meetings Gacy often provided fried chicken and insisted on being called \"Colonel\" (for [[Colonel Sanders]]).{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=51}} The same year, Gacy served on the Board of Directors for the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=51}}\n\nGacy's wife gave birth to a son in February 1966 and a daughter in March 1967. Gacy himself later described this period of his life as \"perfect\"{{snd}}he had earned his father's approval, which he had long sought. When Gacy's parents visited in July 1966, his father apologized for the abuse he had inflicted during Gacy's childhood, and said: \"Son, I was wrong about you.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=53}}\n\nMany Jaycees in Waterloo were involved in [[wife swapping]],<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> [[prostitution]], [[pornography]], and drug use; Gacy was deeply involved in many of these activities and regularly had sex with local prostitutes.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=263}} He opened a \"club\" in his basement where his employees could drink alcohol and play pool. Although Gacy employed teenagers of both sexes at his restaurants, he socialized only with his young male employees. Many were given alcohol before Gacy made sexual advances; if rebuffed, Gacy would claim these advances were jokes or a test of morals.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}}\n\n===Assault of Donald Voorhees===\nIn August 1967, Gacy committed his first known [[sexual assault]] upon a teenage boy. The victim was 15-year-old Donald Voorhees, the son of a fellow Jaycee. Gacy lured Voorhees to his house with the promise of showing him pornographic films.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=55}} Gacy plied Voorhees with alcohol and persuaded Voorhees to perform oral sex upon him. Over the following months, several other youths were sexually abused in a similar manner, including one whom Gacy encouraged to have sex with his own wife before [[blackmail]]ing him into performing oral sex upon him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}} Gacy tricked several teenagers into believing he was commissioned with conducting homosexual experiments in the interests of \"scientific research\", for which each was paid up to $50.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=266}}\n\nIn March 1968, Voorhees reported to his father that Gacy had sexually assaulted him. Voorhees Sr. immediately informed the police and Gacy was arrested and subsequently charged with oral [[Sodomy law|sodomy]] in relation to Voorhees and the attempted assault of 16-year-old Edward Lynch.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=267}} Gacy vehemently denied the charges and demanded to take a [[polygraph test]]. This request was granted, although the results indicated Gacy was nervous when he denied any wrongdoing in relation to either Voorhees or Lynch.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n\nGacy publicly denied any wrongdoing and insisted the charges against him were politically motivated \u2013 Voorhees Sr. had opposed Gacy's nomination for appointment as president of the Iowa Jaycees.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=66}} Several fellow Jaycees found Gacy's story credible and rallied to his support. However, on May 10, 1968, Gacy was indicted on the sodomy charge.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n{{quote box\n| quote = ''\"The most striking aspect of the test results is the patient's total denial of responsibility for everything that has happened to him.

Gacy promised to pay Schroeder $300 to lure Voorhees to a secluded spot, spray [[Mace (spray)|Mace]] in his face, and beat him. Schroeder agreed, and in early September, he lured Voorhees to an isolated county park, sprayed Mace into the youth's eyes, then beat him.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=72}}<ref name=\"Michael H.

Schroeder was arrested the following day. Despite initially denying any involvement, he soon confessed to having assaulted Voorhees, indicating that he had done so at Gacy's request.

He repeatedly denied that he had anything to do with Piest's disappearance and accused the officers of harassing him because of his political connections or because of his recreational drug use. Knowing these officers were unlikely to arrest him on anything trivial, he openly taunted them by flouting traffic laws and succeeded in losing his pursuers on more than one occasion.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=89}}\n\nOn December 17, investigators conducted a formal interview of Michael Rossi, who informed them Gacy had sold Szyc's vehicle to him with the explanation that he had bought the car from Szyc because Szyc needed money to move to California. A further examination of Gacy's Oldsmobile was conducted on this date. In the course of examining the trunk of the car, the investigators discovered a small cluster of fibers which may have been human hair. These fibers were sent for further analysis. That evening, officers conducted a test using three trained [[German shepherd]] [[Search and rescue dog|search dogs]] to determine whether Piest had been present in any of Gacy's vehicles.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}} The dogs were allowed to examine each of Gacy's vehicles, whereupon one dog approached Gacy's Oldsmobile and lay upon the passenger seat in what the dog's handler informed investigators was a \"death reaction\", indicating the body of Robert Piest had been present in this vehicle.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}}\n\nThat evening, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives to a restaurant for a meal.

At one point during this conversation, Gacy remarked to one of the two surveillance detectives: \"You know ... clowns can get away with murder.\"{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=226}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=90}}\n\n===Civil suit===\nBy December 18, Gacy was beginning to show visible signs of strain as a result of the constant surveillance: he was unshaven, looked tired, appeared anxious and was drinking heavily. That afternoon, he drove to his lawyers' office to prepare a $750,000 [[civil suit]] against the Des Plaines police,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=102}} demanding that they cease their surveillance. The same day, the serial number of the Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt found in Gacy's kitchen was traced to 17-year-old Kim Byers, a colleague of Piest at Nisson Pharmacy, who admitted when contacted in person the following day that she had worn the jacket on December 11 to shield herself from the cold and had placed the receipt in the [[Anorak|parka]] pocket just before she gave the coat to Piest as he left the store to talk with a contractor.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=110}} This revelation contradicted Gacy's previous statements that he had had no contact with Robert Piest on the evening of December 11.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|pp=116\u2013117}}\n\nThe same evening, Michael Rossi was interviewed a second time: on this occasion, Rossi was more cooperative, informing detectives that in the summer of 1977, Gacy had had him spread ten bags of [[Lime (material)|lime]] in the crawl space of the house.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}}\n\nOn December 19, investigators began compiling evidence for a second search warrant of Gacy's house. The same day, Gacy's lawyers filed the civil suit against the Des Plaines police. The hearing of the suit was scheduled for December 22. That afternoon, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives inside his house. On this occasion, as one officer distracted Gacy with conversation, another officer walked into Gacy's bedroom in an unsuccessful attempt to write down the serial number of the Motorola TV set they suspected belonged to John Szyc. While flushing Gacy's toilet, this officer noticed a smell he suspected could be that of rotting corpses emanating from a [[heating duct]]; the officers who previously searched Gacy's house had failed to notice this, as on that occasion the house had been cold.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nBoth David Cram and Michael Rossi were interviewed by investigators on December 20. Rossi had agreed to be interviewed in relation to his possible links with John Szyc as well as the disappearance of Robert Piest. When questioned by Kozenczak as to where he believed Gacy had placed Piest's body, Rossi replied: \"In the crawl space; he could have put him in the crawl space.\"<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 147</ref> A polygraph test showed his responses to questions to be inconclusive; however, upon his agreeing to a subsequent visual test in which a map of Cook County was divided into 12 [[Grid plan|grid sections]] numbered 1 to 12, with Gacy's home marked in the fourth grid section, Kozenczak noted an extreme response in Rossi's [[blood pressure]] when asked: \"Is the body of Robert Piest buried in grid number 4?\"<ref>Kozenczak, Joseph R.; Kozenczak, Karen M.

Cram then stated Gacy had grabbed a flashlight and immediately entered the crawl space to look for evidence of digging. When asked whether he had been to the crawl space, Cram replied he had once been asked by Gacy to spread lime down there and had also dug trenches upon Gacy's behest with the explanation they were for drainage pipes.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}} Cram stated these trenches were {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} wide, {{convert|6|ft|m|sp=us}} long and {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} deep\u2014the size of graves.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=143\u2013145}}\n\n===Verbal confession===\nOn the evening of December 20, Gacy drove to his lawyers' office in [[Park Ridge, Illinois|Park Ridge]] to attend a pre-scheduled meeting he had arranged with them, ostensibly to discuss the progress of his civil suit. Upon his arrival, Gacy appeared disheveled and immediately asked for an alcoholic drink, whereupon Sam Amirante fetched a bottle of whiskey from his car. Upon his return, Amirante asked Gacy what he had to discuss with them. Gacy picked up a copy of the ''[[Chicago Daily Herald|Daily Herald]]'' from Amirante's desk; he pointed to a front-page article covering the disappearance of Robert Piest and informed his lawyers: \"This boy is dead. He's in a river.\"{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=136}}\n\nOver the following hours, Gacy gave a rambling confession that ran into the early hours of the following morning. He began by informing Amirante and Stevens he had \"been the judge ... jury and executioner of many, many people\", and that he now wanted to be the same for himself.<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 127</ref> He stated most of his victims were buried in his crawl space, and others in the Des Plaines River. Gacy dismissed his victims as \"[[Male prostitution|male prostitutes]]\", \"hustlers\" and \"liars\" to whom he gave \"the rope trick\", adding that he occasionally awoke to find \"dead, strangled kids\" on his floor, with their hands cuffed behind their back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=171}}\n\nAs a result of the alcohol he had consumed, Gacy fell asleep midway through his confession and Amirante immediately arranged a psychiatric appointment for Gacy at 9:00&nbsp;a.m. that morning. Upon awakening several hours later, Gacy simply shook his head when informed by Amirante he had earlier confessed to killing approximately 30 people, stating: \"Well, I can't think about this right now. I've got things to do.\"<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\">Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150</ref> Ignoring his lawyers' advice regarding his scheduled appointment, Gacy left their office to attend to the needs of his business.<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\" />\n\nGacy later recollected his memories of his final day of freedom as being \"hazy\", adding that he knew his arrest was inevitable and that, in his final hours of freedom, he intended to visit his friends and say his final farewells.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=255\u2013258}} Upon leaving his lawyers' office, Gacy drove to a Shell gas station where, in the course of filling his rental car, he handed a small bag of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to the attendant, Lance Jacobson. Jacobson immediately handed the bag to the surveillance officers, adding that Gacy had told him: \"The end is coming (for me). These guys are going to kill me.\" Gacy then drove to the home of a fellow contractor, Ronald Rhode. Inside Rhode's living room, Gacy hugged Rhode before bursting into tears and saying: \"I've been a bad boy. I killed thirty people, give or take a few.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=257}} Gacy then left Rhode and drove to David Cram's home to meet with Cram and Rossi. As he drove along the expressway, the surveillance officers noted he was holding a [[Catholic rosary|rosary]] to his chin as he prayed while driving.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=152}}\n\nAfter talking with Cram and Rossi, Gacy had Cram drive him to a scheduled meeting with Leroy Stevens. As Gacy spoke with his lawyer, Cram informed the officers that Gacy had divulged to himself and Rossi that the previous evening, he had confessed to his lawyers his guilt in over thirty murders. Gacy then had Cram drive him to Maryhill Cemetery, where his father was buried.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=259}}\n\nAs Gacy drove to various locations that morning, police outlined their formal [[Draft document|draft]] of their second search warrant. The purpose of the warrant was specifically to search for the body of Robert Piest in the crawl space. Upon hearing from the surveillance detectives that, in light of his erratic behavior, Gacy may be about to commit suicide, police decided to arrest him upon a charge of possession and distribution of marijuana{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=157}} in order to hold him in custody as the formal request for a second search warrant was presented. At 4:30&nbsp;p.m. on December 21, the eve of the hearing of Gacy's civil suit, the request for a second search warrant was granted by Judge Marvin J. Peters.<ref>Kozenczak, (2012) p. 158</ref>\n\nArmed with the signed search warrant, police and evidence technicians drove to Gacy's home. Upon their arrival, officers found that Gacy had unplugged his [[sump pump]] and that the crawl space was flooded with water; to clear the water they simply replaced the plug and waited for the water to drain. After it had done so, evidence technician Daniel Genty entered the {{convert|28|x|38|ft|adj=on}} crawl space,<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 50.</ref> crawled to the southwest area, and began digging. Within minutes, he had uncovered [[putrefaction|putrefied]] flesh and a human arm bone. Genty immediately shouted to the investigators that they could charge Gacy with murder.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=167}} Genty added the remark: \"I think this place is full of kids.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=167}}\n\n==Arrest and confession==\n[[File:Gacysmilemugshot.png|thumb|left|upright=0.725|Gacy's [[mug shot]], taken December 22.]]\nAfter being informed that the police had found human remains in his crawl space and that he would now face murder charges, Gacy told officers he wanted to \"clear the air\",{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} adding that he had known his arrest was inevitable since the previous evening, which he had spent on the couch in his lawyers' office.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=170}}\n\nIn the early hours of December 22, 1978, Gacy confessed to police that since 1972, he had committed 25 to 30 murders, all of whom he falsely claimed were of teenage male [[Runaway (dependent)|runaway]]s or male prostitutes, the majority of whom he had buried in his crawl space.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=174}} Some victims he referred to by name, but most names he claimed not to know or remember.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|page=281}} He confessed he had buried the body of John Butkovich in his garage.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=188}} When asked where he drew the inspiration for the two-by-four attached with manacles at either end found at his house, Gacy stated he had been inspired to construct the device from reading about the [[Dean Corll|Houston Mass Murders]].{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=197}}{{efn|The Houston Mass Murders were a series of killings uncovered in 1973 in which Dean Corll, with two teenaged accomplices, had also used a wooden device (in their case a board fitted with handcuffs at each corner) to restrain their male victims throughout their sexual abuse and torture.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Man with the Candy: The Story of the Houston Mass Murders|last = Olsen|first = Jack|publisher = Simon and Schuster|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-439-12870-1 |page = 146}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = How to Make a Serial Killer: The Twisted Development of Innocent Children Into the World's Most Sadistic Murderers|last = Berry-Dee|first = Christopher|publisher = Ulysses Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-569-75943-1|location = |page = 202}}</ref> Gacy was likely inspired to construct this device, and to initially restrain his victims by tricking them into handcuffs, by press coverage relating to the Houston Mass Murders.{{sfn|Berry-Dee|2009|p=138}}}} In January 1979, he had planned to further conceal the corpses by covering the entire crawl space with concrete.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=222}} \n\nWhen specifically questioned about Piest, Gacy confessed to strangling him at his house on the evening of December 11 after luring him there.

Amirante has since stated that the primary inspiration for this legislation was the fact that at the time of the Gacy murders, there had been a 72-hour period which police in Illinois had to allow to elapse before initiating a search for a missing child or adolescent.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\nThe Illinois Missing Child Recovery Act of 1984 removed this 72-hour waiting period. Other states across America subsequently adopted similar procedures and sensibilities, as a result of which a national network aimed at locating missing children was gradually formed.

Gacy regularly performed at children's hospitals and charitable events as \"Pogo the Clown\" or \"Patches the Clown\", persona he devised. He was also active in his local community as a precinct captain and building contractor.\n\nIt is believed all of Gacy's known murders were committed inside his [[Ranch-style house|ranch house]] in [[Norridge, Illinois|Norridge]], a village in [[Norwood Park Township, Cook County, Illinois|Norwood Park]], [[Chicago metropolitan area|metropolitan Chicago]]. Gacy would typically lure a victim to his home, dupe him into donning [[handcuffs]] on the pretext of demonstrating a [[Magic (illusion)|magic trick]], then rape and torture his captive before killing him by either [[asphyxiation]] or [[strangulation]] with a [[garrote]]. Twenty-six victims were buried in the [[crawl space]] of his home, three others were buried elsewhere on his property, and the last four were discarded in the [[Des Plaines River]].\n\nGacy was convicted of the [[sodomy]] of a teenage boy in Iowa in 1968. He was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, but was released after 18 months. He first murdered in 1972, and at least 29 subsequent victims were killed after his divorce from his second wife in 1976. Investigation into the disappearance of [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]] teenager Robert Piest led to Gacy's arrest on December 21, 1978.\n\nThe conviction for 33 murders was the largest number of murders charged to one individual in United States until that time. Gacy was sentenced to death on March 13, 1980. On death row at [[Menard Correctional Center]] he spent much of his time painting. He was executed by [[lethal injection]] at [[Stateville Correctional Center]] on May 10, 1994.\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Wayne Gacy was born in Chicago, [[Illinois]] on March 17, 1942, the second child and only son of John Stanley Gacy (June 20, 1900 \u2013 December 25, 1969) and Marion Elaine Robinson (May 4, 1908 \u2013 December 6, 1989).<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 63.</ref> His father was an auto repair machinist and [[World War I]] veteran,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=24}} and his mother was a homemaker.<ref>Cook County marriage records provide his mother's name as Marion E.

He was close to his two sisters and mother but endured a difficult relationship with his father, an [[alcoholic]] who was [[physical abuse|physically abusive]] to his wife and children.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=256\u2013257}} Gacy seldom received his father's approval, later recollecting that, no matter what he achieved, he was \"never good enough\" in his father's eyes.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=31}}  His father regularly belittled him, calling him \"dumb and stupid\" and comparing him unfavorably with his sisters.<ref>''Serial Killers.'' pp. 54\u201355.</ref> Despite this, Gacy always denied ever hating his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=21}} \n\nOne of Gacy's earliest childhood memories was of being beaten with a leather belt at the age of four for accidentally disarranging car engine components his father had assembled.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=18\u201319}} On another occasion, he was struck across the head with a broomstick and rendered [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]].<ref>{{cite book | first1=Jason| last1=Moss| first2=Jeffrey| last2=Kottler| title=The Last Victim: A True-life Journey into the Mind of the Serial Killer| publisher=Grand Central Publishing| location=New York City| date=2000|isbn=0-7535-0398-0| p=103}}</ref> When he was six years old, Gacy stole a toy truck from a neighborhood store. His mother made him walk back to the store, return the toy and apologize to the owners. His mother informed his father, who beat Gacy with a belt as punishment. After this incident, Gacy's mother attempted to shield her son from his father's verbal and physical abuse,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=26}} yet this only succeeded in Gacy earning accusations that he was a \"[[sissy]]\" and a \"Mama's boy\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} who would \"probably grow up [[queer]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=40}}\n\nIn 1949, Gacy's father was informed that his son and another boy had been caught sexually fondling a young girl.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=218}} Gacy's father whipped him with a [[razor strop]] as punishment. The same year,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=17}} Gacy was [[child molestation|molested]] by a family friend,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} a contractor who would take Gacy for rides in his truck and then fondle him. Gacy never told his father about these incidents, afraid that his father would blame him.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\">''Serial Killers''. p. 54.</ref>\n\nBecause of a heart condition, Gacy was ordered to avoid all sports at school.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\" /> During the fourth grade, Gacy began to experience [[Syncope (medicine)|blackout]]s. He was occasionally hospitalized because of these seizures, and also in 1957 for a [[appendicitis|burst appendix]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=18}} Gacy later estimated that between the ages of 14 and 18, he had spent almost a year in the hospital for these episodes, and attributed the decline of his grades to his missing school. His father suspected the episodes were an effort to gain sympathy and attention, and openly accused his son of faking the condition as the boy lay in a hospital bed.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |issn=1364-5803 |page=5}}</ref> Although his mother, sisters, and few close friends never doubted his illness, Gacy's medical condition was never conclusively diagnosed.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=32}}\n\nOne of Gacy's friends at high school recalled several instances in which his father ridiculed or beat his son without provocation. On one occasion in 1957, the same friend witnessed an incident at the Gacy household in which Gacy's father began shouting at his son for no reason, then began hitting him.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=33}} Gacy's mother attempted to intervene. The friend recalled that Gacy simply \"put up his hands to defend himself\", adding that he never struck his father back during these physical altercations.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=32\u201333}}\n\n===Career origins===\nIn 1960, at the age of 18, Gacy became involved in politics, working as an assistant [[precinct captain]] for a [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] candidate in his neighborhood. This decision earned more criticism from his father, who accused his son of being a \"[[wikt:Special:Search/dupe|patsy]]\". Gacy later speculated the decision may have been an attempt to seek the acceptance from others that he never received from his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=36}}\n\nThe same year Gacy became a Democratic candidate, his father bought him a car, with the title of the vehicle being in his father's name until Gacy had completed the monthly repayments.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=42}} These repayments took several years to complete, and his father would confiscate the keys to the vehicle if Gacy did not do as his father said. On one occasion in 1962, Gacy bought an extra set of keys after his father confiscated the original set. In response, his father removed the [[distributor cap]] from the vehicle, withholding the component for three days. Gacy recalled that as a result of this incident, he felt \"totally sick; drained\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=44}} When his father replaced the distributor cap, Gacy left the family home and drove to [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], where he found work within the ambulance service before he was transferred to work as an attendant at Palm Mortuary.\n\nIn his role as a mortuary attendant, Gacy slept on a cot behind the [[embalming]] room.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tim|last=Cahill|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OF6itYw0HT0C&pg=PT30&lpg=PT30#v=onepage&q/ |title=Buried Dreams: Inside the Mind of a Serial Killer|publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |location=New York City|date=1986|access-date=March 14, 2013|isbn=978-0553051155}}</ref> He worked in this role for three months.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} In this role, he observed morticians embalming dead bodies and later confessed that, on one evening while alone, he had clambered into the coffin of a deceased teenage male, embracing and caressing the body before experiencing a sense of shock.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}}{{efn|Gacy later claimed to have engaged in acts of [[necrophilia]] on approximately two occasions while he worked at Palm Mortuary. He justified his actions by claiming the bodies he had defiled were \"just dead things\" who \"couldn't tell anybody\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=346}}}} This prompted Gacy to call his mother the next day and ask whether his father would allow him to return home.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}} His father agreed and the same day, Gacy drove back to live with his family in Chicago.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=347}}\n\nUpon his return, despite the fact he had failed to graduate from high school, Gacy successfully enrolled in the [[Northwestern College (Illinois)|Northwestern Business College]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=47}} from which he graduated in 1963. Gacy subsequently took a management trainee position within the Nunn-Bush Shoe Company.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=18\u201319}} In 1964, the shoe company transferred Gacy to [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] to work as a salesman.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} He was eventually promoted to manager of his department. In March of that year, he became engaged to Marlynn Myers, a co-worker in the department he managed.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}\n\nDuring his courtship with Marlynn, Gacy joined the local [[Jaycees]] and became a tireless worker for the organization, being named Key Man for the organization in April 1964.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 58.</ref> The same year, Gacy had his second homosexual experience.

Although considered ambitious and something of a braggart by other Jaycees, he was highly regarded for his fund-raising work. In 1967 he was named \"outstanding vice-president\" of the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=28}} At Jaycee meetings Gacy often provided fried chicken and insisted on being called \"Colonel\" (for [[Colonel Sanders]]).{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=51}} The same year, Gacy served on the Board of Directors for the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=51}}\n\nGacy's wife gave birth to a son in February 1966 and a daughter in March 1967. Gacy himself later described this period of his life as \"perfect\"{{snd}}he had earned his father's approval, which he had long sought.

Although Gacy employed teenagers of both sexes at his restaurants, he socialized only with his young male employees. Many were given alcohol before Gacy made sexual advances; if rebuffed, Gacy would claim these advances were jokes or a test of morals.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}}\n\n===Assault of Donald Voorhees===\nIn August 1967, Gacy committed his first known [[sexual assault]] upon a teenage boy. The victim was 15-year-old Donald Voorhees, the son of a fellow Jaycee. Gacy lured Voorhees to his house with the promise of showing him pornographic films.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=55}} Gacy plied Voorhees with alcohol and persuaded Voorhees to perform oral sex upon him. Over the following months, several other youths were sexually abused in a similar manner, including one whom Gacy encouraged to have sex with his own wife before [[blackmail]]ing him into performing oral sex upon him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}} Gacy tricked several teenagers into believing he was commissioned with conducting homosexual experiments in the interests of \"scientific research\", for which each was paid up to $50.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=266}}\n\nIn March 1968, Voorhees reported to his father that Gacy had sexually assaulted him. Voorhees Sr. immediately informed the police and Gacy was arrested and subsequently charged with oral [[Sodomy law|sodomy]] in relation to Voorhees and the attempted assault of 16-year-old Edward Lynch.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=267}} Gacy vehemently denied the charges and demanded to take a [[polygraph test]]. This request was granted, although the results indicated Gacy was nervous when he denied any wrongdoing in relation to either Voorhees or Lynch.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n\nGacy publicly denied any wrongdoing and insisted the charges against him were politically motivated \u2013 Voorhees Sr. had opposed Gacy's nomination for appointment as president of the Iowa Jaycees.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=66}} Several fellow Jaycees found Gacy's story credible and rallied to his support.

While Gacy was within earshot of 15-year-old, part-time employee Robert Piest, he mentioned that his firm hired teenage boys at a starting wage of $5 per hour\u2014almost double the pay Piest earned at the pharmacy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=5\u20136}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=4}}\n\nShortly after Gacy left the pharmacy, Piest informed his mother\u2014who had arrived at the pharmacy to drive her son home\u2014that \"some contractor wants to talk to me about a job\". Piest left the store, promising to return shortly.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=7}}  He was murdered shortly after 10:00&nbsp;p.m. at Gacy's home. Gacy later stated that as he placed the tourniquet around Piest's neck, the boy was \"crying, scared\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 140</ref> He also admitted to having received a phone call from a business acquaintance as Piest lay dying on his bedroom floor.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=231}}\n\n==Investigation==\n[[File:Piest1.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|Robert Piest, whose disappearance led to Gacy's arrest|alt=|left]]\nWhen Piest failed to return, his family filed a [[missing person]] report on their son with the Des Plaines police.

Kozenczak|Joseph Kozenczak]] chose to investigate Gacy further.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), pp. 26-27</ref>\n\nKozenczak and two other Des Plaines police officers visited Gacy at his home the following evening. Gacy indicated he had seen two youths working at the pharmacy and that he had asked one of them\u2014whom he believed to be Piest\u2014whether any remodeling materials were present in the rear of the store.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=19\u201321}} He was adamant, however, that he had not offered Piest a job and promised to come to the station later that evening to make a statement confirming this, indicating he was unable to do so at that moment as his uncle had just died. When questioned as to how soon he could come to the police station, he responded: \"You guys are very rude. Don't you have any respect for the dead?\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=240}}\n\nAt 3:20&nbsp;a.m., Gacy, covered in mud, arrived at the police station, claiming he had been involved in a car accident.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=23}} Upon returning to the police station later that day, Gacy denied any involvement in the disappearance of Piest and repeated that he had not offered him a job. When asked why he had returned to the pharmacy at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Gacy claimed he had done so in response to a phone call from Torf informing him he had left his appointment book at the store. Detectives had already spoken with Torf, who had stated he had placed no such call to Gacy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=27}} At the request of detectives, Gacy prepared a written statement detailing his movements on December 11.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=28}}\n\n===Revelations===\nDes Plaines police were convinced Gacy was behind Piest's disappearance and checked Gacy's record, discovering that he had an outstanding battery charge against him in Chicago and had served a prison sentence in Iowa for the sodomy of a 15-year-old boy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=17}} A search of Gacy's house on December 13 was ordered by a judge at the request of detectives and revealed several suspicious items. These included a [[syringe]], several police badges, and a 6mm Brevettata [[starter pistol]]. They also found handcuffs, books on homosexuality and [[pederasty]], a 39 inch long [[Dimensional lumber#Dimensional lumber|two-by-four]] with two holes drilled into each end,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=33}} several driver's licenses, a blue hooded parka and underwear too small to fit Gacy.<ref name=\"auto\">Kozenczak (2012), p. 61</ref>\n\nIn the northwest bedroom, investigators found a [[Maine West High School]] ring.

In an interview with Gacy's former wife the same day, they learned of the disappearance of John Butkovich.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=84}} The same day, the Maine West High School ring was traced to a John Alan Szyc.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=53\u201355}} An interview with Szyc's mother revealed that several items from her son's apartment were also missing, including a Motorola TV set.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 117</ref>\n\nBy December 16, Gacy was becoming affable with the surveillance detectives, regularly inviting them to join him for meals in restaurants and occasionally for drinks in bars or within his home. He repeatedly denied that he had anything to do with Piest's disappearance and accused the officers of harassing him because of his political connections or because of his recreational drug use. Knowing these officers were unlikely to arrest him on anything trivial, he openly taunted them by flouting traffic laws and succeeded in losing his pursuers on more than one occasion.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=89}}\n\nOn December 17, investigators conducted a formal interview of Michael Rossi, who informed them Gacy had sold Szyc's vehicle to him with the explanation that he had bought the car from Szyc because Szyc needed money to move to California. A further examination of Gacy's Oldsmobile was conducted on this date. In the course of examining the trunk of the car, the investigators discovered a small cluster of fibers which may have been human hair. These fibers were sent for further analysis. That evening, officers conducted a test using three trained [[German shepherd]] [[Search and rescue dog|search dogs]] to determine whether Piest had been present in any of Gacy's vehicles.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}} The dogs were allowed to examine each of Gacy's vehicles, whereupon one dog approached Gacy's Oldsmobile and lay upon the passenger seat in what the dog's handler informed investigators was a \"death reaction\", indicating the body of Robert Piest had been present in this vehicle.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}}\n\nThat evening, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives to a restaurant for a meal. In the early hours of December 18, he invited the same officers into another restaurant where, over breakfast, he talked of his business, his marriages and his activities as a registered clown. At one point during this conversation, Gacy remarked to one of the two surveillance detectives: \"You know ... clowns can get away with murder.\"{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=226}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=90}}\n\n===Civil suit===\nBy December 18, Gacy was beginning to show visible signs of strain as a result of the constant surveillance: he was unshaven, looked tired, appeared anxious and was drinking heavily. That afternoon, he drove to his lawyers' office to prepare a $750,000 [[civil suit]] against the Des Plaines police,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=102}} demanding that they cease their surveillance. The same day, the serial number of the Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt found in Gacy's kitchen was traced to 17-year-old Kim Byers, a colleague of Piest at Nisson Pharmacy, who admitted when contacted in person the following day that she had worn the jacket on December 11 to shield herself from the cold and had placed the receipt in the [[Anorak|parka]] pocket just before she gave the coat to Piest as he left the store to talk with a contractor.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=110}} This revelation contradicted Gacy's previous statements that he had had no contact with Robert Piest on the evening of December 11.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|pp=116\u2013117}}\n\nThe same evening, Michael Rossi was interviewed a second time: on this occasion, Rossi was more cooperative, informing detectives that in the summer of 1977, Gacy had had him spread ten bags of [[Lime (material)|lime]] in the crawl space of the house.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}}\n\nOn December 19, investigators began compiling evidence for a second search warrant of Gacy's house. The same day, Gacy's lawyers filed the civil suit against the Des Plaines police. The hearing of the suit was scheduled for December 22. That afternoon, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives inside his house. On this occasion, as one officer distracted Gacy with conversation, another officer walked into Gacy's bedroom in an unsuccessful attempt to write down the serial number of the Motorola TV set they suspected belonged to John Szyc. While flushing Gacy's toilet, this officer noticed a smell he suspected could be that of rotting corpses emanating from a [[heating duct]]; the officers who previously searched Gacy's house had failed to notice this, as on that occasion the house had been cold.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nBoth David Cram and Michael Rossi were interviewed by investigators on December 20. Rossi had agreed to be interviewed in relation to his possible links with John Szyc as well as the disappearance of Robert Piest. When questioned by Kozenczak as to where he believed Gacy had placed Piest's body, Rossi replied: \"In the crawl space; he could have put him in the crawl space.\"<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 147</ref> A polygraph test showed his responses to questions to be inconclusive; however, upon his agreeing to a subsequent visual test in which a map of Cook County was divided into 12 [[Grid plan|grid sections]] numbered 1 to 12, with Gacy's home marked in the fourth grid section, Kozenczak noted an extreme response in Rossi's [[blood pressure]] when asked: \"Is the body of Robert Piest buried in grid number 4?\"<ref>Kozenczak, Joseph R.; Kozenczak, Karen M.

Cram then stated Gacy had grabbed a flashlight and immediately entered the crawl space to look for evidence of digging. When asked whether he had been to the crawl space, Cram replied he had once been asked by Gacy to spread lime down there and had also dug trenches upon Gacy's behest with the explanation they were for drainage pipes.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}} Cram stated these trenches were {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} wide, {{convert|6|ft|m|sp=us}} long and {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} deep\u2014the size of graves.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=143\u2013145}}\n\n===Verbal confession===\nOn the evening of December 20, Gacy drove to his lawyers' office in [[Park Ridge, Illinois|Park Ridge]] to attend a pre-scheduled meeting he had arranged with them, ostensibly to discuss the progress of his civil suit. Upon his arrival, Gacy appeared disheveled and immediately asked for an alcoholic drink, whereupon Sam Amirante fetched a bottle of whiskey from his car. Upon his return, Amirante asked Gacy what he had to discuss with them. Gacy picked up a copy of the ''[[Chicago Daily Herald|Daily Herald]]'' from Amirante's desk; he pointed to a front-page article covering the disappearance of Robert Piest and informed his lawyers: \"This boy is dead. He's in a river.\"{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=136}}\n\nOver the following hours, Gacy gave a rambling confession that ran into the early hours of the following morning. He began by informing Amirante and Stevens he had \"been the judge ... jury and executioner of many, many people\", and that he now wanted to be the same for himself.<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 127</ref> He stated most of his victims were buried in his crawl space, and others in the Des Plaines River. Gacy dismissed his victims as \"[[Male prostitution|male prostitutes]]\", \"hustlers\" and \"liars\" to whom he gave \"the rope trick\", adding that he occasionally awoke to find \"dead, strangled kids\" on his floor, with their hands cuffed behind their back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=171}}\n\nAs a result of the alcohol he had consumed, Gacy fell asleep midway through his confession and Amirante immediately arranged a psychiatric appointment for Gacy at 9:00&nbsp;a.m. that morning. Upon awakening several hours later, Gacy simply shook his head when informed by Amirante he had earlier confessed to killing approximately 30 people, stating: \"Well, I can't think about this right now. I've got things to do.\"<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\">Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150</ref> Ignoring his lawyers' advice regarding his scheduled appointment, Gacy left their office to attend to the needs of his business.<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\" />\n\nGacy later recollected his memories of his final day of freedom as being \"hazy\", adding that he knew his arrest was inevitable and that, in his final hours of freedom, he intended to visit his friends and say his final farewells.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=255\u2013258}} Upon leaving his lawyers' office, Gacy drove to a Shell gas station where, in the course of filling his rental car, he handed a small bag of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to the attendant, Lance Jacobson. Jacobson immediately handed the bag to the surveillance officers, adding that Gacy had told him: \"The end is coming (for me). These guys are going to kill me.\" Gacy then drove to the home of a fellow contractor, Ronald Rhode. Inside Rhode's living room, Gacy hugged Rhode before bursting into tears and saying: \"I've been a bad boy. I killed thirty people, give or take a few.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=257}} Gacy then left Rhode and drove to David Cram's home to meet with Cram and Rossi. As he drove along the expressway, the surveillance officers noted he was holding a [[Catholic rosary|rosary]] to his chin as he prayed while driving.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=152}}\n\nAfter talking with Cram and Rossi, Gacy had Cram drive him to a scheduled meeting with Leroy Stevens. As Gacy spoke with his lawyer, Cram informed the officers that Gacy had divulged to himself and Rossi that the previous evening, he had confessed to his lawyers his guilt in over thirty murders. Gacy then had Cram drive him to Maryhill Cemetery, where his father was buried.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=259}}\n\nAs Gacy drove to various locations that morning, police outlined their formal [[Draft document|draft]] of their second search warrant. The purpose of the warrant was specifically to search for the body of Robert Piest in the crawl space. Upon hearing from the surveillance detectives that, in light of his erratic behavior, Gacy may be about to commit suicide, police decided to arrest him upon a charge of possession and distribution of marijuana{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=157}} in order to hold him in custody as the formal request for a second search warrant was presented. At 4:30&nbsp;p.m. on December 21, the eve of the hearing of Gacy's civil suit, the request for a second search warrant was granted by Judge Marvin J. Peters.<ref>Kozenczak, (2012) p. 158</ref>\n\nArmed with the signed search warrant, police and evidence technicians drove to Gacy's home. Upon their arrival, officers found that Gacy had unplugged his [[sump pump]] and that the crawl space was flooded with water; to clear the water they simply replaced the plug and waited for the water to drain. After it had done so, evidence technician Daniel Genty entered the {{convert|28|x|38|ft|adj=on}} crawl space,<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 50.</ref> crawled to the southwest area, and began digging. Within minutes, he had uncovered [[putrefaction|putrefied]] flesh and a human arm bone. Genty immediately shouted to the investigators that they could charge Gacy with murder.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=167}} Genty added the remark: \"I think this place is full of kids.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=167}}\n\n==Arrest and confession==\n[[File:Gacysmilemugshot.png|thumb|left|upright=0.725|Gacy's [[mug shot]], taken December 22.]]\nAfter being informed that the police had found human remains in his crawl space and that he would now face murder charges, Gacy told officers he wanted to \"clear the air\",{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} adding that he had known his arrest was inevitable since the previous evening, which he had spent on the couch in his lawyers' office.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=170}}\n\nIn the early hours of December 22, 1978, Gacy confessed to police that since 1972, he had committed 25 to 30 murders, all of whom he falsely claimed were of teenage male [[Runaway (dependent)|runaway]]s or male prostitutes, the majority of whom he had buried in his crawl space.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=174}} Some victims he referred to by name, but most names he claimed not to know or remember.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|page=281}} He confessed he had buried the body of John Butkovich in his garage.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=188}} When asked where he drew the inspiration for the two-by-four attached with manacles at either end found at his house, Gacy stated he had been inspired to construct the device from reading about the [[Dean Corll|Houston Mass Murders]].{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=197}}{{efn|The Houston Mass Murders were a series of killings uncovered in 1973 in which Dean Corll, with two teenaged accomplices, had also used a wooden device (in their case a board fitted with handcuffs at each corner) to restrain their male victims throughout their sexual abuse and torture.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Man with the Candy: The Story of the Houston Mass Murders|last = Olsen|first = Jack|publisher = Simon and Schuster|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-439-12870-1 |page = 146}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = How to Make a Serial Killer: The Twisted Development of Innocent Children Into the World's Most Sadistic Murderers|last = Berry-Dee|first = Christopher|publisher = Ulysses Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-569-75943-1|location = |page = 202}}</ref> Gacy was likely inspired to construct this device, and to initially restrain his victims by tricking them into handcuffs, by press coverage relating to the Houston Mass Murders.{{sfn|Berry-Dee|2009|p=138}}}} In January 1979, he had planned to further conceal the corpses by covering the entire crawl space with concrete.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=222}} \n\nWhen specifically questioned about Piest, Gacy confessed to strangling him at his house on the evening of December 11 after luring him there.

He underwent a variety of psychological tests before a panel of psychiatrists to determine whether he was mentally competent to stand trial.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=261}}{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=261\u2013262}}\n\nGacy had attempted to convince the doctors that he suffered from a [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]].{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=312}} Gacy claimed to have four personalities: contractor, clown, politician, and his fourth personality was a policeman called Jack Hanley. When Gacy confessed, he claimed to be relaying the crimes of Jack. His lawyers opted to have Gacy plead [[insanity plea|not guilty by reason of insanity]] to the charges against him. Presenting Gacy as a [[Jekyll-and-Hyde|Jekyll and Hyde]] character, the defense produced several psychiatric experts who had examined Gacy the previous year to testify to their findings.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=315\u2013323}} Three psychiatric experts at Gacy's trial testified they found Gacy to be a [[paranoid schizophrenic]] with a multiple personality disorder.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|pp=301}}<ref name=\"Michael H.

Those doctors refuted the defense doctors' claims of multiple personality and insanity. Cram and Rossi both confessed that Gacy had made them dig trenches in his crawl space. Cram testified that in August 1977, Gacy had marked a location in the crawl space with sticks and told him to dig a [[Drainage#Drainage in construction|drainage]] trench.<ref name=\"The Montreal Gazette Feb. 13, 1980\" />{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=181}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=311}}\n\nImmediately after Cram had completed his testimony, Rossi testified for the state. When asked where he had dug in the crawl space, Rossi turned to a diagram of Gacy's home on display in the courtroom. This diagram showed where the bodies were found in the crawl space and elsewhere on the property. Rossi pointed to the location of the remains of an unidentified victim known as \"Body 13\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=311}} Rossi stated he had not dug any other trenches, but\u2014at Gacy's request\u2014had supervised other PDM employees digging trenches in the crawl space.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=181}}\n\nBoth Rossi and Cram also testified that Gacy periodically looked into the crawl space to ensure they and other employees ordered to dig trenches in the crawl space did not deviate from the precise locations he had marked.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=312}} Gacy had testified after his arrest that he had only dug five of the victims' graves in his crawl space{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=142}} and had his employees (including Gregory Godzik) dig the remaining trenches so that he would \"have graves available\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=360}}\n\nOn February 18 Robert Stein,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=321}} the Cook County medical examiner who supervised the exhumations, testified that all the bodies were \"markedly decomposed<!--,--> [and] putrefied<!--, skeletalized remains-->\",<ref>{{cite news|title=Mother Cries at Description of Son's Grave|date=February 19, 1980 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VHVkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Mn4NAAAAIBAJ&pg=2366,5212913 |newspaper=The Calgary Herald |accessdate=October 24, 2018}}</ref> and that of all the autopsies he performed, thirteen victims had died of asphyxiation, six of ligature strangulation, one of multiple stab wounds to the chest,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=102}} and ten in undetermined ways.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=322}}{{efn|Stein performed autopsies on each victim recovered at Gacy's property and upon the body of Robert Piest.

Asked whether Gacy appreciated the criminality of his actions, Rignall said he believed that Gacy was unable to conform his actions to the law's expectations because of the \"beastly and animalistic ways he attacked me\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 290</ref> During specific cross-examination relating to the torture, Rignall vomited and was excused from further testimony.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=300}}\n\nOn February 29, Donald Voorhees, whom Gacy had sexually assaulted in 1967, testified to his ordeal at Gacy's hands, and that Gacy had subsequently paid another youth to beat him and spray Mace in his face so he would not testify against him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}} Voorhees felt unable to testify, but did briefly attempt to do so, before being asked to step down.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}}\n\nRobert Donnelly testified the week after Voorhees, recounting his ordeal at Gacy's hands in December 1977. Donnelly was visibly distressed as he recollected the abuse he endured at Gacy's hands and came close to breaking down on several occasions. As Donnelly testified, Gacy repeatedly laughed at him,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=333}} but Donnelly finished his testimony. One of Gacy's defense attorneys, Robert Motta, during Donnelly's cross-examination, attempted to discredit his testimony, but Donnelly did not waver from his testimony of what had occurred.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=345}}\n\nDuring the fifth week of the trial, Gacy wrote a personal letter to Judge Garippo requesting a [[mistrial]]{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=342}} on a number of bases, including that he did not approve his lawyers' insanity plea approach; that his lawyers had not allowed him to take the witness stand (as he had desired to do); that his defense had not called enough witnesses, and that the police were lying about statements he had purportedly made to detectives after his arrest and that, in any event, the statements were \"self-serving\" for use by the prosecution.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=350\u2013351}} Judge Garippo addressed Gacy's letter by informing him that under the law he had the choice as to whether he wished to testify, and he was free to indicate as much to the judge if he wished to do so.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=312}}\n\n===Closing arguments===\nOn March 11, final arguments from both prosecution and defense attorneys began, with the arguments concluding on the following day. Prosecuting attorney Terry Sullivan argued first, outlining Gacy's history of abusing youths, the testimony of his efforts to avoid detection and describing Gacy's surviving victims\u2014Voorhees and Donnelly\u2014as \"living dead\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}} Referring to Gacy as the \"worst of all murderers\",<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 324</ref> Sullivan stated: \"John Gacy has accounted for more human devastation than many earthly catastrophes, but one must tremble. I tremble when thinking about just how close he came to getting away with it all.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}}\n\nAfter the state's four-hour closing, counsel Sam Amirante argued for the defense. Amirante argued against the testimony delivered by the doctors who had testified for the prosecution, repeatedly citing the testimony of the four psychiatrists and psychologists who had testified on behalf of the defense.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=360}} Amirante also accused Sullivan of scarcely referring to the evidence presented throughout the trial in his own closing argument, and of arousing hatred against his client. The defense lawyer attempted to portray Gacy as a \"man driven by compulsions he was unable to control\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=363}}\n\nIn support of these arguments, the defense counsel repeatedly referred to the testimony of the doctors who had appeared for the defense, in addition to the testimony of defense witnesses such as Jeffrey Rignall and Gacy's former business associate Mickel Reed\u2014both of whom had testified to their belief that Gacy had been unable to control his actions.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=359}} Amirante then urged the jury to put aside any prejudice they held against his client, and requested they deliver a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, adding that the psychology of Gacy's behavior would be of benefit to scientific research and that the psychology of his mind should be studied.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=361}}\n\n[[File:Kunkletrial.jpg|upright=1|thumb|William Kunkle, prosecutor at Gacy's trial, standing before a board depicting the 22 victims identified by February 1980.]]\nOn the morning of March 12,{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=364}} William Kunkle continued to argue for the prosecution. Kunkle referred to the defense's contention of insanity as \"a [[falsity|sham]]\", arguing that the facts of the case demonstrated Gacy's ability to think logically and control his actions. Kunkle also referred to the testimony of a doctor who had examined Gacy in 1968. This doctor had diagnosed Gacy as an [[antisocial personality]], capable of committing crimes without remorse. Kunkle indicated that had the recommendations of this doctor been heeded, Gacy would have not been freed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}}\n\nAt the close of his argument, Kunkle pulled each of the 22 photos of Gacy's identified victims off a board displaying the images and asked the jury not to show sympathy but to \"show justice\". Kunkle then asked the jury to \"show the same sympathy this man showed when he took these lives and put them ''there!''{{-\"}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}} before throwing the stack of photos into the opening of the trap door of Gacy's crawl space, which had been introduced as evidence and was on display in the courtroom.

Amirante has since stated that the primary inspiration for this legislation was the fact that at the time of the Gacy murders, there had been a 72-hour period which police in Illinois had to allow to elapse before initiating a search for a missing child or adolescent.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\nThe Illinois Missing Child Recovery Act of 1984 removed this 72-hour waiting period. Other states across America subsequently adopted similar procedures and sensibilities, as a result of which a national network aimed at locating missing children was gradually formed. This national network has since developed into the Child Abduction Emergency\u2014commonly known today as an [[Amber Alert]].{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\n==Potential accomplices and connections==\nOne of the first things Gacy told investigators after his arrest was that he had not acted alone in several of the murders: he asked whether \"my associates\" had also been arrested.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} When questioned as to whether these associates had participated directly or indirectly in the killings, Gacy replied, \"Directly.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}}\n\nGacy specifically named Cram and Rossi as being involved in several of the murders.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} In the 1980s, he also informed [[Robert Ressler]] that \"two or three\" PDM employees had assisted him in several murders.<ref>Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} pp 341\u2013342</ref> Ressler replied that he believed there were unexplained avenues to the case and stated his belief that Gacy had killed more than 33 victims.

At the bar, the officers overheard a hushed conversation between Gacy and one of his employees in which the employee asked Gacy, \"And what? Buried like the other five?\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=102}}\n\nIn interviews following his arrest and conviction, Gacy repeatedly claimed that he was not present in Chicago when 16 of the identified victims had disappeared. In one interview, he stated that at the time of his arrest, four PDM employees were also considered suspects in the disappearances of the missing boys investigators had linked to Gacy\u2014all of whom he stated were in possession of keys to his house.<ref>Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} pp=341\u2013342</ref> One of these employees was Philip Paske, a young man who is known to have been a close associate of John Norman.
