He received them while on a retreat in a mountain cave at Hira, just outside the city of Makkah in 610 CE. A few commentators disagree with this account, claiming that the first revelation was the beginning of surat [[al-Muddaththir]] or surat [[al-Fatiha]], but theirs is a minority position. Moreover, the term \u2018Insan\u2019 which is translated to man or human appears 65 times in the Qur'an, applying to both sexes of mankind, a generic \u2018man\u2019.<ref>Haleem, M. A.. The Qur'an: a new translation. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008.</ref>\n\nThe concept of a divinity telling a human to speak is found in many cultures, and parallels have been drawn between Muhammad's experience and that recounted by [[Beda Venerabilis]] in what is called \"[[Caedmon's Hymn]]\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Caedmon und Muhammed|first=Klaus|last=von See|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Deutsches Altertum und Deutsche Literatur|volume=112|issue=4|year=1983|pages=225\u2013233|jstor=20656695}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=The Qur'an: Source or Analogue of Bede's Caedmon Story?|last=Thundy|first=Z. P.|year=1989|journal=Islamic Culture|volume=63|issue=3|pages=105\u2013110\n}}</ref>\n\n== Verses 6\u201319 ==\nThe remainder of the sura, claimed to have been revealed later, questions the morality and beliefs of mankind, who \"thinks himself self-sufficient\", unaware that all things will return to their Lord. Once man becomes self-satisfied, he has the tendency to transgress. These ayahs were revealed shortly after Muhammed started to pray publicly, as many people questioned his actions. The text continues, addressing the impiety of \"the man who forbids Our servant to pray\". These later lines are thought to date from the time when Muhammad began to [[prayer|pray]] the [[salat]] in the Kaaba. Abu Jahl attempted to interrupt the prayer by trampling on Muhammad's neck while he was prostrated. \"Does he not realize that God sees all?\"\nThe Qur'an commands Muhammad (and by inference all believers) to continue the prayer regardless, as those who persecute the faithful are unaware that God sees what they do. After the first 8 ayahs were revealed, Muhammed left the cave at Hira, and then surahs Ad-Duha, Nashra, and the second part of this surah were revealed after 6 months. \nMore specifically, ayahs 9\u201314 were revealed when Muhammed first began praying publicly near the Ka\u2019Bah because the Meccans didn't comprehend what he was doing. These were directed towards people who tried to stop others from making devotions toward Allah. Once Abu Jahl (member of the Quraish) saw Muhammed praying publicly, he thought that Muhammed had adopted a new religion and tried to drive him away from the Ka\u2019Bah. He gathered a crowd and asked: \u201cIs Muhammed setting his face on the ground in front of you (praying)?\u201d When they replied in affirmative he said: \u201cby the gods Al-Lat and Al-Uzza, if I ever catch him in that act of worship (salah), I will set my foot on his neck and rub his face in the dust.\u201d Abu Jahl wanted to follow through on his threat, but when he saw Muhammed he stepped forward, motioned to put his foot on his neck, but then became frightened and left. When asked about it later, he said that he had seen a vision of a ditch right in front of Muhammed, filled with fire and a ghoul with fiery wings. After Muhammed heard about the remark, he said: \u201cif he would have come near me, the angels would have struck him down and torn him into pieces.\u201d\nMore specifically, ayahs 15\u201319 were about when Abu Jahl saw Muhammed pray again near the Ka\u2019Bah, and  said \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you not to do this!\u201d The prophet scolded him and said that he had the right to pray here, because he was a born citizen of Makkah. Abu Jahl said \u201cyou dare to scold me! By God, with one call I can fill this valley with supporters!\u201d This passage was revealed: \u201cIf (Abu Jahl) would have called upon his men, the angel of punishment would have seized him.\u201d These ayahs are more about the punishment that Abu Jahl (or any transgressor) would encounter, if he would have interrupted Muhammed (or a devotee) during prayer.\n\nThe translated words \u2018bow down\u2019 in verse 19 comes from the word \u2018Sujud\u2019 which refers to the position in Muslim prayer where the head, hands, knees, and toes are on the ground.<ref>Haleem, M. A.. The Qur'an: a new translation. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008.</ref>\n\n== Specific Ayah Meanings ==\n\nAyahs 1\u20133: These ayahs are talking about how Allah created human beings from Alaq (clay / mud). After this ayah was revealed, Muhammed responded by saying that he didn't know how to read. After angel Jibraeel squeezed Muhammed's chest a few times, and the 3rd ayah was revealed, Muhammed read even though he did not know how to read or write. \nAyahs 4\u20135: These ayah stress the importance of an education for a Muslim. As time goes on, things progress and advance, and everything comes from Allah. Allah opens peoples brains to new things, and this ayah stresses the importance of furthering your education. This hadeeth in relation to this ayah was revealed which says: \u201ca person who reads is handsome in the eyes of Allah.\u201d\nAyah 6\u20138: Even though Allah does so many things for us we still disobey him. Some people say that they do not need Allah. It does not matter because everyone will return to him on the Day of Judgement for reckoning.\nAyahs 9\u201310: In this ayah \u201cthe one who discourages\u201d references Abu Jahl when he tried to stop Muhammed from making devotions towards Allah, and anyone else for that matter.\nAyahs 11\u201314: These ayahs question whether the \u201cone who discourages\u201d is being \u201cguided\u201d or even \u201cconcerned\u201d about god. They also emphasize that if someone is praying not to stop them because Allah is always watching.\nAyahs 15\u201319: These ayahs explain why the person who interrupts someone in prayer is said that they will be dragged from their \u201clying, sinful, forelock.\u201d This phrase comes from Abu Jahl, who in the battle of Badr was killed by the hands of 2 child orphans of Medinah. His body was thrown into a well and they dragged him by his hair, which is specifically in reference to ayah 15.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n\n{{Sura|96|[[At-Tin]]|[[Al-Qadr]]}}\n[[Category:Chapters in the Quran|Alaq]]\n[[Category:609]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Iqra}} \n\n{{Infobox surah\n| number         = 96\n| number-3       = 096\n| name           = Al-\u02bbAlaq\n| name-ar        = \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0642\n| name-en        = The Clot\n| prev_sura      = Surat al-Tin\n| next_sura      = Surat al-Qadr\n| classification = Meccan\n| othernames-ar  = \u0633\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0625\u0642\u0631\u0627 (S\u016brat Iqr\u0101)\n| othernames     = The Embryo, The Clinging Form, The Clinging-Clot, The Clot, The Germ-Cell, Read \n| juz            = 30 \n| rukus          = <!-- if only one ruku, skip this field -->\n| verses         = 19\n| words          = <!-- optional, uncommon -->\n| letters        = <!-- optional, uncommon -->\n| muqattaat      = <!-- only if applicable -->\n| sajdahs        = <!-- only if applicable -->\n| audio          = <!-- optional, if exists -->\n}}\n{{Quran}}\n[[Image:Iqra.jpg|thumb|right|Egyptian Calligraphy of the first lines of Sura al-Alaq]]\n'''Al-\u02bbAlaq''' ({{lang-ar| \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0642}}, \"The Clot\" or \"The Clinging Thing\"), is the 96th chapter ([[s\u016brah]]) of the [[Qur'an]].

A few commentators disagree with this account, claiming that the first revelation was the beginning of surat [[al-Muddaththir]] or surat [[al-Fatiha]], but theirs is a minority position. Moreover, the term \u2018Insan\u2019 which is translated to man or human appears 65 times in the Qur'an, applying to both sexes of mankind, a generic \u2018man\u2019.<ref>Haleem, M. A.. The Qur'an: a new translation. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008.</ref>\n\nThe concept of a divinity telling a human to speak is found in many cultures, and parallels have been drawn between Muhammad's experience and that recounted by [[Beda Venerabilis]] in what is called \"[[Caedmon's Hymn]]\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Caedmon und Muhammed|first=Klaus|last=von See|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Deutsches Altertum und Deutsche Literatur|volume=112|issue=4|year=1983|pages=225\u2013233|jstor=20656695}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=The Qur'an: Source or Analogue of Bede's Caedmon Story?|last=Thundy|first=Z. P.|year=1989|journal=Islamic Culture|volume=63|issue=3|pages=105\u2013110\n}}</ref>\n\n== Verses 6\u201319 ==\nThe remainder of the sura, claimed to have been revealed later, questions the morality and beliefs of mankind, who \"thinks himself self-sufficient\", unaware that all things will return to their Lord. Once man becomes self-satisfied, he has the tendency to transgress. These ayahs were revealed shortly after Muhammed started to pray publicly, as many people questioned his actions. The text continues, addressing the impiety of \"the man who forbids Our servant to pray\". These later lines are thought to date from the time when Muhammad began to [[prayer|pray]] the [[salat]] in the Kaaba. Abu Jahl attempted to interrupt the prayer by trampling on Muhammad's neck while he was prostrated. \"Does he not realize that God sees all?\"\nThe Qur'an commands Muhammad (and by inference all believers) to continue the prayer regardless, as those who persecute the faithful are unaware that God sees what they do. After the first 8 ayahs were revealed, Muhammed left the cave at Hira, and then surahs Ad-Duha, Nashra, and the second part of this surah were revealed after 6 months. \nMore specifically, ayahs 9\u201314 were revealed when Muhammed first began praying publicly near the Ka\u2019Bah because the Meccans didn't comprehend what he was doing. These were directed towards people who tried to stop others from making devotions toward Allah. Once Abu Jahl (member of the Quraish) saw Muhammed praying publicly, he thought that Muhammed had adopted a new religion and tried to drive him away from the Ka\u2019Bah. He gathered a crowd and asked: \u201cIs Muhammed setting his face on the ground in front of you (praying)?\u201d When they replied in affirmative he said: \u201cby the gods Al-Lat and Al-Uzza, if I ever catch him in that act of worship (salah), I will set my foot on his neck and rub his face in the dust.\u201d Abu Jahl wanted to follow through on his threat, but when he saw Muhammed he stepped forward, motioned to put his foot on his neck, but then became frightened and left. When asked about it later, he said that he had seen a vision of a ditch right in front of Muhammed, filled with fire and a ghoul with fiery wings. After Muhammed heard about the remark, he said: \u201cif he would have come near me, the angels would have struck him down and torn him into pieces.\u201d\nMore specifically, ayahs 15\u201319 were about when Abu Jahl saw Muhammed pray again near the Ka\u2019Bah, and  said \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you not to do this!\u201d The prophet scolded him and said that he had the right to pray here, because he was a born citizen of Makkah. Abu Jahl said \u201cyou dare to scold me! By God, with one call I can fill this valley with supporters!\u201d This passage was revealed: \u201cIf (Abu Jahl) would have called upon his men, the angel of punishment would have seized him.\u201d These ayahs are more about the punishment that Abu Jahl (or any transgressor) would encounter, if he would have interrupted Muhammed (or a devotee) during prayer.\n\nThe translated words \u2018bow down\u2019 in verse 19 comes from the word \u2018Sujud\u2019 which refers to the position in Muslim prayer where the head, hands, knees, and toes are on the ground.<ref>Haleem, M. A.. The Qur'an: a new translation. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008.</ref>\n\n== Specific Ayah Meanings ==\n\nAyahs 1\u20133: These ayahs are talking about how Allah created human beings from Alaq (clay / mud). After this ayah was revealed, Muhammed responded by saying that he didn't know how to read. After angel Jibraeel squeezed Muhammed's chest a few times, and the 3rd ayah was revealed, Muhammed read even though he did not know how to read or write. \nAyahs 4\u20135: These ayah stress the importance of an education for a Muslim. As time goes on, things progress and advance, and everything comes from Allah. Allah opens peoples brains to new things, and this ayah stresses the importance of furthering your education. This hadeeth in relation to this ayah was revealed which says: \u201ca person who reads is handsome in the eyes of Allah.\u201d\nAyah 6\u20138: Even though Allah does so many things for us we still disobey him. Some people say that they do not need Allah. It does not matter because everyone will return to him on the Day of Judgement for reckoning.\nAyahs 9\u201310: In this ayah \u201cthe one who discourages\u201d references Abu Jahl when he tried to stop Muhammed from making devotions towards Allah, and anyone else for that matter.\nAyahs 11\u201314: These ayahs question whether the \u201cone who discourages\u201d is being \u201cguided\u201d or even \u201cconcerned\u201d about god. They also emphasize that if someone is praying not to stop them because Allah is always watching.\nAyahs 15\u201319: These ayahs explain why the person who interrupts someone in prayer is said that they will be dragged from their \u201clying, sinful, forelock.\u201d This phrase comes from Abu Jahl, who in the battle of Badr was killed by the hands of 2 child orphans of Medinah. His body was thrown into a well and they dragged him by his hair, which is specifically in reference to ayah 15.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n\n{{Sura|96|[[At-Tin]]|[[Al-Qadr]]}}\n[[Category:Chapters in the Quran|Alaq]]\n[[Category:609]]\n", "name_user": "175.107.215.245", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200ePeriod of revelation)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Alaq"}

In 1879, a representative of the [[Order of Scottish Clans]] was received by the local community at a reception in the Hotel Hamilton. However the group, not feeling the organization was acted in their interest, ultimately decided to set up a [[benefit society]] of their own, and on November 22, 1879, the Holyoke Caledonian Benefit Society was organized with a charter member of 21.

The channel launched a preview on December 2, 2011, and {{As of|2020|2|df=|lc=y}}, it has accumulated over 10 million subscribers and 1.2 billion video views.<ref name=CCSBstats>{{cite web|url=https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/crashcourse|title=crashcourse YouTube Stats, Channel Statistics|publisher=[[Social Blade]]|accessdate=August 31, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721142027/https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/crashcourse|archive-date=July 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The channel launched with John and Hank presenting their respective ''World History'' and ''Biology'' series; the early history of the channel continued the trend of John and Hank presenting [[humanities]] and [[science]] courses, respectively.<ref name=Talbot2014>{{cite web|last=Talbot|first=Margaret|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/06/09/the-teen-whisperer|title=The Teen Whisperer|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=June 9, 2014|accessdate=October 20, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019175948/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/06/09/the-teen-whisperer|archive-date=October 19, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> In November 2014, Hank announced a partnership with [[PBS Digital Studios]], which would allow the channel to produce more courses. As a result, multiple additional hosts joined the show to increase the number of concurrent series.\n\nTo date, there are 38 main series of ''Crash Course'', of which John has hosted nine and Hank has hosted seven. Together with [[Emily Graslie]], they also co-hosted ''Big History''. A second channel, ''Crash Course Kids'', is hosted by [[Sabrina Cruz]] and has completed its first series, ''Science''. The first foreign-language course, an [[Arabic]] reworking of the original ''World History'' series, is hosted by Yasser Abumuailek. The main channel has also begun a series of shorter animated episodes, called ''Recess'', that focus on topics from previous ''Crash Course'' series. A collaboration with [[Arizona State University]] titled ''Study Hall'' began in 2020, which includes less structured learning in its topics.\n\n==Series overview==\n===Main series===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

However, throughout all series, the show's host will progressively elaborate on the topic(s) presented at the beginning of the video. Early on in the history of the show, the Green Brothers began to employ an [[educational entertainment|edutainment]] style for episodes of ''Crash Course'', using humor to blend entertainment together with the educational content.<ref name=Grantham2012>{{cite web|last=Grantham|first=Nick|url=http://www.fractuslearning.com/2012/02/29/brothers-history-biology/|title=Meet Two Brothers Who Bring Biology And History To Life|work=Fractus Learning|date=February 29, 2012|accessdate=July 8, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305084943/http://www.fractuslearning.com/2012/02/29/brothers-history-biology/|archive-date=March 5, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe ''World History'' series featured recurring segments such as \"The Open Letter,\" where Green reads an open letter to a historical figure, period, item, or concept. Occasionally he converses with a na\u00efve, younger version of himself whom he calls \"Me from the past\"; this character usually has na\u00efve or obvious questions or statements about the topic of the video.<ref name=Talbot2014/><ref name=Cicconet2013>{{cite web|last=Cicconet|first=Marcelo|url=http://nyunews.com/2013/04/07/cicconet-13/|title=YouTube not just a site for entertainment, but education|work=[[Washington Square News]]|date=April 7, 2013|accessdate=April 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411042332/http://nyunews.com/2013/04/07/cicconet-13/|archive-date=April 11, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> A running joke throughout the series is that the [[Mongols]] are a major exception to most sweeping generalizations in world history. Mentions of this fact cue the \"Mongoltage\" (a portmanteau of \"Mongol\" and \"montage\"), which shows a drawing of Mongols shouting \"We're an Exception!\" followed by a three-second clip of a scene from the 1963 film ''[[Hercules Against the Mongols]]'' depicting a village raid. Green also frequently encouraged his viewers to avoid looking at history through [[Eurocentric]] or \"[[Great man theory|Great Man]]\" lenses, but instead to be conscious of a broader historical context.\n\nFor ''U.S. History'', Green followed the tone set by ''World History'' and put an emphasis on maintaining an open, non-Western view of American History. In addition, the \"Open Letter\" was replaced by a new segment called the \"Mystery Document\", in which Green would take a manuscript from the fireplace's secret compartment and read it aloud, followed by him guessing its author and the source work it is excerpted from. If incorrect, he would punished by a [[Joy buzzer|shock pen]]. While the Mongoltage was largely absent, mentions of America's national pride during the series would cue a new \"Libertage\", which consisted of photos associated with America atop an American flag, with a guitar sound effect and an explosion at the start and end of the montage, respectively.\n\nThe ''Biography'' program featured the recurring segment \"Biolo-graphy,\" during which Hank relayed a short [[biography]] of someone who was associated with the topic of the episode.

However, throughout all series, the show's host will progressively elaborate on the topic(s) presented at the beginning of the video. Early on in the history of the show, the Green Brothers began to employ an [[educational entertainment|edutainment]] style for episodes of ''Crash Course'', using humor to blend entertainment together with the educational content.<ref name=Grantham2012>{{cite web|last=Grantham|first=Nick|url=http://www.fractuslearning.com/2012/02/29/brothers-history-biology/|title=Meet Two Brothers Who Bring Biology And History To Life|work=Fractus Learning|date=February 29, 2012|accessdate=July 8, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305084943/http://www.fractuslearning.com/2012/02/29/brothers-history-biology/|archive-date=March 5, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe ''World History'' series featured recurring segments such as \"The Open Letter,\" where Green reads an open letter to a historical figure, period, item, or concept. Occasionally he converses with a na\u00efve, younger version of himself whom he calls \"Me from the past\"; this character usually has na\u00efve or obvious questions or statements about the topic of the video.<ref name=Talbot2014/><ref name=Cicconet2013>{{cite web|last=Cicconet|first=Marcelo|url=http://nyunews.com/2013/04/07/cicconet-13/|title=YouTube not just a site for entertainment, but education|work=[[Washington Square News]]|date=April 7, 2013|accessdate=April 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411042332/http://nyunews.com/2013/04/07/cicconet-13/|archive-date=April 11, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> A running joke throughout the series is that the [[Mongols]] are a major exception to most sweeping generalizations in world history. Mentions of this fact cue the \"Mongoltage\" (a portmanteau of \"Mongol\" and \"montage\"), which shows a drawing of Mongols shouting \"We're an Exception!\" followed by a three-second clip of a scene from the 1963 film ''[[Hercules Against the Mongols]]'' depicting a village raid. Green also frequently encouraged his viewers to avoid looking at history through [[Eurocentric]] or \"[[Great man theory|Great Man]]\" lenses, but instead to be conscious of a broader historical context.\n\nFor ''U.S. History'', Green followed the tone set by ''World History'' and put an emphasis on maintaining an open, non-Western view of American History. In addition, the \"Open Letter\" was replaced by a new segment called the \"Mystery Document\", in which Green would take a manuscript from the fireplace's secret compartment and read it aloud, followed by him guessing its author and the source work it is excerpted from. If incorrect, he would punished by a [[Joy buzzer|shock pen]]. While the Mongoltage was largely absent, mentions of America's national pride during the series would cue a new \"Libertage\", which consisted of photos associated with America atop an American flag, with a guitar sound effect and an explosion at the start and end of the montage, respectively.\n\nThe ''Biography'' program featured the recurring segment \"Biolo-graphy,\" during which Hank relayed a short [[biography]] of someone who was associated with the topic of the episode. Additionally, at the conclusion of each episode, Hank provided YouTube annotations with links to every subtopic he explained within the video. He also noted that the successor series to ''Biology'', ''Crash Course [[Ecology]]'', would follow in the spirit of the former series.<ref>{{cite AV media|last=Green|first=Hank|title=Ecology - Rules for Living on Earth: Crash Course Biology #40|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izRvPaAWgyw|work=Crash Course|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=October 29, 2012|accessdate=October 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101094007/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izRvPaAWgyw|archive-date=November 1, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nIn an interview with ''[[Entrepreneur (magazine)|Entrepreneur]]'', ''Crash Course'' producer and ''Sociology'' host Nicole Sweeney detailed:\n\n<blockquote>Every year we have a big pitch meeting to determine what courses and things we're going to do the next year.

{"title_page": "First Doctor comic stories", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|{{unreferenced|date=December 2012}}{{notability|date=December 2012}}}}\n\n'''First Doctor comic stories''' refers to the [[List of Doctor Who comic stories|comic strips]] devoted to the long-running British [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', using the likeness of the [[First Doctor]] [[William Hartnell]]. The strip was launched in [[Polystyle Publications|Polystyle's]] ''[[TV Comic]]'' on 14 November 1964, less than a year after the television series began broadcasting and was the first original [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] media from the show.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This strip began what has become known as the '[[Doctor Who Polystyle comic strip|Polystyle era]]': running from 1964 to 1979.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-11\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 11</ref> The First Doctor starred in this strip running parallel with his appearance on the television show, ending in December 1966, after which ''TV Comic'' began creating strips for the [[Second Doctor]]. The franchise to print a regular comic strip passed to ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' (then ''Doctor Who Weekly'') in 1979, and was opened up to multiple franchises in the mid-2000s. During this time, the First Doctor has made various guest appearances as well as starring in some one-off comic strips. \n\n== Polystyle comic strips (1964-1966) ==\n\n=== History ===\n\n''TV Comic'', according to ''Doctor Who'' historian Jeremy Bentham, 'had grown up in the wake of commercial television. Just as publications like ''[[Radio Fun]]'' had blossomed during the golden years of the wireless so ''TV Comic'' began catering for young readerships who watched and liked children's programmes on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]].<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-15\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 15</ref> ''TV Comic'' - despite only having previously featured spin-offs of ITV programmes, decided to pitch for ''Doctor Who'' with the [[BBC]], and despite initial reticence from the channel, eventually struck a deal.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> The strip launched in issue 674 with a cover date of 14 November 1964; hitting the shelves - according to ''Doctor Who'' comics historian Paul Scoones - on 8 November 1964.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This means that the ''Doctor Who'' comic strip in ''TV Comic'' was officially the first spin-off media from the show - the first novelization ''[[The_Daleks#In_print|Doctor Who in an exciting adventure with the Daleks]]'' not being released until later the same week on 12 November.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> One immediate difference from the TV show was that the Doctor would be referred to in-strip as 'Doctor Who'.\n\nThere were other differences too. The rights to use ''Doctor Who'' applied 'then, as now' only applied to the likeness of the actor playing the Doctor and the TARDIS, and the portrayal of any other characters - be they companions or adversaries - would have been a separate negotiation and an increased cost, even prohibitive for companions who would appear in every installment.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> Accordingly, the Doctor was given new companions in the first strip, \"The Klepton Parasites\", two grandchildren Gillian and John. Regarding ''Doctor Who'' foes, the situation was very similar. During the First Doctor period of the ''TV Comic'' strip, only the inhabitants of [[Vortis (Doctor Who)|Vortis]] from \"[[The Web Planet]]\" (1965) - the [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(Q\u2013Z)#Zarbi|Zarbi]] and [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(H\u2013P)#Menoptra|Menoptra]] - made it into a story. The Doctor's greatest adversaries - the [[Dalek|Daleks]] - could not appear for another reason. This was that creator ([[Terry Nation]]) had 'a separate copyright' for the creatures, and had negotiated a deal with ''[[TV Century 21]]'' (aka ''TV21'') comics around the same time for their own strip; and copyright could 'only be held by one company at any one time' for the same format.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-17\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 17</ref> \"[[Dalek_comic_strips,_illustrated_annuals_and_graphic_novels#Comics|The Daleks]]\" strip appeared in issue 1 of ''TV21'' (23 January 1965), and ran for one hundred and four installments, each a page long, ending in issue 104 (14 January 1967).\n\n=== Writers and Artists ===\n\nThere were three artists during the ''TV Comic'' First Doctor period. Neville Main was the first to draw the First Doctor (and thus to draw any incarnation of the Doctor). Main drew the first 9 stories (46 episodes) of the ''TVC'' strip, plus one single episode strip for the 1965 ''TVC Holiday Special'' and two single episode strips for the 1965 ''TVC Annual 1966''. \n\nBentham comments: 'In those days the notion of a strip having a separate writer was strictly the prerogative of American comic books'.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> Bentham describes Main's output thus: very simplistic in style, consisting of basic line illustrations drawn in a very cartoonish way. During his 45 week stint on the strip he never quite captured the likeness of Hartnell [...] He was, however, quite an inventive storywriter.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref>\n\n=== List of comic strips ===\n\nThe list below is of all the First Doctor comic strips that appeared in ''TV Comic'' (''TVC'') as well the yearly ''TV Comic Holiday Special'' (''TVCHS'') and ''TV Comic Annual'' (''TVCA''). The order is that designated by the publication date, as integrated by Paul Scoones.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-7\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 7</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n\n|style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''#'''{{ref label|TVC_a|a|}} ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Title'''{{ref label|TVC_b|b|}} ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Companions''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Featuring''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Pub.''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"| '''Issues''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Ep#''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Date''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"| '''Format''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"| '''Writer''' || style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Artist''' \n|-\n\n| 01 || \"The Klepton Parasites\" || Gillian/John || Kleptons || ''TVC'' ||674 - 683 || 10|| 14 Nov 1964 - 16 Jan 1965  || B&W || ?

The strip was launched in [[Polystyle Publications|Polystyle's]] ''[[TV Comic]]'' on 14 November 1964, less than a year after the television series began broadcasting and was the first original [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] media from the show.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This strip began what has become known as the '[[Doctor Who Polystyle comic strip|Polystyle era]]': running from 1964 to 1979.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-11\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 11</ref> The First Doctor starred in this strip running parallel with his appearance on the television show, ending in December 1966, after which ''TV Comic'' began creating strips for the [[Second Doctor]]. The franchise to print a regular comic strip passed to ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' (then ''Doctor Who Weekly'') in 1979, and was opened up to multiple franchises in the mid-2000s. During this time, the First Doctor has made various guest appearances as well as starring in some one-off comic strips. \n\n== Polystyle comic strips (1964-1966) ==\n\n=== History ===\n\n''TV Comic'', according to ''Doctor Who'' historian Jeremy Bentham, 'had grown up in the wake of commercial television. Just as publications like ''[[Radio Fun]]'' had blossomed during the golden years of the wireless so ''TV Comic'' began catering for young readerships who watched and liked children's programmes on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]].<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-15\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 15</ref> ''TV Comic'' - despite only having previously featured spin-offs of ITV programmes, decided to pitch for ''Doctor Who'' with the [[BBC]], and despite initial reticence from the channel, eventually struck a deal.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> The strip launched in issue 674 with a cover date of 14 November 1964; hitting the shelves - according to ''Doctor Who'' comics historian Paul Scoones - on 8 November 1964.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This means that the ''Doctor Who'' comic strip in ''TV Comic'' was officially the first spin-off media from the show - the first novelization ''[[The_Daleks#In_print|Doctor Who in an exciting adventure with the Daleks]]'' not being released until later the same week on 12 November.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> One immediate difference from the TV show was that the Doctor would be referred to in-strip as 'Doctor Who'.\n\nThere were other differences too. The rights to use ''Doctor Who'' applied 'then, as now' only applied to the likeness of the actor playing the Doctor and the TARDIS, and the portrayal of any other characters - be they companions or adversaries - would have been a separate negotiation and an increased cost, even prohibitive for companions who would appear in every installment.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> Accordingly, the Doctor was given new companions in the first strip, \"The Klepton Parasites\", two grandchildren Gillian and John. Regarding ''Doctor Who'' foes, the situation was very similar. During the First Doctor period of the ''TV Comic'' strip, only the inhabitants of [[Vortis (Doctor Who)|Vortis]] from \"[[The Web Planet]]\" (1965) - the [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(Q\u2013Z)#Zarbi|Zarbi]] and [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(H\u2013P)#Menoptra|Menoptra]] - made it into a story. The Doctor's greatest adversaries - the [[Dalek|Daleks]] - could not appear for another reason. This was that creator ([[Terry Nation]]) had 'a separate copyright' for the creatures, and had negotiated a deal with ''[[TV Century 21]]'' (aka ''TV21'') comics around the same time for their own strip; and copyright could 'only be held by one company at any one time' for the same format.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-17\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 17</ref> \"[[Dalek_comic_strips,_illustrated_annuals_and_graphic_novels#Comics|The Daleks]]\" strip appeared in issue 1 of ''TV21'' (23 January 1965), and ran for one hundred and four installments, each a page long, ending in issue 104 (14 January 1967).\n\n=== Writers and Artists ===\n\nThe first artist to draw the First Doctor (and thus to draw any incarnation of the Doctor) for ''TV Comic'' was Neville Main. And Main also wrote the stories - so is also the first writer to publish a non-TV based ''Doctor Who'' story. Bentham comments: 'In those days the notion of a strip having a separate writer was strictly the prerogative of American comic books'.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> Bentham describes Main's output thus: very simplistic in style, consisting of basic line illustrations drawn in a very cartoonish way. During his 45 week stint on the strip he never quite captured the likeness of Hartnell [...] He was, however, quite an inventive storywriter.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref>\n\n=== List of comic strips ===\n\nThe list below is of all the First Doctor comic strips that appeared in ''TV Comic'' (''TVC'') as well the yearly ''TV Comic Holiday Special'' (''TVCHS'') and ''TV Comic Annual'' (''TVCA''). The order is that designated by the publication date, as integrated by Paul Scoones.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-7\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 7</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n\n|style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''#'''{{ref label|TVC_a|a|}} ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Title'''{{ref label|TVC_b|b|}} ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Companions''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Featuring''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Pub.''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"| '''Issues''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Ep#''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Date''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"| '''Format''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"| '''Writer''' || style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Artist''' \n|-\n\n| 01 || \"The Klepton Parasites\" || Gillian/John || Kleptons || ''TVC'' ||674 - 683 || 10|| 14 Nov 1964 - 16 Jan 1965  || B&W || ?

The incumbent governor of the province is [[Saud bin Nayef Al Saud|Prince Saud bin Nayef Al Saud]]. Other populous cities in the province include [[Hofuf]], Mubarraz, [[Hafar Al-Batin|Hafr al-Batin]], [[Jubail]] and [[Khobar]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/saudi-arabia-population/cities/|website=worldpopulationreview.com|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>. The region is extremely popular among tourists for its beaches on the [[Persian Gulf]] and proximity to the other countries of the eastern [[Arab world]], such as the [[UAE|United Arab Emirates]] and [[Bahrain]], with the latter being linked to the province via the 25 km (15 mi) long [[King Fahd Causeway]]. The region also shares a border with [[Oman]]. The province is bordered to the west, from north to south, by the provinces of the [[Northern Borders Region|Northern Borders]], [[Ha'il Region|Ha'il]], [[Al-Qassim Region|Qassim]], [[Riyadh Region|Riyadh]] and [[Najran Region|Najran]].\n\nThe Eastern Province encompasses the entire east coast of Saudi Arabia and acts as a major platform for most of the kingdom's oil production and exports. [[Petroleum|Oil]] was first found in the country in the Eastern Province, at the Prosperity Well site (formerly known as Dammam No.7). The [[Ghawar Field|Ghawar oil field]], located in the [[Al-Ahsa Governorate|Ahsa Governorate]], measuring 8400 sq.km. (3240 sq.mi.) is the largest oil field in the world<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hydrocarbons-technology.com/projects/ghawar-oil-field/|title=Ghawar Oil Field|website=Hydrocarbons Technology|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>, and accounts for roughly a third of the kingdom's oil production. The [[Safaniya Oil Field|Safaniya oil field]], located off the coast of the province, is the largest [[offshore oil field]] in the world. The Jubail Industrial City, part of the city of [[Jubail]], the fifth most populous in the province, is the largest industrial city in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/world-s-largest-industrial-areas.html|title=The World's Largest Industrial Areas|website=WorldAtlas|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> \n\nThe area was largely uninhabited until the [[Iron Age]], when a few people migrated over from the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] and [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] empires. For most of the early medieval period, the region was under [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] rule until the advent of Islam under [[Muhammad]], and subsequently, the [[Islamic empires]] during the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. After a brief period of [[British Empire|British]] rule during the early modern period, the [[Unification of Saudi Arabia]] led to the consolidation of the region into the [[Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd]], which in 1932, was united into the modern [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Rub al Khali 002.JPG|thumb|248x248px|The [[Rub' al Khali|Rub' al-Khali]] or Empty Quarter, comprises more than a third of the Eastern Province]]\nApproximately two-thirds of the province is desert, comprising of, from south to north, the [[Rub' al Khali]], [[Ad-Dahna Desert|Dahna]] and [[An Nafud|Nafud]] deserts, with the Rub' al-Khali alone comprising more than half of the area of the province. Areas such as [[Hafar Al-Batin|Hafr al-Batin]] and the [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Ahsa Oasis]] have become important sites for [[desert farming]] due to the advancements made during the [[Green Revolution]] in farming and irrigation techniques. \n\nThe entire eastern coast of the kingdom lies in the Eastern Province. The region borders, from north to south, the countries of [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain|Bahrain,]] [[Qatar]], [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Oman]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mohammad adil-Rashidun empire-slide.gif|thumb|335x335px|The [[Rashidun Caliphate]] expanded the Muslim world into three continents within 20 years of the death of [[Muhammad]]]]The northern part of the Eastern Province was first inhabited by the [[Lakhmids]] around 300 AD, with the coastal regions claimed by the [[Sasanians]] but governed by the Lakhmids.

The region stayed stable during the first three Islamic caliphates. \n[[File:IbnSaud.jpg|thumb|[[King of Saudi Arabia|King]] [[Ibn Saud]] is largely accepted to be the founder of present-day [[Saudi Arabia]], also known as the Third Saudi State]]During the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], the region was taken over by the [[Qarmatians]], a [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] group of the [[Isma'ilism|Isma'ili]] branch, around 899 AD. The Qarmatians attacked [[Makkah]] and [[Madinah]] and held the [[Black Stone]] to ransom in Ahsa in 920 AD. The region was ruled by the Qaramatians until 976 AD, when after losing to the Abbasids, they were reduced to the status of a local power. After Bahrain and Qatif seceded from Qarmatian rule around 1058 AD, they retreated to the [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Ahsa Oasis]], to which [[Abdullah bin Ali Al Uyuni]] laid siege and invaded in 1076 AD, ending the rule of Qarmatians in Ahsa and founding the [[Uyunid Emirate]]<ref name=\":4\" />.\n\nNot much is known of the Uyunids, except that they were the descendants of the [[Banu Abdul Qays]] tribe. They were involved in several internal disputes, causing the emirate to become unstable and eventually leading to the rise of the Bedouin Usfurids. The Usfurids saw a short period of stability. After overthrowing their former allies, the Uyunids, they had an uneasy relationship with the Persian rulers of Hormuz, who took control of the former Uyunid cities of Qatif and Bahrain around 1320 AD. This eventually led to the fall of the Usfurids. The region was mostly overlooked until the 1500s, when the [[Jabrids]] took over around 1507 AD, but they too fell due to internal conflicts in or around the 1540s<ref name=\":4\" />.\n\nIn 1551 AD, the Ottomans invaded the region during their [[Ottoman-Safavid War (1532-1555)|first war with the Safavids]], and kept it under their control until 1671<ref name=\":4\" />. After several years of unrest between the Ottomans, Saudis and Rashidis, the [[Emirate of Nejd and Hasa]], also known as the Third Saudi State, under [[Ibn Saud]], liberated the entire [[Arabian Peninsula]] from Ottoman and [[Emirate of Jabal Shammar|Rashidi]] control. Most of the Eastern Province came under the Hasa region, and as such, the emirate has been under Saudi control since 1902.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2015}}According to the Population Characteristics Surveys conducted by the General Authority of Statistics, the Eastern Province had a population of 4,900,325 as of December 2017<ref name=\":0\" />, of which 3,140,362 were Saudis and 1,759,963 were foreign nationals. The Eastern Province is the third most populous province in Saudi Arabia, after Makkah and Riyadh. With an estimated population of 1,225,000 as of 2019<ref name=\":1\" />, Dammam is the most populous city in the province and the sixth most populous city in the country.

The region is extremely popular among tourists for its beaches on the [[Persian Gulf]] and proximity to the other countries of the eastern [[Arab world]], such as the [[UAE|United Arab Emirates]] and [[Bahrain]], with the latter being linked to the province via the 25 km (15 mi) long [[King Fahd Causeway]]. The region also shares a border with [[Oman]]. The province is bordered to the west, from north to south, by the provinces of the [[Northern Borders Region|Northern Borders]], [[Ha'il Region|Ha'il]], [[Al-Qassim Region|Qassim]], [[Riyadh Region|Riyadh]] and [[Najran Region|Najran]].\n\nThe Eastern Province encompasses the entire east coast of Saudi Arabia and acts as a major platform for most of the kingdom's oil production and exports. [[Petroleum|Oil]] was first found in the country in the Eastern Province, at the Prosperity Well site (formerly known as Dammam No.7). The [[Ghawar Field|Ghawar oil field]], located in the [[Al-Ahsa Governorate|Ahsa Governorate]], measuring 8400 sq.km. (3240 sq.mi.) is the largest oil field in the world, and accounts for roughly a third of the kingdom's oil production. The [[Safaniya Oil Field|Safaniya oil field]], located off the coast of the province, is the largest [[offshore oil field]] in the world. The Jubail Industrial City, part of the city of [[Jubail]], the fifth most populous in the province, is the largest industrial city in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/world-s-largest-industrial-areas.html|title=The World's Largest Industrial Areas|website=WorldAtlas|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> \n\nThe area was largely uninhabited until the [[Iron Age]], when a few people migrated over from the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] and [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] empires. For most of the early medieval period, the region was under [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] rule until the advent of Islam under [[Muhammad]], and subsequently, the [[Islamic empires]] during the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. After a brief period of [[British Empire|British]] rule during the early modern period, the [[Unification of Saudi Arabia]] led to the consolidation of the region into the [[Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd]], which in 1932, was united into the modern [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Rub al Khali 002.JPG|thumb|248x248px|The [[Rub' al Khali|Rub' al-Khali]] or Empty Quarter, comprises more than a third of the Eastern Province]]\nApproximately two-thirds of the province is desert, comprising of, from south to north, the [[Rub' al Khali]], [[Ad-Dahna Desert|Dahna]] and [[An Nafud|Nafud]] deserts, with the Rub' al-Khali alone comprising more than half of the area of the province. Areas such as [[Hafar Al-Batin|Hafr al-Batin]] and the [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Ahsa Oasis]] have become important sites for [[desert farming]] due to the advancements made during the [[Green Revolution]] in farming and irrigation techniques. \n\nThe entire eastern coast of the kingdom lies in the Eastern Province.

The Qarmatians attacked [[Makkah]] and [[Madinah]] and held the [[Black Stone]] to ransom in Ahsa in 920 AD. The region was ruled by the Qaramatians until 976 AD, when after losing to the Abbasids, they were reduced to the status of a local power. After Bahrain and Qatif seceded from Qarmatian rule around 1058 AD, they retreated to the [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Ahsa Oasis]], to which [[Abdullah bin Ali Al Uyuni]] laid siege and invaded in 1076 AD, ending the rule of Qarmatians in Ahsa and founding the [[Uyunid Emirate]]<ref name=\":4\" />. \n\n=== Uyunids, Usfurids and Jabrids (1076-1521 AD) ===\nNot much is known of the Uyunids, except that they were the descendants of the [[Banu Abdul Qays]] tribe.

After overthrowing their former allies, the Uyunids, they had an uneasy relationship with the Persian rulers of Hormuz, who took control of the former Uyunid cities of Qatif and Bahrain around 1320 AD. This eventually led to the fall of the Usfurids.

It stars [[Ansel Elgort]] as a young, musically driven [[getaway driver]] seeking freedom from a life of crime with his lover Debora ([[Lily James]]). [[Kevin Spacey]], [[Jon Hamm]], [[Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez]], [[Jamie Foxx]] and [[Jon Bernthal]] (among others) appear in supporting roles. [[Eric Fellner]] and his [[Working Title Films]] partner [[Tim Bevan]] produced ''Baby Driver'' in association with [[Big Talk Productions]]' [[Nira Park]]. [[Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group#Sony Pictures Releasing|Sony]] and [[TriStar Pictures]] handled commercial distribution of the film. ''Baby Driver'' was financed through a partnership between TriStar and [[Media Rights Capital]].\n\nThe film is a longtime passion project Wright had developed for over two decades. He devised the idea well in his youth, and his early directing experience furthermore shaped his ambitions for ''Baby Driver''. Originally based in [[Los Angeles]], Wright later revised the film's setting to [[Atlanta]], integrating the city's ethos into an important storytelling device. [[Principal photography]] took place in Atlanta over four months, from February to May 2016. Production involved the planning of meticulously coordinated stunts, choreography, and [[in-camera editing|in-camera]] shooting. Critics have examined ''Baby Driver''{{'s}} subject matter in thematic studies of the film, with emphasis on its use of [[color symbolism]] and focus on Baby's evolving morality.\n\n''Baby Driver'' premiered at the [[South by Southwest]] festival on March 11, 2017, and was released in theaters in North America and the United Kingdom on June 28. It was well received by the media for its craftsmanship, though the characterization and scriptwriting drew occasional criticism. The [[National Board of Review]] selected ''Baby Driver'' as one of the top films of the year. It earned $226 million globally, bolstered by positive word-of-mouth support and fatiguing interest in [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] franchises. ''Baby Driver'' was a candidate for numerous awards, including three [[Academy Awards]] (for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]]), two [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]]s, two [[Critics' Choice Awards]], and a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] (Elgort), and won several other honors chiefly for technical achievement. The success of ''Baby Driver'' has increased studio interest in producing a sequel.\n\n==Plot==\nBaby is a getaway driver in [[Atlanta]]. As a child, he survived a car crash that killed his parents and left him with [[tinnitus]], and finds catharsis in music. Baby ferries crews of robbers assembled by Doc, a criminal mastermind, to pay off a debt Baby incurred when unknowingly stealing a car containing Doc's stolen goods. Between jobs, he remixes snippets of recorded conversations and cares for his deaf foster father Joseph. At Bo's Diner, he meets a [[Waiting staff|waitress]] named Debora, and they start dating.\n\nBaby's next robbery goes awry after an armed bystander chases them down, but Baby evades him and the police. Having paid his debt, Baby quits his life of crime and starts delivering pizzas. Doc interrupts Baby's date with Debora and insists he join a post-office heist, threatening to hurt Debora and Joseph should he refuse.\n\nThe crew consists of easygoing Buddy, his sharpshooter wife Darling, and trigger-happy Bats, who takes an immediate dislike to Baby. When the crew attempts to purchase illegal firearms, Bats recognizes one of the dealers as an undercover cop and opens fire. They kill most of the dealers. Afterward, Bats makes Baby stop at Debora's diner, unaware of Baby and Debora's romance. Baby, aware of Bats' homicidal habit, stops him from killing her to avoid paying.\n\nDoc is furious, revealing that the dealers were [[dirty cops]] on his payroll. He decides to cancel the heist, but Bats, Buddy and Darling disagree. Doc lets Baby decide; he chooses to go through with it. Baby attempts to slip away late that night, hoping to take Debora and leave Atlanta. He is stopped by Buddy and Bats, who have discovered his recordings and believe he is an informant; when they and Doc hear his mixtapes, they are convinced of his innocence.\n\nDuring the heist, Bats kills a security guard. Disgusted, Baby refuses to drive away, causing Bats to hit him. Baby rams the car into a [[rebar]] which impales Bats, killing him. The remaining three flee on foot. After the police kill Darling in a shootout, Buddy blames Baby for her death and vows to kill him. Baby steals a car and flees to his apartment. After leaving Joseph at an assisted living home with his heist earnings, Baby rushes to Bo's for Debora, where Buddy is waiting. Baby shoots Buddy and flees with Debora as police reinforcements swarm the restaurant.\n\nAt the safe house, Doc refuses Baby's pleas for help, but relents when he sees Debora consoling him. Doc supplies them with cash and an escape route out of the country. The police confront the three in the parking garage, but Doc kills them all. Buddy ambushes them and kills Doc. A cat-and-mouse game ensues until Buddy has Baby at his mercy. He fires next to both of Baby's ears, bursting his ear-drums and temporarily deafening him, but the distraction allows Debora to hit Buddy with a crowbar. After Baby shoots him in the leg, Buddy falls to his death.\n\nBaby surrenders after he and Debora encounter a police roadblock. At Baby's trial, Joseph, Debora, and other people affected by Baby's crimes testify in his defense. He is sentenced to 25 years in prison, subject to a parole hearing after five years. Debora stays in contact with Baby during his incarceration, and she waits for him with a newly-purchased vintage car when they are reunited.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n | align        = right\n | direction    = horizontal\n | footer       = Ansel Elgort (left) and Lily James (right) at the ''Baby Driver'' Sydney premiere\n | footer_align = left\n | image1       = Ansel Elgort (35875410045) (colour edited).jpg\n | alt1         = A head-and-shoulder shot of Ansel Elgort at the ''Baby Driver'' Sydney premiere\n | width1       = 150\n | image2       = Lilly James (35036323024).jpg\n | alt2         = A head-and-shoulder shot of Lily James at the ''Baby Driver'' Sydney premiere\n | width2       = 150\n}}\n* [[Ansel Elgort]] as Miles AKA \"Baby\":\n:Baby is the on-call criminal [[getaway driver]] with an intense passion for music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/baby-driver-character-descriptions-jon-bernthal-edgar-wright/|title='Baby Driver' Character Descriptions Revealed; Jon Bernthal Joins Edgar Wright's New Film|first=Matt|last=Goldberg|date=February 23, 2016|publisher=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|language=en-US|access-date=January 15, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170311133204/http://collider.com/baby-driver-character-descriptions-jon-bernthal-edgar-wright/|archivedate=March 11, 2017}}</ref> Elgort regarded the character as an innocent \"younger than his years, deep down\".<ref name=variety>{{cite news | title = Ansel Elgort on \u2018Baby Driver,\u2019 Directing Ambitions and Life Under Trump | date = June 22, 2017 | first = Brent | last = Lang | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | publisher =  | url = https://variety.com/2017/film/news/ansel-elgort-baby-driver-donald-trump-1202470955/ | accessdate = October 6, 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181207103026/https://variety.com/2017/film/news/ansel-elgort-baby-driver-donald-trump-1202470955/ | archive-date = December 7, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> [[Edgar Wright]] and the producers at [[Working Title Films]] began contemplating the lead role well before they obtained funding for ''Baby Driver''.

With [[Media Composer|Avid Media Composer]], Machliss was tasked with syncopating each animatic to the corresponding soundtrack. He and Wright had an existing professional relationship from ''Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'' and ''The World's End''.

Once filmed, DNEG supplemented the live-action shots with projectile bullets, sparks, and gunfire flashes, while bearing in mind the imposing drum riffs of the soundtrack.<ref name=dneg/> The team found that compositing shots to audio, although suitable for live-action projects, presented unique challenges such as how to convey emotional cues to the viewer.<ref name=dneg/>\n\nFor \"Brighton Rock\", the climactic sequence of ''Baby Driver'', DNEG enhanced footage with computer-generated shots for safety and damage control. First, to portray characters being pummeled by cars, the team filmed the accidents in stages. The footage was then composited into complete shots, lending a sense of realism and control.<ref name=dneg/> The shot of Buddy's stolen police car falling in the parking garage atrium from the top level required setting up a shorter, safer drop at another side of the garage with a crane, to comply with the owner's demands.

The intensity of Baby's tinnitus in the audio mix depended on his mood; for example, the more anxious he is, the louder the ringing.<ref name=indiesound/> Managing tempo changes with the sound effects proved troublesome.

It stars [[Ansel Elgort]] as a young, musically driven [[getaway driver]] seeking freedom from a life of crime with his lover Debora ([[Lily James]]). [[Kevin Spacey]], [[Jon Hamm]], [[Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez]], [[Jamie Foxx]] and [[Jon Bernthal]] (among others) appear in supporting roles. [[Eric Fellner]] and his [[Working Title Films]] partner [[Tim Bevan]] produced ''Baby Driver'' in association with [[Big Talk Productions]]' [[Nira Park]]. [[Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group#Sony Pictures Releasing|Sony]] and [[TriStar Pictures]] handled commercial distribution of the film. ''Baby Driver'' was financed through a partnership between TriStar and [[Media Rights Capital]].\n\nThe film is a longtime passion project Wright had developed for over two decades. He devised the idea well in his youth, and his early directing experience furthermore shaped his ambitions for ''Baby Driver''. Originally based in [[Los Angeles]], Wright later revised the film's setting to [[Atlanta]], integrating the city's ethos into an important storytelling device. [[Principal photography]] took place in Atlanta over four months, from February to May 2016. Production involved the planning of meticulously coordinated stunts, choreography, and [[in-camera editing|in-camera]] shooting. Critics have examined ''Baby Driver''{{'s}} subject matter in thematic studies of the film, with emphasis on its use of [[color symbolism]] and focus on Baby's evolving morality.\n\n''Baby Driver'' premiered at the [[South by Southwest]] festival on March 11, 2017, and was released in theaters in North America and the United Kingdom on June 28. It was well received by the media for its craftsmanship, though the characterization and scriptwriting drew occasional criticism. The [[National Board of Review]] selected ''Baby Driver'' as one of the top films of the year. It earned $226 million globally, bolstered by positive word-of-mouth support and fatiguing interest in [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] franchises. ''Baby Driver'' was a candidate for numerous awards, including three [[Academy Awards]] (for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]]), two [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]]s, two [[Critics' Choice Awards]], and a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] (Elgort), and won several other honors chiefly for technical achievement. The success of ''Baby Driver'' has increased studio interest in producing a sequel.\n\n==Plot==\nBaby is a getaway driver in [[Atlanta]]. As a child, he survived a car crash that killed his parents and left him with [[tinnitus]], and finds catharsis in music. Baby ferries crews of robbers assembled by Doc, a criminal mastermind, to pay off a debt Baby incurred when unknowingly stealing a car containing Doc's stolen goods. Between jobs, he remixes snippets of recorded conversations and cares for his deaf foster father Joseph. At Bo's Diner, he meets a [[Waiting staff|waitress]] named Debora, and they start dating.\n\nBaby's next robbery goes awry after an armed bystander chases them down, but Baby evades him and the police. Having paid his debt, Baby quits his life of crime and starts delivering pizzas. Doc interrupts Baby's date with Debora and insists he join a post-office heist, threatening to hurt Debora and Joseph should he refuse.\n\nThe crew consists of easygoing Buddy, his sharpshooter wife Darling, and trigger-happy Bats, who takes an immediate dislike to Baby. When the crew attempts to purchase illegal firearms, Bats recognizes one of the dealers as an undercover cop and opens fire. They kill most of the dealers. Afterward, Bats makes Baby stop at Debora's diner, unaware of Baby and Debora's romance. Baby, aware of Bats' homicidal habit, stops him from killing her to avoid paying.\n\nDoc is furious, revealing that the dealers were [[dirty cops]] on his payroll. He decides to cancel the heist, but Bats, Buddy and Darling disagree. Doc lets Baby decide; he chooses to go through with it. Baby attempts to slip away late that night, hoping to take Debora and leave Atlanta. He is stopped by Buddy and Bats, who have discovered his recordings and believe he is an informant; when they and Doc hear his mixtapes, they are convinced of his innocence.\n\nDuring the heist, Bats kills a security guard. Disgusted, Baby refuses to drive away, causing Bats to hit him. Baby rams the car into a [[rebar]] which impales Bats, killing him. The remaining three flee on foot. After the police kill Darling in a shootout, Buddy blames Baby for her death and vows to kill him. Baby steals a car and flees to his apartment. After leaving Joseph at an assisted living home with his heist earnings, Baby rushes to Bo's for Debora, where Buddy is waiting. Baby shoots Buddy and flees with Debora as police reinforcements swarm the restaurant.\n\nAt the safe house, Doc refuses Baby's pleas for help, but relents when he sees Debora consoling him. Doc supplies them with cash and an escape route out of the country. The police confront the three in the parking garage, but Doc kills them all. Buddy ambushes them and kills Doc. A cat-and-mouse game ensues until Buddy has Baby at his mercy. He fires next to both of Baby's ears, bursting his ear-drums and temporarily deafening him, but the distraction allows Debora to hit Buddy with a crowbar. After Baby shoots him in the leg, Buddy falls to his death.\n\nBaby surrenders after he and Debora encounter a police roadblock. At Baby's trial, Joseph, Debora, and other people affected by Baby's crimes testify in his defense. He is sentenced to 25 years in prison, subject to a parole hearing after five years. Debora stays in contact with Baby during his incarceration, and she waits for him with a newly-purchased vintage car when they are reunited.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n | align        = right\n | direction    = horizontal\n | footer       = Ansel Elgort (left) and Lily James (right) at the ''Baby Driver'' Sydney premiere\n | footer_align = left\n | image1       = Ansel Elgort (35875410045) (colour edited).jpg\n | alt1         = A head-and-shoulder shot of Ansel Elgort at the ''Baby Driver'' Sydney premiere\n | width1       = 150\n | image2       = Lilly James (35036323024).jpg\n | alt2         = A head-and-shoulder shot of Lily James at the ''Baby Driver'' Sydney premiere\n | width2       = 150\n}}\n* [[Ansel Elgort]] as Miles AKA \"Baby\":\n:Baby is the on-call criminal [[getaway driver]] with an intense passion for music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/baby-driver-character-descriptions-jon-bernthal-edgar-wright/|title='Baby Driver' Character Descriptions Revealed; Jon Bernthal Joins Edgar Wright's New Film|first=Matt|last=Goldberg|date=February 23, 2016|publisher=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|language=en-US|access-date=January 15, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170311133204/http://collider.com/baby-driver-character-descriptions-jon-bernthal-edgar-wright/|archivedate=March 11, 2017}}</ref> Elgort regarded the character as an innocent \"younger than his years, deep down\".<ref name=variety>{{cite news | title = Ansel Elgort on \u2018Baby Driver,\u2019 Directing Ambitions and Life Under Trump | date = June 22, 2017 | first = Brent | last = Lang | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | publisher =  | url = https://variety.com/2017/film/news/ansel-elgort-baby-driver-donald-trump-1202470955/ | accessdate = October 6, 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181207103026/https://variety.com/2017/film/news/ansel-elgort-baby-driver-donald-trump-1202470955/ | archive-date = December 7, 2018 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref> [[Edgar Wright]] and the producers at [[Working Title Films]] began contemplating the lead role well before they obtained funding for ''Baby Driver''.

He had relocated to London to finish his first professional film, the low-budget western comedy ''[[A Fistful of Fingers]]'', and to contemplate his future in entertainment.<ref name=Entcast/> Wright's repeated listening to ''[[Orange (Jon Spencer Blues Explosion album)|Orange]]'' (1994), the fourth studio album by the [[Jon Spencer Blues Explosion]], provided the impetus for ''Baby Driver''.<ref name=Entcast/> At first he envisioned a high-speed car chase, which then evolved into a full sequence where the getaway driver dances to \"Bellbottoms\" in his car before the ensuing chase.<ref name=nypostbd/> Though this was ultimately written into the script as the film's opening sequence, Wright's nascent vision was far from a fully realized project.<ref

catalyst not only for its artistic direction, but for signaling the start of a long-term working relationship between Wright and Working Title producers, who would assist with ''Baby Driver''{{'}}s development.<ref name=Entcast/> By 2007, after signing a multi-picture deal with Working Title, and with a clearer vision of the project, the writer-director met with [[Steven Price (composer)|Steven

the film stalled as Wright's other projects\u2014''[[The World's End (film)|The World's End]]'' (2013) and the then-forthcoming ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' (2015), for which he had already prepared a script with [[Joe Cornish]]\u2014took precedence.<ref name=Entcast/> Work resumed immediately after Wright's departure from ''Ant-Man'', when the studio began assembling their roster of actors and

work.<ref name=bdrt/>\n\nWright, lead film editor [[Paul Machliss]], and Los Angeles-based editor Evan Shiff devised a pre-edit of ''Baby Driver'' with [[animatic]]s in the initial stages of production. With [[Media Composer|Avid Media Composer]], Machliss was tasked with syncopating each animatic to the corresponding soundtrack. He and Wright had an existing professional relationship from ''Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'' and ''The World's End''.

Once filmed, DNEG supplemented the live-action shots with projectile bullets, sparks, and gunfire flashes, while bearing in mind the imposing drum riffs of the soundtrack.<ref name=dneg/> The team found that compositing shots to audio, although suitable for live-action projects, presented unique challenges such as how to convey emotional cues to the viewer.<ref name=dneg/>\n\nFor \"Brighton Rock\", the climactic sequence of ''Baby Driver'', DNEG enhanced footage with computer-generated shots for safety and damage control.
