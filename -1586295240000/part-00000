The institute consists of three service divisions: the academics, its [[Teaching hospital|teaching hospital]] (De La Salle University Medical Center), and a [[Research institute|research center]] (Angelo King Medical Research Center).\n\n==History==\n\nThe De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute was started by a group of doctors from the College of Medicine of the [[University of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine General Hospital]] who, in 1976, decided to establish a [[medical school]] to support the need for a well-trained staff for the newly inaugurated Medical Center Manila. Following the national government's policy of dispersing educational facilities outside the [[capital city]] and encouraging the establishment of medical schools in various regions of the country, they decided to establish a medical school in Dasmari\u00f1as City, Cavite. Originally named Emilio Aguinaldo College of Medicine, the school opened in 1979 under the management of the University Physician\u2019s Foundation, Inc. with the Jose P. Rizal National Medical Research Center as its initial [[teaching hospital]]. Then on July 31, 1982, the Foundation inaugurated a 4-storey 180-bed teaching hospital, the University Medical Center.\n\nIn June 1987, ownership and management were acquired by the De La Salle University Inc. In 1992, the college was renamed the De La Salle University College of Medicine and the hospital, the De La Salle University Medical Center. In June 1994, the management of the College of [[Physical Therapy]] which was then part of DLSU-Aguinaldo (now [[De La Salle University - Dasmari\u00f1as|DLSU-D]]) was turned over to the De La Salle University College of Medicine. By June 1995, the complex consisting of the College of Medicine, University Medical Center, College of Physical Therapy, and Research Services was named De La Salle University \u2013 Health Sciences Campus or DLSU-HSC under the ownership and administration of the St. Bro. Miguel Febres Cordero Medical Education Foundation.\n\nIn May 2000, the colleges under the administration of the DLSU-Health Sciences Campus increased with the transfer of the Colleges of [[Radiographer|Medical Radiation Technology]] and [[Nursing]] & [[Midwifery]] (formerly under DLSU-D). Eventually, the institution\u2019s name became De La Salle Health Sciences Institute upon approval of the Board of Trustees in September 2007.\n\nIn January 2018, the term \u201cMedical\u201d was included in the institution's name as granted by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.dlshsi.edu.ph/de-la-salle-medical-health-sciences-institute/history |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, DLSMHSI became an official member of the [[ASEAN University Network]]-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) as confirmed by Banjong Ujjin, the Senior Programme Officer of the AUN Secretariat Team.<ref>{{cite web |title=AUN-QA ASSOCIATE MEMBERS |url=http://aun-qa.org/associate/current#4 |website=ASEAN University Network-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) |accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn October 25, 2019, the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] (CHED), granted autonomous status to DLSMHSI through the CHED Memorandum Order No. 12, series of 2019. This means that the institution can enjoy a lot of benefits including being allowed to launch new courses/programs in the undergraduate and/or graduate levels including doctoral programs in areas of expertise without securing a permit/authority from CHED; only informing them of the programs to be offered.<ref>{{cite web |title=CMO No. 12, Series of 2019 \u2013 Grant of Autonomous and Deregulated Status to Private HEIs |url=https://ched.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/CMO-No-12-s-2019-Grant-of-Autonomous-and-Deregulated-Status-to-Private-HEIs.pdf |website=Commission on Higher Education |accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n===Programs and Accreditations===\nDLSMHSI offers academic programs through its seven colleges and a special health sciences senior high school.

The institute consists of three service divisions: the academics, its [[Teaching hospital|teaching hospital]] (De La Salle University Medical Center), and a [[Research institute|research center]] (Angelo King Medical Research Center).\n\n==History==\n\nThe De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute was started by a group of doctors from the College of Medicine of the [[University of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine General Hospital]] who, in 1976, decided to establish a [[medical school]] to support the need for a well-trained staff for the newly inaugurated Medical Center Manila. Following the national government's policy of dispersing educational facilities outside the [[capital city]] and encouraging the establishment of medical schools in various regions of the country, they decided to establish a medical school in Dasmari\u00f1as City, Cavite. Originally named Emilio Aguinaldo College of Medicine, the school opened in 1979 under the management of the University Physician\u2019s Foundation, Inc. with the Jose P. Rizal National Medical Research Center as its initial [[teaching hospital]]. Then on July 31, 1982, the Foundation inaugurated a 4-storey 180-bed teaching hospital, the University Medical Center.\n\nIn June 1987, ownership and management were acquired by the De La Salle University Inc. In 1992, the college was renamed the De La Salle University College of Medicine and the hospital, the De La Salle University Medical Center. In June 1994, the management of the College of [[Physical Therapy]] which was then part of DLSU-Aguinaldo (now [[De La Salle University - Dasmari\u00f1as|DLSU-D]]) was turned over to the De La Salle University College of Medicine. By June 1995, the complex consisting of the College of Medicine, University Medical Center, College of Physical Therapy, and Research Services was named De La Salle University \u2013 Health Sciences Campus or DLSU-HSC under the ownership and administration of the St. Bro. Miguel Febres Cordero Medical Education Foundation.\n\nIn May 2000, the colleges under the administration of the DLSU-Health Sciences Campus increased with the transfer of the Colleges of [[Radiographer|Medical Radiation Technology]] and [[Nursing]] & [[Midwifery]] (formerly under DLSU-D). Eventually, the institution\u2019s name became De La Salle Health Sciences Institute upon approval of the Board of Trustees in September 2007.\n\nIn January 2018, the term \u201cMedical\u201d was included in the institution's name as granted by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.dlshsi.edu.ph/de-la-salle-medical-health-sciences-institute/history |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, DLSMHSI became an official member of the [[ASEAN University Network]]-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) as confirmed by Banjong Ujjin, the Senior Programme Officer of the AUN Secretariat Team.<ref>{{cite web |title=AUN-QA ASSOCIATE MEMBERS |url=http://aun-qa.org/associate/current#4 |website=ASEAN University Network-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) |accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn October 25, 2019, the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] (CHED), granted autonomous status to DLSMHSI through the CHED Memorandum Order No. 12, series of 2019. This means that the institution can enjoy a lot of benefits including being allowed to launch new courses/programs in the undergraduate and/or graduate levels including doctoral programs in areas of expertise without securing a permit/authority from CHED; only informing them of the programs to be offered.<ref>{{cite web |title=CMO No. 12, Series of 2019 \u2013 Grant of Autonomous and Deregulated Status to Private HEIs |url=https://ched.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/CMO-No-12-s-2019-Grant-of-Autonomous-and-Deregulated-Status-to-Private-HEIs.pdf |website=Commission on Higher Education |accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n===Programs and Accreditations===\nDLSMHSI offers academic programs through its seven colleges and a special health sciences senior high school.

Machine Learning, 81:121\u2013148, 2010</ref>\n\n===Taxonomy of potential attacks against machine learning===\nAttacks against (supervised) machine learning algorithms have been categorized along three primary axes:<ref name=\"Adversarial Machine Learning_2\" /> their influence on the classifier, the security violation they cause, and their specificity.\n\n* ''Attack influence'': An attack can have a causative influence if it aims to introduce vulnerabilities to be exploited at the classification phase by manipulating training data, or an exploratory influence if the attack aims to find and subsequently exploit vulnerabilities at classification phase. The attacker's capabilities might also be influenced by the presence of data manipulation constraints.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sikos |first=Leslie F. |title=AI in Cybersecurity |volume=151 |location=Cham |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-98841-2 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-98842-9 | page = 50 |series=Intelligent Systems Reference Library |year=2019 }}</ref>\n* ''Security violation'': An attack can cause an integrity violation if it aims to get malicious samples misclassified as legitimate, or it may cause an availability violation if the goal is to increase the wrong classification rate of legitimate samples, making the classifier unusable (e.g., a denial of service).\n* ''Attack specificity'': An attack can be targeted if specific samples are considered (e.g. the adversary aims to allow a specific intrusion or wants a given spam email to get past the filter), or indiscriminate.\n\nThis taxonomy has been extended into a more comprehensive threat model that allows one to make explicit assumptions on the adversary's goal, knowledge of the attacked system, capability of manipulating the input data and/or the system components, and on the corresponding (potentially, formally-defined) attack strategy.<ref name=\"Adversarial Machine Learning_4A\" /><ref name=\"Adversarial Machine Learning_5A\" /> Two of the main attack scenarios identified according to this threat model are described below.\n\n===Evasion attacks===\nEvasion attacks<ref name=\"Adversarial Machine Learning_4A\" /><ref name=\"Adversarial Machine Learning_5A\" /><ref name=\"Adversarial Machine Learning_36A\">B. Nelson, B. I. Rubinstein, L. Huang, A. D. Joseph, S. J. Lee, S. Rao, and J. D. Tygar. \"[http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume13/nelson12a/nelson12a.pdf Query strategies for evading convex-inducing classifiers]\". J. Mach. Learn. Res., 13:1293\u20131332, 2012</ref> are the most prevalent type of attack that may be encountered in adversarial settings during system operation. For instance, spammers and hackers often attempt to evade detection by obfuscating the content of spam emails and malware code. In the evasion setting, malicious samples are modified at test time to evade detection; that is, to be misclassified as legitimate. No attacker influence over the training data is assumed. A clear example of evasion is [[Image spam|image-based spam]] in which the spam content is embedded within an attached image to evade the textual analysis performed by anti-spam filters. Another example of evasion is given by spoofing attacks against biometric verification systems.<ref name=\"RodriguesLing2009\" />\n\n===Poisoning attacks===\nMachine learning algorithms are often re-trained on data collected during operation to adapt to changes in the underlying data distribution. For instance, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are often re-trained on a set of samples collected during network operation. Within this scenario, an attacker may poison the training data by injecting carefully designed samples to eventually compromise the whole learning process. Poisoning may thus be regarded as an adversarial contamination of the training data. Examples of poisoning attacks against machine learning algorithms including learning in the presence of worst-case adversarial label flips in the training data can be found in the following reference links.<ref name=\"Adversarial Machine Learning_4A\" /><ref name=\"Adversarial Machine Learning_5A\" /><ref name=\"Adversarial Machine Learning_2\" /><ref name=\"Adversarial Machine Learning_15A\">B.

For instance, clustering of malware and computer viruses aims to identify and categorize different existing malware families, and to generate specific signatures for their detection by anti-viruses or signature-based [[intrusion detection system]]s like Snort.\n\nHowever, clustering algorithms were not originally devised to deal with deliberate attack attempts that are designed to subvert the clustering process itself.

In 2012, deep neural networks were unexpectedly crowned as the dominant path for advanced computer vision; starting in 2014, Christian Szegedy and others demonstrated that deep neural networks could be fooled with tiny adjustments of the input.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Biggio |first1=Battista |last2=Roli |first2=Fabio |title=Wild patterns: Ten years after the rise of adversarial machine learning |journal=Pattern Recognition |date=December 2018 |volume=84 |pages=317\u2013331 |doi=10.1016/j.patcog.2018.07.023|arxiv=1712.03141 }}</ref>\n\n=== Other examples ===\nExamples include attacks in [[spam filtering]], where spam messages are obfuscated through the misspelling of \u201cbad\u201d words or the insertion of \u201cgood\u201d words;<ref name=\"BiggioFumera2010\">{{cite journal|last1=Biggio|first1=Battista|last2=Fumera|first2=Giorgio|last3=Roli|first3=Fabio|title=Multiple classifier systems for robust classifier design in adversarial environments|journal=International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics|volume=1|issue=1\u20134|year=2010|pages=27\u201341|issn=1868-8071|doi=10.1007/s13042-010-0007-7|url=http://pralab.diee.unica.it/en/node/671}}</ref><ref name=\"Adversarial Machine Learning_18A\">{{cite journal |last1=Br\u00fcckner |first1=Michael |last2=Kanzow |first2=Christian |last3=Scheffer |first3=Tobias |title=Static Prediction Games for Adversarial Learning Problems |journal=Journal of Machine Learning Research |date=2012 |volume=13 |issue=Sep |pages=2617\u20132654 |doi= |url=http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume13/brueckner12a/brueckner12a.pdf |issn=1533-7928}}</ref> attacks in [[computer security]], such as obfuscating malware code within [[network packet]]s or to mislead signature detection; attacks in biometric recognition where fake biometric traits may be exploited to impersonate a legitimate user;<ref name=\"RodriguesLing2009\">{{cite journal |last1=Rodrigues |first1=Ricardo N. |last2=Ling |first2=Lee Luan |last3=Govindaraju |first3=Venu |title=Robustness of multimodal biometric fusion methods against spoof attacks |journal=Journal of Visual Languages & Computing |date=1 June 2009 |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=169\u2013179 |doi=10.1016/j.jvlc.2009.01.010 |url=http://cubs.cedar.buffalo.edu/images/pdf/pub/robustness-of-multimodal-biometric-fusion-methods-against-spoof-attacks.pdf |language=en |issn=1045-926X}}</ref> or to compromise users' template galleries that adapt to updated traits over time.\n\nIn 2017, researchers at [[Kyushu University]] showed that by changing only one-pixel it was possible to fool current deep learning algorithms.<ref>{{Cite journal | arxiv=1710.08864| doi=10.1109/TEVC.2019.2890858| title=One Pixel Attack for Fooling Deep Neural Networks| year=2019| last1=Su| first1=Jiawei| last2=Vargas| first2=Danilo Vasconcellos| last3=Sakurai| first3=Kouichi| journal=IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation| volume=23| issue=5| pages=828\u2013841}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Su |first1=Jiawei |last2=Vargas |first2=Danilo Vasconcellos |last3=Sakurai |first3=Kouichi |title=One Pixel Attack for Fooling Deep Neural Networks |journal=IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation |date=October 2019 |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=828\u2013841 |doi=10.1109/TEVC.2019.2890858 |arxiv=1710.08864 |issn=1941-0026}}</ref> Moreover, at the same year, researchers at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] [[3-D print]]ed a toy turtle with a texture engineered to make Google's object detection [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] classify it as a rifle regardless of the angle from which the turtle was viewed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Single pixel change fools AI programs|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-41845878|accessdate=12 February 2018|work=BBC News|date=3 November 2017}}</ref> Creating the turtle required only low-cost commercially available 3-D printing technology.<ref>Athalye, A., & Sutskever, I.

However, proactive approaches are not necessarily superior to reactive ones: under some circumstances, reactive approaches are more suitable for improving system security.<ref name=\"Adversarial Machine Learning_3A\">A.

A substantial amount of work has been done in this direction.<ref name=\"Adversarial Machine Learning_4A\" /><ref name=\"Adversarial Machine Learning_5A\" /><ref name=\"Adversarial Machine Learning_46A\" /><ref name=\"Adversarial Machine Learning_2\">M.

Machine Learning, 81:121\u2013148, 2010</ref>\n\n===Taxonomy of potential attacks against machine learning===\nAttacks against (supervised) machine learning algorithms have been categorized along three primary axes:<ref name=\"Adversarial Machine Learning_2\" /> their influence on the classifier, the security violation they cause, and their specificity.\n\n* ''Attack influence'': An attack can have a causative influence if it aims to introduce vulnerabilities to be exploited at the classification phase by manipulating training data, or an exploratory influence if the attack aims to find and subsequently exploit vulnerabilities at classification phase. The attacker's capabilities might also be influenced by the presence of data manipulation constraints.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sikos |first=Leslie F. |title=AI in Cybersecurity |volume=151 |location=Cham |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-98841-2 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-98842-9 | page = 50 |series=Intelligent Systems Reference Library |year=2019 }}</ref>\n* ''Security violation'': An attack can cause an integrity violation if it aims to get malicious samples misclassified as legitimate, or it may cause an availability violation if the goal is to increase the wrong classification rate of legitimate samples, making the classifier unusable (e.g., a denial of service).\n* ''Attack specificity'': An attack can be targeted if specific samples are considered (e.g. the adversary aims to allow a specific intrusion or wants a given spam email to get past the filter), or indiscriminate.\n\nThis taxonomy has been extended into a more comprehensive threat model that allows one to make explicit assumptions on the adversary's goal, knowledge of the attacked system, capability of manipulating the input data and/or the system components, and on the corresponding (potentially, formally-defined) attack strategy.<ref name=\"Adversarial Machine Learning_4A\" /><ref name=\"Adversarial Machine Learning_5A\" /> Two of the main attack scenarios identified according to this threat model are described below.\n\n===Evasion attacks===\nEvasion attacks<ref name=\"Adversarial Machine Learning_4A\" /><ref name=\"Adversarial Machine Learning_5A\" /><ref name=\"Adversarial Machine Learning_36A\">B. Nelson, B. I. Rubinstein, L. Huang, A. D. Joseph, S. J. Lee, S. Rao, and J. D. Tygar. \"[http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume13/nelson12a/nelson12a.pdf Query strategies for evading convex-inducing classifiers]\". J. Mach. Learn. Res., 13:1293\u20131332, 2012</ref> are the most prevalent type of attack that may be encountered in adversarial settings during system operation. For instance, spammers and hackers often attempt to evade detection by obfuscating the content of spam emails and malware code. In the evasion setting, malicious samples are modified at test time to evade detection; that is, to be misclassified as legitimate. No attacker influence over the training data is assumed. A clear example of evasion is [[Image spam|image-based spam]] in which the spam content is embedded within an attached image to evade the textual analysis performed by anti-spam filters. Another example of evasion is given by spoofing attacks against biometric verification systems.<ref name=\"RodriguesLing2009\" />\n\n===Poisoning attacks===\nMachine learning algorithms are often re-trained on data collected during operation to adapt to changes in the underlying data distribution. For instance, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are often re-trained on a set of samples collected during network operation. Within this scenario, an attacker may poison the training data by injecting carefully designed samples to eventually compromise the whole learning process. Poisoning may thus be regarded as an adversarial contamination of the training data. Examples of poisoning attacks against machine learning algorithms including learning in the presence of worst-case adversarial label flips in the training data can be found in the following reference links.<ref name=\"Adversarial Machine Learning_4A\" /><ref name=\"Adversarial Machine Learning_5A\" /><ref name=\"Adversarial Machine Learning_2\" /><ref name=\"Adversarial Machine Learning_15A\">B.

For instance, clustering of malware and computer viruses aims to identify and categorize different existing malware families, and to generate specific signatures for their detection by anti-viruses or signature-based [[intrusion detection system]]s like Snort.\n\nHowever, clustering algorithms were not originally devised to deal with deliberate attack attempts that are designed to subvert the clustering process itself. If clustering can be safely adopted in such settings, this remains questionable.<ref name=\"Adversarial Machine Learning_42A\">D. B. Skillicorn. \"Adversarial knowledge discovery\".
