He joined Vauxhall in 1906 at the age of 22, as an assistant draughtsman. In the winter of 1907/8, the chief designer F. W. Hodges took a long holiday, and in his absence, the managing director Percy Kidner asked Pomeroy to design an [[internal combustion engine|engine]] for cars to be entered in the 1908 RAC and Scottish Reliability Trial, held in June that year. The cars were so successful that Pomeroy took over from Hodges.<ref name=Beaulieu>{{cite book|last=Georgano|first=N.  | authorlink=G. N. Georgano |title=Beaulieu Encyclopedia of the Automobile|year=2000|publisher=[[HMSO]] |isbn=1-57958-293-1}}</ref>\n\nPomeroy's first design, the Y-Type Y1, had outstanding success at the 1908 RAC and Scottish 2000 Mile Reliability Trials \u2013 showing excellent hill-climbing ability with an aggregate of 37 seconds less time in the hill climbs than any other car in its class. With unparalleled speeds around the [[Brooklands]] circuit, the Vauxhall was so far ahead of all other cars of any class that the driver could relax, accomplishing the {{convert|200|mi|km}} at an average speed of {{convert|46|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, when the car was capable of {{convert|55|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. The Y-Type went on to win class E of the trial.\n\nThe Y-Type was so successful that it was decided to put the car into production as the A09 car. This spawned the [[Vauxhall A-Type]]. Four distinct types of this were produced between 27 October 1908 and when mass production halted in 1914. One last A-Type was put together in 1920. Capable of up to {{convert|100|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, the A-Type Vauxhall was one of the most acclaimed three-litre cars of its day.\n\nTwo cars were entered in the 1910 Prince Henry Trials, and although not outright winners, performed well, and replicas were made for sale officially as the C-type, but now known as the [[Vauxhall Prince Henry|Prince Henry]]. During the First World War, Vauxhall made large numbers of the D-type, a Prince Henry chassis with derated engine, for use as [[staff car]]s for the British forces.\n\nAfter the 1918 armistice, the D-type remained in production, along with the sporting [[Vauxhall E-type|E-type]]. Pomeroy left in 1919, moving to the United States, and was replaced by C.E. King.<ref name=Beaulieu/> In spite of making good cars, expensive pedigree cars of the kind that had served the company well in the prosperous prewar years were no longer in demand;<ref name=Motor196811>{{cite magazine|author=Charles Bulmer (Ed)|title=Vauxhall Owners' Supplement: It started in 1857...|magazine=[[The Motor]]|volume=nbr 3466|pages=1\u201352|date=23 November 1968}}</ref> the company struggled to make a consistent profit and Vauxhall looked for a major strategic partner.\n\n===1925 to 1945===\n[[File:Vauxhall Light 6 1530cc Sep 1933.JPG|thumb|right|1933 Vauxhall Light Six. This was the first Vauxhall to sell in numbers comparable to rivals from the largest British car makers of the day.]]\nOn 16 November 1925, Vauxhall was acquired by [[General Motors Corporation]] for US$2.5&nbsp;million.<ref>Display advertisement: The Future of Vauxhall Motors by managing directors L Walton and PC Kidner. ''The Times'', Thursday, 26 November 1925; pg. 10; Issue 44129</ref> The company's image and target market were gently but firmly changed over the next five and more years, marked particularly by the introduction in late 1930 of the low-cost two-litre [[Vauxhall Cadet]] and the next year the first [[Bedford Vehicles|Bedford]] truck, which was [[Chevrolet]] based.<ref name=Motor196811/> Vauxhall's chief engineer since 1920, Charles Evelyn King,  retired as engineering director in 1950. The company's future chief engineer, Harold Drew, left Luton for a spell, working as a draughtsman with GM's [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]]-based [[Oldsmobile]] division.<ref name=Motor196811/> As the first significant post-acquisition passenger car, the Cadet, initially retailing at \u00a3280, is generally regarded as demonstrating Vauxhall's newly acquired interest and expertise in controlling production costs, but it was also the first British car to feature a [[synchromesh gearbox]].<ref name=Motor196811/>\n\nGeneral Motors continued to reposition Vauxhall towards the middle of the British car market, aiming to produce higher volumes of more conventional cars that, using GM's large engineering, design and production resources, would offer modern technology and high levels of equipment at a reasonable price with competitors being the likes of [[Wolseley Motors|Wolseley]], [[Humber Limited|Humber]] and the smaller [[Rover Company|Rovers]]. The Cadet had been the first step in this process, which gathered pace in June 1933 with the launch of the AS-type [[Vauxhall Light Six|Light Six]]. With an all-steel body and a refined and modern [[Overhead valve engine|overhead valve]] [[Straight-six engine|inline-six]] engine, the Light Six was produced in 12- and 14-[[Tax horsepower#Britain|'tax horsepower']] variants. Modernisation and expansion of the Luton factory meant that the Light Six was sold for \u00a3195 for the standard four-door saloon, which was significantly less than many of its older rivals with four-cylinder engines and less interior appointments, and Vauxhall made the unusual decision to offer both 12 and 14 models for the same price. Two-door saloon, coupe, tourer and cabriolet bodies were also available for extra cost, plus a range of other body designs from [[coachbuilder]]s. The Light Six was an immediate sale success, surpassing all previous Vauxhall products by a large margin with 26,000 examples being sold in just over 12 months and with the Luton factory moving onto 24-hour shift work to meet demand. Vauxhall had suddenly become a significant player in the British car market.\n\nAfter 15 months on sale the AS-type Light Six was replaced by the D-type Light Six. This was fundamentally the same as the outgoing model with minor styling and interior updates, but with one major engineering change - namely the addition of [[Dubonnet suspension]] to the front, making the new Light Six the first mass-production British saloon car with independent front suspension. The Dubonnet system was a GM patent, also used on [[Chevrolet]] and [[Pontiac]] models in the USA and on [[Opel]] cars in Europe. The D-type Light Six was priced at between \u00a3205 and \u00a3245 for the standard saloon depending on the exact specification, which was still a lower-than-average price for a car of the new Light Six's size, power, equipment and technical specification and this was another successful model for Vauxhall.\n[[File:1937_Vauxhall_H-type_Ten_1.2_Front.jpg|thumb|right|The 10-4 of 1937 was the first mass-production British unibody saloon car and was called \"The \u00a31 Million Motor Car\" after its costly and extensive development programme.]] \nThe overall strategy for Vauxhall continued to be to make smaller models with the latest engineering developments. Vauxhall and GM management planned a completely new three-model car range which would use cutting-edge [[Vehicle frame#Unibody|unibody]] construction instead of the traditional body-on-frame design. The first mass-production unibody car, the [[Citro\u00ebn Traction Avant]] began production in 1934, the same year that design work on the new Vauxhall range began. As well as designing an entirely new car body, this change required major expansion, renewal and investment in the Luton factory as well as a significant expansion of Vauxhall's engineering and design staff. The first of the new models was released in September 1937. This was the H-type [[Vauxhall 10-4|10-4]] (the model number referring to its 10 tax-horsepower, four-cylinder engine). This was the first truly small Vauxhall in many years. As well as its advanced unibody structure - a first for a British saloon car - the 10-4 also featured an overhead valve engine, fully hydraulic brakes and Dubonnet front suspension. Other features included a full-synchromesh gearbox, mechanical windscreen wipers and a 'six-stage' carburetor. Priced at \u00a3168-182, the 10-4 was only slightly more expensive than old-fashioned equivalents from [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]] and [[Morris Motors|Morris]] and cost around \u00a330 more than the cheapest 10-horsepower class car on sale, the [[Ford 7W]]. The model was promoted as \"The \u00a31 Million Motor Car\", reflecting the supposed investment in its design and production and was noted for its excellent fuel economy of over 40mpg when touring due to its efficient modern engine and lightweight body. The 10-4 was considered to be the finest small car in the world at the time of its launch and initial demand greatly exceeded production capacity. Just six months after the 10-4's launch, the 10,000th example left Luton - a production record for the Vauxhall at the time. The H-type 10-4 was only the first and smallest in the proposed trio of similarly advanced unibody cars. The I-type [[Vauxhall 12-4|12-4]] (essentially the same as the 10-4 but with a longer wheelbase and an enlarged engine) was introduced in September 1938 and the J-type [[Vauxhall 14-6|14-6]], replacing the old Light Six, was introduced the following month but sales did not begin until early 1939. This advanced three-model range was very well received by critics and buyers and placed Vauxhall in the vanguard of automotive engineering for the mass market in Britain. However the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in 1939 greatly restricted the sales of all new cars just as the new Vauxhall range was entering the market and production was reaching full flow. Car production was ceased entirely in May 1940, by which time over 50,000 10-4s, 10,000 12-4s and 15,000 14-6s had been built.\n\nDuring the Second World War, car production at Luton was suspended to allow Vauxhall to work on the new [[Churchill tank]]. Despite a bombing raid in August 1940, in which 39 employees were killed,<ref>Seymour, W.J. (1946). ''An Account of our Stewardship. Being a record of the war-time activities of Vauxhall motors Ltd.'' pp.90\u201394</ref> it was taken from specification to production in less than a year, and assembled there (as well as at other sites). More than 5,600 Churchill tanks were built. Luton also produced around 250,000 lorries for the war effort, alongside the new [[Bedford Dunstable plant]], which was opened in 1942, with Bedford designs being common in British use. As a morale booster for the company employees, on 23, 24, and 25 February 1944, [[Adelaide Hall]] appeared in concert at the factory in Luton, where she entertained the employees during their lunch break. In all, she performed in front of more than 10,000 workers; this was the first time that Vauxhall had contracted a star to perform at their factory for three consecutive days.<ref>[[Adelaide Hall]] performs at Vauxhall Factory in 1944: (retrieved 10 September 1014) http://www.wartimememories.co.uk/women.html</ref>\n[[File:Churchill IV.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Churchill tank|Mk IV Churchill tank (75mm)]], of which 7,368 were manufactured by Vauxhall between 1941 and 1945]]\n\n===1945 to 1970===\n[[File:Vauxhall_Wyvern_ca_1949_at_Weston_Park.JPG|right|thumb|The L-Type Wyvern was the first new post-war Vauxhall and was essentially a reskin of the pre-war 10-4.]]\nVauxhall was one of the first British car makers to switch from wartime to civilian production, mostly due to the ease with which [[Bedford Vehicles|Bedford]] trucks in production for military use could be redirected to the civilian market. The first post-war civilian trucks were made a few days before [[Victory over Japan Day|VJ Day]] in August 1945, with Vauxhall car production resuming in September. These initial models were essentially unchanged from the three-model range (H-, I-, and J-type unibody designs) that had been launched just before the outbreak of war in 1939. However, they were now renamed simply as the Vauxhall Ten, Twelve and Fourteen respectively, were each available in a single body and specification (four-door saloons to what had been the Deluxe trim level) to ease production and had minor internal and external trim differences to account for shortages or extra costs of various materials. Government regulations of the time meant that 75% of production had to be sent for export, so very few of these revived models reached buyers in the United Kingdom. Further rationalisation occurred in 1946 when the Twelve ceased to be a distinct model and now shared the body of the Ten but with the larger-capacity engine.\n\nThese models were superseded by 'new' cars in 1948. GM management had dictated that Luton should only utilise a single body design in order to maximise productivity and reduce supply costs. The British government had also revoked the RAC [[tax horsepower|taxable horsepower]] system and replaced it with a flat charge per vehicle regardless of engine size. This meant that there was no longer such an imperative to offer similar models with different engine capacities to fit in the different bands of the old tax system. Therefore, the new 1948 L-Type Vauxhalls consisted of just a pair of models, both using the body structure, floorpan and many running gear parts of the H-type/Ten model. However Vauxhall's director of styling, David Jones, managed to fit brand new exterior panels to the front, rear and rear-quarters of the old body centre-section to give the L-type a modern look which shared its basic shape and features with GM's [[Chevrolet Fleetline]] of the same year, albeit at a much smaller scale. The new models were the [[Vauxhall Wyvern#Wyvern LIX (1948\u201351)|Wyvern]] (using the four-cylinder engine previously used in the Twelve) and the [[Vauxhall Velox#Velox LIP & LBP (1948\u201351)|Velox]] using a new wide-bore development of the six-cylinder engine from the Fourteen. Otherwise, the L-Types reused the three-speed transmission (albeit with a switch to a [[Manual transmission#Column-mounted shifter|column gear change]], hydraulic brakes and Dubonnet suspension of the pre-war models essentially unchanged. Those predecessors had been advanced for their time so the Wyvern and Velox were still competitive despite being considered small and cramped alongside the likes of the [[Morris Minor]] and [[Austin A40 Devon]]. The Velox especially, with its smooth and powerful engine in a relatively small car, offered strong performance and good reliability to compete against the V8-powered [[Ford Pilot]].\n\n[[File:Vauxhall Wyvern 1507cc registered September 1952.JPG|right|thumb|The E-Type Vauxhalls (this is a Wyvern) used a brand new body and were much larger and more refined than their predecessors.]]\nThe L-Types were replaced by a truly new model, the E-Types, in 1951 with the new cars having been in development since 1948. GM was still restricting Vauxhall to a one-body policy and the range still consisted of two models differentiated mostly by their engines - the four-cylinder [[Vauxhall Wyvern#Wyvern EIX (1951\u201357)|EIX Wyvern]] and the six-cylinder [[Vauxhall Velox#Velox LIP & LBP (1948\u201351)|EIP Velox]]. While they were designed at Luton they drew a lot of influence from styling developments made in [[Detroit]], especially the revised 1951-model year [[Chevrolet]]s. The E-Types continued the use of unibody construction, but of a brand new and much larger design with full-width '[[Ponton (car)|pontoon]]' styling. They offered significantly more cabin and luggage space and a great deal of effort was put into both the styling of the interior and the reduction of vibration and noise. The complicated Dubonnet suspension system was replaced by more conventional design using coil springs and twin wishbones with telescopic dampers, while the rear axle retained leaf springs but also with the addition of telescopic dampers. The transmission and steering remained little-changed from the existing design. Vauxhall planned and developed a new range of short-stroke overhead-valve engines for the E-Types but financial and production constraints meant that the first new Wyverns and Veloxes were launched with the same engines as the outgoing L-Type. In the bigger, heavier E-Type models these gave very poor performance, especially the Wyvern with an engine all-but unchanged since 1937. The new engines, both slightly larger than the existing design, were fitted to both models during 1952 and brought performance up to a competitive level. In terms of price and production the E-Type Vauxhalls were now full contenders in the mid-size car market in Britain, alongside the likes of the [[Ford Consul EOTA (1951\u20131956)|Ford Consul]]/[[Ford Zephyr#Zephyr Six (or Zephyr Mark I)|Zephyr]], the [[Austin Cambridge#A50 Cambridge|Austin Cambridge]] and especially the increasingly old-fashioned [[Hillman Minx#Minx Mark I to VIII (1945\u201357)|Hillman Minx]]. By 1953 Vauxhall was building 110,000 E-Type models at Luton per year, with around half of production going to export - mostly in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] markets which still maintained preferential tariffs for British-made products. For 1955, the E-Type Vauxhalls received a facelift with new frontal and interior styling and minor mechanical refinements. Most importantly, Vauxhall returned to offering three car models (albeit all still sharing a single body design) with the addition of the [[Vauxhall Cresta|Cresta]], which was a more luxuriously-styled and appointed version of the Velox. Following GM practice from America, from this point Vauxhall began offering annual minor updates, improvements and styling changes to its cars to both keep up with competitors and to tempt existing owners to replace their car.\n\nSince the restarting of car production in 1945 the limiting factor for Vauxhall sales had been production, sometimes leading to lengthy waiting lists for customers. While the Luton factory had been expanded and modernised in the early 1950s, the main restriction was the lack of capacity for building the unitary bodyshells. Expansion of the body shop would require large investment that GM was reluctant to release and this was the main reason for Vauxhall relying on a single body design across three distinct models. In 1954 GM management sanctioned a switch to a two-body line-up at Vauxhall with concurrent investment to expand both the body shop and production lines at Luton. The new model would replace the four-cylinder Wyvern with a smaller car using the same engine, bringing Vauxhall into line with the established norm for cars in the 1.5-litre class - the E-Type Wyvern was a significantly larger car than its direct competitors. The new car would be launched for 1957 alongside new Velox/Cresta models which could, correspondingly, be slightly enlarged since their body no longer had to be shared with a model in the class below.\n\nThe small model, named the [[Vauxhall Victor#F Series Victor|F-Type Victor]] was announced first in February 1957. Although its engineering followed familiar Vauxhall lines - a unitary structure, independent front suspension with coil springs, a leaf-sprung live rear axle and a 1.5-litre four-cylinder overhead valve engine with a three-speed manual transmission with column-mounted change - it was, by necessity, virtually all brand new. The drivetrain was largely lifted from the outgoing E-Type Wyvern, but the engine received a higher [[compression ratio]] and updated carburation to account for the new widespread availability of [[Octane rating|high octane]] fuel and so made more power. Stylistically the Victor followed the familiar Vauxhall trend of following American styling trends, although the Victor took this to a new level by closely resembling the famous [[Chevrolet Bel Air#Second generation (1955\u20131957)|1955 Chevrolet Bel Air]], complete with [[Car tailfin|tailfins]], prominent 'flutes' on the bonnet (a modern evocation of a familiar Vauxhall styling cue dating back to the 1920s), wrap-around front and rear screens, large chromed bumpers and an exhaust tailpipe integrated into one of the rear overriders. A year after launch the Victor would also provide the basis for Vauxhall's first factory-built [[estate car]].\n\nThe new P-Type Velox/Cresta models were announced in October 1957. Like the Victor these essentially featured updated versions of the drivetrain (and running gear) from the E-Type models in a new, larger and much more flamboyantly-styled body. American styling cues were again much in evidence, this time being heavily influenced by a 1954 [[Cadillac]] [[concept car]] called the Park Avenue.\n\nBoth the new Vauxhall models continued the success of their predecessors. The Victor achieved new sales records for Vauxhall and in the late 1950s was Britain's most exported car, being sold in most right-hand drive car markets such as Australia, [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Thailand]] and [[Singapore]]. The model was also sold in left-hand drive form by General Motors in [[Canada]] (under the specially-created [[Envoy (automobile)|Envoy]] name and under the original Vauxhall Victor name through [[Pontiac]] dealerships in the USA. Nearly 400,000 F-Type Victors were built at Luton between the start of 1957 and the end of production in mid-1961. With the Victor taking the place of many previous Wyvern sales, the P-Type models did not sell in the same quantities as the entire E-Type range had, but over 180,000 were built between October 1957 and July 1962 with over 100,000 of those cars being exported. Both the Victor and the Velox/Cresta received criticism for their overtly American styling, which many reviewers saw as gaudy against more conservative British tastes. Both models had their styling revised in 1959 to remove some of the more extreme styling details. Both models also quickly developed a reputation for rapid and severe structural corrosion. The F-Type Victor was especially badly affected by this issue, caused by a combination of thin-gauge steel to minimise weight, numerous moisture traps in its body design (for instance the hidden tailpipe design encouraged corrosive exhaust gases and condensation to collect in the rear wing corners), the fitting of a plasticised underseal treatment to the floorpan which served to trap moisture and dirt once it became chipped or cracked and the fact that the Victor was built in quantities and rates that the Luton plant had not previously dealt with.\n\n[[File:En Vauxhall bliver demonstreret af s\u00e6lgeren (5883732955).jpg|right|thumb|A buyer and seller looking under the bonnet of a Vauxhall at a dealership in Denmark in the 1950s]]\nA manufacturing plant at [[Ellesmere Port]], Cheshire, was opened in 1962, initially making components to supply to the production lines in Luton, before passenger-car production began there in 1964.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.factorytour.co.uk/ellesmereport/ |title=Ellesmere Port car factory- Vauxhall, Opel |publisher=Factorytour.co.uk |accessdate=23 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314155901/http://www.factorytour.co.uk/ellesmereport/ |archivedate=14 March 2012  }}</ref>\n\nIn 1963, production of the [[Vauxhall Viva (1963\u20131979)|Vauxhall Viva]] small family car commenced, with the new car being aimed at the likes of the [[Ford Anglia]] and [[Morris Minor]]. The German version of the car was sold as the [[Opel Kadett]]. The locally assembled Vauxhall Viva was launched in Australia in May 1964. In 1966, Vauxhall's [[Vauxhall Slant-4 engine|Slant Four]] went into production \u2013 the first production [[overhead camshaft]] [[inline-four engine]] to use a rubber [[timing belt (camshaft)|timing belt]]. Also, the FD Victor was launched at the [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earls Court]] [[British International Motor Show#1966|Motor Show]], considered by many to be one of Vauxhall's finest all-British styling efforts.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Vauxhall acquired a reputation for making rust-prone models. The corrosion protection built into models was tightened up significantly, but the reputation dogged the company until at least the early 1980s.\n\nIn 1967, Vauxhall became a Royal Warrant Holder: Motor Vehicle Manufacturers to HM The Queen \u2013 the Royal Mews. The warrant of HRH The Prince of Wales was added in 1994.\n\nBy the late 1960s, the company was achieving five-figure sales on its most popular models, including the entry-level Viva and larger [[Vauxhall Victor|Victor]].\n\n===1970 to 1990===\nIn 1970, the HC Viva was launched, which went on to become Vauxhall's best-selling car of the decade, featuring among the 10 best-selling cars in Britain each year until after 1976, with production not finishing until 1979, when the Viva nameplate was finally discontinued after 16 years and three generations. In 1973, the [[Vauxhall Firenza|Vauxhall Firenza \"Droopsnoot\"]] coupe was unveiled at the Earls Court Motor Show, introducing the public to Vauxhall's new aerodynamic look for all of its subsequent 1970s models.\n\nBy 1973, the Victor was losing sales in a market that was becoming increasingly dominated by the [[Ford Cortina]]. This was not enough to keep Vauxhall from being well behind market leaders [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[British Leyland]] in sales, and most of its range was struggling even to keep pace with [[Chrysler Europe|Chrysler UK]] (formerly the [[Rootes Group]]).\n[[File:Vauxhall Cavalier first iteration Brecon.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Vauxhall Cavalier#Mark I (1975\u201381)|Cavalier Mark I]], in production from 1975 to 1981]]\n\nVauxhall's sales began to increase from 1975, with the launch of two important new models, the [[Vauxhall Chevette|Chevette]], a small three-[[vehicle door|door]] [[hatchback]] that was the first car of its kind to be built in Britain, and the [[Vauxhall Cavalier#Mk1|Cavalier]], a stylish four-door [[sedan (automobile)|saloon]] designed to compete head-to-head with the all-conquering Ford Cortina. A two-door coupe and three-door \"sport hatch\" had joined the Cavalier range by 1978, but there never was an estate version. The Cavalier helped Vauxhall regain lost ground in this crucial sector of the market, while the Chevette proved to be hugely popular in the growing supermini sector, as more buyers turned to smaller cars following the oil crisis of 1973. The Chevette range later evolved into a three-door estate, as well as saloons with two or four doors.\nBoth models were based on models produced by Opel, GM's German subsidiary, the Chevette being based on the [[Opel Kadett]], but with a distinct front end. Along with the [[Chevrolet Chevette]] in the US and Canada, the Chevette and Kadett were built on [[GM T platform (1973)|GM's T-Car platform]]. Similarly, the Cavalier was based on the [[Opel Ascona]], but featured the front end of the [[Opel Manta|Manta]], as did the [[Chevrolet Chevair]] in [[South Africa]]. These models were built on the [[GM J platform]].\n\nThis marked the end of a long and gradual process by GM to consolidate its two European subsidiaries with preference for the larger, and in terms of both absolute sales and market share, more successful Opel. Since the early 1960s, Vauxhalls, whilst being designed and built in the United Kingdom, increasingly shared their general specification, engineering features, and styling with Opel counterparts (the Viva with the Kadett and the Victor with the [[Opel Rekord|Rekord]], for instance) even if the two cars were distinct, with few to any interchangeable parts. From the late 1960s and into the early 1970s, increasing economic turmoil in the UK, declining build quality, and increasing [[strike action]] throughout British industry (and in stark contrast, the ''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]'' or economic miracle of [[West Germany]] during the same period), plus the entry of the UK into the [[European Economic Community]] in 1973, made maintaining two parallel model lines serving similar markets increasingly undesirable. The [[Vauxhall Victor#FE Series Victor, VX4/90, Ventora, VX1800 and VX2|FE Series Victor]], launched in 1972, would be the last all-British Vauxhall. Following the introduction of the Chevette and Cavalier, virtually all future Vauxhalls would be lightly restyled Opels (the exceptions would be based on models from elsewhere in the GM organisation). However, Vauxhall retained its two British factories at Luton and Ellesmere Port, with most cars wearing the Vauxhall badge still being built in the UK.\n\nThe introduction of the Opel-based Vauxhalls marked a significant improvement in both the design and build quality of Vauxhall cars, which were now considered strong rivals to their Ford competitors. By the end of the 1970s, Vauxhall had boosted its market share substantially, and was fast closing in on Ford and British Leyland.\n\nIn 1978, Vauxhall strengthened its position in the [[executive car]] market with the launch of its all-new [[Vauxhall Carlton|Carlton]] saloon and estate, which were facelifted versions of the German-built [[Opel Rekord Series E|Opel Rekord]]. A year later, a more upmarket saloon model, the [[Opel Senator|Senator]], was launched under the Opel brand, and finally became available as a Vauxhall from 1983.\n\nBy 1979, Vauxhall had increased its market share substantially; it was still some way behind Ford and British Leyland, but had overtaken [[Talbot]] (the [[Peugeot]]-owned successor to [[Rootes Group|Rootes]] and [[Chrysler Europe|Chrysler UK]]).\n\n[[File:Vauxhall Astra Mk I Clare.jpg|thumb|right|The Vauxhall Astra Mk I, in production from 1979 to 1984]]\nEarly in 1980, Vauxhall moved into the modern family hatchback market with its [[Vauxhall Astra|Astra]] range that replaced the aging Viva, and quickly became popular with buyers. The Astra was a rebadged version of the first front-wheel drive Opel Kadett, which had been launched in 1979, and was sold alongside the Astra for several years.\n\nIn 1981, the company released the [[Vauxhall Cavalier#Mk2|Mk2 Cavalier]], the first Vauxhall of this size to offer [[front-wheel drive]] and a hatchback bodystyle. Built at the Luton plant, it really boosted Vauxhall's fortunes, with the Cavalier's sales for 1982 almost trebling its total for 1981, and peaking at more than 130,000 by 1984. During that time, sales of the Vauxhall brand more than doubled.  This was complemented in 1983 with an [[station wagon|estate]], based on the [[Holden Camira|Camira]] produced in [[Australia]] by [[Holden]], with the tailgates for the Vauxhall version being built there and shipped to Luton. It was Britain's second-best selling car in 1984 and 1985, and spent most of its production life vying with the [[Ford Sierra]] for top place in the large family car market. The Cavalier was relaunched in 1988, an all-new format that won praise for its sleek looks and much-improved resistance to rust.\n\nApril 1983 had the launch of the [[Opel Corsa|Nova]] supermini, a rebadged version of the [[Spain|Spanish]]-built Opel Corsa. The new entry-level model in the Vauxhall range, it was available as a hatchback or a saloon and was solely built at the Zaragoza plant in Spain. This completed Vauxhall's regeneration, and by the end of the 1980s, it had overtaken [[Austin Rover]] (formerly British Leyland) as Britain's second-most popular carmaker. The arrival of the Nova also spelled the end of the Chevette in 1984 after nearly a decade in production.\n\nThe Astra further strengthened its position in the market with an all-new model in the autumn of 1984, featuring an aerodynamic design reminiscent of Ford's larger Sierra.\n[[File:Vauxhall Carlton JRHospital cropped.jpg|thumb|right|The Vauxhall Carlton Mark I]]\nIn 1984, the aerodynamically styled Vauxhall Astra Mk2 built at the Ellesmere Port Plant became the first Vauxhall car to be elected [[European Car of the Year]]. From the spring of 1985, the Vauxhall Nova was also available as a four-door saloon and five-door hatchback.\n\nIn January 1986, Vauxhall launched the [[Vauxhall Belmont|Belmont]], a saloon version of the Astra, which offered more interior space and was almost as big as a Cavalier. However, this car failed to reach Vauxhall's expectations in terms of sales, and from 1989 was rebadged the Astra Belmont.\n\nVauxhall won another \"European Car of the Year\" award with its all-new [[Vauxhall Carlton]], a rebadged Opel-built vehicle and badged Opel Omega in the rest of Europe, sealing the award for 1987. A year after the launch of the MK2 Carlton, Vauxhall revitalised its flagship Senator to create a new-generation luxury saloon.\n\nThe Luton-built [[Vauxhall Cavalier#Mk3|Cavalier (Mk3)]] (sold as the [[Opel Vectra]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and mainland Europe) entered its third generation in 1988 with an all-new sleek design that further enhanced its popularity. The [[Opel Calibra|Calibra]] [[coup\u00e9]] followed in 1989, which was officially the most aerodynamic production car in the world on its launch. Falling between the Cavalier and Senator was the Opel-built [[Vauxhall Carlton|Carlton]] (Opel Rekord and later [[Opel Omega]] elsewhere) \u2013 relaunched in 1986, and was voted [[European Car of the Year]], a large four-door family saloon. The two sports versions of the Carlton were the 3000&nbsp;GSi and the [[Lotus Carlton]], the latter being aimed at family-minded executives, and at {{convert|175|mi/h|km/h}}, considered the fastest four-door production car at the time. Most importantly, the latest generation of Vauxhall models dispelled the image of rusting cars that had for so long put potential buyers off the Vauxhall brand, and given it a strong competitor in all the major market sectors, whereas during the first half of the 1970s, only the Viva was a serious threat to any of its key rivals.\n\nAt the end of the 1970s, General Motors had decided to restrict the Opel brand on the UK market to sporting models, and with the success and wide range choice of the new Vauxhall products of the early 1980s, the Manta was the only Opel-badged car being imported to the UK by the end of 1984. When the Manta was finally discontinued in 1988, Opel models were no longer officially imported to the UK. Its successor, the Calibra, was badged as a Vauxhall on the UK market.\n\nBy 1990, Vauxhall was preparing to launch the MK3 Astra, and its first 4X4 off-road vehicle, while a replacement for the Nova was also in development.\n\n===1990 to 2000===\n[[File:VauxhallGriffinHouse.jpg|thumb|235px|Griffin House became the Vauxhall headquarters building in 1991. It had previously been the design and testing building.]]\nIn 1991, Vauxhall's corporate headquarters were moved to Griffin House, formerly the company's design and testing building.<ref>{{cite book |title=General Motors in the 20th century|first1=James |last1=Bush |first2=Alan |last2=Binder |first3=Deebe |last3=Ferris| publisher=Ward's Communications |year=2000 |page=170 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gsXhAAAAMAAJ&q=General+Motors+in+the+20th+century&dq=General+Motors+in+the+20th+century&hl=en&sa=X&ei=BK1fT_vlMuuV0QW5na38Bg&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA |accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref> In the same year, the third-generation Vauxhall Astra went on sale (with Opel versions adopting the Astra nameplate for the first time) and the saloon version badged Astra rather than Belmont. Vauxhall joined forces with [[Isuzu]] to produce the [[Opel Frontera|Frontera]], a [[four-wheel drive]] off-roader available in short- and long-wheelbase versions.\n\nIn 1993, the [[Vauxhall Cavalier|Cavalier]] was firmly re-established as Britain's most popular large family car, with more than 130,000 sales, while the third-generation [[Vauxhall Astra|Astra]] (relaunched in 1991) with 100,000 sales was continuing to narrow the gap between itself and the best-selling [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]]. The Astra was now joined by the Belmont, a four-door booted version of the Astra. This continued for some time until being renamed Astra, presumably to provide combined sales/registration figures. The decade-old Nova was axed in 1993, in favour of the all-new [[Opel Corsa|Corsa]], adopting the European naming of the model; its distinctive styling and practical interior began attracting more sales than its predecessor had done.\n\nIn 1994, GM ceased production of Bedford Vehicles because their profits were decreasing over time. Bedford Vehicles had been Vauxhall's commercial vehicle arm, making successful vans, trucks, and lorries since the 1930s.  The last \"true\" Bedford light commercials \u2013 the [[Bedford HA]] and [[Bedford CF]] panel vans \u2013 had already ceased production in 1983 and 1987, respectively, and had been replaced by licence-built versions of Isuzu and Suzuki vans such as the [[Isuzu Fargo|Midi]] and [[Suzuki Carry|Rascal]].  Production of these models continued at Luton, now badged Vauxhall, but built by a separate company named IBC ('''I'''suzu-'''B'''edford '''C'''ommercials).  Also in 1994, the Vauxhall Carlton nameplate was abandoned after 16 years, and [[Vauxhall Omega|Omega]] took its place, becoming the first model to feature the new corporate \"V\" grille. Vauxhall also added another vehicle to its four-wheel drive line-up in the shape of the Isuzu-based [[Vauxhall Monterey|Monterey]]. Vauxhall joined the expanding \"compact coup\u00e9\" market with its new Corsa-based [[Vauxhall Tigra|Tigra]] model.\n\nThe Cavalier nameplate was axed in 1995 after 20 years, a full model after Opel had dropped its Ascona nameplate, Vauxhall adopting the common [[Opel Vectra#Vectra B|Vectra]] nameplate for its successor, completing a policy by [[General Motors]] that aligned and identically badged all Vauxhall and Opel models. Vectra received disappointing feedback from the motoring public, and several well-known journalists, most notably [[Jeremy Clarkson]], yet it was still hugely popular, and for a while after the 1999 facelift, it was actually more popular than Ford's highly acclaimed [[Ford Mondeo|Mondeo]]. In 1996, Vauxhall launched the short-lived [[Vauxhall Sintra|Sintra]] large MPV. The Astra entered its fourth generation in 1998, and offered levels of build quality and handling that were better than all of its predecessors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisebuyers.co.uk/motoring/car-reviews/Vauxhall/Astra+%281998-04%29/1111/|title=Reviews \u2013 Vauxhall|publisher=WiseBuyer's Guides|accessdate=10 September 2009}}</ref>\n[[File:1995 Vauxhall Omega 2.5 TD GLS Estate (15681465168).jpg|thumb|right|A 1995 Vauxhall Omega 2.5 TD GLS Estate]]\nIn 1999, the seven-seater [[compact MPV]] [[Vauxhall Zafira|Zafira]], based on the Astra chassis, went on sale and the Vauxhall Monterey was withdrawn from sale in the UK, although it continued to sell in the rest of Europe as an Opel.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Vauxhall received criticism in several high-profile car surveys. In 1998, a ''[[Top Gear (1977 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' customer-satisfaction survey condemned the [[Opel Vectra|Vauxhall Vectra]] as the least satisfying car to own in Britain. A year later, the Vauxhall marque was ranked last by the same magazine's customer-satisfaction survey. The Vauxhall range received particular criticism for breakdowns, build-quality problems, and many other maladies, which meant that quality did not reflect sales success. Nevertheless, Vauxhall was competing strongly in the sales charts, and by 1999 was closer to Ford in terms of sales figures than it had been in years.\n\n===2000 to 2010===\nIn 2000, Vauxhall entered the sports car market with the [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]]-based [[Vauxhall VX220|VX220]] roadster. It re-entered the coup\u00e9 market with the Astra Coup\u00e9. The new [[Opel Agila|Agila]] city car and a second-generation  [[Vauxhall Corsa|Corsa]] supermini also went on sale. On 12 December 2000, Vauxhall announced that car production at its Luton plant would cease in 2002, with the final vehicle being made in March 2002 following the end of production of the Vectra B and production of its replacement moving to Ellesmere Port alongside the Astra. Manufacture of vans (sold under the Vauxhall, Opel, [[Renault]], and [[Nissan]] badges throughout Europe) continued at the [[IBC Vehicles]] plant in Luton. On 17 May 2006, Vauxhall announced the loss of 900 jobs from Ellesmere Port's 3,000 staff, part of significant worldwide staff reductions by GM.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4988616.stm|title=Business &#124; Vauxhall confirms 900 job losses|work=BBC News |date=17 May 2006|accessdate=1 June 2009}}</ref>\n[[File:2006 Vauxhall Astra Life CDTi 90 1.2 Front.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Vauxhall Astra#Vauxhall Astra Mark 5|Astra Mark V]], in production from 2004 to 2009]]\n[[File:2007 Vauxhall Vectra Exclusive CDTi 150 Automatic 2.0 Front.jpg|thumb|right|The Vauxhall Vectra Mark II, in production from 2002 to 2008]]\n[[File:Vauxhall Vehicles on forecourt.jpg|thumb|right|[[Vauxhall Corsa]]s on sale at a former dealership in [[Wetherby]], [[West Yorkshire]]]]\n\nIn 2002, the all-new Vectra went on sale, alongside a large hatchback badged as the [[Vauxhall Signum|Signum]], which arrived the following year. The year 2002 was one of the best ever for Vauxhall sales in the UK. The Corsa was Britain's second-most popular new car, and gave the marque top spot in the British supermini car sales charts for the first time. The Astra was Britain's third-best selling car that year, while the [[Vauxhall Vectra|Vectra]] and the Zafira (a [[compact MPV]] launched in 1999) were just outside the top 10. The second-generation Vectra was launched in 2002 and was further improved over earlier Vectras, but was still hardly a class-leader, and now had to be content with lower sales due to a fall in popularity of D-sector cars, although a facelift in 2005 sparked a rise in sales.\n\nIn 2003, Vauxhall Omega production ended after nine years, with no direct replacement, while the [[Vauxhall Meriva|Meriva]] mini-MPV was launched. Perhaps the most important Vauxhall product of the 2000s so far is the fifth-generation Astra, launched in early 2004, and praised by the motoring press for its dramatic styling. It was an instant hit with British buyers, and was the nation's second-best selling car in 2005 and 2006, giving the [[Ford Focus (international)|Ford Focus]] its strongest competitor yet. Many police forces across the United Kingdom adopted the Astra as the standard patrol vehicle ([[panda car]]). Also in 2004, production of the Frontera ended after 13 years, with no direct replacement.\n\nIn 2006, the third generation of the Vauxhall Corsa went on sale, after having its world premier launch at the [[British International Motor Show#2006|2006 British International Motor Show]] at [[ExCeL London]]. The second-generation Corsa had been Britain's most popular supermini for most of its production life, but by 2006, it had started to fall behind the best of its competitors, so an all-new model was launched. This Corsa sold far better than either of the previous Corsas, and it was an instant hit with buyers. Also in 2006, the second-generation Zafira was the 10th-best selling car in the UK, the first time that an MPV had featured in the top 10 in Britain.\n\nIn 2007, Vauxhall's new 4x4, the [[Vauxhall Antara]], was released in July. Vauxhall's powerful [[HSV Clubsport|VXR8]] that came with {{convert|306|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}} was also introduced.\n\nIn 2008, Vauxhall began rebranding with a modified corporate logo. The [[Vauxhall Insignia]] was launched at the [[British International Motor Show#2008|2008 British International Motor Show]] at ExCeL London, replacing the Vectra and won another \"European Car of the Year\". Vauxhall launched the new Agila city car.\n\nIn 2009, a new generation of the Vauxhall Astra was launched.\n\nOn 30 May 2009, a deal was announced that was to lead to the spin-off of the Vauxhall and Opel brands into a new company. On 1 June 2009, Vauxhall Motors' troubled parent company, General Motors, filed for bankruptcy in a court in New York. By then, the sale of Vauxhall and its German sister subsidiary, Opel, was being negotiated as part of a strategy driven by the German government to ring fence the businesses from any General Motors asset liquidation.<ref name=\"Bloomberg-Sandler-et al-2009-06-01\">{{cite news|date=1 June 2009|accessdate=1 June 2009|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a4brqCWwvYXY|title=GM Files Bankruptcy to Spin Off More Competitive Firm (Update4)|publisher=Bloomberg LP|first=Linda|last=Sandler|author2=Chris Scinta|author3=Bob Van Voris|author4=Jeff Green|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205223206/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a4brqCWwvYXY|archivedate=5 December 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-Sanger-Zeleny-Vlasic-2009-05-31\">{{cite news|last=Sanger|first=David E. |author2=Jeff Zeleny |author3=Bill Vlasic|work=New York Times|title=G.M. to Seek Bankruptcy and a New Start: A Risky Bet to Save an Icon of American Capitalism|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/01/business/01auto.html|date=31 May 2009|accessdate=1 June 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-Sanger-2009-05-31\">{{cite news|title=G.M. to Seek Bankruptcy and a New Start|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/01/business/01auto.html|last=Sanger|first=David E.|work=New York Times|date=31 May 2009|accessdate=1 June 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-Maynard-2009-05-29\">{{cite news|title=After 93 Years, G.M.

These vehicles are high-performance machines, and are ideally aimed for younger buyers. Vauxhall unveiled a new model based on the Australian [[HSV Maloo]] at the 2005 [[National Exhibition Centre]] motor show in [[Birmingham]], England. It was claimed that the monstrous V8 Ute had a top speed around {{convert|200|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} \u2013 which is extremely fast for a [[utility vehicle]]. However, the model never got to the showroom in the United Kingdom. The Monaro (two-door design) is also no longer made, but a new version (a four-door saloon) is now on sale as the VXR8. The VXR8 is based on Australia's [[HSV Clubsport R8]]. This car reaches 0\u201360 in 5 seconds, in similar territory to other muscle car contemporaries such as the [[Dodge Viper|Dodge Viper (SRT-10)]] and [[Corvette Z06 (disambiguation)|Corvette Z06]] \u2013 and marginally slower than the [[FPV FG F6|Ford Performance Vehicles (FPV) FG F6]].

production from 1975 to 1984]]\nGeneral Motors began to merge the product lines of Vauxhall and Opel in the early 1970s, largely in favour of Opel products. The 1963 [[Vauxhall Viva|HA Viva]] was developed under some secrecy and exhibited remarkable similarities with the [[Opel Kadett A|Opel Kadett]] released a year previously, while the 1972 [[Vauxhall Victor|FE Victor]] was essentially the first overt exponent of this strategy, sharing its platform and several body fittings with the [[Opel Rekord|Opel Rekord D]], although it still retained Vauxhall-designed running gear and had no interchangeable body panels. 1975 saw the release of both the [[Vauxhall Chevette]], (a reworked [[Opel Kadett C|Opel Kadett]] featuring 'Droopsnoot' styling and an initially unique hatchback bodystyle option), and the [[Vauxhall Cavalier|Cavalier]], a similarly restyled [[Opel Ascona|Ascona]]. By the end of the 1970s most Vauxhalls were based on Opel designs.

The original [[Vauxhall Astra|Astra]], launched in 1980, set the eventual precedent for all GM Europe vehicles from that point onward \u2013 apart from the badging it had no styling or engineering difference from its Opel sister \u2013 the Kadett D. In the late '70s and early '80s, GM dealers in Ireland and in the United Kingdom sold highly similar Opel and Vauxhall models alongside each other. This policy of duplication was phased out when the Vauxhall and Opel dealer networks were merged and rebranded as Vauxhall-Opel in 1982, and most of the Opel range was discontinued in the United Kingdom in favour of their Vauxhall badged equivalents.  Opel was instead repositioned as a performance-luxury brand \u2013 the [[Opel Manta]] coup\u00e9 remained, whilst the [[Vauxhall Royale]] was replaced in the line-up by its Opel equivalent (the [[Opel Senator|Senator]]/[[Opel Monza|Monza]]).  However, this strategy was gradually abandoned \u2013 the Senator reverted to being badged as a Vauxhall for the 1985 model year, and the Opel Monza disappeared at the end of 1987, whilst the Manta was withdrawn in 1988.\n[[File:Vauxhall Carlton Caravan in Cambridge.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Vauxhall Carlton#Mark I (1978\u201386)|Carlton Mark I Estate]], in production from 1978 to 1986.]]\nSimilarly, the Vauxhall brand was dropped by GM in Ireland in favour of the German brand Opel.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=KNITAQAAMAAJ&dq=%22Republic+of+Ireland%22+%22Opel%22&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=%22under+the+Opel+name%22 ''European Motor Business''], Issues 24-27, [[Economist Intelligence Unit]], 1991, page 112</ref> Other [[right hand drive|RHD]] markets such as [[Malta]] and [[Cyprus]] soon following. In New Zealand, the brand was withdrawn in favour of Holden after the demise of the Chevette. [[GM Europe]] then began to standardise model names across both brands in the early 1990s. The Vauxhall Astra and Opel Kadett, for example, were both called Astra from 1991 onwards and the Vauxhall Nova and Opel Corsa were both called Corsa from 1993. The change was completed in 1995 when the [[Vauxhall Cavalier]] Mk 3 (Opel Vectra A) was replaced by the Opel Vectra B, called [[Vauxhall Vectra]]. Apart from the VX220, sold by Opel as the Speedster, all of Vauxhall's subsequent models have had the same names as those of Opel. However, the 2015 Viva revives earlier practice due to its Opel equivalent, the Karl, intentionally invoking Karl Opel, the second proprietor of the Opel business. Despite this, the Adam, named after his father and the founder of the company, is sold in Britain without a name change, potentially as it appears less overtly German.\n\nFrom 1994, Vauxhall models differed from Opels in their distinctive grille \u2013 featuring a \"V\", incorporating the Vauxhall badge. This was also used by [[Holden]] in New Zealand on both the Astra and Vectra, by [[Chevrolet]] in Brazil on the Mk1 Chevrolet Astra (Opel Astra F)<ref>[http://www.oficinabrasil.com.br/noticia/do-fundo-do-bau/chevrolet-astra-gls-um-belga-naturalizado-brasileiro-que-chegou-disposto-a-enfrentar-os-alemaes-e-italianos Chevrolet Astra GLS, um belga naturalizado brasileiro que chegou disposto a enfrentar os alem\u00e3es e italianos], Oficina Brasil, 10 August 2015</ref> and on the Indian version of the Opel Astra.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adpost.com/in/vehicles/4015/|title=Opel Astra Club 1 6 L Patrol April 2001 model Car FOR SALE from Ghaziabad Delhi @ Adpost.com Classifieds > India > #4015 Opel Astra Club 1 6 L Patrol April 2001 model Car FOR SALE from Ghaziabad Delhi ,free,indian,classified ad,classified ads,secondhand,second hand|website=www.adpost.com|accessdate=28 June 2019}}</ref> The \"V\" badging was an echo of the fluted V-shaped bonnets that had been used in some form on all Vauxhall cars since the very first. The \"V\" grille was not, however, used on the Vectra-replacing [[Opel Insignia|Insignia]], unveiled in 2008 and the 2009 [[Opel Astra|Vauxhall Astra]] and the 2010 [[Opel Meriva|Vauxhall Meriva]]. All the above, plus the US Saturn brand up to its demise in 2009, used the same grille bar with the \"V\" almost entirely muted out. These bars all carried identical badge mounts, enabling brand badges to be readily interchangeable.  The Opel-badged versions in right-hand drive form still however find their way into the United Kingdom; either as [[grey import]]s from Ireland or Malta, or are sold as new from [[car supermarket]]s who have sourced Irish specification vehicles in bulk.\n\nA model unique to the Vauxhall range was the high-performance [[Vauxhall Monaro|Monaro]] [[coup\u00e9]], which was sourced from and designed by [[Holden]] in Australia. Although this model was also produced in [[left hand drive]] (LHD) for markets like the US (where it was known as the [[Pontiac GTO]]) and for the Middle East (as the [[Holden Monaro|Chevrolet Lumina Coupe]]), the model was not offered by Opel in mainland Europe. Imports of this vehicle were limited to 15,000 to avoid additional safety testing. Future vehicles that have been confirmed by Vauxhall, but not by Opel, are the [[Holden Commodore]] SSV and the [[HSV GTS]]. Vauxhall confirmed the importation of the GTS just after the reborn [[Opel GT]] roadster was announced as not being imported into the UK.\n\nThe bodywork for the [[Holden Camira]] estate was used for the [[Vauxhall Cavalier]] estate in the UK (though not for the identical [[Opel Ascona]] in the rest of Europe) \u2013 conversely the rear bodywork of the T-car [[Vauxhall Chevette]] estate and [[Bedford Chevanne]] van was used for the respective [[Holden Gemini]] versions. Vauxhall's compact car, the [[Vauxhall Viva (1963\u20131979)|Viva]], formed the basis of the first [[Holden Torana]] in Australia in the 1960s.\n\nMany cars badged as Opels, even LHD models, are produced by Vauxhall for export. Vauxhall has built some Holdens for export, too, notably Vectra-As to New Zealand and Astra-Bs to both Australia and New Zealand. {{citation needed|reason=Many more cars badged as Vauxhall were produced by Opel|date=December 2014}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

By marriage, he also gained the rights to an area near London, south of the [[Thames]]. The house he built, Fulk's Hall, became known in time as Vauxhall. Vauxhall Iron Works adopted this emblem from the coat of arms to emphasise its links to the local area. When Vauxhall Iron Works moved to Luton in 1905, the griffin emblem coincidentally returned to its ancestral home.\n\nThe logo as pictured used to be square, but it is now circular, to enable it to fit in the same recess designed for the circular Opel emblem. Since the 1920s, the griffin has been redesigned and released nine times. 2008 saw the release of a revised version of the 2005 logo. [[Bill Parfitt]], Chairman and managing director of GM UK, said, \"While the new-look Griffin pays homage to our 100-year-plus manufacturing heritage in the UK, it also encapsulates Vauxhall's fresh design philosophy, first showcased in the current Astra, and set to continue with Insignia.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vauxhall.co.uk/vaux/pages/experienceVauxhall/news/article.jsp?article=insignia_0009&category=insignia |title=Vauxhall's Griffin Flies to New Horizon |publisher=Vauxhall Motors |date=10 September 2009 |accessdate=10 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817130015/http://www.vauxhall.co.uk/vaux/pages/experienceVauxhall/news/article.jsp?article=insignia_0009&category=insignia |archivedate=17 August 2009 }}</ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:The Vauxhall Griffin from Vauxhall D-type (1920).JPG|The Vauxhall Griffin from Vauxhall D-type (1920)\nFile:Vauxhall badge - Flickr - foshie.jpg|A Vauxhall grillplate from the 1940s showing the Griffin logo\nFile:Vauxhall VX220 - Flickr - The Car Spy (8).jpg|Vauxhall Motors' logo from the 1990s to 2008\n</gallery>\n\n==Sponsorships==\nVauxhall Motors sponsored the [[Football Conference]], the highest non-league [[Football in England|division of English football]], from 1986 until 1998.

The [[Vauxhall Magnum|Magnum coupe]] was heavier and less powerful than the dominant [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]], but still put up some strong performances in the hands of drivers such as Will Sparrow and Brian Culcheth.  From 1976, Vauxhall decided to heighten their profile in the sport by building a [[homologation]]-special version of the [[Vauxhall Chevette]], known as the Chevette HS.  This was a much more serious contender, and in the hands of drivers such as [[Pentti Airikkala]], [[Tony Pond]], [[Russell Brookes]] and [[Jimmy McRae]] it and its successor version, the Chevette HSR, won many events in Britain and Europe.  Airikkala won the [[British Rally Championship]] in a Chevette in 1979.\n\nThe Chevette was retired in 1983, and effort was concentrated for the next few years on the [[Group B]] [[Opel Manta 400]].  However, the [[Vauxhall Astra]] and [[Vauxhall Nova]] were campaigned in the lower power classes during the mid-1980s, and became popular amateurs' cars thanks to their reliability, ease of tuning and ready supply of parts.  After the banning of [[Group B]] in 1986 the [[Group A]] Astra returned to the forefront.  As a two-litre, front-wheel-drive car it was unable to challenge the four-wheel-drive cars for outright victory, but did score top ten placings on several World Championship events.  [[Louise Aitken-Walker]] won the ladies' World Championship in 1990 in an Astra, despite a serious accident on that year's Rally of Portugal when her car rolled down a hillside and into a lake.\n\nDuring 1991\u201392 serious consideration was given to campaigning the four-wheel-drive version of the [[Vauxhall Calibra]] in British and possibly world rallies, and a trial version contested the 1993 Swedish Rally in the hands of [[Stig Blomqvist]].  However, the cost was judged prohibitive, and in any case the 'Formula 2' category had been introduced into British rallying.  The latest version of the Astra was an ideal contender, and won the category in the 1993 and 1994 championships, driven by [[David Llewellin]].  Vauxhall campaigned successive versions of the Astra in the British championship until the late 1990s.\n[[File:Tom Chilton 2007 BTCC Oulton Park.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tom Chilton]] driving for Vauxhall at the Oulton Park round of the [[2007 British Touring Car Championship season|2007 British Touring Car Championship]]]]\nVauxhall first entered the [[British Touring Car Championship]] with the [[Vauxhall Cavalier]] in 1989.  The lead driver was [[John Cleland (racing driver)|John Cleland]], who remained with the team until his retirement in 1999.  The Cavalier was competitive, and often the fastest front-wheel-drive car in the series, and Cleland was second in the title race in 1992, and then fourth in the following two years.  In 1995, however, he won the title (adding to his 1989 title win in an Astra).  The Cavalier was replaced by the Vectra for 1996.  [[Yvan Muller]] was sixth in the 1999 British Touring Car Championship and fourth in 2000.\n\nIn 2001 the [[British Touring Car Championship|BTCC]] regulations changed and Vauxhall brought the [[BTC-T Vauxhall Astra Coupe|Astra Coupe]] into the BTCC. The Astra would dominate the BTCC between 2001 and 2004 with the drivers title won by [[Jason Plato]] in 2001, [[James Thompson (racing driver)|James Thompson]] in 2002 \u2013 2004 and [[Yvan Muller]] in 2003. Vauxhall also won the Manufacturers Award and Teams Award every year also.\n\nIn 2005 the Astra Coupe was replaced by the [[BTC-T Vauxhall Astra Sport Hatch|Astra Sport Hatch]] however it was not as competitive as the Astra Coupe and restricted success for Vauxhall in 2005 and 2006.\n\nIn 2007 The regulations changed again and Vauxhall brought the Vectra back. The Vectra brought success back to Vauxhall after [[Fabrizio Giovanardi]] won the 2007 and 2008 BTCC championship. Fabrizio Giovanardi finished 3rd in the championship in 2009 before Vauxhall pulled sponsorship out at the end of 2009 due to and the economic crisis and lack of official manufacturers in the BTCC.\n[[File:BTCC 2001 Plato.jpg|thumb|[[Jason Plato]] driving a modified [[Vauxhall Astra]] in the 2001 [[British Touring Car Championship]]]]\nIn November 2016 it was announced that Vauxhall would return to the BTCC in partnership with Power Maxed Racing.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.btcccrazy.co.uk/btcc/vauxhall-to-make-btcc-return-with-power-maxed-racing/|title=Vauxhall makes BTCC return with Power Maxed Racing|accessdate=22 November 2016|publisher=BTCC CRAZY|date=22 November 2016}}</ref> It was later announced that former BTCC and WTCC driver [[Tom Chilton]] would lead the team with Senna Proctor as his teammate. The team earned a podium at their first meeting of the year at Brands Hatch, and their best finish was a 2nd at Silverstone, with Rob Huff standing in for Tom Chilton.\n\n2018 saw the team return as TAG Autosport with [[Power Maxed Racing]], with Senna Proctor this time teaming up with [[Josh Cook]]. The first round of the year saw [[Senna Proctor]] take both his and the Team's first win at Brands Hatch, as he made an incredible drive from P28 to take the chequered flag. Josh Cook followed at Donington just a few weeks later with a Pole Position and a Lights to Flag victory in the first race, followed by yet another podium in Race 3. Another win followed for Cook at the following round at Thruxton. Throughout the year the team managed another 10 podiums, and dropped no lower than 3rd in the Teams Standings for the entire season.

He joined Vauxhall in 1906 at the age of 22, as an assistant draughtsman. In the winter of 1907/8, the chief designer F. W. Hodges took a long holiday, and in his absence, the managing director Percy Kidner asked Pomeroy to design an [[internal combustion engine|engine]] for cars to be entered in the 1908 RAC and Scottish Reliability Trial, held in June that year. The cars were so successful that Pomeroy took over from Hodges.<ref name=Beaulieu>{{cite book|last=Georgano|first=N.  | authorlink=G. N. Georgano |title=Beaulieu Encyclopedia of the Automobile|year=2000|publisher=[[HMSO]] |isbn=1-57958-293-1}}</ref>\n\nPomeroy's first design, the Y-Type Y1, had outstanding success at the 1908 RAC and Scottish 2000 Mile Reliability Trials \u2013 showing excellent hill-climbing ability with an aggregate of 37 seconds less time in the hill climbs than any other car in its class. With unparalleled speeds around the [[Brooklands]] circuit, the Vauxhall was so far ahead of all other cars of any class that the driver could relax, accomplishing the {{convert|200|mi|km}} at an average speed of {{convert|46|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, when the car was capable of {{convert|55|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. The Y-Type went on to win class E of the trial.\n\nThe Y-Type was so successful that it was decided to put the car into production as the A09 car. This spawned the [[Vauxhall A-Type]]. Four distinct types of this were produced between 27 October 1908 and when mass production halted in 1914. One last A-Type was put together in 1920. Capable of up to {{convert|100|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, the A-Type Vauxhall was one of the most acclaimed three-litre cars of its day.\n\nTwo cars were entered in the 1910 Prince Henry Trials, and although not outright winners, performed well, and replicas were made for sale officially as the C-type, but now known as the [[Vauxhall Prince Henry|Prince Henry]]. During the First World War, Vauxhall made large numbers of the D-type, a Prince Henry chassis with derated engine, for use as [[staff car]]s for the British forces.\n\nAfter the 1918 armistice, the D-type remained in production, along with the sporting [[Vauxhall E-type|E-type]]. Pomeroy left in 1919, moving to the United States, and was replaced by C.E. King.<ref name=Beaulieu/> In spite of making good cars, expensive pedigree cars of the kind that had served the company well in the prosperous prewar years were no longer in demand;<ref name=Motor196811>{{cite magazine|author=Charles Bulmer (Ed)|title=Vauxhall Owners' Supplement: It started in 1857...|magazine=[[The Motor]]|volume=nbr 3466|pages=1\u201352|date=23 November 1968}}</ref> the company struggled to make a consistent profit and Vauxhall looked for a major strategic partner.\n\n===1925 to 1945===\n[[File:Vauxhall Light 6 1530cc Sep 1933.JPG|thumb|right|1933 Vauxhall Light Six. This was the first Vauxhall to sell in numbers comparable to rivals from the largest British car makers of the day.]]\nOn 16 November 1925, Vauxhall was acquired by [[General Motors Corporation]] for US$2.5&nbsp;million.<ref>Display advertisement: The Future of Vauxhall Motors by managing directors L Walton and PC Kidner. ''The Times'', Thursday, 26 November 1925; pg. 10; Issue 44129</ref> The company's image and target market were gently but firmly changed over the next five and more years, marked particularly by the introduction in late 1930 of the low-cost two-litre [[Vauxhall Cadet]] and the next year the first [[Bedford Vehicles|Bedford]] truck, which was [[Chevrolet]] based.<ref name=Motor196811/> Vauxhall's chief engineer since 1920, Charles Evelyn King,  retired as engineering director in 1950. The company's future chief engineer, Harold Drew, left Luton for a spell, working as a draughtsman with GM's [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]]-based [[Oldsmobile]] division.<ref name=Motor196811/> As the first significant post-acquisition passenger car, the Cadet, initially retailing at \u00a3280, is generally regarded as demonstrating Vauxhall's newly acquired interest and expertise in controlling production costs, but it was also the first British car to feature a [[synchromesh gearbox]].<ref name=Motor196811/>\n\nGeneral Motors continued to reposition Vauxhall towards the middle of the British car market, aiming to produce higher volumes of more conventional cars that, using GM's large engineering, design and production resources, would offer modern technology and high levels of equipment at a reasonable price with competitors being the likes of [[Wolseley Motors|Wolseley]], [[Humber Limited|Humber]] and the smaller [[Rover Company|Rovers]]. The Cadet had been the first step in this process, which gathered pace in June 1933 with the launch of the AS-type [[Vauxhall Light Six|Light Six]]. With an all-steel body and a refined and modern [[Overhead valve engine|overhead valve]] [[Straight-six engine|inline-six]] engine, the Light Six was produced in 12- and 14-[[Tax horsepower#Britain|'tax horsepower']] variants. Modernisation and expansion of the Luton factory meant that the Light Six was sold for \u00a3195 for the standard four-door saloon, which was significantly less than many of its older rivals with four-cylinder engines and less interior appointments, and Vauxhall made the unusual decision to offer both 12 and 14 models for the same price. Two-door saloon, coupe, tourer and cabriolet bodies were also available for extra cost, plus a range of other body designs from [[coachbuilder]]s. The Light Six was an immediate sale success, surpassing all previous Vauxhall products by a large margin with 26,000 examples being sold in just over 12 months and with the Luton factory moving onto 24-hour shift work to meet demand. Vauxhall had suddenly become a significant player in the British car market.\n\nAfter 15 months on sale the AS-type Light Six was replaced by the D-type Light Six. This was fundamentally the same as the outgoing model with minor styling and interior updates, but with one major engineering change - namely the addition of [[Dubonnet suspension]] to the front, making the new Light Six the first mass-production British saloon car with independent front suspension. The Dubonnet system was a GM patent, also used on [[Chevrolet]] and [[Pontiac]] models in the USA and on [[Opel]] cars in Europe. The D-type Light Six was priced at between \u00a3205 and \u00a3245 for the standard saloon depending on the exact specification, which was still a lower-than-average price for a car of the new Light Six's size, power, equipment and technical specification and this was another successful model for Vauxhall.\n[[File:1937_Vauxhall_H-type_Ten_1.2_Front.jpg|thumb|right|The 10-4 of 1937 was the first mass-production British unibody saloon car and was called \"The \u00a31 Million Motor Car\" after its costly and extensive development programme.]] \nThe overall strategy for Vauxhall continued to be to make smaller models with the latest engineering developments. Vauxhall and GM management planned a completely new three-model car range which would use cutting-edge [[Vehicle frame#Unibody|unibody]] construction instead of the traditional body-on-frame design. The first mass-production unibody car, the [[Citro\u00ebn Traction Avant]] began production in 1934, the same year that design work on the new Vauxhall range began. As well as designing an entirely new car body, this change required major expansion, renewal and investment in the Luton factory as well as a significant expansion of Vauxhall's engineering and design staff. The first of the new models was released in September 1937. This was the H-type [[Vauxhall 10-4|10-4]] (the model number referring to its 10 tax-horsepower, four-cylinder engine). This was the first truly small Vauxhall in many years. As well as its advanced unibody structure - a first for a British saloon car - the 10-4 also featured an overhead valve engine, fully hydraulic brakes and Dubonnet front suspension. Other features included a full-synchromesh gearbox, mechanical windscreen wipers and a 'six-stage' carburetor. Priced at \u00a3168-182, the 10-4 was only slightly more expensive than old-fashioned equivalents from [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]] and [[Morris Motors|Morris]] and cost around \u00a330 more than the cheapest 10-horsepower class car on sale, the [[Ford 7W]]. The model was promoted as \"The \u00a31 Million Motor Car\", reflecting the supposed investment in its design and production and was noted for its excellent fuel economy of over 40mpg when touring due to its efficient modern engine and lightweight body. The 10-4 was considered to be the finest small car in the world at the time of its launch and initial demand greatly exceeded production capacity. Just six months after the 10-4's launch, the 10,000th example left Luton - a production record for the Vauxhall at the time. The H-type 10-4 was only the first and smallest in the proposed trio of similarly advanced unibody cars. The I-type [[Vauxhall 12-4|12-4]] (essentially the same as the 10-4 but with a longer wheelbase and an enlarged engine) was introduced in September 1938 and the J-type [[Vauxhall 14-6|14-6]], replacing the old Light Six, was introduced the following month but sales did not begin until early 1939. This advanced three-model range was very well received by critics and buyers and placed Vauxhall in the vanguard of automotive engineering for the mass market in Britain. However the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in 1939 greatly restricted the sales of all new cars just as the new Vauxhall range was entering the market and production was reaching full flow. Car production was ceased entirely in May 1940, by which time over 50,000 10-4s, 10,000 12-4s and 15,000 14-6s had been built.\n\nDuring the Second World War, car production at Luton was suspended to allow Vauxhall to work on the new [[Churchill tank]]. Despite a bombing raid in August 1940, in which 39 employees were killed,<ref>Seymour, W.J. (1946). ''An Account of our Stewardship. Being a record of the war-time activities of Vauxhall motors Ltd.'' pp.90\u201394</ref> it was taken from specification to production in less than a year, and assembled there (as well as at other sites). More than 5,600 Churchill tanks were built. Luton also produced around 250,000 lorries for the war effort, alongside the new [[Bedford Dunstable plant]], which was opened in 1942, with Bedford designs being common in British use. As a morale booster for the company employees, on 23, 24, and 25 February 1944, [[Adelaide Hall]] appeared in concert at the factory in Luton, where she entertained the employees during their lunch break. In all, she performed in front of more than 10,000 workers; this was the first time that Vauxhall had contracted a star to perform at their factory for three consecutive days.<ref>[[Adelaide Hall]] performs at Vauxhall Factory in 1944: (retrieved 10 September 1014) http://www.wartimememories.co.uk/women.html</ref>\n[[File:Churchill IV.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Churchill tank|Mk IV Churchill tank (75mm)]], of which 7,368 were manufactured by Vauxhall between 1941 and 1945]]\n\n===1945 to 1970===\n[[File:Vauxhall_Wyvern_ca_1949_at_Weston_Park.JPG|right|thumb|The L-Type Wyvern was the first new post-war Vauxhall and was essentially a reskin of the pre-war 10-4.]]\nVauxhall was one of the first British car makers to switch from wartime to civilian production, mostly due to the ease with which [[Bedford Vehicles|Bedford]] trucks in production for military use could be redirected to the civilian market. The first post-war civilian trucks were made a few days before [[Victory over Japan Day|VJ Day]] in August 1945, with Vauxhall car production resuming in September. These initial models were essentially unchanged from the three-model range (H-, I-, and J-type unibody designs) that had been launched just before the outbreak of war in 1939. However, they were now renamed simply as the Vauxhall Ten, Twelve and Fourteen respectively, were each available in a single body and specification (four-door saloons to what had been the Deluxe trim level) to ease production and had minor internal and external trim differences to account for shortages or extra costs of various materials. Government regulations of the time meant that 75% of production had to be sent for export, so very few of these revived models reached buyers in the United Kingdom. Further rationalisation occurred in 1946 when the Twelve ceased to be a distinct model and now shared the body of the Ten but with the larger-capacity engine.\n\nThese models were superseded by 'new' cars in 1948. GM management had dictated that Luton should only utilise a single body design in order to maximise productivity and reduce supply costs. The British government had also revoked the RAC [[tax horsepower|taxable horsepower]] system and replaced it with a flat charge per vehicle regardless of engine size. This meant that there was no longer such an imperative to offer similar models with different engine capacities to fit in the different bands of the old tax system. Therefore, the new 1948 L-Type Vauxhalls consisted of just a pair of models, both using the body structure, floorpan and many running gear parts of the H-type/Ten model. However Vauxhall's director of styling, David Jones, managed to fit brand new exterior panels to the front, rear and rear-quarters of the old body centre-section to give the L-type a modern look which shared its basic shape and features with GM's [[Chevrolet Fleetline]] of the same year, albeit at a much smaller scale. The new models were the [[Vauxhall Wyvern#Wyvern LIX (1948\u201351)|Wyvern]] (using the four-cylinder engine previously used in the Twelve) and the [[Vauxhall Velox#Velox LIP & LBP (1948\u201351)|Velox]] using a new wide-bore development of the six-cylinder engine from the Fourteen. Otherwise, the L-Types reused the three-speed transmission (albeit with a switch to a [[Manual transmission#Column-mounted shifter|column gear change]], hydraulic brakes and Dubonnet suspension of the pre-war models essentially unchanged. Those predecessors had been advanced for their time so the Wyvern and Velox were still competitive despite being considered small and cramped alongside the likes of the [[Morris Minor]] and [[Austin A40 Devon]]. The Velox especially, with its smooth and powerful engine in a relatively small car, offered strong performance and good reliability to compete against the V8-powered [[Ford Pilot]].\n\n[[File:Vauxhall Wyvern 1507cc registered September 1952.JPG|right|thumb|The E-Type Vauxhalls (this is a Wyvern) used a brand new body and were much larger and more refined than their predecessors.]]\nThe L-Types were replaced by a truly new model, the E-Types, in 1951 with the new cars having been in development since 1948. GM was still restricting Vauxhall to a one-body policy and the range still consisted of two models differentiated mostly by their engines - the four-cylinder [[Vauxhall Wyvern#Wyvern EIX (1951\u201357)|EIX Wyvern]] and the six-cylinder [[Vauxhall Velox#Velox LIP & LBP (1948\u201351)|EIP Velox]]. While they were designed at Luton they drew a lot of influence from styling developments made in [[Detroit]], especially the revised 1951-model year [[Chevrolet]]s. The E-Types continued the use of unibody construction, but of a brand new and much larger design with full-width '[[Ponton (car)|pontoon]]' styling. They offered significantly more cabin and luggage space and a great deal of effort was put into both the styling of the interior and the reduction of vibration and noise. The complicated Dubonnet suspension system was replaced by more conventional design using coil springs and twin wishbones with telescopic dampers, while the rear axle retained leaf springs but also with the addition of telescopic dampers. The transmission and steering remained little-changed from the existing design. Vauxhall planned and developed a new range of short-stroke overhead-valve engines for the E-Types but financial and production constraints meant that the first new Wyverns and Veloxes were launched with the same engines as the outgoing L-Type. In the bigger, heavier E-Type models these gave very poor performance, especially the Wyvern with an engine all-but unchanged since 1937. The new engines, both slightly larger than the existing design, were fitted to both models during 1952 and brought performance up to a competitive level. In terms of price and production the E-Type Vauxhalls were now full contenders in the mid-size car market in Britain, alongside the likes of the [[Ford Consul EOTA (1951\u20131956)|Ford Consul]]/[[Ford Zephyr#Zephyr Six (or Zephyr Mark I)|Zephyr]], the [[Austin Cambridge#A50 Cambridge|Austin Cambridge]] and especially the increasingly old-fashioned [[Hillman Minx#Minx Mark I to VIII (1945\u201357)|Hillman Minx]]. By 1953 Vauxhall was building 110,000 E-Type models at Luton per year, with around half of production going to export - mostly in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] markets which still maintained preferential tariffs for British-made products. For 1955, the E-Type Vauxhalls received a facelift with new frontal and interior styling and minor mechanical refinements. Most importantly, Vauxhall returned to offering three car models (albeit all still sharing a single body design) with the addition of the [[Vauxhall Cresta|Cresta]], which was a more luxuriously-styled and appointed version of the Velox. Following GM practice from America, from this point Vauxhall began offering annual minor updates, improvements and styling changes to its cars to both keep up with competitors and to tempt existing owners to replace their car.\n\nSince the restarting of car production in 1945 the limiting factor for Vauxhall sales had been production, sometimes leading to lengthy waiting lists for customers. While the Luton factory had been expanded and modernised in the early 1950s, the main restriction was the lack of capacity for building the unitary bodyshells. Expansion of the body shop would require large investment that GM was reluctant to release and this was the main reason for Vauxhall relying on a single body design across three distinct models. In 1954 GM management sanctioned a switch to a two-body line-up at Vauxhall with concurrent investment to expand both the body shop and production lines at Luton. The new model would replace the four-cylinder Wyvern with a smaller car using the same engine, bringing Vauxhall into line with the established norm for cars in the 1.5-litre class - the E-Type Wyvern was a significantly larger car than its direct competitors. The new car would be launched for 1957 alongside new Velox/Cresta models which could, correspondingly, be slightly enlarged since their body no longer had to be shared with a model in the class below.\n\nThe small model, named the [[Vauxhall Victor#F Series Victor|F-Type Victor]] was announced first in February 1957. Although its engineering followed familiar Vauxhall lines - a unitary structure, independent front suspension with coil springs, a leaf-sprung live rear axle and a 1.5-litre four-cylinder overhead valve engine with a three-speed manual transmission with column-mounted change - it was, by necessity, virtually all brand new. The drivetrain was largely lifted from the outgoing E-Type Wyvern, but the engine received a higher [[compression ratio]] and updated carburation to account for the new widespread availability of [[Octane rating|high octane]] fuel and so made more power. Stylistically the Victor followed the familiar Vauxhall trend of following American styling trends, although the Victor took this to a new level by closely resembling the famous [[Chevrolet Bel Air#Second generation (1955\u20131957)|1955 Chevrolet Bel Air]], complete with [[Car tailfin|tailfins]], prominent 'flutes' on the bonnet (a modern evocation of a familiar Vauxhall styling cue dating back to the 1920s), wrap-around front and rear screens, large chromed bumpers and an exhaust tailpipe integrated into one of the rear overriders. A year after launch the Victor would also provide the basis for Vauxhall's first factory-built [[estate car]].\n\nThe new P-Type Velox/Cresta models were announced in October 1957. Like the Victor these essentially featured updated versions of the drivetrain (and running gear) from the E-Type models in a new, larger and much more flamboyantly-styled body. American styling cues were again much in evidence, this time being heavily influenced by a 1954 [[Cadillac]] [[concept car]] called the Park Avenue.\n\nBoth the new Vauxhall models continued the success of their predecessors. The Victor achieved new sales records for Vauxhall and in the late 1950s was Britain's most exported car, being sold in most right-hand drive car markets such as Australia, [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Thailand]] and [[Singapore]]. The model was also sold in left-hand drive form by General Motors in [[Canada]] (under the specially-created [[Envoy (automobile)|Envoy]] name and under the original Vauxhall Victor name through [[Pontiac]] dealerships in the USA. Nearly 400,000 F-Type Victors were built at Luton between the start of 1957 and the end of production in mid-1961. With the Victor taking the place of many previous Wyvern sales, the P-Type models did not sell in the same quantities as the entire E-Type range had, but over 180,000 were built between October 1957 and July 1962 with over 100,000 of those cars being exported. Both the Victor and the Velox/Cresta received criticism for their overtly American styling, which many reviewers saw as gaudy against more conservative British tastes. Both models had their styling revised in 1959 to remove some of the more extreme styling details. Both models also quickly developed a reputation for rapid and severe structural corrosion. The F-Type Victor was especially badly affected by this issue, caused by a combination of thin-gauge steel to minimise weight, numerous moisture traps in its body design (for instance the hidden tailpipe design encouraged corrosive exhaust gases and condensation to collect in the rear wing corners), the fitting of a plasticised underseal treatment to the floorpan which served to trap moisture and dirt once it became chipped or cracked and the fact that the Victor was built in quantities and rates that the Luton plant had not previously dealt with.\n\n[[File:En Vauxhall bliver demonstreret af s\u00e6lgeren (5883732955).jpg|right|thumb|A buyer and seller looking under the bonnet of a Vauxhall at a dealership in Denmark in the 1950s]]\nA manufacturing plant at [[Ellesmere Port]], Cheshire, was opened in 1962, initially making components to supply to the production lines in Luton, before passenger-car production began there in 1964.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.factorytour.co.uk/ellesmereport/ |title=Ellesmere Port car factory- Vauxhall, Opel |publisher=Factorytour.co.uk |accessdate=23 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314155901/http://www.factorytour.co.uk/ellesmereport/ |archivedate=14 March 2012  }}</ref>\n\nIn 1963, production of the [[Vauxhall Viva (1963\u20131979)|Vauxhall Viva]] small family car commenced, with the new car being aimed at the likes of the [[Ford Anglia]] and [[Morris Minor]]. The German version of the car was sold as the [[Opel Kadett]]. The locally assembled Vauxhall Viva was launched in Australia in May 1964. In 1966, Vauxhall's [[Vauxhall Slant-4 engine|Slant Four]] went into production \u2013 the first production [[overhead camshaft]] [[inline-four engine]] to use a rubber [[timing belt (camshaft)|timing belt]]. Also, the FD Victor was launched at the [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earls Court]] [[British International Motor Show#1966|Motor Show]], considered by many to be one of Vauxhall's finest all-British styling efforts.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Vauxhall acquired a reputation for making rust-prone models. The corrosion protection built into models was tightened up significantly, but the reputation dogged the company until at least the early 1980s.\n\nIn 1967, Vauxhall became a Royal Warrant Holder: Motor Vehicle Manufacturers to HM The Queen \u2013 the Royal Mews. The warrant of HRH The Prince of Wales was added in 1994.\n\nBy the late 1960s, the company was achieving five-figure sales on its most popular models, including the entry-level Viva and larger [[Vauxhall Victor|Victor]].\n\n===1970 to 1990===\nIn 1970, the HC Viva was launched, which went on to become Vauxhall's best-selling car of the decade, featuring among the 10 best-selling cars in Britain each year until after 1976, with production not finishing until 1979, when the Viva nameplate was finally discontinued after 16 years and three generations. In 1973, the [[Vauxhall Firenza|Vauxhall Firenza \"Droopsnoot\"]] coupe was unveiled at the Earls Court Motor Show, introducing the public to Vauxhall's new aerodynamic look for all of its subsequent 1970s models.\n\nBy 1973, the Victor was losing sales in a market that was becoming increasingly dominated by the [[Ford Cortina]]. This was not enough to keep Vauxhall from being well behind market leaders [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[British Leyland]] in sales, and most of its range was struggling even to keep pace with [[Chrysler Europe|Chrysler UK]] (formerly the [[Rootes Group]]).\n[[File:Vauxhall Cavalier first iteration Brecon.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Vauxhall Cavalier#Mark I (1975\u201381)|Cavalier Mark I]], in production from 1975 to 1981]]\n\nVauxhall's sales began to increase from 1975, with the launch of two important new models, the [[Vauxhall Chevette|Chevette]], a small three-[[vehicle door|door]] [[hatchback]] that was the first car of its kind to be built in Britain, and the [[Vauxhall Cavalier#Mk1|Cavalier]], a stylish four-door [[sedan (automobile)|saloon]] designed to compete head-to-head with the all-conquering Ford Cortina. A two-door coupe and three-door \"sport hatch\" had joined the Cavalier range by 1978, but there never was an estate version. The Cavalier helped Vauxhall regain lost ground in this crucial sector of the market, while the Chevette proved to be hugely popular in the growing supermini sector, as more buyers turned to smaller cars following the oil crisis of 1973. The Chevette range later evolved into a three-door estate, as well as saloons with two or four doors.\nBoth models were based on models produced by Opel, GM's German subsidiary, the Chevette being based on the [[Opel Kadett]], but with a distinct front end. Along with the [[Chevrolet Chevette]] in the US and Canada, the Chevette and Kadett were built on [[GM T platform (1973)|GM's T-Car platform]]. Similarly, the Cavalier was based on the [[Opel Ascona]], but featured the front end of the [[Opel Manta|Manta]], as did the [[Chevrolet Chevair]] in [[South Africa]]. These models were built on the [[GM J platform]].\n\nThis marked the end of a long and gradual process by GM to consolidate its two European subsidiaries with preference for the larger, and in terms of both absolute sales and market share, more successful Opel. Since the early 1960s, Vauxhalls, whilst being designed and built in the United Kingdom, increasingly shared their general specification, engineering features, and styling with Opel counterparts (the Viva with the Kadett and the Victor with the [[Opel Rekord|Rekord]], for instance) even if the two cars were distinct, with few to any interchangeable parts. From the late 1960s and into the early 1970s, increasing economic turmoil in the UK, declining build quality, and increasing [[strike action]] throughout British industry (and in stark contrast, the ''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]'' or economic miracle of [[West Germany]] during the same period), plus the entry of the UK into the [[European Economic Community]] in 1973, made maintaining two parallel model lines serving similar markets increasingly undesirable. The [[Vauxhall Victor#FE Series Victor, VX4/90, Ventora, VX1800 and VX2|FE Series Victor]], launched in 1972, would be the last all-British Vauxhall. Following the introduction of the Chevette and Cavalier, virtually all future Vauxhalls would be lightly restyled Opels (the exceptions would be based on models from elsewhere in the GM organisation). However, Vauxhall retained its two British factories at Luton and Ellesmere Port, with most cars wearing the Vauxhall badge still being built in the UK.\n\nThe introduction of the Opel-based Vauxhalls marked a significant improvement in both the design and build quality of Vauxhall cars, which were now considered strong rivals to their Ford competitors. By the end of the 1970s, Vauxhall had boosted its market share substantially, and was fast closing in on Ford and British Leyland.\n\nIn 1978, Vauxhall strengthened its position in the [[executive car]] market with the launch of its all-new [[Vauxhall Carlton|Carlton]] saloon and estate, which were facelifted versions of the German-built [[Opel Rekord Series E|Opel Rekord]]. A year later, a more upmarket saloon model, the [[Opel Senator|Senator]], was launched under the Opel brand, and finally became available as a Vauxhall from 1983.\n\nBy 1979, Vauxhall had increased its market share substantially; it was still some way behind Ford and British Leyland, but had overtaken [[Talbot]] (the [[Peugeot]]-owned successor to [[Rootes Group|Rootes]] and [[Chrysler Europe|Chrysler UK]]).\n\n[[File:Vauxhall Astra Mk I Clare.jpg|thumb|right|The Vauxhall Astra Mk I, in production from 1979 to 1984]]\nEarly in 1980, Vauxhall moved into the modern family hatchback market with its [[Vauxhall Astra|Astra]] range that replaced the aging Viva, and quickly became popular with buyers. The Astra was a rebadged version of the first front-wheel drive Opel Kadett, which had been launched in 1979, and was sold alongside the Astra for several years.\n\nIn 1981, the company released the [[Vauxhall Cavalier#Mk2|Mk2 Cavalier]], the first Vauxhall of this size to offer [[front-wheel drive]] and a hatchback bodystyle. Built at the Luton plant, it really boosted Vauxhall's fortunes, with the Cavalier's sales for 1982 almost trebling its total for 1981, and peaking at more than 130,000 by 1984. During that time, sales of the Vauxhall brand more than doubled.  This was complemented in 1983 with an [[station wagon|estate]], based on the [[Holden Camira|Camira]] produced in [[Australia]] by [[Holden]], with the tailgates for the Vauxhall version being built there and shipped to Luton. It was Britain's second-best selling car in 1984 and 1985, and spent most of its production life vying with the [[Ford Sierra]] for top place in the large family car market. The Cavalier was relaunched in 1988, an all-new format that won praise for its sleek looks and much-improved resistance to rust.\n\nApril 1983 had the launch of the [[Opel Corsa|Nova]] supermini, a rebadged version of the [[Spain|Spanish]]-built Opel Corsa. The new entry-level model in the Vauxhall range, it was available as a hatchback or a saloon and was solely built at the Zaragoza plant in Spain. This completed Vauxhall's regeneration, and by the end of the 1980s, it had overtaken [[Austin Rover]] (formerly British Leyland) as Britain's second-most popular carmaker. The arrival of the Nova also spelled the end of the Chevette in 1984 after nearly a decade in production.\n\nThe Astra further strengthened its position in the market with an all-new model in the autumn of 1984, featuring an aerodynamic design reminiscent of Ford's larger Sierra.\n[[File:Vauxhall Carlton JRHospital cropped.jpg|thumb|right|The Vauxhall Carlton Mark I]]\nIn 1984, the aerodynamically styled Vauxhall Astra Mk2 built at the Ellesmere Port Plant became the first Vauxhall car to be elected [[European Car of the Year]]. From the spring of 1985, the Vauxhall Nova was also available as a four-door saloon and five-door hatchback.\n\nIn January 1986, Vauxhall launched the [[Vauxhall Belmont|Belmont]], a saloon version of the Astra, which offered more interior space and was almost as big as a Cavalier. However, this car failed to reach Vauxhall's expectations in terms of sales, and from 1989 was rebadged the Astra Belmont.\n\nVauxhall won another \"European Car of the Year\" award with its all-new [[Vauxhall Carlton]], a rebadged Opel-built vehicle and badged Opel Omega in the rest of Europe, sealing the award for 1987. A year after the launch of the MK2 Carlton, Vauxhall revitalised its flagship Senator to create a new-generation luxury saloon.\n\nThe Luton-built [[Vauxhall Cavalier#Mk3|Cavalier (Mk3)]] (sold as the [[Opel Vectra]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and mainland Europe) entered its third generation in 1988 with an all-new sleek design that further enhanced its popularity. The [[Opel Calibra|Calibra]] [[coup\u00e9]] followed in 1989, which was officially the most aerodynamic production car in the world on its launch. Falling between the Cavalier and Senator was the Opel-built [[Vauxhall Carlton|Carlton]] (Opel Rekord and later [[Opel Omega]] elsewhere) \u2013 relaunched in 1986, and was voted [[European Car of the Year]], a large four-door family saloon. The two sports versions of the Carlton were the 3000&nbsp;GSi and the [[Lotus Carlton]], the latter being aimed at family-minded executives, and at {{convert|175|mi/h|km/h}}, considered the fastest four-door production car at the time. Most importantly, the latest generation of Vauxhall models dispelled the image of rusting cars that had for so long put potential buyers off the Vauxhall brand, and given it a strong competitor in all the major market sectors, whereas during the first half of the 1970s, only the Viva was a serious threat to any of its key rivals.\n\nAt the end of the 1970s, General Motors had decided to restrict the Opel brand on the UK market to sporting models, and with the success and wide range choice of the new Vauxhall products of the early 1980s, the Manta was the only Opel-badged car being imported to the UK by the end of 1984. When the Manta was finally discontinued in 1988, Opel models were no longer officially imported to the UK. Its successor, the Calibra, was badged as a Vauxhall on the UK market.\n\nBy 1990, Vauxhall was preparing to launch the MK3 Astra, and its first 4X4 off-road vehicle, while a replacement for the Nova was also in development.\n\n===1990 to 2000===\n[[File:VauxhallGriffinHouse.jpg|thumb|235px|Griffin House became the Vauxhall headquarters building in 1991. It had previously been the design and testing building.]]\nIn 1991, Vauxhall's corporate headquarters were moved to Griffin House, formerly the company's design and testing building.<ref>{{cite book |title=General Motors in the 20th century|first1=James |last1=Bush |first2=Alan |last2=Binder |first3=Deebe |last3=Ferris| publisher=Ward's Communications |year=2000 |page=170 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gsXhAAAAMAAJ&q=General+Motors+in+the+20th+century&dq=General+Motors+in+the+20th+century&hl=en&sa=X&ei=BK1fT_vlMuuV0QW5na38Bg&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA |accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref> In the same year, the third-generation Vauxhall Astra went on sale (with Opel versions adopting the Astra nameplate for the first time) and the saloon version badged Astra rather than Belmont. Vauxhall joined forces with [[Isuzu]] to produce the [[Opel Frontera|Frontera]], a [[four-wheel drive]] off-roader available in short- and long-wheelbase versions.\n\nIn 1993, the [[Vauxhall Cavalier|Cavalier]] was firmly re-established as Britain's most popular large family car, with more than 130,000 sales, while the third-generation [[Vauxhall Astra|Astra]] (relaunched in 1991) with 100,000 sales was continuing to narrow the gap between itself and the best-selling [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]]. The Astra was now joined by the Belmont, a four-door booted version of the Astra. This continued for some time until being renamed Astra, presumably to provide combined sales/registration figures. The decade-old Nova was axed in 1993, in favour of the all-new [[Opel Corsa|Corsa]], adopting the European naming of the model; its distinctive styling and practical interior began attracting more sales than its predecessor had done.\n\nIn 1994, GM ceased production of Bedford Vehicles because their profits were decreasing over time. Bedford Vehicles had been Vauxhall's commercial vehicle arm, making successful vans, trucks, and lorries since the 1930s.  The last \"true\" Bedford light commercials \u2013 the [[Bedford HA]] and [[Bedford CF]] panel vans \u2013 had already ceased production in 1983 and 1987, respectively, and had been replaced by licence-built versions of Isuzu and Suzuki vans such as the [[Isuzu Fargo|Midi]] and [[Suzuki Carry|Rascal]].  Production of these models continued at Luton, now badged Vauxhall, but built by a separate company named IBC ('''I'''suzu-'''B'''edford '''C'''ommercials).  Also in 1994, the Vauxhall Carlton nameplate was abandoned after 16 years, and [[Vauxhall Omega|Omega]] took its place, becoming the first model to feature the new corporate \"V\" grille. Vauxhall also added another vehicle to its four-wheel drive line-up in the shape of the Isuzu-based [[Vauxhall Monterey|Monterey]]. Vauxhall joined the expanding \"compact coup\u00e9\" market with its new Corsa-based [[Vauxhall Tigra|Tigra]] model.\n\nThe Cavalier nameplate was axed in 1995 after 20 years, a full model after Opel had dropped its Ascona nameplate, Vauxhall adopting the common [[Opel Vectra#Vectra B|Vectra]] nameplate for its successor, completing a policy by [[General Motors]] that aligned and identically badged all Vauxhall and Opel models. Vectra received disappointing feedback from the motoring public, and several well-known journalists, most notably [[Jeremy Clarkson]], yet it was still hugely popular, and for a while after the 1999 facelift, it was actually more popular than Ford's highly acclaimed [[Ford Mondeo|Mondeo]]. In 1996, Vauxhall launched the short-lived [[Vauxhall Sintra|Sintra]] large MPV. The Astra entered its fourth generation in 1998, and offered levels of build quality and handling that were better than all of its predecessors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisebuyers.co.uk/motoring/car-reviews/Vauxhall/Astra+%281998-04%29/1111/|title=Reviews \u2013 Vauxhall|publisher=WiseBuyer's Guides|accessdate=10 September 2009}}</ref>\n[[File:1995 Vauxhall Omega 2.5 TD GLS Estate (15681465168).jpg|thumb|right|A 1995 Vauxhall Omega 2.5 TD GLS Estate]]\nIn 1999, the seven-seater [[compact MPV]] [[Vauxhall Zafira|Zafira]], based on the Astra chassis, went on sale and the Vauxhall Monterey was withdrawn from sale in the UK, although it continued to sell in the rest of Europe as an Opel.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Vauxhall received criticism in several high-profile car surveys. In 1998, a ''[[Top Gear (1977 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' customer-satisfaction survey condemned the [[Opel Vectra|Vauxhall Vectra]] as the least satisfying car to own in Britain. A year later, the Vauxhall marque was ranked last by the same magazine's customer-satisfaction survey. The Vauxhall range received particular criticism for breakdowns, build-quality problems, and many other maladies, which meant that quality did not reflect sales success. Nevertheless, Vauxhall was competing strongly in the sales charts, and by 1999 was closer to Ford in terms of sales figures than it had been in years.\n\n===2000 to 2010===\nIn 2000, Vauxhall entered the sports car market with the [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]]-based [[Vauxhall VX220|VX220]] roadster. It re-entered the coup\u00e9 market with the Astra Coup\u00e9. The new [[Opel Agila|Agila]] city car and a second-generation  [[Vauxhall Corsa|Corsa]] supermini also went on sale. On 12 December 2000, Vauxhall announced that car production at its Luton plant would cease in 2002, with the final vehicle being made in March 2002 following the end of production of the Vectra B and production of its replacement moving to Ellesmere Port alongside the Astra. Manufacture of vans (sold under the Vauxhall, Opel, [[Renault]], and [[Nissan]] badges throughout Europe) continued at the [[IBC Vehicles]] plant in Luton. On 17 May 2006, Vauxhall announced the loss of 900 jobs from Ellesmere Port's 3,000 staff, part of significant worldwide staff reductions by GM.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4988616.stm|title=Business &#124; Vauxhall confirms 900 job losses|work=BBC News |date=17 May 2006|accessdate=1 June 2009}}</ref>\n[[File:2006 Vauxhall Astra Life CDTi 90 1.2 Front.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Vauxhall Astra#Vauxhall Astra Mark 5|Astra Mark V]], in production from 2004 to 2009]]\n[[File:2007 Vauxhall Vectra Exclusive CDTi 150 Automatic 2.0 Front.jpg|thumb|right|The Vauxhall Vectra Mark II, in production from 2002 to 2008]]\n[[File:Vauxhall Vehicles on forecourt.jpg|thumb|right|[[Vauxhall Corsa]]s on sale at a former dealership in [[Wetherby]], [[West Yorkshire]]]]\n\nIn 2002, the all-new Vectra went on sale, alongside a large hatchback badged as the [[Vauxhall Signum|Signum]], which arrived the following year. The year 2002 was one of the best ever for Vauxhall sales in the UK. The Corsa was Britain's second-most popular new car, and gave the marque top spot in the British supermini car sales charts for the first time. The Astra was Britain's third-best selling car that year, while the [[Vauxhall Vectra|Vectra]] and the Zafira (a [[compact MPV]] launched in 1999) were just outside the top 10. The second-generation Vectra was launched in 2002 and was further improved over earlier Vectras, but was still hardly a class-leader, and now had to be content with lower sales due to a fall in popularity of D-sector cars, although a facelift in 2005 sparked a rise in sales.\n\nIn 2003, Vauxhall Omega production ended after nine years, with no direct replacement, while the [[Vauxhall Meriva|Meriva]] mini-MPV was launched. Perhaps the most important Vauxhall product of the 2000s so far is the fifth-generation Astra, launched in early 2004, and praised by the motoring press for its dramatic styling. It was an instant hit with British buyers, and was the nation's second-best selling car in 2005 and 2006, giving the [[Ford Focus (international)|Ford Focus]] its strongest competitor yet. Many police forces across the United Kingdom adopted the Astra as the standard patrol vehicle ([[panda car]]). Also in 2004, production of the Frontera ended after 13 years, with no direct replacement.\n\nIn 2006, the third generation of the Vauxhall Corsa went on sale, after having its world premier launch at the [[British International Motor Show#2006|2006 British International Motor Show]] at [[ExCeL London]]. The second-generation Corsa had been Britain's most popular supermini for most of its production life, but by 2006, it had started to fall behind the best of its competitors, so an all-new model was launched. This Corsa sold far better than either of the previous Corsas, and it was an instant hit with buyers. Also in 2006, the second-generation Zafira was the 10th-best selling car in the UK, the first time that an MPV had featured in the top 10 in Britain.\n\nIn 2007, Vauxhall's new 4x4, the [[Vauxhall Antara]], was released in July. Vauxhall's powerful [[HSV Clubsport|VXR8]] that came with {{convert|306|kW|PS bhp|0|lk=on}} was also introduced.\n\nIn 2008, Vauxhall began rebranding with a modified corporate logo. The [[Vauxhall Insignia]] was launched at the [[British International Motor Show#2008|2008 British International Motor Show]] at ExCeL London, replacing the Vectra and won another \"European Car of the Year\". Vauxhall launched the new Agila city car.\n\nIn 2009, a new generation of the Vauxhall Astra was launched.\n\nOn 30 May 2009, a deal was announced that was to lead to the spin-off of the Vauxhall and Opel brands into a new company. On 1 June 2009, Vauxhall Motors' troubled parent company, General Motors, filed for bankruptcy in a court in New York. By then, the sale of Vauxhall and its German sister subsidiary, Opel, was being negotiated as part of a strategy driven by the German government to ring fence the businesses from any General Motors asset liquidation.<ref name=\"Bloomberg-Sandler-et al-2009-06-01\">{{cite news|date=1 June 2009|accessdate=1 June 2009|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a4brqCWwvYXY|title=GM Files Bankruptcy to Spin Off More Competitive Firm (Update4)|publisher=Bloomberg LP|first=Linda|last=Sandler|author2=Chris Scinta|author3=Bob Van Voris|author4=Jeff Green|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205223206/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a4brqCWwvYXY|archivedate=5 December 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-Sanger-Zeleny-Vlasic-2009-05-31\">{{cite news|last=Sanger|first=David E. |author2=Jeff Zeleny |author3=Bill Vlasic|work=New York Times|title=G.M. to Seek Bankruptcy and a New Start: A Risky Bet to Save an Icon of American Capitalism|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/01/business/01auto.html|date=31 May 2009|accessdate=1 June 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-Sanger-2009-05-31\">{{cite news|title=G.M. to Seek Bankruptcy and a New Start|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/01/business/01auto.html|last=Sanger|first=David E.|work=New York Times|date=31 May 2009|accessdate=1 June 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"NYT-Maynard-2009-05-29\">{{cite news|title=After 93 Years, G.M.

These vehicles are high-performance machines, and are ideally aimed for younger buyers. Vauxhall unveiled a new model based on the Australian [[HSV Maloo]] at the 2005 [[National Exhibition Centre]] motor show in [[Birmingham]], England. It was claimed that the monstrous V8 Ute had a top speed around {{convert|200|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} \u2013 which is extremely fast for a [[utility vehicle]]. However, the model never got to the showroom in the United Kingdom. The Monaro (two-door design) is also no longer made, but a new version (a four-door saloon) is now on sale as the VXR8. The VXR8 is based on Australia's [[HSV Clubsport R8]]. This car reaches 0\u201360 in 5 seconds, in similar territory to other muscle car contemporaries such as the [[Dodge Viper|Dodge Viper (SRT-10)]] and [[Corvette Z06 (disambiguation)|Corvette Z06]] \u2013 and marginally slower than the [[FPV FG F6|Ford Performance Vehicles (FPV) FG F6]].

production from 1975 to 1984]]\nGeneral Motors began to merge the product lines of Vauxhall and Opel in the early 1970s, largely in favour of Opel products. The 1963 [[Vauxhall Viva|HA Viva]] was developed under some secrecy and exhibited remarkable similarities with the [[Opel Kadett A|Opel Kadett]] released a year previously, while the 1972 [[Vauxhall Victor|FE Victor]] was essentially the first overt exponent of this strategy, sharing its platform and several body fittings with the [[Opel Rekord|Opel Rekord D]], although it still retained Vauxhall-designed running gear and had no interchangeable body panels. 1975 saw the release of both the [[Vauxhall Chevette]], (a reworked [[Opel Kadett C|Opel Kadett]] featuring 'Droopsnoot' styling and an initially unique hatchback bodystyle option), and the [[Vauxhall Cavalier|Cavalier]], a similarly restyled [[Opel Ascona|Ascona]]. By the end of the 1970s most Vauxhalls were based on Opel designs.

The original [[Vauxhall Astra|Astra]], launched in 1980, set the eventual precedent for all GM Europe vehicles from that point onward \u2013 apart from the badging it had no styling or engineering difference from its Opel sister \u2013 the Kadett D. In the late '70s and early '80s, GM dealers in Ireland and in the United Kingdom sold highly similar Opel and Vauxhall models alongside each other. This policy of duplication was phased out when the Vauxhall and Opel dealer networks were merged and rebranded as Vauxhall-Opel in 1982, and most of the Opel range was discontinued in the United Kingdom in favour of their Vauxhall badged equivalents.  Opel was instead repositioned as a performance-luxury brand \u2013 the [[Opel Manta]] coup\u00e9 remained, whilst the [[Vauxhall Royale]] was replaced in the line-up by its Opel equivalent (the [[Opel Senator|Senator]]/[[Opel Monza|Monza]]).  However, this strategy was gradually abandoned \u2013 the Senator reverted to being badged as a Vauxhall for the 1985 model year, and the Opel Monza disappeared at the end of 1987, whilst the Manta was withdrawn in 1988.\n[[File:Vauxhall Carlton Caravan in Cambridge.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Vauxhall Carlton#Mark I (1978\u201386)|Carlton Mark I Estate]], in production from 1978 to 1986.]]\nSimilarly, the Vauxhall brand was dropped by GM in Ireland in favour of the German brand Opel.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=KNITAQAAMAAJ&dq=%22Republic+of+Ireland%22+%22Opel%22&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=%22under+the+Opel+name%22 ''European Motor Business''], Issues 24-27, [[Economist Intelligence Unit]], 1991, page 112</ref> Other [[right hand drive|RHD]] markets such as [[Malta]] and [[Cyprus]] soon following. In New Zealand, the brand was withdrawn in favour of Holden after the demise of the Chevette. [[GM Europe]] then began to standardise model names across both brands in the early 1990s. The Vauxhall Astra and Opel Kadett, for example, were both called Astra from 1991 onwards and the Vauxhall Nova and Opel Corsa were both called Corsa from 1993. The change was completed in 1995 when the [[Vauxhall Cavalier]] Mk 3 (Opel Vectra A) was replaced by the Opel Vectra B, called [[Vauxhall Vectra]]. Apart from the VX220, sold by Opel as the Speedster, all of Vauxhall's subsequent models have had the same names as those of Opel. However, the 2015 Viva revives earlier practice due to its Opel equivalent, the Karl, intentionally invoking Karl Opel, the second proprietor of the Opel business. Despite this, the Adam, named after his father and the founder of the company, is sold in Britain without a name change, potentially as it appears less overtly German.\n\nFrom 1994, Vauxhall models differed from Opels in their distinctive grille \u2013 featuring a \"V\", incorporating the Vauxhall badge. This was also used by [[Holden]] in New Zealand on both the Astra and Vectra, by [[Chevrolet]] in Brazil on the Mk1 Chevrolet Astra (Opel Astra F)<ref>[http://www.oficinabrasil.com.br/noticia/do-fundo-do-bau/chevrolet-astra-gls-um-belga-naturalizado-brasileiro-que-chegou-disposto-a-enfrentar-os-alemaes-e-italianos Chevrolet Astra GLS, um belga naturalizado brasileiro que chegou disposto a enfrentar os alem\u00e3es e italianos], Oficina Brasil, 10 August 2015</ref> and on the Indian version of the Opel Astra.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adpost.com/in/vehicles/4015/|title=Opel Astra Club 1 6 L Patrol April 2001 model Car FOR SALE from Ghaziabad Delhi @ Adpost.com Classifieds > India > #4015 Opel Astra Club 1 6 L Patrol April 2001 model Car FOR SALE from Ghaziabad Delhi ,free,indian,classified ad,classified ads,secondhand,second hand|website=www.adpost.com|accessdate=28 June 2019}}</ref> The \"V\" badging was an echo of the fluted V-shaped bonnets that had been used in some form on all Vauxhall cars since the very first. The \"V\" grille was not, however, used on the Vectra-replacing [[Opel Insignia|Insignia]], unveiled in 2008 and the 2009 [[Opel Astra|Vauxhall Astra]] and the 2010 [[Opel Meriva|Vauxhall Meriva]]. All the above, plus the US Saturn brand up to its demise in 2009, used the same grille bar with the \"V\" almost entirely muted out. These bars all carried identical badge mounts, enabling brand badges to be readily interchangeable.  The Opel-badged versions in right-hand drive form still however find their way into the United Kingdom; either as [[grey import]]s from Ireland or Malta, or are sold as new from [[car supermarket]]s who have sourced Irish specification vehicles in bulk.\n\nA model unique to the Vauxhall range was the high-performance [[Vauxhall Monaro|Monaro]] [[coup\u00e9]], which was sourced from and designed by [[Holden]] in Australia. Although this model was also produced in [[left hand drive]] (LHD) for markets like the US (where it was known as the [[Pontiac GTO]]) and for the Middle East (as the [[Holden Monaro|Chevrolet Lumina Coupe]]), the model was not offered by Opel in mainland Europe. Imports of this vehicle were limited to 15,000 to avoid additional safety testing. Future vehicles that have been confirmed by Vauxhall, but not by Opel, are the [[Holden Commodore]] SSV and the [[HSV GTS]]. Vauxhall confirmed the importation of the GTS just after the reborn [[Opel GT]] roadster was announced as not being imported into the UK.\n\nThe bodywork for the [[Holden Camira]] estate was used for the [[Vauxhall Cavalier]] estate in the UK (though not for the identical [[Opel Ascona]] in the rest of Europe) \u2013 conversely the rear bodywork of the T-car [[Vauxhall Chevette]] estate and [[Bedford Chevanne]] van was used for the respective [[Holden Gemini]] versions. Vauxhall's compact car, the [[Vauxhall Viva (1963\u20131979)|Viva]], formed the basis of the first [[Holden Torana]] in Australia in the 1960s.\n\nMany cars badged as Opels, even LHD models, are produced by Vauxhall for export. Vauxhall has built some Holdens for export, too, notably Vectra-As to New Zealand and Astra-Bs to both Australia and New Zealand. {{citation needed|reason=Many more cars badged as Vauxhall were produced by Opel|date=December 2014}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

By marriage, he also gained the rights to an area near London, south of the [[Thames]]. The house he built, Fulk's Hall, became known in time as Vauxhall. Vauxhall Iron Works adopted this emblem from the coat of arms to emphasise its links to the local area. When Vauxhall Iron Works moved to Luton in 1905, the griffin emblem coincidentally returned to its ancestral home.\n\nThe logo as pictured used to be square, but it is now circular, to enable it to fit in the same recess designed for the circular Opel emblem. Since the 1920s, the griffin has been redesigned and released nine times. 2008 saw the release of a revised version of the 2005 logo. [[Bill Parfitt]], Chairman and managing director of GM UK, said, \"While the new-look Griffin pays homage to our 100-year-plus manufacturing heritage in the UK, it also encapsulates Vauxhall's fresh design philosophy, first showcased in the current Astra, and set to continue with Insignia.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vauxhall.co.uk/vaux/pages/experienceVauxhall/news/article.jsp?article=insignia_0009&category=insignia |title=Vauxhall's Griffin Flies to New Horizon |publisher=Vauxhall Motors |date=10 September 2009 |accessdate=10 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817130015/http://www.vauxhall.co.uk/vaux/pages/experienceVauxhall/news/article.jsp?article=insignia_0009&category=insignia |archivedate=17 August 2009 }}</ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:The Vauxhall Griffin from Vauxhall D-type (1920).JPG|The Vauxhall Griffin from Vauxhall D-type (1920)\nFile:Vauxhall badge - Flickr - foshie.jpg|A Vauxhall grillplate from the 1940s showing the Griffin logo\nFile:Vauxhall VX220 - Flickr - The Car Spy (8).jpg|Vauxhall Motors' logo from the 1990s to 2008\n</gallery>\n\n==Sponsorships==\nVauxhall Motors sponsored the [[Football Conference]], the highest non-league [[Football in England|division of English football]], from 1986 until 1998.

The [[Vauxhall Magnum|Magnum coupe]] was heavier and less powerful than the dominant [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]], but still put up some strong performances in the hands of drivers such as Will Sparrow and Brian Culcheth.  From 1976, Vauxhall decided to heighten their profile in the sport by building a [[homologation]]-special version of the [[Vauxhall Chevette]], known as the Chevette HS.  This was a much more serious contender, and in the hands of drivers such as [[Pentti Airikkala]], [[Tony Pond]], [[Russell Brookes]] and [[Jimmy McRae]] it and its successor version, the Chevette HSR, won many events in Britain and Europe.  Airikkala won the [[British Rally Championship]] in a Chevette in 1979.\n\nThe Chevette was retired in 1983, and effort was concentrated for the next few years on the [[Group B]] [[Opel Manta 400]].  However, the [[Vauxhall Astra]] and [[Vauxhall Nova]] were campaigned in the lower power classes during the mid-1980s, and became popular amateurs' cars thanks to their reliability, ease of tuning and ready supply of parts.  After the banning of [[Group B]] in 1986 the [[Group A]] Astra returned to the forefront.  As a two-litre, front-wheel-drive car it was unable to challenge the four-wheel-drive cars for outright victory, but did score top ten placings on several World Championship events.  [[Louise Aitken-Walker]] won the ladies' World Championship in 1990 in an Astra, despite a serious accident on that year's Rally of Portugal when her car rolled down a hillside and into a lake.\n\nDuring 1991\u201392 serious consideration was given to campaigning the four-wheel-drive version of the [[Vauxhall Calibra]] in British and possibly world rallies, and a trial version contested the 1993 Swedish Rally in the hands of [[Stig Blomqvist]].  However, the cost was judged prohibitive, and in any case the 'Formula 2' category had been introduced into British rallying.  The latest version of the Astra was an ideal contender, and won the category in the 1993 and 1994 championships, driven by [[David Llewellin]].  Vauxhall campaigned successive versions of the Astra in the British championship until the late 1990s.\n[[File:Tom Chilton 2007 BTCC Oulton Park.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tom Chilton]] driving for Vauxhall at the Oulton Park round of the [[2007 British Touring Car Championship season|2007 British Touring Car Championship]]]]\nVauxhall first entered the [[British Touring Car Championship]] with the [[Vauxhall Cavalier]] in 1989.  The lead driver was [[John Cleland (racing driver)|John Cleland]], who remained with the team until his retirement in 1999.  The Cavalier was competitive, and often the fastest front-wheel-drive car in the series, and Cleland was second in the title race in 1992, and then fourth in the following two years.  In 1995, however, he won the title (adding to his 1989 title win in an Astra).  The Cavalier was replaced by the Vectra for 1996.  [[Yvan Muller]] was sixth in the 1999 British Touring Car Championship and fourth in 2000.\n\nIn 2001 the [[British Touring Car Championship|BTCC]] regulations changed and Vauxhall brought the [[BTC-T Vauxhall Astra Coupe|Astra Coupe]] into the BTCC. The Astra would dominate the BTCC between 2001 and 2004 with the drivers title won by [[Jason Plato]] in 2001, [[James Thompson (racing driver)|James Thompson]] in 2002 \u2013 2004 and [[Yvan Muller]] in 2003. Vauxhall also won the Manufacturers Award and Teams Award every year also.\n\nIn 2005 the Astra Coupe was replaced by the [[BTC-T Vauxhall Astra Sport Hatch|Astra Sport Hatch]] however it was not as competitive as the Astra Coupe and restricted success for Vauxhall in 2005 and 2006.\n\nIn 2007 The regulations changed again and Vauxhall brought the Vectra back. The Vectra brought success back to Vauxhall after [[Fabrizio Giovanardi]] won the 2007 and 2008 BTCC championship. Fabrizio Giovanardi finished 3rd in the championship in 2009 before Vauxhall pulled sponsorship out at the end of 2009 due to and the economic crisis and lack of official manufacturers in the BTCC.\n[[File:BTCC 2001 Plato.jpg|thumb|[[Jason Plato]] driving a modified [[Vauxhall Astra]] in the 2001 [[British Touring Car Championship]]]]\nIn November 2016 it was announced that Vauxhall would return to the BTCC in partnership with Power Maxed Racing.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.btcccrazy.co.uk/btcc/vauxhall-to-make-btcc-return-with-power-maxed-racing/|title=Vauxhall makes BTCC return with Power Maxed Racing|accessdate=22 November 2016|publisher=BTCC CRAZY|date=22 November 2016}}</ref> It was later announced that former BTCC and WTCC driver [[Tom Chilton]] would lead the team with Senna Proctor as his teammate. The team earned a podium at their first meeting of the year at Brands Hatch, and their best finish was a 2nd at Silverstone, with Rob Huff standing in for Tom Chilton.\n\n2018 saw the team return as TAG Autosport with [[Power Maxed Racing]], with Senna Proctor this time teaming up with [[Josh Cook]]. The first round of the year saw [[Senna Proctor]] take both his and the Team's first win at Brands Hatch, as he made an incredible drive from P28 to take the chequered flag. Josh Cook followed at Donington just a few weeks later with a Pole Position and a Lights to Flag victory in the first race, followed by yet another podium in Race 3. Another win followed for Cook at the following round at Thruxton. Throughout the year the team managed another 10 podiums, and dropped no lower than 3rd in the Teams Standings for the entire season. More than 50% of race finishes saw at least 1 driver in the Top 10.\n\nFor 2019, the decision was made to run as Sterling Insurance with Power Maxed Racing, with two new drivers; [[Jason Plato]], the most successful driver in British history (by race wins) and former Independents Champion [[Rob Collard]]. At the time of writing, the team have scored a number of podium finishes, and sit within the Top 5 in the Teams' Standings.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Steinmetz Opel Tuning]]\n*[[Irmscher]]\n*[[List of car manufacturers of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[VinFast]]\n\n==Note==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Vauxhall Motors}}\n{{curlie|Recreation/Autos/Makes_and_Models/Vauxhall/}}\n*[http://www.vauxhall.co.uk/ Vauxhall UK] official corporate website\n**[http://media.gm.com/content/media/gb/en/vauxhall/news.html Vauxhall Media Site]\n**[http://www.vauxhall.co.uk/microsite/vxr/ Vauxhall-VXR]\n\n{{Vauxhall Motors}}\n{{Navboxes|list1=\n{{PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn}}\n{{British Car Industry}}\n{{Automotive industry in the United Kingdom}}\n{{British Royal Warrant holders}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:Vauxhall Motors| ]]\n[[Category:Car manufacturers of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Former defence companies of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:History of the tank]]\n[[Category:British Royal Warrant holders]]\n[[Category:British subsidiaries of foreign companies]]\n[[Category:British companies established in 1857]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Bedfordshire]]\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1857]]\n[[Category:Emergency services equipment makers]]\n[[Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1857]]\n[[Category:1857 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:English brands]]\n[[Category:PSA Group]]\n[[Category:Opel subsidiaries]]\n[[Category:Car brands]]\n[[Category:1925 mergers and acquisitions]]\n[[Category:2017 mergers and acquisitions]]\n", "name_user": "6Anesthesia", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vauxhall_Motors"}

''Arion rufus'' is one of the largest species in the genus, up to 150&nbsp;mm extended. As an adult it lacks the lateral bands found in many smaller congeners, but in some forms the sides are paler than the back. The body colour is often reddish, sometimes vividly so, but orange, yellowish, brown and greyish forms are also usual, and some individuals may be black. The foot fringe is vertically striped and is often a different colour than the back. The head and tentacles are often darker than the rest of the body. The mucus is sticky and colourless or orange. Externally the species is not reliably distinguishable from several other species, including ''[[Black slug|A. ater]]''  and ''[[Spanish slug|A. vulgaris]]'', and can be difficult to distinguish from less closely related species such as ''[[Arion flagellus|A. flagellus]]'', especially in the Iberian Peninsula where further similar species exist.<ref name=\"Wiese2014\">{{cite book |last1=Wiese |first1=V. |title=Die Landschnecken Deutschlands |date=2014 |publisher=Quelle & Meyer |location=Wiebelsheim |isbn=9783494015514}}</ref><ref name=\"Rowson2014b\">{{cite book |last1=Rowson |first1=B. |last2=Turner |first2=J. |last3=Anderson |first3=R. |last4=Symondson |first4=B. |title=Slugs of Britain and Ireland: identification, understanding and control |date=2014 |publisher=FSC |location=Telford |isbn=9781908819130}}</ref><ref name=\"Welter-Schultes2012\"/>\n\nEggs are typically about 5&nbsp;mm in diameter, slighly ovoid.

The anatomical differences between ''A. rufus'' and ''A. ater'' are more subtle: the latter tends to have a larger lower atrium, and its ligula differs (e.g. bowl-shaped rather than C-shaped).<ref name=\"Reise2020\"/>\n\n''Arion rufus'' will often rock spectacularly from side to side when irritated, which is useful to distinguish it from ''A. flagellus'' and generally from ''A. vulgaris'', but not from ''A. ater''.<ref name=\"Rowson2014b\"/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] described ''A. rufus'' together with ''Arion ater'' in 1758.<ref name=\"Linn1758\">{{cite book |last1=Linn\u00e6us |first1=C. |title=Systema natur\u00e6 per regna tria natur\u00e6, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.

It is an [[omnivore]].<ref name=\"Rowson2014b\"/>\n\n''Arion rufus'' is hermaphrodite and during its mating [[spermatophores]] are swapped reciprocally. Mating typically starts with one slug following the other, periodically nibbling its tail. When the leading slug doubles back, they may form a wheel configuration circling clockwise, with each nibbling the other. This soon evolves into the [[Yin and yang|yin-yang]] configuration (or the wheel step may be skipped), with each animal hooked around the other, their [[Reproductive system of gastropods#simultaneous hermaphrodites|genital pores]] pressed together, the configuration no longer rotating. The genitalia take some minutes to engage and evert, the [[Reproductive system of gastropods#simultaneous hermaphrodites|epiphallus]] (spermatophore producing organ) connecting to the [[Reproductive system of gastropods#simultaneous hermaphrodites|bursa trunk]] of the other, mutually. This may take several attempts and sometimes is unsuccessful. Then the genital [[Reproductive system of gastropods#genital structures|atria]] evert, and swell rapidly (1\u20132 min) to form a large, white, spherical mass between the bodies. The slugs remain like this for 90 minutes or longer, during which time a spermatophore is manufactured, filled with sperm, and in part passed over to the partner, hidden by the enveloping atria. Eventually one partner starts to become active, the configuration consequently rotates, the atria contract, and the genitalia separate. The spermatophores, anchored in the bursa trunk, are thereby pulled out of the donor's epiphallus. As the genitalia fully retract the spermatophore is taken in.<ref name=\"Dreijers2013\">{{cite journal |last1=Dreijers |first1=E. |last2=Reise |first2=H. |last3=Hutchinson |first3=J.M.C. |title=Mating of the slugs ''Arion lusitanicus'' auct. non Mabille and ''A. rufus'' (L.): different genitalia and mating behaviours are incomplete barriers to interspecific sperm exchange |journal=Journal of Molluscan Studies |date=2013 |volume=79 |pages=51\u201363 |doi=10.1093/mollus/eys033}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nArion rufus 1650.JPG|Dark individual\nRed slug (Arion rufus).JPG|Light individual\nArion rufus copulation, parende gewone wegslakken.jpg|Copulation\nNaaktslak eieren.jpg|Egg cluster\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Arion rufus}}\n* [http://eol.org/pages/403118/media ''Arion rufus''] at [[Encyclopedia of Life]] (3 pages)\n* [http://www.animalbase.uni-goettingen.de/zooweb/servlet/AnimalBase/home/species?id=1812 ''Arion rufus''] at [[Animalbase]] taxonomy, short description, distribution, biology, status (threats), images\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q2153396}}\n\n[[Category:Arion (gastropod)]]\n[[Category:Gastropods described in 1758]]\n[[Category:Molluscs of Europe]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus]]\n", "text_old": "{{Taxobox\n| image = Arion rufus (Dourbes).jpg\n| status = G4\n| status_system = TNC\n| regnum = [[Animal]]ia\n| phylum = [[Mollusc]]a\n| classis = [[Gastropod]]a\n| unranked_superfamilia =\nclade [[Heterobranchia]]<br/>\nclade [[Euthyneura]]<br/>clade [[Panpulmonata]]<br/>\nclade [[Eupulmonata]]<br/>\nclade [[Stylommatophora]]<br/>\ninformal group [[Sigmurethra]]\n| superfamilia = [[Arionoidea]]\n| familia = [[Arionidae]]\n| genus = ''[[Arion (gastropod)|Arion]]''\n| species = '''''A. rufus'''''\n| binomial = ''Arion rufus''\n| binomial_authority = ([[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], 1758)<ref name=\"Linn1758\"/>\n}}\nThe '''red slug''' ('''''Arion rufus'''''), also known as the '''large red slug''',<ref name=ire>[http://www.habitas.org.uk/molluscireland/species.asp?ID=23 ''Arion'' (''Arion'') ''rufus'' (Linnaeus 1758), Large red slug] MolluscIreland.

Oregon State University.</ref> is a species of land [[slug]] in the family [[Arionidae]], the roundback slugs.\n\n==Description==\nSlugs in the genus ''Arion'' have the [[pneumostome]] (respiratory pore) in the front part of the [[mantle (mollusc)|mantle]] and a round back without a [[slug#keel|keel]]. ''Arion rufus'' is one of the largest species in the genus, up to 150 mm extended. As an adult it lacks the lateral bands found in many smaller congeners, but in some forms the sides are paler than the back. The body colour is often reddish, sometimes vividly so, but orange, yellowish, brown and greyish forms are also usual, and some individuals may be black. The foot fringe is vertically striped and is often a different colour than the back. The head and tentacles are often darker than the rest of the body. The mucus is sticky and colourless or orange. Externally the species is not reliably distinguishable from several other species, including ''[[Black slug|A. ater]]''  and ''[[Spanish slug|A. vulgaris]]'', and can be difficult to distinguish from less closely related species such as ''[[Arion flagellus|A. flagellus]]'', especially in the Iberian Peninsula where further similar species exist.<ref name=\"Wiese2014\">{{cite book |last1=Wiese |first1=V. |title=Die Landschnecken Deutschlands |date=2014 |publisher=Quelle & Meyer |location=Wiebelsheim |isbn=9783494015514}}</ref><ref name=\"Rowson2014b\">{{cite book |last1=Rowson |first1=B. |last2=Turner |first2=J. |last3=Anderson |first3=R. |last4=Symondson |first4=B. |title=Slugs of Britain and Ireland: identification, understanding and control |date=2014 |publisher=FSC |location=Telford |isbn=9781908819130}}</ref><ref name=\"Welter-Schultes2012\"/>\n\nEggs are typically about 5 mm in diameter, slighly ovoid. They are opaque white, because of a calcareous layer in the shell.<ref name=\"Rowson2014b\"/> Juveniles often have lateral bands.<ref name=\"Rowson2014b\"/>\n\nAdult ''A. rufus'' and ''A. ater'' are straightforward to distinguish from ''A. vulgaris'' and ''A. flagellus'' by dissection; in the former pair the oviduct is thinner because the ligula is positioned in the upper atrium, not the oviduct. The anatomical differences between ''A. rufus'' and ''A. ater'' are more subtle: the latter tends to have a larger lower atrium, and its ligula differs (e.g. bowl-shaped rather than C-shaped).<ref name=\"Reise2020\"/>\n\n''Arion rufus'' will often rock spectacularly from side to side when irritated, which is useful to distinguish it from ''A. flagellus'' and generally from ''A. vulgaris'', but not from ''A. ater''.<ref name=\"Rowson2014b\"/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] described ''A. rufus'' together with ''Arion ater'' in 1758.<ref name=\"Linn1758\">{{cite book |last1=Linn\u00e6us |first1=C. |title=Systema natur\u00e6 per regna tria natur\u00e6, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.

It is an [[omnivore]].<ref name=\"Rowson2014b\"/>\n\n\n''Arion rufus'' is hermaphrodite and during its mating [[spermatophores]] are swapped reciprocally. Mating typically starts with one slug following the other, periodically nibbling its tail. When the leading slug doubles back, they may form a wheel configuration circling clockwise, with each nibbling the other. This soon evolves into the [[Yin and yang|yin-yang]] configuration (or the wheel step may be skipped), with each animal hooked around the other, their [[Reproductive system of gastropods#simultaneous hermaphrodites|genital pores]] pressed together, the configuration no longer rotating. The genitalia take some minutes to engage and evert, the [[Reproductive system of gastropods#simultaneous hermaphrodites|epiphallus]] (spermatophore producing organ) connecting to the [[Reproductive system of gastropods#simultaneous hermaphrodites|bursa trunk]] of the other, mutually. This may take several attempts and sometimes is unsuccessful. Then the genital [[Reproductive system of gastropods#genital structures|atria]] evert, and swell rapidly (1\u20132 min) to form a large, white, spherical mass between the bodies. The slugs remain like this for 90 minutes or longer, during which time a spermatophore is manufactured, filled with sperm, and in part passed over to the partner, hidden by the enveloping atria. Eventually one partner starts to become active, the configuration consequently rotates, the atria contract, and the genitalia separate. The spermatophores, anchored in the bursa trunk, are thereby pulled out of the donor's epiphallus. As the genitalia fully retract the spermatophore is taken in.<ref name=\"Dreijers2013\">{{cite journal |last1=Dreijers |first1=E. |last2=Reise |first2=H. |last3=Hutchinson |first3=J.M.C. |title=Mating of the slugs ''Arion lusitanicus'' auct. non Mabille and ''A. rufus'' (L.): different genitalia and mating behaviours are incomplete barriers to interspecific sperm exchange |journal=Journal of Molluscan Studies |date=2013 |volume=79 |pages=51\u201363 |doi=10.1093/mollus/eys033}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nArion rufus 1650.JPG|Dark individual\nRed slug (Arion rufus).JPG|Light individual\nArion rufus copulation, parende gewone wegslakken.jpg|Copulation\nNaaktslak eieren.jpg|Egg cluster\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Arion rufus}}\n* [http://eol.org/pages/403118/media ''Arion rufus''] at [[Encyclopedia of Life]] (3 pages)\n* [http://www.animalbase.uni-goettingen.de/zooweb/servlet/AnimalBase/home/species?id=1812 ''Arion rufus''] at [[Animalbase]] taxonomy, short description, distribution, biology, status (threats), images\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q2153396}}\n\n[[Category:Arion (gastropod)]]\n[[Category:Gastropods described in 1758]]\n[[Category:Molluscs of Europe]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus]]\n", "name_user": "Nat965", "label": "safe", "comment": "ApplyGen fix(es),typo(s) fixed: particulary \u2192 particularly", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_slug"}

The battle represented the most intense phase of the Japanese [[Battle of the Philippines (1941\u201342)|invasion of the Philippines]] during World War II. In January 1942, forces of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Navy]] invaded [[Luzon]] along with several islands in the Philippine Archipelago after the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombing of the American naval base at Pearl Harbor]].\n\nThe commander-in-chief of all U.S. and Filipino forces in the islands, General [[Douglas MacArthur]], consolidated all of his Luzon-based units on the [[Bataan Peninsula]] to fight against the Japanese army. By this time, the Japanese controlled nearly all of Southeast Asia. The [[Bataan]] Peninsula and the island of [[Corregidor]] were the only remaining Allied strongholds in the region.\n\nDespite a lack of supplies, American and Filipino forces managed to fight the Japanese for three months, engaging them initially in a fighting retreat southward. As the combined American and Filipino forces made a last stand, the delay cost the Japanese valuable time and prevented immediate victory across the Pacific. The American surrender at Bataan to the Japanese, with 76,000 soldiers surrendering in the Philippines altogether,<ref name=imprisoned /> was the largest in [[Military history of the United States|American]] and [[Military history of the Philippines|Filipino military histories]], and was the largest United States surrender since the [[American Civil War]]'s [[Battle of Harpers Ferry|Battle of Harper's Ferry]].<ref>Robertson, p. 606.</ref> Soon afterwards, U.S. and Filipino [[prisoners of war]] were forced into the [[Bataan Death March]].<ref name=\"William L. O'Neill p 115\">William L. O'Neill, ''A Democracy at War: America's Fight at Home and Abroad in World War II'', p 115 {{ISBN|0-02-923678-9}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\nThe capture of the Philippine Islands was crucial to Japan's effort to control the Southwest Pacific, seize the [[Natural resource|resource]]-rich [[Dutch East Indies]], and protect its [[Southeast Asia]]n flank. After Japanese carrier planes [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked]] the [[United States Pacific Fleet]] at [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] on the morning of 7 December 1941 (8 December, [[Manila]] time), [[Taiwan]]-based aircraft, within seven hours, pounded the main bases of the American Far East Air Force at [[Clark Air Base|Clark Field]] in [[Pampanga]], Iba Field in [[Zambales]], [[Nichols Field]] near [[Manila]], and the headquarters of the [[United States Asiatic Fleet]] in the Philippines, at [[Cavite]]. Many American planes were caught on the ground and summarily destroyed. In one day, the Japanese had gained air superiority over the Philippine Islands. This forced the U.S. Asiatic Fleet to withdraw its surface ships from its naval base in Cavite and retreat southwards, leaving only the submarine force to resist the Japanese.\n\nFrom 8 to 10 December, scattered resistance by ground troops and remaining American air and naval forces failed to stop preliminary landings to seize airfields at [[Batan Island]], [[Aparri, Cagayan|Aparri]], and [[Vigan City]]. Army air force B-17s, often with little if any fighter escort, attacked Japanese ships offloading at Gonzaga and the Vigan landings on Luzon. Submarines of the Asiatic Fleet were also assigned to the effort.\n\nIn one last coordinated action by the Far East Air Force, U.S. planes damaged two Japanese transports, the [[Japanese battleship Nagato|flagship ''Nagato'']], and a destroyer, and sank one [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]]. These air attacks and naval actions, however, did not significantly delay the Japanese assault.\n\nThese small-scale landings preceded the main assault on 22 December 1941, at [[Lingayen Gulf]] in [[Pangasinan]] and Lamon Bay, [[Quezon|Tayabas]], by the 14th Japanese Imperial Army, led by Lieutenant General [[Masaharu Homma]].\n\nBy effectively neutralizing U.S. air and naval power in the Philippines, the Japanese gained supremacy that isolated the Philippines from reinforcement and resupply, and provided itself with both airfields for support of its invasion forces and staging bases for further operations in the Dutch East Indies.\n\n==War Plan Orange-3==\nWhen MacArthur returned to active duty, the latest revision plans for the defense of the Philippine Islands had been completed in April 1941 and was called WPO-3, based on the joint Army-Navy [[War Plan Orange]] of 1938, which involved hostilities between the United States and Japan.<ref name=Morton>{{cite book |title=The Fall of the Philippines |last=Morton |first=Louis |authorlink= |year=1953 |publisher=US Army Center of Military History |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> Under WPO-3, the Philippine garrison was to hold the entrance to Manila Bay and deny its use to Japanese naval forces and ground forces were to prevent enemy landings. If the enemy prevailed, they were to withdraw to the Bataan Peninsula, which was recognized as the key to the control of Manila Bay. It was to be defended to the \"last extremity\".<ref name=Morton /> In addition to the regular U.S. Army troops, the defenders could rely on the Philippine Army, which had been organized and trained by General MacArthur.<ref name=Morton />\n\nHowever, in April 1941, the Navy estimated that it would require at least two years for the Pacific Fleet to fight its way across the Pacific. Army planners in early 1941 believed supplies would be exhausted within six months and the garrison would fall.<ref name=Morton /> MacArthur assumed command of the Allied army in July 1941 and rejected WPO-3 as defeatist, preferring a more aggressive course of action.<ref name=Murphy>{{cite book |title=Inside the Bataan Death March: Defeat, Travail and Memory |last=Murphy |first=Kevin C. |authorlink= |year=2014 |publisher=McFarland |location= |isbn=978-0786496815 |pages=328 |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> He recommended\u2014among other things\u2014a coastal defense strategy that would include the entire archipelago. His recommendations were followed in the plan that was eventually approved.<ref name=Morton /> Due to MacArthur's decision, with tacit approval from Washington, to change the plan under [[United States color-coded war plans#Rainbow plans|War Plan Rainbow 5]], it was ordered that the entire archipelago would be defended, with the necessary supplies dispersed behind the beachheads for defending forces to use while defending against the landings. With the return to War Plan Orange 3, the necessary supplies to support the defenders for the anticipated six-month-long defensive position were not available in the necessary quantities for the defenders who would withdraw to Bataan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/70-7_06.htm |title=The Decision To Withdraw to Bataan |author=Louis Morton |date= |work=U.S. Army Center of Military History |publisher=[[United States Army]] |accessdate=22 May 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Battle==\nWhen the Japanese made their first landings on 10 and 12 December at the northern and southern extremities of Luzon, General MacArthur made no disposition to contest them. He correctly surmised that these landings were designed to secure advance air bases and that the Japanese had no intention of driving on Manila from any of these beachheads. He did not regard the situation as serious enough to warrant a change in his plan to oppose the main attack, when it came, with an all-out defense at the beaches. The MacArthur Plan, then, remained in effect.<ref name=Morton />\n\nOn December 20, US Navy submarine {{USS|Stingray|SS-186|6}} spotted a large convoy of troop ships with escorts. This was General Homma's landing force, and included 85 troop transports, two battleships, six cruisers, and two dozen destroyers. The convoy was engaged by three submarines: USS ''Stingray'', {{USS|Saury|SS-189|6}}, and {{USS|Salmon|SS-182|6}}, who fired torpedo after torpedo into the convoy, most of which failed to explode, due to the [[Mark XIV torpedo]]'s defective detonators.

He charged the [[North Luzon Force]] under Maj. Gen. [[Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright IV]] with holding back the main Japanese assault and keeping the road to Bataan open for use by the [[South Luzon Force]] of Maj. Gen. [[George M. Parker (general)|George Parker]], which proceeded quickly and in remarkably good order, given the chaotic situation. To achieve this, Wainwright deployed his forces in a series of five defensive lines outlined in WPO-3:\n\n* D1: [[Aguilar, Pangasinan|Aguilar]] to [[San Carlos City, Pangasinan|San Carlos]] to [[Urdaneta City]]\n* D2: [[Agno River]]\n* D3: [[Santa Ignacia, Tarlac|Santa Ignacia]] to [[Gerona, Tarlac|Gerona]] to [[Guimba, Nueva Ecija|Guimba]] to San Jose\n* D4: [[Tarlac]] to [[Cabanatuan City]]\n* D5: [[Bamban, Tarlac|Bamban]] to Sibul Springs\n\n====Layac Line====\n[[File:DinalupihanBataajf2720 03.JPG|thumb|right|WWII First Line of Defense Memorial ([[Dinalupihan, Bataan]], [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippines]])]]\n\nThe main force of General [[Masaharu Homma]]'s 14th Area Army came ashore at Lingayen Gulf on the morning of 22 December. The defenders failed to hold the beaches. By the end of the day, the Japanese had secured most of their objectives and were in position to emerge onto the central plain.<ref name=Morton /> Facing Homma's troops were four Filipino divisions: the [[21st Division (Philippines)|21st]], the [[71st Division (Philippines)|71st]], the [[11th Division (Philippines)|11th]], and the [[91st Division (Philippines)|91st]], as well as a battalion of [[Philippine Scouts]] backed by a few tanks.<ref name=herman /> Along Route 3\u2014a cobblestone road that led directly to Manila<ref name=herman />\u2014the Japanese soon made contact with the Filipino 71st Division. At this point the action of the American artillery stalled the Japanese attack. However, Japanese planes and tanks entering the action routed the Filipino infantry, leaving the artillery uncovered.<ref name=Morton /> A second Japanese division landed at Lamon Bay, south of Manila, on December 23 and advanced north.<ref name=Darman>{{cite book |title=Attack on Pearl Harbor: America Enters World War II |last=Darman |first=Peter |year=2012 |publisher=Rosen Publishing |location= |isbn=978-1448892334 |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1448892333}}</ref>\n\nIt was now evident to General Wainwright that he could no longer hold back the Japanese advance. Late on the afternoon of the 23rd, Wainwright telephoned General MacArthur's headquarters in Manila and informed him that any further defense of the Lingayen beaches was \"impracticable.\" He requested and was given permission to withdraw behind the Agno River.<ref name=Morton /> MacArthur weighed two choices: either make a firm stand on the line of the Agno and give Wainwright his best unit, the [[Philippine Division]], for a counterattack; or withdraw all the way to Bataan in planned stages. He decided on the latter, thus abandoning his own plan for defense and reverting to the old ORANGE plan. Having made his decision to withdraw to Bataan, MacArthur notified all force commanders on the night of 23 December that \"WPO-3 is in effect.\"<ref name=Morton />\n\nMeanwhile, [[Manuel L. Quezon]], the President of the Philippine Commonwealth, together with his family and government staff were evacuated to Corregidor, along with MacArthur's [[United States Army Forces in the Far East]] (USAFFE) headquarters, on the night of 24 December 1941, while all USAFFE military personnel were removed from the major urban areas. On the 26th Manila was officially declared an [[open city]] and MacArthur's proclamation was published in the newspapers and broadcast over the radio. The Japanese were not notified officially of the proclamation but learned of it through radio broadcasts. The next day, and thereafter, they bombed the port area, from which supplies were being shipped to Bataan and Corregidor.<ref name=Morton />\n\n[[File:Layac Junction Jan 1942.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|Defense of the Layac Junction approach to Bataan 2\u20136 January 1942]]\nAfter General Douglas MacArthur had withdrawn his army down the island of Luzon's central plain into the [[Bataan Peninsula]], one last line existed before the Japanese invaders reached the main line of resistance. The Americans attempted to slow the Japanese entry into [[Bataan]] by fighting a delaying action at Layac, thus gaining time and deceiving the enemy as to the location of the main defensive positions. For the first time in World War II, American troops faced Japanese soldiers on the ground.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n====Porac\u2013Guagua Line====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Dinalupihanjf3140.JPG|thumb|Historical Marker (6 January 1942)]]\nFrom 1 to 5 January 1942, as the entire USAFFE converged from south and north, delaying actions were fought to allow the struggling withdrawal to Bataan. The fiercest fighting occurred at the hastily emplaced Porac\u2013Guagua Line, where the 11th and 21st divisions, respectively led by Brigadier Generals [[William E. Brougher]] and [[Mateo Capinpin]], with the [[26th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|26th Cavalry Regiment]] of Colonel Clinton A. Pierce in reserve, held the line, mostly on open and unprepared ground, against massive aerial and artillery bombardment, strong tank assaults, and infantry [[Banzai charge|banzai attack]]s by the Takahashi and Tanaka detachments. Both sides suffered heavy casualties.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\nOverlooked in this report are the actions of the 23rd Infantry Regiment of the PA, led by senior instructor Col. Wallace A Mead. The 23rd Regiment established the defensive line at Porac-Pampanga on or around 2 January 1942. Colonel Mead was later awarded the [[Silver Star]] for his actions there. The 23rd's defense allowed Capinpin's forces to withdraw and establish new defensive positions. It was Capinpin's recount of the fighting that day that was offered as support for Mead's citation.\n\n====Abucay\u2013Mauban Line====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Abucay Line.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Abucay Line 9\u201323 January 1942]]\nWar Plan Orange 3 called for two defensive lines across Bataan. The first extended across the peninsula from Mauban in the west to Mabatang, Abucay in the east. General Wainwright, commanding the newly organised I Philippine Corps of 22,500 troops, held the western sector. I Corps included the Philippine Army's [[1st Infantry Division (Philippines)|1st Regular]], [[31st Division (Philippines)|31st]], and [[91st Division (Philippines)|91st Divisions]], the 26th Cavalry (Philippine Scouts (PS)) and a battery of field artillery and self-propelled guns. General Parker and the new II Philippine Corps, which included the Philippine Army's 11th, 21st, [[41st Division (Philippines)|41st]], and [[51st Division (Philippines)|51st divisions]] and the [[57th Infantry Regiment (United States)|57th Infantry]] (PS), and numbered 25,000 men, defended the eastern sector. All of the divisions, already under strength at the onset of war, had suffered serious combat losses, particularly to desertions. The U.S. Army's Philippine Division, made up of the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|31st Infantry]], the [[45th Infantry Regiment (United States)|45th Infantry]] (PS), and supporting units became the \"Bataan Defense Force Reserve\". Mount Natib, a {{convert|4222|ft|m|adj=on}}-high mountain that split the peninsula, served as the boundary line between the two corps. The commanders anchored their lines on the mountain, but, since they considered the rugged terrain impassable, they did not extend their forces far up its slopes. The two corps were therefore not in direct contact with each other, leaving a serious gap in the defense line. With the fighting withdrawal completed, the Abucay\u2013Mauban Line, the USAFFE's main battle position was now in place.\n\n===Stand===\n[[File:Mauban Line.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Mauban Line positions 18\u201325 January 1942]]\n\nOn 9 January, Japanese forces under Lieutenant General Susumu Morioka assaulted the eastern flank of the Abucay\u2013Mauban Line, and were repulsed by the 91st Division of Brigadier General Luther Stevens and Colonel George S. Clark's 57th Infantry (PS). On 12 January, amid fierce fighting, 2nd Lieutenant [[Alexander R. Nininger]], a platoon leader in the 57th Infantry, sacrificed his life when, armed with only a rifle and [[hand grenades]], he forced his way into enemy foxholes during [[hand-to-hand combat]], permitting his unit to retake Abucay Hacienda; for his actions, he was [[posthumous recognition|posthumously awarded]] the [[Medal of Honor]]. Another extreme act of bravery was put forth by a Filipino named Narcisco Ortilano.<ref name=\"None More Courageous - American War Heroes of Today\"/> He was on a [[M1917 Browning machine gun|water-cooled heavy machine gun]] when the Japanese burst out of a canebrake in a banzai attack. He shot dozens of the Japanese with his machine gun, then pulled out his Colt .45 and shot five more when the machine gun jammed. Then, when one Japanese soldier stabbed at him with a bayonet, he desperately tried to grab the gun, got his thumb cut off, but still held on, and then with a sudden burst of adrenaline he turned the gun on the enemy soldier and stabbed him in the chest. When another Japanese soldier swung a bayonet at him, he turned his rifle on the soldier and shot him dead. Narcisco received the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]].<ref name=\"None More Courageous - American War Heroes of Today\">{{citation | title = None More Courageous \u2013 American War Heroes of Today| url = https://books.google.com/?id=ODIN0EU9yLUC&pg=PA197&lpg=PA197&dq=narcisco+ortilano#v=onepage&q=narcisco%20ortilano&f=false| publisher = Stewart H.

Jones]], respectively, aided by the 43rd and Colonel Wallace A Mead's 23rd Infantry, stubbornly refused the Japanese their left flank. The Japanese advanced to the Salian River Valley through a gap made by the 51st Infantry's withdrawal. But a patrol discovered the infiltration, and units of the 21st Division rushed to the valley and repulsed the attackers after a savage encounter.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAt another engagement farther to the west, a Japanese force surprised and routed the 53rd Infantry of Colonel John R. Boatwright. This force also penetrated deep behind the Abucay\u2013Mauban Line along the Abo-Abo River Valley, but their advance was held up by combined units of the 21st and 51st Divisions, the 31st Division of Brigadier General [[Clifford Bluemel]], and Colonel John H. Rodman's 92nd Infantry at the Bani-Guirol Forest area. The 31st Infantry and the 45th Infantry, Philippine scouts of Colonel Thomas W. Doyle, partially restored the abandoned line of the 51st Division.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nOn 15 January, the reinforced 1st Regular Division of Brigadier General Fidel Segundo, defending the Morong sector, came under heavy bombardment, but held the line. The Japanese penetrated through a huge gap in the Silangan-Natib area and established a roadblock on Mauban Ridge, threatening to cut off the division's rear. Repeated attacks by the 91st Division and 71st Division, and 92nd Infantry failed to dislodge the Japanese. The attackers' nightly raids and infiltration tactics became more frequent. Previously, General Parker's II Corps had prevented a similar encirclement at the Salian River battle, but the position of General Wainwright's I Corps was deemed indefensible, and the Abucay\u2013Mauban Line was abandoned on 22 January.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n====Battle of Trail Two====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:jia flame throw bataan.jpg|thumb|300px|Japanese flamethrower in action against a bunker on the Orion-Bagac Line]]\nWithin four days, the Orion-Bagac Line was formed. But the defenders had yet to complete their withdrawal to the reserve battle position when the Japanese struck again, through a gap held by I Corps. General Bluemel hastily organized a defense along Trail Two, consisting of 32nd Infantry, 41st Infantry and 51st Division reinforcements, in time to stop a major offensive and plug the gap.\n\n====Battle of the Pockets====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Orion-Bagac Line.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|The Orion\u2013Bagac line showing the U.S. positions around 27 January 1942]]\nThe remaining Japanese troops managed to get through, however, and held out at some rear sectors of the Orion-Bagac Line at the Tuol River Valley behind the 11th Division, and in the Gogo-Cotar River behind the 1st Regular Division. From 23 January to 17 February, coordinated action by the defenders to eliminate these salients of resistance became known as the \"Battle of the [[Pocket (military)|pockets]]\". Fierce fighting marked the action. Captain [[Alfredo M. Santos]], of the 1st Regular Division, outmaneuvered the enemy during their attempt to pocket the area. In both attempts, his unit successfully broke through the Gogo-Cotar and Tuol pockets, thus earning for himself the moniker \"hero of the pockets\". For his successes, he was promoted to major in the field. Major [[Alfredo M. Santos|Santos]] was then given the hazardous mission of closing the gaps and annihilating the enemy troops who had infiltrated the lines, as the gap posed a serious threat to the positions and the security of the division. He led a counterattack against the strong and numerically superior Japanese forces positioned between the MLR and the Regimental Reserve Line (RRL). The fighting began at dawn on 29 January 1942, and the Americans restored the defensive sector assigned to the 1st Regular Division. On 3 February 1942, 1st Lieutenant [[Willibald C. Bianchi]] of the 45th Infantry, Philippine scouts, led a reinforced platoon forward against two enemy machine-gun nests, silenced them with grenades, and then manned an antiaircraft machine gun until dying of his wounds. His Medal of Honor was awarded posthumously. Of the 2,000 Japanese soldiers engaged, 377 were reported to have escaped.\n\n[[File:Bataan Pockets Jan Feb 1942.jpg|thumb|250 px|Battle of the Pockets on the Orion-Bagac Line]]\nGeneral Homma, on 8 February, ordered the suspension of offensive operations in order to reorganize his forces. This could not be carried out immediately, because the 16th Division remained engaged trying to extricate the pocketed 3rd Battalion, 20th Infantry. With further casualties, the remnants of the 3rd Battalion, 378 officers and men, were extricated on 15 February. On 22 February, the 14th Army line was withdrawn a few miles to the north, with USAFFE forces re-occupying positions evacuated by the Japanese.\n\n====Battle of the Points====\n[[File:CMH FoTP-Map 13.jpg|thumb|Japanese landings on Bataan 23 January \u2013 1 February 1942]]\n\nIn an attempt to outflank I Corps and isolate the service command area commanded by USAFFE deputy commander Brigadier General Allan C. McBride, Japanese troops of the 2nd Battalion, 20th Infantry, 16th Division, were landed on the west coast of southern Bataan on the night of 22 January. Intercepted by U.S. [[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-34|PT-34]], two barges were sunk and the rest scattered in two groups, neither of which landed on the objective beach. The Japanese forces were contained on their beachheads by members of Philippine constabulary units, a hastily organized naval infantry battalion, and by personnel of several [[United States Army Air Corps|U.S. Army Air Corps]] pursuit squadrons fighting as infantry, including [[Ed Dyess]] and [[Ray C. Hunt]].<ref name=Dyess>Dyess, W.E., 1944, The Dyess Story, New York: G.P.

Sailors used the Canopus machine shop to fabricate makeshift mountings for [[machine gun]]s salvaged from Patrol Wing Ten's damaged aircraft. The Marines were distributed through the ranks, and the sailors were told to \"watch them and do as they do.\" The sailors attempted to make their white uniforms more suitable for jungle combat by dying them with coffee grounds. The result was closer to yellow than khaki, and the diary of a dead Japanese officer described them as a suicide squad dressed in brightly colored uniforms and talking loudly in an attempt to draw fire and reveal the enemy positions.<ref name=\"proceedings\">Gordon, John IV, Capt. USA \"The Navy's Infantry at Bataan\" ''United States Naval Institute Proceedings Supplement'' March 1985 pp.64\u201369</ref>\n\nJapanese commanders, in an attempt to hold onto their lodgements, reinforced the beachheads piecemeal, but could not break out. Battles were fought ferociously against a company-sized group at the Lapay-Longoskawayan points from 23 to 29 January, at the Quinawan-Aglaloma points from 22 January to 8 February, and at the Silalim-Anyasan points from 27 January to 13 February. Out of the 2,000 Japanese troops committed to these battles, only 43 wounded returned to their lines. These engagements were collectively termed the \"Battle of the Points\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Fall of Bataan===\nOn the night of 12 March, General MacArthur, his family, and several USAFFE staff officers [[Douglas MacArthur's escape from the Philippines|left Corregidor]] for [[Mindanao]] aboard four [[PT boat]]s commanded by Lieutenant Commander [[John D. Bulkeley]]. For this, and a number of other feats over the course of four months and eight days, Bulkeley was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]], the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]], the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] and other citations.\n\nMacArthur was eventually flown to Australia where he broadcast to the [[Filipino people]] his famous \"I Shall Return\" promise. MacArthur's departure marked the end of the USAFFE, and by 22 March, the defending army was renamed the United States Forces in the Philippines (USFIP), and Lieutenant General [[Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright IV]] was placed in command.\n\nAfter the failure of their first attack against Bataan, the Japanese general headquarters sent strong artillery forces to the Philippines in order to smash the American fortifications. They had 190 artillery pieces, which included bigger guns like 150&nbsp;mm cannons and the rare [[Type 45 240&nbsp;mm howitzer]]. The 1st Artillery headquarters, under Major General Kineo Kitajima, who was a known authority on IJA artillery, also moved to the Philippines along with the main forces to command and control these artillery units. Also, the Japanese high command reinforced General Homma's 14th Imperial Army, and toward the end of March, the Japanese forces prepared for the final assault.\n\nOn 3 April, the entire Orion-Bagac Line was subjected to incessant bombings by 100 aircraft and artillery bombardment by 300 artillery pieces from 9:00&nbsp;a.m. to 3:00&nbsp;pm, which turned the [[Mount Samat]] stronghold into an inferno. Over the course of the next three days ([[Good Friday]] to [[Easter|Easter Sunday]], 1942), the Japanese 65th Brigade and 4th Division spearheaded the main attack at the left flank of II Corps. Everywhere along the line, the American and Filipino defenders were driven back by Japanese tanks and infantry.\n\nBased on his two prior attempts, General Homma had estimated that the final offensive would require a week to breach the Orion-Bagac Line and a month to liquidate two final defense lines he believed had been prepared on Bataan. When the opening attack required just three days, he pushed his forces on 6 April to meet expected counterattacks head-on. The Japanese launched a drive into the center, penetrated into flanks held by the 22nd and 23rd Regiments of the 21st Division, captured Mount Samat and outflanked all of II Corps. Counterattacks by the U.S. Army and Philippine Scout regulars held in reserve were futile; only the 57th Infantry gained any ground, soon lost.\n\nAll along the battle front, units of I Corps, together with the devastated remnants of II Corps, crumbled and straggled to the rear. The commanders on Bataan lost all contact with their units, except by runner in a few instances. In the last two days of the defense of Bataan, the entire Allied defense progressively disintegrated and collapsed, clogging all roads with refugees and fleeing troops (some were evacuated by ''[[USS YAG-4|YAG-4]]'' from the [[Mariveles Naval Section Base|Mariveles Naval Base]]).<ref name=NS-YAG4>{{Cite web|first= Joseph M.|last=  Radigan|authorlink=   |title=Service Ship Photo Archive YAG-4  |website=NavSource - Naval Source History|date= |url=http://www.navsource.org/archives/14/2004.htm |accessdate=March 13, 2020}}</ref> By 8 April, the senior U.S. commander on Bataan, Major General [[Edward P. King]], saw the futility of further resistance, and put forth proposals for capitulation.\n\nThe next morning, 9 April 1942, General King met with Major General Kameichiro Nagano and, after several hours of negotiations, the remaining weary, starving and emaciated American and Filipino defenders on the battle-swept Bataan Peninsula surrendered.\n\n'''Radio broadcast \u2013 Voice of Freedom \u2013 [[Malinta Tunnel]] \u2013 Corregidor \u2013 9 April 1942:'''\n\n{{quote|Bataan has fallen. The Philippine-American troops on this war-ravaged and bloodstained peninsula have laid down their arms. With heads bloody but unbowed, they have yielded to the superior force and numbers of the enemy.\n\nThe world will long remember the epic struggle that Filipino and American soldiers put up in the jungle fastness and along the rugged coast of Bataan. They have stood up uncomplaining under the constant and grueling fire of the enemy for more than three months. Besieged on land and blockaded by sea, cut off from all sources of help in the Philippines and in America, the intrepid fighters have done all that human endurance could bear.\n\nFor what sustained them through all these months of incessant battle was a force that was more than merely physical. It was the force of an unconquerable faith\u2014something in the heart and soul that physical hardship and adversity could not destroy. It was the thought of native land and all that it holds most dear, the thought of freedom and dignity and pride in these most priceless of all our human prerogatives.\n\nThe adversary, in the pride of his power and triumph, will credit our troops with nothing less than the courage and fortitude that his own troops have shown in battle. Our men have fought a brave and bitterly contested struggle. All the world will testify to the most superhuman endurance with which they stood up until the last in the face of overwhelming odds.\n\nBut the decision had to come. Men fighting under the banner of unshakable faith are made of something more than flesh, but they are not made of impervious steel. The flesh must yield at last, endurance melts away, and the end of the battle must come.\n\nBataan has fallen, but the spirit that made it stand\u2014a beacon to all the liberty-loving peoples of the world\u2014cannot fall!<ref>{{cite book|title=College Writing and Reading|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_dB4ArqrQ_wC|publisher=Rex Bookstore, Inc.|isbn=978-971-23-0571-9|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_dB4ArqrQ_wC&pg=PA327 327\u2013328]}}</ref>|}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Japanese Tank Bataan.jpg|Japanese tanks and infantry advance through the Bataan jungle.\nFile:BalangaBataanjf2836 07.JPG|Fall of Bataan historical marker, [[Bataan]], Capitolio\nFile:King discusses surrender.gif|MG [[Edward P.

However, the extension of time gained by the defence was very largely a result of the transfer of the 48th Division from Homma's army at a critical time, and the exhaustion of the weakened force that remained. It cost a far stronger Japanese army as many days of actual combat to take Malaya and Singapore Island as it cost Homma to take Bataan and Corregidor.<ref name=\"Long G 1969 p.83\">(Long G, \"MacArthur as Military Commander\" (1969), Angus and Robertson (Australia), p.83.)</ref>\n\nThe surrender of Bataan hastened the fall of [[Corregidor]] a month later. There is a suggestion that without the stand, the Japanese might have quickly overrun all of the U.S. bases in the Pacific and could have quickly invaded Australia.<ref>William L. O'Neill, ''A Democracy at War: America's Fight at Home and Abroad in World War II'', p 116 {{ISBN|0-02-923678-9}}</ref> Willoughby, MacArthur's Intelligence Officer, asserted after the war that the epic operation in Bataan and Corregidor became a decisive factor in the ultimate winning of the war, that it disrupted the Japanese timetable \"in a way that was to prove crucial\" and that \"because of Bataan the Japanese never managed to detach enough men, planes, ships, and material to nail down Guadalcanal.\" That assertion is contradicted by simple facts of history, geography and arithmetic. Rather than allowing the operations on Luzon to upset their general timetable, the Japanese took steps that resulted in prolonging the resistance of Luzon in order to speed up their conquest of the Indies. Between the time of their advance into the Solomons and the American counter-landing on Guadalcanal in August, three months after the fall of Corregidor, they had ample troops available to build up their strength in the South Seas.<ref name=\"Long G 1969 p.83\"/>\n\nHowever, historian Teodoro Agoncillo argues that the battle was \"unnecessary in so far as the throwing away of precious lives was concerned, for it served no strategic purpose.\" It was only Yamashita who thought of invading Australia, something that Tojo did not support. Finally, not only did the USAFFE possess numerical superiority, it could have recaptured Manila easily (according to Homma).<ref>{{Cite book|title=The fateful years : Japan's adventure in the Philippines, 1941\u201345|last=A.|first=Agoncillo, Teodoro|date=2001|publisher=University of the Philippines Press|isbn=9715422748|edition= 2001 |location=Quezon City|pages=851, 853|oclc=48220661}}</ref>\n\nUltimately, more than 60,000 Filipino and 15,000 American prisoners of war were forced into the [[Bataan Death March]].<ref name=\"William L.

On 7 September 1944, the Japanese ship ''[[SS Shiny\u014d Maru|Shiny\u014d Maru]]'' was sunk by [[USS Paddle (SS-263)|USS ''Paddle'']]; on board the ''Shinyo Maru'' were U.S. POWs, of whom 668 died and 82 survived.\n\nAfter more than two years of fighting in the Pacific, General [[Douglas MacArthur]] initiated [[Philippines Campaign (1944\u201345)|the Campaign for the Liberation of the Philippines]], fulfilling his promise to return to the country he had left in 1942. As part of the campaign, the [[Battle of Bataan (1945)|Battle for the recapture of Bataan]] (31 January to 21 February 1945) by Allied forces and Philippine guerrillas avenged the surrender of the defunct [[USAFFE|United States Armed Forces in the Far East]] (USAFFE) to invading Japanese forces.\n\n==Legacy==\n{{Further|Memorials to Bataan Death March victims}}\n''Araw ng Kagitingan'' (Day of Valour), 9 April, the day Bataan fell into Japanese hands, was declared a [[Public holidays in the Philippines|national holiday in the Philippines]].<ref>[http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2002/ra_9177_2002.html \"Republic Act no. 9188\"].

The battle represented the most intense phase of the Japanese [[Battle of the Philippines (1941\u201342)|invasion of the Philippines]] during World War II. In January 1942, forces of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Navy]] invaded [[Luzon]] along with several islands in the Philippine Archipelago after the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombing of the American naval base at Pearl Harbor]].\n\nThe commander-in-chief of all U.S. and Filipino forces in the islands, General [[Douglas MacArthur]], consolidated all of his Luzon-based units on the [[Bataan Peninsula]] to fight against the Japanese army. By this time, the Japanese controlled nearly all of Southeast Asia. The [[Bataan]] Peninsula and the island of [[Corregidor]] were the only remaining Allied strongholds in the region.\n\nDespite a lack of supplies, American and Filipino forces managed to fight the Japanese for three months, engaging them initially in a fighting retreat southward. As the combined American and Filipino forces made a last stand, the delay cost the Japanese valuable time and prevented immediate victory across the Pacific. The American surrender at Bataan to the Japanese, with 76,000 soldiers surrendering in the Philippines altogether,<ref name=imprisoned /> was the largest in [[Military history of the United States|American]] and [[Military history of the Philippines|Filipino military histories]], and was the largest United States surrender since the [[American Civil War]]'s [[Battle of Harpers Ferry|Battle of Harper's Ferry]].<ref>Robertson, p. 606.</ref> Soon afterwards, U.S. and Filipino [[prisoners of war]] were forced into the [[Bataan Death March]].<ref name=\"William L. O'Neill p 115\">William L. O'Neill, ''A Democracy at War: America's Fight at Home and Abroad in World War II'', p 115 {{ISBN|0-02-923678-9}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\nThe capture of the Philippine Islands was crucial to Japan's effort to control the Southwest Pacific, seize the [[Natural resource|resource]]-rich [[Dutch East Indies]], and protect its [[Southeast Asia]]n flank. After Japanese carrier planes [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked]] the [[United States Pacific Fleet]] at [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] on the morning of 7 December 1941 (8 December, [[Manila]] time), [[Taiwan]]-based aircraft, within seven hours, pounded the main bases of the American Far East Air Force at [[Clark Air Base|Clark Field]] in [[Pampanga]], Iba Field in [[Zambales]], [[Nichols Field]] near [[Manila]], and the headquarters of the [[United States Asiatic Fleet]] in the Philippines, at [[Cavite]]. Many American planes were caught on the ground and summarily destroyed. In one day, the Japanese had gained air superiority over the Philippine Islands. This forced the U.S. Asiatic Fleet to withdraw its surface ships from its naval base in Cavite and retreat southwards, leaving only the submarine force to resist the Japanese.\n\nFrom 8 to 10 December, scattered resistance by ground troops and remaining American air and naval forces failed to stop preliminary landings to seize airfields at [[Batan Island]], [[Aparri, Cagayan|Aparri]], and [[Vigan City]]. Army air force B-17s, often with little if any fighter escort, attacked Japanese ships offloading at Gonzaga and the Vigan landings on Luzon. Submarines of the Asiatic Fleet were also assigned to the effort.\n\nIn one last coordinated action by the Far East Air Force, U.S. planes damaged two Japanese transports, the [[Japanese battleship Nagato|flagship ''Nagato'']], and a destroyer, and sank one [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]]. These air attacks and naval actions, however, did not significantly delay the Japanese assault.\n\nThese small-scale landings preceded the main assault on 22 December 1941, at [[Lingayen Gulf]] in [[Pangasinan]] and Lamon Bay, [[Quezon|Tayabas]], by the 14th Japanese Imperial Army, led by Lieutenant General [[Masaharu Homma]].\n\nBy effectively neutralizing U.S. air and naval power in the Philippines, the Japanese gained supremacy that isolated the Philippines from reinforcement and resupply, and provided itself with both airfields for support of its invasion forces and staging bases for further operations in the Dutch East Indies.\n\n==War Plan Orange-3==\nWhen MacArthur returned to active duty, the latest revision plans for the defense of the Philippine Islands had been completed in April 1941 and was called WPO-3, based on the joint Army-Navy [[War Plan Orange]] of 1938, which involved hostilities between the United States and Japan.<ref name=Morton>{{cite book |title=The Fall of the Philippines |last=Morton |first=Louis |authorlink= |year=1953 |publisher=US Army Center of Military History |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> Under WPO-3, the Philippine garrison was to hold the entrance to Manila Bay and deny its use to Japanese naval forces and ground forces were to prevent enemy landings. If the enemy prevailed, they were to withdraw to the Bataan Peninsula, which was recognized as the key to the control of Manila Bay. It was to be defended to the \"last extremity\".<ref name=Morton /> In addition to the regular U.S. Army troops, the defenders could rely on the Philippine Army, which had been organized and trained by General MacArthur.<ref name=Morton />\n\nHowever, in April 1941, the Navy estimated that it would require at least two years for the Pacific Fleet to fight its way across the Pacific. Army planners in early 1941 believed supplies would be exhausted within six months and the garrison would fall.<ref name=Morton /> MacArthur assumed command of the Allied army in July 1941 and rejected WPO-3 as defeatist, preferring a more aggressive course of action.<ref name=Murphy>{{cite book |title=Inside the Bataan Death March: Defeat, Travail and Memory |last=Murphy |first=Kevin C. |authorlink= |year=2014 |publisher=McFarland |location= |isbn=978-0786496815 |pages=328 |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> He recommended\u2014among other things\u2014a coastal defense strategy that would include the entire archipelago. His recommendations were followed in the plan that was eventually approved.<ref name=Morton /> Due to MacArthur's decision, with tacit approval from Washington, to change the plan under [[United States color-coded war plans#Rainbow plans|War Plan Rainbow 5]], it was ordered that the entire archipelago would be defended, with the necessary supplies dispersed behind the beachheads for defending forces to use while defending against the landings. With the return to War Plan Orange 3, the necessary supplies to support the defenders for the anticipated six-month-long defensive position were not available in the necessary quantities for the defenders who would withdraw to Bataan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/70-7_06.htm |title=The Decision To Withdraw to Bataan |author=Louis Morton |date= |work=U.S. Army Center of Military History |publisher=[[United States Army]] |accessdate=22 May 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Battle==\nWhen the Japanese made their first landings on 10 and 12 December at the northern and southern extremities of Luzon, General MacArthur made no disposition to contest them. He correctly surmised that these landings were designed to secure advance air bases and that the Japanese had no intention of driving on Manila from any of these beachheads. He did not regard the situation as serious enough to warrant a change in his plan to oppose the main attack, when it came, with an all-out defense at the beaches. The MacArthur Plan, then, remained in effect.<ref name=Morton />\n\nOn December 20, US Navy submarine {{USS|Stingray|SS-186|6}} spotted a large convoy of troop ships with escorts. This was General Homma's landing force, and included 85 troop transports, two battleships, six cruisers, and two dozen destroyers. The convoy was engaged by three submarines: USS ''Stingray'', {{USS|Saury|SS-189|6}}, and {{USS|Salmon|SS-182|6}}, who fired torpedo after torpedo into the convoy, most of which failed to explode, due to the [[Mark XIV torpedo]]'s defective detonators. In all, just two troop ships were sunk before Japanese destroyers chased the submarines away.<ref name=herman>{{cite book |title=Douglas McArthur: American Warrior |last=Herman |first=Arthur |authorlink= |year=2016 |publisher=Random House Publishing Group |location= |isbn=978-0812994896 |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0812994892 |accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Fighting retreat===\n[[File:Manila declared open city.jpg|thumb|200px|Japanese troops occupy Manila, as it is declared an [[open city]] to avoid its destruction, 2 January 1942.]]\nGeneral MacArthur intended to move his men with their equipment and supplies in good order to their defensive positions. He charged the [[North Luzon Force]] under Maj. Gen. [[Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright IV]] with holding back the main Japanese assault and keeping the road to Bataan open for use by the [[South Luzon Force]] of Maj. Gen. [[George M. Parker (general)|George Parker]], which proceeded quickly and in remarkably good order, given the chaotic situation. To achieve this, Wainwright deployed his forces in a series of five defensive lines outlined in WPO-3:\n\n* D1: [[Aguilar, Pangasinan|Aguilar]] to [[San Carlos City, Pangasinan|San Carlos]] to [[Urdaneta City]]\n* D2: [[Agno River]]\n* D3: [[Santa Ignacia, Tarlac|Santa Ignacia]] to [[Gerona, Tarlac|Gerona]] to [[Guimba, Nueva Ecija|Guimba]] to San Jose\n* D4: [[Tarlac]] to [[Cabanatuan City]]\n* D5: [[Bamban, Tarlac|Bamban]] to Sibul Springs\n\n====Layac Line====\n[[File:DinalupihanBataajf2720 03.JPG|thumb|right|WWII First Line of Defense Memorial ([[Dinalupihan, Bataan]], [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippines]])]]\n\nThe main force of General [[Masaharu Homma]]'s 14th Area Army came ashore at Lingayen Gulf on the morning of 22 December. The defenders failed to hold the beaches. By the end of the day, the Japanese had secured most of their objectives and were in position to emerge onto the central plain.<ref name=Morton /> Facing Homma's troops were four Filipino divisions: the [[21st Division (Philippines)|21st]], the [[71st Division (Philippines)|71st]], the [[11th Division (Philippines)|11th]], and the [[91st Division (Philippines)|91st]], as well as a battalion of [[Philippine Scouts]] backed by a few tanks.<ref name=herman /> Along Route 3\u2014a cobblestone road that led directly to Manila<ref name=herman />\u2014the Japanese soon made contact with the Filipino 71st Division. At this point the action of the American artillery stalled the Japanese attack. However, Japanese planes and tanks entering the action routed the Filipino infantry, leaving the artillery uncovered.<ref name=Morton /> A second Japanese division landed at Lamon Bay, south of Manila, on December 23 and advanced north.<ref name=Darman>{{cite book |title=Attack on Pearl Harbor: America Enters World War II |last=Darman |first=Peter |year=2012 |publisher=Rosen Publishing |location= |isbn=978-1448892334 |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1448892333}}</ref>\n\nIt was now evident to General Wainwright that he could no longer hold back the Japanese advance. Late on the afternoon of the 23rd, Wainwright telephoned General MacArthur's headquarters in Manila and informed him that any further defense of the Lingayen beaches was \"impracticable.\" He requested and was given permission to withdraw behind the Agno River.<ref name=Morton /> MacArthur weighed two choices: either make a firm stand on the line of the Agno and give Wainwright his best unit, the [[Philippine Division]], for a counterattack; or withdraw all the way to Bataan in planned stages. He decided on the latter, thus abandoning his own plan for defense and reverting to the old ORANGE plan. Having made his decision to withdraw to Bataan, MacArthur notified all force commanders on the night of 23 December that \"WPO-3 is in effect.\"<ref name=Morton />\n\nMeanwhile, [[Manuel L. Quezon]], the President of the Philippine Commonwealth, together with his family and government staff were evacuated to Corregidor, along with MacArthur's [[United States Army Forces in the Far East]] (USAFFE) headquarters, on the night of 24 December 1941, while all USAFFE military personnel were removed from the major urban areas. On the 26th Manila was officially declared an [[open city]] and MacArthur's proclamation was published in the newspapers and broadcast over the radio. The Japanese were not notified officially of the proclamation but learned of it through radio broadcasts. The next day, and thereafter, they bombed the port area, from which supplies were being shipped to Bataan and Corregidor.<ref name=Morton />\n\n[[File:Layac Junction Jan 1942.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|Defense of the Layac Junction approach to Bataan 2\u20136 January 1942]]\nAfter General Douglas MacArthur had withdrawn his army down the island of Luzon's central plain into the [[Bataan Peninsula]], one last line existed before the Japanese invaders reached the main line of resistance. The Americans attempted to slow the Japanese entry into [[Bataan]] by fighting a delaying action at Layac, thus gaining time and deceiving the enemy as to the location of the main defensive positions. For the first time in World War II, American troops faced Japanese soldiers on the ground.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n====Porac\u2013Guagua Line====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Dinalupihanjf3140.JPG|thumb|Historical Marker (6 January 1942)]]\nFrom 1 to 5 January 1942, as the entire USAFFE converged from south and north, delaying actions were fought to allow the struggling withdrawal to Bataan. The fiercest fighting occurred at the hastily emplaced Porac\u2013Guagua Line, where the 11th and 21st divisions, respectively led by Brigadier Generals [[William E. Brougher]] and [[Mateo Capinpin]], with the [[26th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|26th Cavalry Regiment]] of Colonel Clinton A. Pierce in reserve, held the line, mostly on open and unprepared ground, against massive aerial and artillery bombardment, strong tank assaults, and infantry [[Banzai charge|banzai attack]]s by the Takahashi and Tanaka detachments. Both sides suffered heavy casualties.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\nOverlooked in this report are the actions of the 23rd Infantry Regiment of the PA, led by senior instructor Col. Wallace A Mead. The 23rd Regiment established the defensive line at Porac-Pampanga on or around 2 January 1942. Colonel Mead was later awarded the [[Silver Star]] for his actions there. The 23rd's defense allowed Capinpin's forces to withdraw and establish new defensive positions. It was Capinpin's recount of the fighting that day that was offered as support for Mead's citation.\n\n====Abucay\u2013Mauban Line====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Abucay Line.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Abucay Line 9\u201323 January 1942]]\nWar Plan Orange 3 called for two defensive lines across Bataan. The first extended across the peninsula from Mauban in the west to Mabatang, Abucay in the east. General Wainwright, commanding the newly organised I Philippine Corps of 22,500 troops, held the western sector. I Corps included the Philippine Army's [[1st Infantry Division (Philippines)|1st Regular]], [[31st Division (Philippines)|31st]], and [[91st Division (Philippines)|91st Divisions]], the 26th Cavalry (Philippine Scouts (PS)) and a battery of field artillery and self-propelled guns. General Parker and the new II Philippine Corps, which included the Philippine Army's 11th, 21st, [[41st Division (Philippines)|41st]], and [[51st Division (Philippines)|51st divisions]] and the [[57th Infantry Regiment (United States)|57th Infantry]] (PS), and numbered 25,000 men, defended the eastern sector. All of the divisions, already under strength at the onset of war, had suffered serious combat losses, particularly to desertions. The U.S. Army's Philippine Division, made up of the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|31st Infantry]], the [[45th Infantry Regiment (United States)|45th Infantry]] (PS), and supporting units became the \"Bataan Defense Force Reserve\". Mount Natib, a {{convert|4222|ft|m|adj=on}}-high mountain that split the peninsula, served as the boundary line between the two corps. The commanders anchored their lines on the mountain, but, since they considered the rugged terrain impassable, they did not extend their forces far up its slopes. The two corps were therefore not in direct contact with each other, leaving a serious gap in the defense line. With the fighting withdrawal completed, the Abucay\u2013Mauban Line, the USAFFE's main battle position was now in place.\n\n===Stand===\n[[File:Mauban Line.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Mauban Line positions 18\u201325 January 1942]]\n\nOn 9 January, Japanese forces under Lieutenant General Susumu Morioka assaulted the eastern flank of the Abucay\u2013Mauban Line, and were repulsed by the 91st Division of Brigadier General Luther Stevens and Colonel George S. Clark's 57th Infantry (PS). On 12 January, amid fierce fighting, 2nd Lieutenant [[Alexander R. Nininger]], a platoon leader in the 57th Infantry, sacrificed his life when, armed with only a rifle and [[hand grenades]], he forced his way into enemy foxholes during [[hand-to-hand combat]], permitting his unit to retake Abucay Hacienda; for his actions, he was [[posthumous recognition|posthumously awarded]] the [[Medal of Honor]]. Another extreme act of bravery was put forth by a Filipino named Narcisco Ortilano.<ref name=\"None More Courageous - American War Heroes of Today\"/> He was on a [[M1917 Browning machine gun|water-cooled heavy machine gun]] when the Japanese burst out of a canebrake in a banzai attack. He shot dozens of the Japanese with his machine gun, then pulled out his Colt .45 and shot five more when the machine gun jammed. Then, when one Japanese soldier stabbed at him with a bayonet, he desperately tried to grab the gun, got his thumb cut off, but still held on, and then with a sudden burst of adrenaline he turned the gun on the enemy soldier and stabbed him in the chest. When another Japanese soldier swung a bayonet at him, he turned his rifle on the soldier and shot him dead. Narcisco received the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]].<ref name=\"None More Courageous - American War Heroes of Today\">{{citation | title = None More Courageous \u2013 American War Heroes of Today| url = https://books.google.com/?id=ODIN0EU9yLUC&pg=PA197&lpg=PA197&dq=narcisco+ortilano#v=onepage&q=narcisco%20ortilano&f=false| publisher = Stewart H.

Jones]], respectively, aided by the 43rd and Colonel Wallace A Mead's 23rd Infantry, stubbornly refused the Japanese their left flank. The Japanese advanced to the Salian River Valley through a gap made by the 51st Infantry's withdrawal. But a patrol discovered the infiltration, and units of the 21st Division rushed to the valley and repulsed the attackers after a savage encounter.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAt another engagement farther to the west, a Japanese force surprised and routed the 53rd Infantry of Colonel John R. Boatwright. This force also penetrated deep behind the Abucay\u2013Mauban Line along the Abo-Abo River Valley, but their advance was held up by combined units of the 21st and 51st Divisions, the 31st Division of Brigadier General [[Clifford Bluemel]], and Colonel John H. Rodman's 92nd Infantry at the Bani-Guirol Forest area. The 31st Infantry and the 45th Infantry, Philippine scouts of Colonel Thomas W. Doyle, partially restored the abandoned line of the 51st Division.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nOn 15 January, the reinforced 1st Regular Division of Brigadier General Fidel Segundo, defending the Morong sector, came under heavy bombardment, but held the line. The Japanese penetrated through a huge gap in the Silangan-Natib area and established a roadblock on Mauban Ridge, threatening to cut off the division's rear. Repeated attacks by the 91st Division and 71st Division, and 92nd Infantry failed to dislodge the Japanese. The attackers' nightly raids and infiltration tactics became more frequent. Previously, General Parker's II Corps had prevented a similar encirclement at the Salian River battle, but the position of General Wainwright's I Corps was deemed indefensible, and the Abucay\u2013Mauban Line was abandoned on 22 January.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n====Battle of Trail Two====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:jia flame throw bataan.jpg|thumb|300px|Japanese flamethrower in action against a bunker on the Orion-Bagac Line]]\nWithin four days, the Orion-Bagac Line was formed. But the defenders had yet to complete their withdrawal to the reserve battle position when the Japanese struck again, through a gap held by I Corps. General Bluemel hastily organized a defense along Trail Two, consisting of 32nd Infantry, 41st Infantry and 51st Division reinforcements, in time to stop a major offensive and plug the gap.\n\n====Battle of the Pockets====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\n[[File:Orion-Bagac Line.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|The Orion\u2013Bagac line showing the U.S. positions around 27 January 1942]]\nThe remaining Japanese troops managed to get through, however, and held out at some rear sectors of the Orion-Bagac Line at the Tuol River Valley behind the 11th Division, and in the Gogo-Cotar River behind the 1st Regular Division. From 23 January to 17 February, coordinated action by the defenders to eliminate these salients of resistance became known as the \"Battle of the [[Pocket (military)|pockets]]\". Fierce fighting marked the action. Captain [[Alfredo M. Santos]], of the 1st Regular Division, outmaneuvered the enemy during their attempt to pocket the area. In both attempts, his unit successfully broke through the Gogo-Cotar and Tuol pockets, thus earning for himself the moniker \"hero of the pockets\". For his successes, he was promoted to major in the field. Major [[Alfredo M. Santos|Santos]] was then given the hazardous mission of closing the gaps and annihilating the enemy troops who had infiltrated the lines, as the gap posed a serious threat to the positions and the security of the division. He led a counterattack against the strong and numerically superior Japanese forces positioned between the MLR and the Regimental Reserve Line (RRL). The fighting began at dawn on 29 January 1942, and the Americans restored the defensive sector assigned to the 1st Regular Division. On 3 February 1942, 1st Lieutenant [[Willibald C. Bianchi]] of the 45th Infantry, Philippine scouts, led a reinforced platoon forward against two enemy machine-gun nests, silenced them with grenades, and then manned an antiaircraft machine gun until dying of his wounds. His Medal of Honor was awarded posthumously. Of the 2,000 Japanese soldiers engaged, 377 were reported to have escaped.\n\n[[File:Bataan Pockets Jan Feb 1942.jpg|thumb|250 px|Battle of the Pockets on the Orion-Bagac Line]]\nGeneral Homma, on 8 February, ordered the suspension of offensive operations in order to reorganize his forces. This could not be carried out immediately, because the 16th Division remained engaged trying to extricate the pocketed 3rd Battalion, 20th Infantry. With further casualties, the remnants of the 3rd Battalion, 378 officers and men, were extricated on 15 February. On 22 February, the 14th Army line was withdrawn a few miles to the north, with USAFFE forces re-occupying positions evacuated by the Japanese.\n\n====Battle of the Points====\n[[File:CMH FoTP-Map 13.jpg|thumb|Japanese landings on Bataan 23 January \u2013 1 February 1942]]\n\nIn an attempt to outflank I Corps and isolate the service command area commanded by USAFFE deputy commander Brigadier General Allan C. McBride, Japanese troops of the 2nd Battalion, 20th Infantry, 16th Division, were landed on the west coast of southern Bataan on the night of 22 January. Intercepted by U.S. [[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-34|PT-34]], two barges were sunk and the rest scattered in two groups, neither of which landed on the objective beach. The Japanese forces were contained on their beachheads by members of Philippine constabulary units, a hastily organized naval infantry battalion, and by personnel of several [[United States Army Air Corps|U.S. Army Air Corps]] pursuit squadrons fighting as infantry, including [[Ed Dyess]] and [[Ray C. Hunt]].<ref name=Dyess>Dyess, W.E., 1944, The Dyess Story, New York: G.P.

Sailors used the Canopus machine shop to fabricate makeshift mountings for [[machine gun]]s salvaged from Patrol Wing Ten's damaged aircraft. The Marines were distributed through the ranks, and the sailors were told to \"watch them and do as they do.\" The sailors attempted to make their white uniforms more suitable for jungle combat by dying them with coffee grounds. The result was closer to yellow than khaki, and the diary of a dead Japanese officer described them as a suicide squad dressed in brightly colored uniforms and talking loudly in an attempt to draw fire and reveal the enemy positions.<ref name=\"proceedings\">Gordon, John IV, Capt. USA \"The Navy's Infantry at Bataan\" ''United States Naval Institute Proceedings Supplement'' March 1985 pp.64\u201369</ref>\n\nJapanese commanders, in an attempt to hold onto their lodgements, reinforced the beachheads piecemeal, but could not break out. Battles were fought ferociously against a company-sized group at the Lapay-Longoskawayan points from 23 to 29 January, at the Quinawan-Aglaloma points from 22 January to 8 February, and at the Silalim-Anyasan points from 27 January to 13 February. Out of the 2,000 Japanese troops committed to these battles, only 43 wounded returned to their lines. These engagements were collectively termed the \"Battle of the Points\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Fall of Bataan===\nOn the night of 12 March, General MacArthur, his family, and several USAFFE staff officers [[Douglas MacArthur's escape from the Philippines|left Corregidor]] for [[Mindanao]] aboard four [[PT boat]]s commanded by Lieutenant Commander [[John D. Bulkeley]]. For this, and a number of other feats over the course of four months and eight days, Bulkeley was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]], the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]], the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] and other citations.\n\nMacArthur was eventually flown to Australia where he broadcast to the [[Filipino people]] his famous \"I Shall Return\" promise. MacArthur's departure marked the end of the USAFFE, and by 22 March, the defending army was renamed the United States Forces in the Philippines (USFIP), and Lieutenant General [[Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright IV]] was placed in command.\n\nAfter the failure of their first attack against Bataan, the Japanese general headquarters sent strong artillery forces to the Philippines in order to smash the American fortifications. They had 190 artillery pieces, which included bigger guns like 150&nbsp;mm cannons and the rare [[Type 45 240&nbsp;mm howitzer]]. The 1st Artillery headquarters, under Major General Kineo Kitajima, who was a known authority on IJA artillery, also moved to the Philippines along with the main forces to command and control these artillery units. Also, the Japanese high command reinforced General Homma's 14th Imperial Army, and toward the end of March, the Japanese forces prepared for the final assault.\n\nOn 3 April, the entire Orion-Bagac Line was subjected to incessant bombings by 100 aircraft and artillery bombardment by 300 artillery pieces from 9:00&nbsp;a.m. to 3:00&nbsp;pm, which turned the [[Mount Samat]] stronghold into an inferno. Over the course of the next three days ([[Good Friday]] to [[Easter|Easter Sunday]], 1942), the Japanese 65th Brigade and 4th Division spearheaded the main attack at the left flank of II Corps. Everywhere along the line, the American and Filipino defenders were driven back by Japanese tanks and infantry.\n\nBased on his two prior attempts, General Homma had estimated that the final offensive would require a week to breach the Orion-Bagac Line and a month to liquidate two final defense lines he believed had been prepared on Bataan. When the opening attack required just three days, he pushed his forces on 6 April to meet expected counterattacks head-on. The Japanese launched a drive into the center, penetrated into flanks held by the 22nd and 23rd Regiments of the 21st Division, captured Mount Samat and outflanked all of II Corps. Counterattacks by the U.S. Army and Philippine Scout regulars held in reserve were futile; only the 57th Infantry gained any ground, soon lost.\n\nAll along the battle front, units of I Corps, together with the devastated remnants of II Corps, crumbled and straggled to the rear. The commanders on Bataan lost all contact with their units, except by runner in a few instances. In the last two days of the defense of Bataan, the entire Allied defense progressively disintegrated and collapsed, clogging all roads with refugees and fleeing troops (some were evacuated by ''[[USS YAG-4|YAG-4]]'' from the [[Mariveles Naval Section Base|Mariveles Naval Base]]).<ref name=NS-YAG4>{{Cite web|first= Joseph M.|last=  Radigan|authorlink=   |title=Service Ship Photo Archive YAG-4  |website=NavSource - Naval Source History|date= |url=http://www.navsource.org/archives/14/2004.htm |accessdate=March 13, 2020}}</ref> By 8 April, the senior U.S. commander on Bataan, Major General [[Edward P. King]], saw the futility of further resistance, and put forth proposals for capitulation.\n\nThe next morning, 9 April 1942, General King met with Major General Kameichiro Nagano and, after several hours of negotiations, the remaining weary, starving and emaciated American and Filipino defenders on the battle-swept Bataan Peninsula surrendered.\n\n'''Radio broadcast \u2013 Voice of Freedom \u2013 [[Malinta Tunnel]] \u2013 Corregidor \u2013 9 April 1942:'''\n\n{{quote|Bataan has fallen. The Philippine-American troops on this war-ravaged and bloodstained peninsula have laid down their arms. With heads bloody but unbowed, they have yielded to the superior force and numbers of the enemy.\n\nThe world will long remember the epic struggle that Filipino and American soldiers put up in the jungle fastness and along the rugged coast of Bataan. They have stood up uncomplaining under the constant and grueling fire of the enemy for more than three months. Besieged on land and blockaded by sea, cut off from all sources of help in the Philippines and in America, the intrepid fighters have done all that human endurance could bear.\n\nFor what sustained them through all these months of incessant battle was a force that was more than merely physical. It was the force of an unconquerable faith\u2014something in the heart and soul that physical hardship and adversity could not destroy. It was the thought of native land and all that it holds most dear, the thought of freedom and dignity and pride in these most priceless of all our human prerogatives.\n\nThe adversary, in the pride of his power and triumph, will credit our troops with nothing less than the courage and fortitude that his own troops have shown in battle. Our men have fought a brave and bitterly contested struggle. All the world will testify to the most superhuman endurance with which they stood up until the last in the face of overwhelming odds.\n\nBut the decision had to come. Men fighting under the banner of unshakable faith are made of something more than flesh, but they are not made of impervious steel. The flesh must yield at last, endurance melts away, and the end of the battle must come.\n\nBataan has fallen, but the spirit that made it stand\u2014a beacon to all the liberty-loving peoples of the world\u2014cannot fall!<ref>{{cite book|title=College Writing and Reading|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_dB4ArqrQ_wC|publisher=Rex Bookstore, Inc.|isbn=978-971-23-0571-9|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_dB4ArqrQ_wC&pg=PA327 327\u2013328]}}</ref>|}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Japanese Tank Bataan.jpg|Japanese tanks and infantry advance through the Bataan jungle.\nFile:BalangaBataanjf2836 07.JPG|Fall of Bataan historical marker, [[Bataan]], Capitolio\nFile:King discusses surrender.gif|MG [[Edward P.

However, the extension of time gained by the defence was very largely a result of the transfer of the 48th Division from Homma's army at a critical time, and the exhaustion of the weakened force that remained. It cost a far stronger Japanese army as many days of actual combat to take Malaya and Singapore Island as it cost Homma to take Bataan and Corregidor.<ref name=\"Long G 1969 p.83\">(Long G, \"MacArthur as Military Commander\" (1969), Angus and Robertson (Australia), p.83.)</ref>\n\nThe surrender of Bataan hastened the fall of [[Corregidor]] a month later. There is a suggestion that without the stand, the Japanese might have quickly overrun all of the U.S. bases in the Pacific and could have quickly invaded Australia.<ref>William L. O'Neill, ''A Democracy at War: America's Fight at Home and Abroad in World War II'', p 116 {{ISBN|0-02-923678-9}}</ref> Willoughby, MacArthur's Intelligence Officer, asserted after the war that the epic operation in Bataan and Corregidor became a decisive factor in the ultimate winning of the war, that it disrupted the Japanese timetable \"in a way that was to prove crucial\" and that \"because of Bataan the Japanese never managed to detach enough men, planes, ships, and material to nail down Guadalcanal.\" That assertion is contradicted by simple facts of history, geography and arithmetic. Rather than allowing the operations on Luzon to upset their general timetable, the Japanese took steps that resulted in prolonging the resistance of Luzon in order to speed up their conquest of the Indies. Between the time of their advance into the Solomons and the American counter-landing on Guadalcanal in August, three months after the fall of Corregidor, they had ample troops available to build up their strength in the South Seas.<ref name=\"Long G 1969 p.83\"/>\n\nHowever, historian Teodoro Agoncillo argues that the battle was \"unnecessary in so far as the throwing away of precious lives was concerned, for it served no strategic purpose.\" It was only Yamashita who thought of invading Australia, something that Tojo did not support. Finally, not only did the USAFFE possess numerical superiority, it could have recaptured Manila easily (according to Homma).<ref>{{Cite book|title=The fateful years : Japan's adventure in the Philippines, 1941\u201345|last=A.|first=Agoncillo, Teodoro|date=2001|publisher=University of the Philippines Press|isbn=9715422748|edition= 2001 |location=Quezon City|pages=851, 853|oclc=48220661}}</ref>\n\nUltimately, more than 60,000 Filipino and 15,000 American prisoners of war were forced into the [[Bataan Death March]].<ref name=\"William L.

As part of the campaign, the [[Battle of Bataan (1945)|Battle for the recapture of Bataan]] (31 January to 21 February 1945) by Allied forces and Philippine guerrillas avenged the surrender of the defunct [[USAFFE|United States Armed Forces in the Far East]] (USAFFE) to invading Japanese forces.\n\n==Legacy==\n{{Further|Memorials to Bataan Death March victims}}\n''Araw ng Kagitingan'' (Day of Valour), 9 April, the day Bataan fell into Japanese hands, was declared a [[Public holidays in the Philippines|national holiday in the Philippines]].<ref>[http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2002/ra_9177_2002.html \"Republic Act no. 9188\"].

In 1986, Leung worked for [[Kowloon Motor Bus]] as an overnight vehicle cleaner. Around 1988, he formed the [[April Fifth Action]] after the Revolutionary Marxist League was disbanded. The group is well known for its aggressive and [[civil disobedience]]-style actions to protest against the governments of China and Hong Kong during celebrations and visits of state leaders, often resulting in confrontations with the [[Hong Kong police]]. They usually carry a coffin as their trademark protest prop. Leung supported the [[Tiananmen protest of 1989]] and has been member of the [[Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China]].\n\nHe has been briefly jailed several times for offences such as shouting from [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] (LegCo) public viewing gallery, burning the [[Flag of the People's Republic of China|national flag of the People's Republic of China]] and forcibly breaking into an opposition political event. In 2000, he and Koo Sze-yiu were prosecuted for disrupting a LegCo meeting and were later jailed for 14 days, becoming the first dissents to be jailed after the handover of Hong Kong in 1997.

He called out the DAB as the \"loyalist party\" and received 1,149, only 284 short to defeat Choy.\n\nLeung ran again in the [[2004 Hong Kong Legislative Council election|Legislative Council election]] in 2004 in New Territories East and succeeded in winning a seat in LegCo with 60,925 votes at the expense of the moderate [[Andrew Wong Wang-fat|Andrew Wong]], former [[President of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council President]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.elections.gov.hk/elections/legco2004/english/results/rs_gc_nt_e.html |title=Election results in 2004 |access-date=3 July 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107023438/http://www.elections.gov.hk/elections/legco2004/english/results/rs_gc_nt_e.html |archive-date=7 November 2005 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> He received over 200% increase in votes compared to the 18,235 votes in 2000.<ref>[http://www.elections.gov.hk/elections/legco2000/update/result/index_e.htm#ne Election result in 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222030811/http://www.elections.gov.hk/elections/legco2000/update/result/index_e.htm |date=22 February 2012 }}</ref> His campaigns include [[universal suffrage]], workers' rights and welfare for the less well off. His political agenda include introduction of a liveable [[minimum wage]], comprehensive social security, [[collective bargaining]] and taxing speculative business. Although he expresses his fondness for [[Che Guevara]] and the ideals of revolutionary [[Marxism]], Leung has not included a proletarian revolution agenda on his election platform and many of his ideas and proposals would be readily accepted by most mainstream social liberal and social democratic parties in other countries.\n\nFor the swearing-in ceremony of the Hong Kong Legislative Council on 6 October 2004, Leung's fellow members arrived in business attire. He, in contrast, wore a T-shirt with [[Tiananmen Square]] on the front and [[Che Guevara]] on the back. When he was called to come forward and take the oath, he raised his left fist, encircled with a black wristband, a memorial to those who died in the 1989 protests. He had planned to alter his oath of office, but a Hong Kong judge said such a step would make it impossible for him to serve. Instead, Leung added his own messages to the standard oath, demanding vindication for those killed in the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, calling for the release of political prisoners and an end to [[One-party state|one-party rule]] on the Mainland. He shouted at the ceremony: \"Long live democracy! Long live the people!\" He was then sworn in as a council member. Observers watched closely the reaction from the PRC government, as Leung's statements touched upon a politically sensitive issue that is considered taboo in official public settings. Leung's populist and unorthodox confrontational style contrasts with the usually restrained atmosphere of LegCo. [[Rita Fan]], the then LegCo President, seemed more concerned by Leung's attire for LegCo meetings than any of his political opinions. One legislator commented that \"LegCo has to get used to Leung, and he has to get used to LegCo.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/13/opinion/long-hair-and-the-legislature-in-hong-kong.html \"Long Hair and the Legislature in Hong Kong\"], Eleanor Randolph, ''[[The New York Times]]'', 13 October 2004</ref>\n\nIn 2005, Leung took part in the protests against the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 2005|WTO Conference in Hong Kong]] and was injured during the demonstration.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Leung was arrested along with 900 other demonstrators. As with almost all other persons rounded up on that day, Leung was released shortly after and was not prosecuted.\n\nIn 2006, Leung co-founded the social democratic party [[League of Social Democrats]] (LSD) with legislator [[Albert Chan]] and radical pro-democrat radio host [[Wong Yuk-man]]. In the [[2008 Hong Kong legislative election|2008 Legislative Council election]], Leung was re-elected in the New Territories East while Chan and Wong were also elected in [[New Territories West (constituency)|New Territories West]] and [[Kowloon West (constituency)|Kowloon West]] respectively which made the LSD in the third largest pro-democracy party after [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]] and [[Civic Party]], which took a more moderate and pro-middle class position as compared to the LSD.\n\n==Denied entry to Sichuan in 2008==\nLeung has not had a [[Home Return Permit]] since 1989, after the [[Tiananmen Massacre]], having been denied one by the Chinese authorities, but he was able to visit the mainland China once in the company of his mother in about 2003.<ref name=20150830SCMP/> He was also able to visit the mainland China in 2005, due to at that time all Hong Kong legislators were invited to visit [[Guangdong]], including other pan-democrat legislators, some of them also do not have the permit since 1989.\n\nOn 4 July 2008 Leung was scheduled to visit areas in [[Sichuan]] damaged by the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake|Sichuan earthquake]] as part of a 20-member delegation.

Leung explained that his resignation in January was, \"in keeping with [his] campaign promise... to fight for direct elections.\"<ref name=\"resignation\">{{Cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8480260.stm |title=Hong Kong lawmakers quit in push for democracy |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=26 January 2010 |accessdate=26 January 2010}}</ref> Although being elected in May with 108,927 votes, the campaign failed to draw high turnout rate due to the boycott by the pro-Beijing camp, . Leung accused the Democratic Party for not participating in the campaign and instead reached a controversial agreement with the Beijing government over the [[2010 Hong Kong electoral reform|reform proposal]].\n\nIn the [[2011 Hong Kong local elections|2011 District Council elections]], LSD chairman [[Andrew To]] refused to field candidates against the Democrats and former chairman Wong Yuk-man and legislator Albert Chan quit the party with hundreds party members over the disagreement as well as the intra-party factional struggles. Leung, being the only legislator left in the party refused to follow Wong and Chan. Leung subsequently took over as party chairman after To resigned when he lost his seat in the District Council elections. Leung himself also ran in the election against DAB legislator [[Ip Kwok-him]] in his stronghold [[Kwun Lung (constituency)|Kwun Lung]] but lost with a wide margin of 1,800 votes.\n\nAfter the 2010 by-election, the government considered the resignations were abusive to the system and planned to plug the loophole. A [[Legislative Council (Amendment) Bill 2012]] was proposed to disqualify a resigned member of the Legislative Council from participating in a subsequent by-election. Leung participated in the filibustering against the bill with Albert Chan and Wong Yuk-man, submitting 1,306 amendments altogether, which began the radical democrats' filibustering practice against the government bills in the following years. On morning of 17 May 2012, LegCo President [[Jasper Tsang]], adopted Article 92 of the Standing Order, which allows the president follow foreign parliament rules for unregulated behaviours to terminate the debate. In the end, all amendments were defeated and the Bill was passed on 1 June 2012.\n\n==Third term as Legislative Councillor==\nIn the [[2012 Hong Kong legislative election|2012 Legislative Council election]], with 48,295 votes, among the highest votes in the constituency.

After the [[National People's Congress Standing Committee]] (NPCSC) set the [[831 decision|restrictive framework]] on the Chief Executive candidates, the student activist groups organised a [[2014 Hong Kong class boycott campaign|week-long student strike]]. On 26 September 2014 toward the end of the strike, 100 protesters led by student leader [[Joshua Wong Chi-fung|Joshua Wong]] rushed into the square of the government headquarters. The police clearance drew thousands of protesters at the scene. In the next morning, the [[Occupy Central with Peace and Love]] led by scholar [[Benny Tai]] announced their early launch of the planned occupy protests. Feeling being highjacked, some protesters began to leave the scene, while Leung Kwok-hung dropped to his knees in front of the protesters, asking them for staying in the scene. \"If you want to achieve a goal in the long term \u2013 in this case, true democracy in Hong Kong \u2013 you need to unify all powers who are fighting for this goal and establish a platform to let them all participate\", he later told the press.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg--hong-kong-protests-20141030-story.html|title=Prominent Hong Kong activist says protesters need to unify, strategize|date=30 October 2014|work=LA Times}}</ref> For his long term experiences in protests, he became one of the leaders in the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]] and kept being seen in the scene, but he was criticised by some militant radicals for his non-violence doctrine.\n\nIn [[2016 Hong Kong legislative election|2016 Legislative Council election]] Leung was once again re-elected with 35,595 votes. Leung came in ninth in the nine-seat constituency, with only 1,051 votes separating him from the unelected [[Christine Fong]] due to the infighting among the pan-democracy camp and surges of many [[localism in Hong Kong|localist]] candidates with more radical agenda.<ref>http://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking-news.php?id=79252</ref>\n\n==Oath-taking controversy and disqualification==\n{{main|Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy}}\nAt the inaugural meeting of the [[6th Legislative Council of Hong Kong|6th Legislative Council]] on 12 October, he took the oath-taking ceremony as his protest platform like his previous oaths. He wore a black t-shirt with the word \"civil disobedience\" in Chinese and held an opened yellow umbrella symbolising the [[Umbrella Revolution]] with many words thereon, including \"ending the [[one-party rule]]\", and a paper board showing the words \"[[National People's Congress|NPC]] [[831 decision]]\" and a cross on it. He paused many times while reading the oath and tore a piece of paper with the words with the words \"NPC 831 decision\". His oath was validated by the clerk.<ref>{{cite web|title=IN THE HIGH COURT OF THE HONG KONG SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGION COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE CONSTITUTIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE LAW LIST NO 224 OF 2016|url=http://legalref.judiciary.hk/lrs/common/ju/ju_frame.jsp?DIS=110350&currpage=T}}</ref>\n\nHowever, after the oaths of the two [[localism in Hong Kong|localist]] legislators [[Sixtus Leung]] and [[Yau Wai-ching]] of [[Youngspiration]] were invalidated by the clerk, the duo were unprecedentedly legally challenged by [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Leung Chun-ying]] and [[Secretary for Justice (Hong Kong)|Secretary for Justice]] [[Rimsky Yuen]]. On 7 November 2016, the [[National People's Congress Standing Committee]] (NPCSC) interpreted of the Article 104 of the [[Basic Law of Hong Kong]], standardising the manners of the oath-taking when taking public office. As a result, the duo were disqualified by the court. Subsequently, the government launched a second legal action against Leung and three other pro-democracy legislators, [[Lau Siu-lai]], [[Yiu Chung-yim]] and [[Nathan Law]], which resulted in their disqualifications from the Legislative Council on 14 July 2017.<ref name=\"TIME\"/>\n\n==2017 Chief Executive bid==\n{{main|2017 Hong Kong Chief Executive election}}\nLeung Kwok-hung launched his Chief Executive bid in February 2017 through a \"public nomination\" mechanism conducted by post-Occupy group Citizens United in Action, in which he would seek to secure 37,790 votes from members of the public, one per cent of the city's registered voters before he would canvass for the nominations from the Election Committee. He explained his decision was to urge the pro-democrat electors not to vote for any pro-establishment candidates who could not represent the pro-democracy camp at all even if they see them as \"lesser evils\", as some pro-democrats had inclined to support John Tsang, the relatively liberal pro-establishment candidate to prevent a hardliner Carrie Lam from winning. He also aimed to reflect the spirit of the 2014 Umbrella Movement and the voice of those low-income people. His bid was supported by four radical democrat legislators [[People Power (Hong Kong)|People Power]]'s [[Raymond Chan Chi-chuen|Raymond Chan]], [[Demosisto]]'s [[Nathan Law]], [[Lau Siu-lai]] and [[Eddie Chu]], while the mainstream pro-democrats cast doubt over Leung's candidacy, believing it would contribute to the victory to Carrie Lam.<ref>{{cite news|title='Long Hair' Leung Kwok-hung enters chief executive race, urging allies not to vote for 'lesser evils'|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/2069091/long-hair-leung-kwok-hung-enters-ce-race-urging-allies-not-vote|date=8 February 2017|newspaper=South China Morning Post}}</ref>\n\nOn 25 February, Leung announced he would not run for the Chief Executive, as he only secured 20,234 nominations from the general public, about 17,000 fewer than the threshold.

In 2014, his hair was forcibly cropped short when he was briefly imprisoned for criminal damage for his forced entry at a political event. In 2015, he commenced an application for Judicial Review before the High Court, challenging the Commissioner for Correctional Services' power to rule that male prisoners' hair be cut short while females are permitted to grow theirs to any length, on the ground of gender discrimination in breach of the HKSAR's constitution.

In 1986, Leung worked for [[Kowloon Motor Bus]] as an overnight vehicle cleaner. Around 1988, he formed the [[April Fifth Action]] after the Revolutionary Marxist League was disbanded. The group is well known for its aggressive and [[civil disobedience]]-style actions to protest against the governments of China and Hong Kong during celebrations and visits of state leaders, often resulting in confrontations with the [[Hong Kong police]]. They usually carry a coffin as their trademark protest prop. Leung supported the [[Tiananmen protest of 1989]] and has been member of the [[Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China]].\n\nHe has been briefly jailed several times for offences such as shouting from [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] (LegCo) public viewing gallery, burning the [[Flag of the People's Republic of China|national flag of the People's Republic of China]] and forcibly breaking into an opposition political event. In 2000, he and Koo Sze-yiu were prosecuted for disrupting a LegCo meeting and were later jailed for 14 days, becoming the first dissents to be jailed after the handover of Hong Kong in 1997. Before that he had been charged for 14 times, 11 of which were convicted.<ref>{{cite news|title=\u6881 \u570b \u96c4 \u5373 \u6642 \u5165 \u7344 14 \u5929 |url=http://std.stheadline.com/archive/fullstory.asp?andor=or&year1=2000&month1=5&day1=27&year2=2000&month2=5&day2=27&category=all&id=20000527a11&keyword1=&keyword2=|newspaper=Sing Tao Daily|date=27 May 2000}}</ref>\n\n==Legislative Council bids and founding of LSD==\nLeung first contested in the [[2000 Hong Kong legislative election|Legislative Council election in 2000]], where he ran in the [[New Territories East (constituency)|New Territories East]]. He received 18,235 votes, about six percent of the total vote share and was not elected. On 1 July 2003 the unpopular [[Tung Chee-hwa]] administration attracted more than 500,000 people marched in the streets. The further antagonism towards the government helped further boost the popularity of pro-democracy activists including Leung Kwok-hung. In the [[2003 Hong Kong local elections|2003 District Council election]], Leung challenged the [[pro-Beijing camp|pro-Beijing]] [[Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong]] (DAB) legislator [[Choy So-yuk]]'s seat in the [[Kam Ping (constituency)|Kam Ping constituency]] which was seen as pro-Beijing traditional stronghold. He called out the DAB as the \"loyalist party\" and received 1,149, only 284 short to defeat Choy.\n\nLeung ran again in the [[2004 Hong Kong Legislative Council election|Legislative Council election]] in 2004 in New Territories East and succeeded in winning a seat in LegCo with 60,925 votes at the expense of the moderate [[Andrew Wong Wang-fat|Andrew Wong]], former [[President of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council President]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.elections.gov.hk/elections/legco2004/english/results/rs_gc_nt_e.html |title=Election results in 2004 |access-date=3 July 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107023438/http://www.elections.gov.hk/elections/legco2004/english/results/rs_gc_nt_e.html |archive-date=7 November 2005 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> He received over 200% increase in votes compared to the 18,235 votes in 2000.<ref>[http://www.elections.gov.hk/elections/legco2000/update/result/index_e.htm#ne Election result in 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222030811/http://www.elections.gov.hk/elections/legco2000/update/result/index_e.htm |date=22 February 2012 }}</ref> His campaigns include [[universal suffrage]], workers' rights and welfare for the less well off. His political agenda include introduction of a liveable [[minimum wage]], comprehensive social security, [[collective bargaining]] and taxing speculative business. Although he expresses his fondness for [[Che Guevara]] and the ideals of revolutionary [[Marxism]], Leung has not included a proletarian revolution agenda on his election platform and many of his ideas and proposals would be readily accepted by most mainstream social liberal and social democratic parties in other countries.\n\nFor the swearing-in ceremony of the Hong Kong Legislative Council on 6 October 2004, Leung's fellow members arrived in business attire. He, in contrast, wore a T-shirt with [[Tiananmen Square]] on the front and [[Che Guevara]] on the back. When he was called to come forward and take the oath, he raised his left fist, encircled with a black wristband, a memorial to those who died in the 1989 protests. He had planned to alter his oath of office, but a Hong Kong judge said such a step would make it impossible for him to serve. Instead, Leung added his own messages to the standard oath, demanding vindication for those killed in the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, calling for the release of political prisoners and an end to [[One-party state|one-party rule]] on the Mainland. He shouted at the ceremony: \"Long live democracy! Long live the people!\" He was then sworn in as a council member. Observers watched closely the reaction from the PRC government, as Leung's statements touched upon a politically sensitive issue that is considered taboo in official public settings. Leung's populist and unorthodox confrontational style contrasts with the usually restrained atmosphere of LegCo. [[Rita Fan]], the then LegCo President, seemed more concerned by Leung's attire for LegCo meetings than any of his political opinions. One legislator commented that \"LegCo has to get used to Leung, and he has to get used to LegCo.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/13/opinion/long-hair-and-the-legislature-in-hong-kong.html \"Long Hair and the Legislature in Hong Kong\"], Eleanor Randolph, ''[[The New York Times]]'', 13 October 2004</ref>\n\nIn 2005, Leung took part in the protests against the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 2005|WTO Conference in Hong Kong]] and was injured during the demonstration.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Leung was arrested along with 900 other demonstrators. As with almost all other persons rounded up on that day, Leung was released shortly after and was not prosecuted.\n\nIn 2006, Leung co-founded the social democratic party [[League of Social Democrats]] (LSD) with legislator [[Albert Chan]] and radical pro-democrat radio host [[Wong Yuk-man]]. In the [[2008 Hong Kong legislative election|2008 Legislative Council election]], Leung was re-elected in the New Territories East while Chan and Wong were also elected in [[New Territories West (constituency)|New Territories West]] and [[Kowloon West (constituency)|Kowloon West]] respectively which made the LSD in the third largest pro-democracy party after [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]] and [[Civic Party]], which took a more moderate and pro-middle class position as compared to the LSD.\n\n==Denied entry to Sichuan in 2008==\nLeung has not had a [[Home Return Permit]] since 1989, after the [[Tiananmen Massacre]], having been denied one by the Chinese authorities, but he was able to visit the mainland China once in the company of his mother in about 2003.<ref name=20150830SCMP/> He was also able to visit the mainland China in 2005, due to at that time all Hong Kong legislators were invited to visit [[Guangdong]], including other pan-democrat legislators, some of them also do not have the permit since 1989.\n\nOn 4 July 2008 Leung was scheduled to visit areas in [[Sichuan]] damaged by the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake|Sichuan earthquake]] as part of a 20-member delegation.

Leung explained that his resignation in January was, \"in keeping with [his] campaign promise... to fight for direct elections.\"<ref name=\"resignation\">{{Cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8480260.stm |title=Hong Kong lawmakers quit in push for democracy |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=26 January 2010 |accessdate=26 January 2010}}</ref> Although being elected in May with 108,927 votes, the campaign failed to draw high turnout rate due to the boycott by the pro-Beijing camp, . Leung accused the Democratic Party for not participating in the campaign and instead reached a controversial agreement with the Beijing government over the [[2010 Hong Kong electoral reform|reform proposal]].\n\nIn the [[2011 Hong Kong local elections|2011 District Council elections]], LSD chairman [[Andrew To]] refused to field candidates against the Democrats and former chairman Wong Yuk-man and legislator Albert Chan quit the party with hundreds party members over the disagreement as well as the intra-party factional struggles. Leung, being the only legislator left in the party refused to follow Wong and Chan. Leung subsequently took over as party chairman after To resigned when he lost his seat in the District Council elections. Leung himself also ran in the election against DAB legislator [[Ip Kwok-him]] in his stronghold [[Kwun Lung (constituency)|Kwun Lung]] but lost with a wide margin of 1,800 votes.\n\nAfter the 2010 by-election, the government considered the resignations were abusive to the system and planned to plug the loophole. A [[Legislative Council (Amendment) Bill 2012]] was proposed to disqualify a resigned member of the Legislative Council from participating in a subsequent by-election. Leung participated in the filibustering against the bill with Albert Chan and Wong Yuk-man, submitting 1,306 amendments altogether, which began the radical democrats' filibustering practice against the government bills in the following years. On morning of 17 May 2012, LegCo President [[Jasper Tsang]], adopted Article 92 of the Standing Order, which allows the president follow foreign parliament rules for unregulated behaviours to terminate the debate. In the end, all amendments were defeated and the Bill was passed on 1 June 2012.\n\n==Third term as Legislative Councillor==\nIn the [[2012 Hong Kong legislative election|2012 Legislative Council election]], with 48,295 votes, among the highest votes in the constituency.

After the [[National People's Congress Standing Committee]] (NPCSC) set the [[831 decision|restrictive framework]] on the Chief Executive candidates, the student activist groups organised a [[2014 Hong Kong class boycott campaign|week-long student strike]]. On 26 September 2014 toward the end of the strike, 100 protesters led by student leader [[Joshua Wong Chi-fung|Joshua Wong]] rushed into the square of the government headquarters. The police clearance drew thousands of protesters at the scene. In the next morning, the [[Occupy Central with Peace and Love]] led by scholar [[Benny Tai]] announced their early launch of the planned occupy protests. Feeling being highjacked, some protesters began to leave the scene, while Leung Kwok-hung dropped to his knees in front of the protesters, asking them for staying in the scene. \"If you want to achieve a goal in the long term \u2013 in this case, true democracy in Hong Kong \u2013 you need to unify all powers who are fighting for this goal and establish a platform to let them all participate\", he later told the press.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg--hong-kong-protests-20141030-story.html|title=Prominent Hong Kong activist says protesters need to unify, strategize|date=30 October 2014|work=LA Times}}</ref> For his long term experiences in protests, he became one of the leaders in the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]] and kept being seen in the scene, but he was criticised by some militant radicals for his non-violence doctrine.\n\nIn [[2016 Hong Kong legislative election|2016 Legislative Council election]] Leung was once again re-elected with 35,595 votes. Leung came in ninth in the nine-seat constituency, with only 1,051 votes separating him from the unelected [[Christine Fong]] due to the infighting among the pan-democracy camp and surges of many [[localism in Hong Kong|localist]] candidates with more radical agenda.<ref>http://www.thestandard.com.hk/breaking-news.php?id=79252</ref>\n\n==Oath-taking controversy and disqualification==\n{{main|Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy}}\nAt the inaugural meeting of the [[6th Legislative Council of Hong Kong|6th Legislative Council]] on 12 October, he took the oath-taking ceremony as his protest platform like his previous oaths. He wore a black t-shirt with the word \"civil disobedience\" in Chinese and held an opened yellow umbrella symbolising the [[Umbrella Revolution]] with many words thereon, including \"ending the [[one-party rule]]\", and a paper board showing the words \"[[National People's Congress|NPC]] [[831 decision]]\" and a cross on it. He paused many times while reading the oath and tore a piece of paper with the words with the words \"NPC 831 decision\". His oath was validated by the clerk.<ref>{{cite web|title=IN THE HIGH COURT OF THE HONG KONG SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGION COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE CONSTITUTIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE LAW LIST NO 224 OF 2016|url=http://legalref.judiciary.hk/lrs/common/ju/ju_frame.jsp?DIS=110350&currpage=T}}</ref>\n\nHowever, after the oaths of the two [[localism in Hong Kong|localist]] legislators [[Sixtus Leung]] and [[Yau Wai-ching]] of [[Youngspiration]] were invalidated by the clerk, the duo were unprecedentedly legally challenged by [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Leung Chun-ying]] and [[Secretary for Justice (Hong Kong)|Secretary for Justice]] [[Rimsky Yuen]]. On 7 November 2016, the [[National People's Congress Standing Committee]] (NPCSC) interpreted of the Article 104 of the [[Basic Law of Hong Kong]], standardising the manners of the oath-taking when taking public office. As a result, the duo were disqualified by the court. Subsequently, the government launched a second legal action against Leung and three other pro-democracy legislators, [[Lau Siu-lai]], [[Yiu Chung-yim]] and [[Nathan Law]], which resulted in their disqualifications from the Legislative Council on 14 July 2017.<ref name=\"TIME\"/>\n\n==2017 Chief Executive bid==\n{{main|2017 Hong Kong Chief Executive election}}\nLeung Kwok-hung launched his Chief Executive bid in February 2017 through a \"public nomination\" mechanism conducted by post-Occupy group Citizens United in Action, in which he would seek to secure 37,790 votes from members of the public, one per cent of the city's registered voters before he would canvass for the nominations from the Election Committee. He explained his decision was to urge the pro-democrat electors not to vote for any pro-establishment candidates who could not represent the pro-democracy camp at all even if they see them as \"lesser evils\", as some pro-democrats had inclined to support John Tsang, the relatively liberal pro-establishment candidate to prevent a hardliner Carrie Lam from winning. He also aimed to reflect the spirit of the 2014 Umbrella Movement and the voice of those low-income people. His bid was supported by four radical democrat legislators [[People Power (Hong Kong)|People Power]]'s [[Raymond Chan Chi-chuen|Raymond Chan]], [[Demosisto]]'s [[Nathan Law]], [[Lau Siu-lai]] and [[Eddie Chu]], while the mainstream pro-democrats cast doubt over Leung's candidacy, believing it would contribute to the victory to Carrie Lam.<ref>{{cite news|title='Long Hair' Leung Kwok-hung enters chief executive race, urging allies not to vote for 'lesser evils'|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/2069091/long-hair-leung-kwok-hung-enters-ce-race-urging-allies-not-vote|date=8 February 2017|newspaper=South China Morning Post}}</ref>\n\nOn 25 February, Leung announced he would not run for the Chief Executive, as he only secured 20,234 nominations from the general public, about 17,000 fewer than the threshold.

His long hair has become one of his visual icons and a [[political statement]] \u2013 the same name was applied to troops of the [[Taiping Rebellion]] against Imperial China. In 2014, his hair was forcibly cropped short when he was briefly imprisoned for criminal damage for his forced entry at a political event. In 2015, he commenced an application for Judicial Review before the High Court, challenging the Commissioner for Correctional Services' power to rule that male prisoners' hair be cut short while females are permitted to grow theirs to any length, on the ground of gender discrimination in breach of the HKSAR's constitution.

In [[1916]] he comissioned sculptor [[Josep Clar\u00e0|Josep Clar\u00e0 i Ayats]] (1878-1958) to sculpt a version of ''Serenity'' for the main patio of his villa in Sitges<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mirabent|first=Isabel Coll|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=HWA6XZdGV4oC&pg=PA233&lpg=PA233&dq=serenity+clara+deering&source=bl&ots=G-5oC3AGAc&sig=ACfU3U1U8SWovvtJT3VX-eRwT5nt4gTVnQ&hl=ca&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiwgYSft7PoAhXBxYUKHfB4AcMQ6AEwC3oECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=serenity&f=false|title=Charles Deering and Ram\u00f3n Casas / Charles Deering Y Ram\u00f3n Casas: A Friendship in Art / Una Amistad en El Arte|date=2012-11-30|publisher=Northwestern University Press|isbn=978-0-8101-2843-9|language=en}}</ref>, known as [http://museusdesitges.cat/en/museum/palau-de-maricel/palau-de-maricel Palau de Maricel].

His work involved [[found object]]s, textile banners, [[drawing]]s, [[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]], [[collage]], [[Performance art|performance]] and [[Video art|video]]. He often worked collaboratively and had produced projects with artists [[Paul McCarthy]], [[Tony Oursler]] and [[John Miller (Art History professor)|John Miller]]. Writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', in 2012, [[Holland Cotter]] described the artist as \"one of the most influential American artists of the past quarter century and a pungent commentator on American class, popular culture and youthful rebellion.\"<ref name=\"Cotter\" />\n\n==Early life==\nKelley was born in [[Wayne, Michigan]], a suburb of [[Detroit]], to a [[working class]] Roman Catholic family in October 1954. His father was in charge of maintenance for a public school system; his mother was a cook in the executive dining room at [[Ford Motor Company]].<ref name=\"Cotter\" /> In his early years he was involved with the city's music scene, which spawned bands such as [[The Stooges|Iggy and the Stooges]], and was a member of the noise band [[Destroy All Monsters (band)|Destroy All Monsters]]. In 1976, Kelley graduated from the [[University of Michigan]] and then moved to [[Los Angeles]]. In 1978 he graduated from the [[California Institute of the Arts]] with a [[Master of Fine Arts]], where he admired the work of his teachers [[John Baldessari]], [[Laurie Anderson (performance artist)|Laurie Anderson]], [[David Askevold]] and [[Douglas Huebler]].\n\n==Work==\nDuring his time at CalArts, Kelley started to work on a series of projects in which he explored works with loose poetic themes, such as ''The Sublime'', ''Monkey Island'' and ''Plato's Cave, Rothko's Chapel, Lincoln's Profile'', using a variety of different media such as drawing, painting, sculpture, performance, video, and writing. In the 1980s he became known for working with another type of\nmaterial: crocheted blankets, fabric dolls and other rag toys found at thrift stores and yard sales.

His father was in charge of maintenance for a public school system; his mother was a cook in the executive dining room at [[Ford Motor Company]].<ref name=\"Cotter\" /> In his early years he was involved with the city's music scene, which spawned bands such as [[The Stooges|Iggy and the Stooges]], and was a member of the noise band [[Destroy All Monsters (band)|Destroy All Monsters]]. In 1976, Kelley graduated from the [[University of Michigan]] and then moved to [[Los Angeles]]. In 1978 he graduated from the [[California Institute of the Arts]] with a [[Master of Fine Arts]], where he admired the work of his teachers [[John Baldessari]], [[Laurie Anderson (performance artist)|Laurie Anderson]], [[David Askevold]] and [[Douglas Huebler]].\n\n==Work==\nDuring his time at CalArts, Kelley started to work on a series of projects in which he explored works with loose poetic themes, such as ''The Sublime'', ''Monkey Island'' and ''Plato's Cave, Rothko's Chapel, Lincoln's Profile'', using a variety of different media such as drawing, painting, sculpture, performance, video, and writing. In the 1980s he became known for working with another type of\nmaterial: crocheted blankets, fabric dolls and other rag toys found at thrift stores and yard sales. Perhaps the most famous work in this vein, ''[http://collection.whitney.org/object/7317 More Love Hours Than Can Ever Be Repaid and The Wages of Sin]'' from 1987, featured a mess of used rag dolls, animals and blankets strewn across a canvas, a way of investing a fictional childhood scene with some visceral pathos which was first shown at [[Rosamund Felsen Gallery]] in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324678604578340322829104276 | title=?? | work=The Wall Street Journal}} {{subscription}}</ref> In 1988, Kelley created an installation called ''Pay for Your Pleasure,'' which featured a gallery of portraits of men of genius \u2014 poets, philosophers and artists included \u2014 subverted at the end by a painting created by a convicted criminal.<ref name=\"articles.latimes.com\">Jori Finkel (February 2, 2012), [http://articles.latimes.com/2012/feb/02/local/la-me-mike-kelley-20120202 Mike Kelley dies at 57; L.A. contemporary artist] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.</ref> In ''From My Institution to Yours'' (1988) and ''Proposal for the Decoration of an Island of Conference Rooms'' (1992),  Kelly appropriated photocopied drawings and other [[ephemera]] of vernacular [[office humor]] and moved it into more formalized environments where such crude materials are normally not seen.<ref>[http://www.renaissancesociety.org/site/Exhibitions/Intro.Mike-Kelley-Three-Projects-Half-a-Man-From-My-Institution-to-Yours-and-Pay-for-Your-Pleasure.110.html \"Mike Kelley, Three Projects: Half a Man, From My Institution to Yours, and Pay for Your Pleasure\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512001752/http://www.renaissancesociety.org/site/Exhibitions/Intro.Mike-Kelley-Three-Projects-Half-a-Man-From-My-Institution-to-Yours-and-Pay-for-Your-Pleasure.110.html |date=May 12, 2013 }}, [[Renaissance Society]], May 1988.</ref><ref>Doug Harvey, [http://www.laweekly.com/2003-12-11/supplement/don-t-look-back/ \"Don't Look Back: Mike Kelley's Proposal\"], ''[[LA Weekly]]'', December 11, 2003.</ref>\n\nKelley often employed soft, tangled toys as a satirical metaphor for [[Expressionist art]].

Recitation will not only help eliminate one's negative karma; it will also bring strength, wisdom and inner peace, so that one can overcome all kinds of obstacles. The three major sutras and mantras recited by Guan Yin Citta followers are: [[N\u012blaka\u1e47\u1e6dha Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b|the Great Compassion Mantra]], the [[Heart Sutra]], and the Eighty-eight Buddhas Repentance.<ref>{{cite book |last= |first= |date= |title=Guan Yin Citta Dharma Door |url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_Rz2U4PrI50VU1xUi1JZkxSVEE/view |location= |publisher= |page=7 |isbn=}}</ref>\n#Practicing life liberation: that is, Release of animals, especially those in grave danger of being killed, is a popular practice performed by all schools of [[Buddhism]]. Guan Yin Citta believes that setting animals free helps one cultivate compassion towards all beings, and deepens the understanding that all living beings are all interdependent.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://lujunhong2or.com/%E7%B2%BE%E5%BD%A9%E5%BC%80%E7%A4%BA%E4%B8%93%E9%A2%98%EF%BC%9A%E6%95%91%E5%BD%BC%E5%91%BD%EF%BC%8C%E6%95%91%E5%B7%B1%E5%BF%83%EF%BC%88%E4%B8%8A%EF%BC%89-%E6%94%BE%E7%94%9F%E7%9A%84|title=\u6551\u5f7c\u547d\uff0c\u6551\u5df1\u5fc3\u2014\u2014\u653e\u751f\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027}}</ref>\n#Making great vows: When one makes a vow, he or she will be motivated to fulfill the vow.

It will be good enough as long as you have the heart and soul to create a better place for all beings. That is why I respect the Dharma. It doesn't matter which Dharma you choose; it will still be the path that you have to proceed. This is a very important point. Therefore, Chinese in Sydney will practice vegetarian during the first and the fifteenth of the Chinese calendar. There are also a lot of Chinese worshipping the Buddha during festive seasons. Some even know how to practice loving kindness. A few organizations in Sydney such as the [[Tzu Chi Foundation]], [[Pure Land Buddhism]] by Master [[Chin Kung]] and also Master [[Hsing Yun]]'s [[Nan Tien temple]] are all well established with the same priority, and that is to carry forward the Buddhism Teaching in order to unite everyone physically, mentally and soulfully. Hence, I believe that every Buddhist Chinese from all over the world should continue to practice Buddhism as it will benefit in the cultivation of One's mindset, and also to create a peaceful and harmonious world.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rfi.fr/cn/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD/20120718-%E8%87%AA%E5%BA%A6%E5%BA%A6%E4%BA%BA-%E9%87%87%E8%AE%BF%E6%BE%B3%E6%B4%B2%E5%8D%8E%E4%BA%BA%E4%BD%9B%E6%95%99%E5%AD%A6%E4%BC%9A%E5%8D%A2%E5%86%9B%E5%AE%8F%E4%BC%9A%E9%95%BF|title=\u4e2d\u534e\u4e16\u754c - \u81ea\u5ea6\u6e21\u4eba-\u91c7\u8bbf\u6fb3\u6d32\u534e\u4eba\u4f5b\u6559\u5b66\u4f1a\u5362\u519b\u5b8f\u4f1a\u957f|date=18 July 2012|website=RFI - \u6cd5\u56fd\u56fd\u9645\u5e7f\u64ad\u7535\u53f0}}</ref>\n\n==Philanthropy==\nIn 2014, Jun Hong Lu established the Australia Oriental Media Buddhist Charity Association (AOMB). AOMB reaches out to people suffering from mental illnesses, raises money for adults and children with disabilities and organises charitable events to support disaster relief efforts around the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aombca.org/%E6%9C%BA%E6%9E%84%E7%AE%80%E4%BB%8B|title=\u6fb3\u6d32\u4e1c\u65b9\u4f20\u5a92\u79ef\u5584\u673a\u6784}}</ref>\n\n== Criticism ==\nThe Guan Yin Citta Dharma Door created by Lu Jun Hong had claim itself that it is part of Buddhism. However, it is criticized by the public and other religious organization that Lu's teaching are unrelated to [[Buddhism]]. One of the example pointed out by the religious specialist which is the Guan Yin Citta Dharma Door teaches the believer to burn the yellow paper, known as \"Little house\". It was pointed out that there is no such teaching in [[Buddhism]] and therefore it is unrelated. Sales of these \"Little House\" along with donations has allegedly illegally gained millions of yuan per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.facts.org.cn/Recommendations/201711/13/t20171113_5829162.htm}}</ref>\n\nLu had several awards and speeches listed on his personal website that have no evidence or unreliable sources to support his claims. These included: a talk at [[Harvard University]] in September 2012, awards from the UK-based Unity of Faiths Foundation, the prize of \"Ambassador of World Peace\" from the UN, keynote speaker in the US Congress on March 26, 2014 along with several donations to disaster relief efforts.\n\nLu Jun Hong is criticized for making use of the religious belief for making himself famous and encourage believers to worship him. By printing his photo and name, as well as phrases to praise Lu Jun Hong on the flyer to conduct a mass advertising campaign.\n\nLu are also criticized for forcing the believers to donate money to fund his activities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.itisalllie.com/|title=World Zhengxin Buddhist Association|website=en.itisalllie.com|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref>\n\nLu's teachings have also encouraged sick believers to read scripture rather than receive medical attention. This includes believers with cancer, AIDS, infertility and mental illness.\n\n=== Malaysia Buddhism organization's reaction ===\nOn 28 December 2018, 9 Buddhism organizations from [[Malaysia]] declared that Lu Jun Hong's Guan Yin Citta belief does not match Buddhism's teaching, and urged the public to avoid attending Lu's Guan Yin Citta religious event.

It will be good enough as long as you have the heart and soul to create a better place for all beings. That is why I respect the Dharma. It doesn't matter which Dharma you choose; it will still be the path that you have to proceed. This is a very important point. Therefore, Chinese in Sydney will practice vegetarian during the first and the fifteenth of the Chinese calendar. There are also a lot of Chinese worshipping the Buddha during festive seasons. Some even know how to practice loving kindness. A few organizations in Sydney such as the [[Tzu Chi Foundation]], [[Pure Land Buddhism]] by Master [[Chin Kung]] and also Master [[Hsing Yun]]'s [[Nan Tien temple]] are all well established with the same priority, and that is to carry forward the Buddhism Teaching in order to unite everyone physically, mentally and soulfully. Hence, I believe that every Buddhist Chinese from all over the world should continue to practice Buddhism as it will benefit in the cultivation of One's mindset, and also to create a peaceful and harmonious world.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rfi.fr/cn/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD/20120718-%E8%87%AA%E5%BA%A6%E5%BA%A6%E4%BA%BA-%E9%87%87%E8%AE%BF%E6%BE%B3%E6%B4%B2%E5%8D%8E%E4%BA%BA%E4%BD%9B%E6%95%99%E5%AD%A6%E4%BC%9A%E5%8D%A2%E5%86%9B%E5%AE%8F%E4%BC%9A%E9%95%BF|title=\u4e2d\u534e\u4e16\u754c - \u81ea\u5ea6\u6e21\u4eba-\u91c7\u8bbf\u6fb3\u6d32\u534e\u4eba\u4f5b\u6559\u5b66\u4f1a\u5362\u519b\u5b8f\u4f1a\u957f|date=18 July 2012|website=RFI - \u6cd5\u56fd\u56fd\u9645\u5e7f\u64ad\u7535\u53f0}}</ref>\n\n==Philanthropy==\nIn 2014, Jun Hong Lu established the Australia Oriental Media Buddhist Charity Association (AOMB).
