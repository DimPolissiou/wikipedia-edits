It enjoys the rare distinction of being one of the few natural golf courses in Asia. Not only is the Shillong Golf Course scenic and enjoyable, it is also challenging. A group of British civil service officers introduced golf to Shillong in 1898 by constructing a nine-hole course. The present 18-hole course was inaugurated in 1924. The course is set in a valley covered with pine and rhododendron trees. The tight fairways, carpeted with a local grass which hardens the soil, are difficult to negotiate. The number of out-of-bounds streams that criss-cross every fairway makes it all the more trying. Obstructions come in the form of bunkers, trees and rain. The longest hole is the 6th, which is a grueling 594 yards. Shillong Golf Course is considered to be the \"[[Gleneagles Hotel|Glen Eagle]] of the East\" at the [[United States Golf Association Museum]]. It was set in a valley at an altitude of 5200&nbsp;ft in 1898 as a nine-hole course and later converted into an 18-hole course in 1924 by [[Captain Jackson]] and [[C. K. Rhodes]].\n*'''Motphran''': The \"Stone of France\" which is locally known as \"Motphran\" was erected in memory of the 26th Khasi Labour Corps who served under the British in France during World War I.
