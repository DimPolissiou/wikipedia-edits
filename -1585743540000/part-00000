Morgan Thomas]]'s comic book character [[Sheena, Queen of the Jungle]], which previously spawned a 1950s TV series of the same title; this turn-of-the-millennium version updated its title character to the 21st century. There were two seasons, containing 22 and 13 episodes. It starred [[Gena Lee Nolin]] and [[John Allen Nelson]], and was developed for television by [[Douglas Schwartz]] and [[Steven L. Sears]]. In this version, Sheena was given the mystical ability to transform into almost any jungle animal; she also spoke whole sentences (akin to [[Ron Ely]]'s [[Tarzan (1966 TV series)|Tarzan]]), unlike [[Irish McCalla]]'s interpretation of the character. Several episodes from the first season are available to view for free in [[The Minisode Network|Minisode]] format on [[Crackle (company)|Crackle]], as well as on [[Hulu]].hello sheena u kutthi\n\n==Premise==\nSheena's parents were archaeologists who died in the jungle when she was about six years old, orphaning their daughter Cheryl Hamilton (as explained in the episode \"Stranded in the Jungle\"; otherwise, Sheena remembers nothing of her parents, or of her pre-Africa childhood). She was taken in by Kali, a local Shamaness of a tribe who brought her up; five years ago, she was taught how to morph into birds and other animals, thus acquiring their abilities, up to and including flight. She also befriended animals such as [[zebra]] Marika, [[elephant]] Chango and [[monkey]] Tiki. Moreover, she became a mythical creature called \"The Darak'na\" who relies on people's fear of the unknown. For this, she covers herself in a dark liquid mud which allows her to be largely unseen in the low light of the jungle. With above-average strength, agility and speed\u2014and armed with a pair of bone-clawed gloves\u2014she is a formidable one-woman fighting force. She does kill sometimes.\n\nIn the first episode, she meets Matt Cutter ([[John Allen Nelson]]) who runs a safari business by air, water and land. In his youth, Cutter had a promising career as a football player till a knee injury ruined it (he has no apparent injury now). He joined the CIA, being code-named \"Jericho\" and fought as a mercenary. He was a first class sniper but an accident meant he killed an innocent person which caused him to abandon his old life for the life he now leads.\n\nOn their first meeting, Sheena is not sure what side Cutter is on, as she is a protector of the jungle and Cutter seems willing to do anything for money. He is unknowingly helping criminals. Within several episode, Cutter became more responsible, and less booze- and money-oriented. Sometimes there is chemistry between Sheena and Cutter, hinting at a development of their relationship, and at other times, the plotline appears to show a platonic friendship. This is notable in an episode where she meets an old \"Agency\" friend of Cutter's and a deeper level intimacy is suggested than in any of the scenes with Cutter.\n\nMendelsohn is a run-down buddy of Cutter's who services his plane and does odd jobs for him. The three come up against the local petty tyrant, would be dictators, small armies, a police officer who cannot wholly be trusted, evil tribesmen, evil foreigners, people from their past, assorted traps, etc.\n\n==Episodes==\n\n===Season 1 (2000\u201301)===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%; background:#fff;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#;\"| No.<br />overall\n! style=\"background:#;\"| No. in<br />season\n! style=\"background:#;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#;\"| Directed by\n! style=\"background:#;\"| Written by\n! style=\"background:#;\"| Original air date\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=1\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n |Title=Sheena\n |DirectedBy=[[Jon Cassar]]\n |WrittenBy=[[Steven L.

Sometimes there is chemistry between Sheena and Cutter, hinting at a development of their relationship, and at other times, the plotline appears to show a platonic friendship. This is notable in an episode where she meets an old \"Agency\" friend of Cutter's and a deeper level intimacy is suggested than in any of the scenes with Cutter.\n\nMendelsohn is a run-down buddy of Cutter's who services his plane and does odd jobs for him. The three come up against the local petty tyrant, would be dictators, small armies, a police officer who cannot wholly be trusted, evil tribesmen, evil foreigners, people from their past, assorted traps, etc.\n\n==Episodes==\n\n===Season 1 (2000\u201301)===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%; background:#fff;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#;\"| No.<br />overall\n! style=\"background:#;\"| No. in<br />season\n! style=\"background:#;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#;\"| Directed by\n! style=\"background:#;\"| Written by\n! style=\"background:#;\"| Original air date\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=1\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n |Title=Sheena\n |DirectedBy=[[Jon Cassar]]\n |WrittenBy=[[Steven L.

Some of them also described the song as a \"pop-electro-rock masterpiece\" and called it the best Sugababes single in years. Upon its release, \"About You Now\" became the group's sixth UK number one hit and highest-charting single since 2005's \"[[Push the Button (Sugababes song)|Push the Button]]\".

Written and produced by [[Dr. Luke]] along with [[Cathy Dennis]] and [[Steven Wolf]], it was released on 24 September 2007 by [[Island Records]] as the [[lead single]] from the album, the first to feature [[Amelle Berrabah]] on all tracks. An uptempo [[pop music|pop]] track that combines heavy elements of [[pop rock]], and [[dance-pop]], it infuses light [[electronic music|electronic sounds]]. Lyrically, \"About You Now\" finds the protagonist thinking deeply over her relationship with her [[love interest]] from whom she parted.\n\nThe song was generally well received by music critics, who complimented its genre mixing production as well as its aurally remarkable [[Mainstream Top 40|US pop]] influence. Some of them also described the song as a \"pop-electro-rock masterpiece\" and called it the best Sugababes single in years. Upon its release, \"About You Now\" became the group's sixth UK number one hit and highest-charting single since 2005's \"[[Push the Button (Sugababes song)|Push the Button]]\". It remained atop the [[UK Singles Chart]] for four weeks. It also reached the top of the charts in [[Hungary]], as well as the top ten in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Norway, and Spain. The Sugababes' highest-selling single to date, it has sold 540,500 copies as of October 2015.<ref name=\"UK sales\">{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/quiz-who-sold-more__11079/|title=Quiz: Who sold more?|last=Myers|first=Justin|date=24 October 2015|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=24 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n\"About You Now\" was nominated for a 2008 [[BRIT Award]] for Best British Single.
