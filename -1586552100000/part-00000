With a length (from the top of its head to the tip of its long pointed tail) of about one meter (3.3&nbsp;ft) it is longer than any other species of parrot. It is the largest [[macaw]] and the largest flying parrot species, though the flightless [[kakapo]] of New Zealand can outweigh it at up to 3.5&nbsp;kg. While generally easily recognized, it could be confused with the smaller [[Lear's macaw]].

Reported sightings of tool use in wild parrots go as far back as 1863. Examples of tool use that have been observed usually involve a chewed leaf or pieces of wood. Macaws often incorporate these items when feeding on harder nuts. Their use allows the nuts the macaws eat to remain in position (prevent slipping) while they gnaw into it. It is not known whether this is learned social behavior or an innate trait, but observation on captive macaws shows that hand-raised macaws exhibit this behavior, as well. Comparisons show that older macaws were able to open seeds more efficiently.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10071-004-0221-3|pmid=15248094|title=Preliminary observations of tool use in captive hyacinth macaws (''Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus'')|journal=Animal Cognition|volume=8|issue=1|pages=48\u201352|year=2004|last1=Borsari|first1=Andressa|last2=Ottoni|first2=Eduardo B.}}</ref>\n\n=== Reproduction ===\n[[File:Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus -Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil -nest-8 (3).jpg|right|thumb|A pair in their nest]]\nNesting takes place between July and December, with nests constructed in tree cavities or cliff faces depending on the habitat.<ref name=\"Birdlife\" /> In the Pantanal region, 90% of nests are constructed in the manduvi tree (''[[Sterculia apetala]]'').

Reported sightings of tool use in wild parrots go as far back as 1863. Examples of tool use that have been observed usually involve a chewed leaf or pieces of wood. Macaws often incorporate these items when feeding on harder nuts. Their use allows the nuts the macaws eat to remain in position (prevent slipping) while they gnaw into it. It is not known whether this is learned social behavior or an innate trait, but observation on captive macaws shows that hand-raised macaws exhibit this behavior, as well. Comparisons show that older macaws were able to open seeds more efficiently.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s10071-004-0221-3|pmid=15248094|title=Preliminary observations of tool use in captive hyacinth macaws (''Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus'')|journal=Animal Cognition|volume=8|issue=1|pages=48\u201352|year=2004|last1=Borsari|first1=Andressa|last2=Ottoni|first2=Eduardo B.}}</ref>\n\n=== Reproduction ===\n[[File:Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus -Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil -nest-8 (3).jpg|right|thumb|A pair in their nest]]\nNesting takes place between July and December, with nests constructed in tree cavities or cliff faces depending on the habitat.<ref name=\"Birdlife\" /> In the Pantanal region, 90% of nests are constructed in the manduvi tree (''[[Sterculia apetala]]'').

Additionally, propositions have been made to assess the effectiveness of artificial nest boxes, enforce legal measures preventing trade, and experiment with ecotourism at one or two sites to encourage donors.<ref name=IUCN /> Furthermore, the Hyacinth Macaw Project in Mato Grosso do Sul has carried out important research by ringing individual birds and has created a number of artificial nests to compensate for the small number of sites available in the region.<ref name=\"Hyacinth Macaw 2013\" /> Furthermore, proposals to list the species as Endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act have been made to further protective measures in the US and to create Bolivian and Paraguayan trade management authorities under presidential control.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n=== Long-term prospects ===\nEach of the three main populations should be managed as a separate biological entity so as to avoid numbers dropping below 500. While the birds may be in decline in the wild, notably higher populations of captive macaws are being held in zoos and private collections. If success in managing and replanting the macaw's food trees and erecting nest boxes as an experiment in the Pantanals is seen, the species could survive. Survival rates could also be enhanced if ranch owners would leave all large and potential nest trees standing and eliminate all trapping on their properties. Ultimately, should these factors work in tandem with erection of nest boxes, fencing off of certain saplings, and the planting of others, the long-term prospects of the hyacinth macaw species would be greatly improved.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"130px\">\nHyacinth macaws (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus) 2.jpg\nHyacinth macaw (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus) in flight.JPG\nFile:Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus -pet parrot-8a.jpg|Pet hyacinth macaw on arm\nFile:Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus -pet on bike handlebars-8.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of macaws]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n* {{Cite book |first=Joseph M. |last=Forshaw |authorlink=Joseph Forshaw |title=Parrots of the World; an Identification Guide |others=Illustrated by [[Frank Knight (artist)|Frank Knight]] |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=978-0-691-09251-5 |nopp=yes |year=2006 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/parrotsofworldid0000fors }}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons|Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus}}\n{{Wikispecies|Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus}}\n* [http://ibc.lynxeds.com/species/hyacinth-macaw-anodorhynchus-hyacinthinus Hyacinth macaw] on the Internet Bird Collection\n* {{ARKive}}\n* [http://www.bluemacaws.org/ The Blue Macaws website]\n* [http://www.macaw-facts.com/species/blue-macaw-hyacinth-macaw-hyacinthine-macaw/ In-Depth Blue Macaw Research]\n* [http://www.freesound.org/samplesViewSingle.php?id=56513 Audio File of the hyacinth macaw]\n\n{{Macaws}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q463154}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:macaw, hyacinth}}\n[[Category:Anodorhynchus|hyacinth macaw]]\n[[Category:Macaws|hyacinth macaw]]\n[[Category:Talking birds]]\n[[Category:Birds of the Cerrado]]\n[[Category:Birds of the Pantanal]]\n[[Category:Birds of Brazil]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Birds described in 1790|hyacinth macaw]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by John Latham (ornithologist)|hyacinth macaw]]\n[[Category:Species endangered by habitat loss]]\n[[Category:Species endangered by the pet trade]]\n", "name_user": "Simabkhani", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eReproduction)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyacinth_macaw"}

{"title_page": "Feminism in the United Kingdom", "text_new": "{{Feminism sidebar}}\nAs in other countries, '''feminism in the United Kingdom''' seeks to establish political, social, and economic equality for women. The history of feminism in Britain dates to the very beginnings of [[feminism]] itself, as many of the earliest feminist writers and activists\u2014such as [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], [[Barbara Bodichon]], and [[Lydia Becker]]\u2014were British.\n\n==19th century==\n{{main|History of women in the United Kingdom#19th century}}\n[[File:+Ann Thornton Going Aloft.jpg|thumb|160px|''[[Anne Jane Thornton|Ann Thornton]] Going Aloft'', ''c.'' 1835]]\nThe advent of the [[Reformism|reformist]] age during the 19th century meant that those invisible minorities or marginalised majorities were to find a catalyst and a microcosm in such new tendencies of reform. [[Robert Owen]], while asking for \"social reorganisation\", was laying down the basis of a new reformational background. One of those movements that took advantage of such new spirit was the [[feminist movement]]. The stereotype of the [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] gentle lady became unacceptable and even intolerable. The first organised movement for British women's suffrage was the [[Langham Place Circle]] of the 1850s, led by [[Barbara Bodichon]] (''n\u00e9e'' Leigh-Smith) and [[Bessie Rayner Parkes]]. They also campaigned for improved female rights in the law, employment, education, and marriage.\n\nProperty owning women and widows had been allowed to vote in some local elections, but that ended in 1835. The [[Chartist Movement]] of 1838 to 1857 was a large-scale demand for suffrage\u2014however it only gave suffrage to men over 21. In 1851 the [[Sheffield Female Political Association]] was founded and submitted an unsuccessful petition calling for women's suffrage to the House of Lords. This probably inspired British feminist [[Harriet Taylor Mill]] to write the pro-women's-suffrage ''[[The Enfranchisement of Women]]'' (1851).<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/taylor_harriet.shtml|title=BBC - History - Historic Figures: Harriet Taylor (1807 - 1858)}}</ref><ref name=\"Harriet Taylor Mill 1807 - 1858\">[http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/whm2003/ht_mill4.html Harriet Taylor Mill (1807 - 1858)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070414184944/http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/whm2003/ht_mill4.html |date=2007-04-14 }}</ref><ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web|url=http://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/awrm/doc15.htm|title=Harriet Taylor Mill, Enfranchisement of Women, 1851|website=womhist.alexanderstreet.com}}</ref> On June 7, 1866 a petition from 1,499 women calling for women's suffrage was presented to the Parliament, but it also did not succeed.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsehistory/2016/06/07/the-1866-womens-suffrage-petition/ |title=The 1866 women's suffrage petition &#124; LSE History |publisher=Blogs.lse.ac.uk |date=2016-06-12 |accessdate=2018-02-07}}</ref>\n\nUpper-class women could exert a little backstage political influence in high society. However, in divorce cases, rich women lost control of their children.\n\n===Careers===\nAmbitious middle-class women faced enormous challenges when they proposed entering suitable careers, such as nursing, teaching, law, and medicine, and the loftier their ambition, the greater the challenge. Physicians barred admission to the medical profession; there were a few opportunities for women lawyers, but none as clerics.<ref name=\"Hal\u00e9vy_500_506\">{{cite book | last = Hal\u00e9vy | first = \u00c9lie | title = A history of the English people | pages = 500\u2013506 | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}</ref> White collar business opportunities outside family-owned shops were few until clerical positions opened in the 20th century.  [[Florence Nightingale]] demonstrated the necessity of professional nursing and warfare, and set up an educational system that tracked women into that field in the second half of the nineteenth century.  Teaching was not quite as easy to break into, but the low salaries were less of the barrier to the single woman than to the married man.  By the late 1860s a number of schools were preparing women for careers as governesses or teachers. The census reported in 1851 that 70,000 women in England and Wales were teachers, compared to the 170,000 who comprised three-fourths of all teachers in 1901.<ref name=\"Hal\u00e9vy_500\">{{cite book | last = Hal\u00e9vy | first = \u00c9lie | title = A history of the English people | page = 500 | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Copelman | first = Dina | title = London's women teachers: gender, class and feminism, 1870-1930 | publisher = Routledge | location = London | year = 2014 | isbn = 9780415867528 }}</ref> The great majority came from lower middle class origins.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Coppock | first = David A. | title = Respectability as a prerequisite of moral character: the social and occupational mobility of pupil teachers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries | journal = [[History of Education Quarterly|History of Education]] | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 165\u2013186 | doi = 10.1080/0046760970260203 | date = 1997 | ref = harv }}</ref> The National Union of Women Teachers (NUWT) originated in the early 20th century inside the male-controlled National Union of Teachers (NUT).

One route to entry was to go to the United States where there were suitable schools for women as early as 1850.  Britain was the last major country to train women physicians, so 80 to 90% of the British women came to America for their medical degrees.  Edinburgh University admitted a few women in 1869, then reversed itself in 1873, leaving a strong negative reaction among British medical educators.  The first separate school for women physicians opened in London in 1874 to a handful of students. Scotland was more open.

It required a very expensive private act of Parliament costing perhaps \u00a3200, of the sort only the richest could possibly afford. It was very difficult to secure divorce on the grounds of adultery, desertion, or cruelty.  The first key legislative victory came with the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1857|Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857]]. It passed over the strenuous opposition of the highly traditional Church of England. The new law made divorce a civil affair of the courts, rather than a Church matter, with a new civil court in London handling all cases.  The process was still quite expensive, at about \u00a340, but now became feasible for the middle class. A woman who obtained a judicial separation took the status of a ''feme sole,'' with full control of her own civil rights.  Additional amendments came in 1878, which allowed for separations handled by local justices of the peace. The Church of England blocked further reforms until the final breakthrough came with the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]].<ref>{{cite book | editor-last = Stone | editor-first = Lawrence | title = Road to divorce: England 1530-1987 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780198226512 }}</ref><ref>{{citation | last = Hal\u00e9vy | first = \u00c9lie | title = A history of the English people | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}</ref>\n\n===Prostitution===\n{{main|Prostitution in the United Kingdom}}\nBullough argues that prostitution in 18th-century Britain was a convenience to men of all social statuses, and economic necessity for many poor women, and was tolerated by society.

Parliament in the 1860s in the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]] (\"CD\") adopted the French system of licensed prostitution. The \"regulationist policy\" was to isolate, segregate, and control prostitution. The main goal was to protect working men, soldiers and sailors near ports and army bases from catching venereal disease. Young women officially became prostitutes and were  trapped for life in the system. After a nationwide crusade led by [[Josephine Butler]] and the [[Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts]], Parliament repealed the acts in 1886 and ended legalised prostitution. Butler became a sort of saviour to the girls she helped free. The age of consent for young women was raised from 12 to 16, undercutting the supply of young prostitutes who were in highest demand. The new moral code meant that respectable men dared not be caught.<ref name=\"Hal\u00e9vy_498\">{{cite book | last = Hal\u00e9vy | first = \u00c9lie | title = A history of the English people | pages = 498\u2013500 | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1 = Strachey | first1 = Ray | last2 = Strachey | first2 = Barbara | title = The cause: a short history of the women's movement in Great Britain | pages = 187\u2013222 | publisher = Virago | location = London | year = 1978 | isbn = 9780860680420 | ref = harv }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Bartley | first = Paula | title = Prostitution: prevention and reform in England, 1860-1914 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780415214575 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Smith | first = F.B. | title = The Contagious Diseases Acts reconsidered | journal = Social History of Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 197\u2013215 | doi = 10.1093/shm/3.2.197 | pmid = 11622578 | date = August 1990 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\n===Protection for rich and poor women===\nA series of four laws each called the [[Married Women's Property Act (disambiguation)|Married Women's Property Act]] passed Parliament from [[Married Women's Property Act 1870|1870]] to [[Married Women's Property Act 1893|1893]] that effectively removed the restrictions that kept wealthy married women from controlling their own property.

The term became visible in distinctive green, purple, and white emblems, and the [[Artists' Suffrage League]]'s dramatic graphics.

[[Emily Davison]], a WSPU member, unexpectedly ran onto the track during the 1913 [[Epsom Derby]] and died under the King's horse. These tactics produced mixed results of sympathy and alienation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} As many protesters were imprisoned and [[Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913|went on hunger-strike]], the Liberal government was left with an embarrassing situation. From these political actions, the suffragists successfully created publicity around their institutional discrimination and sexism.  Historians generally argue that the first stage of the militant suffragette movement under the Pankhursts in 1906 had a dramatic mobilizing effect on the suffrage movement.  Women were thrilled and supportive of revolting in the streets; the membership of the militant WSPU and the older NUWSS overlapped and was mutually supportive.  However a system of publicity, Ensor argues, had to continue to escalate to maintain its high visibility in the media.  The hunger strikes and force-feeding did that.  However the Pankhursts refused any advice and escalated their tactics. They turned to systematic disruption of Liberal Party meetings as well as physical violence in terms of damaging public buildings and arson.  This went too far, as the overwhelming majority of suffragists pulled back and refused to follow because they could no longer defend the tactics.  Shey increasingly repudiated the suffragettes as an obstacle to achieving suffrage, saying the militant suffragettes  were now aiding the antis, and many historians agree.  Searle says the methods of the suffragettes did succeed in damaging the Liberal party but failed to advance the cause of woman suffrage.  When the Pankhursts decided to stop the militancy at the start of the war, and enthusiastically support the war effort, the movement split and their leadership role ended.  Suffrage did come four years later, but the feminist movement in Britain permanently abandoned the militant tactics that had made the suffragettes famous.<ref>{{cite book | last = Ensor | first = Robert C.K. | title = England: 1870-1914 | pages = 389\u2013399 | publisher = Clarendon Press | location = Oxford | oclc = 24731395 }}</ref><ref>{{citation | last = Searle | first = G.

Pugh (1974) argues that enfranchising soldiers primarily and women secondarily was decided by senior politicians in 1916. In the absence of major women's groups demanding for equal suffrage, the government's conference recommended limited, age-restricted women's suffrage. The [[suffragettes]] had been weakened, Pugh argues, by repeated failures before 1914 and by the disorganising effects of war mobilization; therefore they quietly accepted these restrictions, which were approved in 1918 by a majority of the War Ministry and each political party in Parliament.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Pugh | first = Martin D. | title = Politicians and the woman's vote 1914\u20131918 | journal = [[History (journal)|History]] | volume = 59 | issue = 197 | pages = 358\u2013374 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-229X.1974.tb02222.x | jstor = 24409414 | date = October 1974 | ref = harv }}</ref> More generally, Searle (2004) argues that the British debate was essentially over by the 1890s, and that granting the suffrage in 1918 was mostly a byproduct of giving the vote to male soldiers.

It also lobbied at an international level, such as the [[League of Nations]], and continued its work till 1983. In retrospect both ideological groups were influential in advancing women's rights in their own way. Despite women being admitted to the House of Commons from 1918, Mackworth, a Viscountess in her own right, spent a lifetime fighting to take her seat in the House of Lords against bitter opposition, a battle which only achieved its goal in the year of her death (1958). This revealed the weaknesses of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act. Mackworth also founded [[Time and Tide (magazine)|''Time and Tide'']] which became the group's journal, and to which West, Virginia Woolf, [[Rose Macaulay]] and many others contributed. A number of other women's periodicals also appeared in the 1920s, including ''Woman and Home'', and ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'', but whose content reflect very different aspirations. In 1925 Rebecca West wrote in ''Time and Tide'' something that reflected not only the movement's need to redefine itself post suffrage, but a continual need for re-examination of goals. \"When those of our army whose voices are inclined to coolly tell us that the day of sex-antagonism is over and henceforth we have only to advance hand in hand with the male, I do not believe it.\"<ref>Walters, Margaret (2005). \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=PCwdyaLCbXoC&pg=PT116 Early 20th-century feminism]\".

countries, '''feminism in the United Kingdom''' seeks to establish political, social, and economic equality for women. The history of feminism in Britain dates to the very beginnings of [[feminism]] itself, as many of the earliest feminist writers and activists\u2014such as [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], [[Barbara Bodichon]], and [[Lydia Becker]]\u2014were British.\n\n==19th century==\n{{main|History of women in the United Kingdom#19th century}}\n[[File:+Ann Thornton Going Aloft.jpg|thumb|160px|''[[Anne Jane Thornton|Ann Thornton]] Going Aloft'', ''c.'' 1835]]\nThe advent of the [[Reformism|reformist]] age during the 19th century meant that those invisible minorities or marginalised majorities were to find a catalyst and a microcosm in such new tendencies of reform. [[Robert Owen]], while asking for \"social reorganisation\", was laying down the basis of a new reformational background. One of those movements that took advantage of such new spirit was the [[feminist movement]]. The stereotype of the [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] gentle lady became unacceptable and even intolerable. The first organised movement for British women's suffrage was the [[Langham Place Circle]] of the 1850s, led by [[Barbara Bodichon]] (''n\u00e9e'' Leigh-Smith) and [[Bessie Rayner Parkes]]. They also campaigned for improved female rights in the law, employment, education, and marriage.\n\nProperty owning women and widows had been allowed to vote in some local elections, but that ended in 1835. The [[Chartist Movement]] of 1838 to 1857 was a large-scale demand for suffrage\u2014however it only gave suffrage to men over 21. In 1851 the [[Sheffield Female Political Association]] was founded and submitted an unsuccessful petition calling for women's suffrage to the House of Lords. This probably inspired British feminist [[Harriet Taylor Mill]] to write the pro-women's-suffrage ''[[The Enfranchisement of Women]]'' (1851).<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/taylor_harriet.shtml|title=BBC - History - Historic Figures: Harriet Taylor (1807 - 1858)}}</ref><ref name=\"Harriet Taylor Mill 1807 - 1858\">[http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/whm2003/ht_mill4.html Harriet Taylor Mill (1807 - 1858)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070414184944/http://www.pinn.net/~sunshine/whm2003/ht_mill4.html |date=2007-04-14 }}</ref><ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web|url=http://womhist.alexanderstreet.com/awrm/doc15.htm|title=Harriet Taylor Mill, Enfranchisement of Women, 1851|website=womhist.alexanderstreet.com}}</ref> On June 7, 1866 a petition from 1,499 women calling for women's suffrage was presented to the Parliament, but it also did not succeed.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsehistory/2016/06/07/the-1866-womens-suffrage-petition/ |title=The 1866 women's suffrage petition &#124; LSE History |publisher=Blogs.lse.ac.uk |date=2016-06-12 |accessdate=2018-02-07}}</ref>\n\nUpper-class women could exert a little backstage political influence in high society. However, in divorce cases, rich women lost control of their children.\n\n===Careers===\nAmbitious middle-class women faced enormous challenges when they proposed entering suitable careers, such as nursing, teaching, law, and medicine, and the loftier their ambition, the greater the challenge.

[[Florence Nightingale]] demonstrated the necessity of professional nursing and warfare, and set up an educational system that tracked women into that field in the second half of the nineteenth century.  Teaching was not quite as easy to break into, but the low salaries were less of the barrier to the single woman than to the married man.  By the late 1860s a number of schools were preparing women for careers as governesses or teachers. The census reported in 1851 that 70,000 women in England and Wales were teachers, compared to the 170,000 who comprised three-fourths of all teachers in 1901.<ref name=\"Hal\u00e9vy_500\">{{cite book | last = Hal\u00e9vy | first = \u00c9lie | title = A history of the English people | page = 500 | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Copelman | first = Dina | title = London's women teachers: gender, class and feminism, 1870-1930 | publisher = Routledge | location = London | year = 2014 | isbn = 9780415867528 }}</ref> The great majority came from lower middle class origins.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Coppock | first = David A. | title = Respectability as a prerequisite of moral character: the social and occupational mobility of pupil teachers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries | journal = [[History of Education Quarterly|History of Education]] | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 165\u2013186 | doi = 10.1080/0046760970260203 | date = 1997 | ref = harv }}</ref> The National Union of Women Teachers (NUWT) originated in the early 20th century inside the male-controlled National Union of Teachers (NUT).

One route to entry was to go to the United States where there were suitable schools for women as early as 1850.  Britain was the last major country to train women physicians, so 80 to 90% of the British women came to America for their medical degrees.  Edinburgh University admitted a few women in 1869, then reversed itself in 1873, leaving a strong negative reaction among British medical educators.  The first separate school for women physicians opened in London in 1874 to a handful of students. Scotland was more open.

It required a very expensive private act of Parliament costing perhaps \u00a3200, of the sort only the richest could possibly afford. It was very difficult to secure divorce on the grounds of adultery, desertion, or cruelty.  The first key legislative victory came with the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1857|Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857]]. It passed over the strenuous opposition of the highly traditional Church of England. The new law made divorce a civil affair of the courts, rather than a Church matter, with a new civil court in London handling all cases.  The process was still quite expensive, at about \u00a340, but now became feasible for the middle class. A woman who obtained a judicial separation took the status of a ''feme sole,'' with full control of her own civil rights.  Additional amendments came in 1878, which allowed for separations handled by local justices of the peace. The Church of England blocked further reforms until the final breakthrough came with the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1973]].<ref>{{cite book | editor-last = Stone | editor-first = Lawrence | title = Road to divorce: England 1530-1987 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780198226512 }}</ref><ref>{{citation | last = Hal\u00e9vy | first = \u00c9lie | title = A history of the English people | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}</ref>\n\n===Prostitution===\n{{main|Prostitution in the United Kingdom}}\nBullough argues that prostitution in 18th-century Britain was a convenience to men of all social statuses, and economic necessity for many poor women, and was tolerated by society.

Parliament in the 1860s in the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]] (\"CD\") adopted the French system of licensed prostitution. The \"regulationist policy\" was to isolate, segregate, and control prostitution. The main goal was to protect working men, soldiers and sailors near ports and army bases from catching venereal disease. Young women officially became prostitutes and were  trapped for life in the system. After a nationwide crusade led by [[Josephine Butler]] and the [[Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts]], Parliament repealed the acts in 1886 and ended legalised prostitution. Butler became a sort of saviour to the girls she helped free. The age of consent for young women was raised from 12 to 16, undercutting the supply of young prostitutes who were in highest demand. The new moral code meant that respectable men dared not be caught.<ref name=\"Hal\u00e9vy_498\">{{cite book | last = Hal\u00e9vy | first = \u00c9lie | title = A history of the English people | pages = 498\u2013500 | publisher = Ernest Benn | location = London | year = 1934 | oclc = 504342781 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last1 = Strachey | first1 = Ray | last2 = Strachey | first2 = Barbara | title = The cause: a short history of the women's movement in Great Britain | pages = 187\u2013222 | publisher = Virago | location = London | year = 1978 | isbn = 9780860680420 | ref = harv }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Bartley | first = Paula | title = Prostitution: prevention and reform in England, 1860-1914 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780415214575 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Smith | first = F.B. | title = The Contagious Diseases Acts reconsidered | journal = Social History of Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 197\u2013215 | doi = 10.1093/shm/3.2.197 | pmid = 11622578 | date = August 1990 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\n===Protection for rich and poor women===\nA series of four laws each called the [[Married Women's Property Act (disambiguation)|Married Women's Property Act]] passed Parliament from [[Married Women's Property Act 1870|1870]] to [[Married Women's Property Act 1893|1893]] that effectively removed the restrictions that kept wealthy married women from controlling their own property.

The term became visible in distinctive green, purple, and white emblems, and the [[Artists' Suffrage League]]'s dramatic graphics.

[[Emily Davison]], a WSPU member, unexpectedly ran onto the track during the 1913 [[Epsom Derby]] and died under the King's horse. These tactics produced mixed results of sympathy and alienation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} As many protesters were imprisoned and [[Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913|went on hunger-strike]], the Liberal government was left with an embarrassing situation. From these political actions, the suffragists successfully created publicity around their institutional discrimination and sexism.  Historians generally argue that the first stage of the militant suffragette movement under the Pankhursts in 1906 had a dramatic mobilizing effect on the suffrage movement.  Women were thrilled and supportive of revolting in the streets; the membership of the militant WSPU and the older NUWSS overlapped and was mutually supportive.  However a system of publicity, Ensor argues, had to continue to escalate to maintain its high visibility in the media.  The hunger strikes and force-feeding did that.  However the Pankhursts refused any advice and escalated their tactics. They turned to systematic disruption of Liberal Party meetings as well as physical violence in terms of damaging public buildings and arson.  This went too far, as the overwhelming majority of suffragists pulled back and refused to follow because they could no longer defend the tactics.  Shey increasingly repudiated the suffragettes as an obstacle to achieving suffrage, saying the militant suffragettes  were now aiding the antis, and many historians agree.  Searle says the methods of the suffragettes did succeed in damaging the Liberal party but failed to advance the cause of woman suffrage.  When the Pankhursts decided to stop the militancy at the start of the war, and enthusiastically support the war effort, the movement split and their leadership role ended.  Suffrage did come four years later, but the feminist movement in Britain permanently abandoned the militant tactics that had made the suffragettes famous.<ref>{{cite book | last = Ensor | first = Robert C.K. | title = England: 1870-1914 | pages = 389\u2013399 | publisher = Clarendon Press | location = Oxford | oclc = 24731395 }}</ref><ref>{{citation | last = Searle | first = G.

Pugh (1974) argues that enfranchising soldiers primarily and women secondarily was decided by senior politicians in 1916. In the absence of major women's groups demanding for equal suffrage, the government's conference recommended limited, age-restricted women's suffrage. The [[suffragettes]] had been weakened, Pugh argues, by repeated failures before 1914 and by the disorganising effects of war mobilization; therefore they quietly accepted these restrictions, which were approved in 1918 by a majority of the War Ministry and each political party in Parliament.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Pugh | first = Martin D. | title = Politicians and the woman's vote 1914\u20131918 | journal = [[History (journal)|History]] | volume = 59 | issue = 197 | pages = 358\u2013374 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-229X.1974.tb02222.x | jstor = 24409414 | date = October 1974 | ref = harv }}</ref> More generally, Searle (2004) argues that the British debate was essentially over by the 1890s, and that granting the suffrage in 1918 was mostly a byproduct of giving the vote to male soldiers.

As a political lobby group it aimed at political, occupational, moral, social, economic and legal equality. Thus it was ideologically allied with the Open Door Council, rather than National Council. It also lobbied at an international level, such as the [[League of Nations]], and continued its work till 1983. In retrospect both ideological groups were influential in advancing women's rights in their own way. Despite women being admitted to the House of Commons from 1918, Mackworth, a Viscountess in her own right, spent a lifetime fighting to take her seat in the House of Lords against bitter opposition, a battle which only achieved its goal in the year of her death (1958). This revealed the weaknesses of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act. Mackworth also founded [[Time and Tide (magazine)|''Time and Tide'']] which became the group's journal, and to which West, Virginia Woolf, [[Rose Macaulay]] and many others contributed. A number of other women's periodicals also appeared in the 1920s, including ''Woman and Home'', and ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'', but whose content reflect very different aspirations. In 1925 Rebecca West wrote in ''Time and Tide'' something that reflected not only the movement's need to redefine itself post suffrage, but a continual need for re-examination of goals. \"When those of our army whose voices are inclined to coolly tell us that the day of sex-antagonism is over and henceforth we have only to advance hand in hand with the male, I do not believe it.\"<ref>Walters, Margaret (2005). \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=PCwdyaLCbXoC&pg=PT116 Early 20th-century feminism]\".

{"title_page": "Psychology of religion", "text_new": "{{Psychology sidebar|applied}}\n\nStrictly speaking, '''psychology of religion''' consists of the application of [[List of psychological research methods|psychological methods]] and interpretive frameworks to the diverse contents of [[Religion|religious]] traditions as well as to both religious and [[Irreligion|irreligious]] individuals. The extraordinary range of methods and frameworks can be helpfully summed up regarding the classic distinction between the [[Natural science|natural-scientific]] and human-scientific approaches. The first cluster proceeds by means of objective, quantitative, and preferably experimental procedures for testing hypotheses regarding the causal connections among the objects of one's study. In contrast, the human-scientific approach accesses the human world of experience using qualitative, [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]], and interpretive methods, with the goal of discerning meaningful rather than causal connections among the phenomena one seeks to understand.\n\n[[Psychologist]]s of religion pursue three major projects: (1) systematic description, especially of religious contents, attitudes, experiences, and expressions; (2) explanation of the origins of religion, both in the history of the human race and in individual lives, taking into account a diversity of influences; and (3) mapping out the consequences of religious attitudes and conduct, both for the individual and for society at large. The [[psychology]] of religion first arose as a self-conscious discipline in the late 19th century, but all three of these tasks have a history going back many centuries before that.<ref name=\" Wulff, D. M. 2010 pp. 732\">Wulff, D. M. (2010). Psychology of Religion. In D. A. Leeming, K. Madden, & S. Marian (Eds.), ''Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion'' (pp. 732\u2013735). New York; London: Springer.</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nThe challenge for the psychology of religion is essentially threefold: (1) to provide a thoroughgoing description of the objects of investigation, whether they be shared religious content (e.g., a tradition's ritual observances) or individual experiences, attitudes, or conduct; (2) to account in psychological terms for the rise of such phenomena, whether they be in individual lives; and (3) to clarify the outcomes\u2014the fruits, as William James put it\u2014of these phenomena, for individuals, and the larger society.<ref name=\" Wulff, D. M. 2010 pp. 732\"/> These fruits may be both positive and negative.\n\nThe first, descriptive task naturally requires a clarification of one's terms\u2014above all, the word ''religion''. [[History of religion|Historians of religion]] have long underscored the problematic character of this term, noting that its usage over the centuries has changed in significant ways, generally in the direction of [[Reification (fallacy)|reification]].<ref>Smith, W. C. (1963). ''The Meaning and End of Religion: A New Approach to the Religious Traditions of Mankind.'' New York: Macmillan.</ref> The early psychologists of religion were fully aware of these difficulties, typically acknowledging that the definitions they were choosing to use were to some degree arbitrary.<ref>Wulff, D. M. (1999). Psychologists Define Religion: Patterns and Prospects of a Century-Long Quest. In J. G. Platvoet and A. L. Molendijk (Eds.), ''The Pragmatics of Defining Religion: Contexts, Concepts, and Contests'' (pp. 207\u2013224). Leiden: Brill</ref> With the rise of positivistic trends in psychology over the course of the 20th century, especially the demand that all phenomena be operationalized by quantitative procedures, psychologists of religion developed a multitude of scales, most of them developed for use with Protestant Christians.<ref>Hill, P. C., and Hood, R. W., Jr. (Eds.). (1999). ''Measures of Religiosity.\" Birmingham, AL: Religious Education Press.</ref> [[Factor analysis]] was also brought into play by both psychologists and [[Sociology of religion|sociologists of religion]], to establish a fixed core of dimensions and a corresponding set of scales. The justification and adequacy of these efforts, especially in the light of constructivist and other [[postmodern]] viewpoints, remains a matter of debate.\n\nIn the last several decades, especially among [[clinical psychologist]]s, a preference for the terms \"spirituality\" and \"spiritual\" has emerged, along with efforts to distinguish them from \"religion\" and \"religious.\" Especially in the [[United States]], \"religion\" has for many become associated with sectarian institutions and their obligatory creeds and rituals, thus giving the word a negative cast; \"[[spirituality]],\" in contrast, is positively constructed as deeply individual and subjective, as a universal capacity to apprehend and accord one's life with higher realities.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Schlehofer M.

Park (Eds.), ''Handbook of the Psychology of Religion and Spirituality.'' New York, London: Guilford Press.</ref>\n\nSchnitker and Emmons theorized that the understanding of religion as a search for meaning makes implications in the three psychological areas of motivation, cognition and social relationships. The cognitive aspects relate to God and a sense of purpose, the motivational ones to the need to control, and the religious search for meaning is also woven into social communities.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Spiritual striving and seeking the sacred: religion as meaningful goal-directed behavior.|last = Schnitker|first = Sarah|date = 2013|journal = The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion|doi = 10.1080/10508619.2013.795822|pmid = |volume=23|issue = 4|pages=315\u2013324}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{More footnotes|date=January 2012}}\n\n=== William James ===\nAmerican psychologist and philosopher [[William James]] (1842\u20131910) is regarded by most psychologists of religion as the founder of the field.<ref>Spilka, Hood, Hunsberger and Gorsuch, 2003, The Psychology of Religion, p. 24</ref> He served as president of the [[American Psychological Association]], and wrote one of the first psychology textbooks. In the psychology of religion, James' influence endures. His ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience|Varieties of Religious Experience]]'' is considered to be the classic work in the field, and references to James' ideas are common at professional conferences.\n\nJames distinguished between [[institutional religion]] and personal religion. Institutional religion refers to the religious group or organization and plays an important part in a society's culture. Personal religion, in which the individual has [[mystical experience]], can be experienced regardless of the culture. James was most interested in understanding personal religious experience.\n\nIn studying personal [[religious experience]]s, James made a distinction between ''healthy-minded'' and ''sick-souled'' religiousness. Individuals predisposed to healthy-mindedness tend to ignore the evil in the world and focus on the positive and the good. James used examples of [[Walt Whitman]] and the \"[[mind-cure]]\" religious movement to illustrate healthy-mindedness in ''The Varieties of Religious Experience''. In contrast, individuals predisposed to having a sick-souled religion are unable to ignore evil and suffering and need a unifying experience, religious or otherwise, to reconcile good and evil. James included quotations from [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[John Bunyan]] to illustrate the sick soul.\n\nWilliam James' hypothesis of [[pragmatism]] stems from the efficacy of religion. If an individual believes in and performs religious activities, and those actions happen to work, then that practice appears the proper choice for the individual. However, if the processes of religion have little efficacy, then there is no rationality for continuing the practice.\n\n=== Other early theorists ===\n\n==== G. W. F. Hegel ====\n[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770\u20131831) described all systems of religion, philosophy, and social science as expressions of the basic urge of consciousness to learn about itself and its surroundings, and record its findings and hypotheses. Thus, religion is only a form of that search for knowledge, within which humans record various experiences and reflections. Others, compiling and categorizing these writings in various ways, form the consolidated worldview as articulated by that religion, philosophy, social science, etc. His work [[The Phenomenology of Spirit]] was a study of how various types of writing and thinking draw from and re-combine with the individual and group experiences of various places and times, influencing the current forms of knowledge and worldviews that are operative in a population. This activity is the functioning of an incomplete group mind, where each is accessing the recorded wisdom of others. His works often include detailed descriptions of the psychological motivations involved in thought and behavior, e.g., the struggle of a community or nation to know itself and thus correctly govern itself. In Hegel's system, Religion is one of the major repositories of wisdom to be used in these struggles, representing a huge body of recollections from humanity's past in various stages of its development.\n\n==== Sigmund Freud ====\n[[File:Hall Freud Jung in front of Clark 1909.jpg|thumb|290px|right|Group photo 1909 in front of [[Clark University]]. Front row: [[Sigmund Freud]], [[G. Stanley Hall]], [[Carl Jung]]. Back row: [[Abraham Brill]], [[Ernest Jones]], [[S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi]].]] \n[[Sigmund Freud]] (1856\u20131939) gave explanations of the genesis of religion in his various writings. In ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'', he applied the idea of the [[Oedipus complex]] (involving unresolved sexual feelings of, for example, a son toward his mother and hostility toward his father) and postulated its emergence in the primordial stage of human development.\n\nIn ''[[Moses and Monotheism]]'', Freud reconstructed biblical history by his general theory. His ideas were also developed in ''[[The Future of an Illusion]]''. When Freud spoke of religion as an [[illusion]], he maintained that it \"is a fantasy structure from which a man must be set free if he is to grow to maturity.\"\n\nFreud views the idea of [[God]] as being a version of the [[father]] image, and religious belief as at bottom infantile and [[neurosis|neurotic]]. Authoritarian religion, Freud believed, is dysfunctional and alienates man from himself.\n\n==== Carl Jung ====\nThe Swiss psychoanalyst [[Carl Jung]] (1875\u20131961) adopted a very different posture, one that was more sympathetic to religion and more concerned with a positive appreciation of [[religious symbolism]]. Jung considered the question of the metaphysical existence of God to be unanswerable by the psychologist and adopted a kind of [[agnosticism]].<ref>Jung, 'On the Nature of the Psyche,' C.W.8, Aphorisms 362, 420.</ref>\n\nJung postulated, in addition to the personal [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] (roughly adopting Freud's concept), the [[collective unconscious]], which is the repository of human experience and which contains \"[[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]]\" (i.e. basic images that are universal in that they recur regardless of culture). The irruption of these images from the unconscious into the realm of consciousness he viewed as the basis of [[religious experience]] and often of artistic creativity. Some of Jung's writings have been devoted to elucidating some of the archetypal [[symbol]]s, and include his work in [[comparative mythology]].\n\n==== Alfred Adler ====\nAustrian psychiatrist [[Alfred Adler]] (1870\u20131937), who parted ways with Freud, emphasized the role of goals and motivation in his ''Individual Psychology''. One of Adler's most famous ideas is that we try to compensate for inferiorities that we perceive in ourselves. A lack of power often lies at the root of feelings of inferiority. One way that religion enters into this picture is through our beliefs in God, which are characteristic of our tendency to strive for perfection and superiority. For example, in many religions, God is considered to be perfect and omnipotent, and commands people likewise to be perfect. If we, too, achieve perfection, we become one with God. By identifying with God in this way, we compensate for our imperfections and feelings of inferiority.\n\nOur ideas about [[God]] are important indicators of how we view the world. According to Adler, these ideas have changed over time, as our vision of the world \u2013 and our place in it \u2013 has changed. Consider this example that Adler offers: the traditional belief that people were placed deliberately on earth as God's ultimate creation is being replaced with the idea that people have evolved by [[natural selection]]. This coincides with a view of God not as a real being, but as an abstract representation of nature's forces. In this way, our view of God has changed from one that was concrete and specific to one that is more general. From Adler's vantage point, this is a relatively ineffective perception of God because it is so general that it fails to convey a strong sense of direction and purpose.\n\nAn important thing for Adler is that God (or the idea of God) motivates people to act and that those actions do have real consequences for ourselves and others. Our view of God is important because it embodies our goals and directs our social interactions.\n\nCompared to [[science]], another social movement, [[religion]] is more efficient because it motivates people more effectively. According to Adler, only when science begins to capture the same religious fervor, and promotes the welfare of all segments of society, will the two be more equal in peoples' eyes.\n\n==== Gordon Allport ====\nIn his classic book ''The Individual and His Religion'' (1950), [[Gordon Allport]] (1897\u20131967) illustrates how people may use religion in different ways.<ref name=\"Leak\">{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3852/is_200201/ai_n9029025/?tag=untagged|title=Exploratory factor analysis of the religious maturity scale|last=Leak|first=Gary K|year=2002|work=BNET UK|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc|accessdate=22 March 2010}}</ref> He makes a distinction between ''Mature religion'' and\n''Immature religion''. Mature religious sentiment is how Allport characterized the person whose approach to religion is dynamic, open-minded, and able to maintain links between inconsistencies. In contrast, immature religion is [[vanity|self-serving]] and generally represents the negative stereotypes that people have about religion.\nMore recently, this distinction has been encapsulated in the terms \"intrinsic religion\", referring to a genuine, heartfelt devout [[faith]], and \"extrinsic religion\", referring to a more utilitarian use of religion as a means to an end, such as [[church attendance]] to gain [[social status]]. These dimensions of religion were measured on the [[Extrinsic religious orientation|Religious Orientation Scale]] of Allport and Ross (1967). The third form of religious orientation has been described by [[Daniel Batson]]. This refers to treatment of religion as an open-ended search (Batson, Schoenrade & Ventis, 1993).\nMore specifically, it has been seen by Batson as comprising a willingness to view religious doubts positively, acceptance that religious orientation can change and existential complexity, the belief that one's religious beliefs should be shaped from personal crises that one has experienced in one's life. Batson refers to extrinsic, intrinsic and quests respectively as religion-as-means, religion-as-end, and religion-as-quest, and measures these constructs on the Religious Life Inventory (Batson, Schoenrade & Ventis, 1993).\n\n==== Erik H. Erikson ====\n[[Erik Erikson]] (1902\u20131994) is best known for his theory of psychological development, which has its roots in the psychoanalytic importance of [[identity (social science)|identity]] in personality. His biographies of [[Gandhi]] and [[Martin Luther]] reveal Erikson's positive view of religion. He considered religions to be important influences in successful [[personality development]] because they are the primary way that cultures promote the [[virtues]] associated with each stage of life. Religious [[ritual]]s facilitate this development. Erikson's theory has not benefited from systematic empirical study, but it remains an influential and well-regarded theory in the psychological study of religion.\n\n==== Erich Fromm ====\nThe American scholar [[Erich Fromm]] (1900\u20131980) modified the Freudian theory and produced a more complex account of the functions of religion. In his book ''[[Psychoanalysis and Religion]]'' he responded to Freud's theories by explaining that part of the modification is viewing the [[Oedipus complex]] as based not so much on sexuality as on a \"much more profound desire\", namely, the childish desire to remain attached to protecting figures. The right religion, in Fromm's estimation, can, in principle, foster an individual's highest potentialities, but religion in practice tends to relapse into being neurotic.<ref name=PsyRel>{{cite book |last1=Fromm |first1=Erich |authorlink1=Erich Fromm |title=Psychoanalysis and Religion |url=https://archive.org/details/psychoanalysisre00fromrich |url-access=registration |quote=psychoanalysis and religion. |accessdate=10 February 2010 |year=1950 |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |location=New Haven, CT, US |isbn=978-0-300-00089-4 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to Fromm, humans need a stable frame of reference. Religion fills this need. In effect, humans crave answers to questions that no other source of knowledge has an answer to, which only religion may seem to answer. However, a sense of free will must be given for religion to appear healthy. An authoritarian notion of religion appears detrimental.<ref name=Personality>{{cite book |title=Personality |last=Burger |first=Jerry |year=2007 |publisher=[[Cengage Learning]] |location=Stamford, CT, US |isbn=978-0-495-09786-0 |pages=122\u2013123 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FvGH0J_wHggC&dq=Fromm+Freud+Jung+religion |accessdate=10 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n==== Rudolf Otto ====\n[[Rudolf Otto]] (1869\u20131937) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Protestant]] theologian and scholar of [[comparative religion]]. Otto's most famous work, ''The Idea of the Holy'' (published first in 1917 as ''Das Heilige''), defines the concept of the holy as that which is ''[[numinous]]''. Otto explained the numinous as a \"non-rational, non-sensory experience or feeling whose primary and immediate object is outside the self.\" It is a mystery (Latin: ''mysterium tremendum'') that is both fascinating (''fascinans'') and terrifying at the same time; A mystery that causes trembling and fascination, attempting to explain that inexpressible and perhaps supernatural emotional reaction of [[Sense of wonder|wonder]] drawing us to seemingly ordinary and/or religious experiences of [[divine grace|grace]]. This sense of emotional wonder appears evident at the root of all religious experiences. Through this emotional wonder, we suspend our rational mind for non-rational possibilities.\n\n''The Idea of the Holy'' also set out a [[paradigm]] for the study of religion that focuses on the need to realize the religious as a non-reducible, original category in its own right. This paradigm was under much attack between approximately 1950 and 1990 but has made a strong comeback since then.\n\n=== Modern thinkers ===\nAutobiographal accounts of 20th-century psychology of religion as a field have been supplied by numerous modern psychologists of religion, primarily based in Europe, but also by several US-based psychologists such as [[Ralph W. Hood]] and [[Donald Eric Capps|Donald Capps]].<ref name=belzen2012>{{cite book|editor1-last=Belzen|editor1-first=Jacob A. |title=Psychology of religion: autobiographical accounts|date=2012 |publisher=Springer |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4614-1601-2 |oclc=773924284}}</ref>\n\n==== Allen Bergin ====\n[[Allen Bergin]] is noted for his 1980 paper \"Psychotherapy and Religious Values,\" which is known as a landmark in scholarly acceptance that religious values do, in practice, influence psychotherapy.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Bergin A.

Jaynes hypothesized that hallucinated verbal commands helped non-conscious early man to perform tasks promoting human survival. Starting about 10,000 BCE, selective pressures favored the hallucinated verbal commands for social control, and they came to be perceived as an external, rather than internal, voice commanding the person to take some action. These were hence often explained as originating from invisible gods, spirits, ancestors, etc.<ref>{{Cite book| last=Jaynes | first=Julian | title=The origin of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind | publisher=Houghton Mifflin | year=2000 | isbn=978-0-618-05707-8 | pages=131\u2013143}}</ref>\n\n== Hypotheses on the role of religion ==\nThere are three primary hypotheses on the role of religion in the modern world.\n\n=== Secularization ===\nThe first hypothesis, [[secularization]], holds that science and technology will take the place of religion.<ref>{{cite book\n| author = Gill, R.\n| chapter = The future of religious participation and belief in Britain and beyond\n| editor = R.

In this study, researchers suggest that when a person's personal control is lessened, their motivation to believe in order is threatened, resulting in compensation of this threat through adherence to other external sources of control.\n\n== Psychometric approaches to religion ==\nSince the 1960s psychologists of religion have used the methodology of [[psychometrics]] to assess ways in which a person may be religious. An example is the [[Religious Orientation Scale]] of Allport and [[Michael Ross (psychologist)|Ross]],<ref>{{Cite journal\n | author = Allport, G.W. & [[Michael Ross (psychologist)|J.

The second measures three forms of religious orientation: religion as means (intrinsic), religion as end (extrinsic), and religion as quest. The third assesses spiritual maturity using two factors: Spiritual Support and Spiritual Openness.\n\n===Religious orientations and religious dimensions===\n{{Further|Sociology of religion}}\nSome questionnaires, such as the [[Religious Orientation Scale]], relate to different religious orientations, such as intrinsic and extrinsic religiousness, referring to different motivations for religious allegiance. A rather different approach, taken, for example, by Glock and Stark (1965), has been to list different dimensions of religion rather than different religious orientations, which relates to how an individual may manifest different forms of being religious. Glock and Stark's famous typology described five dimensions of religion \u2013 the doctrinal, the intellectual, the ethical-consequential, the ritual, and the experiential. In later work these authors subdivided the ritual dimension into devotional and public ritual, and also clarified that their distinction of religion along multiple dimensions was not identical to distinguishing religious orientations. Although some psychologists of religion have found it helpful to take a multidimensional approach to religion for the purpose of psychometric scale design, there has been, as Wulff (1997) explains, considerable controversy about whether religion should really be seen as multidimensional.\n\n===Questionnaires to assess religious experience===\nWhat we call religious experiences can differ greatly. Some reports exist of supernatural happenings that it would be difficult to explain from a rational, scientific point of view. On the other hand, there also exist the sort of testimonies that simply seem to convey a feeling of peace or oneness \u2013 something which most of us, religious or not, may possibly relate to. In categorizing religious experiences it is perhaps helpful to look at them as explicable through one of two theories: the Objectivist thesis or the Subjectivist thesis.\n\nAn objectivist would argue that the religious experience is a proof of God's existence. However, others have criticised the reliability of religious experiences. The English philosopher Thomas Hobbes asked how it was possible to tell the difference between talking to God in a dream, and dreaming about talking to God.<ref>{{cite book\n| author = Southwell, G.\n| chapter = Objectivist\n| title = Philosophy of Religion\n| publisher = UK\n| chapter-url =  http://www.philosophyonline.co.uk/pages/relex_main.htm#\n| accessdate = 26 April 2010\n}}</ref>\n\nThe Subjectivist view argues that it is not necessary to think of religious experiences as evidence for the existence of an actual being whom we call God. From this point of view, the important thing is the experience itself and the effect that it has on the individual.<ref>{{cite book\n| author = Southwell, G.\n| chapter = Subjectivist\n| title = Philosophy of Religion\n| publisher = UK\n| chapter-url =  http://www.philosophyonline.co.uk/pages/relex_main.htm#\n| accessdate = 26 April 2010\n}}</ref>\n\n== Developmental approaches to religion ==\n{{Main|James W. Fowler|Stages of faith development}}\n{{further|Psychology of religious conversion}}\n\nMany have looked at stage models, like those of [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Lawrence Kohlberg]], to explain how children develop ideas about God and religion in general.\n\nThe best known stage model of spiritual or religious development is that of [[James W. Fowler]], a [[developmental psychology|developmental psychologist]] at the [[Candler School of Theology]], in his ''Stages of Faith''.<ref>{{Cite book|isbn = 978-0-06-062866-6|title = Stages of Faith: The Psychology of Human Development|last1 = Fowler|first1 = James W.|date = 1995-09-15|url = https://archive.org/details/stagesoffaithpsy00fowl_0}}</ref> He follows Piaget and Kohlberg and has proposed a holistic staged development of [[faith]] (or spiritual development) across the lifespan.\n\nThe book-length study contains a framework and ideas which have generated a good deal of response from those interested in religion{{Who|date=July 2011}}, so it appears to have [[face validity]]. James Fowler proposes six stages of faith development:\n# Intuitive-projective\n# Symbolic Literal\n# Synthetic Conventional\n# Individuating\n# Paradoxical (conjunctive)\n# Universalising.\n\nAlthough there is evidence that children up to the age of twelve years do tend to be in the first two of these stages{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}, adults over the age of sixty-one show considerable variation in displays of qualities of Stages 3 and beyond{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}, most adults remaining in Stage 3 (Synthetic Conventional). Fowler's model has generated some empirical studies, and fuller descriptions of this research (and of these six stages) can be found in Wulff (1991).\n\nFowler's [[Scientific method|scientific research]] has been criticized for methodological weaknesses. Of Fowler's six stages, only the first two found empirical support{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}, and these were heavily based upon Piaget's stages of [[Theory of cognitive development|cognitive development]]. The tables and graphs in the book were presented in such a way that the last four stages appeared to be validated, but the requirements of [[Statistical#Statistical methods|statistical verification]] of the stages were not met. His study was not published in a journal, so was not peer-reviewed. Other critics{{Who|date=July 2011}} of Fowler have questioned whether his ordering of the stages really reflects his own commitment to a rather liberal Christian Protestant outlook, as if to say that people who adopt a similar viewpoint to Fowler are at higher stages of faith development. Nevertheless, the concepts Fowler introduced seemed to hit home with those in the circles of [[Religious studies|academic religion]]{{Who|date=July 2011}}, and have been an important starting point for various theories and subsequent studies{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}.\n\nOther theorists in developmental psychology have suggested that religiosity comes naturally to young children. Specifically, children may have a natural-born conception of mind-body dualism, which lends itself to beliefs that the mind may live on after the body dies. In addition, children have a tendency to see agency and human design where there is not, and prefer a creationist explanation of the world even when raised by parents who do not.<ref>{{Cite journal\n | author=Bloom, P. |date=January 2007\n | title=Religion is natural\n | journal = Developmental Science |volume= 10\n | issue= 1 |pages=147\u2013151\n | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2007.00577.x\n|pmid=17181713\n |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2ee6648647185af711ed07441995af7bc7c11fe0\n }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal\n | doi = 10.1006/cogp.2001.0749 | pmid=11305883 | volume=42 | issue=3 | title=Cognitive and contextual factors in the emergence of diverse belief systems: creation versus evolution. |date=May 2001  | journal=Cogn Psychol | pages=217\u201366 | first=E | last=Evans\n| citeseerx=10.1.1.370.1532 }}</ref>\n\nResearchers have also investigated attachment system dynamics as a predictor of the religious conversion experience throughout childhood and adolescence.

Under the correspondence hypothesis, internal working models of a person's attachment figure is thought to perpetuate his or her perception of God as a secure base. Another hypothesis relating attachment style to the conversion experience is the compensation hypothesis,<ref>{{Cite journal\n | author = Kirkpatrick, L.A., Shaver, P.R.\n | title = Attachment theory and religion: Childhood attachments, religious beliefs, and conversion\n | journal = [[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]\n | year = 1990\n | pages = 315\u2013334\n | doi=10.2307/1386461\n | volume=29| issue = 3\n | jstor = 1386461\n }}</ref> which states that individuals with insecure attachments are more likely to have a sudden conversion experience as they compensate for their insecure attachment relationship by seeking a relationship with God. \nResearchers have tested these hypotheses using longitudinal studies and individuals' self narratives of their conversation experience. For example, one study investigating attachment styles and adolescent conversions at Young Life religious summer camps resulted in evidence supporting the correspondence hypothesis through analysis of personal narratives and a prospective longitudinal follow-up of Young Life campers, with mixed results for the compensation hypothesis.<ref>{{Cite journal\n | title=Attachment Predicts Adolescent Conversions at Young Life\n | author=Sarah A.

Does that count, or should there be more references within the section itself?-->\n[[Evolutionary psychology]] is based on the hypothesis that, just like the cardiac, pulmonary, urinary, and immune systems, [[cognition]] has a functional structure with a genetic basis, and therefore appeared through [[natural selection]]. Like other organs and tissues, this functional structure should be universally shared among humans and should solve important problems of survival and reproduction. Evolutionary psychologists seek to understand cognitive processes by understanding the survival and reproductive functions they might serve.\n\n[[Pascal Boyer]] is one of the leading figures in the cognitive psychology of religion, a new field of inquiry that is less than fifteen years old, which accounts for the psychological processes that underlie religious thought and practice. In his book ''Religion Explained'', Boyer shows that there is no simple explanation for religious [[consciousness]]. Boyer is mainly concerned with explaining the various psychological processes involved in the acquisition and transmission of ideas concerning the gods. Boyer builds on the ideas of cognitive anthropologists [[Dan Sperber]] and [[Scott Atran]], who first argued that religious cognition represents a by-product of various evolutionary adaptations, including folk psychology, and purposeful violations of innate expectations about how the world is constructed (for example, bodiless beings with thoughts and emotions) that make religious cognitions striking and memorable.\n\nReligious persons acquire religious ideas and practices through social exposure. The child of a [[Zen]] [[Buddhist]] will not become an evangelical [[Christians|Christian]] or a [[Zulu people|Zulu]] warrior without the relevant cultural experience. While mere exposure does not cause a particular religious outlook (a person may have been raised a [[Roman Catholic]] but leave the church), nevertheless some exposure seems required \u2013 this person will never invent Roman Catholicism out of thin air. Boyer says [[cognitive science]] can help us to understand the psychological mechanisms that account for these manifest correlations and in so doing enable us to better understand the nature of religious belief and practice.\n\nBoyer moves outside the leading currents in mainstream [[cognitive psychology]] and suggests that we can use evolutionary biology to unravel the relevant mental architecture. Our brains are, after all, biological objects, and the best naturalistic account of their development in nature is Darwin's [[theory of evolution]]. To the extent that mental architecture exhibits intricate processes and structures, it is plausible to think that this is the result of evolutionary processes working over vast periods of time. Like all biological systems, the mind is optimised to promote survival and reproduction in the evolutionary environment. On this view all specialised cognitive functions broadly serve those [[reproductive]] ends.\n\nFor [[Steven Pinker]] the universal propensity toward religious belief is a genuine scientific puzzle. He thinks that [[adaptationist]] explanations for religion do not meet the criteria for adaptations. An alternative explanation is that religious psychology is a by-product of many parts of the mind that originally evolved for other purposes.\n\n== Religion and prayer ==\nReligious practice oftentimes manifests itself in some form of [[prayer]]. Recent studies have focused specifically on the effects of prayer on health. Measures of prayer and the above measures of spirituality evaluate different characteristics and should not be considered synonymous.\n\n[[Prayer]] is fairly prevalent in the United States.

This study appears to support the contemporary model of prayer as connection (whether to the self, higher being, or others).\n\nDein and Littlewood (2008) suggest that an individual's prayer life can be viewed on a spectrum ranging from immature to mature. A progression on the scale is characterized by a change in the perspective of the purpose of prayer. Rather than using prayer as a means of changing the reality of a situation, a more mature individual will use prayer to request assistance in coping with immutable problems and draw closer to God or others. This change in perspective has been shown to be associated with an individual's passage through adolescence.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Dein Simon, Littlewood Roland | year = 2008 | title = The Psychology of Prayer and the Development of the Prayer Experience Questionnaire | url = | journal = Mental Health, Religion & Culture | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 39\u201352 | doi=10.1080/13674670701384396}}</ref>\n\nPrayer appears to have health implications.

Shamans all over the world and in different cultures have traditionally used drugs, especially psychedelics, for their religious experiences. In these communities the absorption of [[Psychoactive drug|drugs]] leads to dreams (visions) through sensory distortion.\n\n[[William James]] was also interested in mystical experiences from a drug-induced perspective, leading him to make some experiments with [[nitrous oxide]] and even peyote.

Pastoral psychology is also concerned with improving the practice of [[chaplain]]s in [[healthcare]] and in the [[military]]. One major concern of pastoral psychology is to improve the practice of [[pastoral counseling]]. Pastoral psychology is a topic of interest for professional journals such as ''[[Pastoral Psychology (journal)|Pastoral Psychology]]'', the ''[[Journal of Psychology and Christianity]]'', and the ''[[Journal of Psychology and Theology]]''. In 1984, [[Thomas C. Oden|Thomas Oden]] severely criticized mid-20th-century [[pastoral care]] and the pastoral psychology that guided it as having entirely abandoned its classical/traditional sources, and having become overwhelmingly dominated by modern psychological influences from [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Carl Rogers|Rogers]], and others.<ref name=oden84>{{cite book\n |title       = Care of souls in the classic tradition\n |last        = Oden\n |first       = Thomas C.\n |authorlink  = Thomas C.

In Tables 1 through 3, he demonstrated that in pastoral care textbooks, citations to psychologists (such as [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Carl Jung|Jung]], and [[Carl Rogers|Rogers]]) had entirely replaced citations to traditional pastoral care thinkers (such as [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Gregory the Great]], and [[John Chrysostom|Chrysostom]]) between the late 19th century and the mid-20th century.</ref> More recently, others have described pastoral psychology as a field that experiences a tension between psychology and [[theology]].<ref>{{cite journal\n |author=Ermanno Pavesi\n |year=2010\n |title=Pastoral psychology as a field of tension between theology and psychology\n |journal=Christian Bioethics\n |volume=16\n |issue=1\n |pages=9\u201329\n |doi= 10.1093/cb/cbq001\n |issn=1744-4195}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Attachment theory and psychology of religion]]\n* [[Fear of God]]\n* ''[[Issues in Science and Religion]]''\n* [[Magical thinking]]\n* [[Mythopoeic thought]]\n* [[Philosophy of religion]]\n* [[:Category:Psychology of religion journals|Psychology of religion journals]]\n** ''[[International Journal for the Psychology of Religion]]''\n* [[Religious paranoia]]\n* [[Science and religion]]\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Adler, A., & Jahn, E., ''Religion and Psychology'', Frankfurt, 1933.\n* Allport, G.W. & Ross, J.M., ''Personal Religious Orientation and Prejudice'', Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 1967.\n* Allport, G.

The extraordinary range of methods and frameworks can be helpfully summed up regarding the classic distinction between the [[Natural science|natural-scientific]] and human-scientific approaches. The first cluster proceeds by means of objective, quantitative, and preferably experimental procedures for testing hypotheses regarding the causal connections among the objects of one's study. In contrast, the human-scientific approach accesses the human world of experience using qualitative, [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]], and interpretive methods, with the goal of discerning meaningful rather than causal connections among the phenomena one seeks to understand.\n\n[[Psychologist]]s of religion pursue three major projects: (1) systematic description, especially of religious contents, attitudes, experiences, and expressions; (2) explanation of the origins of religion, both in the history of the human race and in individual lives, taking into account a diversity of influences; and (3) mapping out the consequences of religious attitudes and conduct, both for the individual and for society at large. The [[psychology]] of religion first arose as a self-conscious discipline in the late 19th century, but all three of these tasks have a history going back many centuries before that.<ref name=\" Wulff, D. M. 2010 pp. 732\">Wulff, D. M. (2010). Psychology of Religion. In D. A. Leeming, K. Madden, & S. Marian (Eds.), ''Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion'' (pp. 732\u2013735). New York; London: Springer.</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nThe challenge for the psychology of religion is essentially threefold: (1) to provide a thoroughgoing description of the objects of investigation, whether they be shared religious content (e.g., a tradition's ritual observances) or individual experiences, attitudes, or conduct; (2) to account in psychological terms for the rise of such phenomena, whether they be in individual lives; and (3) to clarify the outcomes\u2014the fruits, as William James put it\u2014of these phenomena, for individuals, and the larger society.<ref name=\" Wulff, D. M. 2010 pp. 732\"/> These fruits may be both positive and negative.\n\nThe first, descriptive task naturally requires a clarification of one's terms\u2014above all, the word ''religion''. [[History of religion|Historians of religion]] have long underscored the problematic character of this term, noting that its usage over the centuries has changed in significant ways, generally in the direction of [[Reification (fallacy)|reification]].<ref>Smith, W. C. (1963). ''The Meaning and End of Religion: A New Approach to the Religious Traditions of Mankind.'' New York: Macmillan.</ref> The early psychologists of religion were fully aware of these difficulties, typically acknowledging that the definitions they were choosing to use were to some degree arbitrary.<ref>Wulff, D. M. (1999). Psychologists Define Religion: Patterns and Prospects of a Century-Long Quest. In J. G. Platvoet and A. L. Molendijk (Eds.), ''The Pragmatics of Defining Religion: Contexts, Concepts, and Contests'' (pp. 207\u2013224). Leiden: Brill</ref> With the rise of positivistic trends in psychology over the course of the 20th century, especially the demand that all phenomena be operationalized by quantitative procedures, psychologists of religion developed a multitude of scales, most of them developed for use with Protestant Christians.<ref>Hill, P. C., and Hood, R. W., Jr. (Eds.). (1999). ''Measures of Religiosity.\" Birmingham, AL: Religious Education Press.</ref> [[Factor analysis]] was also brought into play by both psychologists and [[Sociology of religion|sociologists of religion]], to establish a fixed core of dimensions and a corresponding set of scales. The justification and adequacy of these efforts, especially in the light of constructivist and other [[postmodern]] viewpoints, remains a matter of debate.\n\nIn the last several decades, especially among [[clinical psychologist]]s, a preference for the terms \"spirituality\" and \"spiritual\" has emerged, along with efforts to distinguish them from \"religion\" and \"religious.\" Especially in the [[United States]], \"religion\" has for many become associated with sectarian institutions and their obligatory creeds and rituals, thus giving the word a negative cast; \"[[spirituality]],\" in contrast, is positively constructed as deeply individual and subjective, as a universal capacity to apprehend and accord one's life with higher realities.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Schlehofer M.

The cognitive aspects relate to God and a sense of purpose, the motivational ones to the need to control, and the religious search for meaning is also woven into social communities.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Spiritual striving and seeking the sacred: religion as meaningful goal-directed behavior.|last = Schnitker|first = Sarah|date = 2013|journal = The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion|doi = 10.1080/10508619.2013.795822|pmid = |volume=23|issue = 4|pages=315\u2013324}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{More footnotes|date=January 2012}}\n\n=== William James ===\nAmerican psychologist and philosopher [[William James]] (1842\u20131910) is regarded by most psychologists of religion as the founder of the field.<ref>Spilka, Hood, Hunsberger and Gorsuch, 2003, The Psychology of Religion, p. 24</ref> He served as president of the [[American Psychological Association]], and wrote one of the first psychology textbooks. In the psychology of religion, James' influence endures. His ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience|Varieties of Religious Experience]]'' is considered to be the classic work in the field, and references to James' ideas are common at professional conferences.\n\nJames distinguished between [[institutional religion]] and personal religion. Institutional religion refers to the religious group or organization and plays an important part in a society's culture. Personal religion, in which the individual has [[mystical experience]], can be experienced regardless of the culture. James was most interested in understanding personal religious experience.\n\nIn studying personal [[religious experience]]s, James made a distinction between ''healthy-minded'' and ''sick-souled'' religiousness. Individuals predisposed to healthy-mindedness tend to ignore the evil in the world and focus on the positive and the good. James used examples of [[Walt Whitman]] and the \"[[mind-cure]]\" religious movement to illustrate healthy-mindedness in ''The Varieties of Religious Experience''. In contrast, individuals predisposed to having a sick-souled religion are unable to ignore evil and suffering and need a unifying experience, religious or otherwise, to reconcile good and evil. James included quotations from [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[John Bunyan]] to illustrate the sick soul.\n\nWilliam James' hypothesis of [[pragmatism]] stems from the efficacy of religion. If an individual believes in and performs religious activities, and those actions happen to work, then that practice appears the proper choice for the individual. However, if the processes of religion have little efficacy, then there is no rationality for continuing the practice.\n\n=== Other early theorists ===\n\n==== G. W. F. Hegel ====\n[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770\u20131831) described all systems of religion, philosophy, and social science as expressions of the basic urge of consciousness to learn about itself and its surroundings, and record its findings and hypotheses. Thus, religion is only a form of that search for knowledge, within which humans record various experiences and reflections. Others, compiling and categorizing these writings in various ways, form the consolidated worldview as articulated by that religion, philosophy, social science, etc. His work [[The Phenomenology of Spirit]] was a study of how various types of writing and thinking draw from and re-combine with the individual and group experiences of various places and times, influencing the current forms of knowledge and worldviews that are operative in a population. This activity is the functioning of an incomplete group mind, where each is accessing the recorded wisdom of others. His works often include detailed descriptions of the psychological motivations involved in thought and behavior, e.g., the struggle of a community or nation to know itself and thus correctly govern itself. In Hegel's system, Religion is one of the major repositories of wisdom to be used in these struggles, representing a huge body of recollections from humanity's past in various stages of its development.\n\n==== Sigmund Freud ====\n[[File:Hall Freud Jung in front of Clark 1909.jpg|thumb|290px|right|Group photo 1909 in front of [[Clark University]]. Front row: [[Sigmund Freud]], [[G. Stanley Hall]], [[Carl Jung]]. Back row: [[Abraham Brill]], [[Ernest Jones]], [[S\u00e1ndor Ferenczi]].]] \n[[Sigmund Freud]] (1856\u20131939) gave explanations of the genesis of religion in his various writings. In ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'', he applied the idea of the [[Oedipus complex]] (involving unresolved sexual feelings of, for example, a son toward his mother and hostility toward his father) and postulated its emergence in the primordial stage of human development.\n\nIn ''[[Moses and Monotheism]]'', Freud reconstructed biblical history by his general theory. His ideas were also developed in ''[[The Future of an Illusion]]''. When Freud spoke of religion as an [[illusion]], he maintained that it \"is a fantasy structure from which a man must be set free if he is to grow to maturity.\"\n\nFreud views the idea of [[God]] as being a version of the [[father]] image, and religious belief as at bottom infantile and [[neurosis|neurotic]]. Authoritarian religion, Freud believed, is dysfunctional and alienates man from himself.\n\n==== Carl Jung ====\nThe Swiss psychoanalyst [[Carl Jung]] (1875\u20131961) adopted a very different posture, one that was more sympathetic to religion and more concerned with a positive appreciation of [[religious symbolism]]. Jung considered the question of the metaphysical existence of God to be unanswerable by the psychologist and adopted a kind of [[agnosticism]].<ref>Jung, 'On the Nature of the Psyche,' C.W.8, Aphorisms 362, 420.</ref>\n\nJung postulated, in addition to the personal [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] (roughly adopting Freud's concept), the [[collective unconscious]], which is the repository of human experience and which contains \"[[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]]\" (i.e. basic images that are universal in that they recur regardless of culture). The irruption of these images from the unconscious into the realm of consciousness he viewed as the basis of [[religious experience]] and often of artistic creativity. Some of Jung's writings have been devoted to elucidating some of the archetypal [[symbol]]s, and include his work in [[comparative mythology]].\n\n==== Alfred Adler ====\nAustrian psychiatrist [[Alfred Adler]] (1870\u20131937), who parted ways with Freud, emphasized the role of goals and motivation in his ''Individual Psychology''. One of Adler's most famous ideas is that we try to compensate for inferiorities that we perceive in ourselves. A lack of power often lies at the root of feelings of inferiority. One way that religion enters into this picture is through our beliefs in God, which are characteristic of our tendency to strive for perfection and superiority. For example, in many religions, God is considered to be perfect and omnipotent, and commands people likewise to be perfect. If we, too, achieve perfection, we become one with God. By identifying with God in this way, we compensate for our imperfections and feelings of inferiority.\n\nOur ideas about [[God]] are important indicators of how we view the world. According to Adler, these ideas have changed over time, as our vision of the world \u2013 and our place in it \u2013 has changed. Consider this example that Adler offers: the traditional belief that people were placed deliberately on earth as God's ultimate creation is being replaced with the idea that people have evolved by [[natural selection]]. This coincides with a view of God not as a real being, but as an abstract representation of nature's forces. In this way, our view of God has changed from one that was concrete and specific to one that is more general. From Adler's vantage point, this is a relatively ineffective perception of God because it is so general that it fails to convey a strong sense of direction and purpose.\n\nAn important thing for Adler is that God (or the idea of God) motivates people to act and that those actions do have real consequences for ourselves and others. Our view of God is important because it embodies our goals and directs our social interactions.\n\nCompared to [[science]], another social movement, [[religion]] is more efficient because it motivates people more effectively. According to Adler, only when science begins to capture the same religious fervor, and promotes the welfare of all segments of society, will the two be more equal in peoples' eyes.\n\n==== Gordon Allport ====\nIn his classic book ''The Individual and His Religion'' (1950), [[Gordon Allport]] (1897\u20131967) illustrates how people may use religion in different ways.<ref name=\"Leak\">{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3852/is_200201/ai_n9029025/?tag=untagged|title=Exploratory factor analysis of the religious maturity scale|last=Leak|first=Gary K|year=2002|work=BNET UK|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc|accessdate=22 March 2010}}</ref> He makes a distinction between ''Mature religion'' and\n''Immature religion''. Mature religious sentiment is how Allport characterized the person whose approach to religion is dynamic, open-minded, and able to maintain links between inconsistencies. In contrast, immature religion is [[vanity|self-serving]] and generally represents the negative stereotypes that people have about religion.\nMore recently, this distinction has been encapsulated in the terms \"intrinsic religion\", referring to a genuine, heartfelt devout [[faith]], and \"extrinsic religion\", referring to a more utilitarian use of religion as a means to an end, such as [[church attendance]] to gain [[social status]]. These dimensions of religion were measured on the [[Extrinsic religious orientation|Religious Orientation Scale]] of Allport and Ross (1967). The third form of religious orientation has been described by [[Daniel Batson]]. This refers to treatment of religion as an open-ended search (Batson, Schoenrade & Ventis, 1993).\nMore specifically, it has been seen by Batson as comprising a willingness to view religious doubts positively, acceptance that religious orientation can change and existential complexity, the belief that one's religious beliefs should be shaped from personal crises that one has experienced in one's life. Batson refers to extrinsic, intrinsic and quests respectively as religion-as-means, religion-as-end, and religion-as-quest, and measures these constructs on the Religious Life Inventory (Batson, Schoenrade & Ventis, 1993).\n\n==== Erik H. Erikson ====\n[[Erik Erikson]] (1902\u20131994) is best known for his theory of psychological development, which has its roots in the psychoanalytic importance of [[identity (social science)|identity]] in personality. His biographies of [[Gandhi]] and [[Martin Luther]] reveal Erikson's positive view of religion. He considered religions to be important influences in successful [[personality development]] because they are the primary way that cultures promote the [[virtues]] associated with each stage of life. Religious [[ritual]]s facilitate this development. Erikson's theory has not benefited from systematic empirical study, but it remains an influential and well-regarded theory in the psychological study of religion.\n\n==== Erich Fromm ====\nThe American scholar [[Erich Fromm]] (1900\u20131980) modified the Freudian theory and produced a more complex account of the functions of religion. In his book ''[[Psychoanalysis and Religion]]'' he responded to Freud's theories by explaining that part of the modification is viewing the [[Oedipus complex]] as based not so much on sexuality as on a \"much more profound desire\", namely, the childish desire to remain attached to protecting figures. The right religion, in Fromm's estimation, can, in principle, foster an individual's highest potentialities, but religion in practice tends to relapse into being neurotic.<ref name=PsyRel>{{cite book |last1=Fromm |first1=Erich |authorlink1=Erich Fromm |title=Psychoanalysis and Religion |url=https://archive.org/details/psychoanalysisre00fromrich |url-access=registration |quote=psychoanalysis and religion. |accessdate=10 February 2010 |year=1950 |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |location=New Haven, CT, US |isbn=978-0-300-00089-4 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to Fromm, humans need a stable frame of reference. Religion fills this need. In effect, humans crave answers to questions that no other source of knowledge has an answer to, which only religion may seem to answer. However, a sense of free will must be given for religion to appear healthy. An authoritarian notion of religion appears detrimental.<ref name=Personality>{{cite book |title=Personality |last=Burger |first=Jerry |year=2007 |publisher=[[Cengage Learning]] |location=Stamford, CT, US |isbn=978-0-495-09786-0 |pages=122\u2013123 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FvGH0J_wHggC&dq=Fromm+Freud+Jung+religion |accessdate=10 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n==== Rudolf Otto ====\n[[Rudolf Otto]] (1869\u20131937) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Protestant]] theologian and scholar of [[comparative religion]]. Otto's most famous work, ''The Idea of the Holy'' (published first in 1917 as ''Das Heilige''), defines the concept of the holy as that which is ''[[numinous]]''. Otto explained the numinous as a \"non-rational, non-sensory experience or feeling whose primary and immediate object is outside the self.\" It is a mystery (Latin: ''mysterium tremendum'') that is both fascinating (''fascinans'') and terrifying at the same time; A mystery that causes trembling and fascination, attempting to explain that inexpressible and perhaps supernatural emotional reaction of [[Sense of wonder|wonder]] drawing us to seemingly ordinary and/or religious experiences of [[divine grace|grace]]. This sense of emotional wonder appears evident at the root of all religious experiences. Through this emotional wonder, we suspend our rational mind for non-rational possibilities.\n\n''The Idea of the Holy'' also set out a [[paradigm]] for the study of religion that focuses on the need to realize the religious as a non-reducible, original category in its own right. This paradigm was under much attack between approximately 1950 and 1990 but has made a strong comeback since then.\n\n=== Modern thinkers ===\nAutobiographal accounts of 20th-century psychology of religion as a field have been supplied by numerous modern psychologists of religion, primarily based in Europe, but also by several US-based psychologists such as [[Ralph W.

Jaynes hypothesized that hallucinated verbal commands helped non-conscious early man to perform tasks promoting human survival. Starting about 10,000 BCE, selective pressures favored the hallucinated verbal commands for social control, and they came to be perceived as an external, rather than internal, voice commanding the person to take some action. These were hence often explained as originating from invisible gods, spirits, ancestors, etc.<ref>{{Cite book| last=Jaynes | first=Julian | title=The origin of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind | publisher=Houghton Mifflin | year=2000 | isbn=978-0-618-05707-8 | pages=131\u2013143}}</ref>\n\n== Hypotheses on the role of religion ==\nThere are three primary hypotheses on the role of religion in the modern world.\n\n=== Secularization ===\nThe first hypothesis, [[secularization]], holds that science and technology will take the place of religion.<ref>{{cite book\n| author = Gill, R.\n| chapter = The future of religious participation and belief in Britain and beyond\n| editor = R.

The second measures three forms of religious orientation: religion as means (intrinsic), religion as end (extrinsic), and religion as quest. The third assesses spiritual maturity using two factors: Spiritual Support and Spiritual Openness.\n\n===Religious orientations and religious dimensions===\n{{Further|Sociology of religion}}\nSome questionnaires, such as the [[Religious Orientation Scale]], relate to different religious orientations, such as intrinsic and extrinsic religiousness, referring to different motivations for religious allegiance. A rather different approach, taken, for example, by Glock and Stark (1965), has been to list different dimensions of religion rather than different religious orientations, which relates to how an individual may manifest different forms of being religious. Glock and Stark's famous typology described five dimensions of religion \u2013 the doctrinal, the intellectual, the ethical-consequential, the ritual, and the experiential. In later work these authors subdivided the ritual dimension into devotional and public ritual, and also clarified that their distinction of religion along multiple dimensions was not identical to distinguishing religious orientations. Although some psychologists of religion have found it helpful to take a multidimensional approach to religion for the purpose of psychometric scale design, there has been, as Wulff (1997) explains, considerable controversy about whether religion should really be seen as multidimensional.\n\n===Questionnaires to assess religious experience===\nWhat we call religious experiences can differ greatly. Some reports exist of supernatural happenings that it would be difficult to explain from a rational, scientific point of view. On the other hand, there also exist the sort of testimonies that simply seem to convey a feeling of peace or oneness \u2013 something which most of us, religious or not, may possibly relate to. In categorizing religious experiences it is perhaps helpful to look at them as explicable through one of two theories: the Objectivist thesis or the Subjectivist thesis.\n\nAn objectivist would argue that the religious experience is a proof of God's existence. However, others have criticised the reliability of religious experiences. The English philosopher Thomas Hobbes asked how it was possible to tell the difference between talking to God in a dream, and dreaming about talking to God.<ref>{{cite book\n| author = Southwell, G.\n| chapter = Objectivist\n| title = Philosophy of Religion\n| publisher = UK\n| chapter-url =  http://www.philosophyonline.co.uk/pages/relex_main.htm#\n| accessdate = 26 April 2010\n}}</ref>\n\nThe Subjectivist view argues that it is not necessary to think of religious experiences as evidence for the existence of an actual being whom we call God. From this point of view, the important thing is the experience itself and the effect that it has on the individual.<ref>{{cite book\n| author = Southwell, G.\n| chapter = Subjectivist\n| title = Philosophy of Religion\n| publisher = UK\n| chapter-url =  http://www.philosophyonline.co.uk/pages/relex_main.htm#\n| accessdate = 26 April 2010\n}}</ref>\n\n== Developmental approaches to religion ==\n{{Main|James W. Fowler|Stages of faith development}}\n{{further|Psychology of religious conversion}}\n\nMany have looked at stage models, like those of [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Lawrence Kohlberg]], to explain how children develop ideas about God and religion in general.\n\nThe best known stage model of spiritual or religious development is that of [[James W. Fowler]], a [[developmental psychology|developmental psychologist]] at the [[Candler School of Theology]], in his ''Stages of Faith''.<ref>{{Cite book|isbn = 978-0-06-062866-6|title = Stages of Faith: The Psychology of Human Development|last1 = Fowler|first1 = James W.|date = 1995-09-15|url = https://archive.org/details/stagesoffaithpsy00fowl_0}}</ref> He follows Piaget and Kohlberg and has proposed a holistic staged development of [[faith]] (or spiritual development) across the lifespan.\n\nThe book-length study contains a framework and ideas which have generated a good deal of response from those interested in religion{{Who|date=July 2011}}, so it appears to have [[face validity]]. James Fowler proposes six stages of faith development:\n# Intuitive-projective\n# Symbolic Literal\n# Synthetic Conventional\n# Individuating\n# Paradoxical (conjunctive)\n# Universalising.\n\nAlthough there is evidence that children up to the age of twelve years do tend to be in the first two of these stages{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}, adults over the age of sixty-one show considerable variation in displays of qualities of Stages 3 and beyond{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}, most adults remaining in Stage 3 (Synthetic Conventional). Fowler's model has generated some empirical studies, and fuller descriptions of this research (and of these six stages) can be found in Wulff (1991).\n\nFowler's [[Scientific method|scientific research]] has been criticized for methodological weaknesses. Of Fowler's six stages, only the first two found empirical support{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}, and these were heavily based upon Piaget's stages of [[Theory of cognitive development|cognitive development]]. The tables and graphs in the book were presented in such a way that the last four stages appeared to be validated, but the requirements of [[Statistical#Statistical methods|statistical verification]] of the stages were not met. His study was not published in a journal, so was not peer-reviewed. Other critics{{Who|date=July 2011}} of Fowler have questioned whether his ordering of the stages really reflects his own commitment to a rather liberal Christian Protestant outlook, as if to say that people who adopt a similar viewpoint to Fowler are at higher stages of faith development. Nevertheless, the concepts Fowler introduced seemed to hit home with those in the circles of [[Religious studies|academic religion]]{{Who|date=July 2011}}, and have been an important starting point for various theories and subsequent studies{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}.\n\nOther theorists in developmental psychology have suggested that religiosity comes naturally to young children. Specifically, children may have a natural-born conception of mind-body dualism, which lends itself to beliefs that the mind may live on after the body dies. In addition, children have a tendency to see agency and human design where there is not, and prefer a creationist explanation of the world even when raised by parents who do not.<ref>{{Cite journal\n | author=Bloom, P. |date=January 2007\n | title=Religion is natural\n | journal = Developmental Science |volume= 10\n | issue= 1 |pages=147\u2013151\n | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7687.2007.00577.x\n|pmid=17181713\n |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2ee6648647185af711ed07441995af7bc7c11fe0\n }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal\n | doi = 10.1006/cogp.2001.0749 | pmid=11305883 | volume=42 | issue=3 | title=Cognitive and contextual factors in the emergence of diverse belief systems: creation versus evolution. |date=May 2001  | journal=Cogn Psychol | pages=217\u201366 | first=E | last=Evans\n| citeseerx=10.1.1.370.1532 }}</ref>\n\nResearchers have also investigated attachment system dynamics as a predictor of the religious conversion experience throughout childhood and adolescence.

Under the correspondence hypothesis, internal working models of a person's attachment figure is thought to perpetuate his or her perception of God as a secure base. Another hypothesis relating attachment style to the conversion experience is the compensation hypothesis,<ref>{{Cite journal\n | author = Kirkpatrick, L.A., Shaver, P.R.\n | title = Attachment theory and religion: Childhood attachments, religious beliefs, and conversion\n | journal = [[Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion]]\n | year = 1990\n | pages = 315\u2013334\n | doi=10.2307/1386461\n | volume=29| issue = 3\n | jstor = 1386461\n }}</ref> which states that individuals with insecure attachments are more likely to have a sudden conversion experience as they compensate for their insecure attachment relationship by seeking a relationship with God. \nResearchers have tested these hypotheses using longitudinal studies and individuals' self narratives of their conversation experience.

Does that count, or should there be more references within the section itself?-->\n[[Evolutionary psychology]] is based on the hypothesis that, just like the cardiac, pulmonary, urinary, and immune systems, [[cognition]] has a functional structure with a genetic basis, and therefore appeared through [[natural selection]]. Like other organs and tissues, this functional structure should be universally shared among humans and should solve important problems of survival and reproduction. Evolutionary psychologists seek to understand cognitive processes by understanding the survival and reproductive functions they might serve.\n\n[[Pascal Boyer]] is one of the leading figures in the cognitive psychology of religion, a new field of inquiry that is less than fifteen years old, which accounts for the psychological processes that underlie religious thought and practice. In his book ''Religion Explained'', Boyer shows that there is no simple explanation for religious [[consciousness]]. Boyer is mainly concerned with explaining the various psychological processes involved in the acquisition and transmission of ideas concerning the gods. Boyer builds on the ideas of cognitive anthropologists [[Dan Sperber]] and [[Scott Atran]], who first argued that religious cognition represents a by-product of various evolutionary adaptations, including folk psychology, and purposeful violations of innate expectations about how the world is constructed (for example, bodiless beings with thoughts and emotions) that make religious cognitions striking and memorable.\n\nReligious persons acquire religious ideas and practices through social exposure. The child of a [[Zen]] [[Buddhist]] will not become an evangelical [[Christians|Christian]] or a [[Zulu people|Zulu]] warrior without the relevant cultural experience. While mere exposure does not cause a particular religious outlook (a person may have been raised a [[Roman Catholic]] but leave the church), nevertheless some exposure seems required \u2013 this person will never invent Roman Catholicism out of thin air. Boyer says [[cognitive science]] can help us to understand the psychological mechanisms that account for these manifest correlations and in so doing enable us to better understand the nature of religious belief and practice.\n\nBoyer moves outside the leading currents in mainstream [[cognitive psychology]] and suggests that we can use evolutionary biology to unravel the relevant mental architecture. Our brains are, after all, biological objects, and the best naturalistic account of their development in nature is Darwin's [[theory of evolution]]. To the extent that mental architecture exhibits intricate processes and structures, it is plausible to think that this is the result of evolutionary processes working over vast periods of time. Like all biological systems, the mind is optimised to promote survival and reproduction in the evolutionary environment. On this view all specialised cognitive functions broadly serve those [[reproductive]] ends.\n\nFor [[Steven Pinker]] the universal propensity toward religious belief is a genuine scientific puzzle. He thinks that [[adaptationist]] explanations for religion do not meet the criteria for adaptations. An alternative explanation is that religious psychology is a by-product of many parts of the mind that originally evolved for other purposes.\n\n== Religion and prayer ==\nReligious practice oftentimes manifests itself in some form of [[prayer]]. Recent studies have focused specifically on the effects of prayer on health. Measures of prayer and the above measures of spirituality evaluate different characteristics and should not be considered synonymous.\n\n[[Prayer]] is fairly prevalent in the United States.

Their second and third factors were upward reaching (toward God) and outward reaching (toward others). This study appears to support the contemporary model of prayer as connection (whether to the self, higher being, or others).\n\nDein and Littlewood (2008) suggest that an individual's prayer life can be viewed on a spectrum ranging from immature to mature. A progression on the scale is characterized by a change in the perspective of the purpose of prayer. Rather than using prayer as a means of changing the reality of a situation, a more mature individual will use prayer to request assistance in coping with immutable problems and draw closer to God or others. This change in perspective has been shown to be associated with an individual's passage through adolescence.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Dein Simon, Littlewood Roland | year = 2008 | title = The Psychology of Prayer and the Development of the Prayer Experience Questionnaire | url = | journal = Mental Health, Religion & Culture | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 39\u201352 | doi=10.1080/13674670701384396}}</ref>\n\nPrayer appears to have health implications.

The study included a sample size of 2306 students attending Protestant and Catholic schools in the highly religious culture of Northern Ireland. The data shows a negative correlation between prayer frequency and psychoticism. The data also shows that, in Catholic students, frequent prayer has a positive correlation to neuroticism scores.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Francis Leslie J., Robbins Mandy, Alan Lewis Christopher, Barnes L.

Leuba]] (1868\u20131946), in ''A Psychological Study of Religion'', accounts for mystical experience psychologically and physiologically, pointing to analogies with certain drug-induced experiences. Leuba argued forcibly for a naturalistic treatment of religion, which he considered to be necessary if religious psychology were to be looked at scientifically. Shamans all over the world and in different cultures have traditionally used drugs, especially psychedelics, for their religious experiences. In these communities the absorption of [[Psychoactive drug|drugs]] leads to dreams (visions) through sensory distortion.\n\n[[William James]] was also interested in mystical experiences from a drug-induced perspective, leading him to make some experiments with [[nitrous oxide]] and even peyote. He concludes that while the revelations of the mystic hold true, they hold true only for the mystic; for others they are certainly ideas to be considered, but hold no claim to truth without personal experience of such.\n\n== Religion and mental illness ==\n{{see also|Religion and schizophrenia|Mental health of Jesus}}\n\nAlthough many researchers have brought evidence for a positive role that religion plays in health, others have shown that religious beliefs, practices, and experiences may be linked to [[mental illness]]es of various kind<ref name=\"JNCN\">{{cite journal |last=Murray |first=Evan D. |last2=Cunningham |first2=Miles G. |last3=Price |first3=Bruce H. |title=The Role of Psychotic Disorders in Religious History Considered |journal=[[Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences]] |publisher=[[American Psychiatric Association]] |volume=24 |issue=4 |date=October 2012 |pages=410\u2013426 |doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11090214 |issn=1545-7222 |oclc=823065628 |pmid=23224447|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/14d7b462fa0d4041fb1e2685b62f9c60c09a5078 }}</ref> ([[mood disorders]], [[personality disorders]], and [[psychiatric disorders]]).<ref name=\"JNCN\" /> In 2012 a team of [[psychiatrists]], [[Behaviorism|behavioral psychologists]], [[neurologists]], and [[Neuropsychiatry|neuropsychiatrists]] from the [[Harvard Medical School]] published research which suggested the development of a new diagnostic category of psychiatric disorders related to [[religious delusion]] and [[hyperreligiosity]].<ref name=\"JNCN\" />\n\nThey compared the thoughts and behaviors of the most important figures in the [[Bible]] ([[Abraham]], [[Moses]], [[Jesus Christ]], and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]])<ref name=\"JNCN\" /> with patients affected by mental disorders related to the [[Spectrum disorder#Psychosis|psychotic spectrum]] using different clusters of disorders and diagnostic criteria ([[DSM-IV-TR]]),<ref name=\"JNCN\" /> and concluded that these Biblical figures \"may have had psychotic symptoms that contributed inspiration for their revelations\",<ref name=\"JNCN\" /> such as [[schizophrenia]], [[schizoaffective disorder]], [[Bipolar disorder|manic depression]], [[delusional disorder]], [[Grandiose delusions|delusions of grandeur]], [[Auditory hallucination|auditory]]-[[visual hallucination]]s, [[paranoia]], [[Geschwind syndrome]] (Paul especially), and abnormal experiences associated with [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] (TLE).<ref name=\"JNCN\" /> The authors suggest that Jesus sought to condemn himself to death (\"[[Suicide methods#Indirect suicide|suicide by proxy]]\").<ref name=\"JNCN\" />\n\nThe research went further and also focused on [[Social psychology|social models]] of [[psychopathology]],<ref name=\"JNCN\" /> analyzing [[new religious movements]] and charismatic [[Cult|cult leaders]] such as [[David Koresh]], leader of the [[Branch Davidians]],<ref name=\"JNCN\" /> and [[Marshall Applewhite]], founder of the [[Heaven's Gate (religious group)|Heaven's Gate cult]].<ref name=\"JNCN\" /> The researchers concluded that \"If David Koresh and Marshall Applewhite are appreciated as having psychotic-spectrum beliefs, then the premise becomes untenable that the diagnosis of psychosis must rigidly rely upon an inability to maintain a social group. A subset of individuals with psychotic symptoms appears able to form intense social bonds and communities despite having an extremely distorted view of reality. The existence of a better socially functioning subset of individuals with psychotic-type symptoms is corroborated by research indicating that psychotic-like experiences, including both bizarre and non-bizarre delusion-like beliefs, are frequently found in the general population.

In contrast to such an approach, psychoanalyst Robin S. Brown argues for the extent to which our spiritual commitments remain unconscious.

Pastoral psychology is also concerned with improving the practice of [[chaplain]]s in [[healthcare]] and in the [[military]]. One major concern of pastoral psychology is to improve the practice of [[pastoral counseling]]. Pastoral psychology is a topic of interest for professional journals such as ''[[Pastoral Psychology (journal)|Pastoral Psychology]]'', the ''[[Journal of Psychology and Christianity]]'', and the ''[[Journal of Psychology and Theology]]''. In 1984, [[Thomas C. Oden|Thomas Oden]] severely criticized mid-20th-century [[pastoral care]] and the pastoral psychology that guided it as having entirely abandoned its classical/traditional sources, and having become overwhelmingly dominated by modern psychological influences from [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Carl Rogers|Rogers]], and others.<ref name=oden84>{{cite book\n |title       = Care of souls in the classic tradition\n |last        = Oden\n |first       = Thomas C.\n |authorlink  = Thomas C.

In Tables 1 through 3, he demonstrated that in pastoral care textbooks, citations to psychologists (such as [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Carl Jung|Jung]], and [[Carl Rogers|Rogers]]) had entirely replaced citations to traditional pastoral care thinkers (such as [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Gregory the Great]], and [[John Chrysostom|Chrysostom]]) between the late 19th century and the mid-20th century.</ref> More recently, others have described pastoral psychology as a field that experiences a tension between psychology and [[theology]].<ref>{{cite journal\n |author=Ermanno Pavesi\n |year=2010\n |title=Pastoral psychology as a field of tension between theology and psychology\n |journal=Christian Bioethics\n |volume=16\n |issue=1\n |pages=9\u201329\n |doi= 10.1093/cb/cbq001\n |issn=1744-4195}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Attachment theory and psychology of religion]]\n* [[Fear of God]]\n* ''[[Issues in Science and Religion]]''\n* [[Magical thinking]]\n* [[Mythopoeic thought]]\n* [[Philosophy of religion]]\n* [[:Category:Psychology of religion journals|Psychology of religion journals]]\n** ''[[International Journal for the Psychology of Religion]]''\n* [[Religious paranoia]]\n* [[Science and religion]]\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Adler, A., & Jahn, E., ''Religion and Psychology'', Frankfurt, 1933.\n* Allport, G.W. & Ross, J.M., ''Personal Religious Orientation and Prejudice'', Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 1967.\n* Allport, G.
