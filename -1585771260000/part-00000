Bottlenose dolphins gained popularity from [[aquarium]] shows and television programs such as ''[[Flipper (1964 TV series)|Flipper]]''. They have also been trained by militaries to locate [[sea mine]]s or detect and mark enemy divers. In some areas, they cooperate with local fishermen by driving fish into their nets and eating the fish that escape. Some encounters with humans are harmful to the dolphins: people hunt them for food, and dolphins are killed inadvertently as a [[cetacean bycatch|bycatch]] of [[tuna]] fishing and by getting caught in [[crab traps]].\n\nThe deepest dive ever recorded for a bottlenose dolphin was 300 meters (990 feet).

A broadband burst pulse of clicking sounds is emitted in a focused beam in front of the dolphin. When the clicking sounds hit an object in the water, like a fish or rock, they bounce off and come back to the dolphin as echoes. Echolocation tells the dolphins the shape, size, speed, distance, and location of the object.<ref name=\"auto\"/> To hear the returning echo, they have two small ear openings behind the eyes, but most sound waves are transmitted to the inner ear through the lower jaw. As the object of interest is approached, the echo becomes booming, and the dolphins adjust by decreasing the intensity of the emitted sounds. (This contrasts with [[bat]]s and sonar, which reduce the sensitivity of the sound receptor.) The interclick interval also decreases as the animal nears the target. Evidently, the dolphin waits for each click's echo before clicking again.

The breeding season produces significant physiological changes in males. At that time, the testes enlarge, enabling them to hold more sperm. Large amounts of sperm allow a male to wash away the previous suitor's sperm, while leaving some of his own for fertilization. Also, sperm concentration markedly increases. Having less sperm for out-of-season social mating means it wastes less. This suggests sperm production is energetically expensive. Males have large testes in relation to their body size.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|isbn=978-0-8050-1950-6\n|authors=Connor Richard C., Peterson, Dawn M.\n|year=1994\n|title=The Lives of Whales and Dolphins\n|publisher=Henry Holt and Company\n|location=New York.\n|url=https://archive.org/details/livesofwhalesd00conn\n}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[breeding season]], males compete for access to females.

For example, in the town of [[Laguna, Brazil|Laguna]] in south Brazil, a pod of bottlenose dolphins resides in the estuary, and some of its members cooperate with humans.  These cooperating dolphins are individually recognized by the local fishermen, who name them.  The fishermen typically stand up to their knees in the shallow waters or sit in canoes, waiting for the dolphins. Now and then, one or more dolphins appear, driving the fish towards the line of fishermen.

Tuna fishing crews have been the most responsible for the largest number of deaths. In 1972, the U.S government passed a law limiting the number of dolphins that could be killed yearly by tuna fishing crews. Dolphins in the United Kingdom have also been found to contain high levels of pollutants in their tissues. Heavy metals including mercury, PCB's and DDT are of great concern. These pollutants can cause harm in dolphins growth development, reproduction, and immunity. Since the mid-1990s, hundreds of dolphins have been trained to perform in shows presented by aquariums, zoos, and amusement parks.

A broadband burst pulse of clicking sounds is emitted in a focused beam in front of the dolphin. When the clicking sounds hit an object in the water, like a fish or rock, they bounce off and come back to the dolphin as echoes. Echolocation tells the dolphins the shape, size, speed, distance, and location of the object.<ref name=\"auto\"/> To hear the returning echo, they have two small ear openings behind the eyes, but most sound waves are transmitted to the inner ear through the lower jaw. As the object of interest is approached, the echo becomes booming, and the dolphins adjust by decreasing the intensity of the emitted sounds. (This contrasts with [[bat]]s and sonar, which reduce the sensitivity of the sound receptor.) The interclick interval also decreases as the animal nears the target. Evidently, the dolphin waits for each click's echo before clicking again. Echolocation details, such as signal strength, spectral qualities, and discrimination, are well understood by researchers.<ref name=\"Au\">\n{{cite book| last=Au| first=Whitlow| year=1993| title=The Sonar of Dolphins| location=New York| publisher=Springer-Verlag| isbn=978-3-540-97835-0}}</ref> Bottlenose dolphins are also able to extract shape information, suggesting they are able to form an \"echoic image\" or sound picture of their targets.<ref name=\"Pack 1995\">\n{{cite journal |vauthors=Pack AA, Herman LM |title=Sensory integration in the bottlenosed dolphin: immediate recognition of complex shapes across the senses of echolocation and vision |journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=98 |issue=2 Pt 1 |pages=722\u201333 |year=1995|pmid=7642811 |doi=10.1121/1.413566|bibcode = 1995ASAJ...98..722P }}</ref>\n\nDolphins have sharp eyesight.

The breeding season produces significant physiological changes in males. At that time, the testes enlarge, enabling them to hold more sperm. Large amounts of sperm allow a male to wash away the previous suitor's sperm, while leaving some of his own for fertilization. Also, sperm concentration markedly increases. Having less sperm for out-of-season social mating means it wastes less. This suggests sperm production is energetically expensive.

For example, in the town of [[Laguna, Brazil|Laguna]] in south Brazil, a pod of bottlenose dolphins resides in the estuary, and some of its members cooperate with humans.  These cooperating dolphins are individually recognized by the local fishermen, who name them.  The fishermen typically stand up to their knees in the shallow waters or sit in canoes, waiting for the dolphins. Now and then, one or more dolphins appear, driving the fish towards the line of fishermen.  One dolphin then displays a unique body movement outside the water, which serves as a signal to the fishermen to cast their nets (the entire sequence is shown here,<ref name=\":0\" /> and a detailed description of the signal's characteristics is available here<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHUZhmJ0JSQ|title=Cooperative Dolphins of Laguna: Data on Nature of Signal (video and detailed description)|last=Dr. Moti Nissani|date=2008|website=|access-date=}}</ref>).

In ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' and one of its sequels, ''[[So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish]]'', the dolphins try to warn humans of Earth's impending destruction, but their behavior was misinterpreted as playful [[acrobatics]]. Bottlenose dolphins are central to [[David Brin]]'s series of [[Uplift Universe]] novels, particularly ''[[Startide Rising]]'', where they are one of the four Earth species (along with [[chimpanzee]]s, [[gorilla]]s, and dogs) to have been '[[biological uplift|uplifted]]' to [[sentience]]. Bottlenose dolphins are primary characters in [[Anne McCaffrey]]'s ''[[Dragonriders of Pern]]'' series, especially ''[[The Dolphins of Pern]]''.

Tuna fishing crews have been the most responsible for the largest number of deaths. In 1972, the U.S government passed a law limiting the number of dolphins that could be killed yearly by tuna fishing crews. Dolphins in the United Kingdom have also been found to contain high levels of pollutants in their tissues. Heavy metals including mercury, PCB's and DDT are of great concern. These pollutants can cause harm in dolphins growth development, reproduction, and immunity. Since the mid-1990s, hundreds of dolphins have been trained to perform in shows presented by aquariums, zoos, and amusement parks.

He was educated at [[Stanford University]], where he was initiated into the [[Sigma Chi]] fraternity and was briefly a teammate of [[Tiger Woods]]. He was a three-time all [[Pac-10]] and was a member of the University's [[NCAA Division I Men's Golf Championships|NCAA Championship]] team in 1994. He won the 1993 [[Sahalee Players Championship]], and turned professional in 1995.\n\n==Professional golf career==\nIn [[1998 Nike Tour|1998]], he won a [[Nike Tour]] (later named the Buy.com Tour, Nationwide Tour, Web.com Tour, and now [[Korn Ferry Tour]]) event, the [[Lakeland Classic]], in a playoff, thus assuring himself of remaining on the tour the following year and securing a five-year exemption from the first round of [[Qualifying School]] (Q-School). Also in 1998, he attained a career highlight by finishing tied for 23rd at the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], and briefly contending for the lead before falling back.\n\nIn late 1999, by finishing 14th on the Nike Tour money list, Martin secured a spot on the PGA Tour. He finished 179th on the money list in 2000 and failed to keep his card through his earnings on the PGA Tour. As a PGA Tour cardholder for 2000, he began at the final stage of that year's Q-School, but narrowly failed to keep his spot (finishing tied for 37th, when the top 35 and ties qualified), relegating him to the Buy.com Tour.\n\nMartin kept full status on the Nike Tour through 2003, but failed to make the Q-School finals in 2003, relegating him to a limited status in 2004, a year in which he played nine tournaments. In 2004, following the expiration of his five-year exemption from the first round of Q-School, he advanced from the first to the second of the three rounds but no further, and only had limited status in 2005, playing nine tournaments on the tour and making two cuts.  He played five events in 2006, making the cut once, for a total earnings of $1,328.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatour.com/content/pgatour/players/player.20445.casey-martin.html/career |title=Casey Martin \u2013 Career |publisher=PGA Tour |accessdate=November 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn June 4, 2012, Martin qualified for the [[2012 U.S. Open (golf)|2012 U.S. Open]], winning a sectional at Emerald Valley Golf Club.\n\n===Korn Ferry Tour results===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

Sports profile] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523092716/http://sports.yahoo.com/golf/pga/news?slug=ap-oregon-martin&prov=ap&type=lgns |date=May 23, 2011 }}</ref> He has indicated he hopes to continue to play, where it fits in with his coaching schedule.<ref>[http://www.cstv.com/sports/m-golf/uwire/051006aae.html College Sports TV]</ref> However, he did not play any professional events or attempt Q-School in 2007 or 2008. Oregon won the [[2016 NCAA Division I Men's Golf Championship]].\n\n==Personal==\nMartin suffers from a [[birth defect]] in his right leg known as [[Klippel\u2013Tr\u00e9naunay syndrome]]. In ''[[PGA Tour, Inc. v. Martin]]'', Martin successfully sued the [[PGA Tour]] in 2001 for the right to use a [[golf cart]] during competition under the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]]. During the years that the suit wound through the courts, he enjoyed limited success on the golf course, and throughout, was permitted to use a golf cart.\n\nIn October 2019, while attempting to retrieve a garbage can from the street he lived on, he misjudged a step between the street, which was under construction, and his curb, breaking his defective leg. He took a medical leave from coaching during the Ducks' fall 2019 golf schedule, with assistant Brad Lanning taking over until he returned to campus for the spring season (which was ultimately shortened due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]]). Because his condition has prevented his fracture from properly healing, he has used crutches since returning to campus.\n\nIn a March 2020 interview with ''[[The Register-Guard]]'', the daily newspaper for Oregon's home of [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]], Martin said about the prospect of losing his leg, \"I was grateful that I was able to hold it off for a long time.

He was educated at [[Stanford University]], where he was initiated into the [[Sigma Chi]] fraternity and was briefly a teammate of [[Tiger Woods]]. He was a three-time all [[Pac-10]] and was a member of the University's [[NCAA Division I Men's Golf Championships|NCAA Championship]] team in 1994. He won the 1993 [[Sahalee Players Championship]], and turned professional in 1995.\n\n==Professional golf career==\nIn [[1998 Nike Tour|1998]], he won a [[Nike Tour]] (later named the Buy.com Tour, Nationwide Tour, Web.com Tour, and now [[Korn Ferry Tour]]) event, the [[Lakeland Classic]], in a playoff, thus assuring himself of remaining on the tour the following year and securing a five-year exemption from the first round of [[Qualifying School]] (Q-School). Also in 1998, he attained a career highlight by finishing tied for 23rd at the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], and briefly contending for the lead before falling back.\n\nIn late 1999, by finishing 14th on the Nike Tour money list, Martin secured a spot on the PGA Tour. He finished 179th on the money list in 2000 and failed to keep his card through his earnings on the PGA Tour. As a PGA Tour cardholder for 2000, he began at the final stage of that year's Q-School, but narrowly failed to keep his spot (finishing tied for 37th, when the top 35 and ties qualified), relegating him to the Buy.com Tour.\n\nMartin kept full status on the Nike Tour through 2003, but failed to make the Q-School finals in 2003, relegating him to a limited status in 2004, a year in which he played nine tournaments. In 2004, following the expiration of his five-year exemption from the first round of Q-School, he advanced from the first to the second of the three rounds but no further, and only had limited status in 2005, playing nine tournaments on the tour and making two cuts.  He played five events in 2006, making the cut once, for a total earnings of $1,328.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatour.com/content/pgatour/players/player.20445.casey-martin.html/career |title=Casey Martin \u2013 Career |publisher=PGA Tour |accessdate=November 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn June 4, 2012, Martin qualified for the [[2012 U.S. Open (golf)|2012 U.S. Open]], winning a sectional at Emerald Valley Golf Club.\n\n===Korn Ferry Tour results===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

Oregon won the [[2016 NCAA Division I Men's Golf Championship]].\n\n==Personal==\nMartin suffers from a [[birth defect]] in his right leg known as [[Klippel\u2013Tr\u00e9naunay syndrome]]. In ''[[PGA Tour, Inc. v. Martin]]'', Martin successfully sued the [[PGA Tour]] in 2001 for the right to use a [[golf cart]] during competition under the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]]. During the years that the suit wound through the courts, he enjoyed limited success on the golf course, and throughout, was permitted to use a golf cart.\n\nIn October 2019, while attempting to retrieve a garbage can from the street he lived on, he misjudged a step between the street, which was under construction, and his curb, breaking his defective leg. He took a medical leave from coaching during the Ducks' fall 2019 golf schedule, with assistant Brad Lanning taking over until he returned to campus for the spring season (which was ultimately shortened due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]]). Because his condition has prevented his fracture from properly healing, he has used crutches since returning to campus.\n\nIn a March 2020 interview with ''[[The Register-Guard]]'', the daily newspaper for Oregon's home of [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]], Martin said about the prospect of losing his leg, \"I was grateful that I was able to hold it off for a long time. I thought it would happen at 27 not 47. But it has happened. I\u2019m just going to do everything in my power to save my leg.\" He added that he had considered an amputation, noting that a prosthesis would enable him to walk without pain, but noted, \"If I lose my leg, it would be an above-the-knee deal, and it\u2019s pretty risky for my situation anyway. It\u2019s something that I\u2019ve recognized could happen, but I would really rather not, if I could save it, because of the risks.\" At the time of the interview, Martin was scheduled to travel to Washington state to be fitted for a special carbon-fiber leg brace that could potentially redirect his body weight in a way that would allow the fracture to heal.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.registerguard.com/sports/20200328/oregon-ducks-menrsquos-golf-coach-casey-martin-fighting-to-save-his-leg |title=Oregon Ducks men\u2019s golf coach Casey Martin fighting to save his leg |first=Ryan |last=Thorburn |newspaper=The Register-Guard |date=March 28, 2020 |accessdate=March 31, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[1999 Nike Tour graduates]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{PGATour player|20445}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111217015709/http://www.goducks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=4383&SPID=246&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=500&ATCLID=623444&Q_SEASON=2010 Casey Martin Bio at University of Oregon Athletics site]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Martin, Casey}}\n[[Category:American male golfers]]\n[[Category:Oregon Ducks men's golf coaches]]\n[[Category:Stanford Cardinal men's golfers]]\n[[Category:PGA Tour golfers]]\n[[Category:Korn Ferry Tour graduates]]\n[[Category:Golfers from Oregon]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Eugene, Oregon]]\n[[Category:1972 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n", "name_user": "Dale Arnett", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePersonal", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_Martin"}
