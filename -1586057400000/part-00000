It is the largest airport in Tatarstan, and the 15th busiest airport in Russia. The Kazan International Airport serves the nearly 3.8 million citizens of the region.\n\n==History==\n[[File:ES1-021, aeroexpress in Kazan.jpg|thumb|Kazan [[Aeroexpress]]-[[Lastochka]]]] \n[[File:\u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0430\u044d\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442 \u0432\u043d\u0443\u0442\u0440\u04381.jpg|thumb|Inside Kazan Airport, departure hall]]\nOn 15 September 1979, Kazan 2 was completed. On 28 September 1984, Kazan 1 (located inside the city) was shut down, and Kazan 2 was renamed to Kazan Domestic Airport. On 21 February 1986, Kazan Airport gained international rank. This was a drastic announcement, because the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|USSR Council of Ministers]] only rarely allowed its citizens to [[Visa policy of Russia#Exit|fly out]] of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]].\n\nIn 1991, after the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]], the Tatarstan region separated from USSR's single [[Aeroflot]] airline and created [[Tatarstan Airlines]]. This airline didn't gain an efficient amount of investments in its 22 years of service,  and its operating license was officially terminated on 31 December 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ch-aviation.ch/portal/news/24431-ak-bars-aero-wins-volga-contract-to-absorb-tatarstan-airs-assets|title=Ak Bars Aero wins Volga contract; to absorb Tatarstan Air's assets|website=Ch-aviation.ch|date=27 December 2013|access-date=9 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn 26 October 1992, Kazan got its first international regular flight: Kazan - Istanbul - Kazan. This flight was (and still is) operated by [[Turkish Airlines]] and 145 annual trips are made to and from Istanbul, making it the most popular international route.\n\nIn 2008, Tatarstan's president, [[Mintimer Shaimiev]], after winning the bid for the [[2013 Summer Universiade|2013 Universiade Olympic Games]], began creating a set of major reform projects of Kazan. Apart from repairing the streets, bringing in investments, integrating English language and improving the bus route system in Kazan,  Shaimiev also began to completely redesign Kazan's airport. He designed the blueprints for Terminal 1A, and planned out the complete refining of the airport between 2008-2025. Shaimiev's successor and today's president of Tatarstan, [[Rustam Minnikhanov]], used the blueprints, which were made in 2009, to begin the construction of Terminal 1A and a complete redesign of Terminal 1 (essentially also a new reconstruction).\n\nFirst, a new 3700 meter runway was built, and [[Runway edge lights|edge lights]] were added on both of the runways. This made it possible for the airport to operate 24/7. In 2012, a new [[Aircraft rescue and firefighting|airport fire station]] was built. In 2012 the construction of Terminal 1A began. Later that  year, Terminal 1 began its own renovation. Terminal 1A was officially opened on 7 November 2012. Terminal 1 finished renovations on 22 June 2013.\n\nToday, the new airport has more than 30 [[Check in|check-in]] slots and seven [[conveyor belt]]s. It has three separate duty-free shops, selling merchandise such as alcohol, cigars and cigarettes, chocolates. It offers popular brands such as [[Costa coffee|Costa Coffee]]. The airport can sustain around three million passengers. Further expansions and  the creation of Terminal 2 will occur before the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].\n\nFollowing the [[Skytrax|Skytrax Airport and Airline Awards]], Kazan Airport was nominated for 4 stars in 2014, and was called Russia's and CIS's best airport.\n\nThanks to the opening of new air routes and to the increase of flights in the existing ones, the Kazan Airport, at the beginning of the month of December 2017 reached the record of 2.5 million passengers transported in less than a year.<ref>http://aviationews.net/blog/kazan-airport-reaches-record-25-million-passengers/</ref>\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n{{Airport-dest-list\n<!-- -->\n| [[Aeroflot]] | [[Frankfurt

It is the largest airport in Tatarstan, and the 15th busiest airport in Russia. Kazan Airport served nearly 3.8 million citizens of the region{{when|date=May 2017}}.\n\n==History==\n[[File:ES1-021, aeroexpress in Kazan.jpg|thumb|Kazan [[Aeroexpress]]-[[Lastochka]]]] \n[[File:\u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0430\u044d\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442 \u0432\u043d\u0443\u0442\u0440\u04381.jpg|thumb|Inside Kazan Airport, departure hall]]\nOn 15 September 1979, Kazan 2 was completed. On 28 September 1984, Kazan 1 (located inside the city) was shut down, and Kazan 2 was renamed to Kazan Domestic Airport. On 21 February 1986, Kazan Airport gained international rank. This was a drastic announcement, because the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|USSR Council of Ministers]] only rarely allowed its citizens to [[Visa policy of Russia#Exit|fly out]] of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]].\n\nIn 1991, after the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]], the Tatarstan region separated from USSR's single [[Aeroflot]] airline and created [[Tatarstan Airlines]]. This airline didn't gain an efficient amount of investments in its 22 years of service,  and its operating license was officially terminated on 31 December 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ch-aviation.ch/portal/news/24431-ak-bars-aero-wins-volga-contract-to-absorb-tatarstan-airs-assets|title=Ak Bars Aero wins Volga contract; to absorb Tatarstan Air's assets|website=Ch-aviation.ch|date=27 December 2013|access-date=9 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn 26 October 1992, Kazan got its first international regular flight: Kazan - Istanbul - Kazan. This flight was (and still is) operated by [[Turkish Airlines]] and 145 annual trips are made to and from Istanbul, making it the most popular international route.\n\nIn 2008, Tatarstan's president, [[Mintimer Shaimiev]], after winning the bid for the [[2013 Summer Universiade|2013 Universiade Olympic Games]], began creating a set of major reform projects of Kazan. Apart from repairing the streets, bringing in investments, integrating English language and improving the bus route system in Kazan,  Shaimiev also began to completely redesign Kazan's airport. He designed the blueprints for Terminal 1A, and planned out the complete refining of the airport between 2008-2025. Shaimiev's successor and today's president of Tatarstan, [[Rustam Minnikhanov]], used the blueprints, which were made in 2009, to begin the construction of Terminal 1A and a complete redesign of Terminal 1 (essentially also a new reconstruction).\n\nFirst, a new 3700 meter runway was built, and [[Runway edge lights|edge lights]] were added on both of the runways. This made it possible for the airport to operate 24/7. In 2012, a new [[Aircraft rescue and firefighting|airport fire station]] was built. In 2012 the construction of Terminal 1A began. Later that  year, Terminal 1 began its own renovation. Terminal 1A was officially opened on 7 November 2012. Terminal 1 finished renovations on 22 June 2013.\n\nToday, the new airport has more than 30 [[Check in|check-in]] slots and seven [[conveyor belt]]s. It has three separate duty-free shops, selling merchandise such as alcohol, cigars and cigarettes, chocolates. It offers popular brands such as [[Costa coffee|Costa Coffee]]. The airport can sustain around three million passengers. Further expansions and  the creation of Terminal 2 will occur before the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].\n\nFollowing the [[Skytrax|Skytrax Airport and Airline Awards]], Kazan Airport was nominated for 4 stars in 2014, and was called Russia's and CIS's best airport.\n\nThanks to the opening of new air routes and to the increase of flights in the existing ones, the Kazan Airport, at the beginning of the month of December 2017 reached the record of 2.5 million passengers transported in less than a year.<ref>http://aviationews.net/blog/kazan-airport-reaches-record-25-million-passengers/</ref>\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n{{Airport-dest-list\n<!-- -->\n| [[Aeroflot]] | [[Frankfurt

During his five years at Snow, Benson raised more money for the school than in the previous 117 years of the institution's history combined.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}\n\n===Southern Utah University===\nBenson was appointed the president of [[Southern Utah University]] on November 10, 2006, by the Utah State Board of Regents. Two weeks into his presidency, Benson secured the largest donation in the school's history, which was used to expand SUU's Science Complex.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,650206211,00.html|title=Deseret News  Regents name Benson to head SUU|accessdate=November 13, 2019}}</ref> In March 2014, Benson returned to Cedar City to help celebrate the conclusion of \"The Future is Rising\" campaign which brought in a record $105 million in seven years for Southern Utah University.\n\n===Eastern Kentucky University===\n\nOn April 5, 2013, it was announced that Benson was unanimously selected to become the 12th president of [[Eastern Kentucky University]] as the University's Board of Regents was seeking a \"bold, visionary leader.\"  He began August 1, 2013. Throughout his more than 25-year career in public higher education, Benson has devoted himself to students and their academic success. He is an accomplished communicator and scholar committed to diversity and expanding global academic opportunities, and is a proven financial manager who is focused on developing and sustaining political and external support for EKU.\n\nIn 2015, Benson worked with retired EKU Archivist Charles Hay and senior Damir Siahkoohi and proposed to the EKU Board of Regents that Dr. Mary Roark, Eastern\u2019s \u201cacting\u201d president in 1909-10, be named officially as Eastern\u2019s second president. The Board took this action at its February 2, 2015, meeting.  Dr. Mary Roark assumed the presidency when her husband Ruric Nevel Roark died suddenly after a short illness, and was the first female to serve as president of any public college or university in the state of Kentucky. Benson thus became Eastern\u2019s 13th president.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eku.edu/news/regents-designate-mary-roark-easterns-2nd-president|title=Regents Designate Mary Roark as Eastern's 2nd President|website=www.eku.edu|accessdate=November 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn December 11th, 2019 President Benson announced his resignation from Eastern Kentucky University effective January 6th, 2020.

In February 2020, Benson was awarded the Vision Award for Education by Bluegrass Tomorrow in recognition of his service to EKU and the Commonwealth.\n\nBenson served on the Council of Presidents for the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges (AGB) and as a member on the Task Force for University Partnerships for the American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU). Benson also served as the convener for all presidents of public universities in Kentucky for two years.\n\nIn 2009, Governor Jon M. Huntsman named Benson to a four-year term as member of the seven-person Utah Appellate Courts Nominating Commission. Benson served as Chair of the Presidents\u2019 Council for the Summit League, SUU\u2019s Division I athletic conference. Benson also served on the Advisory Board of the Cedar City Airport. Benson has completed a two-year term as the Chair of the Executive Committee of the Utah State Campus Compact. He is a past member of the Zions Bank Central Utah Board of Advisors, and the Wells Fargo Southwest Utah Board of Advisors. He has been employed in many other capacities, including: Associate Director of Major Gifts ([[University of Utah]]), Consulting Historian ([[Harry S. Truman Library]]), Academic Advisor and Essayist ([[Skirball Cultural Center]]), Visiting Lecturer (Brigham Young University, University of Utah), and Research Assistant (U.S. Senate Labor Committee).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://suu.edu/general/president/bio.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514030412/http://www.suu.edu/general/president/bio.html|url-status=dead|title=SUU - About SUU: The Office of the President - Michael T.

Pulitzer Prize-winning historian and former Rhodes Professor of American history at the University of Oxford, Daniel Walker Howe, wrote this about ''College for the Commonwealth'': \"Benson and Boyd present a convincing case for why higher education needs and deserves public support. From practical examples they demonstrate how investment in higher education enables a society to rise to the opportunities presented by the future.\"\n\nBenson\u2019s next book is under contract with Johns Hopkins University Press with an anticipated release date of Fall 2022. Titled \u201cEvery Epoch Requires a Fresh Start\u201d: Daniel Coit Gilman and the Birth of the Modern American Research University, this work aims to recount the life of Johns Hopkins University\u2019s first president, Daniel Coit Gilman, and the establishment of America\u2019s first research university in Baltimore in 1876.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nBenson and his first wife, Celia Benson, divorced in 2004.

Priest is an applied mathematician and, along with the other members of his research group at St Andrews, is currently investigating a large number of solar phenomena, including [[sunspots]], coronal heating, wave propagation, [[magnetic reconnection]], magnetic instabilities, magnetic structures and [[helioseismology]]. This is done using mathematical modelling techniques and observational data from satellites such as SoHO, Yohkoh and TRACE, or ground-based observatories such as [[Kitt Peak]] and Big Bear. In 2000 he was the James Arthur Prize Lecturer at [[Harvard University]]. Professor Priest has received a number of academic awards for his research, including Hale Prize of the [[American Astronomical Society]] (2002), and was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in the same year. He is notable in the solar physics community as something of an evangelist for the importance of [[magnetic reconnection]] in driving many solar phenomena, and as an explanation of the solar [[coronal heating problem]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}.\n\nAs an applied mathematician, his research interests involve constructing mathematical models for the subtle and complex ways in which magnetic fields interact with plasmas in the atmosphere of the Sun and in more exotic cosmic objects. In particular, he is trying to understand how the corona of the Sun is heated to several million degrees and how magnetic energy is converted into other forms in solar flares.\n\nIn the area of science and religion, he considers himself aware of the importance of trying in small ways to encourage dialogue and understanding between Islam and Christianity and recently spoke on science and culture to 850 schoolchildren in [[Alexandria]], Egypt. He has also preached in St Andrews on the tensions between Christianity and science and spoke on \"Creativity in Science\" at a conference on Creativity and the Imagination.
