It is a two-door [[2+2 (car body style)|2+2]] [[Retractable hardtop|hard top convertible]]. When originally unveiled in 2008, the California was powered by a [[Front mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout|front-mid mounted, rear wheel drive]], [[naturally aspirated]] 4.3-litre [[V8 engine|V8]].<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\"/> In 2012 a lighter, slightly more powerful variant, the '''California 30''' was introduced. In 2014, Ferrari announced the second generation of the model, named '''California T''' powered by a new [[twin-turbo]] 3.9-litre V8. \n\nThe car revives the name used on the late-1950s [[Ferrari 250#250 GT California Spyder SWB|Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder]] and the 1960s [[Ferrari America#365 California|365 California]]. The modern California (2008) was originally introduced as an entry level model, however, it included many new design innovations from Ferrari. The original base price of the California was similar to the base price of the [[Ferrari F430| F430]], the company's V8 flagship sports car at the time of its introduction. In 2018, the California was succeeded by the [[Ferrari Portofino|Portofino]].\n\n=={{anchor|California}}Ferrari California (2008\u20132014)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Ferrari California\n| image        = Ferrari California - Flickr - Alexandre Pr\u00e9vot (13) (cropped).jpg\n| production   = 2008<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/1080626851/ferrari-california-begins-production-on-new-line |title=Ferrari California Begins Production on New Line |website=worldcarfans.com |date=2008-06-26 |accessdate=2009-07-17}}</ref>\u20132013\n|model_years   = 2009&ndash;2014\n| designer     = [[Pininfarina]] under [[Ken Okuyama]] \n| engine       = 4.3&nbsp;L ''[[Ferrari F136 engine#Ferrari|Ferrari F136 I]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 7-speed [[Dual clutch transmission|dual-clutch]]<br>6-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|2670|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\" />\n| length       = {{convert|4563|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2008/cars/ferrari/10/california_new_model/0710.html |title=New model: Ferrari California |website=italiaspeed.com |date=2008-10-08 |accessdate=2008-10-11}}</ref>\n| width        = {{convert|1902|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\" />\n| height       = {{convert|1308|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\" />\n| weight       = {{ubl\n  | {{convert|1735|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} (Europe)<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\" />\n  | {{convert|4123|lb|kg|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} (US)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.caranddriver.com/files/2009-ferrari-california-vs-2009-mercedes-benz-sl63-amgconvertible-vehicle-chart.pdf |title=2009 Ferrari California vs 2009 Mercedes Benz SL63 AMG Convertible Vehicle Chart |work=Car and Driver |location=US |access-date=2016-04-07}}</ref>\n  }}\n| sp = uk\n| predecessor  = \n| successor    = [[#California T|Ferrari California T]]\n}}\n{{Listen\n|filename     = Ferrari California (2009).ogg\n|title        = 2009 Ferrari California\n|type         = sound\n|style        = float:right\n}}\nThe California was launched at the October [[2008 Paris Motor Show]]. When introduced, the California represented a new fourth model range for Ferrari.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.topgear.com/car-news/california-dreaming|title=California dreaming |work=[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] |date=2008-05-13 |accessdate=2010-09-30}}</ref> The new model range (front-engine, eight cylinder grand touring sports car) joined the then current models: the mid-engine eight cylinder sports car, the front-engine twelve cylinder sports car, and the front-engine twelve cylinder grand touring car.\n\n===Design===\n[[File:Ferrari California - Flickr - Alexandre Pr\u00e9vot (21) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Ferrari California (Monaco)]]\n\nThe California represented a radical new design by [[Pininfarina|Pininfarina S.p.A.]] and was developed under the oversight of Ken Okuyama. The model was primarily intended to attract new Ferrari owners. The car's grand touring personality was emphasized with a slightly higher ride height compared to its more aggressive siblings. The chassis was designed and manufactured by Ferrari division [[Carrozzeria Scaglietti]]. Overall, it is considered a landmark car for Ferrari in that it represents a number of concepts being used for the first time in their road cars:<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\"/>\n\n* The first front engined Ferrari with a [[V8 engine|V8]]\n* The first to feature a 7-speed [[dual-clutch transmission]]\n* The first hard top convertible with a [[Retractable hardtop|folding metal roof]]\n* The first with [[multi-link suspension|multi-link rear suspension]]\n* The first with [[direct petrol injection]]\n\nThe engine displaces {{convert|4,297|cc|cuin|abbr=off}}, and used a [[gasoline direct injection]] system produced by [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]]. It generates a maximum power output of {{convert|338|kW|PS hp|abbr=on|0}} at 7,750 rpm; its maximum torque produced is {{convert|485|Nm|abbr=on|0}} at 5,000 rpm. The resulting {{convert|{{#expr:338/(4297/1000)round0}}|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} per litre of engine displacement is extremely high for a naturally aspirated engine, as other manufacturers have used [[forced induction]] to reach similar power levels.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inautonews.com/bosh-provides-gasoline-direct-injection-for-the-new-ferrari-california |title=Bosh provides gasoline direct injection for the new Ferrari California |first=Mircea |last=Serafim |website=inautonews.com |date=2008-11-28 |accessdate=2011-11-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006204525/http://www.inautonews.com/bosh-provides-gasoline-direct-injection-for-the-new-ferrari-california |archive-date=2011-10-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nThe engine makes use of a [[wet sump]] designed lubrication system. The [[body computer]] system was developed by [[Magneti Marelli]] Automotive Lighting.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nThe California's mid-front engine layout and rear gear box configuration create a 47% front to 53% rear weight distribution.\n\n====Traction Control====\nThe California is equipped with an exclusive Ferrari designed F1-Trac system. The system, originally introduced on the 599 GTB Fiorano, was updated for the model. The variable power distribution to the rear wheels allows greater stability and performance in roadway turns. The result is an average increase of 20% in acceleration when exiting curves (when compared to traditional traction control systems).\n\n====Configuration====\nThe [[Grand tourer|grand touring]] California was available with two passenger seating configurations. The first option ([[2+2 (car body style)|2+2]]), included two rear seats that are limited in space and arguably only capable of accommodating small child safety seats. The second option (2+), did away with the rear seats replacing them with a bench storage area. This storage area could accommodate slightly more luggage or personal effects than the seats and included matching leather luggage tie-down belts.\n\n====Stop/Start Technology====\nThe California was the first Ferrari road car to offer [[start-stop system|stop/start technology]]. What was an option package and called the HELE system (High Emotion / Low Emission) allowed the engine to shut off while at extended idle and start again immediately upon pushing the accelerator pedal. While this technology was not always well received by many of the Ferrari [[Tifosi]], it did allow for substantial tax savings upon sale in certain governmental jurisdictions. Later Ferrari models also offered this technology.\n\n===Performance===\nThe original California had a top speed of {{convert|310|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} and it could accelerate from {{convert|0-100|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} in under four seconds.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\" /> Although that model was {{convert|180|kg|lb|0}} heavier and {{convert|22|kW|PS hp|abbr=on}} less powerful than the mid-engined [[Ferrari F430|F430]], the California reached {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} in the same time as the F430 due to the dual-clutch transmission.\n\n===Aerodynamics===\nFerrari spent over 1,000 hours in the wind tunnel with a one-third-scale model of the vehicle perfecting its aerodynamics. With the top up, the California has greatly reduced wind resistance with a {{Cd|link=yes|long=yes|0.32}}.

Made entirely of aluminium, it retains many of the original features but generates a maximum power output of {{convert|360|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,750 rpm; its maximum torque produced is 505 Nm (372 ft-lbs) at 5,000 rpm. 75% of which is available at 2,250 rpm. The engine's sound - a feature that distinguishes every Ferrari - was engineered to enhance the vehicle's driving experience both with the top open and closed.\n\nThe California 30 can be differentiated from the base California by the VIN. In the 30 variant, the VIN's sixth digit (in North America) is \u201cT\u201d representing the F136IH engine. In the base model, the VIN's sixth digit (again in North America) is \u201cL\u201d representing the earlier generation F136IB engine.\n\n====Chassis====\nThe California 30 is the first Ferrari road car with a completely modular type chassis and was made entirely of new aluminum alloys. It is {{cvt|30|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} lighter than the standard California chassis with no loss in structural capacity providing an extremely high torsional rigidity value.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://auto.ferrari.com/en_EN/sports-cars-models/past-models/ferrari-california/|title=Ferrari California 30 (2012)|website=auto.ferrari.com|accessdate=11 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Handling Speciale package====\n[[File:2013 Ferrari California HS.jpg|thumb|2013 Ferrari California HS]]\nTo give the clients a more dynamic driving experience, an optional '''HS''' (Handling Speciale) package was developed as part of the update in 2012 (for the US 2013 model year).

It debuted in 2014 for the 2015 model year.\n\nFirst unveiled on the web on February 12, 2014, subsequently, the car debuted at the [[Geneva Motor Show#2014|Geneva Motor Show]] (March 6\u201316, 2014). The T in the moniker stands for Turbo, a technology Ferrari last used on the [[Ferrari F40|F40]] roadcar. The car utilizes a new {{convert|3855|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} [[twin-turbo]]charged [[V8 engine]] that produces {{convert|412|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,500 rpm and {{convert|755|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,750 rpm as well as a 7-speed dual clutch transmission with different gear ratios, a revised MagneRide adaptive suspension, as well as a new F1 Trac system. The car can accelerate from {{convert|0\u201362|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip|0}} in 3.6 seconds and attain a top speed of {{convert|196|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The car also features a new front fascia that was influenced by the F12, a revised rear section and a revised interior. The revised rear end replaced the two sets of two vertically stacked exhaust pipes with four horizontally aligned pipes. Another improvement to the car is the reduction of emission pollution by 15% compared to its naturally aspirated predecessor.

When originally unveiled in 2008, the California was powered by a [[Front mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout|front-mid mounted, rear wheel drive]], [[naturally aspirated]] 4.3-litre [[V8 engine|V8]].<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\"/> In 2012 a lighter, slightly more powerful variant, the '''California 30''' was introduced.

The modern California (2008) was originally introduced as an entry level model, however, it included many new design innovations from Ferrari.

The model was primarily intended to attract new Ferrari owners. The car's grand touring personality was emphasized with a slightly higher ride height compared to its more aggressive siblings. The chassis was designed and manufactured by Ferrari division [[Carrozzeria Scaglietti]]. Overall, it is considered a landmark car for Ferrari in that it represents a number of concepts being used for the first time in their road cars:<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\"/>\n\n* The first front engined Ferrari with a [[V8 engine|V8]]\n* The first to feature a 7-speed [[dual-clutch transmission]]\n* The first hard top convertible with a [[Retractable hardtop|folding metal roof]]\n* The first with [[multi-link suspension|multi-link rear suspension]]\n* The first with [[direct petrol injection]]\n\nThe engine displaces {{convert|4,297|cc|cuin|abbr=off}}, and used a [[gasoline direct injection]] system produced by [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]]. It generates a maximum power output of {{convert|338|kW|PS hp|abbr=on|0}} at 7,750 rpm; its maximum torque produced is {{convert|485|Nm|abbr=on|0}} at 5,000 rpm. The resulting {{convert|{{#expr:338/(4297/1000)round0}}|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} per litre of engine displacement is extremely high for a naturally aspirated engine, as other manufacturers have used [[forced induction]] to reach similar power levels.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inautonews.com/bosh-provides-gasoline-direct-injection-for-the-new-ferrari-california |title=Bosh provides gasoline direct injection for the new Ferrari California |first=Mircea |last=Serafim |website=inautonews.com |date=2008-11-28 |accessdate=2011-11-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006204525/http://www.inautonews.com/bosh-provides-gasoline-direct-injection-for-the-new-ferrari-california |archive-date=2011-10-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nThe engine makes use of a [[wet sump]] designed lubrication system. The [[body computer]] system was developed by [[Magneti Marelli]] Automotive Lighting.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nThe California's mid-front engine layout and rear gear box configuration create a 47% front to 53% rear weight distribution.\n\n====Traction Control====\nThe California is equipped with an exclusive Ferrari designed F1-Trac system. The system, originally introduced on the 599 GTB Fiorano, was updated for the model. The variable power distribution to the rear wheels allows greater stability and performance in roadway turns. The result is an average increase of 20% in acceleration when exiting curves (when compared to traditional traction control systems).\n\n====Configuration====\nThe [[Grand tourer|grand touring]] California was available with two passenger seating configurations. The first option ([[2+2 (car body style)|2+2]]), included two rear seats that are limited in space and arguably only capable of accommodating small child safety seats. The second option (2+), did away with the rear seats replacing them with a bench storage area. This storage area could accommodate slightly more luggage or personal effects than the seats and included matching leather luggage tie-down belts.\n\n====Stop/Start Technology====\nThe California was the first Ferrari road car to offer [[start-stop system|stop/start technology]]. What was an option package and called the HELE system (High Emotion / Low Emission) allowed the engine to shut off while at extended idle and start again immediately upon pushing the accelerator pedal. While this technology was not always well received by many of the Ferrari [[Tifosi]], it did allow for substantial tax savings upon sale in certain governmental jurisdictions. Later Ferrari models also offered this technology.\n\n===Performance===\nThe original California had a top speed of {{convert|310|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} and it could accelerate from {{convert|0-100|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} in under four seconds.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\" /> Although that model was {{convert|180|kg|lb|0}} heavier and {{convert|22|kW|PS hp|abbr=on}} less powerful than the mid-engined [[Ferrari F430|F430]], the California reached {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} in the same time as the F430 due to the dual-clutch transmission.\n\n===Aerodynamics===\nFerrari spent over 1,000 hours in the wind tunnel with a one-third-scale model of the vehicle perfecting its aerodynamics. With the top up, the California has greatly reduced wind resistance with a {{Cd|link=yes|long=yes|0.32}}.

It debuted in 2014 for the 2015 model year.\n\nFirst unveiled on the web on February 12, 2014, subsequently, the car debuted at the [[Geneva Motor Show#2014|Geneva Motor Show]] (March 6\u201316, 2014). The T in the moniker stands for Turbo, a technology Ferrari last used on the [[Ferrari F40|F40]] roadcar. The car utilizes a new {{convert|3855|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on}} [[twin-turbo]]charged [[V8 engine]] that produces {{convert|412|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} at 7,500 rpm and {{convert|755|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,750 rpm as well as a 7-speed dual clutch transmission with different gear ratios, a revised MagneRide adaptive suspension, as well as a new F1 Trac system. The car can accelerate from {{convert|0\u201362|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip|0}} in 3.6 seconds and attain a top speed of {{convert|196|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The car also features a new front fascia that was influenced by the F12, a revised rear section and a revised interior. The revised rear end replaced the two sets of two vertically stacked exhaust pipes with four horizontally aligned pipes. Another improvement to the car is the reduction of emission pollution by 15% compared to its naturally aspirated predecessor. The car also utilises small turbo chargers and a variable boost management system to reduce turbo lag.\n\nIt is also the first Ferrari road car debuting the new [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[CarPlay]] functionality into its built-in infotainment system \u2013 Apple confirmed at the launch of the Geneva Motor Show that [[Ferrari]], [[Mercedes-Benz]] and [[Volvo]] would be among the first car manufacturers to bring CarPlay compatible models to the market.<ref name=\"2014 brands start 1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/03/apple-carplay-ferrari-mercedes-benz-volvo|title=Apple CarPlay debuts with Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|first=Stuart|last=Dredge|date=2014-03-03|accessdate=2014-04-22}}</ref><ref name=\"ferrari carplay calT 1\">{{cite web |url=http://auto.ferrari.com/en_EN/news-events/news/ferrari-california-t-apple-carplay-equipped-ff-debut-tomorrow-geneva |title=The Ferrari California T and the Apple CarPlay equipped FF debut tomorrow at Geneva |work=Ferrari PR |publisher=[[Ferrari]] |date=2014-03-03 |accessdate=2014-05-31}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|California T Handling Speciale}}\n\n===California T Handling Speciale (2016\u20132017)===\nSimilarly to the previous generation, a Handling Speciale (HS) package was made available for the California T, providing sportier handling at the expense of a stiffer ride.

''Kotla'' literally means fortress or citadel. The pillar, also called obelisk or ''Lat'' is an [[Ashoka pillar|Ashoka Column]], attributed to Mauryan ruler Ashoka. The 13.1 metres high column, made of polished sandstone and dating from the 3rd century BC, was brought from Ambala in 14th century under orders of Feroz Shah. It was installed on a three-tiered arcaded pavilion near the congregational mosque, inside the Sultanate's fort. In centuries that followed, much of the structure and buildings near it were destroyed as subsequent rulers dismantled them and reused the [[spolia]] as building materials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/other/019xzz000007682u00011000.html|title=West Gate of Firoz Shah Kotla|publisher=British Library}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/other/019wdz000000709u00000000.html|title=Pillar of Firoz Shah at Delhi|publisher=British Library}}</ref>\n\nIn the pre-independence era, due to lack of auditoriums in the capital, most classical music performances were staged here or at [[Qutub complex]].

Architecturally it was built on a series of underground cells made of [[quartzite]] stone, covered with limestone. It is surrounded by a large courtyard with cloisters and a Prayer Hall. The Prayer Hall now in complete ruins, was once used by the Royal Ladies. The masjid and its architecture is an example of Tughluq architecture.\n\nThe entrance of Jami Masjid lies on the northern side. It is connected by a causeway to the pyramidal structure of the Ashokan Pillar. This mosque was visited by [[Timur|Sultan Timur]] in 1398 AD to say his prayers. He was spellbound by its beauty and constructed a mosque in [[Samarkand]] in [[Transoxiana|Mawarannahr]] imitating the design of this Masjid. This mosque is also known to be the place where [[Ghazi ud-Din Khan Feroze Jung III|Imad ul Mulk]], a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Prime Minister, got the Emperor Alamgir II murdered in 1759 AD.<ref name=\"delhiinformation.in\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.delhiinformation.in/tourism/monuments/ferozshahkotla.html|title=Feroz Shah Kotla Monuments \u2013 Jami Masjid Ashokan Pillars |website=www.DelhiInformation.in|access-date=2016-04-03}}</ref>\n\n==Topra Ashokan Pillar==\n{{see also|Topra_Kalan#Topra_Ashokan_Pillar|Ashokan_Edicts_in_Delhi#Delhi-Topra_pillar}}\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nAshokan Pillar at Feroz Shah Kotla, New Delhi.jpg|[[Pillars of Ashoka|Ashokan Pillar]] at Firoz Shah Kotla as it stands today.\nAshoka Pillar at Firoze Shah Kotla, Delhi.jpg|[[Ashoka Pillar]] at Feroze Shah Kotla, Delhi, 1861.\n</gallery>\nThe Ashokan Pillar that lies within Feroz Shah Kotla is perfectly placed towards the north of Jama Masjid [Mosque]. The Pillar was first erected by [[Ashoka|King Ashoka]] between 273 and 236 BC in [[Topra Kalan]], [[Yamunanagar district]], [[Haryana]].\n\nOf note, there is another Ashokan Pillar, that is seen installed near the Hindu Rao Hospital, also erected by [[Ashoka|King Ashoka]] in [[Meerut]]. This pillar, however, was unfortunately broken into five pieces after it was damaged during an explosion. The pillar was neglected for a century up till 1838, when after the [[Revolt of 1857]] [[Raja Hindu Rao]] took charge to transfer the Ashokan Pillar's broken pieces to Kolkata's [[The Asiatic Society|Asiatic Society]]. Within a year, the structure was put together and re-established.\n\nBoth the Ashokan Pillars were carefully wrapped with cotton silk and were kept on a bed of reed made of raw silk. These were hence transported on a massive carriage attached with 42 wheels and drawn meticulously by 200 men from their original places to Delhi by [[Firuz Shah Tughlaq|Feroz Shah Tughlaq]] to avoid any damage during the journey. Upon reaching Delhi, they were then transported on huge boats to their final destination, one within Feroz Shah Kotla and the other on the ridge near [[University of Delhi|Delhi University]] and Bara Hindu Rao Hospital.<ref name=\"delhiinformation.in\"/>\n\n==Script on stone==\n[[File:Ashoka pillar delhi1.png|thumb|310x310px|The inscription on Ashoka pillar at Firoz Shah Kotla.]]\nThe Sultanate had wanted to break and reuse the Ashokan pillar for a minaret. Firoz Shah Tuhglaq, however decided to erect it near the mosque instead.

The inscription was successfully translated in 1837 by [[James Prinsep]].<ref name=jprinsep/> This and other ancient ''lats'' (pillars, obelisk) have earned Firoz Shah Tughlaq and [[Delhi Sultanate]] some fame for its architectural patronage.<ref>William Jeffrey McKibben, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4629462 \"The Monumental Pillars of F\u012br\u016bz Sh\u0101h Tughluq\"], ''Ars Orientalis'', Vol. 24, (1994), pp. 105\u2013118</ref>\n\nOther than the Ashokan Pillar, the Fort complex also houses the Jami Masjid (Mosque), a ''Baoli'' and a large garden complex.\n\n==History==\nFeroz Shah Tughlaq (r. 1351\u20131388), the [[Sultan of Delhi]], established the fortified city of Firuzabad<ref name=\"sen2\">{{Cite book |last=Sen |first=Sailendra |title=A Textbook of Medieval Indian History |publisher=Primus Books |year=2013 |isbn=978-9-38060-734-4 |pages=98}}</ref> in 1354, as the new capital of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], and included in it the site of the present Feroz Shah Kotla. ''Kotla'' literally means fortress or citadel. The pillar, also called obelisk or ''Lat'' is an [[Ashoka pillar|Ashoka Column]], attributed to Mauryan ruler Ashoka. The 13.1 metres high column, made of polished sandstone and dating from the 3rd century BC, was brought from Ambala in 14th century under orders of Feroz Shah. It was installed on a three-tiered arcaded pavilion near the congregational mosque, inside the Sultanate's fort. In centuries that followed, much of the structure and buildings near it were destroyed as subsequent rulers dismantled them and reused the [[spolia]] as building materials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/other/019xzz000007682u00011000.html|title=West Gate of Firoz Shah Kotla|publisher=British Library}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/other/019wdz000000709u00000000.html|title=Pillar of Firoz Shah at Delhi|publisher=British Library}}</ref>\n\nIn the pre-independence era, due to lack of auditoriums in the capital, most classical music performances were staged here or at [[Qutub complex]].

Architecturally it was built on a series of underground cells made of [[quartzite]] stone, covered with limestone. It is surrounded by a large courtyard with cloisters and a Prayer Hall. The Prayer Hall now in complete ruins, was once used by the Royal Ladies. The masjid and its architecture is an example of Tughluq architecture.\n\nThe entrance of Jami Masjid lies on the northern side. It is connected by a causeway to the pyramidal structure of the Ashokan Pillar. This mosque was visited by [[Timur|Sultan Timur]] in 1398 AD to say his prayers. He was spellbound by its beauty and constructed a mosque in [[Samarkand]] in [[Transoxiana|Mawarannahr]] imitating the design of this Masjid. This mosque is also known to be the place where [[Ghazi ud-Din Khan Feroze Jung III|Imad ul Mulk]], a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Prime Minister, got the Emperor Alamgir II murdered in 1759 AD.<ref name=\"delhiinformation.in\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.delhiinformation.in/tourism/monuments/ferozshahkotla.html|title=Feroz Shah Kotla Monuments \u2013 Jami Masjid Ashokan Pillars |website=www.DelhiInformation.in|access-date=2016-04-03}}</ref>\n\n==Topra Ashokan Pillar==\n{{see also|Topra_Kalan#Topra_Ashokan_Pillar|Ashokan_Edicts_in_Delhi#Delhi-Topra_pillar}}\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nAshokan Pillar at Feroz Shah Kotla, New Delhi.jpg|[[Pillars of Ashoka|Ashokan Pillar]] at Firoz Shah Kotla as it stands today.\nAshoka Pillar at Firoze Shah Kotla, Delhi.jpg|[[Ashoka Pillar]] at Feroze Shah Kotla, Delhi, 1861.\n</gallery>\nThe Ashokan Pillar that lies within Feroz Shah Kotla is perfectly placed towards the north of Jama Masjid [Mosque]. The Pillar was first erected by [[Ashoka|King Ashoka]] between 273 and 236 BC in [[Topra Kalan]], [[Yamunanagar district]], [[Haryana]].\n\nOf note, there is another Ashokan Pillar, that is seen installed near the Hindu Rao Hospital, also erected by [[Ashoka|King Ashoka]] in [[Meerut]]. This pillar, however, was unfortunately broken into five pieces after it was damaged during an explosion. The pillar was neglected for a century up till 1838, when after the [[Revolt of 1857]] [[Raja Hindu Rao]] took charge to transfer the Ashokan Pillar's broken pieces to Kolkata's [[The Asiatic Society|Asiatic Society]]. Within a year, the structure was put together and re-established.\n\nBoth the Ashokan Pillars were carefully wrapped with cotton silk and were kept on a bed of reed made of raw silk. These were hence transported on a massive carriage attached with 42 wheels and drawn meticulously by 200 men from their original places to Delhi by [[Firuz Shah Tughlaq|Feroz Shah Tughlaq]] to avoid any damage during the journey. Upon reaching Delhi, they were then transported on huge boats to their final destination, one within Feroz Shah Kotla and the other on the ridge near [[University of Delhi|Delhi University]] and Bara Hindu Rao Hospital.<ref name=\"delhiinformation.in\"/>\n\n==Script on stone==\n[[File:Ashoka pillar delhi1.png|thumb|310x310px|The inscription on Ashoka pillar at Firoz Shah Kotla.]]\nThe Sultanate had wanted to break and reuse the Ashokan pillar for a minaret. Firoz Shah Tuhglaq, however decided to erect it near the mosque instead.

{"title_page": "Feed forward (control)", "text_new": "{{main|Feedforward}}\n\nA '''feed forward''', sometimes written '''feedforward''', is an element or pathway within a [[control system]] that passes a controlling signal from a source in its external environment to a load elsewhere in its external environment. This is often a command signal from an external operator.\n\nA control system which has only feed-forward behavior responds to its control signal in a pre-defined way without responding to how the load reacts; it is in contrast with a system that also has [[feedback]], which adjusts the output to take account of how it affects the load, and how the load itself may vary unpredictably; the load is considered to belong to the external environment of the system.\n\nIn a feed-forward system, the control variable adjustment is not error-based. Instead it is based on knowledge about the process in the form of a mathematical model of the process and knowledge about or measurements of the process disturbances.<ref>{{cite book|last=Haugen|first=F.|title=Basic Dynamics and Control|year=2009|isbn=978-82-91748-13-9}}</ref>\n\nSome prerequisites are needed for control scheme to be reliable by pure feed-forward without feedback: the external command or controlling signal must be available, and the effect of the output of the system on the load should be known (that usually means that the load must be predictably unchanging with time). Sometimes pure feed-forward control without feedback is called 'ballistic', because once a control signal has been sent, it cannot be further adjusted; any corrective adjustment must be by way of a new control signal. In contrast, 'cruise control' adjusts the output in response to the load that it encounters, by a feedback mechanism.\n\nThese systems could relate to [[control theory]], [[physiology]], or [[computing]].\n\n== Overview ==\nWith feed-forward or feedforward control, the disturbances are measured and accounted for before they have time to affect the system. In the house example, a feed-forward system may measure the fact that the door is opened and automatically turn on the heater before the house can get too cold. The difficulty with feed-forward control is that the effects of the disturbances on the system must be accurately predicted, and there must not be any unmeasured disturbances. For instance, if a window was opened that was not being measured, the feed-forward-controlled thermostat might let the house cool down.\n\nThe term has specific meaning within the field of CPU-based [[automatic control]]. The discipline of \u201cfeedforward control\u201d as it relates to modern, CPU based automatic controls is widely discussed, but is seldom practiced due to the difficulty and expense of developing or providing for the [[mathematical model]] required to facilitate this type of control. [[Open-loop controller|Open-loop control]] and [[Feedback controller|feedback control]], often based on canned [[PID controller|PID control]] algorithms, are much more widely used.<ref name=\"ISA1\">{{cite web|title=Fundamentals of Motion Control|url=http://www.isa.org/Content/ContentGroups/Motion_Control2/Departments1/Motion_Fundamentals/200227/20020421.pdf|publisher=ISA|access-date=23 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927022329/http://www.isa.org/Content/ContentGroups/Motion_Control2/Departments1/Motion_Fundamentals/200227/20020421.pdf|archive-date=27 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|authors=Book, W.J. and Cetinkunt, S.|title=Optimum Control of Flexible Robot Arms OR Fixed Paths|journal=IEEE Conference on Decision and Control|date=December 1985}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|authors=Oosting, K.W. and Dickerson, S.L.|title=Control of a Lightweight Robot Arm|journal=IEEE International Conference on Industrial Automation|year=1986}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Control Systems.png|thumb|300px|The Three types of Control System\n(a) Open Loop\n(b) Feed-forward\n(c) Feedback (Closed Loop)\n\nBased on Hopgood (2002)]]\n\nThere are three types of control systems: open loop, feed-forward, and feedback. An example of a pure open loop control system is manual non-power-assisted steering of a motor car; the steering system does not have access to an auxiliary power source and does not respond to varying resistance to turning of the direction wheels; the driver must make that response without help from the steering system. In comparison, [[power steering]] has access to a controlled auxiliary power source, which depends on the engine speed. When the steering wheel is turned, a valve is opened which allows fluid under pressure to turn the driving wheels. A sensor monitors that pressure so that the valve only opens enough to cause the correct pressure to reach the wheel turning mechanism.  This is feed-forward control where the output of the system, the change in direction of travel of the vehicle, plays no part in the system. See [[Model predictive control]].\n\nIf you include the driver in the system, then they do provide a feedback path by observing the direction of travel and compensating for errors by turning the steering wheel. In that case you have a feedback system, and the block labeled \"System\" in Figure(c) is a feed-forward system.\n\nIn other words, systems of different types can be nested, and the overall system regarded as a [[black-box]].\n\nFeedforward control is distinctly different from open loop control and [[teleoperator]] systems. Feedforward control requires a mathematical model of the plant (process and/or machine being controlled) and the plant's relationship to any inputs or feedback the system might receive. Neither open loop control nor teleoperator systems require the sophistication of a mathematical model of the [[physical system]] or plant being controlled. Control based on operator input without integral processing and interpretation through a mathematical model of the system is a teleoperator system and is not considered feedforward control.<ref name=onote1/><ref name=onote25/>\n\n== History ==\nHistorically, the use of the term \u201cfeedforward\u201d is found in works by Harold S. Black in US patent 1686792 (invented 17th March 1923) and [[Donald MacCrimmon MacKay|D. M. MacKay]] as early as 1956. While MacKay's work is in the field of biological control theory, he speaks only of feedforward systems. MacKay does not mention \u201cFeedforward Control\u201d or allude to the discipline of \u201cFeedforward Controls.\u201d MacKay and other early writers who use the term \u201cfeedforward\u201d are generally writing about theories of how human or animal brains work.<ref name=onote37/>. Black also has US patent 2102671 invented 2 August 1927 on the technique of feedback applied to electronic systems.  \n\nThe discipline of \u201cfeedforward controls\u201d was largely developed by professors and graduate students at [[Georgia Tech]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]] and [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Mellon]]. Feedforward is not typically hyphenated in scholarly publications. Meckl and Seering of MIT and Book and Dickerson of Georgia Tech began the development of the concepts of Feedforward Control in the mid 1970s. The discipline of Feedforward Controls was well defined in many scholarly papers, articles and books by the late 1980s.<ref name=onote1/><ref name=onote2>Alberts, T.E., Augmenting the Control of A Flexible Manipulator with Passive Mechanical Damping, PhD.

Control accuracy can often be improved by as much as an [[order of magnitude]] if the mathematical model is of sufficient quality and implementation of the feedforward control law is well thought out. [[Energy consumption]] by the feedforward control system and its driver is typically substantially lower than with other controls. Stability is enhanced such that the controlled device can be built of lower cost, lighter weight, springier materials while still being highly accurate and able to operate at high speeds. Other benefits of feedforward control include reduced wear and tear on equipment, lower maintenance costs, higher reliability and a substantial reduction in [[hysteresis]].  Feedforward control is often combined with feedback control to optimize performance.<ref name=onote1>Oosting, K.W., Simulation of Control Strategies for a Two Degree-of-Freedom Lightweight Flexible Robotic Arm, Thesis, Georgia Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, 1987.</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Feedforward control|url=http://www.bgu.ac.il/chem_eng/pages/Courses/oren%20courses/Chapter_9.pdf|publisher=Ben Gurion University|accessdate=23 February 2013}}</ref><ref name=onote3>Hastings, G.G., Controlling Flexible Manipulators, An Experimental Investigation, Ph.D. Dissertation, Dept. of Mech.

In the case of control for a lightweight, flexible [[robotic arm]], this could be as simple as compensating between when the robot arm is carrying a [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]] and when it is not. The target joint angles are adjusted to place the payload in the desired position based on knowing the deflections in the arm from the mathematical model's interpretation of the disturbance caused by the payload. Systems that plan actions and then pass the plan to a different system for execution do not satisfy the above definition of feedforward control. Unless the system includes a means to detect a disturbance or receive an input and process that input through the mathematical model to determine the required modification to the control action, it is not true feedforward control.<ref name=onote38/><ref name=onote13>Book, W.J., Modeling, Design and Control of Flexible Manipulator Arms, PhD.

In contrast, a [[closed system (control theory)|closed system]] uses on a feedback loop to control the operation of the system.  In an open system, the output of the system is not fed back into the input to the system for control or operation.\n\n== Applications ==\n\n===Physiological feed-forward system===\nIn [[physiology]], feed-forward control is exemplified by the normal anticipatory regulation of heartbeat in advance of actual physical exertion by the central [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic network]].  Feed-forward control can be likened to learned anticipatory responses to known cues ([[predictive coding]]). Feedback regulation of the heartbeat provides further adaptiveness to the running eventualities of physical exertion. Feedforward systems are also found in biological control of other variables by many regions of animals [[brain]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Feedback Feedforward control|url=http://psychology.jrank.org/pages/1155/feedback-feedforward.html|publisher=Psychology Encyclopedia|access-date=24 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005112218/http://psychology.jrank.org/pages/1155/feedback-feedforward.html|archive-date=5 October 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nEven in the case of biological feedforward systems, such as in the [[human brain]], knowledge or a [[mental model]] of the plant (body) can be considered to be mathematical as the model is characterized by limits, rhythms, mechanics and patterns.<ref name=onote37>MacKay, D.

(1969): \"Seeking mathematical models of skilled actions\". In: H. C. Muffley/D. Bootzin (Eds.), Biomechanics, Plenum, pp. 149\u2013180</ref>\n\nA pure feed-forward system is different from a [[homeostatic]] control system, which has the function of keeping the body's internal environment 'steady' or in a 'prolonged steady state of readiness.' A homeostatic control system relies mainly on feedback (especially negative), in addition to the feedforward elements of the system.\n\n===Gene regulation and feed-forward===\nThe cross regulation of genes can be represented by a graph, where genes are the nodes and one node is linked to another if the former is a [[transcription factor]] for the latter. A motif which predominantly appears in all known networks ([[E. coli]], [[Yeast]],...) is A activates B, A and B activate C. This motif has been shown to be a feed forward system, detecting non-temporary change of environment. This feed forward control theme is commonly observed in [[Hematopoietic stem cell|hematopoietic cell lineage]] development, where irreversible commitments are made.\n\n===Feed-forward systems in computing===\n{{main|Perceptron}}\n\nIn [[computing]], feed-forward normally refers to a [[perceptron]] network in which the outputs from all [[neuron]]s go to following but not preceding [[layer (abstraction)|layers]], so there are no [[feedback loop]]s.  The connections are set up during a training phase, which in effect is when the system is a feedback system.\n\n===Long distance telephony===\nIn the early 1970s, intercity coaxial transmission systems, including [[L-carrier]], used feed-forward amplifiers to diminish linear distortion.  This more complex method allowed wider [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] than earlier [[feedback]] systems.  [[Optical fiber]], however, made such systems obsolete before many were built.\n\n===Automation and machine control===\nFeedforward control is a discipline within the field of automatic controls used in automation.\n\n===Parallel feed-forward compensation with derivative (PFCD)===\nThe method is rather a new technique that changes the phase of an open-loop transfer function of a [[Minimum phase#Non-minimum phase|non-minimum phase]] system into [[minimum phase]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www-scf.usc.edu/~noury/images/IDETC97572.pdf|title=Tip Position Control of Single Flexible Links via Parallel Feedforward Compensation|last=Noury|first=K.|date=2019|website=ASME|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Black box]]\n* [[Smith predictor]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{div col}}\n* S.

This is often a command signal from an external operator.\n\nA control system which has only feed-forward behavior responds to its control signal in a pre-defined way without responding to how the load reacts; it is in contrast with a system that also has [[feedback]], which adjusts the output to take account of how it affects the load, and how the load itself may vary unpredictably; the load is considered to belong to the external environment of the system.\n\nIn a feed-forward system, the control variable adjustment is not error-based. Instead it is based on knowledge about the process in the form of a mathematical model of the process and knowledge about or measurements of the process disturbances.<ref>{{cite book|last=Haugen|first=F.|title=Basic Dynamics and Control|year=2009|isbn=978-82-91748-13-9}}</ref>\n\nSome prerequisites are needed for control scheme to be reliable by pure feed-forward without feedback: the external command or controlling signal must be available, and the effect of the output of the system on the load should be known (that usually means that the load must be predictably unchanging with time). Sometimes pure feed-forward control without feedback is called 'ballistic', because once a control signal has been sent, it cannot be further adjusted; any corrective adjustment must be by way of a new control signal. In contrast, 'cruise control' adjusts the output in response to the load that it encounters, by a feedback mechanism.\n\nThese systems could relate to [[control theory]], [[physiology]], or [[computing]].\n\n== Overview ==\nWith feed-forward or feedforward control, the disturbances are measured and accounted for before they have time to affect the system. In the house example, a feed-forward system may measure the fact that the door is opened and automatically turn on the heater before the house can get too cold. The difficulty with feed-forward control is that the effects of the disturbances on the system must be accurately predicted, and there must not be any unmeasured disturbances. For instance, if a window was opened that was not being measured, the feed-forward-controlled thermostat might let the house cool down.\n\nThe term has specific meaning within the field of CPU-based [[automatic control]]. The discipline of \u201cfeedforward control\u201d as it relates to modern, CPU based automatic controls is widely discussed, but is seldom practiced due to the difficulty and expense of developing or providing for the [[mathematical model]] required to facilitate this type of control. [[Open-loop controller|Open-loop control]] and [[Feedback controller|feedback control]], often based on canned [[PID controller|PID control]] algorithms, are much more widely used.<ref name=\"ISA1\">{{cite web|title=Fundamentals of Motion Control|url=http://www.isa.org/Content/ContentGroups/Motion_Control2/Departments1/Motion_Fundamentals/200227/20020421.pdf|publisher=ISA|access-date=23 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927022329/http://www.isa.org/Content/ContentGroups/Motion_Control2/Departments1/Motion_Fundamentals/200227/20020421.pdf|archive-date=27 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|authors=Book, W.J. and Cetinkunt, S.|title=Optimum Control of Flexible Robot Arms OR Fixed Paths|journal=IEEE Conference on Decision and Control|date=December 1985}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|authors=Oosting, K.W. and Dickerson, S.L.|title=Control of a Lightweight Robot Arm|journal=IEEE International Conference on Industrial Automation|year=1986}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Control Systems.png|thumb|300px|The Three types of Control System\n(a) Open Loop\n(b) Feed-forward\n(c) Feedback (Closed Loop)\n\nBased on Hopgood (2002)]]\n\nThere are three types of control systems: open loop, feed-forward, and feedback. An example of a pure open loop control system is manual non-power-assisted steering of a motor car; the steering system does not have access to an auxiliary power source and does not respond to varying resistance to turning of the direction wheels; the driver must make that response without help from the steering system. In comparison, [[power steering]] has access to a controlled auxiliary power source, which depends on the engine speed. When the steering wheel is turned, a valve is opened which allows fluid under pressure to turn the driving wheels. A sensor monitors that pressure so that the valve only opens enough to cause the correct pressure to reach the wheel turning mechanism.  This is feed-forward control where the output of the system, the change in direction of travel of the vehicle, plays no part in the system. See [[Model predictive control]].\n\nIf you include the driver in the system, then they do provide a feedback path by observing the direction of travel and compensating for errors by turning the steering wheel. In that case you have a feedback system, and the block labeled \"System\" in Figure(c) is a feed-forward system.\n\nIn other words, systems of different types can be nested, and the overall system regarded as a [[black-box]].\n\nFeedforward control is distinctly different from open loop control and [[teleoperator]] systems. Feedforward control requires a mathematical model of the plant (process and/or machine being controlled) and the plant's relationship to any inputs or feedback the system might receive. Neither open loop control nor teleoperator systems require the sophistication of a mathematical model of the [[physical system]] or plant being controlled. Control based on operator input without integral processing and interpretation through a mathematical model of the system is a teleoperator system and is not considered feedforward control.<ref name=onote1/><ref name=onote25/>\n\n== History ==\nHistorically, the use of the term \u201cfeedforward\u201d is found in works by Harold S. Black in US patent 1686792 (invented 17th March 1923) and [[Donald MacCrimmon MacKay|D. M. MacKay]] as early as 1956. While MacKay's work is in the field of biological control theory, he speaks only of feedforward systems. MacKay does not mention \u201cFeedforward Control\u201d or allude to the discipline of \u201cFeedforward Controls.\u201d MacKay and other early writers who use the term \u201cfeedforward\u201d are generally writing about theories of how human or animal brains work.<ref name=onote37/>. Black also has US patent 2102671 invented 2 August 1927 on the technique of feedback applied to electronic systems.  \n\nThe discipline of \u201cfeedforward controls\u201d was largely developed by professors and graduate students at [[Georgia Tech]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[Stanford University|Stanford]] and [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Mellon]]. Feedforward is not typically hyphenated in scholarly publications. Meckl and Seering of MIT and Book and Dickerson of Georgia Tech began the development of the concepts of Feedforward Control in the mid 1970s. The discipline of Feedforward Controls was well defined in many scholarly papers, articles and books by the late 1980s.<ref name=onote1/><ref name=onote2>Alberts, T.E., Augmenting the Control of A Flexible Manipulator with Passive Mechanical Damping, PhD.

Control accuracy can often be improved by as much as an [[order of magnitude]] if the mathematical model is of sufficient quality and implementation of the feedforward control law is well thought out. [[Energy consumption]] by the feedforward control system and its driver is typically substantially lower than with other controls. Stability is enhanced such that the controlled device can be built of lower cost, lighter weight, springier materials while still being highly accurate and able to operate at high speeds. Other benefits of feedforward control include reduced wear and tear on equipment, lower maintenance costs, higher reliability and a substantial reduction in [[hysteresis]].  Feedforward control is often combined with feedback control to optimize performance.<ref name=onote1>Oosting, K.W., Simulation of Control Strategies for a Two Degree-of-Freedom Lightweight Flexible Robotic Arm, Thesis, Georgia Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, 1987.</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Feedforward control|url=http://www.bgu.ac.il/chem_eng/pages/Courses/oren%20courses/Chapter_9.pdf|publisher=Ben Gurion University|accessdate=23 February 2013}}</ref><ref name=onote3>Hastings, G.G., Controlling Flexible Manipulators, An Experimental Investigation, Ph.D. Dissertation, Dept. of Mech.

In the case of control for a lightweight, flexible [[robotic arm]], this could be as simple as compensating between when the robot arm is carrying a [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]] and when it is not. The target joint angles are adjusted to place the payload in the desired position based on knowing the deflections in the arm from the mathematical model's interpretation of the disturbance caused by the payload. Systems that plan actions and then pass the plan to a different system for execution do not satisfy the above definition of feedforward control. Unless the system includes a means to detect a disturbance or receive an input and process that input through the mathematical model to determine the required modification to the control action, it is not true feedforward control.<ref name=onote38/><ref name=onote13>Book, W.J., Modeling, Design and Control of Flexible Manipulator Arms, PhD.

In contrast, a [[closed system (control theory)|closed system]] uses on a feedback loop to control the operation of the system.  In an open system, the output of the system is not fed back into the input to the system for control or operation.\n\n== Applications ==\n\n===Physiological feed-forward system===\nIn [[physiology]], feed-forward control is exemplified by the normal anticipatory regulation of heartbeat in advance of actual physical exertion by the central [[autonomic nervous system|autonomic network]].  Feed-forward control can be likened to learned anticipatory responses to known cues ([[predictive coding]]). Feedback regulation of the heartbeat provides further adaptiveness to the running eventualities of physical exertion. Feedforward systems are also found in biological control of other variables by many regions of animals [[brain]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Feedback Feedforward control|url=http://psychology.jrank.org/pages/1155/feedback-feedforward.html|publisher=Psychology Encyclopedia|access-date=24 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005112218/http://psychology.jrank.org/pages/1155/feedback-feedforward.html|archive-date=5 October 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nEven in the case of biological feedforward systems, such as in the [[human brain]], knowledge or a [[mental model]] of the plant (body) can be considered to be mathematical as the model is characterized by limits, rhythms, mechanics and patterns.<ref name=onote37>MacKay, D. M. (1966): \"Cerebral organization and the conscious control of action\". In: J. C. Eccles (Ed.), Brain and conscious experience, Springer, pp. 422\u2013440</ref><ref name=onote38>Greene, P. H. (1969): \"Seeking mathematical models of skilled actions\". In: H. C. Muffley/D. Bootzin (Eds.), Biomechanics, Plenum, pp. 149\u2013180</ref>\n\nA pure feed-forward system is different from a [[homeostatic]] control system, which has the function of keeping the body's internal environment 'steady' or in a 'prolonged steady state of readiness.' A homeostatic control system relies mainly on feedback (especially negative), in addition to the feedforward elements of the system.\n\n===Gene regulation and feed-forward===\nThe cross regulation of genes can be represented by a graph, where genes are the nodes and one node is linked to another if the former is a [[transcription factor]] for the latter. A motif which predominantly appears in all known networks ([[E. coli]], [[Yeast]],...) is A activates B, A and B activate C. This motif has been shown to be a feed forward system, detecting non-temporary change of environment. This feed forward control theme is commonly observed in [[Hematopoietic stem cell|hematopoietic cell lineage]] development, where irreversible commitments are made.\n\n===Feed-forward systems in computing===\n{{main|Perceptron}}\n\nIn [[computing]], feed-forward normally refers to a [[perceptron]] network in which the outputs from all [[neuron]]s go to following but not preceding [[layer (abstraction)|layers]], so there are no [[feedback loop]]s.  The connections are set up during a training phase, which in effect is when the system is a feedback system.\n\n===Long distance telephony===\nIn the early 1970s, intercity coaxial transmission systems, including [[L-carrier]], used feed-forward amplifiers to diminish linear distortion.  This more complex method allowed wider [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] than earlier [[feedback]] systems.  [[Optical fiber]], however, made such systems obsolete before many were built.\n\n===Automation and machine control===\nFeedforward control is a discipline within the field of automatic controls used in automation.\n\n===Parallel feed-forward compensation with derivative (PFCD)===\nThe method is rather a new technique that changes the phase of an open-loop transfer function of a [[Minimum phase#Non-minimum phase|non-minimum phase]] system into [[minimum phase]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www-scf.usc.edu/~noury/images/IDETC97572.pdf|title=Tip Position Control of Single Flexible Links via Parallel Feedforward Compensation|last=Noury|first=K.|date=2019|website=ASME|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Black box]]\n* [[Smith predictor]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{div col}}\n* S.

When new neighbors, the Radfords, move in next door, they become suspicious of Cassie and her daughter.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Main===\n*[[Catherine Bell (actress)|Catherine Bell]] as Cassandra \"Cassie\" Nightingale: She is the owner of a shop called Bell, Book & Candle and runs a [[bed and breakfast]] at Grey House. In the first season, Cassie develops a friendship with Middleton's newest resident and neighbor, Sam Radford, and tries to move on from the loss of Jake with her long time friend, Ryan Elliot. However, both Cassie and Sam slowly begin to realize their romantic feelings for each other. Eventually, Cassie and Sam become a couple and by the end of the third season, they are engaged. Throughout the fourth season, Cassie and Sam are happily engaged and begin planning their wedding and finally become husband and wife in the beginning of season five.\n*[[Bailee Madison]] as Grace Russell (seasons 1\u20135): Cassie's teenage daughter and half-sister of Brandon and Lori who has her own \"intuitive charm\". Grace meets Nick Radford, a new resident that has arrived in Middleton. She initially tries to ignore him but gradually becomes his friend, even though, occasionally, he gets her into trouble. In the second season, she tries to gain her driver's license and has Sam teach her, while she is struggling to move on from the loss of her father Jake. In the third season, Grace briefly questions her true feelings for Nick, but later forms a relationship with his friend, Noah while she is struggling to accept the newfound romantic relationship between Cassie and Sam. In the fourth season, Grace begins to mend her friendship with Nick and begins to think more about her future. In the fifth season, Grace is nearing the end of her final year of high school and is getting ready for graduation and college. Grace later begins internship at the Mayor's office and begins a romantic relationship with Luke, her fellow intern after she and Noah end their relationship, unable to handle the long distance.\n*[[James Denton]] as Dr. Sam Radford: Cassie's handsome neighbor and the town's new doctor. He is fairly wealthy from his experiences as a New York trauma surgeon, owner of his own private practice, on multiple hospital boards, and other activities. He has a hard time adjusting to Middleton in the beginning, but slowly opens up to the town while also beginning a close friendship with Cassie. In the first season, he dates Stephanie, but they eventually break up as he slowly begins to realize his true feelings towards Cassie. Sam admits his feelings at the start of the second season and begins to pursue Cassie, but faces trouble due to Linda's interference and the arrival of Cassie's old friend John. In the beginning of the third season, Sam and Cassie become  a couple and later get engaged after he proposes in the third-season finale. Eventually, after being engaged throughout the fourth season, Sam and Cassie finally get married in the beginning of season five.\n*Rhys Matthew Bond as Nick Radford: Sam's troublesome son. Since arriving in Middleton, he refuses to accept his new home and constantly wishes to go back to New York. In the first season, he repeatedly gets into trouble such as stealing a school statue or lying to his father. Eventually, Nick slowly begins to realize his mistakes and begins to form a friendship with Grace. In the second season, he becomes a nicer person and doesn't get into any trouble anymore, but still faces some problems within his family. In the third season, Nick begins a romantic relationship with Grace's friend, Courtney until in the season finale, he reveals his decision to break up, resulting in a falling out between him and Grace. In the fourth season, despite Nick and Grace refusing to forgive each other, they begin to mend their friendship as they prepare to become step-siblings. In the fifth season, Nick is getting ready for college and begins to think about his future, realizing his true passion for designing games.\n*[[Sarah Power]] as Abigail Pershing: Cassie's cousin. She has her own magical touch similar to Cassie, but uses it in her own way. Abigail is known to cause a bit of trouble to others, but they eventually help in the least expected way. Abigail originally worked for an Ad Agency in New York, but decided to leave to be closer to the family. Upon returning to Middleton, Abigail causes some problems such as helping Grace rebel and interfering in Stephanie and Sam's relationship. She begins working for Stephanie in the bistro, but in the beginning of the second season, she opens her own flower shop. In the third season, Abigail becomes jealous of Cassie and tries to learn of her own purpose of what she can bring to the community of Middleton. In the fourth season finale, Abigail becomes the new Mayor of Middleton after Martha is forced to step down. In season five, Abigail is struggling with her newfound duties and develops a rivalry and later a romantic relationship with Donovan Davenport, the Mayor of Blairsville. Abigail later happily resigns after Martha regains her position and continues her relationship with Donovan, but they face adversity from his disapproving mother and a potential curse that could tear them apart. (season 2-present, recurring season 1)\n*[[Catherine Disher]] as Martha Tinsdale: The mayor of Middleton. Since the [[The Good Witch's Wonder|previous ''Good Witch'' movie]], Martha has been the mayor of Middleton and is always making certain that parties and festivals are going exactly according to plan and turn out perfectly. Martha's goal is to help Middleton grow and not to be overshadowed by the rival town of Blairsville. Despite their rocky start, Martha is a close and good friend with Cassie, always appreciating everything Cassie has done for the town. In the fourth-season finale, Martha is forced to step down as mayor when it's revealed that she technically lives in Blairsville, much to her dismay. In season five, Martha tries to find her new calling and later becomes a television talk show host but eventually resumes her place as mayor of Middleton.\n*Kylee Evans as Stephanie Borden: the owner of a local bistro and a close friend of Cassie. She doesn't like being single and is attracted to new men that arrive in town. In the first season, she is smitten with the new doctor, Sam and starts to pursue him. They briefly form a relationship, but eventually break up due to their differences and the slight interference of Abigail. In the second season, Stephanie works on starting a catering business while also beginning a new romantic relationship with local handyman Ben. Stephanie is also known to have a bad habit of making assumptions regarding romantic relationships such as believing that Cassie had romantic feelings for Ryan and John and later when she assumed that Nick had feelings for Grace. In the beginning of the fourth season, Stephanie and Ben are revealed to have broken up as they don't see a real future for their relationship. In season five, Stephanie goes into  partnership with Vincent to operate a [[food truck]] business, and begins a romantic relationship with Adam Hawkins, the hospital pastor.\n*[[Marc Bendavid]] as Donovan Davenport: the Mayor of Blairsville and Abigail's love interest.

Purity can be roughly assessed by the nugget color, the richer and deeper the orange-yellow the higher the gold content.
