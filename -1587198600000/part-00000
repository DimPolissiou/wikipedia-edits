Approximately 1-2% of patients taking the drug show elevated levels of liver [[transaminase]] enzymes, a marker for liver toxicity, though serious cases are rare. Over 200,000 children with ADHD were prescribed pemoline in the US and Canada alone during the 25 years it was available, plus a smaller number of adults prescribed it for indications such as [[chronic fatigue syndrome]] and [[apathy]] in the elderly (and not including prescriptions in the rest of the world), so the number of liver failure cases was statistically not that large. However the reactions proved idiosyncratic and unpredictable, with patients sometimes taking the drug with no issue for months or even years, before suddenly developing severe liver toxicity. There was no clear exposure-toxicity relationship, and no characteristic liver [[pathology]] findings. Some patients showed as little as one week between first appearance of [[jaundice]] and complete liver failure, and some of the patients that developed liver failure had not showed elevated liver transaminase levels when tested previously.<ref name=\"pmid18217792\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Etwel FA, Rieder MJ, Bend JR, Koren G |title=A surveillance method for the early identification of idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions |journal=Drug Saf |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=169\u201380 |year=2008 |pmid=18217792 |doi= 10.2165/00002018-200831020-00006|url=}}</ref> Pemoline (as Betanamin) continues to be available in Japan, where no liver failure cases have been reported associated with its use, however it is only prescribed for the niche indication of [[narcolepsy]], and at a lower dose than previously used in the USA.<ref>Shader RI.

Over 200,000 children with ADHD were prescribed pemoline in the US and Canada alone during the 25 years it was available, plus a smaller number of adults prescribed it for indications such as [[chronic fatigue syndrome]] and [[apathy]] in the elderly (and not including prescriptions in the rest of the world), so the number of liver failure cases was statistically not that large. However the reactions proved idiosyncratic and unpredictable, with patients sometimes taking the drug with no issue for months or even years, before suddenly developing severe liver toxicity. There was no clear exposure-toxicity relationship, and no characteristic liver [[pathology]] findings.

She was born in the family of [[Chandel (Rajput clan)|Chandel]] king Keerat Rai. She was born at the fort of [[Kalinjar]] ([[Banda district (India)|Banda]], [[Uttar Pradesh]]). Rani Durgavati's achievements further enhanced the glory of her ancestral tradition of courage and patronage.\n\n==Life==\nIn 1542, she was married to Dalpat Shah,the eldest son of king [[Sangram Shah]] of [[Gondwana Kingdom|Gondwana kingdom]]. The [[Chandela|Chandel]] and [[Gondi people|Rajgond]] dynasties were allied because of this marriage. This resulted in Keerat Rai gaining the help of the Gonds at the time of Muslim invasion of [[Sher Shah Suri]].\n\nShe gave birth to a son in 1545 A.D. who was named Vir Narayan. Dalpat Shah died in 1550 and due to the young age of Vir Narayan, Durgavati took the reins of the Gond kingdom. [[Diwan (title)|Diwan]] Beohar Adhar Simha and Minister Man Thakur helped the Rani in looking after the administration successfully and effectively. Rani moved her capital to [[Pachmarhi:Chauragarh|Chauragarh]] in place of \n[[Singorgarh fort]]. It was a fort of strategic importance situated on the [[Satpura]] hill range.\n\nAfter the death of Sher Shah, Shuja'at Khan captured [[Malwa]] and was succeeded by his son [[Baz Bahadur]] in 1556. After ascending to the throne, Baz attacked Rani Durgavati but the attack was repulsed.\n\nIn the year 1562, [[Akbar the Great]] vanquished the [[Malwa]] ruler [[Baz Bahadur]] and conquered [[Malwa]], made it a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] dominion. Consequently, the state boundary of Rani touched the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Sultanate]].\n\nRani's contemporary was a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] General, Khwaja Abdul Majid Asaf Khan, an ambitious man who vanquished Ramchandra, the ruler of [[Rewa (princely state)|Rewa]]. The prosperity of Rani Durgavati's state lured him and he invaded Rani's state after taking permission from [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Akbar]]. This plan of Mughal invasion was the result of [[expansionism]] and [[imperialism]] of Akbar.\n\nWhen Rani heard about the attack by Asaf Khan she decided to defend her kingdom with all her might although her Diwan Beohar Adhar Simha (Adhar Kayastha) <ref>https://byjus.com/pdf/Medieval-India-Satish-Chandra.pdf</ref> pointed out the strength of Mughal forces. Rani maintained that it was better to die respectfully than to live a disgraceful life.\n\nTo fight a defensive battle, she went to Narrai, situated between a hilly range on one side and two rivers [[Gaur]] and [[Narmada]] on the other side. It was an unequal battle with trained soldiers and modern weapons in multitude on the Mughal side and a few untrained soldiers with old weapons on the side of Rani Durgavati. Her Faujdar Arjun Das was killed in the battle and Rani decided to lead the defence herself. As the enemy entered the valley, soldiers of Rani attacked them. Both sides lost some men but Rani lost more.\n\nAt this stage, Rani reviewed her strategy with her counselors. She wanted to attack the enemy in the night to enfeeble them but her lieutenants did not accept her suggestion. By next morning Asaf Khan had summoned big guns. Rani rode on her elephant Sarman and came for the battle. Her son Vir Narayan also took part in this battle. He forced Mughal army to move back three times but at last, he got wounded and had to retire to a safe place. In the course of battle, Rani also got injured badly near her ear with an arrow. Another arrow pierced her neck and she lost her consciousness. On regaining consciousness she perceived that defeat was imminent.

Pyke-Nott and Erekosima Houses were named after two erstwhile Principals of the school. Owerri House was named in honour of the city. Njemanze is the name of the royal family of Owerri<ref>{{Cite book|title=Words of a Shaman|last=Ogbuagu|first=Nkwachukwu|publisher=Austin Macauley|year=2019|isbn=9781528908337|location=London|pages=20}}</ref>. Azikiwe, of course, was named after Zik, the first President of Nigeria. These Houses competed against each other during the inter-house sports competitions, which featured field and track events.\n\n== School Anthem ==\nRemember where you come from\n\nWherever you may chance to go\n\nUphold your supremacy to do or to die for the right.\n\nOur alma mater and the country\n\nWe shall always hold them dear\n\nFor the Lord will surely bless thee, good G.S.S.O.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Words of a Shaman|last=Ogbuagu|first=Nkwachukwu|publisher=Austin Macauley|year=2019|isbn=9781528908337|location=London|pages=116}}</ref>\n\n== Old Students' Association ==\nPast students of GSSO refer to themselves as \"ogssians\". There is no single official external body responsible for coordinating these groups as many of them can be found in different cities in Nigeria and other countries. The groups, oftentimes, donate to the schools or hold motivational talks to positively inspire current students.\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n*[[C. J.

In the game Kanji is a high school student who becomes famous in television after fighting delinquents in the streets. Kanji becomes a victim of a series of kidnappings where the person is thrown to a dimension known as the TV World and the main cast of characters goes to save him from his alternate self, his Shadow. After Kanji is saved from the experience with the Shadow being turned into a power known as Persona, he joins the Investigation Team, befriending them in the process. He has also appeared in other works such as the fighting game ''[[Persona 4 Arena]]'' and the crossover ''[[Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth]]''. He is voiced by [[Tomokazu Seki]].\n\nKanji has received generally positive reception for his role in ''Persona 4'' including his Social Links where he undergoes character development. However, his ambiguous sexual preference has become one of the game's most controversial themes with several writers commenting on whether the game does a good job in explaining Kanji's personality.\n\n==Concept and creation==\n[[File:Kanjiearlydesigns.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Early designs for Kanji]]\n\nEarly designs of Kanji were drastically different from the final one.

Kanji's sexual orientation was left ambiguous to all players.<ref name=\"1up.com\"/> Namba added \"We would like everyone to play through the game and come up with their own answers to that question; there is no official answer ...

Kanji becomes a victim of a series of kidnappings where the person is thrown to a dimension known as the TV World and the main cast of characters goes to save him from his alternate self, his Shadow. After Kanji is saved from the experience with the Shadow being turned into a power known as Persona, he joins the Investigation Team, befriending them in the process. He has also appeared in other works such as the fighting game ''[[Persona 4 Arena]]'' and the crossover ''[[Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth]]''. He is voiced by [[Tomokazu Seki]] in Japanese, and [[Troy Baker]] in English in ''Persona 4'', ''Persona 4 Golden'', ''Persona 4: Arena'', and the first twelve episodes of ''Persona 4: The Animation''; his English voice actor for the remainder of ''Persona 4: The Animation'', as well as all subsequent games, is [[Matthew Mercer]].<ref name=\"mercer p4au pq\">{{cite tweet | number=482663053742186498  | title= I just heard we are green lit to talk about it!
