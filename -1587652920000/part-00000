This theory is based on similarities between numerous of the customs adopted by the two groups, particularly with regard to marking various significant life stages such as childbirth and death, as well as their matrilineal practices and martial history. Oral history, folk songs and other old writings indicate that the Ezhavas were at some point in the past members of the armed forces serving various kings, including the [[Zamorin]]s of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] and the rulers of the [[Cochin dynasty]]. [[Cyriac Pullapilly]] has said that only a common parentage can explain some of these issues.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\">[[#Smith1976|Pullapilly (1976)]] pp. 26\u201330</ref>\n\nA theory has been proposed for the origins of the [[Caste system in Kerala|caste system in the Kerala region]] based on the actions of the Aryan [[Jain]]s introducing such distinctions prior to the 8th-century AD. This argues that the Jains needed protection when they arrived in the area and recruited sympathetic local people to provide it. These people were then distinguished from others in the local population by their occupation as protectors, with the others all being classed as out-caste. Pullapilly describes that this meant they \"... were given ''kshatriya'' functions, but only ''shudra'' status. Thus originated the Nairs.\" The Ezhavas, not being among the group protecting the Jains, became out-castes.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\nAn alternate theory states that the system was introduced by the [[Nambudiri]] Brahmins. Although Brahmin influences had existed in the area since at least the 1st century CE, there was a large influx from around the 8th century when they acted as priests, counsellors and ministers to invading Aryan princes. At the time of their arrival the non-aboriginal local population had been converted to Buddhism by missionaries who had come from the north of India and from Ceylon. The Brahmins used their symbiotic relationship with the invading forces to assert their beliefs and position. Buddhist temples and monasteries were either destroyed or taken over for use in Hindu practices, thus undermining the ability of the Buddhists to propagate their beliefs.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\nThe Buddhist tradition of the Ezhavas, and the refusal to give it up, pushed them to an outcaste role within the greater Brahminic society.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/><ref>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=A6MfPh-9DiEC&pg=PA25#PPA18,M1 | page = 18 | title = On life and times of George Joseph, 1887\u20131938, a Syrian Christian nationalist from Kerala | author = Joseph, George Gheverghese | publisher = Orient Longman | year = 2003 | accessdate = 2007-12-09 | isbn=978-81-250-2495-8}}</ref> This tradition is still evident as Ezhavas show greater interest in the moral, non-ritualistic, and non-dogmatic aspects of the religion rather than the theological.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\n==Past occupations==\n\nThe social anthropologists Filippo and Caroline Osella say that the Ezhavas \"...&nbsp;consisted in the mid-nineteenth century of a small landowning and titled elite and a large mass of landless and small tenants who were largely illiterate, considered untouchable, and who eked out a living by manual labour and petty trade.\"<ref name=\"Osella8\">{{cite book |title=Social Mobility in Kerala: Modernity and Identity in Conflict |first1=Filippo |last1=Osella |first2=Caroline |last2=Osella |publisher=Pluto Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-7453-1693-2 |page=8 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=rMRw0gTZSJwC&pg=PA8}}</ref>{{efn|Gough describes Thiyya subtenants in Central Travancore, who worked land held by the Nair caste.

This activity is sometimes erroneously referred to as ''toddy tapping'', toddy being a liquor manufactured from the sap. Arrack was another liquor produced from the palms, as was jaggery (an unrefined sugar). In reality, most Ezhavas were agricultural labourers and small-time cultivators, with a substantial number diverging into the production of [[coir]] products, such as coconut mats for flooring, from towards the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/> The coastal town of [[Alleppey]] became the centre of such manufacture and was mostly controlled by Ezhavas, although the lucrative export markets were accessible only through European traders, who monopolised the required equipment. A boom in trade for these manufactured goods after [[World War I]] led to a unique situation in twentieth-century Kerala whereby there was a shortage of labour, which attracted still more Ezhavas to the industry from outlying rural areas. The [[Great Depression]] impacted in particular on the export trade, causing a reduction in price and in wages even though production increased, with the consequence that during the 1930s many Ezhava families found themselves to be in dire financial circumstances.<ref name=\"Osella50\" /><ref>{{cite book |title=Communal Road to a Secular Kerala |first=George |last=Mathew |publisher=Concept Publishing Company |year=1989 |isbn=978-81-7022-282-8 |pages=137\u2013138 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1TuPeXFP0WgC&pg=PA137}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title='Destroy Capitalism!': Growing Solidarity of Alleppey's Coir Workers, 1930\u201340 |first=Robin |last=Jeffrey |authorlink=Robin Jeffrey |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |volume=19 |issue=29 |pages=1159\u20131165 |date=21 July 1984 |jstor=4373437}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nSome Ezhavas were involved in weaving and ship making.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bVgeAAAAMAAJ&dq=jaggery+izhava&q=jaggery|title= Religion and ideology in Kerala |page=246|first=Genevi\u00e8ve |last=Lemercinier|publisher=D.K.

The ritual is also called \"Mayilpeeli Thookkam\" because the costume includes a characteristic garment made of mayilppeeli ([[peacock]] feathers). This garment is worn around the waist in a similar fashion as the \"uduthukettu\" of [[Kathakali]]. The various dance movements are similar to kalarippayattu techniques. The performers have their faces painted green and wear distinctive headgears.  The all-night performance of the dance is usually presented solo or in pairs.<ref name = \"ezh22\"/>{{pn|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Makachuttu===\nMakachuttu art is popular among Ezhavas in [[Thiruvananthapuram]] and Chirayinkizhu taluks and in [[Kilimanoor]], Pazhayakunnummal and Thattathumala regions. In this, a group of eight performers, two each, twin around each other like serpents and rise up, battling with sticks. The techniques are repeated several times. [[Sandalwood]] paste on the forehead, a red towel round the head, red silk around the waist and bells round the ankles form the costume. This is a combination of [[snake worship]] and [[Kalarippayattu]].<ref name = \"ezh22\"/>{{pn|date=April 2020}}<ref name = \"ezh23\"/>{{pn|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Poorakkali===\nPoorakkali is a folk dance prevalent among the Ezhavas of Malabar, usually performed in Bhagavathy temples as a ritual offering during the month of [[Meenam]] (March\u2013April).  Poorakkali requires specially trained and highly experienced dancers, trained in Kalaripayattu.  Standing round a traditional lamp, the performers dance in eighteen different stages and rhythms, each phase called a niram.<ref name = \"ezh22\"/>{{pn|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Customs==\nEzhavas adopted different patterns of behavior in family system across [[Kerala]]. Those living in southern [[Travancore]] tended to meld the different practices that existed in the other parts of Kerala. The family arrangements of northern [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] were matrilineal with patrilocal property arrangements, whereas in northern Travancore they were matrilineal but usually matrilocal in their arrangements for property. Southern Malabar saw a patrilineal system but partible property.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/>\n\nThese arrangements were reformed by legislation, for Malabar in 1925 and for Travancore in 1933. The process of reform was more easily achieved for the Ezhavas than it was for the [[Nair]]s, another [[Caste system in India|Hindu caste]] in Kerala who adopted matrilineal arrangements; the situation for the Nairs was complicated by a traditional matrilocal form of living called ''[[tharavadu|taravadu]]'' and by their usually much higher degree of property ownership.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/>\n\n==Spiritual and social movements==\n[[File:Narayana Guru.jpg|thumb|Narayana Guru]]\nSome Thiyyas converted to [[Islam]] from around the 9th century, due to the influence of Arab traders.

This was named after [[Narayana Guru]], who had established an [[ashram]] from where he preached his message of \"one caste, one religion, one god\" and a Sanskritised version of the Victorian concept of self-help. His influence locally has been compared to that of [[Swami Vivekananda]].<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\" /> One of the initial aims of the SNDP was to campaign for the removal of the restrictions on school entry but even after those legal barriers to education were removed, it was uncommon in practice for Ezhavas to be admitted to government schools. Thus, the campaign shifted to providing schools operated by the community itself.<ref name=\"Padmanabhan\" /> The organisation, attracted support in Travancore but similar bodies in Cochin were less successful.

The [[Vaikom Satyagraha]] of 1924\u20131925 was a failed attempt to use the issue of [[avarna]] access to roads around temples in order to revive the fortunes of [[Indian National Congress|Congress]], orchestrated by [[T. K. Madhavan]], a revolutionary and civil rights activist,<ref name=\"Smith1976p38\">[[#Smith1976|Pullapilly (1976)]] p. 38</ref> and with a famous temple at [[Vaikom]] as the focal point. Although it failed in its stated aim of achieving access, the [[satyagraha]] (movement) did succeed in voicing a \"radical rhetoric\", according to Nossiter.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\"/> During this movement, a few [[Khalsa|Akalis]]{{mdash}}an order of armed [[Sikh]]s{{mdash}}came to Vaikom in support of the demonstrators. After the eventual passing of the Temple Entry Proclamation, some of the Akalis remained. They attracted some Ezhava youth to the concepts of the Sikhism, resulting in Ezhava conversions to that belief.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=C8EBAAAAMAAJ&q=sikhism+ezhava&dq=sikhism+ezhava|title= The abstention movement|page=19|first=K.K |last=Kusuman|publisher=Kerala Historical Society |year=1976|accessdate=2011-06-15}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the SNDP in improving the lot of Ezhavas has been questioned.

There was subsequently a radicalisation and much political infighting within the leadership as a consequence of the effects of the [[Great Depression]] on the [[coir]] industry but the general notion of self-help was not easy to achieve in a primarily agricultural environment; the Victorian concept presumed an industrialised economy. The organisation lost members to various other groups, including the Communist movement, and it was not until the 1950s that it reinvented itself as a pressure group and provider of educational opportunities along the lines of the [[Nair Service Society]] (NSS), Just as the NSS briefly formed the National Democratic Party in the 1970s in an attempt directly to enter the political arena, so too in 1972 the SNDP formed the Social Revolutionary Party.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\"/>\n\n==Position in society==\nThey were considered as ''avarna'' (outside brahmanical varna system) by the Nambudiri Brahmins who formed the Hindu clergy and ritual ruling elite in late medieval Kerala.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/> [[Kathleen Gough]] says that the Thiyyas of Central Travancore were historically the highest-ranking of the \"higher polluting castes\", a group whose other constituents included [[Kanisan]]s and various artisanal castes, and who were all superior in status to the \"lower polluting castes\", such as the [[Pulayar]]s and [[Paraiyar]]s.

These men were sent, ostensibly, to set up [[coconut]] farming in the region. Another version of the story says that the king sent eight martial families at the request of a Chera king to quell a civil war that had erupted against him.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Social and religious divergence===\nIt has been suggested that the Ezhavas may share a common heritage with the [[Nair]] caste. This theory is based on similarities between numerous of the customs adopted by the two groups, particularly with regard to marking various significant life stages such as childbirth and death, as well as their matrilineal practices and martial history. Oral history, folk songs and other old writings indicate that the Ezhavas were at some point in the past members of the armed forces serving various kings, including the [[Zamorin]]s of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] and the rulers of the [[Cochin dynasty]]. [[Cyriac Pullapilly]] has said that only a common parentage can explain some of these issues.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\">[[#Smith1976|Pullapilly (1976)]] pp. 26\u201330</ref>\n\nA theory has been proposed for the origins of the [[Caste system in Kerala|caste system in the Kerala region]] based on the actions of the Aryan [[Jain]]s introducing such distinctions prior to the 8th-century AD. This argues that the Jains needed protection when they arrived in the area and recruited sympathetic local people to provide it. These people were then distinguished from others in the local population by their occupation as protectors, with the others all being classed as out-caste. Pullapilly describes that this meant they \"... were given ''kshatriya'' functions, but only ''shudra'' status. Thus originated the Nairs.\" The Ezhavas, not being among the group protecting the Jains, became out-castes.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\nAn alternate theory states that the system was introduced by the [[Nambudiri]] Brahmins. Although Brahmin influences had existed in the area since at least the 1st century CE, there was a large influx from around the 8th century when they acted as priests, counsellors and ministers to invading Aryan princes. At the time of their arrival the non-aboriginal local population had been converted to Buddhism by missionaries who had come from the north of India and from Ceylon. The Brahmins used their symbiotic relationship with the invading forces to assert their beliefs and position. Buddhist temples and monasteries were either destroyed or taken over for use in Hindu practices, thus undermining the ability of the Buddhists to propagate their beliefs.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\nThe Buddhist tradition of the Ezhavas, and the refusal to give it up, pushed them to an outcaste role within the greater Brahminic society.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/><ref>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=A6MfPh-9DiEC&pg=PA25#PPA18,M1 | page = 18 | title = On life and times of George Joseph, 1887\u20131938, a Syrian Christian nationalist from Kerala | author = Joseph, George Gheverghese | publisher = Orient Longman | year = 2003 | accessdate = 2007-12-09 | isbn=978-81-250-2495-8}}</ref> This tradition is still evident as Ezhavas show greater interest in the moral, non-ritualistic, and non-dogmatic aspects of the religion rather than the theological.<ref name=\"Smith1976pp26-30\"/>\n\n==Past occupations==\n\nThe social anthropologists Filippo and Caroline Osella say that the Ezhavas \"...&nbsp;consisted in the mid-nineteenth century of a small landowning and titled elite and a large mass of landless and small tenants who were largely illiterate, considered untouchable, and who eked out a living by manual labour and petty trade.\"<ref name=\"Osella8\">{{cite book |title=Social Mobility in Kerala: Modernity and Identity in Conflict |first1=Filippo |last1=Osella |first2=Caroline |last2=Osella |publisher=Pluto Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-7453-1693-2 |page=8 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=rMRw0gTZSJwC&pg=PA8}}</ref>{{efn|Gough describes Thiyya subtenants in Central Travancore, who worked land held by the Nair caste.

This activity is sometimes erroneously referred to as ''toddy tapping'', toddy being a liquor manufactured from the sap. Arrack was another liquor produced from the palms, as was jaggery (an unrefined sugar). In reality, most Ezhavas were agricultural labourers and small-time cultivators, with a substantial number diverging into the production of [[coir]] products, such as coconut mats for flooring, from towards the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/> The coastal town of [[Alleppey]] became the centre of such manufacture and was mostly controlled by Ezhavas, although the lucrative export markets were accessible only through European traders, who monopolised the required equipment. A boom in trade for these manufactured goods after [[World War I]] led to a unique situation in twentieth-century Kerala whereby there was a shortage of labour, which attracted still more Ezhavas to the industry from outlying rural areas. The [[Great Depression]] impacted in particular on the export trade, causing a reduction in price and in wages even though production increased, with the consequence that during the 1930s many Ezhava families found themselves to be in dire financial circumstances.<ref name=\"Osella50\" /><ref>{{cite book |title=Communal Road to a Secular Kerala |first=George |last=Mathew |publisher=Concept Publishing Company |year=1989 |isbn=978-81-7022-282-8 |pages=137\u2013138 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1TuPeXFP0WgC&pg=PA137}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title='Destroy Capitalism!': Growing Solidarity of Alleppey's Coir Workers, 1930\u201340 |first=Robin |last=Jeffrey |authorlink=Robin Jeffrey |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |volume=19 |issue=29 |pages=1159\u20131165 |date=21 July 1984 |jstor=4373437}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\nSome Ezhavas were involved in weaving and ship making.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bVgeAAAAMAAJ&dq=jaggery+izhava&q=jaggery|title= Religion and ideology in Kerala |page=246|first=Genevi\u00e8ve |last=Lemercinier|publisher=D.K.

The ritual is also called \"Mayilpeeli Thookkam\" because the costume includes a characteristic garment made of mayilppeeli ([[peacock]] feathers). This garment is worn around the waist in a similar fashion as the \"uduthukettu\" of [[Kathakali]]. The various dance movements are similar to kalarippayattu techniques. The performers have their faces painted green and wear distinctive headgears.

In this, a group of eight performers, two each, twin around each other like serpents and rise up, battling with sticks. The techniques are repeated several times. [[Sandalwood]] paste on the forehead, a red towel round the head, red silk around the waist and bells round the ankles form the costume.

Poorakkali requires specially trained and highly experienced dancers, trained in Kalaripayattu.  Standing round a traditional lamp, the performers dance in eighteen different stages and rhythms, each phase called a niram.<ref name = \"ezh22\"/>{{pn|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Customs==\nEzhavas adopted different patterns of behavior in family system across [[Kerala]]. Those living in southern [[Travancore]] tended to meld the different practices that existed in the other parts of Kerala. The family arrangements of northern [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] were matrilineal with patrilocal property arrangements, whereas in northern Travancore they were matrilineal but usually matrilocal in their arrangements for property. Southern Malabar saw a patrilineal system but partible property.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/>\n\nThese arrangements were reformed by legislation, for Malabar in 1925 and for Travancore in 1933. The process of reform was more easily achieved for the Ezhavas than it was for the [[Nair]]s, another [[Caste system in India|Hindu caste]] in Kerala who adopted matrilineal arrangements; the situation for the Nairs was complicated by a traditional matrilocal form of living called ''[[tharavadu|taravadu]]'' and by their usually much higher degree of property ownership.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/>\n\n==Spiritual and social movements==\n[[File:Narayana Guru.jpg|thumb|Narayana Guru]]\nSome Thiyyas converted to [[Islam]] from around the 9th century, due to the influence of Arab traders.

This was named after [[Narayana Guru]], who had established an [[ashram]] from where he preached his message of \"one caste, one religion, one god\" and a Sanskritised version of the Victorian concept of self-help. His influence locally has been compared to that of [[Swami Vivekananda]].<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\" /> One of the initial aims of the SNDP was to campaign for the removal of the restrictions on school entry but even after those legal barriers to education were removed, it was uncommon in practice for Ezhavas to be admitted to government schools. Thus, the campaign shifted to providing schools operated by the community itself.<ref name=\"Padmanabhan\" /> The organisation, attracted support in Travancore but similar bodies in Cochin were less successful.

The [[Vaikom Satyagraha]] of 1924\u20131925 was a failed attempt to use the issue of [[avarna]] access to roads around temples in order to revive the fortunes of [[Indian National Congress|Congress]], orchestrated by [[T. K. Madhavan]], a revolutionary and civil rights activist,<ref name=\"Smith1976p38\">[[#Smith1976|Pullapilly (1976)]] p. 38</ref> and with a famous temple at [[Vaikom]] as the focal point. Although it failed in its stated aim of achieving access, the [[satyagraha]] (movement) did succeed in voicing a \"radical rhetoric\", according to Nossiter.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\"/> During this movement, a few [[Khalsa|Akalis]]{{mdash}}an order of armed [[Sikh]]s{{mdash}}came to Vaikom in support of the demonstrators. After the eventual passing of the Temple Entry Proclamation, some of the Akalis remained.

Membership had reached 50,000 by 1928 and 60,000 by 1974, but Nossiter notes that, \"From the Vaikom ''satyagraha'' onwards the SNDP had stirred the ordinary Ezhava without materially improving his position.\" The division in the 1920s of {{cvt|60000|acre|ha}} of properties previously held by substantial landowners saw the majority of Ezhava beneficiaries receive less than one acre each, although 2% of them took at least 40% of the available land. There was subsequently a radicalisation and much political infighting within the leadership as a consequence of the effects of the [[Great Depression]] on the [[coir]] industry but the general notion of self-help was not easy to achieve in a primarily agricultural environment; the Victorian concept presumed an industrialised economy. The organisation lost members to various other groups, including the Communist movement, and it was not until the 1950s that it reinvented itself as a pressure group and provider of educational opportunities along the lines of the [[Nair Service Society]] (NSS), Just as the NSS briefly formed the National Democratic Party in the 1970s in an attempt directly to enter the political arena, so too in 1972 the SNDP formed the Social Revolutionary Party.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982pp30-32\"/>\n\n==Position in society==\nThey were considered as ''avarna'' (outside brahmanical varna system) by the Nambudiri Brahmins who formed the Hindu clergy and ritual ruling elite in late medieval Kerala.<ref name=\"Nossiter1982p30\"/> [[Kathleen Gough]] says that the Thiyyas of Central Travancore were historically the highest-ranking of the \"higher polluting castes\", a group whose other constituents included [[Kanisan]]s and various artisanal castes, and who were all superior in status to the \"lower polluting castes\", such as the [[Pulayar]]s and [[Paraiyar]]s.

Such differences have serious implications for Muslims at large when it comes to their application of the Islamic obligation of zakat. For example, some scholars consider the wealth of children and insane individuals zakatable, others don't. Some scholars consider all agricultural products zakatable, others restrict zakat to specific kinds only. Some consider debts zakatable, others don't.

Such differences have serious implications for Muslims at large when it comes to their application of the Islamic obligation of zakat. For example, some scholars consider the wealth of children and insane individuals zakatable, others don't. Some scholars consider all agricultural products zakatable, others restrict zakat to specific kinds only. Some consider debts zakatable, others don't. Similar differences exist for business assets and women's jewelry.

The northern part of the city is located on [[Trinity Bay (Queensland)|Trinity Bay]] and the city centre is located on [[Trinity Inlet]]. To the south of the Trinity Inlet lies the Aboriginal community of Yarrabah. Some of the city's suburbs are located on flood plains. The [[Mulgrave River]] and [[Barron River (Queensland)|Barron River]] flow within the greater Cairns area but not through the CBD. The city's centre foreshore is located on a mud flat.\n\n===Urban layout===\n[[File:Esplanade, Cairns, 2015 (01).JPG|thumb|left|City centre of Cairns]]\n\nCairns is a provincial city, with a linear urban layout that runs from the south at Edmonton to the north at [[Ellis Beach]]. The city is approximately {{convert|52|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from north to south; it has experienced a recent [[urban sprawl]], with suburbs occupying land once used for sugar cane farming.\n\nThe ''Northern Beaches'' consist of a number of beach communities extending north along the coast.

From south to north, these are [[Machans Beach, Queensland|Machans Beach]], [[Holloways Beach, Queensland|Holloways Beach]], [[Yorkeys Knob, Queensland|Yorkeys Knob]], Trinity Park, [[Trinity Beach, Queensland|Trinity Beach]], [[Kewarra Beach, Queensland|Kewarra Beach]], [[Clifton Beach, Queensland|Clifton Beach]], [[Palm Cove, Queensland|Palm Cove]], and Ellis Beach.\n\nThe suburb of [[Smithfield, Queensland|Smithfield]] is inland against the mountains of the Great Dividing Range, between Yorkeys Knob and Trinity Park. It serves as the main hub for the Northern Beaches, with a modern shopping arcade, called Smithfield Shopping Centre.\n\nSouth of Smithfield and inland from the Northern Beaches along the edge of the Barron River [[flood plain]] are the suburbs of [[Caravonica, Queensland|Caravonica]], [[Kamerunga, Queensland|Kamerunga]], [[Freshwater, Queensland|Freshwater]], and [[Stratford, Queensland|Stratford]]. This area is sometimes referred to as Freshwater Valley, though it is actually the lower part of Redlynch Valley; further up the valley are the suburbs of Redlynch, on the western side of Redlynch Valley, and [[Brinsmead, Queensland|Brinsmead]] on the eastern side. Stratford, Freshwater, and Brinsmead are separated from Cairns city by Mount Whitfield (elevation {{convert|365|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}) and Whitfield Range. [[Crystal Cascades]] and [[Copperlode Falls Dam]] are also behind this range.

The Council consists of a directly elected mayor and 10 councillors, elected from 10 single-member divisions (or wards) using an optional [[Ranked voting systems|preferential voting]] system. Elections are held every four years.\n\nThe Cairns Region consists of three former local government areas. The first was the original [[City of Cairns]], consisting of the Cairns City region as listed above. The second, which was amalgamated in 1995, was the [[Shire of Mulgrave (Queensland)|Shire of Mulgrave]] (comprising the other areas, namely the Northern Beaches, Redlynch Valley and Southside). The town of Gordonvale was once called Nelson. The third area is the [[Shire of Douglas]], which amalgamated in 2008 during major statewide local government reforms.\n\nAt the time of the 1995 amalgamation, Cairns City had a population of approximately 40,000 and Mulgrave Shire had a population of approximately 60,000. Both local government authorities had chambers in the Cairns [[Central business district|CBD]]. The old Cairns City Council chambers has been converted into a new city library. In a controversial decision,<ref>{{cite news|work=The Cairns Post|title=Land Row|page=1|agency=News Limited|date=19 July 2001}}</ref> new Council chambers were constructed on previously contaminated land in the mainly industrial suburb of Portsmith.\n\nCairns has three representatives in the [[Queensland Parliament]], from the electoral districts of [[Electoral district of Barron River|Barron River]], [[Electoral district of Cairns|Cairns]] and [[Electoral district of Mulgrave (Queensland)|Mulgrave]]. The city is represented in the [[Parliament of Australia|Federal Parliament]] by representatives elected from the districts of [[Division of Leichhardt|Leichhardt]] and [[Division of Kennedy|Kennedy]].\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#bdb76b;\"\n! colspan=3|[[Cairns Region|Cairns Regional Council]]<ref>[http://www.cairns.qld.gov.au/about-council/mayor-and-councillors Cairns Regional Council Mayor and Councilors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113174703/http://www.cairns.qld.gov.au/about-council/mayor-and-councillors |date=13 January 2015 }}</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center\"|'''Division''' || style=\"text-align:center\"|'''Councillor'''\n|-\n| [[List of mayors of Cairns|Mayor]] || [[Bob Manning (mayor)|Bob Manning]]\n|-\n| 1 || Brett Moller\n|-\n| 2 || John Schilling\n|-\n| 3 || Cathy Zeiger\n|-\n| 4 || Terry James\n|-\n| 5 || Richie Bates\n|-\n| 6 || Linda Cooper\n|-\n| 7 || Max O'Halloran\n|-\n| 8 || Jessie Richardson\n|-\n| 9 || Brett Olds\n\n|}\n\n{{col-break}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#bdb76b;\"\n! colspan=4|[[Government of Queensland|Queensland]]<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/qld-election-2015/results/electorates/ 2015 Queensland State Election Results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225011053/http://www.abc.net.au/news/qld-election-2015/results/electorates/ |date=25 February 2015 }}</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center\"|'''District''' || style=\"text-align:center\"|'''Member of Parliament''' || style=\"text-align:center\"|'''Party''' || style=\"text-align:center\"|'''Term'''\n|-\n| [[Electoral district of Barron River|Barron River]] || [[Craig Crawford (Australian politician)|Craig Crawford]] || [[Australian Labor Party (Queensland Branch)|Labor]] || 2015\u2013\n|-\n| [[Electoral district of Cairns|Cairns]] || [[Rob Pyne]] || [[Australian Labor Party (Queensland Branch)|Labor]] || 2015\u2013\n|-\n| [[Electoral district of Mulgrave (Queensland)|Mulgrave]] || [[Curtis Pitt]] || [[Australian Labor Party (Queensland Branch)|Labor]] || 2009\u2013\n|}\n\n{{col-break}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#bdb76b;\"\n! colspan=4|[[Government of Australia|Australia]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center\"|'''Division''' || style=\"text-align:center\"|'''Member of Parliament''' || style=\"text-align:center\"|'''Party''' || style=\"text-align:center\"|'''Term'''\n|-\n| [[Division of Kennedy|Kennedy]] || [[Bob Katter]] || [[Katter's Australian Party|Katter's Australian]] || 1993\u2013\n|-\n| [[Division of Leichhardt|Leichhardt]] || [[Warren Entsch]] || [[Liberal National Party of Queensland|Liberal National]] || 2010\u2013\n|}\n\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Cairns night.JPG|thumb|right|Cairns at night; the wharves.

[[Edmonton, Queensland|Edmonton]] and [[White Rock, Queensland (Cairns Region)|White Rock]] south of Cairns were major military supply areas and U.S. [[Paratrooper]]s trained at [[Gordonvale]] and the [[Goldsborough Valley]]. A Special Forces training base was established at the old \"[[Fairview, Cairns|Fairview]]\" homestead on Munro's Hill, [[Mooroobool, Queensland|Mooroobool]]. This base was officially known as the [[Z Experimental Station]],<ref>{{cite book |title=The Heroes |last=McKie |first=Ronald |year=1960 |publisher=Angus & Robertson Ltd |location=Sydney|isbn=0-207-12133-8 |page=9}}</ref> but referred to informally as \"The House on the Hill\".\n\nAfter World War II, Cairns gradually developed into a centre for tourism. The opening of the [[Cairns Airport|Cairns International Airport]] in 1984 helped establish the city as a desirable destination for international tourism.\n\n==Population==\nAccording to the [[Census in Australia#2016|2016 census]] of Population, there were 144,787 people in Cairns (Significant Urban Area).\n* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 8.9% of the population.\n* 67.9% of people were born in Australia.

The northern part of the city is located on [[Trinity Bay (Queensland)|Trinity Bay]] and the city centre is located on [[Trinity Inlet]]. To the south of the Trinity Inlet lies the Aboriginal community of Yarrabah. Some of the city's suburbs are located on flood plains. The [[Mulgrave River]] and [[Barron River (Queensland)|Barron River]] flow within the greater Cairns area but not through the CBD. The city's centre foreshore is located on a mud flat.\n\n===Urban layout===\n[[File:Esplanade, Cairns, 2015 (01).JPG|thumb|left|City centre of Cairns]]\n\nCairns is a provincial city, with a linear urban layout that runs from the south at Edmonton to the north at [[Ellis Beach]]. The city is approximately {{convert|52|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from north to south; it has experienced a recent [[urban sprawl]], with suburbs occupying land once used for sugar cane farming.\n\nThe ''Northern Beaches'' consist of a number of beach communities extending north along the coast. In general, each beach suburb is at the end of a spur road extending from the [[Captain Cook Highway]]. From south to north, these are [[Machans Beach, Queensland|Machans Beach]], [[Holloways Beach, Queensland|Holloways Beach]], [[Yorkeys Knob, Queensland|Yorkeys Knob]], Trinity Park, [[Trinity Beach, Queensland|Trinity Beach]], [[Kewarra Beach, Queensland|Kewarra Beach]], [[Clifton Beach, Queensland|Clifton Beach]], [[Palm Cove, Queensland|Palm Cove]], and Ellis Beach.\n\nThe suburb of [[Smithfield, Queensland|Smithfield]] is inland against the mountains of the Great Dividing Range, between Yorkeys Knob and Trinity Park. It serves as the main hub for the Northern Beaches, with a modern shopping arcade, called Smithfield Shopping Centre.\n\nSouth of Smithfield and inland from the Northern Beaches along the edge of the Barron River [[flood plain]] are the suburbs of [[Caravonica, Queensland|Caravonica]], [[Kamerunga, Queensland|Kamerunga]], [[Freshwater, Queensland|Freshwater]], and [[Stratford, Queensland|Stratford]]. This area is sometimes referred to as Freshwater Valley, though it is actually the lower part of Redlynch Valley; further up the valley are the suburbs of Redlynch, on the western side of Redlynch Valley, and [[Brinsmead, Queensland|Brinsmead]] on the eastern side. Stratford, Freshwater, and Brinsmead are separated from Cairns city by Mount Whitfield (elevation {{convert|365|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}) and Whitfield Range. [[Crystal Cascades]] and [[Copperlode Falls Dam]] are also behind this range. ([[Kuranda, Queensland|Kuranda]], a town on the Barron River on the western side of the Macalister Range, forms part of the Cairns economic catchment but is in the [[Tablelands Region|Tablelands local government]] area and is not part of the Cairns urban area.)\n\nThe city centre of Cairns is adjacent to the suburbs of [[Cairns North]], and Parramatta Park, [[Bungalow, Queensland|Bungalow]], Portsmith, and close to [[Westcourt, Queensland|Westcourt]], Manunda, [[Manoora, Queensland|Manoora]], Edge Hill, Whitfield, [[Kanimbla, Queensland|Kanimbla]], [[Mooroobool, Queensland|Mooroobool]], Earlville, [[Woree, Queensland|Woree]] and [[Bayview Heights, Queensland|Bayview Heights]]. The small suburb of [[Aeroglen, Queensland|Aeroglen]] is pressed between Mount Whitfield and the airport, on the Captain Cook Highway between Cairns North and Stratford.\n\n''Southside Cairns'', situated in a narrow area between Trinity Inlet to the east and Lamb Range to the west, includes the suburbs of White Rock, Mount Sheridan, [[Bentley Park, Queensland|Bentley Park]] and [[Edmonton, Queensland|Edmonton]]. The townships of Goldsborough, Little Mulgrave, and Aloomba are near [[Gordonvale, Queensland|Gordonvale]], on the Mulgrave River. This area is serviced by the [[Bruce Highway]]. Several other small towns and communities within Cairns' jurisdiction are sparsely located along the Bruce highway, the furthest being [[Mirriwinni, Queensland|Mirriwinni]], {{Convert|66|km|abbr=on}} south of Cairns city; the largest of these townships is [[Babinda]], about {{Convert|60|km|abbr=on}} from the city.\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Children on tropical beach.jpg|thumb|Tropical beach in Cairns]]\nCairns experiences a tropical [[climate]], specifically a [[tropical monsoon climate]] (Am) under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Tapper|first=Andrew|last2=Tapper|first2=Nigel|title=The weather and climate of Australia and New Zealand|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne, Australia|isbn=0-19-553393-3|edition=First|editor=Gray, Kathleen|page=300}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Linacre | first = Edward |author2=Geerts, Bart | title = Climates and Weather Explained | publisher=Routledge | location = London | year = 1997 | page = 379 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=mkZa1KLHCAQC&lpg=PA379&pg=PA379#v=onepage&q= | isbn = 0-415-12519-7}}</ref> A [[wet season]] with heavy monsoonal downpours runs from November to May, with a relatively [[dry season]] from June to October, though light showers can occur during this period.<ref name=CoC>{{cite web|title=Climate of Cairns|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/qld/cairns/climate.shtml|work=Bureau of Meteorology|accessdate=13 April 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110320220732/http://www.bom.gov.au/qld/cairns/climate.shtml|archivedate=20 March 2011}}</ref> Cairns' mean annual rainfall is just under {{convert|2000|mm|in}}, although monthly totals in the wet season (Dec\u2013Mar) can exceed {{convert|1000|mm|in|abbr=on}}, with the highest rainfall being recorded in any month in January 1981, where over {{convert|1417.4|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain fell.<ref name=ave>{{cite web |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_031011_All.shtml |title=Climate statistics for Cairns Aero AWS |accessdate=23 October 2011 |publisher=Bureau of Meteorology |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111032613/http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_031011_All.shtml |archivedate=11 January 2012  }}</ref> [[Babinda, Queensland|Babinda]], a town to the south of the city, is Australia's wettest town, recording an annual rainfall of over {{convert|4200|mm|in|abbr=on}}.\n\nCairns has hot, humid summers and warm winters.<ref name=CoC/> Mean maximum temperatures vary from {{convert|26.2|C|F}} in July to {{convert|31.7|C|F}} in January.

The Council consists of a directly elected mayor and 10 councillors, elected from 10 single-member divisions (or wards) using an optional [[Ranked voting systems|preferential voting]] system. Elections are held every four years.\n\nThe Cairns Region consists of three former local government areas. The first was the original [[City of Cairns]], consisting of the Cairns City region as listed above. The second, which was amalgamated in 1995, was the [[Shire of Mulgrave (Queensland)|Shire of Mulgrave]] (comprising the other areas, namely the Northern Beaches, Redlynch Valley and Southside). The town of Gordonvale was once called Nelson. The third area is the [[Shire of Douglas]], which amalgamated in 2008 during major statewide local government reforms.\n\nAt the time of the 1995 amalgamation, Cairns City had a population of approximately 40,000 and Mulgrave Shire had a population of approximately 60,000. Both local government authorities had chambers in the Cairns [[Central business district|CBD]]. The old Cairns City Council chambers has been converted into a new city library. In a controversial decision,<ref>{{cite news|work=The Cairns Post|title=Land Row|page=1|agency=News Limited|date=19 July 2001}}</ref> new Council chambers were constructed on previously contaminated land in the mainly industrial suburb of Portsmith.\n\nCairns has three representatives in the [[Queensland Parliament]], from the electoral districts of [[Electoral district of Barron River|Barron River]], [[Electoral district of Cairns|Cairns]] and [[Electoral district of Mulgrave (Queensland)|Mulgrave]]. The city is represented in the [[Parliament of Australia|Federal Parliament]] by representatives elected from the districts of [[Division of Leichhardt|Leichhardt]] and [[Division of Kennedy|Kennedy]].\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#bdb76b;\"\n! colspan=3|[[Cairns Region|Cairns Regional Council]]<ref>[http://www.cairns.qld.gov.au/about-council/mayor-and-councillors Cairns Regional Council Mayor and Councilors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113174703/http://www.cairns.qld.gov.au/about-council/mayor-and-councillors |date=13 January 2015 }}</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center\"|'''Division''' || style=\"text-align:center\"|'''Councillor'''\n|-\n| [[List of mayors of Cairns|Mayor]] || [[Bob Manning (mayor)|Bob Manning]]\n|-\n| 1 || Brett Moller\n|-\n| 2 || John Schilling\n|-\n| 3 || Cathy Zeiger\n|-\n| 4 || Terry James\n|-\n| 5 || Richie Bates\n|-\n| 6 || Linda Cooper\n|-\n| 7 || Max O'Halloran\n|-\n| 8 || Jessie Richardson\n|-\n| 9 || Brett Olds\n\n|}\n\n{{col-break}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#bdb76b;\"\n! colspan=4|[[Government of Queensland|Queensland]]<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/qld-election-2015/results/electorates/ 2015 Queensland State Election Results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225011053/http://www.abc.net.au/news/qld-election-2015/results/electorates/ |date=25 February 2015 }}</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center\"|'''District''' || style=\"text-align:center\"|'''Member of Parliament''' || style=\"text-align:center\"|'''Party''' || style=\"text-align:center\"|'''Term'''\n|-\n| [[Electoral district of Barron River|Barron River]] || [[Craig Crawford (Australian politician)|Craig Crawford]] || [[Australian Labor Party (Queensland Branch)|Labor]] || 2015\u2013\n|-\n| [[Electoral district of Cairns|Cairns]] || [[Rob Pyne]] || [[Australian Labor Party (Queensland Branch)|Labor]] || 2015\u2013\n|-\n| [[Electoral district of Mulgrave (Queensland)|Mulgrave]] || [[Curtis Pitt]] || [[Australian Labor Party (Queensland Branch)|Labor]] || 2009\u2013\n|}\n\n{{col-break}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#bdb76b;\"\n! colspan=4|[[Government of Australia|Australia]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center\"|'''Division''' || style=\"text-align:center\"|'''Member of Parliament''' || style=\"text-align:center\"|'''Party''' || style=\"text-align:center\"|'''Term'''\n|-\n| [[Division of Kennedy|Kennedy]] || [[Bob Katter]] || [[Katter's Australian Party|Katter's Australian]] || 1993\u2013\n|-\n| [[Division of Leichhardt|Leichhardt]] || [[Warren Entsch]] || [[Liberal National Party of Queensland|Liberal National]] || 2010\u2013\n|}\n\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Cairns night.JPG|thumb|right|Cairns at night; the wharves.

It runs private trains on the rail network owned by the Queensland State Government and managed by QR's Network Division.\n\nThe [[Kuranda Scenic Railway]] operates from Cairns. The tourist railway ascends the Macalister Range and is not used for commuter services. It passes through the suburbs of Stratford, Freshwater (stopping at Freshwater Station) and Redlynch before reaching Kuranda.\n\nFreight services to [[Forsayth, Queensland|Forsayth]] were discontinued in the mid-1990s. These were mixed freight and passenger services that served the semi-remote towns west of the Great Dividing Range. There is now a weekly passenger-only service, ''The [[Savannahlander]]'', that leaves Cairns on Wednesday mornings. The Savannahlander is run by a private company, Cairns Kuranda Steam Trains.\n\nCairns is served by a [[narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] cane railway (or cane train) network that hauls harvested sugar cane to the [[Mulgrave Sugar Mill]] located in Gordonvale.

There are two ERL stations at the airport: [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport ERL station|KLIA station]] at the Main Terminal Building and [[klia2 ERL station|klia2 station]] at Gateway@klia2. The airport is served by two rail services on the ERL:\n* [[KLIA Ekspres]]: The dedicated [[airport rail link]] which runs non-stop between KL Sentral and KLIA. The journey takes 28 minutes to/from KLIA, and 33 minutes to/from klia2 with a two-minute stop at KLIA. The KLIA Ekspres terminal at KL Sentral is known as the [[KL Sentral#KL City Air Terminal|KL City Air Terminal]] (KL CAT), which has an [[IATA]] designation '''XKL'''. KL CAT offers in-town flight check-in service up to two hours before flight departure time for passengers travelling on [[Cathay Pacific]], [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]], [[Etihad Airways]], [[Malaysia Airlines]], [[Malindo Air]] and [[Royal Brunei Airlines]].\n* [[KLIA Transit]]: A [[commuter rail]] service which stops at three additional stops ([[Bandar Tasik Selatan station|Bandar Tasik Selatan]], [[Putrajaya/Cyberjaya ERL station|Putrajaya/Cyberjaya]] and [[Salak Tinggi ERL station|Salak Tinggi]]) between KL Sentral and KLIA. The journey takes 35 minutes to/from KLIA and 39 minutes to/from klia2. Check-in facilities are only through automated kiosks at KLIA Transit stations.\n\n===Taxis and limousine===\nAirport taxis or airport limousines are provided by Airport Limo. The taxis and limousines are readily available at the Taxi and Limousine counters. They run from airport itself to destinations in Klang Valley and Greater Klang Valley. The fares are to be paid at the counter and are charged according to the destinations' zone. A surcharge is applied for services between 12&nbsp;am to 5&nbsp;am\n\n===Bus===\nBoth public and private buses connect KLIA and klia2 to several points in Kuala Lumpur and beyond. Direct buses to the city centre take about an hour and run every 10 to 15 minutes during peak hours. All buses are air-conditioned. Bus tickets to [[Kuala Lumpur Sentral station|KL Sentral]] transportation hub cost RM11 and to [[Putra Heights station|Putra Heights LRT station]] cost RM4.\n\n==Expansion and developments==\n\n===Plans===\n[[File:KLIAAeropolis.jpg|thumb|KLIA Aeropolis Masterplan]]\n\nWith the slight modification of the masterplan, the future Terminal 2's satellite terminal will be combined into one satellite terminal. The expansion of Terminal 2's satellite terminal will be exactly the same as Terminal 1's (the current Main Terminal) satellite terminal, where initially the satellite terminal will have four arms, and another four arms when the terminal reached its capacity. There is sufficient land and capacity to develop facilities to handle up to 97.5 million passengers a year, four runways by the year 2020 and two mega-terminals, each linked with satellite terminals.<ref name=\"KLIA Phases\"/>\n\n{| class=\"collapsible wikitable collapsed\" style=\"width: 70% ; font-size: 85%; border: #999 solid 1px; text-align: lcenter; margin-bottom: 0; margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n! colspan=5 style=\"background: #8B8589;\"| Summary of Kuala Lumpur International Airport Masterplan\n|- style=\"font-weight:bold; background:#d3d3d3;\"\n!Phase!!Year!!Description\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Phase 1||1998||Initial Capacity of 25 million Passenger Per Annum\n|-\n|2006||Capable of Handling 35 million Passengers per annum with the construction of Low Cost Carrier Terminal\n|-\n|Phase 2||2008||Expansion of Low Cost Carrier Terminal to accommodate 40 Million Passengers per annum.\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Phase 3||2011||New Low Cost Carrier Terminal will be constructed to accommodate additional 30 million (55 million) passengers Per Annum, Current Low Cost Carrier Terminal converted to cargo usage.\n|-\n|Not fixed||Satellite Terminal B will be constructed to handle maximum of 75 million passengers.

It is the world's [[World's busiest airports by passenger traffic|23rd-busiest airport by total passenger traffic]].\n\nThe airport is operated by [[Malaysia Airports]] (MAHB) Sepang Sdn Bhd and is the major hub of [[Malaysia Airlines]], [[MASkargo]], [[AirAsia]], [[AirAsia X]], [[Malindo Air]], [[flyGlobal]], [[UPS Airlines]] and [[AsiaCargo Express]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\n[[File:Klia entrance.jpg|thumb|left|KLIA main entrance from the side]]\n[[File:KLIAMTB.jpg|alt=|thumb|KLIA Main terminal architecture]]\nThe ground breaking ceremony for Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) took place on 1 June 1993 <ref>{{cite web|url=https://diveintomalaysia.com/klia-klia2/|title=KLIA/KLIA2|website=Dive Into Malaysia|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-01}}</ref> when the government under [[Mahathir Mohamad]] decided that the existing Kuala Lumpur airport, then known as [[Subang International Airport]] (now [[Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport]]) could not handle future demand. The construction of the airport was done mainly by a few state owned construction companies as well as Ekovest Berhad \u2013 helmed by Tan Sri Datuk [[Lim Kang Hoo]]. It was created as part of the [[Multimedia Super Corridor]], a grand development plan for Malaysia. The chief architect who designed the new airport terminal was the Japanese architect [[Kisho Kurokawa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kisho.co.jp/page/223.html|title=KISHO KUROKAWA|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nUpon KLIA's completion, Subang Airport's Terminal 1 building was demolished. [[Malaysia Airports]] agreed to redevelop the remaining Terminal 3 to create a specialist airport for turboprop and charter planes surrounded by a residential area and a business park. The [[IATA]] airport code '''KUL''' was transferred from Subang Airport, which currently handles only turboprop aircraft, general aviation and military aircraft.

Building]]\n\nThe [[AeroTrain (KLIA)|Aerotrain]] is an [[People mover|automated people mover]] (APM) that connects the airside of KLIA Main Terminal Building (MTB) and the Satellite Building. Each 250-person capacity train can transport 3,000 passengers per hour in each direction at up to 56&nbsp;km/h (35&nbsp;mph). These three-car driverless trains run on elevated rail and under the taxiways. The journey takes under two minutes. The Aerotrain operates between three and five-minute intervals between terminal. Automatic train controls manage the operation of the entire Aerotrain system, controlling the speeds, headways, stops and door openings in stations, and integrating functions that enhance the reliability and performance of the system.<ref name=\"Kiat.net: Kuala Lumpur International\">{{cite web|title=Kuala Lumpur International |url=http://kiat.net/klia/index.html |publisher=Kiat.net |accessdate=19 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503161615/http://www.kiat.net/klia/index.html |archivedate=3 May 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===External connections===\n\n====Rail====\n{{Main|Express Rail Link|KLIA Ekspres|KLIA Transit|Kuala Lumpur International Airport ERL station|klia2 ERL station}}\n\nKuala Lumpur International Airport is linked to the [[KL Sentral]] transportation hub in the city centre by the {{cvt|57|km}} long [[Express Rail Link]] (ERL). There are two ERL stations at the airport: [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport ERL station|KLIA station]] at the Main Terminal Building and [[klia2 ERL station|klia2 station]] at Gateway@klia2. The airport is served by two rail services on the ERL:\n* [[KLIA Ekspres]]: The dedicated [[airport rail link]] which runs non-stop between KL Sentral and KLIA. The journey takes 28 minutes to/from KLIA, and 33 minutes to/from klia2 with a two-minute stop at KLIA. The KLIA Ekspres terminal at KL Sentral is known as the [[KL Sentral#KL City Air Terminal|KL City Air Terminal]] (KL CAT), which has an [[IATA]] designation '''XKL'''. KL CAT offers in-town flight check-in service up to two hours before flight departure time for passengers travelling on [[Cathay Pacific]], [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]], [[Etihad Airways]], [[Malaysia Airlines]], [[Malindo Air]] and [[Royal Brunei Airlines]].\n* [[KLIA Transit]]: A [[commuter rail]] service which stops at three additional stops ([[Bandar Tasik Selatan station|Bandar Tasik Selatan]], [[Putrajaya/Cyberjaya ERL station|Putrajaya/Cyberjaya]] and [[Salak Tinggi ERL station|Salak Tinggi]]) between KL Sentral and KLIA. The journey takes 35 minutes to/from KLIA and 39 minutes to/from klia2. Check-in facilities are only through automated kiosks at KLIA Transit stations.\n\n===Taxis and limousine===\nAirport taxis or airport limousines are provided by Airport Limo. The taxis and limousines are readily available at the Taxi and Limousine counters. They run from airport itself to destinations in Klang Valley and Greater Klang Valley. The fares are to be paid at the counter and are charged according to the destinations' zone. A surcharge is applied for services between 12&nbsp;am to 5&nbsp;am\n\n===Bus===\nBoth public and private buses connect KLIA and klia2 to several points in Kuala Lumpur and beyond. Direct buses to the city centre take about an hour and run every 10 to 15 minutes during peak hours. All buses are air-conditioned. Bus tickets to [[Kuala Lumpur Sentral station|KL Sentral]] transportation hub cost RM11 and to [[Putra Heights station|Putra Heights LRT station]] cost RM4.\n\n==Expansion and developments==\n\n===Plans===\n[[File:KLIAAeropolis.jpg|thumb|KLIA Aeropolis Masterplan]]\n\nWith the slight modification of the masterplan, the future Terminal 2's satellite terminal will be combined into one satellite terminal. The expansion of Terminal 2's satellite terminal will be exactly the same as Terminal 1's (the current Main Terminal) satellite terminal, where initially the satellite terminal will have four arms, and another four arms when the terminal reached its capacity. There is sufficient land and capacity to develop facilities to handle up to 97.5 million passengers a year, four runways by the year 2020 and two mega-terminals, each linked with satellite terminals.<ref name=\"KLIA Phases\"/>\n\n{| class=\"collapsible wikitable collapsed\" style=\"width: 70% ; font-size: 85%; border: #999 solid 1px; text-align: lcenter; margin-bottom: 0; margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n! colspan=5 style=\"background: #8B8589;\"| Summary of Kuala Lumpur International Airport Masterplan\n|- style=\"font-weight:bold; background:#d3d3d3;\"\n!Phase!!Year!!Description\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Phase 1||1998||Initial Capacity of 25 million Passenger Per Annum\n|-\n|2006||Capable of Handling 35 million Passengers per annum with the construction of Low Cost Carrier Terminal\n|-\n|Phase 2||2008||Expansion of Low Cost Carrier Terminal to accommodate 40 Million Passengers per annum.\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Phase 3||2011||New Low Cost Carrier Terminal will be constructed to accommodate additional 30 million (55 million) passengers Per Annum, Current Low Cost Carrier Terminal converted to cargo usage.\n|-\n|Not fixed||Satellite Terminal B will be constructed to handle maximum of 75 million passengers.

KLIA is the only airport in Malaysia that accommodate the landing and take off of the A380. Upgrading works started on 3 April 2006, and was completed by 28 May 2007. Works include the provision of shoulders on both sides of the two existing runways of 15 meters as well as the taxiways, building additional aerobridges at the three departure halls, namely C17, C27 and C37, and enhancing the mezzanine lounges for upper deck passengers of the aircraft at the departure halls.

Bonfire night's [[sectarian]] significance has generally been lost: it is now usually just a night of revelry with a bonfire and fireworks, although an effigy of Guy Fawkes is burned on the fire.

Like 5 November, this Bonfire Night also has its roots in the sectarian struggle between Protestants and Catholics. Unlike 5 November the sectarian significance of 11 July is still strong. It celebrates the [[Battle of the Boyne]] of 1690, in which the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[William III of England|William of Orange]] defeated the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[James II of England|James II]].<ref name=belfast>{{cite news|title=Bonfire repair bill revealed|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/3069141.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 May 2011|date=15 July 2003}}</ref>\n\nIn the city of Cork<ref name=\"auto\"/> and many rural parts of the Republic of Ireland \"Bonfire Night\" refers to 23 June, [[St John's Eve]] night.

It celebrates the [[Battle of the Boyne]] of 1690, in which the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[William III of England|William of Orange]] defeated the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[James II of England|James II]].<ref name=belfast>{{cite news|title=Bonfire repair bill revealed|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/3069141.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 May 2011|date=15 July 2003}}</ref>\n\nIn the city of Cork<ref name=\"auto\"/> and many rural parts of the Republic of Ireland \"Bonfire Night\" refers to 23 June, [[St John's Eve]] night.

The [[tram]] network serves most city neighbourhoods, and is the backbone of public transport within the city, albeit supplemented by the inner sections of the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn]], along with urban [[trolleybus]] and [[bus]] routes as well as two [[funicular]] railways and one [[rack railway]]. The trams and other city transport modes operate within a fare regime provided by the cantonal public transport authority [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund]] (ZVV), which also covers regional rail and bus services.<ref name=tutttctlr>{{cite news | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | title = Z\u00fcrich: Top city \u2014 thanks to light rail | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 130\u2013134 | date = April 2005}}</ref><ref name=tuttcraag>{{cite news | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | title =  Z\u00fcrich: The Cobra rules, all above ground | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 180\u2013184 | date = May 2005}}</ref><ref name=zacait>{{cite web |  first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/zurich05_0.html | title = Z\u00fcrich: A city and its trams | date = December 2005 | accessdate = 2011-08-10}}</ref>\n\nThe city's trams are operated by the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Z\u00fcrich]] (VBZ), which also manages the tramway infrastructure within the city, but the city's tram tracks are also used by two other operations.

Electrified from the 1890s, they have seen off challenges including proposals to replace them by [[trolleybuses]] and by a [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]] or [[U-Bahn]]. With a relatively static city network from the 1930s to the late 1970s, the city's trams have been expanding again since then. Recent expansions have taken the network into the suburbs beyond the city boundary, covering areas it retreated from in the first part of the 20th century. Further extensions have been approved, both to the city tram network itself, and by the introduction of a [[Limmattal light rail line|new light rail system]] in the [[Limmat Valley]] that will interwork with the city trams.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings===\n[[File:R\u00f6sslitram.jpg|thumb|left|One of Z\u00fcrich's horse trams  in 1900]]\nVarious projects to introduce trams to Z\u00fcrich were proposed from the 1860s onwards. It was not until 1882, however, that the first tram operated in the city. These initial trams were operated by the {{ill|Z\u00fcrcher Strassenbahn Gesellschaft|de}} (ZStG), a private company, and were of [[standard gauge]] ({{RailGauge|sg|disp=or}} gauge) and horse-drawn.<ref name=vbzfafch>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | title = Facts & figures - Corporate history | publisher = VBZ | accessdate = 2012-05-26 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121007013822/http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | archivedate = 2012-10-07 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1888 the first electric tramway in Switzerland (the [[Vevey\u2013Montreux\u2013Chillon tramway]]) had opened, and, in 1894, another private company, the {{ill|Elektrische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich|de}} (EStZ), started operating [[metre gauge]] ({{RailGauge|1000mm|first=imp|disp=1}} gauge) electric trams in Z\u00fcrich. The EStZ only survived for two years before it was taken over by the City of Z\u00fcrich, who renamed it the [[St\u00e4dtische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich]] (StStZ). The following year, the horse trams of the ZStG were acquired.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFurther tramway companies were founded, some operating entirely within the city, some connecting the city with its nearer suburbs, and some running in rural areas entirely beyond the city, but still linked by connections with other lines to the city. Like the EStZ, all these lines were electrified and were built to the metre gauge. The StStZ gradually took over those companies that had significant city operations, usually closing any cross-boundary lines, whilst leaving those lines entirely beyond the city to their own devices.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Many companies===\n[[File:Zuercher Strassenbahnlinien um 1899.jpg|thumb|The mix of routes in 1899, distinguishing city owned (''Stadt'') and private (''Privat''), and horse (''Pferdebahn'') and electric (''elektrisch'')]]\nThe many companies that operated trams in and around Z\u00fcrich are summarised in the table below.

The standard gauge horse tram lines had all been converted to metre gauge and electrified. The StStZ had also built many tram extensions, resulting in a dense network of tramlines serving most city neighbourhoods.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nHowever, in 1927, the StStZ had introduced its first [[motor bus]] route, and this was to be followed in 1939 by the first of the [[Trolleybuses in Z\u00fcrich|city's trolleybus routes]]. Initially these modes complemented the trams, but at various times they have threatened to replace parts of the tram system, and sometimes succeeded in doing so.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1940, the StStZ started a modernisation of its trams, introducing the first prototypes of the {{ill|Swiss Standard Tram|de|Schweizer Standardwagen|fr|Tramway standard suisse}}. Despite Switzerland's neutrality, the economic effects of the [[second world war]] slowed down the program, but by 1953 the VBZ, as the StStZ had become in 1950, had taken delivery of 177 such trams.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Lines closed===\n[[File:Wetzikon Meilen Bahn Gr\u00fcningen.JPG|thumb|left|The WMB in Gr\u00fcningen, prior to 1950]]\nWhile the tram network within the city of Z\u00fcrich has seen relatively few line closures, the same cannot be said for the lines beyond the city. The StStZ routinely closed any out-of-city lines belonging to the companies it took over.<ref name=zacait/> In other cases, private sector operated lines succumbed without StStZ involvement. Out of town closures included:\n\n* The Schlieren to Dietikon and Schlieren to Weinigen lines of the LSB company, closed in 1928 and 1931 respectively.<ref name=tmblsb/> \n* The Oerlikon to Schwamendingen and Seebach to Glattbrugg lines of the ZOS company, closed in 1931.<ref name=tmbzos/> \n* The Uster to Langholz line of the UOeB company, closed in 1949.<ref name=ebuoeb/>\n* The Wetzikon to Meilen line of the WMB company, closed in 1950.<ref name=ebwmb/>\n\nIn the city, the initial threat to the tram came from its perceived inflexibility and susceptibility to the growing traffic congestion in the city streets. One proposed solution was the conversion of the less busy lines to trolleybus routes, and the first step in this direction was the conversion of tram route 1, from Burgwies to Hardplatz (1954-1956). This was followed by the Farbhof to Schlieren section of route 2 (1956-8) which became a westward extension of the same trolleybus route. In practice, the trolleybus service struggled to cope with peak loadings and punctuality did not improve. No further conversions of tram routes to trollrybuses have taken place.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Underground proposals===\n[[File:No. 7 Tram, Parade Platz.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of ''Mirage'' trams at Paradeplatz, operating on the surface where they were originally intended to be underground]]\nIn the 1950s, as well as proposing the conversion of less busy lines to trolleybus, plans were also made to place the busier lines in tunnel, in a form called the ''Tiefbahn''. The recently delivered Swiss Standard trams were not seen as suitable for this, because they had doors on their tapered car ends that would not have aligned with the proposed underground station platforms. In order to overcome this limitation, several new designs of tram were introduced. The first design, known as the P16 or ''Karpfen'', could not run on some existing routes, and only one batch of 15 motor tram and trailer pairs was built. A later design, which used articulation to avoid the problems of the P16, was eventually more successful and 126 vehicles were delivered by 1969. This car became popularly known as the ''Mirage''.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nDespite the planning and new rolling stock, a [[referendum]] in 1962 rejected the ''Tiefbahn''. However the proponents of going underground instead proposed a full scale [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]], the [[Z\u00fcrich U-Bahn]] system. This would have been standard gauge and electrified using a third rail, and hence incompatible with the tram system. The lines would have extended further into the suburbs and provided faster transit times than the tramways, which would have been curtailed so as not to compete with the U-Bahn. However this would have been at the expense of a coarser grained network, with much longer distances between U-Bahn stations than between the tram stops they replaced.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1973, the U-Bahn proposal too was rejected in a referendum, but not before several stretches of U-Bahn tunnel had been built. One section of the putative U-Bahn has since been adapted, as described below, for use by trams, whilst another now forms the terminus of the [[Uetliberg railway line|Uetliberg]] and [[Sihltal railway line|Sihltal]] railway lines under the [[Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof|Hauptbahnhof]].<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Extensions and a new model===\n[[File:Zurich Be 4-6 Tram 2000 2075 Waldgarten.jpg|thumb|left|Tram 2000 tram at Waldgarten stop in the tunnel section built for the U-Bahn]]\nIn 1976, the first tram extension since 1954 took place, with the extension of route 4 from Hardturm to [[Werdh\u00f6lzli]]. Unlike the older lines, this extension was built mostly on reserved track, a precedent to be followed by most subsequent extensions.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nThe Werdh\u00f6lzli extension was followed in 1986 by the extension of routes 7 and 9 into new residential areas to the north-east of Z\u00fcrich. This used one of the stretches of tunnel that had been built for the rejected U-Bahn, between Milchbuck and Schwamendingen. The tram route was extended through the tunnel before splitting at Schwamendingen to serve the area beyond, using new surface track. Because the tunnels and stations had been built with [[island platform]]s, whilst Z\u00fcrich trams only have doors on their [[Right- and left-hand traffic#Terminology|nearside]], the section through the tunnel uses left-hand running.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nFrom 1976 onwards, the VBZ tram fleet was further updated, with the introduction of Z\u00fcrich's variant of the [[Tram 2000|Tram 2000 design]] used by several Swiss tram systems. Several sub-classes of the Tram 2000 were purchased, including articulated and non-articulated variants, and some without drivers cabs that could only operate in multiple with other cars. Eventually 171 of these vehicles were delivered, with the last of the class delivered in 1992.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFrom the 1980s onwards, the system was increasingly acclaimed for its success in maintaining a high share of the [[modal split]], and the [[Z\u00fcrich model]] of transport provision was named after it. Beyond the tramway, the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn rail network]] was introduced to serve the region beyond the city boundaries, taking on some of the role that was originally planned for the U-Bahn. In 1990, the city's urban and regional transport were integrated by the introduction of the [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund|ZVV]] and its zone-based common fare structure.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n=== Low floors and the Glattalbahn ===\n[[File:Zurich Be 5-6 Cobra 3002 Letzistrasse.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Cobra (tram)|Bombardier Cobra]] low-floor tram on typical VBZ street track]]\nIn 2001, the VBZ took delivery of the first prototypes of a brand-new low-floor design of tram, known as the [[Cobra (tram)|Cobra]].<ref name=vbzfafch/> Despite many teething problems with the prototypes, which were eventually extensively rebuilt, there are now 88 of these trams in service, with the last delivered in 2010. In order to increase the number of low-floor trams in service, 23 trams from the otherwise high-floor Tram 2000 fleet were rebuilt between 2001 and 2005 with the addition of a low-floor centre section.\n\n[[File:Glatttalbahn - \u00d6rlikerhaus 2011-08-22 19-33-44.JPG|thumb|left|The Glattalbahn]]\nFrom the 1950s onwards, the [[Glattal]] region to the north of Z\u00fcrich experienced a rapid boom as population and industry spilled over from nearby Z\u00fcrich, partly driven by the presence of [[Z\u00fcrich Airport]]. Whilst the airport is served by the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|city's S-Bahn rail network]], the economic growth and resulting congestion led to a need for a finer-grained form of public transport. The responsible transport authority (the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Glattal]] or VBG) responded by constructing a new light rail system, the [[Stadtbahn Glattal|Glattalbahn]]. This was built to be compatible with Z\u00fcrich's tram network, with which it connects at several points on the city boundary. The system opened in stages between 2006 and 2010. The VBG contracted the VBZ to operate the network, and several tram routes now operate across both networks.<ref name=gpw/><ref name=saw/><ref name=tuthhqlr>{{cite news | first = C.J. | last = Wansbeek | title = Glattal: High quality light rail to Z\u00fcrich airport | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 374\u2013376 | date = October 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of new trams between 2001 and 2010 led to the departure of older vehicles.

In the city centre the tram tracks run through largely pedestrianised streets, and in one place in the suburbs the trams use a tunnel originally constructed for the never completed [[Z\u00fcrich U-Bahn]] system.

Z\u00fcrich's trams are single-ended, with doors on only one side, although Forchbahn trains are double-ended and double-sided.

All tram stops are equipped with ticket machines, and passengers are required to purchase a ticket before boarding the vehicle. Passengers may board through any door and are not required to show tickets on boarding. Instead, tickets are randomly checked by roving teams of fare inspectors, and fines are imposed on passengers found without one.<ref name=vbzatm>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/tickets/fare_zone_system.html | title = VBZ - Automatic ticket machine | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-05-21}}</ref>\n\nTram services are operated within the fare and ticketing system provided by the cantonal public transport authority, the [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund]] (ZVV). This system covers the whole of the [[canton of Z\u00fcrich]] and thus covers travel on other modes and services, provided by many other operators, and includes the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn]] suburban rail network.

The Z\u00fcrich tram network extends over just two of these zones, with zone 110 covering the city routes, and zone 121 covering the Stadtbahn Glattal routes.

By 2010, it had conducted trials of three existing tram types on its network. These were the [[Stadler Tango]], the [[Siemens Combino]] and the [[Bombardier Flexity]]. It then requested tenders for the supply of 30 new trams, together with an option for the supply of a further 70 vehicles. The first trams were to be delivered in December 2016, and were to be 100% low floor with capacity for at least 225 passengers. In response, by April 2013 five suppliers had submitted bids.

Both [[Stadler Rail]] and [[Siemens]] filed complaints with the [[Administrative Court of the Canton of Z\u00fcrich]], causing the finalisation of the contract to be suspended, but the court ruled in February 2017 that VBZ could conclude the contract with Bombardier. After both Stadler and Siemens decided not to appeal this decision to the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]], the contract was finally signed on 2 March 2017.

The [[tram]] network serves most city neighbourhoods, and is the backbone of public transport within the city, albeit supplemented by the inner sections of the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn]], along with urban [[trolleybus]] and [[bus]] routes as well as two [[funicular]] railways and one [[rack railway]]. The trams and other city transport modes operate within a fare regime provided by the cantonal public transport authority [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund]] (ZVV), which also covers regional rail and bus services.<ref name=tutttctlr>{{cite news | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | title = Z\u00fcrich: Top city \u2014 thanks to light rail | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 130\u2013134 | date = April 2005}}</ref><ref name=tuttcraag>{{cite news | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | title =  Z\u00fcrich: The Cobra rules, all above ground | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 180\u2013184 | date = May 2005}}</ref><ref name=zacait>{{cite web |  first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/zurich05_0.html | title = Z\u00fcrich: A city and its trams | date = December 2005 | accessdate = 2011-08-10}}</ref>\n\nThe city's trams are operated by the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Z\u00fcrich]] (VBZ), which also manages the tramway infrastructure within the city, but the city's tram tracks are also used by two other operations.

Electrified from the 1890s, they have seen off challenges including proposals to replace them by [[trolleybuses]] and by a [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]] or [[U-Bahn]]. With a relatively static city network from the 1930s to the late 1970s, the city's trams have been expanding again since then. Recent expansions have taken the network into the suburbs beyond the city boundary, covering areas it retreated from in the first part of the 20th century. Further extensions have been approved, both to the city tram network itself, and by the introduction of a [[Limmattal light rail line|new light rail system]] in the [[Limmat Valley]] that will interwork with the city trams.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings===\n[[File:R\u00f6sslitram.jpg|thumb|left|One of Z\u00fcrich's horse trams  in 1900]]\nVarious projects to introduce trams to Z\u00fcrich were proposed from the 1860s onwards. It was not until 1882, however, that the first tram operated in the city. These initial trams were operated by the {{ill|Z\u00fcrcher Strassenbahn Gesellschaft|de}} (ZStG), a private company, and were of [[standard gauge]] ({{RailGauge|sg|disp=or}} gauge) and horse-drawn.<ref name=vbzfafch>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | title = Facts & figures - Corporate history | publisher = VBZ | accessdate = 2012-05-26 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121007013822/http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | archivedate = 2012-10-07 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1888 the first electric tramway in Switzerland (the [[Vevey\u2013Montreux\u2013Chillon tramway]]) had opened, and, in 1894, another private company, the {{ill|Elektrische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich|de}} (EStZ), started operating [[metre gauge]] ({{RailGauge|1000mm|first=imp|disp=1}} gauge) electric trams in Z\u00fcrich. The EStZ only survived for two years before it was taken over by the City of Z\u00fcrich, who renamed it the [[St\u00e4dtische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich]] (StStZ). The following year, the horse trams of the ZStG were acquired.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFurther tramway companies were founded, some operating entirely within the city, some connecting the city with its nearer suburbs, and some running in rural areas entirely beyond the city, but still linked by connections with other lines to the city. Like the EStZ, all these lines were electrified and were built to the metre gauge. The StStZ gradually took over those companies that had significant city operations, usually closing any cross-boundary lines, whilst leaving those lines entirely beyond the city to their own devices.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Many companies===\n[[File:Zuercher Strassenbahnlinien um 1899.jpg|thumb|The mix of routes in 1899, distinguishing city owned (''Stadt'') and private (''Privat''), and horse (''Pferdebahn'') and electric (''elektrisch'')]]\nThe many companies that operated trams in and around Z\u00fcrich are summarised in the table below.

The line opened in 1912 as a rural tramway connecting at Rehalp with the city trams, with inter-running as far as the city centre. The line has since been rebuilt with more railway characteristics, and quite substantial trains, but these continue to operate across the city tram network between [[Z\u00fcrich Stadelhofen railway station|Stadelhofen]] in the city centre and Rehalp.\n|-\n|'''[[Verkehrsbetriebe Z\u00fcrich]]'''\n|VBZ\n|1950\n|\n|\n|Owned by city of Z\u00fcrich.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n|-\n|'''''[[BDWM Transport AG]]'''''\n|BDWM\n|2000\n|\n|\n|Created by amalgamation of the BD with the bus operator WM.

The standard gauge horse tram lines had all been converted to metre gauge and electrified. The StStZ had also built many tram extensions, resulting in a dense network of tramlines serving most city neighbourhoods.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nHowever, in 1927, the StStZ had introduced its first [[motor bus]] route, and this was to be followed in 1939 by the first of the [[Trolleybuses in Z\u00fcrich|city's trolleybus routes]]. Initially these modes complemented the trams, but at various times they have threatened to replace parts of the tram system, and sometimes succeeded in doing so.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1940, the StStZ started a modernisation of its trams, introducing the first prototypes of the {{ill|Swiss Standard Tram|de|Schweizer Standardwagen|fr|Tramway standard suisse}}. Despite Switzerland's neutrality, the economic effects of the [[second world war]] slowed down the program, but by 1953 the VBZ, as the StStZ had become in 1950, had taken delivery of 177 such trams.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Lines closed===\n[[File:Wetzikon Meilen Bahn Gr\u00fcningen.JPG|thumb|left|The WMB in Gr\u00fcningen, prior to 1950]]\nWhile the tram network within the city of Z\u00fcrich has seen relatively few line closures, the same cannot be said for the lines beyond the city. The StStZ routinely closed any out-of-city lines belonging to the companies it took over.<ref name=zacait/> In other cases, private sector operated lines succumbed without StStZ involvement. Out of town closures included:\n\n* The Schlieren to Dietikon and Schlieren to Weinigen lines of the LSB company, closed in 1928 and 1931 respectively.<ref name=tmblsb/> \n* The Oerlikon to Schwamendingen and Seebach to Glattbrugg lines of the ZOS company, closed in 1931.<ref name=tmbzos/> \n* The Uster to Langholz line of the UOeB company, closed in 1949.<ref name=ebuoeb/>\n* The Wetzikon to Meilen line of the WMB company, closed in 1950.<ref name=ebwmb/>\n\nIn the city, the initial threat to the tram came from its perceived inflexibility and susceptibility to the growing traffic congestion in the city streets. One proposed solution was the conversion of the less busy lines to trolleybus routes, and the first step in this direction was the conversion of tram route 1, from Burgwies to Hardplatz (1954-1956). This was followed by the Farbhof to Schlieren section of route 2 (1956-8) which became a westward extension of the same trolleybus route. In practice, the trolleybus service struggled to cope with peak loadings and punctuality did not improve. No further conversions of tram routes to trollrybuses have taken place.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Underground proposals===\n[[File:No. 7 Tram, Parade Platz.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of ''Mirage'' trams at Paradeplatz, operating on the surface where they were originally intended to be underground]]\nIn the 1950s, as well as proposing the conversion of less busy lines to trolleybus, plans were also made to place the busier lines in tunnel, in a form called the ''Tiefbahn''. The recently delivered Swiss Standard trams were not seen as suitable for this, because they had doors on their tapered car ends that would not have aligned with the proposed underground station platforms. In order to overcome this limitation, several new designs of tram were introduced. The first design, known as the P16 or ''Karpfen'', could not run on some existing routes, and only one batch of 15 motor tram and trailer pairs was built. A later design, which used articulation to avoid the problems of the P16, was eventually more successful and 126 vehicles were delivered by 1969. This car became popularly known as the ''Mirage''.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nDespite the planning and new rolling stock, a [[referendum]] in 1962 rejected the ''Tiefbahn''. However the proponents of going underground instead proposed a full scale [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]], the [[Z\u00fcrich U-Bahn]] system. This would have been standard gauge and electrified using a third rail, and hence incompatible with the tram system. The lines would have extended further into the suburbs and provided faster transit times than the tramways, which would have been curtailed so as not to compete with the U-Bahn. However this would have been at the expense of a coarser grained network, with much longer distances between U-Bahn stations than between the tram stops they replaced.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1973, the U-Bahn proposal too was rejected in a referendum, but not before several stretches of U-Bahn tunnel had been built. One section of the putative U-Bahn has since been adapted, as described below, for use by trams, whilst another now forms the terminus of the [[Uetliberg railway line|Uetliberg]] and [[Sihltal railway line|Sihltal]] railway lines under the [[Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof|Hauptbahnhof]].<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Extensions and a new model===\n[[File:Zurich Be 4-6 Tram 2000 2075 Waldgarten.jpg|thumb|left|Tram 2000 tram at Waldgarten stop in the tunnel section built for the U-Bahn]]\nIn 1976, the first tram extension since 1954 took place, with the extension of route 4 from Hardturm to [[Werdh\u00f6lzli]]. Unlike the older lines, this extension was built mostly on reserved track, a precedent to be followed by most subsequent extensions.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nThe Werdh\u00f6lzli extension was followed in 1986 by the extension of routes 7 and 9 into new residential areas to the north-east of Z\u00fcrich. This used one of the stretches of tunnel that had been built for the rejected U-Bahn, between Milchbuck and Schwamendingen. The tram route was extended through the tunnel before splitting at Schwamendingen to serve the area beyond, using new surface track. Because the tunnels and stations had been built with [[island platform]]s, whilst Z\u00fcrich trams only have doors on their [[Right- and left-hand traffic#Terminology|nearside]], the section through the tunnel uses left-hand running.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nFrom 1976 onwards, the VBZ tram fleet was further updated, with the introduction of Z\u00fcrich's variant of the [[Tram 2000|Tram 2000 design]] used by several Swiss tram systems. Several sub-classes of the Tram 2000 were purchased, including articulated and non-articulated variants, and some without drivers cabs that could only operate in multiple with other cars. Eventually 171 of these vehicles were delivered, with the last of the class delivered in 1992.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFrom the 1980s onwards, the system was increasingly acclaimed for its success in maintaining a high share of the [[modal split]], and the [[Z\u00fcrich model]] of transport provision was named after it. Beyond the tramway, the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn rail network]] was introduced to serve the region beyond the city boundaries, taking on some of the role that was originally planned for the U-Bahn. In 1990, the city's urban and regional transport were integrated by the introduction of the [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund|ZVV]] and its zone-based common fare structure.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n=== Low floors and the Glattalbahn ===\n[[File:Zurich Be 5-6 Cobra 3002 Letzistrasse.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Cobra (tram)|Bombardier Cobra]] low-floor tram on typical VBZ street track]]\nIn 2001, the VBZ took delivery of the first prototypes of a brand-new low-floor design of tram, known as the [[Cobra (tram)|Cobra]].<ref name=vbzfafch/> Despite many teething problems with the prototypes, which were eventually extensively rebuilt, there are now 88 of these trams in service, with the last delivered in 2010. In order to increase the number of low-floor trams in service, 23 trams from the otherwise high-floor Tram 2000 fleet were rebuilt between 2001 and 2005 with the addition of a low-floor centre section.\n\n[[File:Glatttalbahn - \u00d6rlikerhaus 2011-08-22 19-33-44.JPG|thumb|left|The Glattalbahn]]\nFrom the 1950s onwards, the [[Glattal]] region to the north of Z\u00fcrich experienced a rapid boom as population and industry spilled over from nearby Z\u00fcrich, partly driven by the presence of [[Z\u00fcrich Airport]]. Whilst the airport is served by the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|city's S-Bahn rail network]], the economic growth and resulting congestion led to a need for a finer-grained form of public transport. The responsible transport authority (the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Glattal]] or VBG) responded by constructing a new light rail system, the [[Stadtbahn Glattal|Glattalbahn]]. This was built to be compatible with Z\u00fcrich's tram network, with which it connects at several points on the city boundary. The system opened in stages between 2006 and 2010. The VBG contracted the VBZ to operate the network, and several tram routes now operate across both networks.<ref name=gpw/><ref name=saw/><ref name=tuthhqlr>{{cite news | first = C.J. | last = Wansbeek | title = Glattal: High quality light rail to Z\u00fcrich airport | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 374\u2013376 | date = October 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of new trams between 2001 and 2010 led to the departure of older vehicles. The ''Karpfen'' last ran in regular service in 2006, and the ''Mirage'' in 2010.

Beyond Rehalp the trains use the FB's own segregated tracks to reach their outer terminus at [[Esslingen, Switzerland|Esslingen]].<ref name=gpw/><ref name=saw/>\n\nOn the last weekend of each month, the [[Z\u00fcrich Tram Museum]] operates tram route 21 from the city centre to the museum at Burgwies (up to Rehalp at Saturdays), using their own heritage rolling stock.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tram-museum.ch/content.php?id=5&lang=en | title = The Museum Line 21 | publisher = Z\u00fcrich Tram Museum | accessdate=2012-05-09}}</ref>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Infrastructure===\n[[File:Z\u00fcrich - Stadelhoferplatz IMG 4441.JPG|thumb|Raised platforms for use with low-floor trams, being used by a high-floor tram]]\nZ\u00fcrich's tram network is built to [[metre gauge]] ({{RailGauge|1000mm|first=imp|disp=1}} gauge). There are {{convert|171.9|km|mi}} of track, equating to a network length of {{convert|72.9|km|mi}} and a total route length of {{convert|118.7|km|mi}}. The tracks are electrified using [[overhead line]] at 600 [[Volt|V]] [[Direct current|DC]], utilising a supply system shared with the [[Trolleybuses in Z\u00fcrich|city's trolleybus network]].<ref name=\"figures\">{{cite web |url=https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/de/index/die_vbz/portraet/zahlen_fakten/linien.html |title=Startseite VBZ - Die VBZ - Portr\u00e4t - Zahlen & Fakten - Linien |publisher=Stadt Z\u00fcrich [City of Z\u00fcrich] |language=German |trans-title=Home VBZ - VBZ - Portrait - Facts & Figures - Lines |date= |accessdate=2014-05-25}}</ref><ref name=saw/>\n\nThe VBZ infrastructure within Z\u00fcrich is largely street based, with varying degrees of segregation from other street traffic and significant sections where trams run in unrestricted traffic lanes. In the city centre the tram tracks run through largely pedestrianised streets, and in one place in the suburbs the trams use a tunnel originally constructed for the never completed [[Z\u00fcrich U-Bahn]] system. By contrast, on VBG infrastructure in the Stadtbahn Glattal, VBZ trams operate on long stretches of dedicated track.<ref name=gpw>{{cite web | title = Gleisplan - Stra\u00dfenbahn Z\u00fcrich mit Glattal |  url = http://www.gleisplanweb.eu/Maps/Zuerich.pdf | language = German | trans-title = Trackplan - Z\u00fcrich with Glattal | date = 2014-01-23 | accessdate = 2014-06-21}}</ref><ref name=saw/>\n\nMany of Z\u00fcrich's tram stops have been equipped with boarding platforms raised to match the floor height of the low floor trams, although there are still examples of stops where passengers must board from street level. Z\u00fcrich's trams are single-ended, with doors on only one side, although Forchbahn trains are double-ended and double-sided. In consequence all terminal locations are equipped with [[turning loop]]s, and all tram stops are to the [[Right- and left-hand traffic#Terminology|nearside]] of the tram.<ref name=gpw/>\n\n===Depots and workshops===\n[[File:Tramdepot Zuerich 1911 Friedrich Fissler.jpg|thumb|left|The tram depot at Hard was built in 1911]]\nZ\u00fcrich's tram fleet is kept in the five operational depots of Hard, Irchel, Kalkbreite, Oerlikon and  Wollishofen, together with a permanent way yard at Hardturm. Whilst these depots have the capability to undertake minor maintenance, heavier maintenance is the responsibility of the VBZ's central workshop at Altstetten. This is connected to the tram network, and also has a rail connection to the [[Swiss Federal Railway]] system, allowing the delivery of infrastructure items and vehicles by rail.<ref name=gpw/><ref name=zws>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/de/index/produkte_dienstleistungen/werkstatt.html | title = Werkstatt | language = German | trans-title = Workshop | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-02-17}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the above depots and workshops, two other former tram depots, at Burgweis and Wartau, are also still connected to the tram network. Burgweis depot now houses the [[Tram-Museum Z\u00fcrich]] main collection, whilst Wartau is used as a workshop by that organisation. The rail connections permit the occasional operation of preserved trams on the VBZ network.<ref name=gpw/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Tram fleet===\nAs of 2012, the VBZ owns 313 tram vehicles, which between them cover over 16 million vehicle-kilometres per year. All regular public services are covered by 289 vehicles of two basic classes, with the remainder of the fleet made up of a number of assorted works vehicles, including some used for the cargo tram service, and heritage vehicles.

All tram stops are equipped with ticket machines, and passengers are required to purchase a ticket before boarding the vehicle. Passengers may board through any door and are not required to show tickets on boarding. Instead, tickets are randomly checked by roving teams of fare inspectors, and fines are imposed on passengers found without one.<ref name=vbzatm>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/tickets/fare_zone_system.html | title = VBZ - Automatic ticket machine | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-05-21}}</ref>\n\nTram services are operated within the fare and ticketing system provided by the cantonal public transport authority, the [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund]] (ZVV). This system covers the whole of the [[canton of Z\u00fcrich]] and thus covers travel on other modes and services, provided by many other operators, and includes the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn]] suburban rail network. Free transfer is permitted between different vehicles, routes, modes and operators, provided a ticket valid for the whole journey is held.<ref name=vbzfzs>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/tickets/fare_zone_system.html | title = VBZ - Fare zone system | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-05-21}}</ref>\n\nThe ZVV system is zone-based, with fares for individual journeys set by the zones the journey passes through. The Z\u00fcrich tram network extends over just two of these zones, with zone 110 covering the city routes, and zone 121 covering the Stadtbahn Glattal routes. Both single journey and day tickets are available, as are a number of passes with longer validities.<ref name=vbzfzs/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.zvv.ch/export/sites/default/common-images/content-image-gallery/linien-zonen-pdfs/Tarifzonen_Kanton_Zuerich_2011.pdf | title = Tarifzonen - Fare zones | publisher = ZVV | accessdate = 2012-06-18}}</ref>\n\n===Cargo tram===\n[[File:Cargo Tram outside Zurich Hauptbahnhof.JPG|thumb|left|The cargo tram]]\nBesides its passenger transport activities, VBZ, jointly with the city refuse and recycling department ERZ, operates the cargo tram to collect bulky waste. The cargo tram serves 10 different collection points around Z\u00fcrich, calling at each on different days of the month. The collected refuse is taken to a specially constructed siding at the ERZ yard adjacent to the Werdh\u00f6lzli tram terminus.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/de/index/produkte_dienstleistungen/cargo_tram_und_etram.html | title = Cargo- und E-Tram | language = German | trans-title = Cargo- and E-Tram | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-05-09 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120829085657/http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/de/index/produkte_dienstleistungen/cargo_tram_und_etram.html | archivedate = 2012-08-29 }}</ref><ref name=amcargo>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/cargotram.html | title = Cargotram -  Z\u00fcrich's domestic refuse takes to the rails | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | date = August 2003 | accessdate = 2013-07-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2014&item=140114 | title = Cargotram serves additional destination | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | date = 2014-01-14 | accessdate = 2014-02-06}}</ref>\n\nThe service was introduced in 2003, as an attempt to reduce the amount of bulky waste items dumped illegally every year.

By 2010, it had conducted trials of three existing tram types on its network. These were the [[Stadler Tango]], the [[Siemens Combino]] and the [[Bombardier Flexity]]. It then requested tenders for the supply of 30 new trams, together with an option for the supply of a further 70 vehicles. The first trams were to be delivered in December 2016, and were to be 100% low floor with capacity for at least 225 passengers. In response, by April 2013 five suppliers had submitted bids. As of February 2015, no decision had been made as to which supplier to select, with reports of conflict between city and canton authorities.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?item=210610a | title = Tango, Combino or Flexity? | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = June 2010 | accessdate = 2013-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?item=201112 | title = New tram order: The ball is rolling | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = November 2012 | accessdate = 2013-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2013&item=080413 | title = Five suppliers vie for tram contract | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = April 2013 | accessdate = 2013-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2015&item=260215 | title = More gloom over tram order | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = February 2015 | accessdate = 2015-03-02}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2016, it was announced that VBZ had awarded a contract worth 358 million [[Swiss Franc]]s to [[Bombardier Transportation]] for the supply of 70<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/tram-zuerich-flexity-kommt-erst-im-sommer-2020-zum-einsatz-ld.1524125 | title = Das erste Flexity-Tram kurvt durch Z\u00fcrich \u2013 aber Passagiere d\u00fcrfen noch lange nicht mitfahren | language = German |  work =  Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung | date = 25 November 2019 | accessdate = 25 November 2019}}</ref> 7-section [[Flexity 2]] trams, with an option for a further 70, to be delivered between 2018 and 2023.

At its renaming as a Royal Corps in 1918 it was both a supply and repair corps.  In the supply area it had responsibility for weapons, armoured vehicles and other military equipment, ammunition and clothing and certain minor functions such as laundry, mobile baths and photography. The RAOC was also responsible for a major element of the repair of Army equipment.  In 1942 the latter function was transferred to the [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]] (REME) and the vehicle storage and spares responsibilities of the [[Royal Army Service Corps]] were in turn passed over to the RAOC.  The RAOC retained repair responsibilities for ammunition, clothing and certain ranges of general stores.  In 1964 the [[McLeod Reorganisation of Army Logistics]] resulted in the RAOC absorbing petroleum, rations and accommodation stores functions from the Royal Army Service Corps as well as the [[Army Fire Service]], barrack services, sponsorship of [[NAAFI]] (EFI) and the management of [[staff clerk]]s from the same Corps.  On 5 April 1993, the RAOC was one of the corps that amalgamated to form The [[Royal Logistic Corps]] (RLC).\n\nThe permanent establishment of an [[Ordnance Office]] long predated that of a [[standing army]] in Britain; it has therefore been claimed that 'in a wide sense, as heirs to the master-[[bowyers]], master-[[Fletcher (occupation)|fletchers]], master-[[carpenters]] and master-[[Metalsmith|smiths]] who, in mediaeval days, were responsible as Officers of Ordnance for the care and provision of warlike mat\u00e9riel, and to their successors the storekeepers, [[clerk]]s, [[Armed-forces artificer|artificers]], [[armourers]] and [[Storeman|storemen]] of the Board of Ordnance, the R.A.O.C. can claim a far longer continuous history and more ancient lineage than any other unit of the British Army'.<ref name=\"Forbes1929\">{{cite book |last1=Forbes |first1=Major General A. |title=The History of the Army Ordnance Services, vol.

Thereafter followed thirty years of fluctuating allocation of responsibilities and a great variety of titles of both corps and individuals. This complex, convoluted and largely unsatisfactory period insofar as Army logistics was concerned was summarised in 1889 as follows: \n{{quote|'The English Ordnance Department goes back into an older history than the Army.

The Storekeeper's department, on the other hand, was part of the [[Civilian|civil]] establishment, though (as with much of the Board's activity) troops were involved in various aspects of its operation when not [[Military deployment|deployed]] elsewhere.<ref name=\"Hogg1963\" /> In any case, modern distinctions between civilian and military personnel were not so clear cut for those serving under the Board: its officers, [[military engineers|engineers]] and [[artillerymen]] received their commissions or patents from the [[Master-General of the Ordnance]], as did the Storekeepers, artificers and storemen. Though civilians, the Storekeepers were provided with uniform, akin to that of the Royal Artillery, described in 1833 as a blue coat with red stand-collar and cuffs, gold [[epaulettes]] indicating rank and blue trousers with a gold stripe, worn with a gold-[[Hilt|hilted]] sword and a [[cocked hat]]; Clerks on the establishment wore the same uniform but without epaulettes. After [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] they were given relative rank (for the purpose of allotting appropriate quarters): Storekeepers to rank as lieutenant colonel, Deputy Storekeepers as major (if in independent charge) or else captain, Assistant Storekeepers as lieutenant and Clerks as a non-commissioned officer.<ref name=\"Forbes1929\" /> The Storekeepers and their Deputies had oversight of the [[Board of Ordnance#Storage and supply: the Ordnance Yards|Ordnance Yards]], both at home and abroad, however they were never deployed in the [[theatre of war]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/royal-naval-dockyard-staff/|title=Royal Naval dockyard staff|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Field Train Department of the Board of Ordnance====\nBy the mid-eighteenth century, Woolwich Warren (the future [[Royal Arsenal]]) had outgrown the [[Tower of London]] as the main ordnance storage depot in the realm.<ref name=Hogg1963>{{cite book |last=Hogg |first=Brigadier O.F.G. |year=1963 |title=The Royal Arsenal Woolwich |volume=Volume I |location=London |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}\n</ref> In times of war, the Board of Ordnance Storekeepers found themselves responsible for conveying guns, ammunition and certain other items to the troops [[Field of battle|in the field]] (whereas provision of food, supplies and other equipment was largely dependent on the [[Commissariat]], a department of [[HM Treasury]]). Until 1792, the transport and issue of weapons and ammunition to troops in the [[theatre of war]] was achieved by the formation of [[artillery train]]s, as and where required. In that year, with Britain about to engage in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], the Board sought to place this ''ad hoc'' arrangement on a permanent footing by establishing a '''Field Train Department'''. A Lieutenant-General of the Royal Artillery served as its Commandant and a Major-General as his Deputy, but otherwise its personnel were uniformed civilians: under a Senior [[Commissary]] based at Woolwich were Commissaries, Assistant Commissaries, Clerks of Stores and Conductors of Stores (equivalent to [[Major]]s, [[Captain (Army)|Captains]], [[subalterns]] and [[NCOs]] respectively).<ref name=\"Sharpe1993\" /> In peace time nothing more than a small [[Cadre (military)|cadre]] of officers was maintained (at the headquarters in Woolwich), but in time of war they were supplemented by recruits from the Ordnance Storekeeper's department to serve in the field; thus the strength of the Department varied dramatically, from 4 or 5 (during the peaceful years 1828-1853) to 346 at its peak in 1813. Each recruit received special training in the handling of munitions. During the Crimean War a number of Sergeants were seconded from the Royal Artillery to serve as [[Conductor (military appointment)|Military Conductors]] in addition to the civilian staff.<ref name=\"Steer 2005\">{{cite book |last1=Steer |first1=Brigadier Frank |title=To The Warrior His Arms: the story of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps 1918-1993 |date=2005 |publisher=Pen & Sword |location=Barnsley, S. Yorks}}</ref>\n\nWith regard to the Royal Artillery and the Royal Engineers, the Field Train Department had additional responsibilities: it provided them with pay, clothing, medical supplies and camp equipment when deployed (while the Commissariat provided their food and [[forage]]).<ref name=\"Sharpe1993\">{{cite book |last1=Sharpe |first1=L. C. |title=The Field Train Department of the Board of Ordnance |date=1993 |publisher=Royal Logistic Corps museum}}</ref> The Field Train Department provided the Royal Engineers with their [[pontoon bridge]]s and other specialist equipment, and (until the formation of a separate Corps of Artillery Drivers) provided for the movement of [[artillery piece]]s in the field (other than those pertaining to the [[Royal Horse Artillery]]). For the duration of conflict the Department's personnel accompanied the Artillery and Engineer units in the field providing them with logistic support (including repair facilities).<ref name=\"Sharpe1993\" />\n\nBetween 1795 and 1815, the Field Train served in thirty expeditions and campaigns.<ref name=\"Steer 2005\"/> In peacetime, the civilians and sergeants returned to their former duties, but the cadre of officers was retained; they were based initially in the Royal Arsenal, and then in the [[Royal Artillery Barracks#Related institutions in Woolwich|Grand Depot]] (just off [[Woolwich Common]]) where the guns were stored ready for deployment. At the start of the Crimean War, the Ordnance Field Train was [[mobilized]] once again. An parallel supply corps within the Army (the [[Royal Waggon Train]], first established in 1794) had been disbanded as a cost-cutting measure in 1833, however, and its responsibilities devolved again to the Commissariat (which was by now more attuned to peacetime operations than warfare);<ref name=\"Steer 2005\"/> after a well-publicised series of logistical failings the Commissariat and the Board of Ordnance, as well as the command-structure of the army itself, were all strongly criticised, leading (among other things) to the abolition of the Board (in 1855) and its Field Train Department (in 1859, its officers having transferred to the new Military Store Department).<ref name=\"Sharpe1993\" />\n\n===After Crimea===\nIn the years following the Crimean War three corps can be identified as the direct predecessors of the RAOC.  The '''Military Store Department''' (MSD) created in 1861 granted military commissions and provided officers to manage stores inventories.  In parallel a subordinate corps of warrant officers and sergeants, the '''Military Store Clerks Corps''' (MSC), was also created to carry out clerical duties.  These small corps (235 officers in the MSD and 44 MSC) were based largely at the [[Tower of London]], [[Royal Arsenal|Woolwich Arsenal]] and [[Weedon Bec]], but were also deployable on active service. They were supplemented in 1865 by the establishment at Woolwich of a '''Military Store Staff Corps'''  (MSSC) to provide soldiers:<ref>HED Harris ' the First Five Hundred Years', RAOC School, Blackdown 1962. pp65-67</ref> initially 200-strong, it had more than doubled in size by 1869, with units in Portsmouth, Devonport, Aldershot, Dublin and Chatham as well as at Woolwich and the Tower.<ref name=\"Forbes1929\" />\n\nIn 1870 a further reorganisation, ostensibly to simplify management, resulted in the MSD, MSC and MSSC being grouped with the [[Royal Army Service Corps|Army Service Corps]] (ASC) under the [[Control Department]].  The officers remained a separate branch (Ordnance or Military Stores) in the Control Department but the soldiers were absorbed into the ASC.  This arrangement lasted until 1876.<ref>Major General A Forbes 'A History of Army Ordnance Services', Medici Society, London 1929. Vol II pp 151-152</ref>\n\nThe Control Department was disbanded in 1876.  The Ordnance/Military Store officers joined a newly created '''Ordnance Stores Department''' (OSD).  Five years later, in 1881, the soldiers also left the ASC and became the '''Ordnance Store Corps''' (OSC).  In 1894 there were further changes.  The OSD was retitled the '''Army Ordnance Department''' (AOD) and absorbed the Inspectors of Machinery from the [[Royal Artillery]] (RA).  In parallel the OSC was retitled the '''Army Ordnance Corps''' (AOC) and at the same time absorbed the Corps of Armourers and the RA's Armament Artificers.<ref>Major General A Forbes 'A History of the Army Ordnance Services' Medici Society, London 1929. Vol II pp 153-5</ref>\n\nIn 1918 the AOD and AOC amalgamated to form the Royal Army Ordnance Corps and for the first time officers and soldiers served in the same organisation; it received the \"Royal\" prefix in recognition of their service during the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1922.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nam.ac.uk/explore/royal-army-ordnance-corps|title=Royal Army Ordnance Corps|publisher=National Army Museum|accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Ordnance Services Organisation before 1914==\n[[File:Greenwich Heritage Centre, Woolwich - RA & RMA exhibition 26 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Red Barracks, Woolwich]]\n===Depots and other installations===\nThe earliest depot for military stores was the [[Tower of London]], headquarters of the [[Ordnance Office]], which for many centuries sufficed to hold the country's central stocks of artillery, gunpowder, small arms and ammunition albeit in unsatisfactory circumstances. The Tower continued to be used for storage into the 19th century, but in 1671 the Board of Ordnance acquired a parcel of land at [[Woolwich]] which soon supplanted the Tower to become the Board's main ordnance storage depot; manufacture as well as storage of guns and ammunition took place on the site, which was later named the [[Royal Arsenal]]. In 1760 the Royal Gunpowder Magazine was established at [[Purfleet]], replacing the Tower as Britain's central repository of gunpowder. In 1808 a modern purpose-built depot was constructed at [[Weedon Bec|Weedon]], alongside the Grand Union Canal, to serve as a safe repository for guns and ammunition;<ref>Major General A Forbes 'A History of the Army Ordnance Services' Medici Society, London 1929. Vol I. p192</ref> and in 1813 a new Grand Storehouse was opened in the Royal Arsenal, containing multiple warehouses for all kinds of military stores. When [[Woolwich Dockyard]] closed in 1869, the entire dockyard site was taken over by the War Office to become a vast ordnance stores complex, annexed (and [[Royal Arsenal Railway|linked by rail]]) to the ordnance stores in the Royal Arsenal; large stocks of barrack stores, [[Horse harness|harnesses]], [[accoutrements]] and other general stores were transferred to Woolwich Dockyard from the Tower at this time. At the same time the Military Store Department moved its headquarters from the Tower to the Red Fort at Woolwich (which had originally been built as the infirmary for the adjacent [[Royal Marine Barracks, Woolwich|Royal Marine Barracks]], linked to the nearby Dockyard);<ref>{{cite book|last1=Semark|first1=H.W.|title=The Royal Naval Armament Depots of Priddy's Hard, Elson, Frater and Bedenham, 1768\u20131977|date=1997|publisher=Hampshire County Council|location=Winchester|page=124}}</ref> as [[Royal Marine Barracks, Woolwich#Red Barracks|Red Barracks]], it would continue to serve as the [[Regimental depot|regimental Depot]], headquarters and home of the ordnance corps for the next fifty years. Finally, by about 1887, large stocks of small arms were moved from the Tower of London to Weedon, leaving the Tower to serve as a repository of ancient arms and armour and as a small Ordnance centre for troops in London.<ref name=\"Forbes1929\" />  \n\n[[File:Selby, Old MOD Ordnance Depot - geograph.org.uk - 159590.jpg|thumb|right|The former [[Barlby]] Ordnance Depot, dating from 1889 (one of a number of small depots established at that time).]]\nIn addition to these central depots, ordnance yards in the naval and garrison towns of [[Chatham Dockyard#The Gun Wharf|Chatham]], [[Gunwharf Quays|Portsmouth]] and [[HMNB Devonport#Morice Yard (New Gun Wharf)|Plymouth]] held reserve stocks of camp equipment, entrenching tools, small-arms and ammunition, accoutrements, harness and saddlery (similar stores were also provided at Dublin, Gibraltar and Malta). During the Crimean War, however, these arrangements proved unequal to the task of equipping an army with speed at a time of [[mobilization]]. After the war an Ordnance station was established as part of the new training camp at [[Aldershot Garrison|Aldershot]]: a hutted encampment was provided for troops to practise combined training, alongside a depot to furnish them with field stores.<ref name=\"Forbes1929\" /> In the 1880s an effort was made to decentralise the reserves of equipment; as many as sixty-two small regional centres were set up, in an effort to bring stores closer to the units that would use them. Later, with the establishment of larger camps and garrisons in the early 20th century, these were consolidated into eighteen larger Ordnance stations. At the same time, during the period from the 1860s to 1914, various depots were established to support the Army throughout the world (with the notable exception of India where the Indian Army managed its own parallel organisation in [[Ordnance Depot Quetta, Rawalpindi and Karachi]] (then British India and now Pakistan), the Indian Army Ordnance Corps (IAOC). In 1881 there were detachments in Dublin, [[Jersey]], [[Gibraltar]], [[Malta]], [[Bermuda]], [[Canada]], [[St Helena]], [[Cape Colony|Cape of Good Hope]], [[Mauritius]] and [[Straits Settlements]].

The [[Royal Army Clothing Depot]], Pimlico, closed in 1932 and its stock was mostly transferred to Didcot.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Roper |first1=Michael |title=The Records of the War Office and Related Departments, 1660-1964 |date=1998 |publisher=Public Record Office |location=Kew, Surrey |page=177}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s re-armament and the mechanisation of the Army led to a redesign of the UK base.  A Central Ordnance Depot (COD) and workshop to support vehicles, built on the site of the First World War [[National Shell Filling Factory, Chilwell]], opened in 1937.  The operation of this depot was notable in that it mirrored and tried to improve on best civilian practice at the time; this became a hallmark of RAOC development in the following decades. [[Branston Depot|COD Branston]] was established in 1938, initially to serve as the Army's main clothing store, freeing up space at COD Didcot. At the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] there were five CODs: Branston, Chilwell, Didcot, Weedon and Woolwich.<ref name=\"Steer 2005\" />\n\n[[File:Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) women working on a Churchill tank at a Royal Army Ordnance Corps depot, 10 October 1942.

Base Ordnance Depots (BOD) and Base Ammunition Depots (BAD) sprung up all over the world wherever a major line of communication was established.<ref>Brigadier AH Fernyhough 'A History of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps 1920-45' RAOC, Blackdown 1966 lists BODs in West Africa, the Middle East and South East Asia as well as France and Italy.</ref>\n\nMajor changes took place after 1942 when the REME absorbed most of the RAOC repair functions and the RAOC in turn took over the RASC's vehicle organisation.  The more mobile nature of the Second World War also led to the creation of units at divisional and corps level with higher levels of mobility.  The most notable of these was the ordnance field park, principally carrying vehicle and technical stores spares.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/royal-army-ordnance-corps/field-parks.html|title=Ordnance Field Parks 1 to 19|publisher=British Army units 1945 on|accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Post-war to 1993==\n[[File:Wheelbarrow bomb disposal device being operated by a team from 321 EOD MOD 45159057.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wheelbarrow (robot)|Wheelbarrow]] bomb disposal device being operated by a team from [[321 EOD Squadron RLC|321 EOD Coy]] RAOC, Northern Ireland 1978.]]\nDuring the war the RAOC HQ (together with the RAOC School) had moved from Hilsea to [[Middleton Stoney]] (Bicester); in 1946 it moved again to Matthew Barracks, [[Tidworth Camp|Tidworth]] and shortly afterwards to [[Princess Royal Barracks, Deepcut|Deepcut]].

As well as disposing of large amounts of surplus stock from depots at home, and returning in good order sites that had been requisitioned for the duration of the war, RAOC units were heavily involved in clearing ammunition from Germany's former depots and dealing with live devices still in the field. The RAOC's skills in bomb disposal were later put to increasing use in dealing with terrorist devices at home as well as in conflict zones overseas. The training of Ammunition Examiners, [[Ammunition Technician]]s and [[Ammunition Technical Officer]]s at the [[Army School of Ammunition]] became progressively more specialised during the 1950s and '60s. In May 1970 a section of [[321 EOD Squadron RLC|321 EOD Unit]] was sent to [[Northern Ireland]] to support the local ammunition inspectorate in dealing with [[improvised explosive devices]]; what was initially a 6-month deployment marked the start of a much longer involvement through [[the Troubles]].<ref name=\"Steer 2005\" />\n\nIn the period 1945\u201393 the RAOC, as with the rest of the Army, reduced greatly in size and closed its worldwide bases as garrisons withdrew. At the same time, there was considerable development of warehousing techniques and information technology (the first move towards [[computer]]isation came with the opening of an [[Automated data medium|Automated Data Processing]] Installation at Chilwell in 1963 and one at Bicester the following year.) In the mid-1960s new recruits were informed that 'The RAOC occupies nearly 90 different locations in the UK alone and world wide uses 86,000,000 square feet of storage space. Over 1,000,000 different items are held in stock and over 11,000,000 issues are made in a year'.<ref name=\"Notes\">[https://rnzaoc.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/50102626-raocbookletmcleod.pdf ''Notes on the Royal Army Ordnance Corps''], published in the wake of the 1964 McLeod changes.</ref> By 1980 the RAOC was reduced to two CODs at Bicester and Donnington (COD Chilwell was closing, CODs [[Branston, Staffordshire|Branston]] and Didcot had closed in 1963 and Weedon in 1965 after being downgraded from a COD in 1957), two CADs at Kineton and Longtown (Nesscliffe had closed in 1959, Corsham in 1963 and Bramley in 1974) and three Central Vehicle Depots: [[Ludgershall, Wiltshire|Ludgershall]] for 'A' (armoured) vehicles, and [[Ashchurch]] and [[Hilton, Derbyshire|Hilton]] for 'B' ('soft-skinned') vehicles<ref>[https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1986/mar/18/raoc-hilton RAOC Hilton (Historic Hansard: House of Commons debate, 18 March 1986).]</ref> (CVD [[Marchington]] having closed in 1965, CVDs [[Feltham]] and [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]] in the early 1970s).<ref name=\"Steer 2005\" />\n\nAcross the UK the structure of smaller Regional Depots, Ordnance Support Units (OSUs), Training Materiel Parks, supply depots and Ammunition Sub-Depots was steadily run down.

After the [[Somerville Logistic Reorganisation Committee Report]] of 1977 the head of the corps was re-titled Director General Ordnance Services (DGOS).

At its renaming as a Royal Corps in 1918 it was both a supply and repair corps.  In the supply area it had responsibility for weapons, armoured vehicles and other military equipment, ammunition and clothing and certain minor functions such as laundry, mobile baths and photography. The RAOC was also responsible for a major element of the repair of Army equipment.  In 1942 the latter function was transferred to the [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]] (REME) and the vehicle storage and spares responsibilities of the [[Royal Army Service Corps]] were in turn passed over to the RAOC.  The RAOC retained repair responsibilities for ammunition, clothing and certain ranges of general stores.  In 1964 the [[McLeod Reorganisation of Army Logistics]] resulted in the RAOC absorbing petroleum, rations and accommodation stores functions from the Royal Army Service Corps as well as the [[Army Fire Service]], barrack services, sponsorship of [[NAAFI]] (EFI) and the management of [[staff clerk]]s from the same Corps.  On 5 April 1993, the RAOC was one of the corps that amalgamated to form The [[Royal Logistic Corps]] (RLC).\n\nThe permanent establishment of an [[Ordnance Office]] long predated that of a [[standing army]] in Britain; it has therefore been claimed that 'in a wide sense, as heirs to the master-[[bowyers]], master-[[Fletcher (occupation)|fletchers]], master-[[carpenters]] and master-[[Metalsmith|smiths]] who, in mediaeval days, were responsible as Officers of Ordnance for the care and provision of warlike mat\u00e9riel, and to their successors the storekeepers, [[clerk]]s, [[Armed-forces artificer|artificers]], [[armourers]] and [[Storeman|storemen]] of the Board of Ordnance, the R.A.O.C. can claim a far longer continuous history and more ancient lineage than any other unit of the British Army'.<ref name=\"Forbes1929\">{{cite book |last1=Forbes |first1=Major General A. |title=The History of the Army Ordnance Services, vol.

Thereafter followed thirty years of fluctuating allocation of responsibilities and a great variety of titles of both corps and individuals.

The Storekeeper's department, on the other hand, was part of the [[Civilian|civil]] establishment, though (as with much of the Board's activity) troops were involved in various aspects of its operation when not [[Military deployment|deployed]] elsewhere.<ref name=\"Hogg1963\" /> In any case, modern distinctions between civilian and military personnel were not so clear cut for those serving under the Board: its officers, [[military engineers|engineers]] and [[artillerymen]] received their commissions or patents from the [[Master-General of the Ordnance]], as did the Storekeepers, artificers and storemen. Though civilians, the Storekeepers were provided with uniform, akin to that of the Royal Artillery, described in 1833 as a blue coat with red stand-collar and cuffs, gold [[epaulettes]] indicating rank and blue trousers with a gold stripe, worn with a gold-[[Hilt|hilted]] sword and a [[cocked hat]]; Clerks on the establishment wore the same uniform but without epaulettes. After [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] they were given relative rank (for the purpose of allotting appropriate quarters): Storekeepers to rank as lieutenant colonel, Deputy Storekeepers as major (if in independent charge) or else captain, Assistant Storekeepers as lieutenant and Clerks as a non-commissioned officer.<ref name=\"Forbes1929\" /> The Storekeepers and their Deputies had oversight of the [[Board of Ordnance#Storage and supply: the Ordnance Yards|Ordnance Yards]], both at home and abroad, however they were never deployed in the [[theatre of war]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/royal-naval-dockyard-staff/|title=Royal Naval dockyard staff|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Field Train Department of the Board of Ordnance====\nBy the mid-eighteenth century, Woolwich Warren (the future [[Royal Arsenal]]) had outgrown the [[Tower of London]] as the main ordnance storage depot in the realm.<ref name=Hogg1963>{{cite book |last=Hogg |first=Brigadier O.F.G. |year=1963 |title=The Royal Arsenal Woolwich |volume=Volume I |location=London |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}\n</ref> In times of war, the Board of Ordnance Storekeepers found themselves responsible for conveying guns, ammunition and certain other items to the troops [[Field of battle|in the field]] (whereas provision of food, supplies and other equipment was largely dependent on the [[Commissariat]], a department of [[HM Treasury]]). Until 1792, the transport and issue of weapons and ammunition to troops in the [[theatre of war]] was achieved by the formation of [[artillery train]]s, as and where required. In that year, with Britain about to engage in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], the Board sought to place this ''ad hoc'' arrangement on a permanent footing by establishing a '''Field Train Department'''. A Lieutenant-General of the Royal Artillery served as its Commandant and a Major-General as his Deputy, but otherwise its personnel were uniformed civilians: under a Senior [[Commissary]] based at Woolwich were Commissaries, Assistant Commissaries, Clerks of Stores and Conductors of Stores (equivalent to [[Major]]s, [[Captain (Army)|Captains]], [[subalterns]] and [[NCOs]] respectively).<ref name=\"Sharpe1993\" /> In peace time nothing more than a small [[Cadre (military)|cadre]] of officers was maintained (at the headquarters in Woolwich), but in time of war they were supplemented by recruits from the Ordnance Storekeeper's department to serve in the field; thus the strength of the Department varied dramatically, from 4 or 5 (during the peaceful years 1828-1853) to 346 at its peak in 1813. Each recruit received special training in the handling of munitions. During the Crimean War a number of Sergeants were seconded from the Royal Artillery to serve as [[Conductor (military appointment)|Military Conductors]] in addition to the civilian staff.<ref name=\"Steer 2005\">{{cite book |last1=Steer |first1=Brigadier Frank |title=To The Warrior His Arms: the story of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps 1918-1993 |date=2005 |publisher=Pen & Sword |location=Barnsley, S.

C. |title=The Field Train Department of the Board of Ordnance |date=1993 |publisher=Royal Logistic Corps museum}}</ref> The Field Train Department provided the Royal Engineers with their [[pontoon bridge]]s and other specialist equipment, and (until the formation of a separate Corps of Artillery Drivers) provided for the movement of [[artillery piece]]s in the field (other than those pertaining to the [[Royal Horse Artillery]]). For the duration of conflict the Department's personnel accompanied the Artillery and Engineer units in the field providing them with logistic support (including repair facilities).<ref name=\"Sharpe1993\" />\n\nBetween 1795 and 1815, the Field Train served in thirty expeditions and campaigns.<ref name=\"Steer 2005\"/> In peacetime, the civilians and sergeants returned to their former duties, but the cadre of officers was retained; they were based initially in the Royal Arsenal, and then in the [[Royal Artillery Barracks#Related institutions in Woolwich|Grand Depot]] (just off [[Woolwich Common]]) where the guns were stored ready for deployment. At the start of the Crimean War, the Ordnance Field Train was [[mobilized]] once again. An parallel supply corps within the Army (the [[Royal Waggon Train]], first established in 1794) had been disbanded as a cost-cutting measure in 1833, however, and its responsibilities devolved again to the Commissariat (which was by now more attuned to peacetime operations than warfare);<ref name=\"Steer 2005\"/> after a well-publicised series of logistical failings the Commissariat and the Board of Ordnance, as well as the command-structure of the army itself, were all strongly criticised, leading (among other things) to the abolition of the Board (in 1855) and its Field Train Department (in 1859, its officers having transferred to the new Military Store Department).<ref name=\"Sharpe1993\" />\n\n===After Crimea===\nIn the years following the Crimean War three corps can be identified as the direct predecessors of the RAOC.  The '''Military Store Department''' (MSD) created in 1861 granted military commissions and provided officers to manage stores inventories.  In parallel a subordinate corps of warrant officers and sergeants, the '''Military Store Clerks Corps''' (MSC), was also created to carry out clerical duties.  These small corps (235 officers in the MSD and 44 MSC) were based largely at the [[Tower of London]], [[Royal Arsenal|Woolwich Arsenal]] and [[Weedon Bec]], but were also deployable on active service. They were supplemented in 1865 by the establishment at Woolwich of a '''Military Store Staff Corps'''  (MSSC) to provide soldiers:<ref>HED Harris ' the First Five Hundred Years', RAOC School, Blackdown 1962. pp65-67</ref> initially 200-strong, it had more than doubled in size by 1869, with units in Portsmouth, Devonport, Aldershot, Dublin and Chatham as well as at Woolwich and the Tower.<ref name=\"Forbes1929\" />\n\nIn 1870 a further reorganisation, ostensibly to simplify management, resulted in the MSD, MSC and MSSC being grouped with the [[Royal Army Service Corps|Army Service Corps]] (ASC) under the [[Control Department]].  The officers remained a separate branch (Ordnance or Military Stores) in the Control Department but the soldiers were absorbed into the ASC.  This arrangement lasted until 1876.<ref>Major General A Forbes 'A History of Army Ordnance Services', Medici Society, London 1929. Vol II pp 151-152</ref>\n\nThe Control Department was disbanded in 1876.  The Ordnance/Military Store officers joined a newly created '''Ordnance Stores Department''' (OSD).  Five years later, in 1881, the soldiers also left the ASC and became the '''Ordnance Store Corps''' (OSC).  In 1894 there were further changes.  The OSD was retitled the '''Army Ordnance Department''' (AOD) and absorbed the Inspectors of Machinery from the [[Royal Artillery]] (RA).  In parallel the OSC was retitled the '''Army Ordnance Corps''' (AOC) and at the same time absorbed the Corps of Armourers and the RA's Armament Artificers.<ref>Major General A Forbes 'A History of the Army Ordnance Services' Medici Society, London 1929. Vol II pp 153-5</ref>\n\nIn 1918 the AOD and AOC amalgamated to form the Royal Army Ordnance Corps and for the first time officers and soldiers served in the same organisation; it received the \"Royal\" prefix in recognition of their service during the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1922.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nam.ac.uk/explore/royal-army-ordnance-corps|title=Royal Army Ordnance Corps|publisher=National Army Museum|accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Ordnance Services Organisation before 1914==\n[[File:Greenwich Heritage Centre, Woolwich - RA & RMA exhibition 26 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Red Barracks, Woolwich]]\n===Depots and other installations===\nThe earliest depot for military stores was the [[Tower of London]], headquarters of the [[Ordnance Office]], which for many centuries sufficed to hold the country's central stocks of artillery, gunpowder, small arms and ammunition albeit in unsatisfactory circumstances. The Tower continued to be used for storage into the 19th century, but in 1671 the Board of Ordnance acquired a parcel of land at [[Woolwich]] which soon supplanted the Tower to become the Board's main ordnance storage depot; manufacture as well as storage of guns and ammunition took place on the site, which was later named the [[Royal Arsenal]]. In 1760 the Royal Gunpowder Magazine was established at [[Purfleet]], replacing the Tower as Britain's central repository of gunpowder. In 1808 a modern purpose-built depot was constructed at [[Weedon Bec|Weedon]], alongside the Grand Union Canal, to serve as a safe repository for guns and ammunition;<ref>Major General A Forbes 'A History of the Army Ordnance Services' Medici Society, London 1929. Vol I. p192</ref> and in 1813 a new Grand Storehouse was opened in the Royal Arsenal, containing multiple warehouses for all kinds of military stores. When [[Woolwich Dockyard]] closed in 1869, the entire dockyard site was taken over by the War Office to become a vast ordnance stores complex, annexed (and [[Royal Arsenal Railway|linked by rail]]) to the ordnance stores in the Royal Arsenal; large stocks of barrack stores, [[Horse harness|harnesses]], [[accoutrements]] and other general stores were transferred to Woolwich Dockyard from the Tower at this time. At the same time the Military Store Department moved its headquarters from the Tower to the Red Fort at Woolwich (which had originally been built as the infirmary for the adjacent [[Royal Marine Barracks, Woolwich|Royal Marine Barracks]], linked to the nearby Dockyard);<ref>{{cite book|last1=Semark|first1=H.W.|title=The Royal Naval Armament Depots of Priddy's Hard, Elson, Frater and Bedenham, 1768\u20131977|date=1997|publisher=Hampshire County Council|location=Winchester|page=124}}</ref> as [[Royal Marine Barracks, Woolwich#Red Barracks|Red Barracks]], it would continue to serve as the [[Regimental depot|regimental Depot]], headquarters and home of the ordnance corps for the next fifty years. Finally, by about 1887, large stocks of small arms were moved from the Tower of London to Weedon, leaving the Tower to serve as a repository of ancient arms and armour and as a small Ordnance centre for troops in London.<ref name=\"Forbes1929\" />  \n\n[[File:Selby, Old MOD Ordnance Depot - geograph.org.uk - 159590.jpg|thumb|right|The former [[Barlby]] Ordnance Depot, dating from 1889 (one of a number of small depots established at that time).]]\nIn addition to these central depots, ordnance yards in the naval and garrison towns of [[Chatham Dockyard#The Gun Wharf|Chatham]], [[Gunwharf Quays|Portsmouth]] and [[HMNB Devonport#Morice Yard (New Gun Wharf)|Plymouth]] held reserve stocks of camp equipment, entrenching tools, small-arms and ammunition, accoutrements, harness and saddlery (similar stores were also provided at Dublin, Gibraltar and Malta). During the Crimean War, however, these arrangements proved unequal to the task of equipping an army with speed at a time of [[mobilization]]. After the war an Ordnance station was established as part of the new training camp at [[Aldershot Garrison|Aldershot]]: a hutted encampment was provided for troops to practise combined training, alongside a depot to furnish them with field stores.<ref name=\"Forbes1929\" /> In the 1880s an effort was made to decentralise the reserves of equipment; as many as sixty-two small regional centres were set up, in an effort to bring stores closer to the units that would use them. Later, with the establishment of larger camps and garrisons in the early 20th century, these were consolidated into eighteen larger Ordnance stations. At the same time, during the period from the 1860s to 1914, various depots were established to support the Army throughout the world (with the notable exception of India where the Indian Army managed its own parallel organisation in [[Ordnance Depot Quetta, Rawalpindi and Karachi]] (then British India and now Pakistan), the Indian Army Ordnance Corps (IAOC). In 1881 there were detachments in Dublin, [[Jersey]], [[Gibraltar]], [[Malta]], [[Bermuda]], [[Canada]], [[St Helena]], [[Cape Colony|Cape of Good Hope]], [[Mauritius]] and [[Straits Settlements]].

A Central Ordnance Depot (COD) and workshop to support vehicles, built on the site of the First World War [[National Shell Filling Factory, Chilwell]], opened in 1937.  The operation of this depot was notable in that it mirrored and tried to improve on best civilian practice at the time; this became a hallmark of RAOC development in the following decades. [[Branston Depot|COD Branston]] was established in 1938, initially to serve as the Army's main clothing store, freeing up space at COD Didcot.

As well as disposing of large amounts of surplus stock from depots at home, and returning in good order sites that had been requisitioned for the duration of the war, RAOC units were heavily involved in clearing ammunition from Germany's former depots and dealing with live devices still in the field. The RAOC's skills in bomb disposal were later put to increasing use in dealing with terrorist devices at home as well as in conflict zones overseas. The training of Ammunition Examiners, [[Ammunition Technician]]s and [[Ammunition Technical Officer]]s at the [[Army School of Ammunition]] became progressively more specialised during the 1950s and '60s. In May 1970 a section of [[321 EOD Squadron RLC|321 EOD Unit]] was sent to [[Northern Ireland]] to support the local ammunition inspectorate in dealing with [[improvised explosive devices]]; what was initially a 6-month deployment marked the start of a much longer involvement through [[the Troubles]].<ref name=\"Steer 2005\" />\n\nIn the period 1945\u201393 the RAOC, as with the rest of the Army, reduced greatly in size and closed its worldwide bases as garrisons withdrew.

After 1981 in [[NATO]] assigned units, principally those in [[British Army of the Rhine]] (BAOR), the standard NATO system was adopted with all appointments elsewhere changing the following year.\n\nThe senior RAOC appointment was Director Equipment and Ordnance Stores (DEOS) \u2212 always a [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] \u2212 which during the 1920s became Director Ordnance Services (DOS). DOS was also a title given to senior RAOC officers at major commands such as [[Middle East Command]], [[21st Army Group]] and in more recent times BAOR.  After the [[Somerville Logistic Reorganisation Committee Report]] of 1977 the head of the corps was re-titled Director General Ordnance Services (DGOS). Following the huge expansion of the RAOC in the [[Second World War]] the senior RAOC major general was designated Controller Ordnance Services (COS) from 1942<ref>Brigadier AH Fernyhough 'History of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps 1920-45' RAOC.

All RAOC appointments gave the staff grade (e.g. Staff Officer Grade 2: SO2 suffixed with the word Sup), the head of corps in a headquarters irrespective of rank was titled Comd Sup.
