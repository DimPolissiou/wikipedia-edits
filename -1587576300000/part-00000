Races can be saved and resumed mid-session in offline modes. Offline grids are automatically selected depending on the series and season selected by the player. Alternatively races can be made into single-make sessions, allowing creation of [[Porsche Carrera Cup]] and [[Lamborghini Super Trofeo]] races. Car selection in multiplayer is free unless determined through server settings.\n\n{{Expand section|date=April 2019}}\n\n== Development ==\nDevelopment of ''Assetto Corsa Competizione'' moved from an in-house developed graphics engine used in the studio's previous title ''[[Assetto Corsa]]'' to [[Unreal Engine|Unreal Engine 4]] to ensure graphics engine support for night races and realistic weather conditions. With the new engine, an evolution of the tire and aerodynamic physics models used in the previous title, motion capture animations, modern audio solutions and the detailed focus on a single series and class of cars the developer aims to reach a higher standard of driving realism and immersion for the new title.

It lies in the region of [[Bundelkhand]] on the banks of the [[Pahuj River]], in the extreme south of Uttar Pradesh. Jhansi is the administrative headquarters of [[Jhansi district]] and [[Jhansi division]]. Also called the ''Gateway to Bundelkhand'', Jhansi is situated between the rivers Pahuj and Betwa at an average elevation of 285 metres (935&nbsp;feet). It is about {{convert|415|km|mi|0}} from [[New Delhi]] and {{convert|99|km|mi|0}} south of [[Gwalior]].\n\nThe original walled city grew around its stone fort which crowns a neighbouring rock. The ancient name of the city was Balwantnagar.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} From 1817 to 1854, Jhansi was the capital of the princely state of Jhansi which was ruled by [[Gurjar]] rajas. The state was annexed by the British Governor General in 1854; Damodar Rao's claim to the throne was rejected but [[Rani Lakshmibai]] ruled it from June 1857 to June 1858.\n\nJhansi is well connected to all other major towns in [[Uttar Pradesh]] by road and railway networks. The [[National Highways Development Project]] has supported development of Jhansi.Jhansi is also being developed as the defence corridor by the NDA government which will boost the economy of the city and the region at the same time. [[Srinagar]] to [[Kanyakumari]] North-South corridor passes closely to Jhansi as does the East-West corridor; consequently there has been a sudden rush of infrastructure and real estate development in the city.Jhansi was adjudged the third cleanest city of Uttar Pradesh and the fastest moving city in the North Zone in Swachh Survekshan 2018 rankings. A [[Greenfield project|greenfield]] airport development has been planned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.igovernment.in/site/uttar-pradesh-plans-develop-jhansi-airport-39569 |title=Uttar Pradesh plans to develop Jhansi airport |date=4 January 2011 |publisher=igovernment.in |accessdate=3 September 2015\n|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321093043/http://www.igovernment.in/site/uttar-pradesh-plans-develop-jhansi-airport-39569 |archivedate=21 March 2012 }}</ref> On 28 August 2015, Jhansi was selected among 98 cities for [[Smart Cities Mission|smart city]] initiative by [[Government of India]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-releases-list-of-98-cities-for-smart-city-project/article7586751.ece|title=Centre unveils list of 98 smart cities; UP, TN strike it rich|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=28 August 2015|last1=Jeelani|first1=Mehboob}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://mygov.in/group-issue/smart-city-jhansi/|title=Smart City Jhansi|website=Mygov.in|accessdate=24 June 2016|date=26 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://lucknow.amarujala.com/feature/city-news-lkw/poor-performance-of-up-city-in-smart-city-list-hindi-news/page-2/|title=\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0930\u094d\u091f \u0938\u093f\u091f\u0940 \u0915\u0940 \u092a\u0930\u0940\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092b\u0947\u0932 \u0939\u0941\u090f \u092f\u0942\u092a\u0940 \u0915\u0947 12 \u0936\u0939\u0930|publisher=[[Amar Ujala]]|date=30 January 2016}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File: The Fort, Jhansi, a gelatin silver photo, c.1900.jpg|thumb|left|Jhansi Fort, 1900]]\nIn the 18th century, the town of Jhansi served as the capital of a Maratha province and later the [[Jhansi State|Princely State of Jhansi]] from 1804 till 1853, when the territory became a part of British India.\n\n==Geography and climate==\nJhansi is located at 25.4333 N 78.5833 E. It has an average elevation of 284 metres (935&nbsp;feet).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/36/Jhansi.html|title=Jhansi, India Page|publisher=fallingrain.com|accessdate=3 September 2012}}</ref> Jhansi lies on the plateau of central India, an area dominated by rocky relief and minerals underneath the soil. The city has a natural slope in the north as it is on the south western border of the vast ''[[Tarai]]'' plains of Uttar Pradesh and the elevation rises on the south. The land is suitable for species of [[citrus fruit]] and crops include wheat, pulses, peas, and oilseeds. The region relies heavily on [[Monsoon]] the rains for irrigation purposes. Under an ambitious canal project (the Rajghat canal), the government is constructing a network of canals for irrigation in Jhansi and Lalitpur and some part of Madhya Pradesh. The trade in agricultural products (including grain and oilseeds) is of great economic importance.<ref>''The Macmillan Encyclopedia''; rev. ed. London: Macmillan, 1983; p. 647</ref> The city is also a centre of brassware manufacture.<ref>Moore, W. G. (1971) ''The Penguin Encyclopedia of Places''. Harmondsworth: Penguin; p. 371</ref>\n{{wide image|View of Jhansi from Sipri's Hilltop.jpg|900px|A view of Jhansi from the hill of Sipri)}}\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main article|Climate of Madhya Pradesh}}\nBeing on a rocky plateau, Jhansi experiences extreme temperatures. Winter begins in October with the retreat of the [[Climate of India#Monsoon|Southwest Monsoon]] (Jhansi does not experience any rainfall from the [[October Heat|Northeast Monsoon]]) and peaks in mid-December. The mercury generally reads about 4 degrees minimum and 21 degrees maximum. Spring arrives by the end of February and is a short-lived phase of transition. Summer begins by April and summer temperatures can peak at 47 degrees in May. The rainy season starts by the third week of June (although this is variable year to year). Monsoon rains gradually weaken in September and the season ends by the last week of September. In the rainy season, the average daily high temperature hovers around 36 degrees Celsius with high humidity. The average rainfall for the city is about 900&nbsp;mm per year, occurring almost entirely within the three-and-a-half months of the [[Southwest Monsoon]]. In summer Jhansi experiences temperatures as high as 45-47 degrees and in winter the temperatures fall as low as 0-1 degrees (recorded in winter 2011).\n\n{{Weather box\n| location           = Jhansi (1971\u20132000)\n| metric first       = Yes\n| single line        = Yes\n| temperature colour = \n| Jan record high C = 33.8\n| Feb record high C = 39.4\n| Mar record high C = 43.3\n| Apr record high C = 46.2\n| May record high C = 48.0\n| Jun record high C = 47.8\n| Jul record high C = 45.6\n| Aug record high C = 42.2\n| Sep record high C = 40.6\n| Oct record high C = 40.6\n| Nov record high C = 38.1\n| Dec record high C = 33.1\n| year record high C = 48.0\n| Jan high C = 23.3\n| Feb high C = 26.9\n| Mar high C = 33.3\n| Apr high C = 39.3\n| May high C = 42.3\n| Jun high C = 40.5\n| Jul high C = 34.0\n| Aug high C = 32.2\n| Sep high C = 33.3\n| Oct high C = 33.9\n| Nov high C = 29.6\n| Dec high C = 24.5\n| year high C = 32.9\n| Jan low C = 7.4\n| Feb low C = 10.3\n| Mar low C = 15.8\n| Apr low C = 21.9\n| May low C = 26.3\n| Jun low C = 27.3\n| Jul low C = 24.6\n| Aug low C = 23.7\n| Sep low C = 22.8\n| Oct low C = 19.1\n| Nov low C = 13.2\n| Dec low C = 8.5\n| year low C = 18.4\n| Jan record low C = 1.2\n| Feb record low C = 0.6\n| Mar record low C = 5.3\n| Apr record low C = 10.1\n| May record low C = 15.1\n| Jun record low C = 18.5\n| Jul record low C = 20.3\n| Aug record low C = 18.3\n| Sep record low C = 16.7\n| Oct record low C = 10.7\n| Nov record low C = 1.1\n| Dec record low C = 0.3\n| year record low C = 0.3\n| precipitation colour = green\n| Jan precipitation mm = 9.2\n| Feb precipitation mm = 9.6\n| Mar precipitation mm = 7.7\n| Apr precipitation mm = 2.3\n| May precipitation mm = 13.9\n| Jun precipitation mm = 85.0\n| Jul precipitation mm = 270.4\n| Aug precipitation mm = 286.2\n| Sep precipitation mm = 165.3\n| Oct precipitation mm = 31.8\n| Nov precipitation mm = 6.3\n| Dec precipitation mm = 3.6\n| year precipitation mm = 891.3\n| Jan rain days = 0.9\n| Feb rain days = 1.0\n| Mar rain days = 0.7\n| Apr rain days = 0.5\n| May rain days = 1.3\n| Jun rain days = 4.9\n| Jul rain days = 12.3\n| Aug rain days = 13.1\n| Sep rain days = 7.0\n| Oct rain days = 1.6\n| Nov rain days = 0.5\n| Dec rain days = 0.5\n| year rain days = 44.2\n| source 1 = India Meteorological Department (record high and low up to 2010)<ref name= IMD >{{cite web\n| url = http://www.imd.gov.in/section/climate/extreme/jhansi2.htm\n| title = Jhansi Climatological Table Period: 1971\u20132000\n| publisher = [[India Meteorological Department]]\n| accessdate = 15 April 2015\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150518083641/http://www.imd.gov.in/section/climate/extreme/jhansi2.htm\n| archive-date = 18 May 2015\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref><ref name=IMD2>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.imdpune.gov.in/Temp_Extremes/histext2010.pdf \n |title=Ever recorded Maximum and minimum temperatures up to 2010 \n |publisher=India Meteorological Department \n |accessdate=15 April 2015 \n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316064314/http://www.imdpune.gov.in/Temp_Extremes/histext2010.pdf\n |archivedate=16 March 2014\n  \n}}</ref> \n| date     = November 2012}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|title=Historical population\n|type=Kashipur\n|1871|30,000\n|1881|33,000\n|1891|53,779\n|1901|55,724\n|1911|70,200\n|1921|66,400\n|1931|76,700\n|1941|103,300\n|1951|127,400\n|1961|140,200\n|1971|173,300\n|1981|231,300\n|1991|300,850\n|2001|426,198\n|2011|505,693\n|source      = 1871-1891 - [[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Imperial Gazetteer of India, Volume 14, page 148|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V14_154.gif|website=dsal.uchicago.edu|publisher=Digital South Asia Library|accessdate=20 July 2017}}</ref><br>1901-1981 - Populstat.info<ref>{{cite web|title=INDIA : urban population|url=http://www.populstat.info/Asia/indiat.htm|website=www.populstat.info|accessdate=20 July 2017}}</ref><br>1991-2011 - Citypopulation.de<ref>{{cite web|title=Jhansi (Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, India) - Population Statistics and Location in Maps and Charts|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/php/india-uttarpradesh.php?cityid=0943614000|website=www.citypopulation.de|accessdate=20 July 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of [[2011 Indian Census]], Jhansi city had a total population of 505,693, of which 265,449 were males and 240,244 were females.

Platform One is {{convert|2525|ft|m}} long making it the seventh longest in the world so could easily handle two trains at a time. Platforms two and three are also long enoungh to do this. The first [[Shatabdi Express]] of India started between New Delhi and Jhansi. Earlier Jhansi used to be a part of Central railways zone headquartered at Mumbai but now comes under NCR headquartered at Allahabad.[[File:Plateform-Railway Station Jhansi.JPG|thumb|Platform - Jhansi Railway Station]]\n\n===Road transport===\n\nJhansi is located at the junction of these National Highways: [[National Highway 27 (India)]] from [[Gujarat]] to [[Assam]]; [[National Highway 75 (India)]] from [[Gwalior]] to [[Rewa, Madhya Pradesh|Rewa]] via Chhatarpur; [[National Highway 44 (India)]] from [[Jammu]] to [[Kanyakumari]]; and [[National Highway 39 (India)]]. Thus, Jhansi commands a strategic position in the roadways network as highways in five different directions diverge from it.\n\nThe towns and major cities connected to it are [[Datia]], [[Gwalior]], [[Lalitpur, India|Lalitpur]], [[Agra]], [[New Delhi]], [[Bhopal]], [[Allahabad]], [[Kanpur]], [[Orchha]], [[Shivpuri]], [[Chhatarpur]], Unnao Balaji, and [[Sagar, Madhya Pradesh|Sagar]].\n\nThe [[North\u2013South and East-West Corridor|north-south and east-west corridors]] pass and cross each other only in Jhansi and the city is also well connected to Kanpur, Lucknow and Madhya Pradesh by road. The four lanes national highway is at the last stage of its completion, giving a boom in infrastructure and other sectors in Jhansi and nearby areas;{{when|date=March 2013}}\n\n===Air transport===\n[[File: Amy Johnson jason india.jpg|thumb|[[Amy Johnson]] at Jhansi in 1932]]\n[[Jhansi Airport]] is a military aviation base built in the British era used by the Indian army and political visitors. Though there are provisions for private aircraft to land, there are no civil aviation operations. There had been a demand to make it operational for commercial purposes in the 1990s and again in the 2000s. The Uttar Pradesh government announced the construction of an all new civil aviation base to support tourism in Bundelkhand in April 2011.<ref>{{cite news|last=Manjul|first=Tarannum|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/new-airport-at-jhansi-to-boost-tourism/770258/|title=New airport at Jhansi to boost tourism|date=1 April 2011|work=indianexpress|accessdate=3 September 2012}}</ref> The Indian army maintains an objection to extension of the military aviation. So, the government has examined three different places other than army aviation base for the airport in Jhansi. [[Gwalior Airport]] is the nearest airport from Jhansi but has limited number of flights and facilities. [[Kanpur Airport]] is 4 hours drive from Jhansi and is well connected with other metropolitan cities in India.\nThere are plans to develop the Jhansi airport under the UDAN scheme of regional connectivity of central government.\nJhansi-Lucknow-Jhansi route was selected in UDAN 2 but the airline has not been selected yet.\nJhansi-Agra and Jhansi-Khajuraho routes have been suggested by the government for UDAN 3.There are still no plans to connect Jhansi with Delhi, the national capital and other cities like Mumbai in the south.\n\n==Armed forces==\nThe Jhansi Cantonment was the site of the accommodation for British civil and military personnel in the period of British rule in India.\n\n==Media==\n''Amar Ujala'', ''[[Dainik Jagran]]'', ''[[Rajasthan Patrika|Patrika]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.patrika.com/jhansi-news/|title = Jhansi Hindi News.|date = |accessdate = 13 December 2017|website = [[Rajasthan Patrika|Patrika]]|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> and ''Dainik Bhaskar'' are some of the newspapers with online news services.\n\n===Newspapers===\nMany national and local newspapers are published in Jhansi in Hindi, Urdu and English:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

According to the author, writing in the glossary to the earlier novel, ''[[Nightrunners of Bengal]]'', Bhowani is an \"imaginary town. To get a geographical bearing on the story it should be imagined to be about where Jhansi really is - 25.27 N., 78.33 E.\"<ref>Masters, John. ''Nightrunners of Bengal''. (London and New York, 1951). Glossary.</ref> ''Nightrunners of Bengal'' is set during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 at \"Bhowani\" (the title alludes to the mysterious distribution of \"chapatis\" to village headmen which preceded the revolt). ''[[Bhowani Junction]]'' is set in 1946/47 the eve of independence. In each novel the main character is a British army officer named Colonel Rodney Savage, one of a succession of such men from the same family.\n\n[[Christina Rossetti]] wrote a short poem about the fate of the Skene family at Jhansi during the [[Indian Mutiny]]. It is entitled \"In the Round Tower at Jhansi - 8 June 1857\". It was published in 1862 in the same volume as her more celebrated poem \"Goblin Market\". Some time afterward, Rossetti discovered that she had been misinformed about the husband and wife's suicide pact in the face of a murderous and implacable enemy ('The swarming howling wretches below' the tower walls) which is the poem's subject, but did not delete it from later editions.\n\nJhansi also appears as the backdrop for a portion of the [[George MacDonald Fraser]] novel ''[[Flashman in the Great Game]]'', set just before and during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].\n\n===Jhansi in films===\nMovies which are filmed in or associated with Jhansi include: ''[[Jhansi Ki Rani (1953

({{audio|Jhansi.ogg|pronunciation}}) is a historic city in the Indian state of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. It lies in the region of [[Bundelkhand]] on the banks of the [[Pahuj River]], in the extreme south of Uttar Pradesh. Jhansi is the administrative headquarters of [[Jhansi district]] and [[Jhansi division]]. Also called the ''Gateway to Bundelkhand'', Jhansi is situated between the rivers Pahuj and Betwa at an average elevation of 285 metres (935&nbsp;feet). It is about {{convert|415|km|mi|0}} from [[New Delhi]] and {{convert|99|km|mi|0}} south of [[Gwalior]].\n\nThe original walled city grew around its stone fort which crowns a neighbouring rock. The ancient name of the city was Balwantnagar.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} From 1817 to 1854, Jhansi was the capital of the princely state of Jhansi which was ruled by [[Gurjar]] rajas. The state was annexed by the British Governor General in 1854; Damodar Rao's claim to the throne was rejected but [[Rani Lakshmibai]] ruled it from June 1857 to June 1858.\n\nJhansi is well connected to all other major towns in [[Uttar Pradesh]] by road and railway networks. The [[National Highways Development Project]] has supported development of Jhansi.Jhansi is also being developed as the defence corridor by the NDA government which will boost the economy of the city and the region at the same time. [[Srinagar]] to [[Kanyakumari]] North-South corridor passes closely to Jhansi as does the East-West corridor; consequently there has been a sudden rush of infrastructure and real estate development in the city.Jhansi was adjudged the third cleanest city of Uttar Pradesh and the fastest moving city in the North Zone in Swachh Survekshan 2018 rankings.

It has an average elevation of 284 metres (935&nbsp;feet).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/36/Jhansi.html|title=Jhansi, India Page|publisher=fallingrain.com|accessdate=3 September 2012}}</ref> Jhansi lies on the plateau of central India, an area dominated by rocky relief and minerals underneath the soil. The city has a natural slope in the north as it is on the south western border of the vast ''[[Tarai]]'' plains of Uttar Pradesh and the elevation rises on the south. The land is suitable for species of [[citrus fruit]] and crops include wheat, pulses, peas, and oilseeds. The region relies heavily on [[Monsoon]] the rains for irrigation purposes. Under an ambitious canal project (the Rajghat canal), the government is constructing a network of canals for irrigation in Jhansi and Lalitpur and some part of Madhya Pradesh. The trade in agricultural products (including grain and oilseeds) is of great economic importance.<ref>''The Macmillan Encyclopedia''; rev. ed.

Winter begins in October with the retreat of the [[Climate of India#Monsoon|Southwest Monsoon]] (Jhansi does not experience any rainfall from the [[October Heat|Northeast Monsoon]]) and peaks in mid-December. The mercury generally reads about 4 degrees minimum and 21 degrees maximum. Spring arrives by the end of February and is a short-lived phase of transition. Summer begins by April and summer temperatures can peak at 47 degrees in May. The rainy season starts by the third week of June (although this is variable year to year). Monsoon rains gradually weaken in September and the season ends by the last week of September.

It lies on the main Delhi-Chennai and Delhi-Mumbai lines. The station code is JHS. It is well connected by train services to all parts of the country, including four metropolitan cities. There are direct trains to [[Mumbai]], [[Delhi]], [[Hyderabad]], [[Kolkata]], [[Chennai]], [[Bangalore]], [[Guwahati]], [[Visakhapatnam]], [[Nagpur]], [[Agra]], [[Gwalior]], [[Trivandrum]], [[Indore]], [[Ahmedabad]], [[Udaipur]], [[Pune]], [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[Jaipur]], [[Lucknow]], [[Bhopal]], [[Mahoba]], [[Khajuraho]], [[Gaya, India|Gaya]], [[Jalgaon]], [[Bhusaval]], [[Jabalpur]], [[Kanpur]], [[Allahabad]], [[Gorakhpur]], [[Bandra]] and other major towns.\n\n====History====\nThe railway station was built by the British in the late 1880s. After a long survey of three places the current site was selected for the station. The station has a massive fort-like building painted in maroon and off white.\n\nThe station had three platforms in the beginning. Platform One is {{convert|2525|ft|m}} long making it the seventh longest in the world so could easily handle two trains at a time. Platforms two and three are also long enoungh to do this. The first [[Shatabdi Express]] of India started between New Delhi and Jhansi. Earlier Jhansi used to be a part of Central railways zone headquartered at Mumbai but now comes under NCR headquartered at Allahabad.[[File:Plateform-Railway Station Jhansi.JPG|thumb|Platform - Jhansi Railway Station]]\n\n===Road transport===\n\nJhansi is located at the junction of these National Highways: [[National Highway 27 (India)]] from [[Gujarat]] to [[Assam]]; [[National Highway 75 (India)]] from [[Gwalior]] to [[Rewa, Madhya Pradesh|Rewa]] via Chhatarpur; [[National Highway 44 (India)]] from [[Jammu]] to [[Kanyakumari]]; and [[National Highway 39 (India)]]. Thus, Jhansi commands a strategic position in the roadways network as highways in five different directions diverge from it.\n\nThe towns and major cities connected to it are [[Datia]], [[Gwalior]], [[Lalitpur, India|Lalitpur]], [[Agra]], [[New Delhi]], [[Bhopal]], [[Allahabad]], [[Kanpur]], [[Orchha]], [[Shivpuri]], [[Chhatarpur]], Unnao Balaji, and [[Sagar, Madhya Pradesh|Sagar]].\n\nThe [[North\u2013South and East-West Corridor|north-south and east-west corridors]] pass and cross each other only in Jhansi and the city is also well connected to Kanpur, Lucknow and Madhya Pradesh by road. The four lanes national highway is at the last stage of its completion, giving a boom in infrastructure and other sectors in Jhansi and nearby areas;{{when|date=March 2013}}\n\n===Air transport===\n[[File: Amy Johnson jason india.jpg|thumb|[[Amy Johnson]] at Jhansi in 1932]]\n[[Jhansi Airport]] is a military aviation base built in the British era used by the Indian army and political visitors. Though there are provisions for private aircraft to land, there are no civil aviation operations.

So, the government has examined three different places other than army aviation base for the airport in Jhansi. [[Gwalior Airport]] is the nearest airport from Jhansi but has limited number of flights and facilities. [[Kanpur Airport]] is 4 hours drive from Jhansi and is well connected with other metropolitan cities in India.\nThere are plans to develop the Jhansi airport under the UDAN scheme of regional connectivity of central government.\nJhansi-Lucknow-Jhansi route was selected in UDAN 2 but the airline has not been selected yet.\nJhansi-Agra and Jhansi-Khajuraho routes have been suggested by the government for UDAN 3.There are still no plans to connect Jhansi with Delhi, the national capital and other cities like Mumbai in the south.\n\n==Armed forces==\nThe Jhansi Cantonment was the site of the accommodation for British civil and military personnel in the period of British rule in India.\n\n==Media==\n''Amar Ujala'', ''[[Dainik Jagran]]'', ''[[Rajasthan Patrika|Patrika]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.patrika.com/jhansi-news/|title = Jhansi Hindi News.|date = |accessdate = 13 December 2017|website = [[Rajasthan Patrika|Patrika]]|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> and ''Dainik Bhaskar'' are some of the newspapers with online news services.\n\n===Newspapers===\nMany national and local newspapers are published in Jhansi in Hindi, Urdu and English:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

According to the author, writing in the glossary to the earlier novel, ''[[Nightrunners of Bengal]]'', Bhowani is an \"imaginary town. To get a geographical bearing on the story it should be imagined to be about where Jhansi really is - 25.27 N., 78.33 E.\"<ref>Masters, John. ''Nightrunners of Bengal''. (London and New York, 1951). Glossary.</ref> ''Nightrunners of Bengal'' is set during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 at \"Bhowani\" (the title alludes to the mysterious distribution of \"chapatis\" to village headmen which preceded the revolt). ''[[Bhowani Junction]]'' is set in 1946/47 the eve of independence. In each novel the main character is a British army officer named Colonel Rodney Savage, one of a succession of such men from the same family.\n\n[[Christina Rossetti]] wrote a short poem about the fate of the Skene family at Jhansi during the [[Indian Mutiny]]. It is entitled \"In the Round Tower at Jhansi - 8 June 1857\". It was published in 1862 in the same volume as her more celebrated poem \"Goblin Market\". Some time afterward, Rossetti discovered that she had been misinformed about the husband and wife's suicide pact in the face of a murderous and implacable enemy ('The swarming howling wretches below' the tower walls) which is the poem's subject, but did not delete it from later editions.\n\nJhansi also appears as the backdrop for a portion of the [[George MacDonald Fraser]] novel ''[[Flashman in the Great Game]]'', set just before and during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].\n\n===Jhansi in films===\nMovies which are filmed in or associated with Jhansi include: ''[[Jhansi Ki Rani (1953 film)|Jhansi Ki Rani]]'' (1953 film), ''[[Love Marriage (1959 film)|Love Marriage]]'' (1959 film), ''[[Raavan]]'' (2010 film), ''[[Badrinath Ki Dulhania]]'' (2017 film), and ''[[Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi]]'' (2019 film).{{fact|date=March 2019}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Barua Sagar]]\n* [[List of educational institutions in Jhansi]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons}}\n* {{wikivoyage-inline|Jhansi}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.jhansi.nic.in}}\n\n{{Jhansi district}}\n{{Madhya Pradesh}}\n{{Jhansi division topics}}\n\n[[Category:Jhansi]]\n[[Category:Cities in Bundelkhand]]\n[[Category:Bundelkhand]]\n[[Category:Cities in Madhya Pradesh]]\n", "name_user": "2405:204:a29d:b29f::292a:b0a0", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Added some more school names to the list)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jhansi"}

It serves 17 stops between the {{stn|Expo Center}} and [[PSU South stations|PSU South/Southwest 6th and College]] stations; of these, seven stops occupy the median of [[Oregon Route 99W|North Interstate Avenue]], giving that segment its name. The Yellow Line runs for approximately 21 hours daily with a minimum [[headway]] of 15 minutes during most of the day.\n\nFollowing years of failed attempts to construct the [[MAX Light Rail#South\u2013North proposal|South\u2013North Line]] between [[Clackamas, Oregon|Clackamas]] and [[Vancouver, Washington]], Portland business leaders and local residents persuaded TriMet to build a light rail extension to North Portland in 1999. The line, which began construction in 2001, opened on May 1, 2004, four months ahead of schedule. From 2004 to 2009, the Yellow Line ran between Expo Center station in North Portland and the [[Library/Southwest 9th Avenue and Galleria/Southwest 10th Avenue stations|Library and Galleria stations]] in downtown Portland, sharing tracks within downtown with the [[MAX Blue Line|Blue Line]] and the [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]]. In 2009, TriMet rerouted it to the newly rebuilt Portland Transit Mall.\n\nSince 2015, the Yellow Line has operated as a northbound [[through train|through service]] of the [[MAX Orange Line|Orange Line]] from PSU South/Southwest 6th and College station, sharing its transit mall alignment with the [[MAX Green Line|Green Line]]. Conversely, most southbound Yellow Line trains, which had served the other half of the mall on 5th Avenue from 2009 to 2015, through operate into the Orange Line from [[Union Station/Northwest 6th & Hoyt and Union Station/Northwest 5th & Glisan stations|Union Station/Northwest 5th & Glisan Street station]] and terminate at [[Southeast Park Avenue station]] in [[Milwaukie, Oregon|Milwaukie]]. {{As of|September 2018}}, the Yellow Line is the fourth-busiest service in the MAX system, carrying an average of 13,170 weekday riders daily.\n\n==History==\n===Early proposals===\n{{See also|MAX Light Rail#South\u2013North proposal}}\n\n[[File:FREEWAY (ROUTE I-5) RUNS DIRECTLY THROUGH THIS ESTABLISHED RESIDENTIAL AREA OF NORTHEAST PORTLAND - NARA - 548092.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=refer to caption|An aerial view of Interstate 5 (near center) and Interstate Avenue (upper right) facing south, shown in 1973]]\n\nPortland city planners originally conceived the idea of a northside passenger rail line in 1988 as part of Portland's Central City and [[Albina, Oregon|Albina]] Community plans.<ref>{{cite news |last=Oliver |first=Gordon |title=Economic planning outlined |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=July 12, 1988 |page=B6}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Pickett |first=Nelson |title=Planning commission looks at Albina Community Plan |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=February 25, 1992 |page=B2}}</ref> These plans sought to extend light rail through North Portland across the [[Columbia River]] and into [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] via a potential route on either [[Oregon Route 99W|North Interstate Avenue]], [[Interstate 5 (Oregon)|Interstate 5]], or [[Oregon Route 99E|Northeast Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard]] (formerly Northeast Union Avenue).<ref>{{cite news |last=Mayer |first=James |title=Planners seek economic niche for inner city; Bureau plans 3-years study of North, Northeast Portland, hoping to help revive area |newspaper=[[The Oregonian]] |date=May 15, 1989 |page=B2}}</ref> As members of the U.S. [[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations|Senate Committee on Appropriations]], Oregon Senator [[Mark Hatfield]] and Washington Senator [[Brock Adams]] combined these proposals with the Portland\u2013[[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]] light rail plan, for which the committee appropriated $2&nbsp;million in September 1989.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kohler |first1=Vince |last2=Stewart |first2=Bill |title=Light-rail proposals gain ground in Congress; senate panel approves transportation funding bill, aiding plans for new Oregon City, Vancouver lines |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=September 10, 1989 |page=C2}}</ref>\n\nPreliminary alignment studies to [[Clark County, Washington|Clark County]], including an additional proposal for a line between [[Vancouver Mall]] and [[Clackamas Town Center]] along [[Interstate 205 (Oregon\u2013Washington)|Interstate 205]],<ref>{{cite news |last=Stewart |first=Bill |title=Clark County light-rail plans chugging along; more than $1&nbsp;million will be spent on studies on both sides of the river |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=September 24, 1989 |page=C2}}</ref> commenced shortly after.

It connects [[Neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon#North|North Portland]], [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|Portland City Center]], and [[Portland State University]] (PSU). The line runs north\u2013south from the [[Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center|Portland Expo Center]] to the [[Rose Quarter]] along a {{convert|5.8|mi|km|1|adj=on}} segment, referred to as the '''Interstate MAX''', and northbound through downtown Portland along the [[Portland Transit Mall]] on 6th Avenue. It serves 17 stops between the {{stn|Expo Center}} and [[PSU South stations|PSU South/Southwest 6th and College]] stations; of these, seven stops occupy the median of [[Oregon Route 99W|North Interstate Avenue]], giving that segment its name. The Yellow Line runs for approximately 21 hours daily with a minimum [[headway]] of 15 minutes during most of the day.\n\nFollowing years of failed attempts to construct the [[MAX Light Rail#South\u2013North proposal|South\u2013North Line]] between [[Clackamas, Oregon|Clackamas]] and [[Vancouver, Washington]], Portland business leaders and local residents persuaded TriMet to build a light rail extension to North Portland in 1999. The line, which began construction in 2001, opened on May 1, 2004, four months ahead of schedule. From 2004 to 2009, the Yellow Line ran between Expo Center station in North Portland and the [[Library/Southwest 9th Avenue and Galleria/Southwest 10th Avenue stations|Library and Galleria stations]] in downtown Portland, sharing tracks within downtown with the [[MAX Blue Line|Blue Line]] and the [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]]. In 2009, TriMet rerouted it to the newly rebuilt Portland Transit Mall.\n\nSince 2015, the Yellow Line has operated as a northbound [[through train|through service]] of the [[MAX Orange Line|Orange Line]] from PSU South/Southwest 6th and College station, sharing its transit mall alignment with the [[MAX Green Line|Green Line]]. Conversely, most southbound Yellow Line trains, which had served the other half of the mall on 5th Avenue from 2009 to 2015, through operate into the Orange Line from [[Union Station/Northwest 6th & Hoyt and Union Station/Northwest 5th & Glisan stations|Union Station/Northwest 5th & Glisan Street station]] and terminate at [[Southeast Park Avenue station]] in [[Milwaukie, Oregon|Milwaukie]]. {{As of|September 2018}}, the Yellow Line is the fourth-busiest service in the MAX system, carrying an average of 13,170 weekday riders daily.\n\n==History==\n===Early proposals===\n{{See also|MAX Light Rail#South\u2013North proposal}}\n\n[[File:FREEWAY (ROUTE I-5) RUNS DIRECTLY THROUGH THIS ESTABLISHED RESIDENTIAL AREA OF NORTHEAST PORTLAND - NARA - 548092.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=refer to caption|An aerial view of Interstate 5 (near center) and Interstate Avenue (upper right) facing south, shown in 1973]]\n\nPortland city planners originally conceived the idea of a northside passenger rail line in 1988 as part of Portland's Central City and [[Albina, Oregon|Albina]] Community plans.<ref>{{cite news |last=Oliver |first=Gordon |title=Economic planning outlined |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=July 12, 1988 |page=B6}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Pickett |first=Nelson |title=Planning commission looks at Albina Community Plan |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=February 25, 1992 |page=B2}}</ref> These plans sought to extend light rail through North Portland across the [[Columbia River]] and into [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] via a potential route on either [[Oregon Route 99W|North Interstate Avenue]], [[Interstate 5 (Oregon)|Interstate 5]], or [[Oregon Route 99E|Northeast Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard]] (formerly Northeast Union Avenue).<ref>{{cite news |last=Mayer |first=James |title=Planners seek economic niche for inner city; Bureau plans 3-years study of North, Northeast Portland, hoping to help revive area |newspaper=[[The Oregonian]] |date=May 15, 1989 |page=B2}}</ref> As members of the U.S. [[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations|Senate Committee on Appropriations]], Oregon Senator [[Mark Hatfield]] and Washington Senator [[Brock Adams]] combined these proposals with the Portland\u2013[[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]] light rail plan, for which the committee appropriated $2&nbsp;million in September 1989.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kohler |first1=Vince |last2=Stewart |first2=Bill |title=Light-rail proposals gain ground in Congress; senate panel approves transportation funding bill, aiding plans for new Oregon City, Vancouver lines |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=September 10, 1989 |page=C2}}</ref>\n\nPreliminary alignment studies to [[Clark County, Washington|Clark County]], including an additional proposal for a line between [[Vancouver Mall]] and [[Clackamas Town Center]] along [[Interstate 205 (Oregon\u2013Washington)|Interstate 205]],<ref>{{cite news |last=Stewart |first=Bill |title=Clark County light-rail plans chugging along; more than $1&nbsp;million will be spent on studies on both sides of the river |newspaper=The Oregonian |date=September 24, 1989 |page=C2}}</ref> commenced shortly after.

This chili pepper is consumed at the rate of 7-9 kg per year, per capita. It is mostly consumed fresh but also in different forms such as pickled, dried and smoked. Jalape\u00f1o varieties differ in size and heat. Typically, a grower passes through a jalape\u00f1o field many times, picking the unripe, green jalape\u00f1os for market. Jalape\u00f1os are green for most of the season but in the fall, which is the end of the growing season, they naturally ripen and turn bright red. In Mexico and the United States there is a growing market for ripe red jalape\u00f1os (the last stage of maturation). They are kept on the bush as long as possible. When they are deep red and have lost much of their moisture, they are picked to be made into chipotles.<ref>{{cite web |last1= Moreno-Escamilla |first1= Jes\u00fas Omar |title=Effect of the Smoking Process and Firewood Type in the Phytochemical Content and Antioxidant Capacity of Red Jalape\u00f1o Pepper during Its Transformation to Chipotle Pepper |url= https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963996915301162 |website= Science Direct |date= 26 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nSmoking is a common technique of food preservation that provides a distinctive aroma and flavor, and is traditionally carried out in a field open-oven.{{cn|date=April 2020}} The smoking process can affect structural, chemical and nutritional properties of food.

''Morita'' means \u201csmall mulberry\u201d in Spanish, and is grown primarily in the Chihuahua State, it is typically darker in color with a reddish-purple exterior. They are smoked for less time, and in many cultures considered inferior to the meco. The meco, which is also known as chili ahumado or t\u00edpico, is grayish tan in color with a dusty looking surface; some say it resembles a cigar butt. This variation of the pepper tends to be smokier in taste, and are the preferred chipotle of many natives. They are sometimes referred to as chili navide\u00f1o because they are reconstituted and stuffed to make a very traditional dish that is most popular at Christmas time amongst Mexican locals. \n\nMost chipotle meco never make it across the Mexican border, although they can occasionally be found for sale in Mexican specialty markets.\n\nChipotle grande is a smoke-dried Huachinango chili with a similar flavor profile, however the chili is larger, and higher in cost. Sold fresh at the market, this variation of the chipotle pepper will typically sell for three to four times as much as jalape\u00f1o. \n\nMany pair this spice with annatto, cumin, ginger, oregano and tomato powder. Additionally, it is most commonly paired with traditional dishes such as bean soup, pimento cheese, tomatillo salsa, fish tacos and grilled flank steak. \n\n\n\n'''Forms of chipotle'''<br>Chipotles are purchased in numerous forms: chipotle powder, chipotle flakes, chipotle pods, canned chipotles in adobo sauce, concentrated chipotle base and wet chipotle meat marinade.\n\nThe canned adobo sauce is the most common form found in the United States, though the marinade or food preservative form of it originated in Spain. Typically, the marinade contains a variety of spices, herbs, and vegetables including tomatoes, onions, the powdered dried chilis, garlic and vinegar. Two of the most popular brands of adobo sauce are La Morena (known for having the strongest chipotle flavor) and San Marcos, the preferred brand in Austin, Texas. \"''Chipocludo''\", a term for the way of preserving chipotles practiced in Central Mexico, refers to conservation in a jar of brown sugar and vinegar marinade. \"''En adobo''\" or \"''chipotles adobado''\" are denominations for seasoned canned chipotles in sauce.\n\n==Use==\nChipotles, often a key ingredient in a recipe, impart a relatively mild but earthy spiciness to many dishes in [[Cuisine of Mexico|Mexican cuisine]]. The chilis are used to make various [[salsa (sauce)|salsas]]. Chipotle can be ground and combined with other spices to make a meat marinade \u2013 ''[[adobo]]''. Chipotle is used, typically in powdered form, as an ingredient in both homemade and commercial products, including some brands of barbecue sauce and hot sauce, as well as in some chili con carnes and stews. Usually when used commercially, the product is advertised as having chipotle in it.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nChipotles are spicy and have a distinctive smoky flavor. The flesh is thick, so the chilis are usually used in a [[Simmering|slow-cooked]] dish rather than raw. It can also be lightly toasted on a dry comal or skillet, just until they are fragrant and slightly swell. When overcooked, they can be very bitter. For some traditional Mexican sauces, the toasted chilis would then be saut\u00e9ed in oil or lard before being pureed. The chilis can also be soaked in warm water or stock until they become pliable and then can be added to a dish. The different forms of chipotle can be added to soups and stews, and in the braising liquid for meat. They can also accompany beans, pickled vegetable mixes, scrambled eggs or ''[[chilaquiles]]''. They can also be stuffed and baked, and added to cake or brownies. \n\n'''Nutritional value'''  \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! colspan=\"2\" |Nutritional data per 100 g (3.5 oz)\n|-\n|Energy\n|1355 kj / 324 kcal\n|-\n|'''Carbohydrates''' \n|69.86g\n|-\n|Sugars \n|41.06g\n|-\n|Fiber\n|28.7g\n|-\n|'''Fat''' \n|4.36g\n|-\n|'''Protein'''\n|10.58g\n|-\n|'''Vitamins'''\n|\n|-\n|Vitamin A, IU\n|26488 IU\n|-\n|Vitamin A, RAE\n|1324 msg_RAE\n|-\n|Vitamin B (folate)\n|51mcg\n|-\n|Vitamin B<sub>3</sub> (Niacin)\n|8.669mg\n|-\n|Vitamin B<sub>6</sub>\n|0.810mg\n|-\n|Vitamin C (total ascorbic acid)\n|31.4mg\n|-\n|Vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol)\n|3.14mg\n|-\n|Vitamin K (phylloquinone)\n|108.2mcg\n|-\n|'''Minerals''' \n|\n|-\n|Calcium\n|45mg\n|-\n|Copper\n|0.228mg\n|-\n|Iron\n|6.04mg\n|-\n|Magnesium\n|88mg\n|-\n|Manganese\n|0.821mg\n|-\n|Phosphorus\n|159mg\n|-\n|Potassium\n|1870mg\n|-\n|Sodium\n|91mg\n|-\n|Zinc\n|1.02mg\n|-\n|'''Other constituents''' \n|\n|-\n|Water\n|7.15g\n|}\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Food}}\n* [[Ancho]] - The dried form of the [[Poblano chile|poblano chili]].\n* [[Guajillo chile|Guajillo]] - The dried form of the mirasol chili pepper.\n* [[Pasilla]] - The dried form of the chilaca chili pepper.\n* [[List of smoked foods]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{cite book\n| first=Rick\n| last=Bayless\n| authorlink=Rick Bayless\n| author2=Deann Groen Bayless\n| title=Authentic Mexican: Regional Cooking from the Heart of Mexico\n| year=1987\n| pages=[https://archive.org/details/authenticmexican00bayl_0/page/332 332\u2013334]\n| publisher=William Morrow and Company, Inc\n| location=New York\n| isbn=0-688-04394-1\n| url-access=registration\n| url=https://archive.org/details/authenticmexican00bayl_0/page/332\n}}\n* {{cite book\n| first=Dave\n| last=Dewitt\n| authorlink=\n| author2=Chuck Evans\n| title=The Pepper Pantry: Chipotles\n| year=1997\n| page=[https://archive.org/details/pepperpantrychip0000dewi/page/96 96]\n| publisher=Celestial Arts\n| location=\n| isbn=0-89087-828-5\n| url=https://archive.org/details/pepperpantrychip0000dewi/page/96\n}}\n\n\n{{Mexican cuisine}}\n\n[[Category:Chili peppers]]\n[[Category:Mexican cuisine]]\n[[Category:Smoked food]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Smoke-dried jalape\u00f1o}}\n{{about|the food item|the restaurant chain|Chipotle Mexican Grill}}\n{{More footnotes|date=January 2008}}\n{{Infobox pepper\n| image = Capsicum annuum chipotle dried.jpg\n| caption = Chipotles of the ''morita'' variety\n| heat = Medium\n| scoville = 2500\u20138000\n}}\nA '''chipotle''' ({{IPAc-en|t\u0283|\u1d7b|\u02c8|p|o\u028a|t|l|e\u026a}}, {{respell|chi|POHT|lay}}; {{IPA-es|t\u0283i\u02c8potle|lang}}), or '''''chilpotle''''', is a [[smoking (food)|smoke-dried]] ripe [[jalape\u00f1o]] [[chili pepper]] used for seasoning.

This chili pepper is consumed at the rate of 7-9 kg per year, per capita. It is mostly consumed fresh but also in different forms such as pickled, dried and smoked. Jalape\u00f1o varieties differ in size and heat. Typically, a grower passes through a jalape\u00f1o field many times, picking the unripe, green jalape\u00f1os for market. Jalape\u00f1os are green for most of the season but in the fall, which is the end of the growing season, they naturally ripen and turn bright red. In Mexico and the United States there is a growing market for ripe red jalape\u00f1os (the last stage of maturation). They are kept on the bush as long as possible. When they are deep red and have lost much of their moisture, they are picked to be made into chipotles<ref>{{cite web |last1= Moreno-Escamilla |first1= Jes\u00fas Omar |title=Effect of the Smoking Process and Firewood Type in the Phytochemical Content and Antioxidant Capacity of Red Jalape\u00f1o Pepper during Its Transformation to Chipotle Pepper |url= https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963996915301162 |website= Science Direct |date= 26 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nSmoking is a common technique of food preservation that provides a distinctive aroma and flavor, and is traditionally carried out in a field open-oven.{{cn|date=April 2020}} The smoking process can affect structural, chemical and nutritional properties of food.

His name is a pun on the Japanese interjection '''{{nihongo foot|''Oyam\u0101!''|\u304a\u3084\u307e\u3042\uff01|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}''', meaning \"Good heavens!\" His name is also inspired by [[Nintendo]] [[game designer]] Yoshiyuki Oyama.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Inside Zelda |journal=[[Nintendo Power]] |date=March 2006 |volume=201 |pages=&nbsp;46\u201348}}</ref> The English translations accordingly adapted the name to a pun on the expression \"egad\"! His first appearance was in ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]'' for [[Nintendo GameCube]], in which he investigates a haunted mansion that mysteriously appeared by his laboratory. To help him study the ghosts in the mansion, he uses the \"Poltergust 3000\", a high-powered vacuum cleaner that can suck in and capture ghosts, and the \"[[Game Boy Color|Game Boy Horror]]\", an invention for tracking and detecting objects such as Boos. He lends it to Luigi and helps him on his quest. His voice is played by [[Kazumi Totaka]], who also voiced [[Yoshi]].\n\nGadd reprises his supporting role in ''[[Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon]]'' in a remodeled lab to assist Luigi again with his \"Poltergust 5000\" and a \"[[Nintendo DS|Dual Scream]]\", which replaces the Game Boy Horror. The Nintendo 3DS remake of the original ''Luigi\u2019s Mansion'' introduces a new invention: a lime-green doppelg\u00e4nger of Luigi, called \"Gooigi\", which can be brought along as a partner in local co-op play.\n\nIn the third installment, ''[[Luigi's Mansion 3]]'', Gooigi returns and E. Gadd provides Luigi with a new Poltergust model, the \"Poltergust G-00\". Luigi rescues him at the time when his friends were captured by Hellen Gravely at a hotel called The Last Resort.\n\nHe is mentioned in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' but not seen, but his inventions: a '''Flash Liquidizer Ultra Dousing Device''' or \"'''F.L.U.D.D.'''\" and Magic Brush were used by Mario and [[Bowser Jr.]] respectively. E. Gadd also creates a Time Machine in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time]]'' and various inventions as rewards for making bean coffees at the Starbeans Cafe in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'' and its [[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions|3DS remake]]. In ''[[Mario Party 6]]'', E. Gadd is featured on a party board called E. Gadd's Garage.\n\n''[[Super Mario Maker]]'' features E. Gadd as an unlockable ''Mystery Mushroom'' costume, made available through an update.\n\n===Sprixie Princesses===\nThe {{nihongo foot|'''Sprixie Princesses'''|\u3088\u3046\u305b\u3044\u59eb|Y\u014dseihime|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} are the rulers of the Sprixie Kingdom and the Sprixies, a race of [[Fairy|fairies]]. They appear in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''. The green Sprixie Princess is the sole Sprixie Princess and refers to the others as her followers. The green Sprixie Princess first appears when Mario and Luigi find and repair a Clear Pipe. The pipe promptly ejects a large number of items before the princess emerges. The green Sprixie Princess tells the group that the Sprixie Kingdom is in danger, as Bowser had managed to capture the other six princesses and that she had only narrowly escaped his grasp. Moments after she emerges, however, Bowser comes up through the same pipe, leaving her dazed, captures the green Sprixie Princess in a bottle, and retreats down the pipe. The group quickly follows after Bowser in order to rescue the kingdom, and they soon find that each Sprixie Princess is guarded in one of the first seven worlds' castles. Defeating the boss of the castle will reveal a Warp Box that takes the group to a room containing both the Goal Pole and the imprisoned Sprixie.\n\nEach time a Sprixie Princess is saved, she will build a Clear Pipe to the next world with either a hammer or a wrench (with the exception of the red Sprixie Princess, since she was recaptured after she was saved in World Castle (World 7) and she only helped build a rocket ship). It is possible for the player to skip saving the first and fourth Sprixie Princesses if they take the secret exits found in World 1 and World 4, respectively, although as a result they will be entirely absent during the ending and when Bowser recaptures them.\n\nThe group eventually manages to rescue the last of the seven Sprixie Princesses after defeating Bowser in his car for the second time in World Castle (World 7), seemingly the last stage of the game. However, Bowser promptly reappears, stuffs all seven princesses into a larger bottle, and flees to World Bowser (World 8), a Bowser-themed carnival area that serves as the true final world of the main game. Here, Bowser confronts the heroes after transforming into Meowser and is defeated, dropping the Sprixie Princesses in the process. The princesses then use their powers to undo all the harm done to their land before waving goodbye to the heroes as they return to the Mushroom Kingdom via a Clear Pipe.\n\nAfter the ending credits, the Sprixie Princesses build a rocket ship in World 1 for the player to use in order to travel to the secret bonus worlds in outer space (Star, Mushroom, Flower, and Crown).\n\nThe green Sprixie Princess is also playable in ''[[Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash]]''.\n\n===Tiara===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Tiara'''|\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2\u30e9|Tiara|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the secondary damsel in distress in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]''.

They are led by Captain Toad. Later the group would expand to include Toadette, bringing the membership up to six. The members consist of Captain Toad, Toadette, Hint Toad (blue), Yellow Toad, Banktoad (green), and Mailtoad (magenta).\n\n===Toadsworth===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Toadsworth'''|\u30ad\u30ce\u3058\u3044|Kinojii|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is an elderly Toad and Princess Peach's longtime [[Steward (office)|steward]], first appearing in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', when he comes along with Princess Peach and Mario to Isle Delfino. He makes a brief appearance in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'' at the beginning (where he presents Mario and Luigi with a suitcase) and end of the game.\n\nPaper Toadsworth accompanies Paper Princess Peach on her trip to Rogueport during ''[[Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door]]'', keeping Paper Peach very close to him, but ends up losing her.\n\nIn ''[[Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time]]'', he is with Mario and Luigi when Princess Peach takes an experimental trip back in time. He is also included in ''[[Super Princess Peach]]'' where he gives Peach a parasol named Perry in the cinema and is seen as a lead guitarist of the band called Peach Hit Five in the music room.\n\nHe also appears in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story]]'' and its 3DS remake where he was inhaled by Bowser. In ''[[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team]]'', Toadsworth appeared as the gang went on a vacation in Pi'illo Island.\n\nToadsworth makes a brief appearance in ''[[Mario Kart: Double Dash]]'' when the player wins a cup. He acts as an umpire in ''[[Mario Power Tennis]]'' for the [[GameCube]] as well as in the [[remake]] for the [[Wii]], in which Toadsworth reprimands the player when a foul shot is made. In ''[[Mario Party 7]]'', he is a host of the boards. He finally becomes playable in both ''[[Mario Superstar Baseball]]'' and ''[[Mario Super Sluggers]]''.\n\nToadsworth is voiced by [[Charles Martinet]], who also voices [[Mario]], [[Luigi]], [[Wario]] and [[Waluigi]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Fenech |first=Stephen |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/meet-the-voice-of-super-mario-charles-martinet/story-e6frewyr-1225772856617 |title=Meet the voice of Super Mario Charles Martinet |publisher=Dailytelegraph.com.au |date=2009-09-14 |accessdate=2010-08-05}}</ref> N-Philes criticized Toadsworth's voice in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', calling it \"laughable\", \"comical\", and \"utterly pessimistic\".<ref>{{cite web |author=Gareth Trinkwon |url=http://www.n-philes.com/reviews/63/super-mario-sunshine/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120903145402/http://www.n-philes.com/reviews/63/super-mario-sunshine/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-09-03 |title=News :: Super Mario Sunshine |publisher=N-Philes |accessdate=2010-04-08 }}</ref>\n\n==Supporting antagonists==\n===Boom Boom===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Boom Boom'''|\u30d6\u30f3\u30d6\u30f3|Bunbun|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the henchman and faithful servant of Bowser. He first appeared in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' as one of the main antagonists of the game, where he often fights with Mario or Luigi by chasing him flailing his arms, jumping high and flying at them. Boom Boom returned in ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'' 23 years after their last appearance. He resides in various airships where he encounters Mario. In ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'', he reprises his old role from ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', guarding the fortresses and towers.\n\nIn four episodes of ''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', Boom Boom appears as a silent powerhouse who often cause troubles to Mario and Luigi.\n\n===Broodals===\nThe {{nihongo foot|'''Broodals'''|\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30c0\u30eb\u30ba|Bur\u016bdaruzu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} are a group of villainous anthropomorphic [[rabbit]]s who double as wedding planners in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]''. Their boss is Madame Broode. They were hired by Bowser in order to stop Mario from reaching him.

Although in said game only Draggadon, the king of an isolated volcano called Pyropuff Peak, and Gold Draggadon, the king of the Golden Realm.\n\nThe first, named Draggadon, is fought in Episode 1-10: The King of Pyropuff Peak, Episode 2-9: Draggadon's Revenge, and Bonus Episode-11: Mummy-Me at Pyropuff Peak. When Captain Toad is chasing Wingo who kidnapped Toadette, he accidentally comes across Pyropuff Peak. Draggadon attacks him, thinking him to be an intruder, but after the fight realizes that he was innocent, and allows him to ride on his head as the two conquer hordes of enemies. Toadette in her pursuit of Wingo also ends up at Pyropuff Peak, which results in the same situation playing. Once again, Toadette befriends him, and they conquer even more enemies.\n\nUnlike Wingo, Draggadon is not battled directly. Captain Toad and Toadette must avoid his attacks to the end of the level by hiding behind walls, and at the end, knock a pillar on his head. He is then knocked unconscious, and the Toads collect the Power Star. Another Draggadon, named Gold Draggadon, also appears in a later episode, as the king of the Golden Realm. Like Draggadon, Captain Toad must also fight Gold Draggadon as boss, although fireballs will move faster and the lava will rise quicker, and after defeating him, he lets Captain Toad ride him.\n\n===Dry Bowser===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Dry Bowser'''|\u307b\u306d\u30af\u30c3\u30d1|Hone Kuppa|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a recurring antagonist in the ''Mario'' series.

Dry Bowser is a playable character in several of the Mario spin-off games.\n\n===Fawful===\n{{Main|Fawful}}\n\n'''{{nihongo foot|Fawful|\u30b2\u30e9\u30b3\u30d3\u30c3\u30c4|Gerakobittsu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}''', is a recurring antagonist in the ''[[Mario & Luigi]]'' series.

After being defeated by the Star Kid, Twink, she continued to work for him. In ''[[Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door]]'', she acted as Bowser's second-in-command. Generally, her position is very similar with Kamek who appeared earlier than her, which possibly means why she is replaced by him in ''[[Paper Mario: Sticker Star]]''. [[IGN]] rated her as one of the weirdest ''Mario'' characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://au.wii.ign.com/articles/119/1199242p3.html|title=Weirdest Mario Characters|first=Audrey|last=Drake|accessdate=18 September 2016|publisher=IGN}}</ref>\n\n===King Bob-omb===\n{{nihongo foot|'''King Bob-omb'''|\u30dc\u30e0\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0|Bomu Kingu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the king of the Bob-ombs.

In terms of design, Dorrie has a few elements in common with Yoshis, such as the white area of soft tissue spanning the whole lower part of the body and a similar round face that, since ''[[Super Mario 64 DS]]'', even features a placement of the eyes and nostrils akin to that seen in Yoshis.\n\nDorrie returns in ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' and appears in two sizes. Mario can ride on his back to cross large bodies of poison in World 4-1 and World 4-6. If Mario does a Ground Pound on Dorrie, he moves faster through the water.\n\n===Honey Queen===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Honey Queen'''|\u30cf\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u30a4\u30fc\u30f3|Han\u012b Ku\u012bn|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the queen of all the [[Honey bee|Honeybees]]. She is an extremely large bee and always speaks using nosism. She appears in ''Super Mario Galaxy'' and ''Super Mario Galaxy 2'' where she rules over all the Honeybees in the Honeyhive, Honeybloom, and Honeyhop Galaxies, and as a heavyweight unlockable driver in ''[[Mario Kart 7]]''.\n\nShe also appeared in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' as a spirit.\n\n===Nabbit===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Nabbit'''|\u30c8\u30c3\u30c6\u30f3|Totten|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[rabbit]]-like [[thief]] who first appears in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'', where he steals items from Toad Houses and the Mario Bros. have to chase him through various levels to capture him and get them back. He's the main source of P-Acorn powerups, making it worth the player's time to catch him. In ''New Super Luigi U'', he's promoted to Playable as the fourth character available for multiplayer. He returned to ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe]]'' as a fifth playable character along with Toadette, Luigi, Toad and Mario.\n\nHe is a purple rabbit with round eyes, long ears, and black limbs. He also wears a white handkerchief with a drawing of a large mouth with sharpened teeth, similar to Bowser Jr.'s mask (though despite this he does not work for Bowser), as well as orange shoes and white gloves.\n\nNabbit also appeared as a stage hazard in ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' in the Mushroom Kingdom U stage.\n\n===Pauline===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Pauline'''|\u30dd\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3|Por\u012bn|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the [[damsel in distress]] from the original ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'',<ref name=\"ignDK\">{{cite web| title = Donkey Kong| publisher = IGN| url = http://cheats.ign.com/objects/017/017317.html| accessdate = 2010-07-06}}</ref> as well as the [[Donkey Kong (Game Boy)|1994 Game Boy game of the same name]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Donkey Kong| publisher = IGN| url = http://gameboy.ign.com/objects/010/010293.html| accessdate = 2010-07-06}}</ref> She also appeared in ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis]]'' and ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Minis March Again!]]''.

The name Pauline was first given to the character in the ''Donkey Kong'' animated segments shown in the television series ''[[Saturday Supercade]]'' voiced by [[Judy Strangis]].

While the original Pauline was portrayed as a [[blond]]e in a pink gown, this new version of the character was a [[Brown hair|brunette]] who wears a red dress.<ref name=\"ignpauline\" /> Because of her different design, the Pauline in the Game Boy version of ''Donkey Kong'' was initially considered in certain Mario media a separate character from the original incarnation of the character (who was still known as Lady) featured in the arcade and Famicom versions, with the two versions of the character being given separate profiles in Shogakukan's 1994 ''Mario Character Encyclopedia'' book.<ref name=lady_and_pauline>{{cite book|title=\u30d1\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u7248 \u30de\u30ea\u30aa\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u5927\u4e8b\u5178|trans-title=Mario Character Encyclopedia: Perfect Edition|publisher=Shogakukan|date=November 20, 1994|page=24|isbn=4092590679|url=http://i.imgur.com/3OabVR8.jpg}}</ref> However, later games and sources (most notably the Japanese version of ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS]]'') acknowledge that Pauline and Lady are meant to be the same character.<ref name=pauline_trophy_jp>{{cite video game|title=\u5927\u4e71\u95d8\u30b9\u30de\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30d6\u30e9\u30b6\u30fc\u30ba for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U|trans-title=Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U|language=Japanese|quote=\u540d\u524d\u304c\u30ec\u30c7\u30a3? \u30dd\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u3058\u3083\u306a\u304f\u3066? \u306f\u3044\u3001\u30dd\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u3068\u3044\u3046\u540d\u306f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u7248\u304b\u3089|trans-quote=Is her name Lady? or is it, Pauline?

She is a guest VIP at the grand opening of the \"Super Mini Mario World\", a theme park based on Mini-Mario toys, where she is kidnapped by Donkey Kong. She also appears in ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Minis March Again!]]'' for the DSiWare, and ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Mini-Land Mayhem]]'' for the DS, where she is once again kidnapped by Donkey Kong.\n\nPauline returns in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' on the [[Nintendo Switch]] voiced by [[Kate Higgins]].

In the game, it allows the playable characters to ride him through certain levels. Plessie's name is a portmanteau of \"[[Plesiosaurus]]\" and \"Nessie.\" The former is an extinct group of large marine reptiles that are often confused as dinosaurs, whereas the latter is the nickname given to the [[Loch Ness Monster]]. Its design share some features with the design of Yoshis, such as the bipedal posture with short legs, the white soft tissue that spans the lower part of the body, big oval eyes pointing forward which feature a white sclera, the nostrils being hosted near the top of a round protruding end of the upper part of the muzzle, and a crest on the back of the head, although the shape of the latter is different.\n\nPlessie appears in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' as a support spirit.\n\n===Poochy===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Poochy'''|\u30dd\u30c1|Pochi|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is [[Yoshi]]'s pet [[dog]]. Poochy doesn't have any ears or a nose, and he has big lips that look like a [[Duck|duck's]] bill, making him look more like a [[platypus]] than a dog. Poochy is a good swimmer and can sniff out hidden items for Yoshi. Poochy can also do things that Yoshi can't, such as crossing over dangerous terrain, and jumping over walls to give Yoshi a boost out of his wall jumps. Poochy's first appearance was in ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]''.\n\n===Professor E. Gadd===\n'''Professor Elvin Gadd''' ({{nihongo foot|'''Professor Oya M\u0101'''|\u30aa\u30e4\u30fb\u30de\u30fc\u535a\u58eb|Oya M\u0101 Hakase|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} in Japan), more commonly known as '''E. Gadd''', is a [[scientist]] who, with his various inventions, helps Luigi save his brother Mario and  the mansion. His name is a pun on the Japanese interjection '''{{nihongo foot|''Oyam\u0101!''|\u304a\u3084\u307e\u3042\uff01|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}''', meaning \"Good heavens!\" His name is also inspired by [[Nintendo]] [[game designer]] Yoshiyuki Oyama.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Inside Zelda |journal=[[Nintendo Power]] |date=March 2006 |volume=201 |pages=&nbsp;46\u201348}}</ref> The English translations accordingly adapted the name to a pun on the expression \"egad\"! His first appearance was in ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]'' for [[Nintendo GameCube]], in which he investigates a haunted mansion that mysteriously appeared by his laboratory. To help him study the ghosts in the mansion, he uses the \"Poltergust 3000\", a high-powered vacuum cleaner that can suck in and capture ghosts, and the \"[[Game Boy Color|Game Boy Horror]]\", an invention for tracking and detecting objects such as Boos. He lends it to Luigi and helps him on his quest. His voice is played by [[Kazumi Totaka]], who also voiced [[Yoshi]].\n\nGadd reprises his supporting role in ''[[Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon]]'' in a remodeled lab to assist Luigi again with his \"Poltergust 5000\" and a \"[[Nintendo DS|Dual Scream]]\", which replaces the Game Boy Horror. The Nintendo 3DS remake of the original ''Luigi\u2019s Mansion'' introduces a new invention: a lime-green doppelg\u00e4nger of Luigi, called \"Gooigi\", which can be brought along as a partner in local co-op play.\n\nIn the third installment, ''[[Luigi's Mansion 3]]'', Gooigi returns and E. Gadd provides Luigi with a new Poltergust model, the \"Poltergust G-00\". Luigi rescues him at the time when his friends were captured by Hellen Gravely at a hotel called The Last Resort.\n\nHe is mentioned in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' but not seen, but his inventions: a '''Flash Liquidizer Ultra Dousing Device''' or \"'''F.L.U.D.D.'''\" and Magic Brush were used by Mario and [[Bowser Jr.]] respectively. E. Gadd also creates a Time Machine in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time]]'' and various inventions as rewards for making bean coffees at the Starbeans Cafe in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'' and its [[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions|3DS remake]]. In ''[[Mario Party 6]]'', E. Gadd is featured on a party board called E. Gadd's Garage.\n\n''[[Super Mario Maker]]'' features E. Gadd as an unlockable ''Mystery Mushroom'' costume, made available through an update.\n\n===Sprixie Princesses===\nThe {{nihongo foot|'''Sprixie Princesses'''|\u3088\u3046\u305b\u3044\u59eb|Y\u014dseihime|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} are the rulers of the Sprixie Kingdom and the Sprixies, a race of [[Fairy|fairies]]. They appear in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''. The green Sprixie Princess is the sole Sprixie Princess and refers to the others as her followers. The green Sprixie Princess first appears when Mario and Luigi find and repair a Clear Pipe. The pipe promptly ejects a large number of items before the princess emerges. The green Sprixie Princess tells the group that the Sprixie Kingdom is in danger, as Bowser had managed to capture the other six princesses and that she had only narrowly escaped his grasp. Moments after she emerges, however, Bowser comes up through the same pipe, leaving her dazed, captures the green Sprixie Princess in a bottle, and retreats down the pipe. The group quickly follows after Bowser in order to rescue the kingdom, and they soon find that each Sprixie Princess is guarded in one of the first seven worlds' castles. Defeating the boss of the castle will reveal a Warp Box that takes the group to a room containing both the Goal Pole and the imprisoned Sprixie.\n\nEach time a Sprixie Princess is saved, she will build a Clear Pipe to the next world with either a hammer or a wrench (with the exception of the red Sprixie Princess, since she was recaptured after she was saved in World Castle (World 7) and she only helped build a rocket ship). It is possible for the player to skip saving the first and fourth Sprixie Princesses if they take the secret exits found in World 1 and World 4, respectively, although as a result they will be entirely absent during the ending and when Bowser recaptures them.\n\nThe group eventually manages to rescue the last of the seven Sprixie Princesses after defeating Bowser in his car for the second time in World Castle (World 7), seemingly the last stage of the game. However, Bowser promptly reappears, stuffs all seven princesses into a larger bottle, and flees to World Bowser (World 8), a Bowser-themed carnival area that serves as the true final world of the main game. Here, Bowser confronts the heroes after transforming into Meowser and is defeated, dropping the Sprixie Princesses in the process. The princesses then use their powers to undo all the harm done to their land before waving goodbye to the heroes as they return to the Mushroom Kingdom via a Clear Pipe.\n\nAfter the ending credits, the Sprixie Princesses build a rocket ship in World 1 for the player to use in order to travel to the secret bonus worlds in outer space (Star, Mushroom, Flower, and Crown).\n\nThe green Sprixie Princess is also playable in ''[[Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash]]''.\n\n===Tiara===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Tiara'''|\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2\u30e9|Tiara|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the secondary damsel in distress in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]''. She is the sister of Cappy, who is kidnapped by [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] as a gift to [[Princess Peach]] to wear on their wedding day.\n\n===Toad Brigade===\nThe {{nihongo foot|'''Toad Brigade'''|\u30ad\u30ce\u30d4\u30aa\u63a2\u691c\u968a|Kinopio Tankentai|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a group of five Toads that aid Mario through some games, starting with ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]''. They are led by Captain Toad. Later the group would expand to include Toadette, bringing the membership up to six. The members consist of Captain Toad, Toadette, Hint Toad (blue), Yellow Toad, Banktoad (green), and Mailtoad (magenta).\n\n===Toadsworth===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Toadsworth'''|\u30ad\u30ce\u3058\u3044|Kinojii|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is an elderly Toad and Princess Peach's longtime [[Steward (office)|steward]], first appearing in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', when he comes along with Princess Peach and Mario to Isle Delfino. He makes a brief appearance in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'' at the beginning (where he presents Mario and Luigi with a suitcase) and end of the game.\n\nPaper Toadsworth accompanies Paper Princess Peach on her trip to Rogueport during ''[[Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door]]'', keeping Paper Peach very close to him, but ends up losing her.\n\nIn ''[[Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time]]'', he is with Mario and Luigi when Princess Peach takes an experimental trip back in time. He is also included in ''[[Super Princess Peach]]'' where he gives Peach a parasol named Perry in the cinema and is seen as a lead guitarist of the band called Peach Hit Five in the music room.\n\nHe also appears in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story]]'' and its 3DS remake where he was inhaled by Bowser. In ''[[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team]]'', Toadsworth appeared as the gang went on a vacation in Pi'illo Island.\n\nToadsworth makes a brief appearance in ''[[Mario Kart: Double Dash]]'' when the player wins a cup. He acts as an umpire in ''[[Mario Power Tennis]]'' for the [[GameCube]] as well as in the [[remake]] for the [[Wii]], in which Toadsworth reprimands the player when a foul shot is made. In ''[[Mario Party 7]]'', he is a host of the boards. He finally becomes playable in both ''[[Mario Superstar Baseball]]'' and ''[[Mario Super Sluggers]]''.\n\nToadsworth is voiced by [[Charles Martinet]], who also voices [[Mario]], [[Luigi]], [[Wario]] and [[Waluigi]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Fenech |first=Stephen |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/meet-the-voice-of-super-mario-charles-martinet/story-e6frewyr-1225772856617 |title=Meet the voice of Super Mario Charles Martinet |publisher=Dailytelegraph.com.au |date=2009-09-14 |accessdate=2010-08-05}}</ref> N-Philes criticized Toadsworth's voice in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', calling it \"laughable\", \"comical\", and \"utterly pessimistic\".<ref>{{cite web |author=Gareth Trinkwon |url=http://www.n-philes.com/reviews/63/super-mario-sunshine/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120903145402/http://www.n-philes.com/reviews/63/super-mario-sunshine/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-09-03 |title=News :: Super Mario Sunshine |publisher=N-Philes |accessdate=2010-04-08 }}</ref>\n\n==Supporting antagonists==\n===Boom Boom===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Boom Boom'''|\u30d6\u30f3\u30d6\u30f3|Bunbun|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the henchman and faithful servant of Bowser. He first appeared in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' as one of the main antagonists of the game, where he often fights with Mario or Luigi by chasing him flailing his arms, jumping high and flying at them. Boom Boom returned in ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'' 23 years after their last appearance. He resides in various airships where he encounters Mario. In ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'', he reprises his old role from ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', guarding the fortresses and towers.\n\nIn four episodes of ''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', Boom Boom appears as a silent powerhouse who often cause troubles to Mario and Luigi.\n\n===Broodals===\nThe {{nihongo foot|'''Broodals'''|\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30c0\u30eb\u30ba|Bur\u016bdaruzu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} are a group of villainous anthropomorphic [[rabbit]]s who double as wedding planners in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]''. Their boss is Madame Broode. They were hired by Bowser in order to stop Mario from reaching him. The members consist of Topper, Hariet, Rango and Spewart.\n\n===Draggadon===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Draggadons'''|\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30c9\u30f3|Doragodon|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} are [[dragon]]s first appearing in the game ''[[Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker]]''. Although in said game only Draggadon, the king of an isolated volcano called Pyropuff Peak, and Gold Draggadon, the king of the Golden Realm.\n\nThe first, named Draggadon, is fought in Episode 1-10: The King of Pyropuff Peak, Episode 2-9: Draggadon's Revenge, and Bonus Episode-11: Mummy-Me at Pyropuff Peak. When Captain Toad is chasing Wingo who kidnapped Toadette, he accidentally comes across Pyropuff Peak. Draggadon attacks him, thinking him to be an intruder, but after the fight realizes that he was innocent, and allows him to ride on his head as the two conquer hordes of enemies. Toadette in her pursuit of Wingo also ends up at Pyropuff Peak, which results in the same situation playing. Once again, Toadette befriends him, and they conquer even more enemies.\n\nUnlike Wingo, Draggadon is not battled directly. Captain Toad and Toadette must avoid his attacks to the end of the level by hiding behind walls, and at the end, knock a pillar on his head. He is then knocked unconscious, and the Toads collect the Power Star. Another Draggadon, named Gold Draggadon, also appears in a later episode, as the king of the Golden Realm. Like Draggadon, Captain Toad must also fight Gold Draggadon as boss, although fireballs will move faster and the lava will rise quicker, and after defeating him, he lets Captain Toad ride him.\n\n===Dry Bowser===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Dry Bowser'''|\u307b\u306d\u30af\u30c3\u30d1|Hone Kuppa|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a recurring antagonist in the ''Mario'' series. Debuting as a form of Bowser after losing his flesh in ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'', the character has appeared as his own being starting with ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'', often serving as the final antagonist in the main games. In ''[[Mario Party: Island Tour]]'', Bowser refers to Dry Bowser as a \"close family friend\". Dry Bowser is a playable character in several of the Mario spin-off games.\n\n===Fawful===\n{{Main|Fawful}}\n\n'''{{nihongo foot|Fawful|\u30b2\u30e9\u30b3\u30d3\u30c3\u30c4|Gerakobittsu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}''', is a recurring antagonist in the ''[[Mario & Luigi]]'' series. The character is considered to be \"insane,\" often serving as or the sidekick to the main antagonist in the games.\n\n===Foreman Spike===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Foreman Spike'''|\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc|Burakk\u012b|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the angry [[Construction foreman|foreman]] of the construction site where Mario and Luigi worked in ''[[Wrecking Crew (video game)|Wrecking Crew]]''. Rather than help them, Spike continuously tried to hinder the brothers from doing their job. He is a bearded villain who always wears sunglasses, although in ''Wrecking Crew '98'', he did not have a beard.\n\n===Ghosts from ''Luigi's Mansion''===\nThere are different ghosts that appears in ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]'' and its sequels where Luigi has to catch them with the Poltergust 3000 and hand them over to Professor E. Gadd to be placed in their portraits:\n\n====Appearing in ''Luigi's Mansion''====\nThe following ghosts appear in ''Luigi's Mansion'' in order of appearance:\n\n* '''Neville''' - The bookish father who spends his afterlife reading books.

She possesses the usual Magikoopa powers, and is primarily distinguished by her ability to summon yellow blocks, which she has used to both impede and combat Mario. She first appeared in ''[[Paper Mario]]'' for the Nintendo 64, helping Bowser by leaving enemies in Mario's way, transporting Bowser into the Star Spirit Sanctuary, and augmenting his size and power in the final battle. After being defeated by the Star Kid, Twink, she continued to work for him. In ''[[Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door]]'', she acted as Bowser's second-in-command. Generally, her position is very similar with Kamek who appeared earlier than her, which possibly means why she is replaced by him in ''[[Paper Mario: Sticker Star]]''. [[IGN]] rated her as one of the weirdest ''Mario'' characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://au.wii.ign.com/articles/119/1199242p3.html|title=Weirdest Mario Characters|first=Audrey|last=Drake|accessdate=18 September 2016|publisher=IGN}}</ref>\n\n===King Bob-omb===\n{{nihongo foot|'''King Bob-omb'''|\u30dc\u30e0\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0|Bomu Kingu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the king of the Bob-ombs. He is mostly recognized for being the first boss fought in the game ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and its remake. Guarding the Power Star, which Bowser entrusted him with, he does not give it up without fighting the player. After his debut, King Bob-omb became a recurring boss in later games, specifically spin-off games such as ''[[Mario Party 9]]'' and ''[[Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam]]''. King Bob-omb, like other certain bosses, takes pride in his royal status.\n\n===King Boo===\n{{nihongo foot|'''King Boo'''|\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0\u30c6\u30ec\u30b5|Kingu Teresa|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the main antagonist of the ''Luigi's Mansion'' series and the [[archenemy]] of [[Luigi]]. He plays minor roles in various other ''[[Mario]]'' games, including the ''[[Mario Kart]]'' and ''[[Mario Party]]'' series. King Boo's first major role was as the final boss of ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]'', where he disguised himself as Bowser. King Boo is a member of the [[Boo (character)|Boo]] species. He is much larger than the average Boos that appear in games after ''Luigi's Mansion''. He dons a [[crown (headgear)|crown]] with a large ruby (as well as glowing, sunken eyes) in his appearances in the ''Luigi's Mansion'' franchise, as well as an appearance as a playable character in ''[[Mario Kart Tour]]'', but he wears a regular crown and has the eyes and face of a regular Boo in all other appearances. Previously, a similar character named '''Big Boo''' appeared as an enemy in ''[[Super Mario World]]'' and as a boss in ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]'' and ''[[Super Mario 64 DS]]''.

Whereas normal Piranha Plants usually grow from pipes, Petey's leaves and roots have grown into foot-like and arm-like appendages, which allows him to use objects such as [[tennis racket]]s and [[golf club]]s. He can also use his leaves to fly around in the air. He first appeared as the primary boss of Bianco Hills in the game ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]''.

In the game, she serves as an Airship boss, where she flips around the arena, throwing [[boomerang]]s with pink bows on them at Mario or Luigi. The arena is different in each boss fight. In the game's seventh world, she fights alongside her partner Boom Boom. Pom Pom is depicted as malicious towards the player, though she is seen winking in a flirty way before every battle. She returned in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'', though her boomerang appears to be replaced by some sort of [[shuriken]]. Pom Pom is playable as an unlockable character in ''[[Super Mario Party]]''.\n\n===Reznor===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Reznor'''|\u30d6\u30a4\u30d6\u30a4|Buibui|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} are [[fire]]-breathing [[Triceratops]] that made their debut in ''[[Super Mario World]]''.

S. Lewis]]'s ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' series. She is the youngest of the four Pevensie children, and the first to find the Wardrobe entrance to [[The Chronicles of Narnia|Narnia]] in ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]''. Of all the Pevensie children, Lucy is the closest to [[Aslan]]. Also, of all the humans who have visited Narnia, Lucy is perhaps the one that believes in Narnia the most. She is ultimately crowned '''Queen Lucy the Valiant''', co-ruler of Narnia along with her two brothers and her sister. Lucy is the central character of the four siblings in the novels. Lucy is a principal character in three of the seven books (''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', ''[[Prince Caspian]]'', and ''[[The Voyage of the Dawn Treader]]''), and a minor character in two others (''[[The Horse and His Boy]]'' and ''[[The Last Battle]]'').\n\nLucy is portrayed by [[Georgie Henley]] in the 2005 film ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'' and she returned to reprise her role in the 2008 film ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian]]''.<ref name=\"pc-return\">{{cite news | title = Caspian to be second Narnia movie | publisher = BBC | date = 2006-01-18 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4625478.stm | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref> Georgie's elder sister, Rachael Henley, portrays the older Queen Lucy at the end of the first film.\nGeorgie Henley also reprised her role in the 2010 film ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader]]'', which is the third of the film series.\n\nThe character of Lucy Pevensie was inspired by [[June Flewett]],<ref name=\"narnia11\">[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/12/11/narnia11.xml The Daily Telegraph], 11 December 2005.</ref> a devout Catholic London girl [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuated]] by her convent to [[The Kilns]], [[C.

Norton & Company}}</ref> and named after Lewis' goddaughter [[Lucy Barfield]], to whom he dedicated ''The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe''. Lucy is described in the book as being fair-haired: \"But as for Lucy, she was always gay and golden-haired, and all princes in those parts desired her to be their Queen, and her people called her Queen Lucy the Valiant.\"<ref>Lewis, C.S. \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\", p. 201</ref>\n\nLucy was the most faithful of the four and the closest to Aslan, and never stopped believing in Narnia. She and her brothers Peter and Edmund, after dying in a train crash in England, were transported to [[Aslan's Country]] with the other Narnians.\n\n==Character==\nLucy is the most sensitive and faithful out of all her siblings; which is why she is written as seeing Aslan across the gorge in [[Prince Caspian]] and her brothers and sister written as cynical and less inclined to go on blind faith. As a young child in [[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]] in a strange house without her mother about, she is also extremely vulnerable and is looking for security, wonder and something to believe in. She is teased mercilessly by Edmund about Narnia, being accused of playing \"childish games\". Once she ''knows'' he also has visited the land in the wardrobe and he ''still'' maintains that they were only playing a game, her anguish knows no bounds, as her faith in humanity and the security of her own beliefs about her siblings are now also under threat.\n\nLucy loves animals, and befriends many creatures, and is devastated in [[Prince Caspian]] to discover that not only has Narnia been invaded by the Telmarines; but that they have suppressed the many creatures and divine and semi-divine beings that made Narnia the extraordinary place it was. Her heartfelt night-time roam through the woods, craving to see the tree spirits dance and share in their communion with nature and life once again is one of the very deep moments of love, hope and disappointment that we share with Lucy in her spiritual journey. Lucy also never stops believing in Narnia and is full of courage because of her faith; and is thus more adventurous than her sister Susan. Lucy has a great desire to help others, which is symbolized by the healing cordial that was given to her by Father Christmas for others in need and only with sparing use. The lesson from Aslan on the battlefield in [[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]] is to use this power impartially and not dwell on the needs of those she loves most.\n\n==='' The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe''===\nLucy's siblings, [[Peter Pevensie|Peter]], [[Susan Pevensie|Susan]] and [[Edmund Pevensie|Edmund]], do not believe her about Narnia at first, but later they all find their way to Narnia.\n\nLucy is the first of the Pevensies to enter Narnia through a magical wardrobe in the Professor's old house, into Narnia in the One Hundred Year Winter, under the rule of the White Witch, the evil self-proclaimed Queen of Narnia. There she meets [[Mr. Tumnus|Mr. Tumnus the Faun]] and, then later, the Beavers. However, her brother Edmund had also slipped into Narnia on the second occasion Lucy had entered, and encountered the White Witch while she was visiting Mr. Tumnus. Edmund, who had already jeered at Lucy about her \"magical\" country, continued to be spiteful towards Lucy by denying that either of them had been in Narnia. When the children all enter Narnia, Edmund slips away from the house of the Beavers and defects to the White Witch.\n\nWhile travelling with Peter, Susan and Mr. and Mrs. Beaver to the Stone Table, they meet [[Father Christmas]], who gives them gifts. Lucy is given a vial with magical [[Cordial (medicine)|cordial]] that can heal almost any injury, and a small [[dagger]] with which to defend herself \"a great need\". Edmund, meanwhile, had tried to betray the Beavers and joined the White Witch; he had first met her and been seduced by promises of power after first entering the wardrobe when trying to follow Lucy on her second entry to Narnia.\n\nShe and her companions arrive at Aslan's camp, and later that night, she and Susan comfort Aslan as he walks to his death \u2013 although they don't know of his fate at the time. Both girls also witness his sacrifice. While their brothers are going to war, Lucy and her sister see [[Aslan]] come back to life and help him wake the creatures in the White Witch's castle, which the White Witch had turned to stone. They meet with their brothers at the end of the battle.\n\nAt [[Cair Paravel]], she is crowned as Her Majesty Queen Lucy by Aslan to the throne as co-ruler of Narnia, this marking the fulfilling of the ancient prophecy and the end of the White Witch's reign. During her reign, she is named Queen Lucy the Valiant. She and her siblings make a Golden Age in Narnia.\n\nYears later, while hunting the White Stag through Lantern Waste, she and her siblings notice the lantern where she met Mr. Tumnus. The Pevensies return through the wardrobe into England, where no time has passed and they are children again.\n\n===''The Horse and His Boy''===\nThe events in ''[[The Horse and His Boy]]'' take place after the siblings are crowned, and before they return to England, in ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'', and Queen Lucy is a young woman who rides to the aid of [[Narnia (world)#Archenland|Archenland]]. She is described by [[List of The Chronicles of Narnia characters#C|Prince Corin]] as being more like a tomboy, unlike her sister, Queen Susan, who is a \"proper lady\". She helps King Lune to welcome Aravis to Anvard and helps to get Aravis's room and clothes ready.\n\n===''Prince Caspian''===\nLucy (who is now 9) travels to Narnia again with her three siblings in ''[[Prince Caspian]]''. In that book, Lucy is the only one to see Aslan at first, and she has a terrible time convincing her brothers and sister as well as Trumpkin the dwarf that he had returned, echoing her trials early in the first book. However, Edmund believes her and backs her up, due to her being right about Narnia itself existing. Aslan tells her to try again and says that she must follow him alone if they refuse to come with her. Lucy comments that Aslan has grown larger, but really she is the one that has grown.\n\n===''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader''===\nWhile Susan travels with Mr. and Mrs. Pevensie to America and Peter studies with Professor [[Digory Kirke]], Lucy (age 11), Edmund and their cousin [[Eustace Scrubb|Eustace]] are drawn into Narnia through a magical painting in [[The Voyage of the Dawn Treader|'' The Voyage of the'' Dawn Treader]]. This is very much Lucy's book, written largely from her point of view.

S. Lewis]]'s ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' series. She is the youngest of the four Pevensie children, and the first to find the Wardrobe entrance to [[The Chronicles of Narnia|Narnia]] in ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]''. Of all the Pevensie children, Lucy is the closest to [[Aslan]]. Also, of all the humans who have visited Narnia, Lucy is perhaps the one that believes in Narnia the most. She is ultimately crowned '''Queen Lucy the Valiant''', co-ruler of Narnia along with her two brothers and her sister. Lucy is the central character of the four siblings in the novels. Lucy is a principal character in three of the seven books (''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', ''[[Prince Caspian]]'', and ''[[The Voyage of the Dawn Treader]]''), and a minor character in two others (''[[The Horse and His Boy]]'' and ''[[The Last Battle]]'').\n\nLucy is portrayed by [[Georgie Henley]] in the 2005 film ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'' and she returned to reprise her role in the 2008 film ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian]]''.<ref name=\"pc-return\">{{cite news | title = Caspian to be second Narnia movie | publisher = BBC | date = 2006-01-18 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4625478.stm | accessdate = 2006-12-01 }}</ref> Georgie's elder sister, Rachael Henley, portrays the older Queen Lucy at the end of the first film.\nGeorgie Henley also reprised her role in the 2010 film ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader]]'', which is the third of the film series.\n\nThe character of Lucy Pevensie was inspired by [[June Flewett]],<ref name=\"narnia11\">[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/12/11/narnia11.xml The Daily Telegraph], 11 December 2005.</ref> a devout Catholic London girl [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuated]] by her convent to [[The Kilns]], [[C.

Norton & Company}}</ref> and named after Lewis' goddaughter [[Lucy Barfield]], to whom he dedicated ''The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe''. Lucy is described in the book as being fair-haired: \"But as for Lucy, she was always gay and golden-haired, and all princes in those parts desired her to be their Queen, and her people called her Queen Lucy the Valiant.\"<ref>Lewis, C.S. \"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\", p. 201</ref>\n\nLucy was the most faithful of the four and the closest to Aslan, and never stopped believing in Narnia. She and her brothers Peter and Edmund, after dying in a train crash in England, were transported to [[Aslan's Country]] with the other Narnians.\n\n==Character==\nLucy is the most sensitive and faithful out of all her siblings; which is why she is written as seeing Aslan across the gorge in [[Prince Caspian]] and her brothers and sister written as cynical and less inclined to go on blind faith. As a young child in [[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]] in a strange house without her mother about, she is also extremely vulnerable and is looking for security, wonder and something to believe in. She is teased mercilessly by Edmund about Narnia, being accused of playing \"childish games\". Once she ''knows'' he also has visited the land in the wardrobe and he ''still'' maintains that they were only playing a game, her anguish knows no bounds, as her faith in humanity and the security of her own beliefs about her siblings are now also under threat.\n\nLucy loves animals, and befriends many creatures, and is devastated in [[Prince Caspian]] to discover that not only has Narnia been invaded by the Telmarines; but that they have suppressed the many creatures and divine and semi-divine beings that made Narnia the extraordinary place it was. Her heartfelt night-time roam through the woods, craving to see the tree spirits dance and share in their communion with nature and life once again is one of the very deep moments of love, hope and disappointment that we share with Lucy in her spiritual journey. Lucy also never stops believing in Narnia and is full of courage because of her faith; and is thus more adventurous than her sister Susan. Lucy has a great desire to help others, which is symbolized by the healing cordial that was given to her by Father Christmas for others in need and only with sparing use. The lesson from Aslan on the battlefield in [[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]] is to use this power impartially and not dwell on the needs of those she loves most.\n\n==='' The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe''===\nLucy's siblings, [[Peter Pevensie|Peter]], [[Susan Pevensie|Susan]] and [[Edmund Pevensie|Edmund]], do not believe her about Narnia at first, but later they all find their way to Narnia.\n\nLucy is the first of the Pevensies to enter Narnia through a magical wardrobe in the Professor's old house, into Narnia in the One Hundred Year Winter, under the rule of the White Witch, the evil self-proclaimed Queen of Narnia.

Edmund, who had already jeered at Lucy about her \"magical\" country, continued to be spiteful towards Lucy by denying that either of them had been in Narnia. When the children all enter Narnia, Edmund slips away from the house of the Beavers and defects to the White Witch.\n\nWhile travelling with Peter, Susan and Mr. and Mrs. Beaver to the Stone Table, they meet [[Father Christmas]], who gives them gifts. Lucy is given a vial with magical [[Cordial (medicine)|cordial]] that can heal almost any injury, and a small [[dagger]] with which to defend herself \"a great need\". Edmund, meanwhile, had tried to betray the Beavers and joined the White Witch; he had first met her and been seduced by promises of power after first entering the wardrobe when trying to follow Lucy on her second entry to Narnia.\n\nShe and her companions arrive at Aslan's camp, and later that night, she and Susan comfort Aslan as he walks to his death \u2013 although they don't know of his fate at the time.

This is very much Lucy's book, written largely from her point of view. However, in the end, Aslan firmly tells her and Edmund that they have become, like Susan and Peter, too old to further experience the wonders of Narnia.\n\n===''The Last Battle''===\nIn ''[[The Last Battle]]'', she plays a minor part as she returns to Narnia again with her brothers, High King Peter and King Edmund, along with Eustace Scrubb, Jill Pole, Polly Plummer, and Digory Kirke. There, she witnesses the destruction of Narnia and lives in the new Narnia created by Aslan. In the new Narnia, all the people and animals who lived in the previous Narnia during its existence return and join together. Lucy also meets her old friend [[Mr. Tumnus|Mr. Tumnus]] the [[Faun]] again, and Aslan tells her about a railway accident that occurs in England in which she, her brothers, her parents, Polly, Digory, Eustace and Jill die. She and Digory, Polly, Peter, Edmund, Eustace and Jill stay in Aslan's homeland for eternity, however, Susan remains living on Earth, her final fate undetermined.\n\n==Portrayals==\n* In the 1980s [[The Chronicles of Narnia (TV serial)|BBC serial]], Lucy is portrayed by English actress [[Sophie Wilcox]].\n* In [[Walden Media]]'s ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia (film series)|The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' films, Lucy is portrayed by English actress [[Georgie Henley]] as a child and Rachael Henley (her older sister) as an adult.\n\n==Other appearances==\nAlthough reviews of ''The Oz/Wonderland Chronicles'' issue 0 indicated that [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]], [[Wendy Darling]] and [[Dorothy Gale]] shared their dorm with [[Susan Pevensie]], a recent review of the now-released issue 1 indicates many fans are believing this is actually meant to be Lucy and not Susan.\n\nShe is spoofed in the 2007 film ''[[Epic Movie]]'', played by [[Jayma Mays]].\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Speculative fiction}}\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{Citation|surname1=Ford|given1=Paul|authorlink=Paul F.
