Meanwhile, Wayne plays the Ghostface to Chainz' Raekwon, bringing an unpredictable and unmatched energy to each of his appearances, but with just enough restraint to keep him on the same page as his collaborator. Not every punch lands directly, but when the two rappers find the sweet spot of their compatibility (the punchline one-upmanship of \"Bounce\" or the perfect ad-lib dynamic of \"Blue C-Note\") it brings out the best of both artists.

It was released on March 4, 2016, by [[Def Jam Recordings]]. The album was originally a collaborative effort between 2 Chainz and fellow American [[Rapping|rapper]] [[Lil Wayne]], but due to his record label issues, only 2 Chainz was credited as the primary artist.\n\nThe album includes [[Hip hop production|production]] from several high-profile record producers; such as [[Southside (record producer)|Southside]], [[Mike Will Made It]], [[TM88]], [[Infamous (producer)|Infamous]], [[Zaytoven]], [[Lil' C (record producer)|Lil' C]], [[Metro Boomin]], Ben Billions and [[London on da Track]], among others. ''ColleGrove'' received generally positive reviews from critics and it debuted at number four on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. A sequel, ''ColleGrove 2'' is set for release in 2020.<ref name=\"ColleGrove 2 RapUp>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rap-up.com/2020/03/27/2-chainz-lil-wayne-collegrove-2/amp/|title=2 Chainz Says 'ColleGrove 2' with Lil Wayne Is Dropping This Year|website=[[Rap-Up]]|date=March 27, 2020|accessdate=March 29, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n''ColleGrove'' was initially a duet album between [[Southern hip hop]] recording artists 2 Chainz and [[Lil Wayne]], however, because of Wayne's label issues, which had prevented him from releasing collaborative efforts in the past, such as ''I Can't Feel My Face'' with [[Juelz Santana]], ''Best of Young Worlds'' with [[Lloyd (singer)|Lloyd]], ''He Rap, He Sing'' with [[T-Pain]] and more, this album does not credit Wayne as a primary artist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hiphopdx.com/editorials/id.3140/title.no-ceilings-5-lil-wayne-collaborative-albums-well-never-see|title=No Ceilings: 5 Lil Wayne Collaborative Albums We'll Never See|author=HipHopDX|date=9 December 2015|work=HipHopDX}}</ref> Although it could not be released in conjunction with their respective record labels, 2 Chainz took it upon himself to release the album as his latest solo project through [[Def Jam Recordings]].

''[[The New York Times]]'' spoke on Wayne's involvement on the project  \"His best verses here are his most spirited rapping in at least two years. Consider the context, though. \u201cCollegrove\u201d isn't even a full collaborative album, but a 2 Chainz album on which he plays sidekick. (There it is in the credits: \u201cLil Wayne appears courtesy of Cash Money Records Inc.\u201d) 2 Chainz is an ornery rapper, occasionally stumbling into vivid word clouds. Every time he heads in an unexpected direction here, Lil Wayne seems eager to step up to the challenge. Even his throwaway lines \u2014 \u201cAsinine/ I get blow like dandelions\u201d \u2014 have the eyebrow-arching zing of his prime. Maybe some time away from the spotlight has calmed him. Maybe the seeming d\u00e9tente in his relationship with Baby has freed him. Or maybe appearing on someone else's album, rather than his own, has allowed him to be loose once more.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/07/arts/music/kendrick-lamar-and-lil-wayne-each-sidestep-the-traditional-album-cycle.html|title=Kendrick Lamar and Lil Wayne Each Sidestep the Traditional Album Cycle|date=7 March 2016|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nPatrick Lyons of HotNewHipHop described it as 'A trap buddy comedy' and Trevor Smith said, \"Throughout his many memorable features, 2 Chainz has generally been recruited as the wild card, but on \"Collegrove,\" he's the straight man, keeping the project together with his reliable ear for beats and earworm-driven songwriting. Meanwhile, Wayne plays the Ghostface to Chainz' Raekwon, bringing an unpredictable and unmatched energy to each of his appearances, but with just enough restraint to keep him on the same page as his collaborator. Not every punch lands directly, but when the two rappers find the sweet spot of their compatibility (the punchline one-upmanship of \"Bounce\" or the perfect ad-lib dynamic of \"Blue C-Note\") it brings out the best of both artists. Both Wayne and Chainz have been known to giggle at their own wordplay, and anytime the pure unfiltered joy they find in rapping is audible on the album, everyone wins.\" awarding the album 79/100.<ref name=\"patricklyons\"/>\n\n[[Stereogum]] awarded the album Album of the Week.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1864053/album-of-the-week-2-chainz-lil-wayne-collegrove/franchises/album-of-the-week/|title=Album Of The Week: 2 Chainz & Lil Wayne ColleGrove|work=Stereogum}}</ref>\n\n== Commercial performance ==\n''ColleGrove'' debuted at number four on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], earning 53,000 equivalent album units, 34,000 copies being pure album sales, for the week ending March 10, 2016.<ref name=\"bb200debut\">{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7256257/kendrick-lamar-untitled-album-no-1-billboard-200 | title=Kendrick Lamar's Surprise 'Untitled' Album Debuts at No. 1 on Billboard 200 Chart | work=Billboard | accessdate=March 13, 2016 |date=March 13, 2016 |first1=Keith|last1=Caulfield}}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{tracklist\n| headline = Standard edition\n| extra_column = Producer(s)\n\n| title1 = Dedication\n| writer1 = {{hlist|[[2 Chainz|Tauheed Epps]]|[[Southside (record producer)|Joshua Luellen]]|[[Mike Dean (record producer)|Michael Dean]]}}\n| extra1 = {{hlist|[[Southside (record producer)|Southside]]|Dean{{ref|a|[a]}}}}\n| length1 = 4:59\n\n| title2 = Smell Like Money\n| note2 = featuring [[Lil Wayne]]\n| writer2 = {{hlist|Epps|[[Lil Wayne|Dwayne Carter, Jr.]]|[[Honorable C.N.O.T.E.|Carlton Mays, Jr.]]}}\n| extra2 = [[Honorable C.N.O.T.E.]]\n| length2 = 4:50\n\n| title3 = Bounce \n| note3 = featuring Lil Wayne\n| writer3 = {{hlist|Epps|Carter, Jr.|[[Infamous (producer)|Marco Rodriguez-Diaz]]|Terry Bourgeois}}\n| extra3 = {{hlist|[[Infamous (producer)|Infamous]]|T@}}\n| length3 = 4:16\n\n| title4 = Gotta Lotta\n| writer4 = {{hlist|Epps|Carter, Jr.|[[Mannie Fresh|Byron Thomas]]|[[Scatman John|John Larkin]]|[[Antonio Catania]]}}\n| note4 = featuring Lil Wayne\n| extra4 = [[Mannie Fresh]]\n| length4 = 3:36\n\n| title5 = MFN Right\n| writer5 = {{hlist|Epps|[[Mike Will Made It|Michael Williams]]|[[Zaytoven|Xavier Dotson]]}}\n| extra5 = {{hlist|[[Mike Will Made It]]|[[Zaytoven]]}}\n| length5 = 3:25\n\n| title6 = Blue C-Note\n| writer6 = {{hlist|Epps|Carter, Jr.|Nosakhere Andrews}}\n| note6 = featuring Lil Wayne\n| extra6 = Mr. 2-17\n| length6 = 2:51\n\n| title7 = Not Invited\n| writer7 = {{hlist|Epps|[[TM88|Bryan Simmons]]|Richaud Daughtry|Robert Walker}}\n| extra7 = {{hlist|[[TM88]]|Reignman Rich}}\n| length7 = 3:17\n\n| title8 = Bentley Truck\n| note8 = featuring Lil Wayne\n| writer8 = {{hlist|Epps|Carter, Jr.|[[Metro Boomin|Leland Wayne]]|[[Frank Dukes|Adam Feeney]]}}\n| extra8 ={{hlist|[[Metro Boomin]]|[[Frank Dukes]]}}\n| length8 = 4:39\n\n| title9 = 100 Joints\n| writer9 = {{hlist|Epps|Bobby Turner}}\n| extra9 = Bobby Kritical\n| length9 = 3:39\n\n| title10 = Rolls Royce Weather Everyday\n| note10 = featuring Lil Wayne\n| writer10 = {{hlist|Epps|Carter, Jr.|[[Lil' C (record producer)|Darwin Quinn]]|Ashanti Floyd|[[Dolla Boy|Earl Conyers]]|Gabriel Arillo}}\n| extra10 = {{hlist|[[Lil' C (record producer)|Lil' C]]|The Mad Violinist{{ref|a|[a]}}}}\n| length10 = 3:07\n\n| title11 = What Happened\n| note11 = featuring Lil Wayne\n| writer11 = {{hlist|Epps|Carter, Jr.|Benjamin Diehl|[[DJ Khaled|Khaled Khaled]]|Angus McDonald}}\n| extra11 = {{hlist|Ben Billions}}\n| length11 = 4:58\n\n| title12 = Section\n| note12 = featuring Lil Wayne\n| writer12 = {{hlist|Epps|Carter, Jr.|[[London on da Track|London Holmes]]}}\n| extra12 = [[London on da Track]]\n| length12 = 3:55\n| total_length = 47:32\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = yes\n| headline        = [[iTunes]] deluxe edition bonus track\n| extra_column    = Producer(s)\n| title13 = [[Watch Out (2 Chainz song)|Watch Out]]\n| writer13 = {{hlist|Epps|[[FKi (production team)|Trocon Roberts]]}}\n| extra13 = [[FKi (production team)|FKi]]\n| length13 = 3:27\n| total_length = 50:59\n}}\n\n'''Notes'''\n*<sup>{{note|a|[a]}}</sup> signifies an additional [[record producer|producer]]\n* \"MFN Right\" and \"Not Invited\" were initially included on 2 Chainz' mixtape ''Felt Like Cappin''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://genius.com/albums/2-chainz/Felt-like-cappin|title=Felt Like Cappin by 2 Chainz|website=Genius|access-date=2016-03-06}}</ref>\n* \"Watch Out\" was initially included on 2 Chainz' mixtape ''Trapavelli Tre''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://genius.com/albums/2-chainz/Trapavelli-tre|title=Trapavelli Tre by 2 Chainz|website=Genius|access-date=2016-03-06}}</ref>\n\n'''Sample credits'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2chainz.com/collegrove-credits/|title=Collegrove credits -

First, when the NCAA placed severe restrictions on the fielding of Division I teams by Division II institutions in 2011, it grandfathered in all then-current D-I teams at D-II schools. Apart from this, Division II members are allowed to compete for Division I championships in sports in which a Division II national championship is not contested.\n\nIn some sports, the NCAA only sponsors championships open to all member schools regardless of division, with examples including beach volleyball, fencing, rifle, and water polo. In men's and women's ice hockey and men's volleyball, the NCAA holds Division III championships, but does not hold a separate D-II championship. The NCAA officially classifies all championship events that are open to schools from more than one division as \"National Collegiate\", except in men's ice hockey, in which the top-level championship is styled as a Division I championship (presumably due to the past existence of a Division II championship in that sport). Division II members are allowed to compete for National Collegiate championships as well as the Division I men's ice hockey championship; in all such sports, they are allowed to operate under the same rules and scholarship restrictions that apply to full Division I members in that sport.\n\nThe Northeast-10 sponsors men's ice hockey for its members who choose to remain in D-II, including a postseason tournament. The conference formerly sponsored a women's ice hockey postseason tournament for those teams remaining in D-II but competing as independents during the regular season, but that tournament has been superseded by the [[New England Women's Hockey Alliance]] (NEWHA), which began play in 2017 as a scheduling agreement between all of the existing women's National Collegiate independents (including full D-I member Sacred Heart), organized as a full conference in 2018, and received official NCAA recognition in 2019. Because the NE-10 is the sole Division II hockey league, its postseason champion cannot compete for the NCAA national hockey championship. The Post University men's team competes as D-II and has a scheduling alliance with the NE-10 schools, while its women's team is a member of the NEWHA.\n\n*Future conference affiliations indicated in this list will take effect on July 1 of the stated year. In the case of spring sports, the first year of competition will take place in the calendar year after the conference move becomes official.\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n! School\n!

First, when the NCAA placed severe restrictions on the fielding of Division I teams by Division II institutions in 2011, it grandfathered in all then-current D-I teams at D-II schools. Apart from this, Division II members are allowed to compete for Division I championships in sports in which a Division II national championship is not contested.\n\nIn some sports, the NCAA only sponsors championships open to all member schools regardless of division, with examples including beach volleyball, fencing, rifle, and water polo. In men's and women's ice hockey and men's volleyball, the NCAA holds Division III championships, but does not hold a separate D-II championship. The NCAA officially classifies all championship events that are open to schools from more than one division as \"National Collegiate\", except in men's ice hockey, in which the top-level championship is styled as a Division I championship (presumably due to the past existence of a Division II championship in that sport). Division II members are allowed to compete for National Collegiate championships as well as the Division I men's ice hockey championship; in all such sports, they are allowed to operate under the same rules and scholarship restrictions that apply to full Division I members in that sport.\n\nThe Northeast-10 sponsors men's ice hockey for its members who choose to remain in D-II, including a postseason tournament. The conference formerly sponsored a women's ice hockey postseason tournament for those teams remaining in D-II but competing as independents during the regular season, but that tournament has been superseded by the [[New England Women's Hockey Alliance]] (NEWHA), which began play in 2017 as a scheduling agreement between all of the existing women's National Collegiate independents (including full D-I member Sacred Heart), organized as a full conference in 2018, and received official NCAA recognition in 2019. Because the NE-10 is the sole Division II hockey league, its postseason champion cannot compete for the NCAA national hockey championship. The Post University men's team competes as D-II and has a scheduling alliance with the NE-10 schools, while its women's team is a member of the NEWHA.\n\n*Future conference affiliations indicated in this list will take effect on July 1 of the stated year. In the case of spring sports, the first year of competition will take place in the calendar year after the conference move becomes official.\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n! School\n!

One of these is the Ndumberi Coffee Cooperative, which was inaugurated by Kenya's first president [[Jomo Kenyatta]] when it was formed in 1960.<ref>http://www.sweetmarias.com/coffee.africa.kenya.php\n</ref> Mars Drinks purchases its beans from this co-operative to produce Kenyan Dawn, a self-billed \"sustainable coffee choice.\" It has wet mills in Ndumberi, Riabai and Ngaita. In 2006, the company launched their sustainable coffee chain and started the Ndumberi Coffee Improvement Project.<ref>http://www.brightertomorrow.info/Ndumberi-Initiative-Homepage.htm</ref> In addition to improving farming conditions with new equipment and facilities, Mars Drinks helped the co-op become UTZ Certified.<ref>http://www.utzcertified.org/index.php?pageID=141&subID=9037</ref> This worldwide certification program sets a standard for responsible coffee production and sourcing.\n\n== PEFA Mercy Medical Centre==\nIn August 2007, PEFA Mercy Medical Centre opened in Ndumberi as another regional clinic. Operated by PEFA (Pentecostal Evangelical Fellowships of Africa) Mercy Ministries as an outreach of the Kiambu Central PEFA Brethren, the clinic was supplied by donations from Boise Idaho through the work of Genesis World Mission, Hands of Hope Northwest, Eagle (Idaho) Nazarene Church, Capital Christian Center, and Compassion International - Australia. The partnership between PEFA and some of these organizations extends back to 2003 when annual medical camps were held in Ndumberi, as well as 48&nbsp;km northwest of Ndumberi in Kirasha (Kamae). A nearby forest camp in the Kieni forest is home to over 4000 internally displaced people who are poverty stricken. Their plight is exacerbated by the government's forcible removal from the forest and relocation to a {{convert|3|acre|m2|adj=on}} plot. Expansion International, formed in [[Meridan Idaho]], started in 2008 with intentions to develop projects in Ndumberi and other places in Kenya.<ref>http://expansioninternational.org/index.php/projects/</ref>\n\n== Ndumberi Golf Club ==\nThe Ndumberi Golf Club and Sports Ground, popularly known as St. Andrews,<ref>http://www.marsgroupkenya.org/multimedia/?print&storydate=2005-04-23&StoryID=104056</ref> has the distinction of being a football field, as well as a golf course, and was formed in 1963.<ref>http://www.kgu.or.ke/courses/ndumberi.html</ref> It has produced several well-known Kenyan golfers. It is located along Kiambu road, but not in Ndumberi itself per se. In 2008, residents complained that the Kiambu Municipal Government destroyed part of the Sports Ground as part of improvements going on in the area.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n== Notes ==\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.genesisworldmission.org Genesis World Mission], a partner with the PEFA Mercy Ministry since 2006\n* [http://www.handsofhopeorg.com/ Hands Of Hope], the organization which shipped a container to support the PEFA Mercy Medical Center\n* [http://expansioninternational.org Expansion International]\n*\n[https://www.google.com/search?q=happy+feeds+ndumberi&oq=happy+feeds+ndumberi+&aqs=chrome..69i57.8567j0j7&client=ms-android-huawei-rev1&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8#trex=m_t:lcl_akp,rc_f:nav,rc_ludocids:15140010989384549464,rc_q:Happy%2520Feeds,ru_q:Happy%2520Feeds] \n*\n[https://www.google.com/search?q=l8+lounge&oq=l8&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l3.3104j0j7&client=ms-android-huawei-rev1&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8#trex=m_t:lcl_akp,rc_f:nav,rc_ludocids:10788313342566140770,rc_q:L8%2520Lounge%2520%2526%2520Grill,ru_q:L8%2520Lounge%2520%2526%2520Grill] \n*\n[[Category:Kiambu County]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Central Province (Kenya)]]\n", "name_user": "Neils51", "label": "safe", "comment": "spelling - it's->its", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ndumberi"}
