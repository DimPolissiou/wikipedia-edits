Bellisario, served for four years in the [[U.S. Marine Corps]], and after having worked his way up through advertising jobs, he landed his first network television job as a story editor for the World War II-era series ''[[Baa Baa Black Sheep (TV series)|Baa Baa Black Sheep]]'', where he got a habit of promoting a consistent promilitary stance in a business where he got the perception that \"antiwar\" and \"antisoldier\" mentality were the commonplace.<ref name=\"Erickson:127\">[[#Erickson|Erickson]]: p. 127.</ref> The stereotype in the post-[[Vietnam war]] era of \"[[Vietnam Veteran#Negative stereotypes of Vietnam veterans and efforts to overcome|crazed Vietnam veterans]]\" was notably subverted, by not just one, but three of the main characters, in ''[[Magnum P.I.]]'', of which Bellisario was the co-creator.<ref name=\"Erickson:127\"/> \nFollowing the cancellation of his series ''[[Quantum Leap]]'', Bellisario began working on a one-shot screenplay of a murder mystery aboard a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier, where the victim was a female aviator.<ref name=\"Erickson:127\"/>\n\nThe issue of whether or not to expand the options for women serving in the U.S. armed forces as fighter pilots and in other frontline assignments was a contentious social issue of the day. In 1991, a famous incident had occurred at the [[Tailhook Association]] [[Tailhook scandal|convention in Las Vegas]], where male naval aviators had behaved in manners inappropriate, if not criminal.  The follow-up criminal and other investigations by the [[Naval Investigative Service|then-named NIS]], the [[Naval Inspector General]], and the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, were later heavily criticized by the [[Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Defense]].  The  [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Acting Secretary of the Navy]] [[Sean O'Keefe]], to whom the report was delivered, agreed with the findings and began to take corrective action with respect to both the perceived attitude problems towards women and the functions of the investigative arms of the Department of the Navy.<ref>{{cite AV media | date = 1992-09-24 | title = Defense Department News Briefing | url = http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/DefenseDepartmentNewsBriefing71 | accessdate = 2013-09-19 | format = Television production | publisher = [[C-SPAN]] | ref = WIC | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130920193630/http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/DefenseDepartmentNewsBriefing71 | archivedate = September 20, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\nThe fallout from the incident resulted in a hard blow to the [[Naval aviation|naval aviation community]], where the promotions of many [[naval aviator]]s were put on hold. The common counterclaim from the other side of the aisle, as articulated by former Secretary of the Navy in the [[Reagan administration]] and [[naval flight officer]] [[John F. Lehman]], was that the naval aviation community had been unfairly subjected to a witch-hunt motivated by [[political correctness]], in effect killing its ''esprit de corps'', and by extension damaging its combat effectiveness.<ref name=\"Lehman:372\">[[#Lehman|Lehman]]: p. 372.</ref> During the [[Clinton administration]] in April 1993, [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Les Aspin]] announced a new policy, which in effect made it possible to have female fighter pilots serving on aircraft carriers at sea and in other new positions (but still prohibited from serving in [[infantry]], etc.)\n<ref>{{cite AV media | date = 1993-04-28 | title = Women in Combat (Department of Defense briefing) | url = http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/WomeninComb | accessdate = 2013-09-19 | format = Television production | publisher = [[C-SPAN]] | ref = WIC | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130920193631/http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/WomeninComb | archivedate = September 20, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\nThus, the stage was set for the reality-based fictional drama, when Bellisario read in a newspaper about the forthcoming introduction of female fighter pilots on aircraft carriers.<ref name=\"Erickson:127\"/>\n\nWhile doing research on which organizational entities would partake in investigative efforts of crimes committed aboard Naval vessels, Bellisario found  the special agents of the [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]] filled the police role, and the uniformed lawyers, in the Navy's Judge Advocate General's Corps, could alternate between the role of defense attorney, prosecutor, and field investigator. Bellisario chose to go ahead with the lawyers and remarked season six about the unique advantages it brought from a story-telling point of view: \"Unlike most [[legal drama|law shows]], I've got a detective, a prosecutor, and a defender.\"<ref name=\"Erickson:127\"/>\n\n===Collaboration with the military===\n[[File:RADM Donald Guter, JAGC, USN visited the JAG television series set, 2001-02-20.jpg|thumb|The then-[[Judge Advocate General of the Navy]], Rear Admiral Donald J. Guter (second from left), visiting the set, meeting with the cast during the shooting of \"[[JAG (season 6)#ep128|Liberty]]\" in 2001]]\n\nInitially, the producers of ''JAG'' did not receive any co-operation from the Department of the Navy, due to sensitivity in light of all the accumulative negative publicity that had been generated from the [[Tailhook scandal]] and its aftermath.<ref name=\"Erickson:129\">[[#Erickson|Erickson]]: p. 129.</ref> However, the lack of co-operation from the military was not a show-stopper, as the ''JAG'' production team, by virtue of being a [[Paramount Pictures]] production, had access to the [[stock footage]] of the motion pictures owned by the studio, which included many films with military content, such as ''[[Top Gun (film)|Top Gun]]'', ''[[The Final Countdown (film)|The Final Countdown]]'', and ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]].<ref name=\"Erickson:128\">[[#Erickson|Erickson]]: p. 128.</ref>\n\nIn 1997, though, the naval services had begun to change their minds, and began to render support to the production team on a script-by-script basis. A primetime network series about Navy lawyers bringing out controversial subjects in a very public arena was apparently no longer an issue in itself, but as noted by Commander Bob Anderson of the Navy's [[Public affairs (military)|entertainment media liaison office]] in Los Angeles in a ''[[TV Guide]]'' interview: \"We're fine with that as long as the bad guys are caught and punished, and the institution of the Navy is not the bad guy\".<ref name=\"Erickson:129\"/>\n\n===Ships===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\nAlmost all episodes of the series feature scenes filmed aboard real United States Navy ships. The ship most widely used was {{USS|Forrestal|CV-59|6}}, in commission as a training carrier at the time. Most of the ''Nimitz''-class carriers also appear in one or several episodes. {{USS|Saratoga|CV-60|6}}, {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}, and {{USS|John F. Kennedy|CV-67|6}} were also used in the series.\n\nUSS ''Enterprise'' was used as the fictional USS ''Seahawk'' in many episodes. USS ''Forrestal'' and {{USS|Dwight D. Eisenhower|CVN-69|6}} were also used as the fictional ''Seahawk'', both in season four and for one episode each. For scenes filmed aboard ''Enterprise'', the whole crew wore caps reading ''USS Seahawk \u2013 CVN 65'' so they matched the ship's real hull number.\n\nUSS ''Forrestal'' was featured in many episodes, most prominently two in which she portrayed the fictional USS ''Reprisal''.  In these episodes, all crew members wore caps with the ''CV-35'' pennant number.  This number was intentionally out of sequence with the pennant numbers of active USN carriers at the time the series was filmed. CV-35 would have been the real pennant number of an ''Essex''-class carrier actually called ''Reprisal'', which was canceled during construction in 1945 when World War II ended, and broken up in 1949 after consideration had been given to completing her to a revised design roughly similar to that of {{USS|Oriskany|CV-34|6}}.\n\nOnly six USN ships featured in the series were called by their real names: {{USS|Hornet|CV-12|6}}, {{USS|Coral Sea|CV-43|6}}, {{USS|Kitty Hawk|CV-63|6}}, {{USS|America|CV-66|6}}, {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|6}}, and {{USS|Belknap|CG-26|6}}. ''Kitty Hawk'' is mentioned in one of the season-three episodes, but never seen on screen. ''America'' is the murder scene in a season-three episode, but shots supposedly depicting her are in fact shots of ''Forrestal''. Real shots of ''Theodore Roosevelt'' in harbor are used in one episode of season one.\n\n[[File:US Navy 050125-N-0685S-001 Crewmembers for the hit television show JAG set up for the next shot outside the Transient Aircraft Line on board Naval Air Station North Island, Calif.jpg|thumb|upright|Crewmembers set up for a shot at [[Naval Air Station North Island|NAS North Island]] (2005)]]\n\nSeason-three opener \"Ghost Ship\" was filmed entirely aboard ''Hornet'' while she was laid up at Alameda Naval Air Station before being preserved as a museum ship. Part of the storyline in \"Ghost Ship\" deals with the final fate of ''Hornet''. It implies (though not explicitly stating it) she was eventually scrapped due to severe fire damage sustained during the course of the episode, contrary to her real-life fate as a national landmark. The subplot in \"Ghost Ship\" indicating that the ship's double hull had to be cut open from the inside to repair supposed damage to her bow during Vietnam was not at all correct with her service record.\n\n''Coral Sea'' is also featured in the season-three episode \"Vanished\" and season-four episodes \"Angels 30\" and \"Shakedown\". As she had already been scrapped at the time the episodes supposedly took place, archival footage of ''Coral Sea'' was used, with other footage shot aboard ''Forrestal''. The majority of the exterior scenes from \"Angels 30\" were filmed aboard ''Forrestal'' and a few aboard ''Enterprise''.\n\n''Belknap'' is mentioned in the season-four episode \"Going after Francesca\" as the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] flagship, a role she actually fulfilled in real life from 1986 until her decommissioning in 1994. ''Belknap'' had already been decommissioned and was laid up awaiting scrapping when the episode was filmed, allowing for actual exterior shots of the ship to be featured in the episode.\n\nThe series also includes appearances by {{sclass-|Tarawa|amphibious assault ship|1}}s, {{sclass-|Ticonderoga|cruiser|1}}s, {{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer|1}}s (in particular {{USS|Arleigh Burke|DDG-51|6}} itself during the opening credit montage), and {{sclass-|Oliver Hazard Perry|frigate|1}}s. In one of the episodes, the [[Spanish Navy|Spanish]] frigate {{ship|Spanish frigate|Santa Mar\u00eda||2}} is used to depict a fictional USN ''Oliver Hazard Perry''-class ship (denoted by her NATO pennant number \"F 81\" painted under the bridge, instead of the U.S. practice of having a \"number only\" ID painted on the bow).\n\nWhile most sea episodes are focused on aviation missions, several are based around submarine warfare: namely episodes 1:3, 2:6, 4:16, 5:22, 6:15, 7:14, 7:24, 8:7, 8:17, and 9:7.\n\n===Series end===\n[[File:JAGcoin.png|thumb|right|Harm (David James Elliott) and Mac (Catherine Bell) use a challenge coin to determine who will resign his or her commission.]]\nIn February 2005, David James Elliott announced he would leave the show at the end of the 10th season; the show was subsequently not renewed for an 11th season by the network.<ref name=\"Why JAG\">{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=Maureen|title=Why 'JAG' came to an abrupt end|url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2005/04/why_jag_came_to.html|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=October 11, 2013|date=April 29, 2005|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012052549/http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2005/04/why_jag_came_to.html|archivedate=October 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The show also introduced new younger characters, including former ''[[As the World Turns]]'' star [[Chris Beetem]], and [[Jordana Spiro]] from ''[[The Huntress (TV series)|The Huntress]]''.\n\nThe producers also considered relocating the fictional setting of the show, from Falls Church to [[Naval Base San Diego]]. An episode of the final season, \"[[List of JAG episodes#ep222|JAG: San Diego]]\" had the main cast, excluding Harm, going to the San Diego naval base and working with the local JAG office there. Though it was reportedly considered as a pilot episode, as a reformat of the show aiming for a younger audience, CBS ultimately decided not to pursue a new series.\n\nNevertheless, CBS announced the cancellation of the show on April 4, 2005, after 10 seasons. The final episode, \"[[List of JAG episodes#ep227|Fair Winds and Following Seas]]\", aired on April 29, 2005, and in which Harm and Mac are assigned different [[Military base|stations]]: Harm in [[London]], Mac in [[San Diego]]. They finally confront their feelings and decide to get married. The episode ends with Bud tossing a [[challenge coin]] to decide which one would give up his or her military career to be with the other. However, in keeping with ''JAG'' tradition, the outcome of the toss is never seen, as the screen fades to black, showing only the coin, which bears the inscription \"1995 \u2013 2005\", the years the series spanned.\n\nWhat happened is later revealed in the 2019 finale of the [[NCIS: Los Angeles (season 10)|tenth season]] of ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]'', ''\"False Flag\"'', in which David James Elliott and Catherine Bell both appeared. Mac won the coin toss and Harm resigned his commission and moved with her to San Diego, but later they mutually ended their relationship and Harm rejoined the Navy and is currently serving as the [[Executive officer|XO]] of the (fictional) aircraft carrier, ''USS Allegiance''. Mac left the Marines to serve as Marine Liaison to the Secretary of State, a civilian position. Harm and Mac had not seen each other in 9 years until video conferencing with each other in their new roles. In the [[NCIS: Los Angeles (season 11)|eleventh season]] premiere, Harm and Mac reunite in person, share an embrace, and later renew a discussion of their relationship, once again without reaching a conclusion.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Nielsen ratings===\nSeasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of ''JAG'' on NBC (first season) and CBS (other seasons).\n: Note: U.S. network television seasons generally start in late September and end in late May, which coincides with the completion of the May [[sweeps]].\n\n{| style=\"text-align:center;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Bellisario was developing a ''JAG'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]],  around the work of the [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]].<ref name=\"Variety20030113\">{{cite web|title=CBS \u2018Angel\u2019 to fly home \u2013 Net also eyes 'JAG' spinoff|url=https://variety.com/2003/scene/news/cbs-angel-to-fly-home-1117878658/|work=TV Line|accessdate=October 11, 2013|date=January 13, 2003|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012033839/http://variety.com/2003/scene/news/cbs-angel-to-fly-home-1117878658/|archivedate=October 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It was aired in April 2003 in a two-part [[backdoor pilot]] in which Commander Rabb is arrested, but later vindicated as innocent, for the murder of Lieutenant Singer. The two episodes, titled \"[[Ice Queen (JAG)|Ice Queen]]\" and \"[[Meltdown (JAG)|Meltdown]]\", focused on the NCIS team, with most of the JAG regulars as supporting characters. Whereas the episodes of ''JAG'' are primarily oriented on a mixture of courtroom drama and military activities in the field, ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' episodes are more focused, as the meaning of  the acronym suggests, on criminal investigations. ''NCIS'' also follows a different storytelling format from ''JAG'', emphasizing character humor to a larger extent than its parent program. ''NCIS'' later produced its own spin-offs, ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]'' and ''[[NCIS: New Orleans]]'', which shows a further departure from the styles and themes of ''JAG''.\n\nThe two episodes \"Ice Queen\" and \"Meltdown\" were edited down to a one-hour pilot film, which was then used to sell the idea of ''NCIS'' as a new series to CBS; the pilot used the title, \"NCIS \u2013 The Beginning\". It was later also used to introduce the show to CBS affiliates and advertisers.  It was only broadcast once and is not available on home video.\n\nExcluding the backdoor pilot, few major characters from ''JAG'' have appeared in the ''NCIS'' series. Patrick Labyorteaux appeared briefly as Lieutenant Bud Roberts in the ''NCIS'' first-season episode \"[[NCIS (season 1)#ep2|Hung Out to Dry]]\", and again \u2013 now with the rank of captain \u2013 in the season fourteen episode \"Rogue,\" advising the NCIS team on a legal issue. [[John M. Jackson]] returned in May 2013 as retired Rear Admiral A.J. Chegwidden, now a civilian attorney in the private sector hired by [[List of NCIS characters#Leon Vance|Director Vance]] to provide legal representation for [[Leroy Jethro Gibbs|Special Agent Gibbs]], in the season ten ''NCIS'' finale, \"[[Damned If You Do (NCIS)|Damned If You Do]]\".<ref name=tl>{{cite web|last=Roots|first=Kimberly|title=NCIS Exclusive: A JAG Favorite to Return in This Season's 'Nail-Biter' of a Finale|url=http://tvline.com/2013/04/12/ncis-season-10-cast-john-m-jackson-jag-chegwidden/|work=TV Line|accessdate=October 11, 2013|date=April 12, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012043344/http://tvline.com/2013/04/12/ncis-season-10-cast-john-m-jackson-jag-chegwidden/|archivedate=October 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Jackson has recurred as A.J. Chegwidden since the eighth season of ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]''. Chegwidden is a Vietnam-era compatriot of series regulars Hetty Lange ([[Linda Hunt]]) and Owen Granger ([[Miguel Ferrer]]). David James Elliot and Catherine Bell returned to their roles as Harmon Rabb and Sarah MacKenzie for the first time since ''JAG'' ended in the last two episodes of [[NCIS: Los Angeles (season 10)|the tenth season of ''NCIS: Los Angeles'']].<ref>\"[[NCIS: Los Angeles (season 10)#ep23|The Guardian]]\" and \"[[NCIS: Los Angeles (season 10)#ep24|False Flag]]\".</ref>\n\nWhile several other actors who played major roles on ''JAG'' have also appeared on ''NCIS'', such as Scott Lawrence (Sturgis Turner on ''JAG''),<ref>Scott Lawrence played Captain Thomas Lind in the ''NCIS'' episode \"[[A Man Walks Into a Bar...]]\".</ref> Steven Culp (Clayton Webb on ''JAG''),<ref>Steven Culp played Commander William Skinner in the ''NCIS'' fifth-season episode \"[[NCIS (season 5)#ep100|Chimera]]\".</ref> Randy Vazquez (Victor Galindez on ''JAG''),<ref>Randy Vazquez played ATF Special Agent Phillip Caffey in the ''NCIS'' twelfth-season episode \"[[NCIS (season 12)#ep278|No Good Deed]]\".</ref> and [[Michael Bellisario]] ([[Mikey Roberts]] on ''JAG'');<ref>Recurring part as [[List of NCIS characters#Charles .22Chip.22 Sterling|Chip Sterling]] in four episodes (\"[[NCIS (season 3)#ep52|The Voyeur's Web]]\", \"[[NCIS (season 3)#ep53|Honor Code]]\", \"[[NCIS (season 3)#ep54|Under Covers]]\", and \"[[NCIS (season 3)#ep55|Frame Up]]\") of the third season of ''NCIS''.</ref> they played completely different characters when appearing on ''NCIS''. Similarly, after [[Sean Murray (actor)|Sean Murray]] (Donald Bellisario's stepson) played a one-off Ensign character in ''JAG'' season 4, and the recurring character of Danny Walden in season 6, he joined the core cast of ''NCIS'' during the first season as Tim McGee, and is still on the show as of 2019.\n\nFirst introduced in the NCIS back-door pilot, [[Alicia Coppola]] appeared as Navy judge advocate Lieutenant Commander Faith Coleman in several episodes of ''NCIS''.<ref>''NCIS'' episodes: \"[[NCIS (season 1)#ep18|UnSEALeD]]\", \"[[NCIS (season 2)#7|Call of Silence]]\" and \"[[NCIS (season 2)#ep44|Hometown Hero]]\".</ref> [[Adam Baldwin]] played the same guest role, Navy SEAL Commander Michael Rainer, in one episode of each show.<ref>''JAG'': \"[[List of JAG episodes#ep195|Good Intentions]]\"'' NCIS'': \"[[NCIS (season 1)#ep22|A Weak Link]]\" (first season).</ref>\n\n===''First Monday'' cross-over===\n''[[First Monday]]'' was a short-lived series co-created by Bellisario and [[Paul Levine]] about fictional [[U.S. Supreme Court]] justices and their clerks, which aired in 2002 and starred [[James Garner]] and [[Joe Mantegna]]. The character of [[U.S. Senator]] Edward Sheffield ([[Dean Stockwell]]), who appeared in three episodes of that show, later became a recurring character on ''JAG'' as the new [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]], starting in season eight.\n\n===''Yes, Dear'' tribute===\nThe sitcom ''[[Yes, Dear]]'' did an episode called \"Let's Get Jaggy With It\" where Greg's father Tom ([[Tim Conway]]) wins a walk-on role on ''JAG''. Catherine Bell guest-starred as herself while David James Elliott, Patrick Labyorteaux, and Scott Lawrence guest-starred as their respective ''JAG'' characters.\n\n==Home media==\nOn September 1, 1998, the pilot episode of ''JAG'' was released on [[VHS]] cassette in the U.S. by [[Paramount Home Entertainment]]. However, no further episodes of the series proper were released on any home entertainment media while the show was still in production, allegedly due to syndication deals made with several broadcasters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortunecity.com/lavendar/pulpfiction/99/jag.faq.txt |title=JAG faq |accessdate=2013-09-17 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305193454/http://www.fortunecity.com/lavendar/pulpfiction/99/jag.faq.txt |archivedate=March 5, 2012 }}, Retrieved on 2013-09-17.</ref>\n\nBeginning in 2006, [[CBS Home Entertainment]] (distributed by [[Paramount Home Entertainment|Paramount]]) has released all 10 seasons on DVD in regions 1, 2 and 4.<ref>[http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/shows/JAG/2445#News JAG] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217115007/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/shows/JAG/2445 |date=February 17, 2013 }}, [[TVShowsOnDVD.com]]. retrieved on 2013-09-17.</ref> Seasons 1 to 4 are released with a 4:3 [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], while seasons 5 to 10 have a 16:9 aspect ratio.

Bellisario, served for four years in the [[U.S. Marine Corps]], and after having worked his way up through advertising jobs, he landed his first network television job as a story editor for the World War II-era series ''[[Baa Baa Black Sheep (TV series)|Baa Baa Black Sheep]]'', where he got a habit of promoting a consistent promilitary stance in a business where he got the perception that \"antiwar\" and \"antisoldier\" mentality were the commonplace.<ref name=\"Erickson:127\">[[#Erickson|Erickson]]: p. 127.</ref> The stereotype in the post-[[Vietnam war]] era of \"[[Vietnam Veteran#Negative stereotypes of Vietnam veterans and efforts to overcome|crazed Vietnam veterans]]\" was notably subverted, by not just one, but three of the main characters, in ''[[Magnum P.I.]]'', of which Bellisario was the co-creator.<ref name=\"Erickson:127\"/> \nFollowing the cancellation of his series ''[[Quantum Leap]]'', Bellisario began working on a one-shot screenplay of a murder mystery aboard a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier, where the victim was a female aviator.<ref name=\"Erickson:127\"/>\n\nThe issue of whether or not to expand the options for women serving in the U.S. armed forces as fighter pilots and in other frontline assignments was a contentious social issue of the day. In 1991, a famous incident had occurred at the [[Tailhook Association]] [[Tailhook scandal|convention in Las Vegas]], where male naval aviators had behaved in manners inappropriate, if not criminal.  The follow-up criminal and other investigations by the [[Naval Investigative Service|then-named NIS]], the [[Naval Inspector General]], and the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, were later heavily criticized by the [[Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Defense]].  The  [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Acting Secretary of the Navy]] [[Sean O'Keefe]], to whom the report was delivered, agreed with the findings and began to take corrective action with respect to both the perceived attitude problems towards women and the functions of the investigative arms of the Department of the Navy.<ref>{{cite AV media | date = 1992-09-24 | title = Defense Department News Briefing | url = http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/DefenseDepartmentNewsBriefing71 | accessdate = 2013-09-19 | format = Television production | publisher = [[C-SPAN]] | ref = WIC | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130920193630/http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/DefenseDepartmentNewsBriefing71 | archivedate = September 20, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\nThe fallout from the incident resulted in a hard blow to the [[Naval aviation|naval aviation community]], where the promotions of many [[naval aviator]]s were put on hold. The common counterclaim from the other side of the aisle, as articulated by former Secretary of the Navy in the [[Reagan administration]] and [[naval flight officer]] [[John F. Lehman]], was that the naval aviation community had been unfairly subjected to a witch-hunt motivated by [[political correctness]], in effect killing its ''esprit de corps'', and by extension damaging its combat effectiveness.<ref name=\"Lehman:372\">[[#Lehman|Lehman]]: p. 372.</ref> During the [[Clinton administration]] in April 1993, [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Les Aspin]] announced a new policy, which in effect made it possible to have female fighter pilots serving on aircraft carriers at sea and in other new positions (but still prohibited from serving in [[infantry]], etc.)\n<ref>{{cite AV media | date = 1993-04-28 | title = Women in Combat (Department of Defense briefing) | url = http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/WomeninComb | accessdate = 2013-09-19 | format = Television production | publisher = [[C-SPAN]] | ref = WIC | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130920193631/http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/WomeninComb | archivedate = September 20, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\nThus, the stage was set for the reality-based fictional drama, when Bellisario read in a newspaper about the forthcoming introduction of female fighter pilots on aircraft carriers.<ref name=\"Erickson:127\"/>\n\nWhile doing research on which organizational entities would partake in investigative efforts of crimes committed aboard Naval vessels, Bellisario found  the special agents of the [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]] filled the police role, and the uniformed lawyers, in the Navy's Judge Advocate General's Corps, could alternate between the role of defense attorney, prosecutor, and field investigator. Bellisario chose to go ahead with the lawyers and remarked season six about the unique advantages it brought from a story-telling point of view: \"Unlike most [[legal drama|law shows]], I've got a detective, a prosecutor, and a defender.\"<ref name=\"Erickson:127\"/>\n\n===Collaboration with the military===\n[[File:RADM Donald Guter, JAGC, USN visited the JAG television series set, 2001-02-20.jpg|thumb|The then-[[Judge Advocate General of the Navy]], Rear Admiral Donald J. Guter (second from left), visiting the set, meeting with the cast during the shooting of \"[[JAG (season 6)#ep128|Liberty]]\" in 2001]]\n\nInitially, the producers of ''JAG'' did not receive any co-operation from the Department of the Navy, due to sensitivity in light of all the accumulative negative publicity that had been generated from the [[Tailhook scandal]] and its aftermath.<ref name=\"Erickson:129\">[[#Erickson|Erickson]]: p. 129.</ref> However, the lack of co-operation from the military was not a show-stopper, as the ''JAG'' production team, by virtue of being a [[Paramount Pictures]] production, had access to the [[stock footage]] of the motion pictures owned by the studio, which included many films with military content, such as ''[[Top Gun (film)|Top Gun]]'', ''[[The Final Countdown (film)|The Final Countdown]]'', and ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]].<ref name=\"Erickson:128\">[[#Erickson|Erickson]]: p. 128.</ref>\n\nIn 1997, though, the naval services had begun to change their minds, and began to render support to the production team on a script-by-script basis. A primetime network series about Navy lawyers bringing out controversial subjects in a very public arena was apparently no longer an issue in itself, but as noted by Commander Bob Anderson of the Navy's [[Public affairs (military)|entertainment media liaison office]] in Los Angeles in a ''[[TV Guide]]'' interview: \"We're fine with that as long as the bad guys are caught and punished, and the institution of the Navy is not the bad guy\".<ref name=\"Erickson:129\"/>\n\n===Ships===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\nAlmost all episodes of the series feature scenes filmed aboard real United States Navy ships. The ship most widely used was {{USS|Forrestal|CV-59|6}}, in commission as a training carrier at the time. Most of the ''Nimitz''-class carriers also appear in one or several episodes. {{USS|Saratoga|CV-60|6}}, {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}, and {{USS|John F. Kennedy|CV-67|6}} were also used in the series.\n\nUSS ''Enterprise'' was used as the fictional USS ''Seahawk'' in many episodes. USS ''Forrestal'' and {{USS|Dwight D. Eisenhower|CVN-69|6}} were also used as the fictional ''Seahawk'', both in season four and for one episode each. For scenes filmed aboard ''Enterprise'', the whole crew wore caps reading ''USS Seahawk \u2013 CVN 65'' so they matched the ship's real hull number.\n\nUSS ''Forrestal'' was featured in many episodes, most prominently two in which she portrayed the fictional USS ''Reprisal''.  In these episodes, all crew members wore caps with the ''CV-35'' pennant number.  This number was intentionally out of sequence with the pennant numbers of active USN carriers at the time the series was filmed. CV-35 would have been the real pennant number of an ''Essex''-class carrier actually called ''Reprisal'', which was canceled during construction in 1945 when World War II ended, and broken up in 1949 after consideration had been given to completing her to a revised design roughly similar to that of {{USS|Oriskany|CV-34|6}}.\n\nOnly six USN ships featured in the series were called by their real names: {{USS|Hornet|CV-12|6}}, {{USS|Coral Sea|CV-43|6}}, {{USS|Kitty Hawk|CV-63|6}}, {{USS|America|CV-66|6}}, {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71|6}}, and {{USS|Belknap|CG-26|6}}. ''Kitty Hawk'' is mentioned in one of the season-three episodes, but never seen on screen. ''America'' is the murder scene in a season-three episode, but shots supposedly depicting her are in fact shots of ''Forrestal''. Real shots of ''Theodore Roosevelt'' in harbor are used in one episode of season one.\n\n[[File:US Navy 050125-N-0685S-001 Crewmembers for the hit television show JAG set up for the next shot outside the Transient Aircraft Line on board Naval Air Station North Island, Calif.jpg|thumb|upright|Crewmembers set up for a shot at [[Naval Air Station North Island|NAS North Island]] (2005)]]\n\nSeason-three opener \"Ghost Ship\" was filmed entirely aboard ''Hornet'' while she was laid up at Alameda Naval Air Station before being preserved as a museum ship. Part of the storyline in \"Ghost Ship\" deals with the final fate of ''Hornet''. It implies (though not explicitly stating it) she was eventually scrapped due to severe fire damage sustained during the course of the episode, contrary to her real-life fate as a national landmark. The subplot in \"Ghost Ship\" indicating that the ship's double hull had to be cut open from the inside to repair supposed damage to her bow during Vietnam was not at all correct with her service record.\n\n''Coral Sea'' is also featured in the season-three episode \"Vanished\" and season-four episodes \"Angels 30\" and \"Shakedown\". As she had already been scrapped at the time the episodes supposedly took place, archival footage of ''Coral Sea'' was used, with other footage shot aboard ''Forrestal''. The majority of the exterior scenes from \"Angels 30\" were filmed aboard ''Forrestal'' and a few aboard ''Enterprise''.\n\n''Belknap'' is mentioned in the season-four episode \"Going after Francesca\" as the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] flagship, a role she actually fulfilled in real life from 1986 until her decommissioning in 1994. ''Belknap'' had already been decommissioned and was laid up awaiting scrapping when the episode was filmed, allowing for actual exterior shots of the ship to be featured in the episode.\n\nThe series also includes appearances by {{sclass-|Tarawa|amphibious assault ship|1}}s, {{sclass-|Ticonderoga|cruiser|1}}s, {{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer|1}}s (in particular {{USS|Arleigh Burke|DDG-51|6}} itself during the opening credit montage), and {{sclass-|Oliver Hazard Perry|frigate|1}}s. In one of the episodes, the [[Spanish Navy|Spanish]] frigate {{ship|Spanish frigate|Santa Mar\u00eda||2}} is used to depict a fictional USN ''Oliver Hazard Perry''-class ship (denoted by her NATO pennant number \"F 81\" painted under the bridge, instead of the U.S. practice of having a \"number only\" ID painted on the bow).\n\nWhile most sea episodes are focused on aviation missions, several are based around submarine warfare: namely episodes 1:3, 2:6, 4:16, 5:22, 6:15, 7:14, 7:24, 8:7, 8:17, and 9:7.\n\n===Series end===\n[[File:JAGcoin.png|thumb|right|Harm (David James Elliott) and Mac (Catherine Bell) use a challenge coin to determine who will resign his or her commission.]]\nIn February 2005, David James Elliott announced he would leave the show at the end of the 10th season; the show was subsequently not renewed for an 11th season by the network.<ref name=\"Why JAG\">{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=Maureen|title=Why 'JAG' came to an abrupt end|url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2005/04/why_jag_came_to.html|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=October 11, 2013|date=April 29, 2005|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012052549/http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2005/04/why_jag_came_to.html|archivedate=October 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The show also introduced new younger characters, including former ''[[As the World Turns]]'' star [[Chris Beetem]], and [[Jordana Spiro]] from ''[[The Huntress (TV series)|The Huntress]]''.\n\nThe producers also considered relocating the fictional setting of the show, from Falls Church to [[Naval Base San Diego]]. An episode of the final season, \"[[List of JAG episodes#ep222|JAG: San Diego]]\" had the main cast, excluding Harm, going to the San Diego naval base and working with the local JAG office there. Though it was reportedly considered as a pilot episode, as a reformat of the show aiming for a younger audience, CBS ultimately decided not to pursue a new series.\n\nNevertheless, CBS announced the cancellation of the show on April 4, 2005, after 10 seasons. The final episode, \"[[List of JAG episodes#ep227|Fair Winds and Following Seas]]\", aired on April 29, 2005, and in which Harm and Mac are assigned different [[Military base|stations]]: Harm in [[London]], Mac in [[San Diego]]. They finally confront their feelings and decide to get married. The episode ends with Bud tossing a [[challenge coin]] to decide which one would give up his or her military career to be with the other. However, in keeping with ''JAG'' tradition, the outcome of the toss is never seen, as the screen fades to black, showing only the coin, which bears the inscription \"1995 \u2013 2005\", the years the series spanned.\n\nWhat happened is later revealed in the 2019 finale of the [[NCIS: Los Angeles (season 10)|tenth season]] of ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]'', ''\"False Flag\"'', in which David James Elliott and Catherine Bell both appeared. Mac won the coin toss and Harm resigned his commission and moved with her to San Diego, but later they mutually ended their relationship and Harm rejoined the Navy and is currently serving as the [[Executive officer|XO]] of the (fictional) aircraft carrier, ''USS Allegiance''. Mac left the Marines to serve as Marine Liaison to the Secretary of State, a civilian position. Harm and Mac had not seen each other in 9 years until video conferencing with each other in their new roles. In the [[NCIS: Los Angeles (season 11)|eleventh season]] premiere, Harm and Mac reunite in person, share an embrace, and later renew a discussion of their relationship, once again without reaching a conclusion.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Nielsen ratings===\nSeasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of ''JAG'' on NBC (first season) and CBS (other seasons).\n: Note: U.S. network television seasons generally start in late September and end in late May, which coincides with the completion of the May [[sweeps]].\n\n{| style=\"text-align:center;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Bellisario was developing a ''JAG'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]],  around the work of the [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]].<ref name=\"Variety20030113\">{{cite web|title=CBS \u2018Angel\u2019 to fly home \u2013 Net also eyes 'JAG' spinoff|url=https://variety.com/2003/scene/news/cbs-angel-to-fly-home-1117878658/|work=TV Line|accessdate=October 11, 2013|date=January 13, 2003|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012033839/http://variety.com/2003/scene/news/cbs-angel-to-fly-home-1117878658/|archivedate=October 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It was aired in April 2003 in a two-part [[backdoor pilot]] in which Commander Rabb is arrested, but later vindicated as innocent, for the murder of Lieutenant Singer. The two episodes, titled \"[[Ice Queen (JAG)|Ice Queen]]\" and \"[[Meltdown (JAG)|Meltdown]]\", focused on the NCIS team, with most of the JAG regulars as supporting characters. Whereas the episodes of ''JAG'' are primarily oriented on a mixture of courtroom drama and military activities in the field, ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' episodes are more focused, as the meaning of  the acronym suggests, on criminal investigations. ''NCIS'' also follows a different storytelling format from ''JAG'', emphasizing character humor to a larger extent than its parent program. ''NCIS'' later produced its own spin-offs, ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]'' and ''[[NCIS: New Orleans]]'', which shows a further departure from the styles and themes of ''JAG''.\n\nThe two episodes \"Ice Queen\" and \"Meltdown\" were edited down to a one-hour pilot film, which was then used to sell the idea of ''NCIS'' as a new series to CBS; the pilot used the title, \"NCIS \u2013 The Beginning\". It was later also used to introduce the show to CBS affiliates and advertisers.  It was only broadcast once and is not available on home video.\n\nExcluding the backdoor pilot, few major characters from ''JAG'' have appeared in the ''NCIS'' series. Patrick Labyorteaux appeared briefly as Lieutenant Bud Roberts in the ''NCIS'' first-season episode \"[[NCIS (season 1)#ep2|Hung Out to Dry]]\", and again \u2013 now with the rank of captain \u2013 in the season fourteen episode \"Rogue,\" advising the NCIS team on a legal issue. [[John M. Jackson]] returned in May 2013 as retired Rear Admiral A.J. Chegwidden, now a civilian attorney in the private sector hired by [[List of NCIS characters#Leon Vance|Director Vance]] to provide legal representation for [[Leroy Jethro Gibbs|Special Agent Gibbs]], in the season ten ''NCIS'' finale, \"[[Damned If You Do (NCIS)|Damned If You Do]]\".<ref name=tl>{{cite web|last=Roots|first=Kimberly|title=NCIS Exclusive: A JAG Favorite to Return in This Season's 'Nail-Biter' of a Finale|url=http://tvline.com/2013/04/12/ncis-season-10-cast-john-m-jackson-jag-chegwidden/|work=TV Line|accessdate=October 11, 2013|date=April 12, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012043344/http://tvline.com/2013/04/12/ncis-season-10-cast-john-m-jackson-jag-chegwidden/|archivedate=October 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Jackson has recurred as A.J. Chegwidden since the eighth season of ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]''. Chegwidden is a Vietnam-era compatriot of series regulars Hetty Lange ([[Linda Hunt]]) and Owen Granger ([[Miguel Ferrer]]). David James Elliot and Catherine Bell returned to their roles as Harmon Rabb and Sarah MacKenzie for the first time since ''JAG'' ended in the last two episodes of [[NCIS: Los Angeles (season 10)|the tenth season of ''NCIS: Los Angeles'']].<ref>\"[[NCIS: Los Angeles (season 10)#ep23|The Guardian]]\" and \"[[NCIS: Los Angeles (season 10)#ep24|False Flag]]\".</ref>\n\nWhile several other actors who played major roles on ''JAG'' have also appeared on ''NCIS'', such as Scott Lawrence (Sturgis Turner on ''JAG''),<ref>Scott Lawrence played Captain Thomas Lind in the ''NCIS'' episode \"[[A Man Walks Into a Bar...]]\".</ref> Steven Culp (Clayton Webb on ''JAG''),<ref>Steven Culp played Commander William Skinner in the ''NCIS'' fifth-season episode \"[[NCIS (season 5)#ep100|Chimera]]\".</ref> Randy Vazquez (Victor Galindez on ''JAG''),<ref>Randy Vazquez played ATF Special Agent Phillip Caffey in the ''NCIS'' twelfth-season episode \"[[NCIS (season 12)#ep278|No Good Deed]]\".</ref> and [[Michael Bellisario]] ([[Mikey Roberts]] on ''JAG'');<ref>Recurring part as [[List of NCIS characters#Charles .22Chip.22 Sterling|Chip Sterling]] in four episodes (\"[[NCIS (season 3)#ep52|The Voyeur's Web]]\", \"[[NCIS (season 3)#ep53|Honor Code]]\", \"[[NCIS (season 3)#ep54|Under Covers]]\", and \"[[NCIS (season 3)#ep55|Frame Up]]\") of the third season of ''NCIS''.</ref> they played completely different characters when appearing on ''NCIS''. Similarly, after [[Sean Murray (actor)|Sean Murray]] (Donald Bellisario's stepson) played a one-off Ensign character in ''JAG'' season 4, and the recurring character of Danny Walden in season 6, he joined the core cast of ''NCIS'' during the first season as Tim McGee, and is still on the show as of 2019.\n\nFirst introduced in the NCIS back-door pilot, [[Alicia Coppola]] appeared as Navy judge advocate Lieutenant Commander Faith Coleman in several episodes of ''NCIS''.<ref>''NCIS'' episodes: \"[[NCIS (season 1)#ep18|UnSEALeD]]\", \"[[NCIS (season 2)#7|Call of Silence]]\" and \"[[NCIS (season 2)#ep44|Hometown Hero]]\".</ref> [[Adam Baldwin]] played the same guest role, Navy SEAL Commander Michael Rainer, in one episode of each show.<ref>''JAG'': \"[[List of JAG episodes#ep195|Good Intentions]]\"'' NCIS'': \"[[NCIS (season 1)#ep22|A Weak Link]]\" (first season).</ref>\n\n===''First Monday'' cross-over===\n''[[First Monday]]'' was a short-lived series co-created by Bellisario and [[Paul Levine]] about fictional [[U.S. Supreme Court]] justices and their clerks, which aired in 2002 and starred [[James Garner]] and [[Joe Mantegna]]. The character of [[U.S. Senator]] Edward Sheffield ([[Dean Stockwell]]), who appeared in three episodes of that show, later became a recurring character on ''JAG'' as the new [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]], starting in season eight.\n\n===''Yes, Dear'' tribute===\nThe sitcom ''[[Yes, Dear]]'' did an episode called \"Let's Get Jaggy With It\" where Greg's father Tom ([[Tim Conway]]) wins a walk-on role on ''JAG''. Catherine Bell guest-starred as herself while David James Elliott, Patrick Labyorteaux, and Scott Lawrence guest-starred as their respective ''JAG'' characters.\n\n==Home media==\nOn September 1, 1998, the pilot episode of ''JAG'' was released on [[VHS]] cassette in the U.S. by [[Paramount Home Entertainment]]. However, no further episodes of the series proper were released on any home entertainment media while the show was still in production, allegedly due to syndication deals made with several broadcasters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortunecity.com/lavendar/pulpfiction/99/jag.faq.txt |title=JAG faq |accessdate=2013-09-17 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305193454/http://www.fortunecity.com/lavendar/pulpfiction/99/jag.faq.txt |archivedate=March 5, 2012 }}, Retrieved on 2013-09-17.</ref>\n\nBeginning in 2006, [[CBS Home Entertainment]] (distributed by [[Paramount Home Entertainment|Paramount]]) has released all 10 seasons on DVD in regions 1, 2 and 4.<ref>[http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/shows/JAG/2445#News JAG] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217115007/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/shows/JAG/2445 |date=February 17, 2013 }}, [[TVShowsOnDVD.com]]. retrieved on 2013-09-17.</ref> Seasons 1 to 4 are released with a 4:3 [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], while seasons 5 to 10 have a 16:9 aspect ratio.

Chloroplast thylakoids frequently form stacks of disks referred to as '''grana''' (singular: '''granum'''). Grana are connected by intergranal/ stroma thylakoids, which join granum stacks together as a single functional compartment.\n\n==Etymology==\nI hatehomework\n\n==Structure==\n[[Image:Granum.svg|thumb|250px|Thylakoid structures]]\n[[Image:chloroplast in leaf of Anemone sp TEM 85000x.png|thumb|250px|right|[[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]] image of grana]]\n\nThylakoids are membrane-bound structures embedded in the chloroplast [[stroma (fluid)|stroma]].

It plays an important role for [[photophosphorylation]] during [[photosynthesis]]. During the light-dependent reaction, protons are pumped across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen making it acidic down to pH 4.\n\n===Granum and stroma lamellae===\n\nIn higher plants thylakoids are organized into a granum-stroma membrane assembly. A '''granum''' (plural '''grana''') is a stack of thylakoid discs. Chloroplasts can have from 10 to 100 grana. Grana are connected by stroma thylakoids, also called intergranal thylakoids or '''lamellae'''. Grana thylakoids and stroma thylakoids can be distinguished by their different protein composition. Grana contribute to chloroplasts' large surface area to volume ratio. Different interpretations of [[electron tomography]] imaging of thylakoid membranes has resulted in two models for grana structure. Both posit that lamellae intersect grana stacks in parallel sheets, though whether these sheets intersect in planes perpendicular to the grana stack axis, or are arranged in a right-handed [[helix]] is debated.<ref name=\"Mustardy\">{{cite journal |title=The Three-Dimensional Network of the Thylakoid Membranes in Plants: Quasihelical Model of the Granum-Stroma Assembly | journal=Plant Cell |volume=20 |pages=2552\u20132557 |year=2008 |author=Must\u00e1rdy, L. |author2=Buttle, K. |author3=Steinbach, G. |author4=Garab, G. |doi=10.1105/tpc.108.059147 |pmid=18952780 |issue=10 |pmc=2590735}}</ref>\n\n==Formation==\nChloroplasts develop from [[proplastid]]s when [[seedling]]s emerge from the ground. Thylakoid formation requires light. In the plant embryo and in the absence of light, proplastids develop into [[etioplast]]s that contain semicrystalline membrane structures called prolamellar bodies. When exposed to light, these prolamellar bodies develop into thylakoids. This does not happen in seedlings grown in the dark, which undergo [[etiolation]]. An underexposure to light can cause the thylakoids to fail. This causes the chloroplasts to fail resulting in the death of the plant.\n\nThylakoid formation requires the action of ''vesicle-inducing protein in plastids 1'' (VIPP1). Plants cannot survive without this protein, and reduced VIPP1 levels lead to slower growth and paler plants with reduced ability to photosynthesize. VIPP1 appears to be required for basic thylakoid membrane formation, but not for the assembly of protein complexes of the thylakoid membrane.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Vipp1 is required for basic thylakoid membrane formation but not for the assembly of thylakoid protein complexes |journal=Plant Physiol Biochem |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=119\u201328 |year=2007 |pmid=17346982 |doi=10.1016/j.plaphy.2007.01.005 |author1=Elena Aseeva |author2=Friederich Ossenb\u00fchl |author3=Claudia Sippel |author4=Won K.

There are four major protein complexes in the thylakoid membrane:\n*[[Photosystem]]s [[Photosystem I|I]] and [[Photosystem II|II]]\n*[[Cytochrome b6f complex]]\n*[[ATP synthase]]\n\nPhotosystem II is located mostly in the grana thylakoids, whereas photosystem I and ATP synthase are mostly located in the stroma thylakoids and the outer layers of grana. The cytochrome b6f complex is distributed evenly throughout thylakoid membranes. Due to the separate location of the two photosystems in the thylakoid membrane system, mobile electron carriers are required to shuttle electrons between them. These carriers are plastoquinone and plastocyanin. Plastoquinone shuttles electrons from photosystem II to the cytochrome b6f complex, whereas plastocyanin carries electrons from the cytochrome b6f complex to photosystem I.\n\nTogether, these proteins make use of light energy to drive [[electron transport chain]]s that generate a [[chemiosmotic potential]] across the thylakoid membrane and [[NADPH]], a product of the terminal [[redox]] reaction. The [[ATP synthase]] uses the chemiosmotic potential to make [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] during [[photophosphorylation]].\n\n====Photosystems====\n{{main|Photosystem}}\n\nThese photosystems are light-driven redox centers, each consisting of an [[antenna complex]] that uses [[chlorophyll]]s and accessory [[photosynthetic pigment]]s such as [[carotenoids]] and [[phycobiliprotein]]s to harvest light at a variety of wavelengths. Each antenna complex has between 250 and 400 pigment molecules and the energy they absorb is shuttled by resonance energy transfer to a specialized chlorophyll ''a'' at the reaction center of each photosystem. When either of the two chlorophyll ''a'' molecules at the reaction center absorbs energy, an electron is excited and transferred to an electron-acceptor molecule. '''Photosystem I''' contains a pair of chlorophyll ''a'' molecules, designated [[P700]], at its reaction center that maximally absorbs 700&nbsp;nm light. '''Photosystem II''' contains [[P680]] chlorophyll that absorbs 680&nbsp;nm light best (note that these wavelengths correspond to deep red \u2013 see the [[visible spectrum]]). The P is short for pigment and the number is the specific absorption peak in nanometers for the chlorophyll molecules in each reaction center.\n\n====Cytochrome b6f complex====\n{{main|Cytochrome b6f complex}}\nThe cytochrome b6f complex is part of the thylakoid electron transport chain and couples electron transfer to the pumping of protons into the thylakoid lumen. Energetically, it is situated between the two photosystems and transfers electrons from photosystem II-plastoquinone to plastocyanin-photosystem I.\n\n====ATP synthase====\n{{main|ATP synthase}}\nThe thylakoid ATP synthase is a CF1FO-ATP synthase similar to the mitochondrial ATPase. It is integrated into the thylakoid membrane with the CF1-part sticking into stroma. Thus, ATP synthesis occurs on the stromal side of the thylakoids where the ATP is needed for the [[light-independent reaction]]s of photosynthesis.\n\n===Lumen proteins===\nThe electron transport protein [[plastocyanin]] is present in the lumen and shuttles electrons from the cytochrome b6f protein complex to photosystem I. While plastoquinones are lipid-soluble and therefore move within the thylakoid membrane, plastocyanin moves through the thylakoid lumen.\n\nThe lumen of the thylakoids is also the site of water oxidation by the [[oxygen evolving complex]] associated with the lumenal side of photosystem II.\n\nLumenal proteins can be predicted computationally based on their targeting signals. In Arabidopsis, out of the predicted lumenal proteins possessing the [[Twin-arginine translocation pathway|Tat]] signal, the largest groups with known functions are 19% involved in protein processing (proteolysis and folding), 18% in photosynthesis, 11% in metabolism, and 7% redox carriers and defense.<ref name=\"Peltier2002\"/>\n\n===Protein expression===\nChloroplasts have their own [[genome]], which encodes a number of thylakoid proteins. However, during the course of plastid evolution from their cyanobacterial [[endosymbiont|endosymbiotic]] ancestors, extensive gene transfer from the chloroplast genome to the [[cell nucleus]] took place. This results in the four major thylakoid protein complexes being encoded in part by the chloroplast genome and in part by the nuclear genome. Plants have developed several mechanisms to co-regulate the expression of the different subunits encoded in the two different organelles to assure the proper [[stoichiometry]] and assembly of these protein complexes. For example, [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of nuclear genes encoding parts of the photosynthetic apparatus is regulated by [[light]]. Biogenesis, stability and turnover of thylakoid protein complexes are regulated by [[phosphorylation]] via redox-sensitive [[kinase]]s in the thylakoid membranes.<ref name=\"Vener\">{{cite journal |title=Protein phosphorylation and redox sensing in chloroplast thylakoids |journal=Curr Opin Plant Biol |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=217\u201323 |year=1998 |pmid=10066592 |doi=10.1016/S1369-5266(98)80107-6 |author1=Vener AV |author2=Ohad I |author3=Andersson B |name-list-format=vanc}}</ref> The [[translation (biology)|translation]] rate of chloroplast-encoded proteins is controlled by the presence or absence of assembly partners (control by epistasy of synthesis).<ref name=\"Choquet\">{{cite journal |title=Assembly-controlled regulation of chloroplast gene translation |journal=Biochem Soc Trans |volume=29 |issue=Pt 4 |pages=421\u20136 |year=2001 |pmid=11498001 |doi=10.1042/BST0290421 |author1=Choquet Y |author2=Wostrikoff K |author3=Rimbault B |author4=Zito F |author5=Girard-Bascou J |author6=Drapier D |author7=Wollman F |name-list-format=vanc}}</ref> This mechanism involves [[negative feedback]] through binding of excess protein to the 5' untranslated region of the chloroplast [[mRNA]].<ref name=\"Minai\">{{cite journal |title=Chloroplast Biogenesis of Photosystem II Cores Involves a Series of Assembly-Controlled Steps That Regulate Translation |journal=Plant Cell |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=159\u201375 |year=2006 |pmid=16339851 |doi=10.1105/tpc.105.037705 |author1=Minai L |author2=Wostrikoff K |author3=Wollman F |author4=Choquet Y |name-list-format=vanc |pmc=1323491}}</ref> Chloroplasts also need to balance the ratios of photosystem I and II for the electron transfer chain.

Most thylakoid proteins encoded by a plant's nuclear genome need two targeting signals for proper localization: An N-terminal chloroplast targeting peptide (shown in yellow in the figure), followed by a thylakoid targeting peptide (shown in blue). Proteins are imported through the translocon of outer and inner membrane ([[TIC/TOC complex|Toc and Tic]]) complexes. After entering the chloroplast, the first targeting peptide is cleaved off by a protease processing imported proteins. This unmasks the second targeting signal and the protein is exported from the stroma into the thylakoid in a second targeting step. This second step requires the action of protein translocation components of the thylakoids and is energy-dependent. Proteins are inserted into the membrane via the SRP-dependent pathway (1), the [[Twin-arginine translocation pathway|Tat-dependent pathway]] (2), or spontaneously via their transmembrane domains (not shown in figure). Lumenal proteins are exported across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen by either the Tat-dependent pathway (2) or the Sec-dependent pathway (3) and released by cleavage from the thylakoid targeting signal. The different pathways utilize different signals and energy sources. The Sec (secretory) pathway requires ATP as energy source and consists of SecA, which binds to the imported protein and a Sec membrane complex to shuttle the protein across. Proteins with a twin [[arginine]] motif in their thylakoid signal peptide are shuttled through the Tat (twin arginine translocation) pathway, which requires a membrane-bound Tat complex and the pH gradient as an energy source. Some other proteins are inserted into the membrane via the SRP ([[signal recognition particle]]) pathway. The chloroplast SRP can interact with its target proteins either post-translationally or co-translationally, thus transporting imported proteins as well as those that are translated inside the chloroplast. The SRP pathway requires GTP and the pH gradient as energy sources. Some transmembrane proteins may also spontaneously insert into the membrane from the stromal side without energy requirement.<ref name=\"Gutensohn\">{{cite journal |title=Toc, Tic, Tat et al.: structure and function of protein transport machineries in chloroplasts |journal=J.

These include light-driven water oxidation and [[oxygen evolution]], the pumping of protons across the thylakoid membranes coupled with the electron transport chain of the photosystems and cytochrome complex, and ATP synthesis by the ATP synthase utilizing the generated proton gradient.\n\n===Water photolysis===\n{{main|photolysis}}\nThe first step in photosynthesis is the light-driven reduction (splitting) of water to provide the electrons for the photosynthetic electron transport chains as well as protons for the establishment of a proton gradient. The water-splitting reaction occurs on the lumenal side of the thylakoid membrane and is driven by the light energy captured by the photosystems. This oxidation of water conveniently produces the waste product O<sub>2</sub> that is vital for [[cellular respiration]]. The molecular oxygen formed by the reaction is released into the atmosphere.\n\n===Electron transport chains===\n{{main|electron transport chain}}\nTwo different variations of electron transport are used during photosynthesis:\n* '''Noncyclic electron transport''' or '''Non-cyclic photophosphorylation''' produces NADPH + H<sup>+</sup> and ATP.\n* '''Cyclic electron transport''' or '''Cyclic photophosphorylation''' produces only ATP.\n\nThe noncyclic variety involves the participation of both photosystems, while the cyclic electron flow is dependent on only photosystem I.\n\n* '''Photosystem I''' uses light energy to reduce NADP<sup>+</sup> to NADPH + H<sup>+</sup>, and is active in both noncyclic and cyclic electron transport. In cyclic mode, the energized electron is passed down a chain that ultimately returns it (in its base state) to the chlorophyll that energized it.\n* '''Photosystem II''' uses light energy to oxidize water molecules, producing electrons (e<sup>\u2212</sup>), protons (H<sup>+</sup>), and molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), and is only active in noncyclic transport. Electrons in this system are not conserved, but are rather continually entering from oxidized 2H<sub>2</sub>O (O<sub>2</sub> + 4 H<sup>+</sup> + 4 e<sup>\u2212</sup>) and exiting with NADP<sup>+</sup> when it is finally reduced to NADPH.\n\n===Chemiosmosis===\n{{main|chemiosmosis}}\nA major function of the thylakoid membrane and its integral photosystems is the establishment of chemiosmotic potential. The carriers in the electron transport chain use some of the electron's energy to actively transport protons from the [[stromal cell|stroma]] to the [[thylakoid lumen|lumen]]. During photosynthesis, the lumen becomes [[acidic]], as low as pH 4, compared to pH 8 in the stroma.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jagendorf A. T. and E.

From the plastoquinone pool, electrons pass through the cytochrome b6f complex. This integral membrane assembly resembles cytochrome bc1.\n* The reduction of [[plastoquinone]] by [[ferredoxin]] during [[Light-dependent reactions|cyclic electron transport]] also transfers two protons from the stroma to the lumen.\nThe proton gradient is also caused by the consumptions of protons in the stroma to make NADPH from NADP+ at the NADP reductase.\n\n====ATP generation====\nThe molecular mechanism of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) generation in chloroplasts is similar to that in [[mitochondria]] and takes the required energy from the [[proton motive force]] (PMF).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} However, chloroplasts rely more on the [[chemical potential]] of the PMF to generate the potential energy required for ATP synthesis. The PMF is the sum of a proton chemical potential (given by the proton concentration gradient) and a transmembrane [[electrical potential]] (given by charge separation across the membrane). Compared to the inner membranes of mitochondria, which have a significantly higher [[membrane potential]] due to charge separation, thylakoid membranes lack a charge gradient.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} To compensate for this, the 10,000 fold proton concentration gradient across the thylakoid membrane is much higher compared to a 10 fold gradient across the inner membrane of mitochondria. The resulting [[chemiosmotic potential]] between the lumen and [[stromal cell|stroma]] is high enough to drive ATP synthesis using the [[ATP synthase]]. As the protons travel back down the gradient through channels in [[ATP synthase]], ADP + P<sub>i</sub> are combined into ATP. In this manner, the [[light-dependent reactions]] are coupled to the synthesis of ATP via the proton gradient.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n==Thylakoid membranes in cyanobacteria==\n[[File:Synechocystis.svg|thumb|250px|Thylakoids (green) inside a cyanobacterium (''Synechocystis'')]]\n[[Cyanobacteria]] are photosynthetic prokaryotes with highly differentiated membrane systems.

A '''granum''' (plural '''grana''') is a stack of thylakoid discs. Chloroplasts can have from 10 to 100 grana. Grana are connected by stroma thylakoids, also called intergranal thylakoids or '''lamellae'''. Grana thylakoids and stroma thylakoids can be distinguished by their different protein composition. Grana contribute to chloroplasts' large surface area to volume ratio. Different interpretations of [[electron tomography]] imaging of thylakoid membranes has resulted in two models for grana structure. Both posit that lamellae intersect grana stacks in parallel sheets, though whether these sheets intersect in planes perpendicular to the grana stack axis, or are arranged in a right-handed [[helix]] is debated.<ref name=\"Mustardy\">{{cite journal |title=The Three-Dimensional Network of the Thylakoid Membranes in Plants: Quasihelical Model of the Granum-Stroma Assembly | journal=Plant Cell |volume=20 |pages=2552\u20132557 |year=2008 |author=Must\u00e1rdy, L. |author2=Buttle, K. |author3=Steinbach, G. |author4=Garab, G. |doi=10.1105/tpc.108.059147 |pmid=18952780 |issue=10 |pmc=2590735}}</ref>\n\n==Formation==\nChloroplasts develop from [[proplastid]]s when [[seedling]]s emerge from the ground. Thylakoid formation requires light. In the plant embryo and in the absence of light, proplastids develop into [[etioplast]]s that contain semicrystalline membrane structures called prolamellar bodies. When exposed to light, these prolamellar bodies develop into thylakoids. This does not happen in seedlings grown in the dark, which undergo [[etiolation]]. An underexposure to light can cause the thylakoids to fail. This causes the chloroplasts to fail resulting in the death of the plant.\n\nThylakoid formation requires the action of ''vesicle-inducing protein in plastids 1'' (VIPP1). Plants cannot survive without this protein, and reduced VIPP1 levels lead to slower growth and paler plants with reduced ability to photosynthesize. VIPP1 appears to be required for basic thylakoid membrane formation, but not for the assembly of protein complexes of the thylakoid membrane.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Vipp1 is required for basic thylakoid membrane formation but not for the assembly of thylakoid protein complexes |journal=Plant Physiol Biochem |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=119\u201328 |year=2007 |pmid=17346982 |doi=10.1016/j.plaphy.2007.01.005 |author1=Elena Aseeva |author2=Friederich Ossenb\u00fchl |author3=Claudia Sippel |author4=Won K.

There are four major protein complexes in the thylakoid membrane:\n*[[Photosystem]]s [[Photosystem I|I]] and [[Photosystem II|II]]\n*[[Cytochrome b6f complex]]\n*[[ATP synthase]]\n\nPhotosystem II is located mostly in the grana thylakoids, whereas photosystem I and ATP synthase are mostly located in the stroma thylakoids and the outer layers of grana. The cytochrome b6f complex is distributed evenly throughout thylakoid membranes. Due to the separate location of the two photosystems in the thylakoid membrane system, mobile electron carriers are required to shuttle electrons between them. These carriers are plastoquinone and plastocyanin. Plastoquinone shuttles electrons from photosystem II to the cytochrome b6f complex, whereas plastocyanin carries electrons from the cytochrome b6f complex to photosystem I.\n\nTogether, these proteins make use of light energy to drive [[electron transport chain]]s that generate a [[chemiosmotic potential]] across the thylakoid membrane and [[NADPH]], a product of the terminal [[redox]] reaction. The [[ATP synthase]] uses the chemiosmotic potential to make [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] during [[photophosphorylation]].\n\n====Photosystems====\n{{main|Photosystem}}\n\nThese photosystems are light-driven redox centers, each consisting of an [[antenna complex]] that uses [[chlorophyll]]s and accessory [[photosynthetic pigment]]s such as [[carotenoids]] and [[phycobiliprotein]]s to harvest light at a variety of wavelengths. Each antenna complex has between 250 and 400 pigment molecules and the energy they absorb is shuttled by resonance energy transfer to a specialized chlorophyll ''a'' at the reaction center of each photosystem. When either of the two chlorophyll ''a'' molecules at the reaction center absorbs energy, an electron is excited and transferred to an electron-acceptor molecule. '''Photosystem I''' contains a pair of chlorophyll ''a'' molecules, designated [[P700]], at its reaction center that maximally absorbs 700&nbsp;nm light. '''Photosystem II''' contains [[P680]] chlorophyll that absorbs 680&nbsp;nm light best (note that these wavelengths correspond to deep red \u2013 see the [[visible spectrum]]). The P is short for pigment and the number is the specific absorption peak in nanometers for the chlorophyll molecules in each reaction center.\n\n====Cytochrome b6f complex====\n{{main|Cytochrome b6f complex}}\nThe cytochrome b6f complex is part of the thylakoid electron transport chain and couples electron transfer to the pumping of protons into the thylakoid lumen. Energetically, it is situated between the two photosystems and transfers electrons from photosystem II-plastoquinone to plastocyanin-photosystem I.\n\n====ATP synthase====\n{{main|ATP synthase}}\nThe thylakoid ATP synthase is a CF1FO-ATP synthase similar to the mitochondrial ATPase. It is integrated into the thylakoid membrane with the CF1-part sticking into stroma. Thus, ATP synthesis occurs on the stromal side of the thylakoids where the ATP is needed for the [[light-independent reaction]]s of photosynthesis.\n\n===Lumen proteins===\nThe electron transport protein [[plastocyanin]] is present in the lumen and shuttles electrons from the cytochrome b6f protein complex to photosystem I. While plastoquinones are lipid-soluble and therefore move within the thylakoid membrane, plastocyanin moves through the thylakoid lumen.\n\nThe lumen of the thylakoids is also the site of water oxidation by the [[oxygen evolving complex]] associated with the lumenal side of photosystem II.\n\nLumenal proteins can be predicted computationally based on their targeting signals. In Arabidopsis, out of the predicted lumenal proteins possessing the [[Twin-arginine translocation pathway|Tat]] signal, the largest groups with known functions are 19% involved in protein processing (proteolysis and folding), 18% in photosynthesis, 11% in metabolism, and 7% redox carriers and defense.<ref name=\"Peltier2002\"/>\n\n===Protein expression===\nChloroplasts have their own [[genome]], which encodes a number of thylakoid proteins. However, during the course of plastid evolution from their cyanobacterial [[endosymbiont|endosymbiotic]] ancestors, extensive gene transfer from the chloroplast genome to the [[cell nucleus]] took place. This results in the four major thylakoid protein complexes being encoded in part by the chloroplast genome and in part by the nuclear genome. Plants have developed several mechanisms to co-regulate the expression of the different subunits encoded in the two different organelles to assure the proper [[stoichiometry]] and assembly of these protein complexes. For example, [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of nuclear genes encoding parts of the photosynthetic apparatus is regulated by [[light]]. Biogenesis, stability and turnover of thylakoid protein complexes are regulated by [[phosphorylation]] via redox-sensitive [[kinase]]s in the thylakoid membranes.<ref name=\"Vener\">{{cite journal |title=Protein phosphorylation and redox sensing in chloroplast thylakoids |journal=Curr Opin Plant Biol |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=217\u201323 |year=1998 |pmid=10066592 |doi=10.1016/S1369-5266(98)80107-6 |author1=Vener AV |author2=Ohad I |author3=Andersson B |name-list-format=vanc}}</ref> The [[translation (biology)|translation]] rate of chloroplast-encoded proteins is controlled by the presence or absence of assembly partners (control by epistasy of synthesis).<ref name=\"Choquet\">{{cite journal |title=Assembly-controlled regulation of chloroplast gene translation |journal=Biochem Soc Trans |volume=29 |issue=Pt 4 |pages=421\u20136 |year=2001 |pmid=11498001 |doi=10.1042/BST0290421 |author1=Choquet Y |author2=Wostrikoff K |author3=Rimbault B |author4=Zito F |author5=Girard-Bascou J |author6=Drapier D |author7=Wollman F |name-list-format=vanc}}</ref> This mechanism involves [[negative feedback]] through binding of excess protein to the 5' untranslated region of the chloroplast [[mRNA]].<ref name=\"Minai\">{{cite journal |title=Chloroplast Biogenesis of Photosystem II Cores Involves a Series of Assembly-Controlled Steps That Regulate Translation |journal=Plant Cell |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=159\u201375 |year=2006 |pmid=16339851 |doi=10.1105/tpc.105.037705 |author1=Minai L |author2=Wostrikoff K |author3=Wollman F |author4=Choquet Y |name-list-format=vanc |pmc=1323491}}</ref> Chloroplasts also need to balance the ratios of photosystem I and II for the electron transfer chain.

Most thylakoid proteins encoded by a plant's nuclear genome need two targeting signals for proper localization: An N-terminal chloroplast targeting peptide (shown in yellow in the figure), followed by a thylakoid targeting peptide (shown in blue). Proteins are imported through the translocon of outer and inner membrane ([[TIC/TOC complex|Toc and Tic]]) complexes. After entering the chloroplast, the first targeting peptide is cleaved off by a protease processing imported proteins. This unmasks the second targeting signal and the protein is exported from the stroma into the thylakoid in a second targeting step. This second step requires the action of protein translocation components of the thylakoids and is energy-dependent. Proteins are inserted into the membrane via the SRP-dependent pathway (1), the [[Twin-arginine translocation pathway|Tat-dependent pathway]] (2), or spontaneously via their transmembrane domains (not shown in figure). Lumenal proteins are exported across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen by either the Tat-dependent pathway (2) or the Sec-dependent pathway (3) and released by cleavage from the thylakoid targeting signal. The different pathways utilize different signals and energy sources. The Sec (secretory) pathway requires ATP as energy source and consists of SecA, which binds to the imported protein and a Sec membrane complex to shuttle the protein across. Proteins with a twin [[arginine]] motif in their thylakoid signal peptide are shuttled through the Tat (twin arginine translocation) pathway, which requires a membrane-bound Tat complex and the pH gradient as an energy source. Some other proteins are inserted into the membrane via the SRP ([[signal recognition particle]]) pathway. The chloroplast SRP can interact with its target proteins either post-translationally or co-translationally, thus transporting imported proteins as well as those that are translated inside the chloroplast. The SRP pathway requires GTP and the pH gradient as energy sources. Some transmembrane proteins may also spontaneously insert into the membrane from the stromal side without energy requirement.<ref name=\"Gutensohn\">{{cite journal |title=Toc, Tic, Tat et al.: structure and function of protein transport machineries in chloroplasts |journal=J.

These include light-driven water oxidation and [[oxygen evolution]], the pumping of protons across the thylakoid membranes coupled with the electron transport chain of the photosystems and cytochrome complex, and ATP synthesis by the ATP synthase utilizing the generated proton gradient.\n\n===Water photolysis===\n{{main|photolysis}}\nThe first step in photosynthesis is the light-driven reduction (splitting) of water to provide the electrons for the photosynthetic electron transport chains as well as protons for the establishment of a proton gradient. The water-splitting reaction occurs on the lumenal side of the thylakoid membrane and is driven by the light energy captured by the photosystems. This oxidation of water conveniently produces the waste product O<sub>2</sub> that is vital for [[cellular respiration]]. The molecular oxygen formed by the reaction is released into the atmosphere.\n\n===Electron transport chains===\n{{main|electron transport chain}}\nTwo different variations of electron transport are used during photosynthesis:\n* '''Noncyclic electron transport''' or '''Non-cyclic photophosphorylation''' produces NADPH + H<sup>+</sup> and ATP.\n* '''Cyclic electron transport''' or '''Cyclic photophosphorylation''' produces only ATP.\n\nThe noncyclic variety involves the participation of both photosystems, while the cyclic electron flow is dependent on only photosystem I.\n\n* '''Photosystem I''' uses light energy to reduce NADP<sup>+</sup> to NADPH + H<sup>+</sup>, and is active in both noncyclic and cyclic electron transport. In cyclic mode, the energized electron is passed down a chain that ultimately returns it (in its base state) to the chlorophyll that energized it.\n* '''Photosystem II''' uses light energy to oxidize water molecules, producing electrons (e<sup>\u2212</sup>), protons (H<sup>+</sup>), and molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), and is only active in noncyclic transport. Electrons in this system are not conserved, but are rather continually entering from oxidized 2H<sub>2</sub>O (O<sub>2</sub> + 4 H<sup>+</sup> + 4 e<sup>\u2212</sup>) and exiting with NADP<sup>+</sup> when it is finally reduced to NADPH.\n\n===Chemiosmosis===\n{{main|chemiosmosis}}\nA major function of the thylakoid membrane and its integral photosystems is the establishment of chemiosmotic potential. The carriers in the electron transport chain use some of the electron's energy to actively transport protons from the [[stromal cell|stroma]] to the [[thylakoid lumen|lumen]]. During photosynthesis, the lumen becomes [[acidic]], as low as pH 4, compared to pH 8 in the stroma.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jagendorf A. T. and E. Uribe|title=ATP formation caused by acid-base transition of spinach chloroplasts.|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA|date=1966|volume=55|issue=1|pages=170\u2013177|doi=10.1073/pnas.55.1.170|pmid=5220864|pmc=285771}}</ref> This represents a 10,000 fold concentration gradient for [[proton]]s across the thylakoid membrane.\n\n====Source of proton gradient====\nThe protons in the lumen come from three primary sources.\n*[[Photolysis]] by [[photosystem II]] oxidises water to [[oxygen]], protons and [[electron]]s in the lumen.\n*The transfer of electrons from photosystem II to [[plastoquinone]] during [[Light-dependent reactions|non-cyclic electron transport]] consumes two protons from the stroma. These are released in the lumen when the reduced plastoquinol is oxidized by the cytochrome b6f protein complex on the lumen side of the thylakoid membrane. From the plastoquinone pool, electrons pass through the cytochrome b6f complex. This integral membrane assembly resembles cytochrome bc1.\n* The reduction of [[plastoquinone]] by [[ferredoxin]] during [[Light-dependent reactions|cyclic electron transport]] also transfers two protons from the stroma to the lumen.\nThe proton gradient is also caused by the consumptions of protons in the stroma to make NADPH from NADP+ at the NADP reductase.\n\n====ATP generation====\nThe molecular mechanism of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) generation in chloroplasts is similar to that in [[mitochondria]] and takes the required energy from the [[proton motive force]] (PMF).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} However, chloroplasts rely more on the [[chemical potential]] of the PMF to generate the potential energy required for ATP synthesis. The PMF is the sum of a proton chemical potential (given by the proton concentration gradient) and a transmembrane [[electrical potential]] (given by charge separation across the membrane). Compared to the inner membranes of mitochondria, which have a significantly higher [[membrane potential]] due to charge separation, thylakoid membranes lack a charge gradient.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} To compensate for this, the 10,000 fold proton concentration gradient across the thylakoid membrane is much higher compared to a 10 fold gradient across the inner membrane of mitochondria. The resulting [[chemiosmotic potential]] between the lumen and [[stromal cell|stroma]] is high enough to drive ATP synthesis using the [[ATP synthase]]. As the protons travel back down the gradient through channels in [[ATP synthase]], ADP + P<sub>i</sub> are combined into ATP. In this manner, the [[light-dependent reactions]] are coupled to the synthesis of ATP via the proton gradient.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n==Thylakoid membranes in cyanobacteria==\n[[File:Synechocystis.svg|thumb|250px|Thylakoids (green) inside a cyanobacterium (''Synechocystis'')]]\n[[Cyanobacteria]] are photosynthetic prokaryotes with highly differentiated membrane systems.  Cyanobacteria have an internal system of thylakoid membranes where the fully functional electron transfer chains of [[photosynthesis]] and [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] reside.  The presence of different membrane systems lends these cells a unique complexity among [[bacteria]].  Cyanobacteria must be able to reorganize the membranes, synthesize new membrane lipids, and properly target proteins to the correct membrane system.  The [[Bacterial outer membrane|outer membrane]], [[plasma membrane]], and thylakoid membranes each have specialized roles in the cyanobacterial cell.  Understanding the organization, functionality, protein composition and dynamics of the membrane systems remains a great challenge in cyanobacterial cell biology.<ref name=Herrero>{{cite book | author = Herrero A and Flores E (editor). | title = The Cyanobacteria: Molecular Biology, Genomics and Evolution | edition = 1st | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2008 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/cyan | id = [http://www.horizonpress.com/cyan ] | isbn = 978-1-904455-15-8}}</ref>\n\nThe thylakoid membranes of the cyanobacteria are not differentiated into granum and stroma regions as observed in plants.

The railways were largely constructed by Russian engineers and indentured workers. The Chinese Eastern Railway extended the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]]: substantially reducing the distance from [[Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai|Chita]] to [[Vladivostok]] and also linking the new port city of Dalny ([[Dalian]]) and the Russian Naval Base Port Arthur ([[L\u00fcshun]]). The settlement founded by the Russian-owned Chinese Eastern Railway quickly turned into a \"boomtown,\" growing into a city within five years. The majority of settlers in Harbin came from southern Ukraine (Russian Empire). In addition to Ukrainians there were many Russians, Jews, Poles, Georgians, and Tatars, {{sfn|Karlinsky|2013|p=311}}\n\nThe city was intended as a showcase for Russian imperialism in Asia and the American scholar Simon Karlinsky who was born in Harbin in 1924 into a Russian Jewish family wrote that in Harbin: \"the buildings, boulevards, and parks were planned\u2014well before the October Revolution\u2014by distinguished Russian architects and also by Swiss and Italian town planners\", giving the city a very European appearance.{{sfn|Karlinsky|2013|p=311}} Starting in the late 19th century, a mass influx of Han Chinese arrived in Manchuria, and taking advantage of the rich soils, founded farms which soon turned Manchuria into the \"breadbasket of China\" while others went to work in the mines and factories of Manchuria, which become one of the first regions of China to industrialize.  Harbin became one of the main points through which food and industrial products were shipped out of Manchuria.  A sign of Harbin's wealth was that a theater had established during its first decade and in 1907 the play ''K zvezdam'' by [[Leonid Andreyev]] had its premiere there.{{sfn|Karlinsky|2013|pp=312-313}}  \u00a0\n\n[[File:Harbin 1940 st.nicolas.jpg|thumb|left|St. Nicolas Orthodox, a [[Russian Orthodox]] church in Harbin, circa 1940, demolished during the [[Cultural Revolution]]]]\n\nDuring the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904\u201305), Russia used Harbin as its base for military operations in Manchuria. Following Russia's defeat, its influence declined. Several thousand nationals from 33 countries, including the United States, Germany, and France, moved to Harbin. Sixteen countries established consulates to serve their nationals, who established several hundred industrial, commercial and banking companies.

The Chinese Eastern Railway extended the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]]: substantially reducing the distance from [[Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai|Chita]] to [[Vladivostok]] and also linking the new port city of Dalny ([[Dalian]]) and the Russian Naval Base Port Arthur ([[L\u00fcshun]]). The settlement founded by the Russian-owned Chinese Eastern Railway quickly turned into a \"boomtown,\" growing into a city within five years. The majority of settlers in Harbin came from southern Ukraine (Russian Empire). In addition to Ukrainians there were many Russians, Jews, Poles, Georgians, and Tatars, {{sfn|Karlinsky|2013|p=311}}\n\nThe city was intended as a showcase for Russian imperialism in Asia and the American scholar Simon Karlinsky who was born in Harbin in 1924 into a Russian Jewish family wrote that in Harbin: \"the buildings, boulevards, and parks were planned\u2014well before the October Revolution\u2014by distinguished Russian architects and also by Swiss and Italian town planners\", giving the city a very European appearance.{{sfn|Karlinsky|2013|p=311}} Starting in the late 19th century, a mass influx of Han Chinese arrived in Manchuria, and taking advantage of the rich soils, founded farms which soon turned Manchuria into the \"breadbasket of China\" while others went to work in the mines and factories of Manchuria, which become one of the first regions of China to industrialize.  Harbin became one of the main points through which food and industrial products were shipped out of Manchuria.  A sign of Harbin's wealth was that a theater had established during its first decade and in 1907 the play ''K zvezdam'' by [[Leonid Andreyev]] had its premiere there.{{sfn|Karlinsky|2013|pp=312-313}}  \u00a0\n\n[[File:Harbin 1940 st.nicolas.jpg|thumb|left|St. Nicolas Orthodox, a [[Russian Orthodox]] church in Harbin, circa 1940, demolished during the [[Cultural Revolution]]]]\n\nDuring the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904\u201305), Russia used Harbin as its base for military operations in Manchuria. Following Russia's defeat, its influence declined. Several thousand nationals from 33 countries, including the United States, Germany, and France, moved to Harbin. Sixteen countries established consulates to serve their nationals, who established several hundred industrial, commercial and banking companies.

Lee]]. The film also features an [[ensemble cast]] featuring: [[Martin Lawrence]], [[Nicole Ari Parker]], [[Margaret Avery]], [[Michael Clarke Duncan]], [[Mike Epps]], [[Mo'Nique]], [[Cedric the Entertainer]], [[Louis C.K.]], and [[James Earl Jones]].\n\n==Plot==\nDr. R.J. \u201cRoscoe\u201d Stevens ([[Martin Lawrence]]) is a successful talk-show host, having discarded his awkward Southern roots, and is engaged to ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'' winner Bianca Kittles ([[Joy Bryant]]).\n\nBringing Bianca and his 10-year-old son Jamaal (Damani Roberts) to his sleepy Southern hometown for his parents 50th wedding anniversary, R.J. is determined to prove he is no longer the walking disaster his family used to pick on. In Georgia, he is met by his pick-pocketing cousin Reggie ([[Mike Epps]]), and arrives at the family home to greet his parents, Roscoe Sr. ([[James Earl Jones]]) and Mama Jenkins ([[Margaret Avery]]); his brother Otis ([[Michael Clarke Duncan]]), the town sheriff; Otis' wife Ruthie ([[Liz Mikel]]) and their overgrown kids, Junior (Brandin Jenkins) and Callie (Krystal Marea Braud); and Roscoe's rowdy sister Betty ([[Mo'Nique]]). Roscoe's cousin Clyde ([[Cedric the Entertainer]]) drops in, reigniting their past competitiveness, and escorting Lucinda ([[Nicole Ari Parker]]), Roscoe\u2019s past love interest.\n\nRoscoe endures much self-humiliation: he accidentally hits his mother in the head with a softball, is beaten up by Otis and Betty after insulting them, faces constant blackmail by Reggie, and is sprayed by a [[skunk]] while sleeping. It becomes obvious that he still holds a grudge against his father for showing Clyde preferential treatment when they were younger, while Roscoe Sr. resents his son for changing his name and distancing himself from his family. Bianca does not fit in well with the Jenkins, and Roscoe and Lucinda get reacquainted.\n\nOn the Jenkins' anniversary, the whole family gathers for their traditional obstacle course. Roscoe and Clyde aggressively make their way through, hurting themselves and others. When Roscoe begins to help his son over an obstacle, Bianca tells him to leave Jamaal and he does, to his parents' shock. Roscoe and Clyde race to the finish line, and Roscoe wins. As Bianca cheers, Roscoe berates his family, reminding them that it is all about \"the team of me\".\n\nThe family is angry, Jamaal refuses to go near his father, and Roscoe Sr. reprimands his son for his behavior. Unable to contain his resentment, Roscoe lashes out at his father, saying that although Clyde's father died, Roscoe felt he lost his own father because he always favored Clyde, and chastises him for crediting Clyde\u2019s accomplishments while never acknowledging any of Roscoe\u2019s success. Stunned, Roscoe Sr. realizes he is the reason his son left home and walks off feeling guilty. Now seeing why Roscoe resented him, Clyde tells Roscoe he never tried to take his place, but only wanted to be accepted by the family and sees Roscoe as his brother. He tries to shake Roscoe's hand, but Bianca rebuffs him, and Roscoe leaves with Bianca and Jamaal, but not before his mother reminds him that his family still loves him.\n\nDriving to the airport, Bianca proposes not inviting the family to their wedding. Roscoe seems to agree, upsetting Jamaal, who proudly declares himself a Jenkins. Bianca continues to insult the Jenkins clan and Roscoe pretends to agree with her, but dumps her and her bags at the airport. Roscoe and Jamaal return to the family home with Bianca's Pomeranian Fifi, who had pursued a relationship with the Jenkins\u2019 over-aged dog Bucky.\n\nDuring the anniversary celebration, Clyde cries during his speech for Mama and Papa Jenkins, admitting how much he cares about Roscoe, who appears, apologizing to his family and congratulating his parents. He and his father make amends, and Roscoe asks Lucinda to dance. After the celebration, the family watches video of the celebration on a big-screen TV while Roscoe and Lucinda depart to make love, discovering when they enter the bedroom that the dogs Bucky and Fifi had intercourse, too. During the credits, Roscoe interviews his family on his show, renamed ''The Roscoe Jenkins Show''.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Martin Lawrence]] as Dr. RJ Stevens/Roscoe Steven Jenkins, Jr.: a famous talk show host. The main [[protagonist]] of the film.\n* [[Joy Bryant]] as Bianca Kittles: a former ''Survivor'' contestant and R.J.'s fiance.

McLouth\n| products      = Low carbon and stainless strip steel\n}}\n'''McLouth Steel''' is a former integrated steel company. The company was once the ninth largest steelmaker in the country, and had three locations. The first plant was in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the second (and significantly larger) in [[Trenton, Michigan]], and the third, a cold mill, in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]]. The Detroit plant was last owned by Jones & Laughlin Steel Company and has been demolished. The Trenton facility is owned by MSC Land Co. and has also been demolished. The Gibraltar cold mill is owned by Ferrolux, and has been restarted.\n\n==Detroit Complex==\nThis complex was built in 1934 by Donald B. McLouth, a Detroit scrap dealer,  as a small conversion mill on Livernois Avenue in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan|MI]]. Desiring additional options for steel, partial financing was provided by [[General Motors]]. In its later years, the plant was revamped to produce only stainless steel, eventually being bought by [[Jones and Laughlin Steel Company]] in 1981.\n\nThe Detroit mill initially consisted of a small reversing hot rolling strip mill with a slab heating furnace. The original hot strip mill was known as the \"Coffee Grinder\" from the sounds the mill would make. In 1938, the company brought online a single 4-high reversing cold reducing mill with ancillary facilities (annealing and finishing). Throughout the next few years, modifications were made to the equipment and eventually, the company had the capacity to roll 108,000 net tons per year of hot rolled products and 60,000 net tons of cold rolled steel products.\n\nIn 1947, McLouth Steel began rolling stainless steel. Two single stand reversing cold reducing mills were installed with the related supplementary equipment. In 1954, $6,000,000 of the $100,000,000 expansion plan for the new Trenton plant was used to install two 4-high reversing cold rolling mills. With this new addition to the Detroit plant, the stainless steel production increased to 52,000 net tons per year.\n\nThe Detroit plant was a finishing facility for sheet and strip products only. Principal operating units were two {{convert|50|in|mm|adj=on}}., 4-high cold reduction mills, a cold [[Annealing (metallurgy)|anneal]] and pickle line, a [[temper mill]], two slitting lines(36in. and 24in.), and a coil polisher. The two 50in. reduction mills were essentially identical. Both were installed in 1953 by United and had a combined annual capacity of 120,000 tons. The cold anneal and pickle line were installed in 1975 by Production Machinery. The line consisted of an entry end washing section to remove rolling oils, an open air annealing furnace (where the strip was heated above {{convert|1900|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}), and three acid pickling tanks followed by rinsing and drying units. Paper was interleaved between the coil wraps at the exit take up reel to avoid surface abrasion.\n\nCoil product was usually shipped from the Detroit plant via truck.\n\nThe Detroit plant was demolished in 2018.\n\n==Trenton Complex==\n[[File:Actual Trenton Plant.jpg|thumb|A photograph showing the majority of the Trenton, MI plant.]]\nIn 1948, McLouth Steel started its $100 million expansion program by purchasing riverfront property in Trenton, MI, with General Motors providing a $25 million loan. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html </ref> Purchasing war surplus equipment from an Indiana mill (at bargain prices), the first major construction program started soon afterward. The site was laid out and four sixty ton electric arc furnaces were installed. Soaking pits, a blooming mill, a [[Steckel mill]], a down-coiler and finishing equipment were installed. The first ingots were poured in 1949, and McLouth was soon established as a growing factor in the marketplace. \n\nA few years later, in 1954, the Trenton Plant was dedicated and McLouth Steel became able to produce iron as an integrated steel mill. Number One blast furnace was constructed with a capacity of 1250 tons a day. The three original 60 ton [[basic oxygen furnace]] (BOF) vessels were installed and McLouth became the first plant in the United States to make steel via the basic oxygen process. Adding to the melt shop were two 200 ton [[electric arc furnace]]s. The reversing Steckel mill was replaced by a six stand continuous {{convert|60|in|mm|adj=on}} hot strip rolling mill and a roughing stand was added to complement the blooming mill. More soaking pits were installed as well as a plant to supply the BOP with oxygen. Two pickle lines were added along with the slitters.\n\n1958 saw another major expansion of the plant. A new blast furnace was constructed (Number 2), two 110 ton BOP vessels, and the related support equipment for the BOP and blast furnaces also had their capacity increased. Gas cleaning systems were installed for the melt shop. Two Rust slab reheat furnaces were installed to handle stainless steel, as well as the massive grinder and slab unpilers. The grinders, unpilers, and the pusher/bumper units for the two furnaces were supplied by Composite Forgings, Inc.\n\nBetween 1960 and 1964, one more 110 ton BOP vessel was added, bringing the 110 ton vessel count to three. McLouth became the first company to use computer controls on a hot strip mill on November 1, 1962. Significantly, the first \"straight stick\" slab caster was installed during this period. It was the first in the United States.\n\nProfitable operations as well as market demand prompted a major commitment to build a [[Continuous Casting]] department in 1967 with the announcement of four curved mold continuous casting strands and six lines of three induction slab reheaters. Two additional 110 ton BOP vessels were also added to replace old and obsolete equipment (the 60 ton vessels). With these improvements to McLouth's steel making process, McLouth became the first steel mill to eventually produce 100% of its product by the continuous casting process, which added significantly to the efficiency of the operations and improved the quality of the finished product.\n\nThe plant was sold in 1996 to Detroit Steel Company. Up to the early 2000s, Detroit Steel primarily brought in outside steel, pickled it, and sold it. In the summer of 2009, after several failed start-up attempts, the Trenton complex had its electric distribution infrastructure removed. In 2017, the facility entered foreclosure after owners failed to pay $3.7 million in back taxes.<ref>{{cite web|title=County seizes former McLouth Steel plant after owners failed to pay $3.7M in back taxes|publisher=Jason Alley|url=https://www.thenewsherald.com/news/county-seizes-former-mclouth-steel-plant-after-owners-failed-to/article_b5510d12-195a-11e7-8405-47ebed33e539.html|accessdate=April 4, 2017}}</ref> In 2018, MSC Land Co. purchased the land, entering into an agreement to demolish all buildings and to perform some remediation. The proposed use for the land is an intermodal operation utilizing the port, rail lines, and proximity to freeways.  In May 2019, the site was put on EPA's Superfund National Priorities List <ref>https://www.crainsdetroit.com/real-estate/mclouth-steel-site-put-epas-superfund-national-priorities-list</ref>. The site is currently undergoing demolition.\n\n==Gibraltar Complex==\nIn 1954, McLouth announced the construction of a cold rolling facility in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]], close to the Trenton Plant. This facility has a four stand continuous cold rolling strip mill, annealing furnaces, two skin pass finishing mills and other ancillary equipment for further processing of cold rolled steel coils.\n\nThe property the company acquired was once owned by the Gibraltar Steel Corporation. The total area was around {{convert|900|acre|km2}} of land along the river bordering Trenton.  Original plans called for five additional blast furnaces dependent upon the completion of the All American Channel, a proposed channel through parts of Gibraltar. Without the channel, ore and coal haulers could not bring in the required raw materials. McLouth failed to get the proper financing to construct another integrated mill, so plans were drawn up for a stand-alone cold rolling mill.\n\nThere was a major fire that destroyed most of the pickling tower in 1970.\n\nThe plant was operated under Detroit Cold Rolling (a subsidiary of Detroit Steel) from 1996 (after the McLouth sale) until it was later sold to Steel Rolling Holdings in 2006. The plant was restarted by SRH, and was later purchased by Ferrolux. Ferrolux has since invested heavily into the Gibraltar facility.\n[[File:Oxygen-Process Steel-Making Vessel.jpg|thumb|One of three original BOP furnaces from the plant]]\n\n==Trenton Plant Assets==\n===Iron Making===\n* Two blast furnaces\n:Number 1 and number 2 furnaces were built in 1954 and 1958 respectively, by the Arthur McKee company.

McLouth Steel used a General Electric 312 computer for gauge control on the finishing train of a semi-continuous mill. The aim was to set up the initial roll gap and then establish correct gauge as soon as the head end of the strip emerged onto the runout table. The finishing train started running under continuous computer control on November 1, 1962.\n\n\"Probably the most exciting application of the GE 312 was to the hot strip mill of McLouth Steel Co. in Michigan. It was a difficult design inasmuch as each step in the process had to be varied on the basis of the measured values of the previous step. This required continuous high speed feedback to set the six different hot stands with absolute accuracy and reliability being essential; an error at one point could be magnified at the next, causing an entire process to go out of control. Fortunately, the GE 312 met the challenge.\" H. Oldfield, General Manager of the GE Computer Department.\n\nThe Solid State circuitry of a GE 312 computer was composed of 2500 diodes, 2500 transistors, and 12,000 resistors, but no magnetic core memory. There were 20 binary digits per word or per instruction. All arithmetic was fixed point. Numbers were 19 bits plus the associated positive or negative sign, not a very big number range when expressed in decimal form, just -524,287 to +524,287. The GE 312 was designed by A. Spielberg of the GE Computer Department that was newly formed in 1957.<ref>Ironmaking and Steelmaking 2004 VOL.31 No 6.</ref>\n\n===First Continuous Caster===\nMcLouth Steel was the first plant in North America to cast 100% of its steel by the continuous caster method.\n\nIn May 1962, McLouth personnel visited the Dillingen Steel Works in Germany, where continuously cast slabs larger than 100 square inches were first cast. Some sixteen months later, McLouth was operating a \"straight stick\" casting machine.\n\n====Pilot Plant====\nIn 1963, a full size single strand, vertical casting machine was added to the original Oxygen Process Shop. The machine was operated for five years, helping to pioneer techniques that would be useful when the larger four strand shop was constructed in 1968. The pilot shop was operated mostly during the day, while the afternoon and midnight shifts would repair, modify, or tune the machine.\n\nInitial slab sizes were 8\" x 36\", afterwards they began to cast bigger slabs by about 10\" increments up to 10\" x 52\". There was a noted improvement in quality, as with the ability to cast using larger molds. The pilot plant was limited to about 50 \"heats\" (ladles of molten steel), from the original OP shop. Over the course of operation, the pilot plant cast a little over 300,000 tons of steel.\n\nThe five year run of the plant produced the opportunity to help develop both the equipment and casting techniques. Extensive work was performed on the design of the molds and the casting speed relative to the slab quality.\n\n====Casting Plant Description====\nFour single-strand curved mold casting machines cast around 3000 tons per day. Only two casting machines would normally cast at one time, and many people questioned the need for four units. McLouth felt that the third caster was there for coordination reasons, while the fourth was a reserve for maintenance shutdowns. Ladles were moved by overhead bridge cranes to the casting machines, which could handle two at a time.\n\nThe record slab length for the plant was between May 9\u201311, 1972. The slab was 44\" wide and {{convert|9972|ft|m}} long, total weight was around 8,500 tons from 75 ladles. Strand two was used.\n<ref>McManus, George J. Slab Casting Pays Off, IronAge, November 30, 1972</ref>\n\n===First Use of Slab Induction Heating===\nMcLouth Steel's decision to cast unusually thick slabs (12&nbsp;inch) led them to reheat the slabs inductively. The whole setup was difficult to undertake, as well as uneconomical to use. The giant heaters resembled upside-down toasters, and made a loud buzzing sound when in operation.\n\nThe nature of the induction heating process is such that heat input to the slab is not restricted to the surface, but actually penetrates into the slab. The depth of penetration is determined by the frequency of the electrical power supply and the metallurgical makeup of the steel.\n\nAlthough induction heating was well established as an effective and economical process fulfilling many types of heating requirements, it had never been seriously considered for heating anything like the 12\" thick by 60\" wide by 26' long, 30 ton slabs McLouth wanted to produce. The fact that they wanted over 600 tons of steel heated per hour did nothing to help the situation.\n\nSeveral induction heating companies were contacted to determine if they would be interested in a project of this magnitude. Just one company expressed interest. Ajax Magnethermic from Warren, Ohio. Ajax informed McLouth that they had a new coil design which would be capable of doing the job. After discussions, McLouth entered into a shared cost, joint development venture with the company to design, build, and test a prototype coil system.\n\nEarly in 1965, several small 12\" thick slabs of [[rimmed steel]] were repetitively heated in a prototype 1,000&nbsp;kW rectangular coil. The tests proved that cold 12\" thick slabs could be heated to rolling temperature in less than one hour.\n\nThe next year, McLouth ordered 21 heaters (including three spares) as part of a $105 million program expected to be completed by the summer of 1968. The program expanded the hot metal facilities with a four strand caster and the new induction heaters. Production capacity at the plant was raised from 1,800,000 tons a year to 2,400,000.\n\nA full-size computer system was installed to automatically switch heaters on or off as required to rebalance the phase loading and to remove the threat of a 120 KV line outage. [[Detroit Edison]] permitted McLouth a maximum phase imbalance of 43 MW. The computer shut off heaters if a limit was reached and provided printouts of hourly demands, alarms, engineering logs, as well as maintenance logs.\n\nOverall, the system was a novel idea, but really only worked on paper. Auto transformer failures were frequent, as were bus connection failures. When all 18 heaters were running at full capacity, McLouth Steel was Michigan's second largest consumer of electricity (first was the city of [[Detroit]]). The environmental impact was very low due to a closed water cooling system and heaters being shut off during non-operating hours.\n<ref>Induction Heating of Slabs at McLouth Steel. Ronald H. Craig - Chief Electrical Engineer</ref>\n\n== Closing ==\nMcLouth Steel's demise can be attributed to a mixture of causes.\n\nMcLouth only produced flat-rolled steel, with 75% of its customers being automotive. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html</ref> Its attempts to diversify, including purchase of trucking/coke/ore companies, did not generate the revenue or savings projected. Multiple recessions, cheap overseas steel, and lessened steel use in cars and trucks also harmed the company. \n\nMcLouth was \"top-heavy\" with a ratio of 1 supervisor to every 4 workers, while the union desired 1 supervisor to every 15 workers. <ref> Working Detroit, Steve Babson </ref> McLouth had an extremely generous wage package, something the union was cooperative about reducing in later years as the need to cut costs increased. \n\nIn the spirit of its old slogan, \"Pioneers in Steel Technology\", McLouth often led the way in implementation of new processes while other steelmakers capitalized on McLouth absorbing those costs. Competitors then optimized the process, outdoing McLouth's production/efficiency. <ref>https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/47501/entryintoexitfro00tang.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref> Aging and incorrectly-sized equipment paired with low employee morale/productivity in the 1980s/90s subsequently lowered the quality of steel, creating reputation problems.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Steel companies of the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox company\n| name          = McLouth Steel Corporation\n| logo          = [[image:McLouth Steel Logo.svg|200px]]\n| fate          = Bankruptcy\n| successor     = Detroit Steel Company\n| foundation    = 1934\n| defunct       = 1996\n| location      = [[Detroit, MI]] 1934-1981, [[Trenton, MI]] 1982-1996\n| industry      = [[Steel]]\n| key_people    = Donald B.

The company was once the ninth largest steelmaker in the country, and had three locations. The first plant was in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the second (and significantly larger) in [[Trenton, Michigan]], and the third, a cold mill, in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]]. The Detroit plant was last owned by Jones & Laughlin Steel Company and has been demolished. The Trenton facility is owned by MSC Land Co. and has also been demolished. The Gibraltar cold mill is owned by Ferrolux, and has been restarted.\n\n==Detroit Complex==\nThis complex was built in 1934 by Donald B. McLouth, a Detroit scrap dealer,  as a small conversion mill on Livernois Avenue in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan|MI]]. Desiring additional options for steel, partial financing was provided by [[General Motors]]. In its later years, the plant was revamped to produce only stainless steel, eventually being bought by [[Jones and Laughlin Steel Company]] in 1981.\n\nThe Detroit mill initially consisted of a small reversing hot rolling strip mill with a slab heating furnace. The original hot strip mill was known as the \"Coffee Grinder\" from the sounds the mill would make. In 1938, the company brought online a single 4-high reversing cold reducing mill with ancillary facilities (annealing and finishing). Throughout the next few years, modifications were made to the equipment and eventually, the company had the capacity to roll 108,000 net tons per year of hot rolled products and 60,000 net tons of cold rolled steel products.\n\nIn 1947, McLouth Steel began rolling stainless steel. Two single stand reversing cold reducing mills were installed with the related supplementary equipment. In 1954, $6,000,000 of the $100,000,000 expansion plan for the new Trenton plant was used to install two 4-high reversing cold rolling mills. With this new addition to the Detroit plant, the stainless steel production increased to 52,000 net tons per year.\n\nThe Detroit plant was a finishing facility for sheet and strip products only. Principal operating units were two {{convert|50|in|mm|adj=on}}., 4-high cold reduction mills, a cold [[Annealing (metallurgy)|anneal]] and pickle line, a [[temper mill]], two slitting lines(36in. and 24in.), and a coil polisher. The two 50in. reduction mills were essentially identical. Both were installed in 1953 by United and had a combined annual capacity of 120,000 tons. The cold anneal and pickle line were installed in 1975 by Production Machinery. The line consisted of an entry end washing section to remove rolling oils, an open air annealing furnace (where the strip was heated above {{convert|1900|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}), and three acid pickling tanks followed by rinsing and drying units. Paper was interleaved between the coil wraps at the exit take up reel to avoid surface abrasion.\n\nCoil product was usually shipped from the Detroit plant via truck.\n\nThe Detroit plant was demolished in 2018.\n\n==Trenton Complex==\n[[File:Actual Trenton Plant.jpg|thumb|A photograph showing the majority of the Trenton, MI plant.]]\nIn 1948, McLouth Steel started its $100 million expansion program by purchasing riverfront property in Trenton, MI, with General Motors providing a $25 million loan. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html </ref> Purchasing war surplus equipment from an Indiana mill (at bargain prices), the first major construction program started soon afterward. The site was laid out and four sixty ton electric arc furnaces were installed. Soaking pits, a blooming mill, a [[Steckel mill]], a down-coiler and finishing equipment were installed. The first ingots were poured in 1949, and McLouth was soon established as a growing factor in the marketplace. \n\nA few years later, in 1954, the Trenton Plant was dedicated and McLouth Steel became able to produce iron as an integrated steel mill. Number One blast furnace was constructed with a capacity of 1250 tons a day. The three original 60 ton [[basic oxygen furnace]] (BOF) vessels were installed and McLouth became the first plant in the United States to make steel via the basic oxygen process. Adding to the melt shop were two 200 ton [[electric arc furnace]]s. The reversing Steckel mill was replaced by a six stand continuous {{convert|60|in|mm|adj=on}} hot strip rolling mill and a roughing stand was added to complement the blooming mill. More soaking pits were installed as well as a plant to supply the BOP with oxygen. Two pickle lines were added along with the slitters.\n\n1958 saw another major expansion of the plant. A new blast furnace was constructed (Number 2), two 110 ton BOP vessels, and the related support equipment for the BOP and blast furnaces also had their capacity increased. Gas cleaning systems were installed for the melt shop. Two Rust slab reheat furnaces were installed to handle stainless steel, as well as the massive grinder and slab unpilers. The grinders, unpilers, and the pusher/bumper units for the two furnaces were supplied by Composite Forgings, Inc.\n\nBetween 1960 and 1964, one more 110 ton BOP vessel was added, bringing the 110 ton vessel count to three. McLouth became the first company to use computer controls on a hot strip mill on November 1, 1962. Significantly, the first \"straight stick\" slab caster was installed during this period. It was the first in the United States.\n\nProfitable operations as well as market demand prompted a major commitment to build a [[Continuous Casting]] department in 1967 with the announcement of four curved mold continuous casting strands and six lines of three induction slab reheaters. Two additional 110 ton BOP vessels were also added to replace old and obsolete equipment (the 60 ton vessels). With these improvements to McLouth's steel making process, McLouth became the first steel mill to eventually produce 100% of its product by the continuous casting process, which added significantly to the efficiency of the operations and improved the quality of the finished product.\n\nThe plant was sold in 1996 to Detroit Steel Company. Up to the early 2000s, Detroit Steel primarily brought in outside steel, pickled it, and sold it. In the summer of 2009, after several failed start-up attempts, the Trenton complex had its electric distribution infrastructure removed. In 2017, the facility entered foreclosure after owners failed to pay $3.7 million in back taxes.<ref>{{cite web|title=County seizes former McLouth Steel plant after owners failed to pay $3.7M in back taxes|publisher=Jason Alley|url=https://www.thenewsherald.com/news/county-seizes-former-mclouth-steel-plant-after-owners-failed-to/article_b5510d12-195a-11e7-8405-47ebed33e539.html|accessdate=April 4, 2017}}</ref> In 2018, MSC Land Co. purchased the land, entering into an agreement to demolish all buildings and to perform some remediation. The proposed use for the land is an intermodal operation utilizing the port, rail lines, and proximity to freeways.  In May 2019, the site was put on EPA's Superfund National Priorities List <ref>https://www.crainsdetroit.com/real-estate/mclouth-steel-site-put-epas-superfund-national-priorities-list</ref>. The site is currently undergoing demolition.\n\n==Gibraltar Complex==\nIn 1954, McLouth announced the construction of a cold rolling facility in [[Gibraltar, Michigan]], close to the Trenton Plant. This facility has a four stand continuous cold rolling strip mill, annealing furnaces, two skin pass finishing mills and other ancillary equipment for further processing of cold rolled steel coils.\n\nThe property the company acquired was once owned by the Gibraltar Steel Corporation. The total area was around {{convert|900|acre|km2}} of land along the river bordering Trenton.  Original plans called for five additional blast furnaces dependent upon the completion of the All American Channel, a proposed channel through parts of Gibraltar. Without the channel, ore and coal haulers could not bring in the required raw materials. McLouth failed to get the proper financing to construct another integrated mill, so plans were drawn up for a stand-alone cold rolling mill.\n\nThere was a major fire that destroyed most of the pickling tower in 1970.\n\nThe plant was operated under Detroit Cold Rolling (a subsidiary of Detroit Steel) from 1996 (after the McLouth sale) until it was later sold to Steel Rolling Holdings in 2006. The plant was restarted by SRH, and was later purchased by Ferrolux. Ferrolux has since invested heavily into the Gibraltar facility.\n[[File:Oxygen-Process Steel-Making Vessel.jpg|thumb|One of three original BOP furnaces from the plant]]\n\n==Trenton Plant Assets==\n===Iron Making===\n* Two blast furnaces\n:Number 1 and number 2 furnaces were built in 1954 and 1958 respectively, by the Arthur McKee company.

McLouth Steel used a General Electric 312 computer for gauge control on the finishing train of a semi-continuous mill. The aim was to set up the initial roll gap and then establish correct gauge as soon as the head end of the strip emerged onto the runout table. The finishing train started running under continuous computer control on November 1, 1962.\n\n\"Probably the most exciting application of the GE 312 was to the hot strip mill of McLouth Steel Co. in Michigan. It was a difficult design inasmuch as each step in the process had to be varied on the basis of the measured values of the previous step. This required continuous high speed feedback to set the six different hot stands with absolute accuracy and reliability being essential; an error at one point could be magnified at the next, causing an entire process to go out of control. Fortunately, the GE 312 met the challenge.\" H. Oldfield, General Manager of the GE Computer Department.\n\nThe Solid State circuitry of a GE 312 computer was composed of 2500 diodes, 2500 transistors, and 12,000 resistors, but no magnetic core memory. There were 20 binary digits per word or per instruction. All arithmetic was fixed point. Numbers were 19 bits plus the associated positive or negative sign, not a very big number range when expressed in decimal form, just -524,287 to +524,287. The GE 312 was designed by A. Spielberg of the GE Computer Department that was newly formed in 1957.<ref>Ironmaking and Steelmaking 2004 VOL.31 No 6.</ref>\n\n===First Continuous Caster===\nMcLouth Steel was the first plant in North America to cast 100% of its steel by the continuous caster method.\n\nIn May 1962, McLouth personnel visited the Dillingen Steel Works in Germany, where continuously cast slabs larger than 100 square inches were first cast. Some sixteen months later, McLouth was operating a \"straight stick\" casting machine.\n\n====Pilot Plant====\nIn 1963, a full size single strand, vertical casting machine was added to the original Oxygen Process Shop. The machine was operated for five years, helping to pioneer techniques that would be useful when the larger four strand shop was constructed in 1968. The pilot shop was operated mostly during the day, while the afternoon and midnight shifts would repair, modify, or tune the machine.\n\nInitial slab sizes were 8\" x 36\", afterwards they began to cast bigger slabs by about 10\" increments up to 10\" x 52\". There was a noted improvement in quality, as with the ability to cast using larger molds. The pilot plant was limited to about 50 \"heats\" (ladles of molten steel), from the original OP shop. Over the course of operation, the pilot plant cast a little over 300,000 tons of steel.\n\nThe five year run of the plant produced the opportunity to help develop both the equipment and casting techniques. Extensive work was performed on the design of the molds and the casting speed relative to the slab quality.\n\n====Casting Plant Description====\nFour single-strand curved mold casting machines cast around 3000 tons per day. Only two casting machines would normally cast at one time, and many people questioned the need for four units. McLouth felt that the third caster was there for coordination reasons, while the fourth was a reserve for maintenance shutdowns. Ladles were moved by overhead bridge cranes to the casting machines, which could handle two at a time.\n\nThe record slab length for the plant was between May 9\u201311, 1972. The slab was 44\" wide and {{convert|9972|ft|m}} long, total weight was around 8,500 tons from 75 ladles. Strand two was used.\n<ref>McManus, George J. Slab Casting Pays Off, IronAge, November 30, 1972</ref>\n\n===First Use of Slab Induction Heating===\nMcLouth Steel's decision to cast unusually thick slabs (12&nbsp;inch) led them to reheat the slabs inductively. The whole setup was difficult to undertake, as well as uneconomical to use. The giant heaters resembled upside-down toasters, and made a loud buzzing sound when in operation.\n\nThe nature of the induction heating process is such that heat input to the slab is not restricted to the surface, but actually penetrates into the slab. The depth of penetration is determined by the frequency of the electrical power supply and the metallurgical makeup of the steel.\n\nAlthough induction heating was well established as an effective and economical process fulfilling many types of heating requirements, it had never been seriously considered for heating anything like the 12\" thick by 60\" wide by 26' long, 30 ton slabs McLouth wanted to produce. The fact that they wanted over 600 tons of steel heated per hour did nothing to help the situation.\n\nSeveral induction heating companies were contacted to determine if they would be interested in a project of this magnitude. Just one company expressed interest. Ajax Magnethermic from Warren, Ohio. Ajax informed McLouth that they had a new coil design which would be capable of doing the job. After discussions, McLouth entered into a shared cost, joint development venture with the company to design, build, and test a prototype coil system.\n\nEarly in 1965, several small 12\" thick slabs of [[rimmed steel]] were repetitively heated in a prototype 1,000&nbsp;kW rectangular coil. The tests proved that cold 12\" thick slabs could be heated to rolling temperature in less than one hour.\n\nThe next year, McLouth ordered 21 heaters (including three spares) as part of a $105 million program expected to be completed by the summer of 1968. The program expanded the hot metal facilities with a four strand caster and the new induction heaters. Production capacity at the plant was raised from 1,800,000 tons a year to 2,400,000.\n\nA full-size computer system was installed to automatically switch heaters on or off as required to rebalance the phase loading and to remove the threat of a 120 KV line outage. [[Detroit Edison]] permitted McLouth a maximum phase imbalance of 43 MW. The computer shut off heaters if a limit was reached and provided printouts of hourly demands, alarms, engineering logs, as well as maintenance logs.\n\nOverall, the system was a novel idea, but really only worked on paper. Auto transformer failures were frequent, as were bus connection failures. When all 18 heaters were running at full capacity, McLouth Steel was Michigan's second largest consumer of electricity (first was the city of [[Detroit]]). The environmental impact was very low due to a closed water cooling system and heaters being shut off during non-operating hours.\n<ref>Induction Heating of Slabs at McLouth Steel. Ronald H. Craig - Chief Electrical Engineer</ref>\n\n== Closing ==\nMcLouth Steel's demise can be attributed to a mixture of causes.\n\nMcLouth only produced flat-rolled steel, with 75% of its customers being automotive. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/02/business/a-steel-company-fights-for-its-life.html</ref> Its attempts to diversify, including purchase of trucking/coke/ore companies, did not generate the revenue or savings projected. Multiple recessions, cheap overseas steel, and lessened steel use in cars and trucks also harmed the company. \n\nMcLouth was \"top-heavy\" with a ratio of 1 supervisor to every 4 workers, while the union desired 1 supervisor to every 15 workers. <ref> Working Detroit, Steve Babson </ref> McLouth had an extremely generous wage package, something the union was cooperative about reducing in later years as the need to cut costs increased. \n\nIn the spirit of its old slogan, \"Pioneers in Steel Technology\", McLouth often led the way in implementation of new processes while other steelmakers capitalized on McLouth absorbing those costs. Competitors then optimized the process, outdoing McLouth's production/efficiency. <ref>https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/47501/entryintoexitfro00tang.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref> Aging and incorrectly-sized equipment paired with low employee morale/productivity in the 1980s/90s subsequently lowered the quality of steel, creating reputation problems.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Steel companies of the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Ty5150", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLegacy and Achievements", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLouth_Steel"}

There are many names for these overall buildings, see below. The [[housing tenure]] of apartments also varies considerably, from large-scale [[public housing]], to [[owner occupancy]] within what is legally a [[condominium]] ([[strata title]] or [[commonhold]]), to tenants renting from a private landlord (see [[leasehold estate]]).\n\n==Terminology==\n===\"Flat\" vs \"apartment\"===\nBoth words refer to a self-contained residential unit with its own front door, kitchen, toilet, and [[bathroom]]. In some parts of the world, the word ''apartment'' refers to a purpose-built unit in a building, whereas the word ''flat'' means a converted unit in an older building, usually a big house.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} In other places the terms are interchangeable.\n\nThe term ''apartment'' is favored in North America (although in some cities ''flat'' is used for a unit which is part of a house containing two or three units, typically one to a floor<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lexico.com/definition/apartment|title=Apartment {{!}} Meaning of Apartment by Lexico|website=Lexico Dictionaries {{!}} English|language=en|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}). In the UK, the term  ''apartment'' is more usual in professional [[real estate]] and [[architectural]] circles where otherwise the term ''flat'' is used commonly, but not exclusively, for an apartment on a single level (hence a 'flat' apartment).\n\nIn some countries, the word \"[[Unit (housing)|unit]]\" is a more general term referring to both apartments and rental business [[Suite (address)|suite]]s. The word 'unit' is generally used only in the context of a specific building; e.g., \"This building has three units\" or \"I'm going to rent a unit in this building\", but not \"I'm going to rent a unit somewhere\".\n\nSome buildings can be characterized as 'mixed-use buildings', meaning part of the building is for commercial, business, or office use, usually on the first floor or first couple of floors, and one or more apartments are found in the rest of the building, usually on the upper floors.\n\n===By housing tenure===\n[[File:St James Town1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Low-income housing]] of the [[St. James Town]] neighborhood in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada]]\n[[File:Cove, Punggol Field.JPG|thumb|right|[[Housing Development Board]] flats in [[Punggol]], [[Singapore]] ]]\n\n([[Condominium]], [[public housing]], [[owner-occupancy]], etc.)\n\n[[Tenement (law)|Tenement law]] refers to the [[feudalism|feudal]] basis of permanent property such as land or rents. It may be found combined as in \"[[Messuage]] or Tenement\" to encompass all the land, buildings and other assets of a property.\n\nIn the United States, some apartment-dwellers own their units, either as a [[housing cooperative]], in which the residents own shares of a corporation that owns the building or development; or in a [[condominium]], whose residents own their apartments and share ownership of the public spaces. Most apartments are in buildings designed for the purpose, but large older [[house]]s are sometimes divided into apartments. The word ''apartment'' denotes a residential unit or section in a building. In some locations, particularly the United States, the word connotes a rental unit owned by the building owner, and is not typically used for a condominium.\n\nIn England and Wales, some flat owners own shares in the company that owns the [[Fee simple|freehold]] of the building as well as holding the flat under a lease.  This arrangement is commonly known as a \"share of freehold\" flat. The freehold company has the right to collect annual ground rents from each of the flat owners in the building. The freeholder can also develop or sell the building, subject to the usual planning and restrictions that might apply. This situation does not happen in Scotland, where long leasehold of residential property was formerly unusual, and is now impossible.<ref>{{cite web| title=Long Leases (Scotland) Act 2012| website=UK Legislation| date=2012| url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2012/9/contents/enacted | accessdate=9 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===By size of the unit===\nBachelor apartment, one-[[bedroom]], etc.; see below.\n\n===By size of the building===\n[[File:English Bay Vancouver.jpg|thumb|right|[[High-rise building]]s in the [[English Bay (Vancouver)|English Bay]] area of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada]]\n[[File:Fatima 0549 (19531851070).jpg|thumb|left|A [[low-rise building]] of flats above shops in [[F\u00e1tima, Portugal]]]]\n\nApartment buildings are [[multi-story]] buildings where three or more residences are contained within one structure. Such a building may be called an ''apartment building'', ''apartment complex'', ''flat complex'', ''block of flats'', ''tower block'', ''high-rise'' or, occasionally, ''mansion block'' (in British English), especially if it consists of many apartments for rent. A high-rise apartment building is commonly referred to as a ''residential tower'', ''apartment tower'', or ''block of flats'' in Australia.\n\nA [[high-rise building]] is defined by its height differently in various [[jurisdiction]]s. It may be only residential, in which case it might also be called a tower block, or it might include other functions such as hotel, offices, or shops. There is no clear difference between a tower block and a [[skyscraper]], although a building with fifty or more stories is generally considered a skyscraper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/547956/skyscraper|title=skyscraper|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc|accessdate=19 September 2012}}</ref> High-rise buildings became possible with the invention of the [[elevator]] (lift) and cheaper, more abundant building materials. Their [[structural system]] usually is made of [[reinforced concrete]] and [[steel]].\n\nA [[low-rise building]] and mid-rise buildings have fewer storeys, but the limits are not always clear. [[Emporis]] defines a low-rise as \"an enclosed structure below 35 metres [115 feet] which is divided into regular floor levels.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://standards.emporis.com/?nav=realestate&lng=3&esn=49213 |title=Data Standards: Structures - low-rise building |publisher=Emporis Standards |accessdate=10 June 2009}}</ref> The city of [[Toronto]] defines a mid-rise as a building between 4 and 12 stories.<ref>http://faculty.geog.utoronto.ca/Hess/Courses/studio/presentation%20on%20avenues%20and%20mid-rise%20study.pdf</ref>\n\n===By country===\nIn [[American English]], the distinction between rental apartments and [[condominium]]s is that while rental buildings are owned by a single entity and rented out to many, condominiums are owned individually, while their owners still pay a monthly or yearly fee for building upkeep. Condominiums are often leased by their owner as rental apartments. A third alternative, the [[Housing cooperative|cooperative apartment]] building (or \"co-op\"), acts as a corporation with all of the tenants as shareholders of the building. Tenants in cooperative buildings do not own their apartment, but instead own a proportional number of shares of the entire cooperative. As in condominiums, cooperators pay a monthly fee for building upkeep. Co-ops are common in cities such as New York, and have gained some popularity in other larger urban areas in the U.S.\n\nIn [[British English]] the usual word is \"flat\", but ''apartment'' is used by property developers to denote expensive 'flats' in exclusive and expensive residential areas in, for example, parts of London such as [[Belgravia]] and [[Hampstead]]. In Scotland, it is called a block of flats or, if it is a traditional sandstone building, a ''[[tenement]]'', a term which has a negative connotation elsewhere.\n\nIn India, the word flat is used to refer to multi-storey dwellings that have lifts.<ref>[https://www.magicbricks.com/flats-in-new-delhi-for-sale-pppfs]</ref>\n\n[[Australian English]] and [[New Zealand English]] traditionally used the term ''flat'' (although it also applies to any rental property), and more recently also use the terms ''unit'' or ''apartment''. In Australia, a 'unit' refers to flats, apartments or even [[semi-detached]] houses. In Australia, the terms \"unit\", \"flat\" and \"apartment\" are largely used interchangeably. Newer high-rise buildings are more often marketed as \"apartments\", as the term \"flats\" carries colloquial connotations. The term condominium or condo is rarely used in Australia despite attempts by developers to market it.\n\nIn [[South African English]], an apartment is usually a single level rental area that is a part of a larger building and can be entered from inside the building through a separate door leading off either a wind tunnel or entrance hall/lobby that is shared with other occupants of the building.\n\nIn [[Malaysian English]], ''flat'' often denotes a housing block of two rooms with walk-up, no lift, without facilities, typically five storeys tall, and with outdoor parking space,<ref>[https://www.propsocial.my/topic/226/categories-of-homes-in-malaysia-posted-by-propsocial-editor?all=1 Categories of Homes in Malaysia.]</ref> while ''apartment'' is more generic and may also include luxury condominiums.\n\nIn Japanese English [[loanword]]s (''[[Wasei-eigo]]''), the term ''apartment'' (''apaato'') is used for lower-income housing and ''mansion'' (''manshon'') is used for high-end apartments; but both terms refer to what English-speakers regard as an apartment (or condominium) and not the level of luxury of a [[mansion]] in English parlance. See [[Housing in Japan]]. ''[[Danchi]]'' is the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word for a large cluster of apartment buildings of a particular style and design, typically built as [[public housing]] by government authorities.\n\n==Types and characteristics==\n===Studio apartment===\n[[File:Cuisinette studio in Sherbrooke April 2010.jpg|thumb|Studio apartment in [[Sherbrooke, Quebec]], Canada, showing double bed, kitchenette, and entrance way with sliding door to closet]]\n{{Main|Studio apartment}}\n{{See also|Microapartment}}\nThe smallest self-contained apartments are referred to as studio, efficiency or bachelor apartments in the US, or studio flat in the UK. These units usually consist of a large single main room which acts as the living room, dining room and bedroom combined and usually also includes kitchen facilities, with a separate bathroom.

Such a garden apartment shares some characteristics of a [[townhouse]]: each apartment has its own building entrance, or shares that entrance via a staircase and lobby that adjoins other units immediately above and/or below it. Unlike a townhouse, each apartment occupies only one level. Such garden apartment buildings are almost never more than three stories high, since they typically lack [[elevator]]s. However, the first \"garden apartment\" buildings in New York, USA, built in the early 1900s, were constructed five stories high.<ref>[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/garden_apartments/ New York City Garden Apartments] retrieved 17 October 2009</ref><ref>Hogan, Meghan.

The large [[townhouse (Great Britain)|Georgian or Victorian townhouse]] was built with an excavated subterranean space around its front known as [[Area (architecture)|an area]], often surrounded by cast iron railings. This lowest floor housed the kitchen, the main place of work for the servants, with a \"tradesman's entrance\" via the area stairs. This \"lower ground floor\" (another euphemism) has proven ideal for conversion to a self-contained \"garden flat\". One American term for this arrangement is an [[English basement]].\n\n===Basement apartment===\n{{Main|Basement apartment}}\nGenerally on the lowest floor of a building.\n\n===Secondary suite===\n{{Main|Secondary suite}}\nWhen part of a house is converted for the ostensible use of the owner's family member, the self-contained dwelling may be known as an \"in-law apartment\", \"annexe\", or \"granny flat\", though these (sometimes illegally) created units are often occupied by ordinary renters rather than the landlord's relative. In Canada these are commonly located below the main house and are therefore \"basement suites\".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Another term is an \"accessory dwelling unit\", which may be part of the main house, or a free-standing structure in its grounds.\n\n===Salon apartment===\n''Salon apartment'' is a term linked to the exclusive apartments built as part of multi-family houses in [[Belgrade]] and in certain towns in [[Yugoslavia]] in the first decades of the 20th century.<ref>Alfirevi\u0107 \u0110or\u0111e, Simonovi\u0107 Alfirevi\u0107 San\u0458a.

This is a very common arrangement in much post-War British public housing, serving both to reduce costs by reducing the amount of space given to access corridors and to emulate the 'traditional' two-storey terrace house to which many of the residents would have been accustomed.\n\nA maisonette could encompass [[Tyneside flat]]s, pairs of single-storey flats within a two-storey [[terraced house|terrace]].

Some [[public housing in the United Kingdom]] was designed as [[scissor section flat]]s. On a grander level, [[penthouse apartment|penthouses]] may have more than one storey, to emphasise the idea of space and luxury.\n\nTwo storey units in new construction are sometimes referred to as \"[[townhouse]]s\".\n\n===Small buildings with a few one-storey dwellings===\n[[File:CambridgeTripleDecker.jpg|thumb|A triple-decker in New England.]]\n[[File:Dingbat MaryJane.jpg|thumb|left|Dingbat MaryJane]]\n\n\"[[Duplex (building)|Duplex]]\" refers to two separate units with a [[party wall|common demising wall]] or floor-ceiling assembly.\n\nDuplex description can be different depending on the part of the US, but generally has two to four dwellings with a door for each and usually two front doors close together but separate - referred to as '[[Duplex (building)|duplex]]' indicating the number of units, not the number of floors, as in some areas of the country they are often only one story. The term duplex is largely unknown in the UK; there, buildings containing two dwellings with a common vertical wall are known as ''semi-detached'' or just ''a semi'' (the i pronounced \"ee\" not \"eye\"), but the dwellings are usually two storeys (excluding any use of the roof space). This form of construction is very common, and built as such rather than a later conversion.\n\nIn the United States, regional forms have developed, see [[vernacular architecture]]. In [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], a [[Polish flat]] or \"raised cottage\" is an existing small house that has been lifted up to accommodate the creation of a basement floor housing a separate apartment, then set down again, thus becoming a modest pair of dwellings.<ref>{{cite book|editor-first=Sally |editor-last=McMurray |title=People, Power, Places|date=2000|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=9781572330757|page=40|edition=1st}}</ref> In the [[Sun Belt]], boxy small apartment buildings called [[Dingbat (building)|dingbats]], often with [[carport]]s below, sprang up from the 1950s.\n\nGroups of more than two units have corresponding names (Triplex, etc.).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Those buildings that have a third storey are known as triplexes. See [[Three-decker (house)]]. Again, the term triplex is virtually unknown in the UK.\n\n===Loft apartment===\n[[File:400SGreenLoft.jpg|thumb|The interior of a loft conversion in Chicago]]\n{{Main|Loft#Loft_apartment}}\nThis type of apartment developed in North America during the middle of the 20th century. The term initially described a living space created within a former industrial building, usually 19th century. These large apartments found favor with artists and musicians wanting accommodation in large cities (New York for example) and is related to unused buildings in the decaying parts of such cities being occupied illegally by people [[squatting]].\n\nThese loft apartments were usually located in former highrise warehouses and factories left vacant after town planning rules and economic conditions in the mid 20th century changed. The resulting apartments created a new bohemian lifestyle and are arranged in a completely different way from most urban living spaces, often including workshops and art studio spaces. As the supply of old buildings of a suitable nature has dried up, developers have responded by constructing new buildings in the same aesthetic with varying degrees of success.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nAn industrial, warehouse, or commercial space converted to an apartment is commonly called a ''[[loft]]'', although some modern lofts are built by design.\n\n===Penthouse===\n{{Main|Penthouse apartment}}\nAn apartment located on the top floor of a high-rise apartment building.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Communal apartment===\n{{Main|Communal apartment}}\nIn [[Russia]], a communal apartment (\u00ab\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0443\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0430\u00bb) is a room with a shared kitchen and bath. A typical arrangement is a cluster of five or so room-apartments with a common kitchen and bathroom and separate front doors, occupying a floor in a pre-Revolutionary mansion. Traditionally a room is owned by the government and assigned to a family on a semi-permanent basis.<ref>{{cite web|title=Naherholung gleich ums Eck|url=http://www.terrafinanz.de/brenner-park-sendling|publisher=terrafinanz.de|accessdate=17 June 2013|language=German}}</ref>\n\n===Serviced apartment===\n[[File:PAJASA Service Apartment Mumbai.jpg|thumb|Serviced apartment, Mumbai, India]]\n{{Main|Serviced apartment}}\n{{See also|Apartment hotel|Corporate housing}}\nA \"serviced apartment\" is any size space for residential living which includes regular maid and cleaning services provided by the rental agent. Serviced apartments or serviced flats developed in the early part of the 20th century and were briefly fashionable in the 1920s and 30s. They are intended to combine the best features of luxury and self-contained apartments, often being an adjunct of a [[hotel]]. Like guests semi-permanently installed in a luxury hotel, residents could enjoy the additional facilities such as house keeping, laundry, catering and other services if and when desired.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nA feature of these apartment blocks was quite glamorous interiors with lavish bathrooms but no kitchen or laundry spaces in each flat. This style of living became very fashionable as many upper-class people found they could not afford as many live-in staff after the First World War and revelled in a \"lock-up and leave\" life style that serviced apartment hotels supplied. Some buildings have been subsequently renovated with standard facilities in each apartment, but serviced apartment hotel complexes continue to be constructed. Recently a number of hotels have supplemented their traditional business model with serviced apartment wings, creating privately owned areas within their buildings - either [[freehold (law)|freehold]] or [[leasehold]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Facilities===\n[[File:Laundry Room.jpg|thumb|Laundry Room]]\nApartments may be available for rent furnished, with furniture, or unfurnished into which a tenant moves in with their own furniture. [[Serviced apartment]]s, intended to be convenient for shorter stays, include soft furnishings and [[List of food preparation utensils|kitchen utensils]], and [[maid service]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n[[Laundry#Shared_laundry_rooms|Laundry facilities]] may reside in a common area accessible to all building tenants, or each apartment may have its own facilities. Depending on when the building was built and its design, utilities such as water, heating, and electricity may be common for all of the apartments, or separate for each apartment and billed separately to each tenant. (Many areas in the US have ruled it illegal to split a water bill among all the tenants, especially if a pool is on the premises.) Outlets for connection to telephones are typically included in apartments. Telephone service is optional and is almost always billed separately from the rent payments. Cable television and similar amenities also cost extra. Parking space(s), air conditioning, and extra storage space may or may not be included with an apartment. Rental [[Rental agreement|lease]]s often limit the maximum number of residents in each apartment.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nOn or around the ground floor of the apartment building, a series of [[Letter box|mailbox]]es are typically kept in a location accessible to the public and, thus, to the [[mail carrier]]. Every unit typically gets its own mailbox with individual keys to it. Some very large apartment buildings with a full-time staff may take mail from the carrier and provide mail-sorting service. Near the mailboxes or some other location accessible by outsiders, a buzzer (equivalent to a doorbell) may be available for each individual unit. In smaller apartment buildings such as two- or three-flats, or even four-flats, rubbish is often disposed of in trash containers similar to those used at houses. In larger buildings, rubbish is often collected in a common trash bin or dumpster. For cleanliness or minimizing noise, many lessors will place restrictions on tenants regarding smoking or keeping pets in an apartment.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Various===\n[[File:One-by-five Apartments Austin, TX.jpg|thumb|Mid-rise [[One-plus-five]] style apartment buildings in [[Austin, Texas]].]]\nIn more urban areas, apartments close to the [[downtown]] area have the benefits of proximity to jobs and/or [[public transportation]]. However, prices per square foot are often much higher than in suburban areas.\n\nMoving up from studio flats are one-bedroom apartments, in which a bedroom is separate from the rest of the apartment, followed by two-bedroom, three-bedroom, etc. apartments. (Apartments with more than three bedrooms are rare.)\n\nSmall apartments often have only one entrance.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Large apartments often have two entrances, perhaps a door in the front and another in the back, or from an underground or otherwise attached parking structure. Depending on the building design, the entrance doors may be connected directly to the outside or to a common area inside, such as a hallway or a lobby.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nIn many American cities, the [[One-plus-five]] style of mid-rise, wood-framed apartments have gained significant popularity following a 2009 revision to the [[International Building Code]]; these buildings typically feature four wood-framed floors above a concrete podium and are popular with developers due to their high density and relatively lower construction costs.<ref name=\"Curbed\">{{cite web |url=https://www.curbed.com/2018/12/4/18125536/real-estate-modern-apartment-architecture |title=Why do all new apartment buildings look the same? |author=Sissom, Patrick |work=Curbed |date=4 December 2018 |accessdate=23 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Historical examples==\n\n===Pre-Columbian Americas===\nThe [[Puebloan peoples]] of what is now the Southwestern United States have constructed large, multi-room dwellings, some comprising more than 900 rooms, since the 10th century.\n\nIn the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic Period]] [[Mesoamerica]]n city of [[Teotihuacan]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jarus|first1=Owen|title=Teotihuacan: Ancient City of Pyramids|url=http://www.livescience.com/22545-teotihuacan.html|website=Livescience|publisher=Livescience|accessdate=19 March 2016}}</ref> apartments were not only the standard means of housing the city's population of over 200,000 inhabitants, but show a remarkably even wealth distribution for the entire city, even by contemporary standards.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Michael E.|title=Living the good life in Teotihuacan|url=http://wideurbanworld.blogspot.com/2014/10/living-good-life-in-teotihuacan.html|accessdate=19 March 2016|ref=http://wideurbanworld.blogspot.com/2014/10/living-good-life-in-teotihuacan.html}}</ref> Furthermore, the apartments were inhabited by the general populace as a whole,<ref>{{cite web|title=Teotihuacan|url=http://mexicanhistory.org/Teotihuacan.htm|website=Mexican History|accessdate=19 March 2016}}</ref> in contrast to other Pre-Modern socieites, where apartments were limited to housing the lower class members of the society, as with the somewhat contemporary Roman [[insulae]].\n\n===Ancient Rome===\n[[File:OstianInsula.JPG|thumb|Remains of an Ancient Roman apartment block from the early 2nd century AD in [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]]]]\nIn [[ancient Rome]], the [[insulae]] (singular ''insula'') were large apartment buildings where the lower and middle classes of [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] (the [[plebs]]) dwelled.

Many others were built as [[council flat]]s. Many [[Tower blocks in Great Britain|tower blocks]] were built after the [[Second World War]]. A number of these have been demolished and replaced with low-rise buildings or [[housing estate]]s.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the concept of the flat was slow to catch on amongst the British middle classes, which generally followed the north European standard of single-family houses dating far back into history. Those who lived in flats were assumed to be lower class and somewhat itinerant, renting for example a \"flat above a shop\" as part of a lease agreement for a tradesman. In London and most of Britain, everyone who could afford to do so occupied an entire house\u2014even if this was a small [[terraced house]]\u2014while the working poor continued to rent rooms in often overcrowded properties, with one (or more) families per room.\n\nDuring the last quarter of the 19th century, as wealth increased, ideas began to change. Both urban growth and the increase in population meant that more imaginative housing concepts would be needed if the middle and upper classes were to maintain a {{Lang|fr|[[pied-\u00e0-terre]]}} in the capital. The traditional [[Townhouse (Great Britain)|London town house]] was becoming increasingly expensive to maintain. For bachelors and unmarried women in particular, the idea of renting a modern mansion flat became increasingly popular.\n\nThe first mansion flats in England were:\n*Albert Mansions, which Philip Flower constructed and [[James Thomas Knowles (1831\u20131908)|James Knowles]] designed. These flats were constructed between 1867 and 1870, and were one of the earliest blocks of flats to fill the vacant spaces of the newly-laid out [[Victoria Street, London|Victoria Street]] at the end of the 1860s. Today, only a sliver of the building remains, next to the [[Victoria Palace Theatre]]. Albert Mansions was really 19 separate \"houses\", each with a staircase serving one flat per floor. Its tenants included [[Sir Arthur Sullivan]] and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Lord Alfred Tennyson]], whose connections with the developer's family were long-standing. Philip Flower's son, [[Cyril Flower, 1st Baron Battersea|1st Baron Cyril Flower Battersea]], developed most of the mansion blocks on [[Prince of Wales Drive, London]].\n*Albert Hall Mansions, designed by [[Richard Norman Shaw]] in 1876. Because this was a new type of housing, Shaw reduced risks as much as possible; each block was planned as a separate project, with the building of each part contingent on the successful occupation of every flat in the previous block. The gamble paid off and was a success.\n\n===Scotland===\n[[File:Victorian tenement at Boroughmuirhead, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|[[Tenement]] in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] (1893)]]\n[[File:Tenementedin.jpg|thumb|right|Tenement in Marchmont, Edinburgh, built in 1882]]\nIn [[Scotland]], the term \"[[tenement]]\" lacks the pejorative connotations it carries elsewhere and refers simply to any block of flats sharing a common central staircase and lacking an elevator, particularly those constructed before 1919. Tenements were, and continue to be, inhabited by a wide range of social classes and income groups. Tenements today are bought by a wide range of social types, including young professionals, older [[retirees]], and by [[absentee landlords]], often for rental to students after they leave [[dorm|halls of residence]] managed by their institution. The [[National Trust for Scotland]] [[Tenement House (Glasgow)]] is a [[historic house museum]] offering an insight into the lifestyle of tenement dwellers, as it was generations ago.\n\nDuring the 19th century tenements became the predominant type of new housing in [[Scotland]]'s industrial cities, although they were very common in the [[Old Town, Edinburgh|Old Town]] in Edinburgh from the 15th century, where they reached ten or eleven storeys and in one case fourteen storeys. Built of [[sandstone]] or [[granite]], Scottish tenements are usually three to five storeys in height, with two to four flats on each floor. (In contrast, industrial cities in England tended to favour \"[[Back-to-back houses|back-to-back]]\" [[terraced house|terrace]]s of [[brick]].) Scottish tenements are constructed in terraces, and each entrance within a block is referred to as a ''close'' or ''stair''\u2014both referring to the shared passageway to the individual flats. Flights of stairs and landings are generally designated common areas, and residents traditionally took turns to sweep clean the floors and, in [[Aberdeen]] in particular, took turns to make use of shared laundry facilities in the \"back green\" (garden or yard). It is now more common for cleaning of the common ways to be contracted out through a managing agent or \"factor\".\n\nIn [[Glasgow]], where Scotland's highest concentration of tenement dwellings can be found, the urban renewal projects of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s brought an end to the city's slums, which had primarily consisted of older tenements built in the early 19th century in which large [[extended families]] would live together in cramped conditions. They were replaced by high-rise blocks that, within a couple of decades, became notorious for crime and poverty. The [[Glasgow Corporation]] made many efforts to improve the situation, most successfully with the City Improvement Trust, which cleared the slums of the old town, replacing them with what they thought of as a traditional high street, which remains an imposing townscape. (The City Halls and the [[Cleland Testimonial]] were part of this scheme.) National government help was given following [[World War I]] when Housing Acts sought to provide \"homes fit for heroes\". Garden suburb areas, based on English models, such as [[Knightswood]], were set up. These proved too expensive, so a modern tenement, three stories high, slate roofed and built of reconstituted stone, was re-introduced and a [[slum clearance]] programme initiated to clear areas such as the [[Calton, Glasgow|Calton]] and the [[Garngad]].\n\nAfter [[Second World War|World War II]], more ambitious plans, known as the [[Bruce Plan]], were made for the complete evacuation of slums for modern mid-rise housing developments on the outskirts of the city. However, the central government refused to fund the plans, preferring instead to depopulate the city to a series of [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Towns.]]<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Williamson, E., Riches, A. & Higgs, M.

These housing estates, known as \"schemes\", came therefore to be widely regarded as unsuccessful; many, such as [[Castlemilk]], were just dormitories well away from the centre of the city with no amenities, such as shops and [[public houses]] (\"deserts with windows\", as [[Billy Connolly]] once put it). High-rise living too started off with bright ambition\u2014the Moss Heights, built in the 1950s, are still desirable\u2014but fell prey to later economic pressure. Many of the later tower blocks were poorly designed and cheaply built and their anonymity caused some social problems. The demolition of the tower blocks in order to build modern housing schemes has in some cases led to a re-interpretations of the tenement.\n\nIn 1970 a team from [[Strathclyde University]] demonstrated that the old tenements had been basically sound, and could be given new life with replumbing providing modern kitchens and bathrooms.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> The Corporation acted on this principle for the first time in 1973 at the ''Old Swan Corner'', [[Pollokshaws]]. Thereafter, ''Housing Action Areas'' were set up to renovate so-called slums. Later, privately owned tenements benefited from government help in \"stone cleaning\", revealing a honey-coloured sandstone behind the presumed \"grey\" tenemental facades. The policy of tenement demolition is now considered to have been short-sighted, wasteful and largely unsuccessful. Many of Glasgow's worst tenements were refurbished into desirable accommodation in the 1970s and 1980s<ref>[http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/springburn/spring066.htm Glasgow Digital Library: Demolition of tenements in Gourlay Street, 1975]</ref> and the policy of demolition is considered to have destroyed fine examples of a \"universally admired architectural\" style.<!-- <ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> --> The [[Glasgow Housing Association]] took ownership of the public housing stock from the city council on 7 March 2003, and has begun a \u00a396 million clearance and demolition programme to clear and demolish many of the high-rise flats.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090105180936/http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/News/Archives/2006/May/housingrevolutionannounced.htm Glasgow announces a revolution in house-building] Wednesday 31 May 2006.</ref>\n\n===United States===\n[[File:NewtonMA TheChestnutHill.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Chestnut Hill]], an 1899 apartment house in [[Newton, Massachusetts]]]]\n[[File:East 57th St Apartments.jpg|thumb|right|Apartment buildings lining the residential stretch of East 57th Street between First Avenue and Sutton Place in New York]]\n[[File:LowerEastSideTenements.JPG|thumb|right|[[Tenement]] buildings in [[Manhattan]]'s Lower East Side]]\n\nIn 1839, the first New York City [[tenement]] was built, and soon became breeding grounds for [[outlaw]]s, [[juvenile delinquent]]s, and [[organized crime]]. Tenements, or their slum landlords, were also known for their [[price gouging]] rent. ''How the Other Half Lives'' notes one tenement district:\n\n<blockquote>Blind Man's Alley bear its name for a reason. Until little more than a year ago its dark burrows harbored a colony of blind beggars, tenants of a blind landlord, old Daniel Murphy, whom every child in the ward knows, if he never heard of the President of the United States. \"Old Dan\" made a big fortune--he told me once four hundred thousand dollars-- out of his alley and the surrounding tenements, only to grow blind himself in extreme old age, sharing in the end the chief hardship of the wretched beings whose lot he had stubbornly refused to better that he might increase his wealth. Even when the [[Metropolitan Board of Health|Board of Health]] at last compelled him to repair and clean up the worst of the old buildings, under threat of driving out the tenants and locking the doors behind them, the work was accomplished against the old man's angry protests. He appeared in person before the Board to argue his case, and his argument was characteristic. \"I have made my will,\" he said. \"My monument stands waiting for me in Calvary. I stand on the very brink of the grave, blind and helpless, and now (here the pathos of the appeal was swept under in a burst of angry indignation) do you want me to build and get skinned, skinned? These people are not fit to live in a nice house. Let them go where they can, and let my house stand.\" In spite of the genuine anguish of the appeal, it was downright amusing to find that his anger was provoked less by the anticipated waste of luxury on his tenants than by distrust of his own kind, the builder. He knew intuitively what to expect. The result showed that Mr. Murphy had gauged his tenants correctly.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Riis|first1=Jacob A.|title=How the other half lives : studies among the tenements of New York|date=1890|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York|isbn=9111562986| pages=31\u201332|edition=1st|url=https://archive.org/stream/howotherhalflive00riis_1|accessdate=2 January 2017}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMany campaigners, such as [[Upton Sinclair]] and [[Jacob Riis]], pushed for reforms in tenement dwellings. As a result, the [[New York State Tenement House Act]] was passed in 1901 to improve the conditions. More improvements followed. In 1949, President [[Harry S. Truman]] signed the [[Housing Act of 1949]] to clean slums and reconstruct housing units for the poor.\n\n[[The Dakota]] (1884) was one of the first luxury apartment buildings in New York City. The majority, however, remained tenements.\n\nSome significant developments in architectural design of apartment buildings came out of the 1950s and '60s.  Among them were groundbreaking designs in the [[860-880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments]] (1951), [[New Century Guild]] (1961), [[Marina City]] (1964) and [[Lake Point Tower]] (1968).\n\nIn the United States, \"tenement\" is a label usually applied to the less expensive, more basic rental apartment buildings in older sections of large cities. Many of these apartment buildings are \"walk-ups\" without an elevator, and some have shared bathing facilities, though this is becoming less common. The slang term \"[[Dingbat (building)|dingbat]]\" is used to describe cheap urban apartment buildings from the 1950s and 1960s with unique and often wacky fa\u00e7ades to differentiate themselves within a full block of apartments. They are often built on stilts, and with parking underneath.\n\n====Property classes====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nIn the United States, properties are typically in one of four property classes, denoted by a letter grade. These grades are used to help [[investor]]s and [[real estate brokers]] speak a common language so they can understand a property's characteristics and condition quickly. They are as follows:\n\n''Class A'' properties are luxury units. They are usually less than 10 years old and are often new, upscale apartment buildings. Average rents are high, and they are generally in desirable geographic areas. [[White-collar worker]]s live in them and are usually renters by choice.\n\n''Class B'' properties can be 10 to 25 years old. They are generally well maintained and have a middle class tenant base of both white- and blue-collar workers. Some are renters by choice, and others by necessity.\n\n''Class C'' properties were built within the last 30 to 40 years. They generally have blue-collar and low- to moderate-income tenants, and the rents are below market. Many tenants are renters \"for life\". On the other hand, some of their tenants are just starting out and are likely to work their way up the rental scale as their income rises.\n\n''Class D'' properties house many [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] (government-subsidized) tenants. They are generally located in lower socioeconomic areas.\n\n===Canada===\nApartments were popular in Canada, particularly in urban centres like Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, and Hamilton in the 1950s to 1970s. By the 1980s, many multi-unit buildings were being constructed as [[condominium]]s instead of apartments\u2014both are now very common. In Toronto and Vancouver, high-rise apartments and condominiums have been spread around the city, giving even the major suburbs a skyline. The robustness of the condo markets in Toronto and Vancouver are based on the lack of land availability.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wang |first=Sissi |url=http://www.canadianbusiness.com/economy/the-latest-threat-to-the-condo-market-apartment-buildings-rise-again/ |title=The latest threat to the condo market: apartment buildings rise again |work=Canadian Business |date=8 July 2015 |accessdate=17 October 2015}}</ref> The average capitalization rate in the Greater Toronto Area for Q3 2015 hit its lowest level in 30 years: in Q3 2015 it stood at 3.75 per cent, down from 4.2 per cent in Q2 2015 and down almost 50 per cent from the 6.3 per cent posted in Q3 2010.<ref>{{cite web |last=DiGianfelice |first=Lorenzo |url=https://www.reminetwork.com/articles/gta-cap-rate-hits-new-benchmark-low/ |title=GTA cap rate hits new benchmark low |work=Canadian Apartment Magazine |date=9 October 2015 |accessdate=17 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Australia===\n[[File:Q1 Q Deck day.JPG|thumb|The skyline of the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in [[Queensland]] is dominated by apartments.]]\n[[File:Canterbury flats st kilda.jpg|thumb|right|The Canterbury in [[St Kilda, Victoria]] is one of the earliest surviving apartment buildings in Australia.]]\n[[File:(1)One Central Park.jpg|thumb|[[One Central Park]], Sydney, which features vertical [[Hanging garden (cultivation)|hanging gardens]] and sustainable [[green design]]]]\n\nApartment buildings in Australia are typically managed by a [[body corporate]] or \"owners corporation\" in which owners pay a monthly fee to provide for common maintenance and help cover future repair. Many apartments are owned through [[strata title]]. Due to legislation, Australian banks will either apply [[loan to value]] ratios of over 70 per cent for strata titles of less than 50 square metres, the [[Big four banks|big four Australian banks]] will not loan at all for strata titles of less than 30 square metres. These are usually classified as studio apartments or student accommodation. Australian legislation enforces a minimum 2.4{{Spaces|fig=}}m floor-ceiling height which differentiates apartment buildings from office buildings.\n\nIn Australia, apartment living is a popular lifestyle choice for [[DINKY]], [[yuppie]]s, [[university student]]s and more recently [[empty nester]]s, however, rising land values in the big cities in recent years has seen an increase in families living in apartments. In [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]] apartment living is sometimes not a matter of choice for the many socially disadvantaged people who often end up in public housing towers.\n\nAustralia has a relatively recent history in apartment buildings. [[Terrace houses]] were the early response to density development, though the majority of Australians lived in fully detached houses. Apartments of any kind were legislated against in the [[Parliament of Queensland]] as part of the [[Undue Subdivision of Land Prevention Act 1885]].\n\nThe earliest apartment buildings were in the major cities of [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]] as the response to fast rising land values\u2013both cities are home to the two oldest surviving apartment buildings in the country, Kingsclere in [[Potts Point]], and The Canterbury Flats in [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]]. [[Melbourne Mansions]] on [[Collins Street, Melbourne]] (now demolished), built in 1906 for mostly wealthy residents is believed by many to be the earliest. Today the oldest surviving self-contained apartment buildings are in the [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]] area including the Fawkner Mansions (1910), Majestic Mansions (1912 as a boarding house) and the Canterbury (1914\u2014the oldest surviving buildings contained flats).<ref>{{cite web |last=Peterson |first=Richard |url=http://www.skhs.org.au/SKHSbuildings/pdf%20files/21.pdf |title=The Canterbury (Flats) - 236 Canterbury Road, St Kilda West |work=A Place of Sensuous Resort: Buildings of St Kilda and Their People |publisher=St Kilda Historical Society |date=2005 |access-date=17 October 2015}}</ref> Kingsclere, built in 1912 is believed to be the earliest apartment building in Sydney and still survives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/heritagensw/win00/8_art.htm |title=High Rise has a past too |publisher=Heritage.nsw.gov.au |accessdate=25 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020628220428/http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/heritagensw/win00/8_art.htm |archive-date=28 June 2002 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the interwar years, apartment building continued in inner Melbourne (particularly in areas such as St Kilda and [[South Yarra]]), Sydney (particularly in areas such as [[Potts Point, New South Wales|Potts Point]], [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales|Darlinghust]] and [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]]) and in Brisbane (in areas such as [[New Farm, Queensland|New Farm]], [[Fortitude Valley, Queensland|Fortitude Valley]] and [[Spring Hill, Queensland|Spring Hill]]).\n\nPost-[[World War II]], with the [[Australian Dream]] apartment buildings went out of vogue and flats were seen as accommodation only for the poor. Walk-up flats (without a lift) of two to three storeys however were common in the middle suburbs of cities for lower income groups.\n\nThe main exceptions were Sydney and the [[Gold Coast, Queensland]] where apartment development continued for more than half a century. In Sydney a limited geography and highly sought after waterfront views ([[Sydney Harbour]] and beaches such as [[Bondi Beach, New South Wales|Bondi]]) made apartment living socially acceptable. While on the Gold Coast views of the ocean, proximity to the beach and a large tourist population made apartments a popular choice. Since the 1960s, these cities maintained much higher population densities than the rest of Australia through the acceptance of apartment buildings.\n\nIn other cities, apartment building was almost solely restricted to [[public housing]]. [[Public housing in Australia]] was common in the larger cities, particularly in Melbourne (by the [[Housing Commission of Victoria]]) where a huge number of hi-rise housing commission flats were built between the 1950s and 1970s by successive governments as part of an urban renewal program. Areas affected included [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]], [[Flemington, Victoria|Flemington]], [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]], [[Carlton, Victoria|Carlton]], [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]] and [[Prahran, Victoria|Prahran]]. Similar projects were run in Sydney's lower socio-economic areas like [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]].\n\nIn the 1980s, modern apartment buildings sprang up in riverside locations in [[Brisbane]] (along the [[Brisbane River]]) and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] (along the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]]).\n\nIn Melbourne, in the 1990s, a trend began for apartment buildings without the requirement of spectacular views. As a continuation of the [[gentrification]] of the inner city, a fashion became New York \"loft\" style apartments (see above) and a large stock of old warehouses and old abandoned office buildings in and around the central business district became the target of developers. The trend of [[adaptive reuse]] extended to conversion of old churches and schools. Similar warehouse conversions and gentrification began in Brisbane suburbs such as [[Teneriffe, Queensland]] and Fortitude Valley and in Sydney in areas such as [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]]. As supply of buildings for conversion ran out, reproduction and post modern style apartments followed. The popularity of these apartments also stimulated a boom in the construction of new hi-rise apartment buildings in inner cities. This was particularly the case in Melbourne which was fuelled by official planning policies ([[Postcode 3000]]), making the CBD the fastest growing, population wise in the country. Apartment building in the Melbourne metropolitan area has also escalated with the advent of the [[Melbourne 2030]] planning policy. [[Urban renewal]] areas like [[Melbourne Docklands|Docklands]], [[Southbank, Victoria|Southbank]], [[St Kilda Road]] and [[Port Melbourne]] are now predominantly apartments. There has also been a sharp increase in the number of student apartment buildings in areas such as Carlton in Melbourne.\n\nDespite their size, other smaller cities including [[Canberra]], [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Townsville]], [[Cairns]], [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], [[Wollongong, New South Wales|Wollongong]], [[Adelaide]] and [[Geelong]] have begun building apartments in the 2000s.\n\nToday, residential buildings [[Eureka Tower]] and [[Q1 (building)|Q1]] are the tallest in the country. In many cases, apartments in [[inner city]] areas of the major cities can cost much more than much larger houses in the outer suburbs.\n\nSome Australian cities, such as [[Gold Coast, Queensland]], are inhabited predominantly by apartment dwellers.\n\n===Yugoslavia===\nThe development of residential architecture in [[Yugoslavia]] during the period of [[socialism]] had its peak in the 1960s and 1970s. Significant progress in construction was accompanied by housing research directed towards finding the optimal urbanistic solutions for the newly formed lifestyle of the socialist society. The tendency was to \"pack\" as many [[residential]] units as possible into each building, almost up to the limits of the functional minimum, at the same time with the aim of setting a more humane pattern of living.<ref>Lojanica, V., Risti\u0107, J., Me\u0111o, V.

There are many names for these overall buildings, see below. The [[housing tenure]] of apartments also varies considerably, from large-scale [[public housing]], to [[owner occupancy]] within what is legally a [[condominium]] ([[strata title]] or [[commonhold]]), to tenants renting from a private landlord (see [[leasehold estate]]).\n\n==Terminology==\n===\"Flat\" vs \"apartment\"===\nBoth words refer to a self-contained residential unit with its own front door, kitchen, toilet, and [[bathroom]]. In some parts of the world, the word ''apartment'' refers to a purpose-built unit in a building, whereas the word ''flat'' means a converted unit in an older building, usually a big house.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} In other places the terms are interchangeable.\n\nThe term ''apartment'' is favored in North America (although in some cities ''flat'' is used for a unit which is part of a house containing two or three units, typically one to a floor<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lexico.com/definition/apartment|title=Apartment {{!}} Meaning of Apartment by Lexico|website=Lexico Dictionaries {{!}} English|language=en|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}). In the UK, the term  ''apartment'' is more usual in professional [[real estate]] and [[architectural]] circles where otherwise the term ''flat'' is used commonly, but not exclusively, for an apartment on a single level (hence a 'flat' apartment).\n\nIn some countries, the word \"[[Unit (housing)|unit]]\" is a more general term referring to both apartments and rental business [[Suite (address)|suite]]s. The word 'unit' is generally used only in the context of a specific building; e.g., \"This building has three units\" or \"I'm going to rent a unit in this building\", but not \"I'm going to rent a unit somewhere\".\n\nSome buildings can be characterized as 'mixed-use buildings', meaning part of the building is for commercial, business, or office use, usually on the first floor or first couple of floors, and one or more apartments are found in the rest of the building, usually on the upper floors.\n\n===By housing tenure===\n[[File:St James Town1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Low-income housing]] of the [[St. James Town]] neighborhood in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada]]\n[[File:Cove, Punggol Field.JPG|thumb|right|[[Housing Development Board]] flats in [[Punggol]], [[Singapore]] ]]\n\n([[Condominium]], [[public housing]], [[owner-occupancy]], etc.)\n\n[[Tenement (law)|Tenement law]] refers to the [[feudalism|feudal]] basis of permanent property such as land or rents. It may be found combined as in \"[[Messuage]] or Tenement\" to encompass all the land, buildings and other assets of a property.\n\nIn the United States, some apartment-dwellers own their units, either as a [[housing cooperative]], in which the residents own shares of a corporation that owns the building or development; or in a [[condominium]], whose residents own their apartments and share ownership of the public spaces. Most apartments are in buildings designed for the purpose, but large older [[house]]s are sometimes divided into apartments. The word ''apartment'' denotes a residential unit or section in a building. In some locations, particularly the United States, the word connotes a rental unit owned by the building owner, and is not typically used for a condominium.\n\nIn England and Wales, some flat owners own shares in the company that owns the [[Fee simple|freehold]] of the building as well as holding the flat under a lease.  This arrangement is commonly known as a \"share of freehold\" flat. The freehold company has the right to collect annual ground rents from each of the flat owners in the building. The freeholder can also develop or sell the building, subject to the usual planning and restrictions that might apply. This situation does not happen in Scotland, where long leasehold of residential property was formerly unusual, and is now impossible.<ref>{{cite web| title=Long Leases (Scotland) Act 2012| website=UK Legislation| date=2012| url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2012/9/contents/enacted | accessdate=9 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===By size of the unit===\nBachelor apartment, one-[[bedroom]], etc.; see below.\n\n===By size of the building===\n[[File:English Bay Vancouver.jpg|thumb|right|[[High-rise building]]s in the [[English Bay (Vancouver)|English Bay]] area of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada]]\n[[File:Fatima 0549 (19531851070).jpg|thumb|left|A [[low-rise building]] of flats above shops in [[F\u00e1tima, Portugal]]]]\n\nApartment buildings are [[multi-story]] buildings where three or more residences are contained within one structure. Such a building may be called an ''apartment building'', ''apartment complex'', ''flat complex'', ''block of flats'', ''tower block'', ''high-rise'' or, occasionally, ''mansion block'' (in British English), especially if it consists of many apartments for rent. A high-rise apartment building is commonly referred to as a ''residential tower'', ''apartment tower'', or ''block of flats'' in Australia.\n\nA [[high-rise building]] is defined by its height differently in various [[jurisdiction]]s. It may be only residential, in which case it might also be called a tower block, or it might include other functions such as hotel, offices, or shops. There is no clear difference between a tower block and a [[skyscraper]], although a building with fifty or more stories is generally considered a skyscraper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/547956/skyscraper|title=skyscraper|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc|accessdate=19 September 2012}}</ref> High-rise buildings became possible with the invention of the [[elevator]] (lift) and cheaper, more abundant building materials. Their [[structural system]] usually is made of [[reinforced concrete]] and [[steel]].\n\nA [[low-rise building]] and mid-rise buildings have fewer storeys, but the limits are not always clear. [[Emporis]] defines a low-rise as \"an enclosed structure below 35 metres [115 feet] which is divided into regular floor levels.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://standards.emporis.com/?nav=realestate&lng=3&esn=49213 |title=Data Standards: Structures - low-rise building |publisher=Emporis Standards |accessdate=10 June 2009}}</ref> The city of [[Toronto]] defines a mid-rise as a building between 4 and 12 stories.<ref>http://faculty.geog.utoronto.ca/Hess/Courses/studio/presentation%20on%20avenues%20and%20mid-rise%20study.pdf</ref>\n\n===By country===\nIn [[American English]], the distinction between rental apartments and [[condominium]]s is that while rental buildings are owned by a single entity and rented out to many, condominiums are owned individually, while their owners still pay a monthly or yearly fee for building upkeep. Condominiums are often leased by their owner as rental apartments. A third alternative, the [[Housing cooperative|cooperative apartment]] building (or \"co-op\"), acts as a corporation with all of the tenants as shareholders of the building. Tenants in cooperative buildings do not own their apartment, but instead own a proportional number of shares of the entire cooperative. As in condominiums, cooperators pay a monthly fee for building upkeep. Co-ops are common in cities such as New York, and have gained some popularity in other larger urban areas in the U.S.\n\nIn [[British English]] the usual word is \"flat\", but ''apartment'' is used by property developers to denote expensive 'flats' in exclusive and expensive residential areas in, for example, parts of London such as [[Belgravia]] and [[Hampstead]]. In Scotland, it is called a block of flats or, if it is a traditional sandstone building, a ''[[tenement]]'', a term which has a negative connotation elsewhere.\n\nIn India, the word flat is used to refer to multi-storey dwellings that have lifts.<ref>[https://www.magicbricks.com/flats-in-new-delhi-for-sale-pppfs]</ref>\n\n[[Australian English]] and [[New Zealand English]] traditionally used the term ''flat'' (although it also applies to any rental property), and more recently also use the terms ''unit'' or ''apartment''. In Australia, a 'unit' refers to flats, apartments or even [[semi-detached]] houses. In Australia, the terms \"unit\", \"flat\" and \"apartment\" are largely used interchangeably. Newer high-rise buildings are more often marketed as \"apartments\", as the term \"flats\" carries colloquial connotations. The term condominium or condo is rarely used in Australia despite attempts by developers to market it.\n\nIn [[South African English]], an apartment is usually a single level rental area that is a part of a larger building and can be entered from inside the building through a separate door leading off either a wind tunnel or entrance hall/lobby that is shared with other occupants of the building.\n\nIn [[Malaysian English]], ''flat'' often denotes a housing block of two rooms with walk-up, no lift, without facilities, typically five storeys tall, and with outdoor parking space,<ref>[https://www.propsocial.my/topic/226/categories-of-homes-in-malaysia-posted-by-propsocial-editor?all=1 Categories of Homes in Malaysia.]</ref> while ''apartment'' is more generic and may also include luxury condominiums.\n\nIn Japanese English [[loanword]]s (''[[Wasei-eigo]]''), the term ''apartment'' (''apaato'') is used for lower-income housing and ''mansion'' (''manshon'') is used for high-end apartments; but both terms refer to what English-speakers regard as an apartment (or condominium) and not the level of luxury of a [[mansion]] in English parlance. See [[Housing in Japan]]. ''[[Danchi]]'' is the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word for a large cluster of apartment buildings of a particular style and design, typically built as [[public housing]] by government authorities.\n\n==Types and characteristics==\n===Studio apartment===\n[[File:Cuisinette studio in Sherbrooke April 2010.jpg|thumb|Studio apartment in [[Sherbrooke, Quebec]], Canada, showing double bed, kitchenette, and entrance way with sliding door to closet]]\n{{Main|Studio apartment}}\n{{See also|Microapartment}}\nThe smallest self-contained apartments are referred to as studio, efficiency or bachelor apartments in the US, or studio flat in the UK. These units usually consist of a large single main room which acts as the living room, dining room and bedroom combined and usually also includes kitchen facilities, with a separate bathroom. In Korea, the term \"one room\" (''wonroom'') refers to a studio apartment.<ref>{{cite web | title='Konglish' Not Spoken Here: Asia Society Korea Center Targets Signs and Schoolbooks | website=Asia Society | date=11 October 2012  | url=http://asiasociety.org/blog/asia/konglish-not-spoken-here-asia-society-korea-center-targets-signs-and-schoolbooks | accessdate=5 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nA [[bedsit]] is a UK variant on single room accommodation: a bed-sitting room, probably without cooking facilities, with a shared bathroom.

Such a garden apartment shares some characteristics of a [[townhouse]]: each apartment has its own building entrance, or shares that entrance via a staircase and lobby that adjoins other units immediately above and/or below it. Unlike a townhouse, each apartment occupies only one level. Such garden apartment buildings are almost never more than three stories high, since they typically lack [[elevator]]s. However, the first \"garden apartment\" buildings in New York, USA, built in the early 1900s, were constructed five stories high.<ref>[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/garden_apartments/ New York City Garden Apartments] retrieved 17 October 2009</ref><ref>Hogan, Meghan.

The large [[townhouse (Great Britain)|Georgian or Victorian townhouse]] was built with an excavated subterranean space around its front known as [[Area (architecture)|an area]], often surrounded by cast iron railings. This lowest floor housed the kitchen, the main place of work for the servants, with a \"tradesman's entrance\" via the area stairs. This \"lower ground floor\" (another euphemism) has proven ideal for conversion to a self-contained \"garden flat\". One American term for this arrangement is an [[English basement]].\n\n===Basement apartment===\n{{Main|Basement apartment}}\nGenerally on the lowest floor of a building.\n\n===Secondary suite===\n{{Main|Secondary suite}}\nWhen part of a house is converted for the ostensible use of the owner's family member, the self-contained dwelling may be known as an \"in-law apartment\", \"annexe\", or \"granny flat\", though these (sometimes illegally) created units are often occupied by ordinary renters rather than the landlord's relative. In Canada these are commonly located below the main house and are therefore \"basement suites\".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Another term is an \"accessory dwelling unit\", which may be part of the main house, or a free-standing structure in its grounds.\n\n===Salon apartment===\n''Salon apartment'' is a term linked to the exclusive apartments built as part of multi-family houses in [[Belgrade]] and in certain towns in [[Yugoslavia]] in the first decades of the 20th century.<ref>Alfirevi\u0107 \u0110or\u0111e, Simonovi\u0107 Alfirevi\u0107 San\u0458a.

This is a very common arrangement in much post-War British public housing, serving both to reduce costs by reducing the amount of space given to access corridors and to emulate the 'traditional' two-storey terrace house to which many of the residents would have been accustomed.\n\nA maisonette could encompass [[Tyneside flat]]s, pairs of single-storey flats within a two-storey [[terraced house|terrace]]. Their distinctive feature is their use of two separate front doors onto the street, each door leading to a single flat.<ref name=\"Housing in Gateshead\" >{{Cite web\n  |title=Housing in Gateshead\n  |url=http://www.gateshead.gov.uk/DocumentLibrary/housing/Leaflets/display_boards.pdf\n  |publisher=Gateshead Council\n  |year=2006\n}}</ref> \"Maisonette\" could also stretch to [[cottage flat]]s, also known as 'Four-in-a-block flats', a style of housing common in Scotland.\n\n===One dwelling with two storeys===\n[[File:ScissorFlat.jpg|thumb|Plan of scissor flats.]]\nThe vast majority of apartments are on one level, hence \"flat\". Some, however, have two storeys, joined internally by stairs, just as many houses do. One term for this is \"maisonette\", as above. Some [[public housing in the United Kingdom]] was designed as [[scissor section flat]]s. On a grander level, [[penthouse apartment|penthouses]] may have more than one storey, to emphasise the idea of space and luxury.\n\nTwo storey units in new construction are sometimes referred to as \"[[townhouse]]s\".\n\n===Small buildings with a few one-storey dwellings===\n[[File:CambridgeTripleDecker.jpg|thumb|A triple-decker in New England.]]\n[[File:Dingbat MaryJane.jpg|thumb|left|Dingbat MaryJane]]\n\n\"[[Duplex (building)|Duplex]]\" refers to two separate units with a [[party wall|common demising wall]] or floor-ceiling assembly.\n\nDuplex description can be different depending on the part of the US, but generally has two to four dwellings with a door for each and usually two front doors close together but separate - referred to as '[[Duplex (building)|duplex]]' indicating the number of units, not the number of floors, as in some areas of the country they are often only one story. The term duplex is largely unknown in the UK; there, buildings containing two dwellings with a common vertical wall are known as ''semi-detached'' or just ''a semi'' (the i pronounced \"ee\" not \"eye\"), but the dwellings are usually two storeys (excluding any use of the roof space). This form of construction is very common, and built as such rather than a later conversion.\n\nIn the United States, regional forms have developed, see [[vernacular architecture]]. In [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], a [[Polish flat]] or \"raised cottage\" is an existing small house that has been lifted up to accommodate the creation of a basement floor housing a separate apartment, then set down again, thus becoming a modest pair of dwellings.<ref>{{cite book|editor-first=Sally |editor-last=McMurray |title=People, Power, Places|date=2000|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=9781572330757|page=40|edition=1st}}</ref> In the [[Sun Belt]], boxy small apartment buildings called [[Dingbat (building)|dingbats]], often with [[carport]]s below, sprang up from the 1950s.\n\nGroups of more than two units have corresponding names (Triplex, etc.).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Those buildings that have a third storey are known as triplexes. See [[Three-decker (house)]]. Again, the term triplex is virtually unknown in the UK.\n\n===Loft apartment===\n[[File:400SGreenLoft.jpg|thumb|The interior of a loft conversion in Chicago]]\n{{Main|Loft#Loft_apartment}}\nThis type of apartment developed in North America during the middle of the 20th century. The term initially described a living space created within a former industrial building, usually 19th century. These large apartments found favor with artists and musicians wanting accommodation in large cities (New York for example) and is related to unused buildings in the decaying parts of such cities being occupied illegally by people [[squatting]].\n\nThese loft apartments were usually located in former highrise warehouses and factories left vacant after town planning rules and economic conditions in the mid 20th century changed. The resulting apartments created a new bohemian lifestyle and are arranged in a completely different way from most urban living spaces, often including workshops and art studio spaces. As the supply of old buildings of a suitable nature has dried up, developers have responded by constructing new buildings in the same aesthetic with varying degrees of success.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nAn industrial, warehouse, or commercial space converted to an apartment is commonly called a ''[[loft]]'', although some modern lofts are built by design.\n\n===Penthouse===\n{{Main|Penthouse apartment}}\nAn apartment located on the top floor of a high-rise apartment building.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Communal apartment===\n{{Main|Communal apartment}}\nIn [[Russia]], a communal apartment (\u00ab\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0443\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0430\u00bb) is a room with a shared kitchen and bath. A typical arrangement is a cluster of five or so room-apartments with a common kitchen and bathroom and separate front doors, occupying a floor in a pre-Revolutionary mansion. Traditionally a room is owned by the government and assigned to a family on a semi-permanent basis.<ref>{{cite web|title=Naherholung gleich ums Eck|url=http://www.terrafinanz.de/brenner-park-sendling|publisher=terrafinanz.de|accessdate=17 June 2013|language=German}}</ref>\n\n===Serviced apartment===\n[[File:PAJASA Service Apartment Mumbai.jpg|thumb|Serviced apartment, Mumbai, India]]\n{{Main|Serviced apartment}}\n{{See also|Apartment hotel|Corporate housing}}\nA \"serviced apartment\" is any size space for residential living which includes regular maid and cleaning services provided by the rental agent. Serviced apartments or serviced flats developed in the early part of the 20th century and were briefly fashionable in the 1920s and 30s. They are intended to combine the best features of luxury and self-contained apartments, often being an adjunct of a [[hotel]]. Like guests semi-permanently installed in a luxury hotel, residents could enjoy the additional facilities such as house keeping, laundry, catering and other services if and when desired.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nA feature of these apartment blocks was quite glamorous interiors with lavish bathrooms but no kitchen or laundry spaces in each flat. This style of living became very fashionable as many upper-class people found they could not afford as many live-in staff after the First World War and revelled in a \"lock-up and leave\" life style that serviced apartment hotels supplied. Some buildings have been subsequently renovated with standard facilities in each apartment, but serviced apartment hotel complexes continue to be constructed. Recently a number of hotels have supplemented their traditional business model with serviced apartment wings, creating privately owned areas within their buildings - either [[freehold (law)|freehold]] or [[leasehold]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Facilities===\n[[File:Laundry Room.jpg|thumb|Laundry Room]]\nApartments may be available for rent furnished, with furniture, or unfurnished into which a tenant moves in with their own furniture. [[Serviced apartment]]s, intended to be convenient for shorter stays, include soft furnishings and [[List of food preparation utensils|kitchen utensils]], and [[maid service]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n[[Laundry#Shared_laundry_rooms|Laundry facilities]] may reside in a common area accessible to all building tenants, or each apartment may have its own facilities. Depending on when the building was built and its design, utilities such as water, heating, and electricity may be common for all of the apartments, or separate for each apartment and billed separately to each tenant. (Many areas in the US have ruled it illegal to split a water bill among all the tenants, especially if a pool is on the premises.) Outlets for connection to telephones are typically included in apartments. Telephone service is optional and is almost always billed separately from the rent payments. Cable television and similar amenities also cost extra. Parking space(s), air conditioning, and extra storage space may or may not be included with an apartment. Rental [[Rental agreement|lease]]s often limit the maximum number of residents in each apartment.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nOn or around the ground floor of the apartment building, a series of [[Letter box|mailbox]]es are typically kept in a location accessible to the public and, thus, to the [[mail carrier]]. Every unit typically gets its own mailbox with individual keys to it. Some very large apartment buildings with a full-time staff may take mail from the carrier and provide mail-sorting service. Near the mailboxes or some other location accessible by outsiders, a buzzer (equivalent to a doorbell) may be available for each individual unit. In smaller apartment buildings such as two- or three-flats, or even four-flats, rubbish is often disposed of in trash containers similar to those used at houses. In larger buildings, rubbish is often collected in a common trash bin or dumpster. For cleanliness or minimizing noise, many lessors will place restrictions on tenants regarding smoking or keeping pets in an apartment.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Various===\n[[File:One-by-five Apartments Austin, TX.jpg|thumb|Mid-rise [[One-plus-five]] style apartment buildings in [[Austin, Texas]].]]\nIn more urban areas, apartments close to the [[downtown]] area have the benefits of proximity to jobs and/or [[public transportation]]. However, prices per square foot are often much higher than in suburban areas.\n\nMoving up from studio flats are one-bedroom apartments, in which a bedroom is separate from the rest of the apartment, followed by two-bedroom, three-bedroom, etc. apartments. (Apartments with more than three bedrooms are rare.)\n\nSmall apartments often have only one entrance.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Large apartments often have two entrances, perhaps a door in the front and another in the back, or from an underground or otherwise attached parking structure. Depending on the building design, the entrance doors may be connected directly to the outside or to a common area inside, such as a hallway or a lobby.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nIn many American cities, the [[One-plus-five]] style of mid-rise, wood-framed apartments have gained significant popularity following a 2009 revision to the [[International Building Code]]; these buildings typically feature four wood-framed floors above a concrete podium and are popular with developers due to their high density and relatively lower construction costs.<ref name=\"Curbed\">{{cite web |url=https://www.curbed.com/2018/12/4/18125536/real-estate-modern-apartment-architecture |title=Why do all new apartment buildings look the same? |author=Sissom, Patrick |work=Curbed |date=4 December 2018 |accessdate=23 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Historical examples==\n\n===Pre-Columbian Americas===\nThe [[Puebloan peoples]] of what is now the Southwestern United States have constructed large, multi-room dwellings, some comprising more than 900 rooms, since the 10th century.\n\nIn the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic Period]] [[Mesoamerica]]n city of [[Teotihuacan]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jarus|first1=Owen|title=Teotihuacan: Ancient City of Pyramids|url=http://www.livescience.com/22545-teotihuacan.html|website=Livescience|publisher=Livescience|accessdate=19 March 2016}}</ref> apartments were not only the standard means of housing the city's population of over 200,000 inhabitants, but show a remarkably even wealth distribution for the entire city, even by contemporary standards.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Michael E.|title=Living the good life in Teotihuacan|url=http://wideurbanworld.blogspot.com/2014/10/living-good-life-in-teotihuacan.html|accessdate=19 March 2016|ref=http://wideurbanworld.blogspot.com/2014/10/living-good-life-in-teotihuacan.html}}</ref> Furthermore, the apartments were inhabited by the general populace as a whole,<ref>{{cite web|title=Teotihuacan|url=http://mexicanhistory.org/Teotihuacan.htm|website=Mexican History|accessdate=19 March 2016}}</ref> in contrast to other Pre-Modern socieites, where apartments were limited to housing the lower class members of the society, as with the somewhat contemporary Roman [[insulae]].\n\n===Ancient Rome===\n[[File:OstianInsula.JPG|thumb|Remains of an Ancient Roman apartment block from the early 2nd century AD in [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]]]]\nIn [[ancient Rome]], the [[insulae]] (singular ''insula'') were large apartment buildings where the lower and middle classes of [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] (the [[plebs]]) dwelled.

Many others were built as [[council flat]]s. Many [[Tower blocks in Great Britain|tower blocks]] were built after the [[Second World War]]. A number of these have been demolished and replaced with low-rise buildings or [[housing estate]]s.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the concept of the flat was slow to catch on amongst the British middle classes, which generally followed the north European standard of single-family houses dating far back into history. Those who lived in flats were assumed to be lower class and somewhat itinerant, renting for example a \"flat above a shop\" as part of a lease agreement for a tradesman. In London and most of Britain, everyone who could afford to do so occupied an entire house\u2014even if this was a small [[terraced house]]\u2014while the working poor continued to rent rooms in often overcrowded properties, with one (or more) families per room.\n\nDuring the last quarter of the 19th century, as wealth increased, ideas began to change. Both urban growth and the increase in population meant that more imaginative housing concepts would be needed if the middle and upper classes were to maintain a {{Lang|fr|[[pied-\u00e0-terre]]}} in the capital. The traditional [[Townhouse (Great Britain)|London town house]] was becoming increasingly expensive to maintain. For bachelors and unmarried women in particular, the idea of renting a modern mansion flat became increasingly popular.\n\nThe first mansion flats in England were:\n*Albert Mansions, which Philip Flower constructed and [[James Thomas Knowles (1831\u20131908)|James Knowles]] designed. These flats were constructed between 1867 and 1870, and were one of the earliest blocks of flats to fill the vacant spaces of the newly-laid out [[Victoria Street, London|Victoria Street]] at the end of the 1860s. Today, only a sliver of the building remains, next to the [[Victoria Palace Theatre]]. Albert Mansions was really 19 separate \"houses\", each with a staircase serving one flat per floor. Its tenants included [[Sir Arthur Sullivan]] and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Lord Alfred Tennyson]], whose connections with the developer's family were long-standing. Philip Flower's son, [[Cyril Flower, 1st Baron Battersea|1st Baron Cyril Flower Battersea]], developed most of the mansion blocks on [[Prince of Wales Drive, London]].\n*Albert Hall Mansions, designed by [[Richard Norman Shaw]] in 1876. Because this was a new type of housing, Shaw reduced risks as much as possible; each block was planned as a separate project, with the building of each part contingent on the successful occupation of every flat in the previous block. The gamble paid off and was a success.\n\n===Scotland===\n[[File:Victorian tenement at Boroughmuirhead, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|[[Tenement]] in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] (1893)]]\n[[File:Tenementedin.jpg|thumb|right|Tenement in Marchmont, Edinburgh, built in 1882]]\nIn [[Scotland]], the term \"[[tenement]]\" lacks the pejorative connotations it carries elsewhere and refers simply to any block of flats sharing a common central staircase and lacking an elevator, particularly those constructed before 1919. Tenements were, and continue to be, inhabited by a wide range of social classes and income groups. Tenements today are bought by a wide range of social types, including young professionals, older [[retirees]], and by [[absentee landlords]], often for rental to students after they leave [[dorm|halls of residence]] managed by their institution. The [[National Trust for Scotland]] [[Tenement House (Glasgow)]] is a [[historic house museum]] offering an insight into the lifestyle of tenement dwellers, as it was generations ago.\n\nDuring the 19th century tenements became the predominant type of new housing in [[Scotland]]'s industrial cities, although they were very common in the [[Old Town, Edinburgh|Old Town]] in Edinburgh from the 15th century, where they reached ten or eleven storeys and in one case fourteen storeys. Built of [[sandstone]] or [[granite]], Scottish tenements are usually three to five storeys in height, with two to four flats on each floor. (In contrast, industrial cities in England tended to favour \"[[Back-to-back houses|back-to-back]]\" [[terraced house|terrace]]s of [[brick]].) Scottish tenements are constructed in terraces, and each entrance within a block is referred to as a ''close'' or ''stair''\u2014both referring to the shared passageway to the individual flats. Flights of stairs and landings are generally designated common areas, and residents traditionally took turns to sweep clean the floors and, in [[Aberdeen]] in particular, took turns to make use of shared laundry facilities in the \"back green\" (garden or yard). It is now more common for cleaning of the common ways to be contracted out through a managing agent or \"factor\".\n\nIn [[Glasgow]], where Scotland's highest concentration of tenement dwellings can be found, the urban renewal projects of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s brought an end to the city's slums, which had primarily consisted of older tenements built in the early 19th century in which large [[extended families]] would live together in cramped conditions. They were replaced by high-rise blocks that, within a couple of decades, became notorious for crime and poverty. The [[Glasgow Corporation]] made many efforts to improve the situation, most successfully with the City Improvement Trust, which cleared the slums of the old town, replacing them with what they thought of as a traditional high street, which remains an imposing townscape. (The City Halls and the [[Cleland Testimonial]] were part of this scheme.) National government help was given following [[World War I]] when Housing Acts sought to provide \"homes fit for heroes\". Garden suburb areas, based on English models, such as [[Knightswood]], were set up. These proved too expensive, so a modern tenement, three stories high, slate roofed and built of reconstituted stone, was re-introduced and a [[slum clearance]] programme initiated to clear areas such as the [[Calton, Glasgow|Calton]] and the [[Garngad]].\n\nAfter [[Second World War|World War II]], more ambitious plans, known as the [[Bruce Plan]], were made for the complete evacuation of slums for modern mid-rise housing developments on the outskirts of the city. However, the central government refused to fund the plans, preferring instead to depopulate the city to a series of [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Towns.]]<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Williamson, E., Riches, A. & Higgs, M.

These housing estates, known as \"schemes\", came therefore to be widely regarded as unsuccessful; many, such as [[Castlemilk]], were just dormitories well away from the centre of the city with no amenities, such as shops and [[public houses]] (\"deserts with windows\", as [[Billy Connolly]] once put it). High-rise living too started off with bright ambition\u2014the Moss Heights, built in the 1950s, are still desirable\u2014but fell prey to later economic pressure. Many of the later tower blocks were poorly designed and cheaply built and their anonymity caused some social problems. The demolition of the tower blocks in order to build modern housing schemes has in some cases led to a re-interpretations of the tenement.\n\nIn 1970 a team from [[Strathclyde University]] demonstrated that the old tenements had been basically sound, and could be given new life with replumbing providing modern kitchens and bathrooms.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> The Corporation acted on this principle for the first time in 1973 at the ''Old Swan Corner'', [[Pollokshaws]]. Thereafter, ''Housing Action Areas'' were set up to renovate so-called slums. Later, privately owned tenements benefited from government help in \"stone cleaning\", revealing a honey-coloured sandstone behind the presumed \"grey\" tenemental facades. The policy of tenement demolition is now considered to have been short-sighted, wasteful and largely unsuccessful. Many of Glasgow's worst tenements were refurbished into desirable accommodation in the 1970s and 1980s<ref>[http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/springburn/spring066.htm Glasgow Digital Library: Demolition of tenements in Gourlay Street, 1975]</ref> and the policy of demolition is considered to have destroyed fine examples of a \"universally admired architectural\" style.<!-- <ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> --> The [[Glasgow Housing Association]] took ownership of the public housing stock from the city council on 7 March 2003, and has begun a \u00a396 million clearance and demolition programme to clear and demolish many of the high-rise flats.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090105180936/http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/News/Archives/2006/May/housingrevolutionannounced.htm Glasgow announces a revolution in house-building] Wednesday 31 May 2006.</ref>\n\n===United States===\n[[File:NewtonMA TheChestnutHill.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Chestnut Hill]], an 1899 apartment house in [[Newton, Massachusetts]]]]\n[[File:East 57th St Apartments.jpg|thumb|right|Apartment buildings lining the residential stretch of East 57th Street between First Avenue and Sutton Place in New York]]\n[[File:LowerEastSideTenements.JPG|thumb|right|[[Tenement]] buildings in [[Manhattan]]'s Lower East Side]]\n\nIn 1839, the first New York City [[tenement]] was built, and soon became breeding grounds for [[outlaw]]s, [[juvenile delinquent]]s, and [[organized crime]]. Tenements, or their slum landlords, were also known for their [[price gouging]] rent. ''How the Other Half Lives'' notes one tenement district:\n\n<blockquote>Blind Man's Alley bear its name for a reason. Until little more than a year ago its dark burrows harbored a colony of blind beggars, tenants of a blind landlord, old Daniel Murphy, whom every child in the ward knows, if he never heard of the President of the United States. \"Old Dan\" made a big fortune--he told me once four hundred thousand dollars-- out of his alley and the surrounding tenements, only to grow blind himself in extreme old age, sharing in the end the chief hardship of the wretched beings whose lot he had stubbornly refused to better that he might increase his wealth. Even when the [[Metropolitan Board of Health|Board of Health]] at last compelled him to repair and clean up the worst of the old buildings, under threat of driving out the tenants and locking the doors behind them, the work was accomplished against the old man's angry protests. He appeared in person before the Board to argue his case, and his argument was characteristic. \"I have made my will,\" he said. \"My monument stands waiting for me in Calvary. I stand on the very brink of the grave, blind and helpless, and now (here the pathos of the appeal was swept under in a burst of angry indignation) do you want me to build and get skinned, skinned? These people are not fit to live in a nice house. Let them go where they can, and let my house stand.\" In spite of the genuine anguish of the appeal, it was downright amusing to find that his anger was provoked less by the anticipated waste of luxury on his tenants than by distrust of his own kind, the builder. He knew intuitively what to expect. The result showed that Mr. Murphy had gauged his tenants correctly.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Riis|first1=Jacob A.|title=How the other half lives : studies among the tenements of New York|date=1890|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York|isbn=9111562986| pages=31\u201332|edition=1st|url=https://archive.org/stream/howotherhalflive00riis_1|accessdate=2 January 2017}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMany campaigners, such as [[Upton Sinclair]] and [[Jacob Riis]], pushed for reforms in tenement dwellings. As a result, the [[New York State Tenement House Act]] was passed in 1901 to improve the conditions. More improvements followed. In 1949, President [[Harry S. Truman]] signed the [[Housing Act of 1949]] to clean slums and reconstruct housing units for the poor.\n\n[[The Dakota]] (1884) was one of the first luxury apartment buildings in New York City. The majority, however, remained tenements.\n\nSome significant developments in architectural design of apartment buildings came out of the 1950s and '60s.  Among them were groundbreaking designs in the [[860-880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments]] (1951), [[New Century Guild]] (1961), [[Marina City]] (1964) and [[Lake Point Tower]] (1968).\n\nIn the United States, \"tenement\" is a label usually applied to the less expensive, more basic rental apartment buildings in older sections of large cities. Many of these apartment buildings are \"walk-ups\" without an elevator, and some have shared bathing facilities, though this is becoming less common. The slang term \"[[Dingbat (building)|dingbat]]\" is used to describe cheap urban apartment buildings from the 1950s and 1960s with unique and often wacky fa\u00e7ades to differentiate themselves within a full block of apartments. They are often built on stilts, and with parking underneath.\n\n====Property classes====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nIn the United States, properties are typically in one of four property classes, denoted by a letter grade. These grades are used to help [[investor]]s and [[real estate brokers]] speak a common language so they can understand a property's characteristics and condition quickly. They are as follows:\n\n''Class A'' properties are luxury units. They are usually less than 10 years old and are often new, upscale apartment buildings. Average rents are high, and they are generally in desirable geographic areas. [[White-collar worker]]s live in them and are usually renters by choice.\n\n''Class B'' properties can be 10 to 25 years old. They are generally well maintained and have a middle class tenant base of both white- and blue-collar workers. Some are renters by choice, and others by necessity.\n\n''Class C'' properties were built within the last 30 to 40 years. They generally have blue-collar and low- to moderate-income tenants, and the rents are below market. Many tenants are renters \"for life\". On the other hand, some of their tenants are just starting out and are likely to work their way up the rental scale as their income rises.\n\n''Class D'' properties house many [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] (government-subsidized) tenants. They are generally located in lower socioeconomic areas.\n\n===Canada===\nApartments were popular in Canada, particularly in urban centres like Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, and Hamilton in the 1950s to 1970s. By the 1980s, many multi-unit buildings were being constructed as [[condominium]]s instead of apartments\u2014both are now very common. In Toronto and Vancouver, high-rise apartments and condominiums have been spread around the city, giving even the major suburbs a skyline. The robustness of the condo markets in Toronto and Vancouver are based on the lack of land availability.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wang |first=Sissi |url=http://www.canadianbusiness.com/economy/the-latest-threat-to-the-condo-market-apartment-buildings-rise-again/ |title=The latest threat to the condo market: apartment buildings rise again |work=Canadian Business |date=8 July 2015 |accessdate=17 October 2015}}</ref> The average capitalization rate in the Greater Toronto Area for Q3 2015 hit its lowest level in 30 years: in Q3 2015 it stood at 3.75 per cent, down from 4.2 per cent in Q2 2015 and down almost 50 per cent from the 6.3 per cent posted in Q3 2010.<ref>{{cite web |last=DiGianfelice |first=Lorenzo |url=https://www.reminetwork.com/articles/gta-cap-rate-hits-new-benchmark-low/ |title=GTA cap rate hits new benchmark low |work=Canadian Apartment Magazine |date=9 October 2015 |accessdate=17 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Australia===\n[[File:Q1 Q Deck day.JPG|thumb|The skyline of the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in [[Queensland]] is dominated by apartments.]]\n[[File:Canterbury flats st kilda.jpg|thumb|right|The Canterbury in [[St Kilda, Victoria]] is one of the earliest surviving apartment buildings in Australia.]]\n[[File:(1)One Central Park.jpg|thumb|[[One Central Park]], Sydney, which features vertical [[Hanging garden (cultivation)|hanging gardens]] and sustainable [[green design]]]]\n\nApartment buildings in Australia are typically managed by a [[body corporate]] or \"owners corporation\" in which owners pay a monthly fee to provide for common maintenance and help cover future repair. Many apartments are owned through [[strata title]]. Due to legislation, Australian banks will either apply [[loan to value]] ratios of over 70 per cent for strata titles of less than 50 square metres, the [[Big four banks|big four Australian banks]] will not loan at all for strata titles of less than 30 square metres. These are usually classified as studio apartments or student accommodation. Australian legislation enforces a minimum 2.4{{Spaces|fig=}}m floor-ceiling height which differentiates apartment buildings from office buildings.\n\nIn Australia, apartment living is a popular lifestyle choice for [[DINKY]], [[yuppie]]s, [[university student]]s and more recently [[empty nester]]s, however, rising land values in the big cities in recent years has seen an increase in families living in apartments. In [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]] apartment living is sometimes not a matter of choice for the many socially disadvantaged people who often end up in public housing towers.\n\nAustralia has a relatively recent history in apartment buildings. [[Terrace houses]] were the early response to density development, though the majority of Australians lived in fully detached houses. Apartments of any kind were legislated against in the [[Parliament of Queensland]] as part of the [[Undue Subdivision of Land Prevention Act 1885]].\n\nThe earliest apartment buildings were in the major cities of [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]] as the response to fast rising land values\u2013both cities are home to the two oldest surviving apartment buildings in the country, Kingsclere in [[Potts Point]], and The Canterbury Flats in [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]]. [[Melbourne Mansions]] on [[Collins Street, Melbourne]] (now demolished), built in 1906 for mostly wealthy residents is believed by many to be the earliest. Today the oldest surviving self-contained apartment buildings are in the [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]] area including the Fawkner Mansions (1910), Majestic Mansions (1912 as a boarding house) and the Canterbury (1914\u2014the oldest surviving buildings contained flats).<ref>{{cite web |last=Peterson |first=Richard |url=http://www.skhs.org.au/SKHSbuildings/pdf%20files/21.pdf |title=The Canterbury (Flats) - 236 Canterbury Road, St Kilda West |work=A Place of Sensuous Resort: Buildings of St Kilda and Their People |publisher=St Kilda Historical Society |date=2005 |access-date=17 October 2015}}</ref> Kingsclere, built in 1912 is believed to be the earliest apartment building in Sydney and still survives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/heritagensw/win00/8_art.htm |title=High Rise has a past too |publisher=Heritage.nsw.gov.au |accessdate=25 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020628220428/http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/heritagensw/win00/8_art.htm |archive-date=28 June 2002 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the interwar years, apartment building continued in inner Melbourne (particularly in areas such as St Kilda and [[South Yarra]]), Sydney (particularly in areas such as [[Potts Point, New South Wales|Potts Point]], [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales|Darlinghust]] and [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]]) and in Brisbane (in areas such as [[New Farm, Queensland|New Farm]], [[Fortitude Valley, Queensland|Fortitude Valley]] and [[Spring Hill, Queensland|Spring Hill]]).\n\nPost-[[World War II]], with the [[Australian Dream]] apartment buildings went out of vogue and flats were seen as accommodation only for the poor. Walk-up flats (without a lift) of two to three storeys however were common in the middle suburbs of cities for lower income groups.\n\nThe main exceptions were Sydney and the [[Gold Coast, Queensland]] where apartment development continued for more than half a century. In Sydney a limited geography and highly sought after waterfront views ([[Sydney Harbour]] and beaches such as [[Bondi Beach, New South Wales|Bondi]]) made apartment living socially acceptable. While on the Gold Coast views of the ocean, proximity to the beach and a large tourist population made apartments a popular choice. Since the 1960s, these cities maintained much higher population densities than the rest of Australia through the acceptance of apartment buildings.\n\nIn other cities, apartment building was almost solely restricted to [[public housing]]. [[Public housing in Australia]] was common in the larger cities, particularly in Melbourne (by the [[Housing Commission of Victoria]]) where a huge number of hi-rise housing commission flats were built between the 1950s and 1970s by successive governments as part of an urban renewal program. Areas affected included [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]], [[Flemington, Victoria|Flemington]], [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]], [[Carlton, Victoria|Carlton]], [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]] and [[Prahran, Victoria|Prahran]]. Similar projects were run in Sydney's lower socio-economic areas like [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]].\n\nIn the 1980s, modern apartment buildings sprang up in riverside locations in [[Brisbane]] (along the [[Brisbane River]]) and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] (along the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]]).\n\nIn Melbourne, in the 1990s, a trend began for apartment buildings without the requirement of spectacular views. As a continuation of the [[gentrification]] of the inner city, a fashion became New York \"loft\" style apartments (see above) and a large stock of old warehouses and old abandoned office buildings in and around the central business district became the target of developers. The trend of [[adaptive reuse]] extended to conversion of old churches and schools. Similar warehouse conversions and gentrification began in Brisbane suburbs such as [[Teneriffe, Queensland]] and Fortitude Valley and in Sydney in areas such as [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]]. As supply of buildings for conversion ran out, reproduction and post modern style apartments followed. The popularity of these apartments also stimulated a boom in the construction of new hi-rise apartment buildings in inner cities. This was particularly the case in Melbourne which was fuelled by official planning policies ([[Postcode 3000]]), making the CBD the fastest growing, population wise in the country. Apartment building in the Melbourne metropolitan area has also escalated with the advent of the [[Melbourne 2030]] planning policy. [[Urban renewal]] areas like [[Melbourne Docklands|Docklands]], [[Southbank, Victoria|Southbank]], [[St Kilda Road]] and [[Port Melbourne]] are now predominantly apartments. There has also been a sharp increase in the number of student apartment buildings in areas such as Carlton in Melbourne.\n\nDespite their size, other smaller cities including [[Canberra]], [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Townsville]], [[Cairns]], [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], [[Wollongong, New South Wales|Wollongong]], [[Adelaide]] and [[Geelong]] have begun building apartments in the 2000s.\n\nToday, residential buildings [[Eureka Tower]] and [[Q1 (building)|Q1]] are the tallest in the country. In many cases, apartments in [[inner city]] areas of the major cities can cost much more than much larger houses in the outer suburbs.\n\nSome Australian cities, such as [[Gold Coast, Queensland]], are inhabited predominantly by apartment dwellers.\n\n===Yugoslavia===\nThe development of residential architecture in [[Yugoslavia]] during the period of [[socialism]] had its peak in the 1960s and 1970s. Significant progress in construction was accompanied by housing research directed towards finding the optimal urbanistic solutions for the newly formed lifestyle of the socialist society. The tendency was to \"pack\" as many [[residential]] units as possible into each building, almost up to the limits of the functional minimum, at the same time with the aim of setting a more humane pattern of living.<ref>Lojanica, V., Risti\u0107, J., Me\u0111o, V.

In the 6th century BCE, the [[mahajanapadas]] emerged in several parts of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nThe region was the historical centre of the [[Nanda Empire|Nanda]], [[Maurya]], [[Shunga Empire|Shunga]], [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] and [[Pala Empire|Pala]] empires that ruled much of the Indian sub-continent at their prime. In medieval India, it was incorporated into the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]], [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] and then the [[British Raj|British]] empire. After independence in 1947, the states joined the Indian Union and took their current form after the [[States Reorganisation Act]] of 1956. Today, they continue to face problems of overpopulation, environmental degradation and pervasive corruption despite significant economic and social progress.\n\nAfter the [[Kalinga War]] the Maurya king [[Ashoka]] sent emissaries to spread Buddhism across Asia. The famous university of Nalanda was in [[Bihar]]. Chinese travellers visited Buddhist and Hindu temples and libraries in the universities of Magadha Empire. The Emperor of Kalinga Mahameghavahana Aira [[Kharavela]] was one of the most powerful monarchs of ancient India. The [[Jain]] thirkhankar [[Mahaveer]] was born here and founded [[Jainism]].\n[[File:Konark Sun Temple Front view.jpg|thumb|right|[[Konark Sun Temple]] built by the [[Eastern Ganga dynasty]] is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in [[Odisha]]]]\nIslamic invasions in the 13th century resulted in the collapse of Hindu kings and most Buddhists, especially in [[East Bengal]], converted to Islam. East India including Bihar and West Bengal was part of the Mughal Empire in the 16th and 17th centuries. Odisha remained a powerful Hindu dynasty under the rule of Soma/Keshari Dynasty, Eastern Ganga Dynasty, Surya Dynasty till the end of the 16th century. The mighty [[Nalanda University]] existed at [[Nalanda]] which was destroyed by [[Bakhtiar Khilji]] during the 12th century and also defeated [[Sena Dynasty]]. [[Sher Shah Suri]], who became king of India after defeating [[Humayun]], founded the city of [[Patna]] on the ruins of ancient [[Pataliputra]].\n\n[[Islam]] arrived during the 6th\u20137th century AD and became dominant gradually since the early 13th century with the advent of Muslim rulers as well as [[Sunni]] missionaries such as [[Shah Jalal]] in the region. Later, Muslim rulers, starting from the [[Delhi Sultanate]] initiated the preaching of Islam by building mosques. From the 14th century onward, it was ruled by the [[Bengal Sultanate]], founded by king [[Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah]], beginning a period of the country's economic prosperity and military dominance over the regional empires, which was referred by the Europeans to as the richest country to trade with.<ref>Nanda, J.

The European traders established their trade centres in the famous ports of [[Balasore]], [[Pipili]], [[Palur]] in the Odisha Coast during the rule of the last independent Hindu king Gajapati Prataprudra Dev. The Portuguese were in Chittagong, Dutch in Chinsura, French in Pondicherry and the English founded [[Calcutta]]. In 1756, the [[British East India Company]] defeated the local Indian Muslim rulers in [[Plassey]] and established British Rule in the subcontinent. Its capital Calcutta grew into one of the world's greatest ports. Tea from Calcutta was off-loaded by American separatists in the [[American War of Independence]] in the 1770s. In the 19th century, Calcutta's traders and merchants traded with the rest of the British Empire, continental Europe, the United States and China. Indentured Indian labourers from Bihar, sailed to new homes in [[Fiji]], [[Mauritius]], [[Guyana]], [[Surinam]] and South Africa.\n\nIndia's independence movement had strong roots in East India. The feudal land system, established through the Permanent Settlement of Bengal, was unpopular among the peasant cultivators and the numerous agricultural labourers found all over Bihar and Bengal (Khetmazdoors). The Indian Rebellion of 1857 started in [[Bengal]]. British war propaganda asserted there were atrocities by the mutinous soldiers in the [[Black Hole of Calcutta]]. Eventually the British prevailed, and Calcutta remained capital of Britain's Asian dominions until 1911. During [[Gandhi]]'s independence movement, the Bihari village of Champaran was an important supporter of non-violent resistance. Great poets of the stature of [[Rabindranath Tagore]] championed the movement for self-rule.\n\nThe Partition also had its roots in undivided Eastern India. The [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] was founded in [[Dhaka]] in 1906. In the 1937 provincial elections, it came to power in Bengal in alliance with the [[Krishak Praja Party]]. in 1944, it gained an absolute majority in the Bengal Assembly, and Hussein Suhrawardy became the [[Chief Minister]]. After widespread communal violence during the [[Direct Action Day]] protests in [[Calcutta]], leading to further communal violence across [[British India]], the creation of Pakistan became inevitable. In 1947, further communal violence displaced millions as independence and [[Partition of India|partition]] of British India occurred. Some Bihari and Bengali Muslims fled to the newly created [[East Pakistan]]. Most East Bengal Hindus fled to India.\n\nThe 1950s saw industrial progress in East India. These were cut short with the conflict in neighbouring [[East Pakistan]] and by the [[Communist]] movement at home. In 1971, in the course of Bangladesh's independence struggle, millions of refugees poured into East India. From the turn of the 21st century, [[West Bengal]]'s economic growth has been rapid, and it now ranks as the fourth largest GDP contributor after Maharashtra, according to the [[List of Indian states by GDP]] and is now one of the fastest-growing economies among the states of India.\n\n[[Bihar]] and [[Odisha]] struggled with economic issues during the [[British Raj|British rule]] and in the beginning of [[History of the Republic of India|post independent India]]. But in recent years, these two states have shown impressive growth record and developed steadily. The economic boom since 2005 started to spread new malls, highways, airports and IT office complexes, but not evenly across the region. Jharkhand became a separate state on 15 November 2000. In the modern times, these states have seen rapid transformation and home to several mineral and metal based industries,<ref>{{cite web|author=Govt. of Odisha|url=http://orissaminerals.gov.in/website/StateIndustry.aspx?GL=sip&PL=3|title=Department of Steel and Mines, Government of Odisha, India|publisher=odisha.gov.in|accessdate=26 April 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616044015/http://www.orissaminerals.gov.in/website/StateIndustry.aspx?GL=sip&PL=3|archivedate=16 June 2016}}</ref> [[Talcher Super Thermal Power Station|coal based thermal powers units]], [[Paradip Refinery|oil refineries]], [[Paradip Port|ports]], textile industries and well established [[Education in Odisha|public and private educational institutes]].

One of the first great universities in recorded history was the ancient [[Nalanda University]] located in Bihar and another institute of higher learning was the ancient [[Puspagiri University]] recently discovered in Odisha.

The Muslims constitute a very large minority in West Bengal with 27% of the population and 17% in Bihar. Hindus form 94% of total population of Odisha. Christians are the largest minority in Odisha with 3% of the state population\n\n[[Durga]], [[Jagannath]], [[Shiva]] and [[Rama]] are particularly popular [[Hindu]] deities in this region.\n[[Durga]] and [[Kali]] are patron deities of Bengal and Mithila whereas [[Jagannath]] or [[Vishnu]] is patron [[god]] among [[Odia people]]. [[Rama]] and [[Hanuman]] are most revered in Bihar. [[Shiva]] is popular in all areas of eastern states.\n\nAmong tribals of the region [[Hinduism]] is the dominant religion. Some tribals also follow their indigenous religions (Sarana).\nThere are several places of pilgrimage for [[Hinduism]]. [[Puri]] in Odisha is one of the four holy City/Dham of Hindu religion and particularly known for [[Rath Yatra]] festival. [[Bhubaneswar]] is considered to be the \"City of Temples\".[[Konark]] houses an old [[sun temple]].\n\n[[Bihar Sharif]] is an important pilgrimage centre for Muslims all over Bihar.\n\nIn Bihar Village Harinagar Bajrang Bali temple is very famous for Hindu people.\n\n[[Dakshineswar Kali Temple]] is a famous historical [[Kali]] temple in [[West Bengal]]. [[Kalighat Kali Temple]] in [[Kolkata]] is the most important of all [[Shakti Peethas]] in India. [[Belur Math]] in [[Kolkata]] is the headquarters of the Ramkrishna Mission founded by [[Swami Vivekananda]].\n\nIn Bihar, [[Gaya, India|Gaya]] is known for temple for salvation of ancestors. Other places are Sultanganj in [[Bhagalpur]] and [[Vaidyanath Jyotirlinga]] in [[Deoghar]], Jharkhand. [[Bodh Gaya]] is the city sacred to [[Buddhism]]. There are also other cities sacred to [[Jainism|Jains]] in [[Bihar]] and Jharkhand.\n\n===Cuisine===\n\n'''West Bengal'''\n\n[[Bengali cuisine]] is a culinary style originating in [[Bengal]] which is now divided between the Indian state of [[West Bengal]] and today's [[Bangladesh]]. Other regions, such as [[Tripura]], and the [[Barak Valley]] region of [[Assam]] (in India) including some parts of  [[Jharkhand]] and [[Bihar]] also have large native [[Bengali people|Bengali]] populations and share this cuisine. With an emphasis on fish, vegetables and lentils served with rice as a staple diet, Bengali cuisine is known for its subtle (yet sometimes fiery) flavours, and its huge spread of confectioneries and desserts. It also has the only traditionally developed multi-course tradition from the [[Indian subcontinent]] that is analogous in structure to the modern ''[[service \u00e0 la russe]]'' style of [[French cuisine|French]] cuisine, with food served course-wise rather than all at once.\n\nBengali food has inherited a large number of influences, both foreign and pan-Indian, arising from a historical and strong trade links with many parts of the world. Bengal fell under the sway of various Turkic rulers from the early thirteenth century onwards, and was then governed by the British for two centuries (1757\u20131947).\n\n'''Odisha'''\n\n[[Odia cuisine]] refers to the cooking of the eastern [[India]]n state of [[Odisha]]. Foods from this area are rich and varied, while relying heavily on local ingredients. The flavours are usually subtle and delicately spiced, quite unlike the fiery curries typically associated with Indian cuisine. Fish and other seafood such as crab and shrimp are very popular. Chicken and mutton are also consumed, but somewhat occasionally. Only 6% of the population of Odisha is [[vegetarian]], and this is reflected in its cuisine. The oil base used is mostly [[mustard oil]], but in festivals [[ghee]] is used. ''[[Panch phutana]]'', a mix of cumin, mustard, fennel, fenugreek and kalonji (nigella) is widely used for tempering vegetables and dals, while ''[[garam masala]]'' (curry powder) and ''haladi'' (turmeric) are commonly used for non-vegetarian curries. [[Pakhala]], a dish made of rice, water, and yogurt, that is fermented overnight, is very popular in summer, particularly in the rural areas. Oriyas are very fond of sweets and no Oriya repast is considered complete without some dessert at the end. Festivals and fasts witness a cuisine without onion and garlic, whereas other days witness an aroma of garlic and onion paste in curries. One can find restaurants serving food without onion and garlic in major places like [[Puri]] and other coastal area, which is run by Brahmin owners.\n\nOdisha has a culinary tradition spanning centuries if not millennia. The kitchen of the famous [[Jagannath Temple (Puri)|Jagannath temple]] in Puri is reputed to be the largest in the world, with a thousand cooks, working around 752 wood-burning clay hearths called ''chulas'', to feed over 10,000 people everyday.\n\n<gallery>\nMacher Jhol.JPG|A traditional Bengali fish meal&nbsp;\u2013 Rice with Macher Jhol (Literally translated to \"Fish's gravy\")\nGreen Jackfruit & Potato Curry - Kolkata 2011-02-11 1000.JPG|Green jackfruit and potato curry, [[Kolkata]]\nFile:Bengali orange rasgulla.jpg| ''[[Kamalabhog]]'' Roshogolla from West Bengal\nFile:Bikalkar rasagola.gif| [[Bikalananda Kar|Bikali Kar]] Rasagola from Odisha\nChenapoda.jpg|[[Chhena Poda]] from Odisha\nRasmalai Secretlondon 09.jpg|[[Rasmalai]], a sweet dish popular in Odisha and West Bengal\nChenagaja.jpg|[[Chhena Gaja]] from Odisha\nBaleswari khaja pheni Oriya cuisine.jpg|[[Khaja]], a sweet dish popular in Bihar, Odisha and West Bengal\nChandrakanti.jpg|[[Chandrakanti]] sweet from Odisha\n</gallery>\n\n'''Bihar'''\n\n[[Bihari cuisine]] is eaten mainly in [[Bihar]], as well as regions where Bihari people have settled namely, [[Jharkhand]], eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]], [[Mauritius]], [[South Africa]], [[Fiji]], some cities of [[Pakistan]], [[Guyana]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Suriname]], [[Jamaica]] and the Caribbean.

It performed during marriage in the house of Bride and groom.\n\n'''Chhau dance (or Chau dance)''' is a form of tribal martial dance originating in [[Mayurbhanj]], the princely state of Odisha. It is also seen in the Indian states of West Bengal, Jharkhand and Odisha. There are three regional variations of the dance. Seraikella Chau was developed in [[Seraikella]], the administrative head of the [[Seraikela Kharsawan]] district of [[Jharkhand]]; Purulia Chau in [[Purulia district]] of West Bengal; and Mayurbhanj Chau in [[Mayurbhanj district]] of Odisha.\n\n''' [[Ghumura Dance]]'''\nArchaeological evidence shows<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The Heroic Dance Ghumura, Edited by Sanjay Kumar, Mahabir Sanskrutika, 2002</ref> cave paintings from the pre-historic period discovered by Gudahandi of [[Kalahandi]] and Yogi Matha of [[Nuapada district]] that represent the Ghumura and Damru, among other instruments. These paintings date to as early as 8000 BCE and from such painting the antiquity of musical instrument Ghumura and Damru can be imagined. The origin of Ghumura goes back to ancient times. There is a beautiful waterfall in the river valley of Indravati which was initially recognised by Chindak Naagas of Chakrakot.<ref>Epigraphica Indica, IX, p. 179</ref> Many believe that Ghumura dance originated from this river valley and gradually spread into the areas between Indravati and Mahanadi, indicating this dance form belongs to the 10th century CE.\n\nThe [[western Odisha]] has also great variety of dance forms unique to Odisha culture. The children's verses are known as \"Chhiollai\", \"Humobauli\" and \"Dauligit\". The adolescent poems are \"Sajani\", \"Chhata\", \"Daika\", \"Bhekani\". The eternal youth composes \"Rasarkeli\", \"Jaiphul\", \"Maila Jada\", \"Bayamana\", \"Gunchikuta\" and \"Dalkhai\". The work-man's poetry comprises \"Karma\" and \"Jhumer\", both pertaining to Lord Vishwakarma and the \"Karamashani\" goddess.

They are performed on a variety of occasions and their rhymes and rhythms change accordingly.\n\nBengali dance forms draw from folk traditions, especially those of the tribal groups, as well as from the broader Indian dance tradition. Dance forms of Bihar are another expression of rich traditions and ethnic identity. There are several folk dance forms that can keep one enthralled, such as dhobi nach, jhumarnach, manjhi, gondnach, jitiyanach, more morni, dom-domin, bhuiababa, rah baba, kathghorwa nach, jat jatin, launda nach, bamar nach, jharni, jhijhia, natua nach, bidapad nach, sohrai nach, and gond nach.\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|Rabindra Sangeet}}\n[[File:Rabindranath Tagore Ra-Tha seal initials.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Black-and-white close-up photograph of a piece of wood boldly painted in unmixed solid strokes of black and white in a stylised semblance to \"ro\" and \"tho\" from the Bengali syllabary.]]\n{{Culture of Bengal}}\nRabindra Sangeet, also known as Tagore Songs, are songs written and composed by [[Rabindranath Tagore]].

Many singers in [[West Bengal]] and [[Bangladesh]] base their entire careers on the singing of Tagore musical masterpieces.

However, Odissi songs were written even before the Odia language developed.

The existing musical tradition of Odisha, the cumulative experience of the last two thousand five hundred years if not more, can broadly be grouped under five categories such as: (1) Tribal Music, (2) Folk Music, (3) Light Music, (4) Light-Classical Music, (5) Classical Music, which need a short elucidations for better understanding the subject in all India context.\n\nThe tribal music as the title signifies is confined to the tribals living mainly in the hilly and jungle regions and sparsely in the coastal belt of Odisha. Odisha has the third largest concentration of tribes constituting about one fourth of the total population. They are distributed over 62 tribal communities.\n\nOdisha is the treasure house of Folk Songs which are sung on different festivals and specific occasions in their own enjoyment. Folk music in general is the expression of the ethos and mores of the folk communities. Of the bewildering variety of folk music of Odisha, mention may be made of Geeta, Balipuja Geeta, Kela Keluni Geeta, Dalkhai Geeta, Kendra Geeta, Jaiphula Geeta, Ghumura Geeta, Ghoda Nacha and Danda Nacha Geeta, Gopal Ugala and Osa-Parva-Geeta etc.\n\nBhajan, Janan, Oriya songs based on ragas, Rangila Chaupadi etc. are grouped under Light classical music, which forms an important segment of Oriya music. Sri Geetagovinda, Anirjukta Pravadha, Divya Manusi Prabandha, Chautisa, Chhanda, Chaupadi (now known as Odissi), Champu, Malasri, Sariman, nVyanjani, Chaturang, Tribhang, Kuduka Geeta, Laxana and Swaramalika are the various sub-forms, which individually or collectively constitute the traditional [[Odissi music]]. These sub-forms of the traditional Odissi music, can be categorised under the classical music of Odisha.\n\n==Sports==\n\nThe [[East Zone cricket team]] is a [[first class cricket|first-class]] [[cricket]] team that represents Eastern India in the [[Duleep Trophy]] and [[Deodhar Trophy]].

In the 6th century BCE, the [[mahajanapadas]] emerged in several parts of the Indian subcontinent.\n\nThe region was the historical centre of the [[Nanda Empire|Nanda]], [[Maurya]], [[Shunga Empire|Shunga]], [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] and [[Pala Empire|Pala]] empires that ruled much of the Indian sub-continent at their prime. In medieval India, it was incorporated into the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]], [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] and then the [[British Raj|British]] empire. After independence in 1947, the states joined the Indian Union and took their current form after the [[States Reorganisation Act]] of 1956. Today, they continue to face problems of overpopulation, environmental degradation and pervasive corruption despite significant economic and social progress.\n\nAfter the [[Kalinga War]] the Maurya king [[Ashoka]] sent emissaries to spread Buddhism across Asia. The famous university of Nalanda was in [[Bihar]]. Chinese travellers visited Buddhist and Hindu temples and libraries in the universities of Magadha Empire. The Emperor of Kalinga Mahameghavahana Aira [[Kharavela]] was one of the most powerful monarchs of ancient India. The [[Jain]] thirkhankar [[Mahaveer]] was born here and founded [[Jainism]].\n[[File:Konark Sun Temple Front view.jpg|thumb|right|[[Konark Sun Temple]] built by the [[Eastern Ganga dynasty]] is a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in [[Odisha]]]]\nIslamic invasions in the 13th century resulted in the collapse of Hindu kings and most Buddhists, especially in [[East Bengal]], converted to Islam. East India including Bihar and West Bengal was part of the Mughal Empire in the 16th and 17th centuries. Odisha remained a powerful Hindu dynasty under the rule of Soma/Keshari Dynasty, Eastern Ganga Dynasty, Surya Dynasty till the end of the 16th century. The mighty [[Nalanda University]] existed at [[Nalanda]] which was destroyed by [[Bakhtiar Khilji]] during the 12th century and also defeated [[Sena Dynasty]]. [[Sher Shah Suri]], who became king of India after defeating [[Humayun]], founded the city of [[Patna]] on the ruins of ancient [[Pataliputra]].\n\n[[Islam]] arrived during the 6th\u20137th century AD and became dominant gradually since the early 13th century with the advent of Muslim rulers as well as [[Sunni]] missionaries such as [[Shah Jalal]] in the region. Later, Muslim rulers, starting from the [[Delhi Sultanate]] initiated the preaching of Islam by building mosques. From the 14th century onward, it was ruled by the [[Bengal Sultanate]], founded by king [[Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah]], beginning a period of the country's economic prosperity and military dominance over the regional empires, which was referred by the Europeans to as the richest country to trade with.<ref>Nanda, J.

The European traders established their trade centres in the famous ports of [[Balasore]], [[Pipili]], [[Palur]] in the Odisha Coast during the rule of the last independent Hindu king Gajapati Prataprudra Dev. The Portuguese were in Chittagong, Dutch in Chinsura, French in Pondicherry and the English founded [[Calcutta]]. In 1756, the [[British East India Company]] defeated the local Indian Muslim rulers in [[Plassey]] and established British Rule in the subcontinent. Its capital Calcutta grew into one of the world's greatest ports. Tea from Calcutta was off-loaded by American separatists in the [[American War of Independence]] in the 1770s. In the 19th century, Calcutta's traders and merchants traded with the rest of the British Empire, continental Europe, the United States and China. Indentured Indian labourers from Bihar, sailed to new homes in [[Fiji]], [[Mauritius]], [[Guyana]], [[Surinam]] and South Africa.\n\nIndia's independence movement had strong roots in East India. The feudal land system, established through the Permanent Settlement of Bengal, was unpopular among the peasant cultivators and the numerous agricultural labourers found all over Bihar and Bengal (Khetmazdoors). The Indian Rebellion of 1857 started in [[Bengal]]. British war propaganda asserted there were atrocities by the mutinous soldiers in the [[Black Hole of Calcutta]]. Eventually the British prevailed, and Calcutta remained capital of Britain's Asian dominions until 1911. During [[Gandhi]]'s independence movement, the Bihari village of Champaran was an important supporter of non-violent resistance. Great poets of the stature of [[Rabindranath Tagore]] championed the movement for self-rule.\n\nThe Partition also had its roots in undivided Eastern India. The [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] was founded in [[Dhaka]] in 1906. In the 1937 provincial elections, it came to power in Bengal in alliance with the [[Krishak Praja Party]]. in 1944, it gained an absolute majority in the Bengal Assembly, and Hussein Suhrawardy became the [[Chief Minister]]. After widespread communal violence during the [[Direct Action Day]] protests in [[Calcutta]], leading to further communal violence across [[British India]], the creation of Pakistan became inevitable. In 1947, further communal violence displaced millions as independence and [[Partition of India|partition]] of British India occurred. Some Bihari and Bengali Muslims fled to the newly created [[East Pakistan]]. Most East Bengal Hindus fled to India.\n\nThe 1950s saw industrial progress in East India. These were cut short with the conflict in neighbouring [[East Pakistan]] and by the [[Communist]] movement at home. In 1971, in the course of Bangladesh's independence struggle, millions of refugees poured into East India. From the turn of the 21st century, [[West Bengal]]'s economic growth has been rapid, and it now ranks as the fourth largest GDP contributor after Maharashtra, according to the [[List of Indian states by GDP]] and is now one of the fastest-growing economies among the states of India.\n\n[[Bihar]] and [[Odisha]] struggled with economic issues during the [[British Raj|British rule]] and in the beginning of [[History of the Republic of India|post independent India]]. But in recent years, these two states have shown impressive growth record and developed steadily. The economic boom since 2005 started to spread new malls, highways, airports and IT office complexes, but not evenly across the region. Jharkhand became a separate state on 15 November 2000. In the modern times, these states have seen rapid transformation and home to several mineral and metal based industries,<ref>{{cite web|author=Govt. of Odisha|url=http://orissaminerals.gov.in/website/StateIndustry.aspx?GL=sip&PL=3|title=Department of Steel and Mines, Government of Odisha, India|publisher=odisha.gov.in|accessdate=26 April 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616044015/http://www.orissaminerals.gov.in/website/StateIndustry.aspx?GL=sip&PL=3|archivedate=16 June 2016}}</ref> [[Talcher Super Thermal Power Station|coal based thermal powers units]], [[Paradip Refinery|oil refineries]], [[Paradip Port|ports]], textile industries and well established [[Education in Odisha|public and private educational institutes]].

One of the first great universities in recorded history was the ancient [[Nalanda University]] located in Bihar and another institute of higher learning was the ancient [[Puspagiri University]] recently discovered in Odisha. Education in the eastern part of India has seen rapid transformation. Several new educational institutes have been established to cater the needs of students.

The Muslims constitute a very large minority in West Bengal with 27% of the population and 17% in Bihar. Hindus form 94% of total population of Odisha. Christians are the largest minority in Odisha with 3% of the state population\n\n[[Durga]], [[Jagannath]], [[Shiva]] and [[Rama]] are particularly popular [[Hindu]] deities in this region.\n[[Durga]] and [[Kali]] are patron deities of Bengal and Mithila whereas [[Jagannath]] or [[Vishnu]] is patron [[god]] among [[Odia people]]. [[Rama]] and [[Hanuman]] are most revered in Bihar. [[Shiva]] is popular in all areas of eastern states.\n\nAmong tribals of the region [[Hinduism]] is the dominant religion. Some tribals also follow their indigenous religions (Sarana).\nThere are several places of pilgrimage for [[Hinduism]]. [[Puri]] in Odisha is one of the four holy City/Dham of Hindu religion and particularly known for [[Rath Yatra]] festival. [[Bhubaneswar]] is considered to be the \"City of Temples\".[[Konark]] houses an old [[sun temple]].\n\n[[Bihar Sharif]] is an important pilgrimage centre for Muslims all over Bihar.\n\nIn Bihar Village Harinagar Bajrang Bali temple is very famous for Hindu people.\n\n[[Dakshineswar Kali Temple]] is a famous historical [[Kali]] temple in [[West Bengal]]. [[Kalighat Kali Temple]] in [[Kolkata]] is the most important of all [[Shakti Peethas]] in India. [[Belur Math]] in [[Kolkata]] is the headquarters of the Ramkrishna Mission founded by [[Swami Vivekananda]].\n\nIn Bihar, [[Gaya, India|Gaya]] is known for temple for salvation of ancestors. Other places are Sultanganj in [[Bhagalpur]] and [[Vaidyanath Jyotirlinga]] in [[Deoghar]], Jharkhand. [[Bodh Gaya]] is the city sacred to [[Buddhism]]. There are also other cities sacred to [[Jainism|Jains]] in [[Bihar]] and Jharkhand.\n\n===Cuisine===\n\n'''West Bengal'''\n\n[[Bengali cuisine]] is a culinary style originating in [[Bengal]] which is now divided between the Indian state of [[West Bengal]] and today's [[Bangladesh]]. Other regions, such as [[Tripura]], and the [[Barak Valley]] region of [[Assam]] (in India) including some parts of  [[Jharkhand]] and [[Bihar]] also have large native [[Bengali people|Bengali]] populations and share this cuisine. With an emphasis on fish, vegetables and lentils served with rice as a staple diet, Bengali cuisine is known for its subtle (yet sometimes fiery) flavours, and its huge spread of confectioneries and desserts. It also has the only traditionally developed multi-course tradition from the [[Indian subcontinent]] that is analogous in structure to the modern ''[[service \u00e0 la russe]]'' style of [[French cuisine|French]] cuisine, with food served course-wise rather than all at once.\n\nBengali food has inherited a large number of influences, both foreign and pan-Indian, arising from a historical and strong trade links with many parts of the world. Bengal fell under the sway of various Turkic rulers from the early thirteenth century onwards, and was then governed by the British for two centuries (1757\u20131947).\n\n'''Odisha'''\n\n[[Odia cuisine]] refers to the cooking of the eastern [[India]]n state of [[Odisha]]. Foods from this area are rich and varied, while relying heavily on local ingredients. The flavours are usually subtle and delicately spiced, quite unlike the fiery curries typically associated with Indian cuisine. Fish and other seafood such as crab and shrimp are very popular. Chicken and mutton are also consumed, but somewhat occasionally. Only 6% of the population of Odisha is [[vegetarian]], and this is reflected in its cuisine. The oil base used is mostly [[mustard oil]], but in festivals [[ghee]] is used. ''[[Panch phutana]]'', a mix of cumin, mustard, fennel, fenugreek and kalonji (nigella) is widely used for tempering vegetables and dals, while ''[[garam masala]]'' (curry powder) and ''haladi'' (turmeric) are commonly used for non-vegetarian curries. [[Pakhala]], a dish made of rice, water, and yogurt, that is fermented overnight, is very popular in summer, particularly in the rural areas. Oriyas are very fond of sweets and no Oriya repast is considered complete without some dessert at the end. Festivals and fasts witness a cuisine without onion and garlic, whereas other days witness an aroma of garlic and onion paste in curries. One can find restaurants serving food without onion and garlic in major places like [[Puri]] and other coastal area, which is run by Brahmin owners.\n\nOdisha has a culinary tradition spanning centuries if not millennia. The kitchen of the famous [[Jagannath Temple (Puri)|Jagannath temple]] in Puri is reputed to be the largest in the world, with a thousand cooks, working around 752 wood-burning clay hearths called ''chulas'', to feed over 10,000 people everyday.\n\n<gallery>\nMacher Jhol.JPG|A traditional Bengali fish meal&nbsp;\u2013 Rice with Macher Jhol (Literally translated to \"Fish's gravy\")\nGreen Jackfruit & Potato Curry - Kolkata 2011-02-11 1000.JPG|Green jackfruit and potato curry, [[Kolkata]]\nFile:Bengali orange rasgulla.jpg| ''[[Kamalabhog]]'' Roshogolla from West Bengal\nFile:Bikalkar rasagola.gif| [[Bikalananda Kar|Bikali Kar]] Rasagola from Odisha\nChenapoda.jpg|[[Chhena Poda]] from Odisha\nRasmalai Secretlondon 09.jpg|[[Rasmalai]], a sweet dish popular in Odisha and West Bengal\nChenagaja.jpg|[[Chhena Gaja]] from Odisha\nBaleswari khaja pheni Oriya cuisine.jpg|[[Khaja]], a sweet dish popular in Bihar, Odisha and West Bengal\nChandrakanti.jpg|[[Chandrakanti]] sweet from Odisha\n</gallery>\n\n'''Bihar'''\n\n[[Bihari cuisine]] is eaten mainly in [[Bihar]], as well as regions where Bihari people have settled namely, [[Jharkhand]], eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]], [[Mauritius]], [[South Africa]], [[Fiji]], some cities of [[Pakistan]], [[Guyana]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Suriname]], [[Jamaica]] and the Caribbean.

It performed during marriage in the house of Bride and groom.\n\n'''Chhau dance (or Chau dance)''' is a form of tribal martial dance originating in [[Mayurbhanj]], the princely state of Odisha. It is also seen in the Indian states of West Bengal, Jharkhand and Odisha. There are three regional variations of the dance. Seraikella Chau was developed in [[Seraikella]], the administrative head of the [[Seraikela Kharsawan]] district of [[Jharkhand]]; Purulia Chau in [[Purulia district]] of West Bengal; and Mayurbhanj Chau in [[Mayurbhanj district]] of Odisha.\n\n''' [[Ghumura Dance]]'''\nArchaeological evidence shows<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The Heroic Dance Ghumura, Edited by Sanjay Kumar, Mahabir Sanskrutika, 2002</ref> cave paintings from the pre-historic period discovered by Gudahandi of [[Kalahandi]] and Yogi Matha of [[Nuapada district]] that represent the Ghumura and Damru, among other instruments. These paintings date to as early as 8000 BCE and from such painting the antiquity of musical instrument Ghumura and Damru can be imagined. The origin of Ghumura goes back to ancient times. There is a beautiful waterfall in the river valley of Indravati which was initially recognised by Chindak Naagas of Chakrakot.<ref>Epigraphica Indica, IX, p. 179</ref> Many believe that Ghumura dance originated from this river valley and gradually spread into the areas between Indravati and Mahanadi, indicating this dance form belongs to the 10th century CE.\n\nThe [[western Odisha]] has also great variety of dance forms unique to Odisha culture. The children's verses are known as \"Chhiollai\", \"Humobauli\" and \"Dauligit\". The adolescent poems are \"Sajani\", \"Chhata\", \"Daika\", \"Bhekani\". The eternal youth composes \"Rasarkeli\", \"Jaiphul\", \"Maila Jada\", \"Bayamana\", \"Gunchikuta\" and \"Dalkhai\". The work-man's poetry comprises \"Karma\" and \"Jhumer\", both pertaining to Lord Vishwakarma and the \"Karamashani\" goddess.

They are performed on a variety of occasions and their rhymes and rhythms change accordingly.\n\nBengali dance forms draw from folk traditions, especially those of the tribal groups, as well as from the broader Indian dance tradition. Dance forms of Bihar are another expression of rich traditions and ethnic identity. There are several folk dance forms that can keep one enthralled, such as dhobi nach, jhumarnach, manjhi, gondnach, jitiyanach, more morni, dom-domin, bhuiababa, rah baba, kathghorwa nach, jat jatin, launda nach, bamar nach, jharni, jhijhia, natua nach, bidapad nach, sohrai nach, and gond nach.\n\n==Music==\n{{Main|Rabindra Sangeet}}\n[[File:Rabindranath Tagore Ra-Tha seal initials.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Black-and-white close-up photograph of a piece of wood boldly painted in unmixed solid strokes of black and white in a stylised semblance to \"ro\" and \"tho\" from the Bengali syllabary.]]\n{{Culture of Bengal}}\nRabindra Sangeet, also known as Tagore Songs, are songs written and composed by [[Rabindranath Tagore]].

Many singers in [[West Bengal]] and [[Bangladesh]] base their entire careers on the singing of Tagore musical masterpieces.

However, Odissi songs were written even before the Odia language developed.

The existing musical tradition of Odisha, the cumulative experience of the last two thousand five hundred years if not more, can broadly be grouped under five categories such as: (1) Tribal Music, (2) Folk Music, (3) Light Music, (4) Light-Classical Music, (5) Classical Music, which need a short elucidations for better understanding the subject in all India context.\n\nThe tribal music as the title signifies is confined to the tribals living mainly in the hilly and jungle regions and sparsely in the coastal belt of Odisha. Odisha has the third largest concentration of tribes constituting about one fourth of the total population. They are distributed over 62 tribal communities.\n\nOdisha is the treasure house of Folk Songs which are sung on different festivals and specific occasions in their own enjoyment. Folk music in general is the expression of the ethos and mores of the folk communities. Of the bewildering variety of folk music of Odisha, mention may be made of Geeta, Balipuja Geeta, Kela Keluni Geeta, Dalkhai Geeta, Kendra Geeta, Jaiphula Geeta, Ghumura Geeta, Ghoda Nacha and Danda Nacha Geeta, Gopal Ugala and Osa-Parva-Geeta etc.\n\nBhajan, Janan, Oriya songs based on ragas, Rangila Chaupadi etc. are grouped under Light classical music, which forms an important segment of Oriya music. Sri Geetagovinda, Anirjukta Pravadha, Divya Manusi Prabandha, Chautisa, Chhanda, Chaupadi (now known as Odissi), Champu, Malasri, Sariman, nVyanjani, Chaturang, Tribhang, Kuduka Geeta, Laxana and Swaramalika are the various sub-forms, which individually or collectively constitute the traditional [[Odissi music]]. These sub-forms of the traditional Odissi music, can be categorised under the classical music of Odisha.\n\n==Sports==\n\nThe [[East Zone cricket team]] is a [[first class cricket|first-class]] [[cricket]] team that represents Eastern India in the [[Duleep Trophy]] and [[Deodhar Trophy]].

{"title_page": "Candle", "text_new": "{{Other uses}} for eating not tockic \n[[File:LA2 Skultuna kontorsljusstake.jpg|thumb|upright|A candle in a candle stick]]\n\nA '''candle''' is an ignitable [[candle wick|wick]] embedded in [[wax]], or another flammable solid substance such as [[tallow]], that provides [[light]], and in some cases, a [[Aroma compound|fragrance]].  A candle can also provide [[heat]] or a method of keeping [[time]].\n\nA person who makes candles is traditionally known as a [[chandlery|chandler]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/chandler|title=Chandler |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-19}}</ref> Various devices have been invented to hold candles, from simple tabletop [[candlestick|candlesticks, also known as candle holders,]] to elaborate [[candelabra]] and  [[chandelier]]s.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/chandelier |title=chandelier |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-19}}</ref>\n\nFor a candle to burn, a heat source (commonly a naked flame from a [[match]] or [[lighter]]) is used to light the candle's wick, which melts and [[vaporizes]] a small amount of fuel (the wax). Once vaporized, the fuel combines with [[oxygen]] in the atmosphere to ignite and form a constant [[flame]]. This flame provides sufficient heat to keep the candle burning via a self-sustaining chain of events: the heat of the flame melts the top of the mass of solid fuel; the liquefied fuel then moves upward through the wick via [[capillary action]]; the liquefied fuel finally vaporizes to burn within the candle's flame.\n\nAs the fuel (wax) is melted and burned, the candle becomes shorter. Portions of the wick that are not emitting vaporized fuel are consumed in the flame. The incineration of the wick limits the length of the exposed portion of the wick, thus maintaining a constant burning temperature and rate of fuel consumption. Some wicks require regular trimming with scissors (or a specialized wick trimmer), usually to about one-quarter inch (~0.7&nbsp;cm), to promote slower, steady burning, and also to prevent smoking. Special candle-scissors called \"[[Candle snuffer|snuffers]]\" were produced for this purpose in the 20th century and were often combined with an extinguisher. In modern candles, the wick is constructed so that it curves over as it burns.  This ensures that the end of the wick gets oxygen and is then consumed by [[fire]]\u2014a self-trimming wick.<ref>[http://www.eca-candles.com/design.php?rubrik=29&topnav=6&sprach_id=en&SID=ksqhyfiz European Candle Association FAQ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113154928/http://www.eca-candles.com/design.php?rubrik=29&topnav=6&sprach_id=en&SID=ksqhyfiz |date=2012-01-13 }}.</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word candle comes from Middle English ''candel'', from Old English and from Anglo-Norman ''candele'', both from Latin ''cand\u0113la'', from ''cand\u0113re'', to shine.<ref name=Farlex>{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/candle |title=Candle |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-19}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of candle making}}\n[[File:Roman oil lamp.jpg|thumb|Roman oil lamp]]\nPrior to the candle, people used [[oil lamp]]s in which a lit wick rested in a container of liquid oil.

Commercial wicks are made from braided cotton.  The wick's [[capillary action|capillarity]] determines the rate at which the melted hydrocarbon is conveyed to the flame.  If the capillarity is too great, the molten wax streams down the side of the candle.  Wicks are often infused with a variety of [[chemical]]s to modify their burning characteristics.  For example, it is usually desirable that the wick not glow after the flame is extinguished.

The blue color is due to [[chemiluminescence]], while the visible yellow color is due to radiative emission from hot [[soot]] particles.  The soot is formed through a series of complex chemical reactions, leading from the fuel molecule through molecular growth, until multi-carbon ring compounds are formed.

It is located around the base of the wick where there is insufficient oxygen for fuel to burn.  Temperatures are around {{convert|600|C|F}}.\n* Zone II - this is the ''blue zone'' which surrounds the base of the flame.  Here the supply of oxygen is plentiful, and the fuel burns clean and blue.

[[Pyrolysis]] takes place here.  Temperature is around {{convert|1000|C|F}}\n*Zone IV - the ''middle'' or ''luminous zone'' is yellow/ white and is located above the dark zone.  It is the brightest zone, but not the hottest.  It is an oxygen-depleted zone with insufficient oxygen to burn all of the wax vapor rising from below it resulting in only partial combustion. The zone also contains unburnt carbon particles. Temperature is around {{convert|1200|C|F}}.\n* Zone V - The non-luminous  ''outer zone'' or ''veil'' surrounds Zone IV.  Here the flame is at its hottest, at around {{convert|1400|C|F}}, and complete combustion occurs. It is light blue in color though most of it is invisible.<ref>{{cite web|work=Ohio State University|title=FTIR STUDY OF COMBUSTION SPECIES IN SEVERAL REGIONS OF A CANDLE FLAME|url=https://kb.osu.edu/handle/1811/55436|accessdate=26 January 2019|author=Allen R.

The best way to avoid getting burned from splashed wax is to use a [[candle snuffer]] instead of blowing on the flame. A candle snuffer is usually a small metal cup on the end of a long handle. Placing the snuffer over the flame cuts off the oxygen supply. Snuffers were common in the home when candles were the main source of lighting before electric lights were available.  Ornate snuffers, often combined with a taper for lighting, are still found in those churches which regularly use large candles.\n\nGlass candle-holders are sometimes cracked by thermal shock from the candle flame, particularly when the candle burns down to the end. When burning candles in glass holders or jars, users should avoid lighting candles with chipped or cracked containers, and stop use once 1/2&nbsp;inch or less of wax remains.\n\nA former worry regarding the safety of candles was that a [[lead]] core was used in the wicks to keep them upright in container candles. Without a stiff core, the wicks of a container candle could sag and drown in the deep wax pool. Concerns rose that the lead in these wicks would vaporize during the burning process, releasing lead vapors \u2014 a known health and developmental hazard. Lead core wicks have not been common since the 1970s. Today, most metal-cored wicks use [[zinc]] or a zinc [[alloy]], which has become the industry standard. Wicks made from specially treated paper and cotton are also available.\n\n==Regulation==\nInternational markets have developed a range of standards and [[regulation]]s to ensure compliance, while maintaining and improving [[safety]], including:\n* Europe: GPSD, EN 15493, EN 15494, EN 15426, EN 14059, [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH]], RAL-GZ 041 Candles (Germany), French Decree 91-1175\n* United States: ASTM F2058, ASTM F2179, ASTM F2417, ASTM F2601, ASTM F2326, [[California Proposition 65 (1986)|California Proposition 65]], CONEG\n* China: QB/T 2119 Basic Candle, QB/T 2902 Art Candle, QB/T 2903 Jar Candle, GB/T 22256 Jelly Candle\n\n==Accessories==\n[[File:Wick-Trimmer.jpg|thumb|Wick-trimmer]]\n===Candle holders===\nDecorative candleholders, especially those shaped as a pedestal, are called [[candlestick]]s; if multiple candle tapers are held, the term ''candelabrum'' is also used. The root form of ''[[chandelier]]'' is from the word for candle, but now usually refers to an electric fixture. The word ''chandelier'' is sometimes now used to describe a hanging fixture designed to hold multiple tapers.\n\nMany candle holders use a friction-tight socket to keep the candle upright. In this case, a candle that is slightly too wide will not fit in the holder, and a candle that is slightly too narrow will wobble. Candles that are too big can be trimmed to fit with a knife; candles that are too small can be fitted with aluminium foil. Traditionally, the candle and candle holders were made in the same place, so they were appropriately sized, but [[common market|international trade]] has combined the modern candle with existing holders, which makes the ill-fitting candle more common. This friction tight socket is only needed for the federals and the tapers. For [[tea light]] candles, there is a variety of candle holders, including small glass holders and elaborate multi-candle stands. The same is true for [[votive candle|votives]]. Wall sconces are available for tea light and votive candles. For pillar-type candles, the assortment of candle holders is broad. A fireproof plate, such as a glass plate or small mirror, can be a candle holder for a pillar-style candle. A pedestal of any kind, with the appropriate-sized fireproof top, is another option. A large glass bowl with a large flat bottom and tall mostly vertical curved sides is called a hurricane. The pillar-style candle is placed at the bottom center of the hurricane. A hurricane on a pedestal is sometimes sold as a unit.\n\nA [[bob\u00e8che]] is a drip-catching ring, which may also be affixed to a candle holder, or used independently of one. Bob\u00e8ches can range from ornate metal or glass to simple plastic, cardboard, or wax paper. Use of paper or plastic bob\u00e8ches is common at events where candles are distributed to a crowd or audience, such as Christmas carolers or people at other concerts/festivals.\n\n===Candle followers===\nThese are glass or metal tubes with an internal stricture partway along, which sit around the top of a lit candle. As the candle burns, the wax melts and the follower holds the melted wax in, whilst the stricture rests on the topmost solid portion of wax. Candle followers are often deliberately heavy or weighted to ensure they move down as the candle burns lower, maintaining a seal and preventing wax escape. The purpose of a candle follower is threefold:\n* To contain the melted wax, making the candle more efficient, avoiding mess, and producing a more even burn.\n* As a decoration, either due to the ornate nature of the device, or (in the case of a glass follower) through light dispersion or colouration.\n* If necessary, to shield the flame from wind.\n\nCandle followers are often found in churches on [[altar candle]]s.\n\n===Candle snuffers===\n{{main|Candle snuffer}}\nCandle snuffers are instruments used to extinguish burning candles by smothering the flame with a small metal cup that is suspended from a long handle, and thus depriving it of oxygen. An older meaning refers to a scissor-like tool used to trim the wick of a candle. With skill, this could be done without extinguishing the flame. The instrument now known as a candle snuffer was formerly called an \"extinguisher\" or \"douter\".\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Candle-making]]\n* [[Candle warmer]]\n* [[Candelabra]]\n* [[Julleuchter]]\n* [[Outdoor candle]]\n* [[Rushlight]]\n* [[Singing candle]]\n* [[Tealight]]\n* [[Trick candles]]\n* [[Trudon]]\n* [[Unity candle]]\n* [[Yahrzeit candle]]{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote|Candles}}\n{{CE1913 poster|Candles}}\n* {{Commons category-inline|Candles}}\n* [http://www.candles.org/ National Candle Association] of the [[United States|U.S.]]\n* [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14474 The Chemical History of a Candle] by Michael Faraday\n* [http://www.europecandles.org/ Association of European Candlemakers(AECM)]\n* [http://www.eca-candles.eu/ European Candle Association (ECA)]\n* [http://www.alafave.org/ Latin American Candle Manufacturers Association (ALAFAVE)]\n* [https://www.osmology.co/blog/candle-safety/ Guide To Candle Safety At Home - Osmology]\n\n{{Artificial light sources}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Candles| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses}}\n[[File:LA2 Skultuna kontorsljusstake.jpg|thumb|upright|A candle in a candle stick]]\n\nA '''candle''' is an ignitable [[candle wick|wick]] embedded in [[wax]], or another flammable solid substance such as [[tallow]], that provides [[light]], and in some cases, a [[Aroma compound|fragrance]].

Once vaporized, the fuel combines with [[oxygen]] in the atmosphere to ignite and form a constant [[flame]]. This flame provides sufficient heat to keep the candle burning via a self-sustaining chain of events: the heat of the flame melts the top of the mass of solid fuel; the liquefied fuel then moves upward through the wick via [[capillary action]]; the liquefied fuel finally vaporizes to burn within the candle's flame.\n\nAs the fuel (wax) is melted and burned, the candle becomes shorter. Portions of the wick that are not emitting vaporized fuel are consumed in the flame. The incineration of the wick limits the length of the exposed portion of the wick, thus maintaining a constant burning temperature and rate of fuel consumption. Some wicks require regular trimming with scissors (or a specialized wick trimmer), usually to about one-quarter inch (~0.7&nbsp;cm), to promote slower, steady burning, and also to prevent smoking. Special candle-scissors called \"[[Candle snuffer|snuffers]]\" were produced for this purpose in the 20th century and were often combined with an extinguisher. In modern candles, the wick is constructed so that it curves over as it burns.  This ensures that the end of the wick gets oxygen and is then consumed by [[fire]]\u2014a self-trimming wick.<ref>[http://www.eca-candles.com/design.php?rubrik=29&topnav=6&sprach_id=en&SID=ksqhyfiz European Candle Association FAQ] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113154928/http://www.eca-candles.com/design.php?rubrik=29&topnav=6&sprach_id=en&SID=ksqhyfiz |date=2012-01-13 }}.</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word candle comes from Middle English ''candel'', from Old English and from Anglo-Norman ''candele'', both from Latin ''cand\u0113la'', from ''cand\u0113re'', to shine.<ref name=Farlex>{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/candle |title=Candle |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-19}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of candle making}}\n[[File:Roman oil lamp.jpg|thumb|Roman oil lamp]]\nPrior to the candle, people used [[oil lamp]]s in which a lit wick rested in a container of liquid oil.

Important characteristics of the wick include diameter, stiffness, [[Fireproofing|fire-resistance]], and tethering.\n\nA candle wick is a piece of string or cord that holds the flame of a candle.  Commercial wicks are made from braided cotton.  The wick's [[capillary action|capillarity]] determines the rate at which the melted hydrocarbon is conveyed to the flame.  If the capillarity is too great, the molten wax streams down the side of the candle.  Wicks are often infused with a variety of [[chemical]]s to modify their burning characteristics.  For example, it is usually desirable that the wick not glow after the flame is extinguished.  Typical agents are [[ammonium nitrate]] and [[ammonium sulfate]].<ref name= Ullmann/>\n\n==Characteristics==\n\n===Light===\n[[File:candles.jpg|thumb|A room lit by the glow of many candles]]\n\nBased on measurements of a taper-type, paraffin wax candle, a modern candle typically burns at a steady rate of about 0.1&nbsp;g/min, releasing heat at roughly 80&nbsp;W.<ref name=Hamins>{{cite journal |last1=Hamins |first1=Anthony |last2=Bundy |first2=Matthew |last3=Dillon |first3=Scott E. |date=November 2005 |title=Characterization of Candle Flames |journal=Journal of Fire Protection Engineering |volume=15 |issue= 4|page=277 |publisher= |doi=10.1177/1042391505053163 |url=https://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=101159  |format=PDF|citeseerx=10.1.1.548.3798 }}</ref> The light produced is about 13 [[lumen (unit)|lumens]], for a [[luminous efficacy]] of about 0.16 lumens per watt (luminous efficacy of a source) \u2013 almost a hundred times lower than an [[incandescent light bulb]].\n\nThe [[luminous intensity]] of a typical candle is approximately one [[candela]].

The blue color is due to [[chemiluminescence]], while the visible yellow color is due to radiative emission from hot [[soot]] particles.  The soot is formed through a series of complex chemical reactions, leading from the fuel molecule through molecular growth, until multi-carbon ring compounds are formed.  The thermal structure of a flame is complex, hundreds of degrees over very short distances leading to extremely steep temperature gradients. On average, the flame temperature is about {{convert|1000|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/phy03.sci.phys.matter.onfire/on-fire/|title=On Fire \u2013 Background Essay|website=PBS LearningMedia|publisher=[[PBS]] and [[WGBH Educational Foundation]]|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}</ref> The [[color temperature]] is approximately 1000 K.\n\n===Candle flame===\n[[File:Anatomy of a candle flame.svg|thumb|Five zones of a standard domestic candle flame]]\n\nA candle flame is formed because wax vaporizes on burning.

It is located around the base of the wick where there is insufficient oxygen for fuel to burn.  Temperatures are around {{convert|600|C|F}}.\n* Zone II - this is the ''blue zone'' which surrounds the base of the flame.  Here the supply of oxygen is plentiful, and the fuel burns clean and blue.  It is heat from this zone which causes the wax to melt. Temperatures are around {{convert|800|C|F}}\n* Zone III - the ''dark zone'' is a region directly above the wick containing unburnt wax.  [[Pyrolysis]] takes place here.  Temperature is around {{convert|1000|C|F}}\n*Zone IV - the ''middle'' or ''luminous zone'' is yellow/ white and is located above the dark zone.  It is the brightest zone, but not the hottest.  It is an oxygen-depleted zone with insufficient oxygen to burn all of the wax vapor rising from below it resulting in only partial combustion. The zone also contains unburnt carbon particles. Temperature is around {{convert|1200|C|F}}.\n* Zone V - The non-luminous  ''outer zone'' or ''veil'' surrounds Zone IV.  Here the flame is at its hottest, at around {{convert|1400|C|F}}, and complete combustion occurs. It is light blue in color though most of it is invisible.<ref>{{cite web|work=Ohio State University|title=FTIR STUDY OF COMBUSTION SPECIES IN SEVERAL REGIONS OF A CANDLE FLAME|url=https://kb.osu.edu/handle/1811/55436|accessdate=26 January 2019|author=Allen R.

The best way to avoid getting burned from splashed wax is to use a [[candle snuffer]] instead of blowing on the flame. A candle snuffer is usually a small metal cup on the end of a long handle. Placing the snuffer over the flame cuts off the oxygen supply. Snuffers were common in the home when candles were the main source of lighting before electric lights were available.  Ornate snuffers, often combined with a taper for lighting, are still found in those churches which regularly use large candles.\n\nGlass candle-holders are sometimes cracked by thermal shock from the candle flame, particularly when the candle burns down to the end. When burning candles in glass holders or jars, users should avoid lighting candles with chipped or cracked containers, and stop use once 1/2&nbsp;inch or less of wax remains.\n\nA former worry regarding the safety of candles was that a [[lead]] core was used in the wicks to keep them upright in container candles. Without a stiff core, the wicks of a container candle could sag and drown in the deep wax pool. Concerns rose that the lead in these wicks would vaporize during the burning process, releasing lead vapors \u2014 a known health and developmental hazard. Lead core wicks have not been common since the 1970s. Today, most metal-cored wicks use [[zinc]] or a zinc [[alloy]], which has become the industry standard. Wicks made from specially treated paper and cotton are also available.\n\n==Regulation==\nInternational markets have developed a range of standards and [[regulation]]s to ensure compliance, while maintaining and improving [[safety]], including:\n* Europe: GPSD, EN 15493, EN 15494, EN 15426, EN 14059, [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH]], RAL-GZ 041 Candles (Germany), French Decree 91-1175\n* United States: ASTM F2058, ASTM F2179, ASTM F2417, ASTM F2601, ASTM F2326, [[California Proposition 65 (1986)|California Proposition 65]], CONEG\n* China: QB/T 2119 Basic Candle, QB/T 2902 Art Candle, QB/T 2903 Jar Candle, GB/T 22256 Jelly Candle\n\n==Accessories==\n[[File:Wick-Trimmer.jpg|thumb|Wick-trimmer]]\n===Candle holders===\nDecorative candleholders, especially those shaped as a pedestal, are called [[candlestick]]s; if multiple candle tapers are held, the term ''candelabrum'' is also used. The root form of ''[[chandelier]]'' is from the word for candle, but now usually refers to an electric fixture. The word ''chandelier'' is sometimes now used to describe a hanging fixture designed to hold multiple tapers.\n\nMany candle holders use a friction-tight socket to keep the candle upright. In this case, a candle that is slightly too wide will not fit in the holder, and a candle that is slightly too narrow will wobble. Candles that are too big can be trimmed to fit with a knife; candles that are too small can be fitted with aluminium foil. Traditionally, the candle and candle holders were made in the same place, so they were appropriately sized, but [[common market|international trade]] has combined the modern candle with existing holders, which makes the ill-fitting candle more common. This friction tight socket is only needed for the federals and the tapers. For [[tea light]] candles, there is a variety of candle holders, including small glass holders and elaborate multi-candle stands. The same is true for [[votive candle|votives]]. Wall sconces are available for tea light and votive candles. For pillar-type candles, the assortment of candle holders is broad. A fireproof plate, such as a glass plate or small mirror, can be a candle holder for a pillar-style candle. A pedestal of any kind, with the appropriate-sized fireproof top, is another option. A large glass bowl with a large flat bottom and tall mostly vertical curved sides is called a hurricane. The pillar-style candle is placed at the bottom center of the hurricane. A hurricane on a pedestal is sometimes sold as a unit.\n\nA [[bob\u00e8che]] is a drip-catching ring, which may also be affixed to a candle holder, or used independently of one. Bob\u00e8ches can range from ornate metal or glass to simple plastic, cardboard, or wax paper. Use of paper or plastic bob\u00e8ches is common at events where candles are distributed to a crowd or audience, such as Christmas carolers or people at other concerts/festivals.\n\n===Candle followers===\nThese are glass or metal tubes with an internal stricture partway along, which sit around the top of a lit candle. As the candle burns, the wax melts and the follower holds the melted wax in, whilst the stricture rests on the topmost solid portion of wax. Candle followers are often deliberately heavy or weighted to ensure they move down as the candle burns lower, maintaining a seal and preventing wax escape. The purpose of a candle follower is threefold:\n* To contain the melted wax, making the candle more efficient, avoiding mess, and producing a more even burn.\n* As a decoration, either due to the ornate nature of the device, or (in the case of a glass follower) through light dispersion or colouration.\n* If necessary, to shield the flame from wind.\n\nCandle followers are often found in churches on [[altar candle]]s.\n\n===Candle snuffers===\n{{main|Candle snuffer}}\nCandle snuffers are instruments used to extinguish burning candles by smothering the flame with a small metal cup that is suspended from a long handle, and thus depriving it of oxygen. An older meaning refers to a scissor-like tool used to trim the wick of a candle. With skill, this could be done without extinguishing the flame. The instrument now known as a candle snuffer was formerly called an \"extinguisher\" or \"douter\".\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Candle-making]]\n* [[Candle warmer]]\n* [[Candelabra]]\n* [[Julleuchter]]\n* [[Outdoor candle]]\n* [[Rushlight]]\n* [[Singing candle]]\n* [[Tealight]]\n* [[Trick candles]]\n* [[Trudon]]\n* [[Unity candle]]\n* [[Yahrzeit candle]]{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote|Candles}}\n{{CE1913 poster|Candles}}\n* {{Commons category-inline|Candles}}\n* [http://www.candles.org/ National Candle Association] of the [[United States|U.S.]]\n* [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14474 The Chemical History of a Candle] by Michael Faraday\n* [http://www.europecandles.org/ Association of European Candlemakers(AECM)]\n* [http://www.eca-candles.eu/ European Candle Association (ECA)]\n* [http://www.alafave.org/ Latin American Candle Manufacturers Association (ALAFAVE)]\n* [https://www.osmology.co/blog/candle-safety/ Guide To Candle Safety At Home - Osmology]\n\n{{Artificial light sources}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Candles| ]]\n", "name_user": "2600:1700:30c1:a10:88d3:1565:78ba:7524", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candle"}
