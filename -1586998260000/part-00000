{"title_page": "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures", "text_new": "'''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures''' are toys based on the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles|franchise of the same name]] and have been produced by the company [[Playmates Toys]] since 1988. Staff artists at the [[Northampton, Massachusetts]] based [[Mirage Studios]] have provided conceptual designs for many of the figures, vehicles, and playsets and are credited on the packaging of the products they created.\n\n==Getting started==\nThe first TMNT license came in the form of a [[role-playing game]] by [[Palladium Books|Palladium]], followed by miniatures from [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]]. Within a year, [[First Comics]] began to reprint the early issues in color volumes; four were produced, stopping at issue 11. These sold well, and Eastman and Laird were soon contacted by Mark Freedman, a licensing agent who believed he could make something of the Turtles. Freedman took the idea to a variety of toy companies, only to be turned down by those who felt the concept was not popular enough to support a toy line. Only one company expressed interest, a little-known California company by the name of Playmates. The illustrations you see here are designed by toy designer T. Mark Taylor who designed the first Turtle toy line and created additional new characters  like \u201c Rock Steady, BeBop , The Foot \u201c.  The Party Wagon, The Blimp, And others.\n\nNot entirely willing to risk marketing a small [[cult following|cult]] comic book, Playmates insisted that a cartoon series be produced first.<ref>[http://www.tmnt25.com/turtle_power/about_the_creators.html#4 About the Creators] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420143103/http://www.tmnt25.com/turtle_power/about_the_creators.html#4 |date=2009-04-20 }} TMNT25.com (January 2009). Retrieved on 1-31-09.</ref> Development initiated with a creative team of companies and individuals: Jerry Sachs, famous ad man of Sachs-Finley Agency, brought together the animators at Murakami-Wolf-Swenson, headed by award-winning animator Fred Wolf. Wolf and his team combined concepts and ideas with Playmates marketing crew, headed by Karl Aaronian and then VP of Sales, Richard Sallis and President of Playmates, Bill Carlson. Aaronian brought on several designers and concepteer and writer John Schulte and worked out the simple backstory that would live on toy packaging for the entire run of the product and show. Sachs called the high-concept pitch \"Green Against Brick\". The sense of humor was honed with the collaboration of MWS's writers, Walk Kubiak, Aaronian, Schulte and Sachs. Playmates and their team essentially served as associate producers and contributing writers to the miniseries that was first launch to sell-in the toy action figures. Phrases like \"Heroes in a Half Shell\" and many of the comical catch phrases and battle slogans (\"Turtle Power!\") came from the writing and conceptualization of this creative team. As the series developed, veteran writer Jack Mendelsohn came on board as both a story editor and scriptwriter. David Wise, Michael Charles Hill and Michael Reaves wrote most of the scripts, taking input via Mendelsohn and collaborating writer Schulte and marketing maven Aaronian. In signing with [[Murakami-Wolf-Swenson|Murakami-Wolf-Swenson Productions]], Eastman and Laird saw the production of the first [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|TMNT cartoon]] in December 1987. Playmates held up their end of the deal and produced the first series of TMNT action figures in the summer of 1988. The premiere series included the four Turtles, [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]], [[April O'Neil|April]], [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]], [[Bebop and Rocksteady|Rocksteady]], [[Bebop and Rocksteady|Bebop]], and a [[Foot Clan|Foot Soldier]]. Vehicles included the Cheapskate, Turtle Trooper, Turtle Blimp, and Foot Knucklehead. Each vehicle set was packaged with a jokebook and a small catalog. If one was to clip the \"Pizza Point\"s located on the reverse side of the packaging then a person could redeem them along with a small fee for other Turtles merchandise like VHS tapes, posters, bath towels, among others. Corresponding firmly with its animated series counterpart, the original TMNT action figure line would last ten years and develop a legacy within the toy realm.\n\n==Overview==\nThe first three series of figures took obvious influence from the original Mirage comics. The Turtles lacked pupils and had bulging muscles with large veins. The blister card art was also very unrefined and reflected the comics; in fact, Shredder's pose was based directly on art from the debut issue. Each figure had at least 7 points of articulation (neck, shoulders, wrists, hips), many accessories including the characters signature weapon, and a bio card on the back of the blister package that kids could cut out and collect. Also included was a fully illustrated origin story on the card's backside which was phased out during the 4th series. The figures boasted highly detailed sculpting, especially for the time. Colorful characters like General Traag, Rat King, Mutagen man, Scumbug, Pizza Face, Muckman, and many others featured intricate details such as small animals crawling over them, large scars, torn clothing, and pieces of garbage stuck to their bodies.\n\nWith the release of the second series in 1989, fans saw ten entirely new figures: five allies and five enemies, six new vehicles/accessories, the first playset, the Turtle Battle Fun role-play sets, 9\" and 13\" plush dolls, and official Retromutagen Ooze. This year also marked the first time Playmates would incorporate action features into their figures along with the first Turtle variants in the \"Wacky Action\" sub-line. Each figure possessed a wind-up function that, when applied, caused the figure's limbs to rapidly move in a rhythmic motion.\n\n''Wacky Action'' was merely the tip of the iceberg, however, as the new decade of the 1990s dawned ''Talkin' Turtles'', ''Head Droppin' Turtles'', ''Mutations'', ''Sewer Sports Turtles'', and dozens of other fresh ideas began making their way to toy shelves. With such innovations, Ninja Turtle action figures were sure to gain a foothold in the toy market.\n\n===Vehicles/accessories===\nConsidering all of the vehicles and inventions conceived by [[Donatello (TMNT)|Donatello]], Playmates couldn't have their figures without a slew of toy gadgetry to interact with. Aside from vehicles actually seen in the cartoon, Playmates went on to create a wide variety other accessories. These often expressed the humorous side of TMNT with gadgets commonly made out of sewer lids, trash cans, plungers, and toilet seats. However, vehicles would also include a diversity of play features from the ripcord action of the Psycho Cycle to the electronic launching of the Turtle Pizza Thrower to the smoky bubble spout of the Bubble Bomber. For its time, TMNT was remarkably innovative in terms of fun action figure accessories.\n\nIn the midst of action figures filling the store shelves, role playing toys were also released. Depending on the depicted character, these typically included a ninja mask and plastic weapons. Other TMNT toys would be sold individually such as the Turtle Communicator, Raphael's Spy goggles, and Leo's Sewer Force Sword.\n\nOne of the most famous components of the TMNT realm is the [[radioactive]] slime Retromutagen Ooze, which mutated the Ninja Turtles from common house pets to \"mean, green, fightin' machines.\" Thus, even Ooze was produced for the interaction with TMNT figures in 1989. The green slime was sold in a small container which also included a [[Phosphorescence|glow-in-the-dark]] Ninja Turtle in mid-mutation.  Aside from the classic \"Turtle Green,\" a \"Purple Foot\" variation would also become available in 1993. Ooze was an essential component to playsets such as the Flushomatic, and action figures like [[List of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles characters#Muckman|Muckman]], who could have it run from his hollow head and out his mouth. Depending on their features, occasional figures and accessories came with their own smaller canister of Ooze to fulfill the playtime experience.\n\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:TMNT1991Checklist.jpg|right|thumb|140px|Turtles '91 checklist]] -->\n\n==Themes and incarnations==\nThroughout the 1990s, Ninja Turtle action figures would run an extensive gauntlet of different themes and incarnations. Whereas [[Batman action figures|Batman]] may have become known for hundreds of gadget-wielding action figures, the Ninja Turtles would become synonymous with dozens of historical and pop culture related embodiments; which would be replicated by Kenner in their \"Legends of Batman\" line.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_action_figures#Legends_of_Batman</ref> Varying concepts and toy trends resulted in the many examples shown below.\n\n*Basic series figures taking on various looks; Leo, the Sewer Samurai, Don, the Undercover Turtle, Mike, the Sewer Surfer, and Raph, the [[Space Cadet]]. (1990) Also released with the basic line were the four turtles with Storage Shell. Each action figure had an opening back shell which could store the various accessories each figure was packaged with. Donatello would be released in 1990 and the remaining three the following year.\n*''Mutant [[United States military|Military]]'' - Different forms of military - [[Lieutenant]] Leo, Pro [[aviator|Pilot]] Don, [[Midshipman]] Mike, and Raph, the [[United States Army Special Forces|Green Teen Beret]]. (1991)\n*''[[rock 'n' roll|Rock'n Rollin']]'' - Vibrant musical gimmicks; [[classic rock|Classic Rocker]] Leo, [[punk rock|Punker]] Don, [[hip hop music|Rappin']] Mike, and [[Heavy metal music|Heavy metal]] Raph. (1991)\n*''Sewer Sports All-Stars'' - Sport-themed figures with action features; Among others, [[American football|T.D. Tossin']] Leo, [[basketball|Slam Dunkin']] Don, [[professional wrestling|Shell Slammin']] Mike, and [[baseball|Grand Slammin']] Raph. (1991)\n*''Wacky Wild West'' - The Ninja Turtles taking on the [[Old West]]; [[Native Americans in the United States|Chief]] Leo, Crazy [[Cowboy]] Don, Bandito-Bashin' Mike, and Sewer Scout Raph.(1992)\n*''Cave-Turtles'' - [[Stone Age]] \"Collectible Turtle Combo\" boxsets; Among others, Leo and his [[Triceratops|Dingy Dino]], Don and his Trippy [[Tyrannosaurus]], Mike and his Silly [[Stegosaurus]], and Raph and his Tubular [[Pterodactyl]]. (1992-'93)\n*''Turtle [[troll#troll dolls|Trolls]]'' - A take on the early 1990s troll doll craze; Leo, Don, Mike, and Raph featuring tall, synthetic hair and childlike appearances. (1993)\n*''[[Universal Studios]] Monsters'' - Classic monster-themed figures; Among others, Leo as the [[Werewolf|Wolfman]], Don as [[Dracula]], Mike as [[Frankenstein]]'s monster, Raph as the [[Mummy]], and [[Bride of Frankenstein]] April. (1993-'94)\n*''[[Star Trek]]'' - A crossover due to Playmates' owning both ''Star Trek'' and TMNT licenses; [[Captain (Star Trek)|Captain]] Leonardo, [[First Officer (Star Trek)]] Don, [[Chief Engineer]] Michelangelo, and [[Chief Medical Officer (Star Trek)|Chief Medical Officer]] Raphael. (1994)\n*''Adventurers'' - Figures dressed for adventuring; Deep Sea Diver Leonardo, [[Arctic]] Donatello, and [[Safari]] Michelangelo. (1995)\n*''[[Jim Lee]]'s TMNT'' - Majorly restyled Ninja Turtle figures based on the designs of famous [[comic book artist]] Jim Lee. (1995)\n*''Mutant Masters'' - The Ninja Turtles sporting [[Anime]] inspired armor as \"ancient mythic warriors\"; Leonardo Wind Warrior, Donatello Water Warrior, Michelangelo Thunder Warrior, and Raphael Fire Warrior. (1997)\n\nEven with the silliest of concepts, Playmates managed to create some intriguing and fun figure designs for children. In contrast to other companies like [[Kenner Products|Kenner]], who constantly re-released figure sculpts with different paint jobs, Playmates rarely showed a cheap or careless effort in their TMNT figures. But with rising competition, limited figure concepts, and the end of the cartoon series, a pitfall was inevitable.\n\n===''Movie Stars'' and ''Toon Turtles''===\nBy the second, less violent TMNT film, ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze]]'', Playmates decided to create a figure collection based on the characters' live-action appearance. In contrast to the regular figures, these were made of a softer, more rubbery material to better reflect the look of the [[animatronic]] costumes used in the films. They also featured ball joints at the neck, shoulders, and hips, and each figure came with a small, canister of Ooze.  In terms of character variety, however, the ''Movie Stars'' collections were in stark contrast to the wide variety seen in the basic figure lines.\n\n1992 also saw the production of ''Toon Turtles''. These figures took on an almost [[stereotypical]] approach to being humorously cartoon-like.  Each character bore a friendly, animated appearance with a glittery paint job and including some type of \"cartoon\" action feature (Raphael's head spun, Michelangelo's tongue unraveled in [[Tex Avery]] fashion, etc.). On the upside, this series produced a more \"cartoon accurate\" painted version of Shredder and introduced toys not previously made for many longtime characters from the cartoon series such as the Neutrinos and April O'Neil's co-workers, [[Irma Langinstein]], [[List of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles characters#Burne Thompson|Burne Thompson]] and [[Vernon Fenwick]].\n\nA third movie hit theatres in 1993 but saw less success than its predecessors.  This collection featured the Ninja Turtles once again in their ''Movie Star'' likeness and sporting [[samurai]] armor, as well as several other side characters. The ''Giant Movie III Samurai'' figures also came complete with removable masks and time [[scepter]]s as seen in the film.\n\n===Mini Mutants===\nIn 1994, Playmates, in an attempt capitalize on toy lines like [[Mighty Max (toyline)|Mighty Max]] and [[Polly Pocket]], shrunk the Turtles down to an equally small size in a sub-line simply named \"Mini Mutants\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmnttoys.com/figures1987.html#88 |title=Mini-Mutants |publisher=Tmnttoys.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}</ref> These were \"Turtle Transport Combos\" which contained one figure and two vehicles. \"Bodacious Battlesets\" which were four playsets which could connect via bridges/platforms; these included one figure. \"Turtle Top Playsets\" were a characters head which would open into a double decker playset; these included three figures. Slimmer \"Carry Along Playsets\" took the shape of Raph's sai, Leo's katana, and the Turtle Communicator; these came with three figures. And finally, \"Turtle in a Turtle\" consisted of four playsets that were figures of the four turtles about 6&nbsp;inches taller than the normal figure; their heads, stomachs, and shells opened into the playsets. Each had themed removable armor as well; two figures were included with each.\n\n===WWE Tie In===\nPlaymates also released a series of four special edition [[WWE]] themed figures. The line featured only figures of the four turtles, presented in the wrestling attire of famous WWE Wrestlers. This line included: [[The Undertaker]] (Don), [[John Cena]] (Leo), [[Sting (wrestler)]] (Raph), and [[Macho Man Randy Savage]] (Mikey).<ref>https://www.wwe.com/gallery/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-wwe-action-figures-photos#fid-40054465</ref>\n\n==Unproduced toys==\n\nThe original Ninja Turtle line ran for almost ten years and, in that time, various planned items would ultimately not hit toy shelves. Some of these went as far as the prototype stage and being presented at New York Toy Fairs; others had only designs drawn.\n\n===1989===\n\n* The original Casey Jones figure had an interchangeable head without a detachable mask. The sculpt looked to be based on the Mirage Comics.\n\n===1991===\n\n* Turtle Tenderizer 4x4\n* Leo's Turtle Shell Backpack\n* 13\" April - drawing gives the impression she would have been in the vein of a Barbie doll\n* Tokka Battle Fun Set\n\n===1992===\n\n* Michelangelo's Sidewalk Surfer\n* Raph's Pizza-Powered Parachute - this was produced with Donatello instead\n* Retromutagen Rifle\n* Turtle Popcan Racer\n\n===1993===\n\n* Giant Movie 3 versions of Don and Mike\n* \u201cTransforming\u201d Muta-Party Wagon. It would have transformed into a 19\" Robot Turtle with a resemblance to Metalhead\n\n===1994===\n\n* The Star Trek Leonardo/ Kirk figure was originally shown in his green shirt and had a different sculpting.\n* The Start Trek Don and Mike figures originally had all unique sculptings.\n* A Giant Cyber Samurai\n* \u201cWarriors of the Forgotten Sewer\u201d \u201cKnight Mike,\u201d \u201cWizard Splinter,\u201d and \u201cSavage Leo with Sewer Warcat\u201d two-pack\n* Sewer Subway Car vehicle\n* \u201cNinjamobiles\u201d - Turtle Van and Foot module in an Ed \u201cBig Daddy\u201d Roth style\n* A \u201cKung Fu Tournament Fighters\u201d Leonardo\n\n===1995===\n\n* Team Ninja Figure assortment (the four turtles in cybernetic armor)\n* Metal Mutant Rocksteady with Serpent Armor\n* Metal Mutant Bebop with Fish Armor\n* Metal Mutant War Horse\n* Warrior Rahzar with Fur\n* Jim Lee's TMNT Leonardo\n* 8 Mini Mutant Vehicle Combos\n* Repaints of \"The Military Turtles\" - Leo and Raph were from the 1991 series and Don and Mike were from the \u201992 series.\n* Shredder's Ooze and Raphael's Pizza Chompin' Portable Games\n\n===1998===\n\n* Dr. Quease\n* Shadow Ninja Deluxe figures\n\n===Unknown Year===\n*  April as Cat\n\n==Advertising==\nTMNT action figure [[TV commercials|commercials]] that started with the first series featured clips from the cartoon and narration describing the figures which were shown in incredible \"toy size\" environments. This also went for vehicles and playsets. The scenes from the show were overdubbed with dialogue usually from the actual voice actors that went along with story in the ad.\n\nDuring post movie success, many commercials relied on live-action, animatronic Ninja Turtles similar to those seen in the \"Coming Out of their Shells\" Tour. Prime examples of these include 1992 spots for the Bubble Bomber vehicle featuring Raphael in military fatigues and ''Bodacious Birthday'' figures where a surprise party was thrown in the Turtles' sewer lair.\n\n==1996\u20131998: Dry spell==\nBy 1996, the cartoon series that lasted nearly a decade had come to an end. The following year, a new live-action series premiered entitled ''[[Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation]]''. The series was somewhat short-lived but managed to make for an extensive action figure line. Alongside the basic TMNT characters, this collection of taller scale figures included a female Ninja Turtle named [[Venus (TMNT)|Venus]]. The show's demise, however, would further confirm the dissolving popularity of the Ninja Turtles, and the franchise would remain in limbo for years to come. Left with a disappointing movie four years past and virtually no place on television, the TMNT franchise would face a halt in action figure production for several years.\n\n==2003\u20132012==\nOn February 8, 2003, Fox revived the TMNT franchise with a brand new [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series)|cartoon series]].  With it inevitably came a series of action figures.  These figures showed reminiscence of those released in 1988 yet with the refreshed design of the new, bold look of the cartoon series. Unlike the previous figures, most of the figures released in this collection actually appeared in the 2003 series. This collection successfully continued into 2006 with new character designs and even an occasional revisiting of past concepts like 1993's ''Cave-Turtles''. In 2006, by request of Playmates, the cartoon series took a new lighter direction which brought ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fast Forward]]'', a futuristic take on the heroic mutants. Playmates thought of this change as a means of selling more new Turtles action figures.\n\nMarch 2007 introduced fans to a new [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] feature film entitled simply [[TMNT (film)|''TMNT'']]. This introduced the Ninja Turtles on-screen to a new generation and corresponded with an extensive action figure line. New figures based on the film continued to be produced into the following year.\n\nIn September 2007, it was announced that the collectible figure company [[National Entertainment Collectibles Association|NECA]] had acquired the license to produce Ninja Turtle figures based on their character likenesses from the original Mirage comic books. The first wave of figures consisted of the four Turtles and was released in comic and specialty stores in early 2008. The New York Comic Con also boasted an exclusive figure four-pack, and that same year, NECA released black & white versions of the Turtles just as they appeared in the pages of the comics.<ref>Cochran, Jay [http://toynewsi.com/news.php?catid=20&itemid=12381 Black & White Teenage Mutant Turtle Figures Coming From NECA] TNI News (January 23, 2008).

Staff artists at the [[Northampton, Massachusetts]] based [[Mirage Studios]] have provided conceptual designs for many of the figures, vehicles, and playsets and are credited on the packaging of the products they created.\n\n==Getting started==\nThe first TMNT license came in the form of a [[role-playing game]] by [[Palladium Books|Palladium]], followed by miniatures from [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]]. Within a year, [[First Comics]] began to reprint the early issues in color volumes; four were produced, stopping at issue 11. These sold well, and Eastman and Laird were soon contacted by Mark Freedman, a licensing agent who believed he could make something of the Turtles. Freedman took the idea to a variety of toy companies, only to be turned down by those who felt the concept was not popular enough to support a toy line. Only one company expressed interest, a little-known California company by the name of Playmates. The illustrations you see here are designed by toy designer T. Mark Taylor who designed the first Turtle toy line and created additional new characters  like \u201c Rock Steady, BeBop , The Foot \u201c.  The Party Wagon, The Blimp, And others.\n\nNot entirely willing to risk marketing a small [[cult following|cult]] comic book, Playmates insisted that a cartoon series be produced first.<ref>[http://www.tmnt25.com/turtle_power/about_the_creators.html#4 About the Creators] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420143103/http://www.tmnt25.com/turtle_power/about_the_creators.html#4 |date=2009-04-20 }} TMNT25.com (January 2009). Retrieved on 1-31-09.</ref> Development initiated with a creative team of companies and individuals: Jerry Sachs, famous ad man of Sachs-Finley Agency, brought together the animators at Murakami-Wolf-Swenson, headed by award-winning animator Fred Wolf. Wolf and his team combined concepts and ideas with Playmates marketing crew, headed by Karl Aaronian and then VP of Sales, Richard Sallis and President of Playmates, Bill Carlson. Aaronian brought on several designers and concepteer and writer John Schulte and worked out the simple backstory that would live on toy packaging for the entire run of the product and show. Sachs called the high-concept pitch \"Green Against Brick\". The sense of humor was honed with the collaboration of MWS's writers, Walk Kubiak, Aaronian, Schulte and Sachs. Playmates and their team essentially served as associate producers and contributing writers to the miniseries that was first launch to sell-in the toy action figures. Phrases like \"Heroes in a Half Shell\" and many of the comical catch phrases and battle slogans (\"Turtle Power!\") came from the writing and conceptualization of this creative team. As the series developed, veteran writer Jack Mendelsohn came on board as both a story editor and scriptwriter. David Wise, Michael Charles Hill and Michael Reaves wrote most of the scripts, taking input via Mendelsohn and collaborating writer Schulte and marketing maven Aaronian. In signing with [[Murakami-Wolf-Swenson|Murakami-Wolf-Swenson Productions]], Eastman and Laird saw the production of the first [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|TMNT cartoon]] in December 1987. Playmates held up their end of the deal and produced the first series of TMNT action figures in the summer of 1988. The premiere series included the four Turtles, [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]], [[April O'Neil|April]], [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]], [[Bebop and Rocksteady|Rocksteady]], [[Bebop and Rocksteady|Bebop]], and a [[Foot Clan|Foot Soldier]]. Vehicles included the Cheapskate, Turtle Trooper, Turtle Blimp, and Foot Knucklehead. Each vehicle set was packaged with a jokebook and a small catalog. If one was to clip the \"Pizza Point\"s located on the reverse side of the packaging then a person could redeem them along with a small fee for other Turtles merchandise like VHS tapes, posters, bath towels, among others. Corresponding firmly with its animated series counterpart, the original TMNT action figure line would last ten years and develop a legacy within the toy realm.\n\n==Overview==\nThe first three series of figures took obvious influence from the original Mirage comics. The Turtles lacked pupils and had bulging muscles with large veins. The blister card art was also very unrefined and reflected the comics; in fact, Shredder's pose was based directly on art from the debut issue. Each figure had at least 7 points of articulation (neck, shoulders, wrists, hips), many accessories including the characters signature weapon, and a bio card on the back of the blister package that kids could cut out and collect. Also included was a fully illustrated origin story on the card's backside which was phased out during the 4th series. The figures boasted highly detailed sculpting, especially for the time. Colorful characters like General Traag, Rat King, Mutagen man, Scumbug, Pizza Face, Muckman, and many others featured intricate details such as small animals crawling over them, large scars, torn clothing, and pieces of garbage stuck to their bodies.\n\nWith the release of the second series in 1989, fans saw ten entirely new figures: five allies and five enemies, six new vehicles/accessories, the first playset, the Turtle Battle Fun role-play sets, 9\" and 13\" plush dolls, and official Retromutagen Ooze. This year also marked the first time Playmates would incorporate action features into their figures along with the first Turtle variants in the \"Wacky Action\" sub-line. Each figure possessed a wind-up function that, when applied, caused the figure's limbs to rapidly move in a rhythmic motion.\n\n''Wacky Action'' was merely the tip of the iceberg, however, as the new decade of the 1990s dawned ''Talkin' Turtles'', ''Head Droppin' Turtles'', ''Mutations'', ''Sewer Sports Turtles'', and dozens of other fresh ideas began making their way to toy shelves. With such innovations, Ninja Turtle action figures were sure to gain a foothold in the toy market.\n\n===Vehicles/accessories===\nConsidering all of the vehicles and inventions conceived by [[Donatello (TMNT)|Donatello]], Playmates couldn't have their figures without a slew of toy gadgetry to interact with. Aside from vehicles actually seen in the cartoon, Playmates went on to create a wide variety other accessories. These often expressed the humorous side of TMNT with gadgets commonly made out of sewer lids, trash cans, plungers, and toilet seats. However, vehicles would also include a diversity of play features from the ripcord action of the Psycho Cycle to the electronic launching of the Turtle Pizza Thrower to the smoky bubble spout of the Bubble Bomber. For its time, TMNT was remarkably innovative in terms of fun action figure accessories.\n\nIn the midst of action figures filling the store shelves, role playing toys were also released. Depending on the depicted character, these typically included a ninja mask and plastic weapons. Other TMNT toys would be sold individually such as the Turtle Communicator, Raphael's Spy goggles, and Leo's Sewer Force Sword.\n\nOne of the most famous components of the TMNT realm is the [[radioactive]] slime Retromutagen Ooze, which mutated the Ninja Turtles from common house pets to \"mean, green, fightin' machines.\" Thus, even Ooze was produced for the interaction with TMNT figures in 1989. The green slime was sold in a small container which also included a [[Phosphorescence|glow-in-the-dark]] Ninja Turtle in mid-mutation.  Aside from the classic \"Turtle Green,\" a \"Purple Foot\" variation would also become available in 1993. Ooze was an essential component to playsets such as the Flushomatic, and action figures like [[List of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles characters#Muckman|Muckman]], who could have it run from his hollow head and out his mouth. Depending on their features, occasional figures and accessories came with their own smaller canister of Ooze to fulfill the playtime experience.\n\n<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:TMNT1991Checklist.jpg|right|thumb|140px|Turtles '91 checklist]] -->\n\n==Themes and incarnations==\nThroughout the 1990s, Ninja Turtle action figures would run an extensive gauntlet of different themes and incarnations. Whereas [[Batman action figures|Batman]] may have become known for hundreds of gadget-wielding action figures, the Ninja Turtles would become synonymous with dozens of historical and pop culture related embodiments; which would be replicated by Kenner in their \"Legends of Batman\" line<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_action_figures#Legends_of_Batman</ref>. Varying concepts and toy trends resulted in the many examples shown below.\n\n*Basic series figures taking on various looks; Leo, the Sewer Samurai, Don, the Undercover Turtle, Mike, the Sewer Surfer, and Raph, the [[Space Cadet]]. (1990) Also released with the basic line were the four turtles with Storage Shell. Each action figure had an opening back shell which could store the various accessories each figure was packaged with. Donatello would be released in 1990 and the remaining three the following year.\n*''Mutant [[United States military|Military]]'' - Different forms of military - [[Lieutenant]] Leo, Pro [[aviator|Pilot]] Don, [[Midshipman]] Mike, and Raph, the [[United States Army Special Forces|Green Teen Beret]]. (1991)\n*''[[rock 'n' roll|Rock'n Rollin']]'' - Vibrant musical gimmicks; [[classic rock|Classic Rocker]] Leo, [[punk rock|Punker]] Don, [[hip hop music|Rappin']] Mike, and [[Heavy metal music|Heavy metal]] Raph. (1991)\n*''Sewer Sports All-Stars'' - Sport-themed figures with action features; Among others, [[American football|T.D. Tossin']] Leo, [[basketball|Slam Dunkin']] Don, [[professional wrestling|Shell Slammin']] Mike, and [[baseball|Grand Slammin']] Raph. (1991)\n*''Wacky Wild West'' - The Ninja Turtles taking on the [[Old West]]; [[Native Americans in the United States|Chief]] Leo, Crazy [[Cowboy]] Don, Bandito-Bashin' Mike, and Sewer Scout Raph.(1992)\n*''Cave-Turtles'' - [[Stone Age]] \"Collectible Turtle Combo\" boxsets; Among others, Leo and his [[Triceratops|Dingy Dino]], Don and his Trippy [[Tyrannosaurus]], Mike and his Silly [[Stegosaurus]], and Raph and his Tubular [[Pterodactyl]]. (1992-'93)\n*''Turtle [[troll#troll dolls|Trolls]]'' - A take on the early 1990s troll doll craze; Leo, Don, Mike, and Raph featuring tall, synthetic hair and childlike appearances. (1993)\n*''[[Universal Studios]] Monsters'' - Classic monster-themed figures; Among others, Leo as the [[Werewolf|Wolfman]], Don as [[Dracula]], Mike as [[Frankenstein]]'s monster, Raph as the [[Mummy]], and [[Bride of Frankenstein]] April. (1993-'94)\n*''[[Star Trek]]'' - A crossover due to Playmates' owning both ''Star Trek'' and TMNT licenses; [[Captain (Star Trek)|Captain]] Leonardo, [[First Officer (Star Trek)]] Don, [[Chief Engineer]] Michelangelo, and [[Chief Medical Officer (Star Trek)|Chief Medical Officer]] Raphael. (1994)\n*''Adventurers'' - Figures dressed for adventuring; Deep Sea Diver Leonardo, [[Arctic]] Donatello, and [[Safari]] Michelangelo. (1995)\n*''[[Jim Lee]]'s TMNT'' - Majorly restyled Ninja Turtle figures based on the designs of famous [[comic book artist]] Jim Lee. (1995)\n*''Mutant Masters'' - The Ninja Turtles sporting [[Anime]] inspired armor as \"ancient mythic warriors\"; Leonardo Wind Warrior, Donatello Water Warrior, Michelangelo Thunder Warrior, and Raphael Fire Warrior. (1997)\n\nEven with the silliest of concepts, Playmates managed to create some intriguing and fun figure designs for children. In contrast to other companies like [[Kenner Products|Kenner]], who constantly re-released figure sculpts with different paint jobs, Playmates rarely showed a cheap or careless effort in their TMNT figures. But with rising competition, limited figure concepts, and the end of the cartoon series, a pitfall was inevitable.\n\n===''Movie Stars'' and ''Toon Turtles''===\nBy the second, less violent TMNT film, ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze]]'', Playmates decided to create a figure collection based on the characters' live-action appearance. In contrast to the regular figures, these were made of a softer, more rubbery material to better reflect the look of the [[animatronic]] costumes used in the films. They also featured ball joints at the neck, shoulders, and hips, and each figure came with a small, canister of Ooze.  In terms of character variety, however, the ''Movie Stars'' collections were in stark contrast to the wide variety seen in the basic figure lines.\n\n1992 also saw the production of ''Toon Turtles''. These figures took on an almost [[stereotypical]] approach to being humorously cartoon-like.  Each character bore a friendly, animated appearance with a glittery paint job and including some type of \"cartoon\" action feature (Raphael's head spun, Michelangelo's tongue unraveled in [[Tex Avery]] fashion, etc.). On the upside, this series produced a more \"cartoon accurate\" painted version of Shredder and introduced toys not previously made for many longtime characters from the cartoon series such as the Neutrinos and April O'Neil's co-workers, [[Irma Langinstein]], [[List of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles characters#Burne Thompson|Burne Thompson]] and [[Vernon Fenwick]].\n\nA third movie hit theatres in 1993 but saw less success than its predecessors.  This collection featured the Ninja Turtles once again in their ''Movie Star'' likeness and sporting [[samurai]] armor, as well as several other side characters. The ''Giant Movie III Samurai'' figures also came complete with removable masks and time [[scepter]]s as seen in the film.\n\n===Mini Mutants===\nIn 1994, Playmates, in an attempt capitalize on toy lines like [[Mighty Max (toyline)|Mighty Max]] and [[Polly Pocket]], shrunk the Turtles down to an equally small size in a sub-line simply named \"Mini Mutants\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmnttoys.com/figures1987.html#88 |title=Mini-Mutants |publisher=Tmnttoys.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}</ref> These were \"Turtle Transport Combos\" which contained one figure and two vehicles. \"Bodacious Battlesets\" which were four playsets which could connect via bridges/platforms; these included one figure. \"Turtle Top Playsets\" were a characters head which would open into a double decker playset; these included three figures. Slimmer \"Carry Along Playsets\" took the shape of Raph's sai, Leo's katana, and the Turtle Communicator; these came with three figures. And finally, \"Turtle in a Turtle\" consisted of four playsets that were figures of the four turtles about 6&nbsp;inches taller than the normal figure; their heads, stomachs, and shells opened into the playsets. Each had themed removable armor as well; two figures were included with each.\n\n===WWE Tie In===\nPlaymates also released a series of four special edition [[WWE]] themed figures. The line featured only figures of the four turtles, presented in the wrestling attire of famous WWE Wrestlers. This line included: [[The Undertaker]] (Don), [[John Cena]] (Leo), [[Sting (wrestler)]] (Raph), and [[Macho Man Randy Savage]] (Mikey).<ref>https://www.wwe.com/gallery/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-wwe-action-figures-photos#fid-40054465</ref>\n\n==Unproduced toys==\n\nThe original Ninja Turtle line ran for almost ten years and, in that time, various planned items would ultimately not hit toy shelves. Some of these went as far as the prototype stage and being presented at New York Toy Fairs; others had only designs drawn.\n\n===1989===\n\n* The original Casey Jones figure had an interchangeable head without a detachable mask. The sculpt looked to be based on the Mirage Comics.\n\n===1991===\n\n* Turtle Tenderizer 4x4\n* Leo's Turtle Shell Backpack\n* 13\" April - drawing gives the impression she would have been in the vein of a Barbie doll\n* Tokka Battle Fun Set\n\n===1992===\n\n* Michelangelo's Sidewalk Surfer\n* Raph's Pizza-Powered Parachute - this was produced with Donatello instead\n* Retromutagen Rifle\n* Turtle Popcan Racer\n\n===1993===\n\n* Giant Movie 3 versions of Don and Mike\n* \u201cTransforming\u201d Muta-Party Wagon. It would have transformed into a 19\" Robot Turtle with a resemblance to Metalhead\n\n===1994===\n\n* The Star Trek Leonardo/ Kirk figure was originally shown in his green shirt and had a different sculpting.\n* The Start Trek Don and Mike figures originally had all unique sculptings.\n* A Giant Cyber Samurai\n* \u201cWarriors of the Forgotten Sewer\u201d \u201cKnight Mike,\u201d \u201cWizard Splinter,\u201d and \u201cSavage Leo with Sewer Warcat\u201d two-pack\n* Sewer Subway Car vehicle\n* \u201cNinjamobiles\u201d - Turtle Van and Foot module in an Ed \u201cBig Daddy\u201d Roth style\n* A \u201cKung Fu Tournament Fighters\u201d Leonardo\n\n===1995===\n\n* Team Ninja Figure assortment (the four turtles in cybernetic armor)\n* Metal Mutant Rocksteady with Serpent Armor\n* Metal Mutant Bebop with Fish Armor\n* Metal Mutant War Horse\n* Warrior Rahzar with Fur\n* Jim Lee's TMNT Leonardo\n* 8 Mini Mutant Vehicle Combos\n* Repaints of \"The Military Turtles\" - Leo and Raph were from the 1991 series and Don and Mike were from the \u201992 series.\n* Shredder's Ooze and Raphael's Pizza Chompin' Portable Games\n\n===1998===\n\n* Dr. Quease\n* Shadow Ninja Deluxe figures\n\n===Unknown Year===\n*  April as Cat\n\n==Advertising==\nTMNT action figure [[TV commercials|commercials]] that started with the first series featured clips from the cartoon and narration describing the figures which were shown in incredible \"toy size\" environments. This also went for vehicles and playsets. The scenes from the show were overdubbed with dialogue usually from the actual voice actors that went along with story in the ad.\n\nDuring post movie success, many commercials relied on live-action, animatronic Ninja Turtles similar to those seen in the \"Coming Out of their Shells\" Tour. Prime examples of these include 1992 spots for the Bubble Bomber vehicle featuring Raphael in military fatigues and ''Bodacious Birthday'' figures where a surprise party was thrown in the Turtles' sewer lair.\n\n==1996\u20131998: Dry spell==\nBy 1996, the cartoon series that lasted nearly a decade had come to an end. The following year, a new live-action series premiered entitled ''[[Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation]]''. The series was somewhat short-lived but managed to make for an extensive action figure line. Alongside the basic TMNT characters, this collection of taller scale figures included a female Ninja Turtle named [[Venus (TMNT)|Venus]]. The show's demise, however, would further confirm the dissolving popularity of the Ninja Turtles, and the franchise would remain in limbo for years to come. Left with a disappointing movie four years past and virtually no place on television, the TMNT franchise would face a halt in action figure production for several years.\n\n==2003\u20132012==\nOn February 8, 2003, Fox revived the TMNT franchise with a brand new [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series)|cartoon series]].  With it inevitably came a series of action figures.  These figures showed reminiscence of those released in 1988 yet with the refreshed design of the new, bold look of the cartoon series. Unlike the previous figures, most of the figures released in this collection actually appeared in the 2003 series. This collection successfully continued into 2006 with new character designs and even an occasional revisiting of past concepts like 1993's ''Cave-Turtles''. In 2006, by request of Playmates, the cartoon series took a new lighter direction which brought ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fast Forward]]'', a futuristic take on the heroic mutants. Playmates thought of this change as a means of selling more new Turtles action figures.\n\nMarch 2007 introduced fans to a new [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] feature film entitled simply [[TMNT (film)|''TMNT'']]. This introduced the Ninja Turtles on-screen to a new generation and corresponded with an extensive action figure line. New figures based on the film continued to be produced into the following year.\n\nIn September 2007, it was announced that the collectible figure company [[National Entertainment Collectibles Association|NECA]] had acquired the license to produce Ninja Turtle figures based on their character likenesses from the original Mirage comic books. The first wave of figures consisted of the four Turtles and was released in comic and specialty stores in early 2008. The New York Comic Con also boasted an exclusive figure four-pack, and that same year, NECA released black & white versions of the Turtles just as they appeared in the pages of the comics.<ref>Cochran, Jay [http://toynewsi.com/news.php?catid=20&itemid=12381 Black & White Teenage Mutant Turtle Figures Coming From NECA] TNI News (January 23, 2008).

The settlers, consisting of fifteen men, eleven women, and six children, all came from [[Jefferson County, New York]]. In 1823, Musgrove Evans had located the land and persuaded General [[Joseph W.

These founders appealed to Governor Cass to locate the county seat of Lenawee at Tecumseh. This was accomplished by an act of the Territorial Legislature on June 30, 1824, even though county government would not be organized for another year and a half.

Tecumseh is about {{convert|60|mi|km}} southwest of Detroit, {{convert|25|mi|km}} south of Ann Arbor, and {{convert|40|mi|km}} north of [[Toledo, Ohio]].\n\nAs of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city has a population of 8,521. The city is surrounded on three sides by [[Tecumseh Township, Michigan|Tecumseh Township]], but the two are politically independent. [[Raisin Charter Township, Michigan|Raisin Township]] borders the southern edge of the city. The city was rated #93 in 2009, as one of 100 of the best small towns to live in by [[CNNMoney]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2009/|title=Best Places to Live 2009 - from Money Magazine|website=money.cnn.com}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe boundaries of Lenawee County were laid out by a proclamation of the [[Michigan Territory|Territorial Governor]], [[Lewis Cass]] on September 10, 1822.<ref name=\"Our City\">{{cite web|url= http://www.mytecumseh.org/Our-City/our-city.html|title= Our City|publisher= City of Tecumesh|accessdate= February 23, 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140228063928/http://www.mytecumseh.org/Our-City/our-city.html|archive-date= February 28, 2014|url-status= dead}}</ref> Lenawee remained attached to [[Monroe County, Michigan|Monroe County]], out of which it was formed, until an act of the Territorial Legislature passed on December 26, 1826, organized the county government.\n\nThe first settlement in the county was made two years earlier, on May 21, 1824, in Tecumseh. The settlers, consisting of fifteen men, eleven women, and six children, all came from [[Jefferson County, New York]]. In 1823, Musgrove Evans had located the land and persuaded General [[Joseph W. Brown]] and the others to move to the site. Brown and Evans, along with [[Austin Eli Wing]] purchased land there and platted the village of Tecumseh in 1824. These founders appealed to Governor Cass to locate the county seat of Lenawee at Tecumseh. This was accomplished by an act of the Territorial Legislature on June 30, 1824, even though county government would not be organized for another year and a half. The city was named after the [[Shawnee]] chief [[Tecumseh]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=22164|title= Tecumseh|publisher= ePodunk|accessdate= February 24, 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140228083848/http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=22164|archive-date= February 28, 2014|url-status= dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Elliott 2008 75\">{{cite book|last=Elliott|first=Michael A.|title=Custerology: The Enduring Legacy of the Indian Wars and George Armstrong Custer|date=2008|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=75|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cpjYkhUbbKsC&pg=PA73&dq=A+horse,+Don+Juan,+that+belonged+to+General+%5B%5BGeorge+Armstrong+Custer%5D%5D+is+buried+in+Tecumseh,#v=onepage&q=Don%20Juan%20Tecumseh%2C&f=false|isbn=9780226201481}}</ref>\n\nTecumseh remained the county seat until 1838, when it was transferred to [[Adrian, Michigan|Adrian]].

Some [[real-time strategy]] (RTS) games as well as most [[turn-based strategy]] (TBS) games employ this type of tech tree. In these games, players typically have a 'command center', 'unit-training-facility' and 'research facility' at their disposal from the start, allowing them to both start research into more advanced technologies, or engaging in combat with enemies using the basic units (''[[Warzone 2100]]'', ''[[Mega Lo Mania]]'', ''[[Master of Orion]]'' series, ''[[Civilization (computer game)|Civilization]]'' series, ''[[Space Empires]]'' series).\n\n===Allocation===\nIn some games, the requirement of an actual research facility is absent. In this case players can allocate research points, or in-game resources to purchase new technologies. In some games the allocation yields direct results, meaning that procuring the new technology isn't paired with allotted time for the research of said technology to complete.\n===Building-based===\nIn most RTS games the technology tree consists of buildings which must be built in a specific sequence, which in turn unlocks new technologies. These newly unlocked technologies can be more advanced units, upgrades for research or more advanced buildings. (''[[StarCraft]]'', ''[[Command & Conquer]]'' series.)\n\n===Prerequisites for technology advances===\nIn most types of strategy games, the player needs particular buildings in order to research specific technologies or build specific advanced units (''[[StarCraft]]'', ''[[Total Annihilation]]''), while in other games upgrades/technologies are unlocked through research of their parent technology research (''[[Warzone 2100]]'').

Most TBSs make all technologies available to all cultures (e.g. ''[[Civilization (series)|Civilization]]''). ''[[Master of Orion]]'' (original version) is a complex special case in this respect: the full tree is the same for all; but in each game each player gets a subset of the full tech tree that depends on which race was selected.\n\n===Balance between civilian and military techs===\nIn many RTS games tech advances are almost exclusively military (e.g. ''[[StarCraft]]''). But in most TBS and some RTS games the research and production costs of top-end military techs are so high that you have to build up your economy and your research productivity first (RTS \u2013 ''[[Age of Empires]]'' and ''[[Empire Earth]]'', where one of the most significant costs is going up an epoch; TBS \u2013 the ''[[Civilization (series)|Civilization]]'' series and ''[[Master of Orion]]'' series).\n\n===What happens after researching everything ===\nIn many games there's nothing useful to do and the player may scrap research centers to save maintenance costs and/or devote the resources to something else (''[[Space Empires]]'' series).\n\nIn later installments of the ''[[Civilization (series)|Civilization]]'' series the last technology (called \"future tech\") represents an amalgamation of all possible future discoveries and can be researched repeatedly. In ''[[Civilization V]]'', it increases a player's score, while in ''[[Civilization IV]]'' it raises the health and the happiness in the empire. Note that to reach the last technology in Civilization V, all spaceship technologies required to win must also have been discovered, so the game will likely be nearing its conclusion.\n\nIn the ''[[Galactic Civilizations]]'' series the final technology solves the nature of existence, and ''is'' victory.\n\nIn the ''[[Master of Orion]]'' series more advanced research reduces the size and cost of spaceship components, and \"hyper-advanced\" research in areas which have military applications therefore enables players to build more high-tech weapons into a given ship size and at lower production cost.\n\nIn ''[[Rise of Nations]]'', the final four technologies result in such an advantage that the game will likely end quickly. Also, the \"knowledge\" resource needed to research is also used late in the game to produce cruise missiles and nuclear weapons.\n\n== History ==\nTypically the board game ''[[Civilization (1980 board game)|Civilization]]'' by [[Francis Tresham (game designer)|Francis Tresham]] (1980) is given the credit of introducing a technology tree. ''[[Civilization (video game)|Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization]]'' (1991) is considered as an iconic computer [[turn-based strategy]] game for using them. Since ''Civilization'', technology trees have been used in various digital games{{sfn|Heinim\u00e4ki|2015|p=21}}. Likewise, the first creation of a technology tree as a mechanism refers to ''Civilization''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ghys|first1=Tuur|title=Technology Trees: Freedom and Determinism in Historical Strategy Games|url=http://gamestudies.org/1201/articles/tuur_ghys|website=gamestudies.org|accessdate=13 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe arcade shoot 'em up ''[[Gradius (video game)|Gradius]]'' used a power-up system functionally identical to a tech tree in 1985{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}.\n\nTech trees started showing up in [[turn-based strategy]] games in the early 1990s{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}.

Most TBSs make all technologies available to all cultures (e.g. ''[[Civilization (series)|Civilization]]''). ''[[Master of Orion]]'' (original version) is a complex special case in this respect: the full tree is the same for all; but in each game each player gets a subset of the full tech tree that depends on which race was selected.\n\n===Balance between civilian and military techs===\nIn many RTS games tech advances are almost exclusively military (e.g. ''[[StarCraft]]''). But in most TBS and some RTS games the research and production costs of top-end military techs are so high that you have to build up your economy and your research productivity first (RTS \u2013 ''[[Age of Empires]]'' and ''[[Empire Earth]]'', where one of the most significant costs is going up an epoch; TBS \u2013 the ''[[Civilization (series)|Civilization]]'' series and ''[[Master of Orion]]'' series).\n\n===What happens after researching everything ===\nIn many games there's nothing useful to do and the player may scrap research centers to save maintenance costs and/or devote the resources to something else (''[[Space Empires]]'' series).\n\nIn later installments of the ''[[Civilization (series)|Civilization]]'' series the last technology (called \"future tech\") represents an amalgamation of all possible future discoveries and can be researched repeatedly. In ''[[Civilization V]]'', it increases a player's score, while in ''[[Civilization IV]]'' it raises the health and the happiness in the empire. Note that to reach the last technology in Civilization V, all spaceship technologies required to win must also have been discovered, so the game will likely be nearing its conclusion.\n\nIn the ''[[Galactic Civilizations]]'' series the final technology solves the nature of existence, and ''is'' victory.\n\nIn the ''[[Master of Orion]]'' series more advanced research reduces the size and cost of spaceship components, and \"hyper-advanced\" research in areas which have military applications therefore enables players to build more high-tech weapons into a given ship size and at lower production cost.\n\nIn ''[[Rise of Nations]]'', the final four technologies result in such an advantage that the game will likely end quickly. Also, the \"knowledge\" resource needed to research is also used late in the game to produce cruise missiles and nuclear weapons.\n\n== History ==\nTypically the board game ''[[Civilization (1980 board game)|Civilization]]'' by [[Francis Tresham (game designer)|Francis Tresham]] (1980) is given the credit of introducing a technology tree. ''[[Civilization (video game)|Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization]]'' (1991) is considered as an iconic computer [[turn-based strategy]] game for using them. Since ''Civilization'', technology trees have been used in various digital games{{sfn|Heinim\u00e4ki|2015|p=21}}. Likewise, the first creation of a technology tree as a mechanism refers to ''Civilization''<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ghys|first1=Tuur|title=Technology Trees: Freedom and Determinism in Historical Strategy Games|url=http://gamestudies.org/1201/articles/tuur_ghys|website=gamestudies.org|accessdate=13 November 2017}}</ref>.\n\nThe arcade shoot 'em up ''[[Gradius (video game)|Gradius]]'' used a power-up system functionally identical to a tech tree in 1985{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}.\n\nTech trees started showing up in [[turn-based strategy]] games in the early 1990s{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}. The 1991 video game ''[[Mega Lo Mania]]'' had a tech tree with a system of research levels/epochs that allowed the deployment of better units and defences and is considered to be the first game to combine a technology tree into a ''[[Real-time strategy]]'' game.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of historic inventions]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last = Heinim\u00e4ki |first = Teemu J. |chapter= |pages = |title = Technology Trees and Tools: Constructing Development Graphs for Digital Games - dissertation |publisher=[[Tampere University of Technology]] |volume = 1349 |location = [[Tampere]], [[Finland]] |ISBN = 9789521536335 |year = 2015 |ref = harv |url = https://tutcris.tut.fi/portal/files/4265122/heinimaki_1349.pdf }}\n{{refend}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{Real-time strategy gameplay}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Technology Tree}}\n[[Category:Video game gameplay]]\n[[Category:Application-specific graphs]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_tree"}

The human actor, the entrepreneur is seen as the cause of economic development which occurs as a cyclical process.  [[Schumpeter]] proposed that radical innovations were the catalyst for Kondratiev cycles.\n\n===Long wave theory===\nThe Russian economist Kondratiev<ref>Kondratiev, N., 1925. Major Economic Cycles. Moscow.</ref> proposed that economic growth operated in boom and bust cycles of approximately 50 year periods. These cycles were characterised by periods of expansion, stagnation and recession. The period of expansion is associated with the introduction of a new technology, e.g. steam power or the microprocessor. At the time of publication, [[Kondratiev]] had considered that two cycles had occurred in the nineteenth century and third was beginning at the turn of the twentieth. Modern writers, such as Freeman and Perez<ref name=\"Freeman\">Freeman, C. and Perez, C., 1988. Structural crisis of adjustment, business cycles and investment behaviour in Dosi et al Technical Change and Economic Theory. London: Frances Pinter. pp. 38-66.</ref> outlined five cycles in the modern age:\n\n* [[The Industrial Revolution]] (1770\u20131830)\n* Victorian Prosperity: Age of steam and Rail (1830\u20131880)\n* The Age of Steel (1880\u20131930)\n* Oil, Mass Production and the Consumer Society (1930\u20131980)\n* The Information Age (1980-?)\n\nFreeman and Perez<ref name=\"Freeman\" /> proposed that each cycle consists of pervasive technologies, their production and economic structures that support them. Termed \u2018techno-economic paradigms\u2019, they suggest that the shift from one paradigm to another is the result of emergent new technologies. \n\nFollowing the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|recent economic crisis]], authors such as Moody and Nogrady<ref>Moody, J.B., and Nogrady, B., 2011. The Sixth Wave: How to Succeed in a Resource-Limited World. New York: Random House</ref> have suggested that a new cycle is emerging from the old, centred on the use of sustainable technologies in a resource depleted world.\n\n===Technological paradigms, trajectories and regimes===\n[[Thomas Kuhn]]<ref>Kuhn, T., 1962. The structure of scientific revolutions. Chicago; London : University of Chicago Press</ref> described how a paradigm shift is a wholesale shift in the basic understanding of a scientific theory. Examples in science include the change of thought from miasma to germ theory as a cause of disease.  Building on this work, [[Giovanni Dosi]]<ref>Dosi, G., 1982. Technological paradigms and technological trajectories. Research Policy 11 (3) pp. 147-162.</ref> developed the concept of \u2019technical paradigms\u2019 and \u2018technological trajectories\u2019.  In considering how engineers work, the technical paradigm is an outlook on the technological problem, a definition of what the problems and solutions are. It charts the idea of specific progress. By identifying the problems to be solved the paradigm exerts an influence on technological change. The pattern of problem solving activity and the direction of progress is the technological trajectory.  In similar fashion, Nelson and Winter (,<ref>Nelson, R.R., Winter, S.G., 1977. In search of useful theory of innovation. Research Policy 6 (1) pp. 36-76</ref><ref>Nelson, R.R., Winter, S.G., 1982. An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change. Cambridge (MA); Bellknap Press.</ref>)defined the concept of the \u2018technological regime\u2019 which directs technological change through the beliefs of engineers of what problems to solve. The work of the actors and organisations is the result of organisational and cognitive routines which determines search behaviour. This places boundaries and also trajectories (direction) to those boundaries.\n\n==Multi-level perspective (MLP) on technological transitions==\n===Socio-technical systems and transitions===\n\nRecently, the scope of academic sustainability discourse and investigative focus has broadened beyond the study of technological products, innovations and subsequent transitions <ref>(Geels 2005)</ref>. Much of the literature now examines technological artefacts and innovations through a wider scope of socio-technical systems <ref>(Geels 2018)</ref>. It has been argued that this contemporary framework has emerged in response to both an increased understanding of the urgency of environmental problems and the recognition that more substantiative transitions are required across multiple interdependent systems to mitigate impacts <ref>(Geels 2010)</ref>.\n\nThe technological transitions framework does acknowledge the co-evolution and mutual unfolding of societal change alongside technological innovation. However, the socio-technical transitions framework considers a more encompassing view of the interdependent links that technology maintains with systems that both generate the need for new innovations and ultimately produce and maintain them (.<ref>Geels 2005, 2010)</ref> More specifically, the systems that comprise the socio-technical paradigm include technology, supply networks, infrastructure, maintenance networks, regulation, cultural meaning as well as user practices and markets <ref>(Geels 2018, Geels 2005)</ref>. As such, socio-technical transitions can be defined as the multi-dimensional shift from one socio-technical system to another involving changes in both technological and social systems that are intrinsically linked in a feedback loop <ref>(Geels 2005)</ref>. Generally speaking, socio-technical transitions are a slow process as technological innovation tends to occur incrementally along fixed trajectories due to the rigidity of economic, social, cultural, infrastructural and regulative norms <ref>(Geels 2005, Twomey and Gaziulusoy 2014)</ref>. This is referred to as path dependency, creating technological \u2018lock-ins\u2019 which prevent innovation that disrupts the status quo <ref>(Twomey and Gaziulusoy 2014)</ref>. Therefore, the breakthrough and dissemination of technological innovations is dependent on more than their respective benefits, providing an insight into the complexity of the forces and multiple dimensions at play. \n\n===Multi-level perspective (MLP) framework===\nThe multi-level perspective (MLP) is an analytical tool that attempts to deal with this complexity and resistance to change. Focussing on the dynamics of wider transitionary developments as opposed to discrete technological innovations, the MLP concerns itself with socio-technical system transformations, particularly with transitions towards sustainability and resilience <ref>(Geels 2010, Twomey and Gaziulusoy 2014)</ref>. As the name implies, the MLP posits three analytical and heuristic levels on which processes interact and align to result in socio-technical system transformations; '''landscape (macro-level), regimes (meso-level) and niches (micro-level)''' <ref>(Twomey and Gaziulusoy 2014, Geels 2018)</ref>. Firstly, the '''regime''' level represents the current structures and practices characterised by dominant rules, institutions and technologies that are self-reinforcing <ref>(Geels 2010, 2018, Twomey and Gaziulusoy 2014)</ref>. The socio-technical regime is dynamically stable in the sense that innovation still transpires albeit incrementally and along a predictable trajectory <ref>(Geels 2005)</ref>. This makes the regime \u2018locked-in\u2019 and resistant to both technological and social transitions <ref>(Kemp, Schot, and Hoogma 1998, Twomey and Gaziulusoy 2014)</ref>. Secondly, the '''landscape''' level is defined as the exogenous, broader contextual developments in deep-seated cultural patterns, macro-economics, macro-politics and spatial structures, potentially arising from shocks associated with wars, economic crisis, natural disaster and political upheaval <ref>(Geels 2018, Geels 2005, Twomey and Gaziulusoy 2014)</ref>. Additionally, landscapes are beyond the direct influence of actors, yet stimulate and exert pressure on them at the regime and niche levels. Finally, the '''niche''' is defined as the \u201clocus for radical innovations\u201d where dedicated actors nurture the development of technological novelties <ref>(Geels 2010, Geels 2005)</ref>. Incubated from market and regulation influences, the niche fosters innovations that differ fundamentally from the prevailing regime and usually require landscape developments that open windows of opportunity in at the regime level <ref>(Geels 2005, Twomey and Gaziulusoy 2014)</ref>. Therefore, the MLP attributes socio-technical transitions to the interaction of stabilising forces at the regime level with destabilising forces from both the landscape and niche levels <ref>(Twomey and Gaziulusoy 2014)</ref>. \n\n===MLP application - automobility regime===\n\nDue to the systems approach inherent in the MLP, analysis can be approached from different disciplinary perspectives according to their respective ontologies and priorities. From an urban planning perspective, the framework could be used to pinpoint the barriers and drivers associated with low carbon transport systems to better target policy efforts <ref>(Moradi and Vagnoni 2018)</ref>. To begin, from an urban mobility perspective, the landscape level is currently pressured by both stabilising and destabilising pressures. Namely, Peak Oil, public concern surrounding inaction towards climate change mitigation and information technologies that digitise daily life (e.g. tele-commuting) destabilises the landscape and automobility regime <ref>(Geels 2012, Moradi and Vagnoni 2018)</ref>. Conversely, the landscape level is solidified by stabilising forces such as cultural preferences for private ownership, timesaving, autonomy and privacy, as well as car-favouring urban fabric and infrastructure <ref>(Geels 2012)</ref>. This is further enhanced by universal pressures of globalisation which presupposes urban mobility to increase flows of goods and people <ref>(Geels 2012, Moradi and Vagnoni 2018)</ref>.\n \nThis tension between stabilising and destabilising forces is mirrored in the prevailing automobility regime. The regime is stabilised by persistent investment in road projects, lifestyle norms and consumer preferences that perpetuate car use and resistance to major change by vested actors such as transport planners, policy makers and industry actors (e.g. car manufactures) <ref>(Geels 2012)</ref>. Despite this stability, shifts in the landscape has allowed \u201ccracks\u201d in the regime such as traffic management policy (traffic calming, parking restrictions, etc.), diminishing policy commitment to the regime and industry actors proclaiming awareness of landscape pressures associated with climate change <ref>(Geels 2012).</ref> \n\nIn these contexts, niche socio-technical innovations that challenge the assumptions and norms of the regime have been birthed, mainly in the form of local policy and infrastructure initiatives on a city-scale. For example, intermodal travel in the form of bus/bike-rail integration schemes, bike rental/sharing have been trialled in many cities globally <ref>(Geels 2012)</ref>. Also, niche sustainable urban planning concepts such as compact cities, smart growth and transit-oriented development have modestly emerged into sustainably mobility discourse <ref>(Geels 2012)</ref>. However, the persistence of the automobility regime due to the general stability of the landscape has resulted in limited, small-scale implementations of these niche innovations <ref>(Geels 2012)</ref>. As such, prevailing user preference and cultural values at the landscape level appear to be a major barrier in transport system socio-technical transitions, as they stabilise the automobility regime, disallowing niche innovations to gain a foothold.\n\n==Transition paths==\nThe nature of transitions varies and the differing qualities result in multiple pathways occurring. Geels and Schot <ref>Geels, F.W. and Schot, J.W., 2007, 'Typology of sociotechnical transition pathways , Research Policy, 36 (3), pp.399-417</ref> defined five transition paths:\n\n* Reproduction: Ongoing change occurring in the regime level.\n* Transformation:  A socio-technical regime that changes without the emergence of a monopolising technology.\n* Technological substitution: An incumbent technology is replaced by a radical innovation resulting in a new socio-technical regime. \n* De-alignment and Re-alignment: Weaknesses in the regime sees the advent of competing new technologies leading to a dominant model. (E.g. the automobile replacing the horse as the primary means of land transport).\n* Re-configuration: When multiple, interlinked technologies are replaced by a similarly linked alternative set.\n\n==Characteristics of technological transitions==\nSix characteristics of technological transitions have been identified.,<ref name=\"Evans\" /><ref>Geels, F., Monaghan, A., Eames, M. and Steward, F. , 2008. The feasibility of systems thinking in sustainable consumption and production policy: a report to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, London: DEFRA.</ref>\n\n''Transitions are co-evolutionary and multi-dimensional''\nTechnological developments occur intertwined with societal needs, wants and uses. A technology is adopted and diffused based on this interplay between innovation and societal requirements. Co-evolution has different aspects. As well as the co-evolution of technology and society, aspects between science, technology, users and culture have been considered.<ref name=\"Geels_a\" />\n \n''Multi-actors are involved''\nScientific and engineering communities are central to the development of a technology, but a wide range of actors are involved in a transition. This can include organisations, policy-makers, government, NGOs, special interest groups and others.\n\n''Transitions occur at multiple levels''\nAs shown in the MLP transitions occur through the interplay of processes at different levels. \n\n''Transitions are a long-term process''\nComplete system-change takes time and can be decades in the making. Case studies show them to be between 40 and 90 years.<ref name=\"Genus\">Genus , A., and Coles, A-M., 2008. Rethinking the multi-level perspective of technological transitions. Research Policy. 37 (9) pp. 1436-1445</ref>\n\n''Transitions are radical''\nFor a true transition to occur the technology has to be a radical innovation.  \n\n''Change is Non-linear''\nThe rate of change will vary over time. For example, the pace of change may be slow at the gestation period (at the niche level) but much more rapid when a breakthrough is occurring.\n\n==Diffusion: transition phases==\nDiffusion of an innovation is the concept of how it is picked up by society, at what rate and why.<ref>Everett (1962)</ref> The diffusion of a technological innovation into society can be considered in distinct phases.<ref name=\"Rotmans\">Rotmans, J., Kemp, R. and van Asselt, M. 2001. More evolution than revolution: transition management in public policy. Foresight, 3 (1) pp. 15\u201331.</ref> Pre-development is the gestation period where the new technology has yet to make an impact. Take-off is when the process of a system shift is beginning. A breakthrough is occurring when fundamental changes are occurring in existing structures through the interplay of economic, social and cultural forces. Once the rate of change has decreased and a new balance is achieved, stabilization is said to have occurred. A full transition involves an overhaul of existing rules and change of beliefs which takes time, typically spanning at least a generation.<ref name=\"Rotmans\" /> This process can be speeded up through seismic, unforeseen events such as war or economic strife. \n\nGeels<ref name=\"Geels_a\" /> proposed a similar four-phase approach which draws on the multi-level perspective (MLP) developed by Dutch scholars. Phase one sees the emergence of a novelty, born from the existing regime. Development then occurs in the niche level at phase two.  As before, breakthrough then occurs at phase three. In the parlance of the MLP the new technology, having been developed at the niche level, is in competition with the established regime. To break through and achieve wide diffusion, external factors \u2013 \u2018windows of opportunity\u2019 \u2013 are required.\n\n==Windows of opportunity==\nA number of possible circumstances can act as windows of opportunity for the diffusion of new technologies: \n\n* Internal technical problems in the existing regime. Those that cannot be solved by refinement of existing technologies act as a driver for the new.\n* Problems external to the system. Such \u2018problems\u2019 are often determined by pressure groups and require wider societal or political backing. An example is environmental concerns.\n* Changing user preferences. Opportunities are presented if existing technologies cannot meet user needs.\n* Strategic advantage. Competition with rivals may necessitate innovation\n* Complementary technology. The availability of which may enable a breakthrough\n\nAlongside external influences, internal drivers catalyse diffusion.<ref name=\"Geels_a\" /> These include economic factors such as the price performance ration. Socio-technical perspectives focus on the links between disparate social and technological elements.<ref name=\"Rip\">Rip, A. and R. Kemp., 1998. Technological change. In S. Rayner and E. Malone\n(eds.) Human Choices and Climate Change, Vol. 2, 327-399. Battelle, Columbus,Ohio.</ref> Following the breakthrough, the final phases see the new technology supersede the old.\n\n==Societal relevance==\nThe study of technological transitions has an impact beyond academic interest. The transitions referred to in the literature may relate to historic processes, such as the transportation transitions studied by Geels, but system changes are required to achieve a safe transition to a low carbon-economy. (<ref name=\"Evans\" /><ref name=\"Geels_a\" />). Current structural problems are apparent in a range of sectors.<ref name=\"Geels_a\" />  Dependency on oil is problematic in the energy sector due to availability, access and contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Transportation is a major user of energy causing significant emission of GHGs.  Food production will need to keep pace with an ever-growing world population while overcoming challenges presented by global warming and transportation issues. Incremental change has provided some improvements but a more radical transition is required to achieve a more sustainable future. \n\nDeveloped from the work on technological transitions is the field of transition management. Within this is an attempt to shape the direction of change complex socio-technical systems to more sustainable patterns.<ref name=\"Evans\" /> Whereas work on technological transitions is largely based on historic processes, proponents of transition management seek to actively steer transitions in progress.\n\n==Criticisms==\nGenus and Coles<ref name=\"Genus\" /> outlined a number of criticisms against the analysis of technological transitions, in particular when using the MLP. Empirical research on technological transitions occurring now has been limited, with the focus on historic transitions. Depending on the perspective on transition case studies they could be presented as having occurred on a different transition path to what was shown. For example, the bicycle could be considered an intermediate transport technology between the horse and the car. Judged from shorter different time-frame this could appear a transition in its own right. Determining the nature of a transition is problematic; when it started and ended, or whether one occurred in the sense of a radical innovation displacing an existing socio-technical regime. The perception of time casts doubt on whether a transition has occurred. If viewed over a long enough period even inert regimes may demonstrate radical change in the end. The MLP has also been criticised by scholars studying sustainability transitions using Social Practice Theories.<ref>Shove E, Walker G, 2007, \"CAUTION! Transitions ahead: politics, practice, and sustainable transition management\" Environment and Planning A 39(4) 763-770</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Evolutionary economics]]\n* [[Kondratiev wave]]\n* [[Technological change]]\n* [[Technological innovation system]]\n* [[Technology policy]]\n* [[Technological revolution]]\n* [[Transition Management (Governance)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{Science and technology studies}}\n\n[[Category:Science and technology studies]]\n[[Category:Technological change]]\n", "text_old": "{{lead|date=March 2020}}\n'''Technological innovations'' have occurred throughout history and rapidly increased over the modern age.

Technological paradigms and technological trajectories. Research Policy 11 (3) pp. 147-162.</ref> developed the concept of \u2019technical paradigms\u2019 and \u2018technological trajectories\u2019.  In considering how engineers work, the technical paradigm is an outlook on the technological problem, a definition of what the problems and solutions are. It charts the idea of specific progress. By identifying the problems to be solved the paradigm exerts an influence on technological change. The pattern of problem solving activity and the direction of progress is the technological trajectory.  In similar fashion, Nelson and Winter (,<ref>Nelson, R.R., Winter, S.G., 1977. In search of useful theory of innovation. Research Policy 6 (1) pp. 36-76</ref><ref>Nelson, R.R., Winter, S.G., 1982. An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change. Cambridge (MA); Bellknap Press.</ref>)defined the concept of the \u2018technological regime\u2019 which directs technological change through the beliefs of engineers of what problems to solve. The work of the actors and organisations is the result of organisational and cognitive routines which determines search behaviour. This places boundaries and also trajectories (direction) to those boundaries.\n\n==Multi-level perspective (MLP) on technological transitions==\n===Socio-technical systems and transitions===\n\nRecently, the scope of academic sustainability discourse and investigative focus has broadened beyond the study of technological products, innovations and subsequent transitions <ref>(Geels 2005)</ref>. Much of the literature now examines technological artefacts and innovations through a wider scope of socio-technical systems <ref>(Geels 2018)</ref>. It has been argued that this contemporary framework has emerged in response to both an increased understanding of the urgency of environmental problems and the recognition that more substantiative transitions are required across multiple interdependent systems to mitigate impacts <ref>(Geels 2010)</ref>.\n\nThe technological transitions framework does acknowledge the co-evolution and mutual unfolding of societal change alongside technological innovation. However, the socio-technical transitions framework considers a more encompassing view of the interdependent links that technology maintains with systems that both generate the need for new innovations and ultimately produce and maintain them (<ref>Geels 2005, 2010)</ref>. More specifically, the systems that comprise the socio-technical paradigm include technology, supply networks, infrastructure, maintenance networks, regulation, cultural meaning as well as user practices and markets <ref>(Geels 2018, Geels 2005)</ref>. As such, socio-technical transitions can be defined as the multi-dimensional shift from one socio-technical system to another involving changes in both technological and social systems that are intrinsically linked in a feedback loop <ref>(Geels 2005)</ref>. Generally speaking, socio-technical transitions are a slow process as technological innovation tends to occur incrementally along fixed trajectories due to the rigidity of economic, social, cultural, infrastructural and regulative norms <ref>(Geels 2005, Twomey and Gaziulusoy 2014)</ref>. This is referred to as path dependency, creating technological \u2018lock-ins\u2019 which prevent innovation that disrupts the status quo <ref>(Twomey and Gaziulusoy 2014)</ref>. Therefore, the breakthrough and dissemination of technological innovations is dependent on more than their respective benefits, providing an insight into the complexity of the forces and multiple dimensions at play. \n\n===Multi-level perspective (MLP) framework===\nThe multi-level perspective (MLP) is an analytical tool that attempts to deal with this complexity and resistance to change. Focussing on the dynamics of wider transitionary developments as opposed to discrete technological innovations, the MLP concerns itself with socio-technical system transformations, particularly with transitions towards sustainability and resilience <ref>(Geels 2010, Twomey and Gaziulusoy 2014)</ref>. As the name implies, the MLP posits three analytical and heuristic levels on which processes interact and align to result in socio-technical system transformations; '''landscape (macro-level), regimes (meso-level) and niches (micro-level)''' <ref>(Twomey and Gaziulusoy 2014, Geels 2018)</ref>. Firstly, the '''regime''' level represents the current structures and practices characterised by dominant rules, institutions and technologies that are self-reinforcing <ref>(Geels 2010, 2018, Twomey and Gaziulusoy 2014)</ref>. The socio-technical regime is dynamically stable in the sense that innovation still transpires albeit incrementally and along a predictable trajectory <ref>(Geels 2005)</ref>. This makes the regime \u2018locked-in\u2019 and resistant to both technological and social transitions <ref>(Kemp, Schot, and Hoogma 1998, Twomey and Gaziulusoy 2014)</ref>. Secondly, the '''landscape''' level is defined as the exogenous, broader contextual developments in deep-seated cultural patterns, macro-economics, macro-politics and spatial structures, potentially arising from shocks associated with wars, economic crisis, natural disaster and political upheaval <ref>(Geels 2018, Geels 2005, Twomey and Gaziulusoy 2014)</ref>. Additionally, landscapes are beyond the direct influence of actors, yet stimulate and exert pressure on them at the regime and niche levels. Finally, the '''niche''' is defined as the \u201clocus for radical innovations\u201d where dedicated actors nurture the development of technological novelties <ref>(Geels 2010, Geels 2005)</ref>. Incubated from market and regulation influences, the niche fosters innovations that differ fundamentally from the prevailing regime and usually require landscape developments that open windows of opportunity in at the regime level <ref>(Geels 2005, Twomey and Gaziulusoy 2014)</ref>. Therefore, the MLP attributes socio-technical transitions to the interaction of stabilising forces at the regime level with destabilising forces from both the landscape and niche levels <ref>(Twomey and Gaziulusoy 2014)</ref>. \n\n===MLP application - automobility regime===\n\nDue to the systems approach inherent in the MLP, analysis can be approached from different disciplinary perspectives according to their respective ontologies and priorities. From an urban planning perspective, the framework could be used to pinpoint the barriers and drivers associated with low carbon transport systems to better target policy efforts <ref>(Moradi and Vagnoni 2018)</ref>. To begin, from an urban mobility perspective, the landscape level is currently pressured by both stabilising and destabilising pressures. Namely, Peak Oil, public concern surrounding inaction towards climate change mitigation and information technologies that digitise daily life (e.g. tele-commuting) destabilises the landscape and automobility regime <ref>(Geels 2012, Moradi and Vagnoni 2018)</ref>. Conversely, the landscape level is solidified by stabilising forces such as cultural preferences for private ownership, timesaving, autonomy and privacy, as well as car-favouring urban fabric and infrastructure <ref>(Geels 2012)</ref>. This is further enhanced by universal pressures of globalisation which presupposes urban mobility to increase flows of goods and people <ref>(Geels 2012, Moradi and Vagnoni 2018)</ref>.\n \nThis tension between stabilising and destabilising forces is mirrored in the prevailing automobility regime. The regime is stabilised by persistent investment in road projects, lifestyle norms and consumer preferences that perpetuate car use and resistance to major change by vested actors such as transport planners, policy makers and industry actors (e.g. car manufactures) <ref>(Geels 2012)</ref>. Despite this stability, shifts in the landscape has allowed \u201ccracks\u201d in the regime such as traffic management policy (traffic calming, parking restrictions, etc.), diminishing policy commitment to the regime and industry actors proclaiming awareness of landscape pressures associated with climate change <ref>(Geels 2012).</ref> \n\nIn these contexts, niche socio-technical innovations that challenge the assumptions and norms of the regime have been birthed, mainly in the form of local policy and infrastructure initiatives on a city-scale. For example, intermodal travel in the form of bus/bike-rail integration schemes, bike rental/sharing have been trialled in many cities globally <ref>(Geels 2012)</ref>. Also, niche sustainable urban planning concepts such as compact cities, smart growth and transit-oriented development have modestly emerged into sustainably mobility discourse <ref>(Geels 2012)</ref>. However, the persistence of the automobility regime due to the general stability of the landscape has resulted in limited, small-scale implementations of these niche innovations <ref>(Geels 2012)</ref>. As such, prevailing user preference and cultural values at the landscape level appear to be a major barrier in transport system socio-technical transitions, as they stabilise the automobility regime, disallowing niche innovations to gain a foothold.\n\n==Transition paths==\nThe nature of transitions varies and the differing qualities result in multiple pathways occurring. Geels and Schot <ref>Geels, F.W. and Schot, J.W., 2007, 'Typology of sociotechnical transition pathways , Research Policy, 36 (3), pp.399-417</ref> defined five transition paths:\n\n* Reproduction: Ongoing change occurring in the regime level.\n* Transformation:  A socio-technical regime that changes without the emergence of a monopolising technology.\n* Technological substitution: An incumbent technology is replaced by a radical innovation resulting in a new socio-technical regime. \n* De-alignment and Re-alignment: Weaknesses in the regime sees the advent of competing new technologies leading to a dominant model. (E.g. the automobile replacing the horse as the primary means of land transport).\n* Re-configuration: When multiple, interlinked technologies are replaced by a similarly linked alternative set.\n\n==Characteristics of technological transitions==\nSix characteristics of technological transitions have been identified.,<ref name=\"Evans\" /><ref>Geels, F., Monaghan, A., Eames, M. and Steward, F. , 2008. The feasibility of systems thinking in sustainable consumption and production policy: a report to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, London: DEFRA.</ref>\n\n''Transitions are co-evolutionary and multi-dimensional''\nTechnological developments occur intertwined with societal needs, wants and uses. A technology is adopted and diffused based on this interplay between innovation and societal requirements. Co-evolution has different aspects. As well as the co-evolution of technology and society, aspects between science, technology, users and culture have been considered.<ref name=\"Geels_a\" />\n \n''Multi-actors are involved''\nScientific and engineering communities are central to the development of a technology, but a wide range of actors are involved in a transition. This can include organisations, policy-makers, government, NGOs, special interest groups and others.\n\n''Transitions occur at multiple levels''\nAs shown in the MLP transitions occur through the interplay of processes at different levels. \n\n''Transitions are a long-term process''\nComplete system-change takes time and can be decades in the making. Case studies show them to be between 40 and 90 years.<ref name=\"Genus\">Genus , A., and Coles, A-M., 2008. Rethinking the multi-level perspective of technological transitions. Research Policy. 37 (9) pp. 1436-1445</ref>\n\n''Transitions are radical''\nFor a true transition to occur the technology has to be a radical innovation.  \n\n''Change is Non-linear''\nThe rate of change will vary over time. For example, the pace of change may be slow at the gestation period (at the niche level) but much more rapid when a breakthrough is occurring.\n\n==Diffusion: transition phases==\nDiffusion of an innovation is the concept of how it is picked up by society, at what rate and why.<ref>Everett (1962)</ref> The diffusion of a technological innovation into society can be considered in distinct phases.<ref name=\"Rotmans\">Rotmans, J., Kemp, R. and van Asselt, M. 2001. More evolution than revolution: transition management in public policy. Foresight, 3 (1) pp. 15\u201331.</ref> Pre-development is the gestation period where the new technology has yet to make an impact. Take-off is when the process of a system shift is beginning. A breakthrough is occurring when fundamental changes are occurring in existing structures through the interplay of economic, social and cultural forces. Once the rate of change has decreased and a new balance is achieved, stabilization is said to have occurred. A full transition involves an overhaul of existing rules and change of beliefs which takes time, typically spanning at least a generation.<ref name=\"Rotmans\" /> This process can be speeded up through seismic, unforeseen events such as war or economic strife. \n\nGeels<ref name=\"Geels_a\" /> proposed a similar four-phase approach which draws on the multi-level perspective (MLP) developed by Dutch scholars. Phase one sees the emergence of a novelty, born from the existing regime. Development then occurs in the niche level at phase two.  As before, breakthrough then occurs at phase three. In the parlance of the MLP the new technology, having been developed at the niche level, is in competition with the established regime. To break through and achieve wide diffusion, external factors \u2013 \u2018windows of opportunity\u2019 \u2013 are required.\n\n==Windows of opportunity==\nA number of possible circumstances can act as windows of opportunity for the diffusion of new technologies: \n\n* Internal technical problems in the existing regime. Those that cannot be solved by refinement of existing technologies act as a driver for the new.\n* Problems external to the system. Such \u2018problems\u2019 are often determined by pressure groups and require wider societal or political backing. An example is environmental concerns.\n* Changing user preferences. Opportunities are presented if existing technologies cannot meet user needs.\n* Strategic advantage. Competition with rivals may necessitate innovation\n* Complementary technology. The availability of which may enable a breakthrough\n\nAlongside external influences, internal drivers catalyse diffusion.<ref name=\"Geels_a\" /> These include economic factors such as the price performance ration. Socio-technical perspectives focus on the links between disparate social and technological elements.<ref name=\"Rip\">Rip, A. and R. Kemp., 1998. Technological change. In S. Rayner and E. Malone\n(eds.) Human Choices and Climate Change, Vol. 2, 327-399. Battelle, Columbus,Ohio.</ref> Following the breakthrough, the final phases see the new technology supersede the old.\n\n==Societal relevance==\nThe study of technological transitions has an impact beyond academic interest. The transitions referred to in the literature may relate to historic processes, such as the transportation transitions studied by Geels, but system changes are required to achieve a safe transition to a low carbon-economy. (<ref name=\"Evans\" /><ref name=\"Geels_a\" />). Current structural problems are apparent in a range of sectors.<ref name=\"Geels_a\" />  Dependency on oil is problematic in the energy sector due to availability, access and contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Transportation is a major user of energy causing significant emission of GHGs.  Food production will need to keep pace with an ever-growing world population while overcoming challenges presented by global warming and transportation issues. Incremental change has provided some improvements but a more radical transition is required to achieve a more sustainable future. \n\nDeveloped from the work on technological transitions is the field of transition management. Within this is an attempt to shape the direction of change complex socio-technical systems to more sustainable patterns.<ref name=\"Evans\" /> Whereas work on technological transitions is largely based on historic processes, proponents of transition management seek to actively steer transitions in progress.\n\n==Criticisms==\nGenus and Coles<ref name=\"Genus\" /> outlined a number of criticisms against the analysis of technological transitions, in particular when using the MLP. Empirical research on technological transitions occurring now has been limited, with the focus on historic transitions. Depending on the perspective on transition case studies they could be presented as having occurred on a different transition path to what was shown. For example, the bicycle could be considered an intermediate transport technology between the horse and the car. Judged from shorter different time-frame this could appear a transition in its own right. Determining the nature of a transition is problematic; when it started and ended, or whether one occurred in the sense of a radical innovation displacing an existing socio-technical regime. The perception of time casts doubt on whether a transition has occurred. If viewed over a long enough period even inert regimes may demonstrate radical change in the end. The MLP has also been criticised by scholars studying sustainability transitions using Social Practice Theories.<ref>Shove E, Walker G, 2007, \"CAUTION! Transitions ahead: politics, practice, and sustainable transition management\" Environment and Planning A 39(4) 763-770</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Evolutionary economics]]\n* [[Kondratiev wave]]\n* [[Technological change]]\n* [[Technological innovation system]]\n* [[Technology policy]]\n* [[Technological revolution]]\n* [[Transition Management (Governance)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{Science and technology studies}}\n\n[[Category:Science and technology studies]]\n[[Category:Technological change]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_transitions"}
