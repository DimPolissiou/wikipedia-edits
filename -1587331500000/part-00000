As is an annual tradition since the [[G1 Climax#2012|2012 G1 Climax]], the winner of the tournament receives the [[G1 Climax#Tokyo Dome IWGP Heavyweight Championship challenge rights certificate|Tokyo Dome IWGP Heavyweight Championship challenge rights certificate]], which grants him a match at the next [[January 4 Tokyo Dome Show|Wrestle Kingdom]] event for the [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship]]. Tanahashi went on to defend the certificate against [[Kazuchika Okada]] on September 23 at [[Destruction (2018)|Destruction in Kobe]] and [[Jay White]] on October 8 at [[King of Pro-Wrestling (2018)|King of Pro-Wrestling]]. Similarly, the IWGP Heavyweight Champion [[Kenny Omega]] went on to defend his title against [[Tomohiro Ishii]] on September 15 at Destruction in Hiroshima and in a three-way match against [[Cody Rhodes|Cody]] and [[Kota Ibushi]] also on October 8 at King of Pro-Wrestling. The match was then officially announced, with Omega defending the title against Tanahashi.\n\nAfter the main event match at New Year Dash!! on January 5, 2018, [[Chris Jericho]] attacked [[Tetsuya Naito]]. Later in the year on April 29 at [[Wrestling Hinokuni#2018|Wrestling Hinokuni]], Naito won the [[IWGP Intercontinental Championship]] by defeating [[Minoru Suzuki]]. On May 4 at night 2 of [[Wrestling Dontaku 2018|Wrestling Dontaku]], Jericho returned to attack Naito again and set a match between the two at [[Dominion 6.9 in Osaka-jo Hall]] for Naito's championship. Jericho went on to defeat Naito and win the title. His first defense was at [[Power Struggle (2018)|Power Struggle]] on November 3 in which Jericho defeated Naito's ''[[Los Ingobernables de Japon]]'' stablemate [[Evil (wrestler)|Evil]]. After the end of the match, Naito went on to save Evil after Jericho's continued assault on him and proceeded to challenge Jericho for the championship. Despite Jericho's refusal, NJPW management went on to announce the match for Wrestle Kingdom 13. At Fan Fest on January 3, the match was changed to a [[Professional wrestling match types#No Holds Barred match|no disqualification match]].<ref>https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/chris-jericho-vs-tetsuya-naito-njpw-wrestle-kingdom-13-now-no-dq-match-final-updated-card</ref>\n\nOn October 27, 2018 at the Road to Power Struggle, the tag teams of [[Taguchi Japan]] ([[Yujiro Kushida|Kushida]] and [[Chris Sabin]]) and [[Bullet Club]] ([[Taiji Ishimori]] and [[Robbie Eagles]]) faced off in a tournament match of the [[Super Junior Tag Tournament#2018|Super Junior Tag League]]. The Bullet Club team went on to win that match with Ishimori pinning the [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship|IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion]] Kushida, laying a possible challenge on the table. On November 3 at Power Struggle, Kushida was set to team with the [[Great Bash Heel]] to face Eagles and the [[Guerrillas of Destiny]] in a six-man tag team match. Ishimori in crutches was in the corner of his Bullet Club stablemates and ended up costing Kushida the match, hitting him with a crutch. After the match, he revealed that he had faked the injury and held up Kushida's title. On the following Monday, NJPW management announced a match between the two for the championship.\n\nOn January 5, 2018 at New Year Dash!!, newly returned Jay White was invited by Bullet Club's leader Kenny Omega to join his faction. White seemed to accept, but then turned on Omega and left the ring. On the following day, NJPW hosted a post-[[Wrestle Kingdom 12]] press conference to announce White as a new member of [[Chaos (professional wrestling)|Chaos]] instead. During the press conference, White expressed his ambitions towards the leader Kazuchika Okada's IWGP Heavyweight Championship title and said that he was not going to \"fall in the background\" like several other members of Chaos. In response, Okada said that White was not on his level yet and that if they were to wrestle in the future he would realize that. Throughout White's time in Chaos, he would pull for intra-faction matches, even picking fellow Chaos member Tomohiro Ishii to win the [[New Japan Cup#2018|New Japan Cup]] and urging him to challenge Okada if he were to win the tournament. He would also attack opponents before the start of his matches, much to the disapproval of his teammates. White was drawn in Okada's block at the annual G1 Climax tournament and on July 14 at the first night defeated him through nefarious means such as knocking down the referee, using a chair and hitting Okada with a low blow. Neither of them advanced to the final of the tournament, which was won by Hiroshi Tanahashi. On September 23 at Destruction in Kobe, Okada challenged Tanahashi for his Tokyo Dome IWGP Heavyweight Championship challenge rights certificate, but lost. After the match, White attacked both Tanahashi and Okada, with Okada's former longtime manager [[Gedo (wrestler)|Gedo]] turning on him and aligning himself with White. On October 8 at King of Pro-Wrestling, White unsuccessfully challenged Tanahashi for the certificate and assaulted him only for Okada to make the save. Okada turned his focus to Gedo and this brought Gedo's tag team partner [[Jado]].

As is an annual tradition since the [[G1 Climax#2012|2012 G1 Climax]], the winner of the tournament receives the [[G1 Climax#Tokyo Dome IWGP Heavyweight Championship challenge rights certificate|Tokyo Dome IWGP Heavyweight Championship challenge rights certificate]], which grants him a match at the next [[January 4 Tokyo Dome Show|Wrestle Kingdom]] event for the [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship]]. Tanahashi went on to defend the certificate against [[Kazuchika Okada]] on September 23 at [[Destruction (2018)|Destruction in Kobe]] and [[Jay White]] on October 8 at [[King of Pro-Wrestling (2018)|King of Pro-Wrestling]]. Similarly, the IWGP Heavyweight Champion [[Kenny Omega]] went on to defend his title against [[Tomohiro Ishii]] on September 15 at Destruction in Hiroshima and in a three-way match against [[Cody Rhodes|Cody]] and [[Kota Ibushi]] also on October 8 at King of Pro-Wrestling. The match was then officially announced, with Omega defending the title against Tanahashi.\n\nAfter the main event match at New Year Dash!! on January 5, 2018, [[Chris Jericho]] attacked [[Tetsuya Naito]]. Later in the year on April 29 at [[Wrestling Hinokuni#2018|Wrestling Hinokuni]], Naito won the [[IWGP Intercontinental Championship]] by defeating [[Minoru Suzuki]]. On May 4 at night 2 of [[Wrestling Dontaku 2018|Wrestling Dontaku]], Jericho returned to attack Naito again and set a match between the two at [[Dominion 6.9 in Osaka-jo Hall]] for Naito's championship. Jericho went on to defeat Naito and win the title. His first defense was at [[Power Struggle (2018)|Power Struggle]] on November 3 in which Jericho defeated Naito's ''[[Los Ingobernables de Japon]]'' stablemate [[Evil (wrestler)|Evil]]. After the end of the match, Naito went on to save Evil after Jericho's continued assault on him and proceeded to challenge Jericho for the championship. Despite Jericho's refusal, NJPW management went on to announce the match for Wrestle Kingdom 13. At Fan Fest on January 3, the match was changed to a [[Professional wrestling match types#No Holds Barred match|no disqualification match]].<ref>https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/chris-jericho-vs-tetsuya-naito-njpw-wrestle-kingdom-13-now-no-dq-match-final-updated-card</ref>\n\nOn October 27, 2018 at the Road to Power Struggle, the tag teams of [[Taguchi Japan]] ([[Yujiro Kushida|Kushida]] and [[Chris Sabin]]) and [[Bullet Club]] ([[Taiji Ishimori]] and [[Robbie Eagles]]) faced off in a tournament match of the [[Super Junior Tag Tournament#2018|Super Junior Tag League]]. The Bullet Club team went on to win that match with Ishimori pinning the [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship|IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion]] Kushida, laying a possible challenge on the table. On November 3 at Power Struggle, Kushida was set to team with the [[Great Bash Heel]] to face Eagles and the [[Guerrillas of Destiny]] in a six-man tag team match. Ishimori in crutches was in the corner of his Bullet Club stablemates and ended up costing Kushida the match, hitting him with a crutch. After the match, he revealed that he had faked the injury and held up Kushida's title. On the following Monday, NJPW management announced a match between the two for the championship.\n\nOn January 5, 2018 at New Year Dash!!, newly returned Jay White was invited by Bullet Club's leader Kenny Omega to join his faction. White seemed to accept, but then turned on Omega and left the ring. On the following day, NJPW hosted a post-[[Wrestle Kingdom 12]] press conference to announce White as a new member of [[Chaos (professional wrestling)|Chaos]] instead. During the press conference, White expressed his ambitions towards the leader Kazuchika Okada's IWGP Heavyweight Championship title and said that he was not going to \"fall in the background\" like several other members of Chaos. In response, Okada said that White was not on his level yet and that if they were to wrestle in the future he would realize that. Throughout White's time in Chaos, he would pull for intra-faction matches, even picking fellow Chaos member Tomohiro Ishii to win the [[New Japan Cup#2018|New Japan Cup]] and urging him to challenge Okada if he were to win the tournament. He would also attack opponents before the start of his matches, much to the disapproval of his teammates. White was drawn in Okada's block at the annual G1 Climax tournament and on July 14 at the first night defeated him through nefarious means such as knocking down the referee, using a chair and hitting Okada with a low blow. Neither of them advanced to the final of the tournament, which was won by Hiroshi Tanahashi. On September 23 at Destruction in Kobe, Okada challenged Tanahashi for his Tokyo Dome IWGP Heavyweight Championship challenge rights certificate, but lost. After the match, White attacked both Tanahashi and Okada, with Okada's former longtime manager [[Gedo (wrestler)|Gedo]] turning on him and aligning himself with White. On October 8 at King of Pro-Wrestling, White unsuccessfully challenged Tanahashi for the certificate and assaulted him only for Okada to make the save. Okada turned his focus to Gedo and this brought Gedo's tag team partner [[Jado]]. Initially, it seemed that Jado was trying to be the peacekeeper, but he eventually turned on Okada as Bullet Club's OG faction rushed to the ring and assaulted him. White, Gedo and Jado ended up joining Bullet Club. On November 3 at Power Struggle, Okada tagged with his stablemate [[Trent Barreta|Beretta]] to defeat the team of White and [[Bad Luck Fale]]. White proceeded to challenge Okada to a singles match, anytime and anywhere, which NJPW management officially announced for Wrestle Kingdom 13.\n\nOn November 3, 2018 at Power Struggle, the team of [[Roppongi 3K]] ([[Sho Tanaka|Sho]] and [[Yohei Komatsu|Yoh]]) defeated the [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship|IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champion]] team of [[Suzuki-gun]] ([[Yoshinobu Kanemaru]] and [[El Desperado (wrestler)|El Desperado]]) and the team of ''Los Ingobernables de Japon'' ([[Tetsuya Bushi|Bushi]] and [[Shingo Takagi]]) in a three-way tag team match to win the Super Junior Tag League. On the following Monday, the same match was scheduled for this event\u2014this time for Suzuki-gun's championship.\n\nOn October 14, 2018 at [[Global Wars UK#2018|Global Wars UK]], Tomohiro Ishii defeated Minoru Suzuki to win the [[RPW British Heavyweight Championship|British Heavyweight Championship]]. At Power Struggle, Ishii defeated Suzuki to retain the title. On November 9 at [[Revolution Pro Wrestling]]'s Uprising event, Tomohiro Ishii successfully defended the championship against [[David Starr (wrestler)|David Starr]]. Following the match, Ishii was attacked by [[Zack Sabre Jr.]] and Suzuki-gun, with Sabre challenging Ishii for a championship match at Wrestle Kingdom 13.\n\nOn July 7, 2018 at [[G1 Special in San Francisco]], [[Juice Robinson]] defeated Jay White to win the [[IWGP United States Championship]]. During his first defense at [[Fighting Spirit Unleashed]], Robinson was defeated by Cody. A rematch was later scheduled for Wrestle Kingdom.\n\nOn December 9, 2018, ''Los Ingobernables de Japon'' ([[Seiya Sanada|Sanada]] and [[Evil (wrestler)|Evil]]) defeated Bullet Club's [[Tama Tonga]] and [[Tanga Loa]] to win the [[World Tag League (NJPW)#2018|World Tag League]]. Following the match, Sanada and Evil challenged for an IWGP Tag Team Championship match at Wrestle Kingdom before being interrupted by The Young Bucks. A three-way match was later announced for Wrestle Kingdom.\n\n[[Will Ospreay]] was originally supposed to face [[Taichi Ishikari|Taichi]] for the [[NEVER Openweight Championship]] at Power Struggle, however, the match was later cancelled due to an injury suffered by Ospreay. On the final day of World Tag League, Ospreay defeated Taichi to become the number-one contender to the NEVER Openweight Championship.

OEE can be illustrated by a brief discussion of the six metrics that comprise the system (the \"Six Big Losses\").   \n\n== Calculations for OEE and TEEP ==\nThe OEE of a manufacturing unit are calculated as the product of three separate components:\n\n*''' [[Availability]]:''' percentage of scheduled time that the operation is available to operate. Often referred to as Uptime.\n*''' Performance:''' speed at which the Work Center runs as a percentage of its designed speed.\n*''' [[Quality (business)|Quality]]:''' Good Units produced as a percentage of the Total Units Started.

OEE may be applied to any individual Work Center, or rolled up to Department or Plant levels. This tool also allows for drilling down for very specific analysis, such as a particular Part Number, Shift, or any of several other parameters.\nIt is unlikely that any manufacturing process can run at 100% OEE. Many manufacturers benchmark their industry to set a challenging target; 85% is not uncommon.\n\n*OEE is calculated with the formula (Availability)*(Performance)*(Quality)\n\n*Using the examples given below:\n*(Availability= 86.6%)*(Performance=93%)*(Quality=91.3%)= (OEE=73.6%)\nAlternatively, and often easier, OEE is calculated by dividing the minimum time needed to produce the parts under optimal conditions by the actual time needed to produce the parts. For example:\n*Total Time: 8 hour shift or 28,800 seconds, producing 14,400 parts, or one part every 2 seconds.\n*Fastest possible cycle time is 1.5 seconds, hence only 21,600 seconds would have been needed to produce the 14,400 parts. The remaining 7,200 seconds or 2 hours were lost.\n*The OEE is now the 21,600 seconds divided by 28,800 seconds (same as minimal 1.5 seconds per part divided by 2 actual seconds per part), or 75%.\n\n=== Total effective equipment performance ===\nWhereas OEE measures effectiveness based on scheduled hours, TEEP measures effectiveness against calendar hours, i.e.: 24 hours per day, 365 days per year.\n\nTEEP, therefore, reports the 'bottom line' utilization of assets.\n\nTEEP = Loading * OEE<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Loading===\nThe Loading portion of the TEEP Metric represents the percentage of time that an operation is scheduled to operate compared to the total Calendar Time that is available.

In practice it is often difficult to determine speed losses, and a common approach is to merely assign the remaining unknown losses as speed losses.\n\n'''Calculation: Performance ([[Productivity]]) = (Parts Produced * Ideal Cycle Time) / Operating time''' <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.oee.com/calculating-oee.html | title = OEE Primer: Calculating OEE |accessdate = 9 Jul 2013}}</ref>\n\n''Example:''\n\nA given Work Center is scheduled to run for an 8-hour (480 minute) shift with a 30-minute scheduled break.\n\nOperating Time = 450 Min Scheduled \u2013 60 Min Unscheduled Downtime = 390 Minutes\n\nThe Standard Rate for the part being produced is 40 Units/Hour or 1.5 Minutes/Unit\n\nThe Work Center produces 242 Total Units during the shift. Note: The basis is Total Units, not Good Units. The Performance metric does not penalize for Quality.\n\nTime to Produce Parts = 242 Units * 1.5 Minutes/Unit  = 363 Minutes\n\nPerformance (Productivity)  = 363 Minutes / 390 Minutes = 93.1%\n\n===Quality===\nThe Quality portion of the OEE Metric represents the Good Units produced as a percentage of the Total Units Started.

The losses due to defects and rework are called ''quality losses'' and ''quality stops''.\nReworked units which have been corrected are only measured as ''unscheduled downtime'' while units being scrapped can affect both operation time and unit count. \n\n\n'''Calculation: Quality = (Units produced - defective units) / (Units produced)'''<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.sensrtrx.com/calculate-oee/|title=Calculate OEE - Simple Calculator & OEE Formulas|newspaper=SensrTrx {{!}} Cloud Manufacturing Analytics|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-15}}</ref>\n\n''Example:''\n\n242 Units are produced. 21 are defective.\n\n(242 units produced - 21 defective units) = 221 units\n\n221 good units / 242 total units produced = 91.32%\n\n== \"Six Big Losses\" ==\n[[File:OEE SixLoss Calculation Example.png|thumb|Example of OEE and Six Loss calculation]]\nTo be able to better determine the sources of the greatest loss and to target the areas that should be improved to increase performances, these categories ([https://evocon.com/kb/what-is-oee-and-how-does-it-work/ Availability, Performance and Quality]) have been subdivided further into what is known as the \u2018Six Big Losses\u2019 to OEE.\n\nThese are categorized as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Availability!! Performance!! Quality\n|-\n| Planned Downtime || Minor Stops || Production Rejects\n|-\n| Breakdowns || Speed Loss || Rejects on Start up\n|-\n|}\n\nThe reason for identifying the losses in these categories is so that specific countermeasures can be applied to reduce the loss and improve the overall OEE.\n\n== Total Productive Maintenance ==\nContinuous improvement in OEE is the goal of TPM ([[Total productive maintenance|Total Productive Maintenance]]). Specifically, the goal of TPM as set out by Seiichi Nakajima is \"The continuous improvement of OEE by engaging all those that impact on it in small group activities\". To achieve this, the TPM toolbox sets out a Focused improvement tactic to reduce each of the six types of OEE loss. For example the [[Focused improvement]] tactic to systematically reduce breakdown risk sets out how to improve asset condition and standardise working methods to reduce human error and accelerated wear.\n\nCombining OEE with Focused improvement converts OEE from a lagging to a leading indicator. The first Focused improvement stage of OEE improvement is to achieve a stable OEE. One which varies at around 5% from the mean for a representative production sample. Once an asset effectiveness is stable and not impacted by variability in equipment wear rates and working methods. The second stage of OEE improvement (optimisation) can be carried out to remove chronic losses. Combining OEE and TPM Focused improvement tactics creates a leading indicator that can be used to guide performance management priorities. As the TPM process delivers these gains through small cross functional improvement teams, the process of OEE improvement raises front line team engagement/problem ownership, collaboration and skill levels. It is this combination of OEE as a KPI, TPM Focused improvement tactics and front line team engagement that locks in the gains and delivers the TPM goal of year on year improvement in OEE. \n\n== Heuristic ==\nOEE is useful as a [[heuristic]], but can break down in several circumstances.  For example, it may be far more costly to\nrun a facility at certain times.  Performance and quality may not be independent of each other or of availability and loading.\nExperience may develop over time. Since the performance of shop floor managers is at least sometimes compared to the OEE, these numbers are often not reliable, and there are numerous ways to fudge these numbers.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.allaboutlean.com/fudge-oee | title = Top Three Methods on how to Fudge Your OEE|accessdate = 5 Jan 2014}}</ref>\n\nOEE has properties of a [[geometric mean]].  As such it punishes [[Statistical variability|variability]] among its subcomponents.  For example, 20% * 80% = 16%,\nwhereas 50% * 50% = 25%.  When there are asymmetric costs associated with one or more of the components, then the model may become less appropriate.\n\nConsider a system where the cost of error is exceptionally high. In such a condition, higher quality may be far more important\nin a proper evaluation of [[effectiveness]] than performance or availability. OEE also to some extent assumes a closed system and a potentially static one. If one can bring in additional resources (or lease out unused resources to other projects or business units) then it may be more appropriate for example to use an expected [[net present value]] analysis.\n\nVariability in flow can also introduce important costs and [[risk]]s that may merit further modeling. [[Sensitivity analysis]] and measures of change may be helpful.\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* {{cite book | last = Hansen | first = Robert C | year = 2005 | title = Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) | publisher = Industrial Press | ISBN = 978-0-8311-3237-8}}\n* {{cite book | last = Koch | first = Arno |year = 2007 | title = OEE for the Production Team | publisher = Makigami| isbn = 978-90-78210-08-5 | id = (English). {{ISBN|978-90-78210-07-8}}  (Dutch)., {{ISBN|978-3-940775-04-7}} (German)}}\n* {{citation  |author = Productivity Press Development Team | year = 1999 | title = OEE for Operators: Overall Equipment Effectiveness | publisher = Productivity Press |  ISBN =978-1-56327-221-9}}\n*[http://mescenter.org/en/articles/125-oee-and-derived-indicators-teep-pee-oae-ope-ofe-ote-and-cte OEE and derived indicators TEEP, PEE, OAE, OPE, OFE, OTE and CTE], MES Center Association\n\n==See also==\n* [[Total productive maintenance]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n<!-- ==============================({{NoMoreLinks}})============================== -->\n<!-- DO NOT ADD MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

In practice it is often difficult to determine speed losses, and a common approach is to merely assign the remaining unknown losses as speed losses.\n\n'''Calculation: Performance ([[Productivity]]) = (Parts Produced * Ideal Cycle Time) / Operating time''' <ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.oee.com/calculating-oee.html | title = OEE Primer: Calculating OEE |accessdate = 9 Jul 2013}}</ref>\n\n''Example:''\n\nA given Work Center is scheduled to run for an 8-hour (480 minute) shift with a 30-minute scheduled break.\n\nOperating Time = 450 Min Scheduled \u2013 60 Min Unscheduled Downtime = 390 Minutes\n\nThe Standard Rate for the part being produced is 40 Units/Hour or 1.5 Minutes/Unit\n\nThe Work Center produces 242 Total Units during the shift.

Availability!! Performance!! Quality\n|-\n| Planned Downtime || Minor Stops || Production Rejects\n|-\n| Breakdowns || Speed Loss || Rejects on Start up\n|-\n|}\n\nThe reason for identifying the losses in these categories is so that specific countermeasures can be applied to reduce the loss and improve the overall OEE.\n\n== Total Productive Maintenance ==\nContinuous improvement in OEE is the goal of TPM ([[Total productive maintenance|Total Productive Maintenance]]). Specifically, the goal of TPM as set out by Seiichi Nakajima is \"The continuous improvement of OEE by engaging all those that impact on it in small group activities\". To achieve this, the TPM toolbox sets out a Focused improvement tactic to reduce each of the six types of OEE loss. For example the [[Focused improvement]] tactic to systematically reduce breakdown risk sets out how to improve asset condition and standardise working methods to reduce human error and accelerated wear.\n\nCombining OEE with Focused improvement converts OEE from a lagging to a leading indicator. The first Focused improvement stage of OEE improvement is to achieve a stable OEE. One which varies at around 5% from the mean for a representative production sample. Once an asset effectiveness is stable and not impacted by variability in equipment wear rates and working methods. The second stage of OEE improvement (optimisation) can be carried out to remove chronic losses. Combining OEE and TPM Focused improvement tactics creates a leading indicator that can be used to guide performance management priorities. As the TPM process delivers these gains through small cross functional improvement teams, the process of OEE improvement raises front line team engagement/problem ownership, collaboration and skill levels. It is this combination of OEE as a KPI, TPM Focused improvement tactics and front line team engagement that locks in the gains and delivers the TPM goal of year on year improvement in OEE. \n\n== Heuristic ==\nOEE is useful as a [[heuristic]], but can break down in several circumstances.  For example, it may be far more costly to\nrun a facility at certain times.  Performance and quality may not be independent of each other or of availability and loading.\nExperience may develop over time. Since the performance of shop floor managers is at least sometimes compared to the OEE, these numbers are often not reliable, and there are numerous ways to fudge these numbers.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.allaboutlean.com/fudge-oee | title = Top Three Methods on how to Fudge Your OEE|accessdate = 5 Jan 2014}}</ref>\n\nOEE has properties of a [[geometric mean]].  As such it punishes [[Statistical variability|variability]] among its subcomponents.  For example, 20% * 80% = 16%,\nwhereas 50% * 50% = 25%.  When there are asymmetric costs associated with one or more of the components, then the model may become less appropriate.\n\nConsider a system where the cost of error is exceptionally high. In such a condition, higher quality may be far more important\nin a proper evaluation of [[effectiveness]] than performance or availability. OEE also to some extent assumes a closed system and a potentially static one. If one can bring in additional resources (or lease out unused resources to other projects or business units) then it may be more appropriate for example to use an expected [[net present value]] analysis.\n\nVariability in flow can also introduce important costs and [[risk]]s that may merit further modeling. [[Sensitivity analysis]] and measures of change may be helpful.\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* {{cite book | last = Hansen | first = Robert C | year = 2005 | title = Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) | publisher = Industrial Press | ISBN = 978-0-8311-3237-8}}\n* {{cite book | last = Koch | first = Arno |year = 2007 | title = OEE for the Production Team | publisher = Makigami| isbn = 978-90-78210-08-5 | id = (English). {{ISBN|978-90-78210-07-8}}  (Dutch)., {{ISBN|978-3-940775-04-7}} (German)}}\n* {{citation  |author = Productivity Press Development Team | year = 1999 | title = OEE for Operators: Overall Equipment Effectiveness | publisher = Productivity Press |  ISBN =978-1-56327-221-9}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Total productive maintenance]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n<!-- ==============================({{NoMoreLinks}})============================== -->\n<!-- DO NOT ADD MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

There is a disputed claim that the castle is the ''bona fide'' location of the entire legend, and the alleged Okiku's Well remains in the castle to this day.<ref name=\"ball2005\" /> According to the legend, Okiku was falsely accused of losing dishes that were valuable family treasures, and then killed and thrown into the well.<ref name=\"guidebook\" /> Her ghost remained to haunt the well at night, counting dishes in a despondent tone.<ref name=\"guidebook\" />\n\nThe legend of the {{nihongo|\"Old Widow's Stone\"|\u59e5\u304c\u77f3|Ubagaishi}} is another folklore story associated with the castle.<ref name=\"guidebook\" /> According to the legend, [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] ran out of stones when building the original three-story keep, and an old woman heard about his trouble.<ref name=\"guidebook\" /> She gave him her hand millstone even though she needed it for her trade.<ref name=\"guidebook\" /> It was said that people who heard the story were inspired and also offered stones to Hideyoshi, speeding up construction of the castle.<ref name=\"guidebook\" /> To this day, the supposed stone can be seen covered with a wire net in the middle of one of the stone walls in the castle complex.<ref name=\"guidebook\" />\n\nA folklore story is also associated with Sakurai Genbei, who was [[Ikeda Terumasa]]'s master carpenter in the construction of the keep.<ref name=\"guidebook\" /> According to the legend, Sakurai was dissatisfied with his construction, feeling that the keep leaned a little to the southeast.<ref name=\"guidebook\" /> Eventually, he became distraught and climbed to the top of the keep, where he jumped to his death with a chisel in his mouth.<ref name=\"guidebook\" />\n\n== Visitor statistics ==\n* On 14 April 2009, the total number of visits since the Showa-era restoration surpassed 40 million.<ref>[http://www.47news.jp/CN/200904/CN2009041401000201.html \u59eb\u8def\u57ce\u3001\u5165\u5834\u8005\uff14\uff10\uff10\uff10\u4e07\u4eba\u7a81\u7834\u3000\u662d\u548c\u306e\u5927\u4fee\u7406\u304b\u3089\uff14\uff15\u5e74\u3067] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712141534/http://www.47news.jp/CN/200904/CN2009041401000201.html |date=July 12, 2014 }}\uff08\u5171\u540c\u901a\u4fe12009\u5e744\u670814\u65e5\uff09</ref>\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* 1964 \u2013 1,738,000 (Showa-era restoration work completed)\n* 1989 \u2013 1,197,000\n* 1990 \u2013 811,000\n* 1991 \u2013 871,000\n* 1992 \u2013 885,000\n* 1993 \u2013 1,019,000\n* 1994 \u2013 983,000\n* 1995 \u2013 695,000\n* 1996 \u2013 861,000\n* 1997 \u2013 716,000\n* 1998 \u2013 792,000\n* 1999 \u2013 713,000\n* 2000 \u2013 662,000\n* 2001 \u2013 708,000\n* 2002 \u2013 729,000\n* 2003 \u2013 814,000\n* 2004 \u2013 771,000\n* 2005 \u2013 778,000\n* 2006 \u2013 899,000\n* 2007 \u2013 1,023,000\n* 2008 \u2013 1,195,000\n* 2009 \u2013 1,561,000\n* 2010 \u2013 458,000 (restoration work started)\n* 2011 \u2013 611,000\n* 2012 \u2013 711,000\n* 2013 \u2013 881,000<ref name=stats>{{cite web|url=http://www.city.himeji.lg.jp/var/rev0/0072/9570/201561913227.pdf|title=\u5e73\u621026\u5e74\u5ea6\u59eb\u8def\u5e02\u5165\u8fbc\u5ba2\u6570\u3001\u89b3\u5149\u52d5\u5411\u30fb\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u30a2\u30f3\u30b1\u30fc\u30c8\u8abf\u67fb\u5831\u544a\u66f8 P3|accessdate=May 18, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616170524/http://www.city.himeji.lg.jp/var/rev0/0072/9570/201561913227.pdf|archivedate=June 16, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n* 2014 \u2013 919,000<ref name=\"stats\" />\n* 2015 \u2013 2,860,000 (restoration work completed in March)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mainichi.jp/articles/20160405/k00/00e/040/215000c|author=Yoshiko Yukinaga |title=\u300c\u59eb\u8def\u57ce\u6765\u5834\u8005\u3001\u65e5\u672c\u4e00\u306b\u3002\u904e\u53bb\u6700\u591a\uff12\uff18\uff16\u4e07\u4eba\u300d |publisher=Mainichi Shinbun |access-date=13 May 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Additional information ==\n\n=== National treasures and sister castles ===\nOther national treasures (castles) besides Himeji Castle include Matsumoto Castle, Inuyama Castle, Matsue Castle, and Hikone Castle.

The main [[Tenshu|donjon]] (\u5929\u5b88\u95a3 tenshukaku) was constructed by the Ishikawa family from 1593 to 1594 when the family was put in charge of the castle.
