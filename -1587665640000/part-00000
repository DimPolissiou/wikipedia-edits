For example, a 308 destined for the American market would sport much larger heavier bumpers and a slightly sturdier frame (and many other smaller details) in order to meet more stringent US road [[National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act|safety standards]]. American market cars also suffered a performance hit due to a compression ratio of 8.6:1 vs 9.2:1 for most of the rest of the world [[Automobile emissions control|state emissions legislation]] which reduced horsepower. As a result of these differences there is often a premium paid for the \"purer\" European spec car over the federalized car.[[File:308 euro us.jpg|200px|right|thumb|A 1979 Euro spec GTS (left) and a 1977 US spec GTB (right)]]\n\nSome differences between the Euro-spec and US-spec cars are shown below:\n* 240&nbsp;hp vs. 233&nbsp;hp\n* Different gear ratios\n* Lighter, small front bumper that follows the hood line vs. 2.5&nbsp;mph impact bumper that is extended and has extra \"fangs\"\n* Lighter, small rear bumper vs. impact bumper with spacer\n* Exposed dual tip muffler vs. black muffler cover with [[catalytic converter]]\n* Vitaloni style outside mirrors vs. larger flag mirrors that provide a better view for safety\n* Small yellow front side marker light with no rear side lights vs. large rectangular yellow front and red rear side marker lights (many euro cars now in the USA had the euro lights converted to USA spec and added the red rear lights)\n* No \"fasten seat belt\" warning light in Euro spec\n* Flash to pass driving lights in front grill in Euro spec\n* Space saver spare tyre vs. full size spare\n* Rear engine cover top has only a left and right grill vs. \"U\" shaped grill that provides a larger cooling area necessary for the added catalytic converter just behind the muffler.\n* Overall weight of Euro spec lower because of door beams and bumpers.\n\n== 308 GTB Millechiodi ==\nThe 308 GTB Millechiodi was an aerodynamic study based on the 308 GTB and designed by [[Pininfarina]].

For example, a 308 destined for the American market would sport much larger heavier bumpers and a slightly sturdier frame (and many other smaller details) in order to meet more stringent US road [[National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act|safety standards]]. American market cars also suffered a performance hit due to a compression ratio of 8.6:1 vs 9.2:1 for most of the rest of the world [[Automobile emissions control|state emissions legislation]] which reduced horsepower. As a result of these differences there is often a premium paid for the \"purer\" European spec car over the federalized car.[[File:308 euro us.jpg|200px|right|thumb|A 1979 Euro spec GTS (left) and a 1977 US spec GTB (right)]]\n\nSome differences between the Euro-spec and US-spec cars are shown below:\n* 240&nbsp;hp vs. 233&nbsp;hp\n* Different gear ratios\n* Lighter, small front bumper that follows the hood line vs. 2.5&nbsp;mph impact bumper that is extended and has extra \"fangs\"\n* Lighter, small rear bumper vs. impact bumper with spacer\n* Exposed dual tip muffler vs. black muffler cover with [[catalytic converter]]\n* Vitaloni style outside mirrors vs. larger flag mirrors that provide a better view for safety\n* Small yellow front side marker light with no rear side lights vs. large rectangular yellow front and red rear side marker lights (many euro cars now in the USA had the euro lights converted to USA spec and added the red rear lights)\n* No \"fasten seat belt\" warning light in Euro spec\n* Flash to pass driving lights in front grill in Euro spec\n* Space saver spare tyre vs. full size spare\n* Rear engine cover top has only a left and right grill vs. \"U\" shaped grill that provides a larger cooling area necessary for the added catalytic converter just behind the muffler.\n* Overall weight of Euro spec lower because of door beams and bumpers.\n\n== 308 GTB Millechiodi ==\nThe 308 GTB Millechiodi was an aerodynamic study based on the 308 GTB and designed by [[Pininfarina]].

In September 2013, Amazon further updated the Fire tablet with the [[Kindle Fire HDX]]. In November 2013, Apple released the [[iPad Mini 2]], which remained at 7.9 inches and nearly matched the hardware of the [[iPad Air]].\n\n===Phablet===\n{{Main|Phablet}}\n[[Smartphone]]s and tablets are similar devices, differentiated by the former typically having smaller screens and most tablets lacking [[cellular network]] capability. Since 2010, crossover touchscreen [[smartphone]]s with screens larger than 5 inches have been released. That size is generally considered larger than a traditional [[smartphone]], creating the hybrid category of the ''[[phablet]]'' by [[Forbes]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerkay/2012/02/07/is-the-market-ready-for-a-phablet/ |title=5\" Is the market ready for a 'phablet'? |work=Forbes |first=Roger |last=Kay |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729211214/https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerkay/2012/02/07/is-the-market-ready-for-a-phablet/ |archive-date=July 29, 2017}}</ref> and other publications. \"Phablet\" is a [[portmanteau]] of \"phone\" and \"tablet\".\n\nAt the time of the introduction of the first phablets, they had screens of 5.3 to 5.5 inches, but as of 2017 screen sizes up to 5.5 inches are considered typical. Examples of phablets from 2017 and onward are the [[Samsung Galaxy Note series]] (newer models of 5.7 inches), the [[LG V10]]/[[LG V20|V20]] (5.7 inches), the [[Sony Xperia XA Ultra]] [6 inches], the [[Huawei Mate 9]] (5.9 inches), and  the Huawei Honor (MediaPad) X2 (7 inches).\n\n===2-in-1===\n{{anchor|Convertible}}\n{{anchor|Hybrid}}\n{{Main|2-in-1 PC}}\n\nA 2-in-1 PC is a hybrid or combination of a tablet and [[laptop]] computer that has features of both. Distinct from tablets, '''[[2-in-1 PC]]s''' all have physical [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboards]], but they are either concealable by folding them back and under the touchscreen (\"2-in-1 convertible\") or detachable (\"2-in-1 detachable\"). 2-in-1s typically also can display a virtual keyboard on their touchscreens when their physical keyboards are concealed or detached. Some 2-in-1s have processors and [[operating system]]s like those of laptops, such as [[Windows 10]], while having the flexibility of operation as a tablet. Further, 2-in-1s may have typical laptop [[I/O]] ports, such as [[USB 3]] and [[DisplayPort]], and may connect to traditional [[Personal computer|PC]] [[peripheral devices]] and external displays. Simple tablets are mainly used as [[media consumption]] devices, while 2-in-1s have capacity for both [[media consumption]] and [[content creation]], and thus 2-in-1s are often called ''laptop'' or ''[[desktop replacement computer]]s''.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Here Come the Hybrid 'Laplets.'

Examples include 2-in-1 PCs of the [[Lenovo Yoga]] series.\n* '''Detachables''' or '''Hybrids''' have physical keyboards that may be detached from their [[Chassis#Electronics|chassis]], even while the 2-in-1 is operating. Examples include 2-in-1 PCs of the [[Asus Transformer]] Pad and Book series, the [[iPad Pro]], and the Microsoft [[Surface Book]] and [[Microsoft Surface|Surface Pro]].\n\n===Gaming tablet===\n{{anchor|Gaming}}\nSome tablets are modified by adding physical [[gamepad]] buttons such as [[D-pad]] and thumb sticks for better gaming experience combined with the [[touchscreen]] and all other features of a typical tablet computer. Most of these tablets are targeted to run native OS games and [[emulator]] games. [[Nvidia]]'s [[Shield Tablet]], with an {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}} display, and running [[Android (operating system)|Android]], is an example. It runs Android games purchased from [[Google Play]] store. [[PC game]]s can also be [[streaming media|streamed]] to the tablet from computers with some higher end models of Nvidia-powered [[video card]]s. The [[Nintendo Switch]] hybrid console is also a gaming tablet that runs on [[Nintendo Switch system software]], features detachable [[Joy-Con]] controllers with motion controls and three gaming modes: table-top mode using its kickstand, traditional docked/TV mode and handheld mode.\n\n===Booklet===\nBooklets are [[dual-touchscreen]] tablet computers with a [[Flip (form)|clamshell]] design that can fold like a laptop.

For example, in hardware, a transportation company may find that the consumer-grade [[GPS]] module in an [[Commercial off-the-shelf|off-the-shelf]] tablet provides insufficient accuracy, so a tablet can be customized and embedded with a professional-grade antenna to provide a better GPS signal. Such tablets may also be [[Rugged computer|ruggedized]] for field use. For a software example, the same transportation company might remove certain software functions in the Android system, such as the internet browser, to reduce costs from needless cellular network data consumption of an employee, and add custom package management software. Other applications may call for a [[resistive touchscreen]] and other special hardware and software.\n\n[[File:Ziosk games.jpg|thumb|Games on a Ziosk table ordering tablet at an Olive Garden restaurant]]\nA table ordering tablet is a touchscreen tablet computer designed for use in [[Types of restaurant#Casual dining|casual restaurants]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Tabletop tablets speed up restaurant service|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/tabletop-tablets-speed-up-restaurant-service/|publisher=[[CBS News]]|access-date=December 16, 2016|date=September 22, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510204310/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/tabletop-tablets-speed-up-restaurant-service/|archive-date=May 10, 2016}}</ref> Such devices allow users to order food and drinks, play games and pay their bill.

The chip was adopted by Psion, Palm and Nokia for PDAs and later smartphones, camera phones, cameras, etc. ARM's licensing model supported this success by allowing device manufacturers to license, alter and fabricate custom SoC derivatives tailored to their own products. This has helped manufacturers extend battery life and shrink component count along with the size of devices.\n\nThe multiple licensees ensured that multiple fabricators could supply near-identical products, while encouraging price competition.

That size is generally considered larger than a traditional [[smartphone]], creating the hybrid category of the ''[[phablet]]'' by [[Forbes]]<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerkay/2012/02/07/is-the-market-ready-for-a-phablet/ |title=5\" Is the market ready for a 'phablet'? |work=Forbes |first=Roger |last=Kay |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729211214/https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerkay/2012/02/07/is-the-market-ready-for-a-phablet/ |archive-date=July 29, 2017}}</ref> and other publications. \"Phablet\" is a [[portmanteau]] of \"phone\" and \"tablet\".\n\nAt the time of the introduction of the first phablets, they had screens of 5.3 to 5.5 inches, but as of 2017 screen sizes up to 5.5 inches are considered typical. Examples of phablets from 2017 and onward are the [[Samsung Galaxy Note series]] (newer models of 5.7 inches), the [[LG V10]]/[[LG V20|V20]] (5.7 inches), the [[Sony Xperia XA Ultra]] [6 inches], the [[Huawei Mate 9]] (5.9 inches), and  the Huawei Honor (MediaPad) X2 (7 inches).\n\n===2-in-1===\n{{anchor|Convertible}}\n{{anchor|Hybrid}}\n{{Main|2-in-1 PC}}\n\nA 2-in-1 PC is a hybrid or combination of a tablet and [[laptop]] computer that has features of both. Distinct from tablets, '''[[2-in-1 PC]]s''' all have physical [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboards]], but they are either concealable by folding them back and under the touchscreen (\"2-in-1 convertible\") or detachable (\"2-in-1 detachable\"). 2-in-1s typically also can display a virtual keyboard on their touchscreens when their physical keyboards are concealed or detached. Some 2-in-1s have processors and [[operating system]]s like those of laptops, such as [[Windows 10]], while having the flexibility of operation as a tablet. Further, 2-in-1s may have typical laptop [[I/O]] ports, such as [[USB 3]] and [[DisplayPort]], and may connect to traditional [[Personal computer|PC]] [[peripheral devices]] and external displays. Simple tablets are mainly used as [[media consumption]] devices, while 2-in-1s have capacity for both [[media consumption]] and [[content creation]], and thus 2-in-1s are often called ''laptop'' or ''[[desktop replacement computer]]s''.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Here Come the Hybrid 'Laplets.'

Examples include 2-in-1 PCs of the [[Lenovo Yoga]] series.\n* '''Detachables''' or '''Hybrids''' have physical keyboards that may be detached from their [[Chassis#Electronics|chassis]], even while the 2-in-1 is operating. Examples include 2-in-1 PCs of the [[Asus Transformer]] Pad and Book series, the [[iPad Pro]], and the Microsoft [[Surface Book]] and [[Microsoft Surface|Surface Pro]].\n\n===Gaming tablet===\n{{anchor|Gaming}}\nSome tablets are modified by adding physical [[gamepad]] buttons such as [[D-pad]] and thumb sticks for better gaming experience combined with the [[touchscreen]] and all other features of a typical tablet computer. Most of these tablets are targeted to run native OS games and [[emulator]] games. [[Nvidia]]'s [[Shield Tablet]], with an {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on}} display, and running [[Android (operating system)|Android]], is an example. It runs Android games purchased from [[Google Play]] store. [[PC game]]s can also be [[streaming media|streamed]] to the tablet from computers with some higher end models of Nvidia-powered [[video card]]s. The [[Nintendo Switch]] hybrid console is also a gaming tablet that runs on [[Nintendo Switch system software]], features detachable [[Joy-Con]] controllers with motion controls and three gaming modes: table-top mode using its kickstand, traditional docked/TV mode and handheld mode.\n\n===Booklet===\nBooklets are [[dual-touchscreen]] tablet computers with a [[Flip (form)|clamshell]] design that can fold like a laptop.

For example, in hardware, a transportation company may find that the consumer-grade [[GPS]] module in an [[Commercial off-the-shelf|off-the-shelf]] tablet provides insufficient accuracy, so a tablet can be customized and embedded with a professional-grade antenna to provide a better GPS signal. Such tablets may also be [[Rugged computer|ruggedized]] for field use. For a software example, the same transportation company might remove certain software functions in the Android system, such as the internet browser, to reduce costs from needless cellular network data consumption of an employee, and add custom package management software. Other applications may call for a [[resistive touchscreen]] and other special hardware and software.\n\n[[File:Ziosk games.jpg|thumb|Games on a Ziosk table ordering tablet at an Olive Garden restaurant]]\nA table ordering tablet is a touchscreen tablet computer designed for use in [[Types of restaurant#Casual dining|casual restaurants]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Tabletop tablets speed up restaurant service|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/tabletop-tablets-speed-up-restaurant-service/|publisher=[[CBS News]]|access-date=December 16, 2016|date=September 22, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510204310/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/tabletop-tablets-speed-up-restaurant-service/|archive-date=May 10, 2016}}</ref> Such devices allow users to order food and drinks, play games and pay their bill.

The chip was adopted by Psion, Palm and Nokia for PDAs and later smartphones, camera phones, cameras, etc. ARM's licensing model supported this success by allowing device manufacturers to license, alter and fabricate custom SoC derivatives tailored to their own products. This has helped manufacturers extend battery life and shrink component count along with the size of devices.\n\nThe multiple licensees ensured that multiple fabricators could supply near-identical products, while encouraging price competition. This forced unit prices down to a fraction of their x86 equivalents. The architecture has historically had limited support from Microsoft, with only [[Windows CE]] available, but with the 2012 release of Windows 8, Microsoft announced added support for the architecture, shipping their own ARM-based tablet computer, branded the [[Microsoft Surface]], as well as an x86-64 Intel Core i5 variant branded as Microsoft Surface Pro.<ref>{{cite web |title=Apple iPad Price, Features Say \"ARM\" All Over |url=https://www.bnet.com/blog/mobile-internet/apple-ipad-price-features-say-8220arm-8221-all-over/133 |publisher=bnet |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823032856/https://www.bnet.com/blog/mobile-internet/apple-ipad-price-features-say-8220arm-8221-all-over/133 |archive-date=August 23, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/node/21542402 |title=ARM vs. Intel: How the Processor Wars Will Benefit Consumers |author=Tim Barjarin |date=July 16, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912022324/https://www.economist.com/node/21542402 |archive-date=September 12, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/node/21542402 |title=The Economist - Space invaders, America's Intel and Britain's ARM have long dominated different bits of the global chip market.

Wicklow, the property of his grandfather, the Rev. Henry Braddell, M.A., Rector of Carnew, Co. Wicklow.<ref>One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 423</ref>\n\n===Sugar planter===\nAt the age of nearly seventeen he went to [[Demerara]] with his brother, George William, to learn sugar planting. The brother died there in 1840, and in 1844 Thomas Braddell arrived at [[Penang]] from Demerara to manage the sugar estate called Otaheite, in the [[Air Itam|Ayer Hitam]] Valley, which belonged to Messrs. Brown and Co. About this time a great impetus had been given to the sugar industry in the Straits by the new sugar duties, with the result that Brown and Co. opened in 1846 the [[Batu Kawan]] Estate, in [[Province Wellesley]], of which Mr. Braddell became the manager and owner of one quarter ; but the estate got inundated in a very high tide, the crop was lost, and the venture ended.<ref>One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 423\u2013424</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Public service in Penang===\nOn 1 January 1849 Mr. Braddell joined the service of the [[East India Company]] as Deputy Superintendent of Police at Penang. After holding various offices in Penang, the Province, and [[Malacca]], he was promoted to the highest position which any uncovenanted servant of the Company had ever held, that of Assistant Resident Councillor, Penang, a post which had previously been held by a covenanted civilian or high military officer. He earned this promotion for an act which made him famous at the time, and gained him the quickest promotion in Government service then known. In 1854 the most serious clan riots ever known broke out in Singapore, and the feud spread to Malacca, where the Chinese broke out, took possession of the country parts, and built a stockade in one of the main roads, where they defied the police. Mr. Braddell, who was at that time stationed in Malacca, without the slightest assistance and without calling on the military, went out with all the police he could get together, attacked the Chinese, killed and wounded several of them, took the stockade, and summarily ended the riots, for which act he was publicly thanked by the Governor.<ref name=ReferenceA>One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 424</ref>\n\n===Barrister of Gray's Inn===\nHe was not satisfied with his prospects in the Company as an uncovenanted servant, and commenced to study for the Bar, a natural bent, seeing that from 1801 relatives of his had been at the [[Irish Bar]]. On 10 June 1859 he was called at [[Gray's Inn]] ; in 1862 he resigned the Company's service and went to Singapore, where he commenced practice in partnership with Mr. [[Abraham Logan]], as Logan and Braddell.<ref name=ReferenceA/>\n\n===Attorney-general, Singapore===\nIn 1864 he was appointed as [[Crown Counsel]],<ref name=tom/> and when the Transfer took place was appointed [[Attorney-General]] in 1867,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=23334|date=20 December 1867|page=6933}}</ref> an office which he held until the end of 1882. In February 1858 Mr. Braddell had written a pamphlet entitled \" Singapore and the [[Straits Settlements]] Described,\" because of the agitation then going on about the Transfer. In this pamphlet (which proved very useful and most opportune) he discussed the best way of governing and administering the Straits, and several of his suggestions were adopted. He wanted the Government of the Straits to be quite distinct from that of India, and that the sources from which the officials were derived should also be distinct. The pamphlet was a remarkable piece of constructive statesmanship, and showed his fitness for the high office to which he was appointed when his suggestions came to be put into practice. He was a most indefatigable worker, and used to sit up very late at night at his work.<ref>One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 424\u2013425</ref>\n\n===Many hats: public servant, private practitioner, Malay scholar, historian===\nIn addition to his multifarious duties, he found or made time to become a fine Malay scholar, to write innumerable articles in [[Singapore Free Press|Logan's Journal]], and to collect material for a history of Singapore, which, however, he never actually wrote, but which was the foundation of Mr. Charles Burton Buckley's \"An Anecdotal History of Old Times in Singapore\", and indeed prompted Mr. Buckley to undertake that most valuable work. Mr. Braddell was certainly one of the busiest men of his day, his court practice (for the Attorney-General was allowed private practice at that time) was very large and lucrative, his duties as Attorney-General were very heavy, but he always found time for public work. As Mr. Buckley put it in his history, \" there are some who wonder why Mr. Braddell, who was a very busy man, should have spent so much time and taken so much trouble about the stories of this place ; but he was one of those, like Mr. [[John Crawfurd]], [[John Turnbull Thomson]], [[George Windsor Earl]], John Cameron (author of Our tropical possessions in Malayan India), and others, who were very willing to use their spare time in endeavouring to record the history of the place, the growing importance of which they foresaw and appreciated.\"<ref>One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 425</ref>\n\n===Andrew Clarke and the Pangkor Treaty===\nWhen [[Andrew Clarke (British Army officer, born 1824)|Sir Andrew Clarke]] was sent out with orders to solve the problem of the Native States, he relied very strongly on Mr. Braddell, and appointed him [[Colonial Secretary, Straits Settlements|Colonial Secretary]] and Secretary for Affairs relating to the Native States in 1875. To Mr. Braddell was due much of the success of the conference which concluded the [[Pangkor Treaty of 1874|Treaty of Pangkor]] in 1874, which Sir Andrew described as \"the very best stroke of policy that has occurred since the British flag was seen in the Archipelago.\"<ref>One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 425\u2013426</ref>\n\nHe was exceedingly popular with all the Malay chiefs and principal men, who used to come from all parts to consult him. Being a very fine Malay scholar and having a most courteous manner, he was able to exert great influence with them, the following instance of which is given in Sir Andrew Clarke's diary.<ref name=ReferenceB>One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 426</ref>\n\nIn February 1874 Sir Andrew Clarke, with Admiral Sir [[Charles Shadwell (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Shadwell]], went up to Selangor, and arrived at Langat, the residence of the [[Sultan of Selangor]] and the pirates' headquarters. The place was strongly fortified with big guns, and as Sir Andrew wrote in his diary, \" the fort itself, both inside and outside, was covered with some hundreds of very villainous-looking Malays armed to the teeth.\" Major [[John Frederick Adolphus McNair]], with a party, was sent ashore to ask the Sultan to come off and see His Excellency, but the Sultan refused, and Major McNair, after waiting three hours, returned, having effected nothing. Sir Andrew's diary then proceeds:\n\n\"Braddell, my Attorney-General, then landed alone, smoking a cigar, as if for a stroll, lounged through the bazaar and town, passed the sentries, and stepped quietly into the Sultan's palace. Braddell speaks Malay better than a Malay, and knows their customs. It ended in his getting at the Sultan, who at last con- sented to come on board.\"<ref name=ReferenceB/>\n\n==Braddell, the man==\nOf Mr. Braddell's personal qualities Mr. Buckley, who was his lifelong friend, speaks highly:\n\n\"He was a man of great quickness of perception, great energy of purpose, and unwearied industry. He was, in his comparatively younger days, when he first came to Singapore, one of the most popular men of the place. He was a capital billiard player, and was to be seen in the theatre when any travelling company gave performances there, which were poor enough ; but he used to say that it passed an evening occasionally, however bad the players were, and made a little diversion from work.<ref>One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 426\u2013427</ref>\n\n\"It was always pleasant to the jury to hear him conducting the cases at the Assizes, for he was most essentially a kind-hearted, straightforward man, with a very pleasant, perfectly audible voice, and a fluent but very simple speaker. He had a very pleasant face and manner, and it was said of him after the Transfer that he was the only official who could carry off the civil service uniform which came into use then among some, but not all, the officials, for he had a fine figure, and was over six feet in height.\"<ref name=ReferenceC>One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 427</ref>\n\n==Later years==\n===Mishap and retirement===\nTowards the end of 1882, Braddell had a nasty carriage accident, and as a consequence had to retire; he was entertained before his departure at a farewell dinner given by the Bar and the Civil Service, at which the chief justice, Sir [[Thomas Sidgreaves]], took the chair, and the governor was present as a guest. All the members of council, heads of department, most of the civil service and all the bar were present, so the papers said. In proposing the toast of the evening, the chief justice said that the news of Braddell's retirement had been received with incredulity:\n\n\"One could hardly understand that Mr. Braddell, who had become a sort of institution here, whom everyone of us had known so long, who had become a part and parcel of the Colonial regime under which we all live, was going to leave us, that we were to lose the benefit of his assistance. It seemed as if a Colonial calamity was impending. Because I do not think there is anyone in the whole Colony who from his long residence and unselfish devotion to the public weal is so universally respected and whose absence will be more regretted.\"<ref name=ReferenceC/>\n\n===Death and testimony===\nHe died in London on 19 September 1891, at the age of sixty-eight.<ref name=tom/> The Supreme Court assembled in Singapore to do honour to his memory, and speeches were made by the attorney-general, Mr. Jonas Daniel Vaughan, his old friend and colleague, and by the chief justice, Sir Edward L. O'Malley.  The ''Singapore Free Press'', in an obituary notice, remarked that there were very few institutions in this place which did not in some way, to those who were acquainted with their history, recall him, and that that was especially the case among the Masonic fraternity. It went on to refer to the fine work done by many of the old officials of the East India Company, and concluded : \"Foremost amongst them stands the name of Mr. Braddell, who for thorough honesty of purpose and uprightness of character in somewhat trying official duties has left an honoured name in the history of the earlier days of Singapore.\" Mr. Braddell had filled all the offices connected with Freemasonry in his day, save that of District Grand Master, which was held by his friend, the late Mr. [[William Henry Macleod Read]], whose deputy he was.<ref name=p428>One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 428</ref>\n\n==Family==\nIn 1852 he married Miss Anne Lee,<ref name=tom/> the daughter of William Lee, of Longeaton, Notts., in his day a well-known amateur cricketer who played for Nottinghamshire. By her he had two sons and two daughters; one of the daughter (Honoria Clementina Mary Braddell) married Sir [[Edward Marsh Merewether]], K.C.V.O., K.C.M.G., then a cadet in the Straits Civil Service, and at present Governor of the Leeward Isles. They were on the Appam when she was captured by the ''Moewe'', the German raider. She played a large part in theatricals and music while she was in Singapore.<ref name=p428/>\n\n===Sir Thomas de Multon Lee Braddell===\nOf his sons the elder, Sir Thomas de Multon Lee Braddell, went out to Singapore in 1879, having been married a month or two before he sailed. He joined his father in practice. J. P. Joaquim and Sir John Bromhead Matthews were also partners of his, the former in the 'Eighties and the latter in the 'Nineties.  Sir Thomas, while he was at the Bar, did not take any part in public affairs save when he acted as Attorney-General in 1898, and for a year or two prior to that as a Municipal Commissioner. In 1907 he was appointed a Puisne Judge, and in 1911 he became Attorney-General, holding that appointment until 1913, when he went to the Federated Malay States as Chief Judicial Commissioner. In the New Year's honours of 1914 he received a knighthood, and in 1917 he retired, and thereafter lived in England. Sir Thomas, like his father, was an enthusiastic Freemason, and in his time was Master of Lodge St. George and first Master of Read Lodge, Kuala Lumpur, holding the two offices by special dispensation in the same year; he was also District Grand Senior Warden.<ref>One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 428\u2013429</ref>\n\nSir Thomas was a very good actor in his younger days, and was particularly successful as General Baltic in ''Turned up'', by Mark Melford, and as Digby Grant in ''Two Roses'', by James Albery. These were played at the old Town Hall in 1887 with great success.  He also stage-managed Iolanthe, which started an era of musical plays in October 1889, and the Crimson Scarf, a comic opera by H. B. Farnie and J. E. Legouix, in 1888 ; nor was he above giving an evening a week to coach the elder pupils of Raffles Girls' School in their Shakespeare. Although not very robust, he played a fair game at tennis, a good game of billiards, and was a staunch supporter of the Swimming Club, which has a fine portrait of their former President in the club-house.  All who knew him had the highest esteem for his fine character and sterling work. In Council and Court he was courteous in demean- our and quiet in speech, yet withal firm and decisive.  Privately, no one ever appealed to him in vain for advice or help, which he gave with great sincerity and kindness, in his quiet way, well meriting the verdict of one troubled lady whom he aided in a troublesome piece of public work that \" he was such a helpful man.\"<ref>One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 429</ref>\n\nSir Thomas de Multon Lee Braddell was born in Province Wellesley in 25 November 1856,<ref name=who>{{citeweb|url=http://www.ukwhoswho.com/search?q=Thomas+Braddell&searchBtn=Search&isQuickSearch=true|title=Braddell, Sir Thomas de Multon Lee|work=ukwhoswho|date=1 December 2007}}</ref> and after leaving Oxford was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple on 25 June 1879. On the 16 September 1879 he married Violet Ida Nassau, daughter of John Roberts Kirby by his wife Elizabeth, who was the daughter of William Frederick Nassau, of St. Osyth's Priory, Essex.<ref name=who/> He was admitted to the local Bar on 5 January 1880.<ref>One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 429\u2013430</ref> He died on 31 January 1927 after an influenza attack.<ref name=who/><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1211_2008-01-30.html|title=Thomas de Multon Lee Braddell|work=SingaporeInfopedia|date=8 July 2016|author=Joshua Chia Yeong Jia}}</ref>\n\n===Robert Wallace Braddell===\nThe younger son of Thomas Braddell, Robert Wallace, also came out to the Straits after his father's retirement and practised at the Singapore Bar in partnership with his brother. Sir Thomas, until December 1906, when he retired. He was the finest criminal lawyer and cross-examiner who has practised at the local Bar. He was a very fine billiard and lawn-tennis player, gaining the championship many times at both games. In no less than three separate tournaments R. W. Braddell secured the championship, the singles handicap, the doubles handicap, and the Profession Pairs, i.e. every event. He and the Hon. F. M. Elliot carried off the Profession Pairs on many occasions. Also \" Bob \" was an admirable caricaturist, much of his work being shown in illustrations herein, and under the nom de plume of \"K.Y.D\" had cartoons of [[Sir Cecil Smith]], the Maharaja of Johore, and others published in the Vanity Fair series.  Straits Produce contains much of his hterary and artistic work. He shared the family taste for theatricals, and appeared in comic parts on many occasions, and could sing a good comic song.  Robert Wallace Glen Lee Braddell was born in 1859, won his tennis half-blue at Oxford, and was amateur lawn tennis champion of the North of England.  He married Minnie, daughter of the Rev. Thomas Smith, vicar of Brailes, near Banbury.<ref>One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 430\u2013431</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|title=The Law of the Straits Settlements: A Commentary|author=Braddell, R.

Wicklow.<ref>One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 423</ref>\n\n===Sugar planter===\nAt the age of nearly seventeen he went to [[Demerara]] with his brother, George William, to learn sugar planting. The brother died there in 1840, and in 1844 Thomas Braddell arrived at [[Penang]] from Demerara to manage the sugar estate called Otaheite, in the [[Air Itam|Ayer Hitam]] Valley, which belonged to Messrs. Brown and Co. About this time a great impetus had been given to the sugar industry in the Straits by the new sugar duties, with the result that Brown and Co. opened in 1846 the [[Batu Kawan]] Estate, in [[Province Wellesley]], of which Mr. Braddell became the manager and owner of one quarter ; but the estate got inundated in a very high tide, the crop was lost, and the venture ended.<ref>One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 423\u2013424</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Public service in Penang===\nOn 1 January 1849 Mr. Braddell joined the service of the [[East India Company]] as Deputy Superintendent of Police at Penang. After holding various offices in Penang, the Province, and [[Malacca]], he was promoted to the highest position which any uncovenanted servant of the Company had ever held, that of Assistant Resident Councillor, Penang, a post which had previously been held by a covenanted civilian or high military officer. He earned this promotion for an act which made him famous at the time, and gained him the quickest promotion in Government service then known. In 1854 the most serious clan riots ever known broke out in Singapore, and the feud spread to Malacca, where the Chinese broke out, took possession of the country parts, and built a stockade in one of the main roads, where they defied the police. Mr. Braddell, who was at that time stationed in Malacca, without the slightest assistance and without calling on the military, went out with all the police he could get together, attacked the Chinese, killed and wounded several of them, took the stockade, and summarily ended the riots, for which act he was publicly thanked by the Governor.<ref name=ReferenceA>One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 424</ref>\n\n===Barrister of Gray's Inn===\nHe was not satisfied with his prospects in the Company as an uncovenanted servant, and commenced to study for the Bar, a natural bent, seeing that from 1801 relatives of his had been at the [[Irish Bar]]. On 10 June 1859 he was called at [[Gray's Inn]] ; in 1862 he resigned the Company's service and went to Singapore, where he commenced practice in partnership with Mr. [[Abraham Logan]], as Logan and Braddell.<ref name=ReferenceA/>\n\n===Attorney-general, Singapore===\nIn 1864 he was appointed as [[Crown Counsel]],<ref name=tom/> and when the Transfer took place was appointed [[Attorney-General]] in 1867,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=23334|date=20 December 1867|page=6933}}</ref> an office which he held until the end of 1882. In February 1858 Mr. Braddell had written a pamphlet entitled \" Singapore and the [[Straits Settlements]] Described,\" because of the agitation then going on about the Transfer. In this pamphlet (which proved very useful and most opportune) he discussed the best way of governing and administering the Straits, and several of his suggestions were adopted. He wanted the Government of the Straits to be quite distinct from that of India, and that the sources from which the officials were derived should also be distinct. The pamphlet was a remarkable piece of constructive statesmanship, and showed his fitness for the high office to which he was appointed when his suggestions came to be put into practice. He was a most indefatigable worker, and used to sit up very late at night at his work.<ref>One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 424\u2013425</ref>\n\n===Many hats: public servant, private practitioner, Malay scholar, historian===\nIn addition to his multifarious duties, he found or made time to become a fine Malay scholar, to write innumerable articles in [[Singapore Free Press|Logan's Journal]], and to collect material for a history of Singapore, which, however, he never actually wrote, but which was the foundation of Mr. Charles Burton Buckley's \"An Anecdotal History of Old Times in Singapore\", and indeed prompted Mr. Buckley to undertake that most valuable work. Mr. Braddell was certainly one of the busiest men of his day, his court practice (for the Attorney-General was allowed private practice at that time) was very large and lucrative, his duties as Attorney-General were very heavy, but he always found time for public work. As Mr. Buckley put it in his history, \" there are some who wonder why Mr. Braddell, who was a very busy man, should have spent so much time and taken so much trouble about the stories of this place ; but he was one of those, like Mr. [[John Crawfurd]], [[John Turnbull Thomson]], [[George Windsor Earl]], John Cameron (author of Our tropical possessions in Malayan India), and others, who were very willing to use their spare time in endeavouring to record the history of the place, the growing importance of which they foresaw and appreciated.\"<ref>One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 425</ref>\n\n===Andrew Clarke and the Pangkor Treaty===\nWhen [[Andrew Clarke (administrator)|Sir Andrew Clarke]] was sent out with orders to solve the problem of the Native States, he relied very strongly on Mr. Braddell, and appointed him [[Colonial Secretary, Straits Settlements|Colonial Secretary]] and Secretary for Affairs relating to the Native States in 1875. To Mr. Braddell was due much of the success of the conference which concluded the [[Pangkor Treaty of 1874|Treaty of Pangkor]] in 1874, which Sir Andrew described as \"the very best stroke of policy that has occurred since the British flag was seen in the Archipelago.\"<ref>One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 425\u2013426</ref>\n\nHe was exceedingly popular with all the Malay chiefs and principal men, who used to come from all parts to consult him. Being a very fine Malay scholar and having a most courteous manner, he was able to exert great influence with them, the following instance of which is given in Sir Andrew Clarke's diary.<ref name=ReferenceB>One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 426</ref>\n\nIn February 1874 Sir Andrew Clarke, with Admiral Sir [[Charles Shadwell (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Shadwell]], went up to Selangor, and arrived at Langat, the residence of the [[Sultan of Selangor]] and the pirates' headquarters. The place was strongly fortified with big guns, and as Sir Andrew wrote in his diary, \" the fort itself, both inside and outside, was covered with some hundreds of very villainous-looking Malays armed to the teeth.\" Major [[John Frederick Adolphus McNair]], with a party, was sent ashore to ask the Sultan to come off and see His Excellency, but the Sultan refused, and Major McNair, after waiting three hours, returned, having effected nothing. Sir Andrew's diary then proceeds:\n\n\"Braddell, my Attorney-General, then landed alone, smoking a cigar, as if for a stroll, lounged through the bazaar and town, passed the sentries, and stepped quietly into the Sultan's palace. Braddell speaks Malay better than a Malay, and knows their customs. It ended in his getting at the Sultan, who at last con- sented to come on board.\"<ref name=ReferenceB/>\n\n==Braddell, the man==\nOf Mr. Braddell's personal qualities Mr. Buckley, who was his lifelong friend, speaks highly:\n\n\"He was a man of great quickness of perception, great energy of purpose, and unwearied industry. He was, in his comparatively younger days, when he first came to Singapore, one of the most popular men of the place. He was a capital billiard player, and was to be seen in the theatre when any travelling company gave performances there, which were poor enough ; but he used to say that it passed an evening occasionally, however bad the players were, and made a little diversion from work.<ref>One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 426\u2013427</ref>\n\n\"It was always pleasant to the jury to hear him conducting the cases at the Assizes, for he was most essentially a kind-hearted, straightforward man, with a very pleasant, perfectly audible voice, and a fluent but very simple speaker. He had a very pleasant face and manner, and it was said of him after the Transfer that he was the only official who could carry off the civil service uniform which came into use then among some, but not all, the officials, for he had a fine figure, and was over six feet in height.\"<ref name=ReferenceC>One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 427</ref>\n\n==Later years==\n===Mishap and retirement===\nTowards the end of 1882, Braddell had a nasty carriage accident, and as a consequence had to retire; he was entertained before his departure at a farewell dinner given by the Bar and the Civil Service, at which the chief justice, Sir [[Thomas Sidgreaves]], took the chair, and the governor was present as a guest. All the members of council, heads of department, most of the civil service and all the bar were present, so the papers said. In proposing the toast of the evening, the chief justice said that the news of Braddell's retirement had been received with incredulity:\n\n\"One could hardly understand that Mr. Braddell, who had become a sort of institution here, whom everyone of us had known so long, who had become a part and parcel of the Colonial regime under which we all live, was going to leave us, that we were to lose the benefit of his assistance. It seemed as if a Colonial calamity was impending. Because I do not think there is anyone in the whole Colony who from his long residence and unselfish devotion to the public weal is so universally respected and whose absence will be more regretted.\"<ref name=ReferenceC/>\n\n===Death and testimony===\nHe died in London on 19 September 1891, at the age of sixty-eight.<ref name=tom/> The Supreme Court assembled in Singapore to do honour to his memory, and speeches were made by the attorney-general, Mr. Jonas Daniel Vaughan, his old friend and colleague, and by the chief justice, Sir Edward L. O'Malley.  The ''Singapore Free Press'', in an obituary notice, remarked that there were very few institutions in this place which did not in some way, to those who were acquainted with their history, recall him, and that that was especially the case among the Masonic fraternity. It went on to refer to the fine work done by many of the old officials of the East India Company, and concluded : \"Foremost amongst them stands the name of Mr. Braddell, who for thorough honesty of purpose and uprightness of character in somewhat trying official duties has left an honoured name in the history of the earlier days of Singapore.\" Mr. Braddell had filled all the offices connected with Freemasonry in his day, save that of District Grand Master, which was held by his friend, the late Mr. [[William Henry Macleod Read]], whose deputy he was.<ref name=p428>One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 428</ref>\n\n==Family==\nIn 1852 he married Miss Anne Lee,<ref name=tom/> the daughter of William Lee, of Longeaton, Notts., in his day a well-known amateur cricketer who played for Nottinghamshire. By her he had two sons and two daughters; one of the daughter (Honoria Clementina Mary Braddell) married Sir [[Edward Marsh Merewether]], K.C.V.O., K.C.M.G., then a cadet in the Straits Civil Service, and at present Governor of the Leeward Isles. They were on the Appam when she was captured by the ''Moewe'', the German raider. She played a large part in theatricals and music while she was in Singapore.<ref name=p428/>\n\n===Sir Thomas de Multon Lee Braddell===\nOf his sons the elder, Sir Thomas de Multon Lee Braddell, went out to Singapore in 1879, having been married a month or two before he sailed. He joined his father in practice. J. P. Joaquim and Sir John Bromhead Matthews were also partners of his, the former in the 'Eighties and the latter in the 'Nineties.  Sir Thomas, while he was at the Bar, did not take any part in public affairs save when he acted as Attorney-General in 1898, and for a year or two prior to that as a Municipal Commissioner. In 1907 he was appointed a Puisne Judge, and in 1911 he became Attorney-General, holding that appointment until 1913, when he went to the Federated Malay States as Chief Judicial Commissioner. In the New Year's honours of 1914 he received a knighthood, and in 1917 he retired, and thereafter lived in England. Sir Thomas, like his father, was an enthusiastic Freemason, and in his time was Master of Lodge St. George and first Master of Read Lodge, Kuala Lumpur, holding the two offices by special dispensation in the same year; he was also District Grand Senior Warden.<ref>One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 428\u2013429</ref>\n\nSir Thomas was a very good actor in his younger days, and was particularly successful as General Baltic in ''Turned up'', by Mark Melford, and as Digby Grant in ''Two Roses'', by James Albery. These were played at the old Town Hall in 1887 with great success.  He also stage-managed Iolanthe, which started an era of musical plays in October 1889, and the Crimson Scarf, a comic opera by H. B. Farnie and J. E. Legouix, in 1888 ; nor was he above giving an evening a week to coach the elder pupils of Raffles Girls' School in their Shakespeare. Although not very robust, he played a fair game at tennis, a good game of billiards, and was a staunch supporter of the Swimming Club, which has a fine portrait of their former President in the club-house.  All who knew him had the highest esteem for his fine character and sterling work. In Council and Court he was courteous in demean- our and quiet in speech, yet withal firm and decisive.  Privately, no one ever appealed to him in vain for advice or help, which he gave with great sincerity and kindness, in his quiet way, well meriting the verdict of one troubled lady whom he aided in a troublesome piece of public work that \" he was such a helpful man.\"<ref>One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 429</ref>\n\nSir Thomas de Multon Lee Braddell was born in Province Wellesley in 25 November 1856,<ref name=who>{{citeweb|url=http://www.ukwhoswho.com/search?q=Thomas+Braddell&searchBtn=Search&isQuickSearch=true|title=Braddell, Sir Thomas de Multon Lee|work=ukwhoswho|date=1 December 2007}}</ref> and after leaving Oxford was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple on 25 June 1879.

Sir Thomas, until December 1906, when he retired. He was the finest criminal lawyer and cross-examiner who has practised at the local Bar. He was a very fine billiard and lawn-tennis player, gaining the championship many times at both games. In no less than three separate tournaments R. W. Braddell secured the championship, the singles handicap, the doubles handicap, and the Profession Pairs, i.e. every event. He and the Hon. F. M. Elliot carried off the Profession Pairs on many occasions. Also \" Bob \" was an admirable caricaturist, much of his work being shown in illustrations herein, and under the nom de plume of \"K.Y.D\" had cartoons of [[Sir Cecil Smith]], the Maharaja of Johore, and others published in the Vanity Fair series.  Straits Produce contains much of his hterary and artistic work. He shared the family taste for theatricals, and appeared in comic parts on many occasions, and could sing a good comic song.  Robert Wallace Glen Lee Braddell was born in 1859, won his tennis half-blue at Oxford, and was amateur lawn tennis champion of the North of England.  He married Minnie, daughter of the Rev. Thomas Smith, vicar of Brailes, near Banbury.<ref>One Hundred Years of Singapore, Pg 430\u2013431</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|title=The Law of the Straits Settlements: A Commentary|author=Braddell, R.

Stawell had to establish a police force, frame regulations for the government of the goldfields, appoint magistrates and officials of every grade, and protect life and property against the perceived threat of the hordes of gold rush adventurers who arrived in Victoria, first from the neighbouring colonies, and later from Europe and America. Much was owed to the firm administration of Stawell that, at a time when the government was weak, and many of the newcomers impatient of control, [[lynch law]] was never resorted to.\n\nRather than export duty on gold, Stawell supported a miners' licensing system, which was one of the major grievances leading to the [[Eureka Rebellion]] in [[Ballarat]] in 1854.<ref name=adb/> Referring to the miners as \"wandering vagabonds\" and \"vagrants\", Stawell was the prosecutor in the unsuccessful case against the rebel leaders charged with [[high treason]].<ref name=adb/>\n\nStawell had very little assistance for some time from any of his colleagues, and until the Executive Council was strengthened by the admission of [[Andrew Clarke (British Army officer, born 1824)|Captain Andrew Clarke]] and [[Hugh Culling Eardley Childers|Hugh Culling Childers]], Stawell was the brains as well as the body of the administration.<ref name=EB/> The success of his policy was upon the whole remarkable.

Stawell bore an active part in drafting the Constitution Act which gave to Victoria representative institutions and a responsible ministry, instead of an executive appointed and removable by the governor and a legislature in which one-third of the members were chosen by the Crown.<ref name=EB/>\n\nAt the first general election after the new constitution in 1856 Stawell was returned as one of the [[Electoral district of Melbourne|Members for Melbourne]], and became the attorney-general of the first responsible ministry.

Stawell was the first [[Attorney-General of Victoria (Australia)|Attorney-General of Victoria]], serving from 1851 to 1856 as an appointed official sitting in the [[Legislative Council of Victoria|Victorian Legislative Council]], and from 1856 until 1857, as an elected politician, representing [[Electoral district of Melbourne|Melbourne]].\n\n==Early life==\nStawell was born in Old Court, [[County Cork]], Ireland the second son of ten children of Jonas Stawell, and his wife Anna, second daughter of the Right Reverend [[William Foster (bishop)|William Foster]], [[Bishop of Clogher (Church of Ireland)|bishop of Clogher]].<ref name=adb>\n{{Australian Dictionary of Biography\n |last=Francis |first=Charles\n |year=1976\n |volume=6\n |id2=stawell-sir-william-foster-4635\n |pp=174\u2013177\n |title=Stawell, Sir William  Foster (1815\u20131889)\n |accessdate=2 January 2014}}</ref>\n<ref name=Mennell>{{cite Australasia|Stawell, Hon.

He practised law in Ireland until 1842 when he decided to emigrate to Australia.<ref name=adb/><ref name=EB/>\n\n==Australia==\nStawell was admitted to the [[Port Phillip District]] bar in 1843.<ref name=adb/> He engaged extensively in pastoral pursuits, and had sheep stations at [[Natte Yallock, Victoria]], on the banks of the [[Avoca River]], and in the neighbourhood of [[Lake Wallace]], near the South Australian border.<ref name=EB/> When [[Charles Perry (bishop)|Charles Perry]] came to Australia as first bishop of Melbourne, Stawell helped him to form a constitution for the newly created diocese. His first cousins and fellow Anglo-Irish, the brothers [[William Andreas Salicus Fane De Salis|William]] and [[Cuppacumbalong Homestead|Leopold de Salis]] also went to Australia in the 1840s.\n\n==Attorney-general==\nFor many years Stawell enjoyed the leading practice at the local bar, and when the Port Phillip district of [[New South Wales]] was separated from the parent colony, and entered upon an independent existence as the [[Victoria (Australia)|Colony of Victoria]], Stawell accepted the position of Attorney-General<ref name=EB/> on 15 July 1851<ref name=Stat>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/papers/govpub/VPARL1908No10.pdf\n |title=Statistical Register of the State of Victoria\n |year=1908\n |accessdate=10 August 2014\n}}</ref> and became a member of the Executive Council and the [[Victorian Legislative Council|Legislative Council]].\n\nA few weeks after Stawell's appointment [[Victorian Gold Rush|gold was discovered in Victoria]]; the duty of creating a system of government which could cope adequately with the situation fell to him. Stawell had to establish a police force, frame regulations for the government of the goldfields, appoint magistrates and officials of every grade, and protect life and property against the perceived threat of the hordes of gold rush adventurers who arrived in Victoria, first from the neighbouring colonies, and later from Europe and America. Much was owed to the firm administration of Stawell that, at a time when the government was weak, and many of the newcomers impatient of control, [[lynch law]] was never resorted to.\n\nRather than export duty on gold, Stawell supported a miners' licensing system, which was one of the major grievances leading to the [[Eureka Rebellion]] in [[Ballarat]] in 1854.<ref name=adb/> Referring to the miners as \"wandering vagabonds\" and \"vagrants\", Stawell was the prosecutor in the unsuccessful case against the rebel leaders charged with [[high treason]].<ref name=adb/>\n\nStawell had very little assistance for some time from any of his colleagues, and until the Executive Council was strengthened by the admission of [[Andrew Clarke (administrator)|Captain Andrew Clarke]] and [[Hugh Culling Eardley Childers|Hugh Culling Childers]], Stawell was the brains as well as the body of the administration.<ref name=EB/> The success of his policy was upon the whole remarkable. In the legislature he was sometimes opposed, and at other times assisted, by [[John O'Shanassy]], who was the leader of the popular party, and between them they managed to pass a number of statutes which added greatly to the prosperity of the colony.<ref name=EB/> A political contemporary, [[Henry Samuel Chapman]], spoke of him as \u201calmost the only efficient man connected with the government.\u201d\n\n==Constitution Act==\nStawell was indefatigable in the discharge of his duties, and extraordinary stories are told of the long journeys on horseback to visit distant outposts which he would take after being all day long in the law courts or in the council chamber. Stawell bore an active part in drafting the Constitution Act which gave to Victoria representative institutions and a responsible ministry, instead of an executive appointed and removable by the governor and a legislature in which one-third of the members were chosen by the Crown.<ref name=EB/>\n\nAt the first general election after the new constitution in 1856 Stawell was returned as one of the [[Electoral district of Melbourne|Members for Melbourne]], and became the attorney-general of the first responsible ministry. In 1857, on the resignation of the chief justice, [[William \u00e0 Beckett|Sir William \u00e0 Beckett]], he succeeded to the vacant post, and was created a [[knight bachelor]]. He administered the government of Victoria in 1873, 1875\u20131876, and 1884.\n\n==Legacy==\nStawell did not leave Australia from his arrival in 1843 until 1872, when he paid short visits to the neighbouring colonies and [[New Zealand]], and 1873, when he returned to Europe on two years\u2019 leave of absence.<ref name=EB/> Stawell took a very deep interest in the proceedings of the [[Church of England]], and was a member of the synod.<ref name=EB/> On his retirement from the bench in 1886 he was created {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|KCMG}}.<ref name=EB/> Stawell died at [[Naples]], Italy on 12 March 1889.<ref name=adb/>\n\nThe family house [[D'Estaville]], built in 1859, still stands in the inner [[Melbourne]] suburb of  [[Kew, Victoria|Kew]].\n\nThe town of [[Stawell, Victoria]] was named in his honour.\n\n==Family==\nIn 1856 Stawell married Mary Frances Elizabeth Greene, only daughter of W.P.
