{"title_page": "North Texas", "text_new": "{{about|the region of Texas|the \nuniversity in Denton|University of North Texas}}\n\n[[Image:North_Texas_map.png|thumb|200px|Map of North Texas]]\n\n'''North Texas''' (also commonly called '''North Central Texas''', '''Northeastern Texas''', and '''Nortex''') is a term used primarily by residents of Dallas, Fort Worth, and surrounding areas to describe much of the northern portion of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Texas]]. Residents of the [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex]] generally consider North Texas to include the area south of [[Oklahoma]], east of [[Abilene, Texas|Abilene]], west of [[Paris, Texas|Paris]], and north of [[Waco, Texas|Waco]]. A more precise term for this region would be the northern part of the central portion of Texas. It does not include the [[Texas Panhandle|Panhandle of Texas]], which expands further north than the region previously described, nor does it include most of the region near the northern border of Texas.\n\nToday North Texas is centered upon the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth Metroplex, the largest [[metropolitan area]] in Texas and the [[Southern United States]]. People in the [[Dallas]] and [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] areas sometimes use the terms \"Metroplex\", \"DFW\", and \"North Texas\" interchangeably. However, North Texas refers to a much larger area that includes many rural counties along the northern border.<ref>[http://www.w5jck.com/maps/map_of_north_texas_counties.html W5JCK Map of North-Central Texas Counties<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> During the early years of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], there were many [[Union (American Civil War)|Unionists]] in the rural counties, as there were few slaveholders. Many of the largest cities in North Texas outside Dallas and Fort Worth still follow a rural [[Southern United States|Southern]] way of life, especially in dialect, mannerisms, religion, and [[Cuisine of the Southern United States|cuisine]].\n\n==Climate==\nThe North Texas climate is [[subtropical climate|subtropical]] with hot summers. It is also [[continental climate|continental]], characterized by a wide annual temperature range. Average annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] also varies considerably, ranging from less than 28 to more than 48 inches (700\u20131200&nbsp;mm). Severe [[storm]]s are frequent in the spring, as the area lies in the southern section of \"[[tornado alley]]\".\n\nSouth is the prevailing wind direction, and southerly winds are frequently high and persist for several days. Strong northerly winds often occur during the passage of cold fronts. Dusty conditions are infrequent, occurring mostly with westerly winds. [[Dust storm]] frequency and intensity depend on soil conditions in eastern [[New Mexico]], west Texas, and the [[Texas Panhandle]].\n\nWinters are mild, but northers occur about three times each month, and often are accompanied by sudden drops in temperature. In Dallas, a record-setting 12.8 inches of snow  fell in February 2011. Periods of extreme cold that occasionally occur are short-lived, so that even in January mild weather occurs frequently.\n\nThe highest temperatures of summer are associated with fair skies, westerly winds and low humidities. Characteristically, hot spells in summer are broken into three- to five-day periods by [[thunderstorm]] activity. There are only a few nights each summer when the low temperature exceeds 80&nbsp;\u00b0F (27&nbsp;\u00b0C). Summer daytime temperatures frequently exceed 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (38&nbsp;\u00b0C). Air conditioners are recommended for maximum comfort indoors and while traveling via automobile.\n\nThroughout the year, rainfall occurs more frequently during the night. Usually, periods of rainy weather last for only a day or two, and are followed by several days with fair skies. A large part of the annual precipitation results from thunderstorm activity, with occasional heavy rainfall over brief periods of time. Thunderstorms occur throughout the year, but are most frequent in the spring. [[Hail]] falls on about two or three days a year, ordinarily with only slight and scattered damage. Windstorms occurring during thunderstorm activity are sometimes destructive. [[Snow]]fall is uncommon.\n\nThe average length of the warm season (freeze-free period) is about 249 days. The average last occurrence of 32&nbsp;\u00b0F (0&nbsp;\u00b0C) or below is mid March and the average first occurrence of 32&nbsp;\u00b0F or below is in late November.<ref>https://www.weather.gov/fwd/dnarrative</ref>\n\n==Counties==\nAlthough the terms \"Northeastern Texas\" or \"North Texas\" are not official state designations, the Texas State Data Center and Office of the State Demographer lists the following counties as belonging to the '''[[North Central Texas Council of Governments]] (NCTCOG)''':<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://txsdc.utsa.edu/tpepp/cog_list.php Counties by Regional Councils of Governments<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.nctcog.org/regional_map.asp www.NCTCOG.org<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n{{col-begin|width=40%}}\n{{col-break}}\n*[[Collin County, Texas|Collin]] \n*[[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas]]\n*[[Denton County, Texas|Denton]]\n*[[Ellis County, Texas|Ellis]]\n*[[Erath County, Texas|Erath]]\n*[[Hood County, Texas|Hood]]\n*[[Hunt County, Texas|Hunt]]\n{{col-break}}\n*[[Johnson County, Texas|Johnson]]\n*[[Kaufman County, Texas|Kaufman]]\n*[[Navarro County, Texas|Navarro]]\n*[[Palo Pinto County, Texas|Palo Pinto]]\n*[[Parker County, Texas|Parker]]\n*[[Rockwall County, Texas|Rockwall]]\n{{col-break}}\n*[[Somervell County, Texas|Somervell]]\n*[[Tarrant County, Texas|Tarrant]]\n*[[Wise County, Texas|Wise]]\n{{col-end}}\n\nThe Texas State Demographer also lists the following regional county groupings, some or all of which are often included in the informal meaning of the terms \"North Texas\" or \"North Central Texas.\"\n\n{{col-begin|width=50%}}\n{{col-break}}\n'''[[Nortex Regional Planning Commission]]:'''<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref>[http://www.nortexrpc.org/sp/counties/main.htm Counties<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n*[[Archer County, Texas|Archer]]\n*[[Baylor County, Texas|Baylor]]\n*[[Clay County, Texas|Clay]]\n*[[Cottle County, Texas|Cottle]]\n*[[Foard County, Texas|Foard]]\n*[[Hardeman County, Texas|Hardeman]]\n*[[Jack County, Texas|Jack]]\n*[[Montague County, Texas|Montague]]\n*[[Wichita County, Texas|Wichita]]\n*[[Wilbarger County, Texas|Wilbarger]]\n*[[Young County, Texas|Young]]\n\n{{col-break}}\n'''[[Texoma Council of Governments]]:'''<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref>[http://www.texoma.cog.tx.us/ Texoma Council of Governments]</ref>\n*[[Cooke County, Texas|Cooke]]\n*[[Fannin County, Texas|Fannin]]\n*[[Grayson County, Texas|Grayson]]\n{{col-end}}\n\nAdditionally, some other Texas counties contiguous with those named above are sometimes included in the general meaning of \"North Texas.\"\n\n==Major cities==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"float:right border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse\"\n!

==\nThe North Texas region has teams from the four major professional sports leagues. Major professional sports first came to the area in 1960, when the [[Dallas Cowboys]] began competing in the [[National Football League]] and the Dallas Texans began competing in the [[American Football League]]. (The Texans later relocated to [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] and become the [[Kansas City Chiefs|Chiefs]]). In 1972, [[Major League Baseball|Major League Baseball's]] Washington Senators moved to Arlington to become the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], named after the [[Texas Ranger Division|statewide law enforcement agency]]. The [[National Basketball Association]] expanded into North Texas in 1980 when the [[Dallas Mavericks]] were added to the league. The fourth sport was added in 1993 when the [[Minnesota North Stars]] of the [[National Hockey League]] moved to Dallas, becoming the [[Dallas Stars]].\n\nThe [[Major League Soccer]] team [[FC Dallas]] is based in Frisco, and the [[Dallas Wings]] of the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]] plays in Arlington.  The area is also home to many minor-league professional teams, and four colleges that compete in [[NCAA]] [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] athletics.\n\n===Major professional sports teams===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \n!

Residents of the [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex]] generally consider North Texas to include the area south of [[Oklahoma]], east of [[Abilene, Texas|Abilene]], west of [[Paris, Texas|Paris]], and north of [[Waco, Texas|Waco]]. A more precise term for this region would be the northern part of the central portion of Texas. It does not include the [[Texas Panhandle|Panhandle of Texas]], which expands further north than the region previously described, nor does it include most of the region near the northern border of Texas.\n\nToday North Texas is centered upon the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth Metroplex, the largest [[metropolitan area]] in Texas and the [[Southern United States]]. People in the [[Dallas]] and [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] areas sometimes use the terms \"Metroplex\", \"DFW\", and \"North Texas\" interchangeably. However, North Texas refers to a much larger area that includes many rural counties along the northern border.<ref>[http://www.w5jck.com/maps/map_of_north_texas_counties.html W5JCK Map of North-Central Texas Counties<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> During the early years of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], there were many [[Union (American Civil War)|Unionists]] in the rural counties, as there were few slaveholders. Many of the largest cities in North Texas outside Dallas and Fort Worth still follow a rural [[Southern United States|Southern]] way of life, especially in dialect, mannerisms, religion, and [[Cuisine of the Southern United States|cuisine]].\n\n==Climate==\nThe North Texas climate is [[subtropical climate|subtropical]] with hot summers. It is also [[continental climate|continental]], characterized by a wide annual temperature range. Average annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] also varies considerably, ranging from less than 28 to more than 48 inches (700\u20131200&nbsp;mm). Severe [[storm]]s are frequent in the spring, as the area lies in the southern section of \"[[tornado alley]]\".\n\nSouth is the prevailing wind direction, and southerly winds are frequently high and persist for several days. Strong northerly winds often occur during the passage of cold fronts. Dusty conditions are infrequent, occurring mostly with westerly winds. [[Dust storm]] frequency and intensity depend on soil conditions in eastern [[New Mexico]], west Texas, and the [[Texas Panhandle]].\n\nWinters are mild, but northers occur about three times each month, and often are accompanied by sudden drops in temperature. In Dallas, a record-setting 12.8 inches of snow  fell in February 2011. Periods of extreme cold that occasionally occur are short-lived, so that even in January mild weather occurs frequently.\n\nThe highest temperatures of summer are associated with fair skies, westerly winds and low humidities. Characteristically, hot spells in summer are broken into three- to five-day periods by [[thunderstorm]] activity. There are only a few nights each summer when the low temperature exceeds 80&nbsp;\u00b0F (27&nbsp;\u00b0C). Summer daytime temperatures frequently exceed 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (38&nbsp;\u00b0C). Air conditioners are recommended for maximum comfort indoors and while traveling via automobile.\n\nThroughout the year, rainfall occurs more frequently during the night. Usually, periods of rainy weather last for only a day or two, and are followed by several days with fair skies. A large part of the annual precipitation results from thunderstorm activity, with occasional heavy rainfall over brief periods of time. Thunderstorms occur throughout the year, but are most frequent in the spring. [[Hail]] falls on about two or three days a year, ordinarily with only slight and scattered damage. Windstorms occurring during thunderstorm activity are sometimes destructive. [[Snow]]fall is uncommon.\n\nThe average length of the warm season (freeze-free period) is about 249 days.

==\nThe North Texas region has teams from the four major professional sports leagues. Major professional sports first came to the area in 1960, when the [[Dallas Cowboys]] began competing in the [[National Football League]] and the Dallas Texans began competing in the [[American Football League]]. (The Texans later relocated to [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] and become the [[Kansas City Chiefs|Chiefs]]). In 1972, [[Major League Baseball|Major League Baseball's]] Washington Senators moved to Arlington to become the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], named after the [[Texas Ranger Division|statewide law enforcement agency]]. The [[National Basketball Association]] expanded into North Texas in 1980 when the [[Dallas Mavericks]] were added to the league. The fourth sport was added in 1993 when the [[Minnesota North Stars]] of the [[National Hockey League]] moved to Dallas, becoming the [[Dallas Stars]].\n\nThe [[Major League Soccer]] team [[FC Dallas]] is based in Frisco, and the [[Dallas Wings]] of the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]] plays in Arlington.  The area is also home to many minor-league professional teams, and four colleges that compete in [[NCAA]] [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] athletics.\n\n===Major professional sports teams===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \n!

The song was serviced to US [[Hot adult contemporary|adult contemporary]] and [[Contemporary hit radio|pop]] radio formats on January 27 and 28, 2020 as the fourth single from Swift's seventh studio album, ''[[Lover (album)|Lover]]'' (2019)''.'' Swift wrote and produced the song with [[Joel Little]]. It is a [[synth-pop]] song which features flashy harmonies and murky synths. Over an uptempo production, Swift imagines the media's treatment of her if she were a man. The song received acclaim from critics, who praised its [[feminism|feminist]] message.\n\n\"The Man\" peaked at number 23 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming the fourth consecutive single from ''Lover'' to peak inside the top 40 of the chart. It also debuted at number 4 on the [[Rolling Stone Top 100|''Rolling Stone'' Top 100]]. It entered the top 40 on charts in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Ireland, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Slovakia and the United Kingdom. On February 7, 2020, an animated lyric video of the song was released on [[YouTube]]. On February 18, 2020, a live acoustic version of the song, titled \"The Man (Live from Paris)\", was released on all music platforms, accompanied by its live video. \n\nAn official music video for \"The Man\" was released on February 27, 2020 and was directed by Swift herself, marking her solo directorial debut. The [[Satire|satirical]] video sees Swift in her theoretical male alter-ego named \"Tyler Swift\", presenting several prevalent examples of double standards in society, including [[Sexual objectification|objectification]], [[Sexualization|sexualization of women]], [[toxic masculinity]] and [[patriarchy]].\n\n==Background and composition==\n[[File:Leonardo DiCaprio 2014.jpg|thumb|upright| American actor [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] is name-checked in the lyrics of the song, whose films, ''[[Inception]]'' and ''[[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|The Wolf of Wall Street]]'', are further referenced in its lyric video and music video, respectively.|alt=Leonardo DiCaprio attending a film premiere]]The recording process for [[Taylor Swift]]'s seventh studio album ''[[Lover (album)|Lover]]'' took under three months, and concluded in February 2019.<ref>{{cite web |last=Suskind |first=Alex |title=New Reputation: Taylor Swift shares intel on TS7, fan theories, and her next era |url=https://ew.com/music/2019/05/09/taylor-swift-cover-story/ |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=September 1, 2019 |date=May 9, 2019}}</ref> [[Joel Little]] was revealed as one of the producers for the album with the release of lead single \"[[Me!]]\" in April.

The video presents numerous prevalent examples of double standards in society, and comments on the [[Sexual objectification|objectification]] and [[Sexualization|sexualization of women]], [[toxic masculinity]], [[patriarchy]], as well as performative allyship. Throughout the video, the male version of Swift is seen rudely inconveniencing the people around him, leading a luxurious and promiscuous lifestyle, [[manspreading]], receiving praise for the bare minimum, and throwing [[Tantrum|tantrums]] without consequences. It contains visual references to ''[[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|The Wolf of Wall Street]]'', a film involving the lyrically name-checked actor [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and cinematographer Prieto, and tennis player [[Serena Williams]]' match controversy with a chair umpire at the [[2018 US Open (tennis)|2018 US Open Championships]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[File:Tyler Swift manspreading.jpeg|thumb|Swift's male alter-ego, Tyler Swift (in the middle), [[Manspreading|manspreading]] in a metro train.|alt=Man smiling]]\n\nThe video has several easter eggs alluding to Swift's other work, including ''[[Speak Now]]'', ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]'', ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' and ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' graffiti on a wall. ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'' is written backwards, while the title of her [[Taylor Swift (album)|eponymous debut album]] appears in a sign saying \"Missing: If Found Return to Taylor Swift\". The \"missing\" sign, along with another wordless sign that appears to ban riding [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]], references her battle with [[Scooter Braun]] and [[Big Machine Records]] over the ownership of the master recordings of her first six studio albums. ''Lover'', the first album that Swift completely owns herself, is absent, but the word \"karma\" is written twice on the wall, a possible reference to Swift's plan to re-record her previous works thus lowering the value of the originals. The camera subsequently pans over a \"Mr. Americana\" poster for a film starring Tyler Swift, directed by Larry Wilson, and premiering at the 2020 Mandance Festival, a [[word play]] on Swift's [[Netflix]] documentary ''[[Miss Americana]]'' directed by [[Lana Wilson]], which debuted at the [[2020 Sundance Film Festival]]. Swift's alter-ego runs down a hallway giving high-fives to nineteen disembodied hands, alluding to double standards behind the [[walk of shame]] that women are often forced to take after a sexual encounter. The hands are said to be a reference to the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th amendment of the United States constitution]], which granted women the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|right to vote]] in the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/eleanorbate/taylor-swift-the-man-music-video-hidden-details|title=Taylor Swift Just Unveiled Her Self-Directed Music Video For \"The Man\" And It's Full Of Hidden Details|last=Bate|first=Ellie|website=BuzzFeed|language=en|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref>\n\nIn the final scene, Swift herself appears as the video's director to instruct her male alter-ego to be both \"sexier\" and \"more likeable\" in the next take\u2014a subtle dig at the entertainment industry's blatant objectification of and sexist treatment toward women.

The song was serviced to US [[Hot adult contemporary|adult contemporary]] and [[Contemporary hit radio|pop]] radio formats on January 27 and 28, 2020 as the fourth single from Swift's seventh studio album, ''[[Lover (album)|Lover]]'' (2019)''.'' Swift wrote and produced the song with [[Joel Little]]. It is a [[synth-pop]] song which features flashy harmonies and murky synths. Over an uptempo production, Swift imagines the media's treatment of her if she were a man. The song received acclaim from critics, who praised its [[feminism|feminist]] message.\n\n\"The Man\" peaked at number 23 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming the fourth consecutive single from ''Lover'' to peak inside the top 40 of the chart. It also debuted at number 4 on the [[Rolling Stone Top 100|''Rolling Stone'' Top 100]]. It entered the top 40 on charts in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Ireland, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Slovakia and the United Kingdom. On February 7, 2020, an animated lyric video of the song was released on [[YouTube]]. On February 18, 2020, a live acoustic version of the song, titled \"The Man (Live from Paris)\", was released on all music platforms, accompanied by its live video. \n\nAn official music video for \"The Man\" was released on February 27, 2020 and was directed by Swift herself, marking her solo directorial debut. The [[Satire|satirical]] video sees Swift in her theoretical male alter-ego named \"Tyler Swift\", presenting several prevalent examples of double standards in society, including [[Sexual objectification|objectification]], [[Sexualization|sexualization of women]], [[toxic masculinity]] and [[patriarchy]].\n\n==Background and composition==\n[[File:Leonardo DiCaprio 2014.jpg|thumb|upright| American actor [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] is name-checked in the lyrics of the song, whose films, ''[[Inception]]'' and ''[[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|The Wolf of Wall Street]]'', are further referenced in its lyric video and music video, respectively.|alt=Leonardo DiCaprio attending a film premiere]]The recording process for [[Taylor Swift]]'s seventh studio album ''[[Lover (album)|Lover]]'' took under three months, and concluded in February 2019.<ref>{{cite web |last=Suskind |first=Alex |title=New Reputation: Taylor Swift shares intel on TS7, fan theories, and her next era |url=https://ew.com/music/2019/05/09/taylor-swift-cover-story/ |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=September 1, 2019 |date=May 9, 2019}}</ref> [[Joel Little]] was revealed as one of the producers for the album with the release of lead single \"[[Me!]]\" in April.

The video presents numerous prevalent examples of double standards in society, and comments on the [[Sexual objectification|objectification]] and [[Sexualization|sexualization of women]], [[toxic masculinity]], [[patriarchy]], as well as performative allyship. Throughout the video, the male version of Swift is seen rudely inconveniencing the people around him, leading a luxurious and promiscuous lifestyle, [[manspreading]], receiving praise for the bare minimum, and throwing [[Tantrum|tantrums]] without consequences. It contains visual references to ''[[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|The Wolf of Wall Street]]'', a film involving the lyrically name-checked actor [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and cinematographer Prieto, and tennis player [[Serena Williams]]' match controversy with a chair umpire at the [[2018 US Open (tennis)|2018 US Open Championships]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[File:Tyler Swift manspreading.jpeg|thumb|Swift's male alter-ego, Tyler Swift (in the middle), [[Manspreading|manspreading]] in a metro train.|alt=Man smiling]]\n\nThe video has several easter eggs alluding to Swift's other work, including ''[[Speak Now]]'', ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]'', ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' and ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' graffiti on a wall. ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'' is written backwards, while the title of her [[Taylor Swift (album)|eponymous debut album]] appears in a sign saying \"Missing: If Found Return to Taylor Swift\". The \"missing\" sign, along with another wordless sign that appears to ban riding [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]], references her battle with [[Scooter Braun]] and [[Big Machine Records]] over the ownership of the master recordings of her first six studio albums. ''Lover'', the first album that Swift completely owns herself, is absent, but the word \"karma\" is written twice on the wall, a possible reference to Swift's plan to re-record her previous works thus lowering the value of the originals. The camera subsequently pans over a \"Mr. Americana\" poster for a film starring Tyler Swift, directed by Larry Wilson, and premiering at the 2020 Mandance Festival, a [[word play]] on Swift's [[Netflix]] documentary ''[[Miss Americana]]'' directed by [[Lana Wilson]], which debuted at the [[2020 Sundance Film Festival]]. Swift's alter-ego runs down a hallway giving high-fives to nineteen disembodied hands, alluding to double standards behind the [[walk of shame]] that women are often forced to take after a sexual encounter. The hands are said to be a reference to the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th amendment of the United States constitution]], which granted women the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|right to vote]] in the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/eleanorbate/taylor-swift-the-man-music-video-hidden-details|title=Taylor Swift Just Unveiled Her Self-Directed Music Video For \"The Man\" And It's Full Of Hidden Details|last=Bate|first=Ellie|website=BuzzFeed|language=en|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref>\n\nIn the final scene, Swift herself appears as the video's director to instruct her male alter-ego to be both \"sexier\" and \"more likeable\" in the next take\u2014a subtle dig at the entertainment industry's blatant objectification of and sexist treatment toward women.

{"title_page": "Maurice Eustace (Lord Chancellor)", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n'''Sir Maurice Eustace''' (c. 1590 \u2013 22 June 1665) was an Irish politician, barrister and [[judge]] of the seventeenth century who spent the last years of his career as Lord Chancellor of Ireland. This was an office for which he felt himself to be entirely unfit,  and in which he was universally agreed to have been a failure.\n\n==Family background==\nEustace was born in about 1590, at [[Castlemartin House and Estate|Castlemartin]], [[County Kildare]], eldest of the three sons of John FitzWilliam Eustace, Constable of [[Naas]] (died 1623). Little is known of his mother, thought to be Catherine d'Arcy, or of his sisters, apart from the fact that one siste, whose name is variously given as Elizabeth or Eleanor, married Edmund Keating and was the mother of [[John Keating (judge)|John Keating]], [[Chief Justice of the Irish  Common Pleas]].  The Eustaces of Castlemartin were a branch of the prominent \"Old English\"  FitzEustace family who held the title [[Viscount Baltinglass]], but unlike their Baltinglass cousins the Castlemartin branch of the Eustace family played no part in the [[Desmond Rebellions]] of the 1580s, most of them being noted for their loyalty to the Crown. Maurice in time was to recover much of the property forfeited by his Baltinglass cousins, which remained in the family into the eighteenth century.<ref>O'Flanagan, J. Roderick ''Lives of the Lord Chancellors and Keepers of the Great Seal of Ireland''  2 volumes London 1870</ref> In matters of religion the family was divided in sympathy; the judge's granduncle, also named [[Maurice Eustace (priest)|Maurice Eustace]], was denounced to the authorities as a [[Jesuit]] in 1581, found guilty and executed. The judge himself, though a [[Protestant]], was exceptionally tolerant in matters of religion.\n\nA later Sir Maurice Eustace, first and last of the [[Eustace baronets]] of Castle Martin, belonged to the same branch of the family, being a grandson of one of the Chancellor's uncles: he should not be confused with a third Sir Maurice Eustace who was the Lord Chancellor's nephew, nor with the Lord Chancellor's natural son, who was yet another Maurice.\n\n[[Image:Castlemartin.jpg|thumb|Castlemartin House, the Eustace family seat,  present day]]\n\n==Early career==\nEustace attended the  [[University of Dublin]], and after graduating he became a [[Teaching fellow|fellow]] of the University,  and its lecturer in [[Hebrew]]; in his will he left a legacy to maintain a Hebrew lecture at Trinity.<ref>Webb, Alfred  ''A Compendium of Irish Biography''  1878</ref>  However he had set his heart on a legal career,  and after two years he resigned the fellowship and entered [[Lincoln's Inn]]. He was also determined on a career in politics,  and he had made a useful political contact through his father, who knew the Lord Deputy of Ireland, [[Oliver St John, 1st Viscount Grandison]].<ref>Ball, F. Elrington  ''The Judges in Ireland 1221\u20131921''  John Murray London 1926 pp. 271\u2013277</ref>\n\nHe spent some time in England after he was [[called to the Bar]],  but he was back in Dublin by 1630. He quickly built up an extremely lucrative legal practice; it was said he could \"earn forty gold pieces in a morning\".\n\nHe entered the [[Irish House of Commons]] in 1634 as member for [[Athy (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Athy]]. Unlike some of the \"Old English\", he was a whole-hearted supporter of the  powerful and formidable [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford]],  who in return praised Eustace as a man of integrity and ability, and [[knighted]]  him. He became [[Serjeant-at-law (Ireland)|Prime Serjeant]], then the senior Crown legal adviser. As Serjeant he acted as an extra justice of [[assize]] in 1637,<ref>Hart, A. R. ''History of the King's Serjeants-at-law in Ireland''   Dublin Four Courts Press 2000 pp.50-51</ref> at the request of Wentworth, who wished to curb the ambition of the rising barrister [[Jerome Alexander]], who had  hoped to gain preferment by acting as an assize judge, but whom Wentworth detested.<ref>Hart pp.50-51</ref>  In 1640 Maurice was re-elected to the Commons as member for [[Kildare County (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|County Kildare]] and became [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the House. His formal speech of welcome to Wentworth at the opening of the 1640 Parliament is considered to be a good example of his ornate style of oratory, which was much admired at the time:\n\n''\n\"Welcome, most worthy Lord, to the new birth of this our Parliament; this is the voice of the House of Commons, and I am sure it is the voice of the whole assembly; it is beside [[Vox Populi]] abroad, and I am sure it is [[Voice of God|Vox Dei]]\".<ref>Wedgwood C.V. ''Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford- a Revaluation'' Phoenix Press reissue 2000 p. 276</ref>\n\nUnlike many of Strafford's political allies, he did not suffer politically as a result of Strafford's [[impeachment]] and execution in 1641. Although the \"Old English\" gentry had come to detest Strafford as much as the \"New English\" settlers did,  Eustace was one of their own, and was generally liked and respected. He remained Speaker of the Commons until 1647; at its final meeting the House voiced its thanks for \"the many good services performed by Sir Maurice Eustace their Speaker\", and spoke ominously of the \"inveterate hatred and malice of the detestable rebels\" against him.<ref>Webb ''Compendium of Irish Biography''</ref>\n\n[[File:Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford by Sir Anthony Van Dyck (2).jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford]], attributed to Sir [[Anthony Van Dyck]].]]\n\n==Civil War==\nSo long as Dublin remained under Royalist control, Eustace prospered, despite his frequent complaints about the invasion of his property, the despoiling of his woods and the theft of his [[cattle]]. He recovered the old family manor of [[Palmerstown]],   which had passed,  after the Baltinglass branch of the family suffered  forfeiture of their estates,  to  the Allen family.<ref>Ball, F. Elrington  ''History of Dublin'' 6 Volumes Alexander Thom and Co Dublin 1906-1920</ref> In 1643, being known as a man who had some sympathy for the plight of Irish Roman Catholics, he was sent to negotiate with the [[Irish Confederacy]] at [[Kilkenny]]. He obtained the reversion to the office of [[Master of the Rolls in Ireland]], and acquired land at Athy and [[Cong, County Mayo|Cong]]. In 1647, however, the [[Marquis of Ormonde]] surrendered Dublin to the Parliamentary forces. Eustace was arrested soon afterwards and sent to [[Chester Castle]] where he remained for seven years. His confinement cannot have been very strict,  as he formed an extra-marital relationship  with a lady whose name is mot kmown which produced two children. He and his children's mother, who is said to have been a lady of some social standing,  were still on friendly terms in the 1660s.<ref>Ball 1926 p. 274</ref>\n\nOn his release he returned to Dublin. He was re-arrested, and briefly imprisoned,  on suspicion of corresponding with [[Charles II of England|Charles II]],  but was quickly released and allowed to resume practice at the Bar. His loyalty to the [[Stuart dynasty]] was never in serious doubt, and it is likely that he was kept under some degree of [[surveillance]]. At the same time he enjoyed the goodwill of [[Henry Cromwell]], who spoke of him as an eminent lawyer  \"to whom I am beholden and owe a kindness\". Precisely what service Eustace had performed for Cromwell is unclear.<ref>Ball  ''History of Dublin''</ref>\n\n==Restoration==\n{{main|Restoration (Ireland)}}\nAt the Restoration, Eustace's unquestioned loyalty to the Crown,  combined with his legal and political experience,  made him on the face of it a man who was ideally suited to high office; in addition he was personally close to the Duke of Ormonde, who would do anything to help a friend.<ref>Ball 1926 p. 276</ref>  Accordingly, he was appointed [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]] and a [[Lord Justice of Ireland]], exercising the powers of the Lord Lieutenant in his absence, jointly with [[Charles Coote, 1st Earl of Mountrath]] and [[Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery]]. He accepted a [[peerage]], but later changed his mind, presumably because he had no legitimate son to inherit it.\n\nIronically the only serious objection to his appointment came from Eustace himself.<ref>Ball ''History of Dublin''</ref> He was increasingly drawn to a country life, and had looked forward to his retirement to his beloved country seat Harristown Castle,  which he was rebuilding after the damage it had suffered during the Civil War, and which by the time of his death was considered to be one of the finest houses in Ireland.<ref>Webb ''Compendium of Irish Biography''</ref> Also he honestly doubted if his age and ill-health fitted him for high office. He wrote pathetically to the Secretary of State:\n\n\"'' I.... am now grown too old to perform any public service. I desire no such post nor any favour except to remain in his Majesty's good opinion. I hope I shall not now be put beyond my strength with any public employment \"<ref>Ball 1926 p. 272</ref>\n''\n\n== Lord Justice of Ireland ==\nAs Lord Justice, Eustace was embroiled in the bitter disputes (which led to passing of the [[Act of Settlement 1662]])  between the mainly Roman Catholic Royalists who had been dispossessed in the [[Cromwellian Settlement]] of 1652,  and the newcomers who had bought their estates. Eustace by birth was a member of the dispossessed class and identified himself entirely with its interests; and though he was himself a Protestant he believed firmly in equal rights for Roman Catholics.

This was an office for which he felt himself to be entirely unfit,  and in which he was universally agreed to have been a failure.\n\n==Family background==\nEustace was born in about 1590, at [[Castlemartin House and Estate|Castlemartin]], [[County Kildare]], eldest of the three sons of John FitzWilliam Eustace, Constable of [[Naas]] (died 1623). Little is known of his mother, thought to be Catherine d'Arcy, or of his sisters, apart from the fact that one siste, whose name is variously given as Elizabeth or Eleanor, married Edmund Keating and was the mother of [[John Keating (judge)|John Keating]], [[Chief Justice of the Irish  Common Pleas]].  The Eustaces of Castlemartin were a branch of the prominent \"Old English\"  FitzEustace family who held the title [[Viscount Baltinglass]], but unlike their Baltinglass cousins the Castlemartin branch of the Eustace family played no part in the [[Desmond Rebellions]] of the 1580s, most of them being noted for their loyalty to the Crown. Maurice in time was to recover much of the property forfeited by his Baltinglass cousins, which remained in the family into the eighteenth century.<ref>O'Flanagan, J. Roderick ''Lives of the Lord Chancellors and Keepers of the Great Seal of Ireland''  2 volumes London 1870</ref> In matters of religion the family was divided in sympathy; the judge's granduncle, also named [[Maurice Eustace (priest)|Maurice Eustace]], was denounced to the authorities as a [[Jesuit]] in 1581, found guilty and executed. The judge himself, though a [[Protestant]], was exceptionally tolerant in matters of religion.\n\nA later Sir Maurice Eustace, first and last of the [[Eustace baronets]] of Castle Martin, belonged to the same branch of the family, being a grandson of one of the Chancellor's uncles: he should not be confused with a third Sir Maurice Eustace who was the Lord Chancellor's nephew, nor with the Lord Chancellor's natural son, who was yet another Maurice.\n\n[[Image:Castlemartin.jpg|thumb|Castlemartin House, the Eustace family seat,  present day]]\n\n==Early career==\nEustace attended the  [[University of Dublin]], and after graduating he became a [[Teaching fellow|fellow]] of the University,  and its lecturer in [[Hebrew]]; in his will he left a legacy to maintain a Hebrew lecture at Trinity.<ref>Webb, Alfred  ''A Compendium of Irish Biography''  1878</ref>  However he had set his heart on a legal career,  and after two years he resigned the fellowship and entered [[Lincoln's Inn]]. He was also determined on a career in politics,  and he had made a useful political contact through his father, who knew the Lord Deputy of Ireland, [[Oliver St John, 1st Viscount Grandison]].<ref>Ball, F. Elrington  ''The Judges in Ireland 1221\u20131921''  John Murray London 1926 pp. 271\u2013277</ref>\n\nHe spent some time in England after he was [[called to the Bar]],  but he was back in Dublin by 1630. He quickly built up an extremely lucrative legal practice; it was said he could \"earn forty gold pieces in a morning\".\n\nHe entered the [[Irish House of Commons]] in 1634 as member for [[Athy (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Athy]]. Unlike some of the \"Old English\", he was a whole-hearted supporter of the  powerful and formidable [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford]],  who in return praised Eustace as a man of integrity and ability, and [[knighted]]  him. He became [[Serjeant-at-law (Ireland)|Prime Serjeant]], then the senior Crown legal adviser. As Serjeant he acted as an extra justice of [[assize]] in 1637,<ref>Hart, A. R. ''History of the King's Serjeants-at-law in Ireland''   Dublin Four Courts Press 2000 pp.50-51</ref> at the request of Wentworth, who wished to curb the ambition of the rising barrister [[Jerome Alexander]], who had  hoped to gain preferment by acting as an assize judge, but whom Wentworth detested.<ref>Hart pp.50-51</ref>  In 1640 Maurice was re-elected to the Commons for [[Kildare County (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|County Kildare]] and became [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the House. His formal speech of welcome to Wentworth at the opening of the 1640 Parliament is considered to be a good example of his ornate style of oratory, which was much admired at the time:\n\n''\n\"Welcome, most worthy Lord, to the new birth of this our Parliament; this is the voice of the House of Commons, and I am sure it is the voice of the whole assembly; it is beside [[Vox Populi]] abroad, and I am sure it is [[Voice of God|Vox Dei]]\".<ref>Wedgwood C.V. ''Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford- a Revaluation'' Phoenix Press reissue 2000 p. 276</ref>\n\nUnlike many of Strafford's political allies, he did not suffer politically as a result of Strafford's [[impeachment]] and execution in 1641. Although the \"Old English\" gentry had come to detest Strafford as much as the \"New English\" settlers did,  Eustace was one of their own, and was generally liked and respected. He remained Speaker of the Commons until 1647; at its final meeting the House voiced its thanks for \"the many good services performed by Sir Maurice Eustace their Speaker\", and spoke ominously of the \"inveterate hatred and malice of the detestable rebels\" against him.<ref>Webb ''Compendium of Irish Biography''</ref>\n\n[[File:Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford by Sir Anthony Van Dyck (2).jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford]], attributed to Sir [[Anthony Van Dyck]].]]\n\n==Civil War==\nSo long as Dublin remained under Royalist control, Eustace prospered, despite his frequent complaints about the invasion of his property, the despoiling of his woods and the theft of his [[cattle]]. He recovered the old family manor of [[Palmerstown]],   which had passed,  after the Baltinglass branch of the family suffered  forfeiture of their estates,  to  the Allen family.<ref>Ball, F. Elrington  ''History of Dublin'' 6 Volumes Alexander Thom and Co Dublin 1906-1920</ref> In 1643, being known as a man who had some sympathy for the plight of Irish Roman Catholics, he was sent to negotiate with the [[Irish Confederacy]] at [[Kilkenny]]. He obtained the reversion to the office of [[Master of the Rolls in Ireland]], and acquired land at Athy and [[Cong, County Mayo|Cong]]. In 1647, however, the [[Marquis of Ormonde]] surrendered Dublin to the Parliamentary forces. Eustace was arrested soon afterwards and sent to [[Chester Castle]] where he remained for seven years. His confinement cannot have been very strict,  as he formed an extra-marital relationship  with a lady whose name is mot kmown which produced two children. He and his children's mother, who is said to have been a lady of some social standing,  were still on friendly terms in the 1660s.<ref>Ball 1926 p. 274</ref>\n\nOn his release he returned to Dublin. He was re-arrested, and briefly imprisoned,  on suspicion of corresponding with [[Charles II of England|Charles II]],  but was quickly released and allowed to resume practice at the Bar. His loyalty to the [[Stuart dynasty]] was never in serious doubt, and it is likely that he was kept under some degree of [[surveillance]]. At the same time he enjoyed the goodwill of [[Henry Cromwell]], who spoke of him as an eminent lawyer  \"to whom I am beholden and owe a kindness\". Precisely what service Eustace had performed for Cromwell is unclear.<ref>Ball  ''History of Dublin''</ref>\n\n==Restoration==\n{{main|Restoration (Ireland)}}\nAt the Restoration, Eustace's unquestioned loyalty to the Crown,  combined with his legal and political experience,  made him on the face of it a man who was ideally suited to high office; in addition he was personally close to the Duke of Ormonde, who would do anything to help a friend.<ref>Ball 1926 p. 276</ref>  Accordingly, he was appointed [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]] and a [[Lord Justice of Ireland]], exercising the powers of the Lord Lieutenant in his absence, jointly with [[Charles Coote, 1st Earl of Mountrath]] and [[Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery]]. He accepted a [[peerage]], but later changed his mind, presumably because he had no legitimate son to inherit it.\n\nIronically the only serious objection to his appointment came from Eustace himself.<ref>Ball ''History of Dublin''</ref> He was increasingly drawn to a country life, and had looked forward to his retirement to his beloved country seat Harristown Castle,  which he was rebuilding after the damage it had suffered during the Civil War, and which by the time of his death was considered to be one of the finest houses in Ireland.<ref>Webb ''Compendium of Irish Biography''</ref> Also he honestly doubted if his age and ill-health fitted him for high office. He wrote pathetically to the Secretary of State:\n\n\"'' I.... am now grown too old to perform any public service. I desire no such post nor any favour except to remain in his Majesty's good opinion. I hope I shall not now be put beyond my strength with any public employment \"<ref>Ball 1926 p. 272</ref>\n''\n\n== Lord Justice of Ireland ==\nAs Lord Justice, Eustace was embroiled in the bitter disputes (which led to passing of the [[Act of Settlement 1662]])  between the mainly Roman Catholic Royalists who had been dispossessed in the [[Cromwellian Settlement]] of 1652,  and the newcomers who had bought their estates. Eustace by birth was a member of the dispossessed class and identified himself entirely with its interests; and though he was himself a Protestant he believed firmly in equal rights for Roman Catholics. This put him at odds with his fellow Lords Justices, Mountrath  (until his death at the end of 1661) and Orrery: they were firm supporters of the Cromwellians, whom Eustace regarded as criminals, and in his view  they were both  implacably hostile to the Catholics.<ref>O'Flanagan ''Lives of the Lord Chancellors'', above</ref> In his private correspondence with Ormonde, he denounced his fellow Lords Justices with such venom that Ormonde in reply urged him to show more discretion.<ref>Ball 1926 p. 273</ref>  Eustace did obtain some concessions for the Royalists in the Act of Settlement, but the struggle exhausted him and he was thankful when [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde|Ormonde's]] arrival in Dublin in 1662 allowed him to resign as Lord Justice.
