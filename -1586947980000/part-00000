They ascribe Phoenicianism to [[sectarian]] influences on Lebanese culture and the attempt by Lebanese Maronites to distance themselves from Arab culture and traditions.\n\nThe counter position is summed by As'ad AbuKhalil, ''Historical Dictionary of Lebanon'' (London: Scarecrow Press), 1998:\n[[File:Lebanon archaeology.jpg|thumb|200x200px|[[Phoenicians|Phoenician]] sites in the [[Beirut|Central District of Beirut]].]]\n<blockquote>Ethnically speaking, the Lebanese are indistinguishable from the peoples of the eastern Mediterranean. They are undoubtedly a mixed population, reflecting centuries of population movement and foreign occupation... While Arabness is not an ethnicity but a cultural identity, some ardent Arab nationalists, in Lebanon and elsewhere, talk about Arabness in racial and ethnic terms to elevate the descendants of [[Muhammad]]. Paradoxically, Lebanese nationalists also speak about the Lebanese people in racial terms, claiming that the Lebanese are \"pure\" descendants of the Phoenician peoples, whom they view as separate from the ancient residents of the region, including \u2014 ironically \u2014 the Canaanites. </blockquote>\n\nProponents of Phoenician continuity among [[Maronite Christians]] point out that a Phoenician identity, including the worship of pre-Christian Phoenician gods such as [[Baal]], [[El (deity)|El]], [[Astarte]] and [[Adon]] was still in evidence until the mid 4th century AD, and was only gradually replaced by Christianity during the 4th and 5th centuries AD.

Salibi, \"The Lebanese Identity\" ''Journal of Contemporary History'' '''6'''.1, Nationalism and Separatism (1971:76-86).</ref> The first coherent history of [[Mount Lebanon]] was written by [[Tannus al-Shidyaq]] (died 1861) who depicted the country as a feudal association of Maronites, [[Druze]]s, [[Melkite Christianity in Lebanon|Melkites]], [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunnis]] and [[Shia Islam in Lebanon|Shi'ite]]s under the leadership of the [[Chehab family|Shihab emirs]]. \"Most Christian Lebanese, anxious to dissociate themselves from Arabism and its Islamic connections, were pleased to be told that their country was the legitimate heir to the [[Phoenicia]]n tradition,\" Kamal Salibi observes, instancing Christian writers like [[Charles Corm]] (died 1963), writing in French, and [[Said Aql]], who urged the abandonment of [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]], together with its script, and attempted to write in the Lebanese vernacular, using the Roman alphabet.\n\nPhoenician origins have additional appeal for the Christian [[middle class]], as it presents the Phoenicians as traders, and the Lebanese emigrant as a modern-day Phoenician adventurer, whereas for the Sunni it merely veiled French imperialist ambitions, intent on subverting [[pan-Arabism]].<ref>Salibi 1971:84.</ref>\n\nCritics believe that Phoenicianism is an [[origin myth]] that disregards the Arab cultural and linguistic influence on the Lebanese. They ascribe Phoenicianism to [[sectarian]] influences on Lebanese culture and the attempt by Lebanese Maronites to distance themselves from Arab culture and traditions.\n\nThe counter position is summed by As'ad AbuKhalil, ''Historical Dictionary of Lebanon'' (London: Scarecrow Press), 1998:\n[[File:Lebanon archaeology.jpg|thumb|200x200px|[[Phoenicians|Phoenician]] sites in the [[Beirut|Central District of Beirut]].]]\n<blockquote>Ethnically speaking, the Lebanese are indistinguishable from the peoples of the eastern Mediterranean. They are undoubtedly a mixed population, reflecting centuries of population movement and foreign occupation... While Arabness is not an ethnicity but a cultural identity, some ardent Arab nationalists, in Lebanon and elsewhere, talk about Arabness in racial and ethnic terms to elevate the descendants of [[Muhammad]]. Paradoxically, Lebanese nationalists also speak about the Lebanese people in racial terms, claiming that the Lebanese are \"pure\" descendants of the Phoenician peoples, whom they view as separate from the ancient residents of the region, including \u2014 ironically \u2014 the Canaanites. </blockquote>\n\nProponents of Phoenician continuity among [[Maronite Christians]] point out that a Phoenician identity, including the worship of pre-Christian Phoenician gods such as [[Baal]], [[El (deity)|El]], [[Astarte]] and [[Adon]] was still in evidence until the mid 4th century AD, and was only gradually replaced by Christianity during the 4th and 5th centuries AD.

As of 2015, he uses the Pro Staff RF97 Autograph model that is heavy (340 g/12 oz unstrung) and larger (97 sq. in.). Jim Courier and Stefan Edberg also used the Pro Staff Original, Edberg later switching to the Pro Staff Classic in 1991, which was the same racket (85 sq. in. with slightly rounded frame edges) but with different paint work. In late 2009, Wilson unveiled their latest line of rackets, codenamed 20x, which they would later rename BLX. This line directly replaces their previous K-Factor series with all new technologies.<ref>[https://cuzgeek.com/best-badminton-rackets/ Latest Wilson Rackets - CuzGeek]</ref> Also, many pros use custom-made rackets that perform differently from the mass-produced versions.\n\nAside from tennis rackets, the Wilson sporting goods company also makes [[tennis balls]] (including the official balls of the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] and starting in 2020, the [[French Open]] major championships), shoes, balls, strings, clothes, and racquet bags.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.wilson.com/en-us/tennis/| title=Wilson Tennis Rackets, Equipment and Accessories| website=Wilson}}</ref>\n\n==Tennis Racquets==\n\n{{Advert section|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Clash===\n\nThis racquet is often known as the revolutionary racquet, as it produces spin, power, and control.

The company designs and manufactures a full range of [[golf equipment]], accessories and clothing using the Wilson Staff, ProStaff and Ultra [[brand]]s.\n\nMany of the worlds top [[professional golfer]]s have used Wilson equipment including [[Nick Faldo]], [[Arnold Palmer]] and [[Ben Crenshaw]]; the latter two of whom used Wilson 8802 putters. Crenshaw's even received the moniker ''Little Ben'' due to his proficiency with it{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}. Current Wilson Staff players include [[The Open Championship|British Open]] and [[PGA Championship]] champion [[P\u00e1draig Harrington]], and [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] champion [[Gary Woodland]].\n\n===Tennis===\n[[File:Roger Federer (26 June 2009, Wimbledon) 2 new.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Roger Federer]] used Wilson racquet in [[2009 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles|Wimbledon]] 2009]]\nWilson is a major manufacturer of tennis rackets. The original [[kevlar]] [[Wilson ProStaff Original 6.0|Pro Staff]] model racket, known for its use by [[Pete Sampras]], was heavy (more than 350g strung) and small-headed (85 sq. in.); Roger Federer also used the same racket model. As of 2015, he uses the Pro Staff RF97 Autograph model that is heavy (340 g/12 oz unstrung) and larger (97 sq. in.). Jim Courier and Stefan Edberg also used the Pro Staff Original, Edberg later switching to the Pro Staff Classic in 1991, which was the same racket (85 sq. in. with slightly rounded frame edges) but with different paint work. In late 2009, Wilson unveiled their latest line of rackets, codenamed 20x, which they would later rename BLX. This line directly replaces their previous K-Factor series with all new technologies.<ref>[https://cuzgeek.com/best-badminton-rackets/ Latest Wilson Rackets - CuzGeek]</ref> Also, many pros use custom-made rackets that perform differently from the mass-produced versions.\n\nAside from tennis rackets, the Wilson sporting goods company also makes [[tennis balls]] (including the official balls of the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] and starting in 2020, the [[French Open]] major championships), shoes, balls, strings, clothes, and racquet bags.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.wilson.com/en-us/tennis/| title=Wilson Tennis Rackets, Equipment and Accessories| website=Wilson}}</ref>\n\n==Tennis Racquets==\n\n{{Advert section|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Clash===\n\nThis racquet is often known as the revolutionary racquet, as it produces spin, power, and control. This racquet is the first one to include FreeFlex, which is another racquet technology service that allows players to swing at any angle and still be able to produce a quality shot.\n\n===Blade===\n\nThis racquet is for the attackers who need a lot of feel. This racquet is heavily used in the ATP and WTA.\n\n===Pro Staff===\n\nThis line of racquets is for players who benefit from control. Mainly targeted towards attackers. There is a variation to this racquet called the Roger Federer 97, or RF97.\n\n===Ultra===\n\nThis line gives you spin and power. Suitable for all-court players.\n\n===Burn===\n\nThis line is no longer being produced as much as before, because it mainly has been replaced by '''Clash'''. This racquet is for the heavy baseliner and gives you tons of power.\n\n\n====Male players==== \n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* {{Flag icon|SUI}} [[Roger Federer]]\n* {{Flag icon|ARG}} [[Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro]]\n* {{Flag icon|ARG}} [[Agust\u00edn Velotti]]\n* {{Flag icon|AUS}} [[Alex De Minaur]]\n* {{Flag icon|BEL}} [[David Goffin]]\n* {{Flag icon|Belarus}} [[Max Mirnyi]]\n* {{Flag icon|BUL}} [[Grigor Dimitrov]]\n* {{Flag icon|BRA}} [[Thomaz Bellucci]]\n* {{Flag icon|BRA}} [[Guilherme Clezar]]\n* {{Flag icon|BIH}} [[Damir Dzumhur]]\n* {{Flag icon|CAN}} [[Frank Dancevic]]\n* {{Flag icon|CAN}} [[Daniel Nestor]]\n* {{Flag icon|CAN}} [[Milos Raonic]]\n* {{Flag icon|CAN}} [[Vasek Pospisil]]\n* {{Flag icon|CHI}} [[Nicol\u00e1s Jarry|Nicolas Jarry]]\n* {{Flag icon|CRO}} [[Borna Coric]]\n* {{Flag icon|CRO}} [[Mate Pavic]]\n* {{Flag icon|ESP}} [[Feliciano L\u00f3pez]]\n* {{Flag icon|ESP}} [[Roberto Bautista Agut]]\n* {{Flag icon|ESP}} [[Pablo Carreno Busta]]\n* {{Flag icon|FRA}} [[Ga\u00ebl Monfils]]\n* {{Flag icon|FRA}} [[Nicolas Mahut]]\n* {{Flag icon|GRB}} [[Kyle Edmund]]\n* {{Flag icon|GER}} [[Philipp Kohlschreiber]]\n* {{Flag icon|GER}} [[Philipp Petzschner]]\n* {{Flag icon|GRE}} [[Stefanos Tsitsipas]]\n* {{Flag icon|JPN}} [[Kei Nishikori]]\n* {{Flag icon|LAT}} [[Ernests Gulbis]]\n* {{Flag icon|PAK}} [[Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi]]\n* {{Flag icon|ROM}} [[Horia Tec\u0103u]]\n* {{Flag icon|ROM}} [[Adrian Ungur]]\n* {{Flag icon|RUS}} [[Karen Khachanov]]\n* {{Flag icon|RUS}} [[Andrey Rublev (tennis)| Andrey Rublev]]\n* {{Flag icon|UKR}} [[Alexandr Dolgopolov]]\n* {{Flag icon|India}} [[Mahesh Bhupathi]]\n* {{Flag icon|SWE}} [[Daniel Berta]]\n* {{Flag icon|SWE}} [[Robert Lindstedt]]\n* {{Flag icon|TUR}} [[Marsel \u0130lhan]]\n* {{Flag icon|Finland}} [[Henri Kontinen]]\n* {{Flag icon|SRB}} [[Ilija Bozoljac]]\n* {{Flag icon|SRB}} [[Nenad Zimonjic]]\n* {{Flag icon|SRB}} [[Filip Krajinovi\u0107]]\n* {{Flag icon|SRB}} [[Dusan Lajovic]]\n* {{Flag icon|USA}} [[Reilly Opelka]]\n* {{Flag icon|POR}} [[Jo\u00e3o Sousa]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n====Female players====\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* {{Flag icon|USA}} [[Serena Williams]]\n* {{Flag icon|USA}} [[Venus Williams]]\n* {{Flag icon|Australia}} [[Anastasia Rodionova]]\n* {{Flag icon|Belarus}} [[Victoria Azarenka]]\n* {{Flag icon|Belarus}} [[Olga Govortsova]]\n* {{Flag icon|Belarus}} [[Aryna Sabalenka]]\n* {{Flag icon|Czech Republic}} [[Petra Kvitov\u00e1]]\n* {{Flagicon|CZE}} [[Lucie \u0160af\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1]]\n* {{Flag icon|Czech Republic}} [[Barbora Z\u00e1hlavov\u00e1-Str\u00fdcov\u00e1]]\n* {{Flag icon|ROU}} [[Simona Halep]]\n* {{Flag icon|Croatia}} [[Ajla Tomljanovi\u0107]]\n* {{Flag icon|GBR}} [[Laura Robson]]\n* {{Flag icon|FRA}} [[Kristina Mladenovic]]\n* {{Flag icon|GER}} [[Andrea Petkovic]]\n*{{Flag icon|EST}} [[Kaia Kanepi]]\n* {{Flag icon|NZL}} [[Marina Erakovic]]\n* {{Flag icon|ROU}} [[Alexandra Cadan\u021bu]]\n* {{Flag icon|ROU}} [[Monica Niculescu]]\n* {{Flag icon|RUS}} [[Ekaterina Makarova]]\n* {{Flag icon|RUS}} [[Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova]]\n* {{Flag icon|RUS}} [[Vera Zvonareva]]\n* {{Flag icon|SLO}} [[Polona Hercog]]\n* {{Flag icon|UKR}} [[Elina Svitolina]]\n* {{Flag icon|USA}} [[Jamie Hampton]]\n* {{Flag icon|USA}} [[Madison Keys]]\n* {{Flag icon|USA}} [[Nicole Gibbs]]\n* {{Flag icon|GRE}} [[Maria Sakkari]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n====Former players====\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* {{Flag icon|ARG}} [[Gast\u00f3n Gaudio]]\n* {{Flag icon|BEL}} [[Justine Henin]]\n* {{Flag icon|GER}} [[Steffi Graf]]\n* {{Flag icon|SWE}} [[Stefan Edberg]]\n* {{Flag icon|USA}} [[Taylor Dent]]\n* {{Flag icon|USA}} [[Jimmy Connors]]\n* {{Flag icon|USA}} [[Chris Evert]]\n* {{Flag icon|USA}} [[Pete Sampras]]\n* {{Flag icon|USA}} [[Jack Kramer]]\n* {{Flag icon|USA}} [[Jim Courier]]\n* {{Flag icon|ARG}} [[Guillermo Ca\u00f1as]]\n* {{Flag icon|Finland}} [[Jarkko Nieminen]]\n* {{Flag icon|GBR}} [[Mark Farrell (tennis)|Mark Farrell]]\n* {{Flag icon|FRA}} [[Micha\u00ebl Llodra]]\n* {{Flag icon|GER}} [[Michael Berrer]]\n* {{Flag icon|Israel}} [[Andy Ram]]\n* {{Flag icon|USA}} [[Mardy Fish]]\n* {{Flag icon|FRA}} [[Paul-Henri Mathieu]]\n* {{Flag icon|AUS}} [[Jarmila Gajdo\u0161ov\u00e1]]\n* {{Flag icon|USA}} [[Melanie Oudin]]\n* {{Flag icon|ROU}} [[M\u0103d\u0103lina Gojnea]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Squash===\n\n====Active players====\n\n* {{flagicon|ENG}}  [[Peter Barker]]\n* {{flagicon|SUI}}  [[Nicolas M\u00fcller (squash player)|Nicolas M\u00fcller]]\n* {{flagicon|ENG}}  [[Tom Richards (squash player)|Tom Richards]]\n* {{flagicon|NZL}}  [[Campbell Grayson]]\n\n====Former players====\n* {{flagicon|AUS}}  [[Anthony Ricketts]]\n* {{flagicon|NZL}}  [[Jaclyn Hawkes]]\n* {{flagicon|FRA}}  [[Isabelle Stoehr]]\n\n===Volleyball===\n\n====Associations====\n* {{Flag icon|USA}} [[Association of Volleyball Professionals|AVP]] \u2013 Official ball\n\n==In popular culture==\nA Wilson [[volleyball (ball)|volleyball]] \"co-starred\" alongside [[Tom Hanks]] in the film ''[[Cast Away]]''.

They would upset Team SoloMid (3-1) and Team EnVyUs (3-2) to secure second place in the NA Smite Super Regionals 2015, losing to Cloud9 G2A, but qualifying for the SWC.\n\nThe same team would go on to upset FNATIC and Paradigm to move onto the finals of the SWC, falling to Epsilon eSports.

Only a couple weeks later, Masked, Vetium, and saltmachine (then known as Benj1) would leave Enemy for Denial eSports, and captain PainDeViande brought on three rookies, Maksim \"PandaCat\" Yanevich (who he had previously played with on Legion of Carrots), Lucas \"Varizial\" Spracklin, and Travis \"Marauder\" Navarro, for the SPL Spring Split of Season 3. Defying all odds, the team would go on to upset the entire league, taking first place and qualifying for Dreamhack Masters 2016.\n\nAt Dreamhack, they would defeat Kaos Latin Gamers before losing to Soar G2A in the semi-finals.\n\nIn the off-season, they would participate in the Epsilon Invitational, drawing with Paradigm in the group stage, before winning a tiebreaker and facing a rematch with Panthera (formerly Epsilon, now NRG). They would take 2 games off of the world champions, but lose in the end. Lucas \"Varizial\" Spracklin would change his name to \"Shatt3red\" going into the event.\n\nIn the Fall Split of Season 3, PandaCat was forced to go to Ukraine for vacation as a family tradition, so Jonathan \"Fearno\" King substituted for him in the online events. PandaCat returned to North America in the final week of online events, however, unlike previous splits, Enemy was not a top team, placing seventh of eight in online events.

XM655 initially flew with 9 Squadron, and was also operated by Nos. 44, 50 and 101 Squadrons. In 1984, XM655 was sold off to Roy Jacobsen who intended to keep her airworthy, but the costs proved prohibitive and also the runway was too short for it to take off, and XM655 was left to deteriorate. Title of XM655 then passed onto John Littler, owner of Wellesbourne Mountford Airfield, who intended to get her to a taxiable condition, but not airworthy. As well as MaPS maintaining it, the 150 City of Oxford Air Cadets helps to maintain it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} After restoration work, XM655 made her first public taxi run on 16 February 1997, with another two runs later that year. Since then, XM655 has made more or less annual public taxi runs, usually in June, as part of the Wellesbourne Wings and Wheels show. At various of these events, the display of XM655 has been accompanied by flypasts by the [[BBMF]], the [[Red Arrows]] and Vulcan XH558.

XM655 initially flew with 9 Squadron, and was also operated by Nos. 44, 50 and 101 Squadrons. In 1984, XM655 was sold off to Roy Jacobsen who intended to keep her airworthy, but the costs proved prohibitive and also the runway was too short for it to take off, and XM655 was left to deteriorate. Title of XM655 then passed onto John Littler, owner of Wellesbourne Mountford Airfield, who intended to get her to a taxiable condition, but not airworthy. As well as MaPS maintaining it, the 150 City of Oxford Air Cadets helps to maintain it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} After restoration work, XM655 made her first public taxi run on 16 February 1997, with another two runs later that year. Since then, XM655 has made more or less annual public taxi runs, usually in June, as part of the Wellesbourne Wings and Wheels show. At various of these events, the display of XM655 has been accompanied by flypasts by the [[BBMF]], the [[Red Arrows]] and Vulcan XH558. XM655 was also used by the crews of XH558 as required for currency and ground training.<ref>[http://www.xm655.com/history.php \"XM655 History.\"] ''xm655.com'', 3 September 2008.</ref>\n|<small>[[File:Avro 698 Vulcan B2, UK - Air Force AN2253959.jpg|frameless|100x100px]]</small>\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of surviving military aircraft|Avro Vulcan]]\n[[Category:Avro Vulcan]]\n", "name_user": "Hammersfan", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_surviving_Avro_Vulcans"}

A related term, {{math|''p''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, is the ratio {{math|''Q''<sub>''k''</sub> ''/'' ''Q''<sub>''total''</sub>}}, which describes the fractional energy released. The term {{math|&kappa;<sub>1</sub>}} is the variance in natural time:<ref>Varotsos, Sarlis & Skordas 2011 (book), pages 121 & 131</ref>\n\n: <math>\\kappa_1=\\sum_{k=1}^N p_k(\\chi_k)^2 - \\bigl(\\sum_{k=1}^N p_k\\chi_k\\bigr)^2</math>\n\n: where <math>\\textstyle\\chi_k=k/N</math> and <math>\\textstyle\\ p_k=\\frac{Q_k}{\\sum_{n=1}^N Q_n}</math>\n\n== Time reversal ==\nTime reversal, in contrast to clock time, is applicable when studying the approach of a system to criticality with natural time analysis. Living systems for example are considered to operate far from [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]] as there is flow of energy crossing their boundaries, in contrast to deseased organisms where inner driving forces are absent. While time irreversibility is a fundamental property of a living system, the state of death is more time reversible by means of energy flow across the system's boundaries. Thus a critical state of a system can be estimated by applying natural time analysis upon calculating the entropy upon both normal time flow and time reversal and studying the difference of two results.<ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":0\" />[[File:Natural time as applied in cardiology.jpg|thumb|(a) [[Electrocardiography|ECG]] in which the RR distances are marked<br />\n(b) the same ECG plotted in (a) but read in natural time analysis<br />\n(c) ECG at conventional time upon time reversal<br />\n(d) ECG upon time reversal in natural time analysis<br />\nThe length between RR distances in conventional time is aproximately considered as the energy of each pulse (event) in natural time analysis.|400px|alt=|center]]\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Seismology ===\n\n==== Earthquake nowcasting ====\nIn seismology, nowcasting is the estimate of the current dynamic state of a seismological system.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> It differs from forecasting which aims to estimate the probability of a future event<ref name=\":5\" /> but it is also considered a potential base for forecasting.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> Nowcasting is based on the [[earthquake cycle]] model, a recurring cycle between pairs of large earthquakes in a geographical area, upon which the system is evaluated using natural time analysis.<ref name=\":1\" /> Nowcasting calculations produce the \"earthquake potential score\", an estimation of the current level of seismic progress.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nWhen applied to seismicity, natural time analysis has the following advantages:<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n# Declustering of the aftershocks is not necessary as natural time count is evenly valid in any case of aftershock or backgroung seismicity.\n# Natural time statistics do not depend on the level of seismicity, given that the [[Gutenberg\u2013Richter law|b value]] does not significantly vary.\n\nTypical applications are: great global earthquakes and tsunamis,<ref name=\":6\" /> aftershocks and induced seismicity,<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":9\" /> induced seismicity at gas fields,<ref name=\":7\" /> seismic risk to global megacities,<ref name=\":5\" /> studying of clustering of large global earthquakes,<ref name=\":8\" /> etc.\n\n==== Earthquake prediction ====\nNatural time analysis has been initially applied to [[VAN method]] in order to improve the accuracy of the estimation of the time of a forthcoming earthquake that has been indicated to occur by seismic eletric signals (SES). The method deems SES valid when \u03ba<sub>1</sub> = 0.070. Once the SES are deemed valid, a second NT analysis is started in which the subsequent seismic (rather than electric) events are noted, and the region is divided up as a [[Venn diagram]] with at least two seismic events per overlapping rectangle. When \u03ba<sub>1</sub> approaches the value \u03ba<sub>1</sub> = 0.070 for the candidate region, a critical seismic event is considered imminent, i.e. it will occur in a few days to one week or so.<ref>Varotsos, Sarlis & Skordas 2011 (book), chapter 7</ref>\n\n=== Cardiology ===\nNatural time analysis has been experimentally used for the diagnosis of [[heart failure]] syndrome<ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> as well as identifying patients at high risk for [[sudden cardiac death]],<ref name=\":10\" /> even when measuring solely the heart rate, either using far more inexpensive and portable equipment (i.e. [[Pulse oximeter|oximeter]]) or [[electrocardiography]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Economy ===\nDue to similarities of the dynamic characteristics between earthquakes and financial markets, natural time analysis, which is primirily used in seismology, was chosen to assist in developing winning strategies in financial markets, with encouraging results.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n*{{Cite book\n |last1 = Varotsos |first1 = Panayiotis A.\n |last2 = Sarlis   |first2 = Nicholas V.\n |last3 = Skordas  |first3 = Efthimios S.\n |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/755081829\n |title=Natural time analysis : the new view of time ; Precursory seismic electric signals, earthquakes and other complex time series\n |date=2011\n |publisher=Springer\n |isbn=978-3-642-16449-1\n |location=Berlin\n |oclc=755081829\n}}\n\n[[Category:Statistical analysis]]\n", "text_old": "'''Natural time analysis''' is a [[Statistics|statistical method]] applied to analyze [[Complexity|complex time series]] and [[critical phenomena]], based on event counts as a measure of \"time\" rather than the [[Time|clock time]].<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite journal|last=Varotsos|first=P.

A related term, {{math|''p''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, is the ratio {{math|''Q''<sub>''k''</sub> ''/'' ''Q''<sub>''total''</sub>}}, which describes the fractional energy released. The term {{math|&kappa;<sub>1</sub>}} is the variance in natural time:<ref>Varotsos, Sarlis & Skordas 2011 (book), pages 121 & 131</ref>\n\n: <math>\\kappa_1=\\sum_{k=1}^N p_k(\\chi_k)^2 - \\bigl(\\sum_{k=1}^N p_k\\chi_k\\bigr)^2</math>\n\n: where <math>\\textstyle\\chi_k=k/N</math> and <math>\\textstyle\\ p_k=\\frac{Q_k}{\\sum_{n=1}^N Q_n}</math>\n\n== Time reversal ==\nTime reversal, in contrast to clock time, is applicable when studying the approach of a system to criticality with natural time analysis. Living systems for example are considered to operate far from [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]] as there is flow of energy crossing their boundaries, in contrast to deseased organisms where inner driving forces are absent. While time irreversibility is a fundamental property of a living system, the state of death is more time reversible by means of energy flow across the system's boundaries. Thus a critical state of a system can be estimated by applying natural time analysis upon calculating the entropy upon both normal time flow and time reversal and studying the difference of two results.<ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":0\" />[[File:Natural time as applied in cardiology.jpg|thumb|(a) [[Electrocardiography|ECG]] in which the RR distances are marked<br />\n(b) the same ECG plotted in (a) but read in natural time analysis<br />\n(c) ECG at conventional time upon time reversal<br />\n(d) ECG upon time reversal in natural time analysis<br />\nThe length between RR distances in conventional time is aproximately considered as the energy of each pulse (event) in natural time analysis.|400px|alt=|center]]\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Seismology ===\n\n==== Earthquake nowcasting ====\nIn seismology, nowcasting is the estimate of the current dynamic state of a seismological system.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> It differs from forecasting which aims to estimate the probability of a future event<ref name=\":5\" /> but it is also considered a potential base for forecasting<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":1\" />. Nowcasting is based on the [[earthquake cycle]] model, a recurring cycle between pairs of large earthquakes in a geographical area, upon which the system is evaluated using natural time analysis.<ref name=\":1\" /> Nowcasting calculations produce the \"earthquake potential score\", an estimation of the current level of seismic progress.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nWhen applied to seismicity, natural time analysis has the following advantages:<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n# Declustering of the aftershocks is not necessary as natural time count is evenly valid in any case of aftershock or backgroung seismicity.\n# Natural time statistics do not depend on the level of seismicity, given that the [[Gutenberg\u2013Richter law|b value]] does not significantly vary.\n\nTypical applications are: great global earthquakes and tsunamis,<ref name=\":6\" /> aftershocks and induced seismicity,<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":9\" /> induced seismicity at gas fields,<ref name=\":7\" /> seismic risk to global megacities,<ref name=\":5\" /> studying of clustering of large global earthquakes<ref name=\":8\" />, etc.\n\n==== Earthquake prediction ====\nNatural time analysis has been initially applied to [[VAN method]] in order to improve the accuracy of the estimation of the time of a forthcoming earthquake that has been indicated to occur by seismic eletric signals (SES). The method deems SES valid when \u03ba<sub>1</sub> = 0.070. Once the SES are deemed valid, a second NT analysis is started in which the subsequent seismic (rather than electric) events are noted, and the region is divided up as a [[Venn diagram]] with at least two seismic events per overlapping rectangle. When \u03ba<sub>1</sub> approaches the value \u03ba<sub>1</sub> = 0.070 for the candidate region, a critical seismic event is considered imminent, i.e. it will occur in a few days to one week or so.<ref>Varotsos, Sarlis & Skordas 2011 (book), chapter 7</ref>\n\n=== Cardiology ===\nNatural time analysis has been experimentally used for the diagnosis of [[heart failure]] syndrome<ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> as well as identifying patients at high risk for [[sudden cardiac death]]<ref name=\":10\" />, even when measuring solely the heart rate, either using far more inexpensive and portable equipment (i.e. [[Pulse oximeter|oximeter]]) or [[electrocardiography]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Economy ===\nDue to similarities of the dynamic characteristics between earthquakes and financial markets, natural time analysis, which is primirily used in seismology, was chosen to assist in developing winning strategies in financial markets, with encouraging results.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n*{{Cite book\n |last1 = Varotsos |first1 = Panayiotis A.\n |last2 = Sarlis   |first2 = Nicholas V.\n |last3 = Skordas  |first3 = Efthimios S.\n |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/755081829\n |title=Natural time analysis : the new view of time ; Precursory seismic electric signals, earthquakes and other complex time series\n |date=2011\n |publisher=Springer\n |isbn=978-3-642-16449-1\n |location=Berlin\n |oclc=755081829\n}}\n\n[[Category:Statistical analysis]]\n", "name_user": "Keith D", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix PMC warnings, addedorphantag", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_time_analysis"}

The team is named after the [[Emil Frey Gruppe]] a Swiss car dealership for [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]], [[Lexus]] among other marques. Emil Frey Racing was founded in 2011 competing in the [[Blancpain GT Series]] among other series.\n\n==History==\nIn 2011, the family business Emil Frey AG took the decision to set up its own division within the headquarters at Safenwil (AG) to be engaged once again in Motorsport, starting from 2012.\n\nAutomobile and Motorcycle Motorsport has always been highly ranked in the Emil Frey AG. Motorsport is the motivator for top performances in the automobile industry. There is no other place where technical competence can be as efficiently demonstrated as within a sportive competition. It is an excellent stage for image building for an international brand and an important platform to test developments, which will ultimately make road cars safer, more comfortable and of higher quality.\n\nWith Lorenz Frey heading the division as Team Principal and being joined by engaged engineers and employees, Emil Frey Racing was started in its third generation. It is a re-launch of an unforgotten team, which managed to celebrate many highlights in the 30s, 70s and 80s. Company founder Emil Frey tested his motorcycles within the racing world, Walter Frey continued to do so with his MINI Cooper and Toyota. Son Lorenz Frey brings the Emil Frey GT3 Jaguar and the Lexus RC F GT3 back on the race track. For 2019, the team is cooperating with Lamborghini Squadra Corse.\n\n===Jaguar XK Emil Frey G3===\n{{Infobox racing car\n| name = Jaguar XK Emil Frey G3<ref>{{cite web|title=Balance of Performance|url=https://www.blancpain-gt-series.com/documents/notice/118/BALANCE+OF+PERFORMANCE.pdf|website=Blancpain GT Series|accessdate=20 May 2018}}</ref>\n| Image = \n| Caption =\n| Category = \n| Constructor = Emil Frey Racing\n| Designer = \n| Homologation = [[RACB G3]] (G3-105)\n| Production = \n| Predecessor = \n| Successor = \n| Team = Emil Frey Racing\n| Drivers = \n| Technical ref = <!-- <ref name=tech>Insert formatted reference</ref> -->\n| Chassis = [[Jaguar XK (X150)|Jaguar XKR]] based [[aluminium]] [[space frame]]\n| Front suspension = four-way adjustable racing [[Shock absorber|dampers]]\n| Rear suspension = four-way adjustable racing [[Shock absorber|dampers]]\n| Length = <!-- Use: {{convert|XXX|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} -->\n| Width = <!-- Use: {{convert|XXX|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} -->\n| Height = <!-- Use: {{convert|XXX|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} -->\n| Wheelbase = <!-- Use: {{convert|XXX|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} -->\n| Track = <!-- Use: {{convert|XXX|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} -->\n| Engine name = [[Ilmor]] prepared [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]]\n| Capacity = {{convert|5000|cc|cuin|1|abbr=on}}\n| Configuration = [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| Turbo/NA = \n| Engine position = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|front engine]]\n| Gearbox name = [[Xtrac Limited|Xtrac]]\n| Gears = 6-speed\n| Type = [[Sequential manual transmission|sequential]]\n| Differential =\n| Weight = {{convert|1240|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}}\n| Brakes =\n| Tyres = [[Pirelli]] <br> [[BBS Kraftfahrzeugtechnik|BBS]] wheels\n| Tires = <!-- Use this parameter for a label of \"Tires\" -->\n| Competition = [[Blancpain Endurance Series]]\n| Debut = 2012 Blancpain Paul Ricard round\n| First_win =\n| Last_win =\n| Last_event =\n| Entries =\n| Races = 31\n| Wins = 3\n| Podiums = 7\n| Poles = 4\n| Fastest_laps = 0\n}}\nThe team started development of the Jaguar racing car in 2011.

The team is named after the [[Emil Frey Gruppe]] a Swiss car dealership for [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]], [[Lexus]] among other marques. Emil Frey Racing was founded in 2011 competing in the [[Blancpain GT Series]] among other series.\n\n==History==\nIn 2011, the family business Emil Frey AG took the decision to set up its own division within the headquarters at Safenwil (AG) to be engaged once again in Motorsport, starting from 2012.\n\nAutomobile and Motorcycle Motorsport has always been highly ranked in the Emil Frey AG. Motorsport is the motivator for top performances in the automobile industry. There is no other place where technical competence can be as efficiently demonstrated as within a sportive competition. It is an excellent stage for image building for an international brand and an important platform to test developments, which will ultimately make road cars safer, more comfortable and of higher quality.\n\nWith Lorenz Frey heading the division as Team Principal and being joined by engaged engineers and employees, Emil Frey Racing was started in its third generation. It is a re-launch of an unforgotten team, which managed to celebrate many highlights in the 30s, 70s and 80s. Company founder Emil Frey tested his motorcycles within the racing world, Walter Frey continued to do so with his MINI Cooper and Toyota. Son Lorenz Frey brings the Emil Frey GT3 Jaguar and the Lexus RC F GT3 back on the race track. For 2019, the team is cooperating with Lamborghini Squadra Corse.\n\n===Jaguar XK Emil Frey G3===\n{{Infobox racing car\n| name = Jaguar XK Emil Frey G3<ref>{{cite web|title=Balance of Performance|url=https://www.blancpain-gt-series.com/documents/notice/118/BALANCE+OF+PERFORMANCE.pdf|website=Blancpain GT Series|accessdate=20 May 2018}}</ref>\n| Image = \n| Caption =\n| Category = \n| Constructor = Emil Frey Racing\n| Designer = \n| Homologation = [[RACB G3]] (G3-105)\n| Production = \n| Predecessor = \n| Successor = \n| Team = Emil Frey Racing\n| Drivers = \n| Technical ref = <!-- <ref name=tech>Insert formatted reference</ref> -->\n| Chassis = [[Jaguar XK (X150)|Jaguar XKR]] based [[aluminium]] [[space frame]]\n| Front suspension = four-way adjustable racing [[Shock absorber|dampers]]\n| Rear suspension = four-way adjustable racing [[Shock absorber|dampers]]\n| Length = <!-- Use: {{convert|XXX|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} -->\n| Width = <!-- Use: {{convert|XXX|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} -->\n| Height = <!-- Use: {{convert|XXX|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} -->\n| Wheelbase = <!-- Use: {{convert|XXX|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} -->\n| Track = <!-- Use: {{convert|XXX|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} -->\n| Engine name = [[Ilmor]] prepared [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]]\n| Capacity = {{convert|5000|cc|cuin|1|abbr=on}}\n| Configuration = [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| Turbo/NA = \n| Engine position = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|front engine]]\n| Gearbox name = [[Xtrac Limited|Xtrac]]\n| Gears = 6-speed\n| Type = [[Sequential manual transmission|sequential]]\n| Differential =\n| Weight = {{convert|1240|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}}\n| Brakes =\n| Tyres = [[Pirelli]] <br> [[BBS Kraftfahrzeugtechnik|BBS]] wheels\n| Tires = <!-- Use this parameter for a label of \"Tires\" -->\n| Competition = [[Blancpain Endurance Series]]\n| Debut = 2012 Blancpain Paul Ricard round\n| First_win =\n| Last_win =\n| Last_event =\n| Entries =\n| Races = 31\n| Wins = 3\n| Podiums = 7\n| Poles = 4\n| Fastest_laps = 0\n}}\nThe team started development of the Jaguar racing car in 2011.
