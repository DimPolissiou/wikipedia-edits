The [[Tang dynasty]] (AD 618\u2013907) and [[Song dynasty]] (AD 960\u20131279) in particular were periods of great innovation.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn the 7th century, book-printing was developed in China, Korea and [[Japan]], using delicate hand-carved wooden blocks to print individual pages.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} The 9th century ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'' is the earliest known printed document.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Movable type was also used in China for a time, but was abandoned because of the number of characters needed; it would not be until [[Johannes Gutenberg]] that the technique was reinvented in a suitable environment.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn addition to gunpowder, the Chinese also developed improved delivery systems for the [[Byzantine]] weapon of [[Greek fire]], [[Meng Huo You]] and [[Pen Huo Qi]] first used in China ''c.'' 900.<ref name=\"Turnbull\">Turnbull, p. 43.</ref> Chinese illustrations were more realistic than in Byzantine manuscripts,<ref name=\"Turnbull\"/> and detailed accounts from 1044 recommending its use on city walls and ramparts show the brass container as fitted with a horizontal pump, and a nozzle of small diameter.<ref name=\"Turnbull\"/> The records of a battle on the [[Yangtze]] near [[Nanjing]] in 975 offer an insight into the dangers of the weapon, as a change of wind direction blew the fire back onto the Song forces.<ref name=\"Turnbull\"/>\n\n===Song Dynasty===\n{{main|Technology of the Song Dynasty}}\nThe [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131279) brought a new stability for China after a century of civil war, and started a new area of modernisation by encouraging examinations and [[meritocracy]]. The [[Emperor Taizu of Song|first Song Emperor]] created political institutions that allowed a great deal of freedom of discourse and thought, which facilitated the growth of [[science in China|scientific advance]], economic reforms, and achievements in arts and literature.<ref name=\"Money\">''Money of the World'' Special Christmas Edition, Orbis Publishing Ltd, 1998.</ref> Trade flourished both within China and overseas, and the encouragement of technology allowed the mints at [[Kaifeng]] and [[Hangzhou]] to gradually increase in production.<ref name=\"Money\"/> In 1080, the mints of [[Emperor Shenzong of Song China|Emperor Shenzong]] had produced 5 billion coins (roughly 50 per Chinese citizen), and the first banknotes were produced in 1023.<ref name=\"Money\"/> These coins were so durable that they would still be in use 700 years later, in the 18th century.<ref name=\"Money\"/>\n\nThere were many famous inventors and early scientists in the Song Dynasty period. The statesman [[Shen Kuo]] is best known for his book known as the ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'' (1088 AD). In it, he wrote of use for a [[drydock]] to repair boats, the navigational magnetic [[compass]], and the discovery of the concept of [[true north]] (with magnetic declination towards the [[North Pole]]). Shen Kuo also devised a geological theory for land formation, or [[geomorphology]], and theorized that there was [[Climate change (general concept)|climate change]] in geological regions over an enormous span of time.\n\nThe equally talented statesman [[Su Song]] was best known for his engineering project of the [[Astronomical]] [[Clock tower|Clock Tower]] of [[Kaifeng]], by 1088 AD. The clock tower was driven by a rotating waterwheel and [[escapement]] mechanism. Crowning the top of the clock tower was the large bronze, mechanically-driven, rotating [[armillary sphere]]. In 1070, Su Song also compiled the ''Ben Cao Tu Jing'' (Illustrated Pharmacopoeia, original source material from 1058\u20131061 AD) with a team of scholars. This [[pharmaceutical]] treatise covered a wide range of other related subjects, including [[botany]], [[zoology]], [[mineralogy]], and [[metallurgy]].\n\n[[Chinese astronomy|Chinese astronomers]] were the first to record observations of a [[supernova]], the first being the [[SN 185]], recorded during the [[Han dynasty]]. Chinese astronomers made two more notable supernova observations during the Song Dynasty: the [[SN 1006]], the brightest recorded supernova in history; and the [[SN 1054]], making the [[Crab Nebula]] the first astronomical object recognized as being connected to a supernova explosion.<ref name=\"Mayall\">Mayall N.U.

Shen believed that land was reshaped over time due to perpetual [[erosion]], uplift, and deposition of [[silt]], and cited his observance of horizontal strata of fossils embedded in a [[Taihang Mountains|cliffside at Taihang]] as evidence that the area was once the location of an ancient seashore that had shifted hundreds of miles east over an enormous span of time.<ref>Joseph Needham, ''Science and Civilization in China: Volume 3, Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth'' (Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd., 1986) pp. 603\u2013604, 618.</ref><ref>Nathan Sivin, ''Science in Ancient China: Researches and Reflections.''

Many hypotheses have been proposed ranging from the cultural to the political and economic. [[John K. Fairbank]], for example, argued that the Chinese political system was hostile to scientific progress. As for Needham, he wrote that cultural factors prevented traditional Chinese achievements from developing into what could be called \"science.\" It was the religious and philosophical framework of the Chinese intellectuals which made them unable to believe in the ideas of laws of nature:\n{{quote\n | It was not that there was no order in nature for the Chinese, but rather that it was not an order ordained by a rational personal being, and hence there was no conviction that rational personal beings would be able to spell out in their lesser earthly languages the divine code of laws which he had decreed aforetime. The [[Taoists]], indeed, would have scorned such an idea as being too na\u00efve for the subtlety and complexity of the universe as they intuited it.\n |<ref>{{harvnb|Needham|Wang|1954}}, p. 581.</ref>\n}}\n\nAnother prominent historian of science, [[Nathan Sivin]], has argued that China indeed had a scientific revolution in the 17th century but it's just that we are still not able to really understand the scientific revolution that took place in China. Sivin suggests that we need to look at the scientific development in China on its own terms.<ref>[http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~nsivin/scirev.pdf]</ref>\n\nThere are also questions about the philosophy behind traditional Chinese medicine, which, derived partly from Taoist philosophy, reflects the classical Chinese belief that individual human experiences express causative principles effective in the environment at all scales. Because its theory predates use of the [[scientific method]], it has received various criticisms based on scientific thinking. Philosopher [[Robert Todd Carroll]], a member of the Skeptics Society, deemed acupuncture a [[pseudoscience]] because it \"confuse(s) metaphysical claims with empirical claims\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/pseudosc.html|title=pseudoscience - The Skeptic's Dictionary - Skepdic.com|author=|date=|website=skepdic.com}}</ref>\n\nMore recent historians have questioned political and cultural explanations and have put greater focus on economic causes.  Mark Elvin's [[high level equilibrium trap]] is one well-known example of this line of thought. It argues that the Chinese population was large enough, workers cheap enough, and agrarian productivity high enough to not require mechanization: thousands of Chinese workers were perfectly able to quickly perform any needed task. Other events such as [[Haijin]], the Opium Wars and the resulting hate of European influence prevented China from undergoing an Industrial Revolution; copying Europe's progress on a large scale would be impossible for a lengthy period of time.  Political instability under [[Empress Dowager Cixi|Cixi]] rule (opposition and frequent oscillation between modernists and conservatives), the Republican wars (1911\u20131933), the Sino-Japanese War (1933\u20131945), the Communist/Nationalist War (1945\u20131949) as well as the later [[Cultural Revolution]] isolated China at the most critical times. [[Kenneth Pomeranz]] has made the argument that the substantial resources taken from the [[New World]] to Europe made the crucial difference between European and Chinese development.\n\nIn his book ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'', [[Jared Diamond]] postulates that the lack of geographic barriers within much of China{{mdash}}essentially a wide plain with two large navigable rivers and a relatively smooth coastline{{mdash}}led to a single government without competition.  At the whim of a ruler who disliked new inventions, technology could be stifled for half a century or more.  In contrast, Europe's barriers of the Pyrenees, the Alps, and the various defensible peninsulas (Denmark, Scandinavia, Italy, Greece, etc.) and islands (Britain, Ireland, Sicily, etc.) led to smaller countries in constant competition with each other.  If a ruler chose to ignore a scientific advancement (especially a military or economic one), his more-advanced neighbors would soon usurp his throne. This explanation, however, ignores the fact that [[Warring States period|China had been]] [[Six Dynasties|politically fragmented]] [[Southern Song#Southern Song, 1127\u20131279|in the past]], and was thus not inherently disposed to political unification.<ref>James M. Blaut, \"Environmentalism and Eurocentrism,\" Geographical Review 89.3 (1999): 391\u2013408.</ref>\n\n== The Republic of China (1912\u201349) ==\nThe [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)]] saw the introduction in earnest of modern science to China. Large numbers of Chinese students studied abroad in Japan and in Europe and the US. Many returned to help teach and to found numerous schools and universities. Among them were numerous outstanding figures, including [[Cai Yuanpei]], [[Hu Shih]], [[Weng Wenhao]], [[Ding Wenjiang]], [[Fu Ssu-nien]], and many others. As a result, there was a tremendous growth of modern science in China. As the Communist Party took over China's mainland in 1949, some of these Chinese scientists and institutions moved to Taiwan. The central science academy, [[Academia Sinica]], also moved there.\n\n== People's Republic of China ==\n{{main|History of science and technology in the People's Republic of China}}\n{{see also|Science and technology in the People's Republic of China}}\n\nAfter the establishment of the People's Republic in 1949, China reorganized its science establishment along [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] lines. Although the country regressed scientifically as a result of government policies which led to famine during the [[Great Leap Forward]] and political chaos during the [[Cultural Revolution]], scientific research in nuclear weapons and satellite launching still gained great success. From 1975, science and technology was one of the [[Four Modernizations]], and its high-speed development was declared essential to all national economic development by [[Deng Xiaoping]].  Other civilian technologies such as superconductivity and high-yield hybrid rice led to new developments due to the application of science to industry and foreign [[technology transfer]].\n\nAs the People's Republic of China becomes better connected to the [[economic globalization|global economy]], the government has placed more emphasis on science and technology. This has led to increases in funding, improved scientific structure, and more money for research. These factors have led to advancements in [[agriculture]], [[medicine]], [[genetics]], and [[global change]]. In 2003, the [[Chinese space program]] allowed China to become the third country to send humans into space, and ambition to put a man on mars by 2030. In the 2000s and 2010s, China became a top scientific and industrial power in more advanced fields such as [[super computing]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[High-speed rail in China|bullet trains]], [[aeronautics]], [[nuclear physics]] researches and other fields.\n\nIn 2016, China became the country with the highest science output, as measured in publications. While the US had been the biggest producer of scientific studies until then, China published 426,000 studies in 2016 while the US published 409,000.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-00927-4|title=China declared world's largest producer of scientific articles|last=Tollefson|first=Jeff|date=2018-01-18|access-date=2018-01-26|language=EN|doi=10.1038/d41586-018-00927-4|bibcode=2018Natur.553..390T}}</ref> However, the numbers are somewhat relative, as it also depends how authorship on international collaborations is counted (e.g. if one paper is counted per person or whether authorship is split among authors).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|China|History|Science|Technology}}\n* [[Chinese astronomy]]\n* [[Chinese mathematics]]\n* [[History of Chinese archaeology]]\n* [[List of Chinese discoveries]]\n* [[List of Chinese inventions]]\n* [[Military history of China]]\n* [[History of canals in China]]\n* ''[[Science and Civilization in China]]''\n* [[Traditional Chinese medicine]]\n* [[Two Bombs, One Satellite]]\n* ''[[Yongle Encyclopedia]]''\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* Patricia Buckley Ebrey, ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of China''.

One modern historian writes that in late Ming courts, the Jesuits were \"regarded as impressive especially for their knowledge of astronomy, calendar-making, mathematics, hydraulics, and geography.\"<ref>Patricia Buckley Ebrey, p. 212.</ref> The [[Society of Jesus]] introduced, according to [[Thomas Woods]], \"a substantial body of scientific knowledge and a vast array of mental tools for understanding the physical universe, including the Euclidean geometry that made planetary motion comprehensible.\"<ref name=\"Thomas Woods 2005\"/> Another expert quoted by Woods said the scientific revolution brought by the Jesuits coincided with a time when science was at a very low level in China:\n{{quote|[The Jesuits] made efforts to translate western mathematical and astronomical works into Chinese and aroused the interest of Chinese scholars in these sciences. They made very extensive astronomical observation and carried out the first modern cartographic work in China. They also learned to appreciate the scientific achievements of this ancient culture and made them known in Europe. Through their correspondence European scientists first learned about the Chinese science and culture.|<ref name=\"Udias\" />}}\n\nConversely, the Jesuits were very active in transmitting Chinese knowledge to Europe. [[Confucius]]'s works were translated into European languages through the agency of Jesuit scholars stationed in China. [[Matteo Ricci]] started to report on the thoughts of Confucius, and Father Prospero Intorcetta published the life and works of Confucius into [[Latin]] in 1687.<ref>\"Windows into China\", John Parker, p. 25.</ref> It is thought that such works had considerable importance on European thinkers of the period, particularly among the [[Deists]] and other philosophical groups of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] who were interested by the integration of the system of morality of Confucius into [[Christianity]].<ref>\"Windows into China\", John Parker, p. 25, {{ISBN|0-89073-050-4}}</ref><ref>\"The Eastern origins of Western civilization\", John Hobson, p. 194-195, {{ISBN|0-521-54724-5}}</ref>\n\nThe followers of the French [[physiocrat]] [[Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay]] habitually referred to him as \"the Confucius of Europe\", and he personally identified himself with the Chinese sage.<ref>Rothbard, p 366</ref> The doctrine and even the name of \"[[Laissez-faire]]\" may have been inspired by the Chinese concept of [[Wu wei]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/economicHistory/GEHN/GEHNPDF/WorkingPaper12CG.pdf|title=Department of Economic History|first=London School of Economics and Political|last=Science|date=|website=lse.ac.uk}}</ref><ref>\"The Eastern Origins of Western Civilization\", John M.

Many hypotheses have been proposed ranging from the cultural to the political and economic. [[John K. Fairbank]], for example, argued that the Chinese political system was hostile to scientific progress. As for Needham, he wrote that cultural factors prevented traditional Chinese achievements from developing into what could be called \"science.\" It was the religious and philosophical framework of the Chinese intellectuals which made them unable to believe in the ideas of laws of nature:\n{{quote\n | It was not that there was no order in nature for the Chinese, but rather that it was not an order ordained by a rational personal being, and hence there was no conviction that rational personal beings would be able to spell out in their lesser earthly languages the divine code of laws which he had decreed aforetime. The [[Taoists]], indeed, would have scorned such an idea as being too na\u00efve for the subtlety and complexity of the universe as they intuited it.\n |<ref>{{harvnb|Needham|Wang|1954}}, p. 581.</ref>\n}}\n\nAnother prominent historian of science, [[Nathan Sivin]], has argued that China indeed had a scientific revolution in the 17th century but it's just that we are still not able to really understand the scientific revolution that took place in China. Sivin suggests that we need to look at the scientific development in China on its own terms.<ref>[http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~nsivin/scirev.pdf]</ref>\n\nThere are also questions about the philosophy behind traditional Chinese medicine, which, derived partly from Taoist philosophy, reflects the classical Chinese belief that individual human experiences express causative principles effective in the environment at all scales. Because its theory predates use of the [[scientific method]], it has received various criticisms based on scientific thinking. Philosopher [[Robert Todd Carroll]], a member of the Skeptics Society, deemed acupuncture a [[pseudoscience]] because it \"confuse(s) metaphysical claims with empirical claims\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://skepdic.com/pseudosc.html|title=pseudoscience - The Skeptic's Dictionary - Skepdic.com|author=|date=|website=skepdic.com}}</ref>\n\nMore recent historians have questioned political and cultural explanations and have put greater focus on economic causes.  Mark Elvin's [[high level equilibrium trap]] is one well-known example of this line of thought. It argues that the Chinese population was large enough, workers cheap enough, and agrarian productivity high enough to not require mechanization: thousands of Chinese workers were perfectly able to quickly perform any needed task. Other events such as [[Haijin]], the Opium Wars and the resulting hate of European influence prevented China from undergoing an Industrial Revolution; copying Europe's progress on a large scale would be impossible for a lengthy period of time.  Political instability under [[Empress Dowager Cixi|Cixi]] rule (opposition and frequent oscillation between modernists and conservatives), the Republican wars (1911\u20131933), the Sino-Japanese War (1933\u20131945), the Communist/Nationalist War (1945\u20131949) as well as the later [[Cultural Revolution]] isolated China at the most critical times. [[Kenneth Pomeranz]] has made the argument that the substantial resources taken from the [[New World]] to Europe made the crucial difference between European and Chinese development.\n\nIn his book ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'', [[Jared Diamond]] postulates that the lack of geographic barriers within much of China{{mdash}}essentially a wide plain with two large navigable rivers and a relatively smooth coastline{{mdash}}led to a single government without competition.  At the whim of a ruler who disliked new inventions, technology could be stifled for half a century or more.  In contrast, Europe's barriers of the Pyrenees, the Alps, and the various defensible peninsulas (Denmark, Scandinavia, Italy, Greece, etc.) and islands (Britain, Ireland, Sicily, etc.) led to smaller countries in constant competition with each other.  If a ruler chose to ignore a scientific advancement (especially a military or economic one), his more-advanced neighbors would soon usurp his throne. This explanation, however, ignores the fact that [[Warring States period|China had been]] [[Six Dynasties|politically fragmented]] [[Southern Song#Southern Song, 1127\u20131279|in the past]], and was thus not inherently disposed to political unification.<ref>James M. Blaut, \"Environmentalism and Eurocentrism,\" Geographical Review 89.3 (1999): 391\u2013408.</ref>\n\n== The Republic of China (1912\u201349) ==\nThe [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)]] saw the introduction in earnest of modern science to China. Large numbers of Chinese students studied abroad in Japan and in Europe and the US. Many returned to help teach and to found numerous schools and universities. Among them were numerous outstanding figures, including [[Cai Yuanpei]], [[Hu Shih]], [[Weng Wenhao]], [[Ding Wenjiang]], [[Fu Ssu-nien]], and many others. As a result, there was a tremendous growth of modern science in China. As the Communist Party took over China's mainland in 1949, some of these Chinese scientists and institutions moved to Taiwan. The central science academy, [[Academia Sinica]], also moved there.\n\n== People's Republic of China ==\n{{main|History of science and technology in the People's Republic of China}}\n{{see also|Science and technology in the People's Republic of China}}\n\nAfter the establishment of the People's Republic in 1949, China reorganized its science establishment along [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] lines. Although the country regressed scientifically as a result of government policies which led to famine during the [[Great Leap Forward]] and political chaos during the [[Cultural Revolution]], scientific research in nuclear weapons and satellite launching still gained great success. From 1975, science and technology was one of the [[Four Modernizations]], and its high-speed development was declared essential to all national economic development by [[Deng Xiaoping]].  Other civilian technologies such as superconductivity and high-yield hybrid rice led to new developments due to the application of science to industry and foreign [[technology transfer]].\n\nAs the People's Republic of China becomes better connected to the [[economic globalization|global economy]], the government has placed more emphasis on science and technology. This has led to increases in funding, improved scientific structure, and more money for research. These factors have led to advancements in [[agriculture]], [[medicine]], [[genetics]], and [[global change]]. In 2003, the [[Chinese space program]] allowed China to become the third country to send humans into space, and ambition to put a man on mars by 2030. In the 2000s and 2010s, China became a top scientific and industrial power in more advanced fields such as [[super computing]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[High-speed rail in China|bullet trains]], [[aeronautics]], [[nuclear physics]] researches and other fields.\n\nIn 2016, China became the country with the highest science output, as measured in publications. While the US had been the biggest producer of scientific studies until then, China published 426,000 studies in 2016 while the US published 409,000.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-00927-4|title=China declared world's largest producer of scientific articles|last=Tollefson|first=Jeff|date=2018-01-18|access-date=2018-01-26|language=EN|doi=10.1038/d41586-018-00927-4|bibcode=2018Natur.553..390T}}</ref> However, the numbers are somewhat relative, as it also depends how authorship on international collaborations is counted (e.g. if one paper is counted per person or whether authorship is split among authors).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|China|History|Science|Technology}}\n* [[Chinese astronomy]]\n* [[Chinese mathematics]]\n* [[History of Chinese archaeology]]\n* [[List of Chinese discoveries]]\n* [[List of Chinese inventions]]\n* [[Military history of China]]\n* [[History of canals in China]]\n* ''[[Science and Civilization in China]]''\n* [[Traditional Chinese medicine]]\n* [[Two Bombs, One Satellite]]\n* ''[[Yongle Encyclopedia]]''\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* Patricia Buckley Ebrey, ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of China''.

{"title_page": "First Doctor comic stories", "text_new": "\n\n'''First Doctor comic stories''' refers to the [[List of Doctor Who comic stories|comic strips]] devoted to the long-running British [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', using the likeness of the [[First Doctor]] [[William Hartnell]]. The strip was launched in [[Polystyle Publications|Polystyle's]] ''[[TV Comic]]'' on 14 November 1964, less than a year after the television series began broadcasting and was the first original [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] media from the show.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This strip began what has become known as the '[[Doctor Who Polystyle comic strip|Polystyle era]]': running from 1964 to 1979.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-11\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 11</ref> The First Doctor starred in this strip running parallel with his appearance on the television show, ending in December 1966, after which ''TV Comic'' began creating strips for the [[Second Doctor]]. The franchise to print a regular comic strip passed to ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' (then ''Doctor Who Weekly'') in 1979, and was opened up to multiple franchises in the mid-2000s. During this time, the First Doctor has made various guest appearances as well as starring in some one-off comic strips. \n\n== Polystyle comic strips (1964-1966) ==\n\n=== History ===\n\n''TV Comic'', according to ''Doctor Who'' historian Jeremy Bentham, 'had grown up in the wake of commercial television. Just as publications like ''[[Radio Fun]]'' had blossomed during the golden years of the wireless so ''TV Comic'' began catering for young readerships who watched and liked children's programmes on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]].<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-15\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 15</ref> ''TV Comic'' - despite only having previously featured spin-offs of ITV programmes, decided to pitch for ''Doctor Who'' with the [[BBC]], and despite initial reticence from the channel, eventually struck a deal.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> The strip launched in issue 674 with a cover date of 14 November 1964; hitting the shelves - according to ''Doctor Who'' comics historian Paul Scoones - on 8 November 1964.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This means that the ''Doctor Who'' comic strip in ''TV Comic'' was officially the first spin-off media from the show - the first novelization ''[[The_Daleks#In_print|Doctor Who in an exciting adventure with the Daleks]]'' not being released until later the same week on 12 November.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> One immediate difference from the TV show was that the Doctor would be referred to in-strip as 'Doctor Who'.\n\nThere were other differences too. The rights to use ''Doctor Who'' applied 'then, as now' only applied to the likeness of the actor playing the Doctor and the TARDIS, and the portrayal of any other characters - be they companions or adversaries - would have been a separate negotiation and an increased cost, even prohibitive for companions who would appear in every installment.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> Accordingly, the Doctor was given new companions in the first strip, \"The Klepton Parasites\", two grandchildren Gillian and John. Regarding ''Doctor Who'' foes, the situation was very similar. During the First Doctor period of the ''TV Comic'' strip, only the inhabitants of [[Vortis (Doctor Who)|Vortis]] from \"[[The Web Planet]]\" (1965) - the [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(Q\u2013Z)#Zarbi|Zarbi]] and [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(H\u2013P)#Menoptra|Menoptra]] - made it into a story. The Doctor's greatest adversaries - the [[Dalek|Daleks]] - could not appear for another reason. This was that creator ([[Terry Nation]]) had 'a separate copyright' for the creatures, and had negotiated a deal with ''[[TV Century 21]]'' (aka ''TV21'') comics around the same time for their own strip; and copyright could 'only be held by one company at any one time' for the same format.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-17\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 17</ref> \"[[Dalek_comic_strips,_illustrated_annuals_and_graphic_novels#Comics|The Daleks]]\" strip appeared in issue 1 of ''TV21'' (23 January 1965), and ran for one hundred and four installments, each a page long, ending in issue 104 (14 January 1967).\n\n=== Writers and Artists ===\n\n'''''Artists:''''' There were three artists during the ''TV Comic'' First Doctor period. '''Neville Main''' was the first to draw the First Doctor (and thus to draw any incarnation of the Doctor).<ref name=\"Scoones2012-23-61\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 23-61</ref> Main drew the first 9 stories (46 episodes) of the ''TVC'' strip, plus one single episode strip for the 1965 ''TVC Holiday Special'' and two single episode strips for the 1965 ''TVC Annual 1966''. '''Bill Mevin''' took over for the middle of the run, producing 7 stories (28 episodes) for ''TVC'' between October 1965 and April 1966.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-62-75\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 62-75</ref> Although he produced no ''TVC Holiday Special'' or ''TVC Annual'' strips during this time, he returned later in 1966 to draw one of the two strips single episode strips for that year's ''TVC Annual 1967''.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-91\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 91</ref> After Mevin's relatively short tenure, the ''TVC'' strip was taken on by '''John Canning''' who produced 8 stories (36 episodes) plus two single episode strips for the 1966 ''TVC Holiday Special'' and one of the two single episode strips for the 1966 ''TVC Annual 1967''.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-77-96\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 77-96</ref> Canning was thus the last of the three artists to draw the First Doctor for ''TVC'', and, furthermore, would go on to kick off the Second Doctor run which began late December 1966.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-100\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 100</ref>\n\n'''''Writers:''''' The situation with the scripts is more complex. Writing in 1982, Jeremy Bentham, the first researcher of ''Doctor Who'' comic strips, commented that in 'those days the notion of a strip having a separate writer was strictly the prerogative of American comic books'.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> However, this view was later revised. John Ainsworth, another comic strip historian, said in an interview: 'There's quite a mystery surrounding around who actually wrote the scripts for the early Hartnell ''Doctor Who'' strips, or indeed, all the Hartnell ''Doctor Who'' strips. It was thought that the artists wrote them, but, after talking to [...] one of the artists, Bill Mevin [...] he doesn't know who wrote them but he knows he did actually work from scripts someone else provided'<ref name=\"Stripped for Action-00:07:01-00:07:24\">''Stripped for Action'' (2008), 00:07:01-00:07:24</ref> In the same documentary, Mevin confirmed this saying, ''TVC'' strips were 'a production line [...] a conveyor belt. I'd get a script and I'd draw it'.<ref name=\"Stripped for Action-00:07:24-00:08:27\">''Stripped for Action'' (2008), 00:07:24-00:08:27</ref> Later research by Paul Scoones in ''The Comic Strip Companion: The Unofficial and Unauthorised Guide to Doctor Who in Comics: 1964-1979'' (2012) clarified some aspects of script production.\n\n'''''Style:''''' Bentham describes Main's output thus: very simplistic in style, consisting of basic line illustrations drawn in a very cartoonish way. During his 45 week stint on the strip he never quite captured the likeness of Hartnell [...] He was, however, quite an inventive storywriter.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref>\n\n=== List of comic strips ===\n\nThe list below is of all the First Doctor comic strips that appeared in ''TV Comic'' (''TVC'') as well the yearly ''TV Comic Holiday Special'' (''TVCHS'') and ''TV Comic Annual'' (''TVCA'').

The strip was launched in [[Polystyle Publications|Polystyle's]] ''[[TV Comic]]'' on 14 November 1964, less than a year after the television series began broadcasting and was the first original [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] media from the show.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This strip began what has become known as the '[[Doctor Who Polystyle comic strip|Polystyle era]]': running from 1964 to 1979.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-11\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 11</ref> The First Doctor starred in this strip running parallel with his appearance on the television show, ending in December 1966, after which ''TV Comic'' began creating strips for the [[Second Doctor]]. The franchise to print a regular comic strip passed to ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' (then ''Doctor Who Weekly'') in 1979, and was opened up to multiple franchises in the mid-2000s. During this time, the First Doctor has made various guest appearances as well as starring in some one-off comic strips. \n\n== Polystyle comic strips (1964-1966) ==\n\n=== History ===\n\n''TV Comic'', according to ''Doctor Who'' historian Jeremy Bentham, 'had grown up in the wake of commercial television. Just as publications like ''[[Radio Fun]]'' had blossomed during the golden years of the wireless so ''TV Comic'' began catering for young readerships who watched and liked children's programmes on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]].<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-15\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 15</ref> ''TV Comic'' - despite only having previously featured spin-offs of ITV programmes, decided to pitch for ''Doctor Who'' with the [[BBC]], and despite initial reticence from the channel, eventually struck a deal.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> The strip launched in issue 674 with a cover date of 14 November 1964; hitting the shelves - according to ''Doctor Who'' comics historian Paul Scoones - on 8 November 1964.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This means that the ''Doctor Who'' comic strip in ''TV Comic'' was officially the first spin-off media from the show - the first novelization ''[[The_Daleks#In_print|Doctor Who in an exciting adventure with the Daleks]]'' not being released until later the same week on 12 November.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> One immediate difference from the TV show was that the Doctor would be referred to in-strip as 'Doctor Who'.\n\nThere were other differences too. The rights to use ''Doctor Who'' applied 'then, as now' only applied to the likeness of the actor playing the Doctor and the TARDIS, and the portrayal of any other characters - be they companions or adversaries - would have been a separate negotiation and an increased cost, even prohibitive for companions who would appear in every installment.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> Accordingly, the Doctor was given new companions in the first strip, \"The Klepton Parasites\", two grandchildren Gillian and John. Regarding ''Doctor Who'' foes, the situation was very similar. During the First Doctor period of the ''TV Comic'' strip, only the inhabitants of [[Vortis (Doctor Who)|Vortis]] from \"[[The Web Planet]]\" (1965) - the [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(Q\u2013Z)#Zarbi|Zarbi]] and [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(H\u2013P)#Menoptra|Menoptra]] - made it into a story. The Doctor's greatest adversaries - the [[Dalek|Daleks]] - could not appear for another reason. This was that creator ([[Terry Nation]]) had 'a separate copyright' for the creatures, and had negotiated a deal with ''[[TV Century 21]]'' (aka ''TV21'') comics around the same time for their own strip; and copyright could 'only be held by one company at any one time' for the same format.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-17\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 17</ref> \"[[Dalek_comic_strips,_illustrated_annuals_and_graphic_novels#Comics|The Daleks]]\" strip appeared in issue 1 of ''TV21'' (23 January 1965), and ran for one hundred and four installments, each a page long, ending in issue 104 (14 January 1967).\n\n=== Writers and Artists ===\n\n'''''Artists:''''' There were three artists during the ''TV Comic'' First Doctor period. '''Neville Main''' was the first to draw the First Doctor (and thus to draw any incarnation of the Doctor).<ref name=\"Scoones2012-23-61\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 23-61</ref> Main drew the first 9 stories (46 episodes) of the ''TVC'' strip, plus one single episode strip for the 1965 ''TVC Holiday Special'' and two single episode strips for the 1965 ''TVC Annual 1966''. '''Bill Mevin''' took over for the middle of the run, producing 7 stories (28 episodes) for ''TVC'' between October 1965 and April 1966.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-62-75\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 62-75</ref> Although he produced no ''TVC Holiday Special'' or ''TVC Annual'' strips during this time, he returned later in 1966 to draw one of the two strips single episode strips for that year's ''TVC Annual 1967''.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-91\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 91</ref> After Mevin's relatively short tenure, the ''TVC'' strip was taken on by '''John Canning''' who produced 8 stories (36 episodes) plus two single episode strips for the 1966 ''TVC Holiday Special'' and one of the two single episode strips for the 1966 ''TVC Annual 1967''.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-77-96\">\"Scoones (2012), pp. 77-96</ref> Canning was thus the last of the three artists to draw the First Doctor for ''TVC'', and, furthermore, would go on to kick off the Second Doctor run which began late December 1966.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-100\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 100</ref>\n\n'''''Writers:''''' The situation with the scripts is more complex. Writing in 1982, Jeremy Bentham, the first researcher of ''Doctor Who'' comic strips, commented that in 'those days the notion of a strip having a separate writer was strictly the prerogative of American comic books'.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> However, this view was later revised. John Ainsworth, another comic strip historian, said in an interview: 'There's quite a mystery surrounding around who actually wrote the scripts for the early Hartnell ''Doctor Who'' strips, or indeed, all the Hartnell ''Doctor Who'' strips. It was thought that the artists wrote them, but, after talking to [...] one of the artists, Bill Mevin [...] he doesn't know who wrote them but he knows he did actually work from scripts someone else provided'<ref name=\"Stripped for Action-00:07:01-00:07:24\">''Stripped for Action'' (2008), 00:07:01-00:07:24</ref> In the same documentary, Mevin confirmed this saying, ''TVC'' strips were 'a production line [...] a conveyor belt. I'd get a script and I'd draw it'.<ref name=\"Stripped for Action-00:07:24-00:08:27\">''Stripped for Action'' (2008), 00:07:24-00:08:27</ref>\n\n'''''Style:''''' Bentham describes Main's output thus: very simplistic in style, consisting of basic line illustrations drawn in a very cartoonish way. During his 45 week stint on the strip he never quite captured the likeness of Hartnell [...] He was, however, quite an inventive storywriter.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref>\n\n=== List of comic strips ===\n\nThe list below is of all the First Doctor comic strips that appeared in ''TV Comic'' (''TVC'') as well the yearly ''TV Comic Holiday Special'' (''TVCHS'') and ''TV Comic Annual'' (''TVCA''). The order is that designated by the publication date, as integrated by Paul Scoones.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-7\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 7</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n\n|style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''#'''{{ref label|TVC_a|a|}} ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Title'''{{ref label|TVC_b|b|}} ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Companions''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Featuring''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Pub.''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"| '''Issues''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Ep#''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Date''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"| '''Format''' ||style=\"background:#ebebeb\"| '''Writer''' || style=\"background:#ebebeb\"|'''Artist''' \n|-\n\n| 01 || \"The Klepton Parasites\" || Gillian/John || Kleptons || ''TVC'' ||674 - 683 || 10|| 14 Nov 1964 - 16 Jan 1965  || B&W || ?

Initially, a 10 kilometre (6.2&nbsp;mi) line from [[Tangshan]] to [[Xugezhuang]] built in 1881 to transport coal from the coal mine in Tangshan, this line was extended to [[Tianjin]] in 1888 and [[Shanhaiguan District|Shanhaiguan]] and [[Suizhong]] in 1894. This railway became known as the \"Guanneiwai Railway\" (literally, inner and outer Shanhaiguan railway).  The railway was backed by the powerful [[Viceroy of Zhili]], [[Li Hongzhang]], who overcame objections from conservative ministers.  To secure the support of the [[Empress Dowager]] for railway construction,  Li Hongzhang imported a small train set from Germany and built a {{convert|2|km}} [[narrow gauge]] railway from her residence in [[Zhongnanhai]] to her dining hall in [[Beihai Park|Beihai]] in 1888.<ref name=\"Dong2002p35\">{{cite book |last=Dong| first=Madeleine Yue|editor-first=Joseph W| editor-last=Esherick|title=Remaking the Chinese City: Modernity and National Identity, 1900-1950|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=2002 |pages=35|chapter=Chapter 8: Defining Beiping - Urban Reconstruction and National Identity, 1928-1936|isbn=0-8248-2518-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JYaQ0tsBP30C&pg=PA123&dq=beiping#v=onepage&q=palace%20museum&f=false|ref=Dong 2002}}</ref>  The Empress, concerned that the locomotive's noise would disturb the [[geomancy]] or ''[[fengshui]]'' of the imperial city, required the train be pulled by [[eunuchs]] instead of steam engine.<ref name=\"Dong2002p35\"/>\n\nThe next effort was made by [[Taiwan]] Governor [[Liu Mingchuan]]. From 1887 to 1893, {{convert|107|km}} of railway tracks were laid from [[Keelung]] to [[Taipei]] to [[Hsinchu]]. However, this railway was later demolished for modernization when Taiwan was under [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]].\n\n===Rapid development during 1895-1911===\n[[File:Namitibridge.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Faux Namti Bridge]] on the [[Yunnan\u2013Vietnam Railway]] was built by France in 1906.]]\n[[File:South Manchuria Railway LOC 03283.jpg|thumb|A train on [[South Manchuria Railway]]]]\nQing China's defeat in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] greatly stimulated the railway development as the government both recognized the importance of modernization and was compelled by foreign powers to grant concessions to build railways along with settlement and mineral rights.  The imperial powers then took to building railways in their spheres of influence. The railroads already built in 1900 had a total length of only 292 miles. Another 4000 miles were in the planning stage.<ref>''Appletons' annual cyclopaedia and register of important events of the year 1901'' (1902) p 151.</ref>\n\nThe British built the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway (1905-1908) and [[Kowloon-Canton Railway]] (completed 1911).  The French built the [[Sino-Vietnamese Railway]] (1904\u201310), an 855&nbsp;km {{RailGauge|1000mm}} line to connect Kunming with Vietnam, then a colony of French Indochina.  The Germans built the [[Jiaoji Railway]] in Shandong Province.  British and German industrialists jointly built the [[Tianjin\u2013Pukou Railway]]. The Americans built the [[Canton - Sam Shui Railway]] in Guangdong in 1902\u201304.  Czarist Russia built the [[China Eastern Railway]] (1897-1901) as a shortcut for the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] and the [[Southern Manchuria Railway]] to [[Port Arthur, China|Port Arthur]].  To prevent domination by bigger powers, the Qing Court gave the rights to the Lugouqiao-Hankou Railway to Belgians.  The Japanese initially received numerous concessions along the coast of Fujian and Guangdong, and built the [[Chao Chow and Swatow Railway]] (1904\u201306).  After winning the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1904, the Japanese took over the southern section of the China Eastern Railway (from Changchun to Port Arthur) and the entire Southern Manchuria Railway.\n\nBy 1911, there were around 9,000&nbsp;km of rails in China. Most of the rails used the {{RailGauge|1435mm|allk=on}}.\n[[File:KCRC early railway network of China.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Map showing early railway expansion in China.]]\n[[File:Hankou-Dazhimen-Station-0238.jpg|right|thumb|Hankou Dazhimen Station, the original southern terminal of the [[Jinghan Railway]]]]\n\nThe imperial capital, [[Beijing]], was designed as the center of the Chinese railway network. Several lines radiated out from Beijing. Three main lines are [[Jingguang railway|Beijing-Hankou Railway]], [[Jingha railway|Beijing-Fengtian Railway]], and [[Tianjin-Pukou Railway]]. Jinghan railway was from eh Beijing to [[Hankou]]. The construction started in 1897 and was completed in 1906. The Guangneiwai railway was extended west to Beijing and east to [[Shenyang|Fengtian]] by 1912 and renamed as Beijing-Fengtian Railway. The Tianjin-Pukou Railway, built from 1908&ndash;1912.  It ran from Tianjin, which was connected by the Beijing-Fengtian Railway, to [[Pukou]] across the Yangtze River from Nanjing.\n\n===Railway protection movement and the Xinhai Revolution===\n{{main|Railway Protection Movement}}\n[[File:Zhangtianyoux.jpg|left|upright|thumbnail|[[Zhan Tianyou]], the \"father of China's railways\"]]\nThe rapid expansion of foreign railroad ownership and operation in China aroused strong public resentment and led to calls for domestic development of railways.<ref name=WangYong/>  To help local economies develop and retain earnings from railways, the Qing government in 1904 permitted local provinces to organize their own railway companies and raise funds by selling shares to the public.  From 1904\u20131907, 15 provincial governments formed their own railway building companies and raised funds by selling shares to citizens and levying taxes.<ref name=WangYong/>   The [[Jingbao railway|Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway]] built from 1905\u201309, was the first railway to be designed and built indigenously. The chief engineer was [[Zhan Tianyou]], who is known as the Father of China's Railways.  The [[Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway]], 189&nbsp;km in length and completed in 1909, was financed by the provincial governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang.<ref>[http://mikes.railhistory.railfan.net/r076.html Travelling By Train In China<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The Zhengding-Taiyuan Railway, originally planned to run from Zhengding County in Hebei Province, was routed from Shijiazhuang instead and opened in 1907.\n\nIn 1911, when some of the provincial railway ventures fell into bankruptcy, the foreign powers pressed the Qing government to permit them to take over the ventures.<ref name=WangYong/>  In May 1911, the Qing government sought to nationalize these locally controlled railway companies and pledge their railway concessions to foreign banks in exchange for loans.  The nationalization order provoked fierce public opposition that led to the [[Railway Protection Movement]], which contributed to the outbreak of the [[Xinhai Revolution]].  Troops sent to Sichuan from neighboring Hubei weakened defenses in [[Wuhan]] where revolutionaries launched the [[Wuchang Uprising]]. The ensuing [[Xinhai Revolution]] toppled the Qing Dynasty.\n\n==Republic of China==\n{{See also|Rail transport in Taiwan|Taiwan_Railways_Administration#History}}\nAfter founding the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] on January 1, 1912, Dr. [[Sun Yat-sen]] agreed to cede the provisional presidency to Yuan Shikai in exchange for the latter's assistance in securing the abdication of Qing court.  Sun believed that a national railway network was key to the modernization of China.  He sought and received from Yuan Shikai, the portfolio of railway development for the new republic.\n\nFrom 1928 to 1937, the Republican government in Nanjing built 3,600&nbsp;km of railway inside the [[Great Wall]].<ref name=TLNJ/> [[Manchuria]], located beyond the wall, had 900&nbsp;km of railways built from 1928 until 1931, when the [[Mukden Incident|region was captured by Japan]].<ref name=TLNJ/>\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Bombing a chinese railway.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Longhai Railway]] bombed during the Second Sino-Japanese War]]\nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] of 1937\u20131945, the Republican government dismantled a number of railways to slow the Japanese advance and added 1,900&nbsp;km of railways, mostly in the interior of China after coastal regions were occupied.<ref name=TLNJ/>  Among the completed lines were the [[Longhai Railway]] (Lingbao-Tongguan and Xi'an-Baoji sections), Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway (Hangzhou-Pingxiang section) and the Guangdong-Hankou Railway (Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section).<ref name=TLNJ/>  The Shanxi warlord [[Yan Xishan]] built the narrow gauge [[Datong-Puzhou Railway]] across Shanxi Province.  The Japanese occupiers, using forced labor, built 5,700&nbsp;km of railway in [[Manchuria]] and [[Rehe Province]] and 900&nbsp;km of railway in [[China Proper]].<ref name=TLNJ/>\n\nIn 1941, construction began of the [[Yunnan Burma Railway]], an attempt to link British occupied [[Burma]] with [[Kunming]] in [[Yunnan]] province. Ultimately, however, the project was aborted.\n\n===1945-1949===\nIn 1945, just after the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], the Chinese mainland had 27,000&nbsp;km of rail, and it was estimated about 23,000&nbsp;km was usable. By 1948, the number of usable kilometers of rail was estimated at only 8,000&nbsp;km due to the [[Chinese Civil War]]. The [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] actively sabotaged rail lines to disrupt the ruling [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] (Kuomintang), and the Nationalists scavenged lesser used railways in order to repair the most important ones.<ref name=\"GeoRev\">Norton S.

Most of the early reconstruction (about 11,000&nbsp;km) was in Manchuria because [[Manchuria#After World War II|Soviet and Japanese occupation]] there reduced the amount of sabotage between the fighting parties, allowing for quick repairs.<ref name=\"GeoRev\"/>\n\nOn October 14, 1949, the cross-border service on the [[Kowloon-Canton Railway]] was suspended as a result of the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|communist revolution]], and it was not resumed until April 4, 1979.\n[[File:Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge - the railway level.jpg|230px|left|thumb|A train on [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]] - a first fixed railway link across the river]]\nIn fact, when the PRC was established in 1949, China had constructed 27,380&nbsp;km of railway, but only 24,090&nbsp;km was kept, including 10,309&nbsp;km in the northeastern part of China, and 919&nbsp;km in [[Taiwan]].<ref>\u4e2d\u570b\u9435\u8def1863\uff0d1949:\u5728\u611a\u6627\u3001\u5c08\u5236\u3001\u4fb5\u7565\u4e0b\u6399\u624e(\u4e00), \u8881\u5049\u6642</ref>\n\n===Railway construction in the 1950s===\nThe end to decades of warfare in China allowed railway construction to proceed on a large scale.  In the 1950s, the government initiated numerous railway building projects to fill in missing links in the country's rail network.  The new government undertook a vigorous railway building campaign.  From 1952, when the first railway of the People's Republic, the [[Chengdu\u2013Chongqing Railway]] entered operation, to the end of the [[Five-year plans of the People's Republic of China|First Five Year Plan]] in 1957, {{convert|6100|km|mi|0|abbr=off}} of railroads were built, accounting for 18% of the national total.<ref name=TLNJ/> The lines completed during this period include the final sections of the [[Longhai Railway|Longhai]] and [[Hukun Railway|Xianggui]] Railways, the [[Litang\u2013Zhanjiang Railway|Litang\u2013Zhanjiang]], [[Yingtan\u2013Xiamen Railway|Yingtan\u2013Xiamen]], [[Lancun\u2013Yantai Railway|Lancun\u2013Yantai]] and [[Xiaoshan\u2013Ningbo Railway]]s.<ref name=TLNJ/>   These lines, along with the [[Baoji\u2013Chengdu Railway]] (completed in 1958) and the 1,900&nbsp;km [[Lanzhou\u2013Xinjiang Railway]] to [[Urumqi]] (completed in 1962), extended the national rail network to the Northwest and Southwest, and added connections between the coast and interior.<ref name=TLNJ/>\nIn 1957, passenger trains averaged 34.8&nbsp;km/h and freight trains averaged 25.2&nbsp;km/h.<ref name=TLNJ/>\n\n===The Great Leap Forward===\n[[File:China Railroads 1961.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Map of China's railway network in 1961]]\nThe launch of the [[Great Leap Forward]] in 1958 was intended to rapidly expand railway transport, but produced counterproductive results.<ref name=TLNJ/>  The shipment of freight, which was not quite 300 million tons in 1957, was targeted to reach 900 million tons by 1959 and 3 billion tons by 1972.<ref name=TLNJ/>  The length of newly planned railways rose from 20,000&nbsp;km to 70,000, and 120,000&nbsp;km over the next 15 years.<ref name=TLNJ/>  To reach these targets, the railroads were pushed beyond their capacity.<ref name=TLNJ/>\n\nWithout experimentation, freight trains on all major lines increased carrying load from 2,700 tons to 3,600 tons without adding power to locomotives.<ref name=TLNJ/>  This caused trains to backslide on slopes, damage to rolling stock and steam engines to dry boil.<ref name=TLNJ/>  On time rates fell precipitously.<ref name=TLNJ/>  The railways did set new records, 1.4 billion passenger rides and 1.5 billion tons of freight delivered in the three years between 1958 and 1960, some 200 million passengers and 0.5 billion tons more than the five years from 1953 to 1958, but the freight load fell to 345 million tons in 1962.<ref name=TLNJ/>  The economic disclocation caused by the Great Leap Forward slowed down railway construction.  Numerous lines such as the [[Dazhou-Chengdu Railway]] were delayed for decades as a result.\n\nRail operations were revamped in 1961 and performance improved.<ref name=TLNJ/>  In 1965, freight carried reached 480 million tons and the system set a new record for net income.<ref name=TLNJ/>  The [[Sino-Soviet split]] prompted the leadership to shift railway building toward the \"Third Line\", in the mountainous regions of the interior, away from the east coast and Soviet border.\n\n===Cultural Revolution===\nThe launch of the Cultural Revolution in 1966 brought political turmoil to the country and disruptions to railway operations.<ref name=TLNJ/>  In the fall of 1966, by Chairman Mao's edict, the Red Guards from around the country could travel on trains for free.  To prevent political factional fighting to spread into the railways, the national railways were assigned to the command of the military in the summer of 1967.<ref name=TLNJ/>  Railway management and operations, nevertheless, slipped rapidly.<ref name=TLNJ/>  Accident rates rose 25% from 1966 to 1967, and another 20% from 1967 to 1968.<ref name=TLNJ/>  Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] and other moderate leaders pushed back against leftist-radical management of the railway and operations began to improve in 1969.<ref name=TLNJ/>  In 1973, the system shipped 800 million tons, a new record.<ref name=TLNJ/>   In 1974, however, the [[Gang of Four]] with the [[Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius|Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius Campaign]], reasserted the leftist line and railway performance plummted again.<ref name=TLNJ/>  From the summer of 1974 to early 1975, railway hubs in [[Xuzhou]], [[Changsha]], [[Guiyang]], and [[Baotou]] experienced freight bottlenecks.  In April 1975, Deng Xiaoping took control of the leadership and directed the railways to focus on productivity and safety.<ref name=TLNJ/>  In April 1975, the railways' coal carrying targets were met for the first time in nearly five years.<ref name=TLNJ/>  In early 1976, after Deng Xiaoping was removed from power and the Gang of Four reasserted control, railway performance declined again.<ref name=TLNJ/>  Compared to 1975, freight fell by 46.3 million tons year-on-year, accidents rose by 17% and tax revenues paid to the state fell by 740 million.<ref name=TLNJ/>\n\nDespite the turmoil of the [[Cultural Revolution]] and slowdown in rail construction at home, the Chinese Railway Ministry and the Rail Corps managed to build a 1,860&nbsp;km railway across [[Tanzania]] and [[Zambia]].  The [[TAZARA Railway]] was by far the largest foreign aid project undertaken by China in Africa.  As many as 56,000 Chinese engineers and workers were sent overseas from 1968 to 1975.\n\nAfter the Cultural Revolution ended and the [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms]] were launched in 1978, the railways were reorganized and rededicated to improving safety, performance, technology and profitability.<ref name=TLNJ/>  These principles have guided the railway's operations in the decades since.<ref name=TLNJ/>\n\nIn 1998, passenger trains averaged 54.5&nbsp;km/h and freight trains averaged 31.8&nbsp;km/h.<ref name=TLNJ/>\n\n===Slowdown in the 1980s===\nAfter China initiated market-oriented economic reforms in 1978, railway building slowed as state funds were directed toward higher return investments.  It was not until the 1990s, after more than a decade of economic growth, that the state could commit the funds to renew large-scale railway building.\n\n===Railway building boom since 1990===\nIn 1990, the Lanxin Railway was extended by the [[Northern Xinjiang Railway]] to the [[Rail transport in Kazakhstan|Kazakh]] border.  In 1999, the [[Southern Xinjiang Railway]] brought railway service to [[Kashgar]] in the far west.\n\nThe railway to [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]] however, was more difficult to build due to the high altitude and terrain. Rail lines were first extended to [[Xining]] in [[Qinghai]], and by 1984 another section between Xining and [[Golmud]] was completed. It was not until 2006 that the whole of the [[Qingzang railway]] was finished, linking [[Lhasa]] with rest of China. Since then, every province-level entity in the People's Republic of China has a railway network.\n\n===End of the steam era===\n[[File:Train and traffic going to the Great Wall.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A steam locomotive and a diesel locomotive near the [[Badaling]] [[Great Wall]] in Beijing in 1979.]]\nBefore the 1980s, due to the low labor cost, ease of manufacture, and cheap coal price, [[steam locomotive]]s dominated the Chinese railways. During the 1980s and 90s, [[diesel locomotive|diesel]] and [[electric locomotive]]s gradually replaced steam engines on the main lines. On some provincial rails, however, steam locomotives were not retired until the 21st century. In December 2005, the world's last regular revenue mainline steam train finished its journey {{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} on the [[Jitong railway]], marking the end of the steam era. Nevertheless, there are still some steam locomotives used on the industrial railways in China.\n\nAs a part of infrastructure upgrade, China in 2007 opened its first [[China Railway High-speed|high-speed rail]] lines using trains with origins in Canada, France, Germany and Japan.\n\n===Network length table===\n{{Historical populations\n| title= Rail track length\n| percentages = pagr\n| align = center\n| pop_name=km\n| cols = 4\n| source= [http://www.360doc.com/content/11/0924/16/5931940_150892508.shtml \u5386\u53f2\u7edf\u8ba1:\u91d1\u7816\u56fd\u5bb6\u5386\u5e74\u94c1\u8def\u8425\u4e1a\u91cc\u7a0b\u6bd4\u8f83(1838\uff5e2010)]{{bull}}[http://data.stats.gov.cn/search.htm?s=\u94c1\u8def\u8425\u4e1a\u91cc\u7a0b Search for \u94c1\u8def\u8425\u4e1a\u91cc\u7a0b at National Bureau of Statistics of China]/[http://data.stats.gov.cn/easyquery.htm?cn=C01&zb=A0G02 Overview]{{bull}}[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-01/18/c_135021027.htm Facts and figures about China's railway development ({{FormatDate|2016-01-18}})]{{Ref label|notes1|a|}}{{bull}}[http://www.mot.gov.cn/tongjishuju/tielu/201905/P020190530365089148979.pdf 2018 Rail Statistics Public Report]\n| 1948 |12768\n| 1949 |21800\n| 1950 |22200\n| 1951 |22300\n| 1952 |22900\n| 1953 |23800\n| 1954 |24500\n| 1955 |25600\n| 1956 |26500\n| 1957 |26700\n| 1958 |30200\n| 1959 |32300\n| 1960 |33900\n| 1961 |34500\n| 1962 |34600\n| 1963 |35000\n| 1964 |35300\n| 1965 |36400\n| 1966 |37800\n| 1967 |38600\n| 1968 |38800\n| 1969 |39300\n| 1970 |41000\n| 1979 |53000\n| 1980 |53300\n| 1981 |53900\n| 1982 |52900\n| 1983 |54100\n| 1984 |54500\n| 1985 |55000\n| 1986 |55700\n| 1987 |55800\n| 1988 |56100\n| 1989 |56900\n| 1990 |57800\n| 1991 |57800\n| 1992 |58100\n| 1993 |58600\n| 1994 |59000\n| 1995 |62400\n| 1996 |64900\n| 1997 |66000\n| 1998 |66400\n| 1999 |67394\n| 2000 |68700\n| 2001 |70100\n| 2002 |71900\n| 2003 |73000\n| 2004 |74400\n| 2005 |75400\n| 2006 |77100\n| 2007 |77966\n| 2008 |79687\n| 2009 |85818\n| 2010 |90504\n| 2012 |97600\n| 2013 |103144\n| 2014 |111800\n| 2015 |120970\n| 2016 |124000\n| 2017 |127000\n| 2018 |131000\n}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Transport in China]]\n*[[Rail transport in the People's Republic of China]]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311005643/http://www.hkrs.org.hk/  The Chinese Eastern Railway -

Initially, a 10 kilometre (6.2&nbsp;mi) line from [[Tangshan]] to [[Xugezhuang]] built in 1881 to transport coal from the coal mine in Tangshan, this line was extended to [[Tianjin]] in 1888 and [[Shanhaiguan District|Shanhaiguan]] and [[Suizhong]] in 1894. This railway became known as the \"Guanneiwai Railway\" (literally, inner and outer Shanhaiguan railway).  The railway was backed by the powerful [[Viceroy of Zhili]], [[Li Hongzhang]], who overcame objections from conservative ministers.  To secure the support of the [[Empress Dowager]] for railway construction,  Li Hongzhang imported a small train set from Germany and built a {{convert|2|km}} [[narrow gauge]] railway from her residence in [[Zhongnanhai]] to her dining hall in [[Beihai Park|Beihai]] in 1888.<ref name=\"Dong2002p35\">{{cite book |last=Dong| first=Madeleine Yue|editor-first=Joseph W| editor-last=Esherick|title=Remaking the Chinese City: Modernity and National Identity, 1900-1950|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=2002 |pages=35|chapter=Chapter 8: Defining Beiping - Urban Reconstruction and National Identity, 1928-1936|isbn=0-8248-2518-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JYaQ0tsBP30C&pg=PA123&dq=beiping#v=onepage&q=palace%20museum&f=false|ref=Dong 2002}}</ref>  The Empress, concerned that the locomotive's noise would disturb the [[geomancy]] or ''[[fengshui]]'' of the imperial city, required the train be pulled by [[eunuchs]] instead of steam engine.<ref name=\"Dong2002p35\"/>\n\nThe next effort was made by [[Taiwan]] Governor [[Liu Mingchuan]]. From 1887 to 1893, {{convert|107|km}} of railway tracks were laid from [[Keelung]] to [[Taipei]] to [[Hsinchu]]. However, this railway was later demolished for modernization when Taiwan was under [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]].\n\n===Rapid development during 1895-1911===\n[[File:Namitibridge.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Faux Namti Bridge]] on the [[Yunnan\u2013Vietnam Railway]] was built by France in 1906.]]\n[[File:South Manchuria Railway LOC 03283.jpg|thumb|A train on [[South Manchuria Railway]]]]\nQing China's defeat in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] greatly stimulated the railway development as the government both recognized the importance of modernization and was compelled by foreign powers to grant concessions to build railways along with settlement and mineral rights.  The imperial powers then took to building railways in their spheres of influence. The railroads already built in 1900 had a total length of only 292 miles. Another 4000 miles were in the planning stage.<ref>''Appletons' annual cyclopaedia and register of important events of the year 1901'' (1902) p 151.</ref>\n\nThe British built the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway (1905-1908) and [[Kowloon-Canton Railway]] (completed 1911).  The French built the [[Sino-Vietnamese Railway]] (1904\u201310), an 855&nbsp;km {{RailGauge|1000mm}} line to connect Kunming with Vietnam, then a colony of French Indochina.  The Germans built the [[Jiaoji Railway]] in Shandong Province.  British and German industrialists jointly built the [[Tianjin\u2013Pukou Railway]]. The Americans built the [[Canton - Sam Shui Railway]] in Guangdong in 1902-04.  Czarist Russia built the [[China Eastern Railway]] (1897-1901) as a shortcut for the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] and the [[Southern Manchuria Railway]] to [[Port Arthur, China|Port Arthur]].  To prevent domination by bigger powers, the Qing Court gave the rights to the Lugouqiao-Hankou Railway to Belgians.  The Japanese initially received numerous concessions along the coast of Fujian and Guangdong, and built the [[Chao Chow and Swatow Railway]] (1904\u201306).  After winning the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1904, the Japanese took over the southern section of the China Eastern Railway (from Changchun to Port Arthur) and the entire Southern Manchuria Railway.\n\nBy 1911, there were around 9,000&nbsp;km of rails in China. Most of the rails used the {{RailGauge|1435mm|allk=on}}.\n[[File:KCRC early railway network of China.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Map showing early railway expansion in China.]]\n[[File:Hankou-Dazhimen-Station-0238.jpg|right|thumb|Hankou Dazhimen Station, the original southern terminal of the [[Jinghan Railway]]]]\n\nThe imperial capital, [[Beijing]], was designed as the center of the Chinese railway network. Several lines radiated out from Beijing. Three main lines are [[Jingguang railway|Beijing-Hankou Railway]], [[Jingha railway|Beijing-Fengtian Railway]], and [[Tianjin-Pukou Railway]]. Jinghan railway was from eh Beijing to [[Hankou]]. The construction started in 1897 and was completed in 1906. The Guangneiwai railway was extended west to Beijing and east to [[Shenyang|Fengtian]] by 1912 and renamed as Beijing-Fengtian Railway. The Tianjin-Pukou Railway, built from 1908&ndash;1912.  It ran from Tianjin, which was connected by the Beijing-Fengtian Railway, to [[Pukou]] across the Yangtze River from Nanjing.\n\n===Railway protection movement and the Xinhai Revolution===\n{{main|Railway Protection Movement}}\n[[File:Zhangtianyoux.jpg|left|upright|thumbnail|[[Zhan Tianyou]], the \"father of China's railways\"]]\nThe rapid expansion of foreign railroad ownership and operation in China aroused strong public resentment and led to calls for domestic development of railways.<ref name=WangYong/>  To help local economies develop and retain earnings from railways, the Qing government in 1904 permitted local provinces to organize their own railway companies and raise funds by selling shares to the public.  From 1904-1907, 15 provincial governments formed their own railway building companies and raised funds by selling shares to citizens and levying taxes.<ref name=WangYong/>   The [[Jingbao railway|Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway]] built from 1905\u201309, was the first railway to be designed and built indigenously. The chief engineer was [[Zhan Tianyou]], who is known as the Father of China's Railways.  The [[Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway]], 189&nbsp;km in length and completed in 1909, was financed by the provincial governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang.<ref>[http://mikes.railhistory.railfan.net/r076.html Travelling By Train In China<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The Zhengding-Taiyuan Railway, originally planned to run from Zhengding County in Hebei Province, was routed from Shijiazhuang instead and opened in 1907.\n\nIn 1911, when some of the provincial railway ventures fell into bankruptcy, the foreign powers pressed the Qing government to permit them to take over the ventures.<ref name=WangYong/>  In May 1911, the Qing government sought to nationalize these locally controlled railway companies and pledge their railway concessions to foreign banks in exchange for loans.  The nationalization order provoked fierce public opposition that led to the [[Railway Protection Movement]], which contributed to the outbreak of the [[Xinhai Revolution]].  Troops sent to Sichuan from neighboring Hubei weakened defenses in [[Wuhan]] where revolutionaries launched the [[Wuchang Uprising]]. The ensuing [[Xinhai Revolution]] toppled the Qing Dynasty.\n\n==Republic of China==\n{{See also|Rail transport in Taiwan|Taiwan_Railways_Administration#History}}\nAfter founding the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] on January 1, 1912, Dr. [[Sun Yat-sen]] agreed to cede the provisional presidency to Yuan Shikai in exchange for the latter's assistance in securing the abdication of Qing court.  Sun believed that a national railway network was key to the modernization of China.  He sought and received from Yuan Shikai, the portfolio of railway development for the new republic.\n\nFrom 1928 to 1937, the Republican government in Nanjing built 3,600&nbsp;km of railway inside the [[Great Wall]].<ref name=TLNJ/> [[Manchuria]], located beyond the wall, had 900&nbsp;km of railways built from 1928 until 1931, when the [[Mukden Incident|region was captured by Japan]].<ref name=TLNJ/>\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Bombing a chinese railway.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Longhai Railway]] bombed during the Second Sino-Japanese War]]\nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] of 1937-1945, the Republican government dismantled a number of railways to slow the Japanese advance and added 1,900&nbsp;km of railways, mostly in the interior of China after coastal regions were occupied.<ref name=TLNJ/>  Among the completed lines were the [[Longhai Railway]] (Lingbao-Tongguan and Xi'an-Baoji sections), Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway (Hangzhou-Pingxiang section) and the Guangdong-Hankou Railway (Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section).<ref name=TLNJ/>  The Shanxi warlord [[Yan Xishan]] built the narrow gauge [[Datong-Puzhou Railway]] across Shanxi Province.

Ultimately, however, the project was aborted.\n\n===1945-1949===\nIn 1945, just after the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], the Chinese mainland had 27,000&nbsp;km of rail, and it was estimated about 23,000&nbsp;km was usable. By 1948, the number of usable kilometers of rail was estimated at only 8,000&nbsp;km due to the [[Chinese Civil War]]. The [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] actively sabotaged rail lines to disrupt the ruling [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] (Kuomintang), and the Nationalists scavenged lesser used railways in order to repair the most important ones.<ref name=\"GeoRev\">Norton S.

Most of the early reconstruction (about 11,000&nbsp;km) was in Manchuria because [[Manchuria#After World War II|Soviet and Japanese occupation]] there reduced the amount of sabotage between the fighting parties, allowing for quick repairs.<ref name=\"GeoRev\"/>\n\nOn October 14, 1949, the cross-border service on the [[Kowloon-Canton Railway]] was suspended as a result of the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|communist revolution]], and it was not resumed until April 4, 1979.\n[[File:Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge - the railway level.jpg|230px|left|thumb|A train on [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]] - a first fixed railway link across the river]]\nIn fact, when the PRC was established in 1949, China had constructed 27,380&nbsp;km of railway, but only 24,090&nbsp;km was kept, including 10,309&nbsp;km in the northeastern part of China, and 919&nbsp;km in [[Taiwan]].<ref>\u4e2d\u570b\u9435\u8def1863\uff0d1949:\u5728\u611a\u6627\u3001\u5c08\u5236\u3001\u4fb5\u7565\u4e0b\u6399\u624e(\u4e00), \u8881\u5049\u6642</ref>\n\n===Railway construction in the 1950s===\nThe end to decades of warfare in China allowed railway construction to proceed on a large scale.  In the 1950s, the government initiated numerous railway building projects to fill in missing links in the country's rail network.  The new government undertook a vigorous railway building campaign.  From 1952, when the first railway of the People's Republic, the [[Chengdu\u2013Chongqing Railway]] entered operation, to the end of the [[Five-year plans of the People's Republic of China|First Five Year Plan]] in 1957, {{convert|6100|km|mi|0|abbr=off}} of railroads were built, accounting for 18% of the national total.<ref name=TLNJ/> The lines completed during this period include the final sections of the [[Longhai Railway|Longhai]] and [[Hukun Railway|Xianggui]] Railways, the [[Litang\u2013Zhanjiang Railway|Litang\u2013Zhanjiang]], [[Yingtan\u2013Xiamen Railway|Yingtan\u2013Xiamen]], [[Lancun\u2013Yantai Railway|Lancun\u2013Yantai]] and [[Xiaoshan\u2013Ningbo Railway]]s.<ref name=TLNJ/>   These lines, along with the [[Baoji\u2013Chengdu Railway]] (completed in 1958) and the 1,900&nbsp;km [[Lanzhou\u2013Xinjiang Railway]] to [[Urumqi]] (completed in 1962), extended the national rail network to the Northwest and Southwest, and added connections between the coast and interior.<ref name=TLNJ/>\nIn 1957, passenger trains averaged 34.8&nbsp;km/h and freight trains averaged 25.2&nbsp;km/h.<ref name=TLNJ/>\n\n===The Great Leap Forward===\n[[File:China Railroads 1961.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Map of China's railway network in 1961]]\nThe launch of the [[Great Leap Forward]] in 1958 was intended to rapidly expand railway transport, but produced counterproductive results.<ref name=TLNJ/>  The shipment of freight, which was not quite 300 million tons in 1957, was targeted to reach 900 million tons by 1959 and 3 billion tons by 1972.<ref name=TLNJ/>  The length of newly planned railways rose from 20,000&nbsp;km to 70,000, and 120,000&nbsp;km over the next 15 years.<ref name=TLNJ/>  To reach these targets, the railroads were pushed beyond their capacity.<ref name=TLNJ/>\n\nWithout experimentation, freight trains on all major lines increased carrying load from 2,700 tons to 3,600 tons without adding power to locomotives.<ref name=TLNJ/>  This caused trains to backslide on slopes, damage to rolling stock and steam engines to dry boil.<ref name=TLNJ/>  On time rates fell precipitously.<ref name=TLNJ/>  The railways did set new records, 1.4 billion passenger rides and 1.5 billion tons of freight delivered in the three years between 1958 and 1960, some 200 million passengers and 0.5 billion tons more than the five years from 1953 to 1958, but the freight load fell to 345 million tons in 1962.<ref name=TLNJ/>  The economic disclocation caused by the Great Leap Forward slowed down railway construction.  Numerous lines such as the [[Dazhou-Chengdu Railway]] were delayed for decades as a result.\n\nRail operations were revamped in 1961 and performance improved.<ref name=TLNJ/>  In 1965, freight carried reached 480 million tons and the system set a new record for net income.<ref name=TLNJ/>  The [[Sino-Soviet split]] prompted the leadership to shift railway building toward the \"Third Line\", in the mountainous regions of the interior, away from the east coast and Soviet border.\n\n===Cultural Revolution===\nThe launch of the Cultural Revolution in 1966 brought political turmoil to the country and disruptions to railway operations.<ref name=TLNJ/>  In the fall of 1966, by Chairman Mao's edict, the Red Guards from around the country could travel on trains for free.  To prevent political factional fighting to spread into the railways, the national railways were assigned to the command of the military in the summer of 1967.<ref name=TLNJ/>  Railway management and operations, nevertheless, slipped rapidly.<ref name=TLNJ/>  Accident rates rose 25% from 1966 to 1967, and another 20% from 1967 to 1968.<ref name=TLNJ/>  Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] and other moderate leaders pushed back against leftist-radical management of the railway and operations began to improve in 1969.<ref name=TLNJ/>  In 1973, the system shipped 800 million tons, a new record.<ref name=TLNJ/>   In 1974, however, the [[Gang of Four]] with the [[Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius|Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius Campaign]], reasserted the leftist line and railway performance plummted again.<ref name=TLNJ/>  From the summer of 1974 to early 1975, railway hubs in [[Xuzhou]], [[Changsha]], [[Guiyang]], and [[Baotou]] experienced freight bottlenecks.  In April 1975, Deng Xiaoping took control of the leadership and directed the railways to focus on productivity and safety.<ref name=TLNJ/>  In April 1975, the railways' coal carrying targets were met for the first time in nearly five years.<ref name=TLNJ/>  In early 1976, after Deng Xiaoping was removed from power and the Gang of Four reasserted control, railway performance declined again.<ref name=TLNJ/>  Compared to 1975, freight fell by 46.3 million tons year-on-year, accidents rose by 17% and tax revenues paid to the state fell by 740 million.<ref name=TLNJ/>\n\nDespite the turmoil of the [[Cultural Revolution]] and slowdown in rail construction at home, the Chinese Railway Ministry and the Rail Corps managed to build a 1,860&nbsp;km railway across [[Tanzania]] and [[Zambia]].  The [[TAZARA Railway]] was by far the largest foreign aid project undertaken by China in Africa.  As many as 56,000 Chinese engineers and workers were sent overseas from 1968 to 1975.\n\nAfter the Cultural Revolution ended and the [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms]] were launched in 1978, the railways were reorganized and rededicated to improving safety, performance, technology and profitability.<ref name=TLNJ/>  These principles have guided the railway's operations in the decades since.<ref name=TLNJ/>\n\nIn 1998, passenger trains averaged 54.5&nbsp;km/h and freight trains averaged 31.8&nbsp;km/h.<ref name=TLNJ/>\n\n===Slowdown in the 1980s===\nAfter China initiated market-oriented economic reforms in 1978, railway building slowed as state funds were directed toward higher return investments.  It was not until the 1990s, after more than a decade of economic growth, that the state could commit the funds to renew large-scale railway building.\n\n===Railway building boom since 1990===\nIn 1990, the Lanxin Railway was extended by the [[Northern Xinjiang Railway]] to the [[Rail transport in Kazakhstan|Kazakh]] border.  In 1999, the [[Southern Xinjiang Railway]] brought railway service to [[Kashgar]] in the far west.\n\nThe railway to [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]] however, was more difficult to build due to the high altitude and terrain. Rail lines were first extended to [[Xining]] in [[Qinghai]], and by 1984 another section between Xining and [[Golmud]] was completed. It was not until 2006 that the whole of the [[Qingzang railway]] was finished, linking [[Lhasa]] with rest of China. Since then, every province-level entity in the People's Republic of China has a railway network.\n\n===End of the steam era===\n[[File:Train and traffic going to the Great Wall.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A steam locomotive and a diesel locomotive near the [[Badaling]] [[Great Wall]] in Beijing in 1979.]]\nBefore the 1980s, due to the low labor cost, ease of manufacture, and cheap coal price, [[steam locomotive]]s dominated the Chinese railways. During the 1980s and 90s, [[diesel locomotive|diesel]] and [[electric locomotive]]s gradually replaced steam engines on the main lines. On some provincial rails, however, steam locomotives were not retired until the 21st century. In December 2005, the world's last regular revenue mainline steam train finished its journey {{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} on the [[Jitong railway]], marking the end of the steam era. Nevertheless, there are still some steam locomotives used on the industrial railways in China.\n\nAs a part of infrastructure upgrade, China in 2007 opened its first [[China Railway High-speed|high-speed rail]] lines using trains with origins in Canada, France, Germany and Japan.\n\n===Network length table===\n{{Historical populations\n| title= Rail track length\n| percentages = pagr\n| align = center\n| pop_name=km\n| cols = 4\n| source= [http://www.360doc.com/content/11/0924/16/5931940_150892508.shtml \u5386\u53f2\u7edf\u8ba1:\u91d1\u7816\u56fd\u5bb6\u5386\u5e74\u94c1\u8def\u8425\u4e1a\u91cc\u7a0b\u6bd4\u8f83(1838\uff5e2010)]{{bull}}[http://data.stats.gov.cn/search.htm?s=\u94c1\u8def\u8425\u4e1a\u91cc\u7a0b Search for \u94c1\u8def\u8425\u4e1a\u91cc\u7a0b at National Bureau of Statistics of China]/[http://data.stats.gov.cn/easyquery.htm?cn=C01&zb=A0G02 Overview]{{bull}}[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-01/18/c_135021027.htm Facts and figures about China's railway development ({{FormatDate|2016-01-18}})]{{Ref label|notes1|a|}}{{bull}}[http://www.mot.gov.cn/tongjishuju/tielu/201905/P020190530365089148979.pdf 2018 Rail Statistics Public Report]\n| 1948 |12768\n| 1949 |21800\n| 1950 |22200\n| 1951 |22300\n| 1952 |22900\n| 1953 |23800\n| 1954 |24500\n| 1955 |25600\n| 1956 |26500\n| 1957 |26700\n| 1958 |30200\n| 1959 |32300\n| 1960 |33900\n| 1961 |34500\n| 1962 |34600\n| 1963 |35000\n| 1964 |35300\n| 1965 |36400\n| 1966 |37800\n| 1967 |38600\n| 1968 |38800\n| 1969 |39300\n| 1970 |41000\n| 1979 |53000\n| 1980 |53300\n| 1981 |53900\n| 1982 |52900\n| 1983 |54100\n| 1984 |54500\n| 1985 |55000\n| 1986 |55700\n| 1987 |55800\n| 1988 |56100\n| 1989 |56900\n| 1990 |57800\n| 1991 |57800\n| 1992 |58100\n| 1993 |58600\n| 1994 |59000\n| 1995 |62400\n| 1996 |64900\n| 1997 |66000\n| 1998 |66400\n| 1999 |67394\n| 2000 |68700\n| 2001 |70100\n| 2002 |71900\n| 2003 |73000\n| 2004 |74400\n| 2005 |75400\n| 2006 |77100\n| 2007 |77966\n| 2008 |79687\n| 2009 |85818\n| 2010 |90504\n| 2012 |97600\n| 2013 |103144\n| 2014 |111800\n| 2015 |120970\n| 2016 |124000\n| 2017 |127000\n| 2018 |131000\n}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Transport in China]]\n*[[Rail transport in the People's Republic of China]]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070311005643/http://www.hkrs.org.hk/  The Chinese Eastern Railway -

({{lang-fr|'''Paris br\u00fble-t-il ?'''}}) is a 1966 French-American [[Epic film|epic]] [[Historical drama|historical]] [[war film]] about the [[liberation of Paris]] in August 1944 by the [[French Resistance]] and the [[Free French Forces]] during [[World War II]]. A French-American co-production, it is directed by French filmmaker [[Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment]], with a screenplay by [[Gore Vidal]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Jean Aurenche]], [[Pierre Bost]], and Claude Brul\u00e9; adapted from [[Is Paris Burning? (book)|the book of the same title]] by [[Larry Collins (writer)|Larry Collins]] and [[Dominique Lapierre]]. The film stars an international [[ensemble cast]] that includes French ([[Jean-Paul Belmondo]], [[Alain Delon]], [[Bruno Cremer]], [[Pierre Vaneck]], [[Jean-Pierre Cassel]], [[Leslie Caron]], [[Charles Boyer]], [[Yves Montand]]), American ([[Orson Welles]], [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Glenn Ford]], [[Robert Stack]], [[Anthony Perkins]], [[George Chakiris]]), and German ([[Gert Fr\u00f6be]], [[Hannes Messemer]], [[Ernst Fritz F\u00fcrbringer]], [[Harry Meyen]]) stars.\n\nThe film was released in France on October 26, 1966 and in the United States on November 10, 1966. It received general positive reviews, and was the fourth most popular movie of the year in France in 1966.<ref name=\"delon\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> It was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography (Black and White)]] and [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Academy Award for Best Art Direction]] at the [[40th Academy Awards]], and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]].\n\n==Plot==\nShortly after the failed [[20 July plot]] to assassinate him in 1944, [[Adolf Hitler]], appoints ''[[General der Infanterie]]'' [[Dietrich von Choltitz]] as military governor of occupied Paris. Hitler believes Choltitz will obey his order that [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]] should not be allowed to capture Paris without the Germans destroying it completely, similar to the [[planned destruction of Warsaw]].\n\nThe [[French Resistance]] learn that the Allies are not planning to take Paris, but are heading straight to Germany instead. The two factions within the Resistance react to this news differently. The [[Gaullism|Gaullists]] under [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]] want to wait and see, while the [[French Communist Party|Communists]] under Colonel [[Rol-Tanguy]] want to take action. The Communists force the issue by calling for a general uprising by the citizens of Paris and by occupying important government buildings. The Gaullists go along with this plan of action once it is set in motion.\n\nInitially, Choltitz is intent on following Hitler's order to level the city. After his troops fail to dislodge the Resistance from the [[Prefecture of Police of Paris|Prefecture of Police]], he orders the [[Luftwaffe]] to bomb the building but withdraws the order at the urging of the Swedish Consul, [[Raoul Nordling]], who points out that bombs that miss the Prefecture risk destroying nearby culturally invaluable buildings such as the [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral]]. Choltitz accepts a truce offer from the Resistance (conceived by the Gaullist faction), but the Communists want to keep on fighting, in spite of a lack of ammunition. The truce is, therefore, shortened to one day and the fighting resumes.\n\nAfter learning that the Germans plan to destroy Paris (the [[Eiffel Tower]] and other landmarks are rigged with explosives), a messenger from the Resistance is sent across enemy lines to contact the Americans. He informs the Allies that the Resistance has already taken control of parts of the city and implores them to provide support to prevent the uprising being crushed as was [[Warsaw Uprising|then happening in Warsaw]]. He adds that France would never forgive the destruction of Paris. Afterwards General [[Omar Bradley]] gives the [[2nd Armored Division (France)|2nd Armored Division]] under General [[Philippe Leclerc]] the go-ahead to rush on Paris.\n\nAs the military situation deteriorates, Choltitz delays the order to destroy Paris, believing that Hitler is insane and that the war is lost, making the destruction of Paris a futile gesture. He chooses instead to surrender shortly after the Allies enter the city.\n\nAs the Free French Forces and De Gaulle [[Liberation of Paris|parade down]] the streets of Paris, greeted by cheering crowds, a phone receiver off the hook is seen with a voice in German repeatedly asking \"Is Paris burning?\" From the air, Paris is seen, its buildings still intact and standing, followed by a sudden switch from black and white to color.\n\n==Cast==\n==== French resistance ====\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]] as Yvon \"Pierrelot\" Morandat, [[Free France|Free French]] adjunct\n* [[Alain Delon]] as [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]], [[Gaullism|Gaullist]] [[general of brigade]]\n* [[Bruno Cremer]] as Col.

According to screenwriter [[Francis Ford Coppola]], the film's production was strictly controlled by [[Charles de Gaulle]]. The latter would only permit location filming in Paris (which was, of course, crucial) if his rules were obeyed to the letter. In particular, he was anxious to minimize the part played in the Liberation by the French Communist Party; it was, said Coppola, blatant political censorship.\n\nClaude Rich plays two parts: General [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque|Leclerc]], with a moustache, and Lt.

({{lang-fr|'''Paris br\u00fble-t-il ?'''}}) is a 1966 [[Epic film|epic]] [[Historical film|historical]] [[war film]] about the [[liberation of Paris]] in August 1944 by the [[French Resistance]] and the [[Free French Forces]] during [[World War II]]. A French-American co-production, it is directed by French filmmaker [[Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment]], with a screenplay by [[Gore Vidal]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Jean Aurenche]], [[Pierre Bost]], and Claude Brul\u00e9; adapted from [[Is Paris Burning? (book)|the book of the same title]] by [[Larry Collins (writer)|Larry Collins]] and [[Dominique Lapierre]]. The film stars an international [[ensemble cast]] that includes French ([[Jean-Paul Belmondo]], [[Alain Delon]], [[Bruno Cremer]], [[Pierre Vaneck]], [[Jean-Pierre Cassel]], [[Leslie Caron]], [[Charles Boyer]], [[Yves Montand]]), American ([[Orson Welles]], [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Glenn Ford]], [[Robert Stack]], [[Anthony Perkins]], [[George Chakiris]]), and German ([[Gert Fr\u00f6be]], [[Hannes Messemer]], [[Ernst Fritz F\u00fcrbringer]], [[Harry Meyen]]) stars.\n\nThe film was released in France on October 26, 1966 and in the United States on November 10, 1966. It received general positive reviews, and was the fourth most popular movie of the year in France in 1966.<ref name=\"delon\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> It was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography (Black and White)]] and [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Academy Award for Best Art Direction]] at the [[40th Academy Awards]], and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]].\n\n==Plot==\nShortly after the failed [[20 July plot]] to assassinate him in 1944, [[Adolf Hitler]], appoints ''[[General der Infanterie]]'' [[Dietrich von Choltitz]] as military governor of occupied Paris. Hitler believes Choltitz will obey his order that [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]] should not be allowed to capture Paris without the Germans destroying it completely, similar to the [[planned destruction of Warsaw]].\n\nThe [[French Resistance]] learn that the Allies are not planning to take Paris, but are heading straight to Germany instead. The two factions within the Resistance react to this news differently. The [[Gaullism|Gaullists]] under [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]] want to wait and see, while the [[French Communist Party|Communists]] under Colonel [[Rol-Tanguy]] want to take action. The Communists force the issue by calling for a general uprising by the citizens of Paris and by occupying important government buildings. The Gaullists go along with this plan of action once it is set in motion.\n\nInitially, Choltitz is intent on following Hitler's order to level the city. After his troops fail to dislodge the Resistance from the [[Prefecture of Police of Paris|Prefecture of Police]], he orders the [[Luftwaffe]] to bomb the building but withdraws the order at the urging of the Swedish Consul, [[Raoul Nordling]], who points out that bombs that miss the Prefecture risk destroying nearby culturally invaluable buildings such as the [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral]]. Choltitz accepts a truce offer from the Resistance (conceived by the Gaullist faction), but the Communists want to keep on fighting, in spite of a lack of ammunition. The truce is, therefore, shortened to one day and the fighting resumes.\n\nAfter learning that the Germans plan to destroy Paris (the [[Eiffel Tower]] and other landmarks are rigged with explosives), a messenger from the Resistance is sent across enemy lines to contact the Americans. He informs the Allies that the Resistance has already taken control of parts of the city and implores them to provide support to prevent the uprising being crushed as was [[Warsaw Uprising|then happening in Warsaw]]. He adds that France would never forgive the destruction of Paris. Afterwards General [[Omar Bradley]] gives the [[2nd Armored Division (France)|2nd Armored Division]] under General [[Philippe Leclerc]] the go-ahead to rush on Paris.\n\nAs the military situation deteriorates, Choltitz delays the order to destroy Paris, believing that Hitler is insane and that the war is lost, making the destruction of Paris a futile gesture. He chooses instead to surrender shortly after the Allies enter the city.\n\nAs the Free French Forces and De Gaulle [[Liberation of Paris|parade down]] the streets of Paris, greeted by cheering crowds, a phone receiver off the hook is seen with a voice in German repeatedly asking \"Is Paris burning?\" From the air, Paris is seen, its buildings still intact and standing, followed by a sudden switch from black and white to color.\n\n==Cast==\n==== French resistance ====\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]] as Yvon \"Pierrelot\" Morandat, [[Free France|Free French]] adjunct\n* [[Alain Delon]] as [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]], [[Gaullism|Gaullist]] [[general of brigade]]\n* [[Bruno Cremer]] as Col.
