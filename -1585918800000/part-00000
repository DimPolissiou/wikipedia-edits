It was featured on the band's ''[[Daylight Again]]'' album and was released as a single in September 1982. Stephen Stills sings lead vocals throughout, with [[Graham Nash]] joining the second verse. Because David Crosby did not reunite with Stills and Nash until the album was well underway, his vocals are not featured on the album version of the song, although he did appear in the video and subsequently sang the song with the group in live performances. The single was a success on the charts, reaching #18 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three weeks in late November and early December 1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1982-11-20|title=Music: Top 100 Songs - Billboard Hot 100 Chart|website=Billboard.com|accessdate=11 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1982-12-04|title=Music: Top 100 Songs - Billboard Hot 100 Chart|website=Billboard.com|accessdate=11 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Composition and music==\n\"Southern Cross\" is based on the song \"Seven League Boots\" by Rick and Michael Curtis.

The episode aired on March 2, 2020 on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]], in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service [[Netflix]] in several countries.\n\nThe episode centers on [[Saul Goodman|Jimmy McGill]] ([[Bob Odenkirk]]) being forced to use his fast-talking \"Saul Goodman\" legal personality to arrange for the release of Domingo Molina (Max Arciniega) from prison at the request of [[Lalo Salamanca]] ([[Tony Dalton]]), while [[Kim Wexler]] ([[Rhea Seehorn]]) is pulled off her ''[[pro bono]]'' public defense work to deal with a stubborn client for the Mesa Verde bank. The episode features the guest appearance of ''Breaking Bad'' star [[Dean Norris]] reprising his role as DEA agent [[Hank Schrader]], along with [[Steven Michael Quezada]] as Hank's partner Steven Gomez. Showrunner [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] brought the character of Hank back to help drive the transformation of Jimmy into Saul.\n\nThe episode was well-received by critics.\n\n== Plot ==\nNacho takes a nervous Jimmy to Lalo, who knows of Jimmy's reputation from his cousin Tuco.{{efn|As shown in episode \"[[Mijo]]\"}} Lalo wants Jimmy to get Domingo out of jail by giving the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] information on Gus's [[dead drop]]s. Jimmy quotes Lalo what Jimmy believes is an exorbitant fee, and is surprised when Lalo readily pays in advance and in cash. He tells Kim he had a good day financially, but does not disclose any details.\n\nMike gets drunk at the bar he once visited with Werner,{{efn|As shown in episode \"[[Coushatta (Better Call Saul)|Coushatta]]\"}} and demands that the bartender take down a postcard of the [[Sydney Opera House]], which reminds him of Werner because he knows Werner's father worked on it.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tv.avclub.com/jimmy-tangles-with-some-familiar-adversaries-and-bette-1842010779 |title=Jimmy tangles with some familiar adversaries, and Better Call Saul's big bosses pull the strings |first=Donna |last=Bowman |date=March 2, 2020 |accessdate=March 3, 2020 |work=[[The A.V.

Manuel accuses Nacho of arranging the deal to help Manuel steer clear of the drug business.  He refuses to accept and says he will not flee.  He goes on to tell Nacho that if Nacho is in trouble, then Nacho should decide for himself whether to flee or turn himself in to police.\n\nJimmy meets with Domingo in jail and explains Lalo's plan. When DEA agents [[Hank Schrader]] and Steve Gomez arrive to interview Domingo, Jimmy steps in as Domingo's lawyer Saul Goodman, arranging for Domingo to be released and protected as a personal [[Confidential informant]] for Hank in exchange for Gus's dead drop locations. Jimmy reports the results of the interaction to Lalo, who is pleased, while Nacho warns Jimmy that once he begins working for drug dealers like the Salamancas, there is no turning back: \"Once you're in, you're in.\" That night, Nacho reports Domingo's release to Gus and explains Lalo's plan for the dead drops. An unhappy Gus decides to maintain the dead drops, because doing otherwise would reveal to Lalo that someone is providing inside information about the Salamancas. Gus is visibly frustrated and angry because leaving the dead drops to be found by police will cost him at least a half million dollars.\n\nKim has a full day of ''pro bono'' cases, but Rich demands she take care of pressing Mesa Verde business. A [[Tucumcari]] homeowner, Everett Acker, is refusing to leave property leased from the bank so that the bank can begin construction of a new [[call center]]. When Acker refuses a compromise and insults Kim, she argues with him and says he has no choice. Paige and the bank representatives are happy with her hard line approach, but Kim is troubled. On her way home, she turns around and returns to Tucumcari.  She approaches Acker sympathetically, tries to convince him to move, and offers to help him herself. Acker rejects her offer, and tells her she will say whatever is necessary to get what she wants. Kim vents her frustrations by throwing beer bottles from her balcony with Jimmy.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Dean_Norris_by_Gage_Skidmore_2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Dean Norris]] reprises his ''Breaking Bad'' role of [[Hank Schrader]].]]\nThis episode features the appearance of [[Dean Norris]] reprising his starring role on ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' as DEA agent [[Hank Schrader]], along with [[Steven Michael Quezada]] reprising Hank's partner Steven Gomez; Norris is the first of the leading cast credited through the entirety of ''Breaking Bad''{{'}}s run to appear on ''Better Call Saul''.{{efn|While [[Bob Odenkirk]], [[Giancarlo Esposito]] and [[Jonathan Banks]] were all main cast in ''Breaking Bad'', they were not credited as such until the third season.}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2020/03/02/dean-norris-breaking-bad-dea-agent-better-call-saul/4895744002/ |title=Exclusive: Dean Norris on revisiting his 'Breaking Bad' character on 'Better Call Saul' |first=Bill |last=Keveney |date=March 2, 2020 |accessdate=March 3, 2020 |work=[[USA Today]] }}</ref> When ''Better Call Saul'' was first in development, Norris had been unavailable due to starring in ''[[Under the Dome (TV series)|Under the Dome]]'' but expressed interest in returning.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://arts.nationalpost.com/2014/07/03/dean-norris-says-appearance-on-better-call-saul-unlikely-cbs-exec-les-moonves-wont-let-me-do-it/ |title=Dean Norris says appearance on Better Call Saul unlikely: CBS, exec Les Moonves 'won't let me do it' |work=[[The National Post]] |date=July 3, 2014 |accessdate=July 3, 2014 |author=Dekel, Jonathan |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140707075719/http://arts.nationalpost.com/2014/07/03/dean-norris-says-appearance-on-better-call-saul-unlikely-cbs-exec-les-moonves-wont-let-me-do-it/ |archivedate=July 7, 2014}}</ref> Norris said that he and showrunner [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] had spoken many times before of bringing Hank back for ''Better Call Saul'', though Norris said to Gould, \"Just don't let it be a gratuitous return, just to say he's in it.\"<ref name=\"ew norris\">{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/tv/breaking-bad-dean-norris-on-hank-return-better-call-saul/ |title=Breaking Bad vet Dean Norris breaks down Hank's return on Better Call Saul |first1=Dan |last1=Snierson |date=March 3, 2020 |accessdate=March 3, 2020 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] }}</ref> Norris said that Gould wanted to have Hank come back to have some part in the transformation of Jimmy McGill into Saul Goodman so that Hank's appearance was not gratuitous.<ref name=\"ew norris\"/> Gould himself spoke of the need to have \"some very smart law enforcement people who are worthy opponents\" for Jimmy that would push him into using the Saul Goodman persona even deeper without necessarily recognizing the full consequences of those actions, and thus where it made sense to bring in Norris to play Hank.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thewrap.com/better-call-saul-showrunner-breaks-down-why-breaking-bad-prequel-needed-hank-schrader/ |title=\u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Showrunner Breaks Down Why \u2018Breaking Bad\u2019 Prequel Needed Hank Schrader |first=Tim |last=Baysinger |date=March 2, 2020 |accessdate=March 3, 2020 |work=[[The Wrap]] }}</ref> Norris found it easy to fall back into character, particularly as the version of Hank prior to his [[PTSD]] from killing Tuco in \"[[Grilled (Breaking Bad)|Grilled]]\", as well as acting alongside Quezada, who he has remained friends with since their ''Breaking Bad'' days.<ref name=\"ew norris\"/>\n\nThe show opens and closes on scenes involving a mass of ants swarming over an ice cream cone that Jimmy dropped when he was picked up by Nacho.

{"title_page": "Wirral Railway", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe '''Wirral Railway''' was a railway network in the northern part of the [[Wirral Peninsula]], England. It was incorporated in 1863 as the '''Hoylake Railway''', running from [[Hoylake]] to [[Birkenhead]] Docks. After changes of name and of ownership, it was purchased by the Wirral Railway Company Limited in 1884. The network was extended to [[West Kirby]], [[New Brighton, Merseyside|New Brighton]], and [[Seacombe]], and to Birkenhead Park station where it joined the [[Mersey Railway]], enabling through trains through the Mersey Railway Tunnel to [[Liverpool]]. In the [[Railways Act 1921|1923 grouping]] the Wirral company became part of the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]], which electrified the line (except the Seacombe branch) in 1938, allowing passenger services to be integrated with the Liverpool urban system. Most of the Wirral Railway network is still in use today as part of the [[Wirral Line]] of the [[Merseyrail]] commuter rail network.\n\n==Hoylake Railway==\n[[File:Wirral rly.png|thumb|System map of the Wirral Railway]]The [[Chester and Birkenhead Railway]] opened on 23 September 1840.<ref group = note>Gahan; Maund says 22 September on page 6.</ref> This was the first penetration of the Wirral by a railway, and for some years no further attempt was made to build in the peninsula.<ref name = gahan>John W Gahan, ''Steel Wheels to Deeside: The Wirral Railway Past and Present'', Countyvise Limited, Birkenhead, 1983, {{ISBN|0 907768 70 9}}</ref><ref name = maund>T B Maund, ''The Wirral Railway and its Predecessors'', Lightmoor Press, Lydney, 2009, {{ISBN|978 1899 889 389}}</ref>\n\nObserving the success of the [[Liverpool, Crosby and Southport Railway]] in encouraging residential building, and travel, a group of business people led by Braithwaite Pool, a career railwayman, proposed a railway, to be called the Hoylake Railway. It was to connect Hoylake with Birkenhead. The route was soon modified to connect Seacombe (instead of Birkenhead) to Hoylake, with a branch from [[Bidston]] to [[Wallasey]] Bridge Road to serve Birkenhead docks. Parliamentary powers were obtained on 28 July 1863.<ref name = gahan/><ref name = robinson>H A Robinson, ''The Wirral Railway, Old and New'', in the Railway Magazine, April 1938</ref> Authorised capital was \u00a3100,000 with \u00a333,000 in permitted borrowing.<ref name = maund/>\n\nThe Hoylake company desposited further Bills in quick succession, showing a desire to reach far beyond the initial area and break the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR) and [[London and North Western Railway]] (LNWR) duopoly in the Wirral; these proposals included a long viaduct over the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]] to [[Mostyn]]. All the Bills were heavily cut back or rejected.<ref name = maund/>\n\nIn the event the Seacombe portion of the line was not built at this stage as it would have been particularly expensive. Accordingly the railway was constructed as a single line from Hoylake to Wallasey Bridge Road only, a distance of just over five miles. It was inspected by Captain Ritchie of the [[Board of Trade (Privy Council)|Board of Trade]] on 16 June 1866 and was opened to traffic on Monday 18 June 1866. However this apparently did not result in a regular train service until 2 July 1866, following a further inspection by Ritchie on that date.<ref name = maund/> There were six trains a day, four on Sundays, running from \"Birkenhead Docks\" (i.e. Wallasey Bridge Road) to Hoylake; an omnibus connection was operate to Seacombe.<ref name = gahan/><ref name = mercer>Basil Mercer, ''The Wirral Railway'', in the Railway Magazine, July 1914</ref><ref name = maund/> \"All the stations were of the most elementary type, having cinder platforms very scantily supplied with buildings, a state of affairs which in the case of the intermediate stations has persisted to the time of electrification.\"<ref name = robinson/>\n\n==Financial performance==\nAlthough passenger business was very brisk at first, this soon tailed off and the financial performance of the company was very poor, and the train service was reduced. Robinson wrote: \"The building of the line was premature, however. Hoylake in those days was a small fishing village and the rest of the coast quite undeveloped, and it was soon found that the traffic was too small to make it a paying concern.<ref name = robinson/> Money was also owing from the construction of the line, and a Mr Vyner of Bidston had not been paid for land the company had acquired from him; the debt was \u00a39,000, which the company did not have at its disposal; indeed its other liabilities amounted to \u00a320,000. He was able to arrange for bailiffs to seize part of the line at the eastern end of the network, and traffic had to be suspended.<ref name = gahan/>\n\nIt was reported:\n\n<blockquote>Sale of a Railway: ln pursuance of a [[Court of Chancery|Chancery]] decree, obtained by Mr. Robert Vyner, who has never been paid for his land, that portion of the Birkenhead and Hoylake Railway which runs through his property, was offered for sale by auction at the Queen\u2019s Hotel, [[Chester]], on Saturday [18 September 1869]. One of the conditions of sale was that the purchaser was to pay, beyond his bid for the land, for everything found upon it a valuation made by the auctioneers, Messrs. Churton and Elphick. The solicitor representing the railway company protested against anything but the land being sold; but the auctioneer said he was acting under the authority of the Court of Chancery, and proceeded to put up the four \"lots\". The first lot was knocked down to Messrs. Roberts and Potts, Chester, for 4,000''l'',<ref group = note>\u00a34,000</ref> the only bid; the lot including the Dock Cottages station, North Birkenhead (where the line commences), adjoining land, and the railway as far as lot two, which included the Bidston station, and a length beyond this lot being also knocked down to Mr. Roberts for 1,500''l''.<ref group = note>\u00a31,500</ref> No offers were made for the other two lots. It was stated that Mr. Roberts was acting for Mr. Vyner.<ref name = advertiser>Morning Advertiser, 22 September 1869</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn fact Vyner had bought back his own land, and generously did not force closure of the railway for some time. However he must have lost patience eventually, for on 30 June 1870 a writ of ejectment was secured for him, and the Hoylake Railway was required to remove all its movable assets from the affected land. The section of line westward from [[Leasowe]] to Hoylake, outside Vyner's area of interest, was kept in operation for the time being, from 8 July 1870. Road coaches provided connections from Leasowe level crossing, where there was no proper station, and Birkenhead and Seacombe.<ref name = maund/>\n\n==Hoylake and Birkenhead Rail and Tramway Company==\nA new company, the ''Hoylake & Birkenhead Tramway Company'', was formed on 19 November 1870. Its objective may have been to acquire the Hoylake company's line and convert it to a tramway. It soon deposited a Parliamentary Bill to build a line from [[Woodside, Merseyside|Woodside]] to Birkenhead Docks, but there proved to be procedural difficulties and the new company was dissolved by Act of 1 July 1872, when a new company, the Hoylake & Birkenhead Rail and Tramway Company was incorporated. It was authorised to operate street running tramways in Birkenhead, and to take over the assets and operation of the Hoylake Railway. It acquired the assets of the Hoylake Company for \u00a322,000 and settled the outstanding debt with Vyner.<ref group = note>The Hoylake Company was formally wound up in 1875.</ref> The railway part of its operation was started on 1 August 1872, Vyner's part of the line evidently having been retained intact. In 1873 the company opened a street tramway between Wallasey Bridge Road and the Woodside ferry terminal in Birkenhead. This was of course horse-operated; it was sold on to the Birkenhead Tramway Company on 11 October 1879.<ref name = gahan/><ref name = robinson/><ref name = maund/>\n\nThe company extended the railway line from Hoylake to West Kirby,<ref group = note>Authorised by the Hoylake and Birkenhead Railway and Tramway Act, 1873.</ref> and, at the other end of the system, also made the short connection between Wallasey Bridge Road and the docks. Both of these new sections were opened on 1 April 1878. Now concentrating on its railway operation, the company changed its name to the ''Seacombe, Hoylake and Deeside Railway'', by Act of 18 July 1881.<ref name = gahan/><ref name = robinson/>\n\n==Wirral Railway==\n[[File:Ceremony of cutting of the first sod of the Wirral Railway.png|thumb|Cutting the first sod of the Wirral Railway]]The Wirral Railway was incorporated by Act of 13 June 1883; it was to build a \"Dee Extension\" line from Bidston (on the Hoylake line) to Hawarden Bridge on the River Dee, and another line from the Birkenhead Central station of the Mersey Railway to [[Woodchurch]]. Woodchurch was a place on the Dee Extension a little south of the present-day [[Upton, Merseyside|Upton]] station on the [[Hawarden Bridge]] line.\n\nIn fact the Woodchurch line was not built; but on 14 August 1884 the Company were authorised to build from Bidston to New Brighton.<ref name = gahan/><ref name = maund/>\n\n==Wirral Railway Company Limited==\nAlso authorised on 14 August 1884 was a separate company, the ''Wirral Railway Company Limited''. This new company was authorised to purchase the previous Wirral Railway company as well as the Seacombe, Hoylake and Deeside Railway.

Incredible though it may seem, there was no compressor on the train, but reliance was placed on periodic charging of a reservoir which fed air to the Westinghouse brakes and also to the Westinghouse electro-pneumatic controllers for the traction motors.

It was incorporated in 1863 as the '''Hoylake Railway''', running from [[Hoylake]] to [[Birkenhead]] Docks. After changes of name and of ownership, it was purchased by the Wirral Railway Company Limited in 1884. The network was extended to [[West Kirby]], [[New Brighton, Merseyside|New Brighton]], and [[Seacombe]], and to Birkenhead Park station where it joined the [[Mersey Railway]], enabling through trains through the Mersey Railway Tunnel to [[Liverpool]]. In the [[Railways Act 1921|1923 grouping]] the Wirral company became part of the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]], which electrified the line (except the Seacombe branch) in 1938, allowing passenger services to be integrated with the Liverpool urban system. Most of the Wirral Railway network is still in use today as part of the [[Wirral Line]] of the [[Merseyrail]] commuter rail network.\n\n==Hoylake Railway==\n[[File:Wirral rly.png|thumb|System map of the Wirral Railway]]The [[Chester and Birkenhead Railway]] opened on 23 September 1840.<ref group = note>Gahan; Maund says 22 September on page 6.</ref> This was the first penetration of the Wirral by a railway, and for some years no further attempt was made to build in the peninsula.<ref name = gahan>John W Gahan, ''Steel Wheels to Deeside: The Wirral Railway Past and Present'', Countyvise Limited, Birkenhead, 1983, {{ISBN|0 907768 70 9}}</ref><ref name = maund>T B Maund, ''The Wirral Railway and its Predecessors'', Lightmoor Press, Lydney, 2009, {{ISBN|978 1899 889 389}}</ref>\n\nObserving the success of the [[Liverpool, Crosby and Southport Railway]] in encouraging residential building, and travel, a group of business people led by Braithwaite Pool, a career railwayman, proposed a railway, to be called the Hoylake Railway. It was to connect Hoylake with Birkenhead. The route was soon modified to connect Seacombe (instead of Birkenhead) to Hoylake, with a branch from [[Bidston]] to [[Wallasey]] Bridge Road to serve Birkenhead docks. Parliamentary powers were obtained on 28 July 1863.<ref name = gahan/><ref name = robinson>H A Robinson, ''The Wirral Railway, Old and New'', in the Railway Magazine, April 1938</ref> Authorised capital was \u00a3100,000 with \u00a333,000 in permitted borrowing.<ref name = maund/>\n\nThe Hoylake company desposited further Bills in quick succession, showing a desire to reach far beyond the initial area and break the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR) and [[London and North Western Railway]] (LNWR) duopoly in the Wirral; these proposals included a long viaduct over the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]] to [[Mostyn]]. All the Bills were heavily cut back or rejected.<ref name = maund/>\n\nIn the event the Seacombe portion of the line was not built at this stage as it would have been particularly expensive. Accordingly the railway was constructed as a single line from Hoylake to Wallasey Bridge Road only, a distance of just over five miles. It was inspected by Captain Ritchie of the [[Board of Trade (Privy Council)|Board of Trade]] on 16 June 1866 and was opened to traffic on Monday 18 June 1866. However this apparently did not result in a regular train service until 2 July 1866, following a further inspection by Ritchie on that date.<ref name = maund/> There were six trains a day, four on Sundays, running from \"Birkenhead Docks\" (i.e. Wallasey Bridge Road) to Hoylake; an omnibus connection was operate to Seacombe.<ref name = gahan/><ref name = mercer>Basil Mercer, ''The Wirral Railway'', in the Railway Magazine, July 1914</ref><ref name = maund/> \"All the stations were of the most elementary type, having cinder platforms very scantily supplied with buildings, a state of affairs which in the case of the intermediate stations has persisted to the time of electrification.\"<ref name = robinson/>\n\n==Financial performance==\nAlthough passenger business was very brisk at first, this soon tailed off and the financial performance of the company was very poor, and the train service was reduced. Robinson wrote: \"The building of the line was premature, however. Hoylake in those days was a small fishing village and the rest of the coast quite undeveloped, and it was soon found that the traffic was too small to make it a paying concern.<ref name = robinson/> Money was also owing from the construction of the line, and a Mr Vyner of Bidston had not been paid for land the company had acquired from him; the debt was \u00a39,000, which the company did not have at its disposal; indeed its other liabilities amounted to \u00a320,000. He was able to arrange for bailiffs to seize part of the line at the eastern end of the network, and traffic had to be suspended.<ref name = gahan/>\n\nIt was reported:\n\n<blockquote>Sale of a Railway: ln pursuance of a [[Court of Chancery|Chancery]] decree, obtained by Mr. Robert Vyner, who has never been paid for his land, that portion of the Birkenhead and Hoylake Railway which runs through his property, was offered for sale by auction at the Queen\u2019s Hotel, [[Chester]], on Saturday [18 September 1869]. One of the conditions of sale was that the purchaser was to pay, beyond his bid for the land, for everything found upon it a valuation made by the auctioneers, Messrs. Churton and Elphick. The solicitor representing the railway company protested against anything but the land being sold; but the auctioneer said he was acting under the authority of the Court of Chancery, and proceeded to put up the four \"lots\". The first lot was knocked down to Messrs. Roberts and Potts, Chester, for 4,000''l'',<ref group = note>\u00a34,000</ref> the only bid; the lot including the Dock Cottages station, North Birkenhead (where the line commences), adjoining land, and the railway as far as lot two, which included the Bidston station, and a length beyond this lot being also knocked down to Mr. Roberts for 1,500''l''.<ref group = note>\u00a31,500</ref> No offers were made for the other two lots. It was stated that Mr. Roberts was acting for Mr. Vyner.<ref name = advertiser>Morning Advertiser, 22 September 1869</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn fact Vyner had bought back his own land, and generously did not force closure of the railway for some time. However he must have lost patience eventually, for on 30 June 1870 a writ of ejectment was secured for him, and the Hoylake Railway was required to remove all its movable assets from the affected land. The section of line westward from [[Leasowe]] to Hoylake, outside Vyner's area of interest, was kept in operation for the time being, from 8 July 1870. Road coaches provided connections from Leasowe level crossing, where there was no proper station, and Birkenhead and Seacombe.<ref name = maund/>\n\n==Hoylake and Birkenhead Rail and Tramway Company==\nA new company, the ''Hoylake & Birkenhead Tramway Company'', was formed on 19 November 1870. Its objective may have been to acquire the Hoylake company's line and convert it to a tramway. It soon deposited a Paliamentary Bill to build a line from [[Woodside, Merseyside|Woodside]] to Birkenhead Docks, but there proved to be procedural difficulties and the new company was dissolved by Act of 1 July 1872, when a new company, the Hoylake & Birkenhead Rail and Tramway Company was incorporated. It was authorised to operate street running tramways in Birkenhead, and to take over the assets and operation of the Hoylake Railway. It acquired the assets of the Hoylake Company for \u00a322,000 and settled the outstanding debt with Vyner.<ref group = note>The Hoylake Company was formally wound up in 1875.</ref> The railway part of its operation was started on 1 August 1872, Vyner's part of the line evidently having been retained intact. In 1873 the company opened a street tramway between Wallasey Bridge Road and the Woodside ferry terminal in Birkenhead. This was of course horse-operated; it was sold on to the Birkenhead Tramway Company on 11 October 1879.<ref name = gahan/><ref name = robinson/><ref name = maund/>\n\nThe company extended the railway line from Hoylake to West Kirby,<ref group = note>Authorised by the Hoylake and Birkenhead Railway and Tramway Act, 1873.</ref> and, at the other end of the system, also made the short connection between Wallasey Bridge Road and the docks.

Woodchurch was a place on the Dee Extension a little south of the present-day [[Upton, Merseyside|Upton]] station on the [[Hawarden Bridge]] line.\n\nIn fact the Woodchurch line was not built; but on 14 August 1884 the Company were authorised to build from Bidston to New Brighton.<ref name = gahan/><ref name = maund/>\n\n==Wirral Railway Company Limited==\nAlso authorised on 14 August 1884 was a separate company, the ''Wirral Railway Company Limited''.

The traction supply to the trains was at 650 V DC by third rail. Goods traffic continued to be steam hauled.<ref name = gahan/> {{frac|10|1|2}} route miles of railway were electrified. It had been proposed to electrify at 1,500 v dc overhead, but this was technically impossible through the Mersey Tunnel, so the third rail system was adopted. The position of the third rail was the same as on the [[Watford DC line|Watford New Line]] electrification, and required the Mersey Railway system to alter its third rail from 22 inches outside the running rail to 16 inches, and to fit duplicate collector shoes to its rolling stock.<ref name = gillham/>\n\nThe new rolling stock was in three-car units of which there were 19, with steel bodies and open saloon accommodation. They had air-operated sliding doors, and automatic couplers. There was one motor coach in each three car unit, and it was equipped with four 135&nbsp;hp motors. Additional power was considered to be required for the steep gradients in the Mersey Tunnel.<ref group = note>Compared with the 110 hp that would otherwise have been sufficient.</ref> Electrical equipment was supplied by [[British Thomson-Houston]], and the vehicles were manufactured by Metropolitan Carriage and Wagon Company and the [[Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company]].<ref name = gahan/><ref name = linecar>H W Linecar, ''British Electric Trains'', Ian Allan Limited, London, 1947</ref> The units later became [[British Rail Class 503]].<ref name = gillham/>\n\nAutomatic notching was provided.<ref group = note>At the time this was still a novelty.</ref> When the trains were running in the Mersey Tunnel where there is a gradient of 1 in 27, provision was made to increase the notching point of the acceleration relay. This could be actuated by a sealed push-button in the driver's cab, for use in exceptional circumstances, such as a six-car train operating with one motor coach out of action.<ref name = linecar/> Tuplin wrote that the new vehicles did not have an on-board air compressor; at the end of the run:\n\n<blockquote>the motorman emerged from his compartment with a hose, lifted an iron cover plate from a hole in the station platform and connected the hose to an underground air-supply line. Incredible though it may seem, there was no compressor on the train, but reliance was placed on periodic charging of a reservoir which fed air to the Westinghouse brakes and also to the Westinghouse electro-pneumatic controllers for the traction motors. When a satisfactory charge had been obtained, the motorman turned off the cocks on supply-pipe and reservoir, and pulled up the hose with a loud \"sssh\u2014ack\" as the air in the hose escaped.<ref name = tuplin>W A Tuplin, ''Recollections of the Wirral Railway'', in the Railway Magazine, March 1954</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Wirral line was operated on the [[third rail]] system but the Mersey Railway system was on [[fourth rail]], so the new trains were fitted with negative [[Current collector#Contact shoe|contact shoes]] and a contactor which was automatically operated according to the system.<ref name = linecar/> This was considered to be a cheaper option than installing a fourth rail throughout the new Wirral electrified area. There was a 50 foot gap in the conductor rails at each end of the Birkenhead Park station: the only such changing point on any British Railway.<ref name = gillham/>\n\nThe new service was inaugurated on 13 March 1938,<ref group = note>Sunday 13 March 1938, according to Gahan. Gillham gives 14 March 1938 on page 144.</ref> with trains running through to Liverpool through the former Mersey Railway route, now also, of course part of the LMS. Trains ran every 15 minutes, enhanced to 10 minutes at the busiest times. The Seacombe branch passenger service was now exclusively operated by steam trains of the [[London and North Eastern Railway]] (as successor since 1923 to the [[Great Central Railway]]).<ref name = gahan/><ref name = gillham>J C Gillham, ''The Age of the Electric Train'', Ian Allan Limited,  Shepperton, 1988, 0 7110 1392 6</ref>\n\nThrough coaches from New Brighton to London had been inaugurated in 1923, one journey in each direction being made. When the New Brighton line was electrified, the London service continued at first, and was the only steam hauled passenger service on the New Brighton line. The coaches ran via West Kirby to Hooton, where they were attached to a main line train. The engine power was customarily a class 3F 0-6-0.<ref name = gahan/>\n\n==After 1948==\nOn 1 January 1948 most of the railways of Great Britain were taken into national ownership under British Railways.\n\nIn the 1950s usage of the Seacombe branch declined steeply: both the goods traffic and passenger traffic diminished. The passenger service was withdrawn after the close of service on Sunday 3 January 1960. The branch was closed to all traffic on 17 June 1963.

However, these animals are usually, in common parlance, referred to as [[parasite]]s rather than pathogens.  The scientific study of microscopic organisms, including microscopic pathogenic organisms, is called [[microbiology]], while the study of disease that may include these pathogens is called [[pathology]]. [[Parasitology]], meanwhile, is the scientific study of parasites and the organisms that host them.\n\nThere are several pathways through which pathogens can invade a host. The principal pathways have different episodic time frames, but [[soil organic matter|soil]] has the longest or most persistent potential for harboring a pathogen. Diseases in humans that are caused by infectious agents are known as pathogenic diseases, though not all diseases are caused by pathogens.  Some diseases, such as [[Huntington's disease]], are caused by inheritance of abnormal genes.\n\n==Pathogenicity==\n'''Pathogenicity''' is the potential disease-causing capacity of pathogens.  Pathogenicity is related to [[virulence]] in meaning, but some authorities have come to distinguish it as a ''qualitative'' term, whereas the latter is ''quantitative''.  By this standard, an organism may be said to be pathogenic or non-pathogenic in a particular context, but not \"more pathogenic\" than another.  Such comparisons are described instead in terms of relative virulence.  Pathogenicity is also distinct from the [[Basic reproduction number|transmissibility]] of the virus, which quantifies the risk of infection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coloss.org/beebook/II/virus/1/2|title=1.2. Definitions: pathogenicity vs virulence; incidence vs prevalence |publisher=COLOSS}}</ref>\n\nA pathogen may be described in terms of its ability to produce [[toxin]]s, enter tissue, colonize, hijack nutrients, and its ability to [[immunosuppression|immunosuppress]] the host.\n\n===Context-dependent pathogenicity===\nIt is common to speak of an entire species of bacteria as pathogenic when it is identified as the cause of a disease ''(cf. [[Koch's postulates]])''.  However, the modern view is that pathogenicity depends on the microbial ecosystem as a whole.  A bacterium may participate in [[opportunistic infection]]s in [[immunocompromised]] hosts, acquire [[virulence factor]]s by [[plasmid]] infection, become transferred to a different site within the host, or respond to changes in the overall numbers of other bacteria present.  For example, infection of mesenteric [[Lymph node|lymph glands]] of mice with ''[[Yersinia]]'' can clear the way for continuing infection of these sites by ''[[Lactobacillus]]'', possibly by a mechanism of \"immunological scarring\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=From transient infection to chronic disease|author=Carl Nathan|journal=Science|date=2015-10-09|volume=350|issue=6257|doi=10.1126/science.aad4141|pmid=26450196|pages=161|bibcode=2015Sci...350..161N}}</ref>\n\n===Related concepts===\n\n====Virulence====\n[[Virulence]] (the tendency of a pathogen to reduce a host's [[fitness (biology)|fitness]]) evolves when a pathogen can spread from a diseased host, despite the host becoming debilitated. [[Horizontal transmission]] occurs between hosts of the same species, in contrast to [[vertical transmission]], which tends to evolve toward [[symbiosis]] (after a period of high morbidity and mortality in the population) by linking the pathogen's evolutionary success to the evolutionary success of the host organism. [[Evolutionary biology]] proposes that many pathogens evolve an [[optimal virulence]] at which the fitness gained by increased replication rates is balanced by trade-offs in reduced transmission, but the exact mechanisms underlying these relationships remain controversial.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Alizon |first1=S. |last2=Hurford |first2=A. |last3=Mideo |first3=N. |last4=van Baalen |first4=M. |title=Virulence evolution and the trade-off hypothesis: history, current state of affairs and the future |journal=J Evol Biol |date=February 2009 |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=245\u2013259 |doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2008.01658.x|pmid=19196383 }}</ref>\n\n====Transmission====\n{{main|Transmission (medicine)}}\nTransmission of pathogens occurs through many different routes, including airborne, direct or indirect contact, sexual contact, through blood, breast milk, or other body fluids, and through the [[fecal-oral route]].\n\n==Types of pathogens==\n\n=== Prions ===\n{{Main|Prion}}\nPrions are misfolded proteins that can transfer their misfolded state to other normally folded proteins of the same type. They do not contain any DNA or RNA and cannot replicate other than to convert already existing normal proteins to the misfolded state.

However, these animals are usually, in common parlance, referred to as [[parasite]]s rather than pathogens.  The scientific study of microscopic organisms, including microscopic pathogenic organisms, is called [[microbiology]], while the study of disease that may include these pathogens is called [[pathology]]. [[Parasitology]], meanwhile, is the scientific study of parasites and the organisms that host them.\n\nThere are several pathways through which pathogens can invade a host. The principal pathways have different episodic time frames, but [[soil organic matter|soil]] has the longest or most persistent potential for harboring a pathogen. Diseases in humans that are caused by infectious agents are known as pathogenic diseases, though not all diseases are caused by pathogens.  Some diseases, such as [[Huntington's disease]], are caused by inheritance of abnormal genes.\n\n==Pathogenicity==\n'''Pathogenicity''' is the potential disease-causing capacity of pathogens.  Pathogenicity is related to [[virulence]] in meaning, but some authorities have come to distinguish it as a ''qualitative'' term, whereas the latter is ''quantitative''.  By this standard, an organism may be said to be pathogenic or non-pathogenic in a particular context, but not \"more pathogenic\" than another.  Such comparisons are described instead in terms of relative virulence.  Pathogenicity is also distinct from the [[Basic reproduction number|transmissibility]] of the virus, which quantifies the risk of infection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coloss.org/beebook/II/virus/1/2|title=1.2. Definitions: pathogenicity vs virulence; incidence vs prevalence |publisher=COLOSS}}</ref>\n\nA pathogen may be described in terms of its ability to produce [[toxin]]s, enter tissue, colonize, hijack nutrients, and its ability to [[immunosuppression|immunosuppress]] the host.\n\n===Context-dependent pathogenicity===\nIt is common to speak of an entire species of bacteria as pathogenic when it is identified as the cause of a disease ''(cf. [[Koch's postulates]])''.  However, the modern view is that pathogenicity depends on the microbial ecosystem as a whole.  A bacterium may participate in [[opportunistic infection]]s in [[immunocompromised]] hosts, acquire [[virulence factor]]s by [[plasmid]] infection, become transferred to a different site within the host, or respond to changes in the overall numbers of other bacteria present.  For example, infection of mesenteric [[Lymph node|lymph glands]] of mice with ''[[Yersinia]]'' can clear the way for continuing infection of these sites by ''[[Lactobacillus]]'', possibly by a mechanism of \"immunological scarring\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=From transient infection to chronic disease|author=Carl Nathan|journal=Science|date=2015-10-09|volume=350|issue=6257|doi=10.1126/science.aad4141|pmid=26450196|pages=161|bibcode=2015Sci...350..161N}}</ref>\n\n===Related concepts===\n\n====Virulence====\n[[Virulence]] (the tendency of a pathogen to reduce a host's [[fitness (biology)|fitness]]) evolves when a pathogen can spread from a diseased host, despite the host becoming debilitated. [[Horizontal transmission]] occurs between hosts of the same species, in contrast to [[vertical transmission]], which tends to evolve toward [[symbiosis]] (after a period of high morbidity and mortality in the population) by linking the pathogen's evolutionary success to the evolutionary success of the host organism. [[Evolutionary biology]] proposes that many pathogens evolve an [[optimal virulence]] at which the fitness gained by increased replication rates is balanced by trade-offs in reduced transmission, but the exact mechanisms underlying these relationships remain controversial.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Alizon |first1=S. |last2=Hurford |first2=A. |last3=Mideo |first3=N. |last4=van Baalen |first4=M. |title=Virulence evolution and the trade-off hypothesis: history, current state of affairs and the future |journal=J Evol Biol |date=February 2009 |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=245\u2013259 |doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2008.01658.x|pmid=19196383 }}</ref>\n\n====Transmission====\n{{main|Transmission (medicine)}}\nTransmission of pathogens occurs through many different routes, including airborne, direct or indirect contact, sexual contact, through blood, breast milk, or other body fluids, and through the [[fecal-oral route]].\n\n==Types of pathogens==\n\n=== Prions ===\n{{Main|Prion}}\nPrions are misfolded proteins that can transfer their misfolded state to other normally folded proteins of the same type.

Many other bacterial pathogens lack vaccines as a preventive measure, but infection by these bacteria can often be treated or prevented with [[antibiotic]]s. Common antibiotics include [[amoxicillin]], [[Ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone|ciprofloxacin]], and [[doxycycline]]. Each antibiotic has different bacteria that it is effective against and has different mechanisms to kill that bacteria. For example, [[doxycycline]] inhibits the synthesis of new proteins in both [[Gram-negative bacteria|gram-negative]] and [[gram-positive bacteria]] which leads to the death of the affected bacteria.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rang and Dale's pharmacology|last=Rang, H.

This process involves pairing of homologous genomes and recombination between them by a process referred to as multiplicity reactivation.  Examples of viruses that undergo this process are [[herpes simplex virus]], [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]], and [[vaccinia]] virus.<ref name=\"Bernstein\" />\n\nThe sexual processes in bacteria, microbial eukaryotes, and viruses all involve recombination between homologous genomes that appears to facilitate the [[DNA repair|repair]] of genome damages inflicted on the genome of the pathogens by the defenses of their respective target hosts.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biology|Medicine}}\n* [[Antigenic escape]]\n* [[Ecological competence]]\n* [[Emerging Pathogens Institute]]\n* [[Human pathogen]]\n* [[PHI-base|Pathogen-Host Interaction Database (PHI-base)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|33em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"casadevall2014\">{{cite journal | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | title=Ditch the term pathogen | author=Casadevall, Arturo | author2=Pirofski, Liise-anne | department=Comment | issue=7530 | volume=516 | pages=165\u20136 | type=paper | date=11 December 2014 | doi=10.1038/516165a | pmid=25503219| author-link=Arturo Casadevall }}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://d.umn.edu/~rhicks/genmicro/Pronunciation%20Guide.pdf Pronunciation Guide to Microorganisms (1)]\n* [http://rci.rutgers.edu/~microlab/CLASSINFO/IMAGESCI/pronunciation%20guide.pdf Pronunciation Guide to Microorganisms (2)]\n\n{{Infectious disease}}\n\n[[Category:Infectious diseases]]\n", "name_user": "Mario Nacciamo", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"}

In 1994, [[U.S. Customs]] agents conducted a [[sting operation]] named [[Operation Dragon Fire (1994)|Operation Dragon Fire]] against [[Atlanta]]-based importers of Norinco firearms as well as [[Poly Technologies]].

The Borough Council consisted of six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year.<ref name=DataBook>''2012 New Jersey Legislative District Data Book'', [[Rutgers University]] [[Edward J.

The Mayor presided at the Borough Council meetings and voted in the case of a tie or a few other specific cases.\n\nThe Borough Council had administrative powers and was the policy-making body of the Borough. The Council had six members; two were elected each year and they served three-year terms. The Council approved appointments made by the Mayor. Council Members served on various boards and committees and acted as liaison's to certain Departments, Committees or Boards.\nThe [[Mayor of the Borough of Princeton, New Jersey]] was Yina Moore ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]], term ended on December 31, 2012).

In Princeton Borough 1,385 voted for, 902 voted against while in Princeton Township 3,542 voted for and 604 voted against. Proponents of the merger asserted that when the merger is completed the new municipality of Princeton will save $3.2 million as a result of some scaled-down services, including layoffs of 15 government workers, including 9 police officers (however, the measure itself does not mandate such layoffs).  Opponents of the measure challenged the findings of the report, citing cost savings as unsubstantiated, and noted that voter representation would be reduced in a smaller government structure.<ref name=tt/> The consolidation took effect on January 1, 2013.<ref name=app>{{cite news|date= November 8, 2011 |title= 2 Princetons vote to merge into 1 town|url= http://www.app.com/article/20111108/NJNEWS1002/311080107/2-Princetons-vote-to-merge-into-1-town |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work= [[Asbury Park Press]] |location= Asbury Park, NJ |accessdate= November 10, 2011}}</ref> December 31, 2012 was the last day the Borough of Princeton existed as a municipality.\n\n===Federal, state and county representation===\nThe Borough of Princeton was in the 12th Congressional district<ref name=LWV>[http://www.lwvnj.org/images/cg_2011.pdf#page=63 ''2011 New Jersey Citizen\u2019s Guide to Government''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604153059/http://www.lwvnj.org/images/cg_2011.pdf#page=63 |date=2013-06-04 }}, p. 63, New Jersey [[League of Women Voters]].
