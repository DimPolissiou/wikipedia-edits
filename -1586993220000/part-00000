In general, those studies tend to use robust quasi-experimental econometrics methods along with policy variation to predict e-cigarette use rather than relying on individual selection. Using policy variation is critical as it avoids the methodological challenge that many e-cigarette users are high-risk individuals that would have otherwise smoked cigarettes and may now use e-cigarettes first to \u201ctest the waters\u201d before transitioning to their a-priori preferred choice of cigarettes. Therefore, using policy variation is an improvement over much of the current e-cigarette research to date that fails to separate the causal effect of e-cigarette use from preferences to gradually increase the riskiness of tobacco product use over time. These studies using policy variation generally conclude that e-cigarettes are displacing smoking, which aligns with cigarette use rates falling while e-cigarette use rates are rising.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bauld |first1=Linda |last2=MacKintosh |first2=Anne |last3=Eastwood |first3=Brian |last4=Ford |first4=Allison |last5=Moore |first5=Graham |last6=Dockrell |first6=Martin |last7=Arnott |first7=Deborah |last8=Cheeseman |first8=Hazel |last9=McNeill |first9=Ann |title=Young People\u2019s Use of E-Cigarettes across the United Kingdom: Findings from Five Surveys 2015\u20132017 |journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health |date=29 August 2017 |volume=14 |issue=9 |pages=973 |doi=10.3390/ijerph14090973}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=E-cigarette use triples among middle and high school students in just one year. |url=https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2015/p0416-E-cigarette-use.html. |website=Centre for Disease Control and Prevention Newsroom (2015)}}</ref> <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Levy |first1=David T |last2=Warner |first2=Kenneth E |last3=Cummings |first3=K Michael |last4=Hammond |first4=David |last5=Kuo |first5=Charlene |last6=Fong |first6=Geoffrey T |last7=Thrasher |first7=James F |last8=Goniewicz |first8=Maciej Lukasz |last9=Borland |first9=Ron |title=Examining the relationship of vaping to smoking initiation among US youth and young adults: a reality check |journal=Tobacco Control |date=November 2019 |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=629\u2013635 |doi=10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2018-054446}}</ref> <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hallingberg |first1=Britt |last2=Maynard |first2=Olivia M. |last3=Bauld |first3=Linda |last4=Brown |first4=Rachel |last5=Gray |first5=Linsay |last6=Lowthian |first6=Emily |last7=MacKintosh |first7=Anne-Marie |last8=Moore |first8=Laurence |last9=Munafo |first9=Marcus R. |last10=Moore |first10=Graham |title=Have e-cigarettes renormalised or displaced youth smoking?

In general, those studies tend to use robust quasi-experimental econometrics methods along with policy variation to predict e-cigarette use rather than relying on individual selection. Using policy variation is critical as it avoids the methodological challenge that many e-cigarette users are high-risk individuals that would have otherwise smoked cigarettes and may now use e-cigarettes first to \u201ctest the waters\u201d before transitioning to their a-priori preferred choice of cigarettes. Therefore, using policy variation is an improvement over much of the current e-cigarette research to date that fails to separate the causal effect of e-cigarette use from preferences to gradually increase the riskiness of tobacco product use over time. These studies using policy variation generally conclude that e-cigarettes are displacing smoking, which aligns with cigarette use rates falling while e-cigarette use rates are rising.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bauld |first1=Linda |last2=MacKintosh |first2=Anne |last3=Eastwood |first3=Brian |last4=Ford |first4=Allison |last5=Moore |first5=Graham |last6=Dockrell |first6=Martin |last7=Arnott |first7=Deborah |last8=Cheeseman |first8=Hazel |last9=McNeill |first9=Ann |title=Young People\u2019s Use of E-Cigarettes across the United Kingdom: Findings from Five Surveys 2015\u20132017 |journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health |date=29 August 2017 |volume=14 |issue=9 |pages=973 |doi=10.3390/ijerph14090973}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=E-cigarette use triples among middle and high school students in just one year. |url=https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2015/p0416-E-cigarette-use.html. |website=Centre for Disease Control and Prevention Newsroom (2015)}}</ref> <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Levy |first1=David T |last2=Warner |first2=Kenneth E |last3=Cummings |first3=K Michael |last4=Hammond |first4=David |last5=Kuo |first5=Charlene |last6=Fong |first6=Geoffrey T |last7=Thrasher |first7=James F |last8=Goniewicz |first8=Maciej Lukasz |last9=Borland |first9=Ron |title=Examining the relationship of vaping to smoking initiation among US youth and young adults: a reality check |journal=Tobacco Control |date=November 2019 |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=629\u2013635 |doi=10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2018-054446}}</ref> <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hallingberg |first1=Britt |last2=Maynard |first2=Olivia M. |last3=Bauld |first3=Linda |last4=Brown |first4=Rachel |last5=Gray |first5=Linsay |last6=Lowthian |first6=Emily |last7=MacKintosh |first7=Anne-Marie |last8=Moore |first8=Laurence |last9=Munafo |first9=Marcus R. |last10=Moore |first10=Graham |title=Have e-cigarettes renormalised or displaced youth smoking?

There are two types of events i.e. negative events can be classified as risks while positive events are classified as opportunities.  Risk management [[Technical standard|standards]] have been developed by various institutions, including the [[Project Management Institute]], the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], actuarial societies, and ISO standards.<ref name=voc>{{cite book | author=ISO/IEC Guide 73:2009 | title= Risk management \u2014 Vocabulary | publisher=International Organization for Standardization | year=2009 | url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=44651}}</ref><ref name=iso>{{cite book | author=ISO/DIS 31000 | title= Risk management \u2014 Principles and guidelines on implementation | publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]] | year=2009 | url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=43170}}</ref> Methods, definitions and goals vary widely according to whether the risk management method is in the context of project management, security, [[Risk analysis (engineering)|engineering]], [[Industrial Process|industrial processes]], financial portfolios, actuarial assessments, or public health and safety.\n\nStrategies to manage threats (uncertainties with negative consequences) typically include avoiding the threat, reducing the negative effect or probability of the threat, transferring all or part of the threat to another party, and even retaining some or all of the potential or actual consequences of a particular threat. The opposite of these strategies can be used to respond to opportunities (uncertain future states with benefits).\n\nCertain risk management standards have been criticized for having no measurable improvement on risk, whereas the confidence in estimates and decisions seems to increase.<ref name=\"Risk Management pg. 46\"/> For example, one study found that one in six IT projects were \"[[black swan theory|black swan]]s\" with gigantic overruns (cost overruns averaged 200%, and schedule overruns 70%).<ref name=\"Bent Flyvbjerg\">{{cite journal|author1=Flyvbjerg, Bent  |author2=Budzier, Alexander  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2011|title=Why Your IT Project May Be Riskier Than You Think|url=https://hbr.org/2011/09/why-your-it-project-may-be-riskier-than-you-think|journal= Harvard Business Review|volume=89|issue=9|pages=601\u2013603}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Introduction ==\n\nA widely used vocabulary for risk management is defined by ''ISO Guide 73:2009'', \"Risk management. Vocabulary.\"<ref name=voc/>\n\nIn ideal risk management, a prioritization process is followed whereby the risks with the greatest loss (or impact) and the greatest [[probability]] of occurring are handled first. Risks with lower probability of occurrence and lower loss are handled in descending order. In practice the process of assessing overall risk can be difficult, and balancing resources used to mitigate between risks with a high probability of occurrence but lower loss, versus a risk with high loss but lower probability of occurrence can often be mishandled.\n\nIntangible risk management identifies a new type of a risk that has a 100% probability of occurring but is ignored by the organization due to a lack of identification ability. For example, when deficient knowledge is applied to a situation, a [[knowledge]] risk materializes. Relationship risk appears when ineffective collaboration occurs. Process-engagement risk may be an issue when ineffective operational procedures are applied. These risks directly reduce the productivity of knowledge workers, decrease cost-effectiveness, profitability, service, quality, reputation, brand value, and earnings quality. Intangible risk management allows risk management to create immediate value from the identification and reduction of risks that reduce productivity.\n\nOpportunity cost represents a unique challenge for risk managers. It can be difficult to determine when to put resources toward risk management and when to use those resources elsewhere. Again, ideal risk management minimizes spending (or manpower or other resources) and also minimizes the negative effects of risks.\n\nRisk is defined as the possibility that an event will occur that adversely affects the achievement of an objective. Uncertainty, therefore, is a key aspect of risk.  Systems like the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission Enterprise Risk Management (COSO ERM), can assist managers in mitigating risk factors.  Each company may have different internal control components, which leads to different outcomes. For example, the framework for ERM components includes Internal Environment, Objective Setting, Event Identification, Risk Assessment, Risk Response, Control Activities, Information and Communication, and Monitoring.\n\n===Method===\n\nFor the most part, these methods consist of the following elements, performed, more or less, in the following order.\n\n# Identify the threats\n# Assess the vulnerability of critical assets to specific threats\n# Determine the [[risk]] (i.e. the expected likelihood and consequences of specific types of attacks on specific assets)\n# Identify ways to reduce those risks\n# Prioritize risk reduction measures\n\n===Principles===\n\nThe [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) identifies the following principles of risk management:<ref name=\"iso3100\">{{Cite news |title=Committee Draft of ISO 31000 Risk management |publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]] |url=http://www.nsai.ie/uploads/file/N047_Committee_Draft_of_ISO_31000.pdf |format=PDF |publication-date=2007-06-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325160441/http://www.nsai.ie/uploads/file/N047_Committee_Draft_of_ISO_31000.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-25 }}</ref>\n\nRisk management should:\n* Create [[value (economics)|value]] \u2013 resources expended to mitigate risk should be less than the consequence of inaction\n* Be an integral part of organizational processes\n* Be part of decision making process\n* Explicitly address uncertainty and assumptions\n* Be a systematic and structured process\n* Be based on the best available information\n* Be tailorable\n* Take human factors into account\n* Be transparent and inclusive\n* Be dynamic, iterative and responsive to change\n* Be capable of continual improvement and enhancement\n* Be continually or periodically re-assessed\n\n==Process==\nAccording to the standard [[ISO 31000]] \"Risk management \u2013 Principles and guidelines on implementation,\"<ref name=iso /> the process of risk management consists of several steps as follows:\n\n===Establishing the context===\nThis involves:\n\n#observing the context\n#*the social scope of risk management\n#*the identity and objectives of [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]]\n#*the basis upon which risks will be evaluated, constraints.\n#defining a framework for the activity and an agenda for identification\n#developing an analysis of risks involved in the process\n#mitigation or solution of risks using available technological, human and organizational resources\n\n===Identification===\nAfter establishing the context, the next step in the process of managing risk is to identify potential risks.  Risks are about events that, when triggered, cause problems or benefits. Hence, risk identification can start with the source of our problems and those of our competitors (benefit), or with the problem consequenses.\n* Source analysis<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.madrid.org/cs/StaticFiles/Emprendedores/Analisis_Riesgos/pages/pdf/metodologia/3IdentificaciondelosRiesgos_en.pdf|title=Risk Identification|publisher=Comunidad de Madrid|page=3}}</ref> \u2013 Risk sources may be internal or external to the system that is the target of risk management (use mitigation instead of management since by its own definition risk deals with factors of decision-making that cannot be managed).\nExamples of risk sources are: stakeholders of a project, employees of a company or the weather over an airport.\n* Problem analysis{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} \u2013 Risks are related to identified threats. For example: the threat of losing money, the threat of abuse of confidential information or the threat of human errors, accidents and casualties. The threats may exist with various entities, most important with shareholders, customers and legislative bodies such as the government.\nWhen either source or problem is known, the events that a source may trigger or the events that can lead to a problem can be investigated. For example: stakeholders withdrawing during a project may endanger funding of the project; confidential information may be stolen by employees even within a closed network; lightning striking an aircraft during takeoff may make all people on board immediate casualties.\n\nThe chosen method of identifying risks may depend on culture, industry practice and compliance. The identification methods are formed by templates or the development of templates for identifying source, problem or event. Common risk identification methods are:\n* Objectives-based risk identification {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} \u2013 Organizations and project teams have objectives. Any event that may prevent an objective from being achieved is identified as risk.\n* Scenario-based risk identification \u2013 In [[scenario analysis]] different scenarios are created. The scenarios may be the alternative ways to achieve an objective, or an analysis of the interaction of forces in, for example, a market or battle. Any event that triggers an undesired scenario alternative is identified as risk \u2013 see [[Futures Studies]] for methodology used by [[Futurists]].\n* Taxonomy-based risk identification \u2013 The taxonomy in taxonomy-based risk identification is a breakdown of possible risk sources. Based on the taxonomy and knowledge of best practices, a questionnaire is compiled. The answers to the questions reveal risks.<ref>[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/abstracts/reports/93tr006.cfm CMU/SEI-93-TR-6 Taxonomy-based risk identification in software industry]. Sei.cmu.edu.

Each risk in the list can be checked for application to a particular situation.<ref>[http://cve.mitre.org Common Vulnerability and Exposures list]. Cve.mitre.org. Retrieved on 2012-04-17.</ref>\n* Risk charting<ref>{{cite book|last=Crockford|first=Neil|title=An Introduction to Risk Management|location=Cambridge, UK|publisher=Woodhead-Faulkner|edition=2|year=1986|page=18|isbn=0-85941-332-2}}</ref> \u2013 This method combines the above approaches by listing resources at risk, threats to those resources, modifying factors which may increase or decrease the risk and consequences it is wished to avoid. Creating a [[Risk matrix|matrix]] under these headings enables a variety of approaches. One can begin with resources and consider the threats they are exposed to and the consequences of each. Alternatively one can start with the threats and examine which resources they would affect, or one can begin with the consequences and determine which combination of threats and resources would be involved to bring them about.\n\n===Assessment===\n{{Main|Risk assessment}}\nOnce risks have been identified, they must then be assessed as to their potential severity of impact (generally a negative impact, such as damage or loss) and to the probability of occurrence. These quantities can be either simple to measure, in the case of the value of a lost building, or impossible to know for sure in the case of an unlikely event, the probability of occurrence of which is unknown. Therefore, in the assessment process it is critical to make the best educated decisions in order to properly prioritize the implementation of the [[risk management plan]].\n\nEven a short-term positive improvement can have long-term negative impacts.  Take the \"turnpike\" example. A highway is widened to allow more traffic. More traffic capacity leads to greater development in the areas surrounding the improved traffic capacity. Over time, traffic thereby increases to fill available capacity. Turnpikes thereby need to be expanded in a seemingly endless cycles. There are many other engineering examples where expanded capacity (to do any function) is soon filled by increased demand. Since expansion comes at a cost, the resulting growth could become unsustainable without forecasting and management.\n\nThe fundamental difficulty in risk assessment is determining the rate of occurrence since statistical information is not available on all kinds of past incidents and is particularly scanty in the case of catastrophic events, simply because of their infrequency. Furthermore, evaluating the severity of the consequences (impact) is often quite difficult for intangible assets. Asset valuation is another question that needs to be addressed. Thus, best educated opinions and available statistics are the primary sources of information. Nevertheless, risk assessment should produce such information for senior executives of the organization that the primary risks are easy to understand and that the risk management decisions may be prioritized within overall company goals. Thus, there have been several theories and attempts to quantify risks. Numerous different risk formulae exist, but perhaps the most widely accepted formula for risk quantification is: \"Rate (or probability) of occurrence multiplied by the impact of the event equals risk magnitude.\"{{vague|section|date=January 2016}}\n\n==Risk options==\nRisk mitigation measures are usually formulated according to one or more of the following major risk options, which are:\n\n#Design a new business process with adequate built-in risk control and containment measures from the start.\n#Periodically re-assess risks that are accepted in ongoing processes as a normal feature of business operations and modify mitigation measures.\n#Transfer risks to an external agency (e.g. an insurance company)\n#Avoid risks altogether (e.g. by closing down a particular high-risk business area)\n\nLater research<ref>{{cite web|title=CRISC Exam Questions|url=https://www.dumpsbook.com/Exam/CRISC|accessdate= 23 Feb 2018}}</ref> has shown that the financial benefits of risk management are less dependent on the formula used but are more dependent on the frequency and how risk assessment is performed.\n\nIn business it is imperative to be able to present the findings of risk assessments in financial, market, or schedule terms. Robert Courtney Jr. (IBM, 1970) proposed a formula for presenting risks in financial terms. The Courtney formula was accepted as the official risk analysis method for the US governmental agencies. The formula proposes calculation of ALE (annualized loss expectancy) and compares the expected loss value to the security control implementation costs ([[cost-benefit analysis]]).\n\n===Potential risk treatments===\nOnce risks have been identified and assessed, all techniques to manage the risk fall into one or more of these four major categories:<ref>{{cite book |last=Dorfman|first=Mark S. |title=Introduction to Risk Management and Insurance|edition=9 |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-13-224227-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n* Avoidance (eliminate, withdraw from or not become involved)\n* Reduction (optimize \u2013 mitigate)\n* Sharing (transfer \u2013 outsource or insure)\n* Retention (accept and budget)\n\nIdeal use of these [[risk control strategies]] may not be possible.  Some of them may involve trade-offs that are not acceptable to the organization or person making the risk management decisions. Another source, from the US Department of Defense (see link), [[Defense Acquisition University]], calls these categories ACAT, for Avoid, Control, Accept, or Transfer.  This use of the ACAT acronym is reminiscent of another ACAT (for Acquisition Category) used in US Defense industry procurements, in which Risk Management figures prominently in decision making and planning.\n\n====Risk avoidance====\nThis includes not performing an activity that could present risk. Refusing to purchase a [[Real property|property]] or business to avoid [[legal liability]] is one such example.  Avoiding [[airplane]] flights for fear of [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacking]].  Avoidance may seem like the answer to all risks, but avoiding risks also means losing out on the potential gain that accepting (retaining) the risk may have allowed.  Not entering a business to avoid the risk of loss also avoids the possibility of earning profits.  Increasing risk regulation in hospitals has led to avoidance of treating higher risk conditions, in favor of patients presenting with lower risk.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McGivern|first=Gerry|author2=Fischer, Michael D. |title=Reactivity and reactions to regulatory transparency in medicine, psychotherapy and counseling|journal=Social Science & Medicine|date=1 February 2012|volume=74|issue=3|pages=289\u2013296|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.09.035|pmid=22104085|url=http://eureka.sbs.ox.ac.uk/4314/1/McGivern_G___Fischer_M_D__%282012%29_Reactivity_and_Reactions_to_Regulatory_Transparency_in_Medicine_Psychotherapy_and_Counselling_%28Authors%27_version%29.pdf}}</ref>\n\n====Risk reduction====\nRisk reduction or \"optimization\" involves reducing the severity of the loss or the likelihood of the loss from occurring.  For example, [[Fire sprinkler|sprinkler]]s are designed to put out a [[fire]] to reduce the risk of loss by fire.  This method may cause a greater loss by water damage and therefore may not be suitable. [[Halomethane|Halon]] fire suppression systems may mitigate that risk, but the cost may be prohibitive as a [[strategy]].\n\nAcknowledging that risks can be positive or negative, optimizing risks means finding a balance between negative risk and the benefit of the operation or activity; and between risk reduction and effort applied. By effectively applying [[Health, Safety and Environment]] (HSE) management standards, organizations can achieve tolerable levels of [[residual risk]].<ref>[https://www.iadc.org/ebookstore/ebook-iadc-hse-case-guidelines-for-mobile-offshore-drilling-units/ IADC HSE Case Guidelines for Mobile Offshore Drilling Units] 3.2, section 4.7</ref>\n\nModern software development methodologies reduce risk by developing and delivering software incrementally.  Early methodologies suffered from the fact that they only delivered software in the final phase of development; any problems encountered in earlier phases meant costly rework and often jeopardized the whole project.  By developing in iterations, software projects can limit effort wasted to a single iteration.\n\n[[Outsourcing]] could be an example of risk sharing strategy if the outsourcer can demonstrate higher capability at managing or reducing risks.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Roehrig|first=P|year=2006|url=http://www.btquarterly.com/?mc=bet-governance&page=ss-viewresearch|title=Bet On Governance To Manage Outsourcing Risk|journal=Business Trends Quarterly}}</ref> For example, a company may outsource only its software development, the manufacturing of hard goods, or customer support needs to another company, while handling the business management itself.  This way, the company can concentrate more on business development without having to worry as much about the manufacturing process, managing the development team, or finding a physical location for a center.\n\n====Risk sharing====\nBriefly defined as \"sharing with another party the burden of loss or the benefit of gain, from a risk, and the measures to reduce a risk.\"\n\nThe term of 'risk transfer' is often used in place of risk sharing in the mistaken belief that you can transfer a risk to a third party through insurance or outsourcing. In practice if the insurance company or contractor go bankrupt or end up in court, the original risk is likely to still revert to the first party. As such, in the terminology of practitioners and scholars alike, the purchase of an insurance contract is often described as a \"transfer of risk.\" However, technically speaking, the buyer of the contract generally retains legal responsibility for the losses \"transferred\", meaning that insurance may be described more accurately as a post-event compensatory mechanism. For example, a personal injuries insurance policy does not transfer the risk of a car accident to the insurance company. The risk still lies with the policy holder namely the person who has been in the accident. The insurance policy simply provides that if an accident (the event) occurs involving the policy holder then some compensation may be payable to the policy holder that is commensurate with the suffering/damage.\n\nMethods of managing risk fall into multiple categories. Risk retention pools are technically retaining the risk for the group, but spreading it over the whole group involves transfer among individual members of the group. This is different from traditional insurance, in that no premium is exchanged between members of the group up front, but instead losses are assessed to all members of the group.\n\n====Risk retention====\nRisk retention involves accepting the loss, or benefit of gain, from a risk when the incident occurs.  True [[self-insurance]] falls in this category.  Risk retention is a viable strategy for small risks where the cost of insuring against the risk would be greater over time than the total losses sustained. All risks that are not avoided or transferred are retained by default.  This includes risks that are so large or catastrophic that either they cannot be insured against or the premiums would be infeasible. [[War]] is an example since most property and risks are not insured against war, so the loss attributed to war is retained by the insured.  Also any amounts of potential loss (risk) over the amount insured is retained risk.  This may also be acceptable if the chance of a very large loss is small or if the cost to insure for greater coverage amounts is so great that it would hinder the goals of the organization too much.\n\n===Risk management plan===\n{{main|Risk management plan}}\n\nSelect appropriate controls or countermeasures to mitigate each risk. Risk mitigation needs to be approved by the appropriate level of management. For instance, a risk concerning the image of the organization should have top management decision behind it whereas IT management would have the authority to decide on computer virus risks.\n\nThe risk management plan should propose applicable and effective security controls for managing the risks. For example, an observed high risk of computer viruses could be mitigated by acquiring and implementing antivirus software. A good risk management plan should contain a schedule for control implementation and responsible persons for those actions.\n\nAccording to [[ISO/IEC 27001]], the stage immediately after completion of the [[risk assessment]] phase consists of preparing a Risk Treatment Plan, which should document the decisions about how each of the identified risks should be handled.  Mitigation of risks often means selection of [[security controls]], which should be documented in a Statement of Applicability, which identifies which particular control objectives and controls from the \nstandard have been selected, and why.\n\n===Implementation===\nImplementation follows all of the planned methods for mitigating the effect of the risks.  Purchase insurance policies for the risks that it has been decided to transferred to an insurer, avoid all risks that can be avoided without sacrificing the entity's goals, reduce others, and retain the rest.\n\n===Review and evaluation of the plan===\nInitial risk management plans will never be perfect. Practice, experience, and actual loss results will necessitate changes in the plan and contribute information to allow possible different decisions to be made in dealing with the risks being faced.\n\n[[Risk analysis (business)|Risk analysis]] results and management plans should be updated periodically. There are two primary reasons for this: \n# to evaluate whether the previously selected security controls are still applicable and effective\n# to evaluate the possible risk level changes in the business environment. For example, information risks are a good example of rapidly changing business environment.\n\n==Limitations==\nPrioritizing the ''risk management processes'' too highly could keep an organization from ever completing a project or even getting started.  This is especially true if other work is suspended until the risk management process is considered complete.\n\nIt is also important to keep in mind the distinction between risk and [[uncertainty]]. Risk can be measured by impacts \u00d7 probability.\n\nIf risks are improperly assessed and prioritized, time can be wasted in dealing with risk of losses that are not likely to occur.  Spending too much time assessing and managing unlikely risks is to be avoided.  Unlikely events do occur but if the risk is unlikely enough to occur it may be better to simply retain the risk and deal with the result if the loss does in fact occur. Qualitative risk assessment is subjective and lacks consistency. The primary justification for a formal risk assessment process is legal and bureaucratic.\n\n==Areas==\nAs applied to [[corporate finance]], ''risk management'' is the technique for measuring, monitoring and controlling the financial or [[operational risk]] on a firm's [[balance sheet]], a traditional measure is the [[value at risk]] (VaR), but there also other measures like [[profit at risk]] (PaR) or [[margin at risk]]. The [[Basel II]] framework breaks risks into [[market risk]] (price risk), [[credit risk]] and operational risk and also specifies methods for calculating [[capital requirement]]s for each of these components.\n\nIn Information Technology, Risk management includes \"Incident Handling\", an action plan for dealing with intrusions, cyber-theft, denial of service, fire, floods, and other security-related events. According to the [[SANS Institute]],<ref>[https://www.sans.org/security-resources/glossary-of-terms/ SANS Glossary of Security Terms] Retrieved on 2016-11-13</ref> it is a six step process: Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Lessons Learned.\n\n===Enterprise===\n{{Main|Enterprise risk management}}\nIn enterprise risk management, a risk is defined as a possible event or circumstance that can have negative influences on the enterprise in question.  Its impact can be on the very existence, the resources (human and capital), the products and services, or the customers of the enterprise, as well as external impacts on society, markets, or the environment.  In a financial institution, enterprise risk management is normally thought of as the combination of credit risk, [[interest rate risk]] or [[asset liability management]], liquidity risk, market risk, and operational risk.\n\nIn the more general case, every probable risk can have a pre-formulated plan to deal with its possible consequences (to ensure ''contingency'' if the risk becomes a ''liability'').\n\nFrom the information above and the average cost per employee over time, or [[cost accrual ratio]], a project manager can estimate:\n\n* the cost associated with the risk if it arises, estimated by multiplying employee costs per unit time by the estimated time lost (''cost impact'', ''C'' where ''C = cost accrual ratio * S''){{abbreviations|date=September 2016}}.\n* the probable increase in time associated with a risk (''schedule variance due to risk'', ''Rs'' where Rs = P * S):\n** Sorting on this value puts the highest risks to the schedule first. This is intended to cause the greatest risks to the project to be attempted first so that risk is minimized as quickly as possible.\n** This is slightly misleading as ''schedule variances'' with a large P and small S and vice versa are not equivalent. (The risk of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] sinking vs. the passengers' meals being served at slightly the wrong time).\n* the probable increase in cost associated with a risk (''cost variance due to risk'', ''Rc'' where Rc = P*C = P*CAR*S = P*S*CAR)\n** sorting on this value puts the highest risks to the budget first.\n** see concerns about ''schedule variance'' as this is a function of it, as illustrated in the equation above.\n\nRisk in a [[project]] or [[business process|process]] can be due either to [[Special Cause Variation]] or [[Common Cause Variation]] and requires appropriate treatment.  That is to re-iterate the concern about extremal cases not being equivalent in the list immediately above.\n\n===Enterprise Security===\nESRM is a security program management approach that links security activities to an enterprise's mission and business goals through risk management methods. The security leader's role in ESRM is to manage risks of harm to enterprise assets in partnership with the business leaders whose assets are exposed to those risks. ESRM involves educating business leaders on the realistic impacts of identified risks, presenting potential strategies to mitigate those impacts, then enacting the option chosen by the business in line with accepted levels of business risk tolerance<ref>ASIS https://www.asisonline.org/publications--resources/news/blog/esrm-an-enduring-security-risk-model/</ref>\n\n===Medical device===\nFor medical devices, risk management is a process for identifying, evaluating and mitigating risks associated with harm to people and damage to property or the environment. Risk management is an integral part of medical device design and development, production processes and evaluation of field experience, and is applicable to all types of medical devices. The evidence of its application is required by most regulatory bodies such as the [[Food and Drug Administration|US FDA]]. The management of risks for medical devices is described by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in ISO 14971:2007, Medical Devices\u2014The application of risk management to medical devices, a product safety standard. The standard provides a process framework and associated requirements for management responsibilities, risk analysis and evaluation, risk controls and lifecycle risk management.\n\nThe European version of the risk management standard was updated in 2009 and again in 2012 to refer to the Medical Devices Directive (MDD) and Active Implantable Medical Device Directive (AIMDD) revision in 2007, as well as the In Vitro Medical Device Directive (IVDD). The requirements of EN 14971:2012 are nearly identical to ISO 14971:2007. The differences include three \"(informative)\" Z Annexes that refer to the new MDD, AIMDD, and IVDD.  These annexes indicate content deviations that include the requirement for risks to be reduced ''as far as possible'', and the requirement that risks be mitigated by design and not by labeling on the medical device (i.e., labeling can no longer be used to mitigate risk).\n\nTypical risk analysis and evaluation techniques adopted by the medical device industry include [[hazard analysis]], [[fault tree analysis]] (FTA), [[failure mode and effects analysis]] (FMEA), hazard and operability study ([[HAZOP]]), and risk traceability analysis for ensuring risk controls are implemented and effective (i.e. tracking risks identified to product requirements, design specifications, verification and validation results etc.). FTA analysis requires diagramming software. FMEA analysis can be done using a [[spreadsheet]] program. There are also integrated medical device risk management solutions.\n\nThrough a [https://www.fda.gov/medicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm206153.htm draft guidance], the FDA has introduced another method named \"Safety Assurance Case\" for medical device safety assurance analysis. The safety assurance case is structured argument reasoning about systems appropriate for scientists and engineers, supported by a body of evidence, that provides a compelling, comprehensible and valid case that a system is safe for a given application in a given environment. With the guidance, a safety assurance case is expected for safety critical devices (e.g. infusion devices) as part of the pre-market clearance submission, e.g. 510(k). In 2013, the FDA introduced another draft guidance expecting medical device manufacturers to submit cybersecurity risk analysis information.\n\n===Project management===\n{{Main| project risk management}}\nProject risk management must be considered at the different phases of acquisition.  In the beginning of a project, the advancement of technical developments, or threats presented by a competitor's projects, may cause a risk or threat assessment and subsequent evaluation of alternatives (see [[Analysis of Alternatives]]). Once a decision is made, and the project begun, more familiar project management applications can be used:<ref>Lev Virine and Michael Trumper. ''Project Decisions: The Art and Science''. (2007).

Plans should include risk management tasks, responsibilities, activities and budget.\n* Assigning a risk officer \u2013 a team member other than a project manager who is responsible for foreseeing potential project problems.  Typical characteristic of risk officer is a healthy skepticism.\n* Maintaining live project risk database.  Each risk should have the following attributes: opening date, title, short description, probability and importance.  Optionally a risk may have an assigned person responsible for its resolution and a date by which the risk must be resolved.\n* Creating anonymous risk reporting channel.  Each team member should have the possibility to report risks that he/she foresees in the project.\n* Preparing mitigation plans for risks that are chosen to be mitigated.  The purpose of the mitigation plan is to describe how this particular risk will be handled \u2013 what, when, by whom and how will it be done to avoid it or minimize consequences if it becomes a liability.\n* Summarizing planned and faced risks, effectiveness of mitigation activities, and effort spent for the risk management.\n\n===Megaprojects (infrastructure)===\n[[Megaproject]]s (sometimes also called \"major programs\") are large-scale investment projects, typically costing more than $1 billion per project. Megaprojects include major bridges, tunnels, highways, railways, airports, seaports, power plants, dams, wastewater projects, coastal flood protection schemes, oil and natural gas extraction projects, public buildings, information technology systems, aerospace projects, and defense systems.

Hazard identification and risk assessment tools and techniques are described in the international standard ISO 17776:2000, and organisations such as the IADC ([[International Association of Drilling Contractors]]) publish guidelines for [[Health, Safety and Environment]] (HSE) Case development which are based on the ISO standard. Further, diagrammatic representations of hazardous events are often expected by governmental regulators as part of risk management in safety case submissions; these are known as '''[[bow-tie diagram]]s''' (see [[Network theory in risk assessment]]). The technique is also used by organisations and regulators in mining, aviation, health, defence, industrial and finance.\n\n===Pharmaceutical sector===\nThe principles and tools for quality risk management are increasingly being applied to different aspects of pharmaceutical quality systems. These aspects include development, manufacturing, distribution, inspection, and submission/review processes throughout the lifecycle of drug substances, drug products, biological and biotechnological products (including the use of raw materials, solvents, excipients, packaging and labeling materials in drug products, biological and biotechnological products). Risk management is also applied to the assessment of [http://www.pharmamanufacturing.com/articles/2011/126.html microbiological contamination] in relation to pharmaceutical products and cleanroom manufacturing environments.<ref name=Sandle>{{cite book | author = Saghee M, Sandle T, Tidswell E (editors) | title = Microbiology and Sterility Assurance in Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices | edition = 1st | publisher = Business Horizons | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-8190646741}}</ref>\n\n==Risk communication==\nRisk communication is a complex cross-disciplinary academic field related to [[Value system|core values]] of the targeted audiences.<ref>[http://www.med.navy.mil/sites/nmcphc/Documents/policy-and-instruction/nmcphc-risk-communications-primer.pdf Risk Communication Primer\u2014Tools and Techniques].

Risk communication is somewhat related to [[crisis communication]]. Some experts coincide that risk is not only enrooted in the communication process but also it cannot be dissociated from the use of language.

Vocabulary.\"<ref name=voc/>\n\nIn ideal risk management, a prioritization process is followed whereby the risks with the greatest loss (or impact) and the greatest [[probability]] of occurring are handled first. Risks with lower probability of occurrence and lower loss are handled in descending order. In practice the process of assessing overall risk can be difficult, and balancing resources used to mitigate between risks with a high probability of occurrence but lower loss, versus a risk with high loss but lower probability of occurrence can often be mishandled.\n\nIntangible risk management identifies a new type of a risk that has a 100% probability of occurring but is ignored by the organization due to a lack of identification ability. For example, when deficient knowledge is applied to a situation, a [[knowledge]] risk materializes. Relationship risk appears when ineffective collaboration occurs. Process-engagement risk may be an issue when ineffective operational procedures are applied. These risks directly reduce the productivity of knowledge workers, decrease cost-effectiveness, profitability, service, quality, reputation, brand value, and earnings quality. Intangible risk management allows risk management to create immediate value from the identification and reduction of risks that reduce productivity.\n\nOpportunity cost represents a unique challenge for risk managers. It can be difficult to determine when to put resources toward risk management and when to use those resources elsewhere. Again, ideal risk management minimizes spending (or manpower or other resources) and also minimizes the negative effects of risks.\n\nRisk is defined as the possibility that an event will occur that adversely affects the achievement of an objective. Uncertainty, therefore, is a key aspect of risk.  Systems like the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Tradeway Commission Enterprise Risk Management (COSO ERM), can assist managers in mitigating risk factors.  Each company may have different internal control components, which leads to different outcomes. For example, the framework for ERM components includes Internal Environment, Objective Setting, Event Identification, Risk Assessment, Risk Response, Control Activities, Information and Communication, and Monitoring.\n\n===Method===\n\nFor the most part, these methods consist of the following elements, performed, more or less, in the following order.\n\n# Identify the threats\n# Assess the vulnerability of critical assets to specific threats\n# Determine the [[risk]] (i.e. the expected likelihood and consequences of specific types of attacks on specific assets)\n# Identify ways to reduce those risks\n# Prioritize risk reduction measures\n\n===Principles===\n\nThe [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) identifies the following principles of risk management:<ref name=\"iso3100\">{{Cite news |title=Committee Draft of ISO 31000 Risk management |publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]] |url=http://www.nsai.ie/uploads/file/N047_Committee_Draft_of_ISO_31000.pdf |format=PDF |publication-date=2007-06-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325160441/http://www.nsai.ie/uploads/file/N047_Committee_Draft_of_ISO_31000.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-25 }}</ref>\n\nRisk management should:\n* Create [[value (economics)|value]] \u2013 resources expended to mitigate risk should be less than the consequence of inaction\n* Be an integral part of organizational processes\n* Be part of decision making process\n* Explicitly address uncertainty and assumptions\n* Be a systematic and structured process\n* Be based on the best available information\n* Be tailorable\n* Take human factors into account\n* Be transparent and inclusive\n* Be dynamic, iterative and responsive to change\n* Be capable of continual improvement and enhancement\n* Be continually or periodically re-assessed\n\n==Process==\nAccording to the standard [[ISO 31000]] \"Risk management \u2013 Principles and guidelines on implementation,\"<ref name=iso /> the process of risk management consists of several steps as follows:\n\n===Establishing the context===\nThis involves:\n\n#observing the context\n#*the social scope of risk management\n#*the identity and objectives of [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]]\n#*the basis upon which risks will be evaluated, constraints.\n#defining a framework for the activity and an agenda for identification\n#developing an analysis of risks involved in the process\n#mitigation or solution of risks using available technological, human and organizational resources\n\n===Identification===\nAfter establishing the context, the next step in the process of managing risk is to identify potential risks.  Risks are about events that, when triggered, cause problems or benefits. Hence, risk identification can start with the source of our problems and those of our competitors (benefit), or with the problem consequenses.\n* Source analysis<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.madrid.org/cs/StaticFiles/Emprendedores/Analisis_Riesgos/pages/pdf/metodologia/3IdentificaciondelosRiesgos_en.pdf|title=Risk Identification|publisher=Comunidad de Madrid|page=3}}</ref> \u2013 Risk sources may be internal or external to the system that is the target of risk management (use mitigation instead of management since by its own definition risk deals with factors of decision-making that cannot be managed).\nExamples of risk sources are: stakeholders of a project, employees of a company or the weather over an airport.\n* Problem analysis{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} \u2013 Risks are related to identified threats. For example: the threat of losing money, the threat of abuse of confidential information or the threat of human errors, accidents and casualties. The threats may exist with various entities, most important with shareholders, customers and legislative bodies such as the government.\nWhen either source or problem is known, the events that a source may trigger or the events that can lead to a problem can be investigated. For example: stakeholders withdrawing during a project may endanger funding of the project; confidential information may be stolen by employees even within a closed network; lightning striking an aircraft during takeoff may make all people on board immediate casualties.\n\nThe chosen method of identifying risks may depend on culture, industry practice and compliance. The identification methods are formed by templates or the development of templates for identifying source, problem or event. Common risk identification methods are:\n* Objectives-based risk identification {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} \u2013 Organizations and project teams have objectives. Any event that may prevent an objective from being achieved is identified as risk.\n* Scenario-based risk identification \u2013 In [[scenario analysis]] different scenarios are created. The scenarios may be the alternative ways to achieve an objective, or an analysis of the interaction of forces in, for example, a market or battle. Any event that triggers an undesired scenario alternative is identified as risk \u2013 see [[Futures Studies]] for methodology used by [[Futurists]].\n* Taxonomy-based risk identification \u2013 The taxonomy in taxonomy-based risk identification is a breakdown of possible risk sources. Based on the taxonomy and knowledge of best practices, a questionnaire is compiled. The answers to the questions reveal risks.<ref>[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/abstracts/reports/93tr006.cfm CMU/SEI-93-TR-6 Taxonomy-based risk identification in software industry]. Sei.cmu.edu.

Creating a [[Risk matrix|matrix]] under these headings enables a variety of approaches. One can begin with resources and consider the threats they are exposed to and the consequences of each. Alternatively one can start with the threats and examine which resources they would affect, or one can begin with the consequences and determine which combination of threats and resources would be involved to bring them about.\n\n===Assessment===\n{{Main|Risk assessment}}\nOnce risks have been identified, they must then be assessed as to their potential severity of impact (generally a negative impact, such as damage or loss) and to the probability of occurrence. These quantities can be either simple to measure, in the case of the value of a lost building, or impossible to know for sure in the case of an unlikely event, the probability of occurrence of which is unknown. Therefore, in the assessment process it is critical to make the best educated decisions in order to properly prioritize the implementation of the [[risk management plan]].\n\nEven a short-term positive improvement can have long-term negative impacts.  Take the \"turnpike\" example. A highway is widened to allow more traffic. More traffic capacity leads to greater development in the areas surrounding the improved traffic capacity. Over time, traffic thereby increases to fill available capacity. Turnpikes thereby need to be expanded in a seemingly endless cycles. There are many other engineering examples where expanded capacity (to do any function) is soon filled by increased demand. Since expansion comes at a cost, the resulting growth could become unsustainable without forecasting and management.\n\nThe fundamental difficulty in risk assessment is determining the rate of occurrence since statistical information is not available on all kinds of past incidents and is particularly scanty in the case of catastrophic events, simply because of their infrequency. Furthermore, evaluating the severity of the consequences (impact) is often quite difficult for intangible assets. Asset valuation is another question that needs to be addressed. Thus, best educated opinions and available statistics are the primary sources of information. Nevertheless, risk assessment should produce such information for senior executives of the organization that the primary risks are easy to understand and that the risk management decisions may be prioritized within overall company goals. Thus, there have been several theories and attempts to quantify risks. Numerous different risk formulae exist, but perhaps the most widely accepted formula for risk quantification is: \"Rate (or probability) of occurrence multiplied by the impact of the event equals risk magnitude.\"{{vague|section|date=January 2016}}\n\n==Risk options==\nRisk mitigation measures are usually formulated according to one or more of the following major risk options, which are:\n\n#Design a new business process with adequate built-in risk control and containment measures from the start.\n#Periodically re-assess risks that are accepted in ongoing processes as a normal feature of business operations and modify mitigation measures.\n#Transfer risks to an external agency (e.g. an insurance company)\n#Avoid risks altogether (e.g. by closing down a particular high-risk business area)\n\nLater research<ref>{{cite web|title=CRISC Exam Questions|url=https://www.dumpsbook.com/Exam/CRISC|accessdate= 23 Feb 2018}}</ref> has shown that the financial benefits of risk management are less dependent on the formula used but are more dependent on the frequency and how risk assessment is performed.\n\nIn business it is imperative to be able to present the findings of risk assessments in financial, market, or schedule terms. Robert Courtney Jr. (IBM, 1970) proposed a formula for presenting risks in financial terms. The Courtney formula was accepted as the official risk analysis method for the US governmental agencies. The formula proposes calculation of ALE (annualized loss expectancy) and compares the expected loss value to the security control implementation costs ([[cost-benefit analysis]]).\n\n===Potential risk treatments===\nOnce risks have been identified and assessed, all techniques to manage the risk fall into one or more of these four major categories:<ref>{{cite book |last=Dorfman|first=Mark S. |title=Introduction to Risk Management and Insurance|edition=9 |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-13-224227-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n* Avoidance (eliminate, withdraw from or not become involved)\n* Reduction (optimize \u2013 mitigate)\n* Sharing (transfer \u2013 outsource or insure)\n* Retention (accept and budget)\n\nIdeal use of these [[risk control strategies]] may not be possible.  Some of them may involve trade-offs that are not acceptable to the organization or person making the risk management decisions. Another source, from the US Department of Defense (see link), [[Defense Acquisition University]], calls these categories ACAT, for Avoid, Control, Accept, or Transfer.  This use of the ACAT acronym is reminiscent of another ACAT (for Acquisition Category) used in US Defense industry procurements, in which Risk Management figures prominently in decision making and planning.\n\n====Risk avoidance====\nThis includes not performing an activity that could present risk. Refusing to purchase a [[Real property|property]] or business to avoid [[legal liability]] is one such example.  Avoiding [[airplane]] flights for fear of [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacking]].  Avoidance may seem like the answer to all risks, but avoiding risks also means losing out on the potential gain that accepting (retaining) the risk may have allowed.  Not entering a business to avoid the risk of loss also avoids the possibility of earning profits.  Increasing risk regulation in hospitals has led to avoidance of treating higher risk conditions, in favor of patients presenting with lower risk.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McGivern|first=Gerry|author2=Fischer, Michael D. |title=Reactivity and reactions to regulatory transparency in medicine, psychotherapy and counseling|journal=Social Science & Medicine|date=1 February 2012|volume=74|issue=3|pages=289\u2013296|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.09.035|pmid=22104085|url=http://eureka.sbs.ox.ac.uk/4314/1/McGivern_G___Fischer_M_D__%282012%29_Reactivity_and_Reactions_to_Regulatory_Transparency_in_Medicine_Psychotherapy_and_Counselling_%28Authors%27_version%29.pdf}}</ref>\n\n====Risk reduction====\nRisk reduction or \"optimization\" involves reducing the severity of the loss or the likelihood of the loss from occurring.  For example, [[Fire sprinkler|sprinkler]]s are designed to put out a [[fire]] to reduce the risk of loss by fire.  This method may cause a greater loss by water damage and therefore may not be suitable. [[Halomethane|Halon]] fire suppression systems may mitigate that risk, but the cost may be prohibitive as a [[strategy]].\n\nAcknowledging that risks can be positive or negative, optimizing risks means finding a balance between negative risk and the benefit of the operation or activity; and between risk reduction and effort applied. By effectively applying [[Health, Safety and Environment]] (HSE) management standards, organizations can achieve tolerable levels of [[residual risk]].<ref>[https://www.iadc.org/ebookstore/ebook-iadc-hse-case-guidelines-for-mobile-offshore-drilling-units/ IADC HSE Case Guidelines for Mobile Offshore Drilling Units] 3.2, section 4.7</ref>\n\nModern software development methodologies reduce risk by developing and delivering software incrementally.  Early methodologies suffered from the fact that they only delivered software in the final phase of development; any problems encountered in earlier phases meant costly rework and often jeopardized the whole project.  By developing in iterations, software projects can limit effort wasted to a single iteration.\n\n[[Outsourcing]] could be an example of risk sharing strategy if the outsourcer can demonstrate higher capability at managing or reducing risks.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Roehrig|first=P|year=2006|url=http://www.btquarterly.com/?mc=bet-governance&page=ss-viewresearch|title=Bet On Governance To Manage Outsourcing Risk|journal=Business Trends Quarterly}}</ref> For example, a company may outsource only its software development, the manufacturing of hard goods, or customer support needs to another company, while handling the business management itself.  This way, the company can concentrate more on business development without having to worry as much about the manufacturing process, managing the development team, or finding a physical location for a center.\n\n====Risk sharing====\nBriefly defined as \"sharing with another party the burden of loss or the benefit of gain, from a risk, and the measures to reduce a risk.\"\n\nThe term of 'risk transfer' is often used in place of risk sharing in the mistaken belief that you can transfer a risk to a third party through insurance or outsourcing. In practice if the insurance company or contractor go bankrupt or end up in court, the original risk is likely to still revert to the first party. As such, in the terminology of practitioners and scholars alike, the purchase of an insurance contract is often described as a \"transfer of risk.\" However, technically speaking, the buyer of the contract generally retains legal responsibility for the losses \"transferred\", meaning that insurance may be described more accurately as a post-event compensatory mechanism. For example, a personal injuries insurance policy does not transfer the risk of a car accident to the insurance company. The risk still lies with the policy holder namely the person who has been in the accident. The insurance policy simply provides that if an accident (the event) occurs involving the policy holder then some compensation may be payable to the policy holder that is commensurate with the suffering/damage.\n\nMethods of managing risk fall into multiple categories. Risk retention pools are technically retaining the risk for the group, but spreading it over the whole group involves transfer among individual members of the group. This is different from traditional insurance, in that no premium is exchanged between members of the group up front, but instead losses are assessed to all members of the group.\n\n====Risk retention====\nRisk retention involves accepting the loss, or benefit of gain, from a risk when the incident occurs.  True [[self-insurance]] falls in this category.  Risk retention is a viable strategy for small risks where the cost of insuring against the risk would be greater over time than the total losses sustained. All risks that are not avoided or transferred are retained by default.  This includes risks that are so large or catastrophic that either they cannot be insured against or the premiums would be infeasible. [[War]] is an example since most property and risks are not insured against war, so the loss attributed to war is retained by the insured.  Also any amounts of potential loss (risk) over the amount insured is retained risk.  This may also be acceptable if the chance of a very large loss is small or if the cost to insure for greater coverage amounts is so great that it would hinder the goals of the organization too much.\n\n===Risk management plan===\n{{main|Risk management plan}}\n\nSelect appropriate controls or countermeasures to mitigate each risk. Risk mitigation needs to be approved by the appropriate level of management. For instance, a risk concerning the image of the organization should have top management decision behind it whereas IT management would have the authority to decide on computer virus risks.\n\nThe risk management plan should propose applicable and effective security controls for managing the risks. For example, an observed high risk of computer viruses could be mitigated by acquiring and implementing antivirus software. A good risk management plan should contain a schedule for control implementation and responsible persons for those actions.\n\nAccording to [[ISO/IEC 27001]], the stage immediately after completion of the [[risk assessment]] phase consists of preparing a Risk Treatment Plan, which should document the decisions about how each of the identified risks should be handled.  Mitigation of risks often means selection of [[security controls]], which should be documented in a Statement of Applicability, which identifies which particular control objectives and controls from the \nstandard have been selected, and why.\n\n===Implementation===\nImplementation follows all of the planned methods for mitigating the effect of the risks.  Purchase insurance policies for the risks that it has been decided to transferred to an insurer, avoid all risks that can be avoided without sacrificing the entity's goals, reduce others, and retain the rest.\n\n===Review and evaluation of the plan===\nInitial risk management plans will never be perfect. Practice, experience, and actual loss results will necessitate changes in the plan and contribute information to allow possible different decisions to be made in dealing with the risks being faced.\n\n[[Risk analysis (business)|Risk analysis]] results and management plans should be updated periodically. There are two primary reasons for this: \n# to evaluate whether the previously selected security controls are still applicable and effective\n# to evaluate the possible risk level changes in the business environment. For example, information risks are a good example of rapidly changing business environment.\n\n==Limitations==\nPrioritizing the ''risk management processes'' too highly could keep an organization from ever completing a project or even getting started.  This is especially true if other work is suspended until the risk management process is considered complete.\n\nIt is also important to keep in mind the distinction between risk and [[uncertainty]]. Risk can be measured by impacts \u00d7 probability.\n\nIf risks are improperly assessed and prioritized, time can be wasted in dealing with risk of losses that are not likely to occur.  Spending too much time assessing and managing unlikely risks is to be avoided.  Unlikely events do occur but if the risk is unlikely enough to occur it may be better to simply retain the risk and deal with the result if the loss does in fact occur. Qualitative risk assessment is subjective and lacks consistency. The primary justification for a formal risk assessment process is legal and bureaucratic.\n\n==Areas==\nAs applied to [[corporate finance]], ''risk management'' is the technique for measuring, monitoring and controlling the financial or [[operational risk]] on a firm's [[balance sheet]], a traditional measure is the [[value at risk]] (VaR), but there also other measures like [[profit at risk]] (PaR) or [[margin at risk]]. The [[Basel II]] framework breaks risks into [[market risk]] (price risk), [[credit risk]] and operational risk and also specifies methods for calculating [[capital requirement]]s for each of these components.\n\nIn Information Technology, Risk management includes \"Incident Handling\", an action plan for dealing with intrusions, cyber-theft, denial of service, fire, floods, and other security-related events. According to the [[SANS Institute]],<ref>[https://www.sans.org/security-resources/glossary-of-terms/ SANS Glossary of Security Terms] Retrieved on 2016-11-13</ref> it is a six step process: Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Lessons Learned.\n\n===Enterprise===\n{{Main|Enterprise risk management}}\nIn enterprise risk management, a risk is defined as a possible event or circumstance that can have negative influences on the enterprise in question.  Its impact can be on the very existence, the resources (human and capital), the products and services, or the customers of the enterprise, as well as external impacts on society, markets, or the environment.  In a financial institution, enterprise risk management is normally thought of as the combination of credit risk, [[interest rate risk]] or [[asset liability management]], liquidity risk, market risk, and operational risk.\n\nIn the more general case, every probable risk can have a pre-formulated plan to deal with its possible consequences (to ensure ''contingency'' if the risk becomes a ''liability'').\n\nFrom the information above and the average cost per employee over time, or [[cost accrual ratio]], a project manager can estimate:\n\n* the cost associated with the risk if it arises, estimated by multiplying employee costs per unit time by the estimated time lost (''cost impact'', ''C'' where ''C = cost accrual ratio * S''){{abbreviations|date=September 2016}}.\n* the probable increase in time associated with a risk (''schedule variance due to risk'', ''Rs'' where Rs = P * S):\n** Sorting on this value puts the highest risks to the schedule first. This is intended to cause the greatest risks to the project to be attempted first so that risk is minimized as quickly as possible.\n** This is slightly misleading as ''schedule variances'' with a large P and small S and vice versa are not equivalent. (The risk of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] sinking vs. the passengers' meals being served at slightly the wrong time).\n* the probable increase in cost associated with a risk (''cost variance due to risk'', ''Rc'' where Rc = P*C = P*CAR*S = P*S*CAR)\n** sorting on this value puts the highest risks to the budget first.\n** see concerns about ''schedule variance'' as this is a function of it, as illustrated in the equation above.\n\nRisk in a [[project]] or [[business process|process]] can be due either to [[Special Cause Variation]] or [[Common Cause Variation]] and requires appropriate treatment.  That is to re-iterate the concern about extremal cases not being equivalent in the list immediately above.\n\n===Enterprise Security===\nESRM is a security program management approach that links security activities to an enterprise's mission and business goals through risk management methods. The security leader's role in ESRM is to manage risks of harm to enterprise assets in partnership with the business leaders whose assets are exposed to those risks. ESRM involves educating business leaders on the realistic impacts of identified risks, presenting potential strategies to mitigate those impacts, then enacting the option chosen by the business in line with accepted levels of business risk tolerance<ref>ASIS https://www.asisonline.org/publications--resources/news/blog/esrm-an-enduring-security-risk-model/</ref>\n\n===Medical device===\nFor medical devices, risk management is a process for identifying, evaluating and mitigating risks associated with harm to people and damage to property or the environment. Risk management is an integral part of medical device design and development, production processes and evaluation of field experience, and is applicable to all types of medical devices. The evidence of its application is required by most regulatory bodies such as the [[Food and Drug Administration|US FDA]]. The management of risks for medical devices is described by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in ISO 14971:2007, Medical Devices\u2014The application of risk management to medical devices, a product safety standard. The standard provides a process framework and associated requirements for management responsibilities, risk analysis and evaluation, risk controls and lifecycle risk management.\n\nThe European version of the risk management standard was updated in 2009 and again in 2012 to refer to the Medical Devices Directive (MDD) and Active Implantable Medical Device Directive (AIMDD) revision in 2007, as well as the In Vitro Medical Device Directive (IVDD). The requirements of EN 14971:2012 are nearly identical to ISO 14971:2007. The differences include three \"(informative)\" Z Annexes that refer to the new MDD, AIMDD, and IVDD.  These annexes indicate content deviations that include the requirement for risks to be reduced ''as far as possible'', and the requirement that risks be mitigated by design and not by labeling on the medical device (i.e., labeling can no longer be used to mitigate risk).\n\nTypical risk analysis and evaluation techniques adopted by the medical device industry include [[hazard analysis]], [[fault tree analysis]] (FTA), [[failure mode and effects analysis]] (FMEA), hazard and operability study ([[HAZOP]]), and risk traceability analysis for ensuring risk controls are implemented and effective (i.e. tracking risks identified to product requirements, design specifications, verification and validation results etc.). FTA analysis requires diagramming software. FMEA analysis can be done using a [[spreadsheet]] program. There are also integrated medical device risk management solutions.\n\nThrough a [https://www.fda.gov/medicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm206153.htm draft guidance], the FDA has introduced another method named \"Safety Assurance Case\" for medical device safety assurance analysis. The safety assurance case is structured argument reasoning about systems appropriate for scientists and engineers, supported by a body of evidence, that provides a compelling, comprehensible and valid case that a system is safe for a given application in a given environment. With the guidance, a safety assurance case is expected for safety critical devices (e.g. infusion devices) as part of the pre-market clearance submission, e.g. 510(k). In 2013, the FDA introduced another draft guidance expecting medical device manufacturers to submit cybersecurity risk analysis information.\n\n===Project management===\n{{Main| project risk management}}\nProject risk management must be considered at the different phases of acquisition.  In the beginning of a project, the advancement of technical developments, or threats presented by a competitor's projects, may cause a risk or threat assessment and subsequent evaluation of alternatives (see [[Analysis of Alternatives]]). Once a decision is made, and the project begun, more familiar project management applications can be used:<ref>Lev Virine and Michael Trumper. ''Project Decisions: The Art and Science''. (2007).

Plans should include risk management tasks, responsibilities, activities and budget.\n* Assigning a risk officer \u2013 a team member other than a project manager who is responsible for foreseeing potential project problems.  Typical characteristic of risk officer is a healthy skepticism.\n* Maintaining live project risk database.  Each risk should have the following attributes: opening date, title, short description, probability and importance.  Optionally a risk may have an assigned person responsible for its resolution and a date by which the risk must be resolved.\n* Creating anonymous risk reporting channel.  Each team member should have the possibility to report risks that he/she foresees in the project.\n* Preparing mitigation plans for risks that are chosen to be mitigated.  The purpose of the mitigation plan is to describe how this particular risk will be handled \u2013 what, when, by whom and how will it be done to avoid it or minimize consequences if it becomes a liability.\n* Summarizing planned and faced risks, effectiveness of mitigation activities, and effort spent for the risk management.\n\n===Megaprojects (infrastructure)===\n[[Megaproject]]s (sometimes also called \"major programs\") are large-scale investment projects, typically costing more than $1 billion per project. Megaprojects include major bridges, tunnels, highways, railways, airports, seaports, power plants, dams, wastewater projects, coastal flood protection schemes, oil and natural gas extraction projects, public buildings, information technology systems, aerospace projects, and defense systems. Megaprojects have been shown to be particularly risky in terms of finance, safety, and social and environmental impacts.<ref name=\"Megaprojects and Risk\">{{cite book|first=Bent|last=Flyvbjerg|title=Megaprojects and Risk: An Anatomy of Ambition|publisher=Cambridge University Press|ISBN=0521804205|year=2003}}</ref> Risk management is therefore particularly pertinent for megaprojects and special methods and special education have been developed for such risk management.<ref>[[Oxford BT Centre for Major Programme Management]]</ref>\n\n===Natural disasters===\nIt is important to assess risk in regard to natural disasters like [[Flood risk assessment|floods]], [[seismic hazard|earthquakes]], and so on.

This is a relatively new term due to an increasing awareness that [[information security]] is simply one facet of a multitude of risks that are relevant to IT and the real world processes it supports. \"Cybersecurity is tied closely to the advancement of technology.

Hazard identification and risk assessment tools and techniques are described in the international standard ISO 17776:2000, and organisations such as the IADC ([[International Association of Drilling Contractors]]) publish guidelines for [[Health, Safety and Environment]] (HSE) Case development which are based on the ISO standard. Further, diagrammatic representations of hazardous events are often expected by governmental regulators as part of risk management in safety case submissions; these are known as '''[[bow-tie diagram]]s''' (see [[Network theory in risk assessment]]). The technique is also used by organisations and regulators in mining, aviation, health, defence, industrial and finance.\n\n===Pharmaceutical sector===\nThe principles and tools for quality risk management are increasingly being applied to different aspects of pharmaceutical quality systems. These aspects include development, manufacturing, distribution, inspection, and submission/review processes throughout the lifecycle of drug substances, drug products, biological and biotechnological products (including the use of raw materials, solvents, excipients, packaging and labeling materials in drug products, biological and biotechnological products). Risk management is also applied to the assessment of [http://www.pharmamanufacturing.com/articles/2011/126.html microbiological contamination] in relation to pharmaceutical products and cleanroom manufacturing environments.<ref name=Sandle>{{cite book | author = Saghee M, Sandle T, Tidswell E (editors) | title = Microbiology and Sterility Assurance in Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices | edition = 1st | publisher = Business Horizons | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-8190646741}}</ref>\n\n==Risk communication==\nRisk communication is a complex cross-disciplinary academic field related to [[Value system|core values]] of the targeted audiences.<ref>[http://www.med.navy.mil/sites/nmcphc/Documents/policy-and-instruction/nmcphc-risk-communications-primer.pdf Risk Communication Primer\u2014Tools and Techniques].

Risk communication is somewhat related to [[crisis communication]].

Two primary mechanisms for research are Working Groups and Investigative Workshops.  Working Groups are composed of 10-15 invited participants focusing on specific questions related to mathematical biology. Each group typically meets at the Institute two to three times over the course of two years. Investigative workshops may include 30-40 participants with some invited by organizers and others accepted through an open application process. Workshops are more general in focus and may lead to working group formation.  NIMBioS also provides support for post-doctoral and sabbatical fellows, short-term visitors, graduate research assistants, and faculty collaborators at UT.\n\n== Function ==\nOne area of particular emphasis at NIMBioS has been modeling animal infectious diseases, such as [[white-nose syndrome]] in bats, pseudo-rabies virus in feral swine, [[Toxoplasma gondii]] in cats, and [[malaria]] from mosquitoes. As a leading international center for animal infectious disease modeling, NIMBioS has contributed significantly to global needs in analyzing the potential spread, impact and control of diseases that can move from animals to humans, such as West Nile virus, anthrax, swine flu and mad cow disease.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://quest.utk.edu/2009/nimbios/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303213259/http://quest.utk.edu/2009/nimbios/ |archive-date=2016-03-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> NIMBioS also collaborates with the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]] to develop methods of particular interest for natural area management that are transferable to numerous U.S. locations. \n\nNIMBioS encourages multidisciplinary participation in all its activities. Participants at NIMBioS have included behavioral biologists, ecologists, evolutionary biologists, computational scientists, anthropologists, geneticists, psychologists, bioinformaticians, mathematicians, statisticians, veterinarians, epidemiologists, and wildlife biologists.\n\nNIMBioS has an active Education and Outreach program geared toward learners of all ages, from elementary school students through college and graduate school and the general public. NIMBioS organizes a Summer Research Experience for Undergraduates and Teachers program for eight weeks each summer. Participants live on campus and conduct research in teams with UT professors, NIMBioS researchers, and collaborators on projects at the interface of math and biology. NIMBioS also hosts the annual Undergraduate Research Conference at the Interface of Biology and Mathematics each fall, featuring student talks and posters as well as panel discussions. Programs for graduate students include the Visiting Graduate Student Fellowship offering training and research visits for up to several months by graduate students interested in pursuing research with NIMBioS senior personnel, postdoctoral fellows or working group participants.\n\nNIMBioS provides varying levels of tutorial workshops designed to enlighten biologists about key quantitative methods, such as optimal control and optimization or high performance computing methods for analyzing biological problems involving large data sets, spatial information, and dynamics. \n\n== Director ==\nNIMBioS\u2019 director is [[Louis J. Gross]], Professor of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology and Mathematics at the UT. NIMBioS leadership team also includes associate directors and a deputy director. NIMBioS has an external Board of Advisors from academic institutions from around the world. In addition, NIMBioS has a group of senior personnel consisting of UT faculty and [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (ORNL) scientists, as well as a group of additional associated faculty and staff collaborators from UT and ORNL.\n\n== Research ==\nThe need for the Institute arose out of the significant growth of the field of mathematical biology over the last decade with research becoming more closely linked to observation and experiment. Rather than starting from mathematical abstractions, it is now common for researchers to: \n\n1) Begin with observations;  \n\n2) Use those to suggest promising methods, tools and models; and  \n\n3) Proceed to analysis, simulation, evaluation and application.  \n\nAcross the spectrum of the life sciences in which mathematics has been contributing new insights, data are increasingly used to focus conceptual models as the first step in problem formulation. \n\n== Website description ==\nThe NIMBioS website includes descriptions of working groups, investigative workshops, post-doctoral fellowships, sabbaticals, short-term visits, graduate assistantships, and faculty positions and information on how to submit requests for support. The web site also describes education and outreach opportunities for undergraduates, teachers, and K-12 students. The web site also has an extensive video library including interviews with visiting scientists, full-length seminars tutorials, and workshops, and short narrative science features.\n\n== Sponsorship ==\nFrom 2010 to 2012, NIMBioS, in conjunction with the UT's James R. Cox Endowment Fund, sponsored a Songwriter-in-Residence Program to encourage the creation and production of songs involving ideas of modern biology and the lives of scientists who pursue research in biology. A total of five songwriters were supported. Each songwriter created and produced a minimum of two songs as a result of his or her four-week residency.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis: [http://www.nimbios.org www.nimbios.org  official website]\n\n[[Category:Bioinformatics organizations]]\n[[Category:Biostatistics]]\n[[Category:Mathematical and theoretical biology|*]]\n[[Category:Biotechnology organizations]]\n[[Category:Organizations based in Tennessee]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=May 2016}}{{Infobox institute\n| name = National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis\n| focus = [[science]]<br>[[mathematics]]<br>[[biology]]\n| established = Mrach 2009\n| location = [[University of Tennessee]], [[Knoxville]]\n| key_people = [[Louis J.

NIMBioS also provides support for post-doctoral and sabbatical fellows, short-term visitors, graduate research assistants, and faculty collaborators at UT.\n\n== Function ==\nOne area of particular emphasis at NIMBioS has been modeling animal infectious diseases, such as [[white-nose syndrome]] in bats, pseudo-rabies virus in feral swine, [[Toxoplasma gondii]] in cats, and [[malaria]] from mosquitoes. As a leading international center for animal infectious disease modeling, NIMBioS has contributed significantly to global needs in analyzing the potential spread, impact and control of diseases that can move from animals to humans, such as West Nile virus, anthrax, swine flu and mad cow disease.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://quest.utk.edu/2009/nimbios/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303213259/http://quest.utk.edu/2009/nimbios/ |archive-date=2016-03-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> NIMBioS also collaborates with the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]] to develop methods of particular interest for natural area management that are transferable to numerous U.S. locations. \n\nNIMBioS encourages multidisciplinary participation in all its activities. Participants at NIMBioS have included behavioral biologists, ecologists, evolutionary biologists, computational scientists, anthropologists, geneticists, psychologists, bioinformaticians, mathematicians, statisticians, veterinarians, epidemiologists, and wildlife biologists.\n\nNIMBioS has an active Education and Outreach program geared toward learners of all ages, from elementary school students through college and graduate school and the general public. NIMBioS organizes a Summer Research Experience for Undergraduates and Teachers program for eight weeks each summer. Participants live on campus and conduct research in teams with UT professors, NIMBioS researchers, and collaborators on projects at the interface of math and biology. NIMBioS also hosts the annual Undergraduate Research Conference at the Interface of Biology and Mathematics each fall, featuring student talks and posters as well as panel discussions. Programs for graduate students include the Visiting Graduate Student Fellowship offering training and research visits for up to several months by graduate students interested in pursuing research with NIMBioS senior personnel, postdoctoral fellows or working group participants.\n\nNIMBioS provides varying levels of tutorial workshops designed to enlighten biologists about key quantitative methods, such as optimal control and optimization or high performance computing methods for analyzing biological problems involving large data sets, spatial information, and dynamics. \n\n== Director ==\nNIMBioS\u2019 director is [[Louis J. Gross]], Professor of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology and Mathematics at the UT. NIMBioS leadership team also includes associate directors and a deputy director. NIMBioS has an external Board of Advisors from academic institutions from around the world. In addition, NIMBioS has a group of senior personnel consisting of UT faculty and [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (ORNL) scientists, as well as a group of additional associated faculty and staff collaborators from UT and ORNL.\n\n== Research ==\nThe need for the Institute arose out of the significant growth of the field of mathematical biology over the last decade with research becoming more closely linked to observation and experiment. Rather than starting from mathematical abstractions, it is now common for researchers to: \n\n1) Begin with observations;  \n\n2) Use those to suggest promising methods, tools and models; and  \n\n3) Proceed to analysis, simulation, evaluation and application.  \n\nAcross the spectrum of the life sciences in which mathematics has been contributing new insights, data are increasingly used to focus conceptual models as the first step in problem formulation. \n\n== Website description ==\nThe NIMBioS website includes descriptions of working groups, investigative workshops, post-doctoral fellowships, sabbaticals, short-term visits, graduate assistantships, and faculty positions and information on how to submit requests for support. The web site also describes education and outreach opportunities for undergraduates, teachers, and K-12 students. The web site also has an extensive video library including interviews with visiting scientists, full-length seminars tutorials, and workshops, and short narrative science features.\n\n== Sponsorship ==\nFrom 2010 to 2012, NIMBioS, in conjunction with the UT's James R. Cox Endowment Fund, sponsored a Songwriter-in-Residence Program to encourage the creation and production of songs involving ideas of modern biology and the lives of scientists who pursue research in biology. A total of five songwriters were supported. Each songwriter created and produced a minimum of two songs as a result of his or her four-week residency.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis: [http://www.nimbios.org www.nimbios.org  official website]\n\n[[Category:Bioinformatics organizations]]\n[[Category:Biostatistics]]\n[[Category:Mathematical and theoretical biology|*]]\n[[Category:Biotechnology organizations]]\n[[Category:Organizations based in Tennessee]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_for_Mathematical_and_Biological_Synthesis"}

Of these, 28,901 (57 percent) were autologous and 21,516 (43 percent) were allogeneic (11,928 from family donors and 9,588 from unrelated donors).

The patient is then treated with high-dose [[chemotherapy]] with or without [[radiotherapy]] with the intention of eradicating the patient's malignant cell population at the cost of partial or complete [[bone marrow]] ablation (destruction of patient's bone marrow's ability to grow new blood cells).  The patient's own stored stem cells are then transfused into his/her bloodstream, where they replace destroyed tissue and resume the patient's normal blood cell production. Autologous transplants have the advantage of lower risk of infection during the immune-compromised portion of the treatment since the recovery of immune function is rapid. Also, the incidence of patients experiencing rejection is very rare (and [[graft-versus-host disease]] impossible) due to the donor and recipient being the same individual. These advantages have established autologous HSCT as one of the standard second-line treatments for such diseases as [[lymphoma]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Canellos, George |title=Lymphoma Update: 1997 |journal=The Oncologist |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=181\u201383 |year=1997}}</ref>\n\nHowever, for other cancers such as [[acute myeloid leukemia]], the reduced mortality of the autogenous relative to allogeneic HSCT may be outweighed by an increased likelihood of cancer relapse and related mortality, and therefore the allogeneic treatment may be preferred for those conditions.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Bruno B, Rotta M, Patriarca F, et al. |title=A comparison of allografting with autografting for newly diagnosed myeloma |journal=N.

Allogeneic HSC donors must have a tissue ([[human leukocyte antigen]], HLA) type that matches the recipient. Matching is performed on the basis of variability at three or more [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] of the HLA gene, and a perfect match at these loci is preferred. Even if there is a good match at these critical [[Allele|alleles]], the recipient will require [[Immunosuppression|immunosuppressive]] medications to mitigate [[graft-versus-host disease]]. Allogeneic transplant donors may be ''related'' (usually a closely HLA matched sibling), ''syngeneic'' (a [[monozygotic]] or 'identical' twin of the patient \u2013 necessarily extremely rare since few patients have an identical twin, but offering a source of perfectly HLA matched stem cells) or ''unrelated'' (donor who is not related and found to have very close degree of HLA matching). Unrelated donors may be found through a registry of bone marrow donors, such as the [[National Marrow Donor Program]] in the U.S. People who would like to be tested for a specific family member or friend without joining any of the bone marrow registry data banks may contact a private HLA testing laboratory and be tested with a blood test or mouth swab to see if they are a potential match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bonemarrowtest.com/marrowdonoroptions.htm|title=Public registry or private donation? - Information - BoneMarrowTest.com - Private HLA Testing, Stem Cell Transplantation Resources|last=Kate|website=www.bonemarrowtest.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115175514/http://www.bonemarrowtest.com/marrowdonoroptions.htm|archivedate=15 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  A \"[[savior sibling]]\" may be intentionally selected by [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] in order to match a child both regarding HLA type and being free of any obvious inheritable disorder.

In general, mismatches of the Type-I genes (i.e. [[HLA-A]], [[HLA-B]], or [[HLA-C]]) increase the risk of graft rejection.  A mismatch of an HLA Type II gene (i.e. [[HLA-DR]], or [[HLA-DQB1]]) increases the risk of graft-versus-host disease.  In addition, a genetic mismatch as small as a single [[DNA]] [[base pair]] is significant so perfect matches require knowledge of the exact DNA sequence of these genes for both donor and recipient.

About 25 to 30 percent of allogeneic HSCT recipients have an HLA-identical sibling. Even so-called \"perfect matches\" may have mismatched minor alleles that contribute to graft-versus-host disease.\n\n===Bone marrow===\n[[Image:Bone marrow biopsy.jpg|thumb|Bone marrow harvest.]]\nIn the case of a bone marrow transplant, the HSC are removed from a large bone of the donor, typically the [[pelvis]], through a large [[Hypodermic needle|needle]] that reaches the center of the bone. The technique is referred to as a bone marrow harvest and is performed under [[Local anesthesia|local]] or [[general anesthesia]].\n\n===Peripheral blood stem cells===\n{{Main|Peripheral stem cell transplantation}}\n[[File:Hematopoietic stem cell.jpg|thumb|Peripheral blood stem cells]]\nPeripheral blood stem cells<ref name=\"Cutler\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Cutler C, Antin JH |title=Peripheral blood stem cells for allogeneic transplantation: a review |journal=[[Stem Cells]] |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=108\u201317 |year=2001 |pmid=11239165 |doi=10.1634/stemcells.19-2-108}}</ref> are now the most common source of stem cells for HSCT. They are collected from the blood through a process known as [[apheresis]]. The donor's blood is withdrawn through a sterile needle in one arm and passed through a machine that removes [[white blood cells]]. The [[red blood cells]] are returned to the donor. The peripheral stem cell yield is boosted with daily [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous injections]] of [[granulocyte-colony stimulating factor]], serving to mobilize stem cells from the donor's bone marrow into the peripheral circulation.\n\n===Amniotic fluid===\nIt is also possible to extract stem cells from [[amniotic fluid]] for both [[Autotransplantation|autologous]] or [[Xenotransplantation|heterologous]] use at the time of childbirth.\n\n===Umbilical cord blood===\nUmbilical [[cord blood]] is obtained when a mother donates her infant's [[umbilical cord]] and [[placenta]] after birth. [[Cord blood]] has a higher concentration of HSC than is normally found in adult blood.  However, the small quantity of blood obtained from an umbilical cord (typically about 50 mL) makes it more suitable for transplantation into small children than into adults.  Newer techniques using ''ex vivo'' expansion of cord blood units or the use of two cord blood units from different donors allow cord blood transplants to be used in adults.\n\nCord blood can be harvested from the umbilical cord of a child being born after [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (PGD) for [[human leukocyte antigen]] (HLA) matching (see [[PGD for HLA matching]]) in order to donate to an ill sibling requiring HSCT.\n\n===Storage of HSC===\nUnlike other organs, bone marrow cells can be frozen ([[cryopreserved]]) for prolonged periods without damaging too many cells. This is a necessity with autologous HSC because the cells must be harvested from the recipient months in advance of the transplant treatment. In the case of [[Allogeneic|allogeneic transplants]], fresh HSC are preferred in order to avoid cell loss that might occur during the freezing and thawing process. Allogeneic [[cord blood]] is stored frozen at a [[cord blood bank]] because it is only obtainable at the time of [[childbirth]]. To cryopreserve HSC, a preservative, [[dimethyl sulfoxide]], must be added, and the cells must be cooled very slowly in a controlled-rate freezer to prevent [[osmosis|osmotic]] cellular injury during ice crystal formation. HSC may be stored for years in a ''cryofreezer,'' which typically uses [[liquid nitrogen]].\n\n{{anchor|conditioning}}\n\n==Conditioning regimens==\n\n===Myeloablative===\nThe [[chemotherapy]] or [[irradiation]] given immediately prior to a transplant is called the ''conditioning regimen'', the purpose of which is to help eradicate the patient's disease prior to the infusion of HSC and to suppress immune reactions. The bone marrow can be ''ablated'' (destroyed) with dose-levels that cause minimal injury to other tissues. In allogeneic transplants a combination of [[cyclophosphamide]] with [[total body irradiation]] is conventionally employed. This treatment also has an [[immunosuppressive]] effect that prevents rejection of the HSC by the recipient's [[immune system]]. The post-transplant prognosis often includes acute and chronic [[graft-versus-host disease]] that may be life-threatening. However, in certain leukemias this can coincide with protection against cancer relapse owing to the [[graft-versus-tumor effect]].<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Toze CL, Galal A, Barnett MJ, et al |title=Myeloablative allografting for chronic lymphocytic leukemia: evidence for a potent graft-versus-leukemia effect associated with graft-versus-host disease |journal=[[Bone Marrow Transplant.]] |volume=36 |issue=9 |pages=825\u201330 |year=2005 |pmid=16151430 |doi=10.1038/sj.bmt.1705130|doi-access=free }}</ref> ''Autologous'' transplants may also use similar conditioning regimens, but many other chemotherapy combinations can be used depending on the type of disease.\n\n===Non-myeloablative===\nA newer treatment approach, non-myeloablative allogeneic transplantation, also termed reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC), uses doses of [[chemotherapy]] and [[radiation]] too low to eradicate all the [[bone marrow cells]] of the recipient.<ref name=\"Williams_2010_8\">{{Cite book | last=Kaushansky | first=K |author2=Lichtman, M |author3=Beutler, E |author4=Kipps, T |author5=Prchal, J |author6= Seligsohn, U. |title=Williams Hematology | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year=2010 | chapter= |edition=8th |isbn= 978-0071621519}}</ref>{{rp|320\u201321}} Instead, non-myeloablative transplants run lower risks of serious infections and transplant-related mortality while relying upon the ''graft versus tumor'' effect to resist the inherent increased risk of cancer relapse.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Alyea EP, Kim HT, Ho V, etal |title=Impact of conditioning regimen intensity on outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for advanced acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome |journal=Biol.

The offspring of donor-derived [[hematopoietic stem cell]]s have been documented to populate many different organs of the recipient, including the [[heart]], [[liver]], and [[muscle]], and these cells had been suggested to have the abilities of regenerating injured tissue in these organs.  However, recent research has shown that such lineage infidelity does not occur as a normal phenomenon {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}.\n\n[[Chimera (genetics)|Chimerism]] monitoring is a method to monitor the balance between the patient's own stem cells and the new stem cells from a donor. In case the patient's own stem cells are increasing in number post-treatment, this might be a sign the treatment did not work as intended.\n\n==Complications==\nHSCT is associated with a high treatment-related [[Mortality rate|mortality]] in the recipient, which limits its use to conditions that are themselves life-threatening. (The one-year survival rate has been estimated to be roughly 60%, although this figure includes deaths from the underlying disease as well as from the transplant procedure.)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mskcc.org/blog/msk-s-one-year-survival-rate-after-allogeneic-bone-marrow-transplant-exceeds-expectations|title=MSK's One-Year Survival Rate after Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplant Exceeds Expectations - Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center|date=2012|website=www.mskcc.org|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013200722/https://www.mskcc.org/blog/msk-s-one-year-survival-rate-after-allogeneic-bone-marrow-transplant-exceeds-expectations|archivedate=13 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Major complications include [[veno-occlusive disease]], [[mucositis]], infections ([[sepsis]]), [[graft-versus-host disease]], and the development of new [[cancer|malignancies]].\n\n===Infection===\nBone marrow transplantation usually requires that the recipient's own bone marrow be destroyed (myeloablation). Prior to the administration of new cells (engraftment), patients may go for several weeks without appreciable numbers of [[white blood cells]] to help fight [[infection]]. This puts a patient at high risk of infections, [[sepsis]] and [[septic shock]], despite [[prophylactic]] [[antibiotic]]s. However, [[Antiviral drug|antiviral]] [[medication]]s, such as [[acyclovir]] and [[valacyclovir]], are quite effective in prevention of HSCT-related outbreak of [[herpes simplex|herpetic]] infection in [[Serostatus|seropositive]] patients.<ref name=\"HSV\">{{cite journal  |vauthors=Elad S, Zadik Y, Hewson I, etal |title=A systematic review of viral infections associated with oral involvement in cancer patients: a spotlight on Herpesviridea |journal=Support Care Cancer |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=993\u20131006 |date=August 2010 |pmid=20544224 |doi=10.1007/s00520-010-0900-3}}</ref> The [[immunosuppressive agents]] employed in allogeneic transplants for the prevention or treatment of graft-versus-host disease further increase the risk of [[opportunistic infection]]. Immunosuppressive drugs are given for a minimum of 6-months after a transplantation, or much longer if required for the treatment of graft-versus-host disease. Transplant patients lose their [[immune system|acquired immunity]], for example immunity to childhood diseases such as [[measles]] or [[poliomyelitis|polio]]. For this reason transplant patients must be re-vaccinated with childhood [[vaccines]] once they are off immunosuppressive medications.\n\n===Veno-occlusive disease===\nSevere liver injury can result from hepatic [[veno-occlusive disease]] (VOD), newly termed sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://livertox.nih.gov/Phenotypes_sinus.html|title=Sinusoidal Obstruction|website=livertox.nih.gov|access-date=2019-07-30}}</ref> Elevated levels of [[bilirubin]], [[hepatomegaly]], and fluid retention are clinical hallmarks of this condition. There is now a greater appreciation of the generalized cellular injury and obstruction in [[Hepatic veins|hepatic vein]] sinuses. Severe cases of SOS are associated with a high mortality rate. [[Anticoagulant]]s or [[defibrotide]] may be effective in reducing the severity of VOD but may also increase bleeding complications. [[Ursodiol]] has been shown to help prevent VOD, presumably by facilitating the flow of [[bile]].\n\n===Mucositis===\nThe injury of the mucosal lining of the mouth and throat is a common regimen-related toxicity following ablative HSCT regimens. It is usually not life-threatening but is very painful, and prevents eating and drinking. Mucositis is treated with pain medications plus intravenous infusions to prevent dehydration and malnutrition.\n\n===Hemorrhagic cystitis===\nThe mucosal lining of the bladder could also be involved in approximately 5 percent of the children undergoing HSCT. This causes [[hematuria]] (blood in urine), frequent urination, abdominal pain, and [[thrombocytopenia]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hamidieh |first=A.

It is an attack by the \"new\" bone marrow's immune cells against the recipient's tissues. This can occur even if the donor and recipient are HLA-identical because the immune system can still recognize other differences between their tissues. It is aptly named graft-versus-host disease because bone marrow transplantation is the only transplant procedure in which the transplanted cells must accept the body rather than the body accepting the new cells.<ref name=\"HSCT3\">{{cite journal|last1=Shizuru|first1=JA|last2=Jerabek|first2=L|last3=Edwards|first3=CT|last4=Weissman|first4=IL|title=Transplantation of purified hematopoietic stem cells: requirements for overcoming the barriers of allogeneic engraftment|journal=Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation |date=February 1996|volume=2|issue=1|pages=3\u201314|pmid=9078349}}</ref>\n\n''Acute graft-versus-host disease'' typically occurs in the first 3 months after transplantation and may involve the [[skin]], [[intestine]], or the [[liver]]. High-dose [[corticosteroids]], such as [[prednisone]], are a standard treatment; however this immunosuppressive treatment often leads to deadly infections. ''Chronic graft-versus-host disease'' may also develop after allogeneic transplant. It is the major source of late treatment-related complications, although it less often results in death. In addition to [[inflammation]], chronic graft-versus-host disease may lead to the development of [[fibrosis]], or scar tissue, similar to [[scleroderma]]; it may cause functional disability and require prolonged immunosuppressive therapy.\nGraft-versus-host disease is usually mediated by [[T cell]]s, which react to foreign peptides presented on the [[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC]] of the host.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n===Graft-versus-tumor effect===\n{{Main|Graft-versus-tumor effect}}\n[[Graft-versus-tumor effect]] (GVT) or \"graft versus leukemia\" effect is the beneficial aspect of the graft-versus-host phenomenon.

GVT is the major benefit of transplants that do not employ the highest immunosuppressive regimens.\n\nGraft versus tumor is mainly beneficial in diseases with slow progress, e.g. chronic leukemia, low-grade lymphoma, and in some cases multiple myeloma.

The patient is then treated with high-dose [[chemotherapy]] with or without [[radiotherapy]] with the intention of eradicating the patient's malignant cell population at the cost of partial or complete [[bone marrow]] ablation (destruction of patient's bone marrow's ability to grow new blood cells).  The patient's own stored stem cells are then transfused into his/her bloodstream, where they replace destroyed tissue and resume the patient's normal blood cell production. Autologous transplants have the advantage of lower risk of infection during the immune-compromised portion of the treatment since the recovery of immune function is rapid. Also, the incidence of patients experiencing rejection is very rare (and [[graft-versus-host disease]] impossible) due to the donor and recipient being the same individual. These advantages have established autologous HSCT as one of the standard second-line treatments for such diseases as [[lymphoma]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Canellos, George |title=Lymphoma Update: 1997 |journal=The Oncologist |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=181\u201383 |year=1997}}</ref>\n\nHowever, for other cancers such as [[acute myeloid leukemia]], the reduced mortality of the autogenous relative to allogeneic HSCT may be outweighed by an increased likelihood of cancer relapse and related mortality, and therefore the allogeneic treatment may be preferred for those conditions.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Bruno B, Rotta M, Patriarca F, et al. |title=A comparison of allografting with autografting for newly diagnosed myeloma |journal=N.

Allogeneic HSC donors must have a tissue ([[human leukocyte antigen]], HLA) type that matches the recipient. Matching is performed on the basis of variability at three or more [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] of the HLA gene, and a perfect match at these loci is preferred. Even if there is a good match at these critical [[Allele|alleles]], the recipient will require [[Immunosuppression|immunosuppressive]] medications to mitigate [[graft-versus-host disease]]. Allogeneic transplant donors may be ''related'' (usually a closely HLA matched sibling), ''syngeneic'' (a [[monozygotic]] or 'identical' twin of the patient \u2013 necessarily extremely rare since few patients have an identical twin, but offering a source of perfectly HLA matched stem cells) or ''unrelated'' (donor who is not related and found to have very close degree of HLA matching). Unrelated donors may be found through a registry of bone marrow donors, such as the [[National Marrow Donor Program]] in the U.S. People who would like to be tested for a specific family member or friend without joining any of the bone marrow registry data banks may contact a private HLA testing laboratory and be tested with a blood test or mouth swab to see if they are a potential match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bonemarrowtest.com/marrowdonoroptions.htm|title=Public registry or private donation? - Information - BoneMarrowTest.com - Private HLA Testing, Stem Cell Transplantation Resources|last=Kate|website=www.bonemarrowtest.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115175514/http://www.bonemarrowtest.com/marrowdonoroptions.htm|archivedate=15 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  A \"[[savior sibling]]\" may be intentionally selected by [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] in order to match a child both regarding HLA type and being free of any obvious inheritable disorder.

In general, mismatches of the Type-I genes (i.e. [[HLA-A]], [[HLA-B]], or [[HLA-C]]) increase the risk of graft rejection.  A mismatch of an HLA Type II gene (i.e. [[HLA-DR]], or [[HLA-DQB1]]) increases the risk of graft-versus-host disease.  In addition, a genetic mismatch as small as a single [[DNA]] [[base pair]] is significant so perfect matches require knowledge of the exact DNA sequence of these genes for both donor and recipient.  Leading transplant centers currently perform testing for all five of these HLA genes before declaring that a donor and recipient are HLA-identical.\n\n[[Race (classification of human beings)|Race]] and [[ethnicity]] are known to play a major role in donor recruitment drives, as members of the same ethnic group are more likely to have matching genes, including the genes for HLA.<ref>[http://bethematch.org/transplant-basics/matching-patients-with-donors/why-race-and-ethnicity-matter/ \"Why race and ethnicity matter\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201154351/http://bethematch.org/transplant-basics/matching-patients-with-donors/why-race-and-ethnicity-matter/ |date=1 February 2014 }}.

About 25 to 30 percent of allogeneic HSCT recipients have an HLA-identical sibling. Even so-called \"perfect matches\" may have mismatched minor alleles that contribute to graft-versus-host disease.\n\n===Bone marrow===\n[[Image:Bone marrow biopsy.jpg|thumb|Bone marrow harvest.]]\nIn the case of a bone marrow transplant, the HSC are removed from a large bone of the donor, typically the [[pelvis]], through a large [[Hypodermic needle|needle]] that reaches the center of the bone. The technique is referred to as a bone marrow harvest and is performed under [[Local anesthesia|local]] or [[general anesthesia]].\n\n===Peripheral blood stem cells===\n{{Main|Peripheral stem cell transplantation}}\n[[File:Hematopoietic stem cell.jpg|thumb|Peripheral blood stem cells]]\nPeripheral blood stem cells<ref name=\"Cutler\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Cutler C, Antin JH |title=Peripheral blood stem cells for allogeneic transplantation: a review |journal=[[Stem Cells]] |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=108\u201317 |year=2001 |pmid=11239165 |doi=10.1634/stemcells.19-2-108}}</ref> are now the most common source of stem cells for HSCT. They are collected from the blood through a process known as [[apheresis]]. The donor's blood is withdrawn through a sterile needle in one arm and passed through a machine that removes [[white blood cells]]. The [[red blood cells]] are returned to the donor. The peripheral stem cell yield is boosted with daily [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous injections]] of [[granulocyte-colony stimulating factor]], serving to mobilize stem cells from the donor's bone marrow into the peripheral circulation.\n\n===Amniotic fluid===\nIt is also possible to extract stem cells from [[amniotic fluid]] for both [[Autotransplantation|autologous]] or [[Xenotransplantation|heterologous]] use at the time of childbirth.\n\n===Umbilical cord blood===\nUmbilical [[cord blood]] is obtained when a mother donates her infant's [[umbilical cord]] and [[placenta]] after birth. [[Cord blood]] has a higher concentration of HSC than is normally found in adult blood.  However, the small quantity of blood obtained from an umbilical cord (typically about 50 mL) makes it more suitable for transplantation into small children than into adults.  Newer techniques using ''ex vivo'' expansion of cord blood units or the use of two cord blood units from different donors allow cord blood transplants to be used in adults.\n\nCord blood can be harvested from the umbilical cord of a child being born after [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (PGD) for [[human leukocyte antigen]] (HLA) matching (see [[PGD for HLA matching]]) in order to donate to an ill sibling requiring HSCT.\n\n===Storage of HSC===\nUnlike other organs, bone marrow cells can be frozen ([[cryopreserved]]) for prolonged periods without damaging too many cells. This is a necessity with autologous HSC because the cells must be harvested from the recipient months in advance of the transplant treatment. In the case of [[Allogeneic|allogeneic transplants]], fresh HSC are preferred in order to avoid cell loss that might occur during the freezing and thawing process. Allogeneic [[cord blood]] is stored frozen at a [[cord blood bank]] because it is only obtainable at the time of [[childbirth]]. To cryopreserve HSC, a preservative, [[dimethyl sulfoxide]], must be added, and the cells must be cooled very slowly in a controlled-rate freezer to prevent [[osmosis|osmotic]] cellular injury during ice crystal formation. HSC may be stored for years in a ''cryofreezer,'' which typically uses [[liquid nitrogen]].\n\n{{anchor|conditioning}}\n\n==Conditioning regimens==\n\n===Myeloablative===\nThe [[chemotherapy]] or [[irradiation]] given immediately prior to a transplant is called the ''conditioning regimen'', the purpose of which is to help eradicate the patient's disease prior to the infusion of HSC and to suppress immune reactions. The bone marrow can be ''ablated'' (destroyed) with dose-levels that cause minimal injury to other tissues. In allogeneic transplants a combination of [[cyclophosphamide]] with [[total body irradiation]] is conventionally employed. This treatment also has an [[immunosuppressive]] effect that prevents rejection of the HSC by the recipient's [[immune system]]. The post-transplant prognosis often includes acute and chronic [[graft-versus-host disease]] that may be life-threatening.

It is an attack by the \"new\" bone marrow's immune cells against the recipient's tissues. This can occur even if the donor and recipient are HLA-identical because the immune system can still recognize other differences between their tissues.

''Chronic graft-versus-host disease'' may also develop after allogeneic transplant. It is the major source of late treatment-related complications, although it less often results in death. In addition to [[inflammation]], chronic graft-versus-host disease may lead to the development of [[fibrosis]], or scar tissue, similar to [[scleroderma]]; it may cause functional disability and require prolonged immunosuppressive therapy.\nGraft-versus-host disease is usually mediated by [[T cell]]s, which react to foreign peptides presented on the [[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC]] of the host.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n===Graft-versus-tumor effect===\n{{Main|Graft-versus-tumor effect}}\n[[Graft-versus-tumor effect]] (GVT) or \"graft versus leukemia\" effect is the beneficial aspect of the graft-versus-host phenomenon.

A further 561,000 cord blood units had been received by one of 46 cord blood banks from 30 countries participating.  The highest total number of bone marrow donors registered were those from the U.S. (8.0 million), and the highest number per capita were those from Cyprus (15.4 percent of the population).<ref name=\"BMDW2012\">[http://www.bmdw.org/uploads/media/BMDW2012.pdf Bone Marrow Donors Worldwide Annual Report 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220101951/http://www.bmdw.org/uploads/media/BMDW2012.pdf |date=20 December 2013 }}</ref>\n\nWithin the U.S., racial minority groups are the least likely to be registered and therefore the least likely to find a potentially life-saving match.
