The group was founded in 2004 and has been one of the groups responsible for the rise of [[collegiate a cappella]] in Scotland.\n\nThe group uploads their musical [[parody]] videos, to [[YouTube]], including \"Royal Romance\", a tribute to the [[wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton]] based upon [[Lady Gaga]]'s \"[[Bad Romance]]\", and their follow-up video \"St Andrews Girls\", a cover of [[Katy Perry]]'s \"[[California Gurls]]\", which was released in conjunction with a charity single raising money for [[Breast Cancer Care]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/user/thetheotherguys The Other Guys' Official YouTube Channel]</ref>. More recent parodies include charity single ''It's Raining Men'' (2014) and ''24K Meghan'' (2018). The group competes nationally and has travelled internationally on several tours.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== 2004-08: Formation and early years ===\n\nThe group was founded in 2004 by a group of friends who wanted to bring the American tradition of collegiate a cappella to the university. In the spring of 2005, the newly founded group went on its first international tour to the [[United States]] singing in [[New York City]] for the University Glee Club of New York City and in Westport, Connecticut at the Java Jam - a concert of American Collegiate A Cappella Groups at Greens Farms Academy.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} After three years spent increasing their reputation in both [[St. Andrews]] and Scotland, they released their debut album, ''Indecent Exposure'' in May 2007, which included covers of tracks by [[Seal (musician)|Seal]], [[Backstreet Boys]] and [[Chris DeBurgh]].\n\nIn the winter of 2007, St Andrews hosted the quarter-finals of the [[International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella]] (ICCAs) for the first time. The Other Guys went on to win this regional round and progressed to the Western European Final in London.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nOn 12 May 2008, the group released their second studio album ''The Damage is Done'', which included a [[mashup (music)|mash-up]] of two [[Scouting For Girls]] tracks, \"[[Elvis Ain't Dead]]\" and \"[[She's So Lovely]]\", and a rewritten version of \"[[Gangsta's Paradise]]\" which was renamed \"Golfer's Paradise\", referring to the status of St. Andrews as the 'Home of [[Golf]]'. A rewritten version of the latter is also present on their fourth album, ''Barely Regal''.\n\nThe Other Guys won the ICCA quarter-final again in 2008, where David Borowsky was awarded 'Outstanding Vocal Percussionist' at both the St Andrews quarter-final and the resulting Western European Final.<ref>[http://varsityvocals.com/results/icca-western-europe-region/?my_year=2008 ICCA Results 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426111206/http://varsityvocals.com/results/icca-western-europe-region/?my_year=2008 |date=26 April 2014 }} Retrieved 1 May 2014</ref>\n\n=== 2009\u201310 ===\n\nFollowing the formation of [[The Voice Festival UK]] (VF-UK) in 2009, The Other Guys proceeded to compete in one of the three semi-finals on 7 March 2009 in St. Andrews.

The group was founded in 2004 and has been one of the groups responsible for the rise of [[collegiate a cappella]] in Scotland.\n\nThe group uploads their musical [[parody]] videos, to [[YouTube]], including \"Royal Romance\", a tribute to the [[wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton]] based upon [[Lady Gaga]]'s \"[[Bad Romance]]\", and their follow-up video \"St Andrews Girls\", a cover of [[Katy Perry]]'s \"[[California Gurls]]\", which was released in conjunction with a charity single raising money for [[Breast Cancer Care]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/user/thetheotherguys The Other Guys' Official YouTube Channel]</ref>.

A rewritten version of the latter is also present on their fourth album, ''Barely Regal''.\n\nThe Other Guys won the ICCA quarter-final again in 2008, where David Borowsky was awarded 'Outstanding Vocal Percussionist' at both the St Andrews quarter-final and the resulting Western European Final.<ref>[http://varsityvocals.com/results/icca-western-europe-region/?my_year=2008 ICCA Results 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426111206/http://varsityvocals.com/results/icca-western-europe-region/?my_year=2008 |date=26 April 2014 }} Retrieved 1 May 2014</ref>\n\n=== 2009\u201310 ===\n\nFollowing the formation of [[The Voice Festival UK]] (VF-UK) in 2009, The Other Guys proceeded to compete in one of the three semi-finals on 7 March 2009 in St. Andrews.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]] it is classed as [[Afromontane]] forest, but with lowland and Guineo-Congolian elements. It is situated on two hill tops on [[dolerite]]-derived soils, and M\u00fcller (1991) proposed that these soil types determine its extent.<ref name=tim/> Goldsmith (1876) however suggested that it is only a relic of a once much larger forest which has been reduced by gradual climatic changes in a few hundred years.\n\nYear-round moisture, in the form of rain, mist or dew, provides for a substantial and intact moist leaf litter layer, on which its ecological processes depend. Decomposition is fungal, and not by termites or similar insects as would be the case in drier woodlands of the region.<ref name=tim/> Several tree species bear fleshy fruit, resulting in a good representation of mammal and bird [[frugivore]]s,<ref name=tim/> which impact both negatively and positively on seed dispersal. Much of the fauna shows affinities to forests elsewhere, particularly those at lower altitudes along the [[Southern Zanzibar-Inhambane coastal forest mosaic|East Africa coastal plains]].<ref name=tim/>\n\n==Protection==\nProtection from fires is expected to facilitate the regeneration and expansion of the forest. During his time of residence, Swynnerton noted that recurring fires had been gradually reducing outlying forest patches. Destruction of portions of the Chipete and Chipungambira satellite forest patches occurred during the 1860s.<ref name=spin/> It may have been aided by elephants which opened up forest, but more likely resulted from indigenous people who regularly cleared land by fire in spring time.<ref name=spin>{{cite book |last1=Spinage |first1=Clive A. |title=African ecology: benchmarks and historical perspectives |date=2012 |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |isbn=3642228712 |page=295 |edition=1}}</ref> Fire-resistant [[Parinari curatellifolia|mobola plum]] and [[Uapaca kirkiana|mahobohobo]] trees are pioneer species in such areas.<ref name=spin/>\n\nMaupare (1993) however noted that the forest boundary was stable and that former logging operations in the northern section had no lasting effect on the plant diversity.<ref name=spin/> This extraction of [[Khaya anthotheca|red mahogany]], [[Craibia brevicaudata|peawood]] and [[Tannodia swynnertonii|tannodia]] during the 1940s also had little effect on its extent.<ref name=tim/>\n\n==Flora and fauna==\n[[File:Dracaena fragrans, Chirinda Forest, Bart Wursten.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Dracaena fragrans|Forest dracaena]] in the understorey of the forest]]\nThe area is home to a high diversity of plants,<ref name=hyd>{{cite web |last1=Hyde |first1=M.A. |title=Plant records: Chirinda Forest |url=http://www.zimbabweflora.co.zw/speciesdata/utilities/utility-location-query.php?location_id=6 |website=Flora of Zimbabwe |accessdate=5 December 2014|display-authors=etal}}</ref> fungi, birds, butterflies, insects and reptiles.\n\n===Flora===\nRare tree species which seldom occur elsewhere in Zimbabwe include the [[Chrysophyllum gorungosanum|fluted milkwood]] (dominant canopy species), [[Ficus chirindensis|Chirinda fig]], [[Argomuellera macrophylla|undershrub big-leaf]], [[Celtis mildbraedii|Chirinda stinkwood]], [[Strychnos mitis|yellow bitterberry]] and [[Strychnos mellodora|forest strychnos]].<ref name=flz/> The type of the latter species was obtained in the forest by Swynnerton.<ref name=zam>{{cite web|last1=Leeuwenberg |first1=A.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]] it is classed as [[Afromontane]] forest, but with lowland and Guineo-Congolian elements. It is situated on two hill tops on [[dolerite]]-derived soils, and M\u00fcller (1991) proposed that these soil types determine its extent.<ref name=tim/> Goldsmith (1876) however suggested that it is only a relic of a once much larger forest which has been reduced by gradual climatic changes in a few hundred years.\n\nYear-round moisture, in the form of rain, mist or dew, provides for a substantial and intact moist leaf litter layer, on which its ecological processes depend. Decomposition is fungal, and not by termites or similar insects as would be the case in drier woodlands of the region.<ref name=tim/> Several tree species bear fleshy fruit, resulting in a good representation of mammal and bird [[frugivore]]s,<ref name=tim/> which impact both negatively and positively on seed dispersal. Much of the fauna shows affinities to forests elsewhere, particularly those at lower altitudes along the [[Southern Zanzibar-Inhambane coastal forest mosaic|East Africa coastal plains]].<ref name=tim/>\n\n==Protection==\nProtection from fires is expected to facilitate the regeneration and expansion of the forest. During his time of residence, Swynnerton noted that recurring fires had been gradually reducing outlying forest patches. Destruction of portions of the Chipete and Chipungambira satellite forest patches occurred during the 1860s.<ref name=spin/> It may have been aided by elephants which opened up forest, but more likely resulted from indigenous people who regularly cleared land by fire in spring time.<ref name=spin>{{cite book |last1=Spinage |first1=Clive A. |title=African ecology: benchmarks and historical perspectives |date=2012 |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |isbn=3642228712 |page=295 |edition=1}}</ref> Fire-resistant [[Parinari curatellifolia|mobola plum]] and [[Uapaca kirkiana|mahobohobo]] trees are pioneer species in such areas.<ref name=spin/>\n\nMaupare (1993) however noted that the forest boundary was stable and that former logging operations in the northern section had no lasting effect on the plant diversity.<ref name=spin/> This extraction of [[Khaya anthotheca|red mahogany]], [[Craibia brevicaudata|peawood]] and [[Tannodia swynnertonii|tannodia]] during the 1940s also had little effect on its extent.<ref name=tim/>\n\n==Flora and fauna==\n[[File:Dracaena fragrans, Chirinda Forest, Bart Wursten.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Dracaena fragrans|Forest dracaena]] in the understorey of the forest]]\nThe area is home to a high diversity of plants,<ref name=hyd>{{cite web |last1=Hyde |first1=M.A. |title=Plant records: Chirinda Forest |url=http://www.zimbabweflora.co.zw/speciesdata/utilities/utility-location-query.php?location_id=6 |website=Flora of Zimbabwe |accessdate=5 December 2014|display-authors=etal}}</ref> fungi, birds, butterflies, insects and reptiles.\n\n===Flora===\nRare tree species which seldom occur elsewhere in Zimbabwe include the [[Chrysophyllum gorungosanum|fluted milkwood]] (dominant canopy species), [[Ficus chirindensis|Chirinda fig]], [[Argomuellera macrophylla|undershrub big-leaf]], [[Celtis mildbraedii|Chirinda stinkwood]], [[Strychnos mitis|yellow bitterberry]] and [[Strychnos mellodora|forest strychnos]].<ref name=flz/> The type of the latter species was obtained in the forest by Swynnerton.<ref name=zam>{{cite web|last1=Leeuwenberg |first1=A.

Also that year Dunlop and Kelly joined Mother Earth, a jazz-rock group, which had [[Harry Brus]] on bass guitar, [[Ren\u00e9e Geyer]] as lead singer (ex-[[Sun 1972|Sun]]) and Mark Punch on guitar and vocals (ex-Nine Stage Horizon).<ref name=\"Sheil\"/><ref name=\"McFarlane RG\"/> In 1973 [[Rory O'Donoghue]] (of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's TV comedy series, ''[[The Aunty Jack Show]]'') on lead guitar and lead vocals formed a band, Cool Bananas, which Dunlop joined alongside Stein Bottington on bass guitar, Wayne Findlay on keyboards and Don Reid on flute and saxophone.<ref name=\"McFarlane GBRD\"/><ref name=\"Milesago CB AJ&tG\"/> Cool Bananas issued a single, \"Been and Gone\", in October. They followed with a novelty hit single, \"[[Farewell Aunty Jack]]\" (December 1973), which peaked at No.&nbsp;1 for three weeks in the following year.<ref name=\"Kent\"/><ref name=\"McFarlane GBRD\"/><ref name=\"McFarlane JRB\"/>\n\nIn February 1974 Dunlop and Punch founded the Johnny Rocco Band as a jazz-funk group, with Tony Buchanan on saxophone (ex-Thunderbirds, [[Daly-Wilson Big Band]]) and Tim Partridge on bass guitar (ex-Clockwork Oringe, King Harvest, Island, Mighty Kong).<ref name=\"McFarlane JRB\"/> McFarlane declared that they were \"one of the first Australian bands to incorporate funk and soul into the pub-rock forum\".<ref name=\"McFarlane JRB\"/> A fire at a night club destroyed the group's instruments and equipment three months later, however they continued to perform.<ref name=\"McFarlane JRB\"/> They backed [[Grahame Bond]] (\"Aunty Jack\", from the show of that name) and O'Donoghue, on a national tour as Aunty Jack and the Gong.<ref name=\"Milesago CB AJ&tG\"/><ref name=\"McFarlane JRB\"/>\n\nBy late 1974 Johnny Rocco Band had added Dunlop's former bandmate, Kenny, and a new associate, [[Leo de Castro]] on lead vocals (ex-King Harvest, Flite, Friends, De Castro). The group issued a single, \"Heading in the Right Direction\", in August 1975 and followed with their sole album, ''Rocco'', in the following year.<ref name=\"McFarlane JRB\"/> Punch had left the group just after the single's appearance, to join Geyer's backing band for her solo career \u2013 Geyer released a cover version of \"Heading in the Right Direction\" in 1976.<ref name=\"McFarlane RG\"/><ref name=\"McFarlane JRB\"/> For ''Rocco'' Dunlop provided drums and vibraphone as well as producing the recording, he co-mixed it with Bruce C. Brown.<ref name=\"Rocco\"/><ref name=\"Catterall\"/>\n\nIn January 1976 Tony Catterall of ''[[The Canberra Times]]'' compared ''Rocco'' with [[Felix Cavaliere]]'s second album, ''Destiny'' (1975).<ref name=\"Catterall\"/> He found that there were \"points of contact, apart from them both being soul, in the lyrics ... and the vocals\" and that Dunlop's \"production work is generally good, and he's roped in a solid list of session-men to add to the already highly talented band, Cavaliere shades him by a good deal.\"<ref name=\"Catterall\"/> He summarised his opinion \"The Johnny Rocco Band, and Dunlop in particular, could improve their already solid work by learning some lessons from Cavaliere. But the converse is true, too.\"<ref name=\"Catterall\"/>\n\nIn May 1976 Dunlop left Johnny Rocco Band and replaced [[Mark Kennedy (musician)|Mark Kennedy]] on drums in the jazz-rock fusion band, [[Ayers Rock (band)|Ayers Rock]], which toured the US from May to July and included his previous bandmate, Doyle, as a member.<ref name=\"McFarlane AR\"/> He left that group before the end of the year.<ref name=\"McFarlane AR\"/> Dunlop and Doyle subsequently toured Australia in the Aussie Blue Flames, backing the British performer, [[Georgie Fame]]. Dunlop also recorded and toured with other acts, while becoming more involved in record engineering and producing.<ref name=\"Sheil\"/> From the late 1970s, Dunlop and Brown began to collaborate at [[Albert Studios]], where Brown had started as an audio engineer in 1974, the duo also formed their own independent production company, BAD (Brown and Dunlop).<ref name=\"Abrahams\"/>\n\nDunlop's credits as producer or co-producer (with Brown) include Machinations' ''Esteem'', [[Mental As Anything]]'s ''Cats and Dogs'' and ''[[Creatures of Leisure]]'', [[Jon English]]'s ''[[Words Are Not Enough (album)|Words Are Not Enough]]'' and [[Doug Ashdown]]'s single, \"Winter in America\"<!-- Not the US album by Gil Scott-Heron and Brian Jackson-->.<ref name=\"Cashmere\"/> As well as working with local acts, Dunlop and Brown recorded as Player One for the 1979 novelty single, \"[[Space Invaders (Player One song)|Space Invaders]]\", which was inspired by the [[Space Invaders|arcade video game of the same name]], for [[Warner Bros. Records]].<ref name=\"Sheil\"/><ref name=\"Space\"/> It peaked at No.&nbsp;3 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart and was followed by the related album, ''Game Over'', in the next year.<ref name=\"Kent\"/>\n\nDunlop continued to play in live bands but session work gradually dried up during the 1990s, especially for drummers, as computerised rhythm machines increasingly replaced live musicians for recording. He worked as a radio operator for a courier company for a decade, before moving with his family to [[Lismore, New South Wales|Lismore]] in 2007, where he set up a small studio, and more recently he worked as an ensemble coach at [[Southern Cross University]]. One of his last music projects was producing and mixing the soundtrack for the [[Rachel Ward]] movie ''[[Beautiful Kate]]'', which had its world premiere at the [[Sydney Film Festival]] in June 2009.<ref name=\"Sheil\"/>\n\nDunlop died on 16 May 2009 \u2013 he had collapsed after playing a drum set at his son's wedding in Sydney.<ref name=\"Sheil\"/><ref name=\"Cashmere\"/> He is survived by his wife, Judi, his son, Aaron and his daughter, Kane.<ref name=\"Sheil\"/> Dunlop's funeral was held at the [[Northern Suburbs Crematorium, Sydney|Northern Suburbs Crematorium]] on 22 May.<ref name=\"APRA News\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n;General\n* {{Cite encyclopedia | last = McFarlane | first = Ian | authorlink = Ian McFarlane | encyclopedia = [[Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop]] | title = Whammo Homepage | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040405231007/http://www.whammo.com.au/index.asp | url = http://www.whammo.com.au/index.asp | archivedate = 5 April 2004 | accessdate = 11 November 2014 | year = 1999 | publisher = [[Allen & Unwin]] | location = [[St Leonards, New South Wales|St Leonards, NSW]] | isbn = 1-86508-072-1 }} Note: Archived [on-line] copy has limited functionality.\n;Specific\n{{Refend}}\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"APRA New\">{{cite web | publisher = [[Australasian Performing Right Association]] (APRA) | title = 'New Album Review' at APRA search engine | url = https://www.apra.com.au/cms/worksearch/worksearch.srvlt?action=workSearch#New%20Album%20Review | accessdate = 10 November 2014 }} Note: User may have to click 'Search again' and provide details at 'Enter a title:' e.g New Album Review*; or at 'Performer:' Russell Dunlop</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Sheil\">{{cite news |url = http://www.smh.com.au/national/obituaries/a-drummer-for-all-times-20090618-clxo.html | first = Pat | last = Sheil | title = A drummer for all times | work = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | date = 19 June 2009 | accessdate = 10 November 2014 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"McFarlane AF\">McFarlane, [https://web.archive.org/web/20040803080431/http://www.whammo.com.au/encyclopedia.asp?articleid=15 'Aesop's Fables'] entry.

They followed with a novelty hit single, \"[[Farewell Aunty Jack]]\" (December 1973), which peaked at No.&nbsp;1 for three weeks in the following year.<ref name=\"Kent\"/><ref name=\"McFarlane GBRD\"/><ref name=\"McFarlane JRB\"/>\n\nIn February 1974 Dunlop and Punch founded the Johnny Rocco Band as a jazz-funk group, with Tony Buchanan on saxophone (ex-Thunderbirds, [[Daly-Wilson Big Band]]) and Tim Partridge on bass guitar (ex-Clockwork Oringe, King Harvest, Island, Mighty Kong).<ref name=\"McFarlane JRB\"/> McFarlane declared that they were \"one of the first Australian bands to incorporate funk and soul into the pub-rock forum\".<ref name=\"McFarlane JRB\"/> A fire at a night club destroyed the group's instruments and equipment three months later, however they continued to perform.<ref name=\"McFarlane JRB\"/> They backed [[Grahame Bond]] (\"Aunty Jack\", from the show of that name) and O'Donoghue, on a national tour as Aunty Jack and the Gong.<ref name=\"Milesago CB AJ&tG\"/><ref name=\"McFarlane JRB\"/>\n\nBy late 1974 Johnny Rocco Band had added Dunlop's former band mate, Kenny, and a new associate, [[Leo de Castro]] on lead vocals (ex-King Harvest, Flite, Friends, De Castro). The group issued a single, \"Heading in the Right Direction\", in August 1975 and followed with their sole album, ''Rocco'', in the following year.<ref name=\"McFarlane JRB\"/> Punch had left the group just after the single's appearance, to join Geyer's backing band for her solo career \u2013 Geyer released a cover version of \"Heading in the Right Direction\" in 1976.<ref name=\"McFarlane RG\"/><ref name=\"McFarlane JRB\"/> For ''Rocco'' Dunlop provided drums and vibraphone as well as producing the recording, he co-mixed it with Bruce C. Brown.<ref name=\"Rocco\"/><ref name=\"Catterall\"/>\n\nIn January 1976 Tony Catterall of ''[[The Canberra Times]]'' compared ''Rocco'' with [[Felix Cavaliere]]'s second album, ''Destiny'' (1975).<ref name=\"Catterall\"/> He found that there were \"points of contact, apart from them both being soul, in the lyrics ... and the vocals\" and that Dunlop's \"production work is generally good, and he's roped in a solid list of session-men to add to the already highly talented band, Cavaliere shades him by a good deal.\"<ref name=\"Catterall\"/> He summarised his opinion \"The Johnny Rocco Band, and Dunlop in particular, could improve their already solid work by learning some lessons from Cavaliere. But the converse is true, too.\"<ref name=\"Catterall\"/>\n\nIn May 1976 Dunlop left Johnny Rocco Band and replaced [[Mark Kennedy (musician)|Mark Kennedy]] on drums in the jazz-rock fusion band, [[Ayers Rock (band)|Ayers Rock]], which toured the US from May to July and included his previous band mate, Doyle, as a member.<ref name=\"McFarlane AR\"/> He left that group before the end of the year.<ref name=\"McFarlane AR\"/> Dunlop and Doyle subsequently toured Australia in the Aussie Blue Flames, backing the British performer, [[Georgie Fame]]. Dunlop also recorded and toured with other acts, while becoming more involved in record engineering and producing.<ref name=\"Sheil\"/> From the late 1970s, Dunlop and Brown began to collaborate at [[Albert Studios]], where Brown had started as an audio engineer in 1974, the duo also formed their own independent production company, BAD (Brown and Dunlop).<ref name=\"Abrahams\"/>\n\nDunlop\u2019s credits as producer or co-producer (with Brown) include Machinations' ''Esteem'', [[Mental As Anything]]'s ''Cats and Dogs'' and ''[[Creatures of Leisure]]'', [[Jon English]]'s ''[[Words Are Not Enough (album)|Words Are Not Enough]]'' and [[Doug Ashdown]]'s single, \"Winter in America\"<!-- Not the US album by Gil Scott-Heron and Brian Jackson-->.<ref name=\"Cashmere\"/> As well as working with local acts, Dunlop and Brown recorded as Player One for the 1979 novelty single, \"[[Space Invaders (Player One song)|Space Invaders]]\", which was inspired by the [[Space Invaders|arcade video game of the same name]], for [[Warner Bros. Records]].<ref name=\"Sheil\"/><ref name=\"Space\"/> It peaked at No.&nbsp;3 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart and was followed by the related album, ''Game Over'', in the next year.<ref name=\"Kent\"/>\n\nDunlop continued to play in live bands but session work gradually dried up during the 1990s, especially for drummers, as computerised rhythm machines increasingly replaced live musicians for recording. He worked as a radio operator for a courier company for a decade, before moving with his family to [[Lismore, New South Wales|Lismore]] in 2007, where he set up a small studio, and more recently he worked as an ensemble coach at [[Southern Cross University]]. One of his last music projects was producing and mixing the soundtrack for the [[Rachel Ward]] movie ''[[Beautiful Kate]]'', which had its world premiere at the [[Sydney Film Festival]] in June 2009.<ref name=\"Sheil\"/>\n\nDunlop died on 16 May 2009 \u2013 he had collapsed after playing a drum set at his son's wedding in Sydney.<ref name=\"Sheil\"/><ref name=\"Cashmere\"/> He is survived by his wife, Judi, his son, Aaron and his daughter, Kane.<ref name=\"Sheil\"/> Dunlop's funeral was held at the [[Northern Suburbs Crematorium, Sydney|Northern Suburbs Crematorium]] on 22 May.<ref name=\"APRA News\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n;General\n* {{Cite encyclopedia | last = McFarlane | first = Ian | authorlink = Ian McFarlane | encyclopedia = [[Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop]] | title = Whammo Homepage | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040405231007/http://www.whammo.com.au/index.asp | url = http://www.whammo.com.au/index.asp | archivedate = 5 April 2004 | accessdate = 11 November 2014 | year = 1999 | publisher = [[Allen & Unwin]] | location = [[St Leonards, New South Wales|St Leonards, NSW]] | isbn = 1-86508-072-1 }} Note: Archived [on-line] copy has limited functionality.\n;Specific\n{{Refend}}\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"APRA New\">{{cite web | publisher = [[Australasian Performing Right Association]] (APRA) | title = 'New Album Review' at APRA search engine | url = https://www.apra.com.au/cms/worksearch/worksearch.srvlt?action=workSearch#New%20Album%20Review | accessdate = 10 November 2014 }} Note: User may have to click 'Search again' and provide details at 'Enter a title:' e.g New Album Review*; or at 'Performer:' Russell Dunlop</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Sheil\">{{cite news |url = http://www.smh.com.au/national/obituaries/a-drummer-for-all-times-20090618-clxo.html | first = Pat | last = Sheil | title = A drummer for all times | work = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | date = 19 June 2009 | accessdate = 10 November 2014 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"McFarlane AF\">McFarlane, [https://web.archive.org/web/20040803080431/http://www.whammo.com.au/encyclopedia.asp?articleid=15 'Aesop's Fables'] entry.
