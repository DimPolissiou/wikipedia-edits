In a letter to her followers sent to clarify her position on the Trinity, Gwen wrote: \"The reason all of this is important is that if you do not understand that God is the clear authority and that Jesus was under God's authority, then you will not have a clear picture of what it means to be Christ like. Jesus suffered, obeyed, submitted, denied his will, and made it his food to do the will of the Father.\" Later she writes, \"I believe that Jesus and God are two separate beings.\" She also says that she does not believe that Jesus and God are equal in power and glory.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/septemberweb-only/53.0a.html|title=The Weigh Is Narrow|last=Veenker|first=Jody|date=September 1, 2000|accessdate=2007-04-09|magazine=[[Christianity Today]]}}</ref>\n\n===Television, magazine and news media appearances===\nThe popularity of Gwen's teachings has resulted in its appearances on [[BBC]],<ref name=\"Weigh Down Media\">{{cite web |title= BBC Features Gwen Shamblin and Weigh Down |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhiXKYCi5tw |accessdate=29 April 2019}}</ref> [[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|''20/20'']],<ref name=\":9\" />, ''[[A Current Affair (U.S. TV series)|A Current Affair]],<ref name=\":7\" />'', ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'',<ref name=\"watchman Profile\">{{cite web |title=Profile: Weigh Down Workshop/ Remnant Fellowship |url=https://www.watchman.org/profiles/pdf/weighdownprofile.pdf |accessdate=29 April 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020141838/https://www.watchman.org/profiles/pdf/weighdownprofile.pdf |archivedate=October 20, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Germantown News\">{{cite news |title=Founder of Weigh Down Workshop to hold seminar at Great Hall |newspaper=Germantown News |date=April 6, 2011 |page=7B |quote=Gwen Shamblin and the Weigh Down Workshop was featured on such shows as 20/20, Larry King Live, and The View, as well as in such magazines as Good Housekeeping and Woman's Day}}</ref> and [[Dateline (Australian TV program)|''Dateline'']] (Australian)<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2001/03/28/week-dateline-slim-him|title=This week on Dateline: Slim for Him|work=News|access-date=2017-07-08|language=en}}</ref> as well as in such magazines as ''[[Family Circle]]'',<ref name=\":14\" /> ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a16666/lose-weight-inspiration-stories/|title=Lose the Weight for Good!|last=Torgovnick|first=Kate|date=2008-01-31|work=Good Housekeeping|access-date=2017-07-08|language=en}}</ref> ''[[Woman's Day]]'',<ref name=\":22\" /> and many newspaper articles.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":122\" /><ref name=\":132\" /> She has been featured on ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|The Today Show]]'',<ref name=\"Today Show\">{{cite web |title=The Today Show's Matt Lauer Interviews Gwen Shamblin Weigh Down Founder |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DD45ICXtwhk |accessdate=29 April 2019}}</ref> [[CNN]]'s ''[[Larry King Live]]'',''<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":9\" />'' ''[[DaySide]]'',<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/video2/launchPage.html?082306/082306_ds_faith&Faith-Based%20Diet%3F&DaySide&Can%20praying%20help%20you%20lose%20weight%3F&Health&-1&Faith-Based%20Diet%3F&Video%20Launch%20Page&News|title=Can Praying Help You Lose Weight?|date=2004-06-14|publisher=[[Fox News]]|accessdate=}}</ref> and ''[[The Early Show]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/earlyshow/main500202.shtml|title=The Early Show|publisher=[[CBS]]|accessdate=}}</ref> Participants from the Weigh Down Workshop have been featured on the cover of ''[[Good Housekeeping]]'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Slim-Down Secrets|last=Bollinger|first=Caroline|date=April 2007|work=Good House Keeping|access-date=|pages=158\u2013160}}</ref> in the ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Diet help from on high?|last=Cherry|first=Rona|date=January 2007|work=Ladies' Home Journal|access-date=}}</ref> in ''[[People (magazine)|People Magazine]]'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://people.com/archive/incredible-shrinking-couple-vol-69-no-1/|title=Incredible Shrinking Couple|last=Williams|first=Ashley|date=2008-01-14|work=People Magazine|access-date=2017-07-08|issue=1|volume=69|language=en-US}}</ref> ''First'' magazine,<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=I stopped thinking about food and the fat fell off!|last=|first=|date=2005-04-11|work=First Magazine|access-date=}}</ref> ''Quick and Simple'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=How I Prayed Off the Pounds|last=|first=|date=2007-05-29|work=Quick & Simple|access-date=|pages=8\u20139}}</ref> and in numerous newspaper articles.

On 13 July 2006, in a debate on the BBC's ''[[This Week (2003 TV programme)|This Week]]'', she argued that \"human life is not cheap to the Israelis, and human life on the other side is quite cheap actually, because they strap bombs to people and send them to blow themselves up.\" These comments were condemned by columnist [[Yasmin Alibhai-Brown]] who said \"Brutally straight, she sees no equivalence between the lives of the two tribes\".<ref>{{cite news |first=Yasmin |last=Alibhai-Brown |authorlink=Yasmin Alibhai-Brown |url=http://comment.independent.co.uk/columnists_a_l/yasmin_alibhai_brown/article1181666.ece |title=Nothing but anti-Arab racism can fully explain the behaviour of the Israelis |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719031841/http://comment.independent.co.uk/columnists_a_l/yasmin_alibhai_brown/article1181666.ece |archivedate=19 July 2006 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=17 July 2006 |accessdate=31 July 2006 }}</ref> Lipman responded to Alibhai-Brown's accusation of racism by arguing that the columnist had deliberately misrepresented Lipman's comments as generalisations about Muslims rather than specific comments about terrorists.<ref>{{cite web |first=Maureen |last=Lipman |url=http://comment.independent.co.uk/letters/article1185316.ece |title=Letters: It is wrong to call Israel a racist state |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=19 July 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720171816/http://comment.independent.co.uk/letters/article1185316.ece |archivedate=20 July 2006 |accessdate=5 September 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'', Lipman argued that media reporting of the conflict was \"heavily distorted\":\n{{cquote|There is rarely any film of rockets being fired into Israel, nor any mention of the damage, nor of the 250,000 refugees who have fled to the centre of Israel, nor of rockets targeting Israel every day since it withdrew from [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]], nor the damage done by 100 Hezbollah rockets a day...\n\nMore people are being killed in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Somalia]] and [[Darfur]] than in this conflict. Where is the coverage? It is as if the [[Iraq War]] has completely stopped while this blanket coverage in [[Lebanon]] goes on and on and on... I sometimes think Israel should ban the press as [[Zimbabwe]] has. They are a democracy, though, and behave accordingly...\n\nI respect freedom of speech, but I\u2019m contemptuous of the 300 signatories [to the anti-Invasion ''Times'' advert and the ''Independent'' letter]. To English, assimilated, sometimes self-despising Jews such as [[Gerald Kaufman]] and [[Harold Pinter]], I say: where are you going to go when the shit hits the fan? It doesn\u2019t matter if you stand in Parliament or marry into the aristocracy, there will be no Israel to receive you, as they have received so many before. Why didn\u2019t they put their ad in an Israeli newspaper? Because it is more important to impress their fellow Englishmen than to effect change in the situation.

The most common example is in the head of a tap ([[faucet]]) where the gland is usually packed with string which has been soaked in [[tallow]] or similar grease.  The gland nut allows the packing material to be compressed to form a watertight seal and prevent water leaking up the shaft when the tap is turned on. The gland at the rotating shaft of a [[centrifugal pump]] may be packed in a similar way and graphite grease used to accommodate continuous operation. The linear seal around the [[piston rod]] of a double acting steam piston is also known as a gland, particularly in marine applications. Likewise the shaft of a handpump or [[wind pump]] is sealed with a gland where the shaft exits the borehole.\n\nOther types of sealed connections without moving parts are also sometimes called glands; for example, a [[cable gland]] or fitting that connects a flexible electrical conduit to an enclosure, machine or bulkhead facilitates assembly and prevents liquid or gas ingress.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Boats===\n[[File:Small boat stuffing box.jpg|thumb|A small boat stuffing box comprising an adjusting nut, a locking nut and a sleeve]]\nOn a boat having an inboard motor that turns a shaft attached to an external [[propeller]], the shaft passes through a stuffing box, also called a \"packing box\"<ref>https://catalog.hydrasearchrecreational.com/category/packing-boxes-1</ref> or \"stern gland\" in this application. The stuffing box prevents sea water from entering the boat's hull. In many small [[fiberglass]] boats, for example, the stuffing box is mounted inboard near the point the shaft exits the [[hull (watercraft)|hull]]. The \"box\" is a cylindrical assembly, typically of bronze, comprising a sleeve threaded on one end to accept adjusting and locking nuts. A special purpose heavy-duty rubber hose attaches the stuffing box to a stern tube, also called a shaft log, that projects inward from the hull. Marine-duty [[hose clamp]]s secure the hose to the stern tube and the aft portion of the stuffing box sleeve. A sound stuffing box installation is critical to safety because failure can admit a catastrophic volume of water into the boat.\n\nIn a common type of stuffing box, rings of braided fiber, known as shaft packing or gland packing, form a seal between the shaft and the stuffing box. A traditional variety of shaft packing comprises a square cross-section rope made of [[flax]] or [[hemp]] impregnated with wax and lubricants. A turn of the adjusting nut compresses the shaft packing. Ideally, the compression is just enough to make the seal both watertight when the shaft is stationary and drip slightly when the shaft is turning. The drip rate must be at once sufficient to lubricate and cool the shaft and packing, but not so much as could sink an unattended boat.\n\nThere are improved shaft packing materials that aim to be drip-less when the shaft is turning as well as when stationary, also pack-less sealing systems that employ engineered materials such as carbon composites and [[PTFE]] (e.g. Teflon).\n\n===Steam engines===\n[[File:\"the valve rod comes out the stuffing box...\".jpg|thumb|A rod coming out of a stuffing box on a steam engine]]\nIn a [[steam engine]], where the piston rod reciprocates through the cylinder cover, a stuffing box provided in the cylinder cover prevents the leakage of steam from the cylinder.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Axlebox]]\n* [[Bilge]]\n* [[Compression seal fitting]]\n* [[Journal bearing]]\n* [[Journal box]]\n* [[Labyrinth seal]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Calder, Nigel (2005).
