In a wider sense, the term is used to refer to a variety of Spanish musical styles. The oldest record of flamenco music dates to 1774 in the book ''Las Cartas Marruecas'' by [[Jos\u00e9 Cadalso]] {{harv|Akombo|2016|loc=240\u2013241}}. Flamenco has been influenced by and associated with the [[Romani people in Spain]]; however, its origin and style are uniquely Andalusian {{harv|Hayes|2009|loc=31\u201337}}.\n\nManuel R\u00edos Ruiz notes that the development of flamenco is well documented: \"the theatre movement of [[Sainete|sainetes]] (one-act plays) and [[Tonadilla|tonadillas]], popular song books and song sheets, customs, studies of dances, and ''toques'', perfection, newspapers, graphic documents in paintings and engravings....in continuous evolution together with rhythm, the poetic stanzas, and the ambiance\" {{harv|R\u00edos Ruiz|1997|loc={{Page needed|date=October 2019}}}}.\n\nNevertheless, the exact origin of flamenco is unknown and the subject of many hypotheses. The most widespread is that flamenco was developed through the cross-cultural interchange between moriscos and gitanos ( Romani people of Spain) during the sixteenth century specifically in East Andalusia. {{harv|Machin-Autenrieth|2015|loc=29}};  (See Sources below). The ''[[Diccionario de la lengua espa\u00f1ola]]'' (Dictionary of the Spanish Language) primarily attributes the creation of the style directly to the [[Spanish Romani]] {{harv|Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola|2019|loc=sense 4}}.\n\nFlamenco has become popular all over the world, especially the [[United States]] and [[Japan]]. In Japan, there are more flamenco academies than there are in Spain {{harv|Mendoza|2011|loc=52}}. \"In El Salvador the group Alma Flamenca is considered the maximum representative and pioneer of this musical movement\" {{harv|Mendoza|2011|loc=52}}.\n\nOn November 16, 2010, [[UNESCO]] declared flamenco one of the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] {{harv|Anon.|2010}}.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThere are many suggestions for the origin of the word ''flamenco'' as a musical term, but no solid evidence for any of them. The word is Spanish for \"Flemish\" (meaning \"native of [[Flanders]]\", a one-time Spanish possession) {{harv|Harper|n.d.}}. The Spanish verb ''flamear'' means ''to flamb\u00e9''. The word was not recorded as a musical and dance term until the late 18th century, in the book ''Las Cartas Marruecas'' by [[Jos\u00e9 Cadalso]] (1774) {{harv|Akombo|2016|loc=240\u2013241}}.\n\nOne theory, proposed by Andalusian historian [[Blas Infante]], is that the word is derived from the Hispano-[[Arabic language|Arabic]] term ''[[Fellah|fellah mengu]]'', meaning \"expelled peasant\", referring to the Andalusians of [[Islamic]] faith and the remaining [[Moriscos]] who fled with the [[Romani people|Roma]] newcomers ({{harvnb|Infante|2010|loc=166}}; {{harvnb|Herrera|2006}}).\n\nAnother theory is that the Spanish word ''[[wikt:flamenco#Spanish|flamenco]]'' is a derivative of the Spanish word, meaning \"[[fire]]\" or \"flame\".  The word ''flamenco'' may have been used for fiery behaviour, which could have come to be applied to the [[Romani people in Spain|Gitano]] players and performers {{harv|Ruiz|2007|loc=165ff}}.\n\n== ''Palos'' ==\n{{Main|Palo (flamenco)}}\n[[File:Palos flamencos.jpg|thumb|The ''Palos'' of Flamenco]]\n''[[Palo (flamenco)|Palos]]'' (formerly known as ''cantes'') are flamenco styles, classified by criteria such as rhythmic pattern, [[Musical mode|mode]], [[chord progression]], [[stanza]]ic form and geographic origin. There are over 50 different ''palos'', some are sung unaccompanied while others have guitar or other accompaniment. Some forms are danced while others are not. Some are reserved for men and others for women while some may be performed by either, though these traditional distinctions are breaking down: the ''Farruca'', for example, once a male dance, is now commonly performed by women too.\n\nThere are many ways to categorize ''Palos'' but they traditionally fall into three classes: the most serious is known as ''[[cante jondo]]'' (or ''[[Cante flamenco#Cante Grande (also known as cante jondo)|cante grande]]''), while lighter, frivolous forms are called ''[[Cante Chico|cante chico]]''. Forms that do not fit either category are classed as ''[[Cante Intermedio|cante intermedio]]'' {{harv|Pohren|2005|loc=68}}. These are the best known ''palos'' ({{harvnb|Anon.|2019}}; {{harvnb|Anon.|2012}}):\n\n* [[Alegr\u00edas]]\n* [[Buler\u00edas]]\n* [[Sole\u00e1 por Buler\u00edas|Buler\u00edas por sole\u00e1 (sole\u00e1 por buler\u00edas)]]\n* Caracoles\n* [[Cartageneras]]\n* [[Fandango]]\n* Fandango de Huelva\n* Fandango Malague\u00f1o\n* [[Farruca]]\n* [[Grana\u00edna]]s\n* [[Guajiras (Flamenco)|Guajiras]]\n* [[Malague\u00f1as (flamenco style)|Malague\u00f1as]]\n* Martinete\n* Mineras\n* Nanas\n* [[Peteneras]]\n* Ronde\u00f1as\n* [[Saeta (flamenco)|Saeta]]\n* [[Siguiriyas|Seguiriyas]]\n* [[Sole\u00e1]]\n* [[Tango (flamenco)|Tangos]]\n* Tanguillos\n* Tarantos\n* [[Tientos (Flamenco)|Tientos]]\n* Villancicos\n\n== Music ==\n{{Quote|There are three fundamental elements which can help define whether or not something really is flameco: A flamenco mode -or musical tonality-; the ''comp\u00e1s'' -rhythm- and the performer...who should be a Flamenco! All three of these elements: tonality, ''comp\u00e1s'', a flamenco performer and then something less easily identifiable- ''Flamencura''- must be present together if we are to wend up with a piece of music which can be labelled 'flamenco'. By themselves, these elements won't turn a piece of music into flamenco.|{{harv|Martinez|2011|loc=6}}}}\n{{Quote|Three fundamental elements that help define whether or not a dance belongs to the Flamenco genre are the presence of a Flamenco mode (musical tonality), ''compas'', and a Flamenco performer (Martinez, 2003). These three elements contribute to the authenticity of a Flamenco performance also known as ''flamencura'' (Martinez, 2003). There is also no such thing as a passive audience during Flamenco performances {{bracket|[[participatory art|participatory music]]}}. The audience joins in the performance by clapping their hands and even sometimes singing along (Totton, 2003).|{{harv|Akombo|2016|loc=243}}}}\n\n=== Structure ===\nA typical flamenco recital with voice and guitar accompaniment comprises a series of pieces (not exactly \"songs\") in different palos. Each song is a set of verses (called ''copla'', ''tercio'', or ''letras''), punctuated by guitar interludes (''[[falseta]]s''). The guitarist also provides a short introduction setting the tonality, ''comp\u00e1s'' (see below) and tempo of the cante {{harv|Manuel|2006|loc=98}}. In some palos, these falsetas are played with a specific structure too; for example, the typical [[sevillanas]] is played in an AAB pattern, where A and B are the same falseta with only a slight difference in the ending {{harv|Martin|2002|loc=48}}.\n\n=== Harmony ===\nFlamenco uses the [[Flamenco mode]] (which can also be described as the [[Phrygian mode#Modern Phrygian mode|modern Phrygian mode]] (''modo frigio''), or a harmonic version of that scale with a major 3rd [[degree (music)|degree]]), in addition to the [[major scale|major]] and [[minor scale|minor]] scales commonly used in modern Western music. The Phrygian mode occurs in ''palos'' such as [[Soleares|sole\u00e1]], most [[buler\u00edas]], [[siguiriya]]s, [[tango (flamenco)|tangos]] and [[tientos]].\n[[File:E Phrygian Scale.PNG|frame|left|Descending E Phrygian scale in flamenco music, with common alterations in parentheses]]\n\nA typical [[chord sequence]], usually called the \"[[Andalusian cadence]]\" may be viewed as in a modified Phrygian: in E the sequence is '''Am\u2013G\u2013F\u2013E''' {{harv|Manuel|2006|loc=96}}. According to [[Manolo Sanl\u00facar]] '''E''' is here the [[tonic (music)|tonic]], '''F''' has the [[diatonic function|harmonic function]] of [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] while '''Am''' and '''G''' assume the functions of [[subdominant]] and [[mediant]] respectively {{harv|Torres Cort\u00e9s|2001}}.\n\nGuitarists tend to use only two basic inversions or \"chord shapes\" for the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] [[chord (music)]], the open 1st inversion '''E''' and the open 3rd inversion '''A''', though they often [[Transposition (music)|transpose]] these by using a [[capo]]. Modern guitarists such as [[Ram\u00f3n Montoya]], have introduced other positions: Montoya himself started to use other chords for the tonic in the [[Dorian mode|modern Dorian]] sections of several ''palos''; '''F{{music|sharp}}''' for ''[[Tarantella|tarantas]]'', '''B''' for ''[[grana\u00edna]]s'' and '''A{{music|flat}}''' for the ''minera''. Montoya also created a new ''palo'' as a solo for guitar, the ''[[ronde\u00f1a]]'' in '''C{{music|sharp}}''' with ''[[scordatura]]''. Later guitarists have further extended the repertoire of [[tonality|tonalities]], chord positions and ''scordatura''.\n\nThere are also ''palos'' in major mode; most [[canti\u00f1as]] and [[alegr\u00edas]], [[guajiras]], some ''[[buler\u00edas]]'' and ''[[ton\u00e1s]]'', and the ''cabales'' (a major type of ''[[siguiriyas]]''). The minor mode is restricted to the ''[[Farruca]]'', the ''milongas'' (among ''[[cantes de ida y vuelta]]''), and some styles of ''tangos, buler\u00edas'', etc. In general traditional palos in major and minor mode are limited harmonically to two-chord (tonic\u2013dominant) or three-chord (tonic\u2013subdominant\u2013dominant) progressions {{harv|Rossy|1998|loc=92}}. However modern guitarists have introduced [[chord substitution]], transition chords, and even [[modulation (music)|modulation]].\n\n''[[Fandangos]]'' and derivative ''palos'' such as ''[[Malague\u00f1as (flamenco style)|malague\u00f1as]]'', ''tarantas'' and ''[[cartageneras]] are bimodal'': guitar introductions are in Phrygian mode while the singing develops in major mode, modulating to Phrygian at the end of the stanza {{harv|Rossy|1998|loc=92}}.\n\n=== Melody ===\nDionisio Preciado, quoted by Sabas de {{harvtxt|Hoces|1982|loc={{Page needed|date=October 2019}}}}, established the following characteristics for the melodies of flamenco singing:\n\n#[[Microtonality]]: presence of [[interval (music)|intervals]] smaller than the [[semitone]].\n#[[Portamento]]: frequently, the change from one note to another is done in a smooth transition, rather than using discrete intervals.\n#Short [[tessitura]] or [[range (music)|range]]: Most traditional flamenco songs are limited to a range of a sixth (four tones and a half). The impression of vocal effort is the result of using different [[timbre]]s, and variety is accomplished by the use of microtones.\n#Use of [[enharmonic scale]]. While in [[equal temperament]] scales, [[enharmonic]]s are notes with identical pitch but different spellings (e.g. A\u266d and G\u266f); in flamenco, as in [[Equal temperament|unequal temperament]] scales, there is a microtonal intervalic difference between enharmonic notes.\n#Insistence on a note and its contiguous chromatic notes (also frequent in the guitar), producing a sense of urgency.\n#Baroque [[ornament (music)|ornamentation]], with an expressive, rather than merely aesthetic function.\n#Apparent lack of regular rhythm, especially in the [[siguiriyas]]: the melodic rhythm of the sung line is different from the metric rhythm of the accompaniment.\n#Most styles express sad and bitter feelings.\n#Melodic [[improvisation]]: flamenco singing is not, strictly speaking, improvised, but based on a relatively small number of traditional songs, singers add variations on the spur of the moment.\n\nMusicologist Hip\u00f3lito Rossy adds the following characteristics {{harv|Rossy|1998|loc=97}}:\n\n*Flamenco melodies are characterized by a descending tendency, as opposed to, for example, a typical opera [[aria]], they usually go from the higher pitches to the lower ones, and from [[Dynamics (music)|forte]] to [[Dynamics (music)|piano]], as was usual in ancient Greek scales.\n*In many styles, such as [[Soleares|sole\u00e1]] or [[siguiriya]], the melody tends to proceed in contiguous [[degree (music)|degrees]] of the scale. [[Steps and skips|Skips]] of a third or a fourth are rarer. However, in [[fandangos]] and fandango-derived styles, fourths and sixths can often be found, especially at the beginning of each line of verse. According to Rossy, this is proof of the more recent creation of this type of songs, influenced by Castilian [[jota (music)|jota]].\n\n=== Comp\u00e1s ===\n'''Comp\u00e1s''' is the Spanish word for [[metre (music)|metre]] or [[time signature]] (in classical [[music theory]]). It also refers to the rhythmic cycle, or layout, of a ''palo''.\n\nThe comp\u00e1s is fundamental to flamenco. Comp\u00e1s is most often translated as [[rhythm]] but it demands far more precise interpretation than any other Western style of music. If there is no guitarist available, the comp\u00e1s is rendered through hand clapping (''palmas'') or by hitting a table with the knuckles. The guitarist uses techniques like strumming (''rasgueado'') or tapping the [[sound board (music)|soundboard]] (''golpe''). Changes of chords emphasize the most important downbeats.\n\nFlamenco uses three basic counts or measures: Binary, Ternary and a form of a twelve-beat cycle that is unique to flamenco. There are also free-form styles including, among others, the [[ton\u00e1s]], [[Saeta (flamenco)|saetas]], [[Malague\u00f1as (flamenco style)|malague\u00f1as]], tarantos, and some types of [[fandangos]].\n\n*Rhythms in {{music|time|2|4}} or {{music|time|4|4}}. These metres are used in forms like [[tango (flamenco)|tangos]], [[tientos]], [[Flamenco Rumba|gypsy rumba]], [[zambra]] and tanguillos.\n*Rhythms in {{music|time|3|4}}. These are typical of [[fandangos]] and [[sevillanas]], suggesting their origin as non-Roma styles, since the {{music|time|3|4}} and {{music|time|4|4}} measures are not common in ethnic Roma music.\n*12-beat rhythms usually rendered in amalgams of {{music|time|6|8}} + {{music|time|3|4}} and sometimes {{music|time|12|8}}. The 12-beat cycle is the most common in flamenco, differentiated by the accentuation of the beats in different palos. The accents do not correspond to the classic concept of the downbeat. The alternating of groups of 2 and 3 beats is also common in Spanish folk dances of the 16th Century such as the ''zarabanda'', ''j\u00e1cara'' and ''canarios''.\n\nThere are three types of 12-beat rhythms, which vary in their layouts, or use of accentuations: sole\u00e1, seguiriya and buler\u00eda.\n\n#[[peteneras]] and [[guajiras]]: 1 2 '''3''' 4 5 '''6''' 7 '''8''' 9 '''10''' 11 '''12'''. Both palos start with the strong accent on 12. Hence the meter is  '''12''' 1 2 '''3''' 4 5 '''6''' 7 '''8''' 9 '''10''' 11...\n#The [[seguiriya]], liviana<!-- liviana links to a page about a genus of moths-->, [[Palo (flamenco)|serrana]], ton\u00e1 liviana, cabales: '''12'''1 '''2''' 3 '''4''' 5 6 '''7''' 8 9 '''10''' 11 '''12'''.\n#[[Soleares|sole\u00e1]], within the [[canti\u00f1as]] group of palos which includes the [[alegr\u00edas]], canti\u00f1as, mirabras, romera, caracoles and sole\u00e1 por buler\u00eda (also \"[[Buler\u00edas|buler\u00eda por sole\u00e1]]\"): 1 2 '''3''' 4 5 '''6''' 7 '''8''' 9 '''10''' 11 '''12'''. For practical reasons, when transferring flamenco guitar music to sheet music, this rhythm is written as a regular {{music|time|3|4}}.\n\nThe [[Buler\u00edas]] is the emblematic palo of flamenco: today its 12-beat cycle is most often played with accents on the 3rd, 6th, 8th, 10th and 12th beats. The accompanying ''palmas'' are played in groups of 6 beats, giving rise to a multitude of counter-rhythms and percussive voices within the 12 beat comp\u00e1s.  In certain regions like, Xerez, Spain, the rhythm stays in a simpler six-count rhythm, only including the twelve count in a musical resolve.{{Clarify|date=October 2019|reason=What is a \"musical resolve\"?}}\n\n[[File:Flamenco Compas.theora.ogv|thumb|400 px|none|Flamenco [[Buler\u00edas]] with emphasis as '''[12]''' 1 2 '''[3]''' 4 5 '''[6]''' 7 '''[8]''' 9 '''[10]''' 11 \u2013 also the rhythm for the song [[America (West Side Story song)|''America'' from the ''West Side Story'']]]]\n\n== Forms of flamenco expression ==\n\n=== Toque (guitar) ===\n\n{{Main|Flamenco guitar}}\n\n[[File:Paco de lucia 2007.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Paco de Luc\u00eda]], one of the most commercially successful exponents of flamenco {{harv|Koster|2002|loc=5}}]]\n\nThe origins, history and importance of the flamenco guitar is covered in the main Wikipedia entry for the [[Flamenco guitar]].\n\n=== Cante (song) ===\n{{Main|Cante flamenco}}\n\n[[File:Flamenco 001.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|Flamenco performance by the La Primavera group]]\n\nThe origins, history and importance of the cante is covered in the main Wikipedia entry for the [[cante flamenco]].\n\n=== Baile (dance) ===\n\n''El baile flamenco'' is known for its emotional intensity, proud carriage, expressive use of the arms and rhythmic stamping of the feet, unlike [[tap dance]] or [[Irish dance]] which use different techniques. As with any dance form, many different styles of flamenco have developed.\n\nIn the twentieth century, flamenco danced informally at gitano (Roma) celebrations in Spain was considered the most \"authentic\" form of flamenco. There was less virtuoso technique in gitano flamenco, but the music and steps are fundamentally the same. The arms are noticeably different from classical flamenco, curving around the head and body rather than extending, often with a bent elbow.\n[[File:Tablao Cordob\u00e9s 06.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Flamenco, C\u00f3rdoba]]\n\"Flamenco puro\" otherwise known as \u201cflamenco por derecho\u201d is considered the form of performance flamenco closest to its gitano influences. In this style, the dance is often performed solo, and is based on signals and calls of structural improvisation rather than choreographed. In the improvisational style, castanets are not often used. \n\n\"Classical flamenco\" is the style most frequently performed by Spanish flamenco dance companies. It is danced largely in a proud and upright style. For women, the back is often held in a marked back bend. Unlike the more gitano influenced styles, there is little movement of the hips, the body is tightly held and the arms are long, like a [[ballet]] dancer. In fact many of the dancers in these companies are trained in Ballet Cl\u00e1sico Espa\u00f1ol more than in the improvisational language of flamenco. Flamenco has both influenced and been influenced by Ballet Cl\u00e1sico Espa\u00f1ol, as evidenced by the fusion of the two ballets created by 'La Argentinita' in the early part of the twentieth century and later, by [[Joaqu\u00edn Cort\u00e9s]], eventually by the entire Ballet Nacional de Espa\u00f1a et al.\n\nIn the 1950s [[Jose Greco]] was one of the most famous male Flamenco dancers, performing on stage worldwide and on television including the [[Ed Sullivan Show]], and reviving the art almost singlehandedly.  Greco\u2019s company left a handful of prominent pioneers, most notably: Maria Benitez and Vicente Romero of New Mexico.  Today, there are many centers of Flamenco art.  Albuquerque, New Mexico is considered the \u201cCenter of the Nation\u201d for Flamenco Art. Much of this is due to Maria Benitez\u2019s 37 years of sold-out summer seasons. Albuquerque boasts three distinct prominent centers: National Institute of Flamenco, Casa Flamenca and Flamenco Works. Each center dedicates time to daily training, cultural diffusion and world-class performance equaled only to world-class performances one would find in the heart of Southern Spain, Andaluc\u00eda.\n\nModern flamenco is a highly technical dance style requiring years of study. The emphasis for both male and female performers is on lightning-fast footwork performed with absolute precision. In addition, the dancer may have to dance while using props such as castanets, canes, shawls and fans.\n\n\"[[New Flamenco|Flamenco nuevo]]\" is a recent marketing phenomenon in Flamenco. Marketed as a \u201cnewer version\u201d of Flamenco, its roots came from world-music promoters trying to sell albums of artists who created music that \u201csounded like\u201d or had Spanish-style influences.  Though some of this music was played in similar pitches, scales and was well-received, it has little to nothing to do with the Art of Flamenco guitar, dance, cante Jondo or the improvisational language.  \u201cNuevo Flamenco\u201d consists largely of compositions and repertoire, while Traditional Flamenco music and dance is a language composed of stanzas, actuated by oral formulaic calls and signals.\n\n[[File:Deborah Greenfield.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Los Angeles, United States]]\nThe flamenco most foreigners are familiar with is a style that was developed as a spectacle for tourists. To add variety, group dances are included and even solos are more likely to be choreographed. The frilly, voluminous spotted dresses are derived from a style of dress worn for the [[Sevillanas]] at the annual [[Seville Fair|Feria]] in [[Seville]].\n\nIn traditional flamenco, only the very young or older dancers are considered to have the emotional innocence or maturity to adequately convey the ''[[Duende (art)|duende]]'' (soul) of the genre {{harv|Anon.|n.d.}}. Therefore, unlike other dance forms, where dancers turn professional through techniques early on to take advantage of youth and strength, many flamenco dancers do not hit their peak until their thirties and will continue to perform into their fifties and beyond.  One artist that is considered a young master is Juan Manuel Fernandez Montoya, otherwise known as \u201cFarruquito.\u201d  At age 12, Farruquito was considered a pioneer and for \u201cFlamenco Puro,\u201d or \u201cFlamenco por Derecho,\u201d because of his emotional depth.  \n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Castelucho.jpg|[[Claudio Castelucho]], Flamenco\nFile:Theatre Flamenco Work Sample.webm|Theatre Flamenco Work Sample\nFile:Baile andaluz 1893 Jos\u00e9 Villegas Cordero.jpg|[[Jos\u00e9 Villegas Cordero]], Baile Andaluz\nFile:Sargent John Singer Spanish Dancer.jpg|[[John Singer Sargent]], Spanish Dancer\n</gallery>\n\n;Scenes of flamenco performance in Seville.\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFlamenco en el Palacio Andaluz, Sevilla, Espa\u00f1a, 2015-12-06, DD 07.JPG\nFlamenco en el Palacio Andaluz, Sevilla, Espa\u00f1a, 2015-12-06, DD 11.JPG\nFlamenco en el Palacio Andaluz, Sevilla, Espa\u00f1a, 2015-12-06, DD 20.JPG\nFlamenco en el Palacio Andaluz, Sevilla, Espa\u00f1a, 2015-12-06, DD 23.JPG\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Latin music|Music}}\n{{columns-list|\n*[[Andalusian Centre of Flamenco]] \u2013 an institution in Spain founded in 1993 to safeguard and promote the values and standards of flamenco\n*[[Concurso de Cante Jondo]] \u2013 (Contest of the Deep Song) was a fiesta of flamenco arts, music, song, and dance, held in [[Granada]] in 1922\n*[[Festival Bienal Flamenco]] \u2013 in theatres [[Seville]], this festival features flamenco puro to innovative new works by dancers, vocalists and guitarists\n*[[Flamenco rumba]] \u2013 a style of flamenco music\n*[[Flamenco rock]] \u2013 a rock music subgenre that emerged from Andalusia\n*[[Flamenco shoes]] \u2013 commonly leather shoes constructed with small nails embedded in the toe and heel to enhance the sound of the dancer's percussive footwork\n*[[Latin Grammy Award for Best Flamenco Album]]\n*''[[Kumpan\u00eda: Flamenco Los Angeles]]'' \u2013 a 2011 independent documentary film exploring the origins and contemporary Spanish culture of flamenco\n*[[New Flamenco]] \u2013 a derivative of traditional flamenco [[Fusion (music)|fusing]] flamenco guitar virtuosity with other musical styles\n*[[Camar\u00f3n de la Isla]] \u2013 considered one of the all-time greatest flamenco singers\n*[[Paco de Lucia]] \u2013 a Spanish virtuoso flamenco guitarist, composer, and record producer\n*[[David Pe\u00f1a Dorantes]] \u2013 a Romani flamenco pianist and composer from Andalusia\n*[[Ni\u00f1o Josele]] \u2013 a Spanish guitarist, and exponent of the New flamenco style\n*[[Paco Pe\u00f1a]] \u2013 regarded as one of the world's foremost traditional flamenco guitar players\n*[[Sevillanas]] \u2013 a type of folk music and dance of Seville and its region, influenced by flamenco\n*[[Silverio Franconetti]] \u2013 a singer and the leading figure of the period in flamenco history known as \"The Golden Age\"\n*[[Tablao]] \u2013 a place where flamenco shows are performed and the term used for the flamenco dance floor\n*[[Tomatito]] \u2013 a Spanish roma flamenco guitarist\n*[[Traje de flamenca]] \u2013 the dress traditionally worn by women at festivals in Andalusia; one form worn by dancers\n*[[Mar\u00eda Pag\u00e9s]] \u2013 a modern Spanish dancer and choreographer, considered the paramount representative of flamenco vanguard\n*[[Cristina Hoyos]] \u2013 a Spanish flamenco dancer, choreographer and actress who played an important role during the opening and closing ceremonies of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]]\n*[[Vicente Amigo]] \u2013 a Spanish flamenco composer and guitarist\n*[[Anto\u00f1ita Singla]] \u2013 a Catalonian flamenco dancer and actress known as \"La Singla\" who took Spain and Europe by storm in the period 1960-1988.}}\n\n== Sources ==\n\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|title=The Unity of Music and Dance in World Cultures|last=Akombo|first=David|place=North Carolina|publisher=McFarland Books|year=2016|isbn=978-0786497157}}.\n* \u00c1lvarez Caballero, \u00c1ngel: ''El cante flamenco'', Alianza Editorial, Madrid, Second edition, 1998. {{ISBN|84-206-9682-X}} (First edition: 1994)\n* \u00c1lvarez Caballero, \u00c1ngel: ''La Discograf\u00eda ideal del cante flamenco'', Planeta, Barcelona, 1995. {{ISBN|84-08-01602-4}}\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Anon.|2010}}|reference=Anon. 2010. \"[http://es.noticias.yahoo.com/5/20101116/tlc-el-flamenco-es-declarado-patrimonio-d712def.html El flamenco es declarado Patrimonio Cultural Inmaterial de la Humanidad por la Unesco]\"{{Dead link|date=July 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}, Yahoo Noticias, 16 de noviembre de 2010 (accessed 16 November 2010).}}\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Anon.|2012}}|reference=Anon. \"[http://www.flamenco-events.com/palosetcompas.html Palos & compas] \".

In a wider sense, the term is used to refer to a variety of Spanish musical styles. The oldest record of flamenco music dates to 1774 in the book ''Las Cartas Marruecas'' by [[Jos\u00e9 Cadalso]] {{harv|Akombo|2016|loc=240\u2013241}}. Flamenco has been influenced by and associated with the [[Romani people in Spain]]; however, its origin and style are uniquely Andalusian {{harv|Hayes|2009|loc=31\u201337}}.\n\nManuel R\u00edos Ruiz notes that the development of flamenco is well documented: \"the theatre movement of [[Sainete|sainetes]] (one-act plays) and [[Tonadilla|tonadillas]], popular song books and song sheets, customs, studies of dances, and ''toques'', perfection, newspapers, graphic documents in paintings and engravings....in continuous evolution together with rhythm, the poetic stanzas, and the ambiance\" {{harv|R\u00edos Ruiz|1997|loc={{Page needed|date=October 2019}}}}.\n\nNevertheless, the exact origin of flamenco is unknown and the subject of many hypotheses. The most widespread is that flamenco was developed through the cross-cultural interchange between [[Andalusians|native Andalusians]], [[Romani people|Romani]], [[Castilians]], [[Moors]] and [[Sephardic Jews]] in Andalusia during the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Umayyad rule]]. {{harv|Machin-Autenrieth|2015|loc={{Page needed|date=October 2019}}}}.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} The ''[[Diccionario de la lengua espa\u00f1ola]]'' (Dictionary of the Spanish Language) primarily attributes the creation of the style directly to the [[Spanish Romani]] {{harv|Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola|2019|loc=sense 4}}.\n\nFlamenco has become popular all over the world, especially the [[United States]] and [[Japan]]. In Japan, there are more flamenco academies than there are in Spain {{harv|Mendoza|2011|loc=52}}. \"In El Salvador the group Alma Flamenca is considered the maximum representative and pioneer of this musical movement\" {{harv|Mendoza|2011|loc=52}}.\n\nOn November 16, 2010, [[UNESCO]] declared flamenco one of the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]] {{harv|Anon.|2010}}.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThere are many suggestions for the origin of the word ''flamenco'' as a musical term, but no solid evidence for any of them. The word is Spanish for \"Flemish\" (meaning \"native of [[Flanders]]\", a one-time Spanish possession) {{harv|Harper|n.d.}}. The Spanish verb ''flamear'' means ''to flamb\u00e9''. The word was not recorded as a musical and dance term until the late 18th century, in the book ''Las Cartas Marruecas'' by [[Jos\u00e9 Cadalso]] (1774) {{harv|Akombo|2016|loc=240\u2013241}}.\n\nOne theory, proposed by Andalusian historian [[Blas Infante]], is that the word is derived from the Hispano-[[Arabic language|Arabic]] term ''[[Fellah|fellah mengu]]'', meaning \"expelled peasant\", referring to the Andalusians of [[Islamic]] faith and the remaining [[Moriscos]] who fled with the [[Romani people|Roma]] newcomers ({{harvnb|Infante|2010|loc=166}}; {{harvnb|Herrera|2006}}).\n\nAnother theory is that the Spanish word ''[[wikt:flamenco#Spanish|flamenco]]'' is a derivative of the Spanish word, meaning \"[[fire]]\" or \"flame\".  The word ''flamenco'' may have been used for fiery behaviour, which could have come to be applied to the [[Romani people in Spain|Gitano]] players and performers {{harv|Ruiz|2007|loc=165ff}}.\n\n== ''Palos'' ==\n{{Main|Palo (flamenco)}}\n[[File:Palos flamencos.jpg|thumb|The ''Palos'' of Flamenco]]\n''[[Palo (flamenco)|Palos]]'' (formerly known as ''cantes'') are flamenco styles, classified by criteria such as rhythmic pattern, [[Musical mode|mode]], [[chord progression]], [[stanza]]ic form and geographic origin. There are over 50 different ''palos'', some are sung unaccompanied while others have guitar or other accompaniment. Some forms are danced while others are not. Some are reserved for men and others for women while some may be performed by either, though these traditional distinctions are breaking down: the ''Farruca'', for example, once a male dance, is now commonly performed by women too.\n\nThere are many ways to categorize ''Palos'' but they traditionally fall into three classes: the most serious is known as ''[[cante jondo]]'' (or ''[[Cante flamenco#Cante Grande (also known as cante jondo)|cante grande]]''), while lighter, frivolous forms are called ''[[Cante Chico|cante chico]]''. Forms that do not fit either category are classed as ''[[Cante Intermedio|cante intermedio]]'' {{harv|Pohren|2005|loc=68}}. These are the best known ''palos'' ({{harvnb|Anon.|2019}}; {{harvnb|Anon.|2012}}):\n\n* [[Alegr\u00edas]]\n* [[Buler\u00edas]]\n* [[Sole\u00e1 por Buler\u00edas|Buler\u00edas por sole\u00e1 (sole\u00e1 por buler\u00edas)]]\n* Caracoles\n* [[Cartageneras]]\n* [[Fandango]]\n* Fandango de Huelva\n* Fandango Malague\u00f1o\n* [[Farruca]]\n* [[Grana\u00edna]]s\n* [[Guajiras (Flamenco)|Guajiras]]\n* [[Malague\u00f1as (flamenco style)|Malague\u00f1as]]\n* Martinete\n* Mineras\n* Nanas\n* [[Peteneras]]\n* Ronde\u00f1as\n* [[Saeta (flamenco)|Saeta]]\n* [[Siguiriyas|Seguiriyas]]\n* [[Sole\u00e1]]\n* [[Tango (flamenco)|Tangos]]\n* Tanguillos\n* Tarantos\n* [[Tientos (Flamenco)|Tientos]]\n* Villancicos\n\n== Music ==\n{{Quote|There are three fundamental elements which can help define whether or not something really is flameco: A flamenco mode -or musical tonality-; the ''comp\u00e1s'' -rhythm- and the performer...who should be a Flamenco! All three of these elements: tonality, ''comp\u00e1s'', a flamenco performer and then something less easily identifiable- ''Flamencura''- must be present together if we are to wend up with a piece of music which can be labelled 'flamenco'. By themselves, these elements won't turn a piece of music into flamenco.|{{harv|Martinez|2011|loc=6}}}}\n{{Quote|Three fundamental elements that help define whether or not a dance belongs to the Flamenco genre are the presence of a Flamenco mode (musical tonality), ''compas'', and a Flamenco performer (Martinez, 2003). These three elements contribute to the authenticity of a Flamenco performance also known as ''flamencura'' (Martinez, 2003). There is also no such thing as a passive audience during Flamenco performances {{bracket|[[participatory art|participatory music]]}}. The audience joins in the performance by clapping their hands and even sometimes singing along (Totton, 2003).|{{harv|Akombo|2016|loc=243}}}}\n\n=== Structure ===\nA typical flamenco recital with voice and guitar accompaniment comprises a series of pieces (not exactly \"songs\") in different palos. Each song is a set of verses (called ''copla'', ''tercio'', or ''letras''), punctuated by guitar interludes (''[[falseta]]s''). The guitarist also provides a short introduction setting the tonality, ''comp\u00e1s'' (see below) and tempo of the cante {{harv|Manuel|2006|loc=98}}. In some palos, these falsetas are played with a specific structure too; for example, the typical [[sevillanas]] is played in an AAB pattern, where A and B are the same falseta with only a slight difference in the ending {{harv|Martin|2002|loc=48}}.\n\n=== Harmony ===\nFlamenco uses the [[Flamenco mode]] (which can also be described as the [[Phrygian mode#Modern Phrygian mode|modern Phrygian mode]] (''modo frigio''), or a harmonic version of that scale with a major 3rd [[degree (music)|degree]]), in addition to the [[major scale|major]] and [[minor scale|minor]] scales commonly used in modern Western music. The Phrygian mode occurs in ''palos'' such as [[Soleares|sole\u00e1]], most [[buler\u00edas]], [[siguiriya]]s, [[tango (flamenco)|tangos]] and [[tientos]].\n[[File:E Phrygian Scale.PNG|frame|left|Descending E Phrygian scale in flamenco music, with common alterations in parentheses]]\n\nA typical [[chord sequence]], usually called the \"[[Andalusian cadence]]\" may be viewed as in a modified Phrygian: in E the sequence is '''Am\u2013G\u2013F\u2013E''' {{harv|Manuel|2006|loc=96}}. According to [[Manolo Sanl\u00facar]] '''E''' is here the [[tonic (music)|tonic]], '''F''' has the [[diatonic function|harmonic function]] of [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] while '''Am''' and '''G''' assume the functions of [[subdominant]] and [[mediant]] respectively {{harv|Torres Cort\u00e9s|2001}}.\n\nGuitarists tend to use only two basic inversions or \"chord shapes\" for the [[tonic (music)|tonic]] [[chord (music)]], the open 1st inversion '''E''' and the open 3rd inversion '''A''', though they often [[Transposition (music)|transpose]] these by using a [[capo]]. Modern guitarists such as [[Ram\u00f3n Montoya]], have introduced other positions: Montoya himself started to use other chords for the tonic in the [[Dorian mode|modern Dorian]] sections of several ''palos''; '''F{{music|sharp}}''' for ''[[Tarantella|tarantas]]'', '''B''' for ''[[grana\u00edna]]s'' and '''A{{music|flat}}''' for the ''minera''. Montoya also created a new ''palo'' as a solo for guitar, the ''[[ronde\u00f1a]]'' in '''C{{music|sharp}}''' with ''[[scordatura]]''. Later guitarists have further extended the repertoire of [[tonality|tonalities]], chord positions and ''scordatura''.\n\nThere are also ''palos'' in major mode; most [[canti\u00f1as]] and [[alegr\u00edas]], [[guajiras]], some ''[[buler\u00edas]]'' and ''[[ton\u00e1s]]'', and the ''cabales'' (a major type of ''[[siguiriyas]]''). The minor mode is restricted to the ''[[Farruca]]'', the ''milongas'' (among ''[[cantes de ida y vuelta]]''), and some styles of ''tangos, buler\u00edas'', etc. In general traditional palos in major and minor mode are limited harmonically to two-chord (tonic\u2013dominant) or three-chord (tonic\u2013subdominant\u2013dominant) progressions {{harv|Rossy|1998|loc=92}}. However modern guitarists have introduced [[chord substitution]], transition chords, and even [[modulation (music)|modulation]].\n\n''[[Fandangos]]'' and derivative ''palos'' such as ''[[Malague\u00f1as (flamenco style)|malague\u00f1as]]'', ''tarantas'' and ''[[cartageneras]] are bimodal'': guitar introductions are in Phrygian mode while the singing develops in major mode, modulating to Phrygian at the end of the stanza {{harv|Rossy|1998|loc=92}}.\n\n=== Melody ===\nDionisio Preciado, quoted by Sabas de {{harvtxt|Hoces|1982|loc={{Page needed|date=October 2019}}}}, established the following characteristics for the melodies of flamenco singing:\n\n#[[Microtonality]]: presence of [[interval (music)|intervals]] smaller than the [[semitone]].\n#[[Portamento]]: frequently, the change from one note to another is done in a smooth transition, rather than using discrete intervals.\n#Short [[tessitura]] or [[range (music)|range]]: Most traditional flamenco songs are limited to a range of a sixth (four tones and a half). The impression of vocal effort is the result of using different [[timbre]]s, and variety is accomplished by the use of microtones.\n#Use of [[enharmonic scale]]. While in [[equal temperament]] scales, [[enharmonic]]s are notes with identical pitch but different spellings (e.g. A\u266d and G\u266f); in flamenco, as in [[Equal temperament|unequal temperament]] scales, there is a microtonal intervalic difference between enharmonic notes.\n#Insistence on a note and its contiguous chromatic notes (also frequent in the guitar), producing a sense of urgency.\n#Baroque [[ornament (music)|ornamentation]], with an expressive, rather than merely aesthetic function.\n#Apparent lack of regular rhythm, especially in the [[siguiriyas]]: the melodic rhythm of the sung line is different from the metric rhythm of the accompaniment.\n#Most styles express sad and bitter feelings.\n#Melodic [[improvisation]]: flamenco singing is not, strictly speaking, improvised, but based on a relatively small number of traditional songs, singers add variations on the spur of the moment.\n\nMusicologist Hip\u00f3lito Rossy adds the following characteristics {{harv|Rossy|1998|loc=97}}:\n\n*Flamenco melodies are characterized by a descending tendency, as opposed to, for example, a typical opera [[aria]], they usually go from the higher pitches to the lower ones, and from [[Dynamics (music)|forte]] to [[Dynamics (music)|piano]], as was usual in ancient Greek scales.\n*In many styles, such as [[Soleares|sole\u00e1]] or [[siguiriya]], the melody tends to proceed in contiguous [[degree (music)|degrees]] of the scale. [[Steps and skips|Skips]] of a third or a fourth are rarer. However, in [[fandangos]] and fandango-derived styles, fourths and sixths can often be found, especially at the beginning of each line of verse. According to Rossy, this is proof of the more recent creation of this type of songs, influenced by Castilian [[jota (music)|jota]].\n\n=== Comp\u00e1s ===\n'''Comp\u00e1s''' is the Spanish word for [[metre (music)|metre]] or [[time signature]] (in classical [[music theory]]). It also refers to the rhythmic cycle, or layout, of a ''palo''.\n\nThe comp\u00e1s is fundamental to flamenco. Comp\u00e1s is most often translated as [[rhythm]] but it demands far more precise interpretation than any other Western style of music. If there is no guitarist available, the comp\u00e1s is rendered through hand clapping (''palmas'') or by hitting a table with the knuckles. The guitarist uses techniques like strumming (''rasgueado'') or tapping the [[sound board (music)|soundboard]] (''golpe''). Changes of chords emphasize the most important downbeats.\n\nFlamenco uses three basic counts or measures: Binary, Ternary and a form of a twelve-beat cycle that is unique to flamenco. There are also free-form styles including, among others, the [[ton\u00e1s]], [[Saeta (flamenco)|saetas]], [[Malague\u00f1as (flamenco style)|malague\u00f1as]], tarantos, and some types of [[fandangos]].\n\n*Rhythms in {{music|time|2|4}} or {{music|time|4|4}}. These metres are used in forms like [[tango (flamenco)|tangos]], [[tientos]], [[Flamenco Rumba|gypsy rumba]], [[zambra]] and tanguillos.\n*Rhythms in {{music|time|3|4}}. These are typical of [[fandangos]] and [[sevillanas]], suggesting their origin as non-Roma styles, since the {{music|time|3|4}} and {{music|time|4|4}} measures are not common in ethnic Roma music.\n*12-beat rhythms usually rendered in amalgams of {{music|time|6|8}} + {{music|time|3|4}} and sometimes {{music|time|12|8}}. The 12-beat cycle is the most common in flamenco, differentiated by the accentuation of the beats in different palos. The accents do not correspond to the classic concept of the downbeat. The alternating of groups of 2 and 3 beats is also common in Spanish folk dances of the 16th Century such as the ''zarabanda'', ''j\u00e1cara'' and ''canarios''.\n\nThere are three types of 12-beat rhythms, which vary in their layouts, or use of accentuations: sole\u00e1, seguiriya and buler\u00eda.\n\n#[[peteneras]] and [[guajiras]]: 1 2 '''3''' 4 5 '''6''' 7 '''8''' 9 '''10''' 11 '''12'''. Both palos start with the strong accent on 12. Hence the meter is  '''12''' 1 2 '''3''' 4 5 '''6''' 7 '''8''' 9 '''10''' 11...\n#The [[seguiriya]], liviana<!-- liviana links to a page about a genus of moths-->, [[Palo (flamenco)|serrana]], ton\u00e1 liviana, cabales: '''12'''1 '''2''' 3 '''4''' 5 6 '''7''' 8 9 '''10''' 11 '''12'''.\n#[[Soleares|sole\u00e1]], within the [[canti\u00f1as]] group of palos which includes the [[alegr\u00edas]], canti\u00f1as, mirabras, romera, caracoles and sole\u00e1 por buler\u00eda (also \"[[Buler\u00edas|buler\u00eda por sole\u00e1]]\"): 1 2 '''3''' 4 5 '''6''' 7 '''8''' 9 '''10''' 11 '''12'''. For practical reasons, when transferring flamenco guitar music to sheet music, this rhythm is written as a regular {{music|time|3|4}}.\n\nThe [[Buler\u00edas]] is the emblematic palo of flamenco: today its 12-beat cycle is most often played with accents on the 3rd, 6th, 8th, 10th and 12th beats. The accompanying ''palmas'' are played in groups of 6 beats, giving rise to a multitude of counter-rhythms and percussive voices within the 12 beat comp\u00e1s.  In certain regions like, Xerez, Spain, the rhythm stays in a simpler six-count rhythm, only including the twelve count in a musical resolve.{{Clarify|date=October 2019|reason=What is a \"musical resolve\"?}}\n\n[[File:Flamenco Compas.theora.ogv|thumb|400 px|none|Flamenco [[Buler\u00edas]] with emphasis as '''[12]''' 1 2 '''[3]''' 4 5 '''[6]''' 7 '''[8]''' 9 '''[10]''' 11 \u2013 also the rhythm for the song [[America (West Side Story song)|''America'' from the ''West Side Story'']]]]\n\n== Forms of flamenco expression ==\n\n=== Toque (guitar) ===\n\n{{Main|Flamenco guitar}}\n\n[[File:Paco de lucia 2007.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Paco de Luc\u00eda]], one of the most commercially successful exponents of flamenco {{harv|Koster|2002|loc=5}}]]\n\nThe origins, history and importance of the flamenco guitar is covered in the main Wikipedia entry for the [[Flamenco guitar]].\n\n=== Cante (song) ===\n{{Main|Cante flamenco}}\n\n[[File:Flamenco 001.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|Flamenco performance by the La Primavera group]]\n\nThe origins, history and importance of the cante is covered in the main Wikipedia entry for the [[cante flamenco]].\n\n=== Baile (dance) ===\n\n''El baile flamenco'' is known for its emotional intensity, proud carriage, expressive use of the arms and rhythmic stamping of the feet, unlike [[tap dance]] or [[Irish dance]] which use different techniques. As with any dance form, many different styles of flamenco have developed.\n\nIn the twentieth century, flamenco danced informally at gitano (Roma) celebrations in Spain was considered the most \"authentic\" form of flamenco. There was less virtuoso technique in gitano flamenco, but the music and steps are fundamentally the same. The arms are noticeably different from classical flamenco, curving around the head and body rather than extending, often with a bent elbow.\n[[File:Tablao Cordob\u00e9s 06.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Flamenco, C\u00f3rdoba]]\n\"Flamenco puro\" otherwise known as \u201cflamenco por derecho\u201d is considered the form of performance flamenco closest to its gitano influences. In this style, the dance is often performed solo, and is based on signals and calls of structural improvisation rather than choreographed. In the improvisational style, castanets are not often used. \n\n\"Classical flamenco\" is the style most frequently performed by Spanish flamenco dance companies. It is danced largely in a proud and upright style. For women, the back is often held in a marked back bend. Unlike the more gitano influenced styles, there is little movement of the hips, the body is tightly held and the arms are long, like a [[ballet]] dancer. In fact many of the dancers in these companies are trained in Ballet Cl\u00e1sico Espa\u00f1ol more than in the improvisational language of flamenco. Flamenco has both influenced and been influenced by Ballet Cl\u00e1sico Espa\u00f1ol, as evidenced by the fusion of the two ballets created by 'La Argentinita' in the early part of the twentieth century and later, by [[Joaqu\u00edn Cort\u00e9s]], eventually by the entire Ballet Nacional de Espa\u00f1a et al.\n\nIn the 1950s [[Jose Greco]] was one of the most famous male Flamenco dancers, performing on stage worldwide and on television including the [[Ed Sullivan Show]], and reviving the art almost singlehandedly.  Greco\u2019s company left a handful of prominent pioneers, most notably: Maria Benitez and Vicente Romero of New Mexico.  Today, there are many centers of Flamenco art.  Albuquerque, New Mexico is considered the \u201cCenter of the Nation\u201d for Flamenco Art. Much of this is due to Maria Benitez\u2019s 37 years of sold-out summer seasons. Albuquerque boasts three distinct prominent centers: National Institute of Flamenco, Casa Flamenca and Flamenco Works. Each center dedicates time to daily training, cultural diffusion and world-class performance equaled only to world-class performances one would find in the heart of Southern Spain, Andaluc\u00eda.\n\nModern flamenco is a highly technical dance style requiring years of study. The emphasis for both male and female performers is on lightning-fast footwork performed with absolute precision. In addition, the dancer may have to dance while using props such as castanets, canes, shawls and fans.\n\n\"[[New Flamenco|Flamenco nuevo]]\" is a recent marketing phenomenon in Flamenco. Marketed as a \u201cnewer version\u201d of Flamenco, its roots came from world-music promoters trying to sell albums of artists who created music that \u201csounded like\u201d or had Spanish-style influences.  Though some of this music was played in similar pitches, scales and was well-received, it has little to nothing to do with the Art of Flamenco guitar, dance, cante Jondo or the improvisational language.  \u201cNuevo Flamenco\u201d consists largely of compositions and repertoire, while Traditional Flamenco music and dance is a language composed of stanzas, actuated by oral formulaic calls and signals.\n\n[[File:Deborah Greenfield.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Los Angeles, United States]]\nThe flamenco most foreigners are familiar with is a style that was developed as a spectacle for tourists. To add variety, group dances are included and even solos are more likely to be choreographed. The frilly, voluminous spotted dresses are derived from a style of dress worn for the [[Sevillanas]] at the annual [[Seville Fair|Feria]] in [[Seville]].\n\nIn traditional flamenco, only the very young or older dancers are considered to have the emotional innocence or maturity to adequately convey the ''[[Duende (art)|duende]]'' (soul) of the genre {{harv|Anon.|n.d.}}. Therefore, unlike other dance forms, where dancers turn professional through techniques early on to take advantage of youth and strength, many flamenco dancers do not hit their peak until their thirties and will continue to perform into their fifties and beyond.  One artist that is considered a young master is Juan Manuel Fernandez Montoya, otherwise known as \u201cFarruquito.\u201d  At age 12, Farruquito was considered a pioneer and for \u201cFlamenco Puro,\u201d or \u201cFlamenco por Derecho,\u201d because of his emotional depth.  \n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Castelucho.jpg|[[Claudio Castelucho]], Flamenco\nFile:Theatre Flamenco Work Sample.webm|Theatre Flamenco Work Sample\nFile:Baile andaluz 1893 Jos\u00e9 Villegas Cordero.jpg|[[Jos\u00e9 Villegas Cordero]], Baile Andaluz\nFile:Sargent John Singer Spanish Dancer.jpg|[[John Singer Sargent]], Spanish Dancer\n</gallery>\n\n;Scenes of flamenco performance in Seville.\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFlamenco en el Palacio Andaluz, Sevilla, Espa\u00f1a, 2015-12-06, DD 07.JPG\nFlamenco en el Palacio Andaluz, Sevilla, Espa\u00f1a, 2015-12-06, DD 11.JPG\nFlamenco en el Palacio Andaluz, Sevilla, Espa\u00f1a, 2015-12-06, DD 20.JPG\nFlamenco en el Palacio Andaluz, Sevilla, Espa\u00f1a, 2015-12-06, DD 23.JPG\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Latin music|Music}}\n{{columns-list|\n*[[Andalusian Centre of Flamenco]] \u2013 an institution in Spain founded in 1993 to safeguard and promote the values and standards of flamenco\n*[[Concurso de Cante Jondo]] \u2013 (Contest of the Deep Song) was a fiesta of flamenco arts, music, song, and dance, held in [[Granada]] in 1922\n*[[Festival Bienal Flamenco]] \u2013 in theatres [[Seville]], this festival features flamenco puro to innovative new works by dancers, vocalists and guitarists\n*[[Flamenco rumba]] \u2013 a style of flamenco music\n*[[Flamenco rock]] \u2013 a rock music subgenre that emerged from Andalusia\n*[[Flamenco shoes]] \u2013 commonly leather shoes constructed with small nails embedded in the toe and heel to enhance the sound of the dancer's percussive footwork\n*[[Latin Grammy Award for Best Flamenco Album]]\n*''[[Kumpan\u00eda: Flamenco Los Angeles]]'' \u2013 a 2011 independent documentary film exploring the origins and contemporary Spanish culture of flamenco\n*[[New Flamenco]] \u2013 a derivative of traditional flamenco [[Fusion (music)|fusing]] flamenco guitar virtuosity with other musical styles\n*[[Camar\u00f3n de la Isla]] \u2013 considered one of the all-time greatest flamenco singers\n*[[Paco de Lucia]] \u2013 a Spanish virtuoso flamenco guitarist, composer, and record producer\n*[[David Pe\u00f1a Dorantes]] \u2013 a Romani flamenco pianist and composer from Andalusia\n*[[Ni\u00f1o Josele]] \u2013 a Spanish guitarist, and exponent of the New flamenco style\n*[[Paco Pe\u00f1a]] \u2013 regarded as one of the world's foremost traditional flamenco guitar players\n*[[Sevillanas]] \u2013 a type of folk music and dance of Seville and its region, influenced by flamenco\n*[[Silverio Franconetti]] \u2013 a singer and the leading figure of the period in flamenco history known as \"The Golden Age\"\n*[[Tablao]] \u2013 a place where flamenco shows are performed and the term used for the flamenco dance floor\n*[[Tomatito]] \u2013 a Spanish roma flamenco guitarist\n*[[Traje de flamenca]] \u2013 the dress traditionally worn by women at festivals in Andalusia; one form worn by dancers\n*[[Mar\u00eda Pag\u00e9s]] \u2013 a modern Spanish dancer and choreographer, considered the paramount representative of flamenco vanguard\n*[[Cristina Hoyos]] \u2013 a Spanish flamenco dancer, choreographer and actress who played an important role during the opening and closing ceremonies of the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]]\n*[[Vicente Amigo]] \u2013 a Spanish flamenco composer and guitarist\n*[[Anto\u00f1ita Singla]] \u2013 a Catalonian flamenco dancer and actress known as \"La Singla\" who took Spain and Europe by storm in the period 1960-1988.}}\n\n== Sources ==\n\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|title=The Unity of Music and Dance in World Cultures|last=Akombo|first=David|place=North Carolina|publisher=McFarland Books|year=2016|isbn=978-0786497157}}.\n* \u00c1lvarez Caballero, \u00c1ngel: ''El cante flamenco'', Alianza Editorial, Madrid, Second edition, 1998. {{ISBN|84-206-9682-X}} (First edition: 1994)\n* \u00c1lvarez Caballero, \u00c1ngel: ''La Discograf\u00eda ideal del cante flamenco'', Planeta, Barcelona, 1995. {{ISBN|84-08-01602-4}}\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Anon.|2010}}|reference=Anon. 2010. \"[http://es.noticias.yahoo.com/5/20101116/tlc-el-flamenco-es-declarado-patrimonio-d712def.html El flamenco es declarado Patrimonio Cultural Inmaterial de la Humanidad por la Unesco]\"{{Dead link|date=July 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}, Yahoo Noticias, 16 de noviembre de 2010 (accessed 16 November 2010).}}\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Anon.|2012}}|reference=Anon. \"[http://www.flamenco-events.com/palosetcompas.html Palos & compas] \".

He adopted a military career at the outset of the [[American Revolutionary War]], where his military exploits and fiery personality quickly earned him promotion to brigadier general and the nickname \"Mad Anthony\". He later served as the Senior Officer of the Army on the [[Ohio Country]] frontier and led the [[Legion of the United States]].\n\nWayne was born in [[Chester County, Pennsylvania]], and worked as a tanner and surveyor after attending the [[Academy and College of Philadelphia|College of Philadelphia]]. He was elected to the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly]] and helped raise a Pennsylvania militia unit in 1775. During the Revolutionary War, he served in the [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|Invasion of Quebec]], the [[Philadelphia campaign]], and the [[Yorktown campaign]]. His reputation suffered due to his defeat in the [[Battle of Paoli]], but he won wide praise for his leadership in the 1779 [[Battle of Stony Point]]. He was promoted to Major General in 1783 but retired from the Continental Army soon after.\n\nAfter the war, Wayne settled in Georgia on land that had been granted to him for his military service. He briefly represented Georgia in the House of Representatives, then returned to the Army to accept command of U.S. forces in the [[Northwest Indian War]]. His forces defeated the [[Western Confederacy]], an alliance of several Indian tribes, at the 1794 [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]], and he masterminded the [[Treaty of Greenville]] which ended the war.\n\nWayne died in 1796 in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]], while on active duty.\n\n==Early life==\nWayne was one of four children born to [[Isaac Wayne (1699-1774)|Isaac Wayne]], who had immigrated to [[Easttown Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania]], from Ireland, and Elizabeth Iddings Wayne. He was part of a Protestant Anglo-Irish family; his grandfather was a veteran of the [[Battle of the Boyne]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hsp.org/blogs/archival-adventures-in-small-repositories/mad-anthony-wayne|title=\"Mad\" Anthony Wayne|last=Caust-Ellenbogen|first=Celia|date=|website=Historical Society of Pennsylvania|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 15, 2020}}</ref> Wayne was born on January 1, 1745, on his family's [[Waynesborough]] estate.<ref>Nelson, 5\u20136</ref> He was educated as a surveyor at his uncle's private academy in Philadelphia as well as at the [[College of Philadelphia]], although he did not earn a degree. In 1765, [[Benjamin Franklin]] sent him and some associates to work for a year surveying land granted in Nova Scotia, and he assisted with starting a settlement the following year at [[The Township of Monckton]].<ref>Labaree, 345-50</ref> In 1767, he returned to work in his father's tannery while continuing work as a surveyor. He became a prominent figure in Chester County and served in the Pennsylvania legislature from 1774 to 1780. He married Mary Penrose in 1766 and they had two children. Their daughter Margretta was born in 1770 and their son [[Isaac Wayne]] was born in 1772 and later became a Representative from Pennsylvania.<ref>[http://genealogycenter.info/bibles/viewbiblepage_wayneanthony.php?p=10 Anthony and Mary (Penrose) Wayne Family Bible]</ref>\n\n==American Revolution==\n[[File:General Anthony Wayne Statue.JPG|thumb|left|A statue of General Wayne stands in Fort Wayne's Freimann Square]]\n\nWayne raised a militia unit in 1775 and became colonel of the [[4th Pennsylvania Regiment]] in 1776. He and his regiment were part of the [[Continental Army]]'s unsuccessful [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|invasion of Canada]] where he was sent to aid [[Benedict Arnold]]. Wayne commanded a successful rear-guard action at the [[Battle of Trois-Rivi\u00e8res]] and then led the distressed forces on Lake Champlain at [[Fort Ticonderoga]] and [[Mount Independence (Vermont)|Mount Independence]]. His service led to his promotion to brigadier general on February 21, 1777.\n\nOn September 11, 1777, Wayne commanded the [[Pennsylvania Line]] at the [[Battle of Brandywine]] where they held off General [[Wilhelm von Knyphausen]] in order to protect the American right flank. The two forces fought for three hours until the American line withdrew and Wayne was ordered to retreat.<ref>Nelson, 52</ref> He was then ordered to harass the British rear in order to slow [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|General Howe's]] advance towards Pennsylvania. Wayne's camp was attacked on the night of September 20\u201321 in the [[Battle of Paoli]]. General [[Charles Grey, 1st Earl Grey|Charles Grey]] had ordered his men to remove their flints and attack with bayonets in order to keep their assault secret.<ref>Nelson, 55\u201358</ref> The attack earned General Grey the nickname \"No Flint\", but the Americans pointed to the tactics and casualties as examples of British brutality. General Wayne's own reputation was tarnished by the American losses, and he demanded a formal inquiry in order to clear his name.\n\nOn October 4, 1777, Wayne again led his forces against the British in the [[Battle of Germantown]]. His soldiers pushed ahead of other units, and the British \"pushed on with their Bayonets\u2014and took Ample Vengeance\" as they retreated, according to Wayne's report.<ref>Nelson, 60</ref> Generals Wayne and [[John Sullivan (general)|Sullivan]] advanced too quickly, however, and became entrapped when they were {{Convert|2|mi||abbr=|spell=in}} ahead of other American units. They retreated as General Howe arrived to re-form the British line. General Wayne was again ordered to hold off the British and cover the rear of the retreating body.\n\nAfter winter quarters at [[Valley Forge]], Wayne led the attack at the 1778 [[Battle of Monmouth]], where his forces were abandoned by General [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]] and were pinned down by a numerically superior British force. Wayne held out until relieved by reinforcements sent by Washington. He then re-formed his troops and continued to fight.<ref>Lancaster, 195\u201397</ref> The body of Lt. Colonel [[Henry Monckton]] was discovered by the [[1st Pennsylvania Regiment]], and a legend grew that he had died fighting Wayne.\n\nIn July 1779, Washington named Wayne to command the Corps of Light Infantry, a temporary unit of four regiments of [[light infantry]] companies drawn from all the regiments in the Main Army. His successful attack on British positions in the [[Battle of Stony Point]] was the highlight of his Revolutionary War service. On July 16, 1779, he replicated the bold attack used against him at Paoli and personally led a nighttime bayonet attack lasting 30 minutes. His three columns of about 1,500 light infantry stormed and captured British fortifications at Stony Point, a cliff-side redoubt commanding the southern [[Hudson River]]. The battle ended with around 550 prisoners taken, with fewer than 100 casualties for Wayne's forces. The success of this operation provided a boost to the morale of the army, which had suffered a series of military defeats, and the Continental Congress awarded him a medal for the victory. It was after this battle that he earned the name Mad Anthony for what his fellow soldiers saw as tactical bravery and courage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Anthony-Wayne|title=Anthony Wayne Encyclopedia Britannica Entry}}</ref>\n\nOn July 21, 1780, Washington sent Wayne with two Pennsylvania brigades and four cannons to destroy a blockhouse at [[Bulls Ferry]] opposite New York City in the [[Battle of Bull's Ferry]]. Wayne's troops were unable to capture the position, suffering 64 casualties while inflicting 21 on the Loyalist defenders.<ref>Boatner, 119\u201320</ref>\n\n[[File:Anthony Wayne 1780.jpg|thumb|left|Letter from Anthony Wayne to [[Israel Shreve]], 1780]]\n\nOn January 1, 1781, Wayne served as commanding officer of the Pennsylvania Line of the Continental Army when pay and condition concerns led to the [[Pennsylvania Line Mutiny]], one of the most serious of the war. He successfully resolved the mutiny by dismissing about half the line. He returned the Pennsylvania Line to full strength by May 1781. This delayed his departure to Virginia, however, where he had been sent to assist the [[Marquis de Lafayette]] against British forces operating there, and the Line's departure was delayed once more when the men complained about being paid in the nearly worthless Continental currency.\n\nIn Virginia, Wayne led a small scouting force of 500 at the 1781 [[Battle of Green Spring]] to determine the location of Lord [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]], and they fell into a trap. Once again, Wayne held out against numerically superior forces until reinforced by Major John Wyllys. Cornwallis then attacked, and Wayne<ref>Lancaster, 319\u201322</ref> led a bayonet charge against the British forces and then retreated in good order as night set in. This increased his reputation as a bold commander.\n\nAfter the British surrendered at [[Battle of Yorktown (1781)|Yorktown]], Wayne went farther south and severed the British alliance with Indian tribes in Georgia. He then negotiated peace treaties with both the [[Creek (people)|Creeks]] and the [[Cherokees]], for which Georgia rewarded him with a large rice plantation. He was promoted to major general on October 10, 1783.\n\n==Political career==\n[[File:Valley Forge Anthony Wayne statue.jpg|thumb|Statue of Wayne at [[Valley Forge]], facing toward his home in nearby [[Paoli, Pennsylvania]]]]\nAfter the war, Wayne returned to Pennsylvania and served in the state legislature for a year in 1784. He then moved to Georgia and settled upon the tract of land that had been granted to him for his military service. He was a delegate to the state convention that ratified the [[United States Constitution]] in 1788.\n\nIn 1791, he served a year in the [[Second United States Congress]] as a Representative of [[Georgia's 1st congressional district]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=W000216 |title=WAYNE, Anthony, (1745\u20131796) |publisher=bioguide.congress.gov}}</ref> A House committee determined that electoral fraud had been committed in the 1790 election, and Wayne lost his seat over his residency qualifications. A [[Georgia's 1st congressional district special election, 1792|special election]] was held on July 9, 1792, sending [[John Milledge]] to fill Wayne's vacant seat, and Wayne declined to run for re-election in 1792.<ref>''United States Congressional Elections, 1788\u20131997: The Official Results'' confirms the seat was declared vacant on March 21, 1792.</ref>\n\n==Later military career==\n{{main|Northwest Indian War}}\n[[File:Anthony Wayne, uniform.jpg|thumb|Major-General Anthony Wayne (pastel by [[James Sharples]], Sr., c. 1795)]]\n\nPresident [[George Washington]] recalled Wayne from civilian life in order to lead an expedition in the [[Northwest Indian War]] which had been a disaster for the United States. Many American Indians in the [[Northwest Territory]] had sided with the British in the Revolutionary War, but the British had ceded the land to the United States in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris of 1783]]. The British had not consulted the Indians beforehand, and the Indians resisted annexation by the United States. The [[Western Confederacy]] achieved major victories in 1790 and 1791 under the leadership of [[Blue Jacket]] of the [[Shawnee]]s and [[Little Turtle]] of the [[Miami tribe]]. They were encouraged and supplied by the British, who had refused to evacuate British fortifications in the region despite having agreed to do so in the Treaty of Paris.\n\nWashington placed Wayne in command of a newly formed military force called the \"[[Legion of the United States]]\", and Wayne established a basic training facility at [[Legionville]] to prepare professional soldiers for his force. This was the first attempt to provide basic training for regular Army recruits, and Legionville was the first facility established expressly for this purpose. Wayne then dispatched a force to Ohio to establish [[Fort Recovery]] as a base of operations at the location of [[St. Clair's Defeat]], and the fort became a magnet for military skirmishes in the summer of 1794. Wayne's army continued north, building strategically defensive forts ahead of the main force.\n\nA tree fell on Wayne's tent on August 3, 1794, at Fort Adams in northern [[Mercer County, Ohio|Mercer County.]] He was knocked unconscious, but he recovered sufficiently to resume the march the next day to the newly built [[Fort Defiance (Ohio)|Fort Defiance]].<ref>Carter, 133</ref> On August 20, 1794, he mounted an assault on the Indian confederacy at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] in [[Maumee, Ohio]], which was a decisive victory for the U.S. forces and ended the war. Wayne then continued to [[Kekionga]] where he oversaw the construction of [[Fort Wayne (Fort)|Fort Wayne]]. He then negotiated the [[Treaty of Greenville]] between the tribal confederacy and the United States, which was signed on August 3, 1795. The treaty gave most of Ohio to the United States and cleared the way for the state to enter the Union in 1803.\n\nWayne died of complications from gout on December 15, 1796, during a return trip to Pennsylvania from a military post in Detroit. He was buried at [[Fort Presque Isle]] where the modern Wayne Blockhouse stands. His son [[Isaac Wayne]] disinterred the body in 1809 and had the corpse boiled to remove the surviving flesh from the bones.<ref name=IHA>{{cite web |title=Wayne Buried in Two Places |url=http://www.ushistory.org/paoli/history/wayneburied.htm |website=Paoli Battlefield |publisher=Independence Hall Association |via=ushistory.org |accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref> He then placed the bones into two saddlebags and relocated them to the family plot in the graveyard of [[St. David's Episcopal Church (Radnor, Pennsylvania)|St. David's Episcopal Church]] in [[Wayne, Pennsylvania]].<ref>[http://www.americanrevolution.org/wayne.html Hugh T.

He adopted a military career at the outset of the [[American Revolutionary War]], where his military exploits and fiery personality quickly earned him promotion to brigadier general and the nickname \"Mad Anthony\". He later served as the Senior Officer of the Army on the [[Ohio Country]] frontier and led the [[Legion of the United States]].\n\nWayne was born in [[Chester County, Pennsylvania]], and worked as a tanner and surveyor after attending the [[Academy and College of Philadelphia|College of Philadelphia]]. He was elected to the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly]] and helped raise a Pennsylvania militia unit in 1775. During the Revolutionary War, he served in the [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|Invasion of Quebec]], the [[Philadelphia campaign]], and the [[Yorktown campaign]]. His reputation suffered due to his defeat in the [[Battle of Paoli]], but he won wide praise for his leadership in the 1779 [[Battle of Stony Point]]. He was promoted to Major General in 1783 but retired from the Continental Army soon after.\n\nAfter the war, Wayne settled in Georgia on land that had been granted to him for his military service. He briefly represented Georgia in the House of Representatives, then returned to the Army to accept command of U.S. forces in the [[Northwest Indian War]]. His forces defeated the [[Western Confederacy]], an alliance of several Indian tribes, at the 1794 [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]], and he masterminded the [[Treaty of Greenville]] which ended the war.\n\nWayne died in 1796 in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]], while on active duty.\n\n==Early life==\nWayne was one of four children born to [[Isaac Wayne (1699-1774)|Isaac Wayne]], who had immigrated to [[Easttown Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania]], from Ireland, and Elizabeth Iddings Wayne. He was part of a Protestant Anglo-Irish family; his grandfather was a veteran of the [[Battle of the Boyne]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hsp.org/blogs/archival-adventures-in-small-repositories/mad-anthony-wayne|title=\"Mad\" Anthony Wayne|last=Caust-Ellenbogen|first=Celia|date=|website=Historical Society of Pennsylvania|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 15, 2020}}</ref> Wayne was born on January 1, 1745, on his family's [[Waynesborough]] estate.<ref>Nelson, 5\u20136</ref> He was educated as a surveyor at his uncle's private academy in Philadelphia as well as at the [[College of Philadelphia]], although he did not earn a degree. In 1765, [[Benjamin Franklin]] sent him and some associates to work for a year surveying land granted in Nova Scotia, and he assisted with starting a settlement the following year at [[The Township of Monckton]].<ref>Labaree, 345-50</ref> In 1767, he returned to work in his father's tannery while continuing work as a surveyor. He became a prominent figure in Chester County and served in the Pennsylvania legislature from 1774 to 1780. He married Mary Penrose in 1766 and they had two children. Their daughter Margretta was born in 1770 and their son [[Isaac Wayne]] was born in 1772 and later became a Representative from Pennsylvania.<ref>[http://genealogycenter.info/bibles/viewbiblepage_wayneanthony.php?p=10 Anthony and Mary (Penrose) Wayne Family Bible]</ref>\n\n==American Revolution==\n[[File:General Anthony Wayne Statue.JPG|thumb|left|A statue of General Wayne stands in Fort Wayne's Freimann Square]]\n\nWayne raised a militia unit in 1775 and became colonel of the [[4th Pennsylvania Regiment]] in 1776. He and his regiment were part of the [[Continental Army]]'s unsuccessful [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|invasion of Canada]] where he was sent to aid [[Benedict Arnold]]. Wayne commanded a successful rear-guard action at the [[Battle of Trois-Rivi\u00e8res]] and then led the distressed forces on Lake Champlain at [[Fort Ticonderoga]] and [[Mount Independence (Vermont)|Mount Independence]]. His service led to his promotion to brigadier general on February 21, 1777.\n\nOn September 11, 1777, Wayne commanded the [[Pennsylvania Line]] at the [[Battle of Brandywine]] where they held off General [[Wilhelm von Knyphausen]] in order to protect the American right flank. The two forces fought for three hours until the American line withdrew and Wayne was ordered to retreat.<ref>Nelson, 52</ref> He was then ordered to harass the British rear in order to slow [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|General Howe's]] advance towards Pennsylvania. Wayne's camp was attacked on the night of September 20\u201321 in the [[Battle of Paoli]]. General [[Charles Grey, 1st Earl Grey|Charles Grey]] had ordered his men to remove their flints and attack with bayonets in order to keep their assault secret.<ref>Nelson, 55\u201358</ref> The attack earned General Grey the nickname \"No Flint\", but the Americans pointed to the tactics and casualties as examples of British brutality. General Wayne's own reputation was tarnished by the American losses, and he demanded a formal inquiry in order to clear his name.\n\nOn October 4, 1777, Wayne again led his forces against the British in the [[Battle of Germantown]]. His soldiers pushed ahead of other units, and the British \"pushed on with their Bayonets\u2014and took Ample Vengeance\" as they retreated, according to Wayne's report.<ref>Nelson, 60</ref> Generals Wayne and [[John Sullivan (general)|Sullivan]] advanced too quickly, however, and became entrapped when they were {{Convert|2|mi||abbr=|spell=in}} ahead of other American units. They retreated as General Howe arrived to re-form the British line. General Wayne was again ordered to hold off the British and cover the rear of the retreating body.\n\nAfter winter quarters at [[Valley Forge]], Wayne led the attack at the 1778 [[Battle of Monmouth]], where his forces were abandoned by General [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]] and were pinned down by a numerically superior British force. Wayne held out until relieved by reinforcements sent by Washington. He then re-formed his troops and continued to fight.<ref>Lancaster, 195\u201397</ref> The body of Lt. Colonel [[Henry Monckton]] was discovered by the [[1st Pennsylvania Regiment]], and a legend grew that he had died fighting Wayne.\n\nIn July 1779, Washington named Wayne to command the Corps of Light Infantry, a temporary unit of four regiments of [[light infantry]] companies drawn from all the regiments in the Main Army. His successful attack on British positions in the [[Battle of Stony Point]] was the highlight of his Revolutionary War service. On July 16, 1779, he replicated the bold attack used against him at Paoli and personally led a nighttime bayonet attack lasting 30 minutes. His three columns of about 1,500 light infantry stormed and captured British fortifications at Stony Point, a cliff-side redoubt commanding the southern [[Hudson River]]. The battle ended with around 550 prisoners taken, with fewer than 100 casualties for Wayne's forces. The success of this operation provided a boost to the morale of the army, which had suffered a series of military defeats, and the Continental Congress awarded him a medal for the victory. It was after this battle that he earned the name Mad Anthony for what his fellow soldiers saw as tactical bravery and courage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Anthony-Wayne|title=Anthony Wayne Encyclopedia Britannica Entry}}</ref>\n\nOn July 21, 1780, Washington sent Wayne with two Pennsylvania brigades and four cannons to destroy a blockhouse at [[Bulls Ferry]] opposite New York City in the [[Battle of Bull's Ferry]]. Wayne's troops were unable to capture the position, suffering 64 casualties while inflicting 21 on the Loyalist defenders.<ref>Boatner, 119\u201320</ref>\n\n[[File:Anthony Wayne 1780.jpg|thumb|left|Letter from Anthony Wayne to [[Israel Shreve]], 1780]]\n\nOn January 1, 1781, Wayne served as commanding officer of the Pennsylvania Line of the Continental Army when pay and condition concerns led to the [[Pennsylvania Line Mutiny]], one of the most serious of the war. He successfully resolved the mutiny by dismissing about half the line. He returned the Pennsylvania Line to full strength by May 1781. This delayed his departure to Virginia, however, where he had been sent to assist the [[Marquis de Lafayette]] against British forces operating there, and the Line's departure was delayed once more when the men complained about being paid in the nearly worthless Continental currency.\n\nIn Virginia, Wayne led a small scouting force of 500 at the 1781 [[Battle of Green Spring]] to determine the location of Lord [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]], and they fell into a trap. Once again, Wayne held out against numerically superior forces until reinforced by Major John Wyllys. Cornwallis then attacked, and Wayne<ref>Lancaster, 319\u201322</ref> led a bayonet charge against the British forces and then retreated in good order as night set in. This increased his reputation as a bold commander.\n\nAfter the British surrendered at [[Battle of Yorktown (1781)|Yorktown]], Wayne went farther south and severed the British alliance with Indian tribes in Georgia. He then negotiated peace treaties with both the [[Creek (people)|Creeks]] and the [[Cherokees]], for which Georgia rewarded him with a large rice plantation. He was promoted to major general on October 10, 1783.\n\n==Political career==\n[[File:Valley Forge Anthony Wayne statue.jpg|thumb|Statue of Wayne at [[Valley Forge]], facing toward his home in nearby [[Paoli, Pennsylvania]]]]\nAfter the war, Wayne returned to Pennsylvania and served in the state legislature for a year in 1784. He then moved to Georgia and settled upon the tract of land that had been granted to him for his military service. He was a delegate to the state convention that ratified the [[United States Constitution]] in 1788.\n\nIn 1791, he served a year in the [[Second United States Congress]] as a Representative of [[Georgia's 1st congressional district]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=W000216 |title=WAYNE, Anthony, (1745\u20131796) |publisher=bioguide.congress.gov}}</ref> A House committee determined that electoral fraud had been committed in the 1790 election, and Wayne lost his seat over his residency qualifications. A [[Georgia's 1st congressional district special election, 1792|special election]] was held on July 9, 1792, sending [[John Milledge]] to fill Wayne's vacant seat, and Wayne declined to run for re-election in 1792.<ref>''United States Congressional Elections, 1788\u20131997: The Official Results'' confirms the seat was declared vacant on March 21, 1792.</ref>\n\n==Later military career==\n{{main|Northwest Indian War}}\n[[File:Anthony Wayne, uniform.jpg|thumb|Major-General Anthony Wayne (pastel by [[James Sharples]], Sr., c. 1795)]]\n\nPresident [[George Washington]] recalled Wayne from civilian life in order to lead an expedition in the [[Northwest Indian War]] which had been a disaster for the United States. Many American Indians in the [[Northwest Territory]] had sided with the British in the Revolutionary War, but the British had ceded the land to the United States in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris of 1783]]. The British had not consulted the Indians beforehand, and the Indians resisted annexation by the United States. The [[Western Confederacy]] achieved major victories in 1790 and 1791 under the leadership of [[Blue Jacket]] of the [[Shawnee]]s and [[Little Turtle]] of the [[Miami tribe]]. They were encouraged and supplied by the British, who had refused to evacuate British fortifications in the region despite having agreed to do so in the Treaty of Paris.\n\nWashington placed Wayne in command of a newly formed military force called the \"[[Legion of the United States]]\", and Wayne established a basic training facility at [[Legionville]] to prepare professional soldiers for his force. This was the first attempt to provide basic training for regular Army recruits, and Legionville was the first facility established expressly for this purpose. Wayne then dispatched a force to Ohio to establish [[Fort Recovery]] as a base of operations at the location of [[St. Clair's Defeat]], and the fort became a magnet for military skirmishes in the summer of 1794. Wayne's army continued north, building strategically defensive forts ahead of the main force.\n\nA tree fell on Wayne's tent on August 3, 1794, at Fort Adams in northern [[Mercer County, Ohio|Mercer County.]] He was knocked unconscious, but he recovered sufficiently to resume the march the next day to the newly built [[Fort Defiance (Ohio)|Fort Defiance]].<ref>Carter, 133</ref> On August 20, 1794, he mounted an assault on the Indian confederacy at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] in [[Maumee, Ohio]], which was a decisive victory for the U.S. forces and ended the war. Wayne then continued to [[Kekionga]] where he oversaw the construction of [[Fort Wayne (Fort)|Fort Wayne]]. He then negotiated the [[Treaty of Greenville]] between the tribal confederacy and the United States, which was signed on August 3, 1795. The treaty gave most of Ohio to the United States and cleared the way for the state to enter the Union in 1803.\n\nWayne died of complications from gout on December 15, 1796, during a return trip to Pennsylvania from a military post in Detroit. He was buried at [[Fort Presque Isle]] where the modern Wayne Blockhouse stands. His son [[Isaac Wayne]] disinterred the body in 1809 and had the corpse boiled to remove the surviving flesh from the bones.<ref name=IHA>{{cite web |title=Wayne Buried in Two Places |url=http://www.ushistory.org/paoli/history/wayneburied.htm |website=Paoli Battlefield |publisher=Independence Hall Association |via=ushistory.org |accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref> He then placed the bones into two saddlebags and relocated them to the family plot in the graveyard of [[St. David's Episcopal Church (Radnor, Pennsylvania)|St. David's Episcopal Church]] in [[Wayne, Pennsylvania]].<ref>[http://www.americanrevolution.org/wayne.html Hugh T.

That night, OA meets Steve in an abandoned house with three other boys from his school, \"French\", Buck, and Jesse, along with their teacher, Betty Broderick-Allen (\"BBA\"). She tells them that she was born in [[Russia]] as Nina Azarova, the daughter of a powerful [[Russian oligarch|oligarch]]. One day, following a premonition she had, the mafia knocked the bus of the oligarchs' children into a river. Nina had a [[near-death experience]] (NDE), where a woman named Khatun gave her the choice of returning to life.

For the next several years, Prairie had dreams and premonitions, for which her parents [[Antipsychotic|medicated]] her. In them, her father waited for her by the [[Statue of Liberty]]. She ran away on her 21st birthday to see him, but he did not appear. Instead, she met a scientist named \"Hap\". She ends her story for the night, and the boys begin to investigate whether she is telling the truth. French considers not going again when he gets a scholarship and wishes to focus on that, but Buck convinces him to come. The next night, she tells them that Hap was studying people that had NDEs, like she did. Prairie agreed to let Hap study her and flew on his private plane to his house, where he trapped her in a glass cage in his basement, with the other test subjects he had tricked over the years.\n| LineColor       = 1D1023\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = Chapter 3: Champion\n| DirectedBy      = Zal Batmanglij\n| WrittenBy       = Brit Marling & Dominic Orlando\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|12|16}}\n| ShortSummary    = In the present, a journalist approaches Prairie's mother, asking if she can write a book about their story.

He regularly pumps gas to their cages as part of an experiment, but the four cannot figure what that is, as the gas makes them pass out. BBA defends Steve from being sent to Asheville, convincing his parents to put him in [[special education]] instead. Prairie makes soup for Hap, who experiences anaphylactic shock when he eats it. He asks her to get an [[EpiPen]] from the bathroom, but there she discovers the dead body of a girl \"August\". The captives try to send a letter for help, but lose it.

She tells Prairie that five of them must work together to avert a great evil and that Prairie is \"the original\". Hap returns Prairie to her cage and she tells the others that she can see, they are all [[angels]], and their way out is by figuring Hap's experiment. In the present, BBA learns her brother Theo left her $50,000 in his will. OA meets an FBI counselor, Elias, who suggests to her that she focus on healing herself. In her story, Prairie and Rachel decide to suck Hap's [[Hyoscine#Crime|scopolamine-like]] gas, so that Homer experiences the experiment awake. Hap is revealed to be drowning them in water and recording the soundscape of their NDEs. It takes Homer four years, but he experiences an NDE awake, in which he manages to swallow a sea anemone.

With Renata now locked back at Hap's, it's Scott's turn for the experiment. Scott begs Hap to spare him as he is too sick to survive another NDE and reveals OA can see, and her ideas about angels and how to escape. Hap proceeds with the experiment and Scott dies. Hap takes his body back to his cage, telling OA it's her fault. OA and Homer do their movements for hours, while facing each other with Scott in the middle. Unexpectedly, Scott returns to life and tells them they were right; if at least five people perform the movements, a door to another dimension opens. He has been given the third of five. Hap runs downstairs in shock that Scott is alive.

Leon tells Hap he is very close to proving the existence of [[afterlife]], but Hap tells him he actually believes there are multiple dimensions, and his subjects have the means to make traveling between them possible. He also thinks he knows where their NDEs take place, and he intends to go see it with his own eyes. Leon pulls a gun on Hap demanding he reveals his breakthroughs. They fight and Hap kills him. Hap leaves the hospital and informs the staff to call the police to rescue Leon's subjects. Later, he asks OA to leave with him, make money using the first two healing movements, and run experiments on their own, but she turns him down.

French suggests to OA that she forgive Nancy and Abel and consider them as her parents because they are one of the reasons she came back from her NDEs. Steve accuses OA of using him and the rest of the group just so she can return to Homer, then stabs her leg with a pencil. She embraces him and calms him down.

Prairie disappeared blind, but now she can see, and insists that her name is \"The OA\". She does not reveal how she regained her eyesight, nor where she has been for the past seven years, although she makes vague allusions to being held hostage with others. OA tells Steve, a neighborhood bully, that she will save him from being sent to [[Boot camp (correctional)|boot camp]] in Asheville, if he presents her with four other strong people. That night, OA meets Steve in an abandoned house with three other boys from his school, \"French\", Buck, and Jesse, along with their teacher, Betty Broderick-Allen (\"BBA\"). She tells them that she was born in [[Russia]] as Nina Azarova, the daughter of a powerful [[Russian oligarch|oligarch]]. One day, following a premonition she had, the mafia knocked the bus of the oligarchs' children into a river. Nina had a [[near-death experience]] (NDE), where a woman named Khatun gave her the choice of returning to life.

However, her father died, and she was sent to live with her aunt who ran an illegal adoption service. Nancy and Abel adopted her and named her Prairie. For the next several years, Prairie had dreams and premonitions, for which her parents [[Antipsychotic|medicated]] her. In them, her father waited for her by the [[Statue of Liberty]]. She ran away on her 21st birthday to see him, but he did not appear. Instead, she met a scientist named \"Hap\". She ends her story for the night, and the boys begin to investigate whether she is telling the truth. French considers not going again when he gets a scholarship and wishes to focus on that, but Buck convinces him to come. The next night, she tells them that Hap was studying people that had NDEs, like she did. Prairie agreed to let Hap study her and flew on his private plane to his house, where he trapped her in a glass cage in his basement, with the other test subjects he had tricked over the years.\n| LineColor       = 1D1023\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = Chapter 3: Champion\n| DirectedBy      = Zal Batmanglij\n| WrittenBy       = Brit Marling & Dominic Orlando\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|12|16}}\n| ShortSummary    = In the present, a journalist approaches Prairie's mother, asking if she can write a book about their story. In the flashback, Prairie gets to know Homer, Scott and Rachel, the other three captives. Prairie makes Hap a sandwich, and he takes her on as a cook. He regularly pumps gas to their cages as part of an experiment, but the four cannot figure what that is, as the gas makes them pass out. BBA defends Steve from being sent to Asheville, convincing his parents to put him in [[special education]] instead. Prairie makes soup for Hap, who experiences anaphylactic shock when he eats it. He asks her to get an [[EpiPen]] from the bathroom, but there she discovers the dead body of a girl \"August\". The captives try to send a letter for help, but lose it. Prairie asks Hap about August, but becomes angry and pushes him down the stairs, and flees.

She is offered the choice of reuniting with her father but she chooses to return to help the others. Khatun, who shows she has a bird wing, offers Prairie to swallow a bird which will show her a way of traveling unknown to humans. She tells Prairie that five of them must work together to avert a great evil and that Prairie is \"the original\". Hap returns Prairie to her cage and she tells the others that she can see, they are all [[angels]], and their way out is by figuring Hap's experiment. In the present, BBA learns her brother Theo left her $50,000 in his will. OA meets an FBI counselor, Elias, who suggests to her that she focus on healing herself. In her story, Prairie and Rachel decide to suck Hap's [[Hyoscine#Crime|scopolamine-like]] gas, so that Homer experiences the experiment awake. Hap is revealed to be drowning them in water and recording the soundscape of their NDEs. It takes Homer four years, but he experiences an NDE awake, in which he manages to swallow a sea anemone. Prairie contemplates the possibility that she has a truer self who answers to something sounding like \"Away\" or \"Oh-A\".\n| LineColor       = 1D1023\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 5\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n| Title           = Chapter 5: Paradise\n| DirectedBy      = Zal Batmanglij\n| WrittenBy       = Brit Marling & Zal Batmanglij\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|12|16}}\n| ShortSummary    = OA (having abandoned the name Prairie) and Homer perform the two movements they got from their NDEs. Hap forces Homer to seduce an NDE survivor in [[Cuba]] named Renata, to kidnap her. Homer ends up sleeping with her, which destroys the morale of the team and hurts OA. With Renata now locked back at Hap's, it's Scott's turn for the experiment. Scott begs Hap to spare him as he is too sick to survive another NDE and reveals OA can see, and her ideas about angels and how to escape. Hap proceeds with the experiment and Scott dies. Hap takes his body back to his cage, telling OA it's her fault. OA and Homer do their movements for hours, while facing each other with Scott in the middle. Unexpectedly, Scott returns to life and tells them they were right; if at least five people perform the movements, a door to another dimension opens. He has been given the third of five. Hap runs downstairs in shock that Scott is alive. In present day, OA tells the others the reason she gathered them is to teach them the movements so that she may travel to another dimension and rescue the others.\n| LineColor       = 1D1023\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 6\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n| Title           = Chapter 6: Forking Paths\n| DirectedBy      = Zal Batmanglij\n| WrittenBy       = Melanie Marnich\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|12|16}}\n| ShortSummary    = In the following three years Renata gets the fourth movement, OA and Homer scar themselves with depictions of them, so that they don't forget them, and Hap is watching closely and learning their movements as well. Hap visits his former mentor, Leon, in a morgue, in which Leon also runs similar experiments. Leon tells Hap he is very close to proving the existence of [[afterlife]], but Hap tells him he actually believes there are multiple dimensions, and his subjects have the means to make traveling between them possible. He also thinks he knows where their NDEs take place, and he intends to go see it with his own eyes. Leon pulls a gun on Hap demanding he reveals his breakthroughs. They fight and Hap kills him. Hap leaves the hospital and informs the staff to call the police to rescue Leon's subjects. Later, he asks OA to leave with him, make money using the first two healing movements, and run experiments on their own, but she turns him down. He reveals to her he thinks her NDEs take her to the [[rings of Saturn]]. A sheriff pays Hap a visit and discovers the hostages.

She discusses it with Elias, who suggest that her \"psychic\" capability might be the result of being able to notice even the smallest cues around her. He also tells her to just accept whatever happens. Steve is being sent to Asheville but BBA uses her inheritance check to bribe the drivers to let him go. OA has dinner with her parents, when Nancy gets upset that she knows nothing about what happened to her daughter. OA explains that she scarred herself with the notations of the movements that open another dimension and she knows all this because she is \"the Original Angel\", which causes Nancy to slap her. French suggests to OA that she forgive Nancy and Abel and consider them as her parents because they are one of the reasons she came back from her NDEs. Steve accuses OA of using him and the rest of the group just so she can return to Homer, then stabs her leg with a pencil. She embraces him and calms him down.

Once healed, the sheriff's wife reveals she is an NDE survivor and can give them the fifth movement. Upon doing so, Hap kills her and her husband. He releases OA on the side of the road, telling her he will jump dimensions with the others. French breaks into OA's house, discovers some books that relate to OA's story (e.g., [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]''), and shares the revelation with the others. Days later, a [[School shooting|shooter]] approaches the school cafeteria where the boys are eating lunch. The boys and BBA, fearing for the lives of all present, desperately decide to enact OA's five movements. Bewildered, the shooter is easily subdued, but a stray bullet hits OA through the cafeteria window where she had been watching from outside. As medics tend to her, OA tells the boys and BBA that she can now feel herself going to another dimension.\n| LineColor       = 1D1023\n}}\n}}\n\n===Part II (2019)===\n{{Episode table |background=#16365C |overall=5 |season=5 |title=28 |director=13 |writer=30 |airdate=19 |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 9\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n |Title = Chapter 1: Angel of Death\n |DirectedBy = [[Zal Batmanglij]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Brit Marling]] & Zal Batmanglij\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|3|22}}\n |ShortSummary = In San Francisco, private detective Karim Washington agrees to help an elderly Vietnamese woman find her missing granddaughter, Michelle.

Meanwhile, Karim meets Marlow Rhodes, a former doctor who worked for Ruskin, who says that the house is a benefactor of the dreams. Karim realizes that the house is put on a Russian trust owned by Nina, Ruskin's girlfriend, and he decides to go see Prairie/Nina at the clinic.

They take sanctuary at a church, and French temporarily splits from the group and has a one-night-stand with a man who recommends a psychic in Nebraska for support. The group then treks there, but the vanity accidentally gets broken. At the psychic's house, she helps Rachel come into contact with the group through a television.

Prairie heads to the bar as Nina, alongside Karim, who looks for more clues in the venue. Prairie is strapped to a chair on the stage where a telepathic octopus, Old Night, straps his tentacles onto Prairie and has her communicate messages via his telepathy.

The emirate became a major base for Muslim naval raids along the coasts of the Byzantine Empire, and several attempts at reconquest failed.

Jesuit missionaries sent from their Portuguese-held Goa built a Catholic church in Lahore, the first in Punjab, around 1597, two years after being granted permission by emperor Akbar, who had called them to his court in Fatehpur Sikri for religious discussions. This church was later demolished, perhaps during Aurangzeb times. Later on, Christianity was mainly brought by the [[British Raj|British rulers]] of India in the later 18th and 19th&nbsp;century. This is evidenced in cities established by the British, such as the port city of [[Karachi]], where the majestic [[Saint Patrick's Cathedral, Karachi|St. Patrick's Cathedral]], one of Pakistan's largest church, stands, and the churches in the city of [[Rawalpindi]], where the British established a major military cantonment.\n[[File:Trinity church Karachi.JPG|thumb|Holy Trinity Cathedral, Karachi]]\nThe Europeans won{{how|date=June 2014}} small numbers of converts to [[Anglicanism]], [[Methodism]], the [[Lutheran Church]] and [[Catholicism]] from the native populations. [[Islam]] was very strong in the provinces of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] and the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u20131955)|North West Frontier Province]], but small native communities of converts to Christianity were formed. The largest numbers came from resident officers of the British Army and the government. European and wealthy native Christians established colleges, churches, hospitals and schools in cities like Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi and [[Peshawar]]. There is a large Catholic [[Goa]]n community in [[Karachi]] that was established when Karachi's infrastructure was developed by the British before World War II, and the [[Irish people|Irish]] (who were subjects of the British Empire and formed a large part of the British Army) were an important factor in the establishment of Pakistan's Catholic community.\n[[File:Night view of St. Mary's Cathedral & Bishop's House Multan.jpg|thumb|Night view of St Mary's Cathedral & Bishop's House Multan]]\nWhen Pakistan achieved independence in 1947, the organization and activities of the Christian community changed drastically. Christians in [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]] and [[Sindh]] had been quite active after 1945 in their support for Muhammad Ali [[Jinnah]]'s [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]]. Even before the final phase of the movement, leading Indian Christians like [[Pothan Joseph]] had rendered valuable services as journalists and propagandists of the Muslim League.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Jinnah had repeatedly promised all citizens of Pakistan complete equality of citizenship, but this promise was not kept by his successors. Pakistan became an [[Islamic Republic]] in 1956, making [[Islam]] the source of legislation and cornerstone of the national identity, while guaranteeing freedom of religion and equal citizenship to all citizens. In the mass population exchanges that occurred between Pakistan and India upon independence due to conflict between Muslims and followers of [[Indian religions]], most Hindus and nearly all [[Sikh]]s fled the country. [[Pakistani Punjab]] is now over 2% Christian, with very few Hindus left. Christians have made some contributions to the Pakistani national life. Pakistan's first non-Muslim Chief Justice of Pakistan Supreme Court was Justice [[A. R. Cornelius]]. Pakistani Christians also distinguished themselves as great fighter pilots in the [[Pakistan Air Force]]. Notable amongst them are [[Cecil Chaudhry]], Peter O'Reilly and [[Mervyn L Middlecoat]]. Christians have also contributed as educationists, doctors, lawyers and businessmen. One of Pakistan's [[Batting (cricket)|cricketers]], [[Yousuf Youhana]], was born Christian, but later converted to Islam, taking the Islamic name [[Mohammad Yousuf (cricketer, born 1974)|Mohammad Yousuf]]. In Britain, the bishop emeritus of Rochester [[Michael Nazir-Ali]] is a Pakistani Christian.\n\nIn 2016, it was reported that [[Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority]] (PEMRA) had banned all of the Christian television stations.

In 1971, [[East Pakistan]] became independent as [[Bangladesh]], and the majority of Pakistan's Hindus, who lived in Bangladesh, were severed from Pakistan. Pakistan became a culturally monolithic, increasingly Islamic state, with smaller religious minorities than ever.\n\nWith the governments of [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] and [[Zia ul-Haq]], more stringently Islamic laws transformed Pakistan. Conversion to other faiths than Islam is not prohibited by law, but culture and social pressures do not favour such conversions. Muslims who [[apostasy in Islam|change their faith]] to Christianity, are subject to societal pressure. Extremely controversial were the [[Blasphemy law in Pakistan|blasphemy laws]], which made it treacherous for non-Muslims to express themselves without being accused of being un-Islamic. Zia also introduced the [[Sharia]] as a basis for lawmaking, reinforced by [[Nawaz Sharif]] in 1991.

Jesuit missionaries sent from their Portuguese-held Goa built a Catholic church in Lahore, the first in Punjab, around 1597, two years after being granted permission by emperor Akbar, who had called them to his court in Fatehpur Sikri for religious discussions. This church was later demolished, perhaps during Aurangzeb times. Later on, Christianity was mainly brought by the [[British Raj|British rulers]] of India in the later 18th and 19th&nbsp;century. This is evidenced in cities established by the British, such as the port city of [[Karachi]], where the majestic [[Saint Patrick's Cathedral, Karachi|St. Patrick's Cathedral]], one of Pakistan's largest church, stands, and the churches in the city of [[Rawalpindi]], where the British established a major military cantonment.\n[[File:Trinity church Karachi.JPG|thumb|Holy Trinity Cathedral, Karachi]]\nThe Europeans won{{how|date=June 2014}} small numbers of converts to [[Anglicanism]], [[Methodism]], the [[Lutheran Church]] and [[Catholicism]] from the native populations. [[Islam]] was very strong in the provinces of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] and the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u20131955)|North West Frontier Province]], but small native communities of converts to Christianity were formed. The largest numbers came from resident officers of the British Army and the government. European and wealthy native Christians established colleges, churches, hospitals and schools in cities like Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi and [[Peshawar]]. There is a large Catholic [[Goa]]n community in [[Karachi]] that was established when Karachi's infrastructure was developed by the British before World War II, and the [[Irish people|Irish]] (who were subjects of the British Empire and formed a large part of the British Army) were an important factor in the establishment of Pakistan's Catholic community.\n[[File:Night view of St. Mary's Cathedral & Bishop's House Multan.jpg|thumb|Night view of St Mary's Cathedral & Bishop's House Multan]]\nWhen Pakistan achieved independence in 1947, the organization and activities of the Christian community changed drastically. Christians in [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]] and [[Sindh]] had been quite active after 1945 in their support for Muhammad Ali [[Jinnah]]'s [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]]. Even before the final phase of the movement, leading Indian Christians like [[Pothan Joseph]] had rendered valuable services as journalists and propagandists of the Muslim League.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Jinnah had repeatedly promised all citizens of Pakistan complete equality of citizenship, but this promise was not kept by his successors. Pakistan became an [[Islamic Republic]] in 1956, making [[Islam]] the source of legislation and cornerstone of the national identity, while guaranteeing freedom of religion and equal citizenship to all citizens. In the mass population exchanges that occurred between Pakistan and India upon independence due to conflict between Muslims and followers of [[Indian religions]], most Hindus and nearly all [[Sikh]]s fled the country. [[Pakistani Punjab]] is now over 2% Christian, with very few Hindus left. Christians have made some contributions to the Pakistani national life. Pakistan's first non-Muslim Chief Justice of Pakistan Supreme Court was Justice [[A. R. Cornelius]]. Pakistani Christians also distinguished themselves as great fighter pilots in the [[Pakistan Air Force]]. Notable amongst them are [[Cecil Chaudhry]], Peter O'Reilly and [[Mervyn L Middlecoat]]. Christians have also contributed as educationists, doctors, lawyers and businessmen. One of Pakistan's [[Batting (cricket)|cricketers]], [[Yousuf Youhana]], was born Christian, but later converted to Islam, taking the Islamic name [[Mohammad Yousuf (cricketer, born 1974)|Mohammad Yousuf]]. In Britain, the bishop emeritus of Rochester [[Michael Nazir-Ali]] is a Pakistani Christian.\n\nIn 2016, it was reported that [[Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority]] (PEMRA) had banned all of the Christian television stations.

In 1971, [[East Pakistan]] became independent as [[Bangladesh]], and the majority of Pakistan's Hindus, who lived in Bangladesh, were severed from Pakistan. Pakistan became a culturally monolithic, increasingly Islamic state, with smaller religious minorities than ever.\n\nWith the governments of [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] and [[Zia ul-Haq]], more stringently Islamic laws transformed Pakistan. Conversion to other faiths than Islam is not prohibited by law, but culture and social pressures do not favour such conversions. Muslims who [[apostasy in Islam|change their faith]] to Christianity, are subject to societal pressure. Extremely controversial were the [[Blasphemy law in Pakistan|blasphemy laws]], which made it treacherous for non-Muslims to express themselves without being accused of being un-Islamic. Zia also introduced the [[Sharia]] as a basis for lawmaking, reinforced by [[Nawaz Sharif]] in 1991. [[Forced conversion|Coerced conversions]] to Islam from Christianity are a major source of concern for Pakistani Christians, and the minority faces threats, harassment and intimidation tactics from [[extremists]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/04/28/wpak28.xml&sSheet=/news/2006/04/28/ixworld.html |title=News |work=Telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Discrimination in the Constitution===\n{{See also|Zia-ul Haq's Islamitization}} \nChristians, along with other non-Muslim minorities, are discriminated against in the [[Constitution of Pakistan]].

Boutoumites, however, kept the deal a secret, and arranged with Tatikios for a renewed assault by the Crusaders and Tatikios's men, in which the city would ostensibly be captured by the Byzantines. The ruse worked: the day of the final assault was set for June 19, but when the assault began at dawn, the Byzantines, allowed in through the lake-ward gates, raised their standards on the battlements, leaving the Crusaders outside.<ref>Anna Komnene, ''The Alexiad'', ed. {{harvnb|Sewter|2003|pp=334\u2013338}}; {{harvnb|Skoulatos|1980|pp=182\u2013183}}; {{harvnb|Runciman|1969|p=290}}; {{harvnb|Runciman|1987|p=180}}.</ref>\n\nAlthough by and large the Crusaders accepted the outcome, the event soured relations.
