Spanning twenty-nine acres and just 14 buildings, Prospect serves 1,300 students with an average class size of 30 students. The original construction began in what was originally a [[cherry]] [[orchard]] in 1966, the campus opening in September 1968 for the 1968-1969 school year. <!-- Throughout the building there is an abundance of [[chewing gum]] stuck to the hallway floors. --> Since 2005, district bonds from Measure C and state funds have renovated most of the campus, most notably:\n* In 2005, the $4.3 million science wing was completed. Designed with energy efficiency and advanced laboratories in mind, the building has automated radiant heating, an artistic sundial in the courtyard, and a robotically controlled fiberglass dome telescope.<ref name=\"campbellreporter\">http://mytown.mercurynews.com/archives/campbellreporter/20070209/cover1.shtml, 2007 Campbell Reporter article about Prospect Telescope</ref><ref>http://schooldesigns.com/Project-Details.aspx?Project_ID=2330, Architecture behind Prospect Science Facility</ref>\n* In 2006, the A-wing (English), B-wing (Administrative Facilities), and C-wing (Math and Social Sciences) were renovated.\n* In 2007, the L-wing and the library were renovated. The library, while small, features a technology center, student art showcases, extensive collections and databases, and plenty of study space and natural light. \n* In 2008, the main gymnasium was renovated. The baseball and softball fields were updated, and the two remaining fields were replaced with low-maintenance, beautiful synthetic turf fields.\n* In 2010, the locker rooms and gymnasium lobby were renovated.

The main quad was landscaped.\n* In 2012, both parking lots were redone. Solar panels were added to provide shade and renewable energy for students and faculty.<ref name=about />\n* In 2015, Johnson Field House and cooking facilities were finished with a separate building for bathrooms and general maintenance.\n*In the 2016-2017 school year, the F-wing was renovated for a large video production classroom, complete with a studio and control room. The studio was finally completed in September 2018.\n*In 2018, the Campbell Union High School District implemented fences surrounding all of its high school campuses, including Prospect.\n\nThe cafeteria and remaining wings (art, music, and CTE) are scheduled for renovation as well.<ref name=about /> In the 2016-2017 school year, it was announced that Prospect would add a new two-story STEM building to its campus. The tennis courts were removed in spring of 2018 and were replaced by August 2018 in the back field. Construction began on the STEM building in the fall of 2018. Plans were also unveiled for the addition of a new student union center in the place of the currently unused cafeteria, expected to be completed by 2021.\n\n==Other==\n* Associative Student Body (ASB) - The school's official student government. \n* [[Astronomy]] Club \u2013 Prospect High School is the only high school in the [[Bay Area]] with a working observatory{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n* [[Mock Trial]] \u2013 The school Mock Trial team won its first Santa Clara County Championship in 2006, when it defeated Palo Alto High School.<ref>http://www.campbelltimes.com/030806/prospect.htm</ref> In 2011, the Mock Trial team defeated Saratoga High School to again win the County championship.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sccoe.org/newsandfacts/newsreleases/2010-11/news030411.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205233923/http://www.sccoe.org/newsandfacts/newsreleases/2010-11/news030411.asp |archivedate=2012-02-05 }}</ref>  In 2012, the team went undefeated in the county tournament, to repeat as county champions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2012/03/05/and-the-verdict-is-prospect-wins-mock-trial-2/|title=And the verdict is?

It was the second of three Disney animated features (the others being ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' and ''[[Brother Bear]]'') produced primarily at the Florida animation studio located at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] (known as \"Disney-MGM Studios\" during production) in [[Walt Disney World]] near [[Orlando, Florida]].<ref name=\"DisneyWar-Lilo\">{{cite book |last1=Stewart |first1=James B. |title=DisneyWar |date=2005 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=9780743283908 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/disneywar00jame_0/page/472 472]\u2013473 |language=en |quote=Weeks later, on January 12, Disney announced that it was shutting down its Orlando animation unit, where ''Lilo & Stitch'' had been created.|url=https://archive.org/details/disneywar00jame_0|url-access=registration }}</ref> It was released on June 21, 2002, to positive reviews and was nominated for the 2002 [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]]. That Academy Award was won by [[Studio Ghibli]]'s 2001 film ''[[Spirited Away]]'', which was also distributed in the United States by Walt Disney Pictures, and also starred Chase and Stiers in the English version.\n\nThe film's story revolves around two [[eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]] and [[mischief|mischievous]] individuals: a young Hawaiian girl named [[Lilo Pelekai]], who is raised by her older sister Nani after their parents died in a car accident, and a blue [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial animal-like creature]] named Experiment 626, who gets adopted by Lilo as her \"dog\" and is given the name \"Stitch\". Stitch, who is genetically engineered by his scientist creator to cause chaos and destruction, initially uses Lilo to avoid being captured by an intergalactic federation, but the two individuals develop a close bond through the Hawaiian concept of ''{{okina}}[[ohana]]'', or [[extended family]]. This bond causes Stitch to reconsider, and later defy, his intended destructive purpose in order to keep his family together.\n\nThe success of the film spawned a [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|franchise]]. A [[direct-to-video]] sequel called ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]'' was released on August 26, 2003. This was followed by a television series, ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]'', which ran from September 20, 2003, to July 29, 2006. A second direct-to-video sequel, ''[[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch]]'', was released on August 30, 2005. A third sequel, a [[television film]] titled ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]'', was released on June 23, 2006, as the conclusion to the TV series. An [[anime]] series that succeeded the original television series called ''[[Stitch!]]'' ran in Japan from October 8, 2008, to June 19, 2011, with [[Television special|TV specials]] broadcast in 2012 and 2015. A [[Chinese animated series]] succeeding the ''Stitch!'' anime, ''[[Stitch & Ai]]'', ran from March 27 to April 6, 2017.\n\nOther animation studios produced the sequel films and series: ''Stitch! The Movie'', ''Lilo & Stitch: The Series'', and ''Leroy & Stitch'' were all produced by [[Disney Television Animation|Walt Disney Television Animation]]; ''Stitch Has a Glitch'' was produced by [[Disneytoon Studios]]; ''Stitch!'' was produced by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] for its first two seasons, and then [[Shin-Ei Animation]] for its third season (and two post-series specials); and ''Stitch & Ai'' was produced by Anhui Xinhua Media and Panimation Hwakai Media.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per WP:MOSFILM, plot summaries should be in the range of 400-700 words. Please do not add more detail, but adjust what is already present. -->\nIn the deep reaches of space, Dr. Jumba Jookiba, an extraterrestrial [[mad scientist]], is arrested and put on trial by the Galactic Federation for illegal genetic experimentation, as evidenced by his creation \"Experiment 626\", a small blue sentient alien with unparalleled intelligence and strength, but also a propensity to cause chaos. Jumba is imprisoned while the alien is sentenced to exile on a desert asteroid. 626 manages to escape on a red police spaceship, and activates the hyperdrive, causing its guidance systems to malfunction and randomly set a course for Earth. 626 crash-lands on [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i, Hawaii]], only to be knocked unconscious by three passing trucks and taken to an [[animal shelter]]. The Grand Councilwoman dispatches Jumba and Agent Pleakley, the Council's Earth expert, to the planet to have 626 captured as discreetly as possible, as Earth is the habitat for the supposedly \"endangered\" mosquito population, and humans are described as being unable to handle an alien encounter formally.\n\nOn Kaua{{okina}}i, a disasperated young woman named Nani Pelekai is having trouble caring for her rambunctious, disobedient, and lonely younger sister, Lilo, following the death of their parents. A social worker named Cobra Bubbles expresses increasing concern whether Nani is able to take adequate care of her sister. Since Lilo has been ostracized by her hula classmates, Nani makes no hesitation at letting her adopt a dog. At the shelter, Lilo immediately takes a keen interest in 626, who is impersonating a dog. Lilo calls 626 \"[[Stitch (Disney)|Stitch]]\", and shows him around the island.\n\nThat evening, at the restaurant where Nani works, the aliens Jumba and Pleakley try, but fail every time, to capture Stitch. The indescribable chaos is blamed on Stitch, which results in Nani getting fired. The next day, Cobra warns her that unless she finds another job, he will have to place Lilo with a foster family. However, Stitch's antics, which occur in the course of his evasion of his two pursuers, persistently ruin Nani's chances of finding work.\n\nNani's friend David invites her, Lilo, and Stitch to enjoy a day of surfing. While Nani rides a huge wave with Lilo and Stitch, Jumba makes one final effort to capture Stitch from underwater, causing Stitch to unintentionally pull Lilo underwater. They survive, but Cobra witnesses this event and tells Nani that, although she means well, Lilo has to be taken away unless Nani finds another job. Seeing how much trouble he has caused, Stitch runs off into the night.\n\nThe next morning, the Councilwoman fires Jumba and Pleakley from their assignment and gives it to the galaxy's oversized militant captain, Captain Gantu (incidentally freeing Jumba to pursue Stitch using less covert methods). Meanwhile, David informs Nani of a job opportunity, which she excitedly rushes off to pursue. Stitch, hiding in the nearby woods, encounters Jumba, who chases him back to Nani's house. A fight ensues which destroys the house; Cobra arrives to collect Lilo and take her away.\n\nAs Nani and Cobra argue, Lilo runs away into the woods and finds Stitch, who reveals his alien identity, enraging her, just before they are captured by Gantu. Stitch manages to escape from Gantu's ship, and Nani, horrified at Lilo's abduct, confronts Stitch. Before he can explain, Jumba and Pleakley capture Stitch themselves. Nani furiously demands that they help her rescue Lilo, but Jumba insists they only came for Stitch, causing her to break down. Stitch reminds Nani about {{okina}}[[ohana]], a term for \"family\" he learned from Lilo, and convinces Jumba to help rescue Lilo. Jumba, Pleakley, Stitch, and Nani all board Jumba's personal spaceship and chase after Gantu. After a lenghty battle, they rescue Lilo and destroy Gantu's ship.\n\nBack on the shore, the Grand Councilwoman arrives on Earth preparing to take Stitch into custody and is forced to retire Gantu for putting Lilo in danger and blames Jumba for the mess. However, Lilo insists that because Stitch is her pet under local law, he cannot be taken away. The Grand Councilwoman is so impressed with Stitch's newfound civility and empathy that she goes against the prior decision of the Federation and decrees that Stitch will live in a peaceful exile on Earth. He will be entrusted to the care of Lilo and Nani, and the Councilwoman asks Cobra, who is revealed to be a former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent that she previously met in 1973, to watch over them.\n\nLilo, Nani, and their newfound friends rebuild their house, and Jumba and Pleakley become members of Nani, Lilo, and Stitch's family, and they all build a new life together.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{Main|List of Lilo & Stitch characters}}\n* [[Chris Sanders]] as [[Stitch (Disney)|Experiment 626/Stitch]], a blue [[koala]]-like illegal [[genetic engineering|genetic experiment]] with the ability to create untold chaos.

[[Chris Sanders]], a head [[storyboard artist]] at Disney Feature Animation, was approached to pitch an idea. Sanders had created the character of Stitch in 1985 for an unsuccessful children's book pitch, and had to now develop a concept that featured the character in an animated film.<ref name=\"BTS\" /> The story line required a remote, non-urban location, so the movie was originally intended to take place in [[Kansas]].<ref name=\"DavisHanaHou\">{{Cite journal|url=http://www.hanahou.com/pages/magazine.asp?Action=DrawArticle&ArticleID=389&MagazineID=24 |title=Disney Goes Hawaiian |first=Pat |last=Davis |journal=[[Hana Hou!]] |volume=5 |issue=2 |date=April\u2013May 2002}}</ref> Sanders's decision to change the film's setting to the Hawaiian island of [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]] was an important choice in defining the plot more clearly.

But that choice went to color the entire movie, and rewrite the story for us.}}\n\n===Writing===\n[[Dean DeBlois]], who had co-written ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' (1998) with Chris Sanders, was brought on to co-write and co-direct ''Lilo & Stitch'', while Disney executive Clark Spencer was assigned to produce. Unlike several previous and concurrent Disney Feature Animation productions, the film's pre-production team remained relatively small and isolated from upper management until the film went into full production.<ref name=\"RM\">{{Cite news|last=Moore |first=Roger |coauthors= |title=Lilo & Stitch, Disney Feature Animation Florida's finest hour--remembered (originally published as \"For Disney's Orlando animators, it's show time!\" on 2002-06-16) |newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |location=[[Orlando, Florida]] |pages= |publisher=[[Tribune Media]] |date=2009-04-01 |url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_movies_blog/2009/04/lilo-stitch-disney-feature-animation-floridas-finest-hourremembered.html |accessdate= |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024025330/http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_movies_blog/2009/04/lilo-stitch-disney-feature-animation-floridas-finest-hourremembered.html |archivedate=2012-10-24}}</ref> The character and set designs were based upon Sanders's personal artistic style.<ref name=\"BTS\" />\n\nWhile the animation team visited [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]] to research the locale, their tour guide explained the meaning of ''[[ohana|{{okina}}ohana]]'' as it applies to [[Extended family|extended families]]. This concept of {{okina}}ohana became an important part of the movie. DeBlois recalls:\n\n{{quote|No matter where we went, our tour guide seemed to know somebody. He was really the one who explained to us the Hawaiian concept of {{okina}}ohana, a sense of family that extends far beyond your immediate relatives. That idea so influenced the story that it became the foundation theme, the thing that causes Stitch to evolve despite what he was created to do, which is destroy.}}\n\nThe island of Kaua{{okina}}i had also been featured in such films as ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', and those from the [[Jurassic Park (franchise)|''Jurassic Park'' trilogy]]. The Disney animators faced the daunting task of meshing the film's plot, which showed the impoverished and dysfunctional life that many Hawaiians lived during the then-recent [[Recession|economic downturn]], with the island's serene beauty. The actors voicing the film's young adults, Nani and David, were [[Tia Carrere]], a native of [[Honolulu]], and [[Jason Scott Lee]], who was raised in Hawaii. The voice actors assisted with rewriting the Hawaiian characters' dialogue in the proper [[Colloquialism|colloquial dialect]], and also with the task of adding Hawaiian slang terms.\n\nOne innovative and unique aspect of the film is its strong focus on the relationship between two sisters: Lilo and Nani. Making the relationship between sisters into a major plot element is very rare in [[American animation|American animated films]].<ref name=\"Solomon\">{{cite book|last=Solomon|first=Charles|title=The Art of Frozen|year=2013|publisher=Chronicle Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-1-4521-1716-4}}</ref>{{rp|13}}\n\n===Design and animation===\nIn a deviation from several decades' worth of Disney features, Sanders and DeBlois chose to use watercolor painted backgrounds for ''Lilo & Stitch'', as opposed to the traditional [[gouache]] technique.<ref name=\"BTS\" /> While watercolors had been used for the early Disney animated shorts, as well as the early Disney features ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937), ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (1940), and ''[[Dumbo]]'' (1941), the technique had been largely abandoned by the mid-1940s in favor of less complicated media such as [[gouache]]. Sanders preferred that watercolors be used for ''Lilo & Stitch'' to evoke both the bright look of a storybook and the art direction of ''Dumbo'', requiring the background artists to be trained in working with the medium.<ref name=\"BTS\" /> The character designs were based around Sanders's personal drawing style, eschewing the traditional Disney house style.<ref name=\"BTS\" /> The film's extraterrestrial elements, such as the spaceships, were designed to resemble marine life, such as whales and crabs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Elemental Magic: The Art of Special Effects Animation |first1=Joseph |last1=Gilland |year=2009 |publisher=Focal Press (Elsevier, Inc.) |isbn=978-0-240-81163-5 |page=256 }}</ref>\n\n===Marketing===\nTeaser [[Trailer (promotion)|trailers]] for the film parody trailers for other [[List of Walt Disney Pictures films|Disney films]] (three of which Sanders previously worked on) from the [[Disney Renaissance]]: ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]''  and ''[[The Lion King]]''. These are called \"Inter-Stitch-als\" and are featured on Disney's official site as well as on the film's respective DVD release. The original actors were brought back to reprise their roles and were shocked when asked to act negatively towards Stitch. The trailers also include the [[AC/DC]] song track \"[[Back in Black (song)|Back in Black]].\" In the United Kingdom, ''Lilo & Stitch'' trailers and TV ads featured a cover of Elvis' song \"[[Suspicious Minds]]\", performed by [[Gareth Gates]], who became famous on the UK TV program ''[[Pop Idol]]''. In the US, \"[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]\" was used for both theatrical and TV trailers. The marketing campaign presented Stitch as the sort of \"Disney Family [[Black sheep|Black Sheep]]\". As a promotional campaign, comics of ''Lilo & Stitch'' were run in ''[[Disney Adventures]] ''prior to the film's release. The comics detailed events leading up to the film for both title characters, including the creation and escape of Stitch. These events were later contradicted by the sequel ''[[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch]]'' rendering the comics non-canonical, but is notable to the series as introducing Experiment 625, [[Reuben (Lilo & Stitch)|Reuben]], who was made a main character in the subsequent movies and TV series. The comic series has been released as a collective volume titled ''Comic Zone Volume 1: Lilo & Stitch''.\n\n===Deleted scenes===\nSeveral major elements of the film changed during production. Originally, [[Stitch (Disney)|Stitch]] was the leader of an intergalactic gang, and [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] was one of his former cronies summoned by the Intergalactic Council to capture Stitch.<ref name=\"BTS\" /> Test audience response to early versions of the film resulted in the change of Stitch and Jumba's relationship to that of creation and creator, respectively.<ref name=\"BTS\" />\n\nThe biggest change came to the film's third act, which had Stitch, Nani, Jumba and Pleakley hijacking a [[Boeing 747]] jet from [[Lihue Airport]] and flying it through downtown [[Honolulu]] to save Lilo. Following the [[September 11 attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]], this sequence was revised so that Stitch instead flew a spaceship through the mountains of Kaua{{okina}}i. This revision was done primarily by replacing the [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] model of the 747 with that of Jumba's spaceship, with only a few shots in the sequence fully re-animated.<ref name=\"BTS\" />\n\nAnother scene that was deleted was one of Lilo's attempts to make Stitch into a model citizen by notifying tourists on the beach about the [[tsunami]] warning sirens, which she knows are being tested that day. The original version of Jumba attacking Stitch in Lilo's home was found to be too violent by test audiences, and was revised to make it more comedic. There was also a scene in which Lilo introduces Stitch to Pudge the fish, which ultimately leads to the fish's death. Lilo then takes Pudge's body to the same graveyard where her parents were buried, and thus Stitch learns the consequences of his actions and gains a better understanding of mortality.\n\nA scene was removed where Nani brings Lilo pizza and then Lilo tells herself a bedtime story about a friendly and stinky bear named Toaster. It was replaced with the scene where Lilo and Nani talk about being family because test audiences had mistaken Nani for Lilo's mother. The trial scene originally had Stitch as the defendant, and Jumba is not present. This was changed because of the film directors thought the Intergalactic Council had to blame him for creating Stitch.\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\n''Lilo & Stitch'' opened in second place with $35.3 million in its first weekend, less than $500,000 behind the film ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]''. In its second week it fell to third, again behind the [[Steven Spielberg]] film coming in second. The film earned $145.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $127.3 million internationally, totaling $273.1 million globally.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web|title=Lilo & Stitch|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=lilostitch.htm|accessdate=January 5, 2012}}</ref> [[Box Office Mojo]] estimates that the film sold over 25 million tickets during its original run.<ref name=\"mojo\" />\n\n===Critical reception===\n''Lilo & Stitch'' received largely positive reception. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that the film has an 86% \"Certified Fresh\" approval rating based on 145 reviews, with an average score of 7.3/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Edgier than traditional Disney fare, Lilo and Stitch explores issues of family while providing a fun and charming story.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lilo_and_stitch/|title=Lilo & Stitch (2002)|work=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> The film has also earned a score of 73 on [[Metacritic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/lilo-stitch|title=Lilo & Stitch|work=Metacritic|accessdate=January 7, 2012}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4 and wrote \"It's one of the most charming feature-length cartoons of recent years\u2014funny, sassy, startling, original and with six songs by Elvis\".<ref>http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/lilo-and-stitch-2002</ref> The film's success spawned a [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo & Stitch'' franchise]], with three sequel films and three television series.\n\nPeter M. Nichols states that through the character of [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]] and her struggles, the film appeals to older children better than such attempts by the studio to do so as ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'', ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', and ''[[Treasure Planet]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The New York Times Essential Library: Children's Movies|first1=Peter M.|last1=Nichols|year=2003|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|location=New York|isbn=0-8050-7198-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/childrensmoviesc00nich/page/152 152\u2013154]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/childrensmoviesc00nich/page/152}}</ref>\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was released on VHS and DVD on December 3, 2002. In 2003, a 2-disc [[DVD]] version was announced to come out along with [[Alice in Wonderland]]<nowiki/> and [[Pocahontas]], which were released in 2004 and 2005. A 2-Disc Special Edition DVD of Lilo & Stitch was released in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] on August 22, 2005, along with the UK release of [[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch]], but a release in the US was affected by many delays. On March 24, 2009, Disney finally released the special edition DVD, which is called a 2-Disc \"Big Wave Edition\".

The Movie]]'', which served as the pilot to a television series titled ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''. This series ran for 65 episodes between September 20, 2003 and July 29, 2006. The series carried on where the film left off and charted Lilo and Stitch's efforts to capture and rehabilitate Jumba's remaining experiments. The series, as well as the original parts of the franchise that focused on Lilo Pelekai and were set in Hawaii, ended with the television film ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]'', which aired on June 23, 2006.\n\nOn August 30, 2005, ''[[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch]]'', another direct-to-video sequel to the film, was released. In this film ([[Sequel#Interquel|set between]] ''Lilo & Stitch'' and ''Stitch! The Movie''), Stitch has a glitch because his molecules were never fully charged (this is contrary to an alternate opening, \"Stitch's trial\", which was seen on the DVD release of ''Lilo & Stitch''). Lilo wants to win the May Day hula contest like her mother did in the 1970s, but Stitch continues to have outbursts. Lilo gets increasingly mad at Stitch as his glitch causes more problems for her and ruins her chances of winning the competition. She thinks Stitch is not cooperating properly, until she finds out that Stitch is dying. The ''Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch'' DVD also contained a short film, ''[[The Origin of Stitch]]'', that served as a bridge between ''Stitch Has a Glitch'' and ''Stitch! The Movie''.\n\nIn March 2008, Disney announced an [[anime]] based on the ''Lilo & Stitch'' franchise aimed at the Japanese market titled ''[[Stitch!]]''. The anime, which ran as a series from October 2008 to March 2011, features a Japanese girl named Yuna Kamihara in place of Lilo, and is set on a fictional island in [[Okinawa Prefecture]] instead of Hawaii. This series was produced by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] for its first two seasons, and [[Shin-Ei Animation]] for its third season and two post-series specials in 2012 and 2015.\n\nIn March 2017, a third animated television series based on the franchise titled ''[[Stitch & Ai]]'' debuted in China. Like with the ''Stitch!'' anime, it features a local girl named Wang Ai Ling instead of Lilo, and is set in the [[Huangshan]] mountains. Unlike ''Stitch!'', however, this series was originally produced in English in co-operation with American animators (including those who worked on ''Lilo & Stitch: The Series'') and then dubbed into its local language. ''Stitch & Ai'' is produced by Anhui Xinhua Media and Panimation Hwakai Media.\n\n==Live-action adaptation==\nIn October 2018, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' announced that [[Walt Disney Pictures]] is developing a live-action remake of ''Lilo & Stitch''.

It was the second of three Disney animated features (the others being ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' and ''[[Brother Bear]]'') produced primarily at the Florida animation studio located at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] (known as \"Disney-MGM Studios\" during production) in [[Walt Disney World]] near [[Orlando, Florida]].<ref name=\"DisneyWar-Lilo\">{{cite book |last1=Stewart |first1=James B. |title=DisneyWar |date=2005 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=9780743283908 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/disneywar00jame_0/page/472 472]\u2013473 |language=en |quote=Weeks later, on January 12, Disney announced that it was shutting down its Orlando animation unit, where ''Lilo & Stitch'' had been created.|url=https://archive.org/details/disneywar00jame_0|url-access=registration }}</ref> It was released on June 21, 2002, to positive reviews and was nominated for the 2002 [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]]. That Academy Award was won by [[Studio Ghibli]]'s 2001 film ''[[Spirited Away]]'', which was also distributed in the United States by Walt Disney Pictures, and also starred Chase and Stiers in the English version.\n\nThe film's story revolves around two [[eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]] and [[mischief|mischievous]] individuals: a young Hawaiian girl named [[Lilo Pelekai]], who is raised by her older sister Nani after their parents died in a car accident, and a blue [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial animal-like creature]] named Experiment 626, who gets adopted by Lilo as her \"dog\" and is given the name \"Stitch\". Stitch, who is genetically engineered by his scientist creator to cause chaos and destruction, initially uses Lilo to avoid being captured by an intergalactic federation, but the two individuals develop a close bond through the Hawaiian concept of ''{{okina}}[[ohana]]'', or [[extended family]]. This bond causes Stitch to reconsider, and later defy, his intended destructive purpose in order to keep his family together.\n\nThe success of the film spawned a [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|franchise]]. A [[direct-to-video]] sequel called ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]'' was released on August 26, 2003. This was followed by a television series, ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]'', which ran from September 20, 2003, to July 29, 2006. A second direct-to-video sequel, ''[[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch]]'', was released on August 30, 2005. A third sequel, a [[television film]] titled ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]'', was released on June 23, 2006, as the conclusion to the TV series. An [[anime]] series that succeeded the original television series called ''[[Stitch!]]'' ran in Japan from October 8, 2008, to June 19, 2011, with [[Television special|TV specials]] broadcast in 2012 and 2015. A [[Chinese animated series]] succeeding the ''Stitch!'' anime, ''[[Stitch & Ai]]'', ran from March 27 to April 6, 2017.\n\nOther animation studios produced the sequel films and series: ''Stitch! The Movie'', ''Lilo & Stitch: The Series'', and ''Leroy & Stitch'' were all produced by [[Disney Television Animation|Walt Disney Television Animation]]; ''Stitch Has a Glitch'' was produced by [[Disneytoon Studios]]; ''Stitch!'' was produced by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] for its first two seasons, and then [[Shin-Ei Animation]] for its third season (and two post-series specials); and ''Stitch & Ai'' was produced by Anhui Xinhua Media and Panimation Hwakai Media.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per WP:MOSFILM, plot summaries should be in the range of 400-700 words. Please do not add more detail, but adjust what is already present. -->\nIn the deep reaches of space, Dr. Jumba Jookiba, an extraterrestrial [[mad scientist]], is arrested and put on trial by the Galactic Federation for illegal genetic experimentation, as evidenced by his creation \"Experiment 626\", a small blue sentient alien with unparalleled intelligence and strength, but also a propensity to cause chaos. Jumba is imprisoned while the alien is sentenced to exile on a desert asteroid. 626 manages to escape on a red police spaceship, and activates the hyperdrive, causing its guidance systems to malfunction and randomly set a course for Earth. 626 crash-lands on [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i, Hawaii]], only to be knocked unconscious by three passing trucks and taken to an [[animal shelter]]. The Grand Councilwoman dispatches Jumba and Agent Pleakley, the Council's Earth expert, to the planet to have 626 captured as discreetly as possible, as Earth is the habitat for the supposedly \"endangered\" mosquito population, and humans are described as being unable to handle an alien encounter formally.\n\nOn Kaua{{okina}}i, a young woman named Nani Pelekai is having trouble caring for her rambunctious, disobedient, and lonely younger sister, Lilo, following the death of their parents. A social worker named Cobra Bubbles expresses increasing concern whether Nani is able to take adequate care of her sister. Since Lilo has been ostracized by her hula classmates, Nani decides to let her adopt a dog. At the shelter, Lilo immediately takes a keen interest in 626, who is impersonating a dog. In spite of Nani's doubts, Lilo calls 626 \"[[Stitch (Disney)|Stitch]]\", and shows him around the island.\n\nThat evening, at the restaurant where Nani works, the aliens Jumba and Pleakley try, but fail every time, to capture Stitch. The indescribable chaos is blamed on Stitch, which results in Nani getting fired. The next day, Cobra warns her that unless she finds another job, he will have to place Lilo with a foster family. However, Stitch's antics, which occur in the course of his evasion of his two pursuers, persistently ruin Nani's chances of finding work.\n\nNani's friend David invites her, Lilo, and Stitch to enjoy a day of surfing. While Nani, Lilo, and Stitch ride a huge wave, Jumba makes one final effort to capture Stitch from underwater, causing Stitch to unintentionally pull Lilo underwater. They survive, but Cobra witnesses this event and tells Nani that, although she means well, Lilo has to be taken away unless Nani finds another job. Seeing how much trouble he has caused, Stitch runs off into the night.\n\nThe next morning, the Councilwoman fires Jumba and Pleakley from their assignment and gives it to the galaxy's oversized militant captain, Captain Gantu (incidentally freeing Jumba to pursue Stitch using less covert methods). Meanwhile, David informs Nani of a job opportunity, which she excitedly rushes off to pursue. Stitch, hiding in the nearby woods, encounters Jumba, who chases him back to Nani's house. A fight ensues which destroys the house; Cobra arrives to collect Lilo and take her away.\n\nAs Nani and Cobra argue, Lilo runs away into the woods and finds Stitch, who reveals his alien identity just before they are captured by Gantu. Stitch manages to escape from Gantu's ship and is confronted by Nani. Before he can explain, Jumba and Pleakley capture Stitch themselves. Nani demands that they help her rescue Lilo, but Jumba insists they only came for Stitch. When Nani breaks down, Stitch reminds her about {{okina}}[[ohana]], a term for \"family\" he learned from Lilo, and convinces Jumba to help rescue Lilo. Jumba, Pleakley, Stitch, and Nani all board Jumba's personal spaceship and chase after Gantu, rescuing Lilo.\n\nBack on the shore, the Grand Councilwoman arrives on Earth preparing to take Stitch into custody and is forced to retire Gantu for putting Lilo in danger and blames Jumba for the mess. However, Lilo insists that because Stitch is her pet under local law, he cannot be taken away. The Grand Councilwoman is so impressed with Stitch's newfound civility and empathy that she goes against the prior decision of the Federation and decrees that Stitch will live in a peaceful exile on Earth. He will be entrusted to the care of Lilo and Nani, and the Councilwoman asks Cobra, who is revealed to be a former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent that she previously met in 1973, to watch over them.\n\nLilo, Nani, and their newfound friends rebuild their house, and Jumba and Pleakley become members of Nani, Lilo, and Stitch's family, and they all build a new life together.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{Main|List of Lilo & Stitch characters}}\n* [[Chris Sanders]] as [[Stitch (Disney)|Experiment 626/Stitch]], a blue [[koala]]-like illegal [[genetic engineering|genetic experiment]] with the ability to create untold chaos.

[[Chris Sanders]], a head [[storyboard artist]] at Disney Feature Animation, was approached to pitch an idea. Sanders had created the character of Stitch in 1985 for an unsuccessful children's book pitch, and had to now develop a concept that featured the character in an animated film.<ref name=\"BTS\" /> The story line required a remote, non-urban location, so the movie was originally intended to take place in [[Kansas]].<ref name=\"DavisHanaHou\">{{Cite journal|url=http://www.hanahou.com/pages/magazine.asp?Action=DrawArticle&ArticleID=389&MagazineID=24 |title=Disney Goes Hawaiian |first=Pat |last=Davis |journal=[[Hana Hou!]] |volume=5 |issue=2 |date=April\u2013May 2002}}</ref> Sanders's decision to change the film's setting to the Hawaiian island of [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]] was an important choice in defining the plot more clearly.

But that choice went to color the entire movie, and rewrite the story for us.}}\n\n===Writing===\n[[Dean DeBlois]], who had co-written ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' (1998) with Chris Sanders, was brought on to co-write and co-direct ''Lilo & Stitch'', while Disney executive Clark Spencer was assigned to produce. Unlike several previous and concurrent Disney Feature Animation productions, the film's pre-production team remained relatively small and isolated from upper management until the film went into full production.<ref name=\"RM\">{{Cite news|last=Moore |first=Roger |coauthors= |title=Lilo & Stitch, Disney Feature Animation Florida's finest hour--remembered (originally published as \"For Disney's Orlando animators, it's show time!\" on 2002-06-16) |newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |location=[[Orlando, Florida]] |pages= |publisher=[[Tribune Media]] |date=2009-04-01 |url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_movies_blog/2009/04/lilo-stitch-disney-feature-animation-floridas-finest-hourremembered.html |accessdate= |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024025330/http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_movies_blog/2009/04/lilo-stitch-disney-feature-animation-floridas-finest-hourremembered.html |archivedate=2012-10-24}}</ref> The character and set designs were based upon Sanders's personal artistic style.<ref name=\"BTS\" />\n\nWhile the animation team visited [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]] to research the locale, their tour guide explained the meaning of ''[[ohana|{{okina}}ohana]]'' as it applies to [[Extended family|extended families]]. This concept of {{okina}}ohana became an important part of the movie. DeBlois recalls:\n\n{{quote|No matter where we went, our tour guide seemed to know somebody. He was really the one who explained to us the Hawaiian concept of {{okina}}ohana, a sense of family that extends far beyond your immediate relatives. That idea so influenced the story that it became the foundation theme, the thing that causes Stitch to evolve despite what he was created to do, which is destroy.}}\n\nThe island of Kaua{{okina}}i had also been featured in such films as ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', and those from the [[Jurassic Park (franchise)|''Jurassic Park'' trilogy]]. The Disney animators faced the daunting task of meshing the film's plot, which showed the impoverished and dysfunctional life that many Hawaiians lived during the then-recent [[Recession|economic downturn]], with the island's serene beauty. The actors voicing the film's young adults, Nani and David, were [[Tia Carrere]], a native of [[Honolulu]], and [[Jason Scott Lee]], who was raised in Hawaii. The voice actors assisted with rewriting the Hawaiian characters' dialogue in the proper [[Colloquialism|colloquial dialect]], and also with the task of adding Hawaiian slang terms.\n\nOne innovative and unique aspect of the film is its strong focus on the relationship between two sisters: Lilo and Nani. Making the relationship between sisters into a major plot element is very rare in [[American animation|American animated films]].<ref name=\"Solomon\">{{cite book|last=Solomon|first=Charles|title=The Art of Frozen|year=2013|publisher=Chronicle Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-1-4521-1716-4}}</ref>{{rp|13}}\n\n===Design and animation===\nIn a deviation from several decades' worth of Disney features, Sanders and DeBlois chose to use watercolor painted backgrounds for ''Lilo & Stitch'', as opposed to the traditional [[gouache]] technique.<ref name=\"BTS\" /> While watercolors had been used for the early Disney animated shorts, as well as the early Disney features ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937), ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (1940), and ''[[Dumbo]]'' (1941), the technique had been largely abandoned by the mid-1940s in favor of less complicated media such as [[gouache]]. Sanders preferred that watercolors be used for ''Lilo & Stitch'' to evoke both the bright look of a storybook and the art direction of ''Dumbo'', requiring the background artists to be trained in working with the medium.<ref name=\"BTS\" /> The character designs were based around Sanders's personal drawing style, eschewing the traditional Disney house style.<ref name=\"BTS\" /> The film's extraterrestrial elements, such as the spaceships, were designed to resemble marine life, such as whales and crabs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Elemental Magic: The Art of Special Effects Animation |first1=Joseph |last1=Gilland |year=2009 |publisher=Focal Press (Elsevier, Inc.) |isbn=978-0-240-81163-5 |page=256 }}</ref>\n\n===Marketing===\nTeaser [[Trailer (promotion)|trailers]] for the film parody trailers for other [[List of Walt Disney Pictures films|Disney films]] (three of which Sanders previously worked on) from the [[Disney Renaissance]]: ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]''  and ''[[The Lion King]]''. These are called \"Inter-Stitch-als\" and are featured on Disney's official site as well as on the film's respective DVD release. The original actors were brought back to reprise their roles and were shocked when asked to act negatively towards Stitch. The trailers also include the [[AC/DC]] song track \"[[Back in Black (song)|Back in Black]].\" In the United Kingdom, ''Lilo & Stitch'' trailers and TV ads featured a cover of Elvis' song \"[[Suspicious Minds]]\", performed by [[Gareth Gates]], who became famous on the UK TV program ''[[Pop Idol]]''. In the US, \"[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]\" was used for both theatrical and TV trailers. The marketing campaign presented Stitch as the sort of \"Disney Family [[Black sheep|Black Sheep]]\". As a promotional campaign, comics of ''Lilo & Stitch'' were run in ''[[Disney Adventures]] ''prior to the film's release. The comics detailed events leading up to the film for both title characters, including the creation and escape of Stitch. These events were later contradicted by the sequel ''[[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch]]'' rendering the comics non-canonical, but is notable to the series as introducing Experiment 625, [[Reuben (Lilo & Stitch)|Reuben]], who was made a main character in the subsequent movies and TV series. The comic series has been released as a collective volume titled ''Comic Zone Volume 1: Lilo & Stitch''.\n\n===Deleted scenes===\nSeveral major elements of the film changed during production. Originally, [[Stitch (Disney)|Stitch]] was the leader of an intergalactic gang, and [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] was one of his former cronies summoned by the Intergalactic Council to capture Stitch.<ref name=\"BTS\" /> Test audience response to early versions of the film resulted in the change of Stitch and Jumba's relationship to that of creation and creator, respectively.<ref name=\"BTS\" />\n\nThe biggest change came to the film's third act, which had Stitch, Nani, Jumba and Pleakley hijacking a [[Boeing 747]] jet from [[Lihue Airport]] and flying it through downtown [[Honolulu]] to save Lilo. Following the [[September 11 attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]], this sequence was revised so that Stitch instead flew a spaceship through the mountains of Kaua{{okina}}i. This revision was done primarily by replacing the [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] model of the 747 with that of Jumba's spaceship, with only a few shots in the sequence fully re-animated.<ref name=\"BTS\" />\n\nAnother scene that was deleted was one of Lilo's attempts to make Stitch into a model citizen by notifying tourists on the beach about the [[tsunami]] warning sirens, which she knows are being tested that day. The original version of Jumba attacking Stitch in Lilo's home was found to be too violent by test audiences, and was revised to make it more comedic. There was also a scene in which Lilo introduces Stitch to Pudge the fish, which ultimately leads to the fish's death. Lilo then takes Pudge's body to the same graveyard where her parents were buried, and thus Stitch learns the consequences of his actions and gains a better understanding of mortality.\n\nA scene was removed where Nani brings Lilo pizza and then Lilo tells herself a bedtime story about a friendly and stinky bear named Toaster. It was replaced with the scene where Lilo and Nani talk about being family because test audiences had mistaken Nani for Lilo's mother. The trial scene originally had Stitch as the defendant, and Jumba is not present. This was changed because of the film directors thought the Intergalactic Council had to blame him for creating Stitch.\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\n''Lilo & Stitch'' opened in second place with $35.3 million in its first weekend, less than $500,000 behind the film ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]''. In its second week it fell to third, again behind the [[Steven Spielberg]] film coming in second. The film earned $145.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $127.3 million internationally, totaling $273.1 million globally.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web|title=Lilo & Stitch|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=lilostitch.htm|accessdate=January 5, 2012}}</ref> [[Box Office Mojo]] estimates that the film sold over 25 million tickets during its original run.<ref name=\"mojo\" />\n\n===Critical reception===\n''Lilo & Stitch'' received largely positive reception. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that the film has an 86% \"Certified Fresh\" approval rating based on 145 reviews, with an average score of 7.3/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Edgier than traditional Disney fare, Lilo and Stitch explores issues of family while providing a fun and charming story.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lilo_and_stitch/|title=Lilo & Stitch (2002)|work=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> The film has also earned a score of 73 on [[Metacritic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/lilo-stitch|title=Lilo & Stitch|work=Metacritic|accessdate=January 7, 2012}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4 and wrote \"It's one of the most charming feature-length cartoons of recent years\u2014funny, sassy, startling, original and with six songs by Elvis\".<ref>http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/lilo-and-stitch-2002</ref> The film's success spawned a [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo & Stitch'' franchise]], with three sequel films and three television series.\n\nPeter M. Nichols states that through the character of [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]] and her struggles, the film appeals to older children better than such attempts by the studio to do so as ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'', ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', and ''[[Treasure Planet]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The New York Times Essential Library: Children's Movies|first1=Peter M.|last1=Nichols|year=2003|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|location=New York|isbn=0-8050-7198-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/childrensmoviesc00nich/page/152 152\u2013154]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/childrensmoviesc00nich/page/152}}</ref>\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was released on VHS and DVD on December 3, 2002. In 2003, a 2-disc [[DVD]] version was announced to come out along with [[Alice in Wonderland]]<nowiki/> and [[Pocahontas]], which were released in 2004 and 2005. A 2-Disc Special Edition DVD of Lilo & Stitch was released in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] on August 22, 2005, along with the UK release of [[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch]], but a release in the US was affected by many delays. On March 24, 2009, Disney finally released the special edition DVD, which is called a 2-Disc \"Big Wave Edition\". This new DVD has everything that the original DVD had and adds an audio commentary, a 2-hour documentary, more deleted scenes, a number of behind-the-scenes featurettes, and some games.\n\n====Altered scene====\nA scene was modified for the UK home video release.<ref>https://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=4868</ref>  In the original, Lilo hid in a clothes dryer, which was changed to a commode to avoid influencing children to hide in dryers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Holmes |first1=Adam |title=Yes, Disney Apparently Edited A Lilo And Stitch Scene, And Fans Are Freaking |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2493332/yes-disney-apparently-edited-a-lilo-and-stitch-scene-and-fans-are-freaking |website=CinemaBlend |accessdate=26 March 2020 |date=25 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Lilo & Stitch: An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = Various artists\n<!-- Commented out: | cover      = Lilo & Stitch Soundtrack.jpg -->\n| caption    = {{deletable image-caption|Friday, 15 February 2019|PROD}}\n| alt        =\n| released   = June 11, 2002\n| recorded   = 2001-2002\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Rock music|Rock]], [[country rock]], [[Pop music|pop]]\n| length     = 34:47\n| label      = [[Walt Disney Records|Walt Disney]]\n| producer   = Chris Montan <small>(executive)</small>\n| chronology = ''[[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|Lilo & Stitch]]'' music\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title = [[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch#Soundtrack|Lilo & Stitch 2: Island Favorites]]\n| next_year  = 2005\n| misc       = {{Extra chronology\n | artist     = [[Walt Disney Records discography|Walt Disney Animation Studios]]\n | type       = soundtrack\n | prev_title = [[Atlantis: The Lost Empire (soundtrack)|Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]\n | prev_year  = 2001\n | title      = Lilo & Stitch: An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack\n | year       = 2002\n | next_title = [[Treasure Planet]]\n | next_year  = 2002\n}}{{Singles\n | name        = Lilo & Stitch\n | type        = soundtrack\n | single1     = [[Can't Help Falling in Love#A-Teens version|Can't Help Falling in Love]]\n | single1date = October 29, 2002\n}}\n}}\n\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r592478}}</ref>\n}}\n\n'''''Lilo & Stitch: An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack''''' is the soundtrack to [[Disney]]'s 2002 animated feature ''Lilo & Stitch''.

The Movie]]'', which served as the pilot to a television series titled ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''. This series ran for 65 episodes between September 20, 2003 and July 29, 2006. The series carried on where the film left off and charted Lilo and Stitch's efforts to capture and rehabilitate Jumba's remaining experiments. The series, as well as the original parts of the franchise that focused on Lilo Pelekai and were set in Hawaii, ended with the television film ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]'', which aired on June 23, 2006.\n\nOn August 30, 2005, ''[[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch]]'', another direct-to-video sequel to the film, was released. In this film ([[Sequel#Interquel|set between]] ''Lilo & Stitch'' and ''Stitch! The Movie''), Stitch has a glitch because his molecules were never fully charged (this is contrary to an alternate opening, \"Stitch's trial\", which was seen on the DVD release of ''Lilo & Stitch''). Lilo wants to win the May Day hula contest like her mother did in the 1970s, but Stitch continues to have outbursts. Lilo gets increasingly mad at Stitch as his glitch causes more problems for her and ruins her chances of winning the competition. She thinks Stitch is not cooperating properly, until she finds out that Stitch is dying. The ''Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch'' DVD also contained a short film, ''[[The Origin of Stitch]]'', that served as a bridge between ''Stitch Has a Glitch'' and ''Stitch! The Movie''.\n\nIn March 2008, Disney announced an [[anime]] based on the ''Lilo & Stitch'' franchise aimed at the Japanese market titled ''[[Stitch!]]''. The anime, which ran as a series from October 2008 to March 2011, features a Japanese girl named Yuna Kamihara in place of Lilo, and is set on a fictional island in [[Okinawa Prefecture]] instead of Hawaii. This series was produced by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] for its first two seasons, and [[Shin-Ei Animation]] for its third season and two post-series specials in 2012 and 2015.\n\nIn March 2017, a third animated television series based on the franchise titled ''[[Stitch & Ai]]'' debuted in China. Like with the ''Stitch!'' anime, it features a local girl named Wang Ai Ling instead of Lilo, and is set in the [[Huangshan]] mountains. Unlike ''Stitch!'', however, this series was originally produced in English in co-operation with American animators (including those who worked on ''Lilo & Stitch: The Series'') and then dubbed into its local language. ''Stitch & Ai'' is produced by Anhui Xinhua Media and Panimation Hwakai Media.\n\n==Live-action adaptation==\nIn October 2018, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' announced that [[Walt Disney Pictures]] is developing a live-action remake of ''Lilo & Stitch''. It was also announced that the film will be produced by ''[[Aladdin (2019 film)|Aladdin]]'' producers [[Dan Lin]] and Jonathan Eirich and written by Mike Van Waes.<ref name=\"live-action-thr\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lilo-stitch-live-action-disney-remake-works-1148811?|title='Lilo & Stitch' Live-Action Remake in the Works at Disney (Exclusive)|last=Kit|first=Borys|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=2018-10-03|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en|df=mdy-all}}</ref> On February 4, 2020, it was reported that the remake will be released on Disney's streaming service, [[Disney+]],<ref name=\"Disney+\">{{Cite news|url=https://thedisinsider.com/2020/02/04/exclusive-lilo-stitch-disney/|title=Exclusive: Disney\u2019s Live-Action \u2018Lilo & Stitch\u2019 Will Head To Disney+|last=Shuler|first=Skyler|work=The DisInsider|date=February 4, 2020|language=en|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and that [[Chris Sanders]] will reprise his role as the voice of Stitch.

Stitch is also a summonable character in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts III|III]]'', and appears along with his homeworld in ''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]'' for the [[PlayStation Portable]]. Lilo and Stitch both appear in the [[Nintendo 3DS]] game ''[[Disney Magical World]]'' and [[Disney Magical World 2|its sequel]]. Stitch is also a playable character in the [[Disney Infinity (series)|''Disney Infinity'' series]] in the second game, ''[[Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes]]'', and the series' third and final game, ''[[Disney Infinity 3.0]]''. He was also a meet and greet character in ''[[Kinect: Disneyland Adventures]]''.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Disney|Film|Animation|Cartoon}}\n* [[List of films featuring extraterrestrials]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Lilo & Stitch}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{Official website|http://movies.disney.com/lilo-stitch}}<!--Older official site: http://disney.go.com/disneyvideos/animatedfilms/liloandstitch/index.html , archived at the wayback machine -->\n* {{Amg movie|262609}}\n* {{bcdb|23323-Lilo_amp_Stitch}}\n* {{IMDb title|0275847}}\n* {{mojo title|lilostitch}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|lilo_and_stitch}}\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n{{Chris Sanders}}\n{{Dean DeBlois}}\n{{Disney theatrical animated features}}\n{{Walt Disney Animation Studios}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lilo and Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch| ]]\n[[Category:2002 animated films]]\n[[Category:2002 films]]\n[[Category:2000s American animated films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:2000s comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:American animated science fiction films]]\n[[Category:American buddy films]]\n[[Category:American children's animated comedy films]]\n[[Category:American comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:Animated buddy films]]\n[[Category:Animated comedy films]]\n[[Category:Animated films about orphans]]\n[[Category:Animated films about extraterrestrial life]]\n[[Category:Annie Award winners]]\n[[Category:Directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:Films about children]]\n[[Category:Films about dysfunctional families]]\n[[Category:Films about families]]\n[[Category:Films about sisters]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into comics]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into television programs]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into video games]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Chris Sanders]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Dean DeBlois]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Alan Silvestri]]\n[[Category:Films set in Hawaii]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Chris Sanders]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Dean DeBlois]]\n[[Category:Surfing films]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Animation Studios films]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Pictures films]]\n[[Category:2000s children's animated films]]\n", "name_user": "87.6.43.122", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200ePlot)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilo_%26_Stitch"}

Data from the 1957-1958 season were derived from games involving [[Sheffield Wednesday]]. Data from the 1961-1962 season were derived from games involving [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. The second set of data comprised an additional 477 games. Data from both sets of game data (578 games) were used in the paper to analyse passing move distributions.

Wilson points out that Reep's analysis shows that 91.5% of moves in the games he studied had 3 passes or fewer and that logically, this would mean that 91.5% of all goals should come from moves with 3 passes or fewer. However, Reep's analysis found that fewer than 80% of goals came from moves with 3 passes or fewer.<ref name=invertingpyramid/> Therefore, Reep's own work shows that moves with 3 passes or fewer are less effective than those with 4 or more. \"And these figures do not even take into account the goals scored when long chains of passes have led to a dead-ball or a breakdown or even the fact that a side holding possession and making their opponents chase is likely to tire less quickly, and so will be able to pick off exhausted opponents late on. It is, frankly, horrifying that a philosophy founded on such a basic misinterpretation of figures could have been allowed to become a cornerstone of English coaching. Anti-intellectualism is one thing, but faith in wrong-headed pseudo-intellectualism is far worse.\"<ref name=invertingpyramid/> \n\nWilson also points out that in World Cup matches Reep observed, the percentage of all moves comprising seven or more passes was roughly double what it was for English league games in the preceding season. \"If long, direct play really were superior, surely there would be more of it the higher the level?... Tactics must be conditioned by circumstances and the players available. Reep's apologists misinterpret the figures, but even if they had not, his method is so general as to be all but meaningless. Why would it follow that an approach suited to a Third Division match in Rotherham in December would be equally applicable to a World Cup game in Guadalajara in July?\"<ref name=invertingpyramid/>\n\nRichard Pollard (2019)<ref>Pollard, R (2019) Invalid Interpretation of Passing Sequence Data to Assess Team Performance in Football: Repairing the Tarnished Legacy of Charles Reep , The Open Sports Sciences Journal, 12, pp. 17-21</ref> addressed these criticisms. Pollard argued that \"passing sequence data cannot be used to give information about the relative merits of direct and possession play\". His paper provided an alternative reading of Reep's work and challenged accepted wisdom about Reep.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Cornwall}}\n*[[Association football]]\n*[[Charles Hughes (football coach)]]\n*[[Long ball]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/sas/2001/00000002/00000003/art00005 Charles Reep: A Major Influence on British and Norwegian Football]\n*[http://keithlyons.me/goal-scoring-in-association-football-charles-reep/ Goal Scoring in Association Football: Charles Reep]\n*[http://keithlyons.me/charles-reep-and-brentford/ Charles Reep and Brentford]\n\n==Further reading==\n*Reep, C (1989) Analysis of Scottish Soccer.

Wilson points out that Reep's analysis shows that 91.5% of moves in the games he studied had 3 passes or fewer and that logically, this would mean that 91.5% of all goals should come from moves with 3 passes or fewer. However, Reep's analysis found that fewer than 80% of goals came from moves with 3 passes or fewer.<ref name=invertingpyramid/> Therefore, Reep's own work shows that moves with 3 passes or fewer are less effective than those with 4 or more. \"And these figures do not even take into account the goals scored when long chains of passes have led to a dead-ball or a breakdown or even the fact that a side holding possession and making their opponents chase is likely to tire less quickly, and so will be able to pick off exhausted opponents late on. It is, frankly, horrifying that a philosophy founded on such a basic misinterpretation of figures could have been allowed to become a cornerstone of English coaching. Anti-intellectualism is one thing, but faith in wrong-headed pseudo-intellectualism is far worse.\"<ref name=invertingpyramid/> \n\nWilson also points out that in World Cup matches Reep observed, the percentage of all moves comprising seven or more passes was roughly double what it was for English league games in the preceding season. \"If long, direct play really were superior, surely there would be more of it the higher the level?... Tactics must be conditioned by circumstances and the players available. Reep's apologists misinterpret the figures, but even if they had not, his method is so general as to be all but meaningless. Why would it follow that an approach suited to a Third Division match in Rotherham in December would be equally applicable to a World Cup game in Guadalajara in July?\"<ref name=invertingpyramid/>\n\nRichard Pollard (2019)<ref>Pollard, R (2019) Invalid Interpretation of Passing Sequence Data to Assess Team Performance in Football: Repairing the Tarnished Legacy of Charles Reep , The Open Sports Sciences Journal, 12, pp. 17-21</ref> addressed these criticisms. Pollard argued that \"passing sequence data cannot be used to give information about the relative merits of direct and possession play\". His paper provided an alternative reading of Reep's work and challenged accepted wisdom about Reep.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Association football]]\n*[[Charles Hughes (football coach)]]\n*[[Long ball]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/sas/2001/00000002/00000003/art00005 Charles Reep: A Major Influence on British and Norwegian Football]\n*[http://keithlyons.me/goal-scoring-in-association-football-charles-reep/ Goal Scoring in Association Football: Charles Reep]\n*[http://keithlyons.me/charles-reep-and-brentford/ Charles Reep and Brentford]\n\n==Further reading==\n*Reep, C (1989) Analysis of Scottish Soccer.

{"title_page": "Recursive acronym", "text_new": "{{short description|Acronym whose expansion includes a copy of itself}}\nA '''recursive acronym''' is an [[acronym]] that [[recursion|refers to itself]]. The term was first used in print in 1979 in [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s book ''[[G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach|G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]]'', in which Hofstadter invents the acronym GOD, meaning \"GOD Over Djinn\", to help explain infinite series, and describes it as a recursive acronym.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.math.cornell.edu/~mec/Summer2009/ABjorndahl/extension.html |title = Puzzles and Paradoxes: Infinity in Finite Terms |accessdate=2013-04-23 }}</ref> Other references followed,<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.wordspy.com/words/recursiveacronym.asp |title = WordSpy \u2013 Recursive Acronym |accessdate=2008-12-18 }}</ref> however the concept was used as early as 1968 in [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]]'s science fiction novel ''[[Stand on Zanzibar]]''. In the story, the acronym EPT (Education for Particular Task) later morphed into \"Eptification for Particular Task\".\n\nRecursive acronyms typically form [[Backronym|backwardly]]: either an existing ordinary acronym is given a new explanation of what the letters stand for, or a name is turned into an acronym by giving the letters an explanation of what they stand for, in each case with the first letter standing recursively for the whole acronym.\n\n==Early computer-related examples==\nIn [[computing]], an early tradition in the [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hacker]] community (especially at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]) was to choose acronyms and abbreviations that referred humorously to themselves or to other abbreviations. Perhaps the earliest example in this context \u2013 from 1960 \u2013 is the [[backronym]] \"Mash Until No Good\", which was created to describe [[Mung (computer term)|Mung]], and a while later was revised to \"Mung Until No Good\". It lived on as a recursive command in the editing language [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]].<sup>[[Mung (computer term)|[3]]]</sup> In 1977 or 1978 came TINT (\"TINT Is Not [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]]\"), an editor for [[MagicSix]] written (and named) by Ted Anderson. This inspired the two MIT [[Lisp Machine]] editors called [[EINE]] (\"EINE Is Not [[Emacs]]\", German for ''one'') and [[ZWEI]] (\"ZWEI Was EINE Initially\", German for ''two''). These were followed by [[Richard Stallman]]'s [[GNU]] (GNU's Not [[Unix]]). Many others also include negatives, such as denials that the thing defined is or resembles something else (which the thing defined does in fact resemble or is even derived from), to indicate that, despite the similarities, it was distinct from the program on which it was based.<ref>[http://fsfe.org/freesoftware/transcripts/rms-fs-2006-03-09.en.html#the-name-gnu The Free Software Movement and the Future of Freedom: The name \"GNU\"], Richard Stallman, March 9th 2006</ref>\n\nAn earlier example appears in a 1976 textbook on data structures, in which the pseudo-language SPARKS is used to define the algorithms discussed in the text. \"SPARKS\" is claimed to be a non-acronymic name, but \"several cute ideas have been suggested\" as expansions of the name.

The term was first used in print in 1979 in [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s book ''[[G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach|G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]]'', in which Hofstadter invents the acronym GOD, meaning \"GOD Over Djinn\", to help explain infinite series, and describes it as a recursive acronym.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.math.cornell.edu/~mec/Summer2009/ABjorndahl/extension.html |title = Puzzles and Paradoxes: Infinity in Finite Terms |accessdate=2013-04-23 }}</ref> Other references followed,<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.wordspy.com/words/recursiveacronym.asp |title = WordSpy \u2013 Recursive Acronym |accessdate=2008-12-18 }}</ref> however the concept was used as early as 1968 in [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]]'s science fiction novel ''[[Stand on Zanzibar]]''. In the story, the acronym EPT (Education for Particular Task) later morphed into \"Eptification for Particular Task\".\n\nRecursive acronyms typically form [[Backronym|backwardly]]: either an existing ordinary acronym is given a new explanation of what the letters stand for, or a name is turned into an acronym by giving the letters an explanation of what they stand for, in each case with the first letter standing recursively for the whole acronym.\n\n==Early computer-related examples==\nIn [[computing]], an early tradition in the [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hacker]] community (especially at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]) was to choose acronyms and abbreviations that referred humorously to themselves or to other abbreviations. Perhaps the earliest example in this context \u2013 from 1960 \u2013 is the [[backronym]] \"Mash Until No Good\", which was created to describe [[Mung (computer term)|Mung]], and a while later was revised to \"Mung Until No Good\". It lived on as a recursive command in the editing language [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]].<sup>[[Mung (computer term)|[3]]]</sup> In 1977 or 1978 came TINT (\"TINT Is Not [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]]\"), an editor for [[MagicSix]] written (and named) by Ted Anderson. This inspired the two MIT [[Lisp Machine]] editors called [[EINE]] (\"EINE Is Not [[Emacs]]\", German for ''one'') and [[ZWEI]] (\"ZWEI Was EINE Initially\", German for ''two''). These were followed by [[Richard Stallman]]'s [[GNU]] (GNU's Not [[Unix]]). Many others also include negatives, such as denials that the thing defined is or resembles something else (which the thing defined does in fact resemble or is even derived from), to indicate that, despite the similarities, it was distinct from the program on which it was based.<ref>[http://fsfe.org/freesoftware/transcripts/rms-fs-2006-03-09.en.html#the-name-gnu The Free Software Movement and the Future of Freedom: The name \"GNU\"], Richard Stallman, March 9th 2006</ref>\n\nAn earlier example appears in a 1976 textbook on data structures, in which the pseudo-language SPARKS is used to define the algorithms discussed in the text. \"SPARKS\" is claimed to be a non-acronymic name, but \"several cute ideas have been suggested\" as expansions of the name.

Soon thereafter, suspecting treachery on the part of their hosts, the Spaniards took [[Moctezuma II]], the king or [[Hueyi Tlatoani]] of the [[Mexica]], hostage. Though Moctezuma followed Cort\u00e9s' instructions in continually assuring his subjects that he had been ordered by the gods to move in with the Spaniards and that he had done so willingly, the Aztecs suspected otherwise. During the following 98 days, Cort\u00e9s and his native allies, the [[Tlaxcaltecas]], were increasingly unwelcome guests in the capital.\n\n===Cort\u00e9s heads off Spanish punitive expedition===\nIn June 1520, news from the [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf coast]] reached Cort\u00e9s that a much larger party of Spaniards had been sent by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar|Governor Vel\u00e1zquez]] of Cuba to arrest Cort\u00e9s for insubordination. Leaving Tenochtitlan in the care of his trusted lieutenant, [[Pedro de Alvarado]], Cort\u00e9s marched to the coast, where he defeated the Cuban expedition led by [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]] sent to capture him. When Cort\u00e9s told the defeated soldiers about the riches of Tenochtitlan, they agreed to join him. Reinforced by Narvaez's men, Cort\u00e9s headed back to Tenochtitlan.\n\n===Loss of control in Tenochtitlan===\nDuring Cort\u00e9s' absence, Pedro de Alvarado in Tenochtitlan obtained information that the Aztecs were planning to attack him. In response, de Alvarado ordered a [[Massacre in the Great Temple|preemptive slaughter of Aztec nobles and priests celebrating a festival in the city's main temple]]. In retaliation, the Aztecs laid siege to the Spanish compound, in which Moctezuma was still being held captive. By the time Cort\u00e9s returned to Tenochtitlan in late June, the Aztecs had elected a new Hueyi Tlatoani named [[Cuitl\u00e1huac]].\n\nCort\u00e9s ordered Moctezuma to address his people from a terrace in order to persuade them to stop fighting and to allow the Spaniards to leave the city in peace. The Aztecs, however, jeered at Moctezuma, and pelted him with stones and darts. By Spanish accounts, he was killed in this assault by the Mexica people, though they claim he had been killed instead by the Spanish.<ref name=Diaz>Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0140441239}}</ref>{{rp|294}}<ref name=Miguel/>{{rp|90}}\n\n[[File:Tenochtitlan.jpg|thumb|250px|A map of [[Tenochtitlan]] and its causeways leading out of the capital]]\n{{Aztecbox}}\n\nWith Moctezuma dead, Cort\u00e9s and Alvarado knew they were in a precarious position. Under constant attack, with gunpowder, food, and water in short supply, Cort\u00e9s decided to break out of the city by night. In order to put the Aztecs off their guard, he sent messengers asking for a one-week ceasefire, at the end of which the Spaniards would return any treasure of which they were in possession and would be permitted to leave the city peacefully.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|296}}\n\nSince the Aztecs had damaged bridges on four of the eight causeways into the island city, the Spaniards devised a portable bridge they could use in order to cross any unspanned sections of water. Cort\u00e9s ordered that as much of the accumulated gold and other booty as was feasible be packed and carried away, and invited the Spanish soldiers to take and carry away as much as they wished of the remainder. This invitation would lead to the demise of many soldiers who, overburdened with treasure, found it impossible to navigate the causeways and other obstacles encountered on the way out of the city.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|297,306}}\n\n===The Spanish head for the causeway out===\nOn the night of July 1, 1520,<ref name = \"calendar\">Various sources give dates ranging from June 30 to July 4, a problem further confounded by the use of the [[Julian calendar]] in Europe at this time, which had diverged from the true (solar) date by almost 12 days.</ref> Cortez's large army left their compound and headed west, toward the [[Tlacopan]] causeway. The causeway was apparently unguarded, and the Spaniards made their way out of their complex unnoticed, winding their way through the sleeping city under the cover of a rainstorm. Before reaching the causeway, they were noticed by Aztec warriors known as the [[Eagle Warriors]], who sounded the alarm.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|298,305}} {{discuss}} First by a woman drawing water, and then by the priest of [[Huitzilopochtli]] from atop [[Templo Mayor]].<ref name=Miguel>Le\u00f3n-Portilla, M. 1992, 'The [[Broken Spears]]: The Aztec Accounts of the Conquest of Mexico.'' Boston: Beacon Press, {{ISBN|978-0807055014}}</ref>{{rp|85}}\n\nThe fighting was ferocious. As the Spaniards and their native allies reached the causeway, hundreds of canoes appeared in the waters alongside to harry them. The Spaniards fought their way across the causeway in the rain. Weighed down by gold and equipment, some of the soldiers lost their footing, fell into the lake, and drowned. Amid a vanguard of horsemen, Cort\u00e9s pressed ahead and reached dry land at [[Tacuba, Mexico City|Tacuba]], leaving the rest of the expedition to fend for itself in the treacherous crossing.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|299\u2013300}}\n\nSeeing the wounded survivors straggle into the village, Cort\u00e9s and his horsemen turned back to the causeway, where they encountered [[Pedro de Alvarado]], unhorsed and badly wounded, in the company of a handful of Spaniards and [[Tlaxcaltecas]]. According to [[Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo]], it was at this point that tears came to Cort\u00e9s' eyes, as he realized the extent of the debacle.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|300}}\n\nCort\u00e9s, Alvarado and the strongest and most skilled of the men had managed to fight their way out of Tenochtitlan, although they were all bloodied and exhausted. Cort\u00e9s himself had been injured in the fighting. All of the artillery had been lost, as had most of the horses.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|302}}\n\nThe sources are not in agreement as to the total number of casualties suffered by the expedition. Cort\u00e9s himself claimed that 154 Spaniards were lost along with over 2,000 native allies. Thoan Cano, another eyewitness to the event, said that 1170 Spaniards died, but this number probably exceeds the total number of Spaniards who took part in the expedition.<ref name = \"Prescott\">Prescott, Appendix.</ref> [[Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara]], who was not himself an eyewitness, estimated that 450 Spaniards and 4,000 allies died.<ref>Prescott, Book 5, Chapter 3.</ref>\n\nMontezuma's son, [[Chimalpopoca (Moctezuma)]] was killed and the [[Tepanec]] prince [[Tlaltecatzin]],<ref name=Miguel/>{{rp|87}} King [[Cacamatzin]], his three sisters and two brothers were also killed.<ref name=Miguel/>{{rp|90}}\n\nDiaz states the Spaniards suffered 860 soldiers killed, which included those from the later [[Battle of Otumba]]. The Tlaxcaltecas lost a thousand. The noncombatants attached to the expedition suffered terribly, 72 casualties, including five Spanish women. The few women who survived included [[La Malinche]] the interpreter, Dona Luisa, and [[Mar\u00eda Estrada]].<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|302,305\u2013306}} The event was named La Noche Triste (\"The Night of Sorrows\") on account of the sorrow that Cort\u00e9s and his surviving followers felt and expressed at the loss of life and treasure incurred in the escape from Tenochtitlan.\n\n==Aftermath==\nFurther battles awaited the Spaniards and their allies as they fought their way around the north end of [[Lake Zumpango]]. Two weeks later, at the [[Battle of Otumba]], not far from [[Teotihuacan]], they turned to fight the pursuing Aztecs, decisively defeating them \u2014 according to Cort\u00e9s, because he slew the Aztec commander \u2014 and giving the Spaniards a small respite that allowed them to reach [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]].<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|303\u2013305}}\n\nIt was in Tlaxcala that Cort\u00e9s plotted the [[siege of Tenochtitlan]] and the eventual destruction of the Aztec Empire.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of battles won by Indigenous peoples of the Americas]]\n* [[History of the Aztecs]]\n* [[History of Mexico]]\n* [[Juan Velazquez de Leon]]\n* [[Cristobal de Olid]]\n* [[Gonzalo de Sandoval]]\n* [[Dona Marina]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Primary sources===\n* ''Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a'' (\"True History of the Conquest of New Spain\") by [[Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo]].
