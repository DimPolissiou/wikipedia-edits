Levett-Yeats''',  was the descendant of an old English trading family with connections to [[British India]]. S. Levett-Yeats became a soldier with the [[Indian Army (1895\u20131947)|Indian Army]] and later joined the [[Indian Civil Service]] as a low-level bureaucrat. Inspired by the example of other ambitious [[Anglo-Indian]] writers like [[Rudyard Kipling]], Levett-Yeats turned out a series of Victorian [[potboiler]]s, often set in Europe, that earned him a place on the bestseller lists of the day.\n[[File:Sidney Kilner Levett-Yeats.jpg|thumb|200px|Sidney Kilner Levett-Yeats]]\n\n==Family==\nLevett-Yeats was descended from [[Francis Levett]], an English factor working for the [[Levant Company]] in [[Livorno]], Italy, who later moved to British [[East Florida]] to become a planter. Levett's daughter married Dr. David Yeats, a physician who was the Secretary of the [[East Florida]] Colony in Florida. The [[Levett]]s were an old [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] family who grew rich building one of the first large English multinational trading firms, Sir Richard Levett & Co. In that capacity, the family traded around the globe, and Sir [[Richard Levett]], [[Lord Mayor of London]], served as an early member of the [[East India Company|London East India Company]]. Sidney Levett-Yeats was born in England, the son of Charles Levett-Yeats.

Levett-Yeats) was also a writer, as well as an illustrator, particularly of books relating to the fauna and flora of the subcontinent and the East. G.A. Levett-Yeats (1863&ndash;1938) lived in [[Calcutta]], and was best known for his illustrations for the books ''The Birds of Singapore Island'' and ''The Common Birds of India''. Like his brother, G.A.

He later entered the British government civil service in the [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]], where he began writing fiction on the side.

The genre was so popular that it was known as the 'cloak and sword school.' ''The Lord Protector'', for instance, set in the days of the [[English Commonwealth]] under Oliver Cromwell, describes the hunting down of an ardent [[Cavalier|Royalist]]. ''A Galahad of the Creeks'' was set during the [[Burma|Burmese]] wars. ''The Chevalier d'Auriac'' concerned [[Henry of Navarre]]. Other tales were set in swashbuckling Europe. ''Orrain: A Romance'', published by Methuen in London and by Longmans in the United States, told a tale of King [[Henry II of France]] and his wife Catherine de' Medici.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1dA8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA296&dq=%22s.+k.+levett-yeats%22&ei=3ssESaSuJY3gswPi_42yAw ''A Guide to the Best Historical Novels and Tales'', Jonathan Nield, Elkin Mathews, London, 1911]</ref>'' The Chevalier d'Auriac'' was serialized in [[Longman's Magazine]] in 1897.\n\nLevett's best-known book was ''The Honour of Savelli'', a tale of treachery and intrigue set during the era of the [[Borgias]] in medieval Italy.

He returned to England, where he lived as a successful, although mostly critically ignored, commercial novelist. Unlike Kipling, Levett-Yeats seemed more interested in rewards of the pocketbook rather than paeans from the critics, and by that measure, at least, he seems to have been a success.\n\nIn his retelling of medieval legends that echoed [[King Arthur]], Levett-Yeats provided a window into the British colonial mind at the end of the nineteenth century. Some scholars now suggest that Levett-Yeats' tales of chivalric derring-do mask a deeper insecurity about the English mandate in India. Underlying the romance of Levett-Yeats' tales, they suggest, is a darker world view, tinctured by the challenges to British authority in the Punjab after the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], which demonstrated how tenuous the East India Company's hold was on an enormous nation.

He conducted public speaking courses and formed what is now the oldest public speaking club in the world initially called The Rostrum but now simply Rostrum.\n\n== Biography ==\nWicks' father was a [[blacksmith]] who worked as [[farrier]] at [[Epsom Downs Racecourse]].<ref>Cheshire Life Magazine P30, 1956</ref> Wicks was educated at a village school and then became a clerk for a coal merchant. He attended [[Hackney Academy (later Hackney College)|Hackney Theological College]],<ref>Hallowed Be Thy Name: The Sanctification of All in the Soteriology of P. T Forsyth, Jason Goroncy, Bloomsbury, New York, 2013, p177</ref> University of London, via correspondence lessons for the Congregational Ministry, and became a Minister at the small Robinson St [[Congregational Church]], [[Hastings]].<ref>Public Speaking for Women, Sidney F Wicks, Frederick Muller Ltd, London, 1937, P. 9</ref>\n\nHe later became the minister at the much larger Norwood Congregational Church, [[Liverpool]], where he also studied for a Diploma of Social Science<ref>Manchester Guardian, P15, 22 September 1928</ref> at [[Liverpool University]]. He left the ministry as a result of his experience in the First World War.\n\nIn June 1914 Wicks married Dorothy E. Whitfield at [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]].  Their first son, David Whitfield Wicks, was born at [[West Derby]] in September 1915. Followed by Cedric Whitfield Wicks, born at [[Leicester]] in June 1918, a third son, Merlin Whitfield Wicks, was born at Chorlton June 1922. Their fourth son, Hereward Whitfield Wicks, was born at [[South Hylton]] in August 1924 but ded at the age of 20 months, on 30 May 1926.   \n[[File:Sidney F Wicks - Norwood Grove Congregational Church Liverpool.jpg|thumb|Norwood Congregational Church, Liverpool]]\n\nAfter retirement, Wicks entered the [[Catholic Church]] in 1942.  He joined the [[Third Order]] of the Catholic Church in 1946.\n\n== War years ==\n\nDuring the war Wicks was attached to the [[Fifth Army (United Kingdom)]] as a [[YMCA]] worker and Padre. While in a shell hole in [[France]], he made up his mind to quit the ministry.  He was injured and invalided back to England. On his return he took up the role of educational officer for YMCA at the [[Shoreham, Kent|Shoreham]] Army Camp, traveling to London and the Welsh border. \n  \n[[File:Sidney F Wicks, Dorothy - L-R Cedric, David and Merlin 1930s.001.jpg|thumb|Sidney F Wicks, Dorothy his wife and sons, left to right Cedric, David and Merlin 1930s]]\n\n== Work and business ==\n[[File:Sidney F Wicks 1934.jpg|thumb|Sidney F Wicks 1934.]]\nWicks joined the advertising department of ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' in 1923. In 1924 he took several months leave of absence for a lecture tour of American universities. He left ''The Guardian'' in 1925 to become joint managing director of Cross-Courtney Limited, advertising agents, business advisers and printers in [[Manchester]].<ref>Manchester Guardian, 13 July 1925, Page 3,</ref>\n\nHe also founded his own firm, Sidney F. Wicks Ltd, which provided advertising and business consultancy.  This firm was taken over by his son David after his death.\n\nIn 1932, Wicks was the Manchester business manager for the First International Summer School of Dance in Buxton.<ref>The Observer, P18, 24 July 2017</ref>\n\nAs editor in chief and chairman of directors of the [[Manchester Weekly News]] Limited, he was instrumental in taking over the ''Manchester City News''.\n\n== Publications ==\n\"The Legion of Splendid Women\" in The Girl\u2019s Own Paper and Woman\u2019s Magazine<ref>http://www.philsp.com/homeville/bjsp/t248.htm#A7886  item 185</ref>\n\nPublic Speaking for Business Men, 1924, Methuen & Co, London, 2nd Ed 1925, 3rd Ed 1933\n\nPublic Speaking Do\u2019s & Don\u2019ts, 1926, Frederick A Stokes Company, New York\n\nStories for Speeches - How to Prepare and Use Them, 1937, Frederick Muller Ltd, London\n\nPublic Speaking for Women, 1937, Frederick Muller Ltd, London\n\nSunwise, 1937, Frederick Muller Ltd, London\n\nThe Friends of St. Francis, 1952, Franciscan Herald Press, Chicago, Illinois\n\n== His communities ==\nWicks lived in many places in the UK. Being born in Surrey, he may have lived for a time in Hackney as a student. He lived in Hastings and Liverpool as a minister, Shoreham and France with the YMCA and the army, Manchester for business. In his forties, due to ill health his doctor advised that he move to the country side away from the Manchester smog.  He moved to the rural Borough of Buxton, about an hour's train journey from Manchester.\n\nHe worked with  community organisations in and around both Manchester and Buxton.  Examples are the YMCA, providing public speaking courses, the Soroptimist Club<ref>The Manchester Guardian, P3, 19 May 1941</ref> and was chairman of the Manchester Publicity Association,<ref>The Queensland Times, P8, 17 July 1938  (Broadcast By Queen Suggested),  http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/116905916/9917578</ref> participating in debates at the Athenaeum Debating Society, and delivering speeches for the Practical Psychology Club of Manchester<ref>The Manchester Guardian, P1, 3 February 1934</ref>\n\nDuring 1928 Wicks unsuccessfully stood as the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Candidate for [[Manchester City Council]] in the [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy]] ward.<ref>Manchester Guardian, P15, 22 September 1928</ref> In 1929 he was elected to the [[High Peak Borough Council|Buxton Borough Council]] representing the Rate Payers' Association.  He remained a Buxton Councillor for one term.<ref>Manchester Guardian, P20, 20 November 1929</ref>\n\nWicks was at times a newspaper correspondent writing articles such as the \"Future of Greek\", and \"Closing Churches\".<ref>The Manchester Guardian, P18, 10 August 1927</ref>  He also wrote letters to the editor on a number of topics;\n\nIn 1947 Sidney was appointed to the [[Dovedale]] Committee of the National Trust.\n\nHe lived in Buxton until the death of his wife in 1954 after which he moved for a short time to [[Alvescot]], Oxfordshire.\n\n== Public speaking ==\nSidney  provided public lectures on such things as \"The American and The English Business Man\",<ref>The Manchester Guardian, p3, 25 July 1924</ref> \"The United States of Great Britain and America\",<ref>The Manchester Guardian, P6, 1 November 1924</ref> \"The King's English in Business\",<ref>The Manchester Guardian, p10, 14 September 1925</ref> and \"Sincerity in Publicity\".<ref>The Manchester Guardian, P1, 3 February 1934</ref>  He also participated in debates at the YMCA on such topics as \"Esperanto\",<ref>Manchester Guardian, P20, 2 March 1928</ref> and \"That Democracy is a Failure\".<ref>The Manchester Guardian, P13, 4 March 1933</ref>\n\nHe ran Public Speaking courses initially for Pelman Institute and then later for the Manchester YMCA.  The YMCA initially commissioned Sidney to provide 10 sessions of \"Business Man's Class for Public Speaking\". This was so successful the class members wished to continue and the YMCA commissioned another 10 sessions for a new class. Sidney, already committed to a second series of 10 sessions for beginners on Fridays, continued with an advanced course on Wednesday nights where he would act as teacher and critic.\n\nIn 1924   Wicks embarked on a lecture tour of American Universities in 17 states.  The range of topics was broad and ranged from the address at [[Cornell University]]<ref>Cornell Alumni News Vol XXVI, No. 34, 29 May 1924,  Page 428</ref> on \"The Labor Party and the Labor Government in England\" to one in Pennsylvania on Shakespeare and modern language.\n\n=== The Rostrum ===\n[[File:Greendale Farm Mottram St Andrew, Yew Tree under which The Rostrum Club was Founded.jpg|thumb|Greendale Farm Mottram St Andrew, Yew Tree under which The Rostrum Club was Founded. Note the plaque]]\n[[File:Sidney F Wicks - paque from Yew Tree Greendale Farm recognising his starting of The Rostrum.jpg|thumb|Greendale Farm, Mottram St Andrew, Yew Tree under which The Rostrum Club was Founded, Plaque donated by David Whitfield-Wicks 1959]]\n\"'''The Rostrum'''\" was formed as a result of attendee of the advanced course, Douglas Wallwork, organising a 4.2 mile (6.7&nbsp;km) walk for course participants from Wilmslow to a [[Tea Room]] at [[Listed buildings in Mottram St Andrew|Greendale Farm]], [[Mottram St Andrew]] on 21 July 1923. In there discussions under the [[yew]] tree a club called The Rostrum was formed.  Under this Yew tree with Sidney F Wicks' guidance the purpose and scope of the club, the Rostrum Promise and the roles of the club key figures in the club were set.<ref>The Story of The Rostrum, Malcolm Green, P1, October 1961 (paper)</ref> Sidney was the recognised founder.\n\nThey set The Rostrum objects as:\n* The Rostrum is for those who desire to improve themselves in public speaking, and who hold freedom of speech, loyalty to truth, clarity of thought and a love of the English language are of the utmost value to the community.\n* The  Rostrum aims to enrich the fellowship of its members; it holds to an educational ideal.\n\nDue to Sidney's declining health and move to Buxton, after 1929 he mainly just attended The Rostrum club meetings on one night per year, Founder's Night, and he joined in an annual walk to Greendale Farm and the Yew tree on the closest Saturday to 21 July each year.\n\nWith Sidney's encouragement a visiting Australian engineer, Alan Crook, who was a club member between 1924 and 26, on his return to Australia he started a Rostrum club on 21 July 1930.  The first meeting of this club was under an Angophora tree in Sydney at Middle Harbour with the same Objective as The Rostrum club.  Numbers quickly grew through the Australian States and a national body called the Australian Rostrum Council was formed. There was ongoing association between the Australians and both The Rostrum club in Manchester and Sidney F Wicks.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Australian Rostrum Club members sent food parcels to England for the Wicks family and for The Rostrum club members.\n\nDuring the second World War, a Rostrum Club was formed in the [[Changi Prison]], [[Prisoner of War]] camp.

He joined the [[Third Order]] of the Catholic Church in 1946.\n\n== War years ==\n\nDuring the war Wicks was attached to the [[Fifth Army (United Kingdom)]] as a [[YMCA]] worker and Padre. While in a shell hole in [[France]], he made up his mind to quit the ministry.  He was injured and invalided back to England. On his return he took up the role of educational officer for YMCA at the [[Shoreham, Kent|Shoreham]] Army Camp, traveling to London and the Welsh border. \n  \n[[File:Sidney F Wicks, Dorothy - L-R Cedric, David and Merlin 1930s.001.jpg|thumb|Sidney F Wicks, Dorothy his wife and sons, left to right Cedric, David and Merlin 1930s]]\n\n== Work and business ==\n[[File:Sidney F Wicks 1934.jpg|thumb|Sidney F Wicks 1934.]]\nWicks joined the advertising department of ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' in 1923. In 1924 he took several months leave of absence for a lecture tour of American universities. He left ''The Guardian'' in 1925 to become joint managing director of Cross-Courtney Limited, advertising agents, business advisers and printers in [[Manchester]].<ref>Manchester Guardian, 13 July 1925, Page 3,</ref>\n\nHe also founded his own firm, Sidney F.

Being born in Surrey, he may have lived for a time in Hackney as a student. He lived in Hastings and Liverpool as a minister, Shoreham and France with the YMCA and the army, Manchester for business. In his forties, due to ill health his doctor advised that he move to the country side away from the Manchester smog.  He moved to the rural Borough of Buxton, about an hour's train journey from Manchester.\n\nHe worked with  community organisations in and around both Manchester and Buxton.  Examples are the YMCA, providing public speaking courses, the Soroptimist Club<ref>The Manchester Guardian, P3, 19 May 1941</ref> and was chairman of the Manchester Publicity Association,<ref>The Queensland Times, P8, 17 July 1938  (Broadcast By Queen Suggested),  http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/116905916/9917578</ref> participating in debates at the Athenaeum Debating Society, and delivering speeches for the Practical Psychology Club of Manchester<ref>The Manchester Guardian, P1, 3 February 1934</ref>\n\nDuring 1928 Wicks unsuccessfully stood as the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Candidate for [[Manchester City Council]] in the [[Chorlton-cum-Hardy]] ward.<ref>Manchester Guardian, P15, 22 September 1928</ref> In 1929 he was elected to the [[High Peak Borough Council|Buxton Borough Council]] representing the Rate Payers' Association.  He remained a Buxton Councillor for one term.<ref>Manchester Guardian, P20, 20 November 1929</ref>\n\nWicks was at times a newspaper correspondent writing articles such as the \"Future of Greek\", and \"Closing Churches\".<ref>The Manchester Guardian, P18, 10 August 1927</ref>  He also wrote letters to the editor on a number of topics;\n\nIn 1947 Sidney was appointed to the [[Dovedale]] Committee of the National Trust.\n\nHe lived in Buxton until the death of his wife in 1954 after which he moved for a short time to [[Alvescot]], Oxfordshire.\n\n== Public speaking ==\nSidney  provided public lectures on such things as \"The American and The English Business Man\",<ref>The Manchester Guardian, p3, 25 July 1924</ref> \"The United States of Great Britain and America\",<ref>The Manchester Guardian, P6, 1 November 1924</ref> \"The King's English in Business\",<ref>The Manchester Guardian, p10, 14 September 1925</ref> and \"Sincerity in Publicity\".<ref>The Manchester Guardian, P1, 3 February 1934</ref>  He also participated in debates at the YMCA on such topics as \"Esperanto\",<ref>Manchester Guardian, P20, 2 March 1928</ref> and \"That Democracy is a Failure\".<ref>The Manchester Guardian, P13, 4 March 1933</ref>\n\nHe ran Public Speaking courses initially for Pelman Institute and then later for the Manchester YMCA.  The YMCA initially commissioned Sidney to provide 10 sessions of \"Business Man's Class for Public Speaking\". This was so successful the class members wished to continue and the YMCA commissioned another 10 sessions for a new class. Sidney, already committed to a second series of 10 sessions for beginners on Fridays, continued with an advanced course on Wednesday nights where he would act as teacher and critic.\n\nIn 1924   Wicks embarked on a lecture tour of American Universities in 17 states.  The range of topics was broad and ranged from the address at [[Cornell University]]<ref>Cornell Alumni News Vol XXVI, No. 34, 29 May 1924,  Page 428</ref> on \"The Labor Party and the Labor Government in England\" to one in Pennsylvania on Shakespeare and modern language.\n\n=== The Rostrum ===\n[[File:Greendale Farm Mottram St Andrew, Yew Tree under which The Rostrum Club was Founded.jpg|thumb|Greendale Farm Mottram St Andrew, Yew Tree under which The Rostrum Club was Founded. Note the plaque]]\n[[File:Sidney F Wicks - paque from Yew Tree Greendale Farm recognising his starting of The Rostrum.jpg|thumb|Greendale Farm, Mottram St Andrew, Yew Tree under which The Rostrum Club was Founded, Plaque donated by David Whitfield-Wicks 1959]]\n\"'''The Rostrum'''\" was formed as a result of attendee of the advanced course, Douglas Wallwork, organising a 4.2 mile (6.7&nbsp;km) walk for course participants from Wilmslow to a [[Tea Room]] at [[Listed buildings in Mottram St Andrew|Greendale Farm]], [[Mottram St Andrew]] on 21 July 1923. In there discussions under the [[yew]] tree a club called The Rostrum was formed.  Under this Yew tree with Sidney F Wicks' guidance the purpose and scope of the club, the Rostrum Promise and the roles of the club key figures in the club were set.<ref>The Story of The Rostrum, Malcolm Green, P1, October 1961 (paper)</ref> Sidney was the recognised founder.\n\nThey set The Rostrum objects as:\n* The Rostrum is for those who desire to improve themselves in public speaking, and who hold freedom of speech, loyalty to truth, clarity of thought and a love of the English language are of the utmost value to the community.\n* The  Rostrum aims to enrich the fellowship of its members; it holds to an educational ideal.\n\nDue to Sidney's declining health and move to Buxton, after 1929 he mainly just attended The Rostrum club meetings on one night per year, Founder's Night, and he joined in an annual walk to Greendale Farm and the Yew tree on the closest Saturday to 21 July each year.\n\nWith Sidney's encouragement a visiting Australian engineer, Alan Crook, who was a club member between 1924 and 26, on his return to Australia he started a Rostrum club on 21 July 1930.  The first meeting of this club was under an Angophora tree in Sydney at Middle Harbour with the same Objective as The Rostrum club.  Numbers quickly grew through the Australian States and a national body called the Australian Rostrum Council was formed. There was ongoing association between the Australians and both The Rostrum club in Manchester and Sidney F Wicks.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Australian Rostrum Club members sent food parcels to England for the Wicks family and for The Rostrum club members.\n\nDuring the second World War, a Rostrum Club was formed in the [[Changi Prison]], [[Prisoner of War]] camp.  It was called [[AGH Rostrum Club at Changi|A. G. H. Rostrum]] standing for Australian General Hospital and held its first meeting on 18 May 1943. The scant records of the club include agenda with topics such as \"That tradition is a bar to progress\", \"Is an enduring peace possible?\", \"The importance of increased pleasure time\", \"Preservation of the Fauna of Australia\" and \"That women should participate in industry on an equal basis to me\".
