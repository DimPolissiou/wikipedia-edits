The series is published by [[HarperCollins]] and written by authors [[Kate Cary]], [[Cherith Baldry]], and [[Tui T. Sutherland]], with the plot developed by editor [[Victoria Holmes]] under the collective pseudonym [[Erin Hunter]].\n\nThere are currently seven sub-series, each containing six books except for the seventh sub-series, which is currently in progress. The first, ''Warriors'' (later re-titled ''Warriors: The Prophecies Begin''), was published from 2003 to 2004, and details the adventures of a kittypet ([[housecat]]) named Rusty, later Firepaw, Fireheart, and Firestar, who is named after his bright orange pelt, joins ThunderClan, and a Prophecy of him, \"Fire will save the clans\". ''Warriors: The New Prophecy'', published from 2005 to 2006, follows the first sub-series, chronicling the Clans' journey to a new home. The third story arc, ''Warriors: Power of Three'', was published from 2007 to 2009, and centres around a prophecy about three cats with extraordinary powers. The fourth sub-series, ''Warriors: Omen of the Stars'', was published from 2009 to 2012 and continues the story arc of ''Warriors: Power of Three''. The fifth sub-series, ''Warriors: Dawn of the Clans'', was published from 2013 to 2015. This prequel series arc details the formation of the Clans. The sixth sub-series, ''Warriors: A Vision of Shadows,'' was published from 2016 to 2018. Chronologically, ''Warriors: A Vision of Shadows'' follows ''Warriors: Omen of the Stars''. The seventh sub-series is entitled ''Warriors: The Broken Code''. The first book in the seventh series, ''Lost Stars'', was released on 9 April 2019.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062823526/warriors-the-broken-code-1-lost-stars/ | title=Warriors: The Broken Code #1: Lost Stars | publisher=Harper Collins Publishers | accessdate=5 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nOther books have been released in addition to the main series, including eleven lengthier stand-alone \"Super Edition\" novels, several e-book novellas later published in five print compilations, six guide books, and several volumes of [[original English-language manga]], initially produced as a collaboration between HarperCollins and [[TOKYOPOP]] before the latter's closure. The series has also been translated into several languages. [[Alibaba Pictures]] has acquired the [[Warriors (upcoming film)|film rights]] to the series as of 2016.\n\nMajor themes in the series include adventure, forbidden love, the concept of [[Nature versus nurture|nature vs. nurture]], acceptance, the struggle of good vs. evil, the reactions of different faiths meeting each other, and all cats  being a mix of good and bad. The authors draw inspiration from several natural locations and other authors such as [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[J. K. Rowling]], and [[William Shakespeare]].\n\n''Warriors'' has received mostly positive reviews. And nominated for several awards, ''Warriors'' has yet to receive any major literary prizes. Several novels in the series have reached the [[New York Times Bestseller List|''New York Times'' Bestseller List]], and the series has found popularity in many countries, including [[Trinidad]], the U.K, Germany, and China.\n\n==Inspiration and origins==\n[[File:Alder trees beaulieu river fawley ford.jpg|thumb|175px|[[New Forest]], which became the base for the forest the cats live in]]\nThe series first began when publisher [[HarperCollins]] asked Victoria Holmes to write a fantasy series about feral cats.

The cats are split into four groups called Clans: ThunderClan lives in woodland areas, WindClan resides on the [[Moorland|moors]], RiverClan by the river, and ShadowClan within and around the swamps. SkyClan, a subsequently introduced fifth group, is revealed to have been a part of this system but was forced to flee when their territory was destroyed by humans for urban development. Each Clan has adapted to their own terrain; RiverClan cats, for example, swim in the river to catch fish, while the majority of cats from the other Clans fear and avoid bodies of water. WindClan cats, who are exceptionally fast, are perfectly suited to catching rabbits and hares on the open plains. Relationships between different Clans are tense and they often come into conflict with one another. However, the Clans also sometimes show concern for each other; the idea of one Clan being destroyed usually causes deep distress and prompts urgent action on behalf of all four Clans. This had led to the rare occasion of all 4 clans uniting against a common enemy, although relationships are generally hostile for most of the series.\n\nThe Clan cats have a faith system based on the concept of StarClan, a heavenly land where the spirits of the Clans' deceased ancestors live, who provide guidance to the living Clan cats, usually those of the Clan in which they resided in life. After death, the spirits of most Clan cats join StarClan. StarClan often provides guidance to the Clans through dreams and other signs like [[omen]]s, most often directed towards each Clan's medicine cats, part of whose role it is to commune with StarClan, in addition to providing medical care to their Clan. In addition to StarClan, there exists the Dark Forest, similar to [hell], also known as The Place of No Stars, which takes the form of a never-ending forest. The spirits of cats who caused great pain and suffering to others while alive walk alone there as a form of punishment. Although cats of the Dark Forest are meant to be isolated as punishment, they eventually learn how to appear in the dreams of living cats much the way StarClan does.\n\nCats who live outside of the Clans are categorized into three groups. [[Housecats]], referred to as \"kittypets\" by Clan cats, are often looked down upon by the Clan cats for their cozy and lazy lifestyle. \"Loners\" are feral cats who live outside of the Clans, usually by themselves. They are often regarded by the Clans with suspicion. Similar to loners are \"rogues\", who differ in that they try to cause the Clan cats harm. It is rare, though not unheard of, for a kittypet, loner, or rogue to join a Clan, as outsiders are generally distrusted by Clan cats. In several instances, Clans that have taken in outsiders, one reason being to recruit new warriors for their Clan, have been met with scorn by the other Clans.\n\nBeyond the Clans' territories lies a mountain range, inhabited by the Tribe of Rushing Water (often referred to simply as the Tribe), a group of cats who follow a different set of ancestors: the Tribe of Endless Hunting. The Tribe has a different hierarchical structure than the Clans, consisting of a Healer, cave-guards, and prey-hunters, who each serve a different function in the Tribe. The Healer leads the Tribe, heals the ill and wounded, and communicates with the Tribe of Endless Hunting; the cave-guards defend the Tribe and the prey-hunters hunt for the Tribe. In a subsequent prequel series, it is revealed that the Tribe was formed by the predecessors of the Clans when they left the [[lake]] territory to live in the mountains. In turn, cats from the Tribe later moved to the forest of the original series and formed the Clans.\n\n==Series==\n===''Warriors: The Prophecies Begin''===\n{{Main|Warriors (arc)}}\nThe original ''Warriors'' series, later re-titled ''Warriors: The Prophecies Begin'',<ref name=\"KateTwitter\"/> was released from 2003 to 2004 and consists of six books: ''[[Into the Wild (Warriors)|Into the Wild]]'' (21 January 2003), ''[[Fire and Ice (Warriors)|Fire and Ice]]'' (27 May 2003), ''[[Forest of Secrets (Warriors)|Forest of Secrets]]'' (14 October 2003), ''[[Rising Storm (Warriors)|Rising Storm]]'' (6 January 2004), ''[[A Dangerous Path (Warriors)|A Dangerous Path]]'' (1 June 2004), and ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]'' (5 October 2004).<ref name=\"ITWHarper\">{{cite web|title=Warriors #1: Into the Wild|publisher=HarperCollins|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/9780060000028/warriors-1-into-the-wild|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-2-Fire-Ice-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000035|title=HarperCollins: Warriors #2: Fire and Ice by Erin Hunter(Hardcover)|accessdate=23 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021020154/http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-2-Fire-Ice-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000035|archive-date=21 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-3-Forest-Secrets-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000042|title=Warriors #3: Forest of Secrets by Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|accessdate=1 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021020820/http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-3-Forest-Secrets-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000042|archive-date=21 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-4-Rising-Storm-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000059|title=Warriors #4: Rising Storm by Erin Hunter (Hardcover)|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=8 August 2010|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/68wC5eTgl?url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-4-Rising-Storm-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000059|archive-date=5 July 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-5-Dangerous-Path-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000066|title=Warriors #5: A Dangerous Path by Erin Hunter (Hardcover)|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=9 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021053629/http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-5-Dangerous-Path-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000066|archive-date=21 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-6-Darkest-Hour-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000073|title=The Darkest Hour by Erin Hunter (Hardcover)|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=21 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021082009/http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-6-Darkest-Hour-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000073|archive-date=21 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The series was subtitled ''The Prophecies Begin'' for its re-release with new covers in 2015.<ref name=\"KateTwitter\">{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/KatieThreeCats/status/517970484827549696|quote=The first Warriors series is finally to get its own name with its relaunch next year: \"The Prophecies Begin\".

To combat this, one cat from all four Clan\u2019s is chosen to journey and find a new home for the cats to live. These cats are Tawnypelt of ShadowClan, Crowpaw (later Crowfeather) of WindClan, Feathertail of RiverClan, and Brambleclaw of ThunderClan, the latter of whom also struggles with his heritage as the late Tigerstar\u2019s son. Feathertail\u2019s brother Stormfur and the ThunderClan apprentice Squirrelpaw (later Squirrelflight) also accompany them.\n\nThe first book, \"Midnight\" mainly revolves around the four chosen cats having their dream and leaving with Squirrelpaw/flight and Stormfur. Then, making a perilous journey and finding \"Midnight\", a wise badger. They then have to deliver a cryptic message from her which meant that the clans had to leave their home and that \"a dying warrior will show the way\". They decide to go over the mountains as it's safer than the route they took to get there.\n\nThe second book's main theme is the six getting through the mountains and getting home alive. They meet The Tribe Of Rushing Water who tries to keep Stormfur, believing him to be the cat who will save them from Sharptooth, a [[mountain lion]]. It turns out to be Feathertail who is the silver cat destined to save the tribe and she dies plunging a rock into its neck, killing it. It also says that Leafpaw/pool gets trapped by the Twolegs ([[humans]]), who don<nowiki>'t want cats getting in their way when they destroy the forest. It ends with Leafpaw/pool captured and the now five cats seeing their home. The middle books focus on a journey that all the clans go on together to get to their new home. The last two books mainly focus on a vision that \"Blood will spill blood and the lake will turn red\"</nowiki>.\n\n===''Warriors: Power of Three''===\n{{main|Warriors: Power of Three}}\nThe third series, ''Warriors: Power of Three'', was released from 2007 to 2009 and consists of six books: ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]'' (24 April 2007), ''[[Dark River (Warriors)|Dark River]]'' (26 December 2007), ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'' (22 April 2008), ''[[Eclipse (Warriors)|Eclipse]]'' (2 September 2008), ''[[Long Shadows]]'' (25 November 2008), and ''[[Sunrise (novel)|Sunrise]]'' (21 April 2009).<ref name=\"DRHarper\">{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/9780060892050/warriors-power-of-three-2-dark-river|title=Warriors: Power of Three #2: Dark River|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"OutcastHarper\">{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/9780060892081/warriors-power-of-three-3-outcast|title=Warriors: Power of Three #3: Outcast|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780060892111/Warriors_Power_of_Three_4_Eclipse/index.aspx|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=10 August 2013|title=Warriors: Power of Three #4: Eclipse}}</ref><ref name=\"SunriseHarper\">{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/9780060892180/warriors-power-of-three-6-sunrise|title=Warriors: Power of Three #6: Sunrise|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.ca/books/Warriors-Power-of-Three-5-Long-Shadows/?isbn=9780060892142 |title=Warriors: Power of Three #5: Long Shadows|work=HarperCollins|accessdate=10 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.ca/books/Warriors-Power-of-Three-1-The-Sight/?isbn=9780060892012|title=Warriors: Power of Three #1:The Sight|work=HarperCollins|accessdate=10 August 2013}}</ref> The plot is centered on the prophecy, ''\"There will be three, kin of your kin, who hold the power of the stars in their paws\"'', which was given to Firestar in ''[[Firestar's Quest]]'' by Skywatcher.<ref name=FQBook>{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Erin|title=Firestar's Quest|year=2007|url=http://www.harpercollinschildrens.com/Books/Firestars-Quest|publisher=HarperCollins}}</ref> The series revolves around Jayfeather, Hollyleaf, and Lionblaze, children of Brambleclaw and Squirrelflight, and grandchildren of the ThunderClan leader Firestar, who discover that they each have a unique power.

These relationships are not allowed for various reasons: some involve medicine cats, who are not allowed to have mates according to the medicine cat code, while others develop between cats in different Clans, which is also forbidden by the warrior code (for example, Graystripe of ThunderClan and Silverstream of RiverClan). Holmes said that another central theme of the series is \"faith and spirituality\" in StarClan.<ref name=fifthchat>{{cite web|title=Erin Hunter chat #5 transcript - August 16, 2008|url=http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/5784|work=Wands and Worlds|accessdate=30 March 2013|date=16 August 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017050931/http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/5784|archivedate=17 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  All books in the series feature the influence of StarClan, not just as the cats think of them, but in terms of prophecies delivered by StarClan which inevitably come true.  Some scenes take place within StarClan's realm, with no living cats present as point-of-view characters.  Thus the existence of an afterlife and the influence of spirits who have passed on and yet retain their earthly identities is integral to all of the plot arcs in the series. Another idea explored in the novels is the reactions of different faiths when meeting each other. For example, the Tribe of Rushing Water, which believes in different spiritual ancestors than the Clans, is introduced in ''Moonrise''. In an author chat, Holmes explained that the books never say that either of the Clans or the Tribe of Rushing Water is right about faith because both are \"equally valid.\" This leads to fear and suspicion between them because they are afraid of things they do not understand. Holmes said that \"ignorance is a very scary thing!\"<ref name=\"Second Chat\">{{cite web|title=Erin Hunter chat #2|url=http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/124|work=Wands and Worlds |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010001755/http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/124 |archivedate=10 October 2007}}</ref> Non-belief is also significant in the storylines: Mothwing and Cloudtail do not believe in StarClan.<ref name=\"Chat3part2\">{{cite web|url=http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/882|title=Erin Hunter Chat No. 3 Transcript&nbsp;\u2014 part 2|work=Wands and Worlds|accessdate=2 March 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222012441/http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/882|archivedate=22 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Kittypets, loners, and rouges were also a very important theme (at least for Erin Hunter).\n\nAnother theme is that characters can be a mix of good and evil. Holmes has said she is fascinated by these \"shades of gray\" in personalities. Her example of this was when Bluestar, a noble and honorable cat, gave up her kits for her own ambitions so an evil cat would not take over. Another example she gave of this is how the antagonist Tigerstar, even with all of his faults, is still courageous and fiercely loyal.<ref name=\"Nick\"/> Similarly, Holmes has also connected the theme to Brambleclaw and how nobody knew whether he was good or evil.<ref name=\"FourthChat\" /> A third major theme, often referred to as [[nature versus nurture]], explores whether a person is born the way he or she will be, or if other things shape that. For example, Brambleclaw's father is the evil Tigerstar, but he eventually demonstrates that despite this, he is not evil himself, despite initial suspicion from Clanmates due to his father's legacy. This theme ties into the \"shades of gray\" theme.<ref name=\"Second Chat\" /> similar to the book \u00a8Forest dogs\u00a8.\n\nA reviewer for ''Publishers Weekly'' noted that friendship and responsibility are taught to characters in the novels,<ref name=\"publishers-weekly\"/> while booksforyouths.com had a reviewer who pointed out the idea that, just as Clan cats shun house cats for their soft life, people should realize that it is necessary to experience hardship in life.<ref name=booksforyouths>{{cite web|url=http://booksforyouth.wordpress.com/2009/05/14/into-the-wild-warriors-book-1-by-erin-hunter/|title=booksforyouth Review|date=14 May 2009|publisher=booksforyouth.com|accessdate=20 July 2010}}</ref> A Storysnoops review noted that one of the themes was that \"it doesn't matter where you come from, only who you are inside\".<ref name=\"fireandicereview\">{{cite web|url=http://storysnoops.com/detail.php?id=248|title=Storysnoops Review|publisher=storysnoops.com|accessdate=23 July 2010}}</ref> In ''Dawn'', the importance of cooperation is explored.

The second of two plays by Erin Hunter, ''Brightspirit's Mercy'' is about Jaypaw, Lionblaze, and Hollyleaf. After going to a Gathering, where it is obvious all of the Clans except for ThunderClan are starving, three cats from StarClan appear to them: Brightspirit and her parents, Shiningheart and Braveheart, characters created on ''Wands and Worlds'', a fantasy fiction forum, in memory of a 10-year-old ''Warriors'' fan, Emmy Grace Cherry, and her parents, Dana and Jimmy Cherry, who were killed in a tornado in February 2007.<ref name=brightspirit>{{cite web|url=http://www.brightspiritrelieffund.com|title=Brightspirit Relief Fund|work=IMC studios}}</ref> They tell the three young cats that they must help feed the other Clans.

Ashfoot, WindClan's deputy, accepts the gift, but Breezepaw, too proud to have help from another Clan, refuses to eat it.

Several novels in the series have reached the [[New York Times Bestseller List|''New York Times'' Bestseller List]], and the series has found popularity in many countries, including [[Trinidad]], the U.K, Germany, and China.\n\n==Inspiration and origins==\n[[File:Alder trees beaulieu river fawley ford.jpg|thumb|175px|[[New Forest]], which became the base for the forest the cats live in]]\nThe series first began when publisher [[HarperCollins]] asked Victoria Holmes to write a fantasy series about feral cats. Holmes was initially not enthusiastic, since she \"couldn't imagine coming up with enough ideas\". She worked with the concept, however, expanding the storyline with elements of war, politics, revenge, doomed love, and religious conflict.<ref name=\"Postchat6\">{{cite web|url=http://wandsandworlds.com/community/ErinHunter6-postchat|title=Transcript of Erin Hunter Post Chat 6|accessdate=24 July 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201055534/http://wandsandworlds.com/community/ErinHunter6-postchat|archivedate=1 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Although the original plan was for a stand-alone novel, enough material was created for several books, and the publisher decided on a six-volume series.<ref name=\"Postchat6\"/> The first volume, ''Into the Wild'', was written by Kate Cary under the pseudonym \"Erin Hunter\" and was completed in about three months.<ref name=\"FirstChat\"/> Holmes then began to work behind the scenes, editing and supervising details.<ref name=\"Writers Unboxed\">{{cite web|url=http://writerunboxed.com/2006/04/21/author-interview-erin-hunter/|title=INTERVIEW: Erin Hunter|work=Writers Unboxed|accessdate=2 August 2008}}</ref> [[Cherith Baldry]] joined the team to write the third book, ''Forest of Secrets''.

The cats are split into four groups called Clans: ThunderClan lives in woodland areas, WindClan resides on the [[Moorland|moors]], RiverClan by the river, and ShadowClan within and around the swamps. SkyClan, a subsequently introduced fifth group, is revealed to have been a part of this system but was forced to flee when their territory was destroyed by humans for urban development. Each Clan has adapted to their own terrain; RiverClan cats, for example, swim in the river to catch fish, while the majority of cats from the other Clans fear and avoid bodies of water. Relationships between different Clans are tense and they often come into conflict with one another. However, the Clans also sometimes show concern for each other; the idea of one Clan being destroyed usually causes deep distress and prompts urgent action on behalf of all four Clans.\n\nThe Clan cats have a faith system based on the concept of StarClan, a group of the spirits of the Clans' deceased ancestors who provide guidance to the living Clan cats, usually those of the Clan in which they resided in life. After death, the spirits of most Clan cats join StarClan. StarClan often provides guidance to the Clans through dreams and other signs like [[omen]]s, most often directed towards each Clan's medicine cats, part of whose role it is to commune with StarClan, in addition to providing medical care to their Clan. In addition to StarClan, there exists the Dark Forest, also known as The Place of No Stars, which takes the form of a never-ending forest. The spirits of cats who caused great pain and suffering to others while alive walk alone there as a form of punishment. Although cats of the Dark Forest are meant to be isolated as punishment, they eventually learn how to appear in the dreams of living cats much the way StarClan does.\n\nCats who live outside of the Clans are categorized into three groups. [[Housecats]], referred to as \"kittypets\" by Clan cats, are often looked down upon by the Clan cats for their cozy and lazy lifestyle. \"Loners\" are feral cats who live outside of the Clans, usually by themselves. They are often regarded by the Clans with suspicion. Similar to loners are \"rogues\", who differ in that they try to cause the Clan cats harm. It is rare, though not unheard of, for a kittypet, loner, or rogue to join a Clan, as outsiders are generally distrusted by Clan cats. In several instances, Clans that have taken in outsiders have been met with scorn by the other Clans.\n\nBeyond the Clans' territories lies a mountain range, inhabited by the Tribe of Rushing Water (often referred to simply as the Tribe), a group of cats who follow a different set of ancestors: the Tribe of Endless Hunting. The Tribe has a different hierarchical structure than the Clans, consisting of a Healer, cave-guards, and prey-hunters, who each serve a different function in the Tribe. The Healer leads the Tribe, heals the ill and wounded, and communicates with the Tribe of Endless Hunting; the cave-guards defend the Tribe and the prey-hunters hunt for the Tribe. In a subsequent prequel series, it is revealed that the Tribe was formed by the predecessors of the Clans when they left the [[lake]] territory to live in the mountains. In turn, cats from the Tribe later moved to the forest of the original series and formed the Clans.\n\n==Series==\n===''Warriors: The Prophecies Begin''===\n{{Main|Warriors (arc)}}\nThe original ''Warriors'' series, later re-titled ''Warriors: The Prophecies Begin'',<ref name=\"KateTwitter\"/> was released from 2003 to 2004 and consists of six books: ''[[Into the Wild (Warriors)|Into the Wild]]'' (21 January 2003), ''[[Fire and Ice (Warriors)|Fire and Ice]]'' (27 May 2003), ''[[Forest of Secrets (Warriors)|Forest of Secrets]]'' (14 October 2003), ''[[Rising Storm (Warriors)|Rising Storm]]'' (6 January 2004), ''[[A Dangerous Path (Warriors)|A Dangerous Path]]'' (1 June 2004), and ''[[The Darkest Hour (Warriors)|The Darkest Hour]]'' (5 October 2004).<ref name=\"ITWHarper\">{{cite web|title=Warriors #1: Into the Wild|publisher=HarperCollins|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/9780060000028/warriors-1-into-the-wild|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-2-Fire-Ice-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000035|title=HarperCollins: Warriors #2: Fire and Ice by Erin Hunter(Hardcover)|accessdate=23 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021020154/http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-2-Fire-Ice-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000035|archive-date=21 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-3-Forest-Secrets-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000042|title=Warriors #3: Forest of Secrets by Erin Hunter|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|accessdate=1 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021020820/http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-3-Forest-Secrets-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000042|archive-date=21 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-4-Rising-Storm-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000059|title=Warriors #4: Rising Storm by Erin Hunter (Hardcover)|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=8 August 2010|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/68wC5eTgl?url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-4-Rising-Storm-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000059|archive-date=5 July 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-5-Dangerous-Path-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000066|title=Warriors #5: A Dangerous Path by Erin Hunter (Hardcover)|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=9 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021053629/http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-5-Dangerous-Path-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000066|archive-date=21 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-6-Darkest-Hour-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000073|title=The Darkest Hour by Erin Hunter (Hardcover)|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=21 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021082009/http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Warriors-6-Darkest-Hour-Erin-Hunter/?isbn=9780060000073|archive-date=21 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The series was subtitled ''The Prophecies Begin'' for its re-release with new covers in 2015.<ref name=\"KateTwitter\">{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/KatieThreeCats/status/517970484827549696|quote=The first Warriors series is finally to get its own name with its relaunch next year: \"The Prophecies Begin\".

To combat this, one cat from all four Clan\u2019s is chosen to journey and find a new home for the cats to live. These cats are Tawnypelt of ShadowClan, Crowpaw (later Crowfeather) of WindClan, Feathertail of RiverClan, and Brambleclaw of ThunderClan, the latter of whom also struggles with his heritage as the late Tigerstar\u2019s son. Feathertail\u2019s brother Stormfur and the ThunderClan apprentice Squirrelpaw (later Squirrelflight) also accompany them.\n\nThe first book, \"Midnight\" mainly revolves around the four chosen cats having their dream and leaving with Squirrelpaw/flight and Stormfur. Then, making a perilous journey and finding \"Midnight\", a wise badger. They then have to deliver a cryptic message from her which meant that the clans had to leave their home and that \"a dying warrior will show the way\". They decide to go over the mountains as it's safer than the route they took to get there.\n\nThe second book's main theme is the six getting through the mountains and getting home alive. They meet The Tribe Of Rushing Water who tries to keep Stormfur, believing him to be the cat who will save them from Sharptooth, a [[mountain lion]]. It turns out to be Feathertail who is the silver cat destined to save the tribe and she dies plunging a rock into its neck, killing it. It also says that Leafpaw/pool gets trapped by the Twolegs ([[humans]]), who don<nowiki>'t want cats getting in their way when they destroy the forest. It ends with Leafpaw/pool captured and the now five cats seeing their home. The middle books focus on a journey that all the clans go on together to get to their new home. The last two books mainly focus on a vision that \"Blood will spill blood and the lake will turn red\"</nowiki>.\n\n===''Warriors: Power of Three''===\n{{main|Warriors: Power of Three}}\nThe third series, ''Warriors: Power of Three'', was released from 2007 to 2009 and consists of six books: ''[[The Sight (Warriors)|The Sight]]'' (24 April 2007), ''[[Dark River (Warriors)|Dark River]]'' (26 December 2007), ''[[Outcast (Warriors)|Outcast]]'' (22 April 2008), ''[[Eclipse (Warriors)|Eclipse]]'' (2 September 2008), ''[[Long Shadows]]'' (25 November 2008), and ''[[Sunrise (novel)|Sunrise]]'' (21 April 2009).<ref name=\"DRHarper\">{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/9780060892050/warriors-power-of-three-2-dark-river|title=Warriors: Power of Three #2: Dark River|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"OutcastHarper\">{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/9780060892081/warriors-power-of-three-3-outcast|title=Warriors: Power of Three #3: Outcast|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780060892111/Warriors_Power_of_Three_4_Eclipse/index.aspx|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=10 August 2013|title=Warriors: Power of Three #4: Eclipse}}</ref><ref name=\"SunriseHarper\">{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/9780060892180/warriors-power-of-three-6-sunrise|title=Warriors: Power of Three #6: Sunrise|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.ca/books/Warriors-Power-of-Three-5-Long-Shadows/?isbn=9780060892142 |title=Warriors: Power of Three #5: Long Shadows|work=HarperCollins|accessdate=10 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.ca/books/Warriors-Power-of-Three-1-The-Sight/?isbn=9780060892012|title=Warriors: Power of Three #1:The Sight|work=HarperCollins|accessdate=10 August 2013}}</ref> The plot is centered on the prophecy, ''\"There will be three, kin of your kin, who hold the power of the stars in their paws\"'', which was given to Firestar in ''[[Firestar's Quest]]'' by Skywatcher.<ref name=FQBook>{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Erin|title=Firestar's Quest|year=2007|url=http://www.harpercollinschildrens.com/Books/Firestars-Quest|publisher=HarperCollins}}</ref> The series revolves around Jayfeather, Hollyleaf, and Lionblaze, children of Brambleclaw and Squirrelflight, and grandchildren of the ThunderClan leader Firestar, who discover that they each have a unique power.

These relationships are not allowed for various reasons: some involve medicine cats, who are not allowed to have mates according to the medicine cat code, while others develop between cats in different Clans, which is also forbidden by the warrior code (for example, Graystripe of ThunderClan and Silverstream of RiverClan). Holmes said that another central theme of the series is \"faith and spirituality\" in StarClan.<ref name=fifthchat>{{cite web|title=Erin Hunter chat #5 transcript - August 16, 2008|url=http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/5784|work=Wands and Worlds|accessdate=30 March 2013|date=16 August 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017050931/http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/5784|archivedate=17 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  All books in the series feature the influence of StarClan, not just as the cats think of them, but in terms of prophecies delivered by StarClan which inevitably come true.  Some scenes take place within StarClan's realm, with no living cats present as point-of-view characters.  Thus the existence of an afterlife and the influence of spirits who have passed on and yet retain their earthly identities is integral to all of the plot arcs in the series. Another idea explored in the novels is the reactions of different faiths when meeting each other. For example, the Tribe of Rushing Water, which believes in different spiritual ancestors than the Clans, is introduced in ''Moonrise''. In an author chat, Holmes explained that the books never say that either of the Clans or the Tribe of Rushing Water is right about faith because both are \"equally valid.\" This leads to fear and suspicion between them because they are afraid of things they do not understand. Holmes said that \"ignorance is a very scary thing!\"<ref name=\"Second Chat\">{{cite web|title=Erin Hunter chat #2|url=http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/124|work=Wands and Worlds |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010001755/http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/124 |archivedate=10 October 2007}}</ref> Non-belief is also significant in the storylines: Mothwing and Cloudtail do not believe in StarClan.<ref name=\"Chat3part2\">{{cite web|url=http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/882|title=Erin Hunter Chat No. 3 Transcript&nbsp;\u2014 part 2|work=Wands and Worlds|accessdate=2 March 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222012441/http://wandsandworlds.com/community/node/882|archivedate=22 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Kittypets, loners, and rouges were also a very important theme (at least for Erin Hunter).\n\nAnother theme is that characters can be a mix of good and evil. Holmes has said she is fascinated by these \"shades of gray\" in personalities. Her example of this was when Bluestar, a noble and honorable cat, gave up her kits for her own ambitions so an evil cat would not take over. Another example she gave of this is how the antagonist Tigerstar, even with all of his faults, is still courageous and fiercely loyal.<ref name=\"Nick\"/> Similarly, Holmes has also connected the theme to Brambleclaw and how nobody knew whether he was good or evil.<ref name=\"FourthChat\" /> A third major theme, often referred to as [[nature versus nurture]], explores whether a person is born the way he or she will be, or if other things shape that. For example, Brambleclaw's father is the evil Tigerstar, but he eventually demonstrates that despite this, he is not evil himself, despite initial suspicion from Clanmates due to his father's legacy. This theme ties into the \"shades of gray\" theme.<ref name=\"Second Chat\" /> similar to the book \u00a8Forest dogs\u00a8.\n\nA reviewer for ''Publishers Weekly'' noted that friendship and responsibility are taught to characters in the novels,<ref name=\"publishers-weekly\"/> while booksforyouths.com had a reviewer who pointed out the idea that, just as Clan cats shun house cats for their soft life, people should realize that it is necessary to experience hardship in life.<ref name=booksforyouths>{{cite web|url=http://booksforyouth.wordpress.com/2009/05/14/into-the-wild-warriors-book-1-by-erin-hunter/|title=booksforyouth Review|date=14 May 2009|publisher=booksforyouth.com|accessdate=20 July 2010}}</ref> A Storysnoops review noted that one of the themes was that \"it doesn't matter where you come from, only who you are inside\".<ref name=\"fireandicereview\">{{cite web|url=http://storysnoops.com/detail.php?id=248|title=Storysnoops Review|publisher=storysnoops.com|accessdate=23 July 2010}}</ref> In ''Dawn'', the importance of cooperation is explored.

The second of two plays by Erin Hunter, ''Brightspirit's Mercy'' is about Jaypaw, Lionblaze, and Hollyleaf. After going to a Gathering, where it is obvious all of the Clans except for ThunderClan are starving, three cats from StarClan appear to them: Brightspirit and her parents, Shiningheart and Braveheart, characters created on ''Wands and Worlds'', a fantasy fiction forum, in memory of a 10-year-old ''Warriors'' fan, Emmy Grace Cherry, and her parents, Dana and Jimmy Cherry, who were killed in a tornado in February 2007.<ref name=brightspirit>{{cite web|url=http://www.brightspiritrelieffund.com|title=Brightspirit Relief Fund|work=IMC studios}}</ref> They tell the three young cats that they must help feed the other Clans. Jaypaw is easily convinced, but Hollyleaf and Lionblaze are harder to win over. Eventually, they agree and hunt, then wait at the WindClan border for a patrol. Ashfoot, WindClan's deputy, accepts the gift, but Breezepaw, too proud to have help from another Clan, refuses to eat it. Jaypaw, Lionblaze, and Hollyleaf then head towards another Clan's territory.<ref name=\"secondplay\">{{cite web|url=http://www.warriorcats.com/data/downloads/brightspirit.pdf|title=''Brightspirit's Mercy''|last=Hunter|first=Erin|accessdate=7 June 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Physical media===\n{{anchor|Trading cards}}\n[[File:Warriors Trading Card.jpg|thumb|175px|Brambleclaw on a Chinese trading card.]]\n\nIn the Chinese translation of the series, \"3-D trading cards\" are packaged in each book.

The Cherokee had tolerated traders but resisted settlers who tried to take over their territory.<ref name=goodspeed/>\n\nThe land directly north of present-day Bradley County was ceded from the Cherokee to the U.S. government in the Calhoun Treaty in 1819. In 1821 the Cherokee Agency&mdash; the official liaison between the U.S. government and the Cherokee Nation&mdash; was moved to the south bank of the [[Hiwassee River]] in present-day [[Charleston, Tennessee|Charleston]], a few miles north of what is now Cleveland.{{sfn|Lillard|1980|p=11}} The [[Indian agent]] was [[Return J.

Headquarters for the removal were established at [[Fort Cass]] in [[Charleston, Tennessee|Charleston]], and, in preparation for the removal, thousands of Cherokees were held in internment camps located between Cleveland and Charleston, including two of the largest at [[Rattlesnake Springs]]. [[Blythe Ferry]], about {{convert|15|mi|km}} northwest of Cleveland in [[Meigs County, Tennessee|Meigs County]], was also an important site during the Cherokee Removal.
