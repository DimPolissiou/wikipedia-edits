He is a genius engineer who built a mechanized suit of armor that replicates [[Superman]]'s powers and bears Superman's logo. Initially, he sought to replace Superman after Superman was killed by Doomsday.  After Superman was resurrected, Superman accepted Steel as a comrade. His real name is John Henry Irons and he wields a sledgehammer&mdash;this is a reference to the mythical railroad worker [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]]. He has a niece named [[Natasha Irons]] who is also a superhero in a similar mechanized suit of armor.\n\n==Publication history==\nFirst appearing in ''[[The Adventures of Superman (comic book)|The Adventures of Superman]]'' #600 (June [[1993 in comics|1993]]), he is the second character known as [[Steel (comics)|Steel]] and was created by [[Louise Simonson]] and artist [[Jon Bogdanove]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1990s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 259 |quote = The issue also featured four teaser comics that introduced a group of contenders all vying for the Superman name...Construction worker John Henry Irons found a new purpose in life as the future Steel in a story by Louise Simonson, with art by Jon Bogdanove.}}</ref> Aspects of the character are clearly inspired by the [[African American]] folk hero [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]], as well as [[Superman]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=steel3 | title=The Unofficial Steel Biography | work=DCU Guide | accessdate=January 28, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | editor1-last=Dooley | editor1-first=Dennis | editor2-last=Engle | editor2-first=Gary | chapter=The Man of Tomorrow and the Boys of Yesterday | title=Superman at Fifty: The Persistence of a Legend | location=New York | publisher=Collier Books | date=October 1988 | isbn=978-0-02-042901-2}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n{{Plot|section|date=June 2010}}\n\n===''The Death of Superman: The Man of Steel''===\n{{Main|The Death of Superman}}\nDoctor John Henry Irons was a brilliant weapons engineer for [[AmerTek|AmerTek Industries]], who eventually became disgusted when the BG-60, a powerful man-portable energy cannon he had designed, fell into the wrong hands and was used to kill innocent people.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=374-376}}</ref> As the company would have coerced him to retain his services, John faked his death, and eventually came to [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]. His own life was saved by none other than Superman. When John Irons asked how he could show his gratitude, Superman told him to \"live a life worth saving\". During Superman's fatal battle against [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], Irons, who was working in construction at the time, attempted to help Superman fight the deadly menace by picking up a sledge hammer, but was buried in rubble amidst the devastation. Shortly after Superman's death, he finally awoke and crawled from the wreckage, confused and saying that he \"must stop Doomsday\".\n\nHe recovered, but to discover that the gangs in inner-city Metropolis (now unopposed by Superman) were fighting a devastating gang war using BG-80 ''Toastmasters'', an upgraded version of his earlier AmerTek design. Irons created and donned a suit of powered armor in Superman's memory in order to stop the war, as well as the weapons, which were being distributed by Dr. Angora Lapin (also known as the White Rabbit), a former partner and lover during his time at [[AmerTek|AmerTek Industries]].\n\n[[File:John Henry Irons.png|thumb|The various incarnations of Steel, on the cover for Superman: The Man of Steel #117. Art by Doug Mahnke.]]\n\nThe \"[[Reign of the Supermen]]\" story arc saw the rise of four \"Supermen\" who were differentiated from each other with nicknames previously applied to Superman; Irons was referred to as the \"Man of Steel\", which was later shortened to \"Steel\" by Superman himself.\n\nAlthough Steel never claimed to be the \"true Superman\", [[Lois Lane]] seriously considered the possibility that he was a [[walk-in]]\u2014someone who was now inhabited by Superman's soul.<ref>[[Roger Stern|Stern, Roger]].

Random House Publishing Group, 1994. p. 365. \"I knew all along that Superman would return, and now he has. Not necessarily in the form people might have expected, but it was him. Listen, have you ever heard of a walk-in spirit? When a body has been  abandoned by one spirit but is not yet uninhabitable, then another spirit can move in. Anyway, whatever he is, the cards tell me for sure that the man who saved me today is definitely the Man of Steel. For sure.\"</ref> Lois met all four \"Supermen\" that appeared after the apparent death of Superman, and while she never concluded that any of them was the one true Superman, she evinced less skepticism of Steel than she did of the others.\n\n===Steel series===\nSteel was spun off into a solo series,<ref>Manning \"1990s\" in Dolan, p. 265: \"Steel finally stepped out of Superman's shadow in his own ongoing series by writers Jon Bogdanove and Louise Simonson, and artist Chris Batista.\"</ref> written by co-creator Louise Simonson and later by [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Christopher Priest]], from 1994\u20131998.\n\nThe series began by having Steel leave Metropolis and return home to [[Washington, D.C.]], revealing that it had been five years since he had left. He erroneously believed that his old employers, AmerTek, would no longer be interested in him. This turned out to be false when they attacked his home. Between this attack and his knowledge that the Toastmasters were now being used on the streets of D.C., he reforged his armor (it was now stronger than ever); he began his crusade against AmerTek, which he correctly knew was responsible for leaking the weapons onto the street. Steel decided not to use the [[Superman logo|\"S\" emblem]], however, since he felt that his battle might take him outside the law.\n\nSteel's family was introduced in this series: his grandparents, Butter and Bess, his sister-in-law Blondell, and her five children: Jemahl, [[Natasha Irons|Natasha]], Paco, Tyke, and Darlene (the latter two being foster children).<ref name=\"Steel #1\">''Steel'' Vol. 2 #1 (February 1994). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nSteel's early adventures pitted him against AmerTek and against the gangs that were using his weapons. His nephew, Jemahl, was involved in one of the gangs, which he thought offered him protection. He was proven wrong, however, when the gangs turned against him to get to Steel. Tyke was paralyzed by a bullet meant for Jemahl and Blondell was assaulted. Steel eventually took down AmerTek and the gangs, and focused on who was helping AmerTek distribute the weapons. This led him to track down a group called Black Ops, led by the villain Hazard.<ref>''Steel'' Vol. 2 #2\u20138 (March\u2013September 1994). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring this time Steel had found romance with Physician [[Amanda Quick (comics)|Amanda Quick]] who treated his nephew '''Jemahl Irons''' (who was the brother to [[Natasha Irons]]), when he got hooked on the superpowered drug '''\"Tar\"'''. She returned John's feelings for her. He shared his identity and adventures with her growing close together and falling in love.<ref>''Steel'' Vol 2 #5</ref><ref>''Steel'' Vol 2 #6.

During this time, Steel developed the ability to teleport his armor onto and off himself. At first, it appeared purely by reflex (whenever he was in mortal danger) but he soon began to better control it, although he had no idea how it happened.<ref>''Steel'' Vol. 2 #11\u201313 (December 1994&nbsp;\u2013 February 1995). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nSteel continued his battle against Hazard's Black Ops and against the return of the White Rabbit. A bounty hunter named Chindi attempted to take down Steel, but after realizing Hazard was experimenting with children, he ended up as an ally of Irons.<ref>''Steel'' Vol. 2 #14\u201319 (March\u2013August 1995). DC Comics.</ref> He was called away from Earth as part of the Superman \"Rescue Squad\" when Superman was [[The Trial of Superman|put on trial for the destruction of]] [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]].<ref>''Steel'' Vol. 2 #22 (November 1995).

Tyke, frustrated and angry over his handicap, revealed Iron's true identity to men working with Hazard. Hazard unleashed a cyborg named Hardwire, who opened fire on the Irons family. Most of them received minor injuries, though Butter was seriously wounded. Child protective services came to reclaim Tyke and Darlene. Tyke was later shown to end up in the custody of Hazard. Hardwire battled Steel at the [[Washington Monument]], resulting in Hardwire's suicide. Steel had to send his armor away to save his life\u2014this resulted in his secret identity being revealed to the world at large. Steel was then taken by Hazard, but managed to escape. Steel retrieved an anti-matter weapon called the Annihilator, which he had designed and hidden years before, for his showdown with Hazard. He also learned at this point that he could teleport himself, not just his armor. He destroyed Hazard and his lair, and apparently killed three young soldiers of Hazard in the battle.<ref>''Steel'' Vol. 2 #23\u201327 (December 1995&nbsp;\u2013 April 1996). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nOnce Steel's identity was out, his family had no peace. They were harassed by neighbors and mobs. Then they were attacked by [[Doctor Polaris]], [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]], and others. John Henry's beloved grandmother, Bess, was killed and the family was forced to go into hiding, relocated by a friend of Steel's called Double.<ref>''Steel'' Vol. 2 #28\u201329 (May\u2013June 1996). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nSteel learned that the three Black Ops agents were not truly killed. They briefly joined him in battling a monstrous, animated form of his armor that attacked him. Steel speculated that the armor came alive because of his own guilt and the strange teleportation effects. He managed to banish the monster and recall his true armor.<ref>''Steel'' Vol. 2 #30\u201331 (July\u2013August 1996). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nThe title received a shakeup when [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Christopher Priest]] became the lead writer for issue #34. Steel relocated to [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], [[New Jersey]] with Natasha and began to work at Garden State Medical Center. He built a new suit of armor that was significantly less powerful than the previous one (but featured the return of an kryptonian peace symbol on his shield on it). While in Jersey City, he clashed with Dennis Samuel Ellis, a resident at Garden State Medical and rival for the affections of another colleague, Amanda Quick. Hospital administrator and gang leader Arthur Villain (pronounced \"Will-hane\") recruited Ellis to become his personal bodyguard. Given a suit with several hidden weapons, Ellis adopted the name \"[[Skorpio (DC Comics)|Skorpio]]\" and became a recurring nemesis for Steel. Eventually Steel was reunited with his brother Clay, a hitman whom everyone assumed had been killed. Clay assumed the alias \"Crash\" and managed to acquire a pair of Steel's flightboots before turning himself in so that he could save his daughter Natasha when she needed a blood transfusion. The series was canceled after issue #52, which featured Steel running the hospital after the unmasking of its previous coordinator, Villain.\n\n===Worlds Collide===\nDuring the ''[[Worlds Collide (comics)|Worlds Collide]]'' crossover series between DC and [[Milestone Media]], Steel encountered his Milestone counterpart [[Hardware (comics) |Hardware]]. Each hero questioned the other's motivations, Steel believing Hardware to be too rebellious and Hardware believing Steel to be too trusting and naive.\n\n===JLA and the Men of Steel===\nAround the time the Steel series was cancelled, Steel was recruited as a member of the Justice League, due to [[Batman]]'s concern that the League was already top-heavy in brawn and required more thinkers. During his time in the League, Steel played a crucial role in the defeat of villains such as [[Prometheus (DC Comics) |Prometheus]] and the [[Queen Bee (comics) |Queen Bee]]. He even served as the leader of the reserve team\u2014consisting of [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli) |Huntress]], [[Big Barda|Barda]], [[Plastic Man]], and [[Zauriel]]\u2014left in the present during the [[DC One Million]] crisis. Following the battle against [[Mageddon]], he ceased to serve as a full-time member of the League, although he stayed on as a supporting member for quite some time. He also became a regular member in the Superman titles, having relocated with Nat to Metropolis to run his own workshop there, called \"Steelworks.\" He also revealed at this time that he had known Superman's identity for some time. The two became partners of a sort, and John Henry helped Superman build a new [[Fortress of Solitude]], although he maintained some contacts with the Justice League, as shown when he was able to contact Batman to help Superman find [[Lois Lane]] after she had been abducted by the [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]].\n\nSteel retired from active duty during the [[Imperiex]] War after he was injured while wearing the Entropy Aegis, an alien armor created on the evil planet [[Apokolips]]; it nearly consumed his \"soul\" after he was taken by the [[Black Racer (DC Comics) |Black Racer]] while attempting to release [[Doomsday (comics) |Doomsday]] and use him against Imperiex. Superman eventually confronted Darkseid in single combat with the aid of the rest of the Superman family to keep Darkseid's other forces delayed, requesting only that Darkseid release Irons from the Entropy Aegis after his defeat in exchange for him never sharing the results of this battle with anyone, although they had to rush Irons back to Earth for urgent medical attention as he was restored in the same physical state he'd been in when he was placed in the armor, and it was speculated that the injuries would prevent him ever becoming Steel again.\n\n===Retirement===\nDuring his retirement, Irons made a suit of armor for his niece [[Natasha Irons|Natasha]], who became the new Steel. Although he was no longer actively fighting crime, he remained an important ally of Superman. He unintentionally usurped the position of [[Professor Hamilton|Emil Hamilton]] as Superman's technology guru, one of several developments that led to the emergence of Ruin.\n\n===''52''===\n{{Main|52 (comics)}}\nJohn Henry Irons donned his armor once more in the wake of the Battle of Metropolis during ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''. Along with most of Earth's united heroes, Steel helped defeat the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] in Metropolis, but became bitter with life and a perceived narcissism within Earth's superhero community. After the disaster, John baited [[Natasha Irons |Natasha]] into an argument in which he prevented her from leaving Metropolis to join the [[Teen Titans]]. Irons refused to let her go and ordered her to continue collecting all the debris in the city, culminating in him destroying her armor in spite.\n\nHe later identified a recently discovered corpse as that of a [[Lex Luthor]] from a parallel universe, [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]], exonerating the real Lex Luthor from all of his recent crimes.\n\nA week later, at his Steelworks facilities, John Henry appeared to be hallucinating due to the effects of an unknown metabolic [[toxin]]. His flesh seemed to be in the middle of transforming into metal just before the lab exploded.\n\nThree days later, Steel, again wearing his armor, was called in by [[Doctor Mid-Nite]] to help him with the wounded heroes returned from space after the Crisis. He used ''Pseudocytes'' to aid in [[Mal Duncan]]'s recovery.\n\nWith the help of Kala Avasti from [[S.T.A.R. Labs]], Irons learned that he had been injected with a small dosage of Lex Luthor's new  exo-gene therapy, causing his skin to mutate into stainless steel and back again. He returned to Steelworks to find Natasha attempting, and failing, to build a new suit. Unaware of the truth, she accused him of hypocrisy for accepting Lex's exo-gene treatment.\n\nThree days and two nights later, Irons appeared, transformed into a man of living steel, at a party held by Lex Luthor. In a rage, he attacked Luthor, demanding to see Natasha and threatening or endangering anyone who got in his way. However, Natasha herself soon appeared, to stop John before he could kill Luthor. Natasha then single handedly beat the enraged John until he came to his senses. He admitted that Natasha was right to stop him from killing Luthor, but maintained that he was right, too. He then asked Natasha to \"give it up, come home\". Natasha responded by punching John repeatedly and sending him flying into the Metropolis bay.\n\nHe reappeared several weeks later, having built a new suit of armor for Natasha, to make up for his behavior toward her, but had an emotional breakdown on realizing that it was too late to make amends.\n\nHe later returned to active duty saving lives, and discovered from Kala that the exo-gene therapy allowed Luthor to take away any powers he had given. He then shared his suspicions with the [[Teen Titans]] and a former test subject who had had his powers stripped away.\n\nInvestigating the Everyman Project on [[Thanksgiving]] along with [[Doctor Mid-Nite]], [[Beast Boy|Beast Boy/Changeling]], and Kala, John discovered that his metal skin was peeling off and realized that the exo-gene therapy granted powers only for a limited time before they disappear completely.\n\nIn ''52'' Week 40, after Natasha's capture by Luthor, Irons, in his full armor, led the Teen Titans\u2014[[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]](Daughter of Trigon, The lord of the Underworld) [[Beast Boy|Beast Boy/Changeling]], Aquagirl, and [[Offspring (comics) |Offspring]]\u2014in an open assault on [[LexCorp]]. After defeating armed robot guards and [[Infinity, Inc.]], Irons, with his armor destroyed, engaged Luthor in battle. But Luthor, having gained similar abilities to Superman's, thrashes Irons. Natasha used Irons' sledgehammer to create an [[electromagnetic pulse]] that shut down Luthor's exo-gene, and Irons defeated him.<ref>''52'' Week 40 (February 7, 2007). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nIn ''52'' Week 47, John and Natasha reestablished Steelworks.\n\n===Infinity, Inc.===\n{{Main|Infinity, Inc.}}\nSteel was one of the main characters of the ''Infinity Inc.'' vol. 2 series, which debuted in September 2007.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=105423 | title=Update 2: DC Nation Panel From WW:LA | work=[[Newsarama]] | date=March 16, 2007 | accessdate=January 28, 2011}}</ref> A year after the end of the Every-man Project. Natasha is living with her uncle John Henry Irons and is in psychotherapy along with Erik, who refers to it as \"our national religion\" and Gerome. Another long-term patient, teenager Dale Smith, attacks his therapist and realizes his powers as a psychic vampire. Smith takes the name \"Kid Empty\". Apparently, a side effect of the exo-gene therapy is that once the exo-gene itself is suppressed, the energies unleashed by the therapy remains, re-enabling the metagene in a different fashion. As a result, Natasha finds herself turning to a mist-like substance, McKenna gains the ability to duplicate himself, and Storm gains a powerhouse, overconfident, female alter-ego. The group gains new members in Mercy Graves and Lucia, an Every-man subject who can psychically inflict pain on others. In issue #8, the team gains official costumes and code names, and go on their first mission.\n\nUpon the much solicited ending for the series,<ref>''Infinity Inc.'' vol. 2, #12 (October 2008). DC Comics.</ref> the Infinitors are kidnapped by the [[Dark Side Club]], as due to the exo-gene therapy, they're unpredictable and undetectable by Apokoliptan technology, and a wild card in the upcoming [[Final Crisis]]. Irons vows to scour the Earth for his niece.\n\nIn recent months, Irons has been working with [[Batman|Bruce Wayne/Batman]], [[Zatanna]], [[Mister Miracle]], the [[Metal Men]], and assorted other technical geniuses in creating a new body for [[Red Tornado]]. Unfortunately the [[Amazo]] program infected the new body. Working together, Wayne and Irons used the Justice League of America's teleportation doorways to send Amazo (an android with the power to use other people's powers) into a red sun, after which they completed a new body for the Red Tornado (an android with the power to make gusts of wind come out of his arms and torso).\n\nWhen [[Clock King]] takes over the Dark Side Club from [[Darkseid]], he \"inherits\" the imprisoned Infinitors, so, when the Dark Side Club is finally destroyed, [[Miss Martian]] sends a \"brain mail\" to Irons, who comes to free his niece, and finally reunites with her.\n\n===''Superman''===\nJohn Henry Irons has made multiple appearances in the regular ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' series by [[James Robinson (comics)|James Robinson]].<ref>''Superman'' #686\u2013687 (May\u2013June 2009).

Steel modified his suit many times through his career. The initial \"Man of Steel\" design was armed with a wrist-mounted [[rivet]] gun and the sledgehammer (like the one used by his namesake [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]]) that was ubiquitous for most of his designs. The original design on his breastplate featured a metal version of Superman's \"S\" insignia in tribute to the (temporarily) deceased hero, which Irons removed after the return of Superman. Two later armor designs incorporated a similar, but different, \"S\" symbol. A large hammer is also a key weapon in the suit's arsenal. His most current \"smart hammer\" hits harder the farther it is thrown, is capable of independent flight, and has an on-board computer guidance and analysis system capable of detecting a target's stress points.\n\nWhen he wore the Entropy Aegis, he had god-like strength and durability and could enlarge himself to giant size. He also had the ability of flight due to energy wings, could travel through time and space at will, and could fire blasts of energy that would reduce a target to its composite elements. However, the Aegis made him very violent and was slowly erasing his soul.\n\nDuring the 52 event, John Henry Irons was altered by the ''Everyman Project'' and had become composed of [[stainless steel]] due to [[Lex Luthor]] tampering with John's DNA without John's consent. Steel's strength and durability were now on a superhuman level. In addition, he could generate enough heat to turn metal fluid (including his own body, which he can then drip off of himself in small amounts). In ''52'' Week 29, the metal skin peeled off completely, leaving him, again, a normal human. He has since returned to using powered armor of a design similar to his original \"Man of Steel\" armor.\n\n==Enemies==\n{{expand section|date=December 2019}}\nSteel had his own enemies that he fought in his comic series:\n\n* '''Alter''' - A [[detective]] that developed the ability to turn into a hulking monster with super-strength, claws, and invulnerability.

John Henry Irons is a designer for [[LexCorp]] who works to create a prototype suit of powered armor for the [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] SCU, but the suit's [[brain\u2013computer interface|neural interface]] system had adverse psychological effects on its user Sgt. Corey Mills. Encouraged by Superman, Irons worked to perfect the suit with the help of his niece Natasha, becoming the superhero Steel just in time to help Superman in a battle against [[Metallo]]. The animated Steel is missing the cape he adapted from Superman after he saved John's life in ''[[Superman: The Man of Steel]]'' #19, and lacks his 'S' shield (although he does wear a jersey with a 5 on the front, a possible homage). In his premiere episode \"Heavy Metal\", his rivet guns were replaced with forearm-mounted lasers.\n* Steel appeared in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', voiced by an uncredited [[Phil LaMarr]]. He is seen as a member of the expanded Justice League. Steel has appeared regularly in the company of Superman and [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]].

He is saved by Supergirl's arrival, and after Galatea's defeat Supergirl escorts him to safety.\n* Steel was originally slated to appear in Season 2 of ''[[Justice League: Gods and Monsters Chronicles]]'', before the series was cancelled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vcpost.com/articles/64841/20150507/justice-league-gods-and-monsters-chronicles-update-mary-marvel-green-lantern-season-2-debut-2016.htm|title='Justice League: Gods and Monsters Chronicles' Update: Mary Marvel, Green Lantern To Be Added in the Season 2 to debut in 2016|work=Venture Capital Post|date=2015-05-07}}</ref>\n* Steel appears in ''[[Young Justice: Outsiders]]'', voiced by [[Zeno Robinson]], as a member of the Justice League.\n\n===Film===\n\n[[File:Steelposter.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shaquille O'Neal]] as Steel]]\n* In [[1997 in film|1997]], a [[feature film]] was produced based on this version of the character. The film ''[[Steel (1997 film)|Steel]]'' stars professional basketball player [[Shaquille O'Neal]] in the title role and [[Judd Nelson]] as a new villain named Nathaniel Burke. The film was originally designed to be a spin-off of the new [[Superman in film|Superman film]] that used the \"[[The Death of Superman|Death of Superman]]\" storyline that first introduced the character in the comics, but ultimately became divorced from the Superman mythos. The project languished in [[development hell]] for so long, the spin-off moved forward without the film it was to be attached to. The movie (released on August 15) was considered a flop both critically and financially. ''Steel'' was produced for an estimated $16,000,000 but grossed $1,686,429 at the box office.\n* A very young John Henry Irons appears in the animated film ''[[Justice League: The New Frontier]]'' reading a comic book near the gravestone of the \"DC: The New Frontier\" version of John Wilson, also known as John Henry, who is reportedly killed in the film.\n* An alternate universe version of John Henry Irons appears in ''[[Justice League: Gods and Monsters]]'', voiced by [[Khary Payton]].

When the \"Death of Superman\" story arc happened in the comics, Maggs presented a very faithful, though much pared down version of the tale, which featured [[Stuart Milligan]] as Clark Kent/Superman, [[Lorelei King]] as Lois Lane, and [[William Hootkins]] as Lex Luthor. John Henry Irons was played by film actor [[Leon Hebert]], who coincidentally appeared as a reporter in [[Tim Burton]]'s first [[Batman]] movie.

His own life was saved by none other than Superman. When John Irons asked how he could show his gratitude, Superman told him to \"live a life worth saving\". During Superman's fatal battle against [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], Irons, who was working in construction at the time, attempted to help Superman fight the deadly menace by picking up a sledge hammer, but was buried in rubble amidst the devastation. Shortly after Superman's death, he finally awoke and crawled from the wreckage, confused and saying that he \"must stop Doomsday\".\n\nHe recovered, but to discover that the gangs in inner-city Metropolis (now unopposed by Superman) were fighting a devastating gang war using BG-80 ''Toastmasters'', an upgraded version of his earlier AmerTek design. Irons created and donned a suit of powered armor in Superman's memory in order to stop the war, as well as the weapons, which were being distributed by Dr. Angora Lapin (also known as the White Rabbit), a former partner and lover during his time at [[AmerTek|AmerTek Industries]].\n\n[[File:John Henry Irons.png|thumb|The various incarnations of Steel, on the cover for Superman: The Man of Steel #117.

For sure.\"</ref> Lois met all four \"Supermen\" that appeared after the apparent death of Superman, and while she never concluded that any of them was the one true Superman, she evinced less skepticism of Steel than she did of the others.\n\n===Steel series===\nSteel was spun off into a solo series,<ref>Manning \"1990s\" in Dolan, p. 265: \"Steel finally stepped out of Superman's shadow in his own ongoing series by writers Jon Bogdanove and Louise Simonson, and artist Chris Batista.\"</ref> written by co-creator Louise Simonson and later by [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Christopher Priest]], from 1994\u20131998.\n\nThe series began by having Steel leave Metropolis and return home to [[Washington, D.C.]], revealing that it had been five years since he had left. He erroneously believed that his old employers, AmerTek, would no longer be interested in him. This turned out to be false when they attacked his home. Between this attack and his knowledge that the Toastmasters were now being used on the streets of D.C., he reforged his armor (it was now stronger than ever); he began his crusade against AmerTek, which he correctly knew was responsible for leaking the weapons onto the street. Steel decided not to use the [[Superman logo|\"S\" emblem]], however, since he felt that his battle might take him outside the law.\n\nSteel's family was introduced in this series: his grandparents, Butter and Bess, his sister-in-law Blondell, and her five children: Jemahl, [[Natasha Irons|Natasha]], Paco, Tyke, and Darlene (the latter two being foster children).<ref name=\"Steel #1\">''Steel'' Vol. 2 #1 (February 1994). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nSteel's early adventures pitted him against AmerTek and against the gangs that were using his weapons. His nephew, Jemahl, was involved in one of the gangs, which he thought offered him protection. He was proven wrong, however, when the gangs turned against him to get to Steel. Tyke was paralyzed by a bullet meant for Jemahl and Blondell was assaulted. Steel eventually took down AmerTek and the gangs, and focused on who was helping AmerTek distribute the weapons. This led him to track down a group called Black Ops, led by the villain Hazard.<ref>''Steel'' Vol. 2 #2\u20138 (March\u2013September 1994).

During this time, Steel developed the ability to teleport his armor onto and off himself.

Tyke, frustrated and angry over his handicap, revealed Iron's true identity to men working with Hazard. Hazard unleashed a cyborg named Hardwire, who opened fire on the Irons family. Most of them received minor injuries, though Butter was seriously wounded. Child protective services came to reclaim Tyke and Darlene. Tyke was later shown to end up in the custody of Hazard. Hardwire battled Steel at the [[Washington Monument]], resulting in Hardwire's suicide. Steel had to send his armor away to save his life\u2014this resulted in his secret identity being revealed to the world at large. Steel was then taken by Hazard, but managed to escape. Steel retrieved an anti-matter weapon called the Annihilator, which he had designed and hidden years before, for his showdown with Hazard. He also learned at this point that he could teleport himself, not just his armor. He destroyed Hazard and his lair, and apparently killed three young soldiers of Hazard in the battle.<ref>''Steel'' Vol. 2 #23\u201327 (December 1995&nbsp;\u2013 April 1996).

DC Comics.</ref>\n\nSteel learned that the three Black Ops agents were not truly killed. They briefly joined him in battling a monstrous, animated form of his armor that attacked him. Steel speculated that the armor came alive because of his own guilt and the strange teleportation effects. He managed to banish the monster and recall his true armor.<ref>''Steel'' Vol. 2 #30\u201331 (July\u2013August 1996). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nThe title received a shakeup when [[Christopher Priest (comics)|Christopher Priest]] became the lead writer for issue #34. Steel relocated to [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], [[New Jersey]] with Natasha and began to work at Garden State Medical Center. He built a new suit of armor that was significantly less powerful than the previous one (but featured the return of an kryptonian peace symbol on his shield on it). While in Jersey City, he clashed with Dennis Samuel Ellis, a resident at Garden State Medical and rival for the affections of another colleague, Amanda Quick. Hospital administrator and gang leader Arthur Villain (pronounced \"Will-hane\") recruited Ellis to become his personal bodyguard. Given a suit with several hidden weapons, Ellis adopted the name \"[[Skorpio (DC Comics)|Skorpio]]\" and became a recurring nemesis for Steel. Eventually Steel was reunited with his brother Clay, a hitman whom everyone assumed had been killed. Clay assumed the alias \"Crash\" and managed to acquire a pair of Steel's flightboots before turning himself in so that he could save his daughter Natasha when she needed a blood transfusion. The series was canceled after issue #52, which featured Steel running the hospital after the unmasking of its previous coordinator, Villain.\n\n===Worlds Collide===\nDuring the ''[[Worlds Collide (comics)|Worlds Collide]]'' crossover series between DC and [[Milestone Media]], Steel encountered his Milestone counterpart [[Hardware (comics) |Hardware]]. Each hero questioned the other's motivations, Steel believing Hardware to be too rebellious and Hardware believing Steel to be too trusting and naive.\n\n===JLA and the Men of Steel===\nAround the time the Steel series was cancelled, Steel was recruited as a member of the Justice League, due to [[Batman]]'s concern that the League was already top-heavy in brawn and required more thinkers. During his time in the League, Steel played a crucial role in the defeat of villains such as [[Prometheus (DC Comics) |Prometheus]] and the [[Queen Bee (comics) |Queen Bee]]. He even served as the leader of the reserve team\u2014consisting of [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli) |Huntress]], [[Big Barda|Barda]], [[Plastic Man]], and [[Zauriel]]\u2014left in the present during the [[DC One Million]] crisis. Following the battle against [[Mageddon]], he ceased to serve as a full-time member of the League, although he stayed on as a supporting member for quite some time. He also became a regular member in the Superman titles, having relocated with Nat to Metropolis to run his own workshop there, called \"Steelworks.\" He also revealed at this time that he had known Superman's identity for some time. The two became partners of a sort, and John Henry helped Superman build a new [[Fortress of Solitude]], although he maintained some contacts with the Justice League, as shown when he was able to contact Batman to help Superman find [[Lois Lane]] after she had been abducted by the [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]].\n\nSteel retired from active duty during the [[Imperiex]] War after he was injured while wearing the Entropy Aegis, an alien armor created on the evil planet [[Apokolips]]; it nearly consumed his \"soul\" after he was taken by the [[Black Racer (DC Comics) |Black Racer]] while attempting to release [[Doomsday (comics) |Doomsday]] and use him against Imperiex. Superman eventually confronted Darkseid in single combat with the aid of the rest of the Superman family to keep Darkseid's other forces delayed, requesting only that Darkseid release Irons from the Entropy Aegis after his defeat in exchange for him never sharing the results of this battle with anyone, although they had to rush Irons back to Earth for urgent medical attention as he was restored in the same physical state he'd been in when he was placed in the armor, and it was speculated that the injuries would prevent him ever becoming Steel again.\n\n===Retirement===\nDuring his retirement, Irons made a suit of armor for his niece [[Natasha Irons|Natasha]], who became the new Steel. Although he was no longer actively fighting crime, he remained an important ally of Superman. He unintentionally usurped the position of [[Professor Hamilton|Emil Hamilton]] as Superman's technology guru, one of several developments that led to the emergence of Ruin.\n\n===''52''===\n{{Main|52 (comics)}}\nJohn Henry Irons donned his armor once more in the wake of the Battle of Metropolis during ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''. Along with most of Earth's united heroes, Steel helped defeat the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] in Metropolis, but became bitter with life and a perceived narcissism within Earth's superhero community. After the disaster, John baited [[Natasha Irons |Natasha]] into an argument in which he prevented her from leaving Metropolis to join the [[Teen Titans]]. Irons refused to let her go and ordered her to continue collecting all the debris in the city, culminating in him destroying her armor in spite.\n\nHe later identified a recently discovered corpse as that of a [[Lex Luthor]] from a parallel universe, [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]], exonerating the real Lex Luthor from all of his recent crimes.\n\nA week later, at his Steelworks facilities, John Henry appeared to be hallucinating due to the effects of an unknown metabolic [[toxin]]. His flesh seemed to be in the middle of transforming into metal just before the lab exploded.\n\nThree days later, Steel, again wearing his armor, was called in by [[Doctor Mid-Nite]] to help him with the wounded heroes returned from space after the Crisis. He used ''Pseudocytes'' to aid in [[Mal Duncan]]'s recovery.\n\nWith the help of Kala Avasti from [[S.T.A.R. Labs]], Irons learned that he had been injected with a small dosage of Lex Luthor's new  exo-gene therapy, causing his skin to mutate into stainless steel and back again. He returned to Steelworks to find Natasha attempting, and failing, to build a new suit. Unaware of the truth, she accused him of hypocrisy for accepting Lex's exo-gene treatment.\n\nThree days and two nights later, Irons appeared, transformed into a man of living steel, at a party held by Lex Luthor. In a rage, he attacked Luthor, demanding to see Natasha and threatening or endangering anyone who got in his way. However, Natasha herself soon appeared, to stop John before he could kill Luthor. Natasha then single handedly beat the enraged John until he came to his senses. He admitted that Natasha was right to stop him from killing Luthor, but maintained that he was right, too. He then asked Natasha to \"give it up, come home\". Natasha responded by punching John repeatedly and sending him flying into the Metropolis bay.\n\nHe reappeared several weeks later, having built a new suit of armor for Natasha, to make up for his behavior toward her, but had an emotional breakdown on realizing that it was too late to make amends.\n\nHe later returned to active duty saving lives, and discovered from Kala that the exo-gene therapy allowed Luthor to take away any powers he had given. He then shared his suspicions with the [[Teen Titans]] and a former test subject who had had his powers stripped away.\n\nInvestigating the Everyman Project on [[Thanksgiving]] along with [[Doctor Mid-Nite]], [[Beast Boy|Beast Boy/Changeling]], and Kala, John discovered that his metal skin was peeling off and realized that the exo-gene therapy granted powers only for a limited time before they disappear completely.\n\nIn ''52'' Week 40, after Natasha's capture by Luthor, Irons, in his full armor, led the Teen Titans\u2014[[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]](Daughter of Trigon, The lord of the Underworld) [[Beast Boy|Beast Boy/Changeling]], Aquagirl, and [[Offspring (comics) |Offspring]]\u2014in an open assault on [[LexCorp]]. After defeating armed robot guards and [[Infinity, Inc.]], Irons, with his armor destroyed, engaged Luthor in battle. But Luthor, having gained similar abilities to Superman's, thrashes Irons. Natasha used Irons' sledgehammer to create an [[electromagnetic pulse]] that shut down Luthor's exo-gene, and Irons defeated him.<ref>''52'' Week 40 (February 7, 2007).

Natasha is living with her uncle John Henry Irons and is in psychotherapy along with Erik, who refers to it as \"our national religion\" and Gerome. Another long-term patient, teenager Dale Smith, attacks his therapist and realizes his powers as a psychic vampire. Smith takes the name \"Kid Empty\". Apparently, a side effect of the exo-gene therapy is that once the exo-gene itself is suppressed, the energies unleashed by the therapy remains, re-enabling the metagene in a different fashion. As a result, Natasha finds herself turning to a mist-like substance, McKenna gains the ability to duplicate himself, and Storm gains a powerhouse, overconfident, female alter-ego. The group gains new members in Mercy Graves and Lucia, an Every-man subject who can psychically inflict pain on others. In issue #8, the team gains official costumes and code names, and go on their first mission.\n\nUpon the much solicited ending for the series,<ref>''Infinity Inc.'' vol. 2, #12 (October 2008).

Irons vows to scour the Earth for his niece.\n\nIn recent months, Irons has been working with [[Batman|Bruce Wayne/Batman]], [[Zatanna]], [[Mister Miracle]], the [[Metal Men]], and assorted other technical geniuses in creating a new body for [[Red Tornado]]. Unfortunately the [[Amazo]] program infected the new body. Working together, Wayne and Irons used the Justice League of America's teleportation doorways to send Amazo (an android with the power to use other people's powers) into a red sun, after which they completed a new body for the Red Tornado (an android with the power to make gusts of wind come out of his arms and torso).\n\nWhen [[Clock King]] takes over the Dark Side Club from [[Darkseid]], he \"inherits\" the imprisoned Infinitors, so, when the Dark Side Club is finally destroyed, [[Miss Martian]] sends a \"brain mail\" to Irons, who comes to free his niece, and finally reunites with her.\n\n===''Superman''===\nJohn Henry Irons has made multiple appearances in the regular ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' series by [[James Robinson (comics)|James Robinson]].<ref>''Superman'' #686\u2013687 (May\u2013June 2009).

During the battle, Doomsday inexplicably develops metallic armor and the power of flight, countering Steel's own abilities. Steel attempts to immobilize Doomsday with nanites, but he quickly overcomes them, and badly beats him. Doomsday then picks up Steel's prone form and flies off with him.<ref>''Reign of Doomsday: Steel'' (March 2011)</ref> When Steel awakens to find himself in a dimensional prison with Superboy, Supergirl, the Eradicator, and Hank Henshaw/Cyborg Superman all of whom have been captured by Doomsday, he speculates that Henshaw was included in the group to keep them divided and prevent them working together to find a way of escaping. Their subsequent exploration of their prison reveals that they were actually captured by clones of Doomsday created by [[Lex Luthor]] to distract Earth's heroes while he sought the power of the [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern Ring]](The Lantern of Death) each Doomsday clone designed to eliminate the Superman it was sent after.<ref>''Action Comics'' #900. DC Comics.</ref>\n\n===The New 52===\nIn September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, John Henry Irons first appears in [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[Action Comics]]'' as a young scientist working on the government's \"Steel Soldier\" program. He retaliates after seeing the mistreatment of Superman by Lex Luthor (who was under the command of General Sam Lane to torture him). Irons immediately quits.<ref>''Action Comics'' vol. 2, #2 (October 2011).

Steel modified his suit many times through his career. The initial \"Man of Steel\" design was armed with a wrist-mounted [[rivet]] gun and the sledgehammer (like the one used by his namesake [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]]) that was ubiquitous for most of his designs. The original design on his breastplate featured a metal version of Superman's \"S\" insignia in tribute to the (temporarily) deceased hero, which Irons removed after the return of Superman. Two later armor designs incorporated a similar, but different, \"S\" symbol. A large hammer is also a key weapon in the suit's arsenal. His most current \"smart hammer\" hits harder the farther it is thrown, is capable of independent flight, and has an on-board computer guidance and analysis system capable of detecting a target's stress points.\n\nWhen he wore the Entropy Aegis, he had god-like strength and durability and could enlarge himself to giant size. He also had the ability of flight due to energy wings, could travel through time and space at will, and could fire blasts of energy that would reduce a target to its composite elements. However, the Aegis made him very violent and was slowly erasing his soul.\n\nDuring the 52 event, John Henry Irons was altered by the ''Everyman Project'' and had become composed of [[stainless steel]] due to [[Lex Luthor]] tampering with John's DNA without John's consent. Steel's strength and durability were now on a superhuman level. In addition, he could generate enough heat to turn metal fluid (including his own body, which he can then drip off of himself in small amounts). In ''52'' Week 29, the metal skin peeled off completely, leaving him, again, a normal human. He has since returned to using powered armor of a design similar to his original \"Man of Steel\" armor.\n\n==Enemies==\n{{expand section|date=December 2019}}\nSteel had his own enemies that he fought in his comic series:\n\n* '''Alter''' - A [[detective]] that developed the ability to turn into a hulking monster with super-strength, claws, and invulnerability.

It's very bubblegum, but that isn't really all that surprising given Miranda's good girl image and Nickelodeon backing. It's also the only track on the album that she had a hand in writing, so it was a good decision for a single. It allows the record label to see how her fans respond to her music, gauge whether or not they should have more of her own writing on her next album. And it's a good effort for her first released song, though I think it's got some of the weakest vocals on the CD. She'll probably do a lot of cowriting with much more experienced musicians the next time around, which will help her grow as a singer/songwriter if she chooses to continue pursuing music.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portraitmagazine.net/reviews/albums/sparksfly.html |title=Miranda Cosgrove: Sparks Fly Reviews - Portrait Reviews |publisher=Portraitmagazine.net |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\nJ!-ENT reviewed the song, stating the song is \"well-produced, well-sung and has that sing/song style similar to [[Taylor Swift]] but with a rock edge\".

It's very bubblegum, but that isn't really all that surprising given Miranda's good girl image and Nickelodeon backing. It's also the only track on the album that she had a hand in writing, so it was a good decision for a single. It allows the record label to see how her fans respond to her music, gauge whether or not they should have more of her own writing on her next album. And it's a good effort for her first released song, though I think it's got some of the weakest vocals on the CD. She'll probably do a lot of cowriting with much more experienced musicians the next time around, which will help her grow as a singer/songwriter if she chooses to continue pursuing music.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portraitmagazine.net/reviews/albums/sparksfly.html |title=Miranda Cosgrove: Sparks Fly Reviews - Portrait Reviews |publisher=Portraitmagazine.net |date= |accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\nJ!-ENT reviewed the song, stating the song is \"well-produced, well-sung and has that sing/song style similar to [[Taylor Swift]] but with a rock edge\".

While Cosgrove is fitting into the pop/rock vibe, if a young pop/rock number is what you want, Disney's [[Demi Lovato]] has far more substance.. and range. Kissin' U plays it safe, and should go on to be a moderate hit, but doesn't break any new ground.
