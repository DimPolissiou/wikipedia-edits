He holds the record for most Test innings without registering a duck (78),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.howstat.com/cricket/Statistics/Batting/BattingDucks4.asp |title=Players Batting 30 Innings before First Duck |website=Howstat |access-date=27 November 2008}}</ref> before being dismissed for nought against [[Bangladesh national cricket team|Bangladesh]] in November 2008. He also holds the second-highest individual score by a South African batsman, with 278 (not out). Until 2012 he was an occasional [[wicket-keeper]] for South Africa, although after the retirement of regular Test keeper [[Mark Boucher]] and under his own captaincy he has started to regularly keep wicket for the national side in Tests, ODIs and T20Is. He gave up wicket-keeping in 2015 and handed the gloves to [[debutant]] [[Quinton de Kock]].\n\nHe holds the records for the fastest 50 (16 balls), 100 (31 balls) and 150 (64 balls) of all time in One Day Internationals by any batsmen, and also holds the fastest hundred by a South African in Tests and the fastest 50 by South African in T20Is. He is a three-time ICC ODI player of the year, winning the award in 2010, 2014 and 2015.\n\nAfter the [[2011 Cricket World Cup]] he succeeded [[Graeme Smith]] as captain of the national ODI side, and became Test captain after the second Test of the [[English cricket team in South Africa in 2015\u201316|home series against England in 2015/16]]. He stepped down from Test captaincy in December 2016 due to an elbow injury which kept him out of the team for a long period.\n\n==International career==\n[[File:AB de villiers (cropped).jpg|thumb|252px|De Villiers in 2006]]\n\n===Early career===\nAfter a spell in the South Africa U19 team, he made his debut for the Titans in 2003/4.\n\nHe made his Test debut as a 20-year-old on 16 December 2004 against England at Port Elizabeth. He made a strong impression opening the batting, but was dropped down the order for the second Test and also handed the wicket-keeping gloves. In this match, he made a match-saving half-century from number seven. However, he found himself at the top of the order again for the final Test of the series.\n\nDespite a good tour of the Caribbean where he scored 178 to help South Africa seal a Test series win, his rapid progress was slowed on the [[South African cricket team in Australia in 2005-06|tour of Australia]] in 2005. Despite playing [[Shane Warne]] well and becoming the second-youngest and second-fastest South African to reach 1,000 Test runs after [[Graeme Pollock]], he struggled and made just 152 runs in 6 innings.\n\nHe has been used in a similar fashion to [[Jonty Rhodes]] in ODIs, opening the innings, although he currently bats in the middle order. De Villiers gave the selectors a sign by producing his then highest one-day score of 92 not out, which included 12 fours and one six, from 98 balls against India in the 2006 winter series.\n\nDe Villiers had a reputation as an outstanding fielder, typified by a diving run-out of [[Simon Katich]] of Australia in 2006, when he dived to stop the ball, and while still lying on his stomach facing away from the stumps, he tossed the ball backwards over his shoulder and effected a direct hit. This has also led people to make further comparisons of him to Jonty Rhodes, who was also one of the finest fielders of his generation. His fielding positions other than wicket-keeper are 1st and 2nd slip and cover.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH8KrkRYIQA |title=Ponting's Top Five fielders of all time |author=Cricket.com.au |date=21 May 2017 |website=YouTube |accessdate=27 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===2007 Cricket World Cup in West Indies===\nCompeting in the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]], AB was in good form in ODIs having scored four 50s during the South Africa vs India/Pakistan (2007) matches.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn the early stages of the tournament AB's form was poor with three failures including a duck against the [[Netherlands national cricket team|Netherlands]] in a match where his team broke various records for batting,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wc2007/content/story/285626.html?object=247462 |title=Gibbs sets records galore |first1=S. |last1=Rajesh |first2=H.

This was followed by a 97 at [[The Oval]] before he came down the wicket trying to smash [[Monty Panesar]] for a boundary and was caught on the fence.\n\nIn the first Test in Perth, De Villiers scored a match-winning century to help South Africa chase down the second-highest-ever fourth innings target of 414 with six wickets in hand. This was South Africa's first Test victory in Australia in 15 years and appeared to go a long way towards tilting world cricket's balance of power after over a decade of Australian dominance. De Villiers also took four diving catches in the course of the match, including one to dismiss [[Jason Krejza]], a stunner at backward point.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://content-nz.cricinfo.com/ausvrsa2008_09/engine/match/351681.html |title=1st Test Australia v South Africa at Perth, 17\u201321 December 2008 |website=ESPNcricinfo |access-date=21 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nDe Villiers only scored 11 runs in the second Test at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] and made another low score in the first innings of the final Test at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]].

But in the second innings he made only 3 off 7.\n\nIn the third Test, after centuries from [[Ashwell Prince]] and Jacques Kallis, De Villiers was the third centurion of the innings with a score of 163 off 196 balls with 12 fours and 7 sixes. This knock also tied the record for most sixes in an over as De Villiers, off the bowling of McDonald, hit four consecutive sixes.\n\nIn the following 5-game ODI series, De Villiers played consistently, although starting badly in the first game, scoring only 2 runs. However, he went on to make 36*, 80, 84 and 38 and was named Player of the Series at the conclusion of game 5.\n\nHe was rested for the two-match Twenty20 series against Zimbabwe and because [[Mark Boucher]] was injured as well [[Heino Kuhn]] donned the keeping gloves. De Villiers returned for the ODI series and also took over the gloves while Boucher was recovering. He did well against Zimbabwe scoring two centuries out of the three ODIs as South Africa comfortably won the three match series 3\u20130.\n\nHis major challenge came against Pakistan for the two Twenty20 matches, where he kept wicket. In the first match, he was out for a second-ball duck off a superb delivery by [[Shoaib Akhtar]]. In the second T20I he scored 11 runs. He then participated in the five-match ODI series where South Africa were chasing 203 to win and he scored 51 before he was caught and bowled by Saeed Ajmal. In the second ODI he scored 29 as he was bowled by [[Shahid Afridi]]; in the same match, a flamboyant [[Abdul Razzaq (cricketer)|Abdul Razzaq]] played the greatest innings of his life to lift Pakistan to an unbelievable victory. During the third match, he scored 19 before he was stumped by [[Zulqarnain Haider]]. It turned out to be a mistake by the umpire as he had pressed the wrong button. In the fourth match, he missed out on a half-century while on 49 when he gave his wicket to the fielder at point. His good form in the series continued when he scored 61 in the final ODI as South Africa won by 57 runs and the series 3\u20132.\n\nFor his performances in 2009 and 2010, he was named in the World Test XI by the ICC,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci-icc/content/story/427665.html|title=Johnson and Gambhir scoop top awards|date=1 October 2009|website=Cricinfo}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci-icc/content/story/480081.html|title=Dhoni leads ICC Test Team of Year|date=6 October 2010|website=Cricinfo}}</ref> and was also named in the World ODI XI in 2010.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci-icc/content/story/480086.html|title=Ponting named to lead ODI team of the year|date=6 October 2010|website=Cricinfo}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n===2011 Cricket World Cup===\nAB de Villiers scored two successive centuries in the [[2011 Cricket World Cup|2011 World Cup]].

February 1984), is a South African cricketer. In limited overs cricket he is an attacking batsman.<ref>{{cite web |title=The men's ODI XI of the last 25 years |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/25/content/story/1146989.html |website=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=22 June 2019 |language=en |date=18 June 2018}}</ref> He was named as the [[ICC ODI Player of the Year]] three times during his 15-year international career. His name was also featured in Wisden Cricketers of the Decade at the end of 2019.\n\nDe Villiers began his international career as a wicket-keeper-batsman, but he has played most often solely as a batsman. He batted at various positions in the batting order, but predominantly in the middle-order. Noted as one of the most innovative and destructive batsmen in the modern era, De Villiers is known for a range of unorthodox shots, particularly behind the wicket-keeper.<ref name=absuperman>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/ab-de-villiers-retires-what-made-mr-360-a-modern-day-great-1239718-2018-05-23 |title=AB de Villiers retires: What made Mr. 360 a modern-day great |last=Sen |first=Rohan |date=23 May 2018 |magazine=[[India Today]] |access-date=9 September 2018}}</ref> \n\nHe made his international debut in a [[Test cricket|Test match]] against England in 2004 and first played a [[One Day International]] (ODI) in early 2005. His debut in [[Twenty20 International]] cricket came in 2006. He scored over 8,000 [[Run (cricket)|runs]] in both Test and ODI cricket and is one of the very few batsmen to have a [[batting average (cricket)|batting average]] of over fifty in both forms of the game.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/23581884/ab-de-villiers-genius-two-formats |title=AB de Villiers: A genius in two formats |last1=Rajesh |first1=S. |last2=Jayaraman |first2=Shiva |date=23 May 2018 |website=[[ESPNcricinfo]] |access-date=24 May 2018}}</ref> He holds the record for the fastest ODI century in just 31 balls.

He holds the record for most Test innings without registering a duck (78),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.howstat.com/cricket/Statistics/Batting/BattingDucks4.asp |title=Players Batting 30 Innings before First Duck |website=Howstat |access-date=27 November 2008}}</ref> before being dismissed for nought against [[Bangladesh national cricket team|Bangladesh]] in November 2008. He also holds the second-highest individual score by a South African batsman, with 278 (not out). Until 2012 he was an occasional [[wicket-keeper]] for South Africa, although after the retirement of regular Test keeper [[Mark Boucher]] and under his own captaincy he has started to regularly keep wicket for the national side in Tests, ODIs and T20Is. He gave up wicket-keeping in 2015 and handed the gloves to [[debutant]] [[Quinton de Kock]].\n\nHe holds the records for the fastest 50 (16 balls), 100 (31 balls) and 150 (64 balls) of all time in One Day Internationals by any batsmen, and also holds the fastest hundred by a South African in Tests and the fastest 50 by South African in T20Is. He is a three-time ICC ODI player of the year, winning the award in 2010, 2014 and 2015.\n\nAfter the [[2011 Cricket World Cup]] he succeeded [[Graeme Smith]] as captain of the national ODI side, and became Test captain after the second Test of the [[English cricket team in South Africa in 2015\u201316|home series against England in 2015/16]]. He stepped down from Test captaincy in December 2016 due to an elbow injury which kept him out of the team for a long period.\n\n==International career==\n[[File:AB de villiers (cropped).jpg|thumb|252px|De Villiers in 2006]]\n\n===Early career===\nAfter a spell in the South Africa U19 team, he made his debut for the Titans in 2003/4.\n\nHe made his Test debut as a 20-year-old on 16 December 2004 against England at Port Elizabeth. He made a strong impression opening the batting, but was dropped down the order for the second Test and also handed the wicket-keeping gloves. In this match, he made a match-saving half-century from number seven. However, he found himself at the top of the order again for the final Test of the series.\n\nDespite a good tour of the Caribbean where he scored 178 to help South Africa seal a Test series win, his rapid progress was slowed on the [[South African cricket team in Australia in 2005-06|tour of Australia]] in 2005. Despite playing [[Shane Warne]] well and becoming the second-youngest and second-fastest South African to reach 1,000 Test runs after [[Graeme Pollock]], he struggled and made just 152 runs in 6 innings.\n\nHe has been used in a similar fashion to [[Jonty Rhodes]] in ODIs, opening the innings, although he currently bats in the middle order. De Villiers gave the selectors a sign by producing his then highest one-day score of 92 not out, which included 12 fours and one six, from 98 balls against India in the 2006 winter series.\n\nDe Villiers had a reputation as an outstanding fielder, typified by a diving run-out of [[Simon Katich]] of Australia in 2006, when he dived to stop the ball, and while still lying on his stomach facing away from the stumps, he tossed the ball backwards over his shoulder and effected a direct hit. This has also led people to make further comparisons of him to Jonty Rhodes, who was also one of the finest fielders of his generation. His fielding positions other than wicket-keeper are 1st and 2nd slip and cover.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH8KrkRYIQA |title=Ponting's Top Five fielders of all time |author=Cricket.com.au |date=21 May 2017 |website=YouTube |accessdate=27 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===2007 Cricket World Cup in West Indies===\nCompeting in the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]], AB was in good form in ODIs having scored four 50s during the South Africa vs India/Pakistan (2007) matches.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn the early stages of the tournament AB's form was poor with three failures including a duck against the [[Netherlands national cricket team|Netherlands]] in a match where his team broke various records for batting,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wc2007/content/story/285626.html?object=247462 |title=Gibbs sets records galore |first1=S. |last1=Rajesh |first2=H.

He had to bat with a runner for the latter stages of his innings and found every shot painful due to a combination of cramps, heat exhaustion and dehydration.{{citation needed |date=May 2016}} His innings consisted of a second wicket partnership of 170 with [[Jacques Kallis]] and a third wicket partnership of 70 with [[Herschelle Gibbs]]. De Villiers' innings helped set up a total of 356/4 from 50 overs.\n\nHis batting during the World Cup was inconsistent as he also [[Duck (cricket)|failed to score]] on 4 occasions, itself a record.<ref name=\"stats.ODI\">{{cite web |url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/44936.html?class=2;template=results;trophy=12;type=batting;view=innings |title=Statistics: AB De Villiers One-Day Internationals |website=ESPNcricinfo |access-date=17 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Gaining attention===\nOn 4 April 2008, De Villiers became the first South African to score a [[double century]] against [[India national cricket team|India]] with his top score of 217.\n\nDe Villiers scored an obdurate 174 that helped set up a ten-wicket win for South Africa in the second Test against England at Headingley Carnegie in Leeds in July 2008. This was followed by a 97 at [[The Oval]] before he came down the wicket trying to smash [[Monty Panesar]] for a boundary and was caught on the fence.\n\nIn the first Test in Perth, De Villiers scored a match-winning century to help South Africa chase down the second-highest-ever fourth innings target of 414 with six wickets in hand. This was South Africa's first Test victory in Australia in 15 years and appeared to go a long way towards tilting world cricket's balance of power after over a decade of Australian dominance. De Villiers also took four diving catches in the course of the match, including one to dismiss [[Jason Krejza]], a stunner at backward point.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://content-nz.cricinfo.com/ausvrsa2008_09/engine/match/351681.html |title=1st Test Australia v South Africa at Perth, 17\u201321 December 2008 |website=ESPNcricinfo |access-date=21 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nDe Villiers only scored 11 runs in the second Test at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] and made another low score in the first innings of the final Test at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]. In the second innings of that Test though, De Villiers scored a patient half-century as South Africa almost held on for an against-the-odds draw.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/ausvrsa2008_09/engine/current/match/351683.html |title=3rd Test, South Africa tour of Australia at Sydney, 3-7 January 2009 |website=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=4 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nDuring ODI series, in the 4th ODI in Adelaide, he played as wicket-keeper after Boucher was ruled out. He then scored 82 not out from 85 balls with 6 fours and a six to win the series and was named the man of the match.\n\nIn the first Test of the return series at the Wanderers Stadium, De Villiers provided lone resistance in the first innings against a bowling attack led by pace bowler, [[Mitchell Johnson (cricketer)|Mitchell Johnson]], scoring 104* off 185 balls with 9 fours and 1 six, while his teammates all fell for under 50. But in the second innings he made only 3 off 7.\n\nIn the third Test, after centuries from [[Ashwell Prince]] and Jacques Kallis, De Villiers was the third centurion of the innings with a score of 163 off 196 balls with 12 fours and 7 sixes. This knock also tied the record for most sixes in an over as De Villiers, off the bowling of McDonald, hit four consecutive sixes.\n\nIn the following 5-game ODI series, De Villiers played consistently, although starting badly in the first game, scoring only 2 runs. However, he went on to make 36*, 80, 84 and 38 and was named Player of the Series at the conclusion of game 5.\n\nHe was rested for the two-match Twenty20 series against Zimbabwe and because [[Mark Boucher]] was injured as well [[Heino Kuhn]] donned the keeping gloves. De Villiers returned for the ODI series and also took over the gloves while Boucher was recovering. He did well against Zimbabwe scoring two centuries out of the three ODIs as South Africa comfortably won the three match series 3\u20130.\n\nHis major challenge came against Pakistan for the two Twenty20 matches, where he kept wicket. In the first match, he was out for a second-ball duck off a superb delivery by [[Shoaib Akhtar]]. In the second T20I he scored 11 runs. He then participated in the five-match ODI series where South Africa were chasing 203 to win and he scored 51 before he was caught and bowled by Saeed Ajmal. In the second ODI he scored 29 as he was bowled by [[Shahid Afridi]]; in the same match, a flamboyant [[Abdul Razzaq (cricketer)|Abdul Razzaq]] played the greatest innings of his life to lift Pakistan to an unbelievable victory.
