He envisioned Sand Springs as a haven for orphans and widows.  He helped found and develop Sand Springs as a model city that included all components of a total community.<ref name=\"EOHC-SS\">[http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=SA017 Carl N. Gregory, \"Sand Springs\", ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402133246/http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=SA017 |date=2015-04-02 }}, Accessed May 6, 2011.</ref>\n\nPage bought 160 acres of land in Tulsa County, Oklahoma in 1908, intending to build a home for orphan children. The first 27 children, who had been abandoned by the Hook & Anchor Orphanage in Tulsa,<!-- what does this mean? they threw the orphans out? --> were housed in a tent. This was soon replaced by a frame building large enough to house 50 children.\n\nPage decided to form a model community, to be called Sand Springs, on land west of the children's home. He offered free land to any person who wished to move there, and a $20,000 bonus (the amount varied and he also offered free utilities) to companies that would relocate there. In 1911, Page created the [[Sand Springs Railway]], an interurban connecting Sand Springs to Tulsa. The townsite was laid out the same year.<ref name = \"EOHC-SS\"/> Sand Springs was incorporated as a city in 1912, with a population of 400.<ref name=\"Davenport\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsaokhistory.com/cities/sandsprings.html|title=History of Sand Springs, OK|website=www.tulsaokhistory.com|accessdate=24 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107112750/http://www.tulsaokhistory.com/cities/sandsprings.html|archivedate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1911 Page also built the Sand Springs Power Plant, on the southeast corner of Main Street and Morrow Road. It anchored an area that Page intended to use for industrial development. Several significant additions were made to the facility, and it was the sole source of electric power for Sand Springs until 1947.<ref>National Register of Historic Places Registration Form. \"Sand Springs Power Plant.\"</ref>\n\nSome of the earliest manufacturing industries were: Kerr Glass Manufacturing; Commander Mills, Kerr, Hubbard and Kelley Lamp, and Chimney; Southwest Box Company; and Sinclair Prairie Refining Company. Medical and social welfare institutions other than the Sand Springs Home included the Oakwood Sanitorium for nervous and mental diseases, Poole Hospital, the Salvation Army Maternity Home, and the Sand Springs School for the Deaf.<ref name = \"Davenport\" /> Sand Springs became a center of glass production in Oklahoma. Kerr Glass Manufacturing moved to Sand Springs from Chicago in 1913. It and the Alexander H.

Over 50 students were sent to nearby hospitals. The school didn't have [[carbon monoxide detectors]] at the time, which the district said \"it'll resolve\".

He envisioned Sand Springs as a haven for orphans and widows.  He helped found and develop Sand Springs as a model city that included all components of a total community.<ref name=\"EOHC-SS\">[http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=SA017 Carl N. Gregory, \"Sand Springs\", ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402133246/http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=SA017 |date=2015-04-02 }}, Accessed May 6, 2011.</ref>\n\nPage bought 160 acres of land in Tulsa County, Oklahoma in 1908, intending to build a home for orphan children. The first 27 children, who had been abandoned by the Hook & Anchor Orphanage in Tulsa,<!-- what does this mean? they threw the orphans out? --> were housed in a tent. This was soon replaced by a frame building large enough to house 50 children.\n\nPage decided to form a model community, to be called Sand Springs, on land west of the children's home. He offered free land to any person who wished to move there, and a $20,000 bonus (the amount varied and he also offered free utilities) to companies that would relocate there. In 1911, Page created the [[Sand Springs Railway]], an interurban connecting Sand Springs to Tulsa. The townsite was laid out the same year.<ref name = \"EOHC-SS\"/> Sand Springs was incorporated as a city in 1912, with a population of 400.<ref name=\"Davenport\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsaokhistory.com/cities/sandsprings.html|title=History of Sand Springs, OK|website=www.tulsaokhistory.com|accessdate=24 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107112750/http://www.tulsaokhistory.com/cities/sandsprings.html|archivedate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1911 Page also built the Sand Springs Power Plant, on the southeast corner of Main Street and Morrow Road. It anchored an area that Page intended to use for industrial development. Several significant additions were made to the facility, and it was the sole source of electric power for Sand Springs until 1947.<ref>National Register of Historic Places Registration Form. \"Sand Springs Power Plant.\"</ref>\n\nSome of the earliest manufacturing industries were: Kerr Glass Manufacturing; Commander Mills, Kerr, Hubbard and Kelley Lamp, and Chimney; Southwest Box Company; and Sinclair Prairie Refining Company. Medical and social welfare institutions other than the Sand Springs Home included the Oakwood Sanitorium for nervous and mental diseases, Poole Hospital, the Salvation Army Maternity Home, and the Sand Springs School for the Deaf.<ref name = \"Davenport\" /> Sand Springs became a center of glass production in Oklahoma. Kerr Glass Manufacturing moved to Sand Springs from Chicago in 1913. It and the Alexander H.

Any knowledge you accept is veda, for the teachings of the Vedas are the original knowledge. In the conditioned state, our knowledge is subjected to many deficiencies. The difference between a conditioned soul and a liberated soul is that the conditioned soul has four kinds of defects. The first defect is that he must commit mistakes. ... To err is human. This is one defect of the conditioned soul. Another defect: to be illusioned. Illusion means to accept something which is not: m\u0101y\u0101. M\u0101y\u0101 means \u201cwhat is not.\u201d Everyone is accepting the body as the self. ... But you are not this body. This is illusion. The third defect is the cheating propensity. Everyone has the propensity to cheat others. Although a person is fool number one, he poses himself as very intelligent. Although it is already pointed out that he is in illusion and makes mistakes, he will theorize: \u201cI think this is this, this is this.\u201d But he does not even know his own position. He writes books of philosophy, although he is defective. That is his disease. That is cheating. Lastly, our senses are imperfect. We are very proud of our eyes. Often, someone will challenge, \u201cCan you show me God?\u201d But do you have the eyes to see God? You will never see if you haven\u2019t the eyes. If immediately the room becomes dark, you cannot even see your hands. So what power do you have to see? We cannot, therefore, expect knowledge (veda) with these imperfect senses. With all these deficiencies, in conditioned life we cannot give perfect knowledge to anyone. Nor are we ourselves perfect. Therefore we accept the Vedas as they are.}}</ref> one can compare each yuga's characteristics (human lifespan, dharma, etc.) to the present and historic state of the world and [[empirical evidence|empirically]] deduce which is the current yuga.\n\nFor example, the average human [[life expectancy]] worldwide since the 1700s has been below 80 years.

Humans were long lived, powerfully built, honest, youthful, vigorous, erudite and virtuous. The Vedas were one. All mankind could attain to supreme blessedness. There was no agriculture or mining as the earth yielded those riches on its own. Weather was pleasant and everyone was happy. There were no religious sects. There was no disease, decrepitude or fear of anything.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Virtue reigns supreme. Human stature was 21 cubits (33 ft 6 inches).

Any knowledge you accept is veda, for the teachings of the Vedas are the original knowledge. In the conditioned state, our knowledge is subjected to many deficiencies. The difference between a conditioned soul and a liberated soul is that the conditioned soul has four kinds of defects. The first defect is that he must commit mistakes. ... To err is human. This is one defect of the conditioned soul. Another defect: to be illusioned. Illusion means to accept something which is not: m\u0101y\u0101. M\u0101y\u0101 means \u201cwhat is not.\u201d Everyone is accepting the body as the self. ... But you are not this body. This is illusion. The third defect is the cheating propensity. Everyone has the propensity to cheat others. Although a person is fool number one, he poses himself as very intelligent. Although it is already pointed out that he is in illusion and makes mistakes, he will theorize: \u201cI think this is this, this is this.\u201d But he does not even know his own position. He writes books of philosophy, although he is defective. That is his disease. That is cheating. Lastly, our senses are imperfect. We are very proud of our eyes. Often, someone will challenge, \u201cCan you show me God?\u201d But do you have the eyes to see God? You will never see if you haven\u2019t the eyes. If immediately the room becomes dark, you cannot even see your hands. So what power do you have to see? We cannot, therefore, expect knowledge (veda) with these imperfect senses. With all these deficiencies, in conditioned life we cannot give perfect knowledge to anyone. Nor are we ourselves perfect.

Nevertheless, sentence extraction summaries can give valuable clues to the main points of a document and are frequently sufficiently intelligible to human readers.\n\n== Procedure ==\nUsually, a combination of heuristics is used to determine the most important sentences within the document. Each heuristic assigns a (positive or negative) score to the sentence. After all heuristics have been applied, the highest-scoring sentences are included in the summary.\nThe individual heuristics are weighted according to their importance.\n\n=== Early approaches and some sample heuristics ===\nSeminal papers which laid the foundations for many techniques used today have been published by [[Hans Peter Luhn]] in 1958<ref>{{Cite journal\n | author = [[Hans Peter Luhn]]\n | title = The Automatic Creation of Literature Abstracts\n | journal = [[IBM Journal]]\n |date=April 1958\n | pages = 159&ndash;165\n | url = http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/022/luhn.pdf\n}}</ref> and [[H.

He also distinguished between ''bonus words'' and ''stigma words'', i.e. words that probably occur together with important (e.g. the word form \"significant\") or unimportant information.\nHis idea of using key-words, i.e. words which occur significantly frequently in the document, is still one of the core heuristics of today's summarizers. With large linguistic corpora available today, the [[tf\u2013idf]] value which originated in [[information retrieval]], can be successfully applied to identify the key words of a text: If for example the word \"cat\" occurs significantly more often in the text to be summarized (TF = \"term frequency\") than in the corpus (IDF means \"inverse document frequency\"; here the corpus is meant by \"document\"), then \"cat\" is likely to be an important word of the text; the text may in fact be a text about cats.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Text segmentation]]\n* [[Sentence boundary disambiguation]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Natural Language Processing}}\n\n[[Category:Computational linguistics]]\n[[Category:Natural language processing]]\n", "name_user": "Monist H", "label": "safe", "comment": "Real Life Applications", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_extraction"}

Specifically, [[Richard Foster Flint]] had argued that the North American ice sheet originated in the [[Torngat Mountains|Torngat mountains]], accumulating in the coastal zone and then spreading westward down the inland slopes of the Torngats; this scenario would have been a mirror image of the well-documented model of glaciation in northern Europe. Based on geomorphological evidence, as well as on his perception that the so-called Torngat Mountain Range is actually an escarpment on the edge of a tilted peneplain with almost no western slopes, Ives refuted the previous model, proposing instead that inception  of glaciation occurred across wide areas of the plateau as climate change permitted year-round  snow cover to accumulate, a process he refers to as ''instantaneous glacierization.''<ref name=torngat>{{cite journal |last=Ives |first=J.  |year=1957 |title=Glaciation of the Torngat Mountains, Northern Labrador|journal=Arctic |volume=10|issue=2 |pages=67-87 |url=http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic10-2-66.pdf |access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=naturwissenschaften>{{cite journal |author1-last=Ives |author1-first=Jack  |author2-last=Andrews | author2-first=John | author3-last=Barry |author3-first=Roger | year=1975 |title=Growth and Decay of the Laurentide Ice Sheet and Comparisons with Fenno-Scandinavia |journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=62|issue=2 |pages=118-125 }}</ref>\n  \nOn completion of his doctorate, Ives was appointed Assistant Professor in McGill's Department of Geography, and, from 1957 to 1960, he served as  Field Director of McGill Subarctic Research Station, where he initiated  field research programs on permafrost and on the glaciation and deglaciation of Labrador-Ungava.<ref name=fs-barry />   \n\nFrom 1960 to 1967 Ives was assistant director and then director of the Geographical Branch of Canada's [[Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources|Department of Energy, Mines and Resources]] in Ottawa.<ref name=\"fs-barry\" />    In that capacity he coordinated  seven interdisciplinary expeditions to [[Baffin Island]].<ref name=fs-barry /><ref name=\"baffin\">{{ cite book | last=Ives | first=Jack | year =2017 |title= Baffin Island: Field Research and High Arctic Adventure, 1961-1967 }}</ref>\n\n===Boulder, Colorado===\nFrom 1967 to 1979  Ives served as director of the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research, University of Colorado, Boulder, and professor of  geography from 1967 to 1989.<ref name=\"pirineos\" /><ref name=fs-barry /> In 1968 [[Carl Troll]] founded the Commission on High Altitude Geoecology under the auspices of the [[International Geographical Union]], and invited Ives to join the organizing committee.

Specifically, [[Richard Foster Flint]] had argued that the North American ice sheet originated in the [[Torngat Mountains|Torngat mountains]], accumulating in the coastal zone and then spreading westward down the inland slopes of the Torngats; this scenario would have been a mirror image of the well-documented model of glaciation in northern Europe. Based on geomorphological evidence, as well as on his perception that the so-called Torngat Mountain Range is actually an escarpment on the edge of a tilted peneplain with almost no western slopes, Ives refuted the previous model, proposing instead that inception  of glaciation occurred across wide areas of the plateau as climate change permitted year-round  snow cover to accumulate, a process he refers to as ''instantaneous glacierization.''<ref name=torngat>{{cite journal |last=Ives |first=J.  |year=1957 |title=Glaciation of the Torngat Mountains, Northern Labrador|journal=Arctic |volume=10|issue=2 |pages=67-87 |url=http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic10-2-66.pdf |access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=naturwissenschaften>{{cite journal |author1-last=Ives |author1-first=Jack  |author2-last=Andrews | author2-first=John | author3-last=Barry |author3-first=Roger | year=1975 |title=Growth and Decay of the Laurentide Ice Sheet and Comparisons with Fenno-Scandinavia |journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=62|issue=2 |pages=118-125 }}</ref>\n  \nOn completion of his doctorate, Ives was appointed Assistant Professor in McGill's Department of Geography, and, from 1957 to 1960, he served as  Field Director of McGill Subarctic Research Station, where he initiated  field research programs on permafrost and on the glaciation and deglaciation of Labrador-Ungava.<ref name=fs-barry />   \n\nFrom 1960 to 1967 Ives was assistant director and then director of the Geographical Branch of Canada's [[Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources|Department of Energy, Mines and Resources]] in Ottawa.<ref name=\"fs-barry\" />    In that capacity he coordinated  seven interdisciplinary expeditions to [[Baffin Island]].<ref name=fs-barry /><ref name=\"baffin\">{{ cite book | last=Ives | first=Jack | year =2017 |title= Baffin Island: Field Research and High Arctic Adventure, 1961-1967 }}</ref>\n\n===Boulder, Colorado===\nFrom 1967 to 1979  Ives served as director of the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research, University of Colorado, Boulder, and professor of  geography from 1967 to 1989.<ref name=\"pirineos\" /><ref name=fs-barry /> In 1968 [[Carl Troll]] founded the Commission on High Altitude Geoecology under the auspices of the [[International Geographical Union]], and invited Ives to join the organizing committee.

[[Slavery in the colonial United States|Slavery]] was ingrained in the economic and social fabric of [[Colony of Virginia|colonial Virginia]], and [[George Washington|Washington]] inherited his first ten slaves at the age of eleven on the death of his father in 1743. In adulthood his personal slaveholding grew through inheritance, purchase and natural increase. In 1759, he gained control of [[Dowry|dower]] slaves belonging to the Custis estate on his marriage to [[Martha Dandridge Custis]]. Washington's early attitudes to slavery reflected the prevailing Virginia [[Planter class|planter]] views of the day, and so he demonstrated no moral qualms about the institution. He became skeptical about the economic efficacy of slavery before the [[American Revolutionary War]], and expressed support in private for abolition by a gradual legislative process after the war. Washington remained dependent on slave labor, and by the time of his death in 1799 there were 317 slaves at his [[Mount Vernon]] estate, 124 owned by Washington and the remainder managed by him as his own property but belonging to other people.\n\nWashington was a demanding master. He provided his slaves with basic food, clothing and accommodation comparable to general practice at the time but not always adequate, and with medical care. In return, he expected them to work diligently from sunrise to sunset over the six-day working week that was standard at the time. Some three-quarters of the slaves labored in the fields, while the remainder worked at the main residence as domestic servants and artisans. They supplemented their diet by hunting, trapping, and growing vegetables in their free time, and bought extra rations, clothing and housewares with income from the sale of game and produce. They built their own community around marriage and family, though because Washington allocated slaves to farms according to the demands of the business without regard for their relationships, many husbands lived separately from their wives and children. Washington used both reward and punishment to encourage and discipline his slaves, but was constantly disappointed when they failed to meet his exacting standards. They resisted enslavement by various means, including theft to supplement food and clothing and as another source of income, by feigning illness, and by running away.\n\nWashington's first doubts about slavery were entirely economic, prompted by his transition from tobacco to grain crops in the 1760s which left him with a costly surplus of slaves. As commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in 1775, he initially refused to accept African-Americans, free or slave, into the ranks, but reversed this position due to the demands of war. The first indication of moral doubt appeared during efforts to sell some of his slaves in 1778, when Washington expressed distaste for selling them at a public venue and his desire that slave families not be split up as a result of the sale. His public words and deeds at the end of the American Revolutionary War in 1783 betrayed no antislavery sentiments. Politically, Washington was concerned that such a divisive issue as [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] should not threaten national unity, and he never spoke publicly about the institution. Privately, Washington considered freeing all the slaves he controlled in the mid-1790s, but could not realize this because of his failure to secure his own financial security and the refusal of his family to cooperate. His will provided for the emancipation of his own slaves, and he was the only [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father]] to do this. Because many of his slaves were married to Martha's dower slaves, whom he could not legally free, Washington stipulated that, with the exception of his valet William Lee who was freed immediately, his slaves be emancipated on the death of Martha. She freed them in 1801, a year before her own death, but her dower slaves were passed to her grandchildren and remained in bondage.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|History of slavery in Virginia}}\n[[File:The Leading Facts of American History (1910) - The First Negro Slaves Brought to Virginia.png|thumb|First slaves arriving in Virginia|alt=Black and white illustration]]\nSlavery was introduced into the English [[colony of Virginia]] when the first Africans were transported to [[Old Point Comfort|Point Comfort]] in 1619. Those who accepted Christianity became \"Christian servants\" with time-limited servitude, or even freed, but this mechanism for ending bondage was gradually shut down. In 1667, the [[Virginia General Assembly|Virginia Assembly]] passed a law that barred [[baptism]] as a means of conferring freedom. Africans who had been baptised before arriving in Virginia could be granted the status of [[Indentured servitude|indentured servant]] until 1682, when another law declared them to be slaves. Whites and people of African descent in the lowest stratum of Virginian society shared common disadvantages and a common lifestyle, which included intermarriage until the Assembly made such unions punishable by banishment in 1691.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 41\u201343</ref>\n\nIn 1671, Virginia counted 6,000 white indentured servants among its 40,000 population but only 2,000 people of African descent, up to a third of whom in some counties were free. Towards the end of the 17th century, British policy shifted in favor of retaining cheap labor rather than shipping it to the colonies, and the supply of indentured servants in Virginia began to dry up; by 1715, annual immigration was in the hundreds, compared with 1,500\u20132,000 in the 1680s. As tobacco planters put more land under cultivation, they made up the shortfall in labor with increasing numbers of slaves. The institution was rooted in race with the [[Virginia Slave Codes of 1705]], and from around 1710 the growth in the slave population was fueled by natural increase. Between 1700 and 1750 the number of slaves in the colony increased from 13,000 to 105,000, nearly eighty percent of them born in Virginia.<ref>Wiencek 2003 43\u201346</ref> In Washington's lifetime, slavery was deeply ingrained in the economic and social fabric of Virginia, where some forty percent of the population and virtually all African Americans were enslaved.<ref>Henriques 2008 p. 146</ref>\n\nGeorge Washington was born February 22, 1732, the first child of his father [[Augustine Washington|Augustine]]'s second marriage. Augustine was a tobacco planter with some {{convert|10,000|acre|ha}} of land and 50 slaves. On his death in 1743, he left his {{convert|2,500|acre|ha|adj=on}} Little Hunting Creek to George's older half-brother [[Lawrence Washington (1718\u20131752)|Lawrence]], who renamed it [[Mount Vernon]].

Horses and mules were bred in stables there, and tropical plants were grown in a greenhouse. Trades such as blacksmithing, carpentry, barrel making (coopering), food production and preservation, spinning, weaving and shoe making were carried out in other buildings at Mansion House Farm. Some crops were grown at this farm, but the main agricultural business was conducted at the four outlying farms located in a radius of between {{convert|1+1/2|mi|km|spell=in}} and {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} from the mansion: Dogue Run Farm, Muddy Hole Farm, Union Farm (formed from the earlier Ferry Farm and French's Farm) and River Farm.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 4</ref> A farm manager responsible for the running of the estate reported directly to Washington, while an overseer was employed at each of the farms.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 78\u201379</ref>}}\n\n[[File:A Map of Washington's Farms at Mt.

They were kept busy year round, their tasks varying with the season.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 117\u2013118</ref> The remainder worked as domestic servants in the main residence or as artisans, such as carpenters, [[joiner]]s, [[Cooper (profession)|coopers]], [[Hand spinning|spinners]] and seamstresses.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 109\u2013111</ref> Between 1766 and 1799, seven dower slaves worked at one time or another as overseers.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 86, 343\u2013344</ref> Slaves were expected to work from sunrise to sunset over a six-day work week that was standard on Virginia plantations. With two hours off for meals, their workdays would range between seven and a half hours to thirteen hours, depending on season. They were given three or four days off at Christmas and a day each at Easter and [[Whitsunday]].<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 106\u2013107, 122\u2013123</ref> Domestic slaves started early, worked into the evenings and did not necessarily have Sundays and holidays free.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 110, 124, 134</ref> On special occasions when slaves were required to put in extra effort, such as working through a holiday or bringing in the harvest, they were paid or compensated with extra time off.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 123\u2013124</ref>\n\nThere were elements of patriarchy and paternalism in Washington's attitudes to his workforce; he thought of his workers as part of an extended family in which he occupied the position of a father figure, with mutual obligations between master and servant.<ref>Morgan 2000 p. 282</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 45\u201348</ref> He instructed his overseers to treat slaves \"with humanity and tenderness\" when sick.<ref name=Morgan2005-410 /> Slaves who were less able, through injury, disability or age, were given light duties, while those too sick to work were generally, though not always, excused work while they recovered.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 120, 125</ref> Washington provided them with good, sometimes costly medical care{{snd}}when a slave named Cupid fell ill with [[pleurisy]], Washington had him taken to the main house where he could be better cared for and personally checked on him throughout the day.<ref name=Twohig117 /><ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 100</ref> The humanitarian concern for the welfare of his slaves was mixed with an economic consideration for the lost productivity arising from sickness and death among the labor force.<ref name=\"Twohig 2001 p. 116\">Twohig 2001 p. 116</ref><ref>Ellis 2004 p. 46</ref> Although Washington insisted on an emotional distance between master and slave, there are examples of genuine affection, such as was the case with his valet [[William Lee (valet)|William Lee]], and evidence that slaves were able to approach him with their concerns and grievances.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 51\u201353, 97</ref>\n\n===Living conditions===\n[[File:Slave cabin at pioneer farm - Mount Vernon.jpg|thumb|left|Modern reconstruction of a slave cabin at Mount Vernon|alt=Photograph]]\nAt Mansion House Farm, most slaves were housed in a two-story [[Framing (construction)|frame building]] known as the \"Quarters for Families\". This was replaced in 1792 by brick-built accommodation wings either side of the greenhouse comprising four rooms in total, each of some {{convert|600|sqft|m2}}. The [[Mount Vernon Ladies' Association]] have concluded these rooms were communal areas furnished with bunks that allowed little privacy for the predominantly male occupants. Other slaves at Mansion House Farm lived over the outbuildings where they worked or in log cabins.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 162\u2013164, 166\u2013167</ref> Such cabins were the standard slave accommodation at the outlying farms, comparable to the accommodation occupied by the lower strata of free white society across the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake area]] and by slaves on other Virginia plantations.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 162, 167, 169</ref> They provided a single room that ranged in size from 168 square feet (15.6 m2) to 246 square feet (22.9 m2) to house a family.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 168\u2013169</ref> The cabins were often poorly constructed, daubed with mud for draft- and water-proofing, with dirt floors. Some cabins were built as duplexes; some single-unit cabins were small enough to be moved on carts.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 168, 170</ref> There are few sources which shed light on living conditions in these cabins, but one visitor in 1798 wrote, \"husband and wife sleep on a mean pallet, the children on the ground; a very bad fireplace, some utensils for cooking, but in the middle of this poverty some cups and a teapot.\" Other sources suggest the interiors were smoky, dirty and dark, with only a shuttered opening for a window and the fireplace for illumination at night.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 170\u2013172</ref>\n\nWashington provided slaves with a blanket each fall at most, which they used for their own bedding and which they were required to use to gather leaves for livestock bedding.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 175\u2013176</ref> Slaves at the outlying farms were issued with a basic set of clothing each year, comparable to the clothing issued on other Virginia plantations. Slaves slept and worked in their clothes, leaving them to spend many months in garments that were worn, ripped and tattered.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 177\u2013178</ref> Domestic slaves at the main residence who came into regular contact with visitors were better clothed; butlers, waiters and body servants were dressed in a [[livery]] based on the three-piece suit of an 18th-century gentleman, and maids were provided with finer quality clothing than their counterparts in the fields.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 179\u2013181</ref>\n\nWashington desired his slaves to be fed adequately but no more.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 244\u2013245</ref> Each slave was provided with a basic daily food ration of {{convert|1|USqt|l|spell=in}} or more of [[cornmeal]], up to {{convert|8|oz|g|spell=in}} of herring and occasionally some meat, a fairly typical ration for slaves in Virginia that was adequate in terms of the calorie requirement for a young man engaged in moderately heavy agricultural labor but nutritionally deficient.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 221\u2013222, 245</ref> The basic ration was supplemented by slaves' own efforts hunting (for which some slaves were allowed guns) and trapping game. They grew their own vegetables in small garden plots they were permitted to maintain in their own time, on which they also reared poultry.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 229\u2013231</ref>\n\nWashington often tipped slaves on his visits to other estates, and it is likely that his own slaves were similarly rewarded by visitors to Mount Vernon. Slaves occasionally earned money through their normal work or for particular services rendered{{snd}}for example, Washington rewarded three of his own slaves with cash for good service in 1775, a slave received a fee for the care of a mare that was being bred in 1798 and the chef [[Hercules (chef)|Hercules]] profited well by selling slops from the presidential kitchen.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 193\u2013194</ref> Slaves also earned money from their own endeavors, by selling to Washington or at the market in [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] food they had caught or grown and small items they had made.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 197, 231</ref> They used the proceeds to purchase from Washington or the shops in Alexandria better clothing, housewares and extra provisions such as flour, pork, whiskey, tea, coffee and sugar.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 194, 195\u2013196, 232</ref>\n\n===Family and community===\n[[File:Slave Cabin interior 01 - Mount Vernon.jpg|thumb|Interior of the reconstructed slave cabin at Mount Vernon|alt=Photograph showing single bedding on a pallet on a dirt floor]]\nAlthough the law did not recognize slave marriages, Washington did, and by 1799 some two-thirds of the adult slaves at Mount Vernon were married.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 128</ref> To minimize time lost in getting to the workplace and thus increase productivity, slaves were accommodated at the farm on which they worked. Because of the unequal distribution of males and females across the five farms, slaves often found partners on different farms, and in their day to day lives husbands were routinely separated from their wives and children. Only thirty-six of the ninety-six married slaves at Mount Vernon in 1799 lived together, while thirty-eight had spouses who lived on separate farms and twenty-two had spouses who lived on other plantations.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 122</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 132\u2013133</ref> The evidence suggests couples that were separated did not regularly visit during the week, and doing so prompted complaints from Washington that slaves were too exhausted to work after such \"night walking\", leaving Saturday nights/Sundays and holidays as the main time such families could spend together.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 134, 136, 202</ref> Despite the stress and anxiety caused by this indifference to family stability{{snd}}on one occasion an overseer wrote that the separation of families \"seems like death to them\"{{snd}}marriage was the foundation on which slaves established their own community, and longevity in these unions was not uncommon.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 127, 130\u2013131, 132</ref><ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 123</ref>\n\nLarge families that covered multiple generations, along with their attendant marriages, were part of a slave community-building process that transcended ownership. Washington's head carpenter Isaac, for example, lived with his wife Kitty, a dower-slave milkmaid, at Mansion House Farm. The couple had nine daughters ranging in age from six to twenty-seven in 1799, and the marriages of four of those daughters had extended the family to other farms within and outside the Mount Vernon estate and produced three grandchildren.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 135\">Thompson 2019 p. 135</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 p. 421</ref> Children were born into slavery, their ownership determined by the ownership of their mothers.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 309\">Thompson 2019 p. 309</ref> The value attached to the birth of a slave child, if it was noted at all, is indicated in the weekly report of one overseer, which stated, \"Increase 9 Lambs & 1 male child of Lynnas.\" New mothers received a new blanket and three to five weeks of light duties to recover. An infant remained with its mother at her place of work.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 151\u2013152</ref> Older children, the majority of whom lived in single-parent households in which the mother worked from dawn to dusk, performed small family chores but were otherwise left to play largely unsupervised until they reached an age when they could begin to be put to work for Washington, usually somewhere between eleven and fourteen years old.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 158\u2013160</ref> In 1799, nearly sixty percent of the slave population was under nineteen years old and nearly thirty-five percent under nine.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 135\"/>\n\nThere is evidence that slaves passed on their African cultural values through telling stories, among them the tales of [[Br'er Rabbit]] which, with their origins in Africa and stories of a powerless individual triumphing through wit and intelligence over powerful authority, would have resonated with the slaves.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 203</ref> African-born slaves brought with them some of the religious rituals of their ancestral home, and there is an undocumented tradition of voodoo being practiced at one of the Mount Vernon farms.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 211\u2013213</ref> Although the slave condition made it impossible to adhere to the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], some slave names betray a Muslim cultural origin.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 213\u2013214</ref> [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] reached out to American-born slaves in Virginia, and some of the Mount Vernon slaves are known to have been christened before Washington acquired the estate. There is evidence in the historical record from 1797 that Mount Vernon slaves had contacts with [[Baptists]], [[Methodism|Methodists]] and [[Quakers]].<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 208\u2013209</ref> The three religions advocated abolition, raising hopes of freedom among the slaves, and the congregation of the Alexandria Baptist Church, founded in 1803, included slaves formerly owned by Washington.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 209, 210\u2013211</ref>\n\n===Mulattoes===\nIn 1799 there were some twenty [[mulatto]] (mixed race) slaves at Mount Vernon. The probability of paternal relationships between slaves and hired white workers is indicated by some surnames: Betty and Tom Davis, probably the children of Thomas Davis, a white weaver at Mount Vernon in the 1760s; George Young, likely the son of a man of the same name who was a clerk at Mount Vernon in 1774; and [[Oney Judge]] and her sister Delphy, the daughters of Andrew Judge, an indentured tailor at Mount Vernon in the 1770s and 1780s.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 136, 138\u2013139</ref> There is evidence to suggest that white overseers{{snd}}working in close proximity to slaves under the same demanding master and physically and socially isolated from their own peer group, a situation that drove some to drink{{snd}}indulged in sexual relations with the slaves they supervised.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 140\u2013141</ref> Some white visitors to Mount Vernon seemed to have expected slave women to provide sexual favors.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 141\u2013142</ref> The living arrangements left some slave females alone and vulnerable, and the Mount Vernon research historian Mary V. Thompson writes that relationships \"could have been the result of mutual attraction and affection, very real demonstrations of power and control, or even exercises in the manipulation of an authority figure.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 136, 140</ref>{{efn|There is an oral tradition among the descendants of the freedman [[West Ford (slave)|West Ford]] that he was the son of Washington and Venus, a slave belonging to Washington's brother [[John Augustine Washington]]. A case made by the historian Henry Wiencek is, according to the historian Philip Morgan, \"so circumstantial as to be fanciful,\" and there is no evidence that Washington ever met Venus, let alone fathered a child by her.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 147\u2013151</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 419, 420 n26</ref>}}\n\n===Resistance===\n[[File:Oney Judge Runaway Ad.jpg|thumb|left|Advertisement placed in the ''Pennsylvania Gazette'' after Oney Judge absconded from the President's House in 1796|alt=Newspaper clipping]]\nThe frequent comments Washington made about \"rogueries\" and \"old tricks\" indicate the resistance displayed by the slaves against the system.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 261</ref> The most common act of resistance was theft, so common that Washington made allowances for it as part of normal wastage. Food was stolen both to supplement rations and to sell, and Washington believed the selling of tools was another source of income for slaves. Because cloth and clothing were commonly stolen, Washington required seamstresses to show the results of their work and the leftover scraps before issuing them with more material. Sheep were washed before shearing to prevent the theft of wool, and storage areas were kept locked and keys left with trusted individuals.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 269\u2013271</ref> In 1792, Washington ordered the culling of slaves' dogs he believed were being used in a spate of livestock theft and ruled that slaves who kept dogs without authorization were to be \"severely punished\" and their dogs hanged.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 201</ref>\n\nAnother means by which slaves resisted, one that was virtually impossible to prove, was feigning illness. Over the years Washington became increasingly skeptical about absenteeism due to sickness among his slaves and concerned about the diligence or ability of his overseers in recognizing genuine cases. Between 1792 and 1794, while Washington was away from Mount Vernon as President, the number of days lost to sickness increased tenfold compared to 1786, when he was resident at Mount Vernon and able to control the situation personally. In one case, Washington suspected a slave of frequently avoiding work over a period of decades through acts of deliberate self harm.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 261\u2013263, 264\u2013265</ref>\n\nSlaves asserted some independence and frustrated Washington by the pace and quality of their work.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 105, 265</ref> In 1760, Washington noted that four of his carpenters quadrupled their output of timber under his personal supervision.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 93\u201394</ref> Thirty-five years later, he described his carpenters as an \"idle...set of rascals\" who would take a month or more to complete at Mount Vernon work that was being done in two or three days in [[Philadelphia]]. The output of seamstresses dropped off when Martha was away, and spinners found they could slacken by playing the overseers off against her.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 266\u2013267</ref> Tools were regularly lost or damaged, thus stopping work, and Washington despaired of employing innovations that might improve efficiency because he believed the slaves were too clumsy to operate the new machinery involved.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 266, 268</ref>\n\nThe most emphatic act of resistance was to run away, and between 1760 and 1799 at least forty-seven slaves under Washington's control did so.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 275</ref> Seventeen of these, fourteen men and three women, escaped to a British warship that anchored in the [[Potomac River]] near Mount Vernon in 1781.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 278, 279</ref> In general, the best chance of success lay with second- or third-generation African-American slaves who had good English, possessed skills that would allow them to support themselves as free people and were in close enough contact with their masters to receive special privileges. Thus it was that Judge, an especially talented seamstress, and Hercules escaped in 1796 and 1797 respectively and eluded recapture.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 281, 284\u2013286</ref> Washington took seriously the recapture of fugitives, and in three cases an escaped slave was sold off in the West Indies after recapture, effectively a death sentence in the severe conditions slaves had to endure there.<ref name=\"Wiencek 2003 p. 132\">Wiencek 2003 p. 132</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 411\u2013412</ref><ref>Chernow 2010 p. 161</ref>\n\n===Control===\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|salign=right\n|width=25%\n|quote=Slavery was a system in which enslaved people lived in fear; fear of being sold, fear of being separated from their families or their children or their parents, fear of not being in control of their bodies or their lives, fear of never knowing freedom.

By 1766, he had transitioned his business from the labor-intensive planting of tobacco to the less demanding farming of grain crops. His slaves were employed on a greater variety of tasks that needed more skills than tobacco planting required of them; as well as the cultivation of grains and vegetables, they were employed in cattle herding, spinning, weaving and carpentry. The transition left Washington with a surplus of slaves and revealed to him the inefficiencies of the slave labor system.<ref name=Morgan2005p413>Morgan 2005 p. 413</ref><ref name=Twohig118>Twohig 2001 p. 118</ref>\n\nThere is little evidence that Washington seriously questioned the ethics of slavery before the Revolution.<ref name=Twohig118 /> In the 1760s he often participated in tavern lotteries, events in which defaulters' debts were settled by raffling off their assets to a high-spirited crowd.<ref>Chernow 2010 p. 162</ref> In 1769, Washington co-managed one such lottery in which fifty-five slaves were sold, among them six families and five females with children. The more valuable married males were raffled together with their wives and children; less valuable slaves were separated from their families into different lots.

The volumes covered subjects that generally were of importance to him, such as agriculture, the Revolution, the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] and politics. The single pre-1788 pamphlet of the six in ''Tracts on Slavery'' was ''A Serious Address to the Rulers of America, on the Inconsistency of Their Conduct Respecting Slavery'', published in 1783. It was the first pamphlet in the volume, and Washington had written his signature on the cover, as he did with the first pamphlet in each of the thirty-six volumes. Of the eleven pamphlets on slavery that were, presumably, not considered to be worth binding, eight were published before 1788. One of them, published in 1785, was never read. The implication is that Washington became more interested in the subject in the early 1790s.<ref>Furstenberg 2011 pp. 251\u2013253, 260, 263\u2013264</ref>}} All six shared common themes that slaves first had to be educated about the obligations of liberty before they could be emancipated, a belief Washington is reported to have expressed himself in 1798, and that abolition should be realized by a gradual legislative process, an idea that began to appear in Washington's correspondence during the [[Confederation Period|Confederation period]].<ref>Furstenberg 2011 pp. 250\u2013253, 273\u2013275, 285</ref><ref name=\"Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 72\u201373\">Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 72\u201373</ref>\n\nWashington was not impressed by what Dorothy Twohig{{snd}}a former editor-in-chief of [[The Washington Papers]]{{snd}}described as the \"imperious demands\" and \"evangelical piety\" of Quaker efforts to advance abolition, and in 1786 he complained about their \"tamper[ing] with & seduc[ing]\" slaves who \"are happy & content to remain with their present masters.\"<ref>Twohig 2001 p. 129</ref><ref name=Morgan2005p419>Morgan 2005 p. 419</ref> Only the most radical of abolitionists called for immediate emancipation.

On returning to France, Lafayette purchased a plantation in the French colony of Cayenne, modern-day [[French Guiana]], and advised Washington of his progress by letter in 1786. Lafayette had taken concerns about the abrupt emancipation of slaves into account, paying and educating the slaves he settled on the plantation before freeing them. He became a leading figure in the French movement against the slave trade and a corresponding member of the British movement. Washington would not have known of Lafayette's antislavery activities in Cayenne or Europe from Lafayette himself; although the two continued to correspond for the rest of Washington's life, the subject of slavery virtually disappeared from their letters.

He presided over the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in 1787, during which it became obvious just how explosive the issue was and how willing the antislavery faction was to accept the preservation of slavery to ensure national unity and the establishment of a strong federal government. The support of the southern states for the new constitution was secured by granting them concessions that protected slavery, including the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]] and the [[Fugitive Slave Clause]], plus clauses that guaranteed the transatlantic slave trade for at least twenty years and federal aid for the suppression of any slave rebellion.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 422</ref><ref>Twohig 2001 pp. 124\u2013125</ref>\n\nWashington's preeminent position ensured that any actions he took with regard to his own slaves would become a statement in a national debate about slavery that threatened to divide the country. Wiencek suggests Washington considered making precisely such a statement on taking up the presidency in 1789. A passage in the notebook of Washington's biographer [[David Humphreys (soldier)|David Humphreys]]{{efn|Humphreys was a former aide to Washington and had begun an eighteen-month stay at Mount Vernon in 1787 to assist Washington with his correspondence and write his biography.<ref>Ellis 2004 p. 153</ref>}} dated to late 1788 or early 1789 recorded a statement that resembled the emancipation clause in Washington's will a decade later. Wiencek argues the passage was a draft for a public announcement Washington was considering in which he would declare the emancipation of some of his slaves. It marks, Wiencek believes, a moral epiphany in Washington's thinking, the moment he decided not only to emancipate his slaves but also to use the occasion to set the example Lafayette had urged in 1783.<ref name=\"Wiencek272\u2013275\">Wiencek 2003 pp. 272\u2013275</ref> Other historians dispute Wiencek's conclusion; Henriques and [[Joseph Ellis]] concur with Philip Morgan's opinion that Washington experienced no epiphanies in a \"long and hard-headed struggle\" in which there was no single turning point. Morgan argues that Humphreys' passage is the \"private expression of remorse\" from a man unable to extricate himself from the \"tangled web\" of \"mutual dependency\" on slavery, and that Washington believed public comment on such a divisive subject was best avoided for the sake of national unity.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 421\u2013423, 425</ref><ref>Ellis 2004 p. 311 n22</ref><ref name=Henriques159 />{{efn|Wiencek bases his argument on the fact that the passage was written in the past tense and appears in Humphreys' notebook amid drafts Humphreys had written for public statements Washington was to make about assuming the presidency.<ref name=\"Wiencek272\u2013275\" /> Philip Morgan points out that the passage was Humphreys' words in Washington's voice and appears just after a summary Humphreys had written of [[Thomas Clarkson]]'s 1788 ''An Essay on the Impolicy of the African Slave Trade''.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 423 n31</ref> Kenneth Morgan characterizes the passage as \"a remark made in [Washington's] voice by David Humphreys.\"<ref name=Morgan2000p298 /> Fritz Hirschfeld writes that the passage was written by Humphreys during direct dictation or from memory of Washington's exact words, and believes it highly improbable that they were not Washington's own words.<ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 213 n5</ref>}}\n\n====As President====\n{{See also|Presidency of George Washington}}\n[[File:George Washington 1795.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|''President George Washington'' by Gilbert Stuart (1795) |alt=Portrait painting]]\nWashington took up the presidency at a time when revolutionary sentiment against slavery was giving way to a resurgence of proslavery interests.

This plan would have involved breaking up slave families, but it was designed with an end goal of raising enough finances to fund their eventual emancipation (a detail Washington kept secret) and prevent the Custis heirs from permanently splitting up families by sale.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 339\u2013342</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 303\u2013304</ref>{{efn|The dower slaves had already begun to be transferred to Martha's granddaughters as the Custis heirs married.

Peter had begun selling off slaves soon after his marriage, splitting up families and systematically separating girls as young as four years old from their parents. Wiencek suggests Martha's servant [[Oney Judge|Ona Judge]], who as a dower slave was destined to become Custis property, fled from Philadelphia in 1796 to avoid being sold.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 338\u2013342</ref>}} None of these schemes could be realized because of his failure to sell or rent land at the right prices, the refusal of the Custis heirs to agree to them and his own reluctance to separate families.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 423\u2013424</ref><ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 342</ref> Wiencek speculates that, because Washington gave such serious consideration to freeing his slaves knowing full well the political ramifications that would follow, one of his goals was to make a public statement that would sway opinion towards abolition.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 342\u2013343</ref> Philip Morgan argues that Washington freeing his slaves while President in 1794 or 1796 would have had no profound effect, and would have been greeted with public silence and private derision by white southerners.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 428\u2013429</ref>\n\nAs Washington subordinated his desire for emancipation to his efforts to secure financial independence, he took care to retain his slaves.<ref>Ellis 2004 pp. 258\u2013260</ref> In 1791, he arranged for those who served in his personal retinue while he was President in Philadelphia to be rotated out of the state before they became eligible for emancipation after six months residence per [[An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery|Pennsylvanian law]]. Not only would Washington have been deprived of their services if they were freed, most of the slaves he took with him to Philadelphia were dower slaves, which meant that he would have had to compensate the Custis estate for the loss. Because of his concerns for his public image and that the prospect of emancipation would generate discontent among the slaves before they became eligible for emancipation, he instructed that they be shuffled back to Mount Vernon \"under pretext that may deceive both them and the Public.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 59\u201360</ref>\n\nWashington spared no expense in efforts to recover Hercules and Judge when they absconded. In Judge's case, Washington persisted for three years. He tried to persuade her to return when his agent eventually tracked her to New Hampshire, but refused to promise her freedom after his death; \"However well disposed I might be to a gradual emancipation,\" he said, \"or even to an entire emancipation of that description of People (if the latter was in itself practicable at this moment) it would neither be politic or just to reward unfaithfulness with a premature preference.\" Both Hercules and Judge eluded capture.<ref name=\"Ellis 2004 p. 260\"/> Washington's search for a new chef to replace Hercules in 1797 is the last known instance in which he considered buying a slave, despite his resolve \"never to become the Master of another Slave by purchase\"; in the end he chose to hire a white chef.<ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 15</ref>\n\n==Posthumous emancipation==\n[[File:GW-will.jpg|thumb|Washington's will published in the Connecticut Journal, February 20, 1800|alt=newspaper clipping]]\nIn July 1799, five months before his death, Washington wrote his will, in which he stipulated that his slaves should be freed. In the months that followed, he considered a plan that betrayed a continuing prioritization of profit above his concerns about the institution of slavery. The plan involved repossessing tenancies in [[Berkeley County, West Virginia|Berkeley]] and [[Frederick County, Virginia|Frederick]] Counties and transferring half of his Mount Vernon slaves to work them. It would, Washington hoped, \"yield more nett profit\" which might \"benefit myself and not render the [slaves'] condition worse\", despite the disruption such relocation would have had on the slave families. The plan died with Washington on December 14, 1799.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 404, 424</ref>{{efn|Philip Morgan speculates on the unlikely possibility that, had the plan proved profitable, Washington might have changed his will and retracted the manumission of his slaves.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 425</ref>}}\n\nWashington's slaves were the subjects of the longest provisions in the twenty-nine-page will, taking three pages in which his instructions were more forceful than in the rest of the document. His valet, William Lee, was freed immediately and his remaining 123 slaves were to be emancipated on the death of Martha.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 5</ref><ref name=Morgan2005p404 /> The deferral was intended to postpone the pain of separation that would occur when his slaves were freed but their spouses among the dower slaves remained in bondage, a situation which affected twenty couples and their children. It is possible Washington hoped Martha and her heirs who would inherit the dower slaves would solve this problem by following his example and emancipating them.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 354</ref><ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 216</ref><ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 309\"/> Those too old or infirm to work were to be supported by his estate, as mandated by state law. Washington went beyond the legal requirement to support and maintain younger slaves until adulthood, stipulating that those children whose education could not be undertaken by parents were to be taught reading, writing and a useful trade by their masters and then be freed at the age of twenty-five.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 294</ref> Washington was particularly pointed in forbidding the sale or transportation of any of his slaves out of Virginia before their emancipation.<ref name=Morgan2005p404 /> Including the Dandridge slaves, who were emancipated under similar terms, more than 160 slaves were freed.<ref name=\"Morgan2005pp404\u2013405\" /><ref name=gwpapers /> Although he was not alone among Virginian slaveowners in freeing their slaves, he was the only Founding Father to do so.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 427</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Slave Memorial - Mt.

By 1812, Free Town in [[Truro Parish, Virginia|Truro Parish]], the earliest known free African-American settlement in Fairfax County, contained seven households of former Washington slaves. By the mid 1800s, a son of Washington's carpenter Davy Jones and two grandsons of his [[postilion]] Joe Richardson had each bought land in Virginia. Francis Lee, younger brother of William, was well known and respected enough to have his obituary printed in the ''Alexandria Gazette'' on his death at Mount Vernon in 1821. Sambo Anderson{{snd}}who hunted game, as he had while Washington's slave, and prospered for a while by selling it to the most respectable families in Alexandria{{snd}}was similarly noted by the ''Gazette'' when he died near Mount Vernon in 1845.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 317\u2013319</ref> Research published in 2019 has concluded that Hercules worked as a cook in New York, where he died on May 15, 1812.<ref>Ganeshram 2019</ref>\n\nA decade after Washington's death, the Pennsylvanian jurist [[Richard Peters (Continental Congress)|Richard Peters]] wrote that Washington's servants \"were devoted to him; and especially those more immediately about his person.

Washington \"disdained to hold his fellow-creatures in abject domestic servitude,\" wrote the Massachusetts Federalist [[Timothy Bigelow (lawyer)|Timothy Bigelow]] before calling on \"fellow-citizens in the South\" to emulate Washington's example. In this narrative, Washington was a proto-abolitionist who, having added the freedom of his slaves to the freedom from British slavery he had won for the nation, would be mobilized to serve the antislavery cause.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 84\u201386</ref>\n\nAn alternative narrative more in line with proslavery sentiments embraced rather than excised Washington's ownership of slaves. Washington was cast as a paternal figure, the benevolent father not only of his country but also of a family of slaves bound to him by affection rather than coercion.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 92\u201394</ref> In this narrative, slaves idolized Washington and wept at his deathbed, and in an 1807 biography, [[Aaron Bancroft]] wrote, \"In domestick{{sic}} and private life, he blended the authority of the master with the care and kindness of the guardian and friend.\"<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 94, 96\u201397</ref> The competing narratives allowed both [[Union (American Civil War)|North]] and [[Confederate States of America|South]] to claim Washington as the father of their countries during the [[American Civil War]] that ended slavery more than half a century after his death.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 100\u2013101</ref>\n\n===Memorial===\nIn 1929, a plaque was embedded in the ground at Mount Vernon less than {{convert|50|yd|m|round=5}} from the crypt housing the remains of Washington and Martha, marking a plot neglected by both groundsmen and tourist guides where slaves had been buried in unmarked graves.

[[Slavery in the colonial United States|Slavery]] was ingrained in the economic and social fabric of [[Colony of Virginia|colonial Virginia]], and [[George Washington|Washington]] inherited his first ten slaves at the age of eleven on the death of his father in 1743. In adulthood his personal slaveholding grew through inheritance, purchase and natural increase. In 1759, he gained control of [[Dowry|dower]] slaves belonging to the Custis estate on his marriage to [[Martha Dandridge Custis]]. Washington's early attitudes to slavery reflected the prevailing Virginia [[Planter class|planter]] views of the day, and so he demonstrated no moral qualms about the institution. He became skeptical about the economic efficacy of slavery before the [[American Revolutionary War]], and expressed support in private for abolition by a gradual legislative process after the war. Washington remained dependent on slave labor, and by the time of his death in 1799 there were 317 slaves at his [[Mount Vernon]] estate, 124 owned by Washington and the remainder managed by him as his own property but belonging to other people.\n\nWashington was a demanding master. He provided his slaves with basic food, clothing and accommodation comparable to general practice at the time but not always adequate, and with medical care. In return, he expected them to work diligently from sunrise to sunset over the six-day working week that was standard at the time. Some three-quarters of the slaves labored in the fields, while the remainder worked at the main residence as domestic servants and artisans. They supplemented their diet by hunting, trapping, and growing vegetables in their free time, and bought extra rations, clothing and housewares with income from the sale of game and produce. They built their own community around marriage and family, though because Washington allocated slaves to farms according to the demands of the business without regard for their relationships, many husbands lived separately from their wives and children. Washington used both reward and punishment to encourage and discipline his slaves, but was constantly disappointed when they failed to meet his exacting standards. They resisted enslavement by various means, including theft to supplement food and clothing and as another source of income, by feigning illness, and by running away.\n\nWashington's first doubts about slavery were entirely economic, prompted by his transition from tobacco to grain crops in the 1760s which left him with a costly surplus of slaves. As commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in 1775, he initially refused to accept African-Americans, free or slave, into the ranks, but reversed this position due to the demands of war. The first indication of moral doubt appeared during efforts to sell some of his slaves in 1778, when Washington expressed distaste for selling them at a public venue and his desire that slave families not be split up as a result of the sale. His public words and deeds at the end of the American Revolutionary War in 1783 betrayed no antislavery sentiments. Politically, Washington was concerned that such a divisive issue as [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] should not threaten national unity, and he never spoke publicly about the institution. Privately, Washington considered freeing all the slaves he controlled in the mid-1790s, but could not realize this because of his failure to secure his own financial security and the refusal of his family to cooperate. His will provided for the emancipation of his own slaves, and he was the only [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father]] to do this. Because many of his slaves were married to Martha's dower slaves, whom he could not legally free, Washington stipulated that, with the exception of his valet William Lee who was freed immediately, his slaves be emancipated on the death of Martha. She freed them in 1801, a year before her own death, but her dower slaves were passed to her grandchildren and remained in bondage.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|History of slavery in Virginia}}\n[[File:The Leading Facts of American History (1910) - The First Negro Slaves Brought to Virginia.png|thumb|First slaves arriving in Virginia|alt=Black and white illustration]]\nSlavery was introduced into the English [[colony of Virginia]] when the first Africans were transported to [[Old Point Comfort|Point Comfort]] in 1619. Those who accepted Christianity became \"Christian servants\" with time-limited servitude, or even freed, but this mechanism for ending bondage was gradually shut down. In 1667, the [[Virginia General Assembly|Virginia Assembly]] passed a law that barred [[baptism]] as a means of conferring freedom. Africans who had been baptised before arriving in Virginia could be granted the status of [[Indentured servitude|indentured servant]] until 1682, when another law declared them to be slaves. Whites and people of African descent in the lowest stratum of Virginian society shared common disadvantages and a common lifestyle, which included intermarriage until the Assembly made such unions punishable by banishment in 1691.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 41\u201343</ref>\n\nIn 1671, Virginia counted 6,000 white indentured servants among its 40,000 population but only 2,000 people of African descent, up to a third of whom in some counties were free. Towards the end of the 17th century, British policy shifted in favor of retaining cheap labor rather than shipping it to the colonies, and the supply of indentured servants in Virginia began to dry up; by 1715, annual immigration was in the hundreds, compared with 1,500\u20132,000 in the 1680s. As tobacco planters put more land under cultivation, they made up the shortfall in labor with increasing numbers of slaves. The institution was rooted in race with the [[Virginia Slave Codes of 1705]], and from around 1710 the growth in the slave population was fueled by natural increase. Between 1700 and 1750 the number of slaves in the colony increased from 13,000 to 105,000, nearly eighty percent of them born in Virginia.<ref>Wiencek 2003 43\u201346</ref> In Washington's lifetime, slavery was deeply ingrained in the economic and social fabric of Virginia, where some forty percent of the population and virtually all African Americans were enslaved.<ref>Henriques 2008 p. 146</ref>\n\nGeorge Washington was born February 22, 1732, the first child of his father [[Augustine Washington|Augustine]]'s second marriage. Augustine was a tobacco planter with some {{convert|10,000|acre|ha}} of land and 50 slaves. On his death in 1743, he left his {{convert|2,500|acre|ha|adj=on}} Little Hunting Creek to George's older half-brother [[Lawrence Washington (1718\u20131752)|Lawrence]], who renamed it [[Mount Vernon]]. Washington inherited the {{convert|260|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[Ferry Farm]] and ten slaves.<ref>Chernow 2010 pp. 22\u201328</ref> He leased Mount Vernon from Lawrence's widow two years after his brother's death in 1752 and inherited it in 1761.<ref>Chernow 2010 pp. 82, 137</ref> He was an aggressive land speculator, and by 1774 he had amassed some {{convert|32,000|acre|ha}} of land in the [[Ohio Country]] on Virginia's western frontier.

Horses and mules were bred in stables there, and tropical plants were grown in a greenhouse. Trades such as blacksmithing, carpentry, barrel making (coopering), food production and preservation, spinning, weaving and shoe making were carried out in other buildings at Mansion House Farm. Some crops were grown at this farm, but the main agricultural business was conducted at the four outlying farms located in a radius of between {{convert|1+1/2|mi|km|spell=in}} and {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} from the mansion: Dogue Run Farm, Muddy Hole Farm, Union Farm (formed from the earlier Ferry Farm and French's Farm) and River Farm.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 4</ref> A farm manager responsible for the running of the estate reported directly to Washington, while an overseer was employed at each of the farms.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 78\u201379</ref>}}\n\n[[File:A Map of Washington's Farms at Mt.

They were kept busy year round, their tasks varying with the season.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 117\u2013118</ref> The remainder worked as domestic servants in the main residence or as artisans, such as carpenters, [[joiner]]s, [[Cooper (profession)|coopers]], [[Hand spinning|spinners]] and seamstresses.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 109\u2013111</ref> Between 1766 and 1799, seven dower slaves worked at one time or another as overseers.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 86, 343\u2013344</ref> Slaves were expected to work from sunrise to sunset over a six-day work week that was standard on Virginia plantations. With two hours off for meals, their workdays would range between seven and a half hours to thirteen hours, depending on season. They were given three or four days off at Christmas and a day each at Easter and [[Whitsunday]].<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 106\u2013107, 122\u2013123</ref> Domestic slaves started early, worked into the evenings and did not necessarily have Sundays and holidays free.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 110, 124, 134</ref> On special occasions when slaves were required to put in extra effort, such as working through a holiday or bringing in the harvest, they were paid or compensated with extra time off.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 123\u2013124</ref>\n\nThere were elements of patriarchy and paternalism in Washington's attitudes to his workforce; he thought of his workers as part of an extended family in which he occupied the position of a father figure, with mutual obligations between master and servant.<ref>Morgan 2000 p. 282</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 45\u201348</ref> He instructed his overseers to treat slaves \"with humanity and tenderness\" when sick.<ref name=Morgan2005-410 /> Slaves who were less able, through injury, disability or age, were given light duties, while those too sick to work were generally, though not always, excused work while they recovered.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 120, 125</ref> Washington provided them with good, sometimes costly medical care{{snd}}when a slave named Cupid fell ill with [[pleurisy]], Washington had him taken to the main house where he could be better cared for and personally checked on him throughout the day.<ref name=Twohig117 /><ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 100</ref> The humanitarian concern for the welfare of his slaves was mixed with an economic consideration for the lost productivity arising from sickness and death among the labor force.<ref name=\"Twohig 2001 p. 116\">Twohig 2001 p. 116</ref><ref>Ellis 2004 p. 46</ref> Although Washington insisted on an emotional distance between master and slave, there are examples of genuine affection, such as was the case with his valet [[William Lee (valet)|William Lee]], and evidence that slaves were able to approach him with their concerns and grievances.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 51\u201353, 97</ref>\n\n===Living conditions===\n[[File:Slave cabin at pioneer farm - Mount Vernon.jpg|thumb|left|Modern reconstruction of a slave cabin at Mount Vernon|alt=Photograph]]\nAt Mansion House Farm, most slaves were housed in a two-story [[Framing (construction)|frame building]] known as the \"Quarters for Families\". This was replaced in 1792 by brick-built accommodation wings either side of the greenhouse comprising four rooms in total, each of some {{convert|600|sqft|m2}}. The [[Mount Vernon Ladies' Association]] have concluded these rooms were communal areas furnished with bunks that allowed little privacy for the predominantly male occupants. Other slaves at Mansion House Farm lived over the outbuildings where they worked or in log cabins.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 162\u2013164, 166\u2013167</ref> Such cabins were the standard slave accommodation at the outlying farms, comparable to the accommodation occupied by the lower strata of free white society across the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake area]] and by slaves on other Virginia plantations.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 162, 167, 169</ref> They provided a single room that ranged in size from 168 square feet (15.6 m2) to 246 square feet (22.9 m2) to house a family.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 168\u2013169</ref> The cabins were often poorly constructed, daubed with mud for draft- and water-proofing, with dirt floors. Some cabins were built as duplexes; some single-unit cabins were small enough to be moved on carts.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 168, 170</ref> There are few sources which shed light on living conditions in these cabins, but one visitor in 1798 wrote, \"husband and wife sleep on a mean pallet, the children on the ground; a very bad fireplace, some utensils for cooking, but in the middle of this poverty some cups and a teapot.\" Other sources suggest the interiors were smoky, dirty and dark, with only a shuttered opening for a window and the fireplace for illumination at night.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 170\u2013172</ref>\n\nWashington provided slaves with a blanket each fall at most, which they used for their own bedding and which they were required to use to gather leaves for livestock bedding.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 175\u2013176</ref> Slaves at the outlying farms were issued with a basic set of clothing each year, comparable to the clothing issued on other Virginia plantations. Slaves slept and worked in their clothes, leaving them to spend many months in garments that were worn, ripped and tattered.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 177\u2013178</ref> Domestic slaves at the main residence who came into regular contact with visitors were better clothed; butlers, waiters and body servants were dressed in a [[livery]] based on the three-piece suit of an 18th-century gentleman, and maids were provided with finer quality clothing than their counterparts in the fields.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 179\u2013181</ref>\n\nWashington desired his slaves to be fed adequately but no more.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 244\u2013245</ref> Each slave was provided with a basic daily food ration of {{convert|1|USqt|l|spell=in}} or more of [[cornmeal]], up to {{convert|8|oz|g|spell=in}} of herring and occasionally some meat, a fairly typical ration for slaves in Virginia that was adequate in terms of the calorie requirement for a young man engaged in moderately heavy agricultural labor but nutritionally deficient.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 221\u2013222, 245</ref> The basic ration was supplemented by slaves' own efforts hunting (for which some slaves were allowed guns) and trapping game. They grew their own vegetables in small garden plots they were permitted to maintain in their own time, on which they also reared poultry.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 229\u2013231</ref>\n\nWashington often tipped slaves on his visits to other estates, and it is likely that his own slaves were similarly rewarded by visitors to Mount Vernon. Slaves occasionally earned money through their normal work or for particular services rendered{{snd}}for example, Washington rewarded three of his own slaves with cash for good service in 1775, a slave received a fee for the care of a mare that was being bred in 1798 and the chef [[Hercules (chef)|Hercules]] profited well by selling slops from the presidential kitchen.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 193\u2013194</ref> Slaves also earned money from their own endeavors, by selling to Washington or at the market in [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] food they had caught or grown and small items they had made.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 197, 231</ref> They used the proceeds to purchase from Washington or the shops in Alexandria better clothing, housewares and extra provisions such as flour, pork, whiskey, tea, coffee and sugar.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 194, 195\u2013196, 232</ref>\n\n===Family and community===\n[[File:Slave Cabin interior 01 - Mount Vernon.jpg|thumb|Interior of the reconstructed slave cabin at Mount Vernon|alt=Photograph showing single bedding on a pallet on a dirt floor]]\nAlthough the law did not recognize slave marriages, Washington did, and by 1799 some two-thirds of the adult slaves at Mount Vernon were married.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 128</ref> To minimize time lost in getting to the workplace and thus increase productivity, slaves were accommodated at the farm on which they worked. Because of the unequal distribution of males and females across the five farms, slaves often found partners on different farms, and in their day to day lives husbands were routinely separated from their wives and children. Only thirty-six of the ninety-six married slaves at Mount Vernon in 1799 lived together, while thirty-eight had spouses who lived on separate farms and twenty-two had spouses who lived on other plantations.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 122</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 132\u2013133</ref> The evidence suggests couples that were separated did not regularly visit during the week, and doing so prompted complaints from Washington that slaves were too exhausted to work after such \"night walking\", leaving Saturday nights/Sundays and holidays as the main time such families could spend together.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 134, 136, 202</ref> Despite the stress and anxiety caused by this indifference to family stability{{snd}}on one occasion an overseer wrote that the separation of families \"seems like death to them\"{{snd}}marriage was the foundation on which slaves established their own community, and longevity in these unions was not uncommon.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 127, 130\u2013131, 132</ref><ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 123</ref>\n\nLarge families that covered multiple generations, along with their attendant marriages, were part of a slave community-building process that transcended ownership. Washington's head carpenter Isaac, for example, lived with his wife Kitty, a dower-slave milkmaid, at Mansion House Farm. The couple had nine daughters ranging in age from six to twenty-seven in 1799, and the marriages of four of those daughters had extended the family to other farms within and outside the Mount Vernon estate and produced three grandchildren.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 135\">Thompson 2019 p. 135</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 p. 421</ref> Children were born into slavery, their ownership determined by the ownership of their mothers.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 309\">Thompson 2019 p. 309</ref> The value attached to the birth of a slave child, if it was noted at all, is indicated in the weekly report of one overseer, which stated, \"Increase 9 Lambs & 1 male child of Lynnas.\" New mothers received a new blanket and three to five weeks of light duties to recover. An infant remained with its mother at her place of work.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 151\u2013152</ref> Older children, the majority of whom lived in single-parent households in which the mother worked from dawn to dusk, performed small family chores but were otherwise left to play largely unsupervised until they reached an age when they could begin to be put to work for Washington, usually somewhere between eleven and fourteen years old.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 158\u2013160</ref> In 1799, nearly sixty percent of the slave population was under nineteen years old and nearly thirty-five percent under nine.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 135\"/>\n\nThere is evidence that slaves passed on their African cultural values through telling stories, among them the tales of [[Br'er Rabbit]] which, with their origins in Africa and stories of a powerless individual triumphing through wit and intelligence over powerful authority, would have resonated with the slaves.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 203</ref> African-born slaves brought with them some of the religious rituals of their ancestral home, and there is an undocumented tradition of voodoo being practiced at one of the Mount Vernon farms.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 211\u2013213</ref> Although the slave condition made it impossible to adhere to the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], some slave names betray a Muslim cultural origin.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 213\u2013214</ref> [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] reached out to American-born slaves in Virginia, and some of the Mount Vernon slaves are known to have been christened before Washington acquired the estate. There is evidence in the historical record from 1797 that Mount Vernon slaves had contacts with [[Baptists]], [[Methodism|Methodists]] and [[Quakers]].<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 208\u2013209</ref> The three religions advocated abolition, raising hopes of freedom among the slaves, and the congregation of the Alexandria Baptist Church, founded in 1803, included slaves formerly owned by Washington.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 209, 210\u2013211</ref>\n\n===Mulattoes===\nIn 1799 there were some twenty [[mulatto]] (mixed race) slaves at Mount Vernon. The probability of paternal relationships between slaves and hired white workers is indicated by some surnames: Betty and Tom Davis, probably the children of Thomas Davis, a white weaver at Mount Vernon in the 1760s; George Young, likely the son of a man of the same name who was a clerk at Mount Vernon in 1774; and [[Oney Judge]] and her sister Delphy, the daughters of Andrew Judge, an indentured tailor at Mount Vernon in the 1770s and 1780s.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 136, 138\u2013139</ref> There is evidence to suggest that white overseers{{snd}}working in close proximity to slaves under the same demanding master and physically and socially isolated from their own peer group, a situation that drove some to drink{{snd}}indulged in sexual relations with the slaves they supervised.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 140\u2013141</ref> Some white visitors to Mount Vernon seemed to have expected slave women to provide sexual favors.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 141\u2013142</ref> The living arrangements left some slave females alone and vulnerable, and the Mount Vernon research historian Mary V. Thompson writes that relationships \"could have been the result of mutual attraction and affection, very real demonstrations of power and control, or even exercises in the manipulation of an authority figure.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 136, 140</ref>{{efn|There is an oral tradition among the descendants of the freedman [[West Ford (slave)|West Ford]] that he was the son of Washington and Venus, a slave belonging to Washington's brother [[John Augustine Washington]]. A case made by the historian Henry Wiencek is, according to the historian Philip Morgan, \"so circumstantial as to be fanciful,\" and there is no evidence that Washington ever met Venus, let alone fathered a child by her.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 147\u2013151</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 419, 420 n26</ref>}}\n\n===Resistance===\n[[File:Oney Judge Runaway Ad.jpg|thumb|left|Advertisement placed in the ''Pennsylvania Gazette'' after Oney Judge absconded from the President's House in 1796|alt=Newspaper clipping]]\nThe frequent comments Washington made about \"rogueries\" and \"old tricks\" indicate the resistance displayed by the slaves against the system.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 261</ref> The most common act of resistance was theft, so common that Washington made allowances for it as part of normal wastage. Food was stolen both to supplement rations and to sell, and Washington believed the selling of tools was another source of income for slaves. Because cloth and clothing were commonly stolen, Washington required seamstresses to show the results of their work and the leftover scraps before issuing them with more material. Sheep were washed before shearing to prevent the theft of wool, and storage areas were kept locked and keys left with trusted individuals.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 269\u2013271</ref> In 1792, Washington ordered the culling of slaves' dogs he believed were being used in a spate of livestock theft and ruled that slaves who kept dogs without authorization were to be \"severely punished\" and their dogs hanged.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 201</ref>\n\nAnother means by which slaves resisted, one that was virtually impossible to prove, was feigning illness. Over the years Washington became increasingly skeptical about absenteeism due to sickness among his slaves and concerned about the diligence or ability of his overseers in recognizing genuine cases. Between 1792 and 1794, while Washington was away from Mount Vernon as President, the number of days lost to sickness increased tenfold compared to 1786, when he was resident at Mount Vernon and able to control the situation personally. In one case, Washington suspected a slave of frequently avoiding work over a period of decades through acts of deliberate self harm.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 261\u2013263, 264\u2013265</ref>\n\nSlaves asserted some independence and frustrated Washington by the pace and quality of their work.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 105, 265</ref> In 1760, Washington noted that four of his carpenters quadrupled their output of timber under his personal supervision.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 93\u201394</ref> Thirty-five years later, he described his carpenters as an \"idle...set of rascals\" who would take a month or more to complete at Mount Vernon work that was being done in two or three days in [[Philadelphia]]. The output of seamstresses dropped off when Martha was away, and spinners found they could slacken by playing the overseers off against her.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 266\u2013267</ref> Tools were regularly lost or damaged, thus stopping work, and Washington despaired of employing innovations that might improve efficiency because he believed the slaves were too clumsy to operate the new machinery involved.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 266, 268</ref>\n\nThe most emphatic act of resistance was to run away, and between 1760 and 1799 at least forty-seven slaves under Washington's control did so.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 275</ref> Seventeen of these, fourteen men and three women, escaped to a British warship that anchored in the [[Potomac River]] near Mount Vernon in 1781.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 278, 279</ref> In general, the best chance of success lay with second- or third-generation African-American slaves who had good English, possessed skills that would allow them to support themselves as free people and were in close enough contact with their masters to receive special privileges. Thus it was that Judge, an especially talented seamstress, and Hercules escaped in 1796 and 1797 respectively and eluded recapture.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 281, 284\u2013286</ref> Washington took seriously the recapture of fugitives, and in three cases an escaped slave was sold off in the West Indies after recapture, effectively a death sentence in the severe conditions slaves had to endure there.<ref name=\"Wiencek 2003 p. 132\">Wiencek 2003 p. 132</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 411\u2013412</ref><ref>Chernow 2010 p. 161</ref>\n\n===Control===\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|salign=right\n|width=25%\n|quote=Slavery was a system in which enslaved people lived in fear; fear of being sold, fear of being separated from their families or their children or their parents, fear of not being in control of their bodies or their lives, fear of never knowing freedom.

And that was the psychological violence of slavery.

Rewards in the form of better blankets and clothing fabric were given to the \"most deserving\", and there are examples of cash payments being awarded for good behavior.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 259\u2013260</ref> He opposed the use of the lash in principle, but saw the practice as a necessary evil and sanctioned its occasional use, generally as a last resort, on both male and female slaves if they did not, in his words, \"do their duty by fair means.\"<ref name=Hirschfeld36 /> There are accounts of carpenters being whipped in 1758 when the overseer \"could see a fault\", of a slave called Jemmy being whipped for stealing corn and escaping in 1773 and of a seamstress called Charlotte being whipped in 1793 by an overseer \"determined to lower Spirit or skin her Back\" for impudence and refusing to work.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 125</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 248, 432 n6 & n7</ref>\n\nWashington regarded the \"passion\" with which one of his overseers administered floggings to be counter-productive, and Charlotte's protest that she had not been whipped in fourteen years indicates the frequency with which physical punishment was used.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 125\u2013126</ref><ref>MVLA Resistance & Punishment</ref> Whippings were administered by overseers after review, a system Washington required to ensure slaves were spared capricious and extreme punishment.

By 1766, he had transitioned his business from the labor-intensive planting of tobacco to the less demanding farming of grain crops. His slaves were employed on a greater variety of tasks that needed more skills than tobacco planting required of them; as well as the cultivation of grains and vegetables, they were employed in cattle herding, spinning, weaving and carpentry. The transition left Washington with a surplus of slaves and revealed to him the inefficiencies of the slave labor system.<ref name=Morgan2005p413>Morgan 2005 p. 413</ref><ref name=Twohig118>Twohig 2001 p. 118</ref>\n\nThere is little evidence that Washington seriously questioned the ethics of slavery before the Revolution.<ref name=Twohig118 /> In the 1760s he often participated in tavern lotteries, events in which defaulters' debts were settled by raffling off their assets to a high-spirited crowd.<ref>Chernow 2010 p. 162</ref> In 1769, Washington co-managed one such lottery in which fifty-five slaves were sold, among them six families and five females with children. The more valuable married males were raffled together with their wives and children; less valuable slaves were separated from their families into different lots. Robin and Bella, for example, were raffled together as husband and wife while their children, twelve-year-old Sukey and seven-year-old Betty, were listed in a separate lot. Only chance dictated whether the family would remain together, and with 1,840 tickets on sale the odds were not good.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 178\u2013180</ref>\n\nThe historian [[Henry Wiencek]] concludes that the repugnance Washington felt at this cruelty in which he had participated prompted his decision not to break up slave families by sale or purchase, and marks the beginning of a transformation in Washington's thinking about the morality of slavery.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 135, 188</ref> Wiencek writes that in 1775 Washington took more slaves than he needed rather than break up the family of a slave he had agreed to accept in payment of a debt.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 188</ref> The historians [[Philip D.

Morgan writes that in 1772, Washington was \"all business\" and \"might have been buying livestock\" in purchasing more slaves who were to be, in Washington's words, \"strait Limb'd, & in every respect strong & likely, with good Teeth & good Countenance.\" Morgan gives a different account of the 1775 purchase, writing that Washington resold the slave because of the slave's resistance to being separated from family and that the decision to do so was \"no more than the conventional piety of large Virginia planters who usually said they did not want to break up slave families{{snd}}and often did it anyway.\"<ref name=Morgan2005p412>Morgan 2005 p. 412</ref><ref name=Henriques159>Henriques 2008 p. 159</ref>\n\n===American Revolution===\n[[File:List of George Washington's taxable property in Truro Parish Virginia including slaves 1788.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Washington's taxable property in April 1788: 121 slaves, 98 horses, 4 mules and a chariot|alt=Original document]]\nFrom the late 1760s, Washington became increasingly radicalized against the North American colonies' subservient status within the [[British Empire]].<ref>Ferling 2009 p. 69</ref> In 1774 he was a key participant in the adoption of the [[Fairfax Resolves]] which, alongside the assertion of colonial rights, condemned the [[Atlantic slave trade|transatlantic slave trade]] on moral grounds.<ref>Ferling 2009 p. 75</ref><ref name=Twohig118 /> He began to express the growing rift with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] in terms of slavery, stating in the summer of 1774 that the British authorities were \"endeavouring by every piece of Art & despotism to fix the Shackles of Slavry{{sic}}\" upon the colonies. Two years later, on taking command of the [[Continental Army]] at Cambridge at the start of the [[American Revolutionary War]], he wrote in orders to his troops that \"it is a noble Cause we are engaged in, it is the Cause of virtue and mankind...freedom or Slavery must be the result of our conduct.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 p.64</ref> The hypocrisy inherent in slave owners characterizing a war of independence as a struggle for their own freedom from slavery was not lost on the British writer [[Samuel Johnson]], who asked, \"How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of Negroes?\"<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 191</ref>\n\nWashington shared the common southern concern about arming African-Americans or slaves and initially refused to accept either into the ranks of the Continental Army. He reversed his position on the recruitment of free African-Americans when the royal governor of Virginia, [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]], issued a [[Dunmore's Proclamation|proclamation]] in November 1775 offering freedom to rebel-owned slaves who enlisted in the British forces.

He sought to liberate himself from an economically unviable system, not to liberate his slaves. They were still a property from which he expected to profit.

On returning to France, Lafayette purchased a plantation in the French colony of Cayenne, modern-day [[French Guiana]], and advised Washington of his progress by letter in 1786. Lafayette had taken concerns about the abrupt emancipation of slaves into account, paying and educating the slaves he settled on the plantation before freeing them. He became a leading figure in the French movement against the slave trade and a corresponding member of the British movement. Washington would not have known of Lafayette's antislavery activities in Cayenne or Europe from Lafayette himself; although the two continued to correspond for the rest of Washington's life, the subject of slavery virtually disappeared from their letters. The Cayenne experiment came to an end in 1792, when the plantation was sold by the French Revolutionary government after Lafayette's imprisonment by the Austrians.<ref>Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 122\u2013128</ref><ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 261\u2013264</ref>}} Washington privately expressed support for emancipation to prominent Methodists [[Thomas Coke (bishop)|Thomas Coke]] and [[Francis Asbury]] in 1785, but declined to sign their petition.

He presided over the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in 1787, during which it became obvious just how explosive the issue was and how willing the antislavery faction was to accept the preservation of slavery to ensure national unity and the establishment of a strong federal government. The support of the southern states for the new constitution was secured by granting them concessions that protected slavery, including the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]] and the [[Fugitive Slave Clause]], plus clauses that guaranteed the transatlantic slave trade for at least twenty years and federal aid for the suppression of any slave rebellion.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 422</ref><ref>Twohig 2001 pp. 124\u2013125</ref>\n\nWashington's preeminent position ensured that any actions he took with regard to his own slaves would become a statement in a national debate about slavery that threatened to divide the country. Wiencek suggests Washington considered making precisely such a statement on taking up the presidency in 1789. A passage in the notebook of Washington's biographer [[David Humphreys (soldier)|David Humphreys]]{{efn|Humphreys was a former aide to Washington and had begun an eighteen-month stay at Mount Vernon in 1787 to assist Washington with his correspondence and write his biography.<ref>Ellis 2004 p. 153</ref>}} dated to late 1788 or early 1789 recorded a statement that resembled the emancipation clause in Washington's will a decade later. Wiencek argues the passage was a draft for a public announcement Washington was considering in which he would declare the emancipation of some of his slaves. It marks, Wiencek believes, a moral epiphany in Washington's thinking, the moment he decided not only to emancipate his slaves but also to use the occasion to set the example Lafayette had urged in 1783.<ref name=\"Wiencek272\u2013275\">Wiencek 2003 pp. 272\u2013275</ref> Other historians dispute Wiencek's conclusion; Henriques and [[Joseph Ellis]] concur with Philip Morgan's opinion that Washington experienced no epiphanies in a \"long and hard-headed struggle\" in which there was no single turning point. Morgan argues that Humphreys' passage is the \"private expression of remorse\" from a man unable to extricate himself from the \"tangled web\" of \"mutual dependency\" on slavery, and that Washington believed public comment on such a divisive subject was best avoided for the sake of national unity.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 421\u2013423, 425</ref><ref>Ellis 2004 p. 311 n22</ref><ref name=Henriques159 />{{efn|Wiencek bases his argument on the fact that the passage was written in the past tense and appears in Humphreys' notebook amid drafts Humphreys had written for public statements Washington was to make about assuming the presidency.<ref name=\"Wiencek272\u2013275\" /> Philip Morgan points out that the passage was Humphreys' words in Washington's voice and appears just after a summary Humphreys had written of [[Thomas Clarkson]]'s 1788 ''An Essay on the Impolicy of the African Slave Trade''.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 423 n31</ref> Kenneth Morgan characterizes the passage as \"a remark made in [Washington's] voice by David Humphreys.\"<ref name=Morgan2000p298 /> Fritz Hirschfeld writes that the passage was written by Humphreys during direct dictation or from memory of Washington's exact words, and believes it highly improbable that they were not Washington's own words.<ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 213 n5</ref>}}\n\n====As President====\n{{See also|Presidency of George Washington}}\n[[File:George Washington 1795.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|''President George Washington'' by Gilbert Stuart (1795) |alt=Portrait painting]]\nWashington took up the presidency at a time when revolutionary sentiment against slavery was giving way to a resurgence of proslavery interests. No state considered making slavery an issue during the ratification of the new constitution, southern states reinforced their slavery legislation and prominent antislavery figures were muted about the issue in public. Washington understood there was little widespread organized support for abolition.<ref>Twohig 2001 pp. 125\u2013126</ref> He had a keen sense both of the fragility of the fledgling Republic and of his place as a unifying figure, and he was determined not to endanger either by confronting an issue as divisive and entrenched as slavery.<ref>Twohig 2001 pp. 126\u2013128</ref><ref>Morgan 2000 pp. 290, 295</ref> He was president of a government that passed a resolution in 1790 affirming states' rights to regulate treatment of slaves and legislate on slavery free of congressional interference, provided materiel and financial support for French efforts to suppress the [[Haitian Revolution|Saint Domingue slave revolt]] in 1791 and implemented the proslavery [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1793]].<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 275\u2013276</ref><ref>Twohig 2001 p. 130</ref><ref name=Morgan2000-297>Morgan 2000 p. 297</ref> He also signed into law the [[Slave Trade Act of 1794]] that sought to limit American involvement in the [[Atlantic slave trade|international slave trade]].<ref>Stathis 2014 pp. 17\u201318</ref> Washington never spoke publicly on the issue of slavery during his eight years as president, nor did he respond to, much less act upon, any of the antislavery petitions he received. He described a 1790 Quaker petition to [[United States Congress|Congress]] urging an immediate end to the slave trade as \"an illjudged piece of business\" that \"occasioned a great waste of time.\" The issue of slavery was not mentioned in either his last address to Congress or his [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]].<ref>Twohig 2001 p. 126</ref><ref>Boller 1961 pp. 85, 87</ref><ref>Ferling 2009 p. 363</ref>\n\nLate in his presidency, Washington told his [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[Edmund Randolph]], that in the event of a confrontation between North and South, he had \"made up his mind to remove and be of the Northern.\"<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 362</ref> In 1798, he imagined just such a conflict when he said, \"I can clearly foresee that nothing but the rooting out of slavery can perpetuate the existence of our union.\"<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 361\u2013362</ref><ref name=\"Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 72\u201373\"/> But there is no indication Washington ever favored an immediate end to slavery.

This plan would have involved breaking up slave families, but it was designed with an end goal of raising enough finances to fund their eventual emancipation (a detail Washington kept secret) and prevent the Custis heirs from permanently splitting up families by sale.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 339\u2013342</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 303\u2013304</ref>{{efn|The dower slaves had already begun to be transferred to Martha's granddaughters as the Custis heirs married.

The plan involved repossessing tenancies in [[Berkeley County, West Virginia|Berkeley]] and [[Frederick County, Virginia|Frederick]] Counties and transferring half of his Mount Vernon slaves to work them. It would, Washington hoped, \"yield more nett profit\" which might \"benefit myself and not render the [slaves'] condition worse\", despite the disruption such relocation would have had on the slave families.

Five freedwomen were listed as remaining: an unmarried mother of two children; two women, one of them with three children, married to Washington slaves too old to work; and two women who were married to dower slaves.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 311\u2013312</ref> William Lee remained at Mount Vernon, where he worked as a shoemaker.<ref>Schwartz 2017 p. 27</ref> After Martha's death on May 22, 1802, most of the remaining dower slaves passed to her grandson, [[George Washington Parke Custis]], to whom she bequeathed the only slave she held in her own name.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 341, 358</ref>\n\nThere are few records of how the newly freed slaves fared.<ref>Schwartz 2017 p. 35</ref> Custis later wrote that \"although many of them, with a view to their liberation, had been instructed in mechanic trades, yet they succeeded very badly as freemen; so true is the axiom, 'that the hour which makes man a slave, takes half his worth away'.\" The son-in-law of Custis's sister wrote in 1853 that the descendants of those who remained slaves, many of them now in his possession, had been \"prosperous, contented and happy,\" while those who had been freed had led a life of \"vice, dissipation and idleness\" and had, in their \"sickness, age and poverty\", become a burden to his in-laws.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 316</ref> Such reports were influenced by the innate racism of the well-educated, upper-class authors and ignored the social and legal impediments that prejudiced the chances of prosperity for former slaves, which included laws that made it illegal to teach freedpeople to read and write and, in 1806, required newly freed slaves to leave the state.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 317, 449 n83</ref><ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 215</ref>\n\nThere is evidence that some of Washington's former slaves were able to buy land, support their families and prosper as free people. By 1812, Free Town in [[Truro Parish, Virginia|Truro Parish]], the earliest known free African-American settlement in Fairfax County, contained seven households of former Washington slaves. By the mid 1800s, a son of Washington's carpenter Davy Jones and two grandsons of his [[postilion]] Joe Richardson had each bought land in Virginia. Francis Lee, younger brother of William, was well known and respected enough to have his obituary printed in the ''Alexandria Gazette'' on his death at Mount Vernon in 1821. Sambo Anderson{{snd}}who hunted game, as he had while Washington's slave, and prospered for a while by selling it to the most respectable families in Alexandria{{snd}}was similarly noted by the ''Gazette'' when he died near Mount Vernon in 1845.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 317\u2013319</ref> Research published in 2019 has concluded that Hercules worked as a cook in New York, where he died on May 15, 1812.<ref>Ganeshram 2019</ref>\n\nA decade after Washington's death, the Pennsylvanian jurist [[Richard Peters (Continental Congress)|Richard Peters]] wrote that Washington's servants \"were devoted to him; and especially those more immediately about his person. The survivors of them still venerate and adore his memory.\" In his old age, Anderson said he was \"a much happier man when he was a slave than he had ever been since,\" because he then \"had a good kind master to look after all my wants, but now I have no one to care for me.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 322\u2013323</ref> When Judge was interviewed in the 1840s, she expressed considerable bitterness, not at the way she he had been treated as a slave, but at the fact that she had been enslaved. When asked, having experienced the hardships of being a freewoman and having outlived both husband and children, whether she regretted her escape, she replied, \"No, I am free, and have, I trust, been made a child of God by [that] means.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 288\u2013289</ref>\n\n===Political legacy===\nWashington's will was both private testament and public statement on the institution.<ref name=Morgan2005p404>Morgan 2005 p. 404</ref><ref name=Morgan2000p298>Morgan 2000 p. 298</ref> It was published widely{{snd}}in newspapers nationwide, as a pamphlet which, in 1800 alone, extended to thirteen separate editions, and included in other works{{snd}}and became part of the nationalist narrative.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 84\u201385</ref> In the eulogies of the antislavery faction, the inconvenient fact of Washington's slaveholding was downplayed in favor of his final act of emancipation. Washington \"disdained to hold his fellow-creatures in abject domestic servitude,\" wrote the Massachusetts Federalist [[Timothy Bigelow (lawyer)|Timothy Bigelow]] before calling on \"fellow-citizens in the South\" to emulate Washington's example. In this narrative, Washington was a proto-abolitionist who, having added the freedom of his slaves to the freedom from British slavery he had won for the nation, would be mobilized to serve the antislavery cause.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 84\u201386</ref>\n\nAn alternative narrative more in line with proslavery sentiments embraced rather than excised Washington's ownership of slaves. Washington was cast as a paternal figure, the benevolent father not only of his country but also of a family of slaves bound to him by affection rather than coercion.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 92\u201394</ref> In this narrative, slaves idolized Washington and wept at his deathbed, and in an 1807 biography, [[Aaron Bancroft]] wrote, \"In domestick{{sic}} and private life, he blended the authority of the master with the care and kindness of the guardian and friend.\"<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 94, 96\u201397</ref> The competing narratives allowed both [[Union (American Civil War)|North]] and [[Confederate States of America|South]] to claim Washington as the father of their countries during the [[American Civil War]] that ended slavery more than half a century after his death.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 100\u2013101</ref>\n\n===Memorial===\nIn 1929, a plaque was embedded in the ground at Mount Vernon less than {{convert|50|yd|m|round=5}} from the crypt housing the remains of Washington and Martha, marking a plot neglected by both groundsmen and tourist guides where slaves had been buried in unmarked graves. The inscription read, \"In memory of the many faithful colored servants of the Washington family, buried at Mount Vernon from 1760 to 1860. Their unidentified graves surround this spot.\" The site remained untended and ignored in the visitor literature until the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association erected a more prominent monument surrounded with plantings and inscribed, \"In memory of the Afro Americans who served as slaves at Mount Vernon this monument marking their burial ground dedicated September 21, 1983.\" In 1985, a [[ground-penetrating radar]] survey identified sixty-six possible burials. As of late 2017, an archaeological project begun in 2014 has identified, without disturbing the contents, sixty-three burial plots in addition to seven plots known before the project began.<ref>Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 217\u2013218</ref><ref>MVLA Slave Burial Ground Archaeology</ref><ref>MVLA Forgotten No Longer</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last=Chernow |first=Ron |authorlink=Ron Chernow |title=Washington, A Life |title-link=Washington: A Life |type=e-book |publisher=Allen Lane |location=London, United Kingdom |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-141-96610-6 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Ellis |first=Joseph J. |authorlink=Joseph Ellis |title=His Excellency: George Washington |publisher=Alfred A.

Decoration is limited for men, consisting of [[bead]] [[necklace]]s and [[armband]]s. Women wear a knee-length skirt of bark cloth, occasionally with a [[shawl]] of bark cloth covering the shoulders.

In keeping with the tropical climate of the islands, traditional attire includes only clothing below the waist.

Decoration is limited for men, consisting of [[bead]] [[necklace]]s and [[armband]]s. Women wear a knee-length skirt of bark cloth, occasionally with a [[shawl]] of bark cloth covering the shoulders. Decorations include bamboo [[ear plug]]s (''ahav''), bead necklaces (''naigaak'') and armbands of [[bamboo]] (''geegap''). Both sexes are [[barefoot]]. The Shompen probably learned to make and use [[bow and arrow|bows]] from the Nicobaris. The main weapons are the [[bow and arrow]]. They do not use quivers but carry [[arrow]]s by hand.

In contrast to the regular seasonal epidemics of influenza, these [[pandemic]]s occur irregularly&nbsp;\u2013 there have been five influenza pandemics during the last 140 years. Pandemics can cause high levels of mortality, with the [[1918 flu pandemic|1918 Spanish flu pandemic]] being the worst in recorded history; this pandemic was estimated to be responsible for the deaths of 50\u2013100&nbsp;million people. The most recent, the [[2009 flu pandemic]], resulted in under a million deaths and is considered relatively mild.\n\nInfluenza pandemics occur when a new strain of the influenza virus is transmitted to humans from another animal species. Species that are thought to be important in the emergence of new human strains are pigs, chickens and ducks.

Longer-term strategies proposed for regions where highly pathogenic H5N1 is endemic in wild birds have included:\n* changing local farming practices to increase farm hygiene and reduce contact between livestock and wild birds.\n* altering farming practices in regions where animals live in close, often unsanitary quarters with people, and changing the practices of open-air \"[[wet markets]]\" where birds are kept for live sale and slaughtered on-site. A challenge to implementing these measures is widespread poverty, frequently in rural areas, coupled with a reliance upon raising fowl for purposes of [[subsistence farming]] or income without measures to prevent propagation of the disease.\n* changing local shopping practices from purchase of live fowl to purchase of slaughtered, pre-packaged fowl.\n* improving veterinary [[vaccine]] availability and cost.<ref name=\"The Threat of Global Pandemics\"/>\n\n==Strategies to slow down a flu pandemic==\n{{See also|Flu research}}\n\n===Public response measures===\nThe main ways available to tackle a flu pandemic initially are behavioural.

Due to the high rate of side effects and risk of antiviral resistance, use of adamantanes to fight influenza is limited.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pandemic Influenza: Use of Antiviral Agents|url=http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/panflu/biofacts/panflu_antiviral.html|publisher=Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP)}}</ref>\n\nMany nations, as well as the World Health Organization, are working to stockpile [[anti-viral drug]]s in preparation for a possible pandemic. [[Oseltamivir]] is the most commonly sought drug, since it is available in pill form.  [[Zanamivir]] is also considered for use, but it must be inhaled. Other anti-viral drugs are less likely to be effective against pandemic influenza.\n\nBoth Tamiflu and Relenza are in short supply, and production capabilities are limited in the medium term. Some doctors say that co-administration of Tamiflu with [[probenecid]] could double supplies.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1038/438006a|pmid=16267514|title=Wartime tactic doubles power of scarce bird-flu drug|journal=Nature|volume=438|issue=7064|pages=6|year=2005|last1=Butler|first1=Declan|bibcode=2005Natur.438....6B|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nThere also is the potential of viruses to evolve drug resistance. Some H5N1-infected persons treated with oseltamivir have developed resistant strains of that virus.\n\nTamiflu was originally discovered by [[Gilead Sciences]] and licensed to Roche for late-phase development and marketing.\n\n===Vaccines===\nA [[vaccine]] probably would not be available in the initial stages of population infection.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/gen-info/pandemics.htm|title=Information on Avian Influenza|publisher=|date=21 March 2019}}</ref> A vaccine cannot be developed to protect against a virus which does not exist yet. The avian flu virus H5N1 has the potential to mutate into a pandemic strain, but so do other types of flu virus. Once a potential virus is identified and a vaccine is approved, it normally takes five to six months before the vaccine becomes available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/notes/h1n1_vaccine_20090806/en/|title= Pandemic influenza vaccine manufacturing process and timeline|website=www.WHO.int|access-date=19 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe capability to produce vaccines varies widely from country to country; only 19 countries are listed as \"influenza vaccine manufacturers\" according to the World Health Organization.<ref>{{cite web|title=Influenza vaccine manufacturers |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/manulist/en/index.html |access-date=13 September 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822222456/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/manulist/en/index.html |archivedate=22 August 2006 }}</ref> It is estimated that, in a best scenario situation, 750&nbsp;million doses could be produced each year, whereas it is likely that each individual would need two doses of the vaccine to become immuno-competent.

Cost considerations aside, they fear that the countries with vaccine-manufacturing capability will reserve production to protect their own populations and not release vaccines to other countries until their own population is protected. Indonesia has refused to share samples of H5N1 strains which have infected and killed its citizens until it receives assurances that it will have access to vaccines produced with those samples. So far, it has not received those assurances.<ref>{{cite web  | title = GAO cites barriers to antiviral, vaccine roles in pandemic  | publisher=CIDRAP  | url = http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/panflu/news/jan2308gao.html  | accessdate = 6 February 2007 }}</ref> However, in September 2009, The United States and France agreed to make 10 percent of their H1N1 vaccine supply available to other countries through the World Health Organization.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-flu-vaccine/u-s-to-offer-10-percent-of-h1n1-vaccine-internationally-idUSTRE58G4MW20090917|title=U.S. to offer 10 pct of H1N1 vaccine internationally|date=17 September 2009|publisher=|access-date=19 January 2018|newspaper=Reuters}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20090917-france-donate-swine-flu-vaccines-who-presidency|title=France to donate swine flu vaccines to WHO: presidency. 17 September 2009.|website=France24.com|access-date=19 January 2018}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThere are two serious technical problems associated with the development of a vaccine against H5N1. The first problem is this: seasonal influenza vaccines require a single injection of 15 \u03bcg haemagluttinin in order to give protection; H5 seems to evoke only a weak immune response and a large multicentre trial found that two injections of 90&nbsp;\u00b5g H5 given 28 days apart provided protection in only 54% of people {{Harv|Treanor|2006}}. Even if it is considered that 54% is an acceptable level of protection, the world is currently capable of producing only 900&nbsp;million doses at a strength of 15 \u03bcg (assuming that all production were immediately converted to manufacturing H5 vaccine); if two injections of 90 \u03bcg are needed then this capacity drops to only 70&nbsp;million {{Harv|Poland|2006}}.  Trials using [[adjuvant]]s such as [[alum]], [[AS03]], [[AS04]] or [[MF59]] to try and lower the dose of vaccine are urgently needed.  The second problem is this: there are two circulating [[clade]]s of virus, clade 1 is the virus originally isolated in Vietnam, clade 2 is the virus isolated in Indonesia. Vaccine research has mostly been focused on clade 1 viruses, but the clade 2 virus is antigenically distinct and a clade 1 vaccine will probably not protect against a pandemic caused by clade 2 virus.\n\nSince 2009, most vaccine development efforts have been focused on the current pandemic influenza virus H1N1. As of July 2009, more than 70 known clinical trials have been completed or are ongoing for pandemic influenza vaccines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/immunogenicity/immunogenicity_table.xls|title=World Health Organization.

The grouping and description of pandemic phases have been revised to make them easier to understand, more precise, and based upon observable phenomena. Phases 1\u20133 correlate with preparedness, including capacity development and response planning activities, while phases 4\u20136 clearly signal the need for response and mitigation efforts. Furthermore, periods after the first pandemic wave are elaborated to facilitate post pandemic recovery activities.\n\nIn February 2020, WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic explained that the WHO no longer uses this six-phase classification model: \"For the sake of clarification, WHO does not use the old system of 6 phases \u2014 that ranged from phase 1 (no reports of animal influenza causing human infections) to phase 6 (a pandemic) \u2014 that some people may be familiar with from H1N1 in 2009.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-china-health-who-idUKKCN20I0PD|title=WHO says it no longer uses 'pandemic' category, but virus still emergency|date=2020-02-24|work=Reuters|access-date=2020-02-29|language=en}}</ref>\n\nFor reference, the phases are defined below.<ref>{{cite news| title=Current WHO phase of pandemic alert| url =http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/phase/en/|publisher=WHO}}</ref>\n\nIn nature, influenza viruses circulate continuously among animals, especially birds. Even though such viruses might theoretically develop into pandemic viruses, in '''Phase 1''' no viruses circulating among animals have been reported to cause infections in humans.\n\nIn '''Phase 2''' an animal influenza virus circulating among domesticated or wild animals is known to have caused infection in humans, and is therefore considered a potential pandemic threat.\n\nIn '''Phase 3''', an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus has caused sporadic cases or small clusters of disease in people, but has not resulted in human-to-human transmission sufficient to sustain community-level outbreaks. Limited human-to-human transmission may occur under some circumstances, for example, when there is close contact between an infected person and an unprotected caregiver. However, limited transmission under such restricted circumstances does not indicate that the virus has gained the level of transmissibility among humans necessary to cause a pandemic.\n\n'''Phase 4''' is characterized by verified human-to-human transmission of an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus able to cause \"community-level outbreaks\". The ability to cause sustained disease outbreaks in a community marks a significant upwards shift in the risk for a pandemic. Any country that suspects or has verified such an event should urgently consult with the WHO so that the situation can be jointly assessed and a decision made by the affected country if implementation of a rapid pandemic containment operation is warranted. Phase 4 indicates a significant increase in risk of a pandemic but does not necessarily mean that a pandemic is a foregone conclusion.\n\n'''Phase 5''' is characterized by human-to-human spread of the virus into at least two countries in one WHO region. While most countries will not be affected at this stage, the declaration of Phase 5 is a strong signal that a pandemic is imminent and that the time to finalize the organization, communication, and implementation of the planned mitigation measures is short.\n\n'''Phase 6''', the pandemic phase, is characterized by community level outbreaks in at least one other country in a different WHO region in addition to the criteria defined in Phase 5. Designation of this phase will indicate that a global pandemic is under way.\n\nDuring the '''post-peak period''', pandemic disease levels in most countries with adequate surveillance will have dropped below peak observed levels. The post-peak period signifies that pandemic activity appears to be decreasing; however, it is uncertain if additional waves will occur and countries will need to be prepared for a second wave.\n\nPrevious pandemics have been characterized by waves of activity spread over months. Once the level of disease activity drops, a critical communications task will be to balance this information with the possibility of another wave. Pandemic waves can be separated by months and an immediate \"at-ease\" signal may be premature.\n\nIn the '''post-pandemic period''', influenza disease activity will have returned to levels normally seen for seasonal influenza. It is expected that the pandemic virus will behave as a seasonal influenza A virus. At this stage, it is important to maintain surveillance and update pandemic preparedness and response plans accordingly. An intensive phase of recovery and evaluation may be required.\n\n==Government preparations for a potential H5N1 pandemic (2003\u20132009)==\nAccording to ''[[The New York Times]]'' as of March 2006, \"governments worldwide have spent billions planning for a potential influenza pandemic: buying medicines, running disaster drills, [and] developing strategies for tighter border controls\" due to the [[Influenza A virus subtype H5N1|H5N1]] threat.<ref>{{cite news  | last = Rosenthal  | first = Elisabeth  |author2=Bradsher, Keith  | title = Is Business Ready for a Flu Pandemic?  |work=The New York Times   |date= 16 March 2006  | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/16/business/16bird.html?_r=1&oref=slogin  | accessdate = 13 September 2006 }}</ref>\n\n{{quote|[T]he United States is collaborating closely with eight international organizations, including the [[WHO|World Health Organization]] (WHO), the [[FAO|Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO), the [[OIE|World Organization for Animal Health]] (OIE), and 88 foreign governments to address the situation through planning, greater monitoring, and full transparency in reporting and investigating avian influenza occurrences.

In addition, epidemiological factors, such as the WWI practice of packing soldiers with severe influenza illness into field hospitals while soldiers with mild illness stayed outside on the battlefield, are an important determinant of whether or not a new strain of influenza virus will spur a pandemic.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Copeland|first=CS|date=Nov-Dec 2013|title=Deadliest Catch: Elusive, evolving flu difficult to predict|url=https://claudiacopeland.com/uploads/3/5/5/6/35560346/hjbr_deadliest_catch.pdf|journal=Healthcare Journal of Baton Rouge|volume=|pages=32\u201336|via=}}</ref> (During the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, this practice served to promote the evolution of more virulent viral strains over those that produced mild illness.)

So a flu from a virus similar to the  isolate A/Fujian/411/2002(H3N2) is called Fujian flu, human flu, and H3N2 flu.\n\n[[File:Influenza subtypes.svg|thumb|right|375px|The various types of [[influenza]] viruses in humans.

Each subtype virus has [[mutate]]d into a variety of strains with differing [[pathogenic]] profiles; some pathogenic to one species but not others, some pathogenic to multiple species. Most known strains are extinct strains. For example, the annual flu subtype H3N2 no longer contains the strain that caused the [[Hong Kong Flu]].<ref name=Harder>{{cite book |author1=Harder, T.

Longer-term strategies proposed for regions where highly pathogenic H5N1 is endemic in wild birds have included:\n* changing local farming practices to increase farm hygiene and reduce contact between livestock and wild birds.\n* altering farming practices in regions where animals live in close, often unsanitary quarters with people, and changing the practices of open-air \"[[wet markets]]\" where birds are kept for live sale and slaughtered on-site. A challenge to implementing these measures is widespread poverty, frequently in rural areas, coupled with a reliance upon raising fowl for purposes of [[subsistence farming]] or income without measures to prevent propagation of the disease.\n* changing local shopping practices from purchase of live fowl to purchase of slaughtered, pre-packaged fowl.\n* improving veterinary [[vaccine]] availability and cost.<ref name=\"The Threat of Global Pandemics\"/>\n\n==Strategies to slow down a flu pandemic==\n{{See also|Flu research}}\n\n===Public response measures===\nThe main ways available to tackle a flu pandemic initially are behavioural.

Once a potential virus is identified and a vaccine is approved, it normally takes five to six months before the vaccine becomes available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/notes/h1n1_vaccine_20090806/en/|title= Pandemic influenza vaccine manufacturing process and timeline|website=www.WHO.int|access-date=19 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe capability to produce vaccines varies widely from country to country; only 19 countries are listed as \"influenza vaccine manufacturers\" according to the World Health Organization.<ref>{{cite web|title=Influenza vaccine manufacturers |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/manulist/en/index.html |access-date=13 September 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822222456/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/manulist/en/index.html |archivedate=22 August 2006 }}</ref> It is estimated that, in a best scenario situation, 750&nbsp;million doses could be produced each year, whereas it is likely that each individual would need two doses of the vaccine to become immuno-competent.

Cost considerations aside, they fear that the countries with vaccine-manufacturing capability will reserve production to protect their own populations and not release vaccines to other countries until their own population is protected. Indonesia has refused to share samples of H5N1 strains which have infected and killed its citizens until it receives assurances that it will have access to vaccines produced with those samples.

The first problem is this: seasonal influenza vaccines require a single injection of 15 \u03bcg haemagluttinin in order to give protection; H5 seems to evoke only a weak immune response and a large multicentre trial found that two injections of 90&nbsp;\u00b5g H5 given 28 days apart provided protection in only 54% of people {{Harv|Treanor|2006}}. Even if it is considered that 54% is an acceptable level of protection, the world is currently capable of producing only 900&nbsp;million doses at a strength of 15 \u03bcg (assuming that all production were immediately converted to manufacturing H5 vaccine); if two injections of 90 \u03bcg are needed then this capacity drops to only 70&nbsp;million {{Harv|Poland|2006}}.  Trials using [[adjuvant]]s such as [[alum]], [[AS03]], [[AS04]] or [[MF59]] to try and lower the dose of vaccine are urgently needed.  The second problem is this: there are two circulating [[clade]]s of virus, clade 1 is the virus originally isolated in Vietnam, clade 2 is the virus isolated in Indonesia. Vaccine research has mostly been focused on clade 1 viruses, but the clade 2 virus is antigenically distinct and a clade 1 vaccine will probably not protect against a pandemic caused by clade 2 virus.\n\nSince 2009, most vaccine development efforts have been focused on the current pandemic influenza virus H1N1. As of July 2009, more than 70 known clinical trials have been completed or are ongoing for pandemic influenza vaccines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/immunogenicity/immunogenicity_table.xls|title=World Health Organization.

The grouping and description of pandemic phases have been revised to make them easier to understand, more precise, and based upon observable phenomena. Phases 1\u20133 correlate with preparedness, including capacity development and response planning activities, while phases 4\u20136 clearly signal the need for response and mitigation efforts. Furthermore, periods after the first pandemic wave are elaborated to facilitate post pandemic recovery activities.\n\nIn February 2020, WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic explained that the WHO no longer uses this six-phase classification model: \"For the sake of clarification, WHO does not use the old system of 6 phases \u2014 that ranged from phase 1 (no reports of animal influenza causing human infections) to phase 6 (a pandemic) \u2014 that some people may be familiar with from H1N1 in 2009.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-china-health-who-idUKKCN20I0PD|title=WHO says it no longer uses 'pandemic' category, but virus still emergency|date=2020-02-24|work=Reuters|access-date=2020-02-29|language=en}}</ref>\n\nFor reference, the phases are defined below.<ref>{{cite news| title=Current WHO phase of pandemic alert| url =http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/phase/en/|publisher=WHO}}</ref>\n\nIn nature, influenza viruses circulate continuously among animals, especially birds. Even though such viruses might theoretically develop into pandemic viruses, in '''Phase 1''' no viruses circulating among animals have been reported to cause infections in humans.\n\nIn '''Phase 2''' an animal influenza virus circulating among domesticated or wild animals is known to have caused infection in humans, and is therefore considered a potential pandemic threat.\n\nIn '''Phase 3''', an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus has caused sporadic cases or small clusters of disease in people, but has not resulted in human-to-human transmission sufficient to sustain community-level outbreaks. Limited human-to-human transmission may occur under some circumstances, for example, when there is close contact between an infected person and an unprotected caregiver. However, limited transmission under such restricted circumstances does not indicate that the virus has gained the level of transmissibility among humans necessary to cause a pandemic.\n\n'''Phase 4''' is characterized by verified human-to-human transmission of an animal or human-animal influenza reassortant virus able to cause \"community-level outbreaks\". The ability to cause sustained disease outbreaks in a community marks a significant upwards shift in the risk for a pandemic. Any country that suspects or has verified such an event should urgently consult with the WHO so that the situation can be jointly assessed and a decision made by the affected country if implementation of a rapid pandemic containment operation is warranted. Phase 4 indicates a significant increase in risk of a pandemic but does not necessarily mean that a pandemic is a foregone conclusion.\n\n'''Phase 5''' is characterized by human-to-human spread of the virus into at least two countries in one WHO region. While most countries will not be affected at this stage, the declaration of Phase 5 is a strong signal that a pandemic is imminent and that the time to finalize the organization, communication, and implementation of the planned mitigation measures is short.\n\n'''Phase 6''', the pandemic phase, is characterized by community level outbreaks in at least one other country in a different WHO region in addition to the criteria defined in Phase 5. Designation of this phase will indicate that a global pandemic is under way.\n\nDuring the '''post-peak period''', pandemic disease levels in most countries with adequate surveillance will have dropped below peak observed levels. The post-peak period signifies that pandemic activity appears to be decreasing; however, it is uncertain if additional waves will occur and countries will need to be prepared for a second wave.\n\nPrevious pandemics have been characterized by waves of activity spread over months. Once the level of disease activity drops, a critical communications task will be to balance this information with the possibility of another wave. Pandemic waves can be separated by months and an immediate \"at-ease\" signal may be premature.\n\nIn the '''post-pandemic period''', influenza disease activity will have returned to levels normally seen for seasonal influenza. It is expected that the pandemic virus will behave as a seasonal influenza A virus. At this stage, it is important to maintain surveillance and update pandemic preparedness and response plans accordingly. An intensive phase of recovery and evaluation may be required.\n\n==Government preparations for a potential H5N1 pandemic (2003\u20132009)==\nAccording to ''[[The New York Times]]'' as of March 2006, \"governments worldwide have spent billions planning for a potential influenza pandemic: buying medicines, running disaster drills, [and] developing strategies for tighter border controls\" due to the [[Influenza A virus subtype H5N1|H5N1]] threat.<ref>{{cite news  | last = Rosenthal  | first = Elisabeth  |author2=Bradsher, Keith  | title = Is Business Ready for a Flu Pandemic?  |work=The New York Times   |date= 16 March 2006  | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/16/business/16bird.html?_r=1&oref=slogin  | accessdate = 13 September 2006 }}</ref>\n\n{{quote|[T]he United States is collaborating closely with eight international organizations, including the [[WHO|World Health Organization]] (WHO), the [[FAO|Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO), the [[OIE|World Organization for Animal Health]] (OIE), and 88 foreign governments to address the situation through planning, greater monitoring, and full transparency in reporting and investigating avian influenza occurrences.

Clare Gregorian was described as the \"driving force\" behind the idea.<ref>http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180429/clare-gregorian-driving-force-behind-ripr-dies-at-80</ref> At the time, Rhode Island was the only state in [[New England]] (traditionally one of the bedrocks of support for NPR) and one of only two in the entire country (the other being [[Delaware]]) that did not have a full-service NPR station within its borders. Most of the state got at least a grade B signal from Boston's [[WGBH (FM)|WGBH]] (with Providence itself receiving a city-grade signal) and [[WBUR]].  After a few years of looking, they found a partner in [[Boston University]], owner of WBUR.  BU agreed to buy [[WRPA (AM)|WRCP]] (1290 [[AM broadcasting|AM]]), a 5,000-watt station that had been on the air since [[1947 in radio|1947]], for $1.9 million; the foundation conducted a statewide drive to help raise the funds.  For many years, 1290 AM had been known as WICE, but switched to [[Portugal|Portuguese]] programming as WRCP in [[1983 in radio|1983]].\n\nOn May 1, 1998, WRCP's calls officially changed to WRNI, and the license was officially transferred to the '''WRNI Foundation,''' a separate fundraising group set up by WBUR to handle local underwriting.\n\nEven though BU doubled WRNI's transmission power to 10,000 watts, its signal was not strong enough to reach the southern and western portion of the state (though it provides a city-grade signal to [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], southern Rhode Island's biggest city).  Accordingly, in 1999, BU bought WERI (1230 AM) in Westerly, which had been on the air since [[1949 in radio|1949]].  BU changed WERI's calls to WXNI, and made it a full-time satellite of WRNI.  The station brought a city-grade NPR signal to southern Rhode Island for the first time ever.\n\nBU and WBUR had very big plans for WRNI at first. It moved WRNI from its longtime studio on Douglas Avenue to a state-of-the-art facility at Union Station.  It also started a daily two-hour local news magazine, ''One Union Station.''  <ref name=\"Fybush\">[http://www.fybush.com/NERW/2004/040920/nerw.html NorthEast Radio Watch by Scott Fybush<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  It also had plans to set up a third station to fill the gaps in WXNI's 1,000-watt signal.<ref name=\"Current\">[http://www.current.org/radio/radio0418rhodeisland.shtml Current.org | Struggle over WBUR's Rhode Island stations, 2004<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, budget problems brought on by the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] forced ''One Union Station's'' cancellation. It was replaced with a one-hour news magazine that was canceled in 2004. At that point, WRNI's local operations were significantly cut back, with most of the station's staff either laid off or transferred to Boston. As a result, WRNI's schedule became almost identical to that of WBUR.\n\n===Controversy over sale of 1290AM===\nOn September 17, 2004, with no advance warning, WBUR Group general manager Jane Christo announced that WRNI and WXNI were being put on the market. She wouldn't give any specifics, only saying that it was time for Rhode Islanders to buy the stations if they wanted to keep NPR programming in the state.<ref name=\"Fybush\"/>  Indeed, WBUR claimed that it never intended to operate WRNI on a long-term basis, and had only intended to help develop it into a self-sustaining service.<ref name=\"Current\"/>\n\nThe reaction in Rhode Island was, not surprisingly, hostile. In an editorial, ''[[The Providence Journal]]'' said that WBUR had made numerous long-term commitments to WRNI. The ''Journal'' claimed that if the station's local backers had to buy WRNI, it would be tantamount to buying the station twice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.projo.com/opinion/editorials/content/projo_20040919_19edwr.10caf3.html|title=Editorial: Broadcast betrayal |work=Providence Journal|date=September 19, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080301105211/http://www.projo.com/opinion/editorials/content/projo_20040919_19edwr.10caf3.html|archivedate=March 1, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe announcement led state attorney general [[Patrick C.

As a result, Lynch closed his investigation in November 2006.<ref name=\"LynchGlobe\"/>\n\n===Independence from Boston University===\nOn March 21, 2007, WBUR announced that it was selling WRNI to Rhode Island Public Radio (formerly the Foundation for Ocean State Public Radio) for $2 million. Rhode Island Public Radio also announced it was buying WAKX (102.7 [[FM broadcasting|FM]]) in [[Narragansett Pier, Rhode Island|Narragansett Pier]] from [[Davidson Media Group]] to serve as a repeater for WRNI in southern Rhode Island.<ref>{{cite news|author=Smith, Andy| url=http://green.tmcnet.com/news/2007/03/23/2439642.htm| title=R.I. group to buy WRNI|date=March 23, 2007|work=Providence Journal}}</ref> WAKX, which signed on in 1989, had been a [[smooth jazz]] station (though its call letters referred to a former simulcast of [[WWKX]], which lasted from 1997 to 2005).  As part of the sale agreement, BU will continue to provide engineering and programming assistance to RIPR for five years.\n\nRIPR officially took control of WAKX on May 17, 2007; changing the calls to WRNI-FM. The addition of WRNI-FM made WXNI redundant, and BU has sold that station separately to Diponti Communications, which renamed it [[WBLQ (AM)|WBLQ]].  RIPR took control of WRNI on September 1, 2008.\n\nRIPR registered the domain name ''ripr.org'' on February 13, 2007; the site was live as of June 2007.\n\n===Migration to FM===\n[[File:WNPN Air Studio.jpg|thumb|right|The Public's Radio Studio A, where local newscasts originate daily.]]\nRecognizing the long-term challenges of AM broadcasting,<ref>[http://www.radioworld.com/news-and-business/0002/is-am-radio-still-relevant/322673 \"Is AM Radio Still Relevant?\" Radio World, August 30, 2009]</ref> and the general expectation by public radio listeners that public radio stations transmit on the noncommercial end of the FM band (88.1-91.9&nbsp;MHz), in 2011 WRNI began to expand into a statewide network of FM signals.  Accordingly, it also began branding itself exclusively as \"Rhode Island Public Radio.\"\n\n'''91.5FM''' First, in July 2011, RIPR entered an agreement with [[WCVY]] (91.5 FM), which is owned & operated by [[Coventry High School (Coventry, Rhode Island)|Coventry High School]] and covers the Kent County region. Previously, because WCVY did not broadcast 24/7, they had been forced, under [https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/47/73.561 FCC rule 73.561(b)], to \"share-time\" 16 hours per day of the frequency with the now-defunct [[Religious broadcasting|religious]] station [[WRJI]]. After WRJI lost its license, RIPR assisted WCVY in \"reclaiming\" the frequency for 24/7 operation.  WCVY still airs its own student-created programming on weekdays from 2-8p.m. when school is in session, and RIPR fills the remainder of the time to avoid another \"share-time\" challenge.<ref name=nerw-wcvyripr>{{cite news|last=Fybush|first=Scott|authorlink=|title=Merlin Drops 101.9 Clues|url=http://www.fybush.com/NERW/2011/110711/nerw.html|accessdate=October 10, 2011|newspaper=NorthEast Radio Watch|date=July 11, 2011}}</ref>\n\n'''88.1FM''' Then, on October 8, 2011, RIPR signed a 10-year lease with [[The Wheeler School]], a K-12 private day school and owner of [[WELH]] (88.1 FM).<ref>[http://www.radiosurvivor.com/2011/08/22/the-wheeler-school-to-lease-fm-airwaves-to-rhode-island-public-radio/ \"The Wheeler School to Lease FM Airwaves to Rhode Island Public Radio\"] Jennifer Waits, ''Radio Survivor'', August 22, 2011</ref> RIPR's content would be heard 24/7 on 88.1 in Providence except for a student-produced sports talk radio midnight-3 Saturday mornings.

Clare Gregorian was described as the \"driving force\" behind the idea.<ref>http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20180429/clare-gregorian-driving-force-behind-ripr-dies-at-80</ref> At the time, Rhode Island was the only state in [[New England]] (traditionally one of the bedrocks of support for NPR) and one of only two in the entire country (the other being [[Delaware]]) that did not have a full-service NPR station within its borders. Most of the state got at least a grade B signal from Boston's [[WGBH (FM)|WGBH]] (with Providence itself receiving a city-grade signal) and [[WBUR]].  After a few years of looking, they found a partner in [[Boston University]], owner of WBUR.  BU agreed to buy [[WRPA (AM)|WRCP]] (1290 [[AM broadcasting|AM]]), a 5,000-watt station that had been on the air since [[1947 in radio|1947]], for $1.9 million; the foundation conducted a statewide drive to help raise the funds.  For many years, 1290 AM had been known as WICE, but switched to [[Portugal|Portuguese]] programming as WRCP in [[1983 in radio|1983]].\n\nOn May 1, 1998, WRCP's calls officially changed to WRNI, and the license was officially transferred to the '''WRNI Foundation,''' a separate fundraising group set up by WBUR to handle local underwriting.\n\nEven though BU doubled WRNI's transmission power to 10,000 watts, its signal was not strong enough to reach the southern and western portion of the state (though it provides a city-grade signal to [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], southern Rhode Island's biggest city).  Accordingly, in 1999, BU bought WERI (1230 AM) in Westerly, which had been on the air since [[1949 in radio|1949]].  BU changed WERI's calls to WXNI, and made it a full-time satellite of WRNI.  The station brought a city-grade NPR signal to southern Rhode Island for the first time ever.\n\nBU and WBUR had very big plans for WRNI at first. It moved WRNI from its longtime studio on Douglas Avenue to a state-of-the-art facility at Union Station.  It also started a daily two-hour local news magazine, ''One Union Station.''  <ref name=\"Fybush\">[http://www.fybush.com/NERW/2004/040920/nerw.html NorthEast Radio Watch by Scott Fybush<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  It also had plans to set up a third station to fill the gaps in WXNI's 1,000-watt signal.<ref name=\"Current\">[http://www.current.org/radio/radio0418rhodeisland.shtml Current.org | Struggle over WBUR's Rhode Island stations, 2004<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, budget problems brought on by the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] forced ''One Union Station's'' cancellation. It was replaced with a one-hour news magazine that was canceled in 2004. At that point, WRNI's local operations were significantly cut back, with most of the station's staff either laid off or transferred to Boston. As a result, WRNI's schedule became almost identical to that of WBUR.\n\n===Controversy over sale of 1290AM===\nOn September 17, 2004, with no advance warning, WBUR Group general manager Jane Christo announced that WRNI and WXNI were being put on the market. She wouldn't give any specifics, only saying that it was time for Rhode Islanders to buy the stations if they wanted to keep NPR programming in the state.<ref name=\"Fybush\"/>  Indeed, WBUR claimed that it never intended to operate WRNI on a long-term basis, and had only intended to help develop it into a self-sustaining service.<ref name=\"Current\"/>\n\nThe reaction in Rhode Island was, not surprisingly, hostile. In an editorial, ''[[The Providence Journal]]'' said that WBUR had made numerous long-term commitments to WRNI. The ''Journal'' claimed that if the station's local backers had to buy WRNI, it would be tantamount to buying the station twice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.projo.com/opinion/editorials/content/projo_20040919_19edwr.10caf3.html|title=Editorial: Broadcast betrayal |work=Providence Journal|date=September 19, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080301105211/http://www.projo.com/opinion/editorials/content/projo_20040919_19edwr.10caf3.html|archivedate=March 1, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe announcement led state attorney general [[Patrick C.

It promised to hire a full-time general manager based in Providence, and also stepped up local news coverage.  As a result, Lynch closed his investigation in November 2006.<ref name=\"LynchGlobe\"/>\n\n===Independence from Boston University===\nOn March 21, 2007, WBUR announced that it was selling WRNI to Rhode Island Public Radio (formerly the Foundation for Ocean State Public Radio) for $2 million. Rhode Island Public Radio also announced it was buying WAKX (102.7 [[FM broadcasting|FM]]) in [[Narragansett Pier, Rhode Island|Narragansett Pier]] from [[Davidson Media Group]] to serve as a repeater for WRNI in southern Rhode Island.<ref>{{cite news|author=Smith, Andy| url=http://green.tmcnet.com/news/2007/03/23/2439642.htm| title=R.I. group to buy WRNI|date=March 23, 2007|work=Providence Journal}}</ref> WAKX, which signed on in 1989, had been a [[smooth jazz]] station (though its call letters referred to a former simulcast of [[WWKX]], which lasted from 1997 to 2005).  As part of the sale agreement, BU will continue to provide engineering and programming assistance to RIPR for five years.\n\nRIPR officially took control of WAKX on May 17, 2007; changing the calls to WRNI-FM. The addition of WRNI-FM made WXNI redundant, and BU has sold that station separately to Diponti Communications, which renamed it [[WBLQ (AM)|WBLQ]].  RIPR took control of WRNI on September 1, 2008.\n\nRIPR registered the domain name ''ripr.org'' on February 13, 2007; the site was live as of June 2007.\n\n===Migration to FM===\n[[File:WNPN Air Studio.jpg|thumb|right|The Public's Radio Studio A, where local newscasts originate daily.]]\nRecognizing the long-term challenges of AM broadcasting,<ref>[http://www.radioworld.com/news-and-business/0002/is-am-radio-still-relevant/322673 \"Is AM Radio Still Relevant?\" Radio World, August 30, 2009]</ref> and the general expectation by public radio listeners that public radio stations transmit on the noncommercial end of the FM band (88.1-91.9&nbsp;MHz), in 2011 WRNI began to expand into a statewide network of FM signals.  Accordingly, it also began branding itself exclusively as \"Rhode Island Public Radio.\"\n\n'''91.5FM''' First, in July 2011, RIPR entered an agreement with [[WCVY]] (91.5 FM), which is owned & operated by [[Coventry High School (Coventry, Rhode Island)|Coventry High School]] and covers the Kent County region. Previously, because WCVY did not broadcast 24/7, they had been forced, under [https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/47/73.561 FCC rule 73.561(b)], to \"share-time\" 16 hours per day of the frequency with the now-defunct [[Religious broadcasting|religious]] station [[WRJI]]. After WRJI lost its license, RIPR assisted WCVY in \"reclaiming\" the frequency for 24/7 operation.  WCVY still airs its own student-created programming on weekdays from 2-8p.m. when school is in session, and RIPR fills the remainder of the time to avoid another \"share-time\" challenge.<ref name=nerw-wcvyripr>{{cite news|last=Fybush|first=Scott|authorlink=|title=Merlin Drops 101.9 Clues|url=http://www.fybush.com/NERW/2011/110711/nerw.html|accessdate=October 10, 2011|newspaper=NorthEast Radio Watch|date=July 11, 2011}}</ref>\n\n'''88.1FM''' Then, on October 8, 2011, RIPR signed a 10-year lease with [[The Wheeler School]], a K-12 private day school and owner of [[WELH]] (88.1 FM).<ref>[http://www.radiosurvivor.com/2011/08/22/the-wheeler-school-to-lease-fm-airwaves-to-rhode-island-public-radio/ \"The Wheeler School to Lease FM Airwaves to Rhode Island Public Radio\"] Jennifer Waits, ''Radio Survivor'', August 22, 2011</ref> RIPR's content would be heard 24/7 on 88.1 in Providence except for a student-produced sports talk radio midnight-3 Saturday mornings.
