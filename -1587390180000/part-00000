{"title_page": "Yield to maturity", "text_new": "{{Financial markets}}\nThe '''yield to maturity''' ('''YTM'''), '''book yield''' or '''redemption yield''' of a [[Bond (finance)|bond]] or other [[security (finance)|fixed-interest security]], such as [[Gilt-edged securities|gilts]], is the (theoretical) [[internal rate of return]] (IRR, overall interest rate) earned by an investor who buys the bond today at the market price, assuming that the bond is held until [[Maturity (finance)|maturity]], and that all [[Coupon (bond)|coupon]] and principal payments are made on schedule.<ref>[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yieldtomaturity.asp Definition of 'Yield To Maturity (YTM)']</ref> Yield to maturity is the discount rate at which the sum of all future cash flows from the bond (coupons and principal) is equal to the current price of the bond. The YTM is often given in terms of Annual Percentage Rate (A.P.R.), but more often market convention is followed. In a number of major markets (such as gilts) the convention is to quote annualized yields with semi-annual compounding (see [[compound interest]]);  thus, for example, an annual effective yield of 10.25% would be quoted as 10.00%, because 1.05 \u00d7 1.05 = 1.1025 and 2 \u00d7 5 = 10.<ref>[http://www.dmo.gov.uk/documentview.aspx?docname=/giltsmarket/formulae/yldeqns_v2.pdf&page=Gilts/Formulae Formulae for Calculating Gilt Prices from Yields]</ref>\n\n==Main assumptions==\nThe main underlying assumptions used concerning the traditional yield measures are:\n* The bond is held to maturity.\n* All coupon and principal payments are made on schedule.\n* The yield to maturity is the single interest rate that equates the present value of a bond's cash flows to its price.<ref>Fabozzi, Frank. ''The Handbook of Fixed Income Securities''. McGraw-Hill, 2012, p. 746.</ref> The coupons received must be reinvested into an investment that earns the same rate as the yield to maturity.The risk that the yield to maturity will not be achieved due to not being able to reinvest the coupons at the YTM rate is known as reinvestment risk. Reinvestment risk is proportional to the time to maturity of the debt instrument as well as the size of the interim coupons received.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Handbook of Fixed Income Securities|last=Fabozzi|first=Frank|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=103, 104, 105}}</ref> Some literature however, such as the paper ''Yield-to-Maturity and the Reinvestment of Coupon Payments'' claims that making the reinvestment assumption is a common mistake in financial literature and coupon reinvestment is not required for YTM formula to hold. \n* The yield is usually quoted without making any allowance for tax paid by the investor on the return, and is then known as \"gross redemption yield\". It also does not make any allowance for the dealing costs incurred by the purchaser (or seller).\n\n==Coupon rate vs. YTM and parity==\n* If a bond's [[coupon rate]] is less than its YTM, then the bond is selling at a discount.\n* If a bond's coupon rate is more than its YTM, then the bond is selling at a premium.\n* If a bond's coupon rate is equal to its YTM, then the bond is selling at [[par value|par]].\n\n==Variants of yield to maturity==\n\nAs some bonds have different characteristics, there are some variants of YTM:\n* Yield to call (YTC): when a bond is callable (can be repurchased by the issuer before the maturity), the market looks also to the Yield to call, which is the same calculation of the YTM, but assumes that the bond will be called, so the cashflow is shortened.\n* Yield to put (YTP): same as yield to call, but when the bond holder has the option to sell the bond back to the issuer at a fixed price on specified date.\n* Yield to worst (YTW): when a bond is callable, puttable, exchangeable, or has other features, the yield to worst is the lowest yield of yield to maturity, yield to call, yield to put, and others.\n\n==Consequences==\nWhen the YTM is less than the (expected) yield of another investment, one might be tempted to swap the investments. Care should be taken to subtract any transaction costs, or taxes.\n\n==Calculations==\n===Formula for yield to maturity for zero-coupon bonds===\n\n<math>\n\\text{Yield to maturity(YTM)} = \\sqrt[\\text{Time period}]{\\dfrac{\\text{Face value}}{\\text{Present value}}} - 1\n</math>\n\n====Example 1====\nConsider a 30-year [[zero-coupon bond]] with a face value of $100. If the bond is priced at an annual YTM of 10%, it will cost $5.73 today (the [[present value]] of this cash flow, 100/(1.1)<sup>30</sup> = 5.73). Over the coming 30 years, the price will advance to $100, and the annualized return will be 10%.\n\nWhat happens in the meantime? Suppose that over the first 10 years of the holding period, [[interest rates]] decline, and the yield-to-maturity on the bond falls to 7%. With 20 years remaining to maturity, the price of the bond will be 100/1.07<sup>20</sup>, or $25.84. Even though the yield-to-maturity for the remaining life of the bond is just 7%, and the yield-to-maturity bargained for when the bond was purchased was only 10%, the return earned over the first 10 years is 16.25%. This can be found by evaluating (1+i) from the equation (1+i)<sup>10</sup> = (25.882/5.7389), giving 0.1625.\n\nOver the remaining 20 years of the bond, the annual rate earned is not 16.25%, but rather 7%. This can be found by evaluating (1+i) from the equation (1+i)<sup>20</sup> = 100/25.84, giving 1.07. Over the entire 30 year holding period, the original $5.73 invested increased to $100, so 10% per annum was earned, irrespective of any interest rate changes in between.\n\n====Example 2====\n\nAn ABCXYZ Company bond that matures in one year, has a 5% yearly interest rate (coupon), and has a par value of $100. To sell to a new investor the bond must be priced for a current yield of 5.56%.\n\nThe annual bond coupon should increase from $5 to $5.56 but the coupon can't change as only the bond price can change. So the bond is priced approximately at $100 - $0.56 or $99.44 .\n\nIf the bond is held until maturity, the bond will pay $5 as interest and $100 par value for the matured bond. For the $99.44 investment, the bond investor will receive $105 and therefore the yield to maturity is 5.56 / 99.44 for 5.59% in the one year time period. Then continuing by trial and error, a bond gain of 5.53 divided by a bond price of 99.47 produces a yield to maturity of 5.56%. Also, the bond gain and the bond price add up to 105.\n\nFinally, a one-year zero-coupon bond of $105 and with a yield to maturity of 5.56%, calculates at a price of 105 / 1.0556^1 or 99.47.\n\n===Coupon-bearing Bonds===\n\nFor bonds with multiple coupons, it is not generally possible to solve for yield in terms of price algebraically. A numerical root-finding technique such as [[Newton's method]] must be used to approximate the yield, which renders the present value of future cash flows equal to the bond price.\n\n===Varying coupon===\n\nWith varying coupons the general [[discounting]] rule should be applied.\n\n==Subscriber Yield==\n\nA term used in Japan, this is simply the Yield to Maturity at time of issue: in other words the Yield to Maturity enjoyed by the buyer (subscriber) in the primary market.<ref>\n{{Cite book|title=Sales Representatives Manual 2018 Vol.2|publisher=Japan Securities Dealers Association|year=2018|pages=235}}\n</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bond valuation#Present value approach]]\n*[[Dividend yield]]\n*[[Bond duration]]\n*[[Coupon rate]]\n*[[Compound interest]]\n*[[I-spread]]\n*[[Asset swap spread]]\n*[[Option-adjusted spread]]\n*[[Z-spread]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{Citation\n  | last = Mayle\n  | first = Jan\n  | title =Standard Securities Calculation Methods: Fixed Income Securities Formulas for Price, Yield and Accrued Interest\n  | publisher =[[Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association]]\n  | year =1993\n  | volume = 1\n  | edition = 3rd\n  | isbn = 1-882936-01-9}}.

He is one of few top Hollywood actors to have also become a critically and commercially successful director.

Clark Gable, Gary Cooper, Spencer Tracy, James Stewart, Cary Grant, Humphrey Bogart, William Holden, Steve McQueen, and Sean Connery never directed a feature. John Wayne directed only twice, and badly; ditto Burt Lancaster. Paul Newman, Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty, Robert Redford, Robert De Niro, and Sean Penn have directed a few movies each, with mixed commercial and artistic success.}}\n\nFrom the very early days of his career Eastwood was frustrated by directors' insistence that scenes be re-shot multiple times and perfected, and when he began directing in 1970, he made a conscious attempt to avoid any aspects of directing he had been indifferent to as an actor. As a result, Eastwood is renowned for his efficient film directing and ability to reduce filming time and control budgets. He usually avoids actors' rehearsing and prefers to complete most scenes on the first take.<ref>Munn, p. 160</ref><ref name=\"Biskind19697\">Kapsis and Coblentz, pp. 196\u201397 (interviewer Peter Biskind)</ref> Eastwood's rapid filmmaking practices have been compared to those of [[Woody Allen]], [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], and the [[Coen brothers]]. When acting in others' films he sometimes takes over directing, such as for ''The Outlaw Josey Wales'', if he believes production is too slow.{{r|denby20100308}} In preparation for filming Eastwood rarely uses [[storyboard]]s for developing the layout of a shooting schedule.<ref name=\"Gentry65\">Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 65 (interviewer Ric Gentry)</ref><ref name=\"Abb173\">Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 173 (interviewer Denise Abbott)</ref><ref name=\"Pascal235\">Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 235 (interviewer [[Pascal M\u00e9rigeau]])</ref> He also attempts to reduce script background details on characters to allow the audience to become more involved in the film,<ref name=\"Intp678\">Kapsis and Coblentz, pp. 67\u201368 (interviewer Ric Gentry)</ref> considering their imagination a requirement for a film that connects with viewers.<ref name=\"Intp678\" /><ref name=\"Intp91\">Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 91 (interviewer David Thomson)</ref> Eastwood has indicated that he lays out a film's plot to provide the audience with necessary details, but not \"so much that it insults their intelligence.\"<ref name=\"Intp60\">Kapsis and Coblentz, p. 60 (interviewer Ric Gentry)</ref>\n\nAccording to ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, \"Eastwood's style is to shoot first and act afterward.

As a young man making a name for himself during the production of ''Rawhide'', Eastwood would be featured in magazines and journals, which often documented his health-conscious lifestyle. In the August 1959 edition of ''TV Guide'', for example, Eastwood was photographed doing push-ups. He gave tips on fitness and nutrition, telling people to eat plenty of fruit and raw vegetables, to take vitamins, and to avoid sugar-loaded beverages, excessive alcohol, and overloading on carbohydrates.<ref name=\"McGilligan, p. 108\" />\n\nOn July 21, 1970, Eastwood's father died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the age of 64.<ref name=\"McGilligan192\" /> The death, described by Fritz Manes as \"the only bad thing that ever happened to him in his life\", came as a shock to Eastwood, since his grandfather had lived to be 92.

These roles, among others, have made Eastwood an enduring [[cultural icon]] of [[masculinity]].<ref name=\"Fischer, Landy & Smith\">Fischer, Landy & Smith, p. 43.</ref><ref>Kitses, p. 307.</ref>\n\nFor his work in the Western film ''[[Unforgiven]]'' (1992) and the sports drama ''[[Million Dollar Baby]]'' (2004), Eastwood won Academy Awards for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], as well as receiving nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]].

[[Lee Van Cleef]] returned as a ruthless fortune seeker, with [[Eli Wallach]] portraying the Mexican bandit Tuco Ramirez. The storyline involved the search for a cache of [[Confederate gold]] buried in a cemetery.

He is one of few top Hollywood actors to have also become a critically and commercially successful director.

Clark Gable, Gary Cooper, Spencer Tracy, James Stewart, Cary Grant, Humphrey Bogart, William Holden, Steve McQueen, and Sean Connery never directed a feature. John Wayne directed only twice, and badly; ditto Burt Lancaster. Paul Newman, Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty, Robert Redford, Robert De Niro, and Sean Penn have directed a few movies each, with mixed commercial and artistic success.}}\n\nFrom the very early days of his career Eastwood was frustrated by directors' insistence that scenes be re-shot multiple times and perfected, and when he began directing in 1970, he made a conscious attempt to avoid any aspects of directing he had been indifferent to as an actor. As a result, Eastwood is renowned for his efficient film directing and ability to reduce filming time and control budgets. He usually avoids actors' rehearsing and prefers to complete most scenes on the first take.<ref>Munn, p. 160</ref><ref name=\"Biskind19697\">Kapsis and Coblentz, pp. 196\u201397 (interviewer Peter Biskind)</ref> Eastwood's rapid filmmaking practices have been compared to those of [[Woody Allen]], [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]], and the [[Coen brothers]].

As a young man making a name for himself during the production of ''Rawhide'', Eastwood would be featured in magazines and journals, which often documented his health-conscious lifestyle. In the August 1959 edition of ''TV Guide'', for example, Eastwood was photographed doing push-ups. He gave tips on fitness and nutrition, telling people to eat plenty of fruit and raw vegetables, to take vitamins, and to avoid sugar-loaded beverages, excessive alcohol, and overloading on carbohydrates.<ref name=\"McGilligan, p. 108\" />\n\nOn July 21, 1970, Eastwood's father died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the age of 64.<ref name=\"McGilligan192\" /> The death, described by Fritz Manes as \"the only bad thing that ever happened to him in his life\", came as a shock to Eastwood, since his grandfather had lived to be 92.

The alliance was made up of [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh]], [[Indian National Congress (Organisation)|Congress (O)]], The Socialist parties, and [[Charan Singh]]'s [[Bharatiya Kranti Dal]] representing northern peasant and farmers. Janata alliance, with [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between \"democracy and dictatorship.\" The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Indira supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, CFD ([[Congress for Democracy]]), primarily due to intra-party politicking and also due to circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that Sanjay had intentions of dislodging Gandhi and the trio stood between that. Gandhi's Congress party was crushed soundly in the elections. The public realized the statement and motto of the Janata Party alliance. Indira and [[Sanjay Gandhi]] both lost their seats, and Congress was cut down to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South. The Janata alliance, under the leadership of [[Morarji Desai]], came into power after the State of Emergency was lifted. The alliance parties later merged to form the [[Janata Party]] under the guidance of Gandhian leader, [[Jayaprakash Narayan]].

Her arrest and long-running trial gained her great sympathy from many people. The Janata coalition was only united by its hatred of Gandhi (or \"that woman\" as some called her). The party included right wing Hindu Nationalists, Socialists and former Congress party members. With so little in common, the Morarji Desai government was bogged down by infighting. In 1979, the government started to unravel over the issue of dual loyalties of some members to Janata and the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|RSS]]. The ambitious Union Finance minister, [[Charan Singh]], who as the Union Home Minister during the previous year had ordered arrest of Gandhi, took advantage of this and started courting the Congress. After a significant exodus from the party to Charan Singh's faction, Desai resigned in July 1979.

The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and casting of veto at United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Prior to the war Indira signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. The Soviets were not happy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Indira was not happy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept from criticizing the Soviet Union harshly.

The alliance was made up of [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh]], [[Indian National Congress (Organisation)|Congress (O)]], The Socialist parties, and [[Charan Singh]]'s [[Bharatiya Kranti Dal]] representing northern peasant and farmers. Janata alliance, with [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between \"democracy and dictatorship.\" The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Indira supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, CFD ([[Congress for Democracy]]), primarily due to intra-party politicking and also due to circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that Sanjay had intentions of dislodging Gandhi and the trio stood between that. Gandhi's Congress party was crushed soundly in the elections. The public realized the statement and motto of the Janata Party alliance. Indira and [[Sanjay Gandhi]] both lost their seats, and Congress was cut down to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South. The Janata alliance, under the leadership of [[Morarji Desai]], came into power after the State of Emergency was lifted. The alliance parties later merged to form the [[Janata Party]] under the guidance of Gandhian leader, [[Jayaprakash Narayan]].

Her arrest and long-running trial gained her great sympathy from many people. The Janata coalition was only united by its hatred of Gandhi (or \"that woman\" as some called her). The party included right wing Hindu Nationalists, Socialists and former Congress party members. With so little in common, the Morarji Desai government was bogged down by infighting. In 1979, the government started to unravel over the issue of dual loyalties of some members to Janata and the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|RSS]]. The ambitious Union Finance minister, [[Charan Singh]], who as the Union Home Minister during the previous year had ordered arrest of Gandhi, took advantage of this and started courting the Congress. After a significant exodus from the party to Charan Singh's faction, Desai resigned in July 1979.

The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and casting of veto at United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Prior to the war Indira signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. The Soviets were not happy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Indira was not happy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept from criticizing the Soviet Union harshly.

This positions SMCS to effectively engage the emerging nature of the non-deterministic complex challenges that are typical of rapidly evolving [[post-industrial society]]. \n\n== Technical Activities ==\nIEEE SMCS\u2019s three technical areas (TA) promote initiatives in support of the FoI:\n\n* Systems Science and Engineering\u2014Focuses on systematics formulation, interpretation, analysis and modelling of issues and decision-making opportunities for large and complex systems.\n\n* Human-Machine Systems\u2014Focuses on organizational interactions, cognitive ergonomics, and human information processing.\n\n* Cybernetics\u2014Focuses on communication and control across machines or among machine, human and organizations. This touches a very broad area including, but not limited to, computational intelligence, computer vision, neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, fuzzy systems and machine learning.\n\nTechnical committees (TCs) in each of the technical areas offer Society members the opportunity to collaborate with colleagues on topics of mutual interest. The committees evolve in response to societal needs, member interests, and new technology opportunities. Technical committees typically bring members together from government, academia and industry from around the globe.

The Group would later change its name to IEEE Professional Technical Group on Human Factors in Electronics (1963), IEEE Human Factors in Electronics Group (1964), Man-Machine Systems Group (1968), Systems, Man and Cybernetics Group (1970), and finally Systems, Man and Cybernetics Society (1972).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/IEEE_Systems,_Man,_and_Cybernetics_Society_History |title=IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society History |author=IEEE Global History Network |date=2011 |publisher=IEEE History Center |accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref>\n[[File:Ieee smc TC area.png|alt=3 areas of IEEE SMC technical activities|thumb|3 areas of IEEE SMC technical activities]]\nIEEE SMCS has fostered many different technical committees which has made it a sort of technical committee \u201cincubator.\u201d These technical committees have addressed a number of diverse topics including, but not limited to, electrotechnology, environmental quality, national priorities, health care, decision science, optimization, learning systems, pattern recognition, and biocybernetics. A number of IEEE SMCS technical interest groups eventually became separate IEEE entities in their own right. For example, robotics and automation special interest groups merged to become the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society, and the neural network special interest group became the IEEE Neural Networks Council<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Palmer|first=J.D.|date=September 2018|title=The IEEE Systems.

This positions SMCS to effectively engage the emerging nature of the non-deterministic complex challenges that are typical of rapidly evolving [[post-industrial society]]. \n\n== Technical Activities ==\nIEEE SMCS\u2019s three technical areas (TA) promote initiatives in support of the FoI:\n\n* Systems Science and Engineering\u2014Focuses on systematics formulation, interpretation, analysis and modelling of issues and decision-making opportunities for large and complex systems.\n\n* Human-Machine Systems\u2014Focuses on organizational interactions, cognitive ergonomics, and human information processing.\n\n* Cybernetics\u2014Focuses on communication and control across machines or among machine, human and organizations. This touches a very broad area including, but not limited to, computational intelligence, computer vision, neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, fuzzy systems and machine learning.\n\nTechnical committees (TCs) in each of the technical areas offer Society members the opportunity to collaborate with colleagues on topics of mutual interest. The committees evolve in response to societal needs, member interests, and new technology opportunities. Technical committees typically bring members together from government, academia and industry from around the globe.

Furthermore, most modern scholars do not consider Dionysius' calculations authoritative, placing the event several years earlier (see [[Chronology of Jesus]]).{{Events by year for decade|0}}\n\n==Significant people==\n* [[Erato of Armenia|Erato]], [[Artaxiad Dynasty]] Queen of Armenia, 8\u20135 BC, 2 BC \u2013 2 AD, 6\u201311\n* [[Ariobarzan of Atropatene]], Client King of Armenia, r. 1 BC \u2013 2 AD\n* [[Artavazd V]], Client King of Armenia, r. 2\u201311\n* [[Tigranes V of Armenia|Tigranes V]], [[Artaxiad Dynasty]] King of Armenia, r. 2\u20136\n* [[Emperor Ping|Ping Di]], Emperor of [[Han Dynasty]] China, r. 1 BC \u2013 5 AD\n* [[Ruzi Ying]], Emperor of [[Han Dynasty]] China, r. 6\u20139\n* [[Wang Mang]], Usurper Emperor of the short-lived [[Xin Dynasty]] in China r. 9\u201323\n* [[Antiochus III of Commagene|Antiochus III]], King of Commagene, r. 12 BC \u2013 17 AD\n* [[Arminius]], [[Germany|German]] war chief\n* [[Arshak II of Iberia|Arshak II]], King of [[Caucasian Iberia]], r. 20 BC-1 AD\n* [[Pharasmanes I of Iberia|Pharasmanes I]], King of [[Caucasian Iberia]], r. 1-58\n* [[Strato II and III|Strato II and Strato III]], co-kings of the Indo-Greek Kingdom, r. 25 BC \u2013 10 AD\n* [[Crimthann Nia N\u00e1ir]], Legendary [[List of High Kings of Ireland|High King of Ireland]], r.
