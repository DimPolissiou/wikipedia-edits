Clockwise from top: Ainz, Demiurge, Sebas, Albedo and Cocytus, Shalltear, Mare, and Aura.}}\nThis is a list of characters appearing in the novel series ''[[Overlord (novel series)|Overlord]]'', written by Kugane Maruyama and illustrated by so-bin, and its [[anime]] and [[manga]] adaptations.\n\n==Great Tomb of Nazarick==\nThe {{Nihongo|Great Tomb of Nazarick|\u30ca\u30b6\u30ea\u30c3\u30af \u5730\u4e0b\u5927\u58b3\u5893|Nazarikku Chika Dai Funbo}}, usually referred to as Nazarick, is the guild headquarters of the guild {{Nihongo|Ainz Ooal Gown|\u30a2\u30a4\u30f3\u30ba\u30fb\u30a6\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30b4\u30a6\u30f3|Ainzu \u016aru Goun}} in YGGDRASIL. Because it was a [[Player killers|PK]] guild, there were many attempts to conquer the dungeon, all of which ended in failure.\n\nAfter Nazarick was transported to the New World with Ainz and its custom NPCs, who became sentient as a result, the former began strengthening the tomb and collect information to protect it from possible threats. However, the NPCs mistook his intentions as preparing to take over the New World and began making their own plans. By the time Ainz realized this it was too late and he had no choice but to play along. This eventually led to Nazarick becoming its own nation, the {{Nihongo|Sorcerer Kingdom|\u9b54\u5c0e\u56fd|Mad\u014d Kuni}}.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Ainz Ooal Gown}}|\u30a2\u30a4\u30f3\u30ba\u30fb\u30a6\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30b4\u30a6\u30f3|Ainzu \u016aru Goun}} / {{Nihongo|Momonga|\u30e2\u30e2\u30f3\u30ac}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Satoshi Hino]] (drama CD, anime)|Chris Guerrero}}\n:The protagonist/main character and the only remaining member of the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown. Originally he was a simple salaryman playing a VR online game, but after he was transported to the New World, he decides to make himself a legend in hopes of finding his old guildmates. To facilitate his search, he changes his name from Momonga to Ainz Ooal Gown. While Ainz initially accidentally set Nazarick on a course for world domination after a comment he made was misinterpreted, he slowly grows into his role as a leader after deciding to create a kingdom where humans and non-humans are equal. As he has the form of a [[lich]], he doesn't need to eat or sleep, can't be poisoned or killed by conventional means, but also has his emotions and empathy suppressed. Because of his formerly high level in YGGDRASIL, he can easily overpower even the strongest of magic casters in the New World; and while he lacks the skills of natural warriors, he compensates for it with raw strength. Over time, he has learnt how to improve fighting with physical weapons, but his greatest asset remains his strength. Ainz also has access to a wide variety of instant death and summoning spells which, though ineffective against fellow players, work very well against the inhabitants of the New World. He also has an array of items he purchased with real money back in YGGDRASIL, which give him abilities ranging from summoning extremely high level items (most of which belong to his guildmates) from the Guild's bank to instantly casting a spell that usually has a long casting time. When Ainz travels as an adventurer, he uses the alias \"Momon\" which later becomes \"Momon the Dark Hero\". In the CD drama #2, his real name is revealed to be Satoru Suzuki.\n\n===Floor Guardians===\nThe {{Nihongo|Floor Guardians|\u968e\u5c64\u5b88\u8b77\u8005|Kais\u014d G\u0101dian}} are a group NPC's who act as bosses. They are among the most powerful beings in Nazarick, with some even exceeding Ainz in terms of pure stats.\n\nUpon coming to the New World, they came to life with personalities based on their backstories. They also gained great influence over Nazarick's affairs due to each of them being the leader of their respective floor. However, they remain absolutely loyal to Ainz.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Albedo}}|\u30a2\u30eb\u30d9\u30c9|Arubedo}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yumi Hara]] (drama CD, anime)|Elizabeth Maxwell}}\n:A [[succubus]] and the overseer of the Floor Guardians. She takes the form of a beautiful woman with black wings and horns wearing a white dress. Her beautiful and kind appearance hides her dark personality underneath. She was originally set to be a bitch, but Ainz modified her to be in love with him as a joke. As a result, upon coming to the New World, she became madly in love with him. She despises humans, viewing them as \"lower lifeforms\". She similarly harbors a secret hatred towards the other members of the Ainz Ooal Gown Guild for leaving Ainz. While in battle, she wears a suit of armor called ''Hermes Trismegistus'', which repels any physical damage, and fights using a [[bardiche]]. She also possesses the World Item ''Ginnungagap'', which can be used to devastate large areas.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Shalltear Bloodfallen|\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2\u30fb\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30eb\u30f3|Sharutia Buraddof\u014dren}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Sumire Uesaka]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Felecia Angelle]]}}\n:The Guardian of the First, Second, and Third floors of Nazarick. She takes on the form of a beautiful [[vampire]] girl. She is set to be somewhat of a pervert and a necrophile, causing her to fall for Ainz and putting her at odds with Albedo. She is the most powerful Floor Guardian in terms of overall stats, optimized for both melee and magic combat. Due to an incident where she was brainwashed by the Slane Theocracy, she unintentionally rebelled against Nazarick until she was killed by Ainz and later resurrected. Afterwards, she ended up blaming herself for her actions, even though she had no control of it. While she has since recovered somewhat, she maintains a constant sense of uncertainty and caution, while also belittling herself.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Aura Bella Fiora|\u30a2\u30a6\u30e9\u30fb\u30d9\u30e9\u30fb\u30d5\u30a3\u30aa\u30fc\u30e9|Aura Bera Fi\u014dra}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Emiri Kat\u014d]] (drama CD, anime)|Jill Harris}}\n:One of the Guardians of the Sixth floor of Nazarick, alongside her twin brother Mare. She takes on the form of a young Dark Elf who cross-dresses as a boy. She is also very energetic and extroverted, in contrast with her brother. Despite constantly bickering, she is very close to Shalltear, unintentionally mimicking the relationship between their creators. She fights with a whip and bow and can summon beasts to fight by her side. Ainz treats her and her brother as if they were his own children.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Mare Bello Fiore|\u30de\u30fc\u30ec\u30fb\u30d9\u30ed\u30fb\u30d5\u30a3\u30aa\u30fc\u30ec|M\u0101re Bero Fi\u014dre}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yumi Uchiyama]] (drama CD, anime)|Megan Shipman}}\n:One of the Guardians of the Sixth floor of Nazarick alongside his twin sister Aura. He takes on the form of a young Dark Elf who cross-dresses as a girl. He is also rather shy and calm (although, it is heavily implied, that he is actually just acting) in comparison to his sister, causing him to be constantly ordered around by her. Despite this, however, he can fight and be ruthless when necessary. He specializes in Druid magic, capable of twisting the earth to his whims. Ainz often treats him and his sister as if they were his own children.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Demiurge|\u30c7\u30df\u30a6\u30eb\u30b4\u30b9|Demiurugosu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Masayuki Kat\u014d]] (drama CD, anime)|Jeff Johnson}}\n:The Guardian of the seventh floor of Nazarick as well as the one in charge of its defenses. He takes on the form of a [[demon]] dressed in a business suit with glasses and a tail. He is among the most intelligent and evil NPCs of Nazarick, willing to commit unspeakable atrocities to further his goals. While getting along fine with the other Guardians, his relationship with Sebas is more strained due to their opposing natures which inherited from the guild members who created the two, who were also often at odds. There is also a lack of communication between him and Ainz, as the demon believes his liege can easily see through his intentions. To the population of the New World he is known as {{Nihongo|Jaldabaoth|\u30e4\u30eb\u30c0\u30d0\u30aa\u30c8|Yarudabaoto}}, an alternate identity that he assumed to further his goals without drawing suspicion.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Cocytus|\u30b3\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u30b9|Koky\u016btosu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kenta Miyake]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Bryan Massey]]}}\n:The Guardian of the Fifth floor of Nazarick. He takes on the form of a huge, four-armed, humanoid insect with the power of cryokinesis. He also possesses multiple swords, spears, halberds and other kinds of armaments. He has a warrior personality, which makes him very noble and respects anyone with a strong fighting spirit. He is in charge of the security of Nazarick and later becomes responsible for the Lizardmen tribes that Ainz had him conquer. Among his fellow Guardians, he is closest to Demiurge, who he sees a rival and a friend.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Victim|\u30f4\u30a3\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30e0|Vuikutimu}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Nao T\u014dyama]]|Marla Acevedo}}\n:The Guardian of the Eight Floor of Nazarick. It holds the appearance of a 1 meter long, pink fetus, with a halo and stick-like wings. It speaks Enochian language. It is Nazarick's last line of defense, with its only ability being a self-destruct skill. Despite this however, it is humble and modest about its function, believing its sole purpose is to serve the members of the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Gargantua|\u30ac\u30eb\u30ac\u30f3\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2|Garuganchua}}\n:The Guardian of the Fourth Floor. It is a stone golem with a height of over 30m. Unlike the other Floor Guardians, it is not a custom NPC but an in-game bonus won by the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown. As a result, it was not granted any personality or free will upon coming to the New World. Due to its unique nature, it is noted to be the strongest Floor Guardian, but due to its inability to react on its own, its strength falls considerably.\n\n===Area Guardians===\nArea Guardians serve as mini-bosses that guard a specific portion of a floor, which are usually very important locations. Some of them serve as subordinates to the Floor Guardians, while others act outside the chain of command.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Pandora's Actor|\u30d1\u30f3\u30c9\u30e9\u30ba\u30fb\u30a2\u30af\u30bf\u30fc|Pandorazu Akut\u0101}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mamoru Miyano]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Eric Vale]]}}\n:The Area Guardian of Nazarick's Treasury, created by Ainz himself. He is a doppelg\u00e4nger with an egghead with three holes as a face and is dressed in a military officer's uniform. He can also assume the appearance and abilities of every member of the Ainz Ooal Gown guild. Because of this, Ainz occasionally calls on him as a stand-in when situations require both Ainz and Momon to be active at the same time. Despite being an Area Guardian, his abilities rival a Floor Guardian. Because Ainz created him while going through a [[chuunibyou]] phase, he programmed him to act with exaggerated gestures and body language, which now greatly embarrasses him. Despite not getting to spend much time together, he and Ainz share a strong bond, with the latter secretly allowing the former to call him \"father\".\n\n====Five Worst====\nThe Five Worst is an unofficial group composed of the five most disgusting NPCs of Nazarick. Each member has something that is considered \"the worst,\" from appearance to occupation.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Kyouhukou|\u6050\u6016\u516c, \u304d\u3087\u3046\u3075\u3053\u3046|Ky\u014dfukou}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiroshi Kamiya]] (anime)|[[John Swasey]]}}\n:The Area Guardian of a region referred to as Black Capsule, which is filled with carnivorous cockroaches, and a member of Five Worst, holding the title \"Worst Residence\". He has the appearance of a 30cm tall Cockroach that walks on its hind legs and wears a small crown as well as a cloak with a small scepter, giving the impression that he is the king of cockroaches. Despite his appearance, he speaks politely with all the etiquette of a Gentleman.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Gashokukochuuou |\u9913\u98df\u72d0\u87f2\u738b|\nGashokukochuu\u014d}}\n:The Area Guardian of a region referred to as The Large Hole and a member of Five Worst, holding the title of \"Worst Appearance\". It is a parasitic creature, using humans as a \"House\".\n\n;{{Nihongo|Neuronist Painkill|\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30ed\u30cb\u30b9\u30c8\u30fb\u30da\u30a4\u30f3\u30ad\u30eb|\nNy\u016bronisuto Peinkiru}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Tessh\u014d Genda]] (anime)|[[Aaron Dismuke]]}}\n:Nazarick's Special Intelligence Investigator in charge of interrogating and torturing prisoners and a member of Five Worst, holding the title \"Worst Occupation\". She is a visibly hideous creature who speaks in a seductive and teasing tone that loses any appeal due to her similarly hideous voice. She also holds affections for Ainz, causing him to avoid her.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Chacmool|\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30af\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb|Chakkum\u014dru}}\n:Nazarick's musical instructor in charge of teaching the denizens of Nazarick on how play musical instruments and a member of Five Worst, holding the title \"Worst Personality\". He views humans as food or toys and requested Ainz for it and commands several Greater Doppelg\u00e4ngers.\n\n===Pleiades===\nThe {{Nihongo|Pleiades|\u30d7\u30ec\u30a2\u30c7\u30b9|Pureadesu}} are a group of NPCs dressed as maids lead by Sebas and who serve as Nazarick's last line of defence before the final floor. Despite each member, with the exception of Sebas, being weak by Nazarick's standards, their strength is equivalent to a legendary monster in the New World.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Sebas Tian|\u30bb\u30d0\u30b9\u30fb\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3|Sebasu Chan}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Shigeru Chiba]] (drama CD, anime)|Ed Blaylock (season 1), Bill Jenkins (season 2)}}\n:The head butler of Nazarick and overseer of the Pleiades. Despite not being a Floor Guardian, his abilities rival theirs, specializing in unarmed combat. He takes on the form of an elderly gentleman with a neat beard. Unlike the other NPCs, he doesn't hate outsiders and actually has a strong sense of justice, like his creator. Because of this, he has a habit of saving those in need, often bringing him in conflict with other NPCs and, on occasion, calling his loyalty to Ainz into question. He especially doesn't get along with Demiurge.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Yuri Alpha|\u30e6\u30ea\u30fb\u30a2\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1|Yuri Arufa}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiromi Igarashi]] (drama CD, anime)|Whitney Rodgers}}\n:The Vice-Captain, but de facto leader of the Pleiades. She is a [[Dullahan]] who uses a choker to keep her head attached to the rest of her body, causing her to appear to be human. She specializes in unarmed combat and uses Gauntlets in battle. She is programmed to behave like a teacher, because her creator was one, and the other Pleiades look up to her like a big sister. She holds a neutral stance towards humans, not disliking them but not helping them out either.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Lupusregina Beta|\u30eb\u30d7\u30b9\u30ec\u30ae\u30ca\u30fb\u30d9\u30fc\u30bf|Rupusuregina B\u0113ta}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mikako Komatsu]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Alexis Tipton]]}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She's a werewolf in human form and serves as the group's healer. In public, she is a sociable and friendly person who likes to make lewd jokes. However, in reality, she is a psychopath who enjoys using her healing abilities to slowly torture others to death. She is later assigned by Ainz to protect Carne Village.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Narberal Gamma|\u30ca\u30fc\u30d9\u30e9\u30eb\u30fb\u30ac\u30f3\u30de|N\u0101beraru Ganma}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Manami Numakura]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Anastasia Mu\u00f1oz]]}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She is a Doppelg\u00e4nger. However, because all her levels went into her combat abilities, she is permanently in human form. Instead, she is the strongest of the Pleiades, being a magic caster that specializes in lightning spells. She serves as Ainz' companion while under his \"Momon\" identity, going by the alias {{Nihongo|Nabe|\u30ca\u30fc\u30d9|N\u0101be}}. However, she despises and looks down on humans, which often causes trouble for him.\n\n;{{Nihongo|CZ2128 Delta|\u30b7\u30ba\u30fb\u30c7\u30eb\u30bf|Shizu Deruta}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Asami Seto]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Michelle Rojas]]}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She's an automaton who fights using guns and war knives. While silent and emotionless, she holds no particular dislike towards humans.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Solution Epsilon|\u30bd\u30ea\u30e5\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3\u30fb\u30a4\u30d7\u30b7\u30ed\u30f3|Soryushan Ipushiron}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ayane Sakura]] (drama CD, anime)|Mallorie Rodak}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She is a Slime that takes on a human form. She is an assassin and can absorb people and objects into her body to be stored or devoured. Being a Slime, she preys on humans and generally despises and looks down on them.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Entoma Vasilissa Zeta|\u30a8\u30f3\u30c8\u30de\u30fb\u30f4\u30a1\u30b7\u30ea\u30c3\u30b5\u30fb\u30bc\u30fc\u30bf|Entoma Vuashirissa Z\u0113ta}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kei Shindo]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Tia Ballard]]}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She is an Insectoid who disguises herself as a human by wearing a mask and changing her voice. She is an entomancer, being able to summon fellow Insectoids. Being an Insectoid, she preys on humans when hungry, but otherwise doesn't consider them worth her attention. She harbors a grudge towards Evileye from the Adventurer Group Blue Rose, who defeated and humiliated her.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Aureole Omega|\u30aa\u30fc\u30ec\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30aa\u30e1\u30ac|\u014cre\u014dru Omega}}\n:The leader of Pleiades and the Area Guardian of the region known as the Cherry Blossom Sanctuary. Due to her dual positions, she is unable to lead the group most of the time, causing Yuri Alpha to serve as leader in her stead. She is in charge of Nazarick's Teleportation Gates. She stated to be to only Human NPC in Nazarick. However, most don't consider her human due to her being immortal. Ainz seems to trust her a great deal, entrusting her with the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown whenever he leaves Nazarick.\n\n===Others===\n;{{nihongo|Pestonya Shortcake Wanko|\u30da\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30cb\u30e3\u30fb\u30b7\u30e7\u30fc\u30c8\u30b1\u30fc\u30ad\u30fb\u30ef\u30f3\u30b3|Pesut\u014dnya Sh\u014dtok\u0113ki Wanko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Satomi Arai]]|[[Jamie Marchi]]}}\n:The Head-Maid of Nazarick. She has the body of a human but the head of a Shetland Sheepdog with a vertical scar on her face running down the center of her face. She harbors no dislike towards human and is even willing to rescue them from her fellow NPCs' cruelty.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Eclair Ecleir Eicler|\u30a8\u30af\u30ec\u30a2\u30fb\u30a8\u30af\u30ec\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30a8\u30a4\u30af\u30ec\u30a2\u30fc|\nEkurea Ekur\u0113ru Eikure\u0101}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Nobuyuki Hiyama]]|Kyle Phillips}}\n:The assistant butler of Nazarick. He takes on the form of an emperor penguin with a superiority complex. He has been programmed with a desire to overthrow Ainz and take over Nazarick as a gag by his creator. The other NPCs are fully aware of this, but they don't care as he poses no threat and they know it is just a part of his settings.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Nigredo|\u30cb\u30b0\u30ec\u30c9|Niguredo}}\n:The older sister of Albedo, being created by the same creator. She specializes in information gathering. While she bears some similarity to Albedo, her face has no skin, resulting in a twisted appearance. Her mind is similarly broken, unless a baby-doll is given to her. However, while she has a body-doll, is actually one of the few NPCs of Nazarick that is genuinely kind-hearted. Despite being polar opposites in appearance and personality, she and Albedo generally get along just fine.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Rubedo|\u30eb\u30d9\u30c9|\nRubedo}}\n:The Younger sister of Albedo and Nigredo, being created by the same creator. She is the strongest NPC in Nazarick. Not much is known about her, but Albedo loves her while Nigredo fears her.\n\n==New World==\nThe New World is the world where Nazarick was transported to. There seems to be some sort of connection between this world and \"YGGDRASIL\", as it is implied that Players from the game are transported to it every couple of centuries. The world once had its own form of magic known as \"Wild Magic\". However, after Players introduced their \"Tier Magic\", it became more and more scarce. This world's inhabitants are also extremely weak by Player standards.\n\n===Nazarick's Allies===\nUpon arriving in the New World, Nazarick began rapidly expanding its influence. While Ainz obtained the loyalty of the world's inhabitants though mostly peaceful methods, the NPCs violently conquered any territory they laid their eyes on.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Hamsuke/The Wise King of the Forest|\u30cf\u30e0\u30b9\u30b1|Hamusuke}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Akeno Watanabe]] (drama CD, anime)|Heather Walker}}\n:A giant female Hamster with a snake-like tail that lived in the forest near Carne Village. She was thought to be the strongest beast among the forest denizens. While publicly known as \"The Wise King of the Forest\", she's actually more-or-less a dense idiot, though she is capable of human speech. Upon learning about her, Momon (Ainz' Adventurer Persona) seeks her out to increase his fame. Upon finding her, however, he is extremely disappointed, not understanding what others see in her, and proceeds to easily defeat her. He then promptly tames her and names her \"Hamsuke\". She then joins Ainz's adventurer group as his registered beast and totally devotes herself to him. While initially arrogant due to being strong by the New World's standards, upon meeting Nazarick's NPCs she realizes her weakness and devotes herself to becoming stronger.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Tuareninya Veyron|\u30c4\u30a2\u30ec\u30cb\u30fc\u30cb\u30e3\u30fb\u30d9\u30a4\u30ed\u30f3|Tsuaren\u012bnya Beiron}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Y\u016b Shimamura]] (Japanese)|Rachel Glass}}\n:Nazarick's newest apprentice-maid under Sebas Tian's supervision. She was a slave of Eight Fingers until Sebas found and saved her while on a mission. He nursed her back to health and she slowly opened up to him, eventually even developing a crush on him. However, this brought Sebas' loyalty to Ainz in question and they were both forced to appear before him. Learning about Ainz didn't change her feelings towards Sebas, however, as she was willing to let him kill her to prove his loyalty. Luckily, this was merely a test and her life was spared. She was then revealed that be the older sister of Ninya Berion, who Ainz felt indebted to, causing him to take her under his protection. As of now, she remains unaware of her younger sister's passing.\n\n====Carne Village====\n{{Nihongo|Carne Village|\u30ab\u30eb\u30cd\u6751|Karune Mura}} is a small village located at the border of the Re-Estize Kingdom, close to the Great {{Nihongo|Forest of Tob|\u30c8\u30d6\u306e\u5927\u68ee\u6797|Tobu No Dai Shinrin}} where various demi-humans, including Nazarick, reside.\n\nAfter Ainz saved the village from the Slane Theocracy, the villagers become loyal to him, even siding with Nazarick when it went to war with the Re-Estize Kingdom. The village has since started to take in other races including: Goblins summoned by an item Ainz gave them, Ogres from the Great Forest of Tob, and Dwarfs from the Dwarf Kingdom.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Enri Emmot|\u30a8\u30f3\u30ea\u30fb\u30a8\u30e2\u30c3\u30c8|Enri Emotto}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mao Ichimichi|M\u00b7A\u00b7O]] (anime)|Skyler McIntosh}}\n:A girl from the Carne Village who was saved by Ainz from soldiers of the Sunlight Scripture. Ainz gives her 2 Goblin-Summoning Horns that she would eventually use to protect her village. Enri shares a close bond with her childhood friend, and lover after the events of the 8th light novel, Nfirea. She and all the other villagers admire and respect Ainz for saving them from Nigun, and willingly leave the Kingdom when the crown prince attempt to force them into joining the fight against Ainz in the 9th novel. Carne Village becomes part of Ainz' territory once he wins the war. It is revealed in the 11th light novel that she and Nfirea have gotten married and moved into their own house.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Nemu Emmot|\u30cd\u30e0\u30fb\u30a8\u30e2\u30c3\u30c8|Nemu Emotto}}\n:{{Voiced by|Marika Kono (anime)|Jeannie Tirado}}\n:A girl from the Carne Village and Enri's younger sister who was saved by Ainz from soldiers of the Sunlight Scripture. When Enri and Nfirea are invited to Nazarick for dinner she joins them. She is amazed by Ainz' wealth and the beauty of Nazarick, which amuses Ainz greatly and he shows her most of the tomb, personally.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Nfirea Bareare|\u30f3\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30ec\u30a2\u30fb\u30d0\u30ec\u30a2\u30ec|Nf\u012brea Bareare}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ayumu Murase]] (anime)|Morgan Berry}}\n:A famous pharmacist in the city E-Rantel. He is the grandson of Lizzie Bareare and the childhood friend of Enri Emmot. He has an innate talent of being able to use any magic item.

In response to this, the king created a new title just for him: 'Warrior Captain', and gave him his own 'Warrior Troop' to command. He first met Ainz while investigating the destruction of several villages and came to greatly respect him due to him saving Carne Village. Unfortunately, they later became enemies when the Kingdom and Nazarick went to war with each other. He challenged Ainz to a one-on-one duel where the latter reluctantly killed him. Before his death, he wished not to be resurrected should he lose, so Ainz honored his wish by casting a spell on him that invalidates resurrection.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Brain Unglaus|\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30a2\u30f3\u30b0\u30e9\u30a6\u30b9|Burein Angurausu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Koji Yusa]] (anime)|Chad Halbrook}}\n:A warrior turned mercenary who sees himself as Gazef's rival.

He regains his will when he sees Climb withstand the intense killing intent from Sebas, understanding that humans can still change and become stronger.

However, he remains unaware of Renner's true nature. He is rather disliked due to him having such a position despite not even being a commoner, but an urchin. Despite this position, he holds no talent at fighting, making up for it with sheer effort.

Unbeknownst to the public, however, the 'real' Caspond is long dead, replaced by a D\u00f6ppelganger serving Demiurge and is currently working to destabilize the Holy Kingdom.\n\n====Temple of the Four Great Gods====\nThe Temple of the Four Great Gods is the primary religious institution of the Holy Kingdom.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Kelart Custodio|\u30b1\u30e9\u30eb\u30c8\u30fb\u30ab\u30b9\u30c8\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa|Keraruto Kasutodio}}\n:The High Priestess of Holy Kingdom and younger sister of Remedios. She is similar to her sister, but calmer. She is also a powerful magic caster by New World standards. When Jaldabaoth attacked the Holy Kingdom, she was by Holy Queen Calca's side as she faced him, but they were defeated and she was killed. Her head was later taken by a demon and used for magic, before the demon was defeated by Neia and CZ.\n\n====Nine Colors====\nThe {{Nihongo|Nine Colors|\u4e5d\u8272|Ky\u016b-shoku}} is a group of individuals who's skills were recognized by the Holy Kingdom. Each member is titled after a color.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Pavel Baraja|\u30d1\u30d9\u30eb\u30fb\u30d0\u30e9\u30cf|Paberu Baraha}}\n:One of the Nine Colors and Neia Baraja's father. He was an expert archer. He was killed when Jaldabaoth (Demiurge is disguise) attacked the Holy Kingdom.

He possessed a unique technique that was so powerful that it would result in his weapon breaking. Because of this, he carried up to eight swords with him into battle. He was killed when Jaldabaoth (Demiurge in disguise) attacked the Holy Kingdom. His Color is unknown.\n\n===Others===\nCharacters and organizations not allied with any nation or larger group.\n\n====Thirteen Heroes====\nThe {{Nihongo|Thirteen Heroes|\u5341\u4e09\u82f1\u96c4|J\u016bsan Eiy\u016b}} is a group of legendary figures in the New World. 200 years ago, they defeated the monsters known as the \"Evil Deities\" (who were strongly hinted to be NPCs from YGGDRASIL). At least two of members, including the leader, were Players from YGGDRASIL. Also, despite the name, there were actually more than thirteen members. However, the others were non-humans and thus weren't honored.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Rigrit Bers Caurau|\u30ea\u30b0\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30d9\u30eb\u30b9\u30fc\u30fb\u30ab\u30a6\u30e9\u30a6|Riguritto Berus\u016b Kaurau}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Masako Nozawa]]|[[Wendy Powell]]}}\n:A member of the Thirteen Heroes 200 years ago. She is a Necromancer who used her abilities to extend her life beyond natural limits. Despite her age, she maintains a cheerful and mischievous personality. She was also a member of Blue Rose for a while, being the one who transformed it into a top-ranked Adventurer group, but retired and forced Evileye to take her place on the team. She sees Nazarick as a great threat to the New World.\n\n====Dragon Lords====\n{{Nihongo|Dragon Lord|\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30ed\u30fc\u30c9|Doragonr\u014ddo}} is a title for the most powerful dragons in the New World. As dragons are the strongest species, Dragon Lords are the strongest beings in the New World. However, around 500 years ago, they went to war with the YGGDRASIL players known as the {{Nihongo|Eight Greed Kings|\u516b\u6b32\u738b|Hachiyoku-o}} and lost, resulting in their kind being reduced to a handful.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Tsaindorcus Vaision|\u30c4\u30a1\u30a4\u30f3\u30c9\u30eb\u30af\u30b9\uff1d\u30f4\u30a1\u30a4\u30b7\u30aa\u30f3|Tsuaindorukusu vuaishion}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Jin Yamanoi]]|[[R. Bruce Elliot]]}}\n:Also known as the 'Platinum Dragon Lord'; he is a Dragon Lord and presumably the 'most powerful being in the New World'. He resides at the castle of the former Eight Greed Kings, guarding their magic items to prevent them from ever falling into the wrong hands. He sees Nazarick as a great threat to the New World.\n\n====Zurrernorn====\n{{Nihongo|Zurrernorn|\u30ba\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc\u30ce\u30fc\u30f3|Z\u016br\u0101n\u014dn}} is a criminal cult infamous for its uses of necromancy and the Undead.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Clementine|\u30af\u30ec\u30de\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30cc|Kuremant\u012bnu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Aoi Y\u016bki]] (drama CD, anime)|Mikaela Krantz}}\n:A rogue warrior and a former member of the Slane Theocracy\u00b4s Black Scripture. She was psychopath who wore armor made from medals from Adventurers she has slain. She was not an actual member of Zurrernorn, but merely associated with them for protection. She was killed by Momon (Ainz\u00b4 Adventurer persona), when he crushed her spine. However, her body mysteriously disappeared in the aftermath.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Khajiit Dale Badantel|\u30ab\u30b8\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30c7\u30a4\u30eb\u30fb\u30d0\u30c0\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30eb|Kajitto Deiru Badant\u0113ru}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Minoru Inaba]] (drama CD, anime)|Brad Venable}}\n:One of the twelve core members of Zuranon.

Because it was a [[Player killers|PK]] guild, there were many attempts to conquer the dungeon, all of which ended in failure.\n\nAfter Nazarick was transported to the New World with Ainz and its custom NPCs, who became sentient as a result, the former began strengthening the tomb and collect information to protect it from possible threats. However, the NPCs mistook his intentions as preparing to take over the New World and began making their own plans. By the time Ainz realized this it was too late and he had no choice but to play along. This eventually led to Nazarick becoming its own nation, the {{Nihongo|Sorcerer Kingdom|\u9b54\u5c0e\u56fd|Mad\u014d Kuni}}.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Ainz Ooal Gown}}|\u30a2\u30a4\u30f3\u30ba\u30fb\u30a6\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30b4\u30a6\u30f3|Ainzu \u016aru Goun}} / {{Nihongo|Momonga|\u30e2\u30e2\u30f3\u30ac}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Satoshi Hino]] (drama CD, anime)|Chris Guerrero}}\n:The protagonist/main character and the only remaining member of the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown. Originally he was a simple salaryman playing a VR online game, but after he was transported to the New World, he decides to make himself a legend in hopes of finding his old guildmates. To facilitate his search, he changes his name from Momonga to Ainz Ooal Gown. While Ainz initially accidentally set Nazarick on a course for world domination after a comment he made was misinterpreted, he slowly grows into his role as a leader after deciding to create a kingdom where humans and non-humans are equal. As he has the form of a [[lich]], he doesn't need to eat or sleep, can't be poisoned or killed by conventional means, but also has his emotions and empathy suppressed. Because of his formerly high level in YGGDRASIL, he can easily overpower even the strongest of magic casters in the New World; and while he lacks the skills of natural warriors, he compensates for it with raw strength. Over time, he has learnt how to improve fighting with physical weapons, but his greatest asset remains his strength. Ainz also has access to a wide variety of instant death and summoning spells which, though ineffective against fellow players, work very well against the inhabitants of the New World. He also has an array of items he purchased with real money back in YGGDRASIL, which give him abilities ranging from summoning extremely high level items (most of which belong to his guildmates) from the Guild's bank to instantly casting a spell that usually has a long casting time. When Ainz travels as an adventurer, he uses the alias \"Momon\" which later becomes \"Momon the Dark Hero\". In the CD drama #2, his real name is revealed to be Satoru Suzuki.\n\n===Floor Guardians===\nThe {{Nihongo|Floor Guardians|\u968e\u5c64\u5b88\u8b77\u8005|Kais\u014d G\u0101dian}} are a group NPC's who act as bosses. They are among the most powerful beings in Nazarick, with some even exceeding Ainz in terms of pure stats.\n\nUpon coming to the New World, they came to life with personalities based on their backstories. They also gained great influence over Nazarick's affairs due to each of them being the leader of their respective floor. However, they remain absolutely loyal to Ainz.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Albedo}}|\u30a2\u30eb\u30d9\u30c9|Arubedo}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yumi Hara]] (drama CD, anime)|Elizabeth Maxwell}}\n:A [[succubus]] and the overseer of the Floor Guardians. She takes the form of a beautiful woman with black wings and horns wearing a white dress. Her beautiful and kind appearance hides her dark personality underneath. She was originally set to be a bitch, but Ainz modified her to be in love with him as a joke. As a result, upon coming to the New World, she became madly in love with him. She despises humans, viewing them as \"lower lifeforms\". She similarly harbors a secret hatred towards the other members of the Ainz Ooal Gown Guild for leaving Ainz. While in battle, she wears a suit of armor called ''Hermes Trismegistus'', which repels any physical damage, and fights using a [[bardiche]]. She also possesses the World Item ''Ginnungagap'', which can be used to devastate large areas.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Shalltear Bloodfallen|\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2\u30fb\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30eb\u30f3|Sharutia Buraddof\u014dren}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Sumire Uesaka]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Felecia Angelle]]}}\n:The Guardian of the First, Second, and Third floors of Nazarick. She takes on the form of a beautiful [[vampire]] girl. She is set to be somewhat of a pervert and a necrophile, causing her to fall for Ainz and putting her at odds with Albedo. She is the most powerful Floor Guardian in terms of overall stats, optimized for both melee and magic combat. Due to an incident where she was brainwashed by the Slane Theocracy, she unintentionally rebelled against Nazarick until she was killed by Ainz and later resurrected. Afterwards, she ended up blaming herself for her actions, even though she had no control of it. While she has since recovered somewhat, she maintains a constant sense of uncertainty and caution, while also belittling herself.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Aura Bella Fiora|\u30a2\u30a6\u30e9\u30fb\u30d9\u30e9\u30fb\u30d5\u30a3\u30aa\u30fc\u30e9|Aura Bera Fi\u014dra}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Emiri Kat\u014d]] (drama CD, anime)|Jill Harris}}\n:One of the Guardians of the Sixth floor of Nazarick, alongside her twin brother Mare. She takes on the form of a young Dark Elf who cross-dresses as a boy. She is also very energetic and extroverted, in contrast with her brother. Despite constantly bickering, she is very close to Shalltear, unintentionally mimicking the relationship between their creators. She fights with a whip and bow and can summon beasts to fight by her side. Ainz treats her and her brother as if they were his own children.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Mare Bello Fiore|\u30de\u30fc\u30ec\u30fb\u30d9\u30ed\u30fb\u30d5\u30a3\u30aa\u30fc\u30ec|M\u0101re Bero Fi\u014dre}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yumi Uchiyama]] (drama CD, anime)|Megan Shipman}}\n:One of the Guardians of the Sixth floor of Nazarick alongside his twin sister Aura. He takes on the form of a young Dark Elf who cross-dresses as a girl. He is also rather shy and calm (although, it is heavily implied, that he is actually just acting) in comparison to his sister, causing him to be constantly ordered around by her. Despite this, however, he can fight and be ruthless when necessary. He specializes in Druid magic, capable of twisting the earth to his whims. Ainz often treats him and his sister as if they were his own children.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Demiurge|\u30c7\u30df\u30a6\u30eb\u30b4\u30b9|Demiurugosu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Masayuki Kat\u014d]] (drama CD, anime)|Jeff Johnson}}\n:The Guardian of the seventh floor of Nazarick as well as the one in charge of its defenses. He takes on the form of a [[demon]] dressed in a business suit with glasses and a tail. He is among the most intelligent and evil NPCs of Nazarick, willing to commit unspeakable atrocities to further his goals. While getting along fine with the other Guardians, his relationship with Sebas is more strained due to their opposing natures which inherited from the guild members who created the two, who were also often at odds. There is also a lack of communication between him and Ainz, as the demon believes his liege can easily see through his intentions. To the population of the New World he is known as {{Nihongo|Jaldabaoth|\u30e4\u30eb\u30c0\u30d0\u30aa\u30c8|Yarudabaoto}}, an alternate identity that he assumed to further his goals without drawing suspicion.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Cocytus|\u30b3\u30ad\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u30b9|Koky\u016btosu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kenta Miyake]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Bryan Massey]]}}\n:The Guardian of the Fifth floor of Nazarick. He takes on the form of a huge, four-armed, humanoid insect with the power of cryokinesis. He also possesses multiple swords, spears, halberds and other kinds of armaments. He has a warrior personality, which makes him very noble and respects anyone with a strong fighting spirit. He is in charge of the security of Nazarick and later becomes responsible for the Lizardmen tribes that Ainz had him conquer. Among his fellow Guardians, he is closest to Demiurge, who he sees a rival and a friend.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Victim|\u30f4\u30a3\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30e0|Vuikutimu}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Nao T\u014dyama]]|Marla Acevedo}}\n:The Guardian of the Eight Floor of Nazarick. It holds the appearance of a 1 meter long, pink fetus, with a halo and stick-like wings. It speaks Enochian language. It is Nazarick's last line of defense, with its only ability being a self-destruct skill. Despite this however, it is humble and modest about its function, believing its sole purpose is to serve the members of the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Gargantua|\u30ac\u30eb\u30ac\u30f3\u30c1\u30e5\u30a2|Garuganchua}}\n:The Guardian of the Fourth Floor. It is a stone golem with a height of over 30m. Unlike the other Floor Guardians, it is not a custom NPC but an in-game bonus won by the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown. As a result, it was not granted any personality or free will upon coming to the New World. Due to its unique nature, it is noted to be the strongest Floor Guardian, but due to its inability to react on its own, its strength falls considerably.\n\n===Area Guardians===\nArea Guardians serve as mini-bosses that guard a specific portion of a floor, which are usually very important locations. Some of them serve as subordinates to the Floor Guardians, while others act outside the chain of command.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Pandora's Actor|\u30d1\u30f3\u30c9\u30e9\u30ba\u30fb\u30a2\u30af\u30bf\u30fc|Pandorazu Akut\u0101}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mamoru Miyano]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Eric Vale]]}}\n:The Area Guardian of Nazarick's Treasury, created by Ainz himself. He is a doppelg\u00e4nger with an egghead with three holes as a face and is dressed in a military officer's uniform. He can also assume the appearance and abilities of every member of the Ainz Ooal Gown guild. Because of this, Ainz occasionally calls on him as a stand-in when situations require both Ainz and Momon to be active at the same time. Despite being an Area Guardian, his abilities rival a Floor Guardian. Because Ainz created him while going through a [[chuunibyou]] phase, he programmed him to act with exaggerated gestures and body language, which now greatly embarrasses him. Despite not getting to spend much time together, he and Ainz share a strong bond, with the latter secretly allowing the former to call him \"father\".\n\n====Five Worst====\nThe Five Worst is an unofficial group composed of the five most disgusting NPCs of Nazarick. Each member has something that is considered \"the worst,\" from appearance to occupation.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Kyouhukou|\u6050\u6016\u516c, \u304d\u3087\u3046\u3075\u3053\u3046|Ky\u014dfukou}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiroshi Kamiya]] (anime)|[[John Swasey]]}}\n:The Area Guardian of a region referred to as Black Capsule, which is filled with carnivorous cockroaches, and a member of Five Worst, holding the title \"Worst Residence\". He has the appearance of a 30cm tall Cockroach that walks on its hind legs and wears a small crown as well as a cloak with a small scepter, giving the impression that he is the king of cockroaches. Despite his appearance, he speaks politely with all the etiquette of a Gentleman.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Gashokukochuuou |\u9913\u98df\u72d0\u87f2\u738b|\nGashokukochuu\u014d}}\n:The Area Guardian of a region referred to as The Large Hole and a member of Five Worst, holding the title of \"Worst Appearance\". It is a parasitic creature, using humans as a \"House\".\n\n;{{Nihongo|Neuronist Painkill|\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30ed\u30cb\u30b9\u30c8\u30fb\u30da\u30a4\u30f3\u30ad\u30eb|\nNy\u016bronisuto Peinkiru}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Tessh\u014d Genda]] (anime)|[[Aaron Dismuke]]}}\n:Nazarick's Special Intelligence Investigator in charge of interrogating and torturing prisoners and a member of Five Worst, holding the title \"Worst Occupation\". She is a visibly hideous creature who speaks in a seductive and teasing tone that loses any appeal due to her similarly hideous voice. She also holds affections for Ainz, causing him to avoid her.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Chacmool|\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30af\u30e2\u30fc\u30eb|Chakkum\u014dru}}\n:Nazarick's musical instructor in charge of teaching the denizens of Nazarick on how play musical instruments and a member of Five Worst, holding the title \"Worst Personality\". He views humans as food or toys and requested Ainz for it and commands several Greater Doppelg\u00e4ngers.\n\n===Pleiades===\nThe {{Nihongo|Pleiades|\u30d7\u30ec\u30a2\u30c7\u30b9|Pureadesu}} are a group of NPCs dressed as maids lead by Sebas and who serve as Nazarick's last line of defence before the final floor. Despite each member, with the exception of Sebas, being weak by Nazarick's standards, their strength is equivalent to a legendary monster in the New World.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Sebas Tian|\u30bb\u30d0\u30b9\u30fb\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3|Sebasu Chan}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Shigeru Chiba]] (drama CD, anime)|Ed Blaylock (season 1), Bill Jenkins (season 2)}}\n:The head butler of Nazarick and overseer of the Pleiades. Despite not being a Floor Guardian, his abilities rival theirs, specializing in unarmed combat. He takes on the form of an elderly gentleman with a neat beard. Unlike the other NPCs, he doesn't hate outsiders and actually has a strong sense of justice, like his creator. Because of this, he has a habit of saving those in need, often bringing him in conflict with other NPCs and, on occasion, calling his loyalty to Ainz into question. He especially doesn't get along with Demiurge.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Yuri Alpha|\u30e6\u30ea\u30fb\u30a2\u30eb\u30d5\u30a1|Yuri Arufa}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiromi Igarashi]] (drama CD, anime)|Whitney Rodgers}}\n:The Vice-Captain, but de facto leader of the Pleiades. She is a [[Dullahan]] who uses a choker to keep her head attached to the rest of her body, causing her to appear to be human. She specializes in unarmed combat and uses Gauntlets in battle. She is programmed to behave like a teacher, because her creator was one, and the other Pleiades look up to her like a big sister. She holds a neutral stance towards humans, not disliking them but not helping them out either.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Lupusregina Beta|\u30eb\u30d7\u30b9\u30ec\u30ae\u30ca\u30fb\u30d9\u30fc\u30bf|Rupusuregina B\u0113ta}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mikako Komatsu]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Alexis Tipton]]}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She's a werewolf in human form and serves as the group's healer. In public, she is a sociable and friendly person who likes to make lewd jokes. However, in reality, she is a psychopath who enjoys using her healing abilities to slowly torture others to death. She is later assigned by Ainz to protect Carne Village.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Narberal Gamma|\u30ca\u30fc\u30d9\u30e9\u30eb\u30fb\u30ac\u30f3\u30de|N\u0101beraru Ganma}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Manami Numakura]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Anastasia Mu\u00f1oz]]}}\n:One of the Pleiades. She is a Doppelg\u00e4nger. However, because all her levels went into her combat abilities, she is permanently in human form. Instead, she is the strongest of the Pleiades, being a magic caster that specializes in lightning spells. She serves as Ainz' companion while under his \"Momon\" identity, going by the alias {{Nihongo|Nabe|\u30ca\u30fc\u30d9|N\u0101be}}. However, she despises and looks down on humans, which often causes trouble for him.\n\n;{{Nihongo|CZ2128 Delta|\u30b7\u30ba\u30fb\u30c7\u30eb\u30bf|Shizu Deruta}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Asami Seto]] (drama CD, anime)|[[Michelle Rojas]]}}\n:One of the Pleiades.

She harbors a grudge towards Evileye from the Adventurer Group Blue Rose, who defeated and humiliated her.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Aureole Omega|\u30aa\u30fc\u30ec\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30aa\u30e1\u30ac|\u014cre\u014dru Omega}}\n:The leader of Pleiades and the Area Guardian of the region known as the Cherry Blossom Sanctuary. Due to her dual positions, she is unable to lead the group most of the time, causing Yuri Alpha to serve as leader in her stead. She is in charge of Nazarick's Teleportation Gates. She stated to be to only Human NPC in Nazarick. However, most don't consider her human due to her being immortal.

He takes on the form of an emperor penguin with a superiority complex. He has been programmed with a desire to overthrow Ainz and take over Nazarick as a gag by his creator. The other NPCs are fully aware of this, but they don't care as he poses no threat and they know it is just a part of his settings.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Nigredo|\u30cb\u30b0\u30ec\u30c9|Niguredo}}\n:The older sister of Albedo, being created by the same creator. She specializes in information gathering. While she bears some similarity to Albedo, her face has no skin, resulting in a twisted appearance. Her mind is similarly broken, unless a baby-doll is given to her. However, while she has a body-doll, is actually one of the few NPCs of Nazarick that is genuinely kind-hearted. Despite being polar opposites in appearance and personality, she and Albedo generally get along just fine.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Rubedo|\u30eb\u30d9\u30c9|\nRubedo}}\n:The Younger sister of Albedo and Nigredo, being created by the same creator. She is the strongest NPC in Nazarick. Not much is known about her, but Albedo loves her while Nigredo fears her.\n\n==New World==\nThe New World is the world where Nazarick was transported to. There seems to be some sort of connection between this world and \"YGGDRASIL\", as it is implied that Players from the game are transported to it every couple of centuries. The world once had its own form of magic known as \"Wild Magic\". However, after Players introduced their \"Tier Magic\", it became more and more scarce. This world's inhabitants are also extremely weak by Player standards.\n\n===Nazarick's Allies===\nUpon arriving in the New World, Nazarick began rapidly expanding its influence. While Ainz obtained the loyalty of the world's inhabitants though mostly peaceful methods, the NPCs violently conquered any territory they laid their eyes on.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Hamsuke/The Wise King of the Forest|\u30cf\u30e0\u30b9\u30b1|Hamusuke}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Akeno Watanabe]] (drama CD, anime)|Heather Walker}}\n:A giant female Hamster with a snake-like tail that lived in the forest near Carne Village. She was thought to be the strongest beast among the forest denizens. While publicly known as \"The Wise King of the Forest\", she's actually more-or-less a dense idiot, though she is capable of human speech. Upon learning about her, Momon (Ainz' Adventurer Persona) seeks her out to increase his fame. Upon finding her, however, he is extremely disappointed, not understanding what others see in her, and proceeds to easily defeat her. He then promptly tames her and names her \"Hamsuke\". She then joins Ainz's adventurer group as his registered beast and totally devotes herself to him. While initially arrogant due to being strong by the New World's standards, upon meeting Nazarick's NPCs she realizes her weakness and devotes herself to becoming stronger.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Tuareninya Veyron|\u30c4\u30a2\u30ec\u30cb\u30fc\u30cb\u30e3\u30fb\u30d9\u30a4\u30ed\u30f3|Tsuaren\u012bnya Beiron}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Y\u016b Shimamura]] (Japanese)|Rachel Glass}}\n:Nazarick's newest apprentice-maid under Sebas Tian's supervision. She was a slave of Eight Fingers until Sebas found and saved her while on a mission. He nursed her back to health and she slowly opened up to him, eventually even developing a crush on him. However, this brought Sebas' loyalty to Ainz in question and they were both forced to appear before him. Learning about Ainz didn't change her feelings towards Sebas, however, as she was willing to let him kill her to prove his loyalty. Luckily, this was merely a test and her life was spared. She was then revealed that be the older sister of Ninya Berion, who Ainz felt indebted to, causing him to take her under his protection. As of now, she remains unaware of her younger sister's passing.\n\n====Carne Village====\n{{Nihongo|Carne Village|\u30ab\u30eb\u30cd\u6751|Karune Mura}} is a small village located at the border of the Re-Estize Kingdom, close to the Great {{Nihongo|Forest of Tob|\u30c8\u30d6\u306e\u5927\u68ee\u6797|Tobu No Dai Shinrin}} where various demi-humans, including Nazarick, reside.\n\nAfter Ainz saved the village from the Slane Theocracy, the villagers become loyal to him, even siding with Nazarick when it went to war with the Re-Estize Kingdom. The village has since started to take in other races including: Goblins summoned by an item Ainz gave them, Ogres from the Great Forest of Tob, and Dwarfs from the Dwarf Kingdom.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Enri Emmot|\u30a8\u30f3\u30ea\u30fb\u30a8\u30e2\u30c3\u30c8|Enri Emotto}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mao Ichimichi|M\u00b7A\u00b7O]] (anime)|Skyler McIntosh}}\n:A girl from the Carne Village who was saved by Ainz from soldiers of the Sunlight Scripture.

She and all the other villagers admire and respect Ainz for saving them from Nigun, and willingly leave the Kingdom when the crown prince attempt to force them into joining the fight against Ainz in the 9th novel. Carne Village becomes part of Ainz' territory once he wins the war. It is revealed in the 11th light novel that she and Nfirea have gotten married and moved into their own house.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Nemu Emmot|\u30cd\u30e0\u30fb\u30a8\u30e2\u30c3\u30c8|Nemu Emotto}}\n:{{Voiced by|Marika Kono (anime)|Jeannie Tirado}}\n:A girl from the Carne Village and Enri's younger sister who was saved by Ainz from soldiers of the Sunlight Scripture.

Nfirea harbors romantic feelings for Enri, which eventually come to fruition. He manages to create a Purple potion, out of materials from Nazarick and the new world, which works better than the blue potion but still less than Yggdrasil's Red Potion. Ainz is pleased with this step forward but hopes that he can at least make this kind of potion out of materials from the New World. It is revealed in the 11th light novel, that he and Enri have gotten married and are living in their own house.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Brita|\u30d6\u30ea\u30bf|Burita}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Satsuki Yukino]] (anime)|Katherine Bourne}}\n:The brash and often short-tempered leader of the vigilante committee of Carne Village and a former iron ranked adventurer. Brita first encountered \"Momon\" (Ainz's alias as an adventurer) when he accidentally destroyed her potion in a tavern. Ainz decides to give her a special red potion to make up for her loss. This potion ends up saving her life during Shalltear's rampage, since it made the vampire interrogate her instead of just killing her. She quits being an adventurer after encountering Shalltear and moves to Carne Village, where she ends up assisting the people. She also joins the Villagers in fighting against the Kingdom and for Ainz in the 9th Novel.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Lizzie Bareare|\u30ea\u30a3\u30b8\u30fc\u30fb\u30d0\u30ec\u30a2\u30ec|Ryij\u012b Bareare}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ikuko Tani]] (anime)|[[Juli Erickson]]}}\n:Nfirea's grandmother, considered the best pharmacist in E-Rantel.

She and Nfirea are then later sent to Carne Village where they are told to create a Red Potion from Yggdrasil.\n\n====Lizardmen====\n{{Nihongo|Lizardmen|\u30ea\u30b6\u30fc\u30c9\u30de\u30f3|Riz\u0101doman}} are humanoid lizards that have shared human and reptilian characteristics. They live in a tribal-like society with there currently being five known tribes: Green Claw, Small Fang, Razor Tail, Dragon Tusk and Red eye.\n\nNazarick declared war on the Lizardmen in order to solidify their control over the region. In response, the tribes formed an alliance, but were defeated. Fortunately, Cocytus came to respect the Lizardmen and requested Ainz to show them mercy, causing him to place them under his supervision. Afterwards, the Lizardmen came to revere Ainz as a god.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Zaryusu Shasha|\u30b6\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u30fb\u30b7\u30e3\u30b7\u30e3|Zary\u016bsu Shasha}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiroki Touchi]]|[[Josh Bangle]]<ref>https://www.funimation.com/shows/overlord/</ref>}}\n:A Lizardman of Green Claw and younger brother of Shasryu.

Unable to bear the shame, Cursch, arranged an uprising, which was successful, passing the mantle of chief to her. She and Zaryusu meet when he comes to ask for an alliance between Lizardmen, and they fall in love, when he, while infatuated by her beauty, lets out a mating cry for her. They eventually become closer and marry and even have a son, who is an albino. She becomes a representative for the Lizard people, after the fight against Cocytus. She meets Ainz, talking to him in fear and respect, and he offers to bring back Zaryusu in return for her acting as an informant to him, for any sign of rebellion. She is the most powerful magic caster among the lizardmen, but due to her skin, she is extremely vulnerable to the sun, making her wear a ridiculous bush outfit whenever she goes out in the day. She is still fearful of Ainz, as when he inquires about the child she fears he might take him away.\n\n=====Dragon Tusk=====\n{{Nihongo|Dragon Tusk|\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30fb\u30bf\u30b9\u30af|Doragon Tasuku}} is one of the five Lizardman tribes.

However, his scheme was seen through and he was forced to travel to the tomb to apologize to Ainz. Upon seeing the power of Nazarick, he proposed an alliance to prevent them from attacking the Empire. He planned on forming an alliance with the other human nations against Nazarick, but they abandoned him. Afterwards, the Emperor gave up and submitted to Ainz.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Fluder Paradyne|\u30d5\u30fc\u30eb\u30fc\u30c0\u30fb\u30d1\u30e9\u30c0\u30a4\u30f3|F\u016br\u016bda Paradain}}\n:{{voiced by|Takaya Hashi|Kenny Green}}\n:The imperial court wizard of the Empire and one of the strongest Magic casters in the New World.

To this end, he waged war against the Dwarfs and forged an alliance with the Frost Dragons. However, this 'alliance' was little more than the Quagoa being the Frost Dragons' servants, causing the king to conspire against them. When Aura and Shalltear appeared before him and told him to surrender, the king was too stunted by the seemingly ridiculous demand to answer. As a result, he had to watch as the pair massacred his brethren.

In response to this, the king created a new title just for him: 'Warrior Captain', and gave him his own 'Warrior Troop' to command. He first met Ainz while investigating the destruction of several villages and came to greatly respect him due to him saving Carne Village. Unfortunately, they later became enemies when the Kingdom and Nazarick went to war with each other. He challenged Ainz to a one-on-one duel where the latter reluctantly killed him. Before his death, he wished not to be resurrected should he lose, so Ainz honored his wish by casting a spell on him that invalidates resurrection.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Brain Unglaus|\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30a2\u30f3\u30b0\u30e9\u30a6\u30b9|Burein Angurausu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Koji Yusa]] (anime)|Chad Halbrook}}\n:A warrior turned mercenary who sees himself as Gazef's rival.

He regains his will when he sees Climb withstand the intense killing intent from Sebas, understanding that humans can still change and become stronger.

He and his Scripture were hired by some corrupt nobles from the Re-Estize to assassinate Gazef Stronoff and would have succeeded if not for Ainz, who effortlessly defeated him. He was then taken captive and is tortured to death by Demiurge.\n\n=====Black Scripture=====\nThe {{Nihongo|Black Scripture|\u3057\u3063\u3053\u304f\u305b\u3044\u3066\u3093|Shikkoku Seiten}} is one of the Six Scriptures of the Slane Theocracy.

She greatly admired her mother, who was a Paladin, and thus aspires to be one herself. However, she lacked her mother's talent and was ironically gifted with her father's archery skills instead. She also inherited her father's dark, glaring eyes that often give others a wrong impression of her. Upon meeting Ainz, she became infatuated by his belief that strength is required to protect others and she later becomes his guard after he agrees to aid the Holy Kingdom. During her service to him, Ainz lent her high-level equipment, causing her to be central in liberating the Northern Holy Kingdom.

Having ended the previous season as [[FA Cup]] [[2001 FA Cup Final|finalists]] and league runners-up to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], the club went one better in this campaign, by completing the [[Double (association football)|domestic double]] \u2013 their second in four years and third overall. Arsenal won the [[Premier League]] by a seven-point margin, were unbeaten away from home and managed the unique feat of scoring in every league game. They lost only three times in the division, all of which at home. At the [[Millennium Stadium]], Arsenal beat [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] 2\u20130 to win the [[2002 FA Cup Final]]. In Europe however, they fared poorly as they were eliminated in the second group stage of the [[UEFA Champions League]].\n\nIn the [[transfer window]], Arsenal sold several fringe players, notably [[Nelson Vivas]] to [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] and [[Sylvinho]] to [[Celta de Vigo|Celta Vigo]]; goalkeeper [[John Lukic]] was released following his decision to retire. Goalkeeper [[Richard Wright (footballer)|Richard Wright]] was signed as an earmarked understudy to [[David Seaman]], while midfielder [[Giovanni van Bronckhorst]] and striker [[Francis Jeffers]] were purchased in big money moves from [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] respectively. Perhaps the marked signing for Arsenal was the acquisition of defender [[Sol Campbell]], who moved from local rivals [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on a [[Free transfer (association football)|free transfer]].\n\nManager [[Ars\u00e8ne Wenger]] was named [[Premier League Manager of the Season|Barclaycard Manager of the Year]] and midfielder [[Freddie Ljungberg]] received the player equivalent \u2013 the [[Premier League Player of the Season|Barclaycard Player of the Year]], in recognition of the team's achievement. Winger [[Robert Pires]] was given the accolade of being the [[Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year]], while [[Thierry Henry]] ended the campaign as club and the league's top goalscorer, the latter for which he was awarded the [[Premier League Golden Boot]]. At the end of the season, club captain [[Tony Adams]] announced his retirement from football; he was followed by fellow defender [[Lee Dixon]] and club goalkeeping coach [[Bob Wilson (footballer, born 1941)|Bob Wilson]].\n\n{{TOClimit|limit=3}}\n\n==Background==\n{{see also|2000\u201301 Arsenal F.C. season}}\nIn the 2000\u201301 season, Arsenal finished second in the Premier League for the third consecutive season \u2013 this time ten points behind Manchester United.

Having ended the previous season as [[FA Cup]] [[2001 FA Cup Final|finalists]] and league runners-up to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], the club went one better in this campaign, by completing the [[Double (association football)|domestic double]] \u2013 their second in four years and third overall. Arsenal won the [[Premier League]] by a seven-point margin, were unbeaten away from home and managed the unique feat of scoring in every league game. They lost only three times in the division, all of which at home. At the [[Millennium Stadium]], Arsenal beat [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] 2\u20130 to win the [[2002 FA Cup Final]]. In Europe however, they fared poorly as they were eliminated in the second group stage of the [[UEFA Champions League]].\n\nIn the [[transfer window]], Arsenal sold several fringe players, notably [[Nelson Vivas]] to [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] and [[Sylvinho]] to [[Celta de Vigo|Celta Vigo]]; goalkeeper [[John Lukic]] was released following his decision to retire. Goalkeeper [[Richard Wright (footballer)|Richard Wright]] was signed as an earmarked understudy to [[David Seaman]], while midfielder [[Giovanni van Bronckhorst]] and striker [[Francis Jeffers]] were purchased in big money moves from [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] respectively. Perhaps the marked signing for Arsenal was the acquisition of defender [[Sol Campbell]], who moved from local rivals [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on a [[Free transfer (association football)|free transfer]].\n\nManager [[Ars\u00e8ne Wenger]] was named [[Premier League Manager of the Season|Barclaycard Manager of the Year]] and midfielder [[Freddie Ljungberg]] received the player equivalent \u2013 the [[Premier League Player of the Season|Barclaycard Player of the Year]], in recognition of the team's achievement. Winger [[Robert Pires]] was given the accolade of being the [[Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year]], while [[Thierry Henry]] ended the campaign as club and the league's top goalscorer, the latter for which he was awarded the [[Premier League Golden Boot]].

Murrow]] and [[Fred W. Friendly]]. He died from fuel gas inhalation as it was discovered that his [[stove]] and [[oven]] had been turned on but not lit (allowing gas to fill his apartment). Consequently, Hollenbeck's death was ruled a [[suicide]]. Reasons that it might have been suicide included health problems, depression, a broken marriage, and frequent published attacks by [[Jack O'Brian]], a [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst]] columnist and supporter of [[Joseph McCarthy]].\n\n==Background==\nDonald Hollenbeck was born in [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]], [[Nebraska]], and began reporting the news while at the [[University of Nebraska]]. \n\n==Career==\n\nHollenbeck's first assignment was to the ''[[Nebraska State Journal]]'' in 1926. During [[World War II]], he was assigned to the foreign staff of [[NBC]] in London in March 1943. From there he went to [[Algiers]] just in time to take a place with the British troops landing at [[Salerno]], [[Italy]] in September. He went in with the second wave\u2014the assault wave which took the full force of German shells, and later made a number of battle-action recordings which were broadcast to the United States.\n\nDuring the conquest of southern Italy, Hollenbeck moved northward with the troops and was one of the first correspondents to begin broadcasting from [[Naples]] when the [[Army Signal Corps]] set up transmitters for the correspondents. But at [[Salerno]] he was stricken with [[malaria]], then with [[jaundice]] and ordered back home:     <blockquote> <small> The first big event for me in covering the news over there was at Salerno, just south of the town. I'll never forget it! We were on a headquarters ship and had put the commanding officer ashore, then for a while feared we couldn't get the rest of the people off. We were under heavy fire, so had to back off and spend that morning shuttling back and forth in the bay with German aircraft overhead and German '88' guns on shore, and behind us our own destroyers and cruisers bombarding the shore positions, so it was not a very pleasant cruise we had around the gulf of Salerno... I had a wire recorder with me and was on top of the landing craft trying to make some records at the time.{{cite source|date=March 2020}} </small> </blockquote>     Asked what kind of protection there was after these forces had landed, Hollenbeck replied:     <blockquote> <small> You hope there is air cover. We had difficulty that way because our forces were based in [[Sicily]]. They had to fly all the way, and it didn't give them very much gas to spend over our heads. We looked for those planes most of the time.{{cite source|date=March 2020}} </small> </blockquote>     From ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' September 20, 1943:     <blockquote> <small> Don Hollenbeck of NBC sent back from Italy one of the most dramatic recordings we've ever heard. Against a backdrop of gunfire Don gave a vivid description of the bitter battle raging about him as he stood on the shore with microphone in hand and a portable recorder on his back. Interviews with the boys engaged in the fight were outstanding. <br> A [[Wire recording|wire recorder]] was used for this broadcast from the beach at Salerno. On the hair-fine thread of steel wound on that small spool every sound of battle was inscribed, then relayed to [[Algiers]] and [[short-wave radio|short-waved]] to the United States on September 17. In such fashion history is chronicled today with complete fidelity even while in the making, and that in itself is history.{{cite source|date=March 2020}} </small> </blockquote>     \n=== Allegations regarding communism ===\nHollenbeck was at one time employed by the newspaper ''[[PM (newspaper)|PM]]''.  Founded in 1940 by department store magnate [[Marshall Field III]] and published in New York, ''PM'' was a left-leaning newspaper, and it garnered accusations of being sympathetic to [[Communism]] even though it was critical of the [[Soviet Union]] for the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] and of the [[Communist Party, USA|American Communist Party]] for supporting it.\n\nThe newspaper published work by authors such as [[Ernest Hemingway]] and [[Erskine Caldwell]], photographers like [[Weegee]] and [[Margaret Bourke-White]], and cartoonists like [[Dr. Seuss]], [[Crockett Johnson]] and [[Walt Kelly]]. It accepted no advertising, and dedicated itself to preventing \"the little guy from being pushed around.\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} It ended up becoming a target for [[anti-communism|anti-communists]], and subsequently it went out of business in 1948. Because of this affiliation, Hollenbeck was a target for [[Joseph McCarthy|McCarthy]]-supporting columnist [[Jack O'Brian]], whose attacks appeared in the ''[[New York Journal American]]'' and other newspapers in the [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst]] newspaper chain.\n\nHollenbeck also worked for the [[Office of War Information]] (OWI), [[NBC]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], once subbing on short notice for [[Orson Welles]] over Welles' scheduled Sunday [[Orson Welles Commentaries|ABC news commentary program]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Hollenbeck|first=Don|title=Orson Welles Commentary, July 21, 1946|url=https://archive.org/download/1946OrsonWellesCommentaries/460721_OPA_One_Year_Extension.MP3}}</ref> before joining [[CBS]] in 1946. \n\nMurrow had Hollenbeck work on the innovative media-review program, ''CBS Views the Press,'' over the radio network's flagship station, [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]].  Hollenbeck discussed [[Edward U. Condon]], [[Alger Hiss]], and [[Paul Robeson]].<ref name=Ghiglione>\n{{cite book\n| first = Loren\n| last = Ghiglione\n| authorlink = Loren Ghiglione\n| title = CBS's Don Hollenbeck: An Honest Reporter in the Age of McCarthyism\n| publisher = Columbia University Press\n| lay-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8OKOd9Ae1JsC\n| pages = 146-147 (Condon), 147 (Counterattack), 148-149 (Hiss), 149-150 (Robeson), 220-223 (suicide)\n| date = 2008\n| accessdate = 10 September 2015\n| url = https://archive.org/details/cbssdonhollenbec0000ghig| url-access = registration\n| quote = Hiss Chambers.\n| isbn = 9780231516891}}</ref>  \n* Regarding Condon, Hollenbeck critiqued anti-communists for going about their business the wrong way:  <blockquote> <small> Communists want nothing more than to be lumped with freedom-loving non-Communists...  This simply makes it easer for them to conceal their true nature, and to allege that the term 'Communist' is meaningless...  At the same time, we cannot let abuses deter us from the legitimate exposing of real Communists.<ref name=Ghiglione/> </small> </blockquote>  (Here, Hollenbeck was placing Condon in the \"freedom-loving non-Communist\" camp.)  \n* Regarding Hiss (during which case, as [[Loren Ghiglione]] has noted \"Hollenbeck and his coverage of the reporting of the Hiss-[[Whittaker Chambers|Chambers]] case did not take sides on Hiss's guilt or innocence\"<ref name=Ghiglione/>), Hollenbeck criticized press coverage.  For instance, he noted how a ''[[New York Journal-American]]'' story led a story stating \"The government ended its cross-examination of Alger Hiss at 3:01 p.m. today after forcing him to admit he was an associate of Mrs. [[Carol Weiss King|Carol King]], prominent legal defender of Communists, and a friend of [[Nathan Witt]], ex-[[New Deal]] lawyer who was fired because of his Communist activities.\"  Hollenbeck noted that the transcript differed greatly, in that Hiss had said:  he had met King \"once or twice,\" while his description of when and where he met Witt even less clear.  He also noted the [[guilt by association]] tactics of fellow journalists, for example, [[Westbrook Pegler]], who sought to discredit [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] through link to Hiss via [[Felix Frankfurter]].<ref name=Ghiglione/>  \n* Regarding Robeson and the [[Peekskill riots]] of 27 August 1949, Hollenbeck said that, while most newspapers had covered the riots well, the ''[[New York World-Telegram]]'' had drawn from sources that disliked Robeson, including ''[[The Compass]]'' (successor to ''PM'', Hollenbeck's former employer).<ref name=Ghiglione/>\n\nIn the early 1950s, Hollenbeck worked both for CBS Television and flagship [[WCBS-TV]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/18/arts/television/18holl.html?_r=0|title=Remembering a Forgotten Newsman |author=Elizabeth Jensen|date= October 17, 2008|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\n\nThe first newsman WCBS-TV viewers saw after Murrow's March 9, 1954, documentary on Joe McCarthy was Hollenbeck, who told the viewers he wanted \"to associate myself with what Ed Murrow has just said, and say I have never been prouder of CBS.\" That prompted O'Brian in the Hearst newspapers (including the flagship ''Journal-American'') to step up his criticism of CBS and especially of Hollenbeck, who, despite his news experience under pressure situations, was a sensitive man.\n\nOn June 22, 1954, the 49-year-old Hollenbeck committed [[suicide]] by [[natural gas|gas]] in his [[Manhattan]] apartment.<ref name=Ghiglione/> A newspaper account reported:    <blockquote> <small> He had been in ill health. Clad in shorts and bathrobe, he was found lying on the kitchen floor. All burners on the gas stove were open. The assistant [[medical examiner]] pronounced the death a suicide. Hollenbeck's agent said he had been suffering from a bleeding ulcer. Hollenbeck\u2019s body was discovered at about 11 a.m. after another tenant smelled gas and notified management. Hollenbeck lived alone. His wife, Angelique, maintained a separate residence with the couple's daughter, Zoe, 9. They were married in 1941.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} </small> </blockquote>    \n==Legacy==\n[[File:Hollenbeck.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ray Wise]] as Don Hollenbeck in ''[[Good Night, and Good Luck]]''.]]\nIn the 1976 film [[Network (1976 film)|''Network'']] after being fired as President of the news division in the  fictional UBS network, Max Schumacher ([[William Holden]]) is packing his belongings and finds an old picture taken when he and Howard Beale ([[Peter Finch]]) worked at CBS and notes that Hollenbeck is in the picture.\n\nIn 1986, Hollenbeck was played by Harry Ditson in the HBO original production ''[[Murrow (film)|Murrow]]''. \n\nIn 2005, Hollenbeck was later played by [[Ray Wise]] in the film ''[[Good Night, and Good Luck]]'', which was centered on Murrow and [[CBS News]] in their 1950s campaign against McCarthy. One of the film's sub-plots included Hollenbeck's suicide following continued printed attacks by Jack O'Brian. He was portrayed through the film as a broken man, as a result of his wife leaving him and the allegations by O'Brian that he was a \"[[pinko]]\" communist-sympathizer who deliberately biased his news reports. The movie shows Hollenbeck's suicide closely following Edward Murrow's April rebuttal to McCarthy, but the two events were in reality separated by two months; in the film's commentary track on the DVD release, director [[George Clooney]] said that this was done for dramatic reasons.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb name|id=0390944}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120225041846/http://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/product/Radios-Revolution,673991.aspx Radio's Revolution: Don Hollenbeck's CBS Views the Press] edited and with an introduction by [[Loren Ghiglione]] (University of Nebraska Press, 2008)\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=GSieyqygeOsC CBS\u2019s Don Hollenbeck: An Honest Reporter in the Age of McCarthyism]\n\n* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/78541842@N07/7512793634/in/set-72157630445053202 Bill Leonard remembers Don Hollenbeck (June 23, 1954)]\n* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/78541842@N07/7512770794/in/set-72157630445053202 New York Times obituary]\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/18/arts/television/18holl.html?_r=0 Remembering a Forgotten Newsman NY Times.

On the hair-fine thread of steel wound on that small spool every sound of battle was inscribed, then relayed to [[Algiers]] and [[short-wave radio|short-waved]] to the United States on September 17. In such fashion history is chronicled today with complete fidelity even while in the making, and that in itself is history.{{cite source|date=March 2020}} </small> </blockquote>     \n=== Allegations regarding communism ===\nHollenbeck was at one time employed by the newspaper [[PM (newspaper)|PM]].  Founded in 1940 by department store magnate [[Marshall Field III]] and published in New York, ''PM'' was a left-leaning newspaper, and it garnered accusations of being sympathetic to [[Communism]] even though it was critical of the [[Soviet Union]] for the [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] and of the [[Communist Party, USA|American Communist Party]] for supporting it.\n\nThe newspaper published work by authors such as [[Ernest Hemingway]] and [[Erskine Caldwell]], photographers like [[Weegee]] and [[Margaret Bourke-White]], and cartoonists like [[Dr. Seuss]], [[Crockett Johnson]] and [[Walt Kelly]]. It accepted no advertising, and dedicated itself to preventing \"the little guy from being pushed around.\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} It ended up becoming a target for [[anti-communism|anti-communists]], and subsequently it went out of business in 1948. Because of this affiliation, Hollenbeck was a target for [[Joseph McCarthy|McCarthy]]-supporting columnist [[Jack O'Brian]], whose attacks appeared in the ''[[New York Journal American]]'' and other newspapers in the [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst]] newspaper chain.\n\nHollenbeck also worked for the [[Office of War Information]] (OWI), [[NBC]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], once subbing on short notice for [[Orson Welles]] over Welles' scheduled Sunday [[Orson Welles Commentaries|ABC news commentary program]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Hollenbeck|first=Don|title=Orson Welles Commentary, July 21, 1946|url=https://archive.org/download/1946OrsonWellesCommentaries/460721_OPA_One_Year_Extension.MP3}}</ref> before joining [[CBS]] in 1946. \n\nMurrow had Hollenbeck work on the innovative media-review program, ''CBS Views the Press,'' over the radio network's flagship station, [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]].  Hollenbeck discussed [[Edward U. Condon]], [[Alger Hiss]], and [[Paul Robeson]].<ref name=Ghiglione>\n{{cite book\n| first = Loren\n| last = Ghiglione\n| authorlink = Loren Ghiglione\n| title = CBS's Don Hollenbeck: An Honest Reporter in the Age of McCarthyism\n| publisher = Columbia University Press\n| lay-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8OKOd9Ae1JsC\n| pages = 146-147 (Condon), 147 (Counterattack), 148-149 (Hiss), 149-150 (Robeson), 220-223 (suicide)\n| date = 2008\n| accessdate = 10 September 2015\n| url = https://archive.org/details/cbssdonhollenbec0000ghig| url-access = registration\n| quote = Hiss Chambers.\n| isbn = 9780231516891}}</ref>  \n* Regarding Condon, Hollenbeck critiqued anti-communists for going about their business the wrong way:  <blockquote> <small> Communists want nothing more than to be lumped with freedom-loving non-Communists...  This simply makes it easer for them to conceal their true nature, and to allege that the term 'Communist' is meaningless...  At the same time, we cannot let abuses deter us from the legitimate exposing of real Communists.<ref name=Ghiglione/> </small> </blockquote>  (Here, Hollenbeck was placing Condon in the \"freedom-loving non-Communist\" camp.)  \n* Regarding Hiss (during which case, as [[Loren Ghiglione]] has noted \"Hollenbeck and his coverage of the reporting of the Hiss-[[Whittaker Chambers|Chambers]] case did not take sides on Hiss's guilt or innocence\"<ref name=Ghiglione/>), Hollenbeck criticized press coverage.  For instance, he noted how a ''[[New York Journal-American]]'' story led a story stating \"The government ended its cross-examination of Alger Hiss at 3:01 p.m. today after forcing him to admit he was an associate of Mrs. [[Carol Weiss King|Carol King]], prominent legal defender of Communists, and a friend of [[Nathan Witt]], ex-[[New Deal]] lawyer who was fired because of his Communist activities.\"  Hollenbeck noted that the transcript differed greatly, in that Hiss had said:  he had met King \"once or twice,\" while his description of when and where he met Witt even less clear.  He also noted the [[guilt by association]] tactics of fellow journalists, for example, [[Westbrook Pegler]], who sought to discredit [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] through link to Hiss via [[Felix Frankfurter]].<ref name=Ghiglione/>  \n* Regarding Robeson and the [[Peekskill riots]] of 27 August 1949, Hollenbeck said that, while most newspapers had covered the riots well, the ''[[New York World-Telegram]]'' had drawn from sources that disliked Robeson, including ''[[The Compass]]'' (successor to ''PM'', Hollenbeck's former employer).<ref name=Ghiglione/>\n\nIn the early 1950s, Hollenbeck worked both for CBS Television and flagship [[WCBS-TV]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/18/arts/television/18holl.html?_r=0|title=Remembering a Forgotten Newsman |author=Elizabeth Jensen|date= October 17, 2008|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\n\nThe first newsman WCBS-TV viewers saw after Murrow's March 9, 1954, documentary on Joe McCarthy was Hollenbeck, who told the viewers he wanted \"to associate myself with what Ed Murrow has just said, and say I have never been prouder of CBS.\" That prompted O'Brian in the Hearst newspapers (including the flagship ''Journal-American'') to step up his criticism of CBS and especially of Hollenbeck, who, despite his news experience under pressure situations, was a sensitive man.\n\nOn June 22, 1954, the 49-year-old Hollenbeck committed [[suicide]] by [[natural gas|gas]] in his [[Manhattan]] apartment.<ref name=Ghiglione/> A newspaper account reported:    <blockquote> <small> He had been in ill health. Clad in shorts and bathrobe, he was found lying on the kitchen floor. All burners on the gas stove were open. The assistant [[medical examiner]] pronounced the death a suicide. Hollenbeck's agent said he had been suffering from a bleeding ulcer. Hollenbeck\u2019s body was discovered at about 11 a.m. after another tenant smelled gas and notified management. Hollenbeck lived alone. His wife, Angelique, maintained a separate residence with the couple's daughter, Zoe, 9. They were married in 1941.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} </small> </blockquote>    \n==Legacy==\n[[File:Hollenbeck.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ray Wise]] as Don Hollenbeck in ''[[Good Night, and Good Luck]]''.]]\nIn the 1976 film [[Network (1976 film)|''Network'']] after being fired as President of the news division in the  fictional UBS network, Max Schumacher ([[William Holden]]) is packing his belongings and finds an old picture taken when he and Howard Beale ([[Peter Finch]]) worked at CBS and notes that Hollenbeck is in the picture.\n\nIn 1986, Hollenbeck was played by Harry Ditson in the HBO original production ''[[Murrow (film)|Murrow]]''. \n\nIn 2005, Hollenbeck was later played by [[Ray Wise]] in the film ''[[Good Night, and Good Luck]]'', which was centered on Murrow and [[CBS News]] in their 1950s campaign against McCarthy. One of the film's sub-plots included Hollenbeck's suicide following continued printed attacks by Jack O'Brian. He was portrayed through the film as a broken man, as a result of his wife leaving him and the allegations by O'Brian that he was a \"[[pinko]]\" communist-sympathizer who deliberately biased his news reports. The movie shows Hollenbeck's suicide closely following Edward Murrow's April rebuttal to McCarthy, but the two events were in reality separated by two months; in the film's commentary track on the DVD release, director [[George Clooney]] said that this was done for dramatic reasons.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb name|id=0390944}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120225041846/http://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/product/Radios-Revolution,673991.aspx Radio's Revolution: Don Hollenbeck's CBS Views the Press] edited and with an introduction by [[Loren Ghiglione]] (University of Nebraska Press, 2008)\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=GSieyqygeOsC CBS\u2019s Don Hollenbeck: An Honest Reporter in the Age of McCarthyism]\n\n* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/78541842@N07/7512793634/in/set-72157630445053202 Bill Leonard remembers Don Hollenbeck (June 23, 1954)]\n* [https://www.flickr.com/photos/78541842@N07/7512770794/in/set-72157630445053202 New York Times obituary]\n* [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/18/arts/television/18holl.html?_r=0 Remembering a Forgotten Newsman NY Times.

Arguably, this was the pinnacle of [[Carlo Ancelotti]]'s Milan side, as the players proved they had the ability to perform effectively for the whole season.\n\n[[A.S. Roma|Roma]] both scored more and conceded fewer goals than Milan, but the effectiveness the Milanese showed in tight matches ensured their winning margin was edged out to a stable 11 points. The title was sealed against Roma at home, with a goal by [[Andriy Shevchenko]] proving enough for a 1\u20130 win.\n\nIn the [[2003\u201304 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], Milan failed to defend their European title, as they were knocked out in the quarter-finals, losing 4\u20130 to [[Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a|Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a]] in the second leg, after they had won 4\u20131 at home.\n\nIndividually, the biggest surprise was how the Brazilian [[trequartista]] [[Kak\u00e1]] seamlessly found his way into the Italian game, being a key player in Milan's success. The other two arrivals, [[Cafu]] and [[Giuseppe Pancaro]], also integrated well with the team. [[Andriy Shevchenko]] was crowned as [[Ballon d'Or|European Footballer of the Year]] on the back of his successful season. Tactically, Ancelotti used two different formations throughout the season; the [[Formation (association football)#4\u20134\u20132 diamond or 4\u20131\u20132\u20131\u20132|4\u20134\u20132 diamond]] (or 4\u20131\u20132\u20131\u20132) and the [[Formation (association football)#4\u20133\u20132\u20131 (the \"Christmas Tree\" formation)|4\u20133\u20132\u20131]].\n==Players==\n\n===Squad information===\n:''Squad at end of season''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballsquads.co.uk/italy/2003-2004/seriea/milan.htm|title=FootballSquads - Milan - 2003/04|website=www.footballsquads.co.uk}}</ref>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;

Roma|Roma]] both scored more and conceded fewer goals than Milan, but the effectiveness the Milanese showed in tight matches ensured their winning margin was edged out to a stable 11 points. The title was sealed against Roma at home, with a goal by [[Andriy Shevchenko]] proving enough for a 1\u20130 win.\n\nIn the [[2003\u201304 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], Milan failed to defend their European title, as they were knocked out in the quarter-finals, losing 4\u20130 to [[Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a|Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a]] in the second leg, after they had won 4\u20131 at home.\n\nIndividually, the biggest surprise was how the Brazilian [[trequartista]] [[Kak\u00e1]] seamlessly found his way into the Italian game, being a key player in Milan's success. The other two arrivals, [[Cafu]] and [[Giuseppe Pancaro]], also integrated well with the team. [[Andriy Shevchenko]] was crowned as [[Ballon d'Or|European Footballer of the Year]] on the back of his successful season. Tactically, Ancelotti used two different formations throughout the season; the [[Formation (association football)#4\u20134\u20132 diamond or 4\u20131\u20132\u20131\u20132|4\u20134\u20132 diamond]] (or 4\u20131\u20132\u20131\u20132) and the [[Formation (association football)#4\u20133\u20132\u20131 (the \"Christmas Tree\" formation)|4\u20133\u20132\u20131]].\n==Players==\n\n===Squad information===\n:''Squad at end of season''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballsquads.co.uk/italy/2003-2004/seriea/milan.htm|title=FootballSquads - Milan - 2003/04|website=www.footballsquads.co.uk}}</ref>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;

The series is based on the [[Walks Around Britain|website]] of the same name and is an integral part of the brand. The series is designed to inspire more viewers to get outside and go walking, and as such features a wide range of routes, but mainly ones which most viewers can actually get out and do.\n\nA second series started on May 2016, a third in early 2017 and a fourth in mid-2018. A fifth series was aired in 2018/2019, and the sixth will form part of the exclusive content produced for the ''Walks Around Britain+'' video on-demand subscription website<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.prolificnorth.co.uk/news/broadcasting/2019/02/walks-around-britain-launches-subscription-offering|title=Walks Around Britain launches subscription offering|publisher=Prolific North |date=7 February 2019}}</ref> before being broadcast on linear television.\n\nThe series differs from many other programmes about walking as it rarely leaves the walking route at all. This is due to lead presenter and producer [[Andrew White (presenter & writer)|Andrew White]] being fed up with programmes being seemingly about walking, but where the presenter leaves the walk to undertake ghyll scrambling or [[coasteering]]. He devised a format guide for the series, with six rules which all the programmes would follow, including \"the walk is the star\" and \"we never do anything a regular walker couldn't\" \u2013 meaning the presenters don't get an all-access pass to places just because they are on television.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/AndrewRWhite/status/1106597356722704387|title=Tweet from Andrew White's account|date=15 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe series is also different in being based on a [[first-run syndication]] model \u2013 more commonly used in the [[United States]]. The relaxing of the rules from the regulator [[Ofcom]] in 2011 allows ''Walks Around Britain'' to be funded by [[PP icon|product placement]], with companies ranging from outdoor clothing manufacturers to rail companies paying to be inside the programmes. Once produced, the programmes are licensed to a range of broadcasters in the UK and around the world.  Currently, the series is broadcast on 20 channels in the UK, and because dates and times of showings are decided by the individual television stations, it is possible to find the same edition of ''Walks Around Britain'' showing on two different channels at the same time.\n\nIt covers various subjects relating to both the natural and social history of the walks featured in the programme, and as with the website, the TV series includes walks on the [[Crown Dependencies]] of the [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Channel Islands]].\n\nIn December 2016, the first reversion of the series format, ''The Great Glen Way \u2013 A Walks Around Britain Special'', was screened on Community Channel. This took the established format and expanded it to cover one [[Long-distance footpaths in the United Kingdom|long-distance walking trail]] \u2013 The [[Great Glen Way]] between [[Fort William, Highland|Fort William]] and [[Inverness]]. The usual 22-minute format was expanded to 44 minutes to fit into an hour time slot. Community Channel premiered it at Christmas 2016, with the other broadcasters following afterwards. This led to the idea of producing regular specials featuring some of the other shorter long-distance trails, which often don't get a lot of publicity.\n\n==Presenters==\n\nThe presenters, and the series they have appeared in, are:\n*[[Andrew White (presenter & writer)|Andrew White]] (lead presenter, series 1-)\n*Leah Hather (presenter, series 1\u20133, 5-)\n*Claire Maxted (presenter, series 5)\n*Zoe Dawes (presenter, series 2)\n*Alannah White (presenter, series 2\u20134, 6-)\n*Olivia White (presenter, series 3\u20134, 6-)\n*Vikkie Lee (presenter, series 6-)\n*[[Alan Hinkes]] (presenter, series 6-)\n\n==Series overview==\n\nIn the main series, each programme lasts 22 minutes and features two walks between 2 and 8 miles \u2013 one walk in part one and one in part two. Usually there is a geographical spread between the two in one programme, but on two occasions so far, a specific area was featured as a \"special\" \u2013 most notably in series 3 when two walks on the island of [[Jersey]] formed a programme. The walks in an episode are sometimes linked with a theme \u2013 as in series 4 with two walks in [[Yorkshire]] from railway stations.\n\nUnlike similar series, ''Walks Around Britain'' doesn't concentrate on \"walks with a view\", but instead aims to tell ''stories''. So, a walk in the programme could well have any elements of [[British heritage]], [[social history]] and the [[natural environment]], but could just as well include [[physical health]], [[mental health]], [[wellbeing]], [[engineering]], [[archaeology]], [[popular history]] and [[biological anthropology]]. In that way, the series is more akin to [[BBC Two]]'s [[Coast (TV series)|Coast]], than other walking series.\n\nAgain, like Coast, the series features one lead presenter \u2013 currently Andrew White \u2013 who introduces the walks and links the programme together. The walks are then either presented by White, or by one of the other regular ''Walks Around Britain'' presenters. This was designed to ensure the series' longevity if and when presenters want to move on. To date, White has presented at least one walk in every edition.  \n\nThe series is designed to encourage and inspire viewers to get outside and do the walks for themselves \u2013 so the programmes feature animated maps showing the walking route and on-screen graphics with information about the length, type and time it would on average take to do the walk. It also features the starting point as a [[grid reference]] and lists the relevant [[Ordnance Survey]] map which would be needed for the walk. Each of the walks have a dedicated page on the [[Walks Around Britain]] website with more detailed information.\n\n''Walks Around Britain'' is currently the only walking series in Britain to regularly feature children, as White's own daughters, Alannah and Olivia are often go the walks. It is also the only mainstream walking series to feature [[dogs]] \u2013 as White's own four [[border collies]] frequently go on the walks.\n\nAlthough broadcasters are encouraged to show the programmes in order, the programmes are designed to be \"stand alone\", so there isn't any mention of what walks are coming up on the next episode.\n\nAll the series have been filmed and edited in [[high-definition television|high-definition]], but have never been transmitted on any broadcast channel in this format as all the broadcasters who show the series are standard-definition only. The series is available in high-definition on [[Amazon Prime Video]] and ''Walks Around Britain+'' - the series own video on-demand subscription website, with a selection of editions available free in high-definition on the ''Walks Around Britain'' YouTube channel.\n\n===Series 1 (2016)===\n\nThe first series of ''Walks Around Britain'' was originally aired on [[Together (TV channel)|Community Channel]] during the winter and spring of 2016. It has subsequently been broadcast on 22 channels in the UK.\n\nThe series visited Scotland twice, Wales once and the most southerly walk was on the north coast of Cornwall. Two walks on the Isle of Man also featured.\n\nThe part lengths for series 1 vary considerably as most of the walks were remastered from the original ''Walks Around Britain'' YouTube channel. This led to programmes in series 1 being edited to fit a 22-minute time slot when they were broadcast on [[Local Television Limited|Made Television network]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#389cff;\"| Series<br />No.\n! style=\"background:#389cff;\"| Episode<br />No.\n! style=\"background:#389cff;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#389cff;\"| Directed by\n! style=\"background:#389cff;\"| Written by\n! style=\"background:#389cff;\"| Original Air Date\n\n{{Episode list/sublist|Walks Around Britain (TV series)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = [[Monsal Trail]] and [[Caledonian Canal]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2016|01|22}}\n |DirectedBy      = Andrew White\n |WrittenBy       = Andrew White\n |ShortSummary    = Andrew White walks on a disused railway in the [[Peak District]] and alongside the Caledonian Canal.\n |LineColor       = 389CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Walks Around Britain (TV series)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title           = [[Boscastle]] and [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2016|01|29}}\n |DirectedBy      = Andrew White\n |WrittenBy       = Andrew White\n |ShortSummary    = Andrew White walks along the coast at Boscastle, [[Cornwall]] and visits Ramsey on the [[Isle of Man]].\n |LineColor       = 389CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Walks Around Britain (TV series)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n |Title           = [[Ladybower Reservoir]] and [[Windermere]] \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2016|02|5}}\n |DirectedBy      = Andrew White\n |WrittenBy       = Andrew White\n |ShortSummary    = Andrew White walks above and alongside 2 large bodies of water - Ladybower Reservoir and Windermere.\n |LineColor       = 389CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Walks Around Britain (TV series)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n |Title           = The [[Great Orme]] and [[Haworth]] to [[Oakworth]] \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2016|02|12}}\n |DirectedBy      = Andrew White\n |WrittenBy       = Andrew White\n |ShortSummary    = Andrew White walks up The Great Orme in [[North Wales]] and besides a railway in [[West Yorkshire]].\n |LineColor       = 389CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Walks Around Britain (TV series)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n |Title           = [[Flamborough Head]] and [[Clumber Park]] \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2016|02|19}}\n |DirectedBy      = Dave Thorp & Andrew White\n |WrittenBy       = Andrew White\n |ShortSummary    = Andrew White walks along the cliffs at Flamborough Head and through Clumber Park, [[Nottinghamshire]].\n |LineColor       = 389CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Walks Around Britain (TV series)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n |Title           = The Coast of the Isle of Man and [[Sprotbrough]] \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2016|02|26}}\n |DirectedBy      = Andrew White\n |WrittenBy       = Andrew White\n |ShortSummary    = Andrew White walks along the Isle of Man's stunning coast and Leah Hather visits Sprotbrough in [[South Yorkshire]].\n |LineColor       = 389CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Walks Around Britain (TV series)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 7\n |Title           = [[Banavie]] to [[Gairlochy]] and the [[Ribblehead Viaduct]]. \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2016|03|04}}\n |DirectedBy      = Andrew White\n |WrittenBy       = Andrew White\n |ShortSummary    = Andrew White walks from Banavie to Gairlochy in the Scottish Highlands and around the Ribblehead Viaduct in the [[Yorkshire Dales]].\n |LineColor       = 389CFF\n}}\n|}\n\n===Series 2 (2016)===\n\nThe second series of ''Walks Around Britain'' was originally aired on Community Channel during the summer of 2016. It has subsequently been broadcast on 22 channels in the UK.\n\nThis series visited Scotland once, Wales once and included a walk on Jersey for the first time. To date, this series has the highest number of walks in a particular [[National parks of the United Kingdom|National Park]] \u2013 being in this instance the Lake District.\n\nThe part lengths and total running times for series 2 settled down to be a constant 11 minutes per part and 22 minutes in total, in order to fit into timeslots correctly when they were broadcast on [[Local Television Limited|Made Television network]]. That structure has continued throughout the series into the future.\n\nThe timescales between production and broadcast were so tight on series 2 that presenter Andrew White had to record a voice over for the Wolverhampton walk in programme 3 whilst suffering with a very bad throat, so the original Community Channel broadcast of programme 3 featured this croaky narration. When his vice recovered later, he re-recorded the voice over, and it is this version which is available now.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:silver;\"| Series<br />No.\n! style=\"background:silver;\"| Episode<br />No.\n! style=\"background:silver;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:silver;\"| Directed by\n! style=\"background:silver;\"| Written by\n! style=\"background:silver;\"| Original air date\n\n{{Episode list/sublist|Walks Around Britain (TV series)\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 1\n| Title               = [[Holmfirth]] and Wansfell Pike\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|df=yes|2016|5|27}}\n| DirectedBy          = Dave Thorp & Andrew White\n| WrittenBy           = Andrew White\n| ShortSummary        = Andrew White walks with artist [[Ashley Jackson (artist)|Ashley Jackson]] in Holmfirth and to the top of Wansfell Pike in the [[Lake District]].\n| LineColor           = C0C0C0\n| Viewers_2           = \n| OriginalAirDate_7   = \n| OriginalAirDate_8   = \n| OriginalAirDate_9   = \n| Viewers_1           = \n| Viewers_6           = \n| Viewers_3           = \n| Viewers_4           = \n| Viewers_5           = \n| OriginalAirDate_5   = \n| Viewers_7           = \n| Viewers_8           = \n| OriginalAirDate_6   = \n| Title_9             = \n| OriginalAirDate_4   = \n| OriginalAirDate_3   = \n| OriginalAirDate_2   = \n| OriginalAirDate_1   = \n| Title_8             = \n| Title_7             = \n| Title_6             = \n| Title_5             = \n| Title_4             = \n| Title_3             = \n| Title_2             = \n| Title_1             = \n| Viewers             = \n| Viewers_9           = \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Walks Around Britain (TV series)\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 2\n| Title               = [[Goole]] and [[Trentham Estate]]\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|df=yes|2016|6|3}}\n| DirectedBy          = Dave Thorp & Andrew White\n| WrittenBy           = Andrew White\n| ShortSummary        = Andrew White takes a surprising walk around Goole and through the Trentham Estate in [[Staffordshire]].\n| LineColor           = C0C0C0\n| Viewers_2           = \n| OriginalAirDate_7   = \n| OriginalAirDate_8   = \n| OriginalAirDate_9   = \n| Viewers_1           = \n| Viewers_6           = \n| Viewers_3           = \n| Viewers_4           = \n| Viewers_5           = \n| OriginalAirDate_5   = \n| Viewers_7           = \n| Viewers_8           = \n| OriginalAirDate_6   = \n| Title_9             = \n| OriginalAirDate_4   = \n| OriginalAirDate_3   = \n| OriginalAirDate_2   = \n| OriginalAirDate_1   = \n| Title_8             = \n| Title_7             = \n| Title_6             = \n| Title_5             = \n| Title_4             = \n| Title_3             = \n| Title_2             = \n| Title_1             = \n| Viewers             = \n| Viewers_9           = \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Walks Around Britain (TV series)\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 3\n| Title               = [[Wolverhampton]] Canal and [[Sour Howes]]\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|df=yes|2016|06|10}}\n| DirectedBy          = Andrew White\n| WrittenBy           = Andrew White\n| ShortSummary        = Andrew White walks alongside a canal in Wolverhampton and to the top of Sour Howes in the Lake District.\n| LineColor           = C0C0C0\n| Viewers_2           = \n| OriginalAirDate_7   = \n| OriginalAirDate_8   = \n| OriginalAirDate_9   = \n| Viewers_1           = \n| Viewers_6           = \n| Viewers_3           = \n| Viewers_4           = \n| Viewers_5           = \n| OriginalAirDate_5   = \n| Viewers_7           = \n| Viewers_8           = \n| OriginalAirDate_6   = \n| Title_9             = \n| OriginalAirDate_4   = \n| OriginalAirDate_3   = \n| OriginalAirDate_2   = \n| OriginalAirDate_1   = \n| Title_8             = \n| Title_7             = \n| Title_6             = \n| Title_5             = \n| Title_4             = \n| Title_3             = \n| Title_2             = \n| Title_1             = \n| Viewers             = \n| Viewers_9           = \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Walks Around Britain (TV series)\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 4\n| Title               = [[Brant Fell]] and [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]] to [[Rydal, Cumbria|Rydal]]\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|df=yes|2016|06|17}}\n| DirectedBy          = Andrew White\n| WrittenBy           = Andrew White\n| ShortSummary        = A Lake District Special -

The series is based on the [[Walks Around Britain|website]] of the same name and is an integral part of the brand. The series is designed to inspire more viewers to get outside and go walking, and as such features a wide range of routes, but mainly ones which most viewers can actually get out and do.\n\nA second series started on May 2016, a third in early 2017 and a fourth in mid-2018. A fifth series was aired in 2018/2019, and the sixth will form part of the exclusive content produced for the ''Walks Around Britain+'' video on-demand subscription website<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.prolificnorth.co.uk/news/broadcasting/2019/02/walks-around-britain-launches-subscription-offering|title=Walks Around Britain launches subscription offering|publisher=Prolific North |date=7 February 2019}}</ref> before being broadcast on linear television.\n\nThe series differs from many other programmes about walking as it rarely leaves the walking route at all. This is due to lead presenter and producer [[Andrew White (presenter & writer)|Andrew White]] being fed up with programmes being seemingly about walking, but where the presenter leaves the walk to undertake ghyll scrambling or [[coasteering]]. He devised a format guide for the series, with six rules which all the programmes would follow, including \"the walk is the star\" and \"we never do anything a regular walker couldn't\" \u2013 meaning the presenters don't get an all-access pass to places just because they are on television.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/AndrewRWhite/status/1106597356722704387|title=Tweet from Andrew White's account|date=15 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe series is also different in being based on a [[first-run syndication]] model \u2013 more commonly used in the [[United States]]. The relaxing of the rules from the regulator [[Ofcom]] in 2011 allows ''Walks Around Britain'' to be funded by [[PP icon|product placement]], with companies ranging from outdoor clothing manufacturers to rail companies paying to be inside the programmes. Once produced, the programmes are licensed to a range of broadcasters in the UK and around the world.  Currently, the series is broadcast on 20 channels in the UK, and because dates and times of showings are decided by the individual television stations, it is possible to find the same edition of ''Walks Around Britain'' showing on two different channels at the same time.\n\nIt covers various subjects relating to both the natural and social history of the walks featured in the programme, and as with the website, the TV series includes walks on the [[Crown Dependencies]] of the [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Channel Islands]].\n\nIn December 2016, the first reversion of the series format, ''The Great Glen Way \u2013 A Walks Around Britain Special'', was screened on Community Channel. This took the established format and expanded it to cover one [[Long-distance footpaths in the United Kingdom|long-distance walking trail]] \u2013 The [[Great Glen Way]] between [[Fort William, Highland|Fort William]] and [[Inverness]]. The usual 22-minute format was expanded to 44 minutes to fit into an hour time slot. Community Channel premiered it at Christmas 2016, with the other broadcasters following afterwards. This led to the idea of producing regular specials featuring some of the other shorter long-distance trails, which often don't get a lot of publicity.\n\n==Presenters==\n\nThe presenters, and the series they have appeared in, are:\n*[[Andrew White (presenter & writer)|Andrew White]] (lead presenter, series 1-)\n*Leah Hather (presenter, series 1\u20133, 5-)\n*Claire Maxted (presenter, series 5)\n*Zoe Dawes (presenter, series 2)\n*Alannah White (presenter, series 2\u20134, 6-)\n*Olivia White (presenter, series 3\u20134, 6-)\n*Vikkie Lee (presenter, series 6-)\n*[[Alan Hinkes]] (presenter, series 6-)\n\n==Series overview==\n\nIn the main series, each programme lasts 22 minutes and features two walks between 2 and 8 miles \u2013 one walk in part one and one in part two. Usually there is a geographical spread between the two in one programme, but on two occasions so far, a specific area was featured as a \"special\" \u2013 most notably in series 3 when two walks on the island of [[Jersey]] formed a programme. The walks in an episode are sometimes linked with a theme \u2013 as in series 4 with two walks in [[Yorkshire]] from railway stations.\n\nUnlike similar series, ''Walks Around Britain'' doesn't concentrate on \"walks with a view\", but instead aims to tell ''stories''. So, a walk in the programme could well have any elements of [[British heritage]], [[social history]] and the [[natural environment]], but could just as well include [[physical health]], [[mental health]], [[wellbeing]], [[engineering]], [[archaeology]], [[popular history]] and [[biological anthropology]]. In that way, the series is more akin to [[BBC Two]]'s [[Coast (TV series)|Coast]], than other walking series.\n\nAgain, like Coast, the series features one lead presenter \u2013 currently Andrew White \u2013 who introduces the walks and links the programme together. The walks are then either presented by White, or by one of the other regular ''Walks Around Britain'' presenters. This was designed to ensure the series' longevity if and when presenters want to move on. To date, White has presented at least one walk in every edition.  \n\nThe series is designed to encourage and inspire viewers to get outside and do the walks for themselves \u2013 so the programmes feature animated maps showing the walking route and on-screen graphics with information about the length, type and time it would on average take to do the walk. It also features the starting point as a [[grid reference]] and lists the relevant [[Ordnance Survey]] map which would be needed for the walk. Each of the walks have a dedicated page on the [[Walks Around Britain]] website with more detailed information.\n\n''Walks Around Britain'' is currently the only walking series in Britain to regularly feature children, as White's own daughters, Alannah and Olivia are often go the walks. It is also the only mainstream walking series to feature [[dogs]] \u2013 as White's own four [[border collies]] frequently go on the walks.\n\nAlthough broadcasters are encouraged to show the programmes in order, the programmes are designed to be \"stand alone\", so there isn't any mention of what walks are coming up on the next episode.\n\nAll the series have been filmed and edited in [[high-definition television|high-definition]], but have never been transmitted on any broadcast channel in this format as all the broadcasters who show the series are standard-definition only. The series is available in high-definition on [[Amazon Prime Video]] and ''Walks Around Britain+'' - the series own video on-demand subscription website, with a selection of editions available free in high-definition on the ''Walks Around Britain'' YouTube channel.\n\n===Series 1 (2016)===\n\nThe first series of ''Walks Around Britain'' was originally aired on [[Together (TV channel)|Community Channel]] during the winter and spring of 2016. It has subsequently been broadcast on 22 channels in the UK.\n\nThe series visited Scotland twice, Wales once and the most southerly walk was on the north coast of Cornwall. Two walks on the Isle of Man also featured.\n\nThe part lengths for series 1 vary considerably as most of the walks were remastered from the original ''Walks Around Britain'' YouTube channel. This led to programmes in series 1 being edited to fit a 22-minute time slot when they were broadcast on [[Local Television Limited|Made Television network]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#389cff;\"| Series<br />No.\n! style=\"background:#389cff;\"| Episode<br />No.\n! style=\"background:#389cff;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#389cff;\"| Directed by\n! style=\"background:#389cff;\"| Written by\n! style=\"background:#389cff;\"| Original Air Date\n\n{{Episode list/sublist|Walks Around Britain (TV series)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = [[Monsal Trail]] and [[Caledonian Canal]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2016|01|22}}\n |DirectedBy      = Andrew White\n |WrittenBy       = Andrew White\n |ShortSummary    = Andrew White walks on a disused railway in the [[Peak District]] and alongside the Caledonian Canal.\n |LineColor       = 389CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Walks Around Britain (TV series)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title           = [[Boscastle]] and [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2016|01|29}}\n |DirectedBy      = Andrew White\n |WrittenBy       = Andrew White\n |ShortSummary    = Andrew White walks along the coast at Boscastle, [[Cornwall]] and visits Ramsey on the [[Isle of Man]].\n |LineColor       = 389CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Walks Around Britain (TV series)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n |Title           = [[Ladybower Reservoir]] and [[Windermere]] \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2016|02|5}}\n |DirectedBy      = Andrew White\n |WrittenBy       = Andrew White\n |ShortSummary    = Andrew White walks above and alongside 2 large bodies of water - Ladybower Reservoir and Windermere.\n |LineColor       = 389CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Walks Around Britain (TV series)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n |Title           = The [[Great Orme]] and [[Haworth]] to [[Oakworth]] \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2016|02|12}}\n |DirectedBy      = Andrew White\n |WrittenBy       = Andrew White\n |ShortSummary    = Andrew White walks up The Great Orme in [[North Wales]] and besides a railway in [[West Yorkshire]].\n |LineColor       = 389CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Walks Around Britain (TV series)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n |Title           = [[Flamborough Head]] and [[Clumber Park]] \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2016|02|19}}\n |DirectedBy      = Dave Thorp & Andrew White\n |WrittenBy       = Andrew White\n |ShortSummary    = Andrew White walks along the cliffs at Flamborough Head and through Clumber Park, [[Nottinghamshire]].\n |LineColor       = 389CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Walks Around Britain (TV series)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n |Title           = The Coast of the Isle of Man and [[Sprotbrough]] \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2016|02|26}}\n |DirectedBy      = Andrew White\n |WrittenBy       = Andrew White\n |ShortSummary    = Andrew White walks along the Isle of Man's stunning coast and Leah Hather visits Sprotbrough in [[South Yorkshire]].\n |LineColor       = 389CFF\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Walks Around Britain (TV series)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 7\n |Title           = [[Banavie]] to [[Gairlochy]] and the [[Ribblehead Viaduct]]. \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2016|03|04}}\n |DirectedBy      = Andrew White\n |WrittenBy       = Andrew White\n |ShortSummary    = Andrew White walks from Banavie to Gairlochy in the Scottish Highlands and around the Ribblehead Viaduct in the [[Yorkshire Dales]].\n |LineColor       = 389CFF\n}}\n|}\n\n===Series 2 (2016)===\n\nThe second series of ''Walks Around Britain'' was originally aired on Community Channel during the summer of 2016. It has subsequently been broadcast on 22 channels in the UK.\n\nThis series visited Scotland once, Wales once and included a walk on Jersey for the first time. To date, this series has the highest number of walks in a particular [[National parks of the United Kingdom|National Park]] \u2013 being in this instance the Lake District.\n\nThe part lengths and total running times for series 2 settled down to be a constant 11 minutes per part and 22 minutes in total, in order to fit into timeslots correctly when they were broadcast on [[Local Television Limited|Made Television network]]. That structure has continued throughout the series into the future.\n\nThe timescales between production and broadcast were so tight on series 2 that presenter Andrew White had to record a voice over for the Wolverhampton walk in programme 3 whilst suffering with a very bad throat, so the original Community Channel broadcast of programme 3 featured this croaky narration. When his vice recovered later, he re-recorded the voice over, and it is this version which is available now.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:silver;\"| Series<br />No.\n! style=\"background:silver;\"| Episode<br />No.\n! style=\"background:silver;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:silver;\"| Directed by\n! style=\"background:silver;\"| Written by\n! style=\"background:silver;\"| Original air date\n\n{{Episode list/sublist|Walks Around Britain (TV series)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = [[Holmfirth]] and Wansfell Pike \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2016|5|27}}\n |DirectedBy      = Dave Thorp & Andrew White\n |WrittenBy       = Andrew White\n |ShortSummary    = Andrew White walks with artist [[Ashley Jackson (artist)|Ashley Jackson]] in Holmfirth and to the top of Wansfell Pike in the [[Lake District]].\n |LineColor       = C0C0C0\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Walks Around Britain (TV series)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title           = [[Goole]] and [[Trentham Estate]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2016|6|3}}\n |DirectedBy      = Dave Thorp & Andrew White\n |WrittenBy       = Andrew White\n |ShortSummary    = Andrew White takes a surprising walk around Goole and through the Trentham Estate in [[Staffordshire]].\n |LineColor       = C0C0C0\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Walks Around Britain (TV series)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n |Title           = [[Wolverhampton]] Canal and [[Sour Howes]] \n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2016|06|10}}\n |DirectedBy      = Andrew White\n |WrittenBy       = Andrew White\n |ShortSummary    = Andrew White walks alongside a canal in Wolverhampton and to the top of Sour Howes in the Lake District.\n |LineColor       = C0C0C0\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Walks Around Britain (TV series)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n |Title           = [[Brant Fell]] and [[Grasmere (village)|Grasmere]] to [[Rydal, Cumbria|Rydal]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2016|06|17}}\n |DirectedBy      = Andrew White\n |WrittenBy       = Andrew White\n |ShortSummary    = A Lake District Special - Andrew White walks to the top of Brant Fell and Zoe Dawes visits Grasmere and Rydal.\n |LineColor       = C0C0C0\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Walks Around Britain (TV series)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n |Title           = [[Carreg Cennen Castle]] and the [[Jersey]] Moonwalk\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2016|06|24}}\n |DirectedBy      = Andrew White\n |WrittenBy       = Andrew White\n |ShortSummary    = Andrew White walks around Carreg Cennen Castle in the [[Brecon Beacons]] and takes an unusual trek in Jersey.\n |LineColor       = C0C0C0\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Walks Around Britain (TV series)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n |Title           = Coombs Dale and [[Glenridding Dodd]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2016|07|1}}\n |DirectedBy      = Andrew White\n |WrittenBy       = Andrew White\n |ShortSummary    = Andrew White walks through the haunted Coombs Dale in the Peak District and to the summit of Glenridding Dodd in the Lake District.\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Walks Around Britain (TV series)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 7\n |Title           = Muirtown Basin and [[Hugh Town]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|df=yes|2016|07|8}}\n |DirectedBy      = Andrew White\n |WrittenBy       = Andrew White\n |ShortSummary    = Andrew White walks around the Muirtown Basin in [[Inverness]] and Hugh Town on the [[Isles of Scilly]].\n |LineColor       = C0C0C0\n}}\n|}\n\n===Series 3 (2017)===\n\nThe third series of ''Walks Around Britain'' was originally aired on [[Local Television Limited|Made Television]] during the spring and summer of 2017.

Unlike in [[1999\u20132000 Serie A|2000]], it did not have matters in its own hands prior to the final game of the season, and even though Juventus fended off [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]] 2\u20131 at home, [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] beat [[Parma F.C.|Parma]] 3\u20131, which meant the title landed with a Roman club for the second year running.\n\nThe determining moment of the title race had been a showdown between Juventus and Roma at the [[Stadio delle Alpi]] with six games to go, and the ''Bianconeri'' closing down on the Romans who had suffered a recent dip in their form. In front of their crowd, Juventus began the brightest. Two goals in quick succession by [[Alessandro Del Piero]] and [[Zinedine Zidane]] gave them a lead they held on to until the 79th minute, when [[Edwin van der Sar]] took center stage. The Dutch goalkeeper fumbled a long-range effort from Roma's Japanese midfielder [[Hidetoshi Nakata]], enabling the latter to score a fortunate goal. In added time, [[Vincenzo Montella]] equalized for the Roman club, thus denying Juventus a vital victory.\n\n''La Vecchia Signora'' did win all five of its remaining games after that, but in the meantime, Roma did enough to make sure they didn't lose the top spot of the table, thus winning their first ''scudetto'' since 1983. The success was celebrated wildly in the streets of the Italian capital, and the fact that Roma had beaten bitter rivals Juventus to the title made the supporters even happier.\n\nIn the Champions League, Juventus was a major disappointment, getting knocked out in the first group stage of the tournament. It was the first time in the club's history that it had been knocked so early in the competition. This performance put [[Carlo Ancelotti]]'s position at the helm under even more threat. Ancelotti had already been associated in the [[1999\u20132000 UEFA Cup|previous season]] with the club's worst run in any European competition since the 1987\u201388 season. As a man who had been associated with Juve's rivals [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] and Parma for most of his footballing career, he had never been a popular choice with the fans, with frequent doubts being raised about his lack of concern for the club's declining fortunes.\n\nIn the summer of 2001, wholesale changes were made.

Football Club]]''''s 103rd in existence and 99th consecutive season in the top flight of [[Football in Italy|Italian football]].\n\n==Season review==\nJuventus just came up short in [[Serie A]] for the second year in a row. Unlike in [[1999\u20132000 Serie A|2000]], it did not have matters in its own hands prior to the final game of the season, and even though Juventus fended off [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]] 2\u20131 at home, [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] beat [[Parma F.C.|Parma]] 3\u20131, which meant the title landed with a Roman club for the second year running.\n\nThe determining moment of the title race had been a showdown between Juventus and Roma at the [[Stadio delle Alpi]] with six games to go, and the ''Bianconeri'' closing down on the Romans who had suffered a recent dip in their form. In front of their crowd, Juventus began the brightest. Two goals in quick succession by [[Alessandro Del Piero]] and [[Zinedine Zidane]] gave them a lead they held on to until the 79th minute, when [[Edwin van der Sar]] took center stage. The Dutch goalkeeper fumbled a long-range effort from Roma's Japanese midfielder [[Hidetoshi Nakata]], enabling the latter to score a fortunate goal. In added time, [[Vincenzo Montella]] equalized for the Roman club, thus denying Juventus a vital victory.\n\n''La Vecchia Signora'' did win all five of its remaining games after that, but in the meantime, Roma did enough to make sure they didn't lose the top spot of the table, thus winning their first ''scudetto'' since 1983. The success was celebrated wildly in the streets of the Italian capital, and the fact that Roma had beaten bitter rivals Juventus to the title made the supporters even happier.\n\nIn the Champions League, Juventus was a major disappointment, getting knocked out in the first group stage of the tournament. It was the first time in the club's history that it had been knocked so early in the competition. This performance put [[Carlo Ancelotti]]'s position at the helm under even more threat. Ancelotti had already been associated in the [[1999\u20132000 UEFA Cup|previous season]] with the club's worst run in any European competition since the 1987\u201388 season. As a man who had been associated with Juve's rivals [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] and Parma for most of his footballing career, he had never been a popular choice with the fans, with frequent doubts being raised about his lack of concern for the club's declining fortunes.\n\nIn the summer of 2001, wholesale changes were made. [[Marcello Lippi]] returned to his old job prior to the [[2001\u201302 Juventus F.C. season|2001\u201302]] season. It was also [[Zinedine Zidane]]'s last season with Juventus as he was sold for a world record fee to Real Madrid, but the Italian club compensated his loss with four new players during the summer, with [[Gianluigi Buffon]] and [[Lilian Thuram]] coming from Parma, and [[Pavel Nedv\u011bd]] and [[Marcelo Salas]] came from [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]].\n\n==Players==\n\n===Squad information===\n{{fs start}}\n{{fs player|no=1|nat=NED|pos=GK|name=[[Edwin van der Sar]]}}\n{{fs player|no=2|nat=ITA|pos=DF|name=[[Ciro Ferrara]]}}\n{{fs player|no=3|nat=ITA|pos=DF|name=[[Michele Paramatti]]}}\n{{fs player|no=4|nat=URU|pos=DF|name=[[Paolo Montero]]}}\n{{fs player|no=5|nat=CRO|pos=DF|name=[[Igor Tudor]]}}\n{{fs player|no=6|nat=URU|pos=MF|name=[[Fabi\u00e1n O'Neill]]}}\n{{fs player|no=7|nat=ITA|pos=DF|name=[[Gianluca Pessotto]]}}\n{{fs player|no=8|nat=ITA|pos=MF|name=[[Antonio Conte]]|other=[[Captain (association football)|captain]]}}\n{{fs player|no=9|nat=ITA|pos=FW|name=[[Filippo Inzaghi]]}}\n{{fs player|no=10|nat=ITA|pos=FW|name=[[Alessandro Del Piero]]}}\n{{fs player|no=11|nat=URU|pos=FW|name=[[Daniel Fonseca]]}}\n{{fs player|no=12|nat=ITA|pos=GK|name=[[Michelangelo Rampulla]]}}\n{{fs player|no=13|nat=ITA|pos=DF|name=[[Mark Iuliano]]}}\n{{fs player|no=''14''|nat=ITA|pos=MF|name=''[[Jonathan Bachini]]''}}\n{{fs player|no=15|nat=ITA|pos=DF|name=[[Alessandro Birindelli]]}}\n{{fs player|no=''16''|nat=ITA|pos=DF|name=''[[Marco Zanchi]]''}}\n{{fs player|no=17|nat=FRA|pos=FW|name=[[David Trezeguet]]}}\n{{fs player|no=18|nat=SCG|pos=FW|name=[[Darko Kova\u010devi\u0107]]}}\n{{football squad mid}}\n{{fs player|no=''19''|nat=ARG|pos=FW|name=''[[Juan Esn\u00e1ider]]''}}\n{{fs player|no=20|nat=ITA|pos=MF|name=[[Alessio Tacchinardi]]}}\n{{fs player|no=21|nat=FRA|pos=MF|name=[[Zinedine Zidane]]}}\n{{fs player|no=22|nat=SWE|pos=GK|name=[[Andreas Isaksson]]}}\n{{fs player|no=23|nat=ITA|pos=DF|name=[[Gianluca Zambrotta]]}}\n{{fs player|no=25|nat=ITA|pos=MF|name=[[Matteo Brighi]]}}\n{{fs player|no=26|nat=NED|pos=MF|name=[[Edgar Davids]]}}\n{{fs player|no=27|nat=ITA|pos=MF|name=[[Marco Rigoni]]}}\n{{fs player|no=28|nat=BRA|pos=DF|name=[[Athirson Mazzoli e Oliveira|Athirson]]}}\n{{fs player|no=29|nat=ITA|pos=DF|name=Domenico Maietta}}\n{{fs player|no=30|nat=ITA|pos=DF|name=[[Francesco Scardina]]}}\n{{fs player|no=31|nat=ITA|pos=MF|name=[[Andrea Gasbarroni]]}}\n{{fs player|no=32|nat=ITA|pos=MF|name=Vito Redavid}}\n{{fs player|no=33|nat=FRA|pos=FW|name=[[Vincent P\u00e9ricard]]}}\n{{fs player|no=34|nat=ITA|pos=GK|name=Andrea D'Amico}}\n{{fs player|no=35|nat=URU|pos=GK|name=[[Fabi\u00e1n Carini]]}}\n{{fs player|no=36|nat=ITA|pos=MF|name=Salvatore Papa}}\n{{fs player|no=37|nat=ITA|pos=GK|name=[[Antonio Mirante]]}}\n{{fs end}}\n\n==Competitions==\n\n===Serie A===\n{{main|2000\u201301 Serie A}}\n\n====League table====\n{{:2000\u201301 Serie A|showteam=JUV}}\n\n====Results summary====\n{{Fb_rs |hw=11 |hd=5 |hl=1 |hgf=32 |hga=13 |aw=10 |ad=5 |al=2 |agf=29 |aga=14}}\n{{Fb_rs_footer |u=17 June 2001 |s=[[#Matches|Competitive matches]]|date=July 2000}}\n\n====Results by round====\n{{#invoke:sports rbr table|table|legendpos=b|header=Round\n\n|label1= Ground\n|res1=A/H/A/H/A/H/A/H/A/H/A/A/H/H/A/H/A/H/A/H/A/H/A/H/A/H/A/H/H/A/A/H/A/H\n|label2= Result\n|res2=W/W/D/L/W/D/D/W/D/W/W/D/D/W/W/W/L/W/W/W/W/W/L/D/W/W/D/D/D/W/W/W/W/W\n|label3= Position\n|res3=4/2/3/5/4/4/6/5/6/3/2/2/2/2/2/2/2/2/2/2/2/2/2/2/2/2/2/3/3/3/3/2/2/2\n<!-- -->\n|text_H=Home|text_A=Away\n|color_W=green2|text_W=Win\n|color_D=yellow2|text_D=Draw\n|color_L=red2|text_L=Loss\n|color_1=1st|color_2=2nd|color_3=3rd|color_18-=red1\n\n|updated=17 June 2001\n|source=[[#Matches|Competitive matches]]\n|date=July 2000\n}}\n\n====Matches====\n{{football box collapsible\n|round      = [[Juventus F.C.\u2013S.S.C.
