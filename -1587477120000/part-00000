Other languages have their own suffixes, such as [[Persian language|Persian]] ''e Bozorg'' and [[Urdu]] ''e azam''.\n\nIn Persia, the title \"the Great\" at first seems to have been a colloquial version of the Old Persian title \"Great King\". It was first used by [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus II]] [[Achaemenid Empire|of Persia]].<ref name=\"cyrus\">In a clay [[Cyrus cylinder|cylinder]] ([https://www.livius.org/ct-cz/cyrus_I/cyrus_cylinder.html online]). The first Persian ruler to use the title in an Iranian context was [[Darius I of Persia]] (''Darius the Great''), in the [[Behistun Inscription]] ([https://www.livius.org/be-bm/behistun/behistun01.html online]).</ref> The title was inherited by [[Alexander the Great|Alexander III]] when he conquered the Persian Empire, and the [[epithet]] eventually became personally associated with him. The first reference to this is in a comedy by [[Plautus]],<ref name=\"plautus\">Plautus, ''Mostellaria'' 775.</ref> in which it is assumed that everyone knew who \"Alexander the Great\" was; however, there is no evidence that he was called \"the Great\" before this. The early [[Seleucids|Seleucid]] kings, who succeeded Alexander in Persia, used \"Great King\" in local documents, but the title was most notably used for [[Antiochus the Great]]. Once the term gained currency, it was broadened to include persons in other fields, such as the philosopher [[Albert the Great]].\n\nLater rulers and commanders were given the epithet during their lifetime, for example the Roman general [[Pompey]]. Others received the title posthumously, such as the Carthaginian [[Hanno the Great|Hanno]] and the Indian emperor [[Ashoka]]. As there are no objective criteria for \"greatness\", the persistence of the designation varies greatly. For example, [[Louis XIV of France]] was often referred to as \"the Great\" in his lifetime, but is rarely called such nowadays. German Emperor [[Wilhelm I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I]] was often called \"the Great\" in the time of his grandson [[Wilhelm II]], but rarely before or after. \n\n==Monarchs==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:auto;\"\n|-\n!

Other languages have their own suffixes, such as [[Persian language|Persian]] ''e Bozorg'' and [[Urdu]] ''e azam''.\n\nIn Persia, the title \"the Great\" at first seems to have been a colloquial version of the Old Persian title \"Great King\". It was first used by [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus II]] [[Achaemenid Empire|of Persia]].<ref name=\"cyrus\">In a clay [[Cyrus cylinder|cylinder]] ([https://www.livius.org/ct-cz/cyrus_I/cyrus_cylinder.html online]). The first Persian ruler to use the title in an Iranian context was [[Darius I of Persia]] (''Darius the Great''), in the [[Behistun Inscription]] ([https://www.livius.org/be-bm/behistun/behistun01.html online]).</ref> The title was inherited by [[Alexander the Great|Alexander III]] when he conquered the Persian Empire, and the [[epithet]] eventually became personally associated with him. The first reference to this is in a comedy by [[Plautus]],<ref name=\"plautus\">Plautus, ''Mostellaria'' 775.</ref> in which it is assumed that everyone knew who \"Alexander the Great\" was; however, there is no evidence that he was called \"the Great\" before this. The early [[Seleucids|Seleucid]] kings, who succeeded Alexander in Persia, used \"Great King\" in local documents, but the title was most notably used for [[Antiochus the Great]]. Once the term gained currency, it was broadened to include persons in other fields, such as the philosopher [[Albert the Great]].\n\nLater rulers and commanders were given the epithet during their lifetime, for example the Roman general [[Pompey]]. Others received the title posthumously, such as the Carthaginian [[Hanno the Great|Hanno]] and the Indian emperor [[Ashoka]]. As there are no objective criteria for \"greatness\", the persistence of the designation varies greatly. For example, [[Louis XIV of France]] was often referred to as \"the Great\" in his lifetime, but is rarely called such nowadays. German Emperor [[Wilhelm I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I]] was often called \"the Great\" in the time of his grandson [[Wilhelm II]], but rarely before or after. \n\n==Monarchs==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:auto;\"\n|-\n!

In 1887, however, the existing [[Gaelic Athletic Association county|county boards]] started to organise knock-out championships for the club teams within their own county.  The county club championships were then extended to a national or All-Ireland inter-county series of games.\n\n==Teams==\n\nAll of the existing county boards were eligible to enter a team, however, only six chose to do so.  Disputes in [[Cork GAA|Cork]] and [[Limerick GAA|Limerick]] over which club should represent the county resulted in neither county fielding a team.\n\nIn all five teams participated: [[Clare GAA|Clare]] (Garraunboy Smith O'Briens), [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] (Metropolitans) [[Galway GAA|Galway]] ([[Meelick-Eyrecourt|Meelick]]), [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]] ([[Tullaroan GAA|Tullaroan]]) [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary]] ([[Thurles Sarsfields|Thurles]]) and [[Wexford GAA|Wexford]] (Castlebridge).\n\nAll of the original entrants subsequently went on the claim the All-Ireland title, while all of the participating clubs still exist in some form.\n\n==Format==\n\nFor the only time in its history there were no provincial championships and an open draw was used to determine the pairings in the All-Ireland championship.\n\n'''All-Ireland Championship'''\n\n''First round:'' (1 match) This is a lone match between the first two teams paired together.  One team is eliminated at this stage while the winning team advances to the second round.\n\n''Second round:'' (1 match) This is a lone match between the winner of the first round and another team.  One team is eliminated at this stage while the winning team advances to the semi-finals.\n\n''Semi-final:'' (2 matches) The winners of the second round game join the three remaining teams to make up the semi-final pairings.  Two teams are eliminated at this stage while the two winning teams advance to the final.\n\n''Final:'' (1 match) The winners of the two semi-finals contest this game.  The winners are declared All-Ireland champions.\n\n==Scoring==\n\nA unique scoring system was used in the first championship.  One goal was worth more than any number of points, while \"forfeit points\" (5 forfeit points = 1 point) were awarded in place of 65's. Scores here are given in the form goals-points-forfeit points, e.g. 2-4-1. So (for example), 2-0-0 defeats 1-7-2 (goal outvalues any number of points); 1-3-4 defeats 1-2-7 (3.8 points vs. 3.4 points); 3-0-6 defeats 3-1-0 (six forfeit points outvalue one point).  Similarly, the playing pitch was significantly larger than the modern day pitch, particularly in width, and teams had twenty-one players.
