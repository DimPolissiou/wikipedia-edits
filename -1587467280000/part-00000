They [[tooth development|develop]] during the [[embryo]]nic stage of development and erupt (that is, they become visible in the [[mouth]]) during [[infancy]]. They are usually lost and replaced by [[permanent teeth]], but in the absence of permanent replacements, they can remain functional for many years.\n\n==Development==\n\n=== Formation ===\n[[File:ToothLost-2917.jpg|thumb|left|Bottom teeth of a seven-year-old, showing primary teeth (left), a lost primary tooth and visible [[dental alveolus|socket]] (middle), and a fully erupted permanent tooth (right)]]\n\nPrimary teeth start to form during the embryo phase of [[human development (biology)|human life]]. The development of primary teeth starts at the sixth week of tooth development as the [[dental lamina]]. This process starts at the midline and then spreads back into the posterior region. By the time the embryo is eight weeks old, there are ten buds on the upper and lower arches that will eventually become the primary (deciduous) dentition. These teeth will continue to form until they  [[tooth eruption|erupt]] in the mouth. In the primary dentition, there are a total of twenty teeth: five per quadrant and ten per arch. The eruption of these teeth (\"[[teething]]\") begins at the age of six months and continues until 25\u201333 months of age during the primary dentition period. Usually, the first teeth seen in the mouth are the [[mandibular central incisor|mandibular centrals]] and the last are the [[maxillary second molar]]s.\n\nThe primary teeth are made up of [[maxillary central incisor|central incisors]], [[maxillary lateral incisor|lateral incisors]], [[canine tooth|canines]], first [[molar (tooth)|molar]]s, and [[mandibular second molar|secondary molars]]; there is one in each quadrant, making a total of four of each tooth. All of these are gradually replaced with a permanent counterpart except for the primary first and second molars; they are replaced by [[premolar]]s.\n\nTeething age of primary teeth:\n* Central [[incisor]]s: 6\u201312 months\n* Lateral [[incisor]]s: 9\u201316 months\n* First [[molar (tooth)|molars]]: 13\u201319 months\n* [[canine tooth|Canine teeth]]: 16\u201323 months\n* Second molars: 22\u201333 months\n\n=== Exfoliation ===\nThe replacement of primary teeth begins around age six, when the permanent teeth start to appear in the mouth, resulting in mixed dentition.<ref name=\":1\" />  The upper and lower central incisors are shed at age six to seven years.  The upper and lower lateral incisors are shed at seven to eight years.  The upper canines are shed at ten to twelve years.  The lower canines are shed at nine to twelve years.  The upper and lower first molars are shed at nine to eleven years.  The upper and lower second molars are shed at ten to twelve years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mouthhealthy.org/en/az-topics/e/eruption-charts|title=Tooth Eruption: The primary teeth|website=Mouth healthy.org|publisher=American Dental Association|accessdate=2 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe erupting permanent teeth cause [[root resorption]], where the permanent teeth push on the roots of the primary teeth, causing the roots to be dissolved by [[odontoclast]]s (as well as surrounding alveolar bone by osteoclasts) and become absorbed by the forming permanent teeth. The process of shedding primary teeth and their replacement by permanent teeth is called exfoliation. This may last from six to twelve years of age. By age twelve, there usually are only permanent teeth remaining. However, it is not extremely rare for one or more primary teeth to be retained beyond this age, sometimes well into adulthood, often because the secondary tooth fails to develop.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=S.|last2=Chan|first2=M.

The primary teeth provide guides for the eruption pathway of the permanent teeth. Also the [[muscle]]s of the [[jaw]] and the formation of the jaw bones depend on the primary teeth to maintain proper spacing for permanent teeth. The roots of primary teeth provide an opening for the permanent teeth to erupt. The primary teeth are important for the development of the child's speech, for the child's smile and play a role in [[mastication|chewing]] of food, although children who have had their primary teeth removed (usually as a result of [[tooth decay|dental caries]]) can still eat and chew to a certain extent.\n\n==Society and culture==\nIn almost all European languages the primary teeth are called \"baby teeth\" or \"milk teeth\". In the United States and Canada, the term \"baby teeth\" is common. In some Asian countries they are referred to as \"fall teeth\" since they will eventually fall out.\n\nAlthough shedding of a milk tooth is predominantly associated with positive emotions such as pride and joy by the majority of the children, socio-cultural factors (such as parental education, religion or country of origin) affect the various emotions children experience during the loss of their first primary tooth.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Patcas |first1=Raphael |title=Emotions experienced during the shedding of the first primary tooth |journal=International Journal of Paediatric Dentistry |date=2019 |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=22\u201328 |doi=10.1111/ipd.12427|pmid=30218480 |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nVarious cultures have customs relating to the loss of deciduous teeth. In English-speaking countries, the [[tooth fairy]] is a popular childhood fiction that a [[fairy]] rewards children when their baby teeth fall out. Children typically place a tooth under their pillow at night. The fairy is said to take the tooth and replace it with money or small gifts while they sleep. In some parts of [[Australia]], [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]], the children put the tooth in a glass of water. In medieval Scandinavia there was a similar tradition, surviving to the present day in Iceland, of ''[[Tooth fairy|tannf\u00e9]]'' ('tooth-money'), a gift to a child when it cuts its first tooth.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Richard |last1=Cleasby |authorlink1=Richard Cleasby |first2=Gudbrand |last2=Vigf\u00fasson |authorlink2=Gu\u00f0brandur Vigf\u00fasson |title= An Icelandic-English Dictionary |edition= 2nd |work=[[William Craigie|William A.

They [[tooth development|develop]] during the [[embryo]]nic stage of development and erupt (that is, they become visible in the [[mouth]]) during [[infancy]]. They are usually lost and replaced by [[permanent teeth]], but in the absence of permanent replacements, they can remain functional for many years.\n\n==Development==\n\n=== Formation ===\n[[File:ToothLost-2917.jpg|thumb|left|Bottom teeth of a seven-year-old, showing primary teeth (left), a lost primary tooth and visible [[dental alveolus|socket]] (middle), and a fully erupted permanent tooth (right)]]\n\nPrimary teeth start to form during the embryo phase of [[human development (biology)|human life]]. The development of primary teeth starts at the sixth week of tooth development as the [[dental lamina]]. This process starts at the midline and then spreads back into the posterior region. By the time the embryo is eight weeks old, there are ten buds on the upper and lower arches that will eventually become the primary (deciduous) dentition. These teeth will continue to form until they  [[tooth eruption|erupt]] in the mouth. In the primary dentition, there are a total of twenty teeth: five per quadrant and ten per arch. The eruption of these teeth (\"[[teething]]\") begins at the age of six months and continues until 25\u201333 months of age during the primary dentition period. Usually, the first teeth seen in the mouth are the [[mandibular central incisor|mandibular centrals]] and the last are the [[maxillary second molar]]s.\n\nThe primary teeth are made up of [[maxillary central incisor|central incisors]], [[maxillary lateral incisor|lateral incisors]], [[canine tooth|canines]], first [[molar (tooth)|molar]]s, and [[mandibular second molar|secondary molars]]; there is one in each quadrant, making a total of four of each tooth. All of these are gradually replaced with a permanent counterpart except for the primary first and second molars; they are replaced by [[premolar]]s.\n\nTeething age of primary teeth:\n* Central [[incisor]]s: 6\u201312 months\n* Lateral [[incisor]]s: 9\u201316 months\n* First [[molar (tooth)|molars]]: 13\u201319 months\n* [[canine tooth|Canine teeth]]: 16\u201323 months\n* Second molars: 22\u201333 months\n\n=== Exfoliation ===\nThe replacement of primary teeth begins around age six, when the permanent teeth start to appear in the mouth, resulting in mixed dentition.<ref name=\":1\" />  The upper and lower central incisors are shed at age six to seven years.  The upper and lower lateral incisors are shed at seven to eight years.  The upper canines are shed at ten to twelve years.  The lower canines are shed at nine to twelve years.  The upper and lower first molars are shed at nine to eleven years.  The upper and lower second molars are shed at ten to twelve years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mouthhealthy.org/en/az-topics/e/eruption-charts|title=Tooth Eruption: The primary teeth|website=Mouth healthy.org|publisher=American Dental Association|accessdate=2 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe erupting permanent teeth cause [[root resorption]], where the permanent teeth push on the roots of the primary teeth, causing the roots to be dissolved by [[odontoclast]]s (as well as surrounding alveolar bone by osteoclasts) and become absorbed by the forming permanent teeth. The process of shedding primary teeth and their replacement by permanent teeth is called exfoliation. This may last from six to twelve years of age. By age twelve, there usually are only permanent teeth remaining. However, it is not extremely rare for one or more primary teeth to be retained beyond this age, sometimes well into adulthood, often because the secondary tooth fails to develop.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=S.|last2=Chan|first2=M.

The primary teeth provide guides for the eruption pathway of the permanent teeth. Also the [[muscle]]s of the [[jaw]] and the formation of the jaw bones depend on the primary teeth to maintain proper spacing for permanent teeth. The roots of primary teeth provide an opening for the permanent teeth to erupt. The primary teeth are important for the development of the child's speech, for the child's smile and play a role in [[mastication|chewing]] of food, although children who have had their primary teeth removed (usually as a result of [[tooth decay|dental caries]]) can still eat and chew to a certain extent.\n\n==Society and culture==\nIn almost all European languages the primary teeth are called \"baby teeth\" or \"milk teeth\". In the United States and Canada, the term \"baby teeth\" is common. In some Asian countries they are referred to as \"fall teeth\" since they will eventually fall out.\n\nAlthough shedding of a milk tooth is predominantly associated with positive emotions such as pride and joy by the majority of the children, socio-cultural factors (such as parental education, religion or country of origin) affect the various emotions children experience during the loss of their first primary tooth.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Patcas |first1=Raphael |title=Emotions experienced during the shedding of the first primary tooth |journal=International Journal of Paediatric Dentistry |date=2019 |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=22\u201328 |doi=10.1111/ipd.12427|pmid=30218480 |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nVarious cultures have customs relating to the loss of deciduous teeth. In English-speaking countries, the [[tooth fairy]] is a popular childhood fiction that a [[fairy]] rewards children when their baby teeth fall out. Children typically place a tooth under their pillow at night. The fairy is said to take the tooth and replace it with money or small gifts while they sleep. In some parts of [[Australia]], [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]], the children put the tooth in a glass of water. In medieval Scandinavia there was a similar tradition, surviving to the present day in Iceland, of ''[[Tooth fairy|tannf\u00e9]]'' ('tooth-money'), a gift to a child when it cuts its first tooth.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Richard |last1=Cleasby |authorlink1=Richard Cleasby |first2=Gudbrand |last2=Vigf\u00fasson |authorlink2=Gu\u00f0brandur Vigf\u00fasson |title= An Icelandic-English Dictionary |edition= 2nd |work=[[William Craigie|William A.

It was first settled in the 1850s by [[United Empire Loyalist]]s and Irish immigrants. From the mid-1950s to about 1982 mining was the primary industry. A village until 1999, Bancroft then merged with Dungannon Township to form the Town of Bancroft. The population at the time of the 2016 Census was 3,881.\n\n== History ==\nBy 1823, the government had purchased nearly two million acres of land from the Chippewa and Mississaga First Nations including a tract on the York River in Hastings County which had been established in 1792.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://town.bancroft.on.ca/index.php/living/about-bancroft|title=Bancroft, Ontario - About Bancroft|author=|date=|website=town.bancroft.on.ca|accessdate=20 April 2018}}</ref> The area was mapped in 1835 by explorer [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]].<ref name=\"bancroftontario.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bancroftontario.com/history-bancroft-area/bancroft-history/ |title=The History of Bancroft, Ontario |website=bancroftontario.com |accessdate=December 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first family to build a cabin here, the Clarks in 1853, did so to take advantage of the fur trade.  Early settlers included James Cleak and Alfred Barker from England who arrived in 1855, settling on Quarry Lake. They got jobs in administration; Cleak opened a small store and  Barker became the first postmaster. Over the years the settlement grew quickly; there were 89 families by 1868.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=uXk3yUgj1yYC&pg=PA99&dq=Kingston,+ontario&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiBna2wxr7TAhVL7YMKHfRMD744HhDoAQg3MAQ#v=onepage&q=bancroft%2C%20ontario&f=false| page=28-30 |title=Hidden Ontario: Secrets from Ontario\u2019s Past (second edition)|last=Boyle|first=Terry |date=2011 |accessdate=December 14, 2018}}</ref> Lumber companies arrived to remove timber.\n\nSome of the earliest settlers were [[United Empire Loyalist]]s, but from 1856 to 1861, most were from Ireland, fleeing the problems caused by the [[Great Famine (Ireland)]]; many had farming experience and settled in the Township of Dungannon where the land was fertile. Most of the settlers were attracted to the area by the offer of free {{convert|100|acre|km2|adj=on}} parcels that had been advertised in Great Britain.<ref name=\"bancroftontario.com\"/>\nSome of the residents also sold furs, obtained through [[Animal trapping|trapping]].\n\nThe settlement had various names over the first years, York Mills, York River and York Branch; when the post office opened in 1861 it was called York River.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Nila|title=Bancroft, a Bonanza of Memories|year=1979|publisher=Bancroft Centennial Committee|page=90|url=http://www.ourroots.ca/e/page.aspx?id=957965}}</ref> A grist mill opened in 1865, gold was discovered in 1866 and other minerals would be discovered later.

In 1903, the [[Irondale, Bancroft and Ottawa Railway]] connected to the COR north of town at what is now Y Road, referring to the [[wye junction]] joining the two lines. They were beneficial in transporting settlers and goods; the railway would operate until 1982. Bancroft was incorporated as a village in December 1904. The first telephone in the village was at the railway station; it was connected in 1905. Electricity was not available until 1930.<ref name=about/><ref name=\"bancroftontario.com1\"/><ref name=\"bancroftontario.com2\"/>\n\nUranium was discovered in 1949 and construction of the first mine (Faraday) started in 1952. The very large [[Madawaska Mine]] operated until 1982. Other minerals were also mined over the years.<ref name=\"bancroftontario.com1\"/> The closing of the mine caused some economic hardship.

American sportsmen fished and hunted on this private lake for 40 years before it became a park. Silent Lake has a rocky and undeveloped shoreline, a mixed forest and marshes full of birds and wildlife best seen by canoe. A rugged trail circles the lake, and sections of groomed ski trails have been graded for mountain biking.\n\n[[Algonquin Provincial Park]] about an hour away on Highway 62 N - Highway 127 N - Highway 60 W provides camping and [[hiking]] opportunities, beautiful forest and outdoor scenery. Portaging is quite common in this park. Algonquin offers many visitor attractions. Like Silent Lake, Algonquin has a rocky, treed and extensive undeveloped shoreline, a mixed forest and marshes full of birds and wildlife best seen by canoe. The OFSC trails through the park provide easy winter access by snowmobile.\n\nOne of the most common sights is the Canadian Moose.\n\n== Arts ==\nIn 2004, Bancroft won [[TVOntario]]'s \"Most Talented Town in Ontario\" contest. A large number of artists and artisans live in the surrounding area, and exhibit together in events like the \"Fall Studio Tour\".\n\nThe Art Gallery of Bancroft (AGB) is the area's only public not-for profit art gallery. Completely run by dedicated volunteers, the AGB mounts 11-12 exhibitions per year celebrating the work of local and regional artists and artisans. These exhibitions include the popular annual \"Juried Show\" and the annual student show displaying the work of four regional high schools. The gallery gift shop displays the paintings and fine crafts of area artists and the AGB boasts a permanent collection including some of Ontario's finest artists.\n\nThe town is home to the \"Village Playhouse\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bancroftvillageplayhouse.ca|title=The Village Playhouse - Best of the Arts in North Hastings|work=bancroftvillageplayhouse.ca|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref> a theatre which has been hosting sold out plays, musicals and concerts since the early 1990s. Formerly the Bancroft Community Hall, the historical building was once the local jail, court house and library.\n\n== Transportation ==\n[[Image:Old station Bancroft ON.JPG|thumb|225px|right|Old train station (in 2006)]]\n\nBancroft lies at the intersection of two provincial highways, [[Ontario Highway 28|Highway 28]] and [[Ontario Highway 62|Highway 62]], with several other inroads allowing access to the city.\n\nBancroft is served by the [[Bancroft Airport|Jack Brown Airport]], a [[Transport Canada]] Registered Aerodrome (CNW3), with a 2,200 foot (670 m) crushed gravel runway, located immediately adjoining the town. A small airport, it was named after the man who was reeve at the time and instrumental in its construction.  Currently operated by the [[Bancroft Flying Club]], the Jack Brown Airport is freely available to the general public and frequently referred to as The Bancroft Airport. Due to high terrain near both ends of the runway, pilots typically use a non-standard circuit, following the York River valley through the town for departing from runway 12 or landing on runway 30.\n\nThe [[Central Ontario Railway]] arrived in November 1900 connecting Bancroft with Trenton. The railway went through the Musclow-Greenview road and extended behind Birds Creek through a back trail (which is now used for cyclists and fourwheeling) and continued through the town eventually going further away from the town at the 'Y' road division. The line was closed in 1975 and subsequently removed. The [[Bancroft, Irondale and Ottawa Railway]] connected Bancroft with [[Kinmount]], Ontario. The line was purchased by the Canadian Northern Ontario Railway which became part of the Canadian National Railways in 1918. The line was abandoned in 1960.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nThe old train station in Bancroft served as the Chamber of Commerce and Mineral Museum until it was condemned in 2008. The Chamber, Mineral Museum, and Art Gallery relocated to other sites in the town. In 2011, the old station was moved onto a new foundation;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tedfordhousemovers.com/Tedford_House_Movers/Photo_Albums/Pages/Bancroft_Train_Station.html|title=Bancroft Train station lift|work=tedfordhousemovers.com|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref> it is now restored with an addition at the southern end of the building to house the Bancroft Gem and Mineral Club's museum<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcdougallminerals.com/blog/tag/bancroft-railway-station/|title=Bancroft Railway Station \u00ab  McDougall Minerals|work=mcdougallminerals.com|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref> and a [[caboose]], which is not currently in use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://moosefm.com/chmss/news/use-of-the-caboose/|title=Use of the Caboose - My Bancroft Now|work=moosefm.com|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n\n===Print===\n*Bancroft Times, an independently-owned weekly (5000 copies, paid circulation) founded 1894.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebancrofttimes.ca|title=Bancroft Times|work=thebancrofttimes.ca|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Bancroft This Week]]\n*North Hastings Advertiser\n\n===Radio===\n\n* FM 97.7 - [[CHMS-FM]] (\"[[Vista Broadcast Group|Moose FM]]\"), [[Adult contemporary music|hot adult contemporary]]\n* FM 99.3 - [[CBLA-FM|CBLA-FM-5]], ''(formerly AM 600 [[List of defunct CBC radio transmitters in Canada|CBLV]])'' [[CBC Radio One]];

It was first settled in the 1850s by [[United Empire Loyalist]]s and Irish immigrants. From the mid 1950s to about 1982 mining was the primary industry. A village until 1999, Bancroft then merged with Dungannon Township to form the Town of Bancroft. The population at the time of the 2016 Census was 3,881.\n\n== History ==\nBy 1823, the government had purchased nearly two million acres of land from the Chippewa and Mississaga First Nations including a tract on the York River in Hastings County which had been established in 1792.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://town.bancroft.on.ca/index.php/living/about-bancroft|title=Bancroft, Ontario - About Bancroft|author=|date=|website=town.bancroft.on.ca|accessdate=20 April 2018}}</ref> The area was mapped in 1835 by explorer [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]].<ref name=\"bancroftontario.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bancroftontario.com/history-bancroft-area/bancroft-history/ |title=The History of Bancroft, Ontario |website=bancroftontario.com |accessdate=December 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first family to build a cabin here, the Clarks in 1853, did so to take advantage of the fur trade.  Early settlers included James Cleak and Alfred Barker from England who arrived in 1855, settling on Quarry Lake. They got jobs in administration; Cleak opened a small store and  Barker became the first postmaster. Over the years the settlement grew quickly; there were 89 families by 1868.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=uXk3yUgj1yYC&pg=PA99&dq=Kingston,+ontario&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiBna2wxr7TAhVL7YMKHfRMD744HhDoAQg3MAQ#v=onepage&q=bancroft%2C%20ontario&f=false| page=28-30 |title=Hidden Ontario: Secrets from Ontario\u2019s Past (second edition)|last=Boyle|first=Terry |date=2011 |accessdate=December 14, 2018}}</ref> Lumber companies arrived to remove timber.\n\nSome of the earliest settlers were [[United Empire Loyalist]]s, but from 1856 to 1861, most were from Ireland, fleeing the problems caused by the [[Great Famine (Ireland)]]; many had farming experience and settled in the Township of Dungannon where the land was fertile. Most of the settlers were attracted to the area by the offer of free {{convert|100|acre|km2|adj=on}} parcels that had been advertised in Great Britain.<ref name=\"bancroftontario.com\"/>\nSome of the residents also sold furs, obtained through [[Animal trapping|trapping]].\n\nThe settlement had various names over the first years, York Mills, York River and York Branch; when the post office opened in 1861 it was called York River.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Nila|title=Bancroft, a Bonanza of Memories|year=1979|publisher=Bancroft Centennial Committee|page=90|url=http://www.ourroots.ca/e/page.aspx?id=957965}}</ref> A grist mill opened in 1865, gold was discovered in 1866 and other minerals would be discovered later.

In 1903, the [[Irondale, Bancroft and Ottawa Railway]] connected to the COR north of town at what is now Y Road, referring to the [[wye junction]] joining the two lines. They were beneficial in transporting settlers and goods; the railway would operate until 1982. Bancroft was incorporated as a village in December 1904. The first telephone in the village was at the railway station; it was connected in 1905. Electricity was not available until 1930.<ref name=about/><ref name=\"bancroftontario.com1\"/><ref name=\"bancroftontario.com2\"/>\n\nUranium was discovered in 1949 and construction of the first mine (Faraday) started in 1952. The very large [[Madawaska Mine]] operated until 1982. Other minerals were also mined over the years.<ref name=\"bancroftontario.com1\"/> The closing of the mine caused some economic hardship. In 1999, Bancroft merged with Dungannon Township to form the Town of Bancroft.<ref name=\"bancroftontario.com2\"/>\n\nAs of the Oct 2018 Municipal election, the current Mayor is Paul Jenkins<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://town.bancroft.on.ca/index.php/town-hall/mayor-a-council/meet-the-mayor-a-council|title=Meet the Mayor & Council|website=town.bancroft.on.ca|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-11-12}}</ref>.\n\n==Demographics==\n\n{{Canada census\n |2016_population=3881 | 2016_pop_delta=0.0 | 2016_land_area=229.51 | 2016_pop_density=16.9\n |2016_median_age=53.4 | 2016_median_age_m=52.5 | 2016_median_age_f=54.3\n |2016_total_pvt_dwell=1944 | 2016_mean_hh_income= | 2016_access_date=2018-02-19 \n |2011_population=3880 | 2011_pop_delta=+1.1 | 2011_land_area=229.56 | 2011_pop_density=16.9\n |2011_median_age=49.4 | 2011_median_age_m=47.9 | 2011_median_age_f=50.8\n |2011_total_pvt_dwell=1896 | 2011_mean_hh_income= | 2011_access_date=2012-02-29\n |2006_population=3838 | 2006_pop_delta=-6.1 | 2006_land_area=227.84 | 2006_pop_density=16.8\n |2006_median_age=47.0 | 2006_median_age_m=45.9 | 2006_median_age_f=48.2\n |2006_total_pvt_dwell=1849 | 2006_mean_hh_income=38,480 | 2006_access_date=2012-02-29\n |2001_population=4089 | 2001_pop_delta=+0.2 | 2001_land_area=227.85 | 2001_pop_density=17.9\n |2001_median_age=42.5 | 2001_median_age_m=40.9 | 2001_median_age_f=44.0\n |2001_total_pvt_dwell=1915 | 2001_mean_hh_income=29,684 | 2001_access_date=2012-02-29\n}}\n{{Historical populations\n|align=centre\n|footnote=<ref>Statistics Canada: [[Canada 1996 Census|1996]], [[Canada 2001 Census|2001]], [[Canada 2006 Census|2006]], [[Canada 2011 Census|2011]], [[Canada 2016 Census|2016]] census</ref>\n|[[Canada 1996 Census|1996]]| 4080\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]| 4089\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]| 3838\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]| 3880\n|[[Canada 2016 Census|2016]]| 3881\n}}\nPrior to amalgamation (1999):\n* Total Population in 1996: 4,080\n** Bancroft (village): 2,554\n** Dungannon (township): 1,526\n* Population in 1991:\n** Bancroft (village): 2,383\n** Dungannon (township): 1,412\n\nMother tongue:<ref name=\"cp2006-Clearview\">{{cite web | publisher = Statistics Canada | title =\n2006 Community Profiles - Community highlights for Clearview |work=[[Canada 2006 Census|2006 Census data]] | url = http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/profiles/community/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3543005&Geo2=PR&Code2=35&Data=Count&SearchText=clearview&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=Labour&Custom= | accessdate = 2010-12-15}}</ref>\n* English as first language: 96.4%\n* French as first language: 0.8%\n* English and French as first language: 0.3%\n* Other as first language: 2.5%\n\n== Camping and hiking ==\n[[Silent Lake Provincial Park]] nearby south on Highway 28 provides local [[camping]] opportunities. American sportsmen fished and hunted on this private lake for 40 years before it became a park. Silent Lake has a rocky and undeveloped shoreline, a mixed forest and marshes full of birds and wildlife best seen by canoe. A rugged trail circles the lake, and sections of groomed ski trails have been graded for mountain biking.\n\n[[Algonquin Provincial Park]] about an hour away on Highway 62 N - Highway 127 N - Highway 60 W provides camping and [[hiking]] opportunities, beautiful forest and outdoor scenery. Portaging is quite common in this park. Algonquin offers many visitor attractions. Like Silent Lake, Algonquin has a rocky, treed and extensive undeveloped shoreline, a mixed forest and marshes full of birds and wildlife best seen by canoe. The OFSC trails through the park provide easy winter access by snowmobile.\n\nOne of the most common sights is the Canadian Moose.\n\n== Arts ==\nIn 2004, Bancroft won [[TVOntario]]'s \"Most Talented Town in Ontario\" contest. A large number of artists and artisans live in the surrounding area, and exhibit together in events like the \"Fall Studio Tour\".\n\nThe Art Gallery of Bancroft (AGB) is the area's only public not-for profit art gallery. Completely run by dedicated volunteers, the AGB mounts 11-12 exhibitions per year celebrating the work of local and regional artists and artisans. These exhibitions include the popular annual \"Juried Show\" and the annual student show displaying the work of four regional high schools. The gallery gift shop displays the paintings and fine crafts of area artists and the AGB boasts a permanent collection including some of Ontario's finest artists.\n\nThe town is home to the \"Village Playhouse\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bancroftvillageplayhouse.ca|title=The Village Playhouse - Best of the Arts in North Hastings|work=bancroftvillageplayhouse.ca|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref> a theatre which has been hosting sold out plays, musicals and concerts since the early 1990s. Formerly the Bancroft Community Hall, the historical building was once the local jail, court house and library.\n\n== Transportation ==\n[[Image:Old station Bancroft ON.JPG|thumb|225px|right|Old train station (in 2006)]]\n\nBancroft lies at the intersection of two provincial highways, [[Ontario Highway 28|Highway 28]] and [[Ontario Highway 62|Highway 62]], with several other inroads allowing access to the city.\n\nBancroft is served by the [[Bancroft Airport|Jack Brown Airport]], a [[Transport Canada]] Registered Aerodrome (CNW3), with a 2,200 foot (670 m) crushed gravel runway, located immediately adjoining the town. A small airport, it was named after the man who was reeve at the time and instrumental in its construction.  Currently operated by the [[Bancroft Flying Club]], the Jack Brown Airport is freely available to the general public and frequently referred to as The Bancroft Airport. Due to high terrain near both ends of the runway, pilots typically use a non-standard circuit, following the York River valley through the town for departing from runway 12 or landing on runway 30.\n\nThe [[Central Ontario Railway]] arrived in November 1900 connecting Bancroft with Trenton. The railway went through the Musclow-Greenview road and extended behind Birds Creek through a back trail (which is now used for cyclists and fourwheeling) and continued through the town eventually going further away from the town at the 'Y' road division. The line was closed in 1975 and subsequently removed. The [[Bancroft, Irondale and Ottawa Railway]] connected Bancroft with [[Kinmount]], Ontario. The line was purchased by the Canadian Northern Ontario Railway which became part of the Canadian National Railways in 1918. The line was abandoned in 1960.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nThe old train station in Bancroft served as the Chamber of Commerce and Mineral Museum until it was condemned in 2008. The Chamber, Mineral Museum, and Art Gallery relocated to other sites in the town. In 2011, the old station was moved onto a new foundation;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tedfordhousemovers.com/Tedford_House_Movers/Photo_Albums/Pages/Bancroft_Train_Station.html|title=Bancroft Train station lift|work=tedfordhousemovers.com|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref> it is now restored with an addition at the southern end of the building to house the Bancroft Gem and Mineral Club's museum<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcdougallminerals.com/blog/tag/bancroft-railway-station/|title=Bancroft Railway Station \u00ab  McDougall Minerals|work=mcdougallminerals.com|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref> and a [[caboose]], which is not currently in use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://moosefm.com/chmss/news/use-of-the-caboose/|title=Use of the Caboose - My Bancroft Now|work=moosefm.com|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n\n===Print===\n*Bancroft Times, an independently-owned weekly (5000 copies, paid circulation) founded 1894.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebancrofttimes.ca|title=Bancroft Times|work=thebancrofttimes.ca|accessdate=15 January 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Bancroft This Week]]\n*North Hastings Advertiser\n\n===Radio===\n\n* FM 97.7 - [[CHMS-FM]] (\"[[Vista Broadcast Group|Moose FM]]\"), [[Adult contemporary music|hot adult contemporary]]\n* FM 99.3 - [[CBLA-FM|CBLA-FM-5]], ''(formerly AM 600 [[List of defunct CBC radio transmitters in Canada|CBLV]])'' [[CBC Radio One]];

For industry, it is a prime information source on such subjects as exploration and exploitation of natural resources and on the environmental implications of such activities in the polar regions; on the design of ice-strengthened shipping and selection of sea routes; and on problems of construction and transportation in cold environments. The library also offers an unrivalled resource for the needs of international relations and strategic defence.\n\nThe Picture Library contains a photograph collection from both the Arctic and Antarctic, mainly depicting the history of exploration in the polar regions, including much material from the expeditions of Scott and Shackleton.
