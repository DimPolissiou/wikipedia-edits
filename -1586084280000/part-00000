[[Tommy Lee Jones]] and [[Matthew Fox]] star in lead roles as General [[Douglas MacArthur]] and Brigadier General [[Bonner Fellers]] respectively.\n\n==Plot==\nBrigadier-General [[Bonner Fellers]] is sent to Japan as a part of the [[Occupation of Japan|occupation force]]. He is tasked with arresting Japanese [[war criminal]]s, including Former Prime Minister [[Hideki Tojo]]. Before he departs, he privately orders his Japanese interpreter, Takahashi, to locate his Japanese girlfriend, Aya Shimada. After arresting Tojo, the [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers]], [[General of the Army]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] informs Fellers that [[Hirohito|Emperor Hirohito]] can't be tried as a war criminal. Doing so could lead to a revolt, but the American people want the Emperor to stand trial for Japan's actions. MacArthur gives Fellers ten days to investigate the Emperor. When Takahashi informs Fellers that Aya's Tokyo apartment was bombed, he orders him to investigate her hometown, [[Shizuoka (city)|Shizuoka]].\n\nFellers and his staff compile a list of people who advised Emperor Hirohito when the war started. None of the Japanese who are friendly to the Americans are among them and they resort to Tojo for more information. He gives them the name of [[Fumimaro Konoe]], the former prime minister. Fellers then asks Konoe's if the Emperor was responsible for starting the war and Konoe gives no conclusive evidence, but directs Fellers to [[K\u014dichi Kido]], [[Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan|Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal]]. While Fellers waits to meet with Kido, Takahashi informs Fellers Kido will not show up. Fellers soon after recalls his 1940 visit to Tokyo when he reunited with Aya, then an English teacher. He learns Aya returned to Japan after her father became ill and died. After a banquet at MacArthur's residence, Takahashi informs Fellers that Shizuoka was bombed; Fellers immediately travels there. He is devastated by the damage and orders Takahashi to find a list of the dead.\n\nFellers recalls his visit to Aya's uncle, General Kajima, for help with a paper on the mindset of the Japanese soldier. Kajima insists if the United States and Japan were at war, the Japanese would win because of the Japanese soldier's sense of duty to the Emperor. When Fellers returns to Tokyo, he decides he must interview Teizabur\u014d Sekiya, a member of the Privy Council. Sekiya, like Konoe, does not give any evidence to exonerate the Emperor.\n\nDuring Fellers' interview with Kido, he discusses the time before the Japanese surrender. The Supreme Council's deadlock between those in favour of surrender and those who were not led the Emperor to address the Council. Because there were strong [[Japanese militarism|militarists]] in the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Army]], the Emperor made an [[Jewel Voice Broadcast|audio recording]] of his order to surrender. Before the recording could be broadcast, the militarists attempted [[Ky\u016bj\u014d Incident|a coup]] and attacked the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace|Imperial Palace]]. The Emperor and Kido survived and broadcast the recording. Unfortunately for Fellers, the other witnesses committed suicide and all records were destroyed, leaving him only with Kido's testimony. Kido informs Fellers the Emperor's role is, in actuality, a ceremonial one and the Emperor was influential in ending the war.\n\nFellers decides to visit General Kajima, who has survived the war. Kajima explains to Fellers that the Japanese people are selfless and capable of great sacrifice as well as unspeakable crimes because of their strong devotion to their cultural values. Kajima does not know if the Emperor is guilty, but he notes his role in ending the war. He gives Fellers a box of folded letters written by Aya to Fellers and learns Aya died in an Allied bombing raid.\n\nFellers concludes it cannot be determined whether the Emperor is guilty or innocent, but his role in ending the war was significant. He gives his conclusion to MacArthur, who is displeased because of the lack of conclusive evidence. Fellers argues the Emperor should be exonerated as the Allies agreed they would allow Japan to keep him as the head of state. MacArthur orders Fellers to arrange a meeting between him and the Emperor. Before the Emperor arrives, Fellers informs MacArthur of his role in diverting Allied bombers away from Shizuoka. MacArthur replies because no American lives were lost because of it, he will turn a blind eye. When Emperor Hirohito arrives, he offers himself to be punished rather than Japan. MacArthur states he has no intention of punishing Japan or Hirohito and wishes to discuss Japan's reconstruction.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tommy Lee Jones]] as General of the Army [[Douglas MacArthur]]\n* [[Matthew Fox]] as Brigadier General [[Bonner Fellers]]\n* [[Eriko Hatsune]] as Aya Shimada\n* [[Toshiyuki Nishida]] as General Kajima\n* [[Masatoshi Nakamura]] as Prince [[Fumimaro Konoe]], former Prime Minister\n* [[Kaori Momoi]] as Mrs Kajima\n* Colin Moy as General Richter\n* [[Masayoshi Haneda]] as Takahashi\n* Takatar\u014d Kataoka as [[Hirohito|Emperor Hirohito]]\n* [[Masat\u014d Ibu]] as [[K\u014dichi Kido]], Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal\n* [[Isao Natsuyagi]] as Teizabur\u014d Sekiya, member of the Privy Council\n* [[Sh\u014dhei Hino]] as General [[Hideki Tojo]], former Prime Minister\n\n==Production==\n[[Principal photography]] began shooting in January 2012 in [[New Zealand]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Bettinger|first=Brendan|title=Peter Webber to Direct WWII Love Story EMPEROR; Filming Begins January 2012|url=http://collider.com/peter-webber-emperor/124293/|publisher=Collider.com|accessdate=September 21, 2012|date=November 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film [[Film premiere|premiered]] at the [[2012 Toronto International Film Festival]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Vlessing|first=Etan|title=Toronto 2012: Paul Andrew Williams\u2019 'Song for Marion' to Close 37th Edition|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/toronto-2012-closing-film-paul-andrew-williams-song-for-marion-361770|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=September 21, 2012|date=August 14, 2012}}</ref> and saw a [[limited release]] in the United States on March 8, 2013.

The plot summary is an overview of the film's main events, so avoid minute details such as dialogue, scene-by-scene breakdowns, and technical detail.-->\nThe film, set in 1961, begins in [[London]]. Agent Diarmund Russell urges financially strapped author [[P. L. Travers|Pamela \"P. L.\" Travers]] to travel to [[Los Angeles]] and meet with [[Walt Disney]]. Disney has pursued the [[film rights]] to her ''[[Mary Poppins (book series)|Mary Poppins]]'' stories for twenty years, having promised his daughters to produce a film based on the books. Travers has steadfastly resisted Disney's efforts, fearing what he will do to [[Mary Poppins (character)|her character]]. Having written nothing new and her book royalties dried up, she risks losing her house. Russell reminds her that Disney has agreed to two major stipulations (no animation and unprecedented script approval) before she finally agrees to go.\n\nFlashbacks depict Travers' difficult childhood in [[Allora, Queensland]], [[Australia]], which became the inspiration for much of Mary Poppins. Travers idolized her loving, imaginative father, Travers Robert Goff, but his chronic [[alcoholism]] resulted in his repeated dismissals, strained her parents' marriage, and caused her distressed mother's attempted [[suicide]]. Goff died from [[tuberculosis]] when Travers was seven years old. Prior to his death, her mother's stern, practical sister came to live with the family and later served as Travers's main inspiration for the Mary Poppins character.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Travers is annoyed by what she perceives as the city's unreality and the overly-familiar inhabitants, personified by her friendly limousine driver, Ralph. At the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], Travers meets the creative team that are developing ''Mary Poppins'' for the screen: [[screenwriter]] [[Don DaGradi]], and music composers [[Richard M. Sherman|Richard]] and [[Robert B. Sherman|Robert Sherman]]. She finds their presumptions and casual manners highly improper, a view that she also holds of the jocular Disney.\n\nTravers' working relationship with Disney and his team is difficult from the outset, with her insistence that Mary Poppins is the enemy of sentiment and whimsy. Disney and his people are puzzled by Travers' disdain for fantasy, given the nature of the Mary Poppins story, as well as Travers' own rich imagination. She particularly objects to how the character George Banks, the children's estranged father, is depicted, insisting that he is neither cold nor cruel. Gradually, the team grasp how deeply personal the Mary Poppins stories are to Travers and how many of the characters were inspired by her past.\n\nThe team acknowledges that Travers has valid criticisms and make changes although she becomes increasingly disengaged as painful childhood memories resurface. Seeking to understand what troubles her, Disney invites Travers to [[Disneyland]], which, along with her developing friendship with Ralph, the creative team's revisions to the George Banks character, and the addition of [[Let's Go Fly a Kite|a new song]] and a different ending, help dissolve Travers' opposition. Her creativity reawakens, and she begins collaborating with the team. Soon afterward, however, Travers is enraged to discover an animation sequence has been added. She confronts Disney over his broken promise and returns home.\n\nDisney learns that \"P.L. Travers\" is a [[pen name]], taken from Travers' father's given name. Her real name is Helen Goff, and she is Australian, not English. That gives Disney new insight into Travers, and he follows her to London. Arriving unexpectedly at her home, Disney shares his own less-than-ideal childhood but stresses the healing value of his art. He urges Travers not to let deeply-rooted past disappointments dictate the present. That night, after Disney has left, Travers relents, granting the film rights.\n\nThree years later, in 1964, Travers has begun writing another Mary Poppins story, while ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' is to have its world premiere at [[TCL Chinese Theatre|Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in [[Hollywood]]. Disney has not invited Travers, fearing how she might react with the press watching. Prompted by Russell, Travers shows up unannounced at Disney's office; he reluctantly issues her an invitation. Initially, she watches ''Mary Poppins'' with a lack of enthusiasm, particularly during the animated sequences. She gradually warms to the rest of the film, however, becoming deeply moved by the depiction of George Banks' personal crisis and redemption.<!--This plot summary is in compliance with WP:FILMPLOT's recommended length of 400-700 words; any further plot revisions, especially removing certain details, should be discussed on the talk page first.-->\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Emma Thompson]] as [[P.

The plot summary is an overview of the film's main events, so avoid minute details such as dialogue, scene-by-scene breakdowns, and technical detail.-->\nThe film, set in 1961, begins in [[London]]. Agent Diarmund Russell urges financially strapped author [[P. L. Travers|Pamela \"P. L.\" Travers]] to travel to [[Los Angeles]] and meet with [[Walt Disney]]. Disney has pursued the [[film rights]] to her ''[[Mary Poppins (book series)|Mary Poppins]]'' stories for twenty years, having promised his daughters to produce a film based on the books. Travers has steadfastly resisted Disney's efforts, fearing what he will do to [[Mary Poppins (character)|her character]]. Having written nothing new and her book royalties dried up, she risks losing her house. Russell reminds her that Disney has agreed to two major stipulations (no animation and unprecedented script approval) before she finally agrees to go.\n\nFlashbacks depict Travers' difficult childhood in [[Allora, Queensland]], [[Australia]], which became the inspiration for much of Mary Poppins. Travers idolized her loving, imaginative father, Travers Robert Goff, but his chronic [[alcoholism]] resulted in his repeated dismissals, strained her parents' marriage, and caused her distressed mother's attempted [[suicide]]. Goff died from [[tuberculosis]] when Travers was seven years old. Prior to his death, her mother's stern, practical sister came to live with the family and later served as Travers's main inspiration for the Mary Poppins character.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Travers is annoyed by what she perceives as the city's unreality and the overly-familiar inhabitants, personified by her friendly limousine driver, Ralph. At the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], Travers meets the creative team that are developing ''Mary Poppins'' for the screen: [[screenwriter]] [[Don DaGradi]], and music composers [[Richard M. Sherman|Richard]] and [[Robert B. Sherman|Robert Sherman]]. She finds their presumptions and casual manners highly improper, a view that she also holds of the jocular Disney.\n\nTravers' working relationship with Disney and his team is difficult from the outset, with her insistence that Mary Poppins is the enemy of sentiment and whimsy. Disney and his people are puzzled by Travers' disdain for fantasy, given the nature of the Mary Poppins story, as well as Travers' own rich imagination. She particularly objects to how the character George Banks, the children's estranged father, is depicted, insisting that he is neither cold nor cruel. Gradually, the team grasp how deeply personal the Mary Poppins stories are to Travers and how many of the characters were inspired by her past.\n\nThe team acknowledges that Travers has valid criticisms and make changes although she becomes increasingly disengaged as painful childhood memories resurface. Seeking to understand what troubles her, Disney invites Travers to [[Disneyland]], which, along with her developing friendship with Ralph, the creative team's revisions to the George Banks character, and the addition of [[Let's Go Fly a Kite|a new song]] and a different ending, help dissolve Travers' opposition. Her creativity reawakens, and she begins collaborating with the team. Soon afterward, however, Travers is enraged to discover an animation sequence has been added. She confronts Disney over his broken promise and returns home.\n\nDisney learns that \"P.L. Travers\" is a [[pen name]], taken from Travers' father's given name. Her real name is Helen Goff, and she is Australian, not English. That gives Disney new insight into Travers, and he follows her to London. Arriving unexpectedly at her home, Disney shares his own less-than-ideal childhood but stresses the healing value of his art. He urges Travers not to let deeply-rooted past disappointments dictate the present. That night, after Disney has left, Travers relents, granting the film rights.\n\nThree years later, in 1964, Travers has begun writing another Mary Poppins story, while ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' is to have its world premiere at [[TCL Chinese Theatre|Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in [[Hollywood]]. Disney has not invited Travers, fearing how she might react with the press watching. Prompted by Russell, Travers shows up unannounced at Disney's office; he reluctantly issues her an invitation. Initially, she watches ''Mary Poppins'' with a lack of enthusiasm, particularly during the animated sequences. She gradually warms to the rest of the film, however, becoming deeply moved by the depiction of George Banks' personal crisis and redemption.<!--This plot summary is in compliance with WP:FILMPLOT's recommended length of 400-700 words; any further plot revisions, especially removing certain details, should be discussed on the talk page first.-->\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Emma Thompson]] as [[P.

The film stars [[Sachin Khedekar]], [[Priya Bapat]], Medha Manjrekar, Savita Malpekar and [[Ketaki Mategaonkar]]. Based on a short story by Usha Datar by the same name, the film depicts the tumultuous events in a [[Chitpavan]] [[Brahmin]] family, set around 1930\u20131950 in [[Konkan]]. The film was a commercial success and got critical acclaim for its direction, screenplay by Girish Joshi and also for the performances by its actors, especially Khedekar for his portrayal of Hari Damle as a head of the family.\n\nIn 1989, the short story was adapted into a [[Marathi theatre|Marathi play]] ''Janmagaath'' with actor-director [[Vinay Apte]] playing the lead. Apte had desires to make a film based on it. However, his attempts were not successful. Sachin Khedekar, who went to play the lead in the cinematic adaptation of the story, had seen the play and came across the story again in 2007. Khedekar requested Girish Joshi to complete the [[Film adaptation#Adaptation of films|adapted screenplay]] and together approached Manjrekar in 2009 to make a film on the story. ''Kaksparsh''{{`s}} shooting was completed in 26 days &ndash; from 5 to 30 December 2011 and was released on 4 May 2012, on the occasion of centenary of [[Indian Cinema]].\n\nThe film won several awards on release including Best Film award at [[Maharashtra State Film Awards]], [[MICTA]], and 11th [[Pune International Film Festival]]. It is also the first Marathi film to have a home media release in [[Blu-ray]]. With the success of ''Kaksparsh'', a [[Hindi]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] remake of ''Kaksparsh'' is also being directed by Mahesh Manjrekar with [[Arvind Swamy]] and Tisca Chopra as the leads.\n\n== Plot ==\nHari Damle ([[Sachin Khedekar]]), head of a [[Chitpavan]] [[Bramhin]] family, lives in the village Torgaon in [[Konkan]] with his wife Tara (Medha Manjrekar), their three children, his younger brother Mahadev (Abhijit Kelkar), and his widowed aunt, Namu Aatya (Savita Malpekar). Hari arranges the marriage of Mahadev with a pre-pubescent girl, Durga ([[Ketaki Mategaonkar]]), renamed as Uma after marriage. However, Mahadev dies before the consummation of the marriage. Hari performs death rituals ([[\u015ar\u0101ddha]]) for Mahadev but crows (symbolic of the spirit of the deceased in Hinduism) refuse to touch the offerings. Hari mumbles something while offering food after which crow touches the offerings.\n\nThe Brahmin community in the village now expects widow Uma to have her head shaved (a ritual). Hari opposes and does not allow any rituals to be performed for her as a widow. Hari stands behind Uma in all her difficulties which raise doubts about his intentions, including that by his wife, Tara. Years later, when Tara is diagnosed of a terminal disease, the now grown-up Uma (now played by [[Priya Bapat]]) takes charge of the household. Before Tara dies, she realises her mistakes and requests Hari to marry Uma which he readily refuses.\n\nIn the meantime, Hari gets his son Sankarshan ([[Saksham Kulkarni]]) married. Once Hari finds Uma sitting outside the room of the newly married couple, listening to their playful banter. Disgusted by Uma's behaviour, Hari starts avoiding her. Upset by this behaviour, Uma tries to talk her heart out to Hari's friend Balwant (Sanjay Khapre) and requests him to find out the reason. Coincidentally, Hari overhears this and severs his relations with Balwant. Unaware of the reason for Hari's changed behaviour, Uma starts staying aloof, while her health starts degrading. Worried Sankarshan requests his sister Shanti ([[Manava Naik]]) to talk to Uma. Frustrated and unknowing of what loss she had throughout her life, Uma opens her heart but situation raises more questions about her relation with Hari.\n\nUma decides to go on a [[Fasting#Hinduism|fast]] and relents to none of the family member's request to quit. Hari, left with no other option, explains his behaviour. Hari reveals to Uma that when he was performing death rituals for Mahadev and offerings were not accepted by crow for a long time, he took a vow that he would not let any other man touch Uma. Thus, he did not allow practised rituals of shaving her head to be performed and also declined Tara's request of their marriage. When he learned through Tara that Uma has started loving him, he stopped talking to her, in spite of his love towards Uma.\n\nHe eventually accepts that he loves Uma and would marry her, breaking his vow. Knowing the truth, Uma forgives Hari and agrees to the proposal. Hari fetches [[Mangala sutra]] but finds out that Uma is dead. He realises that Uma has sacrificed her life for his love where she did not want Hari to break his vow.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{col-float}}\n* [[Sachin Khedekar]] as Hari Dada Damle\n* [[Priya Bapat]] as Uma Damle\n* Abhijit Kelkar as Mahadev Damle, Hari's younger brother\n* Savita Malpekar as Namu Aatya, Hari's widow aunt\n* Sanjat Khapre as Balwant Phadke\n* [[Vaibhav Mangle]] as Upadhyay\n{{col-float-break}}\n* [[Medha Manjrekar]] as Tara Damle, Hari's wife\n* [[Ketaki Mategaonkar]] as Young Uma/Durga\n* [[Saksham Kulkarni]] as Sankarshan Damle, Hari-Tara's son\n* [[Manava Naik]] as Shanti, Hari-Tara's daughter\n* Saiee Manjrekar as Kushi, Hari-Tara's daughter\n* Kishor Raorane as Janu\n{{col-float-end}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Mahesh-Medha Manjrekar.jpg|thumb|right|Mahesh Manjrekar with his wife, Medha]]\n\nBased on a short story ''Kaksparsh'' written by Usha Datar, a [[Marathi theatre|Marathi play]] ''Janmagaath'' premiered on 16 December 1989.

drama]] film directed by [[Mahesh Manjrekar]] and produced by Aniruddha Deshpande and Medha Manjrekar. The film stars [[Sachin Khedekar]], [[Priya Bapat]], Medha Manjrekar, Savita Malpekar and [[Ketaki Mategaonkar]]. Based on a short story by Usha Datar by the same name, the film depicts the tumultuous events in a [[Chitpavan]] [[Brahmin]] family, set around 1930\u20131950 in [[Konkan]]. The film was a commercial success and got critical acclaim for its direction, screenplay by Girish Joshi and also for the performances by its actors, especially Khedekar for his portrayal of Hari Damle as a head of the family.\n\nIn 1989, the short story was adapted into a [[Marathi theatre|Marathi play]] ''Janmagaath'' with actor-director [[Vinay Apte]] playing the lead. Apte had desires to make a film based on it. However, his attempts were not successful. Sachin Khedekar, who went to play the lead in the cinematic adaptation of the story, had seen the play and came across the story again in 2007. Khedekar requested Girish Joshi to complete the [[Film adaptation#Adaptation of films|adapted screenplay]] and together approached Manjrekar in 2009 to make a film on the story. ''Kaksparsh''{{`s}} shooting was completed in 26 days &ndash; from 5 to 30 December 2011 and was released on 4 May 2012, on the occasion of centenary of [[Indian Cinema]].\n\nThe film won several awards on release including Best Film award at [[Maharashtra State Film Awards]], [[MICTA]], and 11th [[Pune International Film Festival]]. It is also the first Marathi film to have a home media release in [[Blu-ray]]. With the success of ''Kaksparsh'', a [[Hindi]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] remake of ''Kaksparsh'' is also being directed by Mahesh Manjrekar with [[Arvind Swamy]] and Tisca Chopra as the leads.\n\n== Plot ==\nHari Damle ([[Sachin Khedekar]]), head of a [[Chitpavan]] [[Bramhin]] family, lives in the village Torgaon in [[Konkan]] with his wife Tara (Medha Manjrekar), their three children, his younger brother Mahadev (Abhijit Kelkar), and his widowed aunt, Namu Aatya (Savita Malpekar). Hari arranges the marriage of Mahadev with a pre-pubescent girl, Durga ([[Ketaki Mategaonkar]]), renamed as Uma after marriage. However, Mahadev dies before the consummation of the marriage. Hari performs death rituals ([[\u015ar\u0101ddha]]) for Mahadev but crows (symbolic of the spirit of the deceased in Hinduism) refuse to touch the offerings. Hari mumbles something while offering food after which crow touches the offerings.\n\nThe Brahmin community in the village now expects widow Uma to have her head shaved (a ritual). Hari opposes and does not allow any rituals to be performed for her as a widow. Hari stands behind Uma in all her difficulties which raise doubts about his intentions, including that by his wife, Tara. Years later, when Tara is diagnosed of a terminal disease, the now grown-up Uma (now played by [[Priya Bapat]]) takes charge of the household. Before Tara dies, she realises her mistakes and requests Hari to marry Uma which he readily refuses.\n\nIn the meantime, Hari gets his son Sankarshan ([[Saksham Kulkarni]]) married. Once Hari finds Uma sitting outside the room of the newly married couple, listening to their playful banter. Disgusted by Uma's behaviour, Hari starts avoiding her. Upset by this behaviour, Uma tries to talk her heart out to Hari's friend Balwant (Sanjay Khapre) and requests him to find out the reason. Coincidentally, Hari overhears this and severs his relations with Balwant. Unaware of the reason for Hari's changed behaviour, Uma starts staying aloof, while her health starts degrading. Worried Sankarshan requests his sister Shanti ([[Manava Naik]]) to talk to Uma. Frustrated and unknowing of what loss she had throughout her life, Uma opens her heart but situation raises more questions about her relation with Hari.\n\nUma decides to go on a [[Fasting#Hinduism|fast]] and relents to none of the family member's request to quit. Hari, left with no other option, explains his behaviour. Hari reveals to Uma that when he was performing death rituals for Mahadev and offerings were not accepted by crow for a long time, he took a vow that he would not let any other man touch Uma. Thus, he did not allow practised rituals of shaving her head to be performed and also declined Tara's request of their marriage. When he learned through Tara that Uma has started loving him, he stopped talking to her, in spite of his love towards Uma.\n\nHe eventually accepts that he loves Uma and would marry her, breaking his vow. Knowing the truth, Uma forgives Hari and agrees to the proposal. Hari fetches [[Mangala sutra]] but finds out that Uma is dead. He realises that Uma has sacrificed her life for his love where she did not want Hari to break his vow.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{col-float}}\n* [[Sachin Khedekar]] as Hari Dada Damle\n* [[Priya Bapat]] as Uma Damle\n* Abhijit Kelkar as Mahadev Damle, Hari's younger brother\n* Savita Malpekar as Namu Aatya, Hari's widow aunt\n* Sanjat Khapre as Balwant Phadke\n* [[Vaibhav Mangle]] as Upadhyay\n{{col-float-break}}\n* [[Medha Manjrekar]] as Tara Damle, Hari's wife\n* [[Ketaki Mategaonkar]] as Young Uma/Durga\n* [[Saksham Kulkarni]] as Sankarshan Damle, Hari-Tara's son\n* [[Manava Naik]] as Shanti, Hari-Tara's daughter\n* Saiee Manjrekar as Kushi, Hari-Tara's daughter\n* Kishor Raorane as Janu\n{{col-float-end}}\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Mahesh-Medha Manjrekar.jpg|thumb|right|Mahesh Manjrekar with his wife, Medha]]\n\nBased on a short story ''Kaksparsh'' written by Usha Datar, a [[Marathi theatre|Marathi play]] ''Janmagaath'' premiered on 16 December 1989.

Filmed in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], it premiered on March 3, 2013, in Canada. In January 2019, it was announced that the 20-episode sixth season, which was ordered on September 12, 2017, ahead of its fifth-season premiere, would be the final season of the series. The sixth season premiered on December 4, 2019. A sequel series, titled ''Vikings: Valhalla'', is in development for [[Netflix]].<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n''Vikings'' is inspired by the [[saga]]s of [[Vikings|Viking]] [[Ragnar Lodbrok|Ragnar Lothbrok]], one of the best-known legendary [[Norse mythology|Norse]] heroes and notorious as the scourge of [[Anglo-Saxon England|England]] and [[West Francia|France]]. The show portrays Ragnar as a farmer who rises to fame by successful raids into England, and eventually becomes a [[Scandinavia]]n King, with the support of his family and fellow warriors. In the later seasons, the series follows the fortunes of his sons and their adventures in England, Scandinavia and the Mediterranean.\n\n==Premise==\nThe series is inspired by the tales of the [[Norsemen]] of [[early medieval]] [[Scandinavia]]. It broadly follows the exploits of the legendary Viking chieftain [[Ragnar Lodbrok|Ragnar Lothbrok]] and his crew, family and descendants, as notably laid down in the 13th-century sagas ''[[Ragnars saga Lo\u00f0br\u00f3kar]]'' and ''[[Ragnarssona \u00fe\u00e1ttr]]'', as well as in [[Saxo Grammaticus]]'s 12th-century work ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''. Norse [[legendary sagas]] were partially fictional tales based in the Norse [[oral tradition]], written down about 200 to 400 years after the events they describe. Further inspiration is taken from historical sources of the period, such as records of the Viking raid on [[Lindisfarne]] depicted in the second episode, or [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]]'s 10th-century account of the [[Varangians]]. The series begins at the start of the [[Viking Age]], marked by the Lindisfarne raid in 793.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Vikings characters}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Travis Fimmel]] as [[List of Vikings characters#Ragnar Lothbrok|Ragnar Lothbrok]] (seasons 1\u20134)\n* [[Katheryn Winnick]] as [[List of Vikings characters#Lagertha|Lagertha]]\n* [[Clive Standen]] as [[List of Vikings characters#Rollo|Rollo]] (seasons 1\u20134;

Filmed in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], it premiered on March 3, 2013, in Canada. In January 2019, it was announced that the 20-episode sixth season, which was ordered on September 12, 2017, ahead of its fifth-season premiere, would be the final season of the series. The sixth season premiered on December 4, 2019. A sequel series, titled ''Vikings: Valhalla'', is in development for [[Netflix]].<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n''Vikings'' is inspired by the [[saga]]s of [[Vikings|Viking]] [[Ragnar Lodbrok|Ragnar Lothbrok]], one of the best-known legendary [[Norse mythology|Norse]] heroes and notorious as the scourge of [[Anglo-Saxon England|England]] and [[West Francia|France]]. The show portrays Ragnar as a farmer who rises to fame by successful raids into England, and eventually becomes a [[Scandinavia]]n King, with the support of his family and fellow warriors. In the later seasons, the series follows the fortunes of his sons and their adventures in England, Scandinavia and the Mediterranean.\n\n==Premise==\nThe series is inspired by the tales of the [[Norsemen]] of [[early medieval]] [[Scandinavia]]. It broadly follows the exploits of the legendary Viking chieftain [[Ragnar Lodbrok|Ragnar Lothbrok]] and his crew, family and descendants, as notably laid down in the 13th-century sagas ''[[Ragnars saga Lo\u00f0br\u00f3kar]]'' and ''[[Ragnarssona \u00fe\u00e1ttr]]'', as well as in [[Saxo Grammaticus]]'s 12th-century work ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''. Norse [[legendary sagas]] were partially fictional tales based in the Norse [[oral tradition]], written down about 200 to 400 years after the events they describe. Further inspiration is taken from historical sources of the period, such as records of the Viking raid on [[Lindisfarne]] depicted in the second episode, or [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]]'s 10th-century account of the [[Varangians]]. The series begins at the start of the [[Viking Age]], marked by the Lindisfarne raid in 793.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Vikings characters}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Travis Fimmel]] as [[List of Vikings characters#Ragnar Lothbrok|Ragnar Lothbrok]] (seasons 1\u20134)\n* [[Katheryn Winnick]] as [[List of Vikings characters#Lagertha|Lagertha]]\n* [[Clive Standen]] as [[List of Vikings characters#Rollo|Rollo]] (seasons 1\u20134;
