While atmospheric brown clouds partially offset the warming due from carbon dioxide, their effect on agriculture has been less certain. A statistical rice model couple to a regional climate model has shown that reductions of both carbon dioxide and atmospheric brown clouds will increase crop yield.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Auffhammer| first = M. | year = 2006 |title = Integrated model shows that atmospheric brown clouds and greenhouse gases have reduced rice harvests in India | journal = Proc.

Ramanathan writes that there are several [[Tipping point (climatology)|tipping points]] in the climate system, and that they do not all occur at the same temperature threshold; the tipping point for the arctic summer sea ice is likely to be smaller than that for the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. While the planet has seen an observed warming of 0.6&nbsp;\u00b0C since pre-industrial times, it has already most likely committed itself to 2.4&nbsp;\u00b0C (1.4&nbsp;\u00b0C to 4.3&nbsp;\u00b0C) of warming.

While the planet has seen an observed warming of 0.6&nbsp;\u00b0C since pre-industrial times, it has already most likely committed itself to 2.4&nbsp;\u00b0C (1.4&nbsp;\u00b0C to 4.3&nbsp;\u00b0C) of warming.

This is true despite the fact that crimes against the nation and people, which foreigners are usually accused of, should, according to the [[Criminal Procedure Law of North Korea]], be tried at local-level courts first. The decision to take foreigners to the Supreme Court seems to have been taken to make such trials speedy. Trials of foreigners have involved [[Americans detained in North Korea]] such as [[Aijalon Gomes]], [[Euna Lee]], [[Laura Ling]], and [[Kenneth Bae]].{{sfn|Do et al.|2015|p=158}}\n\nThe Supreme Court also arbitrates matters involving the non-fulfillment of contracts between state enterprises and cases involving injuries and compensation demands. These administrative decisions always reflect party policies.{{sfn|Arrigoni|1994|p=269}}\n\nThe Supreme Procurator's Office routinely investigates the Supreme Court's decisions.
