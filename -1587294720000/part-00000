Most Marder Is were built on the base of the [[Lorraine 37L|''Tracteur Blind\u00e9'' 37L (Lorraine)]], a French artillery tractor/[[armoured personnel carrier]] of which the Germans had acquired more than three hundred after the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]] in 1940.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-297-1701-29, Im Westen, Panzer \"Marder I\".jpg|thumb|left|Marder I, 1943]]\nFrom the early stages of [[Operation Barbarossa]] the [[Wehrmacht]] became aware that their ability to combat some of the Soviet tanks was inadequate. The lighter tanks then in general service, such as the [[Panzer II]] and the Czech built [[38(t)]], were under-armoured and did not mount an adequate gun to deal with the newer Soviet tanks. In addition, the standard towed anti-tank gun of the Wehrmacht, the 37&nbsp;mm ''[[Pak 36]]'', was both difficult to get into position quickly and lacked the ability to penetrate the heavy sloped armour of the new Soviet tanks.  What was needed was a more powerful anti-tank gun that was mobile. The Germans possessed such a gun in the 75&nbsp;mm [[PaK 40]]. They also had come into possession of a large number of captured Soviet [[76-mm divisional gun M1936 (F-22)|76 mm F-22 Model 1936]] divisional field guns. The Germans had experience in taking the chassis of an under-gunned tank to provide mobility to a heavier gun. The ''[[Panzerj\u00e4ger I]]'' is such an example, where the turret was removed for an open conversion to allow the gunners the necessary room to operate the gun.\n\nWith the shock of having units overrun by new Soviet [[T-34]]s and [[Kliment Voroshilov tank|KV-1]]s, the need for a heavier-gunned German tank became urgent.  As an interim solution, it was decided to use captured French vehicles such as the [[Lorraine 37L|Lorraine]], and less effective Wehrmacht tanks such as the Panzer II and 38(t) as the basis for makeshift tank destroyers. The result was the ''Marder'' series, comprising the Marder I, [[Marder II]], and [[Marder III]] respectively.  These vehicles provided mobility to either the captured Soviet [[7.62 cm Pak 36(r)]] gun or in later versions the German 75&nbsp;mm [[PaK 40]] anti-tank gun. Due to the weight and space constraints of the small chassis, the ''Marder'' series were not fully armored. Thin upper armor protection was provided only for the front and sides against shrapnel and small arms only. All ''Marder'' series had open tops. Some were issued with canvas covers to protect the crew from the elements. The Marder series were not a proper Panzerj\u00e4ger that could exchange fire with enemy tanks.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-300-1865-05, Frankreich, Rommel bei 21. Pz.Div..jpg|left|thumb|Marder I of the 21st Panzer in Normandy, converted from Hotchkiss, 1944.]]\nThe ''Marder'' I was developed in May 1942 by Major [[Alfred Becker]].  It carried the 75&nbsp;mm PaK 40 anti-tank gun on a Lorraine [[chassis]].  As the gun was relatively large, the original crew compartment superstructure was removed to create the space needed to work the gun.  This was done at [[Alfred Becker#Paris Baustokommando Becker|Baustokommando Becker]].  The gun was then mounted atop the chassis. [[Alkett]], working in conjunction with Becker, produced the angled armour shielding for the crew compartment.<ref name=\"Restayn\">Restayn, Jean ''Kommando Becker''. German Military Magazine (in German)(see External links)</ref> The shielding was relatively light, and was open from above.  The shielding provided the crew with protection from blast and [[small arms]] fire, but was not intended to stop armour piercing rounds. The vehicle's primary function was to provide mobility to the anti-tank gun. It was not intended as a replacement for a tank.\n\nBetween July and August 1942, 170 ''Marder'' I's were built on the Lorraine chassis.  Later, several other French and Polish tanks were used as the conversion base for the ''Marder''&nbsp;I, including the [[Hotchkiss H35|Hotchkiss H39]] and [[FCM 36]]. These conversions were also completed at Baustokommando Becker, though fewer of these were built. The Marder Is initially served in infantry divisions on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] and met with good success. They later made up a significant component of the armoured fighting vehicles of the reformed [[21st Panzer Division]] in Normandy.\n\n==Combat history==\n{{citation style|section|date=December 2018}}\nThe first Lorraine-based ''Marder'' I vehicles were sent to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] in 1942 to serve in the ''Panzerj\u00e4ger'' (tank destroyer) units of infantry divisions.\n\nThis is a list of Infantry Divisions operating on the Eastern Front known to have used ''Marder'' I's and the estimated time frame they were used\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The season premiered on June 25, 2019 and concluded on September 25, 2019. The 40-episode season was broadcast on [[CBS]] in the United States and [[Global Television Network|Global]] in [[Canada]]. The show chronicles a group of contestants, known as HouseGuests, as they compete to be the last competitor remaining to win a grand prize of [[USD|$]]500,000. Over the course of the season the HouseGuests participated in a series of competitions to win power and safety to avoid being eliminated, referred to as \"evicted\". In the finale episode, previous nine evicted HouseGuests, known as the Jury, voted on who they thought should win the game out of the last two HouseGuests remaining. The HouseGuest who received the most votes would be declared the winner. Prior to the live finale a public vote is held to determine who would win the title America's Favorite HouseGuest and a prize of $25,000. Jackson Michie was declared the winner of the season in a 6\u20133 jury vote over Holly Allen while Nicole Anthony won the public vote for America's Favorite HouseGuest. CBS confirmed on September 5, 2019 that the series was renewed for a twenty-second season.\n\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n== Format ==\n{{Further|Big Brother (U.S.)#Format}}\n''Big Brother'' depicts a group of contestants, known as HouseGuests, that live inside a custom-built two story house outfitted with 94 HD cameras and over 113 microphones recording their every move 24 hours a day. The HouseGuests are sequestered in the ''Big Brother House'' with no contact with the outside world. During their stay the HouseGuests share their thoughts on events and other houseguests inside a private room referred to as the Diary Room.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nickiswift.com/108051/untold-truth-big-brother/ |title=The untold truth of Big Brother |last=Bianco |first=Julia |website=NickiSwift.com |language=en-US |access-date=October 5, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/big-brother-oral-history_n_55c511cee4b0f1cbf1e51830 |title=But First: An Oral History Of 'Big Brother' |last=Jacobs |first=Matthew |date=August 13, 2013 |website=HuffPost |language=en |access-date=October 5, 2019}}{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/big-brother-oral-history_n_55c511cee4b0f1cbf1e51830 |title=But First: An Oral History Of 'Big Brother' |last=Jacobs |first=Matthew |date=August 13, 2013 |website=HuffPost |language=en |access-date=October 5, 2019}}</ref> Each week, the HouseGuests compete in several competitions in order to win power and safety inside the house. At the start of each week, the HouseGuests compete in the Head of Household (abbreviated as \"HoH\") competition. The winner of the HoH competition is immune from eviction and will select two HouseGuests to be nominated for eviction. Then six HouseGuests are selected to compete in the Power of Veto (abbreviated as \"PoV\") competition: the reigning HoH and the nominees are guaranteed to play with the remaining slots being given to other HouseGuests selected by random draw. The winner of the PoV competition wins the right to either revoke the nomination of one of the nominated HouseGuests or leave them as is. If the veto winner uses this power, the HoH must immediately nominate another HouseGuest for eviction. The PoV winner is also immune from being named as the replacement nominee. \n\nOn eviction night, all HouseGuests must vote to evict one of the nominees. The Head of Household and the nominees are not allowed to vote.  This compulsory vote is conducted in the privacy of the Diary Room. In the event of a tie the Head of Household will cast the tie-breaking vote in front of all the HouseGuests in the living room. The nominee with the most votes is evicted from the house. The last nine evicted HouseGuests, referred to as the Jury, are sequestered in a separate house following their eviction and ultimately decide the winner of the season. The Jury are not allowed  to watch the show except for competitions and ceremonies that include all of the remaining HouseGuests. They are not shown any Diary Room interviews or any footage that may include strategy or details regarding nominations. The viewing public is able to award an additional prize of $25,000 to their favorite HouseGuest of the season. All evicted HouseGuests are eligible to win this award except for those who either voluntary leave or forcibly removed for rule-breaking.\n\n== HouseGuests ==\n{{main|List of Big Brother (American TV series) houseguests}}\n[[File:Big_Brother_21_Cast_Photo.jpg|thumb|500px|right|<center>'''The cast of the twenty-first season of ''Big Brother'''''</center><hr />'''Top:''' Jackson, Jessica, Cliff, Sam, and Nick<hr />'''Middle:''' Holly, Kemi, Ovi, Isabella, Nicole, Kathryn, Christie, and Tommy<hr />'''Bottom:'''Jack, Analyse, and David]]\n\nOn June 10, 2019, CBS reported that the cast would be revealed on June 17, 2019 on ''Big Brother'' live feeds to viewers with a [[CBS All Access]] subscription.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/official-heres-season-21-cast-220000959.html|title=It's Official: Here's When the Season 21 Cast of Big Brother Will Be Revealed|last=Jean-Philippe|first=McKenzie|date=June 10, 2019|accessdate=June 10, 2019|work=[[Yahoo!

The HouseGuest to get the most questions correct won the final part. Michie won with 8 points, automatically nominating Holly alongside Nicole.\nOn Day 99, by Michie's sole vote, Nicole was evicted and became the ninth and final jury member. The jury, then joined by Nicole, questioned Michie and Holly as to why they should win.

The season premiered on June 25, 2019 and concluded on September 25, 2019. The 40-episode season was broadcast on [[CBS]] in the United States and [[Global Television Network|Global]] in [[Canada]]. The show chronicles a group of contestants, known as HouseGuests, as they compete to be the last competitor remaining to win a grand prize of [[USD|$]]500,000. Over the course of the season the HouseGuests participated in a series of competitions to win power and safety to avoid being eliminated, referred to as \"evicted\". In the finale episode, previous nine evicted HouseGuests, known as the Jury, voted on who they thought should win the game out of the last two HouseGuests remaining. The HouseGuest who received the most votes would be declared the winner. Prior to the live finale a public vote is held to determine who would win the title America's Favorite HouseGuest and a prize of $25,000. Jackson Michie was declared the winner of the season in a 6\u20133 jury vote over Holly Allen while Nicole Anthony won the public vote for America's Favorite HouseGuest. CBS confirmed on September 5, 2019 that the series was renewed for a twenty-second season.\n\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n== Format ==\n{{Further|Big Brother (U.S.)#Format}}\n''Big Brother'' depicts a group of contestants, known as HouseGuests, that live inside a custom-built two story house outfitted with 94 HD cameras and over 113 microphones recording their every move 24 hours a day. The HouseGuests are sequestered in the ''Big Brother House'' with no contact with the outside world. During their stay the HouseGuests share their thoughts on events and other houseguests inside a private room referred to as the Diary Room.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nickiswift.com/108051/untold-truth-big-brother/ |title=The untold truth of Big Brother |last=Bianco |first=Julia |website=NickiSwift.com |language=en-US |access-date=October 5, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/big-brother-oral-history_n_55c511cee4b0f1cbf1e51830 |title=But First: An Oral History Of 'Big Brother' |last=Jacobs |first=Matthew |date=August 13, 2013 |website=HuffPost |language=en |access-date=October 5, 2019}}{{Cite web |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/big-brother-oral-history_n_55c511cee4b0f1cbf1e51830 |title=But First: An Oral History Of 'Big Brother' |last=Jacobs |first=Matthew |date=August 13, 2013 |website=HuffPost |language=en |access-date=October 5, 2019}}</ref> Each week, the HouseGuests compete in several competitions in order to win power and safety inside the house. At the start of each week, the HouseGuests compete in the Head of Household (abbreviated as \"HoH\") competition. The winner of the HoH competition is immune from eviction and will select two HouseGuests to be nominated for eviction. Then six HouseGuests are selected to compete in the Power of Veto (abbreviated as \"PoV\") competition: the reigning HoH and the nominees are guaranteed to play with the remaining slots being given to other HouseGuests selected by random draw. The winner of the PoV competition wins the right to either revoke the nomination of one of the nominated HouseGuests or leave them as is. If the veto winner uses this power, the HoH must immediately nominate another HouseGuest for eviction. The PoV winner is also immune from being named as the replacement nominee. \n\nOn eviction night, all HouseGuests must vote to evict one of the nominees. The Head of Household and the nominees are not allowed to vote.  This compulsory vote is conducted in the privacy of the Diary Room. In the event of a tie the Head of Household will cast the tie-breaking vote in front of all the HouseGuests in the living room. The nominee with the most votes is evicted from the house. The last nine evicted HouseGuests, referred to as the Jury, are sequestered in a separate house following their eviction and ultimately decide the winner of the season. The Jury are not allowed  to watch the show except for competitions and ceremonies that include all of the remaining HouseGuests. They are not shown any Diary Room interviews or any footage that may include strategy or details regarding nominations. The viewing public is able to award an additional prize of $25,000 to their favorite HouseGuest of the season. All evicted HouseGuests are eligible to win this award except for those who either voluntary leave or forcibly removed for rule-breaking.\n\n== HouseGuests ==\n{{main|List of Big Brother (American TV series) houseguests}}\n[[File:Big_Brother_21_Cast_Photo.jpg|thumb|500px|right|<center>'''The cast of the twenty-first season of ''Big Brother'''''</center><hr />'''Top:''' Jackson, Jessica, Cliff, Sam, and Nick<hr />'''Middle:''' Holly, Kemi, Ovi, Isabella, Nicole, Kathryn, Christie, and Tommy<hr />'''Bottom:'''Jack, Analyse, and David]]\n\nOn June 10, 2019, CBS reported that the cast would be revealed on June 17, 2019 on ''Big Brother'' live feeds to viewers with a [[CBS All Access]] subscription.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/official-heres-season-21-cast-220000959.html|title=It's Official: Here's When the Season 21 Cast of Big Brother Will Be Revealed|last=Jean-Philippe|first=McKenzie|date=June 10, 2019|accessdate=June 10, 2019|work=[[Yahoo!

The HouseGuests were told that the Camp Director would receive Immunity for the first week but would have to put the games of other HouseGuests in jeopardy. Michie was elected as Camp Director. He was tasked with \"banishing\" four HouseGuests, who would compete to stay in the house. Michie chose to banish Cliff, David, Jessica and Kemi. David lost the competition. As he was immune, Michie was ineligible to compete in the first Head of Household Competition.\n* {{note|2|Note 2}}: {{Color box|#87CEFA|border=darkgray}} On Day 15, ''Camp Comeback'' was introduced. David returned to the house from sequester and the next three evicted HouseGuests (Ovi, Kemi and Cliff) remained in the house after getting voted out of the game.

Christie's nomination did not require a replacement if the veto was used to save her.\n* {{note|4|Note 4}}: Week 9 was ''Prank Week'' and featured the ''America's Prankster'' power. America voted for Nick to be ''America's Prankster'' and took half of Holly's Head of Household power by anonymously nominating one HouseGuest at the Nomination Ceremony (denoted in '''bold''') and naming a replacement nominee if the Power of Veto is used on his nominee. Nick was not given immunity with his power and could be nominated by Holly.\n* {{note|5|Note 5}}: This week was a double eviction week. Following Jessica's eviction, the remaining HouseGuests played a week's worth of games\u2014including HoH and Veto competitions and Nomination, Veto and Eviction ceremonies\u2014during the remainder of the live show, culminating in a second eviction for the week.\n* {{note|6|Note 6}}: During the finale, the Jury members voted for which finalist should win Big Brother.\n</small>\n\n== Reception ==\n''Big Brother 21'' was criticized negatively by critics and fans due to the HouseGuests' discriminatory tendencies.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dehnart |first1=Andy |title=Big Brother 21 racism and awfulness: an update |url=https://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/2019/07/big-brother-21-racism-update-bb21/ |website=realityblurred.com |publisher=Reality Blurred |accessdate=25 October 2019 |date=25 July 2019}}</ref> Professor of African American studies and the UCLA Dean of Social Sciences, Darnell Hunt, stated, \"Race is the central axis of social relationships.

It won [[Filmfare Award for Best Debut Director|Best Debut Director]] for Kaushik.\n\n==Plot==\nThe plot is based on the Indian folk legend about a female spirit/witch who abducts men at night when they are alone and only leaves their clothes behind. The residents of a town named [[Chanderi]] believe in the spirit of an angry woman, referred to as \"[[wikt:\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0940|Stree]]\", who stalks men and whisks them away during the four days of a religious festival every year, causing many disappearances. To protect the residents, \"O Stree, come tomorrow\" is written in Hindi with bat's blood on the entrances of all homes and men are advised to not roam alone after 10 pm during the festive season, and move in groups for safety - a parallel of instructions women are usually told to follow for their own safety.\n\nVicky ([[Rajkummar Rao]]), a ladies' tailor in [[Chanderi]], mysteriously encounters an outlandish and charming woman ([[Shraddha Kapoor]]) who only comes to the town during the annual Durga pooja season and falls in love with her at first sight. She asks him to stitch her a [[lahenga]]. Her frequent disappearances, her shopping list including peculiar items such as a lizard's tail, white cat's furr, flowers of [[Datura]], meat, brandy and suchlike presumed to be ingredients for black magic and the fact that she is not seen by anybody except Vicky, makes his friend Bittu ([[Aparshakti Khurana]]) suspicious, and he starts believing that she could be Stree. After one of his friends, Janna (Abhishek Banerjee), is kidnapped by Stree, Vicky grows suspicious of the woman as well. He confronts her on which she disappears yet again. \n\nThey decide to research the history of the town and the myth of Stree, to find a way to save their friend and ask the town's librarian Rudra Bhaiya ([[Pankaj Tripathi]]) for help, who is also a [[Paranormal|paranologist]]. They come across a partially torn book in his library which mentions Stree's story and an old fort. Vicky, Bittu and Rudra visit the old fort, which Stree is supposedly inhabiting, to find Janna. Stree drives away Bittu and Rudra and is about to attack Vicky but does not, as she senses the feeling of love and respect in his eyes. She is then driven away by the mysterious woman. The woman tells Vicky and his friends that she has been trying to defeat 'Stree' for the last three years after losing someone close to her, this been the reason of her coming during the festival season when Stree haunts the town. This clarifies that The Woman & Stree are two different persons. Where the Woman is a witch who wants to defeat Stree. Stree releases Janna as requested by Vicky, but he starts having sporadic violent episodes. More men go missing after a possessed Janna, under Stree's control, erases the word \"Tomorrow\" from the protective phrases outside everyone's homes, leaving it as \"O Stree, come\"; an invitation.\n\nVicky, Bittu, Rudra and the woman meet the book's author Shankar Shastri ([[Vijay Raaz]]) to find a permanent solution to save the town, who informs them that Stree had once been an extremely beautiful courtesan that every man in town desired. At last she found a man who truly loved her and wanted to marry her, but on their wedding night, Stree and her husband were killed by the town's jealous men. Her spirit has ever since been searching for her true love and also seeks revenge on the town by aiming to abduct every last man in it. Shastri tells them of a prophecy pointing to a saviour and Vicky surprisingly appears to have all the characteristics describing the saviour which is also inclusive of the fact that his mother too was a courtesan who fell in love with his father and married, a story similar to Stree's, but with a fortunate end. Vicky struggles with taking on the truth, confronts his father but then feels grateful for his father's affection and efforts, and decides to save his town which accepted him and didn't denounce him. The friends and the woman make a trap to kill Stree but Vicky realizes that Stree only desires love and respect. Instead of killing her, the mysterious woman suggests Vicky simply cut her long braid - the source of her powers - so that she will be rendered powerless. He does so, and Stree vanishes. The mysterious woman leaves the city the next day and Vicky bids her farewell, forgetting to ask her name all this time. On the bus, the woman merges Stree's braid with her own hair and then vanishes from the bus, implying that she is a witch who has been after Stree\u2019s powers from the braid.\n\nStree visits Chanderi again the following year and finds her own statue at the town entrance with a new phrase - \"O Stree, protect us\" - thus giving her respect, and she does not enter Chanderi.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Shraddha Kapoor]] as the unknown/mysterious woman.\n* [[Rajkummar Rao]] as Vicky, a ladies tailor\n* [[Pankaj Tripathi]] as Rudra, a paranologist<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/shraddha-kapoor-bonds-with-pankaj-tripathi-on-the-sets-of-stree/articleshow/64866428.cms |title=Shraddha Kapoor bonds with Pankaj Tripathi on the sets of 'Stree' |newspaper=[[The Times of India]]}}</ref>\n* [[Aparshakti Khurana]] as Bittu, Vicky's friend<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/aparshakti-khurana-excited-about-three-films-releasing-back-to-back/articleshow/64924520.cms |title=Aparshakti Khurana excited about three films releasing back-to-back |newspaper=[[The Times of India]]}}</ref>\n* [[Abhishek Banerjee (actor)|Abhishek Banerjee]] as Jaana, Vicky's friend<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP8iwD0yrr0 |title=Stree - Teaser |publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n* [[Flora Saini]] as Stree<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment/telly-talk/gossip/article/all-the-questions-from-the-seventh-episode-of-amitabh-bachchans-kaun-banega-crorepati-season-10/283448|title=NOT Shraddha Kapoor, but THIS actress essayed the role of Stree in Rajkummar Rao-starrer|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n* [[Vijay Raaz]] as Shastri<ref>{{cite news|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/photos/entertainment/bollywood-updates-top-news-about-celebrities-movies-and-controversies/rajkummar-rao-unveils-first-look-of-stree/photostory/64492789.cms |title=Rajkummar Rao unevils first look of Stree |newspaper=[[Mumbai Mirror]]}}</ref>\n* Aakash Dabhade as Narendra\n* Atul Srivastava as Vicky's father\n*Ramkrishna Dhakad as the tailor's assistant\n* [[Nora Fatehi]] (special appearance in song \"Kamariya\")<ref>{{cite news|url=https://m.mid-day.com/articles/after-stree-nora-fatehi-to-sizzle-in-rajkummar-rao-shraddha-kapoors-stree/19681178|title=After Dilbar, Nora Fatehi to sizzle in Rajkummar Rao, Shraddha Kapoor's Stree|newspaper=[[Mid Day]]}}</ref>\n* [[Kriti Sanon]] (special appearance in the song \"Aao Kabhi Haveli Pe\")<ref>{{cite news|last=Rakshit|first=Nayandeep|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/bollywood/report-kriti-sanon-shoots-her-first-item-number-for-stree-2648195|title=Kriti Sanon shoots her first item number for 'Stree'|work=Daily News and Analysis|date=11 August 2018|access-date=12 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\n\nOn 28 November 2017, it was reported that [[Dinesh Vijan]] had finalized [[Rajkummar Rao]] to be the lead actor for his next film, which would be a [[Comedy horror|horror comedy]] written by [[Raj Nidimoru and Krishna D.K.]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/bollywood/revealed-rajkummar-rao-play-leading-man-dinesh-vijans-horror-comedy-film/ |title=Rajkummar Rao to play leading man in Dinesh Vijan's horror comedy film |work=[[Bollywood Hungama]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/rajkummar-rao-to-star-in-dinesh-vijans-horror-comedy/articleshow/61827853.cms |title=Rajkummar Rao to star in Dinesh Vijan's horror-comedy |newspaper=[[Mumbai Mirror]]}}</ref> On 5 December 2017, [[Shraddha Kapoor]] informed through her Twitter handle that she would be working with Rajkummar Rao and Maddock Films in their next film.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/shraddha-kapoor-to-feature-with-rajkummar-rao-in-dinesh-vijans-horror-comedy/articleshow/61939794.cms |title=Shraddha Kapoor to feature with Rajkummar Rao in Dinesh Vijan's horror-comedy |newspaper=[[Mumbai Mirror]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/bollywood/report-shraddha-kapoor-joins-rajkummar-rao-in-dinesh-vijan-and-raj-dk-s-next-2565289 |title=Shraddha Kapoor joins Rajkummar Rao in Dinesh Vijan and Raj-DK's next!

It won [[Filmfare Award for Best Debut Director|Best Debut Director]] for Kaushik.\n\n==Plot==\nThe plot is based on the Indian folk legend about a female spirit/witch who abducts men at night when they are alone and only leaves their clothes behind. The residents of a town named [[Chanderi]] believe in the spirit of an angry woman, referred to as \"[[wikt:\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0940|Stree]]\", who stalks men and whisks them away during the four days of a religious festival every year, causing many disappearances. To protect the residents, \"O Stree, come tomorrow\" is written in Hindi with bat's blood on the entrances of all homes and men are advised to not roam alone after 10 pm during the festive season, and move in groups for safety - a parallel of instructions women are usually told to follow for their own safety.\n\nVicky ([[Rajkummar Rao]]), a ladies' tailor in [[Chanderi]], mysteriously encounters an outlandish and charming woman ([[Shraddha Kapoor]]) who only comes to the town during the annual Durga pooja season and falls in love with her at first sight. She asks him to stitch her a [[lahenga]]. Her frequent disappearances, her shopping list including peculiar items such as a lizard's tail, white cat's furr, flowers of [[Datura]], meat, brandy and suchlike presumed to be ingredients for black magic and the fact that she is not seen by anybody except Vicky, makes his friend Bittu ([[Aparshakti Khurana]]) suspicious, and he starts believing that she could be Stree. After one of his friends, Janna (Abhishek Banerjee), is kidnapped by Stree, Vicky grows suspicious of the woman as well. He confronts her on which she disappears yet again. \n\nThey decide to research the history of the town and the myth of Stree, to find a way to save their friend and ask the town's librarian Rudra Bhaiya ([[Pankaj Tripathi]]) for help, who is also a [[Paranormal|paranologist]]. They come across a partially torn book in his library which mentions Stree's story and an old fort. Vicky, Bittu and Rudra visit the old fort, which Stree is supposedly inhabiting, to find Janna. Stree drives away Bittu and Rudra and is about to attack Vicky but does not, as she senses the feeling of love and respect in his eyes. She is then driven away by the mysterious woman. The woman tells Vicky and his friends that she has been trying to defeat 'Stree' for the last three years after losing someone close to her, this been the reason of her coming during the festival season when Stree haunts the town. This clarifies that The Woman & Stree are two different persons. Where the Woman is a witch who wants to defeat Stree. Stree releases Janna as requested by Vicky, but he starts having sporadic violent episodes. More men go missing after a possessed Janna, under Stree's control, erases the word \"Tomorrow\" from the protective phrases outside everyone's homes, leaving it as \"O Stree, come\"; an invitation.\n\nVicky, Bittu, Rudra and the woman meet the book's author Shankar Shastri ([[Vijay Raaz]]) to find a permanent solution to save the town, who informs them that Stree had once been an extremely beautiful courtesan that every man in town desired. At last she found a man who truly loved her and wanted to marry her, but on their wedding night, Stree and her husband were killed by the town's jealous men. Her spirit has ever since been searching for her true love and also seeks revenge on the town by aiming to abduct every last man in it. Shastri tells them of a prophecy pointing to a saviour and Vicky surprisingly appears to have all the characteristics describing the saviour which is also inclusive of the fact that his mother too was a courtesan who fell in love with his father and married, a story similar to Stree's, but with a fortunate end. Vicky struggles with taking on the truth, confronts his father but then feels grateful for his father's affection and efforts, and decides to save his town which accepted him and didn't denounce him. The friends and the woman make a trap to kill Stree but Vicky realizes that Stree only desires love and respect. Instead of killing her, the mysterious woman suggests Vicky simply cut her long braid - the source of her powers - so that she will be rendered powerless. He does so, and Stree vanishes. The mysterious woman leaves the city the next day and Vicky bids her farewell, forgetting to ask her name all this time. On the bus, the woman merges Stree's braid with her own hair and then vanishes from the bus, implying that she is a witch who has been after Stree\u2019s powers from the braid.\n\nStree visits Chanderi again the following year and finds her own statue at the town entrance with a new phrase - \"O Stree, protect us\" - thus giving her respect, and she does not enter Chanderi.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Shraddha Kapoor]] as the unknown/mysterious woman.\n* [[Rajkummar Rao]] as Vicky, a ladies tailor\n* [[Pankaj Tripathi]] as Rudra, a paranologist<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/shraddha-kapoor-bonds-with-pankaj-tripathi-on-the-sets-of-stree/articleshow/64866428.cms |title=Shraddha Kapoor bonds with Pankaj Tripathi on the sets of 'Stree' |newspaper=[[The Times of India]]}}</ref>\n* [[Aparshakti Khurana]] as Bittu, Vicky's friend<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/aparshakti-khurana-excited-about-three-films-releasing-back-to-back/articleshow/64924520.cms |title=Aparshakti Khurana excited about three films releasing back-to-back |newspaper=[[The Times of India]]}}</ref>\n* [[Abhishek Banerjee (actor)|Abhishek Banerjee]] as Jaana, Vicky's friend<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP8iwD0yrr0 |title=Stree - Teaser |publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n* [[Flora Saini]] as Stree<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment/telly-talk/gossip/article/all-the-questions-from-the-seventh-episode-of-amitabh-bachchans-kaun-banega-crorepati-season-10/283448|title=NOT Shraddha Kapoor, but THIS actress essayed the role of Stree in Rajkummar Rao-starrer|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n* [[Vijay Raaz]] as Shastri<ref>{{cite news|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/photos/entertainment/bollywood-updates-top-news-about-celebrities-movies-and-controversies/rajkummar-rao-unveils-first-look-of-stree/photostory/64492789.cms |title=Rajkummar Rao unevils first look of Stree |newspaper=[[Mumbai Mirror]]}}</ref>\n* Aakash Dabhade as Narendra\n* Atul Srivastava as Vicky's father\n*Ramkrishna Dhakad as the tailor's assistant\n* [[Nora Fatehi]] (special appearance in song \"Kamariya\")<ref>{{cite news|url=https://m.mid-day.com/articles/after-stree-nora-fatehi-to-sizzle-in-rajkummar-rao-shraddha-kapoors-stree/19681178|title=After Dilbar, Nora Fatehi to sizzle in Rajkummar Rao, Shraddha Kapoor's Stree|newspaper=[[Mid Day]]}}</ref>\n* [[Kriti Sanon]] (special appearance in the song \"Aao Kabhi Haveli Pe\")<ref>{{cite news|last=Rakshit|first=Nayandeep|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/bollywood/report-kriti-sanon-shoots-her-first-item-number-for-stree-2648195|title=Kriti Sanon shoots her first item number for 'Stree'|work=Daily News and Analysis|date=11 August 2018|access-date=12 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\n\nOn 28 November 2017, it was reported that [[Dinesh Vijan]] had finalized [[Rajkummar Rao]] to be the lead actor for his next film, which would be a [[Comedy horror|horror comedy]] written by [[Raj Nidimoru and Krishna D.K.]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/bollywood/revealed-rajkummar-rao-play-leading-man-dinesh-vijans-horror-comedy-film/ |title=Rajkummar Rao to play leading man in Dinesh Vijan's horror comedy film |work=[[Bollywood Hungama]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/rajkummar-rao-to-star-in-dinesh-vijans-horror-comedy/articleshow/61827853.cms |title=Rajkummar Rao to star in Dinesh Vijan's horror-comedy |newspaper=[[Mumbai Mirror]]}}</ref> On 5 December 2017, [[Shraddha Kapoor]] informed through her Twitter handle that she would be working with Rajkummar Rao and Maddock Films in their next film.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/shraddha-kapoor-to-feature-with-rajkummar-rao-in-dinesh-vijans-horror-comedy/articleshow/61939794.cms |title=Shraddha Kapoor to feature with Rajkummar Rao in Dinesh Vijan's horror-comedy |newspaper=[[Mumbai Mirror]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/bollywood/report-shraddha-kapoor-joins-rajkummar-rao-in-dinesh-vijan-and-raj-dk-s-next-2565289 |title=Shraddha Kapoor joins Rajkummar Rao in Dinesh Vijan and Raj-DK's next!

The Fellowship eventually splits up and Frodo continues the quest with his loyal companion [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] and the treacherous [[Gollum]].

Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]] and [[John Boorman]]. These attempts resulted in a couple of unproduced scripts, concept art and an animated short. Other filmmakers and producers to have had an interest in adapting Tolkien are said to include [[Walt Disney]], [[Al Brodax]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who considered [[Richard Lester]] to direct, but instead approached [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]) and [[George Lucas]]. The rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]]. In 1976, UA passed the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'' (and a part of the rights to ''The Hobbit'') to [[Fantasy Films|Fantasy films]].\n\nIn 1977, an animated adaptation of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'' was produced as a TV special by [[Rankin/Bass Productions|Rankin and Bass]] (followed in 1980 by a TV animated adaptation of ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]''), and in 1978 [[Ralph Bakshi]] made an animated feature of the first half of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''. While profitable, the film didn't make enough money to automatically warrant the sequel which would close the story, and an argument with producer [[Saul Zaentz]] led Bakshi to abandon the project. Several Tolkien-esque fantasy films were produced at the time, as well, including Boorman's ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' and George Lucas' production of ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]''.\n\nAt the time that Bakshi's film aired, a teenager Peter Jackson hadn't read the book, but \"heard the name\",<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009173240/http://www.conlanpress.com/resources/peter_jackson_on_Tolkien_inspiration_2-6-04.mp3 |title=Peter Jackson, as quoted at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood, on February 6, 2004. |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref> and went to see the film: \"I liked the early part \u2013 it had some quaint sequences in Hobbiton, a creepy encounter with the Black Rider on the road, and a few quite good battle scenes \u2013 but then, about half way through, the storytelling became very disjointed and disorientating and I really didn't understand what was going on.

October\u2013November 2001.</ref>\n\n=== Pitch to Miramax ===\nIn 1995, while completing post-production on ''[[The Frighteners]]'', Jackson and Fran Walsh discussed making an original fantasy film, but couldn't think of a scenario that wasn't Tolkien-esque, and eventually decided to look up the film rights. They went to [[Harvey Weinstein]] from [[Miramax]], who got the rights from Saul Zaentz. Jackson knew it would take multiple films to do Tolkien justice,<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=|title=A Filmmaker's Journey|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=36-40}}</ref> but initially pitched a single trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' and, if that would prove successful, two ''Lord of the Rings'' films shot back-to-back.<ref name=\":5\" /> Jackson began rereading The Hobbit, looking at illustrations and commissioning concept art from the book, but the rights eventually proved unattainable, having been split between Zaentz and United Artists. Harvey tried to the buy the studio's share of the rights, but was unsuccessful.\n\nWith the Hobbit postponed for a later prequel, Jackson proceeded with making two or more<ref name=\":6\" /> ''Lord of the Rings'' films: \"We pitched the idea of three films and Miramax didn't really want to take that risk, but we agreed on two.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggVDYcvNxg |title=Peter Jackson interview with Charlie Rose, 2002 |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228201928/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggVDYcvNxg|archive-date=28 February 2020|access-date=}}</ref> He began writing the scripts with Walsh and [[Stephen Sinclair]], storyboard with [[Christian Rivers]] and discussing casting ideas with the Weinsteins. Meanwhile [[Weta Digital|WETA Digital]] began software development for the digital effects required,<ref name=\":0\" /> and  [[Weta Workshop|WETA Workshop]] were producing props and concept art. Sinclair later dropped from the project, but Jackson felt that some of his contributions survived into the finished scripts, particularly the middle film, ''The Two Towers'', for which he is credited.\n\n=== Move to New Line ===\nHowever, as the scripts took shape, it became clear that the budget required would exceed Miramax' capabilities. The Weinsteins suggested cutting the project to one film.<ref name=\":0\" /> Jackson inquired whether it could be around four-hours in duration, but Miramax insisted on two hours, suggesting major cuts to the story, which Jackson refused. Harvey Weinstein threatened to replace Jackson with screenwriter [[Hossein Amini]] and directors [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]]. Jackson believes this was an empty threat to get him to concede to making a one-film version himself. <ref name=\":7\" />\n\nHarvey eventually relented to putting the project on a turnaround, but the onerous conditions were meant to prevent the project from being taken up by another studio.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book |last= |first= |title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=39\u201340}}</ref> Jackson got an audience with New Line CEO [[Robert Shaye]], who accepted the project, but requested that it be expanded into a trilogy. Final Cut rights were shared contractually between Jackson and Bob Shaye, but there was never any interference in Jackson's cut.\n\n== Production ==\n{{Main|Production of The Lord of the Rings film series}}\n[[File:Alan Lee 2005.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]], a Tolkien illustrator who assisted in the visual design, at [[63rd World Science Fiction Convention|Worldcon 2005]] in [[Glasgow]].]]\nJackson began [[storyboard]]ing and [[screenwriting]] the series with [[Christian Rivers]], [[Fran Walsh]] and [[Philippa Boyens]] in 1997 and assigned his crew to begin designing Middle-earth at the same time.<ref name=\"TTT Art\">{{Cite book |last=Russell |first=Gary |authorlink=Gary Russell |title=The Art of the Two Towers |publisher=Harper Collins |year=2003 |isbn=0-00-713564-5}}</ref> Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens did not write each film to correspond exactly to its respective book, opting instead to write a three-part [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] with some sequences missing, some sequences created from scratch, and some sequences moved from one area to another regardless of its placement in the books.

The films, which were released between 2012 and 2014, used much of the cast of ''The Lord of the Rings'', including [[Ian McKellen]], [[Andy Serkis]], [[Hugo Weaving]], [[Elijah Wood]], [[Ian Holm]], [[Christopher Lee]], [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Orlando Bloom]] who reprised their roles. Most of the crew returned, as well, with Jackson directing, him and Walsh producing and Boyens co-writing. Ngila Dickson, Grant Major, Jim Rygiel and Ethan Van der Ryn dropped out from costume design, production design, animation and sound editing respectivelly, but were succeeded by their Lord of the Rings colleagues, Richard Taylor, Dan Hennah, Joe Letteri and Brent Burge. The only complete changes in the staff involved the change of gaffer, after [[Brian Bansgrove]] died between the trilogies, and stunt coordinator Glen Boswall replaced [[George Marshall Ruge]] who worked on ''Rings''. \n\nAlthough the ''Hobbit'' trilogy was commercially successful, it received mixed reviews from critics. However, the films did manage to add another seven Academy Award nominations to the series' tally, to an overall 37, and another win for the [[Scientific and Engineering Award]], resulting in the most nominations and wins for a six-part series.\n\n=== Amazon's ''The Lord of the Rings'' prequel series ===\n[[Amazon Studios]] discussed development of a series based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' with [[Warner Bros.

Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]] and [[John Boorman]]. These attempts resulted in a couple of unproduced scripts, concept art and an animated short. Other filmmakers and producers to have had an interest in adapting Tolkien are said to include [[Walt Disney]], [[Al Brodax]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who considered [[Richard Lester]] to direct, but instead approached [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]) and [[George Lucas]]. The rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]]. In 1976, UA passed the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'' (and a part of the rights to ''The Hobbit'') to [[Fantasy Films|Fantasy films]].\n\nIn 1977, an animated adaptation of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'' was produced as a TV special by [[Rankin/Bass Productions|Rankin and Bass]] (followed in 1980 by a TV animated adaptation of ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]''), and in 1978 [[Ralph Bakshi]] made an animated feature of the first half of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''. While profitable, the film didn't make enough money to automatically warrant the sequel which would close the story, and an argument with producer [[Saul Zaentz]] led Bakshi to abandon the project. Several Tolkien-esque fantasy films were produced at the time, as well, including Boorman's ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' and George Lucas' production of ''[[Willow (film)|Willow]]''.\n\nAt the time that Bakshi's film aired, a teenager Peter Jackson hadn't read the book, but \"heard the name\",<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009173240/http://www.conlanpress.com/resources/peter_jackson_on_Tolkien_inspiration_2-6-04.mp3 |title=Peter Jackson, as quoted at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood, on February 6, 2004. |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref> and went to see the film: \"I liked the early part \u2013 it had some quaint sequences in Hobbiton, a creepy encounter with the Black Rider on the road, and a few quite good battle scenes \u2013 but then, about half way through, the storytelling became very disjointed and disorientating and I really didn't understand what was going on. However, what it did do was to make me want to read the book \u2013 if only to find out what happened!\"<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sibley |first=Brian |title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey |publisher= |year= |isbn= |location= |pages=6}}</ref> Jackson bought a tie-in paperback edition. He later read ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Silmarillion'', and listened to the 1981 BBC radio adaptation. Assuming someone will one day adapt it to a live-action film, Jackson read on some previous attempts to bring the piece to the screen.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XDsSr3sGSI&t=2369s |title=Peter Jackson Exeter interview, 2015 |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Pitch to Miramax ===\nIn 1995, while completing post-production on ''[[The Frighteners]]'', Jackson and Fran Walsh discussed making an original fantasy film, but couldn't think of a scenario that wasn't Tolkien-esque, and eventually decided to look up the film rights. They went to [[Harvey Weinstein]] from [[Miramax]], who got the rights from Saul Zaentz. Jackson knew it would take multiple films to do Tolkien justice,<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=|title=A Filmmaker's Journey|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=36-40}}</ref> but initially pitched a single trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' and, if that would prove successful, two ''Lord of the Rings'' films shot back-to-back.<ref name=\":5\" /> Jackson began rereading The Hobbit, looking at illustrations and commissioning concept art from the book, but the rights eventually proved unattainable, having been split between Zaentz and United Artists. Harvey tried to the buy the studio's share of the rights, but was unsuccessful.\n\nWith the Hobbit postponed for a later prequel, Jackson proceeded with making two or more<ref name=\":6\" /> ''Lord of the Rings'' films: \"We pitched the idea of three films and Miramax didn't really want to take that risk, but we agreed on two.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggVDYcvNxg |title=Peter Jackson interview with Charlie Rose, 2002 |last= |first= |date= |website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228201928/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ggVDYcvNxg|archive-date=28 February 2020|access-date=}}</ref> He began writing the scripts with Walsh and [[Stephen Sinclair]], storyboard with [[Christian Rivers]] and discussing casting ideas with the Weinsteins. Meanwhile [[Weta Digital|WETA Digital]] began software development for the digital effects required,<ref name=\":0\" /> and  [[Weta Workshop|WETA Workshop]] were producing props and concept art. Sinclair later dropped from the project, but Jackson felt that some of his contributions survived into the finished scripts, particularly the middle film, ''The Two Towers'', for which he is credited.\n\n=== Move to New Line ===\nHowever, as the scripts took shape, it became clear that the budget required would exceed Miramax' capabilities. The Weinsteins suggested cutting the project to one film.<ref name=\":0\" /> Jackson inquired whether it could be around four-hours in duration, but Miramax insisted on two hours, suggesting major cuts to the story, which Jackson refused.

The films, which were released between 2012 and 2014, used much of the cast of ''The Lord of the Rings'', including [[Ian McKellen]], [[Andy Serkis]], [[Hugo Weaving]], [[Elijah Wood]], [[Ian Holm]], [[Christopher Lee]], [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Orlando Bloom]] who reprised their roles. Most of the crew returned, as well, with Jackson directing, him and Walsh producing and Boyens co-writing. Ngila Dickson, Grant Major, Jim Rygiel and Ethan Van der Ryn dropped out from costume design, production design, animation and sound editing respectivelly, but were succeeded by their Lord of the Rings colleagues, Richard Taylor, Dan Hennah, Joe Letteri and Brent Burge. The only complete changes in the staff involved the change of gaffer, after [[Brian Bansgrove]] died between the trilogies, and stunt coordinator Glen Boswall replaced [[George Marshall Ruge]] who worked on ''Rings''. \n\nAlthough the ''Hobbit'' trilogy was commercially successful, it received mixed reviews from critics. However, the films did manage to add another seven Academy Award nominations to the series' tally, to an overall 37, and another win for the [[Scientific and Engineering Award]], resulting in the most nominations and wins for a six-part series.\n\n=== Amazon's ''The Lord of the Rings'' prequel series ===\n[[Amazon Studios]] discussed development of a series based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' with [[Warner Bros.

{"title_page": "Group of death", "text_new": "{{short description|Unusually competitive group in a multi-stage sports tournament}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\nA '''group of death''' in a [[multi-stage tournament]] is a [[group tournament|group]] which is unusually competitive, because the number of strong competitors in the group is greater than the number of qualifying places available for the next phase of the tournament. Thus, in the group phase, one or more strong competitors in the \"group of death\" will necessarily be eliminated, who would otherwise have been expected to progress further in the tournament. The informal term was first used for groups in the [[FIFA World Cup]] finals. It is now also used in other [[association football]] tournaments and other sports.\n\nAfter the draw for a tournament has been made, debates often arise about which of the preliminary groups is \"the\" group of death.  This happens for multiple reasons: in part, from more general debates about the relative strengths of the various competitors; but, additionally, because there is no exact definition of the term \"group of death\".  Sometimes, the term simply signifies a group with only the strongest competitors, all of which are potential winners of the tournament, implying there is always precisely one such group; other definitions allow for multiple groups of death or for none at all.\n\nThe term is sometimes derided as a purely journalistic invention, a [[clich\u00e9]]<ref name=\"Limey\">{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/soccer/01/27/the.limey/index.html |title=Groups of death, Chop Suey and other soccer clich\u00e9s |last=Pickstone |first=Jon |author2=Ben Franklin |date=27 January 2006|work=The Limey  |publisher=SI.com|accessdate=4 December 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"ian-paul\">{{cite news |page=10 |title=Dutch can live in the Milan 'Group of Death' |first=Ian |last=Paul |work=The Herald |date=23 November 1992 |location=Glasgow |quote=If that notorious nickname of 1986, \"The Group of Death,\" which was used to describe Scotland's section in the World Cup finals in Mexico, was the child of an over-enthusiastic hack, three of the teams in Group B of the Champions' League would consider it a mild moniker for their section. }}</ref><ref name=\"Lovejoy\"/> or oversimplification based entirely on the unsportsmanlike notion that outcomes of such tournaments are largely predictable and that there are always [[Underdog (term)|underdog]]s, [[dark horse]]s and [[wikt:top dog|top dog]]s.<ref name=\"surprises\"/><ref name=\"Hawkey\">{{cite news |url=https://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2093-2209740,00.html |title=African dream lives in Ivory tower |last=Hawkey |first=Ian |date=4 June 2006 |work=The Sunday Times |accessdate=4 December 2009 |quote=The Group of Death has always been an ugly misnomer, although as every big tournament now seems obliged to identify its corpses early, the World Cup has to have one. }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Origin==\nThe term \"group of death\" was coined (as [[Spanish language|Spanish]] \"''grupo de la muerte''\") by Mexican journalists for [[1970 FIFA World Cup#Group 3|Group 3 of the 1970 FIFA World Cup]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The beautiful team: in search of Pel\u00e9 and the 1970 Brazilians |first=Garry |last=Jenkins |author2=Pedro Redig |author3=Antonio Pires Soares  |year=1998 |isbn=0-684-81955-4 |page=22 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |quote=[[Jo\u00e3o Saldanha|Saldanha]] had no argument with the journalists who quickly christened the Group of Death.}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Motson |first=John |author2=Nick Brownlee |title=Motson's World Cup Extravaganza |publisher=Robson |year=2006 |page=171 |isbn=1-86105-936-1 |quote=Group of Death - The term 'Group of Death' was first coined by the Mexican press in 1970 to describe Group 3}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://mundial.emol.com/historia/1970.asp |title=M\u00e9xico 1970 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=[[El Mercurio]] Online |language=Spanish |year=2002 |accessdate=3 December 2009 |quote=Se puede decir que el primer \"Grupo de la Muerte\" en la historia lo fue el 3 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013080358/http://mundial.emol.com/historia/1970.asp |archivedate=13 October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|year=1970 |title=Futbol |journal=Hispano Americano;

For example, the draw for the pools of the [[Rugby World Cup]] (union) primarily uses teams' positions in the [[World Rugby Rankings]] to determine placement in the \"pots\" for the draw. However, the draw has traditionally been held nearly three years before the competition. For example, the pool draw for the [[2015 Rugby World Cup]] was held in December 2012. This led to the host team, [[England national rugby union team|England]], being drawn into a pool that included traditional powers [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] and [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]], with only two teams able to advance to the knockout stage. Because Wales had gone winless in their [[2012 end-of-year rugby union internationals|November 2012 Tests]], they had dropped to ninth in the rankings at the time of the draw. Australia were third and England fifth at the time, placing all three teams into separate pots.

Thus, in the group phase, one or more strong competitors in the \"group of death\" will necessarily be eliminated, who would otherwise have been expected to progress further in the tournament. The informal term was first used for groups in the [[FIFA World Cup]] finals. It is now also used in other [[association football]] tournaments and other sports.\n\nAfter the draw for a tournament has been made, debates often arise about which of the preliminary groups is \"the\" group of death.  This happens for multiple reasons: in part, from more general debates about the relative strengths of the various competitors; but, additionally, because there is no exact definition of the term \"group of death\".  Sometimes, the term simply signifies a group with only the strongest competitors, all of which are potential winners of the tournament, implying there is always precisely one such group; other definitions allow for multiple groups of death or for none at all.\n\nThe term is sometimes derided as a purely journalistic invention, a [[clich\u00e9]]<ref name=\"Limey\">{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/soccer/01/27/the.limey/index.html |title=Groups of death, Chop Suey and other soccer clich\u00e9s |last=Pickstone |first=Jon |author2=Ben Franklin |date=27 January 2006|work=The Limey  |publisher=SI.com|accessdate=4 December 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"ian-paul\">{{cite news |page=10 |title=Dutch can live in the Milan 'Group of Death' |first=Ian |last=Paul |work=The Herald |date=23 November 1992 |location=Glasgow |quote=If that notorious nickname of 1986, \"The Group of Death,\" which was used to describe Scotland's section in the World Cup finals in Mexico, was the child of an over-enthusiastic hack, three of the teams in Group B of the Champions' League would consider it a mild moniker for their section. }}</ref><ref name=\"Lovejoy\"/> or oversimplification based entirely on the unsportsmanlike notion that outcomes of such tournaments are largely predictable and that there are always [[Underdog (term)|underdog]]s, [[dark horse]]s and [[wikt:top dog|top dog]]s.<ref name=\"surprises\"/><ref name=\"Hawkey\">{{cite news |url=https://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2093-2209740,00.html |title=African dream lives in Ivory tower |last=Hawkey |first=Ian |date=4 June 2006 |work=The Sunday Times |accessdate=4 December 2009 |quote=The Group of Death has always been an ugly misnomer, although as every big tournament now seems obliged to identify its corpses early, the World Cup has to have one. }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Origin==\nThe term \"group of death\" was coined (as [[Spanish language|Spanish]] \"''grupo de la muerte''\") by Mexican journalists for [[1970 FIFA World Cup#Group 3|Group 3 of the 1970 FIFA World Cup]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The beautiful team: in search of Pel\u00e9 and the 1970 Brazilians |first=Garry |last=Jenkins |author2=Pedro Redig |author3=Antonio Pires Soares  |year=1998 |isbn=0-684-81955-4 |page=22 |publisher=Simon & Schuster |quote=[[Jo\u00e3o Saldanha|Saldanha]] had no argument with the journalists who quickly christened the Group of Death.}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Motson |first=John |author2=Nick Brownlee |title=Motson's World Cup Extravaganza |publisher=Robson |year=2006 |page=171 |isbn=1-86105-936-1 |quote=Group of Death - The term 'Group of Death' was first coined by the Mexican press in 1970 to describe Group 3}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://mundial.emol.com/historia/1970.asp |title=M\u00e9xico 1970 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=[[El Mercurio]] Online |language=Spanish |year=2002 |accessdate=3 December 2009 |quote=Se puede decir que el primer \"Grupo de la Muerte\" en la historia lo fue el 3 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013080358/http://mundial.emol.com/historia/1970.asp |archivedate=13 October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|year=1970 |title=Futbol |journal=Hispano Americano;

For example, the draw for the pools of the [[Rugby World Cup]] (union) primarily uses teams' positions in the [[World Rugby Rankings]] to determine placement in the \"pots\" for the draw. However, the draw has traditionally been held nearly three years before the competition. For example, the pool draw for the [[2015 Rugby World Cup]] was held in December 2012. This led to the host team, [[England national rugby union team|England]], being drawn into a pool that included traditional powers [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] and [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]], with only two teams able to advance to the knockout stage. Because Wales had gone winless in their [[2012 end-of-year rugby union internationals|November 2012 Tests]], they had dropped to ninth in the rankings at the time of the draw. Australia were third and England fifth at the time, placing all three teams into separate pots.

For instance, most sources but not all include [[Anabaptism]], [[Anglicanism]] and [[Baptist]]s as part of Protestantism.<ref name=\"Shurden1995\">{{cite book |last1=Shurden |first1=Walter B. |title=Not a Silent People: Controversies that Have Shaped Southern Baptists |date=1995 |publisher=Smyth & Helwys Publishing, Inc. |isbn=978-1-57312-021-0 |page=48 |language=en}}</ref> Moreover, most Protestant denominations do not form a single structure comparable to those of the Catholic Church, and to a lesser extent Oriental Orthodoxy and Eastern Orthodoxy, though comparable communions exist, such as the [[World Baptist Alliance]], the [[World Methodist Council]] and the [[World Lutheran Federation]]. Nevertheless, 1,000 million is the most accepted figure among various authors and scholars, and thus is used in this article. Note that 1,000 million figure also includes Anglicanism, as well as [[Anabaptism|Anabaptists]], [[Baptists]] and multiple other groups which have in their scope some denominations that might disavow a common \"Protestant\" designation, and would rather prefer to be called, simply, \"Christian\".\n\n====Historical Protestantism \u2013 300\u2013400 million====\nThe number of individuals who are members of historical Protestant Churches totals to 300-400 million.<ref name=\"GlobalChristianity\"/>\n=====[[Baptists|Baptist churches]] \u2013 75\u2013105 million=====\nThe number of individuals who hold membership in the Baptist denomination totals to 75-105 million, being represented in the following Churches:<ref name=\"GlobalChristianity\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.christianemergencynetwork.org/emergency-directory/business/alliances/baptist-world-alliance|title=Baptist World Alliance|date=14 August 2014|website=community.christianemergencynetwork.org|access-date=15 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819083138/http://community.christianemergencynetwork.org/emergency-directory/business/alliances/baptist-world-alliance|archive-date=19 August 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n*[[Southern Baptist Convention]] \u2013 14.8 million<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bpnews.net/52962/acp--giving-increases-baptisms-attendance-continue-decline|title=SBC: Giving increases while baptisms continue decline|publisher=Baptist Press|accessdate=25 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190525014132/http://www.bpnews.net/52962/acp--giving-increases-baptisms-attendance-continue-decline|archive-date=25 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.]] \u2013 7.5 million<ref>[http://www.nationalbaptist.com/about-us/index.html About Us] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907213555/http://www.nationalbaptist.com/about-us/index.html |date=7 September 2017 }} The National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.</ref>\n* [[Nigerian Baptist Convention]] \u2013 5.0 million<ref name=\"BWA\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bwanet.org/about-us2/stats|title=Baptist World Alliance - Statistics|website=www.bwanet.org|access-date=28 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160618021030/http://www.bwanet.org/about-us2/stats|archive-date=18 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[National Missionary Baptist Convention of America]] \u2013 3.1 million<ref name=\"BWA\"/>\n* [[National Baptist Convention of America, Inc.]] \u2013 3.1 million<ref name=\"BWA\"/>\n* [[Baptist Union of Uganda]] \u2013 2.5 million<ref name=\"BWA\"/>\n* [[Baptist Community of Congo]] \u2013 2.1 million<ref name=\"BWA\"/>\n* [[Baptist Convention of Tanzania]] \u2013 2.0 million<ref name=\"BWA\"/>\n* [[Baptist General Convention of Texas]] \u2013 2.0 million<ref name=\"BWA\"/>\n* [[Brazilian Baptist Convention]] \u2013 1.6 million<ref name=\"BWA\"/>\n* [[Progressive National Baptist Convention]] \u2013 1.5 million<ref name=\"BWA\"/>\n* [[Council of Baptist Churches in Northeast India]] \u2013 1.3 million<ref name=\"BWA\"/>\n* [[American Baptist Churches USA]] \u2013 1.2 million<ref name=\"BWA\"/>\n* [[Baptist Bible Fellowship International]] \u2013 1.2 million<ref name=\"Rhodes\">Ron Rhodes, ''The Complete Guide to Christian Denominations'', Harvest House, 2007</ref>\n* [[Lott Carey Foreign Mission Convention]] \u2013 1.1 million<ref name=\"BWA\"/>\n* [[Baptist Community of the Congo River]] \u2013 1.1 million<ref name=\"BWA\"/>\n* [[National Primitive Baptist Convention of the U.S.A.]] \u2013 1.0 million<ref name=\"Rhodes\"/>\n* [[Myanmar Baptist Convention]] \u2013 1.0 million<ref name=\"BWA\"/>\n* [[Cooperative Baptist Fellowship]] \u2013 0.8 million<ref name=\"BWA\"/>\n* [[Baptist General Association of Virginia]] \u2013 0.6 million<ref name=\"BWA\"/>\n* [[Baptist Convention of Kenya]] \u2013 0.6 million<ref name=\"BWA\"/>\n* [[Nagaland Baptist Church Council]] \u2013 0.6 million<ref name=\"BWA\"/>\n* [[Korea Baptist Convention]] \u2013 0.5 million<ref name=\"BWA\"/>\n* [[Samavesam of Telugu Baptist Churches]] \u2013 0.5 million<ref name=\"BWA\"/>\n* Orissa Evangelical Baptist Crusade \u2013 0.5 million<ref name=\"BWA\"/>\n* [[National Baptist Convention, Brazil|National Baptist Convention (Brazil)]] \u2013 0.4 million<ref name=\"BWA\"/>\n* [[Baptist Convention of Malawi]] \u2013 0.3 million<ref name=\"BWA\"/>\n* [[Garo Baptist Convention]] \u2013 0.3 million<ref name=\"BWA\"/>\n* [[Convention of Philippine Baptist Churches]] \u2013 0.3<ref name=\"BWA\"/>\n* [[Ghana Baptist Convention]] \u2013 0.3<ref name=\"BWA\"/>\n* [[Union of Baptist Churches in Rwanda]] \u2013 0.3 million<ref name=\"BWA\"/>\n* [[Conservative Baptist Association of America]] \u2013 0.2 million<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thearda.com/Denoms/D_1382.asp |title=Conservative Baptist Association of America (CBAmerica)&#124;

For instance, most sources but not all include [[Anabaptism]], [[Anglicanism]] and [[Baptist]]s as part of Protestantism.<ref name=\"Shurden1995\">{{cite book |last1=Shurden |first1=Walter B. |title=Not a Silent People: Controversies that Have Shaped Southern Baptists |date=1995 |publisher=Smyth & Helwys Publishing, Inc. |isbn=978-1-57312-021-0 |page=48 |language=en}}</ref> Moreover, most Protestant denominations do not form a single structure comparable to those of the Catholic Church, and to a lesser extent Oriental Orthodoxy and Eastern Orthodoxy, though comparable communions exist, such as the [[World Baptist Alliance]], the [[World Methodist Council]] and the [[World Lutheran Federation]]. Nevertheless, 1,000 million is the most accepted figure among various authors and scholars, and thus is used in this article.

[[Greece]], and the largest station of the country. It is located in the central quarter of [[Kolonos]]. It resulted from the merger of the city's two main railway terminals, the '''Larissa Station''' ({{lang-el|\u03a3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b8\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u039b\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2}}) of the [[Piraeus\u2013Platy railway]] line towards central and northern Greece, and of the '''Peloponnese Station''' ({{lang-el|\u03a3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b8\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u03a0\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5}}, ''Stathm\u00f3s Peloponn\u00edsou'') of the [[Piraeus\u2013Patras railway]] line linking Athens with the southern [[Peloponnese]] peninsula. The station is still colloquially known as \"Larissa Station\", which is also the name of a [[Athens Metro|Metro]] station there.\n\n==History==\nInaugurated on 29 June 1904, the station was named after the city of [[Larissa]], as the southern terminal of the line to the [[Thessaly|Thessalian]] city and [[Thessaloniki]]. The older adjacent station, '''''Stathm\u00f3s Peloponn\u00edsou''''' (\u03a3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b8\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u03a0\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5, {{coord|37|59|22.6|N|23|43|9.52|E}}), was inaugurated on 30 June 1884, named after the [[Peloponnese]] peninsula due to its services to the region. Closed on 7 August 2005, along with the [[Piraeus]]-[[Agioi Anargyroi]] line, its activities since then moved to the ''Stathmos Larissis''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.athensguide.com/schedules/trains.html|title=Athens Guide: Trains in Greece|website=www.athensguide.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref> Regarding the [[Athens Metro|metro station]], part of the [[Line 2 (Athens Metro)|Line 2]], it is an underground stop inaugurated on 28 January 2000. On 4 June 2017 the last service departed the un-modernized section of the Athens railway station, having been closed for modernization that took over the Peloponese railway station.\n\n==Structure==\nLarissa Station has a large, two-floor [[Station building|building]] in front of a square ''Domokou'' avenue, in which there are some platforms for bus services. Currently (Spring 2019) in use are 3 platforms and 4 tracks.\nThe whole station is under reconstruction for modernization and enlargement<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFbVqNX2iFY Drone view of the station and the construction works, July 2017]</ref>: the station will be improved with 12 tracks and 7 platforms and the line electrified.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bueker.net/trainspotting/map.php?file=maps/greece/greece.gif|title=Railway map of Greece, showing also lines under electrification works|publisher=|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref> Construction of the new platforms (9 and 10) and tracks, located where the [[Goods station|goods yard]] of Peloponnese station was, is complete.<ref>[https://www.ypodomes.com/index.php/metafores/treno/item/41489-metamorfothike-o-stathmos-larisis-me-tis-nees-apovathres New platforms in use in the Athens central railway station, Article in construction online magazine ypodomes.com (in Greek), 07/07/2017]</ref>\n\n==Services==\nThe station is served by [[Line 2 (Athens Metro)|Line 2]] of the [[Athens Metro]] and by three ''[[Proastiakos]]'' [[commuter rail|suburban]] services: [[Piraeus station|Piraeus]]\u2013[[Athens Airport Station|Athens Airport]], Piraeus\u2013[[Kiato railway station|Kiato]] and Athens\u2013[[Chalcis railway station|Chalcis]]. It also serves as the terminus for the regional service to [[Leianokladi railway station|Leianokladi]], the express service to [[Kalambaka railway station|Kalambaka]] and the [[InterCity]] service to [[New Thessaloniki Railway Station|Thessaloniki]].\n\nDuring the twentieth century, especially in the first half, Athens station was the terminus for some international trains, such as an [[Express train|Express]] to [[Berlin]] (departing from the former [[Berlin Anhalter Bahnhof|Anhalter Bahnhof]]) or the \"Arlberg\"<ref>[[:commons:File:Orient-Express Historic Routes (en).svg|See map on

[[Greece]], and the largest station of the country. It is located in the central quarter of [[Kolonos]]. It resulted from the merger of the city's two main railway terminals, the '''Larissa Station''' ({{lang-el|\u03a3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b8\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u039b\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2}}) of the [[Piraeus\u2013Platy railway]] line towards central and northern Greece, and of the '''Peloponnese Station''' ({{lang-el|\u03a3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b8\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u03a0\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5}}, ''Stathm\u00f3s Peloponn\u00edsou'') of the [[Piraeus\u2013Patras railway]] line linking Athens with the southern [[Peloponnese]] peninsula. The station is still colloquially known as \"Larissa Station\", which is also the name of a [[Athens Metro|Metro]] station there.\n\n==History==\nInaugurated on 29 June 1904, the station was named after the city of [[Larissa]], as the southern terminal of the line to the [[Thessaly|Thessalian]] city and [[Thessaloniki]]. The older adjacent station, '''''Stathm\u00f3s Peloponn\u00edsou''''' (\u03a3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b8\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u03a0\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5, {{coord|37|59|22.6|N|23|43|9.52|E}}), was inaugurated on 30 June 1884, named after the [[Peloponnese]] peninsula due to its services to the region. Closed on 7 August 2005, along with the [[Piraeus]]-[[Agioi Anargyroi]] line, its activities since then moved to the ''Stathmos Larissis''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.athensguide.com/schedules/trains.html|title=Athens Guide: Trains in Greece|website=www.athensguide.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref> Regarding the [[Athens Metro|metro station]], part of the [[Line 2 (Athens Metro)|Line 2]], it is an underground stop inaugurated on 28 January 2000.

As a [[fighter ace]], he is credited with 45 aerial victories claimed in approximately 700 combat missions, all of which on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]].\n\nBorn in [[Erfurt]], Sch\u00f6pfel grew up in the [[Weimar Republic]] and [[Nazi Germany]] and joined the German police force. In 1936, he transferred to the Luftwaffe and following flight training was posted to a fighter wing. In September 1939, Sch\u00f6pfel became a squadron leader in [[Jagdgeschwader 26|''Jagdgeschwader'' 26]] \"Schlageter\" (JG&nbsp;26\u201426th Fighter Wing). Flying with this wing, Sch\u00f6pfel claimed his first aerial victory on 19 May 1940 during the [[Battle of France]]. In August 1941, he was given command of III. ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933\u201345)#Gruppe|Gruppe]]'' of JG&nbsp;26. During the [[Battle of Britain]], he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] on 11 September for 20 aerial victories claimed. In December 1941, Sch\u00f6pfel was appointed ''[[Geschwaderkommodore]]'' (wing commander) of JG&nbsp;26, a position he held until January 1943.\n\nSch\u00f6pfel then held various staff positions with ''[[Jagdfliegerf\u00fchrer Bretagne]]'', ''[[Jagdfliegerf\u00fchrer Sizilien]]'' and ''[[Jagdfliegerf\u00fchrer Norwegen]]''. In May 1944, he was posted to [[Jagdgeschwader 54|''Jagdgeschwader'' 54]] (JG&nbsp;54\u201454th Fighter Wing) and in June was given command of [[Jagdgeschwader 4|''Jagdgeschwader'' 4]] (JG&nbsp;4\u20144th Fighter Wing). In April 1945, he was appointed commander of [[Jagdgeschwader 6|''Jagdgeschwader'' 6]] (JG&nbsp;6\u20146th Fighter Wing). At the end of the war, he became a Soviet [[prisoner of war]] and was released in December 1949. Sch\u00f6pfel died on 15 May 2003 in [[Bergisch Gladbach]].\n\n==Early life and career==\nSch\u00f6pfel was born on 19 December 1912 at [[Erfurt]], at the time in [[Province of Saxony]] of the [[German Empire]]. Serving with the ''[[Landespolizei]]'' (state police), he transferred to the [[Luftwaffe]] in 1936 and held the rank of ''[[Oberf\u00e4hnrich]]'' (officer cadet).{{sfn|Obermaier|1989|p=200}} Following flight training,{{refn|Flight training in the Luftwaffe progressed through the levels A1, A2 and B1, B2, referred to as A/B flight training. A training included theoretical and practical training in aerobatics, navigation, long-distance flights and dead-stick landings. The B courses included high-altitude flights, instrument flights, night landings and training to handle the aircraft in difficult situations.{{sfn|Bergstr\u00f6m|Antipov|Sundin|2003|p=17}}|group=\"Note\"}} Sch\u00f6pfel was assigned to I.

''Gruppe'' of [[Jagdgeschwader 233|''Jagdgeschwader'' 233]] (JG&nbsp;233\u2014233rd Fighter Wing) and was again renamed on 1 May 1939, this time becoming the I. ''Gruppe'' of [[Jagdgeschwader 51|''Jagdgeschwader'' 51]] (JG&nbsp;51\u201451st Fighter Wing). Initially flying the [[Heinkel He 51]], the unit was reequipped with the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]&nbsp;B in November 1937.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|Rodeike|Bock|2000a|pp=206, 208}} In 1938, Sch\u00f6pfel was transferred to the ''Stab'' (HQ) flight of I.

This ''Gruppe'' also underwent a few name changes. On 1 November 1938, it received the designation I. ''Gruppe'' of [[Jagdgeschwader 132|''Jagdgeschwader'' 132]] (JG&nbsp;132\u2014132nd Fighter Wing) and then again on 1 May 1939 when it was referred to as I.

''Gruppe'', on 23 September 1939.{{sfn|Caldwell|1996|p=10}} He claimed his first aerial victory during the [[Battle of France]] on 19 May 1940. In combat with the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] and [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), 9. ''Staffel'' attacked [[Lille]]-[[Marck, Pas-de-Calais|Marck]]. Sch\u00f6pfel claimed a [[Hawker Hurricane]] fighter shot down northeast of [[Kortrijk|Courtrai]], the claim remained unconfirmed.{{sfn|Caldwell|1996|pp=28\u201329}} The opponent may have been [[Flying Officer]] Dick Pexton, [[No. 615 Squadron RAF|615 Squadron]].

''Gruppe'', replacing ''Major'' Ernst Freiherr von Berg.{{sfn|Caldwell|1996|p=37}} The [[Armistice of 22 June 1940]] ended the Battle of France and III. ''Gruppe'' was ordered to [[M\u00f6nchen-Gladbach]] for a period of maintenance and replenishment.{{sfn|Caldwell|1996|p=41}} On 21 July, III. ''Gruppe'' was moved to an airfield at [[Caffiers]] in northern France, close to the [[English Channel]] in preparation for the [[Battle of Britain]].{{sfn|Caldwell|1996|p=41}} Sch\u00f6pfel claimed his first two aerial victories during the Battle of Britain on 8 August. In a mission to [[Dover]], clearing the airspace ahead of [[Junkers Ju 87]] [[dive bomber]]s from [[Luftflotte 3|''Luftflotte'' 3]] (Air Fleet 3) attacking Allied convoy ''Peewit'' during the ''[[Kanalkampf]]'', Sch\u00f6pfel claimed a [[No. 600 Squadron RAF|No. 600 Squadron]] [[Bristol Blenheim]] bomber and a [[No. 65 Squadron RAF|No. 65 Squadron]] Spitfire destroyed.{{sfn|Caldwell|1996|pp=50\u201351}} The Blenheim crashed into the sea off [[Ramsgate]]. Flying Officer D. N. Grice, [[Sergeant]] F. J. Keast and A.C.J.B.Q Warren all [[killed in action]].{{sfn|Mason|1969|p=218}} Sch\u00f6pfel had originally misidentified the Blenheim and filed the claim over a [[Handley Page Hampden]] bomber.{{sfn|Goss|2018|p=89}} On 12 August, one day before ''[[Adlertag]]'', he claimed a Spitfire shot down near [[Folkestone]]. The Spitfire belonged to either [[No. 151 Squadron RAF|No. 151]] or [[No. 501 Squadron RAF|No. 501 Squadron]].{{sfn|Caldwell|1996|pp=52\u201353}} Neither squadron operated the Spitfire at this time.

Holland.{{sfn|Mason|1969|pp=234\u2013235}} The day after ''Adlertag'', he claimed a Hurricane from either [[No. 32 Squadron RAF|No. 32]] or No. 615 Squadron. This claim was not confirmed.{{sfn|Caldwell|1996|p=56}} 32 Squadron suffered damage to three Hurricanes in force-landings after aerial combat; all pilots unhurt. British sources attribute the loss of two pilots and two Hurricanes from 615 Squadron to [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]]s.{{sfn|Mason|1969|pp=246\u2013247}}\n\nOn [[The Hardest Day|18 August]], Sch\u00f6pfel fought in the large air battles which characterised the Battle of Britain. Sch\u00f6pfel led III. ''Gruppe'' of JG&nbsp;26 and Bf&nbsp;109s from [[Jagdgeschwader 3|''Jagdgeschwader'' 3]], 40 in total, across the [[Strait of Dover]]  to sweep the skies clear ahead of the main raid. Some 25 miles behind him were the 27 Do 17s of I. and III./[[KG 76]] escorted by 20 Bf 110s that were to strike [[RAF Kenley]].{{sfn|Price|2010|p=65}} As the advance led by Sch\u00f6pfel made their way past the coast it spotted a vic-formation of RAF fighters. They were Hurricanes of 501 Squadron which were conducting wide spirals to gain height. Sch\u00f6pfel bounced them and claimed four in two minutes killing one pilot and wounding three others. As he departed other members of his ''Geschwader'' dived on the Squadron and an inconclusive dogfight ensued. Sch\u00f6pfel's victims were Donald McKay and [[Pilot Officer]]s J.W Bland, Pilot Officer [[Ken Lee (RAF officer)|Kenneth Lee]] and F. Kozlowski. Bland was the only one killed.{{sfn|Franks|1997|pp=59\u201360}}{{sfn|Price|2010|pp=68\u201369}} This combat took place over [[Canterbury]] in the timeframe 13:55 to 13:56.{{sfn|Caldwell|1996|p=60}} Lee, who was wounded, [[parachute|bailed out]] near [[Whitstable]].{{sfn|Goss|2018|p=90}}\n\n===Group commander===\nOn 22 August, Galland was appointed ''[[Geschwaderkommodore]]'' (wing commander) of JG&nbsp;26 and Sch\u00f6pfel, who had led 9.

''Gruppe'' moved to a makeshift airfield at [[Coquelles]], close to [[Calais]] on the English Channel. There, they began preparations for operating the then new [[Focke Wulf Fw 190]]&nbsp;A-1. The ''Gruppe'' was fully reequipped and operational with the Fw&nbsp;190 in mid-November 1941.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|Rodeike|Bock|2003|pp=541, 543}}\n\n===Wing commander===\n[[File:JG26-Emblem.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|right|Emblem of JG 26]]\nOn 5 December 1941, Galland was appointed ''[[General der Jagdflieger]]'' (General of Fighters). In consequence of Galland's advance in command responsibility, Sch\u00f6pfel succeeded him as ''Geschwaderkommodore'' of JG&nbsp;26 on 6 December and ''Hauptmann'' [[Josef Priller]] became the new ''Gruppenkommandeur'' of III. ''Gruppe''.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|Rodeike|Bock|2003|pp=464, 544}} Three days later, he was awarded the [[German Cross]] in Gold ({{Lang|de|Deutsches Kreuz in Gold}}) on 9 December.{{sfn|Matthews|Foreman|2015|p=1167}} In December, he was also promoted to ''[[Major (Germany)|Major]]'' (major).{{sfn|Goss|2018|p=90}} \n\nIn February 1942 he led III.

The objective of this operation was to give the German [[battleship]]s {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} and the [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}} fighter protection in the breakout from [[Brest, France|Brest]] to Germany. The [[Channel Dash]] operation (11\u201313 February 1942) by the [[Kriegsmarine]] was codenamed Operation Cerberus by the Germans. In support of this, the Luftwaffe, formulated an [[air superiority]] plan dubbed Operation Donnerkeil for the protection of the three German capital ships.{{sfn|Caldwell|1996|pp=204\u2013210}} They intercepted [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Eugene Esmonde]], acting as [[Squadron Leader]], No. 825 Squadron [[Fleet Air Arm]], in a [[Fairey Swordfish]]. Frail and slow, the Swordfish forced German pilots to lower their undercarriages to prevent overshooting the biplanes. In the event all six Swordfish of this unit were shot down. Several managed to fire off their torpedoes at German ships but none found their mark. Lieutenant Commander Esmonde was shot down and killed by an Fw 190.{{sfn|Weal|1996b|p=17}}\n\nSch\u00f6pfel claimed an unconfirmed aerial victory over a [[No. 411 Squadron RAF|No. 411 Squadron]] Spitfire on 24 March.

''Gruppe'' of [[Jagdgeschwader 54|''Jagdgeschwader'' 54]] (JG&nbsp;54\u201454th Fighter Wing) for a month. This was based in Germany on Reich Defense, and he mentored the newly promoted ''Gruppenkommandeur'' [[Siegfried Schnell]] who had previously commanded 9./JG 2 alongside Sch\u00f6pfel on the Channel Front. Then, on 1 June 1944, he was appointed ''Geschwaderkommodore'' of the newly formed [[Jagdgeschwader 4]], also based on the Channel Front in [[Defense of the Reich]]. The original ''Gruppe'' I./JG 4, formed in mid 1943, had previously been based in Romania defending the oilfields, and was currently based in northern Italy. The new II. and III./JG 4 ''Gruppen'' were authorised in mid July, and I./JG 4 transferred to Germany to join them to bring his ''Geschwader'' up to full strength. However, on 6 August wounded he was shot down near Schwerin flying Bf&nbsp;109&nbsp;G-6 (''Werknummer'' 440728\u2014factory number).{{sfn|Goss|2018|p=91}} His injuries were serious enough that he had to give up his command on 6 August to ''Oberstleutnant'' [[Gerhard Michalski]].{{sfn|Goss|2018|p=91}}\n\nIn October 1944 Sch\u00f6pfel was appointed to the newly created role of ''[[Jagdfliegerf\u00fchrer Ungarn]]'' (Fighter Leader Hungary). In February 1945 he commanded the ''[[Luftkriegsschule 2]]'' (training school) at [[Gatow]]. On 10 April he was appointed the final ''Geschwaderkommodore'' of [[Jagdgeschwader 6|''Jagdgeschwader'' 6]] (JG&nbsp;6\u20146th Fighter Wing) based in northern Czechoslovakia.\n\nAfter serving on the Eastern Front for approximately one month, Sch\u00f6pfel was captured by Soviet forces, and was interned for four and a half years in the Soviet Union. He returned to Germany upon his release in December 1949.{{sfn|Obermaier|1989|p=200}}{{sfn|Goss|2018|p=91}}\n\n==Later life==\nHe took jobs as a chauffeur and a merchant before obtaining an executive position with Air Lloyd in Bonn in the 1960s, in an office next to his former commander Adolf Galland.

As a [[fighter ace]], he is credited with 45 aerial victories claimed in approximately 700 combat missions, all of which on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]].\n\nBorn in [[Erfurt]], Sch\u00f6pfel grew up in the [[Weimar Republic]] and [[Nazi Germany]] and joined the German police force. In 1936, he transferred to the Luftwaffe and following flight training was posted to a fighter wing. In September 1939, Sch\u00f6pfel became a squadron leader in [[Jagdgeschwader 26|''Jagdgeschwader'' 26]] \"Schlageter\" (JG&nbsp;26\u201426th Fighter Wing). Flying with this wing, Sch\u00f6pfel claimed his first aerial victory on 19 May 1940 during the [[Battle of France]]. In August 1941, he was given command of III. ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933\u201345)#Gruppe|Gruppe]]'' of JG&nbsp;26. During the [[Battle of Britain]], he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] on 11 September for 20 aerial victories claimed. In December 1941, Sch\u00f6pfel was appointed ''[[Geschwaderkommodore]]'' (wing commander) of JG&nbsp;26, a position he held until January 1943.\n\nSch\u00f6pfel then held various staff positions with ''[[Jagdfliegerf\u00fchrer Bretagne]]'', ''[[Jagdfliegerf\u00fchrer Sizilien]]'' and ''[[Jagdfliegerf\u00fchrer Norwegen]]''. In May 1944, he was posted to [[Jagdgeschwader 54|''Jagdgeschwader'' 54]] (JG&nbsp;54\u201454th Fighter Wing) and in June was given command of [[Jagdgeschwader 4|''Jagdgeschwader'' 4]] (JG&nbsp;4\u20144th Fighter Wing). In April 1945, he was appointed commander of [[Jagdgeschwader 6|''Jagdgeschwader'' 6]] (JG&nbsp;6\u20146th Fighter Wing). At the end of the war, he became a Soviet [[prisoner of war]] and was released in December 1949. Sch\u00f6pfel died on 15 May 2003 in [[Bergisch Gladbach]].\n\n==Early life and career==\nSch\u00f6pfel was born on 19 December 1912 at [[Erfurt]], at the time in [[Province of Saxony]] of the [[German Empire]]. Serving with the ''[[Landespolizei]]'' (state police), he transferred to the [[Luftwaffe]] in 1936 and held the rank of ''[[Oberf\u00e4hnrich]]'' (officer cadet).{{sfn|Obermaier|1989|p=200}} Following flight training,{{refn|Flight training in the Luftwaffe progressed through the levels A1, A2 and B1, B2, referred to as A/B flight training.

The campaign was carried out by the armed forces of the [[South Vietnam|Republic of Vietnam]] (South Vietnam) between 8 February and 25 March 1971, during the [[Vietnam War]]. The United States provided logistical, aerial, and artillery support to the operation, but its ground forces were prohibited by law from entering Laotian territory. The objective of the campaign was the disruption of a possible future offensive by the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN), whose logistical system within Laos was known as the [[Ho Chi Minh trail|Ho Chi Minh Trail]] (the Truong Son Road to [[North Vietnam]]).\n\nBy launching such a spoiling attack against PAVN's long-established logistical system, the American and South Vietnamese high commands hoped to resolve several pressing issues. A quick victory in Laos would bolster the morale and confidence of the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN), which was already high in the wake of the successful [[Cambodian Campaign]] of 1970. It would also serve as proof positive that South Vietnamese forces could defend their nation in the face of the continuing withdrawal of U.S. ground combat forces from the theater. The operation would be, therefore, a test of that policy and ARVN's capability to operate effectively by itself.\n\nBecause of the South Vietnamese need for security which precluded thorough planning, an inability by the political and military leaders of the U.S. and South Vietnam to face military realities, and poor execution, Operation ''Lam Son 719'' collapsed when faced by the determined resistance of a skillful foe. The campaign was a disaster<ref name=\"Sander\"/> for the ARVN, demonstrating deficiencies in ARVN military leaders and that the best units of the ARVN could be defeated by PAVN<ref name=Tucker>Spencer C. Tucker , p.2471</ref> and destroying the confidence that had been built up over the previous three years.\n\n==Background==\nBetween 1959 and 1970, the Ho Chi Minh Trail had become the key logistical artery for PAVN and the [[Viet Cong]] (VC), in their effort to conduct military operations to topple the U.S.-supported government of South Vietnam and create a unified nation. Running from the southwestern corner of North Vietnam through southeastern Laos and into the western portions of South Vietnam, the trail system had been the target of continuous U.S. aerial interdiction efforts that had begun in 1966. Only small-scale covert operations in support of the air campaigns had, however, been conducted on the ground inside Laos to halt the flow of men and supplies on the trail.<ref>{{cite book|last=Van Staaveren|first=Jacob|title=Interdiction in Southern Laos|publisher=Center of Air Force History|year=1993|isbn=9781410220608|url=https://media.defense.gov/2010/Sep/27/2001329814/-1/-1/0/AFD-100927-078.pdf|page=}}{{PD-notice}}</ref><ref name=Nalty/><ref>{{cite book|last=Plaster|first=John|title=Secret Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines with the Elite Warriors of SOG|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2004|isbn=9781501183454|page=}}</ref>\n\nSince 1966, over 630,000 men, 100,000 tons of foodstuffs, 400,000 weapons, and 50,000 tons of ammunition had traveled through the maze of gravel and dirt roads, paths, and river transportation systems that crisscrossed southeastern Laos. The trail also linked up with a similar logistical system in neighboring [[Cambodia]] known as the [[Sihanouk Trail]].<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|65}} However, following [[1970 Cambodian coup d'\u00e9tat|the overthrow]] of Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]] in 1970, the pro-American [[Lon Nol]] regime had denied the use of the port of [[Sihanoukville (city)|Sihanoukville]] to communist shipping.

During the first phase U.S. forces inside South Vietnam would seize the border approaches and conduct diversionary operations. Next would come an ARVN armored/infantry attack along [[National Road 9 (Vietnam)|Route 9]] toward the Laotian town of [[Tchepone]], the perceived nexus of Base Area 604. The village was estimated to have had about 1,500 inhabitants in 1960; five years later, half of the residents had fled due to war; Operation Lam Son 719 then destroyed the village and left it deserted.<ref>{{cite book|last=Collins|first=John|title=Military Geography for Professionals and the Public|publisher=National Defense University Press|year=1998|isbn=9781330965832|page=372}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Miller|first=John|title=The Co-Vans: US Marine Advisors in Vietnam|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=2000|isbn=9781557505491|page=146}}</ref> This advance would be protected by a series of leap-frogging aerial infantry assaults to cover the northern and southern flanks of the main column.

It was hoped that the reference to the previous operation would confuse Hanoi as to the actual target of the proposed incursion. The ARVN's portion was given the title ''Lam Son 719'', after the village of Lam Son, birthplace of the legendary Vietnamese patriot [[L\u00ea L\u1ee3i]], who had defeated an invading Chinese army in 1427. The numerical designation came from the year, 1971, and the main axis of the attack, Route 9.\n\nThe decisions had been made at the highest levels and planning had been completed, but valuable time had been lost. The South Vietnamese were about to begin their largest, most complex, and most important operation of the war. The lack of time for adequate planning and preparation, as well as the absence of any real questioning about military realities and the capabilities of the ARVN were going to prove decisive.<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|66}} On 29 January President Nixon gave his final approval for the operation. On the following day, Operation ''Dewey Canyon II'' was under way.\n\n==Operations==\n===Dewey Canyon II===\nAny offensive planning by the U.S. was, however, limited by the passage on 29 December 1970 of the [[Cooper-Church Amendment]], which prohibited U.S. ground forces and advisors from entering Laos. ''Dewey Canyon II'' would, therefore, be conducted within territorial South Vietnam in order to reopen Route 9 all the way to the old [[Khe Sanh Combat Base]], which had been abandoned by U.S. forces in 1968. The base would be reopened and would then serve as the logistical hub and airhead of the ARVN incursion. U.S. combat engineers were tasked with clearing Route 9 and rehabilitating Khe Sanh while infantry and mechanized units secured a line of communications along the length of the road. American artillery units would support the ARVN effort within Laos from the South Vietnamese side of the border while Army logisticians coordinated the entire supply effort for the South Vietnamese. Air support for the incursion would be provided by the aircraft of the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, and U.S. Army aviation units were tasked with providing complete helicopter support for the ARVN operation.<ref name=Nolan/>{{rp|31}}\n\nU.S. forces earmarked for these missions included: four battalions of the 108th Artillery Group; two battalions of the 45th Engineer Group; the 101st Airborne Division; six battalions of the 101st Aviation Group; the 1st Brigade of the [[U.S. 5th Infantry Division|5th (Mechanized) Infantry Division]] (reinforced by two mechanized, one cavalry, one tank, and one airmobile infantry battalions; and the two battalions of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the [[23rd Infantry Division (United States)|23rd Infantry Division]].<ref name=Stanton/>{{rp|334}}\n[[File:Khe Sanh reoccuppied, Operation Lam Son 719, 12 February 1971.tif|thumb|right|Helicopters and supply vehicles at Khe Sanh, 12 February 1971]]\nOn the morning of 30 January, armor/engineer elements of the 1st Brigade, 5th Infantry Division headed west on Route 9 while the brigade's infantry elements were helilifted directly into the Khe Sanh area.

At the combat base, poor weather, obstacles, land mines, and unexploded ordnance pushed the rehabilitation of the airstrip (estimated by U.S. engineers at four days) a week behind schedule. As a response, a completely new airstrip had to be built and the first aircraft arrived on 15 February.<ref name=Palmer/>{{rp|306}} PAVN resistance was almost nonexistent and American casualties were light; with no previous allied presence around Khe Sanh, the North Vietnamese had seen no need to maintain large forces in the area.<ref name=Nolan/>{{rp|82}} However, General Sutherland believed that the advance to Khe Sanh had been a race between American and PAVN forces, and the U.S. had won.<ref name=Nolan/>{{rp|82}}\n\nIn order to preserve the security of the upcoming South Vietnamese operation, General Abrams had imposed a rare press embargo on the reporting of troop movements, but it was to no avail. Communist and non-American news agencies released reports of the build-up and even before the lifting of the embargo on 4 February, speculation concerning the offensive was front page news in the U.S.<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|72}} As had been the case during the Cambodian campaign, the government of Laos was not notified in advance of the intended operation.

General Abrams believed that unlike Cambodia, the North Vietnamese would stand and fight for the Laotian Base Areas. As early as 11 December he had reported to Admiral McCain that:\n<blockquote>strong infantry, armor, and artillery formations were in southern Laos...formidable air defenses were deployed...the mountainous, jungle-covered terrain was an added liability. Natural clearings for helicopter landing zones were scarce and likely to be heavily defended. The bulk of the enemy's combat units were in the vicinity of Tchepone and PAVN could be expected to defend his base areas and logistics centers against any allied operation.<ref name=Sorley/>{{rp|235-6}}</blockquote>\nA prescient [[CIA]] study released in December 1970 echoed Abrams' concerns and was supported by a 21 January memorandum which \"was remarkably accurate with respect to the nature, pattern, and all-out intensity of [PAVN] reactions.\"<ref name=Prados/>{{rp|321}}\n\nMACV intelligence, on the other hand was convinced that the incursion would be only lightly opposed. Tactical air strikes and artillery preparations would neutralize the estimated 170 to 200 anti-aircraft artillery weapons believed to be in the area, and the threat posed by PAVN armored units was considered minimal. North Vietnamese reinforcement capability was set at 14 days by two divisions north of the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|DMZ]], and it was hoped that diversionary operations would occupy them for the duration of the operation.<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|72}} Unfortunately, when North Vietnamese reinforcements did arrive, they did not come from the north as expected, but from Base Area 611 and the A Shau Valley to the south, where eight regiments, all supported by organic artillery units, were within two weeks marching range.\n\nThe North Vietnamese were expecting some sort of operation as early as 26 January when the text of an intercepted radio message read \"It has been determined that the enemy may strike into our cargo carrier system in order to cut it off...Prepare to mobilize and strike the enemy hard. Be vigilant.\"<ref name=Sorley/>{{rp|241}}\n\nThe tactical air strikes that were to precede the incursion and suppress known anti-aircraft positions were suspended two days prior to the operation due to poor flying weather. After a massive preliminary artillery bombardment and 11 [[B-52 Stratofortress]] missions, the incursion began on 8 February, when a 4,000-man ARVN armor/infantry task force consisting of the 3rd Armored Brigade and the 1st and 8th Airborne Battalions, advanced west unopposed along Route 9. To cover the northern flank, ARVN Airborne and Ranger elements were deployed to the north of the main advance. The 39th Ranger Battalion was helilifted into a Landing Zone (LZ) known as Ranger North ({{Coord|16.744|N|106.493|E|display=inline}}) while the 21st Ranger Battalion moved into Ranger South ({{Coord|16.736|N|106.472|E|display=inline}}). These outposts were to serve as tripwires for any communist advance into the zone of the ARVN incursion. Meanwhile, the 2nd Airborne Battalion occupied Fire Support Base (FSB) 30 ({{Coord|16.696|N|106.486|E|display=inline}}) while the 3rd Airborne Brigade Headquarters and the 3rd Airborne Battalion went into FSB 31 ({{Coord|16.715|N|106.426|E|display=inline}}).

Almost immediately, supporting helicopters began to take fire from the heights, which allowed PAVN gunners to fire down on the aircraft from pre-registered machine gun and mortar positions. Making matters worse for the advance, Route 9 was in poor condition, so poor in fact that only tracked vehicles and jeeps could make the westward journey. This threw the burden of reinforcement and resupply onto the aviation assets. The helicopter units then became the essential mode of logistical support, a role that was made increasingly more dangerous due to low cloud cover and incessant anti-aircraft fire.<ref name=Airwar>{{cite book|last=Nalty|first=Bernard C.

Hanoi's attention was riveted on another diversionary maneuver being conducted by a U.S. naval task force off the coast of the North Vietnam. This force conducted all of the maneuvers necessary for the carrying out of an amphibious landing only 20 kilometers off the city of [[Vinh]].<ref name=Prados/>{{rp|338}} Hanoi's preoccupation with a possible invasion did not last long. Its B-70 Corps commanded three divisions in the incursion area, the [[304th Division (Vietnam)|304th]], [[308 Division (Vietnam)|308th]] and [[320th Division (Vietnam)|320th]]. The [[2nd Division (Vietnam)|2nd Division]] had also moved up from the south to the Tchepone area and then began to move east to meet the ARVN threat. By early March, Hanoi had massed 36,000 troops in the area, outnumbering the South Vietnamese force by two-to-one.<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|76}}\n\nThe method chosen by PAVN to defeat the invasion was to first isolate the northern firebases by utilizing anti-aircraft artillery. The outposts would then be pounded by round-the-clock mortar, artillery, and rocket fire. Although the ARVN firebases were themselves equipped with artillery, their guns were quickly outranged by PAVN's Soviet-supplied [[122 mm howitzer 2A18 (D-30)|122mm]] and [[130 mm towed field gun M1954 (M-46)|130mm]] pieces, which simply stood off and pounded the positions at will. The defensive edge that could have been provided by the utilization of tactical B-52 bomber strikes was nullified by the close-in tactics of the PAVN.<ref name=Airwar/>{{rp|262}} Massed ground attacks, supported by artillery and armor, would then finish the job.\n\nAs early as 18 February, PAVN forces had begun attacks by fire on bases Ranger North and South.

It was evacuated on the following day. FSB 31 was the next ARVN position to fall under the hammer. Airborne Division commander General \u0110\u1ed1ng had opposed stationing his elite paratroopers in static defensive positions and felt that his men's usual aggressiveness had been stifled.<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|82}} Vicious PAVN anti-aircraft fire made reinforcement and resupply of the firebase impossible. General \u0110\u1ed1ng then ordered elements of the 17th Armored Squadron to advance north from A Luoi to reinforce the base.

Smoke, dust and haze precluded observation by an American forward air control (FAC) aircraft, which was flying above {{convert|4,000|ft}} to avoid anti-aircraft fire. When a U.S. Air Force [[F-4 Phantom]] jet was shot down in the area, the FAC left the area of the battle to direct a rescue effort for the downed aircraft crew, sealing the fate of the base.

Although American leaders and news correspondents had focused on the town as one of ''Lam Son 719'''s main objectives, the PAVN logistical network actually bypassed the ruined town to the west.

PAVN responded by increasing its daily artillery bombardments of the firebases, notably Lolo and Hope.\n\n===Retreat===\nTheir goal in Laos seemingly achieved, President Thieu and General L\u00e3m ordered a withdrawal of ARVN forces beginning on 9 March that was to continue through the rest of the month, destroying Base Area 604 and any supplies discovered in their path. General Abrams implored Thieu to reinforce the troops in Laos and that they keep disrupting the area until the beginning of the rainy season. By the time this request was made, South Vietnam possessed only one Marine brigade in its entire national reserve. Thieu responded to Abrams by requesting that U.S. forces be deployed to Laos, knowing that such an option was impossible. <ref name=Sorley/>{{rp|255}} The battle was shifting to Hanoi's advantage. Anti-aircraft fire remained devastating and the PAVN had no trouble resupplying or reinforcing their troops in the battle area. As soon as it became evident that ARVN forces had begun a withdrawal, the PAVN increased its efforts to destroy them before they could reach South Vietnam. Anti-aircraft fire was increased to halt or slow helicopter resupply or evacuation efforts, the undermanned firebases were attacked, and ARVN ground forces had to run a gauntlet of ambushes along Route 9.\n[[File:Fire Support Base Lolo being overun during Operation Lam Son 719 - 1971.jpg|thumb|right|Fire Support Base Lolo falls to PAVN forces]]\nOnly a well-disciplined and coordinated army could have executed an orderly withdrawal in the face of such a determined enemy and the South Vietnamese force in Laos was neither. The retreat quickly devolved into a rout.<ref name=Karnow/>{{rp|630}} One by one, the isolated firebases were closed out or overrun by the PAVN and each withdrawal was costly. On 21 March, South Vietnamese Marines at FSB Delta ({{Coord|16.550|N|106.539|E|display=inline}}), south of Route 9, came under intense ground and artillery attacks. During an attempted extraction of the force, seven helicopters were shot down and another 50 were damaged, ending the evacuation attempt.<ref name=Nalty/>{{rp|269}} The Marines finally broke out of the encirclement and marched to the safety of FSB Hotel, which was then hastily abandoned. During the extraction of the 2nd ARVN Regiment, 28 of the 40 helicopters participating were damaged.<ref name=Stanton/>{{rp|336\u20137}}\n\nThe armored task force fared little better, losing many of its vehicles to  breakdowns or ambushes. During the retreat, the task force lost 60 percent of its tanks and half of its APCs. It also abandoned 54 105mm and 28 155mm howitzers.<ref name=Nalty/>{{rp|271}} This equipment then had to be destroyed by U.S. aircraft in order to prevent its capture and reuse by the PAVN. Covering the retreat on Route 9 was the 1st Armored Brigade, which had been assigned to the ARVN Airborne Division. When informed by a prisoner that two PAVN regiments waited in ambush ahead, the commander of the brigade, Colonel Nguyen Trong Luat, notified General \u0110\u1ed1ng of the situation. The Airborne commander airmobiled forces in and cleared the road, but never bothered to inform Colonel Luat.<ref name=Nolan/>{{rp|313}} In order to avoid destruction on Route 9, Luat then ordered the column to abandon the road only {{convert|5|mi}} from the South Vietnamese border and plunged onto a jungle trail looking for an unguarded way back.\n[[File:Mortar impacts near two 1st Marine Aircraft Wing AH-1G Cobra helicopters from Marine Light Helicopter Squadron 367, Khe Sanh Combat Base.tif|thumb|right|Mortar impacts near two AH-1G Cobra helicopters from [[HMLA-367]], Khe Sanh Combat Base]]\nThe trail came to a dead end at the steep banks of the Se Pone River and the force was trapped.

The military expansion of the Ho Chi Minh Trail to the west which had begun in 1970 at the expense of Laotian forces, was quickly accelerated. Laotian troops were soon withdrawing toward the [[Mekong River]] and a logistical artery {{convert|60|mi}} in width was soon expanded to {{convert|90|mi}}. Another result of the operation was a firm decision by the Politburo to launch a major conventional invasion of South Vietnam in early 1972, paving the way for the ''Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 Offensive'', known in the west as the [[Easter Offensive]].<ref name=Davidson/>{{rp|699}}\n\nDuring ''Lam Son 719'', the U.S. planners had believed that any North Vietnamese forces that opposed the incursion would be caught in the open and decimated by the application of American aerial might, either in the form of tactical airstrikes or airmobility, which would provide ARVN troops with superior battlefield maneuvering capability. Firepower, as it turned out, was decisive, but \"it went in favor of the enemy... Airpower played an important, but not decisive role, in that it prevented a defeat from becoming a disaster that might have been so complete as to encourage the North Vietnamese army to keep moving right into Quang Tri Province.\"<ref name=Tilford/>{{rp|200-1}}\n\nThe number of helicopters destroyed or damaged during the operation shocked the proponents of U.S. Army aviation and prompted a reevaluation of basic airmobile doctrine. The 101st Airborne Division alone, for example, had 84 of its aircraft destroyed and another 430 damaged. During ''Lam Son 719'' American helicopters had flown more than 160,000 sorties and 19 U.S. Army aviators had been killed, 59 were wounded, and 11 were missing at its conclusion.<ref name=Nalty/>{{rp|273}} South Vietnamese helicopters had flown an additional 5,500 missions.

The campaign was carried out by the armed forces of the [[South Vietnam|Republic of Vietnam]] (South Vietnam) between 8 February and 25 March 1971, during the [[Vietnam War]]. The United States provided logistical, aerial, and artillery support to the operation, but its ground forces were prohibited by law from entering Laotian territory. The objective of the campaign was the disruption of a possible future offensive by the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN), whose logistical system within Laos was known as the [[Ho Chi Minh trail|Ho Chi Minh Trail]] (the Truong Son Road to [[North Vietnam]]).\n\nBy launching such a spoiling attack against PAVN's long-established logistical system, the American and South Vietnamese high commands hoped to resolve several pressing issues. A quick victory in Laos would bolster the morale and confidence of the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN), which was already high in the wake of the successful [[Cambodian Campaign]] of 1970. It would also serve as proof positive that South Vietnamese forces could defend their nation in the face of the continuing withdrawal of U.S. ground combat forces from the theater. The operation would be, therefore, a test of that policy and ARVN's capability to operate effectively by itself.\n\nBecause of the South Vietnamese need for security which precluded thorough planning, an inability by the political and military leaders of the U.S. and South Vietnam to face military realities, and poor execution, Operation ''Lam Son 719'' collapsed when faced by the determined resistance of a skillful foe. The campaign was a disaster<ref name=\"Sander\"/> for the ARVN, demonstrating deficiencies in ARVN military leaders and that the best units of the ARVN could be defeated by PAVN<ref name=Tucker>Spencer C. Tucker , p.2471</ref> and destroying the confidence that had been built up over the previous three years.\n\n==Background==\nBetween 1959 and 1970, the Ho Chi Minh Trail had become the key logistical artery for PAVN and the [[Viet Cong]] (VC), in their effort to conduct military operations to topple the U.S.-supported government of South Vietnam and create a unified nation. Running from the southwestern corner of North Vietnam through southeastern Laos and into the western portions of South Vietnam, the trail system had been the target of continuous U.S. aerial interdiction efforts that had begun in 1966. Only small-scale covert operations in support of the air campaigns had, however, been conducted on the ground inside Laos to halt the flow of men and supplies on the trail.<ref>{{cite book|last=Van Staaveren|first=Jacob|title=Interdiction in Southern Laos|publisher=Center of Air Force History|year=1993|isbn=9781410220608|url=https://media.defense.gov/2010/Sep/27/2001329814/-1/-1/0/AFD-100927-078.pdf|page=}}{{PD-notice}}</ref><ref name=Nalty/><ref>{{cite book|last=Plaster|first=John|title=Secret Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines with the Elite Warriors of SOG|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2004|isbn=9781501183454|page=}}</ref>\n\nSince 1966, over 630,000 men, 100,000 tons of foodstuffs, 400,000 weapons, and 50,000 tons of ammunition had traveled through the maze of gravel and dirt roads, paths, and river transportation systems that crisscrossed southeastern Laos.

During the first phase U.S. forces inside South Vietnam would seize the border approaches and conduct diversionary operations. Next would come an ARVN armored/infantry attack along [[National Road 9 (Vietnam)|Route 9]] toward the Laotian town of [[Tchepone]], the perceived nexus of Base Area 604. The village was estimated to have had about 1,500 inhabitants in 1960; five years later, half of the residents had fled due to war; Operation Lam Son 719 then destroyed the village and left it deserted.<ref>{{cite book|last=Collins|first=John|title=Military Geography for Professionals and the Public|publisher=National Defense University Press|year=1998|isbn=9781330965832|page=372}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Miller|first=John|title=The Co-Vans: US Marine Advisors in Vietnam|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=2000|isbn=9781557505491|page=146}}</ref> This advance would be protected by a series of leap-frogging aerial infantry assaults to cover the northern and southern flanks of the main column.

It was hoped that the reference to the previous operation would confuse Hanoi as to the actual target of the proposed incursion. The ARVN's portion was given the title ''Lam Son 719'', after the village of Lam Son, birthplace of the legendary Vietnamese patriot [[L\u00ea L\u1ee3i]], who had defeated an invading Chinese army in 1427. The numerical designation came from the year, 1971, and the main axis of the attack, Route 9.\n\nThe decisions had been made at the highest levels and planning had been completed, but valuable time had been lost. The South Vietnamese were about to begin their largest, most complex, and most important operation of the war. The lack of time for adequate planning and preparation, as well as the absence of any real questioning about military realities and the capabilities of the ARVN were going to prove decisive.<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|66}} On 29 January President Nixon gave his final approval for the operation. On the following day, Operation ''Dewey Canyon II'' was under way.\n\n==Operations==\n===Dewey Canyon II===\nAny offensive planning by the U.S. was, however, limited by the passage on 29 December 1970 of the [[Cooper-Church Amendment]], which prohibited U.S. ground forces and advisors from entering Laos. ''Dewey Canyon II'' would, therefore, be conducted within territorial South Vietnam in order to reopen Route 9 all the way to the old [[Khe Sanh Combat Base]], which had been abandoned by U.S. forces in 1968. The base would be reopened and would then serve as the logistical hub and airhead of the ARVN incursion. U.S. combat engineers were tasked with clearing Route 9 and rehabilitating Khe Sanh while infantry and mechanized units secured a line of communications along the length of the road. American artillery units would support the ARVN effort within Laos from the South Vietnamese side of the border while Army logisticians coordinated the entire supply effort for the South Vietnamese. Air support for the incursion would be provided by the aircraft of the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, and U.S. Army aviation units were tasked with providing complete helicopter support for the ARVN operation.<ref name=Nolan/>{{rp|31}}\n\nU.S. forces earmarked for these missions included: four battalions of the 108th Artillery Group; two battalions of the 45th Engineer Group; the 101st Airborne Division; six battalions of the 101st Aviation Group; the 1st Brigade of the [[U.S. 5th Infantry Division|5th (Mechanized) Infantry Division]] (reinforced by two mechanized, one cavalry, one tank, and one airmobile infantry battalions; and the two battalions of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the [[23rd Infantry Division (United States)|23rd Infantry Division]].<ref name=Stanton/>{{rp|334}}\n[[File:Khe Sanh reoccuppied, Operation Lam Son 719, 12 February 1971.tif|thumb|right|Helicopters and supply vehicles at Khe Sanh, 12 February 1971]]\nOn the morning of 30 January, armor/engineer elements of the 1st Brigade, 5th Infantry Division headed west on Route 9 while the brigade's infantry elements were helilifted directly into the Khe Sanh area.

At the combat base, poor weather, obstacles, land mines, and unexploded ordnance pushed the rehabilitation of the airstrip (estimated by U.S. engineers at four days) a week behind schedule. As a response, a completely new airstrip had to be built and the first aircraft arrived on 15 February.<ref name=Palmer/>{{rp|306}} PAVN resistance was almost nonexistent and American casualties were light; with no previous allied presence around Khe Sanh, the North Vietnamese had seen no need to maintain large forces in the area.<ref name=Nolan/>{{rp|82}} However, General Sutherland believed that the advance to Khe Sanh had been a race between American and PAVN forces, and the U.S. had won.<ref name=Nolan/>{{rp|82}}\n\nIn order to preserve the security of the upcoming South Vietnamese operation, General Abrams had imposed a rare press embargo on the reporting of troop movements, but it was to no avail. Communist and non-American news agencies released reports of the build-up and even before the lifting of the embargo on 4 February, speculation concerning the offensive was front page news in the U.S.<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|72}} As had been the case during the Cambodian campaign, the government of Laos was not notified in advance of the intended operation.

General Abrams believed that unlike Cambodia, the North Vietnamese would stand and fight for the Laotian Base Areas. As early as 11 December he had reported to Admiral McCain that:\n<blockquote>strong infantry, armor, and artillery formations were in southern Laos...formidable air defenses were deployed...the mountainous, jungle-covered terrain was an added liability. Natural clearings for helicopter landing zones were scarce and likely to be heavily defended. The bulk of the enemy's combat units were in the vicinity of Tchepone and PAVN could be expected to defend his base areas and logistics centers against any allied operation.<ref name=Sorley/>{{rp|235-6}}</blockquote>\nA prescient [[CIA]] study released in December 1970 echoed Abrams' concerns and was supported by a 21 January memorandum which \"was remarkably accurate with respect to the nature, pattern, and all-out intensity of [PAVN] reactions.\"<ref name=Prados/>{{rp|321}}\n\nMACV intelligence, on the other hand was convinced that the incursion would be only lightly opposed. Tactical air strikes and artillery preparations would neutralize the estimated 170 to 200 anti-aircraft artillery weapons believed to be in the area, and the threat posed by PAVN armored units was considered minimal. North Vietnamese reinforcement capability was set at 14 days by two divisions north of the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone|DMZ]], and it was hoped that diversionary operations would occupy them for the duration of the operation.<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|72}} Unfortunately, when North Vietnamese reinforcements did arrive, they did not come from the north as expected, but from Base Area 611 and the A Shau Valley to the south, where eight regiments, all supported by organic artillery units, were within two weeks marching range.\n\nThe North Vietnamese were expecting some sort of operation as early as 26 January when the text of an intercepted radio message read \"It has been determined that the enemy may strike into our cargo carrier system in order to cut it off...Prepare to mobilize and strike the enemy hard. Be vigilant.\"<ref name=Sorley/>{{rp|241}}\n\nThe tactical air strikes that were to precede the incursion and suppress known anti-aircraft positions were suspended two days prior to the operation due to poor flying weather. After a massive preliminary artillery bombardment and 11 [[B-52 Stratofortress]] missions, the incursion began on 8 February, when a 4,000-man ARVN armor/infantry task force consisting of the 3rd Armored Brigade and the 1st and 8th Airborne Battalions, advanced west unopposed along Route 9. To cover the northern flank, ARVN Airborne and Ranger elements were deployed to the north of the main advance. The 39th Ranger Battalion was helilifted into a Landing Zone (LZ) known as Ranger North ({{Coord|16.744|N|106.493|E|display=inline}}) while the 21st Ranger Battalion moved into Ranger South ({{Coord|16.736|N|106.472|E|display=inline}}). These outposts were to serve as tripwires for any communist advance into the zone of the ARVN incursion. Meanwhile, the 2nd Airborne Battalion occupied Fire Support Base (FSB) 30 ({{Coord|16.696|N|106.486|E|display=inline}}) while the 3rd Airborne Brigade Headquarters and the 3rd Airborne Battalion went into FSB 31 ({{Coord|16.715|N|106.426|E|display=inline}}).

Almost immediately, supporting helicopters began to take fire from the heights, which allowed PAVN gunners to fire down on the aircraft from pre-registered machine gun and mortar positions. Making matters worse for the advance, Route 9 was in poor condition, so poor in fact that only tracked vehicles and jeeps could make the westward journey. This threw the burden of reinforcement and resupply onto the aviation assets.

Hanoi's attention was riveted on another diversionary maneuver being conducted by a U.S. naval task force off the coast of the North Vietnam. This force conducted all of the maneuvers necessary for the carrying out of an amphibious landing only 20 kilometers off the city of [[Vinh]].<ref name=Prados/>{{rp|338}} Hanoi's preoccupation with a possible invasion did not last long. Its B-70 Corps commanded three divisions in the incursion area, the [[304th Division (Vietnam)|304th]], [[308 Division (Vietnam)|308th]] and [[320th Division (Vietnam)|320th]]. The [[2nd Division (Vietnam)|2nd Division]] had also moved up from the south to the Tchepone area and then began to move east to meet the ARVN threat. By early March, Hanoi had massed 36,000 troops in the area, outnumbering the South Vietnamese force by two-to-one.<ref name=Fulghum/>{{rp|76}}\n\nThe method chosen by PAVN to defeat the invasion was to first isolate the northern firebases by utilizing anti-aircraft artillery. The outposts would then be pounded by round-the-clock mortar, artillery, and rocket fire. Although the ARVN firebases were themselves equipped with artillery, their guns were quickly outranged by PAVN's Soviet-supplied [[122 mm howitzer 2A18 (D-30)|122mm]] and [[130 mm towed field gun M1954 (M-46)|130mm]] pieces, which simply stood off and pounded the positions at will. The defensive edge that could have been provided by the utilization of tactical B-52 bomber strikes was nullified by the close-in tactics of the PAVN.<ref name=Airwar/>{{rp|262}} Massed ground attacks, supported by artillery and armor, would then finish the job.\n\nAs early as 18 February, PAVN forces had begun attacks by fire on bases Ranger North and South.

When a U.S. Air Force [[F-4 Phantom]] jet was shot down in the area, the FAC left the area of the battle to direct a rescue effort for the downed aircraft crew, sealing the fate of the base.

Although American leaders and news correspondents had focused on the town as one of ''Lam Son 719'''s main objectives, the PAVN logistical network actually bypassed the ruined town to the west.

PAVN responded by increasing its daily artillery bombardments of the firebases, notably Lolo and Hope.\n\n===Retreat===\nTheir goal in Laos seemingly achieved, President Thieu and General L\u00e3m ordered a withdrawal of ARVN forces beginning on 9 March that was to continue through the rest of the month, destroying Base Area 604 and any supplies discovered in their path. General Abrams implored Thieu to reinforce the troops in Laos and that they keep disrupting the area until the beginning of the rainy season. By the time this request was made, South Vietnam possessed only one Marine brigade in its entire national reserve. Thieu responded to Abrams by requesting that U.S. forces be deployed to Laos, knowing that such an option was impossible. <ref name=Sorley/>{{rp|255}} The battle was shifting to Hanoi's advantage. Anti-aircraft fire remained devastating and the PAVN had no trouble resupplying or reinforcing their troops in the battle area. As soon as it became evident that ARVN forces had begun a withdrawal, the PAVN increased its efforts to destroy them before they could reach South Vietnam. Anti-aircraft fire was increased to halt or slow helicopter resupply or evacuation efforts, the undermanned firebases were attacked, and ARVN ground forces had to run a gauntlet of ambushes along Route 9.\n[[File:Fire Support Base Lolo being overun during Operation Lam Son 719 - 1971.jpg|thumb|right|Fire Support Base Lolo falls to PAVN forces]]\nOnly a well-disciplined and coordinated army can execute an orderly withdrawal in the face of a determined enemy and the South Vietnamese force in Laos was neither. The retreat quickly devolved into a rout.<ref name=Karnow/>{{rp|630}} One by one, the isolated firebases were closed out or overrun by the PAVN and each withdrawal was costly. On 21 March, South Vietnamese Marines at FSB Delta ({{Coord|16.550|N|106.539|E|display=inline}}), south of Route 9, came under intense ground and artillery attacks. During an attempted extraction of the force, seven helicopters were shot down and another 50 were damaged, ending the evacuation attempt.<ref name=Nalty/>{{rp|269}} The Marines finally broke out of the encirclement and marched to the safety of FSB Hotel, which was then hastily abandoned. During the extraction of the 2nd ARVN Regiment, 28 of the 40 helicopters participating were damaged.<ref name=Stanton/>{{rp|336\u20137}}\n\nThe armored task force fared little better, losing many of its vehicles to  breakdowns or ambushes. During the retreat, the task force lost 60 percent of its tanks and half of its APCs. It also abandoned 54 105mm and 28 155mm howitzers.<ref name=Nalty/>{{rp|271}} This equipment then had to be destroyed by U.S. aircraft in order to prevent its capture and reuse by the PAVN. Covering the retreat on Route 9 was the 1st Armored Brigade, which had been assigned to the ARVN Airborne Division. When informed by a prisoner that two PAVN regiments waited in ambush ahead, the commander of the brigade, Colonel Nguyen Trong Luat, notified General \u0110\u1ed1ng of the situation. The Airborne commander airmobiled forces in and cleared the road, but never bothered to inform Colonel Luat.<ref name=Nolan/>{{rp|313}} In order to avoid destruction on Route 9, Luat then ordered the column to abandon the road only {{convert|5|mi}} from the South Vietnamese border and plunged onto a jungle trail looking for an unguarded way back.\n[[File:Mortar impacts near two 1st Marine Aircraft Wing AH-1G Cobra helicopters from Marine Light Helicopter Squadron 367, Khe Sanh Combat Base.tif|thumb|right|Mortar impacts near two AH-1G Cobra helicopters from [[HMLA-367]], Khe Sanh Combat Base]]\nThe trail came to a dead end at the steep banks of the Se Pone River and the force was trapped.

The military expansion of the Ho Chi Minh Trail to the west which had begun in 1970 at the expense of Laotian forces, was quickly accelerated. Laotian troops were soon withdrawing toward the [[Mekong River]] and a logistical artery {{convert|60|mi}} in width was soon expanded to {{convert|90|mi}}. Another result of the operation was a firm decision by the Politburo to launch a major conventional invasion of South Vietnam in early 1972, paving the way for the ''Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 Offensive'', known in the west as the [[Easter Offensive]].<ref name=Davidson/>{{rp|699}}\n\nDuring ''Lam Son 719'', the U.S. planners had believed that any North Vietnamese forces that opposed the incursion would be caught in the open and decimated by the application of American aerial might, either in the form of tactical airstrikes or airmobility, which would provide ARVN troops with superior battlefield maneuvering capability. Firepower, as it turned out, was decisive, but \"it went in favor of the enemy... Airpower played an important, but not decisive role, in that it prevented a defeat from becoming a disaster that might have been so complete as to encourage the North Vietnamese army to keep moving right into Quang Tri Province.\"<ref name=Tilford/>{{rp|200-1}}\n\nThe number of helicopters destroyed or damaged during the operation shocked the proponents of U.S. Army aviation and prompted a reevaluation of basic airmobile doctrine. The 101st Airborne Division alone, for example, had 84 of its aircraft destroyed and another 430 damaged. During ''Lam Son 719'' American helicopters had flown more than 160,000 sorties and 19 U.S. Army aviators had been killed, 59 were wounded, and 11 were missing at its conclusion.<ref name=Nalty/>{{rp|273}} South Vietnamese helicopters had flown an additional 5,500 missions.

Seven U.S. fixed-wing aircraft were shot down over southern Laos: six from the Air Force (two dead/two missing) and one from the Navy (one aviator killed).{{citation needed|date = March 2013}}\n\n==References==\n{{AFHRA}}\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Journal articles===\n* {{cite news\n  | title =Indochina: The Soft-Sell Invasion\n  | publisher =Time\n  | date =1971-02-22\n  | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,902812,00.html\n  | accessdate = 2004-04-05 }}\n* Emerson, Gloria. \"Copters Return from Laos with the Dead.\" ''The New York Times'', 1971-03-03.\n* {{cite news\n  | title =Indochina: Tough Days on the Trail\n  | publisher =Time\n  | date =1971-03-08\n  | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904773,00.html\n  | accessdate = 2004-04-05 }}\n* {{cite news\n  | title =Showdown in Laos\n  | publisher =Time\n  | date =1971-03-15\n  | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904835,00.html\n  | accessdate = 2004-04-05 }}\n* Emerson, Gloria. \"Spirit of Saigon's Army Shaken in Laos.\", ''The New York Times'', 1971-03-28.\n* {{cite news\n  | title =Was It Worth It?\n  | publisher =Time\n  | date =1971-03-09\n  | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944297,00.html\n  | accessdate = 2004-04-05 }}\n* {{cite news\n  | title =The Invasion Ends\n  | publisher =Time\n  | date =1971-04-05\n  | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,876899,00.html\n  | accessdate = 2004-04-05 }}\n* {{cite news\n  | title =The Wan Edge of an Abyss\n  | publisher =Time\n  | date =1971-04-12\n  | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904963,00.html\n  | accessdate = 2004-04-05 }}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/vietnam/vietnamization/laos.aspx The Effects of Vietnamization on the Republic of Vietnam's Armed Forces, 1969\u20131972] by John Rincon\n* [http://www.comanchero.org/LamSon719.html]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150118011608/http://www.mrfa.org/vnstats.htm A list of Vietnam statistics.

Ingleby is derived from [[Old Norse]] Englar+by and means 'farmstead or village of the English man', Barwick is [[Saxon]] in origin, Bere is Saxon for barley and Wick means farm.<ref>A Dictionary of British Place-Names, A.D. Mills & Adrian Room, Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed 1998</ref> This suggests that the area was affected by both the Viking and Saxon invasions. It may have been that until the 17th century, Ingleby and Barwick were two separate places. After the Norman invasion The Manor of Barwick was given to Robert Malet the son of William Malet, [[William I of England|King William's]] great chamberlain. In the 13th century the land was owned by the Priors of Guisborough & Jervaulx until the [[dissolution of monasteries]]. Between the 14th and 16th centuries landowners included the [[Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland|Percys of Northumberland]] and the Parrs of Nottingham. The Middle Ages are considered to have ended with the Renaissance in the mid 15th century\n\n===Early Modern history===\nIn the 17th century the Manor of Barwick was sold to Sir Thomas Lynch, [[List of Governors of Jamaica|Governor of Jamaica]] and then to Sir William Turner of [[Kirkleatham]]. The land remaining in the ownership of the Turner's, with profits from the land used to support the free school and hospital at Kirkleatham, until it was sold in the 19th century.\n\n===19th century===\nIngleby Barwick is listed as being a township in the parish of Stainton in 1887.<ref>John Bartholomew, Gazetteer of the British Isles (1887)</ref><ref>A Vision of Britain through time.

The post box is located at the end of Apsley Way in The Rings.\n\n=== Original features ===\nThere are still a number of features that pre-date the 1980s-onward development:\n* The route of the original Barwick Lane, which gave access to much of the original farmland remains accessible. Its origin remains as a cul-de-sac, to the east of the Fox Covert Inn on Low Lane. This then becomes a cycle path, whose route can be navigated through Sober Hall, crossing Sober Hall Avenue, Pennine Way and Blair Avenue, passing west of Barley Fields Primary School and the Myton Road shops before crossing Blair Avenue's northern loop and terminating in name at the Myton Way/The Rings roundabout. Galava Walk is the original end of Barwick Lane leading to Barwick Farm being renamed when houses South of the lane were built.\n* Another original road route is preserved in the cycle path that runs in a westerly direction starting from the Teal Arms / Ingleby Barwick Post Office complex, this being the approximate former site of Low Farm. This route continues to the west of Myton Way and merged into Barwick Lane, leading eventually to Barwick Farm.\n* Low Farm. One of the buildings is incorporated in the Teal Arms pub.\n* Black Mill on Raydale Beck is the remnant of a corn mill built on the original Sober Hall Farm, now residential.\n* The Old Mill at the southern end of Barwick Lane is now a bed and breakfast\n* Cleveland View on Barwick Lane is another former farm building, belonging originally to Lane House Farm.\n* There are original buildings from Ingleby Hill Farm at the end of Heddon Grove, now residential.\n* Ingleby Close Farm buildings, which lie on land originally occupied by Betty's Close Farm, now residential, lie between Crosswell Park and Trevine Gardens.\n* The route of the original road to Betty's Close Farm is preserved in the route of the cycle path that runs from Cleveland View to Roundhill Avenue (and whose route continues along the approach to Ingleby Close Farm buildings).\n* The route of the original road to White House Farm is preserved in the line of trees behind Rochester Court and Thirwall Drive, continuing in the east-west cycle path from there to Blair Avenue and in the east-west footpath that runs to the south of Harlech Court.\n* The original Myton House Farm site is marked by the public house that bears its name.

The school opened as All Saints Voluntary Aided Church of England Secondary School,<ref>http://www.allsaintsib.org/</ref> a [[Church of England]] secondary school and initially accommodated 600 pupils. From September 2009 the admission number to year 7 has been increased to 140 pupils.\n\nThe school was built through PFI funding.  The original PFI Provider (Robertson Construction North East) have recently sold the investment on to another company making a reported \u00a31&nbsp;million profit.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} The ''Evening Gazette'' on 22 November 2011 in an article on PFI said \"Stockton Council has one PFI contract, for the Ingleby Barwick Community Campus which features All Saints School, Myton Park Primary School, and a library. The deal is worth \u00a333.9m for the remaining 17 years of the contract. The private contractor Robertson North East says the complex is worth \u00a39m on its website.\"\n\nAll Saints provides places for less than half of the children of secondary school age currently living in Ingleby Barwick, with most of the remainder, some 900, being schooled at [[Conyers' School]] in [[Yarm]], [[Egglescliffe School]] in [[Eaglescliffe]] and [[St Patrick's Catholic College]] in Thornaby.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} In May 2013 All Saints school became an Academy, renaming to \"[[All Saints Academy, Ingleby Barwick|All Saints Academy]]\".\n\n====Ingleby Manor Free School and Sixth Form====\nSince the construction of All Saints' School, a proposal for a second secondary school with a Sixth Form, Ingleby Manor School, was developed by a group of local residents who proposed to open the school as part of the government's \"Free Schools\" programme.\n\nThe School has caused controversy in the local community due to a planning application for the school being tied in with a development of 350 houses on an area of green wedge land at Little Maltby Farm. On Tuesday 5 February 2013 Stockton Borough Council Planning Committee rejected the joint plans for a free school and 350 houses. Despite this the school appointed their Principal Designate, David Willard, on 4 July 2012. The new Principal, Ray Parkinson took over midway through the schools fourth year\n\nThe school was originally proposed to open in September 2013 with permanent buildings ready in September 2014, however this was then put back by 1 year due to the development being refused planning permission. A planning appeal was submitted to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government who, on 27 September 2013, overturned the local decision to refuse planning permission for the Free School and 350 houses.\n\nFurther controversy was caused in the local community after the Free School developers unveiled plans to build an additional 550 homes around the school, bringing the total number to 900 homes on area designated as green wedge land.\n\nIn September 2014 Ingleby Manor School, as a member of the School Partnership Trust Academies, now Delta Academies Trust,  opened with the Year 7 group in temporary premises on Teesside Industrial Estate. Ground works for the new school eventually commenced in August 2015 on the \"Little Maltby Farm\" site on Low Lane. Meanwhile, the school continues to operate in the temporary premises on Teesside Industrial Estate. As at March 2016 the construction of the school buildings is progressing to schedule and a new roundabout on Low Lane to give access to the school and houses nearby is under construction. The school opened in these new premises in September 2016.\n\n==Traffic and social problems==\n\n===Congestion and speeding===\nIngleby Barwick faces a number of problems, including traffic congestion at peak times. These are particularly a concern around Ingleby Barwick centre, and the exit on to Low Lane. Speeding is also a significant problem within the estate. On 15 July 2011, 9-year old Brandon Maggs died after being hit by a car on Roundhill Avenue. This prompted residents to launch a campaign to reduce speeding on the main estate roads.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tees-14238587 Speed petition after child dies in Ingelby Barwick]</ref>\n\nIn 2016, Myton Way was upgraded to dual-carrigeway from the Tesco roundabout to Broom Hill, and the Sandgate roundabout was replaced with traffic signals. Ingleby Way was also dualled from the Tesco roundabout to Barwick Way roundabout. The works started on Monday 29 February 2016 and were completed on Thursday 22 December 2016, apart from some footpath work. <ref>https://www.stockton.gov.uk/majorhighwayprojects</ref>\n\n===Anti-social behaviour===\n[[File:Ingleby Barwick Graffiti Panoramic.jpg|thumb|right|Graffiti on the bridge over the Tees on Queen Elizabeth Way, 2006]]Social problems have long been an issue in Ingleby Barwick, and were mentioned in the 1986 Domesday project.

Ingleby Barwick has a ceremonial [[Coat of Arms]]. The arms contain a representation of the three rivers that run around Ingleby Barwick. It also depicts mill-rinds which are an historical link to the Turner family, who used to own the land which now forms Ingleby Barwick.\nThe crest shows a Teal bird which refers to a horse named Teal, trained at Middleham by Captain Neville Crump, which won the [[Grand National]] in 1952.<ref>Grand National Winners and Results \u2013 1886 to 2010 \u2013 http://www.aintree.co.uk/index.php?content=ainwinners&p=2</ref>\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:crest ingleby barwick.gif|thumb|Ingleby Barwick Coat of Arms {{deletable image-caption|Monday, 7 December 2009}}]] -->\n\n===Early history===\nThere are traces of human occupation from as far back as the [[Stone Age]].

Ingleby is derived from [[Old Norse]] Englar+by and means 'farmstead or village of the English man', Barwick is [[Saxon]] in origin, Bere is Saxon for barley and Wick means farm.<ref>A Dictionary of British Place-Names, A.D. Mills & Adrian Room, Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed 1998</ref> This suggests that the area was affected by both the Viking and Saxon invasions. It may have been that until the 17th century, Ingleby and Barwick were two separate places. After the Norman invasion The Manor of Barwick was given to Robert Malet the son of William Malet, [[William I of England|King William's]] great chamberlain. In the 13th century the land was owned by the Priors of Guisborough & Jervaulx until the [[dissolution of monasteries]]. Between the 14th and 16th centuries landowners included the [[Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland|Percys of Northumberland]] and the Parrs of Nottingham. The Middle Ages are considered to have ended with the Renaissance in the mid 15th century\n\n===Early Modern history===\nIn the 17th century the Manor of Barwick was sold to Sir Thomas Lynch, [[List of Governors of Jamaica|Governor of Jamaica]] and then to Sir William Turner of [[Kirkleatham]]. The land remaining in the ownership of the Turner's, with profits from the land used to support the free school and hospital at Kirkleatham, until it was sold in the 19th century.\n\n===19th century===\nIngleby Barwick is listed as being a township in the parish of Stainton in 1887.<ref>John Bartholomew, Gazetteer of the British Isles (1887)</ref><ref>A Vision of Britain through time.

The post box is located at the end of Apsley Way in The Rings.\n\n=== Original features ===\nThere are still a number of features that pre-date the 1980s-onward development:\n* The route of the original Barwick Lane, which gave access to much of the original farmland remains accessible. Its origin remains as a cul-de-sac, to the east of the Fox Covert Inn on Low Lane. This then becomes a cycle path, whose route can be navigated through Sober Hall, crossing Sober Hall Avenue, Pennine Way and Blair Avenue, passing west of Barley Fields Primary School and the Myton Road shops before crossing Blair Avenue's northern loop and terminating in name at the Myton Way/The Rings roundabout. Galava Walk is the original end of Barwick Lane leading to Barwick Farm being renamed when houses South of the lane were built.\n* Another original road route is preserved in the cycle path that runs in a westerly direction starting from the Teal Arms / Ingleby Barwick Post Office complex, this being the approximate former site of Low Farm. This route continues to the west of Myton Way and merged into Barwick Lane, leading eventually to Barwick Farm.\n* Low Farm. One of the buildings is incorporated in the Teal Arms pub.\n* Black Mill on Raydale Beck is the remnant of a corn mill built on the original Sober Hall Farm, now residential.\n* The Old Mill at the southern end of Barwick Lane is now a bed and breakfast\n* Cleveland View on Barwick Lane is another former farm building, belonging originally to Lane House Farm.\n* There are original buildings from Ingleby Hill Farm at the end of Heddon Grove, now residential.\n* Ingleby Close Farm buildings, which lie on land originally occupied by Betty's Close Farm, now residential, lie between Crosswell Park and Trevine Gardens.\n* The route of the original road to Betty's Close Farm is preserved in the route of the cycle path that runs from Cleveland View to Roundhill Avenue (and whose route continues along the approach to Ingleby Close Farm buildings).\n* The route of the original road to White House Farm is preserved in the line of trees behind Rochester Court and Thirwall Drive, continuing in the east-west cycle path from there to Blair Avenue and in the east-west footpath that runs to the south of Harlech Court.\n* The original Myton House Farm site is marked by the public house that bears its name. The pub's website says \"Formally (sic) a farmhouse...\"\n* Ingleby Hill Farm. \"Impressive early C19, Late Georgian, Grade II Listed Farmhouse.\"\n\n==Administration==\n{{Infobox coat of arms\n|name=Arms of Ingleby Barwick Town Council\n|shield=Or three barrulets wavy Azure over all three Mill-rinds Gules.\n|crest=On a Wreath Or and Gules a Teal proper supporting with the dexter wing a Garb Or.\n|motto=Stepping Stones To The Future\n|notes=Granted in October 2000. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://civicheraldry.co.uk/yorkshire.html#ingleby%20barwick%20tc |title= INGLEBY BARWICK TOWN COUNCIL (NORTH YORKSHIRE - Stockton-on-Tees) |publisher=Robert Young |accessdate=31 October 2019}}</ref>}}\nIngleby Barwick, as part of the Stockton on Tees unitary authority, has six borough councillors representing the two wards Ingleby Barwick East and Ingleby Barwick West.

From September 2009 the admission number to year 7 has been increased to 140 pupils.\n\nThe school was built through PFI funding.  The original PFI Provider (Robertson Construction North East) have recently sold the investment on to another company making a reported \u00a31&nbsp;million profit.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} The ''Evening Gazette'' on 22 November 2011 in an article on PFI said \"Stockton Council has one PFI contract, for the Ingleby Barwick Community Campus which features All Saints School, Myton Park Primary School, and a library.

On Tuesday 5 February 2013 Stockton Borough Council Planning Committee rejected the joint plans for a free school and 350 houses. Despite this the school appointed their Principal Designate, David Willard, on 4 July 2012. The new Principal, Ray Parkinson took over midway through the schools fourth year\n\nThe school was originally proposed to open in September 2013 with permanent buildings ready in September 2014, however this was then put back by 1 year due to the development being refused planning permission. A planning appeal was submitted to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government who, on 27 September 2013, overturned the local decision to refuse planning permission for the Free School and 350 houses.\n\nFurther controversy was caused in the local community after the Free School developers unveiled plans to build an additional 550 homes around the school, bringing the total number to 900 homes on area designated as green wedge land.\n\nIn September 2014 Ingleby Manor School, as a member of the School Partnership Trust Academies, now Delta Academies Trust,  opened with the Year 7 group in temporary premises on Teesside Industrial Estate. Ground works for the new school eventually commenced in August 2015 on the \"Little Maltby Farm\" site on Low Lane. Meanwhile, the school continues to operate in the temporary premises on Teesside Industrial Estate. As at March 2016 the construction of the school buildings is progressing to schedule and a new roundabout on Low Lane to give access to the school and houses nearby is under construction. The school opened in these new premises in September 2016.\n\n==Traffic and social problems==\n\n===Congestion and speeding===\nIngleby Barwick faces a number of problems, including traffic congestion at peak times. These are particularly a concern around Ingleby Barwick centre, and the exit on to Low Lane. Speeding is also a significant problem within the estate. On 15 July 2011, 9-year old Brandon Maggs died after being hit by a car on Roundhill Avenue. This prompted residents to launch a campaign to reduce speeding on the main estate roads.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tees-14238587 Speed petition after child dies in Ingelby Barwick]</ref>\n\nIn 2016, Myton Way was upgraded to dual-carrigeway from the Tesco roundabout to Broom Hill, and the Sandgate roundabout was replaced with traffic signals. Ingleby Way was also dualled from the Tesco roundabout to Barwick Way roundabout. The works started on Monday 29 February 2016 and were completed on Thursday 22 December 2016, apart from some footpath work. <ref>https://www.stockton.gov.uk/majorhighwayprojects</ref>\n\n===Anti-social behaviour===\n[[File:Ingleby Barwick Graffiti Panoramic.jpg|thumb|right|Graffiti on the bridge over the Tees on Queen Elizabeth Way, 2006]]Social problems have long been an issue in Ingleby Barwick, and were mentioned in the 1986 Domesday project.

Since Willingham's 2004 [[Capital punishment|execution]], significant controversy has arisen over the interpretation of the evidence that was used to convict him of arson and murder.\n\nWillingham's case and the investigative techniques were criticized by a 2004 ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' article. The case was discussed again in a 2009 investigative report in ''[[The New Yorker]]''.<ref name=Grann/> This coverage suggested that the arson evidence was misinterpreted.  According to an August 2009 investigative report by an expert hired by the [[Texas Forensic Science Commission]], the original claims of arson were doubtful.<ref name=\"Beyler\"/> The Corsicana Fire Department disputes the findings, stating that the report overlooked several key points in the record.<ref name=\"CityReport2009\">{{cite news |last1=Jacobs |first1=Janet |title=City report on arson probe |url=http://corsicanadailysun.com/thewillinghamfiles/x546110540/-10-04-09-City-report-on-arson-probe?keyword=secondarystory |accessdate=July 20, 2018 |work=[[Corsicana Daily Sun]] |date=October 4, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311164734/http://corsicanadailysun.com/thewillinghamfiles/x546110540/-10-04-09-City-report-on-arson-probe?keyword=secondarystory |archivedate=March 11, 2012}}</ref> The 2011 documentary ''[[Incendiary: The Willingham Case]]'' also explored the case.\n\nThe case was complicated by allegations that [[Texas Governor]] [[Rick Perry]] impeded the investigation by replacing three of the nine Forensic Commission members in an attempt to change the commission's findings; Perry denies the allegations.<ref name=CNN20091002>{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Matt|title=Shake-up in Texas execution probe draws criticism, questions|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/10/01/texas.execution.probe/index.html|accessdate=March 29, 2014|newspaper=[[CNN]]|date=October 2, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Fire==\nOn December 23, 1991, a fire destroyed the family home of Cameron Todd Willingham in [[Corsicana, Texas]]. Killed in the fire were Willingham's three daughters: two-year-old Amber Louise Kuykendall and one-year-old twins Karmon Diane Willingham and Kameron Marie Willingham. Willingham escaped the home with only minor burns. Stacy Kuykendall, Willingham's then-wife and the mother of his three daughters, was not home at the time of the fire. She was out shopping for Christmas presents at the Salvation Army.\n\nProsecutors charged that Willingham set the fire and killed the children in an attempt to cover up the abuse of the girls.<ref name=ClarkCountyProsecutor>{{cite web|title=Cameron Todd Willingham|url=http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/willingham899.htm|publisher=The Clark County Prosecuting Attorney|accessdate=March 29, 2014}}</ref> However, there was no evidence of child abuse. Kuykendall told prosecutors that he had never abused the children. \"Our kids were spoiled rotten\", she said, insisting he would never harm their children.<ref name=Grann/>\n\n==Investigation and trial==\n===Evidence===\nAfter the fire, the police investigation determined that the fire had been started using some form of a liquid accelerant. This evidence included a finding of char patterns in the floor in the shape of \"puddles\", a finding of multiple starting points of the fire, and a finding that the fire had burned \"fast and hot\", all considered to indicate a fire that had been ignited with the help of a liquid accelerant. The investigators also found charring under the aluminum front doorjamb, which they believed was a further indication of a liquid accelerant and tested positive for such an accelerant in the area of the front door. No clear motive was found, and Willingham's wife denied that the couple had been fighting prior to the night of the fire.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n===Witnesses===\n====Johnny Webb====\nIn addition to the arson evidence presented at the trial, a [[jailhouse informant]] named Johnny Webb testified at that time. His testimony has been criticized as contentious for several reasons. Webb claimed that Willingham confessed that he set the fire to hide an injury or death of one of the girls, which was caused by his wife.<ref name=\"Webb testimony\"/> But none of the girls were found at the time of death to have physical injuries that were still distinguishable after the effects of the fire.<ref name=\"chicagotribune\">{{cite news|title = Man executed on disproved forensics|first=Steve|last=Mills|first2=Maurice|last2=Possley|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0412090169dec09,0,1173806.story|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=December 9, 2004|accessdate=September 1, 2009 }}</ref> Webb later told David Grann, a reporter for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' that he might have been mistaken. He said he was prescribed many medications at that point while being treated for [[bipolar disorder]].<ref name=Grann/>\n\nAt Willingham's trial, Webb offered an explanation for the individual, distinguishable burns found on Amber's forehead and arm. He said that Willingham confessed to burning her twice with a piece of \"wadded up\" paper in an effort to make it appear as though the children were \"playing with fire\".<ref name=\"Webb testimony\">{{cite web|title=Testimony of Johnny Webb on the first day of the trial|url=http://www.innocenceproject.org/docs/Willingham_Transcript/Willinghamv11.pdf|publisher=[[Innocence Project]]|accessdate=April 18, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928040758/http://www.innocenceproject.org/docs/Willingham_Transcript/Willinghamv11.pdf|archivedate=September 28, 2011|format=PDF|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nProsecutor John Jackson noted that Webb was considered unreliable, but he later supported an early release from prison for Webb. Webb later sent Jackson a \"Motion to Recant Testimony\", which declared, \"Mr. Willingham is innocent of all charges.\" Willingham's attorneys were not notified. Webb later recanted his recantation. Webb later said, \"The statute of limitations has run out on [[perjury]], hasn't it?\"<ref name=\"Grann\"/>\n\nWebb and Jackson consistently denied that Webb was offered a sentence reduction in return for his testimony against Willingham. Evidence of such a deal would have eliminated Webb's testimony. In February 2014, the ''New York Times'' reported that the [[Innocence Project]] investigators said that they had discovered a handwritten note in Webb's files indicating that just such a deal was in play.<ref>{{cite news|last=Schwartz|first=John|title=Evidence of Concealed Jailhouse Deal Raises Questions About a Texas Execution|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/28/us/evidence-of-concealed-jailhouse-deal-raises-questions-about-a-texas-execution.html?_r=1|accessdate=March 29, 2014|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 27, 2014}}</ref>\n\n====James Grigson====\nDuring the penalty phase of the trial, a prosecutor said that Willingham's tattoo of a skull and serpent fit the profile of a sociopath. Two medical experts confirmed the theory. A psychologist was asked to interpret Willingham's [[Iron Maiden]] poster. He said that a picture of a fist punching through a skull signified violence and death. He added that Willingham's [[Led Zeppelin]] poster of a fallen angel was \"many times\" an indicator of \"cultive-type\" activities.<ref name=Grann/>\n\nPsychiatrist [[James Grigson]], known by the moniker \"Dr. Death\" for his repeated testimony as an expert witness in which he recommended the death penalty, said that a man of Willingham's criminal history was an \"extremely severe sociopath\" and was incurable.<ref name=Grann/> Grigson had served as an expert witness for the prosecution in murder trials across the state of Texas. Prior to his death, he was expelled by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] and the Texas Society of Psychiatric Physicians for unethical conduct.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Tolson |first1=Mike |title=Effect of \"Dr. Death\" and his testimony lingers |url=https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Effect-of-Dr-Death-and-his-testimony-lingers-1960299.php |accessdate=July 21, 2018 |work=Houston Chronicle |date=June 17, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Herskovitz |first1=Jon |title=Texas appeals court halts execution of man who did not kill anyone |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-texas-execution-idUSKCN10U2D6 |accessdate=July 21, 2018 |work=[[Reuters]] |date=August 20, 2016}}</ref> The APA said that Grigson had violated the organization's ethics code by\n\n<blockquote>arriving at a psychiatric diagnosis without first having examined the individuals in question, and for indicating, while testifying in court as an expert witness, that he could predict with 100 per cent certainty that the individuals would engage in future violent acts.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.ccadp.org/DrDeath.htm | title = Groups Expel Psychiatrist Known for Murder Cases; Witness nicknamed 'Dr. Death' says license won't be affected by allegations | publisher = [[Dallas Morning News]] | date = July 26, 1995 | first = Laura | last = Bell | accessdate = March 21, 2009 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090307034749/http://ccadp.org/DrDeath.htm | archivedate = March 7, 2009 | df = mdy-all }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe prosecution sought to establish that Willingham's conduct at the time of the fire and in the days afterward was suspicious. As the fire took hold, Willingham was driven out through the front door of his house, where he crouched down near the entrance. On seeing neighbor Diane Barbee, Willingham began to shout at her to call 911, shouting \"My babies are in there!\"<ref name=\"Fogg statement\"/> At trial, Willingham's conduct at the scene was described as oscillating between collected and hysterical \u2014 at times screaming for assistance and at other times calmly pushing his car back from the flames that were engulfing his house. Willingham later explained that he removed the car out of concern that it could explode and worsen the house fire.<ref name=Grann/>\n\n====Witnesses to the event and days after====\nEyewitnesses described Willingham as having \"singed hair on his chest, eyelids, and head and had a two-inch burn injury on his right shoulder, but the prosecution highlighted the absence of any evidence of smoke inhalation. His wrists and hands were blackened with smoke. He was eventually transported to the hospital for treatment, in handcuffs.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alt.coxnewsweb.com/shared-blogs/austin/investigative/upload/2009/08/execution_based_on_bad_investi/D_Beyler%20FINAL%20REPORT%20082509.pdf |format=PDF |title=Analysis of the Fire Investigation Methods and Procedures Used in the Criminal Arson Cases Against Ernest Ray Willis and Cameron Todd Willingham |author=Craig L.

According to Brandice Barbee, \"All I could see was smoke\".<ref name=\"Fogg statement\"/> According to Brandice, he refused, and moved his car away from the fire before returning to sit on a nearby lawn, \"not once attempting to go inside to rescue his children\". Once the fire had reached [[flashover]] and the fire department arrived, Willingham became far more agitated, to the point of being restrained by emergency services.\n\nIn the following days, Willingham returned to the house with some family and friends. Neighbors described this group as having an odd levity, which was seen to turn somber on the arrival of authorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.innocenceproject.org/docs/Willingham_Transcript/Willinghamv12.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 21, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928040823/http://www.innocenceproject.org/docs/Willingham_Transcript/Willinghamv12.pdf |archivedate=September 28, 2011 }}</ref> On returning to the scene of the fire with fireman Ron Franks, in an effort to recover personal property (which was described as a very usual request at trial), Willingham was visibly dismayed at being unable to find a dart set.

He wrote, \"Willingham's wife insisted during the trial and under interrogation that Willingham had not physically abused the children.\"<ref name=\"Grannresponds\"/> The testimony at trial of Johnny Webb, a jailhouse informant, suggested that Willingham had set the fire in order to cover up an injury or death of one of the children due to his wife's actions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.innocenceproject.org/docs/Willingham_Transcript/Willinghamv11.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 26, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928040758/http://www.innocenceproject.org/docs/Willingham_Transcript/Willinghamv11.pdf |archivedate=September 28, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe prosecutor also claimed that Willingham was a serial [[domestic violence|wife abuser]], both physically and emotionally. Jackson claimed Willingham had abused animals and was a [[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]].<ref name=\"jackson\"/> However, those not associated with the case paint a different picture of Willingham. His former probation officer, Polly Goodin, said he had never demonstrated bizarre or sociopathic behavior and that \"He was probably one of my favorite kids.\"<ref name=Grann/> Bebe Bridges, a former judge who was often on the \"opposite side\" of Willingham in the legal system, and who had sent him to jail for stealing, said that she could not imagine him killing his children. \"He was polite, and he seemed to care,\" she said.<ref name=Grann/>\n\n===Trial===\nWillingham was charged with murder on January 8, 1992.<ref>{{cite news |title=A timeline of the Cameron Todd Willingham case |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-06-25/news/ct-met-perry-execution-2-20110625_1_fire-investigation-willingham-home-texas-forensic-science-commission |accessdate=July 21, 2018 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=June 25, 2011}}</ref> During his trial in August 1992, he was offered a life term in exchange for a guilty plea, which he turned down, insisting he was innocent.<ref name=Grann/><ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Amnesty International]]|title=Document \u2013 USA (Texas): Further Information on Death penalty, Cameron Todd Willingham|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/amr51/182/2004/en/|date=December 13, 2004 |accessdate=September 1, 2009}}</ref>\n\nAt trial, the fire investigator Vasquez testified there were three points of origin for the fire, which indicated that the fire was \"intentionally set by human hands\".<ref name=Grann/> A sample of burned material near the doorway of the house tested positive for mineral spirits, indicating the presence of lighter fluid.

Jimmie Hensley, a police detective, and Douglas Fogg, the assistant fire chief \u2014 who both investigated the fire \u2014 told ''The New Yorker'' author Grann that they had never believed that the fridge was part of the arson plot. \"It didn't have [anything] to do with the fire\", Fogg said.<ref name=Grann/>\n\nJackson contradicted Willingham's account by claiming blood gas analysis at Navarro Regional Hospital shortly after the fire revealed that Willingham had not inhaled any smoke.

He insisted he would not admit to something he had not done, even if it meant sparing his life.

According to an August 2009 investigative report by an expert hired by the [[Texas Forensic Science Commission]], the original claims of arson were doubtful.<ref name=\"Beyler\"/> The Corsicana Fire Department disputes the findings, stating that the report overlooked several key points in the record.<ref name=\"CityReport2009\">{{cite news |last1=Jacobs |first1=Janet |title=City report on arson probe |url=http://corsicanadailysun.com/thewillinghamfiles/x546110540/-10-04-09-City-report-on-arson-probe?keyword=secondarystory |accessdate=July 20, 2018 |work=[[Corsicana Daily Sun]] |date=October 4, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311164734/http://corsicanadailysun.com/thewillinghamfiles/x546110540/-10-04-09-City-report-on-arson-probe?keyword=secondarystory |archivedate=March 11, 2012}}</ref> The 2011 documentary ''[[Incendiary: The Willingham Case]]'' also explored the case.\n\nThe case was complicated by allegations that [[Texas Governor]] [[Rick Perry]] impeded the investigation by replacing three of the nine Forensic Commission members in an attempt to change the commission's findings; Perry denies the allegations.<ref name=CNN20091002>{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Matt|title=Shake-up in Texas execution probe draws criticism, questions|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/10/01/texas.execution.probe/index.html|accessdate=March 29, 2014|newspaper=[[CNN]]|date=October 2, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Fire==\nOn December 23, 1991, a fire destroyed the family home of Cameron Todd Willingham in [[Corsicana, Texas]]. Killed in the fire were Willingham's three daughters: two-year-old Amber Louise Kuykendall and one-year-old twins Karmon Diane Willingham and Kameron Marie Willingham. Willingham escaped the home with only minor burns. Stacy Kuykendall, Willingham's then-wife and the mother of his three daughters, was not home at the time of the fire. She was out shopping for Christmas presents at the Salvation Army.\n\nProsecutors charged that Willingham set the fire and killed the children in an attempt to cover up the abuse of the girls.<ref name=ClarkCountyProsecutor>{{cite web|title=Cameron Todd Willingham|url=http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/willingham899.htm|publisher=The Clark County Prosecuting Attorney|accessdate=March 29, 2014}}</ref> However, there was no evidence of child abuse. Kuykendall told prosecutors that he had never abused the children. \"Our kids were spoiled rotten\", she said, insisting he would never harm their children.<ref name=Grann/>\n\n==Investigation and trial==\n===Evidence===\nAfter the fire, the police investigation determined that the fire had been started using some form of a liquid accelerant. This evidence included a finding of char patterns in the floor in the shape of \"puddles\", a finding of multiple starting points of the fire, and a finding that the fire had burned \"fast and hot\", all considered to indicate a fire that had been ignited with the help of a liquid accelerant. The investigators also found charring under the aluminum front doorjamb, which they believed was a further indication of a liquid accelerant and tested positive for such an accelerant in the area of the front door. No clear motive was found, and Willingham's wife denied that the couple had been fighting prior to the night of the fire.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n===Witnesses===\n====Johnny Webb====\nIn addition to the arson evidence presented at the trial, a [[jailhouse informant]] named Johnny Webb testified at that time. His testimony has been criticized as contentious for several reasons.

Webb later sent Jackson a \"Motion to Recant Testimony\", which declared, \"Mr. Willingham is innocent of all charges.\" Willingham's attorneys were not notified. Webb later recanted his recantation. Webb later said, \"The statute of limitations has run out on [[perjury]], hasn't it?\"<ref name=\"Grann\"/>\n\nWebb and Jackson consistently denied that Webb was offered a sentence reduction in return for his testimony against Willingham.

Once the fire had reached [[flashover]] and the fire department arrived, Willingham became far more agitated, to the point of being restrained by emergency services.\n\nIn the following days, Willingham returned to the house with some family and friends.
