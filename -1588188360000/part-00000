Hec is remote, but Bella quickly manages to break through Ricky's defensive shell by taking him hunting and giving him a dog for his 13th birthday, which he names Tupac after his idol [[Tupac Shakur]].\n\nWhen Bella suddenly dies and Hec tells Ricky that child services will take him back, Ricky ineptly fakes his [[suicide]] by burning a barn and runs away into the bush with Tupac, where he is completely unable to cope and gets lost.  Hec finds him easily but breaks his ankle in a fall, forcing the two to camp for a period of time.  The authorities meanwhile have found the house empty and the barn burnt down, and come to the conclusion that the bereaved and mentally unstable Hec has abducted Ricky.  The impression is strengthened after an encounter with three foolish hunters who get the idea that Hec is molesting Ricky.  Hec reveals to Ricky that he has served prison time for manslaughter and is illiterate.  Ricky, in turn, says his only friend in foster care has died and that his only options are risking the same fate in the foster system, or serve time in juvenile prison.  The pair agree to disappear into the bush.\n\nA national manhunt ensues, and the two slowly bond while working together to escape arrest. Upon finding another hut, they encounter an unconscious, diabetic ranger. Ricky leaves to find help and runs into a girl his age named Kahu. She takes him back to her house and introduces him to her dad. Ricky stays the night and returns the next morning to the hut where Hec was supposed to be. Ricky finds the place to be swarming with police, led by Paula. Ricky runs away. He later encounters Paula and Andy in the bush, separated by a [[ravine]]. Paula attempts to bribe Ricky, asking him to say that Hec was a sex offender. In return, she tells him that he will not ever go to juvenile prison. Ricky declines and runs away. Ricky catches up to Hec by remembering the survival strategies Hec taught him, and they continue their travels. They encounter a wild boar that mortally wounds Hec's dog Zag, forcing Hec to euthanize him. Ricky reveals he has been carrying Bella's ashes and originally planned to deliver them to \"where the earth wets the cloak of the sky,\" as per her wishes. They bury Zag and scatter Bella's ashes into a remote waterfall high in a mountain range. Ricky and Hec find a man living out on his own called Psycho Sam. Sam lets them stay the night. After five months of surviving in the wilderness and several close calls, they are finally caught following a car and helicopter chase, and Ricky accidentally shoots Hec.  Hec gets remanded and Ricky is taken in by Kahu's family.\n\nAfter Hec's release from jail, Ricky, with his new foster family's permission, returns to the bush with Hec to photograph the [[huia]], an extinct bird they had re-discovered during their time on the run.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Sam Neill]] as Hector Faulkner\n* [[Julian Dennison]] as Ricky Baker\n* [[Rima Te Wiata]] as Bella Faulkner\n* [[Rachel House (actress)|Rachel House]] as Paula Hall, a child welfare worker\n* [[Rhys Darby]] as Psycho Sam\n* [[Oscar Kightley]] as Andy, a police officer\n* [[Stan Walker]] as Ron\n* Tioreore Ngatai-Melbourne as Kahu\n* Troy Kingi as TK\n* Cohen Holloway as Hugh\n* [[Taika Waititi]] as the Minister\n\n== Production ==\nWaititi first began to adapt the book ''Wild Pork and Watercress'' in 2005, and completed multiple different drafts.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/features/703677-taika-waititi-wilderpeople-ragnarok#/slide/1|title=Taika Waititi Talks Wilderpeople and Ragnarok|date=2016-07-19|newspaper=ComingSoon.net|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-03}}</ref> The early drafts stayed true to the book.

The 3DO code was then [[Porting|ported]] to PC as ''The Ur-Quan Masters''. A sequel, ''[[Star Control 3]]'', was released in 1996.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:StarControl2 Entering Sol System.png|thumb|left|The Captain's ship enters the [[Sol System]] at the beginning of the game. (In The Ur-Quan Masters.)]]\n[[File:StarControlII Screenshot.png|thumb|left|Discussion with various characters is an important aspect in the game. Here the player is speaking with Commander Hayes at the Earth starbase.]]\n''Star Control II'' added a large number of [[species]] and ship types to the already diverse cast and replaced the first game's strategy-based scenarios with a story-driven space exploration [[adventure game]] that included diplomacy with the inhabitants of the galaxy, some [[resource gathering]] sub-sections, and instances of the space combat of the first game whenever diplomacy fails.\n\nAs typical of the adventure game genre, the player must explore the game world with little direction and make discoveries and connections independently. Interaction with the various alien species is a chief part of the adventure game; the backstory of both the species from the first games and new ones were fleshed out considerably. There are hours of dialogue, each species bringing out their characteristic conversational quirks, music, and even display fonts.\n\nA two-player mode is available, named Super Melee, consisting solely of the ship-to-ship combat. All ships from the first game are available, even if they made no appearance in the story, along with a number of new ones.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the last phase of the war between the Alliance of Free Stars and the Hierarchy of Battle Thralls, an Earthling ship discovered an ancient [[Precursor (Star Control)|Precursor]] subterranean installation in the Vela star system. A massive Hierarchy offensive forced the Alliance fleets to retreat beyond Vela, stranding the science expedition, who went in to hiding. Decades later, with the help of a genius child born on the planet, the colonists activated the Precursor machinery and found out that it was programmed to build a highly advanced but unfinished starship, which could be piloted only by the now grown genius child, who alone could interact with the Precursor central computer. The new ship set out to Sol to make contact with Earth, but shortly before reaching Sol the little fleet was attacked by an unknown probe; The expedition commander, captaining the expedition's Earthling Cruiser, intercepted the alien ship before it could damage the defenseless Precursor starship, but was killed in the short fight, leaving the genius young man in command.<ref>Star Control II Manual, available at [http://www.abandonia.com/files/extras/Star%20Control%202_Manual.zip Abandonia].</ref>\n\nThe player begins the game as the commander of the Precursor starship, who returns to Earth to find it enslaved by the Ur-Quan. The Captain gains the support of the skeleton crew of Earth's caretaker starbase and ventures out to contact the other races to find out what's happened since the end of the war and try to recruit allies in to a New Alliance of Free Stars against the Ur-Quan. The Captain quickly discovers that the rest of the humans' allies in the war against the Ur-Quan have either been eradicated, put under slave shields, or put into service as Ur-Quan battle thralls. As the player progresses, it is revealed that the Ur-Quan are fighting an [[internecine war]] with the Kohr-Ah, a subspecies of Ur-Quan who believe in eradicating all life in the galaxy, as opposed to enslaving it. The winner of this war will gain access to the Sa-Matra, a Precursor battle platform of unparalleled power. The player must take advantage of the Ur-Quans' distraction to contact and recruit alien races into a new alliance, gather resources and build a fleet, and find a way to destroy the invincible Sa-Matra, before the Ur-Quan finish their war and become unstoppable.\n\nThe Captain resolves issues several of the races are facing, or exploits their weaknesses, to get them on side. Notably the Captain finds the Chenjesu and Mmrnmhrm on Procyon undergoing their own plan to merge in to a composite species powerful enough to defeat the Ur-Quan, and captures a psychic alien Dnyarri, which the Captain discovers is a member of the race that brutally enslaved the galaxy millennia ago, causing the Ur-Quan's hegemonic and genocidal rampage around the galaxy. The Captain uses a precursor Sun Device to accelerate the merging of the Chenjesu and Mmrnmhrm to create the Chmmr, who amplify a precursor terraforming bomb, allowing the Captain to sacrifice his ship to destroy the Sa-Matra and defeat the Ur-Quan.\n\n==Development==\n''Star Control II'' began as a more ambitious project than the original Star Control, with Reiche and Ford hoping to go beyond ship combat to develop a \"science fiction adventure role-playing game\".<ref name=\"Barton2016\"/> The game was highly influenced, both in story and game design, by the games ''[[Starflight]]'' (1986) and ''[[Starflight 2: Trade Routes of the Cloud Nebula]]'' (1989), developed by Binary Systems and released on a variety of platforms by [[Electronic Arts]]. Indeed, Greg Johnson, StarFlight's lead designer, helped write dialog for ''Star Control II'' and Paul Reiche III contributed to the earlier game's alien communication system. [[David Brin]]'s science fiction series about the [[Uplift Universe]] is also often mentioned as inspiration for the ''Star Control II'' universe, as well as [[Larry Niven]]'s [[Known Space]] universe.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe story for Star Control II expands on the characters first created in the original Star Control.<ref name=\"Barton2016\">{{cite book|author=Matt Barton|title=Honoring the Code: Conversations with Great Game Designers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UV7OBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA203|date=19 April 2016|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4665-6754-2|pages=203\u2013}}</ref> Paul Reiche III describes this creative process, \"I know it probably sounds weird, but when I design a game like this, I make drawings of the characters and stare at them.

(In The Ur-Quan Masters.)]]\n[[File:StarControlII Screenshot.png|thumb|left|Discussion with various characters is an important aspect in the game. Here the player is speaking with Commander Hayes at the Earth starbase.]]\n''Star Control II'' added a large number of [[species]] and ship types to the already diverse cast and replaced the first game's strategy-based scenarios with a story-driven space exploration [[adventure game]] that included diplomacy with the inhabitants of the galaxy, some [[resource gathering]] sub-sections, and instances of the space combat of the first game whenever diplomacy fails.\n\nAs typical of the adventure game genre, the player must explore the game world with little direction and make discoveries and connections independently. Interaction with the various alien species is a chief part of the adventure game; the backstory of both the species from the first games and new ones were fleshed out considerably. There are hours of dialogue, each species bringing out their characteristic conversational quirks, music, and even display fonts.\n\nA two-player mode is available, named Super Melee, consisting solely of the ship-to-ship combat. All ships from the first game are available, even if they made no appearance in the story, along with a number of new ones.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the last phase of the war between the Alliance of Free Stars and the Hierarchy of Battle Thralls, an Earthling ship discovered an ancient [[Precursor (Star Control)|Precursor]] subterranean installation in the Vela star system. A massive Hierarchy offensive forced the Alliance fleets to retreat beyond Vela, stranding the science expedition, who went in to hiding. Decades later, with the help of a genius child born on the planet, the colonists activated the Precursor machinery and found out that it was programmed to build a highly advanced but unfinished starship, which could be piloted only by the now grown genius child, who alone could interact with the Precursor central computer. The new ship set out to Sol to make contact with Earth, but shortly before reaching Sol the little fleet was attacked by an unknown probe; The expedition commander, captaining the expedition's Earthling Cruiser, intercepted the alien ship before it could damage the defenseless Precursor starship, but was killed in the short fight, leaving the genius young man in command.<ref>Star Control II Manual, available at [http://www.abandonia.com/files/extras/Star%20Control%202_Manual.zip Abandonia].</ref>\n\nThe player begins the game as the commander of the Precursor starship, who returns to Earth to find it enslaved by the Ur-Quan. The Captain gains the support of the skeleton crew of Earth's caretaker starbase and ventures out to contact the other races to find out what's happened since the end of the war and try to recruit allies in to a New Alliance of Free Stars against the Ur-Quan. The Captain quickly discovers that the rest of the humans' allies in the war against the Ur-Quan have either been eradicated, put under slave shields, or put into service as Ur-Quan battle thralls. As the player progresses, it is revealed that the Ur-Quan are fighting an [[internecine war]] with the Kohr-Ah, a subspecies of Ur-Quan who believe in eradicating all life in the galaxy, as opposed to enslaving it. The winner of this war will gain access to the Sa-Matra, a Precursor battle platform of unparalleled power. The player must take advantage of the Ur-Quans' distraction to contact and recruit alien races into a new alliance, gather resources and build a fleet, and find a way to destroy the invincible Sa-Matra, before the Ur-Quan finish their war and become unstoppable.\n\nThe Captain resolves issues several of the races are facing, or exploits their weaknesses, to get them on side. Notably the Captain finds the Chenjesu and Mmrnmhrm on Procyon undergoing their own plan to merge in to a composite species powerful enough to defeat the Ur-Quan, and captures a psychic alien Dnyarri, which the Captain discovers is a member of the race that brutally enslaved the galaxy millennia ago, causing the Ur-Quan's hegemonic and genocidal rampage around the galaxy. The Captain uses a precursor Sun Device to accelerate the merging of the Chenjesu and Mmrnmhrm to create the Chmmr, who amplify a precursor terraforming bomb, allowing the Captain to sacrifice his ship to destroy the Sa-Matra and defeat the Ur-Quan.\n\n==Development==\n''Star Control II'' began as a more ambitious project than the original Star Control, with Reiche and Ford hoping to go beyond ship combat to develop a \"science fiction adventure role-playing game\".<ref name=\"Barton2016\"/> The game was highly influenced, both in story and game design, by the games ''[[Starflight]]'' (1986) and ''[[Starflight 2: Trade Routes of the Cloud Nebula]]'' (1989), developed by Binary Systems and released on a variety of platforms by [[Electronic Arts]]. Indeed, Greg Johnson, StarFlight's lead designer, helped write dialog for ''Star Control II'' and Paul Reiche III contributed to the earlier game's alien communication system. [[David Brin]]'s science fiction series about the [[Uplift Universe]] is also often mentioned as inspiration for the ''Star Control II'' universe, as well as [[Larry Niven]]'s [[Known Space]] universe.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe story for Star Control II expands on the characters first created in the original Star Control.<ref name=\"Barton2016\">{{cite book|author=Matt Barton|title=Honoring the Code: Conversations with Great Game Designers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UV7OBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA203|date=19 April 2016|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4665-6754-2|pages=203\u2013}}</ref> Paul Reiche III describes this creative process, \"I know it probably sounds weird, but when I design a game like this, I make drawings of the characters and stare at them.

For nuclear armed states joining the treaty, it provides for a time-bound framework for negotiations leading to the verified and irreversible elimination of its nuclear weapons programme.\n\nA mandate adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 23 December 2016 scheduled two sessions for negotiations:  27 to 31 March and from 15 June to 7 July, 2017.<ref>[http://www.icanw.org/campaign-news/un-general-assembly-approves-historic-resolution/ UN General Assembly approves historic resolution], ICAN, 23 December 2016</ref> The treaty passed on schedule on 7 July with 122 in favour, 1 against ([[Netherlands]]), and 1 official abstention ([[Singapore]]). 69 nations did not vote, among them all of the [[List of states with nuclear weapons|nuclear weapon states]] and all [[Member states of NATO|NATO members]] except the Netherlands.<ref name=UNTextAndVote>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/disarmament/ptnw/index.html|title=United Nations Conference to Negotiate a Legally Binding Instrument to Prohibit Nuclear Weapons, Leading Towards their Total Elimination, 27 April to 22 May 2016 |website=www.un.org|language=EN|accessdate=7 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Concept ==\nThe nuclear-weapon-ban treaty, according to its proponents, will constitute an \"unambiguous political commitment\" to achieve and maintain a nuclear-weapon-free world.<ref>[http://www.reachingcriticalwill.org/images/documents/Disarmament-fora/OEWG/2016/Documents/WP34.pdf Working paper 34] submitted to the UN open-ended working group on nuclear disarmament, Geneva, 11 May 2016</ref> However, unlike a comprehensive [[nuclear weapons convention]], it was not intended to contain all of the legal and technical measures required to reach the point of elimination.

Meanwhile Russia is busy drinking vodka and Nuking children.\n\n== Overview of provisions ==\nThe ''preamble'' of the treaty<ref name=finalDraft /> explains the motivation by the \"catastrophic consequences\" of a use of nuclear weapons, by the risk of their sheer existence, by the suffering of the ''[[hibakusha]]'' (the surviving victims of the 1945 [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]) and the victims of nuclear tests, by \"the slow pace of nuclear disarmament\" and by \"the continued reliance on nuclear weapons in military and security concepts\" like [[Nuclear deterrence|deterrence]]. It recognizes \"the disproportionate impact of nuclear-weapon activities on indigenous peoples\". It expresses compliance with existing law: the [[UN charter]], [[international humanitarian law]], [[international human rights law]], the very first UN resolution adopted on 24 January 1946, the NPT, the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty]] and its verification regime, as well as [[nuclear-weapon-free zone]]s. Furthermore, the \"inalienable right\" of peaceful use of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] is emphasized. Finally, social factors for peace and disarmament are recognized: [[Women's rights|participation of both women and men]], education, public conscience, \"international and regional organizations, non-governmental organizations, religious leaders, parliamentarians, academics and the ''hibakusha''\".\n\n''Article 1'' contains prohibitions against the development, testing, production, [[military reserve|stockpiling]], stationing, transfer, use and [[threat]] of use of nuclear weapons, as well as against assistance and encouragement to the prohibited activities. Finally, any direct or indirect \"control over nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices\" is forbidden.\n\n''Article 2'' requires each party to declare whether it had nuclear weapons of their own or deployed on its territory, including the elimination or conversion of related facilities.\n\n''Article 3'' requires parties that do not possess nuclear weapons to maintain their existing IAEA safeguards and, if they have not already done so, to accept safeguards based on the model for non-nuclear-weapon states under the NPT.\n\n''Article 4'' sets out general procedures for negotiations with an individual nuclear armed state becoming party to the treaty, including time limits and responsibilities. If that state has eliminated its nuclear weapons before becoming a party to the treaty, an unspecified \"competent international authority\" will verify that elimination, and the state must also conclude a safeguards agreement with the IAEA to provide credible assurance that it has not diverted nuclear material and has no undeclared nuclear material or activities. If that state has not yet destroyed its arsenal, it must negotiate with that \"competent international authority\" a time-bound plan for the verified and irreversible elimination of its nuclear weapons programme, which will submit it to the next meeting of signing states or to the next review conference, whichever comes first.\n\n''Article 5'' is about national implementation. ''Article 6'' obliges to environmental remediation and to assistance for the victims of the use and testing of nuclear weapons. According to ''Article 7'', states should assist each other to these purposes, with special responsibility of the nuclear powers. More generally, all state parties shall cooperate to facilitate the implementation of the treaty. ''Article 8'' fixes meetings of states parties, the costs of which are shared by the states according to the UN scale of assessment (''Article 9''). ''Articles 10\u201312'' are about the possibility of amendments, the settlement of disputes and the \"goal of universal adherence of all States to the Treaty\".\n\nAccording to ''Articles 13\u201315'', the treaty was open for signature from 20 September 2017 at the UN headquarters in New York. The \"Treaty shall enter into force 90 days after the fiftieth instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession\".\n\n== History, intentions and impact ==\n\n=== Preparations, 2010\u20132016 ===\n[[File:UN working group on nuclear disarmament, May 2016.jpg|thumb|right|Nations debate the idea of a nuclear-weapon-ban treaty at the UN in Geneva in May 2016.]]\nProposals for a nuclear-weapon-ban treaty first emerged following a review conference of the NPT in 2010, at which the five officially recognized nuclear-armed state parties \u2013 the United States, Russia, Britain, France and China \u2013 rejected calls for the start of negotiations on a comprehensive [[Nuclear weapons convention]].

The request of a nuclear ban could only weaken the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), regarding that the nuclear forces were blocking multi-lateral disarmament negotiations since 1995, instead were planning modernization and rearmament. Therefore, they would abdicate from their responsibility of disarmament according to the NPT, Article VI. Then the danger would grow that in reaction other nations felt less stronger bound to non-proliferation. By contrast, the nuclear weapon ban treaty would aim at a new disarmament dynamics, hence would much more recover than weaken the NPT.<ref>Xanthe Hall, [http://www.fr.de/politik/meinung/gastbeitraege/verbot-von-atomwaffen-berlin-boykottiert-atomwaffen-konferenz-a-1253725 Berlin boykottiert Atomwaffen-Konferenz], [[Frankfurter Rundschau]], 2 April 2017, retrieved 6 April 2017.</ref>\n\nIn ''[[NATO Review]]'', R\u00fchle indicated that according to proponents, it was intended to strengthen Article VI of the [[Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT), which requires good faith efforts to negotiate effective measures on nuclear disarmament.

It recognizes \"the disproportionate impact of nuclear-weapon activities on indigenous peoples\". It expresses compliance with existing law: the [[UN charter]], [[international humanitarian law]], [[international human rights law]], the very first UN resolution adopted on 24 January 1946, the NPT, the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty]] and its verification regime, as well as [[nuclear-weapon-free zone]]s. Furthermore, the \"inalienable right\" of peaceful use of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] is emphasized. Finally, social factors for peace and disarmament are recognized: [[Women's rights|participation of both women and men]], education, public conscience, \"international and regional organizations, non-governmental organizations, religious leaders, parliamentarians, academics and the ''hibakusha''\".\n\n''Article 1'' contains prohibitions against the development, testing, production, [[military reserve|stockpiling]], stationing, transfer, use and [[threat]] of use of nuclear weapons, as well as against assistance and encouragement to the prohibited activities. Finally, any direct or indirect \"control over nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices\" is forbidden.\n\n''Article 2'' requires each party to declare whether it had nuclear weapons of their own or deployed on its territory, including the elimination or conversion of related facilities.\n\n''Article 3'' requires parties that do not possess nuclear weapons to maintain their existing IAEA safeguards and, if they have not already done so, to accept safeguards based on the model for non-nuclear-weapon states under the NPT.\n\n''Article 4'' sets out general procedures for negotiations with an individual nuclear armed state becoming party to the treaty, including time limits and responsibilities. If that state has eliminated its nuclear weapons before becoming a party to the treaty, an unspecified \"competent international authority\" will verify that elimination, and the state must also conclude a safeguards agreement with the IAEA to provide credible assurance that it has not diverted nuclear material and has no undeclared nuclear material or activities. If that state has not yet destroyed its arsenal, it must negotiate with that \"competent international authority\" a time-bound plan for the verified and irreversible elimination of its nuclear weapons programme, which will submit it to the next meeting of signing states or to the next review conference, whichever comes first.\n\n''Article 5'' is about national implementation. ''Article 6'' obliges to environmental remediation and to assistance for the victims of the use and testing of nuclear weapons. According to ''Article 7'', states should assist each other to these purposes, with special responsibility of the nuclear powers. More generally, all state parties shall cooperate to facilitate the implementation of the treaty. ''Article 8'' fixes meetings of states parties, the costs of which are shared by the states according to the UN scale of assessment (''Article 9''). ''Articles 10\u201312'' are about the possibility of amendments, the settlement of disputes and the \"goal of universal adherence of all States to the Treaty\".\n\nAccording to ''Articles 13\u201315'', the treaty was open for signature from 20 September 2017 at the UN headquarters in New York. The \"Treaty shall enter into force 90 days after the fiftieth instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession\".\n\n== History, intentions and impact ==\n\n=== Preparations, 2010\u20132016 ===\n[[File:UN working group on nuclear disarmament, May 2016.jpg|thumb|right|Nations debate the idea of a nuclear-weapon-ban treaty at the UN in Geneva in May 2016.]]\nProposals for a nuclear-weapon-ban treaty first emerged following a review conference of the NPT in 2010, at which the five officially recognized nuclear-armed state parties \u2013 the United States, Russia, Britain, France and China \u2013 rejected calls for the start of negotiations on a comprehensive [[Nuclear weapons convention]].

The request of a nuclear ban could only weaken the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), regarding that the nuclear forces were blocking multi-lateral disarmament negotiations since 1995, instead were planning modernization and rearmament. Therefore, they would abdicate from their responsibility of disarmament according to the NPT, Article VI. Then the danger would grow that in reaction other nations felt less stronger bound to non-proliferation. By contrast, the nuclear weapon ban treaty would aim at a new disarmament dynamics, hence would much more recover than weaken the NPT.<ref>Xanthe Hall, [http://www.fr.de/politik/meinung/gastbeitraege/verbot-von-atomwaffen-berlin-boykottiert-atomwaffen-konferenz-a-1253725 Berlin boykottiert Atomwaffen-Konferenz], [[Frankfurter Rundschau]], 2 April 2017, retrieved 6 April 2017.</ref>\n\nIn ''[[NATO Review]]'', R\u00fchle indicated that according to proponents, it was intended to strengthen Article VI of the [[Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT), which requires good faith efforts to negotiate effective measures on nuclear disarmament.

Over 30 years later, Claytor's moderate actions on behalf of the rights of [[Women in the United States Navy|female]] and [[Sexual orientation and the United States military|gay]] service personnel as [[Secretary of the Navy]] were considered progressive for the time. He is also credited with a distinguished transportation career, including ten years as president of the [[Southern Railway (US)|Southern Railway]] and 11 years as the head of [[Amtrak]], guiding the passenger railroad through a particularly difficult period in its history. He was named the Virginian of the Year in 1977.<ref name=\"viriginayera\"/>\n\n==Early life and career==\n\nClaytor was born in [[Roanoke, Virginia]] on March 14, 1912, and grew up in both [[Virginia]] and [[Philadelphia]]. He was the son of [[Gertrude Harris Boatwright Claytor]], a lyric poet, and [[W.

He then graduated from [[Harvard Law School]] ''[[summa cum laude]]'' in 1936. He then clerked for [[Learned Hand]], Judge of the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]]. He then moved to Washington, D.C., to become law clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice [[Louis Brandeis]] before joining the prestigious [[Washington, DC|Washington]] law firm [[Covington and Burling]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===World War II \u2014 USS ''Indianapolis'' tragedy===\n\nIn 1940, soon after the start of [[World War II]], 28-year-old Claytor attempted to enlist, but was initially rejected by the [[United States Navy]] as being too old.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} He finally joined under a special provision, based upon his previous experience in sports boating.

Reagan|Reagan Administration]] from 1983 to 1989.\n\nClaytor maintained a good relationship with the [[U.S. Congress]] during his 11 years in the position. Within 7 years of being under Claytor's leadership, Amtrak was generating enough money to cover 72 percent of its $1.7 billion operating budget by 1989, up from 48 percent in 1981.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Alpert |first1=Mark |date=1989-10-23 |title=Still Chugging |journal=Fortune |volume= |issue= |pages= |publisher= |doi= |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1989/10/23/72601/index.htm |accessdate=2011-05-30}}</ref> This was achieved mainly through vigorous cost cutting and aggressive marketing.
