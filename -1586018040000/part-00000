Then in the same year, she acted in the Telugu movie ''Raithu Bharatham'', opposite superstar [[Krishna (Telugu actor)|Krishna]], directed by Tripuraneni Sriprasad alias Varaprasad.

She began with lead roles in Kannada, her mother tongue, and went on to become the most popular actress in Telugu films. In her first hit in Telugu, in 1993, she acted in the leading role alongside [[Rajendra Prasad (actor)|Rajendra Prasad]] in ''[[Rajendrudu Gajendrudu]]'', directed by [[S. V. Krishna Reddy]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The real commercial recognition came with ''[[Hello Brother (1994 film)|Hello Brother]]'' (1994), directed by commercial director E. V. V. Satyanarayana, in which she starred alongside [[Nagarjuna (actor)|Nagarjuna]] and [[Ramya Krishna]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}  She had an award-winning role in ''[[Ammoru]]'', directed by [[Kodi Ramakrishna]].

She also starred alongside South Indian superstar Rajinikanth in ''[[Arunachalam (film)|Arunachalam]]'', which became the highest-grossing film of 1997 in Tamil cinema. This stardom made her come out of the shadow of mainstream heroines and she chose scripts which had a wide potential of performance even alongside big stars which was clearly reflected in her movies. Though the industry regarded her to be the golden hand, as a former director's daughter, she always regarded the success not as a one-man show, but the teamwork between 36 departments.<ref name=\"rediff1\" />\n\nFurthermore, the critical success of ''Chudalani Vundi'', directed by Gunashekar, opposite Chiranjeevi in 1998 made her reach the pinnacle of her cinema career. She also starred along [[Kamal Haasan]] and [[Prabhudeva]] in ''Kaathala Kaathala'' in Tamil in the same year, dubbed in Telugu as ''Navvandi Lavvandi'', directed by Singeetam Srinivas. ''Pelli Peetalu'' and ''Sri Ramulayya'', ''Ninne Premista'' in Telugu and ''Doni Saagali'' in Kannada were commercially highly successful. ''Anthapuram'', directed by Krishnavamshi, stood as one of the finest performances of Soundarya in her career, winning her a State [[Nandi Award for Best Actress]] and also her second consecutive [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress]]. The producers and directors realized Soundarya's ability to be a crowd puller and the biggest plus for the promotion of the movie. Her 1999 release ''Raja'', opposite [[Venkatesh]], was another blockbuster and won her her third [[Filmfare Award]].  Her other releases, ''[[Padayappa]]'' opposite Rajinikanth, ''[[Azad (2000 film)|Azad]]'' opposite Nagarjuna and ''Premaku Velayera'', ''Premaku Swagatam'' and ''Arundathi'' further solidified her position.

Then in the same year, she acted in the Telugu movie ''Raithu Bharatham'', opposite superstar [[Krishna (Telugu actor)|Krishna]], directed by Tripuraneni Sriprasad alias Varaprasad.

She began with lead roles in Kannada, her mother tongue, and went on to become the most popular actress in Telugu films. In her first hit in Telugu, in 1993, she acted in the leading role alongside [[Rajendra Prasad (actor)|Rajendra Prasad]] in ''[[Rajendrudu Gajendrudu]]'', directed by [[S. V. Krishna Reddy]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The real commercial recognition came with ''[[Hello Brother (1994 film)|Hello Brother]]'' (1994), directed by commercial director E. V. V. Satyanarayana, in which she starred alongside [[Nagarjuna (actor)|Nagarjuna]] and [[Ramya Krishna]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}  She had an award-winning role in ''[[Ammoru]]'', directed by [[Kodi Ramakrishna]].

She got major acclaim with ''[[Ponnumani]]'', starring with [[Karthik (actor)|Karthik]] and [[Sivakumar]]. She played the role of a mentally disabled person and received good reviews for her acting.\n\n== Continuous success, critical acclaim and popularity (1995\u20132002) ==\n\nAccording to D.

She also starred alongside South Indian superstar Rajinikanth in ''[[Arunachalam (film)|Arunachalam]]'', which became the highest-grossing film of 1997 in Tamil cinema. This stardom made her come out of the shadow of mainstream heroines and she chose scripts which had a wide potential of performance even alongside big stars which was clearly reflected in her movies. Though the industry regarded her to be the golden hand, as a former director's daughter, she always regarded the success not as a one-man show, but the teamwork between 36 departments.<ref name=\"rediff1\" />\n\nFurthermore, the critical success of ''Chudalani Vundi'', directed by Gunashekar, opposite Chiranjeevi in 1998 made her reach the pinnacle of her cinema career. She also starred along [[Kamal Haasan]] and [[Prabhudeva]] in ''Kaathala Kaathala'' in Tamil in the same year, dubbed in Telugu as ''Navvandi Lavvandi'', directed by Singeetam Srinivas. ''Pelli Peetalu'' and ''Sri Ramulayya'', ''Ninne Premista'' in Telugu and ''Doni Saagali'' in Kannada were commercially highly successful. ''Anthapuram'', directed by Krishnavamshi, stood as one of the finest performances of Soundarya in her career, winning her a State [[Nandi Award for Best Actress]] and also her second consecutive [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress]]. The producers and directors realized Soundarya's ability to be a crowd puller and the biggest plus for the promotion of the movie. Her 1999 release ''Raja'', opposite [[Venkatesh]], was another blockbuster and won her her third [[Filmfare Award]].  Her other releases, ''[[Padayappa]]'' opposite Rajinikanth, ''[[Azad (2000 film)|Azad]]'' opposite Nagarjuna and ''Premaku Velayera'', ''Premaku Swagatam'' and ''Arundathi'' further solidified her position.

After the entry of the budding next generation, she slowed down, but even later she went on acting in eight films each year till 2004. She has never been proud about stardom, she has been recognized for her super talent, her directors and costars describe her as an honest, grounded and friendly person.<ref name=\"rediff1\" />\n\nDuring the period, Balakrishna is announced plans to act and direct in the remake of ''Nartanasala'', and a launch event was held in Hyderabad during March 2004.

Relieving the long-term poverty on most reservations through business partnerships by leasing land was seen as infeasible. A return to the 19th century 99-year leases was seen as a possible solution. But, an Interior Department memo said, \"a 99-year lease is in the nature of a conveyance of the land\". These battles over land had their beginnings in the 1870s when federal policy often related to wholesale taking, not leases. In the 1950s, many Native Americans believed that leases were too frequently a way for outsiders to control Indian land.\n\n{{main|Tuscarora Reservation}}\n[[Wallace \"Mad Bear\" Anderson]] was a [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] leader in New York in the 1950s.

It created events to attract the press. If successful, news outlets would seek out AIM spokespersons for interviews. Rather than relying on traditional lobbying efforts, AIM took its message directly to the American public. Its leaders looked for opportunities to gain publicity.  Sound bites such as the \"[[AIM Song]]\" became associated with the movement.\n\n== Events ==\nDuring ceremonies on Thanksgiving Day 1970 to commemorate the 350th anniversary of the Pilgrims' landing at Plymouth Rock, AIM seized the replica of the ''Mayflower'' in Boston. In 1971, members occupied [[Mount Rushmore]] for a few days, as it was created in the [[Black Hills]] of South Dakota, long sacred to the Lakota. This area was within the [[Great Sioux Reservation]] as created by the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Treaty of Fort Laramie]] in 1868.  After the discovery of [[gold]], in 1874, the federal government took the land in 1877 and sold it for mining and settlement to European Americans.\n\nNative American activists in [[Milwaukee]] staged a takeover of an abandoned Coast Guard station along the Lake Michigan. The takeover was inspired by the 1969 Alcatraz occupation. Activists cited the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Treaty of Fort Laramie]] and demanded the abandoned federal property revert to the control of the Native peoples of Milwaukee. AIM protestors retained possession of the land, and the land became the site of the first Indian Community School until 1980.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/american-indian-movement/|title=American Indian Movement {{!}} Encyclopedia of Milwaukee|website=emke.uwm.edu|access-date=2018-01-27}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1971, AIM began to highlight and protest problems with the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA), which administered programs and land trusts for Native Americans.  The group briefly occupied BIA headquarters in Washington, D.C. A brief arrest, reversal of charges for \"unlawful entry\" and a meeting with Louis Bruce, the Mohawk/Lakota BIA Commissioner, ended AIM's first event in the capital.<ref>\"B.I.A I'm Not Your Indian Any More,\" ''Akwesasne Notes'', p.47</ref>  In 1972, activists marched across country on the \"Trail of Broken Treaties\" and took over the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA), occupying it for several days and allegedly doing millions of dollars in damage.<ref>''Legislative Review'', November 1972</ref>\n\nAIM developed a 20-point list to summarize its issues with federal treaties and promises, which they publicized during their occupation in 1972. Twelve points addressed treaty responsibilities which the protesters believed the U.S. government had failed to fulfill:\n* Restore treaty-making (ended by Congress in 1871).\n* Establish a treaty commission to make new treaties (with sovereign Native Nations).\n* Provide opportunities for Indian leaders to address Congress directly.\n* Review treaty commitments and violations.\n* Have unratified treaties reviewed by the Senate.\n* Ensure that all American Indians are governed by treaty relations.\n* Provide relief to Native Nations as compensation for treaty rights violations.\n* Recognize the right of Indians to interpret treaties.\n* Create a Joint Congressional Committee to reconstruct relations with Indians.\n* Restore {{convert|110|e6acre|km2}} of land taken away from Native Nations by the United States.\n* Restore terminated rights of Native Nations.\n* Repeal state jurisdiction on Native Nations ([[Public Law 280]]).\n* Provide Federal protection for offenses against Indians.\n* Abolish the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n* Create a new office of Federal Indian Relations.\n* Remedy breakdown in the constitutionally prescribed relationships between the United States and Native Nations.\n* Ensure immunity of Native Nations from state commerce regulation, taxes, and trade restrictions.\n* Protect Indian religious freedom and cultural integrity.\n* Establish national Indian voting with local options; free national Indian organizations from governmental controls.\n* Reclaim and affirm health, housing, employment, economic development, and education for all Indian people.<ref>[http://www.aimovement.org/ \"Twenty Points\"].

They became deeply involved and led an armed occupation of Wounded Knee on the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]] in 1973.  Other events during the 1970s were designed to achieve the goal of gaining public attention.

The first walk began on February 11, 1978, with a ceremony on [[Alcatraz Island]], where a [[Sacred Pipe]] was loaded with tobacco. The Pipe was carried the entire distance. This {{convert|3200|mi|km|adj=on}}-Walk's purpose was to educate people about the government's continuing threat to Tribal Sovereignty; it rallied thousands representing many Indian Nations throughout the United States and Canada. Traditional spiritual leaders from many tribes participated, leading traditional ceremonies. International spiritual leaders like [[Nichidatsu Fujii]] also took part in the Walk.\n\nOn July 15, 1978, The Longest Walk entered Washington, D.C., with several thousand Indians and a number of non-Indian supporters.  The traditional [[American Indian elder|elders]] led them to the [[Washington Monument]], where the Pipe carried across the country was smoked. Over the following week, they held rallies at various sites to address issues: the 11 pieces of legislation, American Indian political prisoners, forced relocation at Big Mountain, the [[Navajo Nation]], etc.  Non-Indian supporters included the American boxer [[Muhammad Ali]], US Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] and the actor [[Marlon Brando]]. The Congress voted against a proposed bill to abrogate treaties with Indian Nations. During the week after the activists arrived, Congress passed the [[American Indian Religious Freedom Act]], which allowed them the use of [[peyote]] in worship. President [[Jimmy Carter]] refused to meet with representatives of The Longest Walk.\n\n==== 2008 ====\nThirty years later, AIM led the Longest Walk 2, which arrived in Washington in July 2008.  This {{convert|8200|mi|km|adj=on}}-walk had started from the San Francisco Bay area. The Longest Walk 2 had representatives from more than 100 American Indian nations, and other indigenous participants, such as [[M\u0101ori people|Maori]]. It also had non-indigenous supporters. The walk highlighted the need for protection of American Indian sacred sites, tribal sovereignty, environmental protection and action to stop [[global warming]]. Participants traveled on either the Northern Route (basically that of 1978) or the Southern Route. Participants crossed a total of 26 states on the two different routes.<ref name=parrella/>\n\n===== Northern Route =====\nThe Northern Route was led by veterans of that action. The walkers used Sacred staffs to represent their issues; the group supported the protection of sacred sites of indigenous peoples, traditional tribal sovereignty, issues related to native prisoners, and the protection of children. They also commemorated the 30th anniversary of the original Longest Walk.<ref name=parrella>{{cite web|last=Parrella |first=Bernardo |url=http://globalvoices.org/2008/07/25/longest-walk-2-for-native-americans-rights-and-environmental-sustainability/ |title=Global Voices in English \" USA: Longest Walk 2 for Native Americans rights |publisher=[[Global Voices Online]] |date=July 25, 2008 |accessdate=2010-09-26}}</ref>\n\n===== Southern Route =====\nWalkers along the Southern Route picked up more than 8,000 bags of garbage on their way to Washington. In Washington, the Southern Route delivered a 30-page manifesto, \"The Manifesto of Change\", and a list of demands, including mitigation for climate change, a call for environmental sustainability plans, protection of sacred sites, and renewal of improvement to Native American sovereignty and health.<ref name=parrella/>\n\n=== Connection to other civil rights movements ===\nAIM's leaders spoke out against injustices against their people, taking inspiration from the [[African American]] leaders of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. AIM leaders talked about high unemployment, slum housing, and racist treatment, fought for treaty rights and the reclamation of tribal land, and advocated on behalf of urban Indians.\n\nWith its provocative events and advocacy for Indian rights, AIM attracted scrutiny from the Department of Justice (DOJ).<ref>Ward Churchill; Jim Vander Wall.

They were protesting what they said was the local corrupt government, along with federal issues affecting Indian reservation communities, as well as the lack of justice from border counties. Indians from many other communities, primarily urban Indians, mobilized to come and join the occupation. The FBI dispatched agents and [[US Marshals]] to cordon off the site. Later a higher-ranking DOJ representative took control of the government's response. Through the resulting siege that lasted for 71 days, twelve people were wounded, including an FBI agent left paralyzed. In April at least two people - a Cherokee and a Lakota activist - died of gunfire (at this point, the Oglala Lakota called an end to the occupation).  Additionally, two other people, one of them an African American civil rights activist, [[Ray Robinson (activist)|Ray Robinson]], went missing, and are believed to have been killed during the occupation, though their bodies have never been found.<ref name=\"FrontPage Mag\">{{cite web |url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/2014/dgreenfield/fbi-confirms-black-civil-rights-activist-was-murdered-by-aim-at-wounded-knee/ |title=FBI Confirms Black Civil Rights Activist was Murdered by AIM at Wounded Knee |work=FrontPageMag |first=Daniel |last=Greenfield |date=19 February 2014 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Missing Persons of America\">{{cite web |url=http://www.missingpersonsofamerica.com/2013/07/ray-robinson-whatever-happened-to-civil.html |title=Ray Robinson: Whatever happened to the civil rights activist at Wounded Knee?  |work=Missing Persons of America |first= |last= |date=15 July 2014 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"The Grio\">{{cite web |url=http://thegrio.com/2014/02/20/fbi-confirms-activist-ray-robinson-was-killed-in-south-dakota-in-1973/#s:ray-robinson-widow |title=FBI confirms activist Ray Robinson was killed in South Dakota in 1973 |work=The Grio |first=Dirk |last=Lammers |date=20 February 2014 |accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref> Afterward, 1200 American Indians were arrested.

[[NCAA]] schools such as [[Florida State University]], [[University of Utah]], [[University of Illinois]] and [[Central Michigan University]] have negotiated with the tribes whose names or images they had used for permission for continued use and to collaborate on portraying the mascot in a way that is intended to honor Native Americans.\n\n=== Goals and commitments ===\nAIM has been committed to improving conditions faced by native peoples. It founded institutions to address needs, including the Heart of The Earth School, Little Earth Housing, International Indian Treaty Council, AIM StreetMedics, [[American Indian Opportunities and Industrialization Center]] (one of the largest Indian job training programs), KILI radio and Indian Legal Rights Centers.<ref>[http://www.aimovement.org AIMovement].</ref>\n\nIn 1971, several members of AIM, including [[Dennis Banks]] and [[Russell Means]], traveled to [[Mt. Rushmore]].  They converged at the mountain in order to protest the illegal seizure of the Sioux Nation's sacred [[Black Hills]] in 1877 by the United States federal government, in violation of its earlier 1868 [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Treaty of Fort Laramie]].

After their trial and conviction, the Hares received the minimal sentence for [[manslaughter]]. Members of AIM went to Gordon to protest the sentences, arguing they were part of a pattern of law enforcement that did not provide justice to Native Americans in counties and communities bordering [[Indian reservation]]s.<ref name=\"Sanchez and Stuckey\">Sanchez, John and Stuckey, E.

The offender was jailed, but released on a $5000 bond and charged with second degree [[manslaughter]]. Believing the charges to be too lenient, a group of AIM members and leaders from Pine Ridge Reservation and leaders travelled to the county seat of [[Custer, South Dakota]], to meet with the prosecutor. Police in riot gear allowed only four people to enter the county courthouse. The talks were not successful, and tempers rose over the police treatment; AIM activists caused $2 million in damages by attacking and burning the Custer Chamber of Commerce building, the courthouse, and two patrol cars. Many of the AIM demonstrators were arrested and charged; numerous people served sentences, including the mother of [[Wesley Bad Heart Bull]].<ref name=\"Miner\"/>\n\n=== 1973 Wounded Knee Incident ===\n{{main|Wounded Knee Incident}}\nIn addition to the problems of violence in the border towns, many traditional people at the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]] were unhappy with the government of [[Dick Wilson (tribal chairman)|Richard Wilson]], elected in 1972.  When their effort to impeach him in February 1973 failed, they met to plan protests and action. Many people on the reservation were unhappy about its longstanding poverty and failures of the federal government to live up to its treaties with Indian nations.  The women elders encouraged the men to act. On February 27, 1973, about 300 [[Oglala Lakota]] and AIM activists went to the hamlet of [[Wounded Knee, South Dakota|Wounded Knee]] for their protest. It developed into a 71-day siege, with the FBI cordoning off the area by using US Marshals and later National Guard units.<ref name=\"Miner\"/> The occupation was symbolically held at the site of the 1890 [[Wounded Knee Massacre]]. The Oglala Lakota demanded a revival of treaty negotiations to begin to correct relations with the federal government, the respect of their sovereignty, and the removal of Wilson from office. The American Indians occupied the Sacred Heart Church, the Gildersleeve Trading Post and numerous homes of the village. Although periodic negotiations were held between AIM spokesman and U.S. government negotiators, gunfire occurred on both sides. A US Marshal, Lloyd Grimm, was wounded severely and paralyzed. In April, a Cherokee from North Carolina and a Lakota AIM member were shot and killed. The elders ended the occupation then.<ref name=\"Crow Dog and Erdoes\" />\n\nFor about a month afterward, journalists frequently interviewed Indian spokesmen and the event received international coverage. The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] then excluded the press from access to Wounded Knee.  The [[Academy Awards]] ceremony was held in [[Hollywood]], where the actor [[Marlon Brando]], a supporter of AIM, asked an Apache actress, [[Sacheen Littlefeather]], to speak at the Oscars on his behalf. He had been nominated for his performance in ''[[The Godfather]]'' and won. Littlefeather arrived in full Apache regalia and read his statement that, owing to the \"poor treatment of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] in the film industry,\" Brando would not accept the award.  In interviews, she also talked about the Wounded Knee occupation. The event grabbed the attention of the US and the world media. The movement considered the Awards ceremony publicity, together with Wounded Knee, as a major event and public relations victory, as polls showed that Americans were sympathetic to the Indian cause.\n\n=== Pine Ridge Reservation violence ===\nAIM members continued to be active at Pine Ridge, although Wilson stayed in office and was re-elected in 1974 in a contested election. Violent deaths rose during this period in what has been called a \"reign of terror\", and more than 60 political opponents of his died during the next three years in violent incidents. On June 26, 1975, two FBI agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams were on the Pine Ridge Reservation searching for someone who was wanted for questioning relating to an assault and robbery of two ranch hands. The FBI agents were driving in two unmarked cars and followed a red pick-up truck matching the suspects description. The FBI agents were shot at by the occupants of the vehicle and others. The agents managed to fire five rounds before being killed, while at least 125 bullets were fired at them. The agents were also shot at close range with physical evidence suggesting that they had been executed. Later reinforcements arrived, and Joe Stuntz, an AIM member who had taken part in the shootout was fatally shot and was found wearing Coler's FBI jacket. According to the FBI, Stunz had been firing at agents when he was killed. Three AIM members were indicted for the murders: Darryl Butler, Robert Robideau and [[Leonard Peltier]], who had escaped to Canada. An eyewitness testified that the three men joined the shooting after it had started. In 1991, Peltier admitted firing at Agents in an interview. Both Butler and Robideau were acquitted at trial while Peltier was tried separately and controversially convicted in 1976 and is serving two consecutive life sentences. [[Amnesty International]] has referred to his case under its Unfair Trials category.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060506041458/http://www.indiancountry.com/content.cfm?id=747 Unsolved murders debunked by FBI Case by case puts rumours to rest] Indian Country Today</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/annual-report-usa-2010?page=4 |title=Annual Report: USA 2010 &#124; Amnesty International USA |publisher=Amnestyusa.org |date=2010-05-28 |access-date=2012-11-12}}</ref><ref>[https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/history/events/remember-leonard-peltier-but-also-remember-joe-stuntz/ Remember Leonard Peltier, but also Remember Joe Stuntz], Indian Country Today, June 28, 2016.</ref><ref name=\"Matthiessen, Peter 1992\">Matthiessen, Peter.

They confronted him and expelled him from AIM at a press conference in March 1975. Durham's girlfriend, Jancita Eagle Deer, was later found dead after being struck by a speeding car while many believed Durham was guilty.<ref name=\"Matthiessen, Peter 1992\"/> Durham was also scheduled to testify in front of the Church Committee, but that hearing was suspended due to the illegal invasion of Pine Ridge reservation and the subsequent shoot out.<ref name=\"Matthiessen, Peter 1992\"/>\n\nWith some members in fugitive status after the Pine Ridge shootout, suspicions about FBI infiltration remained high.

Her decomposing body was found February 1976. After the coroner failed to find the bullet hole in Aquash's head, the FBI severed both of her hands and sent them to Washington, D.C., allegedly for identification purposes, then buried her as a Jane Doe.<ref name=\"Matthiessen, Peter 1992\"/> Aquash's body was later exhumed and given a second burial.\n\n=== 1980s support of Nicaraguan Miskito Indians ===\nDuring the [[Sandinista]]/Indian conflict in [[Nicaragua]] of the mid-1980s, [[Russell Means]] sided with [[Miskito people|Miskito Indians]] opposing the Sandinista government. The Miskito charged the government with forcing relocations of as many as 8,500 Miskito.

It invited representatives from numerous indigenous nations, and delegates from 98 international groups attended the meeting.  The sacred pipe serves as a symbol of the Nations \"common bonds of spirituality, ties to the land and respect for traditional cultures\".  The IITC focuses on issues such as treaty and land rights, rights and protection of indigenous children, protection of sacred sites, and religious freedom.\n\nThe International Indian Treaty Council (IITC) uses networking, technical assistance, and coalition building.  In 1977, the IITC became a Non-Governmental Organization with Consultative Status to the United Nations Economic and Social Council. The organization concentrates on involving Indigenous Peoples in U.N. forums.

The AIM-Grand Governing Council is based in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], and associated with leadership by [[Clyde Bellecourt]] and his brother Vernon Bellecourt (who died in 2007). The GGC tends toward a more centralized, controlled political philosophy.\n\nThe [[American Indian Movement of Colorado|AIM-International Confederation of Autonomous Chapters]], based in [[Denver, Colorado]], was founded by thirteen AIM chapters in 1993 at a meeting in Denver, Colorado. The group issued its [http://www.thepeoplespaths.net/articles/aimtruth.htm Edgewood Declaration], citing organizational grievances and complaining of authoritarian leadership by the Bellecourts.  Ideological differences were growing, with the AIM-International Confederation of Autonomous Chapters taking a spiritual, perhaps more mainstream, approach to activism. The autonomous chapters group argues that AIM has always been organized as a series of decentralized, autonomous chapters, with local leadership accountable to local constituencies. The autonomous chapters reject the assertions of central control by the Minneapolis group as contrary both to indigenous political traditions and to the original philosophy of AIM.<ref>Waterman Wittstock, Laura; Salinas, Elaine.

According to public documents obtained under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA), advanced coordination occurred between federal [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] staff and the authors of a twenty-point proposal drafted with the help of the AIM for delivery to the United States government officials focused on proposals intended to enhance US\u2013Indian relations.\n\nIn the decades since AIM's founding, the group has led protests advocating [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] American interests, inspired cultural renewal, monitored police activities and coordinated employment programs in cities and in rural reservation communities across the United States and indigenous interests outside the United States as well.\n\n== Background ==\n=== 1950s ===\n{{main|Uranium mining and the Navajo people}}\nProceeding the [[Indian termination policy|Indian Termination Policies]], an official policy directive of the United States government from 1940 to the early 1960s directed by multiple executive administrations (both Democrat and Republican), uranium mining operations were established across Navajo tribal lands, offering the only available employment to the Navajo people. Although Navajo workers were initially enthusiastic about employment, it is evident that the U.S. government had been aware of the harmful risks associated with uranium mining since the 1930s and neglected to inform the Navajo communities. In addition, the majority of Navajo workers did not speak English, and therefore had no understanding of radiation, nor a translation for the word in their language.<ref name=\"Brugge 1410\u20131419\">{{Cite journal|last=Brugge|first=Doug|last2=Goble|first2=Rob|date=September 2002|title=The History of Uranium Mining and the Navajo People|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=92|issue=9|pages=1410\u20131419|issn=0090-0036|pmc=3222290|pmid=12197966|doi=10.2105/ajph.92.9.1410}}</ref> The open and now abandoned uranium mines continue to poison and pollute the Navajo Communities today, and clean-up is in slow progress.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/04/10/473547227/for-the-navajo-nation-uranium-minings-deadly-legacy-lingers|title=For The Navajo Nation, Uranium Mining's Deadly Legacy Lingers|last=Welch|first=Maria|last2=contamination|first2=a Navajo researcher studying the effects of uranium|website=NPR.org|access-date=2019-05-22}}</ref> The Navajo people feel that this was in violation of the [[Treaty of Bosque Redondo|Treaty of 1868]] in which the Bureau of Indian Affairs was assigned to care for Navajo economic, educational, and health services.<ref name=\"Brugge 1410\u20131419\"/>\n\n=== 1960s ===\nOn March 6, 1968, [[LBJ|President Johnson]] signed Executive Order 11399, establishing the [[National Council on Indian Opportunity]] (NCIO). President Johnson said \"the time has come to focus our efforts on the plight of the American Indian\" and NCIO's formation would \"launch an undivided, Government-wide effort in this area\". While knowing little of the American Indian issues, Johnson tried to connect the nation's trust responsibility to the tribes and nations to civil rights, an area with which he was much more familiar.<ref>[http://academic.lexisnexis.com/pdf/marketing_guides/102686.pdf \"Records of the National Council on Indian Opportunity\"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, LexisNexis</ref>\n\nIn Congress, the Democratic chairman of the House Subcommittee on Indian Affairs, [[James A. Haley|James Haley]] from Florida, supported Indian rights; for example, he thought Indians should participate more in \"policy matters\", but \"the right of self-determination is in the Congress as a representative of all the people\".<ref>Thomas Clarkin.

Relieving the long-term poverty on most reservations through business partnerships by leasing land was seen as infeasible. A return to the 19th century 99-year leases was seen as a possible solution. But, an Interior Department memo said, \"a 99-year lease is in the nature of a conveyance of the land\". These battles over land had their beginnings in the 1870s when federal policy often related to wholesale taking, not leases. In the 1950s, many Native Americans believed that leases were too frequently a way for outsiders to control Indian land.\n\n{{main|Tuscarora Reservation}}\n[[Wallace \"Mad Bear\" Anderson]] was a [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] leader in New York in the 1950s. He struggled to resist the New York City planner [[Robert Moses]]' plan to take tribal land in upstate New York for use in a state hydropower project to supply New York City. The struggle ended in a bitter compromise.<ref>Wilson, Edmund. ''Apologies to the Iroquois : with a study of The Mohawks in high steel by Joseph Mitchell.''

It created events to attract the press. If successful, news outlets would seek out AIM spokespersons for interviews. Rather than relying on traditional lobbying efforts, AIM took its message directly to the American public. Its leaders looked for opportunities to gain publicity.  Sound bites such as the \"[[AIM Song]]\" became associated with the movement.\n\n== Events ==\nDuring ceremonies on Thanksgiving Day 1970 to commemorate the 350th anniversary of the Pilgrims' landing at Plymouth Rock, AIM seized the replica of the ''Mayflower'' in Boston. In 1971, members occupied [[Mount Rushmore]] for a few days, as it was created in the [[Black Hills]] of South Dakota, long sacred to the Lakota. This area was within the [[Great Sioux Reservation]] as created by the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Treaty of Fort Laramie]] in 1868.  After the discovery of [[gold]], in 1874, the federal government took the land in 1877 and sold it for mining and settlement to European Americans.\n\nNative American activists in [[Milwaukee]] staged a takeover of an abandoned Coast Guard station along the Lake Michigan. The takeover was inspired by the 1969 Alcatraz occupation. Activists cited the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Treaty of Fort Laramie]] and demanded the abandoned federal property revert to the control of the Native peoples of Milwaukee. AIM protestors retained possession of the land, and the land became the site of the first Indian Community School until 1980.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/american-indian-movement/|title=American Indian Movement {{!}} Encyclopedia of Milwaukee|website=emke.uwm.edu|access-date=2018-01-27}}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1971, AIM began to highlight and protest problems with the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA), which administered programs and land trusts for Native Americans.  The group briefly occupied BIA headquarters in Washington, D.C. A brief arrest, reversal of charges for \"unlawful entry\" and a meeting with Louis Bruce, the Mohawk/Lakota BIA Commissioner, ended AIM's first event in the capital.<ref>\"B.I.A I'm Not Your Indian Any More,\" ''Akwesasne Notes'', p.47</ref>  In 1972, activists marched across country on the \"Trail of Broken Treaties\" and took over the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA), occupying it for several days and allegedly doing millions of dollars in damage.<ref>''Legislative Review'', November 1972</ref>\n\nAIM developed a 20-point list to summarize its issues with federal treaties and promises, which they publicized during their occupation in 1972. Twelve points addressed treaty responsibilities which the protesters believed the U.S. government had failed to fulfill:\n* Restore treaty-making (ended by Congress in 1871).\n* Establish a treaty commission to make new treaties (with sovereign Native Nations).\n* Provide opportunities for Indian leaders to address Congress directly.\n* Review treaty commitments and violations.\n* Have unratified treaties reviewed by the Senate.\n* Ensure that all American Indians are governed by treaty relations.\n* Provide relief to Native Nations as compensation for treaty rights violations.\n* Recognize the right of Indians to interpret treaties.\n* Create a Joint Congressional Committee to reconstruct relations with Indians.\n* Restore {{convert|110|e6acre|km2}} of land taken away from Native Nations by the United States.\n* Restore terminated rights of Native Nations.\n* Repeal state jurisdiction on Native Nations ([[Public Law 280]]).\n* Provide Federal protection for offenses against Indians.\n* Abolish the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n* Create a new office of Federal Indian Relations.\n* Remedy breakdown in the constitutionally prescribed relationships between the United States and Native Nations.\n* Ensure immunity of Native Nations from state commerce regulation, taxes, and trade restrictions.\n* Protect Indian religious freedom and cultural integrity.\n* Establish national Indian voting with local options; free national Indian organizations from governmental controls.\n* Reclaim and affirm health, housing, employment, economic development, and education for all Indian people.<ref>[http://www.aimovement.org/ \"Twenty Points\"].

They became deeply involved and led an armed occupation of Wounded Knee on the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]] in 1973.  Other events during the 1970s were designed to achieve the goal of gaining public attention.

The first walk began on February 11, 1978, with a ceremony on [[Alcatraz Island]], where a [[Sacred Pipe]] was loaded with tobacco. The Pipe was carried the entire distance. This {{convert|3200|mi|km|adj=on}}-Walk's purpose was to educate people about the government's continuing threat to Tribal Sovereignty; it rallied thousands representing many Indian Nations throughout the United States and Canada. Traditional spiritual leaders from many tribes participated, leading traditional ceremonies. International spiritual leaders like [[Nichidatsu Fujii]] also took part in the Walk.\n\nOn July 15, 1978, The Longest Walk entered Washington, D.C., with several thousand Indians and a number of non-Indian supporters.  The traditional [[American Indian elder|elders]] led them to the [[Washington Monument]], where the Pipe carried across the country was smoked. Over the following week, they held rallies at various sites to address issues: the 11 pieces of legislation, American Indian political prisoners, forced relocation at Big Mountain, the [[Navajo Nation]], etc.  Non-Indian supporters included the American boxer [[Muhammad Ali]], US Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] and the actor [[Marlon Brando]]. The Congress voted against a proposed bill to abrogate treaties with Indian Nations. During the week after the activists arrived, Congress passed the [[American Indian Religious Freedom Act]], which allowed them the use of [[peyote]] in worship. President [[Jimmy Carter]] refused to meet with representatives of The Longest Walk.\n\n==== 2008 ====\nThirty years later, AIM led the Longest Walk 2, which arrived in Washington in July 2008.  This {{convert|8200|mi|km|adj=on}}-walk had started from the San Francisco Bay area. The Longest Walk 2 had representatives from more than 100 American Indian nations, and other indigenous participants, such as [[M\u0101ori people|Maori]]. It also had non-indigenous supporters. The walk highlighted the need for protection of American Indian sacred sites, tribal sovereignty, environmental protection and action to stop [[global warming]]. Participants traveled on either the Northern Route (basically that of 1978) or the Southern Route. Participants crossed a total of 26 states on the two different routes.<ref name=parrella/>\n\n===== Northern Route =====\nThe Northern Route was led by veterans of that action. The walkers used Sacred staffs to represent their issues; the group supported the protection of sacred sites of indigenous peoples, traditional tribal sovereignty, issues related to native prisoners, and the protection of children. They also commemorated the 30th anniversary of the original Longest Walk.<ref name=parrella>{{cite web|last=Parrella |first=Bernardo |url=http://globalvoices.org/2008/07/25/longest-walk-2-for-native-americans-rights-and-environmental-sustainability/ |title=Global Voices in English \" USA: Longest Walk 2 for Native Americans rights |publisher=[[Global Voices Online]] |date=July 25, 2008 |accessdate=2010-09-26}}</ref>\n\n===== Southern Route =====\nWalkers along the Southern Route picked up more than 8,000 bags of garbage on their way to Washington. In Washington, the Southern Route delivered a 30-page manifesto, \"The Manifesto of Change\", and a list of demands, including mitigation for climate change, a call for environmental sustainability plans, protection of sacred sites, and renewal of improvement to Native American sovereignty and health.<ref name=parrella/>\n\n=== Connection to other civil rights movements ===\nAIM's leaders spoke out against injustices against their people, taking inspiration from the [[African American]] leaders of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. AIM leaders talked about high unemployment, slum housing, and racist treatment, fought for treaty rights and the reclamation of tribal land, and advocated on behalf of urban Indians.\n\nWith its provocative events and advocacy for Indian rights, AIM attracted scrutiny from the Department of Justice (DOJ).<ref>Ward Churchill; Jim Vander Wall.

They were protesting what they said was the local corrupt government, along with federal issues affecting Indian reservation communities, as well as the lack of justice from border counties. Indians from many other communities, primarily urban Indians, mobilized to come and join the occupation. The FBI dispatched agents and [[US Marshals]] to cordon off the site. Later a higher-ranking DOJ representative took control of the government's response. Through the resulting siege that lasted for 71 days, twelve people were wounded, including an FBI agent left paralyzed. In April at least two people - a Cherokee and a Lakota activist - died of gunfire (at this point, the Oglala Lakota called an end to the occupation).

Protesters held signs with slogans such as \"Indians are people not mascots\". or \"Being Indian is not a character you can play\".<ref>[https://archive.is/20110707184049/http://media.www.asuherald.com/media/storage/paper898/news/2006/01/12/News/Activists.Protest.Indian.As.Mascot-1768739.shtml \"Activists Protest Indian as Mascot\"], ''The Herald of Arkansas State'', 12 January 2006, Arkansas State University, accessed 8 April 2009</ref>\n\nAlthough sports teams had ignored such requests by individual tribes for years, AIM received attention in the mascot debate. [[NCAA]] schools such as [[Florida State University]], [[University of Utah]], [[University of Illinois]] and [[Central Michigan University]] have negotiated with the tribes whose names or images they had used for permission for continued use and to collaborate on portraying the mascot in a way that is intended to honor Native Americans.\n\n=== Goals and commitments ===\nAIM has been committed to improving conditions faced by native peoples. It founded institutions to address needs, including the Heart of The Earth School, Little Earth Housing, International Indian Treaty Council, AIM StreetMedics, [[American Indian Opportunities and Industrialization Center]] (one of the largest Indian job training programs), KILI radio and Indian Legal Rights Centers.<ref>[http://www.aimovement.org AIMovement].</ref>\n\nIn 1971, several members of AIM, including [[Dennis Banks]] and [[Russell Means]], traveled to [[Mt. Rushmore]].  They converged at the mountain in order to protest the illegal seizure of the Sioux Nation's sacred [[Black Hills]] in 1877 by the United States federal government, in violation of its earlier 1868 [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Treaty of Fort Laramie]]. The protest began to publicize the issues of the American Indian Movement.<ref name=\"Miner\">Miner, Marlyce.

The government offered financial compensation, but the Oglala Sioux have refused it, insisting on return of the land to their people.  The settlement money is earning interest.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Lakotas and the Black Hills, The Struggle for Sacred Ground|last=Ostler|first=Jeffrey|publisher=Viking Penguin|year=2010|isbn=978-0-670-02195-6|location=New York, NY|pages=188}}</ref>\n\n== Work at Pine Ridge Indian Reservation ==\n=== Border town cases ===\nIn 1972, Raymond Yellow Thunder, a 51-year-old [[Oglala Lakota]] from [[Pine Ridge Reservation]], was murdered in [[Gordon, Nebraska]], by two brothers, Leslie and Melvin Hare, younger white men. After their trial and conviction, the Hares received the minimal sentence for [[manslaughter]]. Members of AIM went to Gordon to protest the sentences, arguing they were part of a pattern of law enforcement that did not provide justice to Native Americans in counties and communities bordering [[Indian reservation]]s.<ref name=\"Sanchez and Stuckey\">Sanchez, John and Stuckey, E. Mary. \"The Rhetoric of American Indian Activism in the 1960s and 1970s.\" ''Communication Quarterly'' (2000) pp. 120-136 {{OCLC|93861305}}</ref>  \n\nIn the winter of 1973, [[Wesley Bad Heart Bull]], a Lakota, was stabbed to death at a bar in South Dakota by Darrell Schmitz, a white male. The offender was jailed, but released on a $5000 bond and charged with second degree [[manslaughter]]. Believing the charges to be too lenient, a group of AIM members and leaders from Pine Ridge Reservation and leaders travelled to the county seat of [[Custer, South Dakota]], to meet with the prosecutor. Police in riot gear allowed only four people to enter the county courthouse. The talks were not successful, and tempers rose over the police treatment; AIM activists caused $2 million in damages by attacking and burning the Custer Chamber of Commerce building, the courthouse, and two patrol cars. Many of the AIM demonstrators were arrested and charged; numerous people served sentences, including the mother of [[Wesley Bad Heart Bull]].<ref name=\"Miner\"/>\n\n=== 1973 Wounded Knee Incident ===\n{{main|Wounded Knee Incident}}\nIn addition to the problems of violence in the border towns, many traditional people at the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]] were unhappy with the government of [[Dick Wilson (tribal chairman)|Richard Wilson]], elected in 1972.  When their effort to impeach him in February 1973 failed, they met to plan protests and action. Many people on the reservation were unhappy about its longstanding poverty and failures of the federal government to live up to its treaties with Indian nations.  The women elders encouraged the men to act. On February 27, 1973, about 300 [[Oglala Lakota]] and AIM activists went to the hamlet of [[Wounded Knee, South Dakota|Wounded Knee]] for their protest. It developed into a 71-day siege, with the FBI cordoning off the area by using US Marshals and later National Guard units.<ref name=\"Miner\"/> The occupation was symbolically held at the site of the 1890 [[Wounded Knee Massacre]]. The Oglala Lakota demanded a revival of treaty negotiations to begin to correct relations with the federal government, the respect of their sovereignty, and the removal of Wilson from office. The American Indians occupied the Sacred Heart Church, the Gildersleeve Trading Post and numerous homes of the village. Although periodic negotiations were held between AIM spokesman and U.S. government negotiators, gunfire occurred on both sides. A US Marshal, Lloyd Grimm, was wounded severely and paralyzed. In April, a Cherokee from North Carolina and a Lakota AIM member were shot and killed. The elders ended the occupation then.<ref name=\"Crow Dog and Erdoes\" />\n\nFor about a month afterward, journalists frequently interviewed Indian spokesmen and the event received international coverage. The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] then excluded the press from access to Wounded Knee.  The [[Academy Awards]] ceremony was held in [[Hollywood]], where the actor [[Marlon Brando]], a supporter of AIM, asked an Apache actress, [[Sacheen Littlefeather]], to speak at the Oscars on his behalf. He had been nominated for his performance in ''[[The Godfather]]'' and won. Littlefeather arrived in full Apache regalia and read his statement that, owing to the \"poor treatment of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] in the film industry,\" Brando would not accept the award.  In interviews, she also talked about the Wounded Knee occupation. The event grabbed the attention of the US and the world media. The movement considered the Awards ceremony publicity, together with Wounded Knee, as a major event and public relations victory, as polls showed that Americans were sympathetic to the Indian cause.\n\n=== Pine Ridge Reservation violence ===\nAIM members continued to be active at Pine Ridge, although Wilson stayed in office and was re-elected in 1974 in a contested election. Violent deaths rose during this period in what has been called a \"reign of terror\", and more than 60 political opponents of his died during the next three years in violent incidents. On June 26, 1975, two FBI agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams were on the Pine Ridge Reservation searching for someone who was wanted for questioning relating to an assault and robbery of two ranch hands. The FBI agents were driving in two unmarked cars and followed a red pick-up truck matching the suspects description. The FBI agents were shot at by the occupants of the vehicle and others. The agents managed to fire five rounds before being killed, while at least 125 bullets were fired at them. The agents were also shot at close range with physical evidence suggesting that they had been executed. Later reinforcements arrived, and Joe Stuntz, an AIM member who had taken part in the shootout was fatally shot and was found wearing Coler's FBI jacket. According to the FBI, Stunz had been firing at agents when he was killed. Three AIM members were indicted for the murders: Darryl Butler, Robert Robideau and [[Leonard Peltier]], who had escaped to Canada. An eyewitness testified that the three men joined the shooting after it had started. In 1991, Peltier admitted firing at Agents in an interview. Both Butler and Robideau were acquitted at trial while Peltier was tried separately and controversially convicted in 1976 and is serving two consecutive life sentences. [[Amnesty International]] has referred to his case under its Unfair Trials category.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060506041458/http://www.indiancountry.com/content.cfm?id=747 Unsolved murders debunked by FBI Case by case puts rumours to rest] Indian Country Today</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/annual-report-usa-2010?page=4 |title=Annual Report: USA 2010 &#124; Amnesty International USA |publisher=Amnestyusa.org |date=2010-05-28 |access-date=2012-11-12}}</ref><ref>[https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/history/events/remember-leonard-peltier-but-also-remember-joe-stuntz/ Remember Leonard Peltier, but also Remember Joe Stuntz], Indian Country Today, June 28, 2016.</ref><ref name=\"Matthiessen, Peter 1992\">Matthiessen, Peter.

They confronted him and expelled him from AIM at a press conference in March 1975. Durham's girlfriend, Jancita Eagle Deer, was later found dead after being struck by a speeding car while many believed Durham was guilty.<ref name=\"Matthiessen, Peter 1992\"/> Durham was also scheduled to testify in front of the Church Committee, but that hearing was suspended due to the illegal invasion of Pine Ridge reservation and the subsequent shoot out.<ref name=\"Matthiessen, Peter 1992\"/>\n\nWith some members in fugitive status after the Pine Ridge shootout, suspicions about FBI infiltration remained high.  For various reasons, [[Anna Mae Aquash]], the highest-ranking woman in AIM, was mistakenly suspected of being an informant, even after she had voiced suspicions about Durham. Aquash had also been threatened by FBI agent David Price<ref name=\"Matthiessen, Peter 1992\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rapidcityjournal.com/news/witness-testifies-fbi-agent-threatened-aquash-s-life/article_0292eb72-ff36-11df-8d22-001cc4c03286.html|title=Witness testifies FBI agent threatened Aquash's life|first=Heidi Bell Gease Journal|last=staff}}</ref> According to testimony at trials in 2004 and 2010 of men convicted of her murder, she was interrogated in the fall of 1975. In mid-December she was taken from Denver, Colorado, to Rapid City, South Dakota, and interrogated again, then taken to Rosebud Reservation and finally to a far corner of Pine Ridge Reservation, where she was killed by a gunshot wound to the back of the head. Her decomposing body was found February 1976. After the coroner failed to find the bullet hole in Aquash's head, the FBI severed both of her hands and sent them to Washington, D.C., allegedly for identification purposes, then buried her as a Jane Doe.<ref name=\"Matthiessen, Peter 1992\"/> Aquash's body was later exhumed and given a second burial.\n\n=== 1980s support of Nicaraguan Miskito Indians ===\nDuring the [[Sandinista]]/Indian conflict in [[Nicaragua]] of the mid-1980s, [[Russell Means]] sided with [[Miskito people|Miskito Indians]] opposing the Sandinista government. The Miskito charged the government with forcing relocations of as many as 8,500 Miskito.

This was one of many occasions when Indian activists used the island as the location of an event since the [[Occupation of Alcatraz]] in 1969, led by the [[United Indians of All Tribes]], a student group from San Francisco.

The Tokama Institute, a division of the AIOIC, is focused on helping American Indians acquire the foundational skills and knowledge in order to obtain a successful career. Aside from post-secondary institutions, AIM has helped develop and establish its own K-12 schools including [[Heart of the Earth Survival School]] and the Little Red Schoolhouse both located in Minneapolis. Further, AIM has led to the establishment of [[Women of All Red Nations]] (WARN). Established in 1974, WARN has put women at the forefront of the organization and focused its energies in combating sexism, government sterilization policies, and other injustices.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Johansen|first1=Bruce E.|title=Encyclopedia of the American Indian Movement|date=2013|publisher=Greenwood|location=Santa Barbara, California|isbn=978-1-4408-03178|page=290}}</ref> Other Native American organizations include NATIVE (Native American Traditions, Ideals, Values Educational Society), LISN (League of Indigenous Sovereign Nations), EZLN ([[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]]), and the IPC ([[Indigenous Peoples Caucus]]).<ref name=\"Meyer, John M. 2002\" /> Although each group may have its own specific goals or focus, they are all fighting for the same principles of respect and equality for Native Americans. The Northwest Territories Indian Brotherhood, the Committee of Original People's Entitlement were two organization that spearheaded the native rights movement in northern Canada during the 1960s.\n\n== International Indian Treaty Council ==\nAIM established the International Indian Treaty Council (IITC) in June 1974.  It invited representatives from numerous indigenous nations, and delegates from 98 international groups attended the meeting.  The sacred pipe serves as a symbol of the Nations \"common bonds of spirituality, ties to the land and respect for traditional cultures\".  The IITC focuses on issues such as treaty and land rights, rights and protection of indigenous children, protection of sacred sites, and religious freedom.\n\nThe International Indian Treaty Council (IITC) uses networking, technical assistance, and coalition building.  In 1977, the IITC became a Non-Governmental Organization with Consultative Status to the United Nations Economic and Social Council. The organization concentrates on involving Indigenous Peoples in U.N. forums.  In addition, the IITC strives to bring awareness about the issues concerning Indigenous Peoples to non-Indigenous organizations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treatycouncil.org/about.htm|title=International Indian Treaty Council|website=www.treatycouncil.org}}</ref>\n\n=== United Nations adoption of indigenous peoples' rights ===\nOn September 13, 2007, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the \"Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\".

The AIM-Grand Governing Council is based in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], and associated with leadership by [[Clyde Bellecourt]] and his brother Vernon Bellecourt (who died in 2007). The GGC tends toward a more centralized, controlled political philosophy.\n\nThe [[American Indian Movement of Colorado|AIM-International Confederation of Autonomous Chapters]], based in [[Denver, Colorado]], was founded by thirteen AIM chapters in 1993 at a meeting in Denver, Colorado. The group issued its [http://www.thepeoplespaths.net/articles/aimtruth.htm Edgewood Declaration], citing organizational grievances and complaining of authoritarian leadership by the Bellecourts.  Ideological differences were growing, with the AIM-International Confederation of Autonomous Chapters taking a spiritual, perhaps more mainstream, approach to activism. The autonomous chapters group argues that AIM has always been organized as a series of decentralized, autonomous chapters, with local leadership accountable to local constituencies. The autonomous chapters reject the assertions of central control by the Minneapolis group as contrary both to indigenous political traditions and to the original philosophy of AIM.<ref>Waterman Wittstock, Laura; Salinas, Elaine.

The \"highest-ranking\" woman in AIM at the time, she had been shot execution style in mid-December 1975 and left in a far corner of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation after having been kidnapped from [[Denver, Colorado]], and interrogated in [[Rapid City, South Dakota]], as a possible FBI informant. Means implicated Clyde Bellecourt in her murder as well, and other AIM activists, including Theresa Rios. Means said that part of the dissension within AIM in the early 1990s had related to actions to expel the Bellecourt brothers for their part in the Aquash execution; the organization split apart.<ref name=\"Press\">[http://www.indiancountrynews.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=45&Itemid=60 \"Russ Means holds press conference on Annie Mae's murder 11-3-99\"], ''News From Indian Country'', 3 November 1999, accessed 16 July 2011</ref>\n\nEarlier that day in a telephone interview with the journalists Paul DeMain and Harlan McKosato about the upcoming press conference, [[Minnie Two Shoes]] had said, speaking of the importance of Aquash: <blockquote>Part of why she was so important is because she was very symbolic, she was a hard working woman, she dedicated her life to the movement, to righting all the injustices that she could, and to pick somebody out and launch their little cointelpro program on her to bad jacket her to the point where she ends up dead, whoever did it, let's look at what the reasons are, you know, she was killed and lets look at the real reasons why it could have been any of us, it could have been me, it could have been, ya gotta look at the basically thousands of women, you gotta remember that it was mostly women in AIM, it could have been any one of us and I think that's why it's been so important and she was just such a good person.<ref name=\"radio\">[http://www.indiancountrynews.info/nativecalling1.cfm.htm ''Native American Calling''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030232742/http://www.indiancountrynews.info/nativecalling1.cfm.htm |date=2012-10-30 }},  3 November 1999, Native American Public Telecommunications, accessed 16 July 2011</ref></blockquote>\n\nMcKosato said that \"her [Aquash's] death has divided the American Indian Movement\".<ref name=\"radio\"/> On 4 November 1999, in a follow-up show on ''Native American Calling'' the next day, Vernon Bellecourt denied any involvement by him and his brother in the death of Aquash.<ref>[http://www.indiancountrynews.info/nativecalling3.cfm.htm ''Native American Calling''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310021759/http://www.indiancountrynews.info/nativecalling3.cfm.htm |date=2012-03-10 }}, Native American Public Telecommunications, 4 November 1999, at ''News From Indian Country'', accessed 17 July 2011</ref>\n\nAt Federal grand jury hearings in 2003, the Indian men [[Arlo Looking Cloud]] and [[John Graham (Canadian activist)|John Graham]] were indicted for shooting Aquash in December 1975. In February '04, [[Arlo Looking Cloud]] was convicted of murder in Rapid City. He named as the gunman [[John Graham (Canadian activist)|John Graham]], who was in the Yukon. After extradition, [[John Graham (Canadian activist)|John Graham]] was convicted, in 2010 in Rapid City, of the murder. In both trials, hearsay testimony about the motive for the murder included statements that Aquash heard [[Leonard Peltier]] say he killed the FBI agents at [[Incident at Oglala|Oglala]] in June 1975, and fear that Aquash could be working with the FBI. [[Leonard Peltier|Peltier]] was convicted in 1976 of murder for the Oglala killings, on other evidence.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Republic of New Afrika]]\n* [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]]\n* [[Young Lords Party]]\n* [[Black Panther Party]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{cite book|title=Ojibwa warrior: Dennis Banks and the rise of the American Indian Movement|last=Banks|first=Dennis|last2=Erdoes|first2=Richard|date=2004|isbn=978-0806135809|language=English|oclc = 53059503}}\n* {{cite book|title=Custer died for your sins : an Indian manifesto|last=Deloria Jr|first=Vine|date=1988|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0806121291|location=Norman|oclc=17234301}}\n* {{cite AV media |people=Langworthy, Lucas (Director)|date=2010|title=Taking AIM: The Story of the American Indian Movement|trans-title=|medium=DVD|language=|url=|accessdate=|format=|time=|location=|publisher=|id=|isbn=|oclc=|quote=|ref=}}\n* {{cite book|url=http://www.credoreference.com/book/greenwoodim|title=Encyclopedia of the American Indian Movement|last=Johansen|first=Bruce E.|date=2015|isbn=9781785394645|language=English}}\n* {{cite book|title=Red Power: The Native American civil rights movement|last=Johnson|first=Troy R.|date=2007|publisher=Chelsea House|isbn=9780791093412|location=New York|language=English|oclc = 77520605}}\n* {{cite book|title=In the spirit of Crazy Horse|last=Matthiessen|first=Peter|date=1992|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0140144567|location=New York|oclc=25313752|url=https://archive.org/details/inspiritofcrazyh00matt_0}}\n* {{cite book|title=Where white men fear to tread: the autobiography of Russell Means|last=Means|first=Russell|date=1995|publisher=St. Martin's Press|others=Wolf, Marvin J.|isbn=9780312136215|edition=1st|location=New York|oclc=32780115|url=https://archive.org/details/wherewhitemenfea00mean}}\n* {{cite book|title=American Indian ethnic renewal: Red power and the resurgence of identity and culture|last=Nagel|first=Joane|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195080537|location=New York|language=English|oclc = 31610380}}\n* {{cite book|title=Prison writings: my life is my sun dance|last=Peltier|first=Leonard|date=1999|publisher=St. Martin's Press|others=Arden, Harvey.|isbn=978-0312203542|edition=1st|location=New York|oclc=40862180|url=https://archive.org/details/prisonwritings00leon}}\n* {{cite AV media |people=Redford, Robert |date=2004 |title=Incident at Oglala: The Leonard Peltier Story|trans-title=|medium=DVD|language=|url=|accessdate=|format=|time=|location=|publisher=Lions Gate|id=|isbn=|oclc=|quote=|ref=}}\n* {{cite book|title=Loud Hawk: the United States versus the American Indian Movement|last=Stern|first=Kenneth S|date=2002|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=9780806134390|location=Norman, OK|language=English|oclc = 876192514}}\n* {{cite book|last=Weyler|first=Rex|authorlink=Rex Weyler|title=Blood of the Land|publisher=[[Random House]]|series=The Government and Corporate War Against the American Indian Movement|year=1982|isbn=978-0-394-71732-6 }}\n* {{cite book|title=We Are Still Here: A Photographic History of the American Indian Movement|last=Bancroft|first=Dick|last2=Wittstock|first2=Laura Waterman|date=2013|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society Press|isbn=9780873518871|location=St. Paul, Minn|language=English|oclc = 930953303}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|American Indian Movement}}\n* [http://www.aimovement.org/ AIM Grand Governing Council homepage].\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051212091843/http://www.coloradoaim.org/ American Indian Movement of Colorado].\n* [http://www.clevelandaim.us/ Cleveland American Indian Movement] Cleveland AIM is the oldest urban AIM organization and a member of the International Confederation of Autonomous Chapters of AIM.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080511162603/http://www.americanindianmovement.org/index.htm International Confederation of Autonomous chapters of AIM].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n* AIM's [http://www.aimovement.org/moipr/USvAIMbackground.html \"Background on US Government War Against AIM\"]\n* [http://www.dickshovel.com/crimes.html Articles] about AIM. by [[Ward Churchill]] and others.\n* [http://globalvoices.org/2008/07/25/longest-walk-2-for-native-americans-rights-and-environmental-sustainability/ \"USA: Longest Walk 2 for Native Americans rights\"].\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090212221311/http://www.longestwalk.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=33&Itemid=108 \"Longest Walk 1978 Collected Works\"].\n* Jason Heppler, [http://framingredpower.org/ \"Framing Red Power: The American Indian Movement, the Trail of Broken Treaties, and the Politics of Media\"].
