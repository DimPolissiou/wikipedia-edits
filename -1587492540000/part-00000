The case was heard before a judge in Los Angeles, who eventually brokered a deal whereby the case was dismissed upon payment of $25,000 to Stryker and the return and right to reproduce all items which Stryker endorsed.<ref name=Salon/>\n\nStryker has had arguments with Kulak's Woodshed, a folk-music nightclub, that is next door to his office. He claims that the club causes disturbance normally associated with large late-night urban venues: noise, drugs, unruly patrons, vandalism, graffiti, public urination and parking headaches. James Britton, who operates a floor covering business on the other side of the club, also complains that the club has damaged his business. In January 2009, the ''L.A. Weekly'' reported that Stryker blamed the nightclub for preventing him from completing his autobiography, as the noise and crowds disturbed his concentration. \u201c(My writing has) been put on perpetual hold until I can get myself back together,\u201d he told the newspaper. \u201cI got a $25,000 advance on (the book) but could never complete it.\u201d\n\nBut Paul Kulak counter claims (according to the ''L.A. Weekly'') that Stryker has made threats to him and the club's customers: \u201cHe constantly reminds me he\u2019s a firearms expert and will hide behind his back door when I dump the trash. Once, he started making mechanical gun clicks. I could see he had a pistol in his hand as he was dry-firing it... I\u2019m willing to risk my life to keep this [club] going.\u201d Stryker responded to Kulak's claim and was quoted as saying, \"That guy is so out there!\"<ref>Mikulan, Steven.

He claims that the club causes disturbance normally associated with large late-night urban venues: noise, drugs, unruly patrons, vandalism, graffiti, public urination and parking headaches. James Britton, who operates a floor covering business on the other side of the club, also complains that the club has damaged his business. In January 2009, the ''L.A. Weekly'' reported that Stryker blamed the nightclub for preventing him from completing his autobiography, as the noise and crowds disturbed his concentration. \u201c(My writing has) been put on perpetual hold until I can get myself back together,\u201d he told the newspaper. \u201cI got a $25,000 advance on (the book) but could never complete it.\u201d\n\nBut Paul Kulak counter claims (according to the ''L.A. Weekly'') that Stryker has made threats to him and the club's customers: \u201cHe constantly reminds me he\u2019s a firearms expert and will hide behind his back door when I dump the trash. Once, he started making mechanical gun clicks. I could see he had a pistol in his hand as he was dry-firing it... I\u2019m willing to risk my life to keep this [club] going.\u201d Stryker responded to Kulak's claim and was quoted as saying, \"That guy is so out there!\"<ref>Mikulan, Steven.

Bradford opened the scoring early with [[Alan Connell]] before the game evened out a little. Finally in the 73rd minute [[Nahki Wells]] rounded a defender and the keeper to score. This opened the floodgates and [[Ricky Ravenhill]] scored City's 3rd before trial player [[Raffaele De Vita]] scored the goal of the game to finish the scoring.\n\nThe next part of the Bantams pre-season was a tour of Ireland. They started this tour with a 4\u20131 win against [[Athlone Town]]. The Irish opened the scoring as Bradford defender [[James Meredith (footballer)|James Meredith]] scored an own goal in the 23rd minute, however this was short lived as last season's top scorer [[Nahki Wells]] drove a shot into the bottom corner to equalize. The Bantams took the lead 8 minutes later as [[Mark Yeates]] blasted a drive into the other bottom corner, this soon became a 3\u20131 lead to Bradford when [[Raffaele De Vita]]'s cross was bundled into the net by [[Rory McArdle]]. [[Alan Connell]] rounded off the scoring by slotting home a shot to make it 4\u20131. The second game on the Irish tour saw the Bantams face [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]], City once again went behind however this time it wasn't an own goal but rather an opposition player heading the ball in. This 1\u20130 lead was soon rubbed out by an equalizer to [[Garry Thompson (footballer born 1980)|Garry Thompson]] who headed home a [[Jason Kennedy (footballer)|Jason Kennedy]] cross. Just after halftime the Bradford side dominated and this dominance paid off as [[Michael Nelson (footballer)|Michael Nelson]] scored to make it 2\u20131. Youngster [[Louis Swain]] also added a goal before the game was wrapped up by a goal from [[Nahki Wells]] to ensure the Bantams won 4\u20131.\n\nBradford came back to England to face [[Grimsby Town]], it was a hard-fought match and it took the Bantams until the 60th minute to score when [[James Hanson (footballer born 1987)|James Hanson]] tapped in [[Garry Thompson (footballer born 1980)|Garry Thompson]]'s cross. Then [[Mark Yeates]] scored near the full-time whistle as he curled as free-kick into the bottom corner. Bradford won the game 2\u20130 and that meant they were unbeaten in 4 pre-season games. This run came to an end as the Bantams faced [[EFL Championship]] side [[Doncaster Rovers]] at [[Valley Parade]]. The Rovers took the lead in the 23rd minute but Bradford bounced back as [[Garry Thompson (footballer born 1980)|Garry Thompson]] charged down the goalkeepers kick and the ball rolled into the net. However Doncaster scored with 5 minutes to go to ensure that Bradford lost for the first time this pre-season. A young Bradford side lost 2\u20131 to [[Harrogate Town]] in the final pre-season match before facing [[Huddersfield Town]]. Harrogate took the lead after 5 minutes but pressure from the Bantams allowed them to equalize with a [[Nathan Curtis]] goal, however soon after Harrogate took a 2\u20131 lead which they kept hold of despite some good chances from City.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Date\n!Opponents\n!H / A\n!Result<br />F\u2013A\n!Scorers\n!Attendance\n|-bgcolor=#CCFFCC\n|13 July 2013\n|[[Guiseley A.F.C.|Guiseley]]\n|A\n|[http://www.bradfordcityfc.co.uk/news/article/guiseley-vs-bradford-859546.aspx 4\u20130]\n|[[Alan Connell|Connell]] 15', [[Nahki Wells|Wells]] 73', [[Ricky Ravenhill|Ravenhill]] 79', [[Raffaele De Vita|De Vita]] 84'\n| \n|-bgcolor=#CCFFCC\n|16 July 2013\n|[[Athlone Town F.C.|Athlone Town]]\n|A\n|[http://www.bradfordcityfc.co.uk/news/article/athlone-town-vs-bradford-city-919434.aspx 4\u20131]\n|[[Nahki Wells|Wells]] 31', [[Mark Yeates|Yeates]] 38', [[Rory McArdle|McArdle]] 40', [[Alan Connell|Connell]] 82'\n| \n|-bgcolor=#CCFFCC\n|20 July 2013\n|[[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]]\n|A\n|[http://www.bradfordcityfc.co.uk/news/article/bohemians-vs-bradford-city-931519.aspx 4\u20131]\n|[[Garry Thompson (footballer born 1980)|Thompson]] 21', [[Michael Nelson (footballer)|Nelson]] 45+1', [[Louie Swain|Swain]] 48', [[Nahki Wells|Wells]] 78'\n|\n|-bgcolor=#CCFFCC\n|23 July 2013\n|[[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]]\n|A\n|[http://www.bradfordcityfc.co.uk/news/article/grimsby-town-vs-bradford-city-934050.aspx 2\u20130]\n|[[James Hanson (footballer born 1987)|Hanson]] 60', [[Mark Yeates|Yeates]] 86'\n| \n|-bgcolor=#FFCCCC\n|27 July 2013\n|[[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]]\n|H\n|[http://www.bradfordcityfc.co.uk/news/article/bradford-city-vs-doncaster-rovers-948059.aspx 1\u20132]\n|[[Garry Thompson (footballer born 1980)|Thompson]] 55'\n| 2,850\n|-bgcolor=#FFCCCC\n|30 July 2013\n|[[Harrogate Town F.C.|Harrogate Town]]\n|A\n|[http://www.bradfordcityfc.co.uk/news/article/harrogate-town-954020.aspx 1\u20132]\n|[[Nathan Curtis|Curtis]] 36'\n|\n|-bgcolor=#CCFFCC\n|12 August 2013\n|[[Bradford Park Avenue A.F.C.|Bradford Park Avenue]]\n|A\n|[http://www.bradfordcityfc.co.uk/news/article/bradford-park-avenue-vs-bradford-city-august-friendly-986164.aspx 1\u20130]\n|[[Raffaele De Vita|De Vita]] 14' ([[Penalty kick (association football)|pen.]])\n|395\n|}\n\n==League One==\nThe fixtures for the [[2013\u201314 Football League One|2013\u201314 season]] were released on 19 June at 09:00 [[British Summer Time|BST]].\n\nBradford's [[League One]] campaign started with a 2\u20132 draw against [[Bristol City]], after going behind last season's top scorer [[Nahki Wells]] equalized before Bristol scored their second. However [[Rory McArdle]] headed in a cross to make sure the Bantams got a point from the match. The Bantams first home game was a 4\u20130 win against [[Carlisle United]], Bradford raced into a 3\u20130 lead after half an hour with [[Mark Yeates]] scoring a spectacular goal followed by goals from [[Nahki Wells]] and [[James Hanson (footballer born 1987)|James Hanson]] before [[Gary Jones (footballer born 1977)|Gary Jones]] added a second half goal. Bradford's first loss of the season came against [[Port Vale]] as the Bantams went down 2\u20131, their only goal coming from in form striker [[Nahki Wells]]. Bradford bounced back from this defeat with an outstanding 2\u20130 win over Yorkshire rivals [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] with Wells scoring both of the Bantams goals. Bradford's last game of September was a 1\u20131 draw with [[Stevenage]], the Bantams trailed earlier on due to a penalty but just after halftime [[Kyel Reid]] scored to equalize to ensure Bradford came away with a point.\n\nSeptember started great for Bradford as two [[James Hanson (footballer born 1987)|James Hanson]] goals (followed by one each from [[Nahki Wells]] and [[Garry Thompson (footballer born 1980)|Garry Thompson]]) ensured that they came away with a 4\u20130 win against [[Brentford]]. This performance was backed up by a 2\u20132 draw against [[Colchester United]] with [[Nahki Wells]] netting both times. A solitary goal from skipper [[Gary Jones (footballer born 1977)|Gary Jones]] was enough to secure a 1\u20130 win against [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]]. The month ended on a high as Bradford beat [[Shrewsbury Town]] 2-1 thanks to a late 90th-minute winner from [[James Hanson (footballer born 1987)|James Hanson]] after [[Kyel Reid]] had nabbed an equalizer earlier on in the game, this win took the Bantams to 5th place in the league.\n\n===Fixtures===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Date\n!Opponents\n!H/A\n!Result<br

}}</ref>\n\n==Pre-season and friendlies==\nThe Bantams started their pre-season with a 4\u20130 win against [[Guiseley A.F.C.|Guiseley]]. Bradford opened the scoring early with [[Alan Connell]] before the game evened out a little. Finally in the 73rd minute [[Nahki Wells]] rounded a defender and the keeper to score. This opened the floodgates and [[Ricky Ravenhill]] scored City's 3rd before trial player [[Raffaele De Vita]] scored the goal of the game to finish the scoring.\n\nThe next part of the Bantams pre-season was a tour of [[Ireland]]. They started this tour with a 4\u20131 win against [[Athlone Town]]. The Irish opened the scoring as Bradford defender [[James Meredith (footballer)|James Meredith]] scored an own goal in the 23rd minute, however this was short lived as last season's top scorer [[Nahki Wells]] drove a shot into the bottom corner to equalize. The Bantams took the lead 8 minutes later as [[Mark Yeates]] blasted a drive into the other bottom corner, this soon became a 3\u20131 lead to Bradford when [[Raffaele De Vita]]'s cross was bundled into the net by [[Rory McArdle]]. [[Alan Connell]] rounded off the scoring by slotting home a shot to make it 4\u20131. The second game on the Irish tour saw the Bantams face [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]], City once again went behind however this time it wasn't an own goal but rather an opposition player heading the ball in. This 1\u20130 lead was soon rubbed out by an equalizer to [[Garry Thompson (footballer born 1980)|Garry Thompson]] who headed home a [[Jason Kennedy (footballer)|Jason Kennedy]] cross. Just after halftime the Bradford side dominated and this dominance paid off as [[Michael Nelson (footballer)|Michael Nelson]] scored to make it 2\u20131. Youngster [[Louis Swain]] also added a goal before the game was wrapped up by a goal from [[Nahki Wells]] to ensure the Bantams won 4\u20131.\n\nBradford came back to England to face [[Grimsby Town]], it was a hard fought match and it took the Bantams until the 60th minute to score when [[James Hanson (footballer born 1987)|James Hanson]] tapped in [[Garry Thompson (footballer born 1980)|Garry Thompson]]'s cross. Then [[Mark Yeates]] scored near the full-time whistle as he curled as free-kick into the bottom corner. Bradford won the game 2\u20130 and that meant they were unbeaten in 4 pre-season games. This run came to an end as the Bantams faced [[EFL Championship]] side [[Doncaster Rovers]] at [[Valley Parade]]. The Rovers took the lead in the 23rd minute but Bradford bounced back as [[Garry Thompson (footballer born 1980)|Garry Thompson]] charged down the goalkeepers kick and the ball rolled into the net. However Doncaster scored with 5 minutes to go to ensure that Bradford lost for the first time this pre-season. A young Bradford side lost 2\u20131 to [[Harrogate Town]] in the final pre-season match before facing [[Huddersfield Town]]. Harrogate took the lead after 5 minutes but pressure from the Bantams allowed them to equalize with a [[Nathan Curtis]] goal, however soon after Harrogate took a 2\u20131 lead which they kept hold of despite some good chances from City.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Date\n!Opponents\n!H / A\n!Result<br />F\u2013A\n!Scorers\n!Attendance\n|-bgcolor=#CCFFCC\n|13 July 2013\n|[[Guiseley A.F.C.|Guiseley]]\n|A\n|[http://www.bradfordcityfc.co.uk/news/article/guiseley-vs-bradford-859546.aspx 4\u20130]\n|[[Alan Connell|Connell]] 15', [[Nahki Wells|Wells]] 73', [[Ricky Ravenhill|Ravenhill]] 79', [[Raffaele De Vita|De Vita]] 84'\n| \n|-bgcolor=#CCFFCC\n|16 July 2013\n|[[Athlone Town F.C.|Athlone Town]]\n|A\n|[http://www.bradfordcityfc.co.uk/news/article/athlone-town-vs-bradford-city-919434.aspx 4\u20131]\n|[[Nahki Wells|Wells]] 31', [[Mark Yeates|Yeates]] 38', [[Rory McArdle|McArdle]] 40', [[Alan Connell|Connell]] 82'\n| \n|-bgcolor=#CCFFCC\n|20 July 2013\n|[[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemian]]\n|A\n|[http://www.bradfordcityfc.co.uk/news/article/bohemians-vs-bradford-city-931519.aspx 4\u20131]\n|[[Garry Thompson (footballer born 1980)|Thompson]] 21', [[Michael Nelson (footballer)|Nelson]] 45+1', [[Louie Swain|Swain]] 48', [[Nahki Wells|Wells]] 78'\n|\n|-bgcolor=#CCFFCC\n|23 July 2013\n|[[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]]\n|A\n|[http://www.bradfordcityfc.co.uk/news/article/grimsby-town-vs-bradford-city-934050.aspx 2\u20130]\n|[[James Hanson (footballer born 1987)|Hanson]] 60', [[Mark Yeates|Yeates]] 86'\n| \n|-bgcolor=#FFCCCC\n|27 July 2013\n|[[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]]\n|H\n|[http://www.bradfordcityfc.co.uk/news/article/bradford-city-vs-doncaster-rovers-948059.aspx 1\u20132]\n|[[Garry Thompson (footballer born 1980)|Thompson]] 55'\n| 2,850\n|-bgcolor=#FFCCCC\n|30 July 2013\n|[[Harrogate Town F.C.|Harrogate Town]]\n|A\n|[http://www.bradfordcityfc.co.uk/news/article/harrogate-town-954020.aspx 1\u20132]\n|[[Nathan Curtis|Curtis]] 36'\n|\n|-bgcolor=#CCFFCC\n|12 August 2013\n|[[Bradford Park Avenue A.F.C.|Bradford Park Avenue]]\n|A\n|[http://www.bradfordcityfc.co.uk/news/article/bradford-park-avenue-vs-bradford-city-august-friendly-986164.aspx 1\u20130]\n|[[Raffaele De Vita|De Vita]] 14' ([[Penalty kick (association football)|pen.]])\n|395\n|}\n\n==League One==\nThe fixtures for the [[2013\u201314 Football League One|2013\u201314 season]] were released on 19 June at 09:00 [[British Summer Time|BST]].\n\nBradford's [[League One]] campaign started with a 2\u20132 draw against [[Bristol City]], after going behind last season's top scorer [[Nahki Wells]] equalized before Bristol scored their second. However [[Rory McArdle]] headed in a cross to make sure the Bantams got a point from the match. The Bantams first home game was a 4-0 win against [[Carlisle United]], Bradford raced into a 3-0 lead after half an hour with [[Mark Yeates]] scoring a spectacular goal followed by goals from [[Nahki Wells]] and [[James Hanson (footballer born 1987)|James Hanson]] before [[Gary Jones (footballer born 1977)|Gary Jones]] added a second half goal. Bradford's first loss of the season came against [[Port Vale]] as the Bantams went down 2-1, their only goal coming from in form striker [[Nahki Wells]]. Bradford bounced back from this defeat with an outstanding 2-0 win over Yorkshire rivals [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] with Wells scoring both of the Bantams goals. Bradford's last game of September was a 1-1 draw with [[Stevenage]], the Bantams trailed earlier on due to a penalty but just after halftime [[Kyel Reid]] scored to equalize to ensure Bradford came away with a point.\n\nSeptember started great for Bradford as two [[James Hanson (footballer born 1987)|James Hanson]] goals (followed by one each from [[Nahki Wells]] and [[Garry Thompson (footballer born 1980)|Garry Thompson]]) ensured that they came away with a 4-0 win against [[Brentford]]. This performance was backed up by a 2-2 draw against [[Colchester United]] with [[Nahki Wells]] netting both times. A solitary goal from skipper [[Gary Jones (footballer born 1977)|Gary Jones]] was enough to secure a 1-0 win against [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]]. The month ended on a high as Bradford beat [[Shrewsbury Town]] 2-1 thanks to a late 90th-minute winner from [[James Hanson (footballer born 1987)|James Hanson]] after [[Kyel Reid]] had nabbed an equalizer earlier on in the game, this win took the Bantams to 5th place in the league.\n\n===Fixtures===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Date\n!Opponents\n!H/A\n!Result<br

The operation of these facilities, or the [[departmentalization|department]] of an organization which does so, is called \"plant operations\" or [[facility management]]. Industrial plant should not be confused with \"manufacturing plant\" in the [[word sense|sense]] of \"a [[factory]]\".\n\n==HVAC==\n[[HVAC]] plant usually includes [[air conditioning]] (both [[heating]] and [[refrigeration|cooling]] systems and [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]]) and other mechanical systems. It often also includes the maintenance of other systems, such as [[plumbing]] and [[lighting]]. The facility itself may be an [[office building]], a [[school]] [[campus]], [[military base]], [[apartment complex]], or the like.\n\n==Electric Loads==\n===Synchronized Loads===\n====Phase Voltage Unbalance and AC Motors====\nA Voltage Unbalance is also called a Phase Imbalance. Some motor manufacturers require less than 5% current unbalance. In some 800 HP motors in 1,500 ton chillers the digital chillers controls stop the motor upon a 2% Voltage Unbalance.<ref>[https://library.e.abb.com/public/0c4186f3e7354f6982124decf92742d8/AVC-20%20white%20paper%20(low%20res).pdf ABB | Unbalanced voltage supply, The damaging effects on three phase induction motors and rectifiers |  An imbalance greater than 2% is unacceptable]</ref>,<ref>[https://www.pge.com/includes/docs/pdfs/mybusiness/customerservice/energystatus/powerquality/voltage_unbalance_rev2.pdf Pacific Gas & Electric, PG&E | Voltage Unbalance and Motors ]</ref> Electric motors tend to trip manual overload safety relays with +4% Voltage Unbalance. The digital controls on modern Air compressors can be set to automatically stop after a 2% Voltage Unbalance<ref>[https://www.fpl.com/partner/pdf/electric-service-standards-motors.pdf Florida Power & Light Company | Electric Service Standards | Page 3]</ref>. The compressors are to remain stopped until after clean electrical power is restored for a minimum time, say 36 seconds; with the each additional compressor staged at 6 second or longer intervals. By automatically stopping upon low voltage and voltage unbalance, one avoids the unwanted tripping of the overload relays, which require a person to manually reset. It also prevents the digital controls from restarting all of the air compressors at the same exact time, which can trip 1,200 amp main breakers.<ref>[https://www.ecmweb.com/content/basics-voltage-imbalance EC&M | phase-motor-voltage-unbalance]</ref><ref>[https://www.achrnews.com/articles/93649-three-phase-motor-voltage-unbalance ACHR News | Three-Phase Motor Voltage Unbalance]</ref> After market digital programmable three-phase line voltage monitor controllers are available.<ref>https://www.icmcontrols.com/productdetails/ICM450 ICM | Three Phase Monitor, Motor Protection</ref>\n\n==Dialysis Units==\nSynchronized Loads such as a set of 15 individual dialysis units with 115 VAC 12 amp loads operating with digital controllers had tripped the 150 Amp main breaker. The digital controllers switch the heaters ON and OFF at 20 Hz, so that the heater effectively operates at 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, etc. However, when there is a blink on the electrical power grid, then all 15 units synchronize and can trip OFF the power to all 15 units.\n\n==Broadcast engineering==\nIn [[broadcast engineering]], the term '''transmitter plant''' is the part of the physical plant associated with the [[transmitter]] and its controls and inputs, the [[studio/transmitter link]] (if the [[radio studio]] is off-site),<ref>http://www.richsamuels.com/nbcmm/wmaq/early_wmaq/elmhurst_antenna_1928.html</ref> the [[radio antenna]] and [[radome]]s, [[feedline]] and [[desiccation]]/[[nitrogen]] system, [[broadcast tower]] and [[quonset hut|building]], tower lighting, [[Electrical generator|generator]], and air conditioning.

Between 1919 and 1927 Waddington made 255 appearances for Yorkshire, and in all [[first-class cricket]] played 266 matches. In these games, he took a total of 852 [[Wicket#Dismissing a batsman|wickets]] with his left arm [[Fast bowling#Categorisation of fast bowling|fast-medium]] bowling. Capable of making the ball [[Swing bowling|swing]], Waddington was admired for the aesthetic quality of his [[bowling action]]. He was a hostile bowler who sometimes [[Sledging (cricket)|sledged]] opposing batsmen and questioned umpires' decisions, behaviour which was unusual during his playing days.\n\nWaddington first played for Yorkshire after the First World War, when the team had been weakened by injuries and retirements. He made an immediate impression in 1919, his first season; he took 100 wickets and was largely responsible for Yorkshire's victory in the [[County Championship]] that year. After a similarly successful season in 1920, he was selected for the 1920\u201321 [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) tour of Australia, during which he appeared in two of the five Tests. However, the England team were outclassed; used in an unfamiliar tactical role, Waddington took just one wicket and never played for England again. He continued to be effective for Yorkshire, particularly against the weaker counties, but was often inconsistent. His reputation as an uncompromising opponent was cemented when he was found guilty of dissent and inciting the crowd in a game against [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]].

Between 1919 and 1927 Waddington made 255 appearances for Yorkshire, and in all [[first-class cricket]] played 266 matches. In these games, he took a total of 852 [[Wicket#Dismissing a batsman|wickets]] with his left arm [[Fast bowling#Categorisation of fast bowling|fast-medium]] bowling. Capable of making the ball [[Swing bowling|swing]], Waddington was admired for the aesthetic quality of his [[bowling action]]. He was a hostile bowler who sometimes [[Sledging (cricket)|sledged]] opposing batsmen and questioned umpires' decisions, behaviour which was unusual during his playing days.\n\nWaddington first played for Yorkshire after the First World War, when the team had been weakened by injuries and retirements. He made an immediate impression in 1919, his first season; he took 100 wickets and was largely responsible for Yorkshire's victory in the [[County Championship]] that year. After a similarly successful season in 1920, he was selected for the 1920\u201321 [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) tour of Australia, during which he appeared in two of the five Tests. However, the England team were outclassed; used in an unfamiliar tactical role, Waddington took just one wicket and never played for England again. He continued to be effective for Yorkshire, particularly against the weaker counties, but was often inconsistent. His reputation as an uncompromising opponent was cemented when he was found guilty of dissent and inciting the crowd in a game against [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]]. A succession of injuries reduced his effectiveness and he retired from first-class cricket in 1927. He continued to play league cricket and worked for the family business, a fat-refining firm, but maintained his connection with Yorkshire cricket.\n\nIn the early 1920s, Waddington played several football matches for [[Halifax Town A.F.C.|Halifax Town]] as a goalkeeper, and after his retirement from cricket enjoyed some success as an amateur golfer. He was in trouble with the police on more than one occasion and after the Second World War was charged with defrauding his wartime employers, the [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Food]]; he was found not guilty. He died in 1959 at the age of 66.\n\n==Early life==\nAbraham Waddington{{refn|Waddington's first name is variously given as Abraham or Abram.
