This report highlights health conditions and physical limitations experienced by burn pit registry participants.\n*The most common doctor-diagnosed health problems reported were insomnia and neurological problems.\n*Other commonly diagnosed health problems reported include allergies, high blood pressure, and lung disease like emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and asthma.\n*It is important to remember that Registry findings alone can't tell if exposure to burn pits, dust storms, or other hazards caused these health conditions.\n2. [http://www.publichealth.va.gov/docs/exposures/va-ahobp-registry-data-report-april2015.pdf Report on Data from the Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit (AH&OBP) Registry, April 2015]\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, 186,051 veterans and active duty members have completed the questionnaire since June 2014.\n\n===Proposed Health Tracking===\nUS Army veteran and University of Pennsylvania graduate student, Chad Baer, has vocally asserted that claims of inclusive results are due to faulty research design. Baer was selected as a SVA/VFW Legislative Fellow in 2019, and traveled to Capitol Hill to advocate for a [[predictive analytics]] model. Baer has asserted that technological advances have made longitudinal studies of all veterans feasible, except that this is not possible so long as the Department of Defense refuses to give VA researchers more complete data. The data in question would be the personnel data that would allow the VA to establish \"clusters\", based on items such as physical location, job specialties, or other relevant data points.<ref>https://www.vfw.org/media-and-events/latest-releases/archives/2019/1/vfw-and-sva-announce-2019-student-veteran-fellowship-class</ref>\n<ref>https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/investigations/burn-pits-congress-veterans-administration-healthcare-507164361.html</ref>\n<ref>https://www.thedp.com/article/2019/02/penn-chad-baer-veteran-health-illness-system-graduate-student</ref>\n\n=== Legislative Response ===\nA Minnesota mother, Amie Muller, was a victim of the exposure and her senator, [[Amy Klobuchar]] (MN-DFL), carried a bill called the \u201cHelping Vets Exposed to Burn Pits Act\u201d<ref>https://www.pinecountycourier.com/single-post/2017/11/11/A-courageous-battle-on-the-homefront</ref> that was passed and signed into law by President [[Donald Trump]] (as H.R. 5895) on September 21, 2018.<ref>https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-signs-h-r-5895-law/</ref>  Through 2019, it will provide $5 million for burn pit research, education and evaluation of the exposure of other U.S. service members and veterans to burn pits and toxic airborne chemicals.<ref>http://bigislandnow.com/2018/09/14/bill-to-fund-military-veterans-clean-energy-programs-passes/</ref>\n\nCongressional Action\n\n* 2009 - HR 2419, ''Military Personnel War Zone Toxic Exposure Prevention Act''\n*2013 - President Obama signed National Burn Pit Registry into law as part of the ''Dignified Burial and Veterans' Benefit Improvement Act of 2012''\n*2018 - President Trump signed ''Helping Vets Exposed to Burn Pits Act.''\n*\n* \n\n<br />\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n**[http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/burnpits/registry.asp Department of Veterans Affairs, Public Health, VA's Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry webpage]\n**[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-pddv4wBkE VA Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry Video]\n**[https://web.archive.org/web/20090416051040/http://www.militarytimes.com/news/2008/10/military_toxiciraq_100208w/ \"Report: Army making toxic mess in war zones\"] article by Kelly Kennedy in ''[[Military Times]]'' Oct 3, 2008\n**David E.

As with many of these volunteers, initially, there were not enough [[Springfield Model 1861|Model 1861 Springfield Rifles]] to go around so they were instead issued imported [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|British Pattern 1853 rifles]]. These were the standard rifle for the British army having performed well in the [[Crimean War]]. The Enfield was a was a .577 calibre [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Mini\u00e9-type]] muzzle-loading [[rifled musket]]. It was used by both armies and was the second most widely used infantry weapon in the Union forces.\n\nAt Gettysburg, on the evening of 3 July, General Birney wanted to standardize the weapons in his division<ref name=\"Houghton\" />. That evening, he had the 17th and other Enfield-equipped units in his command exchange their arms for the standard muzzle-loading rifled musket of the Union Army, the [[Springfield Model 1861]] Rifled Musket. It fired a .58 inch [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Minie Ball.]] and came with a square socket bayonet. They would carry their Springfields until their end of service.\n\n==Casualties and total strength==\nThe 17th Maine enrolled 1,371 men during its existence.<ref>http://www.state.me.us/sos/arc/archives/military/civilwar/17meinf.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230092433/http://www.state.me.us/sos/arc/archives/military/civilwar/17meinf.htm |date=2006-12-30 }} State of Maine Civil War Records Website</ref> It lost 12 officers and 116 enlisted men killed in action or died of wounds received in battle and an additional 4 officers and 159 enlisted men died of disease.<ref>http://www.civilwararchive.com/Unreghst/unmeinf1.htm Civil War Archive Website, after Dyer</ref>  31 men died in Confederate prisons.

The Enfield was a was a .577 calibre [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Mini\u00e9-type]] muzzle-loading [[rifled musket]]. It was used by both armies and was the second most widely used infantry weapon in the Union forces.\n\nAt Gettysburg, on the evening of 3 July, General Birney wanted to standardize the weapons in his division<ref name=\"Houghton\" />. That evening, he had the 17th and other Enfield-equipped units in his command exchange their arms for the standard muzzle-loading rifled musket of the Union Army, the [[Springfield Model 1861]] Rifled Musket. It fired a .58 inch [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Minie Ball.]] and came with a square socket bayonet.

His father, Rafael Maria D\u00edaz, and his mother, Elvira Maestre, were poor. His childhood was spent helping his parents and eight brothers with farm duties, while he was musically influenced by his locally renowned uncle, Martin Elias. His friends nicknamed him \"El Chivato\" (\"the little goat\"), making fun of his young vibrating voice. Eventually an uncle decided to help him train his voice and compose songs; Diomedes mastered his vocal training and was invited to perform at parties. He moved to [[Valledupar]] to work as a [[gardener]], and also worked as a messenger and office boy for local radio station Radio Guatapuri. Between 1974 and 1975, he got his first recording deal with Jorge Quir\u00f3z and Luciano Poveda, a vallenato group. They recorded the song \"La Negra and Cantor Campesino\", which won D\u00edaz fame. He also composed the song \"Cari\u00f1ito de Mi Vida\" which was sung by his school friend and upcoming Vallenato singer Rafael Orozco.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n[[Image:Diomdesfans.png|thumb|right|300px|Diomedes D\u00edaz being paraded on the streets of Valledupar after the release of one of his albums.]]\nD\u00edaz received invitations to more parties, gigs and reunions, and his voice captivated a new generation of fans. At the cultural week for a local high school, he met [[Rafael Orozco Maestre]], an emerging vallenato singer who would give D\u00edaz his famous nickname ''El Cacique de La Junta''. After saving money, he recorded his first [[Gramophone record|LP]], with accordionist Nafer Dur\u00e1n, which was played on radio stations and catapulted D\u00edaz to regional fame. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n==Death==\nD\u00edaz died 22 December 2013 of a heart attack at age 56.

His father, Rafael Maria D\u00edaz, and his mother, Elvira Maestre, were poor. His childhood was spent helping his parents and eight brothers with farm duties, while he was musically influenced by his locally renowned uncle, Martin Elias. His friends nicknamed him \"El Chivato\" (\"the little goat\"), making fun of his young vibrating voice. Eventually an uncle decided to help him train his voice and compose songs; Diomedes mastered his vocal training and was invited to perform at parties. He moved to [[Valledupar]] to work as a [[gardener]], and also worked as a messenger and office boy for local radio station Radio Guatapuri. Between 1974 and 1975, he got his first recording deal with Jorge Quir\u00f3z and Luciano Poveda, a vallenato group. They recorded the song \"La Negra and Cantor Campesino\", which won D\u00edaz fame. He also composed the song \"Cari\u00f1ito de Mi Vida\" which was sung by his school friend and upcoming Vallenato singer Rafael Orozco.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n[[Image:Diomdesfans.png|thumb|right|300px|Diomedes D\u00edaz being paraded on the streets of Valledupar after the release of one of his albums.]]\nD\u00edaz received invitations to more parties, gigs and reunions, and his voice captivated a new generation of fans. At the cultural week for a local high school, he met [[Rafael Orozco Maestre]], an emerging vallenato singer who would give D\u00edaz his famous nickname ''El Cacique de La Junta''. After saving money, he recorded his first [[Gramophone record|LP]], with accordionist Nafer Dur\u00e1n, which was played on radio stations and catapulted D\u00edaz to regional fame. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n==Death==\nD\u00edaz died 22 December 2013 of a heart attack at age 56.

The Colombian Bureau of Legal Medicine determined that she had died from pressure put over her mouth and nose.

According to the trial, D\u00edaz did not commit unintentional homicide (''homicidio preterintencional''), in which the aggressor wants to induce damage but ends up causing death, as the previous judge had ruled.

The novel's title echoes the component parts of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', which is a series of connected stories (\"The Merchant's Tale\", \"The Parson's Tale\", etc.).<ref name=\"The New York Times\">{{cite news|last1=Atwood|first1=Margaret|title=Margaret Atwood on What 'The Handmaid's Tale' Means in the Age of Trump|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/books/review/margaret-atwood-handmaids-tale-age-of-trump.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur|accessdate=11 March 2017|work=The New York Times|date=10 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n''The Handmaid's Tale'' is structured into two parts, by night and by other various events. This novel can be interpreted as a double narrative, Offred's tale and the handmaids' tales. The night sections are solely about Offred, and the other sections (shopping, waiting room, household, etc.) are the stories that describe the possible life of every handmaid, though from the perspective of Offred. In many of these sections, Offred jumps between past and present as she retells the events leading up to the fall of women's rights and the current details of the life that she now lives.\n\n''The Handmaid's Tale'' won the 1985 [[Governor General's Award]] and the first [[Arthur C. Clarke Award]] in 1987; it was also nominated for the 1986 [[Nebula Award]], the 1986 [[Man Booker Prize|Booker Prize]], and the 1987 [[Prometheus Award]]. The book has been adapted into a [[The Handmaid's Tale (film)|1990 film]], a [[The Handmaid's Tale (opera)|2000 opera]], [[The Handmaid's Tale (TV series)|a 2017 television series]], and other media.\n\nIn 2019, a sequel novel, ''[[The Testaments]]'', was published.\n\n==Plot summary==\nAfter a staged attack that killed the [[President of the United States]] and most of [[United States Congress|Congress]], a radical political group called the \"Sons of Jacob\" used quasi-Christian ideology to launch a [[Second American Revolution|revolution]]. The [[United States Constitution]] was suspended, newspapers were censored, and what was formerly the United States of America was changed into a [[military dictatorship]] resembling a [[theonomy]], known as the Republic of [[Gilead]].<ref name=\"Douthat2017\"/> The new regime moved quickly to consolidate its power, overtaking all other religious groups, including traditional Christian denominations. In addition, the regime reorganized society using a peculiar interpretation of some [[Old Testament]] ideas, and a new militarized, hierarchical model of social and [[religious fanaticism]] among its newly created social classes. Above all, the biggest change is the severe limitation of people's rights, especially those of women, who are not allowed to read, write, own property or handle money. Most significantly, women are deprived of control over their own reproductive functions.\n\nThe story is told in first-person narration by a woman named Offred. In this era of declining birth rates due to increasing infertility caused by environmental pollution and radiation, she is one of few fertile women remaining. Therefore, she is forcibly assigned to produce children for the \"Commanders\", the ruling class of men, and is known as a \"Handmaid\" based on the biblical story of [[Rachel]] and her handmaid [[Bilhah]]. Apart from Handmaids, other women are also classed socially and follow a strict dress code, ranked highest to lowest: the Commanders' Wives in blue, the Handmaids in red with white veils around their faces, the Aunts (who train and indoctrinate the Handmaids) in brown, the Marthas (cooks and maids) in green, \"Econowives\" who handle everything in the domestic sphere in stripes, young, unmarried girls in white, and widows in black.\n\nOffred details her life starting with her third assignment as a Handmaid to a Commander. Interspersed with her narratives of her present-day experiences are flashbacks  of her life before and during the beginning of the revolution, when she finds she has lost all autonomy to her husband, their failed attempt to escape to Canada, her indoctrination into life as a Handmaid by the government-trained Aunts, and the successful escape of her friend Moira. At her new home, she is treated poorly by a woman called Serena Joy, the Commander's wife and a former Christian media personality, who supported women's domesticity and subordinate role well before Gilead was established. To Offred's surprise, the Commander requests to see her outside of the \"Ceremony\", a sexual ritual obligatory for handmaids and intended to result in conception in the presence of his wife. The two begin an illegal relationship where they play [[Scrabble]] and Offred is allowed to ask favours of him, whether in terms of information or material items. Finally, he gives her lingerie and takes her to a government-run [[brothel]] called Jezebel's meant to add variety to men's sex lives, which (as claimed by the Commander) is necessary. Offred unexpectedly encounters Moira there, with her will broken, and she learns that those who are found breaking the law are sent to the Colonies to clean up toxic waste or are allowed to work at Jezebel's as punishment.\n\nIn the days between her visits to the Commander, Offred also learns from her shopping partner, a woman called Ofglen, of the Mayday resistance, an underground network working to overthrow the Republic of Gilead. Not knowing of Offred's criminal acts with her husband, Serena begins to suspect that the Commander is infertile, and arranges for Offred to begin a covert sexual relationship with Nick, the Commander's personal servant. After their initial sexual encounter, Offred and Nick begin to meet on their own initiative as well, with Offred discovering that she enjoys these intimate moments despite memories of her husband, and shares potentially dangerous information about her past with him. However, shortly after, Ofglen disappears (reported as a suicide), and Serena finds evidence of the relationship between Offred and the Commander, which causes Offred to contemplate suicide.\n\nOffred tells Nick that she thinks she is pregnant. Shortly afterward, men arrive at the house wearing the uniform of the secret police, the Eyes of God, known informally as \"the Eyes\", to take her away. As she is led to a waiting van, Nick tells her to trust him and go with the men. It is unclear whether the men are actually Eyes, or members of the Mayday resistance, an underground network to overthrow the Republic of Gilead. Offred is still unsure if Nick is a member of Mayday or an Eye posing as one, and does not know if leaving will result in her escape or her capture. Ultimately, she enters the van with her future uncertain.\n\nThe novel concludes with a [[metafictional]] [[epilogue]], described as a partial transcript of an international historical association conference taking place in the year 2195. The keynote speaker explains that Offred's account of the events of the novel was recorded onto cassette tapes later found and transcribed by historians studying what is then called \"the Gilead Period.\" It is implied that, following the collapse of the theonomic Republic of Gilead, a more equal society re-emerged with a restoration of normal rights for women and freedom of religion.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Callaway|first=Alanna|date=|title=Women disunited : Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale as a critique of feminism|url=https://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=4501&context=etd_theses|journal=San Jose State University SJSU ScholarWorks|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> However, the future setting still presents some issues regarding attitudes towards women, as seen when Professor Peixoto makes a sexist joke about Professor Maryann Crescent Moon, causing laughter from the audience, and highlighting his ignorance toward the situation.\n\n== Background ==\nFitting with her claims that ''The Handmaid's Tale'' is a work of speculative fiction, not science fiction, Atwood's novel offers a satirical view of various social, political, and religious trends of the United States in the 1980s. Her motivation for writing the novel was that in the 1980s, the religious right was discussing what they would do with/to women if they took power, including the [[Moral Majority]], [[Focus on the Family]], the [[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]] and the Ronald Reagan administration.<ref name=\":1\" /> Further, Atwood questions what would happen if these trends, and especially \"casually held attitudes about women\" were taken to their logical end.<ref name=\":11\" /> Atwood continues to argue that all of the scenarios offered in The Handmaid's Tale have actually occurred in real life\u2014in an interview she gave regarding Oryx and Crake, Atwood maintains that \"As with The Handmaid's Tale, I didn't put in anything that we haven't already done, we're not already doing, we're seriously trying to do, coupled with trends that are already in progress... So all of those things are real, and therefore the amount of pure invention is close to nil.\"<ref name=\":12\" /> Atwood was also known to carry around newspaper clippings to her various interviews to support her fiction's basis in reality.<ref name=\":22\"/> Atwood has explained that The Handmaid's Tale is a response to those who claim the oppressive, totalitarian, and religious governments that have taken hold in other countries throughout the years \"can't happen here\"\u2014but in this work, she has tried to show how such a takeover might play out.<ref name=\":42\"/>\n\nAtwood's inspiration for the Republic of Gilead came from her time studying early American Puritans while at Harvard, which she attended on a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship.<ref name=\":11\" /> Atwood argues that the modern view of the Puritans\u2014that they came to America to flee religious persecution in England and set up a religiously tolerant society\u2014is misleading, and that instead, these Puritan leaders wanted to establish a monolithic theocracy where religious dissent would not be tolerated.<ref name=\":11\" /> Atwood also had a personal connection to the Puritans, and she dedicates the novel to her own ancestor Mary Webster, who was accused of witchcraft in Puritan New England but survived her hanging.<ref name=\":13\" /> Due to the totalitarian nature of Gileadan society, Atwood, in creating the setting, drew from the \"utopian idealism\" present in 20th century r\u00e9gimes, such as Cambodia and Romania, as well as earlier New England Puritanism.<ref name=\":32\"/> Atwood has argued that a coup, such as the one depicted in The Handmaid's Tale, would misuse religion in order to achieve its own ends:.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":32\" />\n\nAtwood, with respect to those leading Gilead, further stated:<ref name=\"Williams2017\" /><blockquote>I don't consider these people to be Christians because they do not have at the core of their behavior and ideologies what I, in my feeble Canadian way, would consider to be the core of Christianity \u2026 and that would be not only love your neighbors but love your enemies. That would also be 'I was sick and you visited me not' and such and such \u2026And that would include also concern for the environment, because you can't love your neighbor or even your enemy, unless you love your neighbor's oxygen, food, and water. You can't love your neighbor or your enemy if you're presuming policies that are going to cause those people to die. \u2026 Of course faith can be a force for good and often has been. So faith is a force for good particularly when people are feeling beleaguered and in need of hope. So you can have bad iterations and you can also have the iteration in which people have got too much power and then start abusing it. But that is human behavior, so you can't lay it down to religion. You can find the same in any power situation, such as politics or ideologies that purport to be atheist. Need I mention the former Soviet Union? So it is not a question of religion making people behave badly. It is a question of human beings getting power and then wanting more of it.</blockquote>In the same vein, Atwood also declared that \"In the real world today, some religious groups are leading movements for the protection of vulnerable groups, including women.\"<ref name=\"The New York Times\" /> Atwood also draws connections between the ways in which Gilead's leaders maintain their power and other examples of actual totalitarian governments. In her interviews, Atwood offers up Afghanistan as an example of a religious theocracy forcing women out of the public sphere and into their homes, as in Gilead.<ref name=\":22\"/><ref name=\":11\" /> The \"state-sanctioned murder of dissidents\" was inspired by the Philippines, and the last General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu's obsession with increasing the birth rate led to the strict policing of pregnant women and the outlawing of birth control and abortion.<ref name=\":22\"/> However, Atwood clearly explains that many of these deplorable acts were not just present in other cultures and countries, \"but within Western society, and within the 'Christian' tradition itself\".<ref name=\":32\"/>\n\nThe Republic of Gilead struggles with infertility, making Offred's services as a Handmaid vital to producing children and thus reproducing the society. Handmaids themselves are \"untouchable\", but their ability to signify status is equated to that of slaves or servants throughout history.<ref name=\":32\"/> Atwood connects their concerns with infertility to real-life problems our world faces, such as radiation, chemical pollution, and venereal disease (HIV/AIDS is specifically mentioned in the \"Historical Notes\" section at the end of the novel, which was a relatively new disease at the time of Atwood's writing whose long-term impact was still unknown). Atwood's strong stance on environmental issues and their negative consequences for our society has presented itself in other works such as her MaddAddam trilogy, and refers back to her growing up with biologists and her own scientific curiosity.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Offred===\nOffred is the [[protagonist]] and [[narrator]] who takes the readers through life in Gilead. She was labeled a \"wanton woman\" when Gilead was established because she had married a man who was divorced. All divorces were nullified by the new government, meaning her husband was now considered still married to his first wife, making Offred an adulteress. In trying to escape Gilead, she was separated from her husband and daughter. She is part of the first generation of Gilead's women, those who remember pre-Gilead times. Proved fertile, she is considered an important commodity and has been placed as a \"handmaid\" in the home of \"the Commander\" and his wife Serena Joy, to bear a child for them (Serena Joy is believed to be infertile).<ref name=\"GradesaverCharList\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gradesaver.com/the-handmaids-tale/study-guide/character-list/ | title = The Handmaid's Tale Study Guide: Character List | publisher = Gradesaver | date = 22 May 2009}}<!--Some of the information in the sec. on Characters below and other sections of this Wikipedia article may have been taken from this or a similar secondary source.

In the novel, Offred says that she is ''not'' a concubine, but a tool; a \"two legged womb\". The Handmaids' names say nothing about who the women really are; their only identity is as the Commander's property. \"Offred\" is also a pun on the word \"offered\", as in \"offered as a sacrifice\", and \"of red\" because the red dress assigned for the handmaids in Gilead.\n\nIn Atwood's original novel, Offred's real name is never revealed; however, [[Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff]]'s 1990 film adaptation gave Offred the real name Kate,<ref>[https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/03/the-forgotten-handmaids-tale/388514/ \"The Forgotten Handmaid's Tale\"].

The names are \"Alma. Janine. Dolores. Moira. June,\" and all are later accounted for except June. In addition, one of the Aunts tells the handmaids-in-training to stop \"mooning and June-ing\".{{Sfn | Atwood | 1986 | p = 220}} From this and other references, some readers have inferred that her birth name could be \"June\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Offred's Real Name In 'The Handmaid's Tale' Is The Only Piece Of Power She Still Holds |first=Dana |last=Getz |work=[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]] |date=April 26, 2017 |quote=In Margaret Atwood's original novel, Offred's real name is never revealed.

Later, it is hypothesized, but not confirmed, that he might have been one of the architects of the Republic and its laws. Presumably, his first name is \"Fred\", though that, too, may be a pseudonym. He engages in forbidden intellectual pursuits with Offred, such as playing [[Scrabble]], and introduces her to a secret club that serves as a brothel for high-ranking officers. Offred learns that the Commander carried on a similar relationship with his previous handmaid, who later killed herself when his wife found out.\n\nIn the epilogue, Professor Peixoto speculates that one of two figures, both instrumental in the establishment of Gilead, may have been the Commander, based on the name \"Fred\". It is his belief that the Commander was a man named Frederick R. Waterford who was killed in a purge shortly after Offred was taken away, charged with harbouring an enemy agent.\n\n===Serena Joy===\nSerena Joy is a former [[televangelist]] and the Commander's wife in the fundamentalist theonomy. The state took away her power and public recognition, and tries to hide her past as a television figure. Offred identifies Serena Joy by recalling seeing her on TV when she was a little girl early on Saturday mornings while waiting for the cartoons to air. Believed to be sterile (although the suggestion is made that the Commander is sterile, Gileadean laws attribute sterility only to women), she is forced to accept that he has use of a handmaid. She resents having to take part in \"The Ceremony\", a monthly fertility ritual. She strikes a deal with Offred to arrange for her to have sex with Nick in order to become pregnant. According to Professor Pieixoto in the epilogue, \"Serena Joy\" or \"Pam\" are pseudonyms; the character's real name is implied to be Thelma.\n\n===Ofglen===\nOfglen is a neighbour of Offred's and a fellow Handmaid. She is partnered with Offred to do the daily shopping. Handmaids are never alone and are expected to police each other's behaviour. Ofglen is a member of the Mayday resistance. In contrast to Offred, she is daring. She knocks out a Mayday spy who is to be tortured and killed in order to save him the pain of a violent death. Offred is told that when Ofglen vanishes, it is because she has committed suicide before the government can take her into custody due to her membership in the resistance, possibly to avoid giving away any information.\n\nA new handmaid, also called Ofglen, takes Ofglen's place, and is assigned as Offred's shopping partner. She threatens Offred against any thought of resistance. In addition, she breaks protocol by telling her what happened to the first Ofglen.\n\n===Nick===\nNick is the Commander's chauffeur, who lives above the garage. By Serena Joy's arrangement, he and Offred start a sexual relationship to increase her chance of getting pregnant. If she were unable to bear the Commander a child, she would be declared sterile and shipped to the ecological wastelands of the Colonies. Offred begins to develop feelings for him. Nick is an ambiguous character, and Offred does not know if he is a party loyalist or part of the resistance, though he identifies himself as the latter. The epilogue suggests that he really was part of the resistance, and aided Offred in escaping the Commander's house.\n\n===Moira===\nMoira has been a close friend of Offred's since college. In the novel, their relationship represents a female friendship that the Republic of Gilead tries to block. A lesbian, she has resisted the [[homophobia]] of Gilead society. Moira is taken to be a Handmaid soon after Offred. She escapes by stealing an Aunt's pass and clothes, but Offred later finds her working as a prostitute in a party-run brothel. She was caught and chose the brothel rather than to be sent to the Colonies. Moira exemplifies defiance against Gilead by rejecting every value that is forced onto the citizens.\n\n===Luke===\nLuke was Offred's husband before the formation of Gilead, having divorced his first wife to marry her. Under Gilead, all divorces were retroactively nullified, resulting in Offred being considered an adulteress and their daughter [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]]. Offred was forced to become a Handmaid and her daughter was given to a loyalist family. Since their attempt to escape to Canada, Offred has heard nothing of Luke. She wavers between believing him dead or imprisoned.\n\n===Professor Pieixoto===\nPieixoto is the \"co-discoverer [with Professor Knotly Wade] of Offred's tapes\". In his presentation at an academic conference, he talks about \"the 'Problems of Authentication in Reference to The Handmaid's Tale{{'\"}}.<ref name=\"GradesaverCharList\" />\nPieixoto is therefore the person who is retelling Offred's story, and so makes the narration even more unreliable than it was originally.\n\n==Setting==\nThe novel is set in an indeterminate dystopian future, speculated to be around the year 2005,<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2006/11/02/margaret-atwoods-tale/|title=Margaret Atwood's Tale|last=Oates|first=Joyce Carol|date=2 November 2006|magazine=The New York Review of Books|access-date=29 March 2016|via=}}</ref> with a fundamentalist theonomy ruling the territory of what had been the United States but is now the Republic of Gilead. Individuals are segregated by categories and dressed according to their social functions. Complex dress codes play a key role in imposing social control within the new society and serve to distinguish people by sex, occupation, and [[caste]].\n\nThe action takes place in what once was the [[Harvard Square]] neighbourhood of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]];{{Sfn | Atwood | 1998 | loc = An Interview | ps =: 'Q: We can figure out that the main character lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts'}}<ref>{{Cite news|last=Mccarthy |first=Mary |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/09/books/no-headline-423986.html?pagewanted=2 |title=No Headline \u2013 The New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=9 February 1986 |accessdate=2018-04-26|newspaper=The New York Times }}</ref> Atwood studied at [[Radcliffe College]], located in this area.\n\n===Politics===\n\nIn Gilead, the bodies of fertile women are politicized and controlled. The North American population is falling as more men and women become infertile (though in Gilead, legally, it is only women who can be the cause of infertility). Gilead's treatment of women is based upon a literal, fundamentalist interpretation of the Bible, meaning that women are the property of and subordinate to their husband, father, or head of household. They are not allowed to do anything that would grant them any power independent of this system. They are not allowed to vote, hold a job, read, possess money, or own anything, among many other restrictions.\n\nA particular quote from ''The Handmaid's Tale'' sums this up: \"The Republic of Gilead, said Aunt Lydia, knows no bounds. Gilead is within you\" (HT 5.2). This describes that there is no way around the societal bounds of women in this new state of government. Handmaids, being not allowed to wed, are given two-year assignments with a commander, and lose their own name: they are called \"Of [their Commander's first name]\", such as the novel's protagonist, known only as Offred. When a handmaid is reassigned, her name changes with her. Their original identities are suppressed. However, while being re-educated as handmaids, they surreptitiously share their names with each other.\n\nIn this book, the government appears to be strong though \"no one in Gilead seems to be a true believer in its revolution\" (Beauchamp). The Commanders, portrayed via Commander Fred, do not agree with their own doctrines. The commander takes Offred at one point to a brothel in order to have sex with her in an informal setting apart from the Ceremony. The wives, portrayed via Serena Joy, former television evangelist, disobey the rules set forth by their commander husbands. Serena smokes black market cigarettes, expresses the forbidden idea that men may be infertile, and schemes to get Offred impregnated by her chauffeur.\n\n===Religion===\nBruce Miller, the executive producer of ''[[The Handmaid's Tale (TV series)|The Handmaid's Tale]]'' television serial, declared with regard to Atwood's book, as well as his series, that Gilead is \"a society that\u2019s based kind of in a perverse misreading of Old Testament laws and codes\".<ref name=\"OHare2017\"/> The author explains that Gilead tries to embody the \"utopian idealism\" present in 20th-century regimes, as well as earlier [[Puritans#New England Puritans|New England Puritanism]].<ref name=\":32\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/20/handmaids-tale-margaret-atwood|title=Haunted by the Handmaid's Tale|last=Atwood|first=Margaret|date=20 January 2012|work=The Guardian|access-date=3 March 2016|via=}}</ref> Both Atwood and Miller stated that the people running Gilead are \"not genuinely Christian\".<ref name=\"LucieSmith2017\">{{cite news|url=http://catholicherald.co.uk/commentandblogs/2017/05/29/should-catholics-watch-the-handmaids-tale/|title=Should Catholics watch The Handmaid's Tale?|last=Lucie-Smith|first=Alexander|date=29 May 2017|newspaper=[[The Catholic Herald]]|language=English|accessdate=18 June 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"OHare2017\"/> The group running Gilead, according to Atwood, is \"not really interested in religion; they're interested in power.\"<ref name=\"Williams2017\"/> In fact, in her [[Christian prayer|prayers]] to God, Offred reflects on Gilead and prays \u201cI don't believe for an instant that what's going on out there is what You meant....

Priests unwilling to convert are executed and hanged from the Wall.  Atwood pits Quaker Christians against the regime by having them help the oppressed, something she feels they would do in reality: \"The Quakers have gone underground, and are running an escape route to Canada, as\u2014I suspect\u2014they would.\"<ref name=\"AtwoodNYT2017\"/>\n\n[[Jews]] are named an exception and classified Sons of [[Jacob]]. Offred observes that Jews refusing to convert are allowed to emigrate from Gilead to Israel, and most choose to leave. However, in the epilogue, Professor Pieixoto reveals that many of the emigrating Jews ended up being dumped into the sea while on the ships ostensibly tasked with transporting them to Israel, due to privatization of the \"repatriation program\" and capitalists' effort to maximize profits. Offred mentions that many Jews who chose to stay were caught [[Crypto-Judaism|secretly practicing Judaism]] and executed.\n\n===Legitimate women===\n;Wives: The top social level permitted to women, achieved by marriage to higher-ranking officers. Wives always wear blue dresses and cloaks, suggesting traditional depictions of the [[Virgin Mary]] in historic Christian art. When a Commander dies, his Wife becomes a '''Widow''' and must dress in black.\n\n;Daughters: The natural or adopted children of the [[ruling class]]. They wear white until marriage, which is [[Arranged Marriage|arranged]] by the government. The narrator's daughter may have been adopted by an infertile Wife and Commander and she is shown in a photograph wearing a long white dress.\n\n;[[Handmaid]]s\n[[File:Old Dutch.gif|right|thumb|The [[bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]]s that Handmaids wear are modelled on Old Dutch Cleanser's faceless mascot, which Atwood in childhood found frightening.<ref name=\"The New York Times\"/>]]\n:Fertile women whose [[social function]] is to bear children for infertile Wives. Handmaids dress in ankle-length red dresses, white caps, and heavy boots. In summer, they change into lighter-weight (but still ankle-length) dresses and slatted shoes. When in public, in winter, they wear ankle-length red cloaks, red gloves, and heavy white [[bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]]s, which they call \"wings\" because the sides stick out, blocking their peripheral vision and shielding their faces from view. Handmaids are women of proven fertility who have broken the law. The law includes both gender crimes, such as lesbianism; and religious crimes, such as adultery (redefined to include sexual relationships with divorced partners since divorce is no longer legal). The Republic of Gilead justifies the use of the handmaids for procreation by referring to two biblical stories: Genesis 30:1\u201313 and Genesis 16:1\u20134. In the first story, Jacob's infertile wife Rachel offers up her handmaid [[Bilhah]] to be a surrogate mother on her behalf, and then her sister Leah does the same with her own handmaid [[Zilpah]] (even though Leah has already given Jacob many sons). In the other story, which appears earlier in Genesis but is cited less frequently, Abraham has sex with his wife's handmaid, [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]]. Handmaids are assigned to Commanders and live in their houses. When unassigned, they live at training centers. Handmaids who successfully bear children continue to live at their commander's house until their children are weaned, at which point they are sent to a new assignment. Those who do produce children, however, will never be declared \"Unwomen\" or sent to the Colonies, even if they never have another baby.\n\n;Aunts: Trainers of the Handmaids. They dress in brown. Aunts promote the role of Handmaid as an honorable way for a sinful woman to redeem herself. They also police the Handmaids, beating some and ordering the maiming of others. The aunts have an unusual amount of autonomy, compared to other women of Gilead. They are the only class of women permitted to read although this is only to fulfil the administrative aspect of their role. (\"The Aunts are allowed to read and write.\" Vintage Books, p.&nbsp;139. However, on p.&nbsp;100 of the Vintage Books edition: \"They played it (the Beatitudes) from a disc; the voice was a man's.\" In the Anchor Books edition: \"They played it (the Beatitudes) from a tape, so not even an Aunt would be guilty of the sin of reading. The voice was a man's. (p.89.)\")\n\n;{{anchor|Martha|Marthas}} Marthas:They are older, infertile women who have domestic skills and are compliant, making them suitable as servants. They dress in green smocks. The title of \"Martha\" is based on the story of [[Jesus at the home of Martha and Mary]] ([[Gospel of Luke]] 10:38\u201342), where Jesus visits [[Mary, sister of Lazarus]] and [[Martha]]; Mary listens to Jesus while Martha works at \"all the preparations that had to be made\".\n\n;{{anchor|Econowife|Econowives}} Econowives: Women married to men of lower-rank, not members of the elite. They are expected to perform all the female functions: domestic duties, companionship, and child-bearing. Their dress is multicoloured red, blue, and green to reflect these multiple roles, and is made of notably cheaper material.\n\nThe [[division of labour]] among the women generates some resentment. Marthas, Wives and Econowives perceive Handmaids as promiscuous and are taught to scorn them. Offred mourns that the women of the various groups have lost their ability to empathize with each other. They are divided in their oppression.\n\n:\n\n===The Ceremony===\n\"The Ceremony\" is a non-marital [[Human sexual activity|sexual act]] sanctioned for reproduction. The ritual requires the Handmaid to lie on her back between the legs of the Wife during the sex act as if they were one person. The Wife has to invite the Handmaid to share her power this way; many Wives consider this both humiliating and offensive. Offred describes the ceremony:\n\n{{Quote | My red skirt is hitched up to my waist, though no higher. Below it the Commander is fucking. What he is fucking is the lower part of my body. I do not say making love, because this is not what he's doing. Copulating too would be inaccurate because it would imply two people and only one is involved. Nor does rape cover it: nothing is going on here that I haven't signed up for.{{sfn|Atwood|1998|p = 94}}}}\n\n==Genre classification==\n{{See also|Social science fiction}}\n''The Handmaid\u2019s

alongside [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], and [[Horror fiction|horror]] is a relatively recent convention. (See also: [[The Internet Speculative Fiction Database]])  Dystopian novels have long been discussed as a type of science fiction, however, with publication of ''The Handmaid's Tale,'' Atwood distinguished the terms science fiction and speculative fiction quite intentionally. In interviews and essays, she has discussed why, observing:\n\n{{quote|I like to make a distinction between science fiction proper and speculative fiction.

Atwood does not see the Republic of Gilead as a purely [[Feminism|feminist]] dystopia, as not all men have greater rights than women.<ref name=\":32\"/> Instead, this society presents a typical dictatorship: \"shaped like a pyramid, with the powerful of both sexes at the apex, the men generally outranking the women at the same level; then descending levels of power and status with men and women in each, all the way down to the bottom, where the unmarried men must serve in the ranks before being awarded an Econowife\".<ref name=\":32\" /> Econowives are women married to men that don't belong to the elite and who are expected to carry out child-bearing, domestic duties, and traditional companionship. When asked about whether her book was feminist, Atwood stated that the presence of women and what happens to them are important to the structure and theme of the book. This aisle of feminism, by default, would make a lot of books feminist.\u00a0 However, she was adamant in her stance that her book did not represent the brand of feminism that victimizes or strips women of moral choice.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Berry|first=Gregory R.|date=June 2010|title=Book Review: Margaret Atwood The Year of the Flood New York, NY: Nan A.

Aisha Matthews tackles the effects of institutional structures that oppress woman and womanhood and connects those to the themes present in ''The Handmaid's Tale.'' She first asserts that structures and social frameworks, such as the patriarchy and societal role of traditional Christian values, are inherently detrimental to the liberation of womanhood. She then makes the connection to the relationship between Offred, Serena Joy, and their Commander, explaining that through this \"perversion of traditional marriage, the Biblical story of Rachel, Jacob, and Bilhah is taken too literally.\" Their relationship and other similar relationships in ''The Handmaid's Tale'' mirror the effects of patriarchal standards of womanliness.<ref name=\":43\">{{Cite journal|last=Matthews|first=Aisha|date=2018-08-18|title=Gender, Ontology, and the Power of the Patriarchy: A Postmodern Feminist Analysis of Octavia Butler's Wild Seed and Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale|journal=Women's Studies|volume=47|issue=6|pages=637\u2013656|doi=10.1080/00497878.2018.1492403|issn=0049-7878}}</ref>\n\n==== Sex and Occupation ====\nThe sexes are strictly divided. Gilead's society values white women's reproductive commodities over those of other ethnicities. Women are categorized \"hierarchically according to class status and reproductive capacity\" as well as \"[[metonymic]]ally colour-coded according to their function and their labour\" (Kauffman 232). The Commander expresses his personal opinion that women are considered inferior to men, as the men are in a position where they have power to control society.\n\nWomen are segregated by clothing, as are men. With rare exception, men wear military or paramilitary uniforms. All classes of men and women are defined by the colours they wear, drawing on colour symbolism and psychology. All lower-status individuals are regulated by this dress code. All \"non-persons\" are banished to the \"Colonies\". Sterile, unmarried women are considered to be non-persons. Both men and women sent there wear grey dresses.\n\nThe women, particularly the handmaids, are stripped of their individual identities as they lack formal names, taking on their assigned commander's first name in most cases. This hierarchical society has forced women to come to terms with their inability to make decisions about their own bodies and lives.\n\n==== Unwomen ====\nSterile women, the unmarried, some widows, feminists, lesbians, nuns, and politically dissident women: all women who are incapable of [[social integration]] within the Republic's strict gender divisions. Gilead exiles Unwomen to \"the Colonies\", areas both of agricultural production and deadly pollution. Joining them are handmaids who fail to bear a child after three two-year assignments.\n\n==== Jezebels ====\nJezebels are women who are forced to become prostitutes and entertainers. They are available only to the Commanders and to their guests. Offred portrays Jezebels as attractive and educated; they may be unsuitable as handmaids due to temperament. They have been sterilized, a surgery that is forbidden to other women. They operate in unofficial but state-sanctioned brothels, unknown to most women. Jezebels, whose title also comes from the Bible (note Queen [[Jezebel]] in the [[Books of Kings]]), dress in the remnants of sexualized costumes from \"the time before\", such as cheerleaders' costumes, school uniforms, and [[Playboy Bunny]] costumes. Jezebels can wear make-up, drink alcohol and socialize with men, but are tightly controlled by the Aunts. When they pass their sexual prime and/or their looks fade, they are discarded without any precision as to whether they are killed or sent to the Colonies in the novel.\n\n===Race analysis===\n[[African Americans]], the main non-white ethnic group in this society, are called the [[Hamitic|Children of Ham]]. A state TV broadcast mentions they have been relocated \"en masse\" to \"National Homelands\" in the Midwest, which are suggestive of the [[Bantustan|Apartheid-era homelands]] set up by South Africa. Ana Cottle characterized ''The Handmaid's Tale'' as \"[[white feminism]]\", noting that Atwood does away with black people in a few lines by relocating the \"Children of Ham\" while borrowing heavily from the African-American experience and applying it to white women.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/the-establishment/the-handmaids-tale-a-white-feminist-s-dystopia-80da75a40dc5|title=The Handmaid's Tale: A White Feminist Dystopia|last=|first=|date=17 May 2017|website=theestablishment.co|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/06/the-handmaids-tale-greatest-failing-is-how-it-handles-race.html|title=The Handmaid's Tale's Greatest Failing Is How It Handles Race|last=Basti\u00e9n|first=Angelica Jade|date=June 2017|website=Vulture|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref>  \nIt is implied that [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] living in territories under the rule of Gilead are exterminated. [[Jews]] are given a choice between converting to the state religion or being \"repatriated\" to [[Israel]]. However, converts who were subsequently discovered with any symbolic representations or artifacts of [[Judaism]] were executed, and the repatriation scheme was privatized. \nMany argue that readers cannot simply ignore the parallels between racism and sexism within ''The Handmaid's Tale''. Many critics believe that Atwood chooses to erase the black community from the novel by sending them elsewhere in order to make the Republic of Gilead a white society. Scholar Ben Merriman believes that Atwood's portrayal of society in ''The Handmaid's Tale'' mimics that of a society run on black slavery, due to the novel's heavy focuses on \"sexual exploitation, isolation, and compelled ignorance that accompany severe economic and political powerlessness\", which are themes often associated with African-American slavery. Merriman accuses Atwood of purposely failing to acknowledge the parallels between her novel and the African-American experience. In Gilead, Handmaids are forbidden to read or write and the men in charge control access to literacy. In black slavery, African-Americans had restrictions on literacy as well. Additionally, ''The Handmaid's Tale'' is written as an oral narration of Offred's experiences; oral narration is a theme commonly associated with slave narratives.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/A206534450/LitRC?u=wash43584&sid=LitRC&xid=a7ab0743|title=White-washing oppression in atwood's the handmaid's tale.|last=Merriman|first=Ben|date=2009|website=Gale|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Language analysis ===\nIn the novel's fictional fundamentalist society, ''sterile'' is an outlawed word.{{Sfn | Atwood | 1998 | p = 161}} In this society, there is no such thing as a sterile man. In this culture, women are either fruitful or barren, the latter of which are declared to be \"unwomen\" and are sent to the colonies with the rest of the \"unwomen\" to do life-threatening work until their death, which is, on average, three years.\n\nAtwood emphasises how changes in context affect behaviours and attitudes by repeating the phrase \"Context is all\" throughout the novel, establishing this precept as a [[Motif (narrative)|motif]].{{Sfn | Atwood | 1998 | pp = 144, 192}} Playing the game of [[Scrabble]] with her Commander illustrates the key significance of changes in \"context\"; once \"the game of old men and women\", the game became forbidden for women to play and therefore \"desirable\".{{Sfn | Atwood | 1998 | pp = 178\u201379}} Through living in a morally rigid society, Offred has come to perceive the world differently from earlier. Offred expresses amazement at how \"It has taken so little time to change our minds about things\".{{Sfn | Atwood | 1998 | pp = 36}} Wearing revealing clothes and makeup had been part of her former life, but when she sees Japanese tourists dressed that way, she now feels the women are inappropriately dressed.{{Sfn | Atwood | 1998 | pp = 36}}\n\nOffred can read but not translate the phrase \"[[Illegitimi non carborundum|nolite te bastardes carborundorum]]\" carved into the closet wall of her small bedroom; this [[Dog Latin|mock-Latin]] [[aphorism]] signifies \"Don't let the bastards grind you down\".{{Sfn | Atwood | 1998 | pp = 235}}\n\n==Awards==\n\n* 1985 \u2013 [[Governor General's Award for English-language fiction]] (winner)\n* 1986 \u2013 [[Booker Prize]] (nominated)\n* 1986 \u2013 [[Nebula Award]] (nominated)\n* 1987 \u2013 [[Arthur C.

The novel's title echoes the component parts of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', which is a series of connected stories (\"The Merchant's Tale\", \"The Parson's Tale\", etc.).<ref name=\"The New York Times\">{{cite news|last1=Atwood|first1=Margaret|title=Margaret Atwood on What 'The Handmaid's Tale' Means in the Age of Trump|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/books/review/margaret-atwood-handmaids-tale-age-of-trump.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur|accessdate=11 March 2017|work=The New York Times|date=10 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n''The Handmaid's Tale'' is structured into two parts, by night and by other various events. This novel can be interpreted as a double narrative, Offred's tale and the handmaids' tales. The night sections are solely about Offred, and the other sections (shopping, waiting room, household, etc.) are the stories that describe the possible life of every handmaid, though from the perspective of Offred. In many of these sections, Offred jumps between past and present as she retells the events leading up to the fall of women's rights and the current details of the life that she now lives.\n\n''The Handmaid's Tale'' won the 1985 [[Governor General's Award]] and the first [[Arthur C. Clarke Award]] in 1987; it was also nominated for the 1986 [[Nebula Award]], the 1986 [[Man Booker Prize|Booker Prize]], and the 1987 [[Prometheus Award]]. The book has been adapted into a [[The Handmaid's Tale (film)|1990 film]], a [[The Handmaid's Tale (opera)|2000 opera]], [[The Handmaid's Tale (TV series)|a 2017 television series]], and other media.\n\nIn 2019, a sequel novel, ''[[The Testaments]]'', was published.\n\n==Plot summary==\nAfter a staged attack that killed the [[President of the United States]] and most of [[United States Congress|Congress]], a radical political group called the \"Sons of Jacob\" used quasi-Christian ideology to launch a [[Second American Revolution|revolution]]. The [[United States Constitution]] was suspended, newspapers were censored, and what was formerly the United States of America was changed into a [[military dictatorship]] resembling a [[theonomy]], known as the Republic of [[Gilead]].<ref name=\"Douthat2017\"/> The new regime moved quickly to consolidate its power, overtaking all other religious groups, including traditional Christian denominations. In addition, the regime reorganized society using a peculiar interpretation of some [[Old Testament]] ideas, and a new militarized, hierarchical model of social and [[religious fanaticism]] among its newly created social classes. Above all, the biggest change is the severe limitation of people's rights, especially those of women, who are not allowed to read, write, own property or handle money. Most significantly, women are deprived of control over their own reproductive functions.\n\nThe story is told in first-person narration by a woman named Offred. In this era of declining birth rates due to increasing infertility caused by environmental pollution and radiation, she is one of few fertile women remaining. Therefore, she is forcibly assigned to produce children for the \"Commanders\", the ruling class of men, and is known as a \"Handmaid\" based on the biblical story of [[Rachel]] and her handmaid [[Bilhah]]. Apart from Handmaids, other women are also classed socially and follow a strict dress code, ranked highest to lowest: the Commanders' Wives in blue, the Handmaids in red with white veils around their faces, the Aunts (who train and indoctrinate the Handmaids) in brown, the Marthas (cooks and maids) in green, \"Econowives\" who handle everything in the domestic sphere in stripes, young, unmarried girls in white, and widows in black.\n\nOffred details her life starting with her third assignment as a Handmaid to a Commander. Interspersed with her narratives of her present-day experiences are flashbacks  of her life before and during the beginning of the revolution, when she finds she has lost all autonomy to her husband, their failed attempt to escape to Canada, her indoctrination into life as a Handmaid by the government-trained Aunts, and the successful escape of her friend Moira. At her new home, she is treated poorly by a woman called Serena Joy, the Commander's wife and a former Christian media personality, who supported women's domesticity and subordinate role well before Gilead was established. To Offred's surprise, the Commander requests to see her outside of the \"Ceremony\", a sexual ritual obligatory for handmaids and intended to result in conception in the presence of his wife. The two begin an illegal relationship where they play [[Scrabble]] and Offred is allowed to ask favours of him, whether in terms of information or material items. Finally, he gives her lingerie and takes her to a government-run [[brothel]] called Jezebel's meant to add variety to men's sex lives, which (as claimed by the Commander) is necessary. Offred unexpectedly encounters Moira there, with her will broken, and she learns that those who are found breaking the law are sent to the Colonies to clean up toxic waste or are allowed to work at Jezebel's as punishment.\n\nIn the days between her visits to the Commander, Offred also learns from her shopping partner, a woman called Ofglen, of the Mayday resistance, an underground network working to overthrow the Republic of Gilead. Not knowing of Offred's criminal acts with her husband, Serena begins to suspect that the Commander is infertile, and arranges for Offred to begin a covert sexual relationship with Nick, the Commander's personal servant. After their initial sexual encounter, Offred and Nick begin to meet on their own initiative as well, with Offred discovering that she enjoys these intimate moments despite memories of her husband, and shares potentially dangerous information about her past with him. However, shortly after, Ofglen disappears (reported as a suicide), and Serena finds evidence of the relationship between Offred and the Commander, which causes Offred to contemplate suicide.\n\nOffred tells Nick that she thinks she is pregnant. Shortly afterward, men arrive at the house wearing the uniform of the secret police, the Eyes of God, known informally as \"the Eyes\", to take her away. As she is led to a waiting van, Nick tells her to trust him and go with the men. It is unclear whether the men are actually Eyes, or members of the Mayday resistance, an underground network to overthrow the Republic of Gilead. Offred is still unsure if Nick is a member of Mayday or an Eye posing as one, and does not know if leaving will result in her escape or her capture. Ultimately, she enters the van with her future uncertain.\n\nThe novel concludes with a [[metafictional]] [[epilogue]], described as a partial transcript of an international historical association conference taking place in the year 2195. The keynote speaker explains that Offred's account of the events of the novel was recorded onto cassette tapes later found and transcribed by historians studying what is then called \"the Gilead Period.\" It is implied that, following the collapse of the theonomic Republic of Gilead, a more equal society re-emerged with a restoration of normal rights for women and freedom of religion<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Callaway|first=Alanna|date=|title=Women disunited : Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale as a critique of feminism|url=https://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=4501&context=etd_theses|journal=San Jose State University SJSU ScholarWorks|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>. However, the future setting still presents some issues regarding attitudes towards women, as seen when Professor Peixoto makes a sexist joke about Professor Maryann Crescent Moon, causing laughter from the audience, and highlighting his ignorance toward the situation.\n\n== Background ==\nFitting with her claims that ''The Handmaid's Tale'' is a work of speculative fiction, not science fiction, Atwood's novel offers a satirical view of various social, political, and religious trends of the United States in the 1980s. Her motivation for writing the novel was that in the 1980s, the religious right was discussing what they would do with/to women if they took power, including the [[Moral Majority]], [[Focus on the Family]], the [[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]] and the Ronald Reagan administration.<ref name=\":1\" /> Further, Atwood questions what would happen if these trends, and especially \"casually held attitudes about women\" were taken to their logical end.<ref name=\":11\" /> Atwood continues to argue that all of the scenarios offered in The Handmaid's Tale have actually occurred in real life\u2014in an interview she gave regarding Oryx and Crake, Atwood maintains that \"As with The Handmaid's Tale, I didn't put in anything that we haven't already done, we're not already doing, we're seriously trying to do, coupled with trends that are already in progress... So all of those things are real, and therefore the amount of pure invention is close to nil.\"<ref name=\":12\" /> Atwood was also known to carry around newspaper clippings to her various interviews to support her fiction's basis in reality.<ref name=\":22\"/> Atwood has explained that The Handmaid's Tale is a response to those who claim the oppressive, totalitarian, and religious governments that have taken hold in other countries throughout the years \"can't happen here\"\u2014but in this work, she has tried to show how such a takeover might play out.<ref name=\":42\"/>\n\nAtwood's inspiration for the Republic of Gilead came from her time studying early American Puritans while at Harvard, which she attended on a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship.<ref name=\":11\" /> Atwood argues that the modern view of the Puritans\u2014that they came to America to flee religious persecution in England and set up a religiously tolerant society\u2014is misleading, and that instead, these Puritan leaders wanted to establish a monolithic theocracy where religious dissent would not be tolerated.<ref name=\":11\" /> Atwood also had a personal connection to the Puritans, and she dedicates the novel to her own ancestor Mary Webster, who was accused of witchcraft in Puritan New England but survived her hanging.<ref name=\":13\" /> Due to the totalitarian nature of Gileadan society, Atwood, in creating the setting, drew from the \"utopian idealism\" present in 20th century r\u00e9gimes, such as Cambodia and Romania, as well as earlier New England Puritanism.<ref name=\":32\"/> Atwood has argued that a coup, such as the one depicted in The Handmaid's Tale, would misuse religion in order to achieve its own ends:.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":32\" />\n\nAtwood, with respect to those leading Gilead, further stated:<ref name=\"Williams2017\" /><blockquote>I don't consider these people to be Christians because they do not have at the core of their behavior and ideologies what I, in my feeble Canadian way, would consider to be the core of Christianity \u2026 and that would be not only love your neighbors but love your enemies. That would also be 'I was sick and you visited me not' and such and such \u2026And that would include also concern for the environment, because you can't love your neighbor or even your enemy, unless you love your neighbor's oxygen, food, and water. You can't love your neighbor or your enemy if you're presuming policies that are going to cause those people to die. \u2026 Of course faith can be a force for good and often has been. So faith is a force for good particularly when people are feeling beleaguered and in need of hope. So you can have bad iterations and you can also have the iteration in which people have got too much power and then start abusing it. But that is human behavior, so you can't lay it down to religion. You can find the same in any power situation, such as politics or ideologies that purport to be atheist. Need I mention the former Soviet Union? So it is not a question of religion making people behave badly. It is a question of human beings getting power and then wanting more of it.</blockquote>In the same vein, Atwood also declared that \"In the real world today, some religious groups are leading movements for the protection of vulnerable groups, including women.\"<ref name=\"The New York Times\" /> Atwood also draws connections between the ways in which Gilead's leaders maintain their power and other examples of actual totalitarian governments. In her interviews, Atwood offers up Afghanistan as an example of a religious theocracy forcing women out of the public sphere and into their homes, as in Gilead.<ref name=\":22\"/><ref name=\":11\" /> The \"state-sanctioned murder of dissidents\" was inspired by the Philippines, and the last General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu's obsession with increasing the birth rate led to the strict policing of pregnant women and the outlawing of birth control and abortion.<ref name=\":22\"/> However, Atwood clearly explains that many of these deplorable acts were not just present in other cultures and countries, \"but within Western society, and within the 'Christian' tradition itself\".<ref name=\":32\"/>\n\nThe Republic of Gilead struggles with infertility, making Offred's services as a Handmaid vital to producing children and thus reproducing the society. Handmaids themselves are \"untouchable\", but their ability to signify status is equated to that of slaves or servants throughout history.<ref name=\":32\"/> Atwood connects their concerns with infertility to real-life problems our world faces, such as radiation, chemical pollution, and venereal disease (HIV/AIDS is specifically mentioned in the \"Historical Notes\" section at the end of the novel, which was a relatively new disease at the time of Atwood's writing whose long-term impact was still unknown). Atwood's strong stance on environmental issues and their negative consequences for our society has presented itself in other works such as her MaddAddam trilogy, and refers back to her growing up with biologists and her own scientific curiosity.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Offred===\nOffred is the [[protagonist]] and [[narrator]] who takes the readers through life in Gilead. She was labeled a \"wanton woman\" when Gilead was established because she had married a man who was divorced. All divorces were nullified by the new government, meaning her husband was now considered still married to his first wife, making Offred an adulteress. In trying to escape Gilead, she was separated from her husband and daughter. She is part of the first generation of Gilead's women, those who remember pre-Gilead times. Proved fertile, she is considered an important commodity and has been placed as a \"handmaid\" in the home of \"the Commander\" and his wife Serena Joy, to bear a child for them (Serena Joy is believed to be infertile).<ref name=\"GradesaverCharList\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gradesaver.com/the-handmaids-tale/study-guide/character-list/ | title = The Handmaid's Tale Study Guide: Character List | publisher = Gradesaver | date = 22 May 2009}}<!--Some of the information in the sec. on Characters below and other sections of this Wikipedia article may have been taken from this or a similar secondary source. Such sources need to be identified, acknowledged, and cited properly throughout to avoid appearance of [[Wikipedia:Plagiarism|Plagiarism]].--></ref> Readers are able to see Offred's resistance of The Republic of Gilead on the inside through her thoughts.\n\nOffred is a [[slave name]] that describes her function: she is \"of Fred\" (i.e., she belongs to Fred\u2013presumed to be the name of the Commander\u2013and is considered a [[concubine]]). In the novel, Offred says that she is ''not'' a concubine, but a tool; a \"two legged womb\". The Handmaids' names say nothing about who the women really are; their only identity is as the Commander's property. \"Offred\" is also a pun on the word \"offered\", as in \"offered as a sacrifice\", and \"of red\" because the red dress assigned for the handmaids in Gilead.\n\nIn Atwood's original novel, Offred's real name is never revealed; however, [[Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff]]'s 1990 film adaptation gave Offred the real name Kate,<ref>[https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/03/the-forgotten-handmaids-tale/388514/ \"The Forgotten Handmaid's Tale\"]. ''[[The Atlantic]]'', March 24, 2015.</ref> while the television series gave her the real name June.\n\nThe women in training to be Handmaids whisper names across their beds at night. The names are \"Alma. Janine. Dolores. Moira. June,\" and all are later accounted for except June. In addition, one of the Aunts tells the handmaids-in-training to stop \"mooning and June-ing\".{{Sfn | Atwood | 1986 | p = 220}} From this and other references, some readers have inferred that her birth name could be \"June\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Offred's Real Name In 'The Handmaid's Tale' Is The Only Piece Of Power She Still Holds |first=Dana |last=Getz |work=[[Bustle (magazine)|Bustle]] |date=April 26, 2017 |quote=In Margaret Atwood's original novel, Offred's real name is never revealed.

Documentation of the usage of source appears to be not precise or accurate enough (throughout?) for verification. Has material been [[Wikipedia:Plagiarism|plagiarized]] from this source?--></ref> When the Hulu TV series chose to state outright that Offred's real name is June, Atwood wrote that it was not her original intention to imply that Offred's real name is June \"but it fits, so readers are welcome to it if they wish\".<ref name=\"The New York Times\"/> The revelation of Offred's real name serves only to humanize her in the presence of the other Handmaids.\n\n===The Commander===\nThe Commander says that he was a scientist and was previously involved in something similar to [[market research]] before Gilead's inception. Later, it is hypothesized, but not confirmed, that he might have been one of the architects of the Republic and its laws. Presumably, his first name is \"Fred\", though that, too, may be a pseudonym. He engages in forbidden intellectual pursuits with Offred, such as playing [[Scrabble]], and introduces her to a secret club that serves as a brothel for high-ranking officers. Offred learns that the Commander carried on a similar relationship with his previous handmaid, who later killed herself when his wife found out.\n\nIn the epilogue, Professor Peixoto speculates that one of two figures, both instrumental in the establishment of Gilead, may have been the Commander, based on the name \"Fred\". It is his belief that the Commander was a man named Frederick R. Waterford who was killed in a purge shortly after Offred was taken away, charged with harbouring an enemy agent.\n\n===Serena Joy===\nSerena Joy is a former [[televangelist]] and the Commander's wife in the fundamentalist theonomy. The state took away her power and public recognition, and tries to hide her past as a television figure. Offred identifies Serena Joy by recalling seeing her on TV when she was a little girl early on Saturday mornings while waiting for the cartoons to air. Believed to be sterile (although the suggestion is made that the Commander is sterile, Gileadean laws attribute sterility only to women), she is forced to accept that he has use of a handmaid. She resents having to take part in \"The Ceremony\", a monthly fertility ritual. She strikes a deal with Offred to arrange for her to have sex with Nick in order to become pregnant. According to Professor Pieixoto in the epilogue, \"Serena Joy\" or \"Pam\" are pseudonyms; the character's real name is implied to be Thelma.\n\n===Ofglen===\nOfglen is a neighbour of Offred's and a fellow Handmaid. She is partnered with Offred to do the daily shopping. Handmaids are never alone and are expected to police each other's behaviour. Ofglen is a member of the Mayday resistance. In contrast to Offred, she is daring. She knocks out a Mayday spy who is to be tortured and killed in order to save him the pain of a violent death. Offred is told that when Ofglen vanishes, it is because she has committed suicide before the government can take her into custody due to her membership in the resistance, possibly to avoid giving away any information.\n\nA new handmaid, also called Ofglen, takes Ofglen's place, and is assigned as Offred's shopping partner. She threatens Offred against any thought of resistance. In addition, she breaks protocol by telling her what happened to the first Ofglen.\n\n===Nick===\nNick is the Commander's chauffeur, who lives above the garage. By Serena Joy's arrangement, he and Offred start a sexual relationship to increase her chance of getting pregnant. If she were unable to bear the Commander a child, she would be declared sterile and shipped to the ecological wastelands of the Colonies. Offred begins to develop feelings for him. Nick is an ambiguous character, and Offred does not know if he is a party loyalist or part of the resistance, though he identifies himself as the latter. The epilogue suggests that he really was part of the resistance, and aided Offred in escaping the Commander's house.\n\n===Moira===\nMoira has been a close friend of Offred's since college. In the novel, their relationship represents a female friendship that the Republic of Gilead tries to block. A lesbian, she has resisted the [[homophobia]] of Gilead society. Moira is taken to be a Handmaid soon after Offred. She escapes by stealing an Aunt's pass and clothes, but Offred later finds her working as a prostitute in a party-run brothel. She was caught and chose the brothel rather than to be sent to the Colonies. Moira exemplifies defiance against Gilead by rejecting every value that is forced onto the citizens.\n\n===Luke===\nLuke was Offred's husband before the formation of Gilead, having divorced his first wife to marry her. Under Gilead, all divorces were retroactively nullified, resulting in Offred being considered an adulteress and their daughter [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]]. Offred was forced to become a Handmaid and her daughter was given to a loyalist family. Since their attempt to escape to Canada, Offred has heard nothing of Luke. She wavers between believing him dead or imprisoned.\n\n===Professor Pieixoto===\nPieixoto is the \"co-discoverer [with Professor Knotly Wade] of Offred's tapes\". In his presentation at an academic conference, he talks about \"the 'Problems of Authentication in Reference to The Handmaid's Tale{{'\"}}.<ref name=\"GradesaverCharList\" />\nPieixoto is therefore the person who is retelling Offred's story, and so makes the narration even more unreliable than it was originally.\n\n==Setting==\nThe novel is set in an indeterminate dystopian future, speculated to be around the year 2005,<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2006/11/02/margaret-atwoods-tale/|title=Margaret Atwood's Tale|last=Oates|first=Joyce Carol|date=2 November 2006|magazine=The New York Review of Books|access-date=29 March 2016|via=}}</ref> with a fundamentalist theonomy ruling the territory of what had been the United States but is now the Republic of Gilead. Individuals are segregated by categories and dressed according to their social functions. Complex dress codes play a key role in imposing social control within the new society and serve to distinguish people by sex, occupation, and [[caste]].\n\nThe action takes place in what once was the [[Harvard Square]] neighbourhood of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]];{{Sfn | Atwood | 1998 | loc = An Interview | ps =: 'Q: We can figure out that the main character lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts'}}<ref>{{Cite news|last=Mccarthy |first=Mary |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/09/books/no-headline-423986.html?pagewanted=2 |title=No Headline \u2013 The New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=9 February 1986 |accessdate=2018-04-26|newspaper=The New York Times }}</ref> Atwood studied at [[Radcliffe College]], located in this area.\n\n===Politics===\n\nIn Gilead, the bodies of fertile women are politicized and controlled. The North American population is falling as more men and women become infertile (though in Gilead, legally, it is only women who can be the cause of infertility). Gilead's treatment of women is based upon a literal, fundamentalist interpretation of the Bible, meaning that women are the property of and subordinate to their husband, father, or head of household. They are not allowed to do anything that would grant them any power independent of this system. They are not allowed to vote, hold a job, read, possess money, or own anything, among many other restrictions.\n\nA particular quote from ''The Handmaid's Tale'' sums this up: \"The Republic of Gilead, said Aunt Lydia, knows no bounds. Gilead is within you\" (HT 5.2). This describes that there is no way around the societal bounds of women in this new state of government. Handmaids, being not allowed to wed, are given two-year assignments with a commander, and lose their own name: they are called \"Of [their Commander's first name]\", such as the novel's protagonist, known only as Offred. When a handmaid is reassigned, her name changes with her. Their original identities are suppressed. However, while being re-educated as handmaids, they surreptitiously share their names with each other.\n\nIn this book, the government appears to be strong though \"no one in Gilead seems to be a true believer in its revolution\" (Beauchamp). The Commanders, portrayed via Commander Fred, do not agree with their own doctrines. The commander takes Offred at one point to a brothel in order to have sex with her in an informal setting apart from the Ceremony. The wives, portrayed via Serena Joy, former television evangelist, disobey the rules set forth by their commander husbands. Serena smokes black market cigarettes, expresses the forbidden idea that men may be infertile, and schemes to get Offred impregnated by her chauffeur.\n\n===Religion===\nBruce Miller, the executive producer of ''[[The Handmaid's Tale (TV series)|The Handmaid's Tale]]'' television serial, declared with regard to Atwood's book, as well as his series, that Gilead is \"a society that\u2019s based kind of in a perverse misreading of Old Testament laws and codes\".<ref name=\"OHare2017\"/> The author explains that Gilead tries to embody the \"utopian idealism\" present in 20th-century regimes, as well as earlier [[Puritans#New England Puritans|New England Puritanism]].<ref name=\":32\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/20/handmaids-tale-margaret-atwood|title=Haunted by the Handmaid's Tale|last=Atwood|first=Margaret|date=20 January 2012|work=The Guardian|access-date=3 March 2016|via=}}</ref> Both Atwood and Miller stated that the people running Gilead are \"not genuinely Christian\".<ref name=\"LucieSmith2017\">{{cite news|url=http://catholicherald.co.uk/commentandblogs/2017/05/29/should-catholics-watch-the-handmaids-tale/|title=Should Catholics watch The Handmaid's Tale?|last=Lucie-Smith|first=Alexander|date=29 May 2017|newspaper=[[The Catholic Herald]]|language=English|accessdate=18 June 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"OHare2017\"/> The group running Gilead, according to Atwood, is \"not really interested in religion; they're interested in power.\"<ref name=\"Williams2017\"/> In fact, in her [[Christian prayer|prayers]] to God, Offred reflects on Gilead and prays \u201cI don't believe for an instant that what's going on out there is what You meant....

Priests unwilling to convert are executed and hanged from the Wall.  Atwood pits Quaker Christians against the regime by having them help the oppressed, something she feels they would do in reality: \"The Quakers have gone underground, and are running an escape route to Canada, as\u2014I suspect\u2014they would.\"<ref name=\"AtwoodNYT2017\"/>\n\n[[Jews]] are named an exception and classified Sons of [[Jacob]]. Offred observes that Jews refusing to convert are allowed to emigrate from Gilead to Israel, and most choose to leave. However, in the epilogue, Professor Pieixoto reveals that many of the emigrating Jews ended up being dumped into the sea while on the ships ostensibly tasked with transporting them to Israel, due to privatization of the \"repatriation program\" and capitalists' effort to maximize profits. Offred mentions that many Jews who chose to stay were caught [[Crypto-Judaism|secretly practicing Judaism]] and executed.\n\n===Legitimate women===\n;Wives: The top social level permitted to women, achieved by marriage to higher-ranking officers. Wives always wear blue dresses and cloaks, suggesting traditional depictions of the [[Virgin Mary]] in historic Christian art. When a Commander dies, his Wife becomes a '''Widow''' and must dress in black.\n\n;Daughters: The natural or adopted children of the [[ruling class]]. They wear white until marriage, which is [[Arranged Marriage|arranged]] by the government. The narrator's daughter may have been adopted by an infertile Wife and Commander and she is shown in a photograph wearing a long white dress.\n\n;[[Handmaid]]s\n[[File:Old Dutch.gif|right|thumb|The [[bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]]s that Handmaids wear are modelled on Old Dutch Cleanser's faceless mascot, which Atwood in childhood found frightening.<ref name=\"The New York Times\"/>]]\n:Fertile women whose [[social function]] is to bear children for infertile Wives. Handmaids dress in ankle-length red dresses, white caps, and heavy boots. In summer, they change into lighter-weight (but still ankle-length) dresses and slatted shoes. When in public, in winter, they wear ankle-length red cloaks, red gloves, and heavy white [[bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]]s, which they call \"wings\" because the sides stick out, blocking their peripheral vision and shielding their faces from view. Handmaids are women of proven fertility who have broken the law. The law includes both gender crimes, such as lesbianism; and religious crimes, such as adultery (redefined to include sexual relationships with divorced partners since divorce is no longer legal). The Republic of Gilead justifies the use of the handmaids for procreation by referring to two biblical stories: Genesis 30:1\u201313 and Genesis 16:1\u20134. In the first story, Jacob's infertile wife Rachel offers up her handmaid [[Bilhah]] to be a surrogate mother on her behalf, and then her sister Leah does the same with her own handmaid [[Zilpah]] (even though Leah has already given Jacob many sons). In the other story, which appears earlier in Genesis but is cited less frequently, Abraham has sex with his wife's handmaid, [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]]. Handmaids are assigned to Commanders and live in their houses. When unassigned, they live at training centers. Handmaids who successfully bear children continue to live at their commander's house until their children are weaned, at which point they are sent to a new assignment. Those who do produce children, however, will never be declared \"Unwomen\" or sent to the Colonies, even if they never have another baby.\n\n;Aunts: Trainers of the Handmaids. They dress in brown. Aunts promote the role of Handmaid as an honorable way for a sinful woman to redeem herself. They also police the Handmaids, beating some and ordering the maiming of others. The aunts have an unusual amount of autonomy, compared to other women of Gilead. They are the only class of women permitted to read although this is only to fulfil the administrative aspect of their role. (\"The Aunts are allowed to read and write.\" Vintage Books, p.&nbsp;139. However, on p.&nbsp;100 of the Vintage Books edition: \"They played it (the Beatitudes) from a disc; the voice was a man's.\" In the Anchor Books edition: \"They played it (the Beatitudes) from a tape, so not even an Aunt would be guilty of the sin of reading. The voice was a man's. (p.89.)\")\n\n;{{anchor|Martha|Marthas}} Marthas:They are older, infertile women who have domestic skills and are compliant, making them suitable as servants. They dress in green smocks. The title of \"Martha\" is based on the story of [[Jesus at the home of Martha and Mary]] ([[Gospel of Luke]] 10:38\u201342), where Jesus visits [[Mary, sister of Lazarus]] and [[Martha]]; Mary listens to Jesus while Martha works at \"all the preparations that had to be made\".\n\n;{{anchor|Econowife|Econowives}} Econowives: Women married to men of lower-rank, not members of the elite. They are expected to perform all the female functions: domestic duties, companionship, and child-bearing. Their dress is multicoloured red, blue, and green to reflect these multiple roles, and is made of notably cheaper material.\n\nThe [[division of labour]] among the women generates some resentment. Marthas, Wives and Econowives perceive Handmaids as promiscuous and are taught to scorn them. Offred mourns that the women of the various groups have lost their ability to empathize with each other. They are divided in their oppression.\n\n:\n\n===The Ceremony===\n\"The Ceremony\" is a non-marital [[Human sexual activity|sexual act]] sanctioned for reproduction. The ritual requires the Handmaid to lie on her back between the legs of the Wife during the sex act as if they were one person. The Wife has to invite the Handmaid to share her power this way; many Wives consider this both humiliating and offensive. Offred describes the ceremony:\n\n{{Quote | My red skirt is hitched up to my waist, though no higher. Below it the Commander is fucking. What he is fucking is the lower part of my body. I do not say making love, because this is not what he's doing. Copulating too would be inaccurate because it would imply two people and only one is involved. Nor does rape cover it: nothing is going on here that I haven't signed up for.{{sfn|Atwood|1998|p = 94}}}}\n\n==Genre classification==\n{{See also|Social science fiction}}\n''The Handmaid\u2019s

alongside [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], and [[Horror fiction|horror]] is a relatively recent convention. (See also: [[The Internet Speculative Fiction Database]])  Dystopian novels have long been discussed as a type of science fiction, however, with publication of ''The Handmaid's Tale,'' Atwood distinguished the terms science fiction and speculative fiction quite intentionally. In interviews and essays, she has discussed why, observing:\n\n{{quote|I like to make a distinction between science fiction proper and speculative fiction.

Atwood does not see the Republic of Gilead as a purely [[Feminism|feminist]] dystopia, as not all men have greater rights than women.<ref name=\":32\"/> Instead, this society presents a typical dictatorship: \"shaped like a pyramid, with the powerful of both sexes at the apex, the men generally outranking the women at the same level; then descending levels of power and status with men and women in each, all the way down to the bottom, where the unmarried men must serve in the ranks before being awarded an Econowife\".<ref name=\":32\" /> Econowives are women married to men that don't belong to the elite and who are expected to carry out child-bearing, domestic duties, and traditional companionship. When asked about whether her book was feminist, Atwood stated that the presence of women and what happens to them are important to the structure and theme of the book. This aisle of feminism, by default, would make a lot of books feminist.\u00a0 However, she was adamant in her stance that her book did not represent the brand of feminism that victimizes or strips women of moral choice.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Berry|first=Gregory R.|date=June 2010|title=Book Review: Margaret Atwood The Year of the Flood New York, NY: Nan A.

Aisha Matthews tackles the effects of institutional structures that oppress woman and womanhood and connects those to the themes present in ''The Handmaid's Tale.'' She first asserts that structures and social frameworks, such as the patriarchy and societal role of traditional Christian values, are inherently detrimental to the liberation of womanhood. She then makes the connection to the relationship between Offred, Serena Joy, and their Commander, explaining that through this \"perversion of traditional marriage, the Biblical story of Rachel, Jacob, and Bilhah is taken too literally.\" Their relationship and other similar relationships in ''The Handmaid's Tale'' mirror the effects of patriarchal standards of womanliness.<ref name=\":43\">{{Cite journal|last=Matthews|first=Aisha|date=2018-08-18|title=Gender, Ontology, and the Power of the Patriarchy: A Postmodern Feminist Analysis of Octavia Butler's Wild Seed and Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale|journal=Women's Studies|volume=47|issue=6|pages=637\u2013656|doi=10.1080/00497878.2018.1492403|issn=0049-7878}}</ref>\n\n==== Sex and Occupation ====\nThe sexes are strictly divided. Gilead's society values white women's reproductive commodities over those of other ethnicities. Women are categorized \"hierarchically according to class status and reproductive capacity\" as well as \"[[metonymic]]ally colour-coded according to their function and their labour\" (Kauffman 232). The Commander expresses his personal opinion that women are considered inferior to men, as the men are in a position where they have power to control society.\n\nWomen are segregated by clothing, as are men. With rare exception, men wear military or paramilitary uniforms. All classes of men and women are defined by the colours they wear, drawing on colour symbolism and psychology. All lower-status individuals are regulated by this dress code. All \"non-persons\" are banished to the \"Colonies\". Sterile, unmarried women are considered to be non-persons. Both men and women sent there wear grey dresses.\n\nThe women, particularly the handmaids, are stripped of their individual identities as they lack formal names, taking on their assigned commander's first name in most cases. This hierarchical society has forced women to come to terms with their inability to make decisions about their own bodies and lives.\n\n==== Unwomen ====\nSterile women, the unmarried, some widows, feminists, lesbians, nuns, and politically dissident women: all women who are incapable of [[social integration]] within the Republic's strict gender divisions. Gilead exiles Unwomen to \"the Colonies\", areas both of agricultural production and deadly pollution. Joining them are handmaids who fail to bear a child after three two-year assignments.\n\n==== Jezebels ====\nJezebels are women who are forced to become prostitutes and entertainers. They are available only to the Commanders and to their guests. Offred portrays Jezebels as attractive and educated; they may be unsuitable as handmaids due to temperament. They have been sterilized, a surgery that is forbidden to other women. They operate in unofficial but state-sanctioned brothels, unknown to most women. Jezebels, whose title also comes from the Bible (note Queen [[Jezebel]] in the [[Books of Kings]]), dress in the remnants of sexualized costumes from \"the time before\", such as cheerleaders' costumes, school uniforms, and [[Playboy Bunny]] costumes. Jezebels can wear make-up, drink alcohol and socialize with men, but are tightly controlled by the Aunts. When they pass their sexual prime and/or their looks fade, they are discarded without any precision as to whether they are killed or sent to the Colonies in the novel.\n\n===Race analysis===\n[[African Americans]], the main non-white ethnic group in this society, are called the [[Hamitic|Children of Ham]]. A state TV broadcast mentions they have been relocated \"en masse\" to \"National Homelands\" in the Midwest, which are suggestive of the [[Bantustan|Apartheid-era homelands]] set up by South Africa. Ana Cottle characterized ''The Handmaid's Tale'' as \"[[white feminism]]\", noting that Atwood does away with black people in a few lines by relocating the \"Children of Ham\" while borrowing heavily from the African-American experience and applying it to white women.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/the-establishment/the-handmaids-tale-a-white-feminist-s-dystopia-80da75a40dc5|title=The Handmaid's Tale: A White Feminist Dystopia|last=|first=|date=17 May 2017|website=theestablishment.co|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/06/the-handmaids-tale-greatest-failing-is-how-it-handles-race.html|title=The Handmaid's Tale's Greatest Failing Is How It Handles Race|last=Basti\u00e9n|first=Angelica Jade|date=June 2017|website=Vulture|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref>  \nIt is implied that [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] living in territories under the rule of Gilead are exterminated. [[Jews]] are given a choice between converting to the state religion or being \"repatriated\" to [[Israel]]. However, converts who were subsequently discovered with any symbolic representations or artifacts of [[Judaism]] were executed, and the repatriation scheme was privatized. \nMany argue that readers cannot simply ignore the parallels between racism and sexism within ''The Handmaid's Tale''. Many critics believe that Atwood chooses to erase the black community from the novel by sending them elsewhere in order to make the Republic of Gilead a white society. Scholar Ben Merriman believes that Atwood's portrayal of society in ''The Handmaid's Tale'' mimics that of a society run on black slavery, due to the novel's heavy focuses on \"sexual exploitation, isolation, and compelled ignorance that accompany severe economic and political powerlessness\", which are themes often associated with African-American slavery. Merriman accuses Atwood of purposely failing to acknowledge the parallels between her novel and the African-American experience. In Gilead, Handmaids are forbidden to read or write and the men in charge control access to literacy. In black slavery, African-Americans had restrictions on literacy as well. Additionally, ''The Handmaid's Tale'' is written as an oral narration of Offred's experiences; oral narration is a theme commonly associated with slave narratives.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/A206534450/LitRC?u=wash43584&sid=LitRC&xid=a7ab0743|title=White-washing oppression in atwood's the handmaid's tale.|last=Merriman|first=Ben|date=2009|website=Gale|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Language analysis ===\nIn the novel's fictional fundamentalist society, ''sterile'' is an outlawed word.{{Sfn | Atwood | 1998 | p = 161}} In this society, there is no such thing as a sterile man. In this culture, women are either fruitful or barren, the latter of which are declared to be \"unwomen\" and are sent to the colonies with the rest of the \"unwomen\" to do life-threatening work until their death, which is, on average, three years.\n\nAtwood emphasises how changes in context affect behaviours and attitudes by repeating the phrase \"Context is all\" throughout the novel, establishing this precept as a [[Motif (narrative)|motif]].{{Sfn | Atwood | 1998 | pp = 144, 192}} Playing the game of [[Scrabble]] with her Commander illustrates the key significance of changes in \"context\"; once \"the game of old men and women\", the game became forbidden for women to play and therefore \"desirable\".{{Sfn | Atwood | 1998 | pp = 178\u201379}} Through living in a morally rigid society, Offred has come to perceive the world differently from earlier.

The original version of the Internet Protocol that was first deployed in 1983 in the [[ARPANET]], the predecessor of the Internet, is [[IPv4|Internet Protocol version 4]] (IPv4).\n\nThe rapid [[IPv4 address exhaustion|exhaustion of IPv4 address space]] available for assignment to [[Internet service providers]] and end user organizations by the early 1990s, prompted the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) to explore new technologies to expand the addressing capability in the Internet. The result was a redesign of the Internet Protocol which became eventually known as [[IPv6|Internet Protocol Version 6]] (IPv6) in 1995.<ref name=rfc1883/><ref name=rfc2460/><ref name=rfc8200/>\nIPv6 technology was in various testing stages until the mid-2000s, when commercial production deployment commenced.\n\nToday, these two versions of the Internet Protocol are in simultaneous use. Among other technical changes, each version defines the format of addresses differently.  Because of the historical prevalence of IPv4, the generic term ''IP address'' typically still refers to the addresses defined by IPv4. The gap in version sequence between IPv4 and IPv6 resulted from the assignment of version 5 to the experimental [[Internet Stream Protocol]] in 1979, which however was never referred to as IPv5.\n\nOther versions v1 to v9 were defined, but only v4 and v6 ever gained widespread use. v1 and v2 were names for TCP protocols in 1974 and 1977, as there was to separate IP specification at the time. v3 was defined in 1978, and v3.1 is the first version where TCP is separated from IP. v6 is a synthesis of several suggested versions, v6 ''Simple Internet Protocol'', v7 ''TP/IX: The Next Internet'', v8 ''PIP \u2014 The P Internet Protocol'', and v9 ''TUBA \u2014 Tcp & Udp with Big Addresses''.<ref name=\"delong2017\">{{cite web |last1=DeLong |first1=Owen |title=Why does IP have versions?

For this purpose, an IP address is recognized as consisting of two parts: the ''network prefix'' in the high-order bits and the remaining bits called the ''rest field'', ''host identifier'', or ''interface identifier'' (IPv6), used for host numbering within a network.<ref name=rfc760 /> The [[subnet mask]] or CIDR notation determines how the IP address is divided into network and host parts.\n\nThe term ''subnet mask'' is only used within IPv4. Both IP versions however use the CIDR concept and notation. In this, the IP address is followed by a slash and the number (in decimal) of bits used for the network part, also called the ''routing prefix''. For example, an IPv4 address and its subnet mask may be {{IPaddr|192.0.2.1}} and {{IPaddr|255.255.255.0}}, respectively. The CIDR notation for the same IP address and subnet is {{IPaddr|192.0.2.1|24}}, because the first 24 bits of the IP address indicate the network and subnet.\n\n==IPv4 addresses==\n{{Main|IPv4#Addressing}}\n[[Image:Ipv4 address.svg|right|300px|thumb|Decomposition of an IPv4 address from [[dot-decimal notation]] to its binary value.]]\nAn IPv4 address has a size of 32 bits, which limits the [[address space]] to {{gaps|4|294|967|296}} (2<sup>32</sup>) addresses. Of this number, some addresses are reserved for special purposes such as [[private network]]s (~18 million addresses) and [[multicast address]]ing (~270 million addresses).\n\nIPv4 addresses are usually represented in [[dot-decimal notation]], consisting of four decimal numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by dots, e.g., {{IPaddr|172.16.254.1}}.  Each part represents a group of 8 bits (an [[Octet (computing)|octet]]) of the address. In some cases of technical writing,{{specify|date=May 2018}} IPv4 addresses may be presented in various [[hexadecimal]], [[octal]], or [[binary numeral system|binary]] representations.\n\n===Subnetting history===\nIn the early stages of development of the Internet Protocol, the network number was always the highest order octet (most significant eight bits). Because this method allowed for only 256 networks, it soon proved inadequate as additional networks developed that were independent of the existing networks already designated by a network number. In 1981, the addressing specification was revised with the introduction of [[classful network]] architecture.<ref name=rfc791/>\n\nClassful network design allowed for a larger number of individual network assignments and fine-grained [[subnetwork]] design. The first three bits of the most significant octet of an IP address were defined as the ''class'' of the address. Three classes (''A'', ''B'', and ''C'') were defined for universal [[unicast]] addressing. Depending on the class derived, the network identification was based on octet boundary segments of the entire address. Each class used successively additional octets in the network identifier, thus reducing the possible number of hosts in the higher order classes (''B'' and ''C''). The following table gives an overview of this now obsolete system.\n<!-- PLEASE DO NOT MODIFY THIS TABLE BECAUSE YOU THINK IT IS WRONG. It has been checked by knowledgeable editors for correctness within the intended purpose in this article.

The class system of the address space was replaced with [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) in 1993. CIDR is based on variable-length subnet masking (VLSM) to allow allocation and routing based on arbitrary-length prefixes. Today, remnants of classful network concepts function only in a limited scope as the default configuration parameters of some network software and hardware components (e.g. netmask), and in the technical jargon used in network administrators' discussions.\n\n===Private addresses===\nEarly network design, when global end-to-end connectivity was envisioned for communications with all Internet hosts, intended that IP addresses be globally unique. However, it was found that this was not always necessary as private networks developed and public address space needed to be conserved.\n\nComputers not connected to the Internet, such as factory machines that communicate only with each other via TCP/IP, need not have globally unique IP addresses. Today, such private networks are widely used and typically connect to the Internet with [[network address translation]] (NAT), when needed.\n\nThree non-overlapping ranges of IPv4 addresses for private networks are reserved.<ref name=rfc1918>{{Cite IETF|rfc=1918|bcp=5|title=Address Allocation for Private Internets|author1=Y. Rekhter|author2=B. Moskowitz|author3=D. Karrenberg|author4=G. J. de Groot|author5=E. Lear|date=February 1996|publisher=Network Working Group}} Updated by {{IETF RFC|6761}}.</ref> These addresses are not routed on the Internet and thus their use need not be coordinated with an IP address registry. Any user may use any of the reserved blocks. Typically, a network administrator will divide a block into [[subnetwork|subnets]]; for example, many [[residential gateway|home routers]] automatically use a default address range of {{IPaddr|192.168.0.0}} through {{IPaddr|192.168.0.255}} ({{IPaddr|192.168.0.0|24}}).\n{{trim|{{#section:IPv4|IPv4-private-networks}}}}\n\n==IPv6 addresses==\n{{Main|IPv6 address}}\n[[Image:Ipv6 address.svg|right|300px|thumb|Decomposition of an IPv6 address from [[hexadecimal]] representation to its binary value.]]\n\nIn IPv6, the address size was increased from 32 bits in IPv4 to 128 bits, thus providing up to 2<sup>128</sup> (approximately {{val|3.403|e=38}}) addresses. This is deemed sufficient for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe intent of the new design was not to provide just a sufficient quantity of addresses, but also redesign routing in the Internet by allowing more efficient aggregation of subnetwork routing prefixes. This resulted in slower growth of [[routing table]]s in routers. The smallest possible individual allocation is a subnet for 2<sup>64</sup> hosts, which is the square of the size of the entire IPv4 Internet. At these levels, actual address utilization ratios will be small on any IPv6 network segment. The new design also provides the opportunity to separate the addressing infrastructure of a network segment, i.e. the local administration of the segment's available space, from the addressing prefix used to route traffic to and from external networks. IPv6 has facilities that automatically change the routing prefix of entire networks, should the global connectivity or the routing policy change, without requiring internal redesign or manual renumbering.\n\nThe large number of IPv6 addresses allows large blocks to be assigned for specific purposes and, where appropriate, to be aggregated for efficient routing. With a large address space, there is no need to have complex address conservation methods as used in CIDR.\n\nAll modern desktop and enterprise server operating systems include native support for the IPv6 protocol, but it is not yet widely deployed in other devices, such as residential networking routers, [[voice over IP]] (VoIP) and multimedia equipment, and some [[networking hardware]].\n\n===Private addresses===\nJust as IPv4 reserves addresses for private networks, blocks of addresses are set aside in IPv6. In IPv6, these are referred to as [[unique local address]]es (ULAs). The routing prefix {{IPaddr|fc00::|7}} is reserved for this block,<ref name=rfc4193>{{Cite IETF|rfc=4193|title=Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses|author1=R. Hinden|author2=B. Haberman|date=October 2005|publisher=Network Working Group}}</ref> which is divided into two {{IPaddr||8}} blocks with different implied policies. The addresses include a 40-bit [[Pseudorandomness|pseudorandom]] number that minimizes the risk of address collisions if sites merge or packets are misrouted.\n\nEarly practices used a different block for this purpose ({{IPaddr|fec0::}}), dubbed site-local addresses.<ref name=rfc3513>{{Cite IETF|rfc=3513|title=Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Addressing Architecture|author1=R.

Deering|date=April 2003|publisher=Network Working Group}} Obsoleted by {{IETF RFC|4291}}.</ref> However, the definition of what constituted a ''site'' remained unclear and the poorly defined addressing policy created ambiguities for routing. This address type was abandoned and must not be used in new systems.<ref name=rfc3879>{{Cite IETF|rfc=3879|title=Deprecating Site Local Addresses|author1=C. Huitema |author2=B. Carpenter|date=September 2004|publisher=Network Working Group}}</ref>\n\nAddresses starting with {{IPaddr|fe80::}}, called [[link-local address]]es, are assigned to interfaces for communication on the attached link. The addresses are automatically generated by the operating system for each network interface. This provides instant and automatic communication between all IPv6 host on a link. This feature is used in the lower layers of IPv6 network administration, such as for the [[Neighbor Discovery Protocol]].\n\nPrivate and link-local address prefixes may not be routed on the public Internet.\n\n==IP address assignment {{anchor|Dynamic IP|Static IP}}== <!-- redirect target from [[Dynamic IP]] and [[Static IP]] -->\nIP addresses are assigned to a host either dynamically as they join the network, or persistently by configuration of the host hardware or software. Persistent configuration is also known as using a '''static IP address'''. In contrast, when a computer's IP address is assigned each time it restarts, this is known as using a '''dynamic IP address'''.\n\nDynamic IP addresses are assigned by network using [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol]] (DHCP). DHCP is the most frequently used technology for assigning addresses. It avoids the administrative burden of assigning specific static addresses to each device on a network. It also allows devices to share the limited address space on a network if only some of them are online at a particular time. Typically, dynamic IP configuration is enabled by default in modern desktop operating systems.\n\nThe address assigned with DHCP is associated with a ''lease'' and usually has an expiration period. If the lease is not renewed by the host before expiry, the address may be assigned to another device. Some DHCP implementations attempt to reassign the same IP address to a host (based on its MAC address) each time it joins the network. A network administrator may configure DHCP by allocating specific IP addresses based on MAC address.\n\nDHCP is not the only technology used to assign IP addresses dynamically. [[Bootstrap Protocol]] is a similar protocol and predecessor to DHCP. Dialup and some broadband networks use dynamic address features of the [[Point-to-Point Protocol]].\n\nComputers and equipment used for the network infrastructure, such as routers and mail servers, are typically configured with static addressing.\n\nIn the absence or failure of static or dynamic address configurations, an operating system may assign a [[link-local address]] to a host using stateless address autoconfiguration.\n\n===Sticky dynamic IP address {{anchor|Sticky dynamic IP address}}===\n<!-- redirect target from [[Sticky dynamic IP address]] and [[Sticky IP]] -->\nA ''sticky dynamic IP address'' is an informal term used by cable and DSL Internet access subscribers to describe a dynamically assigned IP address which seldom changes. The addresses are usually assigned with DHCP. Since the modems are usually powered on for extended periods of time, the address leases are usually set to long periods and simply renewed. If a modem is turned off and powered up again before the next expiration of the address lease, it often receives the same IP address.\n\n===Address autoconfiguration=== \nAddress block {{IPaddr|169.254.0.0|16}} is defined for the special use in link-local addressing for IPv4 networks.<ref name=rfc6890>{{Cite IETF|rfc=6890|bcp=153|title=Special-Purpose IP Address Registries|author1=M. Cotton|author2=L. Vegoda|author3=R. Bonica|author4=B. Haberman|date=April 2013|publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force]]}} Updated by {{IETF RFC|8190}}.</ref> In IPv6, every interface, whether using static or dynamic address assignments, also receives a link-local address automatically in the block {{IPaddr|fe80::|10}}.<ref name=rfc6890 /> These addresses are only valid on the link, such as a local network segment or point-to-point connection, to which a host is connected. These addresses are not routable and, like private addresses, cannot be the source or destination of packets traversing the Internet.\n\nWhen the link-local IPv4 address block was reserved, no standards existed for mechanisms of address autoconfiguration. Filling the void, [[Microsoft]] developed a protocol called [[Automatic Private IP Addressing]] (APIPA), whose first public implementation appeared in [[Windows 98]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-2000-server/cc958957(v%3dtechnet.10)|title=DHCP and Automatic Private IP Addressing|website=docs.microsoft.com|language=en-us|access-date=2019-05-20}}</ref> APIPA has been deployed on millions of machines and became a [[de facto standard]] in the industry.

A second assignment of an address generally stops the IP functionality of one or both of the devices.  Many modern [[operating system]]s notify the administrator of IP address conflicts.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd379838(v=ws.10).aspx\n |title       = Event ID 4198 \u2014 TCP/IP Network Interface Configuration\n |access-date  = 2 June 2013\n |date        = 7 January 2009\n |publisher   = [[Microsoft]]\n |url-status     = live\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131224215139/http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd379838(v=ws.10).aspx\n |archive-date = 24 December 2013\n |df          = dmy-all\n}} \"Updated: January 7, 2009\"</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url         = https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd379922(v=ws.10).aspx\n |title       = Event ID 4199 \u2014 TCP/IP Network Interface Configuration\n |access-date  = 2 June 2013\n |date        = 7 January 2009\n |publisher   = [[Microsoft]]\n |url-status     = live\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131222151743/http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd379922(v=ws.10).aspx\n |archive-date = 22 December 2013\n |df          = dmy-all\n}} \"Updated: 7 January 2009\"</ref> When IP addresses are assigned by multiple people and systems with differing methods, any of them may be at fault.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://compnetworking.about.com/od/workingwithipaddresses/f/ip_conflict.htm\n |title       = IP Address Conflicts \u2013 What Is an IP Address Conflict?\n |author      = Mitchell, Bradley\n |authorlink  = \n |access-date  = 23 November 2013\n |date        = \n |publisher   = [[About.com]]\n |url-status     = live\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20140413194343/http://compnetworking.about.com/od/workingwithipaddresses/f/ip_conflict.htm\n |archive-date = 13 April 2014\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.online-tech-tips.com/computer-tips/ip-address-already-in-use/\n |title       = How to Fix an IP Address Conflict\n |author      = Kishore, Aseem\n |authorlink  = \n |access-date  = 23 November 2013\n |date        = 4 August 2009\n |publisher   = Online Tech Tips Online-tech-tips.com\n |url-status     = live\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130825040120/http://www.online-tech-tips.com/computer-tips/ip-address-already-in-use/\n |archive-date = 25 August 2013\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/get-help-with-there-is-an-ip-address-conflict-message\n |title       = Get help with &quot;There is an IP address conflict&quot; message\n |author      = \n |authorlink  = \n |access-date  = 23 November 2013\n |date        = 22 November 2013\n |publisher   = [[Microsoft]]\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130926071157/http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/get-help-with-there-is-an-ip-address-conflict-message\n |archive-date = 26 September 2013\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q133490\n |title       = Fix duplicate IP address conflicts on a DHCP network\n |author      = \n |authorlink  = \n |access-date  = 23 November 2013\n |date        = \n |publisher   = [[Microsoft]]\n |url-status     = live\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20141228223206/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q133490\n |archive-date = 28 December 2014\n |df          = dmy-all\n}} Article ID: 133490 \u2013 Last Review: 15 October 2013 \u2013 Revision: 5.0</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Internet/2007/IP_Address_Conflicts.asp\n |title       = Understanding And Resolving IP Address Conflicts - Webopedia.com\n |author      = Moran, Joseph\n |authorlink  = \n |access-date  = 23 November 2013\n |date        = 1 September 2010\n |publisher   = Webopedia.com\n |url-status     = live\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131002155215/http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Internet/2007/IP_Address_Conflicts.asp\n |archive-date = 2 October 2013\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> If one of the devices involved in the conflict is the [[default gateway]] access beyond the LAN for all devices on the LAN may be impaired.\n\n==Routing==\nIP addresses are classified into several classes of operational characteristics: unicast, multicast, anycast and broadcast addressing.\n\n===Unicast addressing===\nThe most common concept of an IP address is in [[unicast]] addressing, available in both IPv4 and IPv6. It normally refers to a single sender or a single receiver, and can be used for both sending and receiving. Usually, a unicast address is associated with a single device or host, but a device or host may have more than one unicast address. Sending the same data to multiple unicast addresses requires the sender to send all the data many times over, once for each recipient.\n\n===Broadcast addressing===\n[[Broadcasting (computing)|Broadcasting]] is an addressing technique available in IPv4 to address data to all possible destinations on a network in one transmission operation as an ''all-hosts broadcast''. All receivers capture the network packet. The address {{IPaddr|255.255.255.255}} is used for network broadcast. In addition, a more limited directed broadcast uses the all-ones host address with the network prefix. For example, the destination address used for directed broadcast to devices on the network {{IPaddr|192.0.2.0|24}} is {{IPaddr|192.0.2.255}}.\n\nIPv6 does not implement broadcast addressing, and replaces it with multicast to the specially defined all-nodes multicast address.\n\n===Multicast addressing===\nA [[multicast address]] is associated with a group of interested receivers. In IPv4, addresses {{IPaddr|224.0.0.0}} through {{IPaddr|239.255.255.255}} (the former [[Classful network|Class D]] addresses) are designated as multicast addresses.<ref name=rfc5771>{{Cite IETF|rfc=5771|bcp=51|title=IANA Guidelines for IPv4 Multicast Address Assignments|author1=M. Cotton|author2=L. Vegoda|author3=D. Meyer|date=March 2010|publisher=[[IETF]]|issn=2070-1721}}</ref> IPv6 uses the address block with the prefix {{IPaddr|ff00::|8}} for multicast. In either case, the sender sends a single datagram from its unicast address to the multicast group address and the intermediary routers take care of making copies and sending them to all interested receivers (those that have joined the corresponding multicast group).\n\n===Anycast addressing===\nLike broadcast and multicast, [[anycast]] is a one-to-many routing topology. However, the data stream is not transmitted to all receivers, just the one which the router decides is closest in the network. Anycast addressing is an built-in feature of IPv6.<ref>{{IETF RFC|2526}}</ref><ref>{{IETF RFC|4291}}</ref>  In IPv4, anycast addressing is implemented with [[Border Gateway Protocol]] using the shortest-path [[Metrics (networking)|metric]] to choose destinations. Anycast methods are useful for global load balancing and are commonly used in distributed [[Domain name system|DNS]] systems.\n\n==Geolocation==\nA host may use [[geolocation software]] to deduce the location of its communicating peer.\n\n=={{visible anchor|Public address}}==\nA public IP address, in common parlance, is a globally routable unicast IP address, meaning that the address is not an address reserved for use in [[private network]]s, such as those reserved by {{IETF RFC|1918}}, or the various IPv6 address formats of local scope or site-local scope, for example for link-local addressing. Public IP addresses may be used for communication between hosts on the global Internet.\n\n==Firewalling==\nFor security and privacy considerations, network administrators often desire to restrict public Internet traffic within their private networks. The source and destination IP addresses contained in the headers of each IP packet are a convenient means to discriminate traffic by [[IP address blocking]] or by selectively tailoring responses to external requests to internal servers. This is achieved with [[Firewall (computer)|firewall]] software running on the network's gateway router.  A database of IP addresses of restricted and permissible traffic may be maintained in [[blacklist (computing)|blacklists]] and [[whitelist]]s respectively.\n\n==Address translation==\nMultiple client devices can appear to {{anchor|shared_IP}}share an IP address, either because they are part of a [[shared web hosting service]] environment or because an IPv4 [[network address translator]] (NAT) or [[proxy server]] acts as an [[intermediary]] agent on behalf of the client, in which case the real originating IP address is masked from the server receiving a request. A common practice is to have a NAT mask many devices in a private network. Only the public interface(s) of the NAT needs to have an Internet-routable address.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n |last        = Comer\n |first       = Douglas\n |title       = Internetworking with TCP/IP:Principles, Protocols, and Architectures \u2013 4th ed.\n |publisher   = Prentice Hall\n |year        = 2000\n |location    = Upper Saddle River, NJ\n |url         = http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dec/netbooks.html\n |isbn        = 978-0-13-018380-4\n |page        = 394\n |url-status     = live\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100413232359/http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dec/netbooks.html\n |archive-date = 13 April 2010\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nThe NAT device maps different IP addresses on the private network to different TCP or UDP [[port number]]s on the public network. In residential networks, NAT functions are usually implemented in a [[residential gateway]].

The size of the routing prefix of the address is designated in [[CIDR notation]] by suffixing the address with the number of significant bits, e.g., {{IPaddr|192.168.1.15|24}}, which is equivalent to the historically used subnet mask {{IPaddr|255.255.255.0}}.\n\nThe IP address space is managed globally by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA), and by five [[Regional Internet registry|regional Internet registries]] (RIRs) responsible in their designated territories for assignment to [[local Internet registry|local Internet registries]], such as [[Internet service providers]], and other end users. IPv4 addresses were distributed by IANA to the RIRs in blocks of approximately 16.8&nbsp;million addresses each, but have been exhausted at the IANA level since 2011. Only one of the RIRs still has a supply for local assignments in Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ipv4.potaroo.net/|title=IPv4 Address Report}}</ref> Some IPv4 addresses are reserved for [[private network]]s and are not globally unique.\n\nNetwork administrators assign an IP address to each device connected to a network. Such assignments may be on a ''static'' (fixed or permanent) or ''dynamic'' basis, depending on network practices and software features.\n\n==Function==\nAn IP address serves two principal functions. It [[Identification (information)|identifies]] the host, or more specifically its network interface, and it provides the location of the host in the network, and thus the capability of establishing a path to that host. Its role has been characterized as follows: \"A name indicates what we seek. An address indicates where it is. A route indicates how to get there.\"<ref name=rfc791/>\nThe [[Header (computing)|header]] of each [[Network packet|IP packet]] contains the IP address of the sending host, and that of the destination host.\n\n==IP versions==\nTwo [[Internet Protocol#Version history|versions of the Internet Protocol]] are in common use in the Internet today. The original version of the Internet Protocol that was first deployed in 1983 in the [[ARPANET]], the predecessor of the Internet, is [[IPv4|Internet Protocol version 4]] (IPv4).\n\nThe rapid [[IPv4 address exhaustion|exhaustion of IPv4 address space]] available for assignment to [[Internet service providers]] and end user organizations by the early 1990s, prompted the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) to explore new technologies to expand the addressing capability in the Internet. The result was a redesign of the Internet Protocol which became eventually known as [[IPv6|Internet Protocol Version 6]] (IPv6) in 1995.<ref name=rfc1883/><ref name=rfc2460/><ref name=rfc8200/>\nIPv6 technology was in various testing stages until the mid-2000s, when commercial production deployment commenced.\n\nToday, these two versions of the Internet Protocol are in simultaneous use. Among other technical changes, each version defines the format of addresses differently.  Because of the historical prevalence of IPv4, the generic term ''IP address'' typically still refers to the addresses defined by IPv4. The gap in version sequence between IPv4 and IPv6 resulted from the assignment of version 5 to the experimental [[Internet Stream Protocol]] in 1979, which however was never referred to as IPv5.\n\nOther versions v1 to v9 were defined, but only v4 and v6 ever gained widespread use. v1 and v2 were names for TCP protocols in 1974 and 1977, as there was to separate IP specification at the time. v3 was defined in 1978, and v3.1 is the first version where TCP is separated from IP. v6 is a synthesis of several suggested versions, v6 ''Simple Internet Protocol'', v7 ''TP/IX: The Next Internet'', v8 ''PIP \u2014 The P Internet Protocol'', and v9 ''TUBA \u2014 Tcp & Udp with Big Addresses''.<ref name=\"delong2017\">{{cite web |last1=DeLong |first1=Owen |title=Why does IP have versions?

For this purpose, an IP address is recognized as consisting of two parts: the ''network prefix'' in the high-order bits and the remaining bits called the ''rest field'', ''host identifier'', or ''interface identifier'' (IPv6), used for host numbering within a network.<ref name=rfc760 /> The [[subnet mask]] or CIDR notation determines how the IP address is divided into network and host parts.\n\nThe term ''subnet mask'' is only used within IPv4. Both IP versions however use the CIDR concept and notation. In this, the IP address is followed by a slash and the number (in decimal) of bits used for the network part, also called the ''routing prefix''. For example, an IPv4 address and its subnet mask may be {{IPaddr|192.0.2.1}} and {{IPaddr|255.255.255.0}}, respectively. The CIDR notation for the same IP address and subnet is {{IPaddr|192.0.2.1|24}}, because the first 24 bits of the IP address indicate the network and subnet.\n\n==IPv4 addresses==\n{{Main|IPv4#Addressing}}\n[[Image:Ipv4 address.svg|right|300px|thumb|Decomposition of an IPv4 address from [[dot-decimal notation]] to its binary value.]]\nAn IPv4 address has a size of 32 bits, which limits the [[address space]] to {{gaps|4|294|967|296}} (2<sup>32</sup>) addresses. Of this number, some addresses are reserved for special purposes such as [[private network]]s (~18 million addresses) and [[multicast address]]ing (~270 million addresses).\n\nIPv4 addresses are usually represented in [[dot-decimal notation]], consisting of four decimal numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by dots, e.g., {{IPaddr|172.16.254.1}}.  Each part represents a group of 8 bits (an [[Octet (computing)|octet]]) of the address. In some cases of technical writing,{{specify|date=May 2018}} IPv4 addresses may be presented in various [[hexadecimal]], [[octal]], or [[binary numeral system|binary]] representations.\n\n===Subnetting history===\nIn the early stages of development of the Internet Protocol, the network number was always the highest order octet (most significant eight bits). Because this method allowed for only 256 networks, it soon proved inadequate as additional networks developed that were independent of the existing networks already designated by a network number. In 1981, the addressing specification was revised with the introduction of [[classful network]] architecture.<ref name=rfc791/>\n\nClassful network design allowed for a larger number of individual network assignments and fine-grained [[subnetwork]] design. The first three bits of the most significant octet of an IP address were defined as the ''class'' of the address. Three classes (''A'', ''B'', and ''C'') were defined for universal [[unicast]] addressing. Depending on the class derived, the network identification was based on octet boundary segments of the entire address. Each class used successively additional octets in the network identifier, thus reducing the possible number of hosts in the higher order classes (''B'' and ''C''). The following table gives an overview of this now obsolete system.\n<!-- PLEASE DO NOT MODIFY THIS TABLE BECAUSE YOU THINK IT IS WRONG.

The class system of the address space was replaced with [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) in 1993. CIDR is based on variable-length subnet masking (VLSM) to allow allocation and routing based on arbitrary-length prefixes. Today, remnants of classful network concepts function only in a limited scope as the default configuration parameters of some network software and hardware components (e.g. netmask), and in the technical jargon used in network administrators' discussions.\n\n===Private addresses===\nEarly network design, when global end-to-end connectivity was envisioned for communications with all Internet hosts, intended that IP addresses be globally unique. However, it was found that this was not always necessary as private networks developed and public address space needed to be conserved.\n\nComputers not connected to the Internet, such as factory machines that communicate only with each other via TCP/IP, need not have globally unique IP addresses. Today, such private networks are widely used and typically connect to the Internet with [[network address translation]] (NAT), when needed.\n\nThree non-overlapping ranges of IPv4 addresses for private networks are reserved.<ref name=rfc1918>{{Cite IETF|rfc=1918|bcp=5|title=Address Allocation for Private Internets|author1=Y. Rekhter|author2=B. Moskowitz|author3=D. Karrenberg|author4=G. J. de Groot|author5=E. Lear|date=February 1996|publisher=Network Working Group}} Updated by {{IETF RFC|6761}}.</ref> These addresses are not routed on the Internet and thus their use need not be coordinated with an IP address registry. Any user may use any of the reserved blocks. Typically, a network administrator will divide a block into [[subnetwork|subnets]]; for example, many [[residential gateway|home routers]] automatically use a default address range of {{IPaddr|192.168.0.0}} through {{IPaddr|192.168.0.255}} ({{IPaddr|192.168.0.0|24}}).\n{{trim|{{#section:IPv4|IPv4-private-networks}}}}\n\n==IPv6 addresses==\n{{Main|IPv6 address}}\n[[Image:Ipv6 address.svg|right|300px|thumb|Decomposition of an IPv6 address from [[hexadecimal]] representation to its binary value.]]\n\nIn IPv6, the address size was increased from 32 bits in IPv4 to 128 bits, thus providing up to 2<sup>128</sup> (approximately {{val|3.403|e=38}}) addresses. This is deemed sufficient for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe intent of the new design was not to provide just a sufficient quantity of addresses, but also redesign routing in the Internet by allowing more efficient aggregation of subnetwork routing prefixes. This resulted in slower growth of [[routing table]]s in routers. The smallest possible individual allocation is a subnet for 2<sup>64</sup> hosts, which is the square of the size of the entire IPv4 Internet. At these levels, actual address utilization ratios will be small on any IPv6 network segment. The new design also provides the opportunity to separate the addressing infrastructure of a network segment, i.e. the local administration of the segment's available space, from the addressing prefix used to route traffic to and from external networks. IPv6 has facilities that automatically change the routing prefix of entire networks, should the global connectivity or the routing policy change, without requiring internal redesign or manual renumbering.\n\nThe large number of IPv6 addresses allows large blocks to be assigned for specific purposes and, where appropriate, to be aggregated for efficient routing. With a large address space, there is no need to have complex address conservation methods as used in CIDR.\n\nAll modern desktop and enterprise server operating systems include native support for the IPv6 protocol, but it is not yet widely deployed in other devices, such as residential networking routers, [[voice over IP]] (VoIP) and multimedia equipment, and some [[networking hardware]].\n\n===Private addresses===\nJust as IPv4 reserves addresses for private networks, blocks of addresses are set aside in IPv6. In IPv6, these are referred to as [[unique local address]]es (ULAs). The routing prefix {{IPaddr|fc00::|7}} is reserved for this block,<ref name=rfc4193>{{Cite IETF|rfc=4193|title=Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses|author1=R. Hinden|author2=B. Haberman|date=October 2005|publisher=Network Working Group}}</ref> which is divided into two {{IPaddr||8}} blocks with different implied policies. The addresses include a 40-bit [[Pseudorandomness|pseudorandom]] number that minimizes the risk of address collisions if sites merge or packets are misrouted.\n\nEarly practices used a different block for this purpose ({{IPaddr|fec0::}}), dubbed site-local addresses.<ref name=rfc3513>{{Cite IETF|rfc=3513|title=Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Addressing Architecture|author1=R. Hinden |authorlink2=Steve Deering|author2=S. Deering|date=April 2003|publisher=Network Working Group}} Obsoleted by {{IETF RFC|4291}}.</ref> However, the definition of what constituted a ''site'' remained unclear and the poorly defined addressing policy created ambiguities for routing. This address type was abandoned and must not be used in new systems.<ref name=rfc3879>{{Cite IETF|rfc=3879|title=Deprecating Site Local Addresses|author1=C. Huitema |author2=B. Carpenter|date=September 2004|publisher=Network Working Group}}</ref>\n\nAddresses starting with {{IPaddr|fe80::}}, called [[link-local address]]es, are assigned to interfaces for communication on the attached link. The addresses are automatically generated by the operating system for each network interface. This provides instant and automatic communication between all IPv6 host on a link. This feature is used in the lower layers of IPv6 network administration, such as for the [[Neighbor Discovery Protocol]].\n\nPrivate and link-local address prefixes may not be routed on the public Internet.\n\n==IP address assignment {{anchor|Dynamic IP|Static IP}}== <!-- redirect target from [[Dynamic IP]] and [[Static IP]] -->\nIP addresses are assigned to a host either dynamically as they join the network, or persistently by configuration of the host hardware or software. Persistent configuration is also known as using a '''static IP address'''. In contrast, when a computer's IP address is assigned each time it restarts, this is known as using a '''dynamic IP address'''.\n\nDynamic IP addresses are assigned by network using [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol]] (DHCP). DHCP is the most frequently used technology for assigning addresses. It avoids the administrative burden of assigning specific static addresses to each device on a network. It also allows devices to share the limited address space on a network if only some of them are online at a particular time. Typically, dynamic IP configuration is enabled by default in modern desktop operating systems.\n\nThe address assigned with DHCP is associated with a ''lease'' and usually has an expiration period. If the lease is not renewed by the host before expiry, the address may be assigned to another device. Some DHCP implementations attempt to reassign the same IP address to a host (based on its MAC address) each time it joins the network. A network administrator may configure DHCP by allocating specific IP addresses based on MAC address.\n\nDHCP is not the only technology used to assign IP addresses dynamically. [[Bootstrap Protocol]] is a similar protocol and predecessor to DHCP. Dialup and some broadband networks use dynamic address features of the [[Point-to-Point Protocol]].\n\nComputers and equipment used for the network infrastructure, such as routers and mail servers, are typically configured with static addressing.\n\nIn the absence or failure of static or dynamic address configurations, an operating system may assign a [[link-local address]] to a host using stateless address autoconfiguration.\n\n===Sticky dynamic IP address {{anchor|Sticky dynamic IP address}}===\n<!-- redirect target from [[Sticky dynamic IP address]] and [[Sticky IP]] -->\nA ''sticky dynamic IP address'' is an informal term used by cable and DSL Internet access subscribers to describe a dynamically assigned IP address which seldom changes. The addresses are usually assigned with DHCP. Since the modems are usually powered on for extended periods of time, the address leases are usually set to long periods and simply renewed. If a modem is turned off and powered up again before the next expiration of the address lease, it often receives the same IP address.\n\n===Address autoconfiguration=== \nAddress block {{IPaddr|169.254.0.0|16}} is defined for the special use in link-local addressing for IPv4 networks.<ref name=rfc6890>{{Cite IETF|rfc=6890|bcp=153|title=Special-Purpose IP Address Registries|author1=M. Cotton|author2=L. Vegoda|author3=R. Bonica|author4=B. Haberman|date=April 2013|publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force]]}} Updated by {{IETF RFC|8190}}.</ref> In IPv6, every interface, whether using static or dynamic address assignments, also receives a link-local address automatically in the block {{IPaddr|fe80::|10}}.<ref name=rfc6890 /> These addresses are only valid on the link, such as a local network segment or point-to-point connection, to which a host is connected. These addresses are not routable and, like private addresses, cannot be the source or destination of packets traversing the Internet.\n\nWhen the link-local IPv4 address block was reserved, no standards existed for mechanisms of address autoconfiguration. Filling the void, [[Microsoft]] developed a protocol called [[Automatic Private IP Addressing]] (APIPA), whose first public implementation appeared in [[Windows 98]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-2000-server/cc958957(v%3dtechnet.10)|title=DHCP and Automatic Private IP Addressing|website=docs.microsoft.com|language=en-us|access-date=2019-05-20}}</ref> APIPA has been deployed on millions of machines and became a [[de facto standard]] in the industry.

A second assignment of an address generally stops the IP functionality of one or both of the devices.  Many modern [[operating system]]s notify the administrator of IP address conflicts.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd379838(v=ws.10).aspx\n |title       = Event ID 4198 \u2014 TCP/IP Network Interface Configuration\n |access-date  = 2 June 2013\n |date        = 7 January 2009\n |publisher   = [[Microsoft]]\n |url-status     = live\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131224215139/http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd379838(v=ws.10).aspx\n |archive-date = 24 December 2013\n |df          = dmy-all\n}} \"Updated: January 7, 2009\"</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url         = https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd379922(v=ws.10).aspx\n |title       = Event ID 4199 \u2014 TCP/IP Network Interface Configuration\n |access-date  = 2 June 2013\n |date        = 7 January 2009\n |publisher   = [[Microsoft]]\n |url-status     = live\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131222151743/http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd379922(v=ws.10).aspx\n |archive-date = 22 December 2013\n |df          = dmy-all\n}} \"Updated: 7 January 2009\"</ref> When IP addresses are assigned by multiple people and systems with differing methods, any of them may be at fault.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://compnetworking.about.com/od/workingwithipaddresses/f/ip_conflict.htm\n |title       = IP Address Conflicts \u2013 What Is an IP Address Conflict?\n |author      = Mitchell, Bradley\n |authorlink  = \n |access-date  = 23 November 2013\n |date        = \n |publisher   = [[About.com]]\n |url-status     = live\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20140413194343/http://compnetworking.about.com/od/workingwithipaddresses/f/ip_conflict.htm\n |archive-date = 13 April 2014\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.online-tech-tips.com/computer-tips/ip-address-already-in-use/\n |title       = How to Fix an IP Address Conflict\n |author      = Kishore, Aseem\n |authorlink  = \n |access-date  = 23 November 2013\n |date        = 4 August 2009\n |publisher   = Online Tech Tips Online-tech-tips.com\n |url-status     = live\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130825040120/http://www.online-tech-tips.com/computer-tips/ip-address-already-in-use/\n |archive-date = 25 August 2013\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/get-help-with-there-is-an-ip-address-conflict-message\n |title       = Get help with &quot;There is an IP address conflict&quot; message\n |author      = \n |authorlink  = \n |access-date  = 23 November 2013\n |date        = 22 November 2013\n |publisher   = [[Microsoft]]\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130926071157/http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/get-help-with-there-is-an-ip-address-conflict-message\n |archive-date = 26 September 2013\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q133490\n |title       = Fix duplicate IP address conflicts on a DHCP network\n |author      = \n |authorlink  = \n |access-date  = 23 November 2013\n |date        = \n |publisher   = [[Microsoft]]\n |url-status     = live\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20141228223206/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q133490\n |archive-date = 28 December 2014\n |df          = dmy-all\n}} Article ID: 133490 \u2013 Last Review: 15 October 2013 \u2013 Revision: 5.0</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Internet/2007/IP_Address_Conflicts.asp\n |title       = Understanding And Resolving IP Address Conflicts - Webopedia.com\n |author      = Moran, Joseph\n |authorlink  = \n |access-date  = 23 November 2013\n |date        = 1 September 2010\n |publisher   = Webopedia.com\n |url-status     = live\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20131002155215/http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Internet/2007/IP_Address_Conflicts.asp\n |archive-date = 2 October 2013\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> If one of the devices involved in the conflict is the [[default gateway]] access beyond the LAN for all devices on the LAN may be impaired.\n\n==Routing==\nIP addresses are classified into several classes of operational characteristics: unicast, multicast, anycast and broadcast addressing.\n\n===Unicast addressing===\nThe most common concept of an IP address is in [[unicast]] addressing, available in both IPv4 and IPv6. It normally refers to a single sender or a single receiver, and can be used for both sending and receiving. Usually, a unicast address is associated with a single device or host, but a device or host may have more than one unicast address. Sending the same data to multiple unicast addresses requires the sender to send all the data many times over, once for each recipient.\n\n===Broadcast addressing===\n[[Broadcasting (computing)|Broadcasting]] is an addressing technique available in IPv4 to address data to all possible destinations on a network in one transmission operation as an ''all-hosts broadcast''. All receivers capture the network packet. The address {{IPaddr|255.255.255.255}} is used for network broadcast. In addition, a more limited directed broadcast uses the all-ones host address with the network prefix. For example, the destination address used for directed broadcast to devices on the network {{IPaddr|192.0.2.0|24}} is {{IPaddr|192.0.2.255}}.\n\nIPv6 does not implement broadcast addressing, and replaces it with multicast to the specially defined all-nodes multicast address.\n\n===Multicast addressing===\nA [[multicast address]] is associated with a group of interested receivers. In IPv4, addresses {{IPaddr|224.0.0.0}} through {{IPaddr|239.255.255.255}} (the former [[Classful network|Class D]] addresses) are designated as multicast addresses.<ref name=rfc5771>{{Cite IETF|rfc=5771|bcp=51|title=IANA Guidelines for IPv4 Multicast Address Assignments|author1=M. Cotton|author2=L. Vegoda|author3=D. Meyer|date=March 2010|publisher=[[IETF]]|issn=2070-1721}}</ref> IPv6 uses the address block with the prefix {{IPaddr|ff00::|8}} for multicast. In either case, the sender sends a single datagram from its unicast address to the multicast group address and the intermediary routers take care of making copies and sending them to all interested receivers (those that have joined the corresponding multicast group).\n\n===Anycast addressing===\nLike broadcast and multicast, [[anycast]] is a one-to-many routing topology. However, the data stream is not transmitted to all receivers, just the one which the router decides is closest in the network. Anycast addressing is an built-in feature of IPv6.<ref>{{IETF RFC|2526}}</ref><ref>{{IETF RFC|4291}}</ref>  In IPv4, anycast addressing is implemented with [[Border Gateway Protocol]] using the shortest-path [[Metrics (networking)|metric]] to choose destinations. Anycast methods are useful for global load balancing and are commonly used in distributed [[Domain name system|DNS]] systems.\n\n==Geolocation==\nA host may use [[geolocation software]] to deduce the location of its communicating peer.\n\n=={{visible anchor|Public address}}==\nA public IP address, in common parlance, is a globally routable unicast IP address, meaning that the address is not an address reserved for use in [[private network]]s, such as those reserved by {{IETF RFC|1918}}, or the various IPv6 address formats of local scope or site-local scope, for example for link-local addressing. Public IP addresses may be used for communication between hosts on the global Internet.\n\n==Firewalling==\nFor security and privacy considerations, network administrators often desire to restrict public Internet traffic within their private networks. The source and destination IP addresses contained in the headers of each IP packet are a convenient means to discriminate traffic by [[IP address blocking]] or by selectively tailoring responses to external requests to internal servers. This is achieved with [[Firewall (computer)|firewall]] software running on the network's gateway router.  A database of IP addresses of restricted and permissible traffic may be maintained in [[blacklist (computing)|blacklists]] and [[whitelist]]s respectively.\n\n==Address translation==\nMultiple client devices can appear to {{anchor|shared_IP}}share an IP address, either because they are part of a [[shared web hosting service]] environment or because an IPv4 [[network address translator]] (NAT) or [[proxy server]] acts as an [[intermediary]] agent on behalf of the client, in which case the real originating IP address is masked from the server receiving a request. A common practice is to have a NAT mask many devices in a private network. Only the public interface(s) of the NAT needs to have an Internet-routable address.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n |last        = Comer\n |first       = Douglas\n |title       = Internetworking with TCP/IP:Principles, Protocols, and Architectures \u2013 4th ed.\n |publisher   = Prentice Hall\n |year        = 2000\n |location    = Upper Saddle River, NJ\n |url         = http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dec/netbooks.html\n |isbn        = 978-0-13-018380-4\n |page        = 394\n |url-status     = live\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100413232359/http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dec/netbooks.html\n |archive-date = 13 April 2010\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nThe NAT device maps different IP addresses on the private network to different TCP or UDP [[port number]]s on the public network. In residential networks, NAT functions are usually implemented in a [[residential gateway]]. In this scenario, the computers connected to the router have private IP addresses and the router has a public address on its external interface to communicate on the Internet. The internal computers appear to share one public IP address.<!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]-->\n\n==Diagnostic tools==\nComputer operating systems provide various diagnostic tools to examine network interfaces and address configuration.

{"title_page": "Device fingerprint", "text_new": "A '''device fingerprint''' or ''machine fingerprint'' is information collected about the software and hardware of a remote computing device for the purpose of identification. The information is usually assimilated into a brief identifier using a [[fingerprinting algorithm]]. A '''browser fingerprint''' is information collected specifically by interaction with the [[web browser]] of the device.{{r|1=Laperdrix2016|p1=878|2=Eckersley2010|p2=1}}\n\nDevice fingerprints can be used to fully or partially identify individual devices even when [[persistent cookie]]s (and also [[zombie cookie]]s) can't be read or stored in the browser, the client [[IP address]] is hidden, and even if one switches to another browser on the same device.{{r|yao2017}} \nThis may allow a service provider to detect and prevent [[identity theft]] and [[credit card fraud]],{{r|Alaca2016|p=299|Steinberg2014|infoworld|simility}} but also to compile long-term records of individuals' browsing histories (and deliver [[targeted advertising]]{{r|1=Nikiforakis2015|p1=821|2=Acar2013|p2=9}} or targeted [[exploit (computer security)|exploit]]s{{r|1=Abgrall2012|p1=8|2=Nikiforakis2013|p2=547}}) even when they're attempting to [[Anonymous web browsing|avoid tracking]], raising a major concern for [[internet privacy]] advocates.{{r|eff12ways}}\nSome [[computer security]] experts consider the ease of bulk parameter extraction offered by web browsers to be a [[security hole]].{{r|email}}\n\n==History==\n{{Update|section|date=March 2020}}\nBasic [[web browser]] configuration information has long been collected by [[web analytics]] services in an effort to measure real human [[web traffic]] and discount various forms of [[click fraud]]. And since its introduction in the late 1990s, [[JavaScript|client-side scripting]] has gradually enabled the collection an increasing amount of diverse information.\n\nIn 2005, researchers at [[University of California, San Diego]] showed how [[Transmission Control Protocol| TCP]] timestamps could be used to estimate the [[clock skew]] of a device, and consequently to remotely obtain an hardware fingerprint of the device.{{r|Kohno}}\n\nIn 2010, [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] launched a website where visitors can test their browser fingerprint.{{r|aboutPanop}} After collecting a sample of 470161 fingerprints, they measured at least 18.1 bits of [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] possible from browser fingerprinting,{{r|uniquePanop}} but that was before the advancements of [[canvas fingerprinting]], which claims to add another 5.7 bits.\n\nIn 2012, Keaton Mowery and Hovav Shacham, researchers at [[University of California, San Diego]], showed how the [[HTML5]] [[canvas element]] could be used to create digital fingerprints of web browsers.{{r|Angwin|Mowery2012}}\n\nIn 2013, at least 0.4% of Alexa top 10,000 sites were found to use fingerprinting scripts provided by a few known third parties.{{r|Nikiforakis2013|p=546}}\n\nIn 2014, 5.5% of Alexa top 10,000 sites were found to use canvas fingerprinting scripts served by a total of 20 domains. The overwhelming majority (95%) of the scripts were served by [[AddThis]], which started using canvas fingerprinting in January that year, without the knowledge of some of its clients.{{r|1=Acar2014|p1=678|2=Davis|3=Angwin|4=Knibbs|5=Steinberg2014}}\n\nIn 2015, a feature to protect against browser fingerprinting was introduced in [[Firefox]] version 41,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/issues/7 |title=meta: tor uplift: privacy.resistFingerprinting  |accessdate=2018-07-06}}</ref> but it has been since left in an experimental stage, not initiated by default.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-protection-against-fingerprinting |title=Firefox's protection against fingerprinting |accessdate=2018-07-06}}</ref><br>\nThe same year a feature named ''Enhanced Tracking Protection'' was introduced in Firefox version 42 to protect against tracking during private browsing<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/42.0/releasenotes/|title=Firefox 42.0 release notes}}</ref> by blocking scripts from third party domains found in the lists published by the company Disconnect.\n\nAt [[WWDC 2018]] [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] announced that [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] on [[macOS Mojave]] \"presents simplified system information when users browse the web, preventing them from being tracked based on their system configuration.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/06/apple-introduces-macos-mojave/ |title=Apple introduces macOS Mojave |accessdate=2018-07-06}}</ref><br>\nA 2018 study revealed that only one-third of browser fingerprints in a French database were unique, indicating that browser fingerprinting may become less effective as the number of users increases and web technologies convergently evolve to implement fewer distinguishing features.{{r|G\u00f3mez-Boix2018}}\n\nIn 2019, starting from Firefox version 69, ''Enhanced Tracking Protection'' has been turned always on by default for all users.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/69.0/releasenotes/|title=Firefox 69.0 release notes}}</ref> The feature was first introduced to protect private browsing in 2015 and then it was extended to standard browsing as an opt-in feature in 2018.\n\n==Diversity and stability==\nMotivation for the device fingerprint concept stems from the [[forensic science|forensic]] value of [[fingerprint|human fingerprints]]. \n\nIn order to uniquely distinguish over time some devices through their fingerprints, the fingerprints must be both sufficiently diverse and sufficiently stable. In practice neither diversity nor stability is fully attainable, and improving one has a tendency to adversely impact the other. For example, the assimilation of an additional browser setting into the browser fingerprint would usually increase diversity, but it would also reduce stability, because if a user changes that setting, then the browser fingerprint would change as well.{{r|Eckersley2010|p=11}}\n\n[[Entropy (information theory)|Entropy]] is one of several ways to measure diversity.\n\n==Sources of identifying information==\nApplications that are locally installed on a device are allowed to gather a great amount of information about the software and the hardware of the device, often including unique identifiers such as the [[MAC address]] and [[serial number]]s assigned to the machine hardware. Indeed, programs that employ [[digital rights management]] use this information for the very purpose of uniquely identify the device.\n\nEven if they aren\u2019t designed to gather and share identifying information, local applications might unwillingly expose identifying information to the remote parties with which they interact. The most prominent example is that of web browsers, which have been proved to expose diverse and stable information in such an amount to allow remote identification, see {{Section link||Browser fingerprint}}.\n\nDiverse and stable information can also be gathered below the application layer, by leveraging the protocols that are used to transmit data. Sorted by [[OSI model]] layer, some examples of such protocols are:\n\n* OSI Layer 7: [[Server Message Block|SMB]], [[FTP]], [[HTTP]], [[Telnet]], [[Transport layer security|TLS/SSL]], [[DHCP]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chatteronthewire.org/download/chatter-dhcp.pdf |title=Chatter on the Wire: A look at DHCP traffic |accessdate=2010-01-28 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811092914/http://chatteronthewire.org/download/chatter-dhcp.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-11 }}</ref>\n* OSI Layer 5: [[Simple Network Management Protocol|SNMP]], [[NetBIOS]]\n* OSI Layer 4: [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] (see [[TCP/IP stack fingerprinting]])\n* OSI Layer 3: [[IPv4]], [[IPv6]], [[Internet Control Message Protocol|ICMP]], [[IEEE 802.11]]{{r|sandia2006}}\n* OSI Layer 2: [[Cisco Discovery Protocol|CDP]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chatteronthewire.org/download/OS%20FingerPrint.pdf |title=Chatter on the Wire: A look at excessive network traffic and what it can mean to network security. |accessdate=2010-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140828085807/http://chatteronthewire.org/download/OS%20Fingerprint.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-28 }}</ref>\n\nPassive fingerprinting techniques merely require the fingerprinter to observe traffic originated from the target device, while active fingerprinting techniques require the fingerprinter to initiate connections to the target device. Techniques that require to interact with the target device over a connection initiated by the latter are sometimes addressed as semi-passive.{{r|Kohno}}\n\n== Browser fingerprint ==\nThe collection of large amount of diverse and stable information from web browsers is possible thanks for most part to [[client-side scripting]] languages, which have been introduced in the late '90s.\n\n=== Browser version ===\n{{Main|Browser sniffing}}\nBrowsers provide their name and version, together with some compatibility information, in the User-Agent request header.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent|title=User-Agent}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://webaim.org/blog/user-agent-string-history/|title= History of the browser user-agent string|author=Aaron Andersen}}</ref> Being a statement freely given by the client, it shouldn't be trusted when assessing its identity. Instead, the type and version of the browser can be inferred from the observation of quirks in its behavior: for example, the order and number of [[List of HTTP header fields|HTTP header fields]] is unique to each browser family{{r|1=Unger2013|p1=257|2=Fiore2014|p2=357}} and, most importantly, each browser family and version differs in its implementation of [[HTML5]],{{r|1=Abgrall2012|p1=1|2=Unger2013|p2=257}} [[CSS]]{{r|1=Takei2015|p1=58|2=Unger2013|p2=256}} and [[JavaScript]].{{r|1=Nikiforakis2013|p1=547,549-50|2=Mulazzani2013|p2=2|3=Mowery2011|4=Upathilake2015}} Such differences can be remotely tested by using JavaScript. A [[Hamming distance]] comparison of parser behaviors has been shown to effectively fingerprint and differentiate a majority of browser versions.{{r|Abgrall2012|p=6}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ JavaScript object manipulation is specific to each browser family\n|-\n!

Canvas-based techniques may also be used to identify installed [[Computer font|font]]s.{{r|Al-Fannah2017|p=110}} Furthermore, if the user does not have a GPU, [[CPU]] information can be provided to the fingerprinter instead.\n\nA canvas fingerprinting script first draws text of specified font, size, and background color. The image of the text as rendered by the user's browser is then recovered by the ToDataURL Canvas API method. The hashed text-encoded data becomes the user's fingerprint.{{r|1=Acar2014|2=Mowery2012|p2=2-3,6}} Canvas fingerprinting methods have been shown to produce 5.7 bits of entropy. Because the technique obtains information about the user's GPU, the information entropy gained is \"orthogonal\" to the entropy of previous browser fingerprint techniques such as screen resolution and JavaScript capabilities.{{r|Mowery2012}}\n\n=== Hardware benchmarking ===\n[[Benchmark (computing)|Benchmark tests]] can be used to determine whether a user's CPU utilizes [[AES instruction set|AES-NI]] or [[Intel Turbo Boost]] by comparing the [[CPU time]] used to execute various simple or [[encryption|cryptographic algorithms]].{{r|Saito2016|p=588}}\n\nSpecialized [[Application programming interface|APIs]] can also be used, such as the Battery API, which constructs a short-term fingerprint based on the actual battery state of the device,{{r|Olejnik2016|p=256}} or OscillatorNode, which can be invoked to produce a waveform based on user entropy.{{r|Englehardt2016|p=1399}}\n\nA device's hardware ID, which is a [[cryptographic hash function]] specified by the device's [[vendor]], can also be queried to construct a fingerprint.{{r|Al-Fannah2017|p=109,114}}\n\n==Mitigation methods for browser fingerprinting==\n===Offering a simplified fingerprint===\n{{Update|section|date=March 2020}}\nUsers may attempt to reduce their [[wikt:en:fingerprintability|fingerprintability]] by selecting a [[web browser]] which minimizes availability of identifying information such as browser fonts, device ID, [[canvas element]] rendering, [[WebGL]] information, and [[local IP address]].{{r|Al-Fannah2017|p=117}} \n\nAs of 2017 [[Microsoft Edge]] is considered to be the most fingerprintable browser, followed by [[Firefox]] and [[Google Chrome]], [[Internet Explorer]], and [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]].{{r|Al-Fannah2017|p=114}} Among [[mobile browser]]s, Google Chrome and [[Opera Mini]] are most fingerprintable, followed by [[Firefox#Firefox for mobile|mobile Firefox]], mobile Edge, and mobile Safari.{{r|Al-Fannah2017|p=115}} \n\n[[Tor (anonymity network)#Tor Browser|Tor Browser]] disables fingerprintable features such as the canvas and WebGL API and notify users of fingerprint attempts.{{r|Acar2014}}\n\n===Offering a spoofed fingerprint===\n[[wikt:spoof#Verb|Spoofing]] some of the information exposed to the fingerprinter (e.g. the [[user agent]]) may allow to reduce diversity.{{r|Yen2012|p=13}} The contrary could be achieved if the mismatch between the spoofed information and the real browser information differentiates the user from all the others who do not use such strategy.{{r|Nikiforakis2013|p=552}}\n\nSpoofing the information differently at each site visit allow to reduce stability.{{r|Nikiforakis2015|p=820,823}}\n\nDifferent browsers on the same machine would usually have different fingerprints, but if both browsers aren't protected against fingerprinting, then the two fingerprints could be identified as originating from the same machine.{{r|yao2017|Newman}}\n\n===Blocking scripts===\nBlindly blocking client-side scripts served from third-party domains, and possibly also first-party domains (e.g. by disabling JavaScript or using [[NoScript]]) would usually render websites unusable. The preferred approach is to block only third-party domains that seem to track people, either because they're found on a blacklist of tracking domains (the approach followed by most [[ad blocker]]s) or because the intention of tracking is inferred by past observations (the approach followed by [[Privacy Badger]]).{{r|Merzdovnik2017|Davis|Kirk2|Adblock}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Anonymous web

hardware of a remote computing device for the purpose of identification. The information is usually assimilated into a brief identifier using a [[fingerprinting algorithm]]. A '''browser fingerprint''' is information collected specifically by interaction with the [[web browser]] of the device.{{r|1=Laperdrix2016|p1=878|2=Eckersley2010|p2=1}}\n\nDevice fingerprints can be used to fully or partially identify individual devices even when [[persistent cookie]]s (and also [[zombie cookie]]s) can't be read or stored in the browser, the client [[IP address]] is hidden, and even if one switches to another browser on the same device.{{r|yao2017}} \nThis may allow a service provider to detect and prevent [[identity theft]] and [[credit card fraud]],{{r|Alaca2016|p=299|Steinberg2014|infoworld|simility}} but also to compile long-term records of individuals' browsing histories (and deliver [[targeted advertising]]{{r|1=Nikiforakis2015|p1=821|2=Acar2013|p2=9}} or targeted [[exploit (computer security)|exploit]]s{{r|1=Abgrall2012|p1=8|2=Nikiforakis2013|p2=547}}) even when they're attempting to [[Anonymous web browsing|avoid tracking]], raising a major concern for [[internet privacy]] advocates.{{r|eff12ways}}\nSome [[computer security]] experts consider the ease of bulk parameter extraction offered by web browsers to be a [[security hole]].{{r|email}}\n\n==History==\n{{Update|section|date=March 2020}}\nBasic [[web browser]] configuration information has long been collected by [[web analytics]] services in an effort to measure real human [[web traffic]] and discount various forms of [[click fraud]]. And since its introduction in the late 1990s, [[JavaScript|client-side scripting]] has gradually enabled the collection an increasing amount of diverse information.\n\nIn 2005, researchers at [[University of California, San Diego]] showed how [[Transmission Control Protocol| TCP]] timestamps could be used to estimate the [[clock skew]] of a device, and consequently to remotely obtain an hardware fingerprint of the device.{{r|Kohno}}\n\nIn 2010, [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] launched a website where visitors can test their browser fingerprint.{{r|aboutPanop}} After collecting a sample of 470161 fingerprints, they measured at least 18.1 bits of [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] possible from browser fingerprinting,{{r|uniquePanop}} but that was before the advancements of [[canvas fingerprinting]], which claims to add another 5.7 bits.\n\nIn 2012, Keaton Mowery and Hovav Shacham, researchers at [[University of California, San Diego]], showed how the [[HTML5]] [[canvas element]] could be used to create digital fingerprints of web browsers.{{r|Angwin|Mowery2012}}\n\nIn 2013, at least 0.4% of Alexa top 10,000 sites were found to use fingerprinting scripts provided by a few known third parties.{{r|Nikiforakis2013|p=546}}\n\nIn 2014, 5.5% of Alexa top 10,000 sites were found to use canvas fingerprinting scripts served by a total of 20 domains. The overwhelming majority (95%) of the scripts were served by [[AddThis]], which started using canvas fingerprinting in January that year, without the knowledge of some of its clients.{{r|1=Acar2014|p1=678|2=Davis|3=Angwin|4=Knibbs|5=Steinberg2014}}\n\nIn 2015, a feature to protect against browser fingerprinting was introduced in [[Firefox]] version 41,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://github.com/ghacksuserjs/ghacks-user.js/issues/7 |title=meta: tor uplift: privacy.resistFingerprinting  |accessdate=2018-07-06}}</ref> but it has been since left in an experimental stage, not initiated by default.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-protection-against-fingerprinting |title=Firefox's protection against fingerprinting |accessdate=2018-07-06}}</ref><br>\nThe same year a feature named ''Enhanced Tracking Protection'' was introduced in Firefox version 42 to protect against tracking during private browsing<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/42.0/releasenotes/|title=Firefox 42.0 release notes}}</ref> by blocking scripts from third party domains found in the lists published by the company Disconnect.\n\nAt [[WWDC 2018]] [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] announced that [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] on [[macOS Mojave]] \"presents simplified system information when users browse the web, preventing them from being tracked based on their system configuration.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/06/apple-introduces-macos-mojave/ |title=Apple introduces macOS Mojave |accessdate=2018-07-06}}</ref><br>\nA 2018 study revealed that only one-third of browser fingerprints in a French database were unique, indicating that browser fingerprinting may become less effective as the number of users increases and web technologies convergently evolve to implement fewer distinguishing features.{{r|G\u00f3mez-Boix2018}}\n\nIn 2019, starting from Firefox version 69, ''Enhanced Tracking Protection'' has been turned always on by default for all users.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/69.0/releasenotes/|title=Firefox 69.0 release notes}}</ref> The feature was first introduced to protect private browsing in 2015 and then it was extended to standard browsing as an opt-in feature in 2018.\n\n==Diversity and stability==\nMotivation for the device fingerprint concept stems from the [[forensic science|forensic]] value of [[fingerprint|human fingerprints]]. \n\nIn order to uniquely distinguish over time some devices through their fingerprints, the fingerprints must be both sufficiently diverse and sufficiently stable. In practice neither diversity nor stability is fully attainable, and improving one has a tendency to adversely impact the other. For example, the assimilation of an additional browser setting into the browser fingerprint would usually increase diversity, but it would also reduce stability, because if a user changes that setting, then the browser fingerprint would change as well.{{r|Eckersley2010|p=11}}\n\n[[Entropy (information theory)|Entropy]] is one of several ways to measure diversity.\n\n==Sources of identifying information==\nApplications that are locally installed on a device are allowed to gather a great amount of information about the software and the hardware of the device, often including unique identifiers such as the [[MAC address]] and [[serial number]]s assigned to the machine hardware. Indeed, programs that employ [[digital rights management]] use this information for the very purpose of uniquely identify the device.\n\nEven if they aren\u2019t designed to gather and share identifying information, local applications might unwillingly expose identifying information to the remote parties with wich they interact. The most prominent example is that of web browsers, which have been proved to expose diverse and stable information in such an amount to allow remote identification, see {{Section link||Browser fingerprint}}.\n\nDiverse and stable information can also be gathered below the application layer, by leveraging the protocols that are used to transmit data. Sorted by [[OSI model]] layer, some examples of such protocols are:\n\n* OSI Layer 7: [[Server Message Block|SMB]], [[FTP]], [[HTTP]], [[Telnet]], [[Transport layer security|TLS/SSL]], [[DHCP]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chatteronthewire.org/download/chatter-dhcp.pdf |title=Chatter on the Wire: A look at DHCP traffic |accessdate=2010-01-28 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811092914/http://chatteronthewire.org/download/chatter-dhcp.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-11 }}</ref>\n* OSI Layer 5: [[Simple Network Management Protocol|SNMP]], [[NetBIOS]]\n* OSI Layer 4: [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] (see [[TCP/IP stack fingerprinting]])\n* OSI Layer 3: [[IPv4]], [[IPv6]], [[Internet Control Message Protocol|ICMP]], [[IEEE 802.11]]{{r|sandia2006}}\n* OSI Layer 2: [[Cisco Discovery Protocol|CDP]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chatteronthewire.org/download/OS%20FingerPrint.pdf |title=Chatter on the Wire: A look at excessive network traffic and what it can mean to network security. |accessdate=2010-01-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140828085807/http://chatteronthewire.org/download/OS%20Fingerprint.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-28 }}</ref>\n\nPassive fingerprinting techniques merely require the fingerprinter to observe traffic originated from the target device, while active fingerprinting techniques require the fingerprinter to initiate connections to the target device. Techniques that require to interact with the target device over a connection initiated by the latter are sometimes addressed as semi-passive.{{r|Kohno}}\n\n== Browser fingerprint ==\nThe collection of large amount of diverse and stable information from web browsers is possible thanks for most part to [[client-side scripting]] languages, which have been introduced in the late '90s.\n\n=== Browser version ===\n{{Main|Browser sniffing}}\nBrowsers provide their name and version, together with some compatibility information, in the User-Agent request header.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent|title=User-Agent}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://webaim.org/blog/user-agent-string-history/|title= History of the browser user-agent string|author=Aaron Andersen}}</ref> Being a statement freely given by the client, it shouldn't be trusted when assessing its identity. Instead, the type and version of the browser can be inferred from the observation of quirks in its behavior: for example, the order and number of [[List of HTTP header fields|HTTP header fields]] is unique to each browser family{{r|1=Unger2013|p1=257|2=Fiore2014|p2=357}} and, most importantly, each browser family and version differs in its implementation of [[HTML5]],{{r|1=Abgrall2012|p1=1|2=Unger2013|p2=257}} [[CSS]]{{r|1=Takei2015|p1=58|2=Unger2013|p2=256}} and [[JavaScript]].{{r|1=Nikiforakis2013|p1=547,549-50|2=Mulazzani2013|p2=2|3=Mowery2011|4=Upathilake2015}} Such differences can be remotely tested by using JavaScript. A [[Hamming distance]] comparison of parser behaviors has been shown to effectively fingerprint and differentiate a majority of browser versions.{{r|Abgrall2012|p=6}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ JavaScript object manipulation is specific to each browser family\n|-\n!

Canvas-based techniques may also be used to identify installed [[Computer font|font]]s.{{r|Al-Fannah2017|p=110}} Furthermore, if the user does not have a GPU, [[CPU]] information can be provided to the fingerprinter instead.\n\nA canvas fingerprinting script first draws text of specified font, size, and background color. The image of the text as rendered by the user's browser is then recovered by the ToDataURL Canvas API method. The hashed text-encoded data becomes the user's fingerprint.{{r|1=Acar2014|2=Mowery2012|p2=2-3,6}} Canvas fingerprinting methods have been shown to produce 5.7 bits of entropy. Because the technique obtains information about the user's GPU, the information entropy gained is \"orthogonal\" to the entropy of previous browser fingerprint techniques such as screen resolution and JavaScript capabilities.{{r|Mowery2012}}\n\n=== Hardware benchmarking ===\n[[Benchmark (computing)|Benchmark tests]] can be used to determine whether a user's CPU utilizes [[AES instruction set|AES-NI]] or [[Intel Turbo Boost]] by comparing the [[CPU time]] used to execute various simple or [[encryption|cryptographic algorithms]].{{r|Saito2016|p=588}}\n\nSpecialized [[Application programming interface|APIs]] can also be used, such as the Battery API, which constructs a short-term fingerprint based on the actual battery state of the device,{{r|Olejnik2016|p=256}} or OscillatorNode, which can be invoked to produce a waveform based on user entropy.{{r|Englehardt2016|p=1399}}\n\nA device's hardware ID, which is a [[cryptographic hash function]] specified by the device's [[vendor]], can also be queried to construct a fingerprint.{{r|Al-Fannah2017|p=109,114}}\n\n==Mitigation methods for browser fingerprinting==\n===Offering a simplified fingerprint===\n{{Update|section|date=March 2020}}\nUsers may attempt to reduce their [[wikt:en:fingerprintability|fingerprintability]] by selecting a [[web browser]] which minimizes availability of identifying information such as browser fonts, device ID, [[canvas element]] rendering, [[WebGL]] information, and [[local IP address]].{{r|Al-Fannah2017|p=117}} \n\nAs of 2017 [[Microsoft Edge]] is considered to be the most fingerprintable browser, followed by [[Firefox]] and [[Google Chrome]], [[Internet Explorer]], and [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]].{{r|Al-Fannah2017|p=114}} Among [[mobile browser]]s, Google Chrome and [[Opera Mini]] are most fingerprintable, followed by [[Firefox#Firefox for mobile|mobile Firefox]], mobile Edge, and mobile Safari.{{r|Al-Fannah2017|p=115}} \n\n[[Tor (anonymity network)#Tor Browser|Tor Browser]] disables fingerprintable features such as the canvas and WebGL API and notify users of fingerprint attempts.{{r|Acar2014}}\n\n===Offering a spoofed fingerprint===\n[[wikt:spoof#Verb|Spoofing]] some of the information exposed to the fingerprinter (e.g. the [[user agent]]) may allow to reduce diversity.{{r|Yen2012|p=13}} The contrary could be achieved if the mismatch between the spoofed information and the real browser information differentiates the user from all the others who do not use such strategy.{{r|Nikiforakis2013|p=552}}\n\nSpoofing the information differently at each site visit allow to reduce stability.{{r|Nikiforakis2015|p=820,823}}\n\nDifferent browsers on the same machine would usually have different fingerprints, but if both browsers aren't protected against fingerprinting, then the two fingerprints could be identified as originating from the same machine.{{r|yao2017|Newman}}\n\n===Blocking scripts===\nBlindly blocking client-side scripts served from third-party domains, and possibly also first-party domains (e.g. by disabling JavaScript or using [[NoScript]]) would usually render websites unusable. The preferred approach is to block only third-party domains that seem to track people, either because they're found on a blacklist of tracking domains (the approach followed by most [[ad blocker]]s) or because the intention of tracking is inferred by past observations (the approach followed by [[Privacy Badger]]).{{r|Merzdovnik2017|Davis|Kirk2|Adblock}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Anonymous web
