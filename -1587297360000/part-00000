{"title_page": "List of Legend of the Galactic Heroes characters", "text_new": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Legend of the Galactic Heroes'' characters}}\n{{Refimprove|date=September 2011}}\nThis is a '''list of characters''' and their voice actors from '''''[[Legend of the Galactic Heroes]]'''''.\n\n==Main characters==\n\n===Reinhard von Lohengramm===\n'''Reinhard von Lohengramm''', voiced by [[Ry\u014d Horikawa]] <small>(OVA series)</small>, is one of the protagonists in the series along with [[List of Legend of the Galactic Heroes characters#Yang Wen-li|Yang Wen-li]].\nNicknamed ''The Golden Brat'' by his foes and ''The Golden Lion'' by his supporters, he was born into a noble but poor family as ''Reinhard von M\u00fcsel''. As a child, he lived with his father and his older sister, Annerose. (He encountered his mother's death when he was still very young and thus his memories of her were very faint.)\n\nIt is in a middle-class neighborhood, into which Reinhard's family moves, that Reinhard meets Siegfried Kircheis, with whom he develops an intimate friendship. When his father was compelled to sell Annerose for money as a concubine of Emperor Friedrich IV, young Reinhard swears to put an end to the Goldenbaum Dynasty. His determination to avenge the corrupted society thereupon kindles.\n\nHe decides to leave home to join the Cadet School, and persuades Kircheis to come with him. At the age of 15, Reinhard and Kircheis enter their first active service in the army; their rapid promotion in rank follows, owing it to their outstanding contributions to the country. With brilliancy in military strategy especially at a macro-level, and giftedness in civil affairs and in identifying ones with talent, Reinhard succeeds in attracting a great number of able officers, gaining as well the admiration of the public. In solidifying his grounds by gathering advocates, Reinhard does not miss an opportunity to take advantage of his handsomeness and other charming qualities. After being admitted to admiralty at the age of 21, Friedrich IV confers Reinhard the name of ''Lohengramm'', a name of high noble rank which had been defunct until the occasion.\n\nAs his next step, he quickly extends his influence over state matters, and shortly after the decease of the Emperor, eventually overthrows the pre-existing dynasty and marks the beginning of the Lohengramm Dynasty. Reinhard's coronation does not precede his own death by much. Believing that the Universe should be reigned over by the most powerful and capable person, Reinhard leaves a will to his Empress consort [[List of Legend of the Galactic Heroes characters#Hildegard von Mariendorf|Hildegard]], in which he states that if their son (Alexander Siegfried) fails to prove promising as his successor, there should be no reason for the Lohengramm Dynasty to continue. He dies of an unprecedented congenital disease for which no cure seems to have existed at the time. The disease is posthumously named ''The Emperor's Sickness'' by the confused physicians.\n\nThough a matchless genius by all account, Reinhard's main flaw lies in the restriction of his emotions, as he opens his heart to two people only: his beloved sister Annerose and his closest friend and loyal companion Kircheis. Not even his wife Hildegard is allowed within. Annerose describes him as a star that shines brightly until it completely burns itself out; that the day Reinhard slows down his pace would be the dawn of his end.\n\nThe flagship of Reinhard is called ''Br\u00fcnhild''. As it is exclusively painted in white, the flagship is easily distinguishable. Built with the latest technology of the time, the battleship earns a sobriquet \u2018The Unsinkable Ship', for surviving all of her battles without a single damage in spite of its constant acting as a spearhead of the fleet. The only damage Br\u00fcnhild ever receives is caused by an infiltration from which a direct engagement of battle ensues with a boarding party of 730 combatants led by [[List of Legend of the Galactic Heroes characters#Julian Mintz|Julian Mintz]] towards the end of the series. The ship is decommissioned after Reinhard's death and thereafter remains in Dock 01 of the Galactic Empire Odin as a memento. The name Lohengramm is also a reference to [[Lohengrin]], a character from German Arthurian literature.\n\nIn the 2018 series, he is voiced by [[Mamoru Miyano]] in Japanese and by [[Bryce Papenbrook]] in English.\n\n===Yang Wen-li===\n'''Yang Wen-li''', voiced by [[Kei Tomiyama]] <small>(OVA series)</small>, later by [[Hozumi G\u014dda]] <small>(''Gaiden'' series)</small>, is one of two protagonists within the series. Like Reinhard, both of them share similar roles within their respective nations as famous national heroes renowned for their military skill. Compared to Reinhard, Yang is much more humble and dislikes his popularity as being a burden. Yang originally wanted to become a historian and only attended the Free Planets Defense Force Command Academy so he can get free education, while Reinhard relishes his fame and was ambitious to overthrow the empire. At the start of the series, Yang has gained some fame as the \"Hero of El Facil\" for his exploits in the evacuation of the planet before Imperial occupation, and gains much more fame to become a national hero by the end of the first season. During the second season, he generally takes a lesser role compared to Reinhard, but returns in full force in Season 3 before he is assassinated by members of the Terraist Church. Yang was a mild-tempered person who lives on red tea, a genius tactician and strategist that rivals Reinhard. Yang's weakness lies in his unwillingness to risk democracy by assuming more direct powers and responsibilities. Not willing to take on a bigger role or responsibility, he and Reinhard's battle were never in equal footing and at same time handcuffing him from doing things that could change the scale of the power balance. He also openly respects Reinhard and considers him to be a true genius as Reinhard's ability does not seem to confine in just military affairs and is able to act on what his mind tells him while Yang might be reluctant to do so if given same situation. He also agrees that benevolent autocracy is better and more efficient than corrupted democracy if social change is needed, and noted that if he was born in the empire, he would actually volunteer to serve under Reinhard despite his dislike of military. On the other hand, he was glad to be born in the Free Planets Alliance as it gives him freedom, and believes that while democracy is less efficient and can be slowed dramatically with corruption it nevertheless is better because it is less likely to be corrupted completely and no one has absolute power, because after all, a good and wise Emperor such as Reinhard doesn't come along often.\n\nThe ''Hyperion'' is the flagship of Yang Wen-li. It is retrofitted from a frontier security squadron flagship. It is lightly armed, possessing only 32 forward cannons which comprise its main armament. It possesses a large and spread out multi-level [[Bridge (ship)|bridge]] with a large conference table commonly used for meetings by Admiral Yang and his staff, as well as a large tactical viewscreen used during battle to display fleet movements.\n\nIn the 2018 series, he is voiced by [[Kenichi Suzumura]] in Japanese and by [[David Vincent (actor)|David Vincent]] in English.\n\n===Hildegard von Mariendorf===\n'''Hildegard von Mariendorf''', voiced by [[Masako Katsuki]], is one of the principal characters in the series. She served as the New Galactic Fleet's Chief Advisor, and later reigned with Reinhard von Lohengramm when she became his wife and Empress in 801 UC.\n\nHildegard, usually referred to by the nickname Hilda, was born in 777 UC into a distinguished noble family of the Goldenbaum Dynasty, the sole daughter of the benevolent and just Count Franz von Mariendorf. From an early age, she was distinguished from the other girls of the aristocrat society by her independent ideas. Completely unconcerned, Hilda pursued her own interests in reading, politics and history. Her mother having died when Hilda was young, her open-minded father respected Hilda's unique ideas and choices in life.\n\nIn 797 UC, the old Galactic Empire split into civil war, where the old nobility stood against the new emerging camp of military elites led by Reinhard von Lohengramm. Hilda convinced her father to plea allegiance to the latter, whereupon she met Reinhard for the first time and impressed him with the clarity of her insight. When the Lohengramm camp emerged victorious from the civil war, Reinhard gained complete political and military power in the empire, and Hilda became Reinhard's chief secretary and assisted him in the progressive reforms that swept across the empire.\n\nFrom 798 UC to 800 UC, Hilda played an active role on the galactic stage, advising Reinhard wisely on imperial policies and tactics, and became one of his most valued and trusted staff. During Operation Ragnar\u00f6k, where the empire battled the Alliance, Hilda served as a staff officer on board the flagship ''Br\u00fcnhild''. During the critical Battle of Vermilion, she perceived that the situation was in Reinhard's disfavour, and persuaded Admirals Mittermeyer and Reuenthal to mobilize forces against the Alliance capital, turning the war to Reinhard's tactical victory and saving his life. Admiral Mittermeyer later praised Hilda that \"her intelligence is worth more than a fleet.\"  Her role gradually became more public after Reinhard's coronation as the first Emperor of the new Lohengramm Dynasty. In the year UC 800, in the Ninth Battle of Iserlohn, Hilda succeeded Admiral Steinmetz to become the Fleet's Chief Advisor, formally capable of representing the Emperor and command on his behalf on the battlefield. Conscious of her military position, Hilda withheld her political role and refused to advise Reinhard on political matters, despite his repeated requests for her counsel.\n\nIn August 800 UC, Reinhard was attacked by an assassin who sought vengeance for Reinhard's inaction in the Westerland tragedy. Overcame with regret and emotional agony, Reinhard withdrew into his own quarters and Hilda entered to console him. Subconsciously realizing that his reliance on her has deepened past their professional relationship, he asked her to stay, and she agreed, determined to help him to the best of her abilities. The morning after, Reinhard came to Hilda's home and proposed marriage, and Hilda did not immediately reply for the uncertainty whether she can truly give him happiness. She also did not reveal her pregnancy to him until after the Urvashi affair and Reuenthal's subsequent rebellion, which deepened the insight of both Hilda and Reinhard toward their own feelings. When peace was restored, Hilda accepted Reinhard's second proposal, and they were married on January 19, 801 UC. The officials of the empire greeted their new Empress with enthusiasm and joy. On May 14, while Reinhard was away at war, Hilda give birth to a son, whom Reinhard named Alexander Siegfried von Lohengramm. Reinhard's illness seriously exacerbated a mere sixteen days later and was diagnosed with a rare form mutative connective tissue disease, with no known cure. Despite the illness, Reinhard decided to return to the imperial capital for the sake of the people awaiting him there. On July 18, Reinhard and Hilda were re-united. On July 26, the dying Reinhard said his final words to Hilda: \"My Empress, you shall rule the universe more wisely than I. If you think setting up a constitution is the better way then so be it. The universe would be fine as long as the strongest and wisest among all the living governs it. If Alexander Seigfried lacks that ability, there is no need for Lohengramm dynasty to continue. Do everything as you wish; that is my greatest wish...\" He died at the age of twenty-five, with their son succeeding him and Hilda ruling as the Empress dowager.\n\nIn the 2019 film trilogy, she is voiced by [[Kana Hanazawa]] in Japanese and by [[Erika Harlacher]] in English.\n\n===Siegfried Kircheis===\n'''Siegfried Kircheis''', voiced by Masashi Hironaka, flagships Barbarossa. And is usually seen together with Reinhard. Even though Kircheis died very early in the series while protecting Reinhard, he serves as an important role in the series. Reinhard refer him by his last name Kircheis despite their close relationship because Reinhard thought the name Siegfried is too common and boring, while his sister Annerose refer him as Sieg. Kircheis is one of the two most important people in Reinhard's life. Not only does he offer his advice to Reinhard, but he is someone that helps him stay on the right path. Reinhard has always said that Kircheis is someone that can see someone virtuous even in a sewer, and has always had positive thinking no matter what the situation. Kircheis dislikes bloodshed, instead he would rather enemies surrender peacefully and will not pursue a retreating enemy for a kill. He is like Reinhard's shadow even though he is just as talented and intelligent, but Sieg is very satisfied and does not care for power or position, instead he would rather stay by Reinhard's side and protect him. 10 years before the start of the series, Kircheis made a promised Annerose to protect Reinhard and has faithfully kept it ever since. It is hinted that Kircheis is in love with Annerose and that the feeling was mutual, despite neither ever expressing it to each other (at least not shown in any media version). Throughout the series many character have expressed their feelings on how Reinhard might act differently had Kircheis stayed alive. Which often leads to fans believing that if Kircheis hadn't died so early he may have helped Reinhard become even more powerful and lessen his workload which may have prevented Reinhard's death and may even have ended the war more quickly.\n\nAs a military commander, Kircheis was given the highest praise by Yang, stating that Kircheis has no opening for him to take advantage of nor able to allowing him to retreat successfully. Yang also commented after the prisoner exchange that he is more fond of Kircheis (despite it being a quick meeting) than any of politicians in his own country. For the short time he was active in the novel, he was referred to as Reinhard's \"Undefeatable Admiral\" or as the \"Red-hair Brat\" by the high nobles. Kircheis earned the respect of all of Reinhard's other admirals and effectively secured his place as the \"Number 2\" man in Lord Reinhard's ranks. Kind and handsome, he is described to have \"flame-like\" red hair. Kircheis and Lord Reinhard were inseparable as both friends and war comrades. During the first season, Lady Annerose told Kircheis that should Lord Reinhard one day stop listening to him, then he will walk down the path of self-destruction. His flagship Barbarossa was originally going to be a Brunhild class ship like Reinhard's but Kircheis decided that Brunhild should be in a class by its own and declined it in the novel. The ship's body is painted in red in reference to his \"flame-like\" hair. It is also the only ship in series that was never damaged, and according to the databooks, it was decommissioned after Kircheis's death and awarded the spot of Dock 02, docked right next to Brunhild as memento. Despite various posthumous titles given to him by Reinhard, on his tombstone there was only an engraving of his name and phrase \"My friend\". \n\nIn the 2018 anime series, he is voiced by [[Y\u016bichir\u014d Umehara]] in Japanese and by [[Xander Mobus]] in English.\n\n===Julian Mintz===\n'''Julian Mintz''', voiced by [[Nozomu Sasaki]] is the adopted teenage son of Yang Wen-li. Julian's role as Yang Wen-li's assistant starts as a minor character in the beginning of the series, usually seen as taking care of his messy and haphazard adopted guardian, but as the story progresses he becomes more central to the story of the Free Planets Alliance's struggle. Yang Wen-li regularly expressed a desire that Julian would not become a soldier, rather advocating that Julian take a civilian role, perhaps in government, but eventually consents to Julian's entry into the armed forces. After a successful mission to Earth to uncover and eventually (with the inadvertent assistance of the Imperial troops) destroy the headquarters of the notorious Terraist Church, he rises in stature before finally rising after the events of the third series to the reluctant military leader of the Iserlohn Republic Government, at age 18. An astute military commander not unlike his guardian, Julian succeeded into entering negotiations with Kaiser Reinhard after the Battle of Shiva where he negotiated for the autonomy of the planet Heinessen and its surrounding starzone in exchange for control of Iserlohn Fortress. \n\nIn the 2018 series he is voiced by [[Y\u016bki Kaji]] in Japanese and by Zach Aguilar in English.\n\n==Supporting characters==\n\n===Oskar von Reuenthal===\n'''Oskar von Reuenthal''', voiced by [[Norio Wakamoto]], flagship Tristan, is someone with vast intelligence and talent. Nicked name \"Bewitching Eyes\" for his [[heterochromia iridum|complete heterochromia]]. He swore his loyalty to Reinhard when he asked Reinhard to save Mittermeyer from the Goldenbaum Dynasty. Even though he is loyal, he sometimes has thoughts about attaining even more power for himself, which led to his downfall. He has no problems finding women, but he despises the idea of settling down and having children because his mother attempted to kill him when he was an infant due to his heterochromatic eyes. In the end his pride compelled him to rebel after being framed for an assassination attempt against Reinhard and died of wounds taken during a battle against Mittermeyer, but in his heart he was still supportive and loyal to him. Reuenthal left the son that he had with Elfriede von Kohlrausch, to Mittermeyer. \n\nIn the 2018 anime, he is voiced by [[Yuichi Nakamura (voice actor)|Y\u016bichi Nakamura]] in Japanese and by [[Benjamin Diskin|Ben Diskin]] in English.\n\n===Wolfgang Mittermeyer===\n'''Wolfgang Mittermeyer''', voiced by [[Katsuji Mori]], flagship Beowulf, is best friends with Reuenthal and both were together referred to as the \"Twin Pillars of the Empire\", after the death of Kircheis. Mittermeyer served with Reunthal as Reinhard's Fleet Admirals in the new dynasty. Mittermeyer is highly disciplined and moral, finding himself often siding with Reunthal against Oberstein, but also just as often keeping Reunthal's musings in check. At the same time Mittermeyer is extremely loyal to his leader and friend Kaiser Reinhard, choosing to personally confront Reunthal in battle to avoid harbouring any ill will towards the Kaiser should Reunthal have been killed.\nHis attacks were often seen as swift as a gale of wind, earning him the nickname \"The Gale Wolf\". Mittermeyer is also married to Evangeline, whom he met when young and still loves very much. They had tried to have children for many years without success, and later adopted Reuenthal's son as his own, his wife naming the child Felix. \n\nIn the 2018 anime, he is voiced by [[Daisuke Ono]] in Japanese and by [[Ray Chase (voice actor)|Ray Chase]] in English.\n\n===Paul von Oberstein===\n'''Paul von Oberstein''', voiced by [[Kaneto Shiozawa]], first served as Reinhard's advisor and later as Minister of Military Affairs. He has two cybernetic eyes as well as a cold and emotionless personality which makes most people dislike him. He is a strategic genius but is weak wherever human emotions are involved. He is, however, one of Reinhard von Lohengramm's most efficient subordinates, and extremely concerned about the well-being of the new dynasty.\nHe dies during a terrorist attack conducted by the Terraist Church. It is not clear whether he died as a decoy for Reinhard or if it was simply a miscalculation on his plan. He has a dog, for whom he cares deeply. \n\nIn the 2018 anime, Paul is voiced by [[Junichi Suwabe]] in Japanese and by [[Keith Silverstein]] in English.\n\n===Fritz Josef Bittenfeld===\n'''Fritz Josef Bittenfeld''', voiced by [[Keiichi Noda]], flagship K\u00f6nigs Tiger (King Tiger), is the commander of the Schwarz Lanzenreiter (Black Lancers), who are experts in hunter-killer tactics. Bittenfeld was in Reinhard's fleet when Reinhard was just a vice admiral. Bittenfeld is known as a 'wild boar' because of his aggressiveness and temper, and often has problems with Paul von Oberstein because of that. \n\nIn the 2018 anime, he is voiced by [[Tetsu Inada]] in Japanese and by [[Grant George]] in English.\n\n===Ulrich Kesler===\n'''Ulrich Kesler''', voiced by [[Sh\u016bichi Ikeda]], usually does administrative police work and helps Reinhard investigate. He is a righteous individual and very reliable. Reinhard first heard of Kesler from police records where Kesler defended a woman who was supposed to be tortured to death for stepping on a painting of the Kaiser. Kesler was usually sent to serve in rural areas or in similar unpopular assignments as indirect punishment for his integrity under the corrupt old rule. During the 6th Iserlohn battle, Reinhard told Kesler when he gained more power he would give Kesler a position in Odin that is suited for his abilities.\nAfter Reinhard's coronation he is assigned as the leader of the military police. While preventing an assassination attempt against Kaiserine Hildegard and Crown Princess Annerose by the Terraist cult, he meets Marika von Freuerbach, a servant, whom he marries two years later. He is also promoted to Fleet Admiral after Reinhard's death.\n\n===Neidhardt M\u00fcller===\n'''Neidhardt M\u00fcller''', voiced by [[Y\u016b Mizushima]], flagship L\u00fcbeck, is known as the \"Iron Shield\" in honor of successfully defending Reinhard in the Battle of Vermillion to the point of changing his command to five different ships after the destruction of the previous ones, including his own flagship. M\u00fcller was awarded the new class battleship Percivale in recognition of his service. He is the youngest of all Reinhard's admirals.\n\n===Adalbert von Fahrenheit===\n'''Adalbert von Fahrenheit''', voiced by [[Sh\u014d Hayami]], flagship Ahsgrimm, is known for his strong offensive tactics. Fahrenheit opposed Reinhard during the Lippschadt war, but surrendered and was given amnesty after the war ended. Highly valued for his capabilities, Fahrenheit was restored to active duty as one of Reinhard's admirals.  He is later killed in battle at the Isherlohn Corridor. \n\nIn the 2018 anime he's voiced by Ryota Takeuchi in Japanese and by [[Matthew Mercer|Matt Mercer]] in English.\n\n===Ernst von Eisenach===\n'''Ernst von Eisenach''', voiced by [[Masane Tsukayama]], known as the Silent Admiral.  He is not really mute and is known for surprising all the admirals once by uttering merely \"Checkmate\" after a strategic meeting. He usually uses hand signs in lieu of verbal commands to direct his fleet in battle. His most significant maneuver came in the Battle of Shiva, where he nearly wiped out the entirety of the Iserlohn Fleet along with Fritz Josef Bittenfeld. In that maneuver, his fleet caused significant damage to the Flagship Hyperion, killing High Admiral Merkatz.\n\n==Groups==\n\n===Reich / Galactic Empire===\n\n====Lohengramm faction====\n* [[Reinhard von Lohengramm]] (von M\u00fcsel) -

As a child, he lived with his father and his older sister, Annerose. (He encountered his mother's death when he was still very young and thus his memories of her were very faint.)\n\nIt is in a middle-class neighborhood, into which Reinhard's family moves, that Reinhard meets Siegfried Kircheis, with whom he develops an intimate friendship. When his father was compelled to sell Annerose for money as a concubine of Emperor Friedrich IV, young Reinhard swears to put an end to the Goldenbaum Dynasty. His determination to avenge the corrupted society thereupon kindles.\n\nHe decides to leave home to join the Cadet School, and persuades Kircheis to come with him. At the age of 15, Reinhard and Kircheis enter their first active service in the army; their rapid promotion in rank follows, owing it to their outstanding contributions to the country. With brilliancy in military strategy especially at a macro-level, and giftedness in civil affairs and in identifying ones with talent, Reinhard succeeds in attracting a great number of able officers, gaining as well the admiration of the public. In solidifying his grounds by gathering advocates, Reinhard does not miss an opportunity to take advantage of his handsomeness and other charming qualities. After being admitted to admiralty at the age of 21, Friedrich IV confers Reinhard the name of ''Lohengramm'', a name of high noble rank which had been defunct until the occasion.\n\nAs his next step, he quickly extends his influence over state matters, and shortly after the decease of the Emperor, eventually overthrows the pre-existing dynasty and marks the beginning of the Lohengramm Dynasty. Reinhard's coronation does not precede his own death by much. Believing that the Universe should be reigned over by the most powerful and capable person, Reinhard leaves a will to his Empress consort [[List of Legend of the Galactic Heroes characters#Hildegard von Mariendorf|Hildegard]], in which he states that if their son (Alexander Siegfried) fails to prove promising as his successor, there should be no reason for the Lohengramm Dynasty to continue. He dies of an unprecedented congenital disease for which no cure seems to have existed at the time. The disease is posthumously named ''The Emperor's Sickness'' by the confused physicians.\n\nThough a matchless genius by all account, Reinhard's main flaw lies in the restriction of his emotions, as he opens his heart to two people only: his beloved sister Annerose and his closest friend and loyal companion Kircheis. Not even his wife Hildegard is allowed within. Annerose describes him as a star that shines brightly until it completely burns itself out; that the day Reinhard slows down his pace would be the dawn of his end.\n\nThe flagship of Reinhard is called ''Br\u00fcnhild''. As it is exclusively painted in white, the flagship is easily distinguishable. Built with the latest technology of the time, the battleship earns a sobriquet \u2018The Unsinkable Ship', for surviving all of her battles without a single damage in spite of its constant acting as a spearhead of the fleet. The only damage Br\u00fcnhild ever receives is caused by an infiltration from which a direct engagement of battle ensues with a boarding party of 730 combatants led by [[List of Legend of the Galactic Heroes characters#Julian Mintz|Julian Mintz]] towards the end of the series. The ship is decommissioned after Reinhard's death and thereafter remains in Dock 01 of the Galactic Empire Odin as a memento. The name Lohengramm is also a reference to [[Lohengrin]], a character from German Arthurian literature.\n\nIn the 2018 series, he is voiced by [[Mamoru Miyano]] in Japanese and by [[Aaron Dismuke]] in English.\n\n===Yang Wen-li===\n'''Yang Wen-li''', voiced by [[Kei Tomiyama]] <small>(OVA series)</small>, later by [[Hozumi G\u014dda]] <small>(''Gaiden'' series)</small>, is one of two protagonists within the series. Like Reinhard, both of them share similar roles within their respective nations as famous national heroes renowned for their military skill. Compared to Reinhard, Yang is much more humble and dislikes his popularity as being a burden. Yang originally wanted to become a historian and only attended the Free Planets Defense Force Command Academy so he can get free education, while Reinhard relishes his fame and was ambitious to overthrow the empire. At the start of the series, Yang has gained some fame as the \"Hero of El Facil\" for his exploits in the evacuation of the planet before Imperial occupation, and gains much more fame to become a national hero by the end of the first season. During the second season, he generally takes a lesser role compared to Reinhard, but returns in full force in Season 3 before he is assassinated by members of the Terraist Church. Yang was a mild-tempered person who lives on red tea, a genius tactician and strategist that rivals Reinhard. Yang's weakness lies in his unwillingness to risk democracy by assuming more direct powers and responsibilities. Not willing to take on a bigger role or responsibility, he and Reinhard's battle were never in equal footing and at same time handcuffing him from doing things that could change the scale of the power balance. He also openly respects Reinhard and considers him to be a true genius as Reinhard's ability does not seem to confine in just military affairs and is able to act on what his mind tells him while Yang might be reluctant to do so if given same situation. He also agrees that benevolent autocracy is better and more efficient than corrupted democracy if social change is needed, and noted that if he was born in the empire, he would actually volunteer to serve under Reinhard despite his dislike of military. On the other hand, he was glad to be born in the Free Planets Alliance as it gives him freedom, and believes that while democracy is less efficient and can be slowed dramatically with corruption it nevertheless is better because it is less likely to be corrupted completely and no one has absolute power, because after all, a good and wise Emperor such as Reinhard doesn't come along often.\n\nThe ''Hyperion'' is the flagship of Yang Wen-li. It is retrofitted from a frontier security squadron flagship. It is lightly armed, possessing only 32 forward cannons which comprise its main armament. It possesses a large and spread out multi-level [[Bridge (ship)|bridge]] with a large conference table commonly used for meetings by Admiral Yang and his staff, as well as a large tactical viewscreen used during battle to display fleet movements.\n\nIn the 2018 series, he is voiced by [[Kenichi Suzumura]] in Japanese and by [[Ian Sinclair (voice actor)|Ian Sinclair]] in English.\n\n===Hildegard von Mariendorf===\n'''Hildegard von Mariendorf''', voiced by [[Masako Katsuki]], is one of the principal characters in the series. She served as the New Galactic Fleet's Chief Advisor, and later reigned with Reinhard von Lohengramm when she became his wife and Empress in 801 UC.\n\nHildegard, usually referred to by the nickname Hilda, was born in 777 UC into a distinguished noble family of the Goldenbaum Dynasty, the sole daughter of the benevolent and just Count Franz von Mariendorf. From an early age, she was distinguished from the other girls of the aristocrat society by her independent ideas. Completely unconcerned, Hilda pursued her own interests in reading, politics and history. Her mother having died when Hilda was young, her open-minded father respected Hilda's unique ideas and choices in life.\n\nIn 797 UC, the old Galactic Empire split into civil war, where the old nobility stood against the new emerging camp of military elites led by Reinhard von Lohengramm. Hilda convinced her father to plea allegiance to the latter, whereupon she met Reinhard for the first time and impressed him with the clarity of her insight. When the Lohengramm camp emerged victorious from the civil war, Reinhard gained complete political and military power in the empire, and Hilda became Reinhard's chief secretary and assisted him in the progressive reforms that swept across the empire.\n\nFrom 798 UC to 800 UC, Hilda played an active role on the galactic stage, advising Reinhard wisely on imperial policies and tactics, and became one of his most valued and trusted staff. During Operation Ragnar\u00f6k, where the empire battled the Alliance, Hilda served as a staff officer on board the flagship ''Br\u00fcnhild''. During the critical Battle of Vermilion, she perceived that the situation was in Reinhard's disfavour, and persuaded Admirals Mittermeyer and Reuenthal to mobilize forces against the Alliance capital, turning the war to Reinhard's tactical victory and saving his life. Admiral Mittermeyer later praised Hilda that \"her intelligence is worth more than a fleet.\"  Her role gradually became more public after Reinhard's coronation as the first Emperor of the new Lohengramm Dynasty. In the year UC 800, in the Ninth Battle of Iserlohn, Hilda succeeded Admiral Steinmetz to become the Fleet's Chief Advisor, formally capable of representing the Emperor and command on his behalf on the battlefield. Conscious of her military position, Hilda withheld her political role and refused to advise Reinhard on political matters, despite his repeated requests for her counsel.\n\nIn August 800 UC, Reinhard was attacked by an assassin who sought vengeance for Reinhard's inaction in the Westerland tragedy. Overcame with regret and emotional agony, Reinhard withdrew into his own quarters and Hilda entered to console him. Subconsciously realizing that his reliance on her has deepened past their professional relationship, he asked her to stay, and she agreed, determined to help him to the best of her abilities. The morning after, Reinhard came to Hilda's home and proposed marriage, and Hilda did not immediately reply for the uncertainty whether she can truly give him happiness. She also did not reveal her pregnancy to him until after the Urvashi affair and Reuenthal's subsequent rebellion, which deepened the insight of both Hilda and Reinhard toward their own feelings. When peace was restored, Hilda accepted Reinhard's second proposal, and they were married on January 19, 801 UC. The officials of the empire greeted their new Empress with enthusiasm and joy. On May 14, while Reinhard was away at war, Hilda give birth to a son, whom Reinhard named Alexander Siegfried von Lohengramm. Reinhard's illness seriously exacerbated a mere sixteen days later and was diagnosed with a rare form mutative connective tissue disease, with no known cure. Despite the illness, Reinhard decided to return to the imperial capital for the sake of the people awaiting him there. On July 18, Reinhard and Hilda were re-united. On July 26, the dying Reinhard said his final words to Hilda: \"My Empress, you shall rule the universe more wisely than I. If you think setting up a constitution is the better way then so be it. The universe would be fine as long as the strongest and wisest among all the living governs it. If Alexander Seigfried lacks that ability, there is no need for Lohengramm dynasty to continue. Do everything as you wish; that is my greatest wish...\" He died at the age of twenty-five, with their son succeeding him and Hilda ruling as the Empress dowager.\n\nIn the 2019 film trilogy, she is voiced by [[Kana Hanazawa]] in Japanese and by [[Brittany Lauda]] in English.\n\n===Siegfried Kircheis===\n'''Siegfried Kircheis''', voiced by Masashi Hironaka, flagships Barbarossa. And is usually seen together with Reinhard. Even though Kircheis died very early in the series while protecting Reinhard, he serves as an important role in the series. Reinhard refer him by his last name Kircheis despite their close relationship because Reinhard thought the name Siegfried is too common and boring, while his sister Annerose refer him as Sieg. Kircheis is one of the two most important people in Reinhard's life. Not only does he offer his advice to Reinhard, but he is someone that helps him stay on the right path. Reinhard has always said that Kircheis is someone that can see someone virtuous even in a sewer, and has always had positive thinking no matter what the situation. Kircheis dislikes bloodshed, instead he would rather enemies surrender peacefully and will not pursue a retreating enemy for a kill. He is like Reinhard's shadow even though he is just as talented and intelligent, but Sieg is very satisfied and does not care for power or position, instead he would rather stay by Reinhard's side and protect him. 10 years before the start of the series, Kircheis made a promised Annerose to protect Reinhard and has faithfully kept it ever since. It is hinted that Kircheis is in love with Annerose and that the feeling was mutual, despite neither ever expressing it to each other (at least not shown in any media version). Throughout the series many character have expressed their feelings on how Reinhard might act differently had Kircheis stayed alive. Which often leads to fans believing that if Kircheis hadn't died so early he may have helped Reinhard become even more powerful and lessen his workload which may have prevented Reinhard's death and may even have ended the war more quickly.\n\nAs a military commander, Kircheis was given the highest praise by Yang, stating that Kircheis has no opening for him to take advantage of nor able to allowing him to retreat successfully. Yang also commented after the prisoner exchange that he is more fond of Kircheis (despite it being a quick meeting) than any of politicians in his own country. For the short time he was active in the novel, he was referred to as Reinhard's \"Undefeatable Admiral\" or as the \"Red-hair Brat\" by the high nobles. Kircheis earned the respect of all of Reinhard's other admirals and effectively secured his place as the \"Number 2\" man in Lord Reinhard's ranks. Kind and handsome, he is described to have \"flame-like\" red hair. Kircheis and Lord Reinhard were inseparable as both friends and war comrades. During the first season, Lady Annerose told Kircheis that should Lord Reinhard one day stop listening to him, then he will walk down the path of self-destruction. His flagship Barbarossa was originally going to be a Brunhild class ship like Reinhard's but Kircheis decided that Brunhild should be in a class by its own and declined it in the novel. The ship's body is painted in red in reference to his \"flame-like\" hair. It is also the only ship in series that was never damaged, and according to the databooks, it was decommissioned after Kircheis's death and awarded the spot of Dock 02, docked right next to Brunhild as memento. Despite various posthumous titles given to him by Reinhard, on his tombstone there was only an engraving of his name and phrase \"My friend\". \n\nIn the 2018 anime series, he is voiced by [[Y\u016bichir\u014d Umehara]] in Japanese and by [[Clifford Chapin]] in English.\n\n===Julian Mintz===\n'''Julian Mintz''', voiced by [[Nozomu Sasaki]] is the adopted teenage son of Yang Wen-li. Julian's role as Yang Wen-li's assistant starts as a minor character in the beginning of the series, usually seen as taking care of his messy and haphazard adopted guardian, but as the story progresses he becomes more central to the story of the Free Planets Alliance's struggle. Yang Wen-li regularly expressed a desire that Julian would not become a soldier, rather advocating that Julian take a civilian role, perhaps in government, but eventually consents to Julian's entry into the armed forces. After a successful mission to Earth to uncover and eventually (with the inadvertent assistance of the Imperial troops) destroy the headquarters of the notorious Terraist Church, he rises in stature before finally rising after the events of the third series to the reluctant military leader of the Iserlohn Republic Government, at age 18. An astute military commander not unlike his guardian, Julian succeeded into entering negotiations with Kaiser Reinhard after the Battle of Shiva where he negotiated for the autonomy of the planet Heinessen and its surrounding starzone in exchange for control of Iserlohn Fortress. \n\nIn the 2018 series he is voiced by [[Y\u016bki Kaji]] in Japanese and by [[Matt Shipman]] in English.\n\n==Supporting characters==\n\n===Oskar von Reuenthal===\n'''Oskar von Reuenthal''', voiced by [[Norio Wakamoto]], flagship Tristan, is someone with vast intelligence and talent. Nicked name \"Bewitching Eyes\" for his [[heterochromia iridum|complete heterochromia]]. He swore his loyalty to Reinhard when he asked Reinhard to save Mittermeyer from the Goldenbaum Dynasty. Even though he is loyal, he sometimes has thoughts about attaining even more power for himself, which led to his downfall. He has no problems finding women, but he despises the idea of settling down and having children because his mother attempted to kill him when he was an infant due to his heterochromatic eyes. In the end his pride compelled him to rebel after being framed for an assassination attempt against Reinhard and died of wounds taken during a battle against Mittermeyer, but in his heart he was still supportive and loyal to him. Reuenthal left the son that he had with Elfriede von Kohlrausch, to Mittermeyer. \n\nIn the 2018 anime, he is voiced by [[Yuichi Nakamura (voice actor)|Y\u016bichi Nakamura]] in Japanese and by [[Ricco Fajardo]] in English.\n\n===Wolfgang Mittermeyer===\n'''Wolfgang Mittermeyer''', voiced by [[Katsuji Mori]], flagship Beowulf, is best friends with Reuenthal and both were together referred to as the \"Twin Pillars of the Empire\", after the death of Kircheis. Mittermeyer served with Reunthal as Reinhard's Fleet Admirals in the new dynasty. Mittermeyer is highly disciplined and moral, finding himself often siding with Reunthal against Oberstein, but also just as often keeping Reunthal's musings in check. At the same time Mittermeyer is extremely loyal to his leader and friend Kaiser Reinhard, choosing to personally confront Reunthal in battle to avoid harbouring any ill will towards the Kaiser should Reunthal have been killed.\nHis attacks were often seen as swift as a gale of wind, earning him the nickname \"The Gale Wolf\". Mittermeyer is also married to Evangeline, whom he met when young and still loves very much. They had tried to have children for many years without success, and later adopted Reuenthal's son as his own, his wife naming the child Felix. \n\nIn the 2018 anime, he is voiced by [[Daisuke Ono]] in Japanese and by [[Josh Grelle]] in English.\n\n===Paul von Oberstein===\n'''Paul von Oberstein''', voiced by [[Kaneto Shiozawa]], first served as Reinhard's advisor and later as Minister of Military Affairs. He has two cybernetic eyes as well as a cold and emotionless personality which makes most people dislike him. He is a strategic genius but is weak wherever human emotions are involved. He is, however, one of Reinhard von Lohengramm's most efficient subordinates, and extremely concerned about the well-being of the new dynasty.\nHe dies during a terrorist attack conducted by the Terraist Church. It is not clear whether he died as a decoy for Reinhard or if it was simply a miscalculation on his plan. He has a dog, for whom he cares deeply. \n\nIn the 2018 anime, Paul is voiced by [[Junichi Suwabe]] in Japanese and by [[J. Michael Tatum]] in English.\n\n===Fritz Josef Bittenfeld===\n'''Fritz Josef Bittenfeld''', voiced by [[Keiichi Noda]], flagship K\u00f6nigs Tiger (King Tiger), is the commander of the Schwarz Lanzenreiter (Black Lancers), who are experts in hunter-killer tactics. Bittenfeld was in Reinhard's fleet when Reinhard was just a vice admiral. Bittenfeld is known as a 'wild boar' because of his aggressiveness and temper, and often has problems with Paul von Oberstein because of that. \n\nIn the 2018 anime, he is voiced by [[Tetsu Inada]] in Japanese and by [[Austin Tindle]] in English.\n\n===Ulrich Kesler===\n'''Ulrich Kesler''', voiced by [[Sh\u016bichi Ikeda]], usually does administrative police work and helps Reinhard investigate. He is a righteous individual and very reliable. Reinhard first heard of Kesler from police records where Kesler defended a woman who was supposed to be tortured to death for stepping on a painting of the Kaiser. Kesler was usually sent to serve in rural areas or in similar unpopular assignments as indirect punishment for his integrity under the corrupt old rule. During the 6th Iserlohn battle, Reinhard told Kesler when he gained more power he would give Kesler a position in Odin that is suited for his abilities.\nAfter Reinhard's coronation he is assigned as the leader of the military police. While preventing an assassination attempt against Kaiserine Hildegard and Crown Princess Annerose by the Terraist cult, he meets Marika von Freuerbach, a servant, whom he marries two years later. He is also promoted to Fleet Admiral after Reinhard's death.\n\n===Neidhardt M\u00fcller===\n'''Neidhardt M\u00fcller''', voiced by [[Y\u016b Mizushima]], flagship L\u00fcbeck, is known as the \"Iron Shield\" in honor of successfully defending Reinhard in the Battle of Vermillion to the point of changing his command to five different ships after the destruction of the previous ones, including his own flagship. M\u00fcller was awarded the new class battleship Percivale in recognition of his service. He is the youngest of all Reinhard's admirals.\n\n===Adalbert von Fahrenheit===\n'''Adalbert von Fahrenheit''', voiced by [[Sh\u014d Hayami]], flagship Ahsgrimm, is known for his strong offensive tactics. Fahrenheit opposed Reinhard during the Lippschadt war, but surrendered and was given amnesty after the war ended. Highly valued for his capabilities, Fahrenheit was restored to active duty as one of Reinhard's admirals.  He is later killed in battle at the Isherlohn Corridor. \n\nIn the 2018 anime he's voiced by Ryota Takeuchi in Japanese and by Daman Mills in English.\n\n===Ernst von Eisenach===\n'''Ernst von Eisenach''', voiced by [[Masane Tsukayama]], known as the Silent Admiral.  He is not really mute and is known for surprising all the admirals once by uttering merely \"Checkmate\" after a strategic meeting. He usually uses hand signs in lieu of verbal commands to direct his fleet in battle. His most significant maneuver came in the Battle of Shiva, where he nearly wiped out the entirety of the Iserlohn Fleet along with Fritz Josef Bittenfeld. In that maneuver, his fleet caused significant damage to the Flagship Hyperion, killing High Admiral Merkatz.\n\n==Groups==\n\n===Reich / Galactic Empire===\n\n====Lohengramm faction====\n* Reinhard von Lohengramm (von M\u00fcsel) -

Westview Press.</ref>\n\nThe mechanisms used to produce sound vary from one family of [[cetaceans]] to another. [[Marine mammal]]s, such as whales, [[dolphin]]s, and [[porpoise]]s, are much more dependent on sound for communication and sensation than are land mammals, because other senses are of limited effectiveness in water. [[Visual perception|Sight]] is less effective for marine mammals because of the particulate way in which the ocean scatters [[light]]. [[Olfaction|Smell]] is also limited, as [[molecule]]s diffuse more slowly in water than in air, which makes smelling less effective. However, the [[speed of sound]] is roughly four times greater in water than in the atmosphere at [[sea level]]. As sea mammals are so dependent on hearing to communicate and feed, environmentalists and [[cetology|cetologists]] are concerned that they are being harmed by the increased [[ambient noise]] in the world's oceans caused by [[ship]]s, [[sonar]] and marine seismic surveys.<ref name=\"Melc\u00f3n2012\"/>\n\nThe word \"[[song]]\" is used to describe the pattern of regular and predictable sounds made by some species of whales, notably the [[humpback whale]]. This is included with or in comparison with [[music]], and male humpback whales have been described as \"inveterate [[composers]]\" of songs that are \"'strikingly similar' to human musical traditions\".<ref>Payne Roger, quoted in: Author(s): Susan Milius. \"Music without Borders\", p. 253. Source: ''Science News'', Vol. 157, No. 16, (15 April 2000), pp. 252-254.

Within the larynx, when the [[vocal cords]] are brought close together, the passing air will force them to alternately close and open, separating the continuous airstream into discrete pulses of air that are heard as a vibration.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dosits.org/animals/soundproduction/mammalsproduce/ |date=July 2009 |title=How do marine mammals produce sounds? |accessdate=15 October 2013}}</ref> This vibration is further modified by [[speech organs]] in the [[mouth|oral]] and [[nasal cavity|nasal]] cavities, creating sounds which are used in [[human voice|human speech]].\n\nCetacean sound production differs markedly from this mechanism. The precise mechanism differs in the two major suborders of cetaceans:&nbsp;the&nbsp;''Odontoceti''&nbsp;([[toothed whales]]\u2014including dolphins) and the ''Mysticeti'' ([[baleen whale]]s\u2014including the largest whales, such as the [[blue whale]]).\n\n===Odontocete whales ===\n[[File:Delfinekko.gif|thumb|left|Process in a dolphin echolocation: in green the sounds generated by the dolphin, in red from the fish.]]\n[[Image:Dolphin head.svg|300px|thumb|alt=Outline of what's inside a dolphin head.

Specialized organs in an odontocete produce collections of clicks and buzzes at frequencies from 0.2 to 150&nbsp;kHz to obtain sonic information about its environment. Lower frequencies are used for distance echolocation, due to the fact that shorter wavelengths do not travel as far as longer wavelengths underwater. Higher frequencies are more effective at shorter distances, and can reveal more detailed information about a target. Echoes from clicks convey, not only the distance to the target, but also the size, shape, speed, and vector of its movement. Additionally, echolocation allows the odontocete to easily discern the difference between objects that are different in material composition, even if visually identical, by their different densities. Individuals also appear to be able to isolate their own echoes during pod feeding activity without interference from other pod members' echolocations.<ref name=\"dolphins.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dolphins.org/marineed_acoustics.php|title=Page not found - Dolphin Research Center|author=|date=|website=Dolphin Research Center}}</ref>\n\nWhistles are used for communication, and four- to six-month-old calves develop unique sounds that they use most frequently throughout their lives. Such \"signature whistles\" are distinctive to the individual and may serve as a form of identification among other odontocetes.<ref name=\"dolphins.org\"/> Though a large pod of dolphins will produce a wide range of different noises, very little is known about the meaning of the sound.

Westview Press.</ref>\n\nThe mechanisms used to produce sound vary from one family of [[cetaceans]] to another. [[Marine mammal]]s, such as whales, [[dolphin]]s, and [[porpoise]]s, are much more dependent on sound for communication and sensation than are land mammals, because other senses are of limited effectiveness in water. [[Visual perception|Sight]] is less effective for marine mammals because of the particulate way in which the ocean scatters [[light]]. [[Olfaction|Smell]] is also limited, as [[molecule]]s diffuse more slowly in water than in air, which makes smelling less effective. However, the [[speed of sound]] is roughly four times greater in water than in the atmosphere at [[sea level]]. As sea mammals are so dependent on hearing to communicate and feed, environmentalists and [[cetology|cetologists]] are concerned that they are being harmed by the increased [[ambient noise]] in the world's oceans caused by [[ship]]s, [[sonar]] and marine seismic surveys.<ref name=\"Melc\u00f3n2012\"/>\n\nThe word \"[[song]]\" is used to describe the pattern of regular and predictable sounds made by some species of whales, notably the [[humpback whale]]. This is included with or in comparison with [[music]], and male humpback whales have been described as \"inveterate [[composers]]\" of songs that are \"'strikingly similar' to human musical traditions\".<ref>Payne Roger, quoted in: Author(s): Susan Milius. \"Music without Borders\", p. 253.

This clicking sequences reportedly allow the groups to coordinate foraging activities.<ref>Michel Andre and Cees Kamminga (2000) Rhythmic dimension in the echolocation click trains of sperm whales: a possible function of identification and communication Journal of Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, Vol. 80, pp. 163-169.</ref>\n\n==Production of sound==\n[[Humans]] produce [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] sounds by passing air through the [[larynx]]. Within the larynx, when the [[vocal cords]] are brought close together, the passing air will force them to alternately close and open, separating the continuous airstream into discrete pulses of air that are heard as a vibration.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dosits.org/animals/soundproduction/mammalsproduce/ |date=July 2009 |title=How do marine mammals produce sounds? |accessdate=15 October 2013}}</ref> This vibration is further modified by [[speech organs]] in the [[mouth|oral]] and [[nasal cavity|nasal]] cavities, creating sounds which are used in [[human voice|human speech]].\n\nCetacean sound production differs markedly from this mechanism. The precise mechanism differs in the two major suborders of cetaceans:&nbsp;the&nbsp;''Odontoceti''&nbsp;([[toothed whales]]\u2014including dolphins) and the ''Mysticeti'' ([[baleen whale]]s\u2014including the largest whales, such as the [[blue whale]]).\n\n===Odontocete whales ===\n[[File:Delfinekko.gif|thumb|left|Process in a dolphin echolocation: in green the sounds generated by the dolphin, in red from the fish.]]\n[[Image:Dolphin head.svg|300px|thumb|alt=Outline of what's inside a dolphin head. The skull is to the rear of the head, with the jaw bones extending narrowly forward to the nose. The anterior bursa occupies most of the upper front of the head, ahead of the skull and above the jaw. A network of air passages run from the upper roof of the mouth, past the back of the anterior bursa, to the [[blowhole (anatomy)|blowhole]]. The posterior bursa is a small region behind the air passages, opposite the anterior bursa. Small phonic tips connect the bursa regions to the air passages.|Idealized dolphin head showing the regions involved in sound production. This image was redrawn from Cranford (2000).]]\nOdontocetes produce rapid bursts of high-frequency clicks that are thought to be primarily for [[animal echolocation|echolocation]]. Specialized organs in an odontocete produce collections of clicks and buzzes at frequencies from 0.2 to 150&nbsp;kHz to obtain sonic information about its environment. Lower frequencies are used for distance echolocation, due to the fact that shorter wavelengths do not travel as far as longer wavelengths underwater. Higher frequencies are more effective at shorter distances, and can reveal more detailed information about a target. Echoes from clicks convey, not only the distance to the target, but also the size, shape, speed, and vector of its movement. Additionally, echolocation allows the odontocete to easily discern the difference between objects that are different in material composition, even if visually identical, by their different densities. Individuals also appear to be able to isolate their own echoes during pod feeding activity without interference from other pod members' echolocations.<ref name=\"dolphins.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dolphins.org/marineed_acoustics.php|title=Page not found - Dolphin Research Center|author=|date=|website=Dolphin Research Center}}</ref>\n\nWhistles are used for communication, and four- to six-month-old calves develop unique sounds that they use most frequently throughout their lives. Such \"signature whistles\" are distinctive to the individual and may serve as a form of identification among other odontocetes.<ref name=\"dolphins.org\"/> Though a large pod of dolphins will produce a wide range of different noises, very little is known about the meaning of the sound. Frankel quotes one researcher who says listening to a school of odontocetes is like listening to a group of children at a school playground.<ref name=Frankel>Frankel, Adam S. \"Sound production\", ''Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals'', 1998, pp. 1126\u20131137. {{ISBN|0-12-551340-2}}.</ref>\n\nThe multiple sounds odontocetes make are produced by passing air through a structure in the head called the '''phonic lips'''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Cranford|first=Ted W.|last2=Elsberry|first2=Wesley R.|last3=Bonn|first3=William G.

The base units of the song (sometimes loosely called the \"[[note (music)|notes]]\") are single uninterrupted emissions of sound that last up to a few seconds. These sounds vary in frequency from 20&nbsp;Hz to upward of 24&nbsp;kHz (the typical human range of hearing is 20&nbsp;Hz to 20&nbsp;kHz). The units may be [[frequency modulation|frequency modulated]] (i.e., the pitch of the sound may go up, down, or stay the same during the note) or [[amplitude modulation|amplitude modulated]] (get louder or quieter). However, the adjustment of bandwidth on a spectrogram representation of the song reveals the essentially [[Pulse (signal processing)|pulsed]] nature of the FM sounds.\n\nA collection of four or six units is known as a sub-[[phrase]], lasting perhaps ten seconds (see also [[phrase (music)]]).<ref name=Frankel/> A collection of two sub-phrases is a phrase. A whale will typically repeat the same phrase over and over for two to four minutes. This is known as a theme.

The suggested format was one where after the first round the top six teams would continue while the bottom three teams would have other matches arranged for them.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Management Committee\n| page =8\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LV| issue=86\n| date = 1924-04-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240410.2.136.1\n| accessdate = 2019-09-04}}</ref> However all nine teams remained in the grade until the end of the season. The Mangere United team was a combined team from the Manukau and Mangere clubs. Both clubs retained their own identity in the junior grades.\n\nOn the opening day of the season all four First Grade matches were played on [[Carlaw Park]]. The junior matches on the same day were postponed as the railway workers were on strike and there was no way for the players to reach the outer suburban grounds which were used for matches in these grades.\n\n[[Marist Saints|Marist]] won the first grade championship for the first time in their history after defeating Devonport in the final by 20 points to 17 in front of a club record crowd of 17,000 at [[Carlaw Park]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Marist Win Final Replay/Twenty Points to Seventeen/Devonport Just Beaten\n| page =6\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXI| issue=18826\n| date = 1924-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19240929.2.12.1\n| accessdate = 2019-09-09}}</ref> While City won the Roope Rooster competition for the 4th time.\n\n{{s-start}}\n    {{s-bef|before=[[1923 Auckland Rugby League season|1923]]}}\n    {{s-ttl|title=16th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n    |years=1924}}\n    {{s-aft|after=[[1925 Auckland Rugby League season|1925]]}}\n    {{end}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\n===Lou Brown Transfer Issue===\n[[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], the New Zealand international had played for [[Newton Rangers]] in 1922 and 1923 however at the end of the season he moved to England to play for Wigan. He had been granted a release by Newton and the New Zealand Rugby League. Upon his return he wished to play for the [[City Rovers]] club and he turned out for them despite being told by the [[Auckland Rugby League]] that he was not eligible to play for them. City were adamant that he had been fully released and could play for any team. The New Zealand Rugby League Council supported the decision but Brown played anyway. He was subsequently suspended for 3 matches. City took the extraordinary step of withdrawing its team from the competition and they defaulted their Round 9 match with Mangere United.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Mankukau Change Over, \n| page =8\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LV| issue=165\n| date = 1924-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref> On 18 July Newton held a special board meeting and agreed to grant Brown a transfer and thus the issue was finally settled.\n\n===Manukau Rovers Club Switches to Rugby Union===\nThe entire [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau Rovers]] club switched to rugby union after a dispute with Auckland Rugby League. The issue arose after one of their players (\"King\") was suspended for four playing Saturdays. He had been suspended because he was registered with the Manukau club but \"suddenly joined, or played, for a Mangere team without having been granted a transfer\". An opposing team had protested and King had also moved back to the Manukau team. The Manukau club took exception to the decision and refused to play any of its six teams in the following grades: Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth A, and Sixth B. It then went a step further by switching the rugby union with the Auckland Rugby Union accepting the club.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Manukau Change Over/The Reason Why/Exception Taken to League's Ruling\n| page =5\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LV| issue=162\n| date = 1924-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref> The Secretary of the club, C.

This rule would come into place from Saturday, 23 August onwards.\n\n== First Grade Championship ==\nA record nine teams competed in the First Grade competition in 1924 with the addition of the Mangere and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] senior teams. Mangere had their colours registered as green and black. This team was essentially the Manukau Magpies club of today though they had a patchy existence for their first two decades. It was initially decided that after the first round the bottom three teams would drop out of the competition for the second round. At the end of the first round these teams were Mangere, and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]]. However this was later rescinded and all teams remained in the competition until the end of the season.\n\n=== Final Standings ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=175

The Mangere United team was a combined team from the Manukau and Mangere clubs. Both clubs retained their own identity in the junior grades.\n\nOn the opening day of the season all four First Grade matches were played on [[Carlaw Park]]. The junior matches on the same day were postponed as the railway workers were on strike and there was no way for the players to reach the outer suburban grounds which were used for matches in these grades.\n\n[[Marist Saints|Marist]] won the first grade championship for the first time in their history after defeating Devonport in the final by 20 points to 17 in front of a club record crowd of 17,000 at [[Carlaw Park]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Marist Win Final Replay/Twenty Points to Seventeen/Devonport Just Beaten\n| page =6\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXI| issue=18826\n| date = 1924-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19240929.2.12.1\n| accessdate = 2019-09-09}}</ref> While City won the Roope Rooster competition for the 4th time.\n\n{{s-start}}\n    {{s-bef|before=[[1923 Auckland Rugby League season|1923]]}}\n    {{s-ttl|title=16th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n    |years=1924}}\n    {{s-aft|after=[[1925 Auckland Rugby League season|1925]]}}\n    {{end}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\n===Lou Brown Transfer Issue===\n[[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], the New Zealand international had played for [[Newton Rangers]] in 1922 and 1923 however at the end of the season he moved to England to play for Wigan. He had been granted a release by Newton and the New Zealand Rugby League. Upon his return he wished to play for the [[City Rovers]] club and he turned out for them despite being told by the [[Auckland Rugby League]] that he was not eligible to play for them. City were adamant that he had been fully released and could play for any team. The New Zealand Rugby League Council supported the decision but Brown played anyway. He was subsequently suspended for 3 matches. City took the extraordinary step of withdrawing its team from the competition and they defaulted their Round 9 match with Mangere United.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Mankukau Change Over, \n| page =8\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LV| issue=165\n| date = 1924-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref> On 18 July Newton held a special board meeting and agreed to grant Brown a transfer and thus the issue was finally settled.\n\n===Manukau Rovers Club Switches to Rugby Union===\nThe entire [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau Rovers]] club switched to rugby union after a dispute with Auckland Rugby League. The issue arose after one of their players (\"King\") was suspended for four playing Saturdays. He had been suspended because he was registered with the Manukau club but \"suddenly joined, or played, for a Mangere team without having been granted a transfer\". An opposing team had protested and King had also moved back to the Manukau team. The Manukau club took exception to the decision and refused to play any of its six teams in the following grades: Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth A, and Sixth B. It then went a step further by switching the rugby union with the Auckland Rugby Union accepting the club.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Manukau Change Over/The Reason Why/Exception Taken to League's Ruling\n| page =5\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LV| issue=162\n| date = 1924-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref> The Secretary of the club, C.

This rule would come into place from Saturday, 23 August onwards.\n\n== First Grade Championship ==\nA record nine teams competed in the First Grade competition in 1924 with the addition of the Mangere and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] senior teams. Mangere had their colours registered as green and black. This team was essentially the Manukau Magpies club of today though they had a patchy existence for their first two decades. It was initially decided that after the first round the bottom three teams would drop out of the competition for the second round. At the end of the first round these teams were Mangere, and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]]. However this was later rescinded and all teams remained in the competition until the end of the season.\n\n=== Final Standings ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=175

As a result many players from the struggling [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] team made the trip to [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Win for South Auckland/Auckland Defeated By 21 To 5/Mediocre Representative Team\n| page =4\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXI| issue=18820\n| date = 1924-09-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19240922.2.7.5\n| accessdate = 2019-09-02}}</ref>\n\n===Auckland v Australian Universities===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 4 June\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Auckland\n| score = 15\u20137\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Visiting League Team/Australian Universities/Auckland Wins First Game/Fifteen Points to Seven/Superiority Throughout\n| page =9\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXI| issue=18727\n| date = 1924-06-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19240605.2.124\n| accessdate = 2019-09-05}}</ref>\n| away = Australian Universities\n| try1 = [[George Davidson (athlete)|George Davidson]], [[Ivan Littlewood]] 2\n| con1 = [[Craddock Dufty]], [[Bert Laing]]\n| pen1 = [[Craddock Dufty]]\n| try2 = Barry\n| con2 = Ryan\n| pen2 = Ryan\n| stadium = Carlaw Park 1\n| attendance = 7000\n| referee = Neild\n}}\n\n===Auckland v Australian Universities===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 7 June\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Auckland\n| score = 17\u20132\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Beaten Again/Aussies\u2019 Poor Exhibition/Auckland Too Good/Football in the Mud\n| page =10\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LV| issue=135\n| date = 1924-06-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240609.2.122\n| accessdate = 2019-09-05}}</ref>\n| away = Australian Universities\n| try1 = [[Ben Davidson (rugby league)|Ben Davidson]], McNeil, [[Nelson Bass]]\n| con1 = [[Craddock Dufty]] 3\n| pen1 = [[Craddock Dufty]]\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = Ryan\n| stadium = Carlaw Park 1\n| attendance = 4000\n| referee = A Gallagher\n}}\n\n===Auckland v Australian Universities===\n[[Frank Delgrosso]] had to come on the replace [[George Davidson (athlete)|George Davidson]] after he collided badly with team mate [[Clarrie Polson]] when they were both going after the ball.
