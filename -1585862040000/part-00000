First come the vehicles of the \u015br\u0101vakas, pratyekabuddhas and bodhisattvas. Then come the three vehicles of \"outer\" yoga, and then the three vehicles of \"inner\" yoga. The \"inner yoga\" vehicles are Mah\u0101yoga, Anuyoga and Atiyoga. The Dzogchen teachings are part of Atiyoga.<ref group=web name=\"Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV\" />}} In this text, ''Anuyoga'' is the stage of yogic bliss, while ''Atiyoga'' is the stage of the realization of the \"nature of reality.\"<ref group=web name=\"Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV\" /> According to van Schaik, this fits with the three stages of deity yoga as described in a work attributed to Padmasambhava: development (kye), perfection (dzog) and great perfection (dzogchen).<ref group=web name=\"Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV\" /> ''Atiyoga'' here is not a vehicle, but a stage or aspect of yogic practice.<ref group=web name=\"Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV\" /> In Tibetan sources, until the 10th century ''Atiyoga'' is characterized as a \"mode\" (''tshul'') or a \"view\" (''lta ba''), which is to be applied within deity yoga.<ref group=web name=\"Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV\" />\n\nAccording to van Schaik, the concept of dzogchen, \"great perfection,\" first appeared as the culmination of the meditative practice of [[deity yoga]]{{refn|group=note|The visualization of a deity and recitation of his or her mantra.<ref group=web name=\"Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV\" />}} around the 8th century.<ref group=web name=\"Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV\" /> The term ''dzogchen'' was likely taken from the ''[[Guhyagarbhatantra]]''. This tantra describes, as other tantras, how in the creation stage one generates a visualisation of a deity and its [[mandala]]. This is followed by the completion stage, in which one dissolves the deity and the mandala into oneself, merging oneself with the deity. In the ''Guhyagarbhatantra'' and some other tantras, there follows a stage called ''rdzogs chen'', in which one rests in the natural state of the innately [[Luminous mind|luminous and pure mind]].{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}}\n\nIn the 9th and 10th centuries deity yoga was contextualized in Dzogchen in terms of nonconceptuality, [[Nondualism|nonduality]] and the spontaneous presence of the enlightened state.<ref group=web name=\"Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV\" /> Some Dunhuang texts dated at the 10th century show the first signs of a developing nine vehicles system. Nevertheless, ''Anuyoga'' and ''Atiyoga'' are still regarded then as modes of ''Mah\u0101yoga'' practice.<ref group=web name=\"Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV\" /> Only in the 11th century came ''Atiyoga'' to be treated as a separate vehicle, at least in the newly emerging Nyingma tradition.<ref group=web name=\"Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV\" /> Nevertheless, even in the 13th century (and later) the idea of Atiyoga as a vehicle was controversial in other Buddhist schools.<ref group=web name=\"Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV\" /> Van Schaik quotes Sakya Pandita as writing, in his ''Distinguishing the Three Vows'':\n{{quote|If one understands this tradition properly,<br>Then the view of Atiyoga too<br>Is wisdom and not a vehicle.<ref group=web name=\"Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV\" />}}\n\n====Early Dzogchen \u2013 the Mind series (9th\u201310th century)====\nMost of the early Dzogchen literature, which are claimed to be \"translations\", are original compositions from a much later date than the 8th century.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} According to Germano, the Dzogchen-tradition first appeared in the first half of the 9th century, with a series of short texts attributed to Indian saints.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} They were codified into a canon of eighteen texts which were referred to as \"mind oriented\" (''sems phyogs''), and later became known as \"mind series\" (sems de''). {{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}}\n\nThe mind series reflect the teachings of early Dzogchen, which rejected all forms of practice, and asserted that striving for liberation would simply create more delusion.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}}{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} One has simply to recognize the nature of one's own mind, which is naturally empty (''stong pa''), luminous ('''od gsal ba''), and pure.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} According to Germano, its characteristic language, which is marked by naturalism and negation, is already pronounced in some Indian tantras.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} Nevertheless, these texts are still inextricably bound up with tantric [[Mahayoga]], with its visualisations of deities and mandals, and complex initiations.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}}\n\nDuring the 9th and 10th centuries these texts, which represent the dominant form of the tradition in the 9th and 10th centuries,{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} were gradually transformed into full-fledged tantras, culminating in the [[Kulayar\u0101ja Tantra]] (''kun byed rgyal po'', \"The All-Creating King\"{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}}), in the last half of the 10th or the first half of the 11th century.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} According to Germano, this tantra was historically perhaps the most important and widely quoted of all Dzogchen scriptures.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}}\n\n====Transformation \u2013 the Space and Instruction series (11th\u201314th century)====\nEarly Dzogchen was completely transformed in the 11th century,{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} with the [[History of Tibet#Era of Fragmentation|renaissance of Tibetan culture]] occurring from the late 10th century to the early 12th century,{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}}known as the later dissemination of Buddhism.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} New techniques and doctrines were introduced from India, resulting in new schools of Tibetan Buddhism,{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}}{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} and radical new developments in Dzogchen doctrine and practice, with a growing emphasis on meditative practice.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} The older Bon and Nyingma traditions incorporated these new influences through the process of [[Terma (religion)|Treasure revelation]].{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} Especially the ''[[yogini]]'' tantras were influential, involving horrific imagery and violent rituals, erotic imagery, and sexual and somatic practices.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} These influences are reflected in the rise of [[subtle body]] representations and practices, new pantheons of wrathful and erotic Buddhas, increasingly [[Antinomianism|antinomium]] rhetorics, and a focus on death-motifs.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546-2547}}\n\nThese influences were incorporated in several movements such as the \"Secret Cycle\" (''gsang skor''),{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2547}} \"Ultra Pith\" (''yang tig''),{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2547}} \"Brahmin's tradition\" (''bram ze'i lugs''),{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2547}}{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2547}} the \"Space Class Series,\"{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} and especially the \"Instruction Class series\",{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} which culminated in the \"Seminal Heart\" (''snying thig''), which emerged in the late 11th and early 12th century.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2547}}\n\nThe \"Seminal Heart\" belongs to the \"Instruction series.\"{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2547}} The main texts of the instruction series are the so-called [[seventeen tantras]] and the two \"seminal heart\" collections, namely the ''[[Vima Nyingtik|bi ma snying thig]]'' (''Vima Nyingthig'',{{sfn|Stewart MacKenzie|2014}} \"Seminal Heart of Vimalamitra\") and the ''mkha' 'gro snying thig'' (''Khandro nyingthig'',{{sfn|Stewart MacKenzie|2014}} \"Seminal Heart of the Dakini\").{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} The \"Seminal Heart of Vimalamitra\" is attributed to Vimalamitra, but was largely composed by their discoverers, in the 11th and 12th century.{{sfn|Germano|Gyatso|2001|p=244}} The \"Seminal Heart of the Dakini\" was produced by Tsultrim Dorje (''Tshul khrims rdo rje'')(1291-1315/17).{{sfn|Germano|Gyatso|2001|p=244}}\n\nThe Seminal Heart teachings became the dominant Dzogchen-teachings,{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}} but was also criticized by conservative strands within the Nyingma-school.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}} The most important Nyingma of the 12th century, Nyangrel Nyingma \u00d6zer (''Nyang ral nyi ma 'od zer'', 1136\u20131204{{refn|group=note|In the eleventh and twelfth centuries there were several competing terma traditions surrounding [[Vimalamitra]], [[Songtsen Gampo]], [[Vairotsana]] and

He systematized the Seminal Heart teachings{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}} and other collections of texts that were circulating at the time in Tibet,{{sfn|Irons|2008|p=169}} in the [[Seven Treasuries]] (''mdzod bdun''), the \"Trilogy of Natural Freedom\" (''rang grol skor gsum''), and the [[Trilogy of Natural Ease]] (''ngal gso skor gsum'').{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}}{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}} Longchenpa refined the terminology and interpretations, and integrated the Seminal Heart teachings with broader Mahayana literature.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}}\n\nMalcolm Smith notes that Longchenpa's ''Tshig don mdzod,'' the [[Seven Treasuries|\"Treasury of Subjects,\"]]<ref group=web name=\"MS\">[http://www.atikosha.org/2012/09/a-preliminary-note-on-vimalamitras.html Malcolm Smith, ''A Preliminary Note on Vimalamitra's Aural Lineage '']</ref> was preceded by several other texts by other authors dealing with the same topics.<ref group=web name=\"MS\"/> Smith mentions the 12th century text \"The Eleven Subjects of The Great Perfection\"{{refn|group=note|''rdzogs pa chen po tshig don bcu gcig pa bzhugs so''}} by Nyi 'bum.

The Madhyamika philosophy obtained a central position in the [[Nyingma]], [[Kagyu]], [[Sakya]] and [[Gelugpa]] schools. The [[Jonang|Jonang school]], which until recently was thought to be extinct, developed a different interpretation of [[Two truths doctrine|ultimate truth]].\nDzogchen texts use unique terminology to describe the Dzogchen view. Some of these terms deal with the different elements and features of the mind. The generic term for consciousness is ''shes pa'', and includes the six sense consciousnesses. Different forms of shes pa include ''ye shes'' ([[J\u00f1\u0101na]], 'pristine consciousness') and ''shes rab'' ([[Praj\u00f1\u0101 (Buddhism)|praj\u00f1\u0101]], wisdom).<ref>Smith, Malcom; BUDDHAHOOD IN THIS LIFE, The Great Commentary by Vimalamitra, pg 12.</ref> According to [[Sam van Schaik]], two significant terms used in Dzogchen literature is the Ground (''gzhi'') and Gnosis (''rig pa''), which represent the \"ontological and gnoseological aspects of the nirvanic state\" respectively.<ref>Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, p. 52.</ref> Dzogchen literature also describes nirvana as the \"expanse\" (''klong'' or ''dbyings'') or the \"true expanse\" (''chos dbyings'', Sanskrit: [[Dharmadhatu]]). The term [[Dharmakaya]] is also often associated with these terms in Dzogchen,<ref>Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 52.</ref> as explained by [[Tulku Urgyen]]:\n<blockquote>Dharmakaya is like space. You cannot say there is any limit to space in any direction. No matter how far you go, you never reach a point where space stops and that is the end of space. Space is infinite in all directions; so is dharmakaya. Dharmakaya is all-pervasive and totally infinite, beyond any confines or limitations. This is so for the dharmakaya of all buddhas. There is no individual dharmakaya for each buddha, as there is no individual space for each country.<ref>Erik Pema Kunsang; Wellsprings of the Great Perfection The Lives and Insights of the Early Masters, p. 3</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Malcolm Smith, the Dzogchen view is also based on the Indian Buddhist [[Buddha-nature]] doctrine of the [[Tath\u0101gatagarbha s\u016btras]].<ref>Smith, Malcom; BUDDHAHOOD IN THIS LIFE, The Great Commentary by Vimalamitra, pg 15.</ref> According to the 14th Dalai Lama the Ground is the Buddha-nature, the nature of mind which is emptiness.<ref> The (14th) Dalai Lama (2000), ''Dzogchen: Heart Essence of the Great Perfection'', p.109</ref> According to Rinpoche Thrangu, [[Rangjung Dorje]] (1284\u20131339), the third Karmapa Lama (head of the Karma Kagyu) and Nyingma lineage holder, also stated that the Ground is Buddha-nature.{{refn|group=note|Rangjung Dorje also influenced [[Dolpopa]].

The knowledge that ensues from recognizing this mirror-like clarity (which cannot be found by searching nor identified){{sfn|Third Dzogchen Rinpoche|2008|p=152}} is called [[rigpa]].{{sfn|Namdak|2006|p=97}}\n\nAccording to [[Alexander Berzin (scholar)|Alexander Berzin]], there are three aspects of rigpa:<ref group=web name=\"Berzin-Major Facets\" />\n# The essential nature of rigpa: primal purity (ka-dag). Rigpa is primordially without stains, both being self-void (''rang-stong'') and other-void (''gzhan-stong'');\n# The influencing nature of rigpa: the manner in which rigpa influences others. Rigpa is responsiveness (''thugs-rje'', compassion). It responds effortlessly and spontaneously to others with compassion;\n# The functional nature of rigpa: rigpa effortlessly and spontaneously establishes \"appearances\" (''lhun-grub'').\n\nAs Berzin notes, all of the good qualities (''yon-tan'') of a Buddha are already \"are innate (''lhan-skyes'') to rigpa, which means that they arise simultaneously with each moment of rigpa, and primordial (''gnyugs-ma''), in the sense of having no beginning.<ref group=web name=\"Berzin-Major Facets\" />\n\nSam van Schaik translates rigpa as \"[[gnosis]]\" which he glosses as \"a form of awareness aligned to the nirvanic state\".<ref>Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 54.</ref> He notes that other definitions of rigpa include \"free from elaborations\" (''srpos bral''), \"non conceptual\" (''rtog med'') and \"transcendent of the intellect\" (''blo 'das''). It is also often paired with emptiness, as in the contraction ''rig stong'' (gnosis-emptiness).<ref>Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 54.</ref>\n\nJohn W. Pettit notes that ''rigpa'' is seen as beyond affirmation and negation, acceptance and rejection, and therefore it is known as \"natural\" (''ma bcos pa'') and \"effortless\" (''rtsol med'') once recognized.<ref>Pettit, John W; Mipham's Beacon of Certainty: Illuminating the View of Dzogchen, 1999, page 78</ref> Because of this, Dzogchen is also known as the pinnacle and final destination of all paths.\n\n===Ma Rigpa===\n''Ma Rigpa'' ([[Avidy\u0101 (Buddhism)|avidy\u0101]]) is the opposite of rigpa or knowledge. ''Ma rigpa'' is ignorance or unawareness, the failure to recognize the nature of the basis. An important theme in Dzogchen texts is explaining how ignorance arises from the basis or [[Dharmata]], which is associated with ''ye shes'' or 'pristine consciousness'.<ref>Smith, Malcom; BUDDHAHOOD IN THIS LIFE, The Great Commentary by Vimalamitra, pg 14.</ref> Automatically arising unawareness (''lhan-skyes ma-rigpa'') exists because the basis is seen having a natural cognitive potentiality and luminosity (''gdangs''), which is the ground for [[samsara]] and [[nirvana]]. When consciousness fails to recognize that all phenomena arise as the creativity (''rtsal'') of the nature of mind and misses its own luminescence or does not \"recognize its own face\", sentient beings arise instead of Buddhas. As explained by [[Tulku Urgyen]]:\n\n<blockquote>In the case of an ignorant sentient being the mind is called empty cognizance suffused with ignorance (marigpa). The mind of all the Buddhas is called empty cognizance suffused with awareness (rigpa).<ref>Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche; Repeating the Words of the Buddha, page 44</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to [[Vimalamitra]]'s ''Illuminating Lamp'', delusion arises because sentient beings \"lapse towards external mentally apprehended objects\". This external grasping is then said to produce sentient beings out of [[dependent origination]].<ref>Smith, Malcom; BUDDHAHOOD IN THIS LIFE, The Great Commentary by Vimalamitra, pg 20.</ref> This dualistic conceptualizing process which leads to samsara is termed [[Manas-vijnana|manas]] as well as \"awareness moving away from the ground\".<ref>Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 56.</ref>\n\n===Immanence and Distinction===\n[[File:Dzong.jpg|thumb|The [[Garuda]] is used as a symbol of primordial nature, which is already completely perfect, since this mythological animal is said to be born fully grown.<ref>Sogyal Rinpoche, The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying, page 109.</ref>]]\nAccording to Sam van Schaik, there is a certain tension in Dzogchen thought (as in other forms of Buddhism) between the idea that [[samsara]] and [[nirvana]] are immanent within each other and yet are still different. In texts such as the [[Longchen Nyingtig]] for example, the basis and rigpa are presented as being \"intrinsically innate to the individual mind\".<ref>Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 54.</ref> The ''Great Perfection Tantra of the Expanse of Samantabhadra\u2019s Wisdom'' states:\n\n<blockquote>If you think that he who is called \u201cthe heart essence of all buddhas, the Primordial Lord, the noble Victorious One, Samantabhadra\u201d is contained in a mindstream separate from the ocean-like realm of sentient beings, then this is a nihilistic view in which samsara and nirvana remain unconnected.<ref>Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 55.</ref></blockquote>\n\nLikewise, [[Longchenpa]] (12th century), writes in his ''Illuminating Sunlight'':\n\n<blockquote>Every type of experiential content belonging to samsara and nirvana has, as its very basis, a natural state that is a spontaneously present buddha\u2014a dimension of purity and perfection, that is perfect by nature. This natural state is not created by a profound buddha nor by a clever sentient being. Independent of causality, causes did not produce it and conditions can not make it perish. This state is one of self-existing wakefulness, defying all that words can describe, in a way that also transcends the reach of the intellect and thoughts. It is within the nonarising vastness of such a basic natural state that all phenomena belonging to samsara and nirvana are, essentially and without any exception, a state of buddha\u2014purity and perfection.<ref>Erik Pema Kunsang; Wellsprings of the Great Perfection The Lives and Insights of the Early Masters, page 1</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis lack of difference between these two states, their [[non-dual]] (''advaya'') nature, corresponds with the idea that change from one to another doesn't happen due to an ordinary process of causation but is an instantaneous and perfect 'self-recognition' (''rang ngo sprod'') of what is already innately (''lhan-skyes'') there.<ref>Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 56.</ref> According to John W. Pettit, this idea has its roots in Indian texts such as [[Nagarjuna]]'s [[Mulamadhyamakakarika]], which states that samsara and nirvana are not separate and that there is no difference between the \"doer\", the \"going\" and the \"going to\" (i.e. the ground, path and fruit).<ref>Pettit, John W.; Mipham's Beacon of Certainty: Illuminating the View of Dzogchen, 1999, page 78</ref>\n\nIn spite of this emphasis on immanence, Dzogchen texts do indicate a subtle difference between terms associated with delusion (''kun gzhi'' or ''alaya'', ''sems'' or mind) and terms associated with full enlightenment (''dharmakaya'' and ''rigpa'').<ref>Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 57.</ref> The Alaya and [[\u0100layavij\u00f1\u0101na]] are associated with karmic imprints (''vasana'') of the mind and with mental afflictions (''klesa''). The \"alaya for habits\" is the basis (''gzhi'') along with ignorance (''marigpa'') which includes all sorts of obscuring habits and grasping tendencies.<ref group=web name=\"Berzin-Major Facets\" />\n\nThese terms stem from Indian [[Yogacara]] texts, such as the [[Ratnagotravibh\u0101ga]].<ref>Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 59.</ref>\n\n===Harmonisation with Madhyamaka===\nKoppl notes that although later Nyingma authors such as [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Mipham]] attempted to harmonize the view of Dzogchen with [[Madhyamaka]], the earlier Nyingma author [[Rongzom Chokyi Zangpo]] did not.{{sfn|Koppl|2008}}{{refn|group=quote|Heidi Koppl: \"Unlike Mipham, Rongzom did not attempt to harmonize the view of Mantra or Dzogchen with Madhyamaka.\"{{sfn|Koppl|2008}}}} Rongzom held that the views of sutra such as Madhyamaka were inferior to that of tantra.{{sfn|Koppl|2008|p=ch4}}{{refn|group=quote|Heidi Koppl: \"By now we have seen that Rongzom regards the views of the Sutrayana as inferior to those of Mantra, and he underscores his commitment to the purity of all phenomena by criticizing the Madhyamaka objectification of the authentic relative truth.\"{{sfn|Koppl|2008}}}} In contrast, the 14th Dalai Lama, in his book Dzogchen, <ref>the Dalai Lama, Dzogchen p. 158 (Snow Lion 2004)</ref> concludes that Madhyamaka and Dzogchen come down to the same point. The view of reality obtained through Madhyamaka philosophy and the Dzogchen view of Rigpa can be regarded as identical. With regard to the practice in these traditions, however, at the initial stages there do seem certain differences in practice and emphasis.\n\n==Teachings and practice==\nDzogchen is a secret teaching emphasizing the rigpa view. It is a secret from those who are incapable of receiving it. The student can properly receive it with direct in-person realization under a guru's instruction. It is accessible to all; however, it is generally considered an advanced practice because safety from generating an incorrect view necessitates preliminary practices with a teacher's empowerment. {{sfn|Ingram|1993|}}\n\nDzogchen teachings emphasize naturalness, spontaneity and simplicity.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2545}} Although Dzogchen is portrayed as being distinct from tantra, it has incorporated many concepts and practices from tantric Buddhism.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2545}} It embraces a widely varied array of traditions, that range from a systematic rejection of all tantric practices, to a full incorporation of tantric practices.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2545}}\n\n===Three principles===\nThe [[Vima Nyingtik|\"Seminal Heart of Vimalamitra\"]] epitomized the Dzogchen teaching in three principles, known as the Three Statements of Garab Dorje (Tsik Sum N\u00e9 Dek).

This fixation inhibits the arising of extraneous thoughts [...] however, the second exercise in the same category involves the sounding of the syllable PHAT! which instantly shatters one's thoughts and attachments.

But one doesn't keep hold of this knife either; one lets the knife go, so there is a gap. When you cut through again and again in this way, the string of thought falls to pieces.

If one observes the mind and searches for where a thought (''rnam-rtog'') arises, where it remains, and where it goes, no matter how much one researches and investigates this, one will find nothing. It is this very \"unfindability\" (''mi rnyed'') of the arising, the abiding, and the passing away of thoughts which is the greatest of all finds. Thoughts do not arise from anywhere (''byung sa med''), they do not remain anywhere (''gnas sa med''), and they do not go anywhere ('''gro sa med''). They do not arise from within the body, nor do they arise from outside the body. They are truly without any root or source (''ghzi med rsta bral''). Like the clouds in the sky, they arise only to dissolve again. Thoughts arise out of the state of emptiness and return again into this state of emptiness, which represents pure potentiality. We only have to observe our mind to discover this for ourselves.

It was a very beautiful night. The dark blue sky was clear and the stars shone brilliantly. The sound of their solitude was heightened by the distant barking of a dog from the monastery below. Patrul Rinpoche was lying stretched out on the ground, doing a special Dzogchen practice. He called Nyoshul Lungtok over to him, saying: \"Did you say you do not know the essence of Mind?\" Nyoshul Lungtok guessed from his tone that this was a special moment and nodded expectantly.<br>\"There's nothing to it really,\" Patrul Rinpoche said casually, and added, \"My son, come and lie down over here: be like your old father.\" Nyoshul Lungtok stretched out by his side.

First come the vehicles of the \u015br\u0101vakas, pratyekabuddhas and bodhisattvas. Then come the three vehicles of \"outer\" yoga, and then the three vehicles of \"inner\" yoga. The \"inner yoga\" vehicles are Mah\u0101yoga, Anuyoga and Atiyoga. The Dzogchen teachings are part of Atiyoga.<ref group=web name=\"Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV\" />}} In this text, ''Anuyoga'' is the stage of yogic bliss, while ''Atiyoga'' is the stage of the realization of the \"nature of reality.\"<ref group=web name=\"Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV\" /> According to van Schaik, this fits with the three stages of deity yoga as described in a work attributed to Padmasambhava: development (kye), perfection (dzog) and great perfection (dzogchen).<ref group=web name=\"Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV\" /> ''Atiyoga'' here is not a vehicle, but a stage or aspect of yogic practice.<ref group=web name=\"Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV\" /> In Tibetan sources, until the 10th century ''Atiyoga'' is characterized as a \"mode\" (''tshul'') or a \"view\" (''lta ba''), which is to be applied within deity yoga.<ref group=web name=\"Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV\" />\n\nAccording to van Schaik, the concept of dzogchen, \"great perfection,\" first appeared as the culmination of the meditative practice of [[deity yoga]]{{refn|group=note|The visualization of a deity and recitation of his or her mantra.<ref group=web name=\"Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV\" />}} around the 8th century.<ref group=web name=\"Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV\" /> The term ''dzogchen'' was likely taken from the ''[[Guhyagarbhatantra]]''. This tantra describes, as other tantras, how in the creation stage one generates a visualisation of a deity and its [[mandala]]. This is followed by the completion stage, in which one dissolves the deity and the mandala into oneself, merging oneself with the deity. In the ''Guhyagarbhatantra'' and some other tantras, there follows a stage called ''rdzogs chen'', in which one rests in the natural state of the innately [[Luminous mind|luminous and pure mind]].{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}}\n\nIn the 9th and 10th centuries deity yoga was contextualized in Dzogchen in terms of nonconceptuality, [[Nondualism|nonduality]] and the spontaneous presence of the enlightened state.<ref group=web name=\"Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV\" /> Some Dunhuang texts dated at the 10th century show the first signs of a developing nine vehicles system. Nevertheless, ''Anuyoga'' and ''Atiyoga'' are still regarded then as modes of ''Mah\u0101yoga'' practice.<ref group=web name=\"Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV\" /> Only in the 11th century came ''Atiyoga'' to be treated as a separate vehicle, at least in the newly emerging Nyingma tradition.<ref group=web name=\"Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV\" /> Nevertheless, even in the 13th century (and later) the idea of Atiyoga as a vehicle was controversial in other Buddhist schools.<ref group=web name=\"Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV\" /> Van Schaik quotes Sakya Pandita as writing, in his ''Distinguishing the Three Vows'':\n{{quote|If one understands this tradition properly,<br>Then the view of Atiyoga too<br>Is wisdom and not a vehicle.<ref group=web name=\"Schaik_Early Dzogchen IV\" />}}\n\n====Early Dzogchen \u2013 the Mind series (9th\u201310th century)====\nMost of the early Dzogchen literature, which are claimed to be \"translations\", are original compositions from a much later date than the 8th century.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} According to Germano, the Dzogchen-tradition first appeared in the first half of the 9th century, with a series of short texts attributed to Indian saints.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} They were codified into a canon of eighteen texts which were referred to as \"mind oriented\" (''sems phyogs''), and later became known as \"mind series\" (sems de''). {{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}}\n\nThe mind series reflect the teachings of early Dzogchen, which rejected all forms of practice, and asserted that striving for liberation would simply create more delusion.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}}{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} One has simply to recognize the nature of one's own mind, which is naturally empty (''stong pa''), luminous ('''od gsal ba''), and pure.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} According to Germano, its characteristic language, which is marked by naturalism and negation, is already pronounced in some Indian tantras.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} Nevertheless, these texts are still inextricably bound up with tantric [[Mahayoga]], with its visualisations of deities and mandals, and complex initiations.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}}\n\nDuring the 9th and 10th centuries these texts, which represent the dominant form of the tradition in the 9th and 10th centuries,{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} were gradually transformed into full-fledged tantras, culminating in the [[Kulayar\u0101ja Tantra]] (''kun byed rgyal po'', \"The All-Creating King\"{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}}), in the last half of the 10th or the first half of the 11th century.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} According to Germano, this tantra was historically perhaps the most important and widely quoted of all Dzogchen scriptures.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}}\n\n====Transformation \u2013 the Space and Instruction series (11th\u201314th century)====\nEarly Dzogchen was completely transformed in the 11th century,{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} with the [[History of Tibet#Era of Fragmentation|renaissance of Tibetan culture]] occurring from the late 10th century to the early 12th century,{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}}known as the later dissemination of Buddhism.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} New techniques and doctrines were introduced from India, resulting in new schools of Tibetan Buddhism,{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}}{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} and radical new developments in Dzogchen doctrine and practice, with a growing emphasis on meditative practice.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} The older Bon and Nyingma traditions incorporated these new influences through the process of [[Terma (religion)|Treasure revelation]].{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} Especially the ''[[yogini]]'' tantras were influential, involving horrific imagery and violent rituals, erotic imagery, and sexual and somatic practices.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546}} These influences are reflected in the rise of [[subtle body]] representations and practices, new pantheons of wrathful and erotic Buddhas, increasingly [[Antinomianism|antinomium]] rhetorics, and a focus on death-motifs.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2546-2547}}\n\nThese influences were incorporated in several movements such as the \"Secret Cycle\" (''gsang skor''),{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2547}} \"Ultra Pith\" (''yang tig''),{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2547}} \"Brahmin's tradition\" (''bram ze'i lugs''),{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2547}}{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2547}} the \"Space Class Series,\"{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} and especially the \"Instruction Class series\",{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} which culminated in the \"Seminal Heart\" (''snying thig''), which emerged in the late 11th and early 12th century.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2547}}\n\nThe \"Seminal Heart\" belongs to the \"Instruction series.\"{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2547}} The main texts of the instruction series are the so-called [[seventeen tantras]] and the two \"seminal heart\" collections, namely the ''[[Vima Nyingtik|bi ma snying thig]]'' (''Vima Nyingthig'',{{sfn|Stewart MacKenzie|2014}} \"Seminal Heart of Vimalamitra\") and the ''mkha' 'gro snying thig'' (''Khandro nyingthig'',{{sfn|Stewart MacKenzie|2014}} \"Seminal Heart of the Dakini\").{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} The \"Seminal Heart of Vimalamitra\" is attributed to Vimalamitra, but was largely composed by their discoverers, in the 11th and 12th century.{{sfn|Germano|Gyatso|2001|p=244}} The \"Seminal Heart of the Dakini\" was produced by Tsultrim Dorje (''Tshul khrims rdo rje'')(1291-1315/17).{{sfn|Germano|Gyatso|2001|p=244}}\n\nThe Seminal Heart teachings became the dominant Dzogchen-teachings,{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}} but was also criticized by conservative strands within the Nyingma-school.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}} The most important Nyingma of the 12th century, Nyangrel Nyingma \u00d6zer (''Nyang ral nyi ma 'od zer'', 1136\u20131204{{refn|group=note|In the eleventh and twelfth centuries there were several competing terma traditions surrounding [[Vimalamitra]], [[Songtsen Gampo]], [[Vairotsana]] and

He systematized the Seminal Heart teachings{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}} and other collections of texts that were circulating at the time in Tibet,{{sfn|Irons|2008|p=169}} in the [[Seven Treasuries]] (''mdzod bdun''), the \"Trilogy of Natural Freedom\" (''rang grol skor gsum''), and the [[Trilogy of Natural Ease]] (''ngal gso skor gsum'').{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}}{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}} Longchenpa refined the terminology and interpretations, and integrated the Seminal Heart teachings with broader Mahayana literature.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2548}}\n\nMalcolm Smith notes that Longchenpa's ''Tshig don mdzod,'' the [[Seven Treasuries|\"Treasury of Subjects,\"]]<ref group=web name=\"MS\">[http://www.atikosha.org/2012/09/a-preliminary-note-on-vimalamitras.html Malcolm Smith, ''A Preliminary Note on Vimalamitra's Aural Lineage '']</ref> was preceded by several other texts by other authors dealing with the same topics.<ref group=web name=\"MS\"/> Smith mentions the 12th century text \"The Eleven Subjects of The Great Perfection\"{{refn|group=note|''rdzogs pa chen po tshig don bcu gcig pa bzhugs so''}} by Nyi 'bum.

Different forms of shes pa include ''ye shes'' ([[J\u00f1\u0101na]], 'pristine consciousness') and ''shes rab'' ([[Praj\u00f1\u0101 (Buddhism)|praj\u00f1\u0101]], wisdom).<ref>Smith, Malcom; BUDDHAHOOD IN THIS LIFE, The Great Commentary by Vimalamitra, pg 12.</ref> According to [[Sam van Schaik]], two significant terms used in Dzogchen literature is the Ground (''gzhi'') and Gnosis (''rig pa''), which represent the \"ontological and gnoseological aspects of the nirvanic state\" respectively.<ref>Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, p. 52.</ref> Dzogchen literature also describes nirvana as the \"expanse\" (''klong'' or ''dbyings'') or the \"true expanse\" (''chos dbyings'', Sanskrit: [[Dharmadhatu]]). The term [[Dharmakaya]] is also often associated with these terms in Dzogchen,<ref>Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 52.</ref> as explained by [[Tulku Urgyen]]:\n<blockquote>Dharmakaya is like space. You cannot say there is any limit to space in any direction. No matter how far you go, you never reach a point where space stops and that is the end of space. Space is infinite in all directions; so is dharmakaya. Dharmakaya is all-pervasive and totally infinite, beyond any confines or limitations. This is so for the dharmakaya of all buddhas. There is no individual dharmakaya for each buddha, as there is no individual space for each country.<ref>Erik Pema Kunsang; Wellsprings of the Great Perfection The Lives and Insights of the Early Masters, p. 3</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Malcolm Smith, the Dzogchen view is also based on the Indian Buddhist [[Buddha-nature]] doctrine of the [[Tath\u0101gatagarbha s\u016btras]].<ref>Smith, Malcom; BUDDHAHOOD IN THIS LIFE, The Great Commentary by Vimalamitra, pg 15.</ref> According to the 14th Dalai Lama the Ground is the Buddha-nature, the nature of mind which is emptiness.<ref> The (14th) Dalai Lama (2000), ''Dzogchen: Heart Essence of the Great Perfection'', p.109</ref> According to Rinpoche Thrangu, [[Rangjung Dorje]] (1284\u20131339), the third Karmapa Lama (head of the Karma Kagyu) and Nyingma lineage holder, also stated that the Ground is Buddha-nature.{{refn|group=note|Rangjung Dorje also influenced [[Dolpopa]].

The knowledge that ensues from recognizing this mirror-like clarity (which cannot be found by searching nor identified){{sfn|Third Dzogchen Rinpoche|2008|p=152}} is called [[rigpa]].{{sfn|Namdak|2006|p=97}}\n\nAccording to [[Alexander Berzin (scholar)|Alexander Berzin]], there are three aspects of rigpa:<ref group=web name=\"Berzin-Major Facets\" />\n# The essential nature of rigpa: primal purity (ka-dag). Rigpa is primordially without stains, both being self-void (''rang-stong'') and other-void (''gzhan-stong'');\n# The influencing nature of rigpa: the manner in which rigpa influences others. Rigpa is responsiveness (''thugs-rje'', compassion). It responds effortlessly and spontaneously to others with compassion;\n# The functional nature of rigpa: rigpa effortlessly and spontaneously establishes \"appearances\" (''lhun-grub'').\n\nAs Berzin notes, all of the good qualities (''yon-tan'') of a Buddha are already \"are innate (''lhan-skyes'') to rigpa, which means that they arise simultaneously with each moment of rigpa, and primordial (''gnyugs-ma''), in the sense of having no beginning.<ref group=web name=\"Berzin-Major Facets\" />\n\nSam van Schaik translates rigpa as \"[[gnosis]]\" which he glosses as \"a form of awareness aligned to the nirvanic state\".<ref>Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 54.</ref> He notes that other definitions of rigpa include \"free from elaborations\" (''srpos bral''), \"non conceptual\" (''rtog med'') and \"transcendent of the intellect\" (''blo 'das''). It is also often paired with emptiness, as in the contraction ''rig stong'' (gnosis-emptiness).<ref>Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 54.</ref>\n\nJohn W. Pettit notes that ''rigpa'' is seen as beyond affirmation and negation, acceptance and rejection, and therefore it is known as \"natural\" (''ma bcos pa'') and \"effortless\" (''rtsol med'') once recognized.<ref>Pettit, John W; Mipham's Beacon of Certainty: Illuminating the View of Dzogchen, 1999, page 78</ref> Because of this, Dzogchen is also known as the pinnacle and final destination of all paths.\n\n===Ma Rigpa===\n''Ma Rigpa'' ([[Avidy\u0101 (Buddhism)|avidy\u0101]]) is the opposite of rigpa or knowledge. ''Ma rigpa'' is ignorance or unawareness, the failure to recognize the nature of the basis. An important theme in Dzogchen texts is explaining how ignorance arises from the basis or [[Dharmata]], which is associated with ''ye shes'' or 'pristine consciousness'.<ref>Smith, Malcom; BUDDHAHOOD IN THIS LIFE, The Great Commentary by Vimalamitra, pg 14.</ref> Automatically arising unawareness (''lhan-skyes ma-rigpa'') exists because the basis is seen having a natural cognitive potentiality and luminosity (''gdangs''), which is the ground for [[samsara]] and [[nirvana]]. When consciousness fails to recognize that all phenomena arise as the creativity (''rtsal'') of the nature of mind and misses its own luminescence or does not \"recognize its own face\", sentient beings arise instead of Buddhas. As explained by [[Tulku Urgyen]]:\n\n<blockquote>In the case of an ignorant sentient being the mind is called empty cognizance suffused with ignorance (marigpa). The mind of all the Buddhas is called empty cognizance suffused with awareness (rigpa).<ref>Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche; Repeating the Words of the Buddha, page 44</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to [[Vimalamitra]]'s ''Illuminating Lamp'', delusion arises because sentient beings \"lapse towards external mentally apprehended objects\". This external grasping is then said to produce sentient beings out of [[dependent origination]].<ref>Smith, Malcom; BUDDHAHOOD IN THIS LIFE, The Great Commentary by Vimalamitra, pg 20.</ref> This dualistic conceptualizing process which leads to samsara is termed [[Manas-vijnana|manas]] as well as \"awareness moving away from the ground\".<ref>Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 56.</ref>\n\n===Immanence and Distinction===\n[[File:Dzong.jpg|thumb|The [[Garuda]] is used as a symbol of primordial nature, which is already completely perfect, since this mythological animal is said to be born fully grown.<ref>Sogyal Rinpoche, The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying, page 109.</ref>]]\nAccording to Sam van Schaik, there is a certain tension in Dzogchen thought (as in other forms of Buddhism) between the idea that [[samsara]] and [[nirvana]] are immanent within each other and yet are still different. In texts such as the [[Longchen Nyingtig]] for example, the basis and rigpa are presented as being \"intrinsically innate to the individual mind\".<ref>Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 54.</ref> The ''Great Perfection Tantra of the Expanse of Samantabhadra\u2019s Wisdom'' states:\n\n<blockquote>If you think that he who is called \u201cthe heart essence of all buddhas, the Primordial Lord, the noble Victorious One, Samantabhadra\u201d is contained in a mindstream separate from the ocean-like realm of sentient beings, then this is a nihilistic view in which samsara and nirvana remain unconnected.<ref>Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 55.</ref></blockquote>\n\nLikewise, [[Longchenpa]] (12th century), writes in his ''Illuminating Sunlight'':\n\n<blockquote>Every type of experiential content belonging to samsara and nirvana has, as its very basis, a natural state that is a spontaneously present buddha\u2014a dimension of purity and perfection, that is perfect by nature. This natural state is not created by a profound buddha nor by a clever sentient being. Independent of causality, causes did not produce it and conditions can not make it perish. This state is one of self-existing wakefulness, defying all that words can describe, in a way that also transcends the reach of the intellect and thoughts. It is within the nonarising vastness of such a basic natural state that all phenomena belonging to samsara and nirvana are, essentially and without any exception, a state of buddha\u2014purity and perfection.<ref>Erik Pema Kunsang; Wellsprings of the Great Perfection The Lives and Insights of the Early Masters, page 1</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis lack of difference between these two states, their [[non-dual]] (''advaya'') nature, corresponds with the idea that change from one to another doesn't happen due to an ordinary process of causation but is an instantaneous and perfect 'self-recognition' (''rang ngo sprod'') of what is already innately (''lhan-skyes'') there.<ref>Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 56.</ref> According to John W. Pettit, this idea has its roots in Indian texts such as [[Nagarjuna]]'s [[Mulamadhyamakakarika]], which states that samsara and nirvana are not separate and that there is no difference between the \"doer\", the \"going\" and the \"going to\" (i.e. the ground, path and fruit).<ref>Pettit, John W.; Mipham's Beacon of Certainty: Illuminating the View of Dzogchen, 1999, page 78</ref>\n\nIn spite of this emphasis on immanence, Dzogchen texts do indicate a subtle difference between terms associated with delusion (''kun gzhi'' or ''alaya'', ''sems'' or mind) and terms associated with full enlightenment (''dharmakaya'' and ''rigpa'').<ref>Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 57.</ref> The Alaya and [[\u0100layavij\u00f1\u0101na]] are associated with karmic imprints (''vasana'') of the mind and with mental afflictions (''klesa''). The \"alaya for habits\" is the basis (''gzhi'') along with ignorance (''marigpa'') which includes all sorts of obscuring habits and grasping tendencies.<ref group=web name=\"Berzin-Major Facets\" />\n\nThese terms stem from Indian [[Yogacara]] texts, such as the [[Ratnagotravibh\u0101ga]].<ref>Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, page 59.</ref>\n\n===Harmonisation with Madhyamaka===\nKoppl notes that although later Nyingma authors such as [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Mipham]] attempted to harmonize the view of Dzogchen with [[Madhyamaka]], the earlier Nyingma author [[Rongzom Chokyi Zangpo]] did not.{{sfn|Koppl|2008}}{{refn|group=quote|Heidi Koppl: \"Unlike Mipham, Rongzom did not attempt to harmonize the view of Mantra or Dzogchen with Madhyamaka.\"{{sfn|Koppl|2008}}}} Rongzom held that the views of sutra such as Madhyamaka were inferior to that of tantra.{{sfn|Koppl|2008|p=ch4}}{{refn|group=quote|Heidi Koppl: \"By now we have seen that Rongzom regards the views of the Sutrayana as inferior to those of Mantra, and he underscores his commitment to the purity of all phenomena by criticizing the Madhyamaka objectification of the authentic relative truth.\"{{sfn|Koppl|2008}}}} In contrast, the 14th Dalai Lama, in his book Dzogchen, <ref>the Dalai Lama, Dzogchen p. 158 (Snow Lion 2004)</ref> concludes that Madhyamaka and Dzogchen come down to the same point. The view of reality obtained through Madhyamaka philosophy and the Dzogchen view of Rigpa can be regarded as identical. With regard to the practice in these traditions, however, at the initial stages there do seem certain differences in practice and emphasis.\n\n==Teachings and practice==\nDzogchen is a secret teaching emphasizing the rigpa view. It is a secret from those who are incapable of receiving it. The student can properly receive it with direct in-person realization under a guru's instruction. It is accessible to all; however, it is generally considered an advanced practice because safety from generating an incorrect view necessitates preliminary practices with a teacher's empowerment. {{sfn|Ingram|1993|}}\n\nDzogchen teachings emphasize naturalness, spontaneity and simplicity.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2545}} Although Dzogchen is portrayed as being distinct from tantra, it has incorporated many concepts and practices from tantric Buddhism.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2545}} It embraces a widely varied array of traditions, that range from a systematic rejection of all tantric practices, to a full incorporation of tantric practices.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2545}}\n\n===Three principles===\nThe [[Vima Nyingtik|\"Seminal Heart of Vimalamitra\"]] epitomized the Dzogchen teaching in three principles, known as the Three Statements of Garab Dorje (Tsik Sum N\u00e9 Dek). They give in short the development a student has to undergo:\n#Direct introduction to one's own nature (Tib. ''ngo rang thog tu sprod pa''), namely ''rigpa'';\n#Not remaining in doubt concerning this unique state (Tib. ''thag gcig thog tu bcad pa'');\n#Continuing to remain in this state (Tib. ''gdeng grol thog tu bca' pa'').\n\nIn subsequent centuries these teachings were expanded, most notably in the [[Longchen Nyingthig]] by [[Jigme Lingpa]] (1730\u20131798).{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} His systematisation is the most widely used Dzogchen-teaching nowadays.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}}\n\n===Structure of practice===\n\n\n====Anthology of practices====\nThe dzogchen teachings consist of vast anthologies of practices presented as preliminary and auxiliary contemplative techniques, including standard Buddhist meditation techniques and tantra practices which have been integrated into Dzogchen.{{sfn|Germano|2005|p=2547, 2548}}\n\nLongchenpa, in \"Finding Comfort and Ease in Meditation\" (''bsam gtan ngal gso''), the second text of the [[Trilogy of Natural Ease]] (''ngal gso skor gsum''),{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=254}} and its auto-commentary the ''Shing rta rnam dag'',{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=255}} uses the standard triad of meditative experiences (''nyams'') to structure the text and the practices: bliss (''bde ba''), radiance/clarity (''gsal ba''), and non-conceptuality (''mi rtog pa'').{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=254}} This triad is also presented as preliminaries, main practice, and concluding phase.{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=255}} The preliminaries are further divided into:\n* the general preliminaries on impermanence and renunciation of cyclic existence, which corresponds to the [[Therevada]]; \n* the special preliminaries on compassion and the engendering of compassionate motivation, which corresponds with the [[Mahayana]]; \n* the supreme preliminaries, consisting of the generation phase, perfection phase and Guru yoga.{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=255}}\n\nThis systematisation contextualized the system in terms of Tibetan Buddhism, while simultaneously relegating these preliminaries to a lower status, while emphasizing their necessity.{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=255}} Longchenpa couples meditation with Guru yoga in these preliminaries.{{sfn|Germano|1994|p=255}}\n\nThe teachings based on the ''Longchen Nyingthig'' are divided into preliminary practices and main practices.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation group|1994}} Alexander Berzin explicitly mentions meditative practices as a preliminary of the main practice.<ref group=web name=\"Berzin-Major Facets\">[http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/vajrayana/dzogchen-advanced/the-major-facets-of-dzogchen Alexander Berzin, ''The Major Facets of Dzogchen'']</ref>{{sfn|Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche|2001}}{{sfn|Pettit|1999|p=81}}{{sfn|Patrul Rinpoche|2011}}\n\n====General overview====\nA general overview gives the following:\n* Preliminary practices:\n** Initial empowerment: according to Tsoknyi Rinpoche, Dzogchen practice starts with receiving empowerment;{{sfn|Tsoknyi Rinpoche|2004|p=4}} \n** ''[[Ngondro]]'', general or outer, and special or inner preliminary practices, which prepare one for the main practice;\n* Great Perfection practice:\n** Further empowerment: receiving an empowerment (''dbang'', initiation) and keeping the vows conferred at that time.

(See also [[Ego death]]).

Linking the letter with one's breathing, it goes out into space with each exhalation and returns to the tip of the nose with each inhalation. This fixation inhibits the arising of extraneous thoughts [...] however, the second exercise in the same category involves the sounding of the syllable PHAT! which instantly shatters one's thoughts and attachments. Symbolically, the two parts of the syllable indicate the two aspects of enlightenment, that is, PHA signifies Means (''thabs'') and TA signifies Wisdom (''shes rab'').\"{{sfn|Reynolds|1996|p=81}}}}\n\nAccording to Reynolds, it is this specific ''Semdzin'' practice which was used by Patrul Rinpoche to provide a direct introduction to the knowledge of ''rigpa''.

But one doesn't keep hold of this knife either; one lets the knife go, so there is a gap. When you cut through again and again in this way, the string of thought falls to pieces. If you cut a rosary in a few places, at some point it doesn't work any longer.{{sfn|Schmidt|2002|p=38}}\n* Namkhai Norbu: \"Once one has arrived at contemplation through any method, one has to continue in it, and working to bring this continuation into every action and situation is called ''Tregch\u00f6d'', which literally means \"(spontaneous cutting of tension,\" in thes ense that as soon as the primordial state manifests and dualism is thus overcome, on einstantly falls into a state of total relaxation, like a bundle of sticks, that, having been bound together, falls loosely into a total relaxed pattern as soon as the string binding it has been cut.\"{{sfn|Norbu|2000|p=130}}}} Students receive [[pointing-out instruction]] (''sems khrid'', ''ngos sprod'') in which a teacher introduces the student to the nature of his or her mind.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2014}} According to Tsoknyi Rinpoche, these instructions are received after the preliminary practices, though there's also a tradition to give them before the preliminary practices.{{sfn|Tsoknyi Rinpoche|2004|p=7}}{{refn|group=quote|Tsoknyi Rinpoche: \"As for my own personal experience, when I underwent the ngondro training, I had already received some Dzogchen instructions.

If one observes the mind and searches for where a thought (''rnam-rtog'') arises, where it remains, and where it goes, no matter how much one researches and investigates this, one will find nothing. It is this very \"unfindability\" (''mi rnyed'') of the arising, the abiding, and the passing away of thoughts which is the greatest of all finds. Thoughts do not arise from anywhere (''byung sa med''), they do not remain anywhere (''gnas sa med''), and they do not go anywhere ('''gro sa med''). They do not arise from within the body, nor do they arise from outside the body. They are truly without any root or source (''ghzi med rsta bral''). Like the clouds in the sky, they arise only to dissolve again. Thoughts arise out of the state of emptiness and return again into this state of emptiness, which represents pure potentiality. We only have to observe our mind to discover this for ourselves.

Then, one famous evening, Patrul Rinpoche gave him the introduction. It happened when they were staying together in one of the hermitages high up in the mountains above Dzogchen Monastery. It was a very beautiful night. The dark blue sky was clear and the stars shone brilliantly. The sound of their solitude was heightened by the distant barking of a dog from the monastery below. Patrul Rinpoche was lying stretched out on the ground, doing a special Dzogchen practice. He called Nyoshul Lungtok over to him, saying: \"Did you say you do not know the essence of Mind?\" Nyoshul Lungtok guessed from his tone that this was a special moment and nodded expectantly.<br>\"There's nothing to it really,\" Patrul Rinpoche said casually, and added, \"My son, come and lie down over here: be like your old father.\" Nyoshul Lungtok stretched out by his side.
