Business jets may be adapted for other roles, such as the evacuation of casualties or express parcel deliveries, and some are used by public bodies, [[government official]]s or the [[armed forces]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:NASA JetStar.jpg|thumb|The [[Lockheed JetStar]] is the earliest business jet]]\n\n=== 1950s first flight ===\nThe [[Lockheed JetStar]], seating ten passengers and two crew, first flew on 4 September 1957. A total of 204 aircraft were produced from 1957 to 1978 powered by several different engines; four {{convert|3300|lbf|kN}} [[Pratt & Whitney JT12]] [[turbojet]]s, then [[Garrett TFE731]] turbofans for a {{convert|44500|lb|t}} [[MTOW]], then two [[General Electric CF700]] turbofans.\n\nThe smaller, {{convert|17760|lb|t}} MTOW [[North American Sabreliner]] first flew on 16 September 1958. Powered by two [[Pratt & Whitney JT12]] turbojet engines then [[Garrett TFE731]]s, more than 800 were produced from 1959 to 1982.\n\n=== 1960s first flight ===\n[[File:Air Zoo Learjet II.JPG|thumb|The 1963 [[Learjet 23]] was the first light jet.]]\n[[File:Grumman G-1159 Gulfstream II-SP AN0489926.jpg|thumb|The first large, long range jet was the [[Grumman Gulfstream II]] in 1966.]]\n\nThe {{convert|25000|lb|t}} MTOW [[British Aerospace 125]] first flew on 13 August 1962 as the de Havilland DH.125, powered by two {{convert|3000|lbf|kN}}  [[Armstrong Siddeley Viper]] turbojets. Its engines were replaced by Garrett TFE731s, then [[Pratt & Whitney Canada PW300]] turbofans. Almost 1,700 aircraft of all variants, including the [[Hawker 800]], were produced between 1962 and 2013.\n\nThe Aero Commander 1121 Jet Commander, which later became the [[IAI Westwind]], first flew on 27 January 1963, powered by two [[General Electric CJ610]] turbojets, then [[Garrett TFE731]]s. Production of Jet Commanders and Westwinds from 1965 to 1987 came to 442 aircraft; and it was developed as the [[IAI Astra]], later re-branded as the [[Gulfstream G100]].\n\nThe {{convert|29,000|lb|t}} MOTW [[Dassault Falcon 20]] first flew on 4 May 1963, powered by two [[General Electric CF700]]s, then [[Garrett ATF3]] turbofans and [[Garrett TFE731]]s. A total of 508 were built from 1963 to 1988, and it is the basis of the [[Dassault Falcon]] family.\n\nThe first light jet first flew on 7 October 1963 : the [[Learjet 23]]. Powered by two {{convert|2,850|lbf|kN}} [[General Electric CJ610]]s, its {{convert|12,500|lb|t}} MTOW complies with [[FAR Part 23]] regulations. The first member of the [[Learjet]] family, 104 were built between 1962 and 1966.\n\nThe forward wing sweep, {{convert|20,280|lb|t}} MOTW [[Hamburger Flugzeugbau HFB 320 Hansa Jet]] first flew on 21 April 1964, powered by two General Electric CJ610s; 47 were built between 1965 and 1973.\nThe joint Piaggo-Douglas, {{convert|18,000|lb|t}} MOTW [[Piaggio PD.808]] first flew on 29 August 1964, powered by two [[Armstrong Siddeley Viper]]s, 24 were built for the Italian Air Force.\n\nOn 2 October 1966 the first large business jet first flew, the {{convert|65,500|lb|t}} MTOW [[Grumman Gulfstream II]], powered by two {{convert|11,400|lbf|kN}} [[Rolls-Royce Spey]] turbofans. From 1967 to the late 70s, 258 were built and it led to the ongoing [[Gulfstream Aerospace]] long range family.\n\nThe {{convert|11,850|lb|t}} MTOW [[Cessna Citation I]] first flew on 15 September 1969, powered by two {{convert|2,200|lbf|kN}} [[Pratt & Whitney Canada JT15D]] turbofans. Produced between 1969 and 1985 for a total of 689 examples, it is the first of the [[Cessna Citation family]].\n\n=== 1970s first flight ===\n\nThe trijet [[Dassault Falcon 50]] made its first flight on 7 November 1976. The {{convert|40000|lb|t}} MTOW airplane is powered by three {{convert|3700|lbf|kN}} TFE731 engines. With the cross-section of the Falcon 20, it is the basis of the larger [[Falcon 900]].\n\nOn 8 November 1978, the prototype [[Canadair Challenger]] took off. The {{convert|43000|-|48000|lb|t}} MTOW craft, usually powered by two {{convert|9200|lbf|kN}} [[General Electric CF34]]s, formed the basis of the long range [[Bombardier Global Express]] family and of the [[Bombardier CRJ]] regional airliners. The 1000th Challenger entered service in 2015.\n\nOn 30 May 1979 the clean-sheet {{convert|22,000|lb|t}} MTOW [[Cessna Citation III]] took off for the first time, powered by two {{convert|3,650|lbf|kN}} TFE731s.\n\nThe [[Mitsubishi MU-300 Diamond]] made its first flight on 29 August 1978. The {{convert|16,100|lb|t}} MTOW jet was powered by two {{convert|2,900|lbf|kN}} [[JT15D]]. The design was later sold and was renamed Beechjet 400 then [[Hawker 400]], with a total of 950 produced of all variants.\n\n=== 1980s first flight ===\n\nThe 1980s only saw the introduction of derivatives and no major new designs. Also there was an advent of fractional ownership in the late 1980s for business jets.<ref>{{cite web |title=Business jet travel for the masses could come from Uber-like concept. |url=https://www.kansas.com/news/business/aviation/article120969743.html |website=Wichita Eagle |publisher=Wichita Eagle |accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== 1990s first flight ===\n\nThe first flight of the clean-sheet [[Learjet 45]] was on 7 October 1995. All of the 642 aircraft built since then have been powered by two {{convert|3,500|lbf|kN}} TFE731 engines.\n\nPowered by two {{convert|2,300|lbf|kN}} [[Williams FJ44]]s, the {{convert|12,500|lb|t}} [[Beechcraft Premier I]] light jet made its first flight on 22 December 1998. Nearly 300 had been made before production stopped in 2013.\n\n=== 2000s first flight ===\n\nIn the opposite way compared to Bombardier, which developed airliners from a business jet, Embraer derived the [[Legacy 600]] from the [[Embraer ERJ family]] of regional jet airliners. Powered by two {{convert|39.2|kN|lbf|order=flip}} [[Rolls-Royce AE 3007]]s, the first flight of the {{convert|22.5|t|lb|order=flip}} aircraft was on 31 March 2001.\n\nOn 14 August 2001, the [[Bombardier Challenger 300]] made its first flight. The {{convert|38,850|lb|t}} aircraft is powered by two {{convert|6,825|lbf|kN}} [[HTF7000]]s. The 500th example was delivered in 2015.\n\nThe first very light jet, the {{convert|5,950|lb|t}} MTOW [[Eclipse 500]], took off for the first time on 26 August 2002, powered by two {{convert|900|lbf|kN}} [[Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600]]s. Between then and the end of production in 2008, 260 were produced.\n\nIt was followed by the {{convert|8645|lb|t}} MTOW [[Cessna Citation Mustang]] on 23 April 2005, powered by two {{convert|1460|lbf|kN}} Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600s and with more than 450 produced.\n\nThen the [[Embraer Phenom 100]] made its maiden flight on 26 July 2007. The {{convert|4.75|t|lb|order=flip}} MTOW airplane is powered by two {{convert|7.2|kN|lbf|order=flip}} Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600s. With its [[Phenom 300]] development, nearly 600 have been built.\n\n=== 2010s first flight ===\n\nThe first flight of the midsize, [[fly-by-wire]], {{cvt|7,000|lbf|kN}} [[Honeywell HTF7000]]-powered [[Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600|Embraer Legacy 500]] was on 27 November 2012.

[[Ford Motor Company]], [[Chrysler]], and [[Altria]] are examples of companies that own, maintain and operate their own fleet of private aircraft for their employees. Flight departments handle all aspects of aircraft operation and maintenance. In the United States, flight-department aircraft operate under [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Organization|FAR 91]] operating rules.\n\nA 2010 study by the United States [[National Business Aviation Association]] found that small and midsize companies that use private jets produce a 219% higher earnings growth rate than those that strictly use airlines.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.nbaa.org/business-aviation/NEXA-Report-Part-2-2010.pdf |title= Business aviation : an enterprise value perspective |publisher= [[National Business Aviation Association]] |date= Fall 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Charter companies===\nCharter operators own or manage private jets for multiple clients. Like traditional flight departments, charter companies handle all aspects of aircraft operation and maintenance. However, they are not aligned with just one corporation. They manage aircraft for a private owner or corporation and also handle the sales of available flight time on the aircraft they own or manage. Maintenance services can also be provided.\n\nIn the United States, business aircraft may be operated under either FAR 91 as private operations for the business purposes of the owner, or under [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Organization|FAR 135]] of the Federal Aviation Regulations as commercial operations for the business purposes of a third party. One common arrangement for operational flexibility purposes is for the aircraft's owner to operate the aircraft under FAR 91 when needed for its own purposes, and to allow a third-party charter-manager to operate it under FAR 135 when the aircraft is needed for the business purposes of third parties (such as for other entities within the corporate group of the aircraft's owner).<ref>{{cite web|last=Epstein|first=Jonathan M.|title=Placing Your Aircraft With An Aircraft Charter-Management Company|url=http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/266322/Aviation/Placing+Your+Aircraft+with+an+Aircraft&email_access=on|publisher=[[Holland & Knight]]|accessdate=4 October 2013|date=1 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nAircraft charter brokers have entered the marketplace through the ease of setting up a website and business online. Aircraft charter operators are legally responsible for the safe operation of aircraft and charter brokers require no economic authority and are largely unregulated. The [[Department of Transportation]] requires that air charter brokers disclose to the consumer that they do not operate aircraft and cannot use terms like \"our fleet of aircraft\", \"we operate\", \"our charter service\" and others.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE ROLE OF AIR CHARTER BROKERS IN ARRANGING AIR TRANSPORTATION|url=https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/BrokerNoticeFinal%20Guidance.pdf|website=Department of Transportation|publisher=Department of Transportation}}</ref>\n\n===Fractional ownership===\nSince 1996 the term \"fractional jet\" has been used in connection with business aircraft owned by a consortium of companies. Under such arrangements, overhead costs such as [[aircrew member|flight crew]], hangarage and maintenance are split among the users.\n\n[[Fractional ownership of aircraft]] involves an individual or corporation that pays an upfront equity share for the cost of an aircraft. If four parties are involved, a partner would pay one-fourth of the aircraft price (a \"quarter share\"). That partner is now an equity owner in that aircraft and can sell the equity position if necessary. This also entitles the new owner to a certain number of hours of flight time on that aircraft, or any comparable aircraft in the fleet. Additional fees include monthly management fees and incidentals such as catering and ground transportation. In the United States, fractional-ownership operations may be regulated by either FAA [[Part 91 operator|part 91 or part 135]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Rules of the Game |url=https://www.bjtonline.com/business-jet-news/the-rules-of-the-game |website=Business Jet Traveler |publisher=Business Jet Traveler |accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Surveillance ===\n\nWith smaller equipment, long-range business aircraft can be modified as [[surveillance aircraft]] to perform specialized missions cost-effectively, from ground surveillance to maritime patrol:<ref>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/business-aviation/spotlight-bizjet-based-special-mission-aircraft |title= Spotlight on Bizjet-based Special Mission Aircraft |date= 10 January 2018 |author= Graham Warwick |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>\n* the {{cvt|99,500|lb}}, 6,000 nmi [[Bombardier Global 6000]] is the platform for the USAF [[Northrop Grumman E-11]]A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node, the radar-carrying ground-surveillance [[Raytheon Sentinel]] for the [[UK Royal Air Force]], and Saab's [[Globaleye]] AEW&C carrying its [[Erieye]] AESA radar as UK's [[Marshall ADG]] basis for [[Elint]]/[[Sigint]] for the [[United Arab Emirates]]; it is also the base for the proposed [[Saab AB]] Swordfish MPA and the USAF [[Lockheed Martin]] [[JSTARS#Future|J-Stars Recap]] battlefield-surveillance program, while [[Israel Aerospace Industries|IAI]]'s ELI-3360 [[Maritime patrol aircraft|MPA]] is based on the Global 5000;\n* The {{cvt|91,000|lb}}, 6,750 nmi [[Gulfstream G550]] was selected for the [[IAI EL/W-2085]] Conformal Airborne Early Warning [[AESA radar]] for Italy, Singapore and Israel (which also has IAI Sigint G550s) while [[L3 Technologies]] transfers the U.S. [[Compass Call]] electronic-attack system to the G550 CAEW-based EC-37B, like the NC-37B range-support aircraft, and will modify others for Australia's {{abbr|AISREW|Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Electronic Warfare}} program, [[Northrop Grumman]] proposes the G550 for the J-Stars Recap;\n* Dassault Aviation developed the Falcon 900 MPA and Falcon 2000 Maritime Multirole Aircraft for France (which delayed its Avsimar requirement), South Korea and the [[Japan Coast Guard]] with a mission system developed with L3 and [[Thales Group]];\n* Embraer delivered several EMB-145s as a platform for [[AEW&C]], MPA and multi-[[Military intelligence|intelligence]];\n\n==Classes==\nBusiness jets can be categorized according to their size.\n\n===Very light jets===\n{{main|Very light jet}}\n[[File:N816CW Cessna Citation Mustang (7534559132).jpg|thumb|The most-sold VLJ is the [[Cessna Citation Mustang]].]]\n\nThe [[very light jet]] (VLJ) is a classification initiated by the release of the [[Eclipse 500]],<ref name=JA/><ref name=AC/><ref name=FMvlj/> on 31 December 2006, which was originally available at around US$1.5 million, cheaper than existing business jets and comparable with turboprop aircraft.

small groups of people. Business jets may be adapted for other roles, such as the evacuation of casualties or express parcel deliveries, and some are used by public bodies, [[government official]]s or the [[armed forces]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:NASA JetStar.jpg|thumb|The [[Lockheed JetStar]] is the earliest business jet]]\n\n=== 1950s first flight ===\nThe [[Lockheed JetStar]], seating ten passengers and two crew, first flew on 4 September 1957. A total of 204 aircraft were produced from 1957 to 1978 powered by several different engines; four {{convert|3300|lbf|kN}} [[Pratt & Whitney JT12]] [[turbojet]]s, then [[Garrett TFE731]] turbofans for a {{convert|44500|lb|t}} [[MTOW]], then two [[General Electric CF700]] turbofans.\n\nThe smaller, {{convert|17760|lb|t}} MTOW [[North American Sabreliner]] first flew on 16 September 1958. Powered by two [[Pratt & Whitney JT12]] turbojet engines then [[Garrett TFE731]]s, more than 800 were produced from 1959 to 1982.\n\n=== 1960s first flight ===\n[[File:Air Zoo Learjet II.JPG|thumb|The 1963 [[Learjet 23]] was the first light jet.]]\n[[File:Grumman G-1159 Gulfstream II-SP AN0489926.jpg|thumb|The first large, long range jet was the [[Grumman Gulfstream II]] in 1966.]]\n\nThe {{convert|25000|lb|t}} MTOW [[British Aerospace 125]] first flew on 13 August 1962 as the de Havilland DH.125, powered by two {{convert|3000|lbf|kN}}  [[Armstrong Siddeley Viper]] turbojets. Its engines were replaced by Garrett TFE731s, then [[Pratt & Whitney Canada PW300]] turbofans. Almost 1,700 aircraft of all variants, including the [[Hawker 800]], were produced between 1962 and 2013.\n\nThe Aero Commander 1121 Jet Commander, which later became the [[IAI Westwind]], first flew on 27 January 1963, powered by two [[General Electric CJ610]] turbojets, then [[Garrett TFE731]]s. Production of Jet Commanders and Westwinds from 1965 to 1987 came to 442 aircraft; and it was developed as the [[IAI Astra]], later re-branded as the [[Gulfstream G100]].\n\nThe {{convert|29,000|lb|t}} MOTW [[Dassault Falcon 20]] first flew on 4 May 1963, powered by two [[General Electric CF700]]s, then [[Garrett ATF3]] turbofans and [[Garrett TFE731]]s. A total of 508 were built from 1963 to 1988, and it is the basis of the [[Dassault Falcon]] family.\n\nThe first light jet first flew on 7 October 1963 : the [[Learjet 23]]. Powered by two {{convert|2,850|lbf|kN}} [[General Electric CJ610]]s, its {{convert|12,500|lb|t}} MTOW complies with [[FAR Part 23]] regulations. The first member of the [[Learjet]] family, 104 were built between 1962 and 1966.\n\nThe forward wing sweep, {{convert|20,280|lb|t}} MOTW [[Hamburger Flugzeugbau HFB 320 Hansa Jet]] first flew on 21 April 1964, powered by two General Electric CJ610s; 47 were built between 1965 and 1973.\nThe joint Piaggo-Douglas, {{convert|18,000|lb|t}} MOTW [[Piaggio PD.808]] first flew on 29 August 1964, powered by two [[Armstrong Siddeley Viper]]s, 24 were built for the Italian Air Force.\n\nOn 2 October 1966 the first large business jet first flew, the {{convert|65,500|lb|t}} MTOW [[Grumman Gulfstream II]], powered by two {{convert|11,400|lbf|kN}} [[Rolls-Royce Spey]] turbofans. From 1967 to the late 70s, 258 were built and it led to the ongoing [[Gulfstream Aerospace]] long range family.\n\nThe {{convert|11,850|lb|t}} MTOW [[Cessna Citation I]] first flew on 15 September 1969, powered by two {{convert|2,200|lbf|kN}} [[Pratt & Whitney Canada JT15D]] turbofans. Produced between 1969 and 1985 for a total of 689 examples, it is the first of the [[Cessna Citation family]].\n\n=== 1970s first flight ===\n\nThe trijet [[Dassault Falcon 50]] made its first flight on 7 November 1976. The {{convert|40000|lb|t}} MTOW airplane is powered by three {{convert|3700|lbf|kN}} TFE731 engines. With the cross-section of the Falcon 20, it is the basis of the larger [[Falcon 900]].\n\nOn 8 November 1978, the prototype [[Canadair Challenger]] took off. The {{convert|43000|-|48000|lb|t}} MTOW craft, usually powered by two {{convert|9200|lbf|kN}} [[General Electric CF34]]s, formed the basis of the long range [[Bombardier Global Express]] family and of the [[Bombardier CRJ]] regional airliners. The 1000th Challenger entered service in 2015.\n\nOn 30 May 1979 the clean-sheet {{convert|22,000|lb|t}} MTOW [[Cessna Citation III]] took off for the first time, powered by two {{convert|3,650|lbf|kN}} TFE731s.\n\nThe [[Mitsubishi MU-300 Diamond]] made its first flight on 29 August 1978. The {{convert|16,100|lb|t}} MTOW jet was powered by two {{convert|2,900|lbf|kN}} [[JT15D]]. The design was later sold and was renamed Beechjet 400 then [[Hawker 400]], with a total of 950 produced of all variants.\n\n=== 1980s first flight ===\n\nThe 1980s only saw the introduction of derivatives and no major new designs. Also there was an advent of fractional ownership in the late 1980s for business jets.<ref>{{cite web |title=Business jet travel for the masses could come from Uber-like concept. |url=https://www.kansas.com/news/business/aviation/article120969743.html |website=Wichita Eagle |publisher=Wichita Eagle |accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== 1990s first flight ===\n\nThe first flight of the clean-sheet [[Learjet 45]] was on 7 October 1995. All of the 642 aircraft built since then have been powered by two {{convert|3,500|lbf|kN}} TFE731 engines.\n\nPowered by two {{convert|2,300|lbf|kN}} [[Williams FJ44]]s, the {{convert|12,500|lb|t}} [[Beechcraft Premier I]] light jet made its first flight on 22 December 1998. Nearly 300 had been made before production stopped in 2013.\n\n=== 2000s first flight ===\n\nIn the opposite way compared to Bombardier, which developed airliners from a business jet, Embraer derived the [[Legacy 600]] from the [[Embraer ERJ family]] of regional jet airliners. Powered by two {{convert|39.2|kN|lbf|order=flip}} [[Rolls-Royce AE 3007]]s, the first flight of the {{convert|22.5|t|lb|order=flip}} aircraft was on 31 March 2001.\n\nOn 14 August 2001, the [[Bombardier Challenger 300]] made its first flight. The {{convert|38,850|lb|t}} aircraft is powered by two {{convert|6,825|lbf|kN}} [[HTF7000]]s. The 500th example was delivered in 2015.\n\nThe first very light jet, the {{convert|5,950|lb|t}} MTOW [[Eclipse 500]], took off for the first time on 26 August 2002, powered by two {{convert|900|lbf|kN}} [[Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600]]s. Between then and the end of production in 2008, 260 were produced.\n\nIt was followed by the {{convert|8645|lb|t}} MTOW [[Cessna Citation Mustang]] on 23 April 2005, powered by two {{convert|1460|lbf|kN}} Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600s and with more than 450 produced.\n\nThen the [[Embraer Phenom 100]] made its maiden flight on 26 July 2007. The {{convert|4.75|t|lb|order=flip}} MTOW airplane is powered by two {{convert|7.2|kN|lbf|order=flip}} Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600s. With its [[Phenom 300]] development, nearly 600 have been built.\n\n=== 2010s first flight ===\n\nThe first flight of the midsize, [[fly-by-wire]], {{cvt|7,000|lbf|kN}} [[Honeywell HTF7000]]-powered [[Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600|Embraer Legacy 500]] was on 27 November 2012. It was followed by the shorter [[Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600|Legacy 450]] on 28 December 2013.\n\n=== New models ===\n[[File:Bombardier Global 7500 on static display, EBACE 2018, Le Grand-Saconnex (BL7C0578).jpg|thumb|A [[Global 7500]] prototype in 2018]]\nAfter peaking in 2008, deliveries slowed due to [[political instability]] but the industry hopes to revive demand by introducing more attractive and competitive new models, four in 2018:<ref name=AvWeek22dec2017>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/business-aviation/new-models-enter-market-where-can-business-aviation-go-next |title= As New Models Enter Market, Where Can Business Aviation Go Next? |at= New models stimulate demand, but it is getting harder to find a niche to target |date= 22 December 2017 |author= Graham Warwick |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>\n* the {{cvt|7,400|nmi|km}} range [[Bombardier Global 7500]] large-cabin jet, before the {{cvt|7,900|nmi|km}} Global 8000 in 2019;\n* the {{cvt|5,200|nmi|km}} large-cabin [[Gulfstream G500]], replacing the [[Gulfstream G450]], then the longer, {{cvt|6,500|nmi|km}} G600 eventually superseding the [[G550]];\n* the {{cvt|3,500|nmi|km}} [[Cessna Citation Longitude]] super midsize jet;\n* the superlight [[Pilatus PC-24]].\n\nIn October 2018, consultant Jetcraft expected 20 variants or new designs to enter service before 2023 (seven large, seven midsize and six small):\nin 2019 the [[Bombardier Global Express#Global 5500/6500|Global 5500/6500]], [[Gulfstream G600]], [[Citation XLS]]++ and a [[Cessna CitationJet/M2|CitationJet CJ4+]]/, while the [[Embraer Legacy 500|Embraer Praetor 500/600]] to be introduced in 2019 were predicted for 2021/2022;\nin 2020 a [[Gulfstream G750]];\nin 2021 the [[Dassault Falcon 6X]], [[Learjet 70]]XR/75XR and [[Global 7500]]XR;\nin 2022 the [[Bombardier Challenger 350|Bombardier Challenger 350XRS]];\nin 2023 the [[Citation Hemisphere]], an [[Embraer Legacy]] 700, [[Phenom 100]]V+, [[Dassault Falcon]] 9X, [[Bombardier Challenger 750]] and Gulfstream G400NG;\nin 2025 a [[Citation Mustang]] 2+.<ref name=AvWeek15oct2018>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/nbaa-2018/20-new-business-jets-way-says-jetcraft |title= 20 New Business Jets on the Way, Says Jetcraft |date= Oct 15, 2018 |author= John Morris |work= Aviation Week Network}}</ref>\n\n== Configuration ==\n\nThough the early [[Lockheed Jetstar]] had four, most production business jets have two [[jet engine]]s, mostly rear-mounted [[podded engine]].

[[Ford Motor Company]], [[Chrysler]], and [[Altria]] are examples of companies that own, maintain and operate their own fleet of private aircraft for their employees. Flight departments handle all aspects of aircraft operation and maintenance. In the United States, flight-department aircraft operate under [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Organization|FAR 91]] operating rules.\n\nA 2010 study by the United States [[National Business Aviation Association]] found that small and midsize companies that use private jets produce a 219% higher earnings growth rate than those that strictly use airlines.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.nbaa.org/business-aviation/NEXA-Report-Part-2-2010.pdf |title= Business aviation : an enterprise value perspective |publisher= [[National Business Aviation Association]] |date= Fall 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Charter companies===\nCharter operators own or manage private jets for multiple clients. Like traditional flight departments, charter companies handle all aspects of aircraft operation and maintenance. However, they are not aligned with just one corporation. They manage aircraft for a private owner or corporation and also handle the sales of available flight time on the aircraft they own or manage. Maintenance services can also be provided.\n\nIn the United States, business aircraft may be operated under either FAR 91 as private operations for the business purposes of the owner, or under [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Organization|FAR 135]] of the Federal Aviation Regulations as commercial operations for the business purposes of a third party. One common arrangement for operational flexibility purposes is for the aircraft's owner to operate the aircraft under FAR 91 when needed for its own purposes, and to allow a third-party charter-manager to operate it under FAR 135 when the aircraft is needed for the business purposes of third parties (such as for other entities within the corporate group of the aircraft's owner).<ref>{{cite web|last=Epstein|first=Jonathan M.|title=Placing Your Aircraft With An Aircraft Charter-Management Company|url=http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/266322/Aviation/Placing+Your+Aircraft+with+an+Aircraft&email_access=on|publisher=[[Holland & Knight]]|accessdate=4 October 2013|date=1 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nAircraft charter brokers have entered the marketplace through the ease of setting up a website and business online. Aircraft charter operators are legally responsible for the safe operation of aircraft and charter brokers require no economic authority and are largely unregulated. The [[Department of Transportation]] requires that air charter brokers disclose to the consumer that they do not operate aircraft and cannot use terms like \"our fleet of aircraft\", \"we operate\", \"our charter service\" and others.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE ROLE OF AIR CHARTER BROKERS IN ARRANGING AIR TRANSPORTATION|url=https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/BrokerNoticeFinal%20Guidance.pdf|website=Department of Transportation|publisher=Department of Transportation}}</ref>\n\n===Fractional ownership===\nSince 1996 the term \"fractional jet\" has been used in connection with business aircraft owned by a consortium of companies. Under such arrangements, overhead costs such as [[aircrew member|flight crew]], hangarage and maintenance are split among the users.\n\n[[Fractional ownership of aircraft]] involves an individual or corporation that pays an upfront equity share for the cost of an aircraft. If four parties are involved, a partner would pay one-fourth of the aircraft price (a \"quarter share\"). That partner is now an equity owner in that aircraft and can sell the equity position if necessary. This also entitles the new owner to a certain number of hours of flight time on that aircraft, or any comparable aircraft in the fleet. Additional fees include monthly management fees and incidentals such as catering and ground transportation. In the United States, fractional-ownership operations may be regulated by either FAA [[Part 91 operator|part 91 or part 135]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Rules of the Game |url=https://www.bjtonline.com/business-jet-news/the-rules-of-the-game |website=Business Jet Traveler |publisher=Business Jet Traveler |accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Surveillance ===\n\nWith smaller equipment, long-range business aircraft can be modified as [[surveillance aircraft]] to perform specialized missions cost-effectively, from ground surveillance to maritime patrol:<ref>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/business-aviation/spotlight-bizjet-based-special-mission-aircraft |title= Spotlight on Bizjet-based Special Mission Aircraft |date= 10 January 2018 |author= Graham Warwick |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>\n* the {{cvt|99,500|lb}}, 6,000 nmi [[Bombardier Global 6000]] is the platform for the USAF [[Northrop Grumman E-11]]A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node, the radar-carrying ground-surveillance [[Raytheon Sentinel]] for the [[UK Royal Air Force]], and Saab's [[Globaleye]] AEW&C carrying its [[Erieye]] AESA radar as UK's [[Marshall ADG]] basis for [[Elint]]/[[Sigint]] for the [[United Arab Emirates]]; it is also the base for the proposed [[Saab AB]] Swordfish MPA and the USAF [[Lockheed Martin]] [[JSTARS#Future|J-Stars Recap]] battlefield-surveillance program, while [[Israel Aerospace Industries|IAI]]'s ELI-3360 [[Maritime patrol aircraft|MPA]] is based on the Global 5000;\n* The {{cvt|91,000|lb}}, 6,750 nmi [[Gulfstream G550]] was selected for the [[IAI EL/W-2085]] Conformal Airborne Early Warning [[AESA radar]] for Italy, Singapore and Israel (which also has IAI Sigint G550s) while [[L3 Technologies]] transfers the U.S. [[Compass Call]] electronic-attack system to the G550 CAEW-based EC-37B, like the NC-37B range-support aircraft, and will modify others for Australia's {{abbr|AISREW|Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Electronic Warfare}} program, [[Northrop Grumman]] proposes the G550 for the J-Stars Recap;\n* Dassault Aviation developed the Falcon 900 MPA and Falcon 2000 Maritime Multirole Aircraft for France (which delayed its Avsimar requirement), South Korea and the [[Japan Coast Guard]] with a mission system developed with L3 and [[Thales Group]];\n* Embraer delivered several EMB-145s as a platform for [[AEW&C]], MPA and multi-[[Military intelligence|intelligence]];\n\n==Classes==\nBusiness jets can be categorized according to their size.\n\n===Very light jets===\n{{main|Very light jet}}\n[[File:N816CW Cessna Citation Mustang (7534559132).jpg|thumb|The most-sold VLJ is the [[Cessna Citation Mustang]].]]\n\nThe [[very light jet]] (VLJ) is a classification initiated by the release of the [[Eclipse 500]],<ref name=JA/><ref name=AC/><ref name=FMvlj/> on 31 December 2006, which was originally available at around US$1.5 million, cheaper than existing business jets and comparable with turboprop aircraft.
