Leviathan's liturgy is staunchly anti-capitalist and, seeks to dismantle society and impose itself as the leaders of a new way.\n\nLeviathan first became known to the heroes of Earth as a terror group who kidnapped the child of a Yemeni sheikh.

In the aftermath of Dedalus' breakout, further investigation showed that a paper-trail showed a flow of child soldiers from training camps in the central African republic of Mtamba to locations around the world, for use by Leviathan in their campaign.\n\nIn Batman Inc's struggle against Doctor Dedalus' master plan, they struck, and hit empty locations, which were in fact pre-prepared traps by Leviathan. Recovering, they realized that Dedalus was a feint, designed to make them show their hand on the eve of the war.

Talia stated Leviathan's goal was war with Batman's followers and the destruction of civilization.\n\nTalia took control of the League of Assassins and added its agents to the plan. The plan began by seeding mind-control chemicals in the Gotham food supply through the \"Dark Tower\" fast food chain, while taking control of the Brothers Grimm Syndicate, which controlled the club on Gotham's West Side. Using a combination of agents in the school system, the police, and the civil service, Leviathan worked to control Gotham's children.\n\nTalia soon tells Batman that her creation of Leviathan has been all out of spite. As revenge for denying her his love and unwavering dedication to his crusade for justice, Talia created Leviathan as an expressed antithesis of Batman Incorporated. The Heretic is eventually shown to be the eponymous \"Leviathan\" of the organization; the \"Third Batman\" that is prophesied to send Gotham into chaos and destroy it. However, the Heretic continuously fails Talia and proves himself to be just as defiant as his genetic template, the then-deceased Damian Wayne. After killing the Heretic, Talia attempts to activate a \"death ring\" around the planet, established by worldwide Leviathan agents. Batman Inc. disables the weapon, and Talia is killed by Kathy Kane. Their leader dead, the intelligence agency known as Spyral (another organization Doctor Dedalus was involved with) took over Leviathan's resources and the organization presumably collapsed in the wake of their defeat.\n\nUpon returning from the dead, Talia ordered her most trusted assassin to kill one of Leviathan's underbosses, who had the intention to reveal the existence of the organization to the U.S. authorities. Trust inside the criminal network was shattered and when Talia died and then was resurrected, she was ousted from her position as leader of Leviathan.

After Lex Luthor's defeat, a disguised Eve is at the bus stop when Margo approaches her. She informs Eve that there are many operatives of Leviathan and that Eve's work with them is not done because Leviathan would always find her. Margo ends the discussion by quoting \"Leviathan is everywhere and Leviathan is coming\". In the episode \"In Plain Sight\", Leviathan sends [[Hangmen (DC Comics)|Breathtaker]] to assassinate Elena Torres. This plan was thwarted by Supergirl and Breathtaker is remanded to [[Department of Extranormal Operations|D.E.O.]] custody. William Dey was investigating an organization with which he suspects  [[Acrata|Andrea Rojas]] is connected. In the episode \"Dangerous Liaisons\", Breathtaker was interrogated about who she works for. Leviathan later dispatches their operative \"Rip Roar\" to cause a geyser eruption in the north large enough to flood all the coastal cities. This plot is once again thwarted by Supergirl with the help of Martian Manhunter. It was mentioned that Rip Roar's armor prevents Martian Manhunter from scanning his mind while William Dey is shocked to learn that Rip Roar is actually his old friend Russel Rogers who was presumed dead. Andrea's connection with Leviathan is revealed when Margo appears in her limousine and informs her of  Rip Roar's fate. In the episode \"Confidence Women\", a flashback reveals that the male representative persuaded Andrea to take the Acrata medallion and she was subsequently used by Margo in order to kill Governor Harper. In the present, Acrata manages to free Rip Roar with the help of two Aurafacian-possessed operatives. When Rip Roar is sniped at the airport after serving his purpose, the male representative states that Leviathan still has some use for her. He also informs Andrea that her Acrata abilities came from the darkness within her instead of from the medallion that is now in [[Lena Luthor]]'s possession. The episode \"Tremors\" revealed that Rama Khan and Gememnae came from [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]'s sister planet Jarhanpur during the [[Mesozoic|Age of Dinosaurs]]. When Margo fails to reclaim the medallion, Rama Khan takes matters into his own hands. His plan involved harnessing Acrata's lifeforce to cause a supervolcano to form. After that plot failed, Gamemnae takes over Rama Khan's position.<ref name=\"tremors recap\"/> Following the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' crossover, Gamemnae carries out her plan by posing as a member of Obsidian Tech's [[board of directors]] named Gemma Cooper.\n\nThe Heretic appears as a supporting antagonist in ''[[Batman: Bad Blood]]'', voiced by [[Travis Willingham]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Batman characters}}\n{{Grant Morrison}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Grant Morrison]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2011]]\n[[Category:Fictional organized crime groups]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox comics organization <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n|name= \n|image= \n|imagesize= <!-- numeral only, defaults to 250 -->\n|caption=\n|publisher=[[DC Comics]]\n|debut=''[[Batman]]: The Return'' #1 (January 2011)\n|creators=[[Grant Morrison]] (writer)<br>[[David Finch (comics)|David Finch]] (artist)\n|type=Organized crime, terrorist\n|business=\n|organisation=\n|organization=y\n|base=\n|owners= Leviathan, formerly [[Talia al Ghul]]\n|employees=Dr. Dedalus (Otto Netz)<br>The Heretic (Fatherless)<br>[[Professor Pyg]]<br>[[Son of Pyg]]<br>Goatboy\n|fullroster=\n|cat=organized crime groups\n|subcat=DC Comics\n|sortkey=Leviathan\n|}}\n'''Leviathan''' is a fictional criminal organization in [[DC Comics]], later revealed to be a schism of the [[League of Assassins]] under the leadership of [[Talia al Ghul]], the daughter of [[Ra's al Ghul]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=180}}</ref>\n\nThe organization appears in a different form in the [[Supergirl (season 4)|fourth season]] finale and [[Supergirl (season 5)|fifth season]] of ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]''.\n\n==Publication history==\nLeviathan was introduced in ''[[Batman: The Return]]'' (Jan. 2011) and was created by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[David Finch (comics)|David Finch]].<ref>''Batman: The Return'' #1</ref>\n\n==Fictional team history==\n===First incarnation===\nLeviathan is an organization founded by [[Talia al Ghul]]; upon leaving her father, [[Ra's al Ghul]]'s [[League of Assassins]].

Their leader dead, the intelligence agency known as Spyral (another organization Doctor Dedalus was involved with) took over Leviathan's resources and the organization presumably collapsed in the wake of their defeat.\n\nUpon returning from the dead, Talia ordered her most trusted assassin to kill one of Leviathan's underbosses, who had the intention to reveal the existence of the organization to the U.S. authorities. Trust inside the criminal network was shattered and when Talia died and then was resurrected, she was ousted from her position as leader of Leviathan. The organization then fractured into various factions, guided by competing leaders.<ref>''The Silencer'' #7.

After Lex Luthor's defeat, a disguised Eve is at the bus stop when Margo approaches her. She informs Eve that there are many operatives of Leviathan and that Eve's work with them is not done because Leviathan would always find her. Margo ends the discussion by quoting \"Leviathan is everywhere and Leviathan is coming\". In the episode \"In Plain Sight\", Leviathan sends [[Hangmen (DC Comics)|Breathtaker]] to assassinate Elena Torres. This plan was thwarted by Supergirl and Breathtaker is remanded to [[Department of Extranormal Operations|D.E.O.]] custody. William Dey was investigating an organization with which he suspects  [[Acrata|Andrea Rojas]] is connected. In the episode \"Dangerous Liaisons\", Breathtaker was interrogated about who she works for. Leviathan later dispatches their operative \"Rip Roar\" to cause a geyser eruption in the north large enough to flood all the coastal cities. This plot is once again thwarted by Supergirl with the help of Martian Manhunter. It was mentioned that Rip Roar's armor prevents Martian Manhunter from scanning his mind while William Dey is shocked to learn that Rip Roar is actually his old friend Russel Rogers who was presumed dead. Andrea's connection with Leviathan is revealed when Margo appears in her limousine and informs her of  Rip Roar's fate. In the episode \"Confidence Women\", a flashback reveals that the male representative persuaded Andrea to take the Acrata medallion and she was subsequently used by Margo in order to kill Governor Harper. In the present, Acrata manages to free Rip Roar with the help of two Aurafacian-possessed operatives. When Rip Roar is sniped at the airport after serving his purpose, the male representative states that Leviathan still has some use for her. He also informs Andrea that her Acrata abilities came from the darkness within her instead of from the medallion that is now in [[Lena Luthor]]'s possession. The episode \"Tremors\" revealed that Rama Khan and Gememnae came from [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]'s sister planet Jarhanpur during the [[Mesozoic|Age of Dinosaurs]]. When Margo fails to reclaim the medallion, Rama Khan takes matters into his own hands. His plan involved harnessing Acrata's lifeforce to cause a supervolcano to form. After that plot failed, Gamemnae takes over Rama Khan's position.<ref name=\"tremors recap\"/> Following the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' crossover, Gamemnae carries out her plan by posing as a member of Obsidian Tech's [[board of directors]] named Gemma Cooper.\n\nThe Heretic appears as a supporting antagonist in ''[[Batman: Bad Blood]]'', voiced by [[Travis Willingham]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Batman characters}}\n{{Grant Morrison}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Grant Morrison]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 2011]]\n[[Category:Fictional organized crime groups]]\n", "name_user": "Neils51", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eIn other media:spelling - it's->its", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviathan_(DC_Comics)"}
