When the Metro first opened, on January 28th 2000, the station was the terminal station for both the new lines. It is a transportation hub for O.SY. buses, for the Tram as well as for taxi.

Private Newlin with four other Marines, was manning a key position on the perimeter of the [[Firebase Nong Son|Nong Son outpost]] when the enemy launched a savage and well coordinated [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] and infantry assault, seriously wounding him and killing his four comrades. Propping himself against his [[machine gun]], he poured a deadly accurate stream of fire into the charging ranks of the [[Viet Cong]]. Though repeatedly hit by [[small arms]] fire, he twice repelled enemy attempts to overrun his position. During the third attempt, a grenade explosion wounded him again and knocked him to the ground unconscious. The Viet Cong guerrillas, believing him dead, bypassed him and continued their assault on the main force. Meanwhile, Private Newlin regained consciousness, crawled back to his weapon, and brought it to bear on the rear of the enemy causing havoc and confusion among them. Spotting the enemy attempting to bring a captured 106 recoilless weapon to bear on other Marine positions, he shifted his fire, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy and preventing them from firing the captured weapon. He then shifted his fire back to the primary enemy force, causing the enemy to stop their assault on the Marine bunkers and to once again attack his machine gun position. Valiantly fighting off two more enemy assaults, he firmly held his ground until mortally wounded. Private Newlin had single-handedly broken up and disorganized the entire enemy assault force, causing them to lose momentum and delaying them long enough for his fellow Marines to organize a defense and beat off their secondary attack. His indomitable courage, fortitude, and unwavering devotion to duty in the face of almost certain death reflected great credit upon himself and the Marine Corps and upheld the highest traditions of the [[United States Department of the Navy|United States Naval Service]].\n\n/S/ [[Richard Nixon|RICHARD M.

Tej is married to Jhanvi and they have three children, Omkara, Rudra and Priyanka. Shakti is married to Pinky and has a son, Shivaay, who is the eldest grandson.\n\nShivaay manages the Oberoi empire. He does not believe in love and plans to marry Tia Kapoor on his mother's insistence. After a rocky start, Tia runs away from her own wedding and Shivaay forcibly marries Annika. After facing many difficulties Shivaay exposes Tia's marriage with Dushyant and also exposes her mother, Mrs. Kapoor's evil intentions in front of guests and family members and declares Annika as his real wife before them. Eventually, they fall in love.\n\nOmkara is an artist. He meets Ishana who wants to marry him to attain financial stability and deceives him till she is exposed by his brothers. He marries Gauri Kumari Sharma, a bubbly girl under tough circumstances. Initially Omkara detests her, misunderstanding her to be a gold digger. But Gauri brings out the artist in him once again and he eventually falls in love with her.\n\nRudra is the youngest brother and practically the baby of the family. He has no ambitions or goals in life and only loves to work out and party. Bhavya Pratap Rathore, an undercover police officer ends up using Rudra in one of her operations. Through a series of events they fall in love and marry.\n\nPriyanka is a shy, nervous and honest girl. Priyanka marries Ranveer Randhawan, a police officer who had been blackmailing her. Ranveer tries to ruin the Oberois with his foster mother Kamini Khurana, but later has a change of heart and falls in love with Priyanka.\n\nThe Kapoor sisters (Svetlana, Tia and Saumya) are the brothers' rivals. Svetlana reveals that their parents were killed in an accident at one of the Oberoi factories and therefore the sisters seek revenge with various plots. Svetlana has an affair with Tej and breaks up the family. When Tej and Jhanvi reunite, she tries to seduce their son, Omkara but fails and is eventually jailed. Tiaia eventually changes for the better when her husband Dushyant is revealed to be alive.\n\nSaumya, the last Kapoor sister, was initially introduced as a family friend, but right after Bhavya and Rudra's wedding, it is revealed she is the secret third sister of the Kapoor family. Both Svetlana and Saumya are imprisoned, but Tia is reunited with Dushyant and they have a child.\n\nShivaay's aunt, Roop, wants revenge on the Oberois for abandoning her and tries to frame them for the Kalyani Mills fire as well as killing Mr. Kapoor. While trying to save the Oberois, Shivaay learns about Annika's parents who also died in the fire. Shivaay tells Annika about her identity and reunites her with her long-lost sister who turns out to be Gauri.\n\n===Redux story===\nThe story takes a different leap, where an author and public speaker, returns all of them to where the story started and changes their lives by changing the circumstances.\n\nNow, Shivaay is a stoic, no-nonsense businessman who is hurt by his parents' death. Pinky's suicide and Shakti's discovery of his affair haunt him. Omkara is also shown as a businessman. Rudra is shown as a supermodel who uses his fame and money as an excuse for everything he does.

Previously, the nameplate [[Nash Ambassador|Ambassador]] applied to [[Nash Motors|Nash's]] full-size cars. The nameplate referred to a trim level between 1927 and 1931.\n\nAmbassadors were manufactured in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] as well as at AMC's [[Brampton Assembly]] in Brampton, Ontario from 1963 to 1966. [[Australian Motor Industries]] (AMI) assembled Ambassadors from [[knock-down kit]]s with [[right-hand drive]] from 1961 to 1963. The U.S. fifth generation Ambassadors were manufactured by [[Industrias Kaiser Argentina]] (IKA) in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina]] from 1965 to 1972, as well as assembled by ECASA in [[Costa Rica]] from 1965 to 1970. Planta REO assembled first-generation Ambassadors in Mexico at its Monterrey, Nuevo Le\u00f3n plant. Fifth and seventh generation Ambassadors were modified into custom stretch [[limousine]]s in Argentina and the U.S.\n\n== Development ==\nFollowing [[George W. Mason]]'s unexpected death in the fall of 1954, [[George W. Romney|George Romney]] (whom Mason had been grooming as his eventual successor), succeeded him as president and CEO of the newly formed American Motors. Romney recognized that to be successful in the postwar marketplace, an automobile manufacturer would have to be able to produce and sell cars in sufficient volume to [[Amortization (business)|amortize]] the high cost of tooling. Toward that end, he set out to increase AMC's market share with its Rambler models that were selling in [[market segment]] in which the domestic Big Three ([[General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company]], and [[Chrysler]]) automakers did not yet compete. While development of a redesigned 1958 Nash Ambassador, based on a stretched and reskinned 1956 Rambler [[Coachwork|body]] was almost complete, AMC's [[Automotive design|designers]] were also working on a retrimmed [[Hudson Motor Car Company|Hudson]] equivalent, called '''Rebel''', to offer Hudson [[Car dealership|dealers]].\n\nHowever, as sales of the large-sized [[Nash Ambassador]] and [[Hudson Hornet]] models slowed, it became clear to Romney that consumer confidence in the historic Nash and Hudson nameplates had collapsed. Reluctantly, he decided that 1957 would be the end of both nameplates, and the company would concentrate on the new Rambler line, which was registered as a separate [[marque]] for 1957.\n\nThe market positioning meant that \"the AMC Ambassador was a car with no real competitors throughout most of the sixties\" because it was viewed as a luxury-type car and could be put against the higher end large-sized models from the domestic Big Three automakers, but the Ambassador was more of a midsized car.<ref>{{cite book |last=Flory, Jr. |first=J. \u201cKelly\u201d |title=American Cars, 1973-1980: Every Model, Year by Year |date=2012 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786456369 |page=2 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1DiNAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2&dq=the+AMC+Ambassador+was+a+car+with+no+real+competitors+throughout+most+of+the+sixtie |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n== First generation ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image        = Rambler Ambassador (3893707660).jpg\n| caption      = 1958 Ambassador V8, Custom sedan\n| model_years  = 1958\u20131959\n| aka          = Ambassador V8 by Rambler\n| name         = First generation\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list | 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] | 4-door [[hardtop]] sedan | 4-door [[station wagon]] | 4-door [[hardtop]] station wagon }}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|117|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| transmission = 3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| engine       = {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]]\n}}\n\n=== 1958 ===\n[[File:1958 Ambassador 4-d hardtop.jpg|thumb|right|1958 Ambassador Custom hardtop sedan with [[continental tire]] ]]\n[[File:1958 Ambassador 4-d hardtop wagon 2.JPG|thumb|right|Ambassador hardtop (pillarless) Cross Country station wagon]]\n\nAmerican Motors planned to produce a stretched a {{convert|117|in|0|adj=on}} [[wheelbase]] version of the Rambler platform for Nash dealers to be the new Nash Ambassador, and another for Hudson dealers. Shortly before committing to production of the new long-wheelbase versions of the Hudson and the Nash, CEO Romney decided to abandon the Nash and Hudson marques.\n\nDespite the fact that the Nash and Hudson names were canceled, work on the car itself continued, and American Motors introduced debuted in the fall of 1957, the 1958 \"Ambassador V-8 by Rambler\" on a {{convert|117|in|0|adj=on}} wheelbase. Its features included a {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]] (equipped with a 4-barrel [[carburetor]] and dual exhausts and rated at {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|360|lb\u00b7ft|N\u00b7m}} of torque) mated to a [[BorgWarner]] supplied 3-speed [[automatic transmission]] with push button gear selection.\n\nIn 1956, AMC first produced its own V8, a modern overhead valve V8 displacing {{convert|250|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}, with a forged steel crank shaft, which when equipped with a 4-barrel carburetor was rated at {{convert|215|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. In 1957, AMC bored and stroked the 250 CID V8 to {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} displacement which when offered in the [[Rambler Rebel]] used solid lifters and Bendix electronic fuel injection was rated at {{convert|288|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn 1958, the Ambassador was equipped with a hydraulic lifter version of AMC's 327 CID V8 rated at {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. Although AMC's 327 CID V8 shares its displacement with the Chevrolet small-block, AMC's 327 came out six years before Chevrolet first offered its 327 in 1962.\n\nThe Ambassador was available in a body style exclusive to its line, a pillarless [[hardtop]] '''Cross Country''' [[station wagon]]. The 1958 Ambassador was offered in a single high level trim level and came equipped with such luxury items as electric clock, twin front and rear ashtrays, Nash tradition \"deep coil\" spring suspension front and rear, split back reclining front seats that fold down into a bed, as well as upscale fabrics for the interior.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---July/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-Brochure/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-24-25 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816085955/http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---July/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-Brochure/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-24-25 |archivedate=August 16, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nManagement had found that the public associated the Rambler name with small economy cars, and did not want the upscale nature of the new Ambassador to be so closely associated with Rambler's favorable, but economical image. Therefore, a decision was made that the larger Ambassador would be marketed as the '''Ambassador V-8 by Rambler''' in order to identify it with the Rambler name's burgeoning success, but to indicate an air of exclusivity by showing it to be a different kind of vehicle. However, the car wore \"Rambler Ambassador\" badges on its front fenders.\n\nThe 1958 Ambassador is a substantially longer car than the {{convert|108|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase [[Rambler Six]] and [[Rambler Rebel|Rebel V8]], although both lines shared the same basic body, styling, and visual cues. However, all of the Ambassador's extra {{convert|9|in|mm|spell=in}} of wheelbase (and, therefore, overall length) were added ahead of the cowl, meaning that the passenger compartment had the same volume as the smaller Ramblers. The Ambassadors came with plusher interior and exterior trims while the front end incorporated the Rebel \"V-Line\" grille from the prototype Hudson model. Through effective [[market segment]]ation, the Ambassador was [[Positioning (marketing)|positioned]] to compete with the larger models offered by other automakers.\n\nModel identification was located on the car's front fenders and deck lid. '''Super''' trim level Ambassadors featured painted side trim in a color that complemented the body color; '''Custom''' models featured a silver [[anodized aluminum]] panel on sedans and vinyl woodgrain decals on station wagons. Ambassador body styles included a four-door sedan and a [[hardtop]] sedan, a four-door pillared station wagon, and the aforementioned hardtop station wagon, a body style that first saw duty as an industry first in the 1956 [[Nash Rambler|Nash and Hudson Rambler]] line, on which all of the 1958 Ramblers were based.\n\nThe Ambassador had an excellent power-to-weight ratio for its time and provided spirited performance with [[0 to 60 mph]] (0 to 97&nbsp;km/h) times of less than 10-seconds, and low 17-second times through a quarter-mile (402&nbsp;m) [[dragstrip]]. It could be equipped with a [[limited slip differential]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---July/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-Brochure/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-20-21 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816065829/http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---July/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-Brochure/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-20-21 |archivedate=August 16, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> as well as power brakes, power steering, power windows, and [[air conditioning]].

[[Scotchlite]] reflectors were also added to the rear of the tailfins to increase visibility at night. Front and rear bumpers were over 20% thicker, and featured recessed center sections to protect [[license plates]]. Adjustable headrests were now available as an option for the front seats, an industry first. [[American Motors Corporation|AMC]] touted the added comfort the headrests provided, as well as their potential for reducing [[whiplash (medicine)|whiplash]] injuries in the event of a rear-end collision. Other changes included the activation of the starter through the neutral pushbutton (on automatic transmission equipped cars), and the addition of an optional \"Powr-Saver\" engine fan, which featured a [[Fan clutch|fluid-filled clutch]] for quieter high-speed operation.\n\nThe 1959 model year also saw the addition of an optional \"Air-Coil Ride\" [[air suspension]] system, utilizing air bags installed within the rear coil springs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/AMC/1959_AMC/1959_Rambler_Wagons/1959-Rambler-Wagons-05 |title=1959 Rambler Wagons brochure |publisher=oldcarbrochures.org |accessdate=23 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522175749/http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/AMC/1959_AMC/1959_Rambler_Wagons/1959-Rambler-Wagons-05 |archivedate=May 22, 2014 |df=mdy }}</ref> An engine-driven [[Gas compressor|compressor]], reservoir, and ride-height control valve comprised the rest of the system, but as other automakers discovered, the troublesome nature of air-suspension outweighed its benefits. [[American Motors Corporation|AMC]] discontinued the unpopular option at the end of the model year.\n\nAmbassador sales improved considerably over 1958, reaching an output of 23,769; nearly half of which were '''Custom''' four-door sedans. Much rarer was the hardtop station wagon, of which only 578 were built.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Second generation ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image        = 1960 AMC Rambler Ambassador sedan green NJ.jpg\n| caption      = 1960 Ambassador V8 by Rambler\n| model_years  = 1960\u20131961\n| aka          = Rambler Ambassador\n| name         = Second generation\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list | 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] | 4-door [[hardtop]] sedan | 4-door [[station wagon]] | 4-door [[hardtop]] station wagon }}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|117|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine       = {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]]\n}}\n\n=== 1960 ===\n1960 saw the Ambassador lineup totally reskinned, wearing new fenders, hood, deck lid, door skins, roofline, grille, taillights, bumpers, windshield, and backlight. Significant were the lower hood line, lower windshield cowl, simplified side trim, egg crate grill, while the tailfins were reduced in height and were canted to either side making for a modern and integrated appearance. The overall effect was rather fresh, as the new roof had a lower, lighter look, to complement the lower fins and grille.\n\nAll Ambassadors came equipped with the American Motors {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]], but for the first time it was available in two versions. First was the original {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|360|lb\u00b7ft|N\u00b7m|abbr=on}} of torque, performance version equipped with the 4-barrel carburetor and a 9.7:1 compression ratio, which required premium fuel, and a second economy version running on regular gasoline making {{convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|340|lb\u00b7ft|N\u00b7m|abbr=on}} of torque, equipped with a 2-barrel carburetor and an 8.7:1 compression ratio.\n\nAmbassadors now came with a unique compound curved windshield that cut into the roof. This improved visibility, did away with the \u201cknee knocker\u201d dogleg design of AMC's first generation wrap-around windshield, and resulted in an even stiffer unitized structure. The 1960 Ambassador had a low cowl which with the compound windshield afforded excellent visibility. The Ambassador was offered in higher end Custom or entry level Super trim levels. All 1960 Ambassadors came with a new instrument cluster under a padded cowl, as well as illuminated controls for lights, wipers, fan, and defrost functions. The 1960 Ambassadors continued with an enclosed drive shaft (torque tube) and coil springs at all four corners, although the suspension was revised resulting in better handling. The top-of-the-line Ambassador models came standard with individual \"airliner\" reclining front seats that now had even more luxurious fabrics than in previous years.\n\nThe Ambassador was the only American midsize, luxury high-performance car offered in 1960. The 1960 Ambassador came in 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]], 4-door pillarless hardtop, 4-door [[station wagon]], and a 4-door pillarless ([[hardtop]]) station wagon. Equipped with the 270&nbsp;horsepower 327&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in V8, and the Borg Warner pushbutton-operated 3-speed planetary gear and torque converter automatic transmission, the Ambassadors reached {{convert|60|mph|km/h|0}} in just over 9 seconds and passed the quarter-mile in 17 seconds.\n\n=== 1961 ===\n[[File:1961 Rambler Ambassador Custom blue-fl.jpg|thumb|left|1961 Rambler Ambassador Custom]]\n[[File:1961 AMC Rambler Ambassador 4-door pink rear.JPG|thumb|right|1961 Rambler Ambassador sedan]]\n\nThe 1961 Ambassador continued the previous year's {{convert|117|in|mm|0|adj=on}} basic [[Unit body|unitized platform]], but received an unusual new front-end styling that was overseen by AMC's in-house design department headed by [[Edmund E. Anderson|Edmund Anderson]]. The new face consisted of a trapezoid grille and headlights that floated in a body-colored panel, while the front fenders arched downward and forward of the leading edge of the hood. Different from anything else on the market, AMC's marketing department promoted the look as \"European.\" While the new look was meant to distinguish the Ambassador from the lower-priced Ramblers, it was neither a consumer success nor well received in the automotive press. Overall sales fell as the entire industry was experiencing a [[recession]]. The hardtop sedan and wagon models did not return for 1961.\n\nStandard was the {{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 with a [[Manual transmission#Synchronized transmission|synchromesh manual transmission]].

And while Rambler sales had been good enough for third place in industry sales (behind [[Chevrolet]] and [[Ford]]), AMC's management was working on a revolutionary and somewhat costly design set to debut for the 1963 model year. In the meantime, American Motors needed to save money, and since the Ambassador's sales had fallen in 1961, it was decided that the car would be downsized for 1962 to share its body, windshield and {{convert|108|in|0|adj=on}} wheelbase with its [[Rambler Classic|Classic]] line mate. Accordingly, the car was marketed as a '''Rambler Ambassador'''.\n\nThe 1962 Ambassador received a new front end that was very similar to the 1961\u201362 Classic's, but with a crosshatch design, recessed center section, and '''Ambassador''' lettering. New, rectangular taillights were seen at the ends of restyled rear fenders, which lost their fins entirely. Exterior trim was reshuffled, and a new 2-door pillared sedan debuted. A new '400' trim line was added at the top of the line, with Super and Custom models remaining. The Ambassador offered even more luxurious interiors, perhaps to make up for the fact that it now shared its wheelbase with the Rambler Classic. The 400 could be had with vinyl [[bucket seat]]s, headrests, and color coordinated shag carpets.\n\nThe only available engine was AMC's {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} OHV V8, in either the regular fuel, 2-barrel carburetor and 8.7:1 compression ratio, {{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} version or the premium gasoline, 4-barrel version with 9.7:1 compression ratio, {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} version. The 1962 Ambassador came with a dual chamber [[master brake cylinder]] that separated the front and rear brakes so that in the event of the failure of one chamber some braking function would remain. This design was offered by only a few cars at that time. The 1962 models were equipped with \"Walker\" (brand) flow-through mufflers. The {{convert|108|in|0|adj=on}} wheelbase 1962 Ambassador was lighter than its {{convert|117|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase predecessors and when equipped with the {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, it was a spirited performer.\n\nThe 1962, {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 Ambassador for the first time used the same {{convert|108|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase structure as did the 1957 Rambler Rebel which was also equipped with an earlier solid lifter version of the AMC 327. The 1957 Rambler Rebel equipped with a 3-speed column mounted manual transmission, was the quickest 4-door sedan made in the United States, achieving {{convert|0|to|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} [[acceleration]] in just over 7 seconds, making it faster than the Hemi [[Chrysler 300 letter series|Chrysler 300C]], the [[DeSoto Adventurer]], the Dodge D500, the Plymouth Fury, and the Chevrolet fuel-injected 283.<ref>{{cite web|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide''|title=1957-1960 Rambler Rebel |publisher=howstuffworks.com |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1957-1960-rambler-rebel1.htm |date=22 August 2007 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> The 1962 Ambassador was available with a 3-speed manual transmission and being basically the same vehicle, should also reach 60&nbsp;mph about as quickly as did the 1957 Rambler Rebel.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Fourth generation ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| model_years  = 1963\u20131964\n| image        = File:1963 Rambler Ambassador 880 sedan gold-white K-f.jpg\n| caption      = 1963 Rambler Ambassador 880 Sedan\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list | 2-door [[coupe]] (1963) | 4-door sedan | 4-door [[station wagon]] | 2-door [[hardtop]] (1964) }}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|112|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length       = {{convert|188.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width        = {{convert|71.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height       = {{convert|55.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine       = {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]]\n| name         = Fourth generation\n}}\n\n=== 1963 ===\n[[File:1963 Rambler Ambassador 990 Sedan.jpg|thumb|left|1963 Rambler Ambassador 990 Sedan]]\nIn 1962 Romney left AMC to run for [[Governor of Michigan|Governor]] of [[Michigan]], a position that he won. The automaker's new president, [[Roy Abernethy]], who was responsible for the increasing sales under Romney, reacted to the mounting competition (in 1963 AMC built as many cars as they had in 1960, but overall total car sales had increased so much that it gave AMC only sixth place in production; the same output in 1960 had put them third) in a logical way: \"Let's get rid of this Romney image.\"<ref name=\"howstuffworks1963-1964\">{{cite web|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=1963-1964 AMC/Rambler Ambassador & Classic, page 1|date=21 November 2007 |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1963-1964-amc-rambler-ambassador-classic.htm |accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nA completely redesigned larger Rambler lineup appeared.

AMC Ambassador and Classics used outerpanels stamped from single sheet metal panels which included both door frames and outer rocker panels. This resulted in an extremely rigid and rattle-free structure, better fit of doors into frames, production cost savings and reduced noise, vibration and harshness. The \"uniside\" structure was superior to the conventional production methods in which multiple smaller pieces were welded together.<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://amcrc.com/aug05feature.html |last=Isbrandt |first=Ralph H. |title=Rambler Engineering |journal=Motor Trend |date=February 1963 |publisher=AMCRC |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> There were 30% fewer parts and the result was greater structural rigidity, quieter car operation, and an overall weight reduction of about {{convert|150|lb|kg|0|abbr=off}}.<ref name=\"automotive-fleet-63\"/>\n\nCurved side glass and [[push-button]] door handles were new and costly upgrades, but contributed to the new Rambler's handsome, elegant, and modern Mercedes-like bodyside styling, by adding greater elegance in detail. At the time, curved side glass was used only in much more expensive luxury cars, but increased interior room and visibility, as well as reducing wind noise and improved proportions and styling of the cars.<ref name=\"DrivingGeorgeRomney\"/> The Ambassador also featured a squared-off [[Ford Thunderbird|Thunderbird]]-type roofline.<ref name=\"automotive-fleet-63\"/> The front end featured a forward-thrusting upper and lower ends with a vertical bar \"electric shaver\" chrome grille insert. The Ambassador's grille was differentiated from the Classic's grille by its use of the Ambassador name in script in the small horizontal bar between the upper and lower grille sections. Round quad headlights were slightly recessed in chrome bezels mounted side-by-side within the grille at its outermost edges. Overall, the new Ambassadors were described by the staff of ''Automotive Fleet'' magazine as \"probably the finest looking cars ever produced by American Motors.\"<ref name=\"automotive-fleet-63\"/>\n\nAmbassadors once again came in 2-door [[coupe]], 4-door sedan, and 4-door wagon body styles, but new trim lines debuted. A \"Mercedes-like three-number model designation was developed\" with the '''800''' as the Ambassador's base line (replacing the previous year's Super model) for the police, taxi, and fleet market, a '''880''' model (in place of the Custom), and the up level '''990''' trim (replacing the previous 400 models).<ref name=\"howstuffworks1963-1964_1\"/>\n\nThe 1963 Ambassadors were offered only with the {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, in either {{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 2-barrel or {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 4-barrel versions. AMC's smaller {{convert|287|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine was only offered in the Classic line. The automatic transmission was controlled by a steering column mounted lever, replacing the previous pushbutton system. Maintenance was reduced with service intervals of the front wheel bearings increased from {{convert|12000|-|25000|mi|km|0|abbr=off}}, the recommended engine oil change was at {{convert|4000|mi|km|0|abbr=off}}, and all Ambassador models included an [[Alternator (automotive)|alternator]] and an [[Voltage regulator|electronic voltage regulator]] as standard equipment.<ref name=\"automotive-fleet-63\"/>\n\nSales were brisk, and the redesign was billed a success, with ''[[Motor Trend]]'' Magazine bestowing '''[[Motor Trend Car of the Year|Car of the Year]]''' status on the entire 1963 Rambler line, including the Ambassador. The marketing formula for the Ambassador generated record sales for the model with buyers favoring more luxury and features as evidenced by the Ambassador 990 models outselling the 880 versions by nearly 2-to-1, while the base 800 model had a total of only 43 two-door sedans built.<ref name=\"howstuffworks1963-1964_1\"/> The automaker did not have the resources of GM, Ford, and Chrysler, nor the sales volume to spread out its new model tooling and advertising costs over large production volumes; however, Richard Teague \"turned these economical cars into smooth, streamlined beauties with tons of options and V-8 pep.\"<ref name=\"howstuffworks1963-1964\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=1963-1964 AMC/Rambler Ambassador & Classic Specifications |date=21 November 2007 |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1963-1964-amc-rambler-ambassador-classic2.htm |accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== 1964 ===\nThe 1964 model year introduced minor trim changes and new options. The \"electric-shaver\" grille on the 1963 model was replaced with a flush-mounted design, and the engine and transmission options were widened. A two-door [[hardtop]] body style called '''990-H''' was added for the first time since 1957. Base 880 and the 880 models were dropped from the line.\n\nThe 1964 Ambassadors featured the {{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 2-barrel {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 as standard, with the 4-barrel {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} version as optional. The automaker did not offer a 4-speed manual transmission to compete with the sporty mid-size V8 offerings from Ford or GM. Instead, AMC offered its innovative \u201cTwin-Stick\u201d manual transmission. The \"Twin stick\" option consisted a three-speed manual transmission, operated by one of the two console mounted \"sticks\" in conjunction with an overdrive unit that was controlled by the second \"stick\" in both 2nd and 3rd gears. This gave the driver the option of using five forward gears.

Using the experience he gained as an outstanding salesman as a guide, Abernethy closely looked at the direction that American Motors' competition was going and decided that the company would be much more successful if its products competed more directly with the Big Three. He would achieve this by pushing all AMC vehicles further upmarket among the various [[market segment]]s, shaking off the company's economy car image, and offering vehicles once again in all three major American car size classes: compact, intermediate, and full-size. The American and Classic were strong competitors in the former two segments, so for the 1965 model year, he set his sights on turning the Ambassador into a proper full-size car by stretching the Classic's wheelbase and giving it much different styling. The general sizes of automobiles at that time were based on industry standard wheelbase lengths, rather than on the vehicle's interior and cargo space. The 1965 Ambassador represented a fundamental shift in corporate ideology, a shift away from primarily fuel-efficient vehicles, to bigger, faster, and potentially more profitable cars.<ref name=\"gunn65-66\">{{cite web |last=Gunn |first=Malcolm |title=Fine Lines: 1965\u20131966 AMC Ambassador |publisher=auto123 |url= http://www.auto123.com/en/car-reviews/used/fine-lines-1965-1966-amc-ambassador?model=AMBASSADOR&artid=66071&pg=1 |date=23 July 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Ambassador rode the same platform as its 1963\u201364 forebears, the 1965 models looked all-new.

At the front, the Ambassador again sparked minor controversy with its new vertically stacked quad headlights, which were slightly recessed in their bezels, as they flanked an all-new horizontal bar grille. This new wall-to-wall grille projected forward, horizontally, in the center, to create an effect somewhat opposite to 1963's grille treatment. The front end design provided a bold, rugged appearance.<ref name=\"Vance65-66\"/>\n\nOnce again, the Ambassador\u2019s entire extra wheelbase was ahead of the cowl, meaning that interior volume was the same as the intermediate-sized Classic. Another new body style debuted in the Ambassador lineup for 1965: an attractive new convertible offered as part of the 990 series. This was the first time a [[convertible (car)|convertible]] was offered in the Ambassador line since 1948. All Ambassador body styles (except the 990-H coupe) offered seating for six passengers, with coupes and convertibles having the option of buckets seats with center console and floor shifter.

[[Chevrolet|Bel Air]] and [[Chevrolet Impala|Impala]], Ford Custom 500 and [[Ford Galaxie|Galaxie]], as well as [[Plymouth Fury]]) came with six-cylinder engines as standard equipment. They therefore appealed to a wider range of customers than the Ambassador was getting.

The effect was repeated in the new vertical wraparound taillamps with the top-line models receiving a twin set of horizontal ribbed moldings across the back of the trunk lid that simulated the look of the front grille. Hardtop coupes received a redesigned roofline that was angular in appearance with an angle cut rear side windows and rectangular rear window. The backlight no longer curved and wrapped slightly around the C-pillars. The changes made for a more \"formal\" [[notchback]] look that was popular at the time.\n\nStation wagons also received a new roof (that did not have as pronounced dip over the rear cargo area) as well as a redesigned tailgate and optional [[Woodie (car body style)#Simulated woodgrain|simulated woodgrain]] exterior side panels.

Abernethy was again responsible for this marketing move, as he attempted to move the stylish new Ambassador even further upmarket. To him, that meant that the Rambler name, and its economy car image would be eschewed to give the car a clean slate in a market that was turning away from economy and toward V8 performance.

The grille itself was blackout with a chrome horizontal bar that connected the headlight clusters. The hood was redesigned to accommodate the grille's raised center portion, and it faintly recalled [[Packard|Packard's]] classic grille/hood combination. [[Richard A. Teague]], AMC's Vice President of Styling, had worked at the luxury car manufacturer before joining AMC. Parking lights were rectangular and mounted horizontally in recessed wells in the front bumper, just beneath each set of headlights. The entire front fascia leaned forward slightly to lend an air of forward motion to the car's appearance.\n\nAt the rear, ribbed rectangular taillights were mounted inboard the Ambassadors rearward-thrusting rear fenders. Square ribbed marker lights of similar height were mounted at the trailing edge of each fender side. The deck lid had a slightly higher lift over. The base and DPL models had no decorative panel connecting the taillights while the top-line SST versions featured a panel painted red to match the taillights. Station wagons saw vertical wraparound taillights replacing the previous \"hooded\" units, which were not visible from the side. The 1969 AMC Ambassador was a smooth, powerful, well-proportioned sedan that did not look like anything else on the road.<ref>{{cite web |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=1967, 1968, 1969 AMC Ambassador Specifications \u2013 page 2 |publisher=howstuffworks.com |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1967-1969-amc-ambassador2.htm |date=26 November 2007 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe interiors were upgraded and a new deeply hooded dashboard clustered instruments and controls in front of the driver. There was an increased emphasis on luxury-type trim and features. The base model two-door hardtop was dropped for 1969.\n\nThe 1969 Ambassador stressed luxury, with the marketing tagline developed by [[Mary Wells Lawrence]] at the Wells Rich Greene agency, tying the car's value, \"It will remind you of the days when money really bought something.\"<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CyBFAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA102&dq=1969+Ambassador+It+will+remind+you+of+the+days+when+money+really+bought+something |page=102 |title=American Motors Corporation: The Rise and Fall of America's Last Independent |first=Patrick R. |last=Foster |publisher=Motorbooks |year=2013 |isbn=9780760344255 |accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref> The combination of rich velour upholstery, individually adjustable reclining seats, standard air conditioning, and the longer wheelbase were highlighted in advertisements with Ambassador's posh\"[[limousine]]\" ride at an economical price. One aspect of this new advertising theme included many AMC dealers inviting prospective customers to call and request a \"demonstration ride\", in which a uniformed chauffeur would arrive at the prospect's home and drive them around in an Ambassador SST sedan. AMC's efforts worked, and Ambassador sales shot up again.\n\n[[File:1969 AMC Ambassador limousine in Wisconsin sideR.JPG|thumb|left|1969 Ambassador Royale Stretch Limo by Armbruster/Stageway.

The conversions were unusual in that they did not keep the stock rear doors\u2014as is typical in most limos. The back doors were welded shut and the Ambassadors were lengthened by inserting a section just behind the original [[Pillar (car)|B-pillar]] that had an entirely new central door in this center making a large opening for entry and egress. {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on|spell=In}} steel \"I-beams\" bridge the expanse created by stretch.

On hardtop coupes, this restyling resulted in a sloping roofline that saw upswept reverse-angle quarter windows. The belt line kicked up at the point the hardtop's rear windows swept upward, and tapered back to the fender end, meeting a new loop-type rear bumper.\n\nOn sedans, the roof line showed a slimmer C-pillar, squared-off rear door windows, and met a belt line that kicked up beneath the trailing edge of each rear door window. The belt line tapered back to the same rear fascia as the hardtop coupe's. This rear fascia contained a new ribbed taillight lens that stretched wall-to-wall and included twin square white reverse light lenses in its center.\n\nStation wagons received no change to their rooflines, doors, and rear fascias. However, all Ambassadors received a new extruded aluminum grille at the front, featuring several widely spaced bright horizontal bars with one wide, body colored horizontal grille bar extending to each headlight cluster. The {{convert|290|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 was replaced for 1970 by a new {{convert|304|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine. This {{convert|210|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 4400 rpm and {{convert|305|lb.ft|N\u00b7m|0}} of torque at 2800 rpm was the standard engine on all DPL and SST models. The {{convert|343|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 was also supplanted by a {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engine available in either 2-barrel, regular gasoline, or high-output, 4-barrel, premium fuel versions. The 4-barrel \"AMX\" {{convert|390|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine was optional, producing {{convert|325|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 3200 rpm and {{convert|420|lb.ft|N\u00b7m|0}} of torque at 3200 rpm.\n\n=== 1971 ===\n[[File:1971 AMC Ambassador 2-door hardtop coupe.JPG|thumb|left|1971 Ambassador hardtop with TurboCast II wheels from 1979\u201383]]\n[[File:1971 AMC Ambassador station wagon red with woodgrain side panels.JPG|thumb|left|1971 Ambassador station wagon]]\n\nFollowing the previous year's redesign, the 1971 Ambassadors received only minor changes and improvements. The marketing tag line for the year was the [[Underdog (competition)|underdog]] asking, \"If you had to compete with GM, Ford and Chrysler, what would you do?\"\u2014that was answered by AMC including more features, advantages, and benefits for buyers of its cars compared to the models from its much larger competitors. This was reflected by shuffling the Ambassador models for 1971 and by including more equipment in the standard feature list. The previously nameless base models were dropped, as the sedan-only DPL trim line was relegated to base model status, and a new top-line '''Brougham''' trim line was added above mid-line SST models. Both SST and Brougham models came as hardtop coupes, sedans, and wagons.\n\nThe DPL came with AMC's new {{convert|258|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} {{convert|150|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} Inline-6 with seven main bearings. All the SSTs and Broughams featured the {{convert|304|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine with {{convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} as standard. BorgWarner's \"Shift-Command\" automatic transmissions were standard equipment across the line. Two of AMC's {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} were optional; an 8.5:1 compression version with a two-barrel carburetor or a high-compression four-barrel V8 that required premium-fuel. The previous \"AMX 390\" V8 gave way to a new {{convert|401|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} {{convert|335|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} V8 as the top engine option.\n\nStyling changes consisted of a new fascia up front. It featured headlights contained in their own chrome pods separate from, but flanking the new grille with a bright rectangular surround, with rounded edges. The \"natural\" cast [[pot metal]] grille insert was recessed and featured a bright vertical bar pattern. A second set of parking lights was added outboard of the headlight clusters, and they were integrated into the fender extension to eliminate the need for separate front marker lights.\n\nTaillights on hardtop coupes and sedans still ran wall-to-wall, but the twin backup lights were moved from the center to further outboard\u2014approximately eight inches in from either fender side. Once again, the wagon received few changes at the rear, but added a new design for its optional woodgrain side trim, which filled in its upper bodysides. Its lower edge flowed downward aft of its peak at the leading edge above each front wheelhouse, in similar fashion to the [[Buick Skylark]]'s side \"sweepspear\" styling cue.\n\nAmbassador base models were offered to fleet buyers with various police, [[taxicab]], and other heavy-duty packages. Governments and police departments in the U.S. historically used standard-size, low-price line four-door sedans.

This backing also included mechanical upgrades to increase durability and quality, such as the standardization of electric windshield wipers on all model lines, replacing AMC's vacuum-powered units, as well as better interior trims. By focusing on quality, the smallest domestic automaker was profitable for 1972, earning US$30.2 million (the highest net profit achieved by AMC since 1964) on $4 billion in sales.\n\nThe base Ambassador DPL model was canceled, with three body styles now available in SST and Brougham trim. Fleet purchasers could order plain Ambassadors in Police Pursuit Vehicle (PPV) or Special Service Package (SSP) versions. A six-cylinder engine was no longer available; thus, Ambassador became a V8-only car for the first time since 1964. This made the Ambassador the only volume-produced American car that included air conditioning, power brakes, automatic transmission, and a V8 engine as standard equipment; all while being priced less than the Big Three's full-sized cars.<ref name=\"1972AMCphotos\">{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/AMC/1972_AMC/1972_Ambassador_Promo/1972%20Ambassador%20Promo-01.html |title=1972 AMC Ambassador press photos |date=1 September 1971 |work=The Old Car Manual Project |accessdate=28 July 2015}}</ref> The base engine was the {{convert|304|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} with two {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} or a {{convert|401|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} versions optional.

The grille gained heavier horizontal bars and headlight bezels took on blackout trim in their recessed portions.\n\n== Eighth generation ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| model_years  = 1974\n| image        = 1974 AMC Ambassador Brougham 4-door sedan beige.JPG\n| caption      = 1974 Ambassador Brougham sedan\n| class        = [[Full-size car|Full-size]]\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list | 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] | 4-door [[station wagon]] }}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|122|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length       = {{convert|217.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine       = {{unbulleted list | {{convert|304|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]] | {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 | {{convert|401|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 }}\n| transmission = 3-speed ''[[Torqueflite|Torque Command]]'' [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| name         = Eighth generation\n}}\n\n=== 1974 ===\n[[File:1974 AMC Ambassador sedan blue-white Kenosha-r.jpg|thumb|left|1974 AMC Ambassador sedan]]\n[[File:1974 AMC Ambassador sedan blue-white Kenosha-a.jpg|thumb|left|1974 AMC Ambassador sedan]]\n\nAmbassador sales had remained steady since 1970, despite the lack of major changes to the vehicle. 1974 models were stretched, {{convert|7|in|mm|spell=in}}, just as the 1973 [[1973 oil crisis|Arab Oil Embargo]] sparked nationwide gasoline rationing to accommodate energy absorbing bumpers.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Norbye |first=Jan P. |title=New bumpers have uniform height, take angle impacts |journal=Popular Science |pages=90\u201391 |date=October 1973 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lpiMSzja6W4C&pg=PA90&lpg=PA90&dq=New+bumpers+have+uniform+Ambassador |volume=203 |issue=4 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe 1974 Ambassador Brougham was no longer available as a 2-door (pillar-less) [[hardtop]], leaving the 4-door sedan and station wagon body styles. The hardtop's cancellation was due in part to low sales volume of the Ambassador 2-door versions, as well as the introduction of the 1974 [[AMC Matador|Matador coupe]] which received the ''[[Car and Driver]]'' \"Best Styled Car of 1974,\" featuring a long hood and short rear deck design that avoided (at least on introduction) period hallmarks such as imitation landau bars and opera lights.<ref>{{cite journal |title=none|journal=Car and Driver |date=November 1973 }}</ref>\n\nStyling changes for the Ambassador sedan and wagon included revised front fender caps on the same fenders used since 1969, and hood, grille, bumpers, rear fascia, instrument panel, interior trim, hood ornament, and a new font for the Ambassador nameplate. The grille showed off a new squared-off loop-type design surrounding the circular recessed quad headlights, and featured a forward-protruding center. The insert held a crosshatch pattern dominated by two thick horizontal bars that connected the headlight bezels and contained new parking lights between them. These parking lights had amber lenses, followed the grille protrusion forward, and were overlaid by the grille's crosshatch trim. Headlamp bezels were once again blacked out in their recessed areas. The new hood and front bumper followed the grille's central protrusion forward, giving the car a slight \"coffin nose\" look. The revised [[AMC Matador|Matador]] sedan saw a similar frontal treatment in 1974, but with a much more pronounced effect and with different single headlamp clusters, hood, and grille insert.\n\nAs with the new Matador sedan, the new rear bumper was much larger and backed by shock absorbers, as it was beefed up to comply with new [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] regulations for standardized front and rear bumpers on passenger cars that could sustain a {{convert|5|mph|0|adj=on}} impact with no damage. Sedan rear fenders received fiberglass caps that wrapped inward to create a recessed space that met a carryover [[decklid]]. In this space was mounted the new rectangular taillight housings, which featured taller white backup lights mounted inboard of the new taillights. The license plate moved from the rear bumper to the area between the new taillight assemblies, and the whole taillight and license plate system on the sedans was surrounded its own loop of chrome trim. Both Ambassador and Matador sedans shared the same rear end styling. \n\nThe cargo area and the rear design of station wagons remained similar to previous Ambassadors, save for a massive new bumper and revised taillamps. The wagon was available with two-row bench seats for six passengers or with a rear-facing third row for a total eight seat-belted passengers. All came with numerous practical, appearance, and comfort items as standard. These included a two-way opening tail gate: (1) hinged at the bottom for convenient loading or hauling long cargo and (2) hinged at the side to open as door for ease of entry and exit for passengers or cargo; wood grained [[Transparency (optics)|semi-transparent]] vinyl side and rear trim, a full-length [[roof rack]]; as well as a chrome and wood grain roof air deflector to help keep the tailgate window clean.\n\nPowertrain selections remained the same as in 1973, with only [[AMC V8 engine|V8 engines]] and automatic transmissions available. When ordered with a trailer package (special wiring harness with heavy-duty flasher and heavy-duty suspension with rear sway bar), the Ambassador was rated for up to {{convert|5000|lb|0|adj=on}} towing capacity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schultz |first=Mort |title=Cars to take your rig in tow |journal=Popular Mechanics |pages=156\u2013157 |date=March 1974 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ddQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA156&dq=1974+AMC+Ambassador |volume=141 |issue=3 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> Other increases for 1974 included a larger capacity fuel tank, {{convert|24.9|usgal|L impgal|0|abbr=on}}, and an alternator producing 62 [[ampere]]s. New sound insulation made the Ambassador even quieter. All came with a very lengthy list of standard equipment that was typically optional on competing makes. These included comfort items such as air conditioning, an AM radio, and vanity mirror to appearance enhancements such as [[pin striping]] and [[whitewall tire]]s.\n\nSales of all full-size vehicles, regardless of the automaker, fell significantly in 1974 as America's focus shifted to smaller cars. Ambassador sales were no different, and in June 1974, the final AMC Ambassador rolled off the [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] assembly line, ending a nameplate that had been in continuous production in some form for 48 years.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==International markets==\n\n===Argentina===\n[[File:AutoantiguodesfileMDP5-9jul2016.jpg|thumb|right|Fifth U.S. generation Ambassador 990 built by IKA from 1965 to 1972]] \n'''Industrias Kaiser Argentina''' [[Industrias Kaiser Argentina|(IKA)]] produced the U.S. third, fourth, and fifth generation Ambassadors in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina]] from 1962 to 1972, and later available by special order through 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cocheargentino.com.ar/r/rambler.htm |title=IKA - Caracter\u00edsticas Classic Custom - Classic Custom De Luxe - Ambassador 440 |date=18 May 2009 |publisher=Coche Argentino |language=Spanish |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nAssembly of IKA Ramblers began in 1962, with the Argentinean cars being the 1961 U.S. versions, but equipped with {{convert|226|cuin|L|2|abbr=on}} [[Continental Motors Company|Continental]] I6 engines producing {{convert|119|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm, along with a steering column mounted manual three-speed transmission.

The Australian-built Ambassadors included a significant percentage of \"local content\" to gain import [[tariff]] (tax) concessions by using parts and components (such as interiors and upholstery) that were sourced from Australian manufacturers. AMI's first year of production resulted in 65 registrations for 1961. Registrations of the 1963 model continued into 1964 for a total of 21 Ambassadors registered for 1964.\n\nAlthough not documented in any AMI records, according to Australian Rambler afficionados 20 right-hand drive 1970 Ambassadors were fully imported from Canada, apparently 16 two-door hardtops and 4 four-door sedans. One possible reason for this was that it may have been a holding action while AMI was preparing for assembly of the new 1970 Rebel. AMC had assembled over 3,700 RHD Rambler Ambassadors for the U.S Postal Service in 1967, so they were well experienced in making completed right-hand drive vehicles. All Australian factory-RHD 1970 Ambassadors came with automatic transmission with floor shift.<ref>https://www.gumtree.com.au/s-ad/benaraby/cars-vans-utes/rambler-ambassador/1242484069</ref>\n\nThe dash and instrument pack of the 1967 Ambassador which had been converted and used in the RHD Ambassadors assembled for the U.S Postal Service was thereafter used in all Australian and New Zealand-assembled Rambler Rebel and Matador models, and all RHD, U.S-built Rebel and Matadors for the United Kingdom.\n\n===New Zealand===\n[[File:1970 AMC Ambassador SST (14379718872).jpg|thumb|right|One of 12 factory-RHD 1970 Ambassadors for the New Zealand market ]]\n\nAmerican Motors motor vehicles were assembled in New Zealand by '''VW Motors''' at their Volkswagen plant in Otahuhu, Auckland from 1958 until 1962.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/motoring/107503496/the-empty-halls-of-new-zealands-car-assembly-industry |title=The empty halls of New Zealand's car assembly industry |first=Todd |last=Niall |website=Stuff |date=6 October 2018 |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref> From 1964, AMC vehicles were assembled by '''Campbell Motor Industries''' (CMI) in Thames, [[North Island]].

The model was virtually restricted to the four-door hardtop sedan only. It was powered by the four-barrel {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine producing {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} coupled to a three-speed automatic transmission. The model became the marque's top-of-the-line product alongside the three versions of the midsize Rambler and Rambler American models. \n\nHowever, low sales figures alongside a deteriorating relationship between AMC and Planta REO lead to the cancellation of the contract in the second half of 1959. <ref>{{cite book|first=Douglas C. |last=Bennett |first2=Kenneth E. |last2=Sharpe |title=Transnational Corporations versus the State: The Political Economy of the Mexican Auto Industry |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=2014 |isbn=9780691022376}}</ref> American Motors once again exported its products into Mexico and a new local partner, Willys Mexicana that eventually would become '''Vehiculos Automotores Mexicanos''' [[Vehiculos Automotores Mexicanos|(VAM)]]. The agreement was signed in March 1960 and production began in Mexico City. \n\nThis meant the discontinuation of the Ambassador line in Mexico as the new operation had several priorities above offering a top-end luxury full-size car line. Aside from offering the already existing Jeep line, Willys Mexicana focused efforts on the compact Rambler American, which obtained a generation change just the next year, meaning a complete retooling of the Vallejo plant. In 1962, legal and industrial requirements in the country became stronger with the auto industry integration decree issued by president [[Adolfo L\u00f3pez Mateos]] in 1962. Among its mandates, it fully banned the importation of automobile engines. Willys Mexicana began building its own engine plant, which was achieved in November 1964. Once the Rambler American was consolidated in the Mexican market, Willys Mexicana opted to expand the product line by introducing the brand-new second generation Rambler Classic midsize model as a larger luxury counterpart to the economy compact American. Also in 1963, due to problems with WM's parent company (the SOMEX bank) as well as further requirements of the government auto industry decree, Willys Mexicana was reorganized into an entirely new company with expanded capital and direct investment from the Mexican government, Kaiser Willys, and American Motors. This resulted in the formation of Veh\u00edculos Automotores Mexicanos S.A. \n\nAfter the corporate transition process between 1960 and 1964 concluded, in which the Rambler marque under VAM surpassed the commercial results of its local predecessors Armadora Mexicana and Planta REO combined between 1950 and 1959, the company opted not to offer the Ambassador model. The Mexican market of the era was still relatively small and since the Ambassador shared mostly the same styling as the contemporary midsize model of the company, it was considered that internal competition would affect the sales of a simultaneous Rambler Classic/Ambassador line-up. Unlike the United States, which had a much larger and diverse market for two different car lines with the same styling, AMC could offer a strong difference between both models with the exclusive V8 engine for the Ambassador and the Classic being restricted to six cylinders only. This advantage did not exist in Mexico since VAM could only produce six cylinder engines in its Lerma plant and V8 engines could not be imported from AMC due to the ban of the 1962 decree. Instead, VAM opted to use the Rambler Classic as its most luxurious and flagship model, giving it the same treatment AMC put in the Ambassador model in the US and Canada. This would be passed on to the subsequent equivalent Rebel and Matador models produced under VAM. \n\nThe 1958\u20131959 Ambassador models represent the only chapter in this model's history to be present in Mexico. These were the only full-size American Motors products sold in the country alongside the second generation VAM Classic (Matador) models. Even more unique was the fact that it was a factory V8 model, the only one of its kind to ever be sold in Mexico belonging to American Motors.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nRambler Ambassadors were exported in limited numbers to the United Kingdom in factory right-hand-drive direct from AMC during the 1960s and up to its final year of 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/File:Im196610MotSC-RamblerMots.jpg |title=Image of Rambler Motors (AMC) Ltd. advertisement |website=www.gracesguide.co.uk |date=1967 |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref> They were imported by '''Rambler Motors (A.M.C) Ltd''' of Chiswick in West London which became a subsidiary of AMC in 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Rambler_Motors |title=Rambler Motors |website=www.gracesguide.co.uk |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref> The location had previously been used since 1926 for British assembly of Hudson, Essex, and Terraplane vehicles<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/april-1968/44/us-car-concessionaires-great-britain|title=U.S. Car Concessionaires in Great Britain |date=April 1968 |website=Motor Sport Magazine (Archive) |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref> and later AMC's post-1954 Hudson, Nash and Rambler models. Ambassador models marketed in the UK were the Ambassador saloon (sedan), SST coupe, and station wagon. AMC vehicles were distributed by London distributors Clarke and Simpson Limited and were marketed as \"the only American car built with RHD.\"<ref>http://www.classiccarcatalogue.com/RAMBLER%201968.html</ref> As with all export markets UK models were marketed as \"Rambler\" even after the Rambler marque was dropped in the USA.\n\n== Epilogue ==\nBecause AMC was focusing its attentions on their newly acquired [[Jeep]] line, the redesigned 1974 Matador coupe, and the [[AMC Pacer]], which would debut in 1975, the company would not put forth the investment to continue the full-size Ambassador line after its 1974 redesign. Instead, the automaker upgraded the Matador sedan and wagon counterparts starting with the 1975 model year. The basic [[automobile platform]] was used by AMC since the 1967 model year, and the full-size automobile market segment was declining. American Motors strategy now aimed at smaller cars and sport-utility vehicles.\n\nHowever, the Ambassador basically continued as the similarly sized and styled [[AMC Matador|Matador]] sedans and wagons. From 1975 they became available in uplevel \"Brougham\" trim and assumed the model numbers of the previously equivalent Ambassadors.<ref>{{cite book |last=Flory, Jr. |first=J. \u201cKelly\u201d

Rambler''', '''Rambler Ambassador''', and finally '''AMC Ambassador.''' Previously, the nameplate [[Nash Ambassador|Ambassador]] applied to [[Nash Motors|Nash's]] full-size cars. The nameplate referred to a trim level between 1927 and 1931.\n\nAmbassadors were manufactured in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] as well as at AMC's [[Brampton Assembly]] in Brampton, Ontario from 1963 to 1966. [[Australian Motor Industries]] (AMI) assembled Ambassadors from [[knock-down kit]]s with [[right-hand drive]] from 1961 to 1963. The U.S. fifth generation Ambassadors were manufactured by [[Industrias Kaiser Argentina]] (IKA) in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina]] from 1965 to 1972, as well as assembled by ECASA in [[Costa Rica]] from 1965 to 1970. Planta REO assembled first-generation Ambassadors in Mexico at its Monterrey, Nuevo Le\u00f3n plant. Fifth and seventh generation Ambassadors were modified into custom stretch [[limousine]]s in Argentina and the U.S.\n\n== Development ==\nFollowing [[George W. Mason]]'s unexpected death in the fall of 1954, [[George W. Romney|George Romney]] (whom Mason had been grooming as his eventual successor), succeeded him as president and CEO of the newly formed American Motors. Romney recognized that to be successful in the postwar marketplace, an automobile manufacturer would have to be able to produce and sell cars in sufficient volume to [[Amortization (business)|amortize]] the high cost of tooling. Toward that end, he set out to increase AMC's market share with its Rambler models that were selling in [[market segment]] in which the domestic Big Three ([[General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company]], and [[Chrysler]]) automakers did not yet compete. While development of a redesigned 1958 Nash Ambassador, based on a stretched and reskinned 1956 Rambler [[Coachwork|body]] was almost complete, AMC's [[Automotive design|designers]] were also working on a retrimmed [[Hudson Motor Car Company|Hudson]] equivalent, called '''Rebel''', to offer Hudson [[Car dealership|dealers]].\n\nHowever, as sales of the large-sized [[Nash Ambassador]] and [[Hudson Hornet]] models slowed, it became clear to Romney that consumer confidence in the historic Nash and Hudson nameplates had collapsed. Reluctantly, he decided that 1957 would be the end of both nameplates, and the company would concentrate on the new Rambler line, which was registered as a separate [[marque]] for 1957.\n\nThe market positioning meant that \"the AMC Ambassador was a car with no real competitors throughout most of the sixties\" because it was viewed as a luxury-type car and could be put against the higher end large-sized models from the domestic Big Three automakers, but the Ambassador was more of a midsized car.<ref>{{cite book |last=Flory, Jr. |first=J. \u201cKelly\u201d |title=American Cars, 1973-1980: Every Model, Year by Year |date=2012 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786456369 |page=2 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1DiNAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2&dq=the+AMC+Ambassador+was+a+car+with+no+real+competitors+throughout+most+of+the+sixtie |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n== First generation ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image        = Rambler Ambassador (3893707660).jpg\n| caption      = 1958 Ambassador V8, Custom sedan\n| model_years  = 1958\u20131959\n| aka          = Ambassador V8 by Rambler\n| name         = First generation\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list | 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] | 4-door [[hardtop]] sedan | 4-door [[station wagon]] | 4-door [[hardtop]] station wagon }}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|117|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| transmission = 3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| engine       = {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]]\n}}\n\n=== 1958 ===\n[[File:1958 Ambassador 4-d hardtop.jpg|thumb|right|1958 Ambassador Custom hardtop sedan with [[continental tire]] ]]\n[[File:1958 Ambassador 4-d hardtop wagon 2.JPG|thumb|right|Ambassador hardtop (pillarless) Cross Country station wagon]]\n\nAmerican Motors planned to produce a stretched a {{convert|117|in|0|adj=on}} [[wheelbase]] version of the Rambler platform for Nash dealers to be the new Nash Ambassador, and another for Hudson dealers. Shortly before committing to production of the new long-wheelbase versions of the Hudson and the Nash, CEO Romney decided to abandon the Nash and Hudson marques.\n\nDespite the fact that the Nash and Hudson names were canceled, work on the car itself continued, and American Motors introduced debuted in the fall of 1957, the 1958 \"Ambassador V-8 by Rambler\" on a {{convert|117|in|0|adj=on}} wheelbase. Its features included a {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]] (equipped with a 4-barrel [[carburetor]] and dual exhausts and rated at {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|360|lb\u00b7ft|N\u00b7m}} of torque) mated to a [[BorgWarner]] supplied 3-speed [[automatic transmission]] with push button gear selection.\n\nIn 1956, AMC first produced its own V8, a modern overhead valve V8 displacing {{convert|250|CID|L|1|abbr=on}}, with a forged steel crank shaft, which when equipped with a 4-barrel carburetor was rated at {{convert|215|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. In 1957, AMC bored and stroked the 250 CID V8 to {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} displacement which when offered in the [[Rambler Rebel]] used solid lifters and Bendix electronic fuel injection was rated at {{convert|288|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn 1958, the Ambassador was equipped with a hydraulic lifter version of AMC's 327 CID V8 rated at {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. Although AMC's 327 CID V8 shares its displacement with the Chevrolet small-block, AMC's 327 came out six years before Chevrolet first offered its 327 in 1962.\n\nThe Ambassador was available in a body style exclusive to its line, a pillarless [[hardtop]] '''Cross Country''' [[station wagon]]. The 1958 Ambassador was offered in a single high level trim level and came equipped with such luxury items as electric clock, twin front and rear ashtrays, Nash tradition \"deep coil\" spring suspension front and rear, split back reclining front seats that fold down into a bed, as well as upscale fabrics for the interior.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---July/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-Brochure/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-24-25 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816085955/http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---July/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-Brochure/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-24-25 |archivedate=August 16, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nManagement had found that the public associated the Rambler name with small economy cars, and did not want the upscale nature of the new Ambassador to be so closely associated with Rambler's favorable, but economical image. Therefore, a decision was made that the larger Ambassador would be marketed as the '''Ambassador V-8 by Rambler''' in order to identify it with the Rambler name's burgeoning success, but to indicate an air of exclusivity by showing it to be a different kind of vehicle. However, the car wore \"Rambler Ambassador\" badges on its front fenders.\n\nThe 1958 Ambassador is a substantially longer car than the {{convert|108|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase [[Rambler Six]] and [[Rambler Rebel|Rebel V8]], although both lines shared the same basic body, styling, and visual cues. However, all of the Ambassador's extra {{convert|9|in|mm|spell=in}} of wheelbase (and, therefore, overall length) were added ahead of the cowl, meaning that the passenger compartment had the same volume as the smaller Ramblers. The Ambassadors came with plusher interior and exterior trims while the front end incorporated the Rebel \"V-Line\" grille from the prototype Hudson model. Through effective [[market segment]]ation, the Ambassador was [[Positioning (marketing)|positioned]] to compete with the larger models offered by other automakers.\n\nModel identification was located on the car's front fenders and deck lid. '''Super''' trim level Ambassadors featured painted side trim in a color that complemented the body color; '''Custom''' models featured a silver [[anodized aluminum]] panel on sedans and vinyl woodgrain decals on station wagons. Ambassador body styles included a four-door sedan and a [[hardtop]] sedan, a four-door pillared station wagon, and the aforementioned hardtop station wagon, a body style that first saw duty as an industry first in the 1956 [[Nash Rambler|Nash and Hudson Rambler]] line, on which all of the 1958 Ramblers were based.\n\nThe Ambassador had an excellent power-to-weight ratio for its time and provided spirited performance with [[0 to 60 mph]] (0 to 97&nbsp;km/h) times of less than 10-seconds, and low 17-second times through a quarter-mile (402&nbsp;m) [[dragstrip]]. It could be equipped with a [[limited slip differential]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---July/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-Brochure/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-20-21 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816065829/http://oldcarbrochures.org/New-Brochures---July/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-Brochure/1958-X-Ray-Ambassador-20-21 |archivedate=August 16, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> as well as power brakes, power steering, power windows, and [[air conditioning]].

[[Scotchlite]] reflectors were also added to the rear of the tailfins to increase visibility at night. Front and rear bumpers were over 20% thicker, and featured recessed center sections to protect [[license plates]]. Adjustable headrests were now available as an option for the front seats, an industry first. [[American Motors Corporation|AMC]] touted the added comfort the headrests provided, as well as their potential for reducing [[whiplash (medicine)|whiplash]] injuries in the event of a rear-end collision. Other changes included the activation of the starter through the neutral pushbutton (on automatic transmission equipped cars), and the addition of an optional \"Powr-Saver\" engine fan, which featured a [[Fan clutch|fluid-filled clutch]] for quieter high-speed operation.\n\nThe 1959 model year also saw the addition of an optional \"Air-Coil Ride\" [[air suspension]] system, utilizing air bags installed within the rear coil springs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/AMC/1959_AMC/1959_Rambler_Wagons/1959-Rambler-Wagons-05 |title=1959 Rambler Wagons brochure |publisher=oldcarbrochures.org |accessdate=23 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522175749/http://oldcarbrochures.org/NA/AMC/1959_AMC/1959_Rambler_Wagons/1959-Rambler-Wagons-05 |archivedate=May 22, 2014 |df=mdy }}</ref> An engine-driven [[Gas compressor|compressor]], reservoir, and ride-height control valve comprised the rest of the system, but as other automakers discovered, the troublesome nature of air-suspension outweighed its benefits. [[American Motors Corporation|AMC]] discontinued the unpopular option at the end of the model year.\n\nAmbassador sales improved considerably over 1958, reaching an output of 23,769; nearly half of which were '''Custom''' four-door sedans. Much rarer was the hardtop station wagon, of which only 578 were built.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Second generation ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image        = 1960 AMC Rambler Ambassador sedan green NJ.jpg\n| caption      = 1960 Ambassador V8 by Rambler\n| model_years  = 1960\u20131961\n| aka          = Rambler Ambassador\n| name         = Second generation\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list | 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] | 4-door [[hardtop]] sedan | 4-door [[station wagon]] | 4-door [[hardtop]] station wagon }}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|117|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine       = {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]]\n}}\n\n=== 1960 ===\n1960 saw the Ambassador lineup totally reskinned, wearing new fenders, hood, deck lid, door skins, roofline, grille, taillights, bumpers, windshield, and backlight. Significant were the lower hood line, lower windshield cowl, simplified side trim, egg crate grill, while the tailfins were reduced in height and were canted to either side making for a modern and integrated appearance. The overall effect was rather fresh, as the new roof had a lower, lighter look, to complement the lower fins and grille.\n\nAll Ambassadors came equipped with the American Motors {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]], but for the first time it was available in two versions. First was the original {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|360|lb\u00b7ft|N\u00b7m|abbr=on}} of torque, performance version equipped with the 4-barrel carburetor and a 9.7:1 compression ratio, which required premium fuel, and a second economy version running on regular gasoline making {{convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|340|lb\u00b7ft|N\u00b7m|abbr=on}} of torque, equipped with a 2-barrel carburetor and an 8.7:1 compression ratio.\n\nAmbassadors now came with a unique compound curved windshield that cut into the roof. This improved visibility, did away with the \u201cknee knocker\u201d dogleg design of AMC's first generation wrap-around windshield, and resulted in an even stiffer unitized structure. The 1960 Ambassador had a low cowl which with the compound windshield afforded excellent visibility. The Ambassador was offered in higher end Custom or entry level Super trim levels. All 1960 Ambassadors came with a new instrument cluster under a padded cowl, as well as illuminated controls for lights, wipers, fan, and defrost functions. The 1960 Ambassadors continued with an enclosed drive shaft (torque tube) and coil springs at all four corners, although the suspension was revised resulting in better handling. The top-of-the-line Ambassador models came standard with individual \"airliner\" reclining front seats that now had even more luxurious fabrics than in previous years.\n\nThe Ambassador was the only American midsize, luxury high-performance car offered in 1960. The 1960 Ambassador came in 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]], 4-door pillarless hardtop, 4-door [[station wagon]], and a 4-door pillarless ([[hardtop]]) station wagon. Equipped with the 270&nbsp;horsepower 327&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in V8, and the Borg Warner pushbutton-operated 3-speed planetary gear and torque converter automatic transmission, the Ambassadors reached {{convert|60|mph|km/h|0}} in just over 9 seconds and passed the quarter-mile in 17 seconds.\n\n=== 1961 ===\n[[File:1961 Rambler Ambassador Custom blue-fl.jpg|thumb|left|1961 Rambler Ambassador Custom]]\n[[File:1961 AMC Rambler Ambassador 4-door pink rear.JPG|thumb|right|1961 Rambler Ambassador sedan]]\n\nThe 1961 Ambassador continued the previous year's {{convert|117|in|mm|0|adj=on}} basic [[Unit body|unitized platform]], but received an unusual new front-end styling that was overseen by AMC's in-house design department headed by [[Edmund E. Anderson|Edmund Anderson]]. The new face consisted of a trapezoid grille and headlights that floated in a body-colored panel, while the front fenders arched downward and forward of the leading edge of the hood. Different from anything else on the market, AMC's marketing department promoted the look as \"European.\" While the new look was meant to distinguish the Ambassador from the lower-priced Ramblers, it was neither a consumer success nor well received in the automotive press. Overall sales fell as the entire industry was experiencing a [[recession]]. The hardtop sedan and wagon models did not return for 1961.\n\nStandard was the {{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 with a [[Manual transmission#Synchronized transmission|synchromesh manual transmission]].

And while Rambler sales had been good enough for third place in industry sales (behind [[Chevrolet]] and [[Ford]]), AMC's management was working on a revolutionary and somewhat costly design set to debut for the 1963 model year. In the meantime, American Motors needed to save money, and since the Ambassador's sales had fallen in 1961, it was decided that the car would be downsized for 1962 to share its body, windshield and {{convert|108|in|0|adj=on}} wheelbase with its [[Rambler Classic|Classic]] line mate. Accordingly, the car was marketed as a '''Rambler Ambassador'''.\n\nThe 1962 Ambassador received a new front end that was very similar to the 1961\u201362 Classic's, but with a crosshatch design, recessed center section, and '''Ambassador''' lettering. New, rectangular taillights were seen at the ends of restyled rear fenders, which lost their fins entirely. Exterior trim was reshuffled, and a new 2-door pillared sedan debuted. A new '400' trim line was added at the top of the line, with Super and Custom models remaining. The Ambassador offered even more luxurious interiors, perhaps to make up for the fact that it now shared its wheelbase with the Rambler Classic. The 400 could be had with vinyl [[bucket seat]]s, headrests, and color coordinated shag carpets.\n\nThe only available engine was AMC's {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} OHV V8, in either the regular fuel, 2-barrel carburetor and 8.7:1 compression ratio, {{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} version or the premium gasoline, 4-barrel version with 9.7:1 compression ratio, {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} version. The 1962 Ambassador came with a dual chamber [[master brake cylinder]] that separated the front and rear brakes so that in the event of the failure of one chamber some braking function would remain. This design was offered by only a few cars at that time. The 1962 models were equipped with \"Walker\" (brand) flow-through mufflers. The {{convert|108|in|0|adj=on}} wheelbase 1962 Ambassador was lighter than its {{convert|117|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase predecessors and when equipped with the {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, it was a spirited performer.\n\nThe 1962, {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 Ambassador for the first time used the same {{convert|108|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase structure as did the 1957 Rambler Rebel which was also equipped with an earlier solid lifter version of the AMC 327. The 1957 Rambler Rebel equipped with a 3-speed column mounted manual transmission, was the quickest 4-door sedan made in the United States, achieving {{convert|0|to|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} [[acceleration]] in just over 7 seconds, making it faster than the Hemi [[Chrysler 300 letter series|Chrysler 300C]], the [[DeSoto Adventurer]], the Dodge D500, the Plymouth Fury, and the Chevrolet fuel-injected 283.<ref>{{cite web|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide''|title=1957-1960 Rambler Rebel |publisher=howstuffworks.com |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1957-1960-rambler-rebel1.htm |date=22 August 2007 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> The 1962 Ambassador was available with a 3-speed manual transmission and being basically the same vehicle, should also reach 60&nbsp;mph about as quickly as did the 1957 Rambler Rebel.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Fourth generation ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| model_years  = 1963\u20131964\n| image        = File:1963 Rambler Ambassador 880 sedan gold-white K-f.jpg\n| caption      = 1963 Rambler Ambassador 880 Sedan\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list | 2-door [[coupe]] (1963) | 4-door sedan | 4-door [[station wagon]] | 2-door [[hardtop]] (1964) }}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|112|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length       = {{convert|188.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width        = {{convert|71.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height       = {{convert|55.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine       = {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]]\n| name         = Fourth generation\n}}\n\n=== 1963 ===\n[[File:1963 Rambler Ambassador 990 Sedan.jpg|thumb|left|1963 Rambler Ambassador 990 Sedan]]\nIn 1962 Romney left AMC to run for [[Governor of Michigan|Governor]] of [[Michigan]], a position that he won.

This resulted in an extremely rigid and rattle-free structure, better fit of doors into frames, production cost savings and reduced noise, vibration and harshness. The \"uniside\" structure was superior to the conventional production methods in which multiple smaller pieces were welded together.<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://amcrc.com/aug05feature.html |last=Isbrandt |first=Ralph H. |title=Rambler Engineering |journal=Motor Trend |date=February 1963 |publisher=AMCRC |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> There were 30% fewer parts and the result was greater structural rigidity, quieter car operation, and an overall weight reduction of about {{convert|150|lb|kg|0|abbr=off}}.<ref name=\"automotive-fleet-63\"/>\n\nCurved side glass and [[push-button]] door handles were new and costly upgrades, but contributed to the new Rambler's handsome, elegant, and modern Mercedes-like bodyside styling, by adding greater elegance in detail. At the time, curved side glass was used only in much more expensive luxury cars, but increased interior room and visibility, as well as reducing wind noise and improved proportions and styling of the cars.<ref name=\"DrivingGeorgeRomney\"/> The Ambassador also featured a squared-off [[Ford Thunderbird|Thunderbird]]-type roofline.<ref name=\"automotive-fleet-63\"/> The front end featured a forward-thrusting upper and lower ends with a vertical bar \"electric shaver\" chrome grille insert. The Ambassador's grille was differentiated from the Classic's grille by its use of the Ambassador name in script in the small horizontal bar between the upper and lower grille sections. Round quad headlights were slightly recessed in chrome bezels mounted side-by-side within the grille at its outermost edges. Overall, the new Ambassadors were described by the staff of ''Automotive Fleet'' magazine as \"probably the finest looking cars ever produced by American Motors.\"<ref name=\"automotive-fleet-63\"/>\n\nAmbassadors once again came in 2-door [[coupe]], 4-door sedan, and 4-door wagon body styles, but new trim lines debuted. A \"Mercedes-like three-number model designation was developed\" with the '''800''' as the Ambassador's base line (replacing the previous year's Super model) for the police, taxi, and fleet market, a '''880''' model (in place of the Custom), and the up level '''990''' trim (replacing the previous 400 models).<ref name=\"howstuffworks1963-1964_1\"/>\n\nThe 1963 Ambassadors were offered only with the {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8, in either {{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 2-barrel or {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 4-barrel versions. AMC's smaller {{convert|287|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine was only offered in the Classic line. The automatic transmission was controlled by a steering column mounted lever, replacing the previous pushbutton system. Maintenance was reduced with service intervals of the front wheel bearings increased from {{convert|12000|-|25000|mi|km|0|abbr=off}}, the recommended engine oil change was at {{convert|4000|mi|km|0|abbr=off}}, and all Ambassador models included an [[Alternator (automotive)|alternator]] and an [[Voltage regulator|electronic voltage regulator]] as standard equipment.<ref name=\"automotive-fleet-63\"/>\n\nSales were brisk, and the redesign was billed a success, with ''[[Motor Trend]]'' Magazine bestowing '''[[Motor Trend Car of the Year|Car of the Year]]''' status on the entire 1963 Rambler line, including the Ambassador. The marketing formula for the Ambassador generated record sales for the model with buyers favoring more luxury and features as evidenced by the Ambassador 990 models outselling the 880 versions by nearly 2-to-1, while the base 800 model had a total of only 43 two-door sedans built.<ref name=\"howstuffworks1963-1964_1\"/> The automaker did not have the resources of GM, Ford, and Chrysler, nor the sales volume to spread out its new model tooling and advertising costs over large production volumes; however, Richard Teague \"turned these economical cars into smooth, streamlined beauties with tons of options and V-8 pep.\"<ref name=\"howstuffworks1963-1964\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=1963-1964 AMC/Rambler Ambassador & Classic Specifications |date=21 November 2007 |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1963-1964-amc-rambler-ambassador-classic2.htm |accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== 1964 ===\nThe 1964 model year introduced minor trim changes and new options. The \"electric-shaver\" grille on the 1963 model was replaced with a flush-mounted design, and the engine and transmission options were widened. A two-door [[hardtop]] body style called '''990-H''' was added for the first time since 1957. Base 880 and the 880 models were dropped from the line.\n\nThe 1964 Ambassadors featured the {{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} 2-barrel {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 as standard, with the 4-barrel {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} version as optional. The automaker did not offer a 4-speed manual transmission to compete with the sporty mid-size V8 offerings from Ford or GM. Instead, AMC offered its innovative \u201cTwin-Stick\u201d manual transmission. The \"Twin stick\" option consisted a three-speed manual transmission, operated by one of the two console mounted \"sticks\" in conjunction with an overdrive unit that was controlled by the second \"stick\" in both 2nd and 3rd gears. This gave the driver the option of using five forward gears. One magazine noted the Twin-Stick, {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} Ambassador was heading for a sub 16-second quarter-mile when they blew up the clutch.\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:1964 Ambassador 2-d white f.jpg|1964 Rambler Ambassador\nFile:1964 Ambassador 2-d white r.jpg|1964 Rambler Ambassador\nFile:1964 Ambassador 2-d white i.jpg|1964 Rambler Ambassador interior with \"Twin-Stick\" transmission\n</gallery>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Fifth generation ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| model_years  = 1965\u20131966\n| image        = 1965 AMC Ambassador black 2door-HT in NJ.JPG\n| caption      = 1965 Rambler Ambassador 990 2-door hardtop\n| aka          = Rambler Ambassador<br/>AMC Ambassador\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list | 2-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] | 4-door sedan | 4-door [[station wagon]] | 2-door [[hardtop]] | 2-door [[convertible]] }}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|116|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length       = {{convert|200|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine       = {{unbulleted list | {{convert|232|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC Straight-6 engine|I6]] | {{convert|287|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]] | {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 }}\n| name         = Fifth generation\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list | 3-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] | 3-speed with [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] | \"Twin-Stick\" on console (1965) | 4-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] (1966) | 3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] | 3-speed \u201cShift-Command\u201d on console }}\n}}\n\n=== 1965 ===\n\nNo matter how much success the new Ramblers achieved in the marketplace, Roy Abernethy was not completely satisfied. Using the experience he gained as an outstanding salesman as a guide, Abernethy closely looked at the direction that American Motors' competition was going and decided that the company would be much more successful if its products competed more directly with the Big Three. He would achieve this by pushing all AMC vehicles further upmarket among the various [[market segment]]s, shaking off the company's economy car image, and offering vehicles once again in all three major American car size classes: compact, intermediate, and full-size. The American and Classic were strong competitors in the former two segments, so for the 1965 model year, he set his sights on turning the Ambassador into a proper full-size car by stretching the Classic's wheelbase and giving it much different styling. The general sizes of automobiles at that time were based on industry standard wheelbase lengths, rather than on the vehicle's interior and cargo space. The 1965 Ambassador represented a fundamental shift in corporate ideology, a shift away from primarily fuel-efficient vehicles, to bigger, faster, and potentially more profitable cars.<ref name=\"gunn65-66\">{{cite web |last=Gunn |first=Malcolm |title=Fine Lines: 1965\u20131966 AMC Ambassador |publisher=auto123 |url= http://www.auto123.com/en/car-reviews/used/fine-lines-1965-1966-amc-ambassador?model=AMBASSADOR&artid=66071&pg=1 |date=23 July 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Ambassador rode the same platform as its 1963\u201364 forebears, the 1965 models looked all-new.

At the front, the Ambassador again sparked minor controversy with its new vertically stacked quad headlights, which were slightly recessed in their bezels, as they flanked an all-new horizontal bar grille. This new wall-to-wall grille projected forward, horizontally, in the center, to create an effect somewhat opposite to 1963's grille treatment. The front end design provided a bold, rugged appearance.<ref name=\"Vance65-66\"/>\n\nOnce again, the Ambassador\u2019s entire extra wheelbase was ahead of the cowl, meaning that interior volume was the same as the intermediate-sized Classic. Another new body style debuted in the Ambassador lineup for 1965: an attractive new convertible offered as part of the 990 series. This was the first time a [[convertible (car)|convertible]] was offered in the Ambassador line since 1948. All Ambassador body styles (except the 990-H coupe) offered seating for six passengers, with coupes and convertibles having the option of buckets seats with center console and floor shifter. The Ambassador 990-H was an up-scale two-door hardtop model, available only in 5-passenger form.\n[[File:1965 Ambassador 990 convertible yellow pb-rr.jpg|thumb|left|1965 Ambassador 990 convertible]]\nAmbassadors also saw an expanded list of trim lines, convenience options, and engine choices. The 990 and 990-H models were back, while 880 models were the new economy leaders in the 1965 Ambassador line, but even the $2,512 price for the two-door sedan was not attractive compared to the models with better trim, buckets seats, and special interiors.<ref>{{cite web |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=1965\u20131966 Rambler Ambassador: Creating the early Rambler Ambassador |publisher=howstuffworks.com |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1965-1966-rambler-ambassador1.htm |date=23 October 2007 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> Ambassadors came standard with AMC's new {{convert|232|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC Straight-6 engine|Inline-6 engine]], which was the first time since 1956 that an Ambassador was available with six cylinders.

[[Chevrolet|Bel Air]] and [[Chevrolet Impala|Impala]], Ford Custom 500 and [[Ford Galaxie|Galaxie]], as well as [[Plymouth Fury]]) came with six-cylinder engines as standard equipment. They therefore appealed to a wider range of customers than the Ambassador was getting. Also, since the Classic was now smaller and styled differently, the Ambassador [[Straight-6|six-cylinder]] would not threaten to cannibalize Classic 6 sales, which were the company's sales volume leaders. The changes were on target as sales of the repositioned Ambassador more than tripled.\n\n''Motor Trend'' magazine tested an Ambassador convertible with a Twin-Stick overdrive transmission and found it commendably economical, averaging {{convert|16.4|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} over {{convert|1000|mi}} run, and noting that ... \"Traveling comfort was the Ambassador's biggest selling point, along with its exceptionally powerful [[Bendix Corporation|Bendix]] duo-servo drum brakes ...With the thin bucket seats that recline, driver and passengers can enjoy a high degree of riding comfort...

The V-shaped horizontal louver spanned unbroken between the headlamps and the effect was continued with twin rectangular trim pieces attached to the side of the front fenders at their leading edges by the headlamps. The effect was repeated in the new vertical wraparound taillamps with the top-line models receiving a twin set of horizontal ribbed moldings across the back of the trunk lid that simulated the look of the front grille. Hardtop coupes received a redesigned roofline that was angular in appearance with an angle cut rear side windows and rectangular rear window. The backlight no longer curved and wrapped slightly around the C-pillars. The changes made for a more \"formal\" [[notchback]] look that was popular at the time.\n\nStation wagons also received a new roof (that did not have as pronounced dip over the rear cargo area) as well as a redesigned tailgate and optional [[Woodie (car body style)#Simulated woodgrain|simulated woodgrain]] exterior side panels. Available with two-rows of seats with a standard bottom hinged tailgate with electric, fully retracting rear window or with an optional rear-facing third row that featured a left side hinged rear door, with a regular exterior door handle on the right side.

Abernethy was again responsible for this marketing move, as he attempted to move the stylish new Ambassador even further upmarket. To him, that meant that the Rambler name, and its economy car image would be eschewed to give the car a clean slate in a market that was turning away from economy and toward V8 performance. The evidence suggests that Abernethy was on the right track with moving the Ambassador upscale to compete with other manufacturers' luxury models as sales of the AMC's flagship jumped from 18,647 in 1964 to over 64,000 in 1965, and then in 1966 they went to more than 71,000.<ref name=\"Vance65-66\"/> Although the Ambassador accounted for a mere fraction of total passenger car sales in the U.S., it was an important step in bringing the AMC's products in line with what the consumer of the day wanted.<ref name=\"gunn65-66\"/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Sixth generation ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| model_years  = 1967\u20131968\n| image        = 1967 Ambassador DPL conv top-up-winter-WV.jpg\n| caption      = 1967 AMC Ambassador DPL convertible\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list | 2-door [[sedan (automobile)]] (1967 only) | 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] | 4-door [[station wagon]] | 2-door [[hardtop]] [[coup\u00e9|coupe]] | 2-door [[convertible]] (1967 only) }}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|118|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length       = {{convert|202.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine       = {{unbulleted list | {{convert|232|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC Straight-6 engine|I6]] | {{convert|290|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8]] | {{convert|343|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 | {{convert|390|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 }}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list | 3-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] | 3-speed with [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] | 4-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] | 3-speed [[BorgWarner]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] | 3-speed \u201cShift-Command\u201d on center floor console }}\n| name         = Sixth generation\n}}\n\n=== 1967 ===\nAmerican Motors introduced a completely restyled longer, lower, and wider Ambassador for the 1967 model year, now riding on a {{convert|118|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase, or {{convert|2|in|mm|spell=in}} longer than before.

The grille itself was blackout with a chrome horizontal bar that connected the headlight clusters. The hood was redesigned to accommodate the grille's raised center portion, and it faintly recalled [[Packard|Packard's]] classic grille/hood combination. [[Richard A. Teague]], AMC's Vice President of Styling, had worked at the luxury car manufacturer before joining AMC. Parking lights were rectangular and mounted horizontally in recessed wells in the front bumper, just beneath each set of headlights. The entire front fascia leaned forward slightly to lend an air of forward motion to the car's appearance.\n\nAt the rear, ribbed rectangular taillights were mounted inboard the Ambassadors rearward-thrusting rear fenders. Square ribbed marker lights of similar height were mounted at the trailing edge of each fender side. The deck lid had a slightly higher lift over. The base and DPL models had no decorative panel connecting the taillights while the top-line SST versions featured a panel painted red to match the taillights. Station wagons saw vertical wraparound taillights replacing the previous \"hooded\" units, which were not visible from the side. The 1969 AMC Ambassador was a smooth, powerful, well-proportioned sedan that did not look like anything else on the road.<ref>{{cite web |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |title=1967, 1968, 1969 AMC Ambassador Specifications \u2013 page 2 |publisher=howstuffworks.com |url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1967-1969-amc-ambassador2.htm |date=26 November 2007 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe interiors were upgraded and a new deeply hooded dashboard clustered instruments and controls in front of the driver.

On hardtop coupes, this restyling resulted in a sloping roofline that saw upswept reverse-angle quarter windows. The belt line kicked up at the point the hardtop's rear windows swept upward, and tapered back to the fender end, meeting a new loop-type rear bumper.\n\nOn sedans, the roof line showed a slimmer C-pillar, squared-off rear door windows, and met a belt line that kicked up beneath the trailing edge of each rear door window. The belt line tapered back to the same rear fascia as the hardtop coupe's. This rear fascia contained a new ribbed taillight lens that stretched wall-to-wall and included twin square white reverse light lenses in its center.\n\nStation wagons received no change to their rooflines, doors, and rear fascias. However, all Ambassadors received a new extruded aluminum grille at the front, featuring several widely spaced bright horizontal bars with one wide, body colored horizontal grille bar extending to each headlight cluster. The {{convert|290|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 was replaced for 1970 by a new {{convert|304|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine. This {{convert|210|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 4400 rpm and {{convert|305|lb.ft|N\u00b7m|0}} of torque at 2800 rpm was the standard engine on all DPL and SST models. The {{convert|343|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 was also supplanted by a {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engine available in either 2-barrel, regular gasoline, or high-output, 4-barrel, premium fuel versions. The 4-barrel \"AMX\" {{convert|390|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine was optional, producing {{convert|325|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 3200 rpm and {{convert|420|lb.ft|N\u00b7m|0}} of torque at 3200 rpm.\n\n=== 1971 ===\n[[File:1971 AMC Ambassador 2-door hardtop coupe.JPG|thumb|left|1971 Ambassador hardtop with TurboCast II wheels from 1979\u201383]]\n[[File:1971 AMC Ambassador station wagon red with woodgrain side panels.JPG|thumb|left|1971 Ambassador station wagon]]\n\nFollowing the previous year's redesign, the 1971 Ambassadors received only minor changes and improvements. The marketing tag line for the year was the [[Underdog (competition)|underdog]] asking, \"If you had to compete with GM, Ford and Chrysler, what would you do?\"\u2014that was answered by AMC including more features, advantages, and benefits for buyers of its cars compared to the models from its much larger competitors. This was reflected by shuffling the Ambassador models for 1971 and by including more equipment in the standard feature list. The previously nameless base models were dropped, as the sedan-only DPL trim line was relegated to base model status, and a new top-line '''Brougham''' trim line was added above mid-line SST models. Both SST and Brougham models came as hardtop coupes, sedans, and wagons.\n\nThe DPL came with AMC's new {{convert|258|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} {{convert|150|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} Inline-6 with seven main bearings. All the SSTs and Broughams featured the {{convert|304|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine with {{convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} as standard. BorgWarner's \"Shift-Command\" automatic transmissions were standard equipment across the line. Two of AMC's {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} were optional; an 8.5:1 compression version with a two-barrel carburetor or a high-compression four-barrel V8 that required premium-fuel. The previous \"AMX 390\" V8 gave way to a new {{convert|401|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} {{convert|335|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} V8 as the top engine option.\n\nStyling changes consisted of a new fascia up front. It featured headlights contained in their own chrome pods separate from, but flanking the new grille with a bright rectangular surround, with rounded edges. The \"natural\" cast [[pot metal]] grille insert was recessed and featured a bright vertical bar pattern. A second set of parking lights was added outboard of the headlight clusters, and they were integrated into the fender extension to eliminate the need for separate front marker lights.\n\nTaillights on hardtop coupes and sedans still ran wall-to-wall, but the twin backup lights were moved from the center to further outboard\u2014approximately eight inches in from either fender side. Once again, the wagon received few changes at the rear, but added a new design for its optional woodgrain side trim, which filled in its upper bodysides. Its lower edge flowed downward aft of its peak at the leading edge above each front wheelhouse, in similar fashion to the [[Buick Skylark]]'s side \"sweepspear\" styling cue.\n\nAmbassador base models were offered to fleet buyers with various police, [[taxicab]], and other heavy-duty packages. Governments and police departments in the U.S. historically used standard-size, low-price line four-door sedans.

This backing also included mechanical upgrades to increase durability and quality, such as the standardization of electric windshield wipers on all model lines, replacing AMC's vacuum-powered units, as well as better interior trims. By focusing on quality, the smallest domestic automaker was profitable for 1972, earning US$30.2 million (the highest net profit achieved by AMC since 1964) on $4 billion in sales.\n\nThe base Ambassador DPL model was canceled, with three body styles now available in SST and Brougham trim. Fleet purchasers could order plain Ambassadors in Police Pursuit Vehicle (PPV) or Special Service Package (SSP) versions. A six-cylinder engine was no longer available; thus, Ambassador became a V8-only car for the first time since 1964.

The hardtop's cancellation was due in part to low sales volume of the Ambassador 2-door versions, as well as the introduction of the 1974 [[AMC Matador|Matador coupe]] which received the ''[[Car and Driver]]'' \"Best Styled Car of 1974,\" featuring a long hood and short rear deck design that avoided (at least on introduction) period hallmarks such as imitation landau bars and opera lights.<ref>{{cite journal |title=none|journal=Car and Driver |date=November 1973 }}</ref>\n\nStyling changes for the Ambassador sedan and wagon included revised front fender caps on the same fenders used since 1969, and hood, grille, bumpers, rear fascia, instrument panel, interior trim, hood ornament, and a new font for the Ambassador nameplate. The grille showed off a new squared-off loop-type design surrounding the circular recessed quad headlights, and featured a forward-protruding center. The insert held a crosshatch pattern dominated by two thick horizontal bars that connected the headlight bezels and contained new parking lights between them. These parking lights had amber lenses, followed the grille protrusion forward, and were overlaid by the grille's crosshatch trim. Headlamp bezels were once again blacked out in their recessed areas. The new hood and front bumper followed the grille's central protrusion forward, giving the car a slight \"coffin nose\" look. The revised [[AMC Matador|Matador]] sedan saw a similar frontal treatment in 1974, but with a much more pronounced effect and with different single headlamp clusters, hood, and grille insert.\n\nAs with the new Matador sedan, the new rear bumper was much larger and backed by shock absorbers, as it was beefed up to comply with new [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] regulations for standardized front and rear bumpers on passenger cars that could sustain a {{convert|5|mph|0|adj=on}} impact with no damage. Sedan rear fenders received fiberglass caps that wrapped inward to create a recessed space that met a carryover [[decklid]]. In this space was mounted the new rectangular taillight housings, which featured taller white backup lights mounted inboard of the new taillights. The license plate moved from the rear bumper to the area between the new taillight assemblies, and the whole taillight and license plate system on the sedans was surrounded its own loop of chrome trim. Both Ambassador and Matador sedans shared the same rear end styling. \n\nThe cargo area and the rear design of station wagons remained similar to previous Ambassadors, save for a massive new bumper and revised taillamps. The wagon was available with two-row bench seats for six passengers or with a rear-facing third row for a total eight seat-belted passengers. All came with numerous practical, appearance, and comfort items as standard. These included a two-way opening tail gate: (1) hinged at the bottom for convenient loading or hauling long cargo and (2) hinged at the side to open as door for ease of entry and exit for passengers or cargo; wood grained [[Transparency (optics)|semi-transparent]] vinyl side and rear trim, a full-length [[roof rack]]; as well as a chrome and wood grain roof air deflector to help keep the tailgate window clean.\n\nPowertrain selections remained the same as in 1973, with only [[AMC V8 engine|V8 engines]] and automatic transmissions available. When ordered with a trailer package (special wiring harness with heavy-duty flasher and heavy-duty suspension with rear sway bar), the Ambassador was rated for up to {{convert|5000|lb|0|adj=on}} towing capacity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schultz |first=Mort |title=Cars to take your rig in tow |journal=Popular Mechanics |pages=156\u2013157 |date=March 1974 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ddQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA156&dq=1974+AMC+Ambassador |volume=141 |issue=3 |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> Other increases for 1974 included a larger capacity fuel tank, {{convert|24.9|usgal|L impgal|0|abbr=on}}, and an alternator producing 62 [[ampere]]s. New sound insulation made the Ambassador even quieter. All came with a very lengthy list of standard equipment that was typically optional on competing makes. These included comfort items such as air conditioning, an AM radio, and vanity mirror to appearance enhancements such as [[pin striping]] and [[whitewall tire]]s.\n\nSales of all full-size vehicles, regardless of the automaker, fell significantly in 1974 as America's focus shifted to smaller cars. Ambassador sales were no different, and in June 1974, the final AMC Ambassador rolled off the [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] assembly line, ending a nameplate that had been in continuous production in some form for 48 years.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==International markets==\n\n===Argentina===\n[[File:AutoantiguodesfileMDP5-9jul2016.jpg|thumb|right|Fifth U.S. generation Ambassador 990 built by IKA from 1965 to 1972]] \n'''Industrias Kaiser Argentina''' [[Industrias Kaiser Argentina|(IKA)]] produced the U.S. third, fourth, and fifth generation Ambassadors in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina]] from 1962 to 1972, and later available by special order through 1975.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cocheargentino.com.ar/r/rambler.htm |title=IKA - Caracter\u00edsticas Classic Custom - Classic Custom De Luxe - Ambassador 440 |date=18 May 2009 |publisher=Coche Argentino |language=Spanish |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nAssembly of IKA Ramblers began in 1962, with the Argentinean cars being the 1961 U.S. versions, but equipped with {{convert|226|cuin|L|2|abbr=on}} [[Continental Motors Company|Continental]] I6 engines producing {{convert|119|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm, along with a steering column mounted manual three-speed transmission.

The Australian-built Ambassadors included a significant percentage of \"local content\" to gain import [[tariff]] (tax) concessions by using parts and components (such as interiors and upholstery) that were sourced from Australian manufacturers. AMI's first year of production resulted in 65 registrations for 1961. Registrations of the 1963 model continued into 1964 for a total of 21 Ambassadors registered for 1964.\n\nAlthough not documented in any AMI records, according to Australian Rambler afficionados 20 right-hand drive 1970 Ambassadors were fully imported from Canada, apparently 16 two-door hardtops and 4 four-door sedans. One possible reason for this was that it may have been a holding action while AMI was preparing for assembly of the new 1970 Rebel. AMC had assembled over 3,700 RHD Rambler Ambassadors for the U.S Postal Service in 1967, so they were well experienced in making completed right-hand drive vehicles. All Australian factory-RHD 1970 Ambassadors came with automatic transmission with floor shift.<ref>https://www.gumtree.com.au/s-ad/benaraby/cars-vans-utes/rambler-ambassador/1242484069</ref>\n\nThe dash and instrument pack of the 1967 Ambassador which had been converted and used in the RHD Ambassadors assembled for the U.S Postal Service was thereafter used in all Australian and New Zealand-assembled Rambler Rebel and Matador models, and all RHD, U.S-built Rebel and Matadors for the United Kingdom.\n\n===New Zealand===\n[[File:1970 AMC Ambassador SST (14379718872).jpg|thumb|right|One of 12 factory-RHD 1970 Ambassadors for the New Zealand market ]]\n\nAmerican Motors motor vehicles were assembled in New Zealand by '''VW Motors''' at their Volkswagen plant in Otahuhu, Auckland from 1958 until 1962.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.stuff.co.nz/motoring/107503496/the-empty-halls-of-new-zealands-car-assembly-industry |title=The empty halls of New Zealand's car assembly industry |first=Todd |last=Niall |website=Stuff |date=6 October 2018 |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref> From 1964, AMC vehicles were assembled by '''Campbell Motor Industries''' (CMI) in Thames, [[North Island]].

The model was virtually restricted to the four-door hardtop sedan only. It was powered by the four-barrel {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine producing {{convert|270|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} coupled to a three-speed automatic transmission. The model became the marque's top-of-the-line product alongside the three versions of the midsize Rambler and Rambler American models. \n\nHowever, low sales figures alongside a deteriorating relationship between AMC and Planta REO lead to the cancellation of the contract in the second half of 1959. <ref>{{cite book|first=Douglas C. |last=Bennett |first2=Kenneth E. |last2=Sharpe |title=Transnational Corporations versus the State: The Political Economy of the Mexican Auto Industry |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=2014 |isbn=9780691022376}}</ref> American Motors once again exported its products into Mexico and a new local partner, Willys Mexicana that eventually would become '''Vehiculos Automotores Mexicanos''' [[Vehiculos Automotores Mexicanos|(VAM)]]. The agreement was signed in March 1960 and production began in Mexico City. \n\nThis meant the discontinuation of the Ambassador line in Mexico as the new operation had several priorities above offering a top-end luxury full-size car line. Aside from offering the already existing Jeep line, Willys Mexicana focused efforts on the compact Rambler American, which obtained a generation change just the next year, meaning a complete retooling of the Vallejo plant. In 1962, legal and industrial requirements in the country became stronger with the auto industry integration decree issued by president [[Adolfo L\u00f3pez Mateos]] in 1962. Among its mandates, it fully banned the importation of automobile engines. Willys Mexicana began building its own engine plant, which was achieved in November 1964. Once the Rambler American was consolidated in the Mexican market, Willys Mexicana opted to expand the product line by introducing the brand-new second generation Rambler Classic midsize model as a larger luxury counterpart to the economy compact American. Also in 1963, due to problems with WM's parent company (the SOMEX bank) as well as further requirements of the government auto industry decree, Willys Mexicana was reorganized into an entirely new company with expanded capital and direct investment from the Mexican government, Kaiser Willys, and American Motors. This resulted in the formation of Veh\u00edculos Automotores Mexicanos S.A. \n\nAfter the corporate transition process between 1960 and 1964 concluded, in which the Rambler marque under VAM surpassed the commercial results of its local predecessors Armadora Mexicana and Planta REO combined between 1950 and 1959, the company opted not to offer the Ambassador model. The Mexican market of the era was still relatively small and since the Ambassador shared mostly the same styling as the contemporary midsize model of the company, it was considered that internal competition would affect the sales of a simultaneous Rambler Classic/Ambassador line-up. Unlike the United States, which had a much larger and diverse market for two different car lines with the same styling, AMC could offer a strong difference between both models with the exclusive V8 engine for the Ambassador and the Classic being restricted to six cylinders only. This advantage did not exist in Mexico since VAM could only produce six cylinder engines in its Lerma plant and V8 engines could not be imported from AMC due to the ban of the 1962 decree. Instead, VAM opted to use the Rambler Classic as its most luxurious and flagship model, giving it the same treatment AMC put in the Ambassador model in the US and Canada. This would be passed on to the subsequent equivalent Rebel and Matador models produced under VAM. \n\nThe 1958\u20131959 Ambassador models represent the only chapter in this model's history to be present in Mexico. These were the only full-size American Motors products sold in the country alongside the second generation VAM Classic (Matador) models. Even more unique was the fact that it was a factory V8 model, the only one of its kind to ever be sold in Mexico belonging to American Motors.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nRambler Ambassadors were exported in limited numbers to the United Kingdom in factory right-hand-drive direct from AMC during the 1960s and up to its final year of 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/File:Im196610MotSC-RamblerMots.jpg |title=Image of Rambler Motors (AMC) Ltd. advertisement |website=www.gracesguide.co.uk |date=1967 |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref> They were imported by '''Rambler Motors (A.M.C) Ltd''' of Chiswick in West London which became a subsidiary of AMC in 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Rambler_Motors |title=Rambler Motors |website=www.gracesguide.co.uk |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref> The location had previously been used since 1926 for British assembly of Hudson, Essex, and Terraplane vehicles<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/april-1968/44/us-car-concessionaires-great-britain|title=U.S. Car Concessionaires in Great Britain |date=April 1968 |website=Motor Sport Magazine (Archive) |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref> and later AMC's post-1954 Hudson, Nash and Rambler models.

AMC vehicles were distributed by London distributors Clarke and Simpson Limited and were marketed as \"the only American car built with RHD.\"<ref>http://www.classiccarcatalogue.com/RAMBLER%201968.html</ref> As with all export markets UK models were marketed as \"Rambler\" even after the Rambler marque was dropped in the USA.\n\n== Epilogue ==\nBecause AMC was focusing its attentions on their newly acquired [[Jeep]] line, the redesigned 1974 Matador coupe, and the [[AMC Pacer]], which would debut in 1975, the company would not put forth the investment to continue the full-size Ambassador line after its 1974 redesign. Instead, the automaker upgraded the Matador sedan and wagon counterparts starting with the 1975 model year. The basic [[automobile platform]] was used by AMC since the 1967 model year, and the full-size automobile market segment was declining. American Motors strategy now aimed at smaller cars and sport-utility vehicles.\n\nHowever, the Ambassador basically continued as the similarly sized and styled [[AMC Matador|Matador]] sedans and wagons. From 1975 they became available in uplevel \"Brougham\" trim and assumed the model numbers of the previously equivalent Ambassadors.<ref>{{cite book |last=Flory, Jr. |first=J. \u201cKelly\u201d |title=American Cars, 1973-1980: Every Model, Year by Year |date=2012 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=9780786456369 |page=223 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yPwcDJ10TtAC&pg=PA223&dq=AMC+discontinued+the+Ambassador+line |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref> The Matador was also offered in a unique top-of-the-line '''Barcelona''' four-door in its final year of production, 1978.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lamm |first1=Michael |title=Driving the '78 cars from American Motors |journal=Popular Mechanics |date=October 1977 |volume=148 |issue=4 |page=106, 178 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6uEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA106&dq=Matador+Barcelona+sedan |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=1978 AMC Full Line Brochure |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.org/United%20States/AMC/1978_AMC/1978_AMC_Brochure/slides/1978_AMC-28.html |website=Old Car Brochures Project |pages=28\u201329, 32 |accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Foster |first=Patrick R. |title=AMC Cars: 1954\u20131987 An Illustrated History |publisher=Motorbooks |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-58388-112-5 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Foster |first=Patrick R. |title=AMC Performance Cars: 1951\u20131983 Photo Archive |publisher=Motorbooks |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-58388-127-9 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Foster |first=Patrick R. |title=American Motors \u2013 The Last Independent |publisher=Krause Publications |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-87341-240-7}}\n* {{cite journal |last=Foster |first=Patrick R. |title=1958\u20131962 Ambassador: A Rambler By Any Other Name |journal=Collectible Automobile |date=December 1992 |volume=9 |issue=6 }}\n* {{cite book |editor-last=Gunnell |editor-first=John |title=The Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946\u20131975 |publisher=Krause Publications |year=1987 | isbn=978-0-87341-096-0 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=Larry G. |title=Illustrated AMC Buyer's Guide |publisher=Motorbooks |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-87938-891-1 }}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|AMC Ambassador}}\n* [http://www.AMCRC.com/ AMC Rambler Club]\n* [http://www.amonational.com/ American Motors Owners Association]\n* [http://www.nashcarclub.org/ Nash Car Club]\n* [http://www.americansportscars.com/healey.html Nash Healey History]\n* [http://www.nash-gb.com/ Nash in the UK]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101106220820/http://homepage.mac.com/christopher.z/hobby/67-Amb-1.html 1967 Ambassador information]\n* {{imcdb vehicle|make=Rambler|model=Ambassador|Rambler Ambassador}}\n* {{imcdb vehicle|make=AMC|model=Ambassador|AMC Ambassador}}\n\n{{American Motors}}\n{{amc Timeline}}\n\n[[Category:AMC vehicles|Ambassador]]\n[[Category:Sedans]]\n[[Category:Convertibles]]\n[[Category:Coup\u00e9s]]\n[[Category:Station wagons]]\n[[Category:Mid-size cars]]\n[[Category:Full-size vehicles]]\n[[Category:Limousines]]\n[[Category:Police vehicles]]\n[[Category:Taxicab vehicles]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:1960s cars]]\n[[Category:1970s cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1958]]\n", "name_user": "842U", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_Ambassador"}
{"title_page": "Consumer ethnocentrism", "text_new": "{{underlinked|date=October 2013}}\n'''Consumer ethnocentrism''' is derived from the more general [[psychology|psychological]] concept of [[ethnocentrism]]. Basically, ethnocentric individuals tend to view their group as superior to others. As such, they view other groups from the perspective of their own, and reject those that are different and accept those that are similar (Netemeyer et al., 1991; Shimp & Sharma, 1987). This, in turn, derives from earlier sociological theories of in-groups and out-groups (Shimp & Sharma, 1987). Ethnocentrism, it is consistently found, is normal for an in-group to an out-group (Jones, 1997; Ryan & Bogart, 1997).\n\nConsumer ethnocentrism specifically refers to ethnocentric views held by [[consumer]]s in one country, the in-group, towards products from another country, the out-group (Shimp & Sharma, 1987). Consumers may believe that it is not appropriate, and possibly even immoral, to buy products from other countries.\n\nPurchasing foreign products may be viewed as improper because it costs domestic jobs and hurts the economy. The purchase of foreign products may even be seen as simply unpatriotic (Klein, 2002; Netemeyer et al., 1991; Sharma, Shimp, & Shin, 1995; Shimp & Sharma, 1987).\n\n==Attributes==\nConsumer ethnocentrism gives individuals an understanding of what purchases are acceptable to the in-group, as well as feelings of [[Identity (social science)|identity]] and [[Belongingness|belonging]]. For consumers who are not ethnocentric, or [[polycentric consumers]], products are evaluated on their merits exclusive of their [[country of origin]], or possibly even viewed more positively because they are foreign (Shimp & Sharma, 1987; Vida & Dmitrovic, 2001).\n\nBrodowsky (1998) studied consumer ethnocentrism among car buyers in the U.S. and found a strong positive relationship between high ethnocentrism and country-based bias in the evaluation of [[automobile]]s. Consumers with low ethnocentrism appeared to evaluate automobiles based more on the merits of the actual automobile rather than its country of origin. Brodowsky suggests that understanding consumer ethnocentrism is critical in understanding country of origin effects.\n\nSeveral antecedents of consumer ethnocentrism have been identified by various studies. Consumers who tend to be less ethnocentric are those who are young, those who are male, those who are better educated, and those with higher income levels (Balabanis et al., 2001; Good & Huddleston, 1995; Sharma et al., 1995).\n\nBalabanis et al. found that the determinants of consumer ethnocentrism may vary from country to country and culture to culture. In Turkey, [[patriotism]] was found to be the most important motive for consumer ethnocentrism (Acikdilli et al., 2017). This, it was theorized, was due to Turkey's collectivist culture, with patriotism being an important expression of loyalty to the group. In the more individualistic Czech Republic, feelings of [[nationalism]] based on a sense of superiority and dominance appeared to provide the most important contribution to consumer ethnocentrism.\n\n==The CETSCALE==\nShimp and Sharma (1987) developed consumer ethnocentrism into a measurable construct through the use of the consumer ethnocentric tendencies scale (CETSCALE). The initial development of the CETSCALE began with 225 different questions, which were narrowed down to 100 before being sent to a [[Statistical survey|survey]] group for the first [[purification study]]. Through repeated purification studies, the number of questions was finally reduced to 17. Repeated studies by Shimp and Sharma validated the CETSCALE in the U.S.\n\nWhile the 17-item CETSCALE is the original version developed by Shimp and Sharma (1987), shortened versions have been used. One, with 10 items, was developed alongside the full version.\n\nThis is probably the most frequently used version of the CETSCALE, as a result of its relatively few number of questions (Balabanis et al., 2001; Klein, 2002; Klein et al., 1998; Neese & Hult, 2002; Netemeyer et al., 1991; Vida & Dmitrovic, 2001). Other versions have been used with success, including a version used by Klein (2002) with just four items that was found to have a .96 [[correlation]] with the 10-item version.\n\nThe first major test of the validity of the CETSCALE in countries other than the U.S. was carried out in 1991 (Netemeyer et al., 1991; Wang, 1996). Netemeyer et al. surveyed students in the U.S., France, Japan, and West Germany and compared the results.\n\nBoth the 17-item version and the 10-item version were tested. It was found that both versions of the CETSCALE were reliable across the different cultures where it was tested. The results also helped validate the CETSCALE as a measure of consumer ethnocentricity. Since that time, the CETSCALE has been used in many studies in many different countries and cultures.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ethnic nepotism]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* {{cite journal|last1=Acikdilli |first1=Gaye |last2=Ziemnowicz |first2=Christopher |last3=Bahhouth|first3=Victor |title=Consumer Ethnocentrism in Turkey: Ours are Better than Theirs |journal=Journal of International Consumer Marketing |volume=30 |date=2 November 2017 |doi=10.1080/08961530.2017.1361882|issn=0896-1530 |pages=45\u201357}}\n* {{cite journal|last1=Balabanis|first1=George|last2=Diamantopoulos|first2=Adamantios|last3=Mueller|first3=Rene Dentiste|last4=Melewar|first4=T.
