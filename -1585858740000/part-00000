The two species are not genetically compatible: After more than 27 attempts in Russia to hybridise the two species, the result was one stillborn kit that was bred from the pairing of a male North American beaver and a female Eurasian beaver. The difference in chromosome count makes interspecific breeding unlikely in areas where the two species' ranges overlap.<ref name=\"andy\" />\n==== Fur ====\nThe guard hairs of the Eurasian beaver have longer hollow medullae at their tips. There is also a difference in the frequency of fur colours: 66% of Eurasian beavers overall have beige or pale brown fur, 20% have reddish brown, nearly 8% are brown, and only 4% have blackish coats; among North American beavers, 50% have pale brown fur, 25% are reddish brown, 20% are brown, and 6% are blackish.<ref name=\"andy\" />\n==== Head ====\nThe Eurasian beaver has a larger, less rounded head; a longer, narrower muzzle. The Eurasian beaver also has longer nasal bones, with the widest point being at the end of the snout; in the case of the North American beaver, the widest point is at the middle of the snout. The Eurasian beaver has a triangular nasal opening, unlike those of the North American beavers, which are square. Furthermore, the [[foramen magnum]] is rounded in the Eurasian beaver, but triangular in the North American beaver.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n==== Body ====\nThe Eurasian beaver has a narrower, less oval-shaped tail; and shorter shin bones, making it less capable of bipedal locomotion than the North American species. The [[anal gland]]s of the Eurasian beaver are larger, and thin-walled, with a large internal volume, relative to that of the North American beaver.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Castor fiber'' was the [[scientific name]] used by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758, who described the beaver in his work ''[[Systema Naturae]]''.<ref name=\"Linn1758\">{{cite book |last=Linnaeus|first= C. |year=1758 |title=Caroli Linn\u00e6i Systema natur\u00e6 per regna tria natur\u00e6, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis |volume=Tomus I |edition=decima, reformata |location=Holmiae |publisher=Laurentius Salvius |pages=58\u201359 |chapter=''Castor fiber'' |chapterurl=https://archive.org/stream/mobot31753000798865#page/58/mode/2up}} {{in lang|la}}</ref> Between 1792 and 1997, several Eurasian beaver [[zoological specimen]]s were described and proposed as [[subspecies]], including:<ref name=msw3>{{MSW3 Wozencraft |id=12600005 |heading=Species ''Castor fiber''}}</ref>\n*''C. f. albus'' and ''C. f. solitarius'' by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kerr |first1=R. |title=The Animal Kingdom or zoological system of the celebrated Sir Charles Linnaeus.

The two species are not genetically compatible: After more than 27 attempts in Russia to hybridise the two species, the result was one stillborn kit that was bred from the pairing of a male North American beaver and a female Eurasian beaver. The difference in chromosome count makes interspecific breeding unlikely in areas where the two species' ranges overlap.<ref name=\"andy\" />\n==== Fur ====\nThe guard hairs of the Eurasian beaver have longer hollow medullae at their tips. There is also a difference in the frequency of fur colours: 66% of Eurasian beavers overall have beige or pale brown fur, 20% have reddish brown, nearly 8% are brown, and only 4% have blackish coats; among North American beavers, 50% have pale brown fur, 25% are reddish brown, 20% are brown, and 6% are blackish.<ref name=\"andy\" />\n==== Head ====\nThe Eurasian beaver has a larger, less rounded head; a longer, narrower muzzle. The Eurasian beaver also has longer nasal bones, with the widest point being at the end of the snout; in the case of the North American beaver, the widest point is at the middle of the snout. The Eurasian beaver has a triangular nasal opening, unlike those of the North American beavers, which are square. Furthermore, the [[foramen magnum]] is rounded in the Eurasian beaver, but triangular in the North American beaver.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n==== Body ====\nThe Eurasian beaver has a narrower, less oval-shaped tail; and shorter shin bones, making it less capable of bipedal locomotion than the North American species.

Mature females are {{convert|2.6-4.5|m|ftin|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} long, and males {{convert|3\u20136|m|ftin|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}. They have a distinct boss at the end of the snout, which resembles an earthenware pot known as a ''[[ghara]]'', hence the name \"gharial\". The gharial is well adapted to catching fish because of its long, thin snout and 110 sharp, interlocking teeth.\n\nThe gharial probably evolved in the northern [[Indian subcontinent]]. Fossil gharial remains were excavated in [[Pliocene]] deposits in the [[Sivalik Hills]] and the [[Narmada River]] valley. It currently inhabits rivers in the plains of the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. It is the most thoroughly aquatic crocodilian, and leaves the water only for basking and building nests on moist sandbanks. Adults mate at the end of the cold season. Females congregate in spring to dig nests. They lay 20\u201395 eggs, and guard the nests and the young that hatch before the onset of the [[monsoon]]. The hatchlings stay and forage in shallow water during their first year, but move to sites with deeper water as they grow.\n\nThe wild gharial population has declined drastically since the 1930s, and is limited to only 2% of its historical range today. Conservation programmes initiated in India and Nepal focused on reintroducing captive-bred gharials since the early 1980s. Loss of habitat because of [[sand mining]] and conversion to agriculture, depletion of fish resources and detrimental fishing methods continue to threaten the population. It has been listed as [[critically endangered]] on the [[IUCN Red List]] since 2007.\n\nThe oldest known depictions of the gharial are about 4,000 years old and were found in the [[Indus Valley]]. [[Hindus]] regard it as the vehicle of the river deity [[Ganga in Hinduism|Ga\u1e45g\u0101]]. Local people living near rivers attributed mystical and healing powers to the gharial, and used some of its body parts as ingredients of [[indigenous medicine]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Lacerta gangetica'' was the [[scientific name]] proposed by [[Johann Friedrich Gmelin]] in 1789.<ref>{{cite book |author=Gmelin, J.

Gharials were killed by fishermen, hunted for skins, trophies and [[indigenous medicine]], and their eggs collected for consumption. Today, the remaining individuals form several fragmented subpopulations. Hunting is no longer considered a significant threat. However, the wild population declined from an estimated 436 adult gharials in 1997 to fewer than 250 mature individuals in 2006. One reason for this decline is the increased use of [[gill net]]s for fishing in gharial habitat. The other major reason is the loss of riverine habitat as dams, [[barrage (dam)|barrage]]s, irrigation canals and artificial [[wikt:embankment|embankment]]s were built; [[siltation]] and [[sand-mining]] changed river courses; and land near rivers is used for agriculture and grazing by livestock.<ref name=iucn/>\n\nWhen 111 dead gharials were found in the Chambal River between December 2007 and March 2008, it was initially suspected that they had died either because of toxicants or the illegal use of fish nets, in which they became entrapped in and subsequently drowned.<ref name=Nawab_al2013/> Later [[post mortem]] [[Pathology|pathological]] testing of tissue samples revealed high levels of [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s such as [[lead]] and [[cadmium]], which, together with stomach [[ulcer]]s and [[protozoa]]n [[parasite]]s reported in most [[necropsies]], were thought to have caused their deaths.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Whitaker, R. |author2=Basu, D. |author3=Huchzermeyer, F. |last-author-amp=yes |year=2008 |title=Update on gharial mass mortality in National Chambal Sanctuary |journal=Crocodile Specialist Group Newsletter |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=4\u20138 |url=http://www.iucncsg.org/365_docs/attachments/protarea/CSG%20-8d303c03.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\nThe gharial is listed on [[CITES Appendix I]].<ref name=iucn/> In India, it is protected under the [[Wildlife Protection Act of 1972]].<ref name=Whitaker07/> In Nepal, it is fully protected under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1973.<ref name=\"maskey94\"/>\n\n=== Reintroduction programmes ===\n[[File:Gharial Crocodiles - Conservation Breeding Center - Kasara - Chitwan National Park - Nepal - 01 (13907486606).jpg|thumb|Gharials in the Gharial Conservation and Breeding Center at [[Chitwan National Park]]]]\nSince the late 1970s, the gharial conservation approach was focused on [[reintroduction]].

Mature females are {{convert|2.6-4.5|m|ftin|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} long, and males {{convert|3\u20136|m|ftin|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}. They have a distinct boss at the end of the snout, which resembles an earthenware pot known as a ''[[ghara]]'', hence the name \"gharial\". The gharial is well adapted to catching fish because of its long, thin snout and 110 sharp, interlocking teeth.\n\nThe gharial probably evolved in the northern [[Indian subcontinent]]. Fossil gharial remains were excavated in [[Pliocene]] deposits in the [[Sivalik Hills]] and the [[Narmada River]] valley. It currently inhabits rivers in the plains of the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. It is the most thoroughly aquatic crocodilian, and leaves the water only for basking and building nests on moist sandbanks. Adults mate at the end of the cold season. Females congregate in spring to dig nests. They lay 20\u201395 eggs, and guard the nests and the young that hatch before the onset of the [[monsoon]]. The hatchlings stay and forage in shallow water during their first year, but move to sites with deeper water as they grow.\n\nThe wild gharial population has declined drastically since the 1930s, and is limited to only 2% of its historical range today. Conservation programmes initiated in India and Nepal focused on reintroducing captive-bred gharials since the early 1980s. Loss of habitat because of [[sand mining]] and conversion to agriculture, depletion of fish resources and detrimental fishing methods continue to threaten the population. It has been listed as [[critically endangered]] on the [[IUCN Red List]] since 2007.\n\nThe oldest known depictions of the gharial are about 4,000 years old and were found in the [[Indus Valley]].

It does not chew its prey, but swallows it whole. Juvenile gharials were observed to jerk their heads back to manoeuvre fish into their gullets, sliding them in head first. Young gharials feed on [[insects]], [[tadpole]]s, small fish and [[frog]]s. Adults also feed on small [[crustacean]]s.

However, the wild population declined from an estimated 436 adult gharials in 1997 to fewer than 250 mature individuals in 2006. One reason for this decline is the increased use of [[gill net]]s for fishing in gharial habitat. The other major reason is the loss of riverine habitat as dams, [[barrage (dam)|barrage]]s, irrigation canals and artificial [[wikt:embankment|embankment]]s were built; [[siltation]] and [[sand-mining]] changed river courses; and land near rivers is used for agriculture and grazing by livestock.<ref name=iucn/>\n\nWhen 111 dead gharials were found in the Chambal River between December 2007 and March 2008, it was initially suspected that they had died either because of toxicants or the illegal use of fish nets, in which they became entrapped in and subsequently drowned.<ref name=Nawab_al2013/> Later [[post mortem]] [[Pathology|pathological]] testing of tissue samples revealed high levels of [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s such as [[lead]] and [[cadmium]], which, together with stomach [[ulcer]]s and [[protozoa]]n [[parasite]]s reported in most [[necropsies]], were thought to have caused their deaths.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Whitaker, R. |author2=Basu, D. |author3=Huchzermeyer, F. |last-author-amp=yes |year=2008 |title=Update on gharial mass mortality in National Chambal Sanctuary |journal=Crocodile Specialist Group Newsletter |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=4\u20138 |url=http://www.iucncsg.org/365_docs/attachments/protarea/CSG%20-8d303c03.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\nThe gharial is listed on [[CITES Appendix I]].<ref name=iucn/> In India, it is protected under the [[Wildlife Protection Act of 1972]].<ref name=Whitaker07/> In Nepal, it is fully protected under the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1973.<ref name=\"maskey94\"/>\n\n=== Reintroduction programmes ===\n[[File:Gharial Crocodiles - Conservation Breeding Center - Kasara - Chitwan National Park - Nepal - 01 (13907486606).jpg|thumb|Gharials in the Gharial Conservation and Breeding Center at [[Chitwan National Park]]]]\nSince the late 1970s, the gharial conservation approach was focused on [[reintroduction]].

Accesses 2011-02-17</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nBilly Kirkland ([[Bobby Coleman]]), is a 10-year-old boy with cancer who is convinced that he has only weeks to live. He has two misfit best friends, Lucas Lamb ([[Christian Martyn]]) and Howard Garvey ([[Bobb'e J. Thompson]]) who he attends school with. Wanting to be remembered, Billy and his friends try to pursue fame but face a series of schemes which stand in their way, including their neighborhood bullies.\n\nBilly and his friends decide to try to create the most snowmen built in the world in one day. Their first attempt fails miserably because they don't have enough people. They begin a campaign to get more people to help by hanging out flyers and placing posters up around their school, in which Billy gives a speech in the cafeteria, which brings attention. They eventually appeal to the Mayor too, which brings their Principal on board and go to the news channel to get it broadcast. Both the Mayor and the news channel agree to meet them on the day on the event.\n\nThe first part of the day goes well, and they build a lot of snowmen, but they begin to melt by the time the Mayor gets there with the news channel. Billy gets him to agree to delay the final count to give them more time to solve the problem, with Billy giving a small broadcast. But when they get back, their bully Jason Bound had knocked over loads of the snowmen, and corner Billy and his friends. The rest of the school then defends Billy in a snow fight. The day ends when Jason knocks Lucas over and hurts him. Billy's father, Reggie Kirkland arrives, having seen Billy on television, and tells the Mayor and everyone Billy is not dying like he thought he was. The event is canceled, upsetting Billy and his friends.\n\nWhen their spirits get uplifted by the caretaker, the friends talk in a nearby park. Jason soon finds them and begins to push them around. When they push back, the chunk of ice Billy was standing on breaks and falls in the water. The chunk of ice then fills the gap again, trapping Billy under the ice. Howard goes to get help, while Lucas tries to free Billy. Realising he went too far, Jason helps. Lucas manages to break the ice but falls in when he tries to get Billy out. Both boys fall unconscious while Jason tries to grab Lucas using a hockey stick. He eventually rescues both boys and tries to carry them to get help. Howard then comes back with his father and Billy's father, who take them to a hospital, where they are both saved. While they recover in the hospital, they see on the news that efforts to build the snowmen have been renewed, and students from other schools have come to help. The boys later join them and break the record while discovering that the only lasting legacy is friendship.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Bobby Coleman]]: Billy Kirkfield\n* [[Bobb'e J.
