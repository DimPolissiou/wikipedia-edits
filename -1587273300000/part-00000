It was the last of his books published during his lifetime. Together with his earlier work ''[[Arca No\u00eb]]'' (''Noah's Ark''), it represents Kircher's endeavour to show how modern science supported the Biblical narrative in the [[Book of Genesis]]. The work was also a broad synthesis of many of Kircher's ideas on architecture, language and religion.
