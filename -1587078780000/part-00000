They are usually housed in a specially designed building. Sometimes, an existing venue undergoes a renovation where the existing auditoriums are split into smaller ones, or more auditoriums are added in an extension or expansion of the building. The largest of these complexes can sit thousands of people and are sometimes referred to as a '''megaplex'''.\n\nThe difference between a multiplex and a megaplex is related to the number of [[movie screen|screens]], but the dividing line is not well-defined; some might say that 14 screens and stadium seating make a megaplex; while others might say that at least 20 screens are required.<ref name=\"melnick\">Melnick, Ross & Fuchs, Andrea (2004).

Multiplex theatres often feature regular seating.\n\nThe [[Kinepolis]]-[[Madrid]] [[:es:Ciudad de la Imagen|Ciudad de la Imagen]] megaplex in [[Spain]] is the largest movie theater in the world, with 25 screens and a [[seating capacity]] of 9,200 including a 996-seat auditorium.<ref name=forbesmadrid /><ref name=bostonmadrid /><ref name=filmmadrid />\n\n== History ==\n=== Origins ===\nIn about 1915 two adjacent theatres in Moncton, New Brunswick, under the same ownership were converted to share a single entrance on Main Street. After patrons entered the door, there were separate ticket booths for each theatre, and different programs were shown. The arrangement was so unusual that it was featured by Robert Ripley in his ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!|Believe It or Not!'']]'' comic strip.<ref>Larracey, E. W. (1991). ''The History of Moncton, Volume 2'', Moncton: The City of Moncton, p 127. {{ISBN|0-9694634-2-1}}</ref>\n\nIn 1937 James Edwards twinned his Alhambra Theater in the Los Angeles area by converting an adjacent storefront into a second \"annex\" screen. While both screens would show the same feature movie, one would also offer a double bill. It did not convert to showing different movies on both screens until some time after Nat Taylor (see below).<ref name=\"Cinelog-1\"/> On February 25, 1940, the Patricia Theater made news by becoming what is believed to be the first two-screen theater showing different movies when operator H. Bert Ram added a screen to an adjoining building and shared a common box office. The main screen remained the Patricia Theatre and the Patricia Annex became known as the Little Patricia.<ref>\"Aiken to be 17th City to Show Film (\"Gone with the Wind\"); Little Patricia to Open Same Day.\" Aiken Standard, 14 February 1940, p. 5 and see http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/20886/photos/131821</ref>\n\nIn December 1947 [[Nat Taylor]], the operator of the [[Elgin Theatre (Ottawa)|Elgin Theatre]] in Ottawa, Canada, opened a smaller second theater (\"Little Elgin\") next door to his first theater. It was not until 1957, however, that Taylor decided to run different movies in each theater, when he became annoyed at having to replace films that were still making money with new releases.<ref name=\"Cinelog-1\">{{cite news | url= http://cinelog.org/cinelog/2009/06/27/the-many-births-of-the-multiplex/ | title= The Many Births of the Multiplex | publisher=Cinelog.org | author= | date= June 27, 2009 | accessdate=November 17, 2009}}</ref> Taylor opened dual-screen theaters in 1962 in Place Ville Marie in Montreal, Quebec, and at Yorkdale Plaza in Toronto, Ontario, in 1964.\n\nAlso in late 1947, but in Havana, Cuba, the Duplex movie theater was built to share the vestibule and ancillary facilities with the previously existing Rex Cinema (open since 1938); they were both designed by the same architect, Luis Bonich. The programming was coordinated, so that one of them showed documentary and news reels. while the other was showing feature films.<ref>http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/39388</ref><ref>Melnick, Ross & Andrea Fuchs. Cinema Treasures: A New Look at Classic Movie Theatres. St. Paul: MBI, 2004. Page 147</ref> They were in use at least until the 1990s.\n\nIn 1963 [[AMC Theatres]] opened the two-screen Parkway Twin in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], a concept which company president [[Stanley Durwood|Stan Durwood]] later claimed to have come up with in 1962, realizing he could double the revenue of a single theater \"by adding a second screen and still operate with the same size staff\".<ref name=\"Cinelog-1\"/><ref name=\"klady\">Klady, Leonard. \"[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117743045?categoryid=13&cs=1 Obituaries: Stanley Durwood]\". ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', July 19, 1999, p. 40.</ref> Also, the shopping center structure where the Parkway was located could not support a large theater, so two small theaters were built to avoid that issue, and at first both theaters played the same film. AMC followed up on the Parkway Twin with a four-screen theater in 1966 and a six-screen theater in 1969.<ref name=\"LAT-durwood-obit\">{{cite news|url=http://8.12.42.31/1999/jul/16/news/mn-56705 |title=Stan Durwood; Multiplex Theater Pioneer |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |author= |date=July 16, 1999 |accessdate=November 17, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Durwood's insight was that one box office and one concession stand could easily serve two (or more) attached auditoriums. Another AMC innovation was to offset the starting times of films, so that staff members who previously had downtime while films were playing at a single-auditorium theater would now be kept continuously busy servicing other auditoriums.\n\nIn 1965 Martin's Westgate Cinemas became one of the first indoor two-screen theaters in Atlanta, Georgia. Located in [[East Point, Georgia]], it was later converted into a three-screen venue after a fire partially destroyed one of the theaters. The [[Walt Disney|Disney]] family film ''[[Those Calloways]]'' had its world premier at the Westgate,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059796/releaseinfo|title=Those Calloways (1965)|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=5 April 2018|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref> the only film to have been so honored at that theater.\n\n=== Screen wars ===\nStudio 28 was a cinema multiplex located on 28th Street in [[Wyoming, Michigan]]. Expanding to a maximum of 20 screens, it was the first [[megaplex]], and was once the largest multi-screen cinema complex in the world, opening on [[Christmas|Christmas Day]], 1965, and closing November 23, 2008.http://www.celebrationcinema.com/?pid=30616\n\nStudio 28 started with a single 1,000-seat theater in 1965. It expanded in 1967, adding a second screen dubbed the \"Little Studio\", which commonly showed features for children when the big screen was showing a feature for older audiences, or a film with a niche audience while the main screen showed a more commercial feature. The complex expanded to six screens in 1976, enabling it to accommodate extended runs of the popular [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]] of the era while still having screens for new releases. It expanded further to twelve screens in 1984, and to twenty in 1988.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_28#cite_note-2011TURN-2\n\nOpening in April 1979, the 18-screen Cineplex, co-founded by Nat Taylor in Toronto's [[Toronto Eaton Centre|Eaton Centre]], became the world's largest multitheatre complex under one roof.<ref name=\"LATimes-1\">{{cite news | url= https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/652128592.html?dids=652128592:652128592&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AIPLEX+18%3A+MOVIES+FOR+MANY+TASTES&pqatl=google | title= Cineplex 18: Movies for Many Tastes | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | author= Sid Adilman | date= August 5, 1979 | accessdate=November 17, 2009 |quote=Cineplex opened mid-April...}}</ref> It was expanded to 21 screens by at least 1981.<ref name=\"NYT-multi-1\">{{cite news | url= https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/22/travel/toronto-movie-bazaar.html?&pagewanted=all | title= Toronto Movie Bazaar | work=[[The New York Times]] | author= Andrew H.

Multiplexes were often developed in conjunction with [[big box]] stores in [[power centre (retail)|power center]]s or in suburban malls during the 70s and 80s. The expansion was executed at the big-box pace which left many theater companies bankrupt while attempting to compete \u2014 almost all major movie theater companies went [[bankrupt]] during this hasty development process; however, AMC Theatres and [[Cinemark Theatres]] did not go into bankruptcy. The early U.S. megaplexes sparked a wave of megaplex building across the United States. This was financed in part by a sale-leaseback model with Entertainment Properties Trust.\n\n== Largest cinema complex ==\n[[Kinepolis]] [[Madrid]] opened in Spain on 17 September 1998; it is the world's largest cinema complex in terms of number of seats and has a total seating capacity of 9,200 with 25 screens, each seating between 211 and 996 people.<ref name=forbesmadrid /><ref name=bostonmadrid /><ref name=filmmadrid /> The world's tallest cinema complex is the [[Cineworld (Glasgow)|Cineworld Glasgow Renfrew Street]] in Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom at 203 feet. Opened in 2001, it has 18 screens and seats 4,300 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishcinemas.org.uk/glasgow/ugc.html|title=UGC / Cineworld City Centre|first=G|last=Barr|date=|website=www.scottishcinemas.org.uk|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.attractions.glasgowvant.com/europes-tallest-cinema-cineworld-glasgow-renfrew-st/|title=Cineworld|author=|date=|website=www.attractions.glasgowvant.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Around the world ==\n=== Australia ===\n[[Image:Event Cinemas (6888281952).jpg|thumb|175px|right|[[Event Cinemas]] is the largest film exhibitor in Australia and New Zealand.]]\nThe largest megaplex in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] is the 26-screen Marion MEGAPLEX in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]. The megaplex was originally a 30-screen megaplex branded as [[Greater Union]] but was modified to accommodate Gold Class and V-Max screens and was re-branded as [[Event Cinemas]]. The auditoriums sit on top of [[Westfield Marion]], which is the largest shopping complex in [[Adelaide]].\n\n=== Canada ===\nCanada's largest movie theaters over the years have been located in [[Toronto]]. As mentioned above the 18- (later 21-) screen Cineplex was the movie theater with the most screens in the world until the late 1980s, but remained the largest movie theater in Canada until it was closed at the turn of the 21st century. In 1998, AMC expanded to Canada, building large movie theatres with as many as 24 screens before opening a 30-plex there in 1999, which is the AMC Interchange 30. Then in 2008, the 24-screen [[AMC Theatres|AMC]] Yonge Dundas 24, adjacent to the Eaton Centre, was completed. [[Cineplex Entertainment]] purchased the theater in 2012, along with several other Canadian AMC megaplexes, bringing the company full circle. After that, some more were closed or sold to [[Empire Theatres]]. AMC exited Canada by closing the AMC Interchange 30 in 2014.\n\n=== France ===\nFrance's largest movie theaters are: 27-screen [[UGC (cinema operator)|UGC Cin\u00e9 Cit\u00e9 Les Halles]] (3,913 seats) in [[Paris]], 23-screen [[Kinepolis|Kin\u00e9polis - Ch\u00e2teau du Cin\u00e9ma]] in Lomme (7,286 seats), 22-screen [[UGC (cinema operator)|UGC Cin\u00e9 Cit\u00e9 Strasbourg]] (5,275 seats) and 20-screen MK2 Biblioth\u00e8que in Paris (3,500 seats).\n\n=== Greece ===\nGreece' s largest multiplex is [[Village Cinemas|Village]] [[Agios Ioannis Rentis|Rentis]], that features 18 mainstream screens, two comfort (special type of a mainstream screen, better seating and less auditorium), three [[RealD 3D]] screens and one summer screen. In total it features 21 screens.\n\n=== India ===\nIn [[India]], the mushrooming of multiplexes started since the mid-1990s. Cinema chains such as [[INOX Leisure Limited|INOX]], [[PVR (Priya Village Roadshow)|PVR]], [[Carnival Cinemas]], [[SPI Cinemas]], [[Cinepolis]] and [[Big Cinemas]] operate multiplexes across the country. The largest multiplex in India is the 16-screen megaplex [[Mayajaal]] in [[chennai]].\n\n=== Netherlands ===\nIn the [[Netherlands]] there weren't many multiplexes until the millennial change. In April 2000 [[Path\u00e9 ArenA]] opened its doors in the [[ArenAPoort]] area in [[Amsterdam]]. It's the largest multiplex in the [[Netherlands]] and features 14 screens and 3250 seats in total. Nowadays{{when|date=January 2020}} a lot of other multiplexes are being set up, but so far none of them have surpassed Path\u00e9 ArenA's capacity.\n\n=== Spain ===\nMultiplexes (''multicines'') are very popular in Spain and they can be found in or close to most cities, displacing the traditional single-screen theaters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/221247/0/cines/butacas/salas/|title=Aumenta n\u00famero de salas de cine en Espa\u00f1a, aunque cada vez son m\u00e1s peque\u00f1as|first=|last=20Minutos|date=|website=20minutos.es|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref> Many middle-sized and large cities have several of them, and they are also common in [[Shopping mall|malls]].

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', July 19, 1999, p. 40.</ref> Also, the shopping center structure where the Parkway was located could not support a large theater, so two small theaters were built to avoid that issue, and at first both theaters played the same film. AMC followed up on the Parkway Twin with a four-screen theater in 1966 and a six-screen theater in 1969.<ref name=\"LAT-durwood-obit\">{{cite news|url=http://8.12.42.31/1999/jul/16/news/mn-56705 |title=Stan Durwood; Multiplex Theater Pioneer |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |author= |date=July 16, 1999 |accessdate=November 17, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Durwood's insight was that one box office and one concession stand could easily serve two (or more) attached auditoriums. Another AMC innovation was to offset the starting times of films, so that staff members who previously had downtime while films were playing at a single-auditorium theater would now be kept continuously busy servicing other auditoriums.\n\nIn 1965 Martin's Westgate Cinemas became one of the first indoor two-screen theaters in Atlanta, Georgia. Located in [[East Point, Georgia]], it was later converted into a three-screen venue after a fire partially destroyed one of the theaters. The [[Walt Disney|Disney]] family film ''[[Those Calloways]]'' had its world premier at the Westgate,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059796/releaseinfo|title=Those Calloways (1965)|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=5 April 2018|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref> the only film to have been so honored at that theater.\n\n=== Screen wars ===\n'''Studio 28''' was a cinema multiplex located on 28th Street in [[Wyoming, Michigan]]. Expanding to a maximum of 20 screens, it was the first [[megaplex]], and was once the largest multi-screen cinema complex in the world, opening on [[Christmas|Christmas Day]], 1965, and closing November 23, 2008.http://www.celebrationcinema.com/?pid=30616\n\nStudio 28 started with a single 1,000-seat theater in 1965. It expanded in 1967, adding a second screen dubbed the \"Little Studio\", which commonly showed features for children when the big screen was showing a feature for older audiences, or a film with a niche audience while the main screen showed a more commercial feature. The complex expanded to six screens in 1976, enabling it to accommodate extended runs of the popular [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]] of the era while still having screens for new releases. It expanded further to twelve screens in 1984, and to twenty in 1988.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_28#cite_note-2011TURN-2\n\nOpening in April 1979, the 18-screen Cineplex, co-founded by Nat Taylor in Toronto's [[Toronto Eaton Centre|Eaton Centre]], became the world's largest multitheatre complex under one roof.<ref name=\"LATimes-1\">{{cite news | url= https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/652128592.html?dids=652128592:652128592&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AIPLEX+18%3A+MOVIES+FOR+MANY+TASTES&pqatl=google | title= Cineplex 18: Movies for Many Tastes | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | author= Sid Adilman | date= August 5, 1979 | accessdate=November 17, 2009 |quote=Cineplex opened mid-April...}}</ref> It was expanded to 21 screens by at least 1981.<ref name=\"NYT-multi-1\">{{cite news | url= https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/22/travel/toronto-movie-bazaar.html?&pagewanted=all | title= Toronto Movie Bazaar | work=[[The New York Times]] | author= Andrew H.

Multiplexes were often developed in conjunction with [[big box]] stores in [[power centre (retail)|power center]]s or in suburban malls during the 70s and 80s. The expansion was executed at the big-box pace which left many theater companies bankrupt while attempting to compete \u2014 almost all major movie theater companies went [[bankrupt]] during this hasty development process; however, AMC Theatres and [[Cinemark Theatres]] did not go into bankruptcy. The early U.S. megaplexes sparked a wave of megaplex building across the United States. This was financed in part by a sale-leaseback model with Entertainment Properties Trust.\n\n== Largest cinema complex ==\n[[Kinepolis]] [[Madrid]] opened in Spain on 17 September 1998; it is the world's largest cinema complex in terms of number of seats and has a total seating capacity of 9,200 with 25 screens, each seating between 211 and 996 people.<ref name=forbesmadrid /><ref name=bostonmadrid /><ref name=filmmadrid /> The world's tallest cinema complex is the [[Cineworld (Glasgow)|Cineworld Glasgow Renfrew Street]] in Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom at 203 feet. Opened in 2001, it has 18 screens and seats 4,300 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishcinemas.org.uk/glasgow/ugc.html|title=UGC / Cineworld City Centre|first=G|last=Barr|date=|website=www.scottishcinemas.org.uk|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.attractions.glasgowvant.com/europes-tallest-cinema-cineworld-glasgow-renfrew-st/|title=Cineworld|author=|date=|website=www.attractions.glasgowvant.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Around the world ==\n=== Australia ===\n[[Image:Event Cinemas (6888281952).jpg|thumb|175px|right|[[Event Cinemas]] is the largest film exhibitor in Australia and New Zealand.]]\nThe largest megaplex in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] is the 26-screen Marion MEGAPLEX in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]. The megaplex was originally a 30-screen megaplex branded as [[Greater Union]] but was modified to accommodate Gold Class and V-Max screens and was re-branded as [[Event Cinemas]]. The auditoriums sit on top of [[Westfield Marion]], which is the largest shopping complex in [[Adelaide]].\n\n=== Canada ===\nCanada's largest movie theaters over the years have been located in [[Toronto]]. As mentioned above the 18- (later 21-) screen Cineplex was the movie theater with the most screens in the world until the late 1980s, but remained the largest movie theater in Canada until it was closed at the turn of the 21st century. In 1998, AMC expanded to Canada, building large movie theatres with as many as 24 screens before opening a 30-plex there in 1999, which is the AMC Interchange 30. Then in 2008, the 24-screen [[AMC Theatres|AMC]] Yonge Dundas 24, adjacent to the Eaton Centre, was completed. [[Cineplex Entertainment]] purchased the theater in 2012, along with several other Canadian AMC megaplexes, bringing the company full circle. After that, some more were closed or sold to [[Empire Theatres]]. AMC exited Canada by closing the AMC Interchange 30 in 2014.\n\n=== France ===\nFrance's largest movie theaters are: 27-screen [[UGC (cinema operator)|UGC Cin\u00e9 Cit\u00e9 Les Halles]] (3,913 seats) in [[Paris]], 23-screen [[Kinepolis|Kin\u00e9polis - Ch\u00e2teau du Cin\u00e9ma]] in Lomme (7,286 seats), 22-screen [[UGC (cinema operator)|UGC Cin\u00e9 Cit\u00e9 Strasbourg]] (5,275 seats) and 20-screen MK2 Biblioth\u00e8que in Paris (3,500 seats).\n\n=== Greece ===\nGreece' s largest multiplex is [[Village Cinemas|Village]] [[Agios Ioannis Rentis|Rentis]], that features 18 mainstream screens, two comfort (special type of a mainstream screen, better seating and less auditorium), three [[RealD 3D]] screens and one summer screen. In total it features 21 screens.\n\n=== India ===\nIn [[India]], the mushrooming of multiplexes started since the mid-1990s. Cinema chains such as [[INOX Leisure Limited|INOX]], [[PVR (Priya Village Roadshow)|PVR]], [[Carnival Cinemas]], [[SPI Cinemas]], [[Cinepolis]] and [[Big Cinemas]] operate multiplexes across the country. The largest multiplex in India is the 16-screen megaplex [[Mayajaal]] in [[chennai]].\n\n=== Netherlands ===\nIn the [[Netherlands]] there weren't many multiplexes until the millennial change. In April 2000 [[Path\u00e9 ArenA]] opened its doors in the [[ArenAPoort]] area in [[Amsterdam]]. It's the largest multiplex in the [[Netherlands]] and features 14 screens and 3250 seats in total. Nowadays{{when|date=January 2020}} a lot of other multiplexes are being set up, but so far none of them have surpassed Path\u00e9 ArenA's capacity.\n\n=== Spain ===\nMultiplexes (''multicines'') are very popular in Spain and they can be found in or close to most cities, displacing the traditional single-screen theaters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/221247/0/cines/butacas/salas/|title=Aumenta n\u00famero de salas de cine en Espa\u00f1a, aunque cada vez son m\u00e1s peque\u00f1as|first=|last=20Minutos|date=|website=20minutos.es|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref> Many middle-sized and large cities have several of them, and they are also common in [[Shopping mall|malls]].

The bulbs are slender, conical, {{convert|2|\u2013|3|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} long and {{convert|1|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} broad, and grow in dense clusters from the [[root]]s. The scapes (or stems) are hollow and tubular, up to {{convert|50|cm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2|\u2013|3|mm|abbr=on|frac=16}} across, with a soft texture, although, prior to the emergence of a flower, they may appear stiffer than usual. The grass-like<ref name=\"Linford\"/> leaves, which are shorter than the scapes, are also hollow and tubular, or terete, (round in cross-section) which distinguishes it at a glance from [[Allium tuberosum|garlic chives]] (''Allium tuberosum''). The [[flower]]s are pale purple, and star-shaped with six [[petal]]s, {{convert|1|\u2013|2|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} wide, and produced in a dense [[inflorescence]] of 10-30 together; before opening, the inflorescence is surrounded by a papery [[bract]]. The [[seed]]s are produced in a small, three-valved capsule, maturing in summer. The herb flowers from April to May in the southern parts of its habitat zones and in June in the northern parts.<ref>[http://www.mobot.org/gardeninghelp/plantfinder/Plant.asp?code=J270 Allium schoenoprasum factsheet], from Kemper center for home gardening, retrieved on June 13, 2006, based on the position of the botanical Garden (Missouri)</ref><ref>[http://linnaeus.nrm.se/flora/mono/allia/alliu/allisch.html Gr\u00e4sl\u00f6k], from Den virtuella floran, retrieved on June 13, 2006, The facts mentioned on the site apply to Sweden, which is in the northern part of the habitat zone.</ref>\n\nChives are the only species of ''Allium'' native to both the [[New world|New]] and the [[Old World]]s.

{"title_page": "On the Jewish Question", "text_new": "{{for|similar terms|Jewish question (disambiguation)}}\n{{Marxism}}\n\n\"'''On the Jewish Question'''\" is a work by [[Karl Marx]], written in 1843, and first published in Paris in 1844 under the German title \"'''Zur Judenfrage'''\" in the ''[[Deutsch\u2013Franz\u00f6sische Jahrb\u00fccher]].'' It was one of Marx's first attempts to develop what would later be called the [[Historical materialism|materialist conception of history]].\n\nThe essay criticizes two studies<ref>Bruno Bauer, ''Die Judenfrage''(''The Jewish Question''), Braunschweig 1843</ref><ref>Bruno Bauer: \"Die F\u00e4higkeit der heutigen Juden und Christen, frei zu werden\" (\"The Capacity of Present-day Jews and Christians to Become Free\"), in: ''Einundzwanzig Bogen aus der Schweiz'', edited by [[Georg Herwegh]], Z\u00fcrich and Winterthur, 1843, pp. 56\u201371.</ref> by Marx's fellow [[Young Hegelian]] [[Bruno Bauer]] on the attempt by Jews to achieve [[political emancipation]] in [[Prussia]]. Bauer argued that Jews could achieve political emancipation only by relinquishing their particular religious consciousness, since political emancipation requires a [[secular state]], which he assumes does not leave any \"space\" for social identities such as religion. According to Bauer, such religious demands are incompatible with the idea of the \"[[Rights of Man]]\". True political emancipation, for Bauer, requires the abolition of religion.\n\nMarx uses Bauer's essay as an occasion for his own analysis of [[Liberalism|liberal]] rights, arguing that Bauer is mistaken in his assumption that in a \"secular state\" religion will no longer play a prominent role in social life, and giving as an example the pervasiveness of religion in the United States, which, unlike Prussia, had no [[state religion]]. In Marx's analysis, the \"secular state\" is not opposed to religion, but rather actually presupposes it. The removal of religious or property qualifications for citizens does not mean the abolition of religion or property, but only introduces a way of regarding individuals in [[abstraction]] from them.<ref>Marx 1844:<blockquote>[T]he political annulment of private property not only fails to abolish private property but even presupposes it. The state abolishes, in its own way, distinctions of birth, social rank, education, occupation, when it declares that birth, social rank, education, occupation, are non-political distinctions, when it proclaims, without regard to these distinctions, that every member of the nation is an equal participant in [[national sovereignty]], when it treats all elements of the real life of the nation from the standpoint of the state. Nevertheless, the state allows private property, education, occupation, to act in their way \u2013 i.e., as [[private property]], as education, as occupation, and to exert the influence of their special nature. Far from abolishing these real distinctions, the state only exists on the presupposition of their existence; it feels itself to be a political state and asserts its universality only in opposition to these elements of its being.</blockquote></ref>\n\nOn this note Marx moves beyond the question of [[religious freedom]] to his real concern with Bauer's analysis of \"political emancipation\". Marx concludes that while individuals can be \"spiritually\" and \"politically\" free in a secular state, they can still be bound to material constraints on freedom by [[economic inequality]], an assumption that would later form the basis of his [[criticism of capitalism|critiques of capitalism]].\n\nA number of scholars and commentators regard \"On the Jewish Question\", and in particular its second section, which addresses Bauer's work \"The Capacity of Present-day Jews and Christians to Become Free\", as [[antisemitic]];<ref name=\"P Johnson 1984 Commentary Mag\">Paul Johnson, 1984.

As noted above, political emancipation in a modern state does ''not'' require the Jews (or, for that matter, the Christians) to renounce religion; only complete human emancipation would involve the disappearance of religion, but that is not yet possible \"within the hitherto existing world order\".\n\nIn the second part of the essay, Marx disputes Bauer's \"theological\" analysis of Judaism and its relation to Christianity. Bauer has stated that the renouncing of religion would be especially difficult for Jews, because Judaism is, in his view, a primitive stage in the development of Christianity.{{Clarify|date=February 2016}} Hence, to achieve freedom by renouncing religion, the Christians would have to surmount only one stage, whereas the Jews would need to surmount two. In response to this, Marx argues that the Jewish religion does not need to be attached to the significance it has in Bauer's analysis, because it is only a spiritual reflection of Jewish economic life. This is the starting point of a complex and somewhat metaphorical argument which draws on the stereotype of the Jew as a financially apt \"huckster\" and posits a special connection between Judaism as a religion and the economy of contemporary bourgeois society. Thus, the Jewish religion does not need to disappear in society, as Bauer argues, because it is actually a natural part of it.{{Clarify|date=February 2016}} Having thus figuratively equated \"practical Judaism\" with \"huckstering and money\", Marx concludes, that \"the Christians have become Jews\"; and, ultimately, it is mankind (both Christians and Jews<ref>Marx 1844:<blockquote>On the other hand, if the Jew recognizes that his practical nature is futile and works to abolish it, he extricates himself from his previous development and works for human emancipation as such and turns against the supreme practical expression of human self-estrangement.\n</blockquote></ref>) that needs to emancipate itself from (\"practical\") Judaism.\n\nThe second part of Marx's essay is frequently cited as evidence of Marx's antisemitism:<ref name=\"P Johnson 1984 Commentary Mag\"/><ref name=\"Marx 1844\">Marx 1844</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Let us consider the actual, worldly Jew \u2013 not the [[Sabbath]] Jew, as Bauer does, but the everyday Jew. Let us not look for the secret of the Jew in his religion, but let us look for the secret of his religion in the real Jew.\nWhat is the secular basis of Judaism? Practical need, self-interest. What is the worldly religion of the Jew? [[Huckster]]ing. What is his worldly God? Money. Money is the jealous god of Israel, in face of which no other god may exist. Money degrades all the gods of man \u2013 and turns them into commodities\u2026. The bill of exchange is the real god of the Jew. His god is only an illusory bill of exchange\u2026. The chimerical nationality of the Jew is the nationality of the merchant, of the man of money in general.[...] The Jew has emancipated himself in a Jewish manner, not only because he has acquired financial power, but also because, through him and also apart from him, money has become a world power and the practical Jewish spirit has become the practical spirit of the Christian nations. The Jews have emancipated themselves insofar as the Christians have become Jews. [...] In the final analysis, the emancipation of the Jews is the emancipation of mankind from Judaism.</blockquote>\n\n==History of essay publication==\n\n\"Zur Judenfrage\" was first published by Marx and [[Arnold Ruge]] in February 1844 in the ''[[Deutsch\u2013Franz\u00f6sische Jahrb\u00fccher]]'', a [[Magazine|journal]] which ran only one issue.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last1=Ruge|editor-first1=Arnold|editor-last2=Marx|editor-first2=Karl|title=Deutsch\u2013Franz\u00f6sische Jahrb\u00fccher|location=Leipzig|publisher=Reclam|year=1981}}</ref>  From December 1843 to October 1844, Bruno Bauer published the monthly ''Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung'' (General Literary Gazette) in [[Charlottenburg]] (now Berlin). In it, he responded to the critique of his own essays on the Jewish question by Marx and others. Then, in 1845, [[Friedrich Engels]] and Marx published a polemic critique of the Young Hegelians titled ''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]''. In parts<ref>Engels, Marx: ''The Holy Family'' 1845, Chapter VI, The Jewish Question [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/holy-family/ch06.htm#6.1.b No. 1], [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/holy-family/ch06_2.htm#6.2.b No. 2], [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/holy-family/ch06_3_b.htm No. 3]</ref> of the book, Marx again presented his views dissenting from Bauer's on the Jewish question and on political and human emancipation.\n\nA French translation appeared 1850 in Paris in Hermann Ewerbeck's book ''Qu'est-ce que la bible d'apr\u00e8s la nouvelle philosophie allemande?'' (''What is the Bible according to the new German philosophy?'').\n\nIn 1879, historian [[Heinrich von Treitschke]] published an article \"Unsere Aussichten\" (\"Our Prospects\"), in which he demanded that the Jews should assimilate to German culture, and described Jewish immigrants as a danger for Germany. This article would stir a controversy, to which the newspaper ''Sozialdemokrat'', edited by [[Eduard Bernstein]], reacted by republishing almost the entire second part of \"Zur Judenfrage\" in June and July 1881.\n\nThe whole essay was republished in October 1890 in the ''Berliner Volksblatt'', then edited by [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]].<ref name=MEGA>''Marx-Engels Gesammtausgabe (MEGA)'', Volume II, apparatus, p. 648 ('''German''') Dietz, Berlin 1982</ref>\n\nIn 1926, an English translation by [[H. J. Stenning]], with the title \"On the Jewish Question\", appeared in a collection of essays by Marx.<ref>Karl Marx ''Selected Essays'', translated by H. J. Stenning (Leonard Parsons, London and New York 1926), pp. 40\u201397</ref>\n\nA translation of \"Zur Judenfrage\" was published together with other articles of Marx in 1959 under the title ''[[A World Without Jews]]''.<ref>[http://www.worldsocialism.org/canada/world.without.jews.1960.v27n212.htm A World Without Jews], review in: ''[[The Western Socialist]]'', Vol. 27, No. 212, No. 1, 1960, pp. 5\u20137</ref> The editor [[Dagobert D.

According to Maccoby, Marx argues in the essay that the modern commercialized world is the triumph of Judaism, a pseudo-religion whose god is money. Maccoby has suggested that Marx was embarrassed by his Jewish background and used the Jews as a \"yardstick of evil\". Maccoby writes that in later years, Marx limited what he considers to be antipathy towards Jews to private letters and conversations because of strong public identification with antisemitism by his political enemies both on the left ([[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin]]) and on the right (aristocracy and the Church).<ref name=\"Hyam Maccoby 2006 pp. 64\u201366\"/> [[Bernard Lewis]] has described \"On the Jewish Question\" as \"one of the classics of antisemitic propaganda\".<ref name=\"Bernard Lewis 1999 p. 112\"/> According to several scholars, Marx considered Jews to be the embodiment of capitalism and the representation of all its evils.<ref name=\"Edward H 2004 p. 168\"/>\n\n[[Abram Leon]] in his book ''The Jewish Question'' (published 1946)<ref>Leon 1950, [http://www.marxists.de/religion/leon/ch1.htm Chapter One], Premises</ref> examines Jewish history from a materialist outlook.

Bauer argued that Jews could achieve political emancipation only by relinquishing their particular religious consciousness, since political emancipation requires a [[secular state]], which he assumes does not leave any \"space\" for social identities such as religion. According to Bauer, such religious demands are incompatible with the idea of the \"[[Rights of Man]]\". True political emancipation, for Bauer, requires the abolition of religion.\n\nMarx uses Bauer's essay as an occasion for his own analysis of [[Liberalism|liberal]] rights, arguing that Bauer is mistaken in his assumption that in a \"secular state\" religion will no longer play a prominent role in social life, and giving as an example the pervasiveness of religion in the United States, which, unlike Prussia, had no [[state religion]]. In Marx's analysis, the \"secular state\" is not opposed to religion, but rather actually presupposes it. The removal of religious or property qualifications for citizens does not mean the abolition of religion or property, but only introduces a way of regarding individuals in [[abstraction]] from them.<ref>Marx 1844:<blockquote>[T]he political annulment of private property not only fails to abolish private property but even presupposes it. The state abolishes, in its own way, distinctions of birth, social rank, education, occupation, when it declares that birth, social rank, education, occupation, are non-political distinctions, when it proclaims, without regard to these distinctions, that every member of the nation is an equal participant in [[national sovereignty]], when it treats all elements of the real life of the nation from the standpoint of the state. Nevertheless, the state allows private property, education, occupation, to act in their way \u2013 i.e., as [[private property]], as education, as occupation, and to exert the influence of their special nature. Far from abolishing these real distinctions, the state only exists on the presupposition of their existence; it feels itself to be a political state and asserts its universality only in opposition to these elements of its being.</blockquote></ref>\n\nOn this note Marx moves beyond the question of [[religious freedom]] to his real concern with Bauer's analysis of \"political emancipation\". Marx concludes that while individuals can be \"spiritually\" and \"politically\" free in a secular state, they can still be bound to material constraints on freedom by [[economic inequality]], an assumption that would later form the basis of his [[criticism of capitalism|critiques of capitalism]].\n\nA number of scholars and commentators regard \"On the Jewish Question\", and in particular its second section, which addresses Bauer's work \"The Capacity of Present-day Jews and Christians to Become Free\", as [[antisemitic]];<ref name=\"P Johnson 1984 Commentary Mag\">Paul Johnson, 1984.

As noted above, political emancipation in a modern state does ''not'' require the Jews (or, for that matter, the Christians) to renounce religion; only complete human emancipation would involve the disappearance of religion, but that is not yet possible \"within the hitherto existing world order\".\n\nIn the second part of the essay, Marx disputes Bauer's \"theological\" analysis of Judaism and its relation to Christianity. Bauer has stated that the renouncing of religion would be especially difficult for Jews, because Judaism is, in his view, a primitive stage in the development of Christianity.{{Clarify|date=February 2016}} Hence, to achieve freedom by renouncing religion, the Christians would have to surmount only one stage, whereas the Jews would need to surmount two. In response to this, Marx argues that the Jewish religion does not need to be attached to the significance it has in Bauer's analysis, because it is only a spiritual reflection of Jewish economic life. This is the starting point of a complex and somewhat metaphorical argument which draws on the stereotype of the Jew as a financially apt \"huckster\" and posits a special connection between Judaism as a religion and the economy of contemporary bourgeois society. Thus, the Jewish religion does not need to disappear in society, as Bauer argues, because it is actually a natural part of it.{{Clarify|date=February 2016}} Having thus figuratively equated \"practical Judaism\" with \"huckstering and money\", Marx concludes, that \"the Christians have become Jews\"; and, ultimately, it is mankind (both Christians and Jews<ref>Marx 1844:<blockquote>On the other hand, if the Jew recognizes that his practical nature is futile and works to abolish it, he extricates himself from his previous development and works for human emancipation as such and turns against the supreme practical expression of human self-estrangement.\n</blockquote></ref> that needs to emancipate itself from (\"practical\") Judaism.\n\nThe second part of Marx's essay is frequently cited as evidence of Marx's antisemitism:<ref name=\"P Johnson 1984 Commentary Mag\"/><ref name=\"Marx 1844\">Marx 1844</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Let us consider the actual, worldly Jew \u2013 not the [[Sabbath]] Jew, as Bauer does, but the everyday Jew. Let us not look for the secret of the Jew in his religion, but let us look for the secret of his religion in the real Jew.\nWhat is the secular basis of Judaism? Practical need, self-interest. What is the worldly religion of the Jew? [[Huckster]]ing. What is his worldly God? Money. Money is the jealous god of Israel, in face of which no other god may exist. Money degrades all the gods of man \u2013 and turns them into commodities\u2026. The bill of exchange is the real god of the Jew. His god is only an illusory bill of exchange\u2026. The chimerical nationality of the Jew is the nationality of the merchant, of the man of money in general.[...] The Jew has emancipated himself in a Jewish manner, not only because he has acquired financial power, but also because, through him and also apart from him, money has become a world power and the practical Jewish spirit has become the practical spirit of the Christian nations. The Jews have emancipated themselves insofar as the Christians have become Jews. [...] In the final analysis, the emancipation of the Jews is the emancipation of mankind from Judaism.</blockquote>\n\n==History of essay publication==\n\n\"Zur Judenfrage\" was first published by Marx and [[Arnold Ruge]] in February 1844 in the ''[[Deutsch\u2013Franz\u00f6sische Jahrb\u00fccher]]'', a [[Magazine|journal]] which ran only one issue.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last1=Ruge|editor-first1=Arnold|editor-last2=Marx|editor-first2=Karl|title=Deutsch\u2013Franz\u00f6sische Jahrb\u00fccher|location=Leipzig|publisher=Reclam|year=1981}}</ref>  From December 1843 to October 1844, Bruno Bauer published the monthly ''Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung'' (General Literary Gazette) in [[Charlottenburg]] (now Berlin). In it, he responded to the critique of his own essays on the Jewish question by Marx and others. Then, in 1845, [[Friedrich Engels]] and Marx published a polemic critique of the Young Hegelians titled ''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]''. In parts<ref>Engels, Marx: ''The Holy Family'' 1845, Chapter VI, The Jewish Question [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/holy-family/ch06.htm#6.1.b No. 1], [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/holy-family/ch06_2.htm#6.2.b No. 2], [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/holy-family/ch06_3_b.htm No. 3]</ref> of the book, Marx again presented his views dissenting from Bauer's on the Jewish question and on political and human emancipation.\n\nA French translation appeared 1850 in Paris in Hermann Ewerbeck's book ''Qu'est-ce que la bible d'apr\u00e8s la nouvelle philosophie allemande?'' (''What is the Bible according to the new German philosophy?'').\n\nIn 1879, historian [[Heinrich von Treitschke]] published an article \"Unsere Aussichten\" (\"Our Prospects\"), in which he demanded that the Jews should assimilate to German culture, and described Jewish immigrants as a danger for Germany. This article would stir a controversy, to which the newspaper ''Sozialdemokrat'', edited by [[Eduard Bernstein]], reacted by republishing almost the entire second part of \"Zur Judenfrage\" in June and July 1881.\n\nThe whole essay was republished in October 1890 in the ''Berliner Volksblatt'', then edited by [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]].<ref name=MEGA>''Marx-Engels Gesammtausgabe (MEGA)'', Volume II, apparatus, p. 648 ('''German''') Dietz, Berlin 1982</ref>\n\nIn 1926, an English translation by [[H.

According to Maccoby, Marx argues in the essay that the modern commercialized world is the triumph of Judaism, a pseudo-religion whose god is money. Maccoby has suggested that Marx was embarrassed by his Jewish background and used the Jews as a \"yardstick of evil\". Maccoby writes that in later years, Marx limited what he considers to be antipathy towards Jews to private letters and conversations because of strong public identification with antisemitism by his political enemies both on the left ([[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin]]) and on the right (aristocracy and the Church).<ref name=\"Hyam Maccoby 2006 pp. 64\u201366\"/> [[Bernard Lewis]] has described \"On the Jewish Question\" as \"one of the classics of antisemitic propaganda\".<ref name=\"Bernard Lewis 1999 p. 112\"/> According to several scholars, Marx considered Jews to be the embodiment of capitalism and the representation of all its evils.<ref name=\"Edward H 2004 p. 168\"/>\n\n[[Abram Leon]] in his book ''The Jewish Question'' (published 1946)<ref>Leon 1950, [http://www.marxists.de/religion/leon/ch1.htm Chapter One], Premises</ref> examines Jewish history from a materialist outlook. According to Leon, Marx's essay states that one \"must not start with religion in order to explain Jewish history; on the contrary: the preservation of the Jewish religion or nationality can be explained only by the 'real Jew', that is to say, by the Jew in his economic and social role\".\n\nA notable expert on antisemitism, [[Robert Wistrich]], stated \"the net result of Marx's essay is to reinforce a traditional anti-Jewish stereotype \u2013 the identification of the Jews with money-making \u2013 in the sharpest possible manner\".<ref name=\"R.

He explains that with the fact that while he dislikes Judaism as a religion, he also remains unconvinced by Bauer's view (that the Jews should not be emancipated before they abandon Judaism). However, he also clarifies in the letter that his support of the petition is merely tactical, to further his efforts at weakening the Christian state.\n\nIn his book ''[[For Marx]]'' (1965), [[Louis Althusser]] claims that \"in ''On the Jewish Question'', ''[[Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right|Hegel's Philosophy of the State]]'', etc., and even usually in ''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]'' that \"...&nbsp;Marx was merely applying the theory of alienation, that is, [[Ludwig Feuerbach|Feuerbach]]'s theory of 'human nature', to politics and the concrete activity of man, before extending it (in large part) to political economy in the ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844|Manuscripts]]''\".<ref>Althusser 1965, Part One:[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1960/feuerbach.htm Feuerbach's 'Philosophical Manifestoes'], first published in ''La Nouvelle Critique'', December 1960.</ref> He opposes a tendency according to which \"''[[Das Kapital|Capital]]'' is no longer read as 'On the Jewish Question', 'On the Jewish Question' is read as 'Capital{{'\"}}.<ref>Althusser 1965, Part Two: [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1961/young-marx.htm On the Young Marx: Theoretical Questions], first appeared in ''La Pens\u00e9e'', March\u2013April 1961</ref> For Althusser, the essay \"is a profoundly \"ideological text\", \"committed to the struggle for Communism\", but without being Marxist; \"so it cannot, theoretically, be identified with the later texts which were to define [[historical materialism]]\".<ref>Althusser 1965, Part Five: [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/althusser/1962/economy-philosophy.htm \"The 1844 Manuscripts\"], first published in ''La Pens\u00e9e'', February 1963.</ref>\n\n[[David McLellan (academic)|David McLellan]], however, has argued that \"On the Jewish Question\" must be understood in terms of Marx's debates with Bruno Bauer over the nature of political emancipation in Germany. According to McLellan, Marx used the word \"Judentum\" in its colloquial sense of \"commerce\" to argue that Germans suffer, and must be emancipated from, capitalism. The second half of Marx's essay, McLellan concludes, should be read as \"an extended pun at Bauer's expense\".<ref name=\"McLellan\">David McLellan: ''Marx before Marxism'' (1970), pp. 141\u2013142</ref>\n\n[[Hal Draper]] (1977)<ref>Draper 1977</ref> observed that the language of Part II of \"On the Jewish Question\" followed the view of the Jews' role given in Jewish socialist [[Moses Hess]]' essay \"On the Money System\".\n\n[[Stephen Greenblatt]] (1978)<ref>Stephen J.

According to Greenblatt, \"[b]oth writers hope to focus attention upon activity that is seen as at once alien and yet central to the life of the community and to direct against that activity the antisemitic feeling of the audience\". Greenblatt attributes to Marx a \"sharp, even hysterical, denial of his religious background\".\n\nYoav Peled (1992)<ref>Y.

In Peled's view, \"this was less than a satisfactory response to Bauer, but it enabled Marx to present a powerful case for emancipation while, at the same time, launching his critique of economic alienation\". He concludes that \"the philosophical advances made by Marx in 'On the Jewish Question' were necessitated by, and integrally related to, his commitment to Jewish emancipation\".\n\nOthers argue that \"On the Jewish Question\" is primarily a critique of liberal rights, rather than a criticism of Judaism, and that apparently antisemitic passages such as \"Money is the jealous god of Israel, in face of which no other god may exist\" should be read in that context.<ref name=\"Brown\">{{Cite book | last=Brown | first=Wendy | author-link=Wendy Brown (political scientist) | year=1995 | contribution=Rights and Identity in Late Modernity: Revisiting the 'Jewish Question' | editor-last=Sarat | editor-first=Austin | editor2-last=Kearns | editor2-first=Thomas | title=Identities, Politics, and Rights | publisher=University of Michigan Press | pages=85\u2013130 | postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nFor sociologist [[Robert Fine]] (2006)<ref>Robert Fine: [http://www.engageonline.org.uk/journal/index.php?journal_id=10&article_id=33 Karl Marx and the Radical Critique of Anti-Semitism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205162327/http://www.engageonline.org.uk/journal/index.php?journal_id=10&article_id=33 |date=2012-02-05 }} in: ''[[Engage (organization)|Engage]] Journal'' 2, May 2006</ref> Bauer's essay \"echoed the generally prejudicial representation of the Jew as 'merchant' and 'moneyman{{'\"}}, whereas \"Marx's aim was to defend the right of Jews to full civil and political emancipation (that is, to equal civil and political rights) alongside all other German citizens\".

Ray translates a sentence of \"Zur Judenfrage\" and interprets it as an assimilationist position \"in which there is no room within emancipated humanity for Jews as a separate ethnic or cultural identity\", and which advocates \"a society where both cultural as well as economic difference is eliminated\". Here Ray sees Marx in a \"strand of left thinking that has been unable to address forms of oppression not directly linked to class\".\n\nThe political-scientist Professor Iain Hamphsher-Monk wrote in his textbook: \"This work [\"On The Jewish Question\"] has been cited as evidence for Marx's supposed antisemitism, but only the most superficial reading of it could sustain such an interpretation.\"<ref name=\"Hampsher-Monk\">Iain Hampsher-Monk, ''A History of Modern Political Thought'' (1992), Blackwell Publishing, p. 496</ref> [[Francis Wheen]] says: \"Those critics, who see this as a foretaste of 'Mein Kampf', overlook one, essential point: in spite of the clumsy phraseology and crude stereotyping, the essay was actually written as a defense of the Jews.
