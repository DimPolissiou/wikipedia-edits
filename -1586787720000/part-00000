{"title_page": "Adaptations of The Chronicles of Narnia", "text_new": "'''''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]''''' is a [[heptalogy|series of seven]] [[fantasy]] [[novel]]s for children written by [[C. S. Lewis]]. It is considered a classic of [[children's literature]] and is the author's best-known work, having sold over 100 million copies in 47 languages. Written by Lewis between 1949 and 1954, illustrated by [[Pauline Baynes]] and published in London between October 1950 and March 1956, ''The Chronicles of Narnia'' has been adapted several times, complete or in part, for television, radio, the stage, film, in audio books, and as video games.\n\n==Television==\n''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' was [[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1967 TV serial)|first adapted for television in 1967]]. The ten episodes, each thirty minutes long, were directed by Helen Standage. The screenplay was written by [[Trevor Preston]] and unlike subsequent adaptations, it is currently unavailable to purchase for home viewing.\n\n''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' was [[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1979 film)|adapted for television again in 1979]], this time as an [[Animated cartoon|animated]] special co-produced by [[Bill Mel\u00e9ndez]] (known for ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'' and other Peanuts specials) and the [[Children's Television Workshop]] (known for programs such as ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and ''[[The Electric Company]]''). The screenplay was by David D. Connell. It won the [[Emmy award]] for Outstanding Animated Program that year. It was the first feature-length animated film ever made for television. For its release on British television, many of the characters' voices were re-recorded by British actors and actresses (including [[Leo McKern]], [[Arthur Lowe]] and [[Sheila Hancock]]), but [[Stephen Thorne]] was the voice of \"Aslan\" in both the U.S. and British versions.\n\nFrom 1988\u201390, parts of ''The Chronicles of Narnia'' were turned into three successful [[BBC]] television [[Serial (radio and television)|serials]], ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia (TV serial)|The Chronicles of Narnia]]'', based on the first four of the seven books. All three were shown on the PBS show [[WonderWorks]] and they were nominated for a total of 14 awards, including an [[Emmy]] in the category of \"Outstanding Children's Program\".  The three serials were later released as three feature-length films and released on VHS and DVD.\n\nOn October 3, 2018, the C.S. Lewis Company announced that [[Netflix]] had acquired the rights to new film and television series adaptations of the Narnia books.<ref>{{cite web|title = NETFLIX TO DEVELOP SERIES AND FILMS BASED ON C.S.

They have also been re-released in 2005 ({{ISBN|978-0-00-721153-1}}).<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20080521073254/http://www.harpercollinschildrensbooks.co.uk/books/default.aspx?id=33175</ref>\n\nThe critically acclaimed [[BBC Radio 4]] [[drama]]tisation was produced between 1988 and 1997, starring [[Maurice Denham]] as Professor Kirke. Collectively titled ''Tales of Narnia'' it covers the entire series and is approximately 15 hours long.  The series was released in Great Britain on both audio cassette and CD by BBC Audiobooks. In 2014, the whole series was released (in the ''author's preferred order''<ref>Note: The author's preferred order is different to the order of publication. See: https://www.narniaweb.com/books/readingorder/</ref>) as a single audio book on [[Audible (store)|Audible]] titled ''The Complete Chronicles of Narnia'' by BBC Worldwide with a total runtime of 15 hours 11 minutes.<ref>https://mobile.audible.co.uk/pd/The-Complete-Chronicles-of-Narnia-Audiobook/B00O3J63EG?qid=1536378491&sr=sr_1_1&ref=a_search_c3_lProduct_1_1&pf_rd_p=c6e316b8-14da-418d-8f91-b3cad83c5183&pf_rd_r=7PERXGHGH8Z64CYG1N51&</ref>\n\nBetween 1999 and 2002 [[Focus on the Family]] produced radio dramatisations of all 7 books through its Radio Theatre program. The production included a cast of over a hundred actors (including [[Paul Scofield]] as \"The Storyteller\" and [[David Suchet]] as \"Aslan\"), an original [[orchestra]]l score and cinema-quality [[Digital audio|digital sound]] design.  The total running time is slightly over 22 hours. Douglas Gresham, the stepson of C. S. Lewis, hosts the series.\n\nThe Focus on the Family version was broadcast on the BBC in the mid-2000s. Currently, the BBC distributes both their own original Radio 4 version and the \"Focus on the Family\" version, the former under the banner \"BBC Radio Presents\" and the latter under the banner \"BBC Radio Theatre\". In the United States, the former is available only on audio cassette and the latter is distributed on CD.\n\n==Stage==\nA licensed musical stage adaptation of ''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'' made its world premiere in 1983 by [[Northwestern College (Minnesota)]] at the Totino Fine Arts Center. Script adaptation by Wayne Olson, with original music score by Kevin Norberg.\n\nIn 1984, ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' was presented at London's Westminster Theatre, produced by [[Vanessa Ford Productions]]. The play, adapted by Glyn Robbins, was directed by [[Richard Williams (theatre director)|Richard Williams]] and designed by Marty Flood; and was revived at Westminster and The Royalty Theatre and on tour until 1997. Productions of other ''Narnian'' tales were also presented, including ''The Voyage of the Dawn Treader'' (1986), ''The Magician's Nephew'' (1988) and ''The Horse and His Boy'' (1990). Robbins's adaptations of the Narnian chronicles are available for production in the UK through Samuel French London.<ref>{{cite book |title=C. S.

The novel was adapted for the stage by Adrian Mitchell, with music by Shaun Davey. The musical was originally directed by Adrian Noble and designed by Anthony Ward, with the revival directed by Lucy Pitman-Wallace. The production was well received and ran during the holiday season from 1998 to 2002, at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford. The production also subsequently transferred to play limited engagements in London at the Barbican Theatre, and at Sadler's Wells. The ''London Evening Standard'' wrote:\n\n{{quote |...Lucy Pitman-Wallace's beautiful recreation of Adrian Noble's production evokes all the awe and mystery of this mythically complex tale, while never being too snooty to stoop to bracingly comic touches like outrageously camp reindeer or a beaver with a housework addiction...

S.

It was directed by [[Andrew Adamson]], with a screenplay by Ann Peacock. [[Principal photography]] for the film took place in Poland, the [[Czech Republic]] and New Zealand. Major Visual Effects Studios like [[Rhythm and Hues Studios]], [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]], [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) and many more worked on the [[Special effect|VFX]] for the movie. The movie achieved critical and [[box-office]] success, reaching the Top 25 of all films released to that time (by revenue).\n\nDisney and Walden Media then co-produced a sequel, ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian]]'', released in May 2008 and grossed over $419 million worldwide.  At the time of ''Caspian'''s release, Disney was already in pre-production on the next chapter, ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader]].''

The first two released volumes, ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'' and ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]],'' which had two CDs or cassettes each, with each successive volume getting 3 CDs. They were released in association with The C.S. Lewis Company, with an introduction by [[Douglas Gresham]]. They used a cast of over one hundred actors, an original orchestral score, and digital sound design. The stars of the cast were [[Paul Scofield]] as the storyteller, [[David Suchet]] as Aslan, [[Elizabeth Counsell]] as the White Witch and Richard Suchet as Caspian X.\n\n==Music==\nA musical retelling of ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe'' in a full-album song-cycle entitled ''[[The Roar of Love]]'' was released in 1980 by the contemporary Christian music group [[2nd Chapter of Acts]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Raised by wolves: the story of Christian rock & roll |last=Thompson |first=John Joseph |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2000 |publisher=ECW Press |location= |isbn= |page=[https://archive.org/details/raisedbywolvesst0000thom/page/64 64] |url=https://archive.org/details/raisedbywolvesst0000thom|url-access=registration |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThe track \"The Chronicles\" from the 2006 album [[The Twilight Chronicles]], by the English Melodic Hard Rock band [[Ten (band)|Ten]] recounts the tale of ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe''.\n\n==Games==\nIn 1984, Word Publishing released ''Adventures in Narnia'', a game developed by Lifeware.

In the majority of areas, the area code still corresponds to the original STD letter code.  When dialling from abroad, the 0 prefix is not dialled. When dialling within the same area, the area code is not needed, save for a handful of areas that do require this. When calling from a mobile telephone, the area code is always needed.\n\n==Code prefixes==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Initial digits\n! scope=\"col\" | Service type\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 00\n| International dialling\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 01393828426\n| Geographic area codes since 1995\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 02\n| Geographic area codes since 2000\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 03\n| [[UK-wide numbers|Non-geographic numbers]] charged at geographic rates\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 04\n| Reserved\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 05\n| Corporate numbering and [[VoIP]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 06\n| Reserved\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 07\n| Mobile phones, [[pagers]] and [[personal numbering]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 08\n| [[Toll-free telephone number|Freephone]] and revenue share [[Non-geographic telephone numbers in the United Kingdom#History of non-geographic prefixes|non-geographic numbers]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 09\n| [[Premium-rate telephone number|Premium-rate services]]\n|}\n\n==List of dialling codes==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\" | Short codes\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:33%;\"| 02x [eight-digit local number]\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:33%;\"| 011x [seven-digit local number]\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:33%;\"| 01x1 [seven-digit local number]\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:33%;\"| 020 to 029\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:33%;\"| 0113 to 0118\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:33%;\"| 0121 to 0191\n|-\n| style=\"width:5%;\"| [[020]] || [[London]]<ref group=\"notes\" name=\"London\">(020) The codes [[0207 & 0208]] '''do not exist''': London is under a single code, '''[[020]]'''.

In the majority of areas, the area code still corresponds to the original STD letter code.  When dialling from abroad, the 0 prefix is not dialled.
