From the age of 16, she was mainly resident in England, where she was sent for her education. She is best known for her novel ''[[Wide Sargasso Sea]]'' (1966), written as a [[prequel]] to [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Modjeska |first=Drusilla  |title=Stravinsky's Lunch |publisher=Picador |year=1999 |location=Sydney |isbn=0-330-36259-3}}</ref> In 1978 she was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire]] for her writing.\n\n==Early life==\nRhys was born in [[Roseau]], the capital of [[Dominica]], one of the [[British Leeward Islands]]. Her father, William Rees Williams, was a Welsh doctor and her mother, Minna Williams, n\u00e9e Lockhart, was a third-generation Dominican [[Creole peoples#Caribbean|Creole]] of Scots ancestry. (\"Creole\" was broadly used in those times to refer to any person born on the island, whether they were of European or African descent, or both.) She had a brother. Her mother's family had an estate, a former plantation, on the island.\n\nRhys was educated in Dominica until the age of 16, when she was sent to England to live with an aunt, as her relations with her mother were difficult. She attended the [[Perse School for Girls]] in Cambridge,<ref name=\"carr\" /> where she was mocked as an outsider and for her accent. She attended two terms at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] in London by 1909. Her instructors despaired of her ever learning to speak \"proper English\" and advised her father to take her away. Unable to train as an actress and refusing to return to the Caribbean as her parents wished, Williams worked with varied success as a [[chorus girl]], adopting the names Vivienne, Emma or Ella Gray. She toured Britain's small towns and returned to rooming or boarding houses in rundown neighbourhoods of London.<ref name=\"carr\">Carr, Helen (2004). \"Williams, Ella Gwendoline Rees (1890\u20131979),\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\nAfter her father died in 1910, Rhys appeared to have experimented with living as a [[demimonde|demimondaine]]. She became the mistress of wealthy stockbroker Lancelot Grey Hugh Smith, whose father [[Hugh Colin Smith]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://genealogy.links.org/links-cgi/readged?/home/ben/camilla-genealogy/current+c-smith81059+2-2-0-1-0|title=Lancelot Grey Hugh SMITH |website=genealogy.links.org |access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> had been [[Governor of the Bank of England]]. Though a bachelor, Smith did not offer to marry Rhys, and their affair soon ended. However, he continued to be an occasional source of financial help. Distraught by events, including a near-fatal abortion (not Smith's child), Rhys began writing and produced an early version of her novel ''Voyage in the Dark''.<ref name=\"carr\"/> In 1913 she worked for a time in London as a nude model.\n\nDuring the [[First World War]], Rhys served as a volunteer worker in a soldiers' canteen. In 1918 she worked in a pension office.\n\n==Marriage and family==\nIn 1919 Rhys married Willem Johan Marie [[:nl:Jean_Lenglet|(Jean) Lenglet]], a French-Dutch journalist, spy and songwriter. He was the first of her three husbands.<ref name=\"carr\"/> She and Lenglet wandered through Europe. They had two children, a son who died young and a daughter. They divorced in 1933, and her daughter lived mostly with her father.\n\nThe next year Rhys married Leslie Tilden-Smith, an English editor. In 1936 they went briefly to Dominica, the first time Rhys had returned since she had left for school. She found her family estate deteriorating and island conditions less agreeable. Her brother Oscar was living in England, and she took care of some financial affairs for him, making a settlement with an island [[mixed-race]] woman and Oscar's illegitimate children by her.\n\nIn 1937 Rhys began a friendship with novelist [[Eliot Bliss]] (who had taken her first name in honour of two authors she admired). The two women shared Caribbean backgrounds. The correspondence between them survives.<ref>McFarlin Library [http://orgs.utulsa.edu/spcol/?p=2073 Retrieved 17 September 2015.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027074557/http://orgs.utulsa.edu/spcol/?p=2073 |date=27 October 2017 }} Bliss is quoted on their relations in Alexandra Pringle's introduction to the 1984 reissue of Bliss's novel ''Luminous Isle'': \"She used to make me delightful West-Indian suppers, and we used to drink an awful lot. Well, she could hold it, but it used to make me ill, frequently ill. And she had a delightful husband who used to leave us, go out. Well, often he would come home and find us drunk. He once picked her off the floor. And he was furious if he found we'd drunk his wine.\"</ref>\n\nIn 1939 Rhys and Tilden-Smith moved to [[Devon]], where they lived for several years. He died in 1945. In 1947 Rhys married Max Hamer, a solicitor who was a cousin of Tilden-Smith. He was convicted of fraud and imprisoned after their marriage.<ref>[http://readingdetectives.org/kent/2009/10/from-maidstone-prison-to-the-wide-sargasso-sea.html \"Kent: From Maidstone Prison to the Wide Sargasso Sea!\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002910/http://readingdetectives.org/kent/2009/10/from-maidstone-prison-to-the-wide-sargasso-sea.html |date= 3 December 2013}}, Reading Detectives.</ref> He died in 1966.\n\n==Writing career==\nIn 1924 Rhys came under the influence of English writer [[Ford Madox Ford]]. After meeting Ford in Paris, Rhys wrote short stories under his patronage. Ford recognised that her experience as an exile gave Rhys a unique viewpoint, and praised her \"singular instinct for form\". \"Coming from the [[West Indies]], [Ford] declared, 'with a terrifying insight and... passion for stating the case of the underdog, she has let her pen loose on the Left Banks of the Old World'.\"<ref name=\"carr\"/> This he wrote in his preface to her debut short story collection, [[The Left Bank and Other Stories|''The Left Bank and Other Stories'']] (1927).\n\nIt was Ford who suggested she change her name from Ella Williams to Jean Rhys.<ref name=\"Owen, Katie 2000\">Owen, Katie, \"Introduction\", ''Quartet'', Penguin Modern Classics edition, Penguin, 2000, p. vi. {{ISBN|978-0-14-118392-3}}</ref> At the time her husband was in jail for what Rhys described as currency irregularities.\n\nRhys moved in with Ford and his long-time partner, [[Stella Bowen]]. An affair with Ford ensued, which she portrayed in fictionalised form in her novel ''[[Quartet (Jean Rhys novel)|Quartet]]'' (1928)<ref name=\"Owen, Katie 2000\" /> Her protagonist is a stranded foreigner, Marya Zelli, who finds herself at the mercy of strangers when her husband is jailed in Paris. ''Quartet's'' 1981 [[Merchant Ivory Productions|Merchant Ivory film]] adaptation starred [[Maggie Smith]], [[Isabelle Adjani]], [[Anthony Higgins (actor)|Anthony Higgins]], and [[Alan Bates]]. \n\nIn ''[[After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie]]'' (1931), the protagonist, Julia Martin, is a more unravelled version of Marya Zelli, romantically dumped and inhabiting the sidewalks, cafes and cheap hotel rooms of Paris.\n\nWith ''[[Voyage in the Dark]]'' (1934), Rhys continued to portray a mistreated, rootless woman. Here the narrator, Anna, is a young chorus girl who grew up in the West Indies and feels alienated in England. \n\n''[[Good Morning, Midnight (Rhys novel)|Good Morning, Midnight]]'' (1939) is often considered a continuation of Rhys's first two novels. Here she uses modified [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] to voice the experiences of an ageing woman, Sasha Jansen, who drinks, takes sleeping pills and obsesses over her looks, and is adrift again in Paris. ''Good Morning, Midnight'', acknowledged as well written but deemed depressing, came as [[World War II]] broke out and readers sought optimism. This seemingly ended Rhys's literary career. \n\nIn the 1940s Rhys largely withdrew from public life. From 1955 to 1960 she lived in [[Bude]], Cornwall, where she was unhappy, calling it \"Bude the Obscure\", before moving to [[Cheriton Fitzpaine]] in Devon.\n\nAfter a long absence from the public eye she was rediscovered by [[Selma Vaz Dias]], who in 1949 placed an advertisement in the [[New Statesman]] asking about her whereabouts, with a view to obtaining the rights to adapt her novel ''Good Morning Midnight'' for radio. Rhys responded, and thereafter developed a long-lasting and collaborative friendship with Vaz Dias, who encouraged her to start writing again. This encouragement ultimately led to the publication in 1966 of her critically acclaimed novel ''[[Wide Sargasso Sea]]''. She intended it as an account of the woman whom Rochester married and kept in his attic in ''[[Jane Eyre]]''. Begun well before she settled in Bude, the book won the notable [[WH Smith Literary Award]] in 1967. She returned to themes of dominance and dependence, especially in marriage, depicting the mutually painful relationship between a privileged English man and a Creole woman from Dominica made powerless on being duped and coerced by him and others. Both the man and the woman enter marriage under mistaken assumptions about the other partner. Her female lead marries Mr Rochester and deteriorates in England as the \"madwoman in the attic\". Rhys portrays this woman from a quite different perspective from the one in ''Jane Eyre''. [[Diana Athill]] of [[Andr\u00e9 Deutsch]] gambled on publishing ''Wide Sargasso Sea''. She and the writer [[Francis Wyndham (Writer)|Francis Wyndham]] helped to revive interest in Rhys's work.<ref name=Penguin>Preliminary page in Jean Rhys, ''Quartet'', Penguin: 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-14-118392-3}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968 [[Andr\u00e9 Deutsch]] published a collection of Rhys's short stories, ''[[Tigers Are Better-Looking]]'', of which eight were written during her 1950s period of obscurity and nine republished from her 1927 collection ''[[The Left Bank and Other Stories]]''. In 1976 [[Andr\u00e9 Deutsch]] published another collection of her short stories, ''[[Sleep It Off Lady]]'', consisting of 16 pieces from an approximately 75-year period, starting from the end of the 19th century.\n\n==Later years==\nFrom 1960, and for the rest of her life, Rhys lived in [[Cheriton Fitzpaine]], a small village in Devon that she once described as \"a dull spot which even drink can't enliven much.\"<ref>[http://www.exeterexpressandecho.co.uk/Villagers-reject-dull-spot-jibe/story-11826347-detail/story.html \"Villagers Reject 'Dull Spot' Jibe\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121084752/http://www.exeterexpressandecho.co.uk/Villagers-reject-dull-spot-jibe/story-11826347-detail/story.html |date=21 November 2015}}, ''Exeter Express & Echo'', 11 February 2010.</ref> Characteristically, she remained unimpressed by her belated ascent to literary fame, commenting, \"It has come too late.\"<ref name=Penguin /> In an interview shortly before her death she questioned whether any novelist, not least herself, could ever be happy for any length of time: \"If I could choose I would rather be happy than write... if I could live my life all over again, and choose....\"<ref>''In Their Own Words: British Novelists.

From the age of 16, she was mainly resident in England, where she was sent for her education. She is best known for her novel ''[[Wide Sargasso Sea]]'' (1966), written as a [[prequel]] to [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]]'s ''[[Jane Eyre]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Modjeska |first=Drusilla  |title=Stravinsky's Lunch |publisher=Picador |year=1999 |location=Sydney |isbn=0-330-36259-3}}</ref> In 1978 she was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire]] for her writing.\n\n==Early life==\nRhys was born in [[Roseau]], the capital of [[Dominica]], one of the [[British Leeward Islands]]. Her father, William Rees Williams, was a Welsh doctor and her mother, Minna Williams, n\u00e9e Lockhart, was a third-generation Dominican [[Creole peoples#Caribbean|Creole]] of Scots ancestry. (\"Creole\" was broadly used in those times to refer to any person born on the island, whether they were of European or African descent, or both.) She had a brother. Her mother's family had an estate, a former plantation, on the island.\n\nRhys was educated in Dominica until the age of 16, when she was sent to England to live with an aunt, as her relations with her mother were difficult. She attended the [[Perse School for Girls]] in Cambridge,<ref name=\"carr\" /> where she was mocked as an outsider and for her accent. She attended two terms at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] in London by 1909. Her instructors despaired of her ever learning to speak \"proper English\" and advised her father to take her away. Unable to train as an actress and refusing to return to the Caribbean as her parents wished, Williams worked with varied success as a [[chorus girl]], adopting the names Vivienne, Emma or Ella Gray. She toured Britain's small towns and returned to rooming or boarding houses in rundown neighbourhoods of London.<ref name=\"carr\">Carr, Helen (2004). \"Williams, Ella Gwendoline Rees (1890\u20131979),\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\nAfter her father died in 1910, Rhys appeared to have experimented with living as a [[demimonde|demimondaine]]. She became the mistress of wealthy stockbroker Lancelot Grey Hugh Smith, whose father [[Hugh Colin Smith]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://genealogy.links.org/links-cgi/readged?/home/ben/camilla-genealogy/current+c-smith81059+2-2-0-1-0|title=Lancelot Grey Hugh SMITH |website=genealogy.links.org |access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> had been [[Governor of the Bank of England]]. Though a bachelor, Smith did not offer to marry Rhys, and their affair soon ended. However, he continued to be an occasional source of financial help. Distraught by events, including a near-fatal abortion (not Smith's child), Rhys began writing and produced an early version of her novel ''Voyage in the Dark''.<ref name=\"carr\"/> In 1913 she worked for a time in London as a nude model.\n\nDuring the [[First World War]], Rhys served as a volunteer worker in a soldiers' canteen. In 1918 she worked in a pension office.\n\n==Marriage and family==\nIn 1919 Rhys married Willem Johan Marie (Jean) Lenglet, a French-Dutch journalist, spy and songwriter. He was the first of her three husbands.<ref name=\"carr\"/> She and Lenglet wandered through Europe. They had two children, a son who died young and a daughter. They divorced in 1933, and her daughter lived mostly with her father.\n\nThe next year Rhys married Leslie Tilden-Smith, an English editor. In 1936 they went briefly to Dominica, the first time Rhys had returned since she had left for school. She found her family estate deteriorating and island conditions less agreeable. Her brother Oscar was living in England, and she took care of some financial affairs for him, making a settlement with an island [[mixed-race]] woman and Oscar's illegitimate children by her.\n\nIn 1937 Rhys began a friendship with novelist [[Eliot Bliss]] (who had taken her first name in honour of two authors she admired). The two women shared Caribbean backgrounds. The correspondence between them survives.<ref>McFarlin Library [http://orgs.utulsa.edu/spcol/?p=2073 Retrieved 17 September 2015.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027074557/http://orgs.utulsa.edu/spcol/?p=2073 |date=27 October 2017 }} Bliss is quoted on their relations in Alexandra Pringle's introduction to the 1984 reissue of Bliss's novel ''Luminous Isle'': \"She used to make me delightful West-Indian suppers, and we used to drink an awful lot. Well, she could hold it, but it used to make me ill, frequently ill. And she had a delightful husband who used to leave us, go out. Well, often he would come home and find us drunk. He once picked her off the floor. And he was furious if he found we'd drunk his wine.\"</ref>\n\nIn 1939 Rhys and Tilden-Smith moved to [[Devon]], where they lived for several years. He died in 1945. In 1947 Rhys married Max Hamer, a solicitor who was a cousin of Tilden-Smith. He was convicted of fraud and imprisoned after their marriage.<ref>[http://readingdetectives.org/kent/2009/10/from-maidstone-prison-to-the-wide-sargasso-sea.html \"Kent: From Maidstone Prison to the Wide Sargasso Sea!\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002910/http://readingdetectives.org/kent/2009/10/from-maidstone-prison-to-the-wide-sargasso-sea.html |date= 3 December 2013}}, Reading Detectives.</ref> He died in 1966.\n\n==Writing career==\nIn 1924 Rhys came under the influence of English writer [[Ford Madox Ford]]. After meeting Ford in Paris, Rhys wrote short stories under his patronage. Ford recognised that her experience as an exile gave Rhys a unique viewpoint, and praised her \"singular instinct for form\". \"Coming from the [[West Indies]], [Ford] declared, 'with a terrifying insight and... passion for stating the case of the underdog, she has let her pen loose on the Left Banks of the Old World'.\"<ref name=\"carr\"/> This he wrote in his preface to her debut short story collection, [[The Left Bank and Other Stories|''The Left Bank and Other Stories'']] (1927).\n\nIt was Ford who suggested she change her name from Ella Williams to Jean Rhys.<ref name=\"Owen, Katie 2000\">Owen, Katie, \"Introduction\", ''Quartet'', Penguin Modern Classics edition, Penguin, 2000, p. vi. {{ISBN|978-0-14-118392-3}}</ref> At the time her husband was in jail for what Rhys described as currency irregularities.\n\nRhys moved in with Ford and his long-time partner, [[Stella Bowen]]. An affair with Ford ensued, which she portrayed in fictionalised form in her novel ''[[Quartet (Jean Rhys novel)|Quartet]]'' (1928)<ref name=\"Owen, Katie 2000\" /> Her protagonist is a stranded foreigner, Marya Zelli, who finds herself at the mercy of strangers when her husband is jailed in Paris. ''Quartet's'' 1981 [[Merchant Ivory Productions|Merchant Ivory film]] adaptation starred [[Maggie Smith]], [[Isabelle Adjani]], [[Anthony Higgins (actor)|Anthony Higgins]], and [[Alan Bates]]. \n\nIn ''[[After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie]]'' (1931), the protagonist, Julia Martin, is a more unravelled version of Marya Zelli, romantically dumped and inhabiting the sidewalks, cafes and cheap hotel rooms of Paris.\n\nWith ''[[Voyage in the Dark]]'' (1934), Rhys continued to portray a mistreated, rootless woman. Here the narrator, Anna, is a young chorus girl who grew up in the West Indies and feels alienated in England. \n\n''[[Good Morning, Midnight (Rhys novel)|Good Morning, Midnight]]'' (1939) is often considered a continuation of Rhys's first two novels. Here she uses modified [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] to voice the experiences of an ageing woman, Sasha Jansen, who drinks, takes sleeping pills and obsesses over her looks, and is adrift again in Paris. ''Good Morning, Midnight'', acknowledged as well written but deemed depressing, came as [[World War II]] broke out and readers sought optimism. This seemingly ended Rhys's literary career. \n\nIn the 1940s Rhys largely withdrew from public life. From 1955 to 1960 she lived in [[Bude]], Cornwall, where she was unhappy, calling it \"Bude the Obscure\", before moving to [[Cheriton Fitzpaine]] in Devon.\n\nAfter a long absence from the public eye she was rediscovered by [[Selma Vaz Dias]], who in 1949 placed an advertisement in the [[New Statesman]] asking about her whereabouts, with a view to obtaining the rights to adapt her novel ''Good Morning Midnight'' for radio. Rhys responded, and thereafter developed a long-lasting and collaborative friendship with Vaz Dias, who encouraged her to start writing again. This encouragement ultimately led to the publication in 1966 of her critically acclaimed novel ''[[Wide Sargasso Sea]]''. She intended it as an account of the woman whom Rochester married and kept in his attic in ''[[Jane Eyre]]''. Begun well before she settled in Bude, the book won the notable [[WH Smith Literary Award]] in 1967. She returned to themes of dominance and dependence, especially in marriage, depicting the mutually painful relationship between a privileged English man and a Creole woman from Dominica made powerless on being duped and coerced by him and others. Both the man and the woman enter marriage under mistaken assumptions about the other partner. Her female lead marries Mr Rochester and deteriorates in England as the \"madwoman in the attic\". Rhys portrays this woman from a quite different perspective from the one in ''Jane Eyre''. [[Diana Athill]] of [[Andr\u00e9 Deutsch]] gambled on publishing ''Wide Sargasso Sea''. She and the writer [[Francis Wyndham (Writer)|Francis Wyndham]] helped to revive interest in Rhys's work.<ref name=Penguin>Preliminary page in Jean Rhys, ''Quartet'', Penguin: 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-14-118392-3}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968 [[Andr\u00e9 Deutsch]] published a collection of Rhys's short stories, ''[[Tigers Are Better-Looking]]'', of which eight were written during her 1950s period of obscurity and nine republished from her 1927 collection ''[[The Left Bank and Other Stories]]''. In 1976 [[Andr\u00e9 Deutsch]] published another collection of her short stories, ''[[Sleep It Off Lady]]'', consisting of 16 pieces from an approximately 75-year period, starting from the end of the 19th century.\n\n==Later years==\nFrom 1960, and for the rest of her life, Rhys lived in [[Cheriton Fitzpaine]], a small village in Devon that she once described as \"a dull spot which even drink can't enliven much.\"<ref>[http://www.exeterexpressandecho.co.uk/Villagers-reject-dull-spot-jibe/story-11826347-detail/story.html \"Villagers Reject 'Dull Spot' Jibe\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121084752/http://www.exeterexpressandecho.co.uk/Villagers-reject-dull-spot-jibe/story-11826347-detail/story.html |date=21 November 2015}}, ''Exeter Express & Echo'', 11 February 2010.</ref> Characteristically, she remained unimpressed by her belated ascent to literary fame, commenting, \"It has come too late.\"<ref name=Penguin /> In an interview shortly before her death she questioned whether any novelist, not least herself, could ever be happy for any length of time: \"If I could choose I would rather be happy than write... if I could live my life all over again, and choose....\"<ref>''In Their Own Words: British Novelists.
