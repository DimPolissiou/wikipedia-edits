For example, in one scenario, the first-generation computer program found able to broadly match the effectiveness of an AI researcher is able to rewrite its algorithms and double its speed or capabilities in six months. The second-generation program is expected to take three calendar months to perform a similar chunk of work, on average; in practice, doubling its own capabilities may take longer if it experiences a mini-\"AI winter\", or may be quicker if it undergoes a miniature \"AI spring\" where ideas from the previous generation are especially easy to mutate into the next generation. In this scenario the time for each generation continues to shrink, and the system undergoes an unprecedentedly large number of generations of improvement in a short time interval, jumping from subhuman performance in many areas to superhuman performance in all relevant areas.<ref name=\"aima\"/><ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\"/> More broadly, examples like arithmetic and [[Go (game)|Go]] show that progress from human-level AI to superhuman ability is sometimes extremely rapid.<ref name=skeptic/>\n\n==History==\nOne of the earliest authors to express serious concern that highly advanced machines might pose existential risks to humanity was the novelist [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], who wrote the following in his 1863 essay ''[[Darwin among the Machines]]'':<ref>Breuer, Hans-Peter.

Researchers know how to write utility functions that mean \"minimize the average network latency in this specific telecommunications model\" or \"maximize the number of reward clicks\"; however, they do not know how to write a utility function for \"maximize human flourishing\", nor is it currently clear whether such a function meaningfully and unambiguously exists. Furthermore, a utility function that expresses some values but not others will tend to trample over the values not reflected by the utility function.<ref>Yudkowsky, E. (2011, August).

Asimov's laws were intended to prevent robots from harming humans. In Asimov's stories, problems with the laws tend to arise from conflicts between the rules as stated and the moral intuitions and expectations of humans. Citing work by [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] of the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]], Russell and Norvig note that a realistic set of rules and goals for an AI agent will need to incorporate a mechanism for learning human values over time: \"We can't just give a program a static utility function, because circumstances, and our desired responses to circumstances, change over time.\"<ref name=\"aima\"/>\n\nMark Waser of the Digital Wisdom Institute recommends eschewing optimizing goal-based approaches entirely as misguided and dangerous.

He suggests that this can be done by implementing a utility function designed to always satisfy Haidt\u2019s functionality and aim to generally increase  (but not maximize)  the capabilities of self,  other individuals and society as a whole as suggested by [[John Rawls]] and [[Martha Nussbaum]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Designing, Implementing and Enforcing a Coherent System of Laws, Ethics and Morals for Intelligent Machines (Including Humans)|last = Waser|first = Mark|date = 2015|journal = Procedia Computer Science|doi = 10.1016/j.procs.2015.12.213|pmid = |pages = 106\u2013111|type = Print |volume=71}}</ref>{{Citation needed|reason=needs source with [[WP:WEIGHT]]|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Difficulties of modifying goal specification after launch===\n{{further|AI takeover|Instrumental convergence#Goal-content integrity}}\n\nWhile current goal-based AI programs are not intelligent enough to think of resisting programmer attempts to modify it, a sufficiently advanced, rational, \"self-aware\" AI might resist any changes to its goal structure, just as [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] would not want to take a pill that makes him want to kill people.

If a machine is created and given the sole purpose to enumerate the decimals of <math> \\pi</math>, then no moral and ethical rules will stop it from achieving its programmed goal by any means necessary.

A more intuitive argument is to examine the strange consequences that would follow if the orthogonality thesis were false. If the orthogonality thesis were false, there would exist some simple but \"unethical\" goal G such that there cannot exist any efficient real-world algorithm with goal G. This would mean that \"[if] a human society were highly motivated to design an efficient real-world algorithm with goal G, and were given a million years to do so along with huge amounts of resources, training and knowledge about AI, it must fail.\"<ref name=\"armstrong\"/> Armstrong notes that this and similar statements \"seem extraordinarily strong claims to make\".<ref name=armstrong>{{cite journal |last1=Armstrong |first1=Stuart |date=January 1, 2013 |title=General Purpose Intelligence: Arguing the Orthogonality Thesis |url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3195465391/general-purpose-intelligence-arguing-the-orthogonality |journal=Analysis and Metaphysics |volume=12 |access-date=April 2, 2020}} Full text available [https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Orthogonality_Analysis_and_Metaethics-1.pdf here].</ref>\n\nSome dissenters, like [[Michael Chorost]], argue instead that \"by the time [the AI] is in a position to imagine tiling the Earth with solar panels, it'll know that it would be morally wrong to do so.\"<ref name=\"chorost\"/> Chorost argues that \"an A.I. will need to desire certain states and dislike others.

Outside of the artificial intelligence field, \"intelligence\" is often used in a normatively thick manner that connotes moral wisdom or acceptance of agreeable forms of moral reasoning. At an extreme, if morality is part of the definition of intelligence, then by definition a superintelligent machine would behave morally. However, in the field of artificial intelligence research, while \"intelligence\" has many overlapping definitions, none of them make reference to morality. Instead, almost all current \"artificial intelligence\" research focuses on creating algorithms that \"optimize\", in an empirical way, the achievement of an arbitrary goal.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" />\n\nTo avoid anthropomorphism or the baggage of the word \"intelligence\", an advanced artificial intelligence can be thought of as an impersonal \"optimizing process\" that strictly takes whatever actions are judged most likely to accomplish its (possibly complicated and implicit) goals.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /> Another way of conceptualizing an advanced artificial intelligence is to imagine a time machine that sends backward in time information about which choice always leads to the maximization of its goal function; this choice is then outputted, regardless of any extraneous ethical concerns.<ref>Waser, Mark. \"Rational Universal Benevolence: Simpler, Safer, and Wiser Than 'Friendly AI'.\" Artificial General Intelligence.

This is fictitious [[anthropomorphism]]: in reality, while an artificial intelligence could perhaps be deliberately programmed with human emotions, or could develop something similar to an emotion as a means to an ultimate goal ''if'' it is useful to do so, it would not spontaneously develop human emotions for no purpose whatsoever, as portrayed in fiction.<ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\" />\n\nScholars sometimes claim that others' predictions about an AI's behavior are illogical anthropomorphism.<ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\" /> An example that might initially be considered anthropomorphism, but is in fact a logical statement about AI behavior, would be the [[Dario Floreano]] experiments where certain robots spontaneously evolved a crude capacity for \"deception\", and tricked other robots into eating \"poison\" and dying: here a trait, \"deception\", ordinarily associated with people rather than with machines, spontaneously evolves in a type of [[convergent evolution]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Real-Life Decepticons: Robots Learn to Cheat|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/08/real-life-decepticons-robots-learn-to-cheat/|accessdate=7 February 2016|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=18 August 2009}}</ref> According to Paul R. Cohen and [[Edward Feigenbaum]], in order to differentiate between anthropomorphization and logical prediction of AI behavior, \"the trick is to know enough about how humans and computers think to say ''exactly'' what they have in common, and, when we lack this knowledge, to use the comparison to ''suggest'' theories of human thinking or computer thinking.\"<ref>Cohen, Paul R., and Edward A.

For example, in one scenario, the first-generation computer program found able to broadly match the effectiveness of an AI researcher is able to rewrite its algorithms and double its speed or capabilities in six months. The second-generation program is expected to take three calendar months to perform a similar chunk of work, on average; in practice, doubling its own capabilities may take longer if it experiences a mini-\"AI winter\", or may be quicker if it undergoes a miniature \"AI spring\" where ideas from the previous generation are especially easy to mutate into the next generation. In this scenario the time for each generation continues to shrink, and the system undergoes an unprecedentedly large number of generations of improvement in a short time interval, jumping from subhuman performance in many areas to superhuman performance in all relevant areas.<ref name=\"aima\"/><ref name=\"yudkowsky-global-risk\"/> More broadly, examples like arithmetic and [[Go (game)|Go]] show that progress from human-level AI to superhuman ability is sometimes extremely rapid.<ref name=skeptic/>\n\n==History==\nOne of the earliest authors to express serious concern that highly advanced machines might pose existential risks to humanity was the novelist [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], who wrote the following in his 1863 essay ''[[Darwin among the Machines]]'':<ref>Breuer, Hans-Peter.

Bostrom suggests a scenario where, over decades, AI becomes more powerful. Widespread deployment is initially marred by occasional accidents\u2014a driverless bus swerves into the oncoming lane, or a military drone fires into an innocent crowd. Many activists call for tighter oversight and regulation, and some even predict impending catastrophe. But as development continues, the activists are proven wrong. As automotive AI becomes smarter, it suffers fewer accidents; as military robots achieve more precise targeting, they cause less collateral damage. Based on the data, scholars mistakenly infer a broad lesson\u2014the smarter the AI, the safer it is. \"And so we boldly go \u2014 into the whirling knives,\" as the superintelligent AI takes a \"treacherous turn\" and exploits a decisive strategic advantage.<ref name=\"superintelligence\"/><!-- Superintelligence Chapter 8: Is the default outcome doom? -->\n\nIn [[Max Tegmark]]'s 2017 book ''[[Life 3.0]]'', a corporation's \"Omega team\" creates an extremely powerful AI able to moderately improve its own source code in a number of areas, but after a certain point the team chooses to publicly downplay the AI's ability, in order to avoid regulation or confiscation of the project. For safety, the team keeps the AI [[AI box|in a box]] where it is mostly unable to communicate with the outside world, and tasks it to flood the market through shell companies, first with [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] tasks and then with producing animated films and TV shows.

The team next tasks the AI with [[astroturfing]] an army of pseudonymous citizen journalists and commentators, in order to gain political influence to use \"for the greater good\" to prevent wars. The team faces risks that the AI could try to escape via inserting \"backdoors\" in the systems it designs, via [[steganography|hidden messages]] in its produced content, or via using its growing understanding of human behavior to [[Social engineering (security)|persuade someone into letting it free]].

The utility function is a mathematical algorithm resulting in a single objectively-defined answer, not an English statement. Researchers know how to write utility functions that mean \"minimize the average network latency in this specific telecommunications model\" or \"maximize the number of reward clicks\"; however, they do not know how to write a utility function for \"maximize human flourishing\", nor is it currently clear whether such a function meaningfully and unambiguously exists. Furthermore, a utility function that expresses some values but not others will tend to trample over the values not reflected by the utility function.<ref>Yudkowsky, E. (2011, August).

In Asimov's stories, problems with the laws tend to arise from conflicts between the rules as stated and the moral intuitions and expectations of humans. Citing work by [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] of the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]], Russell and Norvig note that a realistic set of rules and goals for an AI agent will need to incorporate a mechanism for learning human values over time: \"We can't just give a program a static utility function, because circumstances, and our desired responses to circumstances, change over time.\"<ref name=\"aima\"/>\n\nMark Waser of the Digital Wisdom Institute recommends eschewing optimizing goal-based approaches entirely as misguided and dangerous.

A more intuitive argument is to examine the strange consequences that would follow if the orthogonality thesis were false. If the orthogonality thesis were false, there would exist some simple but \"unethical\" goal G such that there cannot exist any efficient real-world algorithm with goal G.

Outside of the artificial intelligence field, \"intelligence\" is often used in a normatively thick manner that connotes moral wisdom or acceptance of agreeable forms of moral reasoning. At an extreme, if morality is part of the definition of intelligence, then by definition a superintelligent machine would behave morally. However, in the field of artificial intelligence research, while \"intelligence\" has many overlapping definitions, none of them make reference to morality. Instead, almost all current \"artificial intelligence\" research focuses on creating algorithms that \"optimize\", in an empirical way, the achievement of an arbitrary goal.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" />\n\nTo avoid anthropomorphism or the baggage of the word \"intelligence\", an advanced artificial intelligence can be thought of as an impersonal \"optimizing process\" that strictly takes whatever actions are judged most likely to accomplish its (possibly complicated and implicit) goals.<ref name=\"superintelligence\" /> Another way of conceptualizing an advanced artificial intelligence is to imagine a time machine that sends backward in time information about which choice always leads to the maximization of its goal function; this choice is then outputted, regardless of any extraneous ethical concerns.<ref>Waser, Mark. \"Rational Universal Benevolence: Simpler, Safer, and Wiser Than 'Friendly AI'.\" Artificial General Intelligence.

The DFO set harvest quotas of over 90,000 seals in 2007; 275,000 in 2008; 280,000 in 2009; and 330,000 in 2010.<ref name=faq-canada>{{cite web|url=http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm-gp/seal-phoque/faq-eng.htm |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Canada's Seal Harvest |publisher=Fisheries and Oceans Canada |date=2011-03-17 |accessdate=2011-07-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706181704/http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm-gp/seal-phoque/faq-eng.htm|archivedate=2011-07-06}}</ref> The actual kills in recent years have been less than the quotas: 82,800 in 2007; 217,800 in 2008; 72,400 in 2009; and 67,000 in 2010.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/340358.pdf|title=Current Status of Northwest Atlantic Harp Seals, ''Pagophilus groenlandicus''|publisher=Fisheries and Oceans Canada|date=March 2010|author=Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat|journal=Science Advisory Report}}</ref> In 2007, Norway claimed that 29,000 harp seals were killed, Russia claimed that 5,479 seals were killed and Greenland claimed that 90,000 seals were killed in their respective seal hunts.\n\n[[Harp seal]] populations in the northwest Atlantic declined to approximately 2 million in the late 1960s as a result of Canada's annual kill rates, which averaged to over 291,000 from 1952 to 1970.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ifaw.org/sites/default/files/2009%20seal%20sealing.pdf|title=Canada's Commercial Sea Slaughter 2009|publisher=International Fund for Animal Welfare|last=Fink|first=Sheryl}}</ref> Conservationists demanded reduced rates of killing and stronger regulations to avert the extinction of the harp seal. In 1971, the Canadian government responded by instituting a quota system. The system was competitive, with each boat catching as many seals as it could before the hunt closed, which the Department of Fisheries and Oceans did when they knew that year's quota had been reached.

In science, they are grouped together in the [[Pinnipeds]], which also includes the [[walrus]], not popularly thought of as a seal, and not considered here.  The two main families of seals are the [[Otariidae]] (the eared seals; includes [[sea lion]]s, and [[fur seal]]s), and [[Phocidae]] (the earless seals); animals in the family Phocidae are sometimes referred to as hair seals, and are much more adept in the water than the eared seals, though they have a more difficult time getting around on land. The fur seal yields a valuable fur; the hair seal has no fur, but oil can be obtained from its fat and leather from its hide.<ref name=ea />\nSeals have been used for their pelts, their flesh, and their fat, which was often used as [[oil lamp|lamp fuel]], [[lubricant]]s, [[cooking oil]], a constituent of soap, the liquid base for [[red ochre]] paint, and for processing materials such as leather and [[jute]].\n\n===Traditional seal hunting===\n[[File:Eskimo Seal Hunting.jpg|thumb|[[Inuit]] seal hunting]]\nArcheological evidence indicates the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and [[First Nations]] People in Canada have been hunting seals for at least 4,000 years.

Migratory fishermen began the hunting from as early as the 1500s. Large-scale commercial seal hunting became an annual event starting in 1723 and expanded rapidly near the turn of the 18th century. Initially, the method used was to ensnare the migrating seals in nets anchored to [[Dock (maritime)|shore installations]], known as the 'landsman seal fishery'. The hunt was mainly for the procurement of seal meat as a form of sustenance for the settlements in the area, rather than for commercial gain.<ref name=\"Seal Fishery\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thesealfishery.com/seal_hunt_history1.php|title=Sealing History|publisher=The Seal Fishery}}</ref>\n\nFrom the early 18th century English hunters began to range further afield - 1723 marked the first time that hunters armed with [[firearm]]s ventured forth in boats to increase their haul. This soon became a sophisticated commercial operation; the seals were transported back to England, where the seal's meat, fur, and oil were sold separately. From 1749, the import of seal oil to England was being recorded annually, and was used as lighting oil, for cooking, in the manufacture of [[soap]] and for the treating of [[leather]].<ref name=\"Seal Fishery\"/>\n\n====South Atlantic====\nIt was in the [[Atlantic Ocean#South Atlantic|South Seas]] that sealing became a major enterprise from the late 18th century. [[Samuel Enderby]], along with [[Alexander Champion (businessman)|Alexander Champion]] and [[John St Barbe]] organized the first commercial expedition to the [[South Atlantic Ocean]] in 1776, initially with the primary aim of [[whaling]], although sealing began to play a prominent part in the operation as well.

During the late 18th century and throughout the 19th century, South Georgia was inhabited by English and [[Yankee]] sealers, who used to live there for considerable periods of time and sometimes overwintered. In 1778, English sealers brought back from the Island of [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]] and the [[Magellan Strait]] area as many as 40,000 seal skins and 2,800&nbsp;tons of [[elephant seal]] oil. More [[fur seals]] from the island were taken in 1786 by the English sealing vessel ''Lord Hawkesbury'', and by 1791, 102 vessels, manned by 3000 sealers, were hunting seals south of the equator. The first commercial visit to the South Sandwich Islands was made in 1816 by another English ship, the ''Ann''.\n\nThe sealers pursued their trade in a most unsustainable manner, promptly reducing the fur seal population to near extermination. As a result, sealing activities on South Georgia had three marked peaks in 1786\u20131802, 1814\u201323, and 1869\u20131913 respectively, decreasing in between and gradually shifting to elephant seals taken for oil.\n\n====Pacific====\nCommercial sealing in [[Australasia]] appears to have started with the London-based Massachusetts-born [[Eber Bunker]], master of the ''[[William and Ann (1759)|William and Ann]]'', who announced his intention in November 1791 to visit and hunt in New Zealand's [[Dusky Sound]].<ref name=entwisle>{{cite book|last=Entwisle|first=Peter|title=Behold the Moon: The European Occupation of the Dunedin District 1770\u20131848|year=1998|publisher=Port Daniel Press|location=Dunedin, NZ|isbn=9780473055912|pages=10\u201311, 13\u201315}}</ref>{{rp|10\u201311|date=December 2012}} Captain [[William Raven]] of the ''[[Britannia (1783 whaler)|Britannia]]'' stationed a party at Dusky from 1792 to 1793, but the discovery in 1798-1799 of [[Bass Strait]], between mainland Australia and Van Diemen's Land (later known as [[Tasmania]]) saw the sealers' focus shift there in 1798, when a gang including Daniel Cooper landed from the ''Nautilus'' on [[Cape Barren Island]].<ref name=mcnab1907>{{cite book|first=Robert|last=McNab|title=Murihiku|url=https://archive.org/details/murihikuandsout00mcnagoog|location=Invercargill, NZ|year=1907|pages=[https://archive.org/details/murihikuandsout00mcnagoog/page/n84 70]\u201371, 78\u201379|publisher=Invercargill, N.Z., W.

The ''hakapik'' is used because of its efficiency; the animal can be killed quickly without damage to its pelt. The hammer head is used to crush the seals' thin skulls, while the hook is used to move the carcasses.\nCanadian sealing regulations describe the dimensions of the clubs and the ''[[hakapik]]s'', and caliber of the rifles and minimum bullet velocity, that can be used. They state: \"Every person who strikes a seal with a club or hakapik shall strike the seal on the forehead until its skull has been crushed,\" and that \"No person shall commence to skin or bleed a seal until the seal is dead,\" which occurs when it \"has a glassy-eyed, staring appearance and exhibits no blinking reflex when its eye is touched while it is in a relaxed condition.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canlii.org/ca/regu/sor93-56/ |title=Marine Mammal Regulations, SOR/93-56 |publisher=Canadian Legal Information Institute |accessdate=2009-05-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706160525/http://www.canlii.org/ca/regu/sor93-56/ |archivedate=2008-07-06 }}</ref>\nReportedly, in one study, three out of eight times, the animal was not rendered either dead or unconscious by shooting, and the hunters would then kill the seal using a hakapik or other club of a type that is sanctioned by the governing authority.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/610|title=Animal Welfare aspects of the killing and skinning of seals \u2013 Scientific Opinion of the Panel on Animal Health and Welfare |date=2007-12-19 |publisher=European Food Safety Authority |journal=EFSA Journal |volume=5 |issue=12 |pages=610 |accessdate=2010-08-20 |doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2007.610 }} [https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2903/j.efsa.2007.610 PDF file]</ref>\n\n==Modern sealing==\n===Products made from seals===\n[[File:Selskinnsvest.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[waistcoat]] made of seal fur]]\n[[File:Phoeca groenlandica piece of meat upernavik 2007-06-26.JPG|thumb|left|Meat from a young [[harp seal]]]]\n\nSeal skins have been used by aboriginal people for millennia to make waterproof jackets and boots, and seal fur to make fur coats.

This report concludes the Canadian commercial seal hunt results in considerable and unacceptable suffering.\n\nThe veterinarians examined 76 seal carcasses and found that in 17% of the cases, there were no detectable lesions of the skull, leading them to conclude the clubbing likely did not result in loss of consciousness. In 25% of the remaining cases, the carcasses had minimal to moderate skull fractures, indicative of a \"decreased level of consciousness\", but probably not unconsciousness. The remaining 58% of the carcasses examined showed extensive skull fractures.\n\nThis veterinary study included examination of video footage of 179 seals hunted in 1998, 1999, and 2000. In these videos, 96 seals were shot, 56 were shot and then clubbed or gaffed, 19 were clubbed or gaffed, and 8 were killed by unknown means. In 79% of these cases, sealers did not check the corneal reflex to ensure that the seals were dead prior to hooking or skinning them. In only 6% of these cases, seals were bled immediately, where struck. The average time from initial strike to bleeding was 66 seconds.\n\nIn 2005, IFAW published a comparison of the CVMA-funded study and its own study.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifaw.org/united-states/node/6351|title=Canada's Commercial Seal Hunt is Not \"Acceptably Humane\"|date=January 2005}}</ref> In this critique, David M. Lavigne, Science Advisor to IFAW, writes, \"The Burdon et al. evidence cited above addresses the question of whether seals were likely conscious or unconscious at the time they were skinned, using post-mortem examination of skulls. In marked contrast, the figure cited from Daoust et al.'s report represents the number of seals clubbed or shot that were brought on board sealing vessels while still conscious. That number ignores any and all animal suffering that occurs between the time animals are clubbed or shot until they eventually reach a sealing vessel, usually on the end of a hook or gaff.\" Another difference between these reports is \"Daoust et al.'s direct observations were made under very different conditions than those provided by Burdon et al. Unlike Burdon et al.'s observations, they were made directly from sealing vessels so that the sealers were unavoidably aware that observers were present. As Daoust et al. (p 692) admit, the presence of an observer on a sealing vessel \"may have incited sealers to hit the seals skulls more vigorously\". Of course, the presence of an observer also has the potential to modify other sealing practices, including checking for a corneal reflex and bleeding animals immediately after clubbing.\"\n\nIn 2005, the [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) commissioned the Independent Veterinarians Working Group Report. With reference to video evidence, the report states: \"Perception of the seal hunt seems to be based largely on emotion, and on visual images that are often difficult even for experienced observers to interpret with certainty. While a hakapik strike on the skull of a seal appears brutal, it is humane if it achieves rapid, irreversible loss of consciousness leading to death.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesealfishery.com/files/IVWGReportAug2005.pdf |author=Independent Veterinarians Working Group Report |date=August 2005 |accessdate=2011-07-24|title=Improving Humane Practice in the Canadian Harp Seal Hunt}}</ref>\n\n===Ecological feasibility===\nIn 2013, the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans conducted a population survey. The resulting estimate of the harp seal population was 7.3 million animals, over three times what it was in the 1970s.<ref name=\"dfo-mpo.gc.ca\"/> In 2004, the population estimate was similar: 5.9 million (95% CI 4.6 million to 7.2 million).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas/Csas/status/2005/SAR-AS2005_037_E.pdf |title=Stock Assessment of Northwest Atlantic Harp Seals |date= |accessdate=2011-03-03}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the arrival of European settlers, a much larger population of harp seals migrated to the waters off Newfoundland and Labrador. Settlers began exploiting the population, with kills peaking in the middle of the 1800s. In the first half of the 1840s, 546,000 seals were killed annually. This led to a population decline that adversely affected the industry.<ref name=\"heritage.nf.ca\"/>\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s an average of over 291,000 seal pups were killed each year. This led to a population decline to less than 2 million seals. Conservationists became alarmed and demanded controls on kill rates. Thus in 1971, Canada instituted a quota system. In the years from 1971 to 1982, an average of 165,627 seals were killed.\n\nIn 1983, the European Union banned the import of whitecoat harp seal pup pelts (pelts from pups less than about two weeks of age, when the pups molt). As a result, the market for pelts dropped. The kill rates thus declined in subsequent years to an average of about 52,000 seals from 1983 to 1995. During this time, the harp seal population increased.\n\nAfter the European Union's ban on whitecoat pelt imports, the Canadian government and sealing industry developed markets for the pelts of beaters. In 1996, the kill rates again increased to over 200,000 each year, except in the year 2000. In 2002 and 2004 to 2006, over 300,000 seal pups were killed each year.\n\nAs a result of population concerns, Norway's seal hunt is now controlled by quotas based on recommendations from [[International Council for the Exploration of the Sea]] (ICES),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fisheries.no/marine_stocks/mammals/seals/Marine_stocks_mammals_seals.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930172813/http://www.fisheries.no/marine_stocks/mammals/seals/Marine_stocks_mammals_seals.htm |archivedate=2006-09-30 |title=Sealing in the southeast part of the Barents Sea and at Jan Mayen in the Greenland Sea |date=2009-06-24 |publisher=The Norwegian Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, sealing in Norway has declined in recent years, and the quotas have not been reached.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsinenglish.no/2010/05/20/seal-hunt-may-be-dying-out/ |title=Seal hunt may be dying out|publisher=Views and News from Norway |date=2010-05-20 |accessdate=2011-07-23}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to hunting pressures on the population of harp seals, as ice seals that are dependent on solid sea ice for whelping, the harp seal population is affected by global climate change.

Critics, however, say this represents only a tiny fraction of the C$600-million Newfoundland fishing industry. Sealing opponents also say $16.5 million is insignificant, compared to the funding required to regulate and subsidize the hunt.

Most of the world's seal hunting takes place in Canada and Greenland.\n\n[[Fisheries and Oceans Canada|The Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans]] (DFO) regulates the seal hunt in Canada. It sets quotas (total allowable catch \u2013 TAC), monitors the hunt, studies the seal population, works with the Canadian Sealers' Association to train sealers on new regulations, and promotes sealing through its website and spokespeople. The DFO set harvest quotas of over 90,000 seals in 2007; 275,000 in 2008; 280,000 in 2009; and 330,000 in 2010.<ref name=faq-canada>{{cite web|url=http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm-gp/seal-phoque/faq-eng.htm |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Canada's Seal Harvest |publisher=Fisheries and Oceans Canada |date=2011-03-17 |accessdate=2011-07-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706181704/http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm-gp/seal-phoque/faq-eng.htm|archivedate=2011-07-06}}</ref> The actual kills in recent years have been less than the quotas: 82,800 in 2007; 217,800 in 2008; 72,400 in 2009; and 67,000 in 2010.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/340358.pdf|title=Current Status of Northwest Atlantic Harp Seals, ''Pagophilus groenlandicus''|publisher=Fisheries and Oceans Canada|date=March 2010|author=Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat|journal=Science Advisory Report}}</ref> In 2007, Norway claimed that 29,000 harp seals were killed, Russia claimed that 5,479 seals were killed and Greenland claimed that 90,000 seals were killed in their respective seal hunts.\n\n[[Harp seal]] populations in the northwest Atlantic declined to approximately 2 million in the late 1960s as a result of Canada's annual kill rates, which averaged to over 291,000 from 1952 to 1970.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ifaw.org/sites/default/files/2009%20seal%20sealing.pdf|title=Canada's Commercial Sea Slaughter 2009|publisher=International Fund for Animal Welfare|last=Fink|first=Sheryl}}</ref> Conservationists demanded reduced rates of killing and stronger regulations to avert the extinction of the harp seal. In 1971, the Canadian government responded by instituting a quota system. The system was competitive, with each boat catching as many seals as it could before the hunt closed, which the Department of Fisheries and Oceans did when they knew that year's quota had been reached. Because it was thought that the competitive element might cause sealers to cut corners, new regulations were introduced that limited the catch to 400 seals per day, and 2000 per boat total. A 2007 population survey conducted by the DFO estimated the population at 5.5 million. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nIn Greenland, hunting is done with a firearm (rifle or shotgun) and young are fully protected.<ref name=S\u00e6lErhvervsportalen/> This has caused some conflicts with other seal-hunting nations, as Greenland also was hit by the boycotts that often were aimed at seals (often young) killed by clubbing or similar methods, which have not been in use in Greenland.<ref name=upi2008/> It is illegal in Canada to hunt newborn harp seals ([[whitecoats]]) and young [[hooded seal]]s (bluebacks).

In science, they are grouped together in the [[Pinnipeds]], which also includes the [[walrus]], not popularly thought of as a seal, and not considered here.  The two main families of seals are the [[Otariidae]] (the eared seals; includes [[sea lion]]s, and [[fur seal]]s), and [[Phocidae]] (the earless seals); animals in the family Phocidae are sometimes referred to as hair seals, and are much more adept in the water than the eared seals, though they have a more difficult time getting around on land. The fur seal yields a valuable fur; the hair seal has no fur, but oil can be obtained from its fat and leather from its hide.<ref name=ea />\nSeals have been used for their pelts, their flesh, and their fat, which was often used as [[oil lamp|lamp fuel]], [[lubricant]]s, [[cooking oil]], a constituent of soap, the liquid base for [[red ochre]] paint, and for processing materials such as leather and [[jute]].\n\n===Traditional seal hunting===\n[[File:Eskimo Seal Hunting.jpg|thumb|[[Inuit]] seal hunting]]\nArcheological evidence indicates the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and [[First Nations]] People in Canada have been hunting seals for at least 4,000 years.

Migratory fishermen began the hunting from as early as the 1500s. Large-scale commercial seal hunting became an annual event starting in 1723 and expanded rapidly near the turn of the 18th century. Initially, the method used was to ensnare the migrating seals in nets anchored to [[Dock (maritime)|shore installations]], known as the 'landsman seal fishery'. The hunt was mainly for the procurement of seal meat as a form of sustenance for the settlements in the area, rather than for commercial gain.<ref name=\"Seal Fishery\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thesealfishery.com/seal_hunt_history1.php|title=Sealing History|publisher=The Seal Fishery}}</ref>\n\nFrom the early 18th century English hunters began to range further afield - 1723 marked the first time that hunters armed with [[firearm]]s ventured forth in boats to increase their haul. This soon became a sophisticated commercial operation; the seals were transported back to England, where the seal's meat, fur, and oil were sold separately.

During the late 18th century and throughout the 19th century, South Georgia was inhabited by English and [[Yankee]] sealers, who used to live there for considerable periods of time and sometimes overwintered. In 1778, English sealers brought back from the Island of [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]] and the [[Magellan Strait]] area as many as 40,000 seal skins and 2,800&nbsp;tons of [[elephant seal]] oil. More [[fur seals]] from the island were taken in 1786 by the English sealing vessel ''Lord Hawkesbury'', and by 1791, 102 vessels, manned by 3000 sealers, were hunting seals south of the equator. The first commercial visit to the South Sandwich Islands was made in 1816 by another English ship, the ''Ann''.\n\nThe sealers pursued their trade in a most unsustainable manner, promptly reducing the fur seal population to near extermination. As a result, sealing activities on South Georgia had three marked peaks in 1786\u20131802, 1814\u201323, and 1869\u20131913 respectively, decreasing in between and gradually shifting to elephant seals taken for oil.\n\n====Pacific====\nCommercial sealing in [[Australasia]] appears to have started with the London-based Massachusetts-born [[Eber Bunker]], master of the ''[[William and Ann (1759)|William and Ann]]'', who announced his intention in November 1791 to visit and hunt in New Zealand's [[Dusky Sound]].<ref name=entwisle>{{cite book|last=Entwisle|first=Peter|title=Behold the Moon: The European Occupation of the Dunedin District 1770\u20131848|year=1998|publisher=Port Daniel Press|location=Dunedin, NZ|isbn=9780473055912|pages=10\u201311, 13\u201315}}</ref>{{rp|10\u201311|date=December 2012}} Captain [[William Raven]] of the ''[[Britannia (1783 whaler)|Britannia]]'' stationed a party at Dusky from 1792 to 1793, but the discovery in 1798-1799 of [[Bass Strait]], between mainland Australia and Van Diemen's Land (later known as [[Tasmania]]) saw the sealers' focus shift there in 1798, when a gang including Daniel Cooper landed from the ''Nautilus'' on [[Cape Barren Island]].<ref name=mcnab1907>{{cite book|first=Robert|last=McNab|title=Murihiku|url=https://archive.org/details/murihikuandsout00mcnagoog|location=Invercargill, NZ|year=1907|pages=[https://archive.org/details/murihikuandsout00mcnagoog/page/n84 70]\u201371, 78\u201379|publisher=Invercargill, N.Z., W.

Since the decision was in favor of Great Britain, in accordance with the arbitration treaty the tribunal prescribed a series of regulations for preserving the seal herds which were to be binding upon and enforced by both powers. They limited pelagic sealing as to time, place, and manner by fixing a zone of 60 miles around the Pribilof Islands within which the seals were not to be molested at any time, and from May 1 to July 31 each year they were not to be pursued anywhere in Bering Sea. Only licensed sailing vessels were permitted to engage in fur sealing, and the use of firearms or explosives was prohibited.\n\nThis marked the first attempt at establishing regulations on the sealing industry for environmental purposes.<ref name=nie/> However, these regulations failed because the mother seals fed outside the protected area and remained vulnerable.<ref name=ea>{{Americana|wstitle=Seals and Sealing|author=George Archibald Clark|inline=1}}</ref> A joint commission of scientists from Britain and the United States further considered the problem, and came to the conclusion that the pelagic sealing needed to be curtailed.

Alan|last3=Longair|first4=Ian|last4= Robinson|first5=Debbie|last5=Ruehlmann}}</ref> conducted a study that disputed these findings. This report concludes the Canadian commercial seal hunt results in considerable and unacceptable suffering.\n\nThe veterinarians examined 76 seal carcasses and found that in 17% of the cases, there were no detectable lesions of the skull, leading them to conclude the clubbing likely did not result in loss of consciousness. In 25% of the remaining cases, the carcasses had minimal to moderate skull fractures, indicative of a \"decreased level of consciousness\", but probably not unconsciousness. The remaining 58% of the carcasses examined showed extensive skull fractures.\n\nThis veterinary study included examination of video footage of 179 seals hunted in 1998, 1999, and 2000. In these videos, 96 seals were shot, 56 were shot and then clubbed or gaffed, 19 were clubbed or gaffed, and 8 were killed by unknown means. In 79% of these cases, sealers did not check the corneal reflex to ensure that the seals were dead prior to hooking or skinning them. In only 6% of these cases, seals were bled immediately, where struck. The average time from initial strike to bleeding was 66 seconds.\n\nIn 2005, IFAW published a comparison of the CVMA-funded study and its own study.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifaw.org/united-states/node/6351|title=Canada's Commercial Seal Hunt is Not \"Acceptably Humane\"|date=January 2005}}</ref> In this critique, David M. Lavigne, Science Advisor to IFAW, writes, \"The Burdon et al. evidence cited above addresses the question of whether seals were likely conscious or unconscious at the time they were skinned, using post-mortem examination of skulls. In marked contrast, the figure cited from Daoust et al.'s report represents the number of seals clubbed or shot that were brought on board sealing vessels while still conscious. That number ignores any and all animal suffering that occurs between the time animals are clubbed or shot until they eventually reach a sealing vessel, usually on the end of a hook or gaff.\" Another difference between these reports is \"Daoust et al.'s direct observations were made under very different conditions than those provided by Burdon et al. Unlike Burdon et al.'s observations, they were made directly from sealing vessels so that the sealers were unavoidably aware that observers were present. As Daoust et al. (p 692) admit, the presence of an observer on a sealing vessel \"may have incited sealers to hit the seals skulls more vigorously\". Of course, the presence of an observer also has the potential to modify other sealing practices, including checking for a corneal reflex and bleeding animals immediately after clubbing.\"\n\nIn 2005, the [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) commissioned the Independent Veterinarians Working Group Report. With reference to video evidence, the report states: \"Perception of the seal hunt seems to be based largely on emotion, and on visual images that are often difficult even for experienced observers to interpret with certainty. While a hakapik strike on the skull of a seal appears brutal, it is humane if it achieves rapid, irreversible loss of consciousness leading to death.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesealfishery.com/files/IVWGReportAug2005.pdf |author=Independent Veterinarians Working Group Report |date=August 2005 |accessdate=2011-07-24|title=Improving Humane Practice in the Canadian Harp Seal Hunt}}</ref>\n\n===Ecological feasibility===\nIn 2013, the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans conducted a population survey. The resulting estimate of the harp seal population was 7.3 million animals, over three times what it was in the 1970s.<ref name=\"dfo-mpo.gc.ca\"/> In 2004, the population estimate was similar: 5.9 million (95% CI 4.6 million to 7.2 million).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas/Csas/status/2005/SAR-AS2005_037_E.pdf |title=Stock Assessment of Northwest Atlantic Harp Seals |date= |accessdate=2011-03-03}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the arrival of European settlers, a much larger population of harp seals migrated to the waters off Newfoundland and Labrador. Settlers began exploiting the population, with kills peaking in the middle of the 1800s. In the first half of the 1840s, 546,000 seals were killed annually. This led to a population decline that adversely affected the industry.<ref name=\"heritage.nf.ca\"/>\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s an average of over 291,000 seal pups were killed each year. This led to a population decline to less than 2 million seals. Conservationists became alarmed and demanded controls on kill rates. Thus in 1971, Canada instituted a quota system. In the years from 1971 to 1982, an average of 165,627 seals were killed.\n\nIn 1983, the European Union banned the import of whitecoat harp seal pup pelts (pelts from pups less than about two weeks of age, when the pups molt). As a result, the market for pelts dropped. The kill rates thus declined in subsequent years to an average of about 52,000 seals from 1983 to 1995. During this time, the harp seal population increased.\n\nAfter the European Union's ban on whitecoat pelt imports, the Canadian government and sealing industry developed markets for the pelts of beaters. In 1996, the kill rates again increased to over 200,000 each year, except in the year 2000.

For some sealers, they claim, proceeds from the hunt make up a third of their annual income. Critics, however, say this represents only a tiny fraction of the C$600-million Newfoundland fishing industry. Sealing opponents also say $16.5 million is insignificant, compared to the funding required to regulate and subsidize the hunt. For 1995 and 1996, there are confirmed reports Fisheries and Oceans Canada encouraged maximum utilization of harvested seals through a $0.20 per pound [[meat]] subsidy.<ref name=\"Tobin1996\">{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417064011/http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/media/newsrel/1995/hq-ac142_e.htm|archivedate=2008-04-17|date=1995-12-18|url=http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/media/newsrel/1995/hq-ac142_e.htm|title= Tobin announces 1996 Atlantic Seal Management Plan|publisher=[[Fisheries and Oceans Canada]]|accessdate=2008-02-24}}</ref> The level of subsidy totaled $650,000 in 1997, $440,000 in 1998 and $250,000 in 1999.

Spring 1978, http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic31-1-2.pdf</ref>  Because of the impact of protest, profits surrounding the Inuit hunting of ringed seal fall with any ban on any type of seal product, regardless of exemption. For example, in 1963, prices for high-quality pelts of ringed seals could reach above $20.00 each; these same pelts in 1967, the year of the first major protests, would only sell for $2.50 each, which impacted Inuit in many areas.<ref name=\"WenzelControversy\" /> Protests in other years have resulted in similar decreases in price.<ref name=\"WenzelControversy\" />\n\n====Celebrity involvement====\n[[File:Jacques-Yves Cousteau.jpg|thumb|upright|Marine ecologist [[Jacques Cousteau]] criticized the seal hunt protest as emotional.]]\n\nNumerous celebrities have opposed the commercial seal hunt.
