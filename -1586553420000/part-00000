The Daniel Webster Council moved all summer programs to [[Camp Carpenter]] in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]]. In 1945, the decision was made to sell Camp Manning. Four years later, in 1949, Camp Manning was sold to an independent church group, which opened Camp Leo.<ref name=\"Summer Camp\"/>\n\n=== Hidden Valley & Camp Bell ===\nOn the nearby property, the Norumbega Council (based in [[Waban, Massachusetts]], now a part of the [[Scouting in Massachusetts|Knox Trail Council]]) opened Hidden Valley Scout Reservation. The Norumbega Council operated Hidden Valley from 1961 to 1970. After struggles to maintain the property, the Daniel Webster Council purchased Hidden Valley in the fall of 1970. Shortly after, an additional {{Convert|1000|acres|km2|abbr=}} were added to the property. The purchase was made possible through the generosity of Earle A. Griswold, a\u00a0supporter of the Daniel Webster Council. The name of the property remained the same, Hidden Valley Scout Reservation. It opened for its first season in 1971. \n\nIn 1988, Camp Leo closed. Despite a long run, Camp Leo mostly flourished in the 1950s-'60s. The Daniel Webster Council purchased the property again in 1990.\u00a0This property was incorporated into the existing camp. Around this same time period, Hidden Valley Scout Reservation became the Griswold Hidden Valley Scout Reservation, in remembrance of Earle A. Griswold.<ref>[http://www.troop19.org/dwc/camp/valley/index.htm]</ref>\n\nIn 2000, Camp Bell, a second camp on the property, was established, utilizing the former land of Camp Leo and Camp Manning. The camp is named for the support of Daniel Webster Council Executive Board Member Ernest \"Tutt\" Bell III. Due to the creation of Camp Bell, Griswold Hidden Valley Scout Reservation's name was simplified to Griswold Scout Reservation. The two camps on the Griswold Scout Reservation are now Hidden Valley Scout Camp and Camp Bell.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.troop19.org/dwc/camp/bell/index.htm|title=Camp Bell Index|website=www.troop19.org|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref>\n\n=== Camp Sno-Mo ===\nIn 1989, a unique, \"first-in-the-nation\" partnership was formed between [[Easterseals (U.S.)|Easter Seals of New Hampshire]] and the [[Daniel Webster Council]]. Griswold Scout Reservation became home to the \"Easter Seals Lodge\", which was built alongside an accompanying campsite in 1991. Together, they compose Camp Sno-Mo (named for their primary donor, the NH Snowmobile Association). Campers with a variety of disabilities begin to mainstream into Scouting and other specialized programming at GSR. Many new programs for Scouts, including the Disabilities Awareness Merit Badge, are offered as part of this new partnership.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.easterseals.com/nh/our-programs/camping-recreation/camp-sno-mo.html|title=Camp Sno Mo|website=Easterseals New Hampshire|language=en|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref>\n\n== Landscape ==\nGriswold Scout Reservation is situated in the [[Lakes Region (New Hampshire)|Lakes Region]] of New Hampshire. The property extends through the towns of [[Alton, New Hampshire|Alton]], [[Gilford, New Hampshire|Gilford]], and [[Gilmanton, New Hampshire|Gilmanton]] and covers over {{Convert|3500|acre|km2}} of forest, lakes, and mountains.\n\nGriswold Scout Reservation is situated in the [[Belknap Mountains|Belknap Mountain Range]]. Six mountain peaks are located on the property, Mt. Klem, Mt. Anna, Mt. Mack, Mt. Shannon, Lookout Knob, and Goat Pasture Hill. The property includes three lakes, which are [[Sunset Lake (Lakes Region, New Hampshire)|Sunset Lake]], Manning Lake, and Lake Eileen. Both Manning Lake and Sunset Lake are public bodies of water, while Lake Eileen is owned by Griswold Scout Reservation. GSR is surrounded by remote wilderness on most sides, with hiking trails leading to nearby [[Gunstock Mountain]] or [[Belknap Mountain State Forest]]. Several ponds, four swamps, caves, rock faces, and many hills are situated across the reservation.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://belknaprangetrails.org/mt-anna/|title=Griswold Scout Reservation {{!}} Belknap Range Trails|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref>\n\nSeveral points of interest exist across the property, including the site of a 19th century iron mine, a plane wreck from 1973, and a quarry site from the 1800s.\n\nIn 1991, a conservation easement held by the [[New Hampshire Fish and Game Department]] was placed on the entirety of Griswold Scout Reservation. Due to this, public use of the property is authorized year-round. However, certain areas will be restricted during the summer season.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2016, Griswold Scout Reservation and the Daniel Webster Council were awarded the \"2016 Outstanding Community Tree Farmer of the Year\". The Griswold Scout Reservation exemplifies sound forest management and long-term forest stewardship. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhtreefarm.org/page.php?cmd=page&id=32&sub=60|title=NH Tree Farm, new hampshire tree farm, NH forest society, new hampshire forest society, forest, society, tree, farm, new hampshire|website=www.nhtreefarm.org|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref>\n\n== Hidden Valley Scout Camp ==\nHidden Valley Scout Camp is overseen by a Camp Director, Head Commissioner, and Program Director.  \n\n=== Facilities ===\nHidden Valley features sixteen established campsites of varying sizes. Campsite \"Pioneer\" is reserved for Scouts apart of the Provisional Troop or [[Counselor-in-Training|C.I.T Program.]] Campsites feature canvas walled tents which rest on raised, wooden platforms. Each campsite is equipped with a latrine, with two shower houses spread among the camp. \n\nThe Gilbert Dining Hall, which was built in 1997, serves Scouts three \"family style\" meals a day. It is capable of seating 620 people. Hidden Valley also features a campfire & ceremony amphitheater capable of seating 850 (completed in 2016), and the Carter Lodge Conference center for training or meeting purposes. A 24-hour health lodge, trading post, and chapel are available for Scouts. \n\n=== Programs ===\nHidden Valley is run as a traditional Scout camp with full dining facilities and a wide variety of program areas and activities. Over 60 [[Merit badge (Boy Scouts of America)|merit badges]] are able to be earned by Scouts, along with various training opportunities for Scouters. Three hour-long merit-badge blocks take place after breakfast, with troops participating in various activities after lunch. After dinner, many program areas open for camp-wide activities, often going into the night. \n\nPrograms include low and high [[ropes course]]s as part of the COPE program, a 12-station archery range, a 16-station rifle/pistol range, an automated trap shooting range, three waterfronts with swimming and boating of all kinds on two different lakes, and any of the various week-long high-adventure treks.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://nhscouting.org/outdoor-programs/weekend-camping/|title=Weekend Camping and Facility Rental|website=Daniel Webster Council|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref> \n\n== Camp Bell ==\nCamp Bell is overseen by a Camp Director, Head Commissioner, and Program Director. Camp Bell is run with a higher emphasis on strengthening the [[Patrol Method]]. \n\n=== Facilities ===\nCamp Bell features seven campsites, which are named after various mountains in New Hampshire. They are nearly identical to those of Hidden Valley. The Camp Bell Main Lodge features a health lodge, trading post, camp office, and [[Commissary (store)|commissary]]. A \"safety pavilion\" was built on the property after numerous Scouts were injured in aligning strike in 2013. Recently, several primitive [[Adirondack lean-to|Adirondack shelters]] were built. \n\n=== Programs ===\nCamp Bell is run with a higher emphasis on strengthening the [[Patrol Method]]. Campers do their own cooking in their sites and participate in day-long living-history activities as patrols. Patrols can focus on blacksmithing, logging, snorkeling, water-skiing, or various shooting sports. Camp Bell features an indoor rock climbing barn, an all-terrain vehicle hub with a one-acre, terrain-neutral training site, a 200-seat campfire circle, and a functioning farm. It is ideal for an older-scout bracket.<ref name=\":1\" />  Camp Bell includes various thematic program areas including Challenge Valley (an extreme obstacle course), Mountain Man ([[Muzzleloader|muzzleloaders]] & [[sporting clays]]), Brownsea (outdoor skills area), Logging Camp ([[lumberjack]]), and Foxfire ([[blacksmithing]]).\n\nA week-long [[National Youth Leadership Training]] course takes place at Camp Bell.\n\n== Other history ==\nIn 2013, 23 Scouts were transported to nearby hospitals after a lightning strike at Camp Bell. They had non-life threatening injuries.

It opened for its first season in 1971. \n\nIn 1988, Camp Leo closed. Despite a long run, Camp Leo mostly flourished in the 1950s-'60s. The Daniel Webster Council purchased the property again in 1990.\u00a0This property was incorporated into the existing camp. Around this same time period, Hidden Valley Scout Reservation became the Griswold Hidden Valley Scout Reservation, in remembrance of Earle A. Griswold.<ref>[http://www.troop19.org/dwc/camp/valley/index.htm]</ref>\n\nIn 2000, Camp Bell, a second camp on the property, was established, utilizing the former land of Camp Leo and Camp Manning. The camp is named for the support of Daniel Webster Council Executive Board Member Ernest \"Tutt\" Bell III. Due to the creation of Camp Bell, Griswold Hidden Valley Scout Reservation's name was simplified to Griswold Scout Reservation. The two camps on the Griswold Scout Reservation are now Hidden Valley Scout Camp and Camp Bell.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.troop19.org/dwc/camp/bell/index.htm|title=Camp Bell Index|website=www.troop19.org|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref>\n\n=== Camp Sno-Mo ===\nIn 1989, a unique, \"first-in-the-nation\" partnership was formed between [[Easterseals (U.S.)|Easter Seals of New Hampshire]] and the [[Daniel Webster Council]]. Griswold Scout Reservation became home to the \"Easter Seals Lodge\", which was built alongside an accompanying campsite in 1991. Together, they compose Camp Sno-Mo (named for their primary donor, the NH Snowmobile Association). Campers with a variety of disabilities begin to mainstream into Scouting and other specialized programming at GSR. Many new programs for Scouts, including the Disabilities Awareness Merit Badge, are offered as part of this new partnership.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.easterseals.com/nh/our-programs/camping-recreation/camp-sno-mo.html|title=Camp Sno Mo|website=Easterseals New Hampshire|language=en|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref>\n\n== Landscape ==\nGriswold Scout Reservation is situated in the [[Lakes Region (New Hampshire)|Lakes Region]] of New Hampshire. The property extends through the towns of [[Alton, New Hampshire|Alton]], [[Gilford, New Hampshire|Gilford]], and [[Gilmanton, New Hampshire|Gilmanton]] and covers over {{Convert|3500|acre|km2}} of forest, lakes, and mountains.\n\nGriswold Scout Reservation is situated in the [[Belknap Mountains|Belknap Mountain Range]]. Six mountain peaks are located on the property, Mt. Klem, Mt. Anna, Mt. Mack, Mt. Shannon, Lookout Knob, and Goat Pasture Hill. The property includes three lakes, which are [[Sunset Lake (Lakes Region, New Hampshire)|Sunset Lake]], Manning Lake, and Lake Eileen. Both Manning Lake and Sunset Lake are public bodies of water, while Lake Eileen is owned by Griswold Scout Reservation. GSR is surrounded by remote wilderness on most sides, with hiking trails leading to nearby [[Gunstock Mountain]] or [[Belknap Mountain State Forest]]. Several ponds, four swamps, caves, rock faces, and many hills are situated across the reservation.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://belknaprangetrails.org/mt-anna/|title=Griswold Scout Reservation {{!}} Belknap Range Trails|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref>\n\nSeveral points of interest exist across the property, including the site of a 19th century iron mine, a plane wreck from 1973, and a quarry site from the 1800s.\n\nIn 1991, a conservation easement held by the [[New Hampshire Fish and Game Department]] was placed on the entirety of Griswold Scout Reservation. Due to this, public use of the property is authorized year-round. However, certain areas will be restricted during the summer season.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2016, Griswold Scout Reservation and the Daniel Webster Council were awarded the \"2016 Outstanding Community Tree Farmer of the Year\". The Griswold Scout Reservation exemplifies sound forest management and long-term forest stewardship. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhtreefarm.org/page.php?cmd=page&id=32&sub=60|title=NH Tree Farm, new hampshire tree farm, NH forest society, new hampshire forest society, forest, society, tree, farm, new hampshire|website=www.nhtreefarm.org|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref>\n\n== Hidden Valley Scout Camp ==\nHidden Valley Scout Camp is overseen by a Camp Director, Head Commissioner, and Program Director.  \n\n=== Facilities ===\nHidden Valley features sixteen established campsites of varying sizes. Campsite \"Pioneer\" is reserved for Scouts apart of the Provisional Troop or [[Counselor-in-Training|C.I.T Program.]] Campsites feature canvas walled tents which rest on raised, wooden platforms. Each campsite is equipped with a latrine, with two shower houses spread among the camp. \n\nThe Gilbert Dining Hall, which was built in 1997, serves Scouts three \"family style\" meals a day. It is capable of seating 620 people. Hidden Valley also features a campfire & ceremony amphitheater capable of seating 850 (completed in 2016), and the Carter Lodge Conference center for training or meeting purposes. A 24-hour health lodge, trading post, and chapel are available for Scouts. \n\n=== Programs ===\nHidden Valley is run as a traditional Scout camp with full dining facilities and a wide variety of program areas and activities. Over 60 [[Merit badge (Boy Scouts of America)|merit badges]] are able to be earned by Scouts, along with various training opportunities for Scouters. Three hour-long merit-badge blocks take place after breakfast, with troops participating in various activities after lunch. After dinner, many program areas open for camp-wide activities, often going into the night. \n\nPrograms include low and high [[ropes course]]s as part of the COPE program, a 12-station archery range, a 16-station rifle/pistol range, an automated trap shooting range, three waterfronts with swimming and boating of all kinds on two different lakes, and any of the various week-long high-adventure treks.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://nhscouting.org/outdoor-programs/weekend-camping/|title=Weekend Camping and Facility Rental|website=Daniel Webster Council|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref> \n\n== Camp Bell ==\nCamp Bell is overseen by a Camp Director, Head Commissioner, and Program Director. Camp Bell is run with a higher emphasis on strengthening the [[Patrol Method]]. \n\n=== Facilities ===\nCamp Bell features seven campsites, which are named after various mountains in New Hampshire. They are nearly identical to those of Hidden Valley. The Camp Bell Main Lodge features a health lodge, trading post, camp office, and [[Commissary (store)|commissary]]. A \"safety pavilion\" was built on the property after numerous Scouts were injured in aligning strike in 2013. Recently, several primitive [[Adirondack lean-to|Adirondack shelters]] were built. \n\n=== Programs ===\nCamp Bell is run with a higher emphasis on strengthening the [[Patrol Method]]. Campers do their own cooking in their sites and participate in day-long living-history activities as patrols. Patrols can focus on blacksmithing, logging, snorkeling, water-skiing, or various shooting sports. Camp Bell features an indoor rock climbing barn, an all-terrain vehicle hub with a one-acre, terrain-neutral training site, a 200-seat campfire circle, and a functioning farm. It is ideal for an older-scout bracket.<ref name=\":1\" />  Camp Bell includes various thematic program areas including Challenge Valley (an extreme obstacle course), Mountain Man ([[Muzzleloader|muzzleloaders]] & [[sporting clays]]), Brownsea (outdoor skills area), Logging Camp ([[lumberjack]]), and Foxfire ([[blacksmithing]]).\n\nA week-long [[National Youth Leadership Training]] course takes place at Camp Bell.\n\n== Other history ==\nIn 2013, 23 Scouts were transported to nearby hospitals after a lightning strike at Camp Bell. They had non-life threatening injuries. They were a part National Youth Leadership Training.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wmur.com/article/23-boy-scouts-taken-to-hospital-after-lightning-strike-1/5182625|title=23 Boy Scouts taken to hospital after lightning strike|date=2013-06-25|website=WMUR|language=en|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Coord|43|28|37|N|71|19|23|W|type:forest|display=title_region:US-NH}}\n\n{{Scoutorg BSA}}\n\n[[Category:Northeast Region (Boy Scouts of America)]]\n[[Category:Protected areas of New Hampshire]]\n", "name_user": "Ejzynski", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griswold_Scout_Reservation"}

People engage in a variety of sexual acts, ranging from activities done alone (e.g., [[masturbation]]) to acts with another person (e.g., [[sexual intercourse]], [[non-penetrative sex]], [[oral sex]], etc.) in varying patterns of frequency, for a wide variety of reasons. Sexual activity usually results in [[sexual arousal]] and physiological changes in the aroused person, some of which are pronounced while others are more subtle. Sexual activity may also include conduct and activities which are intended to arouse the sexual interest of another or enhance the [[sex life]] of another, such as strategies to find or attract partners ([[courtship]] and [[Display (zoology)|display]] behaviour), or personal interactions between individuals (for instance, [[foreplay]] or [[BDSM]]). Sexual activity may follow sexual arousal.\n\nHuman sexual activity has sociological, cognitive, [[Emotional intimacy|emotional]], [[Physical intimacy|behavioural]] and biological aspects; these include [[Human bonding|personal bonding]], sharing emotions and the [[physiology]] of the [[reproductive system]], [[sex drive]], sexual intercourse and sexual behaviour in all its forms.\n\nIn some cultures, sexual activity is considered acceptable only within marriage, while [[Premarital sex|premarital]] and [[extramarital sex]] are taboo. Some sexual activities are illegal either universally or in some countries or subnational jurisdictions, while some are considered contrary to the [[Norm (social)|norm]]s of certain societies or cultures. Two examples that are criminal offences in most<!--virtually all?--> [[jurisdiction]]s are [[sexual assault]] and sexual activity with a person below the local [[age of consent]].\n\n==Types==\n[[File:Wiki-missionary.png|thumb|Sexual intercourse in the [[missionary position]]]]\n[[File:1925 Wegener Les Delassements dEros 09 anagoria.JPG|thumb|[[Gerda Wegener]]'s 1925 artwork \"Les delassements d'Eros\" (\"The recreations of Eros\"), which depicts sexual activity by two women]]\nSexual activity can be classified in a number of ways: acts which involve one person (also called [[autoeroticism]]) such as [[masturbation]], or two or more people such as [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal sex]], [[anal sex]], [[oral sex]] or [[mutual masturbation]]. [[Sexual penetration|Penetrative sex]] between two people may be described as [[sexual intercourse]], but definitions vary. If there are more than two participants in a sex act, it may be referred to as [[group sex]]. Autoerotic sexual activity can involve use of [[dildo]]s, [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]]s, [[butt plug]]s, and other [[sex toy]]s, though these devices can also be used with a partner.\n\nSexual activity can be classified into the [[gender]] and [[sexual orientation]] of the participants, as well as by the relationship of the participants. For example, the relationships can be ones of marriage, [[intimate partner]]s, casual [[sex partners]] or [[anonymous sex|anonymous]]. Sexual activity can be regarded as [[conventional sex|conventional]] or as [[Kink (sexual)|alternative]], involving, for example, [[Sexual fetishism|fetishism]], [[paraphilia]], or [[BDSM]] activities.<ref name=\"channel1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/health/microsites/0-9/4health/sex/sar_tips.html |title=Sex and Relationships |publisher=Channel 4 |accessdate=30 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504202257/http://www.channel4.com/health/microsites/0-9/4health/sex/sar_tips.html |archivedate=4 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"findarticles.com\">{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_1_18/ai_80957472 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120526192917/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_1_18/ai_80957472 |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 May 2012 |title=Improve your orgasm: you may have thought your sexual pleasure was the one thing that couldn't get any better. Think again \u2013 Sexual Fitness \u2013 physiology &#124; Men's Fitness |publisher=Findarticles.com |accessdate=30 June 2013}}</ref> Fetishism can take many forms ranging from the desire for certain body parts, for example large breasts, navels or foot worship. The object of desire can often be shoes, boots, lingerie, clothing, leather or rubber items. Some non-conventional autoerotic practices can be dangerous. These include [[erotic asphyxiation]] and [[self-bondage]]. The potential for injury or even death that exists while engaging in the partnered versions of these fetishes ([[Fainting game|choking]] and [[Bondage (sexual)|bondage]], respectively) becomes drastically increased in the autoerotic case due to the isolation and lack of assistance in the event of a problem.\n\nSexual activity can be consensual, which means that both or all participants agree to take part and are of the age that they can consent, or it may take place under force or duress, which is often called [[sexual assault]] or rape. In different cultures and countries, various sexual activities may be lawful or illegal in regards to the age, gender, marital status or other factors of the participants, or otherwise contrary to [[social norms]] or generally accepted [[sexual morals]].\n\n==Mating strategies==\n{{main|Human mating strategies}}\nIn [[evolutionary psychology]] and [[behavioral ecology]], human mating strategies are a set of behaviors used by individuals to attract, select, and retain [[Mating|mates]]. Mating strategies overlap with [[reproductive]] strategies, which encompass a broader set of behaviors involving the timing of reproduction and the trade-off between quantity and quality of offspring (see [[life history theory]]).\n\nRelative to other animals, human mating strategies are unique in their relationship with cultural variables such as the institution of [[marriage]].<ref>Low, B. S. (2007). [https://books.google.com/books?id=8K7Hc09xcQAC&pg=PA449#v=onepage&q=%22Ecological%20and%20socio-cultural%20impacts%20on%20mating%20and%20marriage%22 Ecological and socio-cultural impacts on mating and marriage]. Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, 449.</ref> Humans may seek out individuals with the intention of forming a long-term [[intimate relationship]], marriage, [[casual relationship]], or [[friendship]]. The human desire for [[companionship]] is one of the strongest human drives. It is an innate feature of human nature, and may be related to the [[sex drive]]. The human mating process encompasses the social and cultural processes whereby one person may meet another to assess suitability, the [[courtship]] process and the process of forming an [[interpersonal relationship]]. Commonalities, however, can be found between humans and nonhuman animals in mating behavior (see [[animal sexual behavior]]).\n\n==Stages of physiological arousal during sexual stimulation==\n[[File:Kama sutra 24 detail.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This Indian [[Kama sutra]] illustration, which shows a woman on top of a man, depicts the male erection, which is one of the physiological responses to sexual arousal for men.]]\nThe [[Human sexual response cycle|physiological responses]] during [[sexual stimulation]] are fairly similar for both men and women and there are four phases.<ref name=\"Schacter\">{{cite book |author1=Daniel L.

Youth are legally free to have intercourse after they reach the [[age of consent]].\n\nA 1999 survey of students indicated that approximately 40% of ninth graders across the United States report having had sexual intercourse.

Heterosexual sexual practices are subject to laws in many places. In some countries, mostly those where religion has a strong influence on [[social policy]], marriage laws serve the purpose of encouraging people to have sex only within marriage. [[Sodomy laws]] were seen as discouraging same-sex sexual practices, but may affect opposite-sex sexual practices. Laws also ban adults from committing [[sexual abuse]], committing sexual acts with anyone under an [[age of consent]], performing sexual activities in public, and engaging in sexual activities for money (prostitution). Though these laws cover both same-sex and opposite-sex sexual activities, they may differ in regard to punishment, and may be more frequently (or exclusively) enforced on those who engage in same-sex sexual activities.<ref>[http://criminal.findlaw.com/crimes/more-criminal-topics/sex-offenders/sex-offenses-overview.html Sex Offenders and Sex Offenses: Overview.

Gay and lesbian people who pretend to be heterosexual are often referred to as being [[closeted]] (hiding their sexuality in \"the closet\"). \"Closet case\" is a derogatory term used to refer to people who hide their sexuality. Making that orientation public can be called \"[[coming out of the closet]]\" in the case of voluntary disclosure or \"[[outing]]\" in the case of disclosure by others against the subject's wishes (or without their knowledge). Among some communities (called \"men on the DL\" or \"[[Down-low (sexual slang)|down-low]]\"), same-sex sexual behavior is sometimes viewed as solely for physical pleasure. [[Men who have sex with men]], as well as [[women who have sex with women]], or men on the \"down-low\" may engage in sex acts with members of the same sex while continuing sexual and romantic relationships with the opposite sex.\n\nPeople who engage exclusively in same-sex sexual practices may not identify themselves as gay or lesbian. In sex-segregated environments, individuals may seek relationships with others of their own gender (known as [[situational homosexuality]]). In other cases, some people may experiment or explore their sexuality with same (or different) sex sexual activity before defining their [[sexual identity]].

This same couple may emphasize different aspects of intercourse on different occasions, being playful during one episode of intercourse (recreational), experiencing deep emotional connection on another occasion (relational), and later, after discontinuing contraception, seeking to achieve pregnancy (reproductive, or more likely reproductive and relational).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Religious and ethical===\n{{Main|Sexual morality|Religion and sexuality|Norm (sociology)}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = right\n | width = 200\n | footer = [[Khajuraho Group of Monuments|Khajuraho Hindu and Jain temple complex]] is famous for erotic arts. \n | image1 = Kamasutra 106.jpg\n | image2 = Khajuraho-Lakshmana Temple erotic detal1.JPG\n |image3 = 2 Erotic Kama statues of Khajuraho Hindu Temple de Lakshmana Khajur\u00e2ho India 2013.jpg\n}}\n[[File:\u0418\u043d\u0434\u0438\u044f2.jpg|thumb|Erotic sculptures at the main [[Hindu temple]]s of [[Khajuraho Group of Monuments]]]]\nMost world religions have sought to address the moral issues that arise from people's sexuality in society and in human interactions. Each major religion has developed [[moral code]]s covering issues of sexuality, morality, ethics etc. Though these moral codes do not address issues of sexuality directly, they seek to regulate the situations which can give rise to sexual interest and to influence people's sexual activities and practices. However, the effect of religious teaching has at times been limited. For example, though most religions disapprove of [[extramarital sex|extramarital sexual relations]], it has always been widely practiced. Nevertheless, these religious codes have always had a strong influence on peoples' attitudes to issues of modesty in dress, behavior, speech etc.\n\nOn the other hand, some people adopt the view that pleasure is its own justification for sexual activity. [[Hedonism]] is a school of thought which argues that pleasure is the only [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic good]].<ref name=\"stanford\">[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hedonism/ Hedonism], 20 April 2004 ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''</ref>\n\nHuman sexual activity, like many other kinds of activity engaged in by humans, is generally influenced by social rules that are culturally specific and vary widely. These social rules are referred to as [[Sexual ethics|sexual morality]] (what can and can not be done by society's rules) and sexual norms (what is and is not expected).\n\nSexual ethics, morals, and norms relate to issues including deception/honesty, legality, [[fidelity]] and consent. Some activities, known as [[Sex and the law|sex crimes]] in some locations, are illegal in some jurisdictions, including those conducted between (or among) consenting and competent adults (examples include [[sodomy law]] and adult-adult [[incest]]).\n\nSome people who are in a relationship but want to hide polygamous activity (possibly of opposite sexual orientation) from their partner, may solicit consensual sexual activity with others through personal contacts, [[online chat room]]s, or, advertising in select media.\n\n[[Swinging (sexual practice)|Swinging]], on the other hand, involves singles or partners in a [[committed relationship]] engaging in sexual activities with others as a [[recreational sex|recreational]] or social activity.<ref name=\"case_for_swingers\">{{cite journal\n |journal=Electronic Journal of Human Sexuality\n |last=Bergstrand\n |first=Curtis\n |author2=Blevins Williams, Jennifer\n |date=10 October 2000\n |title=Today's Alternative Marriage Styles: The Case of Swingers\n |volume=3\n |accessdate=24 January 2010\n |url=http://www.ejhs.org/volume3/swing/body.htm}}\n</ref> The increasing popularity of swinging is regarded by some as arising from the upsurge in sexual activity during the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s.\n\nSome people engage in various sexual activities as a business transaction.

Given the wide range of practices, some of which may be engaged in by people who do not consider themselves as practicing BDSM, inclusion in the BDSM community or subculture is usually dependent on [[self-identification]] and shared experience. BDSM communities generally welcome anyone with a non-normative streak who identifies with the community; this may include [[cross-dresser]]s, extreme [[body modification]] enthusiasts, [[animal roleplay|animal players]], latex or [[rubber fetishism|rubber aficionados]], and others.\n\nB/D, a form of BDSM, is bondage and discipline.

Participants who exert sexual dominance over their partners are known as dominants or [[Top (BDSM)|tops]], while participants who take the passive, receiving, or obedient role are known as submissives or [[bottom (BDSM)|bottoms]].\n\nIndividuals are also sometimes abbreviated when referred to in writing, so a dominant person may be referred to as a \"dom\" for a man or a woman.  Sometimes a woman may choose to use the female specific term \"Domme\".  Both terms are pronounced the same when spoken.  Individuals who can change between top/dominant and bottom/submissive roles\u2014whether from relationship to relationship or within a given relationship\u2014are known as ''switches''. The precise definition of roles and self-identification is a common subject of debate within the community.<ref name=\"Terms\">{{cite web|last=Grau|first=Johnson|url=http://www.leathernroses.com/generalbdsm/ssbbfaqdefines.htm|title=What do B&D, S&M, D&S, \"top\", \"bottom\" mean|publisher=Leather Roses|date=1995|accessdate=27 January 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080111223259/http://www.leathernroses.com/generalbdsm/ssbbfaqdefines.htm| archivedate= 11 January 2008 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n[[File:Submissivepup.jpg|thumb|Man engaging in \"puppy play\".]]\nIn a 2013 study, the researchers state that BDSM is a sexual act where they play role games, use restraint, use power exchange,\nuse suppression and pain is sometimes involved depending on individual(s).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|title = Psychological Characteristics of BDSM Practitioners|journal = The Journal of Sexual Medicine|date = 1 January 2013|volume = 10|issue = 8|doi = 10.1111/jsm.12192|pmid = 23679066|first = Andreas A.J.|last = Wismeijer|first2 = Marcel A.L.M. van|last2 = Assen|pages=1943\u20131952|url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/4392da9b2d4d8b538ece5828e870bacb154151eb}}</ref> The study serves to challenge the widespread notion that BDSM could be in some way linked to [[psychopathology]]. According to the findings, one who participates in BDSM may have greater strength socially and mentally as well as greater independence than those who do not practice BDSM.<ref name=\":2\" /> It suggests that people who participate in BDSM play have higher subjective well-being, and that this might be due to the fact that BDSM play requires extensive communication. Before any sexual act occurs, the partners must discuss their agreement of their relationship. They discuss how long the play will last, the intensity, their actions, what each participant needs or desires. The sexual acts are all recorded as consensual and pleasurable to both parties.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn a 2015 study, interviewed BDSM participants have mentioned that the activities have helped to create higher levels of connection, intimacy, trust and communication between partners.<ref name=\":0\" /> The study suggests that dominants and submissives exchange control for each other's pleasure and to satisfy a need. The participants have remarked that they enjoy pleasing their partner in any way they can and many surveyed have felt that this is one of the best things about BDSM. It gives a submissive pleasure to do things in general for their dominant. Where a Dominant enjoys making their encounters all about the submissive. They enjoy doing things that makes their submissive happy. The findings indicate that the surveyed submissives and dominants found BDSM play more pleasurable and fun. The participants have also mentioned improvements in their personal growth, romantic relationships, sense of community and self, the dominant's confidence, and their coping with everyday things by giving them a psychological release.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Legal issues==\n{{Main|Sex and the law}}\nThere are many laws and social customs which prohibit, or in some way affect sexual activities. These laws and customs vary from country to country, and have varied over time. They cover, for example, a prohibition to non-consensual sex, to sex outside marriage, to sexual activity in public, besides many others. Many of these restrictions are non-controversial, but some have been the subject of public debate.\n\nMost societies consider it a serious crime to force someone to engage in sexual acts or to engage in sexual activity with someone who does not consent. This is called [[sexual assault]], and if sexual penetration occurs it is called rape, the most serious kind of sexual assault. The details of this distinction may vary among different legal jurisdictions. Also, what constitutes effective consent in sexual matters varies from culture to culture and is frequently debated. Laws regulating the minimum age at which a person can consent to have sex ([[age of consent]]) are frequently the subject of debate, as is [[adolescent sexual behavior]] in general. Some societies have forced marriage, where consent may not be required.\n\n===Same-sex laws===\n{{Main|LGBT rights by country or territory}}\nMany locales have laws that limit or prohibit [[Same-sex relationship|same-sex sexual activity]].\n\n===Sex outside marriage===\nIn the West, sex before marriage is not illegal{{Example needed|date=October 2018}}.

People engage in a variety of sexual acts, ranging from activities done alone (e.g., [[masturbation]]) to acts with another person (e.g., [[sexual intercourse]], [[non-penetrative sex]], [[oral sex]], etc.) in varying patterns of frequency, for a wide variety of reasons. Sexual activity usually results in [[sexual arousal]] and physiological changes in the aroused person, some of which are pronounced while others are more subtle. Sexual activity may also include conduct and activities which are intended to arouse the sexual interest of another or enhance the [[sex life]] of another, such as strategies to find or attract partners ([[courtship]] and [[Display (zoology)|display]] behaviour), or personal interactions between individuals (for instance, [[foreplay]] or [[BDSM]]). Sexual activity may follow sexual arousal.\n\nHuman sexual activity has sociological, cognitive, [[Emotional intimacy|emotional]], [[Physical intimacy|behavioural]] and biological aspects; these include [[Human bonding|personal bonding]], sharing emotions and the [[physiology]] of the [[reproductive system]], [[sex drive]], sexual intercourse and sexual behaviour in all its forms.\n\nIn some cultures, sexual activity is considered acceptable only within marriage, while [[Premarital sex|premarital]] and [[extramarital sex]] are taboo. Some sexual activities are illegal either universally or in some countries or subnational jurisdictions, while some are considered contrary to the [[Norm (social)|norm]]s of certain societies or cultures. Two examples that are criminal offences in most<!--virtually all?--> [[jurisdiction]]s are [[sexual assault]] and sexual activity with a person below the local [[age of consent]].\n\n==Types==\n[[File:Wiki-missionary.png|thumb|Sexual intercourse in the [[missionary position]]]]\n[[File:1925 Wegener Les Delassements dEros 09 anagoria.JPG|thumb|[[Gerda Wegener]]'s 1925 artwork \"Les delassements d'Eros\" (\"The recreations of Eros\"), which depicts sexual activity by two women]]\nSexual activity can be classified in a number of ways: acts which involve one person (also called [[autoeroticism]]) such as [[masturbation]], or two or more people such as [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal sex]], [[anal sex]], [[oral sex]] or [[mutual masturbation]]. [[Sexual penetration|Penetrative sex]] between two people may be described as [[sexual intercourse]], but definitions vary. If there are more than two participants in a sex act, it may be referred to as [[group sex]]. Autoerotic sexual activity can involve use of [[dildo]]s, [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]]s, [[butt plug]]s, and other [[sex toy]]s, though these devices can also be used with a partner.\n\nSexual activity can be classified into the [[gender]] and [[sexual orientation]] of the participants, as well as by the relationship of the participants. For example, the relationships can be ones of marriage, [[intimate partner]]s, casual [[sex partners]] or [[anonymous sex|anonymous]]. Sexual activity can be regarded as [[conventional sex|conventional]] or as [[Kink (sexual)|alternative]], involving, for example, [[Sexual fetishism|fetishism]], [[paraphilia]], or [[BDSM]] activities.<ref name=\"channel1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/health/microsites/0-9/4health/sex/sar_tips.html |title=Sex and Relationships |publisher=Channel 4 |accessdate=30 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504202257/http://www.channel4.com/health/microsites/0-9/4health/sex/sar_tips.html |archivedate=4 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"findarticles.com\">{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_1_18/ai_80957472 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120526192917/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_1_18/ai_80957472 |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 May 2012 |title=Improve your orgasm: you may have thought your sexual pleasure was the one thing that couldn't get any better.

The object of desire can often be shoes, boots, lingerie, clothing, leather or rubber items. Some non-conventional autoerotic practices can be dangerous. These include [[erotic asphyxiation]] and [[self-bondage]]. The potential for injury or even death that exists while engaging in the partnered versions of these fetishes ([[Fainting game|choking]] and [[Bondage (sexual)|bondage]], respectively) becomes drastically increased in the autoerotic case due to the isolation and lack of assistance in the event of a problem.\n\nSexual activity can be consensual, which means that both or all participants agree to take part and are of the age that they can consent, or it may take place under force or duress, which is often called [[sexual assault]] or rape. In different cultures and countries, various sexual activities may be lawful or illegal in regards to the age, gender, marital status or other factors of the participants, or otherwise contrary to [[social norms]] or generally accepted [[sexual morals]].\n\n==Mating strategies==\n{{main|Human mating strategies}}\nIn [[evolutionary psychology]] and [[behavioral ecology]], human mating strategies are a set of behaviors used by individuals to attract, select, and retain [[Mating|mates]]. Mating strategies overlap with [[reproductive]] strategies, which encompass a broader set of behaviors involving the timing of reproduction and the trade-off between quantity and quality of offspring (see [[life history theory]]).\n\nRelative to other animals, human mating strategies are unique in their relationship with cultural variables such as the institution of [[marriage]].<ref>Low, B. S. (2007). [https://books.google.com/books?id=8K7Hc09xcQAC&pg=PA449#v=onepage&q=%22Ecological%20and%20socio-cultural%20impacts%20on%20mating%20and%20marriage%22 Ecological and socio-cultural impacts on mating and marriage]. Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, 449.</ref> Humans may seek out individuals with the intention of forming a long-term [[intimate relationship]], marriage, [[casual relationship]], or [[friendship]]. The human desire for [[companionship]] is one of the strongest human drives. It is an innate feature of human nature, and may be related to the [[sex drive]]. The human mating process encompasses the social and cultural processes whereby one person may meet another to assess suitability, the [[courtship]] process and the process of forming an [[interpersonal relationship]]. Commonalities, however, can be found between humans and nonhuman animals in mating behavior (see [[animal sexual behavior]]).\n\n==Stages of physiological arousal during sexual stimulation==\n[[File:Kama sutra 24 detail.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This Indian [[Kama sutra]] illustration, which shows a woman on top of a man, depicts the male erection, which is one of the physiological responses to sexual arousal for men.]]\nThe [[Human sexual response cycle|physiological responses]] during [[sexual stimulation]] are fairly similar for both men and women and there are four phases.<ref name=\"Schacter\">{{cite book |author1=Daniel L.

From a biochemical perspective, sex causes the release of endorphins and increases levels of white blood cells that actually boost the immune system. A study published in the journal Biological Psychology described how men who had had sex the previous night responded better to stressful situations, it suggested that if a person is regularly sexual, they're regularly relaxed, and when the person is relaxed, they cope better with stressful situations. {{citation needed|date=June 2016}} A 2007 study published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior 36, (no. 3 (June 2007): 357\u201368) reported that sexual behavior with a partner on one day significantly predicted lower negative mood and stress, and higher positive mood, on the following day.

(See [[Virginity#Prevalence of virginity|Prevalence of virginity]].) The first sexual act of a child or adolescent is sometimes referred to as the [[sexualization]] of the child, and may be considered as a milestone or a change of status, as the loss of [[virginity]] or innocence. Youth are legally free to have intercourse after they reach the [[age of consent]].\n\nA 1999 survey of students indicated that approximately 40% of ninth graders across the United States report having had sexual intercourse. This figure rises with each grade. Males are more sexually active than females at each of the grade levels surveyed. Sexual activity of young adolescents differs in ethnicity as well. A higher percent of African American and Hispanic adolescents are shown to be more sexually active than White adolescents.<ref>Meece, Judith L. Child and Adolescent Development for Educators. New York: McGraw Hill, 2008. Print.</ref>\n\nResearch on sexual frequency has also been conducted solely on female adolescents who engage in sexual activity.  Female adolescents tended to engage in more sexual activity due to positive mood. In female teenagers, engaging in sexual activity was directly positively correlated with being older, greater sexual activity in the previous week or prior day, and more positive mood the previous day or the same day as the sexual activity occurred.<ref name=\"Fortenberry D.J., Temkit M., Tu W., Graham C.A., Katz B. 2005 252\u2013257\">{{cite journal |author1=Fortenberry D.J. |author2=Temkit M. |author3=Tu W. |author4=Graham C.A. |author5=Katz B. | year = 2005 | title = Daily Mood, Partner Support, Sexual Interest, and Sexual Activity Among Adolescent Women | url = http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/4803| journal = Health Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 3| pages = 252\u2013257 | doi = 10.1037/0278-6133.24.3.252 |pmid=15898860 |type=Submitted manuscript }}</ref> Decreased sexual activity was associated with prior or current day negative mood or menstruating.<ref name=\"Fortenberry D.J., Temkit M., Tu W., Graham C.A., Katz B. 2005 252\u2013257\"/>\n\nAlthough opinions differ, others{{who|date=September 2016}} suggest that sexual activity is an essential part of humans, and that teenagers need to experience sex.

Regression analysis, factors considered important to female sexual activity included: sexual desire, valuing sexuality, and a healthy partner, while high sexual self-esteem, good health, and active sexual history were important to male sexual activity.

Heterosexual sexual practices are subject to laws in many places. In some countries, mostly those where religion has a strong influence on [[social policy]], marriage laws serve the purpose of encouraging people to have sex only within marriage. [[Sodomy laws]] were seen as discouraging same-sex sexual practices, but may affect opposite-sex sexual practices. Laws also ban adults from committing [[sexual abuse]], committing sexual acts with anyone under an [[age of consent]], performing sexual activities in public, and engaging in sexual activities for money (prostitution). Though these laws cover both same-sex and opposite-sex sexual activities, they may differ in regard to punishment, and may be more frequently (or exclusively) enforced on those who engage in same-sex sexual activities.<ref>[http://criminal.findlaw.com/crimes/more-criminal-topics/sex-offenders/sex-offenses-overview.html Sex Offenders and Sex Offenses: Overview.

Gay and lesbian people who pretend to be heterosexual are often referred to as being [[closeted]] (hiding their sexuality in \"the closet\"). \"Closet case\" is a derogatory term used to refer to people who hide their sexuality. Making that orientation public can be called \"[[coming out of the closet]]\" in the case of voluntary disclosure or \"[[outing]]\" in the case of disclosure by others against the subject's wishes (or without their knowledge). Among some communities (called \"men on the DL\" or \"[[Down-low (sexual slang)|down-low]]\"), same-sex sexual behavior is sometimes viewed as solely for physical pleasure. [[Men who have sex with men]], as well as [[women who have sex with women]], or men on the \"down-low\" may engage in sex acts with members of the same sex while continuing sexual and romantic relationships with the opposite sex.\n\nPeople who engage exclusively in same-sex sexual practices may not identify themselves as gay or lesbian. In sex-segregated environments, individuals may seek relationships with others of their own gender (known as [[situational homosexuality]]). In other cases, some people may experiment or explore their sexuality with same (or different) sex sexual activity before defining their [[sexual identity]].

This same couple may emphasize different aspects of intercourse on different occasions, being playful during one episode of intercourse (recreational), experiencing deep emotional connection on another occasion (relational), and later, after discontinuing contraception, seeking to achieve pregnancy (reproductive, or more likely reproductive and relational).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Religious and ethical===\n{{Main|Sexual morality|Religion and sexuality|Norm (sociology)}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = right\n | width = 200\n | footer = [[Khajuraho Group of Monuments|Khajuraho Hindu and Jain temple complex]] is famous for erotic arts. \n | image1 = Kamasutra 106.jpg\n | image2 = Khajuraho-Lakshmana Temple erotic detal1.JPG\n |image3 = 2 Erotic Kama statues of Khajuraho Hindu Temple de Lakshmana Khajur\u00e2ho India 2013.jpg\n}}\n[[File:\u0418\u043d\u0434\u0438\u044f2.jpg|thumb|Erotic sculptures at the main [[Hindu temple]]s of [[Khajuraho Group of Monuments]]]]\nMost world religions have sought to address the moral issues that arise from people's sexuality in society and in human interactions. Each major religion has developed [[moral code]]s covering issues of sexuality, morality, ethics etc. Though these moral codes do not address issues of sexuality directly, they seek to regulate the situations which can give rise to sexual interest and to influence people's sexual activities and practices. However, the effect of religious teaching has at times been limited. For example, though most religions disapprove of [[extramarital sex|extramarital sexual relations]], it has always been widely practiced. Nevertheless, these religious codes have always had a strong influence on peoples' attitudes to issues of modesty in dress, behavior, speech etc.\n\nOn the other hand, some people adopt the view that pleasure is its own justification for sexual activity.

The participants have remarked that they enjoy pleasing their partner in any way they can and many surveyed have felt that this is one of the best things about BDSM. It gives a submissive pleasure to do things in general for their dominant. Where a Dominant enjoys making their encounters all about the submissive. They enjoy doing things that makes their submissive happy. The findings indicate that the surveyed submissives and dominants found BDSM play more pleasurable and fun. The participants have also mentioned improvements in their personal growth, romantic relationships, sense of community and self, the dominant's confidence, and their coping with everyday things by giving them a psychological release.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Legal issues==\n{{Main|Sex and the law}}\nThere are many laws and social customs which prohibit, or in some way affect sexual activities. These laws and customs vary from country to country, and have varied over time. They cover, for example, a prohibition to non-consensual sex, to sex outside marriage, to sexual activity in public, besides many others. Many of these restrictions are non-controversial, but some have been the subject of public debate.\n\nMost societies consider it a serious crime to force someone to engage in sexual acts or to engage in sexual activity with someone who does not consent. This is called [[sexual assault]], and if sexual penetration occurs it is called rape, the most serious kind of sexual assault. The details of this distinction may vary among different legal jurisdictions. Also, what constitutes effective consent in sexual matters varies from culture to culture and is frequently debated. Laws regulating the minimum age at which a person can consent to have sex ([[age of consent]]) are frequently the subject of debate, as is [[adolescent sexual behavior]] in general. Some societies have forced marriage, where consent may not be required.\n\n===Same-sex laws===\n{{Main|LGBT rights by country or territory}}\nMany locales have laws that limit or prohibit [[Same-sex relationship|same-sex sexual activity]].\n\n===Sex outside marriage===\nIn the West, sex before marriage is not illegal{{Example needed|date=October 2018}}. There are social taboos and many religions condemn pre-marital sex.
