The game was released on 15 November 2011 in North America, 24 November 2011 in Australia, and 25 November 2011 in Europe for [[PlayStation 3]], [[Wii]] and [[Xbox 360]]. It was released later for [[PlayStation Vita]], [[Microsoft Windows]], and [[Nintendo 3DS]]. The [[OS X]] version of the game was released on 12 December 2013 by [[Feral Interactive]].<ref name=\"feralinteractive.com\"/> The story follows [[Rayman (character)|Rayman]], his friend Globox and two teensies as they fight Darktoons and other evil creatures that have infected the Glade of Dreams.\n\n''Rayman Origins'' has received critical acclaim, being highly praised for its graphical style, level design, and sense of humor. Despite its critical reception, the game did not perform very well commercially during its original release selling below sales expectations at the end of its first month. A mobile game based on ''Origins'', titled '''''Rayman Jungle Run''''', was developed by Pastagames and released for [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and for Windows Phone 8 on 29 May 2013. A sequel, ''[[Rayman Legends]]'', was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation Vita]], [[Wii U]] and [[Xbox 360]] on 29 August 2013 in Australia, 30 August 2013 in Europe, and 3 September 2013 in North America to similar critical acclaim.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Rayman and Betilla (Rayman Origins).jpg|thumb|left|Rayman and Betilla]]\nAt the beginning of the game, Bubble Dreamer, [[Rayman (character)|Rayman]], his best friend Globox, and a couple of Teensies friends are chilling out at Bubble Dreamer's resting grounds, the Snoring Tree. However, their snoring, with the help of a strange microphone disguised to resemble a flower, disturbs an old granny from the Land of the Livid Dead, who retaliates by sending an evil army of horrendous creatures and the Darktoons across the world. The heroes, being woke up, attempt to fight back, but are defeated and captured. Rayman escapes and finds the Darktoons have captured the Electoons that inhabit the world, imprisoned Betilla the Nymph and her sisters and plunged the Glade of Dreams into chaos. This causes Bubble Dreamer to go crazy, and as a result, have nightmares. Rayman and his friends are then tasked by the Magician to gather enough Electoons to cure Bubble Dreamer and restore the Glade. Their efforts to locate the Electoons allow them to gain access to the various lands of the Glade, and rescue the Nymphs along the way.\n\nEventually, they make their way to a mysterious gate, which can only be opened by rescuing the Glade Kings, who have been turned into monsters as a result of Bubble Dreamer's nightmares. Upon freeing the Glade Kings, the Nymphs are able to open the stargate, granting Rayman access to a hideout in the land of Moody Clouds. There, they discover that their supposed friend, the Magician, is the one responsible for all the chaos. He secretly admires Mr. Dark,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://raymanpc.com/wiki/script-en/images/a/a3/Gabrielle_Shrager_Facebook_conversation.jpg|title=Gabrielle Shrager Facebook Conversation|author=Shrager, Gabrielle|publisher=Rayman Pirate-Community|date=January 17, 2012|accessdate=February 8, 2012}}</ref> the villain of the original ''Rayman'', and was behind the events that caused the Land of the Livid Dead forces to attack, preoccupying the heroes and using the Lums they had given him to power and use his diabolical machines. The Magician then sends Rayman and his friends into a pit with his mechanical monsters, but they escape and return to his office. The Magician then begins to dance and sends them into a dancing funk, using this as a good time to escape. The heroes chase after and fight the Magician in his escape airship, sending it crashing into the power source of his hideout. The resulting chain of events causes the hideout to explode, while Rayman and his friends free-fall back to the Snoring Tree, where they proceed to resume their relaxation.\n\nIf players manage to collect the ten ruby teeth throughout the game, they can gain access to the Land of the Livid Dead, where another monster awaits.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Rayman Origins gameplay screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|''Rayman Origins'' co-operative gameplay]]\n''Rayman Origins'' is a [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[Platform game|platformer]], the same style as the [[Rayman (video game)|original ''Rayman'' game]]. ''Rayman Origins'' is playable with up to four local players who may drop in or out at any time. Players can choose to control either [[Rayman (character)|Rayman]], Globox or two Teensies, with additional costumes available as the game progresses.<ref name=\"GI-218\" />\n\nPlayers travel through each level, fighting enemies and rescuing imprisoned Electoons. As the game progresses, players gain new abilities such as running up walls, gliding in midair, swimming and shrinking in size to reach new areas. Certain segments also see players riding a mosquito, where players can shoot enemies or inhale and fire them. If a character is hit by an enemy or hazard, they will \"bubblize\", or inflate into a ballooned state. To get out of this state, another player can slap, or jump on them, similar to ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]''. Players can also collect hearts that will protect them from one hit. However, if all players are bubblized simultaneously, or if a character is hit during single play, they will explode and the play will return to the last checkpoint, normally a Darkblocker where the player had go through before, or the last place where the player broke a cage. Throughout each level, players can collect yellow Lums, which they will need for Electoons. When a character collects a Lum King, it turns all Lums red for a short time. Red Lums are worth two yellow Lums.<ref name=\"pree3-destr\" /><ref name=\"e32011-gamespotpreview\">{{cite web|url=http://e3.gamespot.com/story/6316225/rayman-origins-exclusive-first-look-preview|title=Rayman Origins Exclusive First Look Preview|author=Mark Walton|publisher=Gamespot UK|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812033625/http://e3.gamespot.com/story/6316225/rayman-origins-exclusive-first-look-preview|archivedate=August 12, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> There are also Skull Coins placed in hidden or dangerous areas. They are worth 25 Lums if successfully collected. If the player gets harmed while collecting a Skull Coin, they will lose it. In this situation, the player must try again to get the coin.\n\nIn order to progress through certain parts of the story, players need to free Electoons. The most common way to get Electoons is to free them from cages; there is one at the end of each level, with more to be found in hidden areas and are guarded by several enemies that collectively use a forcefield to protect the cage, the team must defeat every single enemy that uses the forcefield, then the cage can be destroyed. The cage can only be damaged on the side which has a green padlock. Most of the cages are hidden away in secret passages, so once the Electoons are free, they will create a portal which leads to the outside of these passages. Each level contains a medallion that shows how many Electoon challenges the players completed, such as break a single cage, collect a specific amount of Lums or beat the clock whilst the level has been completed. In every level there are hidden cages ranging from 1 to 3. More Electoons can be earned by collecting a certain amount of Lums within a level and clearing Time Trials that are unlocked after clearing a level once. Scoring high marks in either of these challenges can also earn medals and trophies. Players can also unlock special 'treasure chest' levels, in which they must chase a runaway treasure chest across a dangerous course in order to receive a skull tooth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/rayman-origins-full-access-preview/ |title=Rayman Origins \u2013 Full Access Preview, Rayman Origins Xbox 360 Features |publisher=GamesRadar |date=October 26, 2011 |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}</ref> Completing all of the teeth grants access to the [[Bonus stage|bonus level]], The  Land of the Livid Dead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/uk-10-rayman-origins/724153 |title=Rayman Origins Video Game, UK 10 Ways To Beat The Game Trailer HD &#124; Video Clip &#124; Game Trailers & Videos |publisher=GameTrailers.com |date=November 18, 2011 |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\nWhile every version of the game is nearly identical due to the game engine's high versatility, there are some minor differences across platforms.

Despite its critical reception, the game did not perform very well commercially during its original release selling below sales expectations at the end of its first month.

However, their snoring, with the help of a strange microphone disguised to resemble a flower, disturbs an old granny from the Land of the Livid Dead, who retaliates by sending an evil army of horrendous creatures and the Darktoons across the world. The heroes, being woke up, attempt to fight back, but are defeated and captured. Rayman escapes and finds the Darktoons have captured the Electoons that inhabit the world, imprisoned Betilla the Nymph and her sisters and plunged the Glade of Dreams into chaos. This causes Bubble Dreamer to go crazy, and as a result, have nightmares. Rayman and his friends are then tasked by the Magician to gather enough Electoons to cure Bubble Dreamer and restore the Glade. Their efforts to locate the Electoons allow them to gain access to the various lands of the Glade, and rescue the Nymphs along the way.\n\nEventually, they make their way to a mysterious gate, which can only be opened by rescuing the Glade Kings, who have been turned into monsters as a result of Bubble Dreamer's nightmares. Upon freeing the Glade Kings, the Nymphs are able to open the stargate, granting Rayman access to a hideout in the land of Moody Clouds. There, they discover that their supposed friend, the Magician, is the one responsible for all the chaos. He secretly admires Mr. Dark,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://raymanpc.com/wiki/script-en/images/a/a3/Gabrielle_Shrager_Facebook_conversation.jpg|title=Gabrielle Shrager Facebook Conversation|author=Shrager, Gabrielle|publisher=Rayman Pirate-Community|date=January 17, 2012|accessdate=February 8, 2012}}</ref> the villain of the original ''Rayman'', and was behind the events that caused the Land of the Livid Dead forces to attack, preoccupying the heroes and using the Lums they had given him to power and use his diabolical machines. The Magician then sends Rayman and his friends into a pit with his mechanical monsters, but they escape and return to his office. The Magician then begins to dance and sends them into a dancing funk, using this as a good time to escape. The heroes chase after and fight the Magician in his escape airship, sending it crashing into the power source of his hideout. The resulting chain of events causes the hideout to explode, while Rayman and his friends free-fall back to the Snoring Tree, where they proceed to resume their relaxation.\n\nIf players manage to collect the ten ruby teeth throughout the game, they can gain access to the Land of the Livid Dead, where another monster awaits.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Rayman Origins gameplay screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|''Rayman Origins'' co-operative gameplay]]\n''Rayman Origins'' is a [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[Platform game|platformer]], the same style as the [[Rayman (video game)|original ''Rayman'' game]]. ''Rayman Origins'' is playable with up to four local players who may drop in or out at any time. Players can choose to control either [[Rayman (character)|Rayman]], Globox or two Teensies, with additional costumes available as the game progresses.<ref name=\"GI-218\" />\n\nPlayers travel through each level, fighting enemies and rescuing imprisoned Electoons. As the game progresses, players gain new abilities such as running up walls, gliding in midair, swimming and shrinking in size to reach new areas. Certain segments also see players riding a mosquito, where players can shoot enemies or inhale and fire them. If a character is hit by an enemy or hazard, they will \"bubblize\", or inflate into a ballooned state. To get out of this state, another player can slap, or jump on them, similar to ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]''. Players can also collect hearts that will protect them from one hit. However, if all players are bubblized simultaneously, or if a character is hit during single play, they will explode and the play will return to the last checkpoint, normally a Darkblocker where the player had go through before, or the last place where the player broke a cage. Throughout each level, players can collect yellow Lums, which they will need for Electoons. When a character collects a Lum King, it turns all Lums red for a short time. Red Lums are worth two yellow Lums.<ref name=\"pree3-destr\" /><ref name=\"e32011-gamespotpreview\">{{cite web|url=http://e3.gamespot.com/story/6316225/rayman-origins-exclusive-first-look-preview|title=Rayman Origins Exclusive First Look Preview|author=Mark Walton|publisher=Gamespot UK|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812033625/http://e3.gamespot.com/story/6316225/rayman-origins-exclusive-first-look-preview|archivedate=August 12, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> There are also Skull Coins placed in hidden or dangerous areas. They are worth 25 Lums if successfully collected. If the player gets harmed while collecting a Skull Coin, they will lose it. In this situation, the player must try again to get the coin.\n\nIn order to progress through certain parts of the story, players need to free Electoons. The most common way to get Electoons is to free them from cages; there is one at the end of each level, with more to be found in hidden areas and are guarded by several enemies that collectively use a forcefield to protect the cage, the team must defeat every single enemy that uses the forcefield, then the cage can be destroyed. The cage can only be damaged on the side which has a green padlock. Most of the cages are hidden away in secret passages, so once the Electoons are free, they will create a portal which leads to the outside of these passages. Each level contains a medallion that shows how many Electoon challenges the players completed, such as break a single cage, collect a specific amount of Lums or beat the clock whilst the level has been completed. In every level there are hidden cages ranging from 1 to 3. More Electoons can be earned by collecting a certain amount of Lums within a level and clearing Time Trials that are unlocked after clearing a level once. Scoring high marks in either of these challenges can also earn medals and trophies. Players can also unlock special 'treasure chest' levels, in which they must chase a runaway treasure chest across a dangerous course in order to receive a skull tooth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/rayman-origins-full-access-preview/ |title=Rayman Origins \u2013 Full Access Preview, Rayman Origins Xbox 360 Features |publisher=GamesRadar |date=October 26, 2011 |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}</ref> Completing all of the teeth grants access to the [[Bonus stage|bonus level]], The  Land of the Livid Dead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/uk-10-rayman-origins/724153 |title=Rayman Origins Video Game, UK 10 Ways To Beat The Game Trailer HD &#124; Video Clip &#124; Game Trailers & Videos |publisher=GameTrailers.com |date=November 18, 2011 |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\nWhile every version of the game is nearly identical due to the game engine's high versatility, there are some minor differences across platforms.

Defeat in the final after three victories was considered no shame, and Stevenson firmly established himself as Cuba's premier heavyweight. Back in the gym Chervonenko and leading Cuban boxing coach [[Alcides Sagarra]] worked on Stevenson's jab, which became his ultimate weapon, and paid dividends when the Cuban easily defeated East Germany's [[Bernd Anders]] in front of a surprised Berlin crowd. The victory made the entire amateur boxing world take notice of Stevenson as a serious heavyweight contender.<ref>Duncan, p-80-81</ref>\n\n===Munich Olympics 1972===\nStevenson, now twenty, joined the Cuban boxing team for the [[1972 Summer Olympics|Munich Olympics of 1972]]. His opening bout against experienced Polish fighter [[Ludwik Denderys]] began dramatically when Stevenson knocked the other man down within thirty seconds of the opening bell. The fight was stopped moments later due to a large cut next to the Pole's eye.\n\nProceeding to the quarter finals, Stevenson met American boxer [[Duane Bobick]]. Bobick, a gold medalist at the [[Boxing at the 1971 Pan American Games|1971 Pan American Games]], had beaten Stevenson previously. After a close first round, Stevenson lost the second, but a ferocious display in the third round knocked Bobick to the canvas three times and the contest was stopped. The victory was viewed on television throughout Cuba, and is still considered Stevenson's most memorable performance.\n\nStevenson easily defeated German [[Peter Hussing]] in the semifinal by TKO in the 2nd round, and received his gold medal after Romanian [[Ion Alexe]] failed to appear in the final due to injury. The Cuban boxing team won three gold medals, their first in Olympic boxing history, as well as one silver and one bronze. The Munich games established Cuba's dominance over the amateur sport that was to last decades. It also established Stevenson as the world's premier amateur heavyweight boxer.\n\nLess than two years after his successful performance at the Munich Olympics, Stevenson, then 22-year-old, was rewarded with a house for himself in Havana and another for himself and his family in [[Delicias, Cuba|Delicias]]. Stevenson later recalled: \"I had no idea the house in Delicias was going to be so big. When I was shown the plans, I said, \u2018What is this? A bunker?\u2019\" AIBA President [[Anwar Chowdhry]], when asked did the Cuban authorities acted properly in giving Stevenson two houses and two cars, said: \"These things should not be allowed. If gifts are to be given it should be for everybody\u2014not for a few.\" Over tea in his office in Havana's [[Sports City Coliseum]], INDER President Conrado Mart\u00ednez Corona defended the local practice of giving cars and apartments to top athletes. \"Our country has the obligation of solving the problems of all citizens\u2014the problems of their nourishment, housing, education and health,\" he said. \"It's a pity we can't solve this problem in the way we need to for everybody.\"<ref name=\"Brubaker\">{{cite journal |last= Brubaker|first= Bill|author-link= Bill Brubaker|date= February 21, 1986|title= A Boxer to Whom Money Didn't Talk|journal= [[The Washington Post]]|pages= A1}}</ref>\n\n===Prime years===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Teofilo Stevenson wins.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Te\u00f3filo Stevenson wins over Piotr Zaev]] -->\nStevenson did the same at the inaugural [[1974 World Amateur Boxing Championships|1974 World Championships]] in [[Havana, Cuba]], and then in the [[1976 Summer Olympics]], held in [[Montreal]], Stevenson repeated the feat once again.

This fight ended an eleven-year unbeaten run by Stevenson and was the only occasion that he did not win the gold medal at the World Championships when he entered the competition.\n\nHiss loss by a split decision to Aleksandr Lukstin of the Soviet Union in the finals of the 1983 C\u00f3rdova Card\u00edn, as the Soviet head coach Kontsantin Koptsev later admitted, was due to a plaster-like tape they [[Hand wrap|handwrapped]] Lukstin's fists instead of a regular elastic-band hand wrapping.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW3NN7YY4cM&t=1804 \u0422\u0435\u0440\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0431\u043e\u043a\u0441\u0430 - \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0439 \u041a\u0443\u0440\u043d\u044f\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043d \u041a\u043e\u043f\u0446\u0435\u0432 (\u0412\u044b\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a 28)] (in Russian)</ref>\n\nStevenson might have won a fourth gold medal at the [[1984 Summer Olympics]], but the [[Soviet Union]] boycotted the games, which were hosted by Los Angeles, in retaliation for the American boycott of the 1980 Moscow competition.

Vysotsky later revealed in his interview to ''East Side Boxing'':<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=9323&more=1|title=SOVIET LEGENDS: Igor Vysotsky \u2013 The man who had Teofilo Stevenson\u2019s number!\" ESB EXCLUSIVE Interview!|last=Komarnitzky|first=Gennadiy|author2=Koza, Izyaslav |date=24 December 2006|publisher=East Side Boxing}}</ref>\n{{quote|text=I fought Teofilo twice. We first met at the \u201cC\u00f3rdova Card\u00edn\u201d tournament in 1973 in Cuba. I took the first two opponents, both being Cuban, out early. In the third, I beat Stevenson on points. Although the score was 3:2, the pace of the fight forced Te\u00f3filo to take two necessary breaks to retie his gloves. We had a saying in the USSR, \u201cIt\u2019s easier to win the World championships than it is to win \u2018C\u00f3rdova Card\u00edn\u2019.\u201d The second time was at a class A International tournament in [[Minsk]], in March 1976. In each stanza, Stevenson took a count, while in the final three minutes, I knocked him out. |sign=Igor Vysotsky|source=Interview with ''East Side Boxing'', 2006}}\n\nVysotsky was the only boxer out of hundreds of Stevenson's opponents to ever stop him, let alone by knockout, and to defeat him twice, both times in his prime, without being avenged. And on top of it, Vysotsky scored his first victory over Stevenson at the C\u00f3rdova Card\u00edn, Cubans' home tournament, where they do their best to never let any foreigner get into the finals.\n\nStevenson's second loss to Vysotsky happened six weeks before his knockout winning streak at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal, which ended up with a victories over [[John Tate (boxer)|John Tate]] and [[Mircea \u0218imon]].

Stevenson was often dubbed by the American media as the Ali's \"Communist twin,\" speculations went back and forth as to their much anticipated fight if Te\u00f3 would accept offer to turn pro (which in essence meant to defect and to leave Cuba permanently.) Along with [[Pete Rademacher]], he was the only amateur boxer who was offered a shot at the world's heavyweight title in his potential pro debut. Eventually Ali will spend one week in Cuba with Stevenson, but their matchup would never happen.<ref name=\"Brubaker\" /> Stevenson, when he finally met Ali, suggested to Ali to arrange a three-four rounds fight. Muhammad refused to do it in Teofilo's way, implying he would face him off in a standard 15-rounds championship bout, in which he would have an edge by outlasting his opponent<ref name=\"Grimsley\">[https://newspaperarchive.com/hanover-evening-sun-jul-25-1980-p-10/ Cuban Heavyweight Looks For 3rd Gold] by Will Grimsley (AP Special Correspondent), ''Hanover Evening Sun'', July 25, 1980, p. 10.</ref> (though in 1971 Ali himself invited the recent Soviet heavyweight champion Kamo Saroyan, who visited the United States, for a two-round bout.<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/68708470/ Ali Invites Russian To Go 2 Rounds (UPI,) ''Kingsport News'', January 7, 1971, 7-C.]</ref>) When aging Ali was going to [[Muhammad Ali vs. Larry Holmes|fight Larry Holmes]] in 1980, and Teofilo was making his way to the third gold medal in Moscow, Stevenson commented to the press that now it's Ali, who should have insisted on a three-four rounds fight.<ref name=\"Grimsley\" />\n\n{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote=\"Stevenson is a champion in all kinds of ways.

But the [[U.S. Treasury Department]] did not allow the series, saying that it violated terms of the [[U.S. embargo against Cuba]]. Apart from that attempt, Arum used a Jamaican promoter, Lucien Chen, as a mediator, to propose a $1 million fight against [[Leon Spinks]]. \"I envisioned a fight that would be attended by the two presidents, [[Fidel Castro]] and [[Jimmy Carter]],\" Chen said.<ref name=\"Brubaker\" />\n\nNevertheless, Stevenson's professional debut did never happen, because he remained loyal to the Cuban revolutionary ideals never accepting any payday for himself, no matter how big it appeared. After knocking out three opponents at the Munich Olympics in September 1972, including Duane Bobick of the United States, Stevenson was approached by an American promoter, who offered him $1 million to turn pro on the spot. \"I will not trade the Cuban people for all the dollars in the world,\" Stevenson was heard to say. \"Stevenson would have been phenomenal as a pro, he could have been in the same class as Muhammad Ali or Joe Frazier. But we'll never know,\" said Don King.<ref name=\"Brubaker\" />\n\n== Retirement and later years ==\nStevenson finished his sports career in 1988. He started to work as a boxing trainer and sports functionary. He worked at the National Institute for Sports, Physical Education, and Recreation (INDER,) also he served as vice president of the Cuban Boxing Federation.\n\nIn 1999, Stevenson was arrested for an altercation incident at [[Miami International Airport]] where, before boarding a [[United Airlines]] chartered jet of the Cuban national boxing team, he allegedly headbutted a 41-year-old [[United Airlines]] ticket counter employee, knocking him off several teeth in the process. According to Stevenson, an \"agitator\" approached him at the airport shouting insults against the Cuban government and other things, which are sensitive to any Cuban. Stevenson failed to attend the subsequent court proceedings, having travelled to Havana after his release from custody while on bail. The Cuban state newspaper ''[[Trabajadores]]'' blamed what it described as the \"[[Cuban diaspora in Miami|Miami mafia]]\" (i.e. Cuban exiles, whose vast diaspora reside in Florida) for provoking the incident, alleging that the [[Cuban American National Foundation]] organised a public gathering to abuse Stevenson when he returned to Miami airport after his arrest. The newspaper believed that the motives for the alleged provocation were somehow to cast a shadow upon a Cuban sports star.<ref>[http://www.cubanet.org/CNews/y99/nov99/09e7.htm Accused Cuban boxer provoked by insults to Castro] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004834/http://www.cubanet.org/CNews/y99/nov99/09e7.htm |date=27 September 2007 }} Reuters News</ref>\n\n== Death ==\nStevenson died on 11 June 2012 of a heart attack in [[Havana]] at the age of 60.<ref name = \"bbc death\"/> It was first reported by Cuban state media,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/11/world/americas/cuba-boxer-teofilo-stevenson-obit/index.html|author=Patrick Oppmann|title=Cuban boxing legend Teofilo Stevenson dead at 60|work=CNN|date=12 June 2012|accessdate=12 June 2012}}</ref> stating that \"the Cuban sporting family was moved today by the passing of one of the greatest of all time\".\n\nIt had been reported earlier by an anonymous sports official that Stevenson had suffered a heart attack.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://aol.sportingnews.com/olympics/story/2012-06-12/teofilo-stevenson-cuban-olympic-boxing-champion-dies-at-60|title=Teofilo Stevenson, Cuban Olympic boxing champion, dies at 60|agency=Associated Press|magazine=Sporting News|date=12 June 2012|accessdate=12 June 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130203014429/http://aol.sportingnews.com/olympics/story/2012-06-12/teofilo-stevenson-cuban-olympic-boxing-champion-dies-at-60|archivedate=3 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He is survived by his two children.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/sport-obituaries/9326538/Teofilo-Stevenson.html|author=Staff|title=Teofilo Stevenson|work=Telegraph|date=12 June 2012|accessdate=12 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nA forthcoming documentary by [[Brin-Jonathan Butler]], ''[[Split Decision (unreleased film)|Split Decision]]'', contains the last known interview with Stevenson.\n\n== Awards and honours ==\n* Stevenson was awarded the [[Val Barker Trophy]] for Outstanding Boxer at the 1972 [[Summer Olympic Games|Olympic]] Games.\n* In 1972, Stevenson became a [[Merited Master of Sport of the USSR]], one of a few foreign athletes to be awarded the title in its history.<ref name=\"Panorama\">{{cite book|title=Panorama of the 1972 Sports Year|year=1973|pages=122\u2013124|publisher=[[Fizkultura i sport (publisher)|Fizkultura i sport]]|location=Moscow|language=Russian}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.geocities.ws/pedrinet/stevenson.html Amateur career of Te\u00f3filo Stevenson] (in Spanish) compiled by Pedro Cabrera Isidr\u00f3n of the Cuban Olympics Committee.

1960s|1966]] to [[boxing in the 1980s|1986]]. He won the [[Val Barker Trophy]] (1972) and was honoured with the [[Olympic Order]] (1987). Stevenson is one of only three boxers to win three Olympic gold medals, alongside Hungarian [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Papp]] and fellow Cuban [[F\u00e9lix Sav\u00f3n]]. He might have become a five-time Olympic champion had the Cuban authorities allowed the Cuban boxing team to participate in the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]] and [[1988 Summer Olympics]], which they boycotted.<ref name=\"Hudson\">{{cite book |last= Hudson|first= David L.|date= 2009|title= Combat Sports: An Encyclopedia of Wrestling, Fighting, and Mixed Martial Arts|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LmhFCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA298|location= Westport, CT|publisher= Greenwood Press|pages= 298-299|isbn= 978-0-313-34383-4}}</ref><sup>[[#1984 and 1988 Summer Olympics|>]]</sup>\n\n== Early years ==\n\nStevenson was born in [[Puerto Padre]], Cuba.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.periodico26.cu/english/faces/stevenson.htm |title=Las Tunas-born Teofilo Stevenson: a Legend that Lives on |accessdate=2011-06-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820040414/http://www.periodico26.cu/english/faces/stevenson.htm |archivedate=20 August 2006 |df=dmy-all }}. Periodico.</ref> His father, Te\u00f3filo Stevenson Patterson, was an immigrant from [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]]. His mother Dolores Lawrence was a native [[Cubans|Cuban]], but her parents were immigrants from the [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] island of [[Saint Kitts]]. Te\u00f3filo senior arrived in Cuba in 1923, finding work wherever he could, before settling in [[Camag\u00fcey]] with Dolores, where he gave English lessons to top up his meagre earnings. Due to his large size, Te\u00f3filo senior was encouraged into boxing by local trainers, fighting seven times before becoming disillusioned by the corrupt payment structure on offer to young fighters.<ref name=\"young\">''In the Red Corner''. John Duncan. pp. 77\u201379.</ref>\n\nTe\u00f3filo junior was a shiftless but bright child who at nine years old soon found himself sparring at the makeshift open-air gym his father had frequented.<ref name=\"young\"/> Under the tutelage of former national light heavyweight champion John Herrera, Te\u00f3filo junior began his career fighting far more experienced boxers, but according to Herrera, \"had what it took\". Despite his growing involvement in the sport, Stevenson had yet to tell his mother about his activities. Eventually Te\u00f3filo Sr. broke the news to his wife, who was furious; but she agreed to acquiesce on the provision that the boy was accompanied by his father.<ref name=\"young\"/>\n\n==Boxing career==\n===Beginnings===\n\nThe young Stevenson continued to improve under Herrera in the mid 1960s, winning a junior title and gaining additional training in Havana. His victories drew the attention of Andrei Chervonenko, a head coach in Cuba's newly implemented state sports system. [[Professional sports]] throughout the island had been outlawed since 1962 by government resolution 83-A, and all boxing activity had come under the guidance of the government sponsored National Boxing Commission.<ref>[http://www.cubanet.org/CNews/y01/jun01/04e7.htm Cubans flex muscles in world of controversy / Independent News \u2013 Cuba News / Noticias \u2013 CubaNet News<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004940/http://www.cubanet.org/CNews/y01/jun01/04e7.htm |date=27 September 2007 }}</ref> Chervonenko, a retired boxer himself, sent by the [[Soviet Union]], who had created Cuba's ''Escuela de Boxeo'' (Boxing school) in a derelict old gym in Havana, began to champion Stevenson's progress.<ref>Duncan, p.79</ref>\n\nStevenson's senior boxing career began at age seventeen with a defeat in the national championships against the experienced heavyweight Gabriel Garcia. Despite the setback, Stevenson went on to register convincing victories over [[Nancio Carrillo]] and Juan Perez, two of Cuba's finest boxers in the weight division, securing a place in the national team for the 1970 Central American and Caribbean Boxing Championships. Defeat in the final after three victories was considered no shame, and Stevenson firmly established himself as Cuba's premier heavyweight. Back in the gym Chervonenko and leading Cuban boxing coach [[Alcides Sagarra]] worked on Stevenson's jab, which became his ultimate weapon, and paid dividends when the Cuban easily defeated East Germany's [[Bernd Anders]] in front of a surprised Berlin crowd. The victory made the entire amateur boxing world take notice of Stevenson as a serious heavyweight contender.<ref>Duncan, p-80-81</ref>\n\n===Munich Olympics 1972===\nStevenson, now twenty, joined the Cuban boxing team for the [[1972 Summer Olympics|Munich Olympics of 1972]]. His opening bout against experienced Polish fighter [[Ludwik Denderys]] began dramatically when Stevenson knocked the other man down within thirty seconds of the opening bell. The fight was stopped moments later due to a large cut next to the Pole's eye.\n\nProceeding to the quarter finals, Stevenson met American boxer [[Duane Bobick]]. Bobick, a gold medalist at the [[Boxing at the 1971 Pan American Games|1971 Pan American Games]], had beaten Stevenson previously. After a close first round, Stevenson lost the second, but a ferocious display in the third round knocked Bobick to the canvas three times and the contest was stopped. The victory was viewed on television throughout Cuba, and is still considered Stevenson's most memorable performance.\n\nStevenson easily defeated German [[Peter Hussing]] in the semifinal by TKO in the 2nd round, and received his gold medal after Romanian [[Ion Alexe]] failed to appear in the final due to injury. The Cuban boxing team won three gold medals, their first in Olympic boxing history, as well as one silver and one bronze. The Munich games established Cuba's dominance over the amateur sport that was to last decades. It also established Stevenson as the world's premier amateur heavyweight boxer.\n\nLess than two years after his successful performance at the Munich Olympics, Stevenson, then 22-year-old, was rewarded with a house for himself in Havana and another for himself and his family in [[Delicias, Cuba|Delicias]]. Stevenson later recalled: \"I had no idea the house in Delicias was going to be so big. When I was shown the plans, I said, \u2018What is this? A bunker?\u2019\" AIBA President [[Anwar Chowdhry]], when asked did the Cuban authorities acted properly in giving Stevenson two houses and two cars, said: \"These things should not be allowed. If gifts are to be given it should be for everybody\u2014not for a few.\" Over tea in his office in Havana's [[Sports City Coliseum]], INDER President Conrado Mart\u00ednez Corona defended the local practice of giving cars and apartments to top athletes. \"Our country has the obligation of solving the problems of all citizens\u2014the problems of their nourishment, housing, education and health,\" he said. \"It's a pity we can't solve this problem in the way we need to for everybody.\"<ref name=\"Brubaker\">{{cite journal |last= Brubaker|first= Bill|author-link= Bill Brubaker|date= February 21, 1986|title= A Boxer to Whom Money Didn't Talk|journal= [[The Washington Post]]|pages= A1}}</ref>\n\n===Prime years===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Teofilo Stevenson wins.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Te\u00f3filo Stevenson wins over Piotr Zaev]] -->\nStevenson did the same at the inaugural [[1974 World Amateur Boxing Championships|1974 World Championships]] in [[Havana, Cuba]], and then in the [[1976 Summer Olympics]], held in [[Montreal]], Stevenson repeated the feat once again.

This fight ended an eleven-year unbeaten run by Stevenson and was the only occasion that he did not win the gold medal at the World Championships when he entered the competition.\n\nHiss loss by a split decision to Aleksandr Lukstin of the Soviet Union in the finals of the 1983 C\u00f3rdova Card\u00edn, as the Soviet head coach Kontsantin Koptsev later admitted, was due to a plaster-like tape they [[Hand wrap|handwrapped]] Lukstin's fists instead of a regular elastic-band hand wrapping.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW3NN7YY4cM&t=1804 \u0422\u0435\u0440\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0431\u043e\u043a\u0441\u0430 - \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0439 \u041a\u0443\u0440\u043d\u044f\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043d \u041a\u043e\u043f\u0446\u0435\u0432 (\u0412\u044b\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a 28)] (in Russian)</ref>\n\nStevenson might have won a fourth gold medal at the [[1984 Summer Olympics]], but the [[Soviet Union]] boycotted the games, which were hosted by Los Angeles, in retaliation for the American boycott of the 1980 Moscow competition. Cuba followed the Soviet lead, and Stevenson did not compete.<ref name = \"bbc death\"/> For consolation, he beat future Olympic champion [[Tyrell Biggs]] in February 1984 (breaking three ribs in a process) and won the super heavyweight gold at the [[Boxing at the Friendship Games|1984 Friendship Games]], defeating [[Ulli Kaden]] of [[East Germany]] and, in the final, Valeriy Abadzhyan of the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://amateur-boxing.strefa.pl/Championships/OlympicGames1984FT.html|title=Friendhips Tournament - Havana, Cuba - August 18-24 1984|publisher=amateur-boxing.strefa.pl |date= |accessdate=2019-03-05}}</ref>\nAt the [[1986 World Amateur Boxing Championships]], he won the super heavyweight gold, defeating [[Alex Garcia (boxer)|Alex Garcia]] from the United States in the final. Stevenson retired from boxing shortly after the [[1988 Summer Olympics]], which Cuba also boycotted.<ref name = \"bbc death\"/>\n\n=== Rivalry with Vysotsky ===\nTe\u00f3filo Stevenson was known for two fights with Soviet boxer [[Igor Vysotsky]], who defeated Stevenson twice. Vysotsky later revealed in his interview to ''East Side Boxing'':<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=9323&more=1|title=SOVIET LEGENDS: Igor Vysotsky \u2013 The man who had Teofilo Stevenson\u2019s number!\" ESB EXCLUSIVE Interview!|last=Komarnitzky|first=Gennadiy|author2=Koza, Izyaslav |date=24 December 2006|publisher=East Side Boxing}}</ref>\n{{quote|text=I fought Teofilo twice.

Although the score was 3:2, the pace of the fight forced Te\u00f3filo to take two necessary breaks to retie his gloves. We had a saying in the USSR, \u201cIt\u2019s easier to win the World championships than it is to win \u2018C\u00f3rdova Card\u00edn\u2019.\u201d The second time was at a class A International tournament in [[Minsk]], in March 1976. In each stanza, Stevenson took a count, while in the final three minutes, I knocked him out. |sign=Igor Vysotsky|source=Interview with ''East Side Boxing'', 2006}}\n\nVysotsky was the only boxer out of hundreds of Stevenson's opponents to ever stop him, let alone by knockout, and to defeat him twice, both times in his prime, without being avenged. And on top of it, Vysotsky scored his first victory over Stevenson at the C\u00f3rdova Card\u00edn, Cubans' home tournament, where they do their best to never let any foreigner get into the finals.\n\nStevenson's second loss to Vysotsky happened six weeks before his knockout winning streak at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal, which ended up with a victories over [[John Tate (boxer)|John Tate]] and [[Mircea \u0218imon]].

Stevenson was often dubbed by the American media as the Ali's \"Communist twin,\" speculations went back and forth as to their much anticipated fight if Te\u00f3 would accept offer to turn pro (which in essence meant to defect and to leave Cuba permanently.) Along with [[Pete Rademacher]], he was the only amateur boxer who was offered a shot at the world's heavyweight title in his potential pro debut. Eventually Ali will spend one week in Cuba with Stevenson, but their matchup would never happen.<ref name=\"Brubaker\" /> Stevenson, when he finally met Ali, suggested to Ali to arrange a three-four rounds fight. Muhammad refused to do it in Teofilo's way, implying he would face him off in a standard 15-rounds championship bout, in which he would have an edge by outlasting his opponent<ref name=\"Grimsley\">[https://newspaperarchive.com/hanover-evening-sun-jul-25-1980-p-10/ Cuban Heavyweight Looks For 3rd Gold] by Will Grimsley (AP Special Correspondent), ''Hanover Evening Sun'', July 25, 1980, p. 10.</ref> (though in 1971 Ali himself invited the recent Soviet heavyweight champion Kamo Saroyan, who visited the United States, for a two-round bout.<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/68708470/ Ali Invites Russian To Go 2 Rounds (UPI,) ''Kingsport News'', January 7, 1971, 7-C.</ref>) When aging Ali was going to [[Muhammad Ali vs. Larry Holmes|fight Larry Holmes]] in 1980, and Teofilo was making his way to the third gold medal in Moscow, Stevenson commented to the press that now it's Ali, who should have insisted on a three-four rounds fight.<ref name=\"Grimsley\" />\n\n{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote=\"Stevenson is a champion in all kinds of ways.

But the [[U.S. Treasury Department]] did not allow the series, saying that it violated terms of the [[U.S. embargo against Cuba]]. Apart from that attempt, Arum used a Jamaican promoter, Lucien Chen, as a mediator, to propose a $1 million fight against [[Leon Spinks]]. \"I envisioned a fight that would be attended by the two presidents, [[Fidel Castro]] and [[Jimmy Carter]],\" Chen said.<ref name=\"Brubaker\" />\n\nNevertheless, Stevenson's professional debut did never happen, because he remained loyal to the Cuban revolutionary ideals never accepting any payday for himself, no matter how big it appeared. After knocking out three opponents at the Munich Olympics in September 1972, including Duane Bobick of the United States, Stevenson was approached by an American promoter, who offered him $1 million to turn pro on the spot. \"I will not trade the Cuban people for all the dollars in the world,\" Stevenson was heard to say. \"Stevenson would have been phenomenal as a pro, he could have been in the same class as Muhammad Ali or Joe Frazier. But we'll never know,\" said Don King.<ref name=\"Brubaker\" />\n\n== Retirement and later years ==\nStevenson finished his sports career in 1988. He started to work as a boxing trainer and sports functionary. He worked at the National Institute for Sports, Physical Education, and Recreation (INDER,) also he served as vice president of the Cuban Boxing Federation.\n\nIn 1999, Stevenson was arrested for an altercation incident at [[Miami International Airport]] where, before boarding a [[United Airlines]] chartered jet of the Cuban national boxing team, he allegedly headbutted a 41-year-old [[United Airlines]] ticket counter employee, knocking him off several teeth in the process. According to Stevenson, an \"agitator\" approached him at the airport shouting insults against the Cuban government and other things, which are sensitive to any Cuban. Stevenson failed to attend the subsequent court proceedings, having travelled to Havana after his release from custody while on bail. The Cuban state newspaper ''[[Trabajadores]]'' blamed what it described as the \"[[Cuban diaspora in Miami|Miami mafia]]\" (i.e. Cuban exiles, whose vast diaspora reside in Florida) for provoking the incident, alleging that the [[Cuban American National Foundation]] organised a public gathering to abuse Stevenson when he returned to Miami airport after his arrest. The newspaper believed that the motives for the alleged provocation were somehow to cast a shadow upon a Cuban sports star.<ref>[http://www.cubanet.org/CNews/y99/nov99/09e7.htm Accused Cuban boxer provoked by insults to Castro] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004834/http://www.cubanet.org/CNews/y99/nov99/09e7.htm |date=27 September 2007 }} Reuters News</ref>\n\n== Death ==\nStevenson died on 11 June 2012 of a heart attack in [[Havana]] at the age of 60.<ref name = \"bbc death\"/> It was first reported by Cuban state media,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/11/world/americas/cuba-boxer-teofilo-stevenson-obit/index.html|author=Patrick Oppmann|title=Cuban boxing legend Teofilo Stevenson dead at 60|work=CNN|date=12 June 2012|accessdate=12 June 2012}}</ref> stating that \"the Cuban sporting family was moved today by the passing of one of the greatest of all time\".\n\nIt had been reported earlier by an anonymous sports official that Stevenson had suffered a heart attack.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://aol.sportingnews.com/olympics/story/2012-06-12/teofilo-stevenson-cuban-olympic-boxing-champion-dies-at-60|title=Teofilo Stevenson, Cuban Olympic boxing champion, dies at 60|agency=Associated Press|magazine=Sporting News|date=12 June 2012|accessdate=12 June 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130203014429/http://aol.sportingnews.com/olympics/story/2012-06-12/teofilo-stevenson-cuban-olympic-boxing-champion-dies-at-60|archivedate=3 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He is survived by his two children.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/sport-obituaries/9326538/Teofilo-Stevenson.html|author=Staff|title=Teofilo Stevenson|work=Telegraph|date=12 June 2012|accessdate=12 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nA forthcoming documentary by [[Brin-Jonathan Butler]], ''[[Split Decision (unreleased film)|Split Decision]]'', contains the last known interview with Stevenson.\n\n== Awards and honours ==\n* Stevenson was awarded the [[Val Barker Trophy]] for Outstanding Boxer at the 1972 [[Summer Olympic Games|Olympic]] Games.\n* In 1972, Stevenson became a [[Merited Master of Sport of the USSR]], one of a few foreign athletes to be awarded the title in its history.<ref name=\"Panorama\">{{cite book|title=Panorama of the 1972 Sports Year|year=1973|pages=122\u2013124|publisher=[[Fizkultura i sport (publisher)|Fizkultura i sport]]|location=Moscow|language=Russian}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.geocities.ws/pedrinet/stevenson.html Amateur career of Te\u00f3filo Stevenson] (in Spanish) compiled by Pedro Cabrera Isidr\u00f3n of the Cuban Olympics Committee.

Director Irving Reis was a novice, and co-star [[Henry Fonda]], a former boyfriend on loan from [[20th Century Fox]], did not offer her much guidance. Fearing his wife might rekindle her relationship with Fonda, [[Desi Arnaz]] frequently lingered on the set. Despite these obstacles, Ball considered the film her favorite.<ref name=\"TCM\"/>\n\nThe vocals for \"Who Knows?\" by [[Harry Revel]] and Mort Greene, performed by Gloria in Case's [[Manhattan]] club, were provided by [[Martha Mears]]. The character later reprises the song with [[Ozzie Nelson]] and his orchestra in the Miami nightspot.\n\nThe character of Nicely Nicely Johnson appears in the Broadway musical ''[[Guys and Dolls]]'', as well as the film. [[Sam Levene]] hits the bulls-eye of comic relief in the role of Horsethief, an erudite gambler, a pre-cursor to Levene's legendary Broadway performance as the \"craps-shooter extraordinaire\" [[Nathan Detroit]] in the 1950 original Broadway production of ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]'' (1950), which ran for 1,200 performances on Broadway.\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe film critic for the ''New York Times'' called the film \"smartly paced and colorful\" and \"crisply directed\" but thought \"in deviating occasionally from the plot's general comedy lines, the film over-dramatizes some none too plausible situations with an effect which is sometimes maudlin.\" He noted Henry Fonda \"makes an acutely sympathetic hero opposite Miss Ball's able portrayal of the singer.\"<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A02E7D8113CE33BBC4C52DFBE668389659EDE ''New York Times'' review]</ref>\n\n''Variety'' wrote that screenwriter Leonard Spigelgass did \"a neat job of transferring the spirit of the piece to the screen, studding it with typical Runyon humor,\" and felt Lucille Ball \"comes through with high laurels\" and Henry Fonda \"is at his best.\"<ref>[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117789256.html?categoryid=31&cs=1 ''Variety'' review]</ref>\n\n''Time Out London'' wrote that the film \"captures much of [Runyon's] low-life spirit and colorful vernacular, but occasionally spoils it all by wallowing in unnecessary sentimentality\" and added \"Ball, in a rare straight role, is stunning.\"<ref>[http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/67805/the_big_street.html ''Time Out London'' review] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221214326/http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/67805/the_big_street.html |date=February 21, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==DVD release==\n[[Turner Home Entertainment]] released the film on Region 1 DVD on June 19, 2007.
