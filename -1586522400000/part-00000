Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first ''jamaat'' of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi.<ref name=womenbm/> Accompanied by a close male relative, (''[[mahram]]'', \u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645), women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands.<ref name=daily/><ref name=womenbm/> ''Jamaats'' of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nIn many modern Islamist movements, women have been relegated to a domestic role.{{fact|date=April 2020}} Tablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook during the course of ''da'wa'' tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household.<ref name=womenbm/> Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement,<ref name=daily/> but their opinions are taken into due considerations. Women and the family members are being to told to learn Quran and follow 5 Amaals in every day life, Taleem of Ahadees, Quran recitation,6 Points muzakera, and mashwara for daily life work and fikr for the whole world as people from around the world will be coming and they are the one who has to learn before they teach.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\n==Controversies==\n[[File:Cot Goh.jpg|thumb|Mushawara after Bayan Subh at Tablighi Jamaat center in Cot Goh, [[Montasik]], [[Aceh Besar]], [[Aceh]]]]\n\n===Criticism===\nDue to the orthodox nature of Tablighi Jamaat, they have been criticised for being retrogressive. The women in the movement observe complete [[hijab]] for which the Tablighi Jamaat is accused of keeping women \"strictly subservient and second string\".<ref name=daily/>\n\nTablighi Jamaat has also been criticised within Islamic circles and the major opposition in the Indian subcontinent comes from the [[Barelvi]] movement. One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on ''da'wa'' tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nMany critics, especially those from [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]], criticise Tabligh Jamaat for their neutral political stance. They say that Islamist forces, during their conflicts with secular or non-Islamist opponents, could have been helped by Tablighi Jamaat followers. Specifically they criticise the Tabligh Jamaat's neutral position towards issues in South Asia such as the introduction of an [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|Islamic constitution in Pakistan]] (1950s), Islam vs Socialism (1969\u20131971), communal riots in India in the 1970s and 1980s, the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement (1974), and [[Tehreek Nizam-e-Mustafa|Nizam-e-Mustafa Movement]] (1977).<ref name=AMFO1994:518>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=518}}</ref> The Tablighi Jamaat, in response, states that it is only by avoiding the political debates that the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jamestown.org/program/growing-islamic-state-influence-in-pakistan-fuels-sectarian-violence/|title=Growing Islamic State Influence in Pakistan Fuels Sectarian Violence|website=Jamestown|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref><ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements.

Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first ''jamaat'' of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi.<ref name=womenbm/> Accompanied by a close male relative, (''[[mahram]]'', \u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645), women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands.<ref name=daily/><ref name=womenbm/> ''Jamaats'' of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nIn many modern Islamist movements, women have been relegated to a domestic role.{{fact|date=April 2020}} Tablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook during the course of ''da'wa'' tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household.<ref name=womenbm/> Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement,<ref name=daily/> but their opinions are taken into due considerations.

The women in the movement observe complete [[hijab]] for which the Tablighi Jamaat is accused of keeping women \"strictly subservient and second string\".<ref name=daily/>\n\nTablighi Jamaat has also been criticised within Islamic circles and the major opposition in the Indian subcontinent comes from the [[Barelvi]] movement. One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on ''da'wa'' tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nMany critics, especially those from [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]], criticise Tabligh Jamaat for their neutral political stance. They say that Islamist forces, during their conflicts with secular or non-Islamist opponents, could have been helped by Tablighi Jamaat followers. Specifically they criticise the Tabligh Jamaat's neutral position towards issues in South Asia such as the introduction of an [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|Islamic constitution in Pakistan]] (1950s), Islam vs Socialism (1969\u20131971), communal riots in India in the 1970s and 1980s, the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement (1974), and [[Tehreek Nizam-e-Mustafa|Nizam-e-Mustafa Movement]] (1977).<ref name=AMFO1994:518>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=518}}</ref> The Tablighi Jamaat, in response, states that it is only by avoiding the political debates that the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jamestown.org/program/growing-islamic-state-influence-in-pakistan-fuels-sectarian-violence/|title=Growing Islamic State Influence in Pakistan Fuels Sectarian Violence|website=Jamestown|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref><ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement for the establishment of an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order.<ref name=AMFO1994:519>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=519}}</ref> The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals.

He served as a Defence Minister during the [[Korean War]].<ref name=bbc000421/>\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nIn 1891, he was born in [[Uiryeong]], [[Gyeongsang-do]], [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] (now [[Uiryeong]], [[Gyeongsangnam-do]], [[South Korea]]), as the son of Jae rok Lee. In 1907, he entered the night class at the Department of Law at Bosung College, and graduated from Boseong Law College in 1910 (4 years in Yonghee). In August 1910, he fled to [[Vladivostok]] and joined into the [[Korean independence movemen|anti-Japanese independence movement]] under the guidance of Shin Chae-ho and his hometown leader, Ahn Hee-je.\n\nFrom 1930, he became the captain of a regular ferry to and from London and India. When the Korean Liberation Army was established in September 1940, the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea made a special appointment to him as a military commissioner. During [[World War II]], it was known in Korea that he was surviving around May 1948 after giving up his return and taking office as an adviser to an Indian merchant ship company.\n\n====Political activity====\nHe returned to Korea in 1948. On December 19, 1949, he was invited to the Supreme Council of the Korean Youth.<ref>[http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=B&i=124315&v=42 \ub300\ud55c\uccad\ub144\ub2e8' - \ub124\uc774\ud2b8 \ubc31\uacfc\uc0ac\uc804]</ref> After that, he served as the head of the Korea Youth Team and advisory committee of the Ministry of Transportation, in 1949 he served as the second Minister of Home Affairs ({{lang-ko|\ub300\ud55c\ubbfc\uad6d \ub0b4\ubb34\ubd80}}).

It is traditionally held over Easter weekend each year.\n\nAfter Terry Rogers death in 1999 the tournament, originally held in Dublin's [[Eccentric Club]], was subsequently hosted by tournament director and poker player [[Liam Flood]] and the Merrion Casino<ref>https://pokerdb.thehendonmob.com/player.php?a=b&n=90031</ref>.\n\npaddypowerpoker.com began sponsorship of the event in 2005 and oversaw the huge growth in the tournament. By 2006 the event, with 339 players, had outgrown the Merrion Casino and was held in Jury's Ballsbridge Hotel in Dublin. In 2007 the venue was changed to the Burlington Hotel, Dublin to accommodate the bigger field, while in 2008 and 2009 the Irish Open venue was Citywest Hotel, Dublin.  In 2010 the tournament returned to the Burlington Hotel and numbers declined year on year up to 2015 which was inline with trends and decline in the online poker industry.\n\nIn 2016, the Irish Poker Open returned to Citywest Hotel for a week long festival from 21 to 28 March, culminating in the \u20ac500k Main Event. The 2016 Irish Poker Open was managed by JP Poker and Countside Ltd, both companies have organised tournaments in both Ireland and Europe for the last 20 years.\n\nDue to the ongoing [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|Covid-19 pandemic]], the 2020 Irish Poker Open is [[online poker|being staged online]].<ref>https://www.pokernews.com/news/2020/03/partypoker-to-the-rescue-2020-irish-open-now-online-36803.htm</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n<!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Terry, Irene and Jim Heffernan.JPG|frame|right|Terry Rogers with 1985 Irish Open Champion Irene Tier and Jim Heffernan]] -->\n\nTerry Rogers once declared \"I have been the greatest single factor in the worldwide spread of competitive poker.\"<ref name=\"cplayer\">[http://www.cardplayer.com/author/article/europe/210/6414 Cardplayer Europe: How the Irish Changed the Face of Poker]</ref>\n\nOne of his most enduring legacies was founding the Irish Open. In the late 1970s Terry started to hold poker tournaments for charity under the auspices of the [[Eccentric Club]]. According to Liam Flood, a fellow [[bookmaker]] and friend of Terry's the games would get \"anywhere between 100 and 300 players playing [[five-card draw]] for \u00a3100 to \u00a3200 per game. That was a lot of people for that kind of money at the time. Every year Terry would go to [[United States|America]] on business. In May 1979 he had a few days off and went to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. He saw this high stakes poker game going on and met [[Benny Binion]] and the rest is history.\"<ref name=\"cplayer\"/>\n\nAlways one to spot an opportunity Rogers cemented his relationship with Binion and his band of high-rolling players by taking bets from them on the outcome of the games, offering the type of long odds the Americans had never seen before.\n\n\u201cGuys like [[Benny Binion]], [[Doyle Brunson]] and [[Chip Reese]] really held Terry in high esteem,\" states [[World Series of Poker]] bracelet winner and former Irish Olympic swimmer [[Donnacha O'Dea]]. \"He\u2019d give them great odds, better than any American bookie would give, but he still made sure he had a 20% edge.\"<ref name=\"cplayer\"/>\n\nAfter the 1979 World Series Terry returned to Ireland enthused about what he\u2019d seen. Stud and draw were the poker variants of choice in Ireland but the new variation he\u2019d seen in Vegas, no-limit hold\u2019em, beat them all for excitement and skill.\n\nIn the following years he returned to Vegas for the World Series with [[Liam Flood]] but his bookmaking activities brought the attention of the [[Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department|Las Vegas Police Department]] and on one occasion Terry and Liam ended up being arrested and imprisoned. The irony of being jailed for gambling in Vegas was not lost on them according to Flood.<ref name=\"cplayer\"/>\n\n==Development==\nThe Irish Open was organised under the auspices of the charity fundraising organisation started by Terry called the Eccentric Club. It attracted mainly local players but Rogers already had his eye on expanding the event.\n\nDonnacha O'Dea remembers the stunts Rogers pulled to generate interest in the Irish Open. \"He\u2019d publicise betting on the tournament in the Racing Post along with an event such as the Super Bowl so he could get around the law on advertising such events. He\u2019d install an outsider such as \u2018Suitcase\u2019 Johnny as favourite. Poker players would then see these odds and think to themselves, \u2018Well I\u2019m much better than this guy who's favourite\u2019 and immediately want to take part in the tournament.\"<ref name=\"cplayer\"/>\n\nThe Irish Open fell into abeyance in the early 1990s as Terry concentrated on nursing his mother through ill health. It was resurrected again in the mid-1990s.\n\n==Relationship with the World Series of Poker==\nTerry's annual trips to Las Vegas and the success of the first Irish Open led to the US players he had befriended at the World Series of Poker repaying their debt of gratitude for his generous bookmaking services by making a rare excursion from their home soil to play in Ireland in 1982 and 1983.\n\nDonnacha and Liam remember the American invasions with glee. \"One year Terry got them a yellow Rolls Royce for when they arrived at the airport. Another year he arrived with a white horse which Amarillo Slim, who was a real horseman, rode out of the airport.\n\n\u201cThose years he had [[Tom McEvoy]], [[Jack Keller (poker player)|Jack Keller]], [[Stu Ungar]], Doyle Brunson, Chip Reese, and [[Perry Green (poker player)|Perry Green]] from [[Alaska]]. It was funny to see them try to pay for goods in [[Killiney]] village with chips from Terry's poker tournament, something they were used to doing in Vegas.\"<ref name=\"cplayer\"/>\n\n==Irish Open 2007==\nThe Irish Poker Open 2007 Main Event had a guaranteed prize pool of \u20ac2&nbsp;million \u2013 twice the \u20ac1&nbsp;million guarantee of 2006 but with a then-European record 708 players the prize pool swelled to more than \u20ac2.3&nbsp;million.\n\nThe final table of six was made up of four Irishmen, an Englishman and a Canadian. The winner, [[Belfast]] man [[Marty Smyth]], took home the \u20ac650,000 first prize after a two-hour heads-up battle against World Poker Tour and European Poker Tour winner [[Roland De Wolfe]].

It is traditionally held over Easter weekend each year.\n\nAfter Terry Rogers death in 1999 the tournament, originally held in Dublin's [[Eccentric Club]], was subsequently hosted by tournament director and poker player [[Liam Flood]] and the Merrion Casino<ref>https://pokerdb.thehendonmob.com/player.php?a=b&n=90031</ref>.\n\npaddypowerpoker.com began sponsorship of the event in 2005 and oversaw the huge growth in the tournament. By 2006 the event, with 339 players, had outgrown the Merrion Casino and was held in Jury's Ballsbridge Hotel in Dublin. In 2007 the venue was changed to the Burlington Hotel, Dublin to accommodate the bigger field, while in 2008 and 2009 the Irish Open venue was Citywest Hotel, Dublin.  In 2010 the tournament returned to the Burlington Hotel and numbers declined year on year up to 2015 which was inline with trends and decline in the online poker industry.\n\nIn 2016, the Irish Poker Open returned to Citywest Hotel for a week long festival from 21 to 28 March, culminating in the \u20ac500k Main Event. The 2016 Irish Poker Open was managed by JP Poker and Countside Ltd, both companies have organised tournaments in both Ireland and Europe for the last 20 years.\n\nDue to the ongoing [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|Covid-19 pandemic]], the 2020 Irish Poker Open is [[online poker|being staged online]].<ref>https://www.pokernews.com/news/2020/03/partypoker-to-the-rescue-2020-irish-open-now-online-36803.htm</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n<!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Terry, Irene and Jim Heffernan.JPG|frame|right|Terry Rogers with 1985 Irish Open Champion Irene Tier and Jim Heffernan]] -->\n\nTerry Rogers once declared \"I have been the greatest single factor in the worldwide spread of competitive poker.\"<ref name=\"cplayer\">[http://www.cardplayer.com/author/article/europe/210/6414 Cardplayer Europe: How the Irish Changed the Face of Poker]</ref>\n\nOne of his most enduring legacies was founding the Irish Open. In the late 1970s Terry started to hold poker tournaments for charity under the auspices of the [[Eccentric Club]]. According to Liam Flood, a fellow [[bookmaker]] and friend of Terry's the games would get \"anywhere between 100 and 300 players playing [[five-card draw]] for \u00a3100 to \u00a3200 per game. That was a lot of people for that kind of money at the time. Every year Terry would go to [[United States|America]] on business. In May 1979 he had a few days off and went to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. He saw this high stakes poker game going on and met [[Benny Binion]] and the rest is history.\"<ref name=\"cplayer\"/>\n\nAlways one to spot an opportunity Rogers cemented his relationship with Binion and his band of high-rolling players by taking bets from them on the outcome of the games, offering the type of long odds the Americans had never seen before.\n\n\u201cGuys like [[Benny Binion]], [[Doyle Brunson]] and [[Chip Reese]] really held Terry in high esteem,\" states [[World Series of Poker]] bracelet winner and former Irish Olympic swimmer [[Donnacha O'Dea]]. \"He\u2019d give them great odds, better than any American bookie would give, but he still made sure he had a 20% edge.\"<ref name=\"cplayer\"/>\n\nAfter the 1979 World Series Terry returned to Ireland enthused about what he\u2019d seen. Stud and draw were the poker variants of choice in Ireland but the new variation he\u2019d seen in Vegas, no-limit hold\u2019em, beat them all for excitement and skill.\n\nIn the following years he returned to Vegas for the World Series with [[Liam Flood]] but his bookmaking activities brought the attention of the [[Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department|Las Vegas Police Department]] and on one occasion Terry and Liam ended up being arrested and imprisoned. The irony of being jailed for gambling in Vegas was not lost on them according to Flood.<ref name=\"cplayer\"/>\n\n==Development==\nThe Irish Open was organised under the auspices of the charity fundraising organisation started by Terry called the Eccentric Club. It attracted mainly local players but Rogers already had his eye on expanding the event.\n\nDonnacha O'Dea remembers the stunts Rogers pulled to generate interest in the Irish Open. \"He\u2019d publicise betting on the tournament in the Racing Post along with an event such as the Super Bowl so he could get around the law on advertising such events. He\u2019d install an outsider such as \u2018Suitcase\u2019 Johnny as favourite. Poker players would then see these odds and think to themselves, \u2018Well I\u2019m much better than this guy who's favourite\u2019 and immediately want to take part in the tournament.\"<ref name=\"cplayer\"/>\n\nThe Irish Open fell into abeyance in the early 1990s as Terry concentrated on nursing his mother through ill health. It was resurrected again in the mid-1990s.\n\n==Relationship with the World Series of Poker==\nTerry's annual trips to Las Vegas and the success of the first Irish Open led to the US players he had befriended at the World Series of Poker repaying their debt of gratitude for his generous bookmaking services by making a rare excursion from their home soil to play in Ireland in 1982 and 1983.\n\nDonnacha and Liam remember the American invasions with glee. \"One year Terry got them a yellow Rolls Royce for when they arrived at the airport. Another year he arrived with a white horse which Amarillo Slim, who was a real horseman, rode out of the airport.\n\n\u201cThose years he had [[Tom McEvoy]], [[Jack Keller (poker player)|Jack Keller]], [[Stu Ungar]], Doyle Brunson, Chip Reese, and [[Perry Green (poker player)|Perry Green]] from [[Alaska]]. It was funny to see them try to pay for goods in [[Killiney]] village with chips from Terry's poker tournament, something they were used to doing in Vegas.\"<ref name=\"cplayer\"/>\n\n==Irish Open 2007==\nThe Irish Poker Open 2007 Main Event had a guaranteed prize pool of \u20ac2&nbsp;million \u2013 twice the \u20ac1&nbsp;million guarantee of 2006 but with a then-European record 708 players the prize pool swelled to more than \u20ac2.3&nbsp;million.\n\nThe final table of six was made up of four Irishmen, an Englishman and a Canadian. The winner, [[Belfast]] man [[Marty Smyth]], took home the \u20ac650,000 first prize after a two-hour heads-up battle against World Poker Tour and European Poker Tour winner [[Roland De Wolfe]].
