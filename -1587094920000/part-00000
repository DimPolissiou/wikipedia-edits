In 2015, she began recording the album with bassist [[Sebastian Steinberg]], drummer Amy Aileen Wood and guitarist [[Dav\u00edd Garza]].<ref name=\"newyorker\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity|title=Fiona Apple's Art of Radical Sensitivity|last=Nussbaum|first=Emily|author-link=Emily Nussbaum|website=[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]|date=March 16, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThey began recording in Apple's [[Venice Beach]] home studio, using home-made percussive objects and chanting  as they marched around the house. They spent three weeks at the [[Sonic Ranch]] studio in rural Texas, with little success. Upon returning to Venice Beach, they began making progress, with Apple recording long takes consisting of instruments being hit against surfaces and objects. Apple's vocals were unedited, and the album developed a highly percussive sound.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/>\n\nBy July 2019, Apple had begun mixing the album. In September, the process began to slow down, with Apple developing doubts about the album.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> At this time, the artist first mentioned work on her new project in an interview with ''[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]'', explaining that she was still working hard on her next album which should have been released \"a million years ago\" and was hoping to put it out in 2020. She also admitted to being reclusive due to ongoing recording sessions at her Venice Beach house.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/fiona-apple-is-still-calling-bullshit.html|title=Fiona Apple Is Still Calling Bullshit|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]|date=September 25, 2019|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2020, she played the mixes to her band members, whose positive response brought Apple back on track.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> In an interview that month, she said that the album process was in its final stages, with the only things left being \"artwork and stuff\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-soon/|title=Fiona Apple says new album will \"be done soon\"|last=Bacior|first=Robin|website=Consequence of Sound|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-updates.html|title=15 Minutes With Fiona Apple|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=Vulture|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> On March 9, 2020, she revealed that she had finished recording, making the announcement in sign language.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/fiona-apple-reveals-her-new-album-is-finished-2622233|title=Fiona Apple reveals her new album is finished|last=Langford|first=Jackson|website=NME|date=March 9, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\nThe album's sound is percussive and raw. Songs feature looped sections, and sudden tempo changes. Apple's long-time bassist [[Sebastian Steinberg]] compared the album to Apple's 2012 song \"Hot Knife\", describing it as \"very raw and unslick\".

The software is utilised at both ends of the market, by small consultancies and global engineering consultants, research institutions and is utilised by many highly respected educational institutions worldwide in both civil and geotechnical engineering courses. DIANA is equipped with very powerful solvers which enables the analysis of a wide range of structures, large and small - with basic or advanced analyses. A large selection of material models, element libraries and analysis procedures are available within the package which gives DIANA a large degree of flexibility. The main fields of use of DIANA include design and analysis of dams & dikes; tunnels & underground structures; oil & gas<ref>{{cite book|title=DIANA Computational Mechanics '94|year=1994|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=978-94-010-4454-7|pages=339\u2013348|author=Endal.

The initial idea had been to develop an in-house code for consultancy work in the field of concrete mechanics and civil engineering. This code was based on the displacement method, and was called \u201cDIANA\u201d \u2013 an acronym for '''DI'''splacement '''ANA'''lyser. \nBy 1975, DIANA was being used for the analysis of a number of complex off-shore structures in the Netherlands. Experience gained from these projects led to the realisation that in order to model, mesh and analyse large reinforced concrete structures in a streamlined fashion (and within one package), a huge amount of processing power would be required. At that point TNO started to invest in not only developing the DIANA software but also in the purchase of, what was then, up to the minute computing equipment. In the following years, TNO continued to expand the limitations of the DIANA software, introducing MESH for automatic mesh generation and GRAPHI to display the model and analysis results. In 1977, DIANA was used to analyse parts of the [[Oosterscheldekering|Oosterschelde Deltawerken]] in Zeeland, the Netherlands. By this time, the amount of time required to carry out analyses had significantly decreased, and DIANA was becoming increasingly recognised for its capabilities.\n\n===1980s to 1990s===\nThe first release of DIANA, \u201cDIANA-1\u201d, was made available to the Ministry of Public Works in the Hague ([[Rijkswaterstaat]]) in 1980. The result of this and more sales, further funding and development took place and in 1984 the [http://www.dianausers.nl/eng/ DIANA Users Association] was established. This users forum was established to, and continues to, provide an exchange of users experience and indicate development priorities to TNO (now to DIANA FEA BV). Release 2.0 of DIANA was made available in 1988, this included new modules for potential flow analysis and connection to external pre/post processors. For the first time users manuals, course books and text books were made available in English \u2013 this quickly led to the first sales of DIANA outside of the Netherlands. In 1989, the DIANA Foundation was formed, members included TNO's major partners (a combination of universities, research institutes and industrial partners). The Foundation was granted access to the DIANA source code thus enabling them to further develop DIANA. It became the role of TNO to transfer these developments into the production version of DIANA.\n\n===1990s to 2003===\nBetween 1990 and 2003, with continuing development and input from the Users Association and the DIANA Foundation, DIANA became recognised worldwide for its analysis capabilities. DIANA Analysis BV was established to manage the sales, marketing, promotion and support of DIANA. In the late 1990s FEMGV (produced by FEMSYS Ltd (UK)) was introduced and promoted by TNO as a pre/post processor which could be coupled to DIANA providing an interactive graphical interface. In the early 2000s, FEMGV was embedded into the DIANA programme and became known as iDIANA and distributed as part of the DIANA package. FEMGV continued to be sold separately by TNO (and now TNO DIANA BV). \nIn October 2002 the Third DIANA World Conference<ref>{{cite book|title=Finite Element in Civil Engineering Applications|date=January 2002|isbn=978-9058095305|edition=1st|editor1=Hendriks, M.A.N. |editor2=Rots, J.A. }}</ref> took place in Tokyo. By this time, Japan had become the most important export market for DIANA. The emphasis of the conference was on application of advanced computational models in civil engineering applications.\n\n===2003 to present ===\nIn 2002 TNO prepared a new organization around DIANA: a company named TNO DIANA BV was founded and in the beginning of 2003 all technical activities were transferred from TNO Building and Construction research to the new company. Also the marketing and sales activities, until then being done by DIANA Analysis BV, were transferred to TNO DIANA BV. At the same time TNO DIANA BV became owner of Femsys Ltd. The purpose for creating this new organization was to combine commercial and technical activities and to have full focus to needs of DIANAusers worldwide.\n\nBetween 2006 and 2011, TNO DIANA BV established a relationship with the Korean software developer MIDAS. In conjunction with MIDAS, the FX+ for DIANA pre/post processor was developed for use specifically with DIANA and was sold as an additional option to purchasers. In return, TNO DIANA BV helped MIDAS embed elements of DIANA into their midasGTS product as its solver. During this period, TNO DIANA BV was also a reseller of MIDAS products: midasCIVIL; midasFEA; midasGEN; and midasGTS. At the end of 2011, following the completion of the FX for DIANA and midasGTS projects, the relationship between TNO DIANA BV and MIDAS was distanced allowing each company to concentrate on the sales and development of their own products.\n\nIn January 2012 came the next iteration of the DIANA software, DIANA 9.4.4. Two new application modules were made available which signified a leap forward in the analysis of reinforced concrete.\n\nThe module \u201cReinforcement Design Checks\u201d gave civil engineers the opportunity to optimise the design of structures by assessing the additional capacity within the existing reinforcement. Running alongside this, the new module \u201cStiffness Adaptation Analysis\u201d made it possible to predict crack patterns, the size of crack openings, plasticity onset, force distribution and deformations in serviceability limit state.\n\nFor geotechnical engineers the ability to carry out a Strength Reduction Analysis (C-Phi) was made available in a new module. This allowed the strength characteristics of the structural material to be reduced by factors leading to the loss of stability, typically used in slope stability analysis. In 2014 there were two releases of DIANA (9.5 & 9.6), these releases introduced the new Mesh Edit graphical user interface. With the ultimate goal of providing TNO DIANA's own integrated graphical user interface. Mesh Edit offers a streamlined and user friendly interface which will ultimately enable users to use all the functionality of DIANA within one program.\n\nThe initial iteration of MeshEdit gave the users the ability to import their model from FX+ or iDIANA and then define supports, loading, materials and analysis requirements; carry out the analysis; and deal with post processing. In 9.6 these features were extended to include a Python scripting console, the introduction of mesh sets and further post processing functionality.\n\nDIANA 10.1, is released in late 2016, with improved integration of modelling, meshing and analysis in one unique, and integrated, environment. This platform has been empowered by use of a parasolid geometry modeller and the latest generation of hexa dominant mesh engine. New post-processing features enable the user to interpret and visualise the results in a very flexible post-processing environment. On 1 July 2016, TNO DIANA BV changed its name to DIANA FEA BV \"to reflect the name of the product and place more emphasis on DIANA rather than its ties to TNO\".\n\n== DIANA functionality

The software is utilised at both ends of the market, by small consultancies and global engineering consultants, research institutions and is utilised by many highly respected educational institutions worldwide in both civil and geotechnical engineering courses. DIANA is equipped with very powerful solvers which enables the analysis of a wide range of structures, large and small - with basic or advanced analyses. A large selection of material models, element libraries and analysis procedures are available within the package which gives DIANA a large degree of flexibility. The main fields of use of DIANA include design and analysis of dams & dikes; tunnels & underground structures; oil & gas<ref>{{cite book|title=DIANA Computational Mechanics '94|year=1994|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=978-94-010-4454-7|pages=339\u2013348|author=Endal.

The initial idea had been to develop an in-house code for consultancy work in the field of concrete mechanics and civil engineering. This code was based on the displacement method, and was called \u201cDIANA\u201d \u2013 an acronym for '''DI'''splacement '''ANA'''lyser. \nBy 1975, DIANA was being used for the analysis of a number of complex off-shore structures in the Netherlands. Experience gained from these projects led to the realisation that in order to model, mesh and analyse large reinforced concrete structures in a streamlined fashion (and within one package), a huge amount of processing power would be required. At that point TNO started to invest in not only developing the DIANA software but also in the purchase of, what was then, up to the minute computing equipment. In the following years, TNO continued to expand the limitations of the DIANA software, introducing MESH for automatic mesh generation and GRAPHI to display the model and analysis results. In 1977, DIANA was used to analyse parts of the [[Oosterscheldekering|Oosterschelde Deltawerken]] in Zeeland, the Netherlands. By this time, the amount of time required to carry out analyses had significantly decreased, and DIANA was becoming increasingly recognised for its capabilities.\n\n===1980s to 1990s===\nThe first release of DIANA, \u201cDIANA-1\u201d, was made available to the Ministry of Public Works in the Hague ([[Rijkswaterstaat]]) in 1980. The result of this and more sales, further funding and development took place and in 1984 the [http://www.dianausers.nl/eng/ DIANA Users Association] was established. This users forum was established to, and continues to, provide an exchange of users experience and indicate development priorities to TNO (now to DIANA FEA BV). Release 2.0 of DIANA was made available in 1988, this included new modules for potential flow analysis and connection to external pre/post processors. For the first time users manuals, course books and text books were made available in English \u2013 this quickly led to the first sales of DIANA outside of the Netherlands. In 1989, the DIANA Foundation was formed, members included TNO's major partners (a combination of universities, research institutes and industrial partners). The Foundation was granted access to the DIANA source code thus enabling them to further develop DIANA. It became the role of TNO to transfer these developments into the production version of DIANA.\n\n===1990s to 2003===\nBetween 1990 and 2003, with continuing development and input from the Users Association and the DIANA Foundation, DIANA became recognised worldwide for its analysis capabilities. DIANA Analysis BV was established to manage the sales, marketing, promotion and support of DIANA. In the late 1990s FEMGV (produced by FEMSYS Ltd (UK)) was introduced and promoted by TNO as a pre/post processor which could be coupled to DIANA providing an interactive graphical interface. In the early 2000s, FEMGV was embedded into the DIANA programme and became known as iDIANA and distributed as part of the DIANA package. FEMGV continued to be sold separately by TNO (and now TNO DIANA BV). \nIn October 2002 the Third DIANA World Conference<ref>{{cite book|title=Finite Element in Civil Engineering Applications|date=January 2002|isbn=978-9058095305|edition=1st|editor1=Hendriks, M.A.N. |editor2=Rots, J.A. }}</ref> took place in Tokyo. By this time, Japan had become the most important export market for DIANA. The emphasis of the conference was on application of advanced computational models in civil engineering applications.\n\n===2003 to present ===\nIn 2002 TNO prepared a new organization around DIANA: a company named TNO DIANA BV was founded and in the beginning of 2003 all technical activities were transferred from TNO Building and Construction research to the new company. Also the marketing and sales activities, until then being done by DIANA Analysis BV, were transferred to TNO DIANA BV. At the same time TNO DIANA BV became owner of Femsys Ltd. The purpose for creating this new organization was to combine commercial and technical activities and to have full focus to needs of DIANAusers worldwide.\n\nBetween 2006 and 2011, TNO DIANA BV established a relationship with the Korean software developer MIDAS. In conjunction with MIDAS, the FX+ for DIANA pre/post processor was developed for use specifically with DIANA and was sold as an additional option to purchasers. In return, TNO DIANA BV helped MIDAS embed elements of DIANA into their midasGTS product as its solver. During this period, TNO DIANA BV was also a reseller of MIDAS products: midasCIVIL; midasFEA; midasGEN; and midasGTS. At the end of 2011, following the completion of the FX for DIANA and midasGTS projects, the relationship between TNO DIANA BV and MIDAS was distanced allowing each company to concentrate on the sales and development of their own products.\n\nIn January 2012 came the next iteration of the DIANA software, DIANA 9.4.4. Two new application modules were made available which signified a leap forward in the analysis of reinforced concrete.\n\nThe module \u201cReinforcement Design Checks\u201d gave civil engineers the opportunity to optimise the design of structures by assessing the additional capacity within the existing reinforcement. Running alongside this, the new module \u201cStiffness Adaptation Analysis\u201d made it possible to predict crack patterns, the size of crack openings, plasticity onset, force distribution and deformations in serviceability limit state.\n\nFor geotechnical engineers the ability to carry out a Strength Reduction Analysis (C-Phi) was made available in a new module. This allowed the strength characteristics of the structural material to be reduced by factors leading to the loss of stability, typically used in slope stability analysis. In 2014 there were two releases of DIANA (9.5 & 9.6), these releases introduced the new Mesh Edit graphical user interface. With the ultimate goal of providing TNO DIANA's own integrated graphical user interface. Mesh Edit offers a streamlined and user friendly interface which will ultimately enable users to use all the functionality of DIANA within one program.\n\nThe initial iteration of MeshEdit gave the users the ability to import their model from FX+ or iDIANA and then define supports, loading, materials and analysis requirements; carry out the analysis; and deal with post processing. In 9.6 these features were extended to include a Python scripting console, the introduction of mesh sets and further post processing functionality.\n\nDIANA 10.1, is released in late 2016, with improved integration of modelling, meshing and analysis in one unique, and integrated, environment. This platform has been empowered by use of a parasolid geometry modeller and the latest generation of hexa dominant mesh engine. New post-processing features enable the user to interpret and visualise the results in a very flexible post-processing environment. On 1 July 2016, TNO DIANA BV changed its name to DIANA FEA BV \"to reflect the name of the product and place more emphasis on DIANA rather than its ties to TNO\".\n\n== DIANA functionality

The first ''(The Big Game) Mega Millions'' drawing was in 2002; see below.

The jackpot increases when there is no top-prize winner.<ref name=wp2018 />\n\nReflecting common practice among American [[lottery|lotteries]], the jackpot is advertised as a [[nominal value]] of annual installments.

The expansion occurred on January 31, 2010, as 23 Powerball members began selling Mega Millions tickets for their first drawing on February 2, 2010; likewise, 10 Mega Millions members began selling Powerball tickets for their first drawing the next day. [[Montana]] (joining Mega Millions on March 1, 2010) was the first jurisdiction to add either game after the cross-sell expansion. [[Nebraska]] (March 20, 2010), [[Oregon]] (March 28, 2010), [[Arizona]] (April 18, 2010), [[Maine]] (May 9, 2010), [[Colorado]] and [[South Dakota]] (the latter two on May 16, 2010) also have joined Mega Millions since the expansion.\n\nAs of January 2020, there were 47 lotteries offering Mega Millions ''and'' Powerball; Florida joined Mega Millions in May 2013. (Puerto Rico, whose lottery began in the 1930s, currently does not offer Mega Millions.) Mississippi began selling lottery tickets in 2019; it joined Mega Millions on January 30, 2020.\n\nBefore the agreement, the only stores which sold Mega Millions ''and'' Powerball tickets were retailers whose business was on a border between jurisdictions which sold competing games.\n\nThe current Mega Millions format began in October 2017. Plays are $2 per game. For an additional $1 per play, the ''Megaplier'', if activated, multiplies non-jackpot prizes. Multipliers are 2x, 3x, 4x, and 5x (a second-prize Megaplier play can win $5 million cash.) The Megaplier is not available in California, or on ''Just the Jackpot'' wagers (where offered.)<ref>http://www.megamillions.com/how-to-play</ref>\n\n=== Current Mega Millions members ===\n[[File:stateswithlotto.png|thumb|400px|As of January 30, 2020, Mega Millions is available in 45 states and the [[District of Columbia]] (''in blue''), plus the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] ''(not shown)''.]]\n\nMega Millions replaced ''The Big Game'' in 2002 (see below for the evolution of the name ''Mega Millions'').\n\n=== Mega Millions and Powerball ===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Lottery \n!Powerball\n!Mega Millions\n|-\n|[[Arizona Lottery|Arizona]]\n|{{dts|April 4, 1994}}\n|{{dts|April 18, 2010}}\n|-\n|[[Arkansas Scholarship Lottery|Arkansas]]\n|{{dts|October 31, 2009}}\n|{{dts|January 31, 2010}}\n|-\n|[[California State Lottery|California]]\n|{{dts|April 8, 2013}}\n|{{dts|June 22, 2005}}\n|-\n|[[Connecticut Lottery|Connecticut]]\n|{{dts|November 28, 1995}}\n|{{dts|January 31, 2010}}\n|-\n|[[Colorado Lottery|Colorado]]\n|{{dts|August 2, 2001}}\n|{{dts|May 16, 2010}}\n|-\n|[[Delaware Lottery|Delaware]]\n|{{dts|January 14, 1991}}\n|{{dts|January 31, 2010}}\n|-\n|[[D.C.

''The Big Game'' was created and designed by Michigan Lottery Commissioner Bill Martin and Illinois Lottery Director Desiree Rogers after having discussions regarding a multi-state game with lottery directors [[Rebecca Paul]] of the Georgia Lottery and [[Penelope W. Kyle]] of the Virginia Lottery. ''The Big Game'' initially was drawn weekly, on Friday.\n\nThe Georgia Lottery was a member of MUSL at the time and wanted to sell both games for the remainder of 1996; however, within a few days, Georgia was forcibly removed from MUSL, returning with the 2010 cross-selling expansion.\n\nBeginning in January 1999, jackpot winners were given the option to receive their prize in [[present value|cash]]. In May 1999, [[New Jersey]] joined ''The Big Game'', the only jurisdiction to enter as a participant before ''The Big Game'' became Mega Millions in 2002.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== ''The Big Game Mega Millions'' ===\n[[File:The Big Game Mega Millions Logo.png|thumb|201px|right|''The Big Game Mega Millions'' logo following the addition of the name ''Mega Millions'']] Ohio and New York joined ''The Big Game'' consortium on May 15, 2002, when the game was renamed ''The Big Game Mega Millions'', temporarily retaining the old name and the original \"gold ball\" logo. The \"Big Money Ball\" became the \"Mega Ball.\" While the game's name was altered, the yellow ball in the new Mega Millions logo continued to read \"The Big Game\" until February 2003, after which it was replaced with six stars representing the original members of the consortium. The first ''(The Big Game) Mega Millions'' drawing was held two days later, on May 17. The Mega Millions trademark is owned by the Illinois Lottery. The first three lotteries to join Mega Millions were [[Washington (state)|Washington]] (in September 2002), [[Texas]] (in 2003), and [[California]] (in 2005); California was the last addition to Mega Millions before the cross-sell expansion of 2010. Montana joined Mega Millions on March 1, 2010, the first addition to Mega Millions after the cross-sell expansion.\n\nWhen Texas joined Mega Millions in 2003, it began offering an option, initially available only to Texas Lottery players, known as the ''Megaplier'', which was similar to Powerball's ''Power Play''. The 11 Mega Millions lotteries without ''Megaplier'' on the January 31, 2010 cross-selling date gradually added the multiplier option; by January 2011, all Mega Millions lotteries, except for California, offered the ''Megaplier''. The Texas Lottery owns the trademark to ''Megaplier''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mainelottery.com/games/megamillions.shtml |title=Mega Millions with Megaplier: Maine State Lottery |publisher=Mainelottery.com |date=2013-09-24 |accessdate=2013-12-18}}</ref>\n\nOn June 24, 2005, to commemorate California joining Mega Millions, that night's drawing was held in [[Hollywood]], with [[Carrie Underwood]] assisting host Glenn Burns for the draw.\n\nFor the November 15, 2005 drawing, a group called \"The Lucky 7\" held the only jackpot-winning ticket, purchased in [[Anaheim, California]], winning $315 million. They chose the cash option, splitting $175 million before federal withholdings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.megamillions.com/winners/winner.asp?bioID=94FAEA2C-A966-44C3-8D6C-620756BEDFBA&startItem=1 |title=California's First Mega Millions Jackpot Winners The Lucky Seven -- Claim Prize |publisher=Mega Millions |date=2005-11-18 |accessdate=2013-12-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121134302/http://www.megamillions.com/winners/winner.asp?bioID=94FAEA2C-A966-44C3-8D6C-620756BEDFBA&startItem=1|archivedate=2013-01-21}}</ref>\n\nOn March 6, 2007, the Mega Millions jackpot reached $390 million,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.megamillions.com/winners/jackpothistory.asp |title=Mega Millions Jackpot History |publisher=Megamillions.com |date= 2013-09-29|accessdate=2013-12-18| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130929051737/http://www.megamillions.com/winners/jackpothistory.asp| archivedate = 2013-09-29}}</ref> which was then the record for the third largest jackpot in U.S. history.

In October 2009, an agreement between Mega Millions and MUSL allowed all U.S. lotteries, including New Jersey's, to offer both games. On January 31, 2010, Mega Millions expanded to include the 23 MUSL members; as of that date, 35 jurisdictions were participating in Mega Millions. On the same day, 10 existing Mega Millions-participating lotteries began selling Powerball tickets. Ohio joined Powerball on April 16, 2010. On March 1, 2010, Montana became the first MUSL member to add Mega Millions ''after'' the cross-sell expansion. Nebraska became the 37th Mega Millions participating member on March 20, 2010, followed by Oregon as the 38th member on March 28, Arizona as the 39th member on April 18, and Maine as 40th Mega Millions participant on May 9, 2010. Colorado and South Dakota added Mega Millions on May 16, 2010, bringing the total to 42 jurisdictions.\n\nRecent additions to Mega Millions included the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], in October 2010, and Louisiana in November 2011. Florida joined Mega Millions on May 15, 2013; the first drawing to include Florida-bought tickets was two days later.\n\nPresumably due to their experience with the ''Power Play'' option for Powerball, all 23 lotteries joining Mega Millions on January 31, 2010 immediately offered ''Megaplier'' to their players. The ''Megaplier'' continues to be drawn by Texas Lottery computers, as California does not offer the multiplier. Montana, offering Powerball before the expansion date, became the 24th lottery to offer the Megaplier, followed by Nebraska (the 25th), Oregon (the 26th), Arizona (as the 27th) and Maine (as the 28th lottery to offer the ''Megaplier'' option). After Colorado and South Dakota joined Mega Millions, this raised the number of lotteries offering the ''Megaplier'' to 37.\n\nMega Millions tickets bought with the Megaplier option, beginning September 12, 2010, automatically won $1 million (instead of $250,000) if the five white balls \u2013 but excluding the Mega Ball \u2013 are matched.\n\nOn March 13, 2010, New Jersey became the first Mega Millions participant (just before the cross-sell expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning ticket for Powerball after joining that game. The ticket was worth over $211 million annuity (the cash option was chosen). On May 28, 2010, North Carolina became the first Powerball member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Mega Millions ticket after joining Mega Millions, with an annuity jackpot of $12 million.\n\nIn January 2012, Mega Millions' rival Powerball was altered; among the changes were a price increase of $1 for each play, as a result, a base game costs $2, or $3 with the ''Power Play'' option. At the time, there were no plans to change the price of a Mega Millions play, with or without the ''Megaplier'' (see below for the 2017 format change that includes the base price for a Mega Millions play to be raised to $2). The price increase for playing Powerball was a major factor in [[Louisiana]] deciding to pursue joining Mega Millions, as that state's lottery joined Mega Millions on November 16, 2011.\n\n=== October 2013 format change ===\nThe final 5/56 + 1/46 Mega Millions drawing was held on October 18, 2013; that night's jackpot of $37 million was not won. The first drawing under the revised 5/75 + 1/15 format\u2014which saw the jackpot estimate \"leap\" to $55 million due to the change in the annuity structure\u2014occurred on October 22, 2013. The minimum jackpot was then $15 million, with rollovers of at least $5 million. Second prize (5+0) became $1 million cash. In the revised format, players chose 5 of 75 white ball numbers, and the \"Gold Ball\" number out of 15.\n\nThe ''Megaplier'' option remained; the 5x multiplier was added.\n\nLower prize tiers (through October 18, 2013) based on a $1 play:\n*Match 5+0: $250,000\n*Match 4+MB: $10,000\n*Match 4+0: $150\n*Match 3+MB: $150\n*Match 3+0: $7\n*Match 2+MB: $10\n*Match 1+MB: $3\n*Match 0+MB: $2\n\nPayouts in California remained [[Parimutuel betting|pari-mutuel]].\n\nThe odds of winning or sharing a Mega Millions jackpot (October 19, 2013 \u2013 October 27, 2017): 1 in about 258.9 million. The overall odds of winning a prize were 1 in 14.71, including the base $1 prize for a \"Mega Ball\"-only match.\n\nPrizes and odds (2013-2017 version) based on a $1 play:\n*5 numbers plus the Mega Ball (5+1): Jackpot; 1 in 258,890,850\n*5 numbers but not the Mega Ball (5+0): $1,000,000; $ 1 in 17,259,390\n*4+1: $5,000; 1 in 739,688 \n*4+0: $500; 1 in 52,835\n*3+1: $50; 1 in 10,720\n*3+0: $5; 1 in 766\n*2+1: $5; 1 in 473\n*1+1: $2; 1 in 56\n*Mega Ball ''only'': $1; 1 in 21\n\nThe odds for winning the $1 prize, 1 in 21, reflected the possibility of matching ''none'' of the white balls, but matching the Mega Ball.\n\nThe annuity\u2014which was 20 annual payments (no cash option was available) when ''The Big Game'' began\u2014changed from 26 equal yearly installments to 30 graduated annual payments (increasing 5 percent yearly) with the format change on October 19, 2013.\n\n=== October 2017 format/price point change ===\nOn October 28, 2017, the price of a Mega Millions play doubled, to $2; the first drawing under the current price point was October 31, 2017. The Mega Millions double matrix changed, from 5/75 + 1/15 to the current 5/70 + 1/25.<ref>[blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/274243/mega-millions-lottery-tickets-will-go-from-1-to-2/ Mega Millions lottery tickets will go from $1 to $2]</ref> The starting jackpot became $40 million, with minimum rollovers of $5 million. The \"Megaplier\" option (which again is not offered in California) was retained, with an adjustment to its multipliers. (The final jackpot for the $1 version was $30 million, which was not won; the initial jackpot for the new version would still be $40 million with a jackpot hit.)\n\n=== April 2020 format change ===\nHowever in the new version regulations (which began on Saturday April 4, 2020 with the first drawing on Tuesday April 7) for Mega Millions, the minimum Mega Millions advertised [[Progressive jackpot|jackpot]] is $20&nbsp;million, paid in 30 graduated yearly installments, increasing based upon sales the sales of everywhere;percent each year (unless the cash option is chosen; see below for differences by lotteries on cash/annuity choice regulations.) The jackpot increases when there is no top-prize winner.<ref name=wp2020 />\n\nMega Millions' non-California prize tiers effective April 5, 2020 (old prizes in parentheses; changed amounts in '''boldface''') for a $2 base play:\n\n* 5+MB: Jackpot; '''starting jackpot to $20 million (annuity value)'''\n* 5+0: $1,000,000 ($1,000,000)\n* 4+MB: '''$10,000''' ($5,000)\n* 4+0: $500 ($500)\n* 3+MB: '''$200''' ($50)\n* 3+0: '''$10''' ($5)\n* 2+MB: '''$10''' ($5)\n* 1+MB: '''$4''' ($2)\n* 0+MB: '''$2''' ($1)\n\nThe new prize structure allocates roughly 75 percent of the prize pool for the jackpot; this is, in part, to facilitate the new ''Just the Jackpot'' option. The 2013-2017 version allocated about 68 percent towards the jackpot.\n\n=== \"Just the Jackpot\" option ===\n\nIn preparation for the October 28, 2017 format change the then-46 Mega Millions members were given the '''choice''' of offering a $3, two-game play (called \"Just the Jackpot\"). A player choosing this option is not eligible for any of the eight lower-tier prizes; therefore, the Megaplier option is not available for ''Just the Jackpot'' wagers.\n\nThese lotteries offered the \"Just the Jackpot\" option upon the format change: [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Indiana]], [[Kansas]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Nebraska]], [[New Jersey]], [[New Mexico]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Ohio]], [[South Dakota]], [[Texas]], [[Virginia]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Wyoming]]. [[Kentucky]] has since added \"Just the Jackpot\", with other lotteries potentially adding it. Not known is whether a second series of playslips would be printed for lotteries offering \"Just the Jackpot\" beginning after the October 28, 2017 format change.\n\n\"Just the Jackpot\" wagers and regular Mega Millions plays are printed on separate tickets. Most ''Just the Jackpot'' wagers are terminal-generated; however, ''JtJ'' wagers in Kansas and Texas allow the player to choose their numbers, while Wisconsin players must ask for a terminal-generated ticket.\n\nAs of January 2020, there has yet to be a jackpot winner from a ''Just the Jackpot'' wager; there also is no known count of ''JtJ'' wagers that would have won second prize (5+0) with a traditional Mega Millions play.\n\n=== Record jackpots ===\nThe largest Mega Millions jackpot, $1.537 billion, was won on October 23, 2018 by one ticket, sold in South Carolina. This prize, the largest for one set of numbers in world history, was the second largest lottery payout, behind Powerball's $1.586 billion jackpot won on January 13, 2016 by multiple tickets. The record Mega Millions jackpot was claimed on March 5, 2019, with the winner choosing to remain anonymous under South Carolina law.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2019/03/04/mystery-winner-finally-claims-billion-mega-millions-jackpot-ending-months-speculation/]</ref>\n\nThe second-largest Mega Millions jackpot advertised as $640 million at the time of the drawing (annuitized) or $462 million (cash value), was drawn on March 30, 2012. The initial estimate for that drawing (following the March 27 drawing, which was $363 million annuity) was $476 million (later increased to $500 million and again to $540 million); brisk ticket sales pushed the jackpot values, both annuitized (to $656 million) and the cash option ($474 million) higher. The amount spent on Mega Millions for drawings following its previous jackpot win, on January 24, 2012, was at least $1.5 [[1,000,000,000|billion]].<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=March 31, 2012 |title=Mega Millions mania leads to disappointment in California |author1=Matt Stevens |author2=Carol J.

Therefore, (75 x 74 x 73 x 72 x 71)/ (5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1) x 15 = 258,890,850, which means any combination of five white balls plus the Megaball has a 1:258,890,850 chance of winning the jackpot. Similarly, the odds for second prize were 1:(<sub>75</sub>C<sub>5</sub>) x (15/14) = 1: 18,492,204 chance of winning. The overall probability of winning any prize was 1 in 14.7. If there are no jackpot winners for a specific drawing, the jackpot will keep increasing; however, the odds will still remain the same.\n\nPayouts through October 18, 2013:\n{| cellspacing=3; class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|Matches<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n!rowspan=2|Prize\n!rowspan=2|Approximate probability of winning\n|-\n|White balls (pool of 56)\n|Mega Ball (pool of 46)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 5\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Jackpot<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n|1 in 175,711,536 (<sub>56</sub>C<sub>5</sub>\u00d746)<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%2856+choose+5%29*46\n| title = (56 choose 5)*46\n| accessdate = 2013-12-18 | date = 2013-12-18| publisher = [[Google]]\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/v/mega-millions-jackpot-probability |publisher=Khan Academy |title=Mega Millions Jackpot Probability |author=Sal Khan}}</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|5\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $250,000\n|1 in 3,904,701 (<sub>56</sub>C<sub>5</sub>\u00d746/45)<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%205%29*%2851%20choose%200%29*45%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 5)*(51 choose 0)*45) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $10,000\n|1 in 689,065<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%204%29*%2851%20choose%201%29%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 4)*(51 choose 1)) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $150\n|1 in 15,313<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%204%29*%2851%20choose%201%29*45%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 4)*(51 choose 1)*45) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $150\n|1 in 13,781<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%203%29*%2851%20choose%202%29%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 3)*(51 choose 2)) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $10\n|1 in 844<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%202%29*%2851%20choose%203%29%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 2)*(51 choose 3)) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $7\n|1 in 306<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%203%29*%2851%20choose%202%29*45%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 3)*(51 choose 2)*45) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $3\n|1 in 141<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%201%29*%2851%20choose%204%29%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 1)*(51 choose 4)) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $2\n|1 in 74.8 (the probability for this prize was not 1:46, because there is the possibility of matching at least one of the \"white\" balls, which decreases the likelihood of matching ''only'' the \"Mega Ball\")<ref name=MMHow />\n|}\n\nOverall probabilities: 1 in 755 of winning any of the top six prizes,<ref name=MMHow /> 1 in 40 of winning any prize.<ref name=\"Lotto numbers\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.lottonumbers.net/usa/megamillions/ |title=Lotto Numbers |access-date=2011-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212014739/http://www.lottonumbers.net/usa/megamillions/ |archive-date=2011-12-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn California, prize levels are paid on a [[parimutuel]] basis, rather than the fixed lower-tier amounts for winners in other Mega Millions jurisdictions.

Individually, the five white balls, several seconds apart, drop through a hole in the bottom of the mixing drum.\n\n=== Record jackpots (listed by ''cash value'') ===\n{{see also|Lottery jackpot records}}\n\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n|Cash value (in millions USD)\n|Annuity value (in millions USD)\n!Drawing date\n!Winner(s)\n!Description\n|-\n|$878\n|$1,537\n|October 23, 2018<ref name=cbcnews2018 />\n|1 [[South Carolina Education Lottery|SC]]\n|World's largest jackpot (cash or annuity)\n|-\n|$474\n|$656\n|March 30, 2012\n|3 ([[Maryland Lottery|MD]], [[Kansas Lottery|KS]], [[Illinois|IL]])\n|World's third largest jackpot (cash or annuity)\n|-\n|$347.7<ref name=MM648MClaimAtlanta/>\n|$648<ref name=MM648M />\n|December 17, 2013\n|2 ([[California Lottery|CA]], [[Georgia Lottery|GA]])\n|Second-largest annuity value\n|-\n|$320\n|$543\n|July 24, 2018<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/03/group-of-co-workers-are-winners-of-543-million-mega-millions-jackpot.html|title=A group of 11 co-workers are the winners of a $543 million Mega Millions jackpot.

Around the same time, for entirely different reasons, Ohio's governor also gave the green light to joining a multi-jurisdictional game. Both lotteries opted to join ''The Big Game'', which, at the time, was offered in seven states. The added populations of the two new jurisdictions, in turn, led to a larger double matrix. The first machine continued to hold white 52 balls, while 16 gold balls were added in the second, meaning there were 52 numbers to pick from in both parts of each $1 game. On May 15, 2002, the game was renamed ''The Big Game Mega Millions''; shortly after, it became just ''Mega Millions''. Except for the 2010 cross-selling expansion, this was the only time ''The Big Game'' or Mega Millions simultaneously added more than one member.\n\nIn 2005, Mega Millions was the target of a mailing scam. A letter bearing the Mega Millions logo was used in a string of lottery scams designed to trick people into providing personal financial information by cashing bogus checks. The letter, which had been sent to people in several states via standard mail, included a check for what the scammers said was an unclaimed Mega Millions prize. If the check was cashed, it bounced, but not before the bank stamped it with a routing number and personal account information and sent it back to the fraudulent organization, providing them with the recipients' financial information.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scamfraudalert.com/f23/mega-millions-logo-officials-warn-lottery-scams-5259/ |title=Mega Millions Logo Officials Warn of Lottery scams |publisher=ScamFraudAlert |date=2011-11-28 |accessdate=2011-12-21}}</ref>\n\nA budget impasse due to the [[2006 New Jersey Government shutdown]] led to the temporary closing of its non-essential agencies on July 1, 2006. Among the casualties were the [[Atlantic City]] casinos and the [[New Jersey Lottery]]. Not only were New Jersey's in-house games (such as [[New Jersey Pick 6|Pick-6]]) not drawn for about a week, but all New Jersey lottery terminals were shut down, meaning Mega Millions could not be played in New Jersey, even though Mega Millions was drawn as usual. A similar shutdown happened in [[Minnesota]] on July 1, 2011.\n\nElecia Battle made national headlines in January 2004 when she claimed that she had lost the winning ticket in the December 30, 2003 Mega Millions drawing.<ref name=\"bbcnews\">{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3373077.stm| title = Women argue over 'lost' jackpot | publisher = BBC News | date = 2004-01-06 | accessdate = 2008-02-19}}</ref> She then filed a lawsuit against the woman who had come forward with the ticket, Rebecca Jemison.

One such usage involved character [[Hugo \"Hurley\" Reyes]] playing the sequence in a similar \"Mega Lotto\" game, winning a nine-figure jackpot and subsequently experiencing numerous misfortunes in his personal life. The first three numbers (4, 8, 15) and mega ball (42) in the Mega Millions drawing matched the first three numbers and the final number (which Hurley also used as the \"mega ball\" number) in the ''Lost'' sequence. The last two numbers in the Mega Millions drawing did not match the last two numbers that were used in the scene.

The expansion occurred on January 31, 2010, as 23 Powerball members began selling Mega Millions tickets for their first drawing on February 2, 2010; likewise, 10 Mega Millions members began selling Powerball tickets for their first drawing the next day. [[Montana]] (joining Mega Millions on March 1, 2010) was the first jurisdiction to add either game after the cross-sell expansion. [[Nebraska]] (March 20, 2010), [[Oregon]] (March 28, 2010), [[Arizona]] (April 18, 2010), [[Maine]] (May 9, 2010), [[Colorado]] and [[South Dakota]] (the latter two on May 16, 2010) also have joined Mega Millions since the expansion.\n\nAs of January 2020, there were 47 lotteries offering Mega Millions ''and'' Powerball; Florida joined Mega Millions in May 2013. (Puerto Rico, whose lottery began in the 1930s, currently does not offer Mega Millions.) Mississippi began selling lottery tickets in 2019; it joined Mega Millions on January 30, 2020.\n\nBefore the agreement, the only stores which sold Mega Millions ''and'' Powerball tickets were retailers whose business was on a border between jurisdictions which sold competing games.\n\nThe current Mega Millions format began in October 2017. Plays are $2 per game. For an additional $1 per play, the ''Megaplier'', if activated, multiplies non-jackpot prizes.

''The Big Game'' was created and designed by Michigan Lottery Commissioner Bill Martin and Illinois Lottery Director Desiree Rogers after having discussions regarding a multi-state game with lottery directors [[Rebecca Paul]] of the Georgia Lottery and [[Penelope W. Kyle]] of the Virginia Lottery. ''The Big Game'' initially was drawn weekly, on Friday.\n\nThe Georgia Lottery was a member of MUSL at the time and wanted to sell both games for the remainder of 1996; however, within a few days, Georgia was forcibly removed from MUSL, returning with the 2010 cross-selling expansion.\n\nBeginning in January 1999, jackpot winners were given the option to receive their prize in [[present value|cash]]. In May 1999, [[New Jersey]] joined ''The Big Game'', the only jurisdiction to enter as a participant before ''The Big Game'' became Mega Millions in 2002.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== ''The Big Game Mega Millions'' ===\n[[File:The Big Game Mega Millions Logo.png|thumb|201px|right|''The Big Game Mega Millions'' logo following the addition of the name ''Mega Millions'']] Ohio and New York joined ''The Big Game'' consortium on May 15, 2002, when the game was renamed ''The Big Game Mega Millions'', temporarily retaining the old name and the original \"gold ball\" logo. The \"Big Money Ball\" became the \"Mega Ball.\" While the game's name was altered, the yellow ball in the new Mega Millions logo continued to read \"The Big Game\" until February 2003, after which it was replaced with six stars representing the original members of the consortium. The first ''(The Big Game) Mega Millions'' drawing was held two days later, on May 17. The Mega Millions trademark is owned by the Illinois Lottery. The first three lotteries to join Mega Millions were [[Washington (state)|Washington]] (in September 2002), [[Texas]] (in 2003), and [[California]] (in 2005); California was the last addition to Mega Millions before the cross-sell expansion of 2010. Montana joined Mega Millions on March 1, 2010, the first addition to Mega Millions after the cross-sell expansion.\n\nWhen Texas joined Mega Millions in 2003, it began offering an option, initially available only to Texas Lottery players, known as the ''Megaplier'', which was similar to Powerball's ''Power Play''. The 11 Mega Millions lotteries without ''Megaplier'' on the January 31, 2010 cross-selling date gradually added the multiplier option; by January 2011, all Mega Millions lotteries, except for California, offered the ''Megaplier''. The Texas Lottery owns the trademark to ''Megaplier''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mainelottery.com/games/megamillions.shtml |title=Mega Millions with Megaplier: Maine State Lottery |publisher=Mainelottery.com |date=2013-09-24 |accessdate=2013-12-18}}</ref>\n\nOn June 24, 2005, to commemorate California joining Mega Millions, that night's drawing was held in [[Hollywood]], with [[Carrie Underwood]] assisting host Glenn Burns for the draw.\n\nFor the November 15, 2005 drawing, a group called \"The Lucky 7\" held the only jackpot-winning ticket, purchased in [[Anaheim, California]], winning $315 million. They chose the cash option, splitting $175 million before federal withholdings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.megamillions.com/winners/winner.asp?bioID=94FAEA2C-A966-44C3-8D6C-620756BEDFBA&startItem=1 |title=California's First Mega Millions Jackpot Winners The Lucky Seven -- Claim Prize |publisher=Mega Millions |date=2005-11-18 |accessdate=2013-12-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121134302/http://www.megamillions.com/winners/winner.asp?bioID=94FAEA2C-A966-44C3-8D6C-620756BEDFBA&startItem=1|archivedate=2013-01-21}}</ref>\n\nOn March 6, 2007, the Mega Millions jackpot reached $390 million,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.megamillions.com/winners/jackpothistory.asp |title=Mega Millions Jackpot History |publisher=Megamillions.com |date= 2013-09-29|accessdate=2013-12-18| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130929051737/http://www.megamillions.com/winners/jackpothistory.asp| archivedate = 2013-09-29}}</ref> which was then the record for the third largest jackpot in U.S. history.

In October 2009, an agreement between Mega Millions and MUSL allowed all U.S. lotteries, including New Jersey's, to offer both games. On January 31, 2010, Mega Millions expanded to include the 23 MUSL members; as of that date, 35 jurisdictions were participating in Mega Millions. On the same day, 10 existing Mega Millions-participating lotteries began selling Powerball tickets. Ohio joined Powerball on April 16, 2010. On March 1, 2010, Montana became the first MUSL member to add Mega Millions ''after'' the cross-sell expansion. Nebraska became the 37th Mega Millions participating member on March 20, 2010, followed by Oregon as the 38th member on March 28, Arizona as the 39th member on April 18, and Maine as 40th Mega Millions participant on May 9, 2010. Colorado and South Dakota added Mega Millions on May 16, 2010, bringing the total to 42 jurisdictions.\n\nRecent additions to Mega Millions included the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], in October 2010, and Louisiana in November 2011. Florida joined Mega Millions on May 15, 2013; the first drawing to include Florida-bought tickets was two days later.\n\nPresumably due to their experience with the ''Power Play'' option for Powerball, all 23 lotteries joining Mega Millions on January 31, 2010 immediately offered ''Megaplier'' to their players. The ''Megaplier'' continues to be drawn by Texas Lottery computers, as California does not offer the multiplier. Montana, offering Powerball before the expansion date, became the 24th lottery to offer the Megaplier, followed by Nebraska (the 25th), Oregon (the 26th), Arizona (as the 27th) and Maine (as the 28th lottery to offer the ''Megaplier'' option). After Colorado and South Dakota joined Mega Millions, this raised the number of lotteries offering the ''Megaplier'' to 37.\n\nMega Millions tickets bought with the Megaplier option, beginning September 12, 2010, automatically won $1 million (instead of $250,000) if the five white balls \u2013 but excluding the Mega Ball \u2013 are matched.\n\nOn March 13, 2010, New Jersey became the first Mega Millions participant (just before the cross-sell expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning ticket for Powerball after joining that game. The ticket was worth over $211 million annuity (the cash option was chosen). On May 28, 2010, North Carolina became the first Powerball member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Mega Millions ticket after joining Mega Millions, with an annuity jackpot of $12 million.\n\nIn January 2012, Mega Millions' rival Powerball was altered; among the changes were a price increase of $1 for each play, as a result, a base game costs $2, or $3 with the ''Power Play'' option. At the time, there were no plans to change the price of a Mega Millions play, with or without the ''Megaplier'' (see below for the 2017 format change that includes the base price for a Mega Millions play to be raised to $2). The price increase for playing Powerball was a major factor in [[Louisiana]] deciding to pursue joining Mega Millions, as that state's lottery joined Mega Millions on November 16, 2011.\n\n=== October 2013 format change ===\nThe final 5/56 + 1/46 Mega Millions drawing was held on October 18, 2013; that night's jackpot of $37 million was not won. The first drawing under the revised 5/75 + 1/15 format\u2014which saw the jackpot estimate \"leap\" to $55 million due to the change in the annuity structure\u2014occurred on October 22, 2013. The minimum jackpot was then $15 million, with rollovers of at least $5 million. Second prize (5+0) became $1 million cash. In the revised format, players chose 5 of 75 white ball numbers, and the \"Gold Ball\" number out of 15.\n\nThe ''Megaplier'' option remained; the 5x multiplier was added.\n\nLower prize tiers (through October 18, 2013) based on a $1 play:\n*Match 5+0: $250,000\n*Match 4+MB: $10,000\n*Match 4+0: $150\n*Match 3+MB: $150\n*Match 3+0: $7\n*Match 2+MB: $10\n*Match 1+MB: $3\n*Match 0+MB: $2\n\nPayouts in California remained [[Parimutuel betting|pari-mutuel]].\n\nThe odds of winning or sharing a Mega Millions jackpot (October 19, 2013 \u2013 October 27, 2017): 1 in about 258.9 million. The overall odds of winning a prize were 1 in 14.71, including the base $1 prize for a \"Mega Ball\"-only match.\n\nPrizes and odds (2013-2017 version) based on a $1 play:\n*5 numbers plus the Mega Ball (5+1): Jackpot; 1 in 258,890,850\n*5 numbers but not the Mega Ball (5+0): $1,000,000; $ 1 in 17,259,390\n*4+1: $5,000; 1 in 739,688 \n*4+0: $500; 1 in 52,835\n*3+1: $50; 1 in 10,720\n*3+0: $5; 1 in 766\n*2+1: $5; 1 in 473\n*1+1: $2; 1 in 56\n*Mega Ball ''only'': $1; 1 in 21\n\nThe odds for winning the $1 prize, 1 in 21, reflected the possibility of matching ''none'' of the white balls, but matching the Mega Ball.\n\nThe annuity\u2014which was 20 annual payments (no cash option was available) when ''The Big Game'' began\u2014changed from 26 equal yearly installments to 30 graduated annual payments (increasing 5 percent yearly) with the format change on October 19, 2013.\n\n=== October 2017 format/price point change ===\nOn October 28, 2017, the price of a Mega Millions play doubled, to $2; the first drawing under the current price point was October 31, 2017. The Mega Millions double matrix changed, from 5/75 + 1/15 to the current 5/70 + 1/25.<ref>[blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/274243/mega-millions-lottery-tickets-will-go-from-1-to-2/ Mega Millions lottery tickets will go from $1 to $2]</ref> The starting jackpot became $40 million, with minimum rollovers of $5 million. The \"Megaplier\" option (which again is not offered in California) was retained, with an adjustment to its multipliers. (The final jackpot for the $1 version was $30 million, which was not won; the initial jackpot for the new version would still be $40 million with a jackpot hit.)\n\n=== April 2020 format change ===\nHowever in the new version regulations (which began on Saturday April 4, 2020 with the first drawing on Tuesday April 7) for Mega Millions, the minimum Mega Millions advertised [[Progressive jackpot|jackpot]] is $20&nbsp;million, paid in 30 graduated yearly installments, increasing based upon sales the sales of everywhere;percent each year (unless the cash option is chosen; see below for differences by lotteries on cash/annuity choice regulations.) The jackpot increases when there is no top-prize winner.<ref name=wp2020 />\n\nMega Millions' non-California prize tiers effective April 5, 2020 (old prizes in parentheses; changed amounts in '''boldface''') for a $2 base play:\n\n* 5+MB: Jackpot; '''starting jackpot to $20 million (annuity value)'''\n* 5+0: $1,000,000 ($1,000,000)\n* 4+MB: '''$10,000''' ($5,000)\n* 4+0: $500 ($500)\n* 3+MB: '''$200''' ($50)\n* 3+0: '''$10''' ($5)\n* 2+MB: '''$10''' ($5)\n* 1+MB: '''$4''' ($2)\n* 0+MB: '''$2''' ($1)\n\nThe new prize structure allocates roughly 75 percent of the prize pool for the jackpot; this is, in part, to facilitate the new ''Just the Jackpot'' option. The 2013-2017 version allocated about 68 percent towards the jackpot.\n\n=== \"Just the Jackpot\" option ===\n\nIn preparation for the October 28, 2017 format change the then-46 Mega Millions members were given the '''choice''' of offering a $3, two-game play (called \"Just the Jackpot\"). A player choosing this option is not eligible for any of the eight lower-tier prizes; therefore, the Megaplier option is not available for ''Just the Jackpot'' wagers.\n\nThese lotteries offered the \"Just the Jackpot\" option upon the format change: [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Indiana]], [[Kansas]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Nebraska]], [[New Jersey]], [[New Mexico]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Ohio]], [[South Dakota]], [[Texas]], [[Virginia]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Wyoming]]. [[Kentucky]] has since added \"Just the Jackpot\", with other lotteries potentially adding it. Not known is whether a second series of playslips would be printed for lotteries offering \"Just the Jackpot\" beginning after the October 28, 2017 format change.\n\n\"Just the Jackpot\" wagers and regular Mega Millions plays are printed on separate tickets. Most ''Just the Jackpot'' wagers are terminal-generated; however, ''JtJ'' wagers in Kansas and Texas allow the player to choose their numbers, while Wisconsin players must ask for a terminal-generated ticket.\n\nAs of January 2020, there has yet to be a jackpot winner from a ''Just the Jackpot'' wager; there also is no known count of ''JtJ'' wagers that would have won second prize (5+0) with a traditional Mega Millions play.\n\n=== Record jackpots ===\nThe largest Mega Millions jackpot, $1.537 billion, was won on October 23, 2018 by one ticket, sold in South Carolina. This prize, the largest for one set of numbers in world history, was the second largest lottery payout, behind Powerball's $1.586 billion jackpot won on January 13, 2016 by multiple tickets. The record Mega Millions jackpot was claimed on March 5, 2019, with the winner choosing to remain anonymous under South Carolina law.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2019/03/04/mystery-winner-finally-claims-billion-mega-millions-jackpot-ending-months-speculation/]</ref>\n\nThe second-largest Mega Millions jackpot advertised as $640 million at the time of the drawing (annuitized) or $462 million (cash value), was drawn on March 30, 2012. The initial estimate for that drawing (following the March 27 drawing, which was $363 million annuity) was $476 million (later increased to $500 million and again to $540 million); brisk ticket sales pushed the jackpot values, both annuitized (to $656 million) and the cash option ($474 million) higher. The amount spent on Mega Millions for drawings following its previous jackpot win, on January 24, 2012, was at least $1.5 [[1,000,000,000|billion]].<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=March 31, 2012 |title=Mega Millions mania leads to disappointment in California |author1=Matt Stevens |author2=Carol J.

(Neither ''Megaplier'' nor ''Power Play'' are offered in California because its [[California Penal Code|state penal code]] distinguishes between a \"lottery\" in which the bank cannot be \"broken\", and a \"banked game\" whose [[Breaking the bank|bank theoretically could be broken]]; only a \"lottery\" was authorized by the state Lottery Act.) By adding $1 to a basic Mega Millions game, to $3, a player has an opportunity to multiply any non-jackpot prize by 2, 3, 4, or 5. The ''Megaplier'' is drawn by the Texas Lottery (before the cross-sell expansion on January 31, 2010, it was the only lottery to offer ''Megaplier''), it is drawn by a [[random number generator]] (RNG).

Therefore, (75 x 74 x 73 x 72 x 71)/ (5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1) x 15 = 258,890,850, which means any combination of five white balls plus the Megaball has a 1:258,890,850 chance of winning the jackpot. Similarly, the odds for second prize were 1:(<sub>75</sub>C<sub>5</sub>) x (15/14) = 1: 18,492,204 chance of winning. The overall probability of winning any prize was 1 in 14.7. If there are no jackpot winners for a specific drawing, the jackpot will keep increasing; however, the odds will still remain the same.\n\nPayouts through October 18, 2013:\n{| cellspacing=3; class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|Matches<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n!rowspan=2|Prize\n!rowspan=2|Approximate probability of winning\n|-\n|White balls (pool of 56)\n|Mega Ball (pool of 46)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 5\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Jackpot<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n|1 in 175,711,536 (<sub>56</sub>C<sub>5</sub>\u00d746)<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%2856+choose+5%29*46\n| title = (56 choose 5)*46\n| accessdate = 2013-12-18 | date = 2013-12-18| publisher = [[Google]]\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/v/mega-millions-jackpot-probability |publisher=Khan Academy |title=Mega Millions Jackpot Probability |author=Sal Khan}}</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|5\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $250,000\n|1 in 3,904,701 (<sub>56</sub>C<sub>5</sub>\u00d746/45)<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%205%29*%2851%20choose%200%29*45%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 5)*(51 choose 0)*45) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $10,000\n|1 in 689,065<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%204%29*%2851%20choose%201%29%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 4)*(51 choose 1)) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $150\n|1 in 15,313<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%204%29*%2851%20choose%201%29*45%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 4)*(51 choose 1)*45) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $150\n|1 in 13,781<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%203%29*%2851%20choose%202%29%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 3)*(51 choose 2)) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $10\n|1 in 844<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%202%29*%2851%20choose%203%29%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 2)*(51 choose 3)) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $7\n|1 in 306<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%203%29*%2851%20choose%202%29*45%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 3)*(51 choose 2)*45) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $3\n|1 in 141<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%201%29*%2851%20choose%204%29%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 1)*(51 choose 4)) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $2\n|1 in 74.8 (the probability for this prize was not 1:46, because there is the possibility of matching at least one of the \"white\" balls, which decreases the likelihood of matching ''only'' the \"Mega Ball\")<ref name=MMHow />\n|}\n\nOverall probabilities: 1 in 755 of winning any of the top six prizes,<ref name=MMHow /> 1 in 40 of winning any prize.<ref name=\"Lotto numbers\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.lottonumbers.net/usa/megamillions/ |title=Lotto Numbers |access-date=2011-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212014739/http://www.lottonumbers.net/usa/megamillions/ |archive-date=2011-12-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn California, prize levels are paid on a [[parimutuel]] basis, rather than the fixed lower-tier amounts for winners in other Mega Millions jurisdictions.

Around the same time, for entirely different reasons, Ohio's governor also gave the green light to joining a multi-jurisdictional game. Both lotteries opted to join ''The Big Game'', which, at the time, was offered in seven states. The added populations of the two new jurisdictions, in turn, led to a larger double matrix. The first machine continued to hold white 52 balls, while 16 gold balls were added in the second, meaning there were 52 numbers to pick from in both parts of each $1 game. On May 15, 2002, the game was renamed ''The Big Game Mega Millions''; shortly after, it became just ''Mega Millions''. Except for the 2010 cross-selling expansion, this was the only time ''The Big Game'' or Mega Millions simultaneously added more than one member.\n\nIn 2005, Mega Millions was the target of a mailing scam. A letter bearing the Mega Millions logo was used in a string of lottery scams designed to trick people into providing personal financial information by cashing bogus checks. The letter, which had been sent to people in several states via standard mail, included a check for what the scammers said was an unclaimed Mega Millions prize. If the check was cashed, it bounced, but not before the bank stamped it with a routing number and personal account information and sent it back to the fraudulent organization, providing them with the recipients' financial information.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scamfraudalert.com/f23/mega-millions-logo-officials-warn-lottery-scams-5259/ |title=Mega Millions Logo Officials Warn of Lottery scams |publisher=ScamFraudAlert |date=2011-11-28 |accessdate=2011-12-21}}</ref>\n\nA budget impasse due to the [[2006 New Jersey Government shutdown]] led to the temporary closing of its non-essential agencies on July 1, 2006. Among the casualties were the [[Atlantic City]] casinos and the [[New Jersey Lottery]]. Not only were New Jersey's in-house games (such as [[New Jersey Pick 6|Pick-6]]) not drawn for about a week, but all New Jersey lottery terminals were shut down, meaning Mega Millions could not be played in New Jersey, even though Mega Millions was drawn as usual.

One such usage involved character [[Hugo \"Hurley\" Reyes]] playing the sequence in a similar \"Mega Lotto\" game, winning a nine-figure jackpot and subsequently experiencing numerous misfortunes in his personal life. The first three numbers (4, 8, 15) and mega ball (42) in the Mega Millions drawing matched the first three numbers and the final number (which Hurley also used as the \"mega ball\" number) in the ''Lost'' sequence. The last two numbers in the Mega Millions drawing did not match the last two numbers that were used in the scene.

Premier League|1992\u201393]] and also the worst since the introduction of the three points for a win rule. Among the records set by the Rams were:\n** A final record of one win, eight draws and 29 losses for a total of eleven points, worse than the [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] team from [[2005\u201306 FA Premier League|2005\u201306]], with the previously set lows of three wins, six draws and 29 losses totalling fifteen points. The single win, coming at home against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] 1\u20130 on 17 September was also a record for the fewest wins in a Premier League campaign\n** Derby's 20 goals scored as a team (with Ronaldo, Adebayor and Torres each scoring more goals individually) was lower than the [[2002\u201303 FA Premier League|2002\u201303]] Black Cats' total with 21 goals scored. This marked the third time a team was outscored by one or more players. The team also failed to score in 21 of their 38 games\n** Their \u221269 goal difference (20 goals scored, 89 conceded) was worse than [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]'s [[1994\u201395 FA Premier League|1994\u201395]] goal difference of \u221257 (36 goals scored, 93 conceded). The 89 goals they conceded was the worst defensive performance by a team since Ipswich Town conceded 93 goals in 1994\u201395. It was also the worst record since the Premier League adopted the 20-team, 38-match format in 1995\u201396\n** The 29 defeats they suffered equalled the 2005\u201306 Sunderland team for the most losses suffered in one Premier League season\n* Chelsea's 85 points accumulated was a new record for the most points gained in a 38-game season without securing the title. The 83 points achieved by Arsenal was a new record for the most points gained in a 38-game season for finishing third\n* Manchester United's goal difference of +58 was the greatest ever attained in a Premier League season, beating the record set by Chelsea in [[2004\u201305 FA Premier League|2004\u201305]]\n* [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] beat his own record for most goals scored by a midfielder, raising the record to 31 goals. The previous record was 17 goals, from the [[2006\u201307 FA Premier League|previous season]]. Furthermore, his goal total equalled the highest number of goals ever scored in the Premier League during a 38-game season, equalling the record first set by Blackburn Rovers' [[Alan Shearer]] during the [[1995\u201396 FA Premier League|1995\u201396 season]]\n* [[Marcus Bent]] and [[Roque Santa Cruz]] each scored a hat trick for their team during [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]]'s 5\u20133 victory over [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] on 15 December 2007. This is the first time in Premier League history that players from opposing sides both scored hat-tricks in the same match<ref name=ThreeHistory/>\n* [[Emmanuel Adebayor]] scored two hat tricks home and away against Derby. This was the first time in the Premier League that a player had scored a hat trick against the same team twice in the league\n* [[Fernando Torres]] scored 24 goals for Liverpool, a new record for goals scored by a foreign player during his debut season<ref>{{cite news |first=Martin |last=Isaacs |title= Fernando Torres breaks record in Liverpool win

Premier League|1992\u201393]] and also the worst since the introduction of the three points for a win rule. Among the records set by the Rams were:\n** A final record of one win, eight draws and 29 losses for a total of eleven points, worse than the [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] team from [[2005\u201306 FA Premier League|2005\u201306]], with the previously set lows of three wins, six draws and 29 losses totalling fifteen points. The single win, coming at home against [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] 1\u20130 on 17 September was also a record for the fewest wins in a Premier League campaign\n** Derby's 20 goals scored as a team (with Ronaldo, Adebayor and Torres each scoring more goals individually) was lower than the [[2002\u201303 FA Premier League|2002\u201303]] Black Cats' total with 21 goals scored. This marked the third time a team was outscored by one or more players. The team also failed to score in 21 of their 38 games\n** Their \u221269 goal difference (20 goals scored, 89 conceded) was worse than [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]'s [[1994\u201395 FA Premier League|1994\u201395]] goal difference of \u221257 (36 goals scored, 93 conceded). The 89 goals they conceded was the worst defensive performance by a team since Ipswich Town conceded 93 goals in 1994\u201395. It was also the worst record since the Premier League adopted the 20-team, 38-match format in 1995\u201396\n** The 29 defeats they suffered equalled the 2005\u201306 Sunderland team for the most losses suffered in one Premier League season\n* Chelsea's 85 points accumulated was a new record for the most points gained in a 38-game season without securing the title. The 83 points achieved by Arsenal was a new record for the most points gained in a 38-game season for finishing third\n* Manchester United's goal difference of +58 was the greatest ever attained in a Premier League season, beating the record set by Chelsea in [[2004\u201305 FA Premier League|2004\u201305]]\n* [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] beat his own record for most goals scored by a midfielder, raising the record to 31 goals. The previous record was 17 goals, from the [[2006\u201307 FA Premier League|previous season]]. Furthermore, his goal total equalled the highest number of goals ever scored in the Premier League during a 38-game season, equalling the record first set by Blackburn Rovers' [[Alan Shearer]] during the [[1995\u201396 FA Premier League|1995\u201396 season]]\n* [[Marcus Bent]] and [[Roque Santa Cruz]] each scored a hat trick for their team during [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]]'s 5\u20133 victory over [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] on 15 December 2007. This is the first time in Premier League history that players from opposing sides both scored hat-tricks in the same match<ref name=ThreeHistory/>\n* [[Emmanuel Adebayor]] scored two hat tricks home and away against Derby. This was the first time in the Premier League that a player had scored a hat trick against the same team twice in the league\n* [[Fernando Torres]] scored 24 goals for Liverpool, a new record for goals scored by a foreign player during his debut season<ref>{{cite news |first=Martin |last=Isaacs |title= Fernando Torres breaks record in Liverpool win

The town and the adjacent [[Port Qasim]] were named after [[Muhammad bin Qasim]], an Arab general who conquered large parts of [[Sindh]] in the eighth century CE. Bin Qasim was bordered by [[Gadap Town]] to the north, [[Thatta District]] and the [[Indus River]] to the east, the [[Arabian Sea]] to the south and the [[Malir River]] and the towns of [[Landhi Town|Landhi]], [[Malir Town|Malir]], and [[Korangi Cantonment]] to the west.  The town had a population of about 315,000 at the 1998 census, of which 97% were Muslim and include several ethnic groups \u2013 [[Sindhi people|Sindhis]] form majority in the town.

The effect in Karachi was the dissolution of the former [[Karachi Division]], and the merging of its five districts to form a new Karachi City-District with eighteen autonomous constituent towns including Bin Qasim Town. In 2011, the system was disbanded but remained in place for bureaucratic administration until 2015, when the [[Karachi Metropolitan Corporation]] system was reintroduced.

The town and the adjacent [[Port Qasim]] were named after [[Muhammad bin Qasim]], an Arab general who conquered large parts of [[Sindh]] in the eighth century CE. Bin Qasim was bordered by [[Gadap Town]] to the north, [[Thatta District]] and the [[Indus River]] to the east, the [[Arabian Sea]] to the south and the [[Malir River]] and the towns of [[Landhi Town|Landhi]], [[Malir Town|Malir]], and [[Korangi Cantonment]] to the west.  The town had a population of about 315,000 at the 1998 census, of which 97% were Muslim and include several ethnic groups \u2013 [[Sindhi people|Sindhis]] form majority in the town. The other ethnic groups inhabiting the town included [[Baloch people|Baloch]]s, [[Kashmir]]is, [[Seraikis]], [[Pashtun people|Pakhtuns]], [[Brahui people|Brahuis]], [[Muhajir (Pakistan)|Muhajirs]],  [[Punjabi people|Punjabis]], [[Memon people|Memons]], [[Mustaali|Bohras]] and [[Ismaili]]s.\n\n== History ==\nThe federal government under [[Pervez Musharraf]], who seized power in a [[1999 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat|1999 coup d'etat]], introduced local government reforms in the year 2000, which eliminated the previous \"third tier of government\" ([[Divisions of Pakistan|administrative divisions]]) and replaced it with the fourth tier ([[Districts of Pakistan|districts]]). The effect in Karachi was the dissolution of the former [[Karachi Division]], and the merging of its five districts to form a new Karachi City-District with eighteen autonomous constituent towns including Bin Qasim Town. In 2011, the system was disbanded but remained in place for bureaucratic administration until 2015, when the [[Karachi Metropolitan Corporation]] system was reintroduced. In 2015, Bin Qasim Town was re-organized as part of [[Malir District|Karachi Malir]] district.\n\n== Neighbourhoods of Bin Qasim Town ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Abdullah Goth]]\n* [[Cattle Colony]]\n* [[Gaghar]]\n* [[Green Park City]]\n* [[Gulshan-e-Hadeed]]\n* [[Ibrahim Hyderi]]\n* [[Landhi Colony]]\n* [[Mujahid Colony]]\n* [[Qaidabad|Quaidabad]]\n* [[Razzaqabad]]\n* [[Rehri Goth]]\n* [[Shah Latif Town]]\n* [[Sherpao Colony]]\n* [[Steel Town (Karachi)|Steel Town]]\n* [[Shah Bhitaie Town (Karachi)|Shah Bhitaie Town]]\n}}\n\n== Trade and industry ==\nThe port of [[Port Qasim|Bin Qasim]] was built in the 1970s to relieve pressure on the [[Port of Karachi]] and is today the second largest port of Pakistan.

It is a [[Video game remake|reboot]] of the ''[[Syndicate (series)|Syndicate]]'' series of [[real-time tactics|real-time]] [[tactical shooter]] games developed by [[Bullfrog Productions]]. The game was released in February 2012 worldwide. Set in the year 2069, the narrative revolves around Miles Kilo, a EuroCorp agent who must eliminate important personnel from rival corporations; in the process, he discovers the evil, secret practice used by EuroCorp to recruit agents. The game features a large variety of weapons; from standard pistols to the futuristic guns. Kilo is implanted with a [[Integrated circuit|computer chip]] that allows him to access the [[dataverse]] and can use [[hacker (programmer subculture)|hacking]] to defeat enemies and solve environmental puzzles.\n\nPre-production of the game began in 2007. Electronic Arts approached Starbreeze Studios to revive the franchise because it was impressed with the quality of Starbreeze Studios' previous games and believed they could add \"style\" to the series. The game was returned to the drawing board after a year of development, and the co-operative multiplayer mode was added to the main game. The development team hoped the game would appeal to both newcomers and players of the original game; they maintained the theme of the original and drastically changed the gameplay. [[Richard K. Morgan]] was hired to write the story for the game.\n\nAnnounced in September 2011, the game was released in February 2012 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]]. The game received generally positive reviews from critics upon release. Critics praised the gameplay, style, graphics, art direction, artificial intelligence and the co-operative mode, but the game's story was criticized. The game's budget was smaller than typical [[AAA (video game industry)|AAA video game]], and was considered as a commercial failure for the publisher. The game's excessive violence led to the game being banned in Australia.\n\n==Gameplay==\nUnlike the original series of games, ''Syndicate'' is a [[first-person shooter]] set in 2069. Players assume control of Miles Kilo, an augmented agent working for EuroCorp in a corrupted, deceitful world in which corporations compete with each other for power.<ref>{{cite web|title=It's official: Syndicate reboot confirmed for early 2012|url=http://www.vg247.com/2011/09/12/syndicate-confirmed-at-last/|accessdate=12 September 2011|first=Brenna|last=Hillier|work=[[VG247]]|date=12 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927012452/http://www.vg247.com/2011/09/12/syndicate-confirmed-at-last/|archive-date=27 September 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Players can run, jump, slide, hide behind covers, and carry two weapons and grenades to defeat enemies and [[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]], who each have unique abilities.<ref name=\"GT\"/> The game features 19 weapons,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/syndicate/b/xbox360/archive/2011/12/01/starbreeze-studio-39-s-new-arsenal-hits-syndication.aspx|title=Syndicate: Starbreeze Studio's New Arsenal Hits Syndication|first=Matt|last=Bertz|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=1 December 2011|accessdate=2 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208133630/http://www.gameinformer.com/games/syndicate/b/xbox360/archive/2011/12/01/starbreeze-studio-39-s-new-arsenal-hits-syndication.aspx|archive-date=8 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> ranging from assault rifles, rocket launchers and machine pistols, to futuristic weapons such as laser rifles, Gauss Guns with bullets that can track enemies automatically, and Riotlance Dark Shooters that can paralyze enemies for a short time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uuHXZxSRZc|title=Syndicate - Assassinations and Future Weapons - The Gun Show|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=27 February 2012|accessdate=2 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518161251/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uuHXZxSRZc|archive-date=18 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Weapons can be customized and upgraded with 87 attachments and 25 upgrade options.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2011/12/01/syndicate-weapons-trailer-and-screens-released-co-op-shots-land-as-well/|title=Syndicate weapons trailer and screens released, co-op shots land as well|first=Stephany|last=Nunneley|work=[[VG247]]|date=1 December 2011|accessdate=2 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117031921/http://www.vg247.com/2011/12/01/syndicate-weapons-trailer-and-screens-released-co-op-shots-land-as-well/|archive-date=17 November 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> These upgrades may alter the nature of these weapons, transforming standard ammunition to cover-penetrating ammunition.<ref name=\"PlayStation\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2012/02/01/welcome-to-the-ps3-demo-of-syndicate/|title=Welcome To The PS3 Demo Of Syndicate!|first=Andrea|last=Gschwari|date=1 February 2012|accessdate=2 November 2015|work=[[PlayStation Blog]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117031455/http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2012/02/01/welcome-to-the-ps3-demo-of-syndicate/|archive-date=17 November 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The game also features an \"execution\" mechanic, allowing players to perform melee takedowns.<ref name=\"GRadar Know\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/syndicate-first-look-preview-5-reasons-both-excited-and-worried-about-classic-series-reboot/|title=Syndicate first look preview: 5 reasons we\u2019re both excited and worried about this classic series reboot|first=Charlie|last=Barratt|date=29 September 2011|accessdate=2 November 2015|work=[[GamesRadar]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117030013/http://www.gamesradar.com/syndicate-first-look-preview-5-reasons-both-excited-and-worried-about-classic-series-reboot/|archive-date=17 November 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Syndicate 2012 screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|The player is trying to hack an enemy]]\nMiles has a \"DART-6\" [[integrated circuit|chip]] that grants him hacking and \"breaching\" abilities.

In 2025, EuroCorp releases the DART chip, a [[neural implant]] that allows users to access the ''dataverse'', making most electronic devices obsolete. As a result of the DART chip, the world is no longer ruled by national governments but by [[Megacorporation|mega-corporations]] known as \"Syndicates\". However, only half of the world's population embrace the chip; the \"unchipped\" are abandoned and denied the benefits afforded by their chipped counterparts. [[Corporate espionage]] and [[corporate warfare]] for dominance between syndicates becomes the norm, resulting in the creation of \"agents\"\u2014bio-engineered enforcers augmented by a militarized version of the chip who protect the interests of their corporate masters.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Syndicate|developer=[[Electronic Arts]]|date=21 February 2012| platforms =[[Microsoft Windows]], [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 3]]|quote=}}</ref>\n\n===Plot===\nIn 2069, Agent Miles Kilo, EuroCorp's latest agent, is equipped with the new prototype DART 6 chip created by Eurocorp scientist Lily Drawl (voiced by [[Rosario Dawson]]). After a successful test run of the chip's abilities, EuroCorp CEO Jack Denham (voiced by [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]]) assigns him to kill Lily's counterpart, Chang, at the rival syndicate Aspari. Accompanied by his mentor Agent Jules Merit (voiced by [[Michael Wincott]]), Kilo attacks the Los Angeles branch of Aspari and corners Chang, who shoots himself. Kilo retrieves Chang's chip and learns from an encrypted conversation that Lily has been sharing information about the DART 6 chip with him.\n\nAlthough shocked by Lily's betrayal, Denham decides to have Kilo and Merit keep Lily under surveillance because she is too valuable to eliminate. As they observe her in her apartment, Lily has an argument with a person named Kris before she is suddenly kidnapped by the syndicate Cayman-Global. Kilo fights off the Cayman-Global forces and follows Lily's abductors to their [[Seasteading|floating base]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Kilo kills a major Cayman-Global agent and rescues Lily, and they learn the syndicate is preparing a war against EuroCorp.\n\nIn New York, Kilo and Lily land in the Downzone where the unchipped, lower-class population lives. After they split up and head towards EuroCorp HQ, Kilo is betrayed by Lily and is sent into a trap with [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] mines, injuring him and disabling his chips. After his chips regain function, Kilo is given orders to either capture or kill Lily. After fighting off subverters, Kilo learns their leader Kris\u2014Lily's ex-boyfriend and colleague\u2014is responsible for instigating a war between the syndicates. Kris reveals he started the war so he could hack into the dataverse and kill the syndicates and their chipped populations as punishment for abandoning the unchipped. Lily, who wants to find a peaceful solution and make the syndicates care about the unchipped, opposes the idea. Kilo fights Kris, who attempts to [[Suicide attack|suicide bomb]] him but kills himself instead. Kilo apprehends Lily; he can either kill her or release her. Lily is captured and a barely-alive Kilo is retrieved.{{efn|If Kilo tries to kill her, a kill switch installed to prevent exactly that stops him, and if Kilo lets her go, he is stunned by a grenade, severely injuring him.}}\n\nAt EuroCorp New York HQ, Denham and Merit believe Kilo is brain-dead and send him to be rebooted while they plan to retrieve Lily's chip and recover useful information on DART 6. Kilo begins to remember his secret past: he learns that Denham led a EuroCorp team to kill his parents and abduct him as a baby because he has genes ideal for becoming an agent. Kilo escapes from his restraints and rescues Lily, who tells Kilo that like him, all of EuroCorp's agents were abducted as children and their memories were modified so they would remain loyal to EuroCorp. Lily created the DART 6 chip, hoping to use it to make the syndicates retain their humanity and care about both chipped and un-chipped civilians, but she realizes she was na\u00efve to think that way.\n\nAs Cayman-Global attacks EuroCorp's New York HQ, Kilo and Lily head towards Denham's office to prevent him from activating the kill switch on their DART chips. Kilo has to fight off both EuroCorp and Cayman-Global forces, as well as several EuroCorp agents. At the top of the tower, he is forced to fight Merit and two other agents, who are under Denham's orders to kill him. Kilo defeats the agents, and overpowers and kills Merit. Kilo then heads towards Denham's office but finds Denham has activated his kill switch, which starts to affect Kilo's movements. Weakened, Kilo confronts Denham, who justifies abducting him as a child. Kilo manages to fight against the kill-switch order and corners Denham, who lets himself fall over a ledge to his death. As the game ends, EuroCorp lies in ruins and Lily gives Kilo a pistol, telling him that he is free from anyone's control.\n\n==Development==\n[[Syndicate (video game)|The original version of ''Syndicate'']] is a [[tactical shooter]] developed by [[Bullfrog Productions]] and produced by [[Peter Molyneux]] in 1993. Electronic Arts had wanted to make a new ''Syndicate'' game for several years but had not found an opportunity to do so. They hoped to bring new elements and drastically altered gameplay concepts that would suit the franchise's universe.

The team ensured the game had its own style that would differentiate itself from other games. This was achieved by using a \"split-world aspect\", which divided the game's into two areas, each with a different artstyle. The team added details and aesthetics to the game's three syndicates in the upper zone so they would easily be recognized and be different from each another. \"The Downzone\", where non-implanted poor people live, has a different design from the three syndicates. The team took ideas for this area from ''[[Mirror's Edge]]''.<ref name=\"IGN\"/> Both sides were inspired by futuristic films such as ''[[Blade Runner]]'', ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' and ''[[Gattaca]]''. In addition, the split-world concept applies to the gameplay. The Downzone enemies tend to be more aggressive and anti-agents, and some gameplay segments such as the breaching system are inapplicable in such areas.{{efn|The enemies in the Downzone area do not have chips implanted in their heads.

The team aimed to maintain a consistent visual quality on all the platforms on which the game was released, even though the PC version had the advantage of  higher [[Image resolution|resolution]] and [[frame rate]].

The game's story received mixed responses. The reviewer from [[GameTrailers]] called the plot predictable and considered several of the game's plot points boring. He praised the game's dialogue for its flow and the backstory presented. The reviewer said the campaign lacked scale but was nevertheless enjoyable and worthwhile playing. He also said the celebrity-led voice cast had successfully brought \"believability\" to the game.<ref name=\"GT\"/> This was echoed by [[Jeff Gerstmann]] from [[Giant Bomb]].<ref name=\"GBRev\"/> In contrast, Martin Gaston from VideoGamer.com said he was disappointed with the campaign and considered it one of the game's biggest flaws. He said the world deserves more exploration than it had in ''Syndicate'', and that the development team did not seem to understand the creative vision of the first version of the game. He also said the emphasis on morals did not excel because it does not fit the game's overall style. He disliked the game's protagonist, who he thought was bland, making him difficult for players to relate to.<ref name=\"VGRev\"/> Xav De Matos from [[Joystiq]] said the story is filled with promises but the overall product failed to differentiate itself from other shooters with similar themes.<ref name=\"JoystiqRev\"/> Dan Whitehead from [[Eurogamer]] compared it unfavourably to its predecessors and called it unambitious and uninspiring.<ref name=\"EuroG\"/>\n\nThe overall gameplay received praise. Gaston described the shooting as \"clever\" and said the DART-6 breaching abilities have encouraged players to experiment. He said the combination of the breaching system and gunfights made ''Syndicate'' better than some other contemporaneous first-person shooters.<ref name=\"VGRev\"/> GameTrailers' reviewer said the DART-6 system provides players with choice and the recharge time of the breaching abilities tasks players with managing a \"micro-economy\" that encourages and rewards skills.<ref name=\"GT\"/> Both Gaston and GameTrailers said the game missed out opportunities for limiting the use of some of Kilo's powers, which are only shown in cutscenes. Gerstmann liked the game's gameplay and said the control was fun, and that he appreciated the ability to shoot while running. He also admired the breaching abilities and found them satisfying to use.<ref name=\"GBRev\"/> Whitehead shared similar thoughts, saying the breaching abilities tasks players with deploying strategy and make the game deeper than typical [[run and gun (video game)|run-and-gun]] video games.<ref name=\"EuroG\"/>\n\nThe game's AI received praise. GameTrailers' reviewer said enemies \"know how to die in style\" and that the boss fights are memorable, even though they can be repetitive.<ref name=\"GT\"/> Gaston considered it \"missed opportunities\".<ref name=\"VGRev\"/> De Matos appreciated the boss fights and said it was fun and interesting, and tasks players with learning the pattern of these boss fights and using the correct skill to defeat them.<ref name=\"JoystiqRev\"/>\n\n[[File:Syndicate 2012 bloom.jpg|thumb|left|An example of the game's [[Bloom (shader effect)|bloom]] effect, which was criticized]]\n\nReviewers praised the game's graphical quality. Gerstmann said the use of lighting added a unique style to the game. He also liked the depiction of the two major areas of the game, and the game's sounds, which he said suited the tone of the game.<ref name=\"GBRev\"/> Alexandra Hall from [[GamesRadar]] said \"Starbreeze really coaxed some beautiful sights out of aging hardware\". She added that some players may not be pleased with the game's bloom effects.<ref name=\"Gradar\"/> David Houghton of the same publication said the game is \"a decent shooter\" but that its lightbloom effects were \"nonsensically over-the-top\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/56-eye-melting-screens-most-hilariously-over-the-top-bloom-lighting-in-video-game-history/|title=56 eye-melting screens of the most hilariously over-the-top bloom lighting in video game history|last=Houghton|first=David|date=8 March 2012|work=[[GamesRadar]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|accessdate=21 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131223130438/http://www.gamesradar.com/56-eye-melting-screens-most-hilariously-over-the-top-bloom-lighting-in-video-game-history/|archive-date=23 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Peter Eykemans from [[IGN]] echoed similar thoughts, declaring that the motion bloom and blinding light a problem. However, he admitted that the game \"constantly looks great\", and that its simple design has made the game to look very polished.<ref name=\"IGNRev\"/>\n\nThe four-player, co-operative, multiplayer mode received acclaim. Gaston said it was a \"watered down version of ''[[Left 4 Dead]]''\", but it was nonetheless a fun and pleasant experience for most players.<ref name=\"VGRev\"/> De Matos said the game had encouraged players to work together to defeat enemies and to plan before attacking, which he said had turned the mode to a \"gratifying\" experience. He criticized the game's difficulty, which he said does not scale well, and the scripted enemies, which made the game less dynamic.<ref name=\"JoystiqRev\"/> Whitehead highly recommended the co-operative mode, which he thought should have been the game's main focus. He added that it provided more freedom to the players than the campaign.<ref name=\"EuroG\"/>\n\nCritics had mixed feelings about the game. Gerstmann said he had an \"outstanding time\" with it, and that it had offered an excellent twist to the genre.<ref name=\"GBRev\"/> De Matos said it had successfully branched out the franchise to a new direction, even though it may not be what players of the original ''Syndicate'' would expect. However, he said the spirit of the franchise is still maintained and preserved.<ref name=\"JoystiqRev\"/> Gaston said Starbreeze was not able to capture the franchise's vision and that the game was not well-executed overall.<ref name=\"VGRev\"/> Whitehead described the game as \"fun\", even though he thought ''Syndicate'' was a forgettable experience that will live under the shadow of rival shooters.<ref name=\"EuroG\"/>\n\n''[[Syndicate Wars]]'' producer and lead programmer Mike Diskett criticized the game stating that it was \"nothing like the original games.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Diskett |first1=Mike |title=Satellite Reign Kickstarter Video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etkjrmHMm_o |website=YouTube |accessdate=1 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927030644/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etkjrmHMm_o |archive-date=27 September 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> This encouraged him to make a spiritual successor to Syndicate Wars called ''[[Satellite Reign]]'', which was a [[Kickstarter]] success.\n\n===Sales===\nIn an interview with ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'', [[Frank Gibeau]] of EA said the ''Syndicate'' revival had not been as successful as had been hoped, saying, \"''Syndicate'' was something that we took a risk on.

It is a [[Video game remake|reboot]] of the ''[[Syndicate (series)|Syndicate]]'' series of [[real-time tactics|real-time]] [[tactical shooter]] games developed by [[Bullfrog Productions]]. The game was released in February 2012 worldwide. Set in the year 2069, the narrative revolves around Miles Kilo, an EuroCop agent who must eliminate important personnel from rival corporations; in the process, he discovers the evil, secret practice used by EuroCorp to recruit agents. The game features a large variety of weapons; from standard pistols to the futuristic guns. Kilo is implanted with a [[Integrated circuit|computer chip]] that allows him to access the [[dataverse]] and can use [[hacker (programmer subculture)|hacking]] to defeat enemies and solve environmental puzzles.\n\nPre-production of the game began in 2007. Electronic Arts approached Starbreeze Studios to revive the franchise because it was impressed with the quality of Starbreeze Studios'  previous games and believed they could add \"style\" to the series. The game was returned to the drawing board after a year of development, and the co-operative multiplayer mode was added to the main game. The development team hoped the game would appeal to both newcomers and players of the original game; they maintained the theme of the original and drastically changed the gameplay. [[Richard K. Morgan]] was hired to write the story for the game.\n\nAnnounced in September 2011, the game was released in February 2012 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]]. The game received generally positive reviews from critics upon release. Critics praised the gameplay, style, graphics, art direction, artificial intelligence and the co-operative mode, but the game's story was criticized.

In 2025, EuroCorp releases the DART chip, a [[neural implant]] that allows users to access the ''dataverse'', making most electronic devices obsolete. As a result of the DART chip, the world is no longer ruled by national governments but by [[Megacorporation|mega-corporations]] known as \"Syndicates\". However, only half of the world's population embrace the chip; the \"unchipped\" are abandoned and denied the benefits afforded by their chipped counterparts. [[Corporate espionage]] and [[corporate warfare]] for dominance between syndicates becomes the norm, resulting in the creation of \"agents\"\u2014bio-engineered enforcers augmented by a militarized version of the chip who protect the interests of their corporate masters.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Syndicate|developer=[[Electronic Arts]]|date=21 February 2012| platforms =[[Microsoft Windows]], [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 3]]|quote=}}</ref>\n\n===Plot===\nIn 2069, Agent Miles Kilo, EuroCorp's latest agent, is equipped with the new prototype DART 6 chip created by Eurocorp scientist Lily Drawl (voiced by [[Rosario Dawson]]). After a successful test run of the chip's abilities, EuroCorp CEO Jack Denham (voiced by [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]]) assigns him to kill Lily's counterpart, Chang, at the rival syndicate Aspari. Accompanied by his mentor Agent Jules Merit (voiced by [[Michael Wincott]]), Kilo attacks the Los Angeles branch of Aspari and corners Chang, who shoots himself. Kilo retrieves Chang's chip and learns from an encrypted conversation that Lily has been sharing information about the DART 6 chip with him.\n\nAlthough shocked by Lily's betrayal, Denham decides to have Kilo and Merit keep Lily under surveillance because she is too valuable to eliminate. As they observe her in her apartment, Lily has an argument with a person named Kris before she is suddenly kidnapped by the syndicate Cayman-Global. Kilo fights off the Cayman-Global forces and follows Lily's abductors to their [[Seasteading|floating base]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Kilo kills a major Cayman-Global agent and rescues Lily, and they learn the syndicate is preparing a war against EuroCorp.\n\nIn New York, Kilo and Lily land in the Downzone where the unchipped, lower-class population lives. After they split up and head towards EuroCorp HQ, Kilo is betrayed by Lily and is sent into a trap with [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] mines, injuring him and disabling his chips. After his chips regain function, Kilo is given orders to either capture or kill Lily. After fighting off subverters, Kilo learns their leader Kris\u2014Lily's ex-boyfriend and colleague\u2014is responsible for instigating a war between the syndicates. Kris reveals he started the war so he could hack into the dataverse and kill the syndicates and their chipped populations as punishment for abandoning the unchipped. Lily, who wants to find a peaceful solution and make the syndicates care about the unchipped, opposes the idea. Kilo fights Kris, who attempts to [[Suicide attack|suicide bomb]] him but kills himself instead. Kilo apprehends Lily; he can either kill her or release her. Lily is captured and a barely-alive Kilo is retrieved.{{efn|If Kilo tries to kill her, a kill switch installed to prevent exactly that stops him, and if Kilo lets her go, he is stunned by a grenade, severely injuring him.}}\n\nAt EuroCorp New York HQ, Denham and Merit believe Kilo is brain-dead and send him to be rebooted while they plan to retrieve Lily's chip and recover useful information on DART 6. Kilo begins to remember his secret past: he learns that Denham led a EuroCorp team to kill his parents and abduct him as a baby because he has genes ideal for becoming an agent. Kilo escapes from his restraints and rescues Lily, who tells Kilo that like him, all of EuroCorp's agents were abducted as children and their memories were modified so they would remain loyal to EuroCorp. Lily created the DART 6 chip, hoping to use it to make the syndicates retain their humanity and care about both chipped and un-chipped civilians, but she realizes she was na\u00efve to think that way.\n\nAs Cayman-Global attacks EuroCorp's New York HQ, Kilo and Lily head towards Denham's office to prevent him from activating the kill switch on their DART chips. Kilo has to fight off both EuroCorp and Cayman-Global forces, as well as several EuroCorp agents. At the top of the tower, he is forced to fight Merit and two other agents, who are under Denham's orders to kill him. Kilo defeats the agents, and overpowers and kills Merit. Kilo then heads towards Denham's office but finds Denham has activated his kill switch, which starts to affect Kilo's movements. Weakened, Kilo confronts Denham, who justifies abducting him as a child. Kilo manages to fight against the kill-switch order and corners Denham, who lets himself fall over a ledge to his death. As the game ends, EuroCorp lies in ruins and Lily gives Kilo a pistol, telling him that he is free from anyone's control.\n\n==Development==\n[[Syndicate (video game)|The original version of ''Syndicate'']] is a [[tactical shooter]] developed by [[Bullfrog Productions]] and produced by [[Peter Molyneux]] in 1993. Electronic Arts had wanted to make a new ''Syndicate'' game for several years but had not found an opportunity to do so.

The team ensured the game had its own style that would differentiate itself from other games. This was achieved by using a \"split-world aspect\", which divided the game's into two areas, each with a different artstyle. The team added details and aesthetics to the game's three syndicates in the upper zone so they would easily be recognized and be different from each another. \"The Downzone\", where non-implanted poor people live, has a different design from the three syndicates. The team took ideas for this area from ''[[Mirror's Edge]]''.<ref name=\"IGN\"/> Both sides were inspired by futuristic films such as ''[[Blade Runner]]'', ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' and ''[[Gattaca]]''. In addition, the split-world concept applies to the gameplay. The Downzone enemies tend to be more aggressive and anti-agents, and some gameplay segments such as the breaching system are inapplicable in such areas.{{efn|The enemies in the Downzone area do not have chips implanted in their heads.

The game's story received mixed responses. The reviewer from [[GameTrailers]] called the plot predictable and considered several of the game's plot points boring. He praised the game's dialogue for its flow and the backstory presented. The reviewer said the campaign lacked scale but was nevertheless enjoyable and worthwhile playing. He also said the celebrity-led voice cast had successfully brought \"believability\" to the game.<ref name=\"GT\"/> This was echoed by [[Jeff Gerstmann]] from [[Giant Bomb]].<ref name=\"GBRev\"/> In contrast, Martin Gaston from VideoGamer.com said he was disappointed with the campaign and considered it one of the game's biggest flaws. He said the world deserves more exploration than it had in ''Syndicate'', and that the development team did not seem to understand the creative vision of the first version of the game. He also said the emphasis on morals did not excel because it does not fit the game's overall style. He disliked the game's protagonist, who he thought was bland, making him difficult for players to relate to.<ref name=\"VGRev\"/> Xav De Matos from [[Joystiq]] said the story is filled with promises but the overall product failed to differentiate itself from other shooters with similar themes.<ref name=\"JoystiqRev\"/> Dan Whitehead from [[Eurogamer]] compared it unfavourably to its predecessors and called it unambitious and uninspiring.<ref name=\"EuroG\"/>\n\nThe overall gameplay received praise. Gaston described the shooting as \"clever\" and said the DART-6 breaching abilities have encouraged players to experiment. He said the combination of the breaching system and gunfights made ''Syndicate'' better than some other contemporaneous first-person shooters.<ref name=\"VGRev\"/> GameTrailers' reviewer said the DART-6 system provides players with choice and the recharge time of the breaching abilities tasks players with managing a \"micro-economy\" that encourages and rewards skills.<ref name=\"GT\"/> Both Gaston and GameTrailers said the game missed out opportunities for limiting the use of some of Kilo's powers, which are only shown in cutscenes. Gerstmann liked the game's gameplay and said the control was fun, and that he appreciated the ability to shoot while running. He also admired the breaching abilities and found them satisfying to use.<ref name=\"GBRev\"/> Whitehead shared similar thoughts, saying the breaching abilities tasks players with deploying strategy and make the game deeper than typical [[run and gun (video game)|run-and-gun]] video games.<ref name=\"EuroG\"/>\n\nThe game's AI received praise. GameTrailers' reviewer said enemies \"know how to die in style\" and that the boss fights are memorable, even though they can be repetitive.<ref name=\"GT\"/> Gaston considered it \"missed opportunities\".<ref name=\"VGRev\"/> De Matos appreciated the boss fights and said it was fun and interesting, and tasks players with learning the pattern of these boss fights and using the correct skill to defeat them.<ref name=\"JoystiqRev\"/>\n\n[[File:Syndicate 2012 bloom.jpg|thumb|left|An example of the game's [[Bloom (shader effect)|bloom]] effect, which was criticized]]\n\nReviewers praised the game's graphical quality.

However, he admitted that the game \"constantly looks great\", and that its simple design has made the game to look very polished.<ref name=\"IGNRev\"/>\n\nThe four-player, co-operative, multiplayer mode received acclaim. Gaston said it was a \"watered down version of ''[[Left 4 Dead]]''\", but it was nonetheless a fun and pleasant experience for most players.<ref name=\"VGRev\"/> De Matos said the game had encouraged players to work together to defeat enemies and to plan before attacking, which he said had turned the mode to a \"gratifying\" experience. He criticized the game's difficulty, which he said does not scale well, and the scripted enemies, which made the game less dynamic.<ref name=\"JoystiqRev\"/> Whitehead highly recommended the co-operative mode, which he thought should have been the game's main focus. He added that it provided more freedom to the players than the campaign.<ref name=\"EuroG\"/>\n\nCritics had mixed feelings about the game. Gerstmann said he had an \"outstanding time\" with it, and that it had offered an excellent twist to the genre.<ref name=\"GBRev\"/> De Matos said it had successfully branched out the franchise to a new direction, even though it may not be what players of the original ''Syndicate'' would expect. However, he said the spirit of the franchise is still maintained and preserved.<ref name=\"JoystiqRev\"/> Gaston said Starbreeze was not able to capture the franchise's vision and that the game was not well-executed overall.<ref name=\"VGRev\"/> Whitehead described the game as \"fun\", even though he thought ''Syndicate'' was a forgettable experience that will live under the shadow of rival shooters.<ref name=\"EuroG\"/>\n\n''[[Syndicate Wars]]'' producer and lead programmer Mike Diskett criticized the game stating that it was \"nothing like the original games.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Diskett |first1=Mike |title=Satellite Reign Kickstarter Video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etkjrmHMm_o |website=YouTube |accessdate=1 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927030644/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etkjrmHMm_o |archive-date=27 September 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> This encouraged him to make a spiritual successor to Syndicate Wars called ''[[Satellite Reign]]'', which was a [[Kickstarter]] success.\n\n===Sales===\nIn an interview with ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'', [[Frank Gibeau]] of EA said the ''Syndicate'' revival had not been as successful as had been hoped, saying, \"''Syndicate'' was something that we took a risk on.

That was followed by land issued to Alan Robinet in 1822. In 1863, Orangeville was named after Orange Lawrence, a businessman born in Connecticut in 1796 who owned several mills in the village. As a young man, he moved to Canada and settled in Halton County. During [[Upper Canada Rebellion|Mackenzie's rebellion]] in 1837, he was a captain in the militia. Lawrence purchased the land that became Orangeville from Robert Hughson.<ref>Source: The Orangeville Banner, March 8, 1951</ref> Orange Lawrence committed suicide December 15, 1861.<ref>{{cite web |title=Orange Lawrence |url=https://www.geni.com/people/Orange-Lawrence/6000000011198110820 |website=geni.com |accessdate=18 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Former residents of Orange Lawrence\u2019s historic home learn how he died 156 years later|url=https://www.orangeville.com/community-story/7995765-former-residents-of-orange-lawrence-s-historic-home-learn-how-he-died-156-years-later/|website=orangeville.com |accessdate=16 December 2018}}</ref> In 1873, the Act of Incorporation was passed and Orangeville was given town status on January 1, 1874.  The public library, located at Broadway and Mill Street, was completed in 1908. [[Andrew Carnegie]], well-known businessman and philanthropist, provided financial assistance for its construction.\n\n==Economy==\nOrangeville serves as an administrative and commercial hub for Dufferin County, the northern portion of [[Regional Municipality of Peel|Peel Region]] and the surrounding area. Orangeville's downtown core is home to several retail stores, and there is a cluster of [[big-box store]]s in the Fairgrounds Shopping Centre. Many residents in and around Orangeville also commute to other areas of the [[Greater Toronto Area]] for work.\n\nThere are a number of manufacturing plants located in the town. Major industrial employers include Greening Donald (automotive airbag components), Resolve Corporation (computer outsourcing), [[Clorox]] Company of Canada ([[Glad (company)|Glad]] garbage bags), Relizon Canada (pressure-sensitive labels), Rochling Engineering Plastics (formerly Symplastics Limited) (plastic sheets) and Sanoh Canada (automotive components). Orangeville is also the main banking center for residents in the area.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[Image:Orangeville town hall nov 5 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Orangeville Town Hall.]]\nThe main intersection in the heart of the town is Broadway (formerly [[Ontario Highway 9]]) and First Street. [[Ontario Highway 10|Highway 10]] runs through Orangeville on its east side.\n\nBeginning in 2005, a major roadwork project was initiated to resurface Broadway through Orangeville. The downtown section was completed in early 2006, with extensive work still to be done on the west end in late 2006. In conjunction with this project, there was another one completed in late 2006 that involved building large planters in the middle of Broadway through the downtown section between First and Third Streets (West - East). The project was controversial, as safety concerns had been raised by the Fire Department because the new concrete planters in the middle of the road have made the rights of way too narrow for fire trucks to properly set up in case of a fire in a downtown building.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nConstruction of the South Arterial Road, often referred to as the 'Orangeville by-pass', was completed on August 3, 2005.<ref>{{cite web |title=Certificates and Notices Under the Construction Lien Act |url=http://dcnonl.com/csp/63985 |website=Daily Commercial News and Construction Record |publisher=Reed Business Information a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. |accessdate=18 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728133034/http://dcnonl.com/csp/63985 |archivedate=28 July 2011 |date=September 2, 2005}}</ref> The road runs from east to west, connecting [[Ontario Highway 10|Highway 10]] and County Road 109 (formerly [[Ontario Highway 9|Highway 9]]). Much of the eastern stretch runs through the Town of [[Caledon, Ontario|Caledon]], but officially enters into Orangeville at the Townline Road controlled intersection.\n\n[[Aecon]] Construction and Materials Limited was the successful bidder for the Design Build project with a price of $9.8 million. The project was completed in conjunction with Brampton-based Armbro Construction, TSH Engineers Architects Planners, Peto MacCallum Ltd. and Gartner Lee Ltd.\n\n[[Orangeville Transit]] is the town's own public transit system, and there is a commuter [[GO Transit]] bus service to [[Brampton]]. In the early 1990s, preliminary plans were drawn up for GO Transit rail service to Orangeville. However, it never got past the drawing board.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nIndustries in Orangeville are served by the [[Orangeville Brampton Railway]], which purchased {{convert|55|km|abbr=out}} of surplus track from the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]. The railway connects with the CPR in Streetsville, and also services customers in Brampton to the south. From 2004 to 2018, a tourist train was operated on weekends in summer months.\n\nIn 1906, survey work was underway for an electric railway line which would serve Orangeville, to be called the Huron and Ontario Electric Railway.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dipping Into the Past - Survey under way for electric railway across Dufferin |url=http://www.citizen.on.ca/news/2006/1123/Columns/045.html |publisher=Orangeville Citizen |accessdate=18 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203233059/http://www.citizen.on.ca/news/2006/1123/Columns/045.html |archivedate=3 February 2009 |date=November 23, 2006}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Historical populations\n|type        = Canada\n|align       = right\n|width       =\n|state       =\n|shading     =\n|percentages =\n|footnote    =\n|1871|1458\n|1881|2847\n|1891|2962\n|1901|2511\n|[[Canada 1911 Census|1911]]|2340\n|1921|2187\n|1931|2614\n|1941|2718\n|1951|3249\n|1961|4593\n|1971|8074\n|1981|13740\n|1991|17921\n|[[Canada 1996 Census|1996]]|21498\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]|25248\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]|26925\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]|27975\n| [[Canada 2016 Census|2016]] | 28900\n}}\n\nAccording to the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 Canadian Census]],<ref name=cp2016/> the population of Orangeville is 28,900, a 3.3% increase from 2011, with a {{PAGR|2011|27975|2016|28900}} per annum average growth rate over the same period.

That was followed by land issued to Alan Robinet in 1822. In 1863, Orangeville was named after Orange Lawrence, a businessman born in Connecticut in 1796 who owned several mills in the village. As a young man, he moved to Canada and settled in Halton County. During [[Upper Canada Rebellion|Mackenzie's rebellion]] in 1837, he was a captain in the militia. Lawrence purchased the land that became Orangeville from Robert Hughson.<ref>Source: The Orangeville Banner, March 8, 1951</ref> Orange Lawrence committed suicide December 15, 1861.<ref>{{cite web |title=Orange Lawrence |url=https://www.geni.com/people/Orange-Lawrence/6000000011198110820 |website=geni.com |accessdate=18 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Former residents of Orange Lawrence\u2019s historic home learn how he died 156 years later|url=https://www.orangeville.com/community-story/7995765-former-residents-of-orange-lawrence-s-historic-home-learn-how-he-died-156-years-later/|website=orangeville.com |accessdate=16 December 2018}}</ref> In 1873, the Act of Incorporation was passed and Orangeville was given town status on January 1, 1874.  The public library, located at Broadway and Mill Street, was completed in 1908. [[Andrew Carnegie]], well-known businessman and philanthropist, provided financial assistance for its construction.\n\n==Economy==\nOrangeville serves as an administrative and commercial hub for Dufferin County, the northern portion of [[Regional Municipality of Peel|Peel Region]] and the surrounding area. Orangeville's downtown core is home to several retail stores, and there is a cluster of [[big-box store]]s in the Fairgrounds Shopping Centre. Many residents in and around Orangeville also commute to other areas of the [[Greater Toronto Area]] for work.\n\nThere are a number of manufacturing plants located in the town. Major industrial employers include Greening Donald (automotive airbag components), Resolve Corporation (computer outsourcing), [[Clorox]] Company of Canada ([[Glad (company)|Glad]] garbage bags), Relizon Canada (pressure-sensitive labels), Rochling Engineering Plastics (formerly Symplastics Limited) (plastic sheets) and Sanoh Canada (automotive components). Orangeville is also the main banking center for residents in the area.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[Image:Orangeville town hall nov 5 2006.jpg|thumb|right|Orangeville Town Hall.]]\nThe main intersection in the heart of the town is Broadway (formerly [[Ontario Highway 9]]) and First Street. [[Ontario Highway 10|Highway 10]] runs through Orangeville on its east side.\n\nBeginning in 2005, a major roadwork project was initiated to resurface Broadway through Orangeville. The downtown section was completed in early 2006, with extensive work still to be done on the west end in late 2006. In conjunction with this project, there was another one completed in late 2006 that involved building large planters in the middle of Broadway through the downtown section between First and Third Streets (West - East). The project was controversial, as safety concerns had been raised by the Fire Department because the new concrete planters in the middle of the road have made the rights of way too narrow for fire trucks to properly set up in case of a fire in a downtown building.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nConstruction of the South Arterial Road, often referred to as the 'Orangeville by-pass', was completed on August 3, 2005.<ref>{{cite web |title=Certificates and Notices Under the Construction Lien Act |url=http://dcnonl.com/csp/63985 |website=Daily Commercial News and Construction Record |publisher=Reed Business Information a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. |accessdate=18 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728133034/http://dcnonl.com/csp/63985 |archivedate=28 July 2011 |date=September 2, 2005}}</ref> The road runs from east to west, connecting [[Ontario Highway 10|Highway 10]] and County Road 109 (formerly [[Ontario Highway 9|Highway 9]]). Much of the eastern stretch runs through the Town of [[Caledon, Ontario|Caledon]], but officially enters into Orangeville at the Townline Road controlled intersection.\n\n[[Aecon]] Construction and Materials Limited was the successful bidder for the Design Build project with a price of $9.8 million. The project was completed in conjunction with Brampton-based Armbro Construction, TSH Engineers Architects Planners, Peto MacCallum Ltd. and Gartner Lee Ltd.\n\n[[Orangeville Transit]] is the town's own public transit system, and there is a commuter [[GO Transit]] bus service to [[Brampton]]. In the early 1990s, preliminary plans were drawn up for GO Transit rail service to Orangeville. However, it never got past the drawing board.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nIndustries in Orangeville are served by the [[Orangeville Brampton Railway]], which purchased {{convert|55|km|abbr=out}} of surplus track from the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]. The railway connects with the CPR in Streetsville, and also services customers in Brampton to the south. From 2004 to 2018, a tourist train was operated on weekends in summer months.\n\nIn 1906, survey work was underway for an electric railway line which would serve Orangeville, to be called the Huron and Ontario Electric Railway.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dipping Into the Past - Survey under way for electric railway across Dufferin |url=http://www.citizen.on.ca/news/2006/1123/Columns/045.html |publisher=Orangeville Citizen |accessdate=18 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203233059/http://www.citizen.on.ca/news/2006/1123/Columns/045.html |archivedate=3 February 2009 |date=November 23, 2006}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Historical populations\n|type        = Canada\n|align       = right\n|width       =\n|state       =\n|shading     =\n|percentages =\n|footnote    =\n|1871|1458\n|1881|2847\n|1891|2962\n|1901|2511\n|[[Canada 1911 Census|1911]]|2340\n|1921|2187\n|1931|2614\n|1941|2718\n|1951|3249\n|1961|4593\n|1971|8074\n|1981|13740\n|1991|17921\n|[[Canada 1996 Census|1996]]|21498\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]|25248\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]|26925\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]|27975\n| [[Canada 2016 Census|2016]] | 28900\n}}\n\nAccording to the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 Canadian Census]],<ref name=cp2016/> the population of Orangeville is 28,900, a 3.3% increase from 2011, with a {{PAGR|2011|27975|2016|28900}} per annum average growth rate over the same period.

Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiassed opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the law and the constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he brutally betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion.</blockquote>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Democratization}}\nThe [[Roman Republic]] was the first known government in the western world to have a representative government, despite taking the form of a direct government in the [[Roman assemblies]].

The rising commercial class that had supported the Tudor monarchy in the 16th century led the revolutionary battle in the 17th, and succeeded in establishing the supremacy of Parliament and, eventually, of the House of Commons. What emerged as the distinctive feature of modern constitutionalism was not the insistence on the idea that the king is subject to law (although this concept is an essential attribute of all constitutionalism). This notion was already well established in the Middle Ages. What was distinctive was the establishment of effective means of political control whereby the rule of law might be enforced. Modern constitutionalism was born with the political requirement that representative government depended upon the consent of citizen subjects.... However, as can be seen through provisions in the 1689 Bill of Rights, the English Revolution was fought not just to protect the rights of property (in the narrow sense) but to establish those liberties which liberals believed essential to human dignity and moral worth. The \"rights of man\" enumerated in the English Bill of Rights gradually were proclaimed beyond the boundaries of England, notably in the American Declaration of Independence of 1776 and in the French Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024130317/http://www.ait.org.tw/infousa/zhtw/DOCS/Demopaper/dmpaper2.html|archivedate=24 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe [[American Revolution]] led to the creation of a new [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] of the United States in 1787, with a national legislature based partly on direct elections of representatives every two years, and thus responsible to the electorate for continuance in office.

These local communities are independent, which includes financial independence, and they are free to determine their own rules.\n* Local communities join together into a higher unit e.g. a canton.\n* There is no hierarchical bureaucracy.\n* There is competition between these local communities e.g. on services delivered or on taxes.\n\nA drawback to this type of government is that elected officials are not required to fulfill promises made before their election and are able to promote their own self-interests once elected, providing an incohesive system of governance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=S\u00f8rensen|first=Eva|year=2015|title=Enhancing policy innovation by redesigning representative democracy|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=6a6a6d4b-e1f4-45ab-a1c8-096f37485a35%40sessionmgr120&vid=1&hid=127|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=|pages=|via=ebscohost}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Legislators are also under scrutiny as the system of majority-won legislators voting for issues for the large group of people fosters inequality among the marginalized.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thaa|first=Winfried|year=2016|title=Issues and images \u2013 new sources of inequality in current representative democracy.|url=|journal=Critical Review of International Social & Political Philosophy|volume=19|issue=3|pages=357\u2013375|doi=10.1080/13698230.2016.1144859}}</ref>\n\n===Proposed solutions===\nThe system of [[stochocracy]] has been proposed as an improved system compared to the system of representative democracy, where representatives are elected.

Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiassed opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the law and the constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he brutally betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion.</blockquote>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Democratization}}\nThe [[Roman Republic]] was the first known government in the western world to have a representative government, despite taking the form of a direct government in the [[Roman assemblies]].

The rising commercial class that had supported the Tudor monarchy in the 16th century led the revolutionary battle in the 17th, and succeeded in establishing the supremacy of Parliament and, eventually, of the House of Commons. What emerged as the distinctive feature of modern constitutionalism was not the insistence on the idea that the king is subject to law (although this concept is an essential attribute of all constitutionalism). This notion was already well established in the Middle Ages. What was distinctive was the establishment of effective means of political control whereby the rule of law might be enforced. Modern constitutionalism was born with the political requirement that representative government depended upon the consent of citizen subjects.... However, as can be seen through provisions in the 1689 Bill of Rights, the English Revolution was fought not just to protect the rights of property (in the narrow sense) but to establish those liberties which liberals believed essential to human dignity and moral worth. The \"rights of man\" enumerated in the English Bill of Rights gradually were proclaimed beyond the boundaries of England, notably in the American Declaration of Independence of 1776 and in the French Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024130317/http://www.ait.org.tw/infousa/zhtw/DOCS/Demopaper/dmpaper2.html|archivedate=24 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe [[American Revolution]] led to the creation of a new [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] of the United States in 1787, with a national legislature based partly on direct elections of representatives every two years, and thus responsible to the electorate for continuance in office.
