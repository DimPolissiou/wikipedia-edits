{"title_page": "Psychological horror", "text_new": "'''Psychological horror''' is a [[genre|subgenre]] of [[horror fiction|horror]] and [[psychological fiction]] that relies on mental, emotional and psychological [[Mental state|states]] to frighten, disturb, or unsettle its audience. The subgenre frequently overlaps with the related subgenre of [[psychological thriller]], and it often uses [[mystery fiction|mystery]] elements and characters with unstable, unreliable, or disturbed psychological states to enhance the [[suspense]], [[drama]], [[action (narrative)|action]], and [[paranoia]] of the setting and plot and to provide an overall unpleasant, unsettling, or distressing [[Mood (literature)|atmosphere]].\n\n==Characteristics==\nPsychological horror usually aims to create discomfort or dread by exposing common or universal psychological and emotional vulnerabilities/fears and revealing the darker parts of the human psyche that most people may repress or deny. This idea is referred to in [[analytical psychology]] as the [[Jungian archetypes|archetypal]] [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] characteristics: [[suspicion (emotion)|suspicion]], [[distrust]], [[Doubt|self-doubt]], and [[paranoia]] of others, themselves, and the world.\n\nThe genre sometimes seeks to challenge or confuse the audience's grasp of the narrative or plot by focusing on characters who are themselves unsure of or doubting their own perceptions of reality or questioning their own [[sanity]]. Characters' [[perception]]s of their surroundings or situations may indeed be distorted or subject to [[delusion]]s, outside manipulation or [[gaslighting]] by other characters, [[Mental disorder|emotional disturbances]], and even [[hallucination]]s or [[mental disorder]]s. In many cases, and in a similar way as the overlapping genre of [[psychological thriller]], psychological horror may deploy an [[unreliable narrator]] or imply that aspects of the story are being perceived inaccurately by a protagonist, thus confusing or unsettling viewers or readers and setting up an ominous or disturbing overarching tone. In other cases, the narrator or protagonist may be reliable or ostensibly mentally stable but is placed in a situation involving another character or characters who are psychologically, mentally, or emotionally disturbed. Thus, elements of psychological horror focus on mental conflicts. These become important as the characters face perverse situations, sometimes involving the [[supernatural]], [[immorality]], [[murder]], and [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracies]]. While other horror media emphasize fantastical situations such as attacks by [[monster]]s, psychological horror tends to keep the monsters hidden and to involve situations more grounded in [[Realism (arts)|artistic realism]].\n\n[[Plot twist]]s are an often-used device. Characters commonly face internal battles with subconscious desires such as romantic lust and the desire for petty revenge. In contrast, [[splatter film|splatter fiction]] focuses on bizarre, alien evil to which the average viewer cannot easily relate. However, at times, the psychological horror and splatter subgenres overlap, such as in the French horror film ''[[High Tension]]''.<ref name=\"JOAP\">{{cite journal |title=Psychoanalytic theory in times of terror |journal=Journal of Analytical Psychology |issue=48 |volume=4 |page=407 |date=September 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Novels==\nThe novel ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (novel)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' written by [[Thomas Harris]], Robert Bloch novels such as ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]'' and ''[[American Gothic (novel)|American Gothic]]'', [[Stephen King]] novels such as ''[[Carrie (novel)|Carrie]]'', ''[[Misery (novel)|Misery]]'', ''[[The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon]]'', ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]'', and [[Koji Suzuki (writer)|Koji Suzuki]]'s novel ''[[Ring (Suzuki novel)|Ring]]'' are some examples of psychological horror. [[Shirley Jackson]]'s ''[[We Have Always Lived in the Castle]]'' is often viewed as one of the best examples of psychological horror in fiction.\n\n==Films==\nPsychological horror films generally differ from the [[horror film|traditional horror film]], where the source of the fear is typically something material, such as grotesque or horrifying [[Creature (2011 film)|creatures]], [[monster]]s, [[serial killer]]s, or [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]],{{sfn|Hayward|2006|p=148}} as well as the [[splatter film]], which derives its frightening effects from gore and [[graphic violence]],{{sfn|Hayward|2006|p=148}} in that tension in psychological horror films is more frequently built through atmosphere, eerie sounds and exploitation of the viewer's and the character's psychological fears. Psychological horror films sometimes frighten or unsettle by relying on the viewer's or character's own imagination or the anticipation of a threat rather than an actual threat or a material source of fear portrayed onscreen. However, some psychological horror films may in fact contain a material or overt threat or a physical source of fear, as well as scenes of graphic gore or violence, yet still rely or focus mainly on atmosphere and the psychological, mental, and emotional states of the characters and viewers to frighten or disturb. For instance, some psychological horror films may portray psychotic murderers and scenes of graphic violence while still maintaining an atmosphere that focuses on either the villain's, protagonist's, or audience's psychological, mental, or emotional status.\n\n''[[The Black Cat (1934 film)|The Black Cat]]'' (1934) and ''[[Cat People (1942 film)|Cat People]]'' (1942) have been cited as early psychological horror films.<ref>{{cite book |last=Skal |first=David J. |title=The Monster Show: A Cultural History of Horror |date=15 October 2001 |publisher=Macmillan |page=180 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xwlNnOxMt1gC&pg=PA180&lpg=PA180&dq=%22psychological+horror%22+film&source=bl&ots=YY4_ekXHDw&sig=rEK2aBBkpLYVz_6M0XIN7X277TY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gNpoUOLiBKyZiAezhYHgDw&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAjgo#v=onepage&q=%22psychological%20horror%22%20film&f=false |accessdate=1 October 2012 |isbn=0571199968}}</ref>{{sfn|Hayward|2006|p=148}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Strinati |first=Dominic |title=An Introduction to Studying Popular Culture |date=31 August 2000 |publisher=Routledge |page=90 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T4HqSHbXtMUC&pg=PA90&lpg=PA90&dq=%22psychological+horror%22+film&source=bl&ots=1GD-gRNshc&sig=2IdTy3HpoIG92pg0O6C_b1lyfzg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QddoUNzQKYmfiQes9oDoDw&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22psychological%20horror%22%20film&f=false |accessdate=1 October 2012 |isbn=0415157668}}</ref>\n\n[[Roman Polanski]] directed two films which are considered quintessential psychological horror: ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]'' (1965) and ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1968).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Browne |first1=Ray B. |last2=Browne |first2=Pat |title=The Guide to United States Popular Culture |date=15 June 2001 |publisher=Popular Press |page=411 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U3rJxPYT32MC&pg=PA411&lpg=PA411&dq=%22psychological+horror%22+film&source=bl&ots=opbm88BELR&sig=6_4Zs5Y41PGNy1Wld3nKIiBgoy8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gNpoUOLiBKyZiAezhYHgDw&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBTgo#v=onepage&q=%22psychological%20horror%22%20film&f=false |accessdate=1 October 2012 |isbn=0879728213}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Mazierska |first=Ewa |title=Roman Polanski: The Cinema of a Cultural Traveller |date=15 June 2007 |publisher=I.B.Taurus |page=89 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LH9mYBGgKb8C&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&dq=%22psychological+horror%22+film&source=bl&ots=mlvkYuf2BD&sig=9bJ3fmNBFM1uvEcNZhre_93MiUQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rNpoUIb4DIWRigfC84DYDw&ved=0CE4Q6AEwBTgy#v=onepage&q=%22psychological%20horror%22%20film&f=false |accessdate=1 October 2012 |isbn=1845112970}}</ref> [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s 1980 film ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', adapted from the aforementioned Stephen King novel, is another particularly well-known example of the genre.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kawin |first=Bruce F. |title=Horror and the Horror Film |date=25 June 2012 |publisher=Anthem Press |page=115 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r88NdErN1pkC&pg=PA115&lpg=PA115&dq=%22psychological+horror%22+film&source=bl&ots=cIqp8sPul_&sig=aLbJmDM7U8la_GMbE-2nTv9okPo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rNpoUIb4DIWRigfC84DYDw&ved=0CFQQ6AEwBjgy#v=onepage&q=%22psychological%20horror%22%20film&f=false |accessdate=1 October 2012 |isbn=0857284495}}</ref> ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991) directed by [[Jonathan Demme]] is another example of psychological horror, whilst also incorporating elements of the [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] genre.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS And Horror Aversion At The Oscars|url=http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2015/01/16/the-silence-of-the-lambs-and-horror-aversion-at-the-oscars|website=birthmoviesdeath.com|publisher=Britt Hayes|accessdate=2 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Top 10 Psychological Horror Movies - Alternative Reel|url=http://www.alternativereel.com/cult_movies/display_article.php?id=0000000011|website=Alternative Reel|publisher=Alternative Reel|accessdate=25 December 2015}}</ref> Recent English-language films in the genre include [[Darren Aronofsky|Darren Aronofsky's]] ''[[Black Swan (film)|Black Swan]]'' (2010), ''[[The Babadook]]'' (2014), ''[[It Follows]]'' (2015), ''[[Get Out]]'' (2017), ''[[Hereditary (film)|Hereditary]]'' (2018), and ''[[The Lighthouse (2019 film)|The Lighthouse]]'' (2019).\n\nThe [[Cinema of Italy|Italian film]] genre known as ''[[giallo]]'' often employs psychological horror or elements of the psychological horror subgenre.

The subgenre frequently overlaps with the related subgenre of [[psychological thriller]], and it often uses [[mystery fiction|mystery]] elements and characters with unstable, unreliable, or disturbed psychological states to enhance the [[suspense]], [[drama]], [[action (narrative)|action]], and [[paranoia]] of the setting and plot and to provide an overall unpleasant, unsettling, or distressing [[Mood (literature)|atmosphere]].\n\n==Characteristics==\nPsychological horror usually aims to create discomfort or dread by exposing common or universal psychological and emotional vulnerabilities/fears and revealing the darker parts of the human psyche that most people may repress or deny. This idea is referred to in [[analytical psychology]] as the [[Jungian archetypes|archetypal]] [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] characteristics: [[suspicion (emotion)|suspicion]], [[distrust]], [[Doubt|self-doubt]], and [[paranoia]] of others, themselves, and the world.\n\nThe genre sometimes seeks to challenge or confuse the audience's grasp of the narrative or plot by focusing on characters who are themselves unsure of or doubting their own perceptions of reality or questioning their own [[sanity]]. Characters' [[perception]]s of their surroundings or situations may indeed be distorted or subject to [[delusion]]s, outside manipulation or [[gaslighting]] by other characters, [[Mental disorder|emotional disturbances]], and even [[hallucination]]s or [[mental disorder]]s. In many cases, and in a similar way as the overlapping genre of [[psychological thriller]], psychological horror may deploy an [[unreliable narrator]] or imply that aspects of the story are being perceived inaccurately by a protagonist, thus confusing or unsettling viewers or readers and setting up an ominous or disturbing overarching tone. In other cases, the narrator or protagonist may be reliable or ostensibly mentally stable but is placed in a situation involving another character or characters who are psychologically, mentally, or emotionally disturbed. Thus, elements of psychological horror focus on mental conflicts. These become important as the characters face perverse situations, sometimes involving the [[supernatural]], [[immorality]], [[murder]], and [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracies]]. While other horror media emphasize fantastical situations such as attacks by [[monster]]s, psychological horror tends to keep the monsters hidden and to involve situations more grounded in [[Realism (arts)|artistic realism]].\n\n[[Plot twist]]s are an often-used device. Characters commonly face internal battles with subconscious desires such as romantic lust and the desire for petty revenge. In contrast, [[splatter film|splatter fiction]] focuses on bizarre, alien evil to which the average viewer cannot easily relate. However, at times, the psychological horror and splatter subgenres overlap, such as in the French horror film ''[[High Tension]]''.<ref name=\"JOAP\">{{cite journal |title=Psychoanalytic theory in times of terror |journal=Journal of Analytical Psychology |issue=48 |volume=4 |page=407 |date=September 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Novels==\nThe novel ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (novel)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' written by [[Thomas Harris]], Robert Bloch novels such as ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]'' and ''[[American Gothic (novel)|American Gothic]]'', [[Stephen King]] novels such as ''[[Carrie (novel)|Carrie]]'', ''[[Misery (novel)|Misery]]'', ''[[The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon]]'', ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]'', and [[Koji Suzuki (writer)|Koji Suzuki]]'s novel ''[[Ring (Suzuki novel)|Ring]]'' are some examples of psychological horror. [[Shirley Jackson]]'s ''[[We Have Always Lived in the Castle]]'' is often viewed as one of the best examples of psychological horror in fiction.\n\n==Films==\nPsychological horror films generally differ from the [[horror film|traditional horror film]], where the source of the fear is typically something material, such as grotesque or horrifying [[Creature (2011 film)|creatures]], [[monster]]s, [[serial killer]]s, or [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]],{{sfn|Hayward|2006|p=148}} as well as the [[splatter film]], which derives its frightening effects from gore and [[graphic violence]],{{sfn|Hayward|2006|p=148}} in that tension in psychological horror films is more frequently built through atmosphere, eerie sounds and exploitation of the viewer's and the character's psychological fears. Psychological horror films sometimes frighten or unsettle by relying on the viewer's or character's own imagination or the anticipation of a threat rather than an actual threat or a material source of fear portrayed onscreen. However, some psychological horror films may in fact contain a material or overt threat or a physical source of fear, as well as scenes of graphic gore or violence, yet still rely or focus mainly on atmosphere and the psychological, mental, and emotional states of the characters and viewers to frighten or disturb. For instance, some psychological horror films may portray psychotic murderers and scenes of graphic violence while still maintaining an atmosphere that focuses on either the villain's, protagonist's, or audience's psychological, mental, or emotional status.\n\n''[[The Black Cat (1934 film)|The Black Cat]]'' (1934) and ''[[Cat People (1942 film)|Cat People]]'' (1942) have been cited as early psychological horror films.<ref>{{cite book |last=Skal |first=David J. |title=The Monster Show: A Cultural History of Horror |date=15 October 2001 |publisher=Macmillan |page=180 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xwlNnOxMt1gC&pg=PA180&lpg=PA180&dq=%22psychological+horror%22+film&source=bl&ots=YY4_ekXHDw&sig=rEK2aBBkpLYVz_6M0XIN7X277TY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gNpoUOLiBKyZiAezhYHgDw&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAjgo#v=onepage&q=%22psychological%20horror%22%20film&f=false |accessdate=1 October 2012 |isbn=0571199968}}</ref>{{sfn|Hayward|2006|p=148}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Strinati |first=Dominic |title=An Introduction to Studying Popular Culture |date=31 August 2000 |publisher=Routledge |page=90 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T4HqSHbXtMUC&pg=PA90&lpg=PA90&dq=%22psychological+horror%22+film&source=bl&ots=1GD-gRNshc&sig=2IdTy3HpoIG92pg0O6C_b1lyfzg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QddoUNzQKYmfiQes9oDoDw&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22psychological%20horror%22%20film&f=false |accessdate=1 October 2012 |isbn=0415157668}}</ref>\n\n[[Roman Polanski]] directed two films which are considered quintessential psychological horror: ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]'' (1965) and ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1968).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Browne |first1=Ray B. |last2=Browne |first2=Pat |title=The Guide to United States Popular Culture |date=15 June 2001 |publisher=Popular Press |page=411 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U3rJxPYT32MC&pg=PA411&lpg=PA411&dq=%22psychological+horror%22+film&source=bl&ots=opbm88BELR&sig=6_4Zs5Y41PGNy1Wld3nKIiBgoy8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gNpoUOLiBKyZiAezhYHgDw&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBTgo#v=onepage&q=%22psychological%20horror%22%20film&f=false |accessdate=1 October 2012 |isbn=0879728213}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Mazierska |first=Ewa |title=Roman Polanski: The Cinema of a Cultural Traveller |date=15 June 2007 |publisher=I.B.Taurus |page=89 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LH9mYBGgKb8C&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&dq=%22psychological+horror%22+film&source=bl&ots=mlvkYuf2BD&sig=9bJ3fmNBFM1uvEcNZhre_93MiUQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rNpoUIb4DIWRigfC84DYDw&ved=0CE4Q6AEwBTgy#v=onepage&q=%22psychological%20horror%22%20film&f=false |accessdate=1 October 2012 |isbn=1845112970}}</ref> [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s 1980 film ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'', adapted from the aforementioned Stephen King novel, is another particularly well-known example of the genre.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kawin |first=Bruce F. |title=Horror and the Horror Film |date=25 June 2012 |publisher=Anthem Press |page=115 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r88NdErN1pkC&pg=PA115&lpg=PA115&dq=%22psychological+horror%22+film&source=bl&ots=cIqp8sPul_&sig=aLbJmDM7U8la_GMbE-2nTv9okPo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rNpoUIb4DIWRigfC84DYDw&ved=0CFQQ6AEwBjgy#v=onepage&q=%22psychological%20horror%22%20film&f=false |accessdate=1 October 2012 |isbn=0857284495}}</ref> ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991) directed by [[Jonathan Demme]] is another example of psychological horror, whilst also incorporating elements of the [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] genre.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS And Horror Aversion At The Oscars|url=http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2015/01/16/the-silence-of-the-lambs-and-horror-aversion-at-the-oscars|website=birthmoviesdeath.com|publisher=Britt Hayes|accessdate=2 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Top 10 Psychological Horror Movies - Alternative Reel|url=http://www.alternativereel.com/cult_movies/display_article.php?id=0000000011|website=Alternative Reel|publisher=Alternative Reel|accessdate=25 December 2015}}</ref> Recent English-language films in the genre include [[Darren Aronofsky|Darren Aronofsky's]] ''[[Black Swan (film)|Black Swan]]'' (2010), ''[[The Babadook]]'' (2014), ''[[It Follows]]'' (2015), ''[[Get Out]]'' (2017), ''[[Hereditary (film)|Hereditary]]'' (2018), and ''[[The Lighthouse (2019 film)|The Lighthouse]]'' (2019).\n\nThe [[Cinema of Italy|Italian film]] genre known as ''[[giallo]]'' often employs psychological horror or elements of the psychological horror subgenre.

Today, the overwhelming majority of Turkish Armenians [[Armenians in Istanbul|are concentrated in Istanbul]]. They support their own newspapers and schools, and the majority belong to the [[Armenian Apostolic]] faith.\n\nUntil the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915, most of the Armenian population of Turkey (then the [[Ottoman Empire]]) lived in the eastern parts of the country that Armenians call [[Western Armenia]] (roughly corresponding to the modern [[Eastern Anatolia Region]]).\n\n== History ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2008}}\n[[File:Turkey, Istanbul.jpg|thumb|Armenian women and children in [[Ottoman Constantinople|Constantinople]] (now [[Istanbul]]) in 1912]]\n{{Main|Armenians in the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Armenian population|Ottoman Armenian casualties}}\n\nArmenians living in Turkey today are a remnant of what was once a much larger community that existed for thousands of years, long before the establishment of the [[Sultanate of Rum]]. Estimates for the [[Ottoman Armenian population|number of Armenian citizens of the Ottoman Empire]] in the decade before World War I range between 1.3 (official Ottoman data) and 3 million (independent estimates).\n\nWhen [[Constantinople]] finally became part of the Ottoman Empire, financial support was given to the Apostolic Church by the Sultan, so it could build churches in the city, which prior to that the Byzantines refused as they viewed the church as heretical. Armenians in the Ottoman Empire were viewed as a separate [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]], and given the status of [[second-class citizen]]s, but were not usually mistreated until later in the empire's history. Many Armenians gained significant positions in the empire in professions such as banking, which they almost had a monopoly in. The oldest Turkish company, [[Zildjian]], was founded by an Armenian.\n\nStarting in the late 19th century, political instability, dire economic conditions, and continuing [[Hamidian Massacres|ethnic tensions]] prompted the emigration of as many as 100,000 Armenians to [[Europe]], the [[Americas]] and the [[Middle East]]. This massive exodus from the Ottoman Empire is what started the modern [[Armenian diaspora]] worldwide.\n\nThere was conflict between Armenians and Turks between 1892 and 1915.  The [[Armenian Genocide]]<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20100819160104/http://www.umd.umich.edu/dept/armenian/facts/ /gen_bib1.html Extensive bibliography by University of Michigan on the Armenian Genocide]</ref> followed in 1915\u20131916 until 1918, during \nwhich the Ottoman government of the time ordered the deportation and killing of more than 1 million Armenians. These measures affected an estimated 75\u201380% of all the Armenians living in the \nOttoman Empire during [[World War I]]. Many died directly through Ottoman massacres, while others died as a result of dehydration, disease, and starvation during the death marches and in the [[Syrian Desert]], and even more due to [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] raids on fleeing refugees during the death marches.\n\nAs for the remaining Armenians in the east, they found refuge by 1917\u20131918 in the [[Caucasus]] and within the areas controlled by the newly established [[Democratic Republic of Armenia]]. They never returned to their original homes in today's Eastern Turkey (composed of six [[vilayets]], [[Erzurum Vilayet|Erzurum]], [[Van Vilayet|Van]], [[Bitlis Vilayet|Bitlis]], [[Diyarbekir Vilayet|Diyarbak\u0131r]], [[Mamuret\u00fclaziz Vilayet|Mamuret\u00fclaziz]], and [[Sivas Vilayet|Sivas]]).\n\nTheir descendants are known as [[Hidden Armenians]] and are present throughout [[Western Armenia]], but particularly in Dersim ([[Tunceli]]). Through the 20th century, an unknown number of Armenians living in the mountainous region of Dersim converted to [[Alevism]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Armenian Elements in the Beliefs of the Kizilbash Kurds|url=http://rbedrosian.com/mmpaul1.htm|accessdate=28 April 2013|date=27 April 2013|newspaper=\u0130nternet Haber}}</ref> During the [[Armenian Genocide]], many of the Armenians in the region were saved by their [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] neighbors.<ref>{{cite book|last=A.

Armenians deported from areas that were under allied control by 1918, particularly the short lived [[French Mandate]], which had control of southeastern [[Turkey]] and all of [[Cilicia]] according to the [[Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement]], were able to return to their homes to gather things or search for loved ones. After the fall of French Cilicia, Some of those returnees attempted to stay permanently after the Turks gained the territory back, but were all driven away by the early 1930s due to various reasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://armenianweekly.com/2011/10/14/a-history-of-destruction/|title=A History of Destruction: The Fate of Armenian Church Properties in Adana [i]|author=Hairenik|work=Armenian Weekly}}</ref> Those who left the Mandate ended up in Syria, France, Armenia, the Americas and the rest of Europe, in that order. The Armenian population suffered a final blow with ongoing massacres and atrocities throughout the period 1920\u20131923, during the [[Turkish War of Independence]]. Those suffering the most were those Armenians remaining in the east and the south of Turkey, and the [[Pontic Greeks]] in the [[Black Sea Region]].\n\nBy the end of the 1920s, only a sprinkling of non-converted Armenians left in Turkey were scattered sparsely throughout the country, with the only viable Armenian population remaining in [[Istanbul]] and its environs, [[Diyarbakir]] and [[Malayta]], with those largely disappearing due to the [[Turkey-PKK War]] necessitating their migration to Istanbul. At the time of the establishment of the Republic of Turkey, [[Hatay Province]] was part of Syria, and is why that area still has some established and officially recognized Armenian communities.\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{See also|Demographics of Turkey|List of Turkish-Armenians}}\nDue to events in Turkey during the last century Turkish Armenians were killed, forced into hiding, and forcibly converted to Islam, which therefore split them into different groups. There are three groups- Armenian Christians, Crypto Armenians, and Muslim Armenians. Christian Armenians are in most cases part of the recognized minority, but can also include Crypto Armenians who are not legally recognized as Armenian but identify as both Armenian and Christian, and Armenian immigrants to Turkey. Crypto Armenians are Armenians who are legally identified as Turks and are either Christian and openly recognize their identity, hide their identity and either practice [[Crypto-Christianity]] or Islam, Openly identify as Armenian but are Muslim, or don't know about their ethnicity at all. The combined total of all Armenians in Turkey is unknown, because the number of people who are Crypto Armenian is hard to determine, with numbers ranging from as low as 30,000 to several million depending on how broad the standards were to be considered Crypto Armenian in the studies made. However, the combined total of immigrant Armenians and those in the recognized minority would be estimated at 150\u2013170,000. Another statistic could be the number of people who are members of the [[Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople]], being at 95,000.\n\n===Armenian Christians===\nThe officially recognized Armenian Christian population is estimated to be between 50,000 and 70,000, mostly living in [[Istanbul]] and its environs. They are almost always members of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]], [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian Catholic]] or [[Armenian Evangelical Church|Armenian Evangelical]] churches. The number of Armenian Christians is both diminishing due to emigration to [[Europe]], the [[Americas]] and [[Australia]], and increasing due to immigrants from Armenia looking for work (who are entirely Christian), and Crypto-Armenians who decide to identify openly as Armenians and convert to Christianity. However, most of that growth is not reflected in official data, because Crypto-Armenians are not listed as part of the recognized Armenian minority due to Turkish laws on the officially recognized (Armenians, Greeks, and Jews) minorities, which doesn't allow newly identified Armenians to change their Turkish identities they were given at birth. As for Armenian immigrants, most are unable to join the minority because they are illegal immigrants. Due to those factors, the [[de jure]] number of Armenian Christians is much lower than the [[de facto]] amount.\n\nThe Armenian minority is recognized as a separate [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|\"millet\"]] in the Turkish system and has its own religious, cultural, social and educational institutions along with a distinct media. The Turkish Armenian community struggles to keep its own institutions, media and schools open due to diminishing demand from emigration and quite considerable economic sacrifices.\n\n====Regions with Armenian Christians====\n\n=====[[Istanbul Province|Istanbul]]=====\n{{main|Armenians in Istanbul}}\nThe Armenian Community of [[Istanbul]] is the largest in Turkey, a catalyst being due to the fact that it was the only place that Armenian Christians were at least somewhat protected at the time of the creation of Turkey post Armenian Genocide. Other factors included the Patriarchate having its headquarters in the city, and the city's economy and quality of life attracting Armenian immigrants which allowed for the community to keep stable numbers in the face of [[Istanbul Pogrom|discrimination]] and constant migration, unlike the Greek community, which by comparison had far less or no immigration and now has only 2000\u20133000, mostly elderly members, regardless of the fact it had far more members than the Armenian community starting in 1924 (the first post genocide census).\n\nThe three most important Armenian districts in Istanbul are the [[Kumkap\u0131]], [[Ye\u015filk\u00f6y]], and [[Pangalti]] districts, as well as the [[Prince Islands]]. Kumkapi is the location of the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople, and is known for its many fish restaurants and historic Churches. One of the main differences between the districts is that Kumkapi is [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Apostolic]], While Pangalti has a mix of [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian]] and [[Roman Catholic]], and Yesilk\u00f6y is mostly Armenian Catholic, Roman Catholic and Syriac Orthodox. Kumkapi is also located in the [[Fatih|Old city]], while Pangalti is in the [[\u015ei\u015fli|newer part]], and Yesilk\u00f6y is a District within Greater Istanbul next to the outer walls of the Fatih District.\n\n=====[[Hatay Province]]=====\n[[Iskenderun]] has one small Armenian church, and a community of a few dozen Armenians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anadolukatolikkilisesi.org/iskenderun/en/cristiani.asp|title=Iskenderun: Catholic Church - Katolik Kilisesi - Chiesa Cattolica - Katholischer Church|work=anadolukatolikkilisesi.org|access-date=2015-07-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305192407/http://www.anadolukatolikkilisesi.org/iskenderun/en/cristiani.asp|archive-date=2016-03-05|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[Vak\u0131fl\u0131, Samanda\u011f|Vak\u0131fl\u0131 K\u00f6y\u00fc]] ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: {{lang|hy|\u054e\u0561\u0584\u056b\u0586}} \u2014 '''Vakif''') is the only remaining fully ethnic Armenian village in [[Turkey]].

The reason for this is historical; according to Armenians, Christians once celebrated Christmas on 6 January, until the 4th century. 25 December was originally a [[pagan]] holiday that celebrated the birth of the sun. Many members of the church continued to celebrate both holidays, and the Roman church changed the date of Christmas to be 25 December and declared January 6 to be the date when the [[three wise men]] visited the baby Jesus. As the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] had already separated from the Roman church at that time, the date of Christmas remained unchanged for Armenians.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lraper.org/main.aspx?Action=DisplayNews&NewsCode=N000001752&Lang=ENG | title=Why Do Armenians Celebrate Christmas on 6 January? | publisher=Armenian Patriarchate of Istanbul | accessdate=2007-01-04 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926222541/http://www.lraper.org/main.aspx?Action=DisplayNews&NewsCode=N000001752&Lang=ENG | archive-date=2007-09-26 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe Armenians in Turkey refer to Christmas as ''Surp Dz\u0131nunt'' (Holy Birth) and have fifty days of preparation called ''Hisnag'' before Christmas.

Partly because of this, [[Istanbul]] veritably became the cultural and literary center of the Western Armenians in the 19th and early 20th century.\n\nWestern Armenian is the language spoken by almost all of the [[Armenian diaspora]]. The only diaspora community that uses [[Eastern Armenian]] is the [[Iranian Armenian]] community, or those who immigrated from Armenia. Nevertheless, Western Armenian is the primary dialect of Armenian found in [[North America|North]] and [[South America]], [[Europe]] (except [[Russian Armenians|those in Russia]]) and most of the [[Middle East]] (except in [[Iran]] and [[Armenia]]). Western Armenian is the primary language of the diaspora because the great majority of the [[Armenian diaspora]] in all these areas (Europe, Americas, Middle East) was formed in the 19th and early 20th century by Armenian populations from the Ottoman Empire, which is where Western Armenian was historically spoken.\n\nNevertheless, The Western Armenian language is still spoken by a small minority of the present-day Armenian community in Turkey. However, Only 18 percent of the Armenian community speaks Western Armenian, while 82 percent of the Armenian community speaks Turkish. This percentage is even lower among younger people of whom only 8 percent speaks Western Armenian and 92 percent speaks Turkish.<ref name=\"community\" /> \nTurkish is replacing Western Armenian as a [[mother language]], and [[UNESCO]] has added Western Armenian in its annual \"Atlas of the World\u2019s Languages in Danger\"  where the Western Armenian language in Turkey is defined as a '''[[endangered language|definitely endangered language]]'''.<ref name=\"unesco.org\">[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00206 UNESCO Culture Sector, UNESCO Interactive Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger, 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222090430/http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00206 |date=February 22, 2009 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.bianet.org/english/kategori/english/112728/unesco-15-languages-endangered-in-turkey UNESCO: 15 Languages Endangered in Turkey, by T.

Western Armenian still keeps the [[classical Armenian orthography]] known as Mashdotsian Spelling, whereas Eastern Armenian adopted [[Spelling reform of the Armenian language 1922\u20131924|reformed spelling]] in the 1920s (Eastern Armenian in Iran did not adopt this reform then).\n\n===Armeno-Turkish (Turkish in Armenian alphabet)===\nFrom the early 18th century until around 1950, and for almost 250 years, more than 2000 books were printed in the [[Turkish language]] using letters of the [[Armenian alphabet]]. This is popularly known as Armeno-Turkish.\n\nArmeno-Turkish was not used just by Armenians, but also many non-Armenian elite (including the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Turkish intellectuals) could actually read the Armenian-alphabet Turkish language texts.\n\nThe Armenian alphabet was also used alongside the Arabic alphabet on official documents of the Ottoman Empire, written in [[Ottoman language|Ottoman Turkish]]. For example, the [[Aleppo]] edition of the official gazette of the Ottoman Empire, called \"Frat\" (Turkish and Arabic for the Euphrates) contained a Turkish section of laws printed in Armenian alphabet.\n\nAlso very notably, the first [[novel]] to be written in the Ottoman Empire was 1851's ''[[Akabi Hikayesi]]'', written by Armenian statesman, journalist and novelist [[Vartan Pasha]] (Hovsep Vartanian) in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], was published with [[Armenian script]]. ''Akabi Hikayesi'' depicted an impossible love story between two young people coming from two different communities amidst hostility and adversity.\n\nWhen the Armenian [[Duzian family]] managed the Ottoman mint during the reign of [[Abd\u00fclmecid I]], they kept their records in Ottoman Turkish written in Armenian script.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mansel|first=Philip|title=Constantinople|year=2011|publisher=Hachette UK|isbn=978-1848546479|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LrnvC98bNSoC}}</ref>\n\nGreat collection of Armeno-Turkish could be found in Christian Armenian worship until the late 1950s. The [[Bible]] used by many Armenians in the Ottoman Empire was not only the Bible versions printed in Armenian, but also at times the translated [[Turkish language]] Bibles using the [[Armenian alphabet]]. Usage continued in Armenian church gatherings specially for those who were Turkophones rather than Armenophones. Many of the Christian spiritual songs used in certain Armenian churches were also in Armeno-Turkish.\n\n===Armenians and the Turkish language===\n[[File:Istanbul - Armenian school - P1040046.JPG|thumb|The Armenian school in Kumkapi, Istanbul (next to the Surp Asdvadzadzin Patriarchal Church)]]\nArmenians played a key role in the promotion of the [[Turkish language]] including the reforms of the [[Turkish language]] initiated by [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]].\n\n[[Bedros Keresteciyan]], the Ottoman [[linguist]] completed the first [[etymological dictionary]] of Turkish. Armenians contributed considerably to the development of printing in Turkey: [[Tokatl\u0131 Apkar T\u0131bir]] started a printing house in Istanbul in 1567, the historian [[Eremia \u00c7elebi]], [[Merzifonlu Krikor]], [[Sivasl\u0131 Parseh]], [[Hagop Brothers]], [[Ha\u00e7ik Kevorkyan]] Abraham from Thrace, E\u011finli [[Bogos Arabian]], [[Hovannes Muhendisian]], [[Rephael Kazancian]] were among many. [[Bogos Arabian]] issued the first Turkish daily newspaper, ''[[Takvim-i Vekayi]]'' and its translation to Armenian. [[Hovannes Muhendisian]] is known as the \"Turkish Gutenberg\". [[Ha\u00e7ik Kevorkyan]] updated the [[Ottoman Turkish alphabet]]. [[Yervant M\u0131s\u0131rl\u0131yan]] developed and implemented publishing books in installments for the first time in the Ottoman Empire. [[Kasap Efendi]], published the first Comic magazine ''[[Diyojen]]'' in 1870. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n[[Agop Dil\u00e2\u00e7ar]] (1895\u20131979) was a Turkish Armenian [[linguistics|linguist]] who had great contribution to the reform of [[Turkish language]]. He specialized in [[Turkic languages]] and was the first Secretary General and head specialist of the [[Turkish Language Association]] (TLA) from its establishment in 1932 until 1979. In addition to [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]], Martayan knew [[English language|English]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Latin]], [[German language|German]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]. He was invited on September 22, 1932, as a linguistics specialist to the ''[[First Turkish Language Congress]]'' supervised by [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]]. [[Istepan Gurdikyan]] (1865\u20131948), [[linguist]], [[Turcology|Turcologist]], educator and academic and [[Kevork \u015eimke\u015fyan]] both ethnic Armenians were also prominent speakers at the first Turkish Language Conference. [[Agop Martayan Dila\u00e7ar]] continued his work and research on the [[Turkish language]] as the head specialist and Secretary General of the newly founded Turkish Language Association in [[Ankara]]. Atat\u00fcrk suggested him the surname ''Dila\u00e7ar'' (literally meaning ''language opener''), which he accepted. He taught history and language at [[Ankara University]] between 1936 and 1951 and was the head advisor of the ''T\u00fcrk Ansiklopedisi'' (''Turkish Encyclopedia''), between 1942 and 1960. He held his position and continued his research in linguistics at the Turkish Language Association until his death in 1979.\n\n==Culture==\nArmenians try to keep a rich cultural life and do participate in the Turkish art scene.\n\n===Music===\nThe pan-Turkish [[Karde\u015f T\u00fcrk\u00fcler]] cultural and musical formation, in addition to performing a rich selection of Turkish, Kurdish, Georgian, Arabic and gypsy musical numbers, also includes a number of beautiful interpretation of Armenian traditional music in its repertoire. It gave sold-out concerts in [[Armenia]] as part of the Turkish-Armenian Cultural Program, which was made possible with support from [[USAID]].\n\nThe \"Sayat-Nova\" choir was founded in 1971 under the sponsorship of the St. Children\u2019s Church of Istanbul performs traditional Armenian songs and studies and interprets Armenian folk music.\n\nIn classical opera music and theatre, Toto Karaca was a major figure on the stage. In the folk tradition, the effect of [[Udi Hrant Kenkulian]] as a legendary [[oud]] player is indisputable.\n\nIn contemporary music, [[Arto Tun\u00e7boyac\u0131yan]] and his brother the late [[Onno Tun\u00e7]] are two veritable jazz musicians, composers and arrangers. The Turkish rock artist [[Ya\u015far Kurt]] declared he was of ethnic Armenian descent. Another famous Armenian rock musician is [[Hayko Cepkin]]. Hayko Tataryan is also well known for singing in Turkish, Armenian and Greek, so is his son Alex Tataryan. Very recently the Turkish-Armenian singer Sibil Pektoroso\u011flu (better known by her mononym Sibil) has become popular winning pan-Armenian music prizes for her recordings.\n\n===Cinema and acting===\nIn movie acting, special mention should be made of Vahi \u00d6z who appeared in countless movies from the 1940s until the late 1960s, Sami Hazinses (real name Samuel Agop Ulu\u00e7yan) who appeared in tens of Turkish movies from the 1950s until the 1990s and [[Nubar Terziyan]] who appeared in more than 400 movies. Movie actor and director Kenan Pars (real name Kirkor Cezveciyan) and theatre and film actress Irma Felekyan (aka Toto Karaca), who was mother of [[Cem Karaca]].\n\n===Photography===\nIn photography [[Ara G\u00fcler]] is a famous [[photojournalist]] of Armenian descent, nicknamed \"the Eye of Istanbul\" or \"the Photographer of Istanbul\".\n\n===Literature===\nTurkish Armenian novelists, poets, essayists and literary critics continue to play a very important role particularly in the literary scene of the [[Armenian diaspora]], with works of quality in Western Armenian.\n\nRobert Haddedjian chief editor of [[Marmara (newspaper)|Marmara]] newspaper published in [[Istanbul]] remains a pivotal figure in the literary criticism scene. [[Zahrad|Zareh Yaldizciyan]] (1923\u20132007), better known by his pen name Zahrad was a renowned Western Armenian poet.\n\n== Media ==\nIstanbul was home to a number of long-running and influential Armenian publications. Very notable now-defunct daily newspapers included ''[[Arevelk]]'' (1884\u20131915), ''[[Puzantyon]]'' (1896\u20131908), ''[[Sourhantag]]'' (1899\u20131908), ''[[Manzoume Efkyar]]'' (1912\u20131917), ''[[Vertchin Lour]]'' (1914\u20131924). Outside Istanbul, the notable daily publications included ''[[Arshalouys]]'' (1909\u20131914), ''[[Tashink]]'' (1909\u20131914) and ''[[Van (newspaper)|Van]]'' (1908\u20131909).\n\nPresently, Istanbul has two Armenian language dailies. These two newspapers, ''Jamanag'' (established in 1908) and ''Marmara'' also have a long tradition of keeping alive the Turkish Armenian literature, which is an integral part of the Western Armenian language and [[Armenian literature]].\n\n*''[[Jamanag]]'' (\u053a\u0561\u0574\u0561\u0576\u0561\u056f in [[Armenian language|Armenian]] meaning time) is a long-running Armenian language daily newspaper published in Istanbul, Turkey. The daily was established in 1908 by [[Misak Kochounian]] and has been somewhat a family establishment, given that it has been owned by the [[Kochounian family]] since its inception. After Misak Kochounian, it was passed down to [[Sarkis Kochounian]], and since 1992 is edited by [[Ara Kochounian]].\n*''[[Marmara (newspaper)|Marmara]]'', [http://www.normarmara.com/] daily in [[Armenian language|Armenian]] (Armenian: \u0544\u0561\u0580\u0574\u0561\u0580\u0561) (sometimes \"Nor Marmara\" - New Marmara) is an Armenian-language daily newspaper published since 1940 in Istanbul, Turkey. It was established by Armenian journalist [[Souren Shamlian]]. [[Rober Haddeciyan|Robert Haddeler]] took over the paper in 1967. ''Marmara'' is published six times a week (except on Sundays). The Friday edition contains a section in Turkish as well. Circulation is reported at 2000 per issue.\n*''[[Agos]]'', [http://www.agos.com.tr/] (Armenian: \u0531\u056f\u0585\u057d, \"Furrow\") is a bilingual Armenian weekly newspaper published in Istanbul in Turkish and Armenian. It was established on 5 April 1996. Today, it has a circulation of around 5,000. Besides Armenian and Turkish pages, the newspaper has an on-line English edition as well. [[Hrant Dink]] was its chief editor from the newspaper's start until his assassination outside of the newspaper's offices in Istanbul in January 2007. Hrant Dink's son [[Arat Dink]] served as the executive editor of the weekly after his assassination.\n*''[[Lraper]]'', [https://web.archive.org/web/20071009220119/http://www.lraper.org/ ] (\u053c\u0580\u0561\u0562\u0565\u0580  in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]) is a trilingual periodical publication in Armenian, Turkish and English languages and is the official organ of the [[Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople|Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople]]\n\nOther Armenian media titles include: ''[[Sourp Pergi\u00e7]]'' (St. Saviour) the magazine of the Armenian Sourp Pergi\u00e7 (Pergitch) Hospital, also ''[[Kulis]]'', ''[[Shoghagat]]'', ''[[Norsan]]'' and the humorous ''[[Jbid]]'' (smile in Armenian)\n\nIn September 2011, the Turkish government granted some financing to ''Jamanak'', ''Marmara'' and ''Agos'' as part of a wider campaign in support of existing minority newspapers in Turkey.<ref name=\"sabah\">''Dardaki az\u0131nl\u0131k gazetelerine bayram gecesi yard\u0131m\u0131...''

This massive exodus from the Ottoman Empire is what started the modern [[Armenian diaspora]] worldwide.\n\nThere was conflict between Armenians and Turks between 1892 and 1915.  The [[Armenian Genocide]]<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20100819160104/http://www.umd.umich.edu/dept/armenian/facts/ /gen_bib1.html Extensive bibliography by University of Michigan on the Armenian Genocide]</ref> followed in 1915\u20131916 until 1918, during \nwhich the Ottoman government of the time ordered the deportation and killing of more than 1 million Armenians. These measures affected an estimated 75\u201380% of all the Armenians living in the \nOttoman Empire during [[World War I]]. Many died directly through Ottoman massacres, while others died as a result of dehydration, disease, and starvation during the death marches and in the [[Syrian Desert]], and even more due to [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] raids on fleeing refugees during the death marches.\n\nAs for the remaining Armenians in the east, they found refuge by 1917\u20131918 in the [[Caucasus]] and within the areas controlled by the newly established [[Democratic Republic of Armenia]]. They never returned to their original homes in today's Eastern Turkey (composed of six [[vilayets]], [[Erzurum Vilayet|Erzurum]], [[Van Vilayet|Van]], [[Bitlis Vilayet|Bitlis]], [[Diyarbekir Vilayet|Diyarbak\u0131r]], [[Mamuret\u00fclaziz Vilayet|Mamuret\u00fclaziz]], and [[Sivas Vilayet|Sivas]]).\n\nTheir descendants are known as [[Hidden Armenians]] and are present throughout [[Western Armenia]], but particularly in Dersim ([[Tunceli]]). Through the 20th century, an unknown number of Armenians living in the mountainous region of Dersim converted to [[Alevism]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Armenian Elements in the Beliefs of the Kizilbash Kurds|url=http://rbedrosian.com/mmpaul1.htm|accessdate=28 April 2013|date=27 April 2013|newspaper=\u0130nternet Haber}}</ref> During the [[Armenian Genocide]], many of the Armenians in the region were saved by their [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] neighbors.<ref>{{cite book|last=A.

After the fall of French Cilicia, Some of those returnees attempted to stay permanently after the Turks gained the territory back, but were all driven away by the early 1930s due to various reasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://armenianweekly.com/2011/10/14/a-history-of-destruction/|title=A History of Destruction: The Fate of Armenian Church Properties in Adana [i]|author=Hairenik|work=Armenian Weekly}}</ref> Those who left the Mandate ended up in Syria, France, Armenia, the Americas and the rest of Europe, in that order. The Armenian population suffered a final blow with ongoing massacres and atrocities throughout the period 1920\u20131923, during the [[Turkish War of Independence]]. Those suffering the most were those Armenians remaining in the east and the south of Turkey, and the [[Pontic Greeks]] in the [[Black Sea Region]].\n\nBy the end of the 1920s, only a sprinkling of non-converted Armenians left in Turkey were scattered sparsely throughout the country, with the only viable Armenian population remaining in [[Istanbul]] and its environs, [[Diyarbakir]] and [[Malayta]], with those largely disappearing due to the [[Turkey-PKK War]] necessitating their migration to Istanbul. At the time of the establishment of the Republic of Turkey, [[Hatay Province]] was part of Syria, and is why that area still has some established and officially recognized Armenian communities.\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{See also|Demographics of Turkey|List of Turkish-Armenians}}\nDue to events in Turkey during the last century Turkish Armenians were killed, forced into hiding, and forcibly converted to Islam, which therefore split them into different groups. There are three groups- Armenian Christians, Crypto Armenians, and Muslim Armenians. Christian Armenians are in most cases part of the recognized minority, but can also include Crypto Armenians who are not legally recognized as Armenian but identify as both Armenian and Christian, and Armenian immigrants to Turkey. Crypto Armenians are Armenians who are legally identified as Turks and are either Christian and openly recognize their identity, hide their identity and either practice [[Crypto-Christianity]] or Islam, Openly identify as Armenian but are Muslim, or don't know about their ethnicity at all. The combined total of all Armenians in Turkey is unknown, because the number of people who are Crypto Armenian is hard to determine, with numbers ranging from as low as 30,000 to several million depending on how broad the standards were to be considered Crypto Armenian in the studies made. However, the combined total of immigrant Armenians and those in the recognized minority would be estimated at 150\u2013170,000. Another statistic could be the number of people who are members of the [[Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople]], being at 95,000.\n\n===Armenian Christians===\nThe officially recognized Armenian Christian population is estimated to be between 50,000 and 70,000, mostly living in [[Istanbul]] and its environs. They are almost always members of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]], [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian Catholic]] or [[Armenian Evangelical Church|Armenian Evangelical]] churches. The number of Armenian Christians is both diminishing due to emigration to [[Europe]], the [[Americas]] and [[Australia]], and increasing due to immigrants from Armenia looking for work (who are entirely Christian), and Crypto-Armenians who decide to identify openly as Armenians and convert to Christianity. However, most of that growth is not reflected in official data, because Crypto-Armenians are not listed as part of the recognized Armenian minority due to Turkish laws on the officially recognized(Armenians,Greeks, and Jews) minorities, which doesn't allow newly identified Armenians to change their Turkish identities they were given at birth. As for Armenian immigrants, most are unable to join the minority because they are illegal immigrants. Due to those factors, the [[de jure]] number of Armenian Christians is much lower than the [[de facto]] amount.\n\nThe Armenian minority is recognized as a separate [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|\"millet\"]] in the Turkish system and has its own religious, cultural, social and educational institutions along with a distinct media. The Turkish Armenian community struggles to keep its own institutions, media and schools open due to diminishing demand from emigration and quite considerable economic sacrifices.\n\n====Regions with Armenian Christians====\n\n=====[[Istanbul Province|Istanbul]]=====\n{{main|Armenians in Istanbul}}\nThe Armenian Community of [[Istanbul]] is the largest in Turkey, a catalyst being due to the fact that it was the only place that Armenian Christians were at least somewhat protected at the time of the creation of Turkey post Armenian Genocide. Other factors included the Patriarchate having its headquarters in the city, and the city's economy and quality of life attracting Armenian immigrants which allowed for the community to keep stable numbers in the face of [[Istanbul Pogrom|discrimination]] and constant migration, unlike the Greek community, which by comparison had far less or no immigration and now has only 2000\u20133000, mostly elderly members, regardless of the fact it had far more members than the Armenian community starting in 1924 (the first post genocide census).\n\nThe three most important Armenian districts in Istanbul are the [[Kumkap\u0131]], [[Ye\u015filk\u00f6y]], and [[Pangalti]] districts, as well as the [[Prince Islands]]. Kumkapi is the location of the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople, and is known for its many fish restaurants and historic Churches. One of the main differences between the districts is that Kumkapi is [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Apostolic]], While Pangalti has a mix of [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian]] and [[Roman Catholic]], and Yesilk\u00f6y is mostly Armenian Catholic, Roman Catholic and Syriac Orthodox. Kumkapi is also located in the [[Fatih|Old city]], while Pangalti is in the [[\u015ei\u015fli|newer part]], and Yesilk\u00f6y is a District within Greater Istanbul next to the outer walls of the Fatih District.\n\n=====[[Hatay Province]]=====\n[[Iskenderun]] has one small Armenian church, and a community of a few dozen Armenians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anadolukatolikkilisesi.org/iskenderun/en/cristiani.asp|title=Iskenderun: Catholic Church - Katolik Kilisesi - Chiesa Cattolica - Katholischer Church|work=anadolukatolikkilisesi.org|access-date=2015-07-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305192407/http://www.anadolukatolikkilisesi.org/iskenderun/en/cristiani.asp|archive-date=2016-03-05|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[Vak\u0131fl\u0131, Samanda\u011f|Vak\u0131fl\u0131 K\u00f6y\u00fc]] ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: {{lang|hy|\u054e\u0561\u0584\u056b\u0586}} \u2014 '''Vakif''') is the only remaining fully ethnic Armenian village in [[Turkey]].

The unprecedented apology was initiated by a group of 200 Turkish academics, journalists, writers and artists disagreeing with the official Turkish version of what many historians consider the first genocide of the 20th century. Their petition, entitled \"[[I Apologize campaign|I apologize]]\", was posted on a special website http://www.ozurdiliyoruz.com/.\n\nOn the occasion of a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] qualifying match between the two [[Turkey national football team|national football teams of Turkey]] and [[Armenia national football team|Armenia]] in the Armenian capital [[Yerevan]], and following the [[President of Armenia|Armenian President]] [[Serzh Sargsyan]]'s invitation to attend the match, on 6 September 2008, the [[President of Turkey|Turkish President]] [[Abdullah G\u00fcl]] paid a breakthrough landmark visit to Armenia that he said \"promises hope for the future\" for the two countries.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7602066.stm|title=Gul in landmark visit to Armenia|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2015|work=BBC News|date=6 September 2008}}</ref> The Armenian president Sargsyan will reciprocate the visit to Turkey during 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20081124/118514291.html|title=Armenian president to visit Turkey next year|author=Sputnik|date=24 November 2008|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Local politics===\n\nThe Armenians in Turkey used to be active in Turkish politics.

The Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople has exerted a very significant political role earlier and today still exercises a spiritual authority, which earns it considerable respect among [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox churches]]. The Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople recognizes the primacy of the [[Catholicos of All Armenians|Supreme Patriarch and Catholicos of All Armenians]], in the spiritual and administrative headquarters of the Armenian Church, the [[Etchmiadzin|Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin]], [[Etchmiadzin|Vagharshapat, Republic of Armenia]], in matters that pertain to the worldwide [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Church]].

The reason for this is historical; according to Armenians, Christians once celebrated Christmas on 6 January, until the 4th century. 25 December was originally a [[pagan]] holiday that celebrated the birth of the sun. Many members of the church continued to celebrate both holidays, and the Roman church changed the date of Christmas to be 25 December and declared January 6 to be the date when the [[three wise men]] visited the baby Jesus. As the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] had already separated from the Roman church at that time, the date of Christmas remained unchanged for Armenians.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lraper.org/main.aspx?Action=DisplayNews&NewsCode=N000001752&Lang=ENG | title=Why Do Armenians Celebrate Christmas on 6 January? | publisher=Armenian Patriarchate of Istanbul | accessdate=2007-01-04 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926222541/http://www.lraper.org/main.aspx?Action=DisplayNews&NewsCode=N000001752&Lang=ENG | archive-date=2007-09-26 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe Armenians in Turkey refer to Christmas as ''Surp Dz\u0131nunt'' (Holy Birth) and have fifty days of preparation called ''Hisnag'' before Christmas.

Partly because of this, [[Istanbul]] veritably became the cultural and literary center of the Western Armenians in the 19th and early 20th century.\n\nWestern Armenian is the language spoken by almost all of the [[Armenian diaspora]]. The only diaspora community that uses [[Eastern Armenian]] is the [[Iranian Armenian]] community, or those who immigrated from Armenia. Nevertheless, Western Armenian is the primary dialect of Armenian found in [[North America|North]] and [[South America]], [[Europe]] (except [[Russian Armenians|those in Russia]]) and most of the [[Middle East]] (except in [[Iran]] and [[Armenia]]). Western Armenian is the primary language of the diaspora because the great majority of the [[Armenian diaspora]] in all these areas (Europe, Americas, Middle East) was formed in the 19th and early 20th century by Armenian populations from the Ottoman Empire, which is where Western Armenian was historically spoken.\n\nNevertheless, The Western Armenian language is still spoken by a small minority of the present-day Armenian community in Turkey. However, Only 18 percent of the Armenian community speaks Western Armenian, while 82 percent of the Armenian community speaks Turkish. This percentage is even lower among younger people of whom only 8 percent speaks Western Armenian and 92 percent speaks Turkish.<ref name=\"community\" /> \nTurkish is replacing Western Armenian as a [[mother language]], and [[UNESCO]] has added Western Armenian in its annual \"Atlas of the World\u2019s Languages in Danger\"  where the Western Armenian language in Turkey is defined as a '''[[endangered language|definitely endangered language]]'''.<ref name=\"unesco.org\">[http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00206 UNESCO Culture Sector, UNESCO Interactive Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger, 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222090430/http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?pg=00206 |date=February 22, 2009 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.bianet.org/english/kategori/english/112728/unesco-15-languages-endangered-in-turkey UNESCO: 15 Languages Endangered in Turkey, by T.

This is popularly known as Armeno-Turkish.\n\nArmeno-Turkish was not used just by Armenians, but also many non-Armenian elite (including the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Turkish intellectuals) could actually read the Armenian-alphabet Turkish language texts.\n\nThe Armenian alphabet was also used alongside the Arabic alphabet on official documents of the Ottoman Empire, written in [[Ottoman language|Ottoman Turkish]]. For example, the [[Aleppo]] edition of the official gazette of the Ottoman Empire, called \"Frat\" (Turkish and Arabic for the Euphrates) contained a Turkish section of laws printed in Armenian alphabet.\n\nAlso very notably, the first [[novel]] to be written in the Ottoman Empire was 1851's ''[[Akabi Hikayesi]]'', written by Armenian statesman, journalist and novelist [[Vartan Pasha]] (Hovsep Vartanian) in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], was published with [[Armenian script]]. ''Akabi Hikayesi'' depicted an impossible love story between two young people coming from two different communities amidst hostility and adversity.\n\nWhen the Armenian [[Duzian family]] managed the Ottoman mint during the reign of [[Abd\u00fclmecid I]], they kept their records in Ottoman Turkish written in Armenian script.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mansel|first=Philip|title=Constantinople|year=2011|publisher=Hachette UK|isbn=978-1848546479|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LrnvC98bNSoC}}</ref>\n\nGreat collection of Armeno-Turkish could be found in Christian Armenian worship until the late 1950s. The [[Bible]] used by many Armenians in the Ottoman Empire was not only the Bible versions printed in Armenian, but also at times the translated [[Turkish language]] Bibles using the [[Armenian alphabet]]. Usage continued in Armenian church gatherings specially for those who were Turkophones rather than Armenophones. Many of the Christian spiritual songs used in certain Armenian churches were also in Armeno-Turkish.\n\n===Armenians and the Turkish language===\n[[File:Istanbul - Armenian school - P1040046.JPG|thumb|The Armenian school in Kumkapi, Istanbul (next to the Surp Asdvadzadzin Patriarchal Church)]]\nArmenians played a key role in the promotion of the [[Turkish language]] including the reforms of the [[Turkish language]] initiated by [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]].\n\n[[Bedros Keresteciyan]], the Ottoman [[linguist]] completed the first [[etymological dictionary]] of Turkish. Armenians contributed considerably to the development of printing in Turkey: [[Tokatl\u0131 Apkar T\u0131bir]] started a printing house in Istanbul in 1567, the historian [[Eremia \u00c7elebi]], [[Merzifonlu Krikor]], [[Sivasl\u0131 Parseh]], [[Hagop Brothers]], [[Ha\u00e7ik Kevorkyan]] Abraham from Thrace, E\u011finli [[Bogos Arabian]], [[Hovannes Muhendisian]], [[Rephael Kazancian]] were among many. [[Bogos Arabian]] issued the first Turkish daily newspaper, ''[[Takvim-i Vekayi]]'' and its translation to Armenian. [[Hovannes Muhendisian]] is known as the \"Turkish Gutenberg\". [[Ha\u00e7ik Kevorkyan]] updated the [[Ottoman Turkish alphabet]]. [[Yervant M\u0131s\u0131rl\u0131yan]] developed and implemented publishing books in installments for the first time in the Ottoman Empire. [[Kasap Efendi]], published the first Comic magazine ''[[Diyojen]]'' in 1870. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n[[Agop Dil\u00e2\u00e7ar]] (1895\u20131979) was a Turkish Armenian [[linguistics|linguist]] who had great contribution to the reform of [[Turkish language]]. He specialized in [[Turkic languages]] and was the first Secretary General and head specialist of the [[Turkish Language Association]] (TLA) from its establishment in 1932 until 1979. In addition to [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]], Martayan knew [[English language|English]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Latin]], [[German language|German]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]. He was invited on September 22, 1932, as a linguistics specialist to the ''[[First Turkish Language Congress]]'' supervised by [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]]. [[Istepan Gurdikyan]] (1865\u20131948), [[linguist]], [[Turcology|Turcologist]], educator and academic and [[Kevork \u015eimke\u015fyan]] both ethnic Armenians were also prominent speakers at the first Turkish Language Conference. [[Agop Martayan Dila\u00e7ar]] continued his work and research on the [[Turkish language]] as the head specialist and Secretary General of the newly founded Turkish Language Association in [[Ankara]]. Atat\u00fcrk suggested him the surname ''Dila\u00e7ar'' (literally meaning ''language opener''), which he accepted. He taught history and language at [[Ankara University]] between 1936 and 1951 and was the head advisor of the ''T\u00fcrk Ansiklopedisi'' (''Turkish Encyclopedia''), between 1942 and 1960. He held his position and continued his research in linguistics at the Turkish Language Association until his death in 1979.\n\n==Culture==\nArmenians try to keep a rich cultural life and do participate in the Turkish art scene.\n\n===Music===\nThe pan-Turkish [[Karde\u015f T\u00fcrk\u00fcler]] cultural and musical formation, in addition to performing a rich selection of Turkish, Kurdish, Georgian, Arabic and gypsy musical numbers, also includes a number of beautiful interpretation of Armenian traditional music in its repertoire. It gave sold-out concerts in [[Armenia]] as part of the Turkish-Armenian Cultural Program, which was made possible with support from [[USAID]].\n\nThe \"Sayat-Nova\" choir was founded in 1971 under the sponsorship of the St. Children\u2019s Church of Istanbul performs traditional Armenian songs and studies and interprets Armenian folk music.\n\nIn classical opera music and theatre, Toto Karaca was a major figure on the stage. In the folk tradition, the effect of [[Udi Hrant Kenkulian]] as a legendary [[oud]] player is indisputable.\n\nIn contemporary music, [[Arto Tun\u00e7boyac\u0131yan]] and his brother the late [[Onno Tun\u00e7]] are two veritable jazz musicians, composers and arrangers.

From the fifth to the third millennia B.C., in the higher regions of [[Armenia]], the land of [[Mount Ararat|Ararat]], there are rock paintings of scenes of country dancing. These [[dance]]s were probably accompanied by certain kinds of songs or musical instruments. In the fifth century Moses of Khoren (Movs\u00e9s Khorenats'i) himself had heard of how the old descendants of [[Aram (given name)|Aram]] (that is [[Armenians]]) make mention of these things (epic tales) in the ballads for the lyre and their songs and dances.\n\nTraditional dancing is still popular among expatriate Armenians, and has also been very successfully `exported' to international folk dance groups and circle dance groups all over the world. All dancers wear the traditional costume to embody the history of their culture and tell their ancestors stories. The design of these costumes are influenced by many factors, such as religious traditions, family methods, and practicality. The traditional coloring and exquisite beading of the costumes ties the dance and the tradition together. The beautiful movements of the Armenian cultural dance are adored by all audience around the world.<ref>Gary Lind-Sinanian - ALMA</ref>\n\n==Religious dancing==\nThe origin of religious dancing is ancient, an expression of the inner feelings of those who participated in such performances. It is of interest to note that dance never occurred alone, but was always accompanied with song, clapping of hands, and musical instruments. As with music, so too the dance expressed a person\u2019s internal spiritual emotions and personal disposition.<ref>\"The Shepherd and His Flock\"\u2014By Rev.

From the fifth to the third millennia B.C., in the higher regions of [[Armenia]], the land of [[Mount Ararat|Ararat]], there are rock paintings of scenes of country dancing. These [[dance]]s were probably accompanied by certain kinds of songs or musical instruments. In the fifth century Moses of Khoren (Movs\u00e9s Khorenats'i) himself had heard of how the old descendants of [[Aram (given name)|Aram]] (that is [[Armenians]]) make mention of these things (epic tales) in the ballads for the lyre and their songs and dances.\n\nTraditional dancing is still popular among expatriate Armenians, and has also been very successfully `exported' to international folk dance groups and circle dance groups all over the world. All dancers wear the traditional costume to embody the history of their culture and tell their ancestors stories. The design of these costumes are influenced by many factors, such as religious traditions, family methods, and practicality. The traditional coloring and exquisite beading of the costumes ties the dance and the tradition together. The beautiful movements of the Armenian cultural dance are adored by all audience around the world.<ref>Gary Lind-Sinanian - ALMA</ref>\n\n==Religious dancing==\nThe origin of religious dancing is ancient, an expression of the inner feelings of those who participated in such performances. It is of interest to note that dance never occurred alone, but was always accompanied with song, clapping of hands, and musical instruments. As with music, so too the dance expressed a person\u2019s internal spiritual emotions and personal disposition.<ref>\"The Shepherd and His Flock\"\u2014By Rev. Zenob Nalbandian</ref>\n\n==Soviet Union==\nDuring the 1920s and 30s, three Armenian dance teachers moved to [[Iran]] from the [[Soviet Union]] and opened dance schools. Their names were Madame Yelena, Madame Coronelli, and [[Sarkis Djanbazian]]. They taught [[ballet]] and [[character dance]]. Most of their students were members of the Armenian community in Tehran, but their classes were also attended by students from diverse backgrounds including Muslims, Jews, Baha'is and Zoroastrians.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press, USA| isbn = 978-0-19-973946-2| last1 = Fisher| first1 = Jennifer| last2 = Shay| first2 = Anthony| title = When Men Dance:Choreographing Masculinities Across Borders| date = 2009-09-07}}</ref>\n\n==Folk dances==\n[[Image:Armeniapedia dance2.jpg|thumb|250px|Traditional Armenian Dance]]\n[[Image:Armeniapedia dance1.jpg|thumb|250px|Traditional Armenian Dance]]\n* {{transl|hye|[[Kochari]]}} (\u0554\u0578\u0579\u0561\u0580\u056b) - Kochari is one of the most popular dances of Armenians.

The highlands are divided into western and eastern regions, defined by the Ararat Valley where [[Mount Ararat]] is located.

During the [[Middle Ages]], [[Arabs]] and particularly [[Turkic migrations#Turkmens|Turkmens]] and [[Kurds]] settled in large numbers in the Armenian Highlands. The Christian population of the [[Western Armenia|western half]] of the region was [[Genocide|exterminated]] during the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915, and on a smaller scale, the [[Assyrian Genocide|Assyrian]] and [[Greek Genocide]]s.\n\nToday, the eastern half is mainly inhabited by Armenians, [[Azerbaijanis]], and [[Georgians]], while the western half is mainly inhabited by Azerbaijanis, Kurds (including [[Yazidis]]), [[Turkish people|Turks]], and [[Zazas]], with a minority of [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]].\n\n==Geography==\nThe Armenian Highlands is part of the [[Alpide belt]], forming part of the [[Asia]]n range that stretches from the [[Pontic Mountains]] to the [[Malay Peninsula]].
