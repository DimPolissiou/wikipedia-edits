{"title_page": "List of best-selling video games", "text_new": "{{pp|small=yes}}\n{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Video Games}}\n{{Dynamic list}}\nThis is a '''list of the best-selling video games''' of all time. The best-selling [[video game]] to date is ''[[Minecraft]]'', a [[sandbox video game]] originally released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], and [[Linux]] in 2011. The game has been ported to a wide range of platforms, selling over 180 million copies, including paid [[mobile game|mobile downloads]]. ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' is the only other game to have sold over 100 million copies. The best-selling game on a single platform is ''[[Wii Sports]]'', with nearly 83 million sales for the [[Wii]] console.\n\nOf the top 50 best-selling video games on this list, over half were developed or published by [[Nintendo]], including over half of the top ten. Four games were published by Nintendo and their affiliate, [[The Pok\u00e9mon Company]]. Other publishers with multiple entries in the top 50 include [[Activision]], [[Rockstar Games]], [[Electronic Arts]], and [[Sega]]. Aside from Nintendo's internal development teams, [[Game Freak]] is the developer with the most games in the top 50, with five from the ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'' series. The oldest game in the top 50 is ''[[Frogger]]'', which was released in June 1981. Games reported on by player count instead of official sales figures, such as registered accounts, subscriptions, or [[free-to-play]] ownership, are to be included on the [[list of most-played video games by player count]] instead.\n\n==List==<!--As per a previous discussion, Tetris is a game series. Rather than counting the entire series as a single game, the series' highest selling entry (the GameBoy version) is included on this list.-->\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n!#\n!

The best-selling [[video game]] to date is ''[[Minecraft]]'', a [[sandbox video game]] originally released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], and [[Linux]] in 2011. The game has been ported to a wide range of platforms, selling over 180 million copies, including paid [[mobile game|mobile downloads]]. ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' is the only other game to have sold over 100 million copies. The best-selling game on a single platform is ''[[Wii Sports]]'', with nearly 83 million sales for the [[Wii]] console.\n\nOf the top 50 best-selling video games on this list, over half were developed or published by [[Nintendo]], including over half of the top ten. Four games were published by Nintendo and their affiliate, [[The Pok\u00e9mon Company]]. Other publishers with multiple entries in the top 50 include [[Activision]], [[Rockstar Games]], [[Electronic Arts]], and [[Sega]]. Aside from Nintendo's internal development teams, [[Game Freak]] is the developer with the most games in the top 50, with five from the ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'' series. The oldest game in the top 50 is ''[[Frogger]]'', which was released in June 1981. Games reported on by player count instead of official sales figures, such as registered accounts, subscriptions, or [[free-to-play]] ownership, are to be included on the [[list of most-played video games by player count]] instead.\n\n==List==<!--As per a previous discussion, Tetris is a game series. Rather than counting the entire series as a single game, the series' highest selling entry (the GameBoy version) is included on this list.-->\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\"\n|-\n!#\n!

{"title_page": "Makholokoe Tribes", "text_new": "{{no footnotes|date=September 2019}}\n\n== Kholokoe Tribe ==\n\n=== Classification ===\nMakgolokoe/Makholokoe/Makgolokwe/Bakholokoe refers to the '''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tswana_people Bakgatla Tribe]''' of Morena Khetsi/Kgetsi son for [https://journals.co.za/docserver/fulltext/high/2/1/2134.pdf?expires=1585766743&id=id&accname=guest&checksum=DAA89AB77A1BFD8B88652B2562EFF7DC Morena Tabane]. The Ba/Ma-kholokoe are found in the Easter Free State (Harrismith, Wetsieshoek, Vrede, Kestel, etc.), Kwazulu/Natal(Nqutu) and Mpumalanga (Daggakraal, Amersfoort) as their historical residence. The Ba/Ma-kholokoe are the descendants of the originally Bantu-Speaking tribes from the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantu_peoples central Congo region who migrated Southwards around 600 AD]. They are the offspring of Bakgatla Chief Tabane and Mathulare daughter of the Bafokeng Chief. Tabane fathered five sons, Diale, Kgetsi, Kgwadi (Motl\u00f4kwa), Matsibolo/Matsiboho, and Mosia (in order of their birth). Each broke away to form Bapedi, Ba/Ma-kholokwe, Batl\u00f4kwa, Maphuthing and Basia respectively. Ba/Ma-kholokoe demonstrated linguistic and cultural characteristics that distinguished them from other Bantu-speakers of southern Africa, with their language showing a merger of South Sotho and [[Nguni language]]s. Other practices included totemism (Ba/Ma-kholokoe totem is Phuthi - Duiker, some still hold on to the fowl, while others the porcupine), the preferential marriage of paternal cousins, and an architectural style characterized by a round hut with a conical thatch roof. The senior house of Ba/Ma-Kholokoe is the house of Moduli/Molupi, they are the Makholokoe a Letseba \"letseba le letsebilae ke mang, le Mokholoane a shoele a sa le tsebe\". Tabane first son from his senior wife Matlaisane remained with the Bakgatla ba Mot\u0161ha group, after Tabane concurred the Ba-Venda nation he married a Ba-Venda wife and fathered a son called Davhana who fathered Vele.\n\n=== History (Nalane) ===\n \nThe traditions of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolong_tribe Barolong kingdoms] indicate that at some time in the past up until the leadership battles of the 14th Century they were all under the same rule of a line of kings who claimed descent from a common ancestor, Morolong. Following the death of Morolong's 4th generation great- grandson Masilo there was a leadership crisis that resulted in the formation of the Ba-Hurutshe and Ba-Kwena clans. Ba/Ma-kholokoe claim lineage from the Ba-Hurutshe clan and traced their early ancestry to Mokgatla, the founder of the BaKgatla and his 4th generation great grandson Tabane. \n\nAround 1560 Kgetsi/Khetsi(Lekholokoe) son of Tabane married Mabale and fathered Moloi, Moloi married Maleseha and fathered Hlabathe, Hlabathe fathered Sehoala/Sehoele, Sehoala married Malekoesa and fathered Tjale, Tjale fathered Tsholedi, Tsholedi married Malekunya and fathered Motsoane, Motsoane fathered Mokholoane, fathered Matsemela who married Madiale and fathered the five known houses of Kholokoe Leubane, Maphale, Tsele, Motaoane and with Matsholedi fathered Lehasa. \n\nBefore the birth of Kgetsi/Khetsi, his father Tabane with other Bakgatla lived around \"Thaba tsa Mohale\" known today as [[Magaliesberg]], during the 1600s Kgetsi/Khetsi took his group and moved eastwards and North of Lekoa (Vaal) settling near Seratoe today [[Standerton]], at a mountain which since their occupation became Thaba Kholokoe.  This is where Ba/Ma-kholokoe lived for over 200 years, about eight to nine generations until the attacks of Matiwane in 1822, Mzilikazi in 1823 and is considered the birthplace of Ba/Ma-khlokoe. Some of the Ba/Ma-kholokoe Kings/Chief that lived in Thaba Kholokoe:\n- Kgetsi\n- Moloi\n- Hlabate\n- Sehoaba/Sehoele\n- Tyale\n- Tsholedi\n- Motsoane\n- Mokholoane\n- Matsemela\nFrom Thaba Kholokoe Ba/Ma-kholokoe spread to many areas around the Free State and Natal. One group under the leadership of Morena Wetsi (Oetsi) settled in today's Wetsieshoek, where many Ba/Ma-kholokoe were killed inside a [[Witsie's Cave (Lekhalong la Witsie)|cave]] during a war against the Boers. The kinship/chieftaincy of Bakholokoe has always been marked by disagreement and internal feuds, living the legacy for this leadership still in question to this day. \n\nAlthough many consider the totem of Ba/Ma-kholokoe as a [[:nso:Phuti|Phuthi]] (duiker), it is believed that this small antelope led Bakholokoe to safety during a war, there are some that say the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe totem is a porcupine [[Porcupine]].\n\n=== Land (Naha) ===\n \nAlthough one would love to hear the anecdotal side of the Ba-Kholokoe Tribe history, it is unfortunately heavily clouded by the ever-present and festering issue of land and property dispossession and subsequent brutal oppression and painful suffering of the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe, first from the Dutch \u2015Boer\u2016 Government (Volksraad) of the Free State, and subsequently from the British Orange River Colony Administration and even in the modern times, especially under the Bantustan (Native Homelands) system of the nineteen seventy's and the nineteen eighty's, during which period people like the late Qwaqwa Homeland Prime Minister T.K.Mopeli, ruthlessly sought to and nearly achieved destroying the BaKholokoe Tribe! Much of the history written today states that Qwaqwa formerly known as Wetsieshoek was residence to only two Basotho tribes Bakoena and Batlokoa completely ignoring the presence of Ba/Ma-Kholokoe.\n\nLike many other tribes, Bakholokoe were dispossessed of their land leading to their traditional leaders, the Batlokoa traditional leaders and the then secretary of Bakholokoe traditional council  [[Josiah_Tshangana_Gumede|JT Gumede]] going to England in 1906 to protest the Bakhlokoe and Batlokoa losing their ancestral land to the former Boer republics. \n\nAs early as 1837 the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe tribe was already resident in the northern Free State around the Maluti region, Northern Natal around the Klip River region and the Vaal River region, notably the areas of the Witsieshoek district and the Harrismith district. In 1856 the Ba-Kholokoe, under Morena Wetsi, were forcefully dispossessed of this part of their territory by the Free State Dutch Government, on wholly unjustifiable pretenses, only two years after the Convention of Bloemfontein of 1854.\n\nIn 1866 Commandant C. de Villiers, also popularly known as Masoothonyane, who was then in charge of the Thaba Nchu, i.e. Harrismith district, and a member of the Volksraad, requested the tribes to assist the Free State Government in the war against Moshoeshoe. They rendered military service as the Free Burgher Natives, and their armed contingents were known as the \u2015Witlaps\u2016 and the \u2015Ringhals\u2016. The services were rendered firstly in consideration to secure and confirm the Tribes in free possession of the lands they then occupied, and secondly after successful conclusion of that war in 1868, for the payment of 9450 head of cattle to Commandant De Villiers acting for his Government, he agreed to the enlargement of the lands occupied by the Tribes. He, De Villiers actually promised them that the land, approximately 2130 square miles (551 667 hectares) - which the tribes were already occupying, would be secured for them. This is war talk, since in a way he was indirectly saying that this land that they were occupying could at any time be expropriated, if need be by forceful declaration and action, from them. \n\nAt least up to and according to the guarantees of the Proclamation of 1848, no land occupied by these Tribes had been encroached by any Europeans, so De Villiers appeared to be acting in good faith as based on that Proclamation. After the conclusion of the war in 1868, for the payment of 9450 cattle, it was agreed that all the land occupied mainly by two tribes, BaTlokoa and Ba-Kholokoe, who assisted Commandant De Villiers and the Boers in the war against Moshoeshoe, would then be given to them, after it has also been enlarged. There were three payments which were made for the purchase of three different areas of the land: 2450 cattle paid for the Halspruit area, made by the BaTlokoa tribe, 4000 cattle paid for the Klip Rivier area, the land situated in the Vrede and Harrismith Districts, also made by the BaTlokoa tribe, and 3000 cattle paid for the Mill River Valley in the Harrismith district, made by the Ba-Kholokoe tribe. The payments for the land of the Ba-Tlokoa tribe were made by Morena Lesisa Tsotetsi, who was representing heirs of Morena Letika and Morena Lesala, both who were the late Marena (Chiefs) of the Ba-Tlokoa tribe. He paid the combined 6450 cattle for both the Halspruit and Klip Rivier areas, which were largely occupied by the Ba-Tlokoa tribe. The Halspruit area was home to the Ba-Tlokoa tribe under the late Morena Lesala, and the Klip Rivier area was under the late Morena Letika, both of whom were now represented by Morena Lesisa. The payment for the Mill River Valley land, which covered both Thabantsu and Witsieshoek districts of the Ba-Kholokoe Tribe was made by Morena Letlatsa Moloi, who was representing heirs of the Late Morena Hlomise, son of the late Morena Oetsi (\u2015Witsie\u2016) of the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe. However, in 1888 the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe, after having received notice to leave the land, were forcibly evicted without any compensation. The struggle to regain their land had begun. \n\nChief Letlatsa Moloi of the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe became a thorn in the flesh for Captain John Quayle Dickson, the Advisor for Native Affairs in the British Colonial Orange Free State government. On the 5th of September 1903, Captain John Quayle Dickson wrote to Sir Harry Smith from his office in Bloemfontein indicating that he had visited Thabantsu (Harrismith) where he and the Regional Magistrate of the Thaba Nchu territory had personally met and informed Paramount Chief Letlasa of the Ba-Kholokoe Tribe that from then onwards he would be granted no special privileges whatsoever, and that he was now stripped of his position as one of the well-known and respected Morena oa Ba-Kholokoe, declaring him to be \u2015just another Native\u2016, and therefore from then in his opinion Paramount Chief Letlatsa will give no further trouble. Yet more trouble from the cheated and dispossessed tribes was coming! The boundaries of these areas were well defined as verified at the inquiry held in Harrismith by Captain John Quayle Dickson, Advisor for Native affairs, and Magistrate Leary, as reported in Captain Dickson's letter of 23rd June 1906. A Mr. F Van Reenen also testified to the fact that Commander De Villiers had cheated these native Chiefs in dealing with them, and when this was brought to the knowledge of the Free State government, it forced his resignation from the Volksraad.\n\n=== Battles fought by Ba/Ma-Kholokoe ===\n\nSome of the history states that Ba/Ma-Kholokoe were not great warriors but according to the battles fought, won and lost the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe were as good warriors as any other tribe that lived in that era.

The Ba/Ma-kholokoe are found in the Easter Free State (Harrismith, Wetsieshoek, Vrede, Kestel, etc.), Kwazulu/Natal(Nqutu) and Mpumalanga (Daggakraal, Amersfoort) as their historical residence. The Ba/Ma-kholokoe are the descendants of the originally Bantu-Speaking tribes from the central Congo region who migrated Southwards around 600 AD. They are the offspring of Bakgatla Chief Tabane and Mathulare daughter of the Bafokeng Chief. Tabane fathered five sons, Diale, Kgetsi, Kgwadi (Motl\u00f4kwa), Matsibolo/Matsiboho, and Mosia (in order of their birth). Each broke away to form Bapedi, Ba/Ma-kholokwe, Batl\u00f4kwa, Maphuthing and Basia respectively. Ba/Ma-kholokoe demonstrated linguistic and cultural characteristics that distinguished them from other Bantu-speakers of southern Africa, with their language showing a merger of South Sotho and [[Nguni language]]s. Other practices included totemism (Ba/Ma-kholokoe totem is Phuthi - Duiker, some still hold on to the fowl, while others the porcupine), the preferential marriage of paternal cousins, and an architectural style characterized by a round hut with a conical thatch roof. The senior house of Ba/Ma-Kholokoe is the house of Moduli/Molupi, they are the Makholokoe a Letseba \"letseba le letsebilae ke mang, le Mokholoane a shoele a sa le tsebe\". Tabane first son from his senior wife Matlaisane remained with the Bakgatla ba Mot\u0161ha group, after Tabane concurred the Ba-Venda nation he married a Ba-Venda wife and fathered a son called Davhana who fathered Vele.\n\n=== History (Nalane) ===\n \nThe traditions of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolong_tribe Barolong kingdoms] indicate that at some time in the past up until the leadership battles of the 14th Century they were all under the same rule of a line of kings who claimed descent from a common ancestor, Morolong. Following the death of Morolong's 4th generation great- grandson Masilo there was a leadership crisis that resulted in the formation of the Ba-Hurutshe and Ba-Kwena clans. Ba/Ma-kholokoe claim lineage from the Ba-Hurutshe clan and traced their early ancestry to Mokgatla, the founder of the BaKgatla and his 4th generation great grandson Tabane. \n\nAround 1560 Kgetsi/Khetsi(Lekholokoe) son of Tabane married Mabale and fathered Moloi, Moloi married Maleseha and fathered Hlabathe, Hlabathe fathered Sehoala/Sehoele, Sehoala married Malekoesa and fathered Tjale, Tjale fathered Tsholedi, Tsholedi married Malekunya and fathered Motsoane, Motsoane fathered Mokholoane, fathered Matsemela who married Madiale and fathered the five known houses of Kholokoe Leubane, Maphale, Tsele, Motaoane and with Matsholedi fathered Lehasa. \n\nBefore the birth of Kgetsi/Khetsi, his father Tabane with other Bakgatla lived around \"Thaba tsa Mohale\" known today as [[Magaliesberg]], during the 1600s Kgetsi/Khetsi took his group and moved eastwards and North of Lekoa (Vaal) settling near Seratoe today [[Standerton]], at a mountain which since their occupation became Thaba Kholokoe.  This is where Ba/Ma-kholokoe lived for over 200 years, about eight to nine generations until the attacks of Matiwane in 1822, Mzilikazi in 1823 and is considered the birthplace of Ba/Ma-khlokoe. Some of the Ba/Ma-kholokoe Kings/Chief that lived in Thaba Kholokoe:\n- Kgetsi\n- Moloi\n- Hlabate\n- Sehoaba/Sehoele\n- Tyale\n- Tsholedi\n- Motsoane\n- Mokholoane\n- Matsemela\nFrom Thaba Kholokoe Ba/Ma-kholokoe spread to many areas around the Free State and Natal. One group under the leadership of Morena Wetsi (Oetsi) settled in today's Wetsieshoek, where many Ba/Ma-kholokoe were killed inside a [[Witsie's Cave (Lekhalong la Witsie)|cave]] during a war against the Boers. The kinship/chieftaincy of Bakholokoe has always been marked by disagreement and internal feuds, living the legacy for this leadership still in question to this day. \n\nAlthough many consider the totem of Ba/Ma-kholokoe as a [[:nso:Phuti|Phuthi]] (duiker), it is believed that this small antelope led Bakholokoe to safety during a war, there are some that say the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe totem is a porcupine [[Porcupine]].\n\n=== Land (Naha) ===\n \nAlthough one would love to hear the anecdotal side of the Ba-Kholokoe Tribe history, it is unfortunately heavily clouded by the ever-present and festering issue of land and property dispossession and subsequent brutal oppression and painful suffering of the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe, first from the Dutch \u2015Boer\u2016 Government (Volksraad) of the Free State, and subsequently from the British Orange River Colony Administration and even in the modern times, especially under the Bantustan (Native Homelands) system of the nineteen seventy's and the nineteen eighty's, during which period people like the late Qwaqwa Homeland Prime Minister T.K.Mopeli, ruthlessly sought to and nearly achieved destroying the BaKholokoe Tribe! Much of the history written today states that Qwaqwa formerly known as Wetsieshoek was residence to only two Basotho tribes Bakoena and Batlokoa completely ignoring the presence of Ba/Ma-Kholokoe.\n\nLike many other tribes, Bakholokoe were dispossessed of their land leading to their traditional leaders, the Batlokoa traditional leaders and the then secretary of Bakholokoe traditional council  [[Josiah_Tshangana_Gumede|JT Gumede]] going to England in 1906 to protest the Bakhlokoe and Batlokoa losing their ancestral land to the former Boer republics. \n\nAs early as 1837 the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe tribe was already resident in the northern Free State around the Maluti region, Northern Natal around the Klip River region and the Vaal River region, notably the areas of the Witsieshoek district and the Harrismith district. In 1856 the Ba-Kholokoe, under Morena Wetsi, were forcefully dispossessed of this part of their territory by the Free State Dutch Government, on wholly unjustifiable pretenses, only two years after the Convention of Bloemfontein of 1854.\n\nIn 1866 Commandant C. de Villiers, also popularly known as Masoothonyane, who was then in charge of the Thaba Nchu, i.e. Harrismith district, and a member of the Volksraad, requested the tribes to assist the Free State Government in the war against Moshoeshoe. They rendered military service as the Free Burgher Natives, and their armed contingents were known as the \u2015Witlaps\u2016 and the \u2015Ringhals\u2016. The services were rendered firstly in consideration to secure and confirm the Tribes in free possession of the lands they then occupied, and secondly after successful conclusion of that war in 1868, for the payment of 9450 head of cattle to Commandant De Villiers acting for his Government, he agreed to the enlargement of the lands occupied by the Tribes. He, De Villiers actually promised them that the land, approximately 2130 square miles (551 667 hectares) - which the tribes were already occupying, would be secured for them. This is war talk, since in a way he was indirectly saying that this land that they were occupying could at any time be expropriated, if need be by forceful declaration and action, from them. \n\nAt least up to and according to the guarantees of the Proclamation of 1848, no land occupied by these Tribes had been encroached by any Europeans, so De Villiers appeared to be acting in good faith as based on that Proclamation. After the conclusion of the war in 1868, for the payment of 9450 cattle, it was agreed that all the land occupied mainly by two tribes, BaTlokoa and Ba-Kholokoe, who assisted Commandant De Villiers and the Boers in the war against Moshoeshoe, would then be given to them, after it has also been enlarged. There were three payments which were made for the purchase of three different areas of the land: 2450 cattle paid for the Halspruit area, made by the BaTlokoa tribe, 4000 cattle paid for the Klip Rivier area, the land situated in the Vrede and Harrismith Districts, also made by the BaTlokoa tribe, and 3000 cattle paid for the Mill River Valley in the Harrismith district, made by the Ba-Kholokoe tribe. The payments for the land of the Ba-Tlokoa tribe were made by Morena Lesisa Tsotetsi, who was representing heirs of Morena Letika and Morena Lesala, both who were the late Marena (Chiefs) of the Ba-Tlokoa tribe. He paid the combined 6450 cattle for both the Halspruit and Klip Rivier areas, which were largely occupied by the Ba-Tlokoa tribe. The Halspruit area was home to the Ba-Tlokoa tribe under the late Morena Lesala, and the Klip Rivier area was under the late Morena Letika, both of whom were now represented by Morena Lesisa. The payment for the Mill River Valley land, which covered both Thabantsu and Witsieshoek districts of the Ba-Kholokoe Tribe was made by Morena Letlatsa Moloi, who was representing heirs of the Late Morena Hlomise, son of the late Morena Oetsi (\u2015Witsie\u2016) of the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe. However, in 1888 the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe, after having received notice to leave the land, were forcibly evicted without any compensation. The struggle to regain their land had begun. \n\nChief Letlatsa Moloi of the Ba/Ma-Kholokoe Tribe became a thorn in the flesh for Captain John Quayle Dickson, the Advisor for Native Affairs in the British Colonial Orange Free State government. On the 5th of September 1903, Captain John Quayle Dickson wrote to Sir Harry Smith from his office in Bloemfontein indicating that he had visited Thabantsu (Harrismith) where he and the Regional Magistrate of the Thaba Nchu territory had personally met and informed Paramount Chief Letlasa of the Ba-Kholokoe Tribe that from then onwards he would be granted no special privileges whatsoever, and that he was now stripped of his position as one of the well-known and respected Morena oa Ba-Kholokoe, declaring him to be \u2015just another Native\u2016, and therefore from then in his opinion Paramount Chief Letlatsa will give no further trouble.

(c.1903)]]\nThe concept of a living wage, though it was not defined as such, can be traced back to the works of ancient Greek philosophers such as [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]].  Both argued for an income that considers needs, particularly those that ensure the communal good.<ref name=\":1\" />  Aristotle saw self-sufficiency as a requirement for happiness which he defined as, \u2018that which on its own makes life worthy of choice and lacking in nothing\u2019.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198240174.001.0001/acprof-9780198240174-chapter-3|chapter=Happiness and Self-Sufficiency|last=Kenny|first=Anthony|pages=23\u201342|language=en|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198240174.003.0003|title=Aristotle on the Perfect Life|year=1992|isbn=9780198240174}}</ref>  As he placed the responsibility in ensuring that the poor could earn a sustainable living in the state, his ideas are seen as an early example of support for a living wage. The evolution of the concept can be seen later on in medieval scholars such as [[Thomas Aquinas]] who argued for a 'just wage'.<ref name=\":1\" />  The concept of a just wage was related to that of [[just price]]s, which were those that allowed everyone access to necessities.  Prices and wages that prevented access to necessities were considered unjust as they would imperil the virtue of those without access.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The living wage : lessons from the history of economic thought|last=Donald.|first=Stabile|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Edward Elgar|isbn=978-1848441972|oclc=262720284}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Wealth of Nations]]'', [[Adam Smith]] recognized that rising real wages lead to the \"improvement in the circumstances of the lower ranks of people\" and are therefore an advantage to society.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">([1776] 1976). An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations.</ref> Growth and a system of liberty were the means by which the laboring poor were able to secure higher wages and an acceptable standard of living. Rising real wages are secured by growth through increasing productivity against stable price levels, i.e. prices not affected by inflation. A system of liberty, secured through political institutions whereupon even the \"lower ranks of people\" could secure the opportunity for higher wages and an acceptable standard of living.\n\n{{quotation|Servants, labourers and workmen of different kinds, make up the far greater part of every great political society.

For Smith, this equitable share amounted to more than subsistence.  Smith equated the interests of labor and the interests of land with overarching societal interests. He reasoned that as wages and rents rise, as a result of higher productivity, societal growth will occur thus increasing the quality of life for the greater part of its members.<ref name=\"Clary, B. 2009\">{{Cite journal|last1=Clary|first1=B.

It is argued that government should in turn attempt to align the interests of those pursuing profits with the interests of the labor in order to produce societal advantages for the majority of society.  Smith argued that higher productivity and overall growth led to higher wages that in turn led to greater benefits for society.  Based on his writings, one can infer that Smith would support a living wage commensurate with the overall growth of the economy. This, in turn, would lead to more happiness and joy for people, while helping to keep families and people out of poverty.  Political institutions can create a system of liberty for individuals to ensure opportunity for higher wages through higher production and thus stable growth for society.\n\nIn 1891, [[Pope Leo XIII]] issued a papal bull entitled ''[[Rerum novarum]]'', which is considered the Catholic Church's first expression of a view supportive of a living wage.  The church recognized that wages should be sufficient to [[family wage|support a family]].  This position has been widely supported by the church since that time, and has been reaffirmed by the papacy on multiple occasions, such as by [[Pope Pius XI]] in 1931 ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'' and again in 1961, by [[Pope John XXIII]] writing in the encyclical ''[[Mater et magistra]].'' More recently, [[Pope John Paul II]] wrote, \"Hence in every case a just wage is the concrete means of verifying the whole socioeconomic system and, in any case, of checking that it is functioning justly.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=4928|title=The Living Wage and Catholic Social Teaching|last=William P.|first=Quigley|date=August 28, 2006|work=[[America (Jesuit magazine)|America]]|accessdate=February 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Contemporary thought ==\n{{quote box\n| quote = Everyone who works has the right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and for his family an existence worthy of human dignity.\n| source = [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], Art. 23 Sec. 3\n| width = 250px\n}}\nDifferent ideas on a living wage have been advanced by modern campaigns that have pushed for localities to adopt them. Supporters of a living wage have argued that a wage is more than just compensation for labour.  It is a means of securing a living and it leads to public policies that address both the level of the wage and its decency.<ref name=\"Clary, B. 2009\" /> Contemporary research by Andrea Werner and Ming Lim has analyzed the works of [[John A. Ryan|John Ryan]], Jerold Waltman and Donald Stabile for their philosophical and ethical insights on a living wage.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nJohn Ryan argues for a living wage from a rights perspective.  He considers a living wage to be a right that all labourers are entitled to from the 'common bounty of nature'.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=A living wage: Its ethical and economic aspects.|last=Ryan|first=John|publisher=MacMillan.|year=1912|isbn=978-1532703553|location=London|pages=27, 43, 46}}</ref>  He argues that private ownership of resources precludes access to them by others who would need them to maintain themselves.  As such, the obligation to fulfill the right of a living wage rests on the owners and employers of private resources.  His argument goes beyond that a wage should provide mere subsistence but that it should provide humans with the capabilities to 'develop within reasonable limits all [their] faculties, physical, intellectual, moral and spiritual.'<ref name=\":2\" /> A living wage for him is 'the amount of remuneration that is sufficient to maintain decently the laborer'''.''<ref>Werner, A. and Lim, M., 2016. The ethics of the living wage: A review and research agenda. Journal of Business Ethics, 137(3), pp.433-447.</ref>\n\nJerold Waltman, in ''A Case for the Living Wage,'' argues for a living wage not based on individual rights but from a communal, or '[[Classical republicanism|civic republicanism]]', perspective.  He sees the need for citizens to be connected to their community, and thus, sees individual and communal interests as inseparably bound.  Two major problems that are antithetical to [[Classical republicanism|civic republicanism]] are poverty and inequality.  A living wage is meant to address these by providing the material basis that allows individuals a degree of autonomy and prevents disproportionate income and wealth that would inevitably lead to a societal fissure between the rich and poor.  A living wage further allows for political participation by all classes of people which is required to prevent the political interests of the rich from undermining the needs of the poor.  These arguments for a living wage, taken together, can be seen as necessary elements for 'social sustainability and cohesion'.<ref name=\":1\" />\n[[File:Waiting for a Living Wage Poster Catherine Courtauld 1913.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Waiting for a living wage poster (1913)]]\nDonald Stabile argues for a living wage based on [[Moral economy|moral economic thought]] and its related themes of sustainability, capability and [[externality]]. Broadly speaking, Stabile indicates that sustainability in the economy may require that people have the means for 'decent accommodation, transport, clothing and personal care'.<ref name=\":1\" />  He qualifies the statement as he sees individual necessities as contextual and therefore able to change over time, between cultures and under different macroeconomic circumstances.<ref name=\":1\" />  This suggests that the concept and definition of a living wage cannot be made objective over all places and in all times. Stabile's thoughts on capabilities make direct reference to [[Amartya Sen]]'s work on [[capability approach]].<ref name=\":1\" />  The tie-in with a living wage is the idea that income is an important, though not exclusive, means for capabilities.  The enhancement of people's capabilities allows them to better function both in society and as workers. These capabilities are further passed down from parents to children. Finally, Stabile analyses the lack of a living wage as the imposition of [[Externality#Negative|negative externalities]] on others.  These externalities take the form of depleting the stock of workers by 'exploiting and exhausting the workforce'.<ref name=\":1\" />  This leads to economic inefficiency as businesses end up overproducing their products due to not paying the full cost of labour.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nOther contemporary accounts have taken up the theme of [[Externality|externalities]] arising due to a lack of living wage.  Muilenburg and Singh see welfare programs, such as housing and school meals, as being a subsidy for employers that allow them to pay low wages.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Muilenburg|first=Kamal|last2=Singh|first2=Gangaram|date=2007-01-01|title=The Modern Living Wage Movement|journal=Compensation & Benefits Review|language=en|volume=39|issue=1|pages=21\u201328|doi=10.1177/0886368706297430|issn=0886-3687}}</ref>  This subsidy, taking the form of an externality, is of course paid for by society in the form of taxes. This thought is repeated by Grimshaw who argues that employers offset the social costs of maintaining their workforce through tax credits, housing, benefits and other wage subsidies.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Living wage movements: Global perspectives|last=Grimshaw|first=D.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=|location=London|pages=101\u2013121}}</ref>  The issue was raised during the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|Democratic party primary election of 2016]] in the United States, when presidential candidate [[Bernie Sanders]] mentioned that \"struggling working families should not have to subsidise the wealthiest family in the country\", and therefore, implied that the large retailer [[Walmart]], who is owned by the wealthiest family in the country, was not paying fair wages and was being subsidised by taxpayers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-wal-mart-wages-nowhere-near-enough|title=Sanders: Wal-Mart Wages 'Nowhere Near Enough'|website=Sen.

(2017)]]\nThe Living Wage Campaign in the United Kingdom originated in London, where it was launched in 2001 by members of the community organisation London Citizens (now [[Citizens UK]]). It engaged in a series of Living Wage campaigns and in 2005 the [[Greater London Authority]] established the Living Wage Unit to calculate the London Living Wage, although the authority had no power to enforce it. The London Living Wage was developed in 2008 when Trust for London awarded a grant of over \u00a31 million for campaigning, research and an employer accreditation scheme. The Living Wage campaign subsequently grew into a national movement with local campaigns across the UK. The [[Joseph Rowntree Foundation]] funded the [[Centre for Research in Social Policy]] (CRSP) at [[Loughborough University]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/research/crsp/mis/thelivingwage/|title=The Living Wage|work=Loughborough University:Centre for Research in Social Policy}}</ref> to calculate a UK-wide Minimum Income Standard (MIS) figure, an average across the whole of the UK independent of the higher living costs in London.\n\nIn 2011 the CRSP used the MIS as the basis for developing a standard model for setting the UK Living Wage outside of London. [[Citizens UK]], a nationwide community organising institution developed out of London Citizens, launched the [[Living Wage Foundation]] and Living Wage Employer mark.<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.livingwage.org.uk/history|publisher=Living Wage Foundation|accessdate=12 April 2016}}</ref> Since 2011, the Living Wage Foundation has accredited thousands of employers that pay its proposed living wage.

According to a survey of labor economists by the Employment Policies Institute in 2000, only 31% viewed living wages as a very or somewhat effective anti-poverty tool, while 98% viewed policies like the US earned income tax credit and general welfare grants in a similar vein.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.epionline.org/studies/r13/|title=The Living Wage: Survey of Labor Economists|author=|date=|work=Employment Policies Institute|accessdate=5 November 2015}}</ref> On the other hand, according to Zagros Madjd-Sadjadi, an economist with the State of California's Division of Labor Statistics and Research, the living wage may be seen by the public as preferable to other methods because it reinforces the \"work ethic\" and ensures that there is something of value produced, unlike welfare, that is often believed to be a pure cash \"gift\" from the public coffers.\"<ref>Madjd-Sadjadi, Zagros (2001), ''Living Wages: The Issues and the Impact'' Division of Labor Statistics and Research, California Department of Industrial Relations, San Francisco, California, p. 10</ref>\n\nThe concept of a living wage based on its definition as a family wage has been criticized by some for emphasizing the role of men as breadwinners.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n<br /><!-- However, occupations that would most benefit from a living wage, including cleaning, catering, childcare, care for the elderly and the sick, and routine office jobs, are disproportionately affected by low pay and disproportionately staffed by women.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Living wage movements: Global perspectives|last=Figart|first=Deborah M.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=|location=London|pages=1\u201312}}</ref>-->\n\n==See also==\n* [[Distributism]]\n*[[Family wage]]\n* [[Guaranteed minimum income]]\n* [[Labor market]]\n* [[Maximum wage]]\n* [[Minimum wage]]\n* [[Positive rights]]\n* [[Precarious work]]\n* [[Supply and demand]]\n* [[Trade Boards Act 1909]]\n* [[Working poor]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* S Webb and B Webb, ''[[Industrial Democracy]]'' (Longmans 1902)\n* [[John A.

Both argued for an income that considers needs, particularly those that ensure the communal good.<ref name=\":1\" />  Aristotle saw self-sufficiency as a requirement for happiness which he defined as, \u2018that which on its own makes life worthy of choice and lacking in nothing\u2019.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198240174.001.0001/acprof-9780198240174-chapter-3|chapter=Happiness and Self-Sufficiency|last=Kenny|first=Anthony|pages=23\u201342|language=en|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198240174.003.0003|title=Aristotle on the Perfect Life|year=1992|isbn=9780198240174}}</ref>  As he placed the responsibility in ensuring that the poor could earn a sustainable living in the state, his ideas are seen as an early example of support for a living wage. The evolution of the concept can be seen later on in medieval scholars such as [[Thomas Aquinas]] who argued for a 'just wage'.<ref name=\":1\" />  The concept of a just wage was related to that of [[just price]]s, which were those that allowed everyone access to necessities.  Prices and wages that prevented access to necessities were considered unjust as they would imperil the virtue of those without access.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The living wage : lessons from the history of economic thought|last=Donald.|first=Stabile|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Edward Elgar|isbn=978-1848441972|oclc=262720284}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Wealth of Nations]]'', [[Adam Smith]] recognized that rising real wages lead to the \"improvement in the circumstances of the lower ranks of people\" and are therefore an advantage to society.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">([1776] 1976). An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations.</ref> Growth and a system of liberty were the means by which the laboring poor were able to secure higher wages and an acceptable standard of living. Rising real wages are secured by growth through increasing productivity against stable price levels, i.e. prices not affected by inflation.

For Smith, this equitable share amounted to more than subsistence.  Smith equated the interests of labor and the interests of land with overarching societal interests.

It is argued that government should in turn attempt to align the interests of those pursuing profits with the interests of the labor in order to produce societal advantages for the majority of society.  Smith argued that higher productivity and overall growth led to higher wages that in turn led to greater benefits for society.  Based on his writings, one can infer that Smith would support a living wage commensurate with the overall growth of the economy. This, in turn, would lead to more happiness and joy for people, while helping to keep families and people out of poverty.  Political institutions can create a system of liberty for individuals to ensure opportunity for higher wages through higher production and thus stable growth for society.\n\nIn 1891, [[Pope Leo XIII]] issued a papal bull entitled ''[[Rerum novarum]]'', which is considered the Catholic Church's first expression of a view supportive of a living wage.  The church recognized that wages should be sufficient to [[family wage|support a family]].  This position has been widely supported by the church since that time, and has been reaffirmed by the papacy on multiple occasions, such as by [[Pope Pius XI]] in 1931 ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'' and again in 1961, by [[Pope John XXIII]] writing in the encyclical ''[[Mater et magistra]].'' More recently, [[Pope John Paul II]] wrote, \"Hence in every case a just wage is the concrete means of verifying the whole socioeconomic system and, in any case, of checking that it is functioning justly.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=4928|title=The Living Wage and Catholic Social Teaching|last=William P.|first=Quigley|date=August 28, 2006|work=[[America (Jesuit magazine)|America]]|accessdate=February 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Contemporary thought ==\n{{quote box\n| quote = Everyone who works has the right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and for his family an existence worthy of human dignity.\n| source = [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], Art. 23 Sec. 3\n| width = 250px\n}}\nDifferent ideas on a living wage have been advanced by modern campaigns that have pushed for localities to adopt them. Supporters of a living wage have argued that a wage is more than just compensation for labour.  It is a means of securing a living and it leads to public policies that address both the level of the wage and its decency.<ref name=\"Clary, B. 2009\" /> Contemporary research by Andrea Werner and Ming Lim has analyzed the works of [[John A. Ryan|John Ryan]], Jerold Waltman and Donald Stabile for their philosophical and ethical insights on a living wage.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nJohn Ryan argues for a living wage from a rights perspective.  He considers a living wage to be a right that all labourers are entitled to from the 'common bounty of nature'.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=A living wage: Its ethical and economic aspects.|last=Ryan|first=John|publisher=MacMillan.|year=1912|isbn=978-1532703553|location=London|pages=27, 43, 46}}</ref>  He argues that private ownership of resources precludes access to them by others who would need them to maintain themselves.  As such, the obligation to fulfill the right of a living wage rests on the owners and employers of private resources.  His argument goes beyond that a wage should provide mere subsistence but that it should provide humans with the capabilities to 'develop within reasonable limits all [their] faculties, physical, intellectual, moral and spiritual.'<ref name=\":2\" /> A living wage for him is 'the amount of remuneration that is sufficient to maintain decently the laborer'''.''<ref>Werner, A. and Lim, M., 2016. The ethics of the living wage: A review and research agenda. Journal of Business Ethics, 137(3), pp.433-447.</ref>\n\nJerold Waltman, in ''A Case for the Living Wage,'' argues for a living wage not based on individual rights but from a communal, or '[[Classical republicanism|civic republicanism]]', perspective.  He sees the need for citizens to be connected to their community, and thus, sees individual and communal interests as inseparably bound.  Two major problems that are antithetical to [[Classical republicanism|civic republicanism]] are poverty and inequality.  A living wage is meant to address these by providing the material basis that allows individuals a degree of autonomy and prevents disproportionate income and wealth that would inevitably lead to a societal fissure between the rich and poor.  A living wage further allows for political participation by all classes of people which is required to prevent the political interests of the rich from undermining the needs of the poor.  These arguments for a living wage, taken together, can be seen as necessary elements for 'social sustainability and cohesion'.<ref name=\":1\" />\n[[File:Waiting for a Living Wage Poster Catherine Courtauld 1913.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Waiting for a living wage poster (1913)]]\nDonald Stabile argues for a living wage based on [[Moral economy|moral economic thought]] and its related themes of sustainability, capability and [[externality]]. Broadly speaking, Stabile indicates that sustainability in the economy may require that people have the means for 'decent accommodation, transport, clothing and personal care'.<ref name=\":1\" />  He qualifies the statement as he sees individual necessities as contextual and therefore able to change over time, between cultures and under different macroeconomic circumstances.<ref name=\":1\" />  This suggests that the concept and definition of a living wage cannot be made objective over all places and in all times. Stabile's thoughts on capabilities make direct reference to [[Amartya Sen]]'s work on [[capability approach]].<ref name=\":1\" />  The tie-in with a living wage is the idea that income is an important, though not exclusive, means for capabilities.  The enhancement of people's capabilities allows them to better function both in society and as workers. These capabilities are further passed down from parents to children. Finally, Stabile analyses the lack of a living wage as the imposition of [[Externality#Negative|negative externalities]] on others.  These externalities take the form of depleting the stock of workers by 'exploiting and exhausting the workforce'.<ref name=\":1\" />  This leads to economic inefficiency as businesses end up overproducing their products due to not paying the full cost of labour.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nOther contemporary accounts have taken up the theme of [[Externality|externalities]] arising due to a lack of living wage.  Muilenburg and Singh see welfare programs, such as housing and school meals, as being a subsidy for employers that allow them to pay low wages.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Muilenburg|first=Kamal|last2=Singh|first2=Gangaram|date=2007-01-01|title=The Modern Living Wage Movement|journal=Compensation & Benefits Review|language=en|volume=39|issue=1|pages=21\u201328|doi=10.1177/0886368706297430|issn=0886-3687}}</ref>  This subsidy, taking the form of an externality, is of course paid for by society in the form of taxes. This thought is repeated by Grimshaw who argues that employers offset the social costs of maintaining their workforce through tax credits, housing, benefits and other wage subsidies.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Living wage movements: Global perspectives|last=Grimshaw|first=D.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=|location=London|pages=101\u2013121}}</ref>  The issue was raised during the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|Democratic party primary election of 2016]] in the United States, when presidential candidate [[Bernie Sanders]] mentioned that \"struggling working families should not have to subsidise the wealthiest family in the country\", and therefore, implied that the large retailer [[Walmart]], who is owned by the wealthiest family in the country, was not paying fair wages and was being subsidised by taxpayers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sanders-wal-mart-wages-nowhere-near-enough|title=Sanders: Wal-Mart Wages 'Nowhere Near Enough'|website=Sen.

National [[minimum wage law]] began with the [[Trade Boards Act 1909]], and the [[Wages Councils Act 1945]] set minimum wage standards in many sectors of the economy. Wages Councils were abolished in 1993 and subsequently replaced with a single statutory national [[minimum wage]] by the [[National Minimum Wage Act 1998]], which is still in force. The rates are reviewed each year by the country's [[Low Pay Commission]]. From 1 April 2016 the minimum wage has been paid as a mandatory [[National Living Wage]] for workers over 25. It is being phased in between 2016 and 2020 and is set at a significantly higher level than previous minimum wage rates. By 2020 it is expected to have risen to at least \u00a39 per hour and represent a full-time annual pay equivalent to 60% of the median UK earnings.<ref name=\"Guardian-Live\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2015/jul/08/budget-2015-live#block-559d1f1be4b032a39a3bb3d5|title=Budget 2015 live: George Osborne announces 'living wage' of \u00a39 an hour|author=Andrew Sparrow and Nick Fletcher|date=8 July 2015|accessdate=8 July 2015}}</ref> The National Living Wage is nevertheless lower than the value of the Living Wage calculated by the [[Living Wage Foundation]].<ref>{{cite news|title=George Osborne's 'living wage' is not actually a living wage, says Living Wage Foundation|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/george-osborne-s-living-wage-is-not-actually-a-living-wage-says-living-wage-foundation-10375897.html|date=8 July 2015|author=Jon Stone|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=12 April 2016}}</ref> Some organisations voluntarily pay a living wage to their staff, at a level somewhat higher than the statutory level.

It engaged in a series of Living Wage campaigns and in 2005 the [[Greater London Authority]] established the Living Wage Unit to calculate the London Living Wage, although the authority had no power to enforce it. The London Living Wage was developed in 2008 when Trust for London awarded a grant of over \u00a31 million for campaigning, research and an employer accreditation scheme. The Living Wage campaign subsequently grew into a national movement with local campaigns across the UK. The [[Joseph Rowntree Foundation]] funded the [[Centre for Research in Social Policy]] (CRSP) at [[Loughborough University]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/research/crsp/mis/thelivingwage/|title=The Living Wage|work=Loughborough University:Centre for Research in Social Policy}}</ref> to calculate a UK-wide Minimum Income Standard (MIS) figure, an average across the whole of the UK independent of the higher living costs in London.\n\nIn 2011 the CRSP used the MIS as the basis for developing a standard model for setting the UK Living Wage outside of London.

Economically, both can be analyzed as a [[price floor]] for labor.  A [[price floor]], if above the [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium price]] and thus effective, necessarily leads to a \"surplus\".  In the context of a [[Labour economics|labor market]], this means that unemployment goes up as the number of employers willing to hire people at a \"living wage\" is below the number they would be willing to hire at the equilibrium wage price.  As such, setting the minimum wage at a living wage has been criticized for possibly destroying jobs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iea.org.uk/blog/living-wage-likely-to-destroy-jobs-and-increase-poverty|title=Living Wage likely to destroy jobs and increase poverty|date=11 September 2012|publisher=Institute of Economic Affairs|author=Len Shackleton|accessdate=5 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21565994-sense-and-nonsense-about-minimum-wages-wage-flaws|title=Wage flaws|date=November 10, 2012|work=The Economist}}</ref> For more information, see [[price floor]].\n\n\nOther concerns regarding a living wage implementation mainly question whether it can decrease job opportunities for low wage workers as it cuts costs for profit seeking organizations and companies.

Authors point to living wages as being only a limited way of addressing the problems of rising [[economic inequality]], the increase of long-term low-wage jobs, and a decline of [[Trade union|unions]] and legal protection for workers.<ref name=\":1\" /> Since living wage ordinances attempt to address the issue of a living wage, defined by some of its proponents as a ''family'' wage, rather than as an ''individual'' wage, many of the beneficiaries may already be in families that make substantially more than that necessary to provide an adequate standard of living. According to a survey of labor economists by the Employment Policies Institute in 2000, only 31% viewed living wages as a very or somewhat effective anti-poverty tool, while 98% viewed policies like the US earned income tax credit and general welfare grants in a similar vein.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.epionline.org/studies/r13/|title=The Living Wage: Survey of Labor Economists|author=|date=|work=Employment Policies Institute|accessdate=5 November 2015}}</ref> On the other hand, according to Zagros Madjd-Sadjadi, an economist with the State of California's Division of Labor Statistics and Research, the living wage may be seen by the public as preferable to other methods because it reinforces the \"work ethic\" and ensures that there is something of value produced, unlike welfare, that is often believed to be a pure cash \"gift\" from the public coffers.\"<ref>Madjd-Sadjadi, Zagros (2001), ''Living Wages: The Issues and the Impact'' Division of Labor Statistics and Research, California Department of Industrial Relations, San Francisco, California, p. 10</ref>\n\nThe concept of a living wage based on its definition as a family wage has been criticized by some for emphasizing the role of men as breadwinners.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n<br /><!-- However, occupations that would most benefit from a living wage, including cleaning, catering, childcare, care for the elderly and the sick, and routine office jobs, are disproportionately affected by low pay and disproportionately staffed by women.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Living wage movements: Global perspectives|last=Figart|first=Deborah M.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=|location=London|pages=1\u201312}}</ref>-->\n\n==See also==\n* [[Distributism]]\n*[[Family wage]]\n* [[Guaranteed minimum income]]\n* [[Labor market]]\n* [[Maximum wage]]\n* [[Minimum wage]]\n* [[Positive rights]]\n* [[Precarious work]]\n* [[Supply and demand]]\n* [[Trade Boards Act 1909]]\n* [[Working poor]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* S Webb and B Webb, ''[[Industrial Democracy]]'' (Longmans 1902)\n* [[John A.
