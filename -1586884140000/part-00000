For example, in 1902, the U.S. publication  ''[[Munsey's Magazine]]'' said of the wife of [[Governor General of Canada|Canadian Governor General]] [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 4th Earl of Minto|the Earl of Minto]]: \"As the first lady in the land, she has done much to weld together the heterogeneous components of a colonial society which includes peoples of different races and of antagonistic religions.\"<ref>\"In The Public Eye: The Governor-General of Canada\", p.&nbsp;684. http://www.unz.org/Pub/Munseys-1902feb-00681</ref> The term was also used by ''Munsey's'' to refer to the wife of Mexico's leader, President Porfirio D\u00edaz: In an 1896 piece about \"The Daughters of Mexico\", author Jeannie Marshall said of Carmen Romero Rubio de D\u00edaz: \"She is still a young woman, though she has filled the position of 'first lady of the land' for many years, with marked success.\"<ref>Jeannie A.

Many early first ladies expressed their own preference for how they were addressed, including the use of such titles as ''Lady''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} One of the earliest uses of the term \"first lady\" was applied to Martha Washington in a profile by Mrs. C. H. Sigourney in 1838: Mrs. Sigourney, discussing how Martha Washington had not changed, even after her husband [[George Washington|George]] became president, wrote that \"The first lady of the nation still preserved the habits of early life. Indulging in no indolence, she left the pillow at dawn, and after breakfast, retired to her chamber for an hour for the study of the scriptures and devotion\".<ref name=\"auto\"/> However, the term \"first lady\" would not come into common use until the late 1800s.\n\n[[Harriet Lane]], niece of bachelor president [[James Buchanan]], was the first woman to be called ''first lady'' while actually serving in that position. The phrase appeared in Frank Leslie's Illustrated Monthly in 1860, when he wrote, \"The Lady of the White House, and by courtesy, the First Lady of the Land.\" Once Harriet Lane was called ''first lady'', the term was applied retrospectively to her predecessors.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe title first gained nationwide recognition in 1877, when [[Mary C. Ames]] wrote an article in the New York City newspaper ''The Independent'' describing the [[Inauguration of Rutherford B. Hayes|inauguration]] of President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]].

For example, in 1902, the U.S. publication  ''[[Munsey's Magazine]]'' said of the wife of [[Governor General of Canada|Canadian Governor General]] [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 4th Earl of Minto|the Earl of Minto]]: \"As the first lady in the land, she has done much to weld together the heterogeneous components of a colonial society which includes peoples of different races and of antagonistic religions.\"<ref>\"In The Public Eye: The Governor-General of Canada\", p.&nbsp;684. http://www.unz.org/Pub/Munseys-1902feb-00681</ref> The term was also used by ''Munsey's'' to refer to the wife of Mexico's leader, President Porfirio D\u00edaz: In an 1896 piece about \"The Daughters of Mexico\", author Jeannie Marshall said of Carmen Romero Rubio de D\u00edaz: \"She is still a young woman, though she has filled the position of 'first lady of the land' for many years, with marked success.\"<ref>Jeannie A.

Many early first ladies expressed their own preference for how they were addressed, including the use of such titles as ''Lady''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} One of the earliest uses of the term \"first lady\" was applied to Martha Washington in a profile by Mrs. C. H. Sigourney in 1838: Mrs. Sigourney, discussing how Martha Washington had not changed, even after her husband [[George Washington|George]] became president, wrote that \"The first lady of the nation still preserved the habits of early life. Indulging in no indolence, she left the pillow at dawn, and after breakfast, retired to her chamber for an hour for the study of the scriptures and devotion\".<ref name=\"auto\"/> However, the term \"first lady\" would not come into common use until the late 1800s.\n\n[[Harriet Lane]], niece of bachelor president [[James Buchanan]], was the first woman to be called ''first lady'' while actually serving in that position. The phrase appeared in Frank Leslie's Illustrated Monthly in 1860, when he wrote, \"The Lady of the White House, and by courtesy, the First Lady of the Land.\" Once Harriet Lane was called ''first lady'', the term was applied retrospectively to her predecessors.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe title first gained nationwide recognition in 1877, when [[Mary C. Ames]] wrote an article in the New York City newspaper ''The Independent'' describing the [[Inauguration of Rutherford B. Hayes|inauguration]] of President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]].  She used the term to describe his wife, [[Lucy Webb Hayes]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nWhile historically the term has generally been used to refer to the wife of a president, there were occasions when another woman, such as the president's daughter, has filled the duties of first lady as hostess in the [[White House]], if the president's wife was unwilling, unable, or if the president was a [[widower]] or [[bachelor]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n{{As of|2020}}, the first lady of the United States is [[Melania Trump]], wife of [[Donald Trump]].\n\nThe entire family of the head of state may be known familiarly as the \"[[First Family]]\".<ref>{{cite web|work=[[dictionary.com]]|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/First%20Family|title=First Family&nbsp;\u2014 Definitions from Dictionary.com|accessdate=2007-07-19|quote=2.

This includes terms like \"First Family\", \"First Daughter\", and \"First Son\".{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nIn the past, occasionally another woman, such as the president's daughter, has filled the duties of first lady as hostess in the [[White House]], if the president's wife was unwilling, unable, or if the president was a widower or bachelor. [[Harriet Lane]], niece of bachelor president [[James Buchanan]] was the first non-spouse to be called First Lady.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nSouth Korean president [[Park Geun-hye]] has been referred to as First Lady to former president [[Park Chung-hee]], who is her father.

Victoria's mother, Alicia Quirino ''n\u00e9e'' Syqu\u00eda, had been killed by [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|occupying Japanese troops]] towards the end of the [[Second World War]]. While President [[Corazon Aquino|Coraz\u00f3n Aquino]] (1986\u201392) was also widowed, the title was not given to her older children who would assist her in official duties. These included her son (and later president) [[Benigno Aquino III]], who was a sort of ''de facto'' first gentleman; his four sisters, as under their mother's presidency, now unofficially share the duties of the first spouse. The current president, [[Rodrigo Duterte]]'s marriage was annulled, and his common-law wife is not qualified to take the title as they are not married yet. Instead, he named his daughter, [[Mayor of Davao City|Davao City Mayor]] [[Sara Duterte]], as first lady.\n\nIn 1994, Peruvian president [[Alberto Fujimori]] officially named his daughter [[Keiko Fujimori|Keiko]] \"First Lady\", after he had separated from his wife [[Susana Higuchi]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nAfter taking office as [[Puerto Rico]]'s first female governor, Governor [[Sila Maria Calder\u00f3n]] appointed her two daughters,  [[Sila Mar\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez Calder\u00f3n]] and [[Mar\u00eda Elena Gonz\u00e1lez Calder\u00f3n]], to serve as first ladies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fvillarinni.tripod.com/silamcalderon/|title=Sila M.

Ferguson regarded him as extraordinarily brilliant, having perhaps the greatest talent of any British composer in his generation, though lacking in a personal style. During this time, Bennett attended some of the [[Darmstadt]] summer courses in 1955, where he was exposed to [[serialism]]. He later spent two years in [[Paris]] as a student of the prominent serialist [[Pierre Boulez]] between 1957 and 1959.<ref>Robert Ponsonby [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/sir-richard-rodney-bennett-composer-whose-work-encompassed-serialism-tonality-and-popular-music-8431646.html \"Sir Richard Rodney Bennett: Composer whose work encompassed serialism, tonality and popular music\",] ''The Independent'', 26 December 2012</ref> He always used both his first names after finding another Richard Bennett active in music.\n\nBennett taught at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] between 1963 and 1965, at the [[Peabody Institute]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], United States from 1970 to 1971, and was later International [[Chair]] of Composition at the Royal Academy of Music between 1994 and the year 2000.

He was also a writer and performer of [[jazz]] songs for 50 years. Immersed in the techniques of the European [[avant-garde]] via his contact with Boulez, Bennett subsequently developed his own dramato-abstract style. In his later years, he adopted an increasingly tonal idiom.\n\nBennett regularly performed as a jazz pianist, with such singers as [[Cleo Laine]], [[Marion Montgomery]] (until her death in 2002), [[Mary Cleere Haran]] (until her death in 2011), and more recently with [[Claire Martin (singer)|Claire Martin]],<ref name=\"Sweeting\"/> performing the [[Great American Songbook]]. Bennett and Martin performed at such venues as The Oak Room at the [[Algonquin Hotel]] in New York, and [[The Pheasantry]] and [[Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club]] in London.\n\nIn later years, in addition to his musical activities, Bennett became known as an artist working in the medium of collage.<ref name=\"Wroe\">{{cite web|author=Nicholas Wroe |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/jul/22/richard-rodney-bennett-life-music-film |title=A life in music: Richard Rodney Bennett &#124; Music |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=2014-05-15}}</ref> He exhibited these collages several times in England, including at the [http://www.holtfestival.org/ Holt Festival, Norfolk]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://holtfestival.org/2011/fine_art.html |title=Holt Festival 2011 &#124; Fine Art |publisher=Holtfestival.org |accessdate=2014-05-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922184428/http://holtfestival.org/2011/fine_art.html |archivedate=22 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> in 2011, and at the Swaledale Festival, Yorkshire, in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swaledale-festival.org.uk/exhib |title=music, poetry, visual arts, walks, exhibitions, workshops |publisher=Swaledale Festival |accessdate=2014-05-15}}</ref> The first ever exhibition of his collages was in London in 2010, at the South Kensington and Chelsea Mental Health Centre, curated by the Nightingale Project, a charity that takes music and art into hospitals.

He wrote in a wide range of styles, including [[jazz]], for which he had a particular fondness. Early on, he began to write music for feature films. He said that it was as if the different styles of music that he was writing went on 'in different rooms, albeit in the same house'.<ref name=\"Wroe\"/> Later in his career the different aspects all became equally celebrated&nbsp;\u2013 for example in his 75th birthday year (2011), there were numerous concerts featuring all the different strands of his work. At the BBC Proms for example his ''Murder on the Orient Express Suite'' was performed in a concert of film music, and in the same season his ''Dream Dancing'' and ''[[Jazz Calendar]]'' were also featured. Also at the [[Wigmore Hall]], London, on 23 March 2011 (a few days before Bennett's 75th birthday), a double concert took place in which his [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]-inspired piece ''Sonata After Syrinx'' was performed in the first concert, and in the Late Night Jazz Event which followed, Bennett and Claire Martin performed his arrangements of the Great American Songbook (Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Rodgers and Hart and so on).

His scores for ''[[Far from the Madding Crowd (1967 film)|Far from the Madding Crowd]]'' (1967), ''[[Nicholas and Alexandra]]'' (1971), and ''[[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|Murder on the Orient Express]]'' (1974), each earned him [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, with ''Murder on the Orient Express'' gaining a [[BAFTA]] award. Later works include ''[[Enchanted April (1992 film)|Enchanted April]]'' (1992), ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'' (1994), and ''[[The Tale of Sweeney Todd]]'' (1998). He was also a prolific composer of orchestral works, piano solos, choral works and operas.

Ferguson regarded him as extraordinarily brilliant, having perhaps the greatest talent of any British composer in his generation, though lacking in a personal style. During this time, Bennett attended some of the [[Darmstadt]] summer courses in 1955, where he was exposed to [[serialism]]. He later spent two years in [[Paris]] as a student of the prominent serialist [[Pierre Boulez]] between 1957 and 1959.<ref>Robert Ponsonby [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/sir-richard-rodney-bennett-composer-whose-work-encompassed-serialism-tonality-and-popular-music-8431646.html \"Sir Richard Rodney Bennett: Composer whose work encompassed serialism, tonality and popular music\",] ''The Independent'', 26 December 2012</ref> He always used both his first names after finding another Richard Bennett active in music.\n\nBennett taught at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] between 1963 and 1965, at the [[Peabody Institute]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], United States from 1970 to 1971, and was later International [[Chair]] of Composition at the Royal Academy of Music between 1994 and the year 2000.

He was also a writer and performer of [[jazz]] songs for 50 years. Immersed in the techniques of the European [[avant-garde]] via his contact with Boulez, Bennett subsequently developed his own dramato-abstract style. In his later years, he adopted an increasingly tonal idiom.\n\nBennett regularly performed as a jazz pianist, with such singers as [[Cleo Laine]], [[Marion Montgomery]] (until her death in 2002), [[Mary Cleere Haran]] (until her death in 2011), and more recently with [[Claire Martin (singer)|Claire Martin]],<ref name=\"Sweeting\"/> performing the [[Great American Songbook]].

He wrote in a wide range of styles, including [[jazz]], for which he had a particular fondness. Early on, he began to write music for feature films. He said that it was as if the different styles of music that he was writing went on 'in different rooms, albeit in the same house'.<ref name=\"Wroe\"/> Later in his career the different aspects all became equally celebrated&nbsp;\u2013 for example in his 75th birthday year (2011), there were numerous concerts featuring all the different strands of his work. At the BBC Proms for example his ''Murder on the Orient Express Suite'' was performed in a concert of film music, and in the same season his ''Dream Dancing'' and ''[[Jazz Calendar]]'' were also featured. Also at the [[Wigmore Hall]], London, on 23 March 2011 (a few days before Bennett's 75th birthday), a double concert took place in which his [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]-inspired piece ''Sonata After Syrinx'' was performed in the first concert, and in the Late Night Jazz Event which followed, Bennett and Claire Martin performed his arrangements of the Great American Songbook (Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Rodgers and Hart and so on).

Later works include ''[[Enchanted April (1992 film)|Enchanted April]]'' (1992), ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'' (1994), and ''[[The Tale of Sweeney Todd]]'' (1998).

Exchanges are not themselves insurers, so they do not bear risk themselves, but they do determine which insurance companies participate in the exchange. An ideal exchange promotes insurance [[Transparency (market)|transparency]] and [[accountability]], facilitates increased enrollment and delivery of [[subsidy|subsidies]], and helps spread risk to ensure that the costs associated with expensive medical treatments are shared more broadly across large groups of people, rather than spread across just a few beneficiaries. Health insurance exchanges use [[electronic data interchange]] (EDI) to transmit required information between the exchanges and carriers (trading partners), in particular the ''834'' transaction for enrollment information and the ''820'' transaction for premium payment.<ref>{{cite web |last=Scholl |first=Martin |url=http://www.hipaasuite.com/?option=com_easyblog&view=latest&Itemid=336 |title=Take advantage of the emerging market place of the Health Benefit Exchanges |date=October 16, 2014 |website=HIPAA Suite |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 24, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141124044031/http://www.hipaasuite.com/?option=com_easyblog&view=latest&Itemid=336 }}</ref>{{better source |date=February 2017 |reason=Source is a blog post; text is incomplete. }}\n\n==History==\n[[File:ACA health insurance exchanges by state.svg|thumb|300px|Health insurance exchanges by state.<ref name=KaiserExchanges>{{cite web|title=State Decisions For Creating Health Insurance Exchanges, as of May 28, 2013 - Table|url=http://kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/health-insurance-exchanges/#table |publisher=[[Kaiser Family Foundation]] |date=May 28, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=State Decisions For Creating Health Insurance Exchanges, as of May 28, 2013 - Map|url=http://kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/health-insurance-exchanges/#map |publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation |date=May 28, 2013 }}</ref>{{update inline|date=February 2014}}\n{{legend|#232|Creating state-operated exchanges}}\n{{legend|#898|Establishing state-federal partnership exchanges}}\n{{legend|#C8C8C8|Defaulting to federal exchange}}]]\n\nHealth exchanges first emerged in the private sector in the early 1980s, and they used computer networking to integrate claims management, eligibility verification, and inter-carrier payments. These became popular in some regions as a way for small and medium-sized businesses to pool their purchasing power into larger groups, reducing cost. An additional advantage was the ability of small businesses to offer a range of plans to employees, allowing them to compete with larger corporations. The largest such exchange prior to the ACA is CaliforniaChoice, established in 1996. By 2000, CaliforniaChoice's membership included 140,000 individuals from 9000 business groups.\n\nObamacare maintained the concept of health insurance exchanges as a key component of health care. President Obama stated that it should be \"a market where Americans can one-stop shop for a health care plan, compare benefits and prices, and choose the plan that's best for them, in the same way that Members of Congress and their families can. None of these plans should deny coverage on the basis of a [[preexisting condition]], and all of these plans should include an affordable basic benefit package that includes prevention, and protection against catastrophic costs. I strongly believe that Americans should have the choice of a [[public health insurance option]] operating alongside private plans.

[[Health plan]]s and [[insurance carrier]]s in a private exchange must meet certain criteria defined by the [[exchange management]]. Private exchanges combine technology and human advocacy, and include online eligibility verification and mechanisms for allowing employers who connect their employees or retirees with exchanges to offer [[subsidies]]. They are designed to help consumers find plans personalized to their specific health conditions, preferred doctor/[[hospital network]]s, and budget. These exchanges are sometimes called marketplaces or intermediaries, and work directly with insurance carriers, effectively acting as extensions of the carrier.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} The largest and most successful{{peacock term|date=September 2017}} private health care exchange is CaliforniaChoice, established by the Word & Brown General Agency in 1996.<ref>{{cite web |title=About Us |website=CaliforniaChoice |url=https://www.calchoice.com/AboutUs.aspx |access-date=September 13, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nPrivate health exchanges predate the Affordable Care Act. One example of an early health care exchange is [[International Medical Exchange]] (IMX), a company venture financed in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], by [[Standard Telephones and Cables]], a large British technology company (now [[Nortel]]), to develop the exchange concept in the U.S. using on-line technology. The product was created in the mid-1980s. IMX developed an eligibility verification system, a claims management system, and a bank-based payments administration system that would manage payments between the patient, the employer, and the insurance carrier. Like proposed exchanges today, it focused on standards of care, utilization review by a third party, private insurer participation, and cost reduction for the health care system through product simplification. The focus was on creating local or regional exchanges that offered a series of standardized health care plans that reduced the complexity and cost of acquiring or understanding health care insurance, while simplifying claims administration. The system was modeled after the standardized stock exchange and banking industry [[back office]] processes. The major difference was that IMX health care exchanges would provide their products through a national network of existing commercial banks rather than setting up a duplicate payment and administration systems network as proposed today. The IMX product rights were acquired by [[Anthem (company)|Anthem]] (then Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kentucky). The exchange product became the basis for inter-carrier claims settlement between commercial insurance carriers and Blue Cross organizations. The founders of IMX were from top management at [[Humana]], and top management of [[First Horizon National Corporation|First Tennessee National Corp]] (now First Horizon).\n\nIn overlapping markets, the co-existence of public and private exchange plans can lead to confusion when speaking of an \"exchange plan.\" In California, Anthem Blue Cross offers HMO plans through both the state-run [[Covered California]] exchange and the private CaliforniaChoice exchange, but doctor networks are not identical. Physicians advertising acceptance of Anthem Blue Cross Exchange HMOs may misinform individuals enrolled in Anthem Blue Cross Exchange HMOs through the private exchange.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Health care reform in the United States]]\n* [[Health system]]\n* [[Universal health coverage by country]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.healthcare.gov HealthCare.gov] \n* [https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43066.pdf Status of Federal Funding for State Implementation of Health Insurance Exchanges] [[Congressional Research Service]]\n* [http://www.c-spanvideo.org/videoLibrary/ C-SPAN Video Library]: [http://www.c-spanvideo.org/search/?keywords=Health+Insurance+Exchange Search Health Insurance Exchange]\n: ''See \"Clips\" tab then \"Clips Timeline\" drop-down for abstracts of edited clips from the following videos:''\n:* [http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/TheFederalH Health Care Law Exchanges] Apr 22, 2013, Jenny Gold, [[Kaiser Family Foundation#Health news and information|Kaiser Health News]] correspondent, Interview\n:* [http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/PoliticoD Report Video Issue Health Insurance Exchanges] Jul 25, 2013, Politico Pro Health Care Breakfast Briefing\n:* [http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/JulieR Update on the Health Care Law] Jul 1, 2013, [https://www.npr.org/people/2101102/julie-rovner Julie Rovner], [[NPR|National Public Radio]] health policy correspondent, Interview\n* [http://www.healthinsurance.org/state-health-insurance-exchanges/ HealthInsurance.org's] guide to U.S. state health exchanges\n* [https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44065.pdf Overview of Health Insurance Exchanges], Congressional Research Service, July 1, 2016\n* [http://cookinc.com/ Group Health Insurance] Since 1977\n\n{{PPACA |state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Healthcare reform in the United States]]\n[[Category:Health insurance marketplaces| ]]\n[[Category:CGI Group]]\n", "text_old": "{{update|date=August 2016}}\n{{Health care reform in the United States}}\nIn the [[United States]], '''health insurance marketplaces''',<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.healthcare.gov/what-is-the-health-insurance-marketplace/ |title=What is the Health Insurance Marketplace? |website=[[Healthcare.gov]] |publisher=U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services }}</ref> also called '''health exchanges''', are organizations in each state through which people can purchase [[Health insurance in the United States|health insurance]].

Exchanges are not themselves insurers, so they do not bear risk themselves, but they do determine which insurance companies participate in the exchange. An ideal exchange promotes insurance [[Transparency (market)|transparency]] and [[accountability]], facilitates increased enrollment and delivery of [[subsidy|subsidies]], and helps spread risk to ensure that the costs associated with expensive medical treatments are shared more broadly across large groups of people, rather than spread across just a few beneficiaries. Health insurance exchanges use [[electronic data interchange]] (EDI) to transmit required information between the exchanges and carriers (trading partners), in particular the ''834'' transaction for enrollment information and the ''820'' transaction for premium payment.<ref>{{cite web |last=Scholl |first=Martin |url=http://www.hipaasuite.com/?option=com_easyblog&view=latest&Itemid=336 |title=Take advantage of the emerging market place of the Health Benefit Exchanges |date=October 16, 2014 |website=HIPAA Suite |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 24, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141124044031/http://www.hipaasuite.com/?option=com_easyblog&view=latest&Itemid=336 }}</ref>{{better source |date=February 2017 |reason=Source is a blog post; text is incomplete. }}\n\n==History==\n[[File:ACA health insurance exchanges by state.svg|thumb|300px|Health insurance exchanges by state.<ref name=KaiserExchanges>{{cite web|title=State Decisions For Creating Health Insurance Exchanges, as of May 28, 2013 - Table|url=http://kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/health-insurance-exchanges/#table |publisher=[[Kaiser Family Foundation]] |date=May 28, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=State Decisions For Creating Health Insurance Exchanges, as of May 28, 2013 - Map|url=http://kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/health-insurance-exchanges/#map |publisher=Kaiser Family Foundation |date=May 28, 2013 }}</ref>{{update inline|date=February 2014}}\n{{legend|#232|Creating state-operated exchanges}}\n{{legend|#898|Establishing state-federal partnership exchanges}}\n{{legend|#C8C8C8|Defaulting to federal exchange}}]]\n\nHealth exchanges first emerged in the private sector in the early 1980s, and they used computer networking to integrate claims management, eligibility verification, and inter-carrier payments. These became popular in some regions as a way for small and medium-sized businesses to pool their purchasing power into larger groups, reducing cost. An additional advantage was the ability of small businesses to offer a range of plans to employees, allowing them to compete with larger corporations. The largest such exchange prior to the ACA is CaliforniaChoice, established in 1996. By 2000, CaliforniaChoice's membership included 140,000 individuals from 9000 business groups.\n\nObamacare maintained the concept of health insurance exchanges as a key component of health care. President Obama stated that it should be \"a market where Americans can one-stop shop for a health care plan, compare benefits and prices, and choose the plan that's best for them, in the same way that Members of Congress and their families can. None of these plans should deny coverage on the basis of a [[preexisting condition]], and all of these plans should include an affordable basic benefit package that includes prevention, and protection against catastrophic costs.

[[Health plan]]s and [[insurance carrier]]s in a private exchange must meet certain criteria defined by the [[exchange management]]. Private exchanges combine technology and human advocacy, and include online eligibility verification and mechanisms for allowing employers who connect their employees or retirees with exchanges to offer [[subsidies]]. They are designed to help consumers find plans personalized to their specific health conditions, preferred doctor/[[hospital network]]s, and budget. These exchanges are sometimes called marketplaces or intermediaries, and work directly with insurance carriers, effectively acting as extensions of the carrier.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} The largest and most successful{{peacock term|date=September 2017}} private health care exchange is CaliforniaChoice, established by the Word & Brown General Agency in 1996.<ref>{{cite web |title=About Us |website=CaliforniaChoice |url=https://www.calchoice.com/AboutUs.aspx |access-date=September 13, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nPrivate health exchanges predate the Affordable Care Act. One example of an early health care exchange is [[International Medical Exchange]] (IMX), a company venture financed in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], by [[Standard Telephones and Cables]], a large British technology company (now [[Nortel]]), to develop the exchange concept in the U.S. using on-line technology. The product was created in the mid-1980s. IMX developed an eligibility verification system, a claims management system, and a bank-based payments administration system that would manage payments between the patient, the employer, and the insurance carrier. Like proposed exchanges today, it focused on standards of care, utilization review by a third party, private insurer participation, and cost reduction for the health care system through product simplification. The focus was on creating local or regional exchanges that offered a series of standardized health care plans that reduced the complexity and cost of acquiring or understanding health care insurance, while simplifying claims administration. The system was modeled after the standardized stock exchange and banking industry [[back office]] processes. The major difference was that IMX health care exchanges would provide their products through a national network of existing commercial banks rather than setting up a duplicate payment and administration systems network as proposed today. The IMX product rights were acquired by [[Anthem (company)|Anthem]] (then Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kentucky). The exchange product became the basis for inter-carrier claims settlement between commercial insurance carriers and Blue Cross organizations. The founders of IMX were from top management at [[Humana]], and top management of [[First Horizon National Corporation|First Tennessee National Corp]] (now First Horizon).\n\nIn overlapping markets, the co-existence of public and private exchange plans can lead to confusion when speaking of an \"exchange plan.\" In California, Anthem Blue Cross offers HMO plans through both the state-run [[Covered California]] exchange and the private CaliforniaChoice exchange, but doctor networks are not identical. Physicians advertising acceptance of Anthem Blue Cross Exchange HMOs may misinform individuals enrolled in Anthem Blue Cross Exchange HMOs through the private exchange.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Health care reform in the United States]]\n* [[Health system]]\n* [[Universal health coverage by country]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.healthcare.gov HealthCare.gov] \n* [https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43066.pdf Status of Federal Funding for State Implementation of Health Insurance Exchanges] [[Congressional Research Service]]\n* [http://www.c-spanvideo.org/videoLibrary/ C-SPAN Video Library]: [http://www.c-spanvideo.org/search/?keywords=Health+Insurance+Exchange Search Health Insurance Exchange]\n: ''See \"Clips\" tab then \"Clips Timeline\" drop-down for abstracts of edited clips from the following videos:''\n:* [http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/TheFederalH Health Care Law Exchanges] Apr 22, 2013, Jenny Gold, [[Kaiser Family Foundation#Health news and information|Kaiser Health News]] correspondent, Interview\n:* [http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/PoliticoD Report Video Issue Health Insurance Exchanges] Jul 25, 2013, Politico Pro Health Care Breakfast Briefing\n:* [http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/JulieR Update on the Health Care Law] Jul 1, 2013, [https://www.npr.org/people/2101102/julie-rovner Julie Rovner], [[NPR|National Public Radio]] health policy correspondent, Interview\n* [http://www.healthinsurance.org/state-health-insurance-exchanges/ HealthInsurance.org's] guide to U.S. state health exchanges\n* [https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44065.pdf Overview of Health Insurance Exchanges], Congressional Research Service, July 1, 2016\n* [http://cookinc.com/ Group Health Insurance] Since 1977\n\n{{PPACA |state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Healthcare reform in the United States]]\n[[Category:Health insurance marketplaces| ]]\n[[Category:CGI Group]]\n", "name_user": "Mfunderburk", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added Marketplace Enrollment stat for 2020", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance_marketplace"}

Its origins date from the 12th century, based on a former [[Cluniac]] [[monastery]]. Following the [[Reformation]] in the 16th century, it became a Church of Scotland [[parish]] [[kirk]].\n\n==History==\nIt is believed that [[Saint Mirin]] (or Saint Mirren) founded a community on this site in 7th century. Some time after his death a shrine to the Saint was established, becoming a popular site of pilgrimage and veneration. The name Paisley may derive from the [[British language (Celtic)|Brythonic]] (old Welsh ) ''Passeleg'', 'basilica' (derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]]), i.e. 'major church', recalling an early, though undocumented, ecclesiastical importance.\n\nIn 1163, [[Walter fitz Alan]], the first [[High Steward of Scotland]] issued a [[charter]] for a [[priory]] to be set up on land owned by him in Paisley.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/paisley/abbey/index.html|title=Paisley Abbey Feature Page on Undiscovered Scotland|last=info@undiscoveredscotland.co.uk|first=Undiscovered Scotland|website=www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-11}}</ref> It was dedicated to SS. [[Virgin Mary|Mary]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James]], Mirin and [[Milburga]]. Around 13 monks came from the Cluniac priory at [[Much Wenlock]] in [[Shropshire]] to found the community. Paisley grew so rapidly that it was raised to the status of [[abbey]] in 1245. Monks from Paisley founded [[Crossraguel Abbey]] in [[Carrick, Scotland|Carrick, Ayrshire]], in 1244.\n\nIn 1307, [[Edward I of England]] had the abbey burned down. However, it was rebuilt later in the 14th century. [[William Wallace]], born in nearby Elderslie, is widely believed to have been educated for some time when he was a boy in the abbey.<ref>[http://www.paisleyabbey.org.uk/abbeyhistory.htm Paisley Abbey website]</ref>\n\nIn 1316, [[Marjorie Bruce]], daughter of [[Robert I of Scotland]] and wife of [[Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland|Walter Stewart]], the sixth [[High Steward of Scotland]], was out riding near the abbey. During the ride, she fell from her horse and as she was heavily pregnant at the time, she was taken to Paisley Abbey for medical care. There, [[Robert II of Scotland|King Robert II]] was born by [[caesarean section]], in a time when [[Anesthesia|anaesthesia]] wouldn't have been available.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://historyandotherthoughts.blogspot.com/2014/06/the-tragic-life-of-marjorie-bruce.html|title=The Tragic Life Of Marjorie Bruce, Princess Of Scotland|access-date=2018-04-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/women/wih10.htm|title=Women in History of Scots Descent - Marjory Bruce|website=www.electricscotland.com|access-date=2018-04-11}}</ref> She was later buried at the abbey. A [[cairn]], at the junction of Dundonald Road and Renfrew Road, approximately {{convert|1|mi|km|0|abbr=off}} to the north of the Abbey, marks the spot where she reputedly fell from her horse.\n\nIn 1491, absolution was granted by Abbot George Shaw, representing the [[Pope]] and in the presence of the relics, to [[James IV of Scotland]] and others implicated in the death of [[James III of Scotland|James III]] at the [[Battle of Sauchieburn]]. By 1499 Shaw had had built a new, larger pilgrims' chapel and added the sculptured stone frieze which can still be seen today, showing scenes from the life of St Miren. It was originally brightly painted and may have been part of a rear panel of an altar before being put up as a frieze on the wall.<ref>\"Pilgrimage in Medieval Scotland\" by Peter Yeoman, Historic Scotland 1999</ref>\n\n[[File:Paisley Abbey from the south east.jpg|thumb|640px|center|Paisley Abbey from the south west]]\nA succession of fires and the collapse of the tower in the 15th and 16th centuries left the building in a partially ruined state. Although the western section was still used for worship, the eastern section was widely plundered for its stone. From 1858 to 1928 the north [[porch]] and the eastern [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] were reconstructed on the remains of the ruined walls by the architect Macgregor Chalmers. After his death, work on the choir was completed by Sir [[Robert Lorimer]].<ref>[http://www.paisleyabbey.org.uk/abbeyhistory.htm Paisley Abbey website, ibid.]</ref>\n\n==Points of interest==\nPaisley Abbey is the burial place of all six [[House of Stuart|High Stewards]] of Scotland, [[Marjorie Bruce]] who was the mother of [[Robert II of Scotland|Robert II]] and the wives of Robert II and [[Robert III of Scotland|King Robert III]]. The [[Celt]]ic [[Barochan Cross]], once sited near the village of [[Houston, Scotland|Houston]], Renfrewshire, is now inside the abbey itself. The cross is thought to date from the 10th century. In the abbey's nave, the Wallace Memorial Window, which depicts the image of Samson, was donated in 1873.\n\n=== The Paisley Abbey Drain ===\nIn the early 1990s an ancient vaulted drain of extremely fine construction, probably 13th century in date, was rediscovered running from the abbey to the White Cart.

The organ as rebuilt by Walkers in 1968 has 4 manuals, 65 stops and 5448 pipes.(National Pipe Organ Register; \"The Organ at Paisley Abbey\", booklet pub. Paisley Abbey) In 2009 the instrument underwent a major restoration by Harrison and Harrison of Durham. The work included major cleaning and servicing, the provision of a new wind system and the addition of a 32&nbsp;ft contre bombarde. The latter was part of the 1968 scheme by Ralph Downes but not included in the work actually undertaken.\n\n=== Internal architectural details ===\nThe twelve angel corbels and stone communion table are by [[Pilkington Jackson]], sculptor of the iconic [[Robert the Bruce]] statue at [[Bannockburn]].

Its origins date from the 12th century, based on a former [[Cluniac]] [[monastery]]. Following the [[Reformation]] in the 16th century, it became a Church of Scotland [[parish]] [[kirk]].\n\n==History==\nIt is believed that [[Saint Mirin]] (or Saint Mirren) founded a community on this site in 7th century. Some time after his death a shrine to the Saint was established,  becoming a popular site of pilgrimage and veneration. The name Paisley may derive from the [[British language (Celtic)|Brythonic]] (old Welsh ) ''Passeleg'', 'basilica' (derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]]), i.e. 'major church', recalling an early, though undocumented, ecclesiastical importance.\n\nIn 1163, [[Walter fitz Alan]], the first [[High Steward of Scotland]] issued a [[charter]] for a [[priory]] to be set up on land owned by him in Paisley.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/paisley/abbey/index.html|title=Paisley Abbey Feature Page on Undiscovered Scotland|last=info@undiscoveredscotland.co.uk|first=Undiscovered Scotland|website=www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-11}}</ref> It was dedicated to SS. [[Virgin Mary|Mary]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James]], Mirin and [[Milburga]]. Around 13 monks came from the Cluniac priory at [[Much Wenlock]] in [[Shropshire]] to found the community. Paisley grew so rapidly that it was raised to the status of [[abbey]] in 1245.  Monks from Paisley founded [[Crossraguel Abbey]] in [[Carrick, Scotland|Carrick, Ayrshire]], in 1244.\n\nIn 1307, [[Edward I of England]] had the abbey burned down. However, it was rebuilt later in the 14th century. [[William Wallace]], born in nearby Elderslie, is widely believed to have been educated for some time when he was a boy in the abbey.<ref>[http://www.paisleyabbey.org.uk/abbeyhistory.htm Paisley Abbey website]</ref>\n\nIn 1316, [[Marjorie Bruce]], daughter of [[Robert I of Scotland]] and wife of [[Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland|Walter Stewart]], the sixth [[High Steward of Scotland]], was out riding near the abbey. During the ride, she fell from her horse and as she was heavily pregnant at the time, she was taken to Paisley Abbey for medical care. There, [[Robert II of Scotland|King Robert II]] was born by [[caesarean section]], in a time when [[Anesthesia|anaesthesia]] wouldn't have been available.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://historyandotherthoughts.blogspot.com/2014/06/the-tragic-life-of-marjorie-bruce.html|title=The Tragic Life Of Marjorie Bruce, Princess Of Scotland|access-date=2018-04-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/women/wih10.htm|title=Women in History of Scots Descent - Marjory Bruce|website=www.electricscotland.com|access-date=2018-04-11}}</ref> She was later buried at the abbey. A [[cairn]], at the junction of Dundonald Road and Renfrew Road, approximately {{convert|1|mi|km|0|abbr=off}} to the north of the Abbey, marks the spot where she reputedly fell from her horse.\n\nIn 1491, absolution was granted by Abbot George Shaw, representing the [[Pope]] and in the presence of the relics, to [[James IV of Scotland]] and others implicated in the death of [[James III of Scotland|James III]] at the [[Battle of Sauchieburn]].  By 1499 Shaw had had built a new, larger pilgrims' chapel and added the sculptured stone frieze which can still be seen today, showing scenes from the life of St Miren.  It was originally brightly painted and may have been part of a rear panel of an altar before being put up as a frieze on the wall.<ref>\"Pilgrimage in Medieval Scotland\" by Peter Yeoman, Historic Scotland 1999</ref>\n\n[[File:Paisley Abbey from the south east.jpg|thumb|640px|center|Paisley Abbey from the south west]]\nA succession of fires and the collapse of the tower in the 15th and 16th centuries left the building in a partially ruined state. Although the western section was still used for worship, the eastern section was widely plundered for its stone. From 1858 to 1928 the north [[porch]] and the eastern [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] were reconstructed on the remains of the ruined walls by the architect Macgregor Chalmers. After his death, work on the choir was completed by Sir [[Robert Lorimer]].<ref>[http://www.paisleyabbey.org.uk/abbeyhistory.htm Paisley Abbey website, ibid.]</ref>\n\n==Points of interest==\nPaisley Abbey is the burial place of all six [[House of Stuart|High Stewards]] of Scotland, [[Marjorie Bruce]] who was the mother of [[Robert II of Scotland|Robert II]] and the wives of Robert II and [[Robert III of Scotland|King Robert III]]. The [[Celt]]ic [[Barochan Cross]], once sited near the village of [[Houston, Scotland|Houston]], Renfrewshire, is now located inside the abbey itself. The cross is thought to date from the 10th century. In the abbey's nave, the Wallace Memorial Window, which depicts the image of Samson, was donated in 1873.\n\n=== The Paisley Abbey Drain ===\nIn the early 1990s  an ancient vaulted drain of extremely fine construction, probably 13th century in date, was rediscovered running from the abbey to the White Cart.

Originally in development during September 2017 at [[The CW]], the series was intended to be a companion series to ''[[Riverdale (2017 TV series)|Riverdale]]''; however, in December 2017, the project was moved to Netflix with a straight-to-series order, consisting of twenty episodes. Filming took place in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].\n\nThe first half of the first season, consisting of ten episodes, was released on October 26, 2018.

In those articles, Olsen claimed to have uncovered evidence that undermined the Cantu conviction. According to Olsen, the jury Forewoman, the then-District Attorney, the trial Judge, the co-defendant, and the surviving victim all expressed misgivings about the outcome of the Cantu case. The only evidence linking Cantu to the crime was the testimony of Juan Moreno, the surviving victim, but he since recanted his testimony, claiming he had felt threatened by police.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/printstory.mpl/chronicle/3472872 |title=The Cantu case: death and doubt |work=Houston Chronicle |date=July 24, 2006 |first=Lise |last=Olsen |accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref>\n\nAs the District Attorney, Susan Reed investigated the claims of wrongful conviction in the Cantu case. The investigation was to determine if Moreno should be charged with murder by perjury.    Her office concluded that Cantu was justifiably executed in 1993 and that no credible evidence existed to support the witnesses' claims of innocence.

She is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].\n\n==Career==\nReed was elected [[District Attorney]] of [[Bexar County, TX|Bexar County]] ([[San Antonio]]) in 1998, becoming the first woman to hold the office. She served as Judge of the 144th District Court ([[San Antonio]]) from 1986 to 1998. She served as an [[Assistant District Attorney]] for Bexar County from 1974 to 1982, including duties as chief prosecutor for court districts 144 and 187. Reed was in private practice from 1982 to 1986, with the firm Soules and Reed, specializing in business litigation.\n\nDuring her [[tenure]] as a 144th District Court Judge, she helped create a \"Gang Unit\" in the [[Probation|Adult Probation]] department. As [[Bexar County, TX|Bexar County]] District Attorney, she has created a new \"Elder Fraud Unit\" and successfully lobbied the Texas Legislature to increase penalties for crimes against the elderly. Reed is a member of the [[National Advisory Council on Violence Against Women]]. She was appointed to the [[Criminal Justice Policy Council]] for [[Governor of Texas|Governor]] [[Bill Clements]]. Later, Governor [[George W. Bush]] appointed her to serve on the Governor\u2019s Juvenile Justice Advisory Board. She continued to serve on that board under Governor [[Rick Perry]].<ref name=\"Da2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bexar.org/da2/sreed/sreedbio.htm |publisher=Bexar County District Attorney's Office |title=Susan Reed : Criminal District Attorney| date= |accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref>\n\n== 2014 Midterm Elections ==\n\nSusan Reed was defeated by Democrat [[Nicholas \"Nico\" LaHood]] on November 4, 2014 during the midterm elections by a margin of 48 to 51 percent, respectively.  Lahood went against Reed back in 2010, but was defeated by a margin of 54-46 percent.  LaHood was supported in 2014  by 1.5 million dollars from Thomas J Henry, a personal injury lawyer who had ties to lawyers Reed had indicted for barratry.  See Bexar County Elections Department COH reports.\n\n== Involvements in the case of Ruben Cantu ==\nThe 1985 conviction and 1993 execution of [[Ruben Cantu]] were the subject of a series of investigative articles by ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' reporter Lise Olsen in 2005 and 2006. In those articles, Olsen claimed to have uncovered evidence that undermined the Cantu conviction. According to Olsen, the jury Forewoman, the then-District Attorney, the trial Judge, the co-defendant, and the surviving victim all expressed misgivings about the outcome of the Cantu case. The only evidence linking Cantu to the crime was the testimony of Juan Moreno, the surviving victim, but he since recanted his testimony, claiming he had felt threatened by police.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/printstory.mpl/chronicle/3472872 |title=The Cantu case: death and doubt |work=Houston Chronicle |date=July 24, 2006 |first=Lise |last=Olsen |accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref>\n\nAs the District Attorney, Susan Reed investigated the claims of wrongful conviction in the Cantu case. The investigation was to determine if Moreno should be charged with murder by perjury.    Her office concluded that Cantu was justifiably executed in 1993 and that no credible evidence existed to support the witnesses' claims of innocence. The report concluded that Moreno had been induced to change his testimony by those seeking to undermine the integrity of Cantu's conviction.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/APStories/stories/D8Q11L6G0.html|title=Bexar County DA's report says Cantu execution was justified |author=Associated Press |date=June 27, 2007|work=Dallas Morning News|accessdate=1 May 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nMany of Reed's critics called into question the validity and objectivity of her investigation because, as a state district judge, Susan reviewed one of Cantu's appeals and signed his death warrant.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/node/1804|title=Texas Editorials Call for Independent Investigation of Possible Wrongful Execution |date=Sep 2, 2006|work=Dallas Morning News}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.bexar.org/da2/ Bexar County Criminal District Attorney's Office]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Reed, Susan}}\n[[Category:County district attorneys in Texas]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1950 births]]\n[[Category:American women judges]]\n[[Category:Texas state court judges]]\n", "name_user": "Plibby", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Bio)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Reed"}

As soon as Campbell had read the proofs, he swept indignantly into the shop and commanded McCormick, \"So long as you live, don't you ever diminish the Savior's name again. Put it all in.\" The puckish McCormick obeyed, and then some: he set Jesus H. Christ and printed up all the pamphlets.<ref>Smith (1994:332).  See also R.

Avoiding \"J. C.\" required three of 16 pages to be reset.</ref></blockquote>\n\nSmith suggests (1994:331-2) that \"Jesus H. Christ\" is a specifically American profanity, and indicates that at least in his experience it is uttered primarily by men. Quinion (2009), a British author, likewise specifies the phrase as belonging to American English.\n\n== Stress pattern ==\nMultiple authors emphasize the practice of placing a strong stress on the \"H\", relating it in various ways to [[expletive infixation]]. Thus Quinion writes:\n\n<blockquote>Its long survival must have a lot to do with its cadence, and the way that an especially strong stress can be placed on the H. You might also think of it as an example of emphatic infixing that loosely fits the models of words like ''abso-bloody-lutely'' or ''tribu-bloody-lation''.<ref>Quinion (2009)</ref></blockquote>\n\nSimilar remarks were made by the linguist [[Dwight Bolinger]], who mentions \"Jesus H. Christ\" in a discussion of the strategies used by English speakers to add additional stresses to \"highly charged words\" for purposes of emphasis.<ref>Bolinger (1986:84-86)</ref> Horberry suggests \"The strong emphasis on the H somehow improves the rhythm of its host phrase.\"<ref>Horberry (2010:25)</ref> The ''Green's Dictionary of Slang'' says \"the H is redundant other than for rhythm\".<ref>Online edition, https://greensdictofslang.com/entry/vi5qeqa</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[File:IHC-monogram-Jesus-medievalesque.svg|right|thumb|The [[Christogram|divine monogram]], conjectured to be the source of \"Jesus H. Christ\"]]\nUsing the name of Jesus Christ as an oath has been common for many centuries. But the precise origins of the letter ''H'' in the expression ''Jesus H. Christ'' are obscure. While many explanations have been proposed, the most widely accepted derivation is from the [[Christogram|divine monogram]] of Christian symbolism. The symbol, derived from the first three letters of the [[Greek language|Greek]] name of Jesus ({{lang|grc|\u0399\u0397\u03a3\u039f\u03a5\u03a3}}), is transliterated iota-eta-sigma, which can look like IHS, {{lang|grc|\u0399\u0397\u03f9}} (with [[lunate sigma]]), JHS or JHC (\"J\" was historically a mere variant of \"I\"; see [[J]]).\n\nFor how this learned-sounding abbreviation could have served as the basis for vulgar slang, Smith offers the hypothesis that it was noticed by ordinary people when it was worn as a decoration on the [[vestment]]s of [[Anglican]] (i.e., in America, [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]]) clergy.<ref name=\"S332\">Smith (1994:332)</ref> The \"JHC\" variant would particularly invite interpretation of the \"H\" as part of a name.\n\n=== Folk etymology ===\nIf this is the most likely origin of the \"H\", there remains the issue of [[folk etymology]]; that is, the sense shared by ordinary people (not necessarily historically correct) of where the H comes from. Here, a possible origin is the name \"Harold\"; which indeed is mentioned by Smith (1994:32) as the basis of a variant form, \"Jesus Harold Christ\". The \"Harold\" may arise from a common misinterpretation (often by children) of the phrase in the [[Lord's Prayer]], \"Our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name.\" This phrase can be mistakenly interpreted as specifying the name of the Deity (\"thy name is ... \"), rather than the true reading, which is \"may thy name be hallowed\". The confusion would arise from the phonetic similarity of ''hallowed'' ([[Help:IPA|IPA]] [\u02c8h\u00e6lo\u028ad]) to ''Harold'' (IPA [\u02c8h\u00e6r\u0259ld]).<ref>For web attestations of the misinterpretation, see [http://www.kissthisguy.com/our-father-who-art-in-heaven-harold-be-misheard-21128.htm], [http://www.iusedtobelieve.com/religion/prayers/prayers_d10.php], [http://www.holyvisions.co.uk/visionsjokes.htm], [http://www.karlroadcc.org/node/28], and [https://books.google.com/books?id=L02fnVSQSBwC&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=Harold+be+thy+name&source=bl&ots=yyQsBJOhLr&sig=Mdcgs20UF-1Jq6rE1BAP_ZjDzgk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZO0xVL3aFo6oogTekoCIBQ&ved=0CB0Q6AEwADge#v=onepage&q=Harold%20be%20thy%20name&f=false]</ref>\n\nIan Ransom reports another folk etymology in a memoir of his childhood. The context is how local adults habitually yelled at children:\n\n<blockquote>I hailed from devoted Jesus ''H.'' Christ territory. As a child, \"H\" was a middle initial meaning \"Holy\" and included to honor Jesus while his name was being used to scramble young brains into malleable balls of pure fear. Most folks bellowed the simple \"Jesus Christ,\" so children felt privileged to hear that added \"H.\"<ref>Ransom (2006:37)</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Variants ==\nThe number of variant forms, usually with \"H\" replaced by something longer, is vast.<ref>A machine search of the internet for expressions occurring in the frame \"Jesus _____ Christ\", both h-initial and more generally, is reported by blogger \"Tensor\" at [http://tenser.typepad.com/tenser_said_the_tensor/2007/01/what_does_the_h.html].</ref> \"Jesus Harold Christ\" (i.e. - \"Our Father, who art in Heaven, Harold be thy name...\") is mentioned above. Smith notes Jesus Holy Christ, Jesus Henry Christ, and Jesus H. Particular Christ.<ref name=\"S332\" /> ''Green's Dictionary of Slang'' gives Jeezus K. Reist, Jesus F. Christ, Jesus H, Jesus H. Mahogany Christ, Jesus Hopping Christ, Jesus Johnnycake Christ, Jesus X. Christ, and Judas H. Christ.<!-- Please only add something if you can provide a cited published reference source; else this list will swell beyond reason.-->\n\nFor Smith, the very presence of so many spelled-out variants is part of the humor -- and blasphemy -- inherent in \"Jesus H. Christ\". He suggests that the H offers \"the power of taking the Lord's name in vain by adding something to it that the imagination is invited to complete: What does the H. stand for? -- whatever the errant imagination proposes and the imaginer is disposed to enjoy.\"<ref>Smith (1994:334)</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n* Bolinger, Dwight (1986) ''Intonation and its parts: melody in spoken English''.

Quinion (2009), a British author, likewise specifies the phrase as belonging to American English.\n\n== Stress pattern ==\nMultiple authors emphasize the practice of placing a strong stress on the \"H\", relating it in various ways to [[expletive infixation]]. Thus Quinion writes:\n\n<blockquote>Its long survival must have a lot to do with its cadence, and the way that an especially strong stress can be placed on the H. You might also think of it as an example of emphatic infixing that loosely fits the models of words like ''abso-bloody-lutely'' or ''tribu-bloody-lation''.<ref>Quinion (2009)</ref></blockquote>\n\nSimilar remarks were made by the linguist [[Dwight Bolinger]], who mentions \"Jesus H. Christ\" in a discussion of the strategies used by English speakers to add additional stresses to \"highly charged words\" for purposes of emphasis.<ref>Bolinger (1986:84-86)</ref> Horberry suggests \"The strong emphasis on the H somehow improves the rhythm of its host phrase.\"<ref>Horberry (2010:25)</ref> The ''Green's Dictionary of Slang'' says \"the H is redundant other than for rhythm\".<ref>Online edition, https://greensdictofslang.com/entry/vi5qeqa</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[File:IHC-monogram-Jesus-medievalesque.svg|right|thumb|The [[Christogram|divine monogram]], conjectured to be the source of \"Jesus H. Christ\"]]\nUsing the name of Jesus Christ as an oath has been common for many centuries. But the precise origins of the letter ''H'' in the expression ''Jesus H. Christ'' are obscure. While many explanations have been proposed, the most widely accepted derivation is from the [[Christogram|divine monogram]] of Christian symbolism. The symbol, derived from the first three letters of the [[Greek language|Greek]] name of Jesus ({{lang|grc|\u0399\u0397\u03a3\u039f\u03a5\u03a3}}), is transliterated iota-eta-sigma, which can look like IHS, {{lang|grc|\u0399\u0397\u03f9}} (with [[lunate sigma]]), JHS or JHC (\"J\" was historically a mere variant of \"I\"; see [[J]]).\n\nFor how this learned-sounding abbreviation could have served as the basis for vulgar slang, Smith offers the hypothesis that it was noticed by ordinary people when it was worn as a decoration on the [[vestment]]s of [[Anglican]] (i.e., in America, [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]]) clergy.<ref name=\"S332\">Smith (1994:332)</ref> The \"JHC\" variant would particularly invite interpretation of the \"H\" as part of a name.\n\n=== Folk etymology ===\nIf this is the most likely origin of the \"H\", there remains the issue of [[folk etymology]]; that is, the sense shared by ordinary people (not necessarily historically correct) of where the H comes from. Here, a possible origin is the name \"Harold\"; which indeed is mentioned by Smith (1994:32) as the basis of a variant form, \"Jesus Harold Christ\". The \"Harold\" may arise from a common misinterpretation (often by children) of the phrase in the [[Lord's Prayer]], \"Our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name.\" This phrase can be mistakenly interpreted as specifying the name of the Deity (\"thy name is ... \"), rather than the true reading, which is \"may thy name be hallowed\". The confusion would arise from the phonetic similarity of ''hallowed'' ([[Help:IPA|IPA]] [\u02c8h\u00e6lo\u028ad]) to ''Harold'' (IPA [\u02c8h\u00e6r\u0259ld]).<ref>For web attestations of the misinterpretation, see [http://www.kissthisguy.com/our-father-who-art-in-heaven-harold-be-misheard-21128.htm], [http://www.iusedtobelieve.com/religion/prayers/prayers_d10.php], [http://www.holyvisions.co.uk/visionsjokes.htm], [http://www.karlroadcc.org/node/28], and [https://books.google.com/books?id=L02fnVSQSBwC&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=Harold+be+thy+name&source=bl&ots=yyQsBJOhLr&sig=Mdcgs20UF-1Jq6rE1BAP_ZjDzgk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZO0xVL3aFo6oogTekoCIBQ&ved=0CB0Q6AEwADge#v=onepage&q=Harold%20be%20thy%20name&f=false]</ref>\n\nIan Ransom reports another folk etymology in a memoir of his childhood. The context is how local adults habitually yelled at children:\n\n<blockquote>I hailed from devoted Jesus ''H.'' Christ territory. As a child, \"H\" was a middle initial meaning \"Holy\" and included to honor Jesus while his name was being used to scramble young brains into malleable balls of pure fear. Most folks bellowed the simple \"Jesus Christ,\" so children felt privileged to hear that added \"H.\"<ref>Ransom (2006:37)</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Variants ==\nThe number of variant forms, usually with \"H\" replaced by something longer, is vast.<ref>A machine search of the internet for expressions occurring in the frame \"Jesus _____ Christ\", both h-initial and more generally, is reported by blogger \"Tensor\" at [http://tenser.typepad.com/tenser_said_the_tensor/2007/01/what_does_the_h.html].</ref> \"Jesus Harold Christ\" (i.e. - \"Our Father, who art in Heaven, Harold be thy name...\") is mentioned above. Smith notes Jesus Holy Christ, Jesus Henry Christ, and Jesus H. Particular Christ.<ref name=\"S332\" /> ''Green's Dictionary of Slang'' gives Jeezus K. Reist, Jesus F. Christ, Jesus H, Jesus H. Mahogany Christ, Jesus Hopping Christ, Jesus Johnnycake Christ, Jesus X. Christ, and Judas H. Christ.<!-- Please only add something if you can provide a cited published reference source; else this list will swell beyond reason.-->\n\nFor Smith, the very presence of so many spelled-out variants is part of the humor -- and blasphemy -- inherent in \"Jesus H. Christ\". He suggests that the H offers \"the power of taking the Lord's name in vain by adding something to it that the imagination is invited to complete: What does the H. stand for? -- whatever the errant imagination proposes and the imaginer is disposed to enjoy.\"<ref>Smith (1994:334)</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n* Bolinger, Dwight (1986) ''Intonation and its parts: melody in spoken English''.

According to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Sam & Dave were the most successful soul duo and brought the sounds of the black gospel church to pop music with their call-and-response records. Recorded primarily at [[Stax Records]] in Memphis, Tennessee, from 1965 through 1968, these included \"[[Soul Man (song)|Soul Man]]\", \"[[Hold On, I'm Comin' (song)|Hold On, I'm Comin']]\", \"You Don't Know Like I Know\", \"I Thank You\", \"When Something is Wrong with My Baby\", \"Wrap It Up\", and many other Southern Soul classics. Except for [[Aretha Franklin]], no soul act during Sam & Dave's Stax years (1965\u20131968) had more consistent R&B chart success, including 10 consecutive top 20 singles and three consecutive top 10 LPs.<ref>''An Anthology of Sam & Dave: The Stax Years: 1965 to 1968'' CD liner notes page 1 Rob Bowman</ref> Their crossover charts appeal (13 straight appearances and two top 10 singles) helped to pave the way for the acceptance of soul music by white pop audiences, and their song \"Soul Man\" was one of the first songs by a black group to top the pop charts using the word \"soul\", helping define the genre. \"Soul Man\" was a number one Pop Hit (''Cashbox'': November 11, 1967) and has been recognized as one of the most influential songs of the past 50 years by the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]], the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, and [[RIAA]] Songs of the Century.  \"Soul Man\" was featured as the soundtrack and title for a 1986 film and also a 1997\u20131998 television series, and ''[[Soul Men]]'' was a 2008 feature film.\n\nNicknamed \"Double Dynamite\", \"The Sultans of Sweat\", and \"The Dynamic Duo\" for their gritty, gospel-infused performances, Sam & Dave are considered one of the greatest live acts of the 1960s. Many subsequent musicians have named them as an influence, including [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Al Green]], [[Tom Petty]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[The Jam]], [[Teddy Pendergrass]], [[Billy Joel]] and [[Steve Winwood]]. [[The Blues Brothers]], who helped create a resurgence of popularity for [[soul music|soul]], [[rhythm and blues|R&B]], and [[blues music|blues]] in the 1980s, were influenced by Sam & Dave \u2013 their biggest hit was a cover of \"[[Soul Man (song)|Soul Man]]\", and their act and stage show contained many homages to the duo.\n\n==Early years== \n\nSam Moore and Dave Prater's early musical backgrounds involved listening to and singing gospel music in their homes and churches, and in Dave's case, also singing gospel in the choir in his church. Dave later sang with his older brother JT Prater in the gospel group The Sensational Hummingbirds, who recorded \"Lord Teach Me\" in the 1950s. Sam recorded \"Nitey-Nite\"/\"Caveman Rock\" in 1954 with the doo-wop group The Majestics, and later sang with the gospel groups The Gales and The Mellonaires. Moore and Prater listed [[Jackie Wilson]] and [[Sam Cooke]] as influences on their styles,<ref>''Sam & Dave \u2013 An Oral History'' Moore & Marsh, Avon Books 1998 pp 24\u201325,27\u201328</ref> and Moore was also influenced by [[Little Willie John]], whom he and Dave opened for often in the early 1960s.\n\nSam & Dave met working the gospel music circuit, and later in small clubs in Miami during amateur nights in 1961 according to Dave.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Interview with Dave Prater and Dave Booth cover of 1984 ''I Can't Stand Up for Falling Down'' LP</ref> They sang together one night at the King of Hearts club, and started working together immediately thereafter, developing a live act featuring gospel-inspired call-and-response. Soul singer and record producer [[Steve Alaimo]] discovered them while performing during the same show with them at the King of Hearts nightclub in Miami and signed them to [[Marlin Records]].\n\nAfter two singles in early 1962 were released on the local Marlin label owned by Miami's [[Henry Stone]], Stone helped sign them to [[Roulette Records]] in [[New York City]]. They released six 45s from 1962\u20131964 (two were re-releases of Marlin recordings) with Roulette, and one single on Stone and Alaimo's Alston Label. A few of the singles received regional airplay, but did not achieve national chart success. The songs, some of which were produced by [[Steve Alaimo]] and some of which were produced by [[Henry Glover]], were similar in many ways to R&B recordings by Sam Cooke, Jackie Wilson and Little Willie John. Prater was the lead vocalist on most of these singles, with Moore singing harmony and alternate verses.\n\nIn summer 1964, Stone introduced the duo to [[Atlantic Records]]' [[Jerry Wexler]], who signed them to Atlantic.<ref>''Soulville'', Bowman pp 66\u201369</ref> Wexler asked [[Memphis, Tennessee]]-based [[Stax Records]], which Atlantic distributed nationally, to work with Sam & Dave. Wexler wanted the Southern roots and gospel style of their live performances, so the pair were loaned to Stax to record, although they remained [[Atlantic Records]] artists. According to Wexler's autobiography ''Rhythms & Blues'', \"Their live act was filled with animation, harmony and seeming goodwill. I put Sam in the sweet tradition of Sam Cooke or [[Solomon Burke]], while Dave had an ominous [[Four Tops]]' [[Levi Stubbs]]-sounding voice, the preacher promising hellfire.\"\n\n==Stax years (1965\u20131968)==\n\n===Arrival at Stax and early Stax singles===\n[[File:Sam & Dave.png|thumb|right|Sam & Dave in 1966]]\nWhen Sam & Dave arrived at Stax, they worked with producer & engineer [[Jim Stewart (music)|Jim Stewart]] and songwriters including the MGs' guitarist [[Steve Cropper]], who wrote or co-wrote four of their first eight recordings. The duo then moved to relative newcomer writers and producers [[Isaac Hayes]] and [[David Porter (musician)|David Porter]]. Hayes and Porter wrote and produced the duo's biggest hits (although they did not receive production credits until the ''Soul Men'' LP and singles). According to Moore and Prater, they also greatly influenced the duo's singing style,<ref>''Soulsville'', Bowman pp 67\u201369</ref> and shifted their recording style from the style of their Roulette records to a more live, more energetic gospel, call-and-response feel and beat driven soul style the group is known for today.\n\nSam & Dave's Stax records also benefited from the musicians and engineering at Stax. The Stax house band, [[Booker T. & the M.G.'s]], and the Stax horn section, the [[Mar-Keys]], were world-class musicians who co-wrote (often without credit) and contributed to recordings\u2014the same musicians who recorded with [[Otis Redding]], [[Wilson Pickett]], [[Carla Thomas]] and other soul artists. Sam & Dave's Stax recordings through 1967 were engineered by Stax founder [[Jim Stewart (music)|Jim Stewart]], who created the Memphis Sound by recording live in a single take. Stewart is credited for instrumental mixes that allowed for instrumental separation and the distinct contribution of each instrument to the overall feel of the song.\n\nWhile the first two Stax singles failed to chart, the third, the Hayes/Porter composition (with similarities, including the title, to a gospel standard) \"You Don't Know Like I Know\" hit #7 R&B in 1966. This was the first of 10 consecutive Top Twenty R&B chart hits over three years, and 14 R&B chart appearances during their career.\n\n===\"Hold On, I'm Comin{{'\"}} single and ''Hold On, I'm Comin''' LP===\n\"[[Hold On, I'm Comin' (song)|Hold On, I'm Comin']]{{-\"}} (R&B#1/Pop#21), released in March 1966, was an enormous R&B hit for Sam & Dave, and also their first single to break into the Top 40 Pop charts. The song was named the #1 song of the year for 1966 by the ''Billboard'' R&B charts, and spent 20 weeks on the R&B charts in 1966, peaking at #1 in June. In 1988, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' named it one of the best 100 songs of the past 25 years. \"Hold On, I'm Comin{{'\"}} received a belated [[RIAA]] [[music recording sales certification|gold record]] for one million sales in 1995, 29 years after its release.<ref name=\"Soulville Bowman pp 91-92\">''Soulville'' Bowman pp 91\u201392</ref> \"Hold On, I'm Comin{{'\"}} has since been recorded by dozens of other artists.\n\n\"Hold On, I'm Comin{{'\"}} was also the first recording on which Moore took lead on the first verse and Prater was given the response role and second verse at Hayes and Porter's suggestion. The duo used this format (singing dual leads) on most of their songs. The song was created when Hayes called to Porter, who was in the bathroom. Porter supposedly said \"Hold on, man. I'm comin',\" and Hayes and Porter wrote the song within 10 minutes.<ref name=\"Soulville Bowman pp 91-92\"/> \"Hold On, I'm Comin'{{-\"}}, when released, received objections from radio stations over the suggestive title. This resulted in a name change by Stewart and quick re-recording and re-release, and nearly all the original U.S. copies of the single bear the title \"Hold On, I'm A-Comin'\".\n\nThe LP ''[[Hold On, I'm Comin']]'' (4/66) reached #1 for 19 weeks on the R&B album charts in 1966. After Sam & Dave's chart success, Roulette quickly released the album ''Sam & Dave'' in 1966 as well, a collection of the A & B sides of their six Roulette 45s, which did not chart.\n\n===''When Something is Wrong, Double Dynamite'' LP and singles===\nSam & Dave's next huge R&B hit was \"When Something is Wrong With My Baby,\" their only ballad single, which was released in January 1967. Stax author Rob Bowman called this \"One of the most sublime records in soul music's history,\" and Mar-Keys trumpet player Wayne Jackson called it the greatest song he has ever heard. This was the only Sam & Dave hit where Dave sang the first verse solo; their other hits started with Sam & Dave together or Sam singing the first verse. \"When Something is Wrong With My Baby\" has since become an often recorded and performed duet for male and female singers performing together.\n\nThe duo also charted in late 1966 with the top 10 R&B hits  \"Said I Wasn't Gonna Tell Nobody,\" and \"You Got Me Hummin\". These three singles, along with other tracks, were compiled on ''Double Dynamite'' (12/66), Sam & Dave's second LP on Stax. The LP peaked at #7 R&B and #118 Pop.\n\n===\"Soul Man\" single and ''Soul Men'' LP===\nSam & Dave's biggest hit and best-remembered song, \"[[Soul Man (song)|Soul Man]]\" (R&B #1/Pop #2),<ref name=pc51>{{Gilliland|https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19832/m1/ |Show 51 \u2013 The Soul Reformation: Phase three, soul music at the summit.

Sam & Dave won the [[Grammy Award]] in 1967 for ''\"Best Performance \u2013 Rhythm & Blues Group\"'' for \"Soul Man,\" their first gold record. \"Soul Man\" was voted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] in 1999. The song helped name the emerging music genre as \"Soul Music\". According to co-writer Isaac Hayes, the title was inspired by news reports of soul pride that emerged after the 1967 race riots, where stores that painting the word \"soul\" on your door was a message for looters to bypass your house. Hayes-Porter extrapolated that to \"I'm a soul brother, I'm a soul man.\". It has been recognized as one of the best or most influential songs of 50 years by the Grammy Hall of Fame, The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, ''Rolling Stone'', and R.I.A.A. Songs of the Century. \"Soul Man\" was used as the soundtrack and title for a 1986 film, a 2008 film ''[[Soul Men]]'', a 1997\u20131998 television series. In 2019, \"Soul Man\" was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Andrews |first=Travis M. |date=March 20, 2019 |title=Jay-Z, a speech by Sen.

Critics commented that the B-side \"Wrap It Up\" could have been a separate successful single, which it later became for [[The Fabulous Thunderbirds]]. Because the duo were so busy touring, Hayes & Porter traveled to Europe to record the vocal track on \"Wrap It Up\" in order to release the single. Due to the end of the distribution agreement between Stax and [[Atlantic Records]] in May 1968, \"I Thank You\" was Sam & Dave's final single on Stax. Although they continued to work at Stax with Hayes/Porter, as of May 1968, the duo's work was released on Atlantic Records. \"I Thank You\" sold over one million copies, earning it gold record status.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book\n| first= Joseph\n| last= Murrells\n| year= 1978\n| title= The Book of Golden Discs\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd\n| location= London\n| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/247 247]\n| isbn= 0-214-20512-6\n| url-access= registration\n| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/247\n}}</ref>\n\nSam & Dave's first 1968 single for Atlantic was \"You Don't Know What You Mean to Me,\" written by [[Eddie Floyd]] and [[Steve Cropper]] (R&B #19/Pop #48). Sam & Dave said it was their favorite of their songs.<ref>''Blitz'' magazine \u2013 July 1978, p8</ref> Sam & Dave also released \"Can't You Find Another Way (of Doing It)\" (#20 R&B/#54 Pop), but it was not included in the ''I Thank You'' LP. Their final single of 1968, \"Everybody Got to Believe in Somebody,\" charted in the lower levels of the pop charts and ended Sam & Dave's streak at 10 straight R&B top 20 singles.\n\nThough on Atlantic, the ''I Thank You'' LP (10/68) included 1968 singles initially on both Stax and Atlantic. The LP peaked at #38 on the R&B charts, and was the only LP of their Stax recordings not to chart on the Pop LP charts.<ref>''Soulsville'', Bowman pp 138</ref>\n\n===Sam & Dave's live performances===\nSam & Dave's live act earned them the nickname \"Double Dynamite.\" Phil Walden, Otis Redding's manager, said \"I think Sam & Dave will probably stand the test of time as being the best live act that there ever was. Those guys were absolutely unbelievable. Every night they were awesome.\" An article from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' in October 1968 reads: \"Of all the R&B cats, nobody steams up a place like Sam & Dave ... weaving and dancing (while singing!), they gyrate through enough acrobatics to wear out more than 100 costumes per year.\" Jerri Hershey described in ''Nowhere to Run'': They carried red suits, white suits, three piece lime green suits, all with matching patent boots and coordinated silk hankies woefully inadequate to absorb a soul man's nightly outpourings. Both Sam & Dave talk a lot about sweat. To Dave, its proof that he's worked for his pay. For Sam its essential, almost mystical. He says he cannot work without it.  \"Unless my body reaches a certain temperature, starts to liquefy, I just don't feel right without it.\" Wayne Jackson said Sam & Dave left puddles of sweat onstage by the end of a performance.\n\nIn March 1967, Sam & Dave were co-headliners for the Stax/Volt Revue in Europe, which included [[Booker T & the MGs]], The [[Mar-Keys]], [[Eddie Floyd]], [[Carla Thomas]], [[Arthur Conley]] and headliner [[Otis Redding]]. It was the duo's first trip to Europe. Although Redding headlined the tour, many agreed Sam & Dave stole the show on many nights. According to Redding's and Sam & Dave's manager Phil Walden, Redding refused to be booked on the same bill with Sam & Dave again, not wanting to have to follow their explosive act. A live version of \"Soothe Me\" from Sam & Dave's ''Double Dynamite'' LP was recorded in Paris during the 1967 tour. Released as a single in mid-1967, it continued Sam & Dave's string of top 20 U.S. R&B hits and was their first in the UK Top 40.\n\nAfter the tour, Sam & Dave worked as headliners in the U.S. and in Europe during Fall 1967, Fall 1968 and January 1970, and in Japan in 1969 and 1970. They averaged 280 shows per year from 1967 through 1969 and in 1967, they only took ten days off. Other high points included headlining the [[Expo 67|Montreal World's Fair]] in 1967, performing at the tribute to Martin Luther King, Jr. at Madison Square Garden in June 1968, being the first black soul act to headline the [[Fillmore East]] in December 1968, and headlining the [[Texas International Pop Festival]] for two nights in August 1969. Sam & Dave also performed on U.S. and European television, including two appearances on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1969, appearing on [[The Tonight Show]] and [[American Bandstand]] in 1967, and performing on ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'' in 1969 and 1970. Moore frequently recalls the performances on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' as a career highlight.\n\n==The Atlantic Records years (1968\u20131972)==\n\n===''Best of'' LP, Stax-recorded singles (1969)===\nThe year 1969 started well, with the Atlantic release of ''The Best of Sam & Dave'' LP in January. It contained all of their Stax A sides except \"A Place Nobody Can Find\" and several B-sides, and peaked at #24 on the R&B LP charts and #89 on the Billboard LP charts.<ref>Billboard Charts Online</ref> Their first single of the year, \"Soul Sister, Brown Sugar,\" returned Sam & Dave to the R&B top 20, and was a #15 hit in the UK.<ref>database of UK chart singles:www.everyhit.com</ref> The follow-up \"Born Again,\" reached the lower levels of the charts, and was the last single Sam & Dave recorded at Stax.\n\n===Atlantic produced records, first break-up, and reunion (1969\u20131972)===\nJerry Wexler with co-producer [[Tom Dowd]] tried producing Sam & Dave in New York, with Atlantic songwriters and musicians. It took eight months to issue \"Ooh, Ooh, Ooh\", the first Atlantic single in August 1969.  It was not a very good record, by Sam's own admission, and it represented the first time in four years that a Sam & Dave single failed to chart.\n\nTwo more singles followed in 1970, \"Baby, Baby, Don't Stop Now,\" and \"One Part Love, Two Parts Pain.\" The first was a leftover Hayes-Porter recording from Stax; the second was produced by Wexler and Dowd in New York, and was written by Stax executive [[Al Bell]] and Allen Jones. Both failed to chart. According to Wexler, \"We just made some shit-ass records with them. I never really got into their sensibilities as a producer.\"<ref>''Soulsville'', Bowman pp 140</ref> Wexler then sent the duo south to Muscle Shoals and Miami to work with producers [[Brad Shapiro]] and Dave Crawford for their next single \"Knock It Out The Park,\" which also failed to chart.\n\nSam & Dave split in June 1970, according to Moore<ref name=\"Soul Magazine 1970\">Interview with ''Blues and Soul'' magazine (July 17\u201330, 1970) and later interviews</ref> as a result of Moore's dissatisfaction with the duo and his desire to pursue a career solo. According to Prater, they broke up because \"[Moore] decided to do what he wanted to do on his own.\" Moore recorded three solo singles (none of which charted) for Atlantic over the next year and was preparing an album produced by King Curtis, which was shelved after Curtis was stabbed to death in 1971. Prater recorded a single for Alston. Neither was commercially successful as a solo act, and they reunited in August 1971.\n\nIn October 1971, their last Atlantic single, \"[[Don't Pull Your Love]],\" was a cover of a hit by [[Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds]]. This Shapiro/Crawford production was a minor hit (R&B #36/Pop #102), but not a substantial enough commercial success to keep the duo signed to the label. Sam & Dave recorded four final songs for Atlantic in August, 1972, none of which was released by the label. Their contract with Atlantic expired shortly thereafter.\n\n==Later years (1972\u20131981)==\nDespite inability to attract a major label after Atlantic, there was still demand for public performances, especially in Europe.<ref>''Blues and Soul'' August 6\u201319, 1971 p.6</ref> They toured Turkey in Spring, 1972 and England in Spring, 1973. Sam & Dave also continued to be visible in the U.S., performing on TV shows including ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' and ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]''. According to Sam, most U.S. shows in the 1970s were small clubs, oldies shows, and whatever they could get. He attributed their poor bookings during this period to rumors of drug use and bad blood between the duo.\n\nSam & Dave returned to the studio in 1974 and 1975, recording an album of new songs titled ''Back at Cha'' for United Artists. The album \u2013 their first album of new material in 7 years \u2013 was produced by [[Steve Cropper]], and featured the MGs and The Memphis Horns and had a minor R&B single, \"A Little Bit of Good\" (R&B #89). Songwriters included Cropper, Allen Toussaint, and Jimmy Cliff.<ref>''All Music Guide To Soul'' ed Boganov/Bush/Woodstra/Erlewine 2003 Backbeat Books p.58</ref> Although the LP received positive reviews, it failed to chart. In a side project, they provided vocals on \"Come On, Come Over\" for [[Jaco Pastorius]] for his debut album on Epic in 1976.\n\nIn 1976\u201377, Sam & Dave recorded songs in the UK with producer John Abbey. Two singles were released on Abbey's Contempo label in the UK and Germany, with limited success. Ironically, given the duo's disputes, one of the last singles by Sam & Dave was a cover of [[The Beatles]] \"We Can Work It Out.\" Sam & Dave also briefly retired in 1977, with Dave working at a Pontiac dealership in New Jersey and Sam working at an Austin, Texas, law firm as a process server.\n\nIn 1978, Sam & Dave re-recorded old hits for the LP ''Sweet & Funky Gold'' (Gusto), and re-recorded songs and other soul hits during this period in Nashville for an album for [[K-Tel Records]], ''The Original Soul Man''.<ref>''Sam & Dave \u2013 An Oral History'' p.130</ref> In Summer, 1978, they toured Germany for two weeks.\n\nIn 1979, Sam & Dave enjoyed a significant resurgence of interest as a result of [[Dan Aykroyd]]'s and [[John Belushi]]'s sketch characters ''[[The Blues Brothers]], ''and the comic actors' 1979 top 40 cover of \"Soul Man.\"  Moore stated they were offered an opportunity to perform onstage with Belushi and Aykroyd on ''SNL'' but turned it down when Belushi said Sam & Dave had to perform the intro, then the Blues Brothers would take over.  According to an April 1988 interview with Aykroyd in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]],'' Aykroyd saw Sam & Dave as a teenager at the Montreal Expo in 1967 and said they were one of his biggest influences for creating The Blues Brothers. Aykroyd convinced director [[John Landis]] to include the Jake and Elwood Blues characters listening to \"Hold On, I'm Comin{{'\"}} and \"Soothe Me\" while riding in the Bluesmobile in the 1980 film ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' as a tribute to Sam & Dave.\n\nAlso in 1979, Sam & Dave opened shows for [[The Clash]] on their U.S. tour, including at the [[Palladium (music venue)|Palladium]] in New York City. In 1980, the duo performed in [[Paul Simon]]'s film ''[[One-Trick Pony (film)|One Trick Pony]]'' and, finally, on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. In 1980, they also were featured in a U.S. tour opening for the 1950s revival band [[Sha Na Na]].\n\nIn 1981, they re-recorded many hits along with [[Sam Cooke]] and [[Otis Redding]] covers for LPs titled ''Soul Study Vol. 1'' and ''Soul Study Vol. 2'' (Odyssey). The pair last performed on New Year's Eve, 1981, at the Old Waldorf in San Francisco. According to Moore, when they walked off stage it was the last time they spoke to each other.<ref>''Sam & Dave \u2013 An Oral History'' p.118</ref>\n\n==Dave Prater and Sam Daniels (1982\u20131988)==\nIn 1982, Prater started touring under the \"Sam & Dave\" name or as \"The New Sam & Dave Revue\" with Sam Daniels, who performed with Dave from October 1982 until Dave's death in 1988. Moore attempted to block Prater from using the group's name,<ref>''San Diego Union Tribune'' 9/25/85 \"Singer Finds Sour Note in New Duo's Name\" PP B1</ref> but was largely unsuccessful. The Daniels & Prater incarnation played 100 shows per year over the next seven years, including in Europe, Japan and Canada.\n\nIn 1983, Sam & Dave called on [[Billy Davis (guitarist)|J.C. \"Billy\" Davis]] to put together a band to back them at a concert at [[Pine Knob]], in [[Clarkston, Michigan]] where they were opening for [[James Brown]].<ref>[http://theconcertdatabase.com/concerts/james-brown-27 ''Date: 08/13/1983, Venue: Pine Knob Music Theater, Featured Artist(s): James Brown, Bo Diddley, Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes, Sam & Dave'' at theconcertdatabase]</ref>\n\nIn 1985, Prater and Sam Daniels released a newly sung medley of Sam & Dave hits recorded in The Netherlands, which peaked at #92 on the R&B chart and was credited to \"Sam & Dave\". Sam Moore got the record company to recall the single for using the \"Sam & Dave\" name without permission, and the record was re-labelled and re-issued by \"The New Sam & Dave Revue\".<ref>Congressional Testimony 5/21/1998 \"Protection Against Artistic Knock-Off's:Sam Moore\"</ref>\n\nPrater last performed with Sam Daniels on April 3, 1988 at a Stax Reunion at the Atlanta Civic Center, which also featured Isaac Hayes, Eddie Floyd, and Rufus and Carla Thomas. Six days later, on April 9, 1988, Prater died in a car crash in Sycamore, Georgia while driving to his mother's house.\n\n==Sam Moore solo career (1982\u2013present)==\nMoore has continued to perform and record as a solo artist, and has also performed in numerous duets with other popular artists. (See the [[Sam Moore]] article.)\n\n==Conflict between Moore and Prater==\nSam & Dave were also famous for having a very tumultuous partnership during most of their 21 years together. According to Moore, they did not speak to each other offstage for almost 13 years. During the 1970s, they broke up many times, and typically would show up separately for shows, require separate dressing rooms, not look at each other onstage, and communicate through intermediaries.<ref>Jeri Hirshey from book ''Nowhere to Run''</ref> They also had performances in the 1970s where only one of them would show up. Moore describes personal issues with Prater, drug use, touring fatigue, and a desire to do his own act with new material as contributing to their break-up.<ref name=\"Soul Magazine 1970\"/> Prater attributed their rift and break-ups to Moore's frustrations in wanting to do his own act and diversify from repeatedly performing the Sam & Dave song catalog (which Prater has said that Moore didn't like very much).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Covers by other artists/use in pop culture==\nSam & Dave songs have been recorded by other artists, including 29 covers of \"Hold On, I'm Comin'.\" Others who charted with Sam & Dave songs include [[ZZ Top]] -\"I Thank You,\" [[The Fabulous Thunderbirds]] -\"Wrap It Up,\" [[James & Bobby Purify]] -\"I Take What I Want,\" [[Linda Ronstadt]] featuring [[Aaron Neville]] -\"When Something Is Wrong with My Baby,\" [[Chuck Jackson]] & [[Maxine Brown (soul singer)|Maxine Brown]] -\"Hold On, I'm Comin',\" [[Elvis Costello]] \u2013 \"I Can't Stand Up for Falling Down\" and [[Lydia Pense]] & [[Cold Blood (band)|Cold Blood]] -\"I Take What I Want.\" A diverse group of other successful artists also recorded Sam & Dave covers including: [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Peter Frampton]], [[The Temptations]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Jackie Wilson]], [[Eurythmics]], [[Rory Gallagher]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], [[The Band]], [[Martha Reeves & the Vandellas]], [[Michael Bolton]], [[Patti LaBelle]] & [[Travis Tritt]], [[Bryan Ferry]], [[Marilyn McCoo]] & [[Billy Davis Jr.]], [[The Hollies]], [[Paul Butterfield]], [[Taj Mahal (musician)]], [[Guy Sebastian]], and [[Eric Clapton]] & [[B.B. King]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secondhandsongs.com |title=Home |publisher=SecondHandSongs |date= |accessdate=2014-04-23}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, the [[Stax Museum]] of American Soul Music opened in Memphis, and Sam & Dave are in the film made for the museum, titled ''Soulsville'', and they have a permanent wall-and-video display.\n\n[[Barack Obama]] used \"Hold On, I'm Comin{{'\"}} as a theme song on the campaign trail until Sam Moore requested that he stop using it. Eleven months later, Sam Moore performed \"Soul Man\" with [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and Elvis Costello at one of Obama's inaugural parties. A parody of \"Soul Man\" created by Moore, \"I'm a Dole Man,\" was used in the 1996 [[Bob Dole]] presidential campaign until the copyright owners objected and requested the campaign stop using it. Sam & Dave released the rare single \"Hold On, Edwin's Coming\" in 1982 to support Louisiana Governor [[Edwin Edwards]]' third run for governor. Another parody, \"I'm a Suns Fan,\" was recorded by Moore and used for the [[Phoenix Suns]] basketball games.\n\nSam & Dave songs have been used frequently in movie and TV soundtracks and commercials, including \"Hold On, I'm Comin{{'\"}} on the soundtrack of the 2007 hit film ''[[American Gangster (film)|American Gangster]]''. \"Hold On, I'm Comin{{'\"}} and \"Soothe Me\" played on the radio and 8 track player (album titled: \"The Best of Sam & Dave\") in the Bluesmobile during the 1980 hit movie ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]''. \"A Place Nobody Can Find\" was used in the background of a scene in HBO's series ''The Wire''. [[Jay Leno]] used \"Hold On, I'm Comin\" while driving his AC Cobra on his 2009 Super Bowl commercial to announce his show's move to a new time. \"Wrap It Up\" was used as a transition to commercial break for ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]''. \"Soul Man\" was used as the title and title track in the 1986 movie featuring C. Thomas Howell, and also the 1997\u20131998 television series featuring Dan Aykroyd. The movie ''[[Tapeheads]]'', released in 1988 and starring [[John Cusack]] and [[Tim Robbins]], featured Sam Moore and Junior Walker as a fictitious, legendary soul duo called The Swanky Modes.\n\nThe movie ''[[Soul Men]]'', released in November 2008, was a comedy featuring [[Bernie Mac]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]] as two feuding soul singers called \"The Real Deal.\" In February 2009, Moore filed suit against the film production company ([[Weinstein Company|The Weinstein Company]]) and the producers for infringing on the marks \"Soul Man\" and \"Soul Men,\" claiming the movie is based on the careers of Sam & Dave, and damaged both Moore's reputation and career. The suit was dismissed on summary judgment in May 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=How the Weinsteins Beat 'Soul Man' Singer Sam Moore in an Important Lawsuit|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/weinstein-sam-moore-lawsuit-330072|first=Eriq |last=Gardner|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=2012-05-29|accessdate=2013-03-22}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Sam & Dave discography}}\n\n*1966: ''[[Hold On, I'm Comin']]'' (Stax) (POP #45, R&B #1)\n*1966: ''Double Dynamite''  (Stax) (POP #118, R&B #7)\n*1967: ''[[Soul Men (album)|Soul Men]]'' (Stax) (POP #2, R&B #5)\n*1968: ''I Thank You'' (Atlantic) (R&B #38)\n*1975: ''Back at Cha'' (United Artists)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n{{commons category|Sam and Dave}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.sammoore.net/ Sam Moore's website]\n\n{{Sam & Dave}}\n{{Stax Records}}\n{{1992 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sam and Dave}}\n[[Category:American soul musical groups]]\n[[Category:African-American musical groups]]\n[[Category:American musical duos]]\n[[Category:Rhythm and blues duos]]\n[[Category:Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award winners]]\n[[Category:Atlantic Records artists]]\n[[Category:American soul musicians]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American soul and R&B duo}}\n{{Infobox musical artist|<!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject Musicians -->\n| name             = Sam & Dave\n| image            = Sam & Dave (2).png\n| image_size       = \n| caption          = Sam & Dave in 1967\n| background       = group_or_band\n| origin           = [[Miami, Florida]]\n| genre            = [[soul music|Soul]]<br />[[rhythm & blues|R&B]]<br/>[[Southern soul]]<br/>[[Rock and roll]]\n| years_active     = 1961\u20131981\n| label            = [[Roulette Records|Roulette]], [[Stax Records|Stax]], [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]], [[Gusto Records|Gusto]]\n| past_members     = [[Sam Moore]]<br />[[Dave Prater]]\n}}\n\n'''Sam & Dave''' were an American soul and R&B duo who performed together from 1961 until 1981. The tenor (higher) voice was [[Sam Moore]] (born 1935) and the baritone/tenor (lower) voice was [[Dave Prater]] (1937\u20131988).\n\nSam & Dave are inductees in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]], the [[Memphis Music Hall of Fame]], and the [[Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame|Rhythm & Blues Music Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rbhalloffame.com/index.php/hall-of-fame/inductees|title=Inductees|last=|first=|date=|publisher=National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> They are [[Grammy Award]] and multiple gold record award-winning artists. According to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Sam & Dave were the most successful soul duo and brought the sounds of the black gospel church to pop music with their call-and-response records. Recorded primarily at [[Stax Records]] in Memphis, Tennessee, from 1965 through 1968, these included \"[[Soul Man (song)|Soul Man]]\", \"[[Hold On, I'm Comin' (song)|Hold On, I'm Comin']]\", \"You Don't Know Like I Know\", \"I Thank You\", \"When Something is Wrong with My Baby\", \"Wrap It Up\", and many other Southern Soul classics. Except for [[Aretha Franklin]], no soul act during Sam & Dave's Stax years (1965\u20131968) had more consistent R&B chart success, including 10 consecutive top 20 singles and three consecutive top 10 LPs.<ref>''An Anthology of Sam & Dave: The Stax Years: 1965 to 1968'' CD liner notes page 1 Rob Bowman</ref> Their crossover charts appeal (13 straight appearances and two top 10 singles) helped to pave the way for the acceptance of soul music by white pop audiences, and their song \"Soul Man\" was one of the first songs by a black group to top the pop charts using the word \"soul\", helping define the genre. \"Soul Man\" was a number one Pop Hit (''Cashbox'': November 11, 1967) and has been recognized as one of the most influential songs of the past 50 years by the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]], the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, and [[RIAA]] Songs of the Century.  \"Soul Man\" was featured as the soundtrack and title for a 1986 film and also a 1997\u20131998 television series, and ''[[Soul Men]]'' was a 2008 feature film.\n\nNicknamed \"Double Dynamite\", \"The Sultans of Sweat\", and \"The Dynamic Duo\" for their gritty, gospel-infused performances, Sam & Dave are considered one of the greatest live acts of the 1960s. Many subsequent musicians have named them as an influence, including [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Al Green]], [[Tom Petty]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[The Jam]], [[Teddy Pendergrass]], [[Billy Joel]] and [[Steve Winwood]]. [[The Blues Brothers]], who helped create a resurgence of popularity for [[soul music|soul]], [[rhythm and blues|R&B]], and [[blues music|blues]] in the 1980s, were influenced by Sam & Dave \u2013 their biggest hit was a cover of \"[[Soul Man (song)|Soul Man]]\", and their act and stage show contained many homages to the duo.\n\n==Early years== \n\nSam Moore and Dave Prater's early musical backgrounds involved listening to and singing gospel music in their homes and churches, and in Dave's case, also singing gospel in the choir in his church. Dave later sang with his older brother JT Prater in the gospel group The Sensational Hummingbirds, who recorded \"Lord Teach Me\" in the 1950s. Sam recorded \"Nitey-Nite\"/\"Caveman Rock\" in 1954 with the doo-wop group The Majestics, and later sang with the gospel groups The Gales and The Mellonaires. Moore and Prater listed [[Jackie Wilson]] and [[Sam Cooke]] as influences on their styles,<ref>''Sam & Dave \u2013 An Oral History'' Moore & Marsh, Avon Books 1998 pp 24\u201325,27\u201328</ref> and Moore was also influenced by [[Little Willie John]], whom he and Dave opened for often in the early 1960s.\n\nSam & Dave met working the gospel music circuit, and later in small clubs in Miami during amateur nights in 1961 according to Dave.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Interview with Dave Prater and Dave Booth cover of 1984 ''I Can't Stand Up for Falling Down'' LP</ref> They sang together one night at the King of Hearts club, and started working together immediately thereafter, developing a live act featuring gospel-inspired call-and-response. Soul singer and record producer [[Steve Alaimo]] discovered them while performing during the same show with them at the King of Hearts nightclub in Miami and signed them to [[Marlin Records]].\n\nAfter two singles in early 1962 were released on the local Marlin label owned by Miami's [[Henry Stone]], Stone helped sign them to [[Roulette Records]] in [[New York City]]. They released six 45s from 1962\u20131964 (two were re-releases of Marlin recordings) with Roulette, and one single on Stone and Alaimo's Alston Label. A few of the singles received regional airplay, but did not achieve national chart success. The songs, some of which were produced by [[Steve Alaimo]] and some of which were produced by [[Henry Glover]], were similar in many ways to R&B recordings by Sam Cooke, Jackie Wilson and Little Willie John. Prater was the lead vocalist on most of these singles, with Moore singing harmony and alternate verses.\n\nIn summer 1964, Stone introduced the duo to [[Atlantic Records]]' [[Jerry Wexler]], who signed them to Atlantic.<ref>''Soulville'', Bowman pp 66\u201369</ref> Wexler asked [[Memphis, Tennessee]]-based [[Stax Records]], which Atlantic distributed nationally, to work with Sam & Dave. Wexler wanted the Southern roots and gospel style of their live performances, so the pair were loaned to Stax to record, although they remained [[Atlantic Records]] artists. According to Wexler's autobiography ''Rhythms & Blues'', \"Their live act was filled with animation, harmony and seeming goodwill. I put Sam in the sweet tradition of Sam Cooke or [[Solomon Burke]], while Dave had an ominous [[Four Tops]]' [[Levi Stubbs]]-sounding voice, the preacher promising hellfire.\"\n\n==Stax years (1965\u20131968)==\n\n===Arrival at Stax and early Stax singles===\n[[File:Sam & Dave.png|thumb|right|Sam & Dave in 1966]]\nWhen Sam & Dave arrived at Stax, they worked with producer & engineer [[Jim Stewart (music)|Jim Stewart]] and songwriters including the MGs' guitarist [[Steve Cropper]], who wrote or co-wrote four of their first eight recordings. The duo then moved to relative newcomer writers and producers [[Isaac Hayes]] and [[David Porter (musician)|David Porter]]. Hayes and Porter wrote and produced the duo's biggest hits (although they did not receive production credits until the ''Soul Men'' LP and singles). According to Moore and Prater, they also greatly influenced the duo's singing style,<ref>''Soulsville'', Bowman pp 67\u201369</ref> and shifted their recording style from the style of their Roulette records to a more live, more energetic gospel, call-and-response feel and beat driven soul style the group is known for today.\n\nSam & Dave's Stax records also benefited from the musicians and engineering at Stax. The Stax house band, [[Booker T. & the M.G.'s]], and the Stax horn section, the [[Mar-Keys]], were world-class musicians who co-wrote (often without credit) and contributed to recordings\u2014the same musicians who recorded with [[Otis Redding]], [[Wilson Pickett]], [[Carla Thomas]] and other soul artists. Sam & Dave's Stax recordings through 1967 were engineered by Stax founder [[Jim Stewart (music)|Jim Stewart]], who created the Memphis Sound by recording live in a single take. Stewart is credited for instrumental mixes that allowed for instrumental separation and the distinct contribution of each instrument to the overall feel of the song.\n\nWhile the first two Stax singles failed to chart, the third, the Hayes/Porter composition (with similarities, including the title, to a gospel standard) \"You Don't Know Like I Know\" hit #7 R&B in 1966. This was the first of 10 consecutive Top Twenty R&B chart hits over three years, and 14 R&B chart appearances during their career.\n\n===\"Hold On, I'm Comin{{'\"}} single and ''Hold On, I'm Comin''' LP===\n\"[[Hold On, I'm Comin' (song)|Hold On, I'm Comin']]{{-\"}} (R&B#1/Pop#21), released in March 1966, was an enormous R&B hit for Sam & Dave, and also their first single to break into the Top 40 Pop charts. The song was named the #1 song of the year for 1966 by the ''Billboard'' R&B charts, and spent 20 weeks on the R&B charts in 1966, peaking at #1 in June. In 1988, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' named it one of the best 100 songs of the past 25 years. \"Hold On, I'm Comin{{'\"}} received a belated [[RIAA]] [[music recording sales certification|gold record]] for one million sales in 1995, 29 years after its release.<ref name=\"Soulville Bowman pp 91-92\">''Soulville'' Bowman pp 91\u201392</ref> \"Hold On, I'm Comin{{'\"}} has since been recorded by dozens of other artists.\n\n\"Hold On, I'm Comin{{'\"}} was also the first recording on which Moore took lead on the first verse and Prater was given the response role and second verse at Hayes and Porter's suggestion. The duo used this format (singing dual leads) on most of their songs. The song was created when Hayes called to Porter, who was in the bathroom. Porter supposedly said \"Hold on, man. I'm comin',\" and Hayes and Porter wrote the song within 10 minutes.<ref name=\"Soulville Bowman pp 91-92\"/> \"Hold On, I'm Comin'{{-\"}}, when released, received objections from radio stations over the suggestive title. This resulted in a name change by Stewart and quick re-recording and re-release, and nearly all the original U.S. copies of the single bear the title \"Hold On, I'm A-Comin'\".\n\nThe LP ''[[Hold On, I'm Comin']]'' (4/66) reached #1 for 19 weeks on the R&B album charts in 1966. After Sam & Dave's chart success, Roulette quickly released the album ''Sam & Dave'' in 1966 as well, a collection of the A & B sides of their six Roulette 45s, which did not chart.\n\n===''When Something is Wrong, Double Dynamite'' LP and singles===\nSam & Dave's next huge R&B hit was \"When Something is Wrong With My Baby,\" their only ballad single, which was released in January 1967. Stax author Rob Bowman called this \"One of the most sublime records in soul music's history,\" and Mar-Keys trumpet player Wayne Jackson called it the greatest song he has ever heard. This was the only Sam & Dave hit where Dave sang the first verse solo; their other hits started with Sam & Dave together or Sam singing the first verse. \"When Something is Wrong With My Baby\" has since become an often recorded and performed duet for male and female singers performing together.\n\nThe duo also charted in late 1966 with the top 10 R&B hits  \"Said I Wasn't Gonna Tell Nobody,\" and \"You Got Me Hummin\". These three singles, along with other tracks, were compiled on ''Double Dynamite'' (12/66), Sam & Dave's second LP on Stax. The LP peaked at #7 R&B and #118 Pop.\n\n===\"Soul Man\" single and ''Soul Men'' LP===\nSam & Dave's biggest hit and best-remembered song, \"[[Soul Man (song)|Soul Man]]\" (R&B #1/Pop #2),<ref name=pc51>{{Gilliland|https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19832/m1/ |Show 51 \u2013 The Soul Reformation: Phase three, soul music at the summit. [Part 7&#93; : UNT Digital Library}}</ref> was released in August 1967. It was the number #1 song in the US according to ''Cashbox'' magazine Pop charts in November 1967. Sam & Dave won the [[Grammy Award]] in 1967 for ''\"Best Performance \u2013 Rhythm & Blues Group\"'' for \"Soul Man,\" their first gold record. \"Soul Man\" was voted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] in 1999. The song helped name the emerging music genre as \"Soul Music\". According to co-writer Isaac Hayes, the title was inspired by news reports of soul pride that emerged after the 1967 race riots, where stores that painting the word \"soul\" on your door was a message for looters to bypass your house. Hayes-Porter extrapolated that to \"I'm a soul brother, I'm a soul man.\". It has been recognized as one of the best or most influential songs of 50 years by the Grammy Hall of Fame, The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, ''Rolling Stone'', and R.I.A.A. Songs of the Century. \"Soul Man\" was used as the soundtrack and title for a 1986 film, a 2008 film ''[[Soul Men]]'', a 1997\u20131998 television series. In 2019, \"Soul Man\" was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Andrews |first=Travis M. |date=March 20, 2019 |title=Jay-Z, a speech by Sen.

Critics commented that the B-side \"Wrap It Up\" could have been a separate successful single, which it later became for [[The Fabulous Thunderbirds]]. Because the duo were so busy touring, Hayes & Porter traveled to Europe to record the vocal track on \"Wrap It Up\" in order to release the single. Due to the end of the distribution agreement between Stax and [[Atlantic Records]] in May 1968, \"I Thank You\" was Sam & Dave's final single on Stax. Although they continued to work at Stax with Hayes/Porter, as of May 1968, the duo's work was released on Atlantic Records. \"I Thank You\" sold over one million copies, earning it gold record status.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book\n| first= Joseph\n| last= Murrells\n| year= 1978\n| title= The Book of Golden Discs\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd\n| location= London\n| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/247 247]\n| isbn= 0-214-20512-6\n| url-access= registration\n| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/247\n}}</ref>\n\nSam & Dave's first 1968 single for Atlantic was \"You Don't Know What You Mean to Me,\" written by [[Eddie Floyd]] and [[Steve Cropper]] (R&B #19/Pop #48). Sam & Dave said it was their favorite of their songs.<ref>''Blitz'' magazine \u2013 July 1978, p8</ref> Sam & Dave also released \"Can't You Find Another Way (of Doing It)\" (#20 R&B/#54 Pop), but it was not included in the ''I Thank You'' LP. Their final single of 1968, \"Everybody Got to Believe in Somebody,\" charted in the lower levels of the pop charts and ended Sam & Dave's streak at 10 straight R&B top 20 singles.\n\nThough on Atlantic, the ''I Thank You'' LP (10/68) included 1968 singles initially on both Stax and Atlantic. The LP peaked at #38 on the R&B charts, and was the only LP of their Stax recordings not to chart on the Pop LP charts.<ref>''Soulsville'', Bowman pp 138</ref>\n\n===Sam & Dave's live performances===\nSam & Dave's live act earned them the nickname \"Double Dynamite.\" Phil Walden, Otis Redding's manager, said \"I think Sam & Dave will probably stand the test of time as being the best live act that there ever was. Those guys were absolutely unbelievable. Every night they were awesome.\" An article from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' in October 1968 reads: \"Of all the R&B cats, nobody steams up a place like Sam & Dave ... weaving and dancing (while singing!), they gyrate through enough acrobatics to wear out more than 100 costumes per year.\" Jerri Hershey described in ''Nowhere to Run'': They carried red suits, white suits, three piece lime green suits, all with matching patent boots and coordinated silk hankies woefully inadequate to absorb a soul man's nightly outpourings. Both Sam & Dave talk a lot about sweat. To Dave, its proof that he's worked for his pay. For Sam its essential, almost mystical. He says he cannot work without it.  \"Unless my body reaches a certain temperature, starts to liquefy, I just don't feel right without it.\" Wayne Jackson said Sam & Dave left puddles of sweat onstage by the end of a performance.\n\nIn March 1967, Sam & Dave were co-headliners for the Stax/Volt Revue in Europe, which included [[Booker T & the MGs]], The [[Mar-Keys]], [[Eddie Floyd]], [[Carla Thomas]], [[Arthur Conley]] and headliner [[Otis Redding]]. It was the duo's first trip to Europe. Although Redding headlined the tour, many agreed Sam & Dave stole the show on many nights. According to Redding's and Sam & Dave's manager Phil Walden, Redding refused to be booked on the same bill with Sam & Dave again, not wanting to have to follow their explosive act. A live version of \"Soothe Me\" from Sam & Dave's ''Double Dynamite'' LP was recorded in Paris during the 1967 tour. Released as a single in mid-1967, it continued Sam & Dave's string of top 20 U.S. R&B hits and was their first in the UK Top 40.\n\nAfter the tour, Sam & Dave worked as headliners in the U.S. and in Europe during Fall 1967, Fall 1968 and January 1970, and in Japan in 1969 and 1970. They averaged 280 shows per year from 1967 through 1969 and in 1967, they only took ten days off. Other high points included headlining the [[Expo 67|Montreal World's Fair]] in 1967, performing at the tribute to Martin Luther King, Jr. at Madison Square Garden in June 1968, being the first black soul act to headline the [[Fillmore East]] in December 1968, and headlining the [[Texas International Pop Festival]] for two nights in August 1969. Sam & Dave also performed on U.S. and European television, including two appearances on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1969, appearing on [[The Tonight Show]] and [[American Bandstand]] in 1967, and performing on ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'' in 1969 and 1970. Moore frequently recalls the performances on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' as a career highlight.\n\n==The Atlantic Records years (1968\u20131972)==\n\n===''Best of'' LP, Stax-recorded singles (1969)===\nThe year 1969 started well, with the Atlantic release of ''The Best of Sam & Dave'' LP in January. It contained all of their Stax A sides except \"A Place Nobody Can Find\" and several B-sides, and peaked at #24 on the R&B LP charts and #89 on the Billboard LP charts.<ref>Billboard Charts Online</ref> Their first single of the year, \"Soul Sister, Brown Sugar,\" returned Sam & Dave to the R&B top 20, and was a #15 hit in the UK.<ref>database of UK chart singles:www.everyhit.com</ref> The follow-up \"Born Again,\" reached the lower levels of the charts, and was the last single Sam & Dave recorded at Stax.\n\n===Atlantic produced records, first break-up, and reunion (1969\u20131972)===\nJerry Wexler with co-producer [[Tom Dowd]] tried producing Sam & Dave in New York, with Atlantic songwriters and musicians. It took eight months to issue \"Ooh, Ooh, Ooh\", the first Atlantic single in August 1969.  It was not a very good record, by Sam's own admission, and it represented the first time in four years that a Sam & Dave single failed to chart.\n\nTwo more singles followed in 1970, \"Baby, Baby, Don't Stop Now,\" and \"One Part Love, Two Parts Pain.\" The first was a leftover Hayes-Porter recording from Stax; the second was produced by Wexler and Dowd in New York, and was written by Stax executive [[Al Bell]] and Allen Jones. Both failed to chart. According to Wexler, \"We just made some shit-ass records with them. I never really got into their sensibilities as a producer.\"<ref>''Soulsville'', Bowman pp 140</ref> Wexler then sent the duo south to Muscle Shoals and Miami to work with producers [[Brad Shapiro]] and Dave Crawford for their next single \"Knock It Out The Park,\" which also failed to chart.\n\nSam & Dave split in June 1970, according to Moore<ref name=\"Soul Magazine 1970\">Interview with ''Blues and Soul'' magazine (July 17\u201330, 1970) and later interviews</ref> as a result of Moore's dissatisfaction with the duo and his desire to pursue a career solo. According to Prater, they broke up because \"[Moore] decided to do what he wanted to do on his own.\" Moore recorded three solo singles (none of which charted) for Atlantic over the next year and was preparing an album produced by King Curtis, which was shelved after Curtis was stabbed to death in 1971. Prater recorded a single for Alston. Neither was commercially successful as a solo act, and they reunited in August 1971.\n\nIn October 1971, their last Atlantic single, \"[[Don't Pull Your Love]],\" was a cover of a hit by [[Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds]]. This Shapiro/Crawford production was a minor hit (R&B #36/Pop #102), but not a substantial enough commercial success to keep the duo signed to the label. Sam & Dave recorded four final songs for Atlantic in August, 1972, none of which was released by the label. Their contract with Atlantic expired shortly thereafter.\n\n==Later years (1972\u20131981)==\nDespite inability to attract a major label after Atlantic, there was still demand for public performances, especially in Europe.<ref>''Blues and Soul'' August 6\u201319, 1971 p.6</ref> They toured Turkey in Spring, 1972 and England in Spring, 1973. Sam & Dave also continued to be visible in the U.S., performing on TV shows including ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' and ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]''. According to Sam, most U.S. shows in the 1970s were small clubs, oldies shows, and whatever they could get. He attributed their poor bookings during this period to rumors of drug use and bad blood between the duo.\n\nSam & Dave returned to the studio in 1974 and 1975, recording an album of new songs titled ''Back at Cha'' for United Artists. The album \u2013 their first album of new material in 7 years \u2013 was produced by [[Steve Cropper]], and featured the MGs and The Memphis Horns and had a minor R&B single, \"A Little Bit of Good\" (R&B #89). Songwriters included Cropper, Allen Toussaint, and Jimmy Cliff.<ref>''All Music Guide To Soul'' ed Boganov/Bush/Woodstra/Erlewine 2003 Backbeat Books p.58</ref> Although the LP received positive reviews, it failed to chart. In a side project, they provided vocals on \"Come On, Come Over\" for [[Jaco Pastorius]] for his debut album on Epic in 1976.\n\nIn 1976\u201377, Sam & Dave recorded songs in the UK with producer John Abbey. Two singles were released on Abbey's Contempo label in the UK and Germany, with limited success. Ironically, given the duo's disputes, one of the last singles by Sam & Dave was a cover of [[The Beatles]] \"We Can Work It Out.\" Sam & Dave also briefly retired in 1977, with Dave working at a Pontiac dealership in New Jersey and Sam working at an Austin, Texas, law firm as a process server.\n\nIn 1978, Sam & Dave re-recorded old hits for the LP ''Sweet & Funky Gold'' (Gusto), and re-recorded songs and other soul hits during this period in Nashville for an album for [[K-Tel Records]], ''The Original Soul Man''.<ref>''Sam & Dave \u2013 An Oral History'' p.130</ref> In Summer, 1978, they toured Germany for two weeks.\n\nIn 1979, Sam & Dave enjoyed a significant resurgence of interest as a result of [[Dan Aykroyd]]'s and [[John Belushi]]'s sketch characters ''[[The Blues Brothers]], ''and the comic actors' 1979 top 40 cover of \"Soul Man.\"  Moore stated they were offered an opportunity to perform onstage with Belushi and Aykroyd on ''SNL'' but turned it down when Belushi said Sam & Dave had to perform the intro, then the Blues Brothers would take over.  According to an April 1988 interview with Aykroyd in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]],'' Aykroyd saw Sam & Dave as a teenager at the Montreal Expo in 1967 and said they were one of his biggest influences for creating The Blues Brothers. Aykroyd convinced director [[John Landis]] to include the Jake and Elwood Blues characters listening to \"Hold On, I'm Comin{{'\"}} and \"Soothe Me\" while riding in the Bluesmobile in the 1980 film ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' as a tribute to Sam & Dave.\n\nAlso in 1979, Sam & Dave opened shows for [[The Clash]] on their U.S. tour, including at the [[Palladium (music venue)|Palladium]] in New York City. In 1980, the duo performed in [[Paul Simon]]'s film ''[[One-Trick Pony (film)|One Trick Pony]]'' and, finally, on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. In 1980, they also were featured in a U.S. tour opening for the 1950s revival band [[Sha Na Na]].\n\nIn 1981, they re-recorded many hits along with [[Sam Cooke]] and [[Otis Redding]] covers for LPs titled ''Soul Study Vol. 1'' and ''Soul Study Vol. 2'' (Odyssey). The pair last performed on New Year's Eve, 1981, at the Old Waldorf in San Francisco. According to Moore, when they walked off stage it was the last time they spoke to each other.<ref>''Sam & Dave \u2013 An Oral History'' p.118</ref>\n\n==Dave Prater and Sam Daniels (1982\u20131988)==\nIn 1982, Prater started touring under the \"Sam & Dave\" name or as \"The New Sam & Dave Revue\" with Sam Daniels, who performed with Dave from October 1982 until Dave's death in 1988. Moore attempted to block Prater from using the group's name,<ref>''San Diego Union Tribune'' 9/25/85 \"Singer Finds Sour Note in New Duo's Name\" PP B1</ref> but was largely unsuccessful. The Daniels & Prater incarnation played 100 shows per year over the next seven years, including in Europe, Japan and Canada.\n\nIn 1983, Sam & Dave called on [[Billy Davis (guitarist)|J.C. \"Billy\" Davis]] to put together a band to back them at a concert at [[Pine Knob]], in [[Clarkston, Michigan]] where they were opening for [[James Brown]].<ref>[http://theconcertdatabase.com/concerts/james-brown-27 ''Date: 08/13/1983, Venue: Pine Knob Music Theater, Featured Artist(s): James Brown, Bo Diddley, Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes, Sam & Dave'' at theconcertdatabase]</ref>\n\nIn 1985, Prater and Sam Daniels released a newly sung medley of Sam & Dave hits recorded in The Netherlands, which peaked at #92 on the R&B chart and was credited to \"Sam & Dave\". Sam Moore got the record company to recall the single for using the \"Sam & Dave\" name without permission, and the record was re-labelled and re-issued by \"The New Sam & Dave Revue\".<ref>Congressional Testimony 5/21/1998 \"Protection Against Artistic Knock-Off's:Sam Moore\"</ref>\n\nPrater last performed with Sam Daniels on April 3, 1988 at a Stax Reunion at the Atlanta Civic Center, which also featured Isaac Hayes, Eddie Floyd, and Rufus and Carla Thomas. Six days later, on April 9, 1988, Prater died in a car crash in Sycamore, Georgia while driving to his mother's house.\n\n==Sam Moore solo career (1982\u2013present)==\nMoore has continued to perform and record as a solo artist, and has also performed in numerous duets with other popular artists. (See the [[Sam Moore]] article.)\n\n==Conflict between Moore and Prater==\nSam & Dave were also famous for having a very tumultuous partnership during most of their 21 years together. According to Moore, they did not speak to each other offstage for almost 13 years. During the 1970s, they broke up many times, and typically would show up separately for shows, require separate dressing rooms, not look at each other onstage, and communicate through intermediaries.<ref>Jeri Hirshey from book ''Nowhere to Run''</ref> They also had performances in the 1970s where only one of them would show up. Moore describes personal issues with Prater, drug use, touring fatigue, and a desire to do his own act with new material as contributing to their break-up.<ref name=\"Soul Magazine 1970\"/> Prater attributed their rift and break-ups to Moore's frustrations in wanting to do his own act and diversify from repeatedly performing the Sam & Dave song catalog (which Prater has said that Moore didn't like very much).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Covers by other artists/use in pop culture==\nSam & Dave songs have been recorded by other artists, including 29 covers of \"Hold On, I'm Comin'.\" Others who charted with Sam & Dave songs include [[ZZ Top]] -\"I Thank You,\" [[The Fabulous Thunderbirds]] -\"Wrap It Up,\" [[James & Bobby Purify]] -\"I Take What I Want,\" [[Linda Ronstadt]] featuring [[Aaron Neville]] -\"When Something Is Wrong with My Baby,\" [[Chuck Jackson]] & [[Maxine Brown (soul singer)|Maxine Brown]] -\"Hold On, I'm Comin',\" [[Elvis Costello]] \u2013 \"I Can't Stand Up for Falling Down\" and [[Lydia Pense]] & [[Cold Blood (band)|Cold Blood]] -\"I Take What I Want.\" A diverse group of other successful artists also recorded Sam & Dave covers including: [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Peter Frampton]], [[The Temptations]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Jackie Wilson]], [[Eurythmics]], [[Rory Gallagher]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], [[The Band]], [[Martha Reeves & the Vandellas]], [[Michael Bolton]], [[Patti LaBelle]] & [[Travis Tritt]], [[Bryan Ferry]], [[Marilyn McCoo]] & [[Billy Davis Jr.]], [[The Hollies]], [[Paul Butterfield]], [[Taj Mahal (musician)]], [[Guy Sebastian]], and [[Eric Clapton]] & [[B.B. King]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.secondhandsongs.com |title=Home |publisher=SecondHandSongs |date= |accessdate=2014-04-23}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, the [[Stax Museum]] of American Soul Music opened in Memphis, and Sam & Dave are in the film made for the museum, titled ''Soulsville'', and they have a permanent wall-and-video display.\n\n[[Barack Obama]] used \"Hold On, I'm Comin{{'\"}} as a theme song on the campaign trail until Sam Moore requested that he stop using it. Eleven months later, Sam Moore performed \"Soul Man\" with [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and Elvis Costello at one of Obama's inaugural parties. A parody of \"Soul Man\" created by Moore, \"I'm a Dole Man,\" was used in the 1996 [[Bob Dole]] presidential campaign until the copyright owners objected and requested the campaign stop using it. Sam & Dave released the rare single \"Hold On, Edwin's Coming\" in 1982 to support Louisiana Governor [[Edwin Edwards]]' third run for governor. Another parody, \"I'm a Suns Fan,\" was recorded by Moore and used for the [[Phoenix Suns]] basketball games.\n\nSam & Dave songs have been used frequently in movie and TV soundtracks and commercials, including \"Hold On, I'm Comin{{'\"}} on the soundtrack of the 2007 hit film ''[[American Gangster (film)|American Gangster]]''. \"Hold On, I'm Comin{{'\"}} and \"Soothe Me\" played on the radio and 8 track player (album titled: \"The Best of Sam & Dave\") in the Bluesmobile during the 1980 hit movie ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]''. \"A Place Nobody Can Find\" was used in the background of a scene in HBO's series ''The Wire''. [[Jay Leno]] used \"Hold On, I'm Comin\" while driving his AC Cobra on his 2009 Super Bowl commercial to announce his show's move to a new time. \"Wrap It Up\" was used as a transition to commercial break for ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]''. \"Soul Man\" was used as the title and title track in the 1986 movie featuring C. Thomas Howell, and also the 1997\u20131998 television series featuring Dan Aykroyd. The movie ''[[Tapeheads]]'', released in 1988 and starring [[John Cusack]] and [[Tim Robbins]], featured Sam Moore and Junior Walker as a fictitious, legendary soul duo called The Swanky Modes.\n\nThe movie ''[[Soul Men]]'', released in November 2008, was a comedy featuring [[Bernie Mac]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]] as two feuding soul singers called \"The Real Deal.\" In February 2009, Moore filed suit against the film production company ([[Weinstein Company|The Weinstein Company]]) and the producers for infringing on the marks \"Soul Man\" and \"Soul Men,\" claiming the movie is based on the careers of Sam & Dave, and damaged both Moore's reputation and career. The suit was dismissed on summary judgment in May 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=How the Weinsteins Beat 'Soul Man' Singer Sam Moore in an Important Lawsuit|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/weinstein-sam-moore-lawsuit-330072|first=Eriq |last=Gardner|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=2012-05-29|accessdate=2013-03-22}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Sam & Dave discography}}\n\n*1966: ''[[Hold On, I'm Comin']]'' (Stax) (POP #45, R&B #1)\n*1966: ''Double Dynamite''  (Stax) (POP #118, R&B #7)\n*1967: ''[[Soul Men (album)|Soul Men]]'' (Stax) (POP #2, R&B #5)\n*1968: ''I Thank You'' (Atlantic) (R&B #38)\n*1975: ''Back at Cha'' (United Artists)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n{{commons category|Sam and Dave}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.sammoore.net/ Sam Moore's website]\n\n{{Sam & Dave}}\n{{Stax Records}}\n{{1992 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sam and Dave}}\n[[Category:American soul musical groups]]\n[[Category:African-American musical groups]]\n[[Category:American musical duos]]\n[[Category:Rhythm and blues duos]]\n[[Category:Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award winners]]\n[[Category:Atlantic Records artists]]\n[[Category:American soul musicians]]\n", "name_user": "2600:100b:b11c:be7f:953a:f57b:1e18:4a04", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Fixed typo)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_%26_Dave"}
