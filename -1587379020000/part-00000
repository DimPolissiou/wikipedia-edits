Delwara was originally known as \u2018Devkul Patan Nagri\u2019 (\u0926\u0947\u0935\u0915\u0941\u0932 \u092a\u093e\u091f\u0928 \u0928\u0917\u0930\u0940) which means the town of god. It boasted of over 1500 temples at one time, out of which there were over 400 [[Jain temples]]. Delwara was the center of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Around middle of 13<sup>th</sup> century, Raja Sagar, a Deora Chauhan and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal of [[Jalore]] was a very brave king of Delwara (Mewar). Descendants of Raja Sagar sacrificed their lives whilst fighting alongside Ranas of [[Mewar]] against [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent|Muslim]] invaders. Raja Sagar was the progenitor of Bachhawat clan of Oswals. Sagar's son, Kunwar Bohitya was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.&nbsp; Samdhar, a grandson of Bohitya and a Deora [[Chauhan]], was the first man in his genealogy to convert to [[Jainism]].\n\n== Historical & Spiritual Background of Temple Town ==\nThe ancient [[Jain temples]] of Delwara, now in total ruins, are believed to have been built during the reign of Samrat [[Samprati]] (224-215 BC). He was grandson of Samrat Ashoka and son of Ashoka's blind son Kunal. [[Samprati]] became the Emperor of entire western and southern part of [[India]] ([[Maurya Empire]]) and ruled from [[Ujjain]]. It is said that [[Samprati]], also known as \u2018Jain Ashoka\u2019, built thousands of [[Jain temples]] in India. It may be noted that all the ancient Jain monuments of Rajasthan and Gujarat, including the [[Jain temples]] at Delwara (Mewar), are also attributed to Samrat [[Samprati]].\n\n=== City of learning and education ===\nDelwara, Nagda and Aahar (Ayad) were the centers of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Most princes of Mewar and adjoining kingdoms were groomed in the art of warfare and formal education at Delwara. Hence it was also known as Kunwarpada \u2013 center of learning. Delwara was a large town and spread from Gandharva Sagar Lake to [[Nagda]]. Today only 25% of the original town remains.<ref name=\"Prof Harak Lal Pamecha 2013\">Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref>\n\n=== Grandeur of Jain temples ===\nAs on 2017, three main [[Jain temples]] remain in Delwara, for which good restoration work has been undertaken. Two of the temples are of [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] (\u090b\u0937\u092d\u0926\u0947\u0935 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928) and one of [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]] (\u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0928\u093e\u0925 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928). [[Jain temples]] at Delwara were built with white marble stones. Despite being plain and austere on outside, the interiors of all these temples are covered with delicate carvings. Each has a walled courtyard called Rang Mandap. In the center of the courtyard is the shrine with the image of the deity, [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] and [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]], respectively. Around the large courtyard, there are numerous small shrines, each housing a beautiful sculpture of the 24 [[Tirthankara]] (\u0924\u0940\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902\u0915\u0930) with a series of elegantly carved pillars from the entrance to the courtyard. The special feature of these temples is its ceiling, which is circular in eleven richly carved concentric rings. The central ceiling of the temple is adorned with magnificent carving and it culminates into ornamented central pendant. The pendant of the domes tapers down forming a drop or point, like a lotus flower. This is an astonishing piece of work. It symbolizes the divine grace coming down to fulfill human aspirations. The figure of sixteen goddesses of knowledge, (\u0935\u093f\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0926\u0947\u0935\u0940)  are carved on the ceiling. \n<br/>\n{{multiple image\n| align = center\n| caption_align = center\n| total_width = 1000\n| image1 = Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara - Entrance.jpg\n| alt1 = Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara - entrance (2015)\n| link1 = Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara - Entrance.jpg\n| caption1 = '''Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara - entrance (2015)'''\n| image2 = Adeshwar Jain Temple at Delwara (2015) - Central dome with Vidhya Devies.jpg\n| alt2 = Central dome with Vidhya Devies (2015)\n| link2 = Adeshwar Jain Temple at Delwara (2015) - Central dome with Vidhya Devies.jpg\n| caption2 = '''Central dome with Vidhya Devies (2015)'''\n| image3 = Adeshwar Jain Temple at Delwara (2015).jpg\n| alt3 = Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara (2015)\n| link3 = Adeshwar Jain Temple at Delwara (2015).jpg\n| caption3 = '''Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara (2015)'''\n| direction = \n}}\n<br/>\n\n=== Why [[Jain temples]] at [[Mt. Abu]] are called [[Dilwara Temples]] (\u0926\u0947\u0932\u0935\u093e\u0921\u093e \u091c\u0948\u0928 \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930)? <ref>Prof Roshan Jain, Principal, Pannadhai B.Ed. Collage, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><ref>Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref> ===\nThere is a story that the minsters of the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] rulers of [[Gujarat]] visited these temples during 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> centuries AD and were much impressed with the architecture and carving of the temples. At the request of these visiting ministers, then rulers of Delwara (Mewar), provided the design and drawings of the [[Jain temples]]. Vimal Shah, minister, governor of [[Chandravati]] and commander-in-chief of [[Bhima I|Bhimadev I]] (1022\u201364), the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] ruler of Gujarat,came to Delwara. He was inspired by Jain Acharya to wash out his sins perpetrated in the battle fields, hence constructed a temple near [[Mount Abu]] which was the replication of Delwara (Mewar) Jain temple. \n\nThe temple is known as [[Vimal Vasahi]] (Shri Adinath temple). He was remorseful and spent the rest of his life in religious discourse at [[Chandravati]] (near Abu road). Later, in 1230 AD, the two Porwad brothers \u2013 [[Vastupala|Vastupal]] and Tejpal, both ministers of the [[Vaghela dynasty|Vaghela]] ruler of Gujarat, came to Delwara. They also built the [[Jain temples]] designed after [[Vimal Vasahi]] temples near Abu. Since these five temples, built between 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> century at Abu, are similar in design and architecture to the ones at Delwara (Mewar), came to be known as [[Dilwara Temples]] (\u0926\u0947\u0932\u0935\u093e\u0921\u093e \u091c\u0948\u0928 \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930). These temples are a composite cluster of five temples, with their own unique identity. Each is named after the small village in which it is located. The grandeur of sculptured marble, exquisite carvings of ceilings, domes, pillars and arches of the temple which is beyond anyone's expectations, is far superior to the originals at Delwara ([[Mewar]]). \n\n== Songara and Deora Chauhans in Mewar ==\nThe Chauhan clan of Rajputs, ruled over a large area of South Western Rajasthan and Gujarat. Alhana, younger son of Wakpati Rao Chauhan, seized [[Nadol]] (near [[Jodhpur]]) from the [[Paramara dynasty|Paramaras]] and established himself there toward the end of the 10<sup>th</sup> century. His descendant, Kirtipal (Keytu) was driven from Nadol by Sultan [[Qutb al-Din Aibak|Qutbud-din Aibak]] of Delhi, during the 12<sup>th</sup> century. Kirtipal, then journeyed further to the south-west to [[Bhinmal]] and [[Sanchore|Sanchor]], before seizing [[Jalore]] from the Paramaras. Some of his descendants were known as Sanchora Chauhans. Rao Kirtipal, the youngest son of Alhana, ruler of [[Nadol]], is the founder of the [[Jalore]] line of Chauhans. He captured it from the Paramaras in 1181. Kirtipal was progenitor of [[Songara]] clan of Chauhans. He died in 1182 and was succeeded by his son Samar Singh.<ref name=\":0\">Dr Mohanlal Gupta. Jalore ka Rajnitik Evem Sanskritik Itihas (Hindi). Shubhda Prakash, Jodhpur</ref>\n\nChauhans have 24 major sects - Hada, Songara, Deora, Khichi, Shambhri, Sanchora, Pavia, Goyalwal, Bhadauria, Malani, Nirwan, Puravia, Madrecha, Cheeba, Mohil, Chahil, Balecha, Chachera, Boda, Nadola, Nikumbh,..etc. It is said that Rao Bisaldeo was the progenitor of the Deora clan. Prithviraj Chauhan III was nephew of Rao Bisaldeo. In ages past, the rulers of [[Jalore]], [[Chandravati]] and [[Sirohi State|Sirohi]] belonged to the Songara and Deora clans.\n[[File:Extract of diary of Mathuranath Purohit .jpg|thumb|294x294px|Extract from diary of Mathuranath Purohit]]\n\n\nIt is said that around 1172\u201380, King of Jalore, Rao Kirtipal (Keytu, a Songara Chauhan), captured Ahar (now Ayad), then capital of Mewar, from Rawal Samant Singh. In 1172, Rawal Samant Singh of Mewar was forced to move his capital from Ahar to [[Dungarpur State|Dungarpur]]. Samant Singh and his younger brother Kumar Singh ruled from Dungarpur.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mewar#cite_note-Naravane-1 Mewar - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, Ahar and the adjoining area of Mewar, was ruled by Songara / Deora Chauhans for few years, till they were recovered by Rawal Kumar Singh. Interregnum, the brothers and cousins of Songara / Deora Chauhans were perhaps given the Jagirs in the Girva \u2013 the villages surrounded by Aravalli hills of the present-day Udaipur city. [[Jagir|Jagirdars]] of Girva were called Raja. There is no historical record or manuscript of Mewar / Jalore state narrating that Rawal Samant Singh was dislodged by Keytu of Jalore.  However, the extract of personal dairy written in 1939 by Mathuranath Purohit, Master of Ceremonies, Mewar, states,<ref>Dr Rajendranath Purohit, Senior Research Fellow, Oriental Institute of Research, Udaipur (2013) \u2013 in conversation with.</ref><blockquote>''\u201cKeytu Chauhan, the King of Nadol snatched Ahar from Samant Singh, after defeating him in a battle.

Also, according to local dialect the village of Debari, adjacent to Berwas, means Deora-ki-Bari, meaning \u2018Window to Deora Kingdom\u2019. However, according to Mewar's eminent historian and writer, Dr Shri Krishan Jugnu, \u201cDebari means window to God\u2019s kingdom (Dev-bari)\u201d. There, is an inscription put up in 1975 during renovation of Ashapura Mata temple, \u201cTemple of the Kul Deity (family idol) of Deora Chauhans was initially made by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528\u201d (during the times of Maharana Ratan Singh II, 1528\u20131531). To date the temple is managed by Deora Chauhans. \n\nThe Udaipur Girva too has number of villages which are inhabited by Deora Chauhans. There are many families of Deora Chauhans in Delwara, which is very close to Udaipur and on the periphery of Girva. It is therefore, quite possible that one Raja Sagar, fourth son of Rao Samant Singh of Jalore and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal, was bestowed the Jagir of Delwara during mid-13<sup>th</sup> century. It is believed that later Maharana Udai Singh II (1540\u20131572), annexed these Jagirs from Deora Chauhans to move his capital from Chittor to Udaipur when he lost Chittor to Akbar in 1568.<br>\nEminent historian, Rai Bahadur [[Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha|Gaurishankar Ojha]] writes,<ref>Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar H Ojha (2015).

It is believed that he was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Bhanwarlal Nahata (2009). Mantri Karam Chand Bachhawat. Prakrit Bharati Academy, Jaipur; BJ Nahata Foundation, Calcutta.</ref>\n\nOne day while Bohitya was asleep in his palace, a snake climbed the bed and bit him on his legs. After biting, the snake hit the prince with his tail and descended from the bed. Prince got up with fright and asked for help. There was commotion in the palace and Raja Sagar came to know of it. The Raja asked the prince, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d The prince replied, \u201cSnake has bitten me\u201d. Raja tried to save him but in vain. People looked around for the snake but couldn't find one. The prince's leg became blue and body turned cold. Knowing that the prince was dead, they took him for the final journey of cremation. At that time the disciples (bhattarack) of Acharya Jindutt Suriji who were out for \u2018Gochari\u2019 (collecting food and alms) saw the funeral procession of the prince. They started discussing among themselves. One disciple said, \u201cThe prince is not dead. Why are they taking him for cremation?\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe Mantri of Raja Sagar, who was passing by, heard the conversation and informed the King. Thus, the life of Prince Bohitya was saved and he was brought back to the palace. Since then Bohitya and his family developed deep faith in Jainism and started paying obeisance to Jain Acharyas and their disciples in Delwara. Bahrang Devi, wife of Raja Bohitya, was a beautiful and talented lady and lived in Delwara. She had eight sons - Shree Karan, Jaiso, Jaimal, Nanha, Bhima, Padam, Somji and Pushmal.

Khilji seized the Fort of Chittor and the fort was made over to Rao Maldeo, son of Rao Samant Singh, a Chauhan Chief in Jalore for governance. Incidentally, Rao Maldeo was uncle of Raja Bohitya. \n\nBoth Rana Ratan Singh I and his cousin Rawal Laksh (Lakshman Singh) were killed in the battle. Raja Bohitya too sacrificed his life in the battle, while fighting alongside Rana Ratan Singh I against Allauddin Khilji in 1303. Later Maharana Hamir Singh I (1326\u201364), successor of Sisodia clan, married the daughter of Rao Maldeo.<ref>Lalit K. Mehta (1999) Caste, Clan, and Ethnicity: A Study of Mehtas in Rajasthan. Rawat Publications.</ref>\n\n=== Rana Shree Karan Sacrifices his Life for Mewar ===\nAfter Raja Bohitya, his eldest son Raja Shree Karan ascended to the throne of Delwara. Shree Karan was a kind-hearted king. Raja Shree Karan won Machindragarh (present day village Machind near [[Kumbhalgarh]]) in a battle and was bestowed the title of Rana. At one time around mid-14<sup>th</sup> Century the soldiers of Rana Shree Karan looted the treasury of [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Sultan Muhammad Bin Tughluk]] (1325-51) while his army was on a passage through Aravalli's from Delhi to  Gujarat.<ref>Lakshman Singh Mehta (1983).

Sultan [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Muhammad Bin Tughluk]] of Delhi brought in large army to recapture Chittor Fort, but he was defeated by the army of Maharana Hamir Singh I and taken prisoner at Singoli, near [[Mandalgarh]]. Rana Shree Karan was killed in the battle while assisting Maharana Hamir Singh I. Muhammad Bin Tughlug was released after paying 50 lakh Rupees, 100 elephants and several districts. But he died in 1351 at Delhi. Mewar established their supremacy within 50 years of the sack of Chittorgarh and Maharana Hamir Singh I recaptured the Fort in 1353.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar H Ojha (2015).

Samdhar, a Deora Chauhan, was the first man in his genealogy to convert to Jainism from the saint and scholar of Khartargachh, Shree Jineshwar Suri Maharaj. Thereafter his descendants became merged in the premier merchant community of Oswals and established matrimonial relation with Jain-Oswal community. He chose Bohotra (Bothra) as the name for his clan on the name of his grandfather Bohitya. Samdhar and all his brothers became the followers of Jainism and organised sangh yatra. Thus, he received the title of Sanghpati. Samdhar was blessed by a son named Tejpal.\u201d<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\" />''</blockquote>After the death of Bothra Samdhar, Tejpal became Sanghpati. He gifted gold, horses, elephants, etc. to the King of [[Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty|Gurjar]] \u2013 [[Patan, Gujarat|Patan]] ([[Anhilpur]]) and the King pleased with his friendship gifted him some part of his region to administer. He successfully ruled the people and helped the poor and needy by providing alms. Tejpal was blessed with a son -Vilha, from his wife Tara Devi.Later on, Tejpal took santhara (fast until death - left all food) and died. After his death, Vilha became Sanghpati. He was very rich but also very philanthropic. He gave generous donations, especially for Jain religion and honoured the sadhvis and shravaks. He had three sons - Kadua, Dharma and Nanda. After Vilha's death, his elder son Kadua became Sanghpati and went to [[Chittorgarh]] to settle down. Later his descendant, Bothra Bachhraj became [[Dewan]] of [[Jodhpur State|Jodhpur]] and founding Dewan of [[Bikaner State|Bikaner.]] Bachhraj's descendants were known as Bachhawats.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n==Delwara after Deora Chauhans==\nLater, in 15th century, the Kingdom of [[Mewar dynasty|Mewar]] was divided into 16 first grade thikanas or districts. Delwara was one of the 16 Rajwadas, along with [[Bari Sadri|Badi Sadri]] and [[Gogunda]]. Delwara has been ruled by Jhala Rajputs from 15<sup>th</sup> Century onwards. The ancestor of the Jhala family was Raj Sahib Raidharji Vogohoji of [[Dhrangadhra State|Dhrangadhara]] ([[Dhrangadhra State|Halvad]]), son of Harpal Makwana. During the reign of Maharana Raimal (1473\u20131509), Ajoji (Ajja Singh Jhala) the deposed son of Raj Sahib Raidharji, along with his brother Sajoji (Sajja Singh Jhala) came to Mewar. Jhalas performed meritorious service in Mewar. Later the Maharana granted the Jagir of Delwara to Kunwar Sajja and that of Bari Sadri to Kunwar Ajja Singh and were granted the title of Raj Rana. \n\nAjja fought alongside [[Rana Sanga|Maharana Sangram Singh]] I (1509\u20131527) against [[Babur]] in 1527 at the [[Battle of Khanwa]]. When Maharana Sangram Singh ([[Rana Sanga]]) was wounded on the battlefield, Ajja donned the Maharana's tunic, which kept the Mewar army together but proved fatal for Raj Rana Ajja, who died in the battle. As many as 7 generations of the Jhala family had been sacrificing their lives for Maharanas of Mewar.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /> \n\nWho ruled Delwara after Deora Chauhans left in 14<sup>th</sup> century till Jhalas came in 15<sup>th</sup> century? There is an inscription plate of 1975, that Ashapura Temple at Berwas (near Debari) was built by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528. Who were the ancestors of Munjerao? Were they descendants of Raja Sagar? It is yet to be researched and established.\n{{scalable image|Table 1 - Genealogical Tree - Deora Chauhans Dynasty.jpg|3500px|Genealogical Tree - Deora Chauhan Dynasty at Jaolore, Sirohi and Delwara in Rajasthan|alt=Genealogical Tree - Deora Chauhan Dynasty at Jaolore, Sirohi and Delwara in Rajasthan|tooltip=no}}\n<br>\n\n== Delightful places <ref>https://wikitravel.org/en/Delwara</ref> ==\n'''Devi Garh Palace''' - This 18th century palace in the village of Delwara has undergone years of restoration and rebuilding.

Delwara was originally known as \u2018Devkul Patan Nagri\u2019 (\u0926\u0947\u0935\u0915\u0941\u0932 \u092a\u093e\u091f\u0928 \u0928\u0917\u0930\u0940) which means the town of god. It boasted of over 1500 temples at one time, out of which there were over 400 [[Jain temples]]. Delwara was the center of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Around middle of 13<sup>th</sup> century, Raja Sagar, a Deora Chauhan and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal of [[Jalore]] was a very brave king of Delwara (Mewar). Descendants of Raja Sagar sacrificed their lives whilst fighting alongside Ranas of [[Mewar]] against [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent|Muslim]] invaders. Raja Sagar was the progenitor of Bachhawat clan of Oswals. Sagar's son, Kunwar Bohitya was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.&nbsp; Samdhar, a grandson of Bohitya and a Deora [[Chauhan]], was the first man in his genealogy to convert to [[Jainism]].\n\n== Historical & Spiritual Background of Temple Town ==\nThe ancient [[Jain temples]] of Delwara, now in total ruins, are believed to have been built during the reign of Samrat [[Samprati]] (224-215 BC). He was grandson of Samrat Ashoka and son of Ashoka's blind son Kunal. [[Samprati]] became the Emperor of entire western and southern part of [[India]] ([[Maurya Empire]]) and ruled from [[Ujjain]]. It is said that [[Samprati]], also known as \u2018Jain Ashoka\u2019, built thousands of [[Jain temples]] in India. It may be noted that all the ancient Jain monuments of Rajasthan and Gujarat, including the [[Jain temples]] at Delwara (Mewar), are also attributed to Samrat [[Samprati]].\n\n=== City of learning and education ===\nDelwara, Nagda and Aahar (Ayad) were the centers of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Most princes of Mewar and adjoining kingdoms were groomed in the art of warfare and formal education at Delwara. Hence it was also known as Kunwarpada \u2013 center of learning. Delwara was a large town and spread from Gandharva Sagar Lake to [[Nagda]]. Today only 25% of the original town remains.<ref name=\"Prof Harak Lal Pamecha 2013\">Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref>\n\n=== Grandeur of Jain temples ===\nAs on 2017, three main [[Jain temples]] remain in Delwara, for which good restoration work has been undertaken. Two of the temples are of [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] (\u090b\u0937\u092d\u0926\u0947\u0935 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928) and one of [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]] (\u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0928\u093e\u0925 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928). [[Jain temples]] at Delwara were built with white marble stones. Despite being plain and austere on outside, the interiors of all these temples are covered with delicate carvings. Each has a walled courtyard called Rang Mandap. In the center of the courtyard is the shrine with the image of the deity, [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] and [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]], respectively. Around the large courtyard, there are numerous small shrines, each housing a beautiful sculpture of the 24 [[Tirthankara]] (\u0924\u0940\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902\u0915\u0930) with a series of elegantly carved pillars from the entrance to the courtyard. The special feature of these temples is its ceiling, which is circular in eleven richly carved concentric rings. The central ceiling of the temple is adorned with magnificent carving and it culminates into ornamented central pendant. The pendant of the domes tapers down forming a drop or point, like a lotus flower. This is an astonishing piece of work. It symbolizes the divine grace coming down to fulfill human aspirations. The figure of sixteen goddesses of knowledge, (\u0935\u093f\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0926\u0947\u0935\u0940)  are carved on the ceiling. \n<br/>\n{{multiple image\n| align = center\n| caption_align = center\n| total_width = 1000\n| image1 = Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara - Entrance.jpg\n| alt1 = Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara - entrance (2015)\n| link1 = Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara - Entrance.jpg\n| caption1 = '''Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara - entrance (2015)'''\n| image2 = Adeshwar Jain Temple at Delwara (2015) - Central dome with Vidhya Devies.jpg\n| alt2 = Central dome with Vidhya Devies (2015)\n| link2 = Adeshwar Jain Temple at Delwara (2015) - Central dome with Vidhya Devies.jpg\n| caption2 = '''Central dome with Vidhya Devies (2015)'''\n| image3 = Adeshwar Jain Temple at Delwara (2015).jpg\n| alt3 = Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara (2015)\n| link3 = Adeshwar Jain Temple at Delwara (2015).jpg\n| caption3 = '''Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara (2015)'''\n| direction = \n}}\n<br/>\n\n=== Why [[Jain temples]] at [[Mt.

Collage, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><ref>Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref> ===\nThere is a story that the minsters of the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] rulers of [[Gujarat]] visited these temples during 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> centuries AD and were much impressed with the architecture and carving of the temples. At the request of these visiting ministers, then rulers of Delwara (Mewar), provided the design and drawings of the [[Jain temples]]. Vimal Shah, minister, governor of [[Chandravati]] and commander-in-chief of [[Bhima I|Bhimadev I]] (1022\u201364), the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] ruler of Gujarat,came to Delwara. He was inspired by Jain Acharya to wash out his sins perpetrated in the battle fields, hence constructed a temple near [[Mount Abu]] which was the replication of Delwara (Mewar) Jain temple. \n\nThe temple is known as [[Vimal Vasahi]] (Shri Adinath temple). He was remorseful and spent the rest of his life in religious discourse at [[Chandravati]] (near Abu road). Later, in 1230 AD, the two Porwad brothers \u2013 [[Vastupala|Vastupal]] and Tejpal, both ministers of the [[Vaghela dynasty|Vaghela]] ruler of Gujarat, came to Delwara. They also built the [[Jain temples]] designed after [[Vimal Vasahi]] temples near Abu. Since these five temples, built between 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> century at Abu, are similar in design and architecture to the ones at Delwara (Mewar), came to be known as [[Dilwara Temples]] (\u0926\u0947\u0932\u0935\u093e\u0921\u093e \u091c\u0948\u0928 \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930). These temples are a composite cluster of five temples, with their own unique identity. Each is named after the small village in which it is located. The grandeur of sculptured marble, exquisite carvings of ceilings, domes, pillars and arches of the temple which is beyond anyone's expectations, is far superior to the originals at Delwara ([[Mewar]]). \n\n== Songara and Deora Chauhans in Mewar ==\nThe Chauhan clan of Rajputs, ruled over a large area of South Western Rajasthan and Gujarat. Alhana, younger son of Wakpati Rao Chauhan, seized [[Nadol]] (near [[Jodhpur]]) from the [[Paramara dynasty|Paramaras]] and established himself there toward the end of the 10<sup>th</sup> century. His descendant, Kirtipal (Keytu) was driven from Nadol by Sultan [[Qutb al-Din Aibak|Qutbud-din Aibak]] of Delhi, during the 12<sup>th</sup> century. Kirtipal, then journeyed further to the south-west to [[Bhinmal]] and [[Sanchore|Sanchor]], before seizing [[Jalore]] from the Paramaras. Some of his descendants were known as Sanchora Chauhans. Rao Kirtipal, the youngest son of Alhana, ruler of [[Nadol]], is the founder of the [[Jalore]] line of Chauhans. He captured it from the Paramaras in 1181. Kirtipal was progenitor of [[Songara]] clan of Chauhans. He died in 1182 and was succeeded by his son Samar Singh.<ref name=\":0\">Dr Mohanlal Gupta.

Prithviraj Chauhan III was nephew of Rao Bisaldeo. In ages past, the rulers of [[Jalore]], [[Chandravati]] and [[Sirohi State|Sirohi]] belonged to the Songara and Deora clans.\n[[File:Extract of diary of Mathuranath Purohit .jpg|thumb|294x294px|Extract from diary of Mathuranath Purohit]]\n\n\nIt is said that around 1172\u201380, King of Jalore, Rao Kirtipal (Keytu, a Songara Chauhan), captured Ahar (now Ayad), then capital of Mewar, from Rawal Samant Singh. In 1172, Rawal Samant Singh of Mewar was forced to move his capital from Ahar to [[Dungarpur State|Dungarpur]]. Samant Singh and his younger brother Kumar Singh ruled from Dungarpur.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mewar#cite_note-Naravane-1 Mewar - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, Ahar and the adjoining area of Mewar, was ruled by Songara / Deora Chauhans for few years, till they were recovered by Rawal Kumar Singh. Interregnum, the brothers and cousins of Songara / Deora Chauhans were perhaps given the Jagirs in the Girva \u2013 the villages surrounded by Aravalli hills of the present-day Udaipur city. [[Jagir|Jagirdars]] of Girva were called Raja. There is no historical record or manuscript of Mewar / Jalore state narrating that Rawal Samant Singh was dislodged by Keytu of Jalore.

Also, according to local dialect the village of Debari, adjacent to Berwas, means Deora-ki-Bari, meaning \u2018Window to Deora Kingdom\u2019. However, according to Mewar's eminent historian and writer, Dr Shri Krishan Jugnu, \u201cDebari means window to God\u2019s kingdom (Dev-bari)\u201d. There, is an inscription put up in 1975 during renovation of Ashapura Mata temple, \u201cTemple of the Kul Deity (family idol) of Deora Chauhans was initially made by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528\u201d (during the times of Maharana Ratan Singh II, 1528\u20131531). To date the temple is managed by Deora Chauhans. \n\nThe Udaipur Girva too has number of villages which are inhabited by Deora Chauhans. There are many families of Deora Chauhans in Delwara, which is very close to Udaipur and on the periphery of Girva. It is therefore, quite possible that one Raja Sagar, fourth son of Rao Samant Singh of Jalore and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal, was bestowed the Jagir of Delwara during mid-13<sup>th</sup> century. It is believed that later Maharana Udai Singh II (1540\u20131572), annexed these Jagirs from Deora Chauhans to move his capital from Chittor to Udaipur when he lost Chittor to Akbar in 1568.<br>\nEminent historian, Rai Bahadur [[Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha|Gaurishankar Ojha]] writes,<ref>Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar H Ojha (2015).

Rao Kanhadeo and his son Kunwar [[Viramadeva|Viramdeo]] were killed in a battle against [[Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Jalore|Alauddin Khalji]] in 1311, while Rao Maldeo and Rao Raningdeo ruled smaller Jagirs in Jalore. It is believed that Rao Sagar was given the Jagir of Delwara, as the adjoining areas of Girva (Udaipur) were ruled by Deora Chauhans until 14-15<sup>th</sup> century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/britishraj/Tod1/bk04ch05.html#fn925|title=Chapter 5|website=www.ibiblio.org|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> \n\nThere is another bard's tale that during 12<sup>th</sup> Century, Delwara was being ruled by a Rajput ruler Rao Bhim Singh. His only daughter was married to Rao Samant Singh of Jalore, who had two queens. Sagar was born to Delwara Baiji. Due to differences with the other queen over succession to the throne of [[Jalore]], she returned to her father's place, Delwara. Since Rao Bhim Singh, did not have any male child, his grandson Sagar, a Deora Chauhan, ascended the throne of Delwara.<ref>Seth Rajmal Lalwani; Sukhsampat Raj Bhandari and others (1939).

He was the progenitor of [[Karam Chand Bachhawat|Bachhawat]] clan. Raja Sagar was blessed with three sons - Bohitya, Gangadas and Jaisingh. Whenever there was invasion from Muslims, Rana Jaitra Singh (1213\u201353) called Raja Sagar for help in the battle. Raja Sagar always came along with army and fought valiantly against the invading Muslims.<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\">Jaysom Pathak and Guna Vinaya-1594 (1980).

Besides Gohils, there were brave soldiers from Chauhans, Chandanas, Solankis, Parmars, Chaarans and Tribals who fought for Mewar. They gave a tough fight to Sultan\u2019s army. However, when Jaitra Singh was cornered, he was secretly sheltered in one of the houses in Nagda. Iltutmish was furious and encircled Nagda. Every house was searched, burnt and destroyed. In 14<sup>th</sup> century, according to a mythological tradition of offering water tribute to the martyrs of Bhutalghati, a lake was built at Nagda and christened as BaaghelaTaalab.\u201d There is another bard that says, Maharana Mokal built this lake in memory of his brother Baagh Singh.''</blockquote>\n{{multiple image\n| align = center\n| caption_align = center\n| total_width = 1000\n| image1 = Machind Jain temple (2015) by Mahesh Sharma.jpg\n| alt1 = Machind Jain temple (2015).

Once, apprehending danger to his life from the Muhammadans, Bohitya sought refuge in a Jain Temple at Delwara. It is believed that he was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Bhanwarlal Nahata (2009). Mantri Karam Chand Bachhawat. Prakrit Bharati Academy, Jaipur; BJ Nahata Foundation, Calcutta.</ref>\n\nOne day while Bohitya was asleep in his palace, a snake climbed the bed and bit him on his legs. After biting, the snake hit the prince with his tail and descended from the bed. Prince got up with fright and asked for help. There was commotion in the palace and Raja Sagar came to know of it. The Raja asked the prince, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d The prince replied, \u201cSnake has bitten me\u201d. Raja tried to save him but in vain. People looked around for the snake but couldn't find one. The prince's leg became blue and body turned cold. Knowing that the prince was dead, they took him for the final journey of cremation. At that time the disciples (bhattarack) of Acharya Jindutt Suriji who were out for \u2018Gochari\u2019 (collecting food and alms) saw the funeral procession of the prince. They started discussing among themselves. One disciple said, \u201cThe prince is not dead. Why are they taking him for cremation?\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe Mantri of Raja Sagar, who was passing by, heard the conversation and informed the King. Thus, the life of Prince Bohitya was saved and he was brought back to the palace. Since then Bohitya and his family developed deep faith in Jainism and started paying obeisance to Jain Acharyas and their disciples in Delwara. Bahrang Devi, wife of Raja Bohitya, was a beautiful and talented lady and lived in Delwara. She had eight sons - Shree Karan, Jaiso, Jaimal, Nanha, Bhima, Padam, Somji and Pushmal. [[File:Raja Shri Karan in battle at Chittor by Lalit C Sharma.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Raja Bohitya sacrificed his life in the battle at Chittorgarh, while fighting alongside Rana Ratan Singh I, against Allauddin Khilji in 1303.

Incidentally, \n\n=== Rao Maldeo was uncle of Raja Bohitya. ===\nBoth Rana Ratan Singh I and his cousin Rawal Laksh (Lakshman Singh) were killed in the battle. Raja Bohitya too sacrificed his life in the battle, while fighting alongside Rana Ratan Singh I against Allauddin Khilji in 1303.

Rawat Publications.</ref>Rana Shree Karan Sacrifices his Life for Mewar\nAfter Raja Bohitya, his eldest son Raja Shree Karan ascended to the throne of Delwara. Shree Karan was a kind-hearted king. Raja Shree Karan won Machindragarh (present day village Machind near Kumbhalgarh) in a battle and was bestowed the title of Rana. At one time around mid-14<sup>th</sup> Century the soldiers of Rana Shree Karan looted the treasury of [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Sultan Muhammad Bin Tughluk]] (1325-51) while his army was on a passage through Aravalli's from Delhi to  Gujarat.<ref>Lakshman Singh Mehta (1983).

Sultan [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Muhammad Bin Tughluk]] of Delhi brought in large army to recapture Chittor Fort, but he was defeated by the army of Maharana Hamir Singh I and taken prisoner at Singoli, near [[Mandalgarh]]. Rana Shree Karan was killed in the battle while assisting Maharana Hamir Singh I. Muhammad Bin Tughlug was released after paying 50 lakh Rupees, 100 elephants and several districts. But he died in 1351 at Delhi.

Samdhar, a Deora Chauhan, was the first man in his genealogy to convert to Jainism from the saint and scholar of Khartargachh, Shree Jineshwar Suri Maharaj. Thereafter his descendants became merged in the premier merchant community of Oswals and established matrimonial relation with Jain-Oswal community. He chose Bohotra (Bothra) as the name for his clan on the name of his grandfather Bohitya. Samdhar and all his brothers became the followers of Jainism and organised sangh yatra. Thus, he received the title of Sanghpati. Samdhar was blessed by a son named Tejpal.\u201d<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\" />''</blockquote>After the death of Bothra Samdhar, Tejpal became Sanghpati. He gifted gold, horses, elephants, etc. to the King of [[Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty|Gurjar]] \u2013 [[Patan, Gujarat|Patan]] ([[Anhilpur]]) and the King pleased with his friendship gifted him some part of his region to administer. He successfully ruled the people and helped the poor and needy by providing alms. Tejpal was blessed with a son -Vilha, from his wife Tara Devi.Later on, Tejpal took santhara (fast until death - left all food) and died. After his death, Vilha became Sanghpati. He was very rich but also very philanthropic. He gave generous donations, especially for Jain religion and honoured the sadhvis and shravaks. He had three sons - Kadua, Dharma and Nanda. After Vilha's death, his elder son Kadua became Sanghpati and went to [[Chittorgarh]] to settle down. Later his descendant, Bothra Bachhraj became [[Dewan]] of [[Jodhpur State|Jodhpur]] and founding Dewan of [[Bikaner State|Bikaner.]] Bachhraj's descendants were known as Bachhawats.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n==Delwara after Deora Chauhans==\nLater, in 15th century, the Kingdom of [[Mewar dynasty|Mewar]] was divided into 16 first grade thikanas or districts. Delwara was one of the 16 Rajwadas, along with [[Bari Sadri|Badi Sadri]] and [[Gogunda]]. Delwara has been ruled by Jhala Rajputs from 15<sup>th</sup> Century onwards. The ancestor of the Jhala family was Raj Sahib Raidharji Vogohoji of [[Dhrangadhra State|Dhrangadhara]] ([[Dhrangadhra State|Halvad]]), son of Harpal Makwana. During the reign of Maharana Raimal (1473\u20131509), Ajoji (Ajja Singh Jhala) the deposed son of Raj Sahib Raidharji, along with his brother Sajoji (Sajja Singh Jhala) came to Mewar. Jhalas performed meritorious service in Mewar. Later the Maharana granted the Jagir of Delwara to Kunwar Sajja and that of Bari Sadri to Kunwar Ajja Singh and were granted the title of Raj Rana. \n\nAjja fought alongside [[Rana Sanga|Maharana Sangram Singh]] I (1509\u20131527) against [[Babur]] in 1527 at the [[Battle of Khanwa]]. When Maharana Sangram Singh ([[Rana Sanga]]) was wounded on the battlefield, Ajja donned the Maharana's tunic, which kept the Mewar army together but proved fatal for Raj Rana Ajja, who died in the battle. As many as 7 generations of the Jhala family had been sacrificing their lives for Maharanas of Mewar.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /> \n\nWho ruled Delwara after Deora Chauhans left in 14<sup>th</sup> century till Jhalas came in 15<sup>th</sup> century? There is an inscription plate of 1975, that Ashapura Temple at Berwas (near Debari) was built by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528. Who were the ancestors of Munjerao? Were they descendants of Raja Sagar? It is yet to be researched and established.\n{{scalable image|Table 1 - Genealogical Tree - Deora Chauhans Dynasty.jpg|3500px|Genealogical Tree - Deora Chauhan Dynasty at Jaolore, Sirohi and Delwara in Rajasthan|alt=Genealogical Tree - Deora Chauhan Dynasty at Jaolore, Sirohi and Delwara in Rajasthan|tooltip=no}}\n<br>\n\n== Delightful places <ref>https://wikitravel.org/en/Delwara</ref> ==\n'''Devi Garh Palace''' - This 18th century palace in the village of Delwara has undergone years of restoration and rebuilding.

His mentors at Yale included [[Josef Albers]], [[Richard Lindner (painter)|Richard Lindner]] and [[Vincent Scully]].\n\nInspired by earlier trips to Africa in both 1955 and 1960, Beard traveled to [[Kenya]] upon graduation. Working at [[Tsavo Conservation Area|Tsavo National Park]], he photographed and documented the demise of 35,000 [[elephant]]s and other wildlife, later to become the subject of his first book, ''The End of the Game''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Beard|first1=Peter|title=The End of the Game|date=1965|publisher=Viking Press|location=New York|isbn=978-3-8365-0530-7}}</ref>  During this time, Beard acquired Hog Ranch, a property near the [[Ngong Hills]] adjacent to the coffee farm owned by [[Karen Blixen]] (Isak Dinesen), which would become his lifelong home-base in [[East Africa]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Beard|first1=Peter|title=Peter Beard|date=2013|publisher=Owen, & Aronson|location=Germany|isbn=978-3-8365-3088-0|edition=Collector's}}</ref>\n\n==Art==\n\nBeard's photographs of Africa, African animals and journals that often integrate his photographs have been widely shown and published since the 1970s.

These volumes contain newspaper clippings, dried leaves, insects, old [[sepia tone|sepia]]-toned photos, transcribed telephone messages, [[marginalia]] in [[India ink]], photographs of women, quotes, found objects, and the like; these become incorporated, with original drawings and collage by Beard.

Having made his fortune in the railroad business, James Jerome Hill was a great patron of the arts.  All of his heirs were exposed to and owned great collections, presumably having a strong influence on Beard\u2019s interests in the arts and beauty.\n\nBeard married his first wife (Minnie Cushing Beard Coleman) in 1967; their marriage lasted only briefly.{{cn|date=April 2020}} His second wife was [[supermodel]] [[Cheryl Tiegs]], from 1982 to 1986.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 1986, he married Nejma Khanum.

Same-sex sexual activity is legal in [[Cambodia]]. While traditional cultural mores tend to be tolerant in this area, even expressly providing support for people of an intermediate or [[third gender]], LGBT rights legislation has not yet been enacted by the ruling [[Cambodian People's Party]].\n\nKing [[Norodom Sihamoni]] supports the legalisation of same-sex marriage.<ref>[http://thediplomat.com/2017/05/cambodias-gays-out-of-the-shadows/ Cambodia's Gays: Out of the Shadows?]</ref> After the [[Same-sex marriage in Taiwan|Taiwanese Constitutional Court ruled that banning same-sex marriage was unconstitutional]], many called on Cambodia to legalise same-sex marriage.<ref>[http://www.khmertimeskh.com/news/38952/call-to-legalise-gay-marriage/ Call to legalise gay marriage]</ref>\n\n[[Phnom Penh]] and [[Siem Reap]] have a visible LGBT scene, with many bars, clubs and other venues catering to the LGBT community. Pride parades have been held in Cambodia since 2003, and have been gaining traction every year. However, while LGBT visitors tend to feel accepted, many LGBT Cambodians report societal discrimination, including forced opposite-sex marriages, discrimination at work and bullying at schools. Several human rights group, notably the Cambodian Center for Human Rights, CamASEAN and the Rainbow Community Kampuchea, work to reduce LGBT-related discrimination and raise awareness of LGBT people.<ref>[https://theculturetrip.com/asia/cambodia/articles/whats-it-like-to-be-lgbt-in-cambodia/ What's It Like to Be LGBT in Cambodia?]</ref> Through their work, they have persuaded the Government to introduce new LGBT-inclusive education classes in all Cambodian schools and to offer same-sex couples limited legal recognition.\n\n==Legality of same-sex sexual activity==\nPrivate, adult, non-commercial and consensual homosexuality is legal in Cambodia, and was never criminalised in the history of the country.<ref name=\"code\">[http://www.unodc.org/res/cld/document/khm/criminal_code_of_the_kingdom_of_cambodia_html/Cambodia_Criminal-Code-of-the-Kingdom-of-Cambodia-30-Nov-2009-Eng.pdf Criminal Code of the Kingdom of Cambodia]</ref> The age of consent is 15, regardless of gender and sexual orientation. A few aspects of the Criminal Code may impact the rights of LGBT people living in Cambodia: it is illegal in Cambodia to be a prostitute or live in the same residence as prostitutes. This becomes an issue when LGBT people live on the streets and don't have access to education. Article 298 of the Criminal Code prohibits soliciting for sex in public, even if the sexual activity will take place in private, with fines.\n\n==Recognition of same-sex relationships==\n{{main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Cambodia}}\n\nThe Civil Code and the ''Law on the Marriage and Family'' explicitly ban [[same-sex marriage]] and do not recognise civil partnerships in Cambodia. There, however, has been greater public awareness about same-sex couples since the 1990s.\n\nSince September 1993, the [[Constitution of Cambodia]] has defined marriage as a union between one man and one woman. The provision in the Constitution related to marriage was modified in 2011 but still defines marriage as between \"one husband and one wife\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://healthdev.net/site/post.php?s=2303 |title=MSM, HIV and Marital Law |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817184625/http://healthdev.net/site/post.php?s=2303 |archivedate=17 August 2011}}</ref> Although, cases of same-sex marriage could still be officiated over in religious ceremonies. In one case of partnership recognition, Khav Sokha and Pum Eth were married on 12 March 1995, in the village of Kro Bao Ach Kok, in [[Kandal Province]], where they are from. Sokha said in an interview to the ''[[Phnom Penh Post]]'', \"The authorities thought it was strange, but they agreed to tolerate it because I have three children already (from a previous marriage). They said that if we were both single (and childless), we would not be allowed to get married because we could not produce children.\" Thus, it was a fully acknowledged marriage, with official approval, and there was not really any reaction to it. It was a popular event, with 250 people coming to the ceremony and partying, including Buddhist monks and high officials from the province.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gay411.org/?region=2&category=&countryID=143 |title=Gay411 |access-date=1 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724212535/http://www.gay411.org/?region=2&category=&countryID=143 |archive-date=24 July 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn February 2004, the issue of LGBT rights in Cambodia was discussed by then King [[Norodom Sihanouk]].

King Sihanouk also stated that he believed that God views homosexuals, as well as transvestites, as equal because \"[God loves] wide range of tastes\". Current King [[Norodom Sihamoni]] also supports the legalisation of same-sex marriage.\n\nIn 2015, Council of Ministers spokesman Phay Siphan expressed support for same-sex marriage in Cambodia, by saying that current law already protects LGBT people from discrimination. The Cambodian Center for Human Rights disputed this statement and called on the Government to pass legislation in order to ensure LGBT equality.<ref>[http://www.khmertimeskh.com/news/16143/cambodia-welcomes-same-sex-marriage--gov---t-spokesman-says/ Cambodia Welcomes Same-Sex Marriage, Gov\u2019t Spokesman Says]{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe Rainbow Community Kampuchea ({{lang-km|\u179f\u17a0\u1782\u1798\u1793\u17cd\u17a5\u1793\u17d2\u1791\u1792\u1793\u17bc\u1780\u1798\u17d2\u1796\u17bb\u1787\u17b6}}; RoCK), with the help of local authorities, has created a formal relationship registry program, called the \"Declaration of Family Relationship\".

As in [[Thailand]], the term ''kathoey'' now refers almost exclusively to the physiologically masculine pair of this term \u2013 i.e., physical males who have a female identity, most often expressed in cross-dressing.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=dIvD6eyT27UC&pg=PA62 Babara Earth, ''Diverse Genders and Sexualities in Cambodia'', p.61]</ref>\n\nThe broad category of ''kteuy'' covers two distinct sub-groupings, \"short hairs\" and \"long hairs\". Short hairs (\u179f\u1780\u17cb\u200b\u1781\u17d2\u179b\u17b8, ''sak klay'') are men who dress and identify as men but have sex with \"real\" men; they are usually married, and very few of them have sex exclusively with men. Long hairs (\u179f\u1780\u17cb\u200b\u179c\u17c2\u1784, ''sak veng'', also called \u179f\u17d2\u179a\u17b8\u179f\u17d2\u179a\u179f\u17cb, ''srey sros'', \"charming girls\"), identify and behave as women, and may use hormones and surgery to change their physical sex. They call themselves ''kteuy'', but may feel insulted if outsiders use this term.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=dIvD6eyT27UC&pg=PA62 Babara Earth, ''Diverse Genders and Sexualities in Cambodia'', pp. 63\u201365]</ref>\n\n\"Real men\" (\u1794\u17d2\u179a\u17bb\u179f\u1796\u17b7\u178f\u1794\u17d2\u179a\u17b6\u1780\u178a, ''pros pith brakat''), men who identify, appear and behave as \"pros\", are the object of desire for both \"long\" and \"short hairs\". All \"real men\" are, or will be, married; some have sex only with women, but others have a range of sexual partners.\n\n''Kteuys'' face significant problems of social acceptance (including issues relating to marriage and children) and violence. The general social environment towards ''kteuys'' is tolerant, but those who transgress gender behaviour are nevertheless treated with contempt and subject to discrimination (\"real men\" with important jobs who engage in same-sex relations hide their lifestyles). Some \"real men\" are violently prejudiced against \"non-real men\", and may attack or rape them (former [[King Sihanouk]] once commented that \"real men\", not minorities, are the source of violence in society).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=dIvD6eyT27UC&pg=PA62 Babara Earth, ''Diverse Genders and Sexualities in Cambodia'', p.65]</ref>\n\nThe cultural tolerance of LGBT people has yet to advance LGBT rights legislation. While the cultural mores and Buddhism tend to produce a degree of tolerance for LGBT people, harassment and discrimination still occur and there is also intense social pressure to marry a suitable person of the opposite sex, and raise a family.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lgbt-cambodia_us_5614ed2de4b0fad1591a0ced In Cambodia, Some Families Still Try To \u2018Cure\u2019 LGBT Sons And Daughters]</ref>\n\n=== HIV/AIDS ===\nIn 2019, Keo Remy, the director of the Cambodia Human Rights Committee said that there has been an increase of [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]] infections within the LGBT community, especially among people under 30.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.towleroad.com/2019/01/cambodian-president-makes-pioneering-pledge-to-lgbt-community-and-hiv-treatment-prevention/|title=Cambodian President Makes Pioneering Pledge To LGBT Community And HIV Treatment & Prevention|date=2019-01-03|website=Towleroad Gay News|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref>\n\n=== LGBT tourism ===\nWhile not officially government-sponsored, there is also an active business for LGBT tourists visiting Cambodia.<ref>[http://www.frommers.com/destinations/cambodia/planning-a-trip/tips-for-gay-and-lesbian-travelers Tips for Gay and Lesbian Travelers]</ref>\n\nIn February 2011, after some Cambodian tourism businesses had set up a global campaign called ''Adore Cambodia!'' to let LGBT tourists know they are welcome in the country, the Ministry of Tourism welcomed this initiative. \"We have no policy to discriminate on sex, national and religious grounds.

The first ever Cambodian-made film depicting a homosexual relationship debuted in early 2009, going on to become a [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] in the country; it was called ''[[Who Am I? (2009 film)|Who Am I?]]''.

LGBTI persons were frequently harassed and bullied because of their appearance and their work in the entertainment and commercial sex sectors. There were no reports of government discrimination based on sexual orientation in employment, citizenship, access to education, or health care. The general population, however, typically treated persons involved in consensual same-sex relationships with fear and suspicion.<br/> A local LGBTI rights organization reported more than 100 incidents of violence or abuse against LGBTI persons, including domestic violence by family members.

Pride parades have been held in Cambodia since 2003, and have been gaining traction every year. However, while LGBT visitors tend to feel accepted, many LGBT Cambodians report societal discrimination, including forced opposite-sex marriages, discrimination at work and bullying at schools. Several human rights group, notably the Cambodian Center for Human Rights, CamASEAN and the Rainbow Community Kampuchea, work to reduce LGBT-related discrimination and raise awareness of LGBT people.<ref>[https://theculturetrip.com/asia/cambodia/articles/whats-it-like-to-be-lgbt-in-cambodia/ What's It Like to Be LGBT in Cambodia?]</ref> Through their work, they have persuaded the Government to introduce new LGBT-inclusive education classes in all Cambodian schools and to offer same-sex couples limited legal recognition.\n\n==Legality of same-sex sexual activity==\nPrivate, adult, non-commercial and consensual homosexuality is legal in Cambodia, and was never criminalised in the history of the country.<ref name=\"code\">[http://www.unodc.org/res/cld/document/khm/criminal_code_of_the_kingdom_of_cambodia_html/Cambodia_Criminal-Code-of-the-Kingdom-of-Cambodia-30-Nov-2009-Eng.pdf Criminal Code of the Kingdom of Cambodia]</ref> The age of consent is 15, regardless of gender and sexual orientation. A few aspects of the Criminal Code may impact the rights of LGBT people living in Cambodia: it is illegal in Cambodia to be a prostitute or live in the same residence as prostitutes. This becomes an issue when LGBT people live on the streets and don't have access to education. Article 298 of the Criminal Code prohibits soliciting for sex in public, even if the sexual activity will take place in private, with fines.\n\n==Recognition of same-sex relationships==\n{{main|Recognition of same-sex unions in Cambodia}}\n\nThe Civil Code and the ''Law on the Marriage and Family'' explicitly ban [[same-sex marriage]] and do not recognise civil partnerships in Cambodia. There, however, has been greater public awareness about same-sex couples since the 1990s.\n\nSince September 1993, the [[Constitution of Cambodia]] has defined marriage as a union between one man and one woman. The provision in the Constitution related to marriage was modified in 2011 but still defines marriage as between \"one husband and one wife\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://healthdev.net/site/post.php?s=2303 |title=MSM, HIV and Marital Law |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817184625/http://healthdev.net/site/post.php?s=2303 |archivedate=17 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Although, cases of same-sex marriage could still be officiated over in religious ceremonies.

Sokha said in an interview to the ''[[Phnom Penh Post]]'', \"The authorities thought it was strange, but they agreed to tolerate it because I have three children already (from a previous marriage). They said that if we were both single (and childless), we would not be allowed to get married because we could not produce children.\" Thus, it was a fully acknowledged marriage, with official approval, and there was not really any reaction to it.

As in [[Thailand]], the term ''kathoey'' now refers almost exclusively to the physiologically masculine pair of this term \u2013 i.e., physical males who have a female identity, most often expressed in cross-dressing.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=dIvD6eyT27UC&pg=PA62 Babara Earth, ''Diverse Genders and Sexualities in Cambodia'', p.61]</ref>\n\nThe broad category of ''kteuy'' covers two distinct sub-groupings, \"short hairs\" and \"long hairs\". Short hairs (\u179f\u1780\u17cb\u200b\u1781\u17d2\u179b\u17b8, ''sak klay'') are men who dress and identify as men but have sex with \"real\" men; they are usually married, and very few of them have sex exclusively with men. Long hairs (\u179f\u1780\u17cb\u200b\u179c\u17c2\u1784, ''sak veng'', also called \u179f\u17d2\u179a\u17b8\u179f\u17d2\u179a\u179f\u17cb, ''srey sros'', \"charming girls\"), identify and behave as women, and may use hormones and surgery to change their physical sex. They call themselves ''kteuy'', but may feel insulted if outsiders use this term.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=dIvD6eyT27UC&pg=PA62 Babara Earth, ''Diverse Genders and Sexualities in Cambodia'', p.63-65]</ref>\n\n\"Real men\" (\u1794\u17d2\u179a\u17bb\u179f\u1796\u17b7\u178f\u1794\u17d2\u179a\u17b6\u1780\u178a, ''pros pith brakat''), men who identify, appear and behave as \"pros\", are the object of desire for both \"long\" and \"short hairs\". All \"real men\" are, or will be, married; some have sex only with women, but others have a range of sexual partners.\n\n''Kteuys'' face significant problems of social acceptance (including issues relating to marriage and children) and violence. The general social environment towards ''kteuys'' is tolerant, but those who transgress gender behaviour are nevertheless treated with contempt and subject to discrimination (\"real men\" with important jobs who engage in same-sex relations hide their lifestyles). Some \"real men\" are violently prejudiced against \"non-real men\", and may attack or rape them (former [[King Sihanouk]] once commented that \"real men\", not minorities, are the source of violence in society).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=dIvD6eyT27UC&pg=PA62 Babara Earth, ''Diverse Genders and Sexualities in Cambodia'', p.65]</ref>\n\nThe cultural tolerance of LGBT people has yet to advance LGBT rights legislation.

Robert Allen Boyer, your average \u201cB\u201d chemistry student was given an extraordinary opportunity that changed his future and the future of automobile production in the U.S. (Plastic) Boyer, born on 30 September 1909 in Toledo, Ohio was given this chance when Ford hired his father to run the nation's oldest hotel, the Wayside Inn, in South Sudbury, Massachusetts.  Ford frequented the inn and that is where Boyer was discovered.  Ford claimed that Boyer had a \u201ckeen active mind\u201d.  He asked Boyer to enroll in the new Henry Ford Trade School and participate in its unique work-study program instead of following his plans to enter Andover prep school and then Dartmouth College (Shurtleff).  Boyer excelled in the Ford Trade School and took to exploring concepts such as how to manufacture synthetic wool from soybeans. These were the types of problems that stumped the experts (Plastic).  Boyer graduated the Ford Trade School at the age of 21 with a promising chemistry career in front of him.  He started this career as the head of the soybean lab at the Edison Institute (Shurtleff).  Here Boyer\u2019s career took off.  He started working to use soybeans in ways they had never been used before.  Boyer has done things from extracting lubricating and paint oils from the soybean to creating a synthetic wool made from soybeans and pressing insulating varnish for starters and generators (Plastic).  One of Boyer\u2019s first projects began in 1932 and included building \u201ca small solvent extractor to separate the bean into soy oil and protein-rich meal\u201d (Shurtleff).  The soybean oil became the most crucial commercial soy products on Ford cars. In 1934 the five to eight coats of lacquer that cars previously had been finished with was replaced with a synthetic baked enamel paint which contained about 35% soy oil.  This new synthetic paint with soy oil saved considerable time and money.  In 1937, Boyer developed a curved plastic sheet which he hoped would replace steel in the auto bodies of ford cars.  He was so confident in his product that he took an axe to it in the middle of a crowd of reporters and critics. He also jumped up and down on the curved sheet.  When there was no bending in the sheet and no shattering due to the axe and the weight of him jumping on the sheet, people were astounded (shurtleff).  This soy protein plastic sheet consist of 70% cellulose and 30% resin binder pressed into cloth.  \u201cThe new rust-free, dent-proof plastic was reportedly 50% lighter and 50% cheaper to produce than steel\u201d (Shurtleff).   This new plastic body cut the total weight of the car from 3,000&nbsp;lb. to 2,000 (Dearborn). The sheets look like polished steel and can be bent but just snap back into place, therefore when caught in fender benders, the fender would bounce back like \u201crubber balls\u201d (Shurtleff).  Needless to say, this product was a breakthrough in the world of automobile production.  Boyer also used the soy isolates to produce the world's first plant protein fiber in 1938. (Shurtleff.)

Robert Allen Boyer, your average \u201cB\u201d chemistry student was given an extraordinary opportunity that changed his future and the future of automobile production in the U.S. (Plastic) Boyer, born on 30 September 1909 in Toledo, Ohio was given this chance when Ford hired his father to run the nation's oldest hotel, the Wayside Inn, in South Sudbury, Massachusetts.  Ford frequented the inn and that is where Boyer was discovered.  Ford claimed that Boyer had a \u201ckeen active mind\u201d.  He asked Boyer to enroll in the new Henry Ford Trade School and participate in its unique work-study program instead of following his plans to enter Andover prep school and then Dartmouth College (Shurtleff).  Boyer excelled in the Ford Trade School and took to exploring concepts such as how to manufacture synthetic wool from soybeans. These were the types of problems that stumped the experts (Plastic).  Boyer graduated the Ford Trade School at the age of 21 with a promising chemistry career in front of him.  He started this career as the head of the soybean lab at the Edison Institute (Shurtleff).  Here Boyer\u2019s career took off.  He started working to use soybeans in ways they had never been used before.  Boyer has done things from extracting lubricating and paint oils from the soybean to creating a synthetic wool made from soybeans and pressing insulating varnish for starters and generators (Plastic).  One of Boyer\u2019s first projects began in 1932 and included building \u201ca small solvent extractor to separate the bean into soy oil and protein-rich meal\u201d (Shurtleff).  The soybean oil became the most crucial commercial soy products on Ford cars. In 1934 the five to eight coats of lacquer that cars previously had been finished with was replaced with a synthetic baked enamel paint which contained about 35% soy oil.  This new synthetic paint with soy oil saved considerable time and money.  In 1937, Boyer developed a curved plastic sheet which he hoped would replace steel in the auto bodies of ford cars.  He was so confident in his product that he took an axe to it in the middle of a crowd of reporters and critics. He also jumped up and down on the curved sheet.  When there was no bending in the sheet and no shattering due to the axe and the weight of him jumping on the sheet, people were astounded (shurtleff).  This soy protein plastic sheet consist of 70% cellulose and 30% resin binder pressed into cloth.  \u201cThe new rust-free, dent-proof plastic was reportedly 50% lighter and 50% cheaper to produce than steel\u201d (Shurtleff).   This new plastic body cut the total weight of the car from 3,000&nbsp;lb. to 2,000 (Dearborn). The sheets look like polished steel and can be bent but just snap back into place, therefor when caught in fender benders, the fender would bounce back like \u201crubber balls\u201d (Shurtleff).  Needless to say, this product was a breakthrough in the world of automobile production.  Boyer also used the soy isolates to produce the world's first plant protein fiber in 1938. (Shurtleff.)   This fiber resembled a soft wool, it was tan in color, had a medium luster and a soft warm feel. \u201cit has 80% the strength of wool, took the same dyes, had good elongation, and did not wet as easily as wool.\u201d(Shurtleff).

She bettered her personal 72-hole best with 30 strokes and beat the whole Swedish amateur national team, of which some did not even had heard of Neumann before the tournament.

At home, Betty's husband Arthur Heroz (Perkins), a successful author, comments on how a lump in Betty's left breast has grown appreciably harder since she had it examined some time ago. Betty promises to make a follow-up exam. The subsequent checkup, however, leads to a diagnosis of cancer. Following a period of fear and denial, Betty agrees to a biopsy, which, due to the cancer's spread, leads to an immediate mastectomy. Upon leaving the hospital, Betty tries to deal with her varied emotions, along with those of her self-involved spouse, former lover, mother and friends. When she can't perform simple tasks like putting on a robe, Betty falls into depression. She sees herself as \"damaged goods\", leading to dramatic intimacy issues with Arthur.\n\nBetty returns to work, but feels only awkwardness with colleagues. Things worsen when Betty finally looks at her scar, and assumes that all men will now be repulsed by her body.

At home, Betty's husband Arthur Heroz (Perkins), a successful author, comments on how a lump in Betty's left breast has grown appreciably harder since she had it examined some time ago. Betty promises to make a follow-up exam. The subsequent checkup, however, leads to a diagnosis of cancer. Following a period of fear and denial, Betty agrees to a biopsy, which, due to the cancer's spread, leads to an immediate mastectomy. Upon leaving the hospital, Betty tries to deal with her varied emotions, along with those of her self-involved spouse, former lover, mother and friends. When she can't perform simple tasks like putting on a robe, Betty falls into depression. She sees herself as \"damaged goods\", leading to dramatic intimacy issues with Arthur.\n\nBetty returns to work, but feels only awkwardness with colleagues. Things worsen when Betty finally looks at her scar, and assumes that all men will now be repulsed by her body. When husband Arthur becomes increasingly distant, she reunites with former beau David (Crenna). She goes to live with him in Philadelphia, quitting her job and leaving her friends behind. After a period of bliss, however, Betty still finds herself unhappy. She the decides to write a book about her travails, leading to an overhaul of her life, both professionally and personally.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Mary Tyler Moore]] as [[Betty Rollin]]\n*[[Anthony Perkins]] as Arthur Heroz\n*[[Jennifer Warren]] as Erica Wells\n*[[Richard Dysart]] as Dr. Brennerman\n*[[Don Johnson]] as Daniel Easton\n*[[Florence Eldridge]] as Mrs. Rollin\n*[[Patricia Barry]] as Anne\n*[[Antoinette Bower]] as Marsha\n*[[Richard Crenna]] as David Towers\n*[[Vivi Janiss]] as Martha\n\n==Production==\n''First, You Cry'' was shot from February 14 to March 1978: exterior scenes were filmed on location in [[New York City]] and interior scenes were filmed at [[CBS Studio Center]] in [[Studio City, Los Angeles|Studio City, California]].\n\n==Award nominations==\n*Nominated: 1979 [[Golden Globe Award]] \u2013 [[Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film|Best Motion Picture Made for Television]]\n*Nominated: 1979 [[Primetime Emmy Award]] \u2013 [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Television Movie|Outstanding Drama or Comedy Special]]\n*Nominated: 1979 [[Primetime Emmy Award]] \u2013 [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Limited Series or Movie|Outstanding Film Editing for a Limited Series or a Special]] (James Galloway)\n*Nominated: 1979 [[Primetime Emmy Award]] \u2013 [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie|Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or a Special]] (Mary Tyler Moore)\n*Nominated: 1979 [[Primetime Emmy Award]] \u2013 [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Miniseries, Movie, or a Special|Outstanding Music Composition for a Limited Series or a Special]] (Peter Matz)\n*Nominated: 1979 [[American Cinema Editors]] \u2013 [[American_Cinema_Editors#Eddie_Awards|Best Edited Television Special]] (James Galloway)\n*Nominated: 1979 [[Directors Guild of America Award]] \u2013 [[Directors_Guild_of_America_Award#Outstanding_Directorial_Achievement_in_Movies_for_Television_and_Miniseries|Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Specials/Movies for TV/Actuality]] (George Schaefer)\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe film was parodied on the November 17, 1979 episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' hosted by [[Bea Arthur]], in a sketch titled \"First He Cries\".

According to a local rhyme, the demise of ''Venta Icenorum'' led to the development of Norwich: \"Caistor was a city when Norwich was none, Norwich was built of Caistor stone.\"{{sfn |Morley |2006}}\n\n===Early English and Norman conquest===\n[[File:Norwich Cathedral, spire and south transept.jpg|thumb|[[Norwich Cathedral]] is one of the great Norman buildings of England.]]\nThere are two suggested models of development for Norwich. It is possible that three separate early Anglo-Saxon settlements, one north of the river and two either side on the south, joined together as they grew or that one Anglo-Saxon settlement, north of the river, emerged in the mid-7th century after the abandonment of the previous three. The ancient city was a thriving centre for trade and commerce in East Anglia in 1004 when it was raided and burnt by [[Sweyn I of Denmark|Swein Forkbeard]] the [[Viking]] king of Denmark. [[Mercia]]n coins and shards of pottery from the [[Rhineland]] dating from the 8th century suggest that long-distance trade was happening long before this. Between 924 and 939, Norwich became fully established as a town, with its own mint. The word ''Norvic'' appears on coins across Europe minted during this period, in the reign of [[Athelstan|King Athelstan]]. The Vikings were a strong cultural influence in Norwich for 40 to 50 years at the end of the 9th century, setting up an [[Anglo-Scandinavian]] district near the north end of present-day King Street. At the time of the [[Norman Conquest]], the city was one of the largest in England. The [[Domesday Book]] states that it had approximately 25 churches and a population of between 5,000 and 10,000. It also records the site of an Anglo-Saxon church in Tombland, the site of the Saxon market place and the later [[Norwich Cathedral|Norman cathedral]]. Norwich continued to be a major centre for trade, the River Wensum being a convenient export route to the [[River Yare]] and [[Great Yarmouth]], which served as the [[Port of Norwich|port for Norwich]]. [[Quern stone]]s and other artefacts from Scandinavia and the Rhineland have been found during excavations in Norwich city centre. These date from the 11th century onwards.\n\n[[File:Norwich Castle.jpg|thumb|[[Norwich Castle]]'s 12th-century keep]]\n[[Norwich Castle]] was founded soon after the Norman Conquest.<ref>{{PastScape |mnumber=132268 |mname=Norwich Castle |accessdate=29 December 2010}}</ref> The [[Domesday Book]] records that 98 Saxon homes were demolished to make way for the castle.{{sfn |Harfield |1991 |pp=373, 384}} The [[Normans]] established a new focus of settlement around the Castle and the area to the west of it: this became known as the \"New\" or \"French\" borough, centred on the Normans' own market place, which survives today as Norwich Market. In 1096, [[Herbert de Losinga]], [[Bishop of Thetford]], began construction of [[Norwich Cathedral]]. The chief building material for the Cathedral was limestone, imported from Caen in Normandy. To transport the building stone to the site, a canal was cut from the river (from the site of present-day Pulls Ferry) up to the east wall. Herbert de Losinga then moved his [[Episcopal see|See]] there, to what became the cathedral church for the [[Anglican Diocese of Norwich|Diocese of Norwich]]. The Bishop of Norwich still signs himself ''Norvic''. Norwich received a [[royal charter]] from [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] in 1158, and another from [[Richard I of England|Richard ''the Lionheart'']] in 1194. After a riot in the city in 1274, Norwich has the distinction of being the only complete English city to be excommunicated by the Pope.{{sfn |Blomefield |1806}}\n\n===Middle Ages===\nThe first recorded presence of [[Jews]] in Norwich is 1134.<ref name=\"heritagecity1\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.heritagecity.org/research-centre/churches-and-creeds/jews-in-norwich.htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130806235625/http://www.heritagecity.org/research-centre/churches-and-creeds/jews-in-norwich.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 August 2013 |title=Jews in Norwich |publisher=Heritagecity.org |accessdate=13 September 2013}}</ref> In 1144, the Jews of Norwich were falsely accused of [[ritual murder]] after a boy ([[William of Norwich]]) was found dead with stab wounds.<ref name=\"heritagecity1\"/> William acquired the status of martyr and was subsequently [[canonization|canonised]].

The Great Hospital dates from 1249 and the College of St Mary in the Field from 1250. In 1256, Whitefriars was founded. In 1266 the city was sacked by the \"Disinherited\". It has the distinction of being the only English city ever to be excommunicated, following a riot between citizens and monks in 1274.{{sfn |Blomefield |1806}} As a penance, St Ethelbert's Gate, one of the entrances to the cathedral priory, was constructed by Norwich citizens. In 1278 the Cathedral received final consecration. In 1290 the city flooded. Austin Friary was founded in that year.\n\nThe engine of trade was [[wool]] from Norfolk's [[sheepwalk]]s. Wool made England rich, and the [[staple right|staple port]] of Norwich \"in her state doth stand With towns of high'st regard the fourth of all the land\", as [[Michael Drayton]] noted in ''[[Poly-Olbion]]'' (1612). The wealth generated by the [[wool#History|wool trade]] throughout the [[Middle Ages]] financed the construction of many fine churches, so that Norwich still has more medieval churches than any other city in Western Europe north of the [[Alps]]. Throughout this period Norwich established wide-ranging trading links with other parts of Europe, its markets stretching from [[Scandinavia]] to Spain and the city housing a [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] warehouse. To organise and control its exports to the [[Low Countries]], Great Yarmouth, as the port for Norwich, was designated one of the staple ports under the terms of the 1353 [[Statute of the Staple]].\n\nFrom 1280 to 1340 the [[defensive wall|city walls]] were built. At around {{convert|2 + 1/2|mi|km|}}, these walls, along with the river, enclosed a larger area than that of the [[City of London]]. However, when the city walls were constructed it was made illegal to build outside them, inhibiting expansion of the city. Around this time, the city was made a [[county corporate]] and became the seat of one of the most densely populated and prosperous [[ancient counties of England|counties]] of England. Part of these walls remain standing today.\n\n===Early modern period (1485\u20131640)===\nHand-in-hand with the wool industry, this key religious centre experienced a Reformation significantly different to other parts of England.

Unlike popular challenges elsewhere in the Tudor period, it appears to have been [[Protestant]] in nature. For several weeks, rebels led by [[Robert Kett]] camped outside Norwich on [[Mousehold Heath]] and took control of the city on 29 July 1549 with the support of many of its poorer inhabitants. [[Kett's Rebellion]] was particularly in response to the enclosure of land by landlords, leaving peasants with nowhere to graze their animals and the general abuses of power by the nobility. The uprising ended on 27 August when the rebels were defeated by an army.

In the case of Norwich, this process was underscored later by the arrival of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and [[Flemish people|Flemish]] \"[[Elizabethan Strangers|Strangers]]\" fleeing persecution from the Catholics and eventually numbering as many as one-third of the city's population.{{sfn |Houlbroke |McClendon |2004 |p=257}} Large numbers of such exiles came to the city, especially Flemish Protestants from the Westkwartier (\"Western Quarter\"), a region in the [[Southern Netherlands]] where the first [[Calvinist]] fires of the [[Dutch Revolt]] had spread. Inhabitants of [[Ypres]], in particular, chose Norwich above other destinations.{{sfn |Fagel |2003 |p=52}} Perhaps in response to Kett, Norwich became the first provincial city to initiate compulsory payments for a civic scheme of poor relief, which it has been claimed led to its wider introduction, forming the basis of the later Elizabethan Poor Law of 1597\u20131598.{{sfn |Pound |2004 |pp=50\u201356}}\n\nNorwich has traditionally been the home of various minorities, notably French [[Huguenot]] and Belgian [[Walloons|Walloon]] communities in the 16th and 17th centuries. The great \"stranger\" immigration of 1567 brought a substantial Flemish and Walloon community of Protestant [[weaver (occupation)|weaver]]s to Norwich, where they are said to have been made welcome.{{sfn |Ketton-Cremer |1957}} The merchant's house which was their earliest base in the city \u2014 now a museum \u2014 is still known as [[Strangers' Hall]]. It seems that the strangers integrated into the local community without much animosity, at least among the business fraternity, who had the most to gain from their skills. Their arrival in Norwich boosted trade with mainland Europe and fostered a movement toward religious reform and radical politics in the city. By contrast, after being persecuted by the Anglican church for his [[Puritan]] beliefs, [[Michael Metcalf (puritan)|Michael Metcalf]], a 17th-century Norwich weaver, fled the city and settled in [[Dedham, Massachusetts]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=A New England Town |last=Lockridge |first=Kenneth |year=1985 |publisher=W.

Along with their advanced techniques in textile working, they brought pet canaries which they began to breed locally; eventually becoming, in the 20th century, a mascot of the city and the emblem of its football club, [[Norwich City F.C.]], whose nickname is \"The Canaries\". \n\nPrinting was introduced to the city in 1567 by Anthony de Solempne, one of the strangers, but it did not take root and had died out by about 1572.{{sfn |Stoker |1981}}\n\n===Civil War to Victorian era===\nAcross the Eastern Counties, [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s powerful [[Eastern Association]] was eventually dominant. However, to begin with, there had been a large element of Royalist sympathy within Norwich, which seems to have experienced a continuity of its two-sided political tradition throughout the period. Bishop [[Matthew Wren]] was a forceful supporter of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. Nonetheless, [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] recruitment took hold. The strong Royalist party was stifled by a lack of commitment from the aldermen and isolation from Royalist-held regions.{{sfn |Hopper |2004}} Serious inter-factional disturbances culminated in \"The Great Blow\" of 1648 when Parliamentary forces tried to quell a Royalist riot. The latter's gunpowder was set off by accident in the city centre, causing mayhem. According to Hopper<ref>{{harvnb |Hopper |2004}},</ref> the explosion \"ranks among the largest of the century\". Stoutly defended though East Anglia was by the Parliamentary army, there are said to have been pubs in Norwich where the king's health was still drunk and the name of the Protector sung to ribald verse.\n\nAt the cost of some discomfort to the Mayor, the moderate [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]] was targeted because of his position as Bishop of Norwich.\n\nNorwich was marked in the period after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] of 1660 and the ensuing century by a golden age of its cloth industry, comparable only to those in the [[West Country]] and Yorkshire.{{sfn |Wilson |2004a}} But unlike other cloth-manufacturing regions, Norwich weaving brought greater urbanisation, mainly concentrated in the surrounds of the city itself, creating an urban society, with features such as leisure time, alehouses and other public forums of debate and argument.{{sfn |Wilson |2004b}}\n\n[[File:Original Norfolk and Norwich Hospital - geograph.org.uk - 84361.jpg|thumb|Founded in 1771, the [[Norfolk and Norwich Hospital]] cared for the city's poor and sick. It closed in 2003 after services were moved to the [[Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital]].]]\nWriting of the early 18th century, Pound describes the city's rich cultural life, the winter theatre season, the festivities accompanying the summer assizes, and other popular entertainments. Norwich was the wealthiest town in England, with a sophisticated system of [[poor relief]], and a large influx of foreign refugees.{{sfn |Pound |2004 |p=61}} Despite severe outbreaks of plague, the city had a population of almost 30,000. This made Norwich unique in England, although there were some 50 cities of similar size in Europe. In some, like Lyon and [[Dresden]], this was, as in the case of Norwich, linked to an important proto-industry, such as textiles or china pottery, in some, such as Vienna, Madrid and Dublin, to the city's status as an administrative capital, and in some such as Antwerp, Marseilles and Cologne to a position on an important maritime or river trade route.{{efn|1=For table of city sizes see {{harvtxt |Corfield |2004 |p=143}}}}\n\nNorwich in the late 17th century was riven politically. Churchman [[Humphrey Prideaux]] described \"two factions, [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] and [[Tory]], and both contend for their way with the utmost violence.\"{{sfn |Knights |2004}} Nor did the city accept the outcome of the 1688 [[Glorious Revolution]] with a unified voice. The pre-eminent citizen, Bishop William Lloyd, would not take the oaths of allegiance to the new monarchs. One report has it that in 1704 the landlord of Fowler's alehouse \"with a glass of beer in hand, went down on his knees and drank a health to James the third, wishing the Crowne [sic] well and settled on his head.\"{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174 |quote= \"Never was a city in the miserable kingdom so wretchedly divided as this,\" said the ''London Post''}}\n\nIn 1716, at a play at the ''New Inn'', the Pretender was cheered and the audience booed and hissed every time King George's name was mentioned. In 1722 supporters of the king were said to be \"hiss'd at and curst as they go in the streets,\" and in 1731 \"a Tory mobb, in a great body, went through several parts of this city, in a riotous manner, cursing and abusing such as they knew to be friends of the government.\"{{efn |1=Reports quoted by {{harvnb |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}}}} But the Whigs gradually gained control and by the 1720s they had successfully petitioned Parliament to allow all adult males working in the textile industry to take up the freedom, on the correct assumption that they would vote Whig. But it had the effect of boosting the city's popular Jacobitism, says Knights, and contests of the kind described continued in Norwich well into a period in which political stability had been discerned at a national level. The city's Jacobitism perhaps only ended with 1745, well after it had ceased to be a significant movement outside Scotland.{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}} Despite the Highlanders reaching Derby and Norwich citizens mustering themselves into an association to protect the city, some Tories refused to join in, and the vestry of [[St Peter Mancroft]] resolved that it would not ring its bells to summon the defence. Still, it was the end of the road for Norwich Jacobites, and the Whigs organised a notable celebration after the [[Battle of Culloden]].{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}}\n\nThe events of this period illustrate how Norwich had a strong tradition of popular protest favouring Church and Stuarts and attached to the street and alehouse. Knights tells how in 1716 the mayoral election had ended in a riot, with both sides throwing \"brick-ends and great paving stones\" at each other.{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}} A renowned Jacobite watering-hole, the ''Blue Bell Inn'' (nowadays ''The Bell Hotel''), owned in the early 18th century by the high-church Helwys family, became the central rendezvous of the Norwich Revolution Society in the 1790s.{{sfn |Jewson |1975 |p=38}}\n\nBritain's first provincial newspaper, the ''[[Norwich Post]]'', appeared in 1701. By 1726 there were rival Whig and Tory presses, and as early as mid-century, three-quarters of the males in some parishes were literate.{{efn |1=Quoted by {{harvnb |Knights |2004 |pp=181\u2013182}}}} The Norwich municipal library claims an excellent collection of these newspapers, also a folio collection of scrapbooks on 18th-century Norwich politics, which Knights says are \"valuable and important\". Norwich alehouses had 281 clubs and societies meeting in them in 1701, and at least 138 more were formed before 1758. The [[Theatre Royal, Norwich|Theatre Royal]] opened in 1758, alongside the city's stage productions in inns and puppet shows in rowdy alehouses.{{sfn |Chandler |1998}}{{sfn |Blackwell |Blackwell |2007 |loc=Chap 2}} In 1750 Norwich could boast nine booksellers and after 1780 a \"growing number of circulating and subscription libraries\".{{sfn |Dain |2004}} {{harvnb |Knights |2004}} says: \"[All this] made for a lively political culture, in which independence from governmental lines was particularly strong, evident in campaigns against the war with America and for reform... in which trade and the impact of war with [[Revolutionary France]] were key ingredients. The open and contestable structure of local government, the press, the clubs and societies, and dissent all ensured that politics overlapped with communities bound by economics, religion, ideology and print in a world in which public opinion could not be ignored.\"{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}}\n\n[[File:OctagonChapel.JPG|thumb|left|The Octagon Chapel]]\nAmid this metropolitan culture, the city burghers had built a sophisticated political structure. Freemen, who had the right to trade and to vote at elections, numbered about 2,000 in 1690, rising to over 3,300 by the mid-1730s. With growth partly the result of political manipulation, their numbers did at one point reach one-third of the adult male population.{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}} This was notoriously the age of [[rotten borough|\"rotten\"]] and [[pocket borough|\"pocket\"]] boroughs, and Norwich was unusual in having such a high proportion of its citizens able to vote. \"Of the political centres where the Jacobin propaganda had penetrated most deeply only Norwich and Nottingham had a franchise deep enough to allow radicals to make use of the electoral process.\"{{sfn |Thompson |1968 |p=513}} \"Apart from London, Norwich was probably still the largest of those boroughs which were democratically governed,\" says {{harvnb |Jewson |1975}}, describing other towns under the control of a single [[fief]]dom. In Norwich, he says, a powerful Anglican establishment, symbolised by the Cathedral and the great church of St Peter Mancroft was matched by scarcely less powerful [[wikt:congeries|congeries]] of Dissenters headed by the wealthy literate body [of Unitarians] worshipping at the [[Octagon Chapel, Norwich|Octagon Chapel]].{{sfn |Jewson |1975}}\n\n[[File:Map of Norwich 1781.jpg|thumb|Map of Norwich 1781]]\nIn the middle of political disorders of the late 18th century, Norwich intellectual life flourished. It contained one, so far unmentioned aspect: [[Harriet Martineau]] wrote of the city's ''literati'' of the period, including such people as [[William Taylor (scholar)|William Taylor]], one of England's first scholars of German. The city \"boasted of her intellectual supper-parties, where, amidst a pedantry which would now make laughter hold both his sides, there was much that was pleasant and salutary: and finally she called herself ''The Athens of England''.\"{{sfn |Martineau |1869}}\n\n[[File:St Peter Mancroft.jpg|thumb|[[St Peter Mancroft]]]]\nDespite Norwich's hitherto industrial prosperity, the wool trade was experiencing intense competition by the 1790s, from Yorkshire woollens and increasingly from Lancashire cottons. The effects were aggravated by the loss of continental markets after Britain went to war with France in 1793.{{efn |1={{harvnb |Hayes |1958}} Quote: \"a major city manufacturer, and government supporter, Robert Harvey Jr as writing on 12 March 1793: 'The consequences of this just and inevitable war visit this poor city severely and suspend the operations of the Dutch, German and Italian trade and the only lingering employment in the manufactory is the completion of a few Russian orders, and the last China [[camlet|cambletts]] which I hope will find encouragement in the new East India Charter. This languid trade has doubled our poor rate and a voluntary subscription of above \u00a32,000 is found inadequate to the exigencies of the poor.\"}} The early 19th century saw de-industrialisation accompanied by bitter squabbles. The 1820s were marked by wage cuts and personal recrimination against owners. So amid the rich commercial and cultural heritage of its recent past, Norwich suffered in the 1790s from incipient decline exacerbated by a serious trade recession.\n\nAs early in the war as 1793, a major city manufacturer and government supporter, Robert Harvey, complained of low order books, languid trade and doubling of the poor rate.{{efn |1=Quotations and facts from {{harvtxt |Wilson |2004b}}}} Like many of their Norwich forebears, the hungry poor took their complaints onto the streets. Hayes describes a meeting of 200 people in a Norwich public house, where \"Citizen Stanhope\" spoke.{{efn|1=Lord Stanhope was a radical peer, seen by many at the time as a dangerous menace. He is said to have given his rabble-rousing speech in a Norwich public house in 1794.}} The gathering \"[roared its] applause at Stanhope's declaration that the Ministers, unless they changed their policy, deserved to have their heads brought to the block; \u2013 and if there was a people still in England, the event might turn out to be so.\" Hayes says that \"the outbreak of war, in bringing the worsted manufacture almost to a standstill and so plunging the mass of the Norwich weavers into sudden distress made it almost inevitable that a crude appeal to working-class resentment should take the place of a temperate process of education which the earliest reformers had intended.\"{{sfn |Hayes |1958 |pp=242\u2013243}}\n\nAt this period opposition to Pitt's government and their war came \u2013 in their case almost unanimously \u2013 from a circle of radical Dissenting intellectuals of interest in their own right They included the Rigby, Taylor, Aitkin, Barbold, and Alderson families \u2013 all Unitarians, and some of the Quaker Gurneys, one of whose girls, Elizabeth, was under her married name of Fry to be noted campaigner for prison reform. Their activities included visits to revolutionary France (before the execution of Louis XVI), the earliest British research into German literature, studies on medical science, petitioning for parliamentary reform, and publishing a highbrow literary magazine called \"The Cabinet\", in 1795. Their blend of politics, religion and social campaigning was suspicious to Pitt and Windham, causing Pitt to denounce Norwich as \"the Jacobin city\". Edmund Burke attacked John Gurney in print for sponsoring anti-war protests. Politics aside, it is safe to say that Norwich was the most active intellectual hotbed outside London in the 1790s, and did not retrieve comparable prominence until the University of East of Anglia arrived in the late 20th century.<ref>Sources: C.

In April that year, the Norwich Patriotic Society was founded, its manifesto declaring \"that the great end of civil society was general happiness; that every individual had a right to share in the government.\"{{sfn |Jewson |1975 |p=66}} In December the price of bread reached a new peak, and in May 1796, when William Windham was forced to seek re-election after his appointment as war secretary, he only just held his seat.{{efn |1=Before the 20th century it was the practice for a sitting member to seek re-election if appointed to ministerial office.}} Amid the disorder and violence so often in Norwich elections, it was only by the narrowest margin that the radical Bartlett Gurney (\"Peace and Gurney \u2013 No More War \u2013 No more Barley Bread\") failed to unseat him.{{sfn |Thompson |1994}}\n\nThough informed by issues of recent national importance, the bipartisan political culture of Norwich in the 1790s cannot be divorced from local tradition. Two features stand out from a political continuum of three centuries. The first is a dichotomous power balance. From at least the time of the Reformation, Norwich was recorded as a \"two-party city\". In the mid-16th century, the weaving parishes fell under the control of opposition forces, as Kett's rebels held the north of the river, in support of poor clothworkers. Indeed there seems to be a case for saying that with this tradition of two-sided disputation, the city had steadily developed an infrastructure, evident in its many cultural and institutional networks of politics, religion, society, news media and the arts, whereby argument could be managed short of outright confrontation. Indeed at a time of hunger and tension on the Norwich streets, with alehouse crowds ready to have \"a Minister's head brought to the block\", the Anglican and Dissenting clergy exerted themselves to conduct a collegiate dialogue, seeking common ground and reinforcing the well-mannered civic tradition of earlier periods.\n\n[[File:Surrey House on Surrey Street - geograph.org.uk - 22919.jpg|thumb|left|[[Surrey House]], historic headquarters of the Norwich Union insurance company]]\nIn 1797 [[Thomas Bignold]], a 36-year-old wine merchant and banker, founded the first [[Norwich Union|Norwich Union Society]]. Some years earlier, when he moved from Kent to Norwich, Bignold had been unable to find anyone willing to insure him against the threat from highwaymen. With the entrepreneurial thought that nothing was impossible, and aware that in a city built largely of wood the threat of fire was uppermost in people's minds, Bignold formed the \"Norwich Union Society for the Insurance of Houses, Stock and Merchandise from Fire\". The new business, which became known as the Norwich Union Fire Insurance Office, was a \"mutual\" enterprise. [[Aviva|Norwich Union]] was later to become the country's largest insurance giant.\n\nFrom earliest times Norwich was a textile centre. In the 1780s the manufacture of Norwich [[shawl]]s became an important industry<ref>[http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/Research/Academic_Articles/Social_History/Norwich_Shawls/index.htm Norfolk Museums & Archaeology Service website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324192534/http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/Research/Academic_Articles/Social_History/Norwich_Shawls/index.htm |date=24 March 2012}} \u2014 \"Norwich Shawls\"</ref> and remained so for nearly a hundred years. The shawls were a high-quality fashion product and rivalled those of other towns such as [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], which had entered shawl manufacturing in about 1805, some 20 or more years after Norwich. With changes in women's fashion in the later [[Victorian period]], the popularity of shawls declined and eventually manufacture ceased. Examples of Norwich shawls are now sought after by collectors of textiles.\n\nNorwich's geographical isolation was such that until 1845, when a railway link was established, it was often quicker to travel to [[Amsterdam]] by boat than to London.

This was in fact significantly under the actual amount, and the highest number of pubs in the city was in the year 1870, with over 780 beer-houses. A Licensing Act in 1872, had several detrimental effects for landlords and customers, with the total number of pubs dropping to 634.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} A \"Drink Map\" was produced in 1892 by the Norwich and Norfolk Gospel Temperance Union, which showed 631 pubs in and around the city centre and surrounding districts.

Industry and the rail infrastructure also suffered. The heaviest raids occurred on the nights of 27/28 and 29/30 April 1942; as part of the [[Baedeker raids]] (so-called because Baedeker's series of tourist guides to the [[British Isles]] were used to select propaganda-rich targets of cultural and historic significance rather than strategic importance). [[Lord Haw-Haw]] made reference to the imminent destruction of Norwich's new [[City Hall, Norwich|City Hall]] (completed in 1938), although in the event it survived unscathed. Significant targets hit included the Morgan's Brewery building, [[Colman's]] [[Wincarnis]] works, [[Norwich City railway station|City Station]], the Mackintosh chocolate factory, and shopping areas including St Stephen's St and St Benedict's St, the site of Bond's [[department store]] (now [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]]) and Curl's department store.\n\n229 citizens were killed in the two [[Baedeker Blitz|Baedeker raids]] with 1000 others injured, and 340 by bombing throughout the war\u2014giving Norwich the highest air raid casualties in Eastern England.

However, the ten years between 1960 and 1970 completely altered the city, and significantly large areas of Norwich were cleared to make way for modern redevelopment.\n\nIn 1960, the inner-city district of Richmond, locally known as 'the Village on the Hill' was condemned as slums, and many residents were forced to leave due to [[compulsory purchase order]]s on the old terraces and lanes. The whole borough was demolished, which consisted of around 56 acres of existing streets, including 833 dwellings (612 considered unfit for human habitation), 42 shops, four offices, 22 public houses and two schools.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/views/derek-james/returning-to-the-lost-village-on-the-hill-in-old-norwich-1-1697965 |title=Returning to the lost \"village on the hill\" in old Norwich |last=James |first=Derek |work=Norwich Evening News |access-date=2018-08-30 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180830110811/http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/views/derek-james/returning-to-the-lost-village-on-the-hill-in-old-norwich-1-1697965 |archive-date=30 August 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> Communities were moved to high-rise buildings such as Normandie Tower and new housing estates such as the Tuckswood Estate, which were being built at the time. A new road, Rouen Road was developed in the area's place, which consists mainly of light industrial units and council flats. [[Ber Street, Norwich|Ber Street]], a once historical main road into the city had its whole eastern side demolished. The final part of St Peters Street (opposite [[St Peter Mancroft]] church), along with large Georgian townhouses at the top of Bethel Street were demolished to make way for the new City Library in 1961.<ref name=\"oldcity.org.uk\"/> This burnt down in April 1994 and was replaced in 2001 with [[The Forum, Norwich|The Forum]].\n\nMany more buildings were demolished during the construction of the inner ring-road, which saw an ancient road junction \u2013 Stump Cross with Tudor and Georgian buildings in Magdalen Street, Botolph Street, St George's Street and most notably Pitt Street \u2013 cleared to make way for a fly-over and [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] concrete shopping centre, [[Anglia Square Shopping Centre, Norwich|Anglia Square]] and office blocks such as HMSO building Sovereign House. Other areas affected by the ring-road were Grapes Hill, a once narrow lane lined with 19th-century workers cottages, which was cleared and widened into a dual carriageway leading into a roundabout. Shortly before construction of this roundabout, the city's old [[Chapel Field Road drill hall, Norwich|Drill Hall]] was demolished, along with sections of the original city wall and other larger townhouses along the start of Unthank Road (named after the Unthank family, who were local landowners).<ref>{{Cite web |last1=James |first1=Derek |title=The real story behind Unthank Road |url=https://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/views/norwich-golden-triangle-unthank-derek-james-1-5352280 |website=Evening News |access-date=25 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190125184433/https://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/views/norwich-golden-triangle-unthank-derek-james-1-5352280 |archive-date=25 January 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The north-westerly corner of Chapelfield Gardens was also cut off to accommodate the new roundabout. About a mile of Georgian houses along Chapelfield Road and Queens Road; which included many houses that were built into the city walls, were bulldozed in 1964. This included the surrounding district off Vauxhall Street, consisting of swathes of terrace housing which were condemned as slums. Post-war housing and maisonettes flats now stand where the [[Rookery (slum)|Rookery slums]] once did. Some aspects of The '45 Plan were put into action, which saw large three-story Edwardian houses in Grove Avenue and Grove Road, and other large properties on Southwell Road, demolished in 1962 to make way for flat-roofed single-story style maisonettes that still stand today.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://norfolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/FULL/PICNOR/BIBENQ/155332801/2219614,5?FMT=IMG|title=Spydus - Image Display \u2013 Record 5 of 8 |website=Civica |publisher=Norfolk County Council |language=en |access-date=2018-09-09}}</ref> [[Heigham (Norwich)|Heigham]] Hall, a large Victorian manor house off Old Palace Road was also demolished in 1963, to build Dolphin Grove flats.\n\nOther housing developments in the private and public sector took place after the Second World War, partly to accommodate the growing population of the city and to replace condemned and bomb-damaged areas, such as the [[Heigham (Norwich)|Heigham Grove]] district between Barn Road and Old Palace Road, and West Pottergate off Dereham Road/Earlham Road. Other central streets such as St Stephens Street was widened, firstly by [[Norwich Union]]'s new office blocks and shortly after with new buildings, after it suffered extensive damage during the [[Baedeker Blitz|Baedeker raids]]. In Surrey Street, many six-storey Georgian buildings were demolished to make way for Norwich Union's office. Other notable buildings that were lost were three theatres, the Norwich Hippodrome on St Giles Street, which is now a multi-storey car park, the Grosvenor Rooms and Electric Theatre in Prince of Wales Road, the Corn Hall in Exchange Street, the Free Library in Duke Street and the Great Eastern Hotel, which faced [[Norwich railway station|Norwich Station]].

The [[Theatre Royal, Norwich|Theatre Royal]] is the largest and has been on its present site for nearly 250 years, through several rebuildings and many alterations. It has 1,300 seats and hosts a mix of national touring productions including musicals, dance, drama, family shows, stand-up comedians, opera and pop.\n\nThe [[Maddermarket Theatre]] opened in 1921 as the first permanent recreation of an [[Elizabethan theatre]]. The founder was [[Nugent Monck]] who had worked with [[William Poel]]. The theatre is a [[Shakespearean]]-style playhouse and has a [[seating capacity]] of 310. [[Norwich Puppet Theatre]] was founded in 1979 by Ray and Joan DaSilva as a permanent base for their touring company and was first opened as a public venue in 1980, following the conversion of the medieval church of St. James in the heart of Norwich. Under subsequent artistic directors \u2014 Barry Smith and Luis Z. Boy \u2014 the theatre established its current pattern of operation. It is a nationally unique venue dedicated to puppetry, and currently houses a 185-seat raked auditorium, the 50-seat Octagon Studio, workshops, an exhibition gallery, shop and licensed bar. It is the only theatre in the Eastern region with a year-round programme of family-centred entertainment. [[Norwich Arts Centre]] theatre opened in 1977 in St Benedict's Street, and has a capacity of 290. The [[Norwich Playhouse]], which opened in 1995 and has a [[seating capacity]] of 300, is a venue in the heart of the city and one of the most modern performance spaces of its size in East Anglia.\n\nThe Garage studio theatre can seat up to 110 people in a range of layouts. It can also be used for standing events to accommodate up to 180 people. Platform Theatre is in the grounds of the City College Norwich. Productions are staged mainly during the autumn and summer months. The theatre is raked and seats about 250 people. On 20 April 2012, the theatre held a large relaunch event with an evening performance, show-casing it at its best with previews of upcoming performances and scenes from some of its past performances.<ref>[http://www.ccn.ac.uk/news/new-building-boost-creative-arts-city-college-norwich City College Norwich] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406070519/http://www.ccn.ac.uk/news/new-building-boost-creative-arts-city-college-norwich |date=6 April 2012}} Retrieved 23 March 2012</ref>\n\nThe Whiffler Theatre was built in 1981 and was given to the people of Norwich by the local newspaper group Eastern Daily Press. It is an open-air facility in Norwich Castle Gardens, with fixed-raked seating for up to 80 people and standing for another 30 on the balcony. The stage is brick-built and has its dressing-rooms set in a small building to stage left. The Whiffler mainly plays host to small Shakespeare productions. [[Sewell Barn Theatre]] is the smallest theatre in Norwich and has a [[seating capacity]] of just 100. The auditorium features raked seating on three sides of an open acting space. This unusual staging helps to draw the audience closer into the performance.\n\nPublic performance spaces include the Forum in the city centre, which has a large open-air [[amphitheatre]], hosting performances of many types throughout the year. Additionally, the [[cloister]]s of Norwich Cathedral are used for open-air performances as part of an annual Shakespeare festival.<ref>[http://www.cathedral.org.uk/whats-on/shakespeare-in-the-cloisters-2013-tour.aspx Shakespeare in the cloisters] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121155413/http://www.cathedral.org.uk/whats-on/shakespeare-in-the-cloisters-2013-tour.aspx |date=21 January 2013}} Retrieved 13 December 2012</ref>\n\n===Museums===\nNorwich has a number of important museums which reflect the rich history of the city and of Norfolk, as well as wider interests.

[[Independent radio]] stations based in Norwich include [[Heart Norwich|Heart]], [[Smooth Radio]], [[99.9 Radio Norwich]], and the University of East Anglia's Livewire 1350, an online station. A community station, [[Future Radio]], was launched on 6 August 2007.\n\n[[ITV Anglia]], formerly [[Anglia Television]], is based in Norwich. Although one of the smaller ITV companies, it supplied the network with some of its most popular shows such as ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (TV series)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'', ''[[Survival (TV series)|Survival]]'' and ''[[Sale of the Century (UK game show)|Sale of the Century]]'' (1971\u20131983), which began each edition with [[John Benson (announcer)|John Benson]]'s enthusiastic announcement: \"And now from Norwich, it's the quiz of the week!\" The company also had a subsidiary called Anglia Multimedia, which produced educational content on CD and DVD mainly for schools, and was one of the three companies, along with [[Granada TV]] and the [[BBC]] vying for the right to produce a digital television station for English schools and colleges.\n\nLaunched in 1959, Anglia Television lost its independence in 1994 following a takeover by [[Meridian Broadcasting]] and subsequent mergers have seen it reduced from a significant producer of programmes to a regional news centre. The company is still based in Anglia House, the former Norfolk and Norwich Agricultural Hall, on Agricultural Hall Plain near Prince of Wales Road. However, despite the contraction of Anglia, television production in Norwich has by no means ended. Anglia's former network production centre at Magdalen Street has been taken over by Norfolk County Council and extensively re-vamped. After a total investment of \u00a34&nbsp;million from the East of England Development Agency (EEDA) it has re-opened as Epic Studios (East of England Production Innovation Centre). Degree courses in film and video are also run at the centre by Norwich University of the Arts. Epic has commercial, broadcast quality post-production facilities, a real-time virtual studio and a smaller HD discussion studio. The main studio opened as an HD facility in November 2008. Throughout 2008, the centre has concentrated on the development of new TV formats and has worked on pilot shows with Les Dennis, Gaby Roslin and Christopher Biggins.\n\n[[Archant]] publishes two daily newspapers in Norwich, the ''[[Norwich Evening News]]'', and the regional ''[[Eastern Daily Press]]'' (EDP), and had its own television operation, [[Mustard TV]], which has now closed after being bought out by the [[That's TV]] group.

It was the home of [[William Cuningham]], a physician who published ''An Invective Epistle in Defense of Astrologers'' in 1560.<ref>Bryan's Dictionary of Painters and Engravers by Michael Bryan, edited by Robert Edmund Graves and Sir Walter Armstrong, an 1886\u20131889 publication now in the public domain</ref> The [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] dramatist [[Robert Greene (dramatist)|Robert Greene]], author of [[Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay]], was born in Norwich in 1558.

Many influential esoteric books-titles are listed as once in Browne's [[Library of Sir Thomas Browne#Esoteric|library]].<ref>Catalogue of the libraries of Sir Thomas Browne and his son Edward Browne, edited with an introduction by J.

Translated from Latin it reads, ''Great Virtues, &hellip; sleeping here the dust of his [[spagyric]] body converts the lead to gold''. Browne is also a significant figure in the history of [[physiognomy]].\n\nThe [[Church of St John Maddermarket]]'s graveyard includes the Crabtree headstone, which has the pre-Christian symbol of the [[Ouroboros]] along with [[Masonic]] [[Square and Compasses]] carved upon it.

Notable examples of [[Secularity|secular]] medieval architecture are [[Dragon Hall, Norwich|Dragon Hall]], built in about 1430, and [[Norwich Guildhall|The Guildhall]], built 1407\u20131413, with later additions. From the 18th century, the pre-eminent local name is [[Thomas Ivory]], who built the Assembly Rooms (1776), the Octagon Chapel (1756), St Helen's House (1752) in the grounds of the [[Great Hospital]], and innovative speculative housing in Surrey Street (c. 1761). Ivory should not be confused with the Irish architect of the same name and similar period.\n\nThe 19th century saw an explosion in Norwich's size and much of its housing stock, as well as commercial building in the city centre, dates from this period. The local architect of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] periods who has continued to command most critical respect was [[George Skipper]] (1856\u20131948). Examples of his work include the headquarters of [[Norwich Union]] on Surrey Street; the [[Art Nouveau]] Royal Arcade; and the Hotel de Paris in the nearby seaside town of [[Cromer]]. The [[neo-Gothic]] Roman Catholic [[St John the Baptist Cathedral, Norwich|cathedral]] dedicated to [[St John the Baptist]] on [[Earlham Road]], begun in 1882, is by [[George Gilbert Scott Junior]] and his brother, [[John Oldrid Scott]].\n\nThe city continued to grow through the 20th century, and much housing, particularly in areas further out from the city centre, dates from that century. The first notable building post-Skipper was the [[City Hall, Norwich|City Hall]] by CH James and SR Pierce, opened in 1938; at the same time, they moved the [[Norwich War Memorial|City War Memorial]], designed by [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]], to sit in a memorial garden between the city hall and the market place. Bombing during the Second World War, while resulting in relatively little loss of life, caused significant damage to the housing stock in the city centre. Much of the postwar replacement stock was designed by the local-authority architect, David Percival. However, the major postwar development in Norwich from an architectural point of view was the opening of the [[University of East Anglia]] in 1964. Originally designed by [[Denys Lasdun]] (his design was never completely executed), it has been added to over subsequent decades by major names such as [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]] and [[Rick Mather]].\n\n<gallery heights=\"132\" mode=\"packed\">\nNorwichcathedral2.jpg|Norwich Cathedral lies close to Tombland in the city centre.\nElmHill.jpg|[[Elm Hill, Norwich|Elm Hill]] is an intact medieval street.\nCowtower.jpg|[[Cow Tower, Norwich|Cow Tower]] stands on the banks of the River Wensum.\nGentlemanswalk.JPG|The varying styles of architecture along Gentleman's Walk\n</gallery>\n\n===Parks, gardens and open spaces===\n[[File:Riverside Flats Norwich - geograph.org.uk - 73621.jpg|thumb|Riverside flats Norwich]]\n''See also [[List of parks, gardens and open spaces in Norwich]]''\n\nChapelfield Gardens in central Norwich became the city's first [[public park]] in November 1880.

In the 2018\u20132019 season it finished first in the second tier of English football, the Championship, earning promotion to the Premier League for the 2019-2020 season. Majority-owned by celebrity chef [[Delia Smith]] and her husband Michael Wynn-Jones, its ground is the [[Carrow Road|Carrow Road Stadium]]. It has a strong [[East Anglian Derby|East Anglian rivalry]] with [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. The club has enjoyed considerable success in the past, having played in the top division regularly since 1972, its longest spell being a nine-year run from 1986 to 1995. It has also won two [[Football League Cup]]s and finished third in the inaugural [[Premier League]] in 1993. Norwich City FC was relegated two years later and did not reclaim its top-flight place for nine years, going down again after just one season, only to return in 2011 after two successive promotions.\n\nPerhaps Norwich City's most famous result to date came later in 1993, when it eliminated the German giants [[Bayern Munich]] from the [[UEFA Cup]], in what is to date its only season in European competitions; it had qualified for the UEFA Cup three times between 1985 and 1989 but they were unable to compete as there was a ban on English clubs in European competitions at the time. Before emerging as a top division club, it famously eliminated [[Manchester United FC|Manchester United]] from the FA Cup in 1959, and went on to reach the semi-finals of the domestic cup competition, a run it achieved again in 1989 and most recently in 1992. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the club produced some of the most highly rated talent of that era, including striker [[Chris Sutton]], winger [[Ruel Fox]], defender [[Andy Linighan]], midfielder [[Mike Phelan]], midfielder [[Tim Sherwood]] and striker [[Justin Fashanu]]. The club's most successful managers have included [[Kenneth Brown (footballer born 1934)|Ken Brown]], [[Ron Saunders]], [[Dave Stringer]], [[Mike Walker (Welsh footballer)|Mike Walker]], [[Nigel Worthington]] and [[Paul Lambert]].\n\nThe city's second club, [[Norwich United FC|Norwich United]] (which is based in [[Blofield]] some {{convert|5|mi|km}} east of the city), along with [[Norwich CBS FC|Norwich CBS]], plays in the [[Eastern Counties Football League|Eastern Counties League]].

City, farewell: I mourn thy cruel fate''.\n\n[[Thomas Fuller]] in his ''The Worthies of England'' described the City in 1662 as:\n: ''Either a city in an orchard or an orchard in a city, so equally are houses and trees blended in it, so that the pleasure of the country and the populousness of the city meet here together. Yet in this mixture, the inhabitants participate nothing of the rusticalness of the one, but altogether the urbanity and civility of the other''.\n\n[[Celia Fiennes]] (1662\u20131741) visited Norwich in 1698 and described it as\n: '' a city walled full round of towers, except on the river side which serves as a wall; they seem the best in repair of any walled city I know''. She also records that three times a year the city held:\n: ''great fairs. &hellip; to which resort a vast concourse of people and wares a full trade'', Norwich being ''a rich, thriving industrious place full of weaving, knitting and dyeing''.\n\n[[Daniel Defoe]] in his ''Tour of the whole Island of Great Britain'' (1724) wrote:\n: ''the inhabitants being all busy at their manufactures, dwell in their garrets at their looms, in their combing-shops, so they call them, twisting-mills, and other work-houses; almost all the works they are employed in being done within doors''.\n\n[[John Evelyn]] (1620\u20131706), royalist, traveller and diarist, wrote to [[Sir Thomas Browne]]:\n: '' I hear Norwich is a place very much addicted to the flowery part''. He visited the City as a courtier to [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] in 1671 and described it thus:\n: ''The suburbs are large, the prospect sweet, and other amenities, not omitting the flower-garden, which all the Inhabitants excel in of this City, the fabric of stuffs, which affords the Merchants, and brings a vast trade to this populous Town''.\n[[James Woodforde]] (1740\u20131803), clergyman, on his first visit to Norwich, wrote in his Diary on 14 April 1775:\n\n: ''We took a walk over the City in the morning, and we both agreed that it was the finest City in England by far, in the center of it is a high Hill and on that a prodigious large old Castle almost perfect and forms a compleat square, round it is a fine Terrass Walk which commands the whole City. There are in the City 36 noble Churches mostly built with flint, besides many meeting Houses of divers sorts. A noble River runs almost thro the Center of the City. The City walls are also very perfect and all round the City but where the River is. On the Hills round the City stand many Wind Mills about a dozen, to be seen from Castle Mount''.\n[[George Borrow]] in his semi-autobiographical novel [[Lavengro]] (1851) wrote of Norwich as:\n: ''A fine old city, perhaps the most curious specimen at present extant of the genuine old English Town &hellip;.There it spreads from north to south, with its venerable houses, its numerous gardens, its thrice twelve churches, its mighty mound....There is an old grey castle on top of that mighty mound: and yonder rising three hundred feet above the soil, from amongst those noble forest trees, behold that old Norman master-work, that cloud-enriched cathedral spire.... Now who can wonder that the children of that fine old city are proud, and offer up prayers for her prosperity?''\n\nBorrow wrote far less favourably of the City in his translation of [[Faust]]:\n: ''They found the people of the place modelled after so unsightly a pattern, with such ugly figures and flat features that the devil owned he had never seen them equalled, except by the inhabitants of an English town, called Norwich, when dressed in their Sunday's best''.\n\nIn 1812, Andrew Robertson wrote to the painter [[Constable]]:\n: ''I arrived here a week ago and find it a place where the arts are very much cultivated &hellip; some branches of knowledge, chemistry, botany, etc. are carried to a great length. General literature seems to be pursued with an ardour which is astonishing when we consider that it does not contain a university, as is merely a manufacturing town.''\n\nIn 1962, [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Sir Nikolaus Pevsner]] stated in his North-West Norfolk and Norwich volume of ''[[The Buildings of England]]'' that:\n: ''Norwich is distinguished by a prouder sense of civic responsibility than any other town of about the same size in Britain.''\n\n==Notable people==\n[[File:Thomas Browne statue.jpg|thumb|Statue of Sir [[Thomas Browne]] on Hay Hill, near to where he lived.

According to a local rhyme, the demise of ''Venta Icenorum'' led to the development of Norwich: \"Caistor was a city when Norwich was none, Norwich was built of Caistor stone.\"{{sfn |Morley |2006}}\n\n===Early English and Norman conquest===\n[[File:Norwich Cathedral, spire and south transept.jpg|thumb|[[Norwich Cathedral]] is one of the great Norman buildings of England.]]\nThere are two suggested models of development for Norwich. It is possible that three separate early Anglo-Saxon settlements, one north of the river and two either side on the south, joined together as they grew or that one Anglo-Saxon settlement, north of the river, emerged in the mid-7th century after the abandonment of the previous three. The ancient city was a thriving centre for trade and commerce in East Anglia in 1004 when it was raided and burnt by [[Sweyn I of Denmark|Swein Forkbeard]] the [[Viking]] king of Denmark. [[Mercia]]n coins and shards of pottery from the [[Rhineland]] dating from the 8th century suggest that long-distance trade was happening long before this. Between 924 and 939, Norwich became fully established as a town, with its own mint. The word ''Norvic'' appears on coins across Europe minted during this period, in the reign of [[Athelstan|King Athelstan]]. The Vikings were a strong cultural influence in Norwich for 40 to 50 years at the end of the 9th century, setting up an [[Anglo-Scandinavian]] district near the north end of present-day King Street. At the time of the [[Norman Conquest]], the city was one of the largest in England. The [[Domesday Book]] states that it had approximately 25 churches and a population of between 5,000 and 10,000. It also records the site of an Anglo-Saxon church in Tombland, the site of the Saxon market place and the later [[Norwich Cathedral|Norman cathedral]]. Norwich continued to be a major centre for trade, the River Wensum being a convenient export route to the [[River Yare]] and [[Great Yarmouth]], which served as the [[Port of Norwich|port for Norwich]]. [[Quern stone]]s and other artefacts from Scandinavia and the Rhineland have been found during excavations in Norwich city centre. These date from the 11th century onwards.\n\n[[File:Norwich Castle.jpg|thumb|[[Norwich Castle]]'s 12th-century keep]]\n[[Norwich Castle]] was founded soon after the Norman Conquest.<ref>{{PastScape |mnumber=132268 |mname=Norwich Castle |accessdate=29 December 2010}}</ref> The [[Domesday Book]] records that 98 Saxon homes were demolished to make way for the castle.{{sfn |Harfield |1991 |pp=373, 384}} The [[Normans]] established a new focus of settlement around the Castle and the area to the west of it: this became known as the \"New\" or \"French\" borough, centred on the Normans' own market place, which survives today as Norwich Market. In 1096, [[Herbert de Losinga]], [[Bishop of Thetford]], began construction of [[Norwich Cathedral]]. The chief building material for the Cathedral was limestone, imported from Caen in Normandy. To transport the building stone to the site, a canal was cut from the river (from the site of present-day Pulls Ferry) up to the east wall. Herbert de Losinga then moved his [[Episcopal see|See]] there, to what became the cathedral church for the [[Anglican Diocese of Norwich|Diocese of Norwich]]. The Bishop of Norwich still signs himself ''Norvic''. Norwich received a [[royal charter]] from [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] in 1158, and another from [[Richard I of England|Richard ''the Lionheart'']] in 1194. After a riot in the city in 1274, Norwich has the distinction of being the only complete English city to be excommunicated by the Pope.{{sfn |Blomefield |1806}}\n\n===Middle Ages===\nThe first recorded presence of [[Jews]] in Norwich is 1134.<ref name=\"heritagecity1\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.heritagecity.org/research-centre/churches-and-creeds/jews-in-norwich.htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130806235625/http://www.heritagecity.org/research-centre/churches-and-creeds/jews-in-norwich.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 August 2013 |title=Jews in Norwich |publisher=Heritagecity.org |accessdate=13 September 2013}}</ref> In 1144, the Jews of Norwich were falsely accused of [[ritual murder]] after a boy ([[William of Norwich]]) was found dead with stab wounds.<ref name=\"heritagecity1\"/> William acquired the status of martyr and was subsequently [[canonization|canonised]]. Pilgrims made offerings to a shrine at the Cathedral (largely finished by 1140) up to the 16th century, but the records suggest there were few of them.{{sfn |Nilson |2001 |p=157}} In 1174, Norwich was sacked by the [[Flemish people|Flemings]]. In February 1190, all the Jews of Norwich were massacred except for a few who found refuge in the castle. At the site of a medieval well, the bones of 17 individuals, including 11 children, were found in 2004 by workers preparing the ground for construction of a Norwich shopping centre. The remains were determined by [[forensic science|forensic scientists]] to be most probably the remains of such murdered Jews, and a [[Genetic genealogy|DNA]] expert determined that the victims were all related, so that they probably came from one [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi Jewish]] family.{{sfn |Jewish Telegraphic Agency |2011}} The study of the remains featured in an episode of the [[BBC Television|BBC television]] documentary series ''[[History Cold Case]]''.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=The Bodies in the Well |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0125kbf |series=History Cold Case |network=[[BBC HD]] |airdate=28 June 2011 |seriesno=2 |number=3 |access-date=25 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816170740/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0125kbf |archivedate=16 August 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ethelbert Gate from Tombland, Norwich, UK.jpg|thumb|St Ethelbert's Gate at Tombland was built as penance for riots which occurred in the 1270s.]]\nIn 1216, the castle fell to Louis, Dauphin of France and Hildebrand's Hospital was founded, followed ten years later by the [[Franciscan]] Friary and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Friary. The Great Hospital dates from 1249 and the College of St Mary in the Field from 1250. In 1256, Whitefriars was founded. In 1266 the city was sacked by the \"Disinherited\". It has the distinction of being the only English city ever to be excommunicated, following a riot between citizens and monks in 1274.{{sfn |Blomefield |1806}} As a penance, St Ethelbert's Gate, one of the entrances to the cathedral priory, was constructed by Norwich citizens. In 1278 the Cathedral received final consecration. In 1290 the city flooded. Austin Friary was founded in that year.\n\nThe engine of trade was [[wool]] from Norfolk's [[sheepwalk]]s. Wool made England rich, and the [[staple right|staple port]] of Norwich \"in her state doth stand With towns of high'st regard the fourth of all the land\", as [[Michael Drayton]] noted in ''[[Poly-Olbion]]'' (1612). The wealth generated by the [[wool#History|wool trade]] throughout the [[Middle Ages]] financed the construction of many fine churches, so that Norwich still has more medieval churches than any other city in Western Europe north of the [[Alps]]. Throughout this period Norwich established wide-ranging trading links with other parts of Europe, its markets stretching from [[Scandinavia]] to Spain and the city housing a [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] warehouse. To organise and control its exports to the [[Low Countries]], Great Yarmouth, as the port for Norwich, was designated one of the staple ports under the terms of the 1353 [[Statute of the Staple]].\n\nFrom 1280 to 1340 the [[defensive wall|city walls]] were built. At around {{convert|2 + 1/2|mi|km|}}, these walls, along with the river, enclosed a larger area than that of the [[City of London]]. However, when the city walls were constructed it was made illegal to build outside them, inhibiting expansion of the city. Around this time, the city was made a [[county corporate]] and became the seat of one of the most densely populated and prosperous [[ancient counties of England|counties]] of England. Part of these walls remain standing today.\n\n===Early modern period (1485\u20131640)===\nHand-in-hand with the wool industry, this key religious centre experienced a Reformation significantly different to other parts of England. The magistracy in Tudor Norwich unusually found ways of managing religious discord whilst maintaining civic harmony.{{sfn |McClendon |1999}}\n\n[[File:John Crome 002.jpg|thumb|''Mousehold Heath, Norwich'' by Norfolk-based artist [[John Crome]]]]The summer of 1549 saw an unprecedented rebellion in Norfolk. Unlike popular challenges elsewhere in the Tudor period, it appears to have been [[Protestant]] in nature. For several weeks, rebels led by [[Robert Kett]] camped outside Norwich on [[Mousehold Heath]] and took control of the city on 29 July 1549 with the support of many of its poorer inhabitants. [[Kett's Rebellion]] was particularly in response to the enclosure of land by landlords, leaving peasants with nowhere to graze their animals and the general abuses of power by the nobility.

In the case of Norwich, this process was underscored later by the arrival of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and [[Flemish people|Flemish]] \"[[Elizabethan Strangers|Strangers]]\" fleeing persecution from the Catholics and eventually numbering as many as one-third of the city's population.{{sfn |Houlbroke |McClendon |2004 |p=257}} Large numbers of such exiles came to the city, especially Flemish Protestants from the Westkwartier (\"Western Quarter\"), a region in the [[Southern Netherlands]] where the first [[Calvinist]] fires of the [[Dutch Revolt]] had spread. Inhabitants of [[Ypres]], in particular, chose Norwich above other destinations.{{sfn |Fagel |2003 |p=52}} Perhaps in response to Kett, Norwich became the first provincial city to initiate compulsory payments for a civic scheme of poor relief, which it has been claimed led to its wider introduction, forming the basis of the later Elizabethan Poor Law of 1597\u20131598.{{sfn |Pound |2004 |pp=50\u201356}}\n\nNorwich has traditionally been the home of various minorities, notably French [[Huguenot]] and Belgian [[Walloons|Walloon]] communities in the 16th and 17th centuries. The great \"stranger\" immigration of 1567 brought a substantial Flemish and Walloon community of Protestant [[weaver (occupation)|weaver]]s to Norwich, where they are said to have been made welcome.{{sfn |Ketton-Cremer |1957}} The merchant's house which was their earliest base in the city \u2014 now a museum \u2014 is still known as [[Strangers' Hall]]. It seems that the strangers integrated into the local community without much animosity, at least among the business fraternity, who had the most to gain from their skills. Their arrival in Norwich boosted trade with mainland Europe and fostered a movement toward religious reform and radical politics in the city. By contrast, after being persecuted by the Anglican church for his [[Puritan]] beliefs, [[Michael Metcalf (puritan)|Michael Metcalf]], a 17th-century Norwich weaver, fled the city and settled in [[Dedham, Massachusetts]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=A New England Town |last=Lockridge |first=Kenneth |year=1985 |publisher=W.

Along with their advanced techniques in textile working, they brought pet canaries which they began to breed locally; eventually becoming, in the 20th century, a mascot of the city and the emblem of its football club, [[Norwich City F.C.]], whose nickname is \"The Canaries\". \n\nPrinting was introduced to the city in 1567 by Anthony de Solempne, one of the strangers, but it did not take root and had died out by about 1572.{{sfn |Stoker |1981}}\n\n===Civil War to Victorian era===\nAcross the Eastern Counties, [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s powerful [[Eastern Association]] was eventually dominant. However, to begin with, there had been a large element of Royalist sympathy within Norwich, which seems to have experienced a continuity of its two-sided political tradition throughout the period. Bishop [[Matthew Wren]] was a forceful supporter of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. Nonetheless, [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] recruitment took hold. The strong Royalist party was stifled by a lack of commitment from the aldermen and isolation from Royalist-held regions.{{sfn |Hopper |2004}} Serious inter-factional disturbances culminated in \"The Great Blow\" of 1648 when Parliamentary forces tried to quell a Royalist riot. The latter's gunpowder was set off by accident in the city centre, causing mayhem. According to Hopper<ref>{{harvnb |Hopper |2004}},</ref> the explosion \"ranks among the largest of the century\". Stoutly defended though East Anglia was by the Parliamentary army, there are said to have been pubs in Norwich where the king's health was still drunk and the name of the Protector sung to ribald verse.\n\nAt the cost of some discomfort to the Mayor, the moderate [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]] was targeted because of his position as Bishop of Norwich.\n\nNorwich was marked in the period after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] of 1660 and the ensuing century by a golden age of its cloth industry, comparable only to those in the [[West Country]] and Yorkshire.{{sfn |Wilson |2004a}} But unlike other cloth-manufacturing regions, Norwich weaving brought greater urbanisation, mainly concentrated in the surrounds of the city itself, creating an urban society, with features such as leisure time, alehouses and other public forums of debate and argument.{{sfn |Wilson |2004b}}\n\n[[File:Original Norfolk and Norwich Hospital - geograph.org.uk - 84361.jpg|thumb|Founded in 1771, the [[Norfolk and Norwich Hospital]] cared for the city's poor and sick. It closed in 2003 after services were moved to the [[Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital]].]]\nWriting of the early 18th century, Pound describes the city's rich cultural life, the winter theatre season, the festivities accompanying the summer assizes, and other popular entertainments. Norwich was the wealthiest town in England, with a sophisticated system of [[poor relief]], and a large influx of foreign refugees.{{sfn |Pound |2004 |p=61}} Despite severe outbreaks of plague, the city had a population of almost 30,000. This made Norwich unique in England, although there were some 50 cities of similar size in Europe. In some, like Lyon and [[Dresden]], this was, as in the case of Norwich, linked to an important proto-industry, such as textiles or china pottery, in some, such as Vienna, Madrid and Dublin, to the city's status as an administrative capital, and in some such as Antwerp, Marseilles and Cologne to a position on an important maritime or river trade route.{{efn|1=For table of city sizes see {{harvtxt |Corfield |2004 |p=143}}}}\n\nNorwich in the late 17th century was riven politically. Churchman [[Humphrey Prideaux]] described \"two factions, [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] and [[Tory]], and both contend for their way with the utmost violence.\"{{sfn |Knights |2004}} Nor did the city accept the outcome of the 1688 [[Glorious Revolution]] with a unified voice. The pre-eminent citizen, Bishop William Lloyd, would not take the oaths of allegiance to the new monarchs. One report has it that in 1704 the landlord of Fowler's alehouse \"with a glass of beer in hand, went down on his knees and drank a health to James the third, wishing the Crowne [sic] well and settled on his head.\"{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174 |quote= \"Never was a city in the miserable kingdom so wretchedly divided as this,\" said the ''London Post''}}\n\nIn 1716, at a play at the ''New Inn'', the Pretender was cheered and the audience booed and hissed every time King George's name was mentioned. In 1722 supporters of the king were said to be \"hiss'd at and curst as they go in the streets,\" and in 1731 \"a Tory mobb, in a great body, went through several parts of this city, in a riotous manner, cursing and abusing such as they knew to be friends of the government.\"{{efn |1=Reports quoted by {{harvnb |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}}}} But the Whigs gradually gained control and by the 1720s they had successfully petitioned Parliament to allow all adult males working in the textile industry to take up the freedom, on the correct assumption that they would vote Whig. But it had the effect of boosting the city's popular Jacobitism, says Knights, and contests of the kind described continued in Norwich well into a period in which political stability had been discerned at a national level. The city's Jacobitism perhaps only ended with 1745, well after it had ceased to be a significant movement outside Scotland.{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}} Despite the Highlanders reaching Derby and Norwich citizens mustering themselves into an association to protect the city, some Tories refused to join in, and the vestry of [[St Peter Mancroft]] resolved that it would not ring its bells to summon the defence. Still, it was the end of the road for Norwich Jacobites, and the Whigs organised a notable celebration after the [[Battle of Culloden]].{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}}\n\nThe events of this period illustrate how Norwich had a strong tradition of popular protest favouring Church and Stuarts and attached to the street and alehouse. Knights tells how in 1716 the mayoral election had ended in a riot, with both sides throwing \"brick-ends and great paving stones\" at each other.{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}} A renowned Jacobite watering-hole, the ''Blue Bell Inn'' (nowadays ''The Bell Hotel''), owned in the early 18th century by the high-church Helwys family, became the central rendezvous of the Norwich Revolution Society in the 1790s.{{sfn |Jewson |1975 |p=38}}\n\nBritain's first provincial newspaper, the ''[[Norwich Post]]'', appeared in 1701. By 1726 there were rival Whig and Tory presses, and as early as mid-century, three-quarters of the males in some parishes were literate.{{efn |1=Quoted by {{harvnb |Knights |2004 |pp=181\u2013182}}}} The Norwich municipal library claims an excellent collection of these newspapers, also a folio collection of scrapbooks on 18th-century Norwich politics, which Knights says are \"valuable and important\". Norwich alehouses had 281 clubs and societies meeting in them in 1701, and at least 138 more were formed before 1758. The [[Theatre Royal, Norwich|Theatre Royal]] opened in 1758, alongside the city's stage productions in inns and puppet shows in rowdy alehouses.{{sfn |Chandler |1998}}{{sfn |Blackwell |Blackwell |2007 |loc=Chap 2}} In 1750 Norwich could boast nine booksellers and after 1780 a \"growing number of circulating and subscription libraries\".{{sfn |Dain |2004}} {{harvnb |Knights |2004}} says: \"[All this] made for a lively political culture, in which independence from governmental lines was particularly strong, evident in campaigns against the war with America and for reform... in which trade and the impact of war with [[Revolutionary France]] were key ingredients. The open and contestable structure of local government, the press, the clubs and societies, and dissent all ensured that politics overlapped with communities bound by economics, religion, ideology and print in a world in which public opinion could not be ignored.\"{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}}\n\n[[File:OctagonChapel.JPG|thumb|left|The Octagon Chapel]]\nAmid this metropolitan culture, the city burghers had built a sophisticated political structure. Freemen, who had the right to trade and to vote at elections, numbered about 2,000 in 1690, rising to over 3,300 by the mid-1730s. With growth partly the result of political manipulation, their numbers did at one point reach one-third of the adult male population.{{sfn |Knights |2004 |pp=168\u2013174}} This was notoriously the age of [[rotten borough|\"rotten\"]] and [[pocket borough|\"pocket\"]] boroughs, and Norwich was unusual in having such a high proportion of its citizens able to vote. \"Of the political centres where the Jacobin propaganda had penetrated most deeply only Norwich and Nottingham had a franchise deep enough to allow radicals to make use of the electoral process.\"{{sfn |Thompson |1968 |p=513}} \"Apart from London, Norwich was probably still the largest of those boroughs which were democratically governed,\" says {{harvnb |Jewson |1975}}, describing other towns under the control of a single [[fief]]dom. In Norwich, he says, a powerful Anglican establishment, symbolised by the Cathedral and the great church of St Peter Mancroft was matched by scarcely less powerful [[wikt:congeries|congeries]] of Dissenters headed by the wealthy literate body [of Unitarians] worshipping at the [[Octagon Chapel, Norwich|Octagon Chapel]].{{sfn |Jewson |1975}}\n\n[[File:Map of Norwich 1781.jpg|thumb|Map of Norwich 1781]]\nIn the middle of political disorders of the late 18th century, Norwich intellectual life flourished. It contained one, so far unmentioned aspect: [[Harriet Martineau]] wrote of the city's ''literati'' of the period, including such people as [[William Taylor (scholar)|William Taylor]], one of England's first scholars of German. The city \"boasted of her intellectual supper-parties, where, amidst a pedantry which would now make laughter hold both his sides, there was much that was pleasant and salutary: and finally she called herself ''The Athens of England''.\"{{sfn |Martineau |1869}}\n\n[[File:St Peter Mancroft.jpg|thumb|[[St Peter Mancroft]]]]\nDespite Norwich's hitherto industrial prosperity, the wool trade was experiencing intense competition by the 1790s, from Yorkshire woollens and increasingly from Lancashire cottons. The effects were aggravated by the loss of continental markets after Britain went to war with France in 1793.{{efn |1={{harvnb |Hayes |1958}} Quote: \"a major city manufacturer, and government supporter, Robert Harvey Jr as writing on 12 March 1793: 'The consequences of this just and inevitable war visit this poor city severely and suspend the operations of the Dutch, German and Italian trade and the only lingering employment in the manufactory is the completion of a few Russian orders, and the last China [[camlet|cambletts]] which I hope will find encouragement in the new East India Charter. This languid trade has doubled our poor rate and a voluntary subscription of above \u00a32,000 is found inadequate to the exigencies of the poor.\"}} The early 19th century saw de-industrialisation accompanied by bitter squabbles. The 1820s were marked by wage cuts and personal recrimination against owners. So amid the rich commercial and cultural heritage of its recent past, Norwich suffered in the 1790s from incipient decline exacerbated by a serious trade recession.\n\nAs early in the war as 1793, a major city manufacturer and government supporter, Robert Harvey, complained of low order books, languid trade and doubling of the poor rate.{{efn |1=Quotations and facts from {{harvtxt |Wilson |2004b}}}} Like many of their Norwich forebears, the hungry poor took their complaints onto the streets. Hayes describes a meeting of 200 people in a Norwich public house, where \"Citizen Stanhope\" spoke.{{efn|1=Lord Stanhope was a radical peer, seen by many at the time as a dangerous menace. He is said to have given his rabble-rousing speech in a Norwich public house in 1794.}} The gathering \"[roared its] applause at Stanhope's declaration that the Ministers, unless they changed their policy, deserved to have their heads brought to the block; \u2013 and if there was a people still in England, the event might turn out to be so.\" Hayes says that \"the outbreak of war, in bringing the worsted manufacture almost to a standstill and so plunging the mass of the Norwich weavers into sudden distress made it almost inevitable that a crude appeal to working-class resentment should take the place of a temperate process of education which the earliest reformers had intended.\"{{sfn |Hayes |1958 |pp=242\u2013243}}\n\nAt this period opposition to Pitt's government and their war came \u2013 in their case almost unanimously \u2013 from a circle of radical Dissenting intellectuals of interest in their own right They included the Rigby, Taylor, Aitkin, Barbold, and Alderson families \u2013 all Unitarians, and some of the Quaker Gurneys, one of whose girls, Elizabeth, was under her married name of Fry to be noted campaigner for prison reform. Their activities included visits to revolutionary France (before the execution of Louis XVI), the earliest British research into German literature, studies on medical science, petitioning for parliamentary reform, and publishing a highbrow literary magazine called \"The Cabinet\", in 1795. Their blend of politics, religion and social campaigning was suspicious to Pitt and Windham, causing Pitt to denounce Norwich as \"the Jacobin city\". Edmund Burke attacked John Gurney in print for sponsoring anti-war protests. Politics aside, it is safe to say that Norwich was the most active intellectual hotbed outside London in the 1790s, and did not retrieve comparable prominence until the University of East of Anglia arrived in the late 20th century.<ref>Sources: C. B. Jewson: ''Jacobin City''; I. Scott: ''Reactions to Radicalism in Norwich 1989\u20131802''; J. P.

In April that year, the Norwich Patriotic Society was founded, its manifesto declaring \"that the great end of civil society was general happiness; that every individual had a right to share in the government.\"{{sfn |Jewson |1975 |p=66}} In December the price of bread reached a new peak, and in May 1796, when William Windham was forced to seek re-election after his appointment as war secretary, he only just held his seat.{{efn |1=Before the 20th century it was the practice for a sitting member to seek re-election if appointed to ministerial office.}} Amid the disorder and violence so often in Norwich elections, it was only by the narrowest margin that the radical Bartlett Gurney (\"Peace and Gurney \u2013 No More War \u2013 No more Barley Bread\") failed to unseat him.{{sfn |Thompson |1994}}\n\nThough informed by issues of recent national importance, the bipartisan political culture of Norwich in the 1790s cannot be divorced from local tradition. Two features stand out from a political continuum of three centuries. The first is a dichotomous power balance. From at least the time of the Reformation, Norwich was recorded as a \"two-party city\". In the mid-16th century, the weaving parishes fell under the control of opposition forces, as Kett's rebels held the north of the river, in support of poor clothworkers. Indeed there seems to be a case for saying that with this tradition of two-sided disputation, the city had steadily developed an infrastructure, evident in its many cultural and institutional networks of politics, religion, society, news media and the arts, whereby argument could be managed short of outright confrontation. Indeed at a time of hunger and tension on the Norwich streets, with alehouse crowds ready to have \"a Minister's head brought to the block\", the Anglican and Dissenting clergy exerted themselves to conduct a collegiate dialogue, seeking common ground and reinforcing the well-mannered civic tradition of earlier periods.\n\n[[File:Surrey House on Surrey Street - geograph.org.uk - 22919.jpg|thumb|left|[[Surrey House]], historic headquarters of the Norwich Union insurance company]]\nIn 1797 [[Thomas Bignold]], a 36-year-old wine merchant and banker, founded the first [[Norwich Union|Norwich Union Society]]. Some years earlier, when he moved from Kent to Norwich, Bignold had been unable to find anyone willing to insure him against the threat from highwaymen. With the entrepreneurial thought that nothing was impossible, and aware that in a city built largely of wood the threat of fire was uppermost in people's minds, Bignold formed the \"Norwich Union Society for the Insurance of Houses, Stock and Merchandise from Fire\". The new business, which became known as the Norwich Union Fire Insurance Office, was a \"mutual\" enterprise. [[Aviva|Norwich Union]] was later to become the country's largest insurance giant.\n\nFrom earliest times Norwich was a textile centre. In the 1780s the manufacture of Norwich [[shawl]]s became an important industry<ref>[http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/Research/Academic_Articles/Social_History/Norwich_Shawls/index.htm Norfolk Museums & Archaeology Service website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324192534/http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/Research/Academic_Articles/Social_History/Norwich_Shawls/index.htm |date=24 March 2012}} \u2014 \"Norwich Shawls\"</ref> and remained so for nearly a hundred years. The shawls were a high-quality fashion product and rivalled those of other towns such as [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], which had entered shawl manufacturing in about 1805, some 20 or more years after Norwich. With changes in women's fashion in the later [[Victorian period]], the popularity of shawls declined and eventually manufacture ceased. Examples of Norwich shawls are now sought after by collectors of textiles.\n\nNorwich's geographical isolation was such that until 1845, when a railway link was established, it was often quicker to travel to [[Amsterdam]] by boat than to London. The railway was introduced to Norwich by [[Samuel Morton Peto|Morton Peto]], who also built a line to [[Great Yarmouth]]. From 1808 to 1814, Norwich had a station in the [[Semaphore line|shutter telegraph chain]] that connected the [[Admiralty]] in London to its naval ships in the port of [[Great Yarmouth]]. A permanent military presence was established in the city with the completion of [[Britannia Barracks]] in 1897.<ref name=museum>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rnrm.org.uk/web_trail/web_bar_02.html |title=Britannia Barracks |publisher=Royal Norfolk Regiment Museum |accessdate=9 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109225923/http://www.rnrm.org.uk/web_trail/web_bar_02.html |archive-date=9 November 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Bethel Street drill hall, Norwich|Bethel Street]] and [[Cattle Market Street drill hall, Norwich|Cattle Market Street]] [[drill hall]]s were built around the same time.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.drillhalls.org/Counties/Norfolk/TownNorwich.htm |title=Norwich |publisher=Drill halls project |accessdate=16 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813144606/http://www.drillhalls.org/Counties/Norfolk/TownNorwich.htm |archive-date=13 August 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Waterloo Park Norwich Herbaceous Border.JPG|thumb|Waterloo Park, one of six parks built during the 1930s to help alleviate unemployment in the city]]\nIn the early 20th century, Norwich still had several major manufacturing industries. Among them were the large-scale and bespoke manufacture of shoes (for example the [[Start-rite]] and Van Dal brands, Bowhill & Elliott and Cheney & Sons Ltd respectively), clothing, joinery (including the cabinet makers and furniture retailer [[Arthur Brett and Sons]], which continues in business in the 21st century), structural engineering, and aircraft design and manufacture. Notable employers included [[Boulton & Paul]], Barnards (ironfounders and inventors of machine-produced [[wire netting]]), and the electrical engineers Laurence Scott and Electromotors.\n\nNorwich also has a long association with chocolate making, mainly through the local firm of Caley's, which began as a manufacturer and bottler of mineral water and later diversified into chocolate and [[Christmas crackers]].

Caley's was acquired by Mackintosh in the 1930s, and merged with [[Rowntree's]] in 1969 to become Rowntree-Mackintosh. Finally it was bought by [[Nestl\u00e9]] and closed in 1996, with all operations moving to [[York]] after a Norwich association of 120 years.

Significant targets hit included the Morgan's Brewery building, [[Colman's]] [[Wincarnis]] works, [[Norwich City railway station|City Station]], the Mackintosh chocolate factory, and shopping areas including St Stephen's St and St Benedict's St, the site of Bond's [[department store]] (now [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]]) and Curl's department store.\n\n229 citizens were killed in the two [[Baedeker Blitz|Baedeker raids]] with 1000 others injured, and 340 by bombing throughout the war\u2014giving Norwich the highest air raid casualties in Eastern England.

However, the ten years between 1960 and 1970 completely altered the city, and significantly large areas of Norwich were cleared to make way for modern redevelopment.\n\nIn 1960, the inner-city district of Richmond, locally known as 'the Village on the Hill' was condemned as slums, and many residents were forced to leave due to [[compulsory purchase order]]s on the old terraces and lanes. The whole borough was demolished, which consisted of around 56 acres of existing streets, including 833 dwellings (612 considered unfit for human habitation), 42 shops, four offices, 22 public houses and two schools.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/views/derek-james/returning-to-the-lost-village-on-the-hill-in-old-norwich-1-1697965 |title=Returning to the lost \"village on the hill\" in old Norwich |last=James |first=Derek |work=Norwich Evening News |access-date=2018-08-30 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180830110811/http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/views/derek-james/returning-to-the-lost-village-on-the-hill-in-old-norwich-1-1697965 |archive-date=30 August 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> Communities were moved to high-rise buildings such as Normandie Tower and new housing estates such as the Tuckswood Estate, which were being built at the time. A new road, Rouen Road was developed in the area's place, which consists mainly of light industrial units and council flats. [[Ber Street, Norwich|Ber Street]], a once historical main road into the city had its whole eastern side demolished. The final part of St Peters Street (opposite [[St Peter Mancroft]] church), along with large Georgian townhouses at the top of Bethel Street were demolished to make way for the new City Library in 1961.<ref name=\"oldcity.org.uk\"/> This burnt down in April 1994 and was replaced in 2001 with [[The Forum, Norwich|The Forum]].\n\nMany more buildings were demolished during the construction of the inner ring-road, which saw an ancient road junction \u2013 Stump Cross with Tudor and Georgian buildings in Magdalen Street, Botolph Street, St George's Street and most notably Pitt Street \u2013 cleared to make way for a fly-over and [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] concrete shopping centre, [[Anglia Square Shopping Centre, Norwich|Anglia Square]] and office blocks such as HMSO building Sovereign House. Other areas affected by the ring-road were Grapes Hill, a once narrow lane lined with 19th-century workers cottages, which was cleared and widened into a dual carriageway leading into a roundabout. Shortly before construction of this roundabout, the city's old [[Chapel Field Road drill hall, Norwich|Drill Hall]] was demolished, along with sections of the original city wall and other larger townhouses along the start of Unthank Road (named after the Unthank family, who were local landowners).<ref>{{Cite web |last1=James |first1=Derek |title=The real story behind Unthank Road |url=https://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/views/norwich-golden-triangle-unthank-derek-james-1-5352280 |website=Evening News |access-date=25 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190125184433/https://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/views/norwich-golden-triangle-unthank-derek-james-1-5352280 |archive-date=25 January 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The north-westerly corner of Chapelfield Gardens was also cut off to accommodate the new roundabout. About a mile of Georgian houses along Chapelfield Road and Queens Road; which included many houses that were built into the city walls, were bulldozed in 1964. This included the surrounding district off Vauxhall Street, consisting of swathes of terrace housing which were condemned as slums. Post-war housing and maisonettes flats now stand where the [[Rookery (slum)|Rookery slums]] once did. Some aspects of The '45 Plan were put into action, which saw large three-story Edwardian houses in Grove Avenue and Grove Road, and other large properties on Southwell Road, demolished in 1962 to make way for flat-roofed single-story style maisonettes that still stand today.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://norfolk.spydus.co.uk/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/FULL/PICNOR/BIBENQ/155332801/2219614,5?FMT=IMG|title=Spydus - Image Display \u2013 Record 5 of 8 |website=Civica |publisher=Norfolk County Council |language=en |access-date=2018-09-09}}</ref> [[Heigham (Norwich)|Heigham]] Hall, a large Victorian manor house off Old Palace Road was also demolished in 1963, to build Dolphin Grove flats.\n\nOther housing developments in the private and public sector took place after the Second World War, partly to accommodate the growing population of the city and to replace condemned and bomb-damaged areas, such as the [[Heigham (Norwich)|Heigham Grove]] district between Barn Road and Old Palace Road, and West Pottergate off Dereham Road/Earlham Road. Other central streets such as St Stephens Street was widened, firstly by [[Norwich Union]]'s new office blocks and shortly after with new buildings, after it suffered extensive damage during the [[Baedeker Blitz|Baedeker raids]]. In Surrey Street, many six-storey Georgian buildings were demolished to make way for Norwich Union's office. Other notable buildings that were lost were three theatres, the Norwich Hippodrome on St Giles Street, which is now a multi-storey car park, the Grosvenor Rooms and Electric Theatre in Prince of Wales Road, the Corn Hall in Exchange Street, the Free Library in Duke Street and the Great Eastern Hotel, which faced [[Norwich railway station|Norwich Station]]. It has been said that more of Norwich's architecture was destroyed but by the council in post-war redevelopment schemes than during the Second World War.\n\n====Other events====\nIn 1976 the city's pioneering spirit was on show when Motum Road in Norwich, allegedly the scene of \"a number of accidents over the years\", became the third road in Britain to be equipped with [[sleeping policemen]], intended to encourage adherence to the road's {{convert|30|mph|km/h}} speed limit.<ref name=Autocar197605>{{Cite journal |journal=[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] |volume=144 |issue=4147 |authorlink=Peter Garnier (Ed)|title=News: Humps \u2013 another road |page=2 |date=1 May 1976}}</ref> The bumps, installed at intervals of 50 and 150 yards, stretched 12 feet across the width of the road and their curved profile was, at its highest point, {{convert|4|inch|cm}} high.<ref name=Autocar197605/> The responsible [[Transport Research Laboratory|quango]] gave an assurance that the experimental devices would be removed not more than one year after installation.<ref name=Autocar197605/>\n\nFrom 1980 to 1985 the city became a frequent focus of national media due to squatting in [[Argyle Street, Norwich|Argyle Street]], a Victorian street that was demolished in 1986, despite being the last street to survive the Richmond Hill redevelopment.

Prince of Wales Road in the city centre, running from the Riverside district near [[Norwich railway station]] to Norwich Castle, is home to many pubs, bars and clubs.\n\n===Media and film===\n[[File:A Saturday in Norwich (14998715671) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Anglia House, the headquarters of Anglia Television, today [[ITV Anglia]]]]\nNorwich is the headquarters of BBC East, its presence in the east of England, and [[BBC Radio Norfolk]], ''[[BBC Look East]]'', ''Inside Out'' and ''[[The Politics Show]]'' are all broadcast from BBC studios in The Forum. [[Independent radio]] stations based in Norwich include [[Heart Norwich|Heart]], [[Smooth Radio]], [[99.9 Radio Norwich]], and the University of East Anglia's Livewire 1350, an online station. A community station, [[Future Radio]], was launched on 6 August 2007.\n\n[[ITV Anglia]], formerly [[Anglia Television]], is based in Norwich. Although one of the smaller ITV companies, it supplied the network with some of its most popular shows such as ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (TV series)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'', ''[[Survival (TV series)|Survival]]'' and ''[[Sale of the Century (UK game show)|Sale of the Century]]'' (1971\u20131983), which began each edition with [[John Benson (announcer)|John Benson]]'s enthusiastic announcement: \"And now from Norwich, it's the quiz of the week!\" The company also had a subsidiary called Anglia Multimedia, which produced educational content on CD and DVD mainly for schools, and was one of the three companies, along with [[Granada TV]] and the [[BBC]] vying for the right to produce a digital television station for English schools and colleges.\n\nLaunched in 1959, Anglia Television lost its independence in 1994 following a takeover by [[Meridian Broadcasting]] and subsequent mergers have seen it reduced from a significant producer of programmes to a regional news centre. The company is still based in Anglia House, the former Norfolk and Norwich Agricultural Hall, on Agricultural Hall Plain near Prince of Wales Road. However, despite the contraction of Anglia, television production in Norwich has by no means ended. Anglia's former network production centre at Magdalen Street has been taken over by Norfolk County Council and extensively re-vamped. After a total investment of \u00a34&nbsp;million from the East of England Development Agency (EEDA) it has re-opened as Epic Studios (East of England Production Innovation Centre). Degree courses in film and video are also run at the centre by Norwich University of the Arts. Epic has commercial, broadcast quality post-production facilities, a real-time virtual studio and a smaller HD discussion studio. The main studio opened as an HD facility in November 2008. Throughout 2008, the centre has concentrated on the development of new TV formats and has worked on pilot shows with Les Dennis, Gaby Roslin and Christopher Biggins.\n\n[[Archant]] publishes two daily newspapers in Norwich, the ''[[Norwich Evening News]]'', and the regional ''[[Eastern Daily Press]]'' (EDP), and had its own television operation, [[Mustard TV]], which has now closed after being bought out by the [[That's TV]] group. Mustard TV is now [[That's Norfolk]].\n\nThe character of [[Alan Partridge]] in the sitcom ''[[I'm Alan Partridge]]'' (1997\u20132002) and the comedy film ''[[Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa]]'' (2013) is a Norwich broadcaster played by [[Steve Coogan]].\n\n===Esoteric associations===\nBecause Norwich was England's second city during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, it has, though little acknowledged, a number of significant associations with [[esoteric]] spirituality. It was the home of [[William Cuningham]], a physician who published ''An Invective Epistle in Defense of Astrologers'' in 1560.<ref>Bryan's Dictionary of Painters and Engravers by Michael Bryan, edited by Robert Edmund Graves and Sir Walter Armstrong, an 1886\u20131889 publication now in the public domain</ref> The [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] dramatist [[Robert Greene (dramatist)|Robert Greene]], author of [[Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay]], was born in Norwich in 1558.

Many influential esoteric books-titles are listed as once in Browne's [[Library of Sir Thomas Browne#Esoteric|library]].<ref>Catalogue of the libraries of Sir Thomas Browne and his son Edward Browne, edited with an introduction by J.

Translated from Latin it reads, ''Great Virtues, &hellip; sleeping here the dust of his [[spagyric]] body converts the lead to gold''. Browne is also a significant figure in the history of [[physiognomy]].\n\nThe [[Church of St John Maddermarket]]'s graveyard includes the Crabtree headstone, which has the pre-Christian symbol of the [[Ouroboros]] along with [[Masonic]] [[Square and Compasses]] carved upon it.

Notable examples of [[Secularity|secular]] medieval architecture are [[Dragon Hall, Norwich|Dragon Hall]], built in about 1430, and [[Norwich Guildhall|The Guildhall]], built 1407\u20131413, with later additions. From the 18th century, the pre-eminent local name is [[Thomas Ivory]], who built the Assembly Rooms (1776), the Octagon Chapel (1756), St Helen's House (1752) in the grounds of the [[Great Hospital]], and innovative speculative housing in Surrey Street (c. 1761). Ivory should not be confused with the Irish architect of the same name and similar period.\n\nThe 19th century saw an explosion in Norwich's size and much of its housing stock, as well as commercial building in the city centre, dates from this period. The local architect of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] periods who has continued to command most critical respect was [[George Skipper]] (1856\u20131948). Examples of his work include the headquarters of [[Norwich Union]] on Surrey Street; the [[Art Nouveau]] Royal Arcade; and the Hotel de Paris in the nearby seaside town of [[Cromer]]. The [[neo-Gothic]] Roman Catholic [[St John the Baptist Cathedral, Norwich|cathedral]] dedicated to [[St John the Baptist]] on [[Earlham Road]], begun in 1882, is by [[George Gilbert Scott Junior]] and his brother, [[John Oldrid Scott]].\n\nThe city continued to grow through the 20th century, and much housing, particularly in areas further out from the city centre, dates from that century. The first notable building post-Skipper was the [[City Hall, Norwich|City Hall]] by CH James and SR Pierce, opened in 1938; at the same time, they moved the [[Norwich War Memorial|City War Memorial]], designed by [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]], to sit in a memorial garden between the city hall and the market place. Bombing during the Second World War, while resulting in relatively little loss of life, caused significant damage to the housing stock in the city centre. Much of the postwar replacement stock was designed by the local-authority architect, David Percival. However, the major postwar development in Norwich from an architectural point of view was the opening of the [[University of East Anglia]] in 1964. Originally designed by [[Denys Lasdun]] (his design was never completely executed), it has been added to over subsequent decades by major names such as [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]] and [[Rick Mather]].\n\n<gallery heights=\"132\" mode=\"packed\">\nNorwichcathedral2.jpg|Norwich Cathedral lies close to Tombland in the city centre.\nElmHill.jpg|[[Elm Hill, Norwich|Elm Hill]] is an intact medieval street.\nCowtower.jpg|[[Cow Tower, Norwich|Cow Tower]] stands on the banks of the River Wensum.\nGentlemanswalk.JPG|The varying styles of architecture along Gentleman's Walk\n</gallery>\n\n===Parks, gardens and open spaces===\n[[File:Riverside Flats Norwich - geograph.org.uk - 73621.jpg|thumb|Riverside flats Norwich]]\n''See also [[List of parks, gardens and open spaces in Norwich]]''\n\nChapelfield Gardens in central Norwich became the city's first [[public park]] in November 1880.

In the 2018\u20132019 season it finished first in the second tier of English football, the Championship, earning promotion to the Premier League for the 2019-2020 season. Majority-owned by celebrity chef [[Delia Smith]] and her husband Michael Wynn-Jones, its ground is the [[Carrow Road|Carrow Road Stadium]]. It has a strong [[East Anglian Derby|East Anglian rivalry]] with [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. The club has enjoyed considerable success in the past, having played in the top division regularly since 1972, its longest spell being a nine-year run from 1986 to 1995. It has also won two [[Football League Cup]]s and finished third in the inaugural [[Premier League]] in 1993. Norwich City FC was relegated two years later and did not reclaim its top-flight place for nine years, going down again after just one season, only to return in 2011 after two successive promotions.\n\nPerhaps Norwich City's most famous result to date came later in 1993, when it eliminated the German giants [[Bayern Munich]] from the [[UEFA Cup]], in what is to date its only season in European competitions; it had qualified for the UEFA Cup three times between 1985 and 1989 but they were unable to compete as there was a ban on English clubs in European competitions at the time. Before emerging as a top division club, it famously eliminated [[Manchester United FC|Manchester United]] from the FA Cup in 1959, and went on to reach the semi-finals of the domestic cup competition, a run it achieved again in 1989 and most recently in 1992. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the club produced some of the most highly rated talent of that era, including striker [[Chris Sutton]], winger [[Ruel Fox]], defender [[Andy Linighan]], midfielder [[Mike Phelan]], midfielder [[Tim Sherwood]] and striker [[Justin Fashanu]].

The first permanent supply started in 1893 from a generating station in Duke Street. This supplied electricity to local industry and domestic users and, from 1900, the [[Norwich Electric Tramways]]. In the late 1920s a new 40 MW power station was built at Thorpe, this was expanded in 1937 with the addition of a 30 MW \u2018high pressure\u2019 generating plant. These power stations operated until 1975.\u00a0 A gas turbine plant was installed in 1964 to provide power at times of peak demand. This closed in 1986 and the entire Thorpe power station site was demolished and cleared in 1981\u20131982. Two tall electricity pylons stood near the site until they were dismantled in 2017.

City, farewell: I mourn thy cruel fate''.\n\n[[Thomas Fuller]] in his ''The Worthies of England'' described the City in 1662 as:\n: ''Either a city in an orchard or an orchard in a city, so equally are houses and trees blended in it, so that the pleasure of the country and the populousness of the city meet here together. Yet in this mixture, the inhabitants participate nothing of the rusticalness of the one, but altogether the urbanity and civility of the other''.\n\n[[Celia Fiennes]] (1662\u20131741) visited Norwich in 1698 and described it as\n: '' a city walled full round of towers, except on the river side which serves as a wall; they seem the best in repair of any walled city I know''. She also records that three times a year the city held:\n: ''great fairs. &hellip; to which resort a vast concourse of people and wares a full trade'', Norwich being ''a rich, thriving industrious place full of weaving, knitting and dyeing''.\n\n[[Daniel Defoe]] in his ''Tour of the whole Island of Great Britain'' (1724) wrote:\n: ''the inhabitants being all busy at their manufactures, dwell in their garrets at their looms, in their combing-shops, so they call them, twisting-mills, and other work-houses; almost all the works they are employed in being done within doors''.\n\n[[John Evelyn]] (1620\u20131706), royalist, traveller and diarist, wrote to [[Sir Thomas Browne]]:\n: '' I hear Norwich is a place very much addicted to the flowery part''. He visited the City as a courtier to [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] in 1671 and described it thus:\n: ''The suburbs are large, the prospect sweet, and other amenities, not omitting the flower-garden, which all the Inhabitants excel in of this City, the fabric of stuffs, which affords the Merchants, and brings a vast trade to this populous Town''.\n[[James Woodforde]] (1740\u20131803), clergyman, on his first visit to Norwich, wrote in his Diary on 14 April 1775:\n\n: ''We took a walk over the City in the morning, and we both agreed that it was the finest City in England by far, in the center of it is a high Hill and on that a prodigious large old Castle almost perfect and forms a compleat square, round it is a fine Terrass Walk which commands the whole City. There are in the City 36 noble Churches mostly built with flint, besides many meeting Houses of divers sorts. A noble River runs almost thro the Center of the City. The City walls are also very perfect and all round the City but where the River is. On the Hills round the City stand many Wind Mills about a dozen, to be seen from Castle Mount''.\n[[George Borrow]] in his semi-autobiographical novel [[Lavengro]] (1851) wrote of Norwich as:\n: ''A fine old city, perhaps the most curious specimen at present extant of the genuine old English Town &hellip;.There it spreads from north to south, with its venerable houses, its numerous gardens, its thrice twelve churches, its mighty mound....There is an old grey castle on top of that mighty mound: and yonder rising three hundred feet above the soil, from amongst those noble forest trees, behold that old Norman master-work, that cloud-enriched cathedral spire.... Now who can wonder that the children of that fine old city are proud, and offer up prayers for her prosperity?''\n\nBorrow wrote far less favourably of the City in his translation of [[Faust]]:\n: ''They found the people of the place modelled after so unsightly a pattern, with such ugly figures and flat features that the devil owned he had never seen them equalled, except by the inhabitants of an English town, called Norwich, when dressed in their Sunday's best''.\n\nIn 1812, Andrew Robertson wrote to the painter [[Constable]]:\n: ''I arrived here a week ago and find it a place where the arts are very much cultivated &hellip; some branches of knowledge, chemistry, botany, etc. are carried to a great length.
