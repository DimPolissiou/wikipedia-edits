It is both a traditional [[home economics|domestic skill]] and, in the form of '''food logistics''', an important industrial and commercial activity. [[Food preservation]], storage, and transport, including timely delivery to consumers, are important to [[food security]], especially for the majority of people throughout the world who rely on others to produce their food. Food is stored by almost every human society and by many animals. Storing of food has several main purposes:\n\n*Storage of harvested and processed plant and animal food products for [[distribution (economics)|distribution]] to [[consumer]]s\n*Enabling a better balanced diet throughout the year\n*Reducing kitchen waste by preserving unused or uneaten food for later use\n*Preserving [[pantry]] food, such as spices or dry ingredients like rice and flour, for eventual use in cooking\n*Preparedness for catastrophes, [[emergency|emergencies]] and periods of food scarcity or famine\n*Religious reasons (Example: [[LDS Church]] leaders instruct church members to store food)<ref name=\"providentliving\">[http://providentliving.org/channel/0,11677,1706-1,00.html \"Provident Living.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029094604/http://providentliving.org/channel/0,11677,1706-1,00.html |date=2011-10-29 }}, Latter Day Saints Family Home Storage.</ref>\n*Protection from animals or theft\n\n==Domestic food storage==\n{{Further information|Food safety|Food preservation}}\n[[File:Tupperware plastic containers.jpeg|thumb|[[Tupperware]] kitchen storage containers designed for a variety of uses.]]\n[[File:Small authentic tupperware.JPG|thumb|upright|Plastic storage containers can be used to store food.]]\n\nThe safe storage of food for home use should strictly adhere to guidelines set out by reliable sources, such as the United States Department of Agriculture. These guidelines have been thoroughly researched by scientists to determine the best methods for reducing the real threat of [[Foodborne illness|food poisoning]] from unsafe food storage. It is also important to maintain proper kitchen hygiene, to reduce risks of bacteria or virus growth and food poisoning. The common food poisoning illnesses include [[Listeriosis]], [[Mycotoxicosis]], [[Salmonellosis]], [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]], [[Staphylococcal food poisoning]] and [[Botulism]]. There are many other organisms that can also cause food poisoning.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Health, Safety, and Nutrition for the Young Child|last=Marotz|first=Lynn R.|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing|year=2008|pages=[https://archive.org/details/healthsafetynutr00maro_3/page/491 491\u20132]|isbn=978-1-4283-2070-3|url=https://archive.org/details/healthsafetynutr00maro_3/page/491}}</ref>\n\nThere are also safety guidelines available for the correct methods of [[home canning]] of food. For example, there are specific boiling times that apply depending upon whether pressure canning or waterbath canning is being used in the process. These safety guidelines are intended to reduce the growth of mold and bacteria and the threat of potentially-fatal food poisoning.\n\n===Food storage safety===\n====Freezers and thawing food====\nFreezer temperature should be maintained below {{convert|0|\u00b0F}}. Food should never be thawed at room temperature, this increases the risk of bacterial and fungal growth and accordingly the risk of food poisoning.{{cn|date=August 2017}} Once thawed, food should be used and never refrozen. Frozen food should be thawed using the following methods:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Health, Safety, and Nutrition for the Young Child|last=Marotz|first=Lynn R.|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing|year=2008|pages=[https://archive.org/details/healthsafetynutr00maro_3/page/482 482]|isbn=978-1-4283-2070-3|url=https://archive.org/details/healthsafetynutr00maro_3/page/482}}</ref>\n\n* Microwave oven\n* During cooking\n* In cold water (place food in watertight, plastic bag; change water every 30 minutes)\n* In the refrigerator\n\nThrow out foods that have been warmer than {{convert|40|\u00b0F}} for more than 2 hours. If there is any doubt at all about the length of time the food has been defrosted at room temperature, it should be thrown out. Freezing does not destroy microbes present in food. Freezing at 0&nbsp;\u00b0F does inactivate microbes (bacteria, yeasts and molds). However, once food has been thawed, these microbes can again become active. Microbes in thawed food can multiply to levels that can lead to foodborne illness. Thawed food should be handled according to the same guidelines as perishable fresh food.<ref name=\"fsis.usda.gov\">{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet: Freezing and Food Safety|url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/factsheets/focus_on_freezing/index.asp|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service|accessdate=November 8, 2011|date=June 3, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112172812/http://www.fsis.usda.gov/factsheets/focus_on_freezing/index.asp|archive-date=November 12, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nFood frozen at 0&nbsp;\u00b0F and below is preserved indefinitely. However, the quality of the food will deteriorate if it is frozen over a lengthy period. The United States Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service publishes a chart showing the suggested freezer storage time for common foods.<ref name=\"fsis.usda.gov\"/>\n\n====Refrigeration====\nIt is important to note that safe food storage using refrigeration requires adhering to temperature guidelines:{{blockquote|For safety, it is important to verify the temperature of the refrigerator. Refrigerators should be set to maintain a temperature of 40 \u00b0F (4 \u00b0C) or below. Some refrigerators have built-in thermometers to measure their internal temperature. For those refrigerators without this feature, keep an appliance thermometer in the refrigerator to monitor the temperature. This can be critical in the event of a power outage. When the power goes back on, if the refrigerator is still 40 \u00b0F, the food is safe. Foods held at temperatures above 40 \u00b0F for more than 2 hours should not be consumed. Appliance thermometers are specifically designed to provide accuracy at cold temperatures. Be sure refrigerator/freezer doors are closed tightly at all times. Don\u2019t open refrigerator/freezer doors more often than necessary and close them as soon as possible.<ref name=\"Refrigeration and Food Safety\">{{Cite web|title=Refrigeration and Food Safety|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service|date=May 2010|url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/pdf/refrigeration_and_food_safety.pdf|access-date=2011-11-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130220100939/http://www.fsis.usda.gov/PDF/Refrigeration_and_Food_Safety.pdf|archive-date=2013-02-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>}}\n\n====Storage times for refrigerated food====\nThe United States Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service publishes recommended storage times for refrigerated food.<ref name=\"Refrigeration and Food Safety\"/>\n\n===Storing oils and fats===\nOils and fats can begin to go rancid quickly when not stored safely. Rancid cooking oils and fats do not often smell rancid until well after they have spoiled. Oxygen, light and heat all contribute to cooking oils becoming rancid. The higher the level of [[polyunsaturated fat]] that an oil contains, the faster it spoils. The percentage of polyunsaturated fat in some common cooking oils is: [[Safflower#Seed_oil|safflower]] (74%); [[sunflower]] (66%); corn (60%); soybean (37%); peanut (32%); [[Canola#Canola_oil|canola]] (29%); [[Olive_oil|olive]] (8%); [[coconut oil|coconut]] (5%).<ref name=\"Mitchell 2004 Ch. 15\">{{Cite book|title=Safe foods: the A-to-Z guide to the most wholesome foods for you and your family|last= Mitchell|first=Deborah|publisher=Penguin|year=2004|pages=Ch. 15|isbn=978-1-101-21015-4}}</ref>\n\nTo help preserve oils from [[rancidification]], they should be stored in a dark place, stored in oxygen-safe, light-reducing containers (e.g. dark glass or metal). Once opened, oils should be refrigerated and used within a few weeks, when some types begin to go rancid. Unopened oils can have a storage life of up to one year, but some types have a shorter shelf-life even when unopened (such as sesame and flaxseed).<ref name=\"Mitchell 2004 Ch. 15\"/>\n\n===Dry storage of foods===\n{{Further information|Food preservation}}\n\n====Vegetables====\n[[File:Mt Welby and Root Cellar Oxon Hill Manor Dec 10.JPG|thumb|A large root cellar at the [[Oxon Hill Manor]] farm in [[Maryland]]]]\nThe guidelines vary for safe storage of vegetables under dry conditions (without refrigerating or freezing). This is because different vegetables have different characteristics, for example, tomatoes contain a lot of water, while [[root vegetable]]s such as carrots and potatoes contain less. These factors, and many others, affect the amount of time that a vegetable can be kept in dry storage, as well as the temperature needed to preserve its usefulness.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vegetable harvest and storage|url=http://extension.missouri.edu/p/G6226|publisher=University of Missouri|accessdate=August 21, 2011}}</ref> The following guideline shows the required dry storage conditions:<ref>{{cite web|title=How to dry and store the vegetables you've grown|url=http://www.vegetableexpert.co.uk/how-dry-store-vegetables-grown.html|publisher=Vegetable Expert|accessdate=August 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\n* Cool and dry: [[onion]], [[List of Allium species]]\n* Cool and moist: [[root vegetable]], [[potato]], [[cabbage]]\n* Warm and dry: [[winter squash]], [[pumpkin]], [[sweet potato]]es, dried [[Chili pepper|hot peppers]]\n\nMany cultures have developed innovative ways of preserving vegetables so that they can be stored for several months between harvest seasons. Techniques include [[pickling]], [[home canning]], [[food dehydration]], or storage in a [[root cellar]].\n\n====Grain====\n[[Grain]], which includes dry kitchen ingredients such as [[flour]], [[rice]], [[millet]], [[couscous]], [[cornmeal]], and so on, can be stored in rigid sealed containers to prevent moisture contamination or insect or [[rodent]] infestation. For kitchen use, glass containers are the most traditional method. During the 20th century plastic containers were introduced for kitchen use. They are now sold in a vast variety of sizes and designs.\n\nMetal cans are used (in the [[United States]] the smallest practical grain storage uses closed-top #10 metal cans). Storage in grain sacks is ineffective; mold and pests destroy a 25&nbsp;kg cloth sack of grain in a year, even if stored off the ground in a dry area. On the ground or damp concrete, grain can spoil in as little as three days, and the grain might have to be dried before it can be [[mill (factory)|milled]]. Food stored under unsuitable conditions should not be purchased or used because of risk of spoilage. To test whether grain is still good, it can be sprouted. If it sprouts, it is still good, but if not, it should not be eaten.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/safe-food-handling/the-big-thaw-safe-defrosting-methods-for-consumers|title=The Big Thaw|website=www.fsis.usda.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-02-05}}</ref> It may take up to a week for grains to sprout. When in doubt about the safety of the food, throw it out as quickly as possible.\n\n====Spices and herbs====\nSpices and herbs are today often sold prepackaged in a way that is convenient for [[pantry]] storage. The packaging has dual purposes of both storing and dispensing the spices or herbs. They are sold in small glass or plastic containers or resealable plastic packaging. When spices or herbs are homegrown or bought in bulk, they can be stored at home in glass or plastic containers. They can be stored for extended periods, in some cases for years. However, after 6 months to a year, spices and herbs will gradually lose their flavour as oils they contain will slowly evaporate during storage.\n\nSpices and herbs can be preserved in [[vinegar]] for short periods of up to a month without losing flavor, creating a flavoured vinegar.\n\nAlternative methods for preserving herbs include freezing in water or unsalted butter. Herbs can be chopped and added to water in an ice cube tray.  After freezing, the ice cubes are emptied into a plastic freezer bag for storing in the freezer. Herbs also can be stirred into a bowl with unsalted butter, then spread on wax paper and rolled into a cylinder shape. The wax paper roll containing the butter and herbs is then stored in a freezer, and can be cut off in the desired amount for cooking. Using either of these techniques, the herbs should be used within a year.\n\n====Meat====\nUnpreserved meat has only a relatively short life in storage. [[Perishable]] meats should be [[Refrigeration|refrigerated]], [[Frozen food|frozen]], [[Drying (food)|dried]] promptly or [[Curing (food preservation)|cured]]. Storage of fresh meats is a complex discipline that affects the costs, storage life and eating quality of the meat, and the appropriate techniques vary with the kind of meat and the particular requirements.<ref>Michael Richardson, Kim Matthews, Chris Lloyd, Katie Brian. Meat quality and shelf life. Better Returns Programme [[EBLEX]] Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board. brp_b_betterreturnsfrommeatmanual-meatqualityandshelflife.pdf [http://www.eblex.org.uk]</ref> For example, [[Beef aging|dry ageing]] techniques are sometimes used to tenderize gourmet [[meat]]s by [[Meat hanging|hanging]] them in carefully controlled environments for up to 21 days, while game animals of various kinds may be hung after shooting. Details depend on personal tastes and local traditions.<ref>Editors of Creative Publishing. Dressing & Cooking Wild Game. Publisher: Creative Publishing international 1999 {{ISBN|978-0865731080}}</ref> Modern techniques of preparing meat for storage vary with the type of meat and special requirements of tenderness, flavour, hygiene, and economy.<ref>Matthews, K. R. Review of published literature and unpublished research on factors influencing beef quality. [[EBLEX]] R&D UK Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board 2011 rd_qs_b_-_meatqualityreview2010-beef.pdf from [http://www.eblex.org.uk/research/meat-quality.aspx] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324054312/http://www.eblex.org.uk/research/meat-quality.aspx |date=2013-03-24 }}</ref>\n\nSemi-dried meats like salamis and country style hams are processed first with salt, smoke, sugar, acid, or other \"cures\" then hung in cool dry storage for extended periods, sometimes exceeding a year. Some of the materials added during the [[Curing (food preservation)|curing]] of meats serve to reduce the risks of [[Foodborne illness|food poisoning]] from [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] bacteria such as species of [[Clostridium]] that release [[botulinum toxin]] that can cause [[botulism]]. Typical ingredients of curing agents that inhibit anaerobic bacteria include nitrates. Such salts are dangerously poisonous in their own right and must be added in carefully controlled quantities and according to proper techniques. Their proper use has however saved many lives and much food spoilage.\n\nLike the semi-dried meats, most salted, smoked, and simply-dried meats of different kinds that once were [[Staple food|staples]] in particular regions, now are largely luxury snacks or garnishes; examples include [[jerky]], [[biltong]], and varieties of [[pemmican]], but ham and [[bacon]] for instance, still are staples in many communities.\n\n===Food rotation===\nFood rotation is important to preserve freshness. When food is rotated, the food that has been in storage the longest is used first. As food is used, new food is added to the [[pantry]] to replace it; the essential rationale is to use the oldest food as soon as possible so that nothing is in storage too long and becomes unsafe to eat. Labelling food with paper labels on the storage container, marking the date that the container is placed in storage, can make this practice simpler. The best way to rotate food storage is to prepare [[meal]]s with stored food on a daily basis.<ref name=\"foodstoragerotation\">[https://www.familysurvivalplanning.com/food-storage-guidelines.html  Food Storage Guidelines], ''Family Survival Planning'', April 10, 2009.</ref>\n\n===For emergency preparation===\nGuides for [[Survival skills|surviving emergency conditions]] in many parts of the world recommend maintaining a store of essential foods; typically [[water]], [[cereal]]s, oil, dried [[milk]], and [[protein]] rich foods such as [[bean]]s, [[lentil]]s, [[Potted meat|tinned meat]] and fish. A food storage calculator can be used to help determine how much of these staple foods a person would need to store in order to sustain life for one full year.  In addition to storing the basic food items many people choose to supplement their food storage with frozen or preserved garden-grown fruits and vegetables and [[freeze-drying|freeze-dried]] or [[Canning|canned]] produce. An unvarying diet of [[staple food]]s prepared in the same manner can cause appetite exhaustion, leading to less caloric intake. Another benefit to having a basic supply of food storage in the home is for the potential cost savings.  Costs of dry [[bulk food]]s (before preparation) are often considerably less than convenience and fresh foods purchased at local markets or [[supermarket]]s. There is a significant market in [[convenience food]]s for campers, such as [[Drying (food)|dehydrated food]] products.\n\n==Commercial food logistics==\n[[File:Grain elevators on a farm in Israel.jpg|thumb|Silos connected to a grain elevator on a farm in [[Israel]].]]\n\nGrain and [[bean]]s are stored in tall [[grain elevator]]s, almost always at a rail head near the point of production.

Before refrigerated rail cars, meat had to be transported live, and this placed its cost so high that only farmers and the wealthy could afford it every day. In Europe much meat is transported live and slaughtered close to the point of sale. In much of Africa and Asia most meat is for local populations is raised, slaughtered and eaten locally, which is believed to be less stressful for the animals involved and minimizes meat storage needs.

It is both a traditional [[home economics|domestic skill]] and, in the form of '''food logistics''', an important industrial and commercial activity. [[Food preservation]], storage, and transport, including timely delivery to consumers, are important to [[food security]], especially for the majority of people throughout the world who rely on others to produce their food. Food is stored by almost every human society and by many animals. Storing of food has several main purposes:\n\n*Storage of harvested and processed plant and animal food products for [[distribution (economics)|distribution]] to [[consumer]]s\n*Enabling a better balanced diet throughout the year\n*Reducing kitchen waste by preserving unused or uneaten food for later use\n*Preserving [[pantry]] food, such as spices or dry ingredients like rice and flour, for eventual use in cooking\n*Preparedness for catastrophes, [[emergency|emergencies]] and periods of food scarcity or famine\n*Religious reasons (Example: [[LDS Church]] leaders instruct church members to store food)<ref name=\"providentliving\">[http://providentliving.org/channel/0,11677,1706-1,00.html \"Provident Living.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029094604/http://providentliving.org/channel/0,11677,1706-1,00.html |date=2011-10-29 }}, Latter Day Saints Family Home Storage.</ref>\n*Protection from animals or theft\n\n==Domestic food storage==\n{{Further information|Food safety|Food preservation}}\n[[File:Tupperware plastic containers.jpeg|thumb|[[Tupperware]] kitchen storage containers designed for a variety of uses.]]\n[[File:Small authentic tupperware.JPG|thumb|upright|Plastic storage containers can be used to store food.]]\n\nThe safe storage of food for home use should strictly adhere to guidelines set out by reliable sources, such as the United States Department of Agriculture. These guidelines have been thoroughly researched by scientists to determine the best methods for reducing the real threat of [[Foodborne illness|food poisoning]] from unsafe food storage. It is also important to maintain proper kitchen hygiene, to reduce risks of bacteria or virus growth and food poisoning. The common food poisoning illnesses include [[Listeriosis]], [[Mycotoxicosis]], [[Salmonellosis]], [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]], [[Staphylococcal food poisoning]] and [[Botulism]]. There are many other organisms that can also cause food poisoning.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Health, Safety, and Nutrition for the Young Child|last=Marotz|first=Lynn R.|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing|year=2008|pages=[https://archive.org/details/healthsafetynutr00maro_3/page/491 491\u20132]|isbn=978-1-4283-2070-3|url=https://archive.org/details/healthsafetynutr00maro_3/page/491}}</ref>\n\nThere are also safety guidelines available for the correct methods of [[home canning]] of food. For example, there are specific boiling times that apply depending upon whether pressure canning or waterbath canning is being used in the process. These safety guidelines are intended to reduce the growth of mold and bacteria and the threat of potentially-fatal food poisoning.\n\n===Food storage safety===\n====Freezers and thawing food====\nFreezer temperature should be maintained below {{convert|0|\u00b0F}}. Food should never be thawed at room temperature, this increases the risk of bacterial and fungal growth and accordingly the risk of food poisoning.{{cn|date=August 2017}} Once thawed, food should be used and never refrozen. Frozen food should be thawed using the following methods:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Health, Safety, and Nutrition for the Young Child|last=Marotz|first=Lynn R.|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing|year=2008|pages=[https://archive.org/details/healthsafetynutr00maro_3/page/482 482]|isbn=978-1-4283-2070-3|url=https://archive.org/details/healthsafetynutr00maro_3/page/482}}</ref>\n\n* Microwave oven\n* During cooking\n* In cold water (place food in watertight, plastic bag; change water every 30 minutes)\n* In the refrigerator\n\nThrow out foods that have been warmer than {{convert|40|\u00b0F}} for more than 2 hours. If there is any doubt at all about the length of time the food has been defrosted at room temperature, it should be thrown out. Freezing does not destroy microbes present in food. Freezing at 0&nbsp;\u00b0F does inactivate microbes (bacteria, yeasts and molds). However, once food has been thawed, these microbes can again become active. Microbes in thawed food can multiply to levels that can lead to foodborne illness. Thawed food should be handled according to the same guidelines as perishable fresh food.<ref name=\"fsis.usda.gov\">{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet: Freezing and Food Safety|url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/factsheets/focus_on_freezing/index.asp|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service|accessdate=November 8, 2011|date=June 3, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112172812/http://www.fsis.usda.gov/factsheets/focus_on_freezing/index.asp|archive-date=November 12, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nFood frozen at 0&nbsp;\u00b0F and below is preserved indefinitely. However, the quality of the food will deteriorate if it is frozen over a lengthy period. The United States Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service publishes a chart showing the suggested freezer storage time for common foods.<ref name=\"fsis.usda.gov\"/>\n\n====Refrigeration====\nIt is important to note that safe food storage using refrigeration requires adhering to temperature guidelines:{{blockquote|For safety, it is important to verify the temperature of the refrigerator. Refrigerators should be set to maintain a temperature of 40 \u00b0F (4 \u00b0C) or below. Some refrigerators have built-in thermometers to measure their internal temperature. For those refrigerators without this feature, keep an appliance thermometer in the refrigerator to monitor the temperature. This can be critical in the event of a power outage. When the power goes back on, if the refrigerator is still 40 \u00b0F, the food is safe. Foods held at temperatures above 40 \u00b0F for more than 2 hours should not be consumed. Appliance thermometers are specifically designed to provide accuracy at cold temperatures. Be sure refrigerator/freezer doors are closed tightly at all times. Don\u2019t open refrigerator/freezer doors more often than necessary and close them as soon as possible.<ref name=\"Refrigeration and Food Safety\">{{Cite web|title=Refrigeration and Food Safety|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service|date=May 2010|url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/pdf/refrigeration_and_food_safety.pdf|access-date=2011-11-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130220100939/http://www.fsis.usda.gov/PDF/Refrigeration_and_Food_Safety.pdf|archive-date=2013-02-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>}}\n\n====Storage times for refrigerated food====\nThe United States Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service publishes recommended storage times for refrigerated food.<ref name=\"Refrigeration and Food Safety\"/>\n\n===Storing oils and fats===\nOils and fats can begin to go rancid quickly when not stored safely. Rancid cooking oils and fats do not often smell rancid until well after they have spoiled. Oxygen, light and heat all contribute to cooking oils becoming rancid. The higher the level of [[polyunsaturated fat]] that an oil contains, the faster it spoils. The percentage of polyunsaturated fat in some common cooking oils is: [[Safflower#Seed_oil|safflower]] (74%); [[sunflower]] (66%); corn (60%); soybean (37%); peanut (32%); [[Canola#Canola_oil|canola]] (29%); [[Olive_oil|olive]] (8%); [[coconut oil|coconut]] (5%).<ref name=\"Mitchell 2004 Ch. 15\">{{Cite book|title=Safe foods: the A-to-Z guide to the most wholesome foods for you and your family|last= Mitchell|first=Deborah|publisher=Penguin|year=2004|pages=Ch. 15|isbn=978-1-101-21015-4}}</ref>\n\nTo help preserve oils from [[rancidification]], they should be stored in a dark place, stored in oxygen-safe, light-reducing containers (e.g. dark glass or metal). Once opened, oils should be refrigerated and used within a few weeks, when some types begin to go rancid. Unopened oils can have a storage life of up to one year, but some types have a shorter shelf-life even when unopened (such as sesame and flaxseed).<ref name=\"Mitchell 2004 Ch. 15\"/>\n\n===Dry storage of foods===\n{{Further information|Food preservation}}\n\n====Vegetables====\n[[File:Mt Welby and Root Cellar Oxon Hill Manor Dec 10.JPG|thumb|A large root cellar at the [[Oxon Hill Manor]] farm in [[Maryland]]]]\nThe guidelines vary for safe storage of vegetables under dry conditions (without refrigerating or freezing). This is because different vegetables have different characteristics, for example, tomatoes contain a lot of water, while [[root vegetable]]s such as carrots and potatoes contain less. These factors, and many others, affect the amount of time that a vegetable can be kept in dry storage, as well as the temperature needed to preserve its usefulness.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vegetable harvest and storage|url=http://extension.missouri.edu/p/G6226|publisher=University of Missouri|accessdate=August 21, 2011}}</ref> The following guideline shows the required dry storage conditions:<ref>{{cite web|title=How to dry and store the vegetables you've grown|url=http://www.vegetableexpert.co.uk/how-dry-store-vegetables-grown.html|publisher=Vegetable Expert|accessdate=August 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\n* Cool and dry: [[onion]], [[List of Allium species]]\n* Cool and moist: [[root vegetable]], [[potato]], [[cabbage]]\n* Warm and dry: [[winter squash]], [[pumpkin]], [[sweet potato]]es, dried [[Chili pepper|hot peppers]]\n\nMany cultures have developed innovative ways of preserving vegetables so that they can be stored for several months between harvest seasons. Techniques include [[pickling]], [[home canning]], [[food dehydration]], or storage in a [[root cellar]].\n\n====Grain====\n[[Grain]], which includes dry kitchen ingredients such as [[flour]], [[rice]], [[millet]], [[couscous]], [[cornmeal]], and so on, can be stored in rigid sealed containers to prevent moisture contamination or insect or [[rodent]] infestation. For kitchen use, glass containers are the most traditional method. During the 20th century plastic containers were introduced for kitchen use. They are now sold in a vast variety of sizes and designs.\n\nMetal cans are used (in the [[United States]] the smallest practical grain storage uses closed-top #10 metal cans). Storage in grain sacks is ineffective; mold and pests destroy a 25&nbsp;kg cloth sack of grain in a year, even if stored off the ground in a dry area. On the ground or damp concrete, grain can spoil in as little as three days, and the grain might have to be dried before it can be [[mill (factory)|milled]]. Food stored under unsuitable conditions should not be purchased or used because of risk of spoilage. To test whether grain is still good, it can be sprouted. If it sprouts, it is still good, but if not, it should not be eaten.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/safe-food-handling/the-big-thaw-safe-defrosting-methods-for-consumers|title=The Big Thaw|website=www.fsis.usda.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-02-05}}</ref> It may take up to a week for grains to sprout. When in doubt about the safety of the food, throw it out as quickly as possible.\n\n====Spices and herbs====\nSpices and herbs are today often sold prepackaged in a way that is convenient for [[pantry]] storage. The packaging has dual purposes of both storing and dispensing the spices or herbs. They are sold in small glass or plastic containers or resealable plastic packaging. When spices or herbs are homegrown or bought in bulk, they can be stored at home in glass or plastic containers. They can be stored for extended periods, in some cases for years. However, after 6 months to a year, spices and herbs will gradually lose their flavour as oils they contain will slowly evaporate during storage.\n\nSpices and herbs can be preserved in [[vinegar]] for short periods of up to a month without losing flavor, creating a flavoured vinegar.\n\nAlternative methods for preserving herbs include freezing in water or unsalted butter. Herbs can be chopped and added to water in an ice cube tray.  After freezing, the ice cubes are emptied into a plastic freezer bag for storing in the freezer. Herbs also can be stirred into a bowl with unsalted butter, then spread on wax paper and rolled into a cylinder shape. The wax paper roll containing the butter and herbs is then stored in a freezer, and can be cut off in the desired amount for cooking. Using either of these techniques, the herbs should be used within a year.\n\n====Meat====\nUnpreserved meat has only a relatively short life in storage. [[Perishable]] meats should be [[Refrigeration|refrigerated]], [[Frozen food|frozen]], [[Drying (food)|dried]] promptly or [[Curing (food preservation)|cured]]. Storage of fresh meats is a complex discipline that affects the costs, storage life and eating quality of the meat, and the appropriate techniques vary with the kind of meat and the particular requirements.<ref>Michael Richardson, Kim Matthews, Chris Lloyd, Katie Brian.

Some of the materials added during the [[Curing (food preservation)|curing]] of meats serve to reduce the risks of [[Foodborne illness|food poisoning]] from [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] bacteria such as species of [[Clostridium]] that release [[botulinum toxin]] that can cause [[botulism]]. Typical ingredients of curing agents that inhibit anaerobic bacteria include nitrates. Such salts are dangerously poisonous in their own right and must be added in carefully controlled quantities and according to proper techniques. Their proper use has however saved many lives and much food spoilage.\n\nLike the semi-dried meats, most salted, smoked, and simply-dried meats of different kinds that once were [[Staple food|staples]] in particular regions, now are largely luxury snacks or garnishes; examples include [[jerky]], [[biltong]], and varieties of [[pemmican]], but ham and [[bacon]] for instance, still are staples in many communities.\n\n===Food rotation===\nFood rotation is important to preserve freshness. When food is rotated, the food that has been in storage the longest is used first. As food is used, new food is added to the [[pantry]] to replace it; the essential rationale is to use the oldest food as soon as possible so that nothing is in storage too long and becomes unsafe to eat. Labelling food with paper labels on the storage container, marking the date that the container is placed in storage, can make this practice simpler.

(PNQ) was a regionally-based newspaper publishing enterprise established in Queensland, Australia on 1 April 1968, lasting for 20 years until it was taken over in 1988 by Australian Provincial Newspapers.\n\nPNQ was created through the amalgamation of six privately owned, regionally-based Queensland newspaper companies which represented multiple generations of family control since 1861. PNQ is recognised as the world's 'oldest continuously owned newspaper proprietorship, stretching over five generations.'<ref name=\"Six dynasties\"/>\n\nPrior to the formation of the PNQ conglomerate, six Queensland families: the Mannings; Irwins; Dunns; Parkinsons; Stephensons; and Kippens owned several regional newspaper empires, with their combined circulation area stretching from [[Toowoomba]] in south-east [[Queensland]] to Mackay in central Queensland, spanning the period from 1861 to 1968. The PNQ was an alliance of these established newspaper dynasties designed to expand the families' business interests, limit unhelpful competition and protect locally published newspapers from metropolitan competition and multinational take-overs. At the time of formation, the companies published six dailies and a weekly newspaper. Between 1968 and 1988 the company expanded its publishing activities to include nine daily newspapers in Queensland and four in New South Wales.<ref name=\"Six dynasties\"/>\n\nThe knock-on effect of an Australian government determination that [[News Limited]], through its purchase of the [[Herald and Weekly Times]] which in turn owned a significant proportion of PNQ shares, could not control both the major capital city newspaper, [[The Courier-Mail]], plus a majority of country newspapers, meant that PNQ was bought by the Irish media company Haswell Pty Ltd on 26 July 1988, and then onsold on 2 November 1988 to Australian Provincial News and Media Limited Corporation, a subsidiary of [[APN News & Media]] Ltd (APN).<ref name=\"Six dynasties\"/>\n\n==History and Family Involvement==\nFrom 1968 to 1988, PNQ published local, national and international news through a range of daily, weekly and periodic newspapers in regional areas of [[Queensland]] aiming to 'keep readers in touch with the world as well as the local community.'<ref>Manion, J.

The popularity of its newspapers was reflected in the loyalty of the town-based readership which appreciated the availability of local news reporting, community interest editorials and a strong personal allegiance to a home-grown enterprise.\n\n===The Dunn Family===\nThe Dunns owned or part-owned newspapers in the Queensland country towns of [[Maryborough, Queensland|Maryborough]], [[Rockhampton]], [[Toowoomba]], [[Nambour]], and [[Bundaberg]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} It was the most influential family in the PNQ conglomerate.\n\n[[Andrew Dunn (businessman)|Andrew Dunn]] (Senior) (1854-1934 [http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1194496?searchTerm=Andrew%20Dunn%20&searchLimits=l-decade=193%257C%257C%257Cl-year=1934]) was born on 24 May 1854 at Greenock, Scotland.<ref name=\"Dunn\">[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/dunn-andrew-6049 \"Kirkpatrick, R. (1981). Dunn, Andrew (1854-1934).\"]</ref> In 1879, Dunn married Kate McIntyre and the couple arrived in Queensland in 1880. They had five sons, one of whom died in infancy. The remaining four later played integral roles in the family's newspaper business. Kate Dunn died in 1889, at the age of 34.<ref name=\"Dunn\"/>\n\nOn 18 November 1891, Dunn married his second wife, Jane Cran. Together the couple had four children, two sons and two daughters. The sons of this marriage were also involved in the family newspaper trade. Dunn and his wife worked amicably as a \u2018power couple\u2019 and Jane was noted as an '... astute adviser in business affairs.'<ref name=Development>Kirkpatrick, R. (1984a). Development of A Great Newspaper Chain: The Provincial Story. Journal of the Royal Historical Society Queensland, 12(1), 83-102.</ref> Encouraged by the already well-established newspaper dynasties of the time, Dunn had his family trained in newspaper industry practices. Dunn's participation in the community extended beyond his involvement in the newspaper business, and in 1903 and 1914 Dunn served as the mayor of [[Maryborough, Queensland|Maryborough]].<ref name=\"Dunn\"/>\n\nIn 1911, using the profits generated by ''The Chronicle'', the Dunn family expanded their enterprise by acquiring the controlling interest in the ''Rockhampton Morning Bulletin''. Dunn employed his children, Andrew Dunn Jr. and Herbert Dunn, in managerial positions within his provincial publications.\n\nThe Dunn family soon realised that their provincial newspapers could not survive in a region so close to a metropolitan area, where the newspaper industry was more technologically advanced. This realisation led to their merger of ''The Warwick Argus'' with the Irwin family's ''Examiner & 'Times''.<ref name=Development/> This resulted, on 1 February 1919, in Andrew Dunn becoming the '...man who initiated the first chain of major provincial newspapers in Queensland.\u2019<ref name=Development/> These families also merged the ''Widebay and Burnett News'' and the ''Maryborough Chronicle''.\n\nAndrew Dunn's second wife, Jane Dunn, died on 14 August 1930 and he later married the head of the Queensland Country Press Association (QCPA), Ms. Marcella Heller Foote. The couple had no children. Andrew Dunn senior died on 29 April 1934.\n\n====Andrew Dunn Jr.====\n\n====William Herbert Dunn====\nWilliam Herbert Dunn (1883\u20131961) was born on 11 September 1883 in Toowoomba. Herbert Dunn was known for \u2018install[ing] dictaphones to take copy by telephone from the Country Press Association\u2019s news service in Brisbane.'<ref name=\"Dunn\"/> He was managing director of the Toowoomba enterprises from 1922 to 1951 and died on 4 April 1961.\n\n===The Irwin family===\nThe Irwin family had a long standing involvement in the [[Warwick, Queensland|Warwick]] press. Three generations of the family were active over 101 years.<ref name=\"Six dynasties\"/>\n\nSamuel John Irwin (1838-1909) was born in Newtown, Limavady, Ireland. In 1841, the Irwin family emigrated to the United States of America where Samuel Irwin lived for approximately 28 years before arriving by boat in Brisbane on 26 June 1866.<ref name=Development/> Irwin worked for ''[[The Queensland Times]]'', Ipswich, before moving to Warwick to assist in launching a rival paper called the ''Examiner & Times'' on 15 February 1867.<ref name=Development/> Irwin was a compositor during the early years of the newspaper and later formed a partnership with Richard Appleby Cowton. This partnership lasted until Cowton\u2019s death in 1891 with Cowton taking major responsibility for the paper. Irwin was a competent printer and businessman.  However, he spent the majority of his time developing his vineyards, rather than improving his journalistic skills.<ref name=Development/> After Cowton\u2019s death, Irwin appointed Harry Sterne as the editor of the ''Examiner & Times''. In 1899, Irwin bought out the Cowton family\u2019s remaining interest in the publication.\n\nOn 23 December 1878, Samuel Irwin married Matilda Jane Boyd at the Presbyterian Church in Toowoomba. They had four sons and two daughters. Three of Irwin\u2019s sons continued in the family business, Samuel Boyd (\"S.B. Irwin\") (1879\u20131933), William John Boyd (\"W.J.B.\") (1885\u20131958), and James (1887\u20131966).\n\nOn 28 July 1909, Samuel Irwin died, leaving the business to his wife and family. Matilda Irwin became the proprietor, with her eldest son, Samuel, becoming manager and Sterne remaining as the editor.<ref name=\"Six dynasties\"/> In 1919, the Irwins\u2019 merged the ''Examiner'' with the ''Argus'', which had been purchased in 1914 by the Dunns, to form the ''[[Warwick Daily News]]''. S.B. Irwin became associate editor, brother William took charge of the printing side and James ran the commercial printing section\u2019.<ref name=Development/> S.B. Irwin later became editor of the ''[[Warwick Daily News]]'' but resigned in 1926 after he was unable to get his brother's support for paying award wages as the editor. W.J.B. Irwin became the next editor of ''[[Warwick Daily News]]'', a position he held until 1945. \u2018The Irwins worked with the Dunns till 1936 when they bought back the Dunns\u2019 controlling interest for 7500 pounds.\u2019<ref name=\"Six dynasties\"/> W.J.B. Irwin then became the chairman of directors, and held the position until his death on 3 November 1958. James Irwin was then appointed chairman and held this position until his death on 20 October 1966.<ref name=Development/> James\u2019 son, Lyle, then became chairman until his death on 14 February 1972.<ref name=Development/> This was not the last family connection with the company, however, Edwin Hollingworth, husband of Mary Irwin, daughter of W.J.B. Irwin, became the company's business manager on 1 January 1946 and the managing director in 1962. Hollingworth was appointed to the PNQ board in 1962 acting on behalf of the Irwins. His son, Robert Paul, assumed managerial control in 1979.<ref name=Development/> Robert Paul was the third and final chief executive of PNQ and was the fourth generation of Irwins to be involved.<ref name=\"Six dynasties\"/>\n\n===The Manning family===\nThe Manning family was active in [[Gympie]], [[Gladstone, Queensland|Gladstone]], and [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]].\n\nWilliam Joseph \"W.J.\" Manning (1864\u20131943) was born in Eden, Twofold Bay, New South Wales. His parents relocated to Brisbane when he was three but soon moved to Gympie following the gold rush. Manning left school two months before his 14th birthday. At the behest of his parents, he reluctantly started a printing apprenticeship at the ''Gympie Times'' on 1 April 1878.<ref name=Development/> By the age of 21, Manning had completed his apprenticeship and moved to Brisbane to start work on ''Figaro'', a \u2018bright glossy weekly.\u2019<ref name=Development/> Manning married Charlotte Emma Black in 1888 and in 1889, they were expecting their first child. In the same year, Manning successfully applied for the role of manager for ''[[The Observer (Gladstone)]]''.  After only one year as manager, William Manning purchased the remaining interests from William Peel Mellefont's widow and brother to become proprietor and editor of ''[[The Observer (Gladstone)]]''. He held this role for over 20 years. W.J.'s son, Henry John (\"Jack\") Manning, was born in Gladstone on 6 August 1889. Jack's eventual involvement in the newspaper trade was to span 70 years.\n\nW.J. Manning was an influential member of the Gladstone community. He was Mayor in 1897, 1898 and 1901.<ref name=\"Six dynasties\"/> In 1910, Manning visited Mackay to purchase equipment for the [[Port Curtis Dairy Factory]], just one of the many organisations in which he held the chairman's position. During his time in Mackay, he noticed the office of the ''[[Daily Mercury]]'' and enquired whether the newspaper was for sale. Manning purchased 2200 shares from A.F. Williams, with Williams resigning on 24 April 1910. Manning took over as managing editor<ref name=Development/> selling the profitable ''[[The Observer (Gladstone)]]'' to John Henry Kessell. He moved his family to Mackay to run the struggling ''[[Daily Mercury]]''. Less than one year after his appointment as managing editor of the ''[[Daily Mercury]]'', at a salary of 400 pounds a year, Manning became managing director.<ref name=Development/> In 1917, Manning became the chairman of directors and, by 1924, the Manning family had become proprietors of the publication.<ref name=Development/>\n\nManning was devoted to the ''[[Daily Mercury]]'' and the Mackay district, investing all his savings to that end. The news columns in the ''[[Daily Mercury]]'' were known to be \u2018balanced and straightforward\u2019 as Manning would never permit news to be \u2018coloured with animosities.\u2019<ref name=\"Dunn\"/> \u2018Despite the editorial, managerial, and proprietorial demands at the ''[[Daily Mercury]]'', W.J. Manning maintained a close and active interest in numerous organisations\u2019<ref name=\"Sworn to no master\">Kirkpatrick, R. (1984b). Sworn to no master: a history of the provincial press in Queensland to 1930. Toowoomba: Darling Downs Institute Press.</ref> alongside local and state politics. In 1918, Manning unsuccessfully stood against the State Member for Mackay, [[William Forgan Smith]].\n\nThe ''[[Daily Mercury]]'' was successful under Manning's control. On 27 July 1932, shareholders agreed to privately register the company and changed its name to Mackay Printing and Publishing Company (Pty.) Ltd. It also bought 50 per cent of Radio 4MK, Mackay's first radio broadcasting service. In 1937, Manning became the director and licensee of the radio station.\n\nManning's wife, Charlotte, died on 10 October 1938 and Manning relinquished editorial control of the ''[[Daily Mercury]]'', appointing H.A. Moore as editor. Manning remained the chairman of directors and managers, and secretariat until his death on 24 April 1943.\n\n====Henry John Manning====\nHenry John \"Jack\" Manning (1889\u20131978), son of William Joseph Manning, was born on 6 August 1889. He was educated at Gladstone State School and the Normal School, Brisbane. He undertook a printer's apprenticeship before training as a cadet journalist for ''[[The Observer (Gladstone)]]''.<ref name=\"Manning\">[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/manning-henry-john-jack-11050 \"Kirkpatrick, R. (2000b). Manning, Henry John (Jack) (1889-1978).\"]</ref> After his father became principal shareholder of the ''[[Daily Mercury]]'' in 1910 he had the opportunity to work in the composing room, and as a reporter, sub-editor, gradually preparing for a managerial role.<ref name=\"Manning\"/>\n\nHe married Alison Morcom on 21 March 1916. They had two children, one of whom, Clarence Morcom \"Clarrie\" Manning (1917 \u2013 n.d.), played an integral role in the development of PNQ. Clarrie believed the success of the ''[[Daily Mercury]]'' was due to W.J. Manning's three-pronged plan to modernised the plant, invest money into the newspaper, and employ the right people.<ref name=\"Sworn to no master\"/> Clarence Manning married and had two sons and three daughters. In 1918, Jack became the business manager for the ''[[Daily Mercury]]''. He also held other notable positions. He was a board member of the QCPA, becoming chairman in 1934 and holding that position for 43 years. He became the President of the QCPA (Queensland Country Press Association) in 1928 and held this position for two years. In 1936, he became involved with the Australian Provincial Daily Press, serving over 40 years on the body's central board. Manning served on several other community organisations and, in 1953, was appointed to the [[Order of the British Empire]] (OBE). In 1956, Manning's wife died, and two years later he remarried the widow Edith Agnes Lynch n\u00e9e Clarkson . In 1958, he retired to [[Buderim]], Queensland and died 10 October 1978.\n\nManning supported the proposed merger of the Manning, Dunn and Irwin family interests in regional papers as he saw that this merger would \u2018prevent predatory metropolitan companies from buying up country newspapers one by one.\u2019<ref name=\"Manning\"/> In 1968, Provincial Newspapers (QLD) Ltd was formed.\n\n===The Parkinsons, Stephensons and Kippens===\nThree other families had notable connections to PNQ: the Stephensons, Parkinsons, and Kippens. These families controlled the [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]]-based ''[[The Queensland Times]]'' at the time of the merger which created PNQ. These families had ties to the newspaper industry lasting more than a century.\n\nIn 1861, Hugh Parkinson (1828-1909 [http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article19613335?searchTerm=hugh%20Parkinson&searchLimits=l-decade=190]) and two fellow workers employed at the ''North Australian'', Ipswich, had the opportunity to purchase a rival paper, ''The Ipswich Herald''. On 8 October 1861, they took control of the newly named ''[[The Queensland Times]]''.<ref name=\"Six dynasties\"/> Parkinson had previously been foreman printer on the ''North Australian'' but became the senior partner at ''[[The Queensland Times]]''. 'The Parkinsons maintained direct representation in the partnership from 1861 till the PNQ merger and direct employment links till 1976.'<ref name=\"Six dynasties\"/>\n\n[[Alfred John Stephenson]] (1846\u20131914) had experience as a composing room employee. However at ''[[The Queensland Times]]'' he became its managing director, a position he held for more than 45 years. Alfred Stephenson was an influential member of the [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]] community. He was the mayor of [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]] in 1907. Following in his father's footsteps, [[Alfred Tully Stephenson]] (1872\u20131938) [http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article38715096?searchTerm=Alfred%20Tully%20Stephenson&searchLimits=l-decade=193|||l-year=1938]) worked in the newspaper industry and was mayor of Ipswich in: 1912, 1914, 1921\u20131929, and 1933\u20131938.<ref name=\"Six dynasties\"/> A further two generations of Stephensons worked at ''[[The Queensland Times]]''. Their representation, which began in 1861, ended in 1975 when Gregory Stephenson resigned as editor.<ref name=\"Six dynasties\"/>\n\nThe Kippen family had commercial ties to ''[[The Queensland Times]]'' from 1862\u20131980. Their family representation ended when Norol Devon Kippen (1915\u2013n.d.) retired as deputy editor.\n\n==Success of PNQ==\nThe Dunn, Manning and Irwin family dynasties were critical to the operations of PNQ and 'worked together harmoniously and profitably for nigh on a generation'<ref name=\"Six dynasties\"/> to ensure the success of the newspaper empire.\n\nPrior to the PNQ amalgamation, Andrew Dunn - the \u2018man who initiated the first chain of provincial newspapers in Queensland\u2019<ref name=Development/> - implemented three fundamental principles to \u2018guarantee\u2019 the success of the PNQ merger. The three principles were established to \u2018ensure\u2019 protection from the expected metropolitan newspaper takeover attempts. They were:\n\n# That any organisation set up must ensure as far as possible that the present independence of the provincial press was maintained and consolidated;\n# That any organisation set up must as far as possible, consistent with other principles, preserve the status quo especially in regard to families; and\n# That any organisation set up must be such that listing of at least part of the shares on the Stock Exchange was possible in the immediate future.<ref name=Development/>\n\nBy following these principles, PNQ was successful for several years in providing an integral public service to regional Queensland by offering a free press that attempted to reflect the community conscience. The publication of community interest stories, a focus on regional policies and societal advancement within the regional publications secured a following and the close involvement of their community audiences.\n\nFinancial success followed the establishment of the PNQ enterprise moving from an 'annual net profit [of] $317,000 in 1968 to $681,000 in 1975, $1,919,000 in 1980, $4,510,000 in 1985. In 1987\u201388, its final year of operation as PNQ, the profit was $4 million.<ref name=\"Six dynasties\"/>\n\n==PNQ\u2019S Day-To-Day Operations==\nThere were three key functions involved in the day-to-day operations of the PNQ which were central to comprehending the inner workings of this organisation: news collecting and reporting, newspaper formatting and production and the physical distribution and circulation of these newspapers. Additionally, these three functions provided the context within which to consider, and the reasons behind, many family newspaper dynasties amalgamating to form Queensland's largest provincial newspaper group, PNQ, in 1968.\n\nIn the pre-digital age, collection and reporting of local area news, commercial and event-based information, together with national and international news, provided the necessary impetus for local newspaper creation in response to a strong local consumer demand. However, to enable timely and cost-effective newspaper production and distribution, each local newspaper's content, format and print run was constrained by the availability of local skilled labour and the production ability of its news presses. These matters influenced broadsheet column sizes, the amount of local news covered, heading sizes, use of tables, the spacing and layout of each newspaper, together with the number of pages in each edition.\n\nThey also impacted upon the importance of wire services as a source of news content for the newspapers. Ultimately, these factors led to provincial newspapers being local business endeavours focused on local areas and regions. It also resulted in the development of these provincial newspapers being a \u2018parasitic press\u2019<ref name=\"Sworn to no master\"/> as local newspapers would \u2018cling to\u2019 the news content provided by the more established, and broader-based, metropolitan press newspapers and \u2018district correspondents\u2019<ref name=\"Purposely Parochial\">Kirkpatrick, R. (1995). Purposely Parochial: Three Provincial Dailies, 1930-1990. Australian Studies in Journalism, 4, 79-101.</ref> as a key source for the latest information, news and gossip.<ref name=\"Sworn to no master\"/> This 'scissors-and-paste-pot journalism,'<ref name=\"Sworn to no master\"/> often occurred within PNQ's newspapers. It enabled mainstream and relatively up-to-date news to be distributed to a diverse, widespread and sparse readership in the State of Queensland.<ref name=\"Sworn to no master\"/>\n\nSimultaneously, provincial newspapers such as ''[[The Toowoomba Chronicle]]'', ''The Maryborough Chronicle'' and Rockhampton's ''[[The Morning Bulletin]]''  also reported on, and reflected, the interests and concerns of the local townspeople<ref name=\"Sworn to no master\"/> as they were, by far, the target audience for the relevant newspaper. Matters covered included important period events such as the gold rush, the [[separation of Queensland]] from New South Wales and the establishment of a separate state in the Federation, the commercial development of their particular region and the State as a whole. Strong local news content was considered essential to maintaining regional demand for these newspapers.<ref name=\"Purposely Parochial\"/> As a consequence of adopting both an immediate and far-ranging news focus, provincial newspapers became a vital factor in the development of local life and community.<ref name=\"Sworn to no master\"/> Circulation figures for these provincial newspapers attested to the success of the papers. For example, on 30 September 1970, ''The Chronicle'' sold 17,865 newspapers, ''The Maryborough Chronicle'' sold 8,143 newspapers and ''[[The Morning Bulletin]]'' sold 21,275 newspapers.<ref name=\"Purposely Parochial\"/> Between 1960 and 1990, the readership for ''The Chronicle'' increased 75.53%, ''[[The Morning Bulletin]]'' increased 32.17% and the ''Maryborough Chronicle'' increased 29.51% with the percentage home-delivered being between 45-50% for these three newspapers.<ref name=\"Purposely Parochial\"/>\n\nProvincial newspaper publishing was more than just the consideration of advertising copy flows, the layout dummy, and methods of selling advertising, newspaper distribution and deadlines. Local newspaper publishers were acutely aware that they were in the business of deriving newspaper sales revenue and advertising revenue from the local promotion of goods and services to 'target all members of the community's families.'<ref name=\"Purposely Parochial\"/> For example, ''[[The Toowoomba Chronicle]]'' had a 'Children's Page' in every Tuesday edition to cater for younger readers within their potential audience. It also provided a comprehensive review for those older readers interested in local social gatherings and events.<ref>Kirkpatrick, R. (1994a). Ghost of Caution Haunts House of Dunn: The Rise and Fall of a Queensland Newspaper Dynasty (1930-1989) (Dissertation). University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.</ref> Each newspaper publisher had to balance the cost of news reporting, together with newspaper collation, printing and distribution on the one hand, with its ability to obtain higher circulation numbers and to charge a higher price for newspaper advertising on the other. Accordingly, provincial newspaper publishing provided a broader view of the complexities of the journalistic craft beyond [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s 'who', 'what', 'why', 'when', 'where' and 'how.'<ref>White, S. A. (1996). Reporting in Australia. South Melbourne: Macmillan Education.</ref>\n\nUltimately, changes in technology, capital requirements, competition and changing consumer tastes led to a number of provincial newspapers amalgamating to form PNQ in 1968. They were then better able to compete with more nationally focused newspapers and other information media (such as television) that could be more cost effectively accessed by consumers. As a result of the provincial newspaper amalgamation, PNQ's management were more able to combat the existing and emerging competition and to profitably expand its newspaper businesses. For example, intense competition between ''[[The Toowoomba Chronicle]]'' and ''The Darling Downs Star'' between 1955 and 1970 resulted in ''The Darling Downs Star'' being eventually taken over by ''The Chronicle''.<ref name=\"Circulation\"/>\n\n== Competition ==\nOne way competing newspapers challenged other publications for readership dominance by  increasing the frequency of their publication, moving from biweekly to triweekly and perhaps to daily publishing. However, as one paper adopted this tactic, other papers had to eventually follow in order to maintain their business share. For example, from 30 June 1863, the [[Rockhampton]] ''Bulletin'', moved to publishing triweekly issues, appearing on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, to counter the emergence of ''The Argus''  which eventually followed the ''Bulletin'' from 6 February 1865, appearing on Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays.<ref name=\"Sworn to no master\"/>\n\nProfitable Queensland newspaper dynasties were able to support separate enterprises in the one region from the late nineteenth century until the First World War.  However, 'these competitors, as a rule, followed one another in price changes and in stepping up their frequency of publication through biweekly issue to daily status. Within a decade of the end of the war, many of them had either merged with their rivals or ceased publication with the realisation that advertising revenue had not expanded to keep pace with the sharp increase in production costs. Only one paper could make a comfortable living.'<ref name=\"Sworn to no master\"/>\n\n[[#Primary source|Kirkpatrick]], the major historian of the regional Queensland newspaper industry observes that 'Competition tended to survive longer in centers far removed from Brisbane.'<ref name=\"Sworn to no master\"/> This is most evident in the towns listed below:\n\n=== Maryborough (Wide Bay and Burnett) ===\nIn 1860\u201361, the Wide Bay and Burnett area quickly developed and prospered leading to the demand for provincial newspapers in the region.\n\nThe ''Maryborough Chronicle'' was first published in 1860, running triweekly until 1890 and then distributed on a daily basis. Within a year of its commencement,  ''The Chronicle'' met competition in the form of the ''Maryborough Mail'' which commenced weekly publication in 1861. Subsequently, ''The Tribune'' commenced weekly publication in  1869. Then, in 1870, ''Wide Bay and Burnett News'' commenced triweekly publication, with ''The Colonist'' starting weekly publication in 1884.\n\n=== Toowoomba ===\nIn July 1861, in opposition to Toowoomba's original newspaper, the ''Darling Downs Gazette'', a second journal, ''The Chronicle'', was published providing an opposing political voice on local affairs.\n\n=== Rockhampton ===\nIn July 1861, ''The Bulletin'' was published for the Rockhampton area and its success led to Rockhampton overtaking Maryborough as the key provincial newspaper centre. 'The Bulletin promised to present full and late details of all events of local interest, with digests of foreign news to be given on the arrival of the mails.\u2019<ref name=\"Sworn to no master\"/> There was no telegraph to Rockhampton. Correspondents had been appointed in neighboring districts and from throughout the colonies. However, by January 1863, Rockhampton had its second newspaper, the ''Daily Northern Argus'' which succeeded a short-lived comic paper, ''Punch'', which originated in July 1862.\n\nIn 1865, Rockhampton's third journal, ''The News'' was established. However, the Queensland economic depression of 1866-67 resulted in the closure of this newspaper together with other newspapers in neighbouring towns.\n\n=== Warwick ===\nThe establishment of Warwick\u2019s first newspaper, ''The Mail'', was delayed until September 1862 due to the lack of 'cohesion in the business community.'<ref name=\"Sworn to no master\"/> There was strong rivalry between competing provincial newspapers owned by the Morgan and the Irwin families who '\u2026were on opposite sides of the fence in the Warwick newspaper world and on many political issues for nearly half a century. In the manner of the times, the ''Argus'' and the ''Examiner'' sniped at one another constantly in their editorial columns.'<ref name=\"Sworn to no master\"/> This battle continued until  James Morgan bought ''The Argus'' from the Irwin family.\n\n=== Bowen ===\nAs [[Drover (Australian)|overlanders]] began to bypass Rockhampton, Bowen became a main trading centre with newspaper demand ultimately resulting in the creation of ''The Port Denison Times'' in March 1864.\n\n=== Nashville (Gympie) ===\nIn February 1868, ''The Nashville Times'' was first published as a  \u2018biweekly to serve the fortune-hunting thousands who had swarmed to the Gympie Creek gold diggings.\u2019<ref name=\"Sworn to no master\"/> As the neighbouring towns of Clermont and Nashville were developed with a mining focus, these two towns were the \u2018exception \u2026 to the rule of development inspired by pastoral expansion.\u2019<ref name=\"Sworn to no master\"/>\n\n=== Townsville (Cleveland Bay) ===\nThe continued expansion of [[Queensland]] frontiers led to the establishment of Townsville's first newspaper, ''The Cleveland Bay Express'', in 1866. Later in 1876, ''The Townsville Herald'' was introduced and ''The Northern Standard'' soon followed.\n\n=== Mackay ===\nIn April 1866, Mackay's first journal, ''The Mackay Mercury'', was established and published on a bi-weekly basis. ''The Mackay Standard'' commenced publication in 1877 on a weekly basis.\n\n=== Ipswich ===\nIn 1855, ''The North Australian'' was first published in Ipswich and appeared weekly for four years before facing competition in the area. ''The Ipswich Herald'' was introduced to Ipswich in 1859 and also ran weekly. In 1861, both newspapers merged into one, being renamed ''[[The Queensland Times]]'', which was first published on 8 October 1861.\n\n=== Gladstone ===\nIn January 1868, Gladstone produced its first newspaper, ''[[The Observer (Gladstone)]]''. It was not until 18 years later that ''[[The Observer (Gladstone)]]'' faced competition from the ''Gladstone Advocate'' in 1886. Both newspapers were published biweekly.\n\n==Demise of PNQ==\nThe geographic location of [[Queensland]] provincial newspapers, with their comparatively limited regional readership, ultimately meant that they were unable to effectively compete in the wider Australian media sphere. Swift developments in technology revolutionised newspaper production and distribution in the mid- to late-20th century led to metropolitan newspapers gaining increasingly wide circulation, thereby reducing the demand for provincial newspapers.\n\nIn his analysis of the demise of the PNQ [[#Primary source|Kirkpatrick]] discusses some of the strategies 'dying' newspapers had attempted, largely to no longer term avail, in a bid to maintain, if not to increase, their readership.  These included home delivery, community involvement and reader competitions. The overall decline in newspaper circulation can be attributed to various factors including the impact of television and online newspapers, increasing 'cover prices' and 'free newspapers.'<ref name=\"Circulation\">Kirkpatrick, R.

(PNQ) was a regionally-based newspaper publishing enterprise established in Queensland, Australia on 1 April 1968, lasting for 20 years until it was taken over in 1988 by Australian Provincial Newspapers.\n\nPNQ was created through the amalgamation of six privately owned, regionally-based Queensland newspaper companies which represented multiple generations of family control since 1861. PNQ is recognised as the world's 'oldest continuously owned newspaper proprietorship, stretching over five generations.'<ref name=\"Six dynasties\"/>\n\nPrior to the formation of the PNQ conglomerate, six Queensland families: the Mannings; Irwins; Dunns; Parkinsons; Stephensons; and Kippens owned several regional newspaper empires, with their combined circulation area stretching from [[Toowoomba]] in south-east [[Queensland]] to Mackay in central Queensland, spanning the period from 1861 to 1968. The PNQ was an alliance of these established newspaper dynasties designed to expand the families' business interests, limit unhelpful competition and protect locally published newspapers from metropolitan competition and multinational take-overs. At the time of formation, the companies published six dailies and a weekly newspaper. Between 1968 and 1988 the company expanded its publishing activities to include nine daily newspapers in Queensland and four in New South Wales.<ref name=\"Six dynasties\"/>\n\nThe knock-on effect of an Australian government determination that [[News Limited]], through its purchase of the [[Herald and Weekly Times]] which in turn owned a significant proportion of PNQ shares, could not control both the major capital city newspaper, [[The Courier-Mail]], plus a majority of country newspapers, meant that PNQ was bought by the Irish media company Haswell Pty Ltd on 26 July 1988, and then onsold on 2 November 1988 to Australian Provincial News and Media Limited Corporation, a subsidiary of [[APN News & Media]] Ltd (APN).<ref name=\"Six dynasties\"/>\n\n\u2248==History and Family Involvement==\u2248\nFrom 1968 to 1988, PNQ published local, national and international news through a range of daily, weekly and periodic newspapers in regional areas of [[Queensland]] aiming to 'keep readers in touch with the world as well as the local community.'<ref>Manion, J.

PNQ's newspapers focused on the local communities in which their newspapers were distributed. The popularity of its newspapers was reflected in the loyalty of the town-based readership which appreciated the availability of local news reporting, community interest editorials and a strong personal allegiance to a home-grown enterprise.\n\n===The Dunn Family===\nThe Dunns owned or part-owned newspapers in the Queensland country towns of [[Maryborough, Queensland|Maryborough]], [[Rockhampton]], [[Toowoomba]], [[Nambour]], and [[Bundaberg]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} It was the most influential family in the PNQ conglomerate.\n\n[[Andrew Dunn (businessman)|Andrew Dunn]] (Senior) (1854-1934 [http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1194496?searchTerm=Andrew%20Dunn%20&searchLimits=l-decade=193%257C%257C%257Cl-year=1934]) was born on 24 May 1854 at Greenock, Scotland.<ref name=\"Dunn\">[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/dunn-andrew-6049 \"Kirkpatrick, R.

The remaining four later played integral roles in the family's newspaper business. Kate Dunn died in 1889, at the age of 34.<ref name=\"Dunn\"/>\n\nOn 18 November 1891, Dunn married his second wife, Jane Cran. Together the couple had four children, two sons and two daughters. The sons of this marriage were also involved in the family newspaper trade. Dunn and his wife worked amicably as a \u2018power couple\u2019 and Jane was noted as an '... astute adviser in business affairs.'<ref name=Development>Kirkpatrick, R. (1984a). Development of A Great Newspaper Chain: The Provincial Story. Journal of the Royal Historical Society Queensland, 12(1), 83-102.</ref> Encouraged by the already well-established newspaper dynasties of the time, Dunn had his family trained in newspaper industry practices. Dunn's participation in the community extended beyond his involvement in the newspaper business, and in 1903 and 1914 Dunn served as the mayor of [[Maryborough, Queensland|Maryborough]].<ref name=\"Dunn\"/>  \n\nIn 1911, using the profits generated by ''The Chronicle'', the Dunn family expanded their enterprise by acquiring the controlling interest in the ''Rockhampton Morning Bulletin''. Dunn employed his children, Andrew Dunn Jr. and Herbert Dunn, in managerial positions within his provincial publications.\n\nThe Dunn family soon realised that their provincial newspapers could not survive in a region so close to a metropolitan area, where the newspaper industry was more technologically advanced. This realisation led to their merger of ''The Warwick Argus'' with the Irwin family's ''Examiner & 'Times''.<ref name=Development/> This resulted, on 1 February 1919, in Andrew Dunn becoming the '...man who initiated the first chain of major provincial newspapers in Queensland.\u2019<ref name=Development/> These families also merged the ''Widebay and Burnett News'' and the ''Maryborough Chronicle''.\n\nAndrew Dunn's second wife, Jane Dunn, died on 14 August 1930 and he later married the head of the Queensland Country Press Association (QCPA), Ms. Marcella Heller Foote. The couple had no children. Andrew Dunn senior died on 29 April 1934.\n\n====Andrew Dunn Jr.====\n\n====William Herbert Dunn====\nWilliam Herbert Dunn (1883\u20131961) was born on 11 September 1883 in Toowoomba. Herbert Dunn was known for \u2018install[ing] dictaphones to take copy by telephone from the Country Press Association\u2019s news service in Brisbane.'<ref name=\"Dunn\"/> He was managing director of the Toowoomba enterprises from 1922 to 1951 and died on 4 April 1961.\n\n===The Irwin family===\nThe Irwin family had a long standing involvement in the [[Warwick]] press. Three generations of the family were active over 101 years.<ref name=\"Six dynasties\"/>\n\nSamuel John Irwin (1838-1909) was born in Newtown, Limavady, Ireland. In 1841, the Irwin family emigrated to the United States of America where Samuel Irwin lived for approximately 28 years before arriving by boat in Brisbane on 26 June 1866.<ref name=Development/> Irwin worked for ''[[The Queensland Times]]'', Ipswich, before moving to Warwick to assist in launching a rival paper called the ''Examiner & Times'' on 15 February 1867.<ref name=Development/> Irwin was a compositor during the early years of the newspaper and later formed a partnership with Richard Appleby Cowton. This partnership lasted until Cowton\u2019s death in 1891 with Cowton taking major responsibility for the paper. Irwin was a competent printer and businessman.  However, he spent the majority of his time developing his vineyards, rather than improving his journalistic skills.<ref name=Development/> After Cowton\u2019s death, Irwin appointed Harry Sterne as the editor of the ''Examiner & Times''. In 1899, Irwin bought out the Cowton family\u2019s remaining interest in the publication. \n\nOn 23 December 1878, Samuel Irwin married Matilda Jane Boyd at the Presbyterian Church in Toowoomba. They had four sons and two daughters. Three of Irwin\u2019s sons continued in the family business, Samuel Boyd (\"S.B. Irwin\") (1879\u20131933), William John Boyd (\"W.J.B.\") (1885\u20131958), and James (1887\u20131966). \n\nOn 28 July 1909, Samuel Irwin died, leaving the business to his wife and family. Matilda Irwin became the proprietor, with her eldest son, Samuel, becoming manager and Sterne remaining as the editor.<ref name=\"Six dynasties\"/> In 1919, the Irwins\u2019 merged the ''Examiner'' with the ''Argus'', which had been purchased in 1914 by the Dunns, to form the ''[[Warwick Daily News]]''. S.B. Irwin became associate editor, brother William took charge of the printing side and James ran the commercial printing section\u2019.<ref name=Development/> S.B. Irwin later became editor of the ''[[Warwick Daily News]]'' but resigned in 1926 after he was unable to get his brother's support for paying award wages as the editor. W.J.B. Irwin became the next editor of ''[[Warwick Daily News]]'', a position he held until 1945. \u2018The Irwins worked with the Dunns till 1936 when they bought back the Dunns\u2019 controlling interest for 7500 pounds.\u2019<ref name=\"Six dynasties\"/> W.J.B. Irwin then became the chairman of directors, and held the position until his death on 3 November 1958. James Irwin was then appointed chairman and held this position until his death on 20 October 1966.<ref name=Development/> James\u2019 son, Lyle, then became chairman until his death on 14 February 1972.<ref name=Development/> This was not the last family connection with the company, however, Edwin Hollingworth, husband of Mary Irwin, daughter of W.J.B. Irwin, became the company's business manager on 1 January 1946 and the managing director in 1962. Hollingworth was appointed to the PNQ board in 1962 acting on behalf of the Irwins. His son, Robert Paul, assumed managerial control in 1979.<ref name=Development/> Robert Paul was the third and final chief executive of PNQ and was the fourth generation of Irwins to be involved.<ref name=\"Six dynasties\"/>\n\n===The Manning family===\nThe Manning family was active in [[Gympie]], [[Gladstone, Queensland|Gladstone]], and [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]].\n\nWilliam Joseph \"W.J.\" Manning (1864\u20131943) was born in Eden, Twofold Bay, New South Wales. His parents relocated to Brisbane when he was three but soon moved to Gympie following the gold rush. Manning left school two months before his 14th birthday. At the behest of his parents, he reluctantly started a printing apprenticeship at the ''Gympie Times'' on 1 April 1878.<ref name=Development/> By the age of 21, Manning had completed his apprenticeship and moved to Brisbane to start work on ''Figaro'', a \u2018bright glossy weekly.\u2019<ref name=Development/> Manning married Charlotte Emma Black in 1888 and in 1889, they were expecting their first child. In the same year, Manning successfully applied for the role of manager for ''[[The Observer (Gladstone)]]''.  After only one year as manager, William Manning purchased the remaining interests from William Peel Mellefont's widow and brother to become proprietor and editor of ''[[The Observer (Gladstone)]]''. He held this role for over 20 years. W.J.'s son, Henry John (\"Jack\") Manning, was born in Gladstone on 6 August 1889. Jack's eventual involvement in the newspaper trade was to span 70 years.\n\nW.J. Manning was an influential member of the Gladstone community. He was Mayor in 1897, 1898 and 1901.<ref name=\"Six dynasties\"/> In 1910, Manning visited Mackay to purchase equipment for the [[Port Curtis Dairy Factory]], just one of the many organisations in which he held the chairman's position. During his time in Mackay, he noticed the office of the ''[[Daily Mercury]]'' and enquired whether the newspaper was for sale. Manning purchased 2200 shares from A.F. Williams, with Williams resigning on 24 April 1910. Manning took over as managing editor<ref name=Development/> selling the profitable ''[[The Observer (Gladstone)]]'' to John Henry Kessell. He moved his family to Mackay to run the struggling ''[[Daily Mercury]]''. Less than one year after his appointment as managing editor of the ''[[Daily Mercury]]'', at a salary of 400 pounds a year, Manning became managing director.<ref name=Development/> In 1917, Manning became the chairman of directors and, by 1924, the Manning family had become proprietors of the publication.<ref name=Development/>\n\nManning was devoted to the ''[[Daily Mercury]]'' and the Mackay district, investing all his savings to that end. The news columns in the ''[[Daily Mercury]]'' were known to be \u2018balanced and straightforward\u2019 as Manning would never permit news to be \u2018coloured with animosities.\u2019<ref name=\"Dunn\"/> \u2018Despite the editorial, managerial, and proprietorial demands at the ''[[Daily Mercury]]'', W.J. Manning maintained a close and active interest in numerous organisations\u2019<ref name=\"Sworn to no master\">Kirkpatrick, R. (1984b). Sworn to no master: a history of the provincial press in Queensland to 1930. Toowoomba: Darling Downs Institute Press.</ref> alongside local and state politics. In 1918, Manning unsuccessfully stood against the State Member for Mackay, [[William Forgan Smith]]. \n\nThe ''[[Daily Mercury]]'' was successful under Manning's control. On 27 July 1932, shareholders agreed to privately register the company and changed its name to Mackay Printing and Publishing Company (Pty.) Ltd. It also bought 50 per cent of Radio 4MK, Mackay's first radio broadcasting service. In 1937, Manning became the director and licensee of the radio station.\n\nManning's wife, Charlotte, died on 10 October 1938 and Manning relinquished editorial control of the ''[[Daily Mercury]]'', appointing H.A. Moore as editor. Manning remained the chairman of directors and managers, and secretariat until his death on 24 April 1943.\n\n====Henry John Manning====\nHenry John \"Jack\" Manning (1889\u20131978), son of William Joseph Manning, was born on 6 August 1889. He was educated at Gladstone State School and the Normal School, Brisbane. He undertook a printer's apprenticeship before training as a cadet journalist for ''[[The Observer (Gladstone)]]''.<ref name=\"Manning\">[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/manning-henry-john-jack-11050 \"Kirkpatrick, R. (2000b). Manning, Henry John (Jack) (1889-1978).\"]</ref> After his father became principal shareholder of the ''[[Daily Mercury]]'' in 1910 he had the opportunity to work in the composing room, and as a reporter, sub-editor, gradually preparing for a managerial role.<ref name=\"Manning\"/>\n\nHe married Alison Morcom on 21 March 1916. They had two children, one of whom, Clarence Morcom \"Clarrie\" Manning (1917 \u2013 n.d.), played an integral role in the development of PNQ. Clarrie believed the success of the ''[[Daily Mercury]]'' was due to W.J. Manning's three-pronged plan to modernised the plant, invest money into the newspaper, and employ the right people.<ref name=\"Sworn to no master\"/> Clarence Manning married and had two sons and three daughters. In 1918, Jack became the business manager for the ''[[Daily Mercury]]''. He also held other notable positions. He was a board member of the QCPA, becoming chairman in 1934 and holding that position for 43 years. He became the President of the QCPA (Queensland Country Press Association) in 1928 and held this position for two years. In 1936, he became involved with the Australian Provincial Daily Press, serving over 40 years on the body's central board. Manning served on several other community organisations and, in 1953, was appointed to the [[Order of the British Empire]] (OBE). In 1956, Manning's wife died, and two years later he remarried the widow Edith Agnes Lynch n\u00e9e Clarkson . In 1958, he retired to [[Buderim]], Queensland and died 10 October 1978. \n\nManning supported the proposed merger of the Manning, Dunn and Irwin family interests in regional papers as he saw that this merger would \u2018prevent predatory metropolitan companies from buying up country newspapers one by one.\u2019<ref name=\"Manning\"/> In 1968, Provincial Newspapers (QLD) Ltd was formed.\n\n===The Parkinsons, Stephensons and Kippens===\nThree other families had notable connections to PNQ: the Stephensons, Parkinsons, and Kippens. These families controlled the [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]]-based ''[[The Queensland Times]]'' at the time of the merger which created PNQ. These families had ties to the newspaper industry lasting more than a century.\n\nIn 1861, Hugh Parkinson (1828-1909 [http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article19613335?searchTerm=hugh%20Parkinson&searchLimits=l-decade=190]) and two fellow workers employed at the ''North Australian'', Ipswich, had the opportunity to purchase a rival paper, ''The Ipswich Herald''. On 8 October 1861, they took control of the newly named ''[[The Queensland Times]]''.<ref name=\"Six dynasties\"/> Parkinson had previously been foreman printer on the ''North Australian'' but became the senior partner at ''[[The Queensland Times]]''. 'The Parkinsons maintained direct representation in the partnership from 1861 till the PNQ merger and direct employment links till 1976.'<ref name=\"Six dynasties\"/>\n\n[[Alfred John Stephenson]] (1846\u20131914) had experience as a composing room employee. However at ''[[The Queensland Times]]'' he became its managing director, a position he held for more than 45 years. Alfred Stephenson was an influential member of the [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]] community. He was the mayor of [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]] in 1907. Following in his father's footsteps, [[Alfred Tully Stephenson]] (1872\u20131938) [http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article38715096?searchTerm=Alfred%20Tully%20Stephenson&searchLimits=l-decade=193|||l-year=1938]) worked in the newspaper industry and was mayor of Ipswich in: 1912, 1914, 1921\u20131929, and 1933-1938.<ref name=\"Six dynasties\"/> A further two generations of Stephensons worked at ''[[The Queensland Times]]''. Their representation, which began in 1861, ended in 1975 when Gregory Stephenson resigned as editor.<ref name=\"Six dynasties\"/>\n\nThe Kippen family had commercial ties to ''[[The Queensland Times]]'' from 1862-1980. Their family representation ended when Norol Devon Kippen (1915\u2013n.d.) retired as deputy editor.\n\n==Success of PNQ==\nThe Dunn, Manning and Irwin family dynasties were critical to the operations of PNQ and 'worked together harmoniously and profitably for nigh on a generation'<ref name=\"Six dynasties\"/> to ensure the success of the newspaper empire. \n\nPrior to the PNQ amalgamation, Andrew Dunn - the \u2018man who initiated the first chain of provincial newspapers in Queensland\u2019<ref name=Development/> - implemented three fundamental principles to \u2018guarantee\u2019 the success of the PNQ merger. The three principles were established to \u2018ensure\u2019 protection from the expected metropolitan newspaper takeover attempts. They were:\n\n# That any organisation set up must ensure as far as possible that the present independence of the provincial press was maintained and consolidated;\n# That any organisation set up must as far as possible, consistent with other principles, preserve the status quo especially in regard to families; and\n# That any organisation set up must be such that listing of at least part of the shares on the Stock Exchange was possible in the immediate future.<ref name=Development/>\n\nBy following these principles, PNQ was successful for several years in providing an integral public service to regional Queensland by offering a free press that attempted to reflect the community conscience. The publication of community interest stories, a focus on regional policies and societal advancement within the regional publications secured a following and the close involvement of their community audiences. \n\nFinancial success followed the establishment of the PNQ enterprise moving from an 'annual net profit [of] $317,000 in 1968 to $681,000 in 1975, $1,919,000 in 1980, $4,510,000 in 1985. In 1987-88, its final year of operation as PNQ, the profit was $4 million.<ref name=\"Six dynasties\"/>\n\n==PNQ\u2019S Day-To-Day Operations==\nThere were three key functions involved in the day-to-day operations of the PNQ which were central to comprehending the inner workings of this organisation: news collecting and reporting, newspaper formatting and production and the physical distribution and circulation of these newspapers. Additionally, these three functions provided the context within which to consider, and the reasons behind, many family newspaper dynasties amalgamating to form Queensland's largest provincial newspaper group, PNQ, in 1968.\n\nIn the pre-digital age, collection and reporting of local area news, commercial and event-based information, together with national and international news, provided the necessary impetus for local newspaper creation in response to a strong local consumer demand. However, to enable timely and cost-effective newspaper production and distribution, each local newspaper's content, format and print run was constrained by the availability of local skilled labour and the production ability of its news presses. These matters influenced broadsheet column sizes, the amount of local news covered, heading sizes, use of tables, the spacing and layout of each newspaper, together with the number of pages in each edition. \n\nThey also impacted upon the importance of wire services as a source of news content for the newspapers. Ultimately, these factors led to provincial newspapers being local business endeavours focused on local areas and regions. It also resulted in the development of these provincial newspapers being a \u2018parasitic press\u2019<ref name=\"Sworn to no master\"/> as local newspapers would \u2018cling to\u2019 the news content provided by the more established, and broader-based, metropolitan press newspapers and \u2018district correspondents\u2019<ref name=\"Purposely Parochial\">Kirkpatrick, R. (1995). Purposely Parochial: Three Provincial Dailies, 1930-1990. Australian Studies in Journalism, 4, 79-101.</ref> as a key source for the latest information, news and gossip.<ref name=\"Sworn to no master\"/> This 'scissors-and-paste-pot journalism,'<ref name=\"Sworn to no master\"/> often occurred within PNQ's newspapers. It enabled mainstream and relatively up-to-date news to be distributed to a diverse, widespread and sparse readership in the State of Queensland.<ref name=\"Sworn to no master\"/>\n\nSimultaneously, provincial newspapers such as ''[[The Toowoomba Chronicle]]'', ''The Maryborough Chronicle'' and Rockhampton's ''[[The Morning Bulletin]]''  also reported on, and reflected, the interests and concerns of the local townspeople<ref name=\"Sworn to no master\"/> as they were, by far, the target audience for the relevant newspaper. Matters covered included important period events such as the gold rush, the [[separation of Queensland]] from New South Wales and the establishment of a separate state in the Federation, the commercial development of their particular region and the State as a whole. Strong local news content was considered essential to maintaining regional demand for these newspapers.<ref name=\"Purposely Parochial\"/> As a consequence of adopting both an immediate and far-ranging news focus, provincial newspapers became a vital factor in the development of local life and community.<ref name=\"Sworn to no master\"/> Circulation figures for these provincial newspapers attested to the success of the papers. For example, on 30 September 1970, ''The Chronicle'' sold 17,865 newspapers, ''The Maryborough Chronicle'' sold 8,143 newspapers and ''[[The Morning Bulletin]]'' sold 21,275 newspapers.<ref name=\"Purposely Parochial\"/> Between 1960 and 1990, the readership for ''The Chronicle'' increased 75.53%, ''[[The Morning Bulletin]]'' increased 32.17% and the ''Maryborough Chronicle'' increased 29.51% with the percentage home-delivered being between 45-50% for these three newspapers.<ref name=\"Purposely Parochial\"/>\n\nProvincial newspaper publishing was more than just the consideration of advertising copy flows, the layout dummy, and methods of selling advertising, newspaper distribution and deadlines. Local newspaper publishers were acutely aware that they were in the business of deriving newspaper sales revenue and advertising revenue from the local promotion of goods and services to 'target all members of the community's families.'<ref name=\"Purposely Parochial\"/> For example, ''[[The Toowoomba Chronicle]]'' had a 'Children's Page' in every Tuesday edition to cater for younger readers within their potential audience. It also provided a comprehensive review for those older readers interested in local social gatherings and events.<ref>Kirkpatrick, R. (1994a). Ghost of Caution Haunts House of Dunn: The Rise and Fall of a Queensland Newspaper Dynasty (1930-1989) (Dissertation). University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.</ref> Each newspaper publisher had to balance the cost of news reporting, together with newspaper collation, printing and distribution on the one hand, with its ability to obtain higher circulation numbers and to charge a higher price for newspaper advertising on the other. Accordingly, provincial newspaper publishing provided a broader view of the complexities of the journalistic craft beyond [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s 'who', 'what', 'why', 'when', 'where' and 'how.'<ref>White, S. A. (1996). Reporting in Australia. South Melbourne: Macmillan Education.</ref>\n\nUltimately, changes in technology, capital requirements, competition and changing consumer tastes led to a number of provincial newspapers amalgamating to form PNQ in 1968. They were then better able to compete with more nationally focused newspapers and other information media (such as television) that could be more cost effectively accessed by consumers. As a result of the provincial newspaper amalgamation, PNQ's management were more able to combat the existing and emerging competition and to profitably expand its newspaper businesses. For example, intense competition between ''[[The Toowoomba Chronicle]]'' and ''The Darling Downs Star'' between 1955 and 1970 resulted in ''The Darling Downs Star'' being eventually taken over by ''The Chronicle''.<ref name=\"Circulation\"/>\n\n== Competition ==\nOne way competing newspapers challenged other publications for readership dominance by  increasing the frequency of their publication, moving from biweekly to triweekly and perhaps to daily publishing. However, as one paper adopted this tactic, other papers had to eventually follow in order to maintain their business share. For example, from 30 June 1863, the [[Rockhampton]] ''Bulletin'', moved to publishing triweekly issues, appearing on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, to counter the emergence of ''The Argus''  which eventually followed the ''Bulletin'' from 6 February 1865, appearing on Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays.<ref name=\"Sworn to no master\"/>  \n\nProfitable Queensland newspaper dynasties were able to support separate enterprises in the one region from the late nineteenth century until the First World War.  However, 'these competitors, as a rule, followed one another in price changes and in stepping up their frequency of publication through biweekly issue to daily status. Within a decade of the end of the war, many of them had either merged with their rivals or ceased publication with the realisation that advertising revenue had not expanded to keep pace with the sharp increase in production costs. Only one paper could make a comfortable living.'<ref name=\"Sworn to no master\"/>\n\n[[#Primary source|Kirkpatrick]], the major historian of the regional Queensland newspaper industry observes that 'Competition tended to survive longer in centers far removed from Brisbane.'<ref name=\"Sworn to no master\"/> This is most evident in the towns listed below:\n\n=== Maryborough (Wide Bay and Burnett) ===\nIn 1860-61, the Wide Bay and Burnett area quickly developed and prospered leading to the demand for provincial newspapers in the region.  \n\nThe ''Maryborough Chronicle'' was first published in 1860, running triweekly until 1890 and then distributed on a daily basis. Within a year of its commencement,  ''The Chronicle'' met competition in the form of the ''Maryborough Mail'' which commenced weekly publication in 1861. Subsequently, ''The Tribune'' commenced weekly publication in  1869. Then, in 1870, ''Wide Bay and Burnett News'' commenced triweekly publication, with ''The Colonist'' starting weekly publication in 1884.\n\n=== Toowoomba ===\nIn July 1861, in opposition to Toowoomba's original newspaper, the ''Darling Downs Gazette'', a second journal, ''The Chronicle'', was published providing an opposing political voice on local affairs.\n\n=== Rockhampton ===\nIn July 1861, ''The Bulletin'' was published for the Rockhampton area and its success led to Rockhampton overtaking Maryborough as the key provincial newspaper centre. 'The Bulletin promised to present full and late details of all events of local interest, with digests of foreign news to be given on the arrival of the mails.\u2019<ref name=\"Sworn to no master\"/> There was no telegraph to Rockhampton. Correspondents had been appointed in neighboring districts and from throughout the colonies. However, by January 1863, Rockhampton had its second newspaper, the ''Daily Northern Argus'' which succeeded a short-lived comic paper, ''Punch'', which originated in July 1862.\n\nIn 1865, Rockhampton's third journal, ''The News'' was established. However, the Queensland economic depression of 1866-67 resulted in the closure of this newspaper together with other newspapers in neighbouring towns.\n\n=== Warwick ===\nThe establishment of Warwick\u2019s first newspaper, ''The Mail'', was delayed until September 1862 due to the lack of 'cohesion in the business community.'<ref name=\"Sworn to no master\"/> There was strong rivalry between competing provincial newspapers owned by the Morgan and the Irwin families who '\u2026were on opposite sides of the fence in the Warwick newspaper world and on many political issues for nearly half a century. In the manner of the times, the ''Argus'' and the ''Examiner'' sniped at one another constantly in their editorial columns.'<ref name=\"Sworn to no master\"/> This battle continued until  James Morgan bought ''The Argus'' from the Irwin family.\n\n=== Bowen ===\nAs [[Drover (Australian)|overlanders]] began to bypass Rockhampton, Bowen became a main trading centre with newspaper demand ultimately resulting in the creation of ''The Port Denison Times'' in March 1864.\n\n=== Nashville (Gympie) ===\nIn February 1868, ''The Nashville Times'' was first published as a  \u2018biweekly to serve the fortune-hunting thousands who had swarmed to the Gympie Creek gold diggings.\u2019<ref name=\"Sworn to no master\"/> As the neighbouring towns of Clermont and Nashville were developed with a mining focus, these two towns were the \u2018exception \u2026 to the rule of development inspired by pastoral expansion.\u2019<ref name=\"Sworn to no master\"/>\n\n=== Townsville (Cleveland Bay) ===\nThe continued expansion of [[Queensland]] frontiers led to the establishment of Townsville's first newspaper, ''The Cleveland Bay Express'', in 1866. Later in 1876, ''The Townsville Herald'' was introduced and ''The Northern Standard'' soon followed.\n\n=== Mackay ===\nIn April 1866, Mackay's first journal, ''The Mackay Mercury'', was established and published on a bi-weekly basis. ''The Mackay Standard'' commenced publication in 1877 on a weekly basis.\n\n=== Ipswich ===\nIn 1855, ''The North Australian'' was first published in Ipswich and appeared weekly for four years before facing competition in the area. ''The Ipswich Herald'' was introduced to Ipswich in 1859 and also ran weekly. In 1861, both newspapers merged into one, being renamed ''[[The Queensland Times]]'', which was first published on 8 October 1861.\n\n=== Gladstone ===\nIn January 1868, Gladstone produced its first newspaper, ''[[The Observer (Gladstone)]]''. It was not until 18 years later that ''[[The Observer (Gladstone)]]'' faced competition from the ''Gladstone Advocate'' in 1886. Both newspapers were published biweekly.\n\n==Demise of PNQ==\nThe geographic location of [[Queensland]] provincial newspapers, with their comparatively limited regional readership, ultimately meant that they were unable to effectively compete in the wider Australian media sphere. Swift developments in technology revolutionised newspaper production and distribution in the mid- to late-20th century led to metropolitan newspapers gaining increasingly wide circulation, thereby reducing the demand for provincial newspapers. \n\nIn his analysis of the demise of the PNQ [[#Primary source|Kirkpatrick]] discusses some of the strategies 'dying' newspapers had attempted, largely to no longer term avail, in a bid to maintain, if not to increase, their readership.  These included home delivery, community involvement and reader competitions. The overall decline in newspaper circulation can be attributed to various factors including the impact of television and online newspapers, increasing 'cover prices' and 'free newspapers.'<ref name=\"Circulation\">Kirkpatrick, R. (2000a). Chronic Circulation Decline: Regional Dailies Succumb to Metropolitan Virus. Australian Studies in Journalism, 75-105.</ref>\n\nOther stresses faced by PNQ included internal disagreements about strategic directions alongside nepotistic and unwise managerial appointments within PNQ which meant that later generation Dunn, Manning and Irwin families 'lack[ed] the knowledge of, and desire to indulge in, the tactics of the competitive media world.'<ref name=\"Six dynasties\"/> As [[#Primary source|Kirkpatrick]] notes, the 'financial interests of the families in the company had steadily been eroded over the years', with the fourth generation PNQ members 'lacking the degree of interest, drive and dynamism in being involved in the newspaper industry that the first, second and (some of the) third generations had exhibited.'<ref name=\"Six dynasties\"/> \n\nThe changing dynamic of the provincial newspaper publishing business on a number of levels alongside the rise of multinational corporations such as News Limited building massive business portfolios contributed to the pressures that such family owned and operated newspapers were under.\n\n==Takeover of PNQ by Australian Provincial News (APN)==\n\n{{Empty section|date=March 2013}}\n\n==Primary source==\nDr. Rod Kirkpatrick's research on the history of the Queensland provincial press is the primary reference source used in this article. As a former provincial daily newspaper editor, and now academic, Kirkpatrick has dedicated a significant part of his life to writing a history of the national provincial daily press.

In \"Daybreak\", Roslin is shown to have had two sisters, one of whom is pregnant, and a father prior to the Cylon attack on the Colonies. The morning after her sister's baby shower, two police officers inform Roslin that her family had been struck by a drunk driver and killed the previous night. Several months later, Roslin has become somewhat of a recluse and agrees to a blind date after turning down a position alongside her friend, [[List of Battlestar Galactica (reimagining) locations#Caprica City|Caprica City]] Mayor [[Richard Adar]], who is running for president. Though her blind date turns out to be a younger man who is a former student of hers, Roslin has dinner with him and sleeps with him later that night. She later calls and accepts the position with Adar, saying she will stick with it \"to the very end.\"\n\n===Cylon attack and escape===\nJust prior to the [[Cylon (2003)|Cylon]] attack on the Colonies, Roslin is the Secretary of Education under President Adar. Roslin appears to have been in a romantic relationship with Adar, which fell apart when Roslin successfully defused a large-scale teachers strike. Adar (who assumed Roslin would fail at breaking the strike through peaceful means) demands Roslin's resignation, citing the fact that he wants to use force against the teachers in order to intimidate the other unions on Caprica from striking.<ref name=\"Epiphanies\">{{cite episode| episodelink=Epiphanies (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Epiphanies| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}</ref>\n\nRoslin refuses to resign and vows to fight for her job, as she leaves for a doctor's appointment and the decommissioning ceremony for the ''Galactica.'' At her doctor's appointment, Roslin is told that she has breast cancer. Roslin attends the ''Galactica'' ceremony, and upon leaving, the Cylons attack the Twelve Colonies. During the attack, Roslin responds to \"Case Orange\", the official Colonial Government emergency automated signal, and is informed that she is the highest ranking surviving member of the Presidential line of succession. She was in fact the 43rd in line of succession, and is sworn in as President.<ref name=\"Miniseries\">{{cite episode| title=Miniseries, Parts 1 and 2| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)]]}}</ref>\n\n===Early presidency===\n{{Quote box\n | quote = \"Laura Roslin's presidency was unique in that she became president during war and cataclysm without the energy of ambition fueling her decisions.

President Roslin and [[Billy Keikeya]], her aide/press secretary/chief of staff, establish a working office space aboard her transport, renamed ''Colonial One'' (which the series' production team intentionally designed to resemble Air Force One). She immediately clashes with Commander Adama, the ranking Colonial military officer. They make an uneasy truce \u2014 that Roslin will remain President of the Colonies but that any and all military decisions will rest with Adama.<ref name=\"Miniseries\"/>\n\nFor the first few weeks, she acts as the sole voice of government, attending meetings and issuing orders alone.<ref name=\"Water\">{{cite episode| episodelink=Water (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Water| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}</ref> Soon after the conflict depicted in the episode \"[[Bastille Day (Battlestar Galactica)|Bastille Day]]\", Roslin bows to popular pressure and agrees to establish a new [[Quorum of Twelve (Battlestar Galactica)|Quorum of Twelve]].<ref name=\"Colonial Day\">{{cite episode| episodelink=Colonial Day (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Colonial Day| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}</ref>\n\nDuring the first meeting of the new Quorum, council member [[Tom Zarek]] moves to nominate a vice-president. The military and Roslin see this as a bid by Zarek (who is a convicted political terrorist) to gain the vice-presidency so that he can have Roslin assassinated and assume control over the government. In response, Roslin recruits an old political ally, Wallace Gray, to run for Vice-President, but he fares poorly against the well-connected Zarek. After he gives a stirring speech to the news media, it becomes clear that Dr. [[Gaius Baltar]] has become a popular individual in the fleet, and Roslin pressures Gray to drop out so that Baltar can enter the race. With Baltar in the race, the vote comes down to a 6-6 deadlock in the Quorum, and President Roslin breaks the tie in Baltar's favor.<ref name=\"Colonial Day\"/>\n\nBy the close of the first season, the soft-spoken Roslin has become a formidable and often ruthless leader who not only authorizes the use of torture against Cylon agents, but also orders their deaths by way of \"airlocking\" (flushing them out of an airlock into space).<ref name=\"Flesh and Bone\">{{cite episode| episodelink=Flesh and Bone (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Flesh and Bone| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}</ref>\n\n===Prophecies and arrest===\n{{Quote box\n | quote = \"Roslin is...something you rarely see on television, a consummate politician who is nevertheless treated sympathetically.

At the height of her illness, Roslin has a flashback of an encounter between Baltar and [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Six]] prior to the Cylon attack, but is not able to fully process her memories. As part of these flashbacks, it is revealed that President Adar had demanded Roslin's resignation due to a conflict between the two regarding her efforts in resolving a labor dispute, her position effectively secured by the Cylon attack and resulting governmental upheaval.<ref name=\"Epiphanies\"/>\n\nAs Roslin nears death, her life is saved by the apparent curative properties discovered in the blood of the half-human/half-Cylon fetus carried by Sharon Agathon, whose pregnancy Roslin had previously believed should be terminated.

His pride already wounded by the letter Roslin left him in the event of her death regarding his ascension to the position of \"President\", Baltar refuses. Roslin says that she will never give him another chance to do so.<ref name=\"Black Market\">{{cite episode| episodelink=Black Market (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Black Market| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}</ref>\n\nFollowing her return to duty Roslin discovered she had fallen behind in her work, and sought to again regularize internal trade within the Fleet. To these ends she sought to curtail rampant black market trading that had spread through the fleet which Lee Adama began investigating. However, he in the end reported to Roslin that their system would never be perfect, and there would always be some unavoidable black market trading in the Fleet. Lee killed the leader of the established black market network (an unscrupulous man that had the network dealing in drugs, killing with impunity, and engaged in the sexual exploitation of children, etc.), and let the survivors continue black market trading with the warning that if any of these unsavory actions were continued, he would destroy them all. Roslin was less than happy that Lee had made this decision and that trade could not be totally regulated, but begrudgingly accepted it.\n\nFurthermore, Roslin suffers more problems when her longtime aide Billy is killed during a hostage crisis regarding a group of anti-Cylon activists who seek the death of Cylon traitor Sharon Agathon. Billy is replaced by a new aide, a woman named Tory Foster. Unlike Billy, Tory is shown to be a cold-blooded realist and supports Roslin in her most controversial action in the series, when she fakes the death of Sharon and Helo's baby and orders the child be secretly adopted by a female fleet member.\n\n===Run-up to election campaign===\nWhen a young Gemenese woman stowed away to the Galactica in order to have her pregnancy terminated, President Roslin insisted that the girl was within her rights to control her own body; abortion had been legal under colonial law before the Cylon attack, and Roslin considered this law to be still in effect. Roslin commented that she had been fighting during the course of her entire political career in support of pro-choice policies; however, Admiral Adama reminded her of the day following the attacks on the Twelve Colonies, when she told him that the human race, in order to survive, would have to retreat and focus more on reproduction. She then conferred with Dr. Baltar, who confirmed that if the Fleet population continued its constant rate of decline, the human race would become extinct within 18 years. Subsequently, she reluctantly put forth an Executive Order banning the interference in any further pregnancies. The Gemenese girl's pregnancy had been terminated before the order was announced so neither she nor Dr. Cottle could be held criminally liable.<ref name=\"The Captain's Hand\">{{cite episode| episodelink=The Captain's Hand (Battlestar Galactica)| title=The Captain's Hand| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}</ref>\n\nThis decision undoubtedly weighed heavily in the upcoming elections for the new Presidency, especially since Dr. Baltar, while admitting that he had to support her decision as a member of her administration, publicly announced his private objection to the ban and announced his candidacy for president. This allowed Baltar to present himself as the \"scientific rationalist\" versus Roslin being seen as a religious as well as political leader. While the Gemenese and Sagittaron colonies are more religiously fundamental, the rest of the Twelve Colonies are shown as more secular.<ref name=\"The Captain's Hand\"/> However, this issue was not enough, and Baltar trailed Roslin heavily in all polls until a new, [[Planetary habitability|habitable planet]] was discovered. Baltar leapt on the issue, prompted by Zarek and [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Six]], to push for colonization of the planet as a [[wedge issue]] to win the election. President Roslin continued to push for the search for Earth as a final settlement. As most of the people wished for land under their feet and a roof over their heads that wasn't the deck of a starship, Baltar gained considerably in the polls.<ref name=\"Lay Down Your Burdens\">{{cite episode| episodelink=Lay Down Your Burdens (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Lay Down Your Burdens| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}</ref>\n\n===Election===\nVice-President Baltar and his political advisor Tom Zarek were able to successfully capitalize on the colonization issue, and public opinion swung in favor of settling the planet, christened New Caprica, and electing Baltar. During the night of the election, vote totals remained very close until approximately 5 hours after polls had closed, at which point Baltar was leading Roslin by roughly 5000 votes, with three ships yet to have their votes tallied. At that point, Roslin's campaign manager secretly called on Colonel Saul Tigh, who was among the military officers supervising vote-counting aboard Galactica. Tigh then signaled Petty-Officer [[Anastasia Dualla]], who left the room and commandeered an incoming ballot box, replacing it with one apparently prepared ahead of time and containing forged votes which favored President Roslin. When these votes were tallied, President Roslin was announced as having won re-election. Tom Zarek was suspicious of the results, but Baltar personally assured him that Roslin would not engage in electoral fraud.<ref name=\"Lay Down Your Burdens\"/>\n\nThe small conspiracy quickly unraveled, however, when Lieutenant Felix Gaeta noticed that the forged ballots had Vice-President Baltar's first name spelled correctly (Gaeta knew that the ship in question had a set of misprinted ballots). He brought this to the attention of Tigh, who insisted that he would handle the situation, after which Gaeta grew suspicious and personally alerted Admiral Adama. Adama, in turn, privately informed Roslin, who then herself confessed to authorizing her campaign manager's subterfuge. Adama eventually convinced Roslin that, despite the likelihood that a Baltar presidency would be \"disastrous,\" they should announce that there had been a \"tabulation error\" and allow Baltar to take office rather than betraying their principles.<ref name=\"Lay Down Your Burdens\"/>\n\n===On New Caprica===\nAfter leaving office, Roslin settled on New Caprica. She resumes her old occupation as a school teacher and aids in the care of [[Sharon Agathon]]'s half-Cylon, half-human baby, [[Hera (Cylon-Human)|Hera/Isis]].<ref name=\"Lay Down Your Burdens\"/>\n\nDuring this period, the relationship between Roslin and Adama evolves. During Adama's sole visit to the colony, Roslin shares her dream of building a cabin in the mountains of New Caprica with Adama, and the two are shown spending the night smoking a native herb, and talking about what is to become of the fleet.\n\nBut after a year on New Caprica, the Cylons discover the colony, which under Baltar's leadership immediately surrenders. While Roslin does not actively participate in the underground resistance movement, Colonel Tigh subordinates himself and his insurgent force to Roslin and Vice President [[Tom Zarek]]'s ''de facto'' government-in-waiting. Roslin and her aide, Tory Foster, make a detailed list of the colonists who collaborate with the Cylons for later use, if and when the Cylons are ever driven off the planet.\n\nWhen Tigh orders the use of [[Suicide attack|suicide bombers]], Roslin is arrested on suspicion of aiding in Tigh's decision. Roslin is freed by Baltar, who knowing that Roslin would never approve of such tactics, attempts, unsuccessfully, to get her to join him in jointly denouncing Tigh's actions. Days later, Roslin is re-arrested and nearly executed alongside a large group of suspected resistance members, but is saved by the resistance. One of the other suspected resistance members is Zarek, who used the opportunity to confirm that she tried to steal the presidential election. When she admitted she did, he told her he wished she had gone through with it.<ref name=\"Exodus\">{{cite episode| episodelink=Exodus (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Exodus| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}</ref>\n\nDuring the final battle of New Caprica, Roslin evacuates aboard ''Colonial One'', referring to it as \"my ship\" to Vice President Zarek who defers to her, tacitly acknowledging her inevitable return to office.\n\n===After New Caprica===\nAboard ''Colonial One'' Tory Foster apologetically informs Roslin that Isis/Hera and her adoptive mother cannot be accounted for and are believed to have been either killed or recaptured during the exodus from New Caprica.\n\nAfter the fleet is reunited after their escape from New Caprica, Vice President Tom Zarek ascends to the presidency in light of Baltar's abandonment of the office during the exodus. Zarek agrees that as soon as a new Quorum of Twelve is elected is found, he will name Roslin as his VP, then step down, making her again President, as he knows he could not continue as President without Adama's support. For his cooperation, Zarek asks for only a place in Roslin's new administration; but in appreciation of his refusing to cooperate with Baltar on New Caprica, Roslin says she will name him the new VP which clearly surprises Zarek.  Before Roslin can take office, however, Zarek in conjunction with [[Saul Tigh]] forms a retribution tribunal known as \"The Circle\", empowering them to investigate allegations of collaboration, and to summarily try and execute the collaborators, all in secret and without normal due process protections. When Roslin and Adama find out, they halt the Circle proceedings. Zarek justifies his actions saying that the fleet needs quick justice to prevent chaos and that Roslin's new mandate needs to start with clean hands.. After she takes office, Roslin declares a general amnesty for all Cylon collaborators and establishes a Truth and Reconciliation Committee to bring the fleet together.\n\nUpon meeting a delegation from the Cylons (Gaius Baltar, a Brother Cavil, a Number 3 and Boomer), after discovering the \"Temple of the Five\" on a newly discovered planet (nicknamed the \"Algae planet\", due to its large swathes of algae), Roslin's theft of the hybrid baby Hera is revealed.  There is a stand-off between the humans and Cylons, complicated by the planetary system's star being on the brink of going [[supernova]]. Roslin's religious insights prove useful when it comes time to determining what parts of the Temple's inscriptions relate to Earth, and perhaps what parts relate to the Cylons.  She starts to see that there may be more than a single purpose for the Temple, and that its role in Colonial religious doctrine might not be the only one \u2014 perhaps it had messages for both the Cylons and humanity.<ref name=\"TakingABreak\">{{cite episode| episodelink=Taking a Break From All Your Worries (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Taking a Break From All Your Worries| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}</ref>\n\nDuring the escape from the Algae Planet, Baltar is captured by the Colonials.<ref name=\"Rapture\">{{cite episode| episodelink=Rapture (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Rapture| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}</ref> Following his capture, Baltar is subjected to sleep-deprivation, force-feeding, and a radical form of hallucinogen-based interrogation, and then offered the possibility of escaping execution in exchange for cooperation, as Adama, Tigh and Roslin seek to learn any clues to Earth's location. When all of these stratagems fail, Baltar asks for a fair trial. Roslin rejects Adama's suggestion that Baltar be made to \"simply disappear\", and orders him to be given a fair trial for his crimes, even after a warning from Tom Zarek that doing so will provoke dangerous unrest among the fleet's civilian and military populations alike.\n\n===Returning health troubles===\nDuring Baltar's trial, it is revealed that Roslin's cancer has reappeared and that she is once again taking chamalla. Lee Adama, acting as part of Baltar's defense, argues that this makes her an illegitimate witness in Baltar's trial because of chamalla's hallucinogenic effects.<ref name=\"Crossroads Pt. 1\">{{cite episode| episodelink=Crossroads (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Crossroads| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}</ref> Baltar is acquitted, leaving Roslin with nothing but her secret illness exposed. She begins to experience shared visions (with Sharon Agathon and Number Six) which involve the human-cylon hybrid child, Hera.\n\n===Route of the gods is challenged===\nIn the opening fourth season premiere ''[[He That Believeth In Me]]'', the return of [[Kara Thrace]], presumed dead by the fleet for two months, alarms and angers Roslin, as she is convinced that Thrace's resurrection verifies her as a Cylon. Thrace's own conviction that she has visited Earth leads to conflict when Kara insists that the route given to the fleet by the Eye of Jupiter is false, and that they are pulling away from Earth's correct route, causing her great pain. Panicking, she attempts to force Roslin to turn back by infiltrating her quarters and aiming a gun at her head. She is apprehended, but not before Kara gives Roslin the chance to shoot her. Roslin fires the gun, but misses at close range. Adama later chastises Roslin, accusing her of not trusting Kara because she fears she will lose the people to a new \"visionary\" and die alone, powerless.\n\n===Deterioration, resting demons, and redemption===\nAs Roslin begins to deteriorate further, she discovers that the continued political intervention of Lee Adama (now a member of the Quorum) has placed a strain on her ability to maintain her normal routines of classified police sanctions concerning fleetwide security, as well as her relentless bias against Baltar. She briefly bonds with a cancer-ridden patient, Emily, who shares with Roslin views on death before succumbing to her illness. Roslin then resumes her duties.\n\nWhen Kara Thrace returns to the fleet in a crippled Cylon Basestar, Laura, along with Baltar, is invited aboard by a rebel Cylon crew, who are on the run and intent on finding D'anna (Number Three), who knows the identities of the [[Cylon (reimagining)#The \"Final Five\" Humanoid Cylons|Final Five]] Cylons. Roslin is taken hostage along with Baltar and several Galactica pilots when Sharon \"Athena\" Agathon guns down Natalie, a more assertive copy of Number Six and the leader of the rebel Cylons, in a misguided attempt to thwart the vision she shares with Roslin from coming to pass.\n\nAs the Cylon Basestar jumps towards the location of the Cylon Resurrection Hub, Roslin begins to experience visions of her impending death, and gradually begins to learn she has taken much in her life for granted, including the love of William Adama and his family.\n\nRoslin gives the go-ahead for a mission to destroy the Cylon hub and retrieve the resurrected D'anna, but also requests that she be given exclusive access to her, violating an agreement between the humans and Cylons to mutually question D'anna.\n\nDuring the assault on the Hub by the human and Cylon alliance, Baltar is severely injured in an explosion, and in a delirious state of self-loathing and desperation, he confesses to Roslin that he is to blame for the attacks on the Colonies. Roslin, initially angry, attempts to murder Baltar by removing his dressings and allowing him to bleed to death, but her conscience tears at her until she relents, and she chooses to spare her enemy rather than die with blood on her hands.\n\nThe Basestar returns to the fleet, where Laura reunites with Adama and finally declares her love for him, to which he replies, \"About time\".\n\n===\"Earth\"===\n\nUpon returning to the fleet with Adama, Laura does not immediately take back her role as President, instead watching Lee Adama take full control of the role and handling a hostage crisis initiated by D'anna. After the location of Earth has been verified from the co-ordinates supplied by Kara Thrace's Viper, an emotional Laura orders the fleet to jump to Earth, where the crew discover to their horror that the planet is a nuclear wasteland and virtually uninhabitable. Laura then suffers a crisis of faith due to the guilt of leading her people on a pointless journey. She burns the book of Pythia, chooses to stop taking her cancer medication, and also develops a romantic relationship with Admiral Adama.\n\nDuring [[Tom Zarek]] and [[Felix Gaeta]]'s attempted [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] and mutiny, Laura evades capture initially because the plotters are unaware that she had secretly taken up residence in Adama's quarters. She is shepherded by loyalists to an abandoned auxiliary docking port after attempting to make a broadcast denouncing the mutiny. From the docking port, she is spirited away to the rebel Cylon baseship.  The rebel Cylons remain loyal to Laura and form a de facto [[government in exile]] around her. They originally try to jump away, but after she makes a passionate speech in support of Adama, they decide to stay and a Two even helps her make a broadcast about the mutiny through Gaeta's jamming. Her heart is broken by Zarek's false report that Adama and Tigh had been killed, but her spirit is not; she vows to defeat the mutineers and commands her Cylon forces to attack ''Galactica''.  Gaeta tries to jump away instead, but Tyrol disables ''Galactica's'' FTL drive.  Faced with having to fight Roslin and lose more lives, Gaeta stands down and Adama and his loyalists retake the ship moments later.  Roslin is visibly relieved when Adama contacts her to let her know he's in command again and to stand down and Roslin (and even a Number Eight) breaks down crying and the two are joyfully reunited later.\n\nIn the wake of the failed coup, during which most members of the Quorum of the Twelve are assassinated, Roslin appoints Councilman [[Lee Adama]] as Vice President and agrees to his suggestion of a reorganized Quorum based not on the original [[Twelve Colonies]], but on representatives from each ship in the fleet, including the rebel [[Cylon (reimagining)|Cylon]] [[basestar]] whose councilman, [[Six (Battlestar Galactica)#Other versions|Sonja Six]], she warmly congratulates on her election to the new Quorum and welcomes into the government.\n\nShe also develops some form of mental link between herself, Caprica Six, Sharon \"Athena\" Agathon and the child Hera. This resulted in her collapse when during \"Someone To Watch Over Me\", when she somehow sensed  that Hera was taken by Boomer to Cavil. This link may be connected to a comment made by Ellen Tigh about something manipulating the entire events happening in the Battlestar Universe.\n\nEver since her collapse, Roslin has been in sickbay and is clearly not doing well.  She convinces Adama that he has to abandon ''Galactica'' which is now falling apart. After hearing Cottle and Ishay discussing Adama's planned rescue mission of Hera, Roslin, when alone, gets out of bed, gets dressed and makes her way to the hangar to volunteer for the rescue mission despite hardly being able to walk.  She asks Adama jokingly if he was planning on going without her and he accepts her help on the mission.  She is given injections to keep herself on her feet for two days, but is warned it will use up what little life she has left.  With both she and Vice President Adama taking part in the mission, Roslin appoints attorney and political kingmaker [[Romo Lampkin]] as a reluctant acting president; she and/or Admiral Adama similarly brevets Lieutenant [[List of minor characters in Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)#Hoshi.2C Lt. Louis|Louis Hoshi]] to the rank of Rear Admiral and commander of the fleet. During the battle, Roslin serves in sickbay and helps Hera avoid Cavil and other Centurions that have boarded ''Galactica'' as well as finally realizing the truth of her Opera House vision.\n\nAfter Hera is rescued and the Cylon colony is left to fall into a black hole, Kara Thrace inputs a set of co-ordinates into the navigational computer and the ''Galactica'' jumps far away to a habitable blue planet with a moon. The recognizable continent of Africa is seen clearly from orbit. The planet is our own Earth. Joined later by the rest of the colonial fleet, the colonials decide to settle on the new world where primitive humans already live. Roslin, while sitting with Adama, asks him what the name of the planet should be, to which he replies \"Earth\", naming it after the devastated planet they found some time ago since this new world has ended up being the sanctuary they were always looking for. Now with Roslin close to death, Adama asks Roslin if she wants to see the wildlife of the planet closer and he then takes her on a flight across the African continent in a Raptor. During the flight she utters her last words, \"So much... life,\" and dies peacefully. Heartbroken, Adama puts his wedding ring on Roslin's finger. This fulfils the [[Moses|Mosaic]] prophecy that the anointed leader will \"guide the caravan of the heavens to their new homeland\" but the leader will not live to enter the new land.  Adama buries her on the hilltop where he intends to build their cabin and visits her grave often. Lampkin is last seen exercising leadership among the settlers.\n\n==Development==\nUnlike most of the other central human characters at start of the series, Roslin has no direct analogue in the original 1978 program, though a character named Siress Tinia (played by [[Ina Balin]]) featured in the original series episode \"[[Baltar's Escape]]\". In that episode, Tinia is a member of the Quorum of Twelve, assigned to shadow Adama as an \"advisor\" and the Quorum's official representative. She sometimes comes into conflict with Adama and challenges his decisions, much like Laura Roslin does with Commander William Adama, though the two eventually grow to respect each other.\n\nWhile it may be a coincidence, her name is an amalgam of the forenames of the [[First Lady of the United States|U.S. First Ladies]] in 2003 and 1978: [[Laura Bush]] and [[Rosalynn Carter]]. According to McDonnell, influences for the character included [[Madeleine Albright]] and [[Hillary Clinton]].<ref>[https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/battlestar-galacticast-mary-mcdonnell-at-eccc-2019 Battlestar Galacticast: Mary McDonnell at ECCC 2019]</ref>\n\nExecutive producer [[Ronald D.

In \"Daybreak\", Roslin is shown to have had two sisters, one of whom is pregnant, and a father prior to the Cylon attack on the Colonies. The morning after her sister's baby shower, two police officers inform Roslin that her family had been struck by a drunk driver and killed the previous night. Several months later, Roslin has become somewhat of a recluse and agrees to a blind date after turning down a position alongside her friend, [[List of Battlestar Galactica (reimagining) locations#Caprica City|Caprica City]] Mayor [[Richard Adar]], who is running for President. Though her blind date turns out to be a younger man who is a former student of hers, Roslin has dinner with him and sleeps with him later that night. She later calls and accepts the position with Adar, saying she will stick with it \"to the very end.\"\n\n===Cylon attack and escape===\nJust prior to the [[Cylon (2003)|Cylon]] attack on the Colonies, Roslin is the Secretary of Education under President Adar. Roslin appears to have been in a romantic relationship with Adar, which fell apart when Roslin successfully defused a large-scale teachers strike. Adar (who assumed Roslin would fail at breaking the strike through peaceful means) demands Roslin's resignation, citing the fact that he wants to use force against the teachers in order to intimidate the other unions on Caprica from striking.<ref name=\"Epiphanies\">{{cite episode| episodelink=Epiphanies (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Epiphanies| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}</ref>\n\nRoslin refuses to resign and vows to fight for her job, as she leaves for a doctor's appointment and the decommissioning ceremony for the ''Galactica.'' At her doctor's appointment, Roslin is told that she has breast cancer. Roslin attends the ''Galactica'' ceremony, and upon leaving, the Cylons attack the Twelve Colonies. During the attack, Roslin responds to \"Case Orange\", the official Colonial Government emergency automated signal, and is informed that she is the highest ranking surviving member of the Presidential line of succession.

She immediately clashes with Commander Adama, the ranking Colonial military officer. They make an uneasy truce \u2014 that Roslin will remain President of the Colonies but that any and all military decisions will rest with Adama.<ref name=\"Miniseries\"/>\n\nFor the first few weeks, she acts as the sole voice of government, attending meetings and issuing orders alone.<ref name=\"Water\">{{cite episode| episodelink=Water (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Water| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}</ref> Soon after the conflict depicted in the episode \"[[Bastille Day (Battlestar Galactica)|Bastille Day]]\", Roslin bows to popular pressure and agrees to establish a new [[Quorum of Twelve (Battlestar Galactica)|Quorum of Twelve]].<ref name=\"Colonial Day\">{{cite episode| episodelink=Colonial Day (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Colonial Day| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}</ref>\n\nDuring the first meeting of the new Quorum, council member [[Tom Zarek]] moves to nominate a vice-president. The military and Roslin see this as a bid by Zarek (who is a convicted political terrorist) to gain the vice-presidency so that he can have Roslin assassinated and assume control over the government. In response, Roslin recruits an old political ally, Wallace Gray, to run for Vice-President, but he fares poorly against the well-connected Zarek. After he gives a stirring speech to the news media, it becomes clear that Dr. [[Gaius Baltar]] has become a popular individual in the fleet, and Roslin pressures Gray to drop out so that Baltar can enter the race. With Baltar in the race, the vote comes down to a 6-6 deadlock in the Quorum, and President Roslin breaks the tie in Baltar's favor.<ref name=\"Colonial Day\"/>\n\nBy the close of the first season, the soft-spoken Roslin has become a formidable and often ruthless leader who not only authorizes the use of torture against Cylon agents, but also orders their deaths by way of \"airlocking\" (flushing them out of an airlock into space).<ref name=\"Flesh and Bone\">{{cite episode| episodelink=Flesh and Bone (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Flesh and Bone| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}</ref>\n\n===Prophecies and arrest===\n{{Quote box\n | quote = \"Roslin is...something you rarely see on television, a consummate politician who is nevertheless treated sympathetically.

As a result of this action, Commander Adama has her removed from power and thrown in the [[jail|brig]] for breaking their agreement and interfering in military matters.<ref name=\"Kobol's Last Gleaming\"/>\n\nDuring her imprisonment, Adama is shot, and Tigh takes charge of the fleet.

Though neither is ultimately willing to follow through, Cain is still killed by a Cylon she had imprisoned and tortured, and Roslin promotes Adama to Admiral.<ref name=\"Resurrection Ship\">{{cite episode| episodelink=Resurrection Ship (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Resurrection Ship| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}</ref>\n\nWeeks after the ''Pegasus'' joins the fleet, Roslin is admitted to the ''Galactica''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s sickbay, on the verge of death. At the height of her illness, Roslin has a flashback of an encounter between Baltar and [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Six]] prior to the Cylon attack, but is not able to fully process her memories. As part of these flashbacks, it is revealed that President Adar had demanded Roslin's resignation due to a conflict between the two regarding her efforts in resolving a labor dispute, her position effectively secured by the Cylon attack and resulting governmental upheaval.<ref name=\"Epiphanies\"/>\n\nAs Roslin nears death, her life is saved by the apparent curative properties discovered in the blood of the half-human/half-Cylon fetus carried by Sharon Agathon, whose pregnancy Roslin had previously believed should be terminated. Ostensibly cured of her cancer, she returns to her duties.<ref name=\"Epiphanies\"/>\n\n===Administration strains===\nAfter recovering and processing her memories of Baltar and Six, Roslin asks Baltar to resign his post as Vice President. His pride already wounded by the letter Roslin left him in the event of her death regarding his ascension to the position of \"President\", Baltar refuses. Roslin says that she will never give him another chance to do so.<ref name=\"Black Market\">{{cite episode| episodelink=Black Market (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Black Market| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}</ref>\n\nFollowing her return to duty Roslin discovered she had fallen behind in her work, and sought to again regularize internal trade within the Fleet. To these ends she sought to curtail rampant black market trading that had spread through the fleet which Lee Adama began investigating. However, he in the end reported to Roslin that their system would never be perfect, and there would always be some unavoidable black market trading in the Fleet. Lee killed the leader of the established black market network (an unscrupulous man that had the network dealing in drugs, killing with impunity, and engaged in the sexual exploitation of children, etc.), and let the survivors continue black market trading with the warning that if any of these unsavory actions were continued, he would destroy them all. Roslin was less than happy that Lee had made this decision and that trade could not be totally regulated, but begrudgingly accepted it.\n\nFurthermore, Roslin suffers more problems when her longtime aide Billy is killed during a hostage crisis regarding a group of anti-Cylon activists who seek the death of Cylon traitor Sharon Agathon. Billy is replaced by a new aide, a woman named Tory Foster. Unlike Billy, Tory is shown to be a cold-blooded realist and supports Roslin in her most controversial action in the series, when she fakes the death of Sharon and Helo's baby and orders the child be secretly adopted by a female fleet member.\n\n===Run-up to election campaign===\nWhen a young Gemenese woman stowed away to the Galactica in order to have her pregnancy terminated, President Roslin insisted that the girl was within her rights to control her own body; abortion had been legal under colonial law before the Cylon attack, and Roslin considered this law to be still in effect. Roslin commented that she had been fighting during the course of her entire political career in support of pro-choice policies; however, Admiral Adama reminded her of the day following the attacks on the Twelve Colonies, when she told him that the human race, in order to survive, would have to retreat and focus more on reproduction. She then conferred with Dr. Baltar, who confirmed that if the Fleet population continued its constant rate of decline, the human race would become extinct within 18 years. Subsequently, she reluctantly put forth an Executive Order banning the interference in any further pregnancies. The Gemenese girl's pregnancy had been terminated before the order was announced so neither she nor Dr. Cottle could be held criminally liable.<ref name=\"The Captain's Hand\">{{cite episode| episodelink=The Captain's Hand (Battlestar Galactica)| title=The Captain's Hand| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}</ref>\n\nThis decision undoubtedly weighed heavily in the upcoming elections for the new Presidency, especially since Dr. Baltar, while admitting that he had to support her decision as a member of her administration, publicly announced his private objection to the ban and announced his candidacy for President. This allowed Baltar to present himself as the \"scientific rationalist\" versus Roslin being seen as a religious as well as political leader. While the Gemenese and Sagittaron colonies are more religiously fundamental, the rest of the Twelve Colonies are shown as more secular.<ref name=\"The Captain's Hand\"/> However, this issue was not enough, and Baltar trailed Roslin heavily in all polls until a new, [[Planetary habitability|habitable planet]] was discovered. Baltar leapt on the issue, prompted by Zarek and [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Six]], to push for colonization of the planet as a [[wedge issue]] to win the election. President Roslin continued to push for the search for Earth as a final settlement. As most of the people wished for land under their feet and a roof over their heads that wasn't the deck of a starship, Baltar gained considerably in the polls.<ref name=\"Lay Down Your Burdens\">{{cite episode| episodelink=Lay Down Your Burdens (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Lay Down Your Burdens| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}</ref>\n\n===Election===\nVice-President Baltar and his political advisor Tom Zarek were able to successfully capitalize on the colonization issue, and public opinion swung in favor of settling the planet, christened New Caprica, and electing Baltar. During the night of the election, vote totals remained very close until approximately 5 hours after polls had closed, at which point Baltar was leading Roslin by roughly 5000 votes, with three ships yet to have their votes tallied. At that point, Roslin's campaign manager secretly called on Colonel Saul Tigh, who was among the military officers supervising vote-counting aboard Galactica. Tigh then signaled Petty-Officer [[Anastasia Dualla]], who left the room and commandeered an incoming ballot box, replacing it with one apparently prepared ahead of time and containing forged votes which favored President Roslin. When these votes were tallied, President Roslin was announced as having won re-election. Tom Zarek was suspicious of the results, but Baltar personally assured him that Roslin would not engage in electoral fraud.<ref name=\"Lay Down Your Burdens\"/>\n\nThe small conspiracy quickly unraveled, however, when Lieutenant Felix Gaeta noticed that the forged ballots had Vice-President Baltar's first name spelled correctly (Gaeta knew that the ship in question had a set of misprinted ballots). He brought this to the attention of Tigh, who insisted that he would handle the situation, after which Gaeta grew suspicious and personally alerted Admiral Adama. Adama, in turn, privately informed Roslin, who then herself confessed to authorizing her campaign manager's subterfuge. Adama eventually convinced Roslin that, despite the likelihood that a Baltar presidency would be \"disastrous,\" they should announce that there had been a \"tabulation error\" and allow Baltar to take office rather than betraying their principles.<ref name=\"Lay Down Your Burdens\"/>\n\n===On New Caprica===\nAfter leaving office, Roslin settled on New Caprica. She resumes her old occupation as a school teacher and aids in the care of [[Sharon Agathon]]'s half-Cylon, half-human baby, [[Hera (Cylon-Human)|Hera/Isis]].<ref name=\"Lay Down Your Burdens\"/>\n\nDuring this period, the relationship between Roslin and Adama evolves. During Adama's sole visit to the colony, Roslin shares her dream of building a cabin in the mountains of New Caprica with Adama, and the two are shown spending the night smoking a native herb, and talking about what is to become of the fleet.\n\nBut after a year on New Caprica, the Cylons discover the colony, which under Baltar's leadership immediately surrenders. While Roslin does not actively participate in the underground resistance movement, Colonel Tigh subordinates himself and his insurgent force to Roslin and Vice President [[Tom Zarek]]'s ''de facto'' government-in-waiting. Roslin and her aide, Tory Foster, make a detailed list of the colonists who collaborate with the Cylons for later use, if and when the Cylons are ever driven off the planet.\n\nWhen Tigh orders the use of [[Suicide attack|suicide bombers]], Roslin is arrested on suspicion of aiding in Tigh's decision. Roslin is freed by Baltar, who knowing that Roslin would never approve of such tactics, attempts, unsuccessfully, to get her to join him in jointly denouncing Tigh's actions. Days later, Roslin is re-arrested and nearly executed alongside a large group of suspected resistance members, but is saved by the resistance. One of the other suspected resistance members is Zarek, who used the opportunity to confirm that she tried to steal the presidential election. When she admitted she did, he told her he wished she had gone through with it.<ref name=\"Exodus\">{{cite episode| episodelink=Exodus (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Exodus| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}</ref>\n\nDuring the final battle of New Caprica, Roslin evacuates aboard ''Colonial One'', referring to it as \"my ship\" to Vice President Zarek who defers to her, tacitly acknowledging her inevitable return to office.\n\n===After New Caprica===\nAboard ''Colonial One'' Tory Foster apologetically informs Roslin that Isis/Hera and her adoptive mother cannot be accounted for and are believed to have been either killed or recaptured during the exodus from New Caprica.\n\nAfter the fleet is reunited after their escape from New Caprica, Vice President Tom Zarek ascends to the presidency in light of Baltar's abandonment of the office during the exodus. Zarek agrees that as soon as a new Quorum of Twelve is elected is found, he will name Roslin as his VP, then step down, making her again President, as he knows he could not continue as President without Adama's support. For his cooperation, Zarek asks for only a place in Roslin's new administration; but in appreciation of his refusing to cooperate with Baltar on New Caprica, Roslin says she will name him the new VP which clearly surprises Zarek.  Before Roslin can take office, however, Zarek in conjunction with [[Saul Tigh]] forms a retribution tribunal known as \"The Circle\", empowering them to investigate allegations of collaboration, and to summarily try and execute the collaborators, all in secret and without normal due process protections. When Roslin and Adama find out, they halt the Circle proceedings. Zarek justifies his actions saying that the fleet needs quick justice to prevent chaos and that Roslin's new mandate needs to start with clean hands.. After she takes office, Roslin declares a general amnesty for all Cylon collaborators and establishes a Truth and Reconciliation Committee to bring the fleet together.\n\nUpon meeting a delegation from the Cylons (Gaius Baltar, a Brother Cavil, a Number 3 and Boomer), after discovering the \"Temple of the Five\" on a newly discovered planet (nicknamed the \"Algae planet\", due to its large swathes of algae), Roslin's theft of the hybrid baby Hera is revealed.  There is a stand-off between the humans and Cylons, complicated by the planetary system's star being on the brink of going [[supernova]]. Roslin's religious insights prove useful when it comes time to determining what parts of the Temple's inscriptions relate to Earth, and perhaps what parts relate to the Cylons.  She starts to see that there may be more than a single purpose for the Temple, and that its role in Colonial religious doctrine might not be the only one \u2014 perhaps it had messages for both the Cylons and humanity.<ref name=\"TakingABreak\">{{cite episode| episodelink=Taking a Break From All Your Worries (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Taking a Break From All Your Worries| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}</ref>\n\nDuring the escape from the Algae Planet, Baltar is captured by the Colonials.<ref name=\"Rapture\">{{cite episode| episodelink=Rapture (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Rapture| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}</ref> Following his capture, Baltar is subjected to sleep-deprivation, force-feeding, and a radical form of hallucinogen-based interrogation, and then offered the possibility of escaping execution in exchange for cooperation, as Adama, Tigh and Roslin seek to learn any clues to Earth's location. When all of these stratagems fail, Baltar asks for a fair trial. Roslin rejects Adama's suggestion that Baltar be made to \"simply disappear\", and orders him to be given a fair trial for his crimes, even after a warning from Tom Zarek that doing so will provoke dangerous unrest among the fleet's civilian and military populations alike.\n\n===Returning health troubles===\nDuring Baltar's trial, it is revealed that Roslin's cancer has reappeared and that she is once again taking chamalla. Lee Adama, acting as part of Baltar's defense, argues that this makes her an illegitimate witness in Baltar's trial because of chamalla's hallucinogenic effects.<ref name=\"Crossroads Pt. 1\">{{cite episode| episodelink=Crossroads (Battlestar Galactica)| title=Crossroads| series=[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)]]}}</ref> Baltar is acquitted, leaving Roslin with nothing but her secret illness exposed. She begins to experience shared visions (with Sharon Agathon and Number Six) which involve the human-cylon hybrid child, Hera.\n\n===Route of the gods is challenged===\nIn the opening fourth season premiere ''[[He That Believeth In Me]]'', the return of [[Kara Thrace]], presumed dead by the fleet for two months, alarms and angers Roslin, as she is convinced that Thrace's resurrection verifies her as a Cylon. Thrace's own conviction that she has visited Earth leads to conflict when Kara insists that the route given to the fleet by the Eye of Jupiter is false, and that they are pulling away from Earth's correct route, causing her great pain. Panicking, she attempts to force Roslin to turn back by infiltrating her quarters and aiming a gun at her head. She is apprehended, but not before Kara gives Roslin the chance to shoot her. Roslin fires the gun, but misses at close range. Adama later chastises Roslin, accusing her of not trusting Kara because she fears she will lose the people to a new \"visionary\" and die alone, powerless.\n\n===Deterioration, resting demons, and redemption===\nAs Roslin begins to deteriorate further, she discovers that the continued political intervention of Lee Adama (now a member of the Quorum) has placed a strain on her ability to maintain her normal routines of classified police sanctions concerning fleetwide security, as well as her relentless bias against Baltar. She briefly bonds with a cancer-ridden patient, Emily, who shares with Roslin views on death before succumbing to her illness. Roslin then resumes her duties.\n\nWhen Kara Thrace returns to the fleet in a crippled Cylon Basestar, Laura, along with Baltar, is invited aboard by a rebel Cylon crew, who are on the run and intent on finding D'anna (Number Three), who knows the identities of the [[Cylon (reimagining)#The \"Final Five\" Humanoid Cylons|Final Five]] Cylons. Roslin is taken hostage along with Baltar and several Galactica pilots when Sharon \"Athena\" Agathon guns down Natalie, a more assertive copy of Number Six and the leader of the rebel Cylons, in a misguided attempt to thwart the vision she shares with Roslin from coming to pass.\n\nAs the Cylon Basestar jumps towards the location of the Cylon Resurrection Hub, Roslin begins to experience visions of her impending death, and gradually begins to learn she has taken much in her life for granted, including the love of William Adama and his family.\n\nRoslin gives the go-ahead for a mission to destroy the Cylon hub and retrieve the resurrected D'anna, but also requests that she be given exclusive access to her, violating an agreement between the humans and Cylons to mutually question D'anna.\n\nDuring the assault on the Hub by the human and Cylon alliance, Baltar is severely injured in an explosion, and in a delirious state of self-loathing and desperation, he confesses to Roslin that he is to blame for the attacks on the Colonies. Roslin, initially angry, attempts to murder Baltar by removing his dressings and allowing him to bleed to death, but her conscience tears at her until she relents, and she chooses to spare her enemy rather than die with blood on her hands.\n\nThe Basestar returns to the fleet, where Laura reunites with Adama and finally declares her love for him, to which he replies, \"About time\".\n\n===\"Earth\"===\n\nUpon returning to the fleet with Adama, Laura does not immediately take back her role as President, instead watching Lee Adama take full control of the role and handling a hostage crisis initiated by D'anna. After the location of Earth has been verified from the co-ordinates supplied by Kara Thrace's Viper, an emotional Laura orders the fleet to jump to Earth, where the crew discover to their horror that the planet is a nuclear wasteland and virtually uninhabitable. Laura then suffers a crisis of faith due to the guilt of leading her people on a pointless journey. She burns the book of Pythia, chooses to stop taking her cancer medication, and also develops a romantic relationship with Admiral Adama.\n\nDuring [[Tom Zarek]] and [[Felix Gaeta]]'s attempted [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] and mutiny, Laura evades capture initially because the plotters are unaware that she had secretly taken up residence in Adama's quarters. She is shepherded by loyalists to an abandoned auxiliary docking port after attempting to make a broadcast denouncing the mutiny. From the docking port, she is spirited away to the rebel Cylon baseship.  The rebel Cylons remain loyal to Laura and form a de facto [[government in exile]] around her. They originally try to jump away, but after she makes a passionate speech in support of Adama, they decide to stay and a Two even helps her make a broadcast about the mutiny through Gaeta's jamming. Her heart is broken by Zarek's false report that Adama and Tigh had been killed, but her spirit is not; she vows to defeat the mutineers and commands her Cylon forces to attack ''Galactica''.  Gaeta tries to jump away instead, but Tyrol disables ''Galactica's'' FTL drive.  Faced with having to fight Roslin and lose more lives, Gaeta stands down and Adama and his loyalists retake the ship moments later.  Roslin is visibly relieved when Adama contacts her to let her know he's in command again and to stand down and Roslin (and even a Number Eight) breaks down crying and the two are joyfully reunited later.\n\nIn the wake of the failed coup, during which most members of the Quorum of the Twelve are assassinated, Roslin appoints Councilman [[Lee Adama]] as Vice President and agrees to his suggestion of a reorganized Quorum based not on the original [[Twelve Colonies]], but on representatives from each ship in the fleet, including the rebel [[Cylon (reimagining)|Cylon]] [[basestar]] whose councilman, [[Six (Battlestar Galactica)#Other versions|Sonja Six]], she warmly congratulates on her election to the new Quorum and welcomes into the government.\n\nShe also develops some form of mental link between herself, Caprica Six, Sharon \"Athena\" Agathon and the child Hera. This resulted in her collapse when during \"Someone To Watch Over Me\", when she somehow sensed  that Hera was taken by Boomer to Cavil. This link may be connected to a comment made by Ellen Tigh about something manipulating the entire events happening in the Battlestar Universe.\n\nEver since her collapse, Roslin has been in sickbay and is clearly not doing well.  She convinces Adama that he has to abandon ''Galactica'' which is now falling apart. After hearing Cottle and Ishay discussing Adama's planned rescue mission of Hera, Roslin, when alone, gets out of bed, gets dressed and makes her way to the hangar to volunteer for the rescue mission despite hardly being able to walk.  She asks Adama jokingly if he was planning on going without her and he accepts her help on the mission.  She is given injections to keep herself on her feet for two days, but is warned it will use up what little life she has left.  With both she and Vice President Adama taking part in the mission, Roslin appoints attorney and political kingmaker [[Romo Lampkin]] as a reluctant acting president; she and/or Admiral Adama similarly brevets Lieutenant [[List of minor characters in Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)#Hoshi.2C Lt. Louis|Louis Hoshi]] to the rank of Rear Admiral and commander of the fleet. During the battle, Roslin serves in sickbay and helps Hera avoid Cavil and other Centurions that have boarded ''Galactica'' as well as finally realizing the truth of her Opera House vision.\n\nAfter Hera is rescued and the Cylon colony is left to fall into a black hole, Kara Thrace inputs a set of co-ordinates into the navigational computer and the ''Galactica'' jumps far away to a habitable blue planet with a moon. The recognizable continent of Africa is seen clearly from orbit. The planet is our own Earth. Joined later by the rest of the colonial fleet, the colonials decide to settle on the new world where primitive humans already live. Roslin, while sitting with Adama, asks him what the name of the planet should be, to which he replies \"Earth\", naming it after the devastated planet they found some time ago since this new world has ended up being the sanctuary they were always looking for. Now with Roslin close to death, Adama asks Roslin if she wants to see the wildlife of the planet closer and he then takes her on a flight across the African continent in a Raptor. During the flight she utters her last words, \"So much... life,\" and dies peacefully. Heartbroken, Adama puts his wedding ring on Roslin's finger. This fulfils the [[Moses|Mosaic]] prophecy that the anointed leader will \"guide the caravan of the heavens to their new homeland\" but the leader will not live to enter the new land.  Adama buries her on the hilltop where he intends to build their cabin and visits her grave often. Lampkin is last seen exercising leadership among the settlers.\n\n==Development==\nUnlike most of the other central human characters at start of the series, Roslin has no direct analogue in the original 1978 program, though a character named Siress Tinia (played by [[Ina Balin]]) featured in the original series episode \"[[Baltar's Escape]]\". In that episode, Tinia is a member of the Quorum of Twelve, assigned to shadow Adama as an \"advisor\" and the Quorum's official representative. She sometimes comes into conflict with Adama and challenges his decisions, much like Laura Roslin does with Commander William Adama, though the two eventually grow to respect each other.\n\nWhile it may be a coincidence, her name is an amalgam of the forenames of the [[First Lady of the United States|U.S. First Ladies]] in 2003 and 1978: [[Laura Bush]] and [[Rosalynn Carter]]. According to McDonnell, influences for the character included [[Madeleine Albright]] and [[Hillary Clinton]].<ref>[https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/battlestar-galacticast-mary-mcdonnell-at-eccc-2019 Battlestar Galacticast: Mary McDonnell at ECCC 2019]</ref>\n\nExecutive producer [[Ronald D.

Although it is now a political party without any parliamentary representation, the party's candidates have been elected to the [[Parliament of Canada]], the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario|Ontario legislature]], the [[Legislative Assembly of Manitoba|Manitoba legislature]], and various municipal governments across the country. The party has also contributed significantly to [[trade union]] organizing and [[Labor history (discipline)|labour history]] in Canada, [[peace movement|peace and anti-war]] activism, and many other [[social movements]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Alvin Finkel|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/workers-unity-league|title=Workers Unity League|encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=September 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Communist Party of Canada is the second oldest active party after the [[Liberal Party of Canada]]. In 1993 the party was de-registered and had its assets seized, forcing it to begin a successful thirteen-year political and legal battle to maintain registration of small political parties in Canada. The campaign culminated with the final decision of ''[[Figueroa v. Canada]]'', changing the legal definition of a political party in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://this.org/magazine/2010/04/05/communist-party-canada-miguel-figueroa/|title=THIS  \u2192  How the Communist Party changed Canadian elections forever|website=this.org|accessdate=October 3, 2017}}</ref> Despite its continued presence as a registered political party, the CPC places the vast majority of its emphasis on extra-parliamentary activity what it terms \"the labour and people's movements\", as reflected in its programme \"Canada's Future is Socialism\".\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe Canadian Communist Party began as an illegal organization in a rural barn near the town of [[Guelph]], [[Ontario]], on May 28 and 29, 1921. Many of its founding members had worked as labour organizers and as anti-war activists and had belonged to groups such as the [[Socialist Party of Canada]], [[One Big Union (Canada)|One Big Union]], the [[Socialist Labor Party]], the [[Industrial Workers of the World]], and other [[socialist]], [[Marxist]], or [[Labour Party (Canada)|Labour parties]] or clubs and organizations. The first members felt inspired by the [[Russian Revolution]], and radicalised by the negative aftermath of [[World War I]] and the fight to improve living standards and labour rights, including the experience of the [[Winnipeg General Strike]].  The [[Comintern]] accepted the party affiliation as its Canadian section in December 1921, and thus it adopted a similar organizational structure and policy to [[Communist party|Communist parties]] around the world.\n\nThe party alternated between legality and illegality during the 1920s and 1930s. Because of the [[War Measures Act]] in effect at its time of creation, the party operated as the \"Workers' Party of Canada\" in February 1922 as its public face, and in March began publication of a newspaper, ''The Worker''. When Parliament allowed the War Measures Act to lapse in 1924, the underground organization was dissolved and the party's name was changed to the Communist Party of Canada.\n\nThe party's first actions included establishing a youth organization, the [[Young Communist League of Canada]], and solidarity efforts with the [[Soviet Union]]. By 1923 the party had raised over $64,000 for the Russian Red Cross, a very large sum of money at that time. It also initiated a Canadian component of the [[Trade Union Educational League]] (TUEL) which quickly became an organic part of the labour movement with active groups in 16 of 60 labour councils and in mining and logging camps. By 1925 party membership stood at around 4,500 people, composed mainly of miners and lumber workers, and of railway, farm, and garment workers.<ref>\n{{cite book|last=Communist Party of Canada|title=Canada's Party of Socialism|year=1982|publisher=Progress Books|location=Toronto|isbn=0-919396-45-3|pages=29, 33, 34}}\n</ref> Most of these people came from immigrant communities like Finns and Ukrainians.\n\nThe party, working with the TUEL, played a role in many bitter strikes and difficult organizing drives, and in support of militant [[industrial unionism]]. From 1922 to 1929, the provincial wings of the WPC/CPC also affiliated with the [[Canadian Labour Party]], another expression of the CPC's \"united front\" strategy. The CLP operated as a federated labour party. The CPC came to lead the CLP organization in several regions of the country, including Quebec, and did not run candidates during elections. In 1925 William Kolisnyk became the first communist elected to public office in North America, under the banner of the CLP in Winnipeg. The CLP itself, however, never became an effective national organization. The Communists withdrew from the CLP in 1928-1929 following a shift in [[Comintern]] policy, as the organization folded.\n\n=== Debates, arguments and expulsions ===\nFrom 1927 to 1929, the party went through a series of policy debates and internal ideological struggles in which  advocates of the ideas of [[Leon Trotsky]], as well as proponents of what the party called \"North American Exceptionism\", were expelled. Expellees included [[Maurice Spector]], the editor of the party's paper ''The Worker'' and party chairman, and [[Jack MacDonald (communist)|Jack MacDonald]] (who had supported Spector's expulsion) who resigned as the party's general secretary for factionalism, and was expelled.<ref>Busky, Donald F.

The party also expelled supporters of [[Nikolai Bukharin]] and of [[Jay Lovestone]]'s [[Right Opposition]], such as [[William Moriarty]]. The communists disagreed over strategy, tactics, the socialist identity of the [[Soviet Union]], and over Canada's status as an imperialist power.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040102205247/http://www.marxists.org/history/international/comintern/sections/canada/buck-tim/30years/ch05.htm]</ref> While some communists like [[J. B. Salsberg]] expressed sympathy with these positions, after debates that dominated party conventions for a couple of years by the early 1930s, the vast majority of members had decided to continue with the party.\n\n[[Tim Buck]] won election as party [[general secretary]] in 1929. He remained in the position until 1962.\n\n=== Great Depression ===\nThe [[Great Depression|stock market crash]] in late 1929 signalled the beginning of a long and protracted economic crisis in Canada and internationally. The crisis quickly led to widespread unemployment, poverty, destitution, and suffering among working families and farmers. The [[1930 Canadian federal election|general election of 1930]], brought to power the [[R.B. Bennett]] Conservative government who attacked the labour movement and established \"relief camps\" for young unemployed men.\n\nThe CPC was the only party to make a systemic critique of the depression as an alleged crisis of capitalism.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} It was also the first political party in Canada to call for the introduction of unemployment insurance, a national health insurance scheme, making education universally accessible, social and employment assistance to youth, labour legislation including health and safety regulations, regulation of the working day and holidays, a minimum wage for women and youth, and state-run [[crop insurance]] and price control for farmers.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn 1931, eight of the CPC's leaders were arrested and imprisoned under [[Section 98]] of Canada's [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]], which outlawed advocacy of force or violence to bring about political change. The party continued to exist, but was under the constant threat of legal harassment, and was for all intents and purposes an underground organization. In 1934 a massive campaign pushed back the police's practice which supporters characterized as repression, and the communists were released. On the release of Tim Buck, the party held a mass rally attended by an overflow crowd of over 17,000 supporters and sympathizers in [[Maple Leaf Gardens]].\n\nAlthough the party was banned, it organized large mass organizations such as the [[Workers' Unity League]] (WUL), and the [[Canadian Labour Defence League]] that played an important role in historic strikes like that of miners in [[Estevan]]. From 1933 to 1936, the WUL led 90 per cent of the strikes in Canada. Already, conditions had taught social democrats, reformists, and the communists important lessons of cooperation. In 1934, in accordance with the re-examined position of the Comintern, the CPC adopted a strategy and tactics based on a united front against fascism.\n\nIn the prairies, the Communists organized the Farmers Unity League which mobilized against evictions and rallied hundreds of farmers into protest Hunger Marches, despite police brutality. Party members were also active in the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]]' attempt to unionize the auto and other industrial sectors including Steelworkers, the [[Canadian Seamen's Union]], the [[Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers Union]], the [[International Woodworkers of America]], and the [[United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America]].\n\nAmong the poor and unemployed, Communists organized groups like the left-wing Workers Sports Association, one of the few ways that working-class youth had access to recreational programmes. The [[Relief Camp Workers' Union]] and the National Unemployed Workers Association played significant roles in organizing the unskilled and the unemployed in protest marches and demonstrations and campaigns such as the \"[[On-to-Ottawa Trek]]\" and the 1938 Vancouver Post Office sit-down strike.\n\nInternationally, the party initiated the mobilization of the over 1,500 person [[Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion]] to fight in the [[Spanish Civil War]] as part of the [[International Brigade]]. Among the leading Canadian Communists involved in that effort was Dr. [[Norman Bethune]], who is known for his invention of a mobile blood-transfusion unit, early advocacy of Medicare in Canada, and work with the [[Communist Party of China]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].\n\nSolidarity efforts for the Spanish Civil War and many labour and social struggles during the Depression resulted in much cooperation between members of the CPC and the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF). After 1935 the CPC advocated electoral alliances and unity with the CCF on key issues. The proposal was debated in the CCF, with the 1936 BC, Alberta and Saskatchewan conventions generally supporting cooperation while the Ontario convention opposed. While the motion was defeated at that Parties third federal convention, the Communists continued to call for a united front.\n\nThe call was particularly urgent in Quebec, where in 1937 the Duplessis government passed \"an act to protect Qu\u00e9bec against communist propaganda\" giving the police the power to padlock any premises used by \"communists\" (which was undefined in the legislation).\n\n=== World War II ===\n[[File:Tim Buck at Maple Leaf Gardens.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Communist Labour and Total War Committee meeting, with Tim Buck]]\n\nAlthough the Communist Party had worked hard to warn Canadians about what it considered to be a growing fascist danger, after some debate the Party saw the opening of World War II not as an anti-fascist war but a battle between capitalist nations. Most likely this conclusion was supported by the policies of the big powers. Many voices in the British establishment, for example, called loudly for support of [[Adolf Hitler]] against the USSR. Meanwhile, having failed in reaching agreement with Britain and other world powers, the USSR signed the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] with Nazi Germany, to bide time before an inevitable war between the two.\n \nThe Communist Party's opposition to [[World War II]] led to it being banned under the [[Defence of Canada Regulations]] of the [[War Measures Act]] in 1940 shortly after Canada entered into the war. In many cases Communist leaders were interned in camps, long before fascists. As growing numbers of Communist Party leaders were interned, some members went underground or exile in the United States. Conditions in the camps were harsh. A civil rights campaign was launched by the wives of many of the interned men for family visits and their release.\n\nWith Germany's [[Operation Barbarossa|1941 invasion of the USSR]] and the collapse of the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] the party argued that the nature of the war had changed to a genuine anti-fascist struggle. The CPC reversed its opposition to the war and argued the danger to the working class on the international level superseded its interests nationally.\n\nDuring the [[Conscription Crisis of 1944]], the banned CPC set up \"Tim Buck Plebiscite Committees\" across the country to campaign for a \"yes\" vote in the national referendum on [[conscription]]. Following the vote, the committees were renamed the [[Dominion Communist-Labor Total War Committee]] and urged full support for the war effort, a no-strike pledge for the duration of the war and increased industrial production. The [[National Council for Democratic Rights]] was also established with [[A.E. Smith]] as chair in order to rally for the legalization of the Communist Party and the release of Communists and anti-fascists from internment.\n\nThe party's first elected [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) was [[Dorise Nielsen]]. Nielsen was elected in North Battleford, Saskatchewan in 1940 under the [[popular front]] [[Unity (Canada)|Progressive Unity]] label, with the support of many individual CCFers. Nielsen kept her membership in the party a secret until 1943.\n\n=== Labor-Progressive Party and the Cold War ===\n{{main|Labor-Progressive Party}}\n[[File:Fred rose2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Fred Rose re-election poster]]\n\nThe Communist Party remained banned, but with the entry of the Soviet Union into the war and the eventual release of the Canadian party's interned leaders, Canadian Communists founded the Labor-Progressive Party (LPP) in 1943 as a legal front and thereafter ran candidates under that name until 1959. At its height in the mid-1940s, the party had fourteen sitting elected officials at the federal, provincial and municipal level. Several prominent elected party members were:\n* [[Dorise Nielsen]], a Saskatchewan MP elected as a [[Unity (Canada)|Unity]] candidate in 1940, declared her affiliation with the LPP when it was formed in August 1943 and ran unsuccessfully for re-election as an LPP candidate.\n* [[Fred Rose (politician)|Fred Rose]] was elected to represent a Montreal [[Electoral district (Canada)|riding]] in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] as an LPP MP, and was removed from office after being convicted of spying for the Soviet Union.\n* [[Mary Kardash]] and [[William Ross (Manitoba politician)|William Ross]] were LPP and then Communist school trustees in [[Winnipeg]]\n* [[Jacob Penner]] and [[Joseph Zuken]] were popular [[alderman|aldermen]] in Winnipeg. Zuken was an LPP school trustee before succeeding Penner on city council by which time the LPP had changed its name back to the Communist Party.\n* [[Bill Kardash]] and [[James Litterick]] were [[Manitoba]] LPP [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|Members of the Legislative Assembly]] (MLAs).\n* [[A.A. MacLeod]] and [[J.B. Salsberg]] were LPP members of the Ontario [[legislature]].\n* [[Stanley Br\u00e9haut Ryerson]], [[Sam Carr]], Charles Simms and Norman Freed were LPP [[Toronto]] aldermen while [[Stewart Smith (politician)|Stewart Smith]] was elected to the city's [[Board of Control (municipal government)|Board of Control]], Edna Ryerson, Elizabeth Morton and John Boyd were elected to the School Board in 1944.\n* [[Harry Rankin]] sat on [[Vancouver]]'s [[Vancouver City Council|city council]] on behalf of the [[Coalition of Progressive Electors|Committee of Progressive Electors]] which he helped found in the late 1960s. Though not officially a Communist Party member he was a [[fellow traveller]].\n* The small rural municipality of Clayton, Saskatchewan elected a Communist mayor to one of its tiny towns\n* [[Blairmore, Alberta]] elected a Communist majority town council and school board in 1933 and renamed the main street \"Tim Buck Avenue\" and the main park \"Karl Marx Park\"\n\nIn 1946, [[Igor Gouzenko]], a cipher clerk at the Soviet Embassy, defected to Canada alleging several Canadian communists were operating a spy ring which provided the Soviet Union with [[Classified information|top secret]] information. The [[Kellock-Taschereau Commission]] was called by Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] to investigate the matter. This led to the convictions of [[Fred Rose (politician)|Fred Rose]] and other communists.\n\n[[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s 1956 [[Secret Speech]] exposing the crimes of [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[1956 Hungarian Revolution|the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary]] shook the faith of many Communists around the world. As well, the party was riven by a crisis following the return of prominent party member [[J.B. Salsberg]] from a trip to the Soviet Union where he found rampant party-sponsored antisemitism. Salsberg reported his findings but they were rejected by the party, which suspended him from its leading bodies. The crisis resulted in the departure of the [[United Jewish Peoples' Order]], Salsberg, [[Robert Laxer]] and most of the party's Jewish members in 1956.\n\nMany, perhaps most, members of the Canadian party left, including a number of prominent party members. \nIn the mid-1960s the [[United States Department of State]] estimated the party membership to be approximately 3500.<ref>Benjamin, Roger W.; Kautsky, John H.. ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1953329 Communism and Economic Development]'', in The [[American Political Science Review]], Vol. 62, No. 1. (Mar. 1968), pp. 122.</ref> The Soviet Union's [[Prague spring|1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia]] caused more people to leave the Canadian Communist Party. Many women were likewise deterred from engaging with Canadian Communism as the Party was somewhat resistant to their politics. The Party may have countered that the discussions of sex, gender, and women's politics held the potential to veer away from the overarching goal of class revolution, for example, many radical women recalled the hypocrisy of Party men who refused to discuss sex despite carrying on numerous extramarital affairs.<ref>Beswick, Lorne. \"Reds in Beds: The Communist Party of Canada and the Politics of Reproduction, 1920-1970,\" (PhD diss., Queen's University, 2017), 269-70.</ref>\n\nThe party was also active in indigenous people's struggles. For example, [[James P. Brady]] and Malcom Norris were founders of the Metis Associations of Saskatchewan and Alberta in the 1940s and 1950s.\n\n=== Collapse of the Soviet bloc and party split ===\n[[File:William Kashtan.jpg|thumb|right|200px|William Kashtan]]\nIn common with most communist parties, it went through a crisis after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], and subsequently split. Under then general secretary George Hewison (1988\u201391), the leadership of the CPC and a segment of its general membership began to abandon Marxism\u2013Leninism as the basis of the Party's revolutionary perspective, and ultimately moved to liquidate the Party itself, seeking to replace it with a left, social democratic entity.\n\nThe protracted ideological and political crisis created much confusion and disorientation within the ranks of the Party, and paralysed both its independent and united front work for over two years. The Hewison-led majority in the Central Committee (CC) of the party voted to abandon Marxism\u2013Leninism. An orthodox minority in the CC, led by [[Miguel Figueroa]], [[Elizabeth Rowley]] and former leader [[William Kashtan]], resisted this effort. At the 28th Convention in the fall of 1990, the Hewison group managed to maintain its control of the Central Committee of the CPC, but by the spring of 1991, the membership began to turn more and more against the reformist policies and orientation of the Hewison leadership.\n\nKey provincial conventions were held in 1991 in the two main provincial bases of the CPC - British Columbia and Ontario. At the BC convention, delegates threw out Fred Wilson, one of the main leaders of the Hewison group. A few months later in June 1991, Ontario delegates rejected a concerted campaign by Hewison and his supporters, and overwhelmingly reelected provincial leader Elizabeth Rowley and other supporters of the Marxist\u2013Leninist current to the Ontario Committee and Executive.\n\nThe Hewison group moved on August 27, 1991 to expel eleven of the key leaders of the opposition, including Rowley, Emil Bjarnason, and former central organizer John Bizzell. The Hewison-controlled Central Executive also dismissed the Ontario provincial committee.\n\nThe vast majority of local clubs and committees of the CPC opposed the expulsions, and called instead for an extraordinary convention of the party to resolve the deepening crisis in a democratic manner. There were loud protests at the CC's October 1991 meeting, but an extraordinary convention was not convened. With few remaining options, Rowley and the other expelled members threatened to take the Hewison group to court. After several months of negotiations between the Hewison group and the opposition \"All-Canada Negotiating Committee\", an out-of-court settlement resulted in the Hewison leadership agreeing to leave the CPC and relinquish any claim to the party's name, while taking most of the party's assets to the Cecil-Ross Society, a publishing and educational foundation previously associated with the party.\n\nFollowing the departure of the Hewison-led group, a convention was held in December 1992 at which delegates agreed to continue the Communist Party (thus the meeting was titled the 30th CPC Convention). Delegates rejected the reformist policies instituted by the Hewison group and instead reaffirmed the CPC as a Marxist\u2013Leninist organization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://communist-party.ca/chapter-8-the-communist-party|title=Chapter 8:  THE COMMUNIST PARTY \u00bb Communist Party of Canada - Parti Communiste du Canada|work=communist-party.ca|accessdate=October 15, 2016}}</ref> Since most of the old party's assets were now the property of the Hewison-led Cecil Ross Society, the CPC convention decided to launch a new newspaper, the ''[[People's Voice (newspaper)|People's Voice]]'', to replace the old ''Canadian Tribune''. The convention elected a new central committee with Figueroa as Party Leader. The convention also amended the party constitution to grant more membership control and lessen the arbitrary powers of the CC, while maintaining democratic centralism as its organizational principle.\n\nMeanwhile, the former Communists retained the [[Cecil-Ross Society]] as a political foundation to continue their political efforts. They also sold off the party's headquarters at 24 Cecil Street, having earlier liquidated various party-related business such as Eveready Printers (the party printshop) and Progress Publishers. The name of the Cecil-Ross Society comes from the intersection of Cecil Street and Ross Street in [[Toronto]] where the headquarters of the party was located. The Cecil-Ross Society took with it the rights to the ''Canadian Tribune'', which had been the party's weekly newspaper for decades, as well as roughly half of the party's assets. The Cecil-Ross Society ended publication of the ''Canadian Tribune'' and attempted to launch a new broad-left magazine, ''New Times'' which failed after a few issues and then ''Ginger'' which was only published twice.\n\n=== The Figueroa Case ===\nThe renovated party, although with a much smaller membership and resources (such as the former headquarters at 24 Cecil Street in Toronto and party printing press) now faced further challenges and threats to its existence. New electoral laws mandated that any political party which failed to field 50 candidates in a general federal election would be automatically de-registered and its assets seized. The CPC was not in a position to run 50 candidates in the 1993 federal election (it fielded only eight candidates during that election), and therefore its assets were seized and the party was de-listed. The CPC had sought an interim injunction to prevent its imminent de-registration, but this legal action failed.\n\nA prolonged thirteen-year political and legal battle, ''[[Figueroa v. Canada]]'' ensued, which won the support of widespread popular opinion, reflected in a number of members of parliament openly supporting the challenge and other small political parties joining the case, most notably the [[Green Party of Canada|Green Party]]. Never before had a single court challenge resulted in legislative action on three separate occasions to amend a standing law. Bill C-2 (2000) amended the Canada Elections Act to (among other things) remove the unconstitutional seizure of party assets for failure to field 50 candidates in a general election and provided for the full refund of candidates' deposits. The party had its deregistration overturned and its seized assets restored. Bill C-9 (2001) reduced the threshold from 50 to 12 candidates for the party identifier to appear on the ballot. Bill C-3 (2003) scrapped the 50-candidate rule altogether for party registration. This victory was celebrated by many of the other small parties \u2013 regardless of political differences \u2013 on the principle that it was a victory for the people's right to democratic choice.\n\nDuring this time the CPC began to publish a fortnightly newspaper called ''[[People's Voice (newspaper)|People's Voice]]''. Its Quebec section, le [[Parti communiste du Qu\u00e9bec]], was reorganized. The CPC also began periodically publishing a theoretical/discussion journal ''Spark!''. In 2001 the party released its full programme.\n\n[[File:YCL-LJC central convention in Toronto, 2007.jpg|thumb|right|200px|YCL rebuilding convention in Toronto]]\n\nThe CPC re-launched its long-standing contribution to the labour movement and support of [[trade union]] organizing and campaigns, in the civic reform movement, and in a number of social justice, anti-war and international solidarity groups and coalitions. In 2007 [[Young Communist League of Canada]] was refounded. Local YCL groups have sprung up in several cities across the country, and the League has since held two central conventions.\n\n=== Quebec communists and the national question ===\n{{main|Communist Party of Quebec}}\n\nThe Communist Party of Canada began organizing in Quebec upon its founding. Many important leaders of the CPC including [[Annie Buller]], [[William Kashtan]], [[Fred Rose (politician)|Fred Rose]], [[Madeleine Parent]], and [[L\u00e9a Roback]] hailed from Montreal, and [[Norman Bethune]] joined the party in Montreal. The Quebec district fought hard battles against the [[Duplessis]] regime, which made the party illegal using the Padlock law, and to organize the unorganized. The election of Fred Rose in [[Cartier (electoral district)|Cartier]] was a major boost to the Quebec communists and reflected the support of the CPC among working-class people in the city.\n\nFor some time the party had been struggling to develop its policy on the national question in Canada, which had changed considerably since the party's formation. As early as the 1930s the CPC recognized Quebec was a nation and by the late 1940s the party began to advocate for Quebec's right to self-determination. In the 1950s and 60s the party clarified this position, becoming the first party to advocate for a democratic solution to the national question and a new \"made-in-Canada\" constitution that would guarantee sovereignty for Quebec, up to and including separation. While supporting the right to separate, the communists opposed the succession of Quebec from Canada, proposing a new equal and voluntary partnership between what was then commonly called French and English Canada.\n\nIn the late 1950s the party finally overturned the [[padlock law]] giving new energy and hope to the party despite difficult times with the [[Khrushchev revelations]] and the continued pressure of the Cold War. Moving to better put into practice what it saw as a deeper political understanding of the national question, the CPC in Quebec re-organized as the Communist Party of Quebec in November 1965, reflecting what it now termed the [[multinational state|multi-national]] reality of Canada as \"a state with more than one nation within its borders\". The PCQ emerged as a \"distinct entity\" of the CPC, with shared membership and, at the same time, full control over its policies and administration including its own constitution.\n\nWith the [[Quiet Revolution]], [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]] and later the [[October Crisis]] the party's position on the national question became the subject of broad debate across the country, and influenced the agreement of the [[Canadian Labour Congress]] to work with the [[Quebec Federation of Labour]] on an equal and voluntary basis. The communists called for workers sympathetic with independence movements to unite on a common, immediate class-based programme of common struggle with English-speaking Canadian workers. The PCQ helped re-launch Montreal's mass May Day demonstrations and advanced many unique policies including the idea of a federated party of labour, which proved its prescience with the formation of [[Qu\u00e9bec solidaire]]. The federated party of labour proposal was endorsed by the late 1960s by most trade union centrals, but the project was eclipsed by the emergence of the [[Parti Quebecois]].\n\nBy the 1980s the CPC and PCQ were calling for \"a new, democratic constitutional arrangement based on the equal and voluntary union of Aboriginal peoples, Qu\u00e9bec, and English-speaking Canada\" replacing the Senate with a house of nations. In this context the PCQ and CPC critically supported the first referendum question on sovereignty association, while later the CPC advocated voting No on the second referendum in 1995.\n\nDuring the crisis in CPC during the 1990s, the PCQ became disorganized, closed its offices, and its remaining members drifted apart from the CPC, with many in the leadership adopting positions sympathetic to nationalism. It was not until 1997 that a range of communists and communist groups came together to re-organize the PCQ. A few years later the party helped bring together different tendencies in the left to form the [[Union des forces progressistes (Canada)|Union of Progressive Forces]] (UFP) which became [[Qu\u00e9bec solidaire]].\n\nThe UFP agreed to place the question of Quebec independence as secondary to social or class issues. This was hotly debated as the party transformed into [[Qu\u00e9bec solidaire]]. The debate moved over into the PCQ as well. These positions were questioned by the Quebec leader of the party, Andr\u00e9 Parizeau, who formulated a series of amendments in support of immediate independence in 2004 which were rejected by both the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the Quebec party (by a vote of 4-2) and by the Central Executive Committee of the Canadian party (by a vote of 7-1).\n\nIn January 2005, Parizeau wrote a letter to PCQ members declaring that the party was in crisis and, describing the four NEC members who opposed his amendments as a pro-federalist \"Gang of Four\", he summarily dismissed them. Although his Quebec nationalist point of view held a slim majority at the PCQ's convention of April 2005, the delegate selection process was highly disputed. Parizeau was subsequently expelled by the Central Committee of the CPC for factionalism and actions harmful to the Party. Around the same time, his group announced their withdrawal from the CPC. The CPC then began to re-organize the PCQ-PCC in Quebec, but the Quebec provincial government authorities continued to recognize Parizeau as holding the electoral registration of the [[Parti communiste du Qu\u00e9bec]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electionsquebec.qc.ca/fr/ppc_liste_partis_candidats.asp?sect=prov&parti=PCQ#texteP|title=- Le Directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des \u00e9lections du Qu\u00e9bec (DGEQ)|work=electionsquebec.qc.ca|accessdate=October 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Central Committee of the party affirmed the authority of the previous Quebec National Executive Committee in June 18\u201319, 2005. The non-registered CPC-aligned PCQ held a new convention which restarted a communist French-language periodical, Clart\u00e9, and later opened an office and small reading room, launched an active website, and re-affiliated with Quebec Solidaire as an organized group. They work closely with the youth and student organization, the \"Ligue de la jeunesse communiste du Quebec\". The CPC's account of this situation is available online,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.communist-party.ca/news/Statements/2005/cpc_pcq_en.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051004191411/http://www.communist-party.ca/news/Statements/2005/cpc_pcq_en.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 4, 2005|title=May Day Statement 2005|date=October 4, 2005|accessdate=October 3, 2017}}</ref> as is the letter from Parizeau's PCQ group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcq.qc.ca/English/OtherPCQ.htm|title=\u00c0 propos de \"l'autre PCQ\"|work=pcq.qc.ca|accessdate=October 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe CPC-aligned PCQ campaigned for a general social (political) strike against the previous Charest Liberal government and the subsequent pro-austerity provincial governments. In 2015 the Parizeau group officially left Quebec Solidaire to support the Parti Quebecois and the campaign of [[Pierre Karl P\u00e9ladeau]].\n\n== 37th and 38th Central Conventions ==\nThe CPC held its 37th Central Convention in February 2013 in Toronto. According to a ''Toronto Star'' article the assembly drew 65 delegates most of whom were from Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec with a few from Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Nova Scotia. Party leader Miguel Figueroa called for the Communists to field 25 candidates in the upcoming federal election.\n\nThe CPC held its 38th Central Convention in May 2016, again in Toronto. The meeting drew about 70-80 delegates from Ontario, British Columbia, Quebec, Manitoba, Alberta, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and New Brunswick, in order of delegation size.  The party held a special tribute to Miguel Figueroa, who had retired before the convention, and elected Elizabeth Rowley as party leader.\n\n== Allied organizations ==\nHistorically, the Communist Party and Labor-Progressive Party have had allied organizations which were affiliated with the party until the late-1920s, and subsequently understood to be largely following the Party's direction. These groups often originated from left wing labour and socialist movements that existed prior to the creation of the Communist Party and operated political and cultural activities amongst various immigrant groups, published magazines and operated their own cultural centres and meeting halls. From the 1920s through the 1950s the largest immigrant groups represented in the party were Finns, Ukrainians and Jews who were organized in the [[Finnish Organization of Canada]] (founded in 1911 as the Finnish Socialist Organization of Canada), the [[Association of United Ukrainian Canadians]] (known as the Ukrainian Labor Farmer Temple Association until 1946) and the [[United Jewish Peoples' Order]] (known as the Labour League until 1945) respectively.\n\nAlso active in the 1930s and 1940s were the [[Hungarian Workers Clubs]], the [[Polish People's Association]] (formerly the Polish Workers' and Farmers' Association), the [[Serbian People's Movement]] and [[Croatian Cultural Association]] (formerly the Jugoslav Workers' Clubs) and the [[Carpatho-Russian Society]]. The [[Russian Farmer-Worker Clubs]] were formed in the early 1930s but closed by the government under the [[Defence of Canada Regulations]] at the outbreak of [[World War II]]. When the Soviet Union became Canada's ally in 1942, they re-appeared as the [[Federation of Russian Canadians]]. The [[Canadian Slav Committee]] was formed in 1948 in an attempt to put party-aligned cultural associations for Ukrainians, Russians, Poles, Slovaks, Bulgarians, Macedonians, Yugoslavs and Carpatho-Rusyns under one umbrella.\n\nThe Society of Capartho-Russian Canadians re-formed and, in 1950, acquired a hall at 280 Queen Street West in Toronto which it continues to operate into the twenty-first century.<ref>https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2019/01/05/the-golden-girls-of-prospect-cemetery.html</ref>\n\nThe UJPO broke with the party in 1956 during the period of the \"Khrushchev revelations\" and allegations of antisemitism in the Soviet Union.\n\nLater allied organizations include the [[Greek Canadian Democratic Organization]] formed by leftists emigres who had fled the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974]] and the [[Portuguese Canadian Democratic Association]] which was formed by left-wing emigres who had left Portugal in the 1960s and early 1970s when it was still ruled by a right wing dictatorship. The Portuguese association was outspoken in its support of the 1974 [[Carnation Revolution]].\n\n== General Secretaries of the CPC ==\n* [[Tom Burpee]] May \u2013 December 1921\n* [[William Moriarty]] 1921\u20131923\n* [[Jack MacDonald (communist)|Jack MacDonald]] 1923\u20131929\n* [[Tim Buck]] 1929\u20131962\n* [[Leslie Morris]] 1962\u20131964\n* [[William Kashtan]] 1965\u20131988\n* [[George Hewison]] 1988\u20131992\n* [[Miguel Figueroa]] 1992\u20132015\n* [[Liz Rowley]] 2016\u2013present<ref>{{cite web|url=http://communist-party.ca/statement/2031#more-2031|title=Communist Party elects first woman leader \u00bb Communist Party of Canada - Parti Communiste du Canada|work=communist-party.ca|accessdate=October 15, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304104544/http://communist-party.ca/statement/2031#more-2031|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Chairmen of the CPC ==\n* [[Maurice Spector]] 1921\u20131928\n* [[Bill Kardash]] 1943\u201319??\n* Tim Buck 1962\u20131973\n\n== Central Executive Committee ==\nThe Communist Party of Canada's 38th convention held in May 2016 elected the following members to its leading body, the Central Executive Committee: [[Elizabeth Rowley]]  (Party leader), Dave McKee (leader of the [[Communist Party of Ontario]]), Pierre Fontaine (leader of the [[Parti communiste du Qu\u00e9bec]]), Drew Garvie (leader of the [[Young Communist League of Canada]]), Jane Bouey (BC Executive member and Chair of the Central Women's Commission), and Kimball Cariou (editor of ''People's Voice'').\n\nThere is also a larger body, the [[Central Committee]], which is elected at convention and meets in intervening years.

Although it is now a political party without any parliamentary representation, the party's candidates have been elected to the [[Parliament of Canada]], the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario|Ontario legislature]], the [[Legislative Assembly of Manitoba|Manitoba legislature]], and various municipal governments across the country. The party has also contributed significantly to [[trade union]] organizing and [[Labor history (discipline)|labour history]] in Canada, [[peace movement|peace and anti-war]] activism, and many other [[social movements]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Alvin Finkel|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/workers-unity-league|title=Workers Unity League|encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=September 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Communist Party of Canada is the second oldest active party after the [[Liberal Party of Canada]]. In 1993 the party was de-registered and had its assets seized, forcing it to begin a successful thirteen-year political and legal battle to maintain registration of small political parties in Canada. The campaign culminated with the final decision of ''[[Figueroa v. Canada]]'', changing the legal definition of a political party in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://this.org/magazine/2010/04/05/communist-party-canada-miguel-figueroa/|title=THIS  \u2192  How the Communist Party changed Canadian elections forever|website=this.org|accessdate=October 3, 2017}}</ref> Despite its continued presence as a registered political party, the CPC places the vast majority of its emphasis on extra-parliamentary activity what it terms \"the labour and people's movements\", as reflected in its programme \"Canada's Future is Socialism\".\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origins ===\nThe Canadian Communist Party began as an illegal organization in a rural barn near the town of [[Guelph]], [[Ontario]], on May 28 and 29, 1921. Many of its founding members had worked as labour organizers and as anti-war activists and had belonged to groups such as the [[Socialist Party of Canada]], [[One Big Union (Canada)|One Big Union]], the [[Socialist Labor Party]], the [[Industrial Workers of the World]], and other [[socialist]], [[Marxist]], or [[Labour Party (Canada)|Labour parties]] or clubs and organizations. The first members felt inspired by the [[Russian Revolution]], and radicalised by the negative aftermath of [[World War I]] and the fight to improve living standards and labour rights, including the experience of the [[Winnipeg General Strike]].  The [[Comintern]] accepted the party affiliation as its Canadian section in December 1921, and thus it adopted a similar organizational structure and policy to [[Communist party|Communist parties]] around the world.\n\nThe party alternated between legality and illegality during the 1920s and 1930s. Because of the [[War Measures Act]] in effect at its time of creation, the party operated as the \"Workers' Party of Canada\" in February 1922 as its public face, and in March began publication of a newspaper, ''The Worker''. When Parliament allowed the War Measures Act to lapse in 1924, the underground organization was dissolved and the party's name was changed to the Communist Party of Canada.\n\nThe party's first actions included establishing a youth organization, the [[Young Communist League of Canada]], and solidarity efforts with the [[Soviet Union]]. By 1923 the party had raised over $64,000 for the Russian Red Cross, a very large sum of money at that time. It also initiated a Canadian component of the [[Trade Union Educational League]] (TUEL) which quickly became an organic part of the labour movement with active groups in 16 of 60 labour councils and in mining and logging camps. By 1925 party membership stood at around 4,500 people, composed mainly of miners and lumber workers, and of railway, farm, and garment workers.<ref>\n{{cite book|last=Communist Party of Canada|title=Canada's Party of Socialism|year=1982|publisher=Progress Books|location=Toronto|isbn=0-919396-45-3|pages=29, 33, 34}}\n</ref> Most of these people came from immigrant communities like Finns and Ukrainians.\n\nThe party, working with the TUEL, played a role in many bitter strikes and difficult organizing drives, and in support of militant [[industrial unionism]]. From 1922 to 1929, the provincial wings of the WPC/CPC also affiliated with the [[Canadian Labour Party]], another expression of the CPC's \"united front\" strategy. The CLP operated as a federated labour party. The CPC came to lead the CLP organization in several regions of the country, including Quebec, and did not run candidates during elections. In 1925 William Kolisnyk became the first communist elected to public office in North America, under the banner of the CLP in Winnipeg. The CLP itself, however, never became an effective national organization. The Communists withdrew from the CLP in 1928-1929 following a shift in [[Comintern]] policy, as the organization folded.\n\n=== Debates, arguments and expulsions ===\nFrom 1927 to 1929, the party went through a series of policy debates and internal ideological struggles in which  advocates of the ideas of [[Leon Trotsky]], as well as proponents of what the party called \"North American Exceptionism\", were expelled. Expellees included [[Maurice Spector]], the editor of the party's paper ''The Worker'' and party chairman, and [[Jack MacDonald (communist)|Jack MacDonald]] (who had supported Spector's expulsion) who resigned as the party's general secretary for factionalism, and was expelled.<ref>Busky, Donald F.

The party also expelled supporters of [[Nikolai Bukharin]] and of [[Jay Lovestone]]'s [[Right Opposition]], such as [[William Moriarty]]. The communists disagreed over strategy, tactics, the socialist identity of the [[Soviet Union]], and over Canada's status as an imperialist power.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040102205247/http://www.marxists.org/history/international/comintern/sections/canada/buck-tim/30years/ch05.htm]</ref> While some communists like [[J. B. Salsberg]] expressed sympathy with these positions, after debates that dominated party conventions for a couple of years by the early 1930s, the vast majority of members had decided to continue with the party.\n\n[[Tim Buck]] won election as party [[general secretary]] in 1929. He remained in the position until 1962.\n\n=== Great Depression ===\nThe [[Great Depression|stock market crash]] in late 1929 signalled the beginning of a long and protracted economic crisis in Canada and internationally. The crisis quickly led to widespread unemployment, poverty, destitution, and suffering among working families and farmers. The [[1930 Canadian federal election|general election of 1930]], brought to power the [[R.B. Bennett]] Conservative government who attacked the labour movement and established \"relief camps\" for young unemployed men.\n\nThe CPC was the only party to make a systemic critique of the depression as an alleged crisis of capitalism.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} It was also the first political party in Canada to call for the introduction of unemployment insurance, a national health insurance scheme, making education universally accessible, social and employment assistance to youth, labour legislation including health and safety regulations, regulation of the working day and holidays, a minimum wage for women and youth, and state-run [[crop insurance]] and price control for farmers.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn 1931, eight of the CPC's leaders were arrested and imprisoned under [[Section 98]] of Canada's [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]], which outlawed advocacy of force or violence to bring about political change. The party continued to exist, but was under the constant threat of legal harassment, and was for all intents and purposes an underground organization. In 1934 a massive campaign pushed back the police's practice which supporters characterized as repression, and the communists were released. On the release of Tim Buck, the party held a mass rally attended by an overflow crowd of over 17,000 supporters and sympathizers in [[Maple Leaf Gardens]].\n\nAlthough the party was banned, it organized large mass organizations such as the [[Workers' Unity League]] (WUL), and the [[Canadian Labour Defence League]] that played an important role in historic strikes like that of miners in [[Estevan]]. From 1933 to 1936, the WUL led 90 per cent of the strikes in Canada. Already, conditions had taught social democrats, reformists, and the communists important lessons of cooperation. In 1934, in accordance with the re-examined position of the Comintern, the CPC adopted a strategy and tactics based on a united front against fascism.\n\nIn the prairies, the Communists organized the Farmers Unity League which mobilized against evictions and rallied hundreds of farmers into protest Hunger Marches, despite police brutality. Party members were also active in the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]]' attempt to unionize the auto and other industrial sectors including Steelworkers, the [[Canadian Seamen's Union]], the [[Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers Union]], the [[International Woodworkers of America]], and the [[United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America]].\n\nAmong the poor and unemployed, Communists organized groups like the left-wing Workers Sports Association, one of the few ways that working-class youth had access to recreational programmes. The [[Relief Camp Workers' Union]] and the National Unemployed Workers Association played significant roles in organizing the unskilled and the unemployed in protest marches and demonstrations and campaigns such as the \"[[On-to-Ottawa Trek]]\" and the 1938 Vancouver Post Office sit-down strike.\n\nInternationally, the party initiated the mobilization of the over 1,500 person [[Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion]] to fight in the [[Spanish Civil War]] as part of the [[International Brigade]]. Among the leading Canadian Communists involved in that effort was Dr. [[Norman Bethune]], who is known for his invention of a mobile blood-transfusion unit, early advocacy of Medicare in Canada, and work with the [[Communist Party of China]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].\n\nSolidarity efforts for the Spanish Civil War and many labour and social struggles during the Depression resulted in much cooperation between members of the CPC and the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF). After 1935 the CPC advocated electoral alliances and unity with the CCF on key issues. The proposal was debated in the CCF, with the 1936 BC, Alberta and Saskatchewan conventions generally supporting cooperation while the Ontario convention opposed. While the motion was defeated at that Parties third federal convention, the Communists continued to call for a united front.\n\nThe call was particularly urgent in Quebec, where in 1937 the Duplessis government passed \"an act to protect Qu\u00e9bec against communist propaganda\" giving the police the power to padlock any premises used by \"communists\" (which was undefined in the legislation).\n\n=== World War II ===\n[[File:Tim Buck at Maple Leaf Gardens.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Communist Labour and Total War Committee meeting, with Tim Buck]]\n\nAlthough the Communist Party had worked hard to warn Canadians about what it considered to be a growing fascist danger, after some debate the Party saw the opening of World War II not as an anti-fascist war but a battle between capitalist nations. Most likely this conclusion was supported by the policies of the big powers. Many voices in the British establishment, for example, called loudly for support of [[Adolf Hitler]] against the USSR. Meanwhile, having failed in reaching agreement with Britain and other world powers, the USSR signed the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] with Nazi Germany, to bide time before an inevitable war between the two.\n \nThe Communist Party's opposition to [[World War II]] led to it being banned under the [[Defence of Canada Regulations]] of the [[War Measures Act]] in 1940 shortly after Canada entered into the war. In many cases Communist leaders were interned in camps, long before fascists. As growing numbers of Communist Party leaders were interned, some members went underground or exile in the United States. Conditions in the camps were harsh. A civil rights campaign was launched by the wives of many of the interned men for family visits and their release.\n\nWith Germany's [[Operation Barbarossa|1941 invasion of the USSR]] and the collapse of the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] the party argued that the nature of the war had changed to a genuine anti-fascist struggle. The CPC reversed its opposition to the war and argued the danger to the working class on the international level superseded its interests nationally.\n\nDuring the [[Conscription Crisis of 1944]], the banned CPC set up \"Tim Buck Plebiscite Committees\" across the country to campaign for a \"yes\" vote in the national referendum on [[conscription]]. Following the vote, the committees were renamed the [[Dominion Communist-Labor Total War Committee]] and urged full support for the war effort, a no-strike pledge for the duration of the war and increased industrial production. The [[National Council for Democratic Rights]] was also established with [[A.E. Smith]] as chair in order to rally for the legalization of the Communist Party and the release of Communists and anti-fascists from internment.\n\nThe party's first elected [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) was [[Dorise Nielsen]]. Nielsen was elected in North Battleford, Saskatchewan in 1940 under the [[popular front]] [[Unity (Canada)|Progressive Unity]] label, with the support of many individual CCFers. Nielsen kept her membership in the party a secret until 1943.\n\n=== Labor-Progressive Party and the Cold War ===\n{{main|Labor-Progressive Party}}\n[[File:Fred rose2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Fred Rose re-election poster]]\n\nThe Communist Party remained banned, but with the entry of the Soviet Union into the war and the eventual release of the Canadian party's interned leaders, Canadian Communists founded the Labor-Progressive Party (LPP) in 1943 as a legal front and thereafter ran candidates under that name until 1959. At its height in the mid-1940s, the party had fourteen sitting elected officials at the federal, provincial and municipal level. Several prominent elected party members were:\n* [[Dorise Nielsen]], a Saskatchewan MP elected as a [[Unity (Canada)|Unity]] candidate in 1940, declared her affiliation with the LPP when it was formed in August 1943 and ran unsuccessfully for re-election as an LPP candidate.\n* [[Fred Rose (politician)|Fred Rose]] was elected to represent a Montreal [[Electoral district (Canada)|riding]] in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] as an LPP MP, and was removed from office after being convicted of spying for the Soviet Union.\n* [[Mary Kardash]] and [[William Ross (Manitoba politician)|William Ross]] were LPP and then Communist school trustees in [[Winnipeg]]\n* [[Jacob Penner]] and [[Joseph Zuken]] were popular [[alderman|aldermen]] in Winnipeg. Zuken was an LPP school trustee before succeeding Penner on city council by which time the LPP had changed its name back to the Communist Party.\n* [[Bill Kardash]] and [[James Litterick]] were [[Manitoba]] LPP [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|Members of the Legislative Assembly]] (MLAs).\n* [[A.A. MacLeod]] and [[J.B. Salsberg]] were LPP members of the Ontario [[legislature]].\n* [[Stanley Br\u00e9haut Ryerson]], [[Sam Carr]], Charles Simms and Norman Freed were LPP [[Toronto]] aldermen while [[Stewart Smith (politician)|Stewart Smith]] was elected to the city's [[Board of Control (municipal government)|Board of Control]], Edna Ryerson, Elizabeth Morton and John Boyd were elected to the School Board in 1944.\n* [[Harry Rankin]] sat on [[Vancouver]]'s [[Vancouver City Council|city council]] on behalf of the [[Coalition of Progressive Electors|Committee of Progressive Electors]] which he helped found in the late 1960s. Though not officially a Communist Party member he was a [[fellow traveller]].\n* The small rural municipality of Clayton, Saskatchewan elected a Communist mayor to one of its tiny towns\n* [[Blairmore, Alberta]] elected a Communist majority town council and school board in 1933 and renamed the main street \"Tim Buck Avenue\" and the main park \"Karl Marx Park\"\n\nIn 1946, [[Igor Gouzenko]], a cipher clerk at the Soviet Embassy, defected to Canada alleging several Canadian communists were operating a spy ring which provided the Soviet Union with [[Classified information|top secret]] information. The [[Kellock-Taschereau Commission]] was called by Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] to investigate the matter. This led to the convictions of [[Fred Rose (politician)|Fred Rose]] and other communists.\n\n[[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s 1956 [[Secret Speech]] exposing the crimes of [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[1956 Hungarian Revolution|the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary]] shook the faith of many Communists around the world. As well, the party was riven by a crisis following the return of prominent party member [[J.B. Salsberg]] from a trip to the Soviet Union where he found rampant party-sponsored antisemitism. Salsberg reported his findings but they were rejected by the party, which suspended him from its leading bodies. The crisis resulted in the departure of the [[United Jewish Peoples' Order]], Salsberg, [[Robert Laxer]] and most of the party's Jewish members in 1956.\n\nMany, perhaps most, members of the Canadian party left, including a number of prominent party members. \nIn the mid-1960s the [[United States Department of State]] estimated the party membership to be approximately 3500.<ref>Benjamin, Roger W.; Kautsky, John H.. ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1953329 Communism and Economic Development]'', in The [[American Political Science Review]], Vol. 62, No. 1. (Mar. 1968), pp. 122.</ref> The Soviet Union's [[Prague spring|1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia]] caused more people to leave the Canadian Communist Party. Many women were likewise deterred from engaging with Canadian Communism as the Party was somewhat resistant to their politics. The Party may have countered that the discussions of sex, gender, and women's politics held the potential to veer away from the overarching goal of class revolution, for example, many radical women recalled the hypocrisy of Party men who refused to discuss sex despite carrying on numerous extramarital affairs.<ref>Beswick, Lorne. \"Reds in Beds: The Communist Party of Canada and the Politics of Reproduction, 1920-1970,\" (PhD diss., Queen's University, 2017), 269-70.</ref>\n\nThe party was also active in indigenous people's struggles. For example, [[James P. Brady]] and Malcom Norris were founders of the Metis Associations of Saskatchewan and Alberta in the 1940s and 1950s.\n\n=== Collapse of the Soviet bloc and party split ===\n[[File:William Kashtan.jpg|thumb|right|200px|William Kashtan]]\nIn common with most communist parties, it went through a crisis after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], and subsequently split. Under then general secretary George Hewison (1988\u201391), the leadership of the CPC and a segment of its general membership began to abandon Marxism\u2013Leninism as the basis of the Party's revolutionary perspective, and ultimately moved to liquidate the Party itself, seeking to replace it with a left, social democratic entity.\n\nThe protracted ideological and political crisis created much confusion and disorientation within the ranks of the Party, and paralysed both its independent and united front work for over two years. The Hewison-led majority in the Central Committee (CC) of the party voted to abandon Marxism\u2013Leninism. An orthodox minority in the CC, led by [[Miguel Figueroa]], [[Elizabeth Rowley]] and former leader [[William Kashtan]], resisted this effort. At the 28th Convention in the fall of 1990, the Hewison group managed to maintain its control of the Central Committee of the CPC, but by the spring of 1991, the membership began to turn more and more against the reformist policies and orientation of the Hewison leadership.\n\nKey provincial conventions were held in 1991 in the two main provincial bases of the CPC - British Columbia and Ontario. At the BC convention, delegates threw out Fred Wilson, one of the main leaders of the Hewison group. A few months later in June 1991, Ontario delegates rejected a concerted campaign by Hewison and his supporters, and overwhelmingly reelected provincial leader Elizabeth Rowley and other supporters of the Marxist\u2013Leninist current to the Ontario Committee and Executive.\n\nThe Hewison group moved on August 27, 1991 to expel eleven of the key leaders of the opposition, including Rowley, Emil Bjarnason, and former central organizer John Bizzell. The Hewison-controlled Central Executive also dismissed the Ontario provincial committee.\n\nThe vast majority of local clubs and committees of the CPC opposed the expulsions, and called instead for an extraordinary convention of the party to resolve the deepening crisis in a democratic manner. There were loud protests at the CC's October 1991 meeting, but an extraordinary convention was not convened. With few remaining options, Rowley and the other expelled members threatened to take the Hewison group to court. After several months of negotiations between the Hewison group and the opposition \"All-Canada Negotiating Committee\", an out-of-court settlement resulted in the Hewison leadership agreeing to leave the CPC and relinquish any claim to the party's name, while taking most of the party's assets to the Cecil-Ross Society, a publishing and educational foundation previously associated with the party.\n\nFollowing the departure of the Hewison-led group, a convention was held in December 1992 at which delegates agreed to continue the Communist Party (thus the meeting was titled the 30th CPC Convention). Delegates rejected the reformist policies instituted by the Hewison group and instead reaffirmed the CPC as a Marxist\u2013Leninist organization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://communist-party.ca/chapter-8-the-communist-party|title=Chapter 8:  THE COMMUNIST PARTY \u00bb Communist Party of Canada - Parti Communiste du Canada|work=communist-party.ca|accessdate=October 15, 2016}}</ref> Since most of the old party's assets were now the property of the Hewison-led Cecil Ross Society, the CPC convention decided to launch a new newspaper, the ''[[People's Voice (newspaper)|People's Voice]]'', to replace the old ''Canadian Tribune''. The convention elected a new central committee with Figueroa as Party Leader. The convention also amended the party constitution to grant more membership control and lessen the arbitrary powers of the CC, while maintaining democratic centralism as its organizational principle.\n\nMeanwhile, the former Communists retained the [[Cecil-Ross Society]] as a political foundation to continue their political efforts. They also sold off the party's headquarters at 24 Cecil Street, having earlier liquidated various party-related business such as Eveready Printers (the party printshop) and Progress Publishers. The name of the Cecil-Ross Society comes from the intersection of Cecil Street and Ross Street in [[Toronto]] where the headquarters of the party was located. The Cecil-Ross Society took with it the rights to the ''Canadian Tribune'', which had been the party's weekly newspaper for decades, as well as roughly half of the party's assets. The Cecil-Ross Society ended publication of the ''Canadian Tribune'' and attempted to launch a new broad-left magazine, ''New Times'' which failed after a few issues and then ''Ginger'' which was only published twice.\n\n=== The Figueroa Case ===\nThe renovated party, although with a much smaller membership and resources (such as the former headquarters at 24 Cecil Street in Toronto and party printing press) now faced further challenges and threats to its existence. New electoral laws mandated that any political party which failed to field 50 candidates in a general federal election would be automatically de-registered and its assets seized. The CPC was not in a position to run 50 candidates in the 1993 federal election (it fielded only eight candidates during that election), and therefore its assets were seized and the party was de-listed. The CPC had sought an interim injunction to prevent its imminent de-registration, but this legal action failed.\n\nA prolonged thirteen-year political and legal battle, ''[[Figueroa v. Canada]]'' ensued, which won the support of widespread popular opinion, reflected in a number of members of parliament openly supporting the challenge and other small political parties joining the case, most notably the [[Green Party of Canada|Green Party]]. Never before had a single court challenge resulted in legislative action on three separate occasions to amend a standing law. Bill C-2 (2000) amended the Canada Elections Act to (among other things) remove the unconstitutional seizure of party assets for failure to field 50 candidates in a general election and provided for the full refund of candidates' deposits. The party had its deregistration overturned and its seized assets restored. Bill C-9 (2001) reduced the threshold from 50 to 12 candidates for the party identifier to appear on the ballot. Bill C-3 (2003) scrapped the 50-candidate rule altogether for party registration. This victory was celebrated by many of the other small parties \u2013 regardless of political differences \u2013 on the principle that it was a victory for the people's right to democratic choice.\n\nDuring this time the CPC began to publish a fortnightly newspaper called ''[[People's Voice (newspaper)|People's Voice]]''. Its Quebec section, le [[Parti communiste du Qu\u00e9bec]], was reorganized. The CPC also began periodically publishing a theoretical/discussion journal ''Spark!''. In 2001 the party released its full programme. \n[[File:YCL-LJC central convention in Toronto, 2007.jpg|thumb|right|200px|YCL rebuilding convention]]\n\nThe CPC re-launched its long-standing contribution to the labour movement and support of [[trade union]] organizing and campaigns, in the civic reform movement, and in a number of social justice, anti-war and international solidarity groups and coalitions. In 2007 [[Young Communist League of Canada]] was refounded. Local YCL groups have sprung up in several centres across the country, and the League has since held two central conventions.\n\n=== Quebec communists and the national question ===\n{{main|Communist Party of Quebec}}\n\nThe Communist Party of Canada began organizing in Quebec upon its founding. Many important leaders of the CPC including [[Annie Buller]], [[William Kashtan]], [[Fred Rose (politician)|Fred Rose]], [[Madeleine Parent]], and [[L\u00e9a Roback]] hailed from Montreal, and [[Norman Bethune]] joined the party in Montreal. The Quebec district fought hard battles against the [[Duplessis]] regime, which made the party illegal using the Padlock law, and to organize the unorganized. The election of Fred Rose in [[Cartier (electoral district)|Cartier]] was a major boost to the Quebec communists and reflected the support of the CPC among working-class people in the city.\n\nFor some time the party had been struggling to develop its policy on the national question in Canada, which had changed considerably since the party's formation. As early as the 1930s the CPC recognized Quebec was a nation and by the late 1940s the party began to advocate for Quebec's right to self-determination. In the 1950s and 60s the party clarified this position, becoming the first party to advocate for a democratic solution to the national question and a new \"made-in-Canada\" constitution that would guarantee sovereignty for Quebec, up to and including separation. While supporting the right to separate, the communists opposed the succession of Quebec from Canada, proposing a new equal and voluntary partnership between what was then commonly called French and English Canada.\n\nIn the late 1950s the party finally overturned the [[padlock law]] giving new energy and hope to the party despite difficult times with the [[Khrushchev revelations]] and the continued pressure of the Cold War. Moving to better put into practice what it saw as a deeper political understanding of the national question, the CPC in Quebec re-organized as the Communist Party of Quebec in November 1965, reflecting what it now termed the [[multinational state|multi-national]] reality of Canada as \"a state with more than one nation within its borders\". The PCQ emerged as a \"distinct entity\" of the CPC, with shared membership and, at the same time, full control over its policies and administration including its own constitution.\n\nWith the [[Quiet Revolution]], [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]] and later the [[October Crisis]] the party's position on the national question became the subject of broad debate across the country, and influenced the agreement of the [[Canadian Labour Congress]] to work with the [[Quebec Federation of Labour]] on an equal and voluntary basis. The communists called for workers sympathetic with independence movements to unite on a common, immediate class-based programme of common struggle with English-speaking Canadian workers. The PCQ helped re-launch Montreal's mass May Day demonstrations and advanced many unique policies including the idea of a federated party of labour, which proved its prescience with the formation of [[Qu\u00e9bec solidaire]]. The federated party of labour proposal was endorsed by the late 1960s by most trade union centrals, but the project was eclipsed by the emergence of the [[Parti Quebecois]].\n\nBy the 1980s the CPC and PCQ were calling for \"a new, democratic constitutional arrangement based on the equal and voluntary union of Aboriginal peoples, Qu\u00e9bec, and English-speaking Canada\" replacing the Senate with a house of nations. In this context the PCQ and CPC critically supported the first referendum question on sovereignty association, while later the CPC advocated voting No on the second referendum in 1995.\n\nDuring the crisis in CPC during the 1990s, the PCQ became disorganized, closed its offices, and its remaining members drifted apart from the CPC, with many in the leadership adopting positions sympathetic to nationalism. It was not until 1997 that a range of communists and communist groups came together to re-organize the PCQ. A few years later the party helped bring together different tendencies in the left to form the [[Union des forces progressistes (Canada)|Union of Progressive Forces]] (UFP) which became [[Qu\u00e9bec solidaire]].\n\nThe UFP agreed to place the question of Quebec independence as secondary to social or class issues. This was hotly debated as the party transformed into [[Qu\u00e9bec solidaire]]. The debate moved over into the PCQ as well. These positions were questioned by the Quebec leader of the party, Andr\u00e9 Parizeau, who formulated a series of amendments in support of immediate independence in 2004 which were rejected by both the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the Quebec party (by a vote of 4-2) and by the Central Executive Committee of the Canadian party (by a vote of 7-1).\n\nIn January 2005, Parizeau wrote a letter to PCQ members declaring that the party was in crisis and, describing the four NEC members who opposed his amendments as a pro-federalist \"Gang of Four\", he summarily dismissed them. Although his Quebec nationalist point of view held a slim majority at the PCQ's convention of April 2005, the delegate selection process was highly disputed. Parizeau was subsequently expelled by the Central Committee of the CPC for factionalism and actions harmful to the Party. Around the same time, his group announced their withdrawal from the CPC. The CPC then began to re-organize the PCQ-PCC in Quebec, but the Quebec provincial government authorities continued to recognize Parizeau as holding the electoral registration of the [[Parti communiste du Qu\u00e9bec]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electionsquebec.qc.ca/fr/ppc_liste_partis_candidats.asp?sect=prov&parti=PCQ#texteP|title=- Le Directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des \u00e9lections du Qu\u00e9bec (DGEQ)|work=electionsquebec.qc.ca|accessdate=October 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Central Committee of the party affirmed the authority of the previous Quebec National Executive Committee in June 18\u201319, 2005. The non-registered CPC-aligned PCQ held a new convention which restarted a communist French-language periodical, Clart\u00e9, and later opened an office and small reading room, launched an active website, and re-affiliated with Quebec Solidaire as an organized group. They work closely with the youth and student organization, the \"Ligue de la jeunesse communiste du Quebec\". The CPC's account of this situation is available online,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.communist-party.ca/news/Statements/2005/cpc_pcq_en.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051004191411/http://www.communist-party.ca/news/Statements/2005/cpc_pcq_en.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 4, 2005|title=May Day Statement 2005|date=October 4, 2005|accessdate=October 3, 2017}}</ref> as is the letter from Parizeau's PCQ group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcq.qc.ca/English/OtherPCQ.htm|title=\u00c0 propos de \"l'autre PCQ\"|work=pcq.qc.ca|accessdate=October 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe CPC-aligned PCQ campaigned for a general social (political) strike against the previous Charest Liberal government and the subsequent pro-austerity provincial governments. In 2015 the Parizeau group officially left Quebec Solidaire to support the Parti Quebecois and the campaign of [[Pierre Karl P\u00e9ladeau]].\n\n== 37th and 38th Central Conventions ==\nThe CPC held its 37th Central Convention in February 2013 in Toronto. According to a ''Toronto Star'' article the assembly drew 65 delegates most of whom were from Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec with a few from Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Nova Scotia. Party leader Miguel Figueroa called for the Communists to field 25 candidates in the upcoming federal election.\n\nThe CPC held its 38th Central Convention in May 2016, again in Toronto. The meeting drew about 70-80 delegates from Ontario, British Columbia, Quebec, Manitoba, Alberta, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and New Brunswick, in order of delegation size.  The party held a special tribute to Miguel Figueroa, who had retired before the convention, and elected Elizabeth Rowley as party leader.\n\n== Allied organizations ==\nHistorically, the Communist Party and Labor-Progressive Party have had allied organizations which were affiliated with the party until the late-1920s, and subsequently understood to be largely following the Party's direction. These groups often originated from left wing labour and socialist movements that existed prior to the creation of the Communist Party and operated political and cultural activities amongst various immigrant groups, published magazines and operated their own cultural centres and meeting halls. From the 1920s through the 1950s the largest immigrant groups represented in the party were Finns, Ukrainians and Jews who were organized in the [[Finnish Organization of Canada]] (founded in 1911 as the Finnish Socialist Organization of Canada), the [[Association of United Ukrainian Canadians]] (known as the Ukrainian Labor Farmer Temple Association until 1946) and the [[United Jewish Peoples' Order]] (known as the Labour League until 1945) respectively.\n\nAlso active in the 1930s and 1940s were the [[Hungarian Workers Clubs]], the [[Polish People's Association]] (formerly the Polish Workers' and Farmers' Association), the [[Serbian People's Movement]] and [[Croatian Cultural Association]] (formerly the Jugoslav Workers' Clubs) and the [[Carpatho-Russian Society]]. The [[Russian Farmer-Worker Clubs]] were formed in the early 1930s but closed by the government under the [[Defence of Canada Regulations]] at the outbreak of [[World War II]]. When the Soviet Union became Canada's ally in 1942, they re-appeared as the [[Federation of Russian Canadians]]. The [[Canadian Slav Committee]] was formed in 1948 in an attempt to put party-aligned cultural associations for Ukrainians, Russians, Poles, Slovaks, Bulgarians, Macedonians, Yugoslavs and Carpatho-Rusyns under one umbrella.\n\nThe Society of Capartho-Russian Canadians re-formed and, in 1950, acquired a hall at 280 Queen Street West in Toronto which it continues to operate into the twenty-first century.<ref>https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2019/01/05/the-golden-girls-of-prospect-cemetery.html</ref>\n\nThe UJPO broke with the party in 1956 during the period of the \"Khrushchev revelations\" and allegations of antisemitism in the Soviet Union.\n\nLater allied organizations include the [[Greek Canadian Democratic Organization]] formed by leftists emigres who had fled the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974]] and the [[Portuguese Canadian Democratic Association]] which was formed by left-wing emigres who had left Portugal in the 1960s and early 1970s when it was still ruled by a right wing dictatorship.

From 1943 until 1959 they ran candidates under the name [[Labor-Progressive Party]].\n\n<sup>3</sup>: In 1972, a new ''Elections Act'' came into effect which required a party to run at least 50 candidates in order to be considered an official party. The Communist Party failed to reach that threshold and so its 32 candidates were officially considered to be independents.\n\n<sup>4</sup>: The party failed to register at least 50 candidates in time for the 1993 election. As a result, the party was deregistered and its candidates ran as independents. Party status was not regained until prior to the 2000 general election. It is unknown how many party members ran in the 1993 and 1997 elections as independents.\n\n== Provincial sections ==\nThe Communist Party of Canada has provincial wings which contest general elections at the provincial level.

He served as both Minister of the Navy and [[Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] and was a recipient of the [[Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus]]. In his naval career, he was best known for his actions during the [[Italian Wars of Independence]] and later as commander of the [[International Squadron (Crete intervention, 1897\u20131898)|International Squadron]] off [[Crete]] in 1897\u20131898.\n\n==Biography==\nThe descendant of a [[Liguria]]n family originally from [[Zoagli]], Canevaro was born in [[Lima]], [[Peru]], to Giuseppe and Francesca Velaga.<ref name=treccani>{{cite web |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/felice-napoleone-canevaro_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ |first=Gabriele  |last=Mariano |title=Canevaro, Felice Napoleone |work=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani  |volume=18 |year=1975 |language=Italian}}</ref>\n\n===Naval career===\nIn 1852, Canevaro was admitted to the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]'s Royal Navy School at [[Genoa]], completing the course of instruction in 1855 and receiving a [[Commissioned officer|commission]] as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign second class]].\n\n====Italian Wars of Independence====\nIn 1859, with the rank of second [[Lieutenant (naval)|lieutenant]], Canevaro took part in [[Royal Sardinian Navy]] operations in the [[Adriatic Sea]] aboard the [[Troop transport|transport]] ''Beroldo'' and the sailing [[frigate]] {{ship|Italian frigate|Des Geneys||2}} during the [[Second Italian War of Independence]].<ref name=treccani/>\n\nIn 1860, Canevaro arrived in [[Palermo]], [[Sicily]], aboard {{ship|Italian frigate|Maria Adelaide||2}}, the [[flagship]] of the Sardinian [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]]. When the supporters of the Italian nationalist leader [[General officer|General]] [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] organized their navy, he resigned from the Royal Sardinian Navy to enlist in the Garibaldian navy. Aboard the [[steam frigate]] ''Tukory'' on the night of 13 August 1860, Canevaro distinguished himself during an unsuccessful attempt to board the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] steam [[ship-of-the-line]] ''Monarca'' while she was anchored in the port of [[Castellammare di Stabia]]. He received the [[Silver Medal of Military Valor]] for his actions during this engagement.<ref name=treccani/>\n\nIn the autumn of 1860, Canevarro was reinstated in the Royal Sardinian Navy. While embarked on the Sardinian steam frigate {{ship|Italian frigate|Carlo Alberto|1853|2}} from December 1860 to March 1861, he took part in the [[Siege of Gaeta (1860)|Siege of Gaeta]] and a [[siege]] of [[Messina]] during operations in which ''Carlo Alberto'' repeatedly exchanged fire with hostile forces at close range along the coast. After the campaign, he was made a Knight of the [[Military Order of Savoy]], and in 1863, he was promoted to ''[[Lieutenant (naval)|luogotenente de vascello]]''. In 1865\u20131866, Canevaro was on board the steam frigate {{ship|Italian frigate|Principe Umberto||2}}, under the command [[Guglielmo Acton]], during a long cruise that included a [[transatlantic voyage]], operations along the [[Atlantic]] coast of [[South America]], a transit of the [[Strait of Magellan]] into the [[Pacific Ocean]], and steaming up the coast of [[Chile]].<ref name=treccani/>\n[[File:Italian battleship Italia officers and guns.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Canevaro and the [[Commissioned officer|officers]] of the [[battleship]] {{ship|Italian ironclad|Italia||2}} pose under a pair of her {{convert|17|in|mm|adj=on|0}} guns.]]\nOn returning to Italy, he was assigned to the [[broadside ironclad]] {{ship|Italian ironclad|Re di Portogallo||2}}, commanded by Augusto Riboty.

From January 1877 to March 1879, while in command of the [[cruiser]] {{ship|Italian cruiser|Colombo||2}}, he circumnavigated the globe, departing Italy, transiting the [[Suez Canal]], skirting [[Asia]], visiting ports in [[China]] and the [[Netherlands East Indies]] \u2013 where ''Colombo'' recovered the body of the Italian general and politician [[Nino Bixio]], who had died of [[cholera]] in [[Banda Aceh]] on [[Sumatra]] in 1873 \u2013 and then went on to [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], [[Russia]] (including [[Siberia]]), [[Australia]] and the [[Americas]].

Canevaro \u2013 who relieved the commander of the Italian naval squadron, Rear Admiral Gualterio, who had previously been in command of the 2nd Naval Division \u2013 assumed command of the [[International Squadron (Cretan intervention, 1897\u20131898)|International Squadron]] of warships off Crete on 16 or 17 February 1897 (sources differ) as the most senior admiral present, and took up duties as president of the \"Admirals Council,\" which consisted of the senior admirals present off Crete of each of the six countries participating in the International Squadron.<ref name=treccani/><ref name=nyt180297>{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1897/02/18/102485379.pdf |title=The Powers Take Action; Sharp Warning Issued to Prince George Against Hostilities |work=The New York Times |date=18 February 1897}}</ref> The squadron put landing detachments ashore, but Christian insurgents continued to attack Ottoman forces and Canevaro soon ordered International Squadron ships to bombard them during February and March 1897 to stop the fighting. Although some political opponents in the Italian legislature attacked him for ordering the International Squadron to bombard the insurgents, Canevaro received great credit during his time in command of the squadron for his ability to exercise diplomacy and mediate disputes between the six Great Powers \u2013 [[Austria-Hungary]], [[France]], the [[German Empire]], Italy, the [[Russian Empire]], and the [[United Kingdom]] \u2013 making up the squadron and for the way in which he dealt with the confusing and anarchic situation on Crete, balancing humanitarian compassion and a spirit of conciliation in his dealings with Greek, Christian insurgent, and Ottoman forces on the island with the occasional need to use force to halt fighting and quell disturbances. Before leaving the International Squadron in 1898, Canevaro negotiated an agreement under which all combat on Crete would cease and [[Greece]] and the Ottoman Empire would withdraw their forces from the island in anticipation of the creation of an autonomous [[Cretan State]] under the [[suzerainty]] of the [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman sultan]].<ref name=treccani/> Such was his reputation that when the creation of an office of [[High commissioner|High Commissioner]] of the Cretan State was proposed in the spring of 1898, Canevaro received an invitation to become the first high commissioner, but he declined the offer, and instead [[Prince George of Greece and Denmark]] became the first high commissioner when the Cretan State finally came into existence in December 1898.<ref name=treccani/>\n\n===Government minister===\n\nWhen [[Prime Minister of Italy]] [[Antonio Starabba, Marchese di Rudin\u00ec]], formed the government for his fifth ministry, Canevaro turned over command of the International Squadron to its next-most-senior admiral, Rear Admiral [[\u00c9douard Pottier]] of the [[French Navy]], and returned to Italy to serve as di Rudini\u2032s [[Italian Minister of the Navy|Minister of the Navy]]. Taking office on 1 June 1898, he served only four weeks, until the di Rudini government was replaced on 29 June 1898 by that of Prime Minister [[General officer|General]] [[Luigi Pelloux]]. On the same day Pelloux took office, Canevaro changed portfolios to become the [[Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs]].<ref name=treccani/> In his new role, he attempted to continue Italy\u2032s policy of loyalty to the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] with Austria-Hungary and the German Empire and of continued warm relations with the United Kingdom, but at the same time worked toward relaxing tensions with France, and he conducted secret negotiations with the French for a commercial treaty, which the countries signed on 26 November 1898. He also resisted pressure from Germany to change the status of the Cretan State, supporting its continuation as an autonomous state under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=treccani/>\n\nHowever, despite his successes in negotiations on Crete while in command of the International Squadron, Canevaro's talent for leading military forces did not translate into success in international diplomacy when it came to larger issues. During the [[Fashoda Crisis]] of 1899 between France and the United Kingdom, Canevaro conducted intensive diplomacy as part of the ongoing European \"[[Scramble for Africa]]\" in an effort to gain French and British recognition of an Italian interest in [[Libya]], but when the French and British concluded an agreement on 21 March 1899 that resolved the crisis, they offered no such recognition. Canevaro also was unsuccessful when in the wake of a number of anarchist attacks in [[Europe]] \u2013 one of which resulted in the stabbing death of [[Empress of Austria]] and [[Queen of Hungary]] [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria|Elizabeth]] on 10 September 1898 \u2013 he proposed an international anti-anarchist conference of diplomats and government security and judicial officials to address the situation; although some countries agreed to participate, the conference never took place.<ref name=treccani/>\n\nA final blow to Canevaro's diplomatic career came in the \"San Mun Affair\" of 1899, in which Italy demanded that the [[Chinese Empire]] grant it a lease for a naval coaling station at [[China]]'s [[Sanmen Bay]] (known as \"San-Mun Bay\" to the Italians) similar to the lease the German Empire had secured in 1898 at [[Kiautschou Bay concession|Kiaochow Bay]]. From Sanmen Bay, Italy hoped to establish an area of influence in [[Chekiang]]. The Russian Empire and the [[United States]] opposed the Italian demand, but the Italian ambassador in China, [[Renato De Martino]], led Canevaro to believe that the area was ripe for the taking. The British government, although ambivalent toward the Italian move, gave its approval as long as Italy did not use force against the Chinese, but the British did not inform Canevaro that the United Kingdom\u2032s representatives in China had advised that Italy could not achieve its goals without using force. Believing the opportunity to pursue Italy's interests in China was at hand, Canevaro had de Martino pass Italy\u2032s demands to the Chinese imperial government in the winter of 1899, but the Chinese summarily rejected them on 4 March 1899. On 8 March, Canevaro instructed De Martino to present the demands again as an ultimatum and authorized the [[armored cruiser]] ''[[Italian cruiser Marco Polo|Marco Polo]]'' and [[protected cruiser]] ''[[Italian cruiser Elba|Elba]]'' to occupy the bay. When the British ambassador in [[Rome]] reminded him that the United Kingdom did not support an Italian use of force, Canevaro issued a counterorder cancelling his authorization to use the two [[cruiser]]s in the bay, but De Martino received the counterorder before he received the original authorization to employ the ships. Unable to decipher the counterorder, De Martino presented the Italian ultimatum to China again on 10 March 1899, and China immediately refused to comply. Italy withdrew its ultimatum, becoming at the end of the 19th century the first and only [[Western world|Western]] power to fail to achieve its territorial goals in China.

On 14 March 1899, Canevaro attempted to present the affair to the [[Parliament of the Kingdom of Italy|Italian Parliament]] in a positive light, saying that be believed that China had rejected the Italian ultimatum in order to maintain a positive and productive relationship with Italy uninterrupted by negotiations over the bay, but such was the domestic criticism of the Italian failure as a humiliation and international criticism of it as a needless and unjustified provocation that Pelloux announced the resignation of his entire cabinet on 14 May 1899.

After the campaign, he was made a Knight of the [[Military Order of Savoy]], and in 1863, he was promoted to ''[[Lieutenant (naval)|luogotenente de vascello]]''.

Although some political opponents in the Italian legislature attacked him for ordering the International Squadron to bombard the insurgents, Canevaro received great credit during his time in command of the squadron for his ability to exercise diplomacy and mediate disputes between the six Great Powers \u2013 [[Austria-Hungary]], [[France]], the [[German Empire]], Italy, the [[Russian Empire]], and the [[United Kingdom]] \u2013 making up the squadron and for the way in which he dealt with the confusing and anarchic situation on Crete, balancing humanitarian compassion and a spirit of conciliation in his dealings with Greek, Christian insurgent, and Ottoman forces on the island with the occasional need to use force to halt fighting and quell disturbances. Before leaving the International Squadron in 1898, Canevaro negotiated an agreement under which all combat on Crete would cease and [[Greece]] and the Ottoman Empire would withdraw their forces from the island in anticipation of the creation of an autonomous [[Cretan State]] under the [[suzerainty]] of the [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman sultan]].<ref name=treccani/> Such was his reputation that when the creation of an office of [[High commissioner|High Commissioner]] of the Cretan State was proposed in the spring of 1898, Canevaro received an invitation to become the first high commissioner, but he declined the offer, and instead [[Prince George of Greece and Denmark]] became the first high commissioner when the Cretan State finally came into existence in December 1898.<ref name=treccani/>\n\n===Government minister===\n\nWhen [[Prime Minister of Italy]] [[Antonio Starabba, Marchese di Rudin\u00ec]], formed the government for his fifth ministry, Canevaro turned over command of the International Squadron to its next-most-senior admiral, Rear Admiral [[\u00c9douard Pottier]] of the [[French Navy]], and returned to Italy to serve as di Rudini\u2032s [[Italian Minister of the Navy|Minister of the Navy]]. Taking office on 1 June 1898, he served only four weeks, until the di Rudini government was replaced on 29 June 1898 by that of Prime Minister [[General officer|General]] [[Luigi Pelloux]]. On the same day Pelloux took office, Canevaro changed portfolios to become the [[Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs]].<ref name=treccani/> In his new role, he attempted to continue Italy\u2032s policy of loyalty to the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] with Austria-Hungary and the German Empire and of continued warm relations with the United Kingdom, but at the same time worked toward relaxing tensions with France, and he conducted secret negotiations with the French for a commercial treaty, which the countries signed on 26 November 1898. He also resisted pressure from Germany to change the status of the Cretan State, supporting its continuation as an autonomous state under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=treccani/>\n\nHowever, despite his successes in negotiations on Crete while in command of the International Squadron, Canevaro's talent for leading military forces did not translate into success in international diplomacy when it came to larger issues. During the [[Fashoda Crisis]] of 1899 between France and the United Kingdom, Canevaro conducted intensive diplomacy as part of the ongoing European \"[[Scramble for Africa]]\" in an effort to gain French and British recognition of an Italian interest in [[Libya]], but when the French and British concluded an agreement on 21 March 1899 that resolved the crisis, they offered no such recognition. Canevaro also was unsuccessful when in the wake of a number of anarchist attacks in [[Europe]] \u2013 one of which resulted in the stabbing death of [[Empress of Austria]] and [[Queen of Hungary]] [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria|Elizabeth]] on 10 September 1898 \u2013 he proposed an international anti-anarchist conference of diplomats and government security and judicial officials to address the situation; although some countries agreed to participate, the conference never took place.<ref name=treccani/>\n\nA final blow to Canevaro's diplomatic career came in the \"San Mun Affair\" of 1899, in which Italy demanded that the [[Chinese Empire]] grant it a lease for a naval coaling station at [[China]]'s [[Sanmen Bay]] (known as \"San-Mun Bay\" to the Italians) similar to the lease the German Empire had secured in 1898 at [[Kiautschou Bay concession|Kiaochow Bay]]. From Sanmen Bay, Italy hoped to establish an area of influence in [[Chekiang]]. The Russian Empire and the [[United States]] opposed the Italian demand, but the Italian ambassador in China, [[Renato De Martino]], led Canevaro to believe that the area was ripe for the taking. The British government, although ambivalent toward the Italian move, gave its approval as long as Italy did not use force against the Chinese, but the British did not inform Canevaro that the United Kingdom\u2032s representatives in China had advised that Italy could not achieve its goals without using force. Believing the opportunity to pursue Italy's interests in China was at hand, Canevaro had de Martino pass Italy\u2032s demands to the Chinese imperial government in the winter of 1899, but the Chinese summarily rejected them on 4 March 1899. On 8 March, Canevaro instructed De Martino to present the demands again as an ultimatum and authorized the [[armored cruiser]] ''[[Italian cruiser Marco Polo|Marco Polo]]'' and [[protected cruiser]] ''[[Italian cruiser Elba|Elba]]'' to occupy the bay. When the British ambassador in [[Rome]] reminded him that the United Kingdom did not support an Italian use of force, Canevaro issued a counterorder cancelling his authorization to use the two [[cruiser]]s in the bay, but De Martino received the counterorder before he received the original authorization to employ the ships. Unable to decipher the counterorder, De Martino presented the Italian ultimatum to China again on 10 March 1899, and China immediately refused to comply. Italy withdrew its ultimatum, becoming at the end of the 19th century the first and only [[Western world|Western]] power to fail to achieve its territorial goals in China. The fiasco was an embarrassment that gave Italy \u2013 still stung by its defeat at the hands of the [[Ethiopian Empire]] in the [[Battle of Adwa|Battle of Adowa]] in 1896 \u2013 the appearance of a third-rate power. On 14 March 1899, Canevaro attempted to present the affair to the [[Parliament of the Kingdom of Italy|Italian Parliament]] in a positive light, saying that be believed that China had rejected the Italian ultimatum in order to maintain a positive and productive relationship with Italy uninterrupted by negotiations over the bay, but such was the domestic criticism of the Italian failure as a humiliation and international criticism of it as a needless and unjustified provocation that Pelloux announced the resignation of his entire cabinet on 14 May 1899. He excluded Canevaro from the new cabinet he established that day.<ref name=treccani/><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DUUCp8YQc5kC&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8&dq=felice+napoleone+canevaro&source=bl&ots=00aY0ghOzd&sig=zzNPUpZ6p3LihTwtNRWGAHd-FX0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiJ2fygxLLYAhUE2mMKHaCSA9I4ChDoAQg3MAM#v=onepage&q=de%20martino&f=false |last=Smith |first=Shirley Ann |title=Imperial Designs: Italians in China, 1900\u20131947 |location=Madison, New Jersey |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-61147-502-9 |pages=8\u201310}}</ref>\n\n===Later naval service===\n\nCanevaro returned to the navy, commanding the 3rd Maritime District from 16 July 1900 to 16 January 1902 and presiding over the [[Supreme Council of the Navy]] from 16 January 1902 until 6 July 1903.
