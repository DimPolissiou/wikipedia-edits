Jagger sings in first person narrative as the [[Devil]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} boasting his role in each of several historical atrocities.  The singer then ironically demands our courtesy towards him, implicitly chastising the listener for our collective culpability in the listed killings and crimes.  In the 2012 documentary ''[[Crossfire Hurricane]]'', Jagger stated that his influence for the song came from [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]] and from the Russian author [[Mikhail Bulgakov]]'s novel ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'' (which had just appeared in English translation in 1967). The book was given to him by [[Marianne Faithfull]].\n\nIn a 1995 interview with ''Rolling Stone'', Jagger said, \"I think that was taken from an old idea of [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]]'s, I think, but I could be wrong. Sometimes when I look at my Baudelaire books, I can't see it in there. But it was an idea I got from French writing. And I just took a couple of lines and expanded on it.

The song was originally written with the line \"I shouted out 'Who killed [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]]?'\" After [[Robert F. Kennedy]]'s [[Assassination of Robert F.

[[Marianne Faithfull]], [[Anita Pallenberg]], [[Brian Jones]], [[Charlie Watts]], producer [[Jimmy Miller]], Wyman and Richards performed backup vocals, singing the \"woo woos\".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}  Richards plays bass on the original recording, {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} and also electric guitar. Brian Jones plays a mostly mixed out acoustic guitar, although in isolated tracks of the studio cut, it is audible playing along with the piano.\n\nIn the 2003 book ''According to the Rolling Stones'', Watts commented:\n\n{{quote|\"Sympathy\" was one of those sort of songs where we tried everything.  The first time I ever heard the song was when Mick was playing it at the front door of a house I lived at in Sussex{{nbsp}}... He played it entirely on his own{{nbsp}}... and it was fantastic. We had a go at loads of different ways of playing it; in the end I just played a jazz Latin feel in the style of [[Kenny Clarke]] would have played on \"[[A Night in Tunisia]]\" \u2013 not the actual rhythm he played, but the same styling.<ref name=\"accordingtop119\" />}}\n\nOn the overall power of the song, Jagger continued in ''Rolling Stone'':\n\n{{quote|It has a very hypnotic groove, a samba, which has a tremendous hypnotic power, rather like good dance music. It doesn't speed up or slow down. It keeps this constant groove. Plus, the actual samba rhythm is a great one to sing on, but it is also got some other suggestions in it, an undercurrent of being primitive\u2014because it is a primitive African, South American, Afro-whatever-you-call-that rhythm ([[candombl\u00e9]]).  So to white people, it has a very sinister thing about it. But forgetting the cultural colors, it is a very good vehicle for producing a powerful piece. It becomes less pretentious because it is a very unpretentious groove. If it had been done as a ballad, it wouldn't have been as good.<ref name=\"wenner95\" />}}\n\nThe backing \"who who-woo-woo' vocals, which helped to make the song's sound stand out, came about by accident thanks to [[Jimmy Miller]] and [[Anita Pallenberg]]. Pallenberg was in the engineering booth with Miller while Jagger was belting out an early vocal take of the song. According to Pallenberg, Miller was half talking to himself as Jagger sang, saying stuff like \"Come on Mick, give it your all, who are you singing about? - Who, who?\" He then repeated \"Who who\" several times after that as Jagger sang on, and Pallenberg realized how wonderful that all sounded. After the take, she told Jagger what transpired in the booth and suggested that \"who who\" be used in the song as a backing vocal chant. The Stones then gave it a go and after the first take, 'Who who\" became \"woo-woo\", with most of this caught on film by director [[Jean-Luc Godard]] for his ''[[Sympathy for the Devil (1968 film)|One Plus One]]'' (aka ''Sympathy for the Devil'') movie.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\nIn an interview with ''[[Creem]]'', Jagger said, \"[When people started taking us as devil worshippers], I thought it was a really odd thing, because it was only one song, after all. It wasn't like it was a whole album, with lots of occult signs on the back. People seemed to embrace the image so readily, [and] it has carried all the way over into heavy metal bands today. Some people have made a living out of doing this; for example, [[Jimmy Page]].\"<ref name=salon />\n\nOf the change in public perception the band experienced after the song's release, Richards said in a 1971 interview with ''Rolling Stone'', \"Before, we were just innocent kids out for a good time, they're saying, 'They're evil, they're evil.' Oh, I'm evil, really? So that makes you start thinking about evil ... What is evil? Half of it, I don't know how many people think of Mick as the devil or as just a good rock performer or what?

The song was also used in the 1998 film ''[[Fallen (1998 film)|Fallen]]''.\n\nIn 2015, the song was used in the ''[[Focus (2015 film)#Soundtrack|Focus]]'' and appeared on Track #7 of the soundtrack.\n\nIt also appeared in an episode of ''The Black List'' to describe Red Reddington\n\n== The 1968 film and others ==\n[[File:Rolling Stones Sympathy for the Devil.jpg|thumb|left|Cover art for DVD release]]\n''Sympathy for the Devil'' is also the title of [[Sympathy for the Devil (1968 film)|a producer's edit of a 1968 film]] by [[Jean-Luc Godard]] whose own original version is called ''One Plus One''.  The film, a depiction of the late 1960s American counterculture, also featured the Rolling Stones in the process of recording the song in the studio. On the filming, Jagger said in ''Rolling Stone'': \"[it was] very fortuitous, because Godard wanted to do a film of us in the studio. I mean, it would never happen now, to get someone as interesting as Godard. And stuffy. We just happened to be recording that song. We could have been recording 'My Obsession.' But it was 'Sympathy for the Devil', and it became the track that we used.\"<ref name=\"wenner95\" />\n\nDuring the several days of recording the Stones as they played, a film lamp set up by Godard's crew, started a major fire in the studio that caused substantial damage to the studio and laid waste to some of the band\u2019s equipment. However, the song's tapes were saved by producer [[Jimmy Miller]] before he fled the studio, and Godard kept his cameras rolling capturing the fire on film as it roared on.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Guns N' Roses version ==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Sympathy for the Devil\n| cover      = Gnr sympathy.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Guns N' Roses]]\n| album      = [[Interview with the Vampire (soundtrack)|Interview with the Vampire soundtrack]]\n| B-side     = \"Escape to Paris\" (by Elliot Goldenthal)\n| released   = {{Start date|1994|12|13|df=y}}\n| recorded   = October 1994\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Hard rock]]\n| length     = {{Duration|m=7|s=36}}\n| label      = [[Geffen Records|Geffen]]\n| writer     = [[Jagger/Richards]]\n| producer   =\n*Guns N' Roses\n*[[Mike Clink]]\n*[[Matthias Gohl]]\n| prev_title = [[Since I Don't Have You#Guns N' Roses version|Since I Don't Have You]]\n| prev_year  = 1994\n| next_title = [[Chinese Democracy (song)|Chinese Democracy]]\n| next_year  = 2008\n}}\n\n[[Guns N' Roses]] recorded a cover in 1994 which reached number 55 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]; it was featured in the closing credits of [[Neil Jordan]]'s film adaptation of [[Anne Rice]]'s ''[[Interview with the Vampire (film)|Interview with the Vampire]]'' (except the 4K cut of the film) and was included on their ''[[Greatest Hits (Guns N' Roses album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album.

Jagger sings in first person narrative as the [[Devil]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} boasting his role in each of several historical atrocities.

The book was given to him by [[Marianne Faithfull]].\n\nIn a 1995 interview with ''Rolling Stone'', Jagger said, \"I think that was taken from an old idea of [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]]'s, I think, but I could be wrong.

[[Marianne Faithfull]], [[Anita Pallenberg]], [[Brian Jones]], [[Charlie Watts]], producer [[Jimmy Miller]], Wyman and Richards performed backup vocals, singing the \"woo woos\".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}  Richards plays bass on the original recording, {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} and also electric guitar. Brian Jones plays a mostly mixed out acoustic guitar, although in isolated tracks of the studio cut, it is audible playing along with the piano.\n\nIn the 2003 book ''According to the Rolling Stones'', Watts commented:\n\n{{quote|\"Sympathy\" was one of those sort of songs where we tried everything.  The first time I ever heard the song was when Mick was playing it at the front door of a house I lived at in Sussex{{nbsp}}... He played it entirely on his own{{nbsp}}... and it was fantastic. We had a go at loads of different ways of playing it; in the end I just played a jazz Latin feel in the style of [[Kenny Clarke]] would have played on \"[[A Night in Tunisia]]\" \u2013 not the actual rhythm he played, but the same styling.<ref name=\"accordingtop119\" />}}\n\nOn the overall power of the song, Jagger continued in ''Rolling Stone'':\n\n{{quote|It has a very hypnotic groove, a samba, which has a tremendous hypnotic power, rather like good dance music. It doesn't speed up or slow down. It keeps this constant groove. Plus, the actual samba rhythm is a great one to sing on, but it is also got some other suggestions in it, an undercurrent of being primitive\u2014because it is a primitive African, South American, Afro-whatever-you-call-that rhythm ([[candombl\u00e9]]).  So to white people, it has a very sinister thing about it. But forgetting the cultural colors, it is a very good vehicle for producing a powerful piece. It becomes less pretentious because it is a very unpretentious groove. If it had been done as a ballad, it wouldn't have been as good.<ref name=\"wenner95\" />}}\n\nThe backing \"who who-woo-woo' vocals, which helped to make the song's sound stand out, came about by accident thanks to [[Jimmy Miller]] and [[Anita Pallenberg]]. Pallenberg was in the engineering booth with Miller while Jagger was belting out an early vocal take of the song. According to Pallenberg, Miller was half talking to himself as Jagger sang, saying stuff like \"Come on Mick, give it your all, who are you singing about? - Who, who?\" He then repeated \"Who who\" several times after that as Jagger sang on, and Pallenberg realized how wonderful that all sounded. After the take, she told Jagger what transpired in the booth and suggested that \"who who\" be used in the song as a backing vocal chant. The Stones then gave it a go and after the first take, 'Who who\" became \"woo-woo\", with most of this caught on film by director [[Jean-Luc Godard]] for his ''[[Sympathy for the Devil (1968 film)|One Plus One]]'' (aka ''Sympathy for the Devil'') movie.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\nIn an interview with ''[[Creem]]'', Jagger said, \"[When people started taking us as devil worshippers], I thought it was a really odd thing, because it was only one song, after all. It wasn't like it was a whole album, with lots of occult signs on the back. People seemed to embrace the image so readily, [and] it has carried all the way over into heavy metal bands today. Some people have made a living out of doing this; for example, [[Jimmy Page]].\"<ref name=salon />\n\nOf the change in public perception the band experienced after the song's release, Richards said in a 1971 interview with ''Rolling Stone'', \"Before, we were just innocent kids out for a good time, they're saying, 'They're evil, they're evil.' Oh, I'm evil, really? So that makes you start thinking about evil ... What is evil? Half of it, I don't know how many people think of Mick as the devil or as just a good rock performer or what? There are black magicians who think we are acting as unknown agents of Lucifer and others who think we are Lucifer.

However, in Thompson\u2019s [[autobiography]] [[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]], that fact was never mentioned.

The [[Fatboy Slim]] remix was featured in the music video game ''[[Just Dance 2]]''. The song also appears in the 2016 [[DC Comics]] superhero film ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]''. It plays when the character of [[Amanda Waller]] (played by [[Viola Davis]]) is first introduced.  \n\nIn the [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] graphic novel ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' by [[Alan Moore]] and [[David Lloyd (comics)|David Lloyd]], the character \"[[V (V for Vendetta)|V]]\" quotes the opening lyrics to the song as he confronts a paedophile bishop who is later murdered by him.\n\nThe title of the first episode of season 5 of the [[The CW|CW]] series ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'' is named after the song, but the song does not actually play in the episode. Similarly, the song's name serves as the title for the sixth episode, or \"session\" of the [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]] anime television series ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'', though the song itself does not play in the episode.\n\nIn 1990, the song was used in the Season Two episode of the TV series ''[[Midnight Caller]]'' entitled \"Nighthawk's Got the Blues\". The song was also used in the 1998 film ''[[Fallen (1998 film)|Fallen]]''.\n\nIn 2015, the song was used in the ''[[Focus (2015 film)#Soundtrack|Focus]]'' and appeared on Track #7 of the soundtrack.\n\nIt also appeared in an episode of ''The Black List'' to describe Red Reddington\n\n== The 1968 film and others ==\n[[File:Rolling Stones Sympathy for the Devil.jpg|thumb|left|Cover art for DVD release]]\n''Sympathy for the Devil'' is also the title of [[Sympathy for the Devil (1968 film)|a producer's edit of a 1968 film]] by [[Jean-Luc Godard]] whose own original version is called ''One Plus One''.  The film, a depiction of the late 1960s American counterculture, also featured the Rolling Stones in the process of recording the song in the studio. On the filming, Jagger said in ''Rolling Stone'': \"[it was] very fortuitous, because Godard wanted to do a film of us in the studio. I mean, it would never happen now, to get someone as interesting as Godard. And stuffy. We just happened to be recording that song. We could have been recording 'My Obsession.' But it was 'Sympathy for the Devil', and it became the track that we used.\"<ref name=\"wenner95\" />\n\nDuring the several days of recording the Stones as they played, a film lamp set up by Godard's crew, started a major fire in the studio that caused substantial damage to the studio and laid waste to some of the band\u2019s equipment. However, the song's tapes were saved by producer [[Jimmy Miller]] before he fled the studio, and Godard kept his cameras rolling capturing the fire on film as it roared on.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Guns N' Roses version ==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Sympathy for the Devil\n| cover      = Gnr sympathy.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Guns N' Roses]]\n| album      = [[Interview with the Vampire (soundtrack)|Interview with the Vampire soundtrack]]\n| B-side     = \"Escape to Paris\" (by Elliot Goldenthal)\n| released   = {{Start date|1994|12|13|df=y}}\n| recorded   = October 1994\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Hard rock]]\n| length     = {{Duration|m=7|s=36}}\n| label      = [[Geffen Records|Geffen]]\n| writer     = [[Jagger/Richards]]\n| producer   =\n*Guns N' Roses\n*[[Mike Clink]]\n*[[Matthias Gohl]]\n| prev_title = [[Since I Don't Have You#Guns N' Roses version|Since I Don't Have You]]\n| prev_year  = 1994\n| next_title = [[Chinese Democracy (song)|Chinese Democracy]]\n| next_year  = 2008\n}}\n\n[[Guns N' Roses]] recorded a cover in 1994 which reached number 55 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]; it was featured in the closing credits of [[Neil Jordan]]'s film adaptation of [[Anne Rice]]'s ''[[Interview with the Vampire (film)|Interview with the Vampire]]'' (except the 4K cut of the film) and was included on their ''[[Greatest Hits (Guns N' Roses album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album.

Welch and R. Costa; the permanent collection, containing images, text, cartography and more information on the Xavante people and language, is housed in the Museum of the Indian.\n\n===Language Overview===\nXavante is a member of the J\u00ea language family, itself a member of the Macro-G\u00ea stock.<ref name=\"Rodrigues\">{{cite book|last =Rodrigues|first=A.D.|title=The Amazonian Languages|date=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref> This stock is spoken in a wide distribution of non-central Brazil; Macro-G\u00ea is also popular in the eastern, northern, and central, and southwestern parts of the country, as well as being distributed in nearby Bolivia, Paraguay, and Argentina, but the J\u00ea family is its only remaining large subgroup, with other languages remaining in isolates due to extinction. Within J\u00ea, its 16 languages are distributed in four divisions; northern, north-eastern, central, and southern, and are better preserved than other languages in the stock due to its inland-inhabiting speakers. Xavante is classified in the central, alongside Xerente, Xaxriaba, and Akroa. The stock is marked by a large presence of [[nasal vowels]], this also being marked in the proto- J\u00ea reconstructed language. [[Consonant]] inventories of the Macro-Ge stock are of medium size, with Xavante historically undergoing a phonological change from velar consonants to [[glottal stops]]. All are mildly synthetic, without complex [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], and have SV constituent orders.\n\n===Ethnographies===\nThe Xavante people have been studied in [[ethnographies]]; in 2010 and 2011, demographic information and ethnographic details were researched for the context of health among the Xavante by Basta, and [[tuberculosis]] specifically being examined alongside ethnographic information by DeSouza. Contemporary Xavante research by Lecena and colleagues in 2016 and Da Silva in 1999 has also investigated inactivity and [[socioeconomic status]] in the region and general information regarding the ways that Xavante people were living in the late 20th and early 21st century.\n\n===Xavante in Linguistics===\nThe Xavante language was first referenced in the 19th century, in works of comparative philology which used word lists from the language and overviews of its structure.<ref name=\"Latham\">{{cite book|last =Latham|first =R.G.|title=Elements of Comparative Philology|url =https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.44766|date=1862|publisher=Walton and Maberly}}</ref><ref name=\"von Martius\">{{cite book|last =Von Martius|first =C.F.P.|title=W\u00f6rtersammlung Brasilianischer Sprachen|url =https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_B3z7W40v4oAC|date=1867|publisher=Friedrich Fleischer}}</ref> In the 20th century, Xavante has been studied academically since the 1960s by both Brazilian and foreign linguists, starting with a grammar;<ref name= \"MD\">{{cite journal|last =McLeod|first =R.|title=Xavante grammar|journal=Arquivo Ling\u00fc\u00edstico|volume=97|date=1960}}</ref> papers from this period examined the language\u2019s phonemes,<ref name=\"MB\">{{cite journal|last =McLeod|first =R.|title=Fonemas Xavante|journal=Serie Linguistica|volume=3|date=1974}}</ref> syllable structure,<ref name=\"BB\">{{cite book|last=Burgess|first=E.|title=Duas an\u00e1lises das s\u00edlabas do xav\u00e1nte|date=1971|publisher=Ling\u00fc\u00edstico de Ver\u00e3o}}</ref> as well as aspect and acquisition.<ref name=\"MA\">{{cite book|last=McLeod|first=R.|last2=Mitchell|first2=V.|title=Aspectos da l\u00edngua Xavante|date=1977|publisher=SIL}}</ref> By the 1980s, works on the syntax and semantics of Xavante were published, focusing on sentence initial devices<ref name=\"Grimes\">{{cite journal|last=Grimes|first=J.E.|title=Sentence initial devices|journal=Summer Institute of Linguistics Publications in Linguistics|volume=75|pages=233|date=1986}}</ref> and focus;<ref name=\"BC\">{{cite book|last=Burgess|first=E.|chapter= Focus and topic in Xavante|title=Sentence Initial Devices|date=1986|publisher=SIL}}</ref> the first Xavante-Portuguese dictionary was also produced by Hall, McLeod, and Mitchell, all of whom had researched extensively in Xavante (1987).

It is a rounded {{IPA|[\u0250\u0339]}} in certain stylistic conventions. {{IPA|/\u0254/}} is a mid vowel {{IPA|[\u0254\u031d\u02d0]}} when long, and a more open {{IPA|[\u0254]}} when short. {{IPA|/u/}} is {{IPA|[u\u02d0]}} when long and {{IPA|[u]}} or {{IPA|[\u028a]}} when short. {{IPA|/o/, /\u0268/,}} and {{IPA|/\u025b/}} do not vary much. {{IPA|/\u0259/}} is written {{angle bracket|\u00eb}} in the orthography.\n\n===Consonants===\nXavante has ten consonants, {{IPA|/p t c \u0294 b d j r w h/}}.

At a phonemic level, it arguably also lacks [[nasal stop|nasal consonants]], which is less unusual in the Amazon. The language however has a high degree of [[allophony]], and nasal stops {{IPA|[m n \u0272]}} appear before nasal vowels.<ref>It can be argued either that these are nasalized allophones of the voiced obstruents, that is, that {{IPA|/b/}} or {{IPA|/mb/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[m]}} before {{IPA|/\u00e3/}}, or that the voiced obstruents are denasalized allophones of nasal stops before oral vowels, with {{IPA|/m/}} pronounced {{IPA|[mb]}} or {{IPA|[b]}} before {{IPA|/a/}}. The key point is that nasality is determined by the vowels, not by the consonants.</ref>\n\n====Allophony====\nWith so few phonemic contrasts, Xavante allows wide latitude in [[allophone]]s of its consonants. \n* '''P''' and '''T''': {{IPA|/p/, /t/}} are [[Aspiration (linguistics)|aspirated]] {{IPA|[p\u02b0], [t\u032a\u02b0]}} as [[syllable onset]]s (at the beginning of a word, between vowels, or before /r/), and unreleased {{IPA|[p\u031a], [t\u032a\u031a]}} as [[syllable coda]]s (at the end of a word or before a consonant other than /r/).\n* '''C''': {{IPA|/c/}} [[free variation|freely varies]] among {{IPA|[t\u0283\u02b0, ts\u02b0, \u0283, s]}} as an onset, and {{IPA|[t\u032a\u02b2, \u0283]}} as a coda (only preceding another {{IPA|/c/}}, as {{IPA|[t\u02d0\u0283, \u0283\u02d0]}}).\n* '''\u2019''': {{IPA|/\u0294/}} is a glottal stop {{IPA|[\u0294]}}.\n* '''B''': In a C or CC syllable onset before an oral vowel, {{IPA|/b/}} is pronounced as a plain voiced stop {{IPA|[b]}} at the beginning of a phonological word, and as either {{IPA|[b]}} or as a [[prenasalization|prenasalized]] voiced stop {{IPA|[\u1d50b]}} in the middle of a word. Before nasal vowels, as C or CC, it is pronounced {{IPA|[m]}}.\n\n:As a syllable coda, {{IPA|/b/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[m]}} before {{IPA|/h/}} regardless of the following vowel's nasality, and optionally also as {{IPA|[m]}} before the oral allophones of the other voiced obstruents, {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/j/}}: {{IPA|[bd, bd\u0292]}} or {{IPA|[md, md\u0292]}}. It is {{IPA|[m]}} before {{IPA|[\u0272]}}.<ref>All voiced obstruents are presumably nasalized before all nasal allophones, though {{IPA|[m\u0272]}} is the only sequence that is attested.</ref>\n* '''D''': In a syllable onset before an oral vowel, {{IPA|/d/}} is pronounced either as a plain voiced stop {{IPA|[d\u032a]}} or as prenasalized voiced stop {{IPA|[\u207fd\u032a]}}. Unlike {{IPA|/b/}}, it may be prenasalized at the beginning of a phonological word, not just as a syllable onset. Before a nasal vowel, it is pronounced {{IPA|[n\u032a]}}.\n\n:As a syllable coda, {{IPA|/d/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[d\u032a]}} before the oral allophone of a consonant, and as {{IPA|[n\u032a]}} before a nasal consonant.\n* '''J''': In a syllable onset before an oral vowel, {{IPA|/j/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[dz, z, d\u0292, \u0292, j]}}, in [[free variation]]. Before a nasal vowel, it is pronounced {{IPA|[\u0272]}}.\n\n:As a syllable coda, {{IPA|/j/}} is generally pronounced {{IPA|[j]}}, and is nasalized to {{IPA|[\u0237\u0303]}} or {{IPA|[\u0272]}} ''after'' a nasal vowel.<ref>It is not yet clear when it is {{IPA|[\u0237\u0303]}} and when {{IPA|[\u0272]}}.</ref> It is also nasalized to {{IPA|[\u0237\u0303]}} before a prenasalized stop allophone. Between oral vowels, the sequence {{IPA|/jb/}} optionally takes an epenthetic {{IPA|[d]}}: {{IPA|[jb]}} or {{IPA|[jdb]}}. When {{IPA|[\u0272]}} is followed by an {{IPA|/h/}}, a nasalized [[epenthetic]] [[schwa]] separates them.\n* '''R''': {{IPA|/r/}} is an [[alveolar flap]], {{IPA|[\u027e]}}, which is nasalized {{IPA|[\u027e\u0303]}} between nasal vowels.\n* '''W''': {{IPA|/w/}} is similar to English ''w,'' but [[roundedness|not rounded]] before the vowel {{IPA|/i/}}.<ref>As McLeod & Mitchell (2003:11) describe it,\n:''antes da letra \u2018i\u2019 \u00e9 pronunciado como o \u2018w\u2019 ingl\u00eas, sem arredondamento dos l\u00e1bios e com um pouco de fric\u00e7\u00e3o. Em outros ambientes n\u00e3o h\u00e1 fric\u00e7\u00e3o e os l\u00e1bios se arredondam mais''\n\n:\"before the letter 'i' it's pronounced as the English 'w', without rounding of the lips and with a bit of friction. In other environments it doesn't have friction and the lips are more rounded\"\n\nThis would appear to mean that {{IPA|/w/}} is a more-or-less typical [[labio-velar approximant]] {{IPA|[w]}} in most situations, with an unrounded semi-fricative allophone, approximately {{IPA|[\u0263\u02d5]}}, before the vowel {{IPA|/i/}}, though possibly a [[roundedness|labially compressed]] velar {{IPA|[\u03b2\u031e\u0263\u02d5]}} in that environment.\n\nMcLeod (1974:4) had covered only the unrounded allophone:\n\n:''O fonema /w/ \u00e9 um voc\u00f3ide oral assil\u00e1bico, n\u00e3o-arredondado posterior fechado alto sonoro.''\n\n:\"The phoneme {{IPA|/w/}} is an oral semivowel, unrounded high back [and] voiced.\"</ref>\n\n* '''H''': {{IPA|/h/}} has no place of articulation, but is a voiceless transition between vowels.\n\nVowels do not become nasalized because of nasalized consonants, so the only consonants that become nasal are those in a cluster preceding a nasal vowel (and coda {{IPA|/j/}} after a nasal vowel); a preceding oral vowel blocks the nasality from spreading to preceding syllables.\n\n===Phonotactics===\nXavante syllables are of the forms [[Consonant|C]][[Vowel|V]], CCV, CVC, CCVC, CV:, and CCV:; that is, all syllables begin with a consonant, sometimes two; they may optionally either end with a consonant or have a long vowel. Although a ''syllable'' may end in a consonant, a phonological ''word'' may not, apart from a few cases of word-final {{IPA|/j/}}.\n\nThe attested initial CC [[consonant cluster]]s are: \n:{{IPA|/pr br \u0294r \u0294b \u0294w/}}.\nAll seven obstruents occur in final position, but in a maximal CCVC syllable only {{IPA|/p b j/}} are attested. Across two syllables, the following CC sequences are attested: \n:{{IPA|/pp, pt, pc, p\u0294/}}\n:{{IPA|/tt/}}\n:{{IPA|/cc/}}\n:{{IPA|/\u0294\u0294 \u0294b/}}\n:{{IPA|/bb, bd, bj, br, bh/}}\n:{{IPA|/dd/}}\n:{{IPA|/jp, jt, j\u0294, jb, jj, jw, jr, jh/}}.\nThere are also CCC sequences such as {{IPA|/p\u0294r/}} (coda {{IPA|/p/}} followed by onset {{IPA|/\u0294r/}}).\n\nThe vowels {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/\u0268/}} are rare, and not attested in maximal CCVC syllables.\n\n==Morphology==\nIn Xavante, morphological variations of words are a significant aspect of generating new constructions within the language.<ref name=\"Harrison\"/> For example, morphology reflects [[honorific]] status, in that morphemes are used to denote relationships of intimacy and kinship. Similarly, social positions and situations of individuals are marked using morphological constructions; for instance, a\u2019ama, a group of Xavante men trained in new forms of pre-existing words, are referred to by other members of the clan using a specific set of morphological forms. Xavante also uses a reflexive prefix, tsi-, in situations requiring this grammatical construction to be denoted; for instance, \u0294mad\u0259 (to look at) becomes tsi-\u0294mad\u0259 (to look at oneself). Finally, the postverbal morpheme ni appears when referring to a generic or unknown subject, as in \u2018ma \u00f8-w\u00e6r\u00e6 ni\u2019 (or \u2018someone (unknown) killed him. Morphological changes are important in generating meaning in Xavante, and reflect the possibilities of showing meaning using set morphemes.\n\nAs previously discussed, Xavante expresses relationships between people in its morphology. This is particularly reflected in familial connections; a child must use the respectful grammatical forms when growing older in reference to their parents and grandparents, and are scolded if they do not do so (Harrison, 2001). For example, the morpheme a is added to refer to a second person singular; a boy asking his grandfather to give a favour to his grandmother is generated thus:\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u00cf''||'''radare''||''\u00e3h\u00e3''||''\u00f5me''||''a-te||''s\u00e3r\u00e6 -re''||''na''||''ap\u00e2si''||''da-te''||''r\u00e5ne''||''da''\n|-\n| ||1SG||gr.father.ENDR ||here||there||2.RES-LTR||put.down-DIM||IMP||later||GEN-LTR||eat||PURP \n|}\n:\"Grandfather, here, put this over there for (grandmother) to eat later.\"\n\nConversation between men and their father-in-laws is also marked by use of honorific grammatical variants, used by both parties. Finally, a couple that has been arranged to be married also enter a specific relationship, known as dasiwasini, and must use grammatical forms denoting respect. In all, morphological variation in Xavante is critical to displaying intimacy and closeness between people, and in marking where such a relationship exists through the way they refer to one another, with more personal relationships being denoted by special grammatical forms. Also previously discussed was the use of the post-verbal morpheme ni whe referring to unknown subjects. This is formally known as a \u2018non-referential subject\u2019, in that the subject does not refer to immediate entity in the world; for instance in saying \u2018people\u2019 as a collective instead of \u2018my uncle\u2019. This morpheme is added in both transitive and intransitive clauses, for instance when saying both \u2018people love me\u2019 and \u2018people run\u2019. Ni is also commonly used with another morpheme, da, as a person prefix referring to a generic entity; for example, to use both transitive and intransitive sentences as examples:\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''Ma''||''t\u00f4''||''da-siwi''||''\u00f8-az\u00e2ri''||''ni''\n|-\n| ||N1.PST||CERT||GEN-COLL||3-hit||NREF.S \n|}\n:\"People (unspecified group) collectively beat him up.\"\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''Da-'ah\u00e2''||''na''||''te''||''ta13 -'ry'ry''||''ni''\n|-\n| ||GEN-a.lot||REF||N1||GEN-mourn||NREF.S|| \n|}\n:\"Lots of people are mourning.\"\n\nIn these ways, Xavante uses morphological variation to express concepts relating to abstract individuals that exist in a different way than concrete, specific people. By extension, the language uses morphology in general to conceptualize a variety of concepts, including closeness in relationships as well as personal prefixes.\n\n==Pronouns==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Grammatical person|Person]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Grammatical number|Singular]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Dual (grammatical number)|Dual]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Plural]]\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |[[Personal pronoun|Personal <br />pronouns]]\n| [[Grammatical person|1st person]]\n| /wa/, /\u0294\u012d/\n| \u2018I/me\u2019\n| /wa t\u00f4/, /\u0294\u0129wa/\n| 'we/us'(dual)\n| /wa t\u00f4/, /\u0294\u0129wa/\n| \u2018we/us\u2019(plural)\n|-\n| [[Grammatical person|2nd person]]\n| /te/, /\u0294a/\n| \u2018you\u2019\n| /ma t\u00f4/, /\u0294wa\u0294wa/ \n|'you' (dual)\n| /ma t\u00f4/\n| \u2018you' (plural)\n|-\n| [[Grammatical person|3rd person]]\n| /te/, /\u2205/\n| \u2018[[List of English third-person pronouns|he/she/it/him/her/they/them]]\u2019\n| /ma t\u00f4/\n| 'those two' (3rdP.)\n| /te/\n| \u2018they/them\u2019 (plural)\n|-\n|}{{col-end}}\n\n==Syntax==\n\n===Case===\n\nThe [[syntax]] of Xavante utilizes several types of case markings in its structures, marking the intransitive subject (S), transitive subject or agent (A), and transitive object or patient (O) in different ways.<ref name=\"Dias de Oliveira Santos\">{{cite book|last=Dias de Oliveira Santos|first=V.|date=2008|title=Languages of the World and Their Case Marking|publisher=Belo Horizonte Faculdade de Letras da UFMG.}}</ref> First, it distinguishes between a number marking system and a person marking system, with both containing several subsystems. The former uses a neutral subsystem when arguments fulfill certain criteria. It also includes a Nominative-Accusative subsystem when the (O) of a transitive argument falls under a specified category. Finally, the person marking system of Xavante is notable for having multiple subsystems. As a consequence, examining these case systems is vital to understanding the syntax of Xavante.\n\nXavante\u2019s case systems emphasise the lexicalization of number systems. Particles in the language depend on whether it is in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd person; whether the referent is in the subject, object, possessor, or complement position; and if the predicate is a noun (nominal) or a verb (verbal). Xavante also uses a singular, dual, and plural, and the number of the referent also dictate which number particle will be used. Within this number marking system, verbal clauses use a neutral marking subsystem, in which the marking of (A), (S), and (O) is identical whenever these arguments are singular or when (O) is definite and all three arguments are non-singular. A neutral system is marked for having the three arguments marked identically, and is common across languages. In Xavante, this situation is referred to as neutral because, in the first case, none of the three core arguments get marked, and in the second all get the same marking. An example is seen here:\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u2205''||''te''||''\u0294aj-wawa-j''||''\u0294wa:\u0294wa''   \n|-\n| ||2||POT||2-cry-NZR||DUAL\n|}\n:\"You are both crying.\"\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u0294wa''||''d\u00f5r\u0129''||''\u0294wa\u0294wa''||''h\u00e3''||''b\u0129tsi''||''pe\u0294a''||''\u2205''||''te''||''\u0294i-\u0294r\u1ebd-d\u1ebd''||''\u0294wa''   \n|-\n| ||2||SN||DUAL||EMP||one||fish||2||POT||3-eat-NZR||DUAL\n|}\n:\"You (both) eat one fish.\"\n\nThe number system in Xavante also contains a nominative-accusative subsystem, found when (O) is non-singular and indefinite, when (O) is 1st person dual, or (O) is 2nd person dual and (A) 1st person plural simultaneously. A nominative-accusative system is marked when (S) and (A) are treated equally, while (O) differs, with the first two obtaining nominative marking and the third getting accusative. In Xavante, the nominative-accusative subsystem most commonly marks (O) for number while the other two do not get marking, although the reverse is also true. This is seen in the following example:\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u2205''||''te''||''ti-\u0294a\u0294a''||''dzahu:re'' \n|-\n| ||3||POT||3 \u2013 cough||DUAL\n|}\n:\"They are both coughing.\"\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u2205''||''te''||''\u0294i- b\u00e3dz\u00e3- ri''||''dzahure''||''tsi\u0294\u00f5d\u00f5''||''h\u00e3''\n|-\n| ||3||ERG||3-make-NZR||DUAL||basket||EMP\n|}\n:\"It was made by both of them, the basket.\"\n\nXavante also uses a person-marking system, in which subjects and objects are marked differently depending on a number of criteria. The absolutive series marks both intransitive subjects and transitive objects; the accusative series marks 1st person dual, plural object, 3rd person singular, or dual or plural object when the subject is 2nd person singular, dual, or plural; the nominative series marks the subject of both transitive and intransitive clauses; and am emphatic series that marks pronouns to form emphatic pronominal expressions with both transitive and intransitive clauses. The person-marking system has more subsystems that the number one, with three variations of ergative-absolutive case markings. Ergative-Absolutive is marked as (S) and (O) being equal, with (A) being different, and the first two being assigned as ergative and the third assigned as absolutive. In Xavante, Ergative-Absolutive I uses cross-referencing on (S) and (O) only, with (A) receiving no marking. Ergative-Absolutive II is marked when (O) is in 3rd person indefinite and (A) is 2nd person plural. Ergative-Absolutive III is marked with the use of a particle or adposition after the noun, with (A) receiving a mark and (S) and (O) not receiving one, and is only used relative and subordinate transitive clauses or negated independent transitive clauses:\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u0294wa''||''\u2205''||''\u0294wa - \u0294a\u0294a''||''d\u0129''\n|-\n| ||1||POT||1-      cough||DUAL\n|}\n:\"We both cough.\"\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u0294wa''||''\u2205''||''\u0294a-tsa-ri''||''d\u0129''\n|-\n| ||1||POT||2-bite-NZR||DUAL\n|}\n:\"We both bit you.\"\n\nXavante\u2019s person marking system also contains a tripartite subsystem, in which (A), (S), and (O) are all treated differently. In Xavante, this specifically occurs as all arguments receiving different arguments from the different series previously discussed. This is seen here:\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u0294wa''||''\u2205''||''\u0294i:-wawa''||''\u2205''\n|-\n| ||1||POT||1-cry||sing\n|}\n:\"I cry.\"\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u2205''||''b\u00e3''||''te''||''\u0294iwa \u2013 tsa''\n|-\n| ||2||PERF||POT||1-        bite\n|}\n:\"We both hit you.\"\n\nXavante\u2019s person-marking system also has a variation of a Nominative-Accusative system, in which (S) and (A) are marked differently from (O)\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u0294wa''||''\u2205''||''\u0294i:-wawa''||''\u2205''\n|-\n| ||1||POT||1-cry||sing\n|}\n:\"I cry.\"\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u2205''||''b\u00e3''||''te''||''\u0294iwa \u2013 tsa''\n|-\n| ||2||PERF||POT||1-        bite||\n|}\n:\"We both hit you.\"\n\nFinally, Xavante has two Split subsystems; the first, Split-S, is found in the subjects of nominal predicates. The second, Split-O, occurs in relative clauses. Overall, the person marking system in Xavante contains multiple subsystems depending on the situations in which they appear.\n\nIn all, Xavante uses a number of case marking systems in its clauses, varying based on number and person markings. It provides examples of a neutral system, Nominative-Accusative subsystems, Ergative-Absolutive subsystems, and split subsystems, varying based on different triggers.\n\n==Semantics==\n\n===Plurals===\n\nIn the Xavante language, [[plurals]] as well as [[duals]] are used to mark arguments in a clause.<ref name=\"Dias de Oliveira Santos\" /> The language differentiates between singular nouns and dual, of which there is a quantity of two, and plural, in which the argument contains more than two items. These are expressed using morphological methods, including units that are used in a variety of contexts, including in different combinations. These markings appear to be used particularly for human subjects, and overall are vital to the structure of a clause in Xavante.\n\nDual arguments in Xavante, particularly those referring to people, use one of several possible morphological units. In order to describe a pair of human arguments, it is first important to distinguish between the first, second, and third person. For using the dual in the first person as a subject, such as in \u2018We both\u2019, the morpheme \u0294wa is used in the beginning of the [[clause]], with d\u0129 at the end of the clause; in combination they produce the first person dual. This is seen here:\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u0294wa''||''\u2205''||''\u0294a-tsa-ri''||''d\u0129''\n|-\n| ||1||POT||2-bite-NZR||DUAL\n|}\n:\"We both bite you.\"\n\nWhen using the dual first person as an object, however, a different morpheme, \u0294\u0129wa, is attached to the main verb, for instance as here:\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u2205''||''b\u00e3''||''te''||''\u0294\u0129wa \u2013 tsa'' \n|-\n| ||2||PERF||POT||   1-       bite|| \n|}\n:\"You bit both of us.\"\n\nWhen using the dual in the second person, for instance in saying \u2018You both\u2019, reduplication is used to denote optionality in the clause. In the first case, when \u2018both\u2019 is implied, \u0294wa alone is used at the end of the clause, with the reduplicated \u0294wa\u0294wa occurring earlier as follows:\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u0294wa''||''d\u00f5r\u0129''||''\u0294wa\u0294wa''||''h\u00e3''||''b\u0129tsi''||''pe\u0294a''||''\u2205''||''te''||''\u0294\u012d - r\u1ebd - d\u0115''||''\u0294wa''\n|-\n| ||2||SN||DUAL||EMP||one||fish||2||POT||3 \u2013 eat \u2013 NZR||DUAL\n|}\n:\"You (both) eat one fish.\"\n\nHowever, when the dual is not optional in the clause, only the reduplicated \u0294wa\u0294wa occurs, at the end of the clause, as here:\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u2205''||''te''||''\u0294ai - wawa - j''||''\u0294wa\u02d0\u0294wa''\n|-\n| ||2||POT||2 -   cry -    NZR||DUAL\n|}\n:\"You are both crying.\"\n\nFinally, third person dual is also denoted similarly depending on whether the argument is in the subject or object position. For the former, the morpheme dzahur\u025b is placed clause-finally, and denotes \u2018They both\u2019, as seen here:\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u0294\u00f5''||''d\u00f5r\u0129''||''\u0294i-ts-i-       oto''||''dzahur\u025b'' \n|-\n| ||3||NS||3-R-MED-bent||DUAL\n|}\n:\"They are both bent.\"\n\nHowever, when the third person dual is in the object position, the same morpheme, dzahur\u025b, is also used, as in the following example:\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u0294\u00f5''||''d\u00f5r\u0129''||''h\u00e3''||''\u2205''||''te''||''dza''||''\u2205- \u0294atsabr\u00f5''||''dzahur\u025b''\n|-\n| ||3||NS||EMP||3||POT||PROJ||3-run||DUAL\n|}\n:\"Both of them will run.\"\n\nIn all, the dual marks all arguments in Xavante, and differentiates between first, second, and third person in subject and object positions.\n\nPlurals in Xavante, in which more than two arguments are described, is expressed using its own variations of morphemes. In the first person and third person, dza\u0294ra is used clause-finally, as here:\n\n {|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u0294wa''||''d\u00f5r\u0129''||''\u0294iwa - dz -      \u0129 - oto''||''dza\u0294ra''\n|-\n| ||1||NS||1-   R||MED- bent||PLURAL\n|}\n:\"We are all bent.\"\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u0294\u00f5''||''d\u00f5r\u0129''||''\u0294i-ts-i-       oto''||''dza\u0294ra'' \n| ||3||NS||3-R-MED- bent||PLURAL\n|}\n:\"They are all bent.\"\n\nHowever, the second person plural is expressed differently, with the previous morpheme, dza\u0294ra, being combined with \u0294wa\u0294wa in two positions, clause-medially after the initial person marker and clause-finally, as here:\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u0294a''||''d\u00f5r\u0129''||''\u0294wa\u0294wa''||''\u0294aj -rare''||''dza\u0294ra''||''\u0294wa\u0294wa''\n|-\n| ||2||NS||DUAL||2-   small||PLURAL||DUAL\n|}\n:\"They are all small.\"\n\nIn all, the plural in Xavante is expressed with less variation than in the dual, but nonetheless is always important to marking quantity of human subjects in the first, second, and third person.\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n*McLeod, Ruth & Mitchell, Valerie.

Within J\u00ea, its 16 languages are distributed in four divisions; northern, north-eastern, central, and southern, and are better preserved than other languages in the stock due to its inland-inhabiting speakers. Xavante is classified in the central, alongside Xerente, Xaxriaba, and Akroa. The stock is marked by a large presence of [[nasal vowels]], this also being marked in the proto- J\u00ea reconstructed language. [[Consonant]] inventories of the Macro-Ge stock are of medium size, with Xavante historically undergoing a phonological change from velar consonants to [[glottal stops]]. All are mildly synthetic, without complex [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], and have SV constituent orders.\n\n===Ethnographies===\nThe Xavante people have been studied in [[ethnographies]]; in 2010 and 2011, demographic information and ethnographic details were researched for the context of health among the Xavante by Basta, and [[tuberculosis]] specifically being examined alongside ethnographic information by DeSouza. Contemporary Xavante research by Lecena and colleagues in 2016 and Da Silva in 1999 has also investigated inactivity and [[socioeconomic status]] in the region and general information regarding the ways that Xavante people were living in the late 20th and early 21st century.\n\n===Xavante in Linguistics===\nThe Xavante language was first referenced in the 19th century, in works of comparative philology which used word lists from the language and overviews of its structure.<ref name=\"Latham\">{{cite book|last =Latham|first =R.G.|title=Elements of Comparative Philology|url =https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.44766|date=1862|publisher=Walton and Maberly}}</ref><ref name=\"von Martius\">{{cite book|last =Von Martius|first =C.F.P.|title=W\u00f6rtersammlung Brasilianischer Sprachen|url =https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_B3z7W40v4oAC|date=1867|publisher=Friedrich Fleischer}}</ref> In the 20th century, Xavante has been studied academically since the 1960s by both Brazilian and foreign linguists, starting with a grammar;<ref name= \"MD\">{{cite journal|last =McLeod|first =R.|title=Xavante grammar|journal=Arquivo Ling\u00fc\u00edstico|volume=97|date=1960}}</ref> papers from this period examined the language\u2019s phonemes,<ref name=\"MB\">{{cite journal|last =McLeod|first =R.|title=Fonemas Xavante|journal=Serie Linguistica|volume=3|date=1974}}</ref> syllable structure,<ref name=\"BB\">{{cite book|last=Burgess|first=E.|title=Duas an\u00e1lises das s\u00edlabas do xav\u00e1nte|date=1971|publisher=Ling\u00fc\u00edstico de Ver\u00e3o}}</ref> as well as aspect and acquisition.<ref name=\"MA\">{{cite book|last=McLeod|first=R.|last2=Mitchell|first2=V.|title=Aspectos da l\u00edngua Xavante|date=1977|publisher=SIL}}</ref> By the 1980s, works on the syntax and semantics of Xavante were published, focusing on sentence initial devices<ref name=\"Grimes\">{{cite journal|last=Grimes|first=J.E.|title=Sentence initial devices|journal=Summer Institute of Linguistics Publications in Linguistics|volume=75|pages=233|date=1986}}</ref> and focus;<ref name=\"BC\">{{cite book|last=Burgess|first=E.|chapter= Focus and topic in Xavante|title=Sentence Initial Devices|date=1986|publisher=SIL}}</ref> the first Xavante-Portuguese dictionary was also produced by Hall, McLeod, and Mitchell, all of whom had researched extensively in Xavante (1987).

It is a rounded {{IPA|[\u0250\u0339]}} in certain stylistic conventions. {{IPA|/\u0254/}} is a mid vowel {{IPA|[\u0254\u031d\u02d0]}} when long, and a more open {{IPA|[\u0254]}} when short. {{IPA|/u/}} is {{IPA|[u\u02d0]}} when long and {{IPA|[u]}} or {{IPA|[\u028a]}} when short. {{IPA|/o/, /\u0268/,}} and {{IPA|/\u025b/}} do not vary much. {{IPA|/\u0259/}} is written {{angle bracket|\u00eb}} in the orthography.\n\n===Consonants===\nXavante has ten consonants, {{IPA|/p t c \u0294 b d j r w h/}}.

At a phonemic level, it arguably also lacks [[nasal stop|nasal consonants]], which is less unusual in the Amazon. The language however has a high degree of [[allophony]], and nasal stops {{IPA|[m n \u0272]}} appear before nasal vowels.<ref>It can be argued either that these are nasalized allophones of the voiced obstruents, that is, that {{IPA|/b/}} or {{IPA|/mb/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[m]}} before {{IPA|/\u00e3/}}, or that the voiced obstruents are denasalized allophones of nasal stops before oral vowels, with {{IPA|/m/}} pronounced {{IPA|[mb]}} or {{IPA|[b]}} before {{IPA|/a/}}. The key point is that nasality is determined by the vowels, not by the consonants.</ref>\n\n====Allophony====\nWith so few phonemic contrasts, Xavante allows wide latitude in [[allophone]]s of its consonants. \n* '''P''' and '''T''': {{IPA|/p/, /t/}} are [[Aspiration (linguistics)|aspirated]] {{IPA|[p\u02b0], [t\u032a\u02b0]}} as [[syllable onset]]s (at the beginning of a word, between vowels, or before /r/), and unreleased {{IPA|[p\u031a], [t\u032a\u031a]}} as [[syllable coda]]s (at the end of a word or before a consonant other than /r/).\n* '''C''': {{IPA|/c/}} [[free variation|freely varies]] among {{IPA|[t\u0283\u02b0, ts\u02b0, \u0283, s]}} as an onset, and {{IPA|[t\u032a\u02b2, \u0283]}} as a coda (only preceding another {{IPA|/c/}}, as {{IPA|[t\u02d0\u0283, \u0283\u02d0]}}).\n* '''\u2019''': {{IPA|/\u0294/}} is a glottal stop {{IPA|[\u0294]}}.\n* '''B''': In a C or CC syllable onset before an oral vowel, {{IPA|/b/}} is pronounced as a plain voiced stop {{IPA|[b]}} at the beginning of a phonological word, and as either {{IPA|[b]}} or as a [[prenasalization|prenasalized]] voiced stop {{IPA|[\u1d50b]}} in the middle of a word. Before nasal vowels, as C or CC, it is pronounced {{IPA|[m]}}.\n\n:As a syllable coda, {{IPA|/b/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[m]}} before {{IPA|/h/}} regardless of the following vowel's nasality, and optionally also as {{IPA|[m]}} before the oral allophones of the other voiced obstruents, {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/j/}}: {{IPA|[bd, bd\u0292]}} or {{IPA|[md, md\u0292]}}. It is {{IPA|[m]}} before {{IPA|[\u0272]}}.<ref>All voiced obstruents are presumably nasalized before all nasal allophones, though {{IPA|[m\u0272]}} is the only sequence that is attested.</ref>\n* '''D''': In a syllable onset before an oral vowel, {{IPA|/d/}} is pronounced either as a plain voiced stop {{IPA|[d\u032a]}} or as prenasalized voiced stop {{IPA|[\u207fd\u032a]}}. Unlike {{IPA|/b/}}, it may be prenasalized at the beginning of a phonological word, not just as a syllable onset. Before a nasal vowel, it is pronounced {{IPA|[n\u032a]}}.\n\n:As a syllable coda, {{IPA|/d/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[d\u032a]}} before the oral allophone of a consonant, and as {{IPA|[n\u032a]}} before a nasal consonant.\n* '''J''': In a syllable onset before an oral vowel, {{IPA|/j/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[dz, z, d\u0292, \u0292, j]}}, in [[free variation]]. Before a nasal vowel, it is pronounced {{IPA|[\u0272]}}.\n\n:As a syllable coda, {{IPA|/j/}} is generally pronounced {{IPA|[j]}}, and is nasalized to {{IPA|[\u0237\u0303]}} or {{IPA|[\u0272]}} ''after'' a nasal vowel.<ref>It is not yet clear when it is {{IPA|[\u0237\u0303]}} and when {{IPA|[\u0272]}}.</ref> It is also nasalized to {{IPA|[\u0237\u0303]}} before a prenasalized stop allophone. Between oral vowels, the sequence {{IPA|/jb/}} optionally takes an epenthetic {{IPA|[d]}}: {{IPA|[jb]}} or {{IPA|[jdb]}}. When {{IPA|[\u0272]}} is followed by an {{IPA|/h/}}, a nasalized [[epenthetic]] [[schwa]] separates them.\n* '''R''': {{IPA|/r/}} is an [[alveolar flap]], {{IPA|[\u027e]}}, which is nasalized {{IPA|[\u027e\u0303]}} between nasal vowels.\n* '''W''': {{IPA|/w/}} is similar to English ''w,'' but [[roundedness|not rounded]] before the vowel {{IPA|/i/}}.<ref>As McLeod & Mitchell (2003:11) describe it,\n:''antes da letra \u2018i\u2019 \u00e9 pronunciado como o \u2018w\u2019 ingl\u00eas, sem arredondamento dos l\u00e1bios e com um pouco de fric\u00e7\u00e3o. Em outros ambientes n\u00e3o h\u00e1 fric\u00e7\u00e3o e os l\u00e1bios se arredondam mais''\n\n:\"before the letter 'i' it's pronounced as the English 'w', without rounding of the lips and with a bit of friction. In other environments it doesn't have friction and the lips are more rounded\"\n\nThis would appear to mean that {{IPA|/w/}} is a more-or-less typical [[labio-velar approximant]] {{IPA|[w]}} in most situations, with an unrounded semi-fricative allophone, approximately {{IPA|[\u0263\u02d5]}}, before the vowel {{IPA|/i/}}, though possibly a [[roundedness|labially compressed]] velar {{IPA|[\u03b2\u031e\u0263\u02d5]}} in that environment.\n\nMcLeod (1974:4) had covered only the unrounded allophone:\n\n:''O fonema /w/ \u00e9 um voc\u00f3ide oral assil\u00e1bico, n\u00e3o-arredondado posterior fechado alto sonoro.''\n\n:\"The phoneme {{IPA|/w/}} is an oral semivowel, unrounded high back [and] voiced.\"</ref>\n\n* '''H''': {{IPA|/h/}} has no place of articulation, but is a voiceless transition between vowels.\n\nVowels do not become nasalized because of nasalized consonants, so the only consonants that become nasal are those in a cluster preceding a nasal vowel (and coda {{IPA|/j/}} after a nasal vowel); a preceding oral vowel blocks the nasality from spreading to preceding syllables.\n\n===Phonotactics===\nXavante syllables are of the forms [[Consonant|C]][[Vowel|V]], CCV, CVC, CCVC, CV:, and CCV:; that is, all syllables begin with a consonant, sometimes two; they may optionally either end with a consonant or have a long vowel. Although a ''syllable'' may end in a consonant, a phonological ''word'' may not, apart from a few cases of word-final {{IPA|/j/}}.\n\nThe attested initial CC [[consonant cluster]]s are: \n:{{IPA|/pr br \u0294r \u0294b \u0294w/}}.\nAll seven obstruents occur in final position, but in a maximal CCVC syllable only {{IPA|/p b j/}} are attested. Across two syllables, the following CC sequences are attested: \n:{{IPA|/pp, pt, pc, p\u0294/}}\n:{{IPA|/tt/}}\n:{{IPA|/cc/}}\n:{{IPA|/\u0294\u0294 \u0294b/}}\n:{{IPA|/bb, bd, bj, br, bh/}}\n:{{IPA|/dd/}}\n:{{IPA|/jp, jt, j\u0294, jb, jj, jw, jr, jh/}}.\nThere are also CCC sequences such as {{IPA|/p\u0294r/}} (coda {{IPA|/p/}} followed by onset {{IPA|/\u0294r/}}).\n\nThe vowels {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/\u0268/}} are rare, and not attested in maximal CCVC syllables.\n\n==Morphology==\nIn Xavante, morphological variations of words are a significant aspect of generating new constructions within the language.<ref name=\"Harrison\"/> For example, morphology reflects [[honorific]] status, in that morphemes are used to denote relationships of intimacy and kinship. Similarly, social positions and situations of individuals are marked using morphological constructions; for instance, a\u2019ama, a group of Xavante men trained in new forms of pre-existing words, are referred to by other members of the clan using a specific set of morphological forms. Xavante also uses a reflexive prefix, tsi-, in situations requiring this grammatical construction to be denoted; for instance, \u0294mad\u0259 (to look at) becomes tsi-\u0294mad\u0259 (to look at oneself). Finally, the postverbal morpheme ni appears when referring to a generic or unknown subject, as in \u2018ma \u00f8-w\u00e6r\u00e6 ni\u2019 (or \u2018someone (unknown) killed him. Morphological changes are important in generating meaning in Xavante, and reflect the possibilities of showing meaning using set morphemes.\n\nAs previously discussed, Xavante expresses relationships between people in its morphology. This is particularly reflected in familial connections; a child must use the respectful grammatical forms when growing older in reference to their parents and grandparents, and are scolded if they do not do so (Harrison, 2001). For example, the morpheme a is added to refer to a second person singular; a boy asking his grandfather to give a favour to his grandmother is generated thus:\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u00cf''||'''radare''||''\u00e3h\u00e3''||''\u00f5me''||''a-te||''s\u00e3r\u00e6 -re''||''na''||''ap\u00e2si''||''da-te''||''r\u00e5ne''||''da''\n|-\n| ||1SG||gr.father.ENDR ||here||there||2.RES-LTR||put.down-DIM||IMP||later||GEN-LTR||eat||PURP \n|}\n:\"Grandfather, here, put this over there for (grandmother) to eat later.\"\n\nConversation between men and their father-in-laws is also marked by use of honorific grammatical variants, used by both parties. Finally, a couple that has been arranged to be married also enter a specific relationship, known as dasiwasini, and must use grammatical forms denoting respect. In all, morphological variation in Xavante is critical to displaying intimacy and closeness between people, and in marking where such a relationship exists through the way they refer to one another, with more personal relationships being denoted by special grammatical forms. Also previously discussed was the use of the post-verbal morpheme ni whe referring to unknown subjects. This is formally known as a \u2018non-referential subject\u2019, in that the subject does not refer to immediate entity in the world; for instance in saying \u2018people\u2019 as a collective instead of \u2018my uncle\u2019. This morpheme is added in both transitive and intransitive clauses, for instance when saying both \u2018people love me\u2019 and \u2018people run\u2019. Ni is also commonly used with another morpheme, da, as a person prefix referring to a generic entity; for example, to use both transitive and intransitive sentences as examples:\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''Ma''||''t\u00f4''||''da-siwi''||''\u00f8-az\u00e2ri''||''ni''\n|-\n| ||N1.PST||CERT||GEN-COLL||3-hit||NREF.S \n|}\n:\"People (unspecified group) collectively beat him up.\"\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''Da-'ah\u00e2''||''na''||''te''||''ta13 -'ry'ry''||''ni''\n|-\n| ||GEN-a.lot||REF||N1||GEN-mourn||NREF.S|| \n|}\n:\"Lots of people are mourning.\"\n\nIn these ways, Xavante uses morphological variation to express concepts relating to abstract individuals that exist in a different way than concrete, specific people. By extension, the language uses morphology in general to conceptualize a variety of concepts, including closeness in relationships as well as personal prefixes.\n\n==Pronouns==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Grammatical person|Person]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Grammatical number|Singular]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Dual (grammatical number)|Dual]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Plural]]\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" |[[Personal pronoun|Personal <br />pronouns]]\n| [[Grammatical person|1st person]]\n| /wa/, /\u0294\u012d/\n| \u2018I/me\u2019\n| /wa t\u00f4/, /\u0294\u0129wa/\n| 'we/us'(dual)\n| /wa t\u00f4/, /\u0294\u0129wa/\n| \u2018we/us\u2019(plural)\n|-\n| [[Grammatical person|2nd person]]\n| /te/, /\u0294a/\n| \u2018you\u2019\n| /ma t\u00f4/, /\u0294wa\u0294wa/ \n|'you' (dual)\n| /ma t\u00f4/\n| \u2018you' (plural)\n|-\n| [[Grammatical person|3rd person]]\n| /te/, /\u2205/\n| \u2018[[List of English third-person pronouns|he/she/it/him/her/they/them]]\u2019\n| /ma t\u00f4/\n| 'those two' (3rdP.)\n| /te/\n| \u2018they/them\u2019 (plural)\n|-\n|}{{col-end}}\n\n==Syntax==\n\n===Case===\n\nThe [[syntax]] of Xavante utilizes several types of case markings in its structures, marking the intransitive subject (S), transitive subject or agent (A), and transitive object or patient (O) in different ways.<ref name=\"Dias de Oliveira Santos\">{{cite book|last=Dias de Oliveira Santos|first=V.|date=2008|title=Languages of the World and Their Case Marking|publisher=Belo Horizonte Faculdade de Letras da UFMG.}}</ref> First, it distinguishes between a number marking system and a person marking system, with both containing several subsystems. The former uses a neutral subsystem when arguments fulfill certain criteria. It also includes a Nominative-Accusative subsystem when the (O) of a transitive argument falls under a specified category. Finally, the person marking system of Xavante is notable for having multiple subsystems. As a consequence, examining these case systems is vital to understanding the syntax of Xavante.\n\nXavante\u2019s case systems emphasise the lexicalization of number systems. Particles in the language depend on whether it is in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd person; whether the referent is in the subject, object, possessor, or complement position; and if the predicate is a noun (nominal) or a verb (verbal). Xavante also uses a singular, dual, and plural, and the number of the referent also dictate which number particle will be used. Within this number marking system, verbal clauses use a neutral marking subsystem, in which the marking of (A), (S), and (O) is identical whenever these arguments are singular or when (O) is definite and all three arguments are non-singular. A neutral system is marked for having the three arguments marked identically, and is common across languages. In Xavante, this situation is referred to as neutral because, in the first case, none of the three core arguments get marked, and in the second all get the same marking. An example is seen here:\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u2205''||''te''||''\u0294aj-wawa-j''||''\u0294wa:\u0294wa''   \n|-\n| ||2||POT||2-cry-NZR||DUAL\n|}\n:\"You are both crying.\"\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u0294wa''||''d\u00f5r\u0129''||''\u0294wa\u0294wa''||''h\u00e3''||''b\u0129tsi''||''pe\u0294a''||''\u2205''||''te''||''\u0294i-\u0294r\u1ebd-d\u1ebd''||''\u0294wa''   \n|-\n| ||2||SN||DUAL||EMP||one||fish||2||POT||3-eat-NZR||DUAL\n|}\n:\"You (both) eat one fish.\"\n\nThe number system in Xavante also contains a nominative-accusative subsystem, found when (O) is non-singular and indefinite, when (O) is 1st person dual, or (O) is 2nd person dual and (A) 1st person plural simultaneously. A nominative-accusative system is marked when (S) and (A) are treated equally, while (O) differs, with the first two obtaining nominative marking and the third getting accusative. In Xavante, the nominative-accusative subsystem most commonly marks (O) for number while the other two do not get marking, although the reverse is also true. This is seen in the following example:\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u2205''||''te''||''ti-\u0294a\u0294a''||''dzahu:re'' \n|-\n| ||3||POT||3 \u2013 cough||DUAL\n|}\n:\"They are both coughing.\"\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u2205''||''te''||''\u0294i- b\u00e3dz\u00e3- ri''||''dzahure''||''tsi\u0294\u00f5d\u00f5''||''h\u00e3''\n|-\n| ||3||ERG||3-make-NZR||DUAL||basket||EMP\n|}\n:\"It was made by both of them, the basket.\"\n\nXavante also uses a person-marking system, in which subjects and objects are marked differently depending on a number of criteria. The absolutive series marks both intransitive subjects and transitive objects; the accusative series marks 1st person dual, plural object, 3rd person singular, or dual or plural object when the subject is 2nd person singular, dual, or plural; the nominative series marks the subject of both transitive and intransitive clauses; and am emphatic series that marks pronouns to form emphatic pronominal expressions with both transitive and intransitive clauses. The person-marking system has more subsystems that the number one, with three variations of ergative-absolutive case markings. Ergative-Absolutive is marked as (S) and (O) being equal, with (A) being different, and the first two being assigned as ergative and the third assigned as absolutive. In Xavante, Ergative-Absolutive I uses cross-referencing on (S) and (O) only, with (A) receiving no marking. Ergative-Absolutive II is marked when (O) is in 3rd person indefinite and (A) is 2nd person plural. Ergative-Absolutive III is marked with the use of a particle or adposition after the noun, with (A) receiving a mark and (S) and (O) not receiving one, and is only used relative and subordinate transitive clauses or negated independent transitive clauses:\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u0294wa''||''\u2205''||''\u0294wa - \u0294a\u0294a''||''d\u0129''\n|-\n| ||1||POT||1-      cough||DUAL\n|}\n:\"We both cough.\"\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u0294wa''||''\u2205''||''\u0294a-tsa-ri''||''d\u0129''\n|-\n| ||1||POT||2-bite-NZR||DUAL\n|}\n:\"We both bit you.\"\n\nXavante\u2019s person marking system also contains a tripartite subsystem, in which (A), (S), and (O) are all treated differently. In Xavante, this specifically occurs as all arguments receiving different arguments from the different series previously discussed. This is seen here:\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u0294wa''||''\u2205''||''\u0294i:-wawa''||''\u2205''\n|-\n| ||1||POT||1-cry||sing\n|}\n:\"I cry.\"\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u2205''||''b\u00e3''||''te''||''\u0294iwa \u2013 tsa''\n|-\n| ||2||PERF||POT||1-        bite\n|}\n:\"We both hit you.\"\n\nXavante\u2019s person-marking system also has a variation of a Nominative-Accusative system, in which (S) and (A) are marked differently from (O)\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u0294wa''||''\u2205''||''\u0294i:-wawa''||''\u2205''\n|-\n| ||1||POT||1-cry||sing\n|}\n:\"I cry.\"\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u2205''||''b\u00e3''||''te''||''\u0294iwa \u2013 tsa''\n|-\n| ||2||PERF||POT||1-        bite||\n|}\n:\"We both hit you.\"\n\nFinally, Xavante has two Split subsystems; the first, Split-S, is found in the subjects of nominal predicates. The second, Split-O, occurs in relative clauses. Overall, the person marking system in Xavante contains multiple subsystems depending on the situations in which they appear.\n\nIn all, Xavante uses a number of case marking systems in its clauses, varying based on number and person markings. It provides examples of a neutral system, Nominative-Accusative subsystems, Ergative-Absolutive subsystems, and split subsystems, varying based on different triggers.\n\n==Semantics==\n\n===Plurals===\n\nIn the Xavante language, [[plurals]] as well as [[duals]] are used to mark arguments in a clause.<ref name=\"Dias de Oliveira Santos\" /> The language differentiates between singular nouns and dual, of which there is a quantity of two, and plural, in which the argument contains more than two items. These are expressed using morphological methods, including units that are used in a variety of contexts, including in different combinations. These markings appear to be used particularly for human subjects, and overall are vital to the structure of a clause in Xavante.\n\nDual arguments in Xavante, particularly those referring to people, use one of several possible morphological units. In order to describe a pair of human arguments, it is first important to distinguish between the first, second, and third person. For using the dual in the first person as a subject, such as in \u2018We both\u2019, the morpheme \u0294wa is used in the beginning of the [[clause]], with d\u0129 at the end of the clause; in combination they produce the first person dual. This is seen here:\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u0294wa''||''\u2205''||''\u0294a-tsa-ri''||''d\u0129''\n|-\n| ||1||POT||2-bite-NZR||DUAL\n|}\n:\"We both bite you.\"\n\nWhen using the dual first person as an object, however, a different morpheme, \u0294\u0129wa, is attached to the main verb, for instance as here:\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u2205''||''b\u00e3''||''te''||''\u0294\u0129wa \u2013 tsa'' \n|-\n| ||2||PERF||POT||   1-       bite|| \n|}\n:\"You bit both of us.\"\n\nWhen using the dual in the second person, for instance in saying \u2018You both\u2019, reduplication is used to denote optionality in the clause. In the first case, when \u2018both\u2019 is implied, \u0294wa alone is used at the end of the clause, with the reduplicated \u0294wa\u0294wa occurring earlier as follows:\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u0294wa''||''d\u00f5r\u0129''||''\u0294wa\u0294wa''||''h\u00e3''||''b\u0129tsi''||''pe\u0294a''||''\u2205''||''te''||''\u0294\u012d - r\u1ebd - d\u0115''||''\u0294wa''\n|-\n| ||2||SN||DUAL||EMP||one||fish||2||POT||3 \u2013 eat \u2013 NZR||DUAL\n|}\n:\"You (both) eat one fish.\"\n\nHowever, when the dual is not optional in the clause, only the reduplicated \u0294wa\u0294wa occurs, at the end of the clause, as here:\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u2205''||''te''||''\u0294ai - wawa - j''||''\u0294wa\u02d0\u0294wa''\n|-\n| ||2||POT||2 -   cry -    NZR||DUAL\n|}\n:\"You are both crying.\"\n\nFinally, third person dual is also denoted similarly depending on whether the argument is in the subject or object position. For the former, the morpheme dzahur\u025b is placed clause-finally, and denotes \u2018They both\u2019, as seen here:\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u0294\u00f5''||''d\u00f5r\u0129''||''\u0294i-ts-i-       oto''||''dzahur\u025b'' \n|-\n| ||3||NS||3-R-MED-bent||DUAL\n|}\n:\"They are both bent.\"\n\nHowever, when the third person dual is in the object position, the same morpheme, dzahur\u025b, is also used, as in the following example:\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u0294\u00f5''||''d\u00f5r\u0129''||''h\u00e3''||''\u2205''||''te''||''dza''||''\u2205- \u0294atsabr\u00f5''||''dzahur\u025b''\n|-\n| ||3||NS||EMP||3||POT||PROJ||3-run||DUAL\n|}\n:\"Both of them will run.\"\n\nIn all, the dual marks all arguments in Xavante, and differentiates between first, second, and third person in subject and object positions.\n\nPlurals in Xavante, in which more than two arguments are described, is expressed using its own variations of morphemes. In the first person and third person, dza\u0294ra is used clause-finally, as here:\n\n {|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u0294wa''||''d\u00f5r\u0129''||''\u0294iwa - dz -      \u0129 - oto''||''dza\u0294ra''\n|-\n| ||1||NS||1-   R||MED- bent||PLURAL\n|}\n:\"We are all bent.\"\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u0294\u00f5''||''d\u00f5r\u0129''||''\u0294i-ts-i-       oto''||''dza\u0294ra'' \n| ||3||NS||3-R-MED- bent||PLURAL\n|}\n:\"They are all bent.\"\n\nHowever, the second person plural is expressed differently, with the previous morpheme, dza\u0294ra, being combined with \u0294wa\u0294wa in two positions, clause-medially after the initial person marker and clause-finally, as here:\n\n{|border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||''\u0294a''||''d\u00f5r\u0129''||''\u0294wa\u0294wa''||''\u0294aj -rare''||''dza\u0294ra''||''\u0294wa\u0294wa''\n|-\n| ||2||NS||DUAL||2-   small||PLURAL||DUAL\n|}\n:\"They are all small.\"\n\nIn all, the plural in Xavante is expressed with less variation than in the dual, but nonetheless is always important to marking quantity of human subjects in the first, second, and third person.\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n*McLeod, Ruth & Mitchell, Valerie.

However, Nahuan languages are currently no longer spoken in Guatemala.\n\n==Nawat and Nahuatl compared==\n\n{{main|Nawat grammar}}\n\n===Phonology===\nTwo salient features of Nawat are found in several Mexican dialects: the change of [t\u0361\u026c] to [t] and [u] rather than [o] as the predominant [[allophone]] of a single basic rounded vowel phoneme. These features are thus characteristic but not diagnostic.\n\nHowever, Nawat {{IPA|/t/}} corresponds to not only the two Classical Nahuatl sounds {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/t\u0361\u026c/}} but also a word final ''saltillo'' or [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|/\u0294/}} in nominal plural suffixes (e.g. Nawat ''-met'' : Classical ''-meh'') and verbal plural endings (Nawat ''-t'' present plural, ''-ket'' past plural, etc.). This fact has been claimed by Campbell to be diagnostic for the position of Nawat in a genetic classification, on the assumption that this /t/ is more archaic than the Classical Nahuatl reflex, where the direction change has been {{IPA|/t/}} > {{IPA|/\u0294/}} ''saltillo''.\n\nOne other characteristic phonological feature is the merger in Nawat of original geminate {{IPA|/ll/}} with single {{IPA|/l/}}.\n\n===Grammar===\n{{main|Nawat grammar}}\nNawat lacks some grammatical features present in Classical Nahuatl, such as the past prefix ''o-'' in verbs. It distributes others differently: for example, 'subtractive' past formation, which is very common in the classical language, exists in Nawat but is much rarer. On the other hand, [[reduplication]] to form plural nouns, of more limited distribution in the language of the Aztecs, is greatly generalised in Nawat. Still other grammatical features that were productive in Classical Nahuatl have left only fossilised traces in Nawat: for example, synchronically Nawat has no [[postposition]]s, although a few lexical forms derive etymologically from older postpositional forms, e.g. ''apan'' 'river' < *'in/on the water', ''kujtan'' 'uncultivated land, forest' < *'under the trees'; these are synchronically unanalyzable in modern Nawat.\n\n===Noun phrase===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ Comparison: Noun phrase\n! align=\"center\"|\n! align=\"center\"|Nahuatl\n! align=\"center\"|Nawat\n! align=\"center\"|Nawat example\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|plural marking\n| align=\"center\"|limited in Classical\n| align=\"center\"|generalized\n|rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"|''taj-tamal'' 'tortillas'\n\n''sej-selek'' 'tender, fresh (pl.)'\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|plural formation\n| align=\"center\"|mostly suffixes\n| align=\"center\"|mostly redup.\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|absolute ''-tli'' (Nawat ''-ti'')\n| align=\"center\"|generally kept\n| align=\"center\"|often absent\n| align=\"center\"|''mistun'' 'cat (abs.)'\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|construct /C_\n| align=\"center\"|''-wi'' or zero\n| align=\"center\"|always zero\n| align=\"center\"|''nu-uj'' 'my path'\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|inalienability\n| align=\"center\"|nouns generally have absolutes\n| align=\"center\"|many inalienables\n| align=\"center\"|*''mey-ti'', *''nan-ti''...\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|possessive prefixes\n| align=\"center\"|lose ''o'' before vowel\n| align=\"center\"|retain vowel (''u'')\n| align=\"center\"|''nu-ikaw'' 'my brother'\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|articles\n| align=\"center\"|no generalized articles in Classical\n| align=\"center\"|definite ''ne'', indefinite ''se''\n| align=\"center\"|''ne/se takat'' 'the/a man'\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|post/prepositions\n| align=\"center\"|postpositions\n| align=\"center\"|no post-, only prepositions\n| align=\"center\"|''tik ne apan'' 'in the river'\n|}\nNawat has developed two widely used [[Article (grammar)|article]]s, [[definite article|definite]] ''ne'' and [[indefinite article|indefinite]] ''se''. The [[demonstrative]] pronouns/determiners ''ini'' 'this, these' and ''uni'' 'that, those' are also distinctively Nawat in form. The obligatory marking of [[grammatical number|number]] extends in Nawat to almost all [[plural]] [[noun phrase]]s (regardless of [[animacy]]), which will contain at least one plural form, most commonly marked by [[reduplication]].\n\nMany nouns are invariable for [[construct state|state]], since ''-ti'' (cf. Classical ''-tli'', the absolute suffix after consonants) is rarely added to polysyllabic noun stems, while the Classical postconsonantal construct suffix, ''-wi'', is altogether unknown in Nawat: thus ''sin-ti'' 'maize' : ''nu-sin'' 'my maize', ''uj-ti'' 'way' : ''nu-uj'' 'my way', ''mistun'' 'cat' : ''nu-mistun'' 'my cat'.\n\nAn important number of nouns lack absolute forms and occur only [[Possession (linguistics)|inalienably]] possessed, e.g. ''nu-mey'' 'my hand' (but not *''mey'' or *''mey-ti''), ''nu-nan'' 'my mother' (but not *''nan'' or *''nan-ti''), thus further reducing the number of absolute-construct oppositions and the incidence of absolute ''-ti'' in comparison to Classical Nahuatl.\n\n[[Postposition]]s have been eliminated from the Pipil grammatical system, and some monosyllabic [[preposition]]s originating from [[relational noun|relational]]s have become [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]].\n\n===Verbs===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ Comparison: Verb\n! align=\"center\"|\n! align=\"center\"|Nahuatl\n! align=\"center\"|Nawat\n! align=\"center\"|Nawat example\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|inflection\n| align=\"center\"|more complex\n| align=\"center\"|less complex; analytic substitutes\n| align=\"center\"|''kuchi nemi katka'' 'used to stay and sleep'\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|past prefix ''o-''\n| align=\"center\"|found in Classical + some dialects\n| align=\"center\"|no\n|rowspan=\"3\" align=\"center\"|''ki-neki-k'' 'he wanted it'\n\n''ni-kuch-ki'' 'I slept'\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|subtractive past formation\n| align=\"center\"|common in Classical + some dialects\n| align=\"center\"|limited\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|past in ''-ki''\n| align=\"center\"|no\n| align=\"center\"|yes\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|perfect in ''-tuk''\n| align=\"center\"|no\n| align=\"center\"|yes\n| align=\"center\"|''ni-kuch-tuk'' 'I have slept'\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|imperfect\n| align=\"center\"|''-ya''\n| align=\"center\"|''-tuya'' (stative)\n| align=\"center\"|''ni-weli-tuya'' 'I could'\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|''-skia'', ''-tuskia'' conditionals\n| align=\"center\"|no\n| align=\"center\"|yes\n| align=\"center\"|''ni-takwika-(tu)-skia'' 'I would sing/I would have sung'\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|initial prefixes /_V\n| align=\"center\"|lose ''i''\n| align=\"center\"|mostly retain ''i''\n| align=\"center\"|''niajsi'' 'I arrive',\n\n''kielkawa'' 'he forgets it'\n|}\n\nTo form the [[past tense]], most Nawat verbs add ''-k'' (after vowels) or ''-ki'' (after consonants, following loss of the final vowel of the present stem), e.g. ''ki-neki'' 'he wants it' : ''ki-neki-k'' 'he wanted it', ''ki-mati'' 'he knows it' : ''ki-mat-ki'' 'he knew it'. The mechanism of simply removing the present stem vowel to form past stems, so common in Classical Nahuatl, is limited in Nawat to polysyllabic verb stems such as ''ki-talia'' 'he puts it' \u2192 ''ki-tali(j)'' 'he put it', ''mu-talua'' 'he runs' \u2192 ''mu-talu(j)'' 'he ran', and a handful of other verbs, e.g. ''ki-tajtani'' 'he asks him' \u2192 ''ki-tajtan'' 'he asked him'.\n\nNawat has a [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] in ''-tuk'' (synchronically unanalyzable), plural ''-tiwit''. Another tense suffix, ''-tuya'', functions both as a [[pluperfect]] (''k-itz-tuya ne takat'' 'he had seen the man') and as an [[imperfect]] of [[stative]] verbs (''inte weli-tuya'' 'he couldn't'), in the latter case having supplanted the ''-ya'' imperfect found in Mexican dialects.\n\nNawat has two [[Conditional mood|conditional]] tenses, one in ''-skia'' expressing possible conditions and possible results, and one in ''-tuskia'' for impossible ones, although the distinction is sometimes blurred in practice. A [[future tense]] in ''-s'' (plural ''-sket'') is attested but rarely used, a [[periphrastic]] future being preferred, e.g. ''yawi witz'' (or ''yu-witz'') 'he will come'.\n\nIn [[serial verb|serial]] constructions, the [[present tense]] (really the [[markedness|unmarked]] tense) is generally found except in the first verb, regardless of the tense of the latter, e.g. ''kineki / kinekik / kinekiskia kikwa'' 'he wants / wanted / would like to eat it'.\n\nThere are also some differences regarding how [[prefix]]es are attached to verb-initial stems; principally, that in Nawat the prefixes ''ni-'', ''ti-'', ''shi-'' and ''ki-'' when word-initial retain their ''i'' in most cases, e.g. ''ni-ajsi'' 'I arrive', ''ki-elkawa'' 'he forgets it'.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|El Salvador|Central America|Languages}}\n*[[Cuzcatlan]]\n*[[Pipil people]]\n*[[Nawat language (typological overview)]]\n*[[Nawat grammar]]\n*[[Nahuatl]]\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Asociaci\u00f3n Coordinadora de Comunidades Ind\u00edgenas de El Salvador (ACCIES) (no date).

It has been on the verge of extinction in El Salvador and has already gone extinct elsewhere in Central America, but as of 2012 new second language speakers are starting to appear.\n\nIn El Salvador, Nawat was the language of several groups: [[Nonualcos]], [[Cuscatlecos]], [[Izalcos]] and is known to be the N\u00e1hua variety of migrating [[Toltec]]. The name ''Pipil'' for this language is used by the international scholarly community, chiefly to differentiate it more clearly from [[Nahuatl]]. In this article the name ''Nawat'' will be used whenever there is no risk of ambiguity.\n\n==Status==\nMost authors refer to this language by the names ''Nawat'' or ''Pipil''. However, ''Nawat'' (along with the synonymous ''Eastern Nahuatl'') has also been used to refer to Nahuatl [[Variety (linguistics)|language varieties]] in southern [[Veracruz]], [[Tabasco]], and [[Chiapas]], states in the south of Mexico, that like Pipil have reduced the earlier /t\u0361\u026c/ consonant (a lateral [[affricate]]) to a /t/.<ref>Ligorred, E: ''Lenguas Ind\u00edgenas de M\u00e9xico y Centroam\u00e9rica''</ref> Those Mexican [[lect]]s share more similarities with Nawat than do the other Nahuatl varieties.\n\nPipil specialists ([[Lyle Campbell|Campbell]], Fidias Jim\u00e9nez, [[Pedro Geoffroy Rivas|Geoffroy Rivas]], [[Alan R. King|King]], [[Jorge Ernesto Lemus|Lemus]], and Schultze, ''inter alia'') generally treat Pipil/Nawat as a separate language, at least in practice. [[Yolanda Lastra|Lastra de Su\u00e1rez]] (1986) and [[Una Canger|Canger]] (1988) classify Pipil among \"Eastern Periphery\" dialects of Nahuatl.\n\n==Classification==\n(Campbell 1985)\n*Uto-Aztecan\n**Southern Uto-Aztecan\n***Nahuan (Aztecan, Nahuatlan)\n****Pochutec ''(extinct)''\n****General Aztec\n*****Core Nahua\n*****Pipil\n\nUto-Aztecan is uncontroversially divided into eight branches, including Nahuan.

However, Nahuan languages are currently no longer spoken in Guatemala.\n\n==Nawat and Nahuatl compared==\n\n{{main|Nawat grammar}}\n\n===Phonology===\nTwo salient features of Nawat are found in several Mexican dialects: the change of [t\u0361\u026c] to [t] and [u] rather than [o] as the predominant [[allophone]] of a single basic rounded vowel phoneme. These features are thus characteristic but not diagnostic.\n\nHowever, Nawat {{IPA|/t/}} corresponds to not only the two Classical Nahuatl sounds {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/t\u0361\u026c/}} but also a word final ''saltillo'' or [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|/\u0294/}} in nominal plural suffixes (e.g. Nawat ''-met'' : Classical ''-meh'') and verbal plural endings (Nawat ''-t'' present plural, ''-ket'' past plural, etc.). This fact has been claimed by Campbell to be diagnostic for the position of Nawat in a genetic classification, on the assumption that this /t/ is more archaic than the Classical Nahuatl reflex, where the direction change has been {{IPA|/t/}} > {{IPA|/\u0294/}} ''saltillo''.\n\nOne other characteristic phonological feature is the merger in Nawat of original geminate {{IPA|/ll/}} with single {{IPA|/l/}}.\n\n===Grammar===\n{{main|Nawat grammar}}\nNawat lacks some grammatical features present in Classical Nahuatl, such as the past prefix ''o-'' in verbs. It distributes others differently: for example, 'subtractive' past formation, which is very common in the classical language, exists in Nawat but is much rarer. On the other hand, [[reduplication]] to form plural nouns, of more limited distribution in the language of the Aztecs, is greatly generalised in Nawat. Still other grammatical features that were productive in Classical Nahuatl have left only fossilised traces in Nawat: for example, synchronically Nawat has no [[postposition]]s, although a few lexical forms derive etymologically from older postpositional forms, e.g. ''apan'' 'river' < *'in/on the water', ''kujtan'' 'uncultivated land, forest' < *'under the trees'; these are synchronically unanalyzable in modern Nawat.\n\n===Noun phrase===\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ Comparison: Noun phrase\n! align=\"center\"|\n! align=\"center\"|Nahuatl\n! align=\"center\"|Nawat\n! align=\"center\"|Nawat example\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|plural marking\n| align=\"center\"|limited in Classical\n| align=\"center\"|generalized\n|rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"|''taj-tamal'' 'tortillas'\n\n''sej-selek'' 'tender, fresh (pl.)'\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|plural formation\n| align=\"center\"|mostly suffixes\n| align=\"center\"|mostly redup.\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|absolute ''-tli'' (Nawat ''-ti'')\n| align=\"center\"|generally kept\n| align=\"center\"|often absent\n| align=\"center\"|''mistun'' 'cat (abs.)'\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|construct /C_\n| align=\"center\"|''-wi'' or zero\n| align=\"center\"|always zero\n| align=\"center\"|''nu-uj'' 'my path'\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|inalienability\n| align=\"center\"|nouns generally have absolutes\n| align=\"center\"|many inalienables\n| align=\"center\"|*''mey-ti'', *''nan-ti''...\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|possessive prefixes\n| align=\"center\"|lose ''o'' before vowel\n| align=\"center\"|retain vowel (''u'')\n| align=\"center\"|''nu-ikaw'' 'my brother'\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|articles\n| align=\"center\"|no generalized articles in Classical\n| align=\"center\"|definite ''ne'', indefinite ''se''\n| align=\"center\"|''ne/se takat'' 'the/a man'\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|post/prepositions\n| align=\"center\"|postpositions\n| align=\"center\"|no post-, only prepositions\n| align=\"center\"|''tik ne apan'' 'in the river'\n|}\nNawat has developed two widely used [[Article (grammar)|article]]s, [[definite article|definite]] ''ne'' and [[indefinite article|indefinite]] ''se''. The [[demonstrative]] pronouns/determiners ''ini'' 'this, these' and ''uni'' 'that, those' are also distinctively Nawat in form. The obligatory marking of [[grammatical number|number]] extends in Nawat to almost all [[plural]] [[noun phrase]]s (regardless of [[animacy]]), which will contain at least one plural form, most commonly marked by [[reduplication]].\n\nMany nouns are invariable for [[construct state|state]], since ''-ti'' (cf. Classical ''-tli'', the absolute suffix after consonants) is rarely added to polysyllabic noun stems, while the Classical postconsonantal construct suffix, ''-wi'', is altogether unknown in Nawat: thus ''sin-ti'' 'maize' : ''nu-sin'' 'my maize', ''uj-ti'' 'way' : ''nu-uj'' 'my way', ''mistun'' 'cat' : ''nu-mistun'' 'my cat'.\n\nAn important number of nouns lack absolute forms and occur only [[Possession (linguistics)|inalienably]] possessed, e.g. ''nu-mey'' 'my hand' (but not *''mey'' or *''mey-ti''), ''nu-nan'' 'my mother' (but not *''nan'' or *''nan-ti''), thus further reducing the number of absolute-construct oppositions and the incidence of absolute ''-ti'' in comparison to Classical Nahuatl.\n\n[[Postposition]]s have been eliminated from the Pipil grammatical system, and some monosyllabic [[preposition]]s originating from [[relational noun|relational]]s have become [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]].\n\n===Verbs===\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ Comparison: Verb\n! align=\"center\"|\n! align=\"center\"|Nahuatl\n! align=\"center\"|Nawat\n! align=\"center\"|Nawat example\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|inflection\n| align=\"center\"|more complex\n| align=\"center\"|less complex; analytic substitutes\n| align=\"center\"|''kuchi nemi katka'' 'used to stay and sleep'\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|past prefix ''o-''\n| align=\"center\"|found in Classical + some dialects\n| align=\"center\"|no\n|rowspan=\"3\" align=\"center\"|''ki-neki-k'' 'he wanted it'\n\n''ni-kuch-ki'' 'I slept'\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|subtractive past formation\n| align=\"center\"|common in Classical + some dialects\n| align=\"center\"|limited\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|past in ''-ki''\n| align=\"center\"|no\n| align=\"center\"|yes\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|perfect in ''-tuk''\n| align=\"center\"|no\n| align=\"center\"|yes\n| align=\"center\"|''ni-kuch-tuk'' 'I have slept'\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|imperfect\n| align=\"center\"|''-ya''\n| align=\"center\"|''-tuya'' (stative)\n| align=\"center\"|''ni-weli-tuya'' 'I could'\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|''-skia'', ''-tuskia'' conditionals\n| align=\"center\"|no\n| align=\"center\"|yes\n| align=\"center\"|''ni-takwika-(tu)-skia'' 'I would sing/I would have sung'\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|initial prefixes /_V\n| align=\"center\"|lose ''i''\n| align=\"center\"|mostly retain ''i''\n| align=\"center\"|''niajsi'' 'I arrive',\n\n''kielkawa'' 'he forgets it'\n|}\n\nTo form the [[past tense]], most Nawat verbs add ''-k'' (after vowels) or ''-ki'' (after consonants, following loss of the final vowel of the present stem), e.g. ''ki-neki'' 'he wants it' : ''ki-neki-k'' 'he wanted it', ''ki-mati'' 'he knows it' : ''ki-mat-ki'' 'he knew it'. The mechanism of simply removing the present stem vowel to form past stems, so common in Classical Nahuatl, is limited in Nawat to polysyllabic verb stems such as ''ki-talia'' 'he puts it' \u2192 ''ki-tali(j)'' 'he put it', ''mu-talua'' 'he runs' \u2192 ''mu-talu(j)'' 'he ran', and a handful of other verbs, e.g. ''ki-tajtani'' 'he asks him' \u2192 ''ki-tajtan'' 'he asked him'.\n\nNawat has a [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] in ''-tuk'' (synchronically unanalyzable), plural ''-tiwit''. Another tense suffix, ''-tuya'', functions both as a [[pluperfect]] (''k-itz-tuya ne takat'' 'he had seen the man') and as an [[imperfect]] of [[stative]] verbs (''inte weli-tuya'' 'he couldn't'), in the latter case having supplanted the ''-ya'' imperfect found in Mexican dialects.\n\nNawat has two [[Conditional mood|conditional]] tenses, one in ''-skia'' expressing possible conditions and possible results, and one in ''-tuskia'' for impossible ones, although the distinction is sometimes blurred in practice. A [[future tense]] in ''-s'' (plural ''-sket'') is attested but rarely used, a [[periphrastic]] future being preferred, e.g. ''yawi witz'' (or ''yu-witz'') 'he will come'.\n\nIn [[serial verb|serial]] constructions, the [[present tense]] (really the [[markedness|unmarked]] tense) is generally found except in the first verb, regardless of the tense of the latter, e.g. ''kineki / kinekik / kinekiskia kikwa'' 'he wants / wanted / would like to eat it'.\n\nThere are also some differences regarding how [[prefix]]es are attached to verb-initial stems; principally, that in Nawat the prefixes ''ni-'', ''ti-'', ''shi-'' and ''ki-'' when word-initial retain their ''i'' in most cases, e.g. ''ni-ajsi'' 'I arrive', ''ki-elkawa'' 'he forgets it'.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|El Salvador|Central America|Languages}}\n*[[Cuzcatlan]]\n*[[Pipil people]]\n*[[Nawat language (typological overview)]]\n*[[Nawat grammar]]\n*[[Nahuatl]]\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Asociaci\u00f3n Coordinadora de Comunidades Ind\u00edgenas de El Salvador (ACCIES) (no date).

The low tone, however, only appears in word-final position on the vowel {{IPA|a}}. A falling tone (high-mid) appears on word-final syllables only. Joswig<ref>Joswig (2009)</ref> reanalyzes the system as having only two distinctive tone levels, with the low tone being a phonetic variant of the mid tone.\n\n===Syllable structure===\nThe Awngi syllable in most cases fits the maximum syllable template CVC (C standing for a consonant, V for a vowel). This means there is only one (if any) consonant each in the [[syllable onset]] and the [[rhyme]]. Exceptions to this happen at word boundaries, where [[extrametricality|extrametrical]] consonants may appear.\n\n===Phonological processes===\n====Gemination====\nIn positions other than word-initial, Awngi contrasts [[gemination|geminate]] and non-geminate consonants. The contrast between geminate and non-geminate consonants does not show up for the following consonants: {{IPA|/\u0262, \u0262\u02b7, t\u0361s, t\u0361\u0283, j, w, \u0292/}}.\n\n====Vowel harmony====\nWhenever a suffix containing the [+high] vowel {{IPA|i}} is added to a stem, a productive vowel harmony process is triggered. [[Robert Hetzron|Hetzron]] calls this process regressive vowel height [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]]. The vowel harmony only takes place if the underlying vowel of the last stem syllable is {{IPA|e}}. This vowel and all preceding instances of {{IPA|e}} and {{IPA|o}} will take over the [[distinctive feature|feature]] [+high], until a different vowel is encountered. Then the vowel harmony is blocked. Hetzron<ref>Hetzron (1997), p. 485</ref> provides the following example: /moleq\u00e9s-\u00e1/ \u2018nun\u2019 vs. /muliq\u00eds-\u00ed/ \u2018monk\u2019\n\n==Orthography==\nAwngi is used as Medium of Instruction from Grade 1 to 6 in primary schools of [[Agew Awi Zone|Awi Zone]]. It is written with an orthography based on the Ethiopian Script. Extra [[Ge'ez abugida|fidel]]s used for Awngi are \u131d for the sound {{IPA|\u014b}} and \u1255 for the sound {{IPA|q}}. The fidel \u1345 is used for {{IPA|ts}}, the fidel \u12bd for the sound {{IPA|\u0262}}. Various aspects of the Awngi orthography are yet to be finally decided.\n\n==Morphology==\n===The Noun<ref>Hetzron (1978)</ref>===\nThe noun is marked for [[Grammatical number|number]]-cum-[[Grammatical gender|gender]] ([[masculine]], [[Grammatical gender|feminine]] or [[plural]]) and [[Grammatical case|case]]. The nominative is unmarked for one class of nouns, or marked by -i for masculine nouns and -a for feminine nouns. Other cases are [[accusative]], [[dative]], [[genitive]], [[locative]], directional, [[ablative]], [[comitative]], [[comparative]], invocative and [[translative]]. Hetzron<ref>Hetzron (1978), p.125 ff</ref> also mentions adverbial as a case of Awngi, but an interpretation as a [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivation]]al marker seems to be more appropriate. Both number-cum-gender and case are marked through [[suffix]]es to the noun stems.\n\n===The Verb<ref>Hetzron (1969)</ref>===\nThe Awngi verbal morphology has a wealth of [[inflection]]al forms. The four main [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] are [[imperfective]] past, imperfective non-past, [[perfective]] past and perfective non-past. There are various other coordinate and subordinate forms which are all marked through suffixes to the verb stems. The following distinctions are maintained for Person: 1sg, 2sg, 3masc, 3fem, 1pl, 2pl, 3pl.\nHetzron demonstrated that the Awngi verbal morphology is most economically described when it is assumed that for every verb there are four distinct stems: The first stem is for 3masc, 2pl, 3pl. The second stem is for 1sg only, the third stem for 2sg and 3fem, and the fourth stem for 1pl only. These four stems need to be noted for every verb in the [[lexicon]] and serve as the basis for all other verbal morphology. The stems remain the same throughout all verbal paradigms, and it is possible to predict the surface form of each [[paradigm]] member with these stems and the simple tense suffixes.\n\n==Syntax==\nThe main verb of a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] is always at the end. The basic word order is therefore SOV. Subordination and coordination is achieved exclusively through verbal affixation.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* Appleyard, David L.

The low tone, however, only appears in word-final position on the vowel {{IPA|a}}. A falling tone (high-mid) appears on word-final syllables only. Joswig<ref>Joswig (2009)</ref> reanalyzes the system as having only two distinctive tone levels, with the low tone being a phonetic variant of the mid tone.\n\n===Syllable structure===\nThe Awngi syllable in most cases fits the maximum syllable template CVC (C standing for a consonant, V for a vowel). This means there is only one (if any) consonant each in the [[syllable onset]] and the [[rhyme]]. Exceptions to this happen at word boundaries, where [[extrametricality|extrametrical]] consonants may appear.\n\n===Phonological processes===\n====Gemination====\nIn positions other than word-initial, Awngi contrasts [[gemination|geminate]] and non-geminate consonants. The contrast between geminate and non-geminate consonants does not show up for the following consonants: {{IPA|/\u0262, \u0262\u02b7, t\u0361s, t\u0361\u0283, j, w, \u0292/}}.\n\n====Vowel harmony====\nWhenever a suffix containing the [+high] vowel {{IPA|i}} is added to a stem, a productive vowel harmony process is triggered. [[Robert Hetzron|Hetzron]] calls this process regressive vowel height [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]]. The vowel harmony only takes place if the underlying vowel of the last stem syllable is {{IPA|e}}. This vowel and all preceding instances of {{IPA|e}} and {{IPA|o}} will take over the [[distinctive feature|feature]] [+high], until a different vowel is encountered. Then the vowel harmony is blocked. Hetzron<ref>Hetzron (1997), p. 485</ref> provides the following example: /moleq\u00e9s-\u00e1/ \u2018nun\u2019 vs. /muliq\u00eds-\u00ed/ \u2018monk\u2019\n\n==Orthography==\nAwngi is used as Medium of Instruction from Grade 1 to 6 in primary schools of [[Agew Awi Zone|Awi Zone]]. It is written with an orthography based on the Ethiopian Script. Extra [[Ge'ez abugida|fidel]]s used for Awngi are \u131d for the sound {{IPA|\u014b}} and \u1255 for the sound {{IPA|q}}. The fidel \u1345 is used for {{IPA|ts}}, the fidel \u12bd for the sound {{IPA|\u0262}}. Various aspects of the Awngi orthography are yet to be finally decided.\n\n==Morphology==\n===The Noun<ref>Hetzron (1978)</ref>===\nThe noun is marked for [[Grammatical number|number]]-cum-[[Grammatical gender|gender]] ([[masculine]], [[Grammatical gender|feminine]] or [[plural]]) and [[Grammatical case|case]]. The nominative is unmarked for one class of nouns, or marked by -i for masculine nouns and -a for feminine nouns. Other cases are [[accusative]], [[dative]], [[genitive]], [[locative]], directional, [[ablative]], [[comitative]], [[comparative]], invocative and [[translative]]. Hetzron<ref>Hetzron (1978), p.125 ff</ref> also mentions adverbial as a case of Awngi, but an interpretation as a [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivation]]al marker seems to be more appropriate. Both number-cum-gender and case are marked through [[suffix]]es to the noun stems.\n\n===The Verb<ref>Hetzron (1969)</ref>===\nThe Awngi verbal morphology has a wealth of [[inflection]]al forms. The four main [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] are [[imperfective]] past, imperfective non-past, [[perfective]] past and perfective non-past. There are various other coordinate and subordinate forms which are all marked through suffixes to the verb stems. The following distinctions are maintained for Person: 1sg, 2sg, 3masc, 3fem, 1pl, 2pl, 3pl.\nHetzron demonstrated that the Awngi verbal morphology is most economically described when it is assumed that for every verb there are four distinct stems: The first stem is for 3masc, 2pl, 3pl. The second stem is for 1sg only, the third stem for 2sg and 3fem, and the fourth stem for 1pl only. These four stems need to be noted for every verb in the [[lexicon]] and serve as the basis for all other verbal morphology. The stems remain the same throughout all verbal paradigms, and it is possible to predict the surface form of each [[paradigm]] member with these stems and the simple tense suffixes.\n\n==Syntax==\nThe main verb of a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] is always at the end. The basic word order is therefore SOV. Subordination and coordination is achieved exclusively through verbal affixation.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* Appleyard, David L.

During the subsequent centuries, it was largely displaced by [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and evolved into some of the modern [[Nahuan languages]] in use today (other modern dialects descend more directly from other 16th-century variants). Although classified as an [[extinct language]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=nci |title=Ethnologue summary for Classical Nahuatl |access-date=2006-06-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218111931/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=nci |archive-date=2013-02-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Classical Nahuatl has survived through a multitude of written sources transcribed by [[Nahua peoples]] and Spaniards in the [[Latin script]].\n\n==Classification==\nClassical Nahuatl is one of the [[Nahuan languages]] within the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan family]]. It is classified as a central dialect and is most closely related to the modern dialects of Nahuatl spoken in the valley of Mexico in colonial and modern times. It is probable that the Classical Nahuatl documented by 16th- and 17th-century written sources represents a particularly prestigious [[sociolect]]. That is to say, the variety of Nahuatl recorded in these documents is most likely to be more particularly representative of the speech of Aztec nobles (''[[pipiltin|p\u012bpiltin]]''), while the commoners (''[[Macehualtin|m\u0101c\u0113hualtin]]'') spoke a somewhat different variety.\n\n==Phonology==\n\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! align=\"center\"|[[Front vowel|Front]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|[[Close vowel|Close]]\n| align=\"center\"|{{IPA|i, i\u02d0}}\n|rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"|{{IPA|o, o\u02d0}}\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|[[Mid vowel|Mid]]\n| align=\"center\"|{{IPA|e, e\u02d0}}\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|[[Open vowel|Open]]\n|colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"|{{IPA|a, a\u02d0}}\n|}\n\n===Consonants===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"|\n! rowspan=\"2\"|[[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n! colspan=\"2\"|[[Dental consonant|Dental]]\n! rowspan=\"2\"|[[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! colspan=\"2\"|[[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n! rowspan=\"2\"|[[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-align=center\n!<small>[[central consonant|central]]</small>\n!<small>[[lateral consonant|lateral]]</small>\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[labialization|labial]]</small>\n|-align=center\n!

[[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n| \n|\n| {{IPA|l}}\n| {{IPA|j}}\n|\n| {{IPA|w}}\n|\n|}\n\n===Accent===\n[[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] generally falls on the penultimate syllable. The one exception is the [[vocative case]].{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} When used by men it has the suffix '''-e''', where stress falls on the final syllable, e.g. '''Cu\u0101uhtli<u>quetz</u>qui''' (a name, meaning \"[[eagle warrior|Eagle Warrior]]\"), but '''Cu\u0101uhtliquetz<u>qu\u00e9</u>''' \"O Cuauhtliquetzqui!\"\nWhen women use the vocative, the stress is shifted to the final syllable without adding any suffix.\n\"Oquichtli\" means \"man\", and \"Oquichtl\u00ed\" means \"O man!\"\n\n===Phonotactics===\nMaximally complex Nahuatl syllables are of the form CVC; that is, there can be at most one consonant at the beginning and end of every syllable. In contrast, [[English language|English]], for example, allows up to three consonants syllable-initially and up to four  [[consonant]]s to occur at the end of syllables (e.g. ''<u>str</u>e<u>ngths</u>)'' (''ngths'' = {{IPA|/\u014bk\u03b8s/}}). Consonant clusters are only allowed word-medially, Nahuatl uses processes of both epenthesis (usually of /i/) and deletion to deal with this constraint.\n\nFor such purposes, ''tl'' {{IPA|/t\u026c/}}, like all other affricates, is treated as a single sound, and not all consonants can occur in both syllable-initial and syllable-final position.\n\n==Grammar==\n{{main|Classical Nahuatl grammar}}\n\n==Writing system==\n{{main|Nahuatl orthography}}\nAt the time of the Spanish conquest, Aztec writing used mostly [[pictogram]]s supplemented with a few [[ideogram]]s. When needed, it also used syllabic equivalences{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}; [[Diego Dur\u00e1n]] recorded how the ''tlacuilos'' could render a prayer in [[Latin]] using this system but it was difficult to use. The writing system was adequate for keeping such records as genealogies, astronomical information, and tribute lists, but it could not represent a full vocabulary of spoken language in the way that the [[writing system]]s of the [[Old World]] or the [[Maya civilization]]'s [[Maya script|script]] could.\n\nThe Spanish introduced the [[Latin script]], which was then used to record a large body of Aztec prose and poetry, which somewhat diminished the devastating loss caused by the burning of thousands of [[Aztec codices]] by the Spanish authorities.\n\nOn the [[:nah:|Nahuatl edition of Wikipedia]], the language is written in a Latin script, including four [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] with [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]]s or long vowels: [[\u0101]], [[\u0113]], [[\u012b]], [[\u014d]]. Many other foreign letters such as ''b'' or ''k'' are used only in foreign names, such as in Francitl\u0101n ([[France]]).\n\nThe orthography used there is outlined below:\n<big><center>'''a c ch cu e hu i l* m n o p qu t tl tz x y z \u0101 \u0113 \u012b \u014d ll* h*'''</center></big>\nNotes:\n*Letters above marked with an asterisk (*) have no capital forms except in foreign names.\n*Like in Spanish, {{IPA|/k/}} is written as {{angbr|c}}, except before {{angbr|i}} or {{angbr|e}} in which case {{angbr|qu}} is used. Likewise, {{IPA|/s/}} is written as {{angbr|z}}, except before {{angbr|i}} or {{angbr|e}}, in which case {{angbr|c}} is used. However, {{IPA|/ts/}} is always written as {{angbr|tz}}.\n** The Classical Nahuatl {{IPA|/s/}} was likely substantially different from the normal Spanish ''s'' [[Early Modern Spanish|of the time]], a [[Voiceless alveolar fricative#Voiceless alveolar sibilant|voiceless retracted apico-alveolar sibilant fricative]] {{IPA|/s\u033a/}} (still the norm in modern northern [[Peninsular Spanish]]; the sound may be perceived by an English speaker as some sort of cross between {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/\u0283/}}). It was far more similar to the normal Spanish ''z'' of that time period: {{IPA|/s\u033b/}}, a voiceless laminal alveolar sibilant fricative, like the typical English {{IPA|/s/}}. This would explain why {{angbr|z}} and {{angbr|c}} were used instead of {{angbr|s}} to write the sound.\n*{{angbr|x}} is used for the sh-sound {{IPA|/\u0283/}}, as in Early Modern Spanish.\n*{{angbr|cu}} and {{angbr|hu}}, which represent {{IPA|/k\u02b7/}} and {{IPA|/w/}} respectively, are inverted to {{angbr|uc}} and {{angbr|uh}} at the end of a syllable.\n** The letter {{angbr|u}} is used only in digraphs, as the Nahuatl language lacks an {{IPA|/u/}}, distinct from {{IPA|/o/}}.\n*{{angbr|h}} represents a glottal stop, a sort of pause caused by constricting the throat, as in ''uh-oh''.\n\n==Literature==\n[[Mesoamerican literature|Nahuatl literature]] is extensive (probably the most extensive of all Indigenous languages of the Americas), including a relatively large corpus of [[poetry]] (see also [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]]). The ''[[Huei tlamahui\u00e7oltica]]'' is an excellent early sample of literary Nahuatl.\n\nA [[bilingual]] dictionary with Spanish was first published in 1611, ''[[Vocabulario manual de las lenguas castellana y mexicana]]'' and is \"the most important and most frequently reprinted Spanish work on Nahuatl,\" according to the [[World Digital Library]].<ref>{{Cite web| title = Manual Vocabulary of the Spanish and Mexican Languages: In Which are Contained the Words, Questions, and Answers Commonly and Usually Found in the Treatment and Communication Between Spaniards and Indians | work = [[World Digital Library]] | accessdate = 2013-05-23 | url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2836/}}</ref>\n\nNow, Classical Nahuatl is used by [[black metal]] groups of [[Mexico]] supporting ''[[indigenismo]]'', such as Kukulcan, Tlateotocani and Comando de Exterminio.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mexico|Language}}\n{{InterWiki|code=nah}}\n* [[Aztec codices]]\n* [[List of extinct languages of North America]]\n* [[Mesoamerican language area]]\n{{-}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|indent=yes}}<!--BEGIN biblio format.

During the subsequent centuries, it was largely displaced by [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and evolved into some of the modern [[Nahuan languages]] in use today (other modern dialects descend more directly from other 16th-century variants). Although classified as an [[extinct language]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=nci |title=Ethnologue summary for Classical Nahuatl |access-date=2006-06-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218111931/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=nci |archive-date=2013-02-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Classical Nahuatl has survived through a multitude of written sources transcribed by [[Nahua peoples]] and Spaniards in the [[Latin script]].\n\n==Classification==\nClassical Nahuatl is one of the [[Nahuan languages]] within the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan family]]. It is classified as a central dialect and is most closely related to the modern dialects of Nahuatl spoken in the valley of Mexico in colonial and modern times. It is probable that the Classical Nahuatl documented by 16th- and 17th-century written sources represents a particularly prestigious [[sociolect]]. That is to say, the variety of Nahuatl recorded in these documents is most likely to be more particularly representative of the speech of Aztec nobles (''[[pipiltin|p\u012bpiltin]]''), while the commoners (''[[Macehualtin|m\u0101c\u0113hualtin]]'') spoke a somewhat different variety.\n\n==Phonology==\n\n===Vowels===\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! align=\"center\"|[[Front vowel|Front]]\n! align=\"center\"|[[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|[[Close vowel|Close]]\n| align=\"center\"|{{IPA|i, i\u02d0}}\n|rowspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"|{{IPA|o, o\u02d0}}\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|[[Mid vowel|Mid]]\n| align=\"center\"|{{IPA|e, e\u02d0}}\n|-\n! align=\"left\"|[[Open vowel|Open]]\n|colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"|{{IPA|a, a\u02d0}}\n|}\n\n===Consonants===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"|\n! rowspan=\"2\"|[[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n! colspan=\"2\"|[[Dental consonant|Dental]]\n! rowspan=\"2\"|[[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! colspan=\"2\"|[[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n! rowspan=\"2\"|[[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-align=center\n!<small>[[central consonant|central]]</small>\n!<small>[[lateral consonant|lateral]]</small>\n!<small>plain</small>\n!<small>[[labialization|labial]]</small>\n|-align=center\n!

[[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n| \n|\n| {{IPA|l}}\n| {{IPA|j}}\n|\n| {{IPA|w}}\n|\n|}\n\n===Accent===\n[[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] generally falls on the penultimate syllable. The one exception is the [[vocative case]].{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} When used by men it has the suffix '''-e''', where stress falls on the final syllable, e.g. '''Cu\u0101uhtli<u>quetz</u>qui''' (a name, meaning \"[[eagle warrior|Eagle Warrior]]\"), but '''Cu\u0101uhtliquetz<u>qu\u00e9</u>''' \"O Cuauhtliquetzqui!\"\nWhen women use the vocative, the stress is shifted to the final syllable without adding any suffix.\n\"Oquichtli\" means \"man\", and \"Oquichtl\u00ed\" means \"O man!\"\n\n===Phonotactics===\nMaximally complex Nahuatl syllables are of the form CVC; that is, there can be at most one consonant at the beginning and end of every syllable. In contrast, [[English language|English]], for example, allows up to three consonants syllable-initially and up to four  [[consonant]]s to occur at the end of syllables (e.g. ''<u>str</u>e<u>ngths</u>)'' (''ngths'' = {{IPA|/\u014bk\u03b8s/}}). Consonant clusters are only allowed word-medially, Nahuatl uses processes of both epenthesis (usually of /i/) and deletion to deal with this constraint.\n\nFor such purposes, ''tl'' {{IPA|/t\u026c/}}, like all other affricates, is treated as a single sound, and not all consonants can occur in both syllable-initial and syllable-final position.\n\n==Grammar==\n{{main|Classical Nahuatl grammar}}\n\n==Writing system==\n{{main|Nahuatl orthography}}\nAt the time of the Spanish conquest, Aztec writing used mostly [[pictogram]]s supplemented with a few [[ideogram]]s. When needed, it also used syllabic equivalences{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}; [[Diego Dur\u00e1n]] recorded how the ''tlacuilos'' could render a prayer in [[Latin]] using this system but it was difficult to use. The writing system was adequate for keeping such records as genealogies, astronomical information, and tribute lists, but it could not represent a full vocabulary of spoken language in the way that the [[writing system]]s of the [[Old World]] or the [[Maya civilization]]'s [[Maya script|script]] could.\n\nThe Spanish introduced the [[Latin script]], which was then used to record a large body of Aztec prose and poetry, which somewhat diminished the devastating loss caused by the burning of thousands of [[Aztec codices]] by the Spanish authorities.\n\nOn the [[:nah:|Nahuatl edition of Wikipedia]], the language is written in a Latin script, including four [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] with [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]]s or long vowels: [[\u0101]], [[\u0113]], [[\u012b]], [[\u014d]]. Many other foreign letters such as ''b'' or ''k'' are used only in foreign names, such as in Francitl\u0101n ([[France]]).\n\nThe orthography used there is outlined below:\n<big><center>'''a c ch cu e hu i l* m n o p qu t tl tz x y z \u0101 \u0113 \u012b \u014d ll* h*'''</center></big>\nNotes:\n*Letters above marked with an asterisk (*) have no capital forms except in foreign names.\n*Like in Spanish, {{IPA|/k/}} is written as {{angbr|c}}, except before {{angbr|i}} or {{angbr|e}} in which case {{angbr|qu}} is used. Likewise, {{IPA|/s/}} is written as {{angbr|z}}, except before {{angbr|i}} or {{angbr|e}}, in which case {{angbr|c}} is used. However, {{IPA|/ts/}} is always written as {{angbr|tz}}.\n** The Classical Nahuatl {{IPA|/s/}} was likely substantially different from the normal Spanish ''s'' [[Early Modern Spanish|of the time]], a [[Voiceless alveolar fricative#Voiceless alveolar sibilant|voiceless retracted apico-alveolar sibilant fricative]] {{IPA|/s\u033a/}} (still the norm in modern northern [[Peninsular Spanish]]; the sound may be perceived by an English speaker as some sort of cross between {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/\u0283/}}). It was far more similar to the normal Spanish ''z'' of that time period: {{IPA|/s\u033b/}}, a voiceless laminal alveolar sibilant fricative, like the typical English {{IPA|/s/}}. This would explain why {{angbr|z}} and {{angbr|c}} were used instead of {{angbr|s}} to write the sound.\n*{{angbr|x}} is used for the sh-sound {{IPA|/\u0283/}}, as in Early Modern Spanish.\n*{{angbr|cu}} and {{angbr|hu}}, which represent {{IPA|/k\u02b7/}} and {{IPA|/w/}} respectively, are inverted to {{angbr|uc}} and {{angbr|uh}} at the end of a syllable.\n** The letter {{angbr|u}} is used only in digraphs, as the Nahuatl language lacks an {{IPA|/u/}}, distinct from {{IPA|/o/}}.\n*{{angbr|h}} represents a glottal stop, a sort of pause caused by constricting the throat, as in ''uh-oh''.\n\n==Literature==\n[[Mesoamerican literature|Nahuatl literature]] is extensive (probably the most extensive of all Indigenous languages of the Americas), including a relatively large corpus of [[poetry]] (see also [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]]). The ''[[Huei tlamahui\u00e7oltica]]'' is an excellent early sample of literary Nahuatl.\n\nA [[bilingual]] dictionary with Spanish was first published in 1611, ''[[Vocabulario manual de las lenguas castellana y mexicana]]'' and is \"the most important and most frequently reprinted Spanish work on Nahuatl,\" according to the [[World Digital Library]].<ref>{{Cite web| title = Manual Vocabulary of the Spanish and Mexican Languages: In Which are Contained the Words, Questions, and Answers Commonly and Usually Found in the Treatment and Communication Between Spaniards and Indians | work = [[World Digital Library]] | accessdate = 2013-05-23 | url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2836/}}</ref>\n\nNow, Classical Nahuatl is used by [[black metal]] groups of [[Mexico]] supporting ''[[indigenismo]]'', such as Kukulcan, Tlateotocani and Comando de Exterminio.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mexico|Language}}\n{{InterWiki|code=nah}}\n* [[Aztec codices]]\n* [[List of extinct languages of North America]]\n* [[Mesoamerican language area]]\n{{-}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|indent=yes}}<!--BEGIN biblio format.
