Hundreds of people arrived on tightly packed, unseaworthy vessels, and many paid large amounts of money to [[people smuggling|people smugglers]] for their passage to Australia.\n\nAt dawn on 24 August 2001, a 20-metre wooden [[fishing boat]], the ''Palapa 1'', with 438 (369 men, 26 women and 43 children) mainly [[Hazara people|Hazara]], became stranded in international waters about 140&nbsp;km north of Christmas Island.\n\nOn 26 August, Rescue Coordination Centre (RCC) Australia, which had been aware of the vessel's distress, possibly through [[Australian Coastwatch|Coastwatch]] surveillance, requested all ships in the area to respond. Of the ships that acknowledged the request, the ''Tampa'' was closest to the site and began to proceed towards the distressed ''Palapa 1''.\n\nAccording to international law, survivors of a shipwreck are to be taken to the closest suitable port for medical treatment. The closest suitable port was 12 hours away in [[Merak, Banten|Merak]], Indonesia.

RCC sent a fax to the Indonesian Search and Rescue Agency (BASARNAS) on the night of 25 August but received no response. On Sunday, 26 August, Australian EST, the Australian embassy sent the naval attach\u00e9 David Ramsay to visit BASARNAS. By this time, Australian surveillance had observed that the ship's passengers had fashioned signs that read \"SOS\" and 'HELP\" on the ship's deck and, in response, further attempts were made to contact BASARNAS, first by fax and then through the defence attach\u00e9 in Jakarta. At this time, [[Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Australia)|DIMA]] called RCC 'asking if vessels that respond to Australian search and rescue broadcast can tow the stranded vessel to Indonesia'.\n\nA call to shipping was broadcast at 12:48 Canberra time:\n\n<blockquote>Subject: Distress Relay. A 35-metre Indonesian type vessel with 80 plus persons on board adrift in the vicinity of 09.32.5 south 104.44 east\u2026 vessel has SOS and HELP written on the roof.

A Rinnan, Master.\"  After an hour of setting course for the vessel, Rinnan received a direction from RCC apparently attempting to disown the rescue operation: \"Please note that Indonesian search and rescue authorities have accepted co-ordination of this incident.\"\n\nThe ''Tampa'' reached the vessel, guided by [[Australian Coastwatch]] [[De Havilland Canada Dash 8|de Havilland Dash-8]] aircraft, at about 2 pm. The first child was lifted to safety at 2:30pm and the rescue operation continued all afternoon.\n\nRinnan recounted in an interview with ''Norway Today'':\n{{quote |They sent a plane to direct us to the sinking boat.

The Australian government refused permission for the ship to enter Australia's territorial waters, and threatened to prosecute Captain Arne Rinnan as a [[people smuggler]] if it did so.<ref>[[David Marr (journalist)|David Marr]] & [[Marian Wilkinson]] (2005).

Indonesia had also accepted co-ordination of the rescue, and the closest suitable port was Merak in Indonesia. The [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Australia)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]], [[Alexander Downer]] explained to parliament that \"It is important that people understand that Australia has no obligation under International law to accept the rescued persons in to Australian territory.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/qwon/1999_2001/010828_qwn.html |title=Question Without Notice |publisher=Australian Government |work=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade |date=28 August 2001 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909065309/http://www.dfat.gov.au/qwon/1999_2001/010828_qwn.html |archivedate=9 September 2007 }}</ref> Australian ambassador [[David Stuart (diplomat)|David Stuart]] said in the United Nations that \"the rescue by the MV Tampa occurred outside the search and rescue region designated as being the responsibility of Australia.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.australiaun.org/unny/il_271101.html |title=Oceans and the Law of the Sea |date=27 November 2001 |publisher=Australian Permanent Mission to the United Nations |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007095150/http://www.australiaun.org/unny/il_271101.html |archivedate=7 October 2007 }}</ref> Although the ''Tampa'' had responded to a broadcast by an Australian rescue agency, on 30 August, Downer stated in parliament that the survivors were picked up \"at the direction of the Indonesian search and rescue authorities.\"<ref>{{Cite web |title=Question Without Notice |url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/qwon/1999_2001/010830qwn.html |publisher=Australian Government |work=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade |date=30 August 2001 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909064612/http://www.dfat.gov.au/qwon/1999_2001/010830qwn.html |archivedate=9 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\nFaced with Australia's threats of prosecution, Captain Rinnan agreed to turn slowly back towards Indonesia in the hope that the asylum seekers would not notice. About half an hour into the turn, however, they did notice and again became agitated. Captain Rinnan, concerned that if the ship continued to sail to Indonesia the asylum seekers could jump overboard or riot and harm the crew, decided to head back towards Christmas Island.<ref>[[David Marr (journalist)|David Marr]] & [[Marian Wilkinson]] (2005). ''[[Dark Victory]]'', p. 33. {{ISBN|1-74114-447-7}}.</ref>\n\nAs the ship approached the boundary of Australia's territorial waters ({{convert|12|nmi|km}} from the island), Captain Rinnan pleaded for permission for the ship to dock at Christmas Island. He reported that several of the asylum seekers were unconscious, and others were suffering from [[dysentery]], statements subsequently supported by the SASR physician, but later disputed by Australian authorities. The Australian government provided medical assistance and food, but still refused permission for the ship to enter Australian territorial waters. The Australian government sent military personnel to Christmas Island, ostensibly to be ready to provide this assistance to the ship.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nOn 29 August, Captain Rinnan, having lost patience with the Australian authorities, and increasingly concerned for the safety of the asylum seekers and the ship's crew, declared a state of emergency and proceeded to enter Australian territorial waters without permission. The legality of this action has been the subject of debate, with the Australian government maintaining that it was illegal.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n==Deployment of SASR==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}\nThe Australian government responded by dispatching Australian troops ([[Australian Special Air Service Regiment|SASR]]) led by squadron commander Major Vance Khan, under Colonel [[Gus Gilmore]], to board the ship and prevent it from approaching any closer to Christmas Island.\n\nThe SASR doctor later reported that the rescuees were generally dehydrated, malnourished and unhappy. Many were suffering from dehydration, exhaustion and minor ailments including sixty one cases of [[scabies]], forty six of [[head lice]], and twenty four of [[gastroenteritis]]. They also attended to four pregnant women.\n\nThere were some disputes between the SASR and the ship's medical officer Christian Maltau, a deck officer with limited medical experience, regarding the deployment of medical supplies from the ''Tampa'', and the use of the limited supplies of water.  In one incident, the ship's officer turned off the ship's water supply while rescuees were being washed after an outbreak of [[diarrhoea]].\n\nCaptain Rinnan anchored approximately four nautical miles off Christmas Island. Shortly afterwards the [[Australian Prime Ministers|Prime Minister of Australia]], [[John Howard]], reported the boarding of the ship to the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]].\n\n==Escalation==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}\nThe Australian troops instructed Captain Rinnan to move the ship back into international waters; he refused, claiming the ship was unsafe to sail until the asylum seekers had been offloaded. The ship-owners said they agreed with his decision, and the Norwegian government warned the Australian government not to seek to force the ship to return to international waters against the captain's will.\n\nThe Australian government tried to persuade Indonesia to accept the asylum seekers; Indonesia refused. Norway also refused to accept the asylum seekers and reported Australia to the United Nations, the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]], and the [[International Maritime Organization]] for alleged failure to obey its duties under [[international law]], though it did not ask for the assistance of these organisations.\n\nCaptain Rinnan received the highest civil honour in Norway as a result of his handling of this difficult incident. Rinnan has been a sailor since 1958, and a captain for 23 years. He said of the incident:\n\n<blockquote>I have seen most of what there is to see in this profession, but what I experienced on this trip is the worst. When we asked for food and medicine for the refugees, the Australians sent commando troops on board. This created a very high tension among the refugees. After an hour of checking the refugees, the troops agreed to give medical assistance to some of them\u2026 The soldiers obviously didn't like their mission.<ref>{{Cite news|last=INSIDER|first=MIKE WILLIAMS-THE OUTSIDE|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/|title=Mike Williams: Compassion important, not politics|date=2015-09-06|work=NZ Herald|access-date=2020-04-06|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Border Protection Bill 2001 ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}\nLate on the night of 29 August, the Prime Minister introduced an emergency bill entitled the \"Border Protection Bill 2001\". This Bill would have provided the government with the power to remove any ship in the territorial waters of Australia (s 4), to use reasonable force to do so (s 5), to provide that any person who was on the ship may be forcibly returned to the ship (s 6), that no civil or criminal proceedings may be taken against the Australian government or any of its officers for removing the ship or returning people to it (s 7), that no court proceedings are available to prevent the ship from being removed and from people being returned to it (s 8), and that no asylum applications may be made by people on board the ship (s 9). The bill was intended to enter into force at 9:00 Australian Eastern Standard Time, 29 August 2001 (s 2); thus making the bill [[Ex post facto law|retroactive]]. It also attempted to ensure actions taken prior to legislation passage to remove ship and return people to it would have been treated as legal.\n\nThe Opposition [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] announced they would not support the bill; nor would the [[Australian Greens|Greens]], [[Australian Democrats|Democrats]] or independent Senator [[Brian Harradine]]. The bill quickly passed the lower [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], but was rejected by the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] later that same sitting day.<ref>''Senate Debates'', 29 August 2001, p. 3566.</ref> The Government attacked the Opposition for refusing to pass the legislation, but indicated it would not reintroduce it at that stage.\n\nThe government subsequently acted to excise Christmas Island and a large number of other coastal islands from Australia's migration zone, effectively meaning that any asylum seekers who did not reach the Australian mainland would not be able to apply for refugee status. The Labor party supported the excision of some islands that it viewed as acting as a \"magnet for people smugglers\", but not others, such as [[Melville Island, Northern Territory|Melville Island]], Northern Territory which it viewed as being too close to the mainland to justify excision. The other parties opposed excision of any islands.\n\n==Political effects==\nInternationally, Australia was criticised by several countries, particularly Norway, which accused it of evading its human rights responsibilities.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1522723.stm Australia ships out Afghan refugees], [[BBC News]], 3 September 2001.</ref>\n\nDomestically, the government's line attracted strong support, especially in the aftermath of the [[11 September attacks]].

RCC sent a fax to the Indonesian Search and Rescue Agency (BASARNAS) on the night of 25 August but received no response. On Sunday, 26 August, Australian EST, the Australian embassy sent the naval attach\u00e9 David Ramsay to visit BASARNAS. By this time, Australian surveillance had observed that the ship's passengers had fashioned signs that read \"SOS\" and 'HELP\" on the ship's deck and, in response, further attempts were made to contact BASARNAS, first by fax and then through the defence attach\u00e9 in Jakarta. At this time, [[Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Australia)|DIMA]] called RCC 'asking if vessels that respond to Australian search and rescue broadcast can tow the stranded vessel to Indonesia'.\n\nA call to shipping was broadcast at 12:48 Canberra time:\n\n<blockquote>Subject: Distress Relay. A 35-metre Indonesian type vessel with 80 plus persons on board adrift in the vicinity of 09.32.5 south 104.44 east\u2026 vessel has SOS and HELP written on the roof.

A Rinnan, Master.\"  After an hour of setting course for the vessel, Rinnan received a direction from RCC apparently attempting to disown the rescue operation: \"Please note that Indonesian search and rescue authorities have accepted co-ordination of this incident.\"\n\nThe ''Tampa'' reached the vessel, guided by [[Australian Coastwatch]] [[De Havilland Canada Dash 8|de Havilland Dash-8]] aircraft, at about 2 pm. The first child was lifted to safety at 2:30pm and the rescue operation continued all afternoon.\n\nRinnan recounted in an interview with ''Norway Today'':\n{{quote |They sent a plane to direct us to the sinking boat.

The [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Australia)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]], [[Alexander Downer]] explained to parliament that \"It is important that people understand that Australia has no obligation under International law to accept the rescued persons in to Australian territory.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/qwon/1999_2001/010828_qwn.html |title=Question Without Notice |publisher=Australian Government |work=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade |date=28 August 2001 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909065309/http://www.dfat.gov.au/qwon/1999_2001/010828_qwn.html |archivedate=9 September 2007 }}</ref> Australian ambassador [[David Stuart (diplomat)|David Stuart]] said in the United Nations that \"the rescue by the MV Tampa occurred outside the search and rescue region designated as being the responsibility of Australia.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.australiaun.org/unny/il_271101.html |title=Oceans and the Law of the Sea |date=27 November 2001 |publisher=Australian Permanent Mission to the United Nations |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007095150/http://www.australiaun.org/unny/il_271101.html |archivedate=7 October 2007 }}</ref> Although the ''Tampa'' had responded to a broadcast by an Australian rescue agency, on 30 August, Downer stated in parliament that the survivors were picked up \"at the direction of the Indonesian search and rescue authorities.\"<ref>{{Cite web |title=Question Without Notice |url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/qwon/1999_2001/010830qwn.html |publisher=Australian Government |work=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade |date=30 August 2001 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909064612/http://www.dfat.gov.au/qwon/1999_2001/010830qwn.html |archivedate=9 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\nFaced with Australia's threats of prosecution, Captain Rinnan agreed to turn slowly back towards Indonesia in the hope that the asylum seekers would not notice. About half an hour into the turn, however, they did notice and again became agitated. Captain Rinnan, concerned that if the ship continued to sail to Indonesia the asylum seekers could jump overboard or riot and harm the crew, decided to head back towards Christmas Island.<ref>[[David Marr (journalist)|David Marr]] & [[Marian Wilkinson]] (2005). ''[[Dark Victory]]'', p. 33. {{ISBN|1-74114-447-7}}.</ref>\n\nAs the ship approached the boundary of Australia's territorial waters ({{convert|12|nmi|km}} from the island), Captain Rinnan pleaded for permission for the ship to dock at Christmas Island. He reported that several of the asylum seekers were unconscious, and others were suffering from [[dysentery]], statements subsequently supported by the SASR physician, but later disputed by Australian authorities. The Australian government provided medical assistance and food, but still refused permission for the ship to enter Australian territorial waters. The Australian government sent military personnel to Christmas Island, ostensibly to be ready to provide this assistance to the ship.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nOn 29 August, Captain Rinnan, having lost patience with the Australian authorities, and increasingly concerned for the safety of the asylum seekers and the ship's crew, declared a state of emergency and proceeded to enter Australian territorial waters without permission. The legality of this action has been the subject of debate, with the Australian government maintaining that it was illegal.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n==Deployment of SASR==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}\nThe Australian government responded by dispatching Australian troops ([[Australian Special Air Service Regiment|SASR]]) led by squadron commander Major Vance Khan, under Colonel [[Gus Gilmore]], to board the ship and prevent it from approaching any closer to Christmas Island.\n\nThe SASR doctor later reported that the rescuees were generally dehydrated, malnourished and unhappy. Many were suffering from dehydration, exhaustion and minor ailments including sixty one cases of [[scabies]], forty six of [[head lice]], and twenty four of [[gastroenteritis]]. They also attended to four pregnant women.\n\nThere were some disputes between the SASR and the ship's medical officer Christian Maltau, a deck officer with limited medical experience, regarding the deployment of medical supplies from the ''Tampa'', and the use of the limited supplies of water.  In one incident, the ship's officer turned off the ship's water supply while rescuees were being washed after an outbreak of [[diarrhoea]].\n\nCaptain Rinnan anchored approximately four nautical miles off Christmas Island. Shortly afterwards the [[Australian Prime Ministers|Prime Minister of Australia]], [[John Howard]], reported the boarding of the ship to the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]].\n\n==Escalation==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}\nThe Australian troops instructed Captain Rinnan to move the ship back into international waters; he refused, claiming the ship was unsafe to sail until the asylum seekers had been offloaded. The ship-owners said they agreed with his decision, and the Norwegian government warned the Australian government not to seek to force the ship to return to international waters against the captain's will.\n\nThe Australian government tried to persuade Indonesia to accept the asylum seekers; Indonesia refused. Norway also refused to accept the asylum seekers and reported Australia to the United Nations, the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]], and the [[International Maritime Organization]] for alleged failure to obey its duties under [[international law]], though it did not ask for the assistance of these organisations.\n\nCaptain Rinnan received the highest civil honour in Norway as a result of his handling of this difficult incident. Rinnan has been a sailor since 1958, and a captain for 23 years. He said of the incident:\n\n<blockquote>I have seen most of what there is to see in this profession, but what I experienced on this trip is the worst. When we asked for food and medicine for the refugees, the Australians sent commando troops on board. This created a very high tension among the refugees. After an hour of checking the refugees, the troops agreed to give medical assistance to some of them\u2026 The soldiers obviously didn't like their mission.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}</blockquote>\n\n== Border Protection Bill 2001 ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}\nLate on the night of 29 August, the Prime Minister introduced an emergency bill entitled the \"Border Protection Bill 2001\". This Bill would have provided the government with the power to remove any ship in the territorial waters of Australia (s 4), to use reasonable force to do so (s 5), to provide that any person who was on the ship may be forcibly returned to the ship (s 6), that no civil or criminal proceedings may be taken against the Australian government or any of its officers for removing the ship or returning people to it (s 7), that no court proceedings are available to prevent the ship from being removed and from people being returned to it (s 8), and that no asylum applications may be made by people on board the ship (s 9). The bill was intended to enter into force at 9:00 Australian Eastern Standard Time, 29 August 2001 (s 2); thus making the bill [[Ex post facto law|retroactive]]. It also attempted to ensure actions taken prior to legislation passage to remove ship and return people to it would have been treated as legal.\n\nThe Opposition [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] announced they would not support the bill; nor would the [[Australian Greens|Greens]], [[Australian Democrats|Democrats]] or independent Senator [[Brian Harradine]]. The bill quickly passed the lower [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], but was rejected by the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] later that same sitting day.<ref>''Senate Debates'', 29 August 2001, p. 3566.</ref> The Government attacked the Opposition for refusing to pass the legislation, but indicated it would not reintroduce it at that stage.\n\nThe government subsequently acted to excise Christmas Island and a large number of other coastal islands from Australia's migration zone, effectively meaning that any asylum seekers who did not reach the Australian mainland would not be able to apply for refugee status. The Labor party supported the excision of some islands that it viewed as acting as a \"magnet for people smugglers\", but not others, such as [[Melville Island, Northern Territory|Melville Island]], Northern Territory which it viewed as being too close to the mainland to justify excision. The other parties opposed excision of any islands.\n\n==Political effects==\nInternationally, Australia was criticised by several countries, particularly Norway, which accused it of evading its human rights responsibilities.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1522723.stm Australia ships out Afghan refugees], [[BBC News]], 3 September 2001.</ref>\n\nDomestically, the government's line attracted strong support, especially in the aftermath of the [[11 September attacks]].

Davis appears as a supposedly devoted [[nanny]] caring for a 10-year-old boy recently discharged from a home for disturbed children. It is based on the novel of the same title by Evelyn Piper (a pseudonym for [[Merriam Modell]]), and the film was scored by [[Richard Rodney Bennett]]. The film was made by [[Hammer Film Productions]] at [[Elstree Studios]].\n\n== Synopsis ==\n{{Long plot|section|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe Fanes, Bill and Virginia, are about to welcome their ten-year-old son Joey back from the special school he has attended for two years, although it is not clear why he has been away. It is suggested that it was as a result of his younger sister, Susie, dying.\u00a0 His mother, who appears to be neurotic and disturbed (she refuses to go with her husband to meet Joey), wistfully looks at photos of herself with Susie.\n\nJoey appears to be a very disturbed and truculent child, who pretends to have hanged himself at the special school before his father arrives to collect him, deceiving one of the staff. He clearly hates and mistrusts the family's nanny (called simply Nanny by everyone throughout the film). \u00a0Once back home he proves himself to be sullen and almost uncontrollable, refusing any help from Nanny, whilst demanding everything be the way he wants it, including refusing to eat any food that Nanny has made or bought for him, including a 'welcome home' cake, and accusing her of trying to poison him. Joey also moves from the bedroom Nanny has prepared for him to a room with a strong lock and access to the fire escape. Although Joey wants Nanny to be dismissed, his father explains that she was Nanny to his mother and aunt (Pen) and has been with the family for many years and is considered to be part of the family. Aunt Pen appears to get on well with Joey, although it is revealed that she has a very weak heart (from a childhood bout with rheumatic fever) and a shock or any undue excitement could kill her, a fact which seems to hold an unusual interest for Joey. Bill Fane is a [[Queen's Messenger]] who is away from home a great deal, and he has to travel to Beirut and will be gone a few days; after he leaves for the airport he does not reappear in the film.\n\nOne day Joey sees a 14-year-old girl, Bobbie Medman, who is the daughter of a doctor who lives in a flat upstairs, going down the fire escape and strikes up a friendship with her. He demonstrates his unruly behaviour by dropping a flower box which nearly hits a milkman; he also places a doll upside down in a filled bath and then gets Nanny to go to the bath (supposedly to turn the water off), and when she does so and sees the doll she is greatly disturbed by the sight. It is clear that this is some reference to an incident in the past, as his mother is very angry with him for playing such a trick. Joey then tells Bobbie what he claimed happened to his sister. In his version, Nanny went out leaving him and Susie alone. During this period Susie, whilst trying to bathe her doll, lost her balance and fell into the bath, knocking herself unconscious. When Nanny returns, she runs the bath (without noticing the child and doll in the bath) and accidentally drowns Susie.\n\nJoey continues to defy Nanny, and is particularly insistent that she does not come in whilst he is in the bathroom having a bath, which she agrees to at his insistence. When she cooks one of his favourite dishes, he refuses to eat it, but instead she spoon-feeds Virginia (who seems incapable of doing anything for herself, and is totally reliant on Nanny). Nanny also complains that Joey has been rooting around in her medicine box. When Virginia then falls ill with food poisoning, Bobbie's father arranges for her to go to hospital, and Nanny finds the cause of the poisoning - some medicine from her cabinet - under Joey's pillow, but he claims, rather half-heartedly and without conviction, that he didn't do it but that it was Nanny. He refuses to stay in the house alone with Nanny, so his Aunt Pen comes over to stay with him and Nanny.\n\nJoey barricades himself in his room; at 01:30 Pen is woken up and when she goes to the kitchen, she finds Nanny, standing outside Joey's room with a pillow in her hands. Pen remembers that Nanny always disliked pillows, and it suddenly dawns on her that Joey is right after all, Nanny is trying to kill him. This realisation however sets off a panic attack, and she suffers a heart attack, but this time Nanny, instead of helping her as she did once before, watches her die as she relates what really happened on the day Susie died. She tells Pen that she received a call one day, and took a taxi to a run-down part of town, where she found Dr Wills and a woman called Janet, who is lying dead in bed. It transpires that Janet is Nanny's illegitimate daughter, who died during an illegal abortion. Nanny returns to the house in a daze, from which point her version of events matches that of Joey's earlier in the film, although in her mind she also sees Susie alive and well and having a bath, as well as drowned in the bath with her doll.\n\nSatisfied that Pen is now dead, Nanny tries to enter Joey's bedroom, presumably to smother him with the pillow, but he is woken up as she is unable to enter quietly as he has barricaded the door. As he tries to escape through the window onto the fire escape, Nanny manages to grab him by the ankle, causing him to fall and hit his head on a trunk, knocking him unconscious. Nanny then attempts to drown him in the bath, but changes her mind at the last minute and pulls him out of the water, whereupon he runs off. The film ends with Doctor Medman explaining everything to Virginia, before Joey comes in and hugs his mother, saying that he will help her now with everything.\n\n== Cast ==\n{| class= \"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The Science Centre functions as a place for visitors to experiment hands-on with installations.\n\nThe glass facade of the front entrance has a large, exposed steel cable structure. This gesture immediately involves visitors to experience the engineering and science behind architecture, an example of experiential learning in itself. The interior lends itself to flexibility, with large open spaces fit for various installations, exhibits, and large crowds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2019/09/26/ontario-science-centre-turns-50-still-as-hands-on-as-ever-but-a-digital-world-is-posing-challenges.html|title=Ontario Science Centre turns 50, still as hands-on as ever.

He attended the School of Industrial Art in Manhattan (now the [[High School of Art and Design]]), which held many of its classes at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].\nIn 1962 Williams entered [[Pratt Institute]] to study painting.  During his junior year, he won a summer scholarship to [[The Skowhegan School of Art]] and received a [[National Endowment for the Arts]] traveling grant.\n\n==College years==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:william t williams high school.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Brooklyn Museum, 1963|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Wednesday, 22 July 2009|date=May 2012}}|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Thursday, 30 July 2009|date=May 2012}}]] -->\n\nHe received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from [[Pratt Institute]] in 1966 and studied at [[The Skowhegan School of Art]].  In 1968 he received a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degree from [[Yale University]] School of Art and Architecture.\n\nWilliams quickly gained attention from the mainstream art world.  The [[Museum of Modern Art]] acquired his composition \"Elbert Jackson L.A.M.F., Part II\" in 1969, and by 1970 his work was being exhibited at the [[Fondation Maeght]] in the south of France.\n\n===Art school===\n\nAfter his formal education at [[Pratt Institute]] and [[Yale University]] in the 1960s in the visual arts curriculum, he investigated the physical boundaries one finds uncommon to explorations in the science of color, setting for himself the standard of achieving in his work an inherent completeness out of the reach of other painters.\n\n===The late 1960s===\n\n[[File:william t williams trane.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Trane, 1969, col. Studio Museum in Harlem]]\n\nIn 1969 he participated in ''The Black Artist in America: A Symposium'', held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.  He also took part in numerous exhibitions including the [[Studio Museum in Harlem]]'s Inaugural Show, ''X to the Fourth Power'', and ''New Acquisitions'' held at the Museum of Modern Art.  In 1970 Williams was commissioned by the [[Jewish Museum (New York)]], and the [[Menil Collection]] in Houston, Texas.\n\n===Founding the Artist-in-Residence at the Studio Museum===\n\n\"The trustees of the [[Studio Museum in Harlem]] read my proposal, interviewed me and hired me to start an Artist-in-Residence program.  That program had its start at the first site of the Museum over the liquor store on Fifth Avenue (2033 Fifth Avenue).  It was a loft, a factory going out of business that had a lot of sewing machines in it.  [[Mel Edwards]] and I physically cleaned that space out for the Artist-in-Residence program.  That was the beginning.  I wanted to create a context, namely an Artist-in-Residence program, through which money could be funnelled to artists which would allow them to ponder the kinds of issues and questions that come up in a graduate program.\" [[Kinshasa Conwill]], former director of the museum, says that the program \"has become critical to the museum's identity and its contribution to the larger art arena.\"\n\n===Reese Palley installation===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:william t williams reese paley gallery.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Reese Palley opening|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Wednesday, 22 July 2009|date=May 2012}}]] -->\n\nWilliams' first one-man show at New York's [[Reese Palley Gallery]] in 1971 resulted in the sale of every painting. The same year, the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] exhibited his work twice; collectors such as [[AT&T]] and [[General Mills]] purchased his art; and his work was featured in both ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazines.\nValerie J. Mercer\n\n==The 1970s: new inspiration==\n\nWilliams returned home to the dusty unpaved roads of North Carolina for the inspiration of a new palette, one born of the luster and glow of mica, false gold, and fox fire from earth's pulsating cover. Williams' relief from color-field painting was celebrated in the new works completed between 1971\u201377, such as Equinox and Indian Summer. In 1975 William also took part in an artist in residence program at [[Fisk University]] in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\n===FESTAC Festival===\n\nIn 1977, Williams participated in the second [[World Festival of Black Arts]] and African Culture in [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]] (FESTAC). This festival brought together more than 17,000 artists of African descent from 59 countries. It was the largest cultural event ever held on the African continent.\n\n==The 1980s==\n\n===Early exhibitions===\n\nIn 1982 Williams was included in ''Recent Acquisitions'' of the Schomburg Collection at the Schomburg Center in New York.  In 1984 William took part in a show titled ''Since the Harlem Renaissance'', which traveled to the [[University of Maryland]], [[Bucknell University]] and the [[State University of New York at Old Westbury]]. It also traveled to the [[Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute]] in Utica, New York, and the [[Chrysler Museum of Art]] in Norfolk, Virginia.\n\n===1987: Exhibit at the Smithsonian===\n\n[[File:william t williams equinox.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Equinox, 1987]]\n\nIn 1987 William received the John Simon [[Guggenheim Fellowship]].

Over the next 22 years, Williams collaborated with Blackburn to produce 19 editions and a number of unique print projects.  His last project at the Printmaking Workshop was in 1997 when he produced a number of monoprints underwritten by art patron, Major Thomas.\n\n===2000: To conserve a legacy===\n\nIn 2000 Williams took part in an extensive traveling show entitled ''To Conserve a Legacy: American Art from Historically Black Colleges and Universities''. The show organized by the [[Addison Gallery of American Art]] at [[Phillips Academy]] in Andover, Massachusetts and the [[Studio Museum in Harlem]] in New York traveled to eight major museums including the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]], the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], [[Fisk University]], [[Duke University]] and [[Hampton University|Hampton]] Universities Art museums.\n\n===Jazz at Lincoln Center===\n\nIn 1994 Williams participated in a [[Jazz at Lincoln Center]] program titled \"Swing Landscapes: Jazz Visualized\".  The intent of the Jazz Talk program was to explore what it is about jazz that makes its colors, rhythms and characters so attractive to the painter's eye. Williams and author, Alfred Appel, Jr. discussed the influence of [[jazz]] on [[modern art]].  This program was part of a New York Citywide celebration honoring the artist [[Romare Bearden]].\n\n==Current events==\n\n===Receives award for Lifetime Achievement===\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:william t williams brandywine award.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Mel Edwards, W.T.

Between July and late August he made five trips to Philadelphia, staying several days at a time.  These trips yielded four editions and a number of unique hand-colored prints. The Brandywine Workshop located in Philadelphia was founded in 1972 to promote interest and talent in printmaking while cultivating cultural diversity in the arts.\n\n===Printmaking at Lafayette College===\n\nIn 2006, Williams was a visiting scholar and artist in residence at [[Lafayette College]]'s Experimental Printmaking Institute (EPI), which included Williams lecture about his work sponsored by the David L.

He is also a recipient of the [[Studio Museum in Harlem]]'s Artist Award in 1992 and received The James Van Dee Zee Award from the Brandywine Workshop for lifetime achievement in the arts in 2005.\n\nHe received the 2006 North Carolina Award for Fine Arts, the highest civilian honor the state can bestow.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncpedia.org/history-north-carolina-awards|title=History of the North Carolina Awards {{!}} NCpedia|website=www.ncpedia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-02}}</ref> Williams is represented in numerous museum and corporate collections including the [[Museum of Modern Art]], the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], the [[Empire State Plaza#Art collection|Governor Nelson A.

Williams with mother and father 1942|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Tuesday, 22 April 2008|date=May 2012}}]] -->\n\nWilliams is a New York painter with roots in the American South. He spent his early childhood in [[Spring Lake, North Carolina]].<ref>[[David C. Driskell]], \"An Unending Visual Odyssey\".</ref>\n\n===New York: late 1950s===\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:william t williams highschool graduation.jpg|thumb|upright|right|High School Graduation, 1960|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Tuesday, 22 April 2008|date=May 2012}}]] -->\n\nAfter the family's move to the North, his art talent was recognized by the head of a local community center, who gave him a room there to use as a studio. He attended the School of Industrial Art in Manhattan (now the [[High School of Art and Design]]), which held many of its classes at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].\nIn 1962 Williams entered [[Pratt Institute]] to study painting.  During his junior year, he won a summer scholarship to [[The Skowhegan School of Art]] and received a [[National Endowment for the Arts]] traveling grant.\n\n==College years==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:william t williams high school.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Brooklyn Museum, 1963|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Wednesday, 22 July 2009|date=May 2012}}|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Thursday, 30 July 2009|date=May 2012}}]] -->\n\nHe received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from [[Pratt Institute]] in 1966 and studied at [[The Skowhegan School of Art]].  In 1968 he received a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degree from [[Yale University]] School of Art and Architecture.\n\nWilliams quickly gained attention from the mainstream art world.  The [[Museum of Modern Art]] acquired his composition \"Elbert Jackson L.A.M.F., Part II\" in 1969, and by 1970 his work was being exhibited at the [[Fondation Maeght]] in the south of France.\n\n===Art school===\n\nAfter his formal education at [[Pratt Institute]] and [[Yale University]] in the 1960s in the visual arts curriculum, he investigated the physical boundaries one finds uncommon to explorations in the science of color, setting for himself the standard of achieving in his work an inherent completeness out of the reach of other painters.\n\n===The late 1960s===\n\n[[File:william t williams trane.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Trane, 1969, col. Studio Museum in Harlem]]\n\nIn 1969 he participated in ''The Black Artist in America: A Symposium'', held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.  He also took part in numerous exhibitions including the [[Studio Museum in Harlem]]'s Inaugural Show, ''X to the Fourth Power'', and ''New Acquisitions'' held at the Museum of Modern Art.  In 1970 Williams was commissioned by the [[Jewish Museum (New York)]], and the [[Menil Collection]] in Houston, Texas.\n\n===Founding the Artist-in-Residence at the Studio Museum===\n\n\"The trustees of the [[Studio Museum in Harlem]] read my proposal, interviewed me and hired me to start an Artist-in-Residence program.  That program had its start at the first site of the Museum over the liquor store on Fifth Avenue (2033 Fifth Avenue).  It was a loft, a factory going out of business that had a lot of sewing machines in it.  [[Mel Edwards]] and I physically cleaned that space out for the Artist-in-Residence program.  That was the beginning.  I wanted to create a context, namely an Artist-in-Residence program, through which money could be funnelled to artists which would allow them to ponder the kinds of issues and questions that come up in a graduate program.\" [[Kinshasa Conwill]], former director of the museum, says that the program \"has become critical to the museum's identity and its contribution to the larger art arena.\"\n\n===Reese Palley installation===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:william t williams reese paley gallery.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Reese Palley opening|{{Deletable image-caption|1=Wednesday, 22 July 2009|date=May 2012}}]] -->\n\nWilliams' first one-man show at New York's [[Reese Palley Gallery]] in 1971 resulted in the sale of every painting. The same year, the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] exhibited his work twice; collectors such as [[AT&T]] and [[General Mills]] purchased his art; and his work was featured in both ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazines.\nValerie J. Mercer\n\n==The 1970s: new inspiration==\n\nWilliams returned home to the dusty unpaved roads of North Carolina for the inspiration of a new palette, one born of the luster and glow of mica, false gold, and fox fire from earth's pulsating cover. Williams' relief from color-field painting was celebrated in the new works completed between 1971\u201377, such as Equinox and Indian Summer. In 1975 William also took part in an artist in residence program at [[Fisk University]] in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\n===FESTAC Festival===\n\nIn 1977, Williams participated in the second [[World Festival of Black Arts]] and African Culture in [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]] (FESTAC). This festival brought together more than 17,000 artists of African descent from 59 countries. It was the largest cultural event ever held on the African continent.\n\n==The 1980s==\n\n===Early exhibitions===\n\nIn 1982 Williams was included in ''Recent Acquisitions'' of the Schomburg Collection at the Schomburg Center in New York.  In 1984 William took part in a show titled ''Since the Harlem Renaissance'', which traveled to the [[University of Maryland]], [[Bucknell University]] and the [[State University of New York at Old Westbury]]. It also traveled to the [[Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute]] in Utica, New York, and the [[Chrysler Museum of Art]] in Norfolk, Virginia.\n\n===1987: Exhibit at the Smithsonian===\n\n[[File:william t williams equinox.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Equinox, 1987]]\n\nIn 1987 William received the John Simon [[Guggenheim Fellowship]].  He also was a member of a show that took place in Tokyo, Japan entitled ''The Art of Black America in Japan''.  William also took part in ''Contemporary Visual Expressions'', a show at the [[Anacostia Museum]]/[[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington, D.C..\n\n===Espiritu & Materia===\n\nWilliam's traveled to [[Venezuela]] with painter Jack Whitten and sculptors [[Mel Edwards]] and Tyrone Mitchell for the opening of their exhibition Espiritu & Materia at the Museum of Visual Arts, Alejandro Otero.\n\n==The 1990s==\n\n===1992: Studio Museum in Harlem Artist Award===\n\nIn 1992 Williams was presented the [[Studio Museum in Harlem]] Artist's Award for lifetime achievement and his role in creating the artist-in-residence program for the museum.\n\n===Working with Bob Blackburn===\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:william t williams and bob blackburn.jpg|thumb|upright|left|William T.

Over the next 22 years, Williams collaborated with Blackburn to produce 19 editions and a number of unique print projects.  His last project at the Printmaking Workshop was in 1997 when he produced a number of monoprints underwritten by art patron, Major Thomas.\n\n===2000: To conserve a legacy===\n\nIn 2000 Williams took part in an extensive traveling show entitled ''To Conserve a Legacy: American Art from Historically Black Colleges and Universities''. The show organized by the [[Addison Gallery of American Art]] at [[Phillips Academy]] in Andover, Massachusetts and the [[Studio Museum in Harlem]] in New York traveled to eight major museums including the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]], the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], [[Fisk University]], [[Duke University]] and [[Hampton University|Hampton]] Universities Art museums.\n\n===Jazz at Lincoln Center===\n\nIn 1994 Williams participated in a [[Jazz at Lincoln Center]] program titled \"Swing Landscapes: Jazz Visualized\".  The intent of the Jazz Talk program was to explore what it is about jazz that makes its colors, rhythms and characters so attractive to the painter's eye. Williams and author, Alfred Appel, Jr. discussed the influence of [[jazz]] on [[modern art]].  This program was part of a New York Citywide celebration honoring the artist [[Romare Bearden]].\n\n==Current events==\n\n===Receives award for Lifetime Achievement===\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:william t williams brandywine award.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Mel Edwards, W.T.

Between July and late August he made five trips to Philadelphia, staying several days at a time.  These trips yielded four editions and a number of unique hand-colored prints. The Brandywine Workshop located in Philadelphia was founded in 1972 to promote interest and talent in printmaking while cultivating cultural diversity in the arts.\n\n===Printmaking at Lafayette College===\n\nIn 2006, Williams was a visiting scholar and artist in residence at [[Lafayette College]]'s Experimental Printmaking Institute (EPI), which included Williams lecture about his work sponsored by the David L. Sr. and Helen J. Temple Visiting Lecture Series Fund.  During this year, Williams' work was also shown at [[the Studio Museum in Harlem]] in Energy and Experimentation: Black Artists and Abstraction 1964-1980.\n\n===2006: Receives North Carolina Governors Award===\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:william t williams north carolina governors award.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Williams and Governor Michael Easley, 2006|{{puic|1=Image:William t williams north carolina governors award.jpg|log=2008 April 28}}]] -->\n\nIn 2006 William T.
