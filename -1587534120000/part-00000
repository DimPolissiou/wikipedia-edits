It runs parallel to Naushad Ali Road (previously [[Carter Road Promenade|Carter Road]]), a popular sea-front and promenade. Both roads are situated in Mumbai's [[Bandra]] (West) suburb (H-West Ward).\n\nSituated mainly on rolling hills with alternate steep and shallow sides, it garnered the name Pali Hill, although more than one hill is present. The main route of the road was smoothed and paved. The buildings and bungalows are set within the \"valleys\" and \"crests\" of the hills. Nearby localities include [[Pali Village]] and [[Pali Naka]].\n\n==History==\nUntil the 1950s, the area was mainly forested with dense undergrowth. Over the years, it was converted  to grow fruits and crops. At one time, the sea was plainly visible from the foothills.\n\nA few buildings were constructed by entrepreneurs and builders. However, most people lived in cottages or bungalows. Construction of apartment buildings commenced in the mid to late 1960s, including Nibbana Apartments.\n\nCottage dwellers slowly sold their homes to real estate developers and Pali Hill grew into an affluent neighbourhood.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n''[[K. Street Pali Hill]]'' (2004\u20132006), a thriller television soap on [[StarPlus]], produced by [[Ekta Kapoor]] ([[Balaji Telefilms]]) was set in the suburb.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nPali Hill has an expanse of trees that form arches over the roads. Originally an area of orchards, fields and untamed forests, from 1980-2020 it was deforested and made suitable for residential habitation. A few giant trees remain in building compounds, bungalow gardens and on the roads. The most widely seen tree is the [[Delonix regia|gulmohar tree]]. Large (and rare in Mumbai) [[banyan trees]], [[peepul tree]]s, [[mango trees]], [[ashoka tree]]s, wild [[almond trees]], wild [[neem tree]]s as well as a variety of shrubs, grasses, bamboos and trees, like those of the [[papaya]], [[jackfruit]], [[custard-apple]], and [[guava]]<nowiki/>are abundant.\n\nFlowering shrubs are cultivated and sometimes grow wild. Most abundant are [[bougainvillea]], [[jasmine]]s, [[Bird of paradise (flower)|birds of paradise flowers]] and other wild, indigenous varieties.\n\nPali Hill is frequented by migratory birds, present during different seasons. Although the native species are sparrows, [[Asian koel]]s, cuckoos, wrens, pigeons, crows and ravens; rare birds (from other parts of Mumbai/India) are present. Bai Avabai Framji Petit Girls High School sees egrets, storks, owls and other rare birds. Ashy dorus, kites, kestrels, hummingbirds, woodpeckers as well as seagulls and kingfishers (both \u2013 the small blue kingfisher as well as the more colourful variant) are present. Ornithologist [[Salim Ali]] was known to walk around Pali Hill with his binoculars and a notebook taking notes and listening to or making bird calls.\n\nMammals such as dogs (from street strays to pedigrees), cats and small bats are abundant.\n\n==Landmarks==\nPali Hill's landmarks are its buildings and bungalows. At the southern end is Rajendra Kumar Junction (Chowk). Its four roads lead west to Carter Road (via Pali Mala Road), north to Pali Hill, east to [[Pali Naka]] and south to the Auxilium Convent High School. At the northern end is Union Park, another crossing and the area around it. Candies eatery is another local landmark.\n\nThe road diverges downhill on the East side \u2013 the Zig Zag Road (named after its steep incline and acute curves). At this junction was the Anand Bungalow (owned by [[Dev Anand]]). Also at this junction is the bungalow of the Narangs, hoteliers, and owners of the Croissants patisserie and the Ambassador Flight kitchen. On Nargis Dutt road, further down on the west side is the House Of Sushil Kumar Shinde (former Chief Minister of Maharashtra & former Home Minister Of The Govt of India). On the other side residence of the late Rajni Patel ( Rajni Patel was a lawyer, trade union leader and politician \u2013 and much more \u2013 who dominated the political landscape of Bombay in the 1970s. He was a close associate and adviser of Indira Gandhi.

The mission of the School is to advance knowledge of Greece in all periods, as well as other areas of the classical world, by training young scholars, sponsoring and promoting archaeological fieldwork, providing resources for scholarly work, and disseminating research. The ASCSA is also charged by the Hellenic Ministry of Culture and Tourism with primary responsibility for all American archaeological research, and seeks to support the investigation, preservation, and presentation of Greece's cultural heritage.\n\nThe School offers two major research libraries: the [http://www.ascsa.edu.gr/index.php/Blegen-Library/ Blegen Library], with 94,000 volumes dedicated to the ancient Mediterranean world; and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130625112747/http://www.ascsa.edu.gr/index.php/Gennadius/ Gennadius Library], with over 120,000 volumes and archives devoted to post-classical Hellenic civilization and, more broadly, the Balkans and the eastern Mediterranean.

Students receive comprehensive training through visits to the principal archaeological sites and museums of Greece as well as in seminars led by resident and visiting scholars. They also take part in the training program at the Corinth excavations. The School accepts 15 to 20 students in this program.\n\nThe Summer Sessions, which run for two six-week periods each, are open to North American graduate and advanced undergraduate students and to high school and college instructors of classics and related fields. In these sessions, the School condenses its academic year program into an intensive introduction to the sites, museums, and monuments of Greece.

Hicks (1875-1956) was another early president who greatly contributed to the AALL's vision.  Hicks was a law librarian at both Yale and Columbia.  In 1919, Hicks was first elected president of the AALL.  He served two terms as president, 1919-1920 and 1920-1921.  In 1923, Hicks authored ''Materials and Methods of Legal Research''.  Prior to the publication of this book, there were very few legal research texts keeping pace with the explosive growth in casebooks and legal literature.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Etheredge|first=S.|date=2006|title=Frederick C.

Prior to Hicks's input, the ''Journal'' mostly served as a depository for AALL committee reports.

The 1970s were the beginning of the modern era of AALL advocacy.  This decade saw the association helping to provide input and shape several important policy issues such as the 1975 Federal Trade Commission's ''Guides for the Law Book Industry'', the ''[[Copyright Act of 1976]]'', and the 1972 and 1978 amendments to [[Title 44 of the United States Code]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baish|first=M.

The American Association of Law Libraries has been supporting free access to Pacer information for decades. In February 2019 the AALL joined with 15 organization and signed a letter calling for passage of H.R. 6714 the Electronic Records Reform Act. In addition to requiring free access to the federal dockets and documents, the legislation  directs the Administrative Office of the US Courts to consolidate the Case Management/Electronic Case Files system into a single system.<ref>https://www.aallnet.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ECRRA-House-021219.pdf</ref> Additionally this year the AALL joined the American Civil Liberties Union and several other organizations on an amicus brief in response to National Veterans Legal Services Program et al v.

Hicks (1875-1956) was another early president who greatly contributed to the AALL's vision.  Hicks was a law librarian at both Yale and Columbia.  In 1919, Hicks was first elected president of the AALL.  He served two terms as president, 1919-1920 and 1920-1921.  In 1923, Hicks authored ''Materials and Methods of Legal Research''.

It operates the website Al-Islam.org, whose primary objective is to digitize and present quality resources related to history, law, and society of the Islamic religion and its personalities, with particular emphasis on the Twelver Shi'ah Islamic school of thought. Al-Islam.org is a site which also serves as a means of introducing Islam to non-Muslims.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://chnm.gmu.edu/worldhistorysources/r/93/whm.html |title= The Ahlul-Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project |publisher= [[George Mason University]] |author= Sumaiya Hamdani |date= March 2003}}</ref>\n\n==Aims==\nThe Ahlul Bayt DILP's aim is to encourage the research of Islam, and to facilitate propagation of knowledge to locations where such resources are not commonly or easily accessible. To cater to this objective, the Ahlul Bayt DILP is constantly expanding its digital library, which consists of over 4000 resources accessible for free.<ref name=\"guidestar\">{{cite web |url= http://www.guidestar.org/pqShowGsReport.do?partner=justgive&ein=41-1971730 |title= Ahlul bayt digital islamic library project |publisher= JustGive.org}}</ref> The Ahlul Bayt DILP states that it also aims:\n\n{{quote|text=...to encourage research and enquiry which the use of technology facilitates.

The DILP and the Al-Islam.org site are supported by individual donors and well-wishers.\n\n==Ongoing projects==\nOn-route to achieve a vast library with the best resource of Islamic knowledge, the Ahlul Bayt DILP team is currently working on various important projects.\n\n===Digital library===\nThe free digital library consists of more than 800 resources in different languages. To further accommodate its users, the Ahlul Bayt DILP team has been working on various projects which give detailed information on a specific topic. Such projects include the Shiite Encyclopedia, the Event of Gadeer Khum project, and Tahrif (distortion) of Islamic texts.\n\nWhile the majority of the texts currently available in the library are English translations, the DILP volunteers have taken up the task of providing texts in other languages like Spanish, Italian, Swahili, Arabic, Urdu and Gujarati.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/alpha.php |title=Al-islam.org Free Library |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103033122/http://al-islam.org/alpha.php |archivedate=2007-01-03 }}</ref>\n\nThe digital library also includes full texts of Islamic books, written by both scholars and laymen. While it does not hold the actual copyrights on these digitized texts, permission from the copyright holders was taken in order to allow DILP and its volunteers to rectify material in terms of spelling, grammar, etc.\n\n==== Sections of the digital library ====\nThe digital library is divided into different sections, which include:\n* Belief & Creed\n* Education & Society\n* Quran & Hadith\n* History & Politics\n* Spirituality & Philosophy\n* Laws & Worship\n\n===Multimedia gallery===\nThe multimedia section of Al-islam.org has a large collection of audio/video resources.

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> In 1975, the university opened The [[Grey Art Gallery]] at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html|title=Home -

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> In 1975, the university opened The [[Grey Art Gallery]] at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html|title=Home -

It utilizes freshly harvested rice, and is prepared by boiling it in milk and raw cane sugar (jaggery).<ref name=britpongal2/> Sometimes additional ingredients are added to the sweet dish, such as: [[cardamom]], [[raisins]], [[Green gram|Green gram (split)]], and [[cashew nuts]]. Other ingredients include coconut and ghee (clarified butter from cow milk).<ref name=\"Mathews2017p207\"/><ref name=\"Gutierrezp270\"/> Along with the sweet version of the Pongal dish, some prepare other versions such as salty and savoury (''venpongal'').

Relatives and friends are invited, and the standard greeting on the Pongal day typically is, \"has the rice boiled\"?<ref name=britpongal2/>\n\nThe cooking is done in a [[clay pot]] that is often garlanded with leaves or flowers, sometimes tied with a piece of turmeric root or marked with pattern artwork called ''kolam''. It is either cooked at home, or in community gatherings such as in temples or village open spaces.<ref name=\"deGaia2018\"/> It is the ritual dish, along with many other courses prepared from seasonal foods for all present.
