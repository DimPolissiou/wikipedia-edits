As there was another Reijnier Jansz at that time in Delft, it seemed necessary to use the [[pseudonym]] \"Vos\", meaning Fox. From 1640 onward, he had changed his alias to Vermeer.</ref> As an apprentice in Amsterdam, Reijnier lived on fashionable [[Sint Antoniesbreestraat]], a street with many resident painters at the time. In 1615, Reijnier married Digna Baltus.<!--and to facilitate their marriage, he brought a testimonial from Delft.<ref>[http://www.xs4all.nl/~kalden/dart/d-a-vermeer1.htm Vermeer's father Reynier Jansz (c. 1591 \u2013 1652)] His parents were tailor Jan Reyersz and Cornelia, alias Neeltge Goris</ref>--> The couple moved to Delft and had a daughter named Gertruy who was baptized in 1620.<ref group=Note>In 1647 Geertruy, Vermeer's only sister, married a frame maker.

In 1631, he leased an inn, which he called \"The Flying Fox\". In 1635, he lived on Voldersgracht 25 or 26.

The blessing took place in the quiet nearby village of [[Schipluiden]]. Vermeer's new mother-in-law [[Maria Thins]] was significantly wealthier than he, and it was probably she who insisted that Vermeer convert to Catholicism before the marriage on 5 April.<ref group=\"Note\">Catholicism was not a forbidden religion, but tolerated in the [[Dutch Republic]]. They were not allowed to build new churches, so services were held in hidden churches (so-called [[Schuilkerk]]).

The guild's records make clear that Vermeer did not pay the usual admission fee. It was a year of [[Bubonic plague|plague]], [[First Anglo-Dutch War|war]], and economic crisis; Vermeer was not alone in experiencing difficult financial circumstances. In 1654, the city suffered the terrible explosion known as the [[Delft Explosion|Delft Thunderclap]], which destroyed a large section of the city.<ref>[http://www.essentialvermeer.com/maps/delft/delft_in_vermeer's_time.html \"Delft in Johannes Vermeer's Time\"], Essential Vermeer.

Vermeer was responding to the market of [[Gerard Dou]]'s paintings, who sold his paintings for exorbitant prices. Dou may have influenced [[Pieter de Hooch]] and [[Gabriel Metsu]], too.

In 1662, Vermeer was elected head of the guild and was reelected in 1663, 1670, and 1671, evidence that he (like Bramer) was considered an established craftsman among his peers. Vermeer worked slowly, probably producing three paintings a year on order. [[Balthasar de Monconys]] visited him in 1663 to see some of his work, but Vermeer had no paintings to show. The diplomat and the two French clergymen who accompanied him were sent to [[Hendrick van Buyten]], a baker who had a couple of his paintings as collateral.\n\nIn 1671, [[Gerrit van Uylenburgh]] organised the auction of [[Gerrit Reynst]]'s collection and offered 13 paintings and some sculptures to [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]].

Many people panicked; courts, theaters, shops and schools were closed. Five years passed before circumstances improved.

These paintings were sold in Amsterdam the following year in a much-studied auction, published by [[Gerard Hoet]].</ref> Several factors contributed to his limited body of work. Vermeer never had any pupils, though one scholar has suggested that Vermeer taught his eldest daughter Maria to paint.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Binstock, Benjamin.|title=Vermeer's family secrets : genius, discovery, and the unknown apprentice|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|others=Vermeer, Johannes, 1632-1675.|isbn=978-0-415-96664-1|location=New York|oclc=191024081}}</ref> Additionally, his family obligations with so many children may have taken up much of his time, as would acting as both an art-dealer and inn-keeper in running the family businesses. His time spent serving as head of the guild and his extraordinary precision as a painter may have also limited his output.\n\n==Style==\nVermeer may have first executed his paintings tonally like most painters of his time, using either monochrome shades of grey (\"[[grisaille]]\") or a limited palette of browns and greys (\"dead coloring\"), over which he would apply more saturated colors (reds, yellows and blues) in the form of transparent glazes. No drawings have been positively attributed to Vermeer, and his paintings offer few clues to preparatory methods.\n\nThere is no other 17th-century artist who employed the exorbitantly expensive pigment [[lapis lazuli]] (natural [[ultramarine]]) either so lavishly or so early in his career. Vermeer used this in not just elements that are naturally of this colour; the earth colours [[umber]] and [[ochre]] should be understood as warm light within a painting's strongly lit interior, which reflects its multiple colours onto the wall. In this way, he created a world more perfect than any he had witnessed.<ref name=p867 group=Liedtke/> This working method most probably was inspired by Vermeer's understanding of [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo's]] observations that the surface of every object partakes of the colour of the adjacent object.<ref name=wadum95/> This means that no object is ever seen entirely in its natural colour.\n\nA comparable but even more remarkable, yet effectual, use of natural ultramarine is in ''The Girl with the Wine Glass''. The shadows of the red satin dress are [[underpainting|underpainted]] in natural ultramarine,<ref>Gaskell, I., M. Jonker & National Gallery of Art (US) (1998), ''Vermeer Studies''. Washington: National Gallery of Art, p. 157. {{ISBN|0300075219}}</ref> and, owing to this underlying blue paint layer, the red lake and [[vermilion]] mixture applied over it acquires a slightly purple, cool and crisp appearance that is most powerful.\n\nEven after Vermeer's supposed financial breakdown following the so-called [[rampjaar]] (year of disaster) in 1672, he continued to employ natural ultramarine generously, such as in ''Lady Seated at a Virginal''. This could suggest that Vermeer was supplied with materials by a collector, and would coincide with [[John Michael Montias]]\u2019 theory that [[Pieter van Ruijven]] was Vermeer's patron.\n\nVermeer's works are largely [[Genre works|genre pieces]] and portraits, with the exception of two cityscapes and two [[allegory|allegories]]. His subjects offer a cross-section of seventeenth-century Dutch society, ranging from the portrayal of a simple milkmaid at work, to the luxury and splendour of rich notables and merchantmen in their roomy houses. Besides these subjects, religious, poetical, musical, and scientific comments can also be found in his work.\n\n===Painting materials===\nOne aspect of his meticulous painting technique was Vermeer's choice of pigments.<ref>Kuhn, H. \"A Study of the Pigments and Grounds Used by Jan Vermeer\". ''Reports and Studies in the History of Art'', 1968, 154\u2013202</ref> He is best known for his frequent use of the very expensive [[ultramarine]] (''[[The Milkmaid (Vermeer)|The Milkmaid]]''), and also [[lead-tin-yellow]] (''[[A Lady Writing a Letter]]''), [[madder lake]] ([[Christ in the House of Martha and Mary (Vermeer)|''Christ in the House of Martha and Mary'']]), and [[vermilion]]. He also painted with [[ochres]], [[bone black]] and [[azurite]].<ref>Illustrated pigment analyses of Vermeer's paintings: [http://colourlex.com/paintings/paintings-painter/dutch-painters/ Dutch Painters], Colourlex</ref> The claim that he utilized Indian yellow in ''[[Woman Holding a Balance]]''<ref>Kuhn, 1968, pp. 191\u2013192</ref> has been disproven by later pigment analysis.<ref>Gifford, E.M., \"Painting Light: Recent Observations on Vermeer\u2019s Technique\", in Gaskell, I. and Jonker, M., ed., ''Vermeer Studies, in Studies in the History of Art'', 55, National Gallery of Art, Washington 1998, pp. 185\u2013199</ref>\n\nIn Vermeer's oeuvre, only about 20 pigments have been detected. Of these 20 pigments, seven principal pigments which Vermeer commonly employed include lead white, yellow ochre, vermilion, madder lake, green earth, raw umber, and ivory or bone black.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Janson|first1=Jonathan|title=Vermeer's Palette|url=http://www.essentialvermeer.com/palette/palette_vermeer'_palette.html#.WM7coBIrJE5|website=Essential Vermeer|accessdate=19 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Camera obscura===\n\nVermeer's painting techniques have long been a source of debate, given their almost [[photorealistic]] attention to detail, despite Vermeer's having had no formal training, and despite only limited evidence that Vermeer had created any preparatory sketches or traces for his paintings.{{CN|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn 2001, British artist [[David Hockney]] published the book ''Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters'', in which he argued that Vermeer (among other Renaissance and Baroque artists including [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]] and [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]) used optics to achieve precise positioning in their compositions, and specifically some combination of [[curved mirror]]s, [[camera obscura]], and [[camera lucida]]. This became known as the [[Hockney\u2013Falco thesis]], named after Hockney and [[Charles M. Falco]], another proponent of the theory.\n\nProfessor Philip Steadman published the book ''Vermeer's Camera: Uncovering the Truth behind the Masterpieces'' in 2001 which specifically claimed that Vermeer had used a camera obscura to create his paintings. Steadman noted that many of Vermeer's paintings had been painted in the same room, and he found six of his paintings that are precisely the right size if they had been painted from inside a camera obscura in the room's back wall.<ref name=BBC_Steadman/>\n\nSupporters of these theories have pointed to evidence in some of Vermeer's paintings, such as the often-discussed sparkling pearly highlights in Vermeer's paintings, which they argue are the result of the primitive lens of a camera obscura producing [[halo (optical phenomenon)|halation]]. It was also postulated that a camera obscura was the mechanical cause of the \"exaggerated\" perspective seen in ''[[The Music Lesson]]'' (London, [[Royal Collection]]).{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn 2008, American entrepreneur and inventor [[Tim Jenison]] developed the theory that Vermeer had used a camera obscura along with a \"comparator mirror\", which is similar in concept to a [[camera lucida]] but much simpler and makes it easy to match color values. He later modified the theory to simply involve a concave mirror and a comparator mirror. He spent the next five years testing his theory by attempting to re-create ''The Music Lesson'' himself using these tools, a process captured in the 2013 documentary film ''[[Tim's Vermeer]]''.<ref name=Vanity/>\n\nSeveral points were brought out by Jenison in support of this technique: first was Vermeer's hyper-accurate rendition of light falloff along the wall. Neurobiologist [[Colin Blakemore]], in an interview with Jenison, notes that human vision cannot process information about the absolute brightness of a scene.<ref name=Tims/> Another was the addition of several highlights and outlines consistent with matching the effects of [[chromatic aberration]], particularly noticeable in primitive optics. Last, and perhaps most telling, is a noticeable curvature in the original painting's rendition of the scrollwork on the harpsichord. This effect matched Jenison's technique precisely, caused by exactly duplicating the view as seen from a curved mirror.\n\nThis theory remains disputed. There is no historical evidence regarding Vermeer's interest in optics, aside from the accurately observed mirror reflection above the lady at the virginals in ''[[The Music Lesson]]''. The detailed inventory of the artist's belongings drawn up after his death does not include a camera obscura or any similar device.<ref name=Obscura/> However, Vermeer was in close connection with pioneer lens maker [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] and Leeuwenhoek was his executor after death.<ref name=bryson/>\n\n==Works==\n{{See also|List of paintings by Johannes Vermeer|Category:Johannes Vermeer }}\nVermeer produced a total of fewer than 50 paintings, of which 34 have survived.<ref name=\"veconomist\">{{cite news|title=Vermeer was brilliant, but he was not without influences|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21730134-blockbuster-show-punctures-myth-solitary-genius-vermeer-was-brilliant-he|work=[[The Economist]]|date=12 October 2017}}</ref> Only three Vermeer paintings were dated by the artist: ''[[The Procuress (Vermeer)|The Procuress]]'' (1656; Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Dresden); ''[[The Astronomer (painting)|The Astronomer]]'' (1668; Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris); and ''[[The Geographer]]'' (1669; St\u00e4delsches Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt).\n\nVermeer's mother-in-law Maria Thins owned [[Dirck van Baburen]]'s 1622 oil-on-canvas ''[[The Procuress (Dirck van Baburen)|The Procuress]]'' (or a copy of it), which appears in the background of two of Vermeer's paintings. The same subject was also painted by Vermeer. Almost all of Vermeer's paintings are of contemporary subjects in a smaller format, with a cooler palette dominated by blues, yellows, and grays. Practically all of his surviving works belong to this period, usually domestic interiors with one or two figures lit by a window on the left. They are characterized by a sense of compositional balance and spatial order, unified by a pearly light. Mundane domestic or recreational activities are imbued with a poetic timelessness (e.g., ''[[Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window]]'', Dresden, Gem\u00e4ldegalerie). Vermeer's two [[townscape]]s have also been attributed to this period: ''[[View of Delft]]'' (The Hague, Mauritshuis) and ''[[The Little Street (Vermeer)|''A street in Delft'']]'' (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum).\n\nA few of his paintings show a certain hardening of manner and are generally thought to represent his late works. From this period come ''[[The Allegory of Faith]]'' (c. 1670; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) and ''[[The Love Letter (Vermeer)|The Love Letter]]'' (c. 1670; Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam).\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Th\u00e9ophile_Thor\u00e9_by_Nadar.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Th\u00e9ophile Thor\u00e9-B\u00fcrger]]]]\nOriginally, Vermeer's works were largely overlooked by art historians for two centuries after his death.

Until the 19th century, the only sources of information were some registers, a few official documents, and comments by other artists; for this reason, Thor\u00e9-B\u00fcrger named him \"The Sphinx of Delft\".<ref name=Delft /> [[John Michael Montias]] added details on the family from the city archives of Delft in his ''Artists and Artisans in Delft: A Socio-Economic Study of the Seventeenth Century'' (1982).\n\n===Youth and heritage===\n\nJohannes Vermeer was [[Baptism|baptized]] within the [[Calvinism|Reformed Church]] on 31 October 1632.<ref name=Name/><ref name=Tree/><ref group=Note>In the 17th century, Johannes was a popular name, and spelling was not consistent. The name could be spelled in the Dutch (Johan or Johannes), French (Joan), Italian (Giovanni), Greek (Johannis), or other style depending on background, education, or family tradition.</ref> His father, named Reijnier Janszoon, was a middle-class worker of [[silk]] or caffa (a mixture of silk and cotton or wool).<ref group=\"Note\">His name was Reijnier or Reynier Janszoon, always written in Dutch as Jansz. or Jansz; this was his [[patronym]]. As there was another Reijnier Jansz at that time in Delft, it seemed necessary to use the [[pseudonym]] \"Vos\", meaning Fox. From 1640 onward, he had changed his alias to Vermeer.</ref> As an apprentice in Amsterdam, Reijnier lived on fashionable [[Sint Antoniesbreestraat]], a street with many resident painters at the time. In 1615, Reijnier married Digna Baltus.<!--and to facilitate their marriage, he brought a testimonial from Delft.<ref>[http://www.xs4all.nl/~kalden/dart/d-a-vermeer1.htm Vermeer's father Reynier Jansz (c. 1591 \u2013 1652)] His parents were tailor Jan Reyersz and Cornelia, alias Neeltge Goris</ref>--> The couple moved to Delft and had a daughter named Gertruy who was baptized in 1620.<ref group=Note>In 1647 Geertruy, Vermeer's only sister, married a frame maker.

In 1631, he leased an inn, which he called \"The Flying Fox\". In 1635, he lived on Voldersgracht 25 or 26. In 1641, he bought a larger inn on the market square, named after the Flemish town \"[[Mechelen]]\". The acquisition of the inn constituted a considerable financial burden.<ref name=p42 group=Huerta/> When Reijnier died in October 1652, Vermeer took over the operation of the family's art business.\n\n===Marriage and family===\n\nIn April 1653, Johannes Reijniersz Vermeer married a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] woman, Catharina Bolenes (Bolnes). The blessing took place in the quiet nearby village of [[Schipluiden]]. Vermeer's new mother-in-law [[Maria Thins]] was significantly wealthier than he, and it was probably she who insisted that Vermeer convert to Catholicism before the marriage on 5 April.<ref group=\"Note\">Catholicism was not a forbidden religion, but tolerated in the [[Dutch Republic]]. They were not allowed to build new churches, so services were held in hidden churches (so-called [[Schuilkerk]]). Catholics were restrained in their careers, unable to get high-rank  jobs in city administration or civic guard. It was impossible to be elected as a member of the city council; therefore, the Catholics were not represented in the provincial and national assembly.</ref> According to art historian [[Walter Liedtke]], Vermeer's conversion seems to have been made with conviction.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Liedtke|first1=Walter|last2=Plomp|first2=Michiel C.|last3=R\u00fcger|first3=Axel|authorlink1=Walter Liedtke|title=Vermeer and the Delft school: [catalogue ... in conjunction with the exhibition \"Vermeer and the Delft School\" held at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, from 8 March to 27 May 2001, and at The National Gallery, London, from 20 June to 16 September 2001]|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_EZxWaNlQKiYC|date=2001|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0870999737|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_EZxWaNlQKiYC/page/n373 359]}}</ref> His painting ''[[The Allegory of Faith]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/32.100.18 |title=Johannes Vermeer: Allegory of the Catholic Faith (32.100.18) &#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=20 July 2012 |accessdate=24 July 2012}}</ref> made between 1670 and 1672, placed less emphasis on the artists' usual naturalistic concerns and more on symbolic religious applications, including the sacrament of the [[Eucharist]].

The guild's records make clear that Vermeer did not pay the usual admission fee. It was a year of [[Bubonic plague|plague]], [[First Anglo-Dutch War|war]], and economic crisis; Vermeer was not alone in experiencing difficult financial circumstances.

It seems that Vermeer turned for inspiration to the art of the [[fijnschilder]]s from Leiden. Vermeer was responding to the market of [[Gerard Dou]]'s paintings, who sold his paintings for exorbitant prices. Dou may have influenced [[Pieter de Hooch]] and [[Gabriel Metsu]], too.

In 1662, Vermeer was elected head of the guild and was reelected in 1663, 1670, and 1671, evidence that he (like Bramer) was considered an established craftsman among his peers. Vermeer worked slowly, probably producing three paintings a year on order. [[Balthasar de Monconys]] visited him in 1663 to see some of his work, but Vermeer had no paintings to show.

Many people panicked; courts, theaters, shops and schools were closed. Five years passed before circumstances improved.

His time spent serving as head of the guild and his extraordinary precision as a painter may have also limited his output.\n\n==Style==\nVermeer may have first executed his paintings tonally like most painters of his time, using either monochrome shades of grey (\"[[grisaille]]\") or a limited palette of browns and greys (\"dead coloring\"), over which he would apply more saturated colors (reds, yellows and blues) in the form of transparent glazes. No drawings have been positively attributed to Vermeer, and his paintings offer few clues to preparatory methods.\n\nThere is no other 17th-century artist who employed the exorbitantly expensive pigment [[lapis lazuli]] (natural [[ultramarine]]) either so lavishly or so early in his career. Vermeer used this in not just elements that are naturally of this colour; the earth colours [[umber]] and [[ochre]] should be understood as warm light within a painting's strongly lit interior, which reflects its multiple colours onto the wall. In this way, he created a world more perfect than any he had witnessed.<ref name=p867 group=Liedtke/> This working method most probably was inspired by Vermeer's understanding of [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo's]] observations that the surface of every object partakes of the colour of the adjacent object.<ref name=wadum95/> This means that no object is ever seen entirely in its natural colour.\n\nA comparable but even more remarkable, yet effectual, use of natural ultramarine is in ''The Girl with the Wine Glass''. The shadows of the red satin dress are [[underpainting|underpainted]] in natural ultramarine,<ref>Gaskell, I., M. Jonker & National Gallery of Art (US) (1998), ''Vermeer Studies''. Washington: National Gallery of Art, p. 157. {{ISBN|0300075219}}</ref> and, owing to this underlying blue paint layer, the red lake and [[vermilion]] mixture applied over it acquires a slightly purple, cool and crisp appearance that is most powerful.\n\nEven after Vermeer's supposed financial breakdown following the so-called [[rampjaar]] (year of disaster) in 1672, he continued to employ natural ultramarine generously, such as in ''Lady Seated at a Virginal''. This could suggest that Vermeer was supplied with materials by a collector, and would coincide with [[John Michael Montias]]\u2019 theory that [[Pieter van Ruijven]] was Vermeer's patron.\n\nVermeer's works are largely [[Genre works|genre pieces]] and portraits, with the exception of two cityscapes and two [[allegory|allegories]]. His subjects offer a cross-section of seventeenth-century Dutch society, ranging from the portrayal of a simple milkmaid at work, to the luxury and splendour of rich notables and merchantmen in their roomy houses. Besides these subjects, religious, poetical, musical, and scientific comments can also be found in his work.\n\n===Painting materials===\nOne aspect of his meticulous painting technique was Vermeer's choice of pigments.<ref>Kuhn, H. \"A Study of the Pigments and Grounds Used by Jan Vermeer\". ''Reports and Studies in the History of Art'', 1968, 154\u2013202</ref> He is best known for his frequent use of the very expensive [[ultramarine]] (''[[The Milkmaid (Vermeer)|The Milkmaid]]''), and also [[lead-tin-yellow]] (''[[A Lady Writing a Letter]]''), [[madder lake]] ([[Christ in the House of Martha and Mary (Vermeer)|''Christ in the House of Martha and Mary'']]), and [[vermilion]]. He also painted with [[ochres]], [[bone black]] and [[azurite]].<ref>Illustrated pigment analyses of Vermeer's paintings: [http://colourlex.com/paintings/paintings-painter/dutch-painters/ Dutch Painters], Colourlex</ref> The claim that he utilized Indian yellow in ''[[Woman Holding a Balance]]''<ref>Kuhn, 1968, pp. 191\u2013192</ref> has been disproven by later pigment analysis.<ref>Gifford, E.M., \"Painting Light: Recent Observations on Vermeer\u2019s Technique\", in Gaskell, I. and Jonker, M., ed., ''Vermeer Studies, in Studies in the History of Art'', 55, National Gallery of Art, Washington 1998, pp. 185\u2013199</ref>\n\nIn Vermeer's oeuvre, only about 20 pigments have been detected. Of these 20 pigments, seven principal pigments which Vermeer commonly employed include lead white, yellow ochre, vermilion, madder lake, green earth, raw umber, and ivory or bone black.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Janson|first1=Jonathan|title=Vermeer's Palette|url=http://www.essentialvermeer.com/palette/palette_vermeer'_palette.html#.WM7coBIrJE5|website=Essential Vermeer|accessdate=19 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Camera obscura===\n\nVermeer's painting techniques have long been a source of debate, given their almost [[photorealistic]] attention to detail, despite Vermeer's having had no formal training, and despite only limited evidence that Vermeer had created any preparatory sketches or traces for his paintings.{{CN|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn 2001, British artist [[David Hockney]] published the book ''Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters'', in which he argued that Vermeer (among other Renaissance and Baroque artists including [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]] and [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]) used optics to achieve precise positioning in their compositions, and specifically some combination of [[curved mirror]]s, [[camera obscura]], and [[camera lucida]]. This became known as the [[Hockney\u2013Falco thesis]], named after Hockney and [[Charles M. Falco]], another proponent of the theory.\n\nProfessor Philip Steadman published the book ''Vermeer's Camera: Uncovering the Truth behind the Masterpieces'' in 2001 which specifically claimed that Vermeer had used a camera obscura to create his paintings. Steadman noted that many of Vermeer's paintings had been painted in the same room, and he found six of his paintings that are precisely the right size if they had been painted from inside a camera obscura in the room's back wall.<ref name=BBC_Steadman/>\n\nSupporters of these theories have pointed to evidence in some of Vermeer's paintings, such as the often-discussed sparkling pearly highlights in Vermeer's paintings, which they argue are the result of the primitive lens of a camera obscura producing [[halo (optical phenomenon)|halation]]. It was also postulated that a camera obscura was the mechanical cause of the \"exaggerated\" perspective seen in ''[[The Music Lesson]]'' (London, [[Royal Collection]]).{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn 2008, American entrepreneur and inventor [[Tim Jenison]] developed the theory that Vermeer had used a camera obscura along with a \"comparator mirror\", which is similar in concept to a [[camera lucida]] but much simpler and makes it easy to match color values. He later modified the theory to simply involve a concave mirror and a comparator mirror. He spent the next five years testing his theory by attempting to re-create ''The Music Lesson'' himself using these tools, a process captured in the 2013 documentary film ''[[Tim's Vermeer]]''.<ref name=Vanity/>\n\nSeveral points were brought out by Jenison in support of this technique: first was Vermeer's hyper-accurate rendition of light falloff along the wall. Neurobiologist [[Colin Blakemore]], in an interview with Jenison, notes that human vision cannot process information about the absolute brightness of a scene.<ref name=Tims/> Another was the addition of several highlights and outlines consistent with matching the effects of [[chromatic aberration]], particularly noticeable in primitive optics. Last, and perhaps most telling, is a noticeable curvature in the original painting's rendition of the scrollwork on the harpsichord. This effect matched Jenison's technique precisely, caused by exactly duplicating the view as seen from a curved mirror.\n\nThis theory remains disputed. There is no historical evidence regarding Vermeer's interest in optics, aside from the accurately observed mirror reflection above the lady at the virginals in ''[[The Music Lesson]]''. The detailed inventory of the artist's belongings drawn up after his death does not include a camera obscura or any similar device.<ref name=Obscura/> However, Vermeer was in close connection with pioneer lens maker [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] and Leeuwenhoek was his executor after death.<ref name=bryson/>\n\n==Works==\n{{See also|List of paintings by Johannes Vermeer|Category:Johannes Vermeer }}\nVermeer produced a total of fewer than 50 paintings, of which 34 have survived.<ref name=\"veconomist\">{{cite news|title=Vermeer was brilliant, but he was not without influences|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21730134-blockbuster-show-punctures-myth-solitary-genius-vermeer-was-brilliant-he|work=[[The Economist]]|date=12 October 2017}}</ref> Only three Vermeer paintings were dated by the artist: ''[[The Procuress (Vermeer)|The Procuress]]'' (1656; Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, Dresden); ''[[The Astronomer (painting)|The Astronomer]]'' (1668; Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris); and ''[[The Geographer]]'' (1669; St\u00e4delsches Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt).\n\nVermeer's mother-in-law Maria Thins owned [[Dirck van Baburen]]'s 1622 oil-on-canvas ''[[The Procuress (Dirck van Baburen)|The Procuress]]'' (or a copy of it), which appears in the background of two of Vermeer's paintings. The same subject was also painted by Vermeer. Almost all of Vermeer's paintings are of contemporary subjects in a smaller format, with a cooler palette dominated by blues, yellows, and grays. Practically all of his surviving works belong to this period, usually domestic interiors with one or two figures lit by a window on the left. They are characterized by a sense of compositional balance and spatial order, unified by a pearly light. Mundane domestic or recreational activities are imbued with a poetic timelessness (e.g., ''[[Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window]]'', Dresden, Gem\u00e4ldegalerie). Vermeer's two [[townscape]]s have also been attributed to this period: ''[[View of Delft]]'' (The Hague, Mauritshuis) and ''[[The Little Street (Vermeer)|''A street in Delft'']]'' (Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum).\n\nA few of his paintings show a certain hardening of manner and are generally thought to represent his late works. From this period come ''[[The Allegory of Faith]]'' (c. 1670; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) and ''[[The Love Letter (Vermeer)|The Love Letter]]'' (c. 1670; Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam).\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Th\u00e9ophile_Thor\u00e9_by_Nadar.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Th\u00e9ophile Thor\u00e9-B\u00fcrger]]]]\nOriginally, Vermeer's works were largely overlooked by art historians for two centuries after his death.

The work takes its title from the [[Lutheran hymn]] \"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\", with poetry by [[Johann Franck]] and a [[Chorale|chorale melody]] by [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]. [[Movement (music)|Movements]] based on the six [[stanza]]s of the hymn are interspersed with five movements based on passages from the [[Epistle to the Romans]]. The Biblical text, which contains key [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] teaching, is contrasted by the hymn, written in the first person with a focus on emotion, and Bach set both with attention to dramatic detail {{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} in a symmetrical structure of eleven movements. Bach set the [[chorale]] tune in various ways, from a four-part setting which begins and ends the work, to a [[chorale fantasia]] and a free setting which only paraphrases the tune. Four verses from the Epistle are set in [[motet]] style, two four five voices, and two for three voices. The central movement is a five-part [[Fugue (music)|fugue]].  Bach used [[word painting]] to intensify the theological meaning of both hymn and Epistle texts.\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is one of few works by Bach for five vocal parts. It may have been composed for a funeral, but scholars doubt a 1912 dating to a specific funeral in Leipzig on 18 July 1723. Chorale settings from the motet were included in the [[Dietel manuscript]], a collection of Bach's chorales from {{circa|1735}}. At least one of the eleven movements seems to date to a period before Bach's post in Leipzig. [[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that it may have been composed for education in both choral singing and theology. The motet, unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text, has been regarded as one of Bach's greatest motets.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} It was the first of his motets to be recorded, in 1927.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Jesu Meine Freude Praxis Cruger 1653.jpeg|thumb|upright|\"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\" in Johann Cr\u00fcger's ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]'', 1653]]\nIn the context of late 17th-century [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Germany, where and when [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ancestors composed their motets\u2014a collection of which was preserved in the {{lang|de|[[Altbachisches Archiv]]}}\u2014, motets were choral compositions, mostly with more independent voices than a standard [[SATB]] choir, and with a text from sacred scripture and/or based on a [[Lutheran hymn]]. In the latter case, the [[Lutheran chorale|corresponding chorale tune]] was usually adopted into the composition. Instrumental accompaniment was often limited to [[basso continuo]] and/or instruments playing ''[[colla parte]]''. By the time Bach started to compose his motets along these principles in the 1810s or 1820s, motets were regarded an antiquated genre. Bach composed most of [[church cantata (Bach)|his church cantatas]] for occasions of the [[Liturgical calendar (Lutheran)|Lutheran liturgical calendar]] of the time and place where he was occupied. Church cantatas for weddings and funerals fall outside such scheme, and also [[Motet (Bach)|his motets]] appear to belong in this latter category.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} Among around 15 extant compositions which at some point or another were designated as a motet by Bach ([[BWV&nbsp;118]], [[motet (Bach)|225\u2013231]], [[BWV Anh.|Anh.]]&nbsp;159\u2013165, [[Der Gerechte k\u00f6mmt um|deest]]),<ref>{{cite book |date=1998 |editor1-last=D\u00fcrr |editor1-first=Alfred |editor1-link=Alfred D\u00fcrr |editor2-last=Kobayashi |editor2-first=Yoshitake |title=[[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis|Bach Werke Verzeichnis: Kleine Ausgabe \u2013 Nach der von Wolfgang Schmieder vorgelegten 2.

The melody of the first line is the same as that of the last line.{{sfn|Hymnary tune|2020}} As a key teaching of the Lutheran faith, the Gospel text reflects on Jesus Christ freeing man from sin and death, focused on the contrast of living \"in the flesh\" or \"according to the Spirit\".{{sfn|May|2020}} The hymn text is written from an individual believer's point of view, addressing Jesus as joy and support, against enemies and the vanity of existence, which are expressed in stark images.

The work takes its title from the [[Lutheran hymn]] \"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\", with poetry by [[Johann Franck]] and a [[Chorale|chorale melody]] by [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]. [[Movement (music)|Movements]] based on the six [[stanza]]s of the hymn are interspersed with five movements based on passages from the [[Epistle to the Romans]]. The Biblical text, which contains key [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] teaching, is contrasted by the hymn, written in the first person with a focus on emotion, and Bach set both with attention to dramatic detail {{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} in a symmetrical structure of eleven movements. Bach set the [[chorale]] tune in various ways, from a four-part setting which begins and ends the work, to a [[chorale fantasia]] and a free setting which only paraphrases the tune. Four verses from the Epistle are set in [[motet]] style, two four five voices, and two for three voices. The central movement is a five-part [[Fugue (music)|fugue]].  Bach used [[word painting]] to intensify the theological meaning of both hymn and Epistle texts.\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is one of few works by Bach for five vocal parts. It may have been composed for a funeral, but scholars doubt a 1912 dating to a specific funeral in Leipzig on 18 July 1723. Chorale settings from the motet were included in the [[Dietel manuscript]], a collection of Bach's chorales from {{circa|1735}}. At least one of the eleven movements seems to date to a period before Bach's post in Leipzig. [[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that it may have been composed for education in both choral singing and theology. The motet, unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text, has been regarded as one of Bach's greatest motets.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} It was the first of his motets to be recorded, in 1927.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\n[[Johann Sebastian Bach]] composed most of [[church cantata (Bach)|his church cantatas]] for occasions of the [[Liturgical calendar (Lutheran)|Lutheran liturgical calendar]] of the time and place where he was occupied.

In the latter case, the [[Lutheran chorale|corresponding chorale tune]] was usually adopted into the composition. Instrumental accompaniment was often limited to [[basso continuo]] and/or instruments playing ''[[colla parte]]''. By the time Bach started to compose his motets along these principles in the 1810s or 1820s, motets were regarded an antiquated genre.\n\nIn eleven movements, {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is the longest and most musically complex of Bach's motets.{{sfn|Ameln|1965}}{{sfn|Robins|2020}} It is scored for SSATB voices.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}} Bach composed only very few works for a five-part choir: most of his other motets are for double SATB choir.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}} Like for most of his other motets, no continuo or other instrumental accompaniment has survived for BWV&nbsp;227, but it is surmised there used to be one.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}}{{sfn|Melamed|1995}} The text for {{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]}} is compiled from two sources, the 1653 {{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude|hymn of the same name]]|italic=no}} with words by [[Johann Franck]], and Bible verses from the [[Epistle to the Romans]] 8:1\u20132, 9\u201311.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} In the motet, the six hymn stanzas form the odd movement numbers, while the even numbers take as their text one verse from the Epistle writing.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}}\n\nThe hymn's [[stanza]]s are in [[bar form]].{{sfn|Hymnary tune|2020}} Its first line, which [[Catherine Winkworth]] translated as \"Jesu, priceless treasure\" in 1869,{{sfn|CCEL|2020}} is repeated as the last line of the last stanza, framing the poetry.{{sfn|Hymnary text|2020}} The chorale melody was composed by [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]] (1653) and first appeared in his hymnal ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]''. The melody of the first line is the same as that of the last line.{{sfn|Hymnary tune|2020}} As a key teaching of the Lutheran faith, the Gospel text reflects on Jesus Christ freeing man from sin and death, focused on the contrast of living \"in the flesh\" or \"according to the Spirit\".{{sfn|May|2020}} The hymn text is written from an individual believer's point of view, addressing Jesus as joy and support, against enemies and the vanity of existence, which are expressed in stark images. The hymn adds a layer of individuality and emotions to the Biblical teaching.{{sfn|Schmidt|2011}}\n\nMost of Bach's motets are difficult to date, and {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is no exception.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA98 98]}}{{sfn|Graulich|Wolf|2002|p=V}} Bach's biographer [[Philipp Spitta]] assigned the motets, including {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}}, to Bach's Leipzig years.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85], [https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA98 98]}} In 1912, Bernhard Friedrich Richter wrote that {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} was likely written for the funeral of Johanna Maria Kees, the wife of the Leipzig postmaster, on 18 July 1723, because a scripture reading of verse 11 from the Epistle passage set in the motet, in the tenth movement, is documented for the funeral.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA85 85]}}{{sfn|Hofmann|1995|p=IV}} The Cambridge musicologist Daniel R.

P. Jones]] said that several movements show a style too advanced to have been written in 1723, and assumed that the final arrangement of the work happened in the late 1720s, when two other motets were also written that can be dated with more certainty, ''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'' and the funeral motet [[Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226|''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', BWV 226]].{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}}\n\nThe [[Dietel manuscript]], written around 1735, contains three chorales extracted from the motet, thus the composition of the motet is supposed to have been completed before that time.{{sfn|Bach Digital|2020}}{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ronZdkhQouMC&pg=PA329 329]}}\n\n== Music ==\n=== Structure and scoring ===\nThe motet is structured in eleven movements, with text alternating a chorale stanza and a passage from the Epistle.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} Bach scored it for a choir of two [[soprano]] parts (S or SS), [[alto]] (A), [[tenor]] (T) and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] (B).

Originally released on October 24, 1991, by [[Walt Disney Records]], the album's first half \u2013 tracks 2 to 9 \u2013 generally contains the film's [[Number (music)|musical number]]<nowiki/>s, all of which were written by composer [[Alan Menken]] and lyricist [[Howard Ashman]], while its latter half \u2013 tracks 10 to 14 \u2013 features its <nowiki/>[[Film score|musical score]], composed solely by Menken. While the majority of the album's content remains within the [[musical theatre]] genre, its songs have also been influenced by [[Music of France|French]], [[Classical music|classical]], [[pop music|pop]] and [[Broadway musical|Broadway music]]. Credited to Various Artists, ''Beauty and the Beast: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack'' features performances by the film's main cast \u2013 [[Paige O'Hara]], [[Richard White (actor)|Richard White]], [[Jesse Corti]], [[Jerry Orbach]], [[Angela Lansbury]] and [[Robby Benson]] \u2013 in order of appearance. Additionally, the album features recording artists [[Celine Dion]] and [[Peabo Bryson]], who perform a pop rendition of the film's [[theme song|title and theme song]], \"Beauty and the Beast\", which simultaneously serves as the soundtrack's only single.\n\nFollowing a difficult period during where [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]] struggled to release successful animated feature films, the studio, inspired by their most recent animated success ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]] ''(1989), decided to adapt the fairy tale \"[[Beauty and the Beast]]\" into an [[Musical film|animated musical film]] after a non-musical adaptation had been attempted that failed to impress [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], the chairman of Walt Disney Studios. Katzenberg ordered that production on the film be started over from scratch, hiring songwriting team Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, who had just recently completed scoring ''The Little Mermaid'', to write the film's songs. Dion and Bryson were hired to record a pop version of \u2013 and draw media attention to \u2013 the film's title song. Ashman, who was initially hesitant to join the project, died of [[AIDS]] before the film's completion and the album's release.\n\nMuch like ''Beauty and the Beast'', the soundtrack was a massive critical success, receiving universal praise and recognition from both film and music critics. The music featured on the album won several awards, including the [[49th Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], the [[64th Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Score]] and the [[35th Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] for [[Best Instrumental Composition Written for a Motion Picture or for Television]]. Its title track and only single, \"[[Beauty and the Beast (Disney song)|Beauty and the Beast]]\", achieved similar success, winning the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] and Grammy Awards for both [[Best song written for visual media|Best Song Written for Visual Media]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]]. The soundtrack was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Album of the Year.\n\nIn December 2001, the soundtrack was re-released as a ''Special Edition'' to coincide with the [[IMAX]] re-issue of the film and the upcoming two-disc [[Walt Disney Platinum and Diamond Editions#Soundtracks|Platinum Edition]]. The new release featured the film version of \"Transformation\", which had been replaced with an early unused version in some early pressings, the newly animated song \"Human Again\", the original instrumental intended for the \"Transformation\" scene, (titled \"Death of the Beast (Early Version)\" here) and demos for \"Be Our Guest\" and the title track. In September 2010, the soundtrack was re-released again as a [[Walt Disney Platinum and Diamond Editions#Music releases|Diamond Edition]] soundtrack, to coincide with the successful Blu-ray and DVD Diamond Edition release of the film, the 1991 version of the soundtrack was released and included [[Jordin Sparks]]' cover of \"Beauty and the Beast\" as a bonus track. The soundtrack was [[reissue|reissued]] as the fourteenth entry in ''[[Walt Disney Records the Legacy Collection|The Legacy Collection]]'' on February 9, 2018 and includes previously unreleased score.\n\n==Background==\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]] struggled to release animated feature films that achieved the levels of success of some of the studio's earlier productions did. In 1989, [[Walt Disney Pictures]] released ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]. ''An [[Musical film|animated musical]] that features songs written by lyricist [[Howard Ashman]] and composer [[Alan Menken]], ''The Little Mermaid'' was both a tremendous critical and commercial success. Hoping to release a film that achieved similar success, the studio decided to adapt the fairy tale \"[[Beauty and the Beast]]\" by [[Jeanne-Marie Le Prince de Beaumont]] into an animated film.\n\nPrior to getting professionally involved with Disney, Ashman and Menken had collaborated on a [[Little Shop of Horrors (1960 film)|musical adaptation]] of ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'' and its subsequent musical [[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|film adaptation]]. Following the studio's attempt to adapt the fairy tale into a non-musical animated film under the direction of Richard Purdum, Disney CEO [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], dissatisfied by the direction in which the film was headed, ordered that it be scrapped and restarted from scratch, this time in the form of a musical. In addition to hiring a screenwriter, Katzenberg recruited Ashman and Menken to write the film's songs.\n\n===Ashman's health===\nAshman was initially reluctant to agree to work on ''Beauty and the Beast'' because he had just recently been diagnosed with [[AIDS]]. Additionally, he had already begun writing songs for ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]] ''(1992). Ashman's health began deteriorating soon after he completed ''The Little Mermaid''. However, he wanted his illness to remain secret and decided to tell few about it. Too weak to travel, Ashman requested that he be allowed to work on the film's songs from his home, causing Menken and the filmmakers to frequently travel from the film's studio in [[Burbank, California]] to his home in New York in order to collaborate with him. Ashman wrote the majority of the song's lyrics from his deathbed.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/beauty-and-the-plague|title = Beauty and the Plague|website = Vice|publisher = Vice|accessdate = 18 September 2013|last = Sunderland|first = Mitchell}}</ref><ref>https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/03/beauty-and-the-beast-gay-lefou-howard-ashman</ref><ref>https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/16583/don-Hahn-interview-beauty-and-the-beast-howard-Ashman-the-lion-king-south-park-and-frankenweenie</ref>\n\n==Content and composition==\nLyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken intended for the songs in ''Beauty and the Beast'' to serve as [[plot device]]s and assist in the telling of its story.

Originally released on October 24, 1991, by [[Walt Disney Records]], the album's first half \u2013 tracks 2 to 9 \u2013 generally contains the film's [[Number (music)|musical number]]<nowiki/>s, all of which were written by composer [[Alan Menken]] and lyricist [[Howard Ashman]], while its latter half \u2013 tracks 10 to 14 \u2013 features its <nowiki/>[[Film score|musical score]], composed solely by Menken. While the majority of the album's content remains within the [[musical theatre]] genre, its songs have also been influenced by [[Music of France|French]], [[Classical music|classical]], [[pop music|pop]] and [[Broadway musical|Broadway music]]. Credited to Various Artists, ''Beauty and the Beast: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack'' features performances by the film's main cast \u2013 [[Paige O'Hara]], [[Richard White (actor)|Richard White]], [[Jesse Corti]], [[Jerry Orbach]], [[Angela Lansbury]] and [[Robby Benson]] \u2013 in order of appearance. Additionally, the album features recording artists [[Celine Dion]] and [[Peabo Bryson]], who perform a pop rendition of the film's [[theme song|title and theme song]], \"Beauty and the Beast\", which simultaneously serves as the soundtrack's only single.\n\nFollowing a difficult period during where [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]] struggled to release successful animated feature films, the studio, inspired by their most recent animated success ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]] ''(1989), decided to adapt the fairy tale \"[[Beauty and the Beast]]\" into an [[Musical film|animated musical film]] after a non-musical adaptation had been attempted that failed to impress [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], the chairman of Walt Disney Studios. Katzenberg ordered that production on the film be started over from scratch, hiring songwriting team Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, who had just recently completed scoring ''The Little Mermaid'', to write the film's songs. Dion and Bryson were hired to record a pop version of \u2013 and draw media attention to \u2013 the film's title song. Ashman, who was initially hesitant to join the project, died of [[AIDS]] before the film's completion and the album's release.\n\nMuch like ''Beauty and the Beast'', the soundtrack was a massive critical success, receiving universal praise and recognition from both film and music critics. The music featured on the album won several awards, including the [[49th Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], the [[64th Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Score]] and the [[35th Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] for [[Best Instrumental Composition Written for a Motion Picture or for Television]]. Its title track and only single, \"[[Beauty and the Beast (Disney song)|Beauty and the Beast]]\", achieved similar success, winning the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] and Grammy Awards for both [[Best song written for visual media|Best Song Written for Visual Media]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]]. The soundtrack was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Album of the Year.\n\nIn December 2001, the soundtrack was re-released as a ''Special Edition'' to coincide with the [[IMAX]] re-issue of the film and the upcoming two-disc [[Walt Disney Platinum and Diamond Editions#Soundtracks|Platinum Edition]]. The new release featured the film version of \"Transformation\", which had been replaced with an early unused version in some early pressings, the newly animated song \"Human Again\", the original instrumental intended for the \"Transformation\" scene, (titled \"Death of the Beast (Early Version)\" here) and demos for \"Be Our Guest\" and the title track. In September 2010, the soundtrack was re-released again as a [[Walt Disney Platinum and Diamond Editions#Music releases|Diamond Edition]] soundtrack, to coincide with the successful Blu-ray and DVD Diamond Edition release of the film, the 1991 version of the soundtrack was released and included [[Jordin Sparks]]' cover of \"Beauty and the Beast\" as a bonus track. The soundtrack was [[reissue|reissued]] as the fourteenth entry in ''[[Walt Disney Records the Legacy Collection|The Legacy Collection]]'' on February 9, 2018 and includes previously unreleased score.\n\n==Background==\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]] struggled to release animated feature films that achieved the levels of success of some of the studio's earlier productions did. In 1989, [[Walt Disney Pictures]] released ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]. ''An [[Musical film|animated musical]] that features songs written by lyricist [[Howard Ashman]] and composer [[Alan Menken]], ''The Little Mermaid'' was both a tremendous critical and commercial success. Hoping to release a film that achieved similar success, the studio decided to adapt the fairy tale \"[[Beauty and the Beast]]\" by [[Jeanne-Marie Le Prince de Beaumont]] into an animated film.\n\nPrior to getting professionally involved with Disney, Ashman and Menken had collaborated on a [[Little Shop of Horrors (1960 film)|musical adaptation]] of ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'' and its subsequent musical [[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|film adaptation]]. Following the studio's attempt to adapt the fairy tale into a non-musical animated film under the direction of Richard Purdum, Disney CEO [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], dissatisfied by the direction in which the film was headed, ordered that it be scrapped and restarted from scratch, this time in the form of a musical. In addition to hiring a screenwriter, Katzenberg recruited Ashman and Menken to write the film's songs.\n\n===Ashman's health===\nAshman was initially reluctant to agree to work on ''Beauty and the Beast'' because he had just recently been diagnosed with [[AIDS]]. Additionally, he had already begun writing songs for ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]] ''(1992). Ashman's health began deteriorating soon after he completed ''The Little Mermaid''. However, he wanted his illness to remain secret and decided to tell few about it. Too weak to travel, Ashman requested that he be allowed to work on the film's songs from his home, causing Menken and the filmmakers to frequently travel from the film's studio in [[Burbank, California]] to his home in New York in order to collaborate with him. Ashman wrote the majority of the song's lyrics from his deathbed.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/beauty-and-the-plague|title = Beauty and the Plague|website = Vice|publisher = Vice|accessdate = 18 September 2013|last = Sunderland|first = Mitchell}}</ref><ref>https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/03/beauty-and-the-beast-gay-lefou-howard-ashman</ref><ref>https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/16583/don-Hahn-interview-beauty-and-the-beast-howard-Ashman-the-lion-king-south-park-and-frankenweenie</ref>\n\n==Content and composition==\nLyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken intended for the songs in ''Beauty and the Beast'' to serve as [[plot device]]s and assist in the telling of its story.

Tavia Hobart of [[AllMusic]] awarded the soundtrack a nearly perfect overall score of 4.5/5 stars, describing Ashman and Menken's compositions as \"positively delightful.\" However, she felt that the album's orchestral score was not as good as ''[[The Little Mermaid (soundtrack)|The Little Mermaid]]''<nowiki/>. [[Filmtracks.com|Filmtracks]] <nowiki/>was very enthusiastic about the album, praising each of its songs and labeling them \"remarkably upbeat\".

[[Sputnikmusic|Sputnikmusik]]'s Irving Tan awarded the album a \"superb\" overall rating of 4.5/5.

Their finds were presented by Kermack to the [[Linnean Society of London]] on October 8th, 1953, and was recognised belonging to a \"primitive crocodile or crocodile ancestor\". No osteoderms had been identified yet at the time, which Kermack regarded as representing a \"[[Missing_link_(human_evolution)|missing link]]\" between modern crocodilians and the Triassic \"[[thecodonts]]\". The fossils included several well-preserved articulated partial skeletons and various isolated bones. Kermack refrained from naming the animal or nominating a type specimen, as preparation of the fossils was still ongoing. The specimens were eventually named and thoroughly described by P. J. Crush in 1984, with the [[generic name (biology)|generic name]] ''Terrestrisuchus'' chosen to emphasise the terrestrial lifestyle of this crocodylomorph, and the [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] from the [[Latin]] ''gracilis'' for its light, graceful build.<ref name=\"crush84\"/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Kermack |first=K.

No osteoderms had been identified yet at the time, which Kermack regarded as representing a \"[[Missing_link_(human_evolution)|missing link]]\" between modern crocodilians and the Triassic \"[[thecodonts]]\". The fossils included several well-preserved articulated partial skeletons and various isolated bones. Kermack refrained from naming the animal or nominating a type specimen, as preparation of the fossils was still ongoing. The specimens were eventually named and thoroughly described by P. J. Crush in 1984, with the [[generic name]] ''Terrestrisuchus'' chosen to emphasise the terrestrial lifestyle of this crocodylomorph, and the [[specific name]] from the [[Latin]] ''gracilis'' for its light, graceful build.<ref name=\"crush84\"/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Kermack |first=K.

[[Rhynchocephalia]]ns (relatives of modern [[tuatara]]s) were very abundant and are known from at least three species including ''[[Clevosaurus|Clevosaurus cambrica]]'', ''[[Diphydontosaurus]]'' and at least one or two unnamed species, which likely formed a large part of the diet of ''Terrestrisuchus'' (possibly evidenced by bite marks on the bones of ''Clevosaurus'' that likely belong to ''Terrestrisuchus''). ''Terrestrisuchus'' was a relatively rare component of the island's fauna, an expected relationship for a predatory animal.<ref name=\"Clevo\">{{cite journal |last1=Keeble |first1=Emily |last2=Whitestide |first2=David I. |last3=Benton |first3=Michael J. |year=2018 |title=The terrestrial fauna of the Late Triassic Pant-y-ffynnon Quarry fissures, South Wales, UK and a new species of ''Clevosaurus'' (Lepidosauria: Rhynchocephalia) |journal=[[Proceedings of the Geologists' Association]] |volume=129 |issue=2 |pages=99\u2013119 |doi=10.1016/j.pgeola.2017.11.001 |url=https://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/files/149334438/PantyF_MS_revised.pdf|hdl=1983/5afdc677-3ea0-4519-813d-6052ef8370ec }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Portalbar|Wales|Paleontology}}\n{{Pseudosuchia|L.}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q981048}}\n\n[[Category:Late Triassic reptiles of Europe]]\n[[Category:Terrestrial crocodylomorphs]]\n[[Category:Triassic crocodylomorpha]]\n[[Category:Fossil taxa described in 1984]]\n[[Category:Paleontology in Wales]]\n[[Category:Paleontology in England]]\n[[Category:Rhaetian first appearances]]\n[[Category:Rhaetian extinctions]]\n", "name_user": "DrawingDinosaurs", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguated:pubis\u2192pubis (bone),generic name\u2192generic name (biology),specific name\u2192specific name (zoology)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrisuchus"}
