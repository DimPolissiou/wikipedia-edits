The characters of [[Fred Flintstone]], [[Barney Rubble]] and [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] were only featured together during the opening title sequence and in brief bumpers between segments.<ref name=Daytime>{{cite book |last1=Hyatt |first1=Wesley |title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television |date=1997 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |isbn=978-0823083152 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofda00hyat/page/160/mode/2up|accessdate=19 March 2020|page=160}}</ref> The unusual combination of a Marvel superhero and ''The Flintstones'' was possible because, at this time, [[Marvel Comics]] owned the rights to several Hanna-Barbera franchises and were, in fact, publishing comic books based upon them; ''The Flintstones'' was one of these.\n\nFor the 1979\u201380 season, the series was expanded to a 90-minute timeslot with the addition of ''[[The New Shmoo]]'' episodes and broadcast under the new title '''''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'''''.\n\nLike many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a [[Laugh track#Making their own|laugh track]], one of their last productions to do so.\n\n==The Thing==\nThe first segment, a very loose adaptation of [[Marvel Comics]]' character the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], consisted of stories following the adventures of a scrawny, red-headed teenager named Benjy Grimm (voiced by Wayne Morton)<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=210}}</ref> who changes into the monstrous and mighty Thing (voiced by Joe Baker) by touching together magic rings and reciting the words \"Thing ring, do your thing!\", releasing an explosion of energy that causes orange rocks to hurl in from every direction and transform him into the stone-skinned superhero. When the Thing spoke, his good-naturedly gruff [[Brooklyn]]-accented voice was based on that of comedian [[Jimmy Durante]].\n\nThe stories centered mostly around Benjy at Centerville High School with his friends, the beautiful brunette Betty (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]), her snooty rich boyfriend Ronald Radford (voiced by [[John Erwin]]), and Betty's blond [[tomboy]] younger sister Kelly (voiced by Noelle North), with minimal adult supervision provided by teacher Miss Twilly (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]). Only Kelly and her scientist father Dr. Harkness (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) know Benjy's secret identity.\n\nWhen not battling various [[mad scientist]]s and getting involved in [[Scooby-Doo]]-style mysteries, the Thing spent most of his time using his superhuman strength to protect his pals from everyday dangers and the nasty [[practical joke]]s of leather-clad bully Spike (voiced by [[Art Metrano]]) and his biker buddies Stretch and Turkey in the [[Yancy Street Gang]].\n \nOther members of the [[Fantastic Four]] did not appear in the show, and the portrayal of the Thing and his origin story differed greatly from the original comics.<ref>{{cite news|title= Fantastic Four on TV|newspaper= [[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/797/797130p2.html|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTwenty-six 11-minute episodes of ''The Thing'' were produced; two shorts aired per show.\n\n''The Thing'' segments are owned by [[WarnerMedia]], through [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]], but the character is owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]] due to their purchase of Marvel Comics in late 2009.\n\n===Other appearances===\nIn ''[[Future Foundation|FF]]'' #8,

(comics)|Thing]])\n\nDespite the show's title, the two segments remained separate and did not cross over with one another. The characters of [[Fred Flintstone]], [[Barney Rubble]] and [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] were only featured together during the opening title sequence and in brief bumpers between segments.<ref name=Daytime>{{cite book |last1=Hyatt |first1=Wesley |title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television |date=1997 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |isbn=978-0823083152 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofda00hyat/page/160/mode/2up|accessdate=19 March 2020|page=160}}</ref> The unusual combination of a Marvel superhero and ''The Flintstones'' was possible because, at this time, [[Marvel Comics]] owned the rights to several Hanna-Barbera franchises and were, in fact, publishing comic books based upon them; ''The Flintstones'' was one of these.\n\nFor the 1979\u201380 season, the series was expanded to a 90-minute timeslot with the addition of ''[[The New Shmoo]]'' episodes and broadcast under the new title '''''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'''''.\n\nLike many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a [[Laugh track#Making their own|laugh track]], one of their last productions to do so.\n\n==The Thing==\nThe first segment, a very loose adaptation of [[Marvel Comics]]' character the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], consisted of stories following the adventures of a scrawny, red-headed teenager named Benjy Grimm (voiced by Wayne Morton)<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=210}}</ref> who changes into the monstrous and mighty Thing (voiced by Joe Baker) by touching together magic rings and reciting the words \"Thing ring, do your thing!\", releasing an explosion of energy that causes orange rocks to hurl in from every direction and transform him into the stone-skinned superhero. When the Thing spoke, his good-naturedly gruff [[Brooklyn]]-accented voice was based on that of comedian [[Jimmy Durante]].\n\nThe stories centered mostly around Benjy at Centerville High School with his friends, the beautiful brunette Betty (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]), her snooty rich boyfriend Ronald Radford (voiced by [[John Erwin]]), and Betty's blond [[tomboy]] younger sister Kelly (voiced by Noelle North), with minimal adult supervision provided by teacher Miss Twilly (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]). Only Kelly and her scientist father Dr. Harkness (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) know Benjy's secret identity.\n\nWhen not battling various [[mad scientist]]s and getting involved in [[Scooby-Doo]]-style mysteries, the Thing spent most of his time using his superhuman strength to protect his pals from everyday dangers and the nasty [[practical joke]]s of leather-clad bully Spike (voiced by [[Art Metrano]]) and his biker buddies Stretch and Turkey in the [[Yancy Street Gang]].\n \nOther members of the [[Fantastic Four]] did not appear in the show, and the portrayal of the Thing and his origin story differed greatly from the original comics.<ref>{{cite news|title= Fantastic Four on TV|newspaper= [[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/797/797130p2.html|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTwenty-six 11-minute episodes of ''The Thing'' were produced; two shorts aired per show.\n\n''The Thing'' segments are owned by [[WarnerMedia]], through [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]], but the character is owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]] due to their purchase of Marvel Comics in late 2009.\n\n===Other appearances===\nIn ''[[Future Foundation|FF]]'' #8,

He started his career as a restaurant manager and insurance salesman in Italy. Briatore was convicted in Italy on several fraud charges in the 1980s, receiving two prison sentences, though the convictions were later extinguished by an amnesty. Briatore set up a number of successful [[Benetton Group|Benetton]] [[franchising|franchises]] as a fugitive in the [[Virgin Islands]] and the United States.  In 1990, he was promoted by [[Luciano Benetton]] to manage the Benetton [[Formula One]] racing team, which became [[Renault F1]] in 2002.  From 2007 to 2010, he was part-owner and chairman of London's [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.]] On 16 September 2009, Briatore was forced to resign from the ING Renault F1 team due to his involvement in [[Renault Formula One crash controversy|race fixing]] at the [[2008 Singapore Grand Prix]].  After the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA) conducted its own investigation, Briatore was banned indefinitely from any events sanctioned by the FIA, although this ban was later overturned by a French [[Tribunal d'instance|Tribunal de Grande Instance]].\n\n== Early life and Benetton career ==\nBriatore was born in [[Verzuolo]] near [[Cuneo]], Italy, in the [[Maritime Alps]], to a family of elementary school teachers. After twice failing public (state) school, he attended a private (independent) school, receiving a diploma with the lowest grades in Land Surveying at Fassino di Busca high school.<ref name=\"repubblica.it\"/> Briatore found early work as a ski instructor and restaurant manager.

When Benetton opened his first five stores in the United States in 1979, he appointed Briatore as director of the group's American operations. Thanks to Benetton's methods of franchising, the chain experienced a brief boom in popularity in the US, where, by 1989, there were 800 Benetton stores. Briatore, having taken a cut of each franchising agreement, became very wealthy.

If Renault committed a comparable offence between 2009 and 2011, it was to be indefinitely banned from F1.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/78770|title=Renault given two-year suspended ban|first=Jonathan|last=Noble|publisher=Autosport.com|date=21 September 2009|accessdate=21 September 2009}}</ref> British newspaper ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'' described the ban as the harshest sanction ever imposed on an individual in the history of motorsport.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/crashgate-renault-owner-flavio-briatore-420079|title=Renault owner Flavio Briatore slapped with lifetime F1 ban|first=Byron|last=Young|publisher=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=21 September 2009|accessdate=21 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nBriatore later said he was \"distraught\" at the FIA's action and sued the FIA in French courts to clear his name.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/22/flavio-briatore-f1-ban|title=Flavio Briatore left 'distraught' by Formula One lifetime ban|publisher=The Guardian|date=22 September 2009|accessdate=25 September 2009 | location=London}}</ref> On 5 January 2010, the [[Tribunal d'instance|Tribunal de Grande Instance]] overturned the ban and granted him \u20ac15,000 in compensation.<ref>[http://en.espnf1.com/f1/motorsport/story/6063.html Flavio Briatore's ban overturned by French court | Formula 1 | Formula 1 news, live F1 | ESPN F1<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The tribunal declared in particular that \"the decision of the World Council was presided over by the FIA president, who was well known to be in conflict with Briatore, with Mr Mosley having played a leading role in launching the inquiry and its investigation in violation of the principle of separation of the power of the bodies\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/jan/05/flavio-briatore-fia-court-decision.html |title=Flavio Briatore FIA Court Decision |date=5 January 2010 |work=The Guardian}} {{Dead link|date=May 2016}}</ref> The FIA announced that it would appeal the decision issued by the French court, but the two parties reached an out-of-court settlement the following April.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/8452410.stm FIA to appeal Briatore decision] BBC</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Elizalde|first=Pablo|title=FIA, Briatore reach settlement|publisher=[[Haymarket Media Group|Haymarket Publications]]|work=autosport.com|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/82844|date=12 April 2010|accessdate=12 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Gazzetta dello Sport]]'', Briatore said that he is sure that he will not return to Formula One, despite having his ban overturned.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lostia|first=Michele|author2=Elizalde, Pablo|title=Briatore rules out returning to F1|publisher=[[Haymarket Media Group|Haymarket Publications]]|work=autosport.com|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/82014|date=12 March 2010|accessdate=19 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Stance on the future of F1===\nBriatore has always spoken out about his desires to see F1 provide better entertainment. In 1994, he said: \"All the team owners are orientated towards the technical side rather than the entertainment side, and this is a big fault.

Nobody goes to a race to see that kind of thing\u2026 People come to see Schumacher and Senna racing each other.\"<ref name=\"briatoref1fbio\" />\n\nTwelve years later his feelings were much the same: \"The people in charge should be businessmen, as they are in Hollywood, not ex-engineers.

This is a marine sand of [[Jurassic]] age ([[Bajocian]] stage), deposited as part of an estuary sequence and overlain by a sequence of limestones and mudrocks. Significant amounts of the sand have been replaced or displaced by iron minerals, giving an average ore grade of around 25 [[Concentration#Mass percentage (fraction)|wt%]] iron. To the west the iron ores have been moderately exploited for a very long time, but their high phosphorus content made them difficult to smelt and produced iron of poor quality until the development of the [[Bessemer process|Bessemer]] steel-making process and the \"[[basic slag]]\" smelting chemistry, which combine to make high-quality steelmaking possible from these unprepossessing ores. The Northampton Sands were a strategic resource for the United Kingdom in the run-up to [[World War II]], being the best-developed bulk iron-producing processes wholly free from dependence on imported materials. However, because the Northampton Sands share in the regional [[dip slope|dip]] of all the sediments of this part of Britain to the east-south-east, they become increasingly difficult to work as one progresses east across the county.<ref>[http://www.brixworth.demon.co.uk/northgeo.jpg Northants Geology Map] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613170012/http://www.brixworth.demon.co.uk/northgeo.jpg |date=13 June 2011 }}.

This is a marine sand of [[Jurassic]] age ([[Bajocian]] stage), deposited as part of an estuary sequence and overlain by a sequence of limestones and mudrocks. Significant amounts of the sand have been replaced or displaced by iron minerals, giving an average ore grade of around 25 [[Concentration#Mass percentage (fraction)|wt%]] iron. To the west the iron ores have been moderately exploited for a very long time, but their high phosphorus content made them difficult to smelt and produced iron of poor quality until the development of the [[Bessemer process|Bessemer]] steel-making process and the \"[[basic slag]]\" smelting chemistry, which combine to make high-quality steelmaking possible from these unprepossessing ores. The Northampton Sands were a strategic resource for the United Kingdom in the run-up to [[World War II]], being the best-developed bulk iron-producing processes wholly free from dependence on imported materials. However, because the Northampton Sands share in the regional [[dip slope|dip]] of all the sediments of this part of Britain to the east-south-east, they become increasingly difficult to work as one progresses east across the county.<ref>[http://www.brixworth.demon.co.uk/northgeo.jpg Northants Geology Map] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613170012/http://www.brixworth.demon.co.uk/northgeo.jpg |date=13 June 2011 }}.

While the senior Booth was, like his contemporaries [[Edmund Kean]] and [[William Charles Macready]], strong and bombastic, favoring characters such as Richard III, Edwin played more [[Naturalism (art)|naturalistically]], with a quiet, more thoughtful delivery, tailored to roles like Hamlet.\n\n==Later life==\nBooth was married to Mary Devlin from 1860 to 1863, the year of her death. They had one daughter, Edwina, born on December 9, 1861, in [[London]]. He later remarried, wedding his acting partner Mary McVicker in 1869, and became a widower again in 1881.\n[[File:Edwin Booth with daughter Edwina.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Edwin Booth with daughter Edwina, ''circa'' 1864]]\nIn 1869, Edwin acquired his brother John's body after repeatedly writing to President [[Andrew Johnson]] pleading for it.

Goff, p. 70-71</ref> [[Robert Todd Lincoln|Robert]], from serious injury or even death. The incident occurred on a train platform in [[Jersey City]], [[New Jersey]]. The exact date of the incident is uncertain, but it is believed to have taken place in late 1864 or early 1865. Robert Lincoln recalled the incident in a 1909 letter to Richard Watson Gilder, editor of ''The Century Magazine''.\n\n<blockquote>The incident occurred while a group of passengers were late at night purchasing their sleeping car places from the conductor who stood on the station platform at the entrance of the car. The platform was about the height of the car floor, and there was of course a narrow space between the platform and the car body. There was some crowding, and I happened to be pressed by it against the car body while waiting my turn. In this situation the train began to move, and by the motion I was twisted off my feet, and had dropped somewhat, with feet downward, into the open space, and was personally helpless, when my coat collar was vigorously seized and I was quickly pulled up and out to a secure footing on the platform. Upon turning to thank my rescuer I saw it was Edwin Booth, whose face was of course well known to me, and I expressed my gratitude to him, and in doing so, called him by name.</blockquote>\n\nBooth did not know the identity of the man whose life he had saved until some months later, when he received a letter from a friend, Colonel [[Adam Badeau]], who was an officer on the staff of General [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. Badeau had heard the story from Robert Lincoln, who had since joined the Union Army and was also serving on Grant's staff. In the letter, Badeau gave his compliments to Booth for the heroic deed. The fact that he had saved the life of Abraham Lincoln's son was said to have been of some comfort to Edwin Booth following his brother's assassination of the president.\n[[File:Gramercy Park Edwin Booth statue.jpg|thumb|upright|167px|Statue of Booth as ''Hamlet'', [[Gramercy Park]] by [[Edmond Thomas Quinn|Edmond T.

Afterwards, Booth built his own theatre, an elaborate structure called [[Booth's Theatre]] in [[Manhattan]], which opened on February 3, 1869, with a production of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' starring Booth as [[Romeo Montague|Romeo]], and Mary McVicker as [[Juliet Capulet|Juliet]]. Elaborate productions followed, but the theatre never became a profitable or even stable financial venture. The [[panic of 1873]] caused the final [[bankruptcy]] of Booth's Theatre in 1874. After the bankruptcy, Booth went on another worldwide tour, eventually regaining his fortune.\n\n==Death==\nEdwin Booth had a small stroke in 1891, which precipitated his decline. He suffered another stroke in April 1893 and died June 7, 1893, in his apartment in The Players clubhouse. He was buried next to his first wife at [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].

While the senior Booth was, like his contemporaries [[Edmund Kean]] and [[William Charles Macready]], strong and bombastic, favoring characters such as Richard III, Edwin played more [[Naturalism (art)|naturalistically]], with a quiet, more thoughtful delivery, tailored to roles like Hamlet.\n\n==Later life==\nBooth was married to Mary Devlin from 1860 to 1863, the year of her death. They had one daughter, Edwina, born on December 9, 1861, in [[London]].

The exact date of the incident is uncertain, but it is believed to have taken place in late 1864 or early 1865. Robert Lincoln recalled the incident in a 1909 letter to Richard Watson Gilder, editor of ''The Century Magazine''.\n\n<blockquote>The incident occurred while a group of passengers were late at night purchasing their sleeping car places from the conductor who stood on the station platform at the entrance of the car. The platform was about the height of the car floor, and there was of course a narrow space between the platform and the car body. There was some crowding, and I happened to be pressed by it against the car body while waiting my turn. In this situation the train began to move, and by the motion I was twisted off my feet, and had dropped somewhat, with feet downward, into the open space, and was personally helpless, when my coat collar was vigorously seized and I was quickly pulled up and out to a secure footing on the platform. Upon turning to thank my rescuer I saw it was Edwin Booth, whose face was of course well known to me, and I expressed my gratitude to him, and in doing so, called him by name.</blockquote>\n\nBooth did not know the identity of the man whose life he had saved until some months later, when he received a letter from a friend, Colonel [[Adam Badeau]], who was an officer on the staff of General [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. Badeau had heard the story from Robert Lincoln, who had since joined the Union Army and was also serving on Grant's staff. In the letter, Badeau gave his compliments to Booth for the heroic deed. The fact that he had saved the life of Abraham Lincoln's son was said to have been of some comfort to Edwin Booth following his brother's assassination of the president.\n[[File:Gramercy Park Edwin Booth statue.jpg|thumb|upright|167px|Statue of Booth as ''Hamlet'', [[Gramercy Park]] by [[Edmond Thomas Quinn|Edmond T.

Afterwards, Booth built his own theatre, an elaborate structure called [[Booth's Theatre]] in [[Manhattan]], which opened on February 3, 1869, with a production of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' starring Booth as [[Romeo Montague|Romeo]], and Mary McVicker as [[Juliet Capulet|Juliet]]. Elaborate productions followed, but the theatre never became a profitable or even stable financial venture. The [[panic of 1873]] caused the final [[bankruptcy]] of Booth's Theatre in 1874. After the bankruptcy, Booth went on another worldwide tour, eventually regaining his fortune.\n\n==Death==\nEdwin Booth had a small stroke in 1891, which precipitated his decline. He suffered another stroke in April 1893 and died June 7, 1893, in his apartment in The Players clubhouse.

One of the best known is the 1955 film ''[[Prince of Players]]'' written by [[Moss Hart]], based loosely on the popular book of that name by Eleanor Ruggles. It was directed by Philip Dunne and stars [[Richard Burton]] and [[Raymond Massey]] as Edwin and Junius Brutus Booth, Sr., with [[Charles Bickford]] and [[Eva Le Gallienne]], the latter of whom plays Gertrude to Burton's Hamlet. The film depicts events in Booth's life well before, and then surrounding, the assassination of Lincoln by Booth's younger brother.<ref>Charles H.

In that movie, the character of Granville Thorndyke (as acted by [[Alan Mowbray]]) is an obvious nod to Booth's father [[Junius Brutus Booth|Junius]], and the scenes portray essentially the same sequence where the great actor has to be retrieved from a bar and dragged back to the theatre where he is overdue to give a performance in front of a restless audience.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.shakespearegeek.com/2010/08/edwin-booth-prince-of-players.html|title=Edwin Booth : Prince of Players {{!}} Shakespeare Geek, The Original Shakespeare Blog|date=2010-08-02|work=Shakespeare Geek, The Original Shakespeare Blog|access-date=2017-03-07|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Milton Pereira|title=My Darling Clementine - Shakespeare Scene|date=2007-07-25|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UrcR_01-bM|accessdate=2017-03-07}}</ref>\n\n''The Brothers BOOTH!'', by W.

Developed by Big Ape Productions and published by [[Activision]] ([[Electronic Arts]] in Europe) for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], it was first released in Europe in March 2001, followed by North America a month later. It is also the only Simpsons video game released for the PlayStation\n\nThere are 20 characters in the game, all of whom are voiced by the same actors that provide their voices in the show, and each character executes his or her own exclusive moves and gestures and power moves in the [[wrestling ring]]. The matches take place in detailed [[3D computer graphics|3D]] locations from [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. A round in the game ends when one wrestler [[pin (professional wrestling)|pins]] his opponent for a three count. Two victorious rounds wins a match. Unlike in traditional wrestling rules, the opponent may be pinned belly-down.\n\nThe game was widely panned by critics, and is considered to be one of the [[List of video games notable for negative reception|worst video games of all time]].\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe game is loosely based on professional wrestling games, but more closely resembles a beat-'em up. The game can be played in two modes: a tournament style single-player game or a grudge match where two players can interact. The matches take place in ten different detailed 3D locations from [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]], such as the [[742 Evergreen Terrace|Simpsons' house]], the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]], the [[Kwik-E-Mart]], and [[Moe's Tavern]].<ref name=\"BBC\"/> Letters float around in the wrestling ring, and if a wrestler collects enough of them, they can [[taunt]] and temporarily become invincible.<ref name=\"gspot\"/> A round ends when one wrestler [[pin (professional wrestling)|pins]] their opponent for a three count. Two rounds are needed to win a match.<ref name=\"reiner\"/>\n\nEach time a successful attack is performed on a player, their health meter depletes. Players with low health stay stunned for longer when knocked down. A player can increase their health by picking up food items that randomly appear in the ring. Running and attacks drain stamina. If a player does not have enough stamina to perform a certain move, it becomes unavailable until they recover. Stamina is regained through not pressing the actions buttons or picking up certain items. Attacks which require more stamina are generally more effective. The stun meter only appears when the opponent is knocked down. It depletes gradually, but the stunned player cannot move until the Stun meter is completely drained. A player can reduce the stun meter faster by pressing the action buttons, or by receiving certain attacks. If a player is low on health, the stun meter will normally be higher, making pin attempts harder to resist. Once a player's health is completely depleted, it will only take one hit to stun them.

If either player collects enough to spell the word \"TAUNT\", they can then perform a taunt. The taunt will completely drain the opponent's stamina, making them unable to attack for a limited time.\n\n==Characters==\nThe game features 20 characters from the show, all of whom are voiced by the same actors that provide their voices in ''The Simpsons''. The player begins with only 8 of the 12 main characters to begin with. Others can be made playable by unlocking them, or unlocking a certain game mode.\n\n*[[Homer Simpson|Homer]] - Homer is the most balanced character in the game, but relies particularly on brawling.\n*[[Bart Simpson|Bart]] - Bart is a faster character who uses toys (skateboard, catapult) to make up for his lack of strength.\n*[[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] - Lisa is another smaller character who uses her speed to make quick strikes on opponents. Her saxophone attack can hit an opponent anywhere within the ring.\n*[[Marge Simpson|Marge]] - Marge has good reach but lacks strength. She uses household items as weapons. She can even use [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] to limit an opponent's movement.\n*[[Barney Gumble|Barney]] - Barney is one of the stronger characters, but lacks speed and stamina. His attacks are based on beer (including throwing beer glasses).\n*[[Krusty the Clown|Krusty]] - Krusty is a balanced character who uses a combination of brawling and typical clown paraphernalia.\n*[[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon|Apu]] - Apu is a brawler with moderate strength, but has good speed and stamina.\n*[[Groundskeeper Willie]] - Willie uses gardening equipment to either keep opponents at a distance or to limit their movement.\n*[[List of celebrities in The Simpsons#Bumblebee Man|Bumblebee Man]] - (Unlockable) Bumblebee Man is a balanced brawler.\n*[[Moe Szyslak|Moe]] - (Unlockable) Moe is one of the faster characters who relies on fighting dirty. To that end, he carries a lot of makeshift weapons.\n*[[Ned Flanders]] - (Unlockable) Ned Flanders is a weak character with very strong special attacks. His prayer attack is the most damaging in the game as it causes high damage, stuns instantly and hits repeatedly anywhere in the ring. He also fully recovers when pinned, so opponents must beat him twice just to win one singular round.\n*[[Professor Frink]] - (Unlockable) Frink is a hard to control character who relies on gadgets to wear down opponents.\n*[[Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns]] - (Boss Character) [[Waylon Smithers]] fights on Mr. Burn's behalf while Burns stands outside of the ring. Their strongest attack involves Mr. Burns throwing explosives into the ring that do not affect Smithers. They are only playable in the Mr. Burn's Office level.\n*[[Kang and Kodos]] - (Boss Character) Kang battles on behalf of this team while Kodos supports by throwing random items into the ring. They are only available in the Spaceship level.\n*[[The Itchy & Scratchy Show|Itchy]] - Itchy is a cartoon mouse with a lot of dangerous booby traps and weapons. He is only available in his own stage and can only battle Scratchy.\n*[[The Itchy & Scratchy Show|Scratchy]] - Scratchy is the long-suffering victim of Itchy. However, his moves and attributes are comparable to Itchy's. He is only available in his own stage and can only battle Itchy.\n\nThe voice of [[Kent Brockman]] can be heard occasionally during matches as a commentator.

Developed by Big Ape Productions and published by [[Activision]] ([[Electronic Arts]] in Europe) for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], it was first released in Europe in March 2001, followed by North America a month later. It is also the only Simpsons video game released for the PlayStation\n\nThere are 20 characters in the game, all of whom are voiced by the same actors that provide their voices in the show, and each character executes his or her own exclusive moves and gestures and power moves in the [[wrestling ring]]. The matches take place in detailed [[3D computer graphics|3D]] locations from [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. A round in the game ends when one wrestler [[pin (professional wrestling)|pins]] his opponent for a three count. Two victorious rounds wins a match. Unlike in traditional wrestling rules, the opponent may be pinned belly-down.\n\nThe game was widely panned by critics, and is considered to be one of the [[List of video games notable for negative reception|worst video games of all time]].\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe game is loosely based on professional wrestling games, but more closely resembles a beat-'em up. The game can be played in two modes: a tournament style single-player game or a grudge match where two players can interact. The matches take place in ten different detailed 3D locations from [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]], such as the [[742 Evergreen Terrace|Simpsons' house]], the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]], the [[Kwik-E-Mart]], and [[Moe's Tavern]].<ref name=\"BBC\"/> Letters float around in the wrestling ring, and if a wrestler collects enough of them, they can [[taunt]] and temporarily become invincible.<ref name=\"gspot\"/> A round ends when one wrestler [[pin (professional wrestling)|pins]] their opponent for a three count. Two rounds are needed to win a match.<ref name=\"reiner\"/>\n\nEach time a successful attack is performed on a player, their health meter depletes. Players with low health stay stunned for longer when knocked down. A player can increase their health by picking up food items that randomly appear in the ring. Running and attacks drain stamina. If a player does not have enough stamina to perform a certain move, it becomes unavailable until they recover. Stamina is regained through not pressing the actions buttons or picking up certain items. Attacks which require more stamina are generally more effective. The stun meter only appears when the opponent is knocked down. It depletes gradually, but the stunned player cannot move until the Stun meter is completely drained. A player can reduce the stun meter faster by pressing the action buttons, or by receiving certain attacks. If a player is low on health, the stun meter will normally be higher, making pin attempts harder to resist. Once a player's health is completely depleted, it will only take one hit to stun them. Certain attacks to a stunned opponent will actually reset the stun meter.\n\n[[File:Thesimpsonswrestlinggameplay.png|thumb|200px|left|Homer and Bart fight in the wrestling ring.

Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism...Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her.
