Business jets may be adapted for other roles, such as the evacuation of casualties or express parcel deliveries, and some are used by public bodies, [[government official]]s or the [[armed forces]].\n\n== History ==\n===Early developments===\nThe first jet-powered civil aircraft was the [[Morane-Saulnier MS.760 Paris]], developed privately in the early 1950s from the [[Morane-Saulnier MS.755 Fleuret|MS.755 Fleuret]] two-seat [[jet trainer]]. First flown in 1954, the MS.760 Paris differs from subsequent business jets in having only four seats arranged in two rows without a center aisle, an arrangement similar to a [[light aircraft]], under a large sliding [[canopy (aircraft)|canopy]] similar to that of a [[fighter aircraft|fighter]]. A U.S. [[type certificate]] was awarded in July 1958, but commercial sales were limited, with most examples going to the military; an improved civil version similar to a modern [[very light jet]], with a 6-seat enclosed cabin and a conventional door, never proceeded past the prototype stage.<ref name=GA_2010>{{cite magazine |last=Jerram |first=Mike |date=October 2010 |title=Morane-Saulnier Paris: the very first Very Light Jet |url=http://www.iaopa.eu/mediaServlet/storage/gamag/oct10/p42-45.pdf |magazine=General Aviation |publisher=international Council of Aircraft Owners and Pilots Associations |access-date=17 April 2020 }}</ref> The commercial failure of the MS.760 Paris prompted the cancellation of projects by [[Cessna]] and [[Douglas Aircraft]] to market similar jets.<ref name=Flying1987/>\n\nThe development of center-aisle cabin business jets was accelerated by an August 1956 [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) letter of requirement for two \"off-the-shelf\" aircraft: the larger UCX (cargo) and smaller UTX (trainer). These requirements differed from standard Air Force procurement contracts in that there would be no formal competitions, and manufacturers were expected to develop the aircraft without government funds; despite this, a substantial USAF purchase would offset the large investment necessary to develop prototypes. The [[Lockheed Corporation]] and [[McDonnell Aircraft]] both began development of UCX aircraft, while [[North American Aviation]] pursued the UTX requirement.<ref name=Flying1987>{{cite news |last=Peter |first=Garrison |title=BABY BIZJET BOOM: The birth of the light jet. |work=[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]] |date=September 1987 |pages=124\u2013126 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Off-The-Shelf Jets |work=[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]] |date=May 1959 |pages=26\u201327, 79 }}</ref>\n\n=== 1950s first flight ===\nThe [[Morane-Saulnier MS.760 Paris]] had a [[aircraft gross weight|gross weight]] of {{convert|7650|lb|t}}, initially powered by two [[Turbom\u00e9ca Marbor\u00e9]] [[turbojet]]s of {{convert|880|lbf|kN}} thrust, although most aircraft were later upgraded to {{convert|1058|lbf|kN}} units.

The {{convert|16,100|lb|t}} MTOW jet was powered by two {{convert|2,900|lbf|kN}} [[JT15D]]. The design was later sold and was renamed Beechjet 400 then [[Hawker 400]], with a total of 950 produced of all variants.\n\n=== 1980s first flight ===\n\nThe 1980s only saw the introduction of derivatives and no major new designs. Also there was an advent of fractional ownership in the late 1980s for business jets.<ref>{{cite web |title=Business jet travel for the masses could come from Uber-like concept. |url=https://www.kansas.com/news/business/aviation/article120969743.html |website=Wichita Eagle |publisher=Wichita Eagle |accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== 1990s first flight ===\n\nThe first flight of the clean-sheet [[Learjet 45]] was on 7 October 1995. All of the 642 aircraft built since then have been powered by two {{convert|3,500|lbf|kN}} TFE731 engines.\n\nPowered by two {{convert|2,300|lbf|kN}} [[Williams FJ44]]s, the {{convert|12,500|lb|t}} [[Beechcraft Premier I]] light jet made its first flight on 22 December 1998. Nearly 300 had been made before production stopped in 2013.\n\n=== 2000s first flight ===\n\nIn the opposite way compared to Bombardier, which developed airliners from a business jet, Embraer derived the [[Legacy 600]] from the [[Embraer ERJ family]] of regional jet airliners. Powered by two {{convert|39.2|kN|lbf|order=flip}} [[Rolls-Royce AE 3007]]s, the first flight of the {{convert|22.5|t|lb|order=flip}} aircraft was on 31 March 2001.\n\nOn 14 August 2001, the [[Bombardier Challenger 300]] made its first flight. The {{convert|38,850|lb|t}} aircraft is powered by two {{convert|6,825|lbf|kN}} [[HTF7000]]s. The 500th example was delivered in 2015.\n\nThe first very light jet, the {{convert|5,950|lb|t}} MTOW [[Eclipse 500]], took off for the first time on 26 August 2002, powered by two {{convert|900|lbf|kN}} [[Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600]]s. Between then and the end of production in 2008, 260 were produced.\n\nIt was followed by the {{convert|8645|lb|t}} MTOW [[Cessna Citation Mustang]] on 23 April 2005, powered by two {{convert|1460|lbf|kN}} Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600s and with more than 450 produced.\n\nThen the [[Embraer Phenom 100]] made its maiden flight on 26 July 2007. The {{convert|4.75|t|lb|order=flip}} MTOW airplane is powered by two {{convert|7.2|kN|lbf|order=flip}} Pratt & Whitney Canada PW600s. With its [[Phenom 300]] development, nearly 600 have been built.\n\n=== 2010s first flight ===\n\nThe first flight of the midsize, [[fly-by-wire]], {{cvt|7,000|lbf|kN}} [[Honeywell HTF7000]]-powered [[Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600|Embraer Legacy 500]] was on 27 November 2012.

[[Ford Motor Company]], [[Chrysler]], and [[Altria]] are examples of companies that own, maintain and operate their own fleet of private aircraft for their employees. Flight departments handle all aspects of aircraft operation and maintenance. In the United States, flight-department aircraft operate under [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Organization|FAR 91]] operating rules.\n\nA 2010 study by the United States [[National Business Aviation Association]] found that small and midsize companies that use private jets produce a 219% higher earnings growth rate than those that strictly use airlines.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.nbaa.org/business-aviation/NEXA-Report-Part-2-2010.pdf |title= Business aviation : an enterprise value perspective |publisher= [[National Business Aviation Association]] |date= Fall 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Charter companies===\nCharter operators own or manage private jets for multiple clients. Like traditional flight departments, charter companies handle all aspects of aircraft operation and maintenance. However, they are not aligned with just one corporation. They manage aircraft for a private owner or corporation and also handle the sales of available flight time on the aircraft they own or manage. Maintenance services can also be provided.\n\nIn the United States, business aircraft may be operated under either FAR 91 as private operations for the business purposes of the owner, or under [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Organization|FAR 135]] of the Federal Aviation Regulations as commercial operations for the business purposes of a third party. One common arrangement for operational flexibility purposes is for the aircraft's owner to operate the aircraft under FAR 91 when needed for its own purposes, and to allow a third-party charter-manager to operate it under FAR 135 when the aircraft is needed for the business purposes of third parties (such as for other entities within the corporate group of the aircraft's owner).<ref>{{cite web|last=Epstein|first=Jonathan M.|title=Placing Your Aircraft With An Aircraft Charter-Management Company|url=http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/266322/Aviation/Placing+Your+Aircraft+with+an+Aircraft&email_access=on|publisher=[[Holland & Knight]]|accessdate=4 October 2013|date=1 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nAircraft charter brokers have entered the marketplace through the ease of setting up a website and business online. Aircraft charter operators are legally responsible for the safe operation of aircraft and charter brokers require no economic authority and are largely unregulated. The [[Department of Transportation]] requires that air charter brokers disclose to the consumer that they do not operate aircraft and cannot use terms like \"our fleet of aircraft\", \"we operate\", \"our charter service\" and others.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE ROLE OF AIR CHARTER BROKERS IN ARRANGING AIR TRANSPORTATION|url=https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/BrokerNoticeFinal%20Guidance.pdf|website=Department of Transportation|publisher=Department of Transportation}}</ref>\n\n===Fractional ownership===\nSince 1996 the term \"fractional jet\" has been used in connection with business aircraft owned by a consortium of companies. Under such arrangements, overhead costs such as [[aircrew member|flight crew]], hangarage and maintenance are split among the users.\n\n[[Fractional ownership of aircraft]] involves an individual or corporation that pays an upfront equity share for the cost of an aircraft. If four parties are involved, a partner would pay one-fourth of the aircraft price (a \"quarter share\"). That partner is now an equity owner in that aircraft and can sell the equity position if necessary.

small groups of people. Business jets may be adapted for other roles, such as the evacuation of casualties or express parcel deliveries, and some are used by public bodies, [[government official]]s or the [[armed forces]].\n\n== History ==\n===Early developments===\nThe first jet-powered civil aircraft was the [[Morane-Saulnier MS.760 Paris]], developed privately in the early 1950s from the [[Morane-Saulnier MS.755 Fleuret|MS.755 Fleuret]] two-seat [[jet trainer]]. First flown in 1954, the MS.760 Paris differs from subsequent business jets in having only four seats arranged in two rows without a center aisle, an arrangement similar to a [[light aircraft]], under a large sliding [[canopy (aircraft)|canopy]] similar to that of a [[fighter aircraft|fighter]]. A U.S. [[type certificate]] was awarded in July 1958, but commercial sales were limited, with most examples going to the military; an improved civil version similar to a modern [[very light jet]], with a 6-seat enclosed cabin and a conventional door, never proceeded past the prototype stage.<ref name=GA_2010>{{cite magazine |last=Jerram |first=Mike |date=October 2010 |title=Morane-Saulnier Paris: the very first Very Light Jet |url=http://www.iaopa.eu/mediaServlet/storage/gamag/oct10/p42-45.pdf |magazine=General Aviation |publisher=international Council of Aircraft Owners and Pilots Associations |access-date=17 April 2020 }}</ref> The commercial failure of the MS.760 Paris prompted the cancellation of projects by [[Cessna]] and [[Douglas Aircraft]] to market similar jets.<ref name=Flying1987/>\n\nThe development of center-aisle cabin business jets was accelerated by an August 1956 [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) letter of requirement for two \"off-the-shelf\" aircraft: the larger UCX (cargo) and smaller UTX (trainer). These requirements differed from standard Air Force procurement contracts in that there would be no formal competitions, and manufacturers were expected to develop the aircraft without government funds; despite this, a substantial USAF purchase would offset the large investment necessary to develop prototypes.

[[Ford Motor Company]], [[Chrysler]], and [[Altria]] are examples of companies that own, maintain and operate their own fleet of private aircraft for their employees. Flight departments handle all aspects of aircraft operation and maintenance. In the United States, flight-department aircraft operate under [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Organization|FAR 91]] operating rules.\n\nA 2010 study by the United States [[National Business Aviation Association]] found that small and midsize companies that use private jets produce a 219% higher earnings growth rate than those that strictly use airlines.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.nbaa.org/business-aviation/NEXA-Report-Part-2-2010.pdf |title= Business aviation : an enterprise value perspective |publisher= [[National Business Aviation Association]] |date= Fall 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Charter companies===\nCharter operators own or manage private jets for multiple clients. Like traditional flight departments, charter companies handle all aspects of aircraft operation and maintenance. However, they are not aligned with just one corporation. They manage aircraft for a private owner or corporation and also handle the sales of available flight time on the aircraft they own or manage. Maintenance services can also be provided.\n\nIn the United States, business aircraft may be operated under either FAR 91 as private operations for the business purposes of the owner, or under [[Federal Aviation Regulations#Organization|FAR 135]] of the Federal Aviation Regulations as commercial operations for the business purposes of a third party. One common arrangement for operational flexibility purposes is for the aircraft's owner to operate the aircraft under FAR 91 when needed for its own purposes, and to allow a third-party charter-manager to operate it under FAR 135 when the aircraft is needed for the business purposes of third parties (such as for other entities within the corporate group of the aircraft's owner).<ref>{{cite web|last=Epstein|first=Jonathan M.|title=Placing Your Aircraft With An Aircraft Charter-Management Company|url=http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/266322/Aviation/Placing+Your+Aircraft+with+an+Aircraft&email_access=on|publisher=[[Holland & Knight]]|accessdate=4 October 2013|date=1 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nAircraft charter brokers have entered the marketplace through the ease of setting up a website and business online. Aircraft charter operators are legally responsible for the safe operation of aircraft and charter brokers require no economic authority and are largely unregulated. The [[Department of Transportation]] requires that air charter brokers disclose to the consumer that they do not operate aircraft and cannot use terms like \"our fleet of aircraft\", \"we operate\", \"our charter service\" and others.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE ROLE OF AIR CHARTER BROKERS IN ARRANGING AIR TRANSPORTATION|url=https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/BrokerNoticeFinal%20Guidance.pdf|website=Department of Transportation|publisher=Department of Transportation}}</ref>\n\n===Fractional ownership===\nSince 1996 the term \"fractional jet\" has been used in connection with business aircraft owned by a consortium of companies. Under such arrangements, overhead costs such as [[aircrew member|flight crew]], hangarage and maintenance are split among the users.\n\n[[Fractional ownership of aircraft]] involves an individual or corporation that pays an upfront equity share for the cost of an aircraft. If four parties are involved, a partner would pay one-fourth of the aircraft price (a \"quarter share\"). That partner is now an equity owner in that aircraft and can sell the equity position if necessary. This also entitles the new owner to a certain number of hours of flight time on that aircraft, or any comparable aircraft in the fleet. Additional fees include monthly management fees and incidentals such as catering and ground transportation. In the United States, fractional-ownership operations may be regulated by either FAA [[Part 91 operator|part 91 or part 135]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Rules of the Game |url=https://www.bjtonline.com/business-jet-news/the-rules-of-the-game |website=Business Jet Traveler |publisher=Business Jet Traveler |accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Surveillance ===\n\nWith smaller equipment, long-range business aircraft can be modified as [[surveillance aircraft]] to perform specialized missions cost-effectively, from ground surveillance to maritime patrol:<ref>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/business-aviation/spotlight-bizjet-based-special-mission-aircraft |title= Spotlight on Bizjet-based Special Mission Aircraft |date= 10 January 2018 |author= Graham Warwick |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>\n* the {{cvt|99,500|lb}}, 6,000 nmi [[Bombardier Global 6000]] is the platform for the USAF [[Northrop Grumman E-11]]A Battlefield Airborne Communications Node, the radar-carrying ground-surveillance [[Raytheon Sentinel]] for the [[UK Royal Air Force]], and Saab's [[Globaleye]] AEW&C carrying its [[Erieye]] AESA radar as UK's [[Marshall ADG]] basis for [[Elint]]/[[Sigint]] for the [[United Arab Emirates]]; it is also the base for the proposed [[Saab AB]] Swordfish MPA and the USAF [[Lockheed Martin]] [[JSTARS#Future|J-Stars Recap]] battlefield-surveillance program, while [[Israel Aerospace Industries|IAI]]'s ELI-3360 [[Maritime patrol aircraft|MPA]] is based on the Global 5000;\n* The {{cvt|91,000|lb}}, 6,750 nmi [[Gulfstream G550]] was selected for the [[IAI EL/W-2085]] Conformal Airborne Early Warning [[AESA radar]] for Italy, Singapore and Israel (which also has IAI Sigint G550s) while [[L3 Technologies]] transfers the U.S. [[Compass Call]] electronic-attack system to the G550 CAEW-based EC-37B, like the NC-37B range-support aircraft, and will modify others for Australia's {{abbr|AISREW|Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Electronic Warfare}} program, [[Northrop Grumman]] proposes the G550 for the J-Stars Recap;\n* Dassault Aviation developed the Falcon 900 MPA and Falcon 2000 Maritime Multirole Aircraft for France (which delayed its Avsimar requirement), South Korea and the [[Japan Coast Guard]] with a mission system developed with L3 and [[Thales Group]];\n* Embraer delivered several EMB-145s as a platform for [[AEW&C]], MPA and multi-[[Military intelligence|intelligence]];\n\n==Classes==\nBusiness jets can be categorized according to their size.\n\n===Very light jets===\n{{main|Very light jet}}\n[[File:N816CW Cessna Citation Mustang (7534559132).jpg|thumb|The most-sold VLJ is the [[Cessna Citation Mustang]].]]\n\nThe [[very light jet]] (VLJ) is a classification initiated by the release of the [[Eclipse 500]],<ref name=JA/><ref name=AC/><ref name=FMvlj/> on 31 December 2006, which was originally available at around US$1.5 million, cheaper than existing business jets and comparable with turboprop aircraft.

Mikovits led a research effort that reported in 2009 that a [[retrovirus]] known as [[xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus]] (XMRV) was associated with CFS and may have had a causal role, however the research came under fire, leading to an eventual retraction on December 22, 2011 by the journal Science.\n\nIn October 2011, Mikovits was terminated by WPI for refusing to turn over a cell line that was delivered to her laboratory by mistake, and subsequently came under investigation for alleged manipulation of data in her publications related to XMRV.<ref>{{cite news | title = Manipulation alleged in paper linking virus, chronic fatigue syndrome | url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/health/chi-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-paper-10032011,0,6792877.story | newspaper = [[Chicago Tribune]] | date = October 3, 2011}}</ref> On November 18, 2011, Judy Mikovits was arrested in her Ventura County, California home.

In 1986 - 1987, she started working at [[Upjohn Pharmaceuticals]] in [[Kalamazoo Michigan]] in order to develop production methods to ensure biological materials manufactured using human blood products were free of contamination from [[HIV-1]].

Mikovits led a research effort that reported in 2009 that a [[retrovirus]] known as [[xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus]] (XMRV) was associated with CFS and may have had a causal role, however the research came under fire, leading to an eventual retraction on December 22, 2011 by the journal Science.\n\nIn October 2011, Mikovits was terminated by WPI for refusing to turn over a cell line that was delivered to her laboratory by mistake, and subsequently came under investigation for alleged manipulation of data in her publications related to XMRV.<ref>{{cite news | title = Manipulation alleged in paper linking virus, chronic fatigue syndrome | url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/health/chi-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-paper-10032011,0,6792877.story | newspaper = [[Chicago Tribune]] | date = October 3, 2011}}</ref> On November 18, 2011, Judy Mikovits was arrested in her Ventura County, California home.

In 1986 - 1987, she started working at [[Upjohn Pharmaceuticals]] in [[Kalamazoo Michigan]] in order to develop production methods to ensure biological materials manufactured using human blood products were free of contamination from [[HIV-1]]. In 1992 she completed a joint PhD program in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at [[George Washington University]].<ref name=\"Judy A.
