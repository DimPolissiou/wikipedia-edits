The version in his home town was originally completed in 1771.\n\n==Description==\nJoseph Wright of Derby painted five paintings on the theme of a blacksmith's shop or a forge between the years 1771 and 1773. The Derby Museum version is of a blacksmith's shop where three men work to manufacture an iron or steel component. The presence of visitors and the nocturnal work is explained by the farrier working outside. Wright has imagined that a traveller has broken down on a journey and the farrier is therefore working by the light of a candle.<ref name=\"NicolsonArt1968\">{{cite book|author1=Benedict Nicolson|author2=Paul Mellon Foundation for British Art|title=Joseph Wright of Derby: painter of light|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ms09AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA51|accessdate=13 May 2011|year=1968|publisher=Paul Mellon Foundation for British Art; Routledge and K.

The man appears too old to work but offers gravitas to those that are.<ref name=\"NicolsonArt1968\"/>\nInvestigations of one of Wright's blacksmith's paintings has revealed the lengths that Wright went to achieve his image. Beneath the image of the ingot and hidden by layers of both yellow and white investigaters found a small piece of gold leaf that Wright had placed there two centuries before. The gold is not thought to have added to the painting, but Wright obviously thought it might in some way.<ref name=solkin>{{cite journal|last=Solkin|first=David H.|title=Joseph Wright of Derby and the Sublime Art of Labour|journal=Representations|volume=83|issue=1|pages=167\u2013194|year=2003|jstor=10.1525/rep.2003.83.1.167|doi=10.1525/rep.2003.83.1.167}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\nLater versions which involve a forge rather than a blacksmith's more traditional way of working are now in the [[Hermitage Museum]] in St Petersburg and in [[The Tate]] in London. In these the main figure is working with a power forge whilst he is observed by his family. The nocturnal nature of Wright's \"night pieces\" was different to his contemporaries. The real novelty was however in the subject matter. Water powered forges were not new, but Wright was being innovative in proposing that these scenes could be the subject of a fine artist. For this reason Wrights paintings are frequently used as a symbol of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and [[The Enlightenment]]. Wright was an important figure in relation to the [[Lunar Society]] and [[Derby Philosophical Society]] whose members were shaping the development of Science and Engineering in England.<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&workid=20593&searchid=9916&roomid=false&tabview=text&texttype=10 Joseph Wright of Derby], Diane Perkins, The Tate. Retrieved 13 May 2011</ref>\nIn 1772, Wright created a 44 by 52-inch variation on this theme called ''The Iron Forge'' which was sold to [[Lord Palmerston]] for 200 pounds. This version is still in the Palmerstone family. Another 41 by 55-inch version titled ''An Iron Forge viewed from without'' was sold to ''[[Empress Catherine of Russia]].'' Catherine the great later bought two other Wright paintings; one was of fireworks and another was from his Vesuvius paintings, however the painting of the forge was considered the best of the three.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070315082401/http://www.search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk/content/files/81/76/355.rtf Joseph Wright of Derby: Art, the Enlightenment and Industrial], RevolutionaryPlayers. Retrieved May 2011</ref>\n\nAnother 1771 version was titled ''The Blacksmith's Shop'' and this sold to the 1st [[Lord Melbourne]]. It remained in the Melbourne family until it was purchased and given to Down House where it joined the collection in memory of [[Charles Darwin]]. This version is now in the Mellon collection.\n\n''An Iron Forge'' develops the idea of blacksmith's shop which is a craft that has changed little on hundreds of years. Forges seen in the 1772 pension show the addition of [[trip hammer|water powered hammers]] that allow the forger to stand proud before his family. The painting is in the Tate. A similar painting of a forge but viewed from outside is in the ''Hermitage Museum.''<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=-1&workid=20593&searchid=20920&roomid=false&tabview=text&texttype=10 An Iron Forge 1772], The Tate. Retrieved July 2011</ref>\n\n==Provenance==\nThe 1771 painting was bought by the ArtFund and [[Derby Museum and Art Gallery]] in 1979 for approximately 69,000 pounds from the Greg family who had owned it since 1875.<ref>[http://www.artfund.org/artwork/4311/the-blacksmith%27s-shop The Blacksmith's Shop], artfund.org.

The version in his home town was originally completed in 1771.\n\n==Description==\nJoseph Wright of Derby painted five paintings on the theme of a blacksmith's shop or a forge between the years 1771 and 1773. The Derby Museum version is of a blacksmith's shop where three men work to manufacture an iron or steel component. The presence of visitors and the nocturnal work is explained by the farrier working outside. Wright has imagined that a traveller has broken down on a journey and the farrier is therefore working by the light of a candle.<ref name=\"NicolsonArt1968\">{{cite book|author1=Benedict Nicolson|author2=Paul Mellon Foundation for British Art|title=Joseph Wright of Derby: painter of light|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ms09AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA51|accessdate=13 May 2011|year=1968|publisher=Paul Mellon Foundation for British Art; Routledge and K.

The man appears too old to work but offers gravitas to those that are.<ref name=\"NicolsonArt1968\"/>\nInvestigations of one of Wright's blacksmith's paintings has revealed the lengths that Wright went to achieve his image. Beneath the image of the ingot and hidden by layers of both yellow and white investigaters found a small piece of gold leaf that Wright had placed there two centuries before. The gold is not thought to have added to the painting, but Wright obviously thought it might in some way.<ref name=solkin>{{cite journal|last=Solkin|first=David H.|title=Joseph Wright of Derby and the Sublime Art of Labour|journal=Representations|volume=83|issue=1|pages=167\u2013194|year=2003|jstor=10.1525/rep.2003.83.1.167|doi=10.1525/rep.2003.83.1.167}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\nLater versions which involve a forge rather than a blacksmith's more traditional way of working are now in the [[Hermitage Museum]] in St Petersburg and in [[The Tate]] in London. In these the main figure is working with a power forge whilst he is observed by his family. The nocturnal nature of Wright's \"night pieces\" was different to his contemporaries. The real novelty was however in the subject matter. Water powered forges were not new, but Wright was being innovative in proposing that these scenes could be the subject of a fine artist. For this reason Wrights paintings are frequently used as a symbol of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and [[The Enlightenment]]. Wright was an important figure in relation to the [[Lunar Society]] and [[Derby Philosophical Society]] whose members were shaping the development of Science and Engineering in England.<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&workid=20593&searchid=9916&roomid=false&tabview=text&texttype=10 Joseph Wright of Derby], Diane Perkins, The Tate.

This version is still in the Parmerstone family. Another 41 by 55-inch version titled ''An Iron Forge viewed from without'' was sold to ''[[Empress Catherine of Russia]].'' Catherine the great later bought two other Wright paintings; one was of fireworks and another was from his Vesuvius paintings, however the painting of the forge was considered the best of the three.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070315082401/http://www.search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk/content/files/81/76/355.rtf Joseph Wright of Derby: Art, the Enlightenment and Industrial], RevolutionaryPlayers.

It remained in the Melbourne family until it was purchased and given to Down House where it joined the collection in memory of [[Charles Darwin]]. This version is now in the Mellon collection.\n\n''An Iron Forge'' develops the idea of blacksmith's shop which is a craft that has changed little on hundreds of years. Forges seen in the 1772 pension show the addition of [[trip hammer|water powered hammers]] that allow the forger to stand proud before his family. The painting is in the Tate. A similar painting of a forge but viewed from outside is in the ''Hermitage Museum.''<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=-1&workid=20593&searchid=20920&roomid=false&tabview=text&texttype=10 An Iron Forge 1772], The Tate.

The army placed cannons there to repel a British invasion against their stake in Boston. Washington was confident the army could resist a small-scale invasion with their fortifications.

The army placed cannons there to repel a British invasion against their stake in Boston. Washington was confident the army could resist a small-scale invasion with their fortifications.

It's Me, Jesus'''\" is the sixteenth and penultimate episode of the [[South Park (season 3)|third season]] of the animated television series ''[[South Park]]''. It was originally broadcast on December 29, 1999. The episode's title and the theme of menstruation was inspired by the book ''[[Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.]]''\n\n==Plot synopsis==\nAs the year 2000 is approaching, [[Cartman]] realizes [[blood]] is coming out of his [[anus]], leading him to believe he is experiencing his first [[menstrual cycle|period]] and thus commencing [[puberty]]. He makes fun of the other boys for not hitting puberty yet, unaware that his bleeding is caused by a minor [[stomach]] infection that has spread across South Park, and that it can be cured with antibiotics. [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] later contracts the same ailment, and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]], not wanting to be left out, pretends he is also afflicted. The boys consequently abandon [[Stan Marsh|Stan]] and leave him out of their next mission, believing he is less mature for not having had his period.\n\nMeanwhile, the people of the world flock around [[Jesus (South Park)|Jesus']] house, excited about the new millennium and saying that, at the year 2000, Jesus' father should make an appearance. Jesus contacts his father and tells him about his potential resurgence in popularity, but [[List of minor characters on South Park#God|God]] (unseen in their conversation) refuses to show up because mankind is not ready. Jesus, wanting to still satisfy the people, books [[Rod Stewart]] to play a [[New Year's Eve]] concert in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]; everybody decides to go, because a rumor persists that God will show up.\n\nStan, meanwhile, prays for his period, but doesn't get it, so he visits [[List of recurring South Park characters#Dr. Alphonse Mephesto and Kevin|Dr. Mephesto]] and gets a bottle of [[hormone]] pills. Using them causes Stan to grow a beard, have a deeper voice, and develop a pair of [[breast]]s, but still no \"period.\" Afterwards, Kenny suddenly bursts from inside out and dies. At the hospital, they discover the reason: Kenny had shoved a [[tampon]] up his rectum. The doctor expresses concern that \"the children are all shoving tampons up their ass because they've seen the [[Backstreet Boys]] doing it on TV or something.\"\n\nThe crowd in Las Vegas for the [[Hogmanay|New Year's]] concert is enraged upon seeing Rod Stewart (portrayed here as very old and [[urinary incontinence|incontinent]]) and they turn against Jesus. With them preparing to [[crucifixion|crucify]] him again, Stan asks Jesus why God does not answer his prayers, and Jesus explains that, if God does everything for you, then your existence has no real purpose. Jesus realizes that this was God's message: Jesus had to figure his ''own'' way to get people to follow him. And just as he realizes this, God arrives.\n\nAfter the crowd's initial shock over God's appearance (distinctly unlike [[Conceptions of God|traditional depictions of God]]), God offers the people the chance to ask one question. The crowd plans to ask the [[meaning of life]] or [[existence]], but before anyone else can ask, Stan comes up and asks why he hasn't gotten his period. God explains that boys don't get periods, and tells the truth: that Cartman and Kenny are affected by the colon infection and Kyle was lying to fit in with them. God explains to Stan that he will never get a period (because he is male), but he will hit puberty when the time is right. He then returns to [[Heaven]], saying he will answer another question in the year 4000. Stan is satisfied by this, and joyfully starts singing \"[[Auld Lang Syne]]\", but the angry crowd attacks him for wasting their chance to ask God a profoundly important question, as the credits roll.\n\n==Production notes==\nIn the DVD commentary for the episode, Trey Parker and Matt Stone said that [[Comedy Central]] wanted them to produce this episode for the new millennium as every other show was producing Y2K episodes, despite that the season had ended with the prior episode [[Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics]]. Initially, Trey Parker intended for God to look like somewhat a mixture of a [[cat]] and a [[hippopotamus|hippo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/behind/interviews.php?interview=27|title=An interview with Adrien Beard}}South Park Studios; accessed February 16, 2009.</ref>\n\nThis was the first episode to feature [[Eliza Schneider]] and [[Mona Marshall]] providing the voices for the female characters following [[Mary Kay Bergman]]'s death.
