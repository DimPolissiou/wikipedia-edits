RES4's design used lots of windows and sliding glass doors for daylighting and views, and a roof deck includes an outdoor fireplace. Materials such as cedar siding, bamboo flooring, and aluminum-clad windows demonstrated the potential for customization with [[Prefabrication|prefabricated construction]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCarolina Building Solutions (CBS) was the factory selected to build the Dwell Home. Resolution: 4 Architecture's plan for the Dwell Home was designed within the limitations of the highway department regulations for shipping, but CBS still spent several months on engineering the Dwell Home, working within CBS's manufacturing procedures without changing RES4's original design. CBS began constructing the modules on April 6, 2004 and finished on April 13, 2004. It took only five days to build the framing and install insulation, sheathing, rough plumbing, rough electrical, nearly all of the Sheetrock, windows and trim, weatherproofing, cabinetry and stairs.

In the playoffs, the Cowboys disposed of the [[1992 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]], followed by a memorable victory against the [[1992 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] en route to a [[Super Bowl XXVII]] win over the [[1992 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]].\n\n==Offseason==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Additions || Subtractions\n|-\n|C [[Frank Cornish]] (Chargers) || TE [[Rob Awalt]] (Broncos)\n|-\n|S [[Thomas Everett]] (Steelers) || LB [[Jack Del Rio]] (Vikings)\n|-\n|DE [[Charles Haley]] (49ers) || K [[Ken Wills]] (Buccaneers)\n|}\n\n===NFL Draft===\n{{main article|1992 NFL draft}}\n\n{{NFL team draft start\n| year      = 1992\n| teamname  = Dallas Cowboys\n}}\n{{NFL team draft entry\n | round      = 1\n | pick       = 17\n | player     = [[Kevin Smith (cornerback)|Kevin Smith]]\n | position   = [[Cornerback|CB]]\n | college    = [[Texas A&M Aggies football|Texas A&M]]\n | notes      = \n | maderoster = yes\n | hof        = \n | probowl    =yes \n}}\n{{NFL team draft entry\n | round      = 1\n | pick       = 24\n | player     = [[Robert Jones (American football)|Robert Jones]]\n | position   = [[Linebacker|LB]]\n | college    = [[East Carolina Pirates football|East Carolina]]\n | notes      = \n | maderoster = yes\n | hof        = \n | probowl    = yes\n}}\n{{NFL team draft entry\n | round      = 2\n | pick       = 36\n | player     = [[Jimmy Smith (wide receiver)|Jimmy Smith]]\n | position   = [[Wide Receiver|WR]]\n | college    = [[Jackson State Tigers football|Jackson State]]\n | notes      = \n | maderoster = yes\n | hof        = \n | probowl    = yes\n}}\n{{NFL team draft entry\n | round      = 2\n | pick       = 37\n | player     = [[Darren Woodson]]\n | position   = [[Safety (gridiron football position)|S]]\n | college    = [[Arizona State Sun Devils football|Arizona State]]\n | notes      = \n | maderoster = yes\n | hof        = \n | probowl    = yes\n}}\n{{NFL team draft end}}\n\n==Regular season==\nThe season would start off with two crucial wins against the [[Washington Redskins]] and the [[New York Giants]], both victors of the previous two Super Bowls.  A ferocious Dallas defense, with not a single player nominated to the Pro Bowl, placed first in the NFL in total defense.  Running back Emmitt Smith would also collect his second straight NFL rushing title.    \nThe 1992 season would also see a renewed rivalry between the [[Dallas Cowboys|Cowboys]] and the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship game set over a decade after the famous play known as [[The Catch (American football)|The Catch]].  This ultimately started the rise of the 49ers and fall of the Cowboys throughout the 1980s.   The rise of the 1990s Cowboys was christened with a 30\u201320 victory against San Francisco at Candlestick Park.  Both franchises would later meet again in the next two [[National Football Conference|NFC]] Championship games in what many consider to be a classic series of contest of future Hall of Fame players.\n\nAt the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]], site of Super Bowl XXVII, the Cowboys would struggle early, finding themselves down 0\u20137, but later regroup when Aikman's pass to tight end [[Jay Novacek]] tied the game 7\u20137.  From there, Dallas would gain all momentum and rout the [[Buffalo Bills]] 52\u201317, forcing a record 9 turnovers and knocking [[Buffalo Bills|Bills]] [[quarterback]] [[Jim Kelly]] out of the game.  [[Troy Aikman]] would earn [[Super Bowl MVP]] honors after completing 22 of 30 passes for 273 yards and 4 touchdowns to wrap up a phenomenal postseason performance.\n\nNotable additions to the team this year included [[defensive end]] [[Charles Haley]], [[cornerback]] [[Kevin Smith (football player)|Kevin Smith]], [[linebacker]] [[Robert Jones (American football)|Robert Jones]], [[Safety (football position)|safety]] [[Thomas Everett]], [[Safety (football position)|safety]] [[Darren Woodson]] and [[wide receiver]] [[Jimmy Smith (wide receiver)|Jimmy Smith]] (though Smith would never catch a pass during his time with the team).\n\nThe Dallas defense (nicknamed \"[[Doomsday II]]\") enjoyed a renaissance, but has never received due credit for its achievements:\n\n* It was only the third defense since [[1980 NFL season|1980]] to hold opponents to fewer than 4,000 yards in a 16-game season. The other defenses to have done it are recognized as two of the greatest of modern era \u2013 the [[1984 Chicago Bears season|1984 Chicago Bears]] and the [[1991 Philadelphia Eagles season|1991 Philadelphia Eagles]].\n* It was the second defense to rank No. 1 in fewest yards yielded without sending a player to the [[Pro Bowl]]. The [[1983 NFL season|1983]] [[Cincinnati Bengals]], who had a losing record were the first.\n* The defense finished first in the [[National Football League|NFL]] in total defense (245.8 yards-per-game), while the secondary finished the year fifth in passing defense (168.1 yards-per-game).\n* It led the [[National Football League|NFL]] in defense against the rush and fewest first downs allowed. Its league lead in preventing third-down conversions was staggering. Dallas's opponents converted 27.2 percent. The [[Seattle Seahawks]] ranked second at 32.6 percent.\n* It set a club record by holding the [[Seattle Seahawks]] to 62 yards in a 27\u20130 victory and closed the season by holding the [[Chicago Bears]] to fewer than 100 yards.\n* [[Super Bowl XXVII]] saw the Cowboys defense at its best, producing a [[Super Bowl]] record 9 turnovers (5 fumbles and 4 interceptions) and even scoring two [[touchdown]]s.\n* Four starters were rookies or second year players ([[Russell Maryland]], [[Robert Jones (American football)|Robert Jones]], [[Larry Brown (cornerback)|Larry Brown]] and [[Kevin Smith (football player)|Kevin Smith]]), and two other joined the team after the preseason ([[Charles Haley]] and [[Thomas Everett]]).\n* This version of the \"[[Doomsday Defense]]\" had tremendous speed and depth.

franchise under head coach [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]] which the Cowboys made one of three Super Bowl appearances between 1992-95.  \n\nHeaded by a powerful offense and the NFL's number one ranked defense, Dallas fielded at the time, the youngest team in the NFL and posted a franchise-best 13\u20133 record throughout the regular season. In the playoffs, the Cowboys disposed of the [[1992 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]], followed by a memorable victory against the [[1992 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] en route to a [[Super Bowl XXVII]] win over the [[1992 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]].\n\n==Offseason==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Additions || Subtractions\n|-\n|C [[Frank Cornish]] (Chargers) || TE [[Rob Awalt]] (Broncos)\n|-\n|S [[Thomas Everett]] (Steelers) || LB [[Jack Del Rio]] (Vikings)\n|-\n|DE [[Charles Haley]] (49ers) || K [[Ken Wills]] (Buccaneers)\n|}\n\n===NFL Draft===\n{{main article|1992 NFL draft}}\n\n{{NFL team draft start\n| year      = 1992\n| teamname  = Dallas Cowboys\n}}\n{{NFL team draft entry\n | round      = 1\n | pick       = 17\n | player     = [[Kevin Smith (cornerback)|Kevin Smith]]\n | position   = [[Cornerback|CB]]\n | college    = [[Texas A&M Aggies football|Texas A&M]]\n | notes      = \n | maderoster = yes\n | hof        = \n | probowl    = \n}}\n{{NFL team draft entry\n | round      = 1\n | pick       = 24\n | player     = [[Robert Jones (American football)|Robert Jones]]\n | position   = [[Linebacker|LB]]\n | college    = [[East Carolina Pirates football|East Carolina]]\n | notes      = \n | maderoster = yes\n | hof        = \n | probowl    = yes\n}}\n{{NFL team draft entry\n | round      = 2\n | pick       = 36\n | player     = [[Jimmy Smith (wide receiver)|Jimmy Smith]]\n | position   = [[Wide Receiver|WR]]\n | college    = [[Jackson State Tigers football|Jackson State]]\n | notes      = \n | maderoster = yes\n | hof        = \n | probowl    = yes\n}}\n{{NFL team draft entry\n | round      = 2\n | pick       = 37\n | player     = [[Darren Woodson]]\n | position   = [[Safety (gridiron football position)|S]]\n | college    = [[Arizona State Sun Devils football|Arizona State]]\n | notes      = \n | maderoster = yes\n | hof        = \n | probowl    = yes\n}}\n{{NFL team draft end}}\n\n==Regular season==\nThe season would start off with two crucial wins against the [[Washington Redskins]] and the [[New York Giants]], both victors of the previous two Super Bowls.  A ferocious Dallas defense, with not a single player nominated to the Pro Bowl, placed first in the NFL in total defense.  Running back Emmitt Smith would also collect his second straight NFL rushing title.    \nThe 1992 season would also see a renewed rivalry between the [[Dallas Cowboys|Cowboys]] and the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship game set over a decade after the famous play known as [[The Catch (American football)|The Catch]].  This ultimately started the rise of the 49ers and fall of the Cowboys throughout the 1980s.   The rise of the 1990s Cowboys was christened with a 30\u201320 victory against San Francisco at Candlestick Park.  Both franchises would later meet again in the next two [[National Football Conference|NFC]] Championship games in what many consider to be a classic series of contest of future Hall of Fame players.\n\nAt the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]], site of Super Bowl XXVII, the Cowboys would struggle early, finding themselves down 0\u20137, but later regroup when Aikman's pass to tight end [[Jay Novacek]] tied the game 7\u20137.  From there, Dallas would gain all momentum and rout the [[Buffalo Bills]] 52\u201317, forcing a record 9 turnovers and knocking [[Buffalo Bills|Bills]] [[quarterback]] [[Jim Kelly]] out of the game.  [[Troy Aikman]] would earn [[Super Bowl MVP]] honors after completing 22 of 30 passes for 273 yards and 4 touchdowns to wrap up a phenomenal postseason performance.\n\nNotable additions to the team this year included [[defensive end]] [[Charles Haley]], [[cornerback]] [[Kevin Smith (football player)|Kevin Smith]], [[linebacker]] [[Robert Jones (American football)|Robert Jones]], [[Safety (football position)|safety]] [[Thomas Everett]], [[Safety (football position)|safety]] [[Darren Woodson]] and [[wide receiver]] [[Jimmy Smith (wide receiver)|Jimmy Smith]] (though Smith would never catch a pass during his time with the team).\n\nThe Dallas defense (nicknamed \"[[Doomsday II]]\") enjoyed a renaissance, but has never received due credit for its achievements:\n\n* It was only the third defense since [[1980 NFL season|1980]] to hold opponents to fewer than 4,000 yards in a 16-game season. The other defenses to have done it are recognized as two of the greatest of modern era \u2013 the [[1984 Chicago Bears season|1984 Chicago Bears]] and the [[1991 Philadelphia Eagles season|1991 Philadelphia Eagles]].\n* It was the second defense to rank No. 1 in fewest yards yielded without sending a player to the [[Pro Bowl]]. The [[1983 NFL season|1983]] [[Cincinnati Bengals]], who had a losing record were the first.\n* The defense finished first in the [[National Football League|NFL]] in total defense (245.8 yards-per-game), while the secondary finished the year fifth in passing defense (168.1 yards-per-game).\n* It led the [[National Football League|NFL]] in defense against the rush and fewest first downs allowed. Its league lead in preventing third-down conversions was staggering. Dallas's opponents converted 27.2 percent. The [[Seattle Seahawks]] ranked second at 32.6 percent.\n* It set a club record by holding the [[Seattle Seahawks]] to 62 yards in a 27\u20130 victory and closed the season by holding the [[Chicago Bears]] to fewer than 100 yards.\n* [[Super Bowl XXVII]] saw the Cowboys defense at its best, producing a [[Super Bowl]] record 9 turnovers (5 fumbles and 4 interceptions) and even scoring two [[touchdown]]s.\n* Four starters were rookies or second year players ([[Russell Maryland]], [[Robert Jones (American football)|Robert Jones]], [[Larry Brown (cornerback)|Larry Brown]] and [[Kevin Smith (football player)|Kevin Smith]]), and two other joined the team after the preseason ([[Charles Haley]] and [[Thomas Everett]]).\n* This version of the \"[[Doomsday Defense]]\" had tremendous speed and depth. They were also young, with the age of the starters averaging 25 \u00bd years.\n\n===Schedule===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Week\n!Opponent\n!Result\n!TV Time\n!Attendance\n!Record\n|-bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\"\n|1\n|[[Washington Redskins]]\n|W 23-10\n|ABC 8:00pm\n|<center>63,538</center>\n|1\u20130\n|-bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\"\n|2\n|at [[New York Giants]]\n|W 34-28\n|CBS 12:00pm\n|<center>76,430</center>\n|2\u20130\n|-bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\"\n|3\n|[[Phoenix Cardinals]]\n|W 31-20\n|CBS 3:00pm\n|<center>62,575</center>\n|3\u20130\n|-\n|4\n| Bye\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-bgcolor=\"#ffdddd\"\n|5\n|at [[Philadelphia Eagles]]\n|L 7-31\n|ABC 8:00pm\n|<center>66,572</center>\n|3\u20131\n|-bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\"\n|6\n|[[Seattle Seahawks]]\n|W 27-0\n|NBC 12:00pm\n|<center>62,311</center>\n|4\u20131\n|-bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\"\n|7\n|[[Kansas City Chiefs]]\n|W 17-10\n|NBC 12:00pm\n|<center>64,115</center>\n|5\u20131\n|-bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\"\n|8\n|at [[Los Angeles Raiders]]\n|W 28-13\n|CBS 3:00pm\n|<center>91,505</center>\n|6\u20131\n|-bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\"\n|9\n|Philadelphia Eagles\n|W 20-10\n|CBS 3:00pm\n|<center>65,012</center>\n|7\u20131\n|-bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\"\n|10\n|at [[Detroit Lions]]\n|W 37-3\n|CBS 12:00pm\n|<center>74,816</center>\n|8\u20131\n|-bgcolor=\"#ffdddd\"\n|11\n|[[Los Angeles Rams (1946\u201394)|Los Angeles Rams]]\n|L 23-27\n|CBS 3:00pm\n|<center>63,690</center>\n|8\u20132\n|-bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\"\n|12\n|at Phoenix Cardinals\n|W 16-10\n|CBS 3:00pm\n|<center>72,439</center>\n|9\u20132\n|-bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\"\n|13\n|New York Giants\n|W 30-3\n|CBS 3:00pm\n|<center>62,416</center>\n|10\u20132\n|-bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\"\n|14\n|at [[Denver Broncos]]\n|W 31-27\n|CBS 3:00pm\n|<center>74,946</center>\n|11\u20132\n|-bgcolor=\"#ffdddd\"\n|15\n|at Washington Redskins\n|L 17-20\n|CBS 3:00pm\n|<center>56,437</center>\n|11\u20133\n|-bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\"\n|16\n|at [[Atlanta Falcons]] \n|W 41-17\n|ABC 8:00pm\n|<center>67,036</center>\n|12\u20133\n|-bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\"\n|17\n|[[Chicago Bears]] \n|W 27-14\n|CBS 3:00pm\n|<center>63,101</center>\n|13\u20133\n|}\n\n===Standings===\n{{1992 NFC East standings}}\n\n===Game summaries===\n\n====Week 1: vs Washington Redskins====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle= {{NFLPrimaryColor|Dallas Cowboys}}; {{NFLSecondaryColor|Dallas Cowboys}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title= Week 1: Washington Redskins at Dallas Cowboys\n |date=September 7\n |time=9:00 p.m. EST\n |road=Redskins\n |R1=0 |R2=7 |R3=0 |R4=3\n |home='''Cowboys'''\n |H1=9 |H2=7 |H3=7 |H4=0\n |stadium=[[Texas Stadium]], Irving, Texas\n |attendance=\n |weather=83\u00b0F (Clear/Humid)\n |referee=[[Dick Hantak]]\n |TV= ABC\n |TVAnnouncers=[[Al Michaels]], [[Frank Gifford]], and [[Dan Dierdorf]]\n\n |scoring=\n}}\n\n====Week 2: at New York Giants====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle= {{NFLPrimaryColor|Dallas Cowboys}}; {{NFLSecondaryColor|Dallas Cowboys}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title= Week 2: Dallas Cowboys at New York Giants\n |date=September 13\n |time=1:00 p.m. EST\n |road='''Cowboys'''\n |R1=17 |R2=10 |R3=7 |R4=0\n |home=Giants\n |H1=0 |H2=0 |H3=14 |H4=14\n |stadium=[[Giants Stadium]], East Rutherford, New Jersey\n |attendance=\n |weather=64\u00b0F (Clear)\n |referee=[[Tom White (American football official)|Tom White]]\n |TV= CBS\n |TVAnnouncers=[[Verne Lundquist]] and [[John Madden]]\n |reference=\n |scoring=\n}}\nThe Cowboys won despite giving up the game's final 28 points.\n\n====Week 3: vs Phoenix Cardinals====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle= {{NFLPrimaryColor|Dallas Cowboys}}; {{NFLSecondaryColor|Dallas Cowboys}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title= Week 3: Arizona Cardinals at Dallas Cowboys\n |date=September 20\n |time=4:00 p.m. EST\n |road=Cardinals\n |R1=7 |R2=3 |R3=3 |R4=7\n |home='''Cowboys'''\n |H1=14 |H2=7 |H3=7 |H4=3\n |stadium=[[Texas Stadium]], Irving, Texas\n |attendance=\n |weather=84\u00b0F (Clear/Humid)\n |referee=[[Red Cashion]]\n |TV= CBS\n |TVAnnouncers=[[Dick Stockton]] and [[Randy Cross]]\n |reference=\n |scoring=\n}}\n\n====Week 5: at Philadelphia Eagles====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle= {{NFLPrimaryColor|Dallas Cowboys}}; {{NFLSecondaryColor|Dallas Cowboys}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title= Week 5: Dallas Cowboys at Philadelphia Eagles\n |date=October 5\n |time=9:00 p.m. EST\n |road=Cowboys\n |R1=7 |R2=0 |R3=0 |R4=0\n |home='''Eagles'''\n |H1=10 |H2=0 |H3=7 |H4=14\n |stadium=[[Veterans Stadium]], Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n |attendance=\n |weather=55\u00b0F (Clear)\n |referee=[[Jerry Markbreit]]\n |TV= [[Monday Night Football|ABC]]\n |TVAnnouncers=[[Al Michaels]], [[Frank Gifford]], and [[Dan Dierdorf]]\n |reference=\n |scoring=\n}}\nThe Cowboys were defeated in their first meeting with Eagles running back [[Herschel Walker]] since they traded him from Dallas to [[1989 Minnesota Vikings season|the Vikings]] during the 1989 season.
