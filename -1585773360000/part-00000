Airing live and nationwide on the [[NBC Radio Network]], it originally aired beginning Saturday morning at 8am and continuing through the weekend until 12 midnight on Sunday. However, after the first few months, the full weekend broadcast was shortened when the midnight-to-dawn hours were dropped since few NBC stations carried it.\n\nThe program offered a magazine-of-the-air mix of news, sports, comedy, variety, music, celebrity interviews and other short segments (along with records, usually of popular middle-of-the-road songs, especially in its later years). Its length and eclectic format were radical departures from the traditional radio programming structure of 30- and 60-minute programs and represented an ambitious attempt to respond to the rise of [[television]] as America's major home-entertainment medium.\n\nThe show was the brainchild of legendary NBC radio and television network president [[Pat Weaver|Sylvester (Pat) Weaver]], whose career bridged classic radio and television's infancy and who sought to keep radio alive in a television age. Believing that broadcasting could and should educate as well as entertain, Weaver fashioned a series to do both with some of the best-remembered and best-regarded names in broadcasting, entertainment, journalism, and literature taking part. ''Monitor'' and the Sunday-afternoon TV documentary series ''[[Wide Wide World]]'' were Weaver's last two major contributions to NBC, as he left the network within a year of ''Monitor'''s premiere.\n\n==''Monitor'' Beacon==\nThe enduring audio signature of the show was the \"''Monitor'' Beacon\" - a mix of audio-manipulated telephone tones and the sound of an oscillator emitting the Morse code signal for the letter \"M\", for \"Monitor\". It was described by one source as \"a tape loop made from a sequence of 1950s AT&T telephone line [[Multi-frequency signaling|switching tones]] generated by analog oscillators\".<ref>[http://www.classicthemes.com/oldTimeRadioThemes/radioTitleIndex.html OTR Theme Title Index]</ref>\n\nThe Beacon introduced the show and was used in transitions, for example, to station breaks, accompanied by the tag line: \"You're on the ''Monitor'' beacon.\"\n\n==Anchors and hosts==\n[[File:Monitor sunday afternoon evening staff 1957.JPG|thumb|230px|left|''Monitor'' Sunday afternoon and evening staff in Radio Central, 1957.  From left: Frank Gallop, Lorna Lynn (Monitor Medley Girl), Dave Garroway, Tedi Thurman (Miss Monitor), and Ben Grauer.]]\nWhen ''Monitor'' began on June 12, 1955 at 4pm, the first hour of the program was simulcast on NBC-TV. That initial June 12 broadcast lasted eight hours, from 4pm through 12 midnight. Following the Monitor beacon, [[Morgan Beatty]] was the first voice ever heard on ''Monitor''. After an introduction by Pat Weaver, news headlines by [[Dave Garroway]] and a routine by [[Bob and Ray]], Garroway cued ''Monitor'''s opening music remote: live jazz by [[Howard Rumsey|Howard Rumsey and the Lighthouse All-Stars]] at the [[Lighthouse Caf\u00e9]] in [[Hermosa Beach, California]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=epdRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=52sDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5173,5277013&dq=dave+garroway+monitor&hl=en|title='Monitor' to debut on KDKA Sunday|date=10 June 1955|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=17 March 2012}}</ref> It was the first of many jazz remotes in the weeks to come.\n\nOn the following Saturday, June 18, ''Monitor'' began broadcasting 40 consecutive hours each weekend, from 8am on Saturday to midnight on Sunday. ''Monitor'' aired from a mammoth NBC studio called Radio Central, created especially for the program, on the fifth floor of the [[GE Building|RCA Building]] in midtown Manhattan (the same space which is now home to [[MSNBC]]). NBC unveiled Radio Central to the national television audience during a segment in the October 16, 1955 premiere of ''Wide Wide World'', including a ''Monitor'' interview with [[Alfred Hitchcock]] (seen through glass in an adjacent studio and minus audio) and a ''Monitor'' newscast (with audio). Built at a cost of $150,000 the glass-enclosed studios of Radio Central were described by Pat Weaver as \"a listening post of the world\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LnE_AAAAIBAJ&sjid=plQMAAAAIBAJ&pg=614,3180587&dq=frank+gallop&hl=en|title=Electronic Listening Post To Feed Radio's 'Monitor'|author=Slifka, Adrian M.|date=10 June 1955|publisher=Youngstown Vindicator|accessdate=30 October 2010}}</ref>\n[[File:Bob and Ray Tedi Thurman Monitor.gif|150px|thumb|''Monitor'' publicity shot of [[Tedi Thurman]] as Miss Monitor with [[Bob Elliott (comedian)|Bob Elliott]] (right) and [[Ray Goulding]].]]\n\nFrom Radio Central, anchors and hosts, initially dubbed \"communicators\", presided over three or four-hour segments of the show.

Morgan]] and [[Wolfman Jack]] helmed the Saturday evening segment until it was eliminated. The last hosts of ''Monitor'' in 1975 were [[Big Wilson]] and John Bartholomew Tucker. Behind the scenes, ''Monitor'''s executive producers included Jim Fleming, Frank Papp, Al Capstaff and Bob Maurer.\n\n==Features and personalities==\n[[File:Marlene Dietrich Monitor NBC Radio.JPG|thumb|150px|Marlene Dietrich was a regular ''Monitor'' advisor on emotional problems.]]\nRemote segments originating from locations around the country were a regular part of ''Monitor'', setting it apart from studio-bound broadcasts and taking advantage of network radio's reach. A weekend might include reports from a festival in Tucson, a golf championship in North Carolina, NBC's correspondent in Moscow, or on preparations for the Olympic Games in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nRegular segments included \"Celebrity Chef\", \"Ring Around the World\", and \"On the Line with Bob Considine\". On-the-spot live remote broadcasts from New York City jazz clubs on Saturday evenings included both jazz groups and vocalists, such as [[Al Hibbler]].\n\nIn the show's early years, weather reports were delivered in a breathy, sexy voice by actress [[Tedi Thurman]] in the role of Miss Monitor. Various broadcasting personalities heard delivering reports and segments included Jerry Baker (the Master Gardener), Morgan Beatty, [[Dr. Joyce Brothers|Joyce Brothers]], [[Al Capp]], [[Paul Christman]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], Len Dillon, [[Chris Economaki]], [[Arlene Francis]], [[Betty Furness]], [[Curt Gowdy]], [[Skitch Henderson]], [[Chet Huntley]], [[Graham Kerr]] (the Galloping Gourmet), [[Joe Kirkwood, Jr.]], Fran Koltun; [[Sandy Koufax]], [[Bill Mazer]], [[Lindsey Nelson]], [[Kyle Rote]], [[Gene Shalit]], [[Jim Simpson (sportscaster)|Jim Simpson]], [[Barbara Walters]], [[Tony Zappone]] and many [[NBC News]] correspondents.\n\n==Comedy==\nMany comedy talents appeared through the years including [[Woody Allen]], [[Bill Cosby]], [[Selma Diamond]], [[Phyllis Diller]], [[Bob Hope]], [[Ernie Kovacs]], [[Bob Newhart]], [[Jean Shepherd]] and [[Jonathan Winters]]. The comedy team of [[Mike Nichols]] and [[Elaine May]] appeared on ''Monitor'', as did [[Jerry Stiller]] and [[Anne Meara]]. [[Bob and Ray]], who won a 1957 [[Peabody Award]] for their ''Monitor'' comedy routines, often remained at NBC during the weekend to step in if technical problems developed with remote segments.\n\n[[Image:Peglynch.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Peg Lynch]] wrote and performed ''Ethel and Albert'' for ''Monitor'' from 1963-1965.]]\nIn addition to Bob and Ray, several ''Monitor'' regulars in its early years helped the show bridge the classic and modern radio eras. [[Henry Morgan (comedian)|Henry Morgan]] had been a controversial radio comedian in the 1940s. [[Clifton Fadiman]] was the legendary host of ''[[Information Please]]'', the highbrow quiz show. Mel Allen and Red Barber were familiar baseball voices (respectively, the [[New York Yankees]] and the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]]) since the 1940s. [[Garry Moore]] rose to fame as [[Jimmy Durante]]'s radio sidekick. [[Bert Parks]] was host of the radio hits ''Stop the Music'' and ''[[Break the Bank (1948 game show)|Break the Bank]]''.\n\nSeveral radio comedy shows were revived in the form of regular five-minute ''Monitor'' segments, including ''[[Duffy's Tavern]]''. [[Jim Jordan (actor)|Jim]] and [[Marian Driscoll Jordan|Marian Jordan]], better known as old-time radio favorites ''[[Fibber McGee and Molly]]'', held down a regular ''Monitor'' segment and were said to be negotiating a new, long-term commitment to the show when Marian died of cancer in 1961. [[Peg Lynch]] and [[Alan Coe Bunce|Alan Bunce]], vintage radio's ''[[Ethel and Albert]]'', also performed five-minute ''Monitor'' vignettes from 1963-1965. Lynch made several of the vignettes available on compact disc for OTR collectors.<ref>[http://www.bostonpete.com/plcd-vol001.html  ''Ethel and Albert''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516201014/http://www.bostonpete.com/plcd-vol001.html |date=2006-05-16 }}</ref>\n\n==Later years==\nThe innovative approach of ''Monitor'' made it a profitable success for NBC Radio over many years, helping to sustain the network in an era when network radio was collapsing. Its strong start and high popularity led the show to air on Friday nights from 8pm to 10pm in 1957, followed by an expansion to weeknights in 1959, all in addition to its 32 weekend hours (reduced from 40 in late 1955).\n\nBy 1961,  the weeknight ''Monitor'' was gone and the weekend schedule cut in half - from 32 to 16 hours each weekend. This was not quite as drastic a cut as it seems, as some programming that had been counted as part of ''Monitor's'' 32 hours\u2014such as Sunday morning religious broadcasts and the radio version of ''[[Meet the Press]]''\u2014continued to air on NBC outside of the ''Monitor'' schedule. This was further shortened in 1974 to only 12 live weekend hours (plus nine repeated hours).\n\nRadio stations, especially in large markets, had increasingly adopted personality-driven formats featuring local disc jockeys and sought to establish a clear-cut musical or talk identity for themselves. Because of this, ''Monitor'''s \"something-for-everyone\" programming often did not fit in with schedules and viewpoints of stations, and fewer affiliates carried the program in major markets. Due to this, many of the show's sponsors also pulled away, requiring a shortening of the schedule to keep costs low.\n\nNBC refused to get rid of its biggest money-making show without a fight. The network introduced new music formats and changed hosts. It hired Don Imus, Wolfman Jack and Robert W. Morgan to alternate on Saturday-night segments in an attempt to make the format faster-paced. NBC also created a \"custom package\" to allow stations to carry certain portions as they saw fit.\n\nDespite NBC's efforts, it had appeared that ''Monitor'''s time had come and gone. The network finally gave up fighting the trend by Fall 1974 and simply continued planning and programming the show's six-hour blocks for each Saturday and Sunday, now reduced between 6 p.m. and midnight on Saturdays and noon and 6 p.m. on Sundays.\n\n===The final weekend===\nOn January 25 and 26, 1975, ''Monitor'' spent its last 12 hours looking back on its 20-year history of more than 20,000-plus hours with hosts Big Wilson and John Bartholomew Tucker. Many clips were played, including Dave Garroway's interview with Marilyn Monroe on the show's first day, Frank McGee's talk with Martin Luther King Jr. in the early 1960s, Bob and Ray spoofing \"Miss Monitor\" and reporter Helen Hall riding on a roller-coaster.\n\nOn January 26, Wilson hosted from noon to 3pm while Tucker hosted from 3 to 6pm. The program's last guest was Hugh Downs, who talked about his earlier days on ''Monitor'' with Tucker. During the show's final minutes [[Sammy Cahn]] sang about the show's history (\"Monitor: It's Been a Long, Long Time\"), followed by Tucker thanking the listeners and staff, after which he said his last farewell. The final sound heard on ''Monitor'' was of the \"Beacon\", followed by the NBC chimes at 5:58:50pm.\n\nAbout 125 stations still carried the program on its last day, with few in major markets.\n\nIn 1983, NBC revived the title for a short-lived television news program, ''[[Monitor (U.S. TV series)|Monitor]]'', hosted by [[Lloyd Dobyns]]. The show was renamed ''First Camera'' and was canceled in 1984.\n\n==Listen to==\n* [http://monitorbeacon.net/sounds/Monitor_Beacon.mp3 ''Monitor'' Beacon]\n* [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4700009 NPR: Liane Hansen talks with Dennis Hart on the 50th anniversary of ''Monitor'' (6/12/05)]\n* [http://www.monitorbeacon.net/sounds/MissMoni.rm Miss Monitor (Tedi Thurman)] ([[RealPlayer]])\n* [http://www.monitorbeacon.net/sounds/monitor-1959-hall.mp3 ''Monitor'' (June 6, 1959, 11am to noon ET, Saturday] with Bob and Ray, Ernie Kovacs, Miss Monitor, Bob Wilson, [[Monty Hall]], Herb Kaplow, Longines Chorus and Orchestra, segment on airline ticketing via \"electronic brain\" in Copenhagen ([[MP3]] format)\n* [http://www.thejoyboys.com/sound/d213t4.mp3 \"Miss Janitor\", the Joy Boys' parody of Miss Monitor (February 10, 1961)] ([[MP3]] format)\n* [http://www.monitorbeacon.net/sounds/monitor-1964-nelson.mp3 ''Monitor'': Nichols and May (September 1964)] ([[MP3]] format)\n\n==See also==\n* [[Radio in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Notes==\n*Hart, Dennis.

Airing live and nationwide on the [[NBC Radio Network]], it originally aired beginning Saturday morning at 8am and continuing through the weekend until 12 midnight on Sunday. However, after the first few months, the full weekend broadcast was shortened when the midnight-to-dawn hours were dropped since few NBC stations carried it.\n\nThe program offered a magazine-of-the-air mix of news, sports, comedy, variety, music, celebrity interviews and other short segments (along with records, usually of popular middle-of-the-road songs, especially in its later years). Its length and eclectic format were radical departures from the traditional radio programming structure of 30- and 60-minute programs and represented an ambitious attempt to respond to the rise of [[television]] as America's major home-entertainment medium.\n\nThe show was the brainchild of legendary NBC radio and television network president [[Pat Weaver|Sylvester (Pat) Weaver]], whose career bridged classic radio and television's infancy and who sought to keep radio alive in a television age. Believing that broadcasting could and should educate as well as entertain, Weaver fashioned a series to do both with some of the best-remembered and best-regarded names in broadcasting, entertainment, journalism, and literature taking part. ''Monitor'' and the Sunday-afternoon TV documentary series ''[[Wide Wide World]]'' were Weaver's last two major contributions to NBC, as he left the network within a year of ''Monitor'''s premiere.\n\n==''Monitor'' Beacon==\nThe enduring audio signature of the show was the \"''Monitor'' Beacon\" - a mix of audio-manipulated telephone tones and the sound of an oscillator emitting the Morse code signal for the letter \"M\", for \"Monitor\". It was described by one source as \"a tape loop made from a sequence of 1950s AT&T telephone line [[Multi-frequency signaling|switching tones]] generated by analog oscillators\".<ref>[http://www.classicthemes.com/oldTimeRadioThemes/radioTitleIndex.html OTR Theme Title Index]</ref>\n\nThe Beacon introduced the show and was used in transitions, for example, to station breaks, accompanied by the tag line: \"You're on the ''Monitor'' beacon.\"\n\n==Anchors and hosts==\n[[File:Monitor sunday afternoon evening staff 1957.JPG|thumb|230px|left|''Monitor'' Sunday afternoon and evening staff in Radio Central, 1957.

That initial June 12 broadcast lasted eight hours, from 4pm through 12 midnight. Following the Monitor beacon, [[Morgan Beatty]] was the first voice ever heard on ''Monitor''. After an introduction by Pat Weaver, news headlines by [[Dave Garroway]] and a routine by [[Bob and Ray]], Garroway cued ''Monitor'''s opening music remote: live jazz by [[Howard Rumsey|Howard Rumsey and the Lighthouse All-Stars]] at the [[Lighthouse Caf\u00e9]] in [[Hermosa Beach, California]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=epdRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=52sDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5173,5277013&dq=dave+garroway+monitor&hl=en|title='Monitor' to debut on KDKA Sunday|date=10 June 1955|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=17 March 2012}}</ref> It was the first of many jazz remotes in the weeks to come.\n\nOn the following Saturday, June 18, ''Monitor'' began broadcasting 40 consecutive hours each weekend, from 8am on Saturday to midnight on Sunday. ''Monitor'' aired from a mammoth NBC studio called Radio Central, created especially for the program, on the fifth floor of the [[GE Building|RCA Building]] in midtown Manhattan (the same space which is now home to [[MSNBC]]). NBC unveiled Radio Central to the national television audience during a segment in the October 16, 1955 premiere of ''Wide Wide World'', including a ''Monitor'' interview with [[Alfred Hitchcock]] (seen through glass in an adjacent studio and minus audio) and a ''Monitor'' newscast (with audio). Built at a cost of $150,000 the glass-enclosed studios of Radio Central were described by Pat Weaver as \"a listening post of the world\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LnE_AAAAIBAJ&sjid=plQMAAAAIBAJ&pg=614,3180587&dq=frank+gallop&hl=en|title=Electronic Listening Post To Feed Radio's 'Monitor'|author=Slifka, Adrian M.|date=10 June 1955|publisher=Youngstown Vindicator|accessdate=30 October 2010}}</ref>\n[[File:Bob and Ray Tedi Thurman Monitor.gif|150px|thumb|''Monitor'' publicity shot of [[Tedi Thurman]] as Miss Monitor with [[Bob Elliott (comedian)|Bob Elliott]] (right) and [[Ray Goulding]].]]\n\nFrom Radio Central, anchors and hosts, initially dubbed \"communicators\", presided over three or four-hour segments of the show.

Morgan]] and [[Wolfman Jack]] helmed the Saturday evening segment until it was eliminated. The last hosts of ''Monitor'' in 1975 were [[Big Wilson]] and John Bartholomew Tucker. Behind the scenes, ''Monitor'''s executive producers included Jim Fleming, Frank Papp, Al Capstaff and Bob Maurer.\n\n==Features and personalities==\n[[File:Marlene Dietrich Monitor NBC Radio.JPG|thumb|150px|Marlene Dietrich was a regular ''Monitor'' advisor on emotional problems.]]\nRemote segments originating from locations around the country were a regular part of ''Monitor'', setting it apart from studio-bound broadcasts and taking advantage of network radio's reach. A weekend might include reports from a festival in Tucson, a golf championship in North Carolina, NBC's correspondent in Moscow, or on preparations for the Olympic Games in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nRegular segments included \"Celebrity Chef\", \"Ring Around the World\", and \"On the Line with Bob Considine\". On-the-spot live remote broadcasts from New York City jazz clubs on Saturday evenings included both jazz groups and vocalists, such as [[Al Hibbler]].\n\nIn the show's early years, weather reports were delivered in a breathy, sexy voice by actress [[Tedi Thurman]] in the role of Miss Monitor. Various broadcasting personalities heard delivering reports and segments included Jerry Baker (the Master Gardener), Morgan Beatty, [[Dr. Joyce Brothers|Joyce Brothers]], [[Al Capp]], [[Paul Christman]], [[Marlene Dietrich]], Len Dillon, [[Chris Economaki]], [[Arlene Francis]], [[Betty Furness]], [[Curt Gowdy]], [[Skitch Henderson]], [[Chet Huntley]], [[Graham Kerr]] (the Galloping Gourmet), [[Joe Kirkwood, Jr.]], Fran Koltun; [[Sandy Koufax]], [[Bill Mazer]], [[Lindsey Nelson]], [[Kyle Rote]], [[Gene Shalit]], [[Jim Simpson (sportscaster)|Jim Simpson]], [[Barbara Walters]], [[Tony Zappone]] and many [[NBC News]] correspondents.\n\n==Comedy==\nMany comedy talents appeared through the years including [[Woody Allen]], [[Bill Cosby]], [[Selma Diamond]], [[Phyllis Diller]], [[Bob Hope]], [[Ernie Kovacs]], [[Bob Newhart]], [[Jean Shepherd]] and [[Jonathan Winters]]. The comedy team of [[Mike Nichols]] and [[Elaine May]] appeared on ''Monitor'', as did [[Jerry Stiller]] and [[Anne Meara]]. [[Bob and Ray]], who won a 1957 [[Peabody Award]] for their ''Monitor'' comedy routines, often remained at NBC during the weekend to step in if technical problems developed with remote segments.\n\n[[Image:Peglynch.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Peg Lynch]] wrote and performed ''Ethel and Albert'' for ''Monitor'' from 1963-1965.]]\nIn addition to Bob and Ray, several ''Monitor'' regulars in its early years helped the show bridge the classic and modern radio eras. [[Henry Morgan (comedian)|Henry Morgan]] had been a controversial radio comedian in the 1940s. [[Clifton Fadiman]] was the legendary host of ''[[Information Please]]'', the highbrow quiz show. Mel Allen and Red Barber were familiar baseball voices (respectively, the [[New York Yankees]] and the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]]) since the 1940s. [[Garry Moore]] rose to fame as [[Jimmy Durante]]'s radio sidekick. [[Bert Parks]] was host of the radio hits ''Stop the Music'' and ''[[Break the Bank (1948 game show)|Break the Bank]]''.\n\nSeveral radio comedy shows were revived in the form of regular five-minute ''Monitor'' segments, including ''[[Duffy's Tavern]]''. [[Jim Jordan (actor)|Jim]] and [[Marian Driscoll Jordan|Marian Jordan]], better known as old-time radio favorites ''[[Fibber McGee and Molly]]'', held down a regular ''Monitor'' segment and were said to be negotiating a new, long-term commitment to the show when Marian died of cancer in 1961. [[Peg Lynch]] and [[Alan Coe Bunce|Alan Bunce]], vintage radio's ''[[Ethel and Albert]]'', also performed five-minute ''Monitor'' vignettes from 1963-1965. Lynch made several of the vignettes available on compact disc for OTR collectors.<ref>[http://www.bostonpete.com/plcd-vol001.html  ''Ethel and Albert''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516201014/http://www.bostonpete.com/plcd-vol001.html |date=2006-05-16 }}</ref>\n\n==Later years==\nThe innovative approach of ''Monitor'' made it a profitable success for NBC Radio over many years, helping to sustain the network in an era when network radio was collapsing. Its strong start and high popularity led the show to air on Friday nights from 8pm to 10pm in 1957, followed by an expansion to weeknights in 1959, all in addition to its 32 weekend hours (reduced from 40 in late 1955).\n\nBy 1961,  the weeknight ''Monitor'' was gone and the weekend schedule cut in half - from 32 to 16 hours each weekend. This was not quite as drastic a cut as it seems, as some programming that had been counted as part of ''Monitor's'' 32 hours\u2014such as Sunday morning religious broadcasts and the radio version of ''[[Meet the Press]]''\u2014continued to air on NBC outside of the ''Monitor'' schedule. This was further shortened in 1974 to only 12 live weekend hours (plus nine repeated hours).\n\nRadio stations, especially in large markets, had increasingly adopted personality-driven formats featuring local disc jockeys and sought to establish a clear-cut musical or talk identity for themselves. Because of this, ''Monitor'''s \"something-for-everyone\" programming often did not fit in with schedules and viewpoints of stations, and fewer affiliates carried the program in major markets. Due to this, many of the show's sponsors also pulled away, requiring a shortening of the schedule to keep costs low.\n\nNBC refused to get rid of its biggest money-making show without a fight. The network introduced new music formats and changed hosts. It hired Don Imus, Wolfman Jack and Robert W. Morgan to alternate on Saturday-night segments in an attempt to make the format faster-paced. NBC also created a \"custom package\" to allow stations to carry certain portions as they saw fit.\n\nDespite NBC's efforts, it had appeared that ''Monitor'''s time had come and gone. The network finally gave up fighting the trend by Fall 1974 and simply continued planning and programming the show's six-hour blocks for each Saturday and Sunday, now reduced between 6 p.m. and midnight on Saturdays and noon and 6 p.m. on Sundays.\n\n===The final weekend===\nOn January 25 and 26, 1975, spent its last 12 hours looking back on its 20-year history of more than 20,000-plus hours with hosts Big Wilson and John Bartholomew Tucker. Many clips were played, including Dave Garroway's interview with Marilyn Monroe on the show's first day, Frank McGee's talk with Martin Luther King Jr. in the early 1960s, Bob and Ray spoofing \"Miss Monitor\" and reporter Helen Hall riding on a roller-coaster.\n\nOn January 26, Wilson hosted from noon to 3pm while Tucker hosted from 3-6pm. The program's last guest was Hugh Downs, who talked about his earlier days on ''Monitor'' with Tucker. During the show's final minutes [[Sammy Cahn]] sang about the show's history (\"Monitor: It's Been a Long, Long Time\"), followed by Tucker thanking the listeners and staff, after which he said his last farewell. The final sound heard on ''Monitor'' was of the \"Beacon\", followed by the NBC chimes at 5:58:50pm.\n\nAbout 125 stations still carried the program on its last day, with few in major markets.\n\nIn 1983, NBC revived the title for a short-lived television news program, ''[[Monitor (U.S. TV series)|Monitor]]'', hosted by [[Lloyd Dobyns]]. The show was renamed ''First Camera'' and was canceled in 1984.\n\n==Listen to==\n* [http://monitorbeacon.net/sounds/Monitor_Beacon.mp3 ''Monitor'' Beacon]\n* [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4700009 NPR: Liane Hansen talks with Dennis Hart on the 50th anniversary of ''Monitor'' (6/12/05)]\n* [http://www.monitorbeacon.net/sounds/MissMoni.rm Miss Monitor (Tedi Thurman)] ([[RealPlayer]])\n* [http://www.monitorbeacon.net/sounds/monitor-1959-hall.mp3 ''Monitor'' (June 6, 1959, 11am to noon ET, Saturday] with Bob and Ray, Ernie Kovacs, Miss Monitor, Bob Wilson, [[Monty Hall]], Herb Kaplow, Longines Chorus and Orchestra, segment on airline ticketing via \"electronic brain\" in Copenhagen ([[MP3]] format)\n* [http://www.thejoyboys.com/sound/d213t4.mp3 \"Miss Janitor\", the Joy Boys' parody of Miss Monitor (February 10, 1961)] ([[MP3]] format)\n* [http://www.monitorbeacon.net/sounds/monitor-1964-nelson.mp3 ''Monitor'': Nichols and May (September 1964)] ([[MP3]] format)\n\n==See also==\n* [[Radio in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Notes==\n*Hart, Dennis.

The primary feature of an AR relationship is whether a person ranks above or below each other person. Those higher in rank hold greater authority, prestige and privileges, while subordinates are entitled to guidance and protection. Military ranks are a prototypical example of an AR relationship.<ref name=\"Fiske1992\" />\n\n'''Equality matching (EM)''' relationships are those characterized by various forms of one-for-one correspondence, such as turn taking, in-kind [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]], tit-for-tat retaliation, or eye-for-an-eye revenge. Parties in EM relationships are primarily concerned with ensuring the relationship is in a balanced state. Non-intimate acquaintances are a prototypical example.<ref name=\"Fiske1992\" />\n\n'''Market pricing (MP)''' relationships revolve around a model of proportionality where people attend to ratios and rates and relevant features are typically reduced to a single value or utility metric that allows the comparison (e.g., the price of a sale). Monetary transactions are a prototypical example of MP relationships.<ref name=\"Fiske1992\" />\n\nThe four relational models are argued to be innate, intrinsically motivated, and [[Cultural universal|culturally universal]] (though with culture-specific implementations).<ref name=\"Fiske2007\" /> These four elementary relationships can be combined to form more complex configurations of relationships called meta-relational models that entail or prohibit certain obligations, behaviors or relationships between [[Dyad (sociology)|dyads]] within the configuration (e.g., A being in a CS relationship with B prohibits B from being in a CS relationship with A's enemy, C).<ref name=\"Fiske2012\">{{cite journal |last1=Fiske |first1=Alan Page |title=Metarelational models: Configurations of social relationships |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |date=February 2012 |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=2\u201318 |doi=10.1002/ejsp.847 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to RMT, mis-matching of relational models is a common cause of interpersonal [[Conflict (process)|conflict]], given that different relational models will often imply different behaviors in the same situation. Taking two housemates sharing dishwashing as a simple example, Fiske suggests<ref name=\"Fiske2007\" /> that if housemate A assumes dishwashing is governed by a CS framework and housemate B assumes an EM framework, A will expect both of them to wash dishes whenever they can, and B will expect them to take turns. If A is busy and B is not, A will expect B to wash the dishes, but if B washed the dishes last, they'll assume it's A's turn, and conflict will ensue because of A and B's mis-matched relational models.\n\n===Correspondence with Stevens's levels of measurement===\nFiske proposed that the four discrete types of relationships correspond to Stevens's four [[levels of measurement]].<ref name=\"Fiske1992\" /> CS relationships resemble the categorical (nominal) scales of measurement in that all members of the relationship are equivalent. AR resembles an ordinal scale given that members of the relationship are placed in a linear ordering.

The primary feature of an AR relationship is whether a person ranks above or below each other person. Those higher in rank hold greater authority, prestige and privileges, while subordinates are entitled to guidance and protection. Military ranks are a prototypical example of an AR relationship.<ref name=\"Fiske1992\" />\n\n'''Equality matching (EM)''' relationships are those characterized by various forms of one-for-one correspondence, such as turn taking, in-kind [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]], tit-for-tat retaliation, or eye-for-an-eye revenge. Parties in EM relationships are primarily concerned with ensuring the relationship is in a balanced state. Non-intimate acquaintances are a prototypical example.<ref name=\"Fiske1992\" />\n\n'''Market pricing (MP)''' relationships revolve around a model of proportionality where people attend to ratios and rates and relevant features are typically reduced to a single value or utility metric that allows the comparison (e.g., the price of a sale). Monetary transactions are a prototypical example of MP relationships.<ref name=\"Fiske1992\" />\n\nThe four relational models are argued to be innate, intrinsically motivated, and [[Cultural universal|culturally universal]] (though with culture-specific implementations).<ref name=\"Fiske2007\" /> These four elementary relationships can be combined to form more complex configurations of relationships called meta-relational models that entail or prohibit certain obligations, behaviors or relationships between [[Dyad (sociology)|dyads]] within the configuration (e.g., A being in a CS relationship with B prohibits B from being in a CS relationship with A's enemy, C).<ref name=\"Fiske2012\">{{cite journal |last1=Fiske |first1=Alan Page |title=Metarelational models: Configurations of social relationships |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |date=February 2012 |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=2\u201318 |doi=10.1002/ejsp.847 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to RMT, mis-matching of relational models is a common cause of interpersonal [[Conflict (process)|conflict]], given that different relational models will often imply different behaviors in the same situation. Taking two housemates sharing dishwashing as a simple example, Fiske suggests<ref name=\"Fiske2007\" /> that if housemate A assumes dishwashing is governed by a CS framework and housemate B assumes an EM framework, A will expect both of them to wash dishes whenever they can, and B will expect them to take turns. If A is busy and B is not, A will expect B to wash the dishes, but if B washed the dishes last, they'll assume it's A's turn, and conflict will ensue because of A and B's mis-matched relational models.\n\n===Correspondence with Stevens's levels of measurement===\nFiske proposed that the four discrete types of relationships correspond to Stevens's four [[levels of measurement]].<ref name=\"Fiske1992\" /> CS relationships resemble the categorical (nominal) scales of measurement in that all members of the relationship are equivalent. AR resembles an ordinal scale given that members of the relationship are placed in a linear ordering. EM relationships resemble interval measurement given that they are kept in balance by addition and subtraction. Finally, MP relationships resemble a ratio scale (whose origin corresponds, for example, to a price of zero) given that they involve proportions, multiplication and division and the distributive law.\n\n==Influence==\nThe two main, original publications on Relational Models Theory<ref name=\"Fiske1992\" /><ref name=\"Fiske1991\" /> have been cited over 4000 times.
