The family comprises Arqu\u00edmedes Puccio, the family patriarch; Epifan\u00eda Puccio, his wife; Alejandro, their eldest son and a star rugby player; Daniel \"Maguila\", their middle child, who'd left the country years ago and hadn't kept in touch; Silvia, their eldest daughter, a school teacher; Guillermo, their youngest son, who is still in high school; and Adriana, their youngest daughter, who is in middle school.\n\nAt the end of the [[Falklands War]] in 1982, Arqu\u00edmedes, who had been working for the state's intelligence services in operations to capture communist guerrilla fighters, becomes the owner of a small shop, a deli. In order to maintain his financial status, he decides to turn to crime and start kidnapping people for ransom, targeting wealthy families. Alejandro starts to collaborate with his father, by identifying potential hostages, taking advantage of his popularity among friends and acquaintances to not raise suspicion.\n\nThe first victim is Ricardo Manoukian, a friend and teammate of Alejandro's. Though the kidnapping is successful, Arqu\u00edmedes kills Ricardo anyway, to avoid any chances of being identified as the kidnapper. After discovering Ricardo has been killed, Alejandro has a bout of conscience, but his father convinces him to keep the secret by assuring him that if Ricardo had been left alive, he would have identified them as the culprits and gotten them all arrested.\n\nThe ransom improves the Puccios' economic situation and, by early 1983, they replace their family deli with a successful store selling sporting equipment. Alejandro meets a girl called Monica at the store, and, after a few dates, she becomes his girlfriend. Meanwhile, Gustavo Contenpomi, a friend of Arqu\u00edmedes' who is furious after being deceived in a business deal with entrepreneur Florencio Aulet, contacts the Puccios and suggests they make Florencio their next victim. Instead, Arqu\u00edmedes and his cronies kidnap Florencio's son, Eduardo; since he is one of Alejandro's friends, and thus he's easier to lure into a trap. The Aulets pay the ransom, but Eduardo has already been murdered, and his body buried in a shallow grave, on an empty construction lot.\n\nIn December 1983, after the [[Argentine general election, 1983|return to democracy in Argentina]], Arqu\u00edmedes goes to visit imprisoned military officer [[An\u00edbal Gordon]]\u2014who had participated with Puccio in the kidnapping of a businessman in 1973\u2014and asks for advice on how to continue with the Clan's activities in the new political landscape. Gordon advises him to lie low, since the military will have more difficulty protecting him now that they've lost control of the country, but Arqu\u00edmedes does not heed the warning.\n\nAlejandro accompanies his youngest brother, Guillermo, to the airport, since Guillermo\nis going abroad on a sports trip. At the gate, Guillermo confesses that he knows what Alejandro and their father had been up to, and says he will not be returning after the tour is over, since he is afraid of what will happen if the family's crimes are discovered. Before leaving, Guillermo begs his brother to get out while he still can. Listening to his brother's plea, Alejandro decides not to join his father in the next kidnapping: that of another businessman acquainted with the family, Emilio Naum. Due to Alejandro's absence, the plot fails, and Naum is murdered after refusing to stop his car when Arqu\u00edmedes and his goons begin the abduction. Angered, Arqu\u00edmedes returns home and beats Alejandro, blaming him for the failed kidnapping and accusing him of being ungrateful for all that Arqu\u00edmedes sacrificed to get him a cushy lifestyle.\n\nTo reconcile with his father, Alejandro travels abroad to convince his other brother, Maguila, to return to Argentina and join the Clan in their operations. Now, in 1985, the group kidnaps businesswoman N\u00e9lida Bollini Prado and keep her prisoner in their home's basement. However, things do not go according to plan: the ransom negotiations fail; Adriana hears the woman's screams coming from the basement and realizes what had been going on; and Arqu\u00edmedes gets a call from his former military superiors warning him that his stunts have garnered too much public attention, so he no longer has their protection.\n\nIn August 1985, when Arqu\u00edmedes and Maguila collect the ransom in a service station, they are arrested by the police, who then break into the Puccio house, free the kidnapped victim, and arrest the family, with the exception of Adriana. The case causes a frenzy among the media, who dub the family the \"Puccio Clan\".\n\nThe prosecuting attorney shows Arqu\u00edmedes the overwhelming evidence against him and tries to broker a deal: if Arqu\u00edmedes confesses to being the mastermind behind the kidnappings, his family will not be indicted as accomplices. Arqu\u00edmedes, however, insists that he'd been compelled to carry out the crimes by his military superiors and refuses to sacrifice himself for his family.\n\nWhile his rugby team and Monica believe in his innocence, Alejandro cannot withstand the pressure. After violently arguing with his father in their jail cell (during which Arqu\u00edmedes goads Alejandro to punch him, so Arqu\u00edmedes can falsely claim the guards beat him), Alejandro tries to commit suicide by throwing himself off the fifth floor of the Tribunal building while he is being taken to testify.\n\nThe film ends with a series of texts detailing the family's fate: \n*Alejandro survived his fall and was sentenced to life in prison. While serving his sentence, he tried to commit suicide four more times. Monica kept visiting him for years, until he asked her to stop doing so and instead move on with her life. Alejandro died [of pneumonia, aged 49<ref name = \"BBC\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-34106282|title=Puccio crime clan continues to intrigue Argentina|author=Caselli, Irene|date=3 September 2015|accessdate=3 September 2015|work=BBC News}}</ref>] in 2008, a few months after being released on probation. \n*Maguila never served his sentence, since he fled the country - presumably to Australia, Brazil, or New Zealand - before he could be tried.

The family comprises Arqu\u00edmedes Puccio, the family patriarch; Epifan\u00eda Puccio, his wife; Alejandro, their eldest son and a star rugby player; Daniel \"Maguila\", their middle child, who'd left the country years ago and hadn't kept in touch; Silvia, their eldest daughter, a school teacher; Guillermo, their youngest son, who is still in high school; and Adriana, their youngest daughter, who is in middle school.\n\nAt the end of the [[Falklands War]] in 1982, Arqu\u00edmedes, who had been working for the state's intelligence services in operations to capture communist guerrilla fighters, becomes the owner of a small shop, a deli. In order to maintain his financial status, he decides to turn to crime and start kidnapping people for ransom, targeting wealthy families. Alejandro starts to collaborate with his father, by identifying potential hostages, taking advantage of his popularity among friends and acquaintances to not raise suspicion.\n\nThe first victim is Ricardo Manoukian, a friend and teammate of Alejandro's. Though the kidnapping is successful, Arqu\u00edmedes kills Ricardo anyway, to avoid any chances of being identified as the kidnapper. After discovering Ricardo has been killed, Alejandro has a bout of conscience, but his father convinces him to keep the secret by assuring him that if Ricardo had been left alive, he would have identified them as the culprits and gotten them all arrested.\n\nThe ransom improves the Puccios' economic situation and, by early 1983, they replace their family deli with a successful store selling sporting equipment. Alejandro meets a girl called Monica at the store, and, after a few dates, she becomes his girlfriend. Meanwhile, Gustavo Contenpomi, a friend of Arqu\u00edmedes' who is furious after being deceived in a business deal with entrepreneur Florencio Aulet, contacts the Puccios and suggests they make Florencio their next victim. Instead, Arqu\u00edmedes and his cronies kidnap Florencio's son, Eduardo; since he is one of Alejandro's friends, and thus he's easier to lure into a trap. The Aulets pay the ransom, but Eduardo has already been murdered, and his body buried in a shallow grave, on an empty construction lot.\n\nIn December 1983, after the [[Argentine general election, 1983|return to democracy in Argentina]], Arqu\u00edmedes goes to visit imprisoned military officer [[An\u00edbal Gordon]]\u2014who had participated with Puccio in the kidnapping of a businessman in 1973\u2014and asks for advice on how to continue with the Clan's activities in the new political landscape. Gordon advises him to lie low, since the military will have more difficulty protecting him now that they've lost control of the country, but Arqu\u00edmedes does not heed the warning.\n\nAlejandro accompanies his youngest brother, Guillermo, to the airport, since Guillermo\nis going abroad on a sports trip. At the gate, Guillermo confesses that he knows what Alejandro and their father had been up to, and says he will not be returning after the tour is over, since he is afraid of what will happen if the family's crimes are discovered. Before leaving, Guillermo begs his brother to get out while he still can. Listening to his brother's plea, Alejandro decides not to join his father in the next kidnapping: that of another businessman acquainted with the family, Emilio Naum. Due to Alejandro's absence, the plot fails, and Naum is murdered after refusing to stop his car when Arqu\u00edmedes and his goons begin the abduction. Angered, Arqu\u00edmedes returns home and beats Alejandro, blaming him for the failed kidnapping and accusing him of being ungrateful for all that Arqu\u00edmedes sacrificed to get him a cushy lifestyle.\n\nTo reconcile with his father, Alejandro travels abroad to convince his other brother, Maguila, to return to Argentina and join the Clan in their operations. Now, in 1985, the group kidnaps businesswoman N\u00e9lida Bollini Prado and keep her prisoner in their home's basement. However, things do not go according to plan: the ransom negotiations fail; Adriana hears the woman's screams coming from the basement and realizes what had been going on; and Arqu\u00edmedes gets a call from his former military superiors warning him that his stunts have garnered too much public attention, so he no longer has their protection.\n\nIn August 1985, when Arqu\u00edmedes and Maguila collect the ransom in a service station, they are arrested by the police, who then break into the Puccio house, free the kidnapped victim, and arrest the family, with the exception of Adriana. The case causes a frenzy among the media, who dub the family the \"Puccio Clan\".\n\nThe prosecuting attorney shows Arqu\u00edmedes the overwhelming evidence against him and tries to broker a deal: if Arqu\u00edmedes confesses to being the mastermind behind the kidnappings, his family will not be indicted as accomplices. Arqu\u00edmedes, however, insists that he'd been compelled to carry out the crimes by his military superiors and refuses to sacrifice himself for his family.\n\nWhile his rugby team and Monica believe in his innocence, Alejandro cannot withstand the pressure. After violently arguing with his father in their jail cell (during which Arqu\u00edmedes goads Alejandro to punch him, so Arqu\u00edmedes can falsely claim the guards beat him), Alejandro tries to commit suicide by throwing himself off the fifth floor of the Tribunal building while he is being taken to testify.\n\nThe film ends with a series of texts detailing the family's fate: \n*Alejandro survived his fall and was sentenced to life in prison. While serving his sentence, he tried to commit suicide four more times. Monica kept visiting him for years, until he asked her to stop doing so and instead move on with her life. Alejandro died [of pneumonia, aged 49<ref name = \"BBC\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-34106282|title=Puccio crime clan continues to intrigue Argentina|author=Caselli, Irene|date=3 September 2015|accessdate=3 September 2015|work=BBC News}}</ref>] in 2008, a few months after being released on probation. \n*Maguila never served his sentence, since he fled the country - presumably to Australia, Brazil, or New Zealand - before he could be tried.

Originally much larger, today it covers just the [[Isle of Man]] and its adjacent islets. Today, the bishop's office is in [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]] and the [[Peel Cathedral|cathedral]] is in [[Peel, Isle of Man|Peel]]. The diocese is ''not'' generally called either \"Sodor diocese\" or \"Man diocese\".\n\n==Structure==\nThe diocese administers 40 churches, which are organised in 15 ecclesiastical parishes. Formerly there were 27 such parishes, but their number has been reduced by extensive pastoral reorganisation between 2012 and 2015.<ref>[http://www.gumbley.net/diocese.htm Isle of Man parishes and their churches and chapels]</ref> Each parish forms a separate [[Ecclesiastical benefice|benefice]], with the exception of two (Onchan; Lonan and Laxey) which are combined in a [[team ministry]] with a team rector and a team vicar.<ref>[http://www.tynwald.org.im/links/tls/SD/2012/2012-SD-0392.pdf Onchan, Lonan and Laxey Pastoral Scheme 2012 (SD 392/12)]</ref> The [[Archdeacon of Man]] is the incumbent (vicar) of the parish of St George and All Saints, Douglas. \n\nThe Cathedral Church of St German at Peel (informally styled Cathedral Isle of Man) is one of five churches in the parish of the West Coast, the incumbent (vicar) of which is ''ex officio'' [[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]] of the Cathedral.<ref>[https://www.legislation.gov.im/cms/images/LEGISLATION/PRINCIPAL/1895/1895-0001/ChurchAct1895_2.pdf Church Act 1895 (of Tynwald) section 4(2)]</ref>\n\nThe parishes are grouped into four \"Mission Partnerships\" (Eastern, Western, Southern and Northern) for purposes of mission and inter-parochial co-operation. Originally informal (from 2010), these mission partnerships became legal entities on 1 January 2013 under the Mission and Pastoral Measure (Isle of Man) 2012.<ref>[http://www.tynwald.org.im/links/tls/SD/2012/2012-SD-0654.pdf SD 654/12]</ref> They have completely replaced the traditional [[rural deanery]] structure, and the former deaneries and the office of rural dean have been legally abolished.

These include the school chaplain of [[King William's College]] (where there is an elegant Anglican chapel,<ref>Chapel outlined, with pictures, at the [https://www.kwc.im/chapelCollege website]{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.</ref> with scissor-braced roof with canopied stalls designed by James Cowle), and the hospital chaplain of the island's main [[Noble\u2019s Hospital]], where an interdenominational chapel is staffed by the Anglican chaplain together with two colleagues, one Roman Catholic, and one Free Church.<ref>Hospital Chapel and current Chaplains on the [https://www.gov.im/categories/health-and-wellbeing/hospitals-and-emergency-treatment/nobles-hospital/chapel-services/ Government website]</ref>\n\n==Early history==\n{{see also|Diocese of the Isles}}\n[[Image:Kingdom of Mann and the Isles-en.svg|thumb|left|The [[Kingdom of Mann and the Isles]] about the year 1100.

[[diocese]] of the [[Church of England]]. Originally much larger, today it covers just the [[Isle of Man]] and its adjacent islets. Today, the bishop's office is in [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]] and the [[Peel Cathedral|cathedral]] is in [[Peel, Isle of Man|Peel]]. The diocese is ''not'' generally called either \"Sodor diocese\" or \"Man diocese\".\n\n==Structure==\nThe diocese administers 40 churches, which are organised in 15 ecclesiastical parishes. Formerly there were 27 such parishes, but their number has been reduced by extensive pastoral reorganisation between 2012 and 2015.<ref>[http://www.gumbley.net/diocese.htm Isle of Man parishes and their churches and chapels]</ref> Each parish forms a separate [[Ecclesiastical benefice|benefice]], with the exception of two (Onchan; Lonan and Laxey) which are combined in a [[team ministry]] with a team rector and a team vicar.<ref>[http://www.tynwald.org.im/links/tls/SD/2012/2012-SD-0392.pdf Onchan, Lonan and Laxey Pastoral Scheme 2012 (SD 392/12)]</ref> The [[Archdeacon of Man]] is the incumbent (vicar) of the parish of St George and All Saints, Douglas. \n\nThe Cathedral Church of St German at Peel (informally styled Cathedral Isle of Man) is one of five churches in the parish of the West Coast, the incumbent (vicar) of which is ''ex officio'' [[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]] of the Cathedral.<ref>[https://www.legislation.gov.im/cms/images/LEGISLATION/PRINCIPAL/1895/1895-0001/ChurchAct1895_2.pdf Church Act 1895 (of Tynwald) section 4(2)]</ref>\n\nThe parishes are grouped into four \"Mission Partnerships\" (Eastern, Western, Southern and Northern) for purposes of mission and inter-parochial co-operation. Originally informal (from 2010), these mission partnerships became legal entities on 1 January 2013 under the Mission and Pastoral Measure (Isle of Man) 2012.<ref>[http://www.tynwald.org.im/links/tls/SD/2012/2012-SD-0654.pdf SD 654/12]</ref> They have completely replaced the traditional [[rural deanery]] structure, and the former deaneries and the office of rural dean have been legally abolished.

These include the school chaplain of [[King William's College]] (where there is an elegant Anglican chapel,<ref>Chapel outlined, with pictures, at the [https://www.kwc.im/chapelCollege website]{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.</ref> with scissor-braced roof with canopied stalls designed by James Cowle), and the hospital chaplain of the island's main [[Noble\u2019s Hospital]], where an interdenominational chapel is staffed by the Anglican chaplain together with two colleagues, one Roman Catholic, and one Free Church.<ref>Hospital Chapel and current Chaplains on the [https://www.gov.im/categories/health-and-wellbeing/hospitals-and-emergency-treatment/nobles-hospital/chapel-services/ Government website]</ref>\n\n==Early history==\n{{see also|Diocese of the Isles}}\n[[Image:Kingdom of Mann and the Isles-en.svg|thumb|left|The [[Kingdom of Mann and the Isles]] about the year 1100.

{"title_page": "Thomas Tomkins", "text_new": "{{short description|Welsh composer}}\n{{other people||Thomas Tomkins (disambiguation)}}\n{{EngvarB|date=August 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2014}}\n'''Thomas Tomkins''' (1572 \u2013 9 June 1656) was a Welsh-born composer of the late [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] and early [[Stuart dynasty|Stuart]] period. In addition to being one of the prominent members of the [[English Madrigal School]], he was a skilled composer of keyboard and [[consort of instruments|consort]] music, and the last member of the English [[virginalist]] school.\n\n==Life==\nTomkins was born in [[St David's]] in [[Pembrokeshire]] in 1572. His father, also Thomas, who had moved there in 1565 from the family home of [[Lostwithiel]] in Cornwall,<ref>Boden 2005, p. 7</ref> was a [[Lay clerk|vicar choral]] of [[St David's Cathedral]] and organist there. Three of Thomas junior's half-brothers, John, Giles and Robert, also became eminent musicians, but none quite attained the fame of Thomas. By 1594, but possibly as early as 1586, Thomas and his family had moved to [[Gloucester]], where his father was employed as a minor canon at the [[Gloucester Cathedral|cathedral]]. Thomas almost certainly studied under [[William Byrd]] for a time, for one of his songs<ref>''Too much I once lamented'' (1622)</ref> bears the inscription: ''To my ancient, and much reverenced Master, William Byrd'', and it may have been at this period of his career, since Byrd leased property at Longney, near Gloucester. Although documentary proof is lacking, it is also possible that Byrd was instrumental in finding young Thomas a place as chorister in the [[Chapel Royal]].<ref>Boden 2005, p. 42</ref> In any case, all former Chapel Royal choristers were required to be found a place at university, and in 1607 Tomkins was admitted to the degree of B.Mus. as a member of [[Magdalen College, Oxford]].\n\n[[File:Worcester cathedral.jpg|thumb|200px|Worcester Cathedral]]\nBut already in 1596 he had been appointed Organist at [[Worcester Cathedral]]. The next year he married Alice Patrick, a widow nine years his senior, whose husband Nathaniel, who died in 1595, had been Tomkins' predecessor at Worcester. Thomas's only son, [[Nathaniel Tomkins|Nathaniel]], was born in Worcester in 1599, where he was to spend the rest of his life and become a respected musician.\n\nTomkins was acquainted with [[Thomas Morley]], also a pupil of Byrd's, for his signed copy of Morley's publication ''Plaine and Easie Introduction to Practicall Musicke'' (1597) has been preserved, together with Thomas's many annotations;<ref>Magdalen College Library, Oxford</ref> and in 1601 Morley included one of Tomkins' madrigals in his important collection ''[[The Triumphs of Oriana]]''.\n\nIn 1612 Tomkins oversaw the construction in Worcester cathedral of a magnificent new organ by [[Thomas Dallam]], the foremost organ-builder of the day. He continued writing verse anthems, and his collection of 28 madrigals, the ''Songs of 3, 4, 5 and 6 parts'' was finally published in 1622 with a dedicatory poem by his half-brother John Tomkins (circa 1587\u20131638), now organist of [[King's College, Cambridge]] (later of [[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]] and of the Chapel Royal), with whom Thomas maintained an intimate and loving relationship.\n\nProbably by about 1603 Thomas was appointed a Gentleman Extraordinary of the Chapel Royal. This was an honorary post, but in 1621 he became a Gentleman Ordinary and organist under his friend and senior organist, [[Orlando Gibbons]]. The duties connected with this post included regular journeys between Worcester and London, which Tomkins performed until about 1639.<ref>Boden 2005 p. 165</ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120220083627/http://www.thomastomkins.org.uk/page06_biography.htm#Tomkins]\n\nOn [[James I of England|James I's]] death in March 1625 Tomkins, with other Gentlemen of the Chapel Royal, was required to attend to both the music for James's funeral and that for the [[coronation]] of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. These monumental tasks proved too much for Gibbons, who died of a stroke in [[Canterbury]], where Charles was supposed to meet his future bride, [[Henrietta Maria of France]], placing an even greater strain on Tomkins. Because of [[Plague (disease)|plague]], the coronation was luckily postponed until February 1626, giving Tomkins time to compose most of the eight anthems sung at the ceremony.<ref>Boden 2005, p. 127</ref>\n\nIn 1628 Tomkins was named \"Composer of [the King's] Music in ordinary\" at an annual salary of \u00a340, succeeding [[Alfonso Ferrabosco the younger]] who died in March that year. But this prestigious post, the highest honour available to an English musician, was quickly revoked on the grounds that it had been promised to Ferrabosco's son. This shabby treatment was to be only the first of a series of adversities that overtook the composer for the last fourteen years of his life. He continued, however, to perform his dual duties at Worcester and London until 1639.\n\nTomkins' devoted wife Alice died in 1642, the year [[English Civil War#The First English Civil War|civil war]] broke out. Worcester was one of the first casualties: the cathedral was desecrated, and Tomkins' organ badly damaged by the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]]. The following year Tomkins' house near the cathedral suffered a direct hit by [[cannon]] shot, making it uninhabitable for a long period, and destroying most of his household goods and probably a number of his musical [[manuscript]]s. About this time Tomkins married his second wife Martha Browne, widow of a Worcester Cathedral [[lay clerk]].\n\nFurther conflict and a siege in 1646 caused untold damage to the city. With the choir disbanded and the cathedral closed, Tomkins turned his genius to the composition of some of his finest keyboard and consort music; in 1647, he wrote a belated ''tombeau'' or tribute to [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford]], and a further one to the memory of [[William Laud]], Archbishop of Canterbury, both of them beheaded in the 1640s, and both admired by Tomkins. Charles I was executed in 1649, and a few days later Tomkins, always a royalist, composed his superb ''Sad Pavan: for these distracted times''. His second wife Martha died around 1653, and deprived of his living, Tomkins, now 81, was in serious financial difficulties. In 1654 his son Nathaniel married Isabella Folliott, a wealthy widow, and Thomas went to live with them in [[Martin Hussingtree]], some four miles from Worcester. He expressed his gratitude by composing his ''Galliard, The Lady Folliot's'' in her honour. Two years later he died and was buried in the churchyard of the [[Church of St Michael and All Angels, Martin Hussingtree|Church of St Michael and All Angels]] in Martin Hussingtree on 9 June 1656.\n\n==Works==\nTomkins wrote and published [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]s\u2014amongst which ''The Fauns and Satyrs Tripping'', included in Morley's ''The Triumphs of Oriana'' (1601); ''Songs of 3,4,5 and 6 parts'' (1622); 76 pieces of keyboard (organ, virginal, harpsichord) music, [[consort of instruments|consort]] music, [[anthem]]s, and [[Service (music)|liturgical music]].  Stylistically he was extremely conservative, even anachronistic: he seems to have completely ignored the rising [[Baroque music|Baroque]] practice around him, with its Italian-inspired idioms, and he also avoided writing in most of the popular forms of the time, such as the [[lute song]], or [[Air (music)|ayre]]. His [[polyphony|polyphonic]] language, even in the fourth decade of the 17th century, was frankly that of the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]]. Some of his madrigals are extremely expressive, with text-painting and [[chromaticism]] worthy of Italian madrigalists such as [[Luca Marenzio|Marenzio]] or [[Luzzasco Luzzaschi|Luzzaschi]].\n\nHe was also a prolific composer of both full and verse anthems, writing more than almost any other English composer of the 17th century\u2014surpassed (putatively) only by [[William Child]]\u2014and several of his works for the church were contemporaneously copied for use elsewhere. The survival of his music was ensured by the posthumous publication, overseen by his son Nathaniel, of ''Musica Deo Sacra et Ecclesiae Anglicanae; or Music dedicated to the Honor and Service of God, and to the Use of Cathedral and other Churches of England'' (William Godbid, London: 1668); ''Musica Deo Sacra'' contains five services, five psalm tunes, the Preces and two proper psalms, and ninety-four anthems, and was published as a five-volume set\u2014one volume each for Medius; Contratenor; Tenor; Bassus, and the Pars Organica.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Sources==\n* Stephen D.
