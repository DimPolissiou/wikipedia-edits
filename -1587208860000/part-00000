Before, it was just called red soda or nam dang (\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e41\u0e14\u0e07 - literally means red water). Red Fanta was reportedly the preferred drink of the then-King of Thailand [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]]. Glasses and open bottles of red Fanta are often seen as offerings on the small altars displayed in most Thai homes and shops. They supposedly  represent blood offerings in Thai [[animistic]] beliefs.\n* Green Soda (cream soda) - This flavour is not listed on the packaging. It is just called green soda or {{transl|tha|nam quiew}} (\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e40\u0e02\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27 - literally means green water).

2010)\n* Red Soda (strawberry) - This flavour is now listed on the packaging. Before, it was just called red soda or nam dang (\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e41\u0e14\u0e07 - literally means red water). Red Fanta was reportedly the preferred drink of the then-King of Thailand [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]]. Glasses and open bottles of red Fanta are often seen as offerings on the small altars displayed in most Thai homes and shops. They supposedly  represent blood offerings in Thai [[animistic]] beliefs.\n* Green Soda (cream soda) - This flavour is not listed on the packaging. It is just called green soda or {{transl|tha|nam quiew}} (\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e40\u0e02\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27 - literally means green water).

The French Navy has shown with the frigate Forbin its capacity to destroy a supersonic missile ( 3,000  km / h ) maneuvering ( SS-N-22 , AS-17 , BrahMos ) and at an altitude of less than 5 meters above water by shooting down a GQM-163 Coyote.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.defense.gouv.fr/marine/a-la-une/interception-d-une-cible-supersonique-evoluant-au-ras-de-l-eau |title=Interception d\u2019une cible supersonique \u00e9voluant au ras de l\u2019eau |publisher=www.defense.gouv.fr |date=5 April 2012 |accessdate=2020-04-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marianne.net/blogsecretdefense/Aster-30-une-interception-de-tres-haute-technicite-reussie_a569.html |title=Les billets de blogs |language={{in lang|fr}} |publisher=Marianne |date= |accessdate=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n\n===Missile Exocet MM40 Block 3C===\nThe Forbin embarks eight sea-sea Exocet missiles installed on the upper deck amidships.
