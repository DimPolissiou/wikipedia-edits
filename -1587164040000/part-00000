The lymphomyeloid tissues develop from epithelial or [[mesenchymal]] anlages that are full of haematopoetic cells.<ref>Fellah JS, Jaffredo T, Dunon D (2008). \u201cDevelopment of the Avian Immune System.\u201d Avian Immunology. 4:51-66.</ref>  The bursa fabricus, [[thymus]], [[spleen]] and [[lymph nodes]] all develop when haematopoetic stem cells enter the bursal or thymic anlages and become competent B and T cells.<ref name=\"auto\">Masteller EL, Pharr GT, Funk PE, Thompson CB (1997). \u201cAvian B cell development.\u201d Int. Rev. Immunol. 15(3-4): 185-206.</ref>\nThe avian immune system is divided into two types of immunity, the [[Innate immune system|innate]] and [[Adaptive immune system|adaptive]] ones. The innate immune system includes physical and chemical barriers, [[blood proteins]] and [[phagocytic cells]]. In addition, [[Complement system|complement serum proteins]], which are a part of the innate immune system, work with antibodies to lyse target cell. Adaptive immunity, on the other hand, kicks in when the innate system fails to stop invading pathogens. The adaptive response includes targeted recognition of specific molecular features on the surface of the pathogen. Birds, like other animals, have [[B cells]], [[T cells]] and [[humoral immunity]] as part of their adaptive response.<ref>Jenkins KA, Bean AG, Lowenthal JW (2007). \u201cAvian genomics and the innate immune response to viruses.\u201d Cytogenet. Genome Res. 117(1-4):207-12.</ref>\n\n== Structure ==\n\nVarious bird organs function to differentiate avian immune cells: the [[thymus]], [[Bursa of Fabricius]] and [[bone marrow]] are primary avian [[lymphoid organs]] whereas the [[spleen]], [[Mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue|mucosal associated lymphoid tissues]] (MALT), [[germinal centers]], and diffuse lymphoid tissues are secondary lymphoid organs. Birds do not have lymph nodes. The thymus, where T cells develop, is located in the neck of birds. The Bursa of Fabricius is an organ that is unique to birds and is the only site for B cell differentiation and maturation. Located in the rump of birds, this organ is full of stem cells and very active in young birds but atrophies after six months.<ref name=\"auto1\">Ratcliffe MJH, Lisilla O, Pink JRL, Vainio O (2005). \u201cAvian B cell precursors: surface immunoglobulin expression is an early, possibly bursa-independent event.\u201d Eur. J. Immunol. 16(2): 129-133.</ref>\nBronchial associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) and [[gut associated lymphoid tissue]] (GALT) are found along the [[bronchus]] and [[intestines]], respectively.<ref name=\"auto\"/> In the avian respiratory system, there are heterophils, which are an important part of bird immunity. Within the head, there is head associated lymphoid tissues (HALT) that contain the [[Harderian gland]], [[lacrimal gland]] and other structures in the [[larynx]] or [[nasopharynx]].<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The [[Harderian gland]] is located behind the eyeballs and is the major component of HALT. It contains a large number of plasma cells and is the main secretory body of [[antibodies]].<ref>Mobini B (2012). \u201cHistological and histochemical studies on the Harderian gland in native chickens.\u201d Veterinarni Medicina. 57(8):404-409.</ref>\nAlongside these primary and secondary lymphoid organs, there is also the lymphatic circulatory system of vessels and capillaries that communicate with the blood supply and transport the [[lymph fluid]] throughout the bird's body.\n\n=== T cells ===\n\nThe [[antigen recognition]] by T cells is a remarkable process dependent on the [[T cell receptor]] (TCR). The TCR is randomly generated and thus has extensive diversity in the peptides-[[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC]] complexes it can recognize. Using [[monoclonal]] antibodies that are specific for chicken T cell surface antigens, the development of T cells in birds is studied.<ref name=\"auto2\">Chen CL, Bucy RP, Cooper MD (1990). \u201cT cell differentiation in birds.\u201d Semin Immunol. 2(1):79-86.</ref> The differentiation pathways, functional processes and molecules of T cells are highly conserved in birds. However, there are some novel features of T cells that are unique to birds. These include a new lineage of cytoplasmic CD3+ lymphoid cells (TCR0 cells) and a T cell sublineage that expresses a different receptor isotypes (TCR3) generated exclusively in the thymus.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\nHomologues of the mammalian gamma, delta and alpha beta TCR (TCR1 and TCR2) are found in birds. However, a third TCR, called TCR3, has been found in avian T cell populations that lack both TCR1 and TCR2. These were found on all CD3+ T cells and were either [[CD4+]] or [[CD8+]]. This subset of T cells, as others, develops in the thymus and gets seeded throughout the body with the exception of the intestines.<ref>Char D, Sanchez P, Chen CL, Bucy RP, Cooper MD (1990). \u201cA third sublineage of avian T cells can be identified with a T cell receptor-3-specific antibody.\u201d J. Immunol. 145(11):3547-3555.</ref>\nThe pattern of [[Co-stimulatory|accessory molecules]] expressed by avian T cells resembles mammalian [[T cells|\u03b1/\u03b2 T cells]]. High CD8 expression precedes the dual expression of CD4 and CD8 but following [[clonal selection]] and expansion, avian T cells cease to express either CD4 or CD8.<ref>Viertlboeck B, G\u00f6bel TWF (2008). \u201cAvian T cells: antigen recognition and lineages.\u201d Avian Immunol. 6:91-105.</ref>\n\n=== B cells ===\n\nThe central organ for B cell development in birds is the [[Bursa of Fabricius]]. The function of the bursa was discovered when it was surgically removed from neonatal chicks and this led to an impaired antibody response to ''[[Salmonella typhimurium]]''. It is now clear that the bursa is the primary site of B cell lymphopoeisis and that avian B cell development has some unique properties compared to human or mouse models.<ref>Kaiser P, Rothwell L, Galyov EE, Barrow PA, Burnside J, Wigley P (2000). \u201cDifferential cytokine expression in avian cells response to invasion by Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis and Salmonella gallinarium.\u201d Microbiol. 146(12):3217-3226.</ref>\nAlmost all the B cell progenitors in the bursa of 4-day-old chickens express [[IgM]] on their cell surface. Studies have shown that B cells of 4 \u2013 8 week old birds are derived from 2 \u2013 4 allotypically committed precursor cells in each follicle. Bursal follicles are colonized by 2-5 pre-bursal stem cells and these undergo extensive proliferation after they are committed to an allotype. Expression of IgM is controlled by a biological clock as opposed to the bursal microenvironment. Moreover, the source of all B cells in adult birds was determined to be a population of self-renewing [[B cells|sIg+ B cells]].<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n== Development ==\n\nIn studying the development of the avian immune system, the [[embryo]] offers several advantages such as the availability of many embryos at precise stages of development and distinct B and T cell systems. Each population differentiates from a primary lymphoid organ: T cells in the thymus and B cells in the [[Bursa of Fabricius]]. Research has found that [[early feeding]] of hydrated nutritional supplements in chickens heavily affects the immune system development. This is often measured by weight of the [[Bursa of Fabricius]], improved resistance to disease and earlier appearance of [[IgA]].<ref>Dibner JJ, Knight CD, Kitchell ML, Atwell CA, Downs AC, Ivey EJ (1998). \u201cEarly feeding and development of the immune system in neonatal poultry.\u201d J. Appl. Poult. Res. 7(4):425-436.</ref>\nUnlike other animals, newly hatched chicks are born with an incomplete immune system. Here, the [[amniotic fluid]] and yolk of the egg contain the maternal immunity to be passed on to the hatchling. Swallowing of the amniotic fluid during hatching confers immunity to these chicks until their immune system develops fully. In the first six weeks of the bird's life, continuous gene conversion in the bursa completes the immune system. Upon hatch, birds do not have a library of genetic information for B cells to use for antibody production. Instead, B cells mature in the bursa during the first six weeks and then go on to seed other organs of the immune system. As a result, birds are highly susceptible to pathogens in the first few weeks after hatching. Research found that T cells from mature chickens proliferated extensively and produced high levels of [[Interleukin 2|IL-2]] and other [[cytokines]]. On the other hand, T cells from 24 hour-old chickens failed to proliferate and could not secrete cytokines.<ref name=\"auto3\">Wallach M, Halabi A, Pillemer G, Sar-Shalom O, Mencher D, Gilad M, Bendheim U, Danforth HD, Augustine PC (1992). \u201cMaternal immunization with gametocyte antigens as a means of providing protective immunity against Eimeria maxima in chickens.\u201d Infect. Immunol. 60(5):2036-2039.</ref><ref name=\"auto4\">Davison F, Kaspers B, Schat KA (2008). \u201cAvian Immunology.\u201d {{ISBN|978-0-12-370634-8}}</ref>\n[[Gene conversion]] within the bursa leads to the development of antibodies that are diverse in their recognition ability.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> Mammalian V, D and J gene segments allow for many combinations and therefore, yield a vast repertoire of antibodies. However, birds have only a single functional copy of the V<sub>L</sub> and J<sub>L</sub> genes for the Ig [[Immunoglobulin light chain|light chain]] and a single functional copy of the V<sub>H</sub> and J<sub>H</sub> heavy chain genes. This results in a low diversity from gene rearrangements of Ig [[Immunoglobulin heavy chain|heavy]] and [[Immunoglobulin light chain|light chain]]s. However, clusters of [[pseudogenes]] upstream of the heavy and light gene Ig loci take part in somatic gene conversion \u2013 a process where [[pseudogenes]] replace the V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> genes.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> This diversifies the repertoire of bird antibodies.\n\n== Avian innate immune system ==\n\nLittle is known about the [[innate immune system]] of birds. Most research has been focused on chickens due to the increased threat of [[viral diseases]] within the poultry population. The innate immune response is known to be essential for viral infection and as a result, the publication of the full chicken genome sequence is a source for identifying possible [[adjuvants]] and immunity genes.\n\n== Unique features ==\n\n=== Transfer of maternal immunity ===\n\nAvian immunity begins to develop at the end of embryonic life but the majority of early immunity is obtained via passive acquisition of maternal antibodies. Such antibodies are found within the [[egg]] when it is laid and originated from the yolk of the egg. Kramer and Cho have shown [[immunoglobulins]] in both the egg white and in the embryo.<ref>Kramer TT, Cho HC (1970). \u201cTransfer of immunoglobluins and antibodies in the hen\u2019s egg.\u201d Immunol. 19(1): 157\u2013167.</ref> Maternal [[IgA]] and [[IgM]] get transferred to the egg as it passes down the oviduct.\n\n=== TTP ===\n\nAn important element of immune systems in various animals is the protein tristetraprolin (TTP). This plays a key [[anti-inflammatory]] role by regulating [[TNF\u03b1]]. Mouse models with TTP knockouts result in chronic and often deadly inflammation when exposed to small amounts of pathogen-associated molecular patterns ([[PAMPs]]). However, TTP and its homologs is altogether absent from birds. Avian genomes have been searched for similar sequences to TTP and bird cell lines have been exposed to foreign proteins and bacteria molecules known to stimulate TTP production but no evidence of TTP has been found. The missing protein poses a very different immune response regulation in birds as opposed to mammals, reptiles and amphibians.<ref>Lai WS, Stumpo DJ, Kennington EA, Burkholder AB, Ward JM, Fargo DL, Blackshear PJ (2013). \u201cLife without TTP: Apparent absence of an important anti-inflammatory protein in birds.\u201d AJP.</ref>\n\n=== Organs ===\n\nThe avian T cell population, like that of mammals develops in the [[thymus]]. However, the [[thymus]] in birds is a paired organ composed of many separated lobes of ovoid tissue in the neck. These are close to the [[vagus nerve]] and the [[jugular vein]] and are most active in young hatchlings. It is postulated that this organ is linked to erythropoeitic function and closely associated with the avian breeding cycle.<ref name=\"auto5\">Ciriaco E, Pi\u00f1era PP, Diaz-Esnal B, Laura R (2003). \u201cAge-related changes in the avian primary lymphoid organs (thymus and bursa of Fabricius.\u201d Microsc. Res. Tech. 62(6):482-7.</ref> The removal of the thymic lobes has been correlated to birds rejecting allogeneic skingrafts and delayed skin reactions.\n\nThe [[Bursa of Fabricius|bursa of Fabricus]] is a globular or spherical lymphoepithelial organ. The inner surface is littered with folds, which resemble [[Peyer's patch]]es in mammals and obscure the lumen. Its growth is correlated with the rapid body growth. It regresses and disappears about the time of sexual maturity. The bursa, as studied through [[bursectomy]] at different developmental stages, indicates sequential development of [[IgG]], [[IgM]] and [[IgA]].<ref name=\"auto5\"/> The secondary (peripheral) lymphoid tissue also includes unique lymphoid nodules in the digestive tract and solitary nodules scattered throughout the body, a characteristic of avian species. Meanwhile, lymph nodes only occur in some water, marsh and shore species.<ref>Lillehoj HS, Trout JM (1996). \u201cAvian gut-associated lymphoid tissues and intestinal immune responses to Eimeria parasites.\u201d Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 9(3): 349\u2013360.</ref>\n\n== Diseases ==\n\nControl of infectious disease is essential for the production of healthy poultry flocks. [[Vaccination]] programs have been used extensively in North American factory farming methods to induce avian immune responses against bird pathogens. These include Marek's Disease, Duck Hepatitis Virus, Chicken Anemia Virus, [[Turkeypox]], [[Fowlpox]] and others.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> Bird immunity is reliant on a complex network of cell types and soluble factors that must properly function in order for large commercial poultry flocks to survive.\n\n[[Infectious bursal disease virus]] and chicken anemia are ubiquitous and have increased interest in combatting avian pathogens. [[Parasites]] of birds are another emerging concern since the crowded nature of poultry farms facilitates easy spreading.\n\n=== Immunosuppressive diseases ===\n\nSeveral [[immunosuppressive]] agents are encountered by birds including [[viruses]], [[bacteria]], [[parasites]], [[toxins]], [[mycotoxins]], chemicals and drugs. The most common immunosuppressive viruses are [[Infectious bursal disease virus|Infectious Bursal Disease Virus]] (IBDV), [[Avian leukosis virus|Avian Leukosis]], Marek's Disease (MD) and Hemorrhagic Enteritis Virus (HEV). Concurrent immunosuppressive infections are an emerging concern in the poultry industry whereby early infection with IBDV causes the MD virus to come out of dormancy and contribute to active disease. New studies show that stress is the number one cause of [[immunosuppression]] in birds.<ref>Yegani M et al. (2005) \u201cImmunosuppression threat\u201d World Poultry. 21(2):18-22.</ref> Stressors leave birds more susceptible to infectious agents and therefore, new poultry management guidelines need to be endorsed.\n\n=== Birds as vectors ===\n\nThe migratory nature of birds poses a distinct danger for the spreading of diseases. Without being affected by the infectious agent, birds can act as vectors in spreading [[psittacosis]], [[salmonellosis]], [[campylobacteriosis]], [[mycobacteriosis]], [[avian influenza]], [[giardiasis]] and [[cryptosporidiosis]]. These [[zoonotic diseases]] can be transmitted to humans.\nIn the case of [[avian influenza]] ([[H5N1]] strain), water birds can be infected with the low pathogenic form or the high pathogenic form. The former induces mild symptoms such as a drop in egg production, ruffled feathers and mild effects on the avian respiratory tract. The highly pathogenic form spreads much more rapidly and can infect multiple tissues and organs. Massive internal bleeding and [[hemorrhaging]] follow and this has earned the H5N1 virus the moniker \u201cchicken ebola.\u201d<ref>Beach RH, Poulos C, Pattanayak SK (2007). \u201cFarm economics of bird flu.\u201d Can. J. Agr. Eco. 55(4):471-483.</ref>\n\n=== Tumours ===\n\nMuch like other animals, birds are prone to cancers and [[tumours]]. This refers to the abnormal growth of cells in a tissue or organ that can be either [[malignant]] or [[benign]]. Internal cancers can occur in the [[kidneys]], [[liver]], [[stomach]], [[ovary]], [[muscles]] or [[bone]]. [[Squamous cell carcinoma]] is a form of skin cancer that birds obtain, manifesting on the wing tips, toes, and around the beak and eyes. The cause is believed to be high exposure to [[UV rays]]. Additionally, a cancer of the connective tissue, known as [[fibrosarcoma]], is often seen in the leg or wing. This occurs in many [[parrot]] species, [[cockatiels]], [[macaws]] and [[budgerigars]]. Treatment options include [[amputation]] and [[surgery]].<ref>Reavill DR (2004). \u201cTumors of pet birds.\u201d Veterinary Clinics of North America. 7(3): 537-560.</ref>\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Bird health]]\n", "text_old": "The '''avian immune system''' is the system of biological structures and cellular processes that protects [[birds]] from disease.\n\nThe avian [[immune system]] resembles that of [[mammals]] since both evolved from a common reptilian ancestor and have inherited many commonalities.<ref>Seto F (1981). \u201cEarly development of the avian immune system\u201d Poult.

However, the [[thymus]] in birds is a paired organ composed of many separated lobes of ovoid tissue in the neck. These are close to the [[vagus nerve]] and the [[jugular vein]] and are most active in young hatchlings. It is postulated that this organ is linked to erythropoeitic function and closely associated with the avian breeding cycle.<ref name=\"auto5\">Ciriaco E, Pi\u00f1era PP, Diaz-Esnal B, Laura R (2003). \u201cAge-related changes in the avian primary lymphoid organs (thymus and bursa of Fabricius.\u201d Microsc. Res. Tech. 62(6):482-7.</ref> The removal of the thymic lobes has been correlated to birds rejecting allogeneic skingrafts and delayed skin reactions.\n\nThe [[Bursa of Fabricius|bursa of Fabricus]] is a globular or spherical lymphoepithelial organ. The inner surface is littered with folds, which resemble [[Peyer's patch]]es in mammals and obscure the lumen. Its growth is correlated with the rapid body growth. It regresses and disappears about the time of sexual maturity. The bursa, as studied through [[bursectomy]] at different developmental stages, indicates sequential development of [[IgG]], [[IgM]] and [[IgA]].<ref name=\"auto5\"/> The secondary (peripheral) lymphoid tissue also includes unique lymphoid nodules in the digestive tract and solitary nodules scattered throughout the body, a characteristic of avian species. Meanwhile, lymph nodes only occur in some water, marsh and shore species.<ref>Lillehoj HS, Trout JM (1996). \u201cAvian gut-associated lymphoid tissues and intestinal immune responses to Eimeria parasites.\u201d Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 9(3): 349\u2013360.</ref>\n\n== Diseases ==\n\nControl of infectious disease is essential for the production of healthy poultry flocks. [[Vaccination]] programs have been used extensively in North American factory farming methods to induce avian immune responses against bird pathogens. These include Marek's Disease, Duck Hepatitis Virus, Chicken Anemia Virus, [[Turkeypox]], [[Fowlpox]] and others.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> Bird immunity is reliant on a complex network of cell types and soluble factors that must properly function in order for large commercial poultry flocks to survive.\n\n[[Infectious bursal disease virus]] and chicken anemia are ubiquitous and have increased interest in combatting avian pathogens. [[Parasites]] of birds are another emerging concern since the crowded nature of poultry farms facilitates easy spreading.\n\n=== Immunosuppressive diseases ===\n\nSeveral [[immunosuppressive]] agents are encountered by birds including [[viruses]], [[bacteria]], [[parasites]], [[toxins]], [[mycotoxins]], chemicals and drugs. The most common immunosuppressive viruses are [[Infectious bursal disease virus|Infectious Bursal Disease Virus]] (IBDV), [[Avian leukosis virus|Avian Leukosis]], Marek's Disease (MD) and Hemorrhagic Enteritis Virus (HEV). Concurrent immunosuppressive infections are an emerging concern in the poultry industry whereby early infection with IBDV causes the MD virus to come out of dormancy and contribute to active disease. New studies show that stress is the number one cause of [[immunosuppression]] in birds.<ref>Yegani M et al. (2005) \u201cImmunosuppression threat\u201d World Poultry. 21(2):18-22.</ref> Stressors leave birds more susceptible to infectious agents and therefore, new poultry management guidelines need to be endorsed.\n\n=== Birds as vectors ===\n\nThe migratory nature of birds poses a distinct danger for the spreading of diseases. Without being affected by the infectious agent, birds can act as vectors in spreading [[psittacosis]], [[salmonellosis]], [[campylobacteriosis]], [[mycobacteriosis]], [[avian influenza]], [[giardiasis]] and [[cryptosporidiosis]]. These [[zoonotic diseases]] can be transmitted to humans.\nIn the case of [[avian influenza]] ([[H5N1]] strain), water birds can be infected with the low pathogenic form or the high pathogenic form. The former induces mild symptoms such as a drop in egg production, ruffled feathers and mild effects on the avian respiratory tract. The highly pathogenic form spreads much more rapidly and can infect multiple tissues and organs. Massive internal bleeding and [[hemorrhaging]] follow and this has earned the H5N1 virus the moniker \u201cchicken ebola.\u201d<ref>Beach RH, Poulos C, Pattanayak SK (2007). \u201cFarm economics of bird flu.\u201d Can. J. Agr. Eco. 55(4):471-483.</ref>\n\n=== Tumours ===\n\nMuch like other animals, birds are prone to cancers and [[tumours]]. This refers to the abnormal growth of cells in a tissue or organ that can be either [[malignant]] or [[benign]]. Internal cancers can occur in the [[kidneys]], [[liver]], [[stomach]], [[ovary]], [[muscles]] or [[bone]]. [[Squamous cell carcinoma]] is a form of skin cancer that birds obtain, manifesting on the wing tips, toes, and around the beak and eyes. The cause is believed to be high exposure to [[UV rays]]. Additionally, a cancer of the connective tissue, known as [[fibrosarcoma]], is often seen in the leg or wing. This occurs in many [[parrot]] species, [[cockatiels]], [[macaws]] and [[budgerigars]]. Treatment options include [[amputation]] and [[surgery]].<ref>Reavill DR (2004). \u201cTumors of pet birds.\u201d Veterinary Clinics of North America. 7(3): 537-560.</ref>\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Bird health]]\n", "name_user": "Kaltenmeyer", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_immune_system"}
