It was released through Early Access on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS|Mac OS X]] on December 13, 2013, and for Linux on November 22, 2014. Versions for the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] were released in 2016 through [[Telltale Games|Telltale Publishing]].\n\n==Story==\nThe game's events happen during aftermath of a nuclear [[Third World War]] that destroyed an extremely large part of the world, except for some areas such as the fictional county of Navezgane, [[The North Pole]]. The player is a survivor of the war who must survive by finding shelter, food and water, as well as scavenging supplies to fend off the numerous zombies (hinted to be the consequence of nuclear fallout) that populate Navezgane. Though there is no real objective except surviving at this moment, the developers hinted at a possible storyline that will be added in future updates.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Gameplay==\nIn \u201c7 Days to Die\u201d, the player spawns into a randomly-generated world or the preset world of Navezgane, Arizona, with the objective of surviving for as long as possible against the elements and the zombie hordes. As a survival game, the player character is in constant need of water and food for sustenance, as well as being vulnerable to injury and illness. The game is voxel-based (similar in some aspects to ''[[Minecraft]]''), allowing for simple building, and destruction of objects in a physics-simulated environment (for example, building a structure with no support such as pillars and walls can lead to its collapse).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/7-days-to-die-adds-crafting-and-voxels-to-your-post-apocalypse/|title=7 Days to Die adds crafting and voxels to your post-apocalyptic sandbox|first=Perry|last=Vandell|website=[[PC Gamer]]|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=May 29, 2013|accessdate=April 11, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-07-26-7-days-to-die-combines-a-voxel-based-sandbox-with-zombies|title=7 Days to Die combines a voxel-based sandbox with zombies|first=Jeffery|last=Matulef|website=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|date=August 16, 2016|accessdate=April 11, 2016}}</ref> Objects in the world degrade through use, so the player has to search for or make new tools as the game progresses.

Should they detect the player, zombies will apply the same single-minded pursuit until the player is either dead, or leaves the immediate area.\n\nThe game's title is a reference to an important event that occurs every seventh day of in-game time, whereby hordes of zombies attack the player's current location en masse\u2014unless sufficient preparation has been made and defences constructed, the player will quickly be overwhelmed.\n\n===Multiplayer===\nMultiplayer is available through player-hosted servers and enables multiple players to interact and communicate with each other on a single world. Interactions can be cooperative or hostile depending on the used server options. Players can run their own servers or use a hosting provider. Single player worlds have local area network support, allowing players to join worlds on locally interconnected computers without a server setup. Players are also able to provide [[Wide area network|Wide Area Network]] support via single player worlds.

The console ports have not received any updates since December 2017.\n\n'''Updates'''\n\nThe Fun Pimps released a statement on 16 October 2019, stating:\n\n\"Many are speculating as to the future of 7 Days to Die on consoles and The Fun Pimps wanted to be as transparent as possible so here is the reality of the situation...\n\nAfter a long and tedious legal process in a closed auction, The Fun Pimps have re-acquired full console publishing rights on the current and all future versions of 7 Days to Die on PS4 and the Xbox One.\n\nWe know there still is a steady and healthy 7 Days console community, as we hear from them on our social media channels all the time and the game still has nearly 10,000 concurrent users playing the game on weekends.\n\nAs far as updates, the console has not gotten a meaningful update since July 2017, which was content and features from the Alpha 15 PC version.\n\nThe Fun Pimps are a PC game developer and publisher...and we do not have the resources or expertise to do ports/updates to the console, so we licensed the console publishing rights to Telltale Games who hired Iron Galaxy who have done the ports with minimal TFP assistance.\n\nWe all had a great thing going...a full Alpha 16 port was in the works, that is, until Telltale's insolvency broke the cadence of builds, hurt our sales, reputation and created this unfortunate situation. Instead of investing in a new update, TFP spent a very large sum of money regaining the rights back in an auction, in addition to ongoing legal and auditing fees...\n\nNow that we are the console publisher, as an operational business and out of obligation to our investors and our hard working team (who need to provide for their families too) we have to evaluate the expense and risk of porting any future versions of the game to consoles relative to the income it could generate. Full console ports cost into the millions of dollars, not to mention the restrictions the platform holders have on not breaking saved games which would be inevitable given our current framework and the technical challenges associated with porting a resource intensive game like 7 Days to consoles.\n\nWith Sony and Microsoft, no matter how small, any update has to go through a rigorous testing/submission process.\n\nAs you can see, this is not an easy problem to solve. We are exploring all options that would eventually deliver a new version of 7 Days to consoles but this would likely happen after the PC version has gone gold and could end up being an entirely new product or on the next console.\n\nPlease understand: Telltale going under has put the console version of 7 Days in this situation. TFP are just trying to lookout for the future of our company and the game we care about...\n\nThe Fun Pimps will keep you updated as more information becomes available or if things change.\n\nWe thank you for all of the continued support.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://7daystodie.com/console-news/|title=Console News {{!}} 7 Days to Die|last=rhuenink|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n{{expand section|date=September 2016}}\n{{Video game reviews\n| PS4 = true\n| XONE = true\n| na = true\n| Destruct_XONE = 3/10<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/review-7-days-to-die-374415.phtml|title=Review: 7 Days to Die (XOne)|first=Jordan|last=Devore|website=[[Destructoid]]|publisher=Enthusiast Gaming|date=July 11, 2016|accessdate=July 11, 2016}}</ref>\n| GMaster_PS4 = 48%<ref>{{cite magazine|title=7 Days to Die (PS4)|magazine=[[GamesMaster (magazine)|GamesMaster]]|publisher=Future plc|date=September 2016|page=74}}</ref>\n| GSpot_XONE = 2/10<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/7-days-to-die-review/1900-6416470/|title=7 Days to Die Review (XOne)|first=Joab|last=Gilroy|website=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|date=July 7, 2016|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}</ref>\n| IGN_XONE = 4.9/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/13/7-days-to-die-review|title=7 Days to Die Review (Xbox One)|first=Leif|last=Johnson|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=July 13, 2016|accessdate=July 13, 2016}}</ref>\n| OPMUK_PS4 = 5/10<ref>{{cite magazine|title=7 Days to Die|magazine=[[PlayStation Official Magazine \u2013 UK]]|publisher=Future plc|date=September 2016|page=103}}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''The Digital Fix''\n| rev1_XONE = 4/10<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedigitalfix.com/gaming/content/3655/7-days-to-die/|title=7 Days to Die Review (XOne)|first=Peter|last=Taylor|website=The Digital Fix|publisher=Poisonous Monkey|date=July 19, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160722114842/http://gaming.thedigitalfix.com/content/id/3655/7-days-to-die.html|archivedate=July 22, 2016|url-status=live|accessdate=June 11, 2018}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]''\n| rev2_XONE = 2/10<ref>{{cite news|url=https://metro.co.uk/2016/07/05/7-days-to-die-review-undead-on-arrival-5987378/|title=7 Days To Die review -

The player is a survivor of the war who must survive by finding shelter, food and water, as well as scavenging supplies to fend off the numerous zombies (hinted to be the consequence of nuclear fallout) that populate Navezgane. Though there is no real objective except surviving at this moment, the developers hinted at a possible storyline that will be added in future updates.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Gameplay==\nIn \u201c7 Days to Die\u201d, the player spawns into a randomly-generated world or the preset world of Navezgane, Arizona, with the objective of surviving for as long as possible against the elements and the zombie hordes. As a survival game, the player character is in constant need of water and food for sustenance, as well as being vulnerable to injury and illness.

Interactions can be cooperative or hostile depending on the used server options. Players can run their own servers or use a hosting provider. Single player worlds have local area network support, allowing players to join worlds on locally interconnected computers without a server setup. Players are also able to provide [[Wide area network|Wide Area Network]] support via single player worlds.

The console ports have not received any updates since December 2017.\n\n'''Updates'''\n\nThe Fun Pimps released a statement on 16 October 2019, stating:\n\n\"Many are speculating as to the future of 7 Days to Die on consoles and The Fun Pimps wanted to be as transparent as possible so here is the reality of the situation...\n\nAfter a long and tedious legal process in a closed auction, The Fun Pimps have re-acquired full console publishing rights on the current and all future versions of 7 Days to Die on PS4 and the Xbox One.\n\nWe know there still is a steady and healthy 7 Days console community, as we hear from them on our social media channels all the time and the game still has nearly 10,000 concurrent users playing the game on weekends.\n\nAs far as updates, the console has not gotten a meaningful update since July 2017, which was content and features from the Alpha 15 PC version.\n\nThe Fun Pimps are a PC game developer and publisher...and we do not have the resources or expertise to do ports/updates to the console, so we licensed the console publishing rights to Telltale Games who hired Iron Galaxy who have done the ports with minimal TFP assistance.\n\nWe all had a great thing going...a full Alpha 16 port was in the works, that is, until Telltale's insolvency broke the cadence of builds, hurt our sales, reputation and created this unfortunate situation. Instead of investing in a new update, TFP spent a very large sum of money regaining the rights back in an auction, in addition to ongoing legal and auditing fees...\n\nNow that we are the console publisher, as an operational business and out of obligation to our investors and our hard working team (who need to provide for their families too) we have to evaluate the expense and risk of porting any future versions of the game to consoles relative to the income it could generate. Full console ports cost into the millions of dollars, not to mention the restrictions the platform holders have on not breaking saved games which would be inevitable given our current framework and the technical challenges associated with porting a resource intensive game like 7 Days to consoles.\n\nWith Sony and Microsoft, no matter how small, any update has to go through a rigorous testing/submission process.\n\nAs you can see, this is not an easy problem to solve. We are exploring all options that would eventually deliver a new version of 7 Days to consoles but this would likely happen after the PC version has gone gold and could end up being an entirely new product or on the next console.\n\nPlease understand: Telltale going under has put the console version of 7 Days in this situation. TFP are just trying to lookout for the future of our company and the game we care about...\n\nThe Fun Pimps will keep you updated as more information becomes available or if things change.\n\nWe thank you for all of the continued support.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://7daystodie.com/console-news/|title=Console News {{!}} 7 Days to Die|last=rhuenink|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n{{expand section|date=September 2016}}\n{{Video game reviews\n| PS4 = true\n| XONE = true\n| na = true\n| Destruct_XONE = 3/10<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/review-7-days-to-die-374415.phtml|title=Review: 7 Days to Die (XOne)|first=Jordan|last=Devore|website=[[Destructoid]]|publisher=Enthusiast Gaming|date=July 11, 2016|accessdate=July 11, 2016}}</ref>\n| GMaster_PS4 = 48%<ref>{{cite magazine|title=7 Days to Die (PS4)|magazine=[[GamesMaster (magazine)|GamesMaster]]|publisher=Future plc|date=September 2016|page=74}}</ref>\n| GSpot_XONE = 2/10<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/7-days-to-die-review/1900-6416470/|title=7 Days to Die Review (XOne)|first=Joab|last=Gilroy|website=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|date=July 7, 2016|accessdate=July 7, 2016}}</ref>\n| IGN_XONE = 4.9/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/13/7-days-to-die-review|title=7 Days to Die Review (Xbox One)|first=Leif|last=Johnson|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=July 13, 2016|accessdate=July 13, 2016}}</ref>\n| OPMUK_PS4 = 5/10<ref>{{cite magazine|title=7 Days to Die|magazine=[[PlayStation Official Magazine \u2013 UK]]|publisher=Future plc|date=September 2016|page=103}}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''The Digital Fix''\n| rev1_XONE = 4/10<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedigitalfix.com/gaming/content/3655/7-days-to-die/|title=7 Days to Die Review (XOne)|first=Peter|last=Taylor|website=The Digital Fix|publisher=Poisonous Monkey|date=July 19, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160722114842/http://gaming.thedigitalfix.com/content/id/3655/7-days-to-die.html|archivedate=July 22, 2016|url-status=live|accessdate=June 11, 2018}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]''\n| rev2_XONE = 2/10<ref>{{cite news|url=https://metro.co.uk/2016/07/05/7-days-to-die-review-undead-on-arrival-5987378/|title=7 Days To Die review - undead on arrival (XOne)|newspaper=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|publisher=[[DMG Media]]|date=July 5, 2016|accessdate=June 11, 2018}}</ref>\n| MC_PS4 = 45/100<ref name=\"MCPS4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/7-days-to-die|title=7 Days to Die for PlayStation 4 Reviews|website=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=June 28, 2016}}</ref>\n| MC_XONE = 35/100<ref name=\"MCXONE\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/7-days-to-die|title=7 Days to Die for Xbox One Reviews|website=Metacritic|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=June 28, 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of ''7 Days to Die'' received \"unfavorable\" reviews according to the [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] website [[Metacritic]].<ref name=\"MCPS4\" /><ref name=\"MCXONE\" />\n\nAs of June 2018 the game scored a \"very positive\" review by over 46,000 reviews on Steam<ref>{{cite web|url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/251570/7_Days_to_Die/|title=7 Days to Die|website=[[Steam (software)|Steam]]|publisher=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]]}}</ref> and was one of the \"Top 100 Selling games of 2017\" on Steam, despite still being in alpha stage development.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/01/02/biggest-steam-games-2017/|title=These are the top 100 Steam games of 2017|first=Alec|last=Meer|website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=January 2, 2018|accessdate=June 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://7daystodie.com/}}\n* {{moby game|id=/7-days-to-die}}\n\n[[Category:2016 video games]]\n[[Category:Early access video games]]\n[[Category:Horror video games]]\n[[Category:Indie video games]]\n[[Category:Kickstarter-funded video games]]\n[[Category:Linux games]]\n[[Category:Open world video games]]\n[[Category:MacOS games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 games]]\n[[Category:Post-apocalyptic video games]]\n[[Category:Steam Greenlight games]]\n[[Category:Survival video games]]\n[[Category:Unity (game engine) games]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Xbox One games]]\n[[Category:Zombie video games]]\n[[Category:Split-screen multiplayer games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United States]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Arizona]]\n", "name_user": "73.236.173.134", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eStory)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7_Days_to_Die"}

Members were Lee Lovett (bass), Gus Hawkins (sax/flute), Paul Stubblefield (drums), and Walter Winston (guitar). Larry Hancock (vocals/organ) was added in 1971 and Bernard (Beloyd) Taylor (guitar) replaced Walter Winston in 1972.<ref>''Joel Whitburn Presents Top R & B/Hip-Hop Singles, 1942-2004''</ref>\n\nIn 1970, the group won the first prize of $1,000 in Cleveland a battle-of-the-bands contest sponsored by [[the May Department Stores Company]], [[WHK (AM)|WHK]] radio station, and [[Musicor Records]].  They gained a recording contract with Musicor for their first single \"Down In The Ghetto\" (1971), produced by the TOP POP Recording Company 223 Kingston Avenue, Brooklyn, New York City.\n\nTwo years later, S.O.U.L. were back to New York to record ''What is It'', a LP with seven tracks of covers of jazz and funk tunes, that jumped for two months on the Top 40 album spot on [[Billboard charts|Billboard's]] soul album chart. The album was released in Europe just in the early 1990s on the BGP label.\n\nS.O.U.L. released seven singles between 1971 and 1974 for Musicor, cracking the top 50 [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot R & B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart in the summer of 1973. After a successful second LP, ''Can You Feel It?'',  the group split in 1975.  Taylor moved to Los Angeles in 1973 with the group Mellow Thunder headed up by Melvin Ware, after which under new publishing and production contracts with Ware, he and Peter Cor, wrote 27 songs one of which was \"Get Away\". Wares' publishing company made the deal with [[Earth, Wind & Fire]] for \"Getaway\" in 1976 and his production company struck the recording deal with [[20th Century Records]].  Hancock, also, moved to California and recorded for [[Decca Records]] including a duet with Alfie Silas; later he was part of the Platters.

Members were Lee Lovett (bass), Gus Hawkins (sax/flute), Paul Stubblefield (drums), and Walter Winston (guitar). Larry Hancock (vocals/organ) was added in 1971 and Bernard (Beloyd) Taylor (guitar) replaced Walter Winston in 1972.<ref>''Joel Whitburn Presents Top R & B/Hip-Hop Singles, 1942-2004''</ref>\n\nIn 1970, the group won the first prize of $1,000 in Cleveland a battle-of-the-bands contest sponsored by [[the May Department Stores Company]], [[WHK (AM)|WHK]] radio station, and [[Musicor Records]].  They gained a recording contract with Musicor for their first single \"Down In The Ghetto\" (1971), produced by the TOP POP Recording Company 223 Kingston Avenue, Brooklyn, New York City.\n\nTwo years later, S.O.U.L. were back to New York to record ''What is It'', a LP with seven tracks of covers of jazz and funk tunes, that jumped for two months on the Top 40 album spot on [[Billboard charts|Billboard's]] soul album chart. The album was released in Europe just in the early 1990s on the BGP label.\n\nS.O.U.L. released seven singles between 1971 and 1974 for Musicor, cracking the top 50 [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot R & B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart in the summer of 1973. After a successful second LP, ''Can You Feel It?'',  the group split in 1975.  Taylor moved to Los Angeles in 1973 with the group Mellow Thunder headed up by Melvin Ware, after which under new publishing and production contracts with Ware, he and Peter Cor, wrote 27 songs one of which was \"Get Away\". Wares' publishing company made the deal with [[Earth, Wind & Fire]] for \"Getaway\" in 1976 and his production company struck the recording deal with [[20th Century Records]].  Hancock, also, moved to California and recorded for [[Decca Records]] including a duet with Alfie Silas; later he was part of the Platters. Gus Hawkins went back to college and worked as phlebotomist at the Cleveland Clinic before moving to Atlanta, Georgia. Lovett and Stubblefield continued to work in recording studios and labels.

The last model to be formally known as a DeVille was the 2005 Cadillac DeVille, a full-size sedan, the largest car in the Cadillac model range at the time.

An (unshortened) limousine or (in the United States) town car has a division between the passenger and driver compartments and if the driver's seat is outside it may be called a ''sedanca de ville'' or town car.<ref name=\"cadillacdatabase1\"/>\n\nThe first Cadillac \"Coupe de Ville\" was shown during the [[General Motors Motorama#1949|1949 Motorama]]. It was built on a [[Cadillac Sixty Special]] chassis and featured a dummy air-scoop, chrome trim around front wheel openings, and a one-piece windshield and rear glass. The interior was black and trimmed in gray leather, including the headliner, to match the roof color. It was equipped with a telephone in the glove compartment, a vanity case and a secretarial pad in the rear armrest, power windows and highly decorative chrome interior trim. The prototype \"Coupe de Ville\" was used by GM President Charles E. Wilson until 1957 when he presented it to his secretary. At some time during this period it acquired a dark [[Vinyl top|Vicodec roof]].  The prototype \"Coupe de Ville\" was found again and beautifully restored in the 2nd decade of the New Millennium; it is currently (2016\u201317) in a private collection in London, Ontario, Canada.<ref name=\"cadillacdatabase2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cadillacdatabase.net/Dbas_txt/Facta-c.htm|title=Cadillac Terms and Definitions A - C|date=|publisher=Cadillacdatabase.net|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111112255/http://www.cadillacdatabase.net/Dbas_txt/Facta-c.htm|archivedate=2012-01-11|url-status=live|accessdate=2011-12-30|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Cadillac Series 62]] Coupe de Ville was introduced late in the 1949 model year. Along with the [[Buick Roadmaster]] [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]], and the [[Oldsmobile 98]] Holiday, it was among the first pillarless [[hardtop]] coupes ever produced. At $3,496 it was only a dollar less than the Series 62 convertible, and like the convertible, it came with power windows standard. It was luxuriously trimmed, with leather upholstery and chrome 'bows' in the headliner to simulate the ribs of a convertible top. In its first year the Series 62 Coupe de Ville only sold 2,150 units. But 1950 sales more than doubled to 4507, and in 1951 sales more than doubled again to 10,241 exceeding the sales for the Series 62 Club Coupe that year.

Similarly to the Coupe de Ville, it was also more expensive and more luxuriously trimmed that the standard 4-door Series 62. With 41,732 sold, it also easily outsold the Series 62 sedan in its very first year. Given their sales success, it was only natural that the Coupe de Ville and Sedan de Ville were moved to their own separate series in 1959, the Series 6300, being joined by a DeVille convertible in 1964.<ref name=\"kowalke1997\"/><ref name=\"gunnell2005\"/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== First generation (1959\u20131960) ==\n[[File:Cadillac Sedan De Ville 1959.jpg|thumb|left|1959 Cadillac Sedan de Ville]]\n[[File:1959 Cadillac Coupe Deville3.jpg|thumb|left|1959 Cadillac Coupe de Ville (rear)]]\n[[File:1960 Cadillac DeVille (1).jpg|thumb|left|1960 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\n[[File:2007-07-15 1960 Cadillac Coupe de Ville IMG 2946.jpg|thumb|left|1960 Cadillac Sedan de Ville]]\n\nThe 1959 [[Cadillac]] is remembered for its huge sharp tailfins with dual bullet tail lights, two distinctive rooflines and roof pillar configurations, new jewel-like grille patterns and matching deck lid beauty panels.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1959_Cadillac/1959_Cadillac_Comparison_Folder/1959%20Cadillac%20Comparison%20Folder-04.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-24 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225010824/http://oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1959_Cadillac/1959_Cadillac_Comparison_Folder/1959%20Cadillac%20Comparison%20Folder-04.html |archivedate=2015-02-25 |df= }}</ref> In 1959 the [[Cadillac Series 62|Series 62]] were moved from the Series 62 to their own series, the '''Series 6200'''.  DeVilles and 2-door [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorados]] became the '''Series 6300''' and '''Series 6400''' respectively, though they all, including the 4-door Eldorado [[Cadillac Brougham|Brougham]] (which was moved from the '''[[Cadillac Series 70|Series 70]]''' to '''Series 6900'''), shared the same {{convert|130|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase. Engine output was an even 325&nbsp;hp (242&nbsp;kW) from the {{convert|390|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engine. The DeVille Series had script nameplates on the rear fenders. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, back-up lamps, windshield wipers, two-speed wipers, wheel discs, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror, oil filter, power windows and two-way power seats. Plain fender skirts covered the rear wheels and 4-doors were available in either four-window or six-window hardtop configurations. Over 53,000 DeVilles were sold in their first year as a separate series, accounting for roughly 37% of all Cadillacs sold.\n\nThe 1960 Cadillacs had smoother, more restrained styling. General changes included a full-width grille, the elimination of pointed front bumper guards, increased restraint in the application of chrome trim, lower tailfins with oval shaped nacelles and front fender mounted directional indicator lamps. DeVilles were distinguished by special script nameplates on the rear fenders. Four-window and six-window hardtop sedans were offered again. The former featured a one-piece wraparound backlight and flat-top roof, while the latter had a sloping rear window and roofline. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, dual back-up lamps, windshield wipers, two-speed wipers, wheel discs, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror, oil filter, power windows and a two-way power seats. Technical highlights were finned rear drums and an X-frame construction. Interiors were done in Chadwick cloth or optional Cambray cloth and leather combinations.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Second generation (1961\u20131964) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Second generation\n| image        = 1961 Cadillac six window Sedan Deville fvl.jpg\n| caption      = 1961 Cadillac Sedan de Ville\n| model_years  = 1961&ndash;1964\n| assembly     = [[Detroit Assembly]], [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], U.S.\n| body_style   = 4-door 6-window [[hardtop]]<br>4-door 4-window [[hardtop]]<br>4-door Town Sedan 6-Window [[hardtop]]<br>4-door Park Avenue 4-Window [[hardtop]]<br>2-door [[hardtop]]<br>2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|129.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"gunnell2005\"/>\n| length       = 1961\u201362 (except for Town Sedan or Park Avenue): {{convert|222.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"gunnell2005\"/><br>1961 Town Sedan: {{convert|215.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"gunnell2005\"/><br>1962\u201363 Park Avenue: {{convert|215.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"gunnell2005\"/><br />1963 (except for Park Avenue): {{convert|223.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"gunnell2005\"/><br />1964: {{convert|223.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"gunnell2005\"/>\n| layout       = [[FR layout]]\n| engine       = {{convert|390|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine#390|OHV]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>{{convert|429|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine#429|OHV]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 4-speed [[Hydra-Matic]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]]<br>3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#Super Turbine 400 / THM400 / 3L80 / 3L80HD|TH-400]], [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| width        = 1961: {{convert|79.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"gunnell2005\"/><br>1962: {{convert|79.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"gunnell2005\"/><br>1963: {{convert|79.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"gunnell2005\"/><br>1964: {{convert|79.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"gunnell2005\"/>\n| height       = 1961\u201362: {{convert|56.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1963\u201364: {{convert|56.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| weight       = {{convert|4700|-|4900|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n| designer     = [[Bill Mitchell (designer)|Bill Mitchell]]\n| related      = [[Cadillac Eldorado]]<br>[[Cadillac Sixty Special]]<br>[[Cadillac Series 62]]<br>[[Buick Electra]]<br>[[Oldsmobile 98]]\n}}\n\n[[File:1961 Cadillac Coupe Deville (09).jpg|thumb|left|1961 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\n[[File:1961 Cadillac Coupe Deville (14).jpg|thumb|left|1961 Cadillac Coupe de Ville steering wheel]]\n[[File:Cadillac sedan de Ville 1962 exhibited at Schaffen-Diest 2013.JPG|thumb|left|1962 Cadillac Sedan de Ville]]\n[[File:1963 Cadillac Coupe de Ville (1).jpg|thumb|left|1963 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\n[[File:Cadillac sedan rear -- 08-20-2009.jpg|thumb|left|Short-rear-decked 1963 Cadillac Sedan de Ville Park Avenue]]\n[[File:Cadillac De Ville convertible arriving Schaffen-Diest.JPG|thumb|left|1964 Cadillac DeVille convertible]]\n\nCadillac was restyled and re-engineered for 1961. The new grille slanted back towards both the bumper and the hood lip, along the horizontal plane, and sat between dual headlamps. New forward slanting front pillars with non-wraparound windshield glass were seen. The revised backlight treatment had crisp angular lines with thin pillars on some models and heavier semi-blind quarter roof posts on others. DeVille models featured front series designation scripts and a lower body \"skeg\" trimmed with a thin, three-quarter-length spear molding running from behind the front wheel opening to the rear of the car. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, dual backup lights, windshield washer, dual speed wipers, wheel discs, plain fender skirts, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror, oil filter, power windows and 2-way power seats. Rubberized front and rear coil springs replaced the trouble prone air suspension system. Four-barrel induction systems were now the sole power choice and dual exhausts were no longer available. A new short-decked four-door Town Sedan hardtop appeared mid-season.\n\nA mild facelift characterized Cadillac styling trends for 1962. A flatter grille with a thicker horizontal center bar and more delicate cross-hatched insert appeared. Ribbed chrome trim panel, seen ahead of the front wheel housings in 1961, were now replaced with cornering lamps and front fender model and series identification badges were eliminated. More massive front bumper end pieces appeared and housed rectangular parking lamps. At the rear tail lamps were now housed in vertical nacelles designed with an angled peak at the center. A vertically ribbed rear beauty panel appeared on the deck lid latch panel. Cadillac script also appeared on the lower left side of the radiator grille. The short-deck [[hardtop]] Town Sedan was moved from the DeVille series  to the Series 6200, being replaced by a short-deck Park Avenue.<ref>Flory, J. \"Kelly\", Jr. ''American Cars 1960\u20131972'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Coy, 2004), p.147.</ref> In addition all short deck Cadillac models went from being 6-window sedans in 1961 to 4-window sedans in 1962 and 1963. Standard equipment included all of last year's equipment plus remote controlled outside rearview mirror, five tubeless black wall tires, heater and defroster and front cornering lamps. Cadillac refined the ride and quietness, with more insulation in the floor and behind the firewall.<ref>Flory, p.147.</ref> DeVille sales as a separate series exceeded their sales level as a trim level for the first time ever at 71,883 units, or nearly 45% of Cadillac's total sales.\n\nCadillac was restyled again for 1963. Exterior changes imparted a bolder and longer look. Hoods and deck lids were redesigned. The front fenders projected 4.625 inches further forward than in 1962 while the tailfins were trimmed down somewhat to provide a lower profile. Body-side sculpturing was entirely eliminated. The slightly V-shaped radiator grille was taller and now incorporated outer extensions that swept below the flush-fender dual headlamps. Smaller circular front parking lamps were mounted in those extensions. A DeVille signature script was incorporated above the lower beltline molding near the rear of the body. A total of 143 options including bucket seats with [[wool]], [[leather]], or [[nylon]] upholstery fabrics and wood veneer facings on dash, doors, and seatbacks, set an all-time record for interior appointment choices. Standard equipment was the same as the previous year. The engine displacement and output remained the same, {{convert|390|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|325|hp|kW|abbr=on}}.<ref>Flory, p.211.</ref>\n\nA minor facelift followed in 1964. New up front was a bi-angular grille that formed a V-shape along both its vertical and horizontal planes. The main horizontal grille bar was now carried around the body sides. Outer grille extension panels again housed the parking and cornering lamps. It was the 17th consecutive year for the Cadillac tailfins with a new fine-blade design carrying on the tradition. Performance improvements including a larger V-8 were the dominant changes for the model run. Equipment features were same as in 1963 for the most part. Comfort Control, a completely automatic heating and air conditioning system controlled by a dial thermostat on the instrument panel, was introduced as an industry first. The engine was bumped to {{convert|429|cid|l|0|abbr=on}}, with 340&nbsp;hp (253.5&nbsp;kW) available. Performance gains from the new engine showed best in the lower range, at 20 to 50&nbsp;mph traffic driving speeds. A new technical feature was the Turbo-Hydramatic transmission, also used in the Eldorado and the Sixty Special. A DeVille script above the lower belt molding was continued as an identifier. This was the first year for the DeVille convertible. DeVille sales reached 110,379 units, accounting for nearly two thirds of all Cadillacs sold.\n{{-}}\n\n== Third generation (1965\u20131970) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Third generation\n| image        = 1965 Cadillac.jpg\n| caption      = 1965 Cadillac Sedan de Ville\n| model_years  = 1965\u20131970\n| assembly     = [[Detroit Assembly]], [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], U.S.   \n| layout       = [[FR layout]]\n| platform     = [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]]\n| engine       = {{convert|429|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine#429|OHV]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>{{convert|472|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine#472|OHV]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#Super Turbine 400 / THM400 / 3L80 / 3L80HD|TH-400]], [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|129.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"gunnell2005\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1965_Cadillac/1965_Cadillac_Brochure_1/1965%20Cadillac-21.html |title=Directory Index: Cadillac/1965_Cadillac/1965_Cadillac_Brochure_1 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019011410/http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1965_Cadillac/1965_Cadillac_Brochure_1/1965%20Cadillac-21.html |archivedate=2013-10-19 |df= }}</ref>\n| length       = 1965\u201367: {{convert|224.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1968: {{convert|224.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"gunnell2005\"/><br />1969\u201370: {{convert|225.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"gunnell2005\"/>\n|body_style    = 4-door [[hardtop]]<br>4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]<br>2-door [[hardtop]]<br />2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]\n| width        = 1965\u201368: {{convert|79.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1969\u201370: {{convert|79.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height       = 1965\u201368: {{convert|55.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1969\u201370: {{convert|56.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| weight       = {{convert|4600|-|4900|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n| designer     = [[Bill Mitchell (designer)|Bill Mitchell]]\n| related      = [[Cadillac Eldorado]]<br>[[Cadillac Calais]]<br>[[Buick Electra]]<br>[[Oldsmobile 98]]\n}}\n\n[[File:1965 Cadillac Coupe Deville.jpg|thumb|left|1965 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\n[[File:1965 Cadillac Deville convertible dashboard1.jpg|thumb|left|1965 Cadillac de Ville convertible (interior)]]\n[[File:1966 Cadillac Deville convertible right.jpg|thumb|left|1966 Cadillac de Ville convertible]]\n[[File:1967 Cadillac DeVille (16439709295).jpg|left|thumb|1967 Cadillac Sedan de Ville]]\n[[File:1968 Cadillac Coupe Deville fvl1.jpg|thumb|left|1968 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\n[[File:1969 Cadillac Sedan Deville fvl.jpg|thumb|left|1969 Cadillac Sedan de Ville]]\n[[File:CADILLAC DE VILLE CONV-782.JPG|thumb|left|1970 Cadillac DeVille convertible]]\n\nAs it had been since DeVille became a separate series, DeVille denoted Cadillac's mainstream model, falling between the [[Cadillac Calais|Calais]] (which had replaced the [[Cadillac Series 62|Series 62]]) and the [[Cadillac Sixty Special|Sixty Special]] and [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado]]. The DeVille was redesigned for 1965 but rode on the same {{convert|129.5|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase. Tailfins were canted slightly downward, and sharp, distinct body lines replaced the rounded look. Also new were a straight rear bumper and vertical lamp clusters. The headlight pairs switched from horizontal to vertical, thus permitting a wider grille. Curved frameless side windows appeared, and convertibles acquired tempered glass backlights. New standard features included lamps for luggage, glove and rear passenger compartments and front and rear safety belts. Power was still supplied by the 340 horsepower {{convert|429|CID|cc|abbr=on}} V8, which would be replaced by the {{convert|472|CID|cc|abbr=on}} for 1968. Perimeter frame construction allowed repositioning the engine six inches forward in the frame, thus lowering the transmission hump and increasing interior room. Pillared sedans appeared on the DeVille series for the first time, while six-window hardtop sedans were dropped. A padded vinyl roof was a $121 extra-cost option on the hardtop model. All four DeVille models had small \"Tiffany-like\" script nameplates on the ends of their rear fenders just above the chrome [[side molding]].\n\nIn 1966 changes included a somewhat coarser mesh for the radiator grille insert, which was now divided by a thick, bright metal horizontal center bar housing rectangular parking lamps at the outer ends. Separate rectangular side marker lamps replaced the integral grille extension designs. There was generally less chrome on all Cadillac models this year. DeVille scripts were still above the rear tip of the horizontal body rub moldings. Cadillac crests and V-shaped moldings, front and rear, were identifiers. Cadillac \"firsts\" this season included variable ratio steering and optional front seats with carbon cloth heating pads built into the cushions and seatbacks. Comfort and convenience innovations were headrests, reclining seats and an AM/FM stereo system. Automatic level control was available. Engineering improvements made to the perimeter frame increased ride and handling ease. Newly designed piston and oil rings and a new engine mounting system and patented quiet exhaust were used.\n\nThe 1967 DeVilles were extensively restyled. Prominent styling features were given a powerful frontal appearance with forward-leaning front end, long, sculptured body lines, and redefined rear fenders that had more than just a hint of tail fins in them. The full-width, forward-thrusted \"eggcrate\" grille was flanked by dual stacked headlights for the third consecutive year. The squarer cornered grille insert had blades that seemed to emphasize its vertical members and it appeared both above the bumper and through a horizontal slot cut into it. Rectangular parking lamps were built into the outer edges of the grille. Rear end styling revisions were highlighted by metal divided tail lamps and a painted lower bumper section. Coupe de Villes got a new roofline, inspired by the Florentine show car created for the 1964 [[New York City|New York]] World's Fair, that gave rear seat passengers added privacy. As on that show car, the quarter window glass retracted rearward into a sail panel. Minor trim variations and slightly richer interiors separated DeVille from [[Cadillac Calais|Calais]]. Tiffany style chrome signature scripts were again found above the body side molding on the rear fenders. New standard DeVille features included non-glare [[rear-view mirror]], electric clock, Automatic Climate Controls, padded dashboard, Hazard Warning system, outboard seatbelt retractors and rear cigarette lighters in all styles. A slide-out fuse box and safety front seat back lock for two-door models were additional Cadillac advances for the 1967 model year. Technical improvements included a revised engine valve train, different carburetor, Mylar printed circuit instrument panel, re-tuned body mounts, and a new engine fan with clutch for quieter operation.  A GM-designed Energy Absorbing steering column and safety wheel became standard for all models.\n\nIn 1968 grilles had an insert with finer mesh and step down outer section which held the rectangular parking lights just a little higher than before. Rear end styling was modestly altered with the deck lid having more of a rake. The most obvious change was an 8.5-inch-longer hood designed to accommodate recessed windshield wiper-washers, which now came with three speeds standard. Of 20 exterior paint color combinations, 14 were totally new. On the inside enriched appointments included molded inner door panels with illuminated reflectors and a selection of 147 upholstery combinations, 76 in cloth, 67 in leather and four in vinyl. New standard features included a Light Group, a Mirror Group, a trip odometer and an ignition key warning buzzer. The DeVille also gained a new {{convert|472|CID|cc|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]] engine rated at 375&nbsp;hp (SAE gross). 1968 was also the last year for the \"stacked\" dual headlights, which were replaced with side-by-side dual headlights in 1969. This was also the last year for vent windows.  Side marker lights in the rear bumper as well as\nfront fender were also added.  Side mirror changed from a round to rectangular shape.\nAlso of note front disc brakes were available starting in 1968.  Cars built after January 1, 1968 got front shoulder belts per Federal safety standards.\n\nIn 1969 DeVille was restyled in the Eldorado image. An Eldorado-like front fender treatment evolved and helped to emphasize a stronger horizontal design line. Rear quarters were extended to give the car a longer look. There was an all new grille with dual horizontal headlamps positioned in the outboard step down areas of the grille. The hood was again extended, a total of 2.5 inches to add the impression of extra length. The roofline was squarer and the rear deck and bumper more sculptured. A new ventilation system eliminated the need for vent windows, which provided a longer sleeker look and improved visibility. New standard features included front and rear (except on convertibles) center seat armrests.  The ignition switch was moved from the instrument panel to the steering column, and included a steering wheel and transmission lock, one year ahead of a mandated Federal standard.\n\nIn 1970 a facelift included  a grille with 13 vertical blades set against a delicately cross-hatched rectangular opening. The bright metal headlamp surrounds were bordered with body color to give it a more refined look. Narrow vertical \"vee\" tail lights were seen again, but now had additional smaller V-shaped bottom lenses pointing downward below the bumper. Wheel discs and winged crest fender tip emblems were new. Exterior distinctions came from a DeVille script above the rear end of the belt molding and from the use of long rectangular back up light lenses set into the lower bumper as opposed to the smaller square lens used on the Calais. A new feature was a body color border around the edge of the vinyl top covering, when this option was ordered. 1970 was the last year that DeVille offered a convertible body style, 1970 was also the last model year for pillared sedans until hardtops were permanently dropped in 1977.  A total of 181,719 DeVilles were sold for that model year, accounting for 76% of all Cadillacs.\n{{-}}\n\n== Fourth generation (1971\u20131976) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Fourth generation\n| image = 1973 Cadillac Sedan Deville.jpg\n| caption = 1973 Cadillac Sedan de Ville\n| model_years = 1971\u20131976\n| assembly = [[Detroit Assembly]], [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], U.S.<br />[[Linden, New Jersey]], U.S.\n| layout = [[FR layout]]\n| platform = [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|130.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| body_style = 4-door [[hardtop]]<ref>{{cite web |author=John Barach |url=http://www.100megsfree4.com/cadillac/cad1970/cad71d.htm |title=Cadillac history 1971 |publisher=100megsfree4.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-20 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100911104351/http://100megsfree4.com/cadillac/cad1970/cad71d.htm |archivedate=2010-09-11 |df= }}</ref><br>2-door [[hardtop]]<br>2-door [[coupe]]\n| engine = {{convert|472|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine#472|OHV]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br /> {{convert|500|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine#500|OHV]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#Super Turbine 400 / THM400 / 3L80 / 3L80HD|TH-400]], [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| length       = 1971: {{convert|225.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1972: {{convert|227.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1973: {{convert|227.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1974\u201376: {{convert|230.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width        = {{convert|79.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height       = 1971\u201373: {{convert|54.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1974: {{convert|54.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1975\u201376: {{convert|54.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| weight       = {{convert|4900|-|5400|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n| related      = [[Cadillac Calais]]<br>[[Buick Electra]]<br>[[Oldsmobile 98]]<br>[[Buick Estate]]<br>[[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser]]<br>[[Pontiac Grand Safari]]<br />[[Pontiac Safari]]<br />[[Chevrolet Kingswood]]<br/>[[Chevrolet Townsman]]\n| designer     = [[Bill Mitchell (designer)|Bill Mitchell]]\n}}\n\n[[File:1971 Cadillac Coupe Deville (17).jpg|thumb|left|1971 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\n[[File:Cadillac Coupe de Ville 1972 (5135993539).jpg|thumb|left|1972 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\n[[File:1973 Cadillac Coupe Deville (1).jpg|thumb|left|1973 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\n[[File:1973 Cadillac Coupe Deville (11).jpg|thumb|left|1973 Cadillac Coupe de Ville (interior)]]\n[[File:1974 Cadillac Coupe DeVille red.jpg|thumb|left|1974 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\n[[File:1974 Cadillac Coupe Deville rvl.jpg|thumb|left|1974 Cadillac Coupe de Ville (rear)]]\n[[File:1975 Cadillac Coupe Deville fvr.jpg|thumb|left|1975 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\n[[File:1976 Cadillac Coupe Deville (9459532865).jpg|thumb|left|1976 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\n\nAs with all GM full-size lines, the DeVille was completely redesigned for 1971. The new GM full-size bodies, at 64.3 inches front shoulder room (62.1 inches on Cadillac) and 63.4 inches rear shoulder room (64.0 inches on Cadillac) set a record for interior width that would not be matched by any car until the full-size GM rear-wheel-drive models of the early to mid-1990s. Pairs of individually housed squarish headlamps were set wider apart. The V-shaped grille had an eggcrate style insert and was protected by massive vertical guards framing a rectangular license plate indentation. A wide hood with full-length windsplints, a prominent center crease and hidden windshield wipers was seen. A Cadillac crest decorated the nose and new indicator lamps appeared atop each front fender. A horizontal beltline molding ran from behind the front wheel housing, almost to the rear stopping where an elliptical bulge in the body came to a point and where thin rectangular side markers were placed above and below the chrome strip. The rear wheel openings were again housed in fender skirts. Tail lamps were of the same type as before but were no longer divided by a chrome bar. Long horizontal back-up lamps were set in the bumper, on either side of a deeply recessed license plate housing. DeVilles were set apart visually by thin bright metal rocker panel steps and signature script on the front fenders bearing the series name. The bottoms of the rear fenders were decorated with a bright metal beauty panel that was wider than the rocker panel strips and blended into the molding running along the bottom of the fender skirt. The standard engine remained the [[Cadillac V8 engine#472|472]], still rated at 375 SAE gross horsepower and {{convert|525|lb\u00b7ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque.\nInteriors were redesigned, featuring a new curved instrument panel and new seating configurations. A rear \"lamp monitor\", a fiber-optic system which monitored the taillamps, turn signals and brake lights, was new and positioned on the shelf behind the rear seat.\n\nIn November 1971, a showroom-stock 1971 Coupe de Ville placed third in the annual coast-to-coast Cannonball Run, posting the highest average speed of the event, {{convert|84.6|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} (excluding stops) and averaging {{convert|8.9|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn 1972, a modest frontal revision placed more emphasis on horizontal grille blades. The parking lamps were moved from the bumper to between the square bezeled headlamps, which were now set wider apart. V-shaped emblems made a return on hood and deck lid. New standard features included a bumper impact system, automatic parking brake release, passenger assist straps and flow through ventilation system. New DeVille signature script was affixed to the sides of the rear roof panels. Sales reached a record 194,811.\n\nNew energy absorbing bumpers were seen on all GM cars in 1973 and it brought styling refinements to DeVille. Grilles were widened and had an intricate eggcrate design. Larger vertical rectangles housed the parking lamps between wide spaced headlamps which had square bezels but round lenses. Bumpers ran fully across the front and wrapped around each end. Vertical guards were spaced much further apart at a point outboard of the grille. The rear end had a bumper with a flatter upper section housing an angled license plate recess. Border outline moldings vertically \"veed\" paralleled the fender edge shape at the rear bodysides. Single horizontally mounted rectangular rear side marker lamps were placed over and under the rear tip of the thin beltline trim. Cadillac script was seen on the front fender sides below the belt molding behind the wheel opening.Inside, \"soft-pillow\" door panels with larger, sturdier pull-straps were new. The rear \"lamp monitor\" was repositioned from the rear seat shelf to the headliner just above the rear window. An Illuminated vanity mirror was an available option. This was the final year for hardtop Coupe de Villes, an irony since it was their introduction of the hardtop that made them such a sensation in 1949. Sales set a new record at 216,243.\n\nIn 1974, a wide eggcrate grille was used. Dual round headlamps were mounted close together in square bezels. Further outboard were double deck wraparound parking lamps. Shorter vertical grille guards appeared in about the same position as before. Rear fendersides were flatter without the elliptical bulge. The thin beltline molding was positioned lower by several inches. The rear end had vertical bumper ends with integrated side marker lights. New taillamps were positioned horizontally beneath the trunk lid. Both bumpers, especially the rear, protruded further from the body. Unlike the other \"C\" body GM coupes, the Coupe de Ville was no a longer true hardtop, instead sporting large wide \"coach\" windows giving a thick center pillar look. They retained their frameless door glass, however.  The Sedan de Ville continued as a true hardtop however, and would remain so until the 1977 model.  A new curved instrument panel housed a new quartz controlled digital clock. New standard features included an integral litter container. A Space Saver spare tire was standard when DeVilles were ordered with optional white sidewall steel belted radial tires.\n\n1974 also saw the introduction of the optional \"[[Air Cushion Restraint System]]\". Known today as airbags, this option provided protection for front seat occupants in the case of a frontal collision. One bag was located in the steering wheel, the other in the dashboard in front of the front seat passenger. The glove box was replaced with a lockable storage compartment under the dashboard. The option was expensive and therefore unpopular with customers and was discontinued after the 1976 model year. Cadillac would not offer airbags again until the 1990 model year.\n\nA new option package was a fully padded '''Cabriolet''' roof treatment. It incorporated a [[Landau (automobile)|landau]]-style top with bright metal forward divider strip. Another new option package was the '''d'Elegance''' package. Similar to the Sixty Special Brougham's package of the same name, it featured [[velour]] upholstery, Deluxe padded doors, front seatback storage pockets, deep pile carpeting, floor mats, see-through standup hood ornament and vinyl tape accent stripes. The \"d'Elegance\" name remained with the DeVille series as a package through 1984. For 1997, it became a separate model designation for the sedan.\n\nStyling changes for 1975 brought dual rectangular headlamp lenses flanked by rectangular cornering lights wrapped around squared-off front fenders. A new cross hatched grille also appeared, with Cadillac script on the header. Sedan's now featured thin opera windows set within the D-pillars. New standard equipment included front fender lamp monitors, power door locks, high energy ignition, steel-belted radial whitewall tires. The 210&nbsp;hp 500 V8 replaced the 472 as the standard engine. Electronic fuel injection became optional in March 1975. Another option was the Astroroof with sliding sunshade that permitted use as an electrically operated sunroof or a transparent closed skylight. An ordinary sunroof panel was also available. New hinged door pull handles replaced the old door pull straps for 1975 and 1976.\n\nIn 1976, the grille saw a new and finer crosshatching pattern. Cornering lamps received new horizontal silver trim; taillamp\nBezels also gained new chrome-like trim. Eight different color accent stripes were available. Vinyl tops were now integral padded Elk grain material. New trims included sporty plaids, plush velours, knits and 11 distinctive genuine leathers. Coupe de Villes had a new vinyl roof whose top molding served as a continuation of the door \"belt\" molding. A Controlled (limited-slip) Differential was included for extra traction. An optional illuminated entry and theft deterrence system was optional. The new [[ACDelco|Delco Freedom]] battery, never needed water added.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1976_Cadillac/1976%20Cadillac%20Full%20Line%20Brochure/image3.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-05-15 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509191541/http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1976_Cadillac/1976%20Cadillac%20Full%20Line%20Brochure/image3.html |archivedate=2018-05-09 |df= }}</ref> New turbine-vaned and wire wheel covers were offered. A new option locked the doors when the transmission lever was shifted to \"Drive\". Cadillac also offered Track Master, a computerized skid prevention system that automatically pumped the back brakes in an emergency to shorten stopping distance. New options included a push-button Weather Band built into the AM/FM stereo signal-seeking radio, loose pillow style seats for d'Elegance packages, plus power passenger and manual driver seatback recliners for 50/50 front seats. Of the 15 standard and six optional Firemist body colors, 13 were new this year. New standard features included Soft-Ray [[tinted glass]], spare tire cover, trunk mat, washer fluid level indicator, and steel belted radial whitewall tires.\n\nFrom 1975 to 1976 small numbers of Coupe de Villes were converted into car-based pick-ups, similar to a [[Chevrolet El Camino]], but much more upscale. Coachbuilding company Traditional Coach Works manufactured 204 of these, called the '''Cadillac Mirage''', to Cadillac's standards, such that one could be ordered through a participating Cadillac dealer.<ref name=Mirage1>[http://www.facereplace.com/mirage/History%20of%20the%20Cadillac%20Mirage.htm History of the Cadillac Mirage \u2013 facereplace.com]</ref> The floor bed could carry flat plywood 4 x 8 sheets with the tailgate closed, while the two-seat front cabin offered driver and passenger a plush ride. A storage area behind the seats was used for golf-clubs or small articles of value, out of view. A metal cover with a lock on it was available for the rear bed, just as a trunk would also have.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_kJlN_Sm0o Cadillac Mirage video review \u2013 The Drive]</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Fifth generation (1977\u20131984) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Fifth generation\n| image        = 1977 Cadillac Coupe Deville (01).jpg\n| caption      = 1977 Cadillac Coupe de Ville\n| production = 1977\u20131984\n| assembly     = {{ubl | [[Detroit Assembly]], [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] | [[Linden Assembly]], [[Linden, New Jersey]] | [[South Gate Assembly]], [[South Gate, California]] }}\n| designer     = [[Bill Mitchell (designer)|Bill Mitchell]]\n| body_style   = 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]<br>2-door [[coupe]]\n| platform     = [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]]\n| related      = [[Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham]]<br>[[Buick Electra]]<br>[[Oldsmobile 98]]\n| layout       = [[FR layout]]\n| engine       = {{ubl | {{convert|250|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac High Technology engine#HT-4100|''HT-4100'']] [[V8 engine|V8]] | {{convert|252|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V6 engine#LC4|''LC4'']] [[V6]] | {{convert|368|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine#368 and V8-6-4|''L62'']] V8 | {{convert|425|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine#425|''L33/L35'']] V8 |{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Oldsmobile Diesel engine#LF9|''LF9'']] [[Diesel engine|diesel]] V8 }}\n| transmission = 3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#Super Turbine 400 / THM400 / 3L80 / 3L80HD|TH-400]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]<br>3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM350|TH-350C]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]<br>4-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM200-4R|TH-200-4R]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| wheelbase    = 1977\u201379: {{convert|121.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1980\u201382: {{convert|121.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1983\u201384: {{convert|121.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length       = 1977\u201379: {{convert|221.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1980\u201384: {{convert|221.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width        = {{convert|76.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height       = 1977: {{convert|57.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1978\u201384 4-door: {{convert|56.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>2-door: {{convert|54.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|weight        = {{convert|4000|-|4400|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\n[[File:Cadillac 1977 Sedan de Ville .jpg|thumb|left|1977 Cadillac Sedan de Ville]]\n[[File:1978 Cadillac Coupe DeVille (01).jpg|thumb|left|1978 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\n[[File:1977-1979 Cadillac Coupe de Ville front.jpg|thumb|left|1979 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\n[[File:1979 Cadillac Coup\u00e9 deVille.jpg|thumb|left|1979 Cadillac Coupe de Ville (rear)]]\n[[File:1980 Cadillac Coupe Deville fvl2.jpg|thumb|left|1980 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\n[[File:1980 Cadillac Sedan DeVille (14).jpg|thumb|left|1980 Cadillac Sedan de Ville]]\n[[File:1980 Cadillac Coupe Deville interier1.jpg|thumb|left|1980 Cadillac Coupe de Ville (interior)]]\n[[File:81 Cadillac Sedan de Ville V864.jpg|thumb|left|1981 Cadillac Sedan de Ville]]\n[[File:1982 Cadillac Coupe DeVille side view.jpg|thumb|left|1982 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\n[[File:1983 Cadillac Coup\u00e9 de Ville.jpg|thumb|left|1983 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\n[[File:Cadillac Sedan de Ville 2012-07-15 15-12-36.JPG|thumb|left|1984 Cadillac Sedan de Ville]]\n\n1977 was Cadillac's 75th anniversary, and saw the introduction of the downsized DeVille coupes and sedans. These new cars featured a higher roofline, resulting in a vehicle that was over nine inches shorter, four inches narrower, and 1/2 ton lighter than the previous year, but with a larger trunk and more headroom and legroom. These were also the first DeVilles ever to be marketed without [[fender skirts]] over the rear wheels. The old door pull straps returned for 1977 and on. The 500 in<sup>3</sup> V8 (which produced 190 horsepower) was replaced for 1977 by a 180-horsepower 425 in<sup>3</sup> V8 variant of similar design. The reduction in size and weight was implemented to improve fuel economy and emissions as a result of the United States Federal Government passage of [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] regulations.\n\nFor 1977, the lineup included the two-door Coupe de Ville ($9,654) and four-door Sedan de Ville ($9,864). The $650 d'Elegance package, an interior dress-up option carried over from the previous generation of DeVilles, continued for both models. 3-sided, wrap-around tail lamps were a 1977 feature only (although they would re-appear in 1987). Coupe de Ville's popular \"Cabriolet\" option, priced at $348, included a rear-half padded vinyl roof covering and opera lamps. An optional electronic fuel-injected version of the standard 7.0-liter powerplant, adding {{convert|15|hp}}, was available for an additional $647. Sales figures were 138,750 Coupe de Villes and 95,421 Sedan de Villes for an all-time sales record of 234,171 DeVilles sold.\n\nIn addition to a redesigned grille and hood ornament, 1978 saw slim, vertical tail lamps inset into chrome bumper end caps with built-in side marker lamps (Cadillac would retain this \"vertical tail lamp inset\" design feature on DeVille through 1984, and again from 1989 through 1999). New for 1978, a \"Phaeton\" package was optional for DeVille. Available on both coupe and sedan, the $1,929 Phaeton package featured a simulated convertible-top, special pin striping, wire wheel discs, and \"Phaeton\" name plates in place of the usual \"Coupe de Ville\" or \"Sedan de Ville\" ornament on the rear fenders. Inside were leather upholstered seats and a leather-trimmed steering wheel matching the exterior color. The package was available in \"Cotillion White\" (with Dark Blue roof), \"Platinum Silver\" (with a Black roof), or \"Arizona Beige\" (with a Dark Brown roof). Coupe de Ville's popular Cabriolet roof package was priced at $369, while the d'Elegance package (for coupe or sedan) was available at $689. Electronic [[fuel injection]], which added {{convert|15|hp}}, was available at $744. Electronic level control - which used suspension-mounted sensors and air filled rear shocks - kept the car's height level regardless of passengers and cargo weight, was available for $140. Sales dropped slightly from 1977 to 117,750 for the $10,444 Coupe de Ville, and 88,951 for Sedan de Ville, priced at $10,668.\n\nWith bigger changes coming in 1980, the 1979 models saw few alterations,  which included a new lightweight aluminum hood and a new grille design with \"Cadillac\" script on the header above the grille. The \"Phaeton\" package, now priced at $2,029, was still available in three colors, but with two new replacement colors: \"Western Saddle Firemist\" (with leather interior in \"Antique Saddle\") replacing the \"Arizona Beige\", and \"Slate Firemist\" (with leather interior in \"Antique Gray\") replacing \"Platinum Silver\". The d'Elegance package was back, at $725, which included Venetian velour upholstery (in four colors) with a 50/50 split front seat, overhead assist handles, Tangier carpeting, door pull handles, and \"d'Elegance\" emblems among other niceties. In addition to the $783 \"fuel-injection\" option, there was also the choice of a 350 in<sup>3</sup> LF9 diesel V8 (built by [[Oldsmobile]]) for $849. Coupe de Ville's cabriolet package, priced at $384, was available in 17 colors. Production rose slightly to 121,890 for Coupe de Ville ($11,728), and 93,211 for Sedan de Ville ($12,093).\n\n1980 saw a significant refresh, with a lower, more aerodynamic nose, higher tail end, and a heavier, more substantial appearance. The Phaeton option was discontinued, but the $1,005 d'Elegance package remained. The Coupe de Ville now wore full, bright side window surround moldings, whereas the sedan had body-color door frames with a thin chrome bead around the window opening (as used in 1977 - 1979). The chromed-plastic grille held a very diplomatic, [[Rolls-Royce (car)|Rolls-Royce]] inspired design, with thick vertical bars, featuring the 'Cadillac' script on the driver's side grille header. The grille cast for 1980 was used again for the 1989 to 1992 [[Cadillac Brougham]]. Late in the 1980 model year, V6 power (in the form of a 4-bbl 252 CID engine manufactured by [[Buick]]) was offered as a credit option. Cadillac had not offered an engine with fewer than 8 cylinders since 1914. The standard engine for 1980 was a new 368 CID (6.0 L) V8. Unlike the pre-1980 models, the rear window glass for both two- and four-door models was now the same, as the two-door models did away with the sporty slanted rear window and adopted the formal vertical look shared with the sedans. Pricing for DeVille was $12,899 for the coupe; $13,282 for the sedan. Sales dropped miserably for the 1980 model year, despite new sheetmetal and a multitude of improvements. Coupe de Ville was down to 55,490 (less than half of the 1979 figures), Sedan de Ville was also down by nearly half at 49,188. Oldsmobile's 5.7-liter diesel V8 was still available at $924, as was the popular Cabriolet option for Coupe de Ville at $350.\n\n1981's biggest news was the introduction of Cadillac's modulated-displacement 368 in<sup>3</sup> V8-6-4 engine.  Developed by the [[Eaton Corporation]] - with design elements that had been tested for over {{convert|500000|mi|km}} - allowed various engine computers to decide how many cylinders were needed to power the car for optimal fuel economy. The theory was 8 cylinders from a complete stop, 6 cylinders during usual driving, and just four cylinders at cruising speed. The changes in cylinder operation were seamless, and most drivers did not detect any difference in operation. However, in some cases, reliability and component failure led to customer complaints. Cadillac defended its micro-processor controlled powerplant, and even offered special extended warranties to customers. Also available was [[Oldsmobile]]'s 5.7-liter V-8 diesel engine. The {{convert|125|hp}} [[Buick]] V6, teamed with an automatic transmission, returned for 1981 after a short initial offering in the spring of 1980. Coupe de Ville was priced at $13,450, while Sedan de Ville, priced at $13,847, now had the unique option of an available automatic seat belt system - the first offered on a GM vehicle. With the automatic shoulder/lap belt system (only for the outboard front seat passengers), the shoulder point was moved from the upper B-pillar to the upper door glass frame, and the belt reel was moved from the floor onto the door itself, installed in the lower corner. With this, you could theoretically leave the seat belt latched at all times, and simply get in and out of the vehicle without having to unfasten the belt. The $150 option (which would re-appear as standard equipment on the 1990 - 1992 Brougham), was available only on V6-powered Sedan de Villes. The [[V6]] option itself was a $165 credit over the standard V8 in DeVille. A new grille design was made up of small squares, similar to the pattern from 1979, while the same chromed grille surround from 1980 continued. The egg-crate 1981 grille cast was used again for the 1987 and 1988 [[Cadillac Brougham]] models. A new Electronic Climate Control panel did away with the slide lever and thumb wheel in favor of a digital display which allowed the driver to set the interior temperature to a single degree - from 65 to 85 (or \"max\" settings at 60 and 90 degrees). Option groups included the $1,005 d'Elegance package (available on both models), and the Cabriolet package (for Coupe de Ville) at $363. Sales were up slightly from 1980: 89,991 sedans versus 62,724 coupes (figures include DeVille and Fleetwood models).\n\nChanges for 1982 were kept to a minimum, including a new thin vertical bar grille design (which was used through 1986) with the same grille surround from the past two years, and a new standard wheel cover design. Cadillac introduced a new aluminum-block 249-cubic-inch 4.1-liter HT series V8 engine to replace the V8-6-4. The new power plant featured a closed-loop digital fuel injection system, free-standing cast-iron cylinders within a cast-aluminum block, and was coupled with a 4-speed automatic-overdrive transmission. Other engine options included the Buick V6 or Oldsmobile's diesel V8. Inside, the Electronic Climate Control had an updated fascia that now included an \"Outside Temperature\" button. Previously, the outside temperature was available through an illuminated thermometer mounted to the driver's outside mirror. With the new front-drive Cadillac Cimarron taking over as Cadillac's entry-level model, the $15,249 Coupe de Ville was now a step-up. Sedan de Ville was priced at $15,699. Sales totals for 1982 included 50,130 coupes and 86,020 sedans (figures include DeVille and Fleetwood models).\n\nFor 1983, slight reworkings under the hood added 10 horsepower (now rated at 135) to the standard 4.1-liter powerplant. Meanwhile, the Buick V6 credit-option was dropped. The biggest visible change was hardly noticeable - while the grille design was a carry-over from the previous year (and would be through 1986), the Cadillac script moved from the chrome header onto the grille itself. The wide parking lamps below the quad headlamps now had clear frosted lenses (previous years they were amber), with satin gold-colored winged Cadillac emblems centered on each lens. A very minor change in the rear was the deletion of the chrome tips on both sides of the lower deck lid trim. These little chrome corner pieces, mounted on the filler panels, were prone to pitting as they were made of a different material than the bright aluminum trunk trim and upper license late surround. Coupe de Ville's popular Cabriolet roof package added $415 to its $15,970 sticker price. While both models, including the $16,441 Sedan de Ville, could be ordered with the $1,150 d'Elegance package. 1983 was supposed to be the last year for the rear-drive DeVille, as new front-drive models would take over for 1984. However, numerous developmental delays caused DeVille to stay in rear-drive form for another year. Sales figures looked healthy, with a total of 109,004 sedans and 65,670 coupes (figures include DeVille and Fleetwood models).\n\nBecause of a delay in production of the new front-drive DeVilles (which were now going to be 1985 models), 1984 was a rerun for the rear-wheel-drive Coupe de Ville ($17,140) and its four-door companion, the popular Sedan de Ville ($17,625). It would also be the last time DeVille used the \"V\" emblem below the Cadillac crest, as 1985 models and on would use the crest and wreath emblem - formerly a Fleetwood exclusive. Minor changes included new body-color side moldings and a revised exhaust system with a revamped catalytic converter. The diesel V8 was now available at no additional charge. While the optional d'Elegance package remained at $1,150, the Cabriolet option for Coupe de Ville went up to $420. For 1984, sales figures show a total four-door production of 107,920 units, and an additional 50,840 two-door units (figures include de Ville and Fleetwood models). The new front-drive 1985 Coupe de Ville and Sedan de Ville arrived in Cadillac showrooms during the Spring of 1984, about six months earlier than most new-car introductions, so both the 1984 rear-drive and 1985 front-drive models were selling and being produced (due to separate assembly plants) at the same time for nearly half a year.\n\n''' Size comparison between 1974 and 1977 Cadillac

Deville (02).jpg|thumb|left|1993 Cadillac Sedan de Ville]]\n\nFor the 1985 model year, the DeVille switched to GM's new FWD [[GM C platform (FWD)|C-body]] platform. A Fleetwood sedan variant was added to the mix at the start of production and shared the new [[front-wheel-drive]] platform and most dimensions with the DeVilles (the \"Fleetwood Brougham\" nomenclature remained on the rear-wheel-drive chassis through model year 1986 at which time the \"Fleetwood\" portion of the name was dropped and it became simply \"Brougham\" from 1987 through 1992).\n\nProduction of the new C-body commenced December 1983 at the [[Orion Assembly]] Plant in [[Orion Township, Michigan]]. A Fleetwood coupe version of the new FWD C-body joined the lineup later in the production run. The front cover of the brochure advertised the new cars as the \"Cadillac of Tomorrow\".  These new models were significantly smaller externally yet kept almost identical interior dimensions as their predecessors.  This change also brought nearly the entire Cadillac line of cars to front-wheel drive, leaving only the Fleetwood Brougham as the only rear-wheel-drive car offered by the division. Cadillac's [[Cadillac High Technology engine#HT-4100|HT-4100]] [[V8 engine|V8]] remained the standard engine, mounted transversely and coupled with a [[Turbo-Hydramatic 125#Turbo-Hydramatic 440-T4|440-T4]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]. Oldsmobile's 4.3L V6 diesel was optional. Of GM's front-drive C and H bodies, Cadillac was the only line to offer a V8 engine. The other GM vehicles were equipped with a Buick-derived 3.0 or 3.8 V6 engine, or - for 1985 only - Oldsmobile's 4.3L V6 diesel powerplant.\n\nThe 1985 DeVille was still available in [[sedan (car)|sedan]] or [[coupe]] form.  The d'Elegance package - an optional interior dress-up package featuring assist handles and button-tufted seating among other niceties - was no longer available on DeVille, but now offered solely on the Fleetwood sedan.  Thanks to an extended model year (starting April 1984), sales of the new downsized 1985 DeVille and Fleetwood models reached nearly 200,000 units.\n\nFor 1986, few changes marked the new DeVille's second year in production. An anti-lock braking system, developed by Teves, became available. A 2-position automatic rear-view mirror utilized two electronic 'eyes' and a small motor to dim when headlights appeared from behind. A factory-installed cellular telephone joined the option list at an astonishing $2,850. The standard space-saver spare tire now sat horizontally in the trunk, doing away with the small covered storage cubby in the spare tire well from last year. The optional aluminum wheels had new flush-fitting center caps (last year's design featured exposed capped lugs), and bumper rub strips changed from black to gray. Borrowed from the front-wheel-drive Fleetwood line, the narrow lower body side molding from the 1985 DeVille was replaced with a considerably wider one, and the trim surround from the rear window gave the formal appearance of a smaller window opening. Inside, a more tailored look was applied to the seat trim. Coupe de Ville's popular cabriolet option, featuring a padded vinyl covering over the rear half of the roof, was priced at $698. Along with the exterior changes made to 1986 DeVilles, adding the Cabriolet option made it difficult to distinguish a 1986 Coupe de Ville from the 1986 Fleetwood Coupe. Pricing for the Coupe de Ville was $19,669, with Sedan de Ville at $19,990. The transverse-mounted Cadillac 4.1-liter V-8 continued from the previous year, but with 5 more horsepower.\n\nThe 1986 Cadillac had:\nType: 90-degree, overhead valve V-8. Aluminum block and cast iron heads.\nDisplacement: 249 cu in (4.1 liters) \nBore & stroke: 3.47 x 3.31 in \nCompression ratio: 8.5:1 \nBrake horsepower: {{convert|135|hp|abbr=on}} at 4200 rpm \nTorque: 200&nbsp;lbf\u00b7ft (270 N\u00b7m) at 2200 rpm \nFive main bearings \nHydraulic valve lifters \nTBI \nVIN Code: 8\n\nIntroduced in 1986, Cadillac's Touring Sedan and Touring Coupe were based on the standard DeVille but included extras such as a subtle rear deck lid spoiler, body-color tail lamp bezels, front air dam with fog lamps, rear seat headrests, leather upholstery, and a performance enhancement package among other features. The package was available for $2,880. In addition, the Touring Coupe had removable decorative louvers on the rear edge of the side opera windows.\n\n1987 saw a new front-end design including revised cornering lamps in front and one-piece composite headlamps flanked a trapezoid-shaped grille with a bold egg-crate texture. Elongated fender caps were in back - upping the overall length by an inch and a half, but much more dramatic in appearance with new wrap-around tail lamps. This new 3-sided tail lamp style was inspired by a design used on the 1977 DeVille. Unlike the new one-piece headlamps, the changes to the rear-end in 1987 had little to do with engineering, but rather, feedback from Cadillac's customer base who felt the 1985-86 car looked too short. Although the 1987 revamp was still quite similar to the 1986 model (so much in fact that it still used the previous year's deck lid), the design was more in-tune with the look that traditional Cadillac buyers were used to.\n\nPricing for 1987 included Coupe de Ville at $21,316, and Sedan de Ville at $21,659.  Fleetwood d'Elegance at $26,104, and the new Fleetwood Sixty-Special was available for $34,850. The Touring option, priced at $2,880 over DeVille's base cost, also included aluminum wheels mounted on 15-inch Goodyear Eagle GT tires. At the end of the 1988 model year, Cadillac discontinued the slow-selling DeVille-based Touring Coupe and Sedan, although the 4-door would return in 1992.\n\nFor 1988, Cadillac kept cosmetic changes to a minimum in anticipation of the redesigned DeVille and Fleetwood models to come the following year.  To mitigate the nearly $2,000 price jump this year, several previously optional items were made standard equipment including tilt steering column, telescopic steering wheel, power trunk release, split-bench front seating, cruise control, and variable delay windshield wipers. Under the hood was a new 155&nbsp;hp 4.5 L V8 and heavy-duty battery. Pricing rose to $23,049 for Coupe de Ville, and $23,404 for Sedan de Ville.\n\nCadillac's main competition in this time frame continued to be Lincoln, which, alongside their successful Town Car, was now fielding an all-new front-wheel-drive Continental (based on the [[Ford Taurus]]). The [[Lincoln Continental#Eighth generation (1988\u201394)|Continental]] went into production with a six-cylinder engine so as to be considered a larger front-wheel-drive alternative to the [[Acura Legend#First generation (1986\u20131990)|Acura Legend]] that appeared in 1986, with a front-wheel-drive platform and a V6 engine.\n\n1989 introduced an extensive exterior redesign which included a longer 113.8-inch wheelbase for sedans. The {{Convert|155|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 4.5-liter powerplant (introduced just a year earlier), dashboard, and the front doors (on both the coupe and sedan) were about the only items that carried over \u2014 even the luggage compartment was over {{convert|2|cuft|m3}} larger than last year. The Coupe de Ville and Fleetwood coupe retained the previous year's interior, wheelbase, and doors\u2014all cleverly hidden between the new front and rear styling. A give-away to the previous design is the rear shelf package on the 2-door models. While the parcel shelf on the four-door models received a 'Mercedes-Benz inspired' storage compartment with lid, rear seat headrest panel, and a long 3-bulb horizontal brake lamp, the 2-door models still had the narrow carpeted parcel shelf and pedestal brake lamp from the previous year. Of special note were the composite (plastic) front fenders that resisted parking-lot dings and dents, and weighed less than their steel counterparts. Previously optional equipment that was made standard for 1989 included electrically powered outside mirrors and the AM/FM/cassette player stereo. New options introduced this year included a driver's side airbag, the [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] compact disc player, an electrically heated windshield, and a set of four reversible carpeted floor mats.\n\nFor 1990, DeVille and Fleetwood lost their telescopic steering column, but retained the tilt feature in exchange for an airbag mounted onto the newly standard leather-trimmed steering wheel. Engine output was up an additional {{convert|25|hp}} from sequential multi-port fuel injection. 1990 models also received GM's PASS Key theft-deterrent system which used a coded electronic pellet embedded into the ignition key. Other new features for 1990 included a non-illuminated vanity mirror on the driver's visor (a passenger side visor mirror had been standard equipment for decades now), door edge guards (previously optional), \"clam shell\" front center armrest with storage, and manual seat-back recliners for driver and passenger. While Lincoln's Continental did not fare well against DeVille, a new sales threat\u2014aimed directly at Cadillac\u2014came from the 1990 debut of [[Toyota]]'s [[Lexus LS400]] and the [[Infiniti Q45]] from Nissan.  Additionally, the [[Acura Legend]]\u2014[[Honda]]'s high-end label\u2014had been gaining momentum in the luxury market since its 1986 introduction.\n\nIn 1991, a {{Convert|200|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} 4.9-liter V8\u2014the largest of this type\u2014became the new standard powerplant.  Also new was a grille of an inverted trapezoid design (almost upside-down from last year's egg-crate keystone design), and revised bumper and body-side moldings.  The new grille held the familiar shape of the Cadillac crest itself\u2014a styling cue that continues to this day. The grille was now attached to the forward edge of the hood, and lifted up along with the hood when raised (similar to [[Mercedes-Benz]]). The secondary hood release latch was at the bottom of the grille instead of its previous location above the passenger side headlight. In addition to the new engine and minor front-end restyling, several previously optional features became standard this year, including the anti-lock braking system, accent striping, automatic door locks, Twilight Sentinel headlamp control, electrochromic inside rear-view mirror, and electric rear window and side mirror defogger. New standard features included rear-seat air conditioning vents, central door unlocking from the driver's door and luggage compartment, sun visors with shaded slide-out extensions, rear window lock-out switch, brake / transmission interlock safety switch, and an oil life indicator through the fuel data center. Other new features included the available remote keyless entry system, and the optional illuminated mirrors now featured a slide switch that offered variable intensity lighting. The first \"Deville Touring Sedan\" became available to the public on April 1, 1991. As a limited edition of only 1,500 produced for the 1991 model year,<ref>''Orlando Sentinel'' - \"Expert Reviews - 1991 Cadillac DeVille TS\" by Richard Truett dated August 8, 1991</ref> it was offered in 5 monochromatic paint schemes: Carmine Red; Cotillion White; Black; Dark Slate Gray metallic; and Black Sapphire Metallic. Larger 16\" x 6.5\" forged aluminum wheels with a wreath and crest center cap were fitted to P215/60R16 Goodyear GA all-season radial tires. A quicker 17:1 steering gear was also used. The specific Beechwood-color interior of the DeVille Touring Sedan had leather seating areas and revised seat design with integral lumbar support. Both driver and passenger seat featured six-way power seat adjusters and power recliners. This specific interior also featured American Walnut wood accents on the doors and instrument panel. A grill-mounted wreath and crest replaced the traditional stand-up hood ornament. Side door moldings feature \"TOURING SEDAN\" lettering and import style break-away outside rearview mirrors were painted body color. Revised sport door handles also are painted body color. The revised exterior also included a cloisonne deck lid lock cover similar to the STS and Eldorado Touring Coupe.<ref>Detroit Auto Show Press Release from Cadillac Motor Car Division dated January 7, 1991</ref>\n\nFor 1992, the Touring Sedan continued as a limited edition option. Besides the special features included in the initial 1,500 models from 1991, it featured on Touring Sedans, like other DeVille models, the \"Symphony Sound\" stereo with cassette was standard, while the optional [[Delco Electronics|Delco]]/[[Bose Corporation|Bose]] music system was available with cassette or single-slot CD player. Introduced for 1992, speed-sensitive suspension and traction control (both standard on Touring Sedan when introduced in '91) were available at extra cost on DeVille. Approximately 5,300 Touring Sedans were produced for 1992.<ref>Standard Catalog of American Cars 1976-1999 - 3rd ed. by Flammang & Kowalke. Krause publications 1999</ref>\n\n1993 saw few changes, as a brand-new replacement was coming for 1994. The previously optional speed-sensitive suspension, \"Computer Command Ride\", introduced last year became standard equipment, and now included a new speed-sensitive steering system as well. Minor trim changes were made including black-out trim in the grille (used on the 1992 Touring Sedan), and removing the chrome strip from the glass divider on the sedan's rear doors. 1993 would be the last year for the Coupe de Ville, which now came standard with the previously optional \"[[Cabriolet (carriage)|Cabriolet]]\" roof option (which covered the rear half of the roof in padded vinyl). Introduced as a prestige trim level of the Series 62 for the 1949 model year, Coupe de Ville's full-size 2-door body style had been declining in sales for several years, and as a result, the 1994 design went into production solely as a 4-door. Production ceased in July 1993. \n{{clear}}\n\n=== The final Coupe de Villes (1990\u20131993) ===\n[[File:Cadillac-Coupe-De-Ville-1991.jpg|thumb|left|1991 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\nCadillac built 17,507 Coupe de Villes and 2,429 Fleetwood coupes in 1990. The optional ''Cabriolet'' roof (standard on Fleetwood) appeared on 3,988 Coupe de Villes, while the available ''Phaeton'' roof was found on an additional 4,453 cars.  The ''Phaeton'' roof, re-creating the look of a convertible top, was included in the ''Spring Edition'' package (with 4,413 built), which also included perforated leather seat inserts among other items. The most popular color for 1990 was ''Cotillion White'', with 5,292 manufactured, while the least chosen color was ''Medium Dark Gray'', which found its way onto 193 cars that year. While all these two-door models wore the standard white-wall Michelin tires, this would be the last year for plain wheel covers on Coupe de Ville (found on 2,788 cars this year), as next year would feature a standard styled aluminum wheel (similar to the Fleetwood coupe). 479 two-door models were produced for export that year: 383 to Canada, 81 to Japan, and another 15 to Saudi Arabia. The 1990 Coupe de Ville was priced at $26,960, and the Fleetwood coupe at $32,400.<ref name=\"Flammang, James 1999\">Flammang, James ''Standard Catalog of American Cars 1976\u20131999 3rd Edition'' (Iola, WI: Krause Publications, Inc 1999)</ref>\n\nIn 1991 Cadillac manufactured 10,057 Coupe de Ville models, and an additional 597 Fleetwood coupes (of the 597 Fleetwood coupes, only 248 were equipped with the optional ''Custom Seating Package'' that included power back rest recliners for the front seats, and a 2-position ''Memory Seat'' function for the driver's seat). All of these cars were produced at GM's [[Orion Assembly]] plant in [[Orion, Michigan|Michigan]]. The total for both models with optional leather upholstery was 9,799 (with ''Dark Auburn'' being the least chosen interior color\u2014only 11 in leather and 2 in velour were ever made). The most popular exterior color for 1991 was ''Cotillion White'', with 2,967 models; while the least chosen color was ''Medium Dark Gray'', of which only 58 were manufactured. Of the 10,057 Coupe de Villes, 3,397 were ''Spring Edition'' models. The optional ''Cabriolet Roof'' with opera lamps (standard equipment on the Fleetwood coupe), which covered the rear-half of the roof in padded vinyl, was equipped on 1,729 Coupe de Villes, while an additional 3,952 carried the $1,095 ''Phaeton'' simulated convertible roof. The standard cassette stereo was found in nearly all models, while 1,122 opted for the [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] sound system at extra cost (752 with cassette, 370 with compact disc). Cadillac produced 164 of the 2-door models for export, including 126 to Canada, 23 to Japan, 5 to the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf countries]], 3 to [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], and the remaining seven to Europe. Pricing was $30,205 for Coupe de Ville, and $34,675 for Fleetwood coupe.<ref name=\"Flammang, James 1999\"/>\n\nFor 1992, Cadillac manufactured 6,980 Coupe de Ville models, and an additional 291 Fleetwood coupes (of the 291 Fleetwood coupes, only 128 were equipped with the optional ''Custom Seating Package'', a $425 option that included power back rest recliners for the front seats, and a two-position ''Memory Seat'' function for the driver's seat). All of these cars were produced at GM's [[Orion Assembly]] plant in [[Orion, Michigan|Michigan]]. The most popular color for 1992 was ''Cotillion White'', with 1,879 models; while the least chosen color was ''Mary Kay Pink'', of which only one was manufactured. Of the 6,980 Coupe de Villes, 2,635 were ''Spring Edition'' models. The ''Cabriolet Roof'' with opera lamps (a $925 option, and standard equipment on the Fleetwood coupe) which covered the rear-half of the roof in padded vinyl, was equipped on 3,572 Coupe de Villes, while an additional 3,319 carried the $1,095 ''Phaeton'' convertible-look roof. Only 89 standard painted-roof Coupe de Villes were made for 1992. Cadillac produced 144 of the two-door models for export, including 129 to Canada, and 15 to Japan. Pricing was $31,740 for Coupe de Ville, and $36,360 for Fleetwood coupe.<ref name=\"Flammang, James 1999\"/>\n\nWith the discontinuation of the Fleetwood coupe at the end of the 1992 model year, the 1993 Coupe de Ville was Cadillac's last six-passenger two-door car. The previously optional speed-sensitive suspension, \"Computer Command Ride\", introduced last year became standard equipment, and now included a new speed-sensitive steering system as well. Minor trim changes included black-out trim in the grille (as seen on the 1992 Touring Sedan). GM built 4,711 Coupe de Villes this year. The previously optional ''Cabriolet'' roof became standard equipment this year, and appeared on 3,606 cars. The ''Phaeton'' roof, which re-created the dashing look of a convertible top (now just a $170 option since the ''Cabriolet'' roof was standard equipment), was found on 1,105 cars. There were no painted-roof Coupe de Villes this year. Again, the most popular color for 1993 was ''Cotillion White'', with 1,147 manufactured, while the least chosen color was ''Dark Plum'', which found its way onto 24 cars this year. The four wheel choices this year included the standard-design cast aluminum wheel on 2,012 cars, optional $235 lace-design squeeze-case aluminum wheel on 1,766 cars, optional $235 locking wire wheel disc on 749 cars, and the $1,195 chromed squeeze-case aluminum wheel on 184 cars. Only 18 Coupe de Villes were ordered with the no-charge option of blackwall [[Michelin]] radial tires, the other 4,693 models wore the standard-equipment white-wall version. 3,036 had mono-tone paint, while the others held a lower body accent color, with the breakdown as follows: ''Silver'', 1,130; ''Dark Red'', 275; ''Gunmetal Gray'', 177; and ''Beige'', 93. In total, 4,168 had the standard Symphony Sound system, while 543 were ordered with the optional [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] stereo (310 with cassette, 233 with compact disc). Nearly all Coupe de Villes had leather upholstery (the most popular color was ''Neutral'', with 1,236 made), as only 239 velour interior models were manufactured this year (the least chosen cloth color was ''Taupe'', with only 24 manufactured). No Coupe de Villes were produced for export this year, and only 523 of the 4,711 built included California emission equipment. The base price of the 1993 Coupe de Ville was $33,915.<ref name=\"Flammang, James 1999\"/>\n\nThe declining popularity of full-size coup\u00e9s led to the discontinuation of the Coupe de Ville at the end of the 1993 model year. For 1994, the series comprised the following four-door models: DeVille and DeVille Concours.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Seventh generation (1994\u20131999) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Seventh generation\n| image        = 1994-1996 Cadillac Deville -- 01-28-2010.jpg\n| caption      = 1994\u20131996 Cadillac DeVille\n| model_years  = 1994\u20131999\n| aka          = Cadillac Concours (China)\n| assembly     = [[Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly]], [[Hamtramck, Michigan]], U.S.\n| body_style   = 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]\n| layout       = [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout#Front-engine transversely mounted .2F Front-wheel drive|Transverse front-engine, front-wheel drive]]\n| platform     = [[GM K platform (FWD)|K-body]]\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|2890|mm|in|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| length       = 1994\u201396: {{convert|209.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1997\u201399: {{convert|209.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width        = {{convert|76.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height       = 1994\u201396: {{convert|56.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1997\u201399: {{convert|56.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| weight       = {{convert|4000|-|4300|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n| engine       = 4.9&nbsp;L ''[[Cadillac High Technology engine#L26 4.9|L26]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]<br />4.6&nbsp;L ''[[Northstar engine series|Northstar]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 4-speed [[GM 4T60 transmission|4T60]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />4-speed [[GM 4T80 transmission|4T80]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| designer     = [[Chuck Jordan (automobile designer)|Chuck Jordan]]\n|related       = [[Cadillac Seville]]\n}}\n\n[[File:1994 Cadillac DeVille (04).jpg|thumb|left|1994\u20131996 Cadillac DeVille]]\n[[File:97-99 Cadillac DeVille.jpg|thumb|left|1997\u20131999 Cadillac DeVille]]\n\nFor 1994, the DeVille was redesigned to share the [[GM K platform (FWD)|K-body]] platform with the [[Cadillac Seville|Seville]]. The body was redesigned, although the wheelbase remained 113.8 inches\u2014rather than the 111 inches used on the Seville.  Production moved to [[Hamtramck, Michigan]].\n\nAlso for 1994, all DeVille models included a standard SRS driver-side front airbag, as well as fully digital instrumentation with integrated message center, which provided important vehicle information and status, current speed, outside temperature, and more, with controls mounted to the left of the instrument cluster. Also standard was a dual-zone front HVAC system, with controls located to the right of the instrument cluster, and remote controls on the front passenger door panel. A six-speaker audio system with A/M-F/M-Cassette stereo was standard, with an A/M-F/M-Cassette-CD stereo being optional equipment, as well as an eleven-speaker premium audio system. Premium cloth seating was standard, while luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces were available on all trim levels and standard on higher trim levels, both with full power adjustments. Front and rear bench seating for six passengers was standard equipment on most trim levels, while front bucket seats were optional. [[General Motors]]'s automatic lighting system, known as \"Twilight Sentinel\", was also standard equipment on all models. Controls for audio system, HVAC system, and cruise control were all mounted on the leather-wrapped, tilt-adjustable steering wheel. A SRS passenger's-side front airbag became standard equipment after a restyling in 1996, which also brought revised exterior styling and new audio systems with TheftLock coded anti-theft technology.\n\n{{anchor|Concours}}The ''DeVille Concours'' was available with the new 270&nbsp;hp (201&nbsp;kW) [[GM Premium V engine#LD8|''LD8'' Northstar]] [[V8 engine|V8]], while lesser models retained the ''[[Cadillac High Technology engine#L26 4.9|4.9L L26 V8]]'' until 1996. That year, the base model took on the lower-output Northstar while the Concours moved up to the high-output [[GM Premium V engine#L37|''L37'' Northstar]], with {{Convert|300|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}}.   The DeVille Concours replaced the previous generation's DeVille Touring Sedan.  The Concours introduced [[continuously variable road sensing suspension]] ([[CVRSS]]).\n\nThe DeVille received a facelift for the 1997 model year, and added the ''d'Elegance'' trim line to replace the [[Cadillac Fleetwood]].  The name was shortened from Sedan DeVille to simply DeVille. New headlights and a new grille were added, the rear wheel skirts were removed, the interior was redesigned, and the black/chrome trim was replaced by a double chrome trim in the base DeVille, chrome and gold trim and gold hood ornament on the d'Elegance, and chrome and body colored trim for the Concours. The Concours received real-time damping and [[Integrated Chassis Control System]] ICCS as standard. The interior gained a new dashboard design that hid the passenger airbag seams and new door panels with front side-airbags and the availability of [[OnStar]] system. Production of this generation ended in July 1999.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Model\n!Year\n!Engine\n!Power\n!Torque\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Base||1994\u20131995||4.9&nbsp;L ''[[Cadillac High Technology engine#L26 4.9|L26]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]||200&nbsp;hp (149&nbsp;kW) at 4100&nbsp;[[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]||275&nbsp;[[lb\u00b7ft]] (373&nbsp;N\u00b7m) at 3000&nbsp;rpm\n|-\n|1996\u20131999||4.6&nbsp;L [[GM Premium V engine#LD8|LD8 Northstar]] [[V8 engine|V8]]||275&nbsp;hp (205&nbsp;[[Kilowatt|kW]]) at 5750&nbsp;rpm||300&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft (407&nbsp;N\u00b7m) at 4000&nbsp;rpm\n|-\n|rowspan=3|Concours||1994||rowspan=2|4.6&nbsp;L [[GM Premium V engine#LD8|LD8 Northstar]] [[V8 engine|V8]]||270&nbsp;hp (201&nbsp;kW)||300&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft (407&nbsp;N\u00b7m)\n|-\n|1995||275&nbsp;hp (205&nbsp;kW) at 5750&nbsp;rpm||275&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft (373&nbsp;N\u00b7m) at 4750&nbsp;rpm\n|-\n|1996\u20131999||4.6&nbsp;L [[GM Premium V engine#L37|L37 Northstar]] [[V8 engine|V8]]||300&nbsp;hp (224&nbsp;kW) at 6000&nbsp;rpm||295&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft (400&nbsp;N\u00b7m) at 4400&nbsp;rpm\n|}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Eighth generation (2000\u20132005) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Eighth generation\n| image        = Cadillac Deville -- 10-30-2009.jpg\n| caption      = 2000\u20132005 Cadillac DeVille\n|production=August 1999-June 2005\n| model_years  = 2000\u20132005\n| assembly     = [[Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly]], [[Hamtramck, Michigan]], U.S.\n| body_style   = 4-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]]\n| layout       = [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout#Front-engine transversely mounted .2F Front-wheel drive|Transverse front-engine, front-wheel drive]]\n| platform     = [[GM G platform (FWD)|G platform]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Frame|first=Phil|title=GM H Cars  move to G Platform|url=http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19950116/ANA/501160730#axzz2TYYYR1jT|work=[[Automotive News]]|accessdate=17 May 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.autonews.com%2Fapps%2Fpbcs.dll%2Farticle%3FAID%3D%2F19950116%2FANA%2F501160730%23axzz2TYYYR1jT&date=2013-05-17|archivedate=17 May 2013|date=16 January 1995}}</ref>\n| related      = [[Cadillac Seville]]<br>[[Buick Riviera]]<br>[[Buick LeSabre]]<br>[[Buick Park Avenue]]<br>[[Oldsmobile Aurora]]<br>[[Pontiac Bonneville]]\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|115.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length       = {{convert|207.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width        = {{convert|74.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height       = {{convert|56.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| weight       = {{convert|3800|lb|kg||abbr=on}}\n| engine       = 4.6&nbsp;L ''[[Northstar engine series|Northstar]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 4-speed [[GM 4T80 transmission|4T80]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| designer     = [[Wayne Cherry]]\n}}\n\n[[File:2004 Cadillac DTS rear.jpg|thumb|left|2003\u20132005 Cadillac DeVille]]\nThe 2000 model year saw the first major redesign since 1994; this generation marked the move from the [[GM K platform (FWD)|K platform]] to the [[GM G platform (FWD)|G platform]]; despite this move [[General Motors|GM]] continued to refer to it as the K platform.<ref>{{cite web|last=Frame|first=Phil|title=GM H Cars move to G Platform|url=http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19950116/ANA/501160730#axzz2TYYYR1jT|work=[[Automotive News]]|accessdate=17 May 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.autonews.com%2Fapps%2Fpbcs.dll%2Farticle%3FAID%3D%2F19950116%2FANA%2F501160730%23axzz2TYYYR1jT&date=2013-05-17|archivedate=17 May 2013|date=16 January 1995}}</ref> Production started in August 1999.

An (unshortened) limousine or (in the United States) town car has a division between the passenger and driver compartments and if the driver's seat is outside it may be called a ''sedanca de ville'' or town car.<ref name=\"cadillacdatabase1\"/>\n\nThe first Cadillac \"Coupe de Ville\" was shown during the [[General Motors Motorama#1949|1949 Motorama]]. It was built on a [[Cadillac Sixty Special]] chassis and featured a dummy air-scoop, chrome trim around front wheel openings, and a one-piece windshield and rear glass. The interior was black and trimmed in gray leather, including the headliner, to match the roof color. It was equipped with a telephone in the glove compartment, a vanity case and a secretarial pad in the rear armrest, power windows and highly decorative chrome interior trim. The prototype \"Coupe de Ville\" was used by GM President Charles E. Wilson until 1957 when he presented it to his secretary. At some time during this period it acquired a dark [[Vinyl top|Vicodec roof]].

At $3,496 it was only a dollar less than the Series 62 convertible, and like the convertible, it came with power windows standard. It was luxuriously trimmed, with leather upholstery and chrome 'bows' in the headliner to simulate the ribs of a convertible top. In its first year the Series 62 Coupe de Ville only sold 2,150 units. But 1950 sales more than doubled to 4507, and in 1951 sales more than doubled again to 10,241 exceeding the sales for the Series 62 Club Coupe that year.

Given their sales success, it was only natural that the Coupe de Ville and Sedan de Ville were moved to their own separate series in 1959, the Series 6300, being joined by a DeVille convertible in 1964.<ref name=\"kowalke1997\"/><ref name=\"gunnell2005\"/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== First generation (1959\u20131960) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = First generation\n| image        = Cadillac Coupe de Ville, Weston Park Transport Show 2015 (16763492833).jpg\n| caption      = 1959 Cadillac Coupe de Ville\n| model_years  = 1959\u20131960\n| assembly     = [[Detroit Assembly]], [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], U.S.                 \n| platform     = [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]]\n| body_style   = 4-door 6-window [[hardtop]]<br>4-door 4-window [[hardtop]]<br>2-door [[hardtop]]\n| layout       = [[FR layout]]\n| engine       = {{convert|390|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine#390|OHV]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 4-speed [[Hydra-Matic]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|130.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"gunnell2005\"/>\n| length       = {{convert|225.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"gunnell2005\"/>\n| width        = 1959: {{convert|80.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"gunnell2005\"/><br>1960: {{convert|79.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"gunnell2005\"/>\n| height       = {{convert|56.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| weight       = {{convert|4900|-|5100|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n| designer     = [[Bill Mitchell (designer)|Bill Mitchell]]\n| related      = [[Cadillac Eldorado]]<br>[[Cadillac Sixty Special]]<br>[[Cadillac Series 62]]<br>[[Buick Electra]]<br>[[Oldsmobile 98]]\n}}\n\n[[File:Cadillac Sedan De Ville 1959.jpg|thumb|left|1959 Cadillac Sedan de Ville]]\n[[File:1959 Cadillac Coupe Deville3.jpg|thumb|left|1959 Cadillac Coupe de Ville (rear)]]\n[[File:1960 Cadillac DeVille (1).jpg|thumb|left|1960 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\n[[File:2007-07-15 1960 Cadillac Coupe de Ville IMG 2946.jpg|thumb|left|1960 Cadillac Sedan de Ville]]\n\nThe 1959 [[Cadillac]] is remembered for its huge sharp tailfins with dual bullet tail lights, two distinctive rooflines and roof pillar configurations, new jewel-like grille patterns and matching deck lid beauty panels.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1959_Cadillac/1959_Cadillac_Comparison_Folder/1959%20Cadillac%20Comparison%20Folder-04.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-24 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225010824/http://oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1959_Cadillac/1959_Cadillac_Comparison_Folder/1959%20Cadillac%20Comparison%20Folder-04.html |archivedate=2015-02-25 |df= }}</ref> In 1959 the [[Cadillac Series 62|Series 62]] were moved from the Series 62 to their own series, the '''Series 6200'''.  DeVilles and 2-door [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorados]] became the '''Series 6300''' and '''Series 6400''' respectively, though they all, including the 4-door Eldorado [[Cadillac Brougham|Brougham]] (which was moved from the '''[[Cadillac Series 70|Series 70]]''' to '''Series 6900'''), shared the same {{convert|130|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wheelbase. Engine output was an even 325&nbsp;hp (242&nbsp;kW) from the {{convert|390|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engine. The DeVille Series had script nameplates on the rear fenders. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, back-up lamps, windshield wipers, two-speed wipers, wheel discs, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror, oil filter, power windows and two-way power seats. Plain fender skirts covered the rear wheels and 4-doors were available in either four-window or six-window hardtop configurations. Over 53,000 DeVilles were sold in their first year as a separate series, accounting for roughly 37% of all Cadillacs sold.\n\nThe 1960 Cadillacs had smoother, more restrained styling. General changes included a full-width grille, the elimination of pointed front bumper guards, increased restraint in the application of chrome trim, lower tailfins with oval shaped nacelles and front fender mounted directional indicator lamps. DeVilles were distinguished by special script nameplates on the rear fenders. Four-window and six-window hardtop sedans were offered again. The former featured a one-piece wraparound backlight and flat-top roof, while the latter had a sloping rear window and roofline. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, dual back-up lamps, windshield wipers, two-speed wipers, wheel discs, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror, oil filter, power windows and a two-way power seats. Technical highlights were finned rear drums and an X-frame construction. Interiors were done in Chadwick cloth or optional Cambray cloth and leather combinations.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Second generation (1961\u20131964) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Second generation\n| image        = 1961 Cadillac six window Sedan Deville fvl.jpg\n| caption      = 1961 Cadillac Sedan de Ville\n| model_years  = 1961&ndash;1964\n| assembly     = [[Detroit Assembly]], [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], U.S.\n| body_style   = 4-door 6-window [[hardtop]]<br>4-door 4-window [[hardtop]]<br>4-door Town Sedan 6-Window [[hardtop]]<br>4-door Park Avenue 4-Window [[hardtop]]<br>2-door [[hardtop]]<br>2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|129.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"gunnell2005\"/>\n| length       = 1961\u201362 (except for Town Sedan or Park Avenue): {{convert|222.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"gunnell2005\"/><br>1961 Town Sedan: {{convert|215.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"gunnell2005\"/><br>1962\u201363 Park Avenue: {{convert|215.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"gunnell2005\"/><br />1963 (except for Park Avenue): {{convert|223.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"gunnell2005\"/><br />1964: {{convert|223.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"gunnell2005\"/>\n| layout       = [[FR layout]]\n| engine       = {{convert|390|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine#390|OHV]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>{{convert|429|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine#429|OHV]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 4-speed [[Hydra-Matic]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]]<br>3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#Super Turbine 400 / THM400 / 3L80 / 3L80HD|TH-400]], [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| width        = 1961: {{convert|79.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"gunnell2005\"/><br>1962: {{convert|79.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"gunnell2005\"/><br>1963: {{convert|79.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"gunnell2005\"/><br>1964: {{convert|79.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"gunnell2005\"/>\n| height       = 1961\u201362: {{convert|56.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1963\u201364: {{convert|56.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| weight       = {{convert|4700|-|4900|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n| designer     = [[Bill Mitchell (designer)|Bill Mitchell]]\n| related      = [[Cadillac Eldorado]]<br>[[Cadillac Sixty Special]]<br>[[Cadillac Series 62]]<br>[[Buick Electra]]<br>[[Oldsmobile 98]]\n}}\n\n[[File:1961 Cadillac Coupe Deville (09).jpg|thumb|left|1961 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\n[[File:1961 Cadillac Coupe Deville (14).jpg|thumb|left|1961 Cadillac Coupe de Ville steering wheel]]\n[[File:Cadillac sedan de Ville 1962 exhibited at Schaffen-Diest 2013.JPG|thumb|left|1962 Cadillac Sedan de Ville]]\n[[File:1963 Cadillac Coupe de Ville (1).jpg|thumb|left|1963 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\n[[File:Cadillac sedan rear -- 08-20-2009.jpg|thumb|left|Short-rear-decked 1963 Cadillac Sedan de Ville Park Avenue]]\n[[File:Cadillac De Ville convertible arriving Schaffen-Diest.JPG|thumb|left|1964 Cadillac DeVille convertible]]\n\nCadillac was restyled and re-engineered for 1961. The new grille slanted back towards both the bumper and the hood lip, along the horizontal plane, and sat between dual headlamps. New forward slanting front pillars with non-wraparound windshield glass were seen. The revised backlight treatment had crisp angular lines with thin pillars on some models and heavier semi-blind quarter roof posts on others. DeVille models featured front series designation scripts and a lower body \"skeg\" trimmed with a thin, three-quarter-length spear molding running from behind the front wheel opening to the rear of the car. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, dual backup lights, windshield washer, dual speed wipers, wheel discs, plain fender skirts, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror, oil filter, power windows and 2-way power seats. Rubberized front and rear coil springs replaced the trouble prone air suspension system. Four-barrel induction systems were now the sole power choice and dual exhausts were no longer available. A new short-decked four-door Town Sedan hardtop appeared mid-season.\n\nA mild facelift characterized Cadillac styling trends for 1962. A flatter grille with a thicker horizontal center bar and more delicate cross-hatched insert appeared. Ribbed chrome trim panel, seen ahead of the front wheel housings in 1961, were now replaced with cornering lamps and front fender model and series identification badges were eliminated. More massive front bumper end pieces appeared and housed rectangular parking lamps. At the rear tail lamps were now housed in vertical nacelles designed with an angled peak at the center. A vertically ribbed rear beauty panel appeared on the deck lid latch panel. Cadillac script also appeared on the lower left side of the radiator grille. The short-deck [[hardtop]] Town Sedan was moved from the DeVille series  to the Series 6200, being replaced by a short-deck Park Avenue.<ref>Flory, J. \"Kelly\", Jr. ''American Cars 1960\u20131972'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Coy, 2004), p.147.</ref> In addition all short deck Cadillac models went from being 6-window sedans in 1961 to 4-window sedans in 1962 and 1963. Standard equipment included all of last year's equipment plus remote controlled outside rearview mirror, five tubeless black wall tires, heater and defroster and front cornering lamps. Cadillac refined the ride and quietness, with more insulation in the floor and behind the firewall.<ref>Flory, p.147.</ref> DeVille sales as a separate series exceeded their sales level as a trim level for the first time ever at 71,883 units, or nearly 45% of Cadillac's total sales.\n\nCadillac was restyled again for 1963. Exterior changes imparted a bolder and longer look. Hoods and deck lids were redesigned. The front fenders projected 4.625 inches further forward than in 1962 while the tailfins were trimmed down somewhat to provide a lower profile. Body-side sculpturing was entirely eliminated. The slightly V-shaped radiator grille was taller and now incorporated outer extensions that swept below the flush-fender dual headlamps. Smaller circular front parking lamps were mounted in those extensions. A DeVille signature script was incorporated above the lower beltline molding near the rear of the body. A total of 143 options including bucket seats with [[wool]], [[leather]], or [[nylon]] upholstery fabrics and wood veneer facings on dash, doors, and seatbacks, set an all-time record for interior appointment choices. Standard equipment was the same as the previous year. The engine displacement and output remained the same, {{convert|390|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|325|hp|kW|abbr=on}}.<ref>Flory, p.211.</ref>\n\nA minor facelift followed in 1964. New up front was a bi-angular grille that formed a V-shape along both its vertical and horizontal planes. The main horizontal grille bar was now carried around the body sides. Outer grille extension panels again housed the parking and cornering lamps. It was the 17th consecutive year for the Cadillac tailfins with a new fine-blade design carrying on the tradition. Performance improvements including a larger V-8 were the dominant changes for the model run. Equipment features were same as in 1963 for the most part. Comfort Control, a completely automatic heating and air conditioning system controlled by a dial thermostat on the instrument panel, was introduced as an industry first. The engine was bumped to {{convert|429|cid|l|0|abbr=on}}, with 340&nbsp;hp (253.5&nbsp;kW) available. Performance gains from the new engine showed best in the lower range, at 20 to 50&nbsp;mph traffic driving speeds. A new technical feature was the Turbo-Hydramatic transmission, also used in the Eldorado and the Sixty Special. A DeVille script above the lower belt molding was continued as an identifier. This was the first year for the DeVille convertible. DeVille sales reached 110,379 units, accounting for nearly two thirds of all Cadillacs sold.\n{{-}}\n\n== Third generation (1965\u20131970) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Third generation\n| image        = 1965 Cadillac.jpg\n| caption      = 1965 Cadillac Sedan de Ville\n| model_years  = 1965\u20131970\n| assembly     = [[Detroit Assembly]], [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], U.S.   \n| layout       = [[FR layout]]\n| platform     = [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]]\n| engine       = {{convert|429|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine#429|OHV]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>{{convert|472|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine#472|OHV]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#Super Turbine 400 / THM400 / 3L80 / 3L80HD|TH-400]], [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|129.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"gunnell2005\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1965_Cadillac/1965_Cadillac_Brochure_1/1965%20Cadillac-21.html |title=Directory Index: Cadillac/1965_Cadillac/1965_Cadillac_Brochure_1 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019011410/http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1965_Cadillac/1965_Cadillac_Brochure_1/1965%20Cadillac-21.html |archivedate=2013-10-19 |df= }}</ref>\n| length       = 1965\u201367: {{convert|224.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1968: {{convert|224.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"gunnell2005\"/><br />1969\u201370: {{convert|225.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"gunnell2005\"/>\n|body_style    = 4-door [[hardtop]]<br>4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]<br>2-door [[hardtop]]<br />2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]\n| width        = 1965\u201368: {{convert|79.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1969\u201370: {{convert|79.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height       = 1965\u201368: {{convert|55.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1969\u201370: {{convert|56.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| weight       = {{convert|4600|-|4900|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n| designer     = [[Bill Mitchell (designer)|Bill Mitchell]]\n| related      = [[Cadillac Eldorado]]<br>[[Cadillac Calais]]<br>[[Buick Electra]]<br>[[Oldsmobile 98]]\n}}\n\n[[File:1965 Cadillac Coupe Deville.jpg|thumb|left|1965 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\n[[File:1965 Cadillac Deville convertible dashboard1.jpg|thumb|left|1965 Cadillac de Ville convertible (interior)]]\n[[File:1966 Cadillac Deville convertible right.jpg|thumb|left|1966 Cadillac de Ville convertible]]\n[[File:1967 Cadillac DeVille (16439709295).jpg|left|thumb|1967 Cadillac Sedan de Ville]]\n[[File:1968 Cadillac Coupe Deville fvl1.jpg|thumb|left|1968 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\n[[File:1969 Cadillac Sedan Deville fvl.jpg|thumb|left|1969 Cadillac Sedan de Ville]]\n[[File:CADILLAC DE VILLE CONV-782.JPG|thumb|left|1970 Cadillac DeVille convertible]]\n\nAs it had been since DeVille became a separate series, DeVille denoted Cadillac's mainstream model, falling between the [[Cadillac Calais|Calais]] (which had replaced the [[Cadillac Series 62|Series 62]]) and the [[Cadillac Sixty Special|Sixty Special]] and [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado]]. The DeVille was redesigned for 1965 but rode on the same {{convert|129.5|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase. Tailfins were canted slightly downward, and sharp, distinct body lines replaced the rounded look. Also new were a straight rear bumper and vertical lamp clusters. The headlight pairs switched from horizontal to vertical, thus permitting a wider grille. Curved frameless side windows appeared, and convertibles acquired tempered glass backlights. New standard features included lamps for luggage, glove and rear passenger compartments and front and rear safety belts. Power was still supplied by the 340 horsepower {{convert|429|CID|cc|abbr=on}} V8, which would be replaced by the {{convert|472|CID|cc|abbr=on}} for 1968. Perimeter frame construction allowed repositioning the engine six inches forward in the frame, thus lowering the transmission hump and increasing interior room. Pillared sedans appeared on the DeVille series for the first time, while six-window hardtop sedans were dropped. A padded vinyl roof was a $121 extra-cost option on the hardtop model. All four DeVille models had small \"Tiffany-like\" script nameplates on the ends of their rear fenders just above the chrome [[side molding]].\n\nIn 1966 changes included a somewhat coarser mesh for the radiator grille insert, which was now divided by a thick, bright metal horizontal center bar housing rectangular parking lamps at the outer ends. Separate rectangular side marker lamps replaced the integral grille extension designs. There was generally less chrome on all Cadillac models this year. DeVille scripts were still above the rear tip of the horizontal body rub moldings. Cadillac crests and V-shaped moldings, front and rear, were identifiers. Cadillac \"firsts\" this season included variable ratio steering and optional front seats with carbon cloth heating pads built into the cushions and seatbacks. Comfort and convenience innovations were headrests, reclining seats and an AM/FM stereo system. Automatic level control was available. Engineering improvements made to the perimeter frame increased ride and handling ease. Newly designed piston and oil rings and a new engine mounting system and patented quiet exhaust were used.\n\nThe 1967 DeVilles were extensively restyled. Prominent styling features were given a powerful frontal appearance with forward-leaning front end, long, sculptured body lines, and redefined rear fenders that had more than just a hint of tail fins in them. The full-width, forward-thrusted \"eggcrate\" grille was flanked by dual stacked headlights for the third consecutive year. The squarer cornered grille insert had blades that seemed to emphasize its vertical members and it appeared both above the bumper and through a horizontal slot cut into it. Rectangular parking lamps were built into the outer edges of the grille. Rear end styling revisions were highlighted by metal divided tail lamps and a painted lower bumper section. Coupe de Villes got a new roofline, inspired by the Florentine show car created for the 1964 [[New York City|New York]] World's Fair, that gave rear seat passengers added privacy. As on that show car, the quarter window glass retracted rearward into a sail panel. Minor trim variations and slightly richer interiors separated DeVille from [[Cadillac Calais|Calais]]. Tiffany style chrome signature scripts were again found above the body side molding on the rear fenders. New standard DeVille features included non-glare [[rear-view mirror]], electric clock, Automatic Climate Controls, padded dashboard, Hazard Warning system, outboard seatbelt retractors and rear cigarette lighters in all styles. A slide-out fuse box and safety front seat back lock for two-door models were additional Cadillac advances for the 1967 model year. Technical improvements included a revised engine valve train, different carburetor, Mylar printed circuit instrument panel, re-tuned body mounts, and a new engine fan with clutch for quieter operation.  A GM-designed Energy Absorbing steering column and safety wheel became standard for all models.\n\nIn 1968 grilles had an insert with finer mesh and step down outer section which held the rectangular parking lights just a little higher than before. Rear end styling was modestly altered with the deck lid having more of a rake. The most obvious change was an 8.5-inch-longer hood designed to accommodate recessed windshield wiper-washers, which now came with three speeds standard. Of 20 exterior paint color combinations, 14 were totally new. On the inside enriched appointments included molded inner door panels with illuminated reflectors and a selection of 147 upholstery combinations, 76 in cloth, 67 in leather and four in vinyl. New standard features included a Light Group, a Mirror Group, a trip odometer and an ignition key warning buzzer. The DeVille also gained a new {{convert|472|CID|cc|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]] engine rated at 375&nbsp;hp (SAE gross). 1968 was also the last year for the \"stacked\" dual headlights, which were replaced with side-by-side dual headlights in 1969. This was also the last year for vent windows.  Side marker lights in the rear bumper as well as\nfront fender were also added.  Side mirror changed from a round to rectangular shape.\nAlso of note front disc brakes were available starting in 1968.  Cars built after January 1, 1968 got front shoulder belts per Federal safety standards.\n\nIn 1969 DeVille was restyled in the Eldorado image. An Eldorado-like front fender treatment evolved and helped to emphasize a stronger horizontal design line. Rear quarters were extended to give the car a longer look. There was an all new grille with dual horizontal headlamps positioned in the outboard step down areas of the grille. The hood was again extended, a total of 2.5 inches to add the impression of extra length. The roofline was squarer and the rear deck and bumper more sculptured. A new ventilation system eliminated the need for vent windows, which provided a longer sleeker look and improved visibility. New standard features included front and rear (except on convertibles) center seat armrests.  The ignition switch was moved from the instrument panel to the steering column, and included a steering wheel and transmission lock, one year ahead of a mandated Federal standard.\n\nIn 1970 a facelift included  a grille with 13 vertical blades set against a delicately cross-hatched rectangular opening. The bright metal headlamp surrounds were bordered with body color to give it a more refined look. Narrow vertical \"vee\" tail lights were seen again, but now had additional smaller V-shaped bottom lenses pointing downward below the bumper. Wheel discs and winged crest fender tip emblems were new. Exterior distinctions came from a DeVille script above the rear end of the belt molding and from the use of long rectangular back up light lenses set into the lower bumper as opposed to the smaller square lens used on the Calais. A new feature was a body color border around the edge of the vinyl top covering, when this option was ordered. 1970 was the last year that DeVille offered a convertible body style, 1970 was also the last model year for pillared sedans until hardtops were permanently dropped in 1977.  A total of 181,719 DeVilles were sold for that model year, accounting for 76% of all Cadillacs.\n{{-}}\n\n== Fourth generation (1971\u20131976) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Fourth generation\n| image = 1973 Cadillac Sedan Deville.jpg\n| caption = 1973 Cadillac Sedan de Ville\n| model_years = 1971\u20131976\n| assembly = [[Detroit Assembly]], [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], U.S.<br />[[Linden, New Jersey]], U.S.\n| layout = [[FR layout]]\n| platform = [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|130.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| body_style = 4-door [[hardtop]]<ref>{{cite web |author=John Barach |url=http://www.100megsfree4.com/cadillac/cad1970/cad71d.htm |title=Cadillac history 1971 |publisher=100megsfree4.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-20 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100911104351/http://100megsfree4.com/cadillac/cad1970/cad71d.htm |archivedate=2010-09-11 |df= }}</ref><br>2-door [[hardtop]]<br>2-door [[coupe]]\n| engine = {{convert|472|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine#472|OHV]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br /> {{convert|500|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine#500|OHV]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#Super Turbine 400 / THM400 / 3L80 / 3L80HD|TH-400]], [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| length       = 1971: {{convert|225.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1972: {{convert|227.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1973: {{convert|227.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1974\u201376: {{convert|230.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width        = {{convert|79.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height       = 1971\u201373: {{convert|54.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1974: {{convert|54.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1975\u201376: {{convert|54.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| weight       = {{convert|4900|-|5400|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n| related      = [[Cadillac Calais]]<br>[[Buick Electra]]<br>[[Oldsmobile 98]]<br>[[Buick Estate]]<br>[[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser]]<br>[[Pontiac Grand Safari]]<br />[[Pontiac Safari]]<br />[[Chevrolet Kingswood]]<br/>[[Chevrolet Townsman]]\n| designer     = [[Bill Mitchell (designer)|Bill Mitchell]]\n}}\n\n[[File:1971 Cadillac Coupe Deville (17).jpg|thumb|left|1971 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\n[[File:Cadillac Coupe de Ville 1972 (5135993539).jpg|thumb|left|1972 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\n[[File:1973 Cadillac Coupe Deville (1).jpg|thumb|left|1973 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\n[[File:1973 Cadillac Coupe Deville (11).jpg|thumb|left|1973 Cadillac Coupe de Ville (interior)]]\n[[File:1974 Cadillac Coupe DeVille red.jpg|thumb|left|1974 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\n[[File:1974 Cadillac Coupe Deville rvl.jpg|thumb|left|1974 Cadillac Coupe de Ville (rear)]]\n[[File:1975 Cadillac Coupe Deville fvr.jpg|thumb|left|1975 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\n[[File:1976 Cadillac Coupe Deville (9459532865).jpg|thumb|left|1976 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\n\nAs with all GM full-size lines, the DeVille was completely redesigned for 1971. The new GM full-size bodies, at 64.3 inches front shoulder room (62.1 inches on Cadillac) and 63.4 inches rear shoulder room (64.0 inches on Cadillac) set a record for interior width that would not be matched by any car until the full-size GM rear-wheel-drive models of the early to mid-1990s. Pairs of individually housed squarish headlamps were set wider apart. The V-shaped grille had an eggcrate style insert and was protected by massive vertical guards framing a rectangular license plate indentation. A wide hood with full-length windsplints, a prominent center crease and hidden windshield wipers was seen. A Cadillac crest decorated the nose and new indicator lamps appeared atop each front fender. A horizontal beltline molding ran from behind the front wheel housing, almost to the rear stopping where an elliptical bulge in the body came to a point and where thin rectangular side markers were placed above and below the chrome strip. The rear wheel openings were again housed in fender skirts. Tail lamps were of the same type as before but were no longer divided by a chrome bar. Long horizontal back-up lamps were set in the bumper, on either side of a deeply recessed license plate housing. DeVilles were set apart visually by thin bright metal rocker panel steps and signature script on the front fenders bearing the series name. The bottoms of the rear fenders were decorated with a bright metal beauty panel that was wider than the rocker panel strips and blended into the molding running along the bottom of the fender skirt. The standard engine remained the [[Cadillac V8 engine#472|472]], still rated at 375 SAE gross horsepower and {{convert|525|lb\u00b7ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque.\nInteriors were redesigned, featuring a new curved instrument panel and new seating configurations. A rear \"lamp monitor\", a fiber-optic system which monitored the taillamps, turn signals and brake lights, was new and positioned on the shelf behind the rear seat.\n\nIn November 1971, a showroom-stock 1971 Coupe de Ville placed third in the annual coast-to-coast Cannonball Run, posting the highest average speed of the event, {{convert|84.6|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} (excluding stops) and averaging {{convert|8.9|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn 1972, a modest frontal revision placed more emphasis on horizontal grille blades. The parking lamps were moved from the bumper to between the square bezeled headlamps, which were now set wider apart. V-shaped emblems made a return on hood and deck lid. New standard features included a bumper impact system, automatic parking brake release, passenger assist straps and flow through ventilation system. New DeVille signature script was affixed to the sides of the rear roof panels. Sales reached a record 194,811.\n\nNew energy absorbing bumpers were seen on all GM cars in 1973 and it brought styling refinements to DeVille. Grilles were widened and had an intricate eggcrate design. Larger vertical rectangles housed the parking lamps between wide spaced headlamps which had square bezels but round lenses. Bumpers ran fully across the front and wrapped around each end. Vertical guards were spaced much further apart at a point outboard of the grille. The rear end had a bumper with a flatter upper section housing an angled license plate recess. Border outline moldings vertically \"veed\" paralleled the fender edge shape at the rear bodysides. Single horizontally mounted rectangular rear side marker lamps were placed over and under the rear tip of the thin beltline trim. Cadillac script was seen on the front fender sides below the belt molding behind the wheel opening.Inside, \"soft-pillow\" door panels with larger, sturdier pull-straps were new. The rear \"lamp monitor\" was repositioned from the rear seat shelf to the headliner just above the rear window. An Illuminated vanity mirror was an available option. This was the final year for hardtop Coupe de Villes, an irony since it was their introduction of the hardtop that made them such a sensation in 1949. Sales set a new record at 216,243.\n\nIn 1974, a wide eggcrate grille was used. Dual round headlamps were mounted close together in square bezels. Further outboard were double deck wraparound parking lamps. Shorter vertical grille guards appeared in about the same position as before. Rear fendersides were flatter without the elliptical bulge. The thin beltline molding was positioned lower by several inches. The rear end had vertical bumper ends with integrated side marker lights. New taillamps were positioned horizontally beneath the trunk lid. Both bumpers, especially the rear, protruded further from the body. Unlike the other \"C\" body GM coupes, the Coupe de Ville was no a longer true hardtop, instead sporting large wide \"coach\" windows giving a thick center pillar look. They retained their frameless door glass, however.  The Sedan de Ville continued as a true hardtop however, and would remain so until the 1977 model.  A new curved instrument panel housed a new quartz controlled digital clock. New standard features included an integral litter container. A Space Saver spare tire was standard when DeVilles were ordered with optional white sidewall steel belted radial tires.\n\n1974 also saw the introduction of the optional \"[[Air Cushion Restraint System]]\". Known today as airbags, this option provided protection for front seat occupants in the case of a frontal collision. One bag was located in the steering wheel, the other in the dashboard in front of the front seat passenger. The glove box was replaced with a lockable storage compartment under the dashboard. The option was expensive and therefore unpopular with customers and was discontinued after the 1976 model year. Cadillac would not offer airbags again until the 1990 model year.\n\nA new option package was a fully padded '''Cabriolet''' roof treatment. It incorporated a [[Landau (automobile)|landau]]-style top with bright metal forward divider strip. Another new option package was the '''d'Elegance''' package. Similar to the Sixty Special Brougham's package of the same name, it featured [[velour]] upholstery, Deluxe padded doors, front seatback storage pockets, deep pile carpeting, floor mats, see-through standup hood ornament and vinyl tape accent stripes. The \"d'Elegance\" name remained with the DeVille series as a package through 1984. For 1997, it became a separate model designation for the sedan.\n\nStyling changes for 1975 brought dual rectangular headlamp lenses flanked by rectangular cornering lights wrapped around squared-off front fenders. A new cross hatched grille also appeared, with Cadillac script on the header. Sedan's now featured thin opera windows set within the D-pillars. New standard equipment included front fender lamp monitors, power door locks, high energy ignition, steel-belted radial whitewall tires. The 210&nbsp;hp 500 V8 replaced the 472 as the standard engine. Electronic fuel injection became optional in March 1975. Another option was the Astroroof with sliding sunshade that permitted use as an electrically operated sunroof or a transparent closed skylight. An ordinary sunroof panel was also available. New hinged door pull handles replaced the old door pull straps for 1975 and 1976.\n\nIn 1976, the grille saw a new and finer crosshatching pattern. Cornering lamps received new horizontal silver trim; taillamp\nBezels also gained new chrome-like trim. Eight different color accent stripes were available. Vinyl tops were now integral padded Elk grain material. New trims included sporty plaids, plush velours, knits and 11 distinctive genuine leathers. Coupe de Villes had a new vinyl roof whose top molding served as a continuation of the door \"belt\" molding. A Controlled (limited-slip) Differential was included for extra traction. An optional illuminated entry and theft deterrence system was optional. The new [[ACDelco|Delco Freedom]] battery, never needed water added.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1976_Cadillac/1976%20Cadillac%20Full%20Line%20Brochure/image3.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-05-15 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509191541/http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Cadillac/1976_Cadillac/1976%20Cadillac%20Full%20Line%20Brochure/image3.html |archivedate=2018-05-09 |df= }}</ref> New turbine-vaned and wire wheel covers were offered. A new option locked the doors when the transmission lever was shifted to \"Drive\". Cadillac also offered Track Master, a computerized skid prevention system that automatically pumped the back brakes in an emergency to shorten stopping distance. New options included a push-button Weather Band built into the AM/FM stereo signal-seeking radio, loose pillow style seats for d'Elegance packages, plus power passenger and manual driver seatback recliners for 50/50 front seats. Of the 15 standard and six optional Firemist body colors, 13 were new this year. New standard features included Soft-Ray [[tinted glass]], spare tire cover, trunk mat, washer fluid level indicator, and steel belted radial whitewall tires.\n\nFrom 1975 to 1976 small numbers of Coupe de Villes were converted into car-based pick-ups, similar to a [[Chevrolet El Camino]], but much more upscale. Coachbuilding company Traditional Coach Works manufactured 204 of these, called the '''Cadillac Mirage''', to Cadillac's standards, such that one could be ordered through a participating Cadillac dealer.<ref name=Mirage1>[http://www.facereplace.com/mirage/History%20of%20the%20Cadillac%20Mirage.htm History of the Cadillac Mirage \u2013 facereplace.com]</ref> The floor bed could carry flat plywood 4 x 8 sheets with the tailgate closed, while the two-seat front cabin offered driver and passenger a plush ride. A storage area behind the seats was used for golf-clubs or small articles of value, out of view. A metal cover with a lock on it was available for the rear bed, just as a trunk would also have.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_kJlN_Sm0o Cadillac Mirage video review \u2013 The Drive]</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Fifth generation (1977\u20131984) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Fifth generation\n| image        = 1977 Cadillac Coupe Deville (01).jpg\n| caption      = 1977 Cadillac Coupe de Ville\n| production = 1977\u20131984\n| assembly     = {{ubl | [[Detroit Assembly]], [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] | [[Linden Assembly]], [[Linden, New Jersey]] | [[South Gate Assembly]], [[South Gate, California]] }}\n| designer     = [[Bill Mitchell (designer)|Bill Mitchell]]\n| body_style   = 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]<br>2-door [[coupe]]\n| platform     = [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]]\n| related      = [[Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham]]<br>[[Buick Electra]]<br>[[Oldsmobile 98]]\n| layout       = [[FR layout]]\n| engine       = {{ubl | {{convert|250|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac High Technology engine#HT-4100|''HT-4100'']] [[V8 engine|V8]] | {{convert|252|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V6 engine#LC4|''LC4'']] [[V6]] | {{convert|368|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine#368 and V8-6-4|''L62'']] V8 | {{convert|425|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Cadillac V8 engine#425|''L33/L35'']] V8 |{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Oldsmobile Diesel engine#LF9|''LF9'']] [[Diesel engine|diesel]] V8 }}\n| transmission = 3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#Super Turbine 400 / THM400 / 3L80 / 3L80HD|TH-400]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]<br>3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM350|TH-350C]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]<br>4-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM200-4R|TH-200-4R]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| wheelbase    = 1977\u201379: {{convert|121.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1980\u201382: {{convert|121.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1983\u201384: {{convert|121.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length       = 1977\u201379: {{convert|221.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1980\u201384: {{convert|221.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width        = {{convert|76.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height       = 1977: {{convert|57.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1978\u201384 4-door: {{convert|56.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>2-door: {{convert|54.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|weight        = {{convert|4000|-|4400|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\n[[File:Cadillac 1977 Sedan de Ville .jpg|thumb|left|1977 Cadillac Sedan de Ville]]\n[[File:1978 Cadillac Coupe DeVille (01).jpg|thumb|left|1978 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\n[[File:1977-1979 Cadillac Coupe de Ville front.jpg|thumb|left|1979 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\n[[File:1979 Cadillac Coup\u00e9 deVille.jpg|thumb|left|1979 Cadillac Coupe de Ville (rear)]]\n[[File:1980 Cadillac Coupe Deville fvl2.jpg|thumb|left|1980 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\n[[File:1980 Cadillac Sedan DeVille (14).jpg|thumb|left|1980 Cadillac Sedan de Ville]]\n[[File:1980 Cadillac Coupe Deville interier1.jpg|thumb|left|1980 Cadillac Coupe de Ville (interior)]]\n[[File:81 Cadillac Sedan de Ville V864.jpg|thumb|left|1981 Cadillac Sedan de Ville]]\n[[File:1982 Cadillac Coupe DeVille side view.jpg|thumb|left|1982 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\n[[File:1983 Cadillac Coup\u00e9 de Ville.jpg|thumb|left|1983 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\n[[File:Cadillac Sedan de Ville 2012-07-15 15-12-36.JPG|thumb|left|1984 Cadillac Sedan de Ville]]\n\n1977 was Cadillac's 75th anniversary, and saw the introduction of the downsized DeVille coupes and sedans. These new cars featured a higher roofline, resulting in a vehicle that was over nine inches shorter, four inches narrower, and 1/2 ton lighter than the previous year, but with a larger trunk and more headroom and legroom. These were also the first DeVilles ever to be marketed without [[fender skirts]] over the rear wheels. The old door pull straps returned for 1977 and on. The 500 in<sup>3</sup> V8 (which produced 190 horsepower) was replaced for 1977 by a 180-horsepower 425 in<sup>3</sup> V8 variant of similar design. The reduction in size and weight was implemented to improve fuel economy and emissions as a result of the United States Federal Government passage of [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] regulations.\n\nFor 1977, the lineup included the two-door Coupe de Ville ($9,654) and four-door Sedan de Ville ($9,864). The $650 d'Elegance package, an interior dress-up option carried over from the previous generation of DeVilles, continued for both models. 3-sided, wrap-around tail lamps were a 1977 feature only (although they would re-appear in 1987). Coupe de Ville's popular \"Cabriolet\" option, priced at $348, included a rear-half padded vinyl roof covering and opera lamps. An optional electronic fuel-injected version of the standard 7.0-liter powerplant, adding {{convert|15|hp}}, was available for an additional $647. Sales figures were 138,750 Coupe de Villes and 95,421 Sedan de Villes for an all-time sales record of 234,171 DeVilles sold.\n\nIn addition to a redesigned grille and hood ornament, 1978 saw slim, vertical tail lamps inset into chrome bumper end caps with built-in side marker lamps (Cadillac would retain this \"vertical tail lamp inset\" design feature on DeVille through 1984, and again from 1989 through 1999). New for 1978, a \"Phaeton\" package was optional for DeVille. Available on both coupe and sedan, the $1,929 Phaeton package featured a simulated convertible-top, special pin striping, wire wheel discs, and \"Phaeton\" name plates in place of the usual \"Coupe de Ville\" or \"Sedan de Ville\" ornament on the rear fenders. Inside were leather upholstered seats and a leather-trimmed steering wheel matching the exterior color. The package was available in \"Cotillion White\" (with Dark Blue roof), \"Platinum Silver\" (with a Black roof), or \"Arizona Beige\" (with a Dark Brown roof). Coupe de Ville's popular Cabriolet roof package was priced at $369, while the d'Elegance package (for coupe or sedan) was available at $689. Electronic [[fuel injection]], which added {{convert|15|hp}}, was available at $744. Electronic level control - which used suspension-mounted sensors and air filled rear shocks - kept the car's height level regardless of passengers and cargo weight, was available for $140. Sales dropped slightly from 1977 to 117,750 for the $10,444 Coupe de Ville, and 88,951 for Sedan de Ville, priced at $10,668.\n\nWith bigger changes coming in 1980, the 1979 models saw few alterations,  which included a new lightweight aluminum hood and a new grille design with \"Cadillac\" script on the header above the grille. The \"Phaeton\" package, now priced at $2,029, was still available in three colors, but with two new replacement colors: \"Western Saddle Firemist\" (with leather interior in \"Antique Saddle\") replacing the \"Arizona Beige\", and \"Slate Firemist\" (with leather interior in \"Antique Gray\") replacing \"Platinum Silver\". The d'Elegance package was back, at $725, which included Venetian velour upholstery (in four colors) with a 50/50 split front seat, overhead assist handles, Tangier carpeting, door pull handles, and \"d'Elegance\" emblems among other niceties. In addition to the $783 \"fuel-injection\" option, there was also the choice of a 350 in<sup>3</sup> LF9 diesel V8 (built by [[Oldsmobile]]) for $849. Coupe de Ville's cabriolet package, priced at $384, was available in 17 colors. Production rose slightly to 121,890 for Coupe de Ville ($11,728), and 93,211 for Sedan de Ville ($12,093).\n\n1980 saw a significant refresh, with a lower, more aerodynamic nose, higher tail end, and a heavier, more substantial appearance. The Phaeton option was discontinued, but the $1,005 d'Elegance package remained. The Coupe de Ville now wore full, bright side window surround moldings, whereas the sedan had body-color door frames with a thin chrome bead around the window opening (as used in 1977 - 1979). The chromed-plastic grille held a very diplomatic, [[Rolls-Royce (car)|Rolls-Royce]] inspired design, with thick vertical bars, featuring the 'Cadillac' script on the driver's side grille header. The grille cast for 1980 was used again for the 1989 to 1992 [[Cadillac Brougham]]. Late in the 1980 model year, V6 power (in the form of a 4-bbl 252 CID engine manufactured by [[Buick]]) was offered as a credit option. Cadillac had not offered an engine with fewer than 8 cylinders since 1914. The standard engine for 1980 was a new 368 CID (6.0 L) V8. Unlike the pre-1980 models, the rear window glass for both two- and four-door models was now the same, as the two-door models did away with the sporty slanted rear window and adopted the formal vertical look shared with the sedans. Pricing for DeVille was $12,899 for the coupe; $13,282 for the sedan. Sales dropped miserably for the 1980 model year, despite new sheetmetal and a multitude of improvements. Coupe de Ville was down to 55,490 (less than half of the 1979 figures), Sedan de Ville was also down by nearly half at 49,188. Oldsmobile's 5.7-liter diesel V8 was still available at $924, as was the popular Cabriolet option for Coupe de Ville at $350.\n\n1981's biggest news was the introduction of Cadillac's modulated-displacement 368 in<sup>3</sup> V8-6-4 engine.  Developed by the [[Eaton Corporation]] - with design elements that had been tested for over {{convert|500000|mi|km}} - allowed various engine computers to decide how many cylinders were needed to power the car for optimal fuel economy. The theory was 8 cylinders from a complete stop, 6 cylinders during usual driving, and just four cylinders at cruising speed. The changes in cylinder operation were seamless, and most drivers did not detect any difference in operation. However, in some cases, reliability and component failure led to customer complaints. Cadillac defended its micro-processor controlled powerplant, and even offered special extended warranties to customers. Also available was [[Oldsmobile]]'s 5.7-liter V-8 diesel engine. The {{convert|125|hp}} [[Buick]] V6, teamed with an automatic transmission, returned for 1981 after a short initial offering in the spring of 1980. Coupe de Ville was priced at $13,450, while Sedan de Ville, priced at $13,847, now had the unique option of an available automatic seat belt system - the first offered on a GM vehicle. With the automatic shoulder/lap belt system (only for the outboard front seat passengers), the shoulder point was moved from the upper B-pillar to the upper door glass frame, and the belt reel was moved from the floor onto the door itself, installed in the lower corner. With this, you could theoretically leave the seat belt latched at all times, and simply get in and out of the vehicle without having to unfasten the belt. The $150 option (which would re-appear as standard equipment on the 1990 - 1992 Brougham), was available only on V6-powered Sedan de Villes. The [[V6]] option itself was a $165 credit over the standard V8 in DeVille. A new grille design was made up of small squares, similar to the pattern from 1979, while the same chromed grille surround from 1980 continued. The egg-crate 1981 grille cast was used again for the 1987 and 1988 [[Cadillac Brougham]] models. A new Electronic Climate Control panel did away with the slide lever and thumb wheel in favor of a digital display which allowed the driver to set the interior temperature to a single degree - from 65 to 85 (or \"max\" settings at 60 and 90 degrees). Option groups included the $1,005 d'Elegance package (available on both models), and the Cabriolet package (for Coupe de Ville) at $363. Sales were up slightly from 1980: 89,991 sedans versus 62,724 coupes (figures include DeVille and Fleetwood models).\n\nChanges for 1982 were kept to a minimum, including a new thin vertical bar grille design (which was used through 1986) with the same grille surround from the past two years, and a new standard wheel cover design. Cadillac introduced a new aluminum-block 249-cubic-inch 4.1-liter HT series V8 engine to replace the V8-6-4. The new power plant featured a closed-loop digital fuel injection system, free-standing cast-iron cylinders within a cast-aluminum block, and was coupled with a 4-speed automatic-overdrive transmission. Other engine options included the Buick V6 or Oldsmobile's diesel V8. Inside, the Electronic Climate Control had an updated fascia that now included an \"Outside Temperature\" button. Previously, the outside temperature was available through an illuminated thermometer mounted to the driver's outside mirror. With the new front-drive Cadillac Cimarron taking over as Cadillac's entry-level model, the $15,249 Coupe de Ville was now a step-up. Sedan de Ville was priced at $15,699. Sales totals for 1982 included 50,130 coupes and 86,020 sedans (figures include DeVille and Fleetwood models).\n\nFor 1983, slight reworkings under the hood added 10 horsepower (now rated at 135) to the standard 4.1-liter powerplant. Meanwhile, the Buick V6 credit-option was dropped. The biggest visible change was hardly noticeable - while the grille design was a carry-over from the previous year (and would be through 1986), the Cadillac script moved from the chrome header onto the grille itself. The wide parking lamps below the quad headlamps now had clear frosted lenses (previous years they were amber), with satin gold-colored winged Cadillac emblems centered on each lens. A very minor change in the rear was the deletion of the chrome tips on both sides of the lower deck lid trim. These little chrome corner pieces, mounted on the filler panels, were prone to pitting as they were made of a different material than the bright aluminum trunk trim and upper license late surround. Coupe de Ville's popular Cabriolet roof package added $415 to its $15,970 sticker price. While both models, including the $16,441 Sedan de Ville, could be ordered with the $1,150 d'Elegance package. 1983 was supposed to be the last year for the rear-drive DeVille, as new front-drive models would take over for 1984. However, numerous developmental delays caused DeVille to stay in rear-drive form for another year. Sales figures looked healthy, with a total of 109,004 sedans and 65,670 coupes (figures include DeVille and Fleetwood models).\n\nBecause of a delay in production of the new front-drive DeVilles (which were now going to be 1985 models), 1984 was a rerun for the rear-wheel-drive Coupe de Ville ($17,140) and its four-door companion, the popular Sedan de Ville ($17,625). It would also be the last time DeVille used the \"V\" emblem below the Cadillac crest, as 1985 models and on would use the crest and wreath emblem - formerly a Fleetwood exclusive. Minor changes included new body-color side moldings and a revised exhaust system with a revamped catalytic converter. The diesel V8 was now available at no additional charge. While the optional d'Elegance package remained at $1,150, the Cabriolet option for Coupe de Ville went up to $420. For 1984, sales figures show a total four-door production of 107,920 units, and an additional 50,840 two-door units (figures include de Ville and Fleetwood models). The new front-drive 1985 Coupe de Ville and Sedan de Ville arrived in Cadillac showrooms during the Spring of 1984, about six months earlier than most new-car introductions, so both the 1984 rear-drive and 1985 front-drive models were selling and being produced (due to separate assembly plants) at the same time for nearly half a year.\n\n''' Size comparison between 1974 and 1977 Cadillac

Deville (02).jpg|thumb|left|1993 Cadillac Sedan de Ville]]\n\nFor the 1985 model year, the DeVille switched to GM's new FWD [[GM C platform (FWD)|C-body]] platform. A Fleetwood sedan variant was added to the mix at the start of production and shared the new [[front-wheel-drive]] platform and most dimensions with the DeVilles (the \"Fleetwood Brougham\" nomenclature remained on the rear-wheel-drive chassis through model year 1986 at which time the \"Fleetwood\" portion of the name was dropped and it became simply \"Brougham\" from 1987 through 1992).\n\nProduction of the new C-body commenced December 1983 at the [[Orion Assembly]] Plant in [[Orion Township, Michigan]]. A Fleetwood coupe version of the new FWD C-body joined the lineup later in the production run. The front cover of the brochure advertised the new cars as the \"Cadillac of Tomorrow\".  These new models were significantly smaller externally yet kept almost identical interior dimensions as their predecessors.  This change also brought nearly the entire Cadillac line of cars to front-wheel drive, leaving only the Fleetwood Brougham as the only rear-wheel-drive car offered by the division. Cadillac's [[Cadillac High Technology engine#HT-4100|HT-4100]] [[V8 engine|V8]] remained the standard engine, mounted transversely and coupled with a [[Turbo-Hydramatic 125#Turbo-Hydramatic 440-T4|440-T4]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]. Oldsmobile's 4.3L V6 diesel was optional. Of GM's front-drive C and H bodies, Cadillac was the only line to offer a V8 engine. The other GM vehicles were equipped with a Buick-derived 3.0 or 3.8 V6 engine, or - for 1985 only - Oldsmobile's 4.3L V6 diesel powerplant.\n\nThe 1985 DeVille was still available in [[sedan (car)|sedan]] or [[coupe]] form.  The d'Elegance package - an optional interior dress-up package featuring assist handles and button-tufted seating among other niceties - was no longer available on DeVille, but now offered solely on the Fleetwood sedan.  Thanks to an extended model year (starting April 1984), sales of the new downsized 1985 DeVille and Fleetwood models reached nearly 200,000 units.\n\nFor 1986, few changes marked the new DeVille's second year in production. An anti-lock braking system, developed by Teves, became available. A 2-position automatic rear-view mirror utilized two electronic 'eyes' and a small motor to dim when headlights appeared from behind. A factory-installed cellular telephone joined the option list at an astonishing $2,850. The standard space-saver spare tire now sat horizontally in the trunk, doing away with the small covered storage cubby in the spare tire well from last year. The optional aluminum wheels had new flush-fitting center caps (last year's design featured exposed capped lugs), and bumper rub strips changed from black to gray. Borrowed from the front-wheel-drive Fleetwood line, the narrow lower body side molding from the 1985 DeVille was replaced with a considerably wider one, and the trim surround from the rear window gave the formal appearance of a smaller window opening. Inside, a more tailored look was applied to the seat trim. Coupe de Ville's popular cabriolet option, featuring a padded vinyl covering over the rear half of the roof, was priced at $698. Along with the exterior changes made to 1986 DeVilles, adding the Cabriolet option made it difficult to distinguish a 1986 Coupe de Ville from the 1986 Fleetwood Coupe. Pricing for the Coupe de Ville was $19,669, with Sedan de Ville at $19,990. The transverse-mounted Cadillac 4.1-liter V-8 continued from the previous year, but with 5 more horsepower.\n\nThe 1986 Cadillac had:\nType: 90-degree, overhead valve V-8. Aluminum block and cast iron heads.\nDisplacement: 249 cu in (4.1 liters) \nBore & stroke: 3.47 x 3.31 in \nCompression ratio: 8.5:1 \nBrake horsepower: {{convert|135|hp|abbr=on}} at 4200 rpm \nTorque: 200&nbsp;lbf\u00b7ft (270 N\u00b7m) at 2200 rpm \nFive main bearings \nHydraulic valve lifters \nTBI \nVIN Code: 8\n\nIntroduced in 1986, Cadillac's Touring Sedan and Touring Coupe were based on the standard DeVille but included extras such as a subtle rear deck lid spoiler, body-color tail lamp bezels, front air dam with fog lamps, rear seat headrests, leather upholstery, and a performance enhancement package among other features. The package was available for $2,880. In addition, the Touring Coupe had removable decorative louvers on the rear edge of the side opera windows.\n\n1987 saw a new front-end design including revised cornering lamps in front and one-piece composite headlamps flanked a trapezoid-shaped grille with a bold egg-crate texture. Elongated fender caps were in back - upping the overall length by an inch and a half, but much more dramatic in appearance with new wrap-around tail lamps. This new 3-sided tail lamp style was inspired by a design used on the 1977 DeVille. Unlike the new one-piece headlamps, the changes to the rear-end in 1987 had little to do with engineering, but rather, feedback from Cadillac's customer base who felt the 1985-86 car looked too short. Although the 1987 revamp was still quite similar to the 1986 model (so much in fact that it still used the previous year's deck lid), the design was more in-tune with the look that traditional Cadillac buyers were used to.\n\nPricing for 1987 included Coupe de Ville at $21,316, and Sedan de Ville at $21,659.  Fleetwood d'Elegance at $26,104, and the new Fleetwood Sixty-Special was available for $34,850. The Touring option, priced at $2,880 over DeVille's base cost, also included aluminum wheels mounted on 15-inch Goodyear Eagle GT tires. At the end of the 1988 model year, Cadillac discontinued the slow-selling DeVille-based Touring Coupe and Sedan, although the 4-door would return in 1992.\n\nFor 1988, Cadillac kept cosmetic changes to a minimum in anticipation of the redesigned DeVille and Fleetwood models to come the following year.  To mitigate the nearly $2,000 price jump this year, several previously optional items were made standard equipment including tilt steering column, telescopic steering wheel, power trunk release, split-bench front seating, cruise control, and variable delay windshield wipers. Under the hood was a new 155&nbsp;hp 4.5 L V8 and heavy-duty battery. Pricing rose to $23,049 for Coupe de Ville, and $23,404 for Sedan de Ville.\n\nCadillac's main competition in this time frame continued to be Lincoln, which, alongside their successful Town Car, was now fielding an all-new front-wheel-drive Continental (based on the [[Ford Taurus]]). The [[Lincoln Continental#Eighth generation (1988\u201394)|Continental]] went into production with a six-cylinder engine so as to be considered a larger front-wheel-drive alternative to the [[Acura Legend#First generation (1986\u20131990)|Acura Legend]] that appeared in 1986, with a front-wheel-drive platform and a V6 engine.\n\n1989 introduced an extensive exterior redesign which included a longer 113.8-inch wheelbase for sedans. The {{Convert|155|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 4.5-liter powerplant (introduced just a year earlier), dashboard, and the front doors (on both the coupe and sedan) were about the only items that carried over \u2014 even the luggage compartment was over {{convert|2|cuft|m3}} larger than last year. The Coupe de Ville and Fleetwood coupe retained the previous year's interior, wheelbase, and doors\u2014all cleverly hidden between the new front and rear styling. A give-away to the previous design is the rear shelf package on the 2-door models. While the parcel shelf on the four-door models received a 'Mercedes-Benz inspired' storage compartment with lid, rear seat headrest panel, and a long 3-bulb horizontal brake lamp, the 2-door models still had the narrow carpeted parcel shelf and pedestal brake lamp from the previous year. Of special note were the composite (plastic) front fenders that resisted parking-lot dings and dents, and weighed less than their steel counterparts. Previously optional equipment that was made standard for 1989 included electrically powered outside mirrors and the AM/FM/cassette player stereo. New options introduced this year included a driver's side airbag, the [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] compact disc player, an electrically heated windshield, and a set of four reversible carpeted floor mats.\n\nFor 1990, DeVille and Fleetwood lost their telescopic steering column, but retained the tilt feature in exchange for an airbag mounted onto the newly standard leather-trimmed steering wheel. Engine output was up an additional {{convert|25|hp}} from sequential multi-port fuel injection. 1990 models also received GM's PASS Key theft-deterrent system which used a coded electronic pellet embedded into the ignition key. Other new features for 1990 included a non-illuminated vanity mirror on the driver's visor (a passenger side visor mirror had been standard equipment for decades now), door edge guards (previously optional), \"clam shell\" front center armrest with storage, and manual seat-back recliners for driver and passenger. While Lincoln's Continental did not fare well against DeVille, a new sales threat\u2014aimed directly at Cadillac\u2014came from the 1990 debut of [[Toyota]]'s [[Lexus LS400]] and the [[Infiniti Q45]] from Nissan.  Additionally, the [[Acura Legend]]\u2014[[Honda]]'s high-end label\u2014had been gaining momentum in the luxury market since its 1986 introduction.\n\nIn 1991, a {{Convert|200|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}} 4.9-liter V8\u2014the largest of this type\u2014became the new standard powerplant.  Also new was a grille of an inverted trapezoid design (almost upside-down from last year's egg-crate keystone design), and revised bumper and body-side moldings.  The new grille held the familiar shape of the Cadillac crest itself\u2014a styling cue that continues to this day. The grille was now attached to the forward edge of the hood, and lifted up along with the hood when raised (similar to [[Mercedes-Benz]]). The secondary hood release latch was at the bottom of the grille instead of its previous location above the passenger side headlight. In addition to the new engine and minor front-end restyling, several previously optional features became standard this year, including the anti-lock braking system, accent striping, automatic door locks, Twilight Sentinel headlamp control, electrochromic inside rear-view mirror, and electric rear window and side mirror defogger. New standard features included rear-seat air conditioning vents, central door unlocking from the driver's door and luggage compartment, sun visors with shaded slide-out extensions, rear window lock-out switch, brake / transmission interlock safety switch, and an oil life indicator through the fuel data center. Other new features included the available remote keyless entry system, and the optional illuminated mirrors now featured a slide switch that offered variable intensity lighting. The first \"Deville Touring Sedan\" became available to the public on April 1, 1991. As a limited edition of only 1,500 produced for the 1991 model year,<ref>''Orlando Sentinel'' - \"Expert Reviews - 1991 Cadillac DeVille TS\" by Richard Truett dated August 8, 1991</ref> it was offered in 5 monochromatic paint schemes: Carmine Red; Cotillion White; Black; Dark Slate Gray metallic; and Black Sapphire Metallic. Larger 16\" x 6.5\" forged aluminum wheels with a wreath and crest center cap were fitted to P215/60R16 Goodyear GA all-season radial tires. A quicker 17:1 steering gear was also used. The specific Beechwood-color interior of the DeVille Touring Sedan had leather seating areas and revised seat design with integral lumbar support. Both driver and passenger seat featured six-way power seat adjusters and power recliners. This specific interior also featured American Walnut wood accents on the doors and instrument panel. A grill-mounted wreath and crest replaced the traditional stand-up hood ornament. Side door moldings feature \"TOURING SEDAN\" lettering and import style break-away outside rearview mirrors were painted body color. Revised sport door handles also are painted body color. The revised exterior also included a cloisonne deck lid lock cover similar to the STS and Eldorado Touring Coupe.<ref>Detroit Auto Show Press Release from Cadillac Motor Car Division dated January 7, 1991</ref>\n\nFor 1992, the Touring Sedan continued as a limited edition option. Besides the special features included in the initial 1,500 models from 1991, it featured on Touring Sedans, like other DeVille models, the \"Symphony Sound\" stereo with cassette was standard, while the optional [[Delco Electronics|Delco]]/[[Bose Corporation|Bose]] music system was available with cassette or single-slot CD player. Introduced for 1992, speed-sensitive suspension and traction control (both standard on Touring Sedan when introduced in '91) were available at extra cost on DeVille. Approximately 5,300 Touring Sedans were produced for 1992.<ref>Standard Catalog of American Cars 1976-1999 - 3rd ed. by Flammang & Kowalke. Krause publications 1999</ref>\n\n1993 saw few changes, as a brand-new replacement was coming for 1994. The previously optional speed-sensitive suspension, \"Computer Command Ride\", introduced last year became standard equipment, and now included a new speed-sensitive steering system as well. Minor trim changes were made including black-out trim in the grille (used on the 1992 Touring Sedan), and removing the chrome strip from the glass divider on the sedan's rear doors. 1993 would be the last year for the Coupe de Ville, which now came standard with the previously optional \"[[Cabriolet (carriage)|Cabriolet]]\" roof option (which covered the rear half of the roof in padded vinyl). Introduced as a prestige trim level of the Series 62 for the 1949 model year, Coupe de Ville's full-size 2-door body style had been declining in sales for several years, and as a result, the 1994 design went into production solely as a 4-door. Production ceased in July 1993. \n{{clear}}\n\n=== The final Coupe de Villes (1990\u20131993) ===\n[[File:Cadillac-Coupe-De-Ville-1991.jpg|thumb|left|1991 Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]\nCadillac built 17,507 Coupe de Villes and 2,429 Fleetwood coupes in 1990. The optional ''Cabriolet'' roof (standard on Fleetwood) appeared on 3,988 Coupe de Villes, while the available ''Phaeton'' roof was found on an additional 4,453 cars.  The ''Phaeton'' roof, re-creating the look of a convertible top, was included in the ''Spring Edition'' package (with 4,413 built), which also included perforated leather seat inserts among other items. The most popular color for 1990 was ''Cotillion White'', with 5,292 manufactured, while the least chosen color was ''Medium Dark Gray'', which found its way onto 193 cars that year. While all these two-door models wore the standard white-wall Michelin tires, this would be the last year for plain wheel covers on Coupe de Ville (found on 2,788 cars this year), as next year would feature a standard styled aluminum wheel (similar to the Fleetwood coupe). 479 two-door models were produced for export that year: 383 to Canada, 81 to Japan, and another 15 to Saudi Arabia. The 1990 Coupe de Ville was priced at $26,960, and the Fleetwood coupe at $32,400.<ref name=\"Flammang, James 1999\">Flammang, James ''Standard Catalog of American Cars 1976\u20131999 3rd Edition'' (Iola, WI: Krause Publications, Inc 1999)</ref>\n\nIn 1991 Cadillac manufactured 10,057 Coupe de Ville models, and an additional 597 Fleetwood coupes (of the 597 Fleetwood coupes, only 248 were equipped with the optional ''Custom Seating Package'' that included power back rest recliners for the front seats, and a 2-position ''Memory Seat'' function for the driver's seat). All of these cars were produced at GM's [[Orion Assembly]] plant in [[Orion, Michigan|Michigan]]. The total for both models with optional leather upholstery was 9,799 (with ''Dark Auburn'' being the least chosen interior color\u2014only 11 in leather and 2 in velour were ever made). The most popular exterior color for 1991 was ''Cotillion White'', with 2,967 models; while the least chosen color was ''Medium Dark Gray'', of which only 58 were manufactured. Of the 10,057 Coupe de Villes, 3,397 were ''Spring Edition'' models. The optional ''Cabriolet Roof'' with opera lamps (standard equipment on the Fleetwood coupe), which covered the rear-half of the roof in padded vinyl, was equipped on 1,729 Coupe de Villes, while an additional 3,952 carried the $1,095 ''Phaeton'' simulated convertible roof. The standard cassette stereo was found in nearly all models, while 1,122 opted for the [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] sound system at extra cost (752 with cassette, 370 with compact disc). Cadillac produced 164 of the 2-door models for export, including 126 to Canada, 23 to Japan, 5 to the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf countries]], 3 to [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], and the remaining seven to Europe. Pricing was $30,205 for Coupe de Ville, and $34,675 for Fleetwood coupe.<ref name=\"Flammang, James 1999\"/>\n\nFor 1992, Cadillac manufactured 6,980 Coupe de Ville models, and an additional 291 Fleetwood coupes (of the 291 Fleetwood coupes, only 128 were equipped with the optional ''Custom Seating Package'', a $425 option that included power back rest recliners for the front seats, and a two-position ''Memory Seat'' function for the driver's seat). All of these cars were produced at GM's [[Orion Assembly]] plant in [[Orion, Michigan|Michigan]]. The most popular color for 1992 was ''Cotillion White'', with 1,879 models; while the least chosen color was ''Mary Kay Pink'', of which only one was manufactured. Of the 6,980 Coupe de Villes, 2,635 were ''Spring Edition'' models. The ''Cabriolet Roof'' with opera lamps (a $925 option, and standard equipment on the Fleetwood coupe) which covered the rear-half of the roof in padded vinyl, was equipped on 3,572 Coupe de Villes, while an additional 3,319 carried the $1,095 ''Phaeton'' convertible-look roof. Only 89 standard painted-roof Coupe de Villes were made for 1992. Cadillac produced 144 of the two-door models for export, including 129 to Canada, and 15 to Japan. Pricing was $31,740 for Coupe de Ville, and $36,360 for Fleetwood coupe.<ref name=\"Flammang, James 1999\"/>\n\nWith the discontinuation of the Fleetwood coupe at the end of the 1992 model year, the 1993 Coupe de Ville was Cadillac's last six-passenger two-door car. The previously optional speed-sensitive suspension, \"Computer Command Ride\", introduced last year became standard equipment, and now included a new speed-sensitive steering system as well. Minor trim changes included black-out trim in the grille (as seen on the 1992 Touring Sedan). GM built 4,711 Coupe de Villes this year. The previously optional ''Cabriolet'' roof became standard equipment this year, and appeared on 3,606 cars. The ''Phaeton'' roof, which re-created the dashing look of a convertible top (now just a $170 option since the ''Cabriolet'' roof was standard equipment), was found on 1,105 cars. There were no painted-roof Coupe de Villes this year. Again, the most popular color for 1993 was ''Cotillion White'', with 1,147 manufactured, while the least chosen color was ''Dark Plum'', which found its way onto 24 cars this year. The four wheel choices this year included the standard-design cast aluminum wheel on 2,012 cars, optional $235 lace-design squeeze-case aluminum wheel on 1,766 cars, optional $235 locking wire wheel disc on 749 cars, and the $1,195 chromed squeeze-case aluminum wheel on 184 cars. Only 18 Coupe de Villes were ordered with the no-charge option of blackwall [[Michelin]] radial tires, the other 4,693 models wore the standard-equipment white-wall version. 3,036 had mono-tone paint, while the others held a lower body accent color, with the breakdown as follows: ''Silver'', 1,130; ''Dark Red'', 275; ''Gunmetal Gray'', 177; and ''Beige'', 93. In total, 4,168 had the standard Symphony Sound system, while 543 were ordered with the optional [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] stereo (310 with cassette, 233 with compact disc). Nearly all Coupe de Villes had leather upholstery (the most popular color was ''Neutral'', with 1,236 made), as only 239 velour interior models were manufactured this year (the least chosen cloth color was ''Taupe'', with only 24 manufactured). No Coupe de Villes were produced for export this year, and only 523 of the 4,711 built included California emission equipment. The base price of the 1993 Coupe de Ville was $33,915.<ref name=\"Flammang, James 1999\"/>\n\nThe declining popularity of full-size coup\u00e9s led to the discontinuation of the Coupe de Ville at the end of the 1993 model year. For 1994, the series comprised the following four-door models: DeVille and DeVille Concours.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Seventh generation (1994\u20131999) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Seventh generation\n| image        = 1994-1996 Cadillac Deville -- 01-28-2010.jpg\n| caption      = 1994\u20131996 Cadillac DeVille\n| model_years  = 1994\u20131999\n| aka          = Cadillac Concours (China)\n| assembly     = [[Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly]], [[Hamtramck, Michigan]], U.S.\n| body_style   = 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]\n| layout       = [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout#Front-engine transversely mounted .2F Front-wheel drive|Transverse front-engine, front-wheel drive]]\n| platform     = [[GM K platform (FWD)|K-body]]\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|2890|mm|in|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| length       = 1994\u201396: {{convert|209.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1997\u201399: {{convert|209.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width        = {{convert|76.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height       = 1994\u201396: {{convert|56.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1997\u201399: {{convert|56.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| weight       = {{convert|4000|-|4300|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n| engine       = 4.9&nbsp;L ''[[Cadillac High Technology engine#L26 4.9|L26]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]<br />4.6&nbsp;L ''[[Northstar engine series|Northstar]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 4-speed [[GM 4T60 transmission|4T60]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />4-speed [[GM 4T80 transmission|4T80]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| designer     = [[Chuck Jordan (automobile designer)|Chuck Jordan]]\n|related       = [[Cadillac Seville]]\n}}\n\n[[File:1994 Cadillac DeVille (04).jpg|thumb|left|1994\u20131996 Cadillac DeVille]]\n[[File:97-99 Cadillac DeVille.jpg|thumb|left|1997\u20131999 Cadillac DeVille]]\n\nFor 1994, the DeVille was redesigned to share the [[GM K platform (FWD)|K-body]] platform with the [[Cadillac Seville|Seville]]. The body was redesigned, although the wheelbase remained 113.8 inches\u2014rather than the 111 inches used on the Seville.  Production moved to [[Hamtramck, Michigan]].\n\nAlso for 1994, all DeVille models included a standard SRS driver-side front airbag, as well as fully digital instrumentation with integrated message center, which provided important vehicle information and status, current speed, outside temperature, and more, with controls mounted to the left of the instrument cluster. Also standard was a dual-zone front HVAC system, with controls located to the right of the instrument cluster, and remote controls on the front passenger door panel. A six-speaker audio system with A/M-F/M-Cassette stereo was standard, with an A/M-F/M-Cassette-CD stereo being optional equipment, as well as an eleven-speaker premium audio system. Premium cloth seating was standard, while luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces were available on all trim levels and standard on higher trim levels, both with full power adjustments. Front and rear bench seating for six passengers was standard equipment on most trim levels, while front bucket seats were optional. [[General Motors]]'s automatic lighting system, known as \"Twilight Sentinel\", was also standard equipment on all models. Controls for audio system, HVAC system, and cruise control were all mounted on the leather-wrapped, tilt-adjustable steering wheel. A SRS passenger's-side front airbag became standard equipment after a restyling in 1996, which also brought revised exterior styling and new audio systems with TheftLock coded anti-theft technology.\n\n{{anchor|Concours}}The ''DeVille Concours'' was available with the new 270&nbsp;hp (201&nbsp;kW) [[GM Premium V engine#LD8|''LD8'' Northstar]] [[V8 engine|V8]], while lesser models retained the ''[[Cadillac High Technology engine#L26 4.9|4.9L L26 V8]]'' until 1996. That year, the base model took on the lower-output Northstar while the Concours moved up to the high-output [[GM Premium V engine#L37|''L37'' Northstar]], with {{Convert|300|hp|kW|-1|abbr=on}}.   The DeVille Concours replaced the previous generation's DeVille Touring Sedan.  The Concours introduced [[continuously variable road sensing suspension]] ([[CVRSS]]).\n\nThe DeVille received a facelift for the 1997 model year, and added the ''d'Elegance'' trim line to replace the [[Cadillac Fleetwood]].  The name was shortened from Sedan DeVille to simply DeVille. New headlights and a new grille were added, the rear wheel skirts were removed, the interior was redesigned, and the black/chrome trim was replaced by a double chrome trim in the base DeVille, chrome and gold trim and gold hood ornament on the d'Elegance, and chrome and body colored trim for the Concours. The Concours received real-time damping and [[Integrated Chassis Control System]] ICCS as standard. The interior gained a new dashboard design that hid the passenger airbag seams and new door panels with front side-airbags and the availability of [[OnStar]] system. Production of this generation ended in July 1999.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Model\n!Year\n!Engine\n!Power\n!Torque\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Base||1994\u20131995||4.9&nbsp;L ''[[Cadillac High Technology engine#L26 4.9|L26]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]||200&nbsp;hp (149&nbsp;kW) at 4100&nbsp;[[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]||275&nbsp;[[lb\u00b7ft]] (373&nbsp;N\u00b7m) at 3000&nbsp;rpm\n|-\n|1996\u20131999||4.6&nbsp;L [[GM Premium V engine#LD8|LD8 Northstar]] [[V8 engine|V8]]||275&nbsp;hp (205&nbsp;[[Kilowatt|kW]]) at 5750&nbsp;rpm||300&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft (407&nbsp;N\u00b7m) at 4000&nbsp;rpm\n|-\n|rowspan=3|Concours||1994||rowspan=2|4.6&nbsp;L [[GM Premium V engine#LD8|LD8 Northstar]] [[V8 engine|V8]]||270&nbsp;hp (201&nbsp;kW)||300&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft (407&nbsp;N\u00b7m)\n|-\n|1995||275&nbsp;hp (205&nbsp;kW) at 5750&nbsp;rpm||275&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft (373&nbsp;N\u00b7m) at 4750&nbsp;rpm\n|-\n|1996\u20131999||4.6&nbsp;L [[GM Premium V engine#L37|L37 Northstar]] [[V8 engine|V8]]||300&nbsp;hp (224&nbsp;kW) at 6000&nbsp;rpm||295&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft (400&nbsp;N\u00b7m) at 4400&nbsp;rpm\n|}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Eighth generation (2000\u20132005) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Eighth generation\n| image        = Cadillac Deville -- 10-30-2009.jpg\n| caption      = 2000\u20132005 Cadillac DeVille\n|production=August 1999-June 2005\n| model_years  = 2000\u20132005\n| assembly     = [[Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly]], [[Hamtramck, Michigan]], U.S.\n| body_style   = 4-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]]\n| layout       = [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout#Front-engine transversely mounted .2F Front-wheel drive|Transverse front-engine, front-wheel drive]]\n| platform     = [[GM G platform (FWD)|G platform]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Frame|first=Phil|title=GM H Cars  move to G Platform|url=http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19950116/ANA/501160730#axzz2TYYYR1jT|work=[[Automotive News]]|accessdate=17 May 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.autonews.com%2Fapps%2Fpbcs.dll%2Farticle%3FAID%3D%2F19950116%2FANA%2F501160730%23axzz2TYYYR1jT&date=2013-05-17|archivedate=17 May 2013|date=16 January 1995}}</ref>\n| related      = [[Cadillac Seville]]<br>[[Buick Riviera]]<br>[[Buick LeSabre]]<br>[[Buick Park Avenue]]<br>[[Oldsmobile Aurora]]<br>[[Pontiac Bonneville]]\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|115.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length       = {{convert|207.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width        = {{convert|74.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height       = {{convert|56.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| weight       = {{convert|3800|lb|kg||abbr=on}}\n| engine       = 4.6&nbsp;L ''[[Northstar engine series|Northstar]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 4-speed [[GM 4T80 transmission|4T80]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| designer     = [[Wayne Cherry]]\n}}\n\n[[File:2004 Cadillac DTS rear.jpg|thumb|left|2003\u20132005 Cadillac DeVille]]\nThe 2000 model year saw the first major redesign since 1994; this generation marked the move from the [[GM K platform (FWD)|K platform]] to the [[GM G platform (FWD)|G platform]]; despite this move [[General Motors|GM]] continued to refer to it as the K platform.<ref>{{cite web|last=Frame|first=Phil|title=GM H Cars move to G Platform|url=http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19950116/ANA/501160730#axzz2TYYYR1jT|work=[[Automotive News]]|accessdate=17 May 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.autonews.com%2Fapps%2Fpbcs.dll%2Farticle%3FAID%3D%2F19950116%2FANA%2F501160730%23axzz2TYYYR1jT&date=2013-05-17|archivedate=17 May 2013|date=16 January 1995}}</ref> Production started in August 1999.

When an upper-tier Regional level of government was created in 1969 to replace neighbouring [[Carleton County, Ontario|Carleton County]], the township was removed from Russell County and incorporated into the new [[Regional Municipality of Ottawa\u2013Carleton]].\n\nThe township comprised the eastern portion of the suburban [[Orl\u00e9ans, Ontario|Orl\u00e9ans]] area, and the communities of [[Bearbrook, [[Cumberland, Ottawa, Ontario (community)|Cumberland]] (a village with the same name as the township), [[Notre-Dame-des-Champs, Ontario|Notre-Dame-des-Champs]], [[Sarsfield, Ontario|Sarsfield]], [[Vars, Ontario|Vars]], [[Carlsbad Springs, Ontario|Carlsbad Springs]] and [[Navan, Ontario|Navan]].\n\nAlmost 200 years after it was first incorporated, Cumberland became a city in 1999.  City status was short-lived, however, as the municipality and all the other constituent municipalities (including the city of Ottawa) of the Regional Municipality of Ottawa\u2013Carleton were amalgamated in 2001, to form a single municipality \u2013 the new City of Ottawa.\n\nA memorial stands in front of St. Andrews United Church, dedicated to soldiers who lost their lives during the First and Second World Wars, as well as the Korean War.<ref>{{National Inventory of Canadian Military Memorials|id=2334|title=Cumberland war memorial: Memorial 35024-020 Ottawa (Cumberland), ON|access-date=8 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Cumberland Heritage Village Museum==\n\nThe Cumberland Heritage Village Museum, which depicts rural life in a village setting during the 1920s and 1930s, celebrated its 35th anniversary on September 25, 2011.

With an interest in exploring craft skills, he took courses at the local Buffalo [[YWCA]] craft program, where he later taught [[studio pottery|ceramic]] classes. He also took a few classes at the School for American Craftsmen (now the [[School for American Crafts]]) at the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]]; this interest led   to his membership in the organization Buffalo Craftsmen, where he served as president in 1962, and his active involvement with York State Craftsmen, a state organization that held an annual craft fair in [[Ithaca, New York]].\n\nHe took a position in the display department of the [[Flint & Kent]] department store in 1953, and was appointed Display Director there in 1955.<ref>A brief overview of Smith's early career can be found in Glenn Adamson, \u201cGatherings: Creating the Studio Craft Movement,\u201d in Jeannine Falino, ed., Crafting Modernism: Midcentury American Art and Design (New York: Abrams; Museum of Arts and Design, 2011), p. 41, as well as a biographical entry in the same text, p. 311\u201312.
