Initially depicted as a black silhouette of the game's other male ninja characters and sharing their moves, he would be given his own unique moveset and appearance in later games. His name consists of the surnames of ''Mortal Kombat'' creators [[Ed Boon]] and [[John Tobias]] spelled backwards.\n\nIn the storyline of the games, the character first appeared as [[Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)|Sub-Zero]] in [[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|the original 1992 game]], although this would not be established until 2004's ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deception]]''.<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat: Deception]]|developer=Midway Games |publisher=Midway Games|date=2004 |level=Noob Saibot/Smoke ending}}</ref>  As Noob Saibot, he debuted as an unplayable hidden character in ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'' (1993) and became a [[player character]] for the first time in the console versions of ''[[Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3]]'' (1996). His backstory establishes him as an undead wraith and member of the Brotherhood of the Shadow cult, which places him in the service of many of the series' villains.\n\nGeneral and critical reception to the character has been mainly positive, particularly in regard to his [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|Fatality]] finishing moves.\n\n==Creation and gameplay==\nThe character's name comes from the last names of the creators of the ''Mortal Kombat'' franchise, Ed Boon and John Tobias, spelled backwards.<ref name=\"name\">{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5800529/in-which-noob-saibot-lives-up-to-his-name |title=In Which Noob Saibot Lives Up to His Name |author= Mike Fahey |date=May 10, 2011 |website=Kotaku |accessdate=May 14, 2011}}</ref> During his first appearances, Noob Saibot's design was focused around an all-black exterior, with the staff stating \"that's what he's all about\".

He is colored black but he has Sub-Zero's frozen forearms and retains the latter's moves and Fatalities.\n\nAccording to [[Prima Games]], Noob Saibot is one of the most overpowered ''Mortal Kombat'' characters; they state \"he had an unblockable projectile attack, fought side-by-side with Smoke and even had ridiculous zoning in MK9.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.primagames.com/games/mortal-kombat-x/feature/cheapest-characters-mortal-kombat-history-part-2|title=Cheapest Characters in Mortal Kombat History: Part 2|work=Prima Games|accessdate=May 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n===In video games===\nPrior to becoming Noob Saibot, Bi-Han appears as [[Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)|Sub-Zero]] in the first ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' and the prequel ''[[Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero]]''. In ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'', his first appearance as Noob Saibot, it is revealed that he was killed by his nemesis [[Scorpion (Mortal Kombat)|Scorpion]] during the events of the first game and the identity of Sub-Zero is assumed by younger brother Kuai Liang in subsequent installments.\n\nIn ''[[Mortal Kombat 3]]'' and ''[[Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3]]'', Noob Saibot allies with evil Outworld emperor [[Shao Kahn]], but secretly observes the emperor at the behest of the Brothers of the Shadow. In ''Mortal Kombat 4,'' he serves the fallen Elder God Shinnok. ''[[Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition]]'' features Noob Saibot once again as a playable character, this time in the service of Shao Kahn. Noob Saibot leads an offensive against the forces of good and mortally wounds the Shokan prince Goro.\n\nIn ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deception]]'', Noob Saibot is free to forge his own destiny. Upon discovering him deactivated deep within Shao Kahn's palace, he reactivates and enslaves the cyborg ninja [[Smoke (Mortal Kombat)|Smoke]]. The wraith intends to use Smoke's body as the basis for his personal undead cyborg army.

In the game's story mode, he and Smoke invade the Lin Kuei ninja clan's castle, assimilating most of the defending Lin Kuei ninja and turning them into their own subordinate warriors. Noob Saibot and Smoke are eventually defeated by the warrior Taven, and Noob Saibot is left in the castle unconscious. Raiden then tries to force Noob Saibot to recall his past identity.\n\nIn the 2011 ''[[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' reboot, the past Raiden at the original Mortal Kombat tournament receives visions from his future counterpart. After one of the visions reveals Bi-Han's transformation into Noob Saibot, he tries to prevent Scorpion from murdering the first Sub-Zero by offering to ask the Elder Gods to resurrect the Shirai Ryu. This fails when Quan Chi manipulates Scorpion with a vision of Bi-Han murdering his family. After his death, he is subsequently resurrected by [[Quan Chi]] and serves as one of his enforcers.<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat: Deception]] |developer=Netherealm Studios |publisher=Midway |date=2011 |level=Chapter 14: Cyber Sub-Zero|quote=Sub-Zero: Bi-Han?! / Noob Saibot: Yes Kuai Lang.

Although he first appears during the second Mortal Kombat tournament, he does not receive a significant role until the Outworld invasion. He is sent to defend Quan Chi's Soulnado from Earthrealm's protectors. At some point before the Soulnado ritual starts, Kano warns Noob that the newly-cyberized Sub-Zero has broken free from Sektor's control. During the ritual in an Earthrealm cemetery, Noob confronts and disowns his younger brother, claiming \"We share blood. We are not brothers.\" He is defeated by Sub-Zero. Soon after, Noob Saibot engages Earthrealm warrior Nightwolf in the cemetery. Nightwolf overpowers the wraith and launches him into the Soulnado, dispelling the storm and seemingly killing Noob.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Mortal Kombat |developer=Netherealm Studios |publisher=Midway |date=2011 |level=Chapter 15: Nightwolf}}</ref>\n\nNoob Saibot returns in ''[[Mortal Kombat 11]]''. Despite his apparent death in the Soulnado, Noob mysteriously returns with amplified powers from the storm. Hiding in the shadows for years, Quan Chi's death in ''[[Mortal Kombat X]]'' frees Noob from enslavement. As Kronika, keeper of time, merges the past and present timelines, Noob pledges his allegiance to her in return for a dark clan of his own. Noob assists the time-displaced cyborg Sektor and the newly-indoctrinated Frost (Sub-Zero's former disciple) in kidnapping Lin Kuei clansmen and converting them into cyborg warriors. Noob and Frost attempt to stop the newly-allied Scorpion and Sub-Zero from foiling their plans for cyberization, but are defeated. Noob and Frost retreat with Sektor\u2019s deactivated body after the battle. Later, as Jacqui Briggs and her time-displaced father Jax arrive at Shang Tsung's temple to find Kronika's crown, Noob Saibot attempts to assassinate them. He is defeated, and both Jacqui and her father escape with the crown, but lost it due to interference from a reluctant present-Jax, whom Kronika had made her pawn. Noob does not appear again after this encounter, and his ultimate fate is unknown.<ref>{{Citation|last=GameSpot|title=Mortal Kombat 11 - Official Noob Saibot Reveal Trailer|date=2019-03-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUHjX8nD9FY|access-date=2019-03-23}}</ref> As revealed in Sub-Zero\u2019s ending, it was Sektor who had corrupted Bi-Han, even before he became Noob Saibot.\n\n===In other media===\nNoob Saibot (played by Kimball Uddin) made one appearance in the TV series ''[[Mortal Kombat: Konquest]]'' as an imprisoned Outworld warrior mistakenly released by Siro and Taja and then recruited by a sorceress to assassinate [[Kung Lao#Great Kung Lao|Kung Lao]].

His name consists of the surnames of ''Mortal Kombat'' creators [[Ed Boon]] and [[John Tobias]] spelled backwards.\n\nIn the storyline of the games, the character first appeared as [[Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)|Sub-Zero]] in [[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|the original 1992 game]], although this would not be established until 2004's ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deception]]''.<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat: Deception]]|developer=Midway Games |publisher=Midway Games|date=2004 |level=Noob Saibot/Smoke ending}}</ref>  As Noob Saibot, he debuted as an unplayable hidden character in ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'' (1993) and became a [[player character]] for the first time in the console versions of ''[[Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3]]'' (1996). His backstory establishes him as an undead wraith and member of the Brotherhood of the Shadow cult, which places him in the service of many of the series' villains.\n\nGeneral and critical reception to the character has been mainly positive, particularly in regard to his [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|Fatality]] finishing moves.\n\n==Creation and gameplay==\nThe character's name comes from the last names of the creators of the ''Mortal Kombat'' franchise, Ed Boon and John Tobias, spelled backwards.<ref name=\"name\">{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5800529/in-which-noob-saibot-lives-up-to-his-name |title=In Which Noob Saibot Lives Up to His Name |author= Mike Fahey |date=May 10, 2011 |website=Kotaku |accessdate=May 14, 2011}}</ref> During his first appearances, Noob Saibot's design was focused around an all-black exterior, with the staff stating \"that's what he's all about\".

He is colored black but he has Sub-Zero's frozen forearms and retains the latter's moves and Fatalities.\n\nAccording to [[Prima Games]], Noob Saibot is one of the most overpowered ''Mortal Kombat'' characters; they state \"he had an unblockable projectile attack, fought side-by-side with Smoke and even had ridiculous zoning in MK9.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.primagames.com/games/mortal-kombat-x/feature/cheapest-characters-mortal-kombat-history-part-2|title=Cheapest Characters in Mortal Kombat History: Part 2|work=Prima Games|accessdate=May 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n===In video games===\nPrior to becoming Noob Saibot, Bi-Han appears as [[Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)|Sub-Zero]] in the first ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' and the prequel ''[[Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero]]''. In ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'', his first appearance as Noob Saibot, it is revealed that he was killed by his nemesis [[Scorpion (Mortal Kombat)|Scorpion]] during the events of the first game and the identity of Sub-Zero is assumed by younger brother Kuai Liang in subsequent installments.\n\nIn ''[[Mortal Kombat 3]]'' and ''[[Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3]]'', Noob Saibot allies with evil Outworld emperor [[Shao Kahn]], but secretly observes the emperor at the behest of the Brothers of the Shadow. In ''Mortal Kombat 4,'' he serves the fallen Elder God Shinnok. ''[[Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition]]'' features Noob Saibot once again as a playable character, this time in the service of Shao Kahn. Noob Saibot leads an offensive against the forces of good and mortally wounds the Shokan prince Goro.\n\nIn ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deception]]'', Noob Saibot is free to forge his own destiny. Upon discovering him deactivated deep within Shao Kahn's palace, he reactivates and enslaves the cyborg ninja [[Smoke (Mortal Kombat)|Smoke]].

In the game's story mode, he and Smoke invade the Lin Kuei ninja clan's castle, assimilating most of the defending Lin Kuei ninja and turning them into their own subordinate warriors. Noob Saibot and Smoke are eventually defeated by the warrior Taven, and Noob Saibot is left in the castle unconscious. Raiden then tries to force Noob Saibot to recall his past identity.\n\nIn the 2011 ''[[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' reboot, the past Raiden at the original Mortal Kombat tournament receives visions from his future counterpart. After one of the visions reveals Bi-Han's transformation into Noob Saibot, he tries to prevent Scorpion from murdering the first Sub-Zero by offering to ask the Elder Gods to resurrect the Shirai Ryu. This fails when Quan Chi manipulates Scorpion with a vision of Bi-Han murdering his family.

Although he first appears during the second Mortal Kombat tournament, he does not receive a significant role until the Outworld invasion. He is sent to defend Quan Chi's Soulnado from Earthrealm's protectors. At some point before the Soulnado ritual starts, Kano warns Noob that the newly-cyberized Sub-Zero has broken free from Sektor's control. During the ritual in an Earthrealm cemetery, Noob confronts and disowns his younger brother, claiming \"We share blood. We are not brothers.\" He is defeated by Sub-Zero. Soon after, Noob Saibot engages Earthrealm warrior Nightwolf in the cemetery. Nightwolf overpowers the wraith and launches him into the Soulnado, dispelling the storm and seemingly killing Noob.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Mortal Kombat |developer=Netherealm Studios |publisher=Midway |date=2011 |level=Chapter 15: Nightwolf}}</ref>\n\nNoob Saibot returns in ''[[Mortal Kombat 11]]''. Despite his apparent death in the Soulnado, Noob mysteriously returns with amplified powers from the storm. Hiding in the shadows for years, Quan Chi's death in ''[[Mortal Kombat X]]'' frees Noob from enslavement. As Kronika, keeper of time, merges the past and present timelines, Noob pledges his allegiance to her in return for a dark clan of his own. Noob assists the time-displaced cyborg Sektor and the newly-indoctrinated Frost (Sub-Zero's former disciple) in kidnapping Lin Kuei clansmen and converting them into cyborg warriors. Noob and Frost attempt to stop the newly-allied Scorpion and Sub-Zero from foiling their plans for cyberization, but are defeated. Noob and Frost retreat with Sektor\u2019s deactivated body after the battle. Later, as Jacqui Briggs and her time-displaced father Jax arrive at Shang Tsung's temple to find Kronika's crown, Noob Saibot attempts to assassinate them. He is defeated, and both Jacqui and her father escape with the crown, but lost it due to interference from a reluctant present-Jax, whom Kronika had made her pawn. Noob does not appear again after this encounter, and his ultimate fate is unknown.<ref>{{Citation|last=GameSpot|title=Mortal Kombat 11 - Official Noob Saibot Reveal Trailer|date=2019-03-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUHjX8nD9FY|access-date=2019-03-23}}</ref> As revealed in Sub-Zero\u2019s ending, it was Sektor who had corrupted Bi-Han, even before he became Noob Saibot.\n\n===In other media===\nNoob Saibot (played by Kimball Uddin) made one appearance in the TV series ''[[Mortal Kombat: Konquest]]'' as an imprisoned Outworld warrior mistakenly released by Siro and Taja and then recruited by a sorceress to assassinate [[Kung Lao#Great Kung Lao|Kung Lao]].

Parliament]] who leads the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|Opposition]] party in the [[National Assembly (Mauritius)|National Assembly]]. This office is a constitutional one guaranteed by the laws of the country. The current office holder becomes automatically 7th in the order of precedence. The current Leader of the Opposition is [[Xavier-Luc Duval]] who was appointed by President [[Ameenah Gurib]] on December 20, 2016.\n\n==Overview==\nThe political party or party alliance which wins the majority of seats in Parliament forms the government and its leader usually becomes the [[Prime Minister of Mauritius|Prime Minister]]. The Prime Minister selects the members of the composition of the Cabinet from elected members of the Assembly, except for the Attorney General who may not be an elected member of the Assembly. The political party or alliance which has the second largest majority forms the Official Opposition and its leader is normally nominated by the [[President of Mauritius|President of the Republic]] as the Leader of the Opposition.<ref name=\"gov1\">{{cite

Gotti and his brothers grew up in poverty and turned to a life of crime at an early age. Gotti quickly became one of the crime family's biggest earners and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Gambino family [[underboss]] [[Aniello Dellacroce]], operating out of the [[Ozone Park, Queens|Ozone Park neighborhood]] of [[Queens]].\n\nEarly in his criminal career and following the [[FBI|FBI's]] indictment of members of Gotti's crew for selling narcotics, Gotti began to fear that he and his brother would be killed by Gambino boss [[Paul Castellano]] for selling drugs. As this fear continued to grow, and amidst growing dissent over the leadership of the crime family, Gotti organized the murder of Castellano in December 1985 and took over the family shortly thereafter, leaving Gotti as the boss of what has been described as America's most powerful crime syndicate, and one that made hundreds of millions of dollars a year from [[racketeering]], [[Truck hijacking|hijacking]], [[loan sharking]], [[drug trafficking]], [[bookmaking]], [[prostitution]], [[extortion]], [[pornography]], [[illegal gambling]] and other criminal activities.\n\nAt his peak, Gotti was one of the most powerful and dangerous crime bosses in the United States. During his era he became widely known for his outspoken personality and flamboyant style, which gained him favor with some of the general public. While his peers avoided attracting attention, especially from the media, Gotti became known as \"The Dapper Don\", for his expensive clothes and personality in front of news cameras. He was later given the nickname \"The [[Teflon]] Don\" after three high-profile trials in the 1980s resulted in his [[acquittal]], though it was later revealed that the trials had been tainted by [[jury tampering]], [[juror misconduct]], and [[witness intimidation]]. Law enforcement authorities continued gathering evidence against Gotti that helped lead to his downfall. According to [[Sammy Gravano]], Gotti earned between $5\u201320 million per year during his tenure as [[Gambino crime family|Gambino]] boss.<ref name=maas452/>\n\nGotti's underboss [[Sammy Gravano|Salvatore \"Sammy the Bull\" Gravano]] aided the FBI in finally convicting Gotti. In 1991, Gravano agreed to [[turn state's evidence]] and testify for the prosecution against Gotti after hearing the boss making several disparaging remarks about Gravano on a [[wiretap]] that implicated them both in several murders. In 1992, Gotti was convicted of five murders, [[conspiracy to commit murder]], [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|racketeering]], [[obstruction of justice]], [[tax evasion]], illegal gambling, extortion, and loansharking. He was sentenced to [[life imprisonment|life in prison]] without [[parole]] and was transferred to [[United States Penitentiary, Marion]] in southern Illinois.

Gotti and his brothers grew up in poverty and turned to a life of crime at an early age. Gotti quickly became one of the crime family's biggest earners and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Gambino family [[underboss]] [[Aniello Dellacroce]], operating out of the [[Ozone Park, Queens|Ozone Park neighborhood]] of [[Queens]].\n\nEarly in his criminal career and following the [[FBI|FBI's]] indictment of members of Gotti's crew for selling narcotics, Gotti began to fear that he and his brother would be killed by Gambino boss [[Paul Castellano]] for selling drugs. As this fear continued to grow, and amidst growing dissent over the leadership of the crime family, Gotti organized the murder of Castellano in December 1985 and took over the family shortly thereafter, leaving Gotti as the boss of what has been described as America's most powerful crime syndicate, and one that made hundreds of millions of dollars a year from [[racketeering]], [[Truck hijacking|hijacking]], [[loan sharking]], [[drug trafficking]], [[bookmaking]], [[prostitution]], [[extortion]], [[pornography]], [[illegal gambling]] and other criminal activities.\n\nAt his peak, Gotti was one of the most powerful and dangerous crime bosses in the United States. During his era he became widely known for his outspoken personality and flamboyant style, which gained him favor with some of the general public. While his peers avoided attracting attention, especially from the media, Gotti became known as \"The Dapper Don\", for his expensive clothes and personality in front of news cameras. He was later given the nickname \"The [[Teflon]] Don\" after three high-profile trials in the 1980s resulted in his [[acquittal]], though it was later revealed that the trials had been tainted by [[jury tampering]], [[juror misconduct]], and [[witness intimidation]]. Law enforcement authorities continued gathering evidence against Gotti that helped lead to his downfall. According to [[Sammy Gravano]], Gotti earned between $5\u201320 million per year during his tenure as [[Gambino crime family|Gambino]] boss.<ref name=maas452/>\n\nGotti's underboss [[Sammy Gravano|Salvatore \"Sammy the Bull\" Gravano]] aided the FBI in finally convicting Gotti. In 1991, Gravano agreed to [[turn state's evidence]] and testify for the prosecution against Gotti after hearing the boss making several disparaging remarks about Gravano on a [[wiretap]] that implicated them both in several murders. In 1992, Gotti was convicted of five murders, [[conspiracy to commit murder]], [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|racketeering]], [[obstruction of justice]], [[tax evasion]], illegal gambling, extortion, and loansharking. He was sentenced to [[life imprisonment|life in prison]] without [[parole]] and was transferred to [[United States Penitentiary, Marion]] in southern Illinois. According to former [[Lucchese crime family]] boss [[Anthony Casso|Anthony \"Gaspipe\" Casso]], \"What John Gotti did was the beginning of the end of ''[[American Mafia|Cosa Nostra]]''\".<ref>[[Philip Carlo]], ''Gaspipe: Confessions of a Mafia Boss'', 2008.

Gotti knew that it would be too risky to solicit support from the other four bosses, since they had longstanding ties to Castellano.

A train is being loaded with hundreds of bars of gold, guarded by several armed police officers.  (Railroad buffs will note that the locomotive is identical to the unique one used by the Twentieth Century Limited beginning in 1938.)  Further ahead, in a passenger coach, [[Lois Lane]] boards with help from [[Clark Kent]], who says he wishes he could come, but he has another story to cover.  As the last of the gold is loaded, a car a few hundred yards away turns on its lights, and the men inside put on robbers' masks and arm themselves.  The mysterious car follows the train.\n\nLater, a few of the robbers board the train from the back, climb to the middle, and separate several cars carrying guards from the front, leaving them stranded.  Two other robbers attack the locomotive, throwing the engineer and a guard overboard, but falling off themselves as well.  Lois, hearing the commotion, climbs to the engine's cab and is immediately machine-gunned from the robber's car, keeping pace with the train to the side.  Lois grabs the machine gun and returns fire, only to have the bullets bounce harmlessly off of the armored car.  The train continues to speed down the track, completely out of Lois' control and continually followed by the robbers.  A stationmaster notices this when the train does not stop at the next station, and sends out a telegraph as signalmen change the warning lights to red, and for a railroad drawbridge to close. Finally, Clark hears the news report through the Planet's telegraph, and discreetly enters the building's storage room, changing into his Superman costume.\n\nHe arrives on the scene just as the robbers have forced the train onto a track leading to a boxcar filled with explosives.  Superman manages to rip the track from the ground and guide the train back to its main course.  The robbers then demolish a bridge further ahead, causing the train to fall.  Superman catches the train and places it back on the track. Finally, the robbers had been throwed a massive, dangerous silver-colored, rocket-shaped bomb into the steam engine's boiler.  Superman manages to pull Lois out just before the boiler explodes and both the locomotive and its tender car derail and crash to the ground below the bridge.  Superman catches the lead car as it begins to roll backwards, and pulls the train up the hill himself, only to have the robbers toss several cans of [[tear gas]] at him.  Coughing, Superman momentarily loses control, but regains it, marching steadily up the hill despite the robbers' continued machine gun fire.\n\nSuperman pulls the train at full speed over several miles before bringing it to a safe stop at the US Mint.  The ''Daily Planet'' reports the successful delivery of the money and the capture of the robbers.
