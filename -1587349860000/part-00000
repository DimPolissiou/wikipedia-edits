While all speedruns aim for quick completion, some speedruns are characterized by additional goals or limitations that players subject themselves to, such as collecting all key items or playing blindfolded. Players speedrun mainly to challenge themselves, to entertain and to compete with themselves and others. Players performing speedruns, called speedrunners, often record their attempts. These recordings are used to entertain others, to verify the completion time, to certify that all rules were followed, and to spot ways to further improve the completion time.{{refn|group=Note|name=DemoFormat|Although many speedruns are released as video recordings, which are often preferred due to being more universal,  some communities use a game's native demo recordings (such as the <tt>DEM</tt> format in by ''Quake'') since these are much more compact and easier to share with others. Such recordings require specific software to view, usually a version of the original game. Some communities release speedruns in both formats so that they become accessible to a larger audience.}}\n\nTo achieve a high level of play, speedrunners often have to reason about the game differently from the way that ordinary players might. Speedruns usually follow [[gameplay]] routes that are planned out carefully before they are attempted. Many games have opportunities to disarrange the intended sequence of events and skip entire parts of it \u2014 often called [[sequence breaking]] \u2014 and many more have programming mistakes, or [[glitch]]es, that a skillful player can exploit to their advantage. [[Tool-assisted speedrun]]ning is a type of speedrunning in which various computer tools are used to obtain performances which would be near-impossible for a human player, and are not held in competition with speedruns done by human players in real time, known as real-time speedruns.\n\nSome games are considered to be particularly suited to speedrunning and have [[virtual community|online communities]] dedicated to them, which can provide an active platform for discussing, publishing, and improving speedruns. Speedruns can be viewed on a variety of platforms, including [[Streaming media|live streams]] where players can carry out and share their attempts in real-time. Although speedrunning was originally not a widespread phenomenon, it has since grown to involve several active websites and an increasingly expansive assortment of speedrun videos that are freely and widely circulated on the Internet.\n\n== Glitches and sequence breaking ==\n{{main|Glitch|Sequence breaking}}\nWhile routing, it becomes apparent that some of the goals in the game do not need to be achieved for completion. Such elements include [[cutscene]]s that need to be watched before the player can progress, items that the player needs to possess in order to continue to a next stage or even entire parts of the gameplay that may convey a part of the game's plot or a subplot. Skipping a part of the game in such a fashion that it can be described as disjointed with the game's intended/common sequence of events is referred to as ''sequence breaking''.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/sekiro-speedrunners-discover-wild-techniques-to-beat-th-1833720570|title=Sekiro Speedrunners Discover Wild Techniques To Beat The Game In 40 Minutes|website=Kotaku|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> A particularly effective form of sequence breaking is a \"credits warp\", a name for a sequence break which can teleport the player to the game's ending credits, examples of which can be found in ''[[Super Mario World]]''<ref name=\"PC MAG arbitrary code\">{{cite magazine|last=Murphy|first=David|date=2015-01-22|title=Speedrunner 'Beats' Super Mario World in Under 5 Minutes|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2475640,00.asp|magazine=PC Magazine}}</ref><ref name=\"Ars\">{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/01/how-an-emulator-fueled-robot-reprogrammed-super-mario-world-on-the-fly/|title=How an emulator-fueled robot reprogrammed Super Mario World on the fly|last=Orland|first=Kyle|date=2014-01-14|website=Ars Technica}}</ref> and ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/speedrunners-shatter-ocarina-of-time-world-record-by-wa-1841045682|title=Speedrunners Shatter Ocarina of Time World Record By Warping Into The Credits|website=Kotaku|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\nThe term ''sequence break'' was first used in 2003 in an online [[Internet forum|discussion forum]] thread concerning the [[GameCube|Nintendo GameCube]] game ''[[Metroid Prime]]''.{{refn|group=Note |name=OldMetroidTopics|Metroid 2002, a major Metroid speedrunning website, has retained back-ups of these topics that can be found at <tt>[http://www.metroid2002.com/home.php http://www.metroid2002.com/home.php]</tt>.

Thardus, a fictional creature in the [[Metroid|''Metroid'' series]], was designed to be a mandatory [[Boss (gaming)|boss]] before the Gravity Suit and Ice Beam could be obtained, hence the novelty of bypassing the boss while still obtaining the items. Since its initial discovery, sequence breaking has become an integral part of speedrunning and has been applied to many other games. A specific way to do sequence breaking in a specific game is usually called a skip, and well-known skips are known in their communities under names that easily identify it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/zelda-wind-waker-hd-speedrunning-community-spurred-by-new-exploit-484384.phtml|title=Zelda: Wind Waker HD speedrunning community spurred by new exploit|website=Destructoid|language=english|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> \n\n[[Image:Sm64 mips.png|thumb|Usage of a [[Speedrun#Glitches|glitch]] in ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' to pass through a wall, performing a sequence break.]]\n\n[[Glitch|Glitches]] are often{{Refn|Some sequence breaks are not considered glitches, due to the method(s) used to achieve them being within the bounds of what is considered \"glitchless\".<ref name=\"ExploitvGlitch\" />|name=OftenNote|group=Note}} used in order to achieve sequence breaks, as well as for other purposes, such as achieving otherwise impossible speed,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2015/05/half-life-2-world-record-speedrun-will-make-your-head-spin/|title=Half-Life 2 World Record Speedrun Will Make Your Head Spin|date=2015-05-06|website=Kotaku Australia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/inside-the-wild-speedrunning-community-of-16-year-old-spongebob-battle-for-bikini-bottom/|title=Inside the wild speedrunning community of 16-year-old SpongeBob: Battle for Bikini Bottom|last=Winkie|first=Luke|date=2019-09-25|website=PC Gamer|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> damage output,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/doom-eternal-speedrun-world-record-squeezes-under-40-minutes/|title=Doom Eternal speedrun world record squeezes under 40 minutes|last=Davenport|first=James|date=2020-03-30|website=PC Gamer|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> or skipping cutscenes.<ref name=\":2\" /> An example of a glitched sequence break can be found in the \"16 Star\" run of ''[[Super Mario 64]]''.

Some glitches, however, are still not allowed even in glitched categories. For example, it is typically agreed that glitches arising from outside the game, such as improperly inserting the [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]], are impermissible. Removing or altering a game disc/cartridge/files while the game is running is forbidden. Examples of this are the crooked cartridge trick in [[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]] and the CD streaming trick in [[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess]].<ref>{{cite web|title=ZeldaSpeedRuns Leaderboard Rules|url=http://zeldaspeedruns.com/leaderboards/rules|website=ZeldaSpeedRuns|access-date=September 1, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916220003/http://zeldaspeedruns.com/leaderboards/rules|archive-date=September 16, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Tool-assistance ==\n{{main|Tool-assisted speedrun}}\nAlthough most speedruns assume normal human play of a game, ''[[tool-assisted speedrun]]s'' (abbreviated ''TAS'') allow authors to use outside tools to aid their playing. For example, utilizing the [[Saved game#Save states|save state]] function of an [[Video game console emulator|emulator]] to go back in time and revise mistakes (known as ''re-recording''), or using software to read [[Variable (computer science)|variables]] directly from the game's memory, giving the player information not normally available to them. The result is that human limitations, such as skill and reflex, are no longer a barrier in the creation of a run; tool-assisted runs have (sometimes significantly) lower completion times than their unassisted equivalents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/speedrunner-smashes-a-computer-assisted-super-mario-bro-1834457319|title=Speedrunner Smashes A Computer-Assisted Super Mario Bros.

These categories usually include completing or avoiding specific aspects of the game and/or not allowing certain glitches or game exploits to be used in the run. An example of this would be the medallions/stones/trials category in ''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time''; this category requires the runner to beat all major levels in the game and restricts some of the glitches that can be performed. In ''[[Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!|Donkey Kong Country 3]]'', there is a \"Water%\" run, which constitutes collecting every DK Coin in the game; this requires the player to collect every Bear Coin to access the Lost World, but does not require a player to actually 100% the game and ignore the Banana Birds.<ref name=\"DKCspeedruns\">{{cite web|url=https://dkcspeedruns.com/Leaderboards#DKC3_-_Water.25|title=water% definition|accessdate=June 19, 2016}}</ref>{{Better source needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Randomizers ==\n{{Anchor|Randomizer}}\nA '''randomizer''' is a type of [[game mod]] that has been used in speedrunning, wherein software is used to shuffle the locations of elements (such as items) to provide an additional challenge. Popular games used for randomizer runs have included ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]'' and ''[[Super Metroid]]'', while a notable mod combines both games\u2014with special doorways transitioning the player between them, and items from both games scattered within their respective environments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/12/how-randomizers-are-breathing-new-life-into-old-games/|title=How \u201crandomizers\u201d are breathing new life into old games|last=Staff|first=Ars|date=2019-12-03|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us|access-date=2019-12-06}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nHistorically, speedruns have been performed by members of [[Virtual community|online communities]] pertaining to video games in general. When the activity became popular enough to accede to [[subculture]], the first sites dedicated to speedrunning started appearing\u2014usually specializing in just one or a few games. Some of these sites have sustained activity for a long time, sometimes even up to today, providing coverage of its members' achievements and serving as a platform for related discussions.\n\n=== COMPET-N (Doom) ===\nDecember 1993 saw the release of [[id Software]]'s ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', which allowed players to record demo files of their playthrough. The feature was first picked up by Christina \"Strunoph\" Norman in January 1994 when she launched the ''LMP Hall of Fame'' website.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\">{{cite web|url=https://www.doomworld.com/10years/demos/demos01.php|title=A Brief DOOM Demo History|author=Merrill, D.|year=2003|website=|publisher=Doomworld|accessdate=October 16, 2005}}</ref>\n\nThis site was, however, quickly followed up by the ''DOOM Honorific Titles'' (also known as the \"DHT\"),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fms27/dht/dht6.html|title=Doom Honorific Titles|last=|first=|date=|website=Doom Honorific Titles|accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref> launched in May 1994 by Frank Stajano, which introduced the first serious competition between players.<ref name=\"SmashingTheClock\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3142599&did=1|title=Smashing the Clock|author=Turner, B.|year=2005|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=August 13, 2005}}</ref> This site, designed around a notion of earning titles by successfully recording a particular type of demo on one of the predetermined maps in the \"[[Doom WAD|IWADs]]\", would create the basis for all ''Doom'' demo sites that would follow.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> These so-called \"exams\" became very popular as the player had to earn each title by submitting a demo of the feat to one of the site's judges to justify his application. ''[[Doom II|Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'' was released in October 1994,<ref name=\"Origins\">{{cite web|url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1994|title=1994 - Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts and Design, List of Winners|accessdate=2009-06-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080614193353/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1994 |archivedate = June 14, 2008}}</ref> and the DHT conformed to the new additions as well as the new ''Doom'' version releases. At the height of its popularity, the DHT had many different categories and playing styles.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> For example, playing with only the in-game fists and pistol, while killing all monsters on a map, became known as \"Tyson\" mode, named after the heavyweight boxer and former champion [[Mike Tyson]]. \"Pacifist mode\" was playing without intentionally harming any monsters. Each category had \"easy\", \"medium\", and \"hard\" difficulty maps for players to get randomly chosen for. As an authentication method to prevent players from submitting demos made by other people, it was required that they performed a distinct \"dance\" during their demo (often at the very beginning). With such varied categories, the DHT was appealing to a diverse group of players.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> However, the DHT had trouble retaining a permanent Internet location. This, combined with the constantly changing rules and the diminished importance of most of the titles, caused public interest to wane as the years went by.\n\nIn November 1994, the definitive installment ''Doom'' speedrunning scene, in the form of the COMPET-N website, was launched.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> Its creator, Simon Widlake, intended the site to be a record scoreboard for a variety of ''Doom''-related achievements, but unlike its predecessors, they were all based on the idea of fast completion, thus making it the first actual speedrunning site. Players were challenged to run through ''Doom''<nowiki/>'s levels as fast as humanly possible in order to attain a spot on the constantly updated COMPET-N scoreboards, leading to demo material gradually amounting to hundreds of hours of recorded gameplay.<ref name=\"DoomStats\">{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.doom2.net/~compet-n/database/cn.cgi | title = COMPET-N Database | publisher = Doom2.net | accessdate = October 28, 2016 | archivedate = April 12, 2014 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140412062105/http://www.doom2.net/~compet-n/database/cn.cgi | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nLike the DOOM Honorific Titles, this site experienced multiple location changes over time; it was hosted on the ''[[Simtel]]'' servers for a while, before Istvan Pataki took over as maintainer and moved the site to a now defunct [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] server of the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics|Technical University of Budapest]].

Despite being released as early as 1996, ''Quake'' has steadily remained popular with its players, who subsequently released the ''Quake done Quick with a Vengeance'' movie on September 13, 2000, which featured a complete run through ''Quake'' in 0:12:23.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/qdqwav.html |accessdate=March 25, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423162351/http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/qdqwav.html |archivedate=April 23, 2006 |title=Quake done Quick with a Vengeance}}</ref> Primarily tricks that had not been used in both its predecessors allowed for this improvement, as the run's manual states that it \"[makes] use of every known trick, including unrestricted [[Strafe-jumping|bunny-hopping]], to represent the state-of-the-art in Nightmare running\".<ref name=\"QuakeDoneQuickWithAVengeance\">{{cite web | year = 2000 | url = http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/qdqwav.txt | publisher = Quake done Quick | title = Quake done Quick with a Vengeance | author = Quake done Quick contributors | archivedate = April 9, 2006 | accessdate = October 28, 2016 | url-status = bot: unknown | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060409151532/http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/qdqwav.txt | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nAs of September 2014, Speed Demos Archive can be found at the web address <tt>[http://speeddemosarchive.com/ http://speeddemosarchive.com/]</tt> and contains a total amount of 9535 demos (on both official and custom maps), accounting for a total time of over 250 hours.<ref name=\"QuakeStats\">{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = https://archive.org/details/Quake_SDA_collection | title = Quake (PC) \u2013 Speed demo collection | publisher = Internet Archive | accessdate =September 10, 2014}}</ref> In December 2011, a new run was produced and called ''Quake done Quickest''.

As is the case for the rest of the games in the series, highly [[nonlinear gameplay]] makes it possible for runners to search extensively for different routes towards the end of the game. In particular, the ability to perform sequence breaking has been researched thoroughly, leading to the discovery of ways to complete the games while obtaining only a small percentage of items. Prior to the inception of Metroid speedrunning, there were special websites which documented these so-called \"low-percentage\" completion possibilities.\n\nThe first game to be exceedingly popular with the speedrunning audience was ''[[Super Metroid]]'', released in 1994, which proved to lend itself to fast completion purposes very well.<ref name=\"SmashingTheClock\"/> It featured a physics system that allowed for a wide array of skills for mobility, like \"wall jumping\" or the \"Shinespark\", allowing players to skip over large areas of the game, or play through the game in different manners based on how well they can perform these tricks in contextual situations. Additionally, it had the same nonlinear gameplay as its predecessors. Due to the way the game was laid out, several different run types or tiers that incorporate different completion percentages have been performed,{{refn|group=Note |name=TierFooter|A \"tier\", in this context, is a certain time-related goal that determines the strategy or route used in a speedrun. For example, a low-percentage speedrun is in a different tier than an any-percentage speedrun, as both have different completion goals.}} including any%, 100%, low%, and reverse boss order (RBO), in which the player beats the game's bosses in the opposite order they were meant to be played via sequence breaking.\n\nAs the Internet became more available to the general public, groups of players started collaborating on [[Internet forum|message boards]] to discuss these tricks with one another in what became a community based on playing the games speedily.\n\nThe first ''Metroid'' community that was created for the purpose of fast completion was ''Metroid Prime Discoveries'', created and led by Jean-Sebastien \"Zell\" Dubois.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://membres.lycos.fr/zellmetroid/|title=Lycos.com|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410072328/http://membres.lycos.fr/zellmetroid/|archivedate=April 10, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Rather than being a site that focused on speedrunning, it was dedicated to documenting the possibilities of sequence breaking in the game ''[[Metroid Prime]]''.

Players first started recording these special demos when Andy \"Aurican\" Kempling released a modified version of the ''Doom'' [[source code]] that made it possible to record demos in slow motion and in several sessions. A couple of months afterwards, in June 1999, the first site made for the purpose of sharing these demos, aptly called \"Tools-Assisted Speedruns\", was opened by Esko Koskimaa, Peo Sjoblom, and Yonatan Donner.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/>{{refn|group=Note |name=ToolsAssistedSpeedrun|Doom tool-assisted speedrunning is sometimes referred to as \"tools-assisted speedrunning\", after the first site used to share these demos.

I'm not going to redo the logo though.\"}}\n\nLike other such communities, the maintainers of the site stressed that their demos were for entertainment purposes rather than skill competitions, although the attempt to have the fastest time possible with tools itself became a competition as well.<ref name=\"AboutToolsAssistedSpeedruns\">{{cite web | year = 2000 | url = http://doomworld.com/tas/about.html | publisher = Internet Archive | title = Information about Tools-Assisted Speedruns | author = Koskimaa, E. | author2 = Sjoblom, P. | author3 = Donner, Y. | accessdate = April 8, 2006 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20000411175100/http://doomworld.com/tas/about.html | archivedate = April 11, 2000 | url-status = dead | df = mdy-all }}</ref> The site became a success, usually updating several times a week with demos recorded by its maintainers and submitted by its readers.

Although it was widely believed that the video was made by an extremely skilled player, it was actually the first tool-assisted speedrun made with a special emulator to generate widespread interest.{{refn|group=Note |name=EarlyTASVideos|There is evidence that several tool-assisted speedrun videos had been made before then, including a few others by Morimoto himself, but the Super Mario Bros. 3 video was the first to become popular with a general audience.}} When Morimoto detailed the making of the run on his website,<ref name=\"MorimotoExplanation\">{{cite web | year = 2003 | url = http://soramimi.egoism.jp/emu.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20031203222907/http://soramimi.egoism.jp/emu.htm | archivedate = December 3, 2003 | title = emu | publisher = Internet Archive | author = \u3082\u308a\u3082\u3068 | accessdate =December 3, 2003}}</ref> many felt deceived and turned to criticizing the video's \"illegitimacy\" instead. The knowledge that the video was constructed through tedious and careful selective replaying also raised some questions about the authenticity of video game replays; after all, if it is practically impossible to tell the videos of both kinds apart, one cannot possibly know whether a run was made with or without the use of a special emulator. It was even feared that this fact would cause the downfall of competitive speedrunning.<ref name=\"SmashingTheClock\"/> Neither the Speed Demos Archive nor Metroid 2002 have ever published runs that were known to be made with a special emulator.

While all speedruns aim for quick completion, some speedruns are characterized by additional goals or limitations that players subject themselves to, such as collecting all key items or playing blindfolded. Players speedrun mainly to challenge themselves, to entertain and to compete with themselves and others. Players performing speedruns, called speedrunners, often record their attempts. These recordings are used to entertain others, to verify the completion time, to certify that all rules were followed, and to spot ways to further improve the completion time.{{refn|group=Note|name=DemoFormat|Although many speedruns are released as video recordings, which are often preferred due to being more universal,  some communities use a game's native demo recordings (such as the <tt>DEM</tt> format in by ''Quake'') since these are much more compact and easier to share with others. Such recordings require specific software to view, usually a version of the original game. Some communities release speedruns in both formats so that they become accessible to a larger audience.}}\n\nTo achieve a high level of play, speedrunners often have to reason about the game differently from the way that ordinary players might. Speedruns usually follow [[gameplay]] routes that are planned out carefully before they are attempted. Many games have opportunities to disarrange the intended sequence of events and skip entire parts of it \u2014 often called [[sequence breaking]] \u2014 and many more have programming mistakes, or [[glitch]]es, that a skillful player can exploit to their advantage. [[Tool-assisted speedrun]]ning is a type of speedrunning in which various computer tools are used to obtain performances which would be near-impossible for a human player, and are not held in competition with speedruns done by human players in real time, known as real-time speedruns.\n\nSome games are considered to be particularly suited to speedrunning and have [[virtual community|online communities]] dedicated to them, which can provide an active platform for discussing, publishing, and improving speedruns. Speedruns can be viewed on a variety of platforms, including [[Streaming media|live streams]] where players can carry out and share their attempts in real-time. Although speedrunning was originally not a widespread phenomenon, it has since grown to involve several active websites and an increasingly expansive assortment of speedrun videos that are freely and widely circulated on the Internet.\n\n== Glitches and sequence breaking ==\n{{main|Glitch|Sequence breaking}}\nWhile routing, it becomes apparent that some of the goals in the game do not need to be achieved for completion. Such elements include [[cutscene]]s that need to be watched before the player can progress, items that the player needs to possess in order to continue to a next stage or even entire parts of the gameplay that may convey a part of the game's plot or a subplot. Skipping a part of the game in such a fashion that it can be described as disjointed with the game's intended/common sequence of events is referred to as ''sequence breaking''.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/sekiro-speedrunners-discover-wild-techniques-to-beat-th-1833720570|title=Sekiro Speedrunners Discover Wild Techniques To Beat The Game In 40 Minutes|website=Kotaku|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\nThe term ''sequence break'' was first used in 2003 in an online [[Internet forum|discussion forum]] thread concerning the [[GameCube|Nintendo GameCube]] game ''[[Metroid Prime]]''.{{refn|group=Note |name=OldMetroidTopics|Metroid 2002, a major Metroid speedrunning website, has retained back-ups of these topics that can be found at <tt>[http://www.metroid2002.com/home.php http://www.metroid2002.com/home.php]</tt>.

These categories usually include completing or avoiding specific aspects of the game and/or not allowing certain glitches or game exploits to be used in the run. An example of this would be the medallions/stones/trials category in ''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time''; this category requires the runner to beat all major levels in the game and restricts some of the glitches that can be performed. In ''[[Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!|Donkey Kong Country 3]]'', there is a \"Water%\" run, which constitutes collecting every DK Coin in the game; this requires the player to collect every Bear Coin to access the Lost World, but does not require a player to actually 100% the game and ignore the Banana Birds.<ref name=\"DKCspeedruns\">{{cite web|url=https://dkcspeedruns.com/Leaderboards#DKC3_-_Water.25|title=water% definition|accessdate=June 19, 2016}}</ref>{{Better source needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Randomizers ==\n{{Anchor|Randomizer}}\nA '''randomizer''' is a type of [[game mod]] that has been used in speedrunning, wherein software is used to shuffle the locations of elements (such as items) to provide an additional challenge.

When the activity became popular enough to accede to [[subculture]], the first sites dedicated to speedrunning started appearing\u2014usually specializing in just one or a few games. Some of these sites have sustained activity for a long time, sometimes even up to today, providing coverage of its members' achievements and serving as a platform for related discussions.\n\n=== COMPET-N (Doom) ===\nDecember 1993 saw the release of [[id Software]]'s ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', which allowed players to record demo files of their playthrough. The feature was first picked up by Christina \"Strunoph\" Norman in January 1994 when she launched the ''LMP Hall of Fame'' website.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\">{{cite web|url=https://www.doomworld.com/10years/demos/demos01.php|title=A Brief DOOM Demo History|author=Merrill, D.|year=2003|website=|publisher=Doomworld|accessdate=October 16, 2005}}</ref>\n\nThis site was, however, quickly followed up by the ''DOOM Honorific Titles'' (also known as the \"DHT\"),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fms27/dht/dht6.html|title=Doom Honorific Titles|last=|first=|date=|website=Doom Honorific Titles|accessdate=28 October 2016}}</ref> launched in May 1994 by Frank Stajano, which introduced the first serious competition between players.<ref name=\"SmashingTheClock\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3142599&did=1|title=Smashing the Clock|author=Turner, B.|year=2005|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=August 13, 2005}}</ref> This site, designed around a notion of earning titles by successfully recording a particular type of demo on one of the predetermined maps in the \"[[Doom WAD|IWADs]]\", would create the basis for all ''Doom'' demo sites that would follow.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> These so-called \"exams\" became very popular as the player had to earn each title by submitting a demo of the feat to one of the site's judges to justify his application. ''[[Doom II|Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'' was released in October 1994,<ref name=\"Origins\">{{cite web|url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1994|title=1994 - Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts and Design, List of Winners|accessdate=2009-06-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080614193353/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1994 |archivedate = June 14, 2008}}</ref> and the DHT conformed to the new additions as well as the new ''Doom'' version releases. At the height of its popularity, the DHT had many different categories and playing styles.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> For example, playing with only the in-game fists and pistol, while killing all monsters on a map, became known as \"Tyson\" mode, named after the heavyweight boxer and former champion [[Mike Tyson]]. \"Pacifist mode\" was playing without intentionally harming any monsters. Each category had \"easy\", \"medium\", and \"hard\" difficulty maps for players to get randomly chosen for. As an authentication method to prevent players from submitting demos made by other people, it was required that they performed a distinct \"dance\" during their demo (often at the very beginning). With such varied categories, the DHT was appealing to a diverse group of players.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> However, the DHT had trouble retaining a permanent Internet location. This, combined with the constantly changing rules and the diminished importance of most of the titles, caused public interest to wane as the years went by.\n\nIn November 1994, the definitive installment ''Doom'' speedrunning scene, in the form of the COMPET-N website, was launched.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/> Its creator, Simon Widlake, intended the site to be a record scoreboard for a variety of ''Doom''-related achievements, but unlike its predecessors, they were all based on the idea of fast completion, thus making it the first actual speedrunning site. Players were challenged to run through ''Doom''<nowiki/>'s levels as fast as humanly possible in order to attain a spot on the constantly updated COMPET-N scoreboards, leading to demo material gradually amounting to hundreds of hours of recorded gameplay.<ref name=\"DoomStats\">{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.doom2.net/~compet-n/database/cn.cgi | title = COMPET-N Database | publisher = Doom2.net | accessdate = October 28, 2016 | archivedate = April 12, 2014 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140412062105/http://www.doom2.net/~compet-n/database/cn.cgi | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nLike the DOOM Honorific Titles, this site experienced multiple location changes over time; it was hosted on the ''[[Simtel]]'' servers for a while, before Istvan Pataki took over as maintainer and moved the site to a now defunct [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] server of the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics|Technical University of Budapest]].

Not all of those newcomers agreed with the standard that runs should be made on the hardest possible difficulty level.

As is the case for the rest of the games in the series, highly [[nonlinear gameplay]] makes it possible for runners to search extensively for different routes towards the end of the game. In particular, the ability to perform sequence breaking has been researched thoroughly, leading to the discovery of ways to complete the games while obtaining only a small percentage of items. Prior to the inception of Metroid speedrunning, there were special websites which documented these so-called \"low-percentage\" completion possibilities.\n\nThe first game to be exceedingly popular with the speedrunning audience was ''[[Super Metroid]]'', released in 1994, which proved to lend itself to fast completion purposes very well.<ref name=\"SmashingTheClock\"/> It featured a physics system that allowed for a wide array of skills for mobility, like \"wall jumping\" or the \"Shinespark\", allowing players to skip over large areas of the game, or play through the game in different manners based on how well they can perform these tricks in contextual situations. Additionally, it had the same nonlinear gameplay as its predecessors.

Players first started recording these special demos when Andy \"Aurican\" Kempling released a modified version of the ''Doom'' [[source code]] that made it possible to record demos in slow motion and in several sessions. A couple of months afterwards, in June 1999, the first site made for the purpose of sharing these demos, aptly called \"Tools-Assisted Speedruns\", was opened by Esko Koskimaa, Peo Sjoblom, and Yonatan Donner.<ref name=\"DoomWorldHistory\"/>{{refn|group=Note |name=ToolsAssistedSpeedrun|Doom tool-assisted speedrunning is sometimes referred to as \"tools-assisted speedrunning\", after the first site used to share these demos.

I'm not going to redo the logo though.\"}}\n\nLike other such communities, the maintainers of the site stressed that their demos were for entertainment purposes rather than skill competitions, although the attempt to have the fastest time possible with tools itself became a competition as well.<ref name=\"AboutToolsAssistedSpeedruns\">{{cite web | year = 2000 | url = http://doomworld.com/tas/about.html | publisher = Internet Archive | title = Information about Tools-Assisted Speedruns | author = Koskimaa, E. | author2 = Sjoblom, P. | author3 = Donner, Y. | accessdate = April 8, 2006 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20000411175100/http://doomworld.com/tas/about.html | archivedate = April 11, 2000 | url-status = dead | df = mdy-all }}</ref> The site became a success, usually updating several times a week with demos recorded by its maintainers and submitted by its readers.

It was even feared that this fact would cause the downfall of competitive speedrunning.<ref name=\"SmashingTheClock\"/> Neither the Speed Demos Archive nor Metroid 2002 have ever published runs that were known to be made with a special emulator.

The most popular speedrun marathons are the biannual [[Games Done Quick]] marathon in the United States. Before the marathons, discussions take place on a forum, and runners submit their game choices. An online schedule is created that will show who is speedrunning, when they are speedrunning, and what game they are speedrunning. Their runs are streamed live at [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]], and runners often provide commentary throughout the run to give viewers a better understanding of what is going on. Runners who are speedrunning often practice their game in a practice room at the event before their scheduled run as a warm up, or they practice at home beforehand.

A former pastor, Mark R. Watkinson, felt that the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] was going to leave the country with a bad name, \"brother fighting brother in a civil war\", and wrote a letter to [[Salmon P. Chase]], Secretary of the Treasury, suggesting \"God, Liberty, Law,\" be put on the coins. Chase referred the matter to James B. Longacre, Mint Engraver. A committee later settled on \"In God We Trust\", and the words first appeared on a 2-cent coin. A plaque on the outside of the church announces the birthplace of the phrase.\n\nThe [[Morton Homestead]], one of the oldest buildings in Pennsylvania, was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1970.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\nThe Park Square, located between 9th and 10th streets, is becoming a central focal point of the town.

Also, the yearly prom goers for Interboro High School meet at the Park to get pictures taken as well as to board their busses for the dance.

It is located within {{convert|10|mi|0}} of [[Center City, Philadelphia]], with convenient rail access ([[SEPTA]], and connection to [[Amtrak]]).\n\n== History ==\nIn 1874, John Cochran of [[Chester, Pennsylvania|Chester]] purchased 103 acres from Joshua Pierson with the intention of dividing the property into lots and selling them.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ashmeade|first1=Henry Graham|title=History of Delaware County, Pennsylvania|date=1884|publisher=L.H.

A former pastor, Mark R. Watkinson, felt that the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] was going to leave the country with a bad name, \"brother fighting brother in a civil war\", and wrote a letter to [[Salmon P. Chase]], Secretary of the Treasury, suggesting \"God, Liberty, Law,\" be put on the coins. Chase referred the matter to James B. Longacre, Mint Engraver. A committee later settled on \"In God We Trust\", and the words first appeared on a 2-cent coin. A plaque on the outside of the church announces the birthplace of the phrase.\n\nThe [[Morton Homestead]], one of the oldest buildings in Pennsylvania, was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1970.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\nThe Park Square, located between 9th and 10th streets, is becoming a central focal point of the town. Our annual Fourth of July parade goes around our town and ends up at the Park Square. There are also musical events on Tuesdays during the summer months. The types vary from String bands to classical to rock and pop. Fun fact, the Park Square pavilion in the center of the park is the main backdrop for numerous wedding pictures. Also, the yearly prom goers for Interboro High School meet at the Park to get pictures taken as well as to board their busses for the dance. Plenty to do including a basketball court, swing sets, and sliding boards.\n\n==Geography==\nProspect Park is located in southeastern Delaware County at {{Coord|39|53|9|N|75|18|26|W|type:city}} (39.885712, -75.307166).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is bordered to the east by [[Norwood, Pennsylvania|Norwood]], to the south by [[Tinicum Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Tinicum Township]], to the west by [[Ridley Park, Pennsylvania|Ridley Park]], and to the west and north by [[Ridley Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Ridley Township]].\n\n[[U.S. Route 13]] crosses the borough, leading northeast to Philadelphia and southwest {{convert|4|mi|0}} to [[Chester, Pennsylvania|Chester]].
