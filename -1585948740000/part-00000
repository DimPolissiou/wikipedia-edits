{"title_page": "Elizabeth Cullen Dunn", "text_new": "{{BLP sources|date=March 2016}}\n'''Elizabeth Cullen Dunn''' (born 1968) is an American political anthropologist and geographer.  Her work focuses on responses to catastrophic social change, particularly in the post-Soviet world.\n\n==Education==\nDunn holds a Ph.D. in anthropology from [[Johns Hopkins University]] (1998).\n\n==Scholarship==\nBroadly summarized, Dunn\u2019s work investigates governance, the state, and the ways in which these processes strive to produce governable subjects. She investigates these topics by examining the ways they are manifest in people\u2019s lived experiences. Though all Dunn\u2019s work deals with these topics, thematically, it can be divided into three bodies of literature: on foreign direct investment (FDI) in [[Poland]] and the former Eastern Bloc more broadly; on global food safety regulation; and, most recently, on forced migration.\n\n===FDI in Poland===\nIn her book, ''Privatizing Poland'', Dunn examines the attempts at transition from Eastern European planned economies to neoliberal economic models. In doing so, she investigates the importance of governance, discipline, and the production of subjectivities to economic models. Dunn uses the takeover of a Polish baby food canning factory by the American company Gerber as a case study for this investigation. What she finds is that, while there are similarities in the management and organizational techniques applied to industry in the West and the former [[Warsaw Pact]] countries, differences in economic structure and planning mechanisms produced rhythms of work and of life generally that were very different in Poland from those in the capitalist West. These rhythms in turn influenced the attitudes and personhood of the Polish people. The result is that introduction of neoliberal capitalism came to be a project not just of privatization and market reform, but rather of cultural transformation, an attempt to shape the Polish people into neoliberal subjects, adapted to the rhythms of life and work under neoliberal capitalism.<ref>Dunn, E. (2004) ''Privatizing Poland: Baby Food, Big Business, and the Remaking of Labor''.  Ithaca: Cornell University Press.</ref>\n\n===Global Food Safety Regulation===\nIn her work on global food safety regulation, Dunn examines how the state reacts to outbreaks or changing incidence of food-borne illness. She examines the state\u2019s attempts to control or eliminate these diseases via regulation, while nevertheless adhering to its own foundational, politico-economic principles (e.g. socialist, planned economy; neoliberal capitalism). She identifies the ways in which processes of food production and the regulation thereof work to produce governable subjects by instilling particular values of self-governance or dependence on the state. Dunn also utilizes the presence of disease-causing organisms or outbreaks of food-borne illness as tracers to identify geographical and social spaces in which the state fails to control illness. She investigates how these spaces of chaos or \u201cwildness\u201d can have various causes, sometimes representing a failure of the state to fully penetrate the spaces of every-day life; while in other instances being an integral, reproduced aspect of governance.<ref>Dunn, Elizabeth.

In this work, Dunn builds on scholarship that has critically examined the phenomenon of humanitarian aid \u2013 its penchant for providing immediate aid rather than long-term support, the resultant inadequacy of \u2018standardized\u2019 aid packages, its responsibility to local elites and foreign donors, and the divisive question of aid in relation to politics. Examining these questions herself, and using them as a foundation, she identifies how humanitarian aid functions as a condition, keeping the \u2018recipients\u2019 of aid in a state of limbo, between the past and the future, unsure of what to expect from the future, and therefore unable to act in the present. Finally, she investigates the ways in which this condition, constantly reproduced by the very structures which claim to provide stability and relief, in fact transforms the recipients of aid into easily governable subjects, beholden to a system that insists on maintaining their physical lives, while denying them the solid footing from which to end their reliance on this same system.<ref>Dunn, E.

Ithaca: Cornell University Press.</ref>\n\n==Career==\nAfter graduating with her PhD, Dunn accepted a fellowship at the [[Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin]] from 1999-2000.

\"The Glory Days\" of ETSU basketball, between 1989 and 1992, ETSU won 4 straight [[Southern Conference]] titles while compiling 99 wins. During this 4-year period ETSU had wins over prestigious programs such as Arizona, NC State (3 times), Wake Forest, Cincinnati, BYU, Xavier, Mississippi State, Southern Miss, Tennessee (twice) and Memphis. ETSU also suffered their most famous loss when they lost by 1 point to top ranked Oklahoma as a 16th seed in the [[1989 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1989 NCAA Tournament]]. \n\nWhen [[Les Robinson]] left for NC State after the 1990 season, longtime assistant Alan Leforce took over a veteran team led by Senior [[Keith Jennings (basketball)|Keith \"Mister\" Jennings]]. The team was ranked as high as 10th<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/m_basketball_RB/2010/D1.pdf|title=Division I Records|accessdate=2010-10-02|publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]|page=85}}</ref> in the nation during the 1991 season and finished the year 17th in the AP poll and 15th in the Coaches poll.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/conferences/SOUC/1991.html |title=1990\u201391 Southern Conference Season Summary &#124; College Basketball at |publisher=Sports-reference.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-23}}</ref> In the [[1992 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1992 NCAA Tournament]] ETSU upset the [[Arizona Wildcats]] in the opening round, but eventually fell in the second round to the [[Michigan Wolverines]] and the [[Fab Five (University of Michigan)|Fab Five]]. \n\nThe Buccaneers went into steep decline after that, bottoming out with a 7-20 record in 1995-96. LeForce resigned after the season.\n\n===The Ed Dechellis era===\n\nIn 1996 [[Ed Dechellis]] replaced Alan Leforce who resigned after the 1995\u20131996 season. In 2001 Dechellis led ETSU to their first regular season conference title since the 91\u201392 season. In 2003 Dechellis helped ETSU win their first Southern Conference Tournament title and first NCAA berth since 1992. ETSU faced [[Wake Forest University]] in the first round where they lost in the final seconds 73\u201376 after having a chance to win the game with the last shot. After the 2003 season Dechellis left for [[Penn State]].\n\nDechellis complied 105\u201393 record at ETSU but is mostly remembered for bringing prominence back to the ETSU basketball program that had struggled after the 1993 season.\n\n===The Murry Bartow era===\nIn 2003 ETSU hired [[Murry Bartow]] after [[Ed Dechellis]] took the head coaching position at [[Penn State]]. Bartow took over a senior led team that won 27 games and nearly went undefeated in conference play in his first season; additionally, ETSU won their second straight Southern Conference Tournament and headed back to the NCAA tournament for the second straight year. ETSU had another close call in the [[2004 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2004 NCAA Tournament]] when they lost to [[Cincinnati Bearcats|Cincinnati]] 77\u201380 in the closing seconds, much like the Wake Forest game the previous year.\n\nIn the 2005\u20132006 season ETSU left the [[Southern Conference]] to join the [[Atlantic Sun Conference]] after the school dropped football. During his time in the Atlantic Sun ETSU has received 4 postseason bids. Back to Back NCAA tournaments in 2009 and 2010, the NIT in 2007 and the CIT in 2011.  The Buccaneers rejoined the Southern Conference as part of reinstating football in 2016.

\"The Glory Days\" of ETSU basketball, between 1989 and 1992, ETSU won 4 straight [[Southern Conference]] titles while compiling 99 wins. During this 4-year period ETSU had wins over prestigious programs such as Arizona, NC State (3 times), Wake Forest, Cincinnati, BYU, Xavier, Mississippi State, Southern Miss, Tennessee (twice) and Memphis. ETSU also suffered their most famous loss when they lost by 1 point to top ranked Oklahoma as a 16th seed in the [[1989 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1989 NCAA Tournament]]. \n\nWhen [[Les Robinson]] left for NC State after the 1990 season, longtime assistant Alan Leforce took over a veteran team led by Senior [[Keith Jennings (basketball)|Keith \"Mister\" Jennings]]. The team was ranked as high as 10th<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/m_basketball_RB/2010/D1.pdf|title=Division I Records|accessdate=2010-10-02|publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]|page=85}}</ref> in the nation during the 1991 season and finished the year 17th in the AP poll and 15th in the Coaches poll.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/conferences/SOUC/1991.html |title=1990\u201391 Southern Conference Season Summary &#124; College Basketball at |publisher=Sports-reference.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-23}}</ref> In the [[1992 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1992 NCAA Tournament]] ETSU upset the [[Arizona Wildcats]] in the opening round, but eventually fell in the second round to the [[Michigan Wolverines]] and the [[Fab Five (University of Michigan)|Fab Five]]. \n\nThe Buccaneers went into steep decline after that, bottoming out with a 7-20 record in 1995-96. LeForce resigned after the season.\n\n===The Ed Dechellis era===\n\nIn 1996 [[Ed Dechellis]] replaced Alan Leforce who resigned after the 1995\u20131996 season. In 2001 Dechellis led ETSU to their first regular season conference title since the 91\u201392 season. In 2003 Dechellis helped ETSU win their first Southern Conference Tournament title and first NCAA berth since 1992. ETSU faced [[Wake Forest University]] in the first round where they lost in the final seconds 73\u201376 after having a chance to win the game with the last shot. After the 2003 season Dechellis left for [[Penn State]].\n\nDechellis complied 105\u201393 record at ETSU but is mostly remembered for bringing prominence back to the ETSU basketball program that had struggled after the 1993 season.\n\n===The Murry Bartow era===\nIn 2003 ETSU hired [[Murry Bartow]] after [[Ed Dechellis]] took the head coaching position at [[Penn State]]. Bartow took over a senior led team that won 27 games and nearly went undefeated in conference play in his first season; additionally, ETSU won their second straight Southern Conference Tournament and headed back to the NCAA tournament for the second straight year. ETSU had another close call in the [[2004 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2004 NCAA Tournament]] when they lost to [[Cincinnati Bearcats|Cincinnati]] 77\u201380 in the closing seconds, much like the Wake Forest game the previous year.\n\nIn the 2005\u20132006 season ETSU left the [[Southern Conference]] to join the [[Atlantic Sun Conference]] after the school dropped football. During his time in the Atlantic Sun ETSU has received 4 postseason bids. Back to Back NCAA tournaments in 2009 and 2010, the NIT in 2007 and the CIT in 2011.  The Buccaneers rejoined the Southern Conference as part of reinstating football in 2016.  After 12 years, an overall record of 224\u2013169 (with a record of 16\u201314, 8\u201310 in SoCon play in the 2014\u201315 season), and three NCAA appearances at East Tennessee State, Bartow was fired due a five-season tournament drought with declining team performance.<ref>{{cite web |title=ETSU announces Bartow will not return for 2015\u201316 season |url=http://www.etsubucs.com/mbasketball/news/2014-15/11481/etsu-announces-bartow-will-not-return-for-2015-16-season/|publisher=Etsubucs.com|accessdate=2015-07-23 |first=Murry|last=Bartow|date=March 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===The Steve Forbes era===\nAfter [[Murry Bartow]] was fired, [[Steve Forbes (basketball)|Steve Forbes]] became the 16th head coach in ETSU's 95-year history on March 30, 2015. He served two seasons as an assistant coach at [[Wichita State|Wichita State Shockers men's basketball]] where he helped take the Shockers to the Sweet 16 the past season before taking the ETSU job. Forbes' recruiting ties and his extensive background as an assistant coach at the NCAA Division I level \u2013 which included a five-year stop at the [[University of Tennessee]] \u2013 made him a perfect fit for ETSU, according to ETSU Director of Intercollegiate Athletics Dr. Richard Sander.<ref>{{cite web|author=Steve Forbes |url=http://www.etsubucs.com/mbasketball/coaches/ |title=Steve Forbes \u2013 Men's Basketball Coaches \u2013 Official Site of East Tennessee State Athletics |publisher=Etsubucs.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-23}}</ref> In the first five seasons, Forbes has tallied at least 24 wins each year.  The 2017 team shared the Southern Conference regular season title and won the Southern Conference Tournament in Asheville to represent the league in the NCAA Tournament.  Forbes led the team to another conference regular season championship in 2019-20 and a school record 30 wins.\n\n==Postseason==\n===NCAA Division I tournament results===\nThe Buccaneers have appeared in the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Division I Tournament]] ten times.

of the company -->\n[[File:Nokia Toilet paper.JPG|thumb|Rolls of toilet paper produced by Nokia in the 1960s, Museum Centre Vapriikki, Tampere]]\n\nNokia's history dates to 1865, when [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Finnish-Swede]] [[Mining engineering|mining engineer]] [[Fredrik Idestam]] established a [[pulp mill]] near the town of [[Tampere]], Finland (then in the [[Russian Empire]]). A second pulp mill was opened in 1868 near the neighboring town of [[Nokia, Finland|Nokia]], offering better [[hydropower]] resources. In 1871, Idestam, together with friend [[Leo Mechelin]], formed a shared company from it and called it ''Nokia [[Aktiebolag|Ab]]'' (in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], ''Nokia Company'' being the English equivalent), after the site of the second pulp mill.\n\nIdestam retired in 1896, making Mechelin the company's chairman. Mechelin expanded into [[electricity generation]] by 1902 which Idestam had opposed. In 1904 [[Suomen Gummitehdas]] (''Finnish Rubber Works''), a [[rubber]] business founded by Eduard Pol\u00f3n, established a factory near the town of Nokia and used its name.\n\nIn 1922, Nokia Ab entered into a partnership with Finnish Rubber Works and [[Kaapelitehdas]] (''the Cable Factory''), all now jointly under the leadership of Pol\u00f3n. Finnish Rubber Works company grew rapidly when it moved to the Nokia region in the 1930s to take advantage of the electrical power supply, and the cable company soon did too.\n\nNokia at the time also made [[respirator]]s for both civilian and military use, from the 1930s well into the early 1990s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gasmasklexikon.com/Page/Start01.htm|title=Start01|website=Gasmasklexikon.com|access-date=23 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n===1967\u20131990===\n[[File:Patteriston komentopaikka H\u00e4meenlinna 4.JPG|thumb|LV 317M military radio in the H\u00e4meenlinna artillery museum]]\n\nIn 1967, the three companies \u2013 Nokia, Kaapelitehdas and Finnish Rubber Works \u2013 merged and created a new Nokia Corporation, restructured into four major businesses: forestry, cable, rubber and electronics. In the early 1970s, it entered the networking and radio industry. Nokia also started making military equipment for [[Finnish Defence Forces|Finland's defence forces]] (''Puolustusvoimat''), such as the [[Sanomalaite M/90]] communicator in 1983, and the [[M61 gas mask]] first developed in the 1960s. Nokia was now also making [[professional mobile radio]]s, [[telephone switch]]es, [[capacitors]] and [[chemicals]].\n\nAfter Finland's trade agreement with the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1960s, Nokia expanded into the Soviet market. It soon widened trade, ranging from automatic [[telephone exchange]]s to [[robotics]] among others; by the late 1970s the Soviet Union became a major market for Nokia, helping to yield high profits. Nokia also co-operated on scientific technology with the Soviet Union. The U.S. government became increasingly suspicious of that co-operation after the end of the [[Cold War]] [[d\u00e9tente]] in the early 1980s. Nokia imported many US-made components and used them for the Soviets, and according to U.S. Deputy Minister of Defence, [[Richard Perle]], Nokia had a secret co-operation with [[The Pentagon]] that allowed the U.S. to keep track of technology developments in the Soviet Union through trading with Nokia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/us_threatened_to_block_finnish_arms_deal_over_high-tech_exports_in_1980s/5710542|title=U.S. Threatened to Block Finnish Arms Deal Over High-Tech Exports in 1980's}}</ref> This was a demonstration of Finland trading with both sides, as it was neutral during the Cold War.\n\nIn 1977, [[Kari Kairamo]] became CEO and he transformed the company's businesses. By this time, Finland was becoming what has been called \"Nordic Japan\". Under his leadership Nokia acquired many companies including television maker [[Salora (Finnish company)|Salora]] in 1984, followed by Swedish electronics and computer maker [[Luxor AB]] in 1985, and French television maker Oceanic in 1987. This made Nokia the third-largest television manufacturer of Europe (behind [[Philips]] and [[Thomson SA|Thomson]]). The existing brands continued to be used until the end of the television business in 1996.\n\n[[File:Nokia Mikko display and keyboard.JPG|thumb|Nokia Mikko 3 minicomputer, 1978]]\n[[File:Mobira Cityman 450.JPG|thumb|upright|Mobira Cityman 450, 1985]]\n\nIn 1987, Nokia acquired Schaub-Lorenz, the consumer operations of Germany's [[Standard Elektrik Lorenz]] (SEL), which included its \"Schaub-Lorenz\" and \"Graetz\" brands. It was originally part of American conglomerate [[International Telephone & Telegraph]] (ITT), and after the acquisition products were sold under the \"ITT Nokia\" brand, despite SEL's sale to Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'Electricit\u00e9 (CGE), the predecessor of [[Alcatel-Lucent|Alcatel]], in 1986.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nOn 1 April 1988, Nokia bought the computer division of [[Ericsson]]'s Information Systems,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/21/business/company-news-nokia-oy-buys-stake-in-ericsson.html|title=COMPANY NEWS; Nokia Oy Buys Stake in Ericsson|last=Reuters|date=21 January 1988|work=The New York Times|access-date=14 August 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> which originated as a computer division of Swedish aircraft and car manufacturer [[Saab Group|Saab]] called [[Datasaab]]. Ericsson Information Systems made [[Alfaskop]] terminals, [[typewriter]]s, [[minicomputer]]s and Ericsson-branded [[IBM compatible PC]]s. The merger with Nokia's Information Systems division\u2014which since 1981 had a line of personal computers called [[MikroMikko]]\u2014resulted in the name Nokia Data.\n\nNokia also acquired Mobira, a mobile telephony company, which was the foundation of its future mobile phones business. In 1981, Mobira launched the [[Nordic Mobile Telephone]] (NMT) service, the world's first international cellular network and the first to allow international [[roaming]]. In 1982, Mobira launched the [[Mobira Senator]] car phone, Nokia's first mobile phone. At that time, the company had no interest in producing mobile phones, which the executive board regarded as akin to [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]]'s gadgets: improbably futuristic and niche devices. After all these acquisitions, Nokia's revenue base became US$2.7 billion. CEO Kairamo committed suicide on 11 December 1988.\n\nIn 1987, [[Kaapelitehdas]] discontinued production of cables at its [[Helsinki]] factory after 44 years, effectively shutting down the sub-company.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Mobira 800-NDB.JPG|Mobira 800-NDB non-directional beacon located in the Finnish Air Force signals museum\nFile:Lasersuunnin merivoimien vuosip\u00e4iv\u00e4 2013 Kotka 3.JPG|Nokia MAC 8532 laser rangefinder previously used by Finnish coastal artillery\nFile:Patteriston komentopaikka H\u00e4meenlinna 2.JPG|H\u00e4meenlinna artillery museum display containing fire control officer with Nokia artillery calculator in Finnish artillery battalion command post\nFile:MikroMikko 4 TT m216 Tekniikan museo 02.jpg|Late 1980s MikroMikko 4 TT m216 desktop computer in the Museum of Technology, Helsinki, Finland\nFile:Itt-nokia television and vhs-video.jpeg|ITT Nokia television with an ITT Nokia VCR (ITT/SEL)\nFile:Mobira kaukohakulaite.png|A 1986 Mobira pager\n</gallery>\n\n===1990\u20132010===\n[[File:Jorma Ollila 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jorma Ollila]], who oversaw the rise of Nokia in the mobile phone market as CEO from 1992 to 2006]]\n\nFollowing [[Simo Vuorilehto]]'s appointment as CEO, a major restructuring was planned. With 11 groups within the company, Vuorilehto divested industrial units he deemed as un-strategic. [[Nokian Tyres]] (''Nokian Renkaat''), a tyre producer originally formed as a division of Finnish Rubber Works in 1932, split away from Nokia Corporation in 1988. Two years later, in 1990, Finnish Rubber Works followed suit. In 1991 Nokia sold its computer division, Nokia Data, to [[UK]]-based [[International Computers Limited]] (ICL), the precursor of [[Fujitsu Siemens]]. Investors thought of this as financial trouble and Nokia's stock price sank as a result. Finland was now also experiencing its [[Early 1990s depression in Finland|worst recession in living memory]], and the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse]] of the Soviet Union, a major customer, made matters worse.\n\nVuorilehto quit in January 1992 and was replaced by [[Jorma Ollila]], who had been the head of the mobile phone business from 1990 and advised against selling that division. Ollila decided to turn Nokia into a '[[Telecommunication|telecom]]-oriented' company, and he eventually got rid of divisions like the power business. This strategy proved to be very successful and the company grew rapidly in the following years. Nokia's operating profit went from negative in 1991 to $1 billion in 1995 and almost $4 billion by 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2000/05/01/278948/index.htm|title=Nokia's Secret Code Perhaps the least hierarchical big company in the world, Nokia has been winning big in wireless.

Nokia assisted in the development of the [[GSM]] mobile standard in the 1980s, and developed the first GSM network with [[Siemens]], the predecessor to [[Nokia Siemens Network]]. The world's first GSM call was made by Finnish prime minister [[Harri Holkeri]] on 1 July 1991, using Nokia equipment on the 900&nbsp;MHz band network built by Nokia and operated by [[Radiolinja]]. In November 1992, the [[Nokia 1011]] launched, making it the first commercially available GSM mobile phone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/1997/10/17/nokias-pioneering-gsm-research-and-development-to-be-awarded-by-eduard-rhein-foundation|title=Nokia\u00b4s Pioneering GSM Research and Development to be Awarded by Eduard Rhein Foundation |publisher=Nokia}}</ref>\n\nSalora Oy as a Nokia subsidiary ended in 1989 when the division was merged into Nokia-Mobira Oy.

of the company -->\n[[File:Nokia Toilet paper.JPG|thumb|Rolls of toilet paper produced by Nokia in the 1960s, Museum Centre Vapriikki, Tampere]]\n\nNokia's history dates to 1865, when [[Swedish-speaking population of Finland|Finnish-Swede]] [[Mining engineering|mining engineer]] [[Fredrik Idestam]] established a [[pulp mill]] near the town of [[Tampere]], Finland (then in the [[Russian Empire]]). A second pulp mill was opened in 1868 near the neighboring town of [[Nokia, Finland|Nokia]], offering better [[hydropower]] resources. In 1871, Idestam, together with friend [[Leo Mechelin]], formed a shared company from it and called it ''Nokia [[Aktiebolag|Ab]]'' (in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], ''Nokia Company'' being the English equivalent), after the site of the second pulp mill.\n\nIdestam retired in 1896, making Mechelin the company's chairman. Mechelin expanded into [[electricity generation]] by 1902 which Idestam had opposed. In 1904 [[Suomen Gummitehdas]] (''Finnish Rubber Works''), a [[rubber]] business founded by Eduard Pol\u00f3n, established a factory near the town of Nokia and used its name.\n\nIn 1922, Nokia Ab entered into a partnership with Finnish Rubber Works and [[Kaapelitehdas]] (''the Cable Factory''), all now jointly under the leadership of Pol\u00f3n. Finnish Rubber Works company grew rapidly when it moved to the Nokia region in the 1930s to take advantage of the electrical power supply, and the cable company soon did too.\n\nNokia at the time also made [[respirator]]s for both civilian and military use, from the 1930s well into the early 1990s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gasmasklexikon.com/Page/Start01.htm|title=Start01|website=Gasmasklexikon.com|access-date=23 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n===1967\u20131990===\n[[File:Patteriston komentopaikka H\u00e4meenlinna 4.JPG|thumb|LV 317M military radio in the H\u00e4meenlinna artillery museum]]\n\nIn 1967, the three companies \u2013 Nokia, Kaapelitehdas and Finnish Rubber Works \u2013 merged and created a new Nokia Corporation, restructured into four major businesses: forestry, cable, rubber and electronics. In the early 1970s, it entered the networking and radio industry. Nokia also started making military equipment for [[Finnish Defence Forces|Finland's defence forces]] (''Puolustusvoimat''), such as the [[Sanomalaite M/90]] communicator in 1983, and the [[M61 gas mask]] first developed in the 1960s. Nokia was now also making [[professional mobile radio]]s, [[telephone switch]]es, [[capacitors]] and [[chemicals]].\n\nAfter Finland's trade agreement with the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1960s, Nokia expanded into the Soviet market. It soon widened trade, ranging from automatic [[telephone exchange]]s to [[robotics]] among others; by the late 1970s the Soviet Union became a major market for Nokia, helping to yield high profits. Nokia also co-operated on scientific technology with the Soviet Union. The U.S. government became increasingly suspicious of that co-operation after the end of the [[Cold War]] [[d\u00e9tente]] in the early 1980s. Nokia imported many US-made components and used them for the Soviets, and according to U.S. Deputy Minister of Defence, [[Richard Perle]], Nokia had a secret co-operation with [[The Pentagon]] that allowed the U.S. to keep track of technology developments in the Soviet Union through trading with Nokia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/us_threatened_to_block_finnish_arms_deal_over_high-tech_exports_in_1980s/5710542|title=U.S. Threatened to Block Finnish Arms Deal Over High-Tech Exports in 1980's}}</ref> This was a demonstration of Finland trading with both sides, as it was neutral during the Cold War.\n\nIn 1977, [[Kari Kairamo]] became CEO and he transformed the company's businesses. By this time, Finland was becoming what has been called \"Nordic Japan\". Under his leadership Nokia acquired many companies including television maker [[Salora (Finnish company)|Salora]] in 1984, followed by Swedish electronics and computer maker [[Luxor AB]] in 1985, and French television maker Oceanic in 1987. This made Nokia the third-largest television manufacturer of Europe (behind [[Philips]] and [[Thomson SA|Thomson]]). The existing brands continued to be used until the end of the television business in 1996.\n\n[[File:Nokia Mikko display and keyboard.JPG|thumb|Nokia Mikko 3 minicomputer, 1978]]\n[[File:Mobira Cityman 450.JPG|thumb|upright|Mobira Cityman 450, 1985]]\n\nIn 1987, Nokia acquired Schaub-Lorenz, the consumer operations of Germany's [[Standard Elektrik Lorenz]] (SEL), which included its \"Schaub-Lorenz\" and \"Graetz\" brands. It was originally part of American conglomerate [[International Telephone & Telegraph]] (ITT), and after the acquisition products were sold under the \"ITT Nokia\" brand, despite SEL's sale to Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'Electricit\u00e9 (CGE), the predecessor of [[Alcatel-Lucent|Alcatel]], in 1986.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nOn 1 April 1988, Nokia bought the computer division of [[Ericsson]]'s Information Systems,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/21/business/company-news-nokia-oy-buys-stake-in-ericsson.html|title=COMPANY NEWS; Nokia Oy Buys Stake in Ericsson|last=Reuters|date=21 January 1988|work=The New York Times|access-date=14 August 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> which originated as a computer division of Swedish aircraft and car manufacturer [[Saab Group|Saab]] called [[Datasaab]]. Ericsson Information Systems made [[Alfaskop]] terminals, [[typewriter]]s, [[minicomputer]]s and Ericsson-branded [[IBM compatible PC]]s. The merger with Nokia's Information Systems division\u2014which since 1981 had a line of personal computers called [[MikroMikko]]\u2014resulted in the name Nokia Data.\n\nNokia also acquired Mobira, a mobile telephony company, which was the foundation of its future mobile phones business. In 1981, Mobira launched the [[Nordic Mobile Telephone]] (NMT) service, the world's first international cellular network and the first to allow international [[roaming]]. In 1982, Mobira launched the [[Mobira Senator]] car phone, Nokia's first mobile phone. At that time, the company had no interest in producing mobile phones, which the executive board regarded as akin to [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]]'s gadgets: improbably futuristic and niche devices. After all these acquisitions, Nokia's revenue base became US$2.7 billion. CEO Kairamo committed suicide on 11 December 1988.\n\nIn 1987, [[Kaapelitehdas]] discontinued production of cables at its [[Helsinki]] factory after 44 years, effectively shutting down the sub-company.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Mobira 800-NDB.JPG|Mobira 800-NDB non-directional beacon located in the Finnish Air Force signals museum\nFile:Lasersuunnin merivoimien vuosip\u00e4iv\u00e4 2013 Kotka 3.JPG|Nokia MAC 8532 laser rangefinder previously used by Finnish coastal artillery\nFile:Patteriston komentopaikka H\u00e4meenlinna 2.JPG|H\u00e4meenlinna artillery museum display containing fire control officer with Nokia artillery calculator in Finnish artillery battalion command post\nFile:MikroMikko 4 TT m216 Tekniikan museo 02.jpg|Late 1980s MikroMikko 4 TT m216 desktop computer in the Museum of Technology, Helsinki, Finland\nFile:Itt-nokia television and vhs-video.jpeg|ITT Nokia television with an ITT Nokia VCR (ITT/SEL)\nFile:Mobira kaukohakulaite.png|A 1986 Mobira pager\n</gallery>\n\n===1990\u20132010===\n[[File:Jorma Ollila 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jorma Ollila]], who oversaw the rise of Nokia in the mobile phone market as CEO from 1992 to 2006]]\n\nFollowing [[Simo Vuorilehto]]'s appointment as CEO, a major restructuring was planned. With 11 groups within the company, Vuorilehto divested industrial units he deemed as un-strategic. [[Nokian Tyres]] (''Nokian Renkaat''), a tyre producer originally formed as a division of Finnish Rubber Works in 1932, split away from Nokia Corporation in 1988. Two years later, in 1990, Finnish Rubber Works followed suit. In 1991 Nokia sold its computer division, Nokia Data, to [[UK]]-based [[International Computers Limited]] (ICL), the precursor of [[Fujitsu Siemens]]. Investors thought of this as financial trouble and Nokia's stock price sank as a result. Finland was now also experiencing its [[Early 1990s depression in Finland|worst recession in living memory]], and the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse]] of the Soviet Union, a major customer, made matters worse.\n\nVuorilehto quit in January 1992 and was replaced by [[Jorma Ollila]], who had been the head of the mobile phone business from 1990 and advised against selling that division. Ollila decided to turn Nokia into a '[[Telecommunication|telecom]]-oriented' company, and he eventually got rid of divisions like the power business. This strategy proved to be very successful and the company grew rapidly in the following years. Nokia's operating profit went from negative in 1991 to $1 billion in 1995 and almost $4 billion by 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2000/05/01/278948/index.htm|title=Nokia's Secret Code Perhaps the least hierarchical big company in the world, Nokia has been winning big in wireless.

Nokia assisted in the development of the [[GSM]] mobile standard in the 1980s, and developed the first GSM network with [[Siemens]], the predecessor to [[Nokia Siemens Network]]. The world's first GSM call was made by Finnish prime minister [[Harri Holkeri]] on 1 July 1991, using Nokia equipment on the 900&nbsp;MHz band network built by Nokia and operated by [[Radiolinja]]. In November 1992, the [[Nokia 1011]] launched, making it the first commercially available GSM mobile phone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nokia.com/en_int/news/releases/1997/10/17/nokias-pioneering-gsm-research-and-development-to-be-awarded-by-eduard-rhein-foundation|title=Nokia\u00b4s Pioneering GSM Research and Development to be Awarded by Eduard Rhein Foundation |publisher=Nokia}}</ref>\n\nSalora Oy as a Nokia subsidiary ended in 1989 when the division was merged into Nokia-Mobira Oy.

It aired on [[TVN (South Korean TV channel)|tvN]] starting December 23, 2017, every Saturday and Sunday at 21:00 ([[Korea Standard Time|KST]]).\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn 2017, Son Oh-gong and Ma-wang are in conflict with each other as they look for a true light in a dark world where evil thrives. From there, Son Oh-gong is bound to his protective role towards Seon-mi, the little girl he had met years ago. Having made a contract with Seon-mi 25 years ago, entitling her to seek help from Son Oh-gong whenever she calls him in exchange for letting him free, the two meet again in a fateful encounter.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|section|date=January 2019}}\nSeon-mi is a young a girl cursed with the ability to see ghosts and spirits. Her seemingly irrational behavior has isolated her from her family and peers, and her only protection is her grandmother and a small yellow umbrella with protection spells written by a Buddhist monk. One day when she walks home from school, a ghost follows her, and this is witnessed by a mysterious man in a suit and black top hat (Woo Ma-wang). The mysterious man exorcises the ghost for her, and asks her for a favor: to enter a magical house and retrieve a certain fan. She is also given specific instructions to ignore anyone she sees in there. However, the person inside the house is Son Oh-gong, the Monkey King, who was imprisoned inside by Heaven for his crimes. He blocks her path and forces her to acknowledge him, and tells her that the man outside is a great danger to her as well. Oh-gong makes her a deal: if she puts out the five candles on the table and frees him, he promises to protect her from all dangers in her life every time she calls his name. But after she agrees and releases him, Oh-gong steals the memory of his name out of her head and makes a run for it, leaving young Seon-mi stranded in the middle of nowhere.\n\nIn the present day, Seon-mi has grown up into an adult. Still armed with her little magic umbrella, she owns a real estate company that specializes in buying haunted houses, exorcising the spirits, and then flipping them for large profits. At a busy intersection, Seon-mi and Oh-gong spot each other and Seon-mi asks why he did what he did. He gives an unsatisfactory answer and Seon-mi tearfully asks aloud why she ever bothered having faith in him as a child. Meanwhile, Son Oh-gong is looking to reinstate his status as an immortal and has been doing various good deeds to earn brownie points with Heaven. He learns from a possessed doll that Sam-jang has been born, and anyone who eats Sam-jang's flesh can gain immortality. He decides to figure out who it is and eat them. However, Sam-jang is none other than Seon-mi, which means that Oh-gong cannot eat her without violating the promise he made to her as a child that he would protect her. \n\nWhile Oh-gong tries to figure out a way to convince Seon-mi to die for him, Soo Bo-ri goes to Woo Ma-wang and asks him for help in protecting Sam-jang. Ma-wang takes Seon-mi to a antique shop with magical wares. There an old lady (Bodhisattva Guanyin) sells him a Geumganggo, a magical bracelet that will ensure the obedience of anyone who wears it through the power of love. The original Geumganggo is worn on the head, but this version is worn on the wrist. Seon-mi gives it to Oh-gong as a gift on Christmas Eve, and has a prophetic dream about standing in a field, wearing a [[hanbok]], and giving him a kiss. \n\nThis dream comes true when Seon-mi is dragged into a haunted painting by a malevolent spirit that kidnaps women and tries to marry them all. Oh-gong enlists the help of Pal-gye, a pig demon and pop artist under Ma-wang's entertainment company, to get inside the painting. Pal-gye helps him, but he and Ma-wang burn the painting instead, trapping both Seon-mi and Oh-gong inside. Seon-mi decides to follow her dream and kisses Oh-gong, thus activating the Geumganggo, though she did not realize what the Geumganggo would do. Oh-gong gives back her memory of his name and forces her out of the painting world, because he cannot leave the painting world unless she summons him from the outside. Seon-mi cuts her own hand and attracts a hoard of demons to her before calling out Oh-gong's name. Oh-gong exits the painting world and rescues her from the demons.\n\nFrom then on, the main plot is focused on Seon-mi and Oh-gong's budding relationship despite these difficult circumstances. Oh-gong professes to be deeply in love with Seon-mi, but only because of the Geumganggo. He constantly reminds her that if she takes it off, his love will disappear, and he may return to wanting to eat her for immortality instead. Seon-mi, who has been a loner all her life, can't help but be touched by Oh-gong's thoughtful actions, and struggles to guard her heart against any romantic feelings because Samjang's tragic destiny is always to be a sacrifice for humanity against growing evil. Each episode involves Seon-mi and Oh-gong fighting off the demon of the week while dealing with their own internal conflicts. Seon-mi's feelings for Oh-gong are also constantly tested as she learns more about the kind of person Oh-gong is and his many secrets. The nightmare looming constantly over both their heads is a prophetic dream that Seon-mi had about the world ending, and knowing that she had to do everything she could to prevent it. Oh-gong later also learns that his role as Sam-jang's protector means he will either kill her, or she will kill him. This further drives them apart even as they fall more in love with each other.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Lee Seung-gi]] as Son Oh-gong (based on [[Sun Wukong]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kpopherald.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=201711051421245518523_2|title=Lee Seung-gi confirms lead role in upcoming drama 'Hwayugi'|date=November 5, 2017|website=Kpop Herald|access-date=2017-11-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105122709/http://kpopherald.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=201711051421245518523_2|archive-date=2017-11-05|url-status=live}}</ref>\n:An extremely powerful immortal who was exiled to the human world with his powers sealed, due to his mischievous and prideful nature.

Written by the [[Hong sisters]], the drama is a modern spin-off of the Chinese classic novel ''[[Journey to the West]]''. It aired on [[TVN (South Korean TV channel)|tvN]] starting December 23, 2017, every Saturday and Sunday at 21:00 ([[Korea Standard Time|KST]]).\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn 2017, Son Oh-gong and Ma-wang are in conflict with each other as they look for a true light in a dark world where evil thrives. From there, Son Oh-gong is bound to his protective role towards Seon-mi, the little girl he had met years ago. Having made a contract with Seon-mi 25 years ago, entitling her to seek help from Son Oh-gong whenever she calls him in exchange for letting him free, the two meet again in a fateful encounter.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|section|date=January 2019}}\nSeon-mi is a young a girl cursed with the ability to see ghosts and spirits. Her seemingly irrational behavior has isolated her from her family and peers, and her only protection is her grandmother and a small yellow umbrella with protection spells written by a Buddhist monk. One day when she walks home from school, a ghost follows her, and this is witnessed by a mysterious man in a suit and black top hat (Woo Ma-wang). The mysterious man exorcises the ghost for her, and asks her for a favor: to enter a magical house and retrieve a certain fan. She is also given specific instructions to ignore anyone she sees in there. However, the person inside the house is Son Oh-gong, the Monkey King, who was imprisoned inside by Heaven for his crimes. He blocks her path and forces her to acknowledge him, and tells her that the man outside is a great danger to her as well. Oh-gong makes her a deal: if she puts out the five candles on the table and frees him, he promises to protect her from all dangers in her life every time she calls his name. But after she agrees and releases him, Oh-gong steals the memory of his name out of her head and makes a run for it, leaving young Seon-mi stranded in the middle of nowhere.\n\nIn the present day, Seon-mi has grown up into an adult. Still armed with her little magic umbrella, she owns a real estate company that specializes in buying haunted houses, exorcising the spirits, and then flipping them for large profits. At a busy intersection, Seon-mi and Oh-gong spot each other and Seon-mi asks why he did what he did. He gives an unsatisfactory answer and Seon-mi tearfully asks aloud why she ever bothered having faith in him as a child. Meanwhile, Son Oh-gong is looking to reinstate his status as an immortal and has been doing various good deeds to earn brownie points with Heaven. He learns from a possessed doll that Sam-jang has been born, and anyone who eats Sam-jang's flesh can gain immortality. He decides to figure out who it is and eat them. However, Sam-jang is none other than Seon-mi, which means that Oh-gong cannot eat her without violating the promise he made to her as a child that he would protect her. \n\nWhile Oh-gong tries to figure out a way to convince Seon-mi to die for him, Soo Bo-ri goes to Woo Ma-wang and asks him for help in protecting Sam-jang. Ma-wang takes Seon-mi to a antique shop with magical wares. There an old lady (Bodhisattva Guanyin) sells him a Geumganggo, a magical bracelet that will ensure the obedience of anyone who wears it through the power of love. The original Geumganggo is worn on the head, but this version is worn on the wrist. Seon-mi gives it to Oh-gong as a gift on Christmas Eve, and has a prophetic dream about standing in a field, wearing a [[hanbok]], and giving him a kiss. \n\nThis dream comes true when Seon-mi is dragged into a haunted painting by a malevolent spirit that kidnaps women and tries to marry them all. Oh-gong enlists the help of Pal-gye, a pig demon and pop artist under Ma-wang's entertainment company, to get inside the painting. Pal-gye helps him, but he and Ma-wang burn the painting instead, trapping both Seon-mi and Oh-gong inside. Seon-mi decides to follow her dream and kisses Oh-gong, thus activating the Geumganggo, though she did not realize what the Geumganggo would do. Oh-gong gives back her memory of his name and forces her out of the painting world, because he cannot leave the painting world unless she summons him from the outside. Seon-mi cuts her own hand and attracts a hoard of demons to her before calling out Oh-gong's name. Oh-gong exits the painting world and rescues her from the demons.\n\nFrom then on, the main plot is focused on Seon-mi and Oh-gong's budding relationship despite these difficult circumstances. Oh-gong professes to be deeply in love with Seon-mi, but only because of the Geumganggo. He constantly reminds her that if she takes it off, his love will disappear, and he may return to wanting to eat her for immortality instead. Seon-mi, who has been a loner all her life, can't help but be touched by Oh-gong's thoughtful actions, and struggles to guard her heart against any romantic feelings because Samjang's tragic destiny is always to be a sacrifice for humanity against growing evil. Each episode involves Seon-mi and Oh-gong fighting off the demon of the week while dealing with their own internal conflicts. Seon-mi's feelings for Oh-gong are also constantly tested as she learns more about the kind of person Oh-gong is and his many secrets. The nightmare looming constantly over both their heads is a prophetic dream that Seon-mi had about the world ending, and knowing that she had to do everything she could to prevent it. Oh-gong later also learns that his role as Sam-jang's protector means he will either kill her, or she will kill him. This further drives them apart even as they fall more in love with each other.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Lee Seung-gi]] as Son Oh-gong (based on [[Sun Wukong]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kpopherald.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=201711051421245518523_2|title=Lee Seung-gi confirms lead role in upcoming drama 'Hwayugi'|date=November 5, 2017|website=Kpop Herald|access-date=2017-11-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105122709/http://kpopherald.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=201711051421245518523_2|archive-date=2017-11-05|url-status=live}}</ref>\n:An extremely powerful immortal who was exiled to the human world with his powers sealed, due to his mischievous and prideful nature.
