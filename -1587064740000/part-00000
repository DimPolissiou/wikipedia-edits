This put him in a situation where there was a significant gap between his left flank and Sykes' V Corps right flank. This gap made the holding of the federal line a close-run thing. The 17th as part of Birney's Division was pushed forward to occupy the stone wall at the western edge of the Wheat Field abutting the woods there. Only the intervention of the V Corps saved the II Corps from annihilation. 17th Maine saw hot and heavy action being attacked from two sides.

As with many of these volunteers, initially, there were not enough [[Springfield Model 1861|Model 1861 Springfield Rifles]] to go around so they were instead issued imported [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|British Pattern 1853 rifles]]. These were the standard rifle for the British army having performed well in the [[Crimean War]]. The Enfield was a was a .577 calibre [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Mini\u00e9-type]] muzzle-loading [[rifled musket]]. It was used by both armies and was the second most widely used infantry weapon in the Union forces.\n\nAt Gettysburg, on the evening of 3 July, General Birney wanted to standardize the weapons in his division<ref name=\"Houghton\" />. That evening, he had the 17th and other Enfield-equipped units in his command exchange their arms for the standard muzzle-loading rifled musket of the Union Army, the [[Springfield Model 1861]] Rifled Musket. It fired a .58 inch [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Minie Ball.]] and came with a square socket bayonet.

As with many of these volunteers, initially, there were not enough [[Springfield Model 1861|Model 1861 Springfield Rifles]] to go around so they were instead issued imported [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|British Pattern 1853 rifles]]. These were the standard rifle for the British army having performed well in the [[Crimean War]]. The Enfield was a was a .577 calibre [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Mini\u00e9-type]] muzzle-loading [[rifled musket]]. It was used by both armies and was the second most widely used infantry weapon in the Union forces.\n\nAt Gettysburg, on the evening of 3 July, General Birney wanted to standardize the weapons in his division<ref name=\"Houghton\" />. That evening, he had the 17th and other Enfield-equipped units in his command exchange their arms for the standard muzzle-loading rifled musket of the Union Army, the [[Springfield Model 1861]] Rifled Musket. It fired a .58 inch [[Mini\u00e9 rifle|Minie Ball.]] and came with a square socket bayonet. They would carry their Springfields until their end of service.\n\n==Casualties and total strength==\nThe 17th Maine enrolled 1,371 men during its existence.<ref>http://www.state.me.us/sos/arc/archives/military/civilwar/17meinf.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230092433/http://www.state.me.us/sos/arc/archives/military/civilwar/17meinf.htm |date=2006-12-30 }} State of Maine Civil War Records Website</ref> It lost 12 officers and 116 enlisted men killed in action or died of wounds received in battle and an additional 4 officers and 159 enlisted men died of disease.<ref>http://www.civilwararchive.com/Unreghst/unmeinf1.htm Civil War Archive Website, after Dyer</ref>  31 men died in Confederate prisons.

logs. The issue stems from the fact that many apps request permissions to access user's personal information (even if this information is not needed for the app to function) and some users unquestionably grant these permissions. Alternatively, a permission might be listed in the app manifest as required (as opposed to optional) and app would not install unless user grants the permission; user can withdraw any, even required, permission from any app in the device settings after app installation, but few users do this. Google promised to work with developers and create exceptions if their apps require Phone or SMS permissions for \"core app functionality\". The new policies enforcement started on January 6, 2019, 90 days after policy announcement on October 8, 2018. Furthermore, Google announced a new \"target API level requirement\" (<code>targetSdkVersion</code> in manifest) at least Android 8.0 (API level 26) for all new apps and app updates. The API level requirement might combat practice of app developers bypassing some permission screens by specifying early Android versions that had more coarse permission model.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://9to5google.com/2018/10/08/play-store-policy-prevent-leaks/|title=New Play Store policy will help prevent Android call and text data leaks|last=Bradshaw|first=Kyle|date=October 8, 2018|website=9to5Google|language=en-US|access-date=January 16, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/10/providing-safe-and-secure-experience.html|title=Providing a safe and secure experience for our users|website=Android Developers Blog|language=en|access-date=January 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Licensing ==\nThe [[source code]] for Android is [[Open-source software|open-source]]: it is developed in private by Google, with the source code released publicly when a new version of Android is released.

The current stable version is [[Android 10]], released on September 3, 2019. The core Android source code is known as Android Open Source Project (AOSP), which is primarily licensed under the [[Apache License]]. This has allowed variants of Android to be developed on a range of other electronics, such as [[video game console|game consoles]], [[digital camera]]s, [[Personal computer|PCs]] and others, each with a specialized user interface. Some well known derivatives include [[Android TV]] for televisions and [[Wear OS]] for wearables, both developed by Google.\n\nAndroid's source code has been used as the basis of different ecosystems, most notably that of Google which is associated with a suite of [[proprietary software]] called [[Google Mobile Services]] (GMS),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.android.com/gms/|title=Android \u2013 Google Mobile Services|website=Android|language=en-US|quote=While the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) provides common, device-level functionalities such as email and calling, GMS is not part of AOSP.

This includes core apps such as [[Gmail]], the [[digital distribution]] platform [[Google Play]] and associated [[Google Play Services]] development platform, and usually apps such as the [[Google Chrome]] web browser. These apps are licensed by manufacturers of Android devices certified under standards imposed by Google. Other competing Android ecosystems include [[Amazon.com]]'s [[Fire OS]], or [[LineageOS]]. Software distribution is generally offered through proprietary [[application store]]s like [[Google Play Store]] or [[Samsung Galaxy Store]], or open source platforms like [[Aptoide]] or [[F-Droid]], which use software packages in the [[Android application package|APK]] format.\n\nAndroid has been the best-selling OS worldwide on smartphones since 2011 and on tablets since 2013. {{As of|2017|5}}, it has over two billion [[monthly active users]], the largest [[installed base]] of any operating system, and {{as of|2020|01|lc=y}}, the Google Play Store features over 2.9&nbsp;million apps.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/266210/number-of-available-applications-in-the-google-play-store/|title=Number of available applications in the Google Play Store from December 2009 to December 2019 <!--Number of Google Play Store apps 2019 {{!}} Statista -->|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=January 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|Android version history}}\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 250\n | image1 = Android logo (2007-2014).svg\n | alt1 = \n | caption1 = First Android logotype (2007\u20132014)\n | image2 = Android logo (2014).svg\n | alt2 = \n | caption2 = Second Android logotype (2014\u20132019)\n}}\nAndroid Inc. was founded in [[Palo Alto, California]], in October 2003 by [[Andy Rubin]], [[Rich Miner]], Nick Sears, and Chris White.<ref>{{cite web |title=Google's Android OS: Past, Present, and Future |url=http://www.phonearena.com/news/Googles-Android-OS-Past-Present-and-Future_id21273 |website=PhoneArena |date=August 18, 2011 |accessdate=March 12, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313044444/http://www.phonearena.com/news/Googles-Android-OS-Past-Present-and-Future_id21273 |archivedate=March 13, 2017  }}</ref><ref name=\"Google Buys Android\">{{cite web |first=Ben |last=Elgin |title=Google Buys Android for Its Mobile Arsenal |url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/aug2005/tc20050817_0949_tc024.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205190729/http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/aug2005/tc20050817_0949_tc024.htm |website=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] |date=August 17, 2005 |archivedate=February 5, 2011 |accessdate=March 12, 2017}}</ref> Rubin described the Android project as \"tremendous potential in developing smarter mobile devices that are more aware of its owner's location and preferences\".<ref name=\"Google Buys Android\" /> The early intentions of the company were to develop an advanced operating system for [[digital camera]]s, and this was the basis of its pitch to investors in April 2004.<ref name=\"pcworld-camera-os\">{{cite web |first=Jay |last=Alabaster |title=Android founder: We aimed to make a camera OS |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2034723/android-founder-we-aimed-to-make-a-camera-os.html |website=[[PC World]] |publisher=[[International Data Group]] |date=April 16, 2013 |accessdate=May 9, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510103305/http://www.pcworld.com/article/2034723/android-founder-we-aimed-to-make-a-camera-os.html |archivedate=May 10, 2017  }}</ref> The company then decided that the market for cameras was not large enough for its goals, and by five months later it had diverted its efforts and was pitching Android as a handset operating system that would rival [[Symbian]] and Microsoft [[Windows Mobile]].<ref name=\"pcworld-camera-os\" /><ref>{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Welch |title=Before it took over smartphones, Android was originally destined for cameras |url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/16/4230468/android-originally-designed-for-cameras-before-smartphones |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=April 16, 2013 |accessdate=May 9, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429062213/http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/16/4230468/android-originally-designed-for-cameras-before-smartphones |archivedate=April 29, 2017  }}</ref>\n\nRubin had difficulty attracting investors early on, and Android was facing eviction from its office space.

Hiroshi Lockheimer, the Android lead, admitted that \"It's not an ideal situation\", further commenting that the lack of updates is \"the weakest link on security on Android\". Wireless carriers were described in the report as the \"most challenging discussions\", due to their slow approval time while testing on their networks, despite some carriers, including [[Verizon Wireless]] and [[Sprint Corporation]], already shortening their approval times.

Project Treble separates the vendor implementation (device-specific, lower-level software written by silicon manufacturers) from the Android OS framework via a new \"vendor interface\".

logs. The issue stems from the fact that many apps request permissions to access user's personal information (even if this information is not needed for the app to function) and some users unquestionably grant these permissions. Alternatively, a permission might be listed in the app manifest as required (as opposed to optional) and app would not install unless user grants the permission; user can withdraw any, even required, permission from any app in the device settings after app installation, but few users do this. Google promised to work with developers and create exceptions if their apps require Phone or SMS permissions for \"core app functionality\". The new policies enforcement started on January 6, 2019, 90 days after policy announcement on October 8, 2018.

1979) is an American former professional [[basketball]] player. He was drafted 43rd overall by the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] in the [[2000 NBA draft]]. He was born in [[Columbus, Ohio]], where he attended [[West High School (Columbus, Ohio)|West High School]]. He was also a member of the [[U.S. national basketball team]].\n\nStanding {{Convert|6|ft|6|in}} tall and weighing {{Convert|215|lbs}}, Redd spent both his collegiate and professional career at the shooting guard position.\n\n==Early life and education==\nRedd was born on August 24, 1979, in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. In his college years, Redd spent three years leading the offensive attack of [[Ohio State University]] garnering point averages of 21.9, 19.5, and 17.5, respectively. As a sophomore, Redd and [[Scoonie Penn]] led Ohio State to the NCAA Final Four.<ref>Due to rules violations under Ohio State head coach [[Jim O'Brien (basketball, born 1949)|Jim O'Brien]], Ohio State's appearance in this tournament was stricken from NCAA records.</ref> He was then drafted after his junior year in the [[2000 NBA draft]] as a second round pick (43rd overall) by the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\n==Career==\n\n===2000\u20132011: Milwaukee Bucks===\nIn his rookie year, Redd was not able to contribute immediately as he was behind [[National Basketball Association All-Star Game|NBA All-Star]] guard [[Ray Allen]] on the depth chart. Later on, however, it became apparent that he was better than anticipated as proven by accounts that he had played extremely well against Ray Allen, [[Glenn Robinson]], and other teammates in practice. It was then that former Bucks' head coach [[George Karl]] rewarded him with additional playing time. He posted averages of 11.4 points per contest as well as 44.4% on three-point shooting during his second NBA season.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.theintelligencer.com/news/article/Redd-Expected-to-Suit-Up-for-Bucks-10561970.php|title=Redd Expected to Suit Up for Bucks|last=|first=|date=October 16, 2002|work=The Edwardsville Intelligencer|access-date=April 9, 2017|agency=The Associated Press}}</ref> On February 20, 2002, against the [[Houston Rockets]], Redd made eight three-point field goals in the fourth quarter, a then-NBA record.

He chose to stay with the Bucks over leaving for his homestate team, the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], and a chance to play for less money with [[LeBron James]].\n\nIn the [[2006\u201307 NBA season|2006\u201307 season]], Redd had the best season of his career.

Wallace]] in 2012 that a fragmentary papyrus of Mark had been authoritatively dated to the late first century by one of the world's leading paleographers, and might consequently be the earliest surviving Christian text.\n\nFollowing publication in 2018, the Egypt Exploration Society, the owners of the papyrus fragment, released a statement<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.ees.ac.uk/news/poxy-lxxxiii-5345 |title= Statement in response to questions raised about the new fragment of Mark P.Oxy. LXXXIII 5345 |publisher= Egypt Exploration Society |date= 4 June 2018 |access-date= 12 July 2018}}</ref> clarifying both the provenance of the fragment and the role of Dirk Obbink in the circumstances of misleading information subsequently emerging on social media. The EES stated that the text in the fragment had only been recognised as being from the Gospel of Mark in 2011. In an earlier cataloguing in the 1980s by Revel Coles the fragment had been described as 'I/II', which appeared to be the origin of the much discussed assertions of a very early date. In 2011/2012 the papyrus was in the keeping of Dirk Obbink, who had shown it to Scott Carroll, then representing the [[Green Collection]], in connection with a proposal that it might be included in the exhibition of biblical papyri ''Verbum Domini'' at the [[Vatican Library|Vatican]] during Lent and Easter 2012. It was not until the spring of 2016 that the EES realised that the rumoured \"First Century Mark\" papyrus that had become the subject of so much speculation was one and the same as their own fragment P.Oxy. 5345, whereupon Dirk Obbink and Daniela Colomo were requested to prepare it for publication.\n\nIn June 2019, the [[Egypt Exploration Society]] released a further statement<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.ees.ac.uk/news/ees-statement-professor-obbink-and-sales-of-papyri-to-hobby-lobby| title = Professor Obbink and sales of papyri to Hobby Lobby | publisher = Egypt Exploration Society |date = 25 June 2019 |access-date= 25 June 2019}}</ref> following the publication by Professor [[Michael W. Holmes|Michael Holmes]] of the [[Museum of the Bible]] of a contract between Professor Dirk Obbink and [[Hobby Lobby]] dated 17 January 2013 for the sale of a number of fragmentary texts, one of which Professor Holmes identified as P.Oxy. LXXXIII 5345. The Egypt Exploration Society reaffirmed its previous statement that this fragment had never been offered for sale by the EES, while offering the clarification that, in that statement, they had \"simply reported Professor Obbink\u2019s responses to our questions at that time, in which he insisted that he had not sold or offered for sale the Mark fragment to the Green Collection, and that he had not required Professor Wallace to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement in relation to such a sale\".\n\nIn the July/August 2019 issue of ''[[Christianity Today]]'', [[Jerry Pattengale]] wrote an article in which he published for the first time his own perspectives on the 'First Century Mark' saga. Pattengale stated that he had been present with Scott Carroll in Dirk Obbink's rooms in [[Christ Church, Oxford]] in late 2011, when the [[Papyrus 137|<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>137</sup>]] fragment was offered for sale to the [[Museum of the Bible]], which Pattengale then represented.

The EES stated that the text in the fragment had only been recognised as being from the Gospel of Mark in 2011. In an earlier cataloguing in the 1980s by Revel Coles the fragment had been described as 'I/II', which appeared to be the origin of the much discussed assertions of a very early date. In 2011/2012 the papyrus was in the keeping of Dirk Obbink, who had shown it to Scott Carroll, then representing the [[Green Collection]], in connection with a proposal that it might be included in the exhibition of biblical papyri ''Verbum Domini'' at the [[Vatican Library|Vatican]] during Lent and Easter 2012. It was not until the spring of 2016 that the EES realised that the rumoured \"First Century Mark\" papyrus that had become the subject of so much speculation was one and the same as their own fragment P.Oxy. 5345, whereupon Dirk Obbink and Daniela Colomo were requested to prepare it for publication.\n\nIn June 2019, the [[Egypt Exploration Society]] released a further statement<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.ees.ac.uk/news/ees-statement-professor-obbink-and-sales-of-papyri-to-hobby-lobby| title = Professor Obbink and sales of papyri to Hobby Lobby | publisher = Egypt Exploration Society |date = 25 June 2019 |access-date= 25 June 2019}}</ref> following the publication by Professor [[Michael W. Holmes|Michael Holmes]] of the [[Museum of the Bible]] of a contract between Professor Dirk Obbink and [[Hobby Lobby]] dated 17 January 2013 for the sale of a number of fragmentary texts, one of which Professor Holmes identified as P.Oxy. LXXXIII 5345. The Egypt Exploration Society reaffirmed its previous statement that this fragment had never been offered for sale by the EES, while offering the clarification that, in that statement, they had \"simply reported Professor Obbink\u2019s responses to our questions at that time, in which he insisted that he had not sold or offered for sale the Mark fragment to the Green Collection, and that he had not required Professor Wallace to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement in relation to such a sale\".\n\nIn the July/August 2019 issue of ''[[Christianity Today]]'', [[Jerry Pattengale]] wrote an article in which he published for the first time his own perspectives on the 'First Century Mark' saga. Pattengale stated that he had been present with Scott Carroll in Dirk Obbink's rooms in [[Christ Church, Oxford]] in late 2011, when the [[Papyrus 137|<math>\\mathfrak{P}</math><sup>137</sup>]] fragment was offered for sale to the [[Museum of the Bible]], which Pattengale then represented. Also offered for sale were fragments of the Gospels of Matthew, Luke and John, all of which Dirk Obbink had then proposed as likely to be of a second century date, while the Mark fragment was presented as more likely first century. According to Pattengale, he had undertaken due diligence in showing images of the four fragments to selected New Testament textual scholars, including [[Daniel B. Wallace]] \u2013 subject to their signing non-disclosure agreements in accordance with Dirk Obbink's stipulations; and the purchase was eventually finalised, with the fragments agreed to remain in Professor Obbink's possession for research prior to publication.

He was educated at the [[Royal Belfast Academical Institution]] and then at [[Queen's University Belfast|Queen's University]], Belfast, studying science in his first year then switching to philosophy, obtaining a BA (hons) in 1921.  In preparation for ordination in the Anglican Church he then studied theology at [[Ridley Hall, Cambridge]].  He later studied anthropology and Chinese at [[Hong Kong University]] and obtained an MA in the history and philosophy of religion and in Chinese studies from [[Leeds University]].  As a young priest he travelled widely, serving in parishes in Doncaster, Ispwich, Hong Kong, and Leeds before settling in Cambridge in 1943 where he lived for the rest of his life.\n\nHe married Eunice Joan Uttley in 1940, and had two sons.  He died in December 1978.\n\nAs an ornithologist, he was known for his study of bird behaviour and his intensive study of the [[Eurasian wren|wren]] (''Troglodytes troglodytes'').  He travelled to many islands - including the [[Shetland Islands]], Iceland, and St Kilda - to study the wren. In the 1960s he travelled to East Africa to study and to record 'duetting' in birds.  He published a number of ornithological texts including ''Birds of the Grey Wind'' (1940), ''Bird display and behaviour'' (1942), ''The Way Birds Live'' (1943), the [[New Naturalist]] monograph ''The Wren'' (1955), ''The folklore of birds: an enquiry into the origin and distribution of some magico-religious traditions'' (1958), ''The Study of Bird Song'' (1963) and ''The Life and Lore of the Bird'' (1975).  He also published two theological works books related to his work as a priest, ''The Gospel Parables'' (1967) and ''Saint Francis: Nature Mystic ''(1973), and a book which was initially intended as an assessment of how good a naturalist Shakespeare was, ''Shakespeare\u2019s imagination: A study of the psychology of association and inspiration'' (1946).  He eventually demonstrated that Shakespeare was no naturalist at all!\n\nHe was awarded the [[Burroughs Medal]] in the United States in 1942 for his book about his childhood in Ireland, ''Birds of the Grey Wind''.  In 1951 he became a Corresponding Fellow of the [[American Ornithologists' Union]] and received an honorary MA from [[Cambridge University]].  In 1952 he became a member of [[Jesus College, Cambridge]].  In 1959 he received the Special Union Gold Medal of the [[British Ornithologists\u2019 Union]] on the occasion of that organisation's Centenary celebrations.  He was Vice President of the British Ornithologists\u2019 Union from 1963 to 1965.  In 1966 he received the [[Stamford Raffles Award]] of the [[Zoological Society of London]] for \u2018distinguished contributions to ornithology\u2019.\n\n==References==\n*Armstrong, P.H. (2000).

He was educated at the [[Royal Belfast Academical Institution]] and then at [[Queen's University Belfast|Queen's University]], Belfast, studying science in his first year then switching to philosophy, obtaining a BA (hons) in 1921.  In preparation for ordination in the Anglican Church he then studied theology at [[Ridley Hall, Cambridge]].  He later studied anthropology and Chinese at [[Hong Kong University]] and obtained an MA in the history and philosophy of religion and in Chinese studies from [[Leeds University]].  As a young priest he travelled widely, serving in parishes in Doncaster, Ispwich, Hong Kong, and Leeds before settling in Cambridge in 1943 where he lived for the rest of his life.\n\nHe married Eunice Joan Uttley in 1940, and had two sons.  He died in December 1978.\n\nAs an ornithologist, he was known for his study of bird behaviour and his intensive study of the [[Eurasian wren|wren]] (''Troglodytes troglodytes'').  He travelled to many islands - including the [[Shetland Islands]], Iceland, and St Kilda - to study the wren. In the 1960s he travelled to East Africa to study and to record 'duetting' in birds.  He published a number of ornithological texts including ''Birds of the Grey Wind'' (1940), ''Bird display and behaviour'' (1942), ''The Way Birds Live'' (1943), the [[New Naturalist]] monograph ''The Wren'' (1955), ''The folklore of birds: an enquiry into the origin and distribution of some magico-religious traditions'' (1958), ''The Study of Bird Song'' (1963) and ''The Life and Lore of the Bird'' (1975).  He also published two theological works books related to his work as a priest, ''The Gospel Parables'' (1967) and ''Saint Francis: Nature Mystic ''(1973), and a book which was initially intended as an assessment of how good a naturalist Shakespeare was, ''Shakespeare\u2019s imagination: A study of the psychology of association and inspiration'' (1946).  He eventually demonstrated that Shakespeare was no naturalist at all!\n\nHe was awarded the [[Burroughs Medal]] in the United States in 1942 for his book about his childhood in Ireland, ''Birds of the Grey Wind''.  In 1951 he became a Corresponding Fellow of the [[American Ornithologists' Union]] and received an honorary MA from [[Cambridge University]].  In 1952 he became a member of [[Jesus College, Cambridge]].  In 1959 he received the Special Union Gold Medal of the [[British Ornithologists\u2019 Union]] on the occasion of that organistation's Centenary celebrations.  He was Vice President of the British Ornithologists\u2019 Union from 1963 to 1965.  In 1966 he received the [[Stamford Raffles Award]] of the [[Zoological Society of London]] for \u2018distinguished contributions to ornithology\u2019.\n\n==References==\n*Armstrong, P.H. (2000).
