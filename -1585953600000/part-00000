Although vaguely drawn, Alain is less dated as a type than many a humanistic figure projected by better known writers of the 1930s.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=Balakian|first=Anna|authorlink=Anna Balakian|date=1965-04-03|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/SaturdayRev-1965apr03-00042|title=Hate the World, Destroy the Self|work=[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|The Saturday Review]]|page=42|accessdate=2015-08-13}}</ref> ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' described the novel as \"piquant, perverse, and rather sterile\", and wrote: \"La Rochelle handles this with a certain boutique decadence and a tired resignation (the novel is subtitled 'autobiographical') which is true to the experience ... but perhaps self-defeating to the book.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/pierre-drieu-la-rochelle/the-fire-within-2/|title=The Fire Within|work=[[Kirkus Reviews]]|date=1965|accessdate=2015-08-13}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\nThe book was adapted for film by [[Louis Malle]] as ''[[The Fire Within]]'', starring [[Maurice Ronet]] and released in 1963.<ref name=frey /> It was also the basis for the 2011 Norwegian film ''[[Oslo, August 31st]]'', directed by [[Joachim Trier]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Macaulay|first=Scott|date=2012-01-16|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/37482-city-limits-2/|title=City Limits|work=[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker]]|accessdate=2015-03-01}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.gallimard.fr/Catalogue/GALLIMARD/Blanche/Le-Feu-Follet Publicity page] at [[\u00c9ditions Gallimard]]'s website {{in lang|fr}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Will O the Wisp}}\n[[Category:1931 French novels]]\n[[Category:French novels adapted into films]]\n[[Category:French-language novels]]\n[[Category:Novels about drugs]]\n[[Category:Novels by Pierre Drieu La Rochelle]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Paris]]\n[[Category:Suicide in fiction]]\n", "name_user": "If I could keep it for myself", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_O%27_the_Wisp_(novel)"}

The script was later used as the basis for the AI in ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2|Modern Warfare 2]]''.<ref name=\"Evans-Thirlwell 2016\" />\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Initial reception ===\n''[[Official Xbox Magazine]]''{{'s}} Ryan McCaffrey appraised \"All Ghillied Up\" and noted it was the best level in the game and one of the best stealth levels in gaming. He commended the section where the player has to lie in a grassy field while a platoon, including tanks, walks past for its high tension.<ref name=\"McCaffrey 2007\" />\n\n=== Retrospective commentary ===\nGB Buford of ''[[Kotaku]]'' called \"All Ghillied Up\" one of the best levels in video game history, citing its heavy freedom of choice in approaching the level.<ref name=\"Burford 2014\" /> Comparing it to the game's previous level, \"Safehouse\", he remarked that while the player's commanding officer could be obeyed to get through the level successfully, the player could also win by disobeying his orders and he will still back up the player, rather than simply killing the player for failing to obey.<ref name=\"Burford 2014\" /> He also complemented the \"incredibly tense\" prone section as implementing the mechanic in an interesting way.<ref name=\"Burford 2014\" /> ''[[PC Gamer]]'' said \"All Ghillied Up\" was one of the strongest levels in ''Modern Warfare'' and that it \"demonstrates the real craft of a linear story-driven first-person shooter\". They went on to compare it to ''[[DayZ (mod)|DayZ]]'' with its equally dramatic scenarios and allowing for \"personality and freeform set pieces\".<ref name=\"PC Gamer 2014\" />\n\n''[[IGN]]'' called the level one of the best stealth missions in games,<ref name=\"Dyer 2015\" /> and ''[[Digital Trends]]'' described it as among the greatest in any first-person shooter.\"<ref name=\"Gabe 2017\" /> ''[[Ars Technica]]''{{'s}} Sam White compared the level's atmosphere and tension to that seen in the ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'' series.<ref name=\"White 2016\" /> Sam Sant of ''[[Game Revolution]]'' said it was one of gaming's most iconic missions, also noting the ghillie suits worn in the mission were a fan favourite.<ref name=\"Sam 2019\" /> In a 2019 poll of ''[[LADbible]]'' readers, \"All Ghillied Up\" was voted the best Call of Duty mission with 67% (6,180) of the votes above \"Vendetta\" from ''[[Call of Duty: World at War|World at War]]'' and \"[[Vorkuta gulag|Vorkuta]]\" from ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops|Black Ops]]''.<ref name=\"Hardiman 2019\" />\n\n== Legacy ==\n\"All Ghillied Up\" was referenced in the movie ''[[Hardcore Henry]]'', whose director called it \"one of the best levels of all time\".<ref name=\"Peckham 2016\" /> In 2019's ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019 video game)|Call of Duty: Modern Warfare]]'', a soft reboot of the sub series, players can unlock the \"All Ghillied Up\" pack which allows players to wear a [[ghillie suit]] and wield a [[Sniper rifle|bolt-action sniper rifle]], in camouflage with additional netting and

One instance of this is found near that start of the level, once the player passes the abandoned [[churchyard]], the Captain will warn of an enemy [[Military helicopter|helicopter]] flying above telling the player get down. However, the player can choose to shoot the helicopter down using a [[FIM-92 Stinger]] found in the church and the Captain will say \"now you're just showin' off.\"\n\n===Plot===\n{{multiple image\n|align        = right\n| footer      = \"All Ghillied Up\" is set in [[Pripyat, Ukraine]].

MacMillan responds to the behavior of the player, criticising Price when he ruins their cover and correcting the player character when he aims at the incorrect target. The mission ends with MacMillan and Price setting up in the abandoned [[Polissya hotel]] preparing for an [[assassination]].<ref name=\"Original game\" /><ref name=\"Remastered game\" /><ref name=\"Wordsworth 2015\" /> The next mission, \"One Shot, One Kill\", concludes with a failed assassination attempt, a hurried retreat, and a final stand-off in front of the [[Pripyat amusement park]] ferris wheel.<ref name=\"Original game\" /><ref name=\"Remastered game\" /><ref name=\"Payne 2016\" /> \"All Ghillied Up\" introduces parallels between Captain Price and the game's main player character [[Soap MacTavish]].<ref name=\"White 2016\" />\n\n== Development ==\n\"All Ghillied Up\" was designed by [[Mohammad Alavi (game developer)|Mohammad Alavi]], who also designed \"Crew Expendable\", another level in ''[[Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare|Modern Warfare]]'', and \"[[No Russian]]\", a controversial level in the sequel ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]''.<ref name=\"Evans-Thirlwell 2016\" /><ref name=\"Shea 2019\" /> The level was based on game mechanics used in ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' and ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]''.<ref name=\"Evans-Thirlwell 2016\" /> In it, [[non-player character]]s (NPCs) react differently to the player based on distance and angle, rather than a simple proximity trigger.<ref name=\"Evans-Thirlwell 2016\" /> For example, a player might lie prone in the grass and an enemy will not notice them.<ref name=\"Evans-Thirlwell 2016\" /> This code was created in secret by Alavi due to the difficulty of explaining its intricacies to the AI programmer, who was already swamped with work.<ref name=\"Evans-Thirlwell 2016\" /> Alavi called the internal code \"garbage\", but said that it still \"did exactly what [he] wanted it to do\", and that he did not \"have to compromise on the feel of the gameplay\".<ref name=\"Evans-Thirlwell 2016\" />\n\nIt took Alavi three months and more than 10,000 lines of code to make the first minute of gameplay for the level.<ref name=\"Evans-Thirlwell 2016\" /> The lead designer, Steve Fukuda, played the first minute ten different ways and had fun each time, making Alavi consider it a success. The script was later used as the basis for the AI in ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2|Modern Warfare 2]]''.<ref name=\"Evans-Thirlwell 2016\" />\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Initial reception ===\n''[[Official Xbox Magazine]]''{{'s}} Ryan McCaffrey appraised \"All Ghillied Up\" and noted it was the best level in the game and one of the best stealth levels in gaming. He commended the section where the player has to lie in a grassy field while a platoon, including tanks, walks past for its high tension.<ref name=\"McCaffrey 2007\" />\n\n=== Retrospective commentary ===\nGB Buford of ''[[Kotaku]]'' called \"All Ghillied Up\" one of the best levels in video game history, citing its heavy freedom of choice in approaching the level.<ref name=\"Burford 2014\" /> Comparing it to the game's previous level, \"Safehouse\", he remarked that while the player's commanding officer could be obeyed to get through the level successfully, the player could also win by disobeying his orders and he will still back up the player, rather than simply killing the player for failing to obey.<ref name=\"Burford 2014\" /> He also complemented the \"incredibly tense\" prone section as implementing the mechanic in an interesting way.<ref name=\"Burford 2014\" /> ''[[PC Gamer]]'' said \"All Ghillied Up\" was one of the strongest levels in ''Modern Warfare'' and that it \"demonstrates the real craft of a linear story-driven first-person shooter\". They went on to compare it to ''[[DayZ (mod)|DayZ]]'' with its equally dramatic scenarios and allowing for \"personality and freeform set pieces\".<ref name=\"PC Gamer 2014\" />\n\n''[[IGN]]'' called the level one of the best stealth missions in games,<ref name=\"Dyer 2015\" /> and ''[[Digital Trends]]'' described it as among the greatest in any first-person shooter.\"<ref name=\"Gabe 2017\" /> ''[[Ars Technica]]''{{'s}} Sam White compared the level's atmosphere and tension to that seen in the ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'' series.<ref name=\"White 2016\" /> Sam Sant of ''[[Game Revolution]]'' said it was one of gaming's most iconic missions, also noting the ghillie suits worn in the mission were a fan favourite.<ref name=\"Sam 2019\" /> In a 2019 poll of ''[[LADbible]]'' readers, \"All Ghillied Up\" was voted the best Call of Duty mission with 67% (6,180) of the votes above \"Vendetta\" from ''[[Call of Duty: World at War|World at War]]'' and \"[[Vorkuta gulag|Vorkuta]]\" from ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops|Black Ops]]''.<ref name=\"Hardiman 2019\" />\n\n== Legacy ==\n\"All Ghillied Up\" was referenced in the movie ''[[Hardcore Henry]]'', whose director called it \"one of the best levels of all time\".<ref name=\"Peckham 2016\" /> In 2019's ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019 video game)|Call of Duty: Modern Warfare]]'', a soft reboot of the sub series, players can unlock the \"All Ghillied Up\" pack which allows players to wear a [[ghillie suit]] and wield a [[Sniper rifle|bolt-action sniper rifle]], in camouflage with additional netting and

''H. erectus'' was the first fossil [[hominin]] found as a result of a directed expedition.\n\nExcavated from the bank of the [[Solo River]] at [[Trinil]], [[East Java]], he first allocated the material to a genus of fossil chimpanzees as ''Anthropopithecus erectus'', then the following year assigned it to a new genus as ''[[Pithecanthropus]] erectus'' (the genus name had been coined by [[Ernst Haeckel]] in 1868 for the hypothetical link between humans and fossil Apes).
