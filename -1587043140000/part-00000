Of note is the return of the series to [[Richmond Raceway]] for the first time since 2005, which comes at the expense of the spring Martinsville date. Martinsville in exchange was given an Xfinity Series race for the first time after a hiatus for 24 of the last 25 years (the exception being [[Goody's 250|a single event]] in [[2006 NASCAR Busch Series|2006]]), which will be run in the fall on the same weekend as the Cup and Truck Series races there. Also, this will be the first season that the season finale will be at [[Phoenix Raceway]] while [[Homestead\u2013Miami Speedway]] moves to March after Atlanta to become the fourth race of the season. Bristol is now the elimination race for the Round of 10 while the second Las Vegas race is the opener for the Round of 8 and Martinsville, now with only one date on the schedule, will end the Round of 8.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://beyondtheflag.com/2019/04/05/nascar-2020-truck-series-schedule-revealed/|title=NASCAR: 2020 Truck Series schedule revealed|date=April 5, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://racingnews.co/2019/04/03/2020-nascar-truck-series-schedule-xfinity-schedule/|title=2020 NASCAR Truck Series Schedule & Xfinity Schedule|date=April 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://us.motorsport.com/nascar-xs/news/2020-xfinity-truck-series-schedules/4364433/|title=New races on 2020 NASCAR Xfinity and Truck series schedules|website=us.motorsport.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.frontstretch.com/2019/04/03/truckin-thursdays-nascar-reveals-2020-truck-series-schedule/|title=Truckin\u2019 Thursdays: NASCAR Reveals 2020 Truck Series Schedule|date=April 4, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nascar.nbcsports.com/2019/09/24/nascar-announces-start-times-for-2020-cup-xfinity-and-truck-races/|title=NASCAR reveals start times for 2020 Cup, Xfinity and Truck races|first=Dustin|last=Long|date=September 24, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://autoweek.com/article/nascar/nascar-reveals-revamped-trucks-and-xfinity-schedules-2020|title=NASCAR reveals revamped Trucks and Xfinity schedules for 2020|date=April 3, 2019|website=Autoweek}}</ref>\n\n===Changes due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic===\n*The [[Vet Tix/Camping World 200]] at [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]] and the [[Ford EcoBoost 200|Miami 200]] at [[Homestead\u2013Miami Speedway]] were originally announced on March 12, 2020 due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus (COVID-19)]] pandemic to take place without fans in attendance, but one day later on March 13, 2020, NASCAR announced that the two Cup races (including support races) would be postponed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2020/03/13/nascar-statement-on-atlanta-miami-race-events/ |title=NASCAR statement on Atlanta, Miami race events |website=NASCAR.com |publisher=NASCAR Digital Media, LLC. |date=March 13, 2020 |accessdate=March 17, 2020}}</ref>\n* On March 16, 2020, NASCAR announced all race events through May 3 have been postponed due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.<ref>{{cite web |title=NASCAR statement: All race events through May 3 postponed |url=https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2020/03/16/nascar-schedule-update-statement-race-coronavirus/ |website=NASCAR.com |publisher=NASCAR Digital Media, LLC. |date=March 16, 2020 |accessdate=March 17, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Results and standings==\n\n===Race results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!

The season began at [[Daytona International Speedway]] with the [[NextEra Energy 250]] on February 14. The regular season will end with the [[Corrigan Oil 200]] at [[Michigan International Speedway]] on August 8. The [[NASCAR playoffs]] will end with the [[Lucas Oil 150]] at [[Phoenix Raceway]] on November 6.\n\n2020 marks the twelfth season for [[Camping World|Camping World Holdings]] as the series' sponsor, with it being the second season under the [[Gander Outdoors|Gander RV & Outdoors]] brand. In September 2019, Camping World announced a rebranding of Gander Outdoors stores as part of a shift in strategy, resulting in the stores also carrying recreational vehicle sales and service, henceforth the slight name change to reflect corporate changes.<ref>{{cite web|last=McFadin|first=Daniel|url=https://nascar.nbcsports.com/2019/11/19/truck-series-gets-minor-name-change-for-2020/|title=Truck Series gets minor name change for 2020|publisher=[[NBC Sports]]|date=November 19, 2019|accessdate=November 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe early season was headlined by incentives for any driver to beat [[Kyle Busch]] in four of the races he participated in. After Busch won the race at Las Vegas, the first of his five Truck starts in 2020, which was his seventh series start in a row where he won, [[Kevin Harvick]] and Gander RV & Outdoors CEO [[Marcus Lemonis]] each offered $50,000 for any full-time Cup Series regular if they were to finish higher than Busch in his remaining four starts of the year.

Of note is the return of the series to [[Richmond Raceway]] for the first time since 2005, which comes at the expense of the spring Martinsville date. Martinsville in exchange was given an Xfinity Series race for the first time after a hiatus for 24 of the last 25 years (the exception being [[Goody's 250|a single event]] in [[2006 NASCAR Busch Series|2006]]), which will be run in the fall on the same weekend as the Cup and Truck Series races there. Also, this will be the first season that the season finale will be at [[Phoenix Raceway]] while [[Homestead\u2013Miami Speedway]] moves to March after Atlanta to become the fourth race of the season. Bristol is now the elimination race for the Round of 10 while the second Las Vegas race is the opener for the Round of 8 and Martinsville, now with only one date on the schedule, will end the Round of 8.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://beyondtheflag.com/2019/04/05/nascar-2020-truck-series-schedule-revealed/|title=NASCAR: 2020 Truck Series schedule revealed|date=April 5, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://racingnews.co/2019/04/03/2020-nascar-truck-series-schedule-xfinity-schedule/|title=2020 NASCAR Truck Series Schedule & Xfinity Schedule|date=April 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://us.motorsport.com/nascar-xs/news/2020-xfinity-truck-series-schedules/4364433/|title=New races on 2020 NASCAR Xfinity and Truck series schedules|website=us.motorsport.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.frontstretch.com/2019/04/03/truckin-thursdays-nascar-reveals-2020-truck-series-schedule/|title=Truckin\u2019 Thursdays: NASCAR Reveals 2020 Truck Series Schedule|date=April 4, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nascar.nbcsports.com/2019/09/24/nascar-announces-start-times-for-2020-cup-xfinity-and-truck-races/|title=NASCAR reveals start times for 2020 Cup, Xfinity and Truck races|first=Dustin|last=Long|date=September 24, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://autoweek.com/article/nascar/nascar-reveals-revamped-trucks-and-xfinity-schedules-2020|title=NASCAR reveals revamped Trucks and Xfinity schedules for 2020|date=April 3, 2019|website=Autoweek}}</ref>\n\n===Changes due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic===\n*The [[Vet Tix/Camping World 200]] at [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]] and the [[Ford EcoBoost 200|Miami 200]] at [[Homestead\u2013Miami Speedway]] were originally announced on March 12, 2020 due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus (COVID-19)]] pandemic to take place without fans in attendance, but one day later on March 13, 2020, NASCAR announced that the two Cup races (including support races) would be postponed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2020/03/13/nascar-statement-on-atlanta-miami-race-events/ |title=NASCAR statement on Atlanta, Miami race events |website=NASCAR.com |publisher=NASCAR Digital Media, LLC. |date=March 13, 2020 |accessdate=March 17, 2020}}</ref>\n* On March 16, 2020, NASCAR announced all race events through May 3 have been postponed due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.<ref>{{cite web |title=NASCAR statement: All race events through May 3 postponed |url=https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2020/03/16/nascar-schedule-update-statement-race-coronavirus/ |website=NASCAR.com |publisher=NASCAR Digital Media, LLC. |date=March 16, 2020 |accessdate=March 17, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Results and standings==\n\n===Race results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!
