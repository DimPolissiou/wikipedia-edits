Henderson had seen a demonstration of the Drinker respirator in the early 1930s, and built a device of his own upon his return to Scotland. Four weeks after its construction, the Henderson respirator was used to save the life of a 10-year-old boy from New Deer, Aberdeenshire, who was suffering from poliomyelitis. Despite this success, Henderson was reprimanded for secretly using hospital facilities to build the machine.<ref name=\"Wills\">{{cite book| last=Wills| first=Elspeth| title=Scottish Firsts: A Celebration of Innovation and Achievement| publisher=[[Mainstream Publishing]]| location=Edinburgh| year=2002| pages=[https://archive.org/details/scottishfirstsce00will/page/51 51\u20132]| isbn=978-1840186116| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/scottishfirstsce00will/page/51}}</ref><ref name=\"Thomas\">{{cite web| last=Thomas| first=Campbell| date=15 February 2000| url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/dr-robert-henderson-1.249085| title=Dr Robert Henderson | work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]| accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Both respirator==\n[[File:Both Cabinet Respirator in WWII.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Both cabinet respirator being used to treat a patient at the 110th Australian Military Hospital in 1943]]\n{{main|Both respirator}}\nThe [[Both respirator]], a negative pressure ventilator, was invented in 1937 when Australia's epidemic of poliomyelitis created an immediate need for more ventilating machines to compensate for respiratory paralysis. Although the Drinker model was effective and saved lives, its widespread use was hindered by the fact that the machines were very large, heavy (about 750 lbs), bulky, and expensive. In the US, an adult machine cost about $2000 in 1930, and \u00a32000 delivered to Melbourne in 1936. The cost in Europe in the mid-1950s was around \u00a31500.

Most patients with paralysis of the breathing muscles use modern [[mechanical ventilation|mechanical ventilators]] that push air into the airway with positive pressure. These are generally efficacious and have the advantage of not restricting patients' movements or caregivers' ability to examine the patients as significantly as an iron lung does. However, [[wikt:negative pressure|negative pressure]] ventilation is a truer approximation of normal physiological breathing and results in more normal distribution of air in the lungs. It may also be preferable in certain rare conditions, such as [[central hypoventilation syndrome]], in which failure of the medullary respiratory centers at the base of the brain results in patients having no [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic control]] of breathing.
