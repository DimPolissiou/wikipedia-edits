The other films are primarily hand-drawn and related to the television series. The first three films were localized into English and compiled into a single film, ''[[Digimon: The Movie]]''. Subsequent films up to ''[[Digimon Frontier: Island of Lost Digimon]]'' were also released in English as well.

In the village of humanoid Digimon, Takuya, J.P., and Tommy learn from Kotemon of a legend that the island was protected by their god Ornismon. Kotemon proceeds to take them to a neutral location where his friend Bearmon brought Koji and Zoe after they ended up in his village. After the two sides argue what they learned, Bearmon and Kotemon lead them to a mural of Ornismon with Bokomon deeming the DigiCode to be incomplete. Their peaceful meeting is broken up as Kotemon and Bearmon's older brothers, Dinohyumon and Grizzlymon, appear and battle each other.

Zoe, Tommy, J.P, Bokomon, and Neemon help many Fresh Digimon assemble the writing under the mural. But upon its completion, Bokomon deciphers that Ornismon is actually an evil Digimon that oppressed the island before being sealed away by the Ancient Warriors\u2014AncientGreymon and AncientGarurumon. Furthermore, after the group notices a missing piece in the mural that is identical to the ornament both d'Arcmon and Hippogriffomon possess, J.P. and Zoe proceed to inform Takuya and Koji while the others stay behind in hope that they can find an answer to the crisis.\n\nOn the battlefield, Takuya and Koji eventually spirit evolve to BurningGreymon and Lobomon to stop the war, but end up getting both sides to turn on them before Kazemon and Beetlemon arrive.

Exposed while forced to become d'Arcmon again, the fraud confesses to have been collecting the Fractal Code from the many fallen Digimon to revive and control Ornismon while assuming his true form: Murmukusmon. Overpowering the Legendary Warriors, Murmukusmon guides Ornismon to the murals of AncientGreymon and AncientGarurumon, which begin shining. Kotemon gives his life to protect them, and Bearmon's tears along with Kotemon's sacrifice summons spectral forms of the Ancient Warriors. Their appearance gives the DigiDestined a second wind with the island residents joining them as Agunimon takes out Murmukusmon before the Legendary Warriors destroy Ornismon for good. With Ornismon no more, the Lost Island returns to the Digital World with the two sides finally making peace with Kotemon turning up alive as he and Bearmon have a reunion.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==''Digimon Data Squad'' films==\n\n===Ultimate Power!

Creating a smaller, new Digital World via Project Ark, Yggdrasil learns a small group of Digimon have gained a vaccine called the X-Antibody, that makes them immune to the X-Program, and upgrades them with new abilities and appearances. Yggdrasil dispatches its guards, the Royal Knights, to exterminate the X-Digimon. The Royal Knights consists of the merciless, loyal Omnimon, his best friend Gallantmon who questions Yggdrasil's motives, and the quiet Magnamon.\n\nDorumon, a dragon-like Digimon and X-Antibody carrier, does not understand the prejudice from other Digimon. He is targeted by a Leomon for his X-Antibody, but Leomon is struck by [[lightning]] and dies, asking Dorumon to live for him. Omnimon is summoned to a meeting between regular Digimon and X-Digimon, but he exterminates all of them save WarGreymon X and a Tokomon. The two crashland near a temple where Dorumon lives, WarGreymon X leaving Tokomon in Dorumon's care whilst he lures Omnimon away. Dorumon witnesses Omnimon exterminate a herd of Digimon who oppose Yggdrasil's will before being targeted himself. WarGreymon X and MetalGarurumon X arrive, but the latter is killed, though not before giving his X-Antibody to a wounded Tokomon.\n\nDorumon digivolves into his Champion-level Dorugamon, but Gallantmon arrives, revealing to Omnimon that Project Ark's second phase involves wiping out all Digimon, something which he refuses to participate in. Omnimon and Gallantmon duel, but Gallantmon allows himself to be killed so he can discern the truth, leaving Omnimon confused. Magnamon capture Dorugamon on Yggdrasil's command, revealing Dorumon is an experiment. Data is extracted from Dorugamon, used to create an army of DexDoruGreymon while Dorugamon is dumped in a [[wrecking yard]] where he is found by resistance members Mummymon and Wizardmon. Yggdrasil's horde attacks the group's base, but WarGreymon X and a revived MetalGarurumon X help protect it. Dorugamon awakens, digivolving into DoruGreymon, resembling the attacking horde. Gallantmon returns as an X-Digimon, opening a portal for DoruGreymon to confront Yggdrasil.\n\nDoruGreymon confronts Magnamon and a disillusioned Omnimon. DoruGreymon digivolves into his Mega-level Alphamon, a legendary missing Royal Knight. Alphamon and Omnimon join forces to face Yggdrasil, but the loyal Magnamon warns his master of their arrival. In Yggdrasil's core, the Knights get nowhere with answers, and have to battle Alphamon's counterpart Dexmon. Alphamon impales himself and Dexmon using his own sword, and gives his X-Antibody to Omnimon, who successfully slays Yggdrasil. In the rebooted Digital World, Omnimon and Gallantmon muse over Yggdrasil's choices, concluding it merely wanted to live in the Digital World but it was too complex for it. Alphamon survives as Dorumon, reuniting with Tokomon.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Digimon}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of Digimon Films}}\n[[Category:Digimon lists|Films]]\n[[Category:Toei Animation films]]\n[[Category:Lists of anime films|Digimon]]\n[[Category:Digimon films|Digimon films]]\n[[Category:Animated films based on animated series]]\n[[Category:Lists of films by franchise]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Digimon'' films}}\nSeveral films have been released in the ''[[Digimon]]'' franchise.

In the village of humanoid Digimon, Takuya, J.P., and Tommy learn from Kotemon of a legend that the island was protected by their god Ornismon. Kotemon proceeds to take them to a neutral location where his friend Bearmon brought Koji and Zoe after they ended up in his village. After the two sides argue what they learned, Bearmon and Kotemon lead them to a mural of Ornismon with Bokomon deeming the DigiCode to be incomplete. Their peaceful meeting is broken up as Kotemon and Bearmon's older brothers, Dinohyumon and Grizzlymon, appear and battle each other. But after Takuya and Koji spirit evolve to Agunimon and KendoGarurumon to stop them, the respective brothers walk away.\n\nAs the human Digimon prepare for battle when their leader d'Arcmon rallies the crowd, Takuya reluctantly accepts Dinohyumon's recruitment offer to allow Tommy to escape with Kotemon. A similar event with J.P. and Zoe spiriting Bearmon occurs at the beast Digimon village as Koji accepts Grizzlymon's offer during a speech by the beast Digimons' leader Hippogriffomon. Zoe, Tommy, J.P, Bokomon, and Neemon help many Fresh Digimon assemble the writing under the mural. But upon its completion, Bokomon deciphers that Ornismon is actually an evil Digimon that oppressed the island before being sealed away by the Anicent Warriors\u2014AncientGreymon and AncientGarurumon. Furthermore, after the group notices a missing piece in the mural that is identical to the ornament both d'Arcmon and Hippogriffomon possess, J.P. and Zoe proceed to inform Takuya and Koji while the others stay behind in hope that they can find an answer to the crisis.\n\nOn the battlefield, Takuya and Koji eventually spirit evolve to BurningGreymon and Lobomon to stop the war, but end up getting both sides to turn on them before Kazemon and Beetlemon arrive. The two revealed that on their way, they discovered a horrible secret: the two armies' leader being the same Digimon when catching d'Arcmon transform into Hippogriffomon. Exposed while forced to become d'Arcmon again, the fraud confesses to have been collecting the Fractal Code from the many fallen Digimon to revive and control Ornismon while assuming his true form: Murmukusmon. Overpowering the Legendary Warriors, Murmukusmon guides Ornismon to the murals of AncientGreymon and AncientGarurumon, which begin shining. Kotemon gives his life to protect them, and Bearmon's tears along with Kotemon's sacrifice summons spectral forms of the Ancient Warriors. Their appearance gives the DigiDestined a second wind with the island residents joining them as Agunimon takes out Murmukusmon before the Legendary Warriors destroy Ornismon for good. With Ornismon no more, the Lost Island returns to the Digital World with the two sides finally making peace with Kotemon turning up alive as he and Bearmon have a reunion.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==''Digimon Data Squad'' films==\n\n===Ultimate Power!

Creating a smaller, new Digital World via Project Ark, Yggdrasil learns a small group of Digimon have gained a vaccine called the X-Antibody, that makes them immune to the X-Program, and upgrades them with new abilities and appearances. Yggdrasil dispatches its guards, the Royal Knights, to exterminate the X-Digimon. The Royal Knights consists of the merciless, loyal Omnimon, his best friend Gallantmon who questions Yggdrasil's motives, and the quiet Magnamon.\n\nDorumon, a dragon-like Digimon and X-Antibody carrier, does not understand the prejudice from other Digimon. He is targeted by a Leomon for his X-Antibody, but Leomon is struck by [[lightning]] and dies, asking Dorumon to live for him. Omnimon is summoned to a meeting between regular Digimon and X-Digimon, but he exterminates all of them save WarGreymon X and a Tokomon. The two crashland near a temple where Dorumon lives, WarGreymon X leaving Tokomon in Dorumon's care whilst he lures Omnimon away. Dorumon witnesses Omnimon exterminate a herd of Digimon who oppose Yggdrasil's will before being targeted himself. WarGreymon X and MetalGarurumon X arrive, but the latter is killed, though not before giving his X-Antibody to a wounded Tokomon.\n\nDorumon digivolves into his Champion-level Dorugamon, but Gallantmon arrives, revealing to Omnimon that Project Ark's second phase involves wiping out all Digimon, something which he refuses to participate in. Omnimon and Gallantmon duel, but Gallantmon allows himself to be killed so he can discern the truth, leaving Omnimon confused. Magnamon capture Dorugamon on Yggdrasil's command, revealing Dorumon is an experiment. Data is extracted from Dorugamon, used to create an army of DexDoruGreymon while Dorugamon is dumped in a [[wrecking yard]] where he is found by resistance members Mummymon and Wizardmon. Yggdrasil's horde attacks the group's base, but WarGreymon X and a revived MetalGarurumon X help protect it. Dorugamon awakens, digivolving into DoruGreymon, resembling the attacking horde. Gallantmon returns as an X-Digimon, opening a portal for DoruGreymon to confront Yggdrasil.\n\nDoruGreymon confronts Magnamon and a disillusioned Omnimon. DoruGreymon digivolves into his Mega-level Alphamon, a legendary missing Royal Knight. Alphamon and Omnimon join forces to face Yggdrasil, but the loyal Magnamon warns his master of their arrival. In Yggdrasil's core, the Knights get nowhere with answers, and have to battle Alphamon's counterpart Dexmon.

conference held during the inaugural Russian Grand Prix on the Saturday after the Japanese Grand Prix weekend. Among other things, it was revealed that Bianchi had slowed down at Suzuka's Turn 7 but without disclosing by what margin or the speed of impact, and that the journey to the hospital by ambulance took only an extra 37 minutes relative to the helicopter, without any adverse effects on Bianchi's condition.\n\nFurther, the FIA confirmed ongoing research into closed cockpits for Formula One cars, the possibility of fitting protective skirting to all recovery vehicles as well as ways to slow down cars in crash zones more effectively than double yellow flags. With respect to the latter, the FIA moved to quickly consider the introduction of a [[Safety car#Virtual Safety Car (VSC)|virtual safety car]] \u2013 or VSC system \u2013 which was then tested during the season's final three Grands Prix in the [[2014 United States Grand Prix#Virtual Safety Car (VSC)|United States]], [[2014 Brazilian Grand Prix#Virtual Safety Car (VSC)|Brazil]] and [[2014 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix#Virtual Safety Car (VSC)|Abu Dhabi]] \u2013 based on a Le Mans racing \"[[2014 24 Hours of Le Mans#Circuit and regulation changes|slow zone]]\" arrangement that does not neutralise race proceedings as much as safety car periods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamesallenonf1.com/2014/10/fia-breaks-silence-on-bianchi-accident-considering-new-ways-to-slow-cars-in-crash-zones|title=FIA breaks silence on Bianchi accident \u2013 Considering ways to slow cars in crash zones |date=10 October 2014|work=James Allen on F1}}</ref>\n\nThe following week, the FIA reportedly emailed all teams to request that they retain any information related to Bianchi's Suzuka accident, for exclusive use by an accident panel established by the FIA to investigate Bianchi's accident.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/news/formula-1-fia-asks-teams-suzuka-information-125020680--f1.html|title=Formula 1 \u2013 FIA asks teams for Suzuka information|date=16 October 2014|work=AutoSport|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023143216/https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/news/formula-1-fia-asks-teams-suzuka-information-125020680--f1.html|archivedate=23 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOne week later the FIA announced a review panel to investigate the cause of the accident, which was made up of former drivers and team principals,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/formula1/29696237|title=Jules Bianchi: Ross Brawn included on FIA accident panel|date=20 October 2014|work=BBC Sport}}</ref> and published its findings four weeks later.<ref name=\"Panel\">{{cite news|url=http://www.fia.com/news/accident-panel|title=Accident Panel|work=FIA.com|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile]]|date=3 December 2014|accessdate=6 December 2014}}</ref> The report found that there was no single cause of Bianchi's accident.

Despite this, Marussia was not found to be responsible for the accident.\n\nFor the 2015 season, on safety grounds, the FIA also implemented measures to alter the start time of certain Grands Prix by requiring that it is not less than four hours before either sunset or dusk, except in the case of official night races.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/117397|title=Formula 1 alters grand prix start times after Jules Bianchi crash|work=BBC Sport|date=20 January 2015|accessdate=22 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2015, Peter Wright, the Chairman of the FIA Safety Commission was quoted as saying that a closed cockpit would not have averted Bianchi's head injuries, while the Vice President, Andy Mellow, also confirmed that attaching impact protection to recovery vehicles was not a feasible solution.<ref name=254g/>\n\n===Medical treatment and updates===\nThe first family update following Bianchi's emergency surgery was made by his father in the week beginning 13 October 2014.

conference held during the inaugural Russian Grand Prix on the Saturday after the Japanese Grand Prix weekend. Among other things, it was revealed that Bianchi had slowed down at Suzuka's Turn 7 but without disclosing by what margin or the speed of impact, and that the journey to the hospital by ambulance took only an extra 37 minutes relative to the helicopter, without any adverse effects on Bianchi's condition.\n\nFurther, the FIA confirmed ongoing research into closed cockpits for Formula One cars, the possibility of fitting protective skirting to all recovery vehicles as well as ways to slow down cars in crash zones more effectively than double yellow flags. With respect to the latter, the FIA moved to quickly consider the introduction of a [[Safety car#Virtual Safety Car (VSC)|virtual safety car]] \u2013 or VSC system \u2013 which was then tested during the season's final three Grands Prix in the [[2014 United States Grand Prix#Virtual Safety Car (VSC)|United States]], [[2014 Brazilian Grand Prix#Virtual Safety Car (VSC)|Brazil]] and [[2014 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix#Virtual Safety Car (VSC)|Abu Dhabi]] \u2013 based on a Le Mans racing \"[[2014 24 Hours of Le Mans#Circuit and regulation changes|slow zone]]\" arrangement that does not neutralise race proceedings as much as safety car periods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamesallenonf1.com/2014/10/fia-breaks-silence-on-bianchi-accident-considering-new-ways-to-slow-cars-in-crash-zones|title=FIA breaks silence on Bianchi accident \u2013 Considering ways to slow cars in crash zones |date=10 October 2014|work=James Allen on F1}}</ref>\n\nThe following week, the FIA reportedly emailed all teams to request that they retain any information related to Bianchi's Suzuka accident, for exclusive use by an accident panel established by the FIA to investigate Bianchi's accident.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/news/formula-1-fia-asks-teams-suzuka-information-125020680--f1.html|title=Formula 1 \u2013 FIA asks teams for Suzuka information|date=16 October 2014|work=AutoSport|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023143216/https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/news/formula-1-fia-asks-teams-suzuka-information-125020680--f1.html|archivedate=23 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOne week later the FIA announced a review panel to investigate the cause of the accident, which was made up of former drivers and team principals,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/formula1/29696237|title=Jules Bianchi: Ross Brawn included on FIA accident panel|date=20 October 2014|work=BBC Sport}}</ref> and published its findings four weeks later.<ref name=\"Panel\">{{cite news|url=http://www.fia.com/news/accident-panel|title=Accident Panel|work=FIA.com|publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile]]|date=3 December 2014|accessdate=6 December 2014}}</ref> The report found that there was no single cause of Bianchi's accident.

Despite this, Marussia was not found to be responsible for the accident.\n\nFor the 2015 season, on safety grounds, the FIA also implemented measures to alter the start time of certain Grands Prix by requiring that it is not less than four hours before either sunset or dusk, except in the case of official night races.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/117397|title=Formula 1 alters grand prix start times after Jules Bianchi crash|work=BBC Sport|date=20 January 2015|accessdate=22 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2015, Peter Wright, the Chairman of the FIA Safety Commission was quoted as saying that a closed cockpit would not have averted Bianchi's head injuries, while the Vice President, Andy Mellow, also confirmed that attaching impact protection to recovery vehicles was not a feasible solution.<ref name=254g/>\n\n===Medical treatment and updates===\nThe first family update following Bianchi's emergency surgery was made by his father in the week beginning 13 October 2014.
