The word \"Ghana\" in local Rajasthani means 'dense forest' and as such the National Park is home to over 230 species of Birds both resident and migratory, excluding certain vagrant species. It is also a major tourist centre with scores of [[ornithologist]]s arriving here in the hibernal season. It was declared a protected sanctuary in 1971. It is also a [[World Heritage Site]].<ref name=\"heritage site\">[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/340/ World Heritage Site], UNESCO World Heritage Status.</ref>\n\nKeoladeo Ghana National Park is a man-made and man-managed wetland and one of the [[national parks of India]]. The reserve protects  Bharatpur from frequent floods, provides grazing grounds for village cattle, and earlier was primarily used as a [[waterfowl hunting]] ground. The {{convert|29|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} reserve is locally known as Ghana, and is a mosaic of dry grasslands, woodlands, woodland swamps and wetlands. These diverse habitats are home to 366 bird species, 379 floral species, 50 species of fish, 13 species of snakes, 5 species of lizards, 7 amphibian species, 7 turtle species and a variety of other invertebrates.<ref name=\"PC Report\">[http://www.planningcommission.gov.in/reports/E_F/Bharatpur.pdf Planning Commission Report] A report filed with Planning Commission of India.</ref> Every year thousands of migratory waterfowl visit the park for wintering and breeding. The sanctuary is one of the richest bird areas in the world and is known for nesting of resident birds and visiting migratory birds including water birds. The rare Siberian cranes used to winter in this park but this central population is now extinct. According to founder of the World Wildlife Fund [[Sir Peter Scott|Peter Scott]], Keoladeo National Park is one of the world\u2019s best bird areas.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n[[File:Painted stork.JPG|thumb|left|[[Painted stork]] at Keoladeo National Park]]\nThe sanctuary was created 250&nbsp;years ago and is named after a Keoladeo (Shiva) temple within its boundaries. Initially, it was a natural depression; and was flooded after the ''Ajan Bund'' was constructed by [[Maharaja Suraj Mal]], then the ruler of the princely state of [[Bharatpur, India|Bharatpur]], between 1726\u20131763. The [[Bunding|bund]] was created at the confluence of two rivers, the [[Gambhir]] and [[Banganga]]. The park was a hunting ground for the Maharajas of Bharatpur, a tradition dating back to 1850, and duck shoots were organised yearly in honour of the [[Viceroy of India|British viceroys]]. In one shoot alone in 1938, over 4,273 birds such as [[mallard]]s and [[teal]]s were killed by [[Victor Hope, 2nd Marquess of Linlithgow|Lord Linlithgow]], then [[Viceroy of India]].{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nThe park was established as a national park on 10 March 1982. Previously the private duck shooting preserve of the Maharaja of Bharatpur since the 1850s, the area was designated as a bird sanctuary on 13 March 1976 and a [[Ramsar Site|Ramsar site]] under the Wetland Convention in October 1981.<ref name=\"Ramsar Site\">[http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-documents-list/main/ramsar/1-31-218_4000_0__ Ramsar Convention Listed Sites] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409081737/http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-documents-list/main/ramsar/1-31-218_4000_0__ |date= 9 April 2013 }}, List of Site.</ref> \n\nThe last big shoot was held in 1964 but the Maharajah retained shooting rights until 1972. In 1985, the Park was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] under the World Heritage Convention. It is a reserve forest under the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953 and therefore, is the property of the State of Rajasthan of the Indian Union. In 1982, grazing was banned in the park, leading to violent clashes between local farmers and the government.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Great Egret at Keoladeo Ghana National Park, Bharatpur, India.jpg|thumb|right|[[Great egret]] at Keoladeo Ghana National Park, Bharatpur, India]]\n[[File:Eurasian spoonbill.JPG|thumb|Eurasian spoonbill]]\n[[File:Knob-billed Duck, Bharatpur.jpg|thumb|[[Knob-billed duck]] alongside [[Eurasian coot]]]]\n\nKeoladeo (Bharatpur) National Park (27\u00b010'N, 77\u00b031'E) is a World Heritage Site situated in eastern [[Rajasthan]]. The park is 2 kilometers (km) south-east of Bharatpur and 55&nbsp;km west of Agra. The Park is spread over approx 29 square kilometer area. One third of the Keoladeo National Park habitat is wetland systems with varying types of microhabitats having trees, mounds, dykes and open water with or without submerged or emergent plants. The uplands have grasslands (savannas) of tall species of grass together with scattered trees and shrubs present in varying density.<ref name=\"Ramsar Site\"/>\n\nA similar habitat with short grasses, such as'' [[Cynodon dactylon]]'' and ''[[Dichanthium annulatum]]'' also exists. Woodlands with thickets of huge Kadam trees (''[[Neolamarckia cadamba]]'') are distributed in scattered pockets. Richness and diversity of plant life inside the Park is remarkable. The Park\u2019s flora consists of 379 species of flowering plants of which 96 are wetland species. The Wetland is a part of the Indo-Gangetic Great Plains.<ref name=\"Ramsar Site\"/>\n\nIn an area characterized by sparse vegetation, the park is the only spot which has dense vegetation and trees. The principal vegetation types are tropical dry deciduous forests intermixed with dry grasslands. Where the forest has degraded, the greater part of the area is covered with shrubs and medium-sized trees. The park is a freshwater swamp and is flooded during the monsoon. The rest of the area remains dry.<ref name=\"Ramsar Site\"/>\nWater remains only in some depressions. This alternate wetting and drying helps to maintain the ecology of the freshwater swamp, ideal for water-fowl and resident water birds. Arrangement to pump water from deep tube wells to fill small depressions to save seeds, spores and other aquatic life also exist. They are also helpful in extreme years of drought.<ref name=\"Ramsar Site2\">[http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-pubs-annolist-annotated-ramsar-16561/main/ramsar/1-30-168%5E16561_4000_0__ Site Description], Ramsar Site no. 230.</ref>\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Family Breakfast.jpg|thumb|Group of painted storks in one of the wetland habitation in Keoladeo National Park, located in Bharatpur district of Rajasthan, India]]\nDuring 1988, mean maximum temperature ranged from 20.9\u00b0 Celsius (C) in January to 47.8&nbsp;\u00b0C in May, while the mean temperature varied from 6.8&nbsp;\u00b0C in December to 26.5&nbsp;\u00b0C in June. The diurnal temperature variation ranged from 5&nbsp;\u00b0C in January to 50&nbsp;\u00b0C in May. Mean relatively humidity varied from 62% in March to 83.3% in December. The mean annual precipitation is 662 millimeters (mm), with rain falling on an average of 36 days per year. During 1988 only 395mm of rain fell during 32 wet days.<ref name=\"Fieldwork\"/>\n\nLocal observers have noted the shrinking of habitat for aquatic plant species in the Keoladeo National Park in Bharatpur, Rajasthan, northern India, after a number of years of drought and upstream water abstraction. The Keoladeo Naturalists Society invited U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) research ecologist Beth Middleton to visit the park to make observations of aquatic species of concern (Technical Assistance Agreement T-09-763b). The Keoladeo Naturalists Society (a.k.a. \"The Barefoot Naturalists\") is a group of local nature guides and rickshaw pullers. Middleton is a researcher who studies the impact of climate change, drought, and hurricanes on coastal wetlands; because of this expertise, she was asked to look at the impact of droughts on the Keoladeo National Park wetlands. Middleton did her Ph.D. research in India 20 years previously, so she was familiar with the park under conditions of more normal flooding. Upon her return in April 2009, the park looked very different after several years of drought. The aquatic areas of the park appeared to be smaller than during the 1980s; however, at least one positive observation is that park managers have enlisted local villagers to remove the invasive mesquite plant, ''[[Prosopis juliflora]]'', within upland savanna habitats.<ref name=\"Fieldwork\">[http://soundwaves.usgs.gov/2009/08/fieldwork3.html Shrinking Biodiversity], Impact of Falling monsoon in Keoladeo National park.</ref>\n\n==Biology==\n\n===Flora===\nA semi-arid biotype, the park is the only area with significant vegetation, hence the term 'Ghana' meaning 'thicket'. The principal vegetation types are tropical dry deciduous forest, intermixed with dry grassland in areas where forest has been degraded. Apart from the artificially managed marshes; much of the area is covered by medium-sized trees and shrubs.\n\n[[Forest]]s, mostly in the north-east of the park, are dominated by kalam or kadam (''[[Mitragyna parvifolia]]''), jamun (''[[Syzygium cumini]]'') and babul (''[[Acacia nilotica]]''). The open woodland is mostly babul with a small amount of kandi (''[[Prosopis cineraria]]'') and ber (''[[Zizyphus]]'').\n\n[[Scrubland]]s are dominated by ber and kair. It is unlikely that the site would support such numbers of waterfowl as it does without the addition of water from Ajan Bund, a man-made impoundment. Soils are predominantly alluvial \u2013 some clay has formed as a result of the periodic inundations. The mean annual precipitation is 662mm, with rain falling on an average of 36 days per year.\n\nThe open [[woodland]] is mostly babul with a small amount of kandi and ber. Scrublands are dominated by ber and kair (''[[Capparis decidua]]'').<ref name=\"Fauna\">[http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2009/5193/pdf/SIR2009-5193.pdf Vegetation in Keoladeo National Park].</ref>\n\nPiloo (''[[Salvadora oleoides]]'' and ''[[Salvadora persica]]'') also present in the park and happens to be virtually the only woody plants found in areas of saline soil.

They are food for many fish and birds, as well as some animal species, and hence, constitute a major link in the food chain and functioning of the ecosystem. Land insects are in abundance and have a positive effect on the breeding of land birds.\n\nKeoladeo National Park is known as a \u201cbird paradise\u201d, since more than 370 bird species have been recorded in the park. Ornithologically, the park assumes significance in two respects: One because of its strategic location as a staging ground for [[migratory waterfowl]] arriving in the Indian subcontinent before dispersing to various regions. Further waterfowl converge here before departing to breeding grounds in the western [[Palearctic]] region. In addition, the wetland is a wintering area for massive congregations of waterfowl. It is also the only regular wintering area in India for the [[critically endangered]] [[Siberian crane]].<ref name=\"Biology\" />\n\n====Birds====\n[[File:Darter at Sunset.JPG|thumb|Darter at sunset]]\n[[File:Indian Saras crane01.JPG|thumb|Indian Saurus crane]]\n[[File:Oriental magpie-robin in Bharatpur National Park.jpg|thumb|[[Oriental magpie-robin]] in Keoladeo National Park]]\nThe park's location in the [[Gangetic Plain]] makes it an unrivalled breeding site for [[heron]]s, [[stork]]s and [[cormorant]]s, and an important wintering ground for large numbers of migrant [[duck]]s. The most common waterfowl are [[gadwall]], [[shoveler]], [[common teal]], [[cotton teal]], [[tufted duck]], [[knob-billed duck]], [[little cormorant]], [[great cormorant]], [[Indian shag]], [[ruff]], [[painted stork]], [[white spoonbill]], [[Asian open-billed stork]], [[oriental ibis]], [[darter]], [[common sandpiper]], [[wood sandpiper]] and [[green sandpiper]]. The [[sarus crane]], with its spectacular courtship dance, is also found here.<ref name=\"Biology\" />\n\nBirds present include [[warblers]], [[Old World babbler|babbler]]s, [[bee-eater]]s, [[bulbul]]s, [[bunting (bird)|bunting]]s, [[chat (bird)|chats]], [[Painted francolin]]s and [[quail]]s, [[Indian grey hornbill]] and [[Marshall's iora]]. Raptors include [[osprey]], [[peregrine falcon]], [[Pallas' sea eagle]], [[short-toed eagle]], [[tawny eagle]], [[imperial eagle]], [[spotted eagle]] and [[crested serpent eagle]]. The [[greater spotted eagle]] has recently been recorded breeding here, a new breeding record for the species in India.<ref name=\"Biology\" />\n\n====Mammals====\n[[File:Sambhars are common sight at Keoladeo Ghana National Park Bharatpur India.jpg|thumb|[[Sambar (deer)|Sambar]] are a common sight at Keoladeo Ghana National Park.]]\n[[File:Neel gai 02.jpg|thumb|A nilgai inside Keoladeo National Park]]\nMammalian fauna of Keoladeo National Park is equally rich with 27 identified species.<ref name=\"Biology\" /> [[Nilgai]], feral [[cattle]], and [[chital deer]] are common while [[Sambar (deer)|sambar]] are few. [[Wild boar]] and [[Indian porcupine]] are often spotted sneaking out of the Park to raid crop fields. Two [[mongoose]] species, the [[small Indian mongoose]] and the common [[Indian gray mongoose]], are occasionally found. [[Felidae|Cat]] species present include the [[jungle cat]] and the [[fishing cat]]. The [[Asian palm civet]] and the [[small Indian civet]] are also present, but rarely sighted. The [[smooth-coated otter]] can be seen attacking birds such as [[coot]]s and at times crossing the woodlands. [[Golden Jackal]]s and [[Striped hyena]]s are also sighted and have taken up the role of predators and feed on birds and rodents. Many species of [[rat]]s, [[mice]], [[gerbil]]s and [[bat]]s are also found in the park.<ref name=\"PC Report\" />\nPrimates include the [[rhesus macaque]] and [[Hanuman langur]]s. Large predators are absent, [[leopard]]s having been deliberately exterminated by 1964, but small carnivores include [[Bengal fox]], jackal, [[striped hyena]], [[Paradoxurus hermaphroditus|common palm civet]], [[small Indian civet]], Indian grey mongoose (''[[Herpestes edwardsi]]''), [[fishing cat]], [[leopard cat]], [[jungle cat]] and [[smooth-coated otter]]. Ungulates include [[blackbuck]], [[chital]], [[Sambar (deer)|sambar]], [[hog deer]], [[nilgai]] and [[wild boar]] and feral cattle.<ref name=\"Biology\" />\n\n====Other species====\nFish fauna of the park comprises 43 species, of which 37 enter the park along with the water from Ajan Bund, and six species are breeding residents. During a good rainy season the park receives around 65 million fish fry and fingerlings. The fish population and diversity are of high ecological importance as they form the food source of many birds.\n\nThe [[herpetofauna]] of Keoladeo National Park is diverse. Out of the ten species of turtles that are seen in Rajasthan, seven are present in this park. Besides this, there are five lizard species, thirteen snake species and seven species of amphibians.  The [[Hoplobatrachus crassus|bullfrog]] and [[skipper frog]] are commonly found in the wetlands.  It is often easy to see a [[Pythonidae|python]] out of its burrow and basking in the sun on a sunny winter day.  The common [[monitor lizard]], [[Indian porcupine]] and [[Hipposideros bicolor|bi-colored leaf-nose bat]] have been seen in the same burrow as that of the python. The venomous snakes found in the park are [[krait]], [[cobra]] and [[Russell\u2019s viper]].<ref name=\"Biology\" />\n\n==World Heritage Site==\n[[File:Eurasian spoonbill01.jpg|thumb|Eurasian spoonbill]]\nTo be included on the World Heritage List, sites must be of outstanding universal value and meet at least one out of ten selection criteria. These criteria are explained in the Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention which, besides the text of the Convention, is the main working tool on World Heritage. The criteria are regularly revised by the Committee to reflect the evolution of the World Heritage concept itself.  The UNESCO convention for listing goes on to explain the criteria the selection of Keoladeo Ghana National Park as a '''World Heritage Site under the Natural Criteria iv of Operational Guidelines 2002''' and the description which follows is that the park is a \u201cHabitat of rare and endangered species. The park is a wetland of international importance for migratory waterfowl. It is the wintering ground for the rare Siberian crane and habitat for large numbers of resident nesting birds.\u201d According to the revised '''Operational Guidelines of 2005''', the park falls under '''Criteria (x)''' which states that to be conferred the status of World Heritage, the site should \u201ccontain the most important and significant natural habitats for in-site conservation of biological diversity, including those containing threatened species of outstanding universal value from the point of view of science or conservation.\u201d<ref name=\"heritage site\" />\n\n==Management==\n\n===Issues===\nThe management objective is to allow the area to flood and dry out annually, rather than be maintained as a system of permanent marshes. Water for the wetlands is supplied from the dam outside the park boundaries. Usually, some 14.17 million cubic meters of water is the estimated annual requirement of the park. The water level inside the park is regulated by means of dykes and artificial embankments. The alternative arrangement of water in case of emergencies such as danger of marshes and water bodies drying out completely is ensured through four boreholes so that survival of the aquatic flora and fauna is not endangered before the arrival of monsoon. The boundaries of the park are clearly delineated by a thirty-two Kilometer long boundary encircling the park restricting the encroachment of humans and domestic cattle inside the perimeters of the park. The road from Bharatpur town which used to intersect the park was also closed and relocated outside the boundary to reduce the disturbance by visitors from the town which helped in bringing down the levels of pollution inside the park considerably. As opposed to most of the national parks in India and elsewhere, Bharatpur Bird sanctuary has no buffer zone. Due to the heavy density of population and more than 15 villages settled on the periphery of park, it was impossible for authorities to create a buffer zone around the bird sanctuary. Grazing and collection of firewood and grass was phased out from the park as far back as 1983.\n\n===Constraints===\nThe [[Siberian crane]], which formerly lived throughout the entire Indo-Gangetic plains of India, is reported to be no longer found in the area. Its absence has been attributed to hunting by nomadic tribes along the species' 5,000 mile migration route from Siberia to Bharatpur.\n\nSome 2,500 cattle and domestic [[water buffalo]] were allowed in the area up until November 1982 when grazing was banned. Predictably, the ban led to a buildup of local resentment, resulting in an attempted forced entry into the park. Police opened fire and eight people were killed: tensions still remain high.<ref>Lewis, M. 2003. ''Cattle and Conservation at Bharatpur: A case study in science and advocacy''. Conservation and Society 1: 1\u201321.</ref> The absence of grazing is causing management problems as vegetation, principally Paspalum distichum, a perennial amphibious grass, blocks up the channels. The Rajasthan government has rejected a proposal from the Bombay Natural History Society to allow limited grazing, since this would conflict with the law. Furthermore, recycled nutrients from the large quantity of dung deposited by livestock probably supported considerable numbers of insects.<ref name=\"PC Report\" />\n\nThe presence of some 700 feral cattle within the park is cause for concern as they compete with wildlife for valuable forage. [[Larva]]e of the [[Lepidoptera]]n ''[[Parapoynx diminutalis]]'' has also been a serious pest, and considerably inhibited the growth of ''[[Nymphoides cristatum]]'' during June\u2013July 1986. High levels of pollutants in Ajan Bund are believed to be responsible for the increasing number of piscivorous birds seen in a dazed state and unable to fly. Fewer birds were recorded in 1984 than in previous years. Four [[sarus crane]]s and 40 [[ring-necked dove]]s were found dead outside the park during 1988 and early 1989, possibly due to [[pesticide poisoning]], and a study of the impact of pesticide use in surrounding areas on the park has been initiated in addition to studies on heavy metal contamination. Disturbance from visitors can be a cause for concern, especially during December and January when visitors come to see the cranes.<ref name=\"research facilities\" />\n\nA non-native water hyacinth Icornia species was introduced in 1961, and has now proliferated to the extent that it is blocking the artificial waterways and filling the impoundments. This is significantly altering the habitat for many bird species, and is a serious management problem. Attempts to control the species have been ineffectual to date.\n\n==Tourism and visitor facilities==\nBy virtue of being one of the best bird watching sites of Asia, more than 100,000 visitors come to the park every year. The range of visitors varies from very serious birdwatchers to school children. Of the visitors, 45,000 are foreign tourists. In addition, the location of the park is such that tourists visiting Agra, Fatehpur Sikri and Jaipur invariably stop over at Bharatpur. The park opens from sunrise to sunset around the year. Food and accommodation facilities are available within the precincts of the park. The only accommodation inside the Keoladeo National Park is available in the property of government Bharatpur Ashoka Forest Lodge and lesser expensive Shanti Kutir, which is maintained and run by the ITDC. Bharatpur Forest Lodge is a quaint hotel in the vicinity of natural treasure trove of the park and has a total of 16 rooms to offer to visitors. Its circuit house and [[dak bungalow]] also offer good accommodation options.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Visitors coming to Bharatpur can also stay in palaces, havelis and other heritage properties converted into hotels. It is always advisable to have one\u2019s accommodation pre-booked, especially so during winters. An array of 3 star hotels and resorts are also located in the vicinity of the park where visitors can stay cozily.<ref name=\"Tourism\">[http://rajasthanwildlife.rajasthan.gov.in/wild-life/KeoladeoGhanaNationalPark.htm Tourism in Keoladeo National Park] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215101142/http://www.rajasthanwildlife.rajasthan.gov.in/wild-life/KeoladeoGhanaNationalPark.htm |date=15 February 2011 }}, Visitor facilities in Park.</ref>Besides the normal tourism activities and self-arranged bird watching tours of the Keoladeo National Park, visitors can also opt for a tour of this birding destination by selecting from an array of luxury tourist train services.

The society has recently intensified its operations and has established a hydro-biological station to monitor the ecology of the wetland. Particular attention will be given to any in dramatic change in the vegetation following the ban on grazing. Limnological studies have been carried out by the Zoology Department of the University of Rajasthan, Jaipur. The park authorities are monitoring the bird populations. A documentary film 'Indian birds of the monsoon' was produced by S. and B. Breeden in 1979\u20131980. The park has considerable potential for education, more so than other wetland sites in India, in view of it being relatively near to the cities of Agra, Delhi and Jaipur.\n\nBetween December 1992 and January 1995, a collaborative project between the Governments of India and Russia, International Crane Foundation and Wild Bird Society of Japan was set up to save the Siberian crane. The project focused on releasing captivity bred cranes into the wild, tracking migratory routes of common cranes, and building up the resident crane population in the park. Although the project did not yield the desired results, the successful survival of introduced cranes in the park has given sufficient hope to develop a viable resident population in the future.<ref name=\"research facilities\">[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Keoladeo_(Bharatpur)_National_Park,_India#gen6 Research and Field study initiatives], Scientific research at Keoladeo.</ref>\n\n==Crises of 2007==\n\nA proposal for water supply to Keoladeo National Park, Bharatpur was forwarded by the Government of Rajasthan seeking assistance from Planning Commission as advised and approved by the Ministry of Environment and Forests. Keeping in view the uniqueness of the ecosystem and the capacity to attract a variety of migratory birds the project was thought to be approved in principal with the caveat that the cost be firmed up after a visit to the site by an expert team. The park is in danger of being removed as a Ramsar Site as well as UNESCO World Heritage Site, due to severe drought and abandoning of the park midway by nesting birds in the year 2007.<ref name=\"Drought\">[http://www.thebagh.com/Bharatpur%20Springs%20back%20to%20life.pdf Link text], Drought at Keoladeo National Park.</ref>\n\nA proposal for water supply to Keoladeo National Park, Bharatpur was forwarded by the Government of Rajasthan seeking assistance from Planning Commission as advised and approved by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) vide their letter dated 10.04.2008.  As per the MoEF, the proposal is beyond the purview of the existing centrally sponsored scheme of the MoEF, seems to be viable and has the potential to put an end to the eternal [[water scarcity in India|water scarcity]] in Bharatpur National Park.\n\nThe Keoladeo National Park (KNP) is a Ramsar Wetland Site and a [[World Heritage site]].  Due to acute water scarcity, the ecosystem of the Park has been affected badly and this has resulted in reduction in the arrival of migratory birds in the National Park. Water supply is essential for the National Park, which is a wetland and a Ramsar site facing acute shortage of water for the last few years.  Currently, apart from rainfall the Park receives water from \u201cAjan Bund\u201d, a temporary reservoir via the Dakan canal.  Through a small canal dug last year water from Khokhar Weir (Bees Mora) is also available. The total requirement of water for the Park is estimated at about 14.17 million cubic meters (500 MCft).  The supply from Ajan Bund is irregular and subject to the bund being full to the extent of reservoir level at 8.5 meters. During the last several years either water is not supplied or supplied insufficiently.<ref name=\"PC Report\" />\n\nThe project had been prepared to keep in view the need for 400 MCFT of water during late July to August, for a period of 30 days to the Park which is to be had by diverting and lifting flood waters of Yamuna.  The project thus covered diversion of water during monsoon through underground pipes with lifting arrangements over a length of 16&nbsp;km from the off-take point of Goverdhan drain near Santruk village.  The estimated cost of the project as proposed by the State Government was to the tune of Rs. 650 million. The project proposed was to channelize water from Govardhan drain to meet the water deficit of KNP during the months of July to September at the time of requirement.  The major components of the project were construction of a head regulator with control gate at the drain located in the state, raw water reservoir with capacity of 13,000 m, 3 pump houses, DG sets for pumping station and laying and testing of /PCC/MS pipelines.<ref name=\"PC Report\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Arid Forest Research Institute]] (AFRI)\n* [[Kanwar Lake Bird Sanctuary|Kanwar Taal Bird Sanctuary]]\n* [[Sultanpur National Park|Sultanpur Bird Sanctuary]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Keoladeo National Park}}\n*{{webarchive |url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20021009114606/http%3A//www.wcmc.org.uk/protected_areas/data/wh/keoladeo.html |title=WCMC |date=2002-10-09}}\n*Reuters: [https://web.archive.org/web/20071223122111/http://today.reuters.com/News/CrisesArticle.aspx?storyId=DEL95384 Drought-ridden Indian bird park loses its birds].

Over 230 species of birds are known to be resident. It is also a major tourist centre with scores of [[ornithologist]]s arriving here in the hibernal season. It was declared a protected sanctuary in 1971. It is also a [[World Heritage Site]].<ref name=\"heritage site\">[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/340/ World Heritage Site], UNESCO World Heritage Status.</ref>\n\nKeoladeo Ghana National Park is a man-made and man-managed wetland and one of the [[national parks of India]]. The reserve protects  Bharatpur from frequent floods, provides grazing grounds for village cattle, and earlier was primarily used as a [[waterfowl hunting]] ground. The {{convert|29|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} reserve is locally known as Ghana, and is a mosaic of dry grasslands, woodlands, woodland swamps and wetlands. These diverse habitats are home to 366 bird species, 379 floral species, 50 species of fish, 13 species of snakes, 5 species of lizards, 7 amphibian species, 7 turtle species and a variety of other invertebrates.<ref name=\"PC Report\">[http://www.planningcommission.gov.in/reports/E_F/Bharatpur.pdf Planning Commission Report] A report filed with Planning Commission of India.</ref> Every year thousands of migratory waterfowl visit the park for wintering and breeding. The sanctuary is one of the richest bird areas in the world and is known for nesting of resident birds and visiting migratory birds including water birds. The rare Siberian cranes used to winter in this park but this central population is now extinct. According to founder of the World Wildlife Fund [[Sir Peter Scott|Peter Scott]], Keoladeo National Park is one of the world\u2019s best bird areas.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n[[File:Painted stork.JPG|thumb|left|[[Painted stork]] at Keoladeo National Park]]\nThe sanctuary was created 250&nbsp;years ago and is named after a Keoladeo (Shiva) temple within its boundaries. Initially, it was a natural depression; and was flooded after the ''Ajan Bund'' was constructed by [[Maharaja Suraj Mal]], then the ruler of the princely state of [[Bharatpur, India|Bharatpur]], between 1726\u20131763. The [[Bunding|bund]] was created at the confluence of two rivers, the [[Gambhir]] and [[Banganga]]. The park was a hunting ground for the Maharajas of Bharatpur, a tradition dating back to 1850, and duck shoots were organised yearly in honour of the [[Viceroy of India|British viceroys]]. In one shoot alone in 1938, over 4,273 birds such as [[mallard]]s and [[teal]]s were killed by [[Victor Hope, 2nd Marquess of Linlithgow|Lord Linlithgow]], then [[Viceroy of India]].{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nThe park was established as a national park on 10 March 1982. Previously the private duck shooting preserve of the Maharaja of Bharatpur since the 1850s, the area was designated as a bird sanctuary on 13 March 1976 and a [[Ramsar Site|Ramsar site]] under the Wetland Convention in October 1981.<ref name=\"Ramsar Site\">[http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-documents-list/main/ramsar/1-31-218_4000_0__ Ramsar Convention Listed Sites] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409081737/http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-documents-list/main/ramsar/1-31-218_4000_0__ |date= 9 April 2013 }}, List of Site.</ref> \n\nThe last big shoot was held in 1964 but the Maharajah retained shooting rights until 1972. In 1985, the Park was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] under the World Heritage Convention. It is a reserve forest under the Rajasthan Forest Act, 1953 and therefore, is the property of the State of Rajasthan of the Indian Union. In 1982, grazing was banned in the park, leading to violent clashes between local farmers and the government.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Great Egret at Keoladeo Ghana National Park, Bharatpur, India.jpg|thumb|right|[[Great egret]] at Keoladeo Ghana National Park, Bharatpur, India]]\n[[File:Eurasian spoonbill.JPG|thumb|Eurasian spoonbill]]\n[[File:Knob-billed Duck, Bharatpur.jpg|thumb|[[Knob-billed duck]] alongside [[Eurasian coot]]]]\n\nKeoladeo (Bharatpur) National Park (27\u00b010'N, 77\u00b031'E) is a World Heritage Site situated in eastern [[Rajasthan]]. The park is 2 kilometers (km) south-east of Bharatpur and 55&nbsp;km west of Agra. The Park is spread over approx 29 square kilometer area. One third of the Keoladeo National Park habitat is wetland systems with varying types of microhabitats having trees, mounds, dykes and open water with or without submerged or emergent plants. The uplands have grasslands (savannas) of tall species of grass together with scattered trees and shrubs present in varying density.<ref name=\"Ramsar Site\"/>\n\nA similar habitat with short grasses, such as'' [[Cynodon dactylon]]'' and ''[[Dichanthium annulatum]]'' also exists. Woodlands with thickets of huge Kadam trees (''[[Neolamarckia cadamba]]'') are distributed in scattered pockets. Richness and diversity of plant life inside the Park is remarkable. The Park\u2019s flora consists of 379 species of flowering plants of which 96 are wetland species. The Wetland is a part of the Indo-Gangetic Great Plains.<ref name=\"Ramsar Site\"/>\n\nIn an area characterized by sparse vegetation, the park is the only spot which has dense vegetation and trees. The principal vegetation types are tropical dry deciduous forests intermixed with dry grasslands. Where the forest has degraded, the greater part of the area is covered with shrubs and medium-sized trees. The park is a freshwater swamp and is flooded during the monsoon. The rest of the area remains dry.<ref name=\"Ramsar Site\"/>\nWater remains only in some depressions. This alternate wetting and drying helps to maintain the ecology of the freshwater swamp, ideal for water-fowl and resident water birds. Arrangement to pump water from deep tube wells to fill small depressions to save seeds, spores and other aquatic life also exist. They are also helpful in extreme years of drought.<ref name=\"Ramsar Site2\">[http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-pubs-annolist-annotated-ramsar-16561/main/ramsar/1-30-168%5E16561_4000_0__ Site Description], Ramsar Site no. 230.</ref>\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Family Breakfast.jpg|thumb|Group of painted storks in one of the wetland habitation in Keoladeo National Park, located in Bharatpur district of Rajasthan, India]]\nDuring 1988, mean maximum temperature ranged from 20.9\u00b0 Celsius (C) in January to 47.8&nbsp;\u00b0C in May, while the mean temperature varied from 6.8&nbsp;\u00b0C in December to 26.5&nbsp;\u00b0C in June. The diurnal temperature variation ranged from 5&nbsp;\u00b0C in January to 50&nbsp;\u00b0C in May. Mean relatively humidity varied from 62% in March to 83.3% in December. The mean annual precipitation is 662 millimeters (mm), with rain falling on an average of 36 days per year. During 1988 only 395mm of rain fell during 32 wet days.<ref name=\"Fieldwork\"/>\n\nLocal observers have noted the shrinking of habitat for aquatic plant species in the Keoladeo National Park in Bharatpur, Rajasthan, northern India, after a number of years of drought and upstream water abstraction. The Keoladeo Naturalists Society invited U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) research ecologist Beth Middleton to visit the park to make observations of aquatic species of concern (Technical Assistance Agreement T-09-763b). The Keoladeo Naturalists Society (a.k.a. \"The Barefoot Naturalists\") is a group of local nature guides and rickshaw pullers. Middleton is a researcher who studies the impact of climate change, drought, and hurricanes on coastal wetlands; because of this expertise, she was asked to look at the impact of droughts on the Keoladeo National Park wetlands. Middleton did her Ph.D. research in India 20 years previously, so she was familiar with the park under conditions of more normal flooding. Upon her return in April 2009, the park looked very different after several years of drought. The aquatic areas of the park appeared to be smaller than during the 1980s; however, at least one positive observation is that park managers have enlisted local villagers to remove the invasive mesquite plant, ''[[Prosopis juliflora]]'', within upland savanna habitats.<ref name=\"Fieldwork\">[http://soundwaves.usgs.gov/2009/08/fieldwork3.html Shrinking Biodiversity], Impact of Falling monsoon in Keoladeo National park.</ref>\n\n==Biology==\n\n===Flora===\nA semi-arid biotype, the park is the only area with significant vegetation, hence the term 'Ghana' meaning 'thicket'. The principal vegetation types are tropical dry deciduous forest, intermixed with dry grassland in areas where forest has been degraded. Apart from the artificially managed marshes; much of the area is covered by medium-sized trees and shrubs.\n\n[[Forest]]s, mostly in the north-east of the park, are dominated by kalam or kadam (''[[Mitragyna parvifolia]]''), jamun (''[[Syzygium cumini]]'') and babul (''[[Acacia nilotica]]''). The open woodland is mostly babul with a small amount of kandi (''[[Prosopis cineraria]]'') and ber (''[[Zizyphus]]'').\n\n[[Scrubland]]s are dominated by ber and kair. It is unlikely that the site would support such numbers of waterfowl as it does without the addition of water from Ajan Bund, a man-made impoundment. Soils are predominantly alluvial \u2013 some clay has formed as a result of the periodic inundations. The mean annual precipitation is 662mm, with rain falling on an average of 36 days per year.\n\nThe open [[woodland]] is mostly babul with a small amount of kandi and ber. Scrublands are dominated by ber and kair (''[[Capparis decidua]]'').<ref name=\"Fauna\">[http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2009/5193/pdf/SIR2009-5193.pdf Vegetation in Keoladeo National Park].</ref>\n\nPiloo (''[[Salvadora oleoides]]'' and ''[[Salvadora persica]]'') also present in the park and happens to be virtually the only woody plants found in areas of saline soil.

They are food for many fish and birds, as well as some animal species, and hence, constitute a major link in the food chain and functioning of the ecosystem. Land insects are in abundance and have a positive effect on the breeding of land birds.\n\nKeoladeo National Park is known as a \u201cbird paradise\u201d, since more than 370 bird species have been recorded in the park. Ornithologically, the park assumes significance in two respects: One because of its strategic location as a staging ground for [[migratory waterfowl]] arriving in the Indian subcontinent before dispersing to various regions. Further waterfowl converge here before departing to breeding grounds in the western [[Palearctic]] region. In addition, the wetland is a wintering area for massive congregations of waterfowl. It is also the only regular wintering area in India for the [[critically endangered]] [[Siberian crane]].<ref name=\"Biology\" />\n\n====Birds====\n[[File:Darter at Sunset.JPG|thumb|Darter at sunset]]\n[[File:Indian Saras crane01.JPG|thumb|Indian Saurus crane]]\n[[File:Oriental magpie-robin in Bharatpur National Park.jpg|thumb|[[Oriental magpie-robin]] in Keoladeo National Park]]\nThe park's location in the [[Gangetic Plain]] makes it an unrivalled breeding site for [[heron]]s, [[stork]]s and [[cormorant]]s, and an important wintering ground for large numbers of migrant [[duck]]s. The most common waterfowl are [[gadwall]], [[shoveler]], [[common teal]], [[cotton teal]], [[tufted duck]], [[knob-billed duck]], [[little cormorant]], [[great cormorant]], [[Indian shag]], [[ruff]], [[painted stork]], [[white spoonbill]], [[Asian open-billed stork]], [[oriental ibis]], [[darter]], [[common sandpiper]], [[wood sandpiper]] and [[green sandpiper]]. The [[sarus crane]], with its spectacular courtship dance, is also found here.<ref name=\"Biology\" />\n\nBirds present include [[warblers]], [[Old World babbler|babbler]]s, [[bee-eater]]s, [[bulbul]]s, [[bunting (bird)|bunting]]s, [[chat (bird)|chats]], [[Painted francolin]]s and [[quail]]s, [[Indian grey hornbill]] and [[Marshall's iora]]. Raptors include [[osprey]], [[peregrine falcon]], [[Pallas' sea eagle]], [[short-toed eagle]], [[tawny eagle]], [[imperial eagle]], [[spotted eagle]] and [[crested serpent eagle]]. The [[greater spotted eagle]] has recently been recorded breeding here, a new breeding record for the species in India.<ref name=\"Biology\" />\n\n====Mammals====\n[[File:Sambhars are common sight at Keoladeo Ghana National Park Bharatpur India.jpg|thumb|[[Sambar (deer)|Sambar]] are a common sight at Keoladeo Ghana National Park.]]\n[[File:Neel gai 02.jpg|thumb|A nilgai inside Keoladeo National Park]]\nMammalian fauna of Keoladeo National Park is equally rich with 27 identified species.<ref name=\"Biology\" /> [[Nilgai]], feral [[cattle]], and [[chital deer]] are common while [[Sambar (deer)|sambar]] are few. [[Wild boar]] and [[Indian porcupine]] are often spotted sneaking out of the Park to raid crop fields. Two [[mongoose]] species, the [[small Indian mongoose]] and the common [[Indian gray mongoose]], are occasionally found. [[Felidae|Cat]] species present include the [[jungle cat]] and the [[fishing cat]]. The [[Asian palm civet]] and the [[small Indian civet]] are also present, but rarely sighted. The [[smooth-coated otter]] can be seen attacking birds such as [[coot]]s and at times crossing the woodlands. [[Golden Jackal]]s and [[Striped hyena]]s are also sighted and have taken up the role of predators and feed on birds and rodents. Many species of [[rat]]s, [[mice]], [[gerbil]]s and [[bat]]s are also found in the park.<ref name=\"PC Report\" />\nPrimates include the [[rhesus macaque]] and [[Hanuman langur]]s. Large predators are absent, [[leopard]]s having been deliberately exterminated by 1964, but small carnivores include [[Bengal fox]], jackal, [[striped hyena]], [[Paradoxurus hermaphroditus|common palm civet]], [[small Indian civet]], Indian grey mongoose (''[[Herpestes edwardsi]]''), [[fishing cat]], [[leopard cat]], [[jungle cat]] and [[smooth-coated otter]]. Ungulates include [[blackbuck]], [[chital]], [[Sambar (deer)|sambar]], [[hog deer]], [[nilgai]] and [[wild boar]] and feral cattle.<ref name=\"Biology\" />\n\n====Other species====\nFish fauna of the park comprises 43 species, of which 37 enter the park along with the water from Ajan Bund, and six species are breeding residents. During a good rainy season the park receives around 65 million fish fry and fingerlings. The fish population and diversity are of high ecological importance as they form the food source of many birds.\n\nThe [[herpetofauna]] of Keoladeo National Park is diverse. Out of the ten species of turtles that are seen in Rajasthan, seven are present in this park. Besides this, there are five lizard species, thirteen snake species and seven species of amphibians.  The [[Hoplobatrachus crassus|bullfrog]] and [[skipper frog]] are commonly found in the wetlands.  It is often easy to see a [[Pythonidae|python]] out of its burrow and basking in the sun on a sunny winter day.  The common [[monitor lizard]], [[Indian porcupine]] and [[Hipposideros bicolor|bi-colored leaf-nose bat]] have been seen in the same burrow as that of the python. The venomous snakes found in the park are [[krait]], [[cobra]] and [[Russell\u2019s viper]].<ref name=\"Biology\" />\n\n==World Heritage Site==\n[[File:Eurasian spoonbill01.jpg|thumb|Eurasian spoonbill]]\nTo be included on the World Heritage List, sites must be of outstanding universal value and meet at least one out of ten selection criteria. These criteria are explained in the Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention which, besides the text of the Convention, is the main working tool on World Heritage. The criteria are regularly revised by the Committee to reflect the evolution of the World Heritage concept itself.  The UNESCO convention for listing goes on to explain the criteria the selection of Keoladeo Ghana National Park as a '''World Heritage Site under the Natural Criteria iv of Operational Guidelines 2002''' and the description which follows is that the park is a \u201cHabitat of rare and endangered species. The park is a wetland of international importance for migratory waterfowl. It is the wintering ground for the rare Siberian crane and habitat for large numbers of resident nesting birds.\u201d According to the revised '''Operational Guidelines of 2005''', the park falls under '''Criteria (x)''' which states that to be conferred the status of World Heritage, the site should \u201ccontain the most important and significant natural habitats for in-site conservation of biological diversity, including those containing threatened species of outstanding universal value from the point of view of science or conservation.\u201d<ref name=\"heritage site\" />\n\n==Management==\n\n===Issues===\nThe management objective is to allow the area to flood and dry out annually, rather than be maintained as a system of permanent marshes. Water for the wetlands is supplied from the dam outside the park boundaries. Usually, some 14.17 million cubic meters of water is the estimated annual requirement of the park. The water level inside the park is regulated by means of dykes and artificial embankments. The alternative arrangement of water in case of emergencies such as danger of marshes and water bodies drying out completely is ensured through four boreholes so that survival of the aquatic flora and fauna is not endangered before the arrival of monsoon. The boundaries of the park are clearly delineated by a thirty-two Kilometer long boundary encircling the park restricting the encroachment of humans and domestic cattle inside the perimeters of the park. The road from Bharatpur town which used to intersect the park was also closed and relocated outside the boundary to reduce the disturbance by visitors from the town which helped in bringing down the levels of pollution inside the park considerably. As opposed to most of the national parks in India and elsewhere, Bharatpur Bird sanctuary has no buffer zone. Due to the heavy density of population and more than 15 villages settled on the periphery of park, it was impossible for authorities to create a buffer zone around the bird sanctuary. Grazing and collection of firewood and grass was phased out from the park as far back as 1983.\n\n===Constraints===\nThe [[Siberian crane]], which formerly lived throughout the entire Indo-Gangetic plains of India, is reported to be no longer found in the area. Its absence has been attributed to hunting by nomadic tribes along the species' 5,000 mile migration route from Siberia to Bharatpur.\n\nSome 2,500 cattle and domestic [[water buffalo]] were allowed in the area up until November 1982 when grazing was banned. Predictably, the ban led to a buildup of local resentment, resulting in an attempted forced entry into the park. Police opened fire and eight people were killed: tensions still remain high.<ref>Lewis, M. 2003. ''Cattle and Conservation at Bharatpur: A case study in science and advocacy''. Conservation and Society 1: 1\u201321.</ref> The absence of grazing is causing management problems as vegetation, principally Paspalum distichum, a perennial amphibious grass, blocks up the channels. The Rajasthan government has rejected a proposal from the Bombay Natural History Society to allow limited grazing, since this would conflict with the law. Furthermore, recycled nutrients from the large quantity of dung deposited by livestock probably supported considerable numbers of insects.<ref name=\"PC Report\" />\n\nThe presence of some 700 feral cattle within the park is cause for concern as they compete with wildlife for valuable forage. [[Larva]]e of the [[Lepidoptera]]n ''[[Parapoynx diminutalis]]'' has also been a serious pest, and considerably inhibited the growth of ''[[Nymphoides cristatum]]'' during June\u2013July 1986. High levels of pollutants in Ajan Bund are believed to be responsible for the increasing number of piscivorous birds seen in a dazed state and unable to fly. Fewer birds were recorded in 1984 than in previous years. Four [[sarus crane]]s and 40 [[ring-necked dove]]s were found dead outside the park during 1988 and early 1989, possibly due to [[pesticide poisoning]], and a study of the impact of pesticide use in surrounding areas on the park has been initiated in addition to studies on heavy metal contamination. Disturbance from visitors can be a cause for concern, especially during December and January when visitors come to see the cranes.<ref name=\"research facilities\" />\n\nA non-native water hyacinth Icornia species was introduced in 1961, and has now proliferated to the extent that it is blocking the artificial waterways and filling the impoundments. This is significantly altering the habitat for many bird species, and is a serious management problem. Attempts to control the species have been ineffectual to date.\n\n==Tourism and visitor facilities==\nBy virtue of being one of the best bird watching sites of Asia, more than 100,000 visitors come to the park every year. The range of visitors varies from very serious birdwatchers to school children. Of the visitors, 45,000 are foreign tourists. In addition, the location of the park is such that tourists visiting Agra, Fatehpur Sikri and Jaipur invariably stop over at Bharatpur. The park opens from sunrise to sunset around the year. Food and accommodation facilities are available within the precincts of the park. The only accommodation inside the Keoladeo National Park is available in the property of government Bharatpur Ashoka Forest Lodge and lesser expensive Shanti Kutir, which is maintained and run by the ITDC. Bharatpur Forest Lodge is a quaint hotel in the vicinity of natural treasure trove of the park and has a total of 16 rooms to offer to visitors. Its circuit house and [[dak bungalow]] also offer good accommodation options.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Visitors coming to Bharatpur can also stay in palaces, havelis and other heritage properties converted into hotels. It is always advisable to have one\u2019s accommodation pre-booked, especially so during winters. An array of 3 star hotels and resorts are also located in the vicinity of the park where visitors can stay cozily.<ref name=\"Tourism\">[http://rajasthanwildlife.rajasthan.gov.in/wild-life/KeoladeoGhanaNationalPark.htm Tourism in Keoladeo National Park] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215101142/http://www.rajasthanwildlife.rajasthan.gov.in/wild-life/KeoladeoGhanaNationalPark.htm |date=15 February 2011 }}, Visitor facilities in Park.</ref>Besides the normal tourism activities and self-arranged bird watching tours of the Keoladeo National Park, visitors can also opt for a tour of this birding destination by selecting from an array of luxury tourist train services.

The society has recently intensified its operations and has established a hydro-biological station to monitor the ecology of the wetland. Particular attention will be given to any in dramatic change in the vegetation following the ban on grazing. Limnological studies have been carried out by the Zoology Department of the University of Rajasthan, Jaipur. The park authorities are monitoring the bird populations. A documentary film 'Indian birds of the monsoon' was produced by S. and B. Breeden in 1979\u20131980. The park has considerable potential for education, more so than other wetland sites in India, in view of it being relatively near to the cities of Agra, Delhi and Jaipur.\n\nBetween December 1992 and January 1995, a collaborative project between the Governments of India and Russia, International Crane Foundation and Wild Bird Society of Japan was set up to save the Siberian crane. The project focused on releasing captivity bred cranes into the wild, tracking migratory routes of common cranes, and building up the resident crane population in the park. Although the project did not yield the desired results, the successful survival of introduced cranes in the park has given sufficient hope to develop a viable resident population in the future.<ref name=\"research facilities\">[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Keoladeo_(Bharatpur)_National_Park,_India#gen6 Research and Field study initiatives], Scientific research at Keoladeo.</ref>\n\n==Crises of 2007==\n\nA proposal for water supply to Keoladeo National Park, Bharatpur was forwarded by the Government of Rajasthan seeking assistance from Planning Commission as advised and approved by the Ministry of Environment and Forests. Keeping in view the uniqueness of the ecosystem and the capacity to attract a variety of migratory birds the project was thought to be approved in principal with the caveat that the cost be firmed up after a visit to the site by an expert team. The park is in danger of being removed as a Ramsar Site as well as UNESCO World Heritage Site, due to severe drought and abandoning of the park midway by nesting birds in the year 2007.<ref name=\"Drought\">[http://www.thebagh.com/Bharatpur%20Springs%20back%20to%20life.pdf Link text], Drought at Keoladeo National Park.</ref>\n\nA proposal for water supply to Keoladeo National Park, Bharatpur was forwarded by the Government of Rajasthan seeking assistance from Planning Commission as advised and approved by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) vide their letter dated 10.04.2008.  As per the MoEF, the proposal is beyond the purview of the existing centrally sponsored scheme of the MoEF, seems to be viable and has the potential to put an end to the eternal [[water scarcity in India|water scarcity]] in Bharatpur National Park.\n\nThe Keoladeo National Park (KNP) is a Ramsar Wetland Site and a [[World Heritage site]].  Due to acute water scarcity, the ecosystem of the Park has been affected badly and this has resulted in reduction in the arrival of migratory birds in the National Park. Water supply is essential for the National Park, which is a wetland and a Ramsar site facing acute shortage of water for the last few years.  Currently, apart from rainfall the Park receives water from \u201cAjan Bund\u201d, a temporary reservoir via the Dakan canal.  Through a small canal dug last year water from Khokhar Weir (Bees Mora) is also available. The total requirement of water for the Park is estimated at about 14.17 million cubic meters (500 MCft).  The supply from Ajan Bund is irregular and subject to the bund being full to the extent of reservoir level at 8.5 meters. During the last several years either water is not supplied or supplied insufficiently.<ref name=\"PC Report\" />\n\nThe project had been prepared to keep in view the need for 400 MCFT of water during late July to August, for a period of 30 days to the Park which is to be had by diverting and lifting flood waters of Yamuna.  The project thus covered diversion of water during monsoon through underground pipes with lifting arrangements over a length of 16&nbsp;km from the off-take point of Goverdhan drain near Santruk village.  The estimated cost of the project as proposed by the State Government was to the tune of Rs. 650 million. The project proposed was to channelize water from Govardhan drain to meet the water deficit of KNP during the months of July to September at the time of requirement.  The major components of the project were construction of a head regulator with control gate at the drain located in the state, raw water reservoir with capacity of 13,000 m, 3 pump houses, DG sets for pumping station and laying and testing of /PCC/MS pipelines.<ref name=\"PC Report\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Arid Forest Research Institute]] (AFRI)\n* [[Kanwar Lake Bird Sanctuary|Kanwar Taal Bird Sanctuary]]\n* [[Sultanpur National Park|Sultanpur Bird Sanctuary]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Keoladeo National Park}}\n*{{webarchive |url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20021009114606/http%3A//www.wcmc.org.uk/protected_areas/data/wh/keoladeo.html |title=WCMC |date=2002-10-09}}\n*Reuters: [https://web.archive.org/web/20071223122111/http://today.reuters.com/News/CrisesArticle.aspx?storyId=DEL95384 Drought-ridden Indian bird park loses its birds].

''Psychoanalytic Studies of Personality'', a 1952 collection of Fairbairn's papers previously published in various psychoanalytic journals, includes four papers that contain most of his innovative concepts. \n\nFairbairn's model is  classified as a psychoanalytic model or theory because it shares the common assumption of all psychoanalytic models\u2014the belief that the fundamental source of human motivation originates in the unconscious\u2014as well as offering explanations of the origins and dynamics of transference, repetition compulsions, and resistance. His enormously ambitious goal was to replace Freudian [[metapsychology]] with his own. Fairbairn's vision of the human psyche was not based on the Freudian notion that the infant is overflowing with primitive drives needing to be tamed, but rather that the infant is seeking love and emotional attachment that can infuse him with the security he needs to explore the world, safe in the knowledge that he has parents ready to help him if he becomes overwhelmed in that exploration. Fairbairn's model offers a different theory of psychological development, a completely new vision of the structure and dynamics of the personality, a different source of the origins of psychopathology, and a different approach to the treatment of disordered individuals. Fairbairn's model also shifts the focus away from repression (of the Id's forbidden desires) and back to dissociation as humans' fundamental defense mechanism. \n\nGreenberg and Mitchell noted the basic changes promoted by Fairbairn:  \n<blockquote>\nIn a series of dense and fertile papers written during the early 1940's, W.R.D. Fairbairn developed a theoretical perspective which, along with Sullivan's \"interpersonal psychiatry\", provides the purest and clearest expression of the shift from the drive/structure model to the relational/structure model (Greenberg and Mitchell, 1983:151).<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Greenberg and Mitchell|first=Jay  and Stephen|title=Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-62975-2|location=|pages=151}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe psychoanalytic model Freud offers is a '''drive/structure model''': it proposes that human beings are born with innate, biological drives (e.g., sexual desire and aggression) contained in the unconscious Id. The infant's Id seeks discharge of its tensions regardless of the situation. When the discharging drive (hitting, biting, urinating, defecating) comes into contact with the demands and prohibitions of society, there is immediate conflict. A new structure must emerge from the Id of the growing infant to insure that its drives are expressed in a socially acceptable way. Thus the unconscious Id\u2014Freud's metaphor for the whole range and strength of biological drives\u2014is forced to develop contact with reality through the emergence of a second structure: the Ego. Thus the Ego has the task of mediating between the primitive Id and society. Later on in development (via the Oedipal Conflict), the child internalizes the values of his parents. These internalized values become the third internal structure, which is called the Super Ego. These three hypothetical ego structures\u2014Id, Ego, and Super Ego\u2014mature and grow with experience. Freud postulated that all psychological development is based on the Id seeking satisfaction, the Ego curbing the Id's most extreme demands, and the Super Ego pressing the Ego to make morally correct choices. \n\nIn contrast, Fairbairn's is a '''relational/structure model''' in its assumption that the human psyche develops its structure from actual human experience, not from pressure from the Id, whose existence Fairbairn rejects. Instead, Fairbairn proposes that the human psyche develops structures based on actual interpersonal events. A child's growing and maturing internal ego structures can be understood as packages of memories that coalesce and form internal representations of the parents, of the child himself, and of the child's relationship to his parents. For Fairbairn, the unconscious develops as a consequence of empathic failures of the parents that are too disruptive for the child's underdeveloped central ego to tolerate. Awareness of these failures would interfere with the child's absolute dependency on his parents, and knowledge of them would destroy the necessary illusion that he is loved and cherished. In families where punishment is frequent and severe, parental failures can be catastrophic to the child's developing sense of self. That is, the child can be so overwhelmed by parental aggression that it faces the loss of its sense of self, as described by Bromberg:     <blockquote>\nPsychological trauma occurs in situations, explicitly or implicitly interpersonal, in which self-invalidation (sometimes self-annihilation) cannot be escaped from or prevented, and from which there is no hope of protection, relief, or soothing. If the experience is either prolonged, [sic] assaultively violent, or if self-development is weak or immature, then the level of affective arousal is too great for the event to be experienced self-reflectively and given meaning through cognitive processing. \u2026 At its extreme, the subjective experience is that of a chaotic and terrifying flooding of affect that threatens to overwhelm sanity and psychological survival (Bromberg, 1998, 12).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bromberg|first=Philip|title=Standing in The Spaces: Essays on Clinical Process, Trauma and Dissociation|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=0-88163-356-9|location=|pages=12}}</ref>     \n</blockquote>\nOver time, these dissociated events, including those in which the child's sense of self was endangered, become ego structures in the individual's internal world. (See the following section on splitting of the ego for a detailed explanation of this process.) Thus the human psyche acquires structure from the tensions of split-off traumas so toxic they remain unavailable to the individual's central ego. Therefore, the unconscious is not a biological inheritance of humankind but a development of specific parental failures and interpersonal traumas that were dissociated because they were too disruptive to remember.\n\n===='Schizoid Factors in the Personality' (1940)====\n\nIn his first paper, Fairbairn observed that many of his patients seemed \"schizoid\", which he defined as any individual who showed evidence of  having '''splits in their ego structure''' directly resulting from dissociated memories in their central ego. (Today we would call these patients Personality Disordered.) The dissociated packages of memories are held in the unconscious, \"split-off\" from the conscious central ego which no longer knows that they exist. Thus, many reality-based traumas are no longer known to the individual, who becomes withdrawn for interpersonal interactions. Fairbairn defined the schizoid as having the three following characteristics: <blockquote>\n\u2026 (1) an attitude of omnipotence, (2) an attitude of isolation and detachment and, (3) a preoccupation with inner reality.\u2026 So as far as the preoccupation with inner reality is concerned, this is undoubtedly the most important of all schizoid characteristics; and it is not the less present whether inner reality be substituted for outer reality, identified with outer reality, or superimposed upon outer reality (Fairbairn, 1952, p:6-7).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Fairbairn|first=William Ronald Dodds|title=Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=0-7100-1361-2|location=London|pages=}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe more frequently a child encounters intolerable trauma, the larger the number of memories of actual lived experiences that are split off and unavailable to the conscious \"central ego\". The schizoid style of relating (or more accurately, non-relating) to others originates from repeated rejections of the child's legitimate need for love and emotional support during his developmental years. The schizoid child was raised by a mother who was unable to relate to her child with tender, loving emotions, and as a direct consequence of this rejection, the child withdraws into his inner world, which, though safer, is ultimately less satisfying. Fairbairn spells this out starkly:\n<blockquote>\nRegressive reinstatement of the early oral attitude (the earliest form of dependency) would appear to be most readily brought about by a situation of emotional frustration in which the child comes to feel (a) that he is not really loved for himself as a person by his mother, and (b) that his own love for his mother is not really valued and accepted by her. This is a highly traumatic situation, giving rise to a further situation characterized as follows: (a) the child comes to regard his mother as a Bad Object in so far as she does not seem to love him, (b) The child comes to regard outward expressions of his own love as bad, with the result that ... he tends to retain his love inside of himself. (c) The child comes to feel that love relationships with external objects in general are bad, or at least precarious (Fairbairn, 1952:17-18).<ref name=\":2\" /> \n</blockquote>\nFairbairn recognized that lack of love in a young child's life is traumatic and disruptive to his attachment. In his later papers (1943 &1944),he observed that the child protected himself from remembering these traumatic events by using  the dissociative defense to erase them form his conscious memory. \n\nFairbairn thought about, and wrote about the issue of the child's dependency on his mother in each of his four early papers as he was expanding his observations while creating a coherent model. For example, in a quote from his 1941 paper (which will be described in the next section) on the issue of frustration of legitimate dependency needs as one of the causal factors leading to the schizoid personality style, Fairbairn observes that the unloved child feels his love is destructive because his parents do not value or accept it, and because they do not return his love. Thus the child '''blames himself''' for not being lovable, which deflects the blame from his unloving parents on to himself. By blaming himself, he continues the illusion that he has loving parents that reject him for a good reason, i.e., that he and his love are toxic. This theme will come up again in the 1943 paper when Fairbairn described \"The Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\" a cognitive defense in which the child blames himself for the parental failures. In the next quote, Fairbairn uses the Freudian concept of 'libido', which was defined as the mix of sex and aggression in the Id. Fairbairn was forced to use the preexisting language of psychoanalysis, however he took the word \"libido\" and changed it to mean a child's love for his parents or love of other external objects:<blockquote>\nIt is the great tragedy of the schizoid individual that his love seems to destroy: and it is because his love seems so destructive that he experiences such difficulty in directing libido toward objects in outer reality. He becomes afraid to love: and therefore he erects barriers between his objects and himself. He tends to both keep his objects at a distance and to make himself remote from them. He rejects his objects: and at the same time he withdraws libido from them. This withdrawal of libido may be carried to all lengths. It may be carried to a point at which all emotional and physical contacts with other persons are renounced; and it may even go so far that all libidinal links with outer reality are surrendered, all interest in the world around fades and everything becomes meaningless. In proportion as libido is withdrawn from outer objects it is directed toward internalized objects: and in proportion as this happens the person becomes introverted (Fairbairn 1952, p.50)<ref name=\":2\" />.    \n</blockquote>\nSimply put, the unloved child who has directed his love toward his parents, only to be rebuffed, gives up hope that he will ever be loved, and as a consequence holds his love inside. He gives up on human relationships, focusing instead on his inner world and its fantasies and dreams of success.\n\n===='A Revised Psychopathology of the Psychoses and Psychoneuroses  (1941)'====\nFairbairn was gradually forming his model in these first papers. He  challenged Freud's drive theory directly in this second paper by  stating \"Nevertheless, it would appear as if the point had now been reached at which, in the interest of progress, the classical libido theory would have to be transformed into ''a theory of development based essentially upon object-relationships,'' Fairbairn (1952,p,31).<ref name=\":2\" />  Unfortunately, the shift in focus from drive theory to object relations theory was far too great for the psychoanalytic community to accept, because Freud's entire model was based on the existence and activity of libidinal drives. All of psychoanalysis was Freudian in the 1940s, there were no other options, and yet Fairbairn asked his colleagues to choose between his model and Freud's. They overwhelming chose Freud. From this point on, his model was seen as an \"interesting\" philosophical and intellectual exercise, rather than as a viable analytic model that would, over time, become one of the foundational models of \"Relational Psychoanalysis\" of simply \"Relationality\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Stephen|title=Relationality: From Attachment to Intersubjectivity|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=2000|isbn=0-88163-322-4|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell, Stephen & Aron, Lewis|first=|title=Relational Psychoanalysis: The Emergence of a Tradition|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=1999|isbn=0-88163-270-8|location=|pages=}}</ref>.\nFairbairn proposed an outline of a developmental model in this chapter as well. He noted that human development was characterized by a gradual differentiation (separation both physically and psychologically) from the parent because of the emergence  of a mature, reality based, central ego in the young adult. This allows the young adult to begin life on his own, find a partner and produce the next generation.<blockquote>The development of object-relationships is essentially a process whereby infantile dependence upon the object gradually gives place to mature dependence upon the object. The process of development is characterized (a) by the gradual abandonment of an original object relationship based on primary identification, and (b) the gradual adoption of an object-relationship based upon differentiation of the object (Fairbairn, 1952, p.34)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the development proceeds, the child gradually realizes that he is not part of his mother, but rather is an independent, fully functioning person. Unfortunately, many children are not supported and loved sufficiently to go through the \"transitional\" stage easily. They do not feel  secure and cannot engage in age appropriate activity with their peers. Instead, they are looking backwards toward their mother for more support, rather than toward the outside world of other children and healthy play. Fairbairn noted this in one of his most famous quotes:<blockquote>\nThe greatest need of a child is to obtain conclusive assurance (a) that he is genuinely loved as a person by his parents, and (b) that his parents genuinely accept his love. It is only in so far as such assurance is forthcoming in a form sufficiently convincing to enable him to depend safely upon his real objects (parents) that he is able to gradually renounce infantile dependence without misgiving. In the absence of such assurance his relationships to his objects is fraught with too much anxiety over separation to enable him to renounce the attitude of infantile dependence: for such a renunciation would be equivalent in his eyes to forfeiting all hope of ever obtaining the satisfaction of his unsatisfied emotional needs. '''Frustration of his desire to be loved as a person, and frustration of his desire to have his love accepted, is the greatest trauma that a child can experience''' (Fairbairn, 1952, p.39-40)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the dependent child cannot mature and go on to the next developmental step as he is fearful of increased separation from his parents without being sure of their love and support. The loved child does receive support and encouragement which gives him enough courage to let them go, and establish new relationships with peers and future partners. The child who is unsure of his parents' love remains emotionally underdeveloped, and often remains at home, trying to obtain the love that was not forthcoming in his developmental history (Celani, 2005)<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=Leaving Home|publisher=Columbia Universities Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13477-4|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>.  \n\nThe unloved child attempts to avoid further emotional rebuffs  by becoming increasingly \"schizoid\". That is, he turns away from the harsh and unloving world of his family and towards his internalized memories of others, including his parents, for reassurance that they are with him and available at all times. Unfortunately, most of his internalized memories are negative (see the relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object in the Splitting section). Despite the negativity, the endless struggle between these internalized split off part self and part object provides the comfort of the known and familiar. Clearly, this is a half measure, but it is the best that the ignored or rejected child can do under the circumstances, as he cannot change his parents or force them to love him.   \n\nSecondly, the rejected child comforts himself with \"substitutive satisfactions\"  which Fairbairn assumed were forms of immature sexuality. Today, the unloved, schizoid child has only to turn to the internet for an endless number of fantasy based videos that compensate him for his lack of love, lack of power,  and his desire for revenge, which temporarily lessens his pain. Fairbairn was clear about this regressive return to the inner world because of the harshness of the external world: \"Fundamentally, these substitutive satisfactions ...all represent ''relationships with internalized objects, to which the individual is compelled to turn in default of satisfactory relationships with objects in the outer world\"(Italics in the original) Fairbairn, 1952, p.40)''<ref name=\":2\" />. This observation of Fairbairn's has been validated by the millions of alienated and unloved children who spend hour upon hour avoiding interactions with external reality, including their family members, while immersed in their video fantasy world. This is the most satisfaction that they can get from their lives, as their relationships with their parents are so frustrating. \n\nFairbairn also discussed the difficulties in separating from unloving parents in this 1941 paper. He recognized that the lack of early support left the child with very few emotional resources to sustain himself when he left home and faced the world alone. He called the stage between \"infantile dependence\" and \"mature interdependence' the stage of \"Transition\".<blockquote>The great conflict of the transition stage may now be formulated as a conflict between a progressive urge to surrender the infantile attitude of identification with the object and a regressive urge to maintain that attitude. During this period, accordingly, the behavior of the individual is characterized both by desperate endeavors on his part to separate from the object and desperate endeavors to achieve reunion with the object-desperate attempts \"to escape from prison' and desperate attempts \"to return home\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.43).<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>The less the child has been supported in his early years, the less chance he/she has of a successful transition into adulthood. The huge number of \"adult\" aged individuals who either live at home with their aging parents, or others who live separately, but remain fixated in an adolescent time warp, is enormous. In either case, they have been unable to enter mature relationships because they are still seeking the support and encouragement that they missed out on in childhood <ref name=\":5\" />.   \n\n===='The Repression and the Return of Bad Objects (1943)' ====\nFairbairn's third theoretical paper further alienated those few members of the analytic community who found his work acceptable as he had the temerity to once again urge the replacement of drive theory with his object relations theory.<blockquote>Amongst the conclusions formulated in the above mentioned paper (his 1941 paper) two of the most far reaching are the following:(1) that libidinal \"aims\" are of secondary importance in comparison with object-relationships and (2) that a relationship with the object, and not gratification of the impulse, is the ultimate aim of libidinal striving (Fairbairn, 1952, p.60)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>Later on, in the same paper, Fairbairn added another comment that further alienated his analytic colleagues:  <blockquote>A point has now been reached at which the theory (Freud's Libido theory) has outworn its usefulness and, so far from providing impetus for further progress within the field of psychoanalytical thought, is actually operating as a brake upon the wheels (Fairbairn, 1952, p.72)<ref name=\":2\" />  </blockquote>This is '''not''' what the analytic community was looking for in 1943, as Fairbairn reduced Freud's concept of Libido to a secondary position as he described his unique  vision of the child's motivation. He saw that all children sought out  good objects, in the hope of establishing  a loving  relationship with another human being. He then formally re-defined the human unconscious, not as a container of biological drives, but rather a compendium of memories of interpersonal events that were too destructive to the child's needed attachment to his parents for his developing ego to accept. Fairbairn's \"challenge\" of the Freudian model did not pose a problem for the analytic community, despite the fact that Fairbairn's unconscious was so different from the \"standard\" Freudian view, simply because his model was politely ignored for forty years until 1983, until the publication of Greenberg and Mitchell's book \"Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory\",<ref name=\":6\" />. This alerted the younger members of the psychoanalytic community about Fairbairn's theory of psychoanalysis, and the renewed interest provoked numerous publications.  <blockquote>I now venture to formulate the view that what are primarily repressed are neither intolerably guilty impulses nor intolerably unpleasant memories, but intolerably bad internalized objects. If memories are repressed, accordingly, this is only because the objects involved in such memories are identified with bad internalized objects (Fairbairn, 1952,p.62)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>This assertion by Fairbairn: that the unconscious is composed of dissociated memories of parental failures was simply too much for the analytic community to bear. He dismissed Freud's notion of an unconscious populated by biological forces that were seen to be (at that time)  the fundamental motivator of humankind. In Fairbairn's model, the dissociated memories  in the unconscious resonate throughout the individual's life. Note that Fairbairn was ahead of himself in this quote because  he had not yet defined a \"'''bad object'''\", which is a parent or guardian that the child looks to for love, help, guidance, and support, and who fails the child again and again. Also note that Fairbairn uses the word '''repressed''' rather than '''dissociated''' in this quote. Repression is used to describe the psychological defense of holding of material in the unconscious that is already present. Dissociation describes the psychological act of actively \"forgetting\" an overwhelmingly traumatic event that occurred in the external world, and instantaneously forcing it into the unconscious. Once the memory of the event is there it is held out of awareness by repression.           \n\nFairbairn also offered a clear pathway from dissociated memories of neglect and abuse to adult psychopathology in the following passage.  <blockquote>Whether any given individual becomes delinquent, psychoneurotic, psychotic or simply \"normal\" would appear to depend in the main upon the operation of three factors: (1) the extent to which bad objects have been installed in the unconscious, and the degree of badness by which they are characterized, (2) the extent to which the ego is identified with internalized bad objects, and (3) the nature and strength of the defenses which protect the ego from these objects (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>The child who is so unfortunate to be born in a family where the parents are absent, indifferent or abusive is going to experience and internalize a huge number of bad object interactions. These dissociated memories coalesce and form large and powerful inner structures that will influence his view of himself and his perception of external reality. The second point in the quote describes how the individual's identification with the abuser can exacerbate the impact of the dissociated memories. For instance a boy who sees his father beat his mother may identify with this behavior and then re-enact this pattern in his adulthood. Conversely a female child might dis-identify with her father and, in adulthood, support abused women. The third factor, \"Defensiveness\" is also significant as the highly defended individual will remember little or nothing of the traumas he/she experienced in childhood. As a consequence, these individuals  have a greater probability of re-enacting one role or the other (the abuser of the victim) because they  have no ability to \"mentalize\", or think about and  process the traumatic events of their childhood. Thus, the highly defended individual will never comprehend what happened to them, and realize how their early history  influenced their adulthood. Instead, the internalized patterns will re-emerge and be acted out with the next generation. This is called the \"intergenerational transmission of trauma\".                  \n\nFairbairn also noticed that children who had been removed from their families because of extreme neglect or abuse (this was in Scotland during the 1930's) made endless excuses for their parents and assumed that they themselves were responsible for the treatment that they were receiving. That is, their parents were punishing them because they were dirty, disobedient, or lazy. The child assumed that he/she was the cause of the parent's hostile behavior toward them. Fairbairn called this the '''\"Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\"'''. Once again the child is desperate to support his illusion that he/she is living within a loving family, and that he/she is the cause of the strife.         <blockquote>It becomes obvious, therefore, that the child would rather be bad himself than have bad objects: and accordingly we have some justification for surmising that one of his motives in becoming bad is to make his objects \"good\". In becoming bad he is really taking upon himself the burden of badness which appears to reside in his objects. By this means he seeks to purge them of his badness: and in proportion as he succeeds in doing so, he is rewarded by that sense of security which an environment of good objects so characteristically confers....Outer security is thus purchased at the price of inner insecurity (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>This defense is a cognitive defense in that the child is using logic to explain to himself why he is being punished or neglected. By saying it is his fault, he absolves his parents and gives them a \"good\" reason for treating him badly. As Fairbairn notes, it continues the pattern used by children to support the illusion that they are living in a loving family. The child prefers to believe that he has a \"moral\" defect, such as being lazy, disrespectful, or being chronically dirty, all of which are potentially correctable, than see that his parents are emotionally bankrupt and indifferent to his welfare. Worse, the defensive self blame erodes what little self worth the child may have developed. This defense is really a precursor to the splitting defense that Fairbairn described in his next paper (1944), in that it is a primitive form of splitting in that the parental objects are \"all good\", and the child himself is \"all bad\". Fairbairn never went back to his earlier concepts, like the moral defense, and updated them to fit in with his evolving thought.                 \n\nThen Fairbairn returned to his earlier discussion, that he had begun in his 1940 and 1941 papers, on different aspects of the child's dependency on his objects. These concepts would have been more appropriate in his earlier papers where he first discussed the issue of dependency. However, the reader is given an opportunity to actually see how a major innovator of a psychoanalytic theory gradually creates a model. His mind was not linear, and many topics came to mind again and again, dependency being the most frequent topic. Here he observes the intense need of the child for his parents and the child's inability to reject them, regardless of how badly he/she was being treated:        <blockquote>The child not only internalizes his bad objects because they force themselves upon him and he seeks to control them, but also, and above all, because he ''needs'' them. If a child's parents are bad objects, he cannot eject them, even if they do not force themselves upon him: for he cannot do without them. '''Even if they neglect him, he cannot reject them: for if they neglect him, his need for them is increased''' (Fairbairn, 1952,p.67)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>Fairbairn made this revolutionary observation and, at the time, it went unnoticed. The '''neglected child needs the parent more, rather than less''' because the individual's earlier needs were never fulfilled, and they do not suddenly disappear or resolve themselves. This observation seems counter-intuitive when seen from an adult perspective, because a mature individual would leave a hostile or unloving interpersonal situation in a minute.  However, the reality of many  young adults from neglectful families is that their own unmet dependency needs pressure them to remain with their abusive parents.They may have unmet needs from age 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (and so on) that were  never met, so as a young adult this individual has '''no possibility whatsoever of separating''' from his neglectful parents, and beginning a life of his own. This was one of Fairbairn's great insights which can be seen in virtually all young patients.                                                                  \n\nFairbairn then took up new topics in the same wide-ranging paper- which is one of his two greatest (the second being his 1944 paper, which will be described in the next section). The two topics were (1) his theory of treatment and (2) his view of resistance. Most of his work focuses on the Bad Object, and the many psychological problems it fostered. In this section of the paper he begins to think about the effects of a '''Good Object-''' one that fulfills the promise of being nurturant, loving, and supportive. As mentioned earlier, Fairbairn's model is symmetrical, in that good objects which are available and conscious (and which ideally should be present in every child's life) have the opposite effect as compared to bad objects. Here he notes that they can actually cure or at least mitigate, the effects of internalized bad objects.                 <blockquote>Nevertheless, I cannot help feeling that such results must be attributed, in part at least, to the fact that in the transference situation the patient is provided in reality with an unwontedly good object, and is thereby placed in a position to risk a release of his internalized bad objects from the unconscious and so to provide conditions for the libidinal cathexis of these objects to be dissolved--albeit he is also under a temptation to exploit a \"good\" relationship with the analyst, as a defense against taking this risk (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69).<ref name=\":2\" />                  </blockquote>Fairbairn identifies one of the key mutative factors in psychotherapy as the \"good relationship\" between the therapist and patient. The influence of a good object therapist should provoke a derepression (a release from the unconscious) of the memories of abuse and neglect that were previously unavailable to his conscious central ego. He sees the relationship between patient and therapist as providing the patient with enough confidence and support to allow him to \"remember\" what actually happened to him, as he has a new object upon whom he can depend. He  uses the word \"libidinal cathexis\" in his quote which is a holdover from the Freudian model. It means emotional investment of libidinal energy in the other person, which when translated into Fairbairn's terminology, means emotional attachment. Thus a relationship with a new, good object can loosen up the attachment to an internalized bad object, as the good object offers the patient an alternative attachment. In reality, this process seldom happens until treatment is well underway,  At the outset of treatment most patients stubbornly cling to their  illusions that they were raised in a loving and supportive family as well as to the illusion that they are somehow defective and deserving of neglect or abuse.\n\n==== Resistance to Treatment Based on the Toxicity of the Internalized Bad Objects ====\nThe 1943  paper's title \"Repression and the Return of Bad Objects\" suggests that Fairbairn was going to address the reemergence of bad objects, which he does in a  comment on one of the fundamental sources of '''Resistance.''' The prior quote on the effects of a good object as a catalyst to de-repression of the internalized toxic memories did not take resistance into account. Resistance describes the patient's attempts to remain the same and fight against the therapist's interventions during the process of psychotherapy, despite their conscious desire to change. As previously noted, Fairbairn's model is coherent, and given that the source of psychopathology is the internalization of bad objects because they were intolerable to accept, resistance comes from the patient's fear of acknowledging and accepting what happened to him in childhood despite the fact that these events occurred decades ago. This is true even if the parents are long deceased, because for the patient to accept what they did to him/her as a child will, in most cases, destroy all his illusions about them as parents and the \"goodness\" of his childhood. It also leaves the individual without a personal history, as he has to give up all his fantasies of being a member of a family and instead, see himself as an unloved and discarded child. For a detailed description of how to manage patient resistance during the process of treatment see Celani, 2010 (pp,117-184)<ref name=\":4\" />. \n\nFairbairn's quote on resistance is graphic and to the point.<blockquote>There is little doubt in my mind that, in conjunction with another factor to be mentioned later, the deepest source of resistance is fear of the release of bad objects from the unconscious: for when such bad objects are released, the world around the patient becomes '''peopled with devils which are too terrifying for him to face'''...At the same time there is now little doubt in my mind that the release of bad objects from the unconscious is one of the chief aims which the psychotherapist should set himself out to achieve, even at the expense of a severe \"transference neurosis\": for it is only when the internalized bad objects are released from the unconscious that there is any hope of their cathexis being dissolved. The bad objects can only be safely released, however, if the analyst has become established as a sufficiently good object for the patient. Otherwise the resulting insecurity may prove insupportable (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69-70)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>Fairbairn's clinical observation regarding the difficulty for patients to actually reexamine and tolerate the events that they '''had already suffered through,''' is absolutely correct. Exposure of the patient to the realities of his childhood can only be successfully managed when the patient is securely attached to the therapist as a good object, and thus will not feel abandoned when the illusions about his parents fall away. Fairbairn was both a philosopher and an advanced divinity student before becoming a physician and psychoanalyst, and often his language involves devils and angels, as it does in this quote. Later on the next page he ends his comment on resistance with the statement: \"It becomes evident, accordingly, that the psychotherapist is the true successor to the exorcist, and that he is concerned, not only with \"the forgiveness of sins\", but also with \"the casting out of devils\"\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.70)<ref name=\":2\" />. Thus he equates bad internalized objects with devils, who tempt the individual to follow self-destructive paths. Specifically, trying to force love out of an unloving parent, or conversely, demanding that a rejecting parent learns to appreciate and value a disparaged child are two examples of self- destructive attachments.  \n<br />\n\n=== Endopsychic Structure Considered in terms of Object Relationships (1944) ===\n{{Main|Splitting of the Ego}}\nFairbairn, as mentioned, was continually amplifying and refining his observations regarding children's dependency on their parents. This was also true for his 1944 paper, which contains a detailed description of the impossible dilemma that the rejected child faces. Here, he highlights the crushing emotionality experienced by the child when his needs are rejected, and the impossibly  frustrating position he is forced into, one in which he cannot complain about his rejection for fear of increased rejection while simultaneously he cannot express his love or his need. The following quote demonstrates Fairbairn's writing at its best along with his unparalleled sensitivity to children's needs.   <blockquote>From the latter standpoint, what he experiences is a sense of lack of love, and indeed of emotional ''rejection'' on his mother's part. This being so, the expression of hate toward her as a rejecting object becomes in his eyes a very dangerous procedure. On the one hand, it is calculated to make her reject him all the more, and thus increase her badness and make her seem ''more real'' in her capacity as a bad object. On the other hand it is calculated to make her love him less, and thus to decrease her \"goodness' and make her seem ''less real'' (ie: destroy her) in her capacity of a good object. At the same time it also becomes a dangerous procedure for the child to express his libidinal need , i.e.his nascent love, of his mother in the face of rejection at her hands...In an older child this experience (showing love to a parent and having it rejected) is one of intense humiliation over the depreciation of his love, which seems to be involved. At a somewhat deeper level, or at an earlier stage, the experience is one of shame over the display of needs which are disregarded or belittled. In virtue of these experiences of humiliation and shame he feels reduced to a state of '''worthlessness,''' '''destitution''' or '''beggardom'''. His sense of his own value is threatened: and he feels bad in the sense of \"inferior (Fairbairn, 1952,pp.112-113)<ref name=\":2\" />   </blockquote>Thus the child can neither complain about his treatment for fear that he will be treated even more horribly, nor does he dare to offer his love to a parent who might reject and belittle him, as he has experienced in the past. The child has no where to go and no one from whom he can seek help or appeal to, which is the position that millions of children are caught in at any given moment in time. Fairbairn gained his many insights to the plight of children from his work in the orphanage attached to the hospital in Edinburgh in which he worked (1927-1935)<ref name=\":7\" />, and he never forgot those experiences. \n\n==== An Outline of Fairbairn's Structural Model ====\nFairbairn's 1944 paper introduced the psychoanalytic community to his alternative view of the structure of the human personality which he saw as being the result of dissociation of intolerably frustrating experiences with the individuals parents. Before he introduced his model he commented on the ability of one structure (or sub-self) to repress another sub-self, and in so doing, become the executive (dominant) ego structure.<blockquote>It is not inconceivable that one part of the \"ego\" with a dynamic charge should repress another part of the \"ego\" with a dynamic charge..In order to account for repression, we thus appear to be driven to the necessity of assuming a certain '''multiplicity of egos''' (Fairbairn, 1952, p.90)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>The ability of one ego state to repress another ego state is the central dynamic of the unconscious in Fairbairn's model. It accounts for the shifting of ego states that can occur when dissociated material has been de-repressed and temporarily  \"known\" material that the central ego sees and accepts, has to be suddenly forced out of awareness and replaced by another view of reality. His model sees psychopathology as an endless series of shifting ego states which protect the individual from the harsh realities of their childhood, but simultaneously, disrupts their life because of the incomplete views of themselves and the incomplete views of people around them.     \n\nFairbairn's 1944  structural theory emerged from his careful and detailed analysis of a patient's dream (Fairbairn, 1952, pp.95-106)<ref name=\":2\" />. He observed that the patient had separate views of herself and of her significant others that could be understood as part-selves and part objects. Fairbairn saw that there were three pairs of structures- one pair was conscious and the other two pairs were largely unconscious.The fundamental position of Object Relations Theory is that for every developing self there has to be a object to whom it relates, thus every pair of structures contains a version of self paired with a version of the object (other person) to whom the self structure was relating. The two conscious structures are the  '''The Central Ego''' (the self structure) and its relationship to the '''Ideal Object''' (the other) , and '''two pairs of unconscious structures.''' The first pair of (mostly unconscious structures) are  '''The Antilibidinal Ego''' (the self structure, which Fairbairn originally called the \"internal saboteur\") is an internal  representation of the neglected, humiliated and enraged child in a relationship to the '''Rejecting Object''', (the object structure) which is an internal representation of the abusive parent. The second pair of unconscious structures are  '''The Libidinal Ego''' (the self structure) which is the child's fantasy of the good parent whom he wishes for and his relationship to the '''Exciting Object''' (the object structure) which is a fantasy representation of the loving parent who offers him hope for the future. In extremely negative families there are so few supportive, positive interactions with the parents that the child is forced, by necessity to create hope for himself by developing a second set of views of himself in relationship to his parent. In Fairbairn's model '''the need of the child for a positive parent is so intense that the deprived child creates a \"good\" parent''' out of fantasy and hope.  This  second vision of the parent (mis)perceives the parent as filled with the potential of love. This vision of the parent is built out of the occasional positive or tender interaction that the child has experienced with his mostly rejecting parents.  The attachments of these  two mostly unconscious selves to these part objects constitutes what Fairbairn defined as an attachment to the '''Bad Object'''.  The Bad Object has two facets: the antilibidinal ego argues with and complains about its mistreatment to the rejecting object in an attempt to reform it, while the libidinal ego seeks ways to find out how to please the exciting object which promises it love which is always out of reach. Neither part-self (antilibidinal ego, libidinal ego) is willing to give up their quest, and neither part object (rejecting object and exciting object) is willing to concede defeat, and neither of the object representations (rejecting or exciting) is willing to give either of the child's two selves any satisfaction.      \n\n'''Dissociation and the Splitting of the Ego'''  \n\nPrior to Fairbairn, the defense of dissociation was seen as an extreme defense that was only used  in life-threatening situations. Fairbairn's work in an orphanage convinced him that  children separated from their families had experienced a major trauma that required the dissociative defense to prevent a complete psychic collapse. The dissociative defense erased the event from their consciousness. The memory of the abandonment  along with the  memory of the parents reasons for their actions are forced into the unconscious and held there by repression. This allows the abandoned child to continue loving a parent that he/she sees as completely supportive. In families where rejection is commonplace, the thousands upon thousands of dissociated memories accrue and become powerful sub-personalities. Memories of the angry, annoyed, rejecting or indifferent parent coalesce in the child's unconscious and become a single representation of the angry parent already described as the rejecting object. The child must also dissociate memories of himself during the interpersonally rejecting interactions into the antilibidinal ego. These memories of the child's self as suffused with fear, defeat, shame and humiliation that cannot be tolerated consciously.     \n\n'''The Splitting''' '''Defense''' allows the child to hate the rejecting object with a feral rage, and to love the exciting object with all its heart. Splitting is a defense that prevents the integration of Good and Bad Object memories into a single whole object. Thus, the individual  '''never develops \"object constancy\"''' which is the ability to see a person's goodness, even when they are being rejected or frustrated by that person. Thus, a very important developmental milestone is not achieved, and the individual functions at an earlier stage of psychological  development, often throughout life. Splitting causes the individual to respond to external objects '''as if they were two different people.''' When the individual is frustrated they see the object as '''\"all bad\"''' and devoid of any goodness. Conversely, when they are dominated by their  libidinal ego structure they see the object as \"'''all good'''\". This style of relating to the world defines the Borderline Personality disorder (Celani, 1993,2010 <ref>{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=The Treatment of the Borderline Patient: Applying Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting|publisher=International Universities Press|year=1993|isbn=0-8236-6644-1|location=|pages=}}</ref> <ref name=\":4\" />. Fairbairn described this shift in ego states in the earlier quote that addressed the fact that one ego state could repress another ego state, resulting in a person who experiences the world through a \"multiplicity of egos\". Developmentally, this is equivalent to the child who screams at her mother in a rage, and moments  later says \"I love you, Mommy\". The dominant ego state has no awareness of the other ego state which has just been repressed. Equally importantly, powerful, emotion filled memories are dissociated, which impoverishes and weakens the central ego, which is unaware of significant realities from its developmental history, and is unable to hold onto a single view of their interpersonal world<ref>{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|url=|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting Columbia University Press|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=|pages=|oclc=}}</ref>. \n\n==== Resistance Based on the Two Sub Ego's Mission to Reform the Object ====\n\nThe reality that Fairbairn's structural theory contains six different structures is a source of difficulty in terms of its adoption by the analytic community, as it is more complex than Freud's three structure theory. It also forces the user to think in terms of self and object, rather that the individual in isolation. This model represents a whole new vision of the psychological functioning of the human personality, which is very different to the original Libido Theory. Fairbairn's model is one of relationships in which there are constant dialogues between the structures. That is, the relational pattern that was internalized during childhood includes  typical dialogues that were originally experienced in the external world, but now continue in the internal world. For example the antagonistic and bickering  relationship between the antilibidinal ego and the internalized rejecting object  continues unabated in dialogues between them, as described by Ogden.  <blockquote>\"Neither the rejecting object nor the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego) is willing or able to think about, much less relinquish, that tie. In fact, there is no desire on the part of either to change anything about their mutual dependence. The power of that bond is impossible to overestimate. The rejecting object and the internal saboteur are determined to nurse their feelings of having been deeply wronged, cheated, humiliated, betrayed, exploited, treated unfairly, discriminated against, and so on. The mistreatment at the hands of the other is felt to be unforgivable. An apology is forever expected by each, but never offered by either\" (Odgen,,2010,p.109)<ref>{{Citation|last=Ogden|first=Thomas H.|title=The International Journal of Psychoanalysis|date=2010|volume=91|pages=101-118|chapter=|publisher=|doi=|isbn=978-0-429-47453-8}}</ref></blockquote>Fairbairn's first quote on source of resistance that he discussed in the 1943 paper, about the de-repression of internalized objects creating a frightening world \"peopled with  devils\", he mentioned \"another factor\" which created resistance, which he discussed in his 1944 paper. This second factor is the intense attachment between the libidinal ego and its exciting object, which is an attachment that is fueled by need and unfulfilled desire.The libidinal ego of  the neglected child lives in a world of hopeful fantasies and he/she cannot give up hope in their parents because his/her entire world would crash down upon them if he/she were to accept that indeed, there was no hope. <blockquote>There can be no room for doubt that the obstinate attachment of the libidinal ego to the exciting object and its reluctance to renounce this object constitute a particularly formidable source of resistance -and one which plays no small part in determining what is known as the as the negative therapeutic reaction...The truth is that, however well the fact may be disguised, the individual is extremely reluctant to abandon his original hate, no less than his original need of his original objects in childhood (Fairbairn, 1952,p.117)<ref name=\":2\" />.</blockquote>Fairbairn uses the concept of \"Negative Therapeutic Reaction\" in this quote, which  is defined as a hostile reaction by a patient to treatment regardless of the skill or experience of the therapist. Patient's who are deeply involved in their inner world, and who are re-fighting all the battles of their childhood, will tolerate no interference of their  ongoing battles and will  experience the therapist as an unwelcome intruder. These two quotes demonstrate that  '''resistance to change is fueled by both sub-egos in the inner world.''' The antilibidinal ego does not want to give up its quest to reform the rejecting object's view of him, while the libidinal ego refuses to give up on the fantasy that there is still some hidden love in his objects. Clinically, if the inexperienced  therapist insists at the outset of treatment that the patient separate from his/her parents and live on their own, he/she might precipitate an abandonment crisis that may endanger further treatment. The patient needs a secure attachment to an external object before any of these internal ties can be given up. Once again, Fairbairn's model is consistent and logical in that the original source of psychopathology is the internalization of bad objects. Once internalized,  the original motives of the sub egos as they struggle with the two internalized objects, continues to operate in the inner world. When this factor is combined with the earlier description of resistance as coming from the patients fear of the powerful emotions associated with the de-repression of internalized bad objects, coupled with the emotional loss of all of his fantasies about belonging to a family, resistance becomes completely understandable within this model.\n\n==== The Variable Strength of the Ego Structures ====\nFairbairn's  structural model is the beginning stage of a multiple personality, however '''it never develops beyond this steady state.''' As described, the central ego develops in relationship to the supportive and nurturing parent(s), the Ideal Object(s). The strength and size of the Central Ego '''varies from child to child''' according to how many positive, ego enhancing activities and interpersonal events they have experienced with their parents during the course of  their development. Fairbairn's model assumes that actual events in the external world are internalized and  summate in both the conscious central ego and in the unconscious structures as well. Thus large numbers of loving, non-intrusive, and emotionally supportive interactions with the parent(s) enhance the child's central ego through daily positive relating. As the child develops over time his trust in others allows him to interact with peers  and adults and he is able to develop new skills, as well as enlarge a more complex view of himself through interactions with others who see aspects of himself that his parents have not discovered. \n\nIn less favorable developmental conditions, where support, nurturance and reassurance is scarce or absent, the child's central ego does not develop a richer and more rounded sense of self, rather the  development of his central ego is thwarted rather than enhanced. Its focus is a finely attuned search for any positive, supportive responses from his parents. At the same time, his many negative experiences are being dissociated and repressed, and his central ego loses sight of the many important (but negative) events in his childhood, which are banished (and remain) in his unconscious structures.  '''The ratio of''' '''conscious to unconscious structures''' shifts away from conscious relationships with external objects to the child's powerful and richly populated unconscious, with the endless bickering between the antilibidinal ego and the rejecting object, and the unrealistic fantasy world of the libidinal ego. A powerful unconscious that is filled with constant dialogues influences the weakened central ego which interprets all of reality in terms of the rigid role-relationships that are active in his unconscious. These internal templates cloud reality and become the source of both transference and repetition compulsions.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory In the Clinical Setting|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=New York|pages=51\u201371}}</ref>\n\n==== A Structural Analysis of the Effects of Treatment ====\nFairbairn's 1944 paper also gave a brief description the impact  of psychotherapy or psychoanalysis on  the patient's interior world. In the following quote, Fairbairn speaks of \"territories\", which is his physical metaphor for the size of the internal structures. He sees the effects of psychotherapy as decreasing the two sub-egos because the central ego develops strength due to its  acceptance of the therapist as a good and reliable object, and it can now tolerate some or most of the painful realities of his/her childhood.<blockquote>I conceive it as one of the chief aims of psychoanalytical therapy to introduce some change into its topography by way of territorial adjustment. Thus I conceive it as among the most important functions of psychoanalytical therapy (a) to reduce the split of the original ego by restoring to the central ego a maximum of the territories ceded to the libidinal ego and the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego), and (b) to bring the exciting object and the rejecting object so far as possible together within the sphere and influence of the central ego (Fairbairn, 1952,p.129-130)<ref name=\":2\" />.</blockquote>Fairbairn was pessimistic regarding the extent that psychotherapy could modify the patient's unconscious in this (1944 paper), however his later papers were far more optimistic. Fairbairn viewed psychopathology as the splitting off of parts of the central ego that were were intolerable to accept  and were dissociated and held in the unconscious. In the process, the central ego loses parts of itself, as well as memories  off the reality of his childhood. In addition, the diminished central ego is easily influenced by the unconscious split off beliefs and assumptions of the sub egos, which  can suddenly repress the central ego and become the conscious executive ego for a period of time. This makes  the individual appear erratic (which indeed they are) and causes others with whom they relate to abandon them as they are so changeable and unreliable. Fairbairn saw treatment as gradually allowing the central ego to grow as it learns of, and accepts the truth of what happened to him/her  as a child. The pain and anger of the antilibidinal ego will now make sense to the central ego given that the patient can now access more memories of the rejecting parents. Secondly, his libidinal ego will lose some of its territory, to use Fairbairns metaphor, as the patient's illusions about his parents are scrutinized. His/her fantasy based illusions are based on he libidinal ego not-knowing just how bad the rejecting object once was. With treatment, the central ego can now accept  the reality of the rejecting parents . Given this knowledge, there is no place for an illusory fantasy about the the parents assumed  goodness.    \n\n'''Transference and  Repetition Compulsions'''\n\nWhen any individual superimposes or projects his inner structures on an external object (for instance, his rejecting object) then he is going to misperceive that individual's intentions and behavior, and relate to him in a passive-aggressive and hostile manner. Thus projection of the inner structures onto external objects becomes the source of transference.  This occurs in individuals who have richly suffused unconscious structures which easily override the perceptions of the central ego.<br />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.columbia.edu/~rr322/FAIRBAIRN.html 'Fairbairn's Structural Model'], Richard L.

''Psychoanalytic Studies of Personality'', a 1952 collection of Fairbairn's papers previously published in various psychoanalytic journals, includes four papers that contain most of his innovative concepts. \n\nFairbairn's model is  classified as a psychoanalytic model or theory because it shares the common assumption of all psychoanalytic models\u2014the belief that the fundamental source of human motivation originates in the unconscious\u2014as well as offering explanations of the origins and dynamics of transference, repetition compulsions, and resistance. His enormously ambitious goal was to replace Freudian [[metapsychology]] with his own. Fairbairn's vision of the human psyche was not based on the Freudian notion that the infant is overflowing with primitive drives needing to be tamed, but rather that the infant is seeking love and emotional attachment that can infuse him with the security he needs to explore the world, safe in the knowledge that he has parents ready to help him if he becomes overwhelmed in that exploration. Fairbairn's model offers a different theory of psychological development, a completely new vision of the structure and dynamics of the personality, a different source of the origins of psychopathology, and a different approach to the treatment of disordered individuals. Fairbairn's model also shifts the focus away from repression (of the Id's forbidden desires) and back to dissociation as humans' fundamental defense mechanism. \n\nGreenberg and Mitchell noted the basic changes promoted by Fairbairn:  \n<blockquote>\nIn a series of dense and fertile papers written during the early 1940's, W.R.D. Fairbairn developed a theoretical perspective which, along with Sullivan's \"interpersonal psychiatry\", provides the purest and clearest expression of the shift from the drive/structure model to the relational/structure model (Greenberg and Mitchell, 1983:151).<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Greenberg and Mitchell|first=Jay  and Stephen|title=Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-62975-2|location=|pages=151}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe psychoanalytic model Freud offers is a '''drive/structure model''': it proposes that human beings are born with innate, biological drives (e.g., sexual desire and aggression) contained in the unconscious Id. The infant's Id seeks discharge of its tensions regardless of the situation. When the discharging drive (hitting, biting, urinating, defecating) comes into contact with the demands and prohibitions of society, there is immediate conflict. A new structure must emerge from the Id of the growing infant to insure that its drives are expressed in a socially acceptable way. Thus the unconscious Id\u2014Freud's metaphor for the whole range and strength of biological drives\u2014is forced to develop contact with reality through the emergence of a second structure: the Ego. Thus the Ego has the task of mediating between the primitive Id and society. Later on in development (via the Oedipal Conflict), the child internalizes the values of his parents. These internalized values become the third internal structure, which is called the Super Ego. These three hypothetical ego structures\u2014Id, Ego, and Super Ego\u2014mature and grow with experience. Freud postulated that all psychological development is based on the Id seeking satisfaction, the Ego curbing the Id's most extreme demands, and the Super Ego pressing the Ego to make morally correct choices. \n\nIn contrast, Fairbairn's is a '''relational/structure model''' in its assumption that the human psyche develops its structure from actual human experience, not from pressure from the Id, whose existence Fairbairn rejects. Instead, Fairbairn proposes that the human psyche develops structures based on actual interpersonal events. A child's growing and maturing internal ego structures can be understood as packages of memories that coalesce and form internal representations of the parents, of the child himself, and of the child's relationship to his parents. For Fairbairn, the unconscious develops as a consequence of empathic failures of the parents that are too disruptive for the child's underdeveloped central ego to tolerate. Awareness of these failures would interfere with the child's absolute dependency on his parents, and knowledge of them would destroy the necessary illusion that he is loved and cherished. In families where punishment is frequent and severe, parental failures can be catastrophic to the child's developing sense of self. That is, the child can be so overwhelmed by parental aggression that it faces the loss of its sense of self, as described by Bromberg:     <blockquote>\nPsychological trauma occurs in situations, explicitly or implicitly interpersonal, in which self-invalidation (sometimes self-annihilation) cannot be escaped from or prevented, and from which there is no hope of protection, relief, or soothing. If the experience is either prolonged, [sic] assaultively violent, or if self-development is weak or immature, then the level of affective arousal is too great for the event to be experienced self-reflectively and given meaning through cognitive processing. \u2026 At its extreme, the subjective experience is that of a chaotic and terrifying flooding of affect that threatens to overwhelm sanity and psychological survival (Bromberg, 1998, 12).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bromberg|first=Philip|title=Standing in The Spaces: Essays on Clinical Process, Trauma and Dissociation|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=0-88163-356-9|location=|pages=12}}</ref>     \n</blockquote>\nOver time, these dissociated events, including those in which the child's sense of self was endangered, become ego structures in the individual's internal world. (See the following section on splitting of the ego for a detailed explanation of this process.) Thus the human psyche acquires structure from the tensions of split-off traumas so toxic they remain unavailable to the individual's central ego. Therefore, the unconscious is not a biological inheritance of humankind but a development of specific parental failures and interpersonal traumas that were dissociated because they were too disruptive to remember.\n\n===='Schizoid Factors in the Personality' (1940)====\n\nIn his first paper, Fairbairn observed that many of his patients seemed \"schizoid\", which he defined as any individual who showed evidence of  having '''splits in their ego structure''' directly resulting from dissociated memories in their central ego. (Today we would call these patients Personality Disordered.) The dissociated packages of memories are held in the unconscious, \"split-off\" from the conscious central ego which no longer knows that they exist. Thus, many reality-based traumas are no longer known to the individual, who becomes withdrawn for interpersonal interactions. Fairbairn defined the schizoid as having the three following characteristics: <blockquote>\n\u2026 (1) an attitude of omnipotence, (2) an attitude of isolation and detachment and, (3) a preoccupation with inner reality.\u2026 So as far as the preoccupation with inner reality is concerned, this is undoubtedly the most important of all schizoid characteristics; and it is not the less present whether inner reality be substituted for outer reality, identified with outer reality, or superimposed upon outer reality (Fairbairn, 1952, p:6-7).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Fairbairn|first=William Ronald Dodds|title=Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=0-7100-1361-2|location=London|pages=}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe more frequently a child encounters intolerable trauma, the larger the number of memories of actual lived experiences that are split off and unavailable to the conscious \"central ego\". The schizoid style of relating (or more accurately, non-relating) to others originates from repeated rejections of the child's legitimate need for love and emotional support during his developmental years. The schizoid child was raised by a mother who was unable to relate to her child with tender, loving emotions, and as a direct consequence of this rejection, the child withdraws into his inner world, which, though safer, is ultimately less satisfying. Fairbairn spells this out starkly:\n<blockquote>\nRegressive reinstatement of the early oral attitude (the earliest form of dependency) would appear to be most readily brought about by a situation of emotional frustration in which the child comes to feel (a) that he is not really loved for himself as a person by his mother, and (b) that his own love for his mother is not really valued and accepted by her. This is a highly traumatic situation, giving rise to a further situation characterized as follows: (a) the child comes to regard his mother as a Bad Object in so far as she does not seem to love him, (b) The child comes to regard outward expressions of his own love as bad, with the result that ... he tends to retain his love inside of himself. (c) The child comes to feel that love relationships with external objects in general are bad, or at least precarious (Fairbairn, 1952:17-18).<ref name=\":2\" /> \n</blockquote>\nFairbairn recognized that lack of love in a young child's life is traumatic and disruptive to his attachment. In his later papers (1943 &1944),he observed that the child protected himself from remembering these traumatic events by using  the dissociative defense to erase them form his conscious memory. \n\nTypically, Fairbairn returned again and again to topics that he had discussed in his early papers as he was gradually expanding his observations while creating a coherent model. For example, in a quote from his 1941 paper on the schizoid personality style, Fairbairn observes that the unloved child feels his love is destructive because his parents do not value or accept it, and because they do not return his love. Thus the child '''blames himself''' for not being lovable, which deflects the blame from his unloving parents on to himself. By blaming himself, he continues the illusion that he has loving parents that reject him for a good reason, i.e., that he and his love are toxic. This theme will come up again in the 1943 paper when Fairbairn described \"The Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\" a cognitive defense in which the child blames himself for the parental failures. In the next quote, Fairbairn uses the Freudian concept of 'libido', which was defined as the mix of sex and aggression in the Id. Fairbairn was forced to use the preexisting language of psychoanalysis, however he took the word \"libido\" and changed it to mean a child's love for his parents or love of other external objects:<blockquote>\nIt is the great tragedy of the schizoid individual that his love seems to destroy: and it is because his love seems so destructive that he experiences such difficulty in directing libido toward objects in outer reality. He becomes afraid to love: and therefore he erects barriers between his objects and himself. He tends to both keep his objects at a distance and to make himself remote from them. He rejects his objects: and at the same time he withdraws libido from them. This withdrawal of libido may be carried to all lengths. It may be carried to a point at which all emotional and physical contacts with other persons are renounced; and it may even go so far that all libidinal links with outer reality are surrendered, all interest in the world around fades and everything becomes meaningless. In proportion as libido is withdrawn from outer objects it is directed toward internalized objects: and in proportion as this happens the person becomes introverted (Fairbairn 1952, p.50)<ref name=\":2\" />.    \n</blockquote>\nSimply put, the unloved child who has directed his love toward his parents, only to be rebuffed, gives up hope that he will ever be loved, and as a consequence holds his love inside. He gives up on human relationships, focusing instead on his inner world and its fantasies and dreams of success.\n\n===='A Revised Psychopathology of the Psychoses and Psychoneuroses  (1941)'====\nFairbairn was gradually forming his model in these first papers. He  challenged Freud's drive theory directly in this second paper by  stating \"Nevertheless, it would appear as if the point had now been reached at which, in the interest of progress, the classical libido theory would have to be transformed into ''a theory of development based essentially upon object-relationships,'' Fairbairn (1952,p,31).<ref name=\":2\" />  Unfortunately, the shift in focus from drive theory to object relations theory was far too great for the psychoanalytic community to accept, because Freud's entire model was based on the existence and activity of libidinal drives. All of psychoanalysis was Freudian in the 1940s, there were no other options, and yet Fairbairn asked his colleagues to choose between his model and Freud's. They overwhelming chose Freud. From this point on, his model was seen as an \"interesting\" philosophical and intellectual exercise, rather than as a viable analytic model that would, over time, become one of the foundational models of \"Relational Psychoanalysis\" of simply \"Relationality\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Stephen|title=Relationality: From Attachment to Intersubjectivity|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=2000|isbn=0-88163-322-4|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell, Stephen & Aron, Lewis|first=|title=Relational Psychoanalysis: The Emergence of a Tradition|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=1999|isbn=0-88163-270-8|location=|pages=}}</ref>.\nFairbairn proposed an outline of a developmental model in this chapter as well. He noted that human development was characterized by a gradual differentiation (separation both physically and psychologically) from the parent because of the emergence  of a mature, reality based, central ego in the young adult. This allows the young adult to begin life on his own, find a partner and produce the next generation.<blockquote>The development of object-relationships is essentially a process whereby infantile dependence upon the object gradually gives place to mature dependence upon the object. The process of development is characterized (a) by the gradual abandonment of an original object relationship based on primary identification, and (b) the gradual adoption of an object-relationship based upon differentiation of the object (Fairbairn, 1952, p.34)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the development proceeds, the child gradually realizes that he is not part of his mother, but rather is an independent, fully functioning person. Unfortunately, many children are not supported and loved sufficiently to go through the \"transitional\" stage easily. They do not feel  secure and cannot engage in age appropriate activity with their peers. Instead, they are looking backwards toward their mother for more support, rather than toward the outside world of other children and healthy play. Fairbairn noted this in one of his most famous quotes:<blockquote>\nThe greatest need of a child is to obtain conclusive assurance (a) that he is genuinely loved as a person by his parents, and (b) that his parents genuinely accept his love. It is only in so far as such assurance is forthcoming in a form sufficiently convincing to enable him to depend safely upon his real objects (parents) that he is able to gradually renounce infantile dependence without misgiving. In the absence of such assurance his relationships to his objects is fraught with too much anxiety over separation to enable him to renounce the attitude of infantile dependence: for such a renunciation would be equivalent in his eyes to forfeiting all hope of ever obtaining the satisfaction of his unsatisfied emotional needs. '''Frustration of his desire to be loved as a person, and frustration of his desire to have his love accepted, is the greatest trauma that a child can experience''' (Fairbairn, 1952, p.39-40)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the dependent child cannot mature and go on to the next developmental step as he is fearful of increased separation from his parents without being sure of their love and support. The loved child does receive support and encouragement which gives him enough courage to let them go, and establish new relationships with peers and future partners. The child who is unsure of his parents' love remains emotionally underdeveloped, and often remains at home, trying to obtain the love that was not forthcoming in his developmental history (Celani, 2005)<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=Leaving Home|publisher=Columbia Universities Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13477-4|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>.  \n\nThe unloved child attempts to avoid further emotional rebuffs  by becoming increasingly \"schizoid\". That is, he turns away from the harsh and unloving world of his family and towards his internalized memories of others, including his parents, for reassurance that they are with him and available at all times. Unfortunately, most of his internalized memories are negative (see the relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object in the Splitting section). Despite the negativity, the endless struggle between these internalized split off part self and part object provides the comfort of the known and familiar. Clearly, this is a half measure, but it is the best that the ignored or rejected child can do under the circumstances, as he cannot change his parents or force them to love him.   \n\nSecondly, the rejected child comforts himself with \"substitutive satisfactions\"  which Fairbairn assumed were forms of immature sexuality. Today, the unloved, schizoid child has only to turn to the internet for an endless number of fantasy based videos that compensate him for his lack of love, lack of power,  and his desire for revenge, which temporarily lessens his pain. Fairbairn was clear about this regressive return to the inner world because of the harshness of the external world: \"Fundamentally, these substitutive satisfactions ...all represent ''relationships with internalized objects, to which the individual is compelled to turn in default of satisfactory relationships with objects in the outer world\"(Italics in the original) Fairbairn, 1952, p.40)''<ref name=\":2\" />. This observation of Fairbairn's has been validated by the millions of alienated and unloved children who spend hour upon hour avoiding interactions with external reality, including their family members, while immersed in their video fantasy world. This is the most satisfaction that they can get from their lives, as their relationships with their parents are so frustrating. \n\nFairbairn also discussed the difficulties in separating from unloving parents in this 1941 paper. He recognized that the lack of early support left the child with very few emotional resources to sustain himself when he left home and faced the world alone. He called the stage between \"infantile dependence\" and \"mature interdependence' the stage of \"Transition\".<blockquote>The great conflict of the transition stage may now be formulated as a conflict between a progressive urge to surrender the infantile attitude of identification with the object and a regressive urge to maintain that attitude. During this period, accordingly, the behavior of the individual is characterized both by desperate endeavors on his part to separate from the object and desperate endeavors to achieve reunion with the object-desperate attempts \"to escape from prison' and desperate attempts \"to return home\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.43).<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>The less the child has been supported in his early years, the less chance he/she has of a successful transition into adulthood. The huge number of \"adult\" aged individuals who either live at home with their aging parents, or others who live separately, but remain fixated in an adolescent time warp, is enormous. In either case, they have been unable to enter mature relationships because they are still seeking the support and encouragement that they missed out on in childhood <ref name=\":5\" />.   \n\n===='The Repression and the Return of Bad Objects (1943)' ====\nFairbairn's third theoretical paper further alienated those few members of the analytic community who found his work acceptable as he had the temerity to once again urge the replacement of drive theory with his object relations theory.<blockquote>Amongst the conclusions formulated in the above mentioned paper (his 1941 paper) two of the most far reaching are the following:(1) that libidinal \"aims\" are of secondary importance in comparison with object-relationships and (2) that a relationship with the object, and not gratification of the impulse, is the ultimate aim of libidinal striving (Fairbairn, 1952, p.60)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>Later on, in the same paper, Fairbairn added another comment that further alienated his analytic colleagues:  <blockquote>A point has now been reached at which the theory (Freud's Libido theory) has outworn its usefulness and, so far from providing impetus for further progress within the field of psychoanalytical thought, is actually operating as a brake upon the wheels (Fairbairn, 1952, p.72)<ref name=\":2\" />  </blockquote>This is '''not''' what the analytic community was looking for in 1943, as Fairbairn reduced Freud's concept of Libido to a secondary position as he described his unique  vision of the child's motivation. He saw that all children sought out  good objects, in the hope of establishing  a loving  relationship with another human being. He then formally re-defined the human unconscious, not as a container of biological drives, but rather a compendium of memories of interpersonal events that were too destructive to the child's needed attachment to his parents for his developing ego to accept. Fairbairn's \"challenge\" of the Freudian model did not pose a problem for the analytic community, despite the fact that Fairbairn's unconscious was so different from the \"standard\" Freudian view, simply because his model was politely ignored for forty years until 1983, until the publication of Greenberg and Mitchell's book \"Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory\",<ref name=\":6\" />. This alerted the younger members of the psychoanalytic community about Fairbairn's theory of psychoanalysis, and the renewed interest provoked numerous publications.  <blockquote>I now venture to formulate the view that what are primarily repressed are neither intolerably guilty impulses nor intolerably unpleasant memories, but intolerably bad internalized objects. If memories are repressed, accordingly, this is only because the objects involved in such memories are identified with bad internalized objects (Fairbairn, 1952,p.62)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>This assertion by Fairbairn: that the unconscious is composed of dissociated memories of parental failures was simply too much for the analytic community to bear. He dismissed Freud's notion of an unconscious populated by biological forces that were seen to be (at that time)  the fundamental motivator of humankind. In Fairbairn's model, the dissociated memories  in the unconscious resonate throughout the individual's life. Note that Fairbairn was ahead of himself in this quote because  he had not yet defined a \"'''bad object'''\", which is a parent or guardian that the child looks to for love, help, guidance, and support, and who fails the child again and again. Also note that Fairbairn uses the word '''repressed''' rather than '''dissociated''' in this quote. Repression is used to describe the psychological defense of holding of material in the unconscious that is already present. Dissociation describes the psychological act of actively \"forgetting\" an overwhelmingly traumatic event that occurred in the external world, and instantaneously forcing it into the unconscious. Once the memory of the event is there it is held out of awareness by repression.           \n\nFairbairn also offered a clear pathway from dissociated memories of neglect and abuse to adult psychopathology in the following passage.  <blockquote>Whether any given individual becomes delinquent, psychoneurotic, psychotic or simply \"normal\" would appear to depend in the main upon the operation of three factors: (1) the extent to which bad objects have been installed in the unconscious, and the degree of badness by which they are characterized, (2) the extent to which the ego is identified with internalized bad objects, and (3) the nature and strength of the defenses which protect the ego from these objects (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>The child who is so unfortunate to be born in a family where the parents are absent, indifferent or abusive is going to experience and internalize a huge number of bad object interactions. These dissociated memories coalesce and form large and powerful inner structures that will influence his view of himself and his perception of external reality. The second point in the quote describes how the individual's identification with the abuser can exacerbate the impact of the dissociated memories. For instance a boy who sees his father beat his mother may identify with this behavior and then re-enact this pattern in his adulthood. Conversely a female child might dis-identify with her father and, in adulthood, support abused women. The third factor, \"Defensiveness\" is also significant as the highly defended individual will remember little or nothing of the traumas he/she experienced in childhood. As a consequence, these individuals  have a greater probability of re-enacting one role or the other (the abuser of the victim) because they  have no ability to \"mentalize\", or think about and  process the traumatic events of their childhood. Thus, the highly defended individual will never comprehend what happened to them, and realize how their early history  influenced their adulthood. Instead, the internalized patterns will re-emerge and be acted out with the next generation. This is called the \"intergenerational transmission of trauma\".                  \n\nFairbairn also noticed that children who had been removed from their families because of extreme neglect or abuse (this was in Scotland during the 1930's) made endless excuses for their parents and assumed that they themselves were responsible for the treatment that they were receiving. That is, their parents were punishing them because they were dirty, disobedient, or lazy. The child assumed that he/she was the cause of the parent's hostile behavior toward them. Fairbairn called this the '''\"Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\"'''. Once again the child is desperate to support his illusion that he/she is living within a loving family, and that he/she is the cause of the strife.         <blockquote>It becomes obvious, therefore, that the child would rather be bad himself than have bad objects: and accordingly we have some justification for surmising that one of his motives in becoming bad is to make his objects \"good\". In becoming bad he is really taking upon himself the burden of badness which appears to reside in his objects. By this means he seeks to purge them of his badness: and in proportion as he succeeds in doing so, he is rewarded by that sense of security which an environment of good objects so characteristically confers....Outer security is thus purchased at the price of inner insecurity (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>This defense is a cognitive defense in that the child is using logic to explain to himself why he is being punished or neglected. By saying it is his fault, he absolves his parents and gives them a \"good\" reason for treating him badly. As Fairbairn notes, it continues the pattern used by children to support the illusion that they are living in a loving family. The child prefers to believe that he has a \"moral\" defect, such as being lazy, disrespectful, or being chronically dirty, all of which are potentially correctable, than see that his parents are emotionally bankrupt and indifferent to his welfare. Worse, the defensive self blame erodes what little self worth the child may have developed. This defense is really a precursor to the splitting defense that Fairbairn described in his next paper (1944), in that it is a primitive form of splitting in that the parental objects are \"all good\", and the child himself is \"all bad\". Fairbairn never went back to his earlier concepts, like the moral defense, and updated them to fit in with his evolving thought.                 \n\nThen Fairbairn returned to his earlier discussion, that he had begun in his 1940 and 1941 papers, on different aspects of the child's dependency on his objects. These concepts would have been more appropriate in his earlier papers where he first discussed the issue of dependency. However, the reader is given an opportunity to actually see how a major innovator of a psychoanalytic theory gradually creates a model. His mind was not linear, and many topics came to mind again and again, dependency being the most frequent topic. Here he observes the intense need of the child for his parents and the child's inability to reject them, regardless of how badly he/she was being treated:        <blockquote>The child not only internalizes his bad objects because they force themselves upon him and he seeks to control them, but also, and above all, because he ''needs'' them. If a child's parents are bad objects, he cannot eject them, even if they do not force themselves upon him: for he cannot do without them. '''Even if they neglect him, he cannot reject them: for if they neglect him, his need for them is increased''' (Fairbairn, 1952,p.67)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>Fairbairn made this revolutionary observation and, at the time, it went unnoticed. The '''neglected child needs the parent more, rather than less''' because the individual's earlier needs were never fulfilled, and they do not suddenly disappear or resolve themselves. This observation seems counter-intuitive when seen from an adult perspective, because a mature individual would leave a hostile or unloving interpersonal situation in a minute.  However, the reality of many  young adults from neglectful families is that their own unmet dependency needs pressure them to remain with their abusive parents.They may have unmet needs from age 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (and so on) that were  never met, so as a young adult this individual has '''no possibility whatsoever of separating''' from his neglectful parents, and beginning a life of his own. This was one of Fairbairn's great insights which can be seen in virtually all young patients.                                                                                \n\nFairbairn then took up new topics in the same wide-ranging paper- which is one of his two greatest (the second being his 1944 paper, which will be described in the next section). The two topics were (1) his theory of treatment and (2) his view of resistance. Most of his work focuses on the Bad Object, and the many psychological problems it fostered. In this section of the paper he begins to think about the effects of a '''Good Object-''' one that fulfills the promise of being nurturant, loving, and supportive. As mentioned earlier, Fairbairn's model is symmetrical, in that good objects which are available and conscious (and which ideally should be present in every child's life) have the opposite effect as compared to bad objects. Here he notes that they can actually cure or at least mitigate, the effects of internalized bad objects.                 <blockquote>Nevertheless, I cannot help feeling that such results must be attributed, in part at least, to the fact that in the transference situation the patient is provided in reality with an unwontedly good object, and is thereby placed in a position to risk a release of his internalized bad objects from the unconscious and so to provide conditions for the libidinal cathexis of these objects to be dissolved--albeit he is also under a temptation to exploit a \"good\" relationship with the analyst, as a defense against taking this risk (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69).<ref name=\":2\" />                  </blockquote>Fairbairn identifies one of the key mutative factors in psychotherapy as the \"good relationship\" between the therapist and patient. The influence of a good object therapist should provoke a derepression (a release from the unconscious) of the memories of abuse and neglect that were previously unavailable to his conscious central ego. He sees the relationship between patient and therapist as providing the patient with enough confidence and support to allow him to \"remember\" what actually happened to him, as he has a new object upon whom he can depend. He  uses the word \"libidinal cathexis\" in his quote which is a holdover from the Freudian model. It means emotional investment of libidinal energy in the other person, which when translated into Fairbairn's terminology, means emotional attachment. Thus a relationship with a new, good object can loosen up the attachment to an internalized bad object, as the good object offers the patient an alternative attachment. In reality, this process seldom happens until treatment is well underway,  At the outset of treatment most patients stubbornly cling to their  illusions that they were raised in a loving and supportive family as well as to the illusion that they are somehow defective and deserving of neglect or abuse.\n\nThe 1943  paper's title \"Repression and the Return of Bad Objects\" suggests that Fairbairn was going to address the reemergence of bad objects, which he does in a  comment on one of the fundamental sources of '''Resistance.''' Resistance describes the patient's attempts to remain the same and fight against the therapist's interventions during the process of psychotherapy, despite their conscious desire to change. As previously noted, Fairbairn's model is coherent, and given that the source of psychopathology is the internalization of bad objects because they were intolerable to accept, resistance comes from the patient's fear of acknowledging and accepting what happened to him in childhood despite the fact that these events occurred decades ago. This is true even if the parents are long deceased, because for the patient to accept what they did to him/her as a child will, in most cases, destroy all his illusions about them as parents and the \"goodness\" of his childhood. It also leaves the individual without a personal history, as he has to give up all his fantasies of being a member of a family and instead, see himself as an unloved and discarded child. For a detailed description of how to manage patient resistance during the process of treatment see Celani, 2010 (pp,117-184)<ref name=\":4\" />. \n\nFairbairn's quote on resistance is graphic and to the point.<blockquote>There is little doubt in my mind that, in conjunction with another factor to be mentioned later, the deepest source of resistance is fear of the release of bad objects from the unconscious: for when such bad objects are released, the world around the patient becomes '''peopled with devils which are too terrifying for him to face'''...At the same time there is now little doubt in my mind that the release of bad objects from the unconscious is one of the chief aims which the psychotherapist should set himself out to achieve, even at the expense of a severe \"transference neurosis\": for it is only when the internalized bad objects are released from the unconscious that there is any hope of their cathexis being dissolved. The bad objects can only be safely released, however, if the analyst has become established as a sufficiently good object for the patient. Otherwise the resulting insecurity may prove insupportable (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69-70)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>Fairbairn's clinical observation regarding the difficulty for patients to actually reexamine and tolerate the events that they '''had already suffered through,''' is absolutely correct. Exposure of the patient to the realities of his childhood can only be successfully managed when the patient is securely attached to the therapist as a good object, and thus will not feel abandoned when the illusions about his parents fall away. Fairbairn was both a philosopher and an advanced divinity student before becoming a physician and psychoanalyst, and often his language involves devils and angels, as it does in this quote. Later on the next page he ends his comment on resistance with the statement: \"It becomes evident, accordingly, that the psychotherapist is the true successor to the exorcist, and that he is concerned, not only with \"the forgiveness of sins\", but also with \"the casting out of devils\"\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.70).<ref name=\":2\" />\n<br />\n\n=== Endopsychic Structure Considered in terms of Object Relationships (1944) ===\n{{Main|Splitting of the Ego}}\nFairbairn, as mentioned, was continually amplifying and refining his observations regarding children's dependency on their parents. This was also true for his 1944 paper, which contains a detailed description of the impossible dilemma that the rejected child faces. Here, he highlights the crushing emotionality experienced by the child when his needs are rejected, and the impossibly  frustrating position he is forced into, one in which he cannot complain about his rejection for fear of increased rejection while simultaneously he cannot express his love or his need. The following quote demonstrates Fairbairn's writing at its best along with his unparalleled sensitivity to children's needs.   <blockquote>From the latter standpoint, what he experiences is a sense of lack of love, and indeed of emotional ''rejection'' on his mother's part. This being so, the expression of hate toward her as a rejecting object becomes in his eyes a very dangerous procedure. On the one hand, it is calculated to make her reject him all the more, and thus increase her badness and make her seem ''more real'' in her capacity as a bad object. On the other hand it is calculated to make her love him less, and thus to decrease her \"goodness' and make her seem ''less real'' (ie: destroy her) in her capacity of a good object. At the same time it also becomes a dangerous procedure for the child to express his libidinal need , i.e.his nascent love, of his mother in the face of rejection at her hands...In an older child this experience (showing love to a parent and having it rejected) is one of intense humiliation over the depreciation of his love, which seems to be involved. At a somewhat deeper level, or at an earlier stage, the experience is one of shame over the display of needs which are disregarded or belittled. In virtue of these experiences of humiliation and shame he feels reduced to a state of '''worthlessness,''' '''destitution''' or '''beggardom'''. His sense of his own value is threatened: and he feels bad in the sense of \"inferior (Fairbairn, 1952,pp.112-113)<ref name=\":2\" />   </blockquote>Thus the child can neither complain about his treatment for fear that he will be treated even more horribly, nor does he dare to offer his love to a parent who might reject and belittle him, as he has experienced in the past. The child has no where to go and no one from whom he can seek help or appeal to, which is the position that millions of children are caught in at any given moment in time. Fairbairn gained his many insights to the plight of children from his work in the orphanage attached to the hospital in Edinburgh in which he worked (1927-1935)<ref name=\":7\" />, and he never forgot those experiences. \n\n==== An Outline of Fairbairn's Structural Model ====\nFairbairn's 1944 paper introduced the psychoanalytic community to his alternative view of the structure of the human personality which he saw as being the result of dissociation of intolerably frustrating experiences with the individuals parents. Before he introduced his model he commented on the ability of one structure (or sub-self) to repress another sub-self, and in so doing, become the executive (dominant) ego structure.<blockquote>It is not inconceivable that one part of the \"ego\" with a dynamic charge should repress another part of the \"ego\" with a dynamic charge..In order to account for repression, we thus appear to be driven to the necessity of assuming a certain multiplicity of egos (Fairbairn, 1952, p.90)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>The ability of one ego state to repress another ego state is the central dynamic of the unconscious in Fairbairn's model. It accounts for the shifting of ego states that can occur when dissociated material has been de-repressed and temporarily is \"known\" to the central ego has to be suddenly forced out of awareness and replaced by another view of reality. His model sees psychopathology as an endless series of shifting ego states which protect the individual from the harsh realities of their childhood, but simultaneously, disrupts their life because of the incomplete views of themselves and the incomplete views of people around them.     \n\nFairbairn's 1944  structural theory emerged from his careful and detailed analysis of a patient's dream (Fairbairn, 1952, pp.95-106)<ref name=\":2\" />. He observed that the patient had separate views of herself and of her significant others that could be understood as part-selves and part objects. Fairbairn saw that there were three pairs of structures- one pair was conscious and the other two pairs were largely unconscious.The fundamental position of Object Relations Theory is that for every developing self there has to be a object to whom it relates, thus every pair of structures contains a version of self paired with a version of the object (other person) to whom the self structure was relating. The two conscious structures are the  '''The Central Ego''' (the self structure) and its relationship to the '''Ideal Object''' (the other) , and '''two pairs of unconscious structures.''' The first pair of (mostly unconscious structures) are  '''The Antilibidinal Ego''' (the self structure, which Fairbairn originally called the \"internal saboteur\") is an internal  representation of the neglected, humiliated and enraged child in a relationship to the '''Rejecting Object''', (the object structure) which is an internal representation of the abusive parent. The second pair of unconscious structures are  '''The Libidinal Ego''' (the self structure) which is the child's fantasy of the good parent whom he wishes for and his relationship to the '''Exciting Object''' (the object structure) which is a fantasy representation of the loving parent who offers him hope for the future. In extremely negative families there are so few supportive, positive interactions with the parents that the child is forced, by necessity to create hope for himself by developing a second set of views of himself in relationship to his parent. In Fairbairn's model '''the need of the child for a positive parent is so intense that the deprived child creates a \"good\" parent''' out of fantasy and hope.  This  second vision of the parent (mis)perceives the parent as filled with the potential of love. This vision of the parent is built out of the occasional positive or tender interaction that the child has experienced with his mostly rejecting parents.  The attachments of these  two mostly unconscious selves to these part objects constitutes what Fairbairn defined as an attachment to the '''Bad Object'''.  The Bad Object has two facets: the antilibidinal ego argues with and complains about its mistreatment to the rejecting object in an attempt to reform it, while the libidinal ego seeks ways to find out how to please the exciting object which promises it love which is always out of reach. Neither part-self (antilibidinal ego, libidinal ego) is willing to give up their quest, and neither part object (rejecting object and exciting object) is willing to concede defeat, and neither of the object representations (rejecting or exciting) is willing to give either of the child's two selves any satisfaction.      \n\n'''Dissociation and the Splitting of the Ego'''  \n\nPrior to Fairbairn, the defense of dissociation was seen as an extreme defense that was only used  in life-threatening situations. Fairbairn's work in an orphanage convinced him that  children separated from their families had experienced a major trauma that required the dissociative defense to prevent a complete psychic collapse. The dissociative defense erased the event from their consciousness. The memory of the abandonment  along with the  memory of the parents reasons for their actions are forced into the unconscious and held there by repression. This allows the abandoned child to continue loving a parent that he/she sees as completely supportive. In families where rejection is commonplace, the thousands upon thousands of dissociated memories accrue and become powerful sub-personalities. Memories of the angry, annoyed, rejecting or indifferent parent coalesce in the child's unconscious and become a single representation of the angry parent already described as the rejecting object. The child must also dissociate memories of himself during the interpersonally rejecting interactions into the antilibidinal ego. These memories of the child's self as suffused with fear, defeat, shame and humiliation that cannot be tolerated consciously.     \n\n'''The Splitting''' '''Defense''' allows the child to hate the rejecting object with a feral rage, and to love the exciting object with all its heart. Splitting is a defense that prevents the integration of Good and Bad Object memories into a single whole object. Thus, the individual  '''never develops \"object constancy\"''' which is the ability to see a person's goodness, even when they are being rejected or frustrated by that person. Thus, a very important developmental milestone is not achieved, and the individual functions at an earlier stage of psychological  development, often throughout life. Splitting causes the individual to respond to external objects '''as if they were two different people.''' When the individual is frustrated they see the object as '''\"all bad\"''' and devoid of any goodness. Conversely, when they are dominated by their  libidinal ego structure they see the object as \"'''all good'''\". This style of relating to the world defines the Borderline Personality disorder (Celani, 1993,2010 <ref>{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=The Treatment of the Borderline Patient: Applying Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting|publisher=International Universities Press|year=1993|isbn=0-8236-6644-1|location=|pages=}}</ref> <ref name=\":4\" />. Fairbairn described this shift in ego states in the earlier quote that addressed the fact that one ego state could repress another ego state, resulting in a person who experiences the world through a \"multiplicity of egos\". Developmentally, this is equivalent to the child who screams at her mother in a rage, and moments  later says \"I love you, Mommy\". The dominant ego state has no awareness of the other ego state which has just been repressed. Equally importantly, powerful, emotion filled memories are dissociated, which impoverishes and weakens the central ego, which is unaware of significant realities from its developmental history, and is unable to hold onto a single view of their interpersonal world<ref>{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|url=|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting Columbia University Press|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=|pages=|oclc=}}</ref>. \n\n==== Resistance Based on the Two Sub Ego's Mission to Reform the Object ====\n\nThe reality that Fairbairn's structural theory contains six different structures is a source of difficulty in terms of its adoption by the analytic community, as it is more complex than Freud's three structure theory. It also forces the user to think in terms of self and object, rather that the individual in isolation. This model represents a whole new vision of the psychological functioning of the human personality, which is very different to the original Libido Theory. Fairbairn's model is one of relationships in which there are constant dialogues between the structures. That is, the relational pattern that was internalized during childhood includes  typical dialogues that were originally experienced in the external world, but now continue in the internal world. For example the antagonistic and bickering  relationship between the antilibidinal ego and the internalized rejecting object  continues unabated in dialogues between them, as described by Ogden.  <blockquote>\"Neither the rejecting object nor the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego) is willing or able to think about, much less relinquish, that tie. In fact, there is no desire on the part of either to change anything about their mutual dependence. The power of that bond is impossible to overestimate. The rejecting object and the internal saboteur are determined to nurse their feelings of having been deeply wronged, cheated, humiliated, betrayed, exploited, treated unfairly, discriminated against, and so on. The mistreatment at the hands of the other is felt to be unforgivable. An apology is forever expected by each, but never offered by either\" (Odgen,,2010,p.109)<ref>{{Citation|last=Ogden|first=Thomas H.|title=The International Journal of Psychoanalysis|date=2010|volume=91|pages=101-118|chapter=|publisher=|doi=|isbn=978-0-429-47453-8}}</ref></blockquote>Fairbairn's first quote on source of resistance that he discussed in the 1943 paper, about the de-repression of internalized objects creating a frightening world \"peopled with  devils\", he mentioned \"another factor\" which created resistance, which he discussed in his 1944 paper. This second factor is the intense attachment between the libidinal ego and its exciting object, which is an attachment that is fueled by need and unfulfilled desire.The libidinal ego of  the neglected child lives in a world of hopeful fantasies and he/she cannot give up hope in their parents because his/her entire world would crash down upon them if he/she were to accept that indeed, there was no hope. <blockquote>There can be no room for doubt that the obstinate attachment of the libidinal ego to the exciting object and its reluctance to renounce this object constitute a particularly formidable source of resistance -and one which plays no small part in determining what is known as the as the negative therapeutic reaction...The truth is that, however well the fact may be disguised, the individual is extremely reluctant to abandon his original hate, no less than his original need of his original objects in childhood (Fairbairn, 1952,p.117)<ref name=\":2\" />.</blockquote>Fairbairn uses the concept of \"Negative Therapeutic Reaction\" in this quote, which  is defined as a hostile reaction by a patient to treatment regardless of the skill or experience of the therapist. Patient's who are deeply involved in their inner world, and who are re-fighting all the battles of their childhood, will tolerate no interference of their  ongoing battles and will  experience the therapist as an unwelcome intruder. These two quotes demonstrate that  '''resistance to change is fueled by both sub-egos in the inner world.''' The antilibidinal ego does not want to give up its quest to reform the rejecting object's view of him, while the libidinal ego refuses to give up on the fantasy that there is still some hidden love in his objects. Clinically, if the therapist insists at the outset of treatment that the patient separate from his/her parents and live on their own, he/she might precipitate an abandonment crisis that may endanger further treatment. The patient needs a secure attachment to an external object before any of these internal ties can be given up. Once again, Fairbairn's model is consistent and logical in that the original source of psychopathology is the internalization of bad objects. Once internalized,  the original motives of the sub egos as they struggle with the two internalized objects, continues to operate in the inner world. When this factor is combined with the earlier description of resistance as coming from the patients fear of the powerful emotions associated with the de-repression of internalized bad objects, coupled with the emotional loss of all of his fantasies about belonging to a family, resistance becomes completely understandable within this model.\n\n==== The Variable Strength of the Ego Structures ====\nFairbairn's  structural model is the beginning stage of a multiple personality, however '''it never develops beyond this steady state.''' As described, the central ego develops in relationship to the supportive and nurturing parent(s), the Ideal Object(s). The strength and size of the Central Ego '''varies from child to child''' according to how many positive, ego enhancing activities and interpersonal events they have experienced with their parents during the course of  their development. Fairbairn's model assumes that actual events in the external world are internalized and  summate in both the conscious central ego and in the unconscious structures as well. Thus large numbers of loving, non-intrusive, and emotionally supportive interactions with the parent(s) enhance the child's central ego through daily positive relating. As the child develops over time his trust in others allows him to interact with peers  and adults and he is able to develop new skills, as well as enlarge a more complex view of himself through interactions with others who see aspects of himself that his parents have not discovered. \n\nIn less favorable developmental conditions, where support, nurturance and reassurance is scarce or absent, the child's central ego does not develop a richer and more rounded sense of self, rather the  development of his central ego is thwarted rather than enhanced. Its focus is a finely attuned search for any positive, supportive responses from his parents. At the same time, his many negative experiences are being dissociated and repressed, and his central ego loses sight of the many important (but negative) events in his childhood, which are banished (and remain) in his unconscious structures.  '''The ratio of''' '''conscious to unconscious structures''' shifts away from conscious relationships with external objects to the child's powerful and richly populated unconscious, with the endless bickering between the antilibidinal ego and the rejecting object, and the unrealistic fantasy world of the libidinal ego. A powerful unconscious that is filled with constant dialogues influences the weakened central ego which interprets all of reality in terms of the rigid role-relationships that are active in his unconscious. These internal templates cloud reality and become the source of both transference and repetition compulsions.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory In the Clinical Setting|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=New York|pages=51\u201371}}</ref> \n\n'''Transference and  Repetition Compulsions'''\n\nWhen any individual superimposes or projects his inner structures on an external object (for instance, his rejecting object) then he is going to misperceive that individual's intentions and behavior, and relate to him in a passive-aggressive and hostile manner. Thus projection of the inner structures onto external objects becomes the source of transference.  This occurs in individuals who have richly suffused unconscious structures which easily override the perceptions of the central ego.<br />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.columbia.edu/~rr322/FAIRBAIRN.html 'Fairbairn's Structural Model'], Richard L.

Often the abscess will start as an internal wound caused by ulceration, hard stool, or penetrative objects with insufficient lubrication.  This wound typically becomes infected as a result of the normal presence of feces in the rectal area, and then develops into an abscess.  This often presents itself as a lump of tissue near the [[anus]] which grows larger and more painful with time.  Like other abscesses, perianal abscesses may require prompt medical treatment, such as an incision and [[debridement]] or [[Lancing (surgical procedure)|lancing]].\n\n{{Anchor|Incisional abscess}}\n\n===Incisional abscess===\nAn ''incisional abscess'' is one that develops as a complication secondary to a [[surgical incision]].

The cytokines trigger an [[inflammation|inflammatory response]], which draws large numbers of [[white blood cell]]s to the area and increases the regional blood flow.\n\nThe final structure of the abscess is an abscess wall, or capsule, that is formed by the adjacent healthy cells in an attempt to keep the pus from infecting neighboring structures. However, such encapsulation tends to prevent immune cells from attacking bacteria in the pus, or from reaching the causative organism or foreign object.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Blausen 0007 Abscess.png|A diagram of an abscess\nfile:Pyemic abscesses of kidney.jpg|[[Pyaemia|Pyemic]] abscesses of [[kidney]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:UOTW 66 - Ultrasound of the Week 1.webm|thumb|Ultrasound showing an abscess of the skin<ref>{{cite web|title=UOTW #66 - Ultrasound of the Week|url=https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-66/|website=Ultrasound of the Week|accessdate=27 May 2017|date=7 January 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161102223449/http://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-66/|archivedate=2 November 2016}}</ref>]]\n\n[[File:Ultrasound image of breast 110323101432 1023060.jpg|Ultrasound image of breast abscess, appearing as a mushroom-shaped dark (hypoechoic) area|thumb]]\n\nAn abscess is a localized collection of pus (purulent inflammatory tissue) caused by suppuration buried in a tissue, an organ, or a confined space, lined by the pyogenic membrane.<ref>Robins/8th/68</ref> [[Ultrasound]] imaging in the emergency department can help in a diagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barbic|first1=D|last2=Chenkin|first2=J|last3=Cho|first3=DD|last4=Jelic|first4=T|last5=Scheuermeyer|first5=FX|title=In patients presenting to the emergency department with skin and soft tissue infections what is the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care ultrasonography for the diagnosis of abscess compared to the current standard of care?

The drainage of a lung abscess may be performed by positioning the patient in a way that enables the contents to be discharged via the [[respiratory tract]].  Warm compresses and elevation of the limb may be beneficial for a skin abscess.\n\n=== Antibiotics ===\nMost people who have an uncomplicated skin abscess should not use antibiotics.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> Antibiotics in addition to standard incision and drainage is recommended in persons with severe abscesses, many sites of infection, rapid disease progression, the presence of [[cellulitis]], symptoms indicating bacterial illness throughout the body, or a health condition causing [[immunosuppression]].<ref name=NEJM2014/> People who are very young or very old may also need antibiotics.<ref name=NEJM2014/> If the abscess does not heal only with incision and drainage, or if the abscess is in a place that is difficult to drain such as the face, hands, or genitals, then antibiotics may be indicated.<ref name=NEJM2014/>\n\nIn those cases of abscess which do require antibiotic treatment, ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' bacteria is a common cause and an anti-staphylococcus antibiotic such as [[flucloxacillin]] or [[dicloxacillin]] is used. The [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]] advises that the draining of an abscess is not enough to address community-acquired [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA), and in those cases, traditional antibiotics may be ineffective.<ref name=NEJM2014/> Alternative antibiotics effective against community-acquired MRSA often include [[clindamycin]], [[doxycycline]], [[minocycline]], and [[trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole]].<ref name=NEJM2014/> The [[American College of Emergency Physicians]] advises that typical cases of abscess from MRSA get no benefit from having antibiotic treatment in addition to the standard treatment.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> If the condition is thought to be [[cellulitis]] rather than abscess, consideration should be given to possibility of strep species as cause that are still sensitive to traditional anti-staphylococcus agents such as dicloxacillin or cephalexin in patients able to tolerate penicillin. [[Antibiotic]] therapy alone without surgical drainage of the abscess is seldom effective due to antibiotics often being unable to get into the abscess and their ineffectiveness at low [[pH]] levels.\n\n[[Cell culture|Culturing the wound]] is not needed if standard follow-up care can be provided after the incision and drainage.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> Performing a wound culture is unnecessary because it rarely gives information which can be used to guide treatment.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/>\n\n===Packing===\nIn North America, after drainage, an abscess cavity is often packed, perhaps with cloth, in an attempt to protect the healing wound. However, evidence from emergency medicine literature reports that packing wounds after draining causes pain to the person and does not decrease the rate of recurrence, nor bring faster healing or fewer physician visits.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bergstrom|first=KG|title=News, views, and reviews.

The drainage of a lung abscess may be performed by positioning the patient in a way that enables the contents to be discharged via the [[respiratory tract]].  Warm compresses and elevation of the limb may be beneficial for a skin abscess.\n\n=== Antibiotics ===\nMost people who have an uncomplicated skin abscess should not use antibiotics.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> Antibiotics in addition to standard incision and drainage is recommended in persons with severe abscesses, many sites of infection, rapid disease progression, the presence of [[cellulitis]], symptoms indicating bacterial illness throughout the body, or a health condition causing [[immunosuppression]].<ref name=NEJM2014/> People who are very young or very old may also need antibiotics.<ref name=NEJM2014/> If the abscess does not heal only with incision and drainage, or if the abscess is in a place that is difficult to drain such as the face, hands, or genitals, then antibiotics may be indicated.<ref name=NEJM2014/>\n\nIn those cases of abscess which do require antibiotic treatment, ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' bacteria is a common cause and an anti-staphylococcus antibiotic such as [[flucloxacillin]] or [[dicloxacillin]] is used. The [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]] advises that the draining of an abscess is not enough to address community-acquired [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA), and in those cases, traditional antibiotics may be ineffective.<ref name=NEJM2014/> Alternative antibiotics effective against community-acquired MRSA often include [[clindamycin]], [[doxycycline]], [[minocycline]], and [[trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole]].<ref name=NEJM2014/> The [[American College of Emergency Physicians]] advises that typical cases of abscess from MRSA get no benefit from having antibiotic treatment in addition to the standard treatment.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> If the condition is thought to be [[cellulitis]] rather than abscess, consideration should be given to possibility of strep species as cause that are still sensitive to traditional anti-staphylococcus agents such as dicloxacillin or cephalexin in patients able to tolerate penicillin. [[Antibiotic]] therapy alone without surgical drainage of the abscess is seldom effective due to antibiotics often being unable to get into the abscess and their ineffectiveness at low [[pH]] levels.\n\n[[Cell culture|Culturing the wound]] is not needed if standard follow-up care can be provided after the incision and drainage.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> Performing a wound culture is unnecessary because it rarely gives information which can be used to guide treatment.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/>\n\n===Packing===\nIn North America, after drainage, an abscess cavity is often packed, perhaps with cloth, in an attempt to protect the healing wound. However, evidence from emergency medicine literature reports that packing wounds after draining causes pain to the person and does not decrease the rate of recurrence, nor bring faster healing or fewer physician visits.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bergstrom|first=KG|title=News, views, and reviews.

Endemic to southern Africa, the wasp-like bees of this genus are generally small, varying from {{convert|3.9|to|9|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length, and mostly black, with orange-ish or reddish colouring of the [[metasoma]] in some of the species.  The bee genus ''[[Scrapter]]'' is recognised as a host for the cleptoparasitic life cycle of some ''Sphecodopsis'', but further data regarding preferred hosts is not available for most of the species.<ref name=\"eardley\"/><ref name=\"michener\"/><ref name=\"rozen & michener\"/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nGerman entomologist [[Hans Bischoff]] first described the genus in 1923 in the work \"Kenntnis afrikanischer Schmarotzerbienen\", published in the ''Deutsche entomologische Zeitschrift''.  The genus name is Greek for \"wasp-like\", with \"spheco-\" meaning wasp.\n\nOf the fourteen currently recognised species, several of them were originally described under a different genus and have subsequently been included in ''Sphecodopsis''.  Some of the species in the genus are generally still poorly defined, owing to the lack of collection and study of specimens of both sexes.<ref name=\"eardley\"/>\n\nThe type species assigned to ''Sphecodopsis'' by Bischoff is ''[[Sphecodopsis capicola|S. capicola]]'', originally designated ''Omachthes capicola'' in 1911 by [[Embrik Strand]].<ref name=\"eardley\"/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nMost species in the genus are found exclusively in South Africa; only two of the species are known to have a range that extends to the greater part of southern Africa.  This distribution pattern is not overly significant or surprising considering that South Africa, with its diverse climate, topography, and areas of reliably high rainfall, accounts for over 50% of all [[Afrotropical realm|Afrotropical]] bee genera.<ref name=\"kuhlmann\"/><ref name=\"eardley 2007\"/>\n\nPreferred habitats of ''Sphecodopsis'' vary from species to species, though a significant proportion of them are concentrated in the [[Namaqualand]] region and the [[Western Cape]].  Areas of reliable high seasonal rainfall are popular with the bees, owing in part to the abundance of flora and to the associated prosperity of pollen-collecting bees whose nests may be used as hosts for their larvae.<ref name=\"kuhlmann\"/><ref name=\"eardley 2007\"/>\n\n==Morphology==\nThe bees are overall very wasp-like in appearance, lacking [[Scopa (biology)|scopae]] and being slender and far less hairy than many non-cleptoparasitic bees.  The colouration of the metasoma is also more typical of wasps.  The lack of pollen-collecting scopae is an evolutionary loss of structure that is common to almost all cleptoparastic bees as they have no need to gather pollen, nor nests in which to store it.<ref name=\"eardley\"/><ref name=\"michener cleptoparasitic\"/>\n\nSpecies in this genus vary from {{convert|3.9|to|9|mm|in|abbr=on}} in size, considered small for bees.  The head and the [[mesosoma]] are always black, although there may be orange or red colouration of [[Insect mouthparts|mouthparts]], antennae, or legs.  The metasoma is black in some of the species but orange or red, to various degrees, in the others.  Hairs, sometimes plumose, are either white or black.  In profile the [[Scutellum (insect anatomy)|scutellum]] is curved evenly and gently.  The antennae of the females have 12 segments and those of males have 13.  The [[tergum]] of both males and females lacks a pygidial plate.  In the tribe Ammobatini the [[Labrum (arthropod mouthpart)|labrum]] is longer than it is broad, which is an unusual characteristic in Apidae, and in ''Sphecodopsis'' specifically the labrum is also apically pointed.<ref name=\"eardley\"/><ref name=\"michener\"/><ref name=\"eardley 2007\"/>\n\nThe eggs and the larvae of two species of ''Sphecodopsis'', ''[[Sphecodopsis capensis|S. capensis]]'' and ''[[Sphecodopsis fumipennis|S. fumipennis]]'', have been thoroughly described, while larval information for the other species remains mostly unstudied or unpublished.  Eggs are smaller than the size of the adult suggests, whitish, and long with a gentle curve, narrowing to a rounded point.  The first [[instar]] of the larva has a forked abdominal tip that allows it to crawl inside the nest cell.  The head capsule is pigmented and its abdomen is slender.  It possesses long sickle-shaped mandibles that enable it to destroy any other eggs or larvae in the cell.<ref name=\"rozen & michener\"/>  In the second instar the forked abdominal tip remains but the mandibles are much reduced, and the body extends laterally, presumably a flotation aid as food stores become gradually liquefied in the cell.  This description applies to both of the species studied, and may be markedly different for other species in the genus, although certain features, such as strong mandibles for destroying competition in the cell, are presumably the same in design and function.<ref name=\"rozen & michener\"/>\n\n==Behaviour and life cycle==\nFemales lay their small eggs in the nests of [[solitary bee]]s that they have chosen as hosts.  ''S. capensis'' and ''S. fumipennis'' females have been observed watching the entrance of a host's nest from a distance for up to thirty minutes, waiting until the host is absent before approaching to lay eggs.  The eggs are laid so that the [[Operculum (animal)|operculum]] is flush with the inside of the cell, and the rest of the egg hidden in the lining.  ''Sphecodopsis'' females choose cells that are not yet sealed, so there is a chance the egg will be discovered by the host as it makes further provisions before sealing.  After hatching, the first [[instar]] is active and predatory and kills with its mandibles any other eggs or larvae it finds inside the cell, including those of its siblings, if present.<ref name=\"rozen & michener\"/>  The subsequent instars are more similar to those of other bees and focused mainly on feeding on the provisions before pupation.<ref name=\"rozen & michener\"/><ref name=\"michener cleptoparasitic\"/>\n\nLittle information is available regarding the plants that the adult ''Sphecodopsis'' prefers visiting.  Where a floral record has been made, based on limited observations of only two species, the plant genera noted are ''[[Grielum]]'', ''[[Helichrysum]]'', ''[[Senecio]]'', and ''[[Hemimeris]]''.<ref name=\"eardley\"/>\n\n==Species==\n* ''[[Sphecodopsis aculeata]]'' <small>(Friese, 1922)</small>\n* ''[[Sphecodopsis argyrura]]'' <small>(Cockerell, 1933)</small>\n* ''[[Sphecodopsis capensis]]'' <small>(Friese, 1915)</small>\n* ''[[Sphecodopsis capicola]]'' <small>(Strand, 1911)</small>\n* ''[[Sphecodopsis carolinae]]'' <small>Eardley, 2007</small>\n* ''[[Sphecodopsis fumipennis]]'' <small>(Bischoff, 1923)</small>\n* ''[[Sphecodopsis kuhlmanni]]'' <small>Eardley, 2007</small>\n* ''[[Sphecodopsis longipygidium]]'' <small>Eardley, 1997</small>\n* ''[[Sphecodopsis minutissima]]'' <small>(Cockerell, 1933)</small>\n* ''[[Sphecodopsis namaquensis]]'' <small>Eardley, 1997</small>\n* ''[[Sphecodopsis papilla]]'' <small>Eardley, 2007</small>\n* ''[[Sphecodopsis semirufa]]'' <small>(Cockerell, 1933)</small>\n* ''[[Sphecodopsis vespericena]]'' <small>Eardley, 1997</small>\n* ''[[Sphecodopsis villosa]]'' <small>(Friese, 1909)</small>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2|refs=\n<ref name=\"eardley\">{{cite journal\n | last =Eardley\n | first =Connal D.\n |author2=Brothers, Denis J.\n  | title =Phylogeny of the Ammobatini and revision of the Afrotropical genera (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Nomadinae)\n | journal =Journal of Hymenoptera Research\n | volume =6\n | issue =2\n | pages =398\u2013409\n | publisher =International Society of Hymenopterists\n | date =October 1997\n | url =https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/26143\n | issn =1070-9428\n | accessdate = 2013-02-12}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"kuhlmann\">{{cite journal\n | last = Kuhlmann\n | first = M.\n | title =Patterns of diversity, endemism and distribution of bees (Insecta: Hymenoptera: Anthophila) in southern Africa\n | journal =South African Journal of Botany\n | volume =75\n | issue =4\n | pages =726\u2013738\n | date =October 2009\n | doi =10.1016/j.sajb.2009.06.016| doi-access =free\n }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"eardley 2007\">{{cite journal\n | last =Eardley\n | first = Connal D.\n | title =Three new species of ''Sphecodopsis'' Bischoff (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Nomadinae)\n | journal =African Entomology\n | volume =15\n | issue =1\n | pages =193\u2013196\n | date =March 2007\n | doi =10.4001/1021-3589-15.1.193}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"michener\">{{cite book\n | last =Michener\n | first =Charles D.\n | authorlink =Charles Duncan Michener\n | title =The Bees of the World\n | publisher =[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]\n | edition =second\n | date =May 2007\n | pages = 661, 664\n | isbn =978-0801885730\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"rozen & michener\">{{cite journal\n | last =Rozen\n | first =Jerome G., Jr.\n |author2=Michener, Charles D.\n  | title =The Biology of ''Scrapter'' and its Cuckoo Bee, ''Pseudodichroa'' (Hymenoptera: Colletidae and Anthophoridae)\n | journal =American Museum Novitates\n | issue =2335\n | pages =9\u201311\n | publisher =American Museum of Natural History\n | date =July 1968\n | hdl =2246/2545\n }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"michener cleptoparasitic\">{{cite book\n | last =Michener\n | first =Charles D.\n | authorlink =Charles Duncan Michener\n | title =The Bees of the World\n | publisher =[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]\n | edition =second\n | date =May 2007\n | pages = 31\u201341\n | isbn =978-0801885730\n}}</ref>\n}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q7576607}}\n\n[[Category:Nomadinae]]\n[[Category:Hymenoptera of Africa]]\n[[Category:Bee genera]]\n", "text_old": "{{Automatic taxobox\n| image = Sphecodopsis sp, Sandveld, 2012.jpg\n| taxon = Sphecodopsis\n| authority = [[Hans Bischoff|Bischoff]], 1923\n| subdivision_ranks = Species\n| subdivision = See text\n}}\n\n'''''Sphecodopsis''''' is a genus of [[kleptoparasitism|cleptoparasitic]] [[cuckoo bee|\"cuckoo\" bees]] in the family [[Apidae]].

The genus name is Greek for \"wasp-like\", with \"spheco-\" meaning wasp.\n\nOf the fourteen currently recognised species, several of them were originally described under a different genus and have subsequently been included in ''Sphecodopsis''.  Some of the species in the genus are generally still poorly defined, owing to the lack of collection and study of specimens of both sexes.<ref name=\"eardley\"/>\n\nThe type species assigned to ''Sphecodopsis'' by Bischoff is ''[[Sphecodopsis capicola|S. capicola]]'', originally designated ''Omachthes capicola'' in 1911 by [[Embrik Strand]].<ref name=\"eardley\"/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nMost species in the genus are found exclusively in South Africa; only two of the species are known to have a range that extends to the greater part of southern Africa.  This distribution pattern is not overly significant or surprising considering that South Africa, with its diverse climate, topography, and areas of reliably high rainfall, accounts for over 50% of all [[Afrotropic ecozone|Afrotropical]] bee genera.<ref name=\"kuhlmann\"/><ref name=\"eardley 2007\"/>\n\nPreferred habitats of ''Sphecodopsis'' vary from species to species, though a significant proportion of them are concentrated in the [[Namaqualand]] region and the [[Western Cape]].  Areas of reliable high seasonal rainfall are popular with the bees, owing in part to the abundance of flora and to the associated prosperity of pollen-collecting bees whose nests may be used as hosts for their larvae.<ref name=\"kuhlmann\"/><ref name=\"eardley 2007\"/>\n\n==Morphology==\nThe bees are overall very wasp-like in appearance, lacking [[Scopa (biology)|scopae]] and being slender and far less hairy than many non-cleptoparasitic bees.  The colouration of the metasoma is also more typical of wasps.  The lack of pollen-collecting scopae is an evolutionary loss of structure that is common to almost all cleptoparastic bees as they have no need to gather pollen, nor nests in which to store it.<ref name=\"eardley\"/><ref name=\"michener cleptoparasitic\"/>\n\nSpecies in this genus vary from {{convert|3.9|to|9|mm|in|abbr=on}} in size, considered small for bees.  The head and the [[mesosoma]] are always black, although there may be orange or red colouration of [[Insect mouthparts|mouthparts]], antennae, or legs.  The metasoma is black in some of the species but orange or red, to various degrees, in the others.  Hairs, sometimes plumose, are either white or black.  In profile the [[Scutellum (insect anatomy)|scutellum]] is curved evenly and gently.  The antennae of the females have 12 segments and those of males have 13.  The [[tergum]] of both males and females lacks a pygidial plate.  In the tribe Ammobatini the [[Labrum (arthropod mouthpart)|labrum]] is longer than it is broad, which is an unusual characteristic in Apidae, and in ''Sphecodopsis'' specifically the labrum is also apically pointed.<ref name=\"eardley\"/><ref name=\"michener\"/><ref name=\"eardley 2007\"/>\n\nThe eggs and the larvae of two species of ''Sphecodopsis'', ''[[Sphecodopsis capensis|S. capensis]]'' and ''[[Sphecodopsis fumipennis|S. fumipennis]]'', have been thoroughly described, while larval information for the other species remains mostly unstudied or unpublished.  Eggs are smaller than the size of the adult suggests, whitish, and long with a gentle curve, narrowing to a rounded point.  The first [[instar]] of the larva has a forked abdominal tip that allows it to crawl inside the nest cell.  The head capsule is pigmented and its abdomen is slender.  It possesses long sickle-shaped mandibles that enable it to destroy any other eggs or larvae in the cell.<ref name=\"rozen & michener\"/>  In the second instar the forked abdominal tip remains but the mandibles are much reduced, and the body extends laterally, presumably a flotation aid as food stores become gradually liquefied in the cell.  This description applies to both of the species studied, and may be markedly different for other species in the genus, although certain features, such as strong mandibles for destroying competition in the cell, are presumably the same in design and function.<ref name=\"rozen & michener\"/>\n\n==Behaviour and life cycle==\nFemales lay their small eggs in the nests of [[solitary bee]]s that they have chosen as hosts.  ''S. capensis'' and ''S. fumipennis'' females have been observed watching the entrance of a host's nest from a distance for up to thirty minutes, waiting until the host is absent before approaching to lay eggs.  The eggs are laid so that the [[Operculum (animal)|operculum]] is flush with the inside of the cell, and the rest of the egg hidden in the lining.  ''Sphecodopsis'' females choose cells that are not yet sealed, so there is a chance the egg will be discovered by the host as it makes further provisions before sealing.  After hatching, the first [[instar]] is active and predatory and kills with its mandibles any other eggs or larvae it finds inside the cell, including those of its siblings, if present.<ref name=\"rozen & michener\"/>  The subsequent instars are more similar to those of other bees and focused mainly on feeding on the provisions before pupation.<ref name=\"rozen & michener\"/><ref name=\"michener cleptoparasitic\"/>\n\nLittle information is available regarding the plants that the adult ''Sphecodopsis'' prefers visiting.  Where a floral record has been made, based on limited observations of only two species, the plant genera noted are ''[[Grielum]]'', ''[[Helichrysum]]'', ''[[Senecio]]'', and ''[[Hemimeris]]''.<ref name=\"eardley\"/>\n\n==Species==\n* ''[[Sphecodopsis aculeata]]'' <small>(Friese, 1922)</small>\n* ''[[Sphecodopsis argyrura]]'' <small>(Cockerell, 1933)</small>\n* ''[[Sphecodopsis capensis]]'' <small>(Friese, 1915)</small>\n* ''[[Sphecodopsis capicola]]'' <small>(Strand, 1911)</small>\n* ''[[Sphecodopsis carolinae]]'' <small>Eardley, 2007</small>\n* ''[[Sphecodopsis fumipennis]]'' <small>(Bischoff, 1923)</small>\n* ''[[Sphecodopsis kuhlmanni]]'' <small>Eardley, 2007</small>\n* ''[[Sphecodopsis longipygidium]]'' <small>Eardley, 1997</small>\n* ''[[Sphecodopsis minutissima]]'' <small>(Cockerell, 1933)</small>\n* ''[[Sphecodopsis namaquensis]]'' <small>Eardley, 1997</small>\n* ''[[Sphecodopsis papilla]]'' <small>Eardley, 2007</small>\n* ''[[Sphecodopsis semirufa]]'' <small>(Cockerell, 1933)</small>\n* ''[[Sphecodopsis vespericena]]'' <small>Eardley, 1997</small>\n* ''[[Sphecodopsis villosa]]'' <small>(Friese, 1909)</small>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2|refs=\n<ref name=\"eardley\">{{cite journal\n | last =Eardley\n | first =Connal D.\n |author2=Brothers, Denis J.\n  | title =Phylogeny of the Ammobatini and revision of the Afrotropical genera (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Nomadinae)\n | journal =Journal of Hymenoptera Research\n | volume =6\n | issue =2\n | pages =398\u2013409\n | publisher =International Society of Hymenopterists\n | date =October 1997\n | url =https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/26143\n | issn =1070-9428\n | accessdate = 2013-02-12}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"kuhlmann\">{{cite journal\n | last = Kuhlmann\n | first = M.\n | title =Patterns of diversity, endemism and distribution of bees (Insecta: Hymenoptera: Anthophila) in southern Africa\n | journal =South African Journal of Botany\n | volume =75\n | issue =4\n | pages =726\u2013738\n | date =October 2009\n | doi =10.1016/j.sajb.2009.06.016| doi-access =free\n }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"eardley 2007\">{{cite journal\n | last =Eardley\n | first = Connal D.\n | title =Three new species of ''Sphecodopsis'' Bischoff (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Nomadinae)\n | journal =African Entomology\n | volume =15\n | issue =1\n | pages =193\u2013196\n | date =March 2007\n | doi =10.4001/1021-3589-15.1.193}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"michener\">{{cite book\n | last =Michener\n | first =Charles D.\n | authorlink =Charles Duncan Michener\n | title =The Bees of the World\n | publisher =[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]\n | edition =second\n | date =May 2007\n | pages = 661, 664\n | isbn =978-0801885730\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"rozen & michener\">{{cite journal\n | last =Rozen\n | first =Jerome G., Jr.\n |author2=Michener, Charles D.\n  | title =The Biology of ''Scrapter'' and its Cuckoo Bee, ''Pseudodichroa'' (Hymenoptera: Colletidae and Anthophoridae)\n | journal =American Museum Novitates\n | issue =2335\n | pages =9\u201311\n | publisher =American Museum of Natural History\n | date =July 1968\n | hdl =2246/2545\n }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"michener cleptoparasitic\">{{cite book\n | last =Michener\n | first =Charles D.\n | authorlink =Charles Duncan Michener\n | title =The Bees of the World\n | publisher =[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]\n | edition =second\n | date =May 2007\n | pages = 31\u201341\n | isbn =978-0801885730\n}}</ref>\n}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q7576607}}\n\n[[Category:Nomadinae]]\n[[Category:Hymenoptera of Africa]]\n[[Category:Bee genera]]\n", "name_user": "Tom Radulovich", "label": "safe", "comment": "Afrotropic ecozone > Afrotropical realm", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphecodopsis"}

'Whelen, Christopher' in Grove Music Online]</ref> Already interested in [[Celts (modern)|Celtic]] culture (particularly [[Yeats]]), the music of [[Arnold Bax]] became a central influence for Whelen after hearing a performance of [[Tintagel (Bax)|Tintagel]].<ref>Foreman, Lewis. ''Bax: A Composer and His Times'' (1983)</ref> A correspondence began in 1947, which led to a lifelong friendship. Around 40 of the letters have been published. In 1951 Whelen conducted Bax's Sixth Symphony in Bournemouth. Bax wrote: \"I still dote on your performance of No 6 and want a repeat\".<ref name=tempo>Scott-Sutherland, Colin. 'Review, Cuchulan Among the Guns' in ''Tempo'' No 2015, January 2001, p 34-5</ref>\n\nHowever, from 1951 Whelen became musical director at the [[Old Vic Theatre]] in London and most of his conducting commitments were dropped. While there (and from 1955 at other theatres as well) he produced much incidental music for [[Shakespeare]] and other productions.<ref>''Shakespeare Quarterly'', Vol 7 No 1 (Winter 1956), p 85-6</ref> He composed the music  for [[John Osborne]]'s ''[[The World of Paul Slickey]]'' (1959). This was Osborne's only attempt to write a musical. But after the huge successes of his previous plays ''[[Look Back in Anger]]'' and ''[[The Entertainer (play)|The Entertainer]],'' the play was to become \"one of the most spectacular disasters in English theatre\".<ref>Heilpern, John, ''John Osborne: A Patriot for Us'', 2007, Random House, pp.249-54</ref> Despite this setback, the theatre work led to a series of commissions by the [[BBC]] spanning the 1960s to the 1980s for radio productions with original music, including television and radio operas as well as hard to classify music dramas for which Whelen typically wrote both the words and music, fusing the music and action together.\n\nWhelen lived in [[Cumnor]], Oxfordshire for several years before his death in 1993.
