In reference to the photo, B.B. King stated, \n\"Yes; the old Fender amplifiers were the best that were ever made, in my opinion. They had a good sound and they were durable; guys would throw them in the truck and they\u2019d hold up. They had tubes, and they\u2019d get real hot, but they just had a sound that is hard to put into words. The Fender Twin was great, but I have an old Lab Series amp that isn\u2019t being made anymore. I fell in love with it, because its sound is right between the old Fender amps that we used to have and the Fender Twin.

King Lucille model, a ES-355 with stereo options, a varitone selector and fine tuners (neither of which were actually utilized by B.B.) and, at King's direct request, no f-holes to further reduce feedback. In 2005, Gibson made a special run of 80 Gibson Lucilles, referred to as the \"80th Birthday Lucille\", the first prototype of which was given as a birthday gift to King, and which he used thereafter.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.guitarcenterblog.com/?p=746 |title=One Customer's Pawnshop Treasure |publisher=Guitarcenterblog.com |date=December 3, 2009 |accessdate=May 16, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618045219/http://www.guitarcenterblog.com/?p=746 |archivedate=June 18, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nKing used a Lab Series L5 2\u00d712\" combo amplifier and had been using this amplifier for a long time.

In reference to the photo, B.B. King stated, \n\"Yes; the old Fender amplifiers were the best that were ever made, in my opinion. They had a good sound and they were durable; guys would throw them in the truck and they\u2019d hold up. They had tubes, and they\u2019d get real hot, but they just had a sound that is hard to put into words. The Fender Twin was great, but I have an old Lab Series amp that isn\u2019t being made anymore. I fell in love with it, because its sound is right between the old Fender amps that we used to have and the Fender Twin.

King Lucille model, a ES-355 with stereo options, a varitone selector and fine tuners (neither of which were actually utilized by B.B.) and, at King's direct request, no f-holes to further reduce feedback. In 2005, Gibson made a special run of 80 Gibson Lucilles, referred to as the \"80th Birthday Lucille\", the first prototype of which was given as a birthday gift to King, and which he used thereafter.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.guitarcenterblog.com/?p=746 |title=One Customer's Pawnshop Treasure |publisher=Guitarcenterblog.com |date=December 3, 2009 |accessdate=May 16, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618045219/http://www.guitarcenterblog.com/?p=746 |archivedate=June 18, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nKing used a Lab Series L5 2\u00d712\" combo amplifier and had been using this amplifier for a long time.

The sharp point helps in making the tuckpointed fine line smooth.

Standard tuckpointing tools come in widths from as little as 1 mm to up to 14 mm wide, so these tools can be used for very fine detailed work up to wide stone tuckpointing work.\n\nLengths of tools also vary depending on personal preferences, but the most common lengths are usually between 75 and 125&nbsp;mm. However professionals sometimes like a much shorter tool, for instance one 30&nbsp;mm long or 25 mm long which may be flat on the front or slightly pointed in order to get into hard to reach spots, for instance under window brick work and in corners. These shorter length tuckpointing tools are called \"stubnose\" and \"longnose\" tuckpointing tools respectively and they are now available in many different \"beaded\" or grooved profiles. As the names suggest, the stubnose is shorter in height while the longnose is longer.\n\nTools are sometimes \"beaded\". Beaded tuckpointing tools were first crudely made by blacksmiths by hitting a rounded leading edged hammer against a red hot tuckpointing iron. This process has now been refined and now a small rounded or square fillet is \"ground\" into the flat of the tuckpointing tool that comes into contact with the \"perps\" or \"lines\" in the brickwork.

They are available in Standard and Beaded profiles so that rounded bricks can be tuckpointed.\n\nThe process of tuckpointing requires that the excess lime putty is \"cut\" away from the fine tuckpointed line. This is performed using a Frenchmen<ref name=\":0\" /> knife or a double Frenchmen knife. A Frenchmen knife is a type of knife with a small sharp bent tip which allows the lime putty to be cut when guided along the tuckpointed line with a tuckpointer's straight edge.

These catalogues remain available, ranging in price from $5 for average quality used copy to $900 for numbered, limited edition catalogues signed by the artist(s). This practice reflected the Lejwas' loyalty to their artists and desire to see their artists' reputations and art established and available beyond the gallery's walls.  From a business perspective, this attention to the \"secondary\" art marketn(the resale of art following its original acquisition from the artist), contributed to their increased stature as a gallery throughout the 1960s.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/35961037/The_loyal_underdog._Observations_on_Hans_Arp_and_Galerie_Chalette Hartog, Aria ''The loyal underdog.

These catalogues remain available, ranging in price from $5 for average quality used copy to $900 for numbered, limited edition catalogues signed by the artist(s). This practice reflected the Lejwas' loyalty to their artists and desire to see their artists' reputations and art established and available beyond the gallery's walls.  From a business perspective, this attention to the \"secondary\" art marketn(the resale of art following its original acquisition from the artist), contributed to their increased stature as a gallery throughout the 1960s.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/35961037/The_loyal_underdog._Observations_on_Hans_Arp_and_Galerie_Chalette Hartog, Aria ''The loyal underdog.

He started studies in journalism at the German Political College, but the [[Nazi Party]] instituted restrictions on Jews and banned them from colleges. Capa relocated to Paris, where he adopted the name 'Robert Capa' in 1934. At that time, he had already been a hobby-photographer.\n\nIn 1934 \"Andr\u00e9 Friedman\", as he still called himself then, met Gerda Pohorylle, a German Jewish refugee. The couple lived in Paris where Andr\u00e9 taught Gerda photography. Together they created the name and image of \"Robert Capa\" as a famous American photographer, and at the beginning of the war both photographers published their work under the pseudonym of Robert Capa.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.eldiario.es/cultura/fenomenos/Gerda-Taro-Robert-Capa-seudonimo_0_732126905.html|title=Gerda Taro, Robert Capa y los peligros de firmar con un seud\u00f3nimo masculino|work=eldiario.es|access-date=2018-01-23|language=es}}</ref> Gerda took the name Gerda Taro and became successful in her own right.

He founded the International Fund for Concerned Photography in 1966. To give this collection a permanent home, he founded the [[International Center of Photography]] in New York City in 1974. This was one of the foremost and most extensive conservation efforts on photography to be developed. Indeed, Capa and his brother believed strongly in the importance of photography and its preservation, much like film would later be perceived and duly treated in a similar way.\nThe [[Overseas Press Club]] created the [[Robert Capa Gold Medal]] in the photographer's honor.<ref>[http://www.opcofamerica.org/opc_awards/archive/byaward/award_capa.php ''Overseas Press Club of America'', Awards Archive.] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20071105202454/http://www.opcofamerica.org/opc_awards/archive/byaward/award_capa.php |date=November 5, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nCapa is known for redefining wartime photojournalism.

He was the son of [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor]], and [[Agnes of Poitou]]. After his father's death on 5&nbsp;October 1056, Henry was placed under his mother's guardianship. She made grants to German aristocrats to secure their support. Unlike her late husband, she could not control the election of the popes, thus the idea of the [[Libertas ecclesiae|''libertas ecclesiae'']] (freedom of the Church) strengthened during her rule. Taking advantage of her weakness, Archbishop [[Anno II of Cologne]] kidnapped Henry in April 1062. He administered Germany until Henry came of age in 1065.\n\nHenry decided to recover the royal estates that had been lost during his minority. He employed low-ranking officials to carry out his new policies, causing discontent in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Duchy of Thuringia|Thuringia]]. Henry crushed a riot in Saxony in 1069 and overcame the rebellion of the Saxon aristocrat, [[Otto of Nordheim]] in 1071. The appointment of commoners to high offices offended German aristocrats, and many of them withdrew from Henry's court. He insisted on his royal prerogatives relating to the appointment of bishops and abbots, although the reformist clerics condemned this practice as [[simony]] (a forbidden sale of church offices). [[Pope Alexander II]] blamed Henry's advisors for his acts and excommunicated them in early 1073. Henry's conflicts with the [[Holy See]] and the German dukes weakened his position and the [[Saxon Rebellion]] continued in the summer of 1074. He took advantage of a rift between the Saxon aristocrats and peasantry and forced the rebels into submission in October 1075.\n\nHenry adopted an active policy in Italy, alarming [[Pope Gregory VII]] who threatened him with excommunication for simony. Henry persuaded most of the German bishops to declare the Pope's election invalid on 24&nbsp;January 1076. In response, the Pope excommunicated Henry and released his subjects from their allegiance. To prevent the Pope from sitting in judgement on him at the German leaders' assembly, Henry went to Italy. However, his penitential \"[[Walk to Canossa]]\" was a success and Gregory&nbsp;VII had no choice but to absolve him in January 1077. Henry's German opponents ignored his absolution and elected an [[antiking]], [[Rudolf of Rheinfelden]], on 14&nbsp;March 1077. The Pope was initially neutral in the two kings' conflict, enabling Henry to consolidate his position. Henry continued to appoint high-ranking clerics, for which the Pope again excommunicated him on 7&nbsp;March 1080. Most German and Lombardian bishops remained loyal to Henry and they elected the antipope [[Antipope Clement III|Clement&nbsp;III]]. Rudolf of Rheinfelden was killed in battle and his successor, [[Hermann of Salm]], could only exert royal authority in Saxony. From 1081, Henry launched a series of military campaigns to Italy, and Clement&nbsp;III crowned him emperor in Rome on 1&nbsp;April 1084.\n\nHermann of Salm died and Henry pacified Saxony with the local aristocrats' assistance in 1088. He launched an invasion against the pope's principal Italian ally, [[Matilda of Tuscany]], in 1089. She convinced Henry's elder son, [[Conrad II of Italy|Conrad]] II, to take up arms against his father in 1093. Her alliance with [[Welf I, Duke of Bavaria]] prevented Henry's return to Germany until 1096 when he was reconciled with Welf. After Clement&nbsp;III's death, Henry did not support new antipopes, but he did not make peace with [[Pope Paschal II]]. Henry proclaimed the first ''[[Landfrieden]]'' (or, imperial peace) which covered the whole territory of Germany in 1103. His younger son, [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry&nbsp;V]], forced him to abdicate on 31&nbsp;December 1105.

Consequently, polemical literature tended to provide a list of the characteristics of either good or wicked rulers when portraying Henry. For instance, in the 1080s, the ''[[Song of the Saxon War]]'' praised him as a \"king second to none in his piety\" who defended the widows and the poor and gave laws to the lawless Saxons. An anonymous biography, completed in the early 1110s, described him as a vigorous and warlike monarch who employed learned officials and enjoyed conversations about spiritual themes and the [[liberal arts]].

He was the son of [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor]], and [[Agnes of Poitou]]. After his father's death on 5&nbsp;October 1056, Henry was placed under his mother's guardianship. She made grants to German aristocrats to secure their support. Unlike her late husband, she could not control the election of the popes, thus the idea of the [[Libertas ecclesiae|''libertas ecclesiae'']] (freedom of the Church) strengthened during her rule. Taking advantage of her weakness, Archbishop [[Anno II of Cologne]] kidnapped Henry in April 1062. He administered Germany until Henry came of age in 1065.\n\nHenry decided to recover the royal estates that had been lost during his minority. He employed low-ranking officials to carry out his new policies, causing discontent in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Duchy of Thuringia|Thuringia]]. Henry crushed a riot in Saxony in 1069 and overcame the rebellion of the Saxon aristocrat, [[Otto of Nordheim]] in 1071. The appointment of commoners to high offices offended German aristocrats, and many of them withdrew from Henry's court. He insisted on his royal prerogatives relating to the appointment of bishops and abbots, although the reformist clerics condemned this practice as [[simony]] (a forbidden sale of church offices). [[Pope Alexander II]] blamed Henry's advisors for his acts and excommunicated them in early 1073. Henry's conflicts with the [[Holy See]] and the German dukes weakened his position and the [[Saxon Rebellion]] continued in the summer of 1074. He took advantage of a rift between the Saxon aristocrats and peasantry and forced the rebels into submission in October 1075.\n\nHenry adopted an active policy in Italy, alarming [[Pope Gregory VII]] who threatened him with excommunication for simony. Henry persuaded most of the German bishops to declare the Pope's election invalid on 24&nbsp;January 1076. In response, the Pope excommunicated Henry and released his subjects from their allegiance. To prevent the Pope from sitting in judgement on him at the German leaders' assembly, Henry went to Italy. His penitential \"[[Walk to Canossa]]\" was a success. Gregory&nbsp;VII had no choice but to absolve him in January 1077. Henry's German opponents ignored his absolution and elected an [[antiking]], [[Rudolf of Rheinfelden]], on 14&nbsp;March 1077. The Pope was initially neutral in the two kings' conflict, enabling Henry to consolidate his position. Henry continued to appoint high-ranking clerics, for which the Pope again excommunicated him on 7&nbsp;March 1080. Most German and Lombardian bishops remained loyal to Henry and they elected the antipope [[Antipope Clement III|Clement&nbsp;III]]. Rudolf of Rheinfelden was killed in battle and his successor, [[Hermann of Salm]], could only exert royal authority in Saxony. From 1081, Henry launched a series of military campaigns to Italy, and Clement&nbsp;III crowned him emperor in Rome on 1&nbsp;April 1084.\n\nHermann of Salm died and Henry pacified Saxony with the local aristocrats' assistance in 1088. He launched an invasion against the pope's principal Italian ally, [[Matilda of Tuscany]], in 1089. She convinced Henry's elder son, [[Conrad II of Italy|Conrad]] II, to take up arms against his father in 1093. Her alliance with [[Welf I, Duke of Bavaria]] prevented Henry's return to Germany until 1096 when he was reconciled with Welf. After Clement&nbsp;III's death, Henry did not support new antipopes, but he did not make peace with [[Pope Paschal II]]. Henry proclaimed the first ''[[Landfrieden]]'' (or, imperial peace) which covered the whole territory of Germany in 1103. His younger son, [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry&nbsp;V]], forced him to abdicate on 31&nbsp;December 1105. He tried to regain his throne with the assistance of Lotharingian aristocrats, but became ill and died without receiving absolution from his excommunication.\n\n==Background==\n\nHenry was the third monarch of the [[Salian dynasty]]\u2014the royal house ruling [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]] from 1024 to 1124.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=113}} The 11th-century kings of Germany also ruled [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italy]] and [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundy]] and had a strong claim to the title of emperor. They were convinced that their claim to the emperorship entitled them to act as all Christians' paramount rulers and to control [[Papal selection before 1059|papal elections]] in Rome.{{sfn|Barber|2004|pp=197\u2013198}} Rome was actually dominated by local aristocrats, the [[Counts of Tusculum|Tusculani]] and the [[Crescentii]], who placed their own candidates to the papal throne.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|pp=43\u201344}} Their rivalries caused scandals, culminating when rival popes\u2014[[Pope Benedict&nbsp;IX|Benedict&nbsp;IX]], [[Pope Sylvester III|Sylvester&nbsp;III]] and [[Pope Gregory VI|Gregory&nbsp;VI]]\u2014competed for Rome in 1045.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=44}}{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=56}} To put an end to the schism, Henry's father, [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry&nbsp;III]], crossed the [[Alps]] to Italy and held a [[Council of Sutri|Church synod at Sutri]] on 20 December 1046.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=113}} The synod deposed the three popes and replaced them with a German prelate, Bishop Suidger of Bamberg, who assumed the name [[Pope Clement II|Clement II]].{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=57}}\n\nHenry&nbsp;III emphasized the priestly nature of kingship, attributing it to the kings' annointment by holy oil.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=39}} For all his personal piety, he regarded himself as \"[[Vicar of Christ]]\", authorized to administer state and church alike.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=49}} The Romans awarded him with the hereditary title of patrician, acknowledging his and his successors' right to cast the first vote at papal elections.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=128}} His new title enabled him to exlude the Roman aristocrats from influencing papal elections and to secure the appointment of German clerics to the papal throne.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=45}} The third German pope, [[Pope Leo IX|Leo&nbsp;IX]], came from [[Lotharingia]]\u2014a province that had been an important center of reformist clerics. They wanted to purify the Church through the re-implementation of ancient (or supposedly ancient) collections of [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|canon law]] and Leo&nbsp;IX enthusiastically introduced their ideas in Rome. He prohibited simony\u2014the sale of Church offices\u2014and promoted [[Clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church|clerical celibacy]] soon after his entry to Rome.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|pp=64\u201365, 70\u201374}}\n\nHenry&nbsp;III's claim to intervene in Church affairs was rarely challenged: reformist bishops convinced him not to extract an oath of fealty from the monk [[Halinard]] who had been elected [[archbishop of Lyon]] in 1045; Bishop [[Wazo of Li\u00e8ge]] openly denied his right to depose bishops in 1047 or 1048.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=49}}{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|pp=52\u201353}} Imperial control of Church affairs, however, was on the long run incompatible with the reformist idea of \"liberty of the Church\" which claimed that ecclesiastic institutions could only be subject to the authority of the Holy See. The conflict between the two ideas reached its pinnacle during Henry IV's reign, developing into the confrontation known as the [[Investiture Controversy]].{{sfn|Barber|2004|pp=87\u201391}}\n\nGermany, Italy and Burgundy were no more than collections of semi-independent territories, each administered by a prelate or a lay aristocrat, under the Salian monarchs.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=2}} The prelates\u2014the bishops and abbots\u2014were not only wealthy landowners, but they also played an important role in state administration. They were required to make annual gifts to the kings and also to provide the monarchs with well-defined regular services, including the collection of taxes and hospitality.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=36}} The dukes were the most powerful lay aristocrats in Germany. They were primarily military commanders, but they were also responsible for the administration of justice. The dukes were the principal representatives of the people of their duchies in the royal court, but the monarchs expected the dukes to be primarily their agents.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=2\u20133}} The monarchs occasionally kept the office of duke for themselves or for their closest relatives, but sooner or later they had no choice, but to give away the vacant duchies, because they depended on the most powerful aristocrats' support.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=41}}\n\nHenry&nbsp;III came into conflict with influential dukes towards the end of his life. [[Godfrey the Bearded]], [[Duke of Upper Lotharingia]], married a wealthy widow, [[Beatrice of Lorraine|Beatrice of Tuscany]], without the Emperor's consent after the Emperor denied to invest him with whole Lotharingia.

Consequently, polemical literature tended to provide a list of the characteristics of either good or wicked rulers when portraying Henry. For instance, in the 1080s, the ''[[Song of the Saxon War]]'' praised him as a \"king second to none in his piety\" who defended the widows and the poor and gave laws to the lawless Saxons. An anonymous biography, completed in the early 1110s, described him as a vigorous and warlike monarch who employed learned officials and enjoyed conversations about spiritual themes and the [[liberal arts]].
