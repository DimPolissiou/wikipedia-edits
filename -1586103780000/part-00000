Grant series}}\n\n'''Ulysses S. Grant''' (born '''Hiram Ulysses Grant'''; April 27, 1822{{spaced ndash}}July 23, 1885) was an American soldier and politician who served as the 18th [[president of the United States]] from 1869 to 1877. Before his presidency, Grant led the [[Union Army]] as [[Commanding General of the United States Army]] in winning the [[American Civil War]]. As president, Grant worked with the [[Radical Republicans]] in the [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] of the Union while having to deal with corruption in his administration.\n\nRaised in [[Ohio]], young Grant possessed an [[Horsemanship of Ulysses S. Grant|exceptional ability]] with horses, which served him well through his military career. He was admitted to [[West Point]] and graduated from the U.S. military academy in 1843. Grant served with distinction in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. In 1848, he married [[Julia Grant|Julia Dent]], and together they had four children. Grant abruptly resigned his army commission in 1854 and returned to his family, but lived in poverty for seven years. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], he joined the [[Union Army]] in 1861, and led the [[Vicksburg campaign]], which gained control of the [[Mississippi River]] in 1863. After Grant's victory at [[Chattanooga campaign|Chattanooga]], President [[Abraham Lincoln]] promoted Grant to [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]]. For thirteen months, Grant fought [[Robert E. Lee]] during the high casualty [[Overland Campaign]] and at [[Siege of Petersburg|Petersburg]]. On April 9, 1865, Lee surrendered to Grant at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House#Surrender|Appomattox]]. A week later, [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln was assassinated]], and was succeeded by President [[Andrew Johnson]], who promoted Grant to [[General of the Army (United States)#Post\u2013American Civil War era|General of the Army]] in 1866. Later Grant openly broke with Johnson over Reconstruction policies; Grant used the reconstruction acts, which had been passed over Johnson's veto, to enforce civil rights for African [[freedmen]].\n\nA war hero but a reluctant politician, Grant was unanimously nominated by the Republican Party and was elected president in 1868. As president, Grant stabilized the post-war national economy, created the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], and prosecuted the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. He appointed [[African-Americans]] and [[Jewish-Americans]] to prominent federal offices. In 1871, he created the first [[United States Civil Service Commission|Civil Service Commission]]. The [[Liberal Republicans]] and [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democrats]] united behind Grant's opponent in the presidential election of 1872, but Grant was handily re-elected. Grant's Native American policy had both successes and failures. In foreign affairs, the Grant administration peacefully resolved the [[Alabama Claims|''Alabama'' claims]] against Great Britain, but the Senate rejected Grant's prized Caribbean [[Annexation of Santo Domingo|Dominican Republic annexation]]. Corruption in the executive branch became notorious: several of Grant's cabinet members and other appointees were fired or had to resign. The [[Panic of 1873]] plunged the nation into a severe economic depression, that allowed the Democrats to win the House majority. In the intensely disputed Presidential [[1876 United States presidential election|election of 1876]], Grant facilitated the approval by Congress of a peaceful compromise.\n\nIn his retirement, Grant was the first president to circumnavigate the world on his [[World tour of Ulysses S. Grant|tour]] meeting with many foreign leaders. In 1880, Grant was unsuccessful in obtaining the Republican presidential nomination for a third term. In the final year of his life, facing severe financial reversals and dying of throat cancer, he wrote [[Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant|his memoirs]], which proved to be a major critical and financial success. At the time of his death, he was memorialized as a symbol of national unity.\n\nHistorians have recognized Grant's military genius, and [[Ulysses S. Grant and the American Civil War|his modern strategies]] of warfare are featured in military history textbooks. [[Historical reputation of Ulysses S. Grant|Historical assessments]] of Grant's presidency have improved over time. Grant was [[historical rankings of presidents of the United States|ranked]] 38th in 1994 and 1996, but ranked 21st in 2018. Historians have emphasized Grant's presidential accomplishments including the [[Alabama Claims]] settlement, protection of [[African Americans|Blacks]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]], and the first Civil Service Commission.\n\n==Early life and education==\n{{Further|Early life and career of Ulysses S.

''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'', 1880]]\n\n[[Stalwarts]], led by Grant's old political ally, [[Roscoe Conkling]], saw Grant's renewed popularity as an opportunity to regain power, and sought to nominate him for the presidency in [[1880 United States presidential election|1880]]. Opponents called it a violation of the unofficial two-term rule in use since George Washington. Grant said nothing publicly but wanted the job and encouraged his men.{{sfn|Hesseltine|1957|pp=432\u2013439}} Washburne urged him to run; Grant demurred, saying he would be happy for the Republicans to win with another candidate, though he preferred [[James G.

When [[1880 Republican National Convention|the convention]] convened in Chicago in June, there were more delegates pledged to Grant than to any other candidate, but he was still short of a majority vote to get the nomination.{{sfn|Brands|2012|pp=600\u2013601}}\n\nAt the convention, Conkling nominated Grant with an eloquent speech, the most famous line being: \"When asked which state he hails from, our sole reply shall be, he hails from Appomattox and its famous apple tree.\"{{sfn|Brands|2012|pp=600\u2013601}} With 370 votes needed for nomination, the first ballot had Grant at 304, Blaine at 284, Sherman at 93, and the rest to minor candidates.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=479\u2013481}} Subsequent ballots followed, with roughly the same result; neither Grant nor Blaine could win. After thirty-six ballots, Blaine's delegates deserted him and combined with those of other candidates to nominate a compromise candidate: Representative [[James A. Garfield]] of Ohio.{{sfn|Brands|2012|p=602}} A procedural motion made the vote unanimous for Garfield, who accepted the nomination.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=617}} Grant gave speeches for Garfield but declined to criticize the Democratic nominee, [[Winfield Scott Hancock]], a general who had served under him in the Army of the Potomac.{{sfn|Brands|2012|pp=604\u2013605}} Garfield won the election. Grant gave Garfield his public support and pushed him to include Stalwarts in his administration.{{sfn|Brands|2012|pp=607\u2013609}} On July 2, 1881, Garfield was shot by an assassin and died on September 19. On learning of Garfield's death from a reporter, Grant wept bitterly.{{sfn|Brands|2012|pp=613\u2013614}}\n\n===Business failures===\nWhen Grant had returned to America from his costly world tour, he had depleted most of his savings and needed to earn money and find a new home.{{sfn|Brands|2012|p=611}} Wealthy friends bought him a home on Manhattan's [[Upper East Side]], and to make an income, Grant, Jay Gould, and former Mexican Finance Secretary [[Mat\u00edas Romero]] chartered the [[Mexican Southern Railroad]], with plans to build a railroad from Oaxaca to Mexico City. Grant urged [[Chester A. Arthur]], who had succeeded Garfield as president in 1881, to negotiate a free trade treaty with Mexico. Arthur and the Mexican government agreed, but the United States Senate rejected the treaty in 1883. The railroad was similarly unsuccessful, falling into bankruptcy the following year.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=486\u2013489}}\n\nAt the same time, Grant's son Buck had opened a Wall Street brokerage house with [[Ferdinand Ward]]\u2014although a confidence man who swindled numerous wealthy men, Ward was at the time regarded as a rising star on Wall Street. The firm, Grant & Ward, was initially successful.{{sfnm|McFeely|1981|1pp=488\u2013491|Ward|2012}} In 1883, Grant joined the firm and invested $100,000 of his own money.{{sfn|Brands|2012|p=619}} Grant, however, warned Ward that if his firm engaged in government business he would dissolve their partnership.{{sfn|Chernow|2017|pp=917\u2013918}} To encourage investment, Ward paid investors abnormally high interest, by pledging the company's securities on multiple loans in a process called ''[[rehypothecation]]''.{{sfnm|McFeely|1981|1pp=488\u2013491|White|2016|2p=269}} Ward, in collusion with banker James D.

In May 1884, enough investments went bad to convince Ward that the firm would soon be bankrupt. Ward, who assumed Grant was \"a child in business matters,\"{{sfn|Chernow|2017|pp=917}} told him of the impending failure, but assured Grant that this was a temporary shortfall.{{sfnm|Brands|2012|1pp=620\u2013621|White|2016|2pp=627\u2013629}} Grant approached businessman [[William Henry Vanderbilt]], who gave him a personal loan of $150,000.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=492\u2013493}} Grant invested the money in the firm, but it was not enough to save it from failure. Essentially penniless, but compelled by a sense of personal honor, he repaid what he could with his Civil War mementos and the sale or transfer of all other assets.{{sfn|Perry|2004|p=xxix}} Vanderbilt took title to Grant's home, although he allowed the Grants to continue to reside there, and pledged to donate the souvenirs to the federal government and insisted the debt had been paid in full.{{sfnm|White|2016|1pp=632\u2013633|Brands|2012|2pp=620\u2013621}} Grant was distraught over Ward's deception and asked privately how he could ever \"trust any human being again.\"{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=621}}\n\nIn March 1885, as his health was failing, he testified against both Ward and Fish.{{sfnm|Badeau|1887|1p=447|2a1=Mackowski|2a2=White|2y=2015|2p=169}} Ward was convicted of [[grand larceny|fraud]] in October 1885, months after Grant's death, and served six and a half years in prison.{{sfn|Brands|2012|pp=620\u2013621}} After the collapse of Grant & Ward, there was an outpouring of sympathy for Grant.{{sfn|Chernow|2017|pp=925\u2013926}}\n\n===Memoirs, pension, and death===\n{{stack|[[File:US Grant in 1885.jpg|thumb|alt=Grant sitting in a porch chair wrapped in blankets| Grant worked on his memoirs in June 1885, less than a month before his death.

By contrast his ''Memoirs'' are highly critical of the political aspects, condemning the war as unwarranted aggression by the United States. Grant told and retold his war stories so many times that writing his ''Memoirs'' was more a matter of repetition and polish rather than trying to recall his memories for the first time.{{sfn|Ferraro|2019}}{{efn|To restore his family's income and reputation, Grant wrote several articles on his Civil War campaigns for ''[[The Century Magazine]]'' at $500 ({{Inflation|US|500|1885|r=-3|fmt=eq}}) each. The articles were well received by critics, and the editor, [[Robert Underwood Johnson]], suggested that Grant write a book of memoirs, as Sherman and others had done. Grant's articles would serve as the basis for several chapters.{{sfnm|McFeely|1981|p=494}}}}\n\nIn the summer of 1884, Grant complained of a sore throat but put off seeing a doctor until late October, when he learned it was cancer, possibly caused by his frequent cigar smoking.{{sfnm|White|2016|1p=636|Waugh|2009|2p=277}}{{efn|Today, medical historians believed he suffered from a T<sub>1</sub>N<sub>1</sub> [[carcinoma]] of the [[tonsillar fossa]].{{sfn|Renehan|Lowry|1995|pp=377\u2013383}}}} Grant chose not to reveal the seriousness of his condition to his wife, who soon found out from Grant's doctor.{{sfn|White|2016|p=637}} Before being diagnosed, Grant was invited to a Methodist service for Civil War veterans in [[Ocean Grove, New Jersey]], on August 4, 1884, receiving a standing ovation from more than ten thousand veterans and others; it would be his last public appearance.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=495\u2013496}} In March of the following year, ''[[The New York Times]]'' announced that Grant was dying of cancer, and a nationwide public concern for the former president began.{{sfnm|Brands|2012|1pp=622\u201362|Smith|2001|2p=625}}{{efn|Knowing of Grant and Julia's financial difficulties, Congress sought to honor him and restored him to the rank of General of the Army with full retirement pay\u2014Grant's assumption of the presidency in 1869 had required that he resign his commission and forfeit his (and his widow's) pension.{{sfnm|Smith|2001|1p=625|White|2016|2p=641}}}}\n\nGrant was nearly broke and worried constantly about leaving his wife a suitable amount of money to live on.

Grant series}}\n\n'''Ulysses S. Grant''' (born '''Hiram Ulysses Grant'''; April 27, 1822{{spaced ndash}}July 23, 1885) was an American soldier and politician who served as the 18th [[president of the United States]] from 1869 to 1877. Before his presidency, Grant led the [[Union Army]] as [[Commanding General of the United States Army]] in winning the [[American Civil War]]. As president, Grant worked with the [[Radical Republicans]] in the [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] of the Union while having to deal with corruption in his administration.\n\nRaised in [[Ohio]], young Grant possessed an [[Horsemanship of Ulysses S. Grant|exceptional ability]] with horses, which served him well through his military career. He was admitted to [[West Point]] and graduated from the U.S. military academy in 1843. Grant served with distinction in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. In 1848, he married [[Julia Grant|Julia Dent]], and together they had four children. Grant abruptly resigned his army commission in 1854 and returned to his family, but lived in poverty for seven years. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], he joined the [[Union Army]] in 1861, and led the [[Vicksburg campaign]], which gained control of the [[Mississippi River]] in 1863. After Grant's victory at [[Chattanooga campaign|Chattanooga]], President [[Abraham Lincoln]] promoted Grant to [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]]. For thirteen months, Grant fought [[Robert E. Lee]] during the high casualty [[Overland Campaign]] and at [[Siege of Petersburg|Petersburg]]. On April 9, 1865, Lee surrendered to Grant at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House#Surrender|Appomattox]]. A week later, [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln was assassinated]], and was succeeded by President [[Andrew Johnson]], who promoted Grant to [[General of the Army (United States)#Post\u2013American Civil War era|General of the Army]] in 1866. Later Grant openly broke with Johnson over Reconstruction policies; Grant used the reconstruction acts, which had been passed over Johnson's veto, to enforce civil rights for African [[freedmen]].\n\nA war hero but a reluctant politician, Grant was unanimously nominated by the Republican Party and was elected president in 1868. As president, Grant stabilized the post-war national economy, created the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]], and prosecuted the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. He appointed [[African-Americans]] and [[Jewish-Americans]] to prominent federal offices. In 1871, he created the first [[United States Civil Service Commission|Civil Service Commission]]. The [[Liberal Republicans]] and [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democrats]] united behind Grant's opponent in the presidential election of 1872, but Grant was handily re-elected. Grant's Native American policy had both successes and failures. In foreign affairs, the Grant administration peacefully resolved the [[Alabama Claims|''Alabama'' claims]] against Great Britain, but the Senate rejected Grant's prized Caribbean [[Annexation of Santo Domingo|Dominican Republic annexation]]. Corruption in the executive branch became notorious: several of Grant's cabinet members and other appointees were fired or had to resign. The [[Panic of 1873]] plunged the nation into a severe economic depression, that allowed the Democrats to win the House majority. In the intensely disputed Presidential [[1876 United States presidential election|election of 1876]], Grant facilitated the approval by Congress of a peaceful compromise.\n\nIn his retirement, Grant was the first president to circumnavigate the world on his [[World tour of Ulysses S. Grant|tour]] meeting with many foreign leaders. In 1880, Grant was unsuccessful in obtaining the Republican presidential nomination for a third term. In the final year of his life, facing severe financial reversals and dying of throat cancer, he wrote [[Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant|his memoirs]], which proved to be a major critical and financial success. At the time of his death, he was memorialized as a symbol of national unity.\n\nHistorians have recognized Grant's military genius, and [[Ulysses S. Grant and the American Civil War|his modern strategies]] of warfare are featured in military history textbooks. [[Historical reputation of Ulysses S. Grant|Historical assessments]] of Grant's presidency have improved over time. Grant was [[historical rankings of presidents of the United States|ranked]] 38th in 1994 and 1996, but ranked 21st in 2018. Historians have emphasized Grant's presidential accomplishments including the [[Alabama Claims]] settlement, protection of [[African Americans|Blacks]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]], and the first Civil Service Commission.\n\n==Early life and education==\n{{Further|Early life and career of Ulysses S.

Despite  political differences with Jesse Root Grant, Hamer, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], nominated his 17-year-old son to West Point in Spring 1839.{{sfn|White|2016|pp=24\u201325}} Grant was accepted on July 1, although he doubted his academic abilities.{{sfnm|White|2016|1pp=25, 43|Cullum|1891|2pp=170\u2013171|Simpson|2014|3pp=10\u201311}} Hamer, unfamiliar with Grant, submitted an incorrect name to West Point.

''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'', 1880]]\n\n[[Stalwarts]], led by Grant's old political ally, [[Roscoe Conkling]], saw Grant's renewed popularity as an opportunity to regain power, and sought to nominate him for the presidency in [[1880 United States presidential election|1880]]. Opponents called it a violation of the unofficial two-term rule in use since George Washington. Grant said nothing publicly but wanted the job and encouraged his men.{{sfn|Hesseltine|1957|pp=432\u2013439}} Washburne urged him to run; Grant demurred, saying he would be happy for the Republicans to win with another candidate, though he preferred [[James G.

When [[1880 Republican National Convention|the convention]] convened in Chicago in June, there were more delegates pledged to Grant than to any other candidate, but he was still short of a majority vote to get the nomination.{{sfn|Brands|2012|pp=600\u2013601}}\n\nAt the convention, Conkling nominated Grant with an eloquent speech, the most famous line being: \"When asked which state he hails from, our sole reply shall be, he hails from Appomattox and its famous apple tree.\"{{sfn|Brands|2012|pp=600\u2013601}} With 370 votes needed for nomination, the first ballot had Grant at 304, Blaine at 284, Sherman at 93, and the rest to minor candidates.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=479\u2013481}} Subsequent ballots followed, with roughly the same result; neither Grant nor Blaine could win. After thirty-six ballots, Blaine's delegates deserted him and combined with those of other candidates to nominate a compromise candidate: Representative [[James A. Garfield]] of Ohio.{{sfn|Brands|2012|p=602}} A procedural motion made the vote unanimous for Garfield, who accepted the nomination.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=617}} Grant gave speeches for Garfield but declined to criticize the Democratic nominee, [[Winfield Scott Hancock]], a general who had served under him in the Army of the Potomac.{{sfn|Brands|2012|pp=604\u2013605}} Garfield won the election. Grant gave Garfield his public support and pushed him to include Stalwarts in his administration.{{sfn|Brands|2012|pp=607\u2013609}} On July 2, 1881, Garfield was shot by an assassin and died on September 19. On learning of Garfield's death from a reporter, Grant wept bitterly.{{sfn|Brands|2012|pp=613\u2013614}}\n\n===Business failures===\nWhen Grant had returned to America from his costly world tour, he had depleted most of his savings and needed to earn money and find a new home.{{sfn|Brands|2012|p=611}} Wealthy friends bought him a home on Manhattan's [[Upper East Side]], and to make an income, Grant, Jay Gould, and former Mexican Finance Secretary [[Mat\u00edas Romero]] chartered the [[Mexican Southern Railroad]], with plans to build a railroad from Oaxaca to Mexico City. Grant urged [[Chester A. Arthur]], who had succeeded Garfield as president in 1881, to negotiate a free trade treaty with Mexico. Arthur and the Mexican government agreed, but the United States Senate rejected the treaty in 1883. The railroad was similarly unsuccessful, falling into bankruptcy the following year.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=486\u2013489}}\n\nAt the same time, Grant's son Buck had opened a Wall Street brokerage house with [[Ferdinand Ward]]\u2014although a confidence man who swindled numerous wealthy men, Ward was at the time regarded as a rising star on Wall Street. The firm, Grant & Ward, was initially successful.{{sfnm|McFeely|1981|1pp=488\u2013491|Ward|2012}} In 1883, Grant joined the firm and invested $100,000 of his own money.{{sfn|Brands|2012|p=619}} Grant, however, warned Ward that if his firm engaged in government business he would dissolve their partnership.{{sfn|Chernow|2017|pp=917\u2013918}} To encourage investment, Ward paid investors abnormally high interest, by pledging the company's securities on multiple loans in a process called ''[[rehypothecation]]''.{{sfnm|McFeely|1981|1pp=488\u2013491|White|2016|2p=269}} Ward, in collusion with banker James D.

In May 1884, enough investments went bad to convince Ward that the firm would soon be bankrupt. Ward, who assumed Grant was \"a child in business matters,\"{{sfn|Chernow|2017|pp=917}} told him of the impending failure, but assured Grant that this was a temporary shortfall.{{sfnm|Brands|2012|1pp=620\u2013621|White|2016|2pp=627\u2013629}} Grant approached businessman [[William Henry Vanderbilt]], who gave him a personal loan of $150,000.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=492\u2013493}} Grant invested the money in the firm, but it was not enough to save it from failure. Essentially penniless, but compelled by a sense of personal honor, he repaid what he could with his Civil War mementos and the sale or transfer of all other assets.{{sfn|Perry|2004|p=xxix}} Vanderbilt took title to Grant's home, although he allowed the Grants to continue to reside there, and pledged to donate the souvenirs to the federal government and insisted the debt had been paid in full.{{sfnm|White|2016|1pp=632\u2013633|Brands|2012|2pp=620\u2013621}} Grant was distraught over Ward's deception and asked privately how he could ever \"trust any human being again.\"{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=621}}\n\nIn March 1885, as his health was failing, he testified against both Ward and Fish.{{sfnm|Badeau|1887|1p=447|2a1=Mackowski|2a2=White|2y=2015|2p=169}} Ward was convicted of [[grand larceny|fraud]] in October 1885, months after Grant's death, and served six and a half years in prison.{{sfn|Brands|2012|pp=620\u2013621}} After the collapse of Grant & Ward, there was an outpouring of sympathy for Grant.{{sfn|Chernow|2017|pp=925\u2013926}}\n\n===Memoirs, pension, and death===\n{{stack|[[File:US Grant in 1885.jpg|thumb|alt=Grant sitting in a porch chair wrapped in blankets| Grant worked on his memoirs in June 1885, less than a month before his death.

By contrast his ''Memoirs'' are highly critical of the political aspects, condemning the war as unwarranted aggression by the United States. Grant told and retold his war stories so many times that writing his ''Memoirs'' was more a matter of repetition and polish rather than trying to recall his memories for the first time.{{sfn|Ferraro|2019}}{{efn|To restore his family's income and reputation, Grant wrote several articles on his Civil War campaigns for ''[[The Century Magazine]]'' at $500 ({{Inflation|US|500|1885|r=-3|fmt=eq}}) each. The articles were well received by critics, and the editor, [[Robert Underwood Johnson]], suggested that Grant write a book of memoirs, as Sherman and others had done. Grant's articles would serve as the basis for several chapters.{{sfnm|McFeely|1981|p=494}}}}\n\nIn the summer of 1884, Grant complained of a sore throat but put off seeing a doctor until late October, when he learned it was cancer, possibly caused by his frequent cigar smoking.{{sfnm|White|2016|1p=636|Waugh|2009|2p=277}}{{efn|Today, medical historians believed he suffered from a T<sub>1</sub>N<sub>1</sub> [[carcinoma]] of the [[tonsillar fossa]].{{sfn|Renehan|Lowry|1995|pp=377\u2013383}}}} Grant chose not to reveal the seriousness of his condition to his wife, who soon found out from Grant's doctor.{{sfn|White|2016|p=637}} Before being diagnosed, Grant was invited to a Methodist service for Civil War veterans in [[Ocean Grove, New Jersey]], on August 4, 1884, receiving a standing ovation from more than ten thousand veterans and others; it would be his last public appearance.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=495\u2013496}} In March of the following year, ''[[The New York Times]]'' announced that Grant was dying of cancer, and a nationwide public concern for the former president began.{{sfnm|Brands|2012|1pp=622\u201362|Smith|2001|2p=625}}{{efn|Knowing of Grant and Julia's financial difficulties, Congress sought to honor him and restored him to the rank of General of the Army with full retirement pay\u2014Grant's assumption of the presidency in 1869 had required that he resign his commission and forfeit his (and his widow's) pension.{{sfnm|Smith|2001|1p=625|White|2016|2p=641}}}}\n\nGrant was nearly broke and worried constantly about leaving his wife a suitable amount of money to live on.

Utsukushi-ga-hara Open Air Museum, Japan.jpg|thumb|Reaching sculpture with Zenos Frudakis at the Utsukushi-ga-hara Open Air Museum in Japan.]]\n\n\n\n== Biography ==\nZenos' father, born in [[Greece]], came to the U.S. as a boy. The oldest of five children growing up in Greek culture, Zenos admired, respected, and was drawn to Greek sculpture. Greek art influenced his aesthetic vision; additional inspiration came from sculptors [[Michelangelo]], [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]], [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux|Carpeaux]] and [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]]. The poetry of [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[Robert Frost|Frost]], [[Theodore Roethke|Roethke]] and [[Robert Graves|Graves]], is important to Zenos, as is philosophy.\n\n\nBorn in 1951 in [[San Francisco]], Frudakis was raised in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], and [[Gary, Indiana]], where he worked in the steel mills. He began drawing at a very young age, and in 1972 came to Philadelphia to study at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]]. He studied sculpture with two [[Prix de Rome]] winners: his elder brother, sculptor Evangelos Frudakis, and painter James Hanes. At the [[University of Pennsylvania]], he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in Fine Art.<ref>Sarah Blackman, \"Sculpting a Life\" (feature article on Frudakis), ''The Pennsylvania Gazette'', Class of '82, November/December 2002, p. 3.</ref>\n\n\n==International Sculptures==\n* ''[[Reaching (sculpture)|Reaching]]''.

The oldest of five children growing up in Greek culture, Zenos admired, respected, and was drawn to Greek sculpture. Greek art influenced his aesthetic vision; additional inspiration came from sculptors [[Michelangelo]], [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]], [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux|Carpeaux]] and [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]]. The poetry of [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[Robert Frost|Frost]], [[Theodore Roethke|Roethke]] and [[Robert Graves|Graves]], is important to Zenos, as is philosophy.\n\n\nBorn in 1951 in [[San Francisco]], Frudakis was raised in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], and [[Gary, Indiana]], where he worked in the steel mills. He began drawing at a very young age, and in 1972 came to Philadelphia to study at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]]. He studied sculpture with two [[Prix de Rome]] winners: his elder brother, sculptor Evangelos Frudakis, and painter James Hanes. At the [[University of Pennsylvania]], he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in Fine Art.<ref>Sarah Blackman, \"Sculpting a Life\" (feature article on Frudakis), ''The Pennsylvania Gazette'', Class of '82, November/December 2002, p. 3.</ref>\n\n\n==International Sculptures==\n* ''[[Reaching (sculpture)|Reaching]]''.

A white woman who openly embraced controversial positions on matters of race and gender equality, she was a [[Southern United States|southern]] [[American liberalism|liberal]] unafraid to criticize [[Racial segregation|segregation]] and work toward the dismantling of [[Jim Crow laws]], at a time when such actions virtually guaranteed social ostracism.\n\n==Early life==\nSmith was born on December 12, 1897, to a prominent family in [[Jasper, Florida]], the seventh of nine children. Her life as the daughter of a middle-class civic and business leader took an abrupt turn in 1915 when her father lost his [[turpentine]] mills. The family was not without resources, however, and decided to relocate to their summer residence in the mountains of [[Clayton, Georgia|Clayton]], [[Georgia (US state)|Georgia]], where her father had previously purchased property and operated the Laurel Falls Camp for Girls.\n\nNow a young adult financially on her own, she was free to pursue her love of music and teaching for the next five years. She spent a year studying at [[Piedmont College]] in [[Demorest, Georgia|Demorest]], Georgia, (1915\u201316). She also had two stints at the [[Peabody Conservatory]] in [[Baltimore]] in 1917 and 1919. She returned home and helped her parents manage a hotel and taught in two mountain schools before accepting a position to be director of music at a [[Methodist]] school for girls in [[Huzhou]] (now Wuxing, [[Zhejiang]]), China. She was not a churchgoer and did not consider herself religious, however this time abroad gave way for a pivotal moment in Smith's awareness of the Southern [[double standard]]. She studied Chinese philosophy during her time overseas and by living in China was exposed to the similarities between the suppression of the Chinese and African Americans in the States.<ref name=Hobson>{{cite web|last1=Hobson|first1=Fred|title=The sins of the fathers: Lillian Smith and Katharine Du Pre Lumpkin|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/literary-criticism/1316731/sins-fathers-lillian-smith-katharine-du-pre-lumpkin|publisher=EBSCO|work=The Southern Review|accessdate=May 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nHer time in China was limited, however, by her father's declining health, so she was forced to return home to the States in 1925. Back in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], she assumed the role of heading the Laurel Falls Camp, a position she would hold for the next 23 years (1925\u201348). Laurel Falls Camp soon became very popular under her direction as an innovative educational institution known for its instruction in the arts, music, drama, and modern psychology. Her father died in 1930, and she was left with responsibility for the family business and the care of her ill mother.\n\n==Relationship and career==\nDuring her time at the family camp, Lillian Smith soon formed a lifelong relationship with one of the camp's school counselors, Paula Snelling, of [[Pinehurst, Georgia]]. The two remained closeted as a same-sex couple for the rest of their lives, as their correspondence has shown.<ref>Gladney, Margaret Rose, \"Personalizing the Political, Politicizing the Personal: Reflections on Editing the Letters of Lillian Smith\", in ''Carryin' On in the Lesbian and Gay South'', John Howard (ed.), New York and London: New York University Press, 1997, p. 102.</ref> In the South, gender roles were binarily distinct and Smith never addressed her sexuality openly. However, some of her literature's characters were lesbian. At that time, homosexuality was more of a taboo in Southern Society than desegregation.<ref name=Hobson /> Lillian and Paula began publishing a small, quarterly literary magazine, ''Pseudopodia'', in 1936. The magazine encouraged writers, black or white, to offer honest assessments of modern southern life, to challenge for social and economic reform, and it criticized those who ignored the Old South's poverty and injustices. It quickly gained regional fame as a forum for liberal thought, undergoing two name changes to reflect its expanding scope. In 1937 it became the ''North Georgia Review'', and in 1942, the title was changed to its final form, ''South Today''. ''South Today'' ceased publication in 1945.\n\nIn 1944, she published the bestselling novel ''[[Strange Fruit (novel)|Strange Fruit]]'', which dealt with the then-forbidden and controversial theme of interracial romance. The title was originally ''Jordan is so Chilly'', with Smith later changing the title to ''Strange Fruit''. In her autobiography, singer [[Billie Holiday]] wrote that Smith chose to name the book after her song \"[[Strange Fruit]]\", which was about the lynching and racism against [[African-Americans]], although Smith maintained that the book's title referred to the \"damaged, twisted people (both black and white) who are the products or results of our racist culture.\"<ref name=SFP>{{cite book|editor1=Perkins, Kathy|editor2=Judith Stephens|title=Strange Fruit: Plays on Lynching by American Women|year=1998|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=0253211638|pages=222\u2013225|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G1il9uQG3A8C&q=strange+fruit#v=snippet&q=%22strange%20fruit%22&f=false}}</ref><ref name=\"stover1944\">{{Cite news |last=Stover |first=Frances|title=Lillian Smith's 'Strange Fruit' stirs a storm |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AvAZAAAAIBAJ&sjid=BCMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3016,4001421&dq=lillian-smith+strange-fruit&hl=en\n|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal |date=March 26, 1944 |page=3\n|accessdate=December 24, 2009}}</ref><ref name=CJohnson>{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Cheryl L.|title=The Language of Sexuality and Silence in Lillian Smith's ''Strange Fruit''|journal=Signs|date=Autumn 2001|volume= 27|issue= 1|pages=1\u201322|jstor=3175864|doi=10.1086/495668}}</ref> After the book's release, the book was [[banned in Boston]] and Detroit for \"lewdness\" and crude language.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hub Head Cop Blackens City In Book Ban|work=Billboard|date=April 1, 1944|pages=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TAwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT2&lpg=PT2&dq=%22Strange+Fruit%22+Lillian+Smith+banned&source=bl&ots=xRjAFG_ct5&sig=vdNiNdF9xJLX996Gr0kUiKr2Q1E&hl=en&sa=X&ei=e6N9UPyhMOTl0QGOwoHgAw&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw}}</ref> ''Strange Fruit'' was also banned from being mailed through the U.S. Postal Service, with the ban against the book being lifted by [[President Franklin D.

She also emphasized the negative implications on the minds of women and children. Written in a confessional and autobiographical style that was highly critical of southern moderates, it met with something of a cruel silence from book critics and the literary community.\n\n==Civil Rights activism==\n\nOne of the ways Smith started openly discussing the problems of segregation was during her counseling of campers at Laurel Falls. It was this period of creative control over the camp that allowed her to use it as a place to discuss modern social issues, like the dangers of inequality and how to improve their society as women.<ref name=Heroines>{{cite web|last1=Michels|first1=Kat|title=Heroines of History: Lillian Smith - A Civil Rights Leader Ahead of her Time|url=http://businessheroinemagazine.com/lilliansmith/|website=Business Heroine Magazine|accessdate= May 7, 2017}}</ref> In 1955, the [[civil rights movement]] grabbed the entire nation's attention with the [[Montgomery bus boycott]]. By this time she had been meeting or corresponding with many southern blacks and liberal whites for years and was well aware of blacks' concerns. In response to [[Brown v. Board of Education]], the ruling that outlawed segregation in schools, she wrote ''Now Is the Time'' (1955), calling for compliance with the new court decision. She called the new ruling \"every child's [[Magna Carta]]\".\n\n==Death==\n\nSmith battled [[breast cancer]] from the early 1950s on and died on September 28, 1966, at the age of 68. Her book ''The Journey'' (1954) details some of this battle. She is buried near the old theater chimney, Laurel Falls camp atop Screamer Mountain, Clayton, Georgia.<ref>Wilson, Scott. ''Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons'', 3d edn: 2 (Kindle Locations 43992-43993). McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nToday, ''[[Strange Fruit (novel)|Strange Fruit]]'' remains her most famous work, translated into 15 languages, but many of her works, like ''Killers of the Dream'', are being rediscovered and given their due as groundbreaking in both style and substance. She no doubt deserves recognition as one of the first prominent Southern whites to write about and speak out openly against racism and segregation. Her lifelong convictions are summed up in her acceptance speech for the [[Charles S. Johnson]] Award at [[Fisk University]] in 1966: \"Segregation is evil; there is no pattern of life which can dehumanize men as can the way of segregation.\"\n\nIn 1999, Lillian Smith received the Georgia Women of Achievement Award.<ref>[https://www.georgiawomen.org/copy-of-sibley-celestine \"Lillian Eugenia Smith\"], Georgia Women of Achievement.</ref>\n\nSince 1968, the [[Lillian Smith Book Award]]s have been presented annually, except for 2003 when the Southern Regional Council experienced funding shortfalls.<ref>AP, [https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2004-02-12-lillian-book-awards_x.htm \"Lillian Smith Book Awards for works on social justice to be revived\"], ''USAToday'', February 12, 2004.<!-- Bot generated title --></ref> It is the South's oldest and best-known book award, and is presented in fiction and non-fiction categories.<ref name=Heroines /> It is meant to honor those authors who, through their outstanding writing about the American South, carry on Smith's legacy of elucidating the condition of racial and social inequity and proposing a vision of justice and human understanding. According to \"The Language of Sexuality and Silence in Lillian Smith's ''Strange Fruit''\", her work examines many different perspectives of American consciousness and is a great source to better understand Southern history post-Civil War through the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. She could also be used as a reliable patron for gay and lesbian research based on her relationship with Snelling.<ref name=CJohnson />\n\n==Selected works==\n*''[[Strange Fruit (novel)|Strange Fruit]]'' (1944) {{ISBN|9781568494203}}, {{OCLC|184751847}}\n*''Killers of the Dream'', (1949) {{ISBN|9780393311600}}, {{OCLC|951462511}}\n*''The Journey'', New York: Norton,(1954) {{OCLC|745967889}}\n*''Now Is the Time'', New York: Viking Press (1955) {{ISBN|9781578066315}}. {{OCLC|53091211}}\n*''One Hour'', Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press (1959), {{OCLC|962028726}} \u2013 an attack on [[McCarthyism]] in the form of a novel\n*''Memory of a Large Christmas'', New York: Norton, (1962) {{ISBN|9780820318424}}. {{OCLC|53263972}}\n*''Our Faces, Our Words'', New York: W.W.

The family was not without resources, however, and decided to relocate to their summer residence in the mountains of [[Clayton, Georgia|Clayton]], [[Georgia (US state)|Georgia]], where her father had previously purchased property and operated the Laurel Falls Camp for Girls.\n\nNow a young adult financially on her own, she was free to pursue her love of music and teaching for the next five years. She spent a year studying at [[Piedmont College]] in [[Demorest, Georgia|Demorest]], Georgia, (1915\u201316). She also had two stints at the [[Peabody Conservatory]] in [[Baltimore]] in 1917 and 1919. She returned home and helped her parents manage a hotel and taught in two mountain schools before accepting a position to be director of music at a [[Methodist]] school for girls in [[Huzhou]] (now Wuxing, [[Zhejiang]]), China. She was not a churchgoer and did not consider herself religious, however this time abroad gave way for a pivotal moment in Smith's awareness of the Southern [[double standard]]. She studied Chinese philosophy during her time overseas and by living in China was exposed to the similarities between the suppression of the Chinese and African Americans in the States.<ref name=Hobson>{{cite web|last1=Hobson|first1=Fred|title=The sins of the fathers: Lillian Smith and Katharine Du Pre Lumpkin|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/literary-criticism/1316731/sins-fathers-lillian-smith-katharine-du-pre-lumpkin|publisher=EBSCO|work=The Southern Review|accessdate=May 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nHer time in China was limited, however, by her father's declining health, so she was forced to return home to the States in 1925. Back in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], she assumed the role of heading the Laurel Falls Camp, a position she would hold for the next 23 years (1925\u201348). Laurel Falls Camp soon became very popular under her direction as an innovative educational institution known for its instruction in the arts, music, drama, and modern psychology. Her father died in 1930, and she was left with responsibility for the family business and the care of her ill mother.\n\n==Relationship and career==\nDuring her time at the family camp, Lillian Smith soon formed a lifelong relationship with one of the camp's school counselors, Paula Snelling, of [[Pinehurst, Georgia]]. The two remained closeted as a same-sex couple for the rest of their lives, as their correspondence has shown.<ref>Gladney, Margaret Rose, \"Personalizing the Political, Politicizing the Personal: Reflections on Editing the Letters of Lillian Smith\", in ''Carryin' On in the Lesbian and Gay South'', John Howard (ed.), New York and London: New York University Press, 1997, p. 102.</ref> In the South, gender roles were binarily distinct and Smith never addressed her sexuality openly. However, some of her literature's characters were lesbian. At that time, homosexuality was more of a taboo in Southern Society than desegregation.<ref name=Hobson /> Lillian and Paula began publishing a small, quarterly literary magazine, ''Pseudopodia'', in 1936. The magazine encouraged writers, black or white, to offer honest assessments of modern southern life, to challenge for social and economic reform, and it criticized those who ignored the Old South's poverty and injustices. It quickly gained regional fame as a forum for liberal thought, undergoing two name changes to reflect its expanding scope. In 1937 it became the ''North Georgia Review'', and in 1942, the title was changed to its final form, ''South Today''. ''South Today'' ceased publication in 1945.\n\nIn 1944, she published the bestselling novel ''[[Strange Fruit (novel)|Strange Fruit]]'', which dealt with the then-forbidden and controversial theme of interracial romance. The title was originally ''Jordan is so Chilly'', with Smith later changing the title to ''Strange Fruit''. In her autobiography, singer [[Billie Holiday]] wrote that Smith chose to name the book after her song \"[[Strange Fruit]]\", which was about the lynching and racism against [[African-Americans]], although Smith maintained that the book's title referred to the \"damaged, twisted people (both black and white) who are the products or results of our racist culture.\"<ref name=SFP>{{cite book|editor1=Perkins, Kathy|editor2=Judith Stephens|title=Strange Fruit: Plays on Lynching by American Women|year=1998|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=0253211638|pages=222\u2013225|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G1il9uQG3A8C&q=strange+fruit#v=snippet&q=%22strange%20fruit%22&f=false}}</ref><ref name=\"stover1944\">{{Cite news |last=Stover |first=Frances|title=Lillian Smith's 'Strange Fruit' stirs a storm |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=AvAZAAAAIBAJ&sjid=BCMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3016,4001421&dq=lillian-smith+strange-fruit&hl=en\n|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal |date=March 26, 1944 |page=3\n|accessdate=December 24, 2009}}</ref><ref name=CJohnson>{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Cheryl L.|title=The Language of Sexuality and Silence in Lillian Smith's ''Strange Fruit''|journal=Signs|date=Autumn 2001|volume= 27|issue= 1|pages=1\u201322|jstor=3175864|doi=10.1086/495668}}</ref> After the book's release, the book was [[banned in Boston]] and Detroit for \"lewdness\" and crude language.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hub Head Cop Blackens City In Book Ban|work=Billboard|date=April 1, 1944|pages=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TAwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT2&lpg=PT2&dq=%22Strange+Fruit%22+Lillian+Smith+banned&source=bl&ots=xRjAFG_ct5&sig=vdNiNdF9xJLX996Gr0kUiKr2Q1E&hl=en&sa=X&ei=e6N9UPyhMOTl0QGOwoHgAw&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw}}</ref> ''Strange Fruit'' was also banned from being mailed through the U.S. Postal Service, with the ban against the book being lifted by [[President Franklin D.

She also emphasized the negative implications on the minds of women and children. Written in a confessional and autobiographical style that was highly critical of southern moderates, it met with something of a cruel silence from book critics and the literary community.\n\n==Civil Rights activism==\n\nOne of the ways Smith started openly discussing the problems of segregation was during her counseling of campers at Laurel Falls. It was this period of creative control over the camp that allowed her to use it as a place to discuss modern social issues, like the dangers of inequality and how to improve their society as women.<ref name=Heroines>{{cite web|last1=Michels|first1=Kat|title=Heroines of History: Lillian Smith - A Civil Rights Leader Ahead of her Time|url=http://businessheroinemagazine.com/lilliansmith/|website=Business Heroine Magazine|accessdate= May 7, 2017}}</ref> In 1955, the [[civil rights movement]] grabbed the entire nation's attention with the [[Montgomery bus boycott]]. By this time she had been meeting or corresponding with many southern blacks and liberal whites for years and was well aware of blacks' concerns. In response to [[Brown v. Board of Education]], the ruling that outlawed segregation in schools, she wrote ''Now Is the Time'' (1955), calling for compliance with the new court decision. She called the new ruling \"every child's [[Magna Carta]]\".\n\n==Death==\n\nSmith battled [[breast cancer]] from the early 1950s on and died on September 28, 1966, at the age of 68. Her book ''The Journey'' (1954) details some of this battle. She is buried near the old theater chimney, Laurel Falls camp atop Screamer Mountain, Clayton, Georgia.<ref>Wilson, Scott. ''Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons'', 3d edn: 2 (Kindle Locations 43992-43993). McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nToday, ''[[Strange Fruit (novel)|Strange Fruit]]'' remains her most famous work, translated into 15 languages, but many of her works, like ''Killers of the Dream'', are being rediscovered and given their due as groundbreaking in both style and substance. She no doubt deserves recognition as one of the first prominent Southern whites to write about and speak out openly against racism and segregation. Her lifelong convictions are summed up in her acceptance speech for the [[Charles S. Johnson]] Award at [[Fisk University]] in 1966: \"Segregation is evil; there is no pattern of life which can dehumanize men as can the way of segregation.\"\n\nIn 1999, Lillian Smith received the Georgia Women of Achievement Award.<ref>[https://www.georgiawomen.org/copy-of-sibley-celestine \"Lillian Eugenia Smith\"], Georgia Women of Achievement.</ref>\n\nSince 1968, the [[Lillian Smith Book Award]]s have been presented annually, except for 2003 when the Southern Regional Council experienced funding shortfalls.<ref>AP, [https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2004-02-12-lillian-book-awards_x.htm \"Lillian Smith Book Awards for works on social justice to be revived\"], ''USAToday'', February 12, 2004.<!-- Bot generated title --></ref> It is the South's oldest and best-known book award, and is presented in fiction and non-fiction categories.<ref name=Heroines /> It is meant to honor those authors who, through their outstanding writing about the American South, carry on Smith's legacy of elucidating the condition of racial and social inequity and proposing a vision of justice and human understanding. According to \"The Language of Sexuality and Silence in Lillian Smith's ''Strange Fruit''\", her work examines many different perspectives of American consciousness and is a great source to better understand Southern history post-Civil War through the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. She could also be used as a reliable patron for gay and lesbian research based on her relationship with Snelling.<ref name=CJohnson />\n\n==Selected works==\n*''[[Strange Fruit (novel)|Strange Fruit]]'' (1944) {{ISBN|9781568494203}}, {{OCLC|184751847}}\n*''Killers of the Dream'', (1949) {{ISBN|9780393311600}}, {{OCLC|951462511}}\n*''The Journey'', New York: Norton,(1954) {{OCLC|745967889}}\n*''Now Is the Time'', New York: Viking Press (1955) {{ISBN|9781578066315}}. {{OCLC|53091211}}\n*''One Hour'', Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press (1959), {{OCLC|962028726}} \u2013 an attack on [[McCarthyism]] in the form of a novel\n*''Memory of a Large Christmas'', New York: Norton, (1962) {{ISBN|9780820318424}}. {{OCLC|53263972}}\n*''Our Faces, Our Words'', New York: W.W.
