[[Brahma]] created an army of [[vanara]] (intelligent warrior monkeys) to aid Rama. Led by [[Nila (Ramayana)|Nila]] and under the engineering direction of [[Nala (Ramayana)|Nala]], the vanara constructed a bridge to Lanka in five days.\n\nRama crossed the sea on this bridge, and pursued Ravana for many days. He fired hundreds of golden arrows which became serpents that cut off Ravana's heads, but ultimately had to use the divine arrow of Brahma (which had the power of the gods in it and cannot miss its target) to slay Ravana.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/cult/inside/gallery/ravanadeath/ravanaheads.html |title=Ravana loses his heads |publisher=British Library |accessdate=15 April 2019}}</ref><ref name=Hakai>{{cite web |url=https://www.hakaimagazine.com/news/god-or-geology-genesis-rams-bridge/ |title=God or Geology?

These Indians were forcibly removed to Kansas by the United States government in 1838, and many died on what survivors called the [[Potawatomi Trail of Death|Trail of Death]].<ref name=\"La Porte County Historical Society\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.laportecountyhistory.org/history.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517164346/http://laportecountyhistory.org/history.htm|url-status=dead|title=La Porte County Historical Society|archivedate=May 17, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.potawatomi-tda.org/ptodhist.htm|title=History of 1838 Trail of Death|work=potawatomi-tda.org}}</ref>\n\nLaPorte County's initial [[European-American]] settlers were [[Yankee]] migrants, that is to say they were from [[New England]] or were from [[upstate New York]] and had parents who were from [[New England]], and were descended from the [[English American|English]] [[Puritans]] who settled [[New England]] in the colonial era.  They were part of a wave of [[New England]] settlers moving west into what was then the [[Northwest Territory]] after the completion of the [[Erie Canal]] through the Mohawk Valley of New York State.\n\nThese first settlers in LaPorte County specifically hailed from the [[Massachusetts]] towns of Granville, Boston, Bridgewater, West Bridgewater, Andover, Nantucket Island, and [[Hampshire County, Massachusetts|Hampshire County]]; the [[Connecticut]] towns of Colchester, Wethersfield, Granby, and New Haven; the [[New Hampshire]] towns of [[Bradford, New Hampshire|Bradford]], [[Amherst, New Hampshire|Amherst]] and Goffstown; the Vermont villages of Dorset, Albany and Fairfax; many also came from [[Orange County, Vermont]], [[Caledonia County, Vermont]] and [[Penobscot County, Maine]].  They were mainly members of the [[Congregational church|Congregational Church]]. As result of the [[Second Great Awakening]], many became [[Baptists]] and many also converted to [[Pentecostalism]] and [[Methodism]].  When they arrived in what is now LaPorte County, there was nothing but virgin forest and prairie. The [[New England]] settlers cleared roads and brush, developed farms, constructed churches, erected government buildings, and established post routes.  As a result of this migration, La Porte County was partially culturally continuous with early [[New England]] culture for many years.<ref>''The Expansion of New England: The Spread of New England Settlement and Institutions to the Mississippi River, 1620-1865'', by Lois Kimball Matthews, pp. 201-202</ref>\n\nBut by 1850, the three Eastern states that had contributed the most residents to LaPorte County were New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia, surpassing those migrants from New England. LaPorte County had the largest number of Southerners north of the Wabash Valley.<ref>Lang, Elfrieda. \u201cSouthern Migration to Northern Indiana Before 1850.\u201d ''Indiana Magazine of History,'' Volume 50, Issue 4, pp 349-356. 1954.\nLang, Elfrieda. \u201cAn Analysis of Northern Indiana\u2019s Population in 1850.\u201d ''Indiana Magazine of History,'' Volume 49, Issue 1, March 1953.\nRose, Gregory C.\u201d Upland Southerners: The County Origins of Southern Migrants.\u201d ''Indiana Magazine of History,'' Volume 82, Issue 3, September 1991.</ref>\n\nDuring the Civil War, the ''Louisville Journal'' noted that the 29th Indiana Regiment (mustered out of LaPorte) \"may almost be regarded as a Kentucky regiment for a large majority of its members are either natives or descendants of native Kentuckians\".<ref>''La Porte Herald,'' 19 October 1861, p. 2</ref>\n\nWhen the county was initially proposed and organized, its boundaries did not extend as far south or east as they do today.  A section of land north of the [[Kankakee River]] originally belonged to Starke County.  However, residents living in that area had difficulty crossing the river in order to reach the rest of the county.  It was necessary to travel some distance east to Lemon's bridge, before making the journey south.  Effectively isolated from the rest of Starke County, these residents asked that their land be annexed to LaPorte County, which was completed on January 28, 1842.  Thereafter, the Kankakee River formed the southern boundary of the county.

These Indians were forcibly removed to Kansas by the United States government in 1838, and many died on what survivors called the [[Potawatomi Trail of Death|Trail of Death]].<ref name=\"La Porte County Historical Society\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.laportecountyhistory.org/history.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517164346/http://laportecountyhistory.org/history.htm|url-status=dead|title=La Porte County Historical Society|archivedate=May 17, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.potawatomi-tda.org/ptodhist.htm|title=History of 1838 Trail of Death|work=potawatomi-tda.org}}</ref>\n\nLaPorte County's initial [[European-American]] settlers were [[Yankee]] migrants, that is to say they were from [[New England]] or were from [[upstate New York]] and had parents who were from [[New England]], and were descended from the [[English American|English]] [[Puritans]] who settled [[New England]] in the colonial era.  They were part of a wave of [[New England]] settlers moving west into what was then the [[Northwest Territory]] after the completion of the [[Erie Canal]] through the Mohawk Valley of New York State.\n\nThese first settlers in LaPorte County specifically hailed from the [[Massachusetts]] towns of Granville, Boston, Bridgewater, West Bridgewater, Andover, Nantucket Island, and [[Hampshire County, Massachusetts|Hampshire County]]; the [[Connecticut]] towns of Colchester, Wethersfield, Granby, and New Haven; the [[New Hampshire]] towns of [[Bradford, New Hampshire|Bradford]], [[Amherst, New Hampshire|Amherst]] and Goffstown; the Vermont villages of Dorset, Albany and Fairfax; many also came from [[Orange County, Vermont]], [[Caledonia County, Vermont]] and [[Penobscot County, Maine]].  They were mainly members of the [[Congregational church|Congregational Church]]. As result of the [[Second Great Awakening]], many became [[Baptists]] and many also converted to [[Pentecostalism]] and [[Methodism]].  When they arrived in what is now LaPorte County, there was nothing but virgin forest and prairie. The [[New England]] settlers cleared roads and brush, developed farms, constructed churches, erected government buildings, and established post routes.  As a result of this migration, La Porte County was partially culturally continuous with early [[New England]] culture for many years.<ref>''The Expansion of New England: The Spread of New England Settlement and Institutions to the Mississippi River, 1620-1865'', by Lois Kimball Matthews, pp. 201-202</ref>\n\nBut by 1850, the three Eastern states that had contributed the most residents to LaPorte County were New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia, surpassing those migrants from New England. LaPorte County had the largest number of Southerners north of the Wabash Valley.<ref>Lang, Elfrieda. \u201cSouthern Migration to Northern Indiana Before 1850.\u201d ''Indiana Magazine of History,'' Volume 50, Issue 4, pp 349-356. 1954.\nLang, Elfrieda. \u201cAn Analysis of Northern Indiana\u2019s Population in 1850.\u201d ''Indiana Magazine of History,'' Volume 49, Issue 1, March 1953.\nRose, Gregory C.\u201d Upland Southerners: The County Origins of Southern Migrants.\u201d ''Indiana Magazine of History,'' Volume 82, Issue 3, September 1991.</ref>\n\nDuring the Civil War, the ''Louisville Journal'' noted that the 29th Indiana Regiment (mustered out of LaPorte) \"may almost be regarded as a Kentucky regiment for a large majority of its members are either natives or descendants of native Kentuckians\".<ref>''La Porte Herald,'' 19 October 1861, p. 2</ref>\n\nWhen the county was initially proposed and organized, its boundaries did not extend as far south or east as they do today.  A section of land north of the [[Kankakee River]] originally belonged to Starke County.  However, residents living in that area had difficulty crossing the river in order to reach the rest of the county.  It was necessary to travel some distance east to Lemon's bridge, before making the journey south.  Effectively isolated from the rest of Starke County, these residents asked that their land be annexed to LaPorte County, which was completed on January 28, 1842.  Thereafter, the Kankakee River formed the southern boundary of the county.

It assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be described using a [[monotonic]] function.\n\nThe Spearman correlation between two variables is equal to the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|Pearson correlation]] between the rank values of those two variables; while Pearson's correlation assesses linear relationships, Spearman's correlation assesses monotonic relationships (whether linear or not). If there are no repeated data values, a perfect Spearman correlation of +1 or \u22121 occurs when each of the variables is a perfect monotone function of the other.\n\nIntuitively, the Spearman correlation between two variables will be high when observations have a similar (or identical for a correlation of 1) [[Ranking (statistics)|rank]] (i.e. relative position label of the observations within the variable: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) between the two variables, and low when observations have a dissimilar (or fully opposed for a correlation of \u22121) rank between the two variables.\n\nSpearman's coefficient is appropriate for both [[continuous variable|continuous]] and discrete [[ordinal variable]]s.<ref>[[Level of measurement#Typology|Scale types]].</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Jmp For Basic Univariate And Multivariate Statistics: A Step-by-step Guide |last=Lehman |first=Ann |publisher=SAS Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-59047-576-8 |location=Cary, NC |page=123}}</ref> Both Spearman's <math>\\rho</math> and [[Kendall tau rank correlation coefficient|Kendall's <math>\\tau</math>]] can be formulated as special cases of a more [[general correlation coefficient]].\n\n==Definition and calculation==\nThe Spearman correlation coefficient is defined as the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|Pearson correlation coefficient]] between the [[Ranking|rank variables]].<ref name=\"myers2003\">{{Cite book | last1=Myers | first1=Jerome L. | first2=Arnold D. |last2= Well | title=Research Design and Statistical Analysis | publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum | year=2003 | edition=2nd | isbn=978-0-8058-4037-7 | pages=508}}</ref>\n\nFor a sample of size ''n'', the ''n'' [[raw score]]s <math>X_i, Y_i</math> are converted to ranks <math>\\operatorname{rg} X_i, \\operatorname{rg} Y_i</math>, and <math>r_s</math> is computed as\n\n: <math>\n r_s =\n \\rho_{\\operatorname{rg}_X,\\operatorname{rg}_Y} =\n \\frac{\\operatorname{cov}(\\operatorname{rg}_X, \\operatorname{rg}_Y)}\n      {\\sigma_{\\operatorname{rg}_X} \\sigma_{\\operatorname{rg}_Y}},\n</math>\n\nwhere\n: <math>\\rho</math> denotes the usual [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|Pearson correlation coefficient]], but applied to the rank variables,\n: <math>\\operatorname{cov}(\\operatorname{rg}_X, \\operatorname{rg}_Y)</math> is the [[covariance]] of the rank variables,\n: <math>\\sigma_{\\operatorname{rg}_X}</math> and <math>\\sigma_{\\operatorname{rg}_Y}</math> are the [[standard deviation]]s of the rank variables.\n\nOnly if all ''n'' ranks are ''distinct integers'', it can be computed using the popular formula\n\n: <math>r_s = 1 - \\frac{6 \\sum d_i^2}{n(n^2 - 1)},</math>\n\nwhere\n: <math>d_i = \\operatorname{rg}(X_i) - \\operatorname{rg}(Y_i)</math> is the difference between the two ranks of each observation,\n: ''n'' is the number of observations.\n\nIdentical values are usually<ref>{{cite book | last=Dodge | first=Yadolah | date=2010 | title=The Concise Encyclopedia of Statistics | publisher=Springer-Verlag New York  | page=502 | isbn=978-0-387-31742-7 }}</ref> each assigned [[Ranking#Fractional ranking .28.221 2.5 2.5 4.22 ranking.29|fractional ranks]] equal to the average of their positions in the ascending order of the values, which is equivalent to averaging over all possible permutations.\n\nIf ties are present in the data set, the simplified formula above yields incorrect results: Only if in both variables all ranks are distinct, then <math>\\sigma_{\\operatorname{rg}_X} \\sigma_{\\operatorname{rg}_Y} = \\operatorname{Var}{\\operatorname{rg}_X} = \\operatorname{Var}{\\operatorname{rg}_Y} = (n^2 - 1)/12</math> (calculated according to biased variance).\nThe first equation \u2014 normalizing by the standard deviation \u2014 may be used even when ranks are normalized to [0,&nbsp;1] (\"relative ranks\") because it is insensitive both to translation and linear scaling.\n<!-- For example, if [1,2,3,4,5] vs. [1,3,3,3,5] has r_s=0.894, but the simplified formula yields 0.877. -->\n\nThe simplified method should also not be used in cases where the data set is truncated;

In continuous distributions, the grade of an observation is, by convention, always one half less than the rank, and hence the grade and rank correlations are the same in this case. More generally, the \u201cgrade\u201d of an observation is proportional to an estimate of the fraction of a population less than a given value, with the half-observation adjustment at observed values. Thus this corresponds to one possible treatment of tied ranks.

If  ''Y'' tends to increase when ''X'' increases, the Spearman correlation coefficient is positive.  If ''Y'' tends to decrease when ''X'' increases, the Spearman correlation coefficient is negative.  A Spearman correlation of zero indicates that there is no tendency for ''Y'' to either increase or decrease when ''X'' increases.  The Spearman correlation increases in magnitude as ''X'' and ''Y'' become closer to being perfectly monotone functions of each other.  When ''X'' and ''Y'' are perfectly monotonically related, the Spearman correlation coefficient becomes 1.  A perfectly monotone increasing relationship implies that for any two pairs of data values {{math|''X''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''Y''<sub>''i''</sub>}} and {{math|''X''<sub>''j''</sub>, ''Y''<sub>''j''</sub>}}, that {{math|''X''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2212 ''X''<sub>''j''</sub>}} and {{math|''Y''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2212 ''Y''<sub>''j''</sub>}} always have the same sign.  A perfectly monotone decreasing relationship implies that these differences always have opposite signs.\n\nThe Spearman correlation coefficient is often described as being \"nonparametric\".  This can have two meanings.  First, a perfect Spearman correlation results when ''X'' and ''Y'' are related by any [[monotonic function]]. Contrast this with the Pearson correlation, which only gives a perfect value when ''X'' and ''Y'' are related by a ''linear'' function. The other sense in which the Spearman correlation is nonparametric in that its exact sampling distribution can be obtained without requiring knowledge (i.e., knowing the parameters) of the [[joint probability distribution]] of ''X'' and ''Y''.\n\n==Example==\nIn this example, the raw data in the table below is used to calculate the correlation between the [[IQ]] of a person with the number of hours spent in front of [[TV]] per week. {{Citation needed|reason=Is it actual data?|date=February 2018}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n![[IQ]], <math>X_i</math>\n!Hours of [[TV]] per week, <math>Y_i</math>\n|-\n|106\n|7\n|-\n|100\n|27\n|-\n|86\n|2\n|-\n|101\n|50\n|-\n|99\n|28\n|-\n|103\n|29\n|-12\n|97\n|20\n|-\n|113\n|12\n|-\n|112\n|6\n|-\n|110\n|17\n|}\n\nFirstly, evaluate <math>d^2_i</math>.

The value of ''n'' is 10. These values can now be substituted back into the equation\n\n: <math>\\rho = 1 - \\frac{6 \\sum d_i^2}{n(n^2 - 1)}</math>\n\nto give\n\n: <math>\\rho = 1 - \\frac{6 \\times 194}{10(10^2 - 1)},</math>\n\nwhich evaluates to {{math|1=''\u03c1'' = \u221229/165 = \u22120.175757575...}} with a [[p-value|''p''-value]] = 0.627188 (using the [[Student's t-distribution|''t''-distribution]]).\n\n[[File:Spearman's Rank chart.png|thumb|Chart of the data presented. It can be seen that there might be a negative correlation, but that the relationship does not appear definitive.]]\nThat the value is close to zero shows that the correlation between IQ and hours spent watching TV is very low, although the negative value suggests that the longer the time spent watching television the lower the IQ. In the case of ties in the original values, this formula should not be used; instead, the Pearson correlation coefficient should be calculated on the ranks (where ties are given ranks, as described above {{Where|date=February 2018}}).\n\n==Determining significance==\nOne approach to test whether an observed value of ''\u03c1'' is significantly different from zero (''r'' will always maintain {{nowrap|\u22121 \u2264 ''r'' \u2264 1}}) is to calculate the probability that it would be greater than or equal to the observed ''r'', given the [[null hypothesis]], by using a [[Resampling (statistics)#Permutation tests|permutation test]]. An advantage of this approach is that it automatically takes into account the number of tied data values in the sample and the way they are treated in computing the rank correlation.\n\nAnother approach parallels the use of the [[Fisher transformation]] in the case of the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. That is, [[confidence intervals]] and [[hypothesis test]]s relating to the population value ''\u03c1'' can be carried out using the Fisher transformation:\n\n: <math>F(r) = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln\\frac{1 + r}{1 - r} = \\operatorname{arctanh} r.</math>\n\nIf ''F''(''r'') is the Fisher transformation of ''r'', the sample Spearman rank correlation coefficient, and ''n'' is the sample size, then\n\n: <math>z = \\sqrt{\\frac{n - 3}{1.06}} F(r)</math>\n\nis a [[standard score|''z''-score]] for ''r'', which approximately follows a standard [[normal distribution]] under the [[null hypothesis]] of [[statistical independence]] ({{math|1=''\u03c1'' = 0}}).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Choi |first=S.

If  ''Y'' tends to increase when ''X'' increases, the Spearman correlation coefficient is positive.  If ''Y'' tends to decrease when ''X'' increases, the Spearman correlation coefficient is negative.  A Spearman correlation of zero indicates that there is no tendency for ''Y'' to either increase or decrease when ''X'' increases.  The Spearman correlation increases in magnitude as ''X'' and ''Y'' become closer to being perfectly monotone functions of each other.  When ''X'' and ''Y'' are perfectly monotonically related, the Spearman correlation coefficient becomes 1.  A perfectly monotone increasing relationship implies that for any two pairs of data values {{math|''X''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''Y''<sub>''i''</sub>}} and {{math|''X''<sub>''j''</sub>, ''Y''<sub>''j''</sub>}}, that {{math|''X''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2212 ''X''<sub>''j''</sub>}} and {{math|''Y''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2212 ''Y''<sub>''j''</sub>}} always have the same sign.  A perfectly monotone decreasing relationship implies that these differences always have opposite signs.\n\nThe Spearman correlation coefficient is often described as being \"nonparametric\".  This can have two meanings.  First, a perfect Spearman correlation results when ''X'' and ''Y'' are related by any [[monotonic function]]. Contrast this with the Pearson correlation, which only gives a perfect value when ''X'' and ''Y'' are related by a ''linear'' function. The other sense in which the Spearman correlation is nonparametric in that its exact sampling distribution can be obtained without requiring knowledge (i.e., knowing the parameters) of the [[joint probability distribution]] of ''X'' and ''Y''.\n\n==Example==\nIn this example, the raw data in the table below is used to calculate the correlation between the [[IQ]] of a person with the number of hours spent in front of [[TV]] per week. {{Citation needed|reason=Is it actual data?|date=February 2018}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n![[IQ]], <math>X_i</math>\n!Hours of [[TV]] per week, <math>Y_i</math>\n|-\n|106\n|7\n|-\n|100\n|27\n|-\n|86\n|2\n|-\n|101\n|50\n|-\n|99\n|28\n|-\n|103\n|29\n|-12\n|97\n|20\n|-\n|113\n|12\n|-\n|112\n|6\n|-\n|110\n|17\n|}\n\nFirstly, evaluate <math>d^2_i</math>.

It can be seen that there might be a negative correlation, but that the relationship does not appear definitive.]]\nThat the value is close to zero shows that the correlation between IQ and hours spent watching TV is very low, although the negative value suggests that the longer the time spent watching television the lower the IQ. In the case of ties in the original values, this formula should not be used; instead, the Pearson correlation coefficient should be calculated on the ranks (where ties are given ranks, as described above {{Where|date=February 2018}}).\n\n==Determining significance==\nOne approach to test whether an observed value of ''\u03c1'' is significantly different from zero (''r'' will always maintain {{nowrap|\u22121 \u2264 ''r'' \u2264 1}}) is to calculate the probability that it would be greater than or equal to the observed ''r'', given the [[null hypothesis]], by using a [[Resampling (statistics)#Permutation tests|permutation test]]. An advantage of this approach is that it automatically takes into account the number of tied data values in the sample and the way they are treated in computing the rank correlation.\n\nAnother approach parallels the use of the [[Fisher transformation]] in the case of the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. That is, [[confidence intervals]] and [[hypothesis test]]s relating to the population value ''\u03c1'' can be carried out using the Fisher transformation:\n\n: <math>F(r) = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln\\frac{1 + r}{1 - r} = \\operatorname{arctanh} r.</math>\n\nIf ''F''(''r'') is the Fisher transformation of ''r'', the sample Spearman rank correlation coefficient, and ''n'' is the sample size, then\n\n: <math>z = \\sqrt{\\frac{n - 3}{1.06}} F(r)</math>\n\nis a [[standard score|''z''-score]] for ''r'', which approximately follows a standard [[normal distribution]] under the [[null hypothesis]] of [[statistical independence]] ({{math|1=''\u03c1'' = 0}}).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Choi |first=S.

He later became a pundit and commentator for [[BT Sport]], regularly working on their coverage of Scottish football. He is now also a pundit and occasional match co-commentator on [[BBC Radio 5 Live]].\n\nHe played as a [[forward (association football)|forward]] from 1991 to 2007 for [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Sutton scored over 150 career goals in over 400 league appearances spanning 16 years in the [[Premier League|English]] and [[Scottish Premier League]]s. He was [[cap (football)|capped]] once by [[England national football team|England]].\n\nSutton played principally in midfield or attack, although usually in the latter role as a striker. A very physical player, Sutton was a fairly prolific goalscorer throughout his career and was joint top goalscorer (with [[Dion Dublin]] and [[Michael Owen]]) in the [[FA Premier League 1997\u201398]] season. He was also known as being one of the foremost exponents of the glancing header. He scored many goals with this technique which made him particularly effective from set-pieces.\n\nIn September 2009, Sutton was appointed manager of [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]], but he resigned due to personal reasons twelve months later.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/lincoln_city/9043871.stm |title=Manager Chris Sutton leaves Lincoln City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 September 2010 |accessdate=28 September 2010}}</ref> In 2012, he came out of retirement briefly and featured for non-league [[Wroxham F.C.|Wroxham]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/276490/Former-England-striker-Chris-Sutton-comes-out-of-retirement|title=Former England striker Chris Sutton comes out of retirement|date=11 October 2012|work=Dailystar.co.uk|accessdate=10 March 2017|language=en}}</ref>{{deprecated inline|certain=yes|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Norwich City (1991\u20131994)===\nHe started his career at [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], initially as a centre-half before being converted into a striker by manager [[Dave Stringer]].

Late in the game with the \"Gunners\" leading by a single goal, the ball was kicked out of play by Arsenal to allow an injured teammate to receive treatment. Under the unwritten sportsmanship rule, Arsenal would expect the ball to be returned to them unhindered. However, Sutton chased the ball instead of allowing it to be thrown back to Arsenal and won a corner from his efforts. Blackburn scored from this corner and as a result Arsenal missed out on a lucrative place in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on [[goal difference]].

He later became a pundit and commentator for [[BT Sport]], regularly working on their coverage of Scottish football. He in now also a pundit and occasional match co-commentator on [[BBC Radio 5 Live]].\n\nHe played as a [[forward (association football)|forward]] from 1991 to 2007 for [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Sutton scored over 150 career goals in over 400 league appearances spanning 16 years in the [[Premier League|English]] and [[Scottish Premier League]]s. He was [[cap (football)|capped]] once by [[England national football team|England]].\n\nSutton played principally in midfield or attack, although usually in the latter role as a striker. A very physical player, Sutton was a fairly prolific goalscorer throughout his career and was joint top goalscorer (with [[Dion Dublin]] and [[Michael Owen]]) in the [[FA Premier League 1997\u201398]] season. He was also known as being one of the foremost exponents of the glancing header. He scored many goals with this technique which made him particularly effective from set-pieces.\n\nIn September 2009, Sutton was appointed manager of [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]], but he resigned due to personal reasons twelve months later.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/lincoln_city/9043871.stm |title=Manager Chris Sutton leaves Lincoln City |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 September 2010 |accessdate=28 September 2010}}</ref> In 2012, he came out of retirement briefly and featured for non-league [[Wroxham F.C.|Wroxham]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/276490/Former-England-striker-Chris-Sutton-comes-out-of-retirement|title=Former England striker Chris Sutton comes out of retirement|date=11 October 2012|work=Dailystar.co.uk|accessdate=10 March 2017|language=en}}</ref>{{deprecated inline|certain=yes|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Norwich City (1991\u20131994)===\nHe started his career at [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], initially as a centre-half before being converted into a striker by manager [[Dave Stringer]].

Late in the game with the \"Gunners\" leading by a single goal, the ball was kicked out of play by Arsenal to allow an injured teammate to receive treatment. Under the unwritten sportsmanship rule, Arsenal would expect the ball to be returned to them unhindered. However, Sutton chased the ball instead of allowing it to be thrown back to Arsenal and won a corner from his efforts. Blackburn scored from this corner and as a result Arsenal missed out on a lucrative place in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on [[goal difference]].

After a 0-0 draw in Munich, Aberdeen fell behind early on at home in the second leg before Neil Simpson equalised. Another goal for Bayern Munich seemed to put the game beyond Aberdeen, but two quick goals in the last 20 minutes gave Aberdeen a 3-2 victory. In the semi finals, Belgian team Waterschei of Genk were beaten 5-2 over two legs, and put Aberdeen into the final. Thousands of fans made the trip from Aberdeen to Gothenburg in Sweden to see the Scottish Cup holders play the Spaniards Real Madrid.

After a large preliminary round victory over Sion of Switzerland, the Dons knocked out Dinamo Tirana of Albania and Lech Poznan of Poland to set up a quarter final tie with the West Germans Bayern Munich. After a 0-0 draw in Munich, Aberdeen fell behind early on at home in the second leg before Neil Simpson equalised. Another goal for Bayern Munich seemed to put the game beyond Aberdeen, but two quick goals in the last 20 minutes gave Aberdeen a 3-2 victory. In the semi finals, Belgian team Waterschei of Genk were beaten 5-2 over two legs, and put Aberdeen into the final. Thousands of fans made the trip from Aberdeen to Gothenburg in Sweden to see the Scottish Cup holders play the Spaniards Real Madrid. In a wet evening at the Ullevi Stadium, Aberdeen won 2-1 after extra time to win their first European trophy.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! Round\n! Date\n! Opponent\n!

In 1940 a German bomb hit the school, causing slight damage. The Hall was leased to Thomas Tapping and his wife Bessie, who opened the private Beeston Hall School in 1948. In 1967 the school became an incorporated trust, and in 1970, following the death of [[Robert Wyndham Ketton-Cremer]], the last squire of Felbrigg, the school acquired the freehold and about 14 acres (5.7 ha) of land. Over the years the school has expanded; it is the biggest employer in the parish. It has also acquired other surrounding land including Beeston Hall Common, which it purchased from the parish of Beeston Regis.\n\n== Present school ==\nThe school is currently split into two parts;\n* Pre-Prep (ages 4 \u2013 6)\n* Prep (ages 7 \u2013 13)\n\nIts pupils take the [[Common Entrance Examination]], going on to a range of [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] such as [[Oundle School|Oundle]], [[Uppingham School|Uppingham]], [[Oakham School|Oakham]], [[Harrow School|Harrow]], [[Radley College|Radley]], [[Eton College|Eton]], [[Tudor Hall School, Banbury|Tudor Hall]], [[Norwich High School for Girls|Norwich High School]], [[Gresham's School|Gresham\u2019s]], [[The leys]] and [[Stowe School|Stowe]].<ref>http://www.tatler.com/guides/schools-guide/2016/prep/beeston-hall</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.beestonhall.co.uk/curriculum/senior-schools/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-05-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425064243/http://www.beestonhall.co.uk/curriculum/senior-schools/ |archive-date=2016-04-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2009 55 percent of Common Entrance papers were graded A or B, rising to 76 percent by 2013; in 2014 figures stood at 92 percent.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.beestonhall.co.uk/curriculum/achievements-results/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425062759/http://www.beestonhall.co.uk/curriculum/achievements-results/ |archive-date=25 April 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThere are 4 school houses.

In 1940 a German bomb hit the school, causing slight damage. The Hall was leased to Thomas Tapping and his wife Bessie, who opened the private Beeston Hall School in 1948. In 1967 the school became an incorporated trust, and in 1970, following the death of [[Robert Wyndham Ketton-Cremer]], the last squire of Felbrigg, the school acquired the freehold and about 14 acres (5.7 ha) of land. Over the years the school has expanded; it is the biggest employer in the parish. It has also acquired other surrounding land including Beeston Hall Common, which it purchased from the parish of Beeston Regis.\n\n== Present school ==\nThe school is currently split into two parts;\n* Pre-Prep (ages 4 \u2013 6)\n* Prep (ages 7 \u2013 13)\n\nIts pupils take the [[Common Entrance Examination]], going on to a range of [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]] such as [[Oundle School|Oundle]], [[Uppingham School|Uppingham]], [[Oakham School|Oakham]], [[Harrow School|Harrow]], [[Radley College|Radley]], [[Eton College|Eton]], [[Tudor Hall School, Banbury|Tudor Hall]], [[Norwich High School for Girls|Norwich High School]], [[Gresham's School|Gresham\u2019s]], [[The leys]] and [[Stowe School|Stowe]].<ref>http://www.tatler.com/guides/schools-guide/2016/prep/beeston-hall</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.beestonhall.co.uk/curriculum/senior-schools/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-05-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425064243/http://www.beestonhall.co.uk/curriculum/senior-schools/ |archive-date=2016-04-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2009 55 percent of Common Entrance papers were graded A or B, rising to 76 percent by 2013; in 2014 figures stood at 92 percent.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.beestonhall.co.uk/curriculum/achievements-results/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=15 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425062759/http://www.beestonhall.co.uk/curriculum/achievements-results/ |archive-date=25 April 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThere are 4 school houses.
