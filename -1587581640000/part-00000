One of its most popular artists was [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] It has been home to many artists, including [[Craig Mack]], [[French Montana]], [[Mase]], [[Machine Gun Kelly (rapper)|Machine Gun Kelly]], [[112 (band)|112]], [[Total (girl group)|Total]], [[The Lox]], [[Danity Kane]], [[Day26|Day 26]], [[Elephant Man (musician)|Elephant Man]] and many others.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings===\nAfter his climb from a non-paid [[internship]] to becoming an [[A&R]] executive at [[Uptown Records|Uptown]], Sean \"Puffy\" Combs was fired in mid-1993 by [[Andre Harrell]] and founded his own label, Bad Boy Records, in late 1993.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\"/> The label's first release was \"[[Flava in Ya Ear]]\" by [[Craig Mack]], followed quickly by Mack's debut album, ''[[Project Funk da World]]'' in 1994. On the heels of these releases came \"Juicy\" and ''[[Ready to Die]]'', the lead single and debut album from [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] (a.k.a. Biggie Smalls), released the same year. While Mack's album went Gold, ''Ready to Die'' achieved multi-platinum success. Dominating the charts in 1995, B.I.G. became one of the genre's biggest names of the day and Bad Boy's premier star. Also in 1995, the label continued its success with platinum releases by [[Total (group)|Total]] and [[Faith Evans]]. Bad Boy, meanwhile, staffed a bevy of in-house writer/producers,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nobel.osd.wednet.edu/wiki/pages/69D8c3R9r/Sean_Combs_Legacy_in_Hip_Hop.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022042254/http://nobel.osd.wednet.edu/wiki/pages/69D8c3R9r/Sean_Combs_Legacy_in_Hip_Hop.html |archivedate=2013-10-22 }}</ref> including: [[Easy Mo Bee]], [[Chucky Thompson]] and [[D-Dot|D Dot]]\u2014all of whom were instrumental in producing many of Bad Boy's most noted releases during this time.\n\n===Feud with Death Row===\n{{further|East Coast\u2013West Coast hip hop rivalry}}\nThe rapid success of The Notorious B.I.G., and Bad Boy as a company, raised some tensions, especially with the [[Los Angeles, California]]-based [[Death Row Records|Death Row]].  For 3 years leading up to 1995, [[West Coast hip hop]], dominated by labels such as Death Row, had been preeminent in mainstream Rap. [[Suge Knight]], CEO of Death Row, held Sean Combs responsible for the shooting death of his friend Jake Robles, allegedly at the hands of Sean Combs' bodyguard.  Tensions were heightened when Death Row signed [[2Pac]], who alleged that Bad Boy, notably The Notorious B.I.G. and Puff Daddy, had been complicit in the November 1994 shooting of Tupac in the lobby of Quad Studios in [[Times Square]].\n\nAfter the June 1996 release of 2Pac's \"[[Hit 'Em Up]]\", smearing Bad Boy, tensions escalated. 2Pac was shot in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] on September 7, 1996, and died September 13. Bad Boy issued a statement of condolences. On March 9, 1997, while Bad Boy were preparing the release of The Notorious B.I.G.'s double album ''[[Life After Death]]'', he was killed in Los Angeles, California.  Their deaths left many to speculate if the coastal hostility had been responsible for their deaths.  The police investigations were criticized by public and judicial sources. Both cases remain officially unsolved.\n\n===Life after The Notorious B.I.G. and rebuilding the label===\nPosthumously, Biggie's ''Life After Death'' reached number one on the Billboard Top 200. Its first two singles, \"Hypnotize\" and \"Mo Money, Mo Problems\" also topped the singles charts. The album eventually sold over 10 million copies in the U.S. alone, and is one of the highest selling rap albums ever in the U.S..\n\nIn 1996, Puff Daddy had begun recording his own solo debut album. The 1st single, \"Can't Nobody Hold Me Down,\" peaked at #1 on the Rap, R&B, and pop charts that spring. In response to Biggie's death, the label rush-released a Puff Daddy tribute song, \"[[I'll Be Missing You]]\", which featured Biggie's widow, Faith Evans, and Bad Boy's R&B singing group [[112 (group)|112]]. The single topped the charts for eleven weeks and became the hasty second single from Combs\u2019 album, ''[[No Way Out (Puff Daddy album)|No Way Out]]'', which was released in the summer and sold 7 million copies in the U.S.. [[Mase]], Combs\u2019 newest prot\u00e9g\u00e9, in the meantime was immediately thrust into the void that The Notorious B.I.G. left. His own debut album, ''[[Harlem World]]'', also released the same year, would go Quadruple Platinum. Due to the successive successes of ''Life After Death'', ''No Way Out'' and ''Harlem World'', by the end of 1997, Bad Boy as a label and brand name had hit a commercial peak. During this time, the label began to promote its latest signing [[The L.O.X.]], who had been prominently featured on various Bad Boy releases that year. Highly anticipated, their 1998 debut album, ''[[Money, Power & Respect]]'' was certified Platinum by the RIAA. Shortly thereafter, the group departed the label and entered into a long-standing publishing dispute with Combs over the latter receiving 50% of their publishing that would continue until 2005.\n\nIn 1998, Combs decided to expand Bad Boy's roster to genres other than hip-hop and R&B, and subsequently signed [[Fuzzbubble]] to the label as its 1st rock act.<ref name=\"MTV\">{{cite news|title= Puffy, Jimmy Page To Share \"SNL\" Stage |url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1427377/19980506/puff_daddy.jhtml |publisher= [[MTV News]]. [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] |accessdate= 13 August 2008}}</ref> The group appeared on the rock remix of Puff Daddy's \"[[It's All About the Benjamins]]\", but parted ways with the label before releasing a full-length album.<ref>{{cite web|first= Gary |last= Glauber |work= [[PopMatters]] |title= Fuzzbubble: Demos, Out-takes and Rarities |url= http://www.popmatters.com/review/fuzzbubble-demos/ |date= 5 January 2003 |accessdate= 15 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the years to follow, Bad Boy saw a commercial decline. In 1999, Mase became religious and abruptly retired from the business, leaving a serious dent in the company, especially since his 2nd album had just been released. Bad Boy found some success with [[Shyne]], a young rapper from [[Brooklyn]], who garnered generally mixed reviews for his deep voice and slow flow\u2014which many considered to be too reminiscent to, and perhaps a rip-off of The Notorious B.I.G., meanwhile, Combs' later albums failed to generate the same kind of acclaim that his debut had. In an attempt to further market himself, he underwent several name changes; from \"Puff Daddy\" to \"Puffy\" to \"P. Diddy,\" to simply just \"Diddy\" then shortly Diddy- Dirty Money.\" But with the split of the group he abruptly returned to \"Diddy.\"\n\nAs the 2000s emerged, Bad Boy had noticeably floundered. Many of its more noted acts would eventually vacate the label, while those who remained saw their album sales dwindle as time went on. In spite of continually releasing new material, and various attempts at building artists to the status of Bad Boy's The Notorious B.I.G., few proved as successful as the company hoped.\n\n[[Southern rap]] duo [[8Ball & MJG]] released an album called ''Living Legends'' to some success in 2004, prompting the creation of Bad Boy South\u2014which would eventually house acts such as [[Yung Joc]]. In 2002, Combs\u2019 participated in [[MTV]]'s [[Making The Band|Making The Band 2]], which spun off the Bad Boy assembled act, [[Da Band]]. Their MTV exposure lead to a Gold selling debut album. At this time, the label also signed a rapper named [[Aasim]], whose Bad Boy debut (as of 2013) still has not been released.\n\n===Resurgence===\nBad Boy saw its fortunes improve in 2005,<ref>Tamara Conniff and Bill Werde (October 4, 2006). [http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/57050/diddy-the-saga-continues Diddy: The Saga Continues]. Billboard.com. Accessed 2006-11-22.</ref> with the success of releases from new signees: [[Cassie Ventura|Cassie]] and [[Yung Joc]] (both of whom would score top five singles/debut albums). Also in 2006, Bad Boy hit paydirt with [[Making The Band|Making The Band 3's]] [[Danity Kane]], whose debut album topped the charts at #1 (the label's first chart topping album since the [[Bad Boys II (soundtrack)|Bad Boys II soundtrack]] three years prior), and spun off a top five single. Their second album, [[Welcome to the Dollhouse (album)|Welcome to the Dollhouse]] also debuted at #1, and contained the group's second top ten single \"[[Damaged (Danity Kane song)|Damaged]]\". Diddy also signed [[Day26]] and [[Donnie Klang]] to the label.\n\nHowever, by 2009, Combs had dissolved Danity Kane, terminating Aubrey O'Day's, D. Woods', Shannon Bex's and Aundrea Fimbres' contracts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1609473/20090417/kane__danity.jhtml|title=Danity Kane\u2019s Aundrea Fimbres Fired By Diddy|work=MTV News|accessdate=4 March 2015}}</ref> Dawn Richard remained signed working as solo artist and songwriter for Bad Boy. In March 2009, it was reported that Richard and Combs were assembling a new girl group but later formed [[Diddy \u2013 Dirty Money]], composed of Combs, Richard and a singer-songwriter named [[Kalenna Harper]]. In April 2009, Bad Boy also signed Red Cafe.\n\nIn September 2009, it was announced that Combs would be leaving [[Warner Music Group|Warner]], inking a new deal with Universal's [[Interscope]]. Under the terms of the new deal, Combs rebooted the Bad Boy name and trademark, to be operated through Interscope.  The previous Bad Boy catalog and roster, however, remains under the control of Warner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267267/diddy-exits-warner-music-last-train-coming-on-interscope|title=Diddy Exits Warner, 'Last Train' Coming On Interscope|work=Billboard|accessdate=4 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===2010\u2013present===\nIn 2010, Diddy offered Mase a 1-year release from Bad Boy to settle their differences after the 2009 incident with Mase wanting to be released from Bad Boy. With this Mase decided to retire from rap for good, although he was to be reassigned to Bad Boy after his year break was done. In 2011, under his new deal with [[Interscope-Geffen-A&M]], Diddy stated he was looking for new talent to add to his new Bad Boy roster. [[Jay Electronica]], who had close ties with Diddy, was originally planned to be signed to the label but had signed with [[Jay-Z]]'s [[Roc Nation]] imprint instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ruthlessblogs.com/2011/04/11/tyler-the-creator-speaks-on-odd-future-bidding-war/|title=Ruthlessblogs.com|accessdate=4 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402101711/http://ruthlessblogs.com/2011/04/11/tyler-the-creator-speaks-on-odd-future-bidding-war/|archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://yodonbleekraps.com/2011/03/21/is-lil-b-signing-to-diddys-bad-boy-records/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727155617/http://yodonbleekraps.com/2011/03/21/is-lil-b-signing-to-diddys-bad-boy-records/ |archivedate=2011-07-27 }}</ref> [[Machine Gun Kelly (rapper)|Machine Gun Kelly]] announced that he signed to Bad Boy/Interscope on August 3, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/posts/machine-gun-kelly-announces-deal-bad-boyinterscope-they-understood-our-idea|title=Machine Gun Kelly Announces Deal With Bad Boy/Interscope: \u2018They Understood Our Idea\u2019|work=Vibe|accessdate=4 March 2015}}</ref> [[French Montana]] and [[Los (rapper)|Los]] also were announced as signees to the label in 2012.\n\nOn April 25, 2012, Mase featured alongside Diddy on [[Wale (rapper)|Wale]]'s \"Slight Work\" remix, marking the first appearance of the Harlem rapper on record since 2010. Rumors began to start that Mase, as well as singer [[Omarion]], were both signing to Rick Ross' [[Maybach Music Group]]. It was later revealed that Bad Boy artist French Montana was the reason Mase was making his third comeback. According to Montana, Mase is serving as an [[A&R]] representative on Montana's forthcoming Bad Boy debut, \"[[Excuse My French (album)|Excuse My French]],\" as well as appearing on the remix of Montana's \"Everything's a Go.\" \"I'm not sure what kind of decisions he's going to make,\" Montana says, \"[but] I would love to see him in my camp.\" Mase is currently resigned to Bad Boy Records but has yet to announce whether he is resigned as part of a joint venture deal between Bad Boy and MMG. He later announced he had gotten his release from Bad Boy.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} In April 2013, Cassie released her first full-length project seven years after her debut album, a mixtape titled ''[[RockaByeBaby]]'', to positive reception.

One of its most popular artists was [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] It has been home to many artists, including [[Craig Mack]], [[French Montana]], [[Mase]], [[Machine Gun Kelly (rapper)|Machine Gun Kelly]], [[112 (band)|112]], [[Total (girl group)|Total]], [[The Lox]], [[Danity Kane]], [[Day26|Day 26]], [[Elephant Man (musician)|Elephant Man]] and many others.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings===\nAfter his climb from a non-paid [[internship]] to becoming an [[A&R]] executive at [[Uptown Records|Uptown]], Sean \"Puffy\" Combs was fired in mid-1993 by [[Andre Harrell]] and founded his own label, Bad Boy Records, in late 1993.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\"/> The label's first release was \"[[Flava in Ya Ear]]\" by [[Craig Mack]], followed quickly by Mack's debut album, ''[[Project Funk da World]]'' in 1994. On the heels of these releases came \"Juicy\" and ''[[Ready to Die]]'', the lead single and debut album from [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] (a.k.a. Biggie Smalls), released the same year. While Mack's album went Gold, ''Ready to Die'' achieved multi-platinum success. Dominating the charts in 1995, B.I.G. became one of the genre's biggest names of the day and Bad Boy's premier star. Also in 1995, the label continued its success with platinum releases by [[Total (group)|Total]] and [[Faith Evans]]. Bad Boy, meanwhile, staffed a bevy of in-house writer/producers,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nobel.osd.wednet.edu/wiki/pages/69D8c3R9r/Sean_Combs_Legacy_in_Hip_Hop.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022042254/http://nobel.osd.wednet.edu/wiki/pages/69D8c3R9r/Sean_Combs_Legacy_in_Hip_Hop.html |archivedate=2013-10-22 }}</ref> including: [[Easy Mo Bee]], [[Chucky Thompson]] and [[D-Dot|D Dot]]\u2014all of whom were instrumental in producing many of Bad Boy's most noted releases during this time.\n\n===Feud with Death Row===\n{{further|East Coast\u2013West Coast hip hop rivalry}}\nThe rapid success of The Notorious B.I.G., and Bad Boy as a company, raised some tensions, especially with the [[Los Angeles, California]]-based [[Death Row Records|Death Row]].  For 3 years leading up to 1995, [[West Coast hip hop]], dominated by labels such as Death Row, had been preeminent in mainstream Rap. [[Suge Knight]], CEO of Death Row, held Sean Combs responsible for the shooting death of his friend Jake Robles, allegedly at the hands of Sean Combs' bodyguard.  Tensions were heightened when Death Row signed [[2Pac]], who alleged that Bad Boy, notably The Notorious B.I.G. and Puff Daddy, had been complicit in the November 1994 shooting of Tupac in the lobby of Quad Studios in [[Times Square]].\n\nAfter the June 1996 release of 2Pac's \"[[Hit 'Em Up]]\", smearing Bad Boy, tensions escalated. 2Pac was shot in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] on September 7, 1996, and died September 13. Bad Boy issued a statement of condolences. On March 9, 1997, while Bad Boy were preparing the release of The Notorious B.I.G.'s double album ''[[Life After Death]]'', he was killed in Los Angeles, California.  Their deaths left many to speculate if the coastal hostility had been responsible for their deaths.  The police investigations were criticized by public and judicial sources. Both cases remain officially unsolved.\n\n===Life after The Notorious B.I.G. and rebuilding the label===\nPosthumously, Biggie's ''Life After Death'' reached number one on the Billboard Top 200. Its first two singles, \"Hypnotize\" and \"Mo Money, Mo Problems\" also topped the singles charts. The album eventually sold over 10 million copies in the U.S. alone, and is one of the highest selling rap albums ever in the U.S..\n\nIn 1996, Puff Daddy had begun recording his own solo debut album. The 1st single, \"Can't Nobody Hold Me Down,\" peaked at #1 on the Rap, R&B, and pop charts that spring. In response to Biggie's death, the label rush-released a Puff Daddy tribute song, \"[[I'll Be Missing You]]\", which featured Biggie's widow, Faith Evans, and Bad Boy's R&B singing group [[112 (group)|112]]. The single topped the charts for eleven weeks and became the hasty second single from Combs\u2019 album, ''[[No Way Out (Puff Daddy album)|No Way Out]]'', which was released in the summer and sold 7 million copies in the U.S.. [[Mase]], Combs\u2019 newest prot\u00e9g\u00e9, in the meantime was immediately thrust into the void that The Notorious B.I.G. left. His own debut album, ''[[Harlem World]]'', also released the same year, would go Quadruple Platinum. Due to the successive successes of ''Life After Death'', ''No Way Out'' and ''Harlem World'', by the end of 1997, Bad Boy as a label and brand name had hit a commercial peak. During this time, the label began to promote its latest signing [[The L.O.X.]], who had been prominently featured on various Bad Boy releases that year. Highly anticipated, their 1998 debut album, ''[[Money, Power & Respect]]'' was certified Platinum by the RIAA. Shortly thereafter, the group departed the label and entered into a long-standing publishing dispute with Combs over the latter receiving 50% of their publishing that would continue until 2005.\n\nIn 1998, Combs decided to expand Bad Boy's roster to genres other than hip-hop and R&B, and subsequently signed [[Fuzzbubble]] to the label as its 1st rock act.<ref name=\"MTV\">{{cite news|title= Puffy, Jimmy Page To Share \"SNL\" Stage |url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1427377/19980506/puff_daddy.jhtml |publisher= [[MTV News]].

In 1999, Mase became religious and abruptly retired from the business, leaving a serious dent in the company, especially since his 2nd album had just been released. Bad Boy found some success with [[Shyne]], a young rapper from [[Brooklyn]], who garnered generally mixed reviews for his deep voice and slow flow\u2014which many considered to be too reminiscent to, and perhaps a rip-off of The Notorious B.I.G., meanwhile, Combs' later albums failed to generate the same kind of acclaim that his debut had. In an attempt to further market himself, he underwent several name changes; from \"Puff Daddy\" to \"Puffy\" to \"P. Diddy,\" to simply just \"Diddy\" then shortly Diddy- Dirty Money.\" But with the split of the group he abruptly returned to \"Diddy.\"\n\nAs the 2000s emerged, Bad Boy had noticeably floundered. Many of its more noted acts would eventually vacate the label, while those who remained saw their album sales dwindle as time went on. In spite of continually releasing new material, and various attempts at building artists to the status of Bad Boy's The Notorious B.I.G., few proved as successful as the company hoped.\n\n[[Southern rap]] duo [[8Ball & MJG]] released an album called ''Living Legends'' to some success in 2004, prompting the creation of Bad Boy South\u2014which would eventually house acts such as [[Yung Joc]]. In 2002, Combs\u2019 participated in [[MTV]]'s [[Making The Band|Making The Band 2]], which spun off the Bad Boy assembled act, [[Da Band]]. Their MTV exposure lead to a Gold selling debut album. At this time, the label also signed a rapper named [[Aasim]], whose Bad Boy debut (as of 2013) still has not been released.\n\n===Resurgence===\nBad Boy saw its fortunes improve in 2005,<ref>Tamara Conniff and Bill Werde (October 4, 2006).

Accessed 2006-11-22.</ref> with the success of releases from new signees: [[Cassie Ventura|Cassie]] and [[Yung Joc]] (both of whom would score top five singles/debut albums). Also in 2006, Bad Boy hit paydirt with [[Making The Band|Making The Band 3's]] [[Danity Kane]], whose debut album topped the charts at #1 (the label's first chart topping album since the [[Bad Boys II (soundtrack)|Bad Boys II soundtrack]] three years prior), and spun off a top five single. Their second album, [[Welcome to the Dollhouse (album)|Welcome to the Dollhouse]] also debuted at #1, and contained the group's second top ten single \"[[Damaged (Danity Kane song)|Damaged]]\". Diddy also signed [[Day26]] and [[Donnie Klang]] to the label.\n\nHowever, by 2009, Combs had dissolved Danity Kane, terminating Aubrey O'Day's, D. Woods', Shannon Bex's and Aundrea Fimbres' contracts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1609473/20090417/kane__danity.jhtml|title=Danity Kane\u2019s Aundrea Fimbres Fired By Diddy|work=MTV News|accessdate=4 March 2015}}</ref> Dawn Richard remained signed working as solo artist and songwriter for Bad Boy. In March 2009, it was reported that Richard and Combs were assembling a new girl group but later formed [[Diddy \u2013 Dirty Money]], composed of Combs, Richard and a singer-songwriter named [[Kalenna Harper]]. In April 2009, Bad Boy also signed Red Cafe.\n\nIn September 2009, it was announced that Combs would be leaving [[Warner Music Group|Warner]], inking a new deal with Universal's [[Interscope]]. Under the terms of the new deal, Combs rebooted the Bad Boy name and trademark, to be operated through Interscope.  The previous Bad Boy catalog and roster, however, remains under the control of Warner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267267/diddy-exits-warner-music-last-train-coming-on-interscope|title=Diddy Exits Warner, 'Last Train' Coming On Interscope|work=Billboard|accessdate=4 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===2010\u2013present===\nIn 2010, Diddy offered Mase a 1-year release from Bad Boy to settle their differences after the 2009 incident with Mase wanting to be released from Bad Boy. With this Mase decided to retire from rap for good, although he was to be reassigned to Bad Boy after his year break was done. In 2011, under his new deal with [[Interscope-Geffen-A&M]], Diddy stated he was looking for new talent to add to his new Bad Boy roster. [[Jay Electronica]], who had close ties with Diddy, was originally planned to be signed to the label but had signed with [[Jay-Z]]'s [[Roc Nation]] imprint instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ruthlessblogs.com/2011/04/11/tyler-the-creator-speaks-on-odd-future-bidding-war/|title=Ruthlessblogs.com|accessdate=4 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402101711/http://ruthlessblogs.com/2011/04/11/tyler-the-creator-speaks-on-odd-future-bidding-war/|archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://yodonbleekraps.com/2011/03/21/is-lil-b-signing-to-diddys-bad-boy-records/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727155617/http://yodonbleekraps.com/2011/03/21/is-lil-b-signing-to-diddys-bad-boy-records/ |archivedate=2011-07-27 }}</ref> [[Machine Gun Kelly (rapper)|Machine Gun Kelly]] announced that he signed to Bad Boy/Interscope on August 3, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/posts/machine-gun-kelly-announces-deal-bad-boyinterscope-they-understood-our-idea|title=Machine Gun Kelly Announces Deal With Bad Boy/Interscope: \u2018They Understood Our Idea\u2019|work=Vibe|accessdate=4 March 2015}}</ref> [[French Montana]] and [[Los (rapper)|Los]] also were announced as signees to the label in 2012.\n\nOn April 25, 2012, Mase featured alongside Diddy on [[Wale (rapper)|Wale]]'s \"Slight Work\" remix, marking the first appearance of the Harlem rapper on record since 2010. Rumors began to start that Mase, as well as singer [[Omarion]], were both signing to Rick Ross' [[Maybach Music Group]]. It was later revealed that Bad Boy artist French Montana was the reason Mase was making his third comeback. According to Montana, Mase is serving as an [[A&R]] representative on Montana's forthcoming Bad Boy debut, \"[[Excuse My French (album)|Excuse My French]],\" as well as appearing on the remix of Montana's \"Everything's a Go.\" \"I'm not sure what kind of decisions he's going to make,\" Montana says, \"[but] I would love to see him in my camp.\" Mase is currently resigned to Bad Boy Records but has yet to announce whether he is resigned as part of a joint venture deal between Bad Boy and MMG. He later announced he had gotten his release from Bad Boy.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} In April 2013, Cassie released her first full-length project seven years after her debut album, a mixtape titled ''[[RockaByeBaby]]'', to positive reception.

Terry Hartle of the ''Christian Science Monitor'' wrote that Andersen's ''These Few Precious Days:  The Last Year of Jack with Jackie'' was \"fascinating and insightful\" and ''Kirkus Reviews'' determined that ''The Good Son''was \"sensitive and astute, intimate\" with \"the power to mesmerize.\" ''Vanity Fair'' called Andersen's 2016 book ''Game of Crowns'' \"catnip for royal watchers.\"\n\n==Works==\n*''The Name Game'' (1977)\n*''Father'' (1983)\n*''The Serpent's Tooth'' (1986)\n*''Young Kate: Katharine Hepburn and the Making of an American Legend'' (1988)\n*''The Best of Everything'' (with John Marion) (1989)\n*''Citizen Jane'' (1990)\n*''Madonna: Unauthorized'' (1991)\n*''Jagger: Unauthorized'' (1993)\n*''Michael Jackson: Unauthorized'' (1994)\n*''Jack and Jackie: Portrait of an American Marriage'' (1996)\n*''An Affair to Remember'' (1997)\n*''Jackie After Jack: Portrait of the Lady'' (1998)\n*''The Day Diana Died'' (1998)\n*''Bill and Hillary: The Marriage'' (1999)\n*''The Day John Died'' (2000)\n*''Diana's Boys: William and Harry and the Mother They Loved'' (2001)\n*''George and Laura: Portrait of an American Marriage'' (2002)\n*''Sweet Caroline: Last Child of Camelot'' (2003)\n*''American Evita: Hillary Clinton's Path to Power'' (2004)\n*''Barbra: The Way She Is'' (2006)\n*''After Diana: William, Harry, Charles, and the Royal House of Windsor'' (2007)\n*''Somewhere in Heaven: The Remarkable Love Story of Dana and Christopher Reeve'' (2008)\n*''Barack and Michelle|Barack and Michelle: Portrait of an American Marriage'' (2009) <ref>http://www.harpercollins.com/author/microsite/?authorid=205 Harpercollins.com</ref>\n*''William and Kate: A Royal Love Story'' (2010)\n*''These Few Precious Days: The Final Year of Jack with Jackie'' (2013)\n*''Game of Crowns: Elizabeth, Camilla, Kate, and the Throne'' (2016)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb name|0026114}}\n*[http://www.bookreporter.com/authors/au-andersen-christopher.asp \"Christopher Andersen\", ''Bookreporter'']\n*[http://coaches.aol.com/kids-and-family/feature/_a/christopher-anderson-after-diana/20070627170209990001 'After Diana' Q&A With Christopher Andersen, CAROLINE HOWARD]\n* {{C-SPAN|Christopher Andersen}}\n\n<!--Associated Press, Aug. 11, 1998, July 20, 1999, July 22, 1999, July 11, 2000, July 28, 2000, Aug. 24, 2001, June 21, 2002, Aug. 31, 2002,Jan. 11, 2003, Nov. 2, 2003; \nbookreporter.com; \n''The Boston Globe'', July 8, 1993; August 10, 1996, Aug. 4, 1999, Nov. 22, 2003; \n''Chicago Sun-Times'', June 24, 1996, June 16, 2005; \n''Contemporary Authors'' vols. 14,31,127; \n''Cosmopolitan'', March 1998; \n''Detroit Free Press'', Nov. 16, 2003; \n''Ladies Home Journal'', August 2000, August 2008;\n''New York Magazine'', Feb. 16, 1998;\n''The New York Times'',  Sept. 13, 1982, Aug. 7, 1988,  June 10, 1990, Oct. 18, 1991, July 14, 1996, Mar. 1, 1998, Aug. 14, 1998, Sept. 13, 1998, Oct. 4, 1998, Aug. 22, 1999, Sept. 16, 2001, Sept.23, 2001, Nov. 9, 2003, July 25, 2004, April 16, 2006, July 27, 2008;\n''Newsweek'', May 5, 1997, Feb. 23, 1998;\n''Parade'', Jan. 31, 1988;\n''People'', Nov. 25, 2002, June 18, 2007; \n''Redbook'', September 1, 2001;\n''Time'',  August 19, 1996, April 21, 1997,;\n''USA Today,'' July 7, 2008;\n''US News & World Report'', May 19, 1997; \n''Vanity Fair'', Sept. 2003;\n''Washington Post'',  Aug.7, 1988, Aug. 13, 1998, Aug. 21, 2001-->\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Andersen, Christopher}}\n[[Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni]]\n[[Category:1949 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American biographers]]\n[[Category:Male biographers]]\n[[Category:Place of birth missing (living people)]]\n[[Category:Celebrity biographers]]\n", "name_user": "91.110.94.158", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Andersen"}

Each is a [[constitutional monarchy]], wherein the sovereign inherits his or her office, usually keeping it until death or [[abdication]], and is bound by laws and customs in the exercise of their powers. Ten of these monarchies are independent states; they equally share Queen [[Elizabeth II]], who resides primarily in the [[United Kingdom]], as their respective sovereign, making them part of a global group known as the [[Commonwealth realm]]s. The others are [[dependent territory|dependencies]] of three European monarchies. As such, none of the monarchies in the [[Americas]] have a permanently residing monarch.\n\nThese crowns continue a history of monarchy in the Americas that reaches back to before [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]]. Both tribal and more complex [[pre-Columbian]] societies existed under monarchical forms of government, with some expanding to form vast [[empire]]s under a central [[Monarch|king]] figure, while others did the same with a decentralized collection of tribal regions under a hereditary [[Tribal chief|chieftain]]. None of the contemporary monarchies, however, are descended from those pre-colonial royal systems, instead either having their historical roots in, or still being a part of, the current [[Monarchies in Europe|European monarchies]] that spread their reach across the [[Atlantic Ocean]], beginning in the mid 14th century.\n\nFrom that date on, through the [[Age of Discovery]], European colonization brought extensive American territory under the control of Europe's monarchs, though the majority of these colonies subsequently gained independence from their rulers. Some did so via armed conflict with their mother countries, as in the [[American Revolution]] and the [[Latin American wars of independence]], usually severing all ties to the overseas monarchies in the process. Others gained full sovereignty by legislative paths, such as [[Canada]]'s [[patriation]] of its constitution from the [[United Kingdom]]. A certain number of former colonies became [[republic]]s immediately upon achieving self-governance. The remainder continued with [[Endemism|endemic]] constitutional monarchies\u2014in the cases of [[Haiti]], [[Mexico]], and [[Brazil]]\u2014with their own resident monarch and, for places such as Canada and some island states in the [[Caribbean]], sharing their monarch with their former [[metropole]], the most recently created being [[Monarchy of Belize|that of Belize]] in 1981.\n\n==Current monarchies==\n===American monarchies===\n{{main|Lists of monarchs in the Americas}}\nWhile the incumbent of each of the American monarchies is the same person and resides predominantly in Europe, each of the states are [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] and thus have distinct local monarchies [[Seat (legal entity)|seated]] in their respective [[Capital (political)|capital]]s, with the monarch's day-to-day governmental and ceremonial duties generally carried out by an appointed local [[viceroy]].\n\n====Antigua and Barbuda====\n{{main|Monarchy of Antigua and Barbuda}}\nThe monarchy of [[Antigua and Barbuda]] has its roots in the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish monarchy]], under the authority of which the islands were first colonized in the late 15th century, and later the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarchy]], as a [[Crown colony]].

The [[Caribbean]] islands were colonised under the authority or the direct instruction of a number of European monarchs, mostly [[Monarchy of England|English]], [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch]], or [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish]], throughout the first half of the 17th century.

By 1833, however, the islands were under full British control. The South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands were discovered by Captain [[James Cook]] for George III in January 1775, and from 1843 were governed by the British Crown-in-Council through the Falkland Islands, an arrangement that stood until the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands were incorporated as a distinct British overseas territory in 1985.

Each is a [[constitutional monarchy]], wherein the sovereign inherits his or her office, usually keeping it until death or [[abdication]], and is bound by laws and customs in the exercise of their powers. Ten of these monarchies are independent states; they equally share Queen [[Elizabeth II]], who resides primarily in the [[United Kingdom]], as their respective sovereign, making them part of a global group known as the [[Commonwealth realm]]s. The others are [[dependent territory|dependencies]] of three European monarchies. As such, none of the monarchies in the [[Americas]] have a permanently residing monarch.\n\nThese crowns continue a history of monarchy in the Americas that reaches back to before [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]]. Both tribal and more complex [[pre-Columbian]] societies existed under monarchical forms of government, with some expanding to form vast [[empire]]s under a central [[Monarch|king]] figure, while others did the same with a decentralized collection of tribal regions under a hereditary [[Tribal chief|chieftain]]. None of the contemporary monarchies, however, are descended from those pre-colonial royal systems, instead either having their historical roots in, or still being a part of, the current [[Monarchies in Europe|European monarchies]] that spread their reach across the [[Atlantic Ocean]], beginning in the mid 14th century.\n\nFrom that date on, through the [[Age of Discovery]], European colonization brought extensive American territory under the control of Europe's monarchs, though the majority of these colonies subsequently gained independence from their rulers. Some did so via armed conflict with their mother countries, as in the [[American Revolution]] and the [[Latin American wars of independence]], usually severing all ties to the overseas monarchies in the process. Others gained full sovereignty by legislative paths, such as [[Canada]]'s [[patriation]] of its constitution from the [[United Kingdom]]. A certain number of former colonies became [[republic]]s immediately upon achieving self-governance. The remainder continued with [[Endemism|endemic]] constitutional monarchies\u2014in the cases of [[Haiti]], [[Mexico]], and [[Brazil]]\u2014with their own resident monarch and, for places such as Canada and some island states in the [[Caribbean]], sharing their monarch with their former [[metropole]], the most recently created being [[Monarchy of Belize|that of Belize]] in 1981.\n\n==Current monarchies==\n===American monarchies===\n{{main|Lists of monarchs in the Americas}}\nWhile the incumbent of each of the American monarchies is the same person and resides predominantly in Europe, each of the states are [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] and thus have distinct local monarchies [[Seat (legal entity)|seated]] in their respective [[Capital (political)|capital]]s, with the monarch's day-to-day governmental and ceremonial duties generally carried out by an appointed local [[viceroy]].\n\n====Antigua and Barbuda====\n{{main|Monarchy of Antigua and Barbuda}}\nThe monarchy of [[Antigua and Barbuda]] has its roots in the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish monarchy]], under the authority of which the islands were first colonized in the late 15th century, and later the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarchy]], as a [[Crown colony]].

The [[Caribbean]] islands were colonised under the authority or the direct instruction of a number of European monarchs, mostly [[Monarchy of England|English]], [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch]], or [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish]], throughout the first half of the 17th century.

By 1833, however, the islands were under full British control. The South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands were discovered by Captain [[James Cook]] for George III in January 1775, and from 1843 were governed by the British Crown-in-Council through the Falkland Islands, an arrangement that stood until the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands were incorporated as a distinct British overseas territory in 1985.

The Spanish monarchy, however, refused to recognise the new state, and decreed that it would allow no other European prince to take the throne of Mexico. Thus, the Mexican [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] was crowned as Augustine I on 19 May 1822, with an official decree of confirmation issued two days following. Only a few months later, Augustine dissolved a factious congress, thereby prompting an enraged [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] to mount a coup, which led to the declaration of a republic on 1 December 1822. In order to end the unrest, Augustine abdicated on 19 March 1823 and left the country, and the Mexican monarchy was abolished. After hearing that the situation in Mexico had only grown worse since his abdication, Iturbide returned from England on 11 May 1824, but was detained upon setting foot in Mexico and, without trial, was executed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/379167/Mexico/27357/The-Mexican-Empire-1821-23 |title=History \u00bb Independence \u00bb The Mexican Empire, 1821\u201323 |accessdate=2 January 2009 |work= |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |date=}}</ref>\n[[File:X-Large Portrait of Maximiliano.jpg|170px|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Maximilian I of Mexico]], by [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter]]]]\n\n[[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]], elected as [[President of Mexico]] on 19 January 1858, suspended all repayments on Mexico's foreign debts (save those owed to the [[United States]]), leading France, the United Kingdom, and Spain to send a joint expeditionary force that took [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] in December 1861. Ju\u00e1rez then repaid the debts, after which British and Spanish troops withdrew, but Emperor [[Napoleon III of France]] used the situation as a pretext to overthrow the republic and install a monarch friendly to the interests of France.

Regardless, Maximilian was still viewed as a French puppet, and an illegitimate leader of the country. As well, at the end of the [[American Civil War]], US troops moved to the Mexico-US border as part of a planned invasion, seeing the establishment of the Second Mexican Empire as an infringement on their [[Monroe Doctrine]].
