The northern and western sides consist of stony but fertile [[plain]]s, which are well cultivated and produce luxuriant crops of grain, with some cotton, [[vine]]s, [[almond]]s, [[olive]]s and [[ficus|figs]],<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> but the most characteristic crop of Aegina today (2000s) is [[pistachio]]. Economically, the [[Sea sponge|sponge]] fisheries are of notable importance. The southern volcanic part of the island is rugged and mountainous, and largely barren. Its highest rise is the conical [[Mount Oros]] (531 m) in the south, and the Panhellenian ridge stretches northward with narrow fertile valleys on either side.\n\nThe beaches are also a popular tourist attraction. [[Hydrofoil]] ferries from [[Piraeus]] take only forty minutes to reach Aegina; the regular ferry takes about an hour, with ticket prices for adults within the 4\u201315 [[euro]] range. There are regular bus services from Aegina town to destinations throughout the [[List of islands of Greece|island]] such as [[Agia Marina, Aegina|Agia Marina]].

J. Evans, in ''Journal of Hellenic Studies'', vol. xiii. p. 195  {{When|date=February 2011}}</ref> It is probable that the island was not doricised before the 9th century BC.\n\nOne of the earliest historical facts is its membership in the [[Amphictyony of Calauria|Amphictyony]] or [[League of Calauria]], attested around the 8th century BC. This ostensibly religious league included\u2014besides Aegina\u2014[[Athens]], the [[Minyans|Minyan]] (Boeotian) [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenos]], [[Troezen]], [[Ermioni|Hermione]], [[Nauplia]], and [[Prasiae]]. It was probably an organisation of city-states that were still Mycenaean, for the purpose of suppressing [[piracy]] in the Aegean that began as a result of the decay of the naval supremacy of the Mycenaean princes.\n\nAegina seems to have belonged to the [[Eretrian]] league during the [[Lelantine War]]; this, perhaps, may explain the war with [[Samos]], a major member of the rival Chalcidian league during the reign of King [[Amphicrates]] (Herod. iii. 59), i.e. not later than the earlier half of the 7th century BC.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n===Coinage and sea power (7th\u20135th centuries BC)===\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align     = right\n | width = 250\n | header = Coins of Aegina\n | footer =\n | image1 = Aegina Stater achaic.jpg\n | alt1 =\n | caption1 = Silver [[stater]] of Aegina, 550\u2013530&nbsp;BC.

It is usually stated on the authority of [[Ephorus]], that [[Pheidon]] of Argos established a mint in Aegina, the first city-state to issue coins in Europe, the Aeginetic [[stater]]. One stamped stater (having the mark of some authority in the form of a picture or words) can be seen in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale]] of Paris. It is an [[electrum]] stater of a turtle, an animal sacred to Aphrodite, struck at Aegina that dates from 700&nbsp;BC.<ref>British Museum Catalogue 11 \u2013 [https://docs.google.com/file/d/0ByKcmdYWS2bZWVpFLWRtVXd0Ulk/edit?pli=1 Attica Megaris Aegina], 700 \u2013 550 BC, plate [http://www.snible.org/coins/bmc/attica/XXIII.jpg XXIII].</ref> Therefore, it is thought that the Aeginetes, within 30 or 40&nbsp;years of the invention of coinage in [[Asia Minor]] by the [[Ionia]]n Greeks or the [[Lydians]] (c. 630 BC), might have been the ones to introduce coinage to the Western world. The fact that the Aeginetic standard of weights and measures (developed during the mid-7th century) was one of the two standards in general use in the Greek world (the other being the Euboic-Attic) is sufficient evidence of the early commercial importance of the island.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> The Aeginetic weight standard of about 12.3 grams was widely adopted in the Greek world during the 7th century BC. The Aeginetic stater was divided into three drachmae of 4.1 grams of silver. Staters depicting a sea-turtle were struck up to the end of the 5th century BC. Following the end of the [[Peloponnesian War]], 404&nbsp;BC, it was replaced by the land [[tortoise]].\n\nDuring the naval expansion of Aegina during the [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic Period]], Kydonia was an ideal maritime stop for Aegina's fleet on its way to other [[Mediterranean]] ports controlled by the emerging sea-power Aegina.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10881/cydonia.html|title=The Modern Antiquarian: Cydonia|website=www.themodernantiquarian.com}}</ref> During the next century Aegina was one of the three principal states trading at the [[Marketplace|emporium]] of [[Naucratis]] in Egypt, and it was the only Greek state near Europe that had a share in this factory.<ref>Herodotus ii. 178</ref> At the beginning of the 5th century BC it seems to have been an entrep\u00f4t of the [[Black Sea|Pontic]] grain trade, which, at a later date, became an Athenian monopoly.<ref>Herodotus vii. 147</ref>\n\nUnlike the other commercial states of the 7th and 6th centuries BC, such as [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], [[Chalcis]], [[Eretria]] and [[Miletus]], Aegina did not found any colonies. The settlements to which Strabo refers (viii. 376) cannot be regarded as any real exceptions to this statement.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n===Rivalry with Athens (5th century BC)===\nThe known history of Aegina is almost exclusively a history of its relations with the neighbouring state of Athens, which began to compete with the [[thalassocracy]] (sea power) of Aegina about the beginning of the 6th century BC. [[Solon]] passed laws limiting Aeginetan commerce in Attica. The legendary history of these relations, as recorded by Herodotus (v. 79\u201389; vi. 49\u201351, 73, 85\u201394), involves critical problems of some difficulty and interest. He traces the hostility of the two states back to a dispute about the images of the goddesses [[Damia (goddess)|Damia]] and [[Auxesia]], which the Aeginetes had carried off from [[Epidaurus|Epidauros]], their parent state.\n\nThe Epidaurians had been accustomed to make annual offerings to the Athenian deities [[Athena]] and [[Erechtheus]] in payment for the Athenian olive-wood of which the statues were made. Upon the refusal of the Aeginetes to continue these offerings, the [[Athenians]] endeavoured to carry away the images. Their design was frustrated miraculously \u2013 according to the Aeginetan version, the statues fell upon their knees \u2013 and only a single survivor returned to Athens. There he became victim to the fury of his comrades' widows who pierced him with their brooch-pins. No date is assigned by Herodotus for this \"old feud\"; recent writers, such as [[J. B. Bury]] and R. W. Macan, suggest the period between Solon and Peisistratus, {{circa|570 BC}}. It is possible that the whole episode is mythical. A critical analysis of the narrative seems to reveal little else than a series of aetiological traditions (explanatory of cults and customs), such as of the kneeling posture of the images of Damia and Auxesia, of the use of native ware instead of Athenian in their worship, and of the change in women's dress at Athens from the Dorian to the [[Ionia]]n style.\n\n[[File:Blouet Tr\u00e9zel Egine.JPG|thumb|Colour depiction of the [[Temple of Aphaea]], sacred to a mother goddess, particularly worshiped on Aegina.]]\n[[File:Temple of Aphaia in February 2005 14.jpg|thumb|The Temple of Aphaea.]]\n\nThe account which Herodotus gives of the hostilities between the two states during the early years of the 5th century BC is to the following effect. The [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebans]], after the defeat by Athens about 507&nbsp;BC, appealed to Aegina for assistance. The Aeginetans at first contented themselves with sending the images of the [[Aeacidae]], the [[tutelary deity|tutelary heroes]] of their island. Subsequently, however, they contracted an alliance, and ravaged the seaboard of Attica. The Athenians were preparing to make reprisals, in spite of the advice of the [[Delphic oracle]] that they should desist from attacking Aegina for thirty years, and content themselves meanwhile with dedicating a precinct to [[Aeacus]], when their projects were interrupted by the [[Sparta]]n intrigues for the restoration of [[Hippias]].\n\nIn 491&nbsp;BC Aegina was one of the states which gave the symbols of submission (\"earth and water\") to [[Achaemenid Persia]]. Athens at once appealed to Sparta to punish this act of [[medism]], and [[Cleomenes I]], one of the Spartan kings, crossed over to the island, to arrest those who were responsible for it. His attempt was at first unsuccessful; but, after the deposition of [[Demaratus]], he visited the island a second time, accompanied by his new colleague [[Leotychides]], seized ten of the leading citizens and deposited them at Athens as hostages.\n\nAfter the death of Cleomenes and the refusal of the Athenians to restore the hostages to Leotychides, the Aeginetes retaliated by seizing a number of Athenians at a festival at [[Sunium]]. Thereupon the Athenians concerted a plot with [[Nicodromus]], the leader of the democratic party in the island, for the betrayal of Aegina. He was to seize the old city, and they were to come to his aid on the same day with seventy vessels. The plot failed owing to the late arrival of the Athenian force, when Nicodromus had already fled the island. An engagement followed in which the Aeginetes were defeated. Subsequently, however, they succeeded in winning a victory over the Athenian fleet.\n\nAll the incidents subsequent to the appeal of Athens to Sparta are referred expressly by Herodotus to the interval between the sending of the heralds in 491&nbsp;BC and the invasion of [[Datis]] and [[Artaphernes]] in 490&nbsp;BC (cf. Herod. vi. 49 with 94).\n\nThere are difficulties with this story, of which the following are the principal elements:\n* Herodotus nowhere states or implies that peace was concluded between the two states before 481&nbsp;BC, nor does he distinguish between different wars during this period. Hence it would follow that the war lasted from soon after 507&nbsp;BC until the congress at the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] in 481&nbsp;BC\n* It is only for two years (491 and 490&nbsp;BC) out of the twenty-five that any details are given. It is the more remarkable that no incidents are recorded in the period between the battles of [[battle of Marathon|Marathon]] and [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]], since at the time of the Isthmian Congress the war was described as the most important one then being waged in Greece,<ref>Herod. vii. 145</ref>\n* It is improbable that Athens would have sent twenty vessels to the aid of the Ionians in 499&nbsp;BC if at the time it was at war with Aegina.\n* There is an incidental indication of time, which indicates the period after Marathon as the true date for the events which are referred by Herodotus to the year before Marathon, viz. the thirty years that were to elapse between the dedication of the precinct to Aeacus and the final victory of Athens.<ref>Herod. v. 89</ref>\n[[File:Temple of Apollo Aegina Greece.jpg|thumb|The ruins of the Temple of Apollo.]]\n\nAs the final victory of Athens over Aegina was in 458&nbsp;BC, the thirty years of the oracle would carry us back to the year 488&nbsp;BC as the date of the dedication of the precinct and the beginning of hostilities. This inference is supported by the date of the building of the 200 triremes \"for the war against Aegina\" on the advice of [[Themistocles]], which is given in the ''Constitution of Athens'' as 483\u2013482&nbsp;BC.<ref>Herod. vii. 144; [[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Ath. Pol.]] r2. 7</ref> It is probable, therefore, that Herodotus is in error both in tracing back the beginning of hostilities to an alliance between Thebes and Aegina ({{circa|507 BC}}) and in claiming the episode of Nicodromus occurred prior to the battle of Marathon.\n\nOvertures were unquestionably made by Thebes for an alliance with Aegina {{circa|507 BC}}, but they came to nothing. The refusal of Aegina was in the diplomatic guise of \"sending the Aeacidae.\" The real occasion of the beginning of the war was the refusal of Athens to restore the hostages some twenty years later. There was but one war, and it lasted from 488 to 481&nbsp;BC. That Athens had the worst of it in this war is certain. Herodotus had no Athenian victories to record after the initial success, and the fact that Themistocles was able to carry his proposal to devote the surplus funds of the state to the building of so large a fleet seems to imply that the Athenians were themselves convinced that a supreme effort was necessary.\n\nIt may be noted, in confirmation of this opinion, that the naval supremacy of Aegina is assigned by the ancient writers on chronology to precisely this period, i.e. the years 490\u2013480&nbsp;BC.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/><ref>[[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], ''Houston Chronicle''. Can. p.&nbsp;337</ref>\n\n===Decline===\nIn the repulse of [[Xerxes I]] it is possible that the Aeginetes played a larger part than is conceded to them by Herodotus. The Athenian tradition, which he follows in the main, would naturally seek to obscure their services. It was to Aegina rather than Athens that the prize of valour at Salamis was awarded, and the destruction of the Persian fleet appears to have been as much the work of the Aeginetan contingent as of the Athenian (Herod. viii. 91). There are other indications, too, of the importance of the Aeginetan fleet in the Greek scheme of defence. In view of these considerations it becomes difficult to credit the number of the vessels that is assigned to them by Herodotus (30 as against 180 Athenian vessels, cf. [[Greek History]], sect. Authorities). During the next twenty years the Philo-Laconian policy of [[Cimon]] secured Aegina, as a member of the Spartan league, from attack. The change in Athenian foreign policy, which was consequent upon the ostracism of Cimon in 461&nbsp;BC, resulted in what is sometimes called the First Peloponnesian War, during which most of the fighting was experienced by Corinth and Aegina. The latter state was forced to surrender to Athens after a siege, and to accept the position of a subject-ally ({{circa|456 BC}}). The tribute was fixed at 30 talents.\n\nBy the terms of the [[Thirty Years' Peace]] (445&nbsp;BC) Athens promised to restore to Aegina her autonomy, but the clause remained ineffective. During the first winter of the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431&nbsp;BC) Athens expelled the Aeginetans and established a [[cleruchy]] in their island. The exiles were settled by Sparta in [[Thyreatis]], on the frontiers of Laconia and Argolis. Even in their new home they were not safe from Athenian rancour. A force commanded by [[Nicias]] landed in 424&nbsp;BC, and killed most of them. At the end of the Peloponnesian War [[Lysander]] restored the scattered remnants of the old inhabitants to the island, <ref name=Xenophon229>Xenophon. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0206%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D2%3Asection%3D9 ''Hellenica'', 2.2.9]: \"Meantime Lysander, upon reaching Aegina, restored the state to the Aeginetans, gathering together as many of them as he could, and he did the same thing for the Melians also and for all the others who had been deprived of their native states.\"</ref><ref name=Plutarch144>Plutarch. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0048%3Achapter%3D14%3Asection%3D3 ''Life of Lysander'', 14.3]: \"But there were other measures of Lysander upon which all the Greeks looked with pleasure, when, for instance, the Aeginetans, after a long time, received back their own city, and when the Melians and Scionaeans were restored to their homes by him, after the Athenians had been driven out and had delivered back the cities.\"</ref> which was used by the Spartans as a base for operations against Athens during the [[Corinthian War]]. Its greatness, however, was at an end. The part which it plays henceforward is insignificant.\n\nIt would be a mistake to attribute the demise of Aegina solely to the development of the [[Athenian navy]]. It is probable that the power of Aegina had steadily declined during the twenty years after Salamis, and that it had declined absolutely, as well as relatively to that of Athens. Commerce was the source of Aegina's greatness, and her trade, which seems to have been principally with the Levant, must have suffered seriously from the war with Persia. Aegina's medism in 491 is to be explained by its commercial relations with the Persian Empire. It was forced into patriotism in spite of itself, and the glory won by the [[battle of Salamis]] was paid for by the loss of its trade and the decay of its marine. The completeness of the ruin of so powerful a state is explained by the economic conditions of the island, the prosperity of which was based on slave labour. It is impossible, indeed, to accept Aristotle's (cf. Athenaeus vi. 272) estimate of 470,000 as the number of the slave population; it is clear, however, that the number must have been much greater than that of the free inhabitants. In this respect the history of Aegina does but anticipate the history of Greece as a whole.\n\nThe constitutional history of Aegina is unusually simple. So long as the island retained its independence the government was an [[oligarchy]]. There is no trace of heroic monarchy and no tradition of a ''[[tyranny|tyrannis]]''. The story of Nicodromus, while it proves the existence of a democratic party, suggests, at the same time, that it could count upon little support.\n\n===Hellenistic period and Roman rule===\nAegina with the rest of Greece became dominated successively by the [[Macedon]]ians (322\u2013229 BC), the [[Achaean League|Achaeans]] (229\u2013211&nbsp;BC), [[Aetolian League|Aetolians]] (211\u2013210&nbsp; BC), [[Attalus I|Attalus of Pergamum]] (210\u2013133&nbsp;BC) and the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] (after 133&nbsp;BC).<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> A sign at the Archaeological Museum of Aegina is reported to say that a [[Jew]]ish community is believed to have been established in Aegina \"at the end of the second and during the 3rd century AD\" by Jews fleeing the [[barbarian invasions]] of the time in Greece.<ref>{{Cite sign|title=Mosaic floor of a Jewish synagogue|medium=Sign |publisher=[[Archaeological Museum of Aegina]]|location=Aegina, Greece}}</ref> However, the first phases of those invasions began in the 4th century.

The island must then have been fruitful, for one of the conditions by which Venice accorded him protection was that he should supply grain to Venetian colonies. He agreed to surrender the island to Venice if his family became extinct. [[Antonio II Acciaioli]] opposed the treaty for one of his adopted daughters had married the future lord of Aegina, Antonello Caopena.\n\n===Venetians in Aegina (1451\u20131537)===\n[[File:Markellos tower Aegina Greece.jpg|thumb|The Venetian era Markellos tower]]\n\nIn 1451, Aegina became Venetian. The islanders welcomed Venetian rule; the claims of Antonello's uncle Arn\u00e0, who had lands in [[Argolis]], were satisfied by a pension. A Venetian governor (''rettore'') was appointed, who was dependent on the authorities of Nauplia. After Arn\u00e0's death, his son Alioto renewed his claim to the island but was told that the republic was resolved to keep it. He and his family were pensioned and one of them aided in the defence of Aegina against the Turks in 1537, was captured with his family, and died in a Turkish dungeon.\n\nIn 1463 the [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1463\u20131479)|Turco-Venetian war]] began, which was destined to cost the Venetians [[Euboea|Negroponte]] (Euboea), the island of Lemnos, most of the [[Cyclades]] islands, [[Shkodra|Scudra]] and their colonies in the [[Morea]]. Peace was concluded in 1479. Venice still retained Aegina, [[Naupactus|Lepanto]] (Naupactus), [[Nauplio|Nauplia]], [[Monemvasia]], [[Methoni, Messenia|Modon]], [[Pylos|Navarino]], [[Koroni|Coron]], and the islands [[Crete]], [[Mykonos]] and [[Tinos]]. Aegina remained subject to Nauplia.\n\n====Administration====\nAegina obtained money for its defences by reluctantly sacrificing its cherished relic, the head of St. George, which had been carried there from Livadia by the Catalans. In 1462, the Venetian Senate ordered the relic to be removed to St. Giorgio Maggiore in Venice and on 12 November, it was transported from Aegina by Vettore Cappello, the famous Venetian commander. In return, the Senate gave the Aeginetes 100 [[ducat]]s apiece towards fortifying the island.\n\nIn 1519, the government was reformed. The system of having two rectors was found to result in frequent quarrels and the republic thenceforth sent out a single official styled Bailie and Captain, assisted by two [[councillor]]s, who performed the duties of [[camerlengo]] by turns. The Bailie's authority extended over the rector of Aegina, whereas [[Kastri, Cythera|Kastri]] (opposite the island [[Hydra (island)|Hydra]]) was granted to two families, the [[Palaiologoi]] and the [[Alberti (surname)|Alberti]].\n\nSociety at Nauplia was divided into three classes: nobles, citizens and plebeians, and it was customary for nobles alone to possess the much-coveted local offices, such as the judge of the inferior court and inspector of weights and measures. The populace now demanded its share and the home government ordered that at least one of the three inspectors should be a non-noble.\n\nAegina had always been exposed to the raids of [[Privateer|corsairs]] and had oppressive governors during these last 30&nbsp;years of Venetian rule. Venetian nobles were not willing to go to this island. In 1533, three rectors of Aegina were punished for their acts of injustice and there is a graphic account of the reception given by the Aeginetans to the captain of Nauplia, who came to command an enquiry into the administration of these delinquents (vid. inscription over the entrance of St. George the Catholic in Paliachora). The rectors had spurned their ancient right to elect an islander to keep one key of the money-chest. They had also threatened to leave the island en masse with the commissioner, unless the captain avenged their wrongs. To spare the economy of the community, it was ordered that appeals from the governor's decision should be made on Crete, instead of in Venice. The republic was to pay a [[bakshish]] to the Turkish governor of the Morea and to the [[voivode]] who was stationed at the frontier of Thermisi (opposite Hydra). The fortifications too, were allowed to become decrepit and were inadequately guarded.\n\n====16th century====\n[[File:Aegina - view 05.jpg|thumb|The ruins of Palaiochora. Walls, houses, and castle have been destroyed, only the chapels were restored.]]\nAfter the end of the Duchy of Athens and the [[principality of Achaia]], the only Latin possessions left on the mainland of Greece were the papal city of Monemvasia, the fortress of [[Vonitsa]], the Messenian stations Coron and Modon, Lepanto, Pteleon, Navarino, and the castles of Argos and Nauplia, to which the island of Aegina was subordinate.\n\nIn 1502\u201303, the new peace treaty left Venice with nothing but Cephalonia, Monemvasia and Nauplia, with their appurtenances in the Morea. And against the sack of Megara, it had to endure the temporary capture of the castle of Aegina by [[Kemal Reis]] and the abduction of 2000 inhabitants. This treaty was renewed in 1513 and 1521. All supplies of grain from Nauplia and Monemvasia had to be imported from Turkish possessions, while corsairs rendered dangerous all traffic by sea.\n\nIn 1537, sultan [[Suleyman the Magnificent|Suleiman]] declared war upon Venice and his admiral [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] devastated much of the [[Ionian Islands]], and in October invaded the island of Aegina. On the fourth day Palaiochora was captured, but the Latin church of St George was spared. Hayreddin Barbarossa had the adult male population massacred and took away 6,000 surviving women and children as slaves. Then Barbarossa sailed to Naxos, whence he carried off an immense booty, compelling the Duke of Naxos to purchase his further independence by paying a tribute of 5000 ducats.\n\nWith the peace of 1540, Venice ceded Nauplia and Monemvasia. For nearly 150&nbsp;years afterwards, Venice ruled no part of the mainland of Greece except Parga and Butrinto (subordinate politically to the Ionian Islands), but it still retained its insular dominions [[Cyprus]], Crete, [[Tenos]] and six Ionian islands.\n\n===First Ottoman period (1540\u20131687)===\nThe island was attacked and left desolate by [[Francesco Morosini]] during the [[Cretan War (1645\u20131669)|Cretan War]] (1654).\n\n===Second Venetian period (1687\u20131715)===\n[[File:Rottmann - Landschaft auf der Insel Aegina - 1845.jpeg|thumb|300px|Aegina in 1845, by [[Carl Rottmann]].]]\n\nIn 1684, the beginning of the [[Morean War]] between Venice and the [[Ottoman Empire]] resulted in the temporary reconquest of a large part of the country by the Republic. In 1687 the Venetian army arrived in Piraeus and captured Attica. The number of the Athenians at that time exceeded 6,000, the Albanians from the villages of Attica excluded, whilst in 1674 the population of Aegina did not seem to exceed 3,000 inhabitants, two thirds of which were women. The Aeginetans had been reduced to poverty to pay their taxes. The most significant plague epidemic began in Attica during 1688, an occasion that caused the massive migration of Athenians toward the south; most of them settled in Aegina. In 1693 Morosini resumed command, but his only acts were to refortify the castle of Aegina, which he had demolished during the Cretan war in 1655, the cost of upkeep being paid as long as the war lasted by the Athenians, and to place it and Salamis under Malipiero as Governor. This caused the Athenians to send him a request for the renewal of Venetian protection and an offer of an annual tribute. He died in 1694 and Zeno was appointed at his place.\n\nIn 1699, thanks to English mediation, the war ended with the [[peace of Karlowitz]] by which Venice retained possession of the 7 Ionian islands as well as Butrinto and [[Parga]], the Morea, [[Spinalonga]] and [[Suda]], Tenos, [[Santa Maura]] and Aegina and ceased to pay a tribute for [[Zante]], but which restored Lepanto to the [[Ottoman sultan]]. [[Cerigo]] and Aegina were united administratively since the peace with Morea, which not only paid all the expenses of administration but furnished a substantial balance for the naval defence of Venice, in which it was directly interested.\n\n===Second Ottoman period (1715\u20131821)===\nDuring the early part of the [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1714\u20131718)|Ottoman\u2013Venetian War of 1714\u20131718]] the Ottoman Fleet commanded by Canum Hoca captured Aegina. Ottomans rule in Aegina and the Morea was resumed and confirmed by the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]], and they retained control of the island with the exception of a brief Russian occupation [[Orlov Revolt]] (early 1770s), until the beginning of the [[Greek War of Independence]] in 1821.\n\n===Greek Revolution===\nDuring the Greek War of Independence, Aegina became an administrative centre for the Greek revolutionary authorities. [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]] was briefly established here.\n\n==Landmarks==\n[[File:Aegina port.jpg|thumb|centre|600px|Panorama of Aegina's port.]]\n[[File:Aegina harbour 1.jpg|thumb|View of the port.]]\n[[File:Agios-nectarios-aegina.jpg|thumb|The cathedral of [[Nectarios of Aegina|Saint Nectarios of Aegina]].]]\n[[File:\u0395\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03bc\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u0391\u03af\u03b3\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1.jpg|thumb|Traditional street in the town]]\n[[File:Aigina.JPG|thumb|Aegina town centre.]]\n[[File:Ioannis Capodistrias bust Karakatsanis 1887 Aegina Greece.jpg|thumb|140px|A bust of Kapodistrias]]\n\n* '''[[Temple of Aphaea]]''', dedicated to its namesake, a goddess who was later associated with [[Athena]]; the temple was part of a pre-Christian, equilateral holy triangle of temples including the Athenian [[Parthenon]] and the temple of [[Poseidon]] at [[Sounion]].\n* '''Monastery of Agios Nectarios''', dedicated to [[Nectarios of Aegina]], a recent saint of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]].\n* '''[[Ioannis Kapodistrias]]''' (1776\u20131831), the first administrator of free modern Greece, had a large building constructed; intended as a barracks, it was used subsequently as a museum, a library and a school. The museum was the first institution of its kind in Greece, but the collection was transferred to [[Athens]] in 1834. A statue in the principal square commemorates him.\n* '''Temple of Zeus Hellanios''', near the village of Pachia Rachi, is a 13th-century Byzantine church, built on the ruins of the ancient temple to Zeus Hellanios, built in the 4th century BC.  The staircase leading up to the church, some of the original walls, and loose stones from the earlier temple remain.\n\n==Economy==\n===Pistachios===\nIn 1896, the physician Nikolaos Peroglou introduced the systematic cultivation of pistachios, which soon became popular among the inhabitants of the island. By 1950, pistachio cultivation had significantly displaced the rest of the agricultural activity due to its high profitability but also due to the [[phylloxera]] that threatened the [[vineyards]] that time. As a result, in the early 60s, the first pistachio peeling factory was established in the Plakakia area by Grigorios Konidaris. The quality of \"''Fistiki Aeginis''\" (Aegina Pistachios), a name that was established as a product of [[Protected Designation of Origin]] (PDO) in 1996, is considered internationally excellent and superior to several foreign varieties, due to the special climatic conditions of the island (drought) as well as soil's volcanic characteristics. Pistachios have made Aegina famous all over the world. Today, half of the pistachio growers are members of the Agricultural Cooperative of Aegina's Pistachio Producers. It is estimated that pistachio cultivation covers 29,000 acres of the island while the total production reaches 2,700 tons per year. In recent years, in mid-September, the Pistachio Festival has been organized every year under the name \"''Fistiki Fest''\".<ref>source: [https://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%91%CE%AF%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%BD%CE%B1#%CE%A6%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%84%CE%AF%CE%BA%CE%B9_%CE%91%CE%B9%CE%B3%CE%AF%CE%BD%CE%B7%CF%82 greek wikipedia]</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Mythology===\nIn [[Greek mythology]], '''[[Aegina (mythology)|Aegina]]''' was a daughter of the river god [[Asopus]] and the [[nymph]] [[Metope (mythology)|Metope]]. She bore at least two children: [[Menoetius (mythology)|Menoetius]] by [[Actor (mythology)|Actor]], and [[Aeacus]] by the god [[Zeus]]. When Zeus abducted Aegina, he took her to [[Oenone]], an island close to [[Attica]]. Here, Aegina gave birth to Aeacus, who would later become king of Oenone; thenceforth, the island's name was Aegina.\n\nAegina was the gathering place of Myrmidons; in Aegina they gathered and trained. Zeus needed an elite army and at first thought that Aegina, which at the time did not have any villagers, was a good place. So he changed some ants ({{lang-grc|\u039c\u03c5\u03c1\u03bc\u03cd\u03b3\u03b9\u03b1}}, Myrmigia) into warriors who had six hands and wore black armour. Later, the [[Myrmidons]], commanded by [[Achilles]], were known as the most fearsome fighting unit in [[Greece]].\n\n===Famous Aeginetans===\n* [[Aeacus]], the first king of Aegina according to mythology, in whose honour the [[Aeacea]] were celebrated\n* [[Smilis]] (6th century BC), sculptor\n* [[Onatas]] (5th century BC), sculptor\n* [[Ptolichus]] (5th century BC), sculptor\n* [[Philiscus of Aegina]] (4th century BC), Cynic philosopher\n* [[Paul of Aegina]] (7th century), medical scholar and physician\n* [[Athanasia of Aegina|Saint Athanasia of Aegina]] (9th century), abbess and saint\n* [[Cosmas II Atticus]] (12th century), Patriarch of Constantinople\n* [[Nectarios of Aegina]] (1846\u20131920), bishop and saint\n* [[Aristeidis Moraitinis (aviator)]] born 1891, died 1918\n\n*The influential Leoussi family originated on the isle of Aegina; their ancestry can be traced as far back as the 15th century.{{cn|date=June 2018}}\n*[[Gustav Hasford]], American military journalist and novelist, moved to Aegina and died there of heart failure on 29 January 1993, aged 45<ref>{{cite web|website=Findagrave|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/34923728|title=Jerry Gustav \"Gus\" Hasford|}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/thesesdissertations/236/|author=Ross, Matthew Samuel|title=An Examination of the life and work of Gustav Hasford, Paper 236|date=2010|website=UNLV Theses, Dissertations, Professional Papers, and Capstones}}</ref><ref>Lewis, Grover (June 4\u201310, 1993). \"The Killing of Gus Hasford\".

It is part of the [[Islands (regional unit)|Islands regional unit]], [[Attica (region)|Attica]] region. The municipality is subdivided into the following five communities (population in 2011 in parentheses ):<ref name=Kallikratis>[http://www.kedke.gr/uploads2010/FEKB129211082010_kallikr{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n* Kypseli (2124)\n* Mesagros (1361)\n* Perdika (823)\n* Vathy (1495)\n\nThe capital is the town of Aegina, situated at the northwestern end of the island.

The northern and western sides consist of stony but fertile [[plain]]s, which are well cultivated and produce luxuriant crops of grain, with some cotton, [[vine]]s, [[almond]]s, [[olive]]s and [[ficus|figs]],<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> but the most characteristic crop of Aegina today (2000s) is [[pistachio]]. Economically, the [[Sea sponge|sponge]] fisheries are of notable importance. The southern volcanic part of the island is rugged and mountainous, and largely barren. Its highest rise is the conical [[Mount Oros]] (531 m) in the south, and the Panhellenian ridge stretches northward with narrow fertile valleys on either side.\n\nThe beaches are also a popular tourist attraction. [[Hydrofoil]] ferries from [[Piraeus]] take only forty minutes to reach Aegina; the regular ferry takes about an hour, with ticket prices for adults within the 4\u201315 [[euro]] range. There are regular bus services from Aegina town to destinations throughout the [[List of islands of Greece|island]] such as [[Agia Marina, Aegina|Agia Marina]]. [[Portes, Aigina|Portes]] is a fishing village on the east coast.\n{{Wide image|Aegina_island_panorama.jpg|1000px|A panorama of the island of Aegina, from the Mediterranean sea.\n|alt=A panorama of the island of Aegina, from the Mediterranean sea\n}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Earliest history (20th\u20137th centuries BC)===\nAegina, according to [[Herodotus]],<ref>Herodotus v. 83, viii.46; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 2.29.9</ref> was a colony of [[Epidaurus]], to which state it was originally subject.

J. Evans, in ''Journal of Hellenic Studies'', vol. xiii. p. 195  {{When|date=February 2011}}</ref> It is probable that the island was not doricised before the 9th century BC.\n\nOne of the earliest historical facts is its membership in the [[Amphictyony of Calauria|Amphictyony]] or [[League of Calauria]], attested around the 8th century BC. This ostensibly religious league included\u2014besides Aegina\u2014[[Athens]], the [[Minyans|Minyan]] (Boeotian) [[Orchomenus (Boeotia)|Orchomenos]], [[Troezen]], [[Ermioni|Hermione]], [[Nauplia]], and [[Prasiae]]. It was probably an organisation of city-states that were still Mycenaean, for the purpose of suppressing [[piracy]] in the Aegean that began as a result of the decay of the naval supremacy of the Mycenaean princes.\n\nAegina seems to have belonged to the [[Eretrian]] league during the [[Lelantine War]]; this, perhaps, may explain the war with [[Samos]], a major member of the rival Chalcidian league during the reign of King [[Amphicrates]] (Herod. iii. 59), i.e. not later than the earlier half of the 7th century BC.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n===Coinage and sea power (7th\u20135th centuries BC)===\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align     = right\n | width = 250\n | header = Coins of Aegina\n | footer =\n | image1 = Aegina Stater achaic.jpg\n | alt1 =\n | caption1 = Silver [[stater]] of Aegina, 550\u2013530&nbsp;BC.

It is usually stated on the authority of [[Ephorus]], that [[Pheidon]] of Argos established a mint in Aegina, the first city-state to issue coins in Europe, the Aeginetic [[stater]]. One stamped stater (having the mark of some authority in the form of a picture or words) can be seen in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale]] of Paris. It is an [[electrum]] stater of a turtle, an animal sacred to Aphrodite, struck at Aegina that dates from 700&nbsp;BC.<ref>British Museum Catalogue 11 \u2013 [https://docs.google.com/file/d/0ByKcmdYWS2bZWVpFLWRtVXd0Ulk/edit?pli=1 Attica Megaris Aegina], 700 \u2013 550 BC, plate [http://www.snible.org/coins/bmc/attica/XXIII.jpg XXIII].</ref> Therefore, it is thought that the Aeginetes, within 30 or 40&nbsp;years of the invention of coinage in [[Asia Minor]] by the [[Ionia]]n Greeks or the [[Lydians]] (c. 630 BC), might have been the ones to introduce coinage to the Western world. The fact that the Aeginetic standard of weights and measures (developed during the mid-7th century) was one of the two standards in general use in the Greek world (the other being the Euboic-Attic) is sufficient evidence of the early commercial importance of the island.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> The Aeginetic weight standard of about 12.3 grams was widely adopted in the Greek world during the 7th century BC. The Aeginetic stater was divided into three drachmae of 4.1 grams of silver. Staters depicting a sea-turtle were struck up to the end of the 5th century BC. Following the end of the [[Peloponnesian War]], 404&nbsp;BC, it was replaced by the land [[tortoise]].\n\nDuring the naval expansion of Aegina during the [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic Period]], Kydonia was an ideal maritime stop for Aegina's fleet on its way to other [[Mediterranean]] ports controlled by the emerging sea-power Aegina.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/10881/cydonia.html|title=The Modern Antiquarian: Cydonia|website=www.themodernantiquarian.com}}</ref> During the next century Aegina was one of the three principal states trading at the [[Marketplace|emporium]] of [[Naucratis]] in Egypt, and it was the only Greek state near Europe that had a share in this factory.<ref>Herodotus ii. 178</ref> At the beginning of the 5th century BC it seems to have been an entrep\u00f4t of the [[Black Sea|Pontic]] grain trade, which, at a later date, became an Athenian monopoly.<ref>Herodotus vii. 147</ref>\n\nUnlike the other commercial states of the 7th and 6th centuries BC, such as [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], [[Chalcis]], [[Eretria]] and [[Miletus]], Aegina did not found any colonies. The settlements to which Strabo refers (viii. 376) cannot be regarded as any real exceptions to this statement.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n===Rivalry with Athens (5th century BC)===\nThe known history of Aegina is almost exclusively a history of its relations with the neighbouring state of Athens, which began to compete with the [[thalassocracy]] (sea power) of Aegina about the beginning of the 6th century BC. [[Solon]] passed laws limiting Aeginetan commerce in Attica. The legendary history of these relations, as recorded by Herodotus (v. 79\u201389; vi. 49\u201351, 73, 85\u201394), involves critical problems of some difficulty and interest. He traces the hostility of the two states back to a dispute about the images of the goddesses [[Damia (goddess)|Damia]] and [[Auxesia]], which the Aeginetes had carried off from [[Epidaurus|Epidauros]], their parent state.\n\nThe Epidaurians had been accustomed to make annual offerings to the Athenian deities [[Athena]] and [[Erechtheus]] in payment for the Athenian olive-wood of which the statues were made. Upon the refusal of the Aeginetes to continue these offerings, the [[Athenians]] endeavoured to carry away the images. Their design was frustrated miraculously \u2013 according to the Aeginetan version, the statues fell upon their knees \u2013 and only a single survivor returned to Athens. There he became victim to the fury of his comrades' widows who pierced him with their brooch-pins. No date is assigned by Herodotus for this \"old feud\"; recent writers, such as [[J. B. Bury]] and R. W. Macan, suggest the period between Solon and Peisistratus, {{circa|570 BC}}. It is possible that the whole episode is mythical. A critical analysis of the narrative seems to reveal little else than a series of aetiological traditions (explanatory of cults and customs), such as of the kneeling posture of the images of Damia and Auxesia, of the use of native ware instead of Athenian in their worship, and of the change in women's dress at Athens from the Dorian to the [[Ionia]]n style.\n\n[[File:Blouet Tr\u00e9zel Egine.JPG|thumb|Colour depiction of the [[Temple of Aphaea]], sacred to a mother goddess, particularly worshiped on Aegina.]]\n[[File:Temple of Aphaia in February 2005 14.jpg|thumb|The Temple of Aphaea.]]\n\nThe account which Herodotus gives of the hostilities between the two states during the early years of the 5th century BC is to the following effect. The [[Ancient Thebes (Boeotia)|Thebans]], after the defeat by Athens about 507&nbsp;BC, appealed to Aegina for assistance. The Aeginetans at first contented themselves with sending the images of the [[Aeacidae]], the [[tutelary deity|tutelary heroes]] of their island. Subsequently, however, they contracted an alliance, and ravaged the seaboard of Attica. The Athenians were preparing to make reprisals, in spite of the advice of the [[Delphic oracle]] that they should desist from attacking Aegina for thirty years, and content themselves meanwhile with dedicating a precinct to [[Aeacus]], when their projects were interrupted by the [[Sparta]]n intrigues for the restoration of [[Hippias]].\n\nIn 491&nbsp;BC Aegina was one of the states which gave the symbols of submission (\"earth and water\") to [[Achaemenid Persia]]. Athens at once appealed to Sparta to punish this act of [[medism]], and [[Cleomenes I]], one of the Spartan kings, crossed over to the island, to arrest those who were responsible for it. His attempt was at first unsuccessful; but, after the deposition of [[Demaratus]], he visited the island a second time, accompanied by his new colleague [[Leotychides]], seized ten of the leading citizens and deposited them at Athens as hostages.\n\nAfter the death of Cleomenes and the refusal of the Athenians to restore the hostages to Leotychides, the Aeginetes retaliated by seizing a number of Athenians at a festival at [[Sunium]]. Thereupon the Athenians concerted a plot with [[Nicodromus]], the leader of the democratic party in the island, for the betrayal of Aegina. He was to seize the old city, and they were to come to his aid on the same day with seventy vessels. The plot failed owing to the late arrival of the Athenian force, when Nicodromus had already fled the island. An engagement followed in which the Aeginetes were defeated. Subsequently, however, they succeeded in winning a victory over the Athenian fleet.\n\nAll the incidents subsequent to the appeal of Athens to Sparta are referred expressly by Herodotus to the interval between the sending of the heralds in 491&nbsp;BC and the invasion of [[Datis]] and [[Artaphernes]] in 490&nbsp;BC (cf. Herod. vi. 49 with 94).\n\nThere are difficulties with this story, of which the following are the principal elements:\n* Herodotus nowhere states or implies that peace was concluded between the two states before 481&nbsp;BC, nor does he distinguish between different wars during this period. Hence it would follow that the war lasted from soon after 507&nbsp;BC until the congress at the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] in 481&nbsp;BC\n* It is only for two years (491 and 490&nbsp;BC) out of the twenty-five that any details are given. It is the more remarkable that no incidents are recorded in the period between the battles of [[battle of Marathon|Marathon]] and [[Battle of Salamis|Salamis]], since at the time of the Isthmian Congress the war was described as the most important one then being waged in Greece,<ref>Herod. vii. 145</ref>\n* It is improbable that Athens would have sent twenty vessels to the aid of the Ionians in 499&nbsp;BC if at the time it was at war with Aegina.\n* There is an incidental indication of time, which indicates the period after Marathon as the true date for the events which are referred by Herodotus to the year before Marathon, viz. the thirty years that were to elapse between the dedication of the precinct to Aeacus and the final victory of Athens.<ref>Herod. v. 89</ref>\n[[File:Temple of Apollo Aegina Greece.jpg|thumb|The ruins of the Temple of Apollo.]]\n\nAs the final victory of Athens over Aegina was in 458&nbsp;BC, the thirty years of the oracle would carry us back to the year 488&nbsp;BC as the date of the dedication of the precinct and the beginning of hostilities. This inference is supported by the date of the building of the 200 triremes \"for the war against Aegina\" on the advice of [[Themistocles]], which is given in the ''Constitution of Athens'' as 483\u2013482&nbsp;BC.<ref>Herod. vii. 144; [[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Ath. Pol.]] r2. 7</ref> It is probable, therefore, that Herodotus is in error both in tracing back the beginning of hostilities to an alliance between Thebes and Aegina ({{circa|507 BC}}) and in claiming the episode of Nicodromus occurred prior to the battle of Marathon.\n\nOvertures were unquestionably made by Thebes for an alliance with Aegina {{circa|507 BC}}, but they came to nothing. The refusal of Aegina was in the diplomatic guise of \"sending the Aeacidae.\" The real occasion of the beginning of the war was the refusal of Athens to restore the hostages some twenty years later. There was but one war, and it lasted from 488 to 481&nbsp;BC. That Athens had the worst of it in this war is certain. Herodotus had no Athenian victories to record after the initial success, and the fact that Themistocles was able to carry his proposal to devote the surplus funds of the state to the building of so large a fleet seems to imply that the Athenians were themselves convinced that a supreme effort was necessary.\n\nIt may be noted, in confirmation of this opinion, that the naval supremacy of Aegina is assigned by the ancient writers on chronology to precisely this period, i.e. the years 490\u2013480&nbsp;BC.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/><ref>[[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], ''Houston Chronicle''. Can. p.&nbsp;337</ref>\n\n===Decline===\nIn the repulse of [[Xerxes I]] it is possible that the Aeginetes played a larger part than is conceded to them by Herodotus. The Athenian tradition, which he follows in the main, would naturally seek to obscure their services. It was to Aegina rather than Athens that the prize of valour at Salamis was awarded, and the destruction of the Persian fleet appears to have been as much the work of the Aeginetan contingent as of the Athenian (Herod. viii. 91). There are other indications, too, of the importance of the Aeginetan fleet in the Greek scheme of defence. In view of these considerations it becomes difficult to credit the number of the vessels that is assigned to them by Herodotus (30 as against 180 Athenian vessels, cf. [[Greek History]], sect. Authorities). During the next twenty years the Philo-Laconian policy of [[Cimon]] secured Aegina, as a member of the Spartan league, from attack. The change in Athenian foreign policy, which was consequent upon the ostracism of Cimon in 461&nbsp;BC, resulted in what is sometimes called the First Peloponnesian War, during which most of the fighting was experienced by Corinth and Aegina. The latter state was forced to surrender to Athens after a siege, and to accept the position of a subject-ally ({{circa|456 BC}}). The tribute was fixed at 30 talents.\n\nBy the terms of the [[Thirty Years' Peace]] (445&nbsp;BC) Athens promised to restore to Aegina her autonomy, but the clause remained ineffective. During the first winter of the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431&nbsp;BC) Athens expelled the Aeginetans and established a [[cleruchy]] in their island. The exiles were settled by Sparta in [[Thyreatis]], on the frontiers of Laconia and Argolis. Even in their new home they were not safe from Athenian rancour. A force commanded by [[Nicias]] landed in 424&nbsp;BC, and killed most of them. At the end of the Peloponnesian War [[Lysander]] restored the scattered remnants of the old inhabitants to the island, <ref name=Xenophon229>Xenophon. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0206%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D2%3Asection%3D9 ''Hellenica'', 2.2.9]: \"Meantime Lysander, upon reaching Aegina, restored the state to the Aeginetans, gathering together as many of them as he could, and he did the same thing for the Melians also and for all the others who had been deprived of their native states.\"</ref><ref name=Plutarch144>Plutarch.

Its greatness, however, was at an end. The part which it plays henceforward is insignificant.\n\nIt would be a mistake to attribute the demise of Aegina solely to the development of the [[Athenian navy]]. It is probable that the power of Aegina had steadily declined during the twenty years after Salamis, and that it had declined absolutely, as well as relatively to that of Athens. Commerce was the source of Aegina's greatness, and her trade, which seems to have been principally with the Levant, must have suffered seriously from the war with Persia. Aegina's medism in 491 is to be explained by its commercial relations with the Persian Empire. It was forced into patriotism in spite of itself, and the glory won by the [[battle of Salamis]] was paid for by the loss of its trade and the decay of its marine. The completeness of the ruin of so powerful a state is explained by the economic conditions of the island, the prosperity of which was based on slave labour. It is impossible, indeed, to accept Aristotle's (cf. Athenaeus vi. 272) estimate of 470,000 as the number of the slave population; it is clear, however, that the number must have been much greater than that of the free inhabitants. In this respect the history of Aegina does but anticipate the history of Greece as a whole.\n\nThe constitutional history of Aegina is unusually simple. So long as the island retained its independence the government was an [[oligarchy]]. There is no trace of heroic monarchy and no tradition of a ''[[tyranny|tyrannis]]''. The story of Nicodromus, while it proves the existence of a democratic party, suggests, at the same time, that it could count upon little support.\n\n===Hellenistic period and Roman rule===\nAegina with the rest of Greece became dominated successively by the [[Macedon]]ians (322\u2013229 BC), the [[Achaean League|Achaeans]] (229\u2013211&nbsp;BC), [[Aetolian League|Aetolians]] (211\u2013210&nbsp; BC), [[Attalus I|Attalus of Pergamum]] (210\u2013133&nbsp;BC) and the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] (after 133&nbsp;BC).<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> A sign at the Archaeological Museum of Aegina is reported to say that a [[Jew]]ish community is believed to have been established in Aegina \"at the end of the second and during the 3rd century AD\" by Jews fleeing the [[barbarian invasions]] of the time in Greece.<ref>{{Cite sign|title=Mosaic floor of a Jewish synagogue|medium=Sign |publisher=[[Archaeological Museum of Aegina]]|location=Aegina, Greece}}</ref> However, the first phases of those invasions began in the 4th century. Local Christian tradition has it that a Christian community was established there in the 1st century, having as its bishop Crispus, the ruler of the [[Corinth]]ian synagogue, who became a Christian,<ref>{{bibleverse||Acts of the Apostles|18:8|ESV}}</ref> and was baptised by [[Paul the Apostle]].<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|1:14|ESV}}</ref> There are written records of participation by later bishops of Aegina, Gabriel and Thomas, in the [[Council of Constantinople (869)|Councils of Constantinople in 869]] and [[Council of Constantinople (879)|879]].

It remained Eastern Roman during the period of crisis of the 7th\u20138th centuries, when most of the [[Balkans]] and the Greek mainland were overrun by [[Slavs|Slavic]] invasions. Indeed, according to the ''[[Chronicle of Monemvasia]]'', the island served as a refuge for the Corinthians fleeing these incursions.<ref name=\"ODB40\">Kazhdan (1991), p. 40</ref> The island flourished during the early 9th century, as evidenced by church construction activity, but suffered greatly from Arab raids originating from [[Emirate of Crete|Crete]]. Various [[hagiography|hagiographies]] record a large-scale raid {{circa|830}}, that resulted in the flight of much of the population to the Greek mainland. During that time, some of the population sought refuge in the island's hinterland, establishing the settlement of Palaia Chora.<ref name=\"ODB40\"/><ref>Christides (1981), pp. 87\u201389</ref>\n\nAccording to the 12th-century bishop of Athens, [[Michael Choniates]], by his time the island had become a base for pirates.<ref name=\"ODB40\"/> This is corroborated by [[Benedict of Peterborough]]'s graphic account of Greece, as it was in 1191; he states that many of the islands were uninhabited for fear of pirates and that Aegina, along with Salamis and [[Makronisos]], were their strongholds.\n\n===Frankish rule after 1204===\n{{Further|Frankokratia}}\nAfter the dissolution and partition of the Byzantine Empire by the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204, Aegina was accorded to the [[Republic of Venice]]. In the event, it became controlled by the [[Duchy of Athens]]. The [[Catalan Company]] seized control of Athens, and with it Aegina, in 1317, and in 1425 the island became controlled by the Venetians,<ref>Kazhdan (1991), pp. 40\u201341</ref> when Alioto Caopena, at that time ruler of Aegina, placed himself by treaty under the Republic's protection to escape the danger of a Turkish raid. The island must then have been fruitful, for one of the conditions by which Venice accorded him protection was that he should supply grain to Venetian colonies. He agreed to surrender the island to Venice if his family became extinct. [[Antonio II Acciaioli]] opposed the treaty for one of his adopted daughters had married the future lord of Aegina, Antonello Caopena.\n\n===Venetians in Aegina (1451\u20131537)===\n[[File:Markellos tower Aegina Greece.jpg|thumb|The Venetian era Markellos tower]]\n\nIn 1451, Aegina became Venetian. The islanders welcomed Venetian rule; the claims of Antonello's uncle Arn\u00e0, who had lands in [[Argolis]], were satisfied by a pension. A Venetian governor (''rettore'') was appointed, who was dependent on the authorities of Nauplia. After Arn\u00e0's death, his son Alioto renewed his claim to the island but was told that the republic was resolved to keep it. He and his family were pensioned and one of them aided in the defence of Aegina against the Turks in 1537, was captured with his family, and died in a Turkish dungeon.\n\nIn 1463 the [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1463\u20131479)|Turco-Venetian war]] began, which was destined to cost the Venetians [[Euboea|Negroponte]] (Euboea), the island of Lemnos, most of the [[Cyclades]] islands, [[Shkodra|Scudra]] and their colonies in the [[Morea]]. Peace was concluded in 1479. Venice still retained Aegina, [[Naupactus|Lepanto]] (Naupactus), [[Nauplio|Nauplia]], [[Monemvasia]], [[Methoni, Messenia|Modon]], [[Pylos|Navarino]], [[Koroni|Coron]], and the islands [[Crete]], [[Mykonos]] and [[Tinos]]. Aegina remained subject to Nauplia.\n\n====Administration====\nAegina obtained money for its defences by reluctantly sacrificing its cherished relic, the head of St. George, which had been carried there from Livadia by the Catalans. In 1462, the Venetian Senate ordered the relic to be removed to St. Giorgio Maggiore in Venice and on 12 November, it was transported from Aegina by Vettore Cappello, the famous Venetian commander. In return, the Senate gave the Aeginetes 100 [[ducat]]s apiece towards fortifying the island.\n\nIn 1519, the government was reformed. The system of having two rectors was found to result in frequent quarrels and the republic thenceforth sent out a single official styled Bailie and Captain, assisted by two [[councillor]]s, who performed the duties of [[camerlengo]] by turns. The Bailie's authority extended over the rector of Aegina, whereas [[Kastri, Cythera|Kastri]] (opposite the island [[Hydra (island)|Hydra]]) was granted to two families, the [[Palaiologoi]] and the [[Alberti (surname)|Alberti]].\n\nSociety at Nauplia was divided into three classes: nobles, citizens and plebeians, and it was customary for nobles alone to possess the much-coveted local offices, such as the judge of the inferior court and inspector of weights and measures. The populace now demanded its share and the home government ordered that at least one of the three inspectors should be a non-noble.\n\nAegina had always been exposed to the raids of [[Privateer|corsairs]] and had oppressive governors during these last 30&nbsp;years of Venetian rule. Venetian nobles were not willing to go to this island. In 1533, three rectors of Aegina were punished for their acts of injustice and there is a graphic account of the reception given by the Aeginetans to the captain of Nauplia, who came to command an enquiry into the administration of these delinquents (vid. inscription over the entrance of St. George the Catholic in Paliachora). The rectors had spurned their ancient right to elect an islander to keep one key of the money-chest. They had also threatened to leave the island en masse with the commissioner, unless the captain avenged their wrongs. To spare the economy of the community, it was ordered that appeals from the governor's decision should be made on Crete, instead of in Venice. The republic was to pay a [[bakshish]] to the Turkish governor of the Morea and to the [[voivode]] who was stationed at the frontier of Thermisi (opposite Hydra). The fortifications too, were allowed to become decrepit and were inadequately guarded.\n\n====16th century====\n[[File:Aegina - view 05.jpg|thumb|The ruins of Palaiochora. Walls, houses, and castle have been destroyed, only the chapels were restored.]]\nAfter the end of the Duchy of Athens and the [[principality of Achaia]], the only Latin possessions left on the mainland of Greece were the papal city of Monemvasia, the fortress of [[Vonitsa]], the Messenian stations Coron and Modon, Lepanto, Pteleon, Navarino, and the castles of Argos and Nauplia, to which the island of Aegina was subordinate.\n\nIn 1502\u201303, the new peace treaty left Venice with nothing but Cephalonia, Monemvasia and Nauplia, with their appurtenances in the Morea. And against the sack of Megara, it had to endure the temporary capture of the castle of Aegina by [[Kemal Reis]] and the abduction of 2000 inhabitants. This treaty was renewed in 1513 and 1521. All supplies of grain from Nauplia and Monemvasia had to be imported from Turkish possessions, while corsairs rendered dangerous all traffic by sea.\n\nIn 1537, sultan [[Suleyman the Magnificent|Suleiman]] declared war upon Venice and his admiral [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] devastated much of the [[Ionian Islands]], and in October invaded the island of Aegina. On the fourth day Palaiochora was captured, but the Latin church of St George was spared. Hayreddin Barbarossa had the adult male population massacred and took away 6,000 surviving women and children as slaves. Then Barbarossa sailed to Naxos, whence he carried off an immense booty, compelling the Duke of Naxos to purchase his further independence by paying a tribute of 5000 ducats.\n\nWith the peace of 1540, Venice ceded Nauplia and Monemvasia. For nearly 150&nbsp;years afterwards, Venice ruled no part of the mainland of Greece except Parga and Butrinto (subordinate politically to the Ionian Islands), but it still retained its insular dominions [[Cyprus]], Crete, [[Tenos]] and six Ionian islands.\n\n===First Ottoman period (1540\u20131687)===\nThe island was attacked and left desolate by [[Francesco Morosini]] during the [[Cretan War (1645\u20131669)|Cretan War]] (1654).\n\n===Second Venetian period (1687\u20131715)===\n[[File:Rottmann - Landschaft auf der Insel Aegina - 1845.jpeg|thumb|300px|Aegina in 1845, by [[Carl Rottmann]].]]\n\nIn 1684, the beginning of the [[Morean War]] between Venice and the [[Ottoman Empire]] resulted in the temporary reconquest of a large part of the country by the Republic. In 1687 the Venetian army arrived in Piraeus and captured Attica. The number of the Athenians at that time exceeded 6,000, the Albanians from the villages of Attica excluded, whilst in 1674 the population of Aegina did not seem to exceed 3,000 inhabitants, two thirds of which were women. The Aeginetans had been reduced to poverty to pay their taxes. The most significant plague epidemic began in Attica during 1688, an occasion that caused the massive migration of Athenians toward the south; most of them settled in Aegina. In 1693 Morosini resumed command, but his only acts were to refortify the castle of Aegina, which he had demolished during the Cretan war in 1655, the cost of upkeep being paid as long as the war lasted by the Athenians, and to place it and Salamis under Malipiero as Governor. This caused the Athenians to send him a request for the renewal of Venetian protection and an offer of an annual tribute. He died in 1694 and Zeno was appointed at his place.\n\nIn 1699, thanks to English mediation, the war ended with the [[peace of Karlowitz]] by which Venice retained possession of the 7 Ionian islands as well as Butrinto and [[Parga]], the Morea, [[Spinalonga]] and [[Suda]], Tenos, [[Santa Maura]] and Aegina and ceased to pay a tribute for [[Zante]], but which restored Lepanto to the [[Ottoman sultan]]. [[Cerigo]] and Aegina were united administratively since the peace with Morea, which not only paid all the expenses of administration but furnished a substantial balance for the naval defence of Venice, in which it was directly interested.\n\n===Second Ottoman period (1715\u20131821)===\nDuring the early part of the [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1714\u20131718)|Ottoman\u2013Venetian War of 1714\u20131718]] the Ottoman Fleet commanded by Canum Hoca captured Aegina. Ottomans rule in Aegina and the Morea was resumed and confirmed by the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]], and they retained control of the island with the exception of a brief Russian occupation [[Orlov Revolt]] (early 1770s), until the beginning of the [[Greek War of Independence]] in 1821.\n\n===Greek Revolution===\nDuring the Greek War of Independence, Aegina became an administrative centre for the Greek revolutionary authorities. [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]] was briefly established here.\n\n==Landmarks==\n[[File:Aegina port.jpg|thumb|centre|600px|Panorama of Aegina's port.]]\n[[File:Aegina harbour 1.jpg|thumb|View of the port.]]\n[[File:Agios-nectarios-aegina.jpg|thumb|The cathedral of [[Nectarios of Aegina|Saint Nectarios of Aegina]].]]\n[[File:\u0395\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03bc\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u0391\u03af\u03b3\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1.jpg|thumb|Traditional street in the town]]\n[[File:Aigina.JPG|thumb|Aegina town centre.]]\n[[File:Ioannis Capodistrias bust Karakatsanis 1887 Aegina Greece.jpg|thumb|140px|A bust of Kapodistrias]]\n\n* '''[[Temple of Aphaea]]''', dedicated to its namesake, a goddess who was later associated with [[Athena]]; the temple was part of a pre-Christian, equilateral holy triangle of temples including the Athenian [[Parthenon]] and the temple of [[Poseidon]] at [[Sounion]].\n* '''Monastery of Agios Nectarios''', dedicated to [[Nectarios of Aegina]], a recent saint of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]].\n* '''[[Ioannis Kapodistrias]]''' (1776\u20131831), the first administrator of free modern Greece, had a large building constructed; intended as a barracks, it was used subsequently as a museum, a library and a school.

A statue in the principal square commemorates him.\n* '''Temple of Zeus Hellanios''', near the village of Pachia Rachi, is a 13th-century Byzantine church, built on the ruins of the ancient temple to Zeus Hellanios, built in the 4th century BC.  The staircase leading up to the church, some of the original walls, and loose stones from the earlier temple remain.\n\n==Economy==\n===Pistachios===\nIn 1896, the physician Nikolaos Peroglou introduced the systematic cultivation of pistachios, which soon became popular among the inhabitants of the island. By 1950, pistachio cultivation had significantly displaced the rest of the agricultural activity due to its high profitability but also due to the [[phylloxera]] that threatened the [[vineyards]] that time. As a result, in the early 60s, the first pistachio peeling factory was established in the Plakakia area by Grigorios Konidaris. The quality of \"''Fistiki Aeginis''\" (Aegina Pistachios), a name that was established as a product of [[Protected Designation of Origin]] (PDO) in 1996, is considered internationally excellent and superior to several foreign varieties, due to the special climatic conditions of the island (drought) as well as soil's volcanic characteristics. Pistachios have made Aegina famous all over the world. Today, half of the pistachio growers are members of the Agricultural Cooperative of Aegina's Pistachio Producers. It is estimated that pistachio cultivation covers 29,000 acres of the island while the total production reaches 2,700 tons per year. In recent years, in mid-September, the Pistachio Festival has been organized every year under the name \"''Fistiki Fest''\".\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Mythology===\nIn [[Greek mythology]], '''[[Aegina (mythology)|Aegina]]''' was a daughter of the river god [[Asopus]] and the [[nymph]] [[Metope (mythology)|Metope]]. She bore at least two children: [[Menoetius (mythology)|Menoetius]] by [[Actor (mythology)|Actor]], and [[Aeacus]] by the god [[Zeus]]. When Zeus abducted Aegina, he took her to [[Oenone]], an island close to [[Attica]]. Here, Aegina gave birth to Aeacus, who would later become king of Oenone; thenceforth, the island's name was Aegina.\n\nAegina was the gathering place of Myrmidons; in Aegina they gathered and trained. Zeus needed an elite army and at first thought that Aegina, which at the time did not have any villagers, was a good place. So he changed some ants ({{lang-grc|\u039c\u03c5\u03c1\u03bc\u03cd\u03b3\u03b9\u03b1}}, Myrmigia) into warriors who had six hands and wore black armour. Later, the [[Myrmidons]], commanded by [[Achilles]], were known as the most fearsome fighting unit in [[Greece]].\n\n===Famous Aeginetans===\n* [[Aeacus]], the first king of Aegina according to mythology, in whose honour the [[Aeacea]] were celebrated\n* [[Smilis]] (6th century BC), sculptor\n* [[Onatas]] (5th century BC), sculptor\n* [[Ptolichus]] (5th century BC), sculptor\n* [[Philiscus of Aegina]] (4th century BC), Cynic philosopher\n* [[Paul of Aegina]] (7th century), medical scholar and physician\n* [[Athanasia of Aegina|Saint Athanasia of Aegina]] (9th century), abbess and saint\n* [[Cosmas II Atticus]] (12th century), Patriarch of Constantinople\n* [[Nectarios of Aegina]] (1846\u20131920), bishop and saint\n* [[Aristeidis Moraitinis (aviator)]] born 1891, died 1918\n\n*The influential Leoussi family originated on the isle of Aegina; their ancestry can be traced as far back as the 15th century.{{cn|date=June 2018}}\n*[[Gustav Hasford]], American military journalist and novelist, moved to Aegina and died there of heart failure on 29 January 1993, aged 45<ref>{{cite web|website=Findagrave|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/34923728|title=Jerry Gustav \"Gus\" Hasford|}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/thesesdissertations/236/|author=Ross, Matthew Samuel|title=An Examination of the life and work of Gustav Hasford, Paper 236|date=2010|website=UNLV Theses, Dissertations, Professional Papers, and Capstones}}</ref><ref>Lewis, Grover (June 4\u201310, 1993). \"The Killing of Gus Hasford\".

The region contains the country's second largest island, [[Chilo\u00e9 Island|Chilo\u00e9]], and the second largest lake, [[Llanquihue Lake|Llanquihue]].\n\nHistorically, the Huilliche have called this territory between Bueno River and Reloncav\u00ed Sound Futahuillimapu, meaning \"great land of the south\".\n\nIts capital is [[Puerto Montt, Chile|Puerto Montt]]; other important cities include [[Osorno, Chile|Osorno]], [[Castro, Chile|Castro]], [[Ancud, Chile|Ancud]], and [[Puerto Varas, Chile|Puerto Varas]]. The mainland portion of Los Lagos Region south of [[Reloncav\u00ed Sound]] (Palena Province) is considered part of [[Patagonia]].\n\nLos Lagos Region economy is dominated by the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service sector]] but based in [[Fishing in Chile|fishing]], [[aquaculture in Chile|salmon aquaculture]], [[forestry in Chile|forestry]] and [[cattle]] farming. Tourism is economically important in [[Andes]] where [[ski resort]]s, [[hot spring]]s and [[recreational fishing]] are popular offers.\n\nThe region hosts [[Monte Verde]], one of the oldest archaeological sites of the Americas. The largest indigenous group of the region are the [[Huilliche people|Huilliche]] who lived in the area before the arrival of the Spanish. The Spanish crown settled [[Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago]] in 1567<ref name=hanisch>[[Walter Hanisch|Hanisch, Walter]]. ''La Isla de Chilo\u00e9''. 1982. p. 11-12.</ref> while the rest of the region begun to be slowly colonized by non-indigenous people only in the late 18th century. In the 1850s [[German colonization of Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue|Germans arrived]] to colonize the shores of Llanquihue Lake under a Chilean state-sponsored program.\n\n== Geography ==\nThe region is bordered on the north by [[Los R\u00edos Region]], on the south by [[Ais\u00e9n Region]], on the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]] and on the east by [[Argentina]] (provinces of [[Neuqu\u00e9n Province|Neuqu\u00e9n]], [[R\u00edo Negro Province|R\u00edo Negro]] and [[Chubut Province|Chubut]]).

Province|Llanquihue]], [[Osorno Province|Osorno]] and [[Palena Province|Palena]]. The region contains the country's second largest island, [[Chilo\u00e9 Island|Chilo\u00e9]], and the second largest lake, [[Llanquihue Lake|Llanquihue]].\n\nHistorically, the Huilliche have called this territory between Bueno River and Reloncav\u00ed Sound Futahuillimapu, meaning \"great land of the south\".\n\nIts capital is [[Puerto Montt, Chile|Puerto Montt]]; other important cities include [[Osorno, Chile|Osorno]], [[Castro, Chile|Castro]], [[Ancud, Chile|Ancud]], and [[Puerto Varas, Chile|Puerto Varas]]. The mainland portion of Los Lagos Region south of [[Reloncav\u00ed Sound]] (Palena Province) is considered part of [[Patagonia]].\n\nLos Lagos Region economy is dominated by the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service sector]] but based in [[Fishing in Chile|fishing]], [[aquaculture in Chile|salmon aquaculture]], [[forestry in Chile|forestry]] and [[cattle]] farming. Tourism is economically important in [[Andes]] where [[ski resort]]s, [[hot spring]]s and [[recreational fishing]] are popular offers.\n\nThe region hosts [[Monte Verde]], one of the oldest archaeological sites of the Americas. The largest indigenous group of the region are the [[Huilliche people|Huilliche]] who lived in the area before the arrival of the Spanish.

''La Isla de Chilo\u00e9''. 1982. p. 11-12.</ref> while the rest of the region begun to be slowly colonized by non-indigenous people only in the late 18th century. In the 1850s [[German colonization of Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue|Germans arrived]] to colonize the shores of Llanquihue Lake under a Chilean state-sponsored program.\n\n== Geography ==\nThe region is bordered on the north by [[Los R\u00edos Region]], on the south by [[Ais\u00e9n Region]], on the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]] and on the east by [[Argentina]] (provinces of [[Neuqu\u00e9n Province|Neuqu\u00e9n]], [[R\u00edo Negro Province|R\u00edo Negro]] and [[Chubut Province|Chubut]]).

(later '''NeXT Computer, Inc.''' and '''NeXT Software, Inc.''') was an American [[computer]] and [[software]] company founded in 1985 by [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]]. Based in [[Redwood City, California]], the company developed and manufactured a series of [[computer workstation]]s intended for the [[higher education]] and business markets. NeXT was founded by Jobs after he was forced out of Apple, along with several co-workers NeXT introduced the first [[NeXT Computer]] in 1988, and the smaller [[NeXTstation]] in 1990. The NeXT computers experienced relatively limited sales, with estimates of about 50,000 units shipped in total.

Jobs explicitly ensured that NeXT staff did not use the nickname \"[[Pizza box form factor|pizza box]]\", so that the NeXT machines would not be compared to competing Sun workstations which already had that nickname. The magneto-optical drive was replaced with a 2.88 MB floppy drive but 2.88 MB floppy disks were expensive and the technology failed to supplant the 1.44 MB floppy. Realizing this, NeXT utilized the [[CD-ROM]] drive, which eventually became an industry standard for storage. Color graphics were available on the NeXTstation Color and on the [[NeXTdimension]] [[Video card|graphics processor]] hardware for the NeXTcube. The new computers were cheaper and faster than their predecessors, with the new [[Motorola 68040]] processor.\n\nIn 1992, NeXT launched \"Turbo\" variants of the NeXTcube and NeXTstation, with a 33 MHz 68040 processor and the maximum RAM capacity increased to 128 MB. NeXT sold 20,000 computers in 1992, and NeXT counted upgraded motherboards on back order as system sales.

Jobs had experimented with some structural changes at Apple but at NeXT he abandoned conventional corporate structures, instead making a \"community\" with \"members\" instead of employees. There were only two different salaries at NeXT until the early 1990s. Team members who joined before 1986 were paid {{US$|75000|1986}} and those who joined afterward were paid {{US$|50000|1986}}. This caused a few awkward situations where managers were paid less than their employees. Employees were given performance reviews and raises every six months because of the spartan salary plans. To foster openness, all employees had full access to the payrolls, although few employees ever took advantage of the privilege. NeXT's [[health insurance]] plan offered benefits to not only married couples but unmarried couples and same-sex couples, although the latter privilege was later withdrawn due to insurance complications.<ref name=\"The NeXT Big Thing\"/>{{rp|80}} The payroll schedule was also very different from other companies in Silicon Valley at the time because instead of being delivered twice a month in arrears at the end of the pay period, it was delivered once a month in advance.<ref name=\"The NeXT Big Thing\"/>{{rp|289}}\n\nJobs found office space in [[Palo Alto, California]] on 3475 Deer Creek Road, occupying a glass and concrete building which featured a staircase designed by architect [[I. M. Pei]]. The first floor used hardwood flooring and large worktables where the workstations would be assembled. To avoid inventory errors, NeXT used the [[Just-in-time manufacturing|just-in-time]] (JIT) inventory strategy. The company contracted out for all major [[wikt:component|components]] such as mainboards and cases and had the finished components shipped to the first floor for assembly. The second floor was the office space with an open floor plan. The only enclosed rooms were Jobs's office and a few conference rooms.<ref name=\"AppleConfidential\">{{Cite book | first=Owen W. | last=Linzmayer | title=Apple Confidential 2.0 | publisher=No Starch Press | year=2004 |isbn=1-59327-010-0}}</ref>{{rp|323}}\n\nAs NeXT expanded, more office space was needed. The company rented an office at 800 and 900 Chesapeake Drive in Redwood City, also designed by Pei. The architectural centerpiece was a \"floating\" staircase with no visible supports. The open floor plan was retained, although furnishings became luxurious, with $5,000 chairs, $10,000 sofas, and [[Ansel Adams]] prints.<ref name=\"The NeXT Big Thing\"/>{{rp|80}}\n\nNeXT's first campus in Palo Alto was subsequently occupied by [[SAP SE|SAP AG]].

(later '''NeXT Computer, Inc.''' and '''NeXT Software, Inc.''') was an American [[computer]] and [[software]] company founded in 1985 by [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]]. Its name was usually pronounced as \"'''Next'''\". Based in [[Redwood City, California]], the company developed and manufactured a series of [[computer workstation]]s intended for the [[higher education]] and business markets. NeXT was founded by Jobs after he was forced out of Apple, along with several co-workers NeXT introduced the first [[NeXT Computer]] in 1988, and the smaller [[NeXTstation]] in 1990. The NeXT computers experienced relatively limited sales, with estimates of about 50,000 units shipped in total. Nevertheless, their innovative [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] [[NeXTSTEP]] [[operating system]] and [[development environment]] ([[Interface Builder]]) were highly influential.  \n\nThe first major outside investment was from [[Ross Perot]], who invested after seeing a segment about NeXT on a 1986 [[PBS]] documentary titled ''Entrepreneurs''.<ref name=\"RP iPhone\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/90374043/how-ross-perot-helped-bring-us-the-iphone|title=How Ross Perot befriended Steve Jobs and helped bring us the iPhone|last=McCracken|first=Harry|date=2019-07-09|website=Fast Company|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> In 1987, he invested $20 million in exchange for 16 percent of NeXT's stock and subsequently joined the board of directors in 1988.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/iconstevejobsgre00jeff|url-access=registration|title=iCon: Steve Jobs|last=Young|first=Jeffrey S.|last2=Simon|first2=William L.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2005|isbn=0-471-72083-6|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iconstevejobsgre00jeff/page/134 134]}}</ref>\n\nNeXT later released much of the NeXTSTEP system as a [[Application programming interface|programming environment]] standard called [[OpenStep]]. NeXT withdrew from the hardware business in 1993 to concentrate on marketing [[OpenStep#OPENSTEP for Mach|OPENSTEP for Mach]], its own OpenStep implementation, for several [[original equipment manufacturer]]s (OEMs).

Jobs was explicit in ensuring NeXT staff did not use the nickname \"[[Pizza box form factor|pizza box]]\", so that the NeXT machines would not be compared to competing Sun workstations which already had that nickname. The magneto-optical drive was replaced with a 2.88 MB floppy drive but 2.88 MB floppy disks were expensive and the technology did not supplant the 1.44 MB floppy. Realizing this, NeXT utilized the [[CD-ROM]] drive, which eventually became an industry standard for storage. Color graphics were available on the NeXTstation Color and on the [[NeXTdimension]] [[Video card|graphics processor]] hardware for the NeXTcube.

NeXT sold 20,000 computers in 1992, and NeXT counted upgraded motherboards on back order as system sales.

Jobs had experimented with some structural changes at Apple but at NeXT he abandoned conventional corporate structures, instead making a \"community\" with \"members\" instead of employees. There were only two different salaries at NeXT until the early 1990s. Team members who joined before 1986 were paid {{US$|75000|1986}} and those who joined afterward were paid {{US$|50000|1986}}. This caused a few awkward situations where managers were paid less than their employees. Employees were given performance reviews and raises every six months because of the spartan salary plans. To foster openness, all employees had full access to the payrolls, although few employees ever took advantage of the privilege. NeXT's [[health insurance]] plan offered benefits to not only married couples but unmarried couples and same-sex couples, although the latter privilege was later withdrawn due to insurance complications.<ref name=\"The NeXT Big Thing\"/>{{rp|80}} The payroll schedule was also very different from other companies in Silicon Valley at the time because instead of being delivered twice a month in arrears at the end of the pay period, it was delivered once a month in advance.<ref name=\"The NeXT Big Thing\"/>{{rp|289}}\n\nJobs found office space in [[Palo Alto, California]] on 3475 Deer Creek Road, occupying a glass and concrete building which featured a staircase designed by architect [[I. M. Pei]]. The first floor used hardwood flooring and large worktables where the workstations would be assembled. To avoid inventory errors, NeXT used the [[Just-in-time manufacturing|just-in-time]] (JIT) inventory strategy. The company contracted out for all major [[wikt:component|components]] such as mainboards and cases and had the finished components shipped to the first floor for assembly. The second floor was the office space with an open floor plan. The only enclosed rooms were Jobs's office and a few conference rooms.<ref name=\"AppleConfidential\">{{Cite book | first=Owen W. | last=Linzmayer | title=Apple Confidential 2.0 | publisher=No Starch Press | year=2004 |isbn=1-59327-010-0}}</ref>{{rp|323}}\n\nAs NeXT expanded, more office space was needed. The company rented an office at 800 and 900 Chesapeake Drive in Redwood City, also designed by Pei. The architectural centerpiece was a \"floating\" staircase with no visible supports. The open floor plan was retained, although furnishings became luxurious, with $5,000 chairs, $10,000 sofas, and [[Ansel Adams]] prints.<ref name=\"The NeXT Big Thing\"/>{{rp|80}}\n\nNeXT's first campus in Palo Alto was subsequently occupied by [[SAP SE|SAP AG]].

{"title_page": "List of German expressions in English", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=March 2019}}\n{{original research|date=March 2019}}\n}}\n{{Dynamic list}}\n\nA '''German expression in English''' is a [[German language|German]] loanword, term, phrase, or quotation incorporated into the English language. A loanword is a word borrowed from a donor language and incorporated into a recipient language without translation. It is distinguished from a calque, or loan translation, where a meaning or idiom from another language is translated into existing words or roots of the host language. Some of the expressions are relatively common (e.g. ''[[hamburger]]''), but most are comparatively rare. In many cases the [[loanword]] has assumed a meaning substantially different from its German forebear.\n\nEnglish and German both are [[West Germanic languages]], though their relationship has been obscured by the [[Lexicon|lexical]] influence of [[Old Norse]] and [[Norman French]] (as a consequence of the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066) on English as well as the [[High German consonant shift]]. In recent years, however, many English words have been borrowed directly from German. Typically, English spellings of German [[loanword]]s suppress any [[Germanic umlaut|umlauts]] (the superscript, double-dot [[diacritic]] in ''[[\u00c4]]'', ''[[\u00d6]]'', ''[[\u00dc]]'', ''\u00e4'', ''\u00f6'' and ''\u00fc'') of the original word or replace the umlaut letters with ''Ae'', ''Oe'', ''Ue'', ''ae'', ''oe'', ''ue'', respectively (as is done commonly in German speaking countries when the umlaut is not available; the origin of the umlaut was a superscript E).\n\nGerman words have been incorporated into English usage for many reasons:\n*German cultural artifacts, especially foods, have spread to English-speaking nations and often are identified either by their original German names or by German-sounding English names\n*Developments and discoveries in German-speaking nations in [[science]], [[scholarly method|scholarship]], and [[classical music]] have led to German words for new concepts, which have been adopted into English: for example the words ''[[doppelg\u00e4nger]]'' and ''[[angst]]'' in psychology.\n*Discussion of German history and culture requires some German words.\n*Some German words are used in English narrative to identify that the subject expressed is in German, e.g. ''Frau'', ''Reich''.\n\nAs languages, English and German descend from the common ancestor language West Germanic and further back to [[Germanic languages|Proto-Germanic]]; because of this, some English words are essentially identical to their German lexical counterparts, either in spelling (''Hand'', ''Sand'', ''Finger'') or pronunciation (\"fish\" = ''Fisch'', \"mouse\" = ''Maus''), or both (''Arm'', ''Ring''); these are excluded from this list.\n\nGerman common nouns fully adopted into English are in general not initially capitalised, and the German letter \"[[\u00df]]\" is generally changed to \"ss\".\n\n== German terms commonly used in English ==\nMost of these words will be recognized by many English speakers; they are commonly used in English contexts. Some, such as ''wurst'' and ''pumpernickel'', retain German connotations, while others, such as ''lager'' and ''hamburger'', retain none. Not every word is recognizable outside its relevant context.

Regardless of marital status, a woman is now commonly referred to as ''Frau'', because from 1972 the term ''Fr\u00e4ulein'' has been officially phased out for being politically incorrect and should only be used if expressly authorized by the woman concerned.\n* [[F\u00fchrer]] (umlaut is usually dropped in English) \u2013 always used in English to denote [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] or to connote a fascistic leader \u2013 never used, as is possible in German, simply and unironically to denote a (non-fascist) leader or guide (e.g. Bergf\u00fchrer: [[mountain guide]], Stadtf\u00fchrer: city guide [book], F\u00fchrerschein: [[driving licence]], Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer: [[managing director]], Flugzeugf\u00fchrer: [[Pilot in command]])\n* [[Gott mit uns]] \u2013 meaning \"God be with us\", the motto of the Prussian king was used as a morale slogan amongst soldiers in both World Wars. It was bastardized as \"Got mittens\" by American and British soldiers, and is usually used nowadays, because of the German defeat in both wars, derisively to mean that wars are not won on religious grounds.\n* [[wiktionary:H\u00e4nde hoch|H\u00e4nde hoch]] \u2013 \"hands up\"\n* [[wiktionary:Herr|Herr]] \u2013 in modern German either the equivalent of Mr. (Mister), to address an adult man, or \"master\" over something or someone (e.g. ''Sein eigener Herr sein'': to be his own master). Derived from the adjective ''hehr'', meaning \"honourable\" or \"senior\", it was historically a nobleman's title, equivalent to \"Lord\". (''Herr der Fliegen'' is the German title of ''[[Lord of the Flies]]''.) In a religious context it refers to God.\n* [[Ich bin ein Berliner]] \u2013 famous quotation by [[John F. Kennedy]]\n* [[Leitmotif]] (German spelling: ''Leitmotiv'') \u2013 any sort of recurring theme, whether in music, literature, or the life of a fictional character or a real person.\n* [[Meister]] \u2013 used as a suffix to mean expert (''Maurermeister'') or master; in Germany it means also champion in sports (''Weltmeister'', ''Europameister'', ''Landesmeister'')\n* [[wiktionary:Nein|Nein]] \u2013 no\n* [[wikt:Raus|Raus]] \u2013 meaning ''Out!'' \u2013 shortened (colloquial) (depending on where the speaker is, if on the inside \"get out!\" = ''hinaus'', if on the outside \"come out!\" = ''heraus''). It is the [[Imperative mood|imperative]] form of the German [[verb]] ''hinausgehen'' (getting out (of a room/house/etc.) as in the imperative ''gehen Sie raus''!).<ref>http://dictionary.reverso.net/english-german/out%20+%20hand Hinaus or Heraus</ref>\n* [[Reich]] \u2013 from the Middle High German ''rich'', as a noun it means \"empire\" or \"realm\", cf. the English word ''bishopric''. In titles as part of a compound noun, for example ''Deutsche Reichsbahn'', it is equivalent to the English word \"national\" or possibly ''federal'' (the words \"Reich\" and \"Bund\" are somewhat exchangeable in recent history, with the exception of the Nazi state which continued to call itself Reich despite abolishing states). For instance ''Reichsbahn'' ([German] National/Federal Railway), or ''Reichspost'' (National/Federal Postal Service), specifically indicating in either case that the respective institutions were organised by central authority (called the German Reich at the time), not the states. To some English \u2013 and German \u2013 speakers, ''Reich'' in English strongly connotes Nazism and is sometimes used to suggest fascism or authoritarianism, e.g. \"Herr Reichsminister\" used as a title for a disliked politician.\n* Ja \u2013 yes\n* [[wiktionary:Jawohl|Jawohl]] \u2013 a German term that connotes an emphatic ''yes'' \u2013 \"Yes, indeed!\" in English. It is often equated to \"yes, sir\" in Anglo-American military films, since it is also a term typically used as an acknowledgement for military commands in the German military.\n* Schnell! \u2013 \"Quick!\" or \"Quickly!\"\n* [[Kommandant]] \u2013 commander (in the sense of ''person in command'' or [[commanding officer]], regardless of [[military rank]]), used often in the military in general (''Standortkommandant'': [[Military base|base]] commander), on battleships and [[U-Boat]]s (''Schiffskommandant'' or ''U-Boot-Kommandant''), sometimes used on civilian ships and aircraft.\n* [[Schweinhund]] (German spelling: ''Schweinehund'') \u2013 literally: ''Schwein'' \"pig\" and ''Hund'' \"dog\", [[vulgarism]] like in ''der verdammte Schweinehund'' (\"the damned pig-dog\"). But also used to describe the lack of motivation (for example to quit a bad habit): ''den [[:de:innerer Schweinehund|inneren Schweinehund]] bek\u00e4mpfen'' (\"to battle the inner pig-dog\").\n* Wunderbar \u2013 wonderful\n\n==Terms rarely used in English==\n<!-- If a term in this list is common in a particular academic discipline, then please move it to one of the lists above. -->\n* [[Ampelm\u00e4nnchen]]\n* [[Know-it-all|Besserwisser]] \u2013 someone who always \"knows better\"\n* [[Bullshit|Bockmist]], lit. \"billy goat's dung\", meaning \"nonsense\" or \"rubbish\"\n* [[wikt:eierlegende Wollmilchsau|Eierlegende Wollmilchsau]] \u2013 literally \"egg-laying wool-milk-sow\", a hypothetical solution, object or person fulfilling unrealistically many different demands; also referring sometimes to a (really existing) object, concept or person like this, for example a [[multi-tool]] or exceptionally versatile person (jack of all trades)\n* [[Fahrvergn\u00fcgen]] \u2013 \"driving pleasure\"; introduced in a [[Volkswagen]] advertising campaign\n* [[wiktionary:Fremdscham|Fremdscham]], \"vicarious shame\", the shame felt for the behavior of someone else\n* [[Gastarbeiter]] \u2013 \"guest worker\", foreign-born worker\n* [[wiktionary:Geisterfahrer|Geisterfahrer]] \u2013 \"ghost driver\", a wrong-way driver; one who drives in the direction opposite to that prescribed for the given lane.\n* [[G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung]] \u2013 \"Twilight of the Gods\", a disastrous conclusion of events\n* [[Kobold]] \u2013 small mischievous fairy creature, traditionally translated as \"goblin\", \"hobgoblin\" or \"imp\"\n* [[Ordnung muss sein]] \u2013 \"There must be order.\" This proverbial phrase illustrates the importance that German culture places upon order.\n* [[wikt:Schmutz|Schmutz]] \u2013 smut, dirt, filth\n* [[wiktionary:\u00fcber alles|... \u00fcber alles]] \u2013 \"above all\", originally from \"Deutschland \u00fcber alles\", the first line of [[August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben|Hoffmann von Fallersleben]]'s poem \"[[Das Lied der Deutschen]]\" (The Song of the Germans); see also [[\u00dcber Alles (disambiguation)]].\n* [[wiktionary:Verschlimmbessern|Verschlimmbessern]] \u2013 to make something worse in an honest but failed attempt to improve it\n* [[Vorsprung durch Technik]] \u2013 \"competitive edge through technology\", used in an advertising campaign by [[Audi]]\n* [[Zweih\u00e4nder]] \u2013 two-handed sword\n\n== German quotations used in English ==\nSome famous English quotations are translations from German.

A loanword is a word borrowed from a donor language and incorporated into a recipient language without translation. It is distinguished from a calque, or loan translation, where a meaning or idiom from another language is translated into existing words or roots of the host language. Some of the expressions are relatively common (e.g. ''[[hamburger]]''), but most are comparatively rare. In many cases the [[loanword]] has assumed a meaning substantially different from its German forebear.\n\nEnglish and German both are [[West Germanic languages]], though their relationship has been obscured by the [[Lexicon|lexical]] influence of [[Old Norse]] and [[Norman French]] (as a consequence of the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066) on English as well as the [[High German consonant shift]]. In recent years, however, many English words have been borrowed directly from German. Typically, English spellings of German [[loanword]]s suppress any [[Germanic umlaut|umlauts]] (the superscript, double-dot [[diacritic]] in ''[[\u00c4]]'', ''[[\u00d6]]'', ''[[\u00dc]]'', ''\u00e4'', ''\u00f6'' and ''\u00fc'') of the original word or replace the umlaut letters with ''Ae'', ''Oe'', ''Ue'', ''ae'', ''oe'', ''ue'', respectively (as is done commonly in German speaking countries when the umlaut is not available; the origin of the umlaut was a superscript E).\n\nGerman words have been incorporated into English usage for many reasons:\n*German cultural artifacts, especially foods, have spread to English-speaking nations and often are identified either by their original German names or by German-sounding English names\n*Developments and discoveries in German-speaking nations in [[science]], [[scholarly method|scholarship]], and [[classical music]] have led to German words for new concepts, which have been adopted into English: for example the words ''[[doppelg\u00e4nger]]'' and ''[[angst]]'' in psychology.\n*Discussion of German history and culture requires some German words.\n*Some German words are used in English narrative to identify that the subject expressed is in German, e.g. ''Frau'', ''Reich''.\n\nAs languages, English and German descend from the common ancestor language West Germanic and further back to [[Germanic languages|Proto-Germanic]]; because of this, some English words are essentially identical to their German lexical counterparts, either in spelling (''Hand'', ''Sand'', ''Finger'') or pronunciation (\"fish\" = ''Fisch'', \"mouse\" = ''Maus''), or both (''Arm'', ''Ring''); these are excluded from this list.\n\nGerman common nouns fully adopted into English are in general not initially capitalised, and the German letter \"[[\u00df]]\" is generally changed to \"ss\".\n\n== German terms commonly used in English ==\nMost of these words will be recognized by many English speakers; they are commonly used in English contexts. Some, such as ''wurst'' and ''pumpernickel'', retain German connotations, while others, such as ''lager'' and ''hamburger'', retain none. Not every word is recognizable outside its relevant context. A number of these expressions are used in American English, under the influence of German immigration, but not in British English.\n\n=== Food and drink ===\n{{Main|List of German dishes|Austrian cuisine|Swiss cuisine}}\n*[[Berliner Weisse]], [[sour beer]] often infused with fruit syrup (German spelling: ''Berliner Wei\u00dfe'')\n*[[Biergarten]], open-air drinking establishment\n*[[Braunschweiger (sausage)|Braunschweiger]], a liverwurst cold-cut (though in Germany ''Braunschweiger'' describes a smoked ground beef sausage)\n*[[Bratwurst]] (sometimes abbrev.

Indicating marital state, with Frau \u2013 Mrs. and ''Fr\u00e4ulein'' \u2013 Miss; in Germany, however, the diminutive ''Fr\u00e4ulein'' lapsed from common usage in the late 1960s. Regardless of marital status, a woman is now commonly referred to as ''Frau'', because from 1972 the term ''Fr\u00e4ulein'' has been officially phased out for being politically incorrect and should only be used if expressly authorized by the woman concerned.\n* [[F\u00fchrer]] (umlaut is usually dropped in English) \u2013 always used in English to denote [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] or to connote a fascistic leader \u2013 never used, as is possible in German, simply and unironically to denote a (non-fascist) leader or guide (e.g. Bergf\u00fchrer: [[mountain guide]], Stadtf\u00fchrer: city guide [book], F\u00fchrerschein: [[driving licence]], Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer: [[managing director]], Flugzeugf\u00fchrer: [[Pilot in command]])\n* [[Gott mit uns]] \u2013 meaning \"God be with us\", the motto of the Prussian king was used as a morale slogan amongst soldiers in both World Wars. It was bastardized as \"Got mittens\" by American and British soldiers, and is usually used nowadays, because of the German defeat in both wars, derisively to mean that wars are not won on religious grounds.\n* [[wiktionary:H\u00e4nde hoch|H\u00e4nde hoch]] \u2013 \"hands up\"\n* [[wiktionary:Herr|Herr]] \u2013 in modern German either the equivalent of Mr. (Mister), to address an adult man, or \"master\" over something or someone (e.g. ''Sein eigener Herr sein'': to be his own master). Derived from the adjective ''hehr'', meaning \"honourable\" or \"senior\", it was historically a nobleman's title, equivalent to \"Lord\". (''Herr der Fliegen'' is the German title of ''[[Lord of the Flies]]''.) In a religious context it refers to God.\n* [[Ich bin ein Berliner]] \u2013 famous quotation by [[John F. Kennedy]]\n* [[Leitmotif]] (German spelling: ''Leitmotiv'') \u2013 any sort of recurring theme, whether in music, literature, or the life of a fictional character or a real person.\n* [[Meister]] \u2013 used as a suffix to mean expert (''Maurermeister'') or master; in Germany it means also champion in sports (''Weltmeister'', ''Europameister'', ''Landesmeister'')\n* [[wiktionary:Nein|Nein]] \u2013 no\n* [[wikt:Raus|Raus]] \u2013 meaning ''Out!'' \u2013 shortened (colloquial) (depending on where the speaker is, if on the inside \"get out!\" = ''hinaus'', if on the outside \"come out!\" = ''heraus''). It is the [[Imperative mood|imperative]] form of the German [[verb]] ''hinausgehen'' (getting out (of a room/house/etc.) as in the imperative ''gehen Sie raus''!).<ref>http://dictionary.reverso.net/english-german/out%20+%20hand Hinaus or Heraus</ref>\n* [[Reich]] \u2013 from the Middle High German ''rich'', as a noun it means \"empire\" or \"realm\", cf. the English word ''bishopric''. In titles as part of a compound noun, for example ''Deutsche Reichsbahn'', it is equivalent to the English word \"national\" or possibly ''federal'' (the words \"Reich\" and \"Bund\" are somewhat exchangeable in recent history, with the exception of the Nazi state which continued to call itself Reich despite abolishing states). For instance ''Reichsbahn'' ([German] National/Federal Railway), or ''Reichspost'' (National/Federal Postal Service), specifically indicating in either case that the respective institutions were organised by central authority (called the German Reich at the time), not the states. To some English \u2013 and German \u2013 speakers, ''Reich'' in English strongly connotes Nazism and is sometimes used to suggest fascism or authoritarianism, e.g. \"Herr Reichsminister\" used as a title for a disliked politician.\n* Ja \u2013 yes\n* [[wiktionary:Jawohl|Jawohl]] \u2013 a German term that connotes an emphatic ''yes'' \u2013 \"Yes, indeed!\" in English. It is often equated to \"yes, sir\" in Anglo-American military films, since it is also a term typically used as an acknowledgement for military commands in the German military.\n* Schnell! \u2013 \"Quick!\" or \"Quickly!\"\n* [[Kommandant]] \u2013 commander (in the sense of ''person in command'' or [[commanding officer]], regardless of [[military rank]]), used often in the military in general (''Standortkommandant'': [[Military base|base]] commander), on battleships and [[U-Boat]]s (''Schiffskommandant'' or ''U-Boot-Kommandant''), sometimes used on civilian ships and aircraft.\n* [[Schweinhund]] (German spelling: ''Schweinehund'') \u2013 literally: ''Schwein'' \"pig\" and ''Hund'' \"dog\", [[vulgarism]] like in ''der verdammte Schweinehund'' (\"the damned pig-dog\"). But also used to describe the lack of motivation (for example to quit a bad habit): ''den [[:de:innerer Schweinehund|inneren Schweinehund]] bek\u00e4mpfen'' (\"to battle the inner pig-dog\").\n* Wunderbar \u2013 wonderful\n\n==Terms rarely used in English==\n<!-- If a term in this list is common in a particular academic discipline, then please move it to one of the lists above. -->\n* [[Ampelm\u00e4nnchen]]\n* [[Know-it-all|Besserwisser]] \u2013 someone who always \"knows better\"\n* [[Bullshit|Bockmist]], lit. \"billy goat's dung\", meaning \"nonsense\" or \"rubbish\"\n* [[wikt:eierlegende Wollmilchsau|Eierlegende Wollmilchsau]] \u2013 literally \"egg-laying wool-milk-sow\", a hypothetical solution, object or person fulfilling unrealistically many different demands; also referring sometimes to a (really existing) object, concept or person like this, for example a [[multi-tool]] or exceptionally versatile person (jack of all trades)\n* [[Fahrvergn\u00fcgen]] \u2013 \"driving pleasure\"; introduced in a [[Volkswagen]] advertising campaign\n* [[wiktionary:Fremdscham|Fremdscham]], \"vicarious shame\", the shame felt for the behavior of someone else\n* [[Gastarbeiter]] \u2013 \"guest worker\", foreign-born worker\n* [[wiktionary:Geisterfahrer|Geisterfahrer]] \u2013 \"ghost driver\", a wrong-way driver; one who drives in the direction opposite to that prescribed for the given lane.\n* [[G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung]] \u2013 \"Twilight of the Gods\", a disastrous conclusion of events\n* [[Kobold]] \u2013 small mischievous fairy creature, traditionally translated as \"goblin\", \"hobgoblin\" or \"imp\"\n* [[Ordnung muss sein]] \u2013 \"There must be order.\" This proverbial phrase illustrates the importance that German culture places upon order.\n* [[wikt:Schmutz|Schmutz]] \u2013 smut, dirt, filth\n* [[wiktionary:\u00fcber alles|... \u00fcber alles]] \u2013 \"above all\", originally from \"Deutschland \u00fcber alles\", the first line of [[August Heinrich Hoffmann von Fallersleben|Hoffmann von Fallersleben]]'s poem \"[[Das Lied der Deutschen]]\" (The Song of the Germans); see also [[\u00dcber Alles (disambiguation)]].\n* [[wiktionary:Verschlimmbessern|Verschlimmbessern]] \u2013 to make something worse in an honest but failed attempt to improve it\n* [[Vorsprung durch Technik]] \u2013 \"competitive edge through technology\", used in an advertising campaign by [[Audi]]\n* [[Zweih\u00e4nder]] \u2013 two-handed sword\n\n== German quotations used in English ==\nSome famous English quotations are translations from German.
