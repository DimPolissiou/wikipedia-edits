{"title_page": "Historical characters in the Southern Victory Series", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{in-universe|date=August 2015}}\n{{Weasel|date=November 2009}}\n}}\n\nThe [[Southern Victory Series]] is a series of [[alternate history]] novels written by [[Harry Turtledove]]. The [[point of divergence]] involves [[Confederate States of America]] winning the [[American Civil War]] and becoming an independent nation. The series covers events from 1862 to 1945 and features dozens of characters, some of whom were historical figures.\n\n==Books in the series==\n* ''[[How Few Remain]]'' (1997) \u2013 ''HFR''\n* ''[[The Great War: American Front]]'' (1998) \u2013 ''GW:AF''\n* ''[[The Great War: Walk in Hell]]'' (1999) \u2013 ''GW:WH''\n* ''[[The Great War: Breakthroughs]]'' (2000) \u2013 ''GW:B''\n* ''[[American Empire: Blood and Iron]]'' (2001) \u2013 ''AE:BI''\n* ''[[American Empire: The Center Cannot Hold]]'' (2002) \u2013 ''AE:CCH''\n* ''[[American Empire: The Victorious Opposition]]'' (2003) \u2013 ''AE:VO''\n* ''[[Settling Accounts: Return Engagement]]'' (2004) \u2013 ''SA:RE''\n* ''[[Settling Accounts: Drive to the East]]'' (2005) \u2013 ''SA:DE''\n* ''[[Settling Accounts: The Grapple]]'' (2006) \u2013 ''SA:G''\n* ''[[Settling Accounts: In at the Death]]'' (2007) \u2013 ''SA:ID''\n\n==United States==\n\n===Alcott, Louisa May===\n(HFR)\n\nRather than ''[[Little Women]]'', set in a North that was winning the war, '''[[Louisa May Alcott]]''' wrote ''After the War was Lost''.\n\n===Ballou, Charles===\n(AE:VO)\n\n'''[[Charles Clarendon Ballou]]''' is a [[brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in the [[United States Army]], and the base commandant of [[Fort Leavenworth]] when Irving Morrell is posted there in the mid-1930s. It is Ballou who reintroduces [[colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Morrell to Brigadier General Daniel MacArthur, and who reassigns Morrell to be armor commander of MacArthur's occupying force in Houston.\n\n===Baum, L. Frank===\n(GW:AF, AE:VO)\n\nIn a rather odd move on Turtledove's part, '''[[L. Frank Baum]]''' is introduced as an American fighter pilot early in the Great War, this despite the fact that Baum was aged 58 in 1914. (Perhaps there is confusion with his son [[Frank Joslyn Baum]]) Somewhere along the line, Baum still becomes a children's author. Only his book ''[[Queen Zixi of Ix]]'' is mentioned by name, but because the book is an offshoot of ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]'' craze, we can assume he still wrote his most famous book. (However, ''The Wizard of Oz'' was inspired by [[architectural]] exhibits at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World's Fair]] of 1893, which is unlikely to have happened in this timeline, making this plot element questionable.)\n\n===Bernstein, Carl===\n(SA:G)\n\nSergeant '''[[Carl Bernstein]]''' is in charge of a [[U.S. Army]] [[counterintelligence]] squadron that specializes in detecting [[wiretaps]]. He is sent to check [[Congresswoman]] Flora Blackford's office for bugs. Among his team are a 'Bob' (possibly [[Bob Woodward]] or [[H. R. Haldeman]]) and 'Dick' (almost certainly [[Richard Nixon]]). This is an obvious [[anachronism]] for the sake of a laugh, as the Bernstein of our timeline was not born until 1944.\n\n===Blaine, James G.===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[James G. Blaine]]''' was the second and last [[Republican Party (USA)|Republican]] [[president of the United States]]. Elected over Democratic incumbent [[Samuel J. Tilden]] in [[1880 United States presidential election|1880]], he was also known as the only other president to start a war (over the [[Confederate States of America|CSA]]'s purchase of the states of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] and [[Sonora]], giving the Confederacy a [[Pacific]] port) and to lose the war as well. At the end of The [[Second Mexican War]], Blaine started the U.S. tradition of Remembrance Day and also started the alliance with the [[German Empire]], which developed into The [[Central Powers]] of the Great War. As a result of the Us' defeat in the Second Mexican War, Blaine would end up losing the [[1884 United States presidential election|1884 presidential election]] in a landslide.\n\n===Bogart, Humphrey===\n(SA:DE)\n\nIn this timeline, '''[[Humphrey Bogart]]''' still became a movie actor. He starred in the movie ''The Maltese Elephant'', an analog to our timeline's ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (''The Maltese Elephant'' is also the name of a short story in Harry Turtledove's short story collection ''[[Counting Up, Counting Down]]''). Armstrong Grimes thought of Bogart when he learned that his aunt Clara was marrying someone named Humphrey Baxter.\n\n===Booth, John Wilkes===\n(HFR)\n\nWith the South having gained its independence, '''[[John Wilkes Booth]]''' has nothing to be [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|homicidally angry]] about. He and his elder brother '''[[Edwin Booth]]''' remain popular stage actors in both the U.S. and [[Confederate States of America|CSA]] into the 1880s.\n\n===Borah, William Edgar===\n(AE:VO)\n\n[[Herbert Hoover]]'s running mate (Hoover became president after president-elect [[Calvin Coolidge]] died and did not have a vice president) in the [[1936 United States presidential election|1936 election]], '''[[William Edgar Borah]]''' had even some of the most loyal Democrats saying that his vice presidential opponent, [[Fictional characters in the Southern Victory Series#Charles W. La Follette|Charles W. La Follette]], would make a better VP.\n\n===Brown, Mordecai===\n(GW:WH, AE:VO)\n\nKnown only as \"Mordecai\" in the series, '''[[Mordecai Brown|Mordecai \"Three Finger\" Brown]]''', instead of becoming a [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] pitcher, was a crewman on the ''[[United States Ship|USS]] Dakota'' during the [[Great War (Harry Turtledove)|Great War]]. [[Sam Carsten]] noted how Mordecai could work as if he had ten fingers, instead of eight, which was the result of a childhood accident (also suffered by the Brown of our timeline). By 1934, Mordecai was the foreman at a [[Los Angeles]] construction company; one of his employees was Chester Martin, who had moved from [[Toledo, Ohio]] as a result of the [[Great Depression|Business Collapse]]. By the late 1930s, however, Mordecai lost many of his workers, including Martin, as a result of a strike.\n\n===Butler, Benjamin Franklin===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Franklin Butler]]''' had been a politician of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] when the War of Secession began in 1861. He left the party and joined the [[United States Army|Army]] to fight the war. He was best known for commanding the occupation garrison of [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], a post in which he was most thoroughly despised by the locals. When the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] was defeated, Butler was forced to flee New Orleans for his life; the Confederate authorities had promised to hang him for war crimes without a trial. In the aftermath of the war, Butler left the army and returned to politics, this time joining the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] as a hard liner.\n\nWhen the [[Second Mexican War]] began in 1881, Butler was more than enthusiastic to fight it, but as the war progressed and turned against the Union, Butler grew bitter and openly critical of US President [[James G. Blaine]].\n\nIn 1882, Butler was one of several prominent leaders of the Republican Party to attend a convention called by former president [[Abraham Lincoln]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. He resisted Lincoln's proposal to replace hostility toward the Confederate States with workers' rights as the central plank of the party's platform. Butler steadfastly refused to drop his Anti-Confederate policies. He blamed the loss of the war on the social and moral weakness of the country, and that it needed to rebuild itself into a more authoritarian nation if the nation was to ever be triumphant over the Rebels. When he realized he wasn't going to get his way, Butler walked out of the meeting. In the chaos that followed, the Republican Party split, with the Liberal faction joining the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]], while Butler left the Republican Party and rejoined the Democrats, taking all of the Conservative hardliners with him.\n\nAs a result of Butler's actions, the Democratic Party would be pushed further to the right on the political spectrum and would also cause a majority of the party to adopt a hard line foreign policy and the gearing of American society to [[American nationalism|nationalism]] and [[revanchism]].\n\n===Cannon, Clarence===\n(AE:VO)\n\nA [[Socialist Party (USA)|Socialist]] Congressman from [[Missouri]], '''[[Clarence Cannon]]''' becomes [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] during the [[Alfred Emanuel Smith|Smith]] Administration.\n\n===Chaney, Lon===\n(SA:G)\n\n'''[[Lon Chaney, Sr.]]''' appeared as a silent movie star in ''The Phantom of the Catacombs'', which is probably an analog of our timeline's ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]].''\n\n===Clemens, Samuel===\n(Viewpoint Character HFR; SA:DE)\n\n'''[[Samuel Clemens]]''' does not become famous in this timeline as the novelist, travel writer, and essayist [[Mark Twain]]. Here he has lost his family's valuable land in [[Tennessee]] (as it is now part of an enemy nation). He settles down with his family in [[San Francisco]] where he becomes the editor of the ''San Francisco Morning Call'', and is known for his very sarcastic war editorials in the 1880s during the [[Second Mexican War]]. His home is burned by [[British army|British soldiers]] on their way to steal from the [[San Francisco Mint]], and he is briefly suspected of being an enemy agent until Colonel [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] meets with him and determines he is safe. His journalistic work keeps him occupied full-time and he never takes up writing books.\n\nClemens had a different wife and children in this world than he had in our timeline. Unlike our world, one of his offspring grew up to be a famous [[journalist]]: Ophelia Clemens. It was never revealed whatever happened to his other child, Orion.\n\n===Coolidge, Calvin===\n(AE:BI-AE:CCH)\n\n'''[[Calvin Coolidge]]''' was the Democratic politician in the early 1900s. He served as the [[governor of Massachusetts]] in the 1910s and 20s, and was elected to the presidency in [[1932 United States presidential election|1932]]. He is the only man elected [[President of the United States]] never to be inaugurated.\n\nA veteran of the [[Great War (Harry Turtledove)|Great War]], Coolidge rose to prominence during his tenure as the governor of Massachusetts during the 1920s. In [[1928 United States presidential election|1928]], he was the Democratic Party's nominee for president. However, as the United States had been experiencing an economic boom under the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] President [[Upton Sinclair]], Coolidge was readily portrayed as another regressive Democrat. Despite Coolidge's promises to keep the [[Confederate States]] in check, his lack of accomplishment outside of [[Massachusetts]], worked against him. Although he carried all of the [[New England]] states (including his home and birth states of Massachusetts and [[Vermont]]), [[Kansas]], [[Kentucky]], [[Montana]], [[Idaho]], [[Nevada]], and [[Texas Panhandle|Houston]], he lost that election narrowly to the incumbent vice president, Socialist [[Hosea Blackford]]. When Coolidge called Blackford to concede the race, he warned him that a \"[[bull market]] going as high as it is, will fall\". Blackford thought it was just [[:wikt:sour grapes|sour grapes]] and paid no heed. When Coolidge's words [[Stock Market Crash 1929|came true in 1929]] and the Socialists and Blackford were blamed for the crash, he was nominated on the Democratic ticket again in [[1932 United States presidential election|1932]] with [[Herbert Hoover]] as his running mate. He won the 1932 election in a landslide. However, on January 5, 1933, President-elect Coolidge suffered a heart attack while shaving and died, less than a month before he would be inaugurated on February 1. (The Coolidge of our history died on the same date, but after he served as president from 1923 to 1929.) Herbert Hoover took his place as President-elect and would go on to be inaugurated as the thirty first [[President of the United States]] on February 1.\n\n===Curley, Jim===\n(SA:ID)\n\nCongressman '''[[James Michael Curley|Jim Curley]]''' of [[Massachusetts]] was the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party's]] candidate for vice president in the [[1944 United States presidential election|1944 election]]. [[Flora Hamburger|Flora Hamburger Blackford]] questioned this choice because of his role in the [[Boston]] Socialist political machine, though she figured the [[Kansas City]] Democratic machine was more corrupt. The Socialist ticket of [[Charles M. La Follette|Charles W. La Follete]] and Curley lost to the Democratic ticket of [[Thomas E. Dewey]] and [[Harry S. Truman]].\n\n===Custer, George Armstrong===\n(HFR, GW:AF-AE:CCH)\n\nIn this timeline, '''[[George Custer]]''' was not [[Battle of Little Big Horn|killed fighting Indians in 1876]], as this smaller United States appears to have attempted to salve its wounded national pride following the [[War of Secession]] by unleashing a much larger [[US Army]] upon the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes, thus compressing the conquest of the Great Plains into a much shorter timescale. He served in [[Utah]] and [[Montana]] during the Second Mexican War, where he met [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. His forces helped defeat General [[Charles George Gordon|Charles Gordon]]'s invasion of [[Montana]].  A movement to nominate him to succeed [[James G. Blaine]] as [[US President]] flourished briefly but petered out. In the Great War he was a [[lieutenant general]] in the [[United States Army]] and commanded the First Army forces in [[Tennessee]]. He was personally vain, using peroxide to bleach his grey hair and mustache despite his advanced age. He was concerned about his public image, and was furious when he read the reports on him by [[journalist]] [[Richard Harding Davis]]. As a Great War commander, he was unsuited for [[trench warfare]], insisting on mounting large assaults on enemy lines instead of winning by attrition. However, his strategies were perfectly suited for \"barrels,\" the timeline's term for [[tank]]s. Once they were introduced in force he crafted the \"Barrel Roll Offensive,\" an armored breakthrough which ultimately won the Great War for the U.S.\n\nFollowing the war, Custer was appointed to command the occupation forces in Canada, where he survived several [[assassination]] attempts, ultimately killing the man who had tried so determinedly to kill him. Custer was forced into retirement following the election of [[Upton Sinclair]] as president; Secretary of War [[Norman Mattoon Thomas]] served him the papers. He died in 1930 and was buried next to Theodore Roosevelt near [[Robert E. Lee]]'s house in [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington, West Virginia]], in one of several northern [[Virginia]] counties reassigned to [[West Virginia]] after the Great War. His extraordinarily lengthy career, approximately 60 years in the [[US Army]], is roughly analogous to that of the German general [[Paul von Hindenburg]] in our timeline.\n\n===Custer, Thomas===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[Thomas Custer|Tom Custer]]''', in this timeline, was not killed in 1876 alongside his brother George at [[Battle of the Little Bighorn|Little Big Horn]]. He fought alongside his brother during the Second Mexican War in both [[Utah]] and [[Montana]]. In 1881, Tom was killed during the fighting in Montana; this led to his brother George developing a lifelong hatred of the Canadians.\n\n===Daniels, Josephus===\n(GW:AF-GW:B)\n\nAlthough being of Southern origins, '''[[Josephus Daniels]]''' served as Secretary of the [[U.S. Navy]] during the Great War. A destroyer escort was named after him in the Second Great War.\n\n(It is unknown why he is on the USA's side, and it is commonly believed to be an error on the part of author Harry Turtledove. In actual history, Daniels was born in [[Washington, North Carolina]] to a Unionist family; his father was killed by Confederate artillery in January 1865.<ref>http://www.ncmarkers.com/Markers.aspx?ct=ddl&sp=search&k=Markers&sv=B-24%20-%20JOSEPHUS%20DANIELS{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In the ''Southern Victory'' timeline, it may be presumed that the Daniels family moved North after the Union defeat in 1862.)\n\n===Darrow, Clarence===\n(AE:CCH)\n\nWith no Southern states to [[Scopes Trial|interfere with the teaching of evolution]], '''[[Clarence Darrow]]''' practiced [[criminal law]] in the United States. He was famous enough to convince the State of [[Kentucky]] (and the Kentucky State Police head Luther Bliss) that it was wrong in holding Cincinnatus Driver on trumped-up charges.\n\n===Davis, Richard Harding===\n(GW:AF-GW:WH)\n\n'''[[Richard Harding Davis]]''' was a journalist and war correspondent in this timeline as well as ours. He was famous for coverage of the Hispano-Japanese War of 1905, and was a thorn in the side of General [[George Armstrong Custer]]. He died of a heart attack in 1916 observing the trench fighting in the Great War. (In our timeline, he died in the same year of the same cause, but in [[New York City]] instead of a war zone.)\n\n===Debs, Eugene V.===\n(GW:B-AE:BI)\n\nSenator '''[[Eugene V. Debs]]''' was one of the first Socialists to be elected to Congress after the split of the Republican Party. He was the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] candidate for president in [[1908 United States presidential election|1908]], [[1912 United States presidential election|1912]] and [[1916 United States presidential election|1916]]. He ran unsuccessfully for president against [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in both the 1912 and 1916, and was a strong opponent of U.S. involvement in the [[Great War (Harry Turtledove)|Great War]].\n\n===Dewey, George===\n(GW:AF)\n\n'''[[George Dewey]]''' of [[Vermont]] is the admiral who commands the successful U.S. attack on the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]] early the Great War, in 1914. There are passing similarities between this fictional battle and the real [[Battle of Manila Bay]].\n\nDewey may or may not have commanded the Navy during the Battle of the Three Navies\u2014the commander is never named. If it is not Dewey, it is [[Bradley Fiske]], who evidently succeeded Dewey. Dewey would have been 77 at the time of the Battle, and Fiske was over a decade younger.\n\n===Dewey, Thomas E.===\n(SA:ID)\n\n'''[[Thomas Dewey]]''' was governor of New York when he received the Democratic nomination for president in [[1944 United States presidential election|1944]]. He and his running mate [[Harry S. Truman]] of [[Missouri]] defeat the incumbent [[Fictional characters in the Southern Victory Series#Charles W. La Follette|Charles W. La Follette]]. His victory is partially attributed to pointing out that the CSA was able to regain strength and attack the United States on the watch of three Socialist Presidents (conveniently downplaying Democrat [[Herbert Hoover]], who made no efforts to stop the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]).\n\nAt his inauguration on February 1, 1945, President Dewey pledged to continue US occupation of the CS with the intention of re-integrating the southern states back into the Union, even though over 82 years had passed since the Confederate States had won its independence in the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]] (1861\u20131862) with the support of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and [[Second French Empire|France]]. He pledged to continue La Follette's policy of racial equality in the armed services. Furthermore, he proposed a continued partnership with the United States' traditional ally, the [[German Empire]], to police the world and prevent the spread of superbomb technology to their former enemies, [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. Given that it was widely believed that Dewey would lose the election, the front-page headline of the November 8, 1944 edition of the [[Chicago Tribune]] inaccurately read \"[[Dewey Defeats Truman|La Follette Defeats Dewey]]\". Vice President-elect Truman was photographed holding up a copy of the paper by the media. Dewey was elected at the age of 42, tying the first Socialist president Upton Sinclair (who was elected to the first of two terms in [[1920 United States presidential election|1920]], defeating the Democratic incumbent [[Theodore Roosevelt]]) as the youngest president in US history. He also was the first president born in the 20th century whereas Sinclair was the first born after the War of Secession.\n\nDewey's victory might be intended to parallel [[Clement Attlee]]'s surprising landslide victory over [[Winston Churchill]] at the end of the Second World War in our timeline. His U.S.-German partnership is reminiscent of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[Four Policemen]] idea.\n\n===Douglass, Frederick===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[Frederick Douglass]]''' was still trying to tell the United States of the suffering of the [[African-American]] slaves in the Confederacy twenty years after the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]]. His pleas were heard only by the small minority of freedmen in the US and a handful of whites. He also, ironically, becomes one of the first people (in his mind) to approve of the \"Revenge\" mindset that the United States picked up in the [[Second Mexican War]] in fighting the [[Confederate States of America|CSA]].\n\n===Fields, W.C.===\n(SA:DE)\n\n'''[[W.C. Fields]]''' still becomes a film comic, and retains his trademark line \"All things considered, I'd rather be in [[Philadelphia]],\" perhaps inspired by the city becoming the de facto capital of the U.S.\n\n===Fiske, Bradley===\n(GW:B)\n\n'''[[Bradley Fiske]]''' is a rear admiral during the Great War. He is the force commander of the U.S. fleet that assists Chile in its war against Argentina in 1917. He appears briefly to congratulate Sam Carsten and Vic Crosetti for tipping off the military to [[Hawaii]]an spy John Liholiho.\n\n===Foulke, William Dudley===\n(HFR, GW:AF)\n\nThis American politician, lawyer, and poet appears at the beginning of ''How Few Remain''. Before the war starts '''[[William Dudley Foulke|William Foulke]]''' is an infantry captain of the United States Army. [[Jeb Stuart]] wonders what a stuck-up young man is doing out west. He reappears in 1915 as Irving Morrell's divisional commander in southeastern Kentucky.\n\n===Foxx, Jimmie===\n(SA:DE)\n\nInstead of becoming a Hall of Fame first baseman, '''[[Jimmie Foxx]]''' was a running back in the U.S. football league. His name was used as a password in Irving Morrell's army to identify Confederate spies.\n\n===Garfield, James===\n(HFR)\n\nSenator '''[[James Garfield]]''' is one of the Republican Party leaders who gather in [[Chicago]] in 1882 to discuss the party's future. He is more conservative than former president [[Abraham Lincoln]] and wishes not to make the party more radical.\n\n===Gehrig, Lou===\n(AE:CCH)\n\n'''[[Lou Gehrig]]''' played professional football in this timeline as a member of the [[Philadelphia]] [[tanks|Barrels]] team. When asked about earning more money than [[US President]] [[Hosea Blackford]], he responded, \"I had a better year than he did,\" echoing [[Babe Ruth]]'s comments about [[Herbert Hoover|President Hoover]] in our timeline.\n\n===Goldwater, Barry===\n(AE:VO)\n\n'''[[Barry Goldwater]]''' was a Democratic Congressman from [[New Mexico]] noted for his [[anti-Mormon]] speeches and rabble rousing during the days and months leading up to Second Great War. (Note that the New Mexico of this timeline included [[Arizona]], home to our timeline's Goldwater.)\n\n===Grant, Ulysses S.===\n(HFR, AE:BI)\n\nGeneral '''[[Ulysses Grant]]''', in the twenty years after the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]], is a broken down, poor man. Known for his victories in a war the United States had few in, he was one of the few people left in the United States who supported the plight of [[African-Americans]] in both North American republics. Grant died from complications from [[alcoholism]].\n\n===Greenberg, Hank===\n(SA:DE)\n\nInstead of becoming a Hall of Fame first baseman for the [[Detroit Tigers]], '''[[Hank Greenberg]]''' was a prominent U.S. running back. His name was used as a code in Irving Morrell's army to prevent Confederate spies from infiltrating U.S. lines.\n\n===Guffey, Joseph===\n(SA:RE)\n\n'''[[Joseph F. Guffey]]''' was the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|U.S. Speaker of the House]] during the Smith and La Follette administrations. When [[Al Smith]] was killed in the Confederate bombing raid of Philadelphia in 1942, Guffey announced the President's death to a joint session of Congress.\n\n===Halsey, William Frederick Jr.===\n(SA:RE)\n\nA Rear Admiral of the Southern Shore Squadron, '''[[Bill Halsey]]''' was part of the MacArthur plan to land and attack at the mouth of the [[James River]] until General Abner Dowling contacted the War Department to stop that plan. From Dowling's statement on him, it seems he is as reckless as MacArthur.\n\n===Hamlin, Hannibal===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[Hannibal Hamlin]]''' was [[Vice President of the United States]] under President [[Abraham Lincoln]] from 1861 to 1865. In the [[1864 United States presidential election|1864 election]], and in the aftermath of the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]], he and Lincoln were defeated in a landslide. Hamlin would later serve as [[United States Secretary of State|secretary of state]] in the [[James G. Blaine]] administration and is chosen to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflict leading up to the Second Mexican War, a task in which he was not successful.\n\nIn 1882, Hamlin was one of several prominent Republican leaders to attend a convention called by Lincoln at the Florence Hotel in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. He resisted Lincoln's proposal to replace hostility toward the Confederacy with workers' rights as the central plank of the party's platform. The rejection of this proposal led to Lincoln's defection to the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] and the end of the Republican Party as an effective force in American politics.\n\n===Haywood, Bill===\n(GW:WH)\n\nLike he was in our timeline, '''[[Bill Haywood|\"Big Bill\" Haywood]]''' is a [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] bigwig in the U.S. during the Great War. He is introduced to Flora Hamburger by Herman Bruck at a [[May Day]] rally, and eyes her with lust.  Flora doesn't seem to like him, but does acknowledge that he brings a furious energy to the cause that makes him a force to be reckoned with.\n\n===Hemingway, Ernest===\n(GW:WH, AE:CCH-AE:VO)\n\nKnown only as \"Ernie\", the novelist '''[[Ernest Hemingway]]''' was an [[ambulance]] driver in the U.S. Army on the [[Qu\u00e9bec]] front in the Great War (in our timeline Hemingway drove an ambulance in [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Italy]] during [[World War I]]), Ernest was strafed by a [[Royal Flying Corps|British aircraft]] and severely wounded in the groin. After the war, his [[impotence]] served as a constant frustration. He ghost-wrote Sylvia Enos' book, ''I Sank Roger Kimball'', and was involved in an affair with his client. He accidentally shoots her when attempting [[suicide]] while he is drunk. He then shoots himself in remorse. (In our timeline, Hemingway lived to 1961, shooting himself to death but no one else.) In the Southern Victory Series,  he never becomes a prominent author\u2014though he does have work published.\n\n===Holmes, Oliver Wendell===\n(GW:WH-AE:VO)\n\n'''[[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]]''' becomes Chief Justice of the United States rather than associate justice, as he does in our timeline. He is one of the last surviving [[US Civil War|War of Secession]] veterans and manages to outlive even General [[George Armstrong Custer]]. Holmes is a staunch Democratic supporter, who is very displeased in 1920 at having to administer the oath of office to [[Upton Sinclair]], the first Socialist President. He dies in 1935 (the same year of his death in our timeline) during [[Herbert Hoover]]'s administration. He is replaced as Chief Justice by Cicero Pittman in time for [[Al Smith]]'s inauguration in 1937.\n\n===Hoover, Herbert===\n(AE:CCH-AE:VO)\n\n'''[[Herbert Hoover]]''' was part of the Coolidge-Hoover Democratic ticket that defeated the Blackford-[[Hiram Johnson|Johnson]] Socialist ticket during the Democratic sweep in [[1932 United States presidential election|1932]]. When President-Elect [[Calvin Coolidge]] died less than a month before he got into office, Hoover took over. The only thing his term was known for was making the situation in [[Kentucky]], [[Texas Panhandle|Houston]], [[Oklahoma|Sequoyah]], and [[Utah]] worse. He ended the Pacific War with a [[status quo ante bellum]] \"peace\" with [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] and allowed [[Jake Featherston]] to begin rebuilding the [[Confederate Army]] in the face of the \"black rebellion\". Hoover was also derided for not doing anything to help the [[Great Depression]]. Because of this, the Democrats were defeated with a Socialist sweep the Congressional elections of 1934 and he lost the presidential race to Socialist [[Al Smith]] in [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]]. The term \u201c[[Hoovervilles]]\u201d still exists in this alternate timeline albeit created by the Socialists to denote the continued existence of \u201cBlackfordboroughs\u201d (shanty towns built as a result of the Business Collapse in 1929) during Hoover's presidency and to detract from the legacy of his failed Socialist predecessor, Hosea Blackford.\n\n===Humphrey, Hubert===\n(AE:VO)\n\n'''[[Hubert Humphrey]]''' is referred to as the \"[[pharmacist]] from [[Minneapolis]].\" He wisely decides not to move his business to [[Rosenfeld, Manitoba]], where the local [[general store]] (owned by an American) had been bombed by Mary MacGregor Pomeroy several years before.\n\n===Johnson, Hiram===\n(AE:CCH)\n\n'''[[Hiram Johnson]]''' was the Socialist nominee for vice-president in both the [[1928 United States presidential election|1928]] and [[1932 United States presidential election|1932 elections]]. He and [[Hosea Blackford]] won the 1928 election over [[Calvin Coolidge]]; the victory was clinched after the Socialists won Johnson's home state of [[California]]. He was present at the Socialist party rally that was held on the same day that [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] raided [[Los Angeles]]. Blackford and Johnson were easily defeated in 1932 by Coolidge and [[Herbert Hoover]].\n\n===Kennedy, Joseph P. Sr.===\n(AE:CCH-AE:VO, SA:ID)\n\n'''[[Joseph Kennedy]]''', in this timeline, was a Democratic Party [[organizer (party)|organizer]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. Although married to [[Rose Kennedy]] and the father of [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.]], he attempted to seduce Sylvia Enos, who was a minor heroine for killing Roger Kimball, and was campaigning for him at his political rallies.\n\nAfter the Second Great War, Kennedy helped obtain the discharge of George Enos Jr., from the navy to allow him to return to civilian life.\n\n===Kennedy, Joseph Jr.===\n(SA:RE)\n\n'''[[Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.|Joseph Kennedy, Jr.]]''' is a [[fighter pilot]] serving in the same squadron as Jonathan Moss during Operation [[Blackbeard]]. It is unknown whether he survived the Second Great War. In our timeline, he did not survive [[World War II]].\n\n===La Follette, Robert M.===\n(GW:WH)\n\n'''[[Robert M. La Follette]]''' was a Socialist U.S. Senator from [[Wisconsin]]. In 1916, he won re-election handily. His son [[Fictional characters in the Southern Victory Series#Charles W. La Follette|Charles]] (who is primarily modeled after his real life son [[Robert M. La Follette, Jr.]]<ref>https://twitter.com/HNTurtledove/status/1000485494503849985</ref>) went on to become a key figure of American history in the 1930s and '40s.\n\n===LaGuardia, Fiorello===\n(AE:VO)\n\n'''[[Fiorello LaGuardia]]''' is elected [[Governor of New York]] on the Socialist ticket and attends the [[New York City]] Remembrance Day parade shortly before the beginning of the Second Great War.\n\n===Lansing, Robert===\n(GW:B)\n\n'''[[Robert Lansing]]''' was the [[United States Secretary of State]] at the conclusion of the Great War in 1917, and was responsible for drafting the terms of the [[peace treaty]] with the [[Confederate States]] and setting policy for Occupied Canada.\n\n===Liggett, Hunter===\n(AE:BI-AE:CCH)\n\n'''[[Hunter Liggett]]''' replaced General [[Leonard Wood]] as Army Chief of Staff under President [[Upton Sinclair]]. He appeared unenthusiastic about some of the Socialists' more unrealistic policies.\n\n===Lincoln, Abraham===\n(HFR, GW:AF)\n\nIn this timeline, '''[[Abraham Lincoln]]''' was a one-term president who was defeated in the [[1864 United States presidential election|1864 election]] in a landslide, and who was generally remembered as a failure. After his presidency, he travels around the country as an [[orator]] advocating for labor rights. In 1881, feeling that the Republican party was no longer true to its original roots, he led a faction of the party to break off and join the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] with Marxist activist [[Friedrich Sorge]], which eventually became the major opposition to the Democrats and one of the two main parties in the American political system. After which, he spends the rest of his days in seclusion outside [[Chicago]].\n\nIn the prologue of ''Great War: American Front,'' while considering the mediation put forth by British ambassador Richard Lyons, Lincoln makes a solemn vow that the United States would find European allies to someday get even with England and France for their violating of the [[Monroe Doctrine]] and helping of the CSA. Though laughed at by Lyons, his prediction would eventually come true by the Great War.\n\n===Lincoln, Mary Todd===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[Mary Todd Lincoln]]''' was the wife of former President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. As her husband was not assassinated in 1865, she did not suffer from mental illness. In the late 1870s, Mary Lincoln died of typhus.\n\n===Mahan, Alfred Thayer===\n(GW:WH)\n\n'''[[Alfred Mahan]]''' was a two-term Democratic president from 1889 to 1897. During his time in office, Mahan threatened to declare war on the Confederate States because of a proposal by the CSA to build a canal in Nicaragua in order to reach their Pacific port in Guaymas, Sonora, without having to travel around South America. After receiving the threat of war, the CSA backed down in their attempt to build the canal. [[Fictional characters in the Southern Victory Series#Carsten, Sam|Sam Carsten]] mentions that he might be the best President the country had ever had before [[Theodore Roosevelt]].\n\n===Moran, Edward===\n(AE:VO)\n\nCongressman '''[[Edward C. Moran, Jr.]]''' of [[Maine]] is a Democrat who debates Flora Blackford on whether or not the United States should interfere with the treatment of blacks in the [[Confederate States of America|CSA]].\n\n===Patrick, Mason===\n(GW:AF-GW:B)\n\n[[Brigadier General]] '''[[Mason Patrick]]''' was a senior aviator in the [[U.S. Army]] air service and served on the [[Canada|Canadian]] front in the Great War.\n\n===Pershing, John \"Black Jack\"===\n(GW:AF-AE:CCH)\n\n'''[[John Pershing]]''' was commanding general of the US Second Army and rival of [[George Custer]]'s First Army in the Great War. After the Socialist victory over the Democrats, he became [[military governor]] of [[Utah]]. In 1929, a [[Mormon]] sniper killed him, and he was succeeded by Colonel Abner Dowling, erstwhile commandant of [[Salt Lake City]].\n\n===Pitney, Mahlon===\n(AE:BI)\n\nRather than being appointed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1912, as he was in our timeline, '''[[Mahlon Pitney]]''' goes to Canada to preside over trials in occupied country.\n\n===Pope, John===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]]''' was the commander of U.S. forces in [[Utah]] during the Second Mexican War. He was responsible for ordering the [[execution]] of several [[Mormon]] leaders during the attempted revolt in Utah. Pope also arrested former president [[Abraham Lincoln]] for allegedly having Mormon sympathies, but President [[James Blaine]] ordered Lincoln's release.\n\n===Reagan, Ronald===\n(AE:VO)\n\n'''[[Ronald Reagan]]''', \"Dutch\", like this timeline's counterpart, was a sports announcer in [[Iowa]] between the wars. His favorite phrase in games is \"There he goes again\" (similar to one of Reagan's most familiar phrases in our timeline, \"[[There you go again]]\"). Cincinnatus Driver also describes \"Dutch\" as a \"great communicator\", a description applied to the historical Reagan.\n\n===Reed, Thomas Brackett===\n(GW:AF)\n\n'''[[Thomas Brackett Reed]]''' was a Democratic president sometime in the late 1890s. Like [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]], Reed was considered a hero of the Remembrance ideology. Reed entered the United States into a mutual-defense pact with [[Haiti]]. Presumably this helped curb [[Confederate States of America|CSA]] designs in the [[Caribbean]] while at the same time irritating the CS government, which had long desired the destruction of the former slave colony. This pact was reaffirmed by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] during the Great War.\n\nReed was depicted on a [[United States half dollar coin|fifty-cent coin]] used as currency during the Great War.\n\n===Rickover, Hyman G.===\n(SA:ID)\n\nCaptain '''[[Hyman G. Rickover]]''', [[U.S. Navy]] testifies before a House of Representatives committee, as an expert on [[submarines]] (as he was in our timeline).  Rickover has the unpleasant task of explaining why the U.S. has not yet built copies of [[German High Seas Fleet]] submarines.\n\n===Rogers, Will===\n(AE:VO)\n\n'''[[Will Rogers]]''' is referred to as \"that comic from [[State of Sequoyah|Sequoyah]]\" (an [[Oklahoma]] native in our timeline). As in our timeline, he is quoted as having said, \"All I know is what I read in the newspapers.\"\n\n{{anchor|Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt|Roosevelt, Franklin}}\n\n===Roosevelt, Franklin D.===\n(AE:CCH, SA:RE-SA:ID)\n\n'''[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]''' is Secretary of War in the [[Herbert Hoover]] administration and later Assistant Secretary of War under the [[Alfred E. Smith]] and [[Fictional characters in the Southern Victory Series#Charles W. La Follette|Charles W. La Follette]] Administrations. He is not much in the public eye, but plays a key role being in charge of the United States [[Manhattan Project|nuclear program]] at the [[Hanford site]]. Roosevelt is [[paraplegic]] and uses a [[wheelchair]]. He has a platonic affair with Flora Blackford. There is no mention of his being married in this timeline to [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]. It noted that his son (who goes unnamed) is in the [[US Navy]] during the Second Great War.\n\n===Roosevelt, Theodore===\n(HFR-AE:CCH)\n\n'''[[Theodore Roosevelt]]''', called '''Teddy''' or '''TR''' in the press, became a national figure for leading a volunteer cavalry unit, the \"Unauthorized Regiment,\" in the [[Second Mexican War]], during which he developed an intense rivalry with [[George Custer]]. A member of the Democratic Party, he was [[President of the United States]] from 1913 to 1921. Roosevelt was the first president to run for a third term, but he was ultimately defeated by Socialist [[Upton Sinclair]] in [[1924 United States presidential election|1920]]. After he died suddenly of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] while [[golf]]ing in 1924, he was buried at [[Robert E. Lee]]'s house in [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]] which had been annexed to [[West Virginia]] from [[Virginia]] after the Great War. He died in 1919 in our timeline.\n\n===Rosecrans, William===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[William Rosecrans]]''' was a lead general in the Second Mexican War. He was partly responsible for the U.S. defeat as he admitted to observers on the [[Kentucky]] front that he had no real strategy to defeat the [[Confederate States]].\n\n===Sevareid, Eric===\n(SA:ID)\n\n'''[[Eric Sevareid]]''' was a [[radio]] broadcaster for U.S. Wireless [[Atlanta]], which was established after the fall of Atlanta, possibly to counter Confederate Connie. After the death of [[Jake Featherston]], Sevareid was one of the broadcasters who interviewed Cassius Madison.\n\n===Shaw, Robert Gould===\n(GW:AF)\n\nIronically, '''[[Robert Gould Shaw]]''', the man who in our timeline led the [[54th Massachusetts]], one of the first all black regiments in the [[US Civil War]], ends up surviving through the War of Secession, though losing a hand in the process, and lives on until 1914 in [[Boston]]. He was depicted as an elderly [[racist]] with little money.\n\n===Sherman, William T.===\n(HFR)\n\nDespite having fought with valor and distinction at the historical [[Battle of Bull Run (disambiguation)|Battles of Bull Run]] and [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]], the victories of '''[[William Tecumseh Sherman]]''' amounted to nothing after the United States' defeat at [[Camp Hill, Glenn Springs, South Carolina|Camp Hill]] and the encirclement of [[Washington, DC]]. Sherman was stripped of his rank of [[brigadier general]] and would never command regular troops again.  Sherman remained in the [[US Army]] and by 1881, he commanded the defences of [[San Francisco]] from his headquarters at the [[Presidio of San Francisco|Presidio]]. When the Second Mexican War began later that year, Sherman organised volunteers and harbour guns in preparation for any attacks. His efforts were mocked by [[Samuel Clemens]] in his newspaper, the San Francisco ''Morning Call''. Because of this, he investigated Clemens on suspicion that he was a Confederate agent, but found nothing to substantiate it and gave Clemens a letter to that effect.\n\nAs the war dragged on, the [[Royal Navy]] of the United Kingdom turned up the pressure against the United States in support of their Confederate ally and attacked San Francisco. In spite of Sherman's preparations, the harbour guns were ineffective and his troops proved inadequate in stopping the [[Royal Marines]] from raiding the [[San Francisco Mint]]. After the raid, Sherman was ridiculed in the city's papers. However, after the cease fire was called, Sherman loudly insisted that with more fortifications, he could make the city impregnable.\n\n===Shirer, William===\n(SA:ID)\n\n'''[[William Shirer]]''' is a U.S. broadcaster who interviews Cassius Madison in his tour of the U.S. after killing [[Jake Featherston]].\n\n===Sinclair, Upton===\n(AE:BI-AE:VO)\n\n'''[[Upton Sinclair]]''' was the first [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] President. He was elected over [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in the [[1920 United States presidential election|1920 election]] for a number of reasons, including (but not limited to) worker unrest, outrage at Roosevelt's decision to run for a third term, and the public's general exhaustion with the Remembrance ideology. His first acts were to slash the military budget, force [[George Custer|General Custer]] into retirement and enact new labor laws. He was re-elected in [[1924 United States presidential election|1924]], where he and the Socialist Party take credit for the [[Roaring Twenties]] prosperity. Sinclair declined to run for a third term in [[1928 United States presidential election|1928]] and was succeeded in office by his vice president, [[Hosea Blackford]], who defeated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic candidate]] [[Calvin Coolidge]] by a narrow margin.\n\n===Smith, Al===\n(AE:VO-SA:RE)\n\n'''[[Al Smith]]''' is elected as the third Socialist (and first [[Catholic]]) President in the [[1936 United States presidential election|1936 election]], defeating Democrat [[Herbert Hoover]]. He is known as the \"Happy Warrior\" since he tries everything to keep the United States out of war with [[Jake Featherston]]'s [[Confederate States]], including the infamous Richmond Agreement, helping to gain him re-election over [[Robert A. Taft|Robert Taft]] in [[1940 United States presidential election|1940]]. All of Smith's efforts simply delay the inevitable; Featherston scraps any agreement with Smith and once again demands territorial concession.  Smith refuses, touching off the Second Great War in June, 1941 (in an operation patterned after OTL's [[Operation Barbarossa]]). Smith is killed in his second term (1942) when Confederate bombers blew up parts of [[Powel House]] and destroy his [[bunker]].\n\nSmith shares parallels with [[Neville Chamberlain]], who attempted, but failed, to prevent war in our timeline with a [[fascist]] regime through the use of [[appeasement]].\n\n===Smith, Kate===\n(SA:G)\n\n'''[[Kate Smith]]''' was a famous U.S. singer in this timeline as well as ours. In 1943, she sang \"[[God Bless America|God Bless the Stars and Stripes]]\" with backing by [[Satchmo]] and the Rhythm Aces.\n\n===Sousa, John Philip===\n(GW:AF and AE:BI)\n\nThe marches of '''[[John Philip Sousa]]''' in this timeline were very popular in the United States. The Socialists despised him as a tool who substituted nationalist desires for vengeance for the class struggle, but respected his talents.\n\n===Stassen, Harold===\n(SA:ID)\n\n'''[[Harold Stassen]]''' was peripherally mentioned as \"the governor of [[Minnesota]]\" as the Republican Party's candidate for president in the [[1944 United States presidential election|1944 election]], carrying electoral votes from the four states of [[Minnesota]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Kansas]], and [[Indiana]] in a three-way race against Socialist [[Fictiobal characters in the Southern Victory Series#Charles W. La Follette|Charles W. LaFollette]] and Democrat [[Thomas E. Dewey]].\n\n===Stearns, Foster===\n(SA:G)\n\n'''[[Foster Waterman Stearns|Foster Stearns]]''' is a United States Congressman from [[New Hampshire]], in office during the second Great War. He is on the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the war, along with [[Fictional characters in the Southern Victory series#Flora Hamburger|Flora Hamburger]] and [[Robert A. Taft|Robert Taft]]. It is Stearns who learns from the hospital and reveals to his fellow legislators that Taft was killed in a [[Suicide attack|people bombing]].\n\n===Stedman, Seymour===\n(AE:BI)\n\n'''[[Seymour Stedman]]''' was a Socialist Congressman from [[Ohio]]. In the Socialist-majority Congress of 1919, he was elected [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]]. Stedman became the first non-Democrat since 1881 to be elected as Speaker.\n\n===Sutro, Adolph===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[Adolph Sutro]]''' is still the mayor of [[San Francisco]], [[California]] as in our timeline. His mayorship was heavily criticized for incompetence, particularly after the British [[Royal Navy]] bombarded the city and [[Royal Marines]] raided the [[San Francisco Mint]]. Sutro was a supporter of President [[James G. Blaine]] and designed several outlandish security measures to protect San Francisco (which was an extremely low priority target) from attack during the Second Mexican War. Ironically, when the British did attack the city, the defenses Sutro proposed proved worthless.\n\nOne of Sutro's most vocal critics was [[Samuel Clemens]], who named his dog Sutro as an insult to the mayor.\n\n===Taft, Robert===\n(AE:VO, SA:DE-SA:G)\n\n'''[[Robert A. Taft]]''' was a Democratic Senator from [[Ohio]] who ran against [[Al Smith]] in the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 presidential election]]. Taft was narrowly defeated running his campaign on an anti-Freedom Party line and the refusal to permit the states of [[Kentucky]] and [[Texas Panhandle|Houston]] to hold a [[plebiscite]] to return to the [[Confederate States of America|CSA]]. During the Second Great War, he and former rival Flora Blackford (who had known [[William H. Taft|his father]] before him) became fast friends and political allies as Flora became more hawkish as the war went on. Taft died in 1943, a victim of a [[Mormon]] [[suicide bomber]] in [[Philadelphia]].\n\n===Taft, William Howard===\n(GW:B-AE:BI)\n\n'''[[William Howard Taft]]''' was a Democratic Congressman from [[Ohio]] who served on the Transportation Committee during the later days of the Great War. He was on the same committee as Socialist congresswoman Flora Hamburger, and the two frequently disagreed on many political issues. His son [[Robert A. Taft]] became an important ally of hers during the Second Great War.\n\n===Thomas, Norman===\n(AE:BI-AE:CCH)\n\n'''[[Norman Thomas|N. Mattoon Thomas]]''' served as Undersecretary of War in the [[Upton Sinclair]] Administration, often as Sinclair's hatchet man. He was responsible for informing General [[George A. Custer]] of his forced retirement and for closing down the [[tank|Barrel]] Works.\n\n===Tilden, Samuel J.===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[Samuel Tilden]]''' was [[President of the United States]] from 1877 to 1881. He was nominated by the Democrats for [[1880 United States presidential election|reelection in 1880]], but lost to Republican [[James G. Blaine]]. Tilden was defeated for not taking a hard line against the Confederate States and for ordering the removal of twelve stars (representing the former Union states in the [[Confederate States of America|CSA]]) from the U.S. flag.\n\n===Truman, Harry===\n(SA:ID)\n\n'''[[Harry Truman]]''' was a Democratic Senator from [[Missouri]] who was selected by [[New York Governor]] [[Thomas E. Dewey]] as the Democratic VP candidate in [[1944 United States presidential election|1944]]. The Dewey-Truman ticket defeated the incumbent President [[Fictional characters in the Southern Victory Series#Charles W. La Follette|Charles W. La Follette]]. In announcing the Democratic victory, Truman had a copy of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' that had the inaccurate headline \"[[Dewey Defeats Truman|La Follete Beats Dewey]]\". Truman made an appearance in occupied [[Florida]] to speak to U.S. soldiers before his inauguration as vice president. He made it clear to the locals that the United States would be firm in the former Confederate States, but that they would be no firmer than needed, and that if they worked together they could one day be part of the same country once again.\n\n===Voorhis, Jerry===\n(AE:VO)\n\n'''[[Jerry Voorhis]]''' was the United States ambassador to the [[Confederate States]] prior to the start of the Second Great War. After delivering news to [[Jake Featherston]] that U.S. president [[Al Smith]] refused the latest C.S. territorial demands, the C.S. president told Voorhis to leave the country within 24 hours; soon after this meeting, Featherston authorized the commencement of Operation [[Blackbeard]].\n\n===Wallace, Henry===\n(SA:RE)\n\n'''[[Henry A. Wallace]]''' was [[US Secretary of the Interior]] under [[Al Smith]]. He was one of the few people who knew of the United States' plans to develop [[nuclear weapons]] during the Second Great War.\n\n===Wayne, John===\n(AE:VO)\n\n'''[[John Wayne]]''' is an actor known in this world under his real name, '''Marion Morrison'''. He played [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in a movie that recounted the details of the Battle of [[Montana]] in ''How Few Remain''.\n\n===Willkie, Wendell===\n(AE:VO)\n\n'''[[Wendell Willkie]]''' was the Republican nominee for president in the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 election]], both in this timeline and our history. As the Republicans had become a third party in this timeline, Willkie was not considered to seriously contend for the presidency. On election day, he only carried the electoral votes from his home state of [[Indiana]] and came in third after [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] incumbent [[Al Smith]] and the Democratic challenger [[Robert A. Taft|Robert Taft]]. Ironically, Willkie's slogan was \"Win With Wendell\".\n\n===Winchell, Walter===\n(SA:ID)\n\n'''[[Walter Winchell]]''' was a news reporter from [[New York City]] who was one of those to interview Cassius Madison after he shot [[Jake Featherston]]. During his interview with Winchell, Cassius found his accent difficult to understand.\n\n===Wood, Leonard===\n(GW:AF-GW:B)\n\nGeneral '''[[Leonard Wood]]''' was Chief of the General Staff of the U.S. Army during the Great War.\n\n===Yount, Barton K.===\n(SA:ID)\n\n'''[[Barton Kyle Yount]]''' is a [[United States Army]] [[major general (United States)|major general]], and as the Second Great War ends, he commands what is possibly the largest air training center in the world, just outside of [[Dayton, Ohio]]. He offers Jonathan Moss the opportunity to train to fly [[jet aircraft|turbo aircraft]]. Moss gladly takes him up on his offer.\n\n==Confederate States==\n\n===Arango, Doroteo===\n(GW:AF-GW:WH, AE:BI)\n\nDuring the Great War, '''[[Pancho Villa|Doroteo Arango]]''' (known by the ''[[nom de guerre]]'' \"Pancho Villa\" in our timeline) was the Radical Liberal presidential candidate in the 1915 election. He promised he would fight the war against the United States even harder than [[Woodrow Wilson]] did. He is also the first non-white candidate to seriously run for the presidency of the Confederacy and showed the wartime strains on the ruling Whig Party, as the war dragged on and the United States' numbers and the Red Rebellion started to strain the Confederates. He was not opposed due to his ethnicity (Mixed \"Mestizo\" Mexican), only his political views. The [[Mexican Revolution]] in which our timeline's Pancho Villa had a major role has its counterpart in the Republican revolt against the [[Habsburg]] Emperors of this timeline's [[Second Mexican Empire|Mexico]], which is crushed with the help of Freedom Party stalwarts. However, in the Confederate-annexed parts of Mexico, it is the Freedom Party itself which mobilises the peasants to overthrow the centuries-old rule of the big landowners.\n\n===Benjamin, Judah===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[Judah P. Benjamin]]''' was [[Confederate States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] under President [[Jefferson Davis]], and served in the Cabinets of many others of the Confederacy's first generation of leaders. He led his country's diplomatic efforts in the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]]. During the presidency of [[James Longstreet]], Judah Benjamin was the ambassador to the United States. Despite his best efforts, he was not able to prevent the [[Second Mexican War]] of 1881\u201382.\n\nDuring the closing days of the Second Mexican War, Benjamin became aware that Senator [[Wade Hampton III]] was attempting to recruit support for a coup should Longstreet go through with his plans to end slavery. He also knew that Hampton had unsuccessfully attempted to recruit [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas Jackson]], a fact which surprised Jackson.\n\n===Black, Hugo===\n(AE:CCH)\n\n'''[[Hugo Black]]''' was the Whig Party's vice-presidential nominee in 1933 during the Freedom electoral sweep. He ran with [[James Longstreet]]'s grandson [[Fictional characters in the Southern Victory Series#Samuel Longstreet|Samuel Longstreet]], and was caught in a riot against Freedom Party stalwarts during the 1933 Election Riots. The Longstreet-Black ticket lost in a landslide to the [[Jake Featherston|Featherston]]-Knight ticket. This defeat made it the first Presidential election in Confederate history where the Whig candidates lost.\n\n===Castro, Fidel===\n(SA:G)\n\nKnown by his first name only, '''[[Fidel Castro]]''' is a young leader of an anti-Freedom Party group in Confederate Cuba, working closely with the United States which sends him clandestine shipments of arms and ammunition.\n\n===Carter, Jimmy===\n(SA:DE)\n\nA [[Confederate Navy]] sailor, '''[[Jimmy Carter]]''' (1924-1942) was on leave and found himself informally in charge of the defense of his hometown of [[Plains, Georgia]] when the black rebels raided the town. He was killed by Jonathan Moss in front of his mother, \"[[Lillian Gordy Carter|Miss Lillian]]\". In our timeline, he remains alive in 2020.\n\n===Chapman, Ben===\n(AE:VO)\n\nInstead of becoming notorious in the [[baseball]] world for his attitude towards [[Jackie Robinson]], '''[[Ben Chapman (baseball)|Ben Chapman]]''' serves in the Freedom Party guards as a Chief Assault Band Leader (a captain in Army ranking). His first and only appearance in the books is when he shows up at Camp Dependable in the dead of night to drop off [[Willy Knight]] as a political prisoner.\n\n{{anchor|Nathan Bedford Forrest III}}\n\n===Forrest, Nathan Bedford III===\n(AE:VO-SA:ID)\n\nA great-grandson of [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] was the head of the Confederate General Staff. Instead of airplane warfare, '''[[Nathan Bedford Forrest III]]''', was a [[tank|barrel]] expert. Forrest was valued by [[Jake Featherston]] because he was unafraid to tell the President the truth about how the war was going, instead of being a \"yes man\" and only telling him what he wanted to hear. When an increasingly stubborn Featherston rejects Forrest's advice to cut short the [[Pittsburgh]] Campaign, thus dooming [[George Patton]]'s entire army of irreplaceable veterans to death or surrender, he begins plotting with Clarence Potter based on concerns about Featherston's sanity and whether new leadership was needed, for Forrest fears a Confederate loss and what the Yankees would do if they defeated the Confederacy again.\n\nWith the Confederate war effort collapsing, Forrest attempted to execute a coup to oust Featherston in 1944, analogous to the [[July 20 Plot]], but was thwarted by the President. Forrest never revealed that he had ever discussed the failed coup with Potter. Eventually, Forrest was killed off for his attempt.\n\n===Gresham, James Bethel===\n(SA:G)\n\n[[James Bethel Gresham]] is a Kentuckian who was among the first Confederate soldiers to be killed in the Great War. Michael Pound and his [[Tank|barrel]] platoon capture a bridge named in Gresham's honor. In our timeline, James Bethel Gresham was born in [[Kentucky]], but moved to [[Indiana]] when he was young. Gresham is considered the first Hoosier serviceman (and perhaps the first American serviceman) to die in [[World War I]].\n\n===Hope, Bob===\n(SA:RE)\n\n'''[[Bob Hope]]''' is a comic seen entertaining the troops in Occupied [[Ohio]]. He was booed offstage for his non realistic war jokes and for not being \"[[Satchmo]] and the Rhythm Aces\".\n\n===Howard, Robert E.===\n(AE:CCH)\n\nThe Conan the Barbarian creator is an unnamed reference in a Jefferson Pinkard chapter as a contributor to Aeroplane Adventures. The book references a young Texan author from Cross Plains where Howard lives for most of his short life; in reality this would have been around the time he wrote \u2018The Shadow Kingdom\u2019, which was published in Weird Times.\n\n===Jackson, Thomas J. \"Stonewall\"===\n(HFR)\n\nBecause of the Confederate victory in 1862, '''[[Stonewall Jackson]]''' did not die in 1863 as he did in our timeline. In the twenty years from the [[US Civil War|War of Secession]] to the Second Mexican War, Jackson became the head of the Confederate General Staff in the [[James Longstreet]] Administration. His brilliant tactics in the Second Mexican War led to victory for the Confederacy. Also critical to the Confederate cause was his decision to let the captured [[Frederick Douglass]] go free, after a memorable debate between the two showing some grudging mutual respect - a decision which eventually helped the Confederacy cement British and [[Third French Republic|French]] support for its cause. Subsequently, Jackson refused [[Wade Hampton III]]'s proposal to lead a coup against Longstreet after Longstreet began steps to end slavery.\n\nHis face appeared on the Confederate five-dollar coin, which naturally came to be called a \"Stonewall\".\n\n===Lamar, Lucius Q. C.===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar (II)|Lucius Lamar]]''' is the vice president of the Confederate States under his cousin [[James Longstreet]]. It is mentioned that Lamar would have acted as president should anything have happened to President Longstreet while he visited the war front in [[Kentucky]].\n\n===Lee, Robert E.===\n(GW:AF)\n\n'''[[Robert E. Lee]]''' is the Confederacy's military hero. It is his decision to invade [[Maryland]], and the complete failure of Union general [[George B. McClellan|George McClellan]] to respond that allows the CS to gain military victory, and receive recognition as a country from Britain and France.\n\nLee appears briefly in the prologue of GW:AF, which is set in 1862. He is heavily referenced throughout the series.\n\nIn AE:CCH, we learn that a man named 'Lee' was president. As Robert E. Lee was never said to have been president in the prior volumes, nor so described in subsequent volumes, a debate has developed among fans of the series, with some arguing that Robert E. was president, while others favor his more political nephew, [[Fitzhugh Lee]].\n\nThere is one apparent difference between Turtledove's character and the historic Lee. In our timeline, Lee became the president of Washington College in [[Lexington, Virginia]] immediately after the Civil War. He served in that role until his death in 1870, at which time the college adopted its current name of [[Washington and Lee University]]. In the Southern Victory Series, the college never added Lee's name\u2014it is referenced in several books in the series as Washington University.\n\n===Long, Earl===\n(AE:VO)\n\nAfter the assassination of their sibling, we learn that one of Governor [[Huey Long]]'s brothers is involved in some sort of machine gun \"accident\" and the other is imprisoned at \"Camp Dependable\" outside Alexandria, Louisiana for his brother's non-Freedom Party politics. Although in our timeline Huey Long had three brothers, George, Julius and '''[[Earl Long]]''', in the Southern Victory Series he has only two.\n\n===Long, Huey===\n(AE:CCH-AE:VO)\n\nIn this timeline, '''[[Huey Long]]''' was a Radical Liberal governor of [[Louisiana]] in the [[Confederate States]]. Like [[Jake Featherston]], he used strong-arm tactics to suppress opposition and control that state, erected prison camps for political opponents, but did not resort to anti-black [[racist]] demagoguery. He proved to be a danger to the Freedom Party in the 1932 elections and afterwards, where the Freedom Party was under attack in his state, and planned to run for president once Featherston ended his term (at the time, the clause in the Confederate constitution restricting a president to a single term was still in force). He was later killed by an assassin of the Freedom Party in 1938 after getting a warning about not following Jake Featherston's orders from [[Anne Colleton]]. (He lived 3 years longer than he did in our timeline.) This assassination allowed Featherston to have the entire Confederacy under his control. The conquest of Louisiana from Long and his followers is roughly the analogue of [[Hitler]]'s Austrian [[Anschluss]].\n\n===Longstreet, James===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[James Longstreet]]''' was a victorious Confederate general turned president of the CSA serving 1880\u20131886. Although having a reputation as being an opportunist, his term was known for the second defeat of the United States in the Second Mexican War and the [[manumission]] of the [[slaves]] as the price of British and French alliance for help in the Second Mexican War. Longstreet also prevented, with [[Stonewall Jackson]]'s help, a planned rebellion by [[Wade Hampton III]].\n\n===Mahon, George===\n(AE:VO)\n\n'''[[George H. Mahon|George Mahon]]''' was a Freedom Party Congressman from the State of [[Texas Panhandle|Houston]] who was among the Congressmen (from Houston and [[Kentucky]]) who demanded that plebiscites be held in order to return to the Confederate States (Houston had joined the U.S. in 1917). He eventually got his wish, and on January 7, 1941, Houston, along with Kentucky, was returned to the [[Confederate States of America|CSA]] by popular vote, and was restored to the state of [[Texas]].\n\n===McReynolds, James Clark===\n(AE:CCH-AE:VO)\n\n'''[[James Clark McReynolds]]''' was the last Chief Justice of the Confederate Supreme Court. He played a key role in the ruling allowing Burton Mitchel to run again out of fear of the Freedom Party after the Hampton assassination. Later he was noted for his battles in the early months of the first [[Jake Featherston]] administration, most importantly the \"torpedoing\" of the River and Dam Act. (This is roughly analogous to the opposition of McReynolds to much of [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] legislation in our timeline.) This led to the Featherston Administration finding a way to abolish the Supreme Court before it could strike down any more Freedom laws, (analogous to FDR's [[Court Packing]] plan in our timeline) and because Featherston wanted to settle accounts with the Court for its allowing Mitchel to run for re-election.\n\nAttorney General Ferdinand Koenig pounced on the precedent of the CSA not having a Supreme Court for the first five years of existence, and forced McReynolds to admit to the legality of that precedent as prelude to having the Supreme Court knocked down, to great fanfare across the Confederacy's white population. Threatened with his life by Featherston if he trifled with the abolition of the Supreme Court, McReynolds retired into private life. The Confederate president then went on the [[radio]] to declare: \"James McReynolds has made his decision, now let him enforce it!\" (echoing [[Worcester v. Georgia#Jackson's response|a quote attributed to Andrew Jackson]] following an 1832 U.S. Supreme Court decision).\n\n===Patman, Wright===\n(SA:ID)\n\n'''[[Wright Patman]]''' was the [[Governor of Texas]] during the Second Great War. In 1944, with the U.S. close to defeating the [[Confederate States of America|C.S.]], Patman seceded his state from the Confederacy and declared an independent [[Republic of Texas]] with himself as president. His first act was to obtain an armistice with the U.S., who immediately recognized his nation, although they continued stationing large numbers of soldiers there. To win brownie points with his new overlords, he turned over all Confederate [[war criminals]] that could be found in Texas, including [[Jefferson Pinkard]], for [[crimes against humanity]] trials.\n\n===Patton, George S.===\n(SA:RE-SA:ID)\n\nGeneral '''[[George S. Patton]]''', [[C.S. Army]], was in charge of the Confederate armored forces (Army of [[Kentucky]]) in Operation [[Blackbeard]] in [[Ohio]] and the attack on [[Pittsburgh]]. He had many of the same character traits as our timeline's Patton: strict attention to detail in a soldier's appearance, high standards and a short temper, highly-effective use of armor, and a seemingly-limitless drive and energy that inspired great confidence among the soldiers serving under him and made him an outstanding commander. But Patton in this timeline is also a different man known to us: instead of being the first American general to integrate his combat formations, this Patton is an unabashed racist and strong supporter of the Freedom Party.\n\nPatton was evacuated from the pocket at Pittsburgh before it fell in February 1943. He unsuccessfully tried to hold the U.S. Army out of Kentucky and [[Tennessee]]. This included an [[George S. Patton slapping incidents|incident]] where he slapped a soldier suffering from [[Combat stress reaction|battle fatigue]]. He would have shot the soldier save that other soldiers around them threatened to shoot Patton on the spot. He was reprimanded for this incident by President [[Jake Featherston]], who promised the average soldier a fair shake. Patton intensely disliked Brigadier General Clarence Potter and would have fought him in a duel had Featherston not forbidden it.\n\nPatton was a fierce and aggressive commander, but as the war turned against the Confederate States, Patton's instincts to attack every chance he got largely succeeded only in squandering men and materiel that the Confederacy could not easily replace. Patton's aggressiveness was checked by General [[Irving Morrell]], a punning reference to the real Patton's African contest with [[Erwin Rommel]]. When he switched tactics to fight a delaying action in [[Chattanooga]], he was bypassed by a U.S. airborne assault on the hills overlooking the city. Because of this, the U.S. drove to [[Atlanta]], disgracing him in Jake Featherston's eyes.\n\nBy 1944, Patton was forced to flee Atlanta and head into [[Alabama]]. With the U.S. ravaging his army, Patton was eventually forced to surrender in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]]. After giving a farewell address to his forces, his men crowded around to say their own goodbyes, an act which moved Patton to tears. He was subsequently taken in as a prisoner of war.\n\nNote: Though a [[Virginia]]n in the Southern Victory timeline, in our timeline Patton was born in [[California]]. In our timeline, General Patton's father, [[George S. Patton (attorney)|George William Patton]], was born in Virginia before Civil War, later moved to California in 1877. General Patton's grandfather, [[George S. Patton, Sr.]] was a Confederate colonel from Virginia killed in 1864 (an event which would not have happened in the alternate timeline). Because of Confederate won the Civil War in this timeline, General Patton's father wasn't likely to move to California, which is a Northern territory. With a Virginian military family background, it is highly possible that General Patton play the role as a Confederate General in an alternative world which Confederate won.\n\n===Russell, Richard Brevard Jr.===\n(AE:VO)\n\n'''[[Richard Brevard Russell, Jr.]]''' was the Confederate Ambassador to the United States before the Second World War. He was kicked out of the U.S. after President [[Jake Featherston]] kicked out the Confederacy's U.S. ambassador [[Jerry Voorhis]] from the C.S. as well.\n\n{{anchor|Sennacherib_.28.22Satchmo.22.29|Louis Armstrong|Satchmo}}\n\n===Satchmo===\n(AE:VO, SA:RE-SA:G)\n\nKnown in the Southern Victory world as '''Sennacherib (\"Satchmo\")''', [[Louis Armstrong]] in the [[Confederate States]], during the rise of the Freedom Party and the Featherston Administration, was the leader of the popular band \"Satchmo and the Rhythm Aces\". He was forced by the Confederate government during Second Great War to play for Confederate troops in Ohio. Satchmo and his band were able to escape to U.S. lines at night after one of their shows. In ''[[Drive to the East]]'', Satchmo and his band share the horrors of the Featherston government's treatment of [[African-Americans]] with Flora Blackford.  Subsequently, Satchmo and the Rhythm Aces produce [[propaganda]] for the U.S., although their style of music, unknown outside of the C.S., is a bit of a mystery to the average U.S. citizen.\n\n===Stuart, James Ewell Brown===\n(HFR)\n\nBecause of the CSA's victory in 1862, '''[[Jeb Stuart]]''' did not die in 1864 [[Battle of Yellow Tavern|as he did in history]]. During the Second Mexican War, General Stuart arrived in the former [[Second Mexican Empire|Mexican]] provinces of [[Sonora]] and [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] in order to ease their transition into C.S. territories (later states). After joining forces with [[Geronimo]] for raids on [[Arizona|western New Mexico]], Stuart was killed by an [[Apache]] [[sniper]] near the close of the war in 1882. His son Jeb Stuart Jr. (a person who had never known his father in real life) later became head of the Confederate War Department, and his (fictionalized) grandson Jeb Stuart III was a battery command officer on the [[Virginia]] front in the Great War.\n\nJ.E.B Stuart III once prevented Army intelligence from interrogating his manservant.  Later it was revealed that this servant had been a spy and a [[communist]] rebel. Stuart was humiliated, and assured by many that he would never rise above the rank of captain, despite his father's position in the war department. Destroyed, Stuart decided glory was all he had left, and died leading a charge across No Man's land.\n\nThis would greatly impact history, because it was [[Jake Featherston]] who had reported the man servant, and Stuart's father blamed him for his son's humiliation.  He ensured that Featherston also was never promoted, which infuriated Featherston forever after, leading him to write his infamous book ''Over Open Sights'', and later to purge the old military upon his ascension to [[President of the Confederate States]].  After that point, promotion and rank in the new army was based solely on talent and loyalty, which unfortunately for the United States, worked very well in the opening months of Operation [[Blackbeard]].\n\n=== Stuart, James Ewell Brown, Jr. ===\n(HFR, AE:BI, AE:VO)\n\nIt is debatable whether \"Jeb Stuart Jr.\" in this series is a historical character or a fictional one, see his article on [[Fictional characters in the Southern Victory Series#Stuart, Jeb Jr.|a different page]].\n\n===Thurmond, Strom===\n(SA:RE)\n\n'''[[Strom Thurmond]]''' was a Freedom Party Congressman from [[South Carolina]]. He is as conservative in this timeline as he was in ours. His name is never mentioned, but the viewpoint character [[Anne Colleton]] thinks of him as \"Storm, or something like that.\" Good on the \"[[Negro]] question, but weaker elsewhere\" was the view expressed of him by Anne, who was killed during the June 1941 [[U.S. navy]] raid on [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] just after Thurmond gave a speech. It is unknown whether Thurmond was killed in the same raid.\n\n===Walker, George Herbert===\n(SA:DE)\n\n[[Confederate Secretary of State]] during the Featherston Administration, '''[[George Herbert Walker]]''' is probably one of the few remaining old-liners to remain from the Whig Era into the Freedom Regime, since he is not considered to be part of the Freedom Party inner circle by Featherston. Walker is placed in charge of obtaining more soldiers from [[Second Mexican Empire|Mexico]] to aid the Confederacy after General Morrell's attacks destroyed the first three divisions in the 1942 U.S. offensive in [[Ohio]].\n\nThis is a little bit implausible, as Walker was from [[Missouri]] and his father [[David Davis Walker]] was from [[Illinois]], neither of which were Confederate states in this timeline or ours.\n\n===Wilson, Woodrow===\n(GW:AF-GW:WH)\n\n'''[[Woodrow Wilson]]''' was [[President of the Confederate States of America|President of the Confederate States]] from 1910 to 1916 on the Whig Party. He led the [[Confederate States of America|CSA]] to war with the United States in the summer of 1914, following the US declaration of war on the Confederacy.\n\n==Native Americans==\n\n===Geronimo===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[Geronimo]]''' led a band of [[Apache]] warriors into an alliance with [[Jeb Stuart]]'s army during the Second Mexican War. The alliance would not outlast the war. He led a rebellion against the Confederates following a dispute in territory occupied in [[New Mexico]]. During this, one of Geronimo's men shot and killed Stuart, which consequently led the Confederate Army to all but wipe the Apache tribes out.\n\n==Mormons==\n\n===Taylor, John===\n(HFR)\n\nThe [[Mormon]] leader '''[[John Taylor (Mormon)|John Taylor]]''' takes the opportunity to try to force the United States to recognize the believers' right to [[Mormonism and polygamy|practice]] [[polygamy]]. However, with the use of the new [[Gatling gun]] his rebellion is quickly crushed and he becomes a fugitive, facing death along with the other Mormon leaders if he is caught. The Union army places a price on his head, but he is never captured.\n\n==Canada==\n\n===Borden, Robert===\n(GW:AF)\n\n'''[[Robert Borden]]''' becomes [[Prime Minister of Canada]] during the Great War years in both our history and Turtledove's novels. When Canada was ceded to the U.S. after the war, his government was ejected from the occupied territory.\n\n==United Kingdom==\n\n===Churchill, Winston===\n(AE:VO, SA:RE-SA:ID)\n\n'''[[Winston Churchill]]''', in this timeline as in the real one, was the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]. He leads his nation into the [[Settling Accounts|Second Great War]] on what appears to be a platform of rearmament, restoration of the [[British Empire|British Empire's]] former borders, and a military alliance with France and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] aimed at reversing the [[German Empire|German Empire's]] dominant position in the world.\n\nAlthough he was a member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], his government's actions were strongly influenced by Silver Shirt leader [[Oswald Mosley]], who wielded much greater power and influence in the right-leaning revanchist Britain. In our timeline Mosley's [[British Union of Fascists]] were known as [[Blackshirts]], though Turtledove may be referencing the American fascist group linked to [[Bruno Hauptmann]] and the [[Lindbergh kidnapping|Lindbergh]] Baby case. It is unknown how his half-American heritage has influenced his relationship with the U.S. or whether his mother was still [[Jennie Jerome]], born in the [[Cobble Hill, Brooklyn|Cobble Hill]] section of [[Brooklyn]].\n\nChurchill authorized the British [[atomic bomb|superbomb]] attack on [[Hamburg]], and retaliated to the German superbomb attacks on [[London]], [[Norwich]], and [[Brighton]] by sending a plane with a second superbomb to attack Germany. However, the plane was shot down over Belgium and landed and detonated harmlessly between [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent, Belgium|Ghent]], all but ending Britain's chances to defeat Germany. Churchill was then ousted as Prime Minister in a no-confidence vote, and was succeeded by [[Horace Wilson (civil servant)|Horace Wilson]], who sought a cease-fire with Germany.\n\n===Edward VIII===\n(SA:ID)\n\nWith relations between the U.S. and the United Kingdom so bad in this timeline, '''[[Edward VIII]]''' never meets [[Wallis Simpson]], and so never abdicates his throne.  He is still the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|king of the United Kingdom]] when [[German Empire|Germany]] drops a [[Nuclear weapon|superbomb]] on [[London]]. Sam Carsten guesses that Edward VIII and his family got out of London even before the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] hit [[Hamburg]], knowing that the Germans would strike back.\n\n===George V===\n(AE:BI)\n'''[[George V]]''' was the King of the United Kingdom during the Great War. He was the last British monarch to hold a number of titles afforded to the ruler of the [[British Empire]], including the King of Ireland and the [[Monarch of Canada|King of Canada]], both of which he was forced to relinquish by the victorious [[Central Powers]].\n\nDuring the Great War, he relinquished all German titles and styles on behalf of his relatives who were British subjects; and changed the name of the royal house from [[Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]] to [[House of Windsor|Windsor]]. In the face of the United Kingdom's defeat in 1917, this act was token at best.\n\n[[Jake Featherston]] derisively compared [[Wade Hampton V]] to the British King during the 1921 Confederate States Presidential Election, a somewhat provocative act considering how staunchly Britain had supported the Confederate States.\n\nUpon his death on 20 January 1936 (the date of the death of the historic George V), he was succeeded by his oldest son [[Edward VIII]], who led the United Kingdom to defeat at the hands of the Central Powers in the Second Great War.\n\n===Halifax, Lord===\n(SA:ID)\n\n'''[[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]]''' was the British ambassador to the [[Confederate States]] during the Second Great War. He presented to [[C.S. President]] [[Jake Featherston]] materials on the British [[atomic bomb|superbomb]] project, which possibly helped the Confederacy develop their own superbomb.\n\n{{anchor|Lyons, Richard}}\n\n===Lyons, Richard Bickerton Pemell===\n(GW:AF)\n\n'''[[Richard Lyons, 1st Viscount Lyons|Richard Lyons]]''' was a British diplomat who was sent to Washington after the Battle of Camp Hill to advise [[Abraham Lincoln]] that the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] and [[Second French Empire|France]] were set to offer recognition to the Confederate States, and that if the U.S. did not do the same, Britain would defend the C.S. by use of its military. Lord Lyons also envisioned a time where both the U.S. and C.S. would \"stand together, [as] a pair of sturdy brothers,\" which never happened at any point of the Confederacy's independence between 1861 and 1944.\n\n===Mosley, Oswald===\n(AE:CCH-AE:VO, SA:ID)\n\n'''[[Oswald Mosley]]''' is the leader of the Silver Shirts, a fascist movement analogous to the [[British Union of Fascists]] (Turtledove conflates two OTL movements: Mosley's historical BUF, also known as the Blackshirts; and the [[Silver Legion of America|Silver Shirts]], an American fascist group linked to [[Bruno Hauptmann]] and the [[Lindbergh kidnapping|Lindbergh Baby case]]). Mosley and several members of the Union gain seats in the British parliament, creating an influential minority. In an attempt to stifle them, the Conservative Party formed a coalition with the Silver Shirts. However, this actually gave more power to the Silver Shirts. The fact that the Conservatives under the leadership of [[Winston Churchill]] had taken a revanchist just insured that the coalition left both parties indistinguishable. Churchill named Mosley [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] to mollify the Silver Shirts. During the later conflict with [[German Empire|Germany]] in 1941, Mosley was also given a position as Minister of War.\n\nShortly after Germans shot down a British plane carrying the second British superbomb in Belgium in 1944, he was ousted as Chancellor of the Exchequer in a non-confidence vote.\n\n===Victoria===\n(HFR)\n\nAs in our timeline, '''[[Queen Victoria|Victoria]]''' was the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Queen]] of the United Kingdom and the [[British Empire]] from 1837 until her death in 1901.\n\nDuring her reign, Victoria's Empire intervened twice in North America within 20 years. The first time was in 1862 after the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]] destroyed the [[Army of the Potomac]] and occupied [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], the [[British Empire]] (along with [[Second French Empire|France]]) extended diplomatic recognition to the [[Confederate States]], ending the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]]. The second time was in 1881 when the British Empire once again sided with the Confederacy and [[French Third Republic|France]] against the United States during the [[Second Mexican War]], after both a promise from the Confederacy to [[manumit]] their [[slaves]], and in response to the aggressive behavior from the United States.\n\n===Wilson, Horace===\n(SA:ID)\n\n'''[[Horace Wilson (civil servant)|Horace Wilson]]''' became the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] in 1944 in the wake of the ouster of [[Winston Churchill]] in a no-confidence vote. His first act as Prime Minister was to ask [[German Empire|Germany]] for a cease-fire.\n\n==France==\n\n===Duchamp, Marcel===\n(GW:AF)\n\n'''[[Marcel Duchamp]]''', in this timeline, is still a famous French artist, but this time his appeal in North America is limited to the upper-crust of the Confederacy. He tried to have an affair with [[Anne Colleton]], who exhibited some of his works at Marshlands [[plantations in the American South|Plantation]]. His works were all removed before [[Marxist]] rebel Cassius and his gang burned the mansion, and Cassius regretted not being able to destroy any Duchamp paintings, which he saw as eyesores.\n\n===Foch, Ferdinand===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[Ferdinand Foch]]''' is a major, the [[Third French Republic|French]] Military Attach\u00e9 to [[Washington, DC]], at the onset of the Second Mexican War. With his [[German Empire|German]] opposite number [[Alfred von Schlieffen]], and an unnamed British army captain, he accompanies [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Hannibal Hamlin]] and Captain Saul Berryman ([[U.S. Army]]) under a flag of truce to the [[Long Bridge (Potomac River)|Long Bridge]] outside Washington D.C. The truce, called by [[C.S. President]] [[James Longstreet]] and C.S. General [[Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson]], is designed to declare Washington D.C. an [[open city]], sparing its destruction.  The Confederate proposal is rejected by Berryman, under the authority of U.S. Commanding General [[William Rosecrans]].  The French and British are declared ''[[personae non gratae]]'' and asked to leave the United States.\n\n===Napoleon III===\n(HFR and GW:AF)\n\n'''[[Napoleon III]]''' installed [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] as the [[Emperor of Mexico]] in the 1860s, a move opposed by the United States under the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. His government was hostile to the United States, and in late 1862, during the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]], despite opposition to slavery, Napoleon III extended diplomatic recognition to the [[Confederate States]] and supported [[British Military]] protection over that country, thus beginning an alliance between France and the CS that would continue through the [[Settling Accounts|Second Great War]] over eighty years later. This eventually turned out to have been a major strategic blunder for which France paid a heavy price, since it threw the United States into the arms of [[German Empire|Germany]] in a rival alliance which triumphed in both the [[Great War (series)|Great War]] and the Second Great War.\n\nUltimately, Napoleon was forced to abdicate in 1870 during the disastrous [[Franco-Prussian War]]. He was also the last [[Monarchy of France|Monarch of France]] until King Charles XI under the [[Action Francaise]] party restored the monarchy around 1930.\n\n==Germany==\n\n===Einstein, Albert===\n(SA:DE)\n\n'''[[Albert Einstein]]''' is a German physicist who was believed to have been working on an [[atomic bomb]] project in Europe. Along with several other leading German and Austro-Hungarian physicists, Einstein disappeared from public view in 1942. Not long afterwards, the United States, along with [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], were suspected of beginning atomic bomb programs. Since in this world Germany never became [[Nazi]] and there were no persecutions of [[Jews]], he has no problem in contributing to the German war effort, especially as the war begins with Germany being attacked and invaded.\n\n===Guderian, Heinz===\n(GW:WH, AE:CCH)\n\nCaptain '''[[Heinz Guderian]]''' of the German Imperial Army was an observer attached to Irving Morrell's unit during the 1916 campaign in the [[Canadian Rockies]].  He expressed a more strategic view of the fighting than Major [[Eduard Dietl]], noting that fighting is done for a purpose.  He then displays his great insight into warfare by adding that the point of battle is to get behind the enemy and \"smash him up\".  (In our timeline, Guderian was one of the masterminds of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]'s [[Blitzkrieg]] tactics, in which the main goal is indeed to get behind the enemy and attack where the enemy is more vulnerable.)  Due to a desire to stay in the field rather than return to a desk position, Guderian stays with Morrell after Major Dietl returns to Austria, and accompanies him back to [[Philadelphia]], during which they meet Luther Bliss and the new Lieutenant Governor of [[Kentucky]].  Guderian makes another appearance, now as a [[lieutenant colonel]], in occupied Canada in 1926, when he shows up in [[Kamloops, British Columbia]], and asks Colonel Morrell for a tour of western Canada.  He is accompanied by his [[aide-de-camp]] Sergeant [[Adolf Hitler]], whose [[anti-Semitic]] views he does not care for.\n\n{{anchor|Adolf Hitler}}\n\n===Hitler, Adolf===\n(AE:CCH)\n\nBecause of the [[German Empire]]'s victory in this world, '''[[Adolf Hitler]]''' is a sergeant in the German Army. He holds the [[Iron Cross]], First Class. Morrell met him once as an orderly to Colonel [[Heinz Guderian]], who was on an inspection tour in [[Kamloops, British Columbia]], an occupied territory of the United States. Morrell thought that he was very much like [[Jake Featherston]], but with a hatred for [[Jews]] and [[Slavs]] rather than [[Africans]]. Hitler is never mentioned by name in CCH, but the author has acknowledged his identity. (See also Turtledove's short story \"Uncle Alf\" in the anthology ''Alternate Generals II'', narrated by a similar version of Hitler.)\n\n===Marx, Karl===\n(HFR-AE:CCH)\n\n'''Karl Marx''' was greatly admired by former [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]]. However, Lincoln did not agree with Marx's belief in violent revolution, and steered the [[Socialist Party of the United States]] towards change through the ballot, rather than the bullet at the party's founding 1882.\n\nIn the [[Confederate States]], black revolutionaries embraced Marx's call for revolution, staging a revolt during the early years of the [[Great War (series)|Great War]]. While various socialist republics such as the Black Belt Socialist Republic and Congaree Socialist Republic were created, the uprisings were crushed by the C.S. in short order.\n\n===Schacht, Hjalmar===\n\n'''[[Hjalmar Schacht]]''' is mentioned as being the German Ambassador to the United States on the eve of North American hostilities during the Second Great War.\n\n===von Schlieffen, Alfred===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[Alfred von Schlieffen]]''' was a [[colonel]] in the German [[army]] working as a military [[attach\u00e9]] before and during the Second Mexican War at the German embassy in the United States. His study of [[Robert E. Lee]]'s encirclement of [[Washington, D.C.]] is said to be the inspiration for the [[Schlieffen Plan]] of [[World War I]].\n\n===von Schl\u00f6zer, Kurd===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[Kurd von Schl\u00f6zer]]''' remained the [[German Empire]]'s ambassador to the United States as in our timeline. After U.S. President Blaine sued for peace during the Second Mexican War, Schl\u00f6zer and the German military attach\u00e9 Alfred von Schlieffen first brought up the idea of an alliance between the United States and the German Empire as a counterpart to the alliance between the United Kingdom, France and the [[Confederate States]], thus forming the foundations for the [[Central Powers]] and breaking the United States' policy of nonintervention in European affairs.\n\n===Wilhelm II, Kaiser===\n(GW:AF-AE:VO)\n\nKaiser '''[[Wilhelm II]]''' was the German Emperor and one of the main allies of the United States in World War I. \"Kaiser Bill\" was a popular character in the U.S. Many men wore a \"Kaiser Bill\" mustache in imitation of him. He lived until 1941 (as he did in our timeline), where his death and his son's coming to the throne and refusal to give France its [[Alsace-Lorraine|lost territory]] back started the Second Great War. He was the father of Kaiser [[Crown Prince Wilhelm of Germany|Friedrich Wilhelm V]].\n\n===Wilhelm III, Kaiser===\n(AE:VO, SA:RE-ID)\n\n[[Crown Prince Wilhelm of Germany|'''Friedrich Wilhelm''']], Crown Prince of Germany, became Kaiser of the German Empire in 1941, upon the death of his father, [[Wilhelm II]]. He refused to return Alsace-Lorraine to the newly revived Kingdom of France and their British allies, which precipitated the Second Great War in Europe. He authorised the destruction of several targets with superbombs, including [[Petrograd]], [[Paris]] as well as [[London]], [[Norwich]] and [[Brighton]] in a deadly triple strike that crippled Britain into defeat. After the war, he entered into a treaty with the new US President [[Thomas E. Dewey]] to police the world and prevent further development of superbombs.\n\nThis character may be the center of a substantial mistake on Turtledove's part. Upon his ascension at the end of [[American Empire: The Victorious Opposition|''The Victorious Opposition'']], he is announced as \"Friedrich I of Germany and Friedrich Wilhelm V of Prussia.\" If this character is indeed the historical figure Wilhelm, Crown Prince of Germany, then he would have reigned as Wilhelm III. While the Crown Prince's first name was Friedrich, even if he chose to call himself that upon his ascension, or, if the character is meant to be the fictional son of Wilhelm II of Germany, he could not have been Friedrich I, but would in fact have been Friedrich IV. There also does not appear to have been a tradition of the German Emperor using a different name in his role as King of Prussia.\n\nAs Turtledove only refers to this character as 'the Kaiser' in the ''Settling Accounts'' series, there are no additional clues available to the reader as to the character's identity.\n\n==Austria-Hungary==\n\n===Charles I of Austria===\n(SA:G)\n\n'''[[Charles I of Austria]]''' still holds the throne of [[Austria-Hungary]] well into the [[Settling Accounts|Second Great War]]. In 1943, he and [[Tsar]] [[Michael II of Russia]] trade public insults as to whose country [[God]] hates more.\n\nTurtledove does not spend much time on the monarchy of Austria-Hungary. Indeed, the only reference to Charles is the one described above. But with Austria victorious at the end of [[World War I]], Charles would not have abdicated as in real history, and so would have avoided dying of [[pneumonia]] in 1922 while living in [[Portugal]].\n\n===Dietl, Eduard===\n(GW:WH)\n\nMajor '''[[Eduard Dietl]]''' of the [[Austro-Hungarian]] army was an observer attached to [[Irving Morrell|Irving Morrell's]] unit during the 1916 campaign in the [[Canadian Rockies]]. While Turtledove made him an Austro-Hungarian officer, real-life Dietl was a member of the German army.\n\n===Ferdinand, Franz===\n(GW:AF)\n\n'''Archduke Franz Ferdinand''' and his wife [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg|Duchess Sophie]] through [[Sarajevo]] were [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|blown up by an assassin's bomb]] on June 28, 1914. In real history, the Archduke and his wife were assassinated on the same date, but by gunshot after failed attempts to throw bombs into their car. After the assassination, Austria-Hungary issued a number of ultimata against [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], which was supported by [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. Austria-Hungary was in turn supported by [[German Empire|Germany]] and the [[United States]]. Russia invoked its alliances with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[French Third Republic|France]], and the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]], and the [[Great War (series)|Great War]] began.\n\nFranz Ferdinand's death inspired [[Arthur McGregor]]'s last failed attempt to assassinate [[George Custer|General George Armstrong Custer]] in 1922.\n\n===Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg===\n(GW:AF)\n\n'''Duchess Sophie''' and her husband Archduke Franz Ferdinand were [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|killed when a bomb was thrown into their car and exploded]], as they rode through the streets of [[Sarajevo]] on 28 June 28, 1914. This act helped to spark the [[Great War (series)|Great War]].\n\n==Denmark==\n\n===Bohr, Niels===\n\nThere is no mention of Denmark taking any part in either of the Great Wars, and it seems to have succeeded in maintaining its neutrality. However, [[Niels Bohr]] is mentioned as having been persuaded by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] to come over to [[German Empire|Germany]] and take part in its [[atomic weapons]] program.\n\n==Russia==\n\n===Michael II, Tsar===\n(AE:VO-SA:RE, SA:ID)\n\n'''[[Michael Alexandrovich]]''' is the Grand Duke (and later [[Emperor]]) of [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. With the [[Russian Revolution|Red Russian Revolt]] smashed, and the tsarist government still in control of a post-Great War Russia, \"Grand Duke Michael\" took the throne as Michael II. He joined [[Settling Accounts|Second Great War]] to help his allies in 1941 to wage war against the [[Central Powers]]. He condemned the [[German Empire|German]] [[atomic bomb]] attack on [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]], the city of which he had escaped prior to the attack, but later was forced to request an armistice from Germany and to relinquish the throne.\n\n===Molotov, Vyacheslav (\"The Hammer\")===\n(AE:CCH)\n\nAlso known as \"The Hammer\", this is '''[[Vyacheslav Molotov]]''' from our world, another Red holdout (in the failed rebellion) in the [[Volga]] area, trying to defeat the Tsarist forces. By 1941, the Tsarist forces have all but defeated the Red Russians.\n\n===Nicholas II, Tsar===\n(GW:AF - GW:B, AE:VO)\n\nIn 1914, when [[Austria-Hungary]] issued a number of ultimata to [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] following the assassination of Franz Ferdinand by a Serb in Sarajevo, '''[[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]''' promised to support the Serbs should they refuse the ultimata. They did, and Russia declared war on Austria-Hungary, which had declared war on Serbia. The Great War followed.\n\nIn 1917, Nicholas found himself facing a [[Russian Revolution|Red revolution]], followed by a protracted [[Russian Civil War|civil war]], which resulted in Russia backing out of the Great War. Ultimately, Nicholas and his supporters triumphed, and Nicholas remained emperor for the remainder of the 1920s. The destruction resulting from the wars left Russia in such a poor state that in 1929 she was forced to suspend payment of a loan to Austria-Hungary. This caused a chain effect that led in turn to the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|worldwide stock market]] crash of that year.\n\nNicholas was succeeded as Tsar by his younger brother [[Michael Alexandrovich|Michael II]] by the early 1930s.\n\n===Stalin, Joseph===\n(AE:CCH)\n\n'''[[Joseph Stalin]]''' is nicknamed \"The Man of Steel\" in this world. The Red Revolution following the Great War failed and Stalin and the \"Hammer\" ([[Vyacheslav Molotov]]) became holdouts in the Volga area near the city of [[Volgograd|Tsaritsyn]] which in our timeline was renamed by him as Stalingrad.\n\n==Ottoman Empire==\n\n===Abdul Mejid II===\n(AE:CCH)\n\n'''[[Abdul Mejid II]]''' became the [[Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] sometime after the Great War. He was responsible for continuing the [[Armenian genocide]] through the 1920s. Despite protests from the United States and [[German Empire|Germany]], the Sultan continued the killings until there were few remaining Armenians left in Turkey.\n\n==Ireland==\n\n===Collins, Michael===\n(AE:BI)\n\nGeneral '''[[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]]''' led a rebellion against the [[British Empire]] during the Great War, supported by the United States and Germany, and became first president of the [[Republic of Ireland]] when this country achieved independence shortly after the war ended. In the early 1920s Collins led the Irish Army against a pro-British Protestant uprising in [[Ulster]] and suppressed it with the help of American and German warships.\n\n==Italy and Vatican City==\n\n===Mussolini, Benito===\n(SA:RE)\n\nAlthough not mentioned by name, Flora Blackford tries to recall the Italian politician who had pledged to make all the trains in his country run on time, but had little public support. The real '''[[Benito Mussolini]]''' claimed to have done this during his rule of [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Italy]]; actually, improvements in the train system predated Mussolini, and the trains were as unpunctual as before.\n\n===Pope Pius XII===\n(SA:G)\n\n'''[[Pope Pius XII|Pius XII]]''' was Pope in this timeline as well as ours. He was criticized for not condemning the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] [[genocide]] of [[Armenians]] or the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] [[pogroms]] against [[Jews]], and it appeared that he likewise did not care about the Freedom Party's killing of the black population of the Confederate States. One character observes that Pius would have spoken out against human rights violations if the group being persecuted consisted mainly of [[Catholic Church|Catholics]]. (Yet this argument is faulty, as the killings were also affecting Catholic Haiti.) The criticism of Pius' failure to condemn human rights violations in this timeline echoes the widely held belief that [[Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust|Pope Pius XII didn't condemn the Holocaust]] in ours.\n\nGiven the passage of eight decades between the point of divergence and this part of the story, there's no guarantee that this Pius XII is Eugenio Pacelli, the man who used that numeral in our timeline. For most of history, Popes simply took their regnal names from a fairly short list. However, the plethora of other historical figures in the series suggests that he is the same.\n\n==Spain==\n\n===Alfonso XIII===\n(AE:VO)\n\n'''[[Alfonso XIII]]''' continues to reign as the King of Spain during the [[Spanish Civil War]], which is fought between the Monarchists (supported by [[German Empire|Germany]]) and the Republicans (supported by Great Britain and the Kingdom of France), as mentioned by Ernest Hemmingway when he discussed with Sylvia Enos the possibility of volunteering to fight in it. Alfonso's reign presumably continued following the Monarchist victory in the conflict.\n\nAlfonso's extended reign may be the result of the Central Powers victory in the Great War which prohibited the rise of [[National Fascist Party|Fascism]], [[National Socialist Workers' Party of Germany|Nazism]] and [[Bolshevism]] and preserved the conservative monarchies of Germany, Austria-Hungary, Turkey and Russia. However, no background is given regarding the civil war.\n\n==Mentioned Historical Characters from Before the [[point of divergence|Change]]==\n\n===Adams, John===\n'''[[John Adams]]''' served as the second [[President of the United States]]. After the [[How Few Remain|War of Secession]], he and the other Northerner [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] such as [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]] were treated more favorably.\n\nDuring the 1900s, Adams's portrait was used on the [[United States five-dollar bill|five dollar bill]].\n\n===Brown, John===\n(AE:BI)\n\nFollowing the U.S. defeat in the Second Mexican War, '''[[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]''' became a national hero. He was not seen so after the War of Secession. Many towns raised memorials to John Brown because of his attacks on the 'slavocrats' in [[Virginia]] (\"He saw the coiled serpent and attacked it!\"), particularly in [[Kansas]].\n\n===Calhoun, John Caldwell===\n(GW:AF) (SA:G)\n\nAlthough '''[[John C. Calhoun]]''' died over a decade before the Confederate States was created by the secession of eleven US states in 1860\u201361, the secession of the CS's founding states was a direct descendant of his nullification doctrine, and Calhoun was therefore seen as a founding father of the Confederacy along with [[Jefferson Davis]], [[Robert E. Lee]], and even [[George Washington]]. His picture appeared on the [[Confederate States dollar|Confederate dollar bill]], for example. Naturally, the U.S. felt differently about Calhoun.\n\nThe towns of [[Calhoun, Kentucky]] and [[Calhoun, Georgia]] were named in Calhoun's honor in this timeline. (In our timeline, only the Georgia town was unquestionably named in honor of Calhoun. The Kentucky town [[Calhoun, Kentucky#History|had several names]] before being incorporated in 1852, after Calhoun's OTL death in 1850, as ''Calhoon'', honoring Kentucky congressman [[John Calhoon]]. There is no historic record that definitively states whether the later spelling change to \"Calhoun\" was specifically in honor of John C. Calhoun.)\n\n===Franklin, Benjamin===\nAs a [[Pennsylvania|Pennsylvanian man]], '''[[Benjamin Franklin]]''' remained a favorite Founding Father after the War of Secession along with [[John Adams]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]]. A profile of Franklin's face was printed on stamps issued in American Occupied Canada after the [[Great War (Harry Turtledove)|Great War]].\n\n[[Flora Hamburger]] once quoted Franklin's warning \"Those who would trade essential liberty for a little temporary security deserve neither liberty nor security\" in a floor debate in the House of Representatives\u2014which incidentally met in [[Independence Hall]].\n\nFormer president [[Abraham Lincoln]] also quoted Franklin to his host when he visited [[Salt Lake City]] in 1881.\n\n===Jefferson, Thomas===\n'''[[Thomas Jefferson]]''' was the third [[President of the United States]]. Following the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]], Thomas Jefferson's status as a [[Virginia]]n (and more substantively, his insistence on a weak central government) tarnished his memory considerably in the United States. Northern Founding Fathers such as [[John Adams]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], and [[Alexander Hamilton]] were viewed much more favorably.\n\n===Madison, James===\n(SA:ID)\n\nDespite his contributions to the [[Federalist paper]]s with [[Alexander Hamilton]], '''[[James Madison]]''' later developed anti-Federalist sentiments and allied himself with Hamilton's archrival, [[Thomas Jefferson]]. For this reason as well as his Virginian heritage, Madison was generally remembered unfavorably in the version of US history advanced under the Remembrance tradition.\n\nIn 1944, many in the U.S. presumed that Cassius Madison, the man who killed [[Jake Featherston]], had taken his surname to honor the fourth President. In fact Cassius had taken the surname from the [[Madison, Georgia|Georgia town]] nearest to where he'd gunned Featherston down. He had never even heard of President Madison before his tour of the U.S.\n\n===Monroe, James===\n(HFR)\n\nDespite being from [[Virginia]] (a trait which other presidents and [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] such as [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]], and even [[George Washington]] to being remembered in a mixed or negative light by US historians after the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]]), '''[[James Monroe]]''' was looked on kindly in US history books for his attempt to promote U.S. security and international prestige with the [[Monroe Doctrine]]\u2014a doctrine which was eviscerated in 1862 when, thanks to the Confederate States, the U.S. was powerless to prevent [[Second French Empire|France]] from installing [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] as the [[Emperor of Mexico]].\n\n===Napoleon===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[Napoleon]]''' had been a military genius, achieving an almost mythological stature in the eyes of the world. All those who were masters on the battlefield were often compared to him. He was also an uncle of [[Napoleon III]] who, in turn, was the Emperor of [[Second French Empire|France]] from 1852 to 1870.\n\nOnly in [[German Empire|Germany]] was he not admired as his victory over [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] was remembered. In the aftermath of France's defeat in the [[Great War (Harry Turtledove)|Great War]], this made him even more of a hero to the people of France.\n\nDuring his youth, US President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] counted Napoleon as one of his personal heroes, along with [[George Washington]] and [[Zachary Taylor]].\n\nIn 1881, [[Alfred von Schlieffen]] noted that Kaiser [[Wilhelm I]] was one of the last surviving men to have fought under Napoleon during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\n===Polk, James Knox===\n(SA:ID)\n\n'''[[James Knox Polk]]''' had served as the eleventh President of the United States. He was born in what became [[Pineville, North Carolina]]. A monument erected on the spot of his birth was site of the 1944 meeting between U.S. General [[Irving Morrell]] and [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate president]] [[Don Partridge]] at which Partridge signed away Confederate sovereignty and ended the [[Settling Accounts|Second Great War]]. Both men deemed it a fit location for the meeting because Polk had been president before the United States was divided by the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]].\n\n===Taylor, Zachary===\n(HFR)\n\nDespite his southern roots, '''[[Zachary Taylor]]''' was appreciated in the United States for his military success during the [[Mexican\u2013American War|First Mexican War]] (the last which the United States would see until the [[Great War (series)|Great War]]).\n\nIn his youth, Theodore Roosevelt was a great admirer of Taylor's, viewing him as a conqueror and leader ranking with [[George Washington]] and [[Napoleon]].\n\n===Vegetius===\n(GW:AF)\n\nMajor General William Dudley Foulke gives a copy of his translation of the writings of '''[[Vegetius]]''' to Major Irving Morrell when General Foulke detaches Morrell for assignment to the U.S. General Staff.\n\n===Washington, George===\nAs a military hero and the first President of the United States, '''[[George Washington]]''' was universally revered as a major Founding Father and one of the most memorable presidents in American history. Also after it broke into two mutually antagonistic nations, U.S. historians continued to so regard Washington, alongside Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt as the most memorable of presidents.\n\nBefore 1920, the Confederacy esteemed Washington as a Founding Father, but generally preferred their own founding fathers such as [[John C. Calhoun]], [[Jefferson Davis]], and [[Robert E. Lee]]. In 1914, then-President [[Woodrow Wilson]] invoked George Washington in his speech asking for Congress for a declaration of war against the U.S. while speaking in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].\n\nIn the Union, however, Washington was remembered on mixed terms. The general public did not always remember kindly. Washington came from [[Virginia]], and after the War of Secession his popularity in the U.S. suffered because of it - as did that of Thomas Jefferson and [[James Madison]]. Northern people in general preferred to remember Northern Founding Fathers such as John Adams, Alexander Hamilton and Benjamin Franklin (whose picture appeared on stamps issued by the U.S. occupation authorities in Canada). Despite this, the U.S. Government would rebuild the [[Washington Monument]] after it was destroyed during the [[Great War (Harry Turtledove)|Great War]]. As a young man, Theodore Roosevelt admired Washington as a great leader along with [[Zachary Taylor]] and [[Napoleon]].\n\nThe Freedom Party in its earliest phase, while still under [[Anthony Dresser]], used George Washington's picture as an emblem, with the slogan \"We need a New Revolution\". [[Jake Featherston]], who considered Washington to have \"sold out the South to the damnyankees\" stopped that custom when he took over the party. Many Confederates did view Washington with some suspicion in the years after the Great War, but still thought of him as a Virginian first, and President of the United States second. Washington University in [[Lexington, Virginia]], home of the Confederacy's effort to build a [[Nuclear bomb|superbomb]], retained its name, and the statue of Washington that stood in Richmond survived both Great Wars.\n\n===Webster, Daniel===\n(GW:B)\n\nAs a northern abolitionist, '''[[Daniel Webster]]''' became a hero to the United States during the Remembrance era between the [[Second Mexican War]] and the [[Great War (series)|Great War]]. His image was on the [[Quarter (United States coin)|U.S. quarter]]. In the Confederate States, he was vilified for thwarting the interests of the ante-bellum South.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Fictional characters in the Southern Victory Series]]\n* [[Institutions in the Southern Victory Series]]\n* [[Southern Victory Series]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Harry Turtledove}}\n\n[[Category:Alternate history characters]]\n[[Category:Southern Victory Series]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Humphrey Bogart]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of John Wilkes Booth]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Mark Twain]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of George Armstrong Custer]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Calvin Coolidge]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Clarence Darrow]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Frederick Douglass]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of W.

The [[point of divergence]] involves [[Confederate States of America]] winning the [[American Civil War]] and becoming an independent nation. The series covers events from 1862 to 1945 and features dozens of characters, some of whom were historical figures.\n\n==Books in the series==\n* ''[[How Few Remain]]'' (1997) \u2013 ''HFR''\n* ''[[The Great War: American Front]]'' (1998) \u2013 ''GW:AF''\n* ''[[The Great War: Walk in Hell]]'' (1999) \u2013 ''GW:WH''\n* ''[[The Great War: Breakthroughs]]'' (2000) \u2013 ''GW:B''\n* ''[[American Empire: Blood and Iron]]'' (2001) \u2013 ''AE:BI''\n* ''[[American Empire: The Center Cannot Hold]]'' (2002) \u2013 ''AE:CCH''\n* ''[[American Empire: The Victorious Opposition]]'' (2003) \u2013 ''AE:VO''\n* ''[[Settling Accounts: Return Engagement]]'' (2004) \u2013 ''SA:RE''\n* ''[[Settling Accounts: Drive to the East]]'' (2005) \u2013 ''SA:DE''\n* ''[[Settling Accounts: The Grapple]]'' (2006) \u2013 ''SA:G''\n* ''[[Settling Accounts: In at the Death]]'' (2007) \u2013 ''SA:ID''\n\n==United States==\n\n===Alcott, Louisa May===\n(HFR)\n\nRather than ''[[Little Women]]'', set in a North that was winning the war, '''[[Louisa May Alcott]]''' wrote ''After the War was Lost''.\n\n===Ballou, Charles===\n(AE:VO)\n\n'''[[Charles Clarendon Ballou]]''' is a [[brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in the [[United States Army]], and the base commandant of [[Fort Leavenworth]] when Irving Morrell is posted there in the mid-1930s. It is Ballou who reintroduces [[colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Morrell to Brigadier General Daniel MacArthur, and who reassigns Morrell to be armor commander of MacArthur's occupying force in Houston.\n\n===Baum, L. Frank===\n(GW:AF, AE:VO)\n\nIn a rather odd move on Turtledove's part, '''[[L. Frank Baum]]''' is introduced as an American fighter pilot early in the Great War, this despite the fact that Baum was aged 58 in 1914. (Perhaps there is confusion with his son [[Frank Joslyn Baum]]) Somewhere along the line, Baum still becomes a children's author. Only his book ''[[Queen Zixi of Ix]]'' is mentioned by name, but because the book is an offshoot of ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]'' craze, we can assume he still wrote his most famous book. (However, ''The Wizard of Oz'' was inspired by [[architectural]] exhibits at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World's Fair]] of 1893, which is unlikely to have happened in this timeline, making this plot element questionable.)\n\n===Bernstein, Carl===\n(SA:G)\n\nSergeant '''[[Carl Bernstein]]''' is in charge of a [[U.S. Army]] [[counterintelligence]] squadron that specializes in detecting [[wiretaps]]. He is sent to check [[Congresswoman]] Flora Blackford's office for bugs. Among his team are a 'Bob' (possibly [[Bob Woodward]] or [[H. R. Haldeman]]) and 'Dick' (almost certainly [[Richard Nixon]]). This is an obvious [[anachronism]] for the sake of a laugh, as the Bernstein of our timeline was not born until 1944.\n\n===Blaine, James G.===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[James G. Blaine]]''' was the second and last [[Republican Party (USA)|Republican]] [[president of the United States]]. Elected over Democratic incumbent [[Samuel J. Tilden]] in [[1880 United States presidential election|1880]], he was also known as the only other president to start a war (over the [[Confederate States of America|CSA]]'s purchase of the states of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] and [[Sonora]], giving the Confederacy a [[Pacific]] port) and to lose the war as well. At the end of The [[Second Mexican War]], Blaine started the U.S. tradition of Remembrance Day and also started the alliance with the [[German Empire]], which developed into The [[Central Powers]] of the Great War. As a result of the Us' defeat in the Second Mexican War, Blaine would end up losing the [[1884 United States presidential election|1884 presidential election]] in a landslide.\n\n===Bogart, Humphrey===\n(SA:DE)\n\nIn this timeline, '''[[Humphrey Bogart]]''' still became a movie actor. He starred in the movie ''The Maltese Elephant'', an analog to our timeline's ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (''The Maltese Elephant'' is also the name of a short story in Harry Turtledove's short story collection ''[[Counting Up, Counting Down]]''). Armstrong Grimes thought of Bogart when he learned that his aunt Clara was marrying someone named Humphrey Baxter.\n\n===Booth, John Wilkes===\n(HFR)\n\nWith the South having gained its independence, '''[[John Wilkes Booth]]''' has nothing to be [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|homicidally angry]] about. He and his elder brother '''[[Edwin Booth]]''' remain popular stage actors in both the U.S. and [[Confederate States of America|CSA]] into the 1880s.\n\n===Borah, William Edgar===\n(AE:VO)\n\n[[Herbert Hoover]]'s running mate (Hoover became president after president-elect [[Calvin Coolidge]] died and did not have a vice president) in the [[1936 United States presidential election|1936 election]], '''[[William Edgar Borah]]''' had even some of the most loyal Democrats saying that his vice presidential opponent, [[Fictional characters in the Southern Victory Series#Charles W. La Follette|Charles W. La Follette]], would make a better VP.\n\n===Brown, Mordecai===\n(GW:WH, AE:VO)\n\nKnown only as \"Mordecai\" in the series, '''[[Mordecai Brown|Mordecai \"Three Finger\" Brown]]''', instead of becoming a [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] pitcher, was a crewman on the ''[[United States Ship|USS]] Dakota'' during the [[Great War (Harry Turtledove)|Great War]]. [[Sam Carsten]] noted how Mordecai could work as if he had ten fingers, instead of eight, which was the result of a childhood accident (also suffered by the Brown of our timeline). By 1934, Mordecai was the foreman at a [[Los Angeles]] construction company; one of his employees was Chester Martin, who had moved from [[Toledo, Ohio]] as a result of the [[Great Depression|Business Collapse]]. By the late 1930s, however, Mordecai lost many of his workers, including Martin, as a result of a strike.\n\n===Butler, Benjamin Franklin===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Franklin Butler]]''' had been a politician of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] when the War of Secession began in 1861. He left the party and joined the [[United States Army|Army]] to fight the war. He was best known for commanding the occupation garrison of [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], a post in which he was most thoroughly despised by the locals. When the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] was defeated, Butler was forced to flee New Orleans for his life; the Confederate authorities had promised to hang him for war crimes without a trial. In the aftermath of the war, Butler left the army and returned to politics, this time joining the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] as a hard liner.\n\nWhen the [[Second Mexican War]] began in 1881, Butler was more than enthusiastic to fight it, but as the war progressed and turned against the Union, Butler grew bitter and openly critical of US President [[James G. Blaine]].\n\nIn 1882, Butler was one of several prominent leaders of the Republican Party to attend a convention called by former president [[Abraham Lincoln]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. He resisted Lincoln's proposal to replace hostility toward the Confederate States with workers' rights as the central plank of the party's platform. Butler steadfastly refused to drop his Anti-Confederate policies. He blamed the loss of the war on the social and moral weakness of the country, and that it needed to rebuild itself into a more authoritarian nation if the nation was to ever be triumphant over the Rebels. When he realized he wasn't going to get his way, Butler walked out of the meeting. In the chaos that followed, the Republican Party split, with the Liberal faction joining the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]], while Butler left the Republican Party and rejoined the Democrats, taking all of the Conservative hardliners with him.\n\nAs a result of Butler's actions, the Democratic Party would be pushed further to the right on the political spectrum and would also cause a majority of the party to adopt a hard line foreign policy and the gearing of American society to [[American nationalism|nationalism]] and [[revanchism]].\n\n===Cannon, Clarence===\n(AE:VO)\n\nA [[Socialist Party (USA)|Socialist]] Congressman from [[Missouri]], '''[[Clarence Cannon]]''' becomes [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] during the [[Alfred Emanuel Smith|Smith]] Administration.\n\n===Chaney, Lon===\n(SA:G)\n\n'''[[Lon Chaney, Sr.]]''' appeared as a silent movie star in ''The Phantom of the Catacombs'', which is probably an analog of our timeline's ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]].''\n\n===Clemens, Samuel===\n(Viewpoint Character HFR; SA:DE)\n\n'''[[Samuel Clemens]]''' does not become famous in this timeline as the novelist, travel writer, and essayist [[Mark Twain]]. Here he has lost his family's valuable land in [[Tennessee]] (as it is now part of an enemy nation). He settles down with his family in [[San Francisco]] where he becomes the editor of the ''San Francisco Morning Call'', and is known for his very sarcastic war editorials in the 1880s during the [[Second Mexican War]]. His home is burned by [[British army|British soldiers]] on their way to steal from the [[San Francisco Mint]], and he is briefly suspected of being an enemy agent until Colonel [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] meets with him and determines he is safe. His journalistic work keeps him occupied full-time and he never takes up writing books.\n\nClemens had a different wife and children in this world than he had in our timeline. Unlike our world, one of his offspring grew up to be a famous [[journalist]]: Ophelia Clemens. It was never revealed whatever happened to his other child, Orion.\n\n===Coolidge, Calvin===\n(AE:BI-AE:CCH)\n\n'''[[Calvin Coolidge]]''' was the Democratic politician in the early 1900s. He served as the [[governor of Massachusetts]] in the 1910s and 20s, and was elected to the presidency in [[1932 United States presidential election|1932]]. He is the only man elected [[President of the United States]] never to be inaugurated.\n\nA veteran of the [[Great War (Harry Turtledove)|Great War]], Coolidge rose to prominence during his tenure as the governor of Massachusetts during the 1920s. In [[1928 United States presidential election|1928]], he was the Democratic Party's nominee for president. However, as the United States had been experiencing an economic boom under the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] President [[Upton Sinclair]], Coolidge was readily portrayed as another regressive Democrat. Despite Coolidge's promises to keep the [[Confederate States]] in check, his lack of accomplishment outside of [[Massachusetts]], worked against him. Although he carried all of the [[New England]] states (including his home and birth states of Massachusetts and [[Vermont]]), [[Kansas]], [[Kentucky]], [[Montana]], [[Idaho]], [[Nevada]], and [[Texas Panhandle|Houston]], he lost that election narrowly to the incumbent Vice President, Socialist [[Hosea Blackford]]. When Coolidge called Blackford to concede the race, he warned him that a \"[[bull market]] going as high as it is, will fall\". Blackford thought it was just [[:wikt:sour grapes|sour grapes]] and paid no heed. When Coolidge's words [[Stock Market Crash 1929|came true in 1929]] and the Socialists and Blackford were blamed for the crash, he was nominated on the Democratic ticket again in [[1932 United States presidential election|1932]] with [[Herbert Hoover]] as his running mate. He won the 1932 election in a landslide. However, on January 5, 1933, President-elect Coolidge suffered a heart attack while shaving and died, less than a month before he would be inaugurated on February 1. (The Coolidge of our history died on the same date, but after he served as president from 1923 to 1929.) Herbert Hoover took his place as President-elect and would go on to be inaugurated as the thirty first [[President of the United States]] on February 1.\n\n===Curley, Jim===\n(SA:ID)\n\nCongressman '''[[James Michael Curley|Jim Curley]]''' of [[Massachusetts]] was the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party's]] candidate for Vice President in the [[1944 United States presidential election|1944 election]]. [[Flora Hamburger|Flora Hamburger Blackford]] questioned this choice because of his role in the [[Boston]] Socialist political machine, though she figured the [[Kansas City]] Democratic machine was more corrupt. The Socialist ticket of [[Charles M. La Follette|Charles W. La Follete]] and Curley lost to the Democratic ticket of [[Thomas E. Dewey]] and [[Harry S. Truman]].\n\n===Custer, George Armstrong===\n(HFR, GW:AF-AE:CCH)\n\nIn this timeline, '''[[George Custer]]''' was not [[Battle of Little Big Horn|killed fighting Indians in 1876]], as this smaller United States appears to have attempted to salve its wounded national pride following the [[War of Secession]] by unleashing a much larger [[US Army]] upon the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes, thus compressing the conquest of the Great Plains into a much shorter timescale. He served in [[Utah]] and [[Montana]] during the Second Mexican War, where he met [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. His forces helped defeat General [[Charles George Gordon|Charles Gordon]]'s invasion of [[Montana]].  A movement to nominate him to succeed [[James G. Blaine]] as [[US President]] flourished briefly but petered out. In the Great War he was a [[lieutenant general]] in the [[United States Army]] and commanded the First Army forces in [[Tennessee]]. He was personally vain, using peroxide to bleach his grey hair and mustache despite his advanced age. He was concerned about his public image, and was furious when he read the reports on him by [[journalist]] [[Richard Harding Davis]]. As a Great War commander, he was unsuited for [[trench warfare]], insisting on mounting large assaults on enemy lines instead of winning by attrition. However, his strategies were perfectly suited for \"barrels,\" the timeline's term for [[tank]]s. Once they were introduced in force he crafted the \"Barrel Roll Offensive,\" an armored breakthrough which ultimately won the Great War for the U.S.\n\nFollowing the war, Custer was appointed to command the occupation forces in Canada, where he survived several [[assassination]] attempts, ultimately killing the man who had tried so determinedly to kill him. Custer was forced into retirement following the election of [[Upton Sinclair]] as President; Secretary of War [[Norman Mattoon Thomas]] served him the papers. He died in 1930 and was buried next to Theodore Roosevelt near [[Robert E. Lee]]'s house in [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington, West Virginia]], in one of several northern [[Virginia]] counties reassigned to [[West Virginia]] after the Great War. His extraordinarily lengthy career, approximately 60 years in the [[US Army]], is roughly analogous to that of the German general [[Paul von Hindenburg]] in our timeline.\n\n===Custer, Thomas===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[Thomas Custer|Tom Custer]]''', in this timeline, was not killed in 1876 alongside his brother George at [[Battle of the Little Bighorn|Little Big Horn]]. He fought alongside his brother during the Second Mexican War in both [[Utah]] and [[Montana]]. In 1881, Tom was killed during the fighting in Montana; this led to his brother George developing a lifelong hatred of the Canadians.\n\n===Daniels, Josephus===\n(GW:AF-GW:B)\n\nAlthough being of Southern origins, '''[[Josephus Daniels]]''' served as Secretary of the [[U.S. Navy]] during the Great War. A destroyer escort was named after him in the Second Great War.\n\n(It is unknown why he is on the USA's side, and it is commonly believed to be an error on the part of author Harry Turtledove. In actual history, Daniels was born in [[Washington, North Carolina]] to a Unionist family; his father was killed by Confederate artillery in January 1865.<ref>http://www.ncmarkers.com/Markers.aspx?ct=ddl&sp=search&k=Markers&sv=B-24%20-%20JOSEPHUS%20DANIELS{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In the ''Southern Victory'' timeline, it may be presumed that the Daniels family moved North after the Union defeat in 1862.)\n\n===Darrow, Clarence===\n(AE:CCH)\n\nWith no Southern states to [[Scopes Trial|interfere with the teaching of evolution]], '''[[Clarence Darrow]]''' practiced [[criminal law]] in the United States. He was famous enough to convince the State of [[Kentucky]] (and the Kentucky State Police head Luther Bliss) that it was wrong in holding Cincinnatus Driver on trumped-up charges.\n\n===Davis, Richard Harding===\n(GW:AF-GW:WH)\n\n'''[[Richard Harding Davis]]''' was a journalist and war correspondent in this timeline as well as ours. He was famous for coverage of the Hispano-Japanese War of 1905, and was a thorn in the side of General [[George Armstrong Custer]]. He died of a heart attack in 1916 observing the trench fighting in the Great War. (In our timeline, he died in the same year of the same cause, but in [[New York City]] instead of a war zone.)\n\n===Debs, Eugene V.===\n(GW:B-AE:BI)\n\nSenator '''[[Eugene V. Debs]]''' was one of the first Socialists to be elected to Congress after the split of the Republican Party. He was the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] candidate for President in [[1908 United States presidential election|1908]], [[1912 United States presidential election|1912]] and [[1916 United States presidential election|1916]]. He ran unsuccessfully for president against [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in both the 1912 and 1916, and was a strong opponent of U.S. involvement in the [[Great War (Harry Turtledove)|Great War]].\n\n===Dewey, George===\n(GW:AF)\n\n'''[[George Dewey]]''' of [[Vermont]] is the admiral who commands the successful U.S. attack on the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]] early the Great War, in 1914. There are passing similarities between this fictional battle and the real [[Battle of Manila Bay]].\n\nDewey may or may not have commanded the Navy during the Battle of the Three Navies\u2014the commander is never named. If it is not Dewey, it is [[Bradley Fiske]], who evidently succeeded Dewey. Dewey would have been 77 at the time of the Battle, and Fiske was over a decade younger.\n\n===Dewey, Thomas E.===\n(SA:ID)\n\n'''[[Thomas Dewey]]''' was governor of New York when he received the Democratic nomination for President in [[1944 United States presidential election|1944]]. He and his running mate [[Harry S. Truman]] of [[Missouri]] defeat the incumbent [[Fictional characters in the Southern Victory Series#Charles W. La Follette|Charles W. La Follette]]. His victory is partially attributed to pointing out that the CSA was able to regain strength and attack the United States on the watch of three Socialist Presidents (conveniently downplaying Democrat [[Herbert Hoover]], who made no efforts to stop the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]).\n\nAt his inauguration on February 1, 1945, President Dewey pledged to continue US occupation of the CS with the intention of re-integrating the southern states back into the Union, even though over 82 years had passed since the Confederate States had won its independence in the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]] (1861\u20131862) with the support of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and [[Second French Empire|France]]. He pledged to continue La Follette's policy of racial equality in the armed services. Furthermore, he proposed a continued partnership with the United States' traditional ally, the [[German Empire]], to police the world and prevent the spread of superbomb technology to their former enemies, [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. Given that it was widely believed that Dewey would lose the election, the front-page headline of the November 8, 1944 edition of the [[Chicago Tribune]] inaccurately read \"[[Dewey Defeats Truman|La Follette Defeats Dewey]]\". Vice President-elect Truman was photographed holding up a copy of the paper by the media. Dewey was elected at the age of 42, tying the first Socialist president Upton Sinclair (who was elected to the first of two terms in [[1920 United States presidential election|1920]], defeating the Democratic incumbent [[Theodore Roosevelt]]) as the youngest president in US history. He also was the first president born in the 20th century whereas Sinclair was the first born after the War of Secession.\n\nDewey's victory might be intended to parallel [[Clement Attlee]]'s surprising landslide victory over [[Winston Churchill]] at the end of the Second World War in our timeline. His U.S.-German partnership is reminiscent of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[Four Policemen]] idea.\n\n===Douglass, Frederick===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[Frederick Douglass]]''' was still trying to tell the United States of the suffering of the [[African-American]] slaves in the Confederacy twenty years after the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]]. His pleas were heard only by the small minority of freedmen in the USA and a handful of whites. He also, ironically, becomes one of the first people (in his mind) to approve of the \"Revenge\" mindset that the United States picked up in the [[Second Mexican War]] in fighting the [[Confederate States of America|CSA]].\n\n===Fields, W.C.===\n(SA:DE)\n\n'''[[W.C. Fields]]''' still becomes a film comic, and retains his trademark line \"All things considered, I'd rather be in [[Philadelphia]],\" perhaps inspired by the city becoming the de facto capital of the U.S.\n\n===Fiske, Bradley===\n(GW:B)\n\n'''[[Bradley Fiske]]''' is a rear admiral during the Great War. He is the force commander of the U.S. fleet that assists Chile in its war against Argentina in 1917. He appears briefly to congratulate Sam Carsten and Vic Crosetti for tipping off the military to [[Hawaii]]an spy John Liholiho.\n\n===Foulke, William Dudley===\n(HFR, GW:AF)\n\nThis American politician, lawyer, and poet appears at the beginning of ''How Few Remain''. Before the war starts '''[[William Dudley Foulke|William Foulke]]''' is an infantry captain of the United States Army. [[Jeb Stuart]] wonders what a stuck-up young man is doing out west. He reappears in 1915 as Irving Morrell's divisional commander in southeastern Kentucky.\n\n===Foxx, Jimmie===\n(SA:DE)\n\nInstead of becoming a Hall of Fame first baseman, '''[[Jimmie Foxx]]''' was a running back in the U.S. football league. His name was used as a password in Irving Morrell's army to identify Confederate spies.\n\n===Garfield, James===\n(HFR)\n\nSenator '''[[James Garfield]]''' is one of the Republican Party leaders who gather in [[Chicago]] in 1882 to discuss the party's future. He is more conservative than former president [[Abraham Lincoln]] and wishes not to make the party more radical.\n\n===Gehrig, Lou===\n(AE:CCH)\n\n'''[[Lou Gehrig]]''' played professional football in this timeline as a member of the [[Philadelphia]] [[tanks|Barrels]] team. When asked about earning more money than [[US President]] [[Hosea Blackford]], he responded, \"I had a better year than he did,\" echoing [[Babe Ruth]]'s comments about [[Herbert Hoover|President Hoover]] in our timeline.\n\n===Goldwater, Barry===\n(AE:VO)\n\n'''[[Barry Goldwater]]''' was a Democratic Congressman from [[New Mexico]] noted for his [[anti-Mormon]] speeches and rabble rousing during the days and months leading up to Second Great War. (Note that the New Mexico of this timeline included [[Arizona]], home to our timeline's Goldwater.)\n\n===Grant, Ulysses S.===\n(HFR, AE:BI)\n\nGeneral '''[[Ulysses Grant]]''', in the twenty years after the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]], is a broken down, poor man. Known for his victories in a war the United States had few in, he was one of the few people left in the United States who supported the plight of [[African-Americans]] in both North American republics. Grant died from complications from [[alcoholism]].\n\n===Greenberg, Hank===\n(SA:DE)\n\nInstead of becoming a Hall of Fame first baseman for the [[Detroit Tigers]], '''[[Hank Greenberg]]''' was a prominent U.S. running back. His name was used as a code in Irving Morrell's army to prevent Confederate spies from infiltrating U.S. lines.\n\n===Guffey, Joseph===\n(SA:RE)\n\n'''[[Joseph F. Guffey]]''' was the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|U.S. Speaker of the House]] during the Smith and La Follette administrations. When [[Al Smith]] was killed in the Confederate bombing raid of Philadelphia in 1942, Guffey announced the President's death to a joint session of Congress.\n\n===Halsey, William Frederick Jr.===\n(SA:RE)\n\nA Rear Admiral of the Southern Shore Squadron, '''[[Bill Halsey]]''' was part of the MacArthur plan to land and attack at the mouth of the [[James River]] until General Abner Dowling contacted the War Department to stop that plan. From Dowling's statement on him, it seems he is as reckless as MacArthur.\n\n===Hamlin, Hannibal===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[Hannibal Hamlin]]''' was [[Vice President of the United States]] under President [[Abraham Lincoln]] from 1861 to 1865. In the [[1864 United States presidential election|1864 election]], and in the aftermath of the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]], he and Lincoln were defeated in a landslide. Hamlin would later serve as [[United States Secretary of State|secretary of state]] in the [[James G. Blaine]] administration and is chosen to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflict leading up to the Second Mexican War, a task in which he was not successful.\n\nIn 1882, Hamlin was one of several prominent Republican leaders to attend a convention called by Lincoln at the Florence Hotel in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. He resisted Lincoln's proposal to replace hostility toward the Confederacy with workers' rights as the central plank of the party's platform. The rejection of this proposal led to Lincoln's defection to the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] and the end of the Republican Party as an effective force in American politics.\n\n===Haywood, Bill===\n(GW:WH)\n\nLike he was in our timeline, '''[[Bill Haywood|\"Big Bill\" Haywood]]''' is a [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] bigwig in the U.S. during the Great War. He is introduced to Flora Hamburger by Herman Bruck at a [[May Day]] rally, and eyes her with lust.  Flora doesn't seem to like him, but does acknowledge that he brings a furious energy to the cause that makes him a force to be reckoned with.\n\n===Hemingway, Ernest===\n(GW:WH, AE:CCH-AE:VO)\n\nKnown only as \"Ernie\", the novelist '''[[Ernest Hemingway]]''' was an [[ambulance]] driver in the U.S. Army on the [[Qu\u00e9bec]] front in the Great War (in our timeline Hemingway drove an ambulance in [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Italy]] during [[World War I]]), Ernest was strafed by a [[Royal Flying Corps|British aircraft]] and severely wounded in the groin. After the war, his [[impotence]] served as a constant frustration. He ghost-wrote Sylvia Enos' book, ''I Sank Roger Kimball'', and was involved in an affair with his client. He accidentally shoots her when attempting [[suicide]] while he is drunk. He then shoots himself in remorse. (In our timeline, Hemingway lived to 1961, shooting himself to death but no one else.) In the Southern Victory Series,  he never becomes a prominent author\u2014though he does have work published.\n\n===Holmes, Oliver Wendell===\n(GW:WH-AE:VO)\n\n'''[[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]]''' becomes Chief Justice of the United States rather than associate justice, as he does in our timeline. He is one of the last surviving [[US Civil War|War of Secession]] veterans and manages to outlive even General [[George Armstrong Custer]]. Holmes is a staunch Democratic supporter, who is very displeased in 1920 at having to administer the oath of office to [[Upton Sinclair]], the first Socialist President. He dies in 1935 (the same year of his death in our timeline) during [[Herbert Hoover]]'s administration. He is replaced as Chief Justice by Cicero Pittman in time for [[Al Smith]]'s inauguration in 1937.\n\n===Hoover, Herbert===\n(AE:CCH-AE:VO)\n\n'''[[Herbert Hoover]]''' was part of the Coolidge-Hoover Democratic ticket that defeated the Blackford-[[Hiram Johnson|Johnson]] Socialist ticket during the Democratic sweep in [[1932 United States presidential election|1932]]. When President-Elect [[Calvin Coolidge]] died less than a month before he got into office, Hoover took over. The only thing his term was known for was making the situation in [[Kentucky]], [[Texas Panhandle|Houston]], [[Oklahoma|Sequoyah]], and [[Utah]] worse. He ended the Pacific War with a [[status quo ante bellum]] \"peace\" with [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] and allowed [[Jake Featherston]] to begin rebuilding the [[Confederate Army]] in the face of the \"black rebellion\". Hoover was also derided for not doing anything to help the [[Great Depression]]. Because of this, the Democrats were defeated with a Socialist sweep the Congressional elections of 1934 and he lost the presidential race to Socialist [[Al Smith]] in [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]]. The term \u201c[[Hoovervilles]]\u201d still exists in this alternate timeline albeit created by the Socialists to denote the continued existence of \u201cBlackfordboroughs\u201d (shanty towns built as a result of the Business Collapse in 1929) during Hoover\u2019s presidency and to detract from the legacy of his failed Socialist predecessor, Hosea Blackford.\n\n===Humphrey, Hubert===\n(AE:VO)\n\n'''[[Hubert Humphrey]]''' is referred to as the \"[[pharmacist]] from [[Minneapolis]].\" He wisely decides not to move his business to [[Rosenfeld, Manitoba]], where the local [[general store]] (owned by an American) had been bombed by Mary MacGregor Pomeroy several years before.\n\n===Johnson, Hiram===\n(AE:CCH)\n\n'''[[Hiram Johnson]]''' was the Socialist nominee for vice-president in both the [[1928 United States presidential election|1928]] and [[1932 United States presidential election|1932 elections]]. He and [[Hosea Blackford]] won the 1928 election over [[Calvin Coolidge]]; the victory was clinched after the Socialists won Johnson's home state of [[California]]. He was present at the Socialist party rally that was held on the same day that [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] raided [[Los Angeles]]. Blackford and Johnson were easily defeated in 1932 by Coolidge and [[Herbert Hoover]].\n\n===Kennedy, Joseph P. Sr.===\n(AE:CCH-AE:VO, SA:ID)\n\n'''[[Joseph Kennedy]]''', in this timeline, was a Democratic Party [[organizer (party)|organizer]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. Although married to [[Rose Kennedy]] and the father of [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.]], he attempted to seduce Sylvia Enos, who was a minor heroine for killing Roger Kimball, and was campaigning for him at his political rallies.\n\nAfter the Second Great War, Kennedy helped obtain the discharge of George Enos Jr., from the navy to allow him to return to civilian life.\n\n===Kennedy, Joseph Jr.===\n(SA:RE)\n\n'''[[Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.|Joseph Kennedy, Jr.]]''' is a [[fighter pilot]] serving in the same squadron as Jonathan Moss during Operation [[Blackbeard]]. It is unknown whether he survived the Second Great War. In our timeline, he did not survive [[World War II]].\n\n===La Follette, Robert M.===\n(GW:WH)\n\n'''[[Robert M. La Follette]]''' was a Socialist U.S. Senator from [[Wisconsin]]. In 1916, he won re-election handily. His son [[Fictional characters in the Southern Victory Series#Charles W. La Follette|Charles]] (who is primarily modeled after his real life son [[Robert M. La Follette, Jr.]]<ref>https://twitter.com/HNTurtledove/status/1000485494503849985</ref>) went on to become a key figure of American history in the 1930s and '40s.\n\n===LaGuardia, Fiorello===\n(AE:VO)\n\n'''[[Fiorello LaGuardia]]''' is elected [[Governor of New York]] on the Socialist ticket and attends the [[New York City]] Remembrance Day parade shortly before the beginning of the Second Great War.\n\n===Lansing, Robert===\n(GW:B)\n\n'''[[Robert Lansing]]''' was the [[United States Secretary of State]] at the conclusion of the Great War in 1917, and was responsible for drafting the terms of the [[peace treaty]] with the [[Confederate States]] and setting policy for Occupied Canada.\n\n===Liggett, Hunter===\n(AE:BI-AE:CCH)\n\n'''[[Hunter Liggett]]''' replaced General [[Leonard Wood]] as Army Chief of Staff under President [[Upton Sinclair]]. He appeared unenthusiastic about some of the Socialists' more unrealistic policies.\n\n===Lincoln, Abraham===\n(HFR, GW:AF)\n\nIn this timeline, '''[[Abraham Lincoln]]''' was a one-term president who was defeated in the [[1864 United States presidential election|1864 election]] in a landslide, and who was generally remembered as a failure. After his presidency, he travels around the country as an [[orator]] advocating for labor rights. In 1881, feeling that the Republican party was no longer true to its original roots, he led a faction of the party to break off and join the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] with Marxist activist [[Friedrich Sorge]], which eventually became the major opposition to the Democrats and one of the two main parties in the American political system. After which, he spends the rest of his days in seclusion outside [[Chicago]].\n\nIn the prologue of ''Great War: American Front,'' while considering the mediation put forth by British ambassador Richard Lyons, Lincoln makes a solemn vow that the United States would find European allies to someday get even with England and France for their violating of the [[Monroe Doctrine]] and helping of the CSA. Though laughed at by Lyons, his prediction would eventually come true by the Great War.\n\n===Lincoln, Mary Todd===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[Mary Todd Lincoln]]''' was the wife of former President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. As her husband was not assassinated in 1865, she did not suffer from mental illness. In the late 1870s, Mary Lincoln died of typhus.\n\n===Mahan, Alfred Thayer===\n(GW:WH)\n\n'''[[Alfred Mahan]]''' was a two-term Democratic president from 1889 to 1897. During his time in office, Mahan threatened to declare war on the Confederate States because of a proposal by the CSA to build a canal in Nicaragua in order to reach their Pacific port in Guaymas, Sonora, without having to travel around South America. After receiving the threat of war, the CSA backed down in their attempt to build the canal. [[Fictional characters in the Southern Victory Series#Carsten, Sam|Sam Carsten]] mentions that he might be the best President the country had ever had before [[Theodore Roosevelt]].\n\n===Moran, Edward===\n(AE:VO)\n\nCongressman '''[[Edward C. Moran, Jr.]]''' of [[Maine]] is a Democrat who debates Flora Blackford on whether or not the United States should interfere with the treatment of blacks in the [[Confederate States of America|CSA]].\n\n===Patrick, Mason===\n(GW:AF-GW:B)\n\n[[Brigadier General]] '''[[Mason Patrick]]''' was a senior aviator in the [[U.S. Army]] air service and served on the [[Canada|Canadian]] front in the Great War.\n\n===Pershing, John \"Black Jack\"===\n(GW:AF-AE:CCH)\n\n'''[[John Pershing]]''' was commanding general of the US Second Army and rival of [[George Custer]]'s First Army in the Great War. After the Socialist victory over the Democrats, he became [[military governor]] of [[Utah]]. In 1929, a [[Mormon]] sniper killed him, and he was succeeded by Colonel Abner Dowling, erstwhile commandant of [[Salt Lake City]].\n\n===Pitney, Mahlon===\n(AE:BI)\n\nRather than being appointed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1912, as he was in our timeline, '''[[Mahlon Pitney]]''' goes to Canada to preside over trials in occupied country.\n\n===Pope, John===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]]''' was the commander of U.S. forces in [[Utah]] during the Second Mexican War. He was responsible for ordering the [[execution]] of several [[Mormon]] leaders during the attempted revolt in Utah. Pope also arrested former president [[Abraham Lincoln]] for allegedly having Mormon sympathies, but President [[James Blaine]] ordered Lincoln's release.\n\n===Reagan, Ronald===\n(AE:VO)\n\n'''[[Ronald Reagan]]''', \"Dutch\", like this timeline's counterpart, was a sports announcer in [[Iowa]] between the wars. His favorite phrase in games is \"There he goes again\" (similar to one of Reagan's most familiar phrases in our timeline, \"[[There you go again]]\"). Cincinnatus Driver also describes \"Dutch\" as a \"great communicator\", a description applied to the historical Reagan.\n\n===Reed, Thomas Brackett===\n(GW:AF)\n\n'''[[Thomas Brackett Reed]]''' was a Democratic president sometime in the late 1890s. Like [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]], Reed was considered a hero of the Remembrance ideology. Reed entered the United States into a mutual-defense pact with [[Haiti]]. Presumably this helped curb [[Confederate States of America|CSA]] designs in the [[Caribbean]] while at the same time irritating the CS government, which had long desired the destruction of the former slave colony. This pact was reaffirmed by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] during the Great War.\n\nReed was depicted on a [[United States half dollar coin|fifty-cent coin]] used as currency during the Great War.\n\n===Rickover, Hyman G.===\n(SA:ID)\n\nCaptain '''[[Hyman G. Rickover]]''', [[U.S. Navy]] testifies before a House of Representatives committee, as an expert on [[submarines]] (as he was in our timeline).  Rickover has the unpleasant task of explaining why the U.S. has not yet built copies of [[German High Seas Fleet]] submarines.\n\n===Rogers, Will===\n(AE:VO)\n\n'''[[Will Rogers]]''' is referred to as \"that comic from [[State of Sequoyah|Sequoyah]]\" (an [[Oklahoma]] native in our timeline). As in our timeline, he is quoted as having said, \"All I know is what I read in the newspapers.\"\n\n{{anchor|Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt|Roosevelt, Franklin}}\n\n===Roosevelt, Franklin D.===\n(AE:CCH, SA:RE-SA:ID)\n\n'''[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]''' is Secretary of War in the [[Herbert Hoover]] administration and later Assistant Secretary of War under the [[Alfred E. Smith]] and [[Fictional characters in the Southern Victory Series#Charles W. La Follette|Charles W. La Follette]] Administrations. He is not much in the public eye, but plays a key role being in charge of the United States [[Manhattan Project|nuclear program]] at the [[Hanford site]]. Roosevelt is [[paraplegic]] and uses a [[wheelchair]]. He has a platonic affair with Flora Blackford. There is no mention of his being married in this timeline to [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]. It noted that his son (who goes unnamed) is in the [[US Navy]] during the Second Great War.\n\n===Roosevelt, Theodore===\n(HFR-AE:CCH)\n\n'''[[Theodore Roosevelt]]''', called '''Teddy''' or '''TR''' in the press, became a national figure for leading a volunteer cavalry unit, the \"Unauthorized Regiment,\" in the [[Second Mexican War]], during which he developed an intense rivalry with [[George Custer]]. A member of the Democratic Party, he was [[President of the United States]] from 1913 to 1921. Roosevelt was the first president to run for a third term, but he was ultimately defeated by Socialist [[Upton Sinclair]] in [[1924 United States presidential election|1920]]. After he died suddenly of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] while [[golf]]ing in 1924, he was buried at [[Robert E. Lee]]'s house in [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]] which had been annexed to [[West Virginia]] from [[Virginia]] after the Great War. He died in 1919 in our timeline.\n\n===Rosecrans, William===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[William Rosecrans]]''' was a lead general in the Second Mexican War. He was partly responsible for the U.S. defeat as he admitted to observers on the [[Kentucky]] front that he had no real strategy to defeat the [[Confederate States]].\n\n===Sevareid, Eric===\n(SA:ID)\n\n'''[[Eric Sevareid]]''' was a [[radio]] broadcaster for U.S. Wireless [[Atlanta]], which was established after the fall of Atlanta, possibly to counter Confederate Connie. After the death of [[Jake Featherston]], Sevareid was one of the broadcasters who interviewed Cassius Madison.\n\n===Shaw, Robert Gould===\n(GW:AF)\n\nIronically, '''[[Robert Gould Shaw]]''', the man who in our timeline led the [[54th Massachusetts]], one of the first all black regiments in the [[US Civil War]], ends up surviving through the War of Secession, though losing a hand in the process, and lives on until 1914 in [[Boston]]. He was depicted as an elderly [[racist]] with little money.\n\n===Sherman, William T.===\n(HFR)\n\nDespite having fought with valor and distinction at the historical [[Battle of Bull Run (disambiguation)|Battles of Bull Run]] and [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]], the victories of '''[[William Tecumseh Sherman]]''' amounted to nothing after the United States' defeat at [[Camp Hill, Glenn Springs, South Carolina|Camp Hill]] and the encirclement of [[Washington, DC]]. Sherman was stripped of his rank of [[brigadier general]] and would never command regular troops again.  Sherman remained in the [[US Army]] and by 1881, he commanded the defences of [[San Francisco]] from his headquarters at the [[Presidio of San Francisco|Presidio]]. When the Second Mexican War began later that year, Sherman organised volunteers and harbour guns in preparation for any attacks. His efforts were mocked by [[Samuel Clemens]] in his newspaper, the San Francisco ''Morning Call''. Because of this, he investigated Clemens on suspicion that he was a Confederate agent, but found nothing to substantiate it and gave Clemens a letter to that effect.\n\nAs the war dragged on, the [[Royal Navy]] of the United Kingdom turned up the pressure against the United States in support of their Confederate ally and attacked San Francisco. In spite of Sherman's preparations, the harbour guns were ineffective and his troops proved inadequate in stopping the [[Royal Marines]] from raiding the [[San Francisco Mint]]. After the raid, Sherman was ridiculed in the city's papers. However, after the cease fire was called, Sherman loudly insisted that with more fortifications, he could make the city impregnable.\n\n===Shirer, William===\n(SA:ID)\n\n'''[[William Shirer]]''' is a U.S. broadcaster who interviews Cassius Madison in his tour of the U.S. after killing [[Jake Featherston]].\n\n===Sinclair, Upton===\n(AE:BI-AE:VO)\n\n'''[[Upton Sinclair]]''' was the first [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] President. He was elected over [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in the [[1920 United States presidential election|1920 election]] for a number of reasons, including (but not limited to) worker unrest, outrage at Roosevelt's decision to run for a third term, and the public's general exhaustion with the Remembrance ideology. His first acts were to slash the military budget, force [[George Custer|General Custer]] into retirement and enact new labor laws. He was re-elected in [[1924 United States presidential election|1924]], where he and the Socialist Party take credit for the [[Roaring Twenties]] prosperity. Sinclair declined to run for a third term in [[1928 United States presidential election|1928]] and was succeeded in office by his Vice President, [[Hosea Blackford]], who defeated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic candidate]] [[Calvin Coolidge]] by a narrow margin.\n\n===Smith, Al===\n(AE:VO-SA:RE)\n\n'''[[Al Smith]]''' is elected as the third Socialist (and first [[Catholic]]) President in the [[1936 United States presidential election|1936 election]], defeating Democrat [[Herbert Hoover]]. He is known as the \"Happy Warrior\" since he tries everything to keep the United States out of war with [[Jake Featherston]]'s [[Confederate States]], including the infamous Richmond Agreement, helping to gain him re-election over [[Robert A. Taft|Robert Taft]] in [[1940 United States presidential election|1940]]. All of Smith's efforts simply delay the inevitable; Featherston scraps any agreement with Smith and once again demands territorial concession.  Smith refuses, touching off the Second Great War in June, 1941 (in an operation patterned after OTL's [[Operation Barbarossa]]). Smith is killed in his second term (1942) when Confederate bombers blew up parts of [[Powel House]] and destroy his [[bunker]].\n\nSmith shares parallels with [[Neville Chamberlain]], who attempted, but failed, to prevent war in our timeline with a [[fascist]] regime through the use of [[appeasement]].\n\n===Smith, Kate===\n(SA:G)\n\n'''[[Kate Smith]]''' was a famous U.S. singer in this timeline as well as ours. In 1943, she sang \"[[God Bless America|God Bless the Stars and Stripes]]\" with backing by [[Satchmo]] and the Rhythm Aces.\n\n===Sousa, John Philip===\n(GW:AF and AE:BI)\n\nThe marches of '''[[John Philip Sousa]]''' in this timeline were very popular in the United States. The Socialists despised him as a tool who substituted nationalist desires for vengeance for the class struggle, but respected his talents.\n\n===Stassen, Harold===\n(SA:ID)\n\n'''[[Harold Stassen]]''' was peripherally mentioned as \"the governor of [[Minnesota]]\" as the Republican Party's candidate for President in the [[1944 United States presidential election|1944 election]], carrying electoral votes from the four states of [[Minnesota]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Kansas]], and [[Indiana]] in a three-way race against Socialist [[Fictiobal characters in the Southern Victory Series#Charles W. La Follette|Charles W. LaFollette]] and Democrat [[Thomas E. Dewey]].\n\n===Stearns, Foster===\n(SA:G)\n\n'''[[Foster Waterman Stearns|Foster Stearns]]''' is a United States Congressman from [[New Hampshire]], in office during the second Great War. He is on the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the war, along with [[Fictional characters in the Southern Victory series#Flora Hamburger|Flora Hamburger]] and [[Robert A. Taft|Robert Taft]]. It is Stearns who learns from the hospital and reveals to his fellow legislators that Taft was killed in a [[Suicide attack|people bombing]].\n\n===Stedman, Seymour===\n(AE:BI)\n\n'''[[Seymour Stedman]]''' was a Socialist Congressman from [[Ohio]]. In the Socialist-majority Congress of 1919, he was elected [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]]. Stedman became the first non-Democrat since 1881 to be elected as Speaker.\n\n===Sutro, Adolph===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[Adolph Sutro]]''' is still the mayor of [[San Francisco]], [[California]] as in our timeline. His mayorship was heavily criticized for incompetence, particularly after the British [[Royal Navy]] bombarded the city and [[Royal Marines]] raided the [[San Francisco Mint]]. Sutro was a supporter of President [[James G. Blaine]] and designed several outlandish security measures to protect San Francisco (which was an extremely low priority target) from attack during the Second Mexican War. Ironically, when the British did attack the city, the defenses Sutro proposed proved worthless.\n\nOne of Sutro's most vocal critics was [[Samuel Clemens]], who named his dog Sutro as an insult to the mayor.\n\n===Taft, Robert===\n(AE:VO, SA:DE-SA:G)\n\n'''[[Robert A. Taft]]''' was a Democratic Senator from [[Ohio]] who ran against [[Al Smith]] in the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 presidential election]]. Taft was narrowly defeated running his campaign on an anti-Freedom Party line and the refusal to permit the states of [[Kentucky]] and [[Texas Panhandle|Houston]] to hold a [[plebiscite]] to return to the [[Confederate States of America|CSA]]. During the Second Great War, he and former rival Flora Blackford (who had known [[William H. Taft|his father]] before him) became fast friends and political allies as Flora became more hawkish as the war went on. Taft died in 1943, a victim of a [[Mormon]] [[suicide bomber]] in [[Philadelphia]].\n\n===Taft, William Howard===\n(GW:B-AE:BI)\n\n'''[[William Howard Taft]]''' was a Democratic Congressman from [[Ohio]] who served on the Transportation Committee during the later days of the Great War. He was on the same committee as Socialist congresswoman Flora Hamburger, and the two frequently disagreed on many political issues. His son [[Robert A. Taft]] became an important ally of hers during the Second Great War.\n\n===Thomas, Norman===\n(AE:BI-AE:CCH)\n\n'''[[Norman Thomas|N. Mattoon Thomas]]''' served as Undersecretary of War in the [[Upton Sinclair]] Administration, often as Sinclair's hatchet man. He was responsible for informing General [[George A. Custer]] of his forced retirement and for closing down the [[tank|Barrel]] Works.\n\n===Tilden, Samuel J.===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[Samuel Tilden]]''' was [[President of the United States]] from 1877 to 1881. He was nominated by the Democrats for [[1880 United States presidential election|reelection in 1880]], but lost to Republican [[James G. Blaine]]. Tilden was defeated for not taking a hard line against the Confederate States and for ordering the removal of twelve stars (representing the former Union states in the [[Confederate States of America|CSA]]) from the U.S. flag.\n\n===Truman, Harry===\n(SA:ID)\n\n'''[[Harry Truman]]''' was a Democratic Senator from [[Missouri]] who was selected by [[New York Governor]] [[Thomas E. Dewey]] as the Democratic VP candidate in [[1944 United States presidential election|1944]]. The Dewey-Truman ticket defeated the incumbent President [[Fictional characters in the Southern Victory Series#Charles W. La Follette|Charles W. La Follette]]. In announcing the Democratic victory, Truman had a copy of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' that had the inaccurate headline \"[[Dewey Defeats Truman|La Follete Beats Dewey]]\". Truman made an appearance in occupied [[Florida]] to speak to U.S. soldiers before his inauguration as Vice President. He made it clear to the locals that the United States would be firm in the former Confederate States, but that they would be no firmer than needed, and that if they worked together they could one day be part of the same country once again.\n\n===Voorhis, Jerry===\n(AE:VO)\n\n'''[[Jerry Voorhis]]''' was the United States ambassador to the [[Confederate States]] prior to the start of the Second Great War. After delivering news to [[Jake Featherston]] that U.S. president [[Al Smith]] refused the latest C.S. territorial demands, the C.S. president told Voorhis to leave the country within 24 hours; soon after this meeting, Featherston authorized the commencement of Operation [[Blackbeard]].\n\n===Wallace, Henry===\n(SA:RE)\n\n'''[[Henry A. Wallace]]''' was [[US Secretary of the Interior]] under [[Al Smith]]. He was one of the few people who knew of the United States' plans to develop [[nuclear weapons]] during the Second Great War.\n\n===Wayne, John===\n(AE:VO)\n\n'''[[John Wayne]]''' is an actor known in this world under his real name, '''Marion Morrison'''. He played [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in a movie that recounted the details of the Battle of [[Montana]] in ''How Few Remain''.\n\n===Willkie, Wendell===\n(AE:VO)\n\n'''[[Wendell Willkie]]''' was the Republican nominee for president in the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 election]], both in this timeline and our history. As the Republicans had become a third party in this timeline, Willkie was not considered to seriously contend for the presidency. On election day, he only carried the electoral votes from his home state of [[Indiana]] and came in third after [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] incumbent [[Al Smith]] and the Democratic challenger [[Robert A. Taft|Robert Taft]]. Ironically, Willkie's slogan was \"Win With Wendell\".\n\n===Winchell, Walter===\n(SA:ID)\n\n'''[[Walter Winchell]]''' was a news reporter from [[New York City]] who was one of those to interview Cassius Madison after he shot [[Jake Featherston]]. During his interview with Winchell, Cassius found his accent difficult to understand.\n\n===Wood, Leonard===\n(GW:AF-GW:B)\n\nGeneral '''[[Leonard Wood]]''' was Chief of the General Staff of the U.S. Army during the Great War.\n\n===Yount, Barton K.===\n(SA:ID)\n\n'''[[Barton Kyle Yount]]''' is a [[United States Army]] [[major general (United States)|major general]], and as the Second Great War ends, he commands what is possibly the largest air training center in the world, just outside of [[Dayton, Ohio]]. He offers Jonathan Moss the opportunity to train to fly [[jet aircraft|turbo aircraft]]. Moss gladly takes him up on his offer.\n\n==Confederate States==\n\n===Arango, Doroteo===\n(GW:AF-GW:WH, AE:BI)\n\nDuring the Great War, '''[[Pancho Villa|Doroteo Arango]]''' (known by the ''[[nom de guerre]]'' \"Pancho Villa\" in our timeline) was the Radical Liberal presidential candidate in the 1915 election. He promised he would fight the war against the United States even harder than [[Woodrow Wilson]] did. He is also the first non-white candidate to seriously run for the presidency of the Confederacy and showed the wartime strains on the ruling Whig Party, as the war dragged on and the United States' numbers and the Red Rebellion started to strain the Confederates. He was not opposed due to his ethnicity (Mixed \"Mestizo\" Mexican), only his political views. The [[Mexican Revolution]] in which our timeline's Pancho Villa had a major role has its counterpart in the Republican revolt against the [[Habsburg]] Emperors of this timeline's [[Second Mexican Empire|Mexico]], which is crushed with the help of Freedom Party stalwarts. However, in the Confederate-annexed parts of Mexico, it is the Freedom Party itself which mobilises the peasants to overthrow the centuries-old rule of the big landowners.\n\n===Benjamin, Judah===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[Judah P. Benjamin]]''' was [[Confederate States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] under President [[Jefferson Davis]], and served in the Cabinets of many others of the Confederacy's first generation of leaders. He led his country's diplomatic efforts in the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]]. During the presidency of [[James Longstreet]], Judah Benjamin was the ambassador to the United States. Despite his best efforts, he was not able to prevent the [[Second Mexican War]] of 1881\u201382.\n\nDuring the closing days of the Second Mexican War, Benjamin became aware that Senator [[Wade Hampton III]] was attempting to recruit support for a coup should Longstreet go through with his plans to end slavery. He also knew that Hampton had unsuccessfully attempted to recruit [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas Jackson]], a fact which surprised Jackson.\n\n===Black, Hugo===\n(AE:CCH)\n\n'''[[Hugo Black]]''' was the Whig Party's Vice-Presidential nominee in 1933 during the Freedom electoral sweep. He ran with [[James Longstreet]]'s grandson [[Fictional characters in the Southern Victory Series#Samuel Longstreet|Samuel Longstreet]], and was caught in a riot against Freedom Party stalwarts during the 1933 Election Riots. The Longstreet-Black ticket lost in a landslide to the [[Jake Featherston|Featherston]]-Knight ticket. This defeat made it the first Presidential election in Confederate history where the Whig candidates lost.\n\n===Castro, Fidel===\n(SA:G)\n\nKnown by his first name only, '''[[Fidel Castro]]''' is a young leader of an anti-Freedom Party group in Confederate Cuba, working closely with the United States which sends him clandestine shipments of arms and ammunition.\n\n===Carter, Jimmy===\n(SA:DE)\n\nA [[Confederate Navy]] sailor, '''[[Jimmy Carter]]''' (1924-1942) was on leave and found himself informally in charge of the defense of his hometown of [[Plains, Georgia]] when the black rebels raided the town. He was killed by Jonathan Moss in front of his mother, \"[[Lillian Gordy Carter|Miss Lillian]]\". In our timeline, he remains alive in 2020.\n\n===Chapman, Ben===\n(AE:VO)\n\nInstead of becoming notorious in the [[baseball]] world for his attitude towards [[Jackie Robinson]], '''[[Ben Chapman (baseball)|Ben Chapman]]''' serves in the Freedom Party guards as a Chief Assault Band Leader (a captain in Army ranking). His first and only appearance in the books is when he shows up at Camp Dependable in the dead of night to drop off [[Willy Knight]] as a political prisoner.\n\n{{anchor|Nathan Bedford Forrest III}}\n\n===Forrest, Nathan Bedford III===\n(AE:VO-SA:ID)\n\nA great-grandson of [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] was the head of the Confederate General Staff. Instead of airplane warfare, '''[[Nathan Bedford Forrest III]]''', was a [[tank|barrel]] expert. Forrest was valued by [[Jake Featherston]] because he was unafraid to tell the President the truth about how the war was going, instead of being a \"yes man\" and only telling him what he wanted to hear. When an increasingly stubborn Featherston rejects Forrest's advice to cut short the [[Pittsburgh]] Campaign, thus dooming [[George Patton]]'s entire army of irreplaceable veterans to death or surrender, he begins plotting with Clarence Potter based on concerns about Featherston's sanity and whether new leadership was needed, for Forrest fears a Confederate loss and what the Yankees would do if they defeated the Confederacy again.\n\nWith the Confederate war effort collapsing, Forrest attempted to execute a coup to oust Featherston in 1944, analogous to the [[July 20 Plot]], but was thwarted by the President. Forrest never revealed that he had ever discussed the failed coup with Potter. Eventually, Forrest was killed off for his attempt.\n\n===Gresham, James Bethel===\n(SA:G)\n\n[[James Bethel Gresham]] is a Kentuckian who was among the first Confederate soldiers to be killed in the Great War. Michael Pound and his [[Tank|barrel]] platoon capture a bridge named in Gresham's honor. In our timeline, James Bethel Gresham was born in [[Kentucky]], but moved to [[Indiana]] when he was young. Gresham is considered the first Hoosier serviceman (and perhaps the first American serviceman) to die in [[World War I]].\n\n===Hope, Bob===\n(SA:RE)\n\n'''[[Bob Hope]]''' is a comic seen entertaining the troops in Occupied [[Ohio]]. He was booed offstage for his non realistic war jokes and for not being \"[[Satchmo]] and the Rhythm Aces\".\n\n===Howard, Robert E.===\n(AE:CCH)\n\nThe Conan the Barbarian creator is an unnamed reference in a Jefferson Pinkard chapter as a contributor to Aeroplane Adventures. The book references a young Texan author from Cross Plains where Howard lives for most of his short life; in reality this would have been around the time he wrote \u2018The Shadow Kingdom\u2019, which was published in Weird Times.\n\n===Jackson, Thomas J. \"Stonewall\"===\n(HFR)\n\nBecause of the Confederate victory in 1862, '''[[Stonewall Jackson]]''' did not die in 1863 as he did in our timeline. In the twenty years from the [[US Civil War|War of Secession]] to the Second Mexican War, Jackson became the head of the Confederate General Staff in the [[James Longstreet]] Administration. His brilliant tactics in the Second Mexican War led to victory for the Confederacy. Also critical to the Confederate cause was his decision to let the captured [[Frederick Douglass]] go free, after a memorable debate between the two showing some grudging mutual respect - a decision which eventually helped the Confederacy cement British and [[Third French Republic|French]] support for its cause. Subsequently, Jackson refused [[Wade Hampton III]]'s proposal to lead a coup against Longstreet after Longstreet began steps to end slavery.\n\nHis face appeared on the Confederate five-dollar coin, which naturally came to be called a \"Stonewall\".\n\n===Lamar, Lucius Q. C.===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar (II)|Lucius Lamar]]''' is the vice president of the Confederate States under his cousin [[James Longstreet]]. It is mentioned that Lamar would have acted as president should anything have happened to President Longstreet while he visited the war front in [[Kentucky]].\n\n===Lee, Robert E.===\n(GW:AF)\n\n'''[[Robert E. Lee]]''' is the Confederacy's military hero. It is his decision to invade [[Maryland]], and the complete failure of Union general [[George B. McClellan|George McClellan]] to respond that allows the CS to gain military victory, and receive recognition as a country from Britain and France.\n\nLee appears briefly in the prologue of GW:AF, which is set in 1862. He is heavily referenced throughout the series.\n\nIn AE:CCH, we learn that a man named 'Lee' was president. As Robert E. Lee was never said to have been president in the prior volumes, nor so described in subsequent volumes, a debate has developed among fans of the series, with some arguing that Robert E. was president, while others favor his more political nephew, [[Fitzhugh Lee]].\n\nThere is one apparent difference between Turtledove's character and the historic Lee. In our timeline, Lee became the president of Washington College in [[Lexington, Virginia]] immediately after the Civil War. He served in that role until his death in 1870, at which time the college adopted its current name of [[Washington and Lee University]]. In the Southern Victory Series, the college never added Lee's name\u2014it is referenced in several books in the series as Washington University.\n\n===Long, Earl===\n(AE:VO)\n\nAfter the assassination of their sibling, we learn that one of Governor [[Huey Long]]'s brothers is involved in some sort of machine gun \"accident\" and the other is imprisoned at \"Camp Dependable\" outside Alexandria, Louisiana for his brother's non-Freedom Party politics. Although in our timeline Huey Long had three brothers, George, Julius and '''[[Earl Long]]''', in the Southern Victory Series he has only two.\n\n===Long, Huey===\n(AE:CCH-AE:VO)\n\nIn this timeline, '''[[Huey Long]]''' was a Radical Liberal governor of [[Louisiana]] in the [[Confederate States]]. Like [[Jake Featherston]], he used strong-arm tactics to suppress opposition and control that state, erected prison camps for political opponents, but did not resort to anti-black [[racist]] demagoguery. He proved to be a danger to the Freedom Party in the 1932 elections and afterwards, where the Freedom Party was under attack in his state, and planned to run for president once Featherston ended his term (at the time, the clause in the Confederate constitution restricting a president to a single term was still in force). He was later killed by an assassin of the Freedom Party in 1938 after getting a warning about not following Jake Featherston's orders from [[Anne Colleton]]. (He lived 3 years longer than he did in our timeline.) This assassination allowed Featherston to have the entire Confederacy under his control. The conquest of Louisiana from Long and his followers is roughly the analogue of [[Hitler]]'s Austrian [[Anschluss]].\n\n===Longstreet, James===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[James Longstreet]]''' was a victorious Confederate general turned president of the CSA serving 1880-1886. Although having a reputation as being an opportunist, his term was known for the second defeat of the United States in the Second Mexican War and the [[manumission]] of the [[slaves]] as the price of British and French alliance for help in the Second Mexican War. Longstreet also prevented, with [[Stonewall Jackson]]'s help, a planned rebellion by [[Wade Hampton III]].\n\n===Mahon, George===\n(AE:VO)\n\n'''[[George H. Mahon|George Mahon]]''' was a Freedom Party Congressman from the State of [[Texas Panhandle|Houston]] who was among the Congressmen (from Houston and [[Kentucky]]) who demanded that plebiscites be held in order to return to the Confederate States (Houston had joined the U.S. in 1917). He eventually got his wish, and on January 7, 1941, Houston, along with Kentucky, was returned to the [[Confederate States of America|CSA]] by popular vote, and was restored to the state of [[Texas]].\n\n===McReynolds, James Clark===\n(AE:CCH-AE:VO)\n\n'''[[James Clark McReynolds]]''' was the last Chief Justice of the Confederate Supreme Court. He played a key role in the ruling allowing Burton Mitchel to run again out of fear of the Freedom Party after the Hampton assassination. Later he was noted for his battles in the early months of the first [[Jake Featherston]] administration, most importantly the \"torpedoing\" of the River and Dam Act. (This is roughly analogous to the opposition of McReynolds to much of [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] legislation in our timeline.) This led to the Featherston Administration finding a way to abolish the Supreme Court before it could strike down any more Freedom laws, (analogous to FDR's [[Court Packing]] plan in our timeline) and because Featherston wanted to settle accounts with the Court for its allowing Mitchel to run for re-election.\n\nAttorney General Ferdinand Koenig pounced on the precedent of the CSA not having a Supreme Court for the first five years of existence, and forced McReynolds to admit to the legality of that precedent as prelude to having the Supreme Court knocked down, to great fanfare across the Confederacy's white population. Threatened with his life by Featherston if he trifled with the abolition of the Supreme Court, McReynolds retired into private life. The Confederate president then went on the [[radio]] to declare: \"James McReynolds has made his decision, now let him enforce it!\" (echoing [[Worcester v. Georgia#Jackson's response|a quote attributed to Andrew Jackson]] following an 1832 U.S. Supreme Court decision).\n\n===Patman, Wright===\n(SA:ID)\n\n'''[[Wright Patman]]''' was the [[Governor of Texas]] during the Second Great War. In 1944, with the U.S. close to defeating the [[Confederate States of America|C.S.]], Patman seceded his state from the Confederacy and declared an independent [[Republic of Texas]] with himself as President. His first act was to obtain an armistice with the U.S., who immediately recognized his nation, although they continued stationing large numbers of soldiers there. To win brownie points with his new overlords, he turned over all Confederate [[war criminals]] that could be found in Texas, including [[Jefferson Pinkard]], for [[crimes against humanity]] trials.\n\n===Patton, George S.===\n(SA:RE-SA:ID)\n\nGeneral '''[[George S. Patton]]''', [[C.S. Army]], was in charge of the Confederate armored forces (Army of [[Kentucky]]) in Operation [[Blackbeard]] in [[Ohio]] and the attack on [[Pittsburgh]]. He had many of the same character traits as our timeline's Patton: strict attention to detail in a soldier's appearance, high standards and a short temper, highly-effective use of armor, and a seemingly-limitless drive and energy that inspired great confidence among the soldiers serving under him and made him an outstanding commander. But Patton in this timeline is also a different man known to us: instead of being the first American general to integrate his combat formations, this Patton is an unabashed racist and strong supporter of the Freedom Party.\n\nPatton was evacuated from the pocket at Pittsburgh before it fell in February 1943. He unsuccessfully tried to hold the U.S. Army out of Kentucky and [[Tennessee]]. This included an [[George S. Patton slapping incidents|incident]] where he slapped a soldier suffering from [[Combat stress reaction|battle fatigue]]. He would have shot the soldier save that other soldiers around them threatened to shoot Patton on the spot. He was reprimanded for this incident by President [[Jake Featherston]], who promised the average soldier a fair shake. Patton intensely disliked Brigadier General Clarence Potter and would have fought him in a duel had Featherston not forbidden it.\n\nPatton was a fierce and aggressive commander, but as the war turned against the Confederate States, Patton's instincts to attack every chance he got largely succeeded only in squandering men and materiel that the Confederacy could not easily replace. Patton's aggressiveness was checked by General [[Irving Morrell]], a punning reference to the real Patton's African contest with [[Erwin Rommel]]. When he switched tactics to fight a delaying action in [[Chattanooga]], he was bypassed by a U.S. airborne assault on the hills overlooking the city. Because of this, the U.S. drove to [[Atlanta]], disgracing him in Jake Featherston's eyes.\n\nBy 1944, Patton was forced to flee Atlanta and head into [[Alabama]]. With the U.S. ravaging his army, Patton was eventually forced to surrender in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]]. After giving a farewell address to his forces, his men crowded around to say their own goodbyes, an act which moved Patton to tears. He was subsequently taken in as a prisoner of war.\n\nNote: Though a [[Virginia]]n in the Southern Victory timeline, in our timeline Patton was born in [[California]]. In our timeline, General Patton's father, [[George S. Patton (attorney)|George William Patton]], was born in Virginia before Civil War, later moved to California in 1877. General Patton's grandfather, [[George S. Patton, Sr.]] was a Confederate colonel from Virginia killed in 1864 (an event which would not have happened in the alternate timeline). Because of Confederate won the Civil War in this timeline, General Patton's father wasn't likely to move to California, which is a Northern territory. With a Virginian military family background, it is highly possible that General Patton play the role as a Confederate General in an alternative world which Confederate won.\n\n===Russell, Richard Brevard Jr.===\n(AE:VO)\n\n'''[[Richard Brevard Russell, Jr.]]''' was the Confederate Ambassador to the United States before the Second World War. He was kicked out of the U.S. after President [[Jake Featherston]] kicked out the Confederacy's U.S. ambassador [[Jerry Voorhis]] from the C.S. as well.\n\n{{anchor|Sennacherib_.28.22Satchmo.22.29|Louis Armstrong|Satchmo}}\n\n===Satchmo===\n(AE:VO, SA:RE-SA:G)\n\nKnown in the Southern Victory world as '''Sennacherib (\"Satchmo\")''', [[Louis Armstrong]] in the [[Confederate States]], during the rise of the Freedom Party and the Featherston Administration, was the leader of the popular band \"Satchmo and the Rhythm Aces\". He was forced by the Confederate government during Second Great War to play for Confederate troops in Ohio. Satchmo and his band were able to escape to U.S. lines at night after one of their shows. In ''[[Drive to the East]]'', Satchmo and his band share the horrors of the Featherston government's treatment of [[African-Americans]] with Flora Blackford.  Subsequently, Satchmo and the Rhythm Aces produce [[propaganda]] for the U.S., although their style of music, unknown outside of the C.S., is a bit of a mystery to the average U.S. citizen.\n\n===Stuart, James Ewell Brown===\n(HFR)\n\nBecause of the CSA's victory in 1862, '''[[Jeb Stuart]]''' did not die in 1864 [[Battle of Yellow Tavern|as he did in history]]. During the Second Mexican War, General Stuart arrived in the former [[Second Mexican Empire|Mexican]] provinces of [[Sonora]] and [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] in order to ease their transition into C.S. territories (later states). After joining forces with [[Geronimo]] for raids on [[Arizona|western New Mexico]], Stuart was killed by an [[Apache]] [[sniper]] near the close of the war in 1882. His son Jeb Stuart Jr. (a person who had never known his father in real life) later became head of the Confederate War Department, and his (fictionalized) grandson Jeb Stuart III was a battery command officer on the [[Virginia]] front in the Great War.\n\nJ.E.B Stuart III once prevented Army intelligence from interrogating his manservant.  Later it was revealed that this servant had been a spy and a [[communist]] rebel. Stuart was humiliated, and assured by many that he would never rise above the rank of captain, despite his father's position in the war department. Destroyed, Stuart decided glory was all he had left, and died leading a charge across No Man's land.\n\nThis would greatly impact history, because it was [[Jake Featherston]] who had reported the man servant, and Stuart's father blamed him for his son's humiliation.  He ensured that Featherston also was never promoted, which infuriated Featherston forever after, leading him to write his infamous book ''Over Open Sights'', and later to purge the old military upon his ascension to [[President of the Confederate States]].  After that point, promotion and rank in the new army was based solely on talent and loyalty, which unfortunately for the United States, worked very well in the opening months of Operation [[Blackbeard]].\n\n=== Stuart, James Ewell Brown, Jr. ===\n(HFR, AE:BI, AE:VO)\n\nIt is debatable whether \"Jeb Stuart Jr.\" in this series is a historical character or a fictional one, see his article on [[Fictional characters in the Southern Victory Series#Stuart, Jeb Jr.|a different page]].\n\n===Thurmond, Strom===\n(SA:RE)\n\n'''[[Strom Thurmond]]''' was a Freedom Party Congressman from [[South Carolina]]. He is as conservative in this timeline as he was in ours. His name is never mentioned, but the viewpoint character [[Anne Colleton]] thinks of him as \"Storm, or something like that.\" Good on the \"[[Negro]] question, but weaker elsewhere\" was the view expressed of him by Anne, who was killed during the June 1941 [[U.S. navy]] raid on [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] just after Thurmond gave a speech. It is unknown whether Thurmond was killed in the same raid.\n\n===Walker, George Herbert===\n(SA:DE)\n\n[[Confederate Secretary of State]] during the Featherston Administration, '''[[George Herbert Walker]]''' is probably one of the few remaining old-liners to remain from the Whig Era into the Freedom Regime, since he is not considered to be part of the Freedom Party inner circle by Featherston. Walker is placed in charge of obtaining more soldiers from [[Second Mexican Empire|Mexico]] to aid the Confederacy after General Morrell's attacks destroyed the first three divisions in the 1942 U.S. offensive in [[Ohio]].\n\nThis is a little bit implausible, as Walker was from [[Missouri]] and his father [[David Davis Walker]] was from [[Illinois]], neither of which were Confederate states in this timeline or ours.\n\n===Wilson, Woodrow===\n(GW:AF-GW:WH)\n\n'''[[Woodrow Wilson]]''' was [[President of the Confederate States of America|President of the Confederate States]] from 1910 to 1916 on the Whig Party. He led the [[Confederate States of America|CSA]] to war with the United States in the summer of 1914, following the US declaration of war on the Confederacy.\n\n==Native Americans==\n\n===Geronimo===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[Geronimo]]''' led a band of [[Apache]] warriors into an alliance with [[Jeb Stuart]]'s army during the Second Mexican War. The alliance would not outlast the war. He led a rebellion against the Confederates following a dispute in territory occupied in [[New Mexico]]. During this, one of Geronimo's men shot and killed Stuart, which consequently led the Confederate Army to all but wipe the Apache tribes out.\n\n==Mormons==\n\n===Taylor, John===\n(HFR)\n\nThe [[Mormon]] leader '''[[John Taylor (Mormon)|John Taylor]]''' takes the opportunity to try to force the United States to recognize the believers' right to [[Mormonism and polygamy|practice]] [[polygamy]]. However, with the use of the new [[Gatling gun]] his rebellion is quickly crushed and he becomes a fugitive, facing death along with the other Mormon leaders if he is caught. The Union army places a price on his head, but he is never captured.\n\n==Canada==\n\n===Borden, Robert===\n(GW:AF)\n\n'''[[Robert Borden]]''' becomes [[Prime Minister of Canada]] during the Great War years in both our history and Turtledove's novels. When Canada was ceded to the U.S. after the war, his government was ejected from the occupied territory.\n\n==United Kingdom==\n\n===Churchill, Winston===\n(AE:VO, SA:RE-SA:ID)\n\n'''[[Winston Churchill]]''', in this timeline as in the real one, was the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]. He leads his nation into the [[Settling Accounts|Second Great War]] on what appears to be a platform of rearmament, restoration of the [[British Empire|British Empire's]] former borders, and a military alliance with France and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] aimed at reversing the [[German Empire|German Empire's]] dominant position in the world.\n\nAlthough he was a member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], his government's actions were strongly influenced by Silver Shirt leader [[Oswald Mosley]], who wielded much greater power and influence in the right-leaning revanchist Britain. In our timeline Mosley's [[British Union of Fascists]] were known as [[Blackshirts]], though Turtledove may be referencing the American fascist group linked to [[Bruno Hauptmann]] and the [[Lindbergh kidnapping|Lindbergh]] Baby case. It is unknown how his half-American heritage has influenced his relationship with the U.S. or whether his mother was still [[Jennie Jerome]], born in the [[Cobble Hill, Brooklyn|Cobble Hill]] section of [[Brooklyn]].\n\nChurchill authorized the British [[atomic bomb|superbomb]] attack on [[Hamburg]], and retaliated to the German superbomb attacks on [[London]], [[Norwich]], and [[Brighton]] by sending a plane with a second superbomb to attack Germany. However, the plane was shot down over Belgium and landed and detonated harmlessly between [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent, Belgium|Ghent]], all but ending Britain's chances to defeat Germany. Churchill was then ousted as Prime Minister in a no-confidence vote, and was succeeded by [[Horace Wilson (civil servant)|Horace Wilson]], who sought a cease-fire with Germany.\n\n===Edward VIII===\n(SA:ID)\n\nWith relations between the U.S. and the United Kingdom so bad in this timeline, '''[[Edward VIII]]''' never meets [[Wallis Simpson]], and so never abdicates his throne.  He is still the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|king of the United Kingdom]] when [[German Empire|Germany]] drops a [[Nuclear weapon|superbomb]] on [[London]]. Sam Carsten guesses that Edward VIII and his family got out of London even before the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] hit [[Hamburg]], knowing that the Germans would strike back.\n\n===George V===\n(AE:BI)\n'''[[George V]]''' was the King of the United Kingdom during the Great War. He was the last British monarch to hold a number of titles afforded to the ruler of the [[British Empire]], including the King of Ireland and the [[Monarch of Canada|King of Canada]], both of which he was forced to relinquish by the victorious [[Central Powers]].\n\nDuring the Great War, he relinquished all German titles and styles on behalf of his relatives who were British subjects; and changed the name of the royal house from [[Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]] to [[House of Windsor|Windsor]]. In the face of the United Kingdom's defeat in 1917, this act was token at best.\n\n[[Jake Featherston]] derisively compared [[Wade Hampton V]] to the British King during the 1921 Confederate States Presidential Election, a somewhat provocative act considering how staunchly Britain had supported the Confederate States.\n\nUpon his death on 20 January 1936 (the date of the death of the historic George V), he was succeeded by his oldest son [[Edward VIII]], who led the United Kingdom to defeat at the hands of the Central Powers in the Second Great War.\n\n===Halifax, Lord===\n(SA:ID)\n\n'''[[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]]''' was the British ambassador to the [[Confederate States]] during the Second Great War. He presented to [[C.S. President]] [[Jake Featherston]] materials on the British [[atomic bomb|superbomb]] project, which possibly helped the Confederacy develop their own superbomb.\n\n{{anchor|Lyons, Richard}}\n\n===Lyons, Richard Bickerton Pemell===\n(GW:AF)\n\n'''[[Richard Lyons, 1st Viscount Lyons|Richard Lyons]]''' was a British diplomat who was sent to Washington after the Battle of Camp Hill to advise [[Abraham Lincoln]] that the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] and [[Second French Empire|France]] were set to offer recognition to the Confederate States, and that if the U.S. did not do the same, Britain would defend the C.S. by use of its military. Lord Lyons also envisioned a time where both the U.S. and C.S. would \"stand together, [as] a pair of sturdy brothers,\" which never happened at any point of the Confederacy's independence between 1861 and 1944.\n\n===Mosley, Oswald===\n(AE:CCH-AE:VO, SA:ID)\n\n'''[[Oswald Mosley]]''' is the leader of the Silver Shirts, a fascist movement analogous to the [[British Union of Fascists]] (Turtledove conflates two OTL movements: Mosley's historical BUF, also known as the Blackshirts; and the [[Silver Legion of America|Silver Shirts]], an American fascist group linked to [[Bruno Hauptmann]] and the [[Lindbergh kidnapping|Lindbergh Baby case]]). Mosley and several members of the Union gain seats in the British parliament, creating an influential minority. In an attempt to stifle them, the Conservative Party formed a coalition with the Silver Shirts. However, this actually gave more power to the Silver Shirts. The fact that the Conservatives under the leadership of [[Winston Churchill]] had taken a revanchist just insured that the coalition left both parties indistinguishable. Churchill named Mosley [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] to mollify the Silver Shirts. During the later conflict with [[German Empire|Germany]] in 1941, Mosley was also given a position as Minister of War.\n\nShortly after Germans shot down a British plane carrying the second British superbomb in Belgium in 1944, he was ousted as Chancellor of the Exchequer in a non-confidence vote.\n\n===Victoria===\n(HFR)\n\nAs in our timeline, '''[[Queen Victoria|Victoria]]''' was the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Queen]] of the United Kingdom and the [[British Empire]] from 1837 until her death in 1901.\n\nDuring her reign, Victoria's Empire intervened twice in North America within 20 years. The first time was in 1862 after the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]] destroyed the [[Army of the Potomac]] and occupied [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], the [[British Empire]] (along with [[Second French Empire|France]]) extended diplomatic recognition to the [[Confederate States]], ending the [[American Civil War|War of Seccession]]. The second time was in 1881 when the British Empire once again sided with the Confederacy and [[French Third Republic|France]] against the United States during the [[Second Mexican War]], after both a promise from the Confederacy to [[manumit]] their [[slaves]], and in response to the aggressive behavior from the United States.\n\n===Wilson, Horace===\n(SA:ID)\n\n'''[[Horace Wilson (civil servant)|Horace Wilson]]''' became the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] in 1944 in the wake of the ouster of [[Winston Churchill]] in a no-confidence vote. His first act as Prime Minister was to ask [[German Empire|Germany]] for a cease-fire.\n\n==France==\n\n===Duchamp, Marcel===\n(GW:AF)\n\n'''[[Marcel Duchamp]]''', in this timeline, is still a famous French artist, but this time his appeal in North America is limited to the upper-crust of the Confederacy. He tried to have an affair with [[Anne Colleton]], who exhibited some of his works at Marshlands [[plantations in the American South|Plantation]]. His works were all removed before [[Marxist]] rebel Cassius and his gang burned the mansion, and Cassius regretted not being able to destroy any Duchamp paintings, which he saw as eyesores.\n\n===Foch, Ferdinand===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[Ferdinand Foch]]''' is a major, the [[Third French Republic|French]] Military Attach\u00e9 to [[Washington, DC]], at the onset of the Second Mexican War. With his [[German Empire|German]] opposite number [[Alfred von Schlieffen]], and an unnamed British army captain, he accompanies [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Hannibal Hamlin]] and Captain Saul Berryman ([[U.S. Army]]) under a flag of truce to the [[Long Bridge (Potomac River)|Long Bridge]] outside Washington D.C. The truce, called by [[C.S. President]] [[James Longstreet]] and C.S. General [[Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson]], is designed to declare Washington D.C. an [[open city]], sparing its destruction.  The Confederate proposal is rejected by Berryman, under the authority of U.S. Commanding General [[William Rosecrans]].  The French and British are declared ''[[personae non gratae]]'' and asked to leave the United States.\n\n===Napoleon III===\n(HFR and GW:AF)\n\n'''[[Napoleon III]]''' installed [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] as the [[Emperor of Mexico]] in the 1860s, a move opposed by the United States under the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. His government was hostile to the United States, and in late 1862, during the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]], despite opposition to slavery, Napoleon III extended diplomatic recognition to the [[Confederate States]] and supported [[British Military]] protection over that country, thus beginning an alliance between France and the CS that would continue through the [[Settling Accounts|Second Great War]] over eighty years later. This eventually turned out to have been a major strategic blunder for which France paid a heavy price, since it threw the United States into the arms of [[German Empire|Germany]] in a rival alliance which triumphed in both the [[Great War (series)|Great War]] and the Second Great War.\n\nUltimately, Napoleon was forced to abdicate in 1870 during the disastrous [[Franco-Prussian War]]. He was also the last [[Monarchy of France|Monarch of France]] until King Charles XI under the [[Action Francaise]] party restored the monarchy around 1930.\n\n==Germany==\n\n===Einstein, Albert===\n(SA:DE)\n\n'''[[Albert Einstein]]''' is a German physicist who was believed to have been working on an [[atomic bomb]] project in Europe. Along with several other leading German and Austro-Hungarian physicists, Einstein disappeared from public view in 1942. Not long afterwards, the United States, along with [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], were suspected of beginning atomic bomb programs. Since in this world Germany never became [[Nazi]] and there were no persecutions of [[Jews]], he has no problem in contributing to the German war effort, especially as the war begins with Germany being attacked and invaded.\n\n===Guderian, Heinz===\n(GW:WH, AE:CCH)\n\nCaptain '''[[Heinz Guderian]]''' of the German Imperial Army was an observer attached to Irving Morrell's unit during the 1916 campaign in the [[Canadian Rockies]].  He expressed a more strategic view of the fighting than Major [[Eduard Dietl]], noting that fighting is done for a purpose.  He then displays his great insight into warfare by adding that the point of battle is to get behind the enemy and \"smash him up\".  (In our timeline, Guderian was one of the masterminds of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]'s [[Blitzkrieg]] tactics, in which the main goal is indeed to get behind the enemy and attack where the enemy is more vulnerable.)  Due to a desire to stay in the field rather than return to a desk position, Guderian stays with Morrell after Major Dietl returns to Austria, and accompanies him back to [[Philadelphia]], during which they meet Luther Bliss and the new Lieutenant Governor of [[Kentucky]].  Guderian makes another appearance, now as a [[lieutenant colonel]], in occupied Canada in 1926, when he shows up in [[Kamloops, British Columbia]], and asks Colonel Morrell for a tour of western Canada.  He is accompanied by his [[aide-de-camp]] Sergeant [[Adolf Hitler]], whose [[anti-Semitic]] views he does not care for.\n\n{{anchor|Adolf Hitler}}\n\n===Hitler, Adolf===\n(AE:CCH)\n\nBecause of the [[German Empire]]'s victory in this world, '''[[Adolf Hitler]]''' is a sergeant in the German Army. He holds the [[Iron Cross]], First Class. Morrell met him once as an orderly to Colonel [[Heinz Guderian]], who was on an inspection tour in [[Kamloops, British Columbia]], an occupied territory of the United States. Morrell thought that he was very much like [[Jake Featherston]], but with a hatred for [[Jews]] and [[Slavs]] rather than [[Africans]]. Hitler is never mentioned by name in CCH, but the author has acknowledged his identity. (See also Turtledove's short story \"Uncle Alf\" in the anthology ''Alternate Generals II'', narrated by a similar version of Hitler.)\n\n===Marx, Karl===\n(HFR-AE:CCH)\n\n'''Karl Marx''' was greatly admired by former [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]]. However, Lincoln did not agree with Marx's belief in violent revolution, and steered the [[Socialist Party of the United States]] towards change through the ballot, rather than the bullet at the party's founding 1882.\n\nIn the [[Confederate States]], black revolutionaries embraced Marx's call for revolution, staging a revolt during the early years of the [[Great War (series)|Great War]]. While various socialist republics such as the Black Belt Socialist Republic and Congaree Socialist Republic were created, the uprisings were crushed by the C.S. in short order.\n\n===Schacht, Hjalmar===\n\n'''[[Hjalmar Schacht]]''' is mentioned as being the German Ambassador to the United States on the eve of North American hostilities during the Second Great War.\n\n===von Schlieffen, Alfred===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[Alfred von Schlieffen]]''' was a [[colonel]] in the German [[army]] working as a military [[attach\u00e9]] before and during the Second Mexican War at the German embassy in the United States. His study of [[Robert E. Lee]]'s encirclement of [[Washington, D.C.]] is said to be the inspiration for the [[Schlieffen Plan]] of [[World War I]].\n\n===von Schl\u00f6zer, Kurd===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[Kurd von Schl\u00f6zer]]''' remained the [[German Empire]]'s ambassador to the United States as in our timeline. After U.S. President Blaine sued for peace during the Second Mexican War, Schl\u00f6zer and the German military attach\u00e9 Alfred von Schlieffen first brought up the idea of an alliance between the United States and the German Empire as a counterpart to the alliance between the United Kingdom, France and the [[Confederate States]], thus forming the foundations for the [[Central Powers]] and breaking the United States' policy of nonintervention in European affairs.\n\n===Wilhelm II, Kaiser===\n(GW:AF-AE:VO)\n\nKaiser '''[[Wilhelm II]]''' was the German Emperor and one of the main allies of the United States in World War I. \"Kaiser Bill\" was a popular character in the U.S. Many men wore a \"Kaiser Bill\" mustache in imitation of him. He lived until 1941 (as he did in our timeline), where his death and his son's coming to the throne and refusal to give France its [[Alsace-Lorraine|lost territory]] back started the Second Great War. He was the father of Kaiser [[Crown Prince Wilhelm of Germany|Friedrich Wilhelm V]].\n\n===Wilhelm III, Kaiser===\n(AE:VO, SA:RE-ID)\n\n[[Crown Prince Wilhelm of Germany|'''Friedrich Wilhelm''']], Crown Prince of Germany, became Kaiser of the German Empire in 1941, upon the death of his father, [[Wilhelm II]]. He refused to return Alsace-Lorraine to the newly revived Kingdom of France and their British allies, which precipitated the Second Great War in Europe. He authorised the destruction of several targets with superbombs, including [[Petrograd]], [[Paris]] as well as [[London]], [[Norwich]] and [[Brighton]] in a deadly triple strike that crippled Britain into defeat. After the war, he entered into a treaty with the new US President [[Thomas E. Dewey]] to police the world and prevent further development of superbombs.\n\nThis character may be the center of a substantial mistake on Turtledove's part. Upon his ascension at the end of [[American Empire: The Victorious Opposition|''The Victorious Opposition'']], he is announced as \"Friedrich I of Germany and Friedrich Wilhelm V of Prussia.\" If this character is indeed the historical figure Wilhelm, Crown Prince of Germany, then he would have reigned as Wilhelm III. While the Crown Prince's first name was Friedrich, even if he chose to call himself that upon his ascension, or, if the character is meant to be the fictional son of Wilhelm II of Germany, he could not have been Friedrich I, but would in fact have been Friedrich IV. There also does not appear to have been a tradition of the German Emperor using a different name in his role as King of Prussia.\n\nAs Turtledove only refers to this character as 'the Kaiser' in the ''Settling Accounts'' series, there are no additional clues available to the reader as to the character's identity.\n\n==Austria-Hungary==\n\n===Charles I of Austria===\n(SA:G)\n\n'''[[Charles I of Austria]]''' still holds the throne of [[Austria-Hungary]] well into the [[Settling Accounts|Second Great War]]. In 1943, he and [[Tsar]] [[Michael II of Russia]] trade public insults as to whose country [[God]] hates more.\n\nTurtledove does not spend much time on the monarchy of Austria-Hungary. Indeed, the only reference to Charles is the one described above. But with Austria victorious at the end of [[World War I]], Charles would not have abdicated as in real history, and so would have avoided dying of [[pneumonia]] in 1922 while living in [[Portugal]].\n\n===Dietl, Eduard===\n(GW:WH)\n\nMajor '''[[Eduard Dietl]]''' of the [[Austro-Hungarian]] army was an observer attached to [[Irving Morrell|Irving Morrell's]] unit during the 1916 campaign in the [[Canadian Rockies]]. While Turtledove made him an Austro-Hungarian officer, real-life Dietl was a member of the German army.\n\n===Ferdinand, Franz===\n(GW:AF)\n\n'''Archduke Franz Ferdinand''' and his wife [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg|Duchess Sophie]] through [[Sarajevo]] were [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|blown up by an assassin's bomb]] on June 28, 1914. In real history, the Archduke and his wife were assassinated on the same date, but by gunshot after failed attempts to throw bombs into their car. After the assassination, Austria-Hungary issued a number of ultimata against [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], which was supported by [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. Austria-Hungary was in turn supported by [[German Empire|Germany]] and the [[United States]]. Russia invoked its alliances with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[French Third Republic|France]], and the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]], and the [[Great War (series)|Great War]] began.\n\nFranz Ferdinand's death inspired [[Arthur McGregor]]'s last failed attempt to assassinate [[George Custer|General George Armstrong Custer]] in 1922.\n\n===Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg===\n(GW:AF)\n\n'''Duchess Sophie''' and her husband Archduke Franz Ferdinand were [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|killed when a bomb was thrown into their car and exploded]], as they rode through the streets of [[Sarajevo]] on 28 June 28, 1914. This act helped to spark the [[Great War (series)|Great War]].\n\n==Denmark==\n\n===Bohr, Niels===\n\nThere is no mention of Denmark taking any part in either of the Great Wars, and it seems to have succeeded in maintaining its neutrality. However, [[Niels Bohr]] is mentioned as having been persuaded by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] to come over to [[German Empire|Germany]] and take part in its [[atomic weapons]] program.\n\n==Russia==\n\n===Michael II, Tsar===\n(AE:VO-SA:RE, SA:ID)\n\n'''[[Michael Alexandrovich]]''' is the Grand Duke (and later [[Emperor]]) of [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. With the [[Russian Revolution|Red Russian Revolt]] smashed, and the tsarist government still in control of a post-Great War Russia, \"Grand Duke Michael\" took the throne as Michael II. He joined [[Settling Accounts|Second Great War]] to help his allies in 1941 to wage war against the [[Central Powers]]. He condemned the [[German Empire|German]] [[atomic bomb]] attack on [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]], the city of which he had escaped prior to the attack, but later was forced to request an armistice from Germany and to relinquish the throne.\n\n===Molotov, Vyacheslav (\"The Hammer\")===\n(AE:CCH)\n\nAlso known as \"The Hammer\", this is '''[[Vyacheslav Molotov]]''' from our world, another Red holdout (in the failed rebellion) in the [[Volga]] area, trying to defeat the Tsarist forces. By 1941, the Tsarist forces have all but defeated the Red Russians.\n\n===Nicholas II, Tsar===\n(GW:AF - GW:B, AE:VO)\n\nIn 1914, when [[Austria-Hungary]] issued a number of ultimata to [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] following the assassination of Franz Ferdinand by a Serb in Sarajevo, '''[[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]''' promised to support the Serbs should they refuse the ultimata. They did, and Russia declared war on Austria-Hungary, which had declared war on Serbia. The Great War followed.\n\nIn 1917, Nicholas found himself facing a [[Russian Revolution|Red revolution]], followed by a protracted [[Russian Civil War|civil war]], which resulted in Russia backing out of the Great War. Ultimately, Nicholas and his supporters triumphed, and Nicholas remained emperor for the remainder of the 1920s. The destruction resulting from the wars left Russia in such a poor state that in 1929 she was forced to suspend payment of a loan to Austria-Hungary. This caused a chain effect that led in turn to the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|worldwide stock market]] crash of that year.\n\nNicholas was succeeded as Tsar by his younger brother [[Michael Alexandrovich|Michael II]] by the early 1930s.\n\n===Stalin, Joseph===\n(AE:CCH)\n\n'''[[Joseph Stalin]]''' is nicknamed \"The Man of Steel\" in this world. The Red Revolution following the Great War failed and Stalin and the \"Hammer\" ([[Vyacheslav Molotov]]) became holdouts in the Volga area near the city of [[Volgograd|Tsaritsyn]] which in our timeline was renamed by him as Stalingrad.\n\n==Ottoman Empire==\n\n===Abdul Mejid II===\n(AE:CCH)\n\n'''[[Abdul Mejid II]]''' became the [[Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] sometime after the Great War. He was responsible for continuing the [[Armenian genocide]] through the 1920s. Despite protests from the United States and [[German Empire|Germany]], the Sultan continued the killings until there were few remaining Armenians left in Turkey.\n\n==Ireland==\n\n===Collins, Michael===\n(AE:BI)\n\nGeneral '''[[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]]''' led a rebellion against the [[British Empire]] during the Great War, supported by the United States and Germany, and became first president of the [[Republic of Ireland]] when this country achieved independence shortly after the war ended. In the early 1920s Collins led the Irish Army against a pro-British Protestant uprising in [[Ulster]] and suppressed it with the help of American and German warships.\n\n==Italy and Vatican City==\n\n===Mussolini, Benito===\n(SA:RE)\n\nAlthough not mentioned by name, Flora Blackford tries to recall the Italian politician who had pledged to make all the trains in his country run on time, but had little public support. The real '''[[Benito Mussolini]]''' claimed to have done this during his rule of [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Italy]]; actually, improvements in the train system predated Mussolini, and the trains were as unpunctual as before.\n\n===Pope Pius XII===\n(SA:G)\n\n'''[[Pope Pius XII|Pius XII]]''' was Pope in this timeline as well as ours. He was criticized for not condemning the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] [[genocide]] of [[Armenians]] or the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] [[pogroms]] against [[Jews]], and it appeared that he likewise did not care about the Freedom Party's killing of the black population of the Confederate States. One character observes that Pius would have spoken out against human rights violations if the group being persecuted consisted mainly of [[Catholic Church|Catholics]]. (Yet this argument is faulty, as the killings were also affecting Catholic Haiti.) The criticism of Pius' failure to condemn human rights violations in this timeline echoes the widely held belief that [[Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust|Pope Pius XII didn't condemn the Holocaust]] in ours.\n\nGiven the passage of eight decades between the point of divergence and this part of the story, there's no guarantee that this Pius XII is Eugenio Pacelli, the man who used that numeral in our timeline. For most of history, Popes simply took their regnal names from a fairly short list. However, the plethora of other historical figures in the series suggests that he is the same.\n\n==Spain==\n\n===Alfonso XIII===\n(AE:VO)\n\n'''[[Alfonso XIII]]''' continues to reign as the King of Spain during the [[Spanish Civil War]], which is fought between the Monarchists (supported by [[German Empire|Germany]]) and the Republicans (supported by Great Britain and the Kingdom of France), as mentioned by Ernest Hemmingway when he discussed with Sylvia Enos the possibility of volunteering to fight in it. Alfonso's reign presumably continued following the Monarchist victory in the conflict.\n\nAlfonso's extended reign may be the result of the Central Powers victory in the Great War which prohibited the rise of [[National Fascist Party|Fascism]], [[National Socialist Workers' Party of Germany|Nazism]] and [[Bolshevism]] and preserved the conservative monarchies of Germany, Austria-Hungary, Turkey and Russia. However, no background is given regarding the civil war.\n\n==Mentioned Historical Characters from Before the [[point of divergence|Change]]==\n\n===Adams, John===\n'''[[John Adams]]''' served as the second [[President of the United States]]. After the [[How Few Remain|War of Secession]], he and the other Northerner [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] such as [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]] were treated more favorably.\n\nDuring the 1900s, Adams's portrait was used on the [[United States five-dollar bill|five dollar bill]].\n\n===Brown, John===\n(AE:BI)\n\nFollowing the U.S. defeat in the Second Mexican War, '''[[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]''' became a national hero. He was not seen so after the War of Secession. Many towns raised memorials to John Brown because of his attacks on the 'slavocrats' in [[Virginia]] (\"He saw the coiled serpent and attacked it!\"), particularly in [[Kansas]].\n\n===Calhoun, John Caldwell===\n(GW:AF) (SA:G)\n\nAlthough '''[[John C. Calhoun]]''' died over a decade before the Confederate States was created by the secession of eleven US states in 1860-61, the secession of the CS's founding states was a direct descendant of his nullification doctrine, and Calhoun was therefore seen as a founding father of the Confederacy along with [[Jefferson Davis]], [[Robert E. Lee]], and even [[George Washington]]. His picture appeared on the [[Confederate States dollar|Confederate dollar bill]], for example. Naturally, the U.S. felt differently about Calhoun.\n\nThe towns of [[Calhoun, Kentucky]] and [[Calhoun, Georgia]] were named in Calhoun's honor in this timeline. (In our timeline, only the Georgia town was unquestionably named in honor of Calhoun. The Kentucky town [[Calhoun, Kentucky#History|had several names]] before being incorporated in 1852, after Calhoun's OTL death in 1850, as ''Calhoon'', honoring Kentucky congressman [[John Calhoon]]. There is no historic record that definitively states whether the later spelling change to \"Calhoun\" was specifically in honor of John C. Calhoun.)\n\n===Franklin, Benjamin===\nAs a [[Pennsylvania|Pennsylvanian man]], '''[[Benjamin Franklin]]''' remained a favorite Founding Father after the War of Secession along with [[John Adams]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]]. A profile of Franklin's face was printed on stamps issued in American Occupied Canada after the [[Great War (Harry Turtledove)|Great War]].\n\n[[Flora Hamburger]] once quoted Franklin's warning \"Those who would trade essential liberty for a little temporary security deserve neither liberty nor security\" in a floor debate in the House of Representatives\u2014which incidentally met in [[Independence Hall]].\n\nFormer president [[Abraham Lincoln]] also quoted Franklin to his host when he visited [[Salt Lake City]] in 1881.\n\n===Jefferson, Thomas===\n'''[[Thomas Jefferson]]''' was the third [[President of the United States]]. Following the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]], Thomas Jefferson's status as a [[Virginia]]n (and more substantively, his insistence on a weak central government) tarnished his memory considerably in the United States. Northern Founding Fathers such as [[John Adams]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], and [[Alexander Hamilton]] were viewed much more favorably.\n\n===Madison, James===\n(SA:ID)\n\nDespite his contributions to the [[Federalist paper]]s with [[Alexander Hamilton]], '''[[James Madison]]''' later developed anti-Federalist sentiments and allied himself with Hamilton's archrival, [[Thomas Jefferson]]. For this reason as well as his Virginian heritage, Madison was generally remembered unfavorably in the version of US history advanced under the Remembrance tradition.\n\nIn 1944, many in the U.S. presumed that Cassius Madison, the man who killed [[Jake Featherston]], had taken his surname to honor the fourth President. In fact Cassius had taken the surname from the [[Madison, Georgia|Georgia town]] nearest to where he'd gunned Featherston down. He had never even heard of President Madison before his tour of the U.S.\n\n===Monroe, James===\n(HFR)\n\nDespite being from [[Virginia]] (a trait which other presidents and [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] such as [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]], and even [[George Washington]] to being remembered in a mixed or negative light by US historians after the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]]), '''[[James Monroe]]''' was looked on kindly in US history books for his attempt to promote U.S. security and international prestige with the [[Monroe Doctrine]]\u2014a doctrine which was eviscerated in 1862 when, thanks to the Confederate States, the U.S. was powerless to prevent [[Second French Empire|France]] from installing [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] as the [[Emperor of Mexico]].\n\n===Napoleon===\n(HFR)\n\n'''[[Napoleon]]''' had been a military genius, achieving an almost mythological stature in the eyes of the world. All those who were masters on the battlefield were often compared to him. He was also an uncle of [[Napoleon III]] who, in turn, was the Emperor of [[Second French Empire|France]] from 1852 to 1870.\n\nOnly in [[German Empire|Germany]] was he not admired as his victory over [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] was remembered. In the aftermath of France's defeat in the [[Great War (Harry Turtledove)|Great War]], this made him even more of a hero to the people of France.\n\nDuring his youth, US President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] counted Napoleon as one of his personal heroes, along with [[George Washington]] and [[Zachary Taylor]].\n\nIn 1881, [[Alfred von Schlieffen]] noted that Kaiser [[Wilhelm I]] was one of the last surviving men to have fought under Napoleon during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\n===Polk, James Knox===\n(SA:ID)\n\n'''[[James Knox Polk]]''' had served as the eleventh President of the United States. He was born in what became [[Pineville, North Carolina]]. A monument erected on the spot of his birth was site of the 1944 meeting between U.S. General [[Irving Morrell]] and [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate President]] [[Don Partridge]] at which Partridge signed away Confederate sovereignty and ended the [[Settling Accounts|Second Great War]]. Both men deemed it a fit location for the meeting because Polk had been President before the United States was divided by the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]].\n\n===Taylor, Zachary===\n(HFR)\n\nDespite his southern roots, '''[[Zachary Taylor]]''' was appreciated in the United States for his military success during the [[Mexican\u2013American War|First Mexican War]] (the last which the United States would see until the [[Great War (series)|Great War]]).\n\nIn his youth, Theodore Roosevelt was a great admirer of Taylor's, viewing him as a conqueror and leader ranking with [[George Washington]] and [[Napoleon]].\n\n===Vegetius===\n(GW:AF)\n\nMajor General William Dudley Foulke gives a copy of his translation of the writings of '''[[Vegetius]]''' to Major Irving Morrell when General Foulke detaches Morrell for assignment to the U.S. General Staff.\n\n===Washington, George===\nAs a military hero and the first President of the United States, '''[[George Washington]]''' was universally revered as a major Founding Father and one of the most memorable presidents in American history. Also after it broke into two mutually antagonistic nations, U.S. historians continued to so regard Washington, alongside Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt as the most memorable of presidents.\n\nBefore 1920, the Confederacy esteemed Washington as a Founding Father, but generally preferred their own founding fathers such as [[John C. Calhoun]], [[Jefferson Davis]], and [[Robert E. Lee]]. In 1914, then-President [[Woodrow Wilson]] invoked George Washington in his speech asking for Congress for a declaration of war against the U.S. while speaking in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].\n\nIn the Union, however, Washington was remembered on mixed terms. The general public did not always remember kindly. Washington came from [[Virginia]], and after the War of Secession his popularity in the U.S. suffered because of it - as did that of Thomas Jefferson and [[James Madison]]. Northern people in general preferred to remember Northern Founding Fathers such as John Adams, Alexander Hamilton and Benjamin Franklin (whose picture appeared on stamps issued by the U.S. occupation authorities in Canada). Despite this, the U.S. Government would rebuild the [[Washington Monument]] after it was destroyed during the [[Great War (Harry Turtledove)|Great War]]. As a young man, Theodore Roosevelt admired Washington as a great leader along with [[Zachary Taylor]] and [[Napoleon]].\n\nThe Freedom Party in its earliest phase, while still under [[Anthony Dresser]], used George Washington's picture as an emblem, with the slogan \"We need a New Revolution\". [[Jake Featherston]], who considered Washington to have \"sold out the South to the damnyankees\" stopped that custom when he took over the party. Many Confederates did view Washington with some suspicion in the years after the Great War, but still thought of him as a Virginian first, and President of the United States second. Washington University in [[Lexington, Virginia]], home of the Confederacy's effort to build a [[Nuclear bomb|superbomb]], retained its name, and the statue of Washington that stood in Richmond survived both Great Wars.\n\n===Webster, Daniel===\n(GW:B)\n\nAs a northern abolitionist, '''[[Daniel Webster]]''' became a hero to the United States during the Remembrance era between the [[Second Mexican War]] and the [[Great War (series)|Great War]]. His image was on the [[Quarter (United States coin)|U.S. quarter]]. In the Confederate States, he was vilified for thwarting the interests of the ante-bellum South.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Fictional characters in the Southern Victory Series]]\n* [[Institutions in the Southern Victory Series]]\n* [[Southern Victory Series]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Harry Turtledove}}\n\n[[Category:Alternate history characters]]\n[[Category:Southern Victory Series]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Humphrey Bogart]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of John Wilkes Booth]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Mark Twain]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of George Armstrong Custer]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Calvin Coolidge]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Clarence Darrow]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of Frederick Douglass]]\n[[Category:Cultural depictions of W.

This was the first feature film role for star [[James Naughton]], who portrays a [[stock broker]] whose new jogging hobby turns into an obsession to excel at [[long distance running]], straining his career and his relationship with his wife ([[Lindsay Wagner]]).\n\nThe film is Shebib's fourth feature. Commercially unsuccessful, reviews of ''Second Wind'' were mixed, tending to praise the cinematography and acting, but usually faulting the script. ''Second Wind'' won a [[Canadian Society of Cinematographers]] award and two [[Canadian Screen Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nRoger Mathieson ([[James Naughton]]) is a 30-year-old stockbroker for whom everything has come easily. One day, he sees a TV report about a 26-year's old running champion and listens intently to remarks from that athlete's coach. Inspired, Mathieson begins jogging, soon discovering he's not in great shape\u2014yet Mathieson persists, fascinated by the notion of trying something difficult for the first time in his life. He trains obsessively to be a winner. This creates friction with his wife, Linda ([[Lindsay Wagner]]), who does not understand why her husband prefers spending time alone to spending time with her.

Walsh hails the direction, the script, the cinematography and especially the cast, who are \"little-known but solidly professional performers who put it across to near perfection\", reserving particular praise for Naughton. \"Shebib provides him with top direction and solid support in all departments. Cameraman Reginald Morris\u2019s cinematography is slick and sophisticated. Hagood Hardy\u2019s inspired musical score knows just when to shut up and when to come on strong.\" And writer Hal Ackerman \"skillfully steers a course between plot excesses and banality\".<ref name=\"Walsh\" /> Six years later, Walsh reaffirmed that ''Second Wind'' was \"a finely-wrought film\" and considered it \"the precursor\" of films such as ''[[Personal Best (film)|Personal Best]]'' (1982) and ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' (1981).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Walsh |first1=Michael |title=Secret too good to keep |url=http://reelingback.com/articles/secret_too_good_to_keep |website=Reeling Back |accessdate=28 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nClive Denton, while less effusive, nevertheless also praised the film for its music, cinematography and direction, calling the script \"well-structured\", and \"often sharp and witty\", though he felt there was some \"sketchiness\" to the family relationship, saying the script is \"below its best level\" with the wife and the son seems like a \"perky little visitor\" rather than their own child.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Denton |first1=Clive |title=Don Shebib's Second Wind |journal=Cinema Canada |date=April 1976 |pages= 53\u201354 |url=http://cinemacanada.athabascau.ca/index.php/cinema/article/viewFile/547/619 |accessdate=22 December 2018}}</ref> [[Marni Jackson]] thought the story was \"a good idea\" and called the film \"dutifully pretty,\" but called the characters \"so diaphanous you can see daylight through them,\" concluding the project suffered from a low budget, \"which says more about the Canadian film-making climate than Shebib.\"<ref name=\"Jackson\" /> Maurice \u00c9lia echoed many of Jackson's impressions: the story itself is quite original and a source of inspiration in some sense, and, for the first time (on the screen or off), Toronto actually looks good (perhaps to the point of exaggeration).<ref name=\"Elia\" /> The film begins well, but loses its way due to an ineptly written script littered with the kind of dialogue which undermines the credibility of the supporting characters: Paula is a sketch at best and the couple's son barely exists at all; even Lindsay Wagner's character is effectively a secondary character made up of unacceptable rejoinders.<ref name=\"Elia\" />\n\nJohn Reeves said that ''Second Wind'' is well filmed and acted, but likewise faulted the script as unbelievable: the film does not accurately show the realities of training for competition, and thereby relegates itself to the realm of [[melodrama]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Reeves |first1=John |title=The soup opera route |journal=Cinema Canada |date=May 1976 |issue= 28 |pages= 22\u201323}}</ref> ''[[TV Guide]]'' gave the film a rating of 2 stars out of 5, calling it an \"innocuous saga,\" and faulting it for not explaining why the protagonist \"refuses to explain the character of his obsession to his wife.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Second Wind |url=https://www.tvguide.com/movies/second-wind/review/117081/ |website=TV Guide |accessdate=21 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Retrospective====\nPeter Hanson describes ''Second Wind'' as \"amiably predictable\", a kind of cinematic \"comfort food\", made when \"small movies about the everyday lives of ordinary people were made regularly, even if those pictures sometimes emerged from the fringes of the industry\".<ref name=\"Hanson\">{{cite web |last1=Hanson |first1=Peter |title=Second Wind (1976) |url=http://every70smovie.blogspot.com/2018/02/second-wind-1976.html |website=Every 70's Movie |accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref>  The characters are \"drawn fairly well\" (Hanson notes that Hal Ackerman went on to become a popular screenwriting teacher at [[UCLA]]'s film school), \"and some of the dialogue clicks, especially passages of sarcastic banter.\"<blockquote>More importantly, the overall narrative has a pleasing shape, fully exploring Roger's dalliance with athletic endeavor. Therefore, fretting that the picture lacks surprise somewhat misses the point, since the focus is Roger testing his limits. Naughton, never the deepest of players, lends likeability and sincerity, while Wagner mostly runs her fingers through her hair.

This was the first feature film role for star [[James Naughton]], who portrays a [[stock broker]] whose new jogging hobby turns into an obsession to excel at [[long distance running]], straining his career and his relationship with his wife ([[Lindsay Wagner]]).\n\nThe film is Shebib's fourth feature. Commercially unsuccessful, reviews of ''Second Wind'' were mixed, tending to praise the cinematography and acting, but usually faulting the script. ''Second Wind'' won a [[Canadian Society of Cinematographers]] award and two [[Canadian Screen Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nRoger Mathieson ([[James Naughton]]) is a 30-year-old stockbroker for whom everything has come easily. One day, he sees a TV report about a 26-year's old running champion and listens intently to remarks from that athlete's coach. Inspired, Mathieson begins jogging, soon discovering he's not in great shape\u2014yet Mathieson persists, fascinated by the notion of trying something difficult for the first time in his life. He trains obsessively to be a winner. This creates friction with his wife, Linda ([[Lindsay Wagner]]), who does not understand why her husband prefers spending time alone to spending time with her. His new hobby also creates problems at work, distracted when he should be focused on a major deal, allowing an ambitious coworker to usurp his stature as the firm's golden boy. As if that were not enough, an attractive woman named Paula ([[Tedde Moore]]) hits on him one day while he is out jogging, then tries to seduce him, testing his fidelity to his long-suffering wife. It's almost too late for his marriage by the time he learns that he's been risking \"the right things in the wrong place.\"<ref name=\"Jackson\" />\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[James Naughton]] as Roger Mathieson\n*[[Lindsay Wagner]] as Linda Mathieson\n* [[Ken Pogue|Kenneth Pogue]] as Pete\n* [[Tedde Moore]] as Paula\n* Tom Harvey as Frank\n* [[Louis Del Grande]] as Howie\n* [[Gerard Parkes]] as Packard\n* [[Jonathan Welsh]] as Simon\n* [[Cec Linder]] as Graham\n* Allan Levson as Kevin\n* Vivian Reis as Winnie\n* Robert Goodier as broker\n* Mike Hurley as runner\n* Robyn Jaffe as Rodger's secretary\n* Robert Slee as broker\n* John D.

Walsh hails the direction, the script, the cinematography and especially the cast, who are \"little-known but solidly professional performers who put it across to near perfection\", reserving particular praise for Naughton. \"Shebib provides him with top direction and solid support in all departments. Cameraman Reginald Morris\u2019s cinematography is slick and sophisticated. Hagood Hardy\u2019s inspired musical score knows just when to shut up and when to come on strong.\" And writer Hal Ackerman \"skillfully steers a course between plot excesses and banality\".<ref name=\"Walsh\" /> Six years later, Walsh reaffirmed that ''Second Wind'' was \"a finely-wrought film\" and considered it \"the precursor\" of films such as ''[[Personal Best (film)|Personal Best]]'' (1982) and ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' (1981).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Walsh |first1=Michael |title=Secret too good to keep |url=http://reelingback.com/articles/secret_too_good_to_keep |website=Reeling Back |accessdate=28 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nClive Denton, while less effusive, nevertheless also praised the film for its music, cinematography and direction, calling the script \"well-structured\", and \"often sharp and witty\", though he felt there was some \"sketchiness\" to the family relationship, saying the script is \"below its best level\" with the wife and the son seems like a \"perky little visitor\" rather than their own child.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Denton |first1=Clive |title=Don Shebib's Second Wind |journal=Cinema Canada |date=April 1976 |pages= 53\u201354 |url=http://cinemacanada.athabascau.ca/index.php/cinema/article/viewFile/547/619 |accessdate=22 December 2018}}</ref> [[Marni Jackson]] thought the story was \"a good idea\" and called the film \"dutifully pretty,\" but called the characters \"so diaphanous you can see daylight through them,\" concluding the project suffered from a low budget, \"which says more about the Canadian film-making climate than Shebib.\"<ref name=\"Jackson\" /> Maurice \u00c9lia echoed many of Jackson's impressions: the story itself is quite original and a source of inspiration in some sense, and, for the first time (on the screen or off), Toronto actually looks good (perhaps to the point of exaggeration).<ref name=\"Elia\" /> The film begins well, but loses its way due to an ineptly written script littered with the kind of dialogue which undermines the credibility of the supporting characters: Paula is a sketch at best and the couple's son barely exists at all; even Lindsay Wagner's character is effectively a secondary character made up of unacceptable rejoinders.<ref name=\"Elia\" />\n\nJohn Reeves said that ''Second Wind'' is well filmed and acted, but likewise faulted the script as unbelievable: the film does not accurately show the realities of training for competition, and thereby relegates itself to the realm of [[melodrama]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Reeves |first1=John |title=The soup opera route |journal=Cinema Canada |date=May 1976 |issue= 28 |pages= 22\u201323}}</ref> ''[[TV Guide]]'' gave the film a rating of 2 stars out of 5, calling it an \"innocuous saga,\" and faulting it for not explaining why the protagonist \"refuses to explain the character of his obsession to his wife.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Second Wind |url=https://www.tvguide.com/movies/second-wind/review/117081/ |website=TV Guide |accessdate=21 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Retrospective====\nPeter Hanson describes ''Second Wind'' as \"amiably predictable\", a kind of cinematic \"comfort food\", made when \"small movies about the everyday lives of ordinary people were made regularly, even if those pictures sometimes emerged from the fringes of the industry\".<ref name=\"Hanson\">{{cite web |last1=Hanson |first1=Peter |title=Second Wind (1976) |url=http://every70smovie.blogspot.com/2018/02/second-wind-1976.html |website=Every 70's Movie |accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref>  The characters are \"drawn fairly well\" (Hanson notes that Hal Ackerman went on to become a popular screenwriting teacher at [[UCLA]]'s film school), \"and some of the dialogue clicks, especially passages of sarcastic banter.\"<blockquote>More importantly, the overall narrative has a pleasing shape, fully exploring Roger's dalliance with athletic endeavor. Therefore, fretting that the picture lacks surprise somewhat misses the point, since the focus is Roger testing his limits. Naughton, never the deepest of players, lends likeability and sincerity, while Wagner mostly runs her fingers through her hair.

{"title_page": "History of the Kansas City Chiefs", "text_new": "{{short description|Sports team history}}\n[[File:Kansas City Chiefs wordmark.svg|right|200px]]\nThe following is a detailed '''history of the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]''', a professional [[American football]] franchise that began play in 1960 as the '''Dallas Texans'''. The team was a charter member of the [[American Football League]] (AFL), and now is currently part of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) (they are not associated with an earlier [[Dallas Texans (NFL)|Dallas Texans]] NFL team that only played for one season in 1952).\n\nThe Texans won the AFL Championship in 1962, and the team relocated to [[Kansas City, Missouri]], the following year. In 1966, the Chiefs won their second AFL title and appeared in the [[Super Bowl I|inaugural AFL-NFL World Championship game]]. In 1969, the Chiefs won the final AFL title and went on to defeat the NFL's [[Spread betting|heavily favored]] [[Minnesota Vikings]] in [[Super Bowl IV]]. The Texans/Chiefs were the most victorious franchise in AFL history, compiling an 87\u201348\u20135 record from 1960 to 1969. They won the Super Bowl in January 1970, and February 2, 2020, at 09:12 p.m. Central.\n\n==AFL origins==\n{{details|topic=more information on the AFL's origins|American Football League}}\nIn 1959, [[Lamar Hunt]], son of oil [[tycoon]] [[H. L. Hunt]], began discussions with other businessmen in establishing an American football organization that would rival that of the [[National Football League]]. Since as early as 1958, Hunt had the interest of purchasing an NFL franchise and moving them to [[Dallas, Texas]]. His desire to secure a professional football franchise was further heightened after watching the historic [[1958 NFL Championship Game]] between the [[1958 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]] and the [[1958 New York Giants season|New York Giants]]. The team that Hunt was most interested in buying was the [[Chicago Cardinals (NFL, 1920\u201359)|Chicago Cardinals]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History AFL\">[http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/ Kansas City Chiefs History AFL Origins\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205213037/http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/ |date=2007-02-05 }}</ref>\n\nThe NFL convinced Hunt to contact Cardinals owner [[Violet Bidwill Wolfner]], and her husband Walter Wolfner eventually agreed to sell Hunt 20 percent of the Cardinals franchise. Hunt declined the opportunity. He then conceived the concept of forming a second league. \"Why wouldn't a second league work\", Hunt recalled. \"There was an [[American League|American]] and [[National League]] in baseball, why not football?\" Hunt contacted several other individuals who had expressed interest in the Cardinals franchise\u2014[[Bud Adams]], [[Bob Howsam]], [[Max Winter]] and Bill Boyer\u2014and gauged their interest in forming a second league.<ref name=\"Chiefs History AFL\"/>\n\nOn August 14, the first meeting of the new league was held in [[Chicago]]. Charter memberships were issued to six original cities \u2014 Dallas, [[New York Jets|New York]], [[Houston Oilers|Houston]], [[Denver Broncos|Denver]], [[Los Angeles Chargers|Los Angeles]] and [[Minnesota Vikings|Minneapolis]]. The league was officially christened the American Football League on August 22. [[Ralph Wilson]] was extended the league's [[Buffalo Bills|seventh franchise]] on October 28 and [[Billy Sullivan (American football)|Billy Sullivan]] became the league's [[New England Patriots|eighth team]]'s owner on November 22. Minneapolis withdrew its franchise from the AFL in November after receiving an offer for a team in the NFL,<ref name=\"Chiefs History AFL\"/> and [[Oakland, California]] instead joined the AFL as the [[Oakland Raiders]].\n\n===Early years in Dallas===\n[[File:Swink fleer 1960.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Jim Swink]] on a [[Fleer]] [[American Football Card|football card]] of 1960]]\nFor the [[1960 Dallas Texans season|Texans' inaugural season]], team owner Lamar Hunt pursued both legendary [[University of Oklahoma]] coach [[Bud Wilkinson]] and [[New York Giants]] defensive assistant [[Tom Landry]] to lead his Texans franchise. Wilkinson opted to stay at Oklahoma, while Landry was destined to coach the NFL's franchise in Dallas. In mid-December 1959 Hunt settled on a relatively unknown assistant coach from the [[Miami Hurricanes football|University of Miami]], [[Hank Stram]]. \"One of the biggest reasons I hired Hank was that he really wanted the job\", Hunt explained. \"It turned out to be a very lucky selection on my part.\"<ref name=\"Chiefs History AFL\"/>\n\nThe Texans were very fortunate to have [[Don Klosterman (American football)|Don Klosterman]] as their head talent man. Klosterman had a penchant for luring star talent away from the NFL, and for finding talent otherwise undiscovered.\n\nReserved seats at the [[Cotton Bowl (stadium)|Cotton Bowl]] cost [[United States Dollars|USD $4]], general admission $2 and high school students paid 90\u00a2 (90 cents) that initial season. [[Don Rossi]] served as the team's [[General Manager (American football)|General Manager]] until November when he was succeeded by [[Jack Steadman]]. The team was headquartered in the [[Mercantile National Bank Building]]. The AFL was also headquartered in Dallas.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nThe Texans conducted their inaugural training camp at the [[New Mexico Military Institute]] in [[Roswell, New Mexico]]. The club embarked on a whirlwind pre-season [[barnstorm (sports)|barnstorm]]ing tour that featured road games in Oakland, [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]], [[Boston]], [[Abilene, Texas|Abilene]] and [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]]. An announced crowd of 51,000 at the Cotton Bowl witnessed a 24\u20133 victory against [[1960 Houston Oilers season|Houston]] on September 2 as the club concluded a perfect 6\u20130 preseason record.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nIn both teams first 1960 season, the Dallas Texans and Dallas Cowboys competed on ticket sales.  For example, according to the book ''Ten-Gallon War'', the Texans offered discounted tickets at department stores and airline offices, free tickets for fill-ups at certain service stations, and even had free tickets \"stuffed inside helium-filled balloons set loose over the city.\"  In competition, the Dallas Cowboys had such promotions as hiring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans for a halftime show.\n<ref name=\"Ten-Gallon War, John Eisenberg, 2012\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=T91c2BFKKzAC&pg=PA118&lpg=PA118&dq=%22stuffed+inside+helium-filled+balloons+set+loose+over+the+city%22&source=bl&ots=WPJ3V-zPFG&sig=Dt2ImLFn2MYlM6e8tO0z6hT1ss0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwik2bHIhtPfAhUrgK0KHUotBGkQ6AEwAHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22stuffed%20inside%20helium-filled%20balloons%20set%20loose%20over%20the%20city%22&f=false Ten-Gallon War: The NFL\u2019s Cowboys, the AFL\u2019s Texans, and the Feud for Dallas's Pro Football Future], John Eisenberg, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2012.</ref>\n\nIn their early years, the Texans had a strong home-state identity with [[quarterback]] [[Cotton Davidson]] from [[Baylor Bears football|Baylor]], [[linebacker]] [[Sherrill Headrick]] from [[TCU Horned Frogs football|TCU]] and [[running back]] [[Abner Haynes]] from [[North Texas Mean Green football|North Texas]]. Haynes led the league with 875 rushing yards and nine TDs, as well as combined net yards (2,100) and punt return average (15.4).<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> The Texans also had a flashy, high-scoring club which finished the year at 8\u20136 as three close losses kept the squad from challenging for the division title. The Texans averaged 24,500 for their home games, the highest average in the league.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> In one attempt to draw more fans to their games, the Texans would offer free tickets to anyone who brought a ticket stub from the previous Friday's high school football game, to counter the NFL Cowboys' playing their home games on Friday night.\n\nIn [[1961 Dallas Texans season|1961]], the Texans and the NFL's Dallas Cowboys both drafted linebacker [[E.J. Holub]] from [[Texas Tech Red Raiders football|Texas Tech]], described by many scouts as \"the best football player in America.\" Holub decided to play for the Texans, joining three future franchise Hall of Famers\u2014[[Jerry Mays (defensive lineman)|Jerry Mays]], [[Fred Arbanas]] and [[Jim Tyrer]]\u2014as part of the club's draft class. The club moved its training camp to Lamar Hunt's [[alma mater]] of [[Southern Methodist University]] and started the regular season at 3\u20131 before hitting a six-game losing skid, the longest such streak of Stram's tenure with the franchise. The Texans rebounded to claim wins in three of its final four contests to finish 6\u20138, marking the club's second straight finish behind the [[1961 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]] in the AFL Western Conference standings.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nIn [[1962 Dallas Texans season|1962]], head coach Hank Stram was named AFL Coach of the Year and running back [[Curtis McClinton]] was named the AFL Rookie of the Year. Haynes became the franchise's first 1,000-yard rusher, concluding the season with 1,049 yards and an AFL-high 13 rushing touchdowns.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nThe Texans clinched their initial AFL Western Division Championship in November and finished with an 11\u20133 regular season record. The team won the [[1962 AFL Championship Game|1962 AFL Championship]] when [[placekicker|kicker]] [[Tommy Brooker]] connected on a 25-yard field goal during the second overtime of the title game, giving the Texans a 20\u201317 victory against the [[1962 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]]. Spanning an elapsed time of 77:54, the game stands as the third-longest contest in pro football history.<ref>Since 1984 the game has been the third-longest professional football game following a triple-overtime [[United States Football League|USFL]] playoff game between the [[Los Angeles Express (USFL)|Los Angeles Express]] and the [[Michigan Panthers]].</ref> Until a [[National Football League Christmas games|Christmas Day]] playoff game in [[1971\u201372 NFL playoffs|1971]] between the [[1971 Kansas City Chiefs season|Chiefs]] and [[1971 Miami Dolphins season|Dolphins]], the game was the longest ever played.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\n===The move to Kansas City===\nThe [[Dallas Cowboys]] joined the NFL as an [[expansion team]] in {{nfly|1960}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=NFL History 1951\u20131960|url=http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1951-1960#1960|publisher=National Football League|date=September 28, 2015|accessdate=September 28, 2015}}</ref> By the end of the 1962 season, it was apparent that Dallas could not support two teams.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> Even though the Texans had been far more successful on the field, Hunt investigated opportunities to move his team elsewhere for the [[1963 Kansas City Chiefs season|1963 season]], including [[Miami]],<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> [[Atlanta]],<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> [[Seattle]] and [[New Orleans]]. Hunt wanted to find a city to which he could commute easily from Dallas, and when he was unable to secure [[Tulane Stadium]] because [[Tulane University|the university]] didn't want its [[Tulane Green Wave football|football program]] to compete with a pro team, he turned to [[Kansas City, Missouri]], where [[Mayor of Kansas City, Missouri|Mayor]] [[H. Roe Bartle]] persuaded him to move to the Midwest.<ref name=\"Chiefs founder\"/>\n\nThe negotiations in Kansas City were conducted in secrecy.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> On several occasions Hunt and Jack Steadman were in Kansas City and met with businessmen, without the general public's knowledge. Bartle introduced Hunt as \"Mr. Lamar\" in all the meetings with other Kansas City businessmen. Steadman was introduced as \"Jack X.\"<ref name=\"Chiefs founder\">Covitz, Randy; Pulliam, Kent. [http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/sports/special_packages/lamar_hunt/16234939.htm Chiefs' founder Lamar Hunt dies] ''Kansas City Star'', 14 December 2006.</ref>\n\nThe support the team received from the Kansas City community before the team announced the move was extraordinary. Hunt made the move dependent upon the ability of Mayor Bartle and the Kansas City community to guarantee him 35,000 in season ticket sales. Hunt had set this number, being that it was the Texans' average attendance at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas. An ambitious campaign took shape to deliver on Bartle's guarantee to Hunt of tripling the season-ticket base the Texans had enjoyed in Dallas. Kansas City's mayor also promised to add 3,000 permanent seats to [[Municipal Stadium (Kansas City)|Municipal Stadium]], as well as 11,000 temporary bleacher seats. Along with Bartle, a number of other prominent Kansas Citians stepped forward to aid in the efforts, putting together more than 1,000 workers to sell season tickets.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nBartle called to his office 20 business leaders and called upon them to form an association later known as \"The Gold Coats\", whose sole objective was to sell and take down payments on the 35,000 season tickets required. \"The Gold Coats\" had to sell season tickets to people without knowing the team name, where it was coming from, who the owner was, which football league they would play in, who the players or coaches were, when the team would play its first game in Kansas City, or where it would play. Hunt gave Bartle a four-month deadline to accomplish the sales. Bartle and \"The Gold Coats\" made good in only 8 weeks. Later, Hunt admitted he was really only hoping for 20,000, for which he still would have moved the franchise. On May 22, Hunt announced he was moving the franchise to [[Kansas City, Missouri]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\">[http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/60s/ Kansas City Chiefs History 1960s\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421185300/http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/60s/ |date=2007-04-21 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:DallasTexansFootballClubNamingContestChiefs.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Football Club Naming Contest Letter from Lamar Hunt]]\nHunt, with a roster replete with players who had played college football in Texas, wanted to maintain a lineage to the team's roots and wanted to name the club the '''Kansas City Texans'''.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\" /> \"The [[Los Angeles Lakers|Lakers]] stayed the Lakers when they moved from Minnesota to California\", he reasoned. \"But Jack Steadman convinced me that wasn't too smart.

The actual total was 10,808, and based on this the car winner was Mr. E. L. Diemler of Kansas City, Missouri, a warehouse manager who got the idea when making out a bill of lading to Chief Freight Lines.<ref>Flanagan, Jeffrey. Name-the-Chiefs winner was inspired by freight. KansasCity.com. 16 Jan 2007.</ref>  Another name also considered at the time for the team was the '''Kansas City Mules'''.<ref name=\"Chiefs founder\" />\n\nThe name, \"Chiefs\" is not only derived from a fan contest, but also from Mayor Bartle, who 35 years prior, founded the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]-based honor society known as ''The [[Tribe of Mic-O-Say]]'' within the [[Scouting in Missouri|Boy Scouts of America]] organization, which earned him the nickname, \"The Chief.\"<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nThe Chiefs moved into Municipal Stadium, located at 22nd and Brooklyn, which opened in 1923 and had 49,002 seats. The Chiefs shared the facilities with the [[Kansas City Athletics]] of [[Major League Baseball]]. The first appearance of the Chiefs in Municipal Stadium attracted just 5,721 fans for a 17\u201313 pre-season victory against [[1963 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo]] on August 9.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nThe Chiefs' inaugural season in Kansas City began with owner Lamar Hunt's trade of starting quarterback [[Cotton Davidson]] to the Oakland Raiders, which landed the number one overall selection in the [[1963 AFL Draft|AFL Draft]] (which they used to select [[Buck Buchanan]]). Ironically, the Raiders would later select [[Gene Upshaw]] in [[1967 AFL Draft|1967]] for the express purpose of blocking Buchanan.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> The Chiefs also selected guard [[Ed Budde]] from [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] with their other first round pick, and [[Bobby Bell]] from [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|Minnesota]] in the seventh round. Buchanan, Budde and Bell all became starters on their way to a combined 526 games with the team and all three of them played their entire careers with the Chiefs.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nTragedy struck the club when rookie running back [[Stone Johnson]], who was a sprinter in the [[1960 Summer Olympics]] in Rome, suffered a fractured vertebra in his neck in a pre-season game against [[1963 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland]] on August 30 in [[Wichita, Kansas]]. He died 10 days later on September 8 and his jersey number 33 was subsequently retired.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> The Chiefs finished their first season in Kansas City with a 5\u20137\u20132 record and failed to reappear in the AFL Championship game for a consecutive year.\n\n===Building a champion, 1964\u20131969===\nIn [[1964 Kansas City Chiefs season|1964]], the Chiefs began the year with a 2\u20131 mark before dropping three consecutive games as several of the team's best players, including [[E.J. Holub]], [[Fred Arbanas]] and [[Johnny Robinson (safety)|Johnny Robinson]] missed numerous games with injuries. Arbanas missed the final two games of the year after undergoing surgery to his left eye, in which he suffered almost total loss of vision. Running back [[Mack Lee Hill]], who signed with the club as a rookie free agent and received a mere $300 signing bonus, entered the starting lineup and earned a spot in the [[AFL All-Star Game]]. The club rounded out the season with two consecutive wins to close the season at 7\u20137, finishing second in the AFL Western Conference behind the [[1964 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]]. An average of just 18,126 fans attended each home game at Municipal Stadium, prompting discussion at the AFL owners' meeting about the Chiefs future in Kansas City.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nFor the [[1965 Kansas City Chiefs season|1965 season]], the Chiefs were once again caught in the middle of the AFL and NFL's bidding wars for college talent. Kansas City made running back [[Gale Sayers]] from the [[Kansas Jayhawks football|University of Kansas]] their first-round draft pick, but Sayers eventually signed with the Bears for less money.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> Running back [[Mack Lee Hill]] suffered torn ligaments in his right knee in the second to last regular season game of the year at Buffalo on December 12. Following what was expected to be a routine surgery on December 14 at Menorah Hospital in Kansas City, Hill died from what was termed \"a sudden and massive [[embolism]].\" Hunt called Hill's death \"the worst shock possible.\" Beginning the following year, the club annually bestowed the Mack Lee Hill Award on its top rookie or first-year performer in Hill's honor. Just days after Hill's unexpected death, the mourning Chiefs defeated the [[Denver Broncos]] on December 19 to finish the year with a 7\u20135\u20132 record.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nIn [[1966 Kansas City Chiefs season|1966]], the Chiefs were beginning to lay the groundwork for a return to the AFL Championship game and eventual dominance in the later years of the AFL. Team owner Lamar Hunt was publicly negotiating with NFL Commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] about a possible merger of the two leagues. [[Defensive end]] [[Aaron Brown (defensive lineman)|Aaron Brown]] was highly coveted by many clubs, including the NFL's [[Pittsburgh Steelers|Steelers]], who intended to select him. The Steelers couldn't locate Brown on draft day since he was already aboard a flight with Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt, who carried out the first mid-air signing in team history. The Chiefs signed [[Heisman Trophy]]-winning running back [[Mike Garrett]] in the 20th round of the [[1966 AFL Draft]]. Garrett went on to earn AFL Rookie of the Year honors for the 1966 season.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nThe Chiefs started the season at 3\u20130. A crowd of 43,885 attended the Chiefs home opener against the defending AFL Champion [[1966 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] on October 2, the largest ever to witness a sports event in Kansas City at the time. The Chiefs dropped a 29\u201314 decision to the Bills, but after the contest, Chiefs coach Hank Stram and Buffalo head coach [[Joe Collier]] negotiated a trade in the middle of the field. Kansas City received placekicker [[Mike Mercer (American football)|Mike Mercer]] for a fifth-round pick. Chiefs quarterback [[Len Dawson]] led the league in passing, while [[Otis Taylor (American football)|Otis Taylor]] became the first 1,000-yard receiver in franchise history, registering 1,297 yards. The Chiefs finished three games in front of Oakland to claim an AFL Western Conference title with an 11\u20132\u20131 record, setting the stage for the franchise's second trip to the [[1966 American Football League Championship Game|AFL Championship Game]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 15 - Willie Davis (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|The Chiefs and the Packers in the first AFL\u2013NFL Championship Game (Super Bowl I)]]\nUsing a dazzling [[I-formation|I-formation offense]] and a smothering defense, the Chiefs claimed a dominating 31\u20137 victory in the AFL title game at Buffalo on [[New Year's Day]], 1967. That victory propelled Kansas City to the [[Super Bowl I|first AFL-NFL World Championship Game]], later known as the [[Super Bowl]]. At the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], the Chiefs met [[Vince Lombardi]]'s powerful [[Green Bay Packers]] of the National Football League on January 15, 1967. The Chiefs played the Packers close for a half, trailing 14\u201310, but Green Bay took control in the final two quarters, winning the game by a score of 35\u201310.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nFor [[1967 Kansas City Chiefs season|1967]], the club's special teams got a boost with the addition of kicker [[Jan Stenerud]], and [[kick returner]] [[Noland Smith|Noland \"Super Gnat\" Smith]]. The Chiefs' first regular season game against an NFL team resulted in a commanding 66\u201324 Chiefs victory against the [[1967 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] at Municipal Stadium on August 23. Injuries again hit the club hard during the regular season as the Chiefs clawed their way to a 9\u20135 record.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nInterest in the team skyrocketed following the team's appearance in the AFL-NFL Championship Game, forcing an increase in [[seating capacity]] at Municipal Stadium from 40,000 to 47,000. In June, [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] voters approved a $43 million bond issue for construction of a sports complex<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> to be completed by 1972. Eastern Jackson County was chosen as the site of the Chiefs and Royals' new stadiums, and groundbreaking ceremonies took place in July with plans calling for a unique \"rolling roof\" design (which was later scrapped).\n\nThe [[1968 Kansas City Chiefs season|1968 Chiefs]] defense allowed a franchise-low 170 points (12.1 ppg). The nucleus of the defensive unit was in its prime, producing six AFL All-Stars, including all three of the squad's linebackers. Offensively, quarterback [[Len Dawson]] led the AFL in passing for the fourth time. The Chiefs began the season with a 7\u20131 record and rattled off five straight victories to close the regular season at 12\u20132, sharing the AFL Western Conference title with the [[1968 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] and setting up a one-game playoff between the two teams. Kansas City lost a 41\u20136 decision at Oakland on December 22 as the Raiders advanced to the [[American Football League playoffs#1968 Championship|1968 AFL Championship Game]] against the [[1968 New York Jets season|New York Jets]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> The loss to Oakland is considered to be the beginning of the [[Chiefs-Raiders rivalry|Chiefs' rivalry with the Raiders]], one of the NFL's most [[National Football League rivalries|bitter feuds]].\n\nThe Chiefs used the momentum they built during the 1968 campaign by posting a perfect 6\u20130 record during pre-season play for [[1969 Kansas City Chiefs season|1969]]. The team began the regular season with four consecutive road games for the only time in team history. After a decisive 27\u20139 win at [[1969 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego]] on September 14, the club posted a 31\u20130 shutout at [[1969 Boston Patriots season|Boston]] on September 21. During the game, quarterback Len Dawson sustained a knee injury which would sideline him for the following two months.\n\nThe once-optimistic picture for the Chiefs went from bad to worse the following week when back-up quarterback [[Jacky Lee (American football)|Jacky Lee]] went down with a broken ankle in a 24\u201319 loss at [[1969 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati]] on September 28. That injury left the team's most crucial position in the hands of second-year quarterback [[Mike Livingston]], who took just five snaps as a rookie in 1968.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> However, Livingston engineered a five-game winning streak, while getting plenty of help from the club's defense. The team's home opener was played in a day-long deluge referred to as a \"frog-strangler\" by Chiefs radio broadcaster [[Bill Grigsby]]. The Chiefs and [[1969 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]] combined for 14 fumbles in a 24\u20130 Kansas City victory on October 12. Len Dawson returned to the starting lineup in a 27\u20133 win against San Diego on November 9 and guided the club to three wins in the season's next four games.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nThe Chiefs defeated the [[1969 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] 31\u201317 on [[NFL Thanksgiving Classic|Thanksgiving Day]]. Trailing 24\u201317 late in the game, Denver attempted an [[onside kick]] that was recovered by linebacker Bobby Bell, who promptly returned that kick for a 53-yard [[touchdown]]. Mike Livingston started the following week against [[1969 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo]] on December 7 for an again-injured Dawson, who returned for the regular season finale at Oakland on December 13. A 10\u20136 loss against the Raiders gave the Chiefs an 11\u20133 record, good for second in the AFC Western Conference behind [[1969 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland]] (12\u20131\u20131).<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | footer = The Chiefs topped the Raiders in the [[1969 American Football League Championship Game|1969 AFL championship game]] (''left'') and went on to defeat the Vikings in Super Bowl IV (''right'').\n | footer_align = left\n | image1 = 1986 Jeno's Pizza - 49 - Robert Holmes.jpg\n | width1 = 140\n | image2 =1986 Jeno's Pizza - 50 - Buck Buchanan and Curley Culp.jpg\n | width2 = 140\n}}\nIn an AFL Divisional Playoff Game at [[1969 New York Jets season|New York]], Kansas City rode its dominating defense which produced a crucial goal-line stand en route to a 13\u20136 win over the [[Super Bowl III|defending Super Bowl champion]] Jets to set up a rematch with the Raiders in the [[1969 AFL Championship|final AFL Championship Game]]. Looking for retribution of the previous losses in the regular season and in the 1968 playoffs, the Chiefs became the league's only three-time champions, defeating the Raiders by a 17\u20137 count at Oakland on January 4, 1970.\n\nDuring the days preceding Kansas City's clash with the [[spread betting|heavily favored]] [[1969 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] of the NFL, unsubstantiated media reports associating Len Dawson with a known gambler hounded the Chiefs quarterback.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Dawson was later revealed to be mistaken for another man with the same last name. The night before Super Bowl IV, [[Ed Sabol]] of [[NFL Films]] approached Vikings coach [[Bud Grant]] about being wired for sound for the game. Grant declined, but Chiefs coach [[Hank Stram]] accepted. As both the Chiefs and the cameras rolled, Stram clamored for his team to run \"65 toss power trap\" and to \"keep matriculating the ball down the field.\"<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Stram became the first-ever coach to be wired for NFL Films, and ironically, as a coach in the rival AFL.\n\nThe Chiefs used the game as a crusade for the American Football League and wore \"AFL-10\" patches honoring the league's 10-year existence. The Chiefs used three field goals from Jan Stenerud and a rushing touchdown from Mike Garrett to take a 16\u20130 halftime lead. A dynamic 46-yard TD pass from Len Dawson to Otis Taylor in the third quarter sealed the victory as Dawson was named the game's [[Super Bowl MVP|Most Valuable Player]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Perhaps the grittiest performance of the day came from [[safety (American football position)|safety]] [[Johnny Robinson (safety)|Johnny Robinson]], who registered two interceptions and a fumble recovery despite playing with three broken ribs. At approximately 5:20 PM, the final seconds ticked off the clock at [[Tulane Stadium]] as the Chiefs were crowned World Champions by claiming a 23\u20137 victory in the final game between the AFL and NFL.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> A victory parade ensued upon the club's triumphant return the following day in [[downtown Kansas City]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> [[Super Bowl IV]] was the last championship won by the Chiefs until [[Super Bowl LIV]],\n\n==Alignment to the NFL==\n\n===Fall from glory, 1970\u20131977===\nFollowing their championship win, the NFL-AFL merger placed the Chiefs in the newly created AFC West division with the Chargers, Raiders, and Broncos. The team traded running back Mike Garrett to San Diego in [[1970 Kansas City Chiefs season|1970]] and replaced him in the lineup with [[Ed Podolak]]. Despite a 44\u201324 win against [[1970 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore]] on September 28 in just the second-ever telecast of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' package, the Chiefs owned a 3\u20133\u20131 record at the season's midpoint. The Chiefs and the [[1970 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] tied a game at 17\u201317 on November 1 following a controversial play from Oakland. The Chiefs were ahead 17\u201314 when Len Dawson apparently sealed the win, running for a first down which would have allowed Kansas City to run out the clock. While on the ground, Dawson was speared by Raiders defensive end [[Ben Davidson]] in an infamous incident that cost the Chiefs a victory and further inflamed the already heated Chiefs-Raiders rivalry.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Wide receiver Otis Taylor retaliated and a bench-clearing brawl ensued. Offsetting penalties were called, nullifying Dawson's first down. The Chiefs were forced to punt and Raiders kicker [[George Blanda]] booted a game-tying field goal with eight seconds remaining. That tie ultimately cost the Chiefs the opportunity to split the AFC West division title with Oakland as Kansas City finished the year with a 7\u20135\u20132 record, while the Raiders went 8\u20134\u20132 and reached the conference championship.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\n{{quote box\n| quote = I always thought that our best team was the peak of our best team, our '71 squad.\n| source = -[[Lamar Hunt]]<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n| align = left\n| width = 30%\n| salign = right\n}}\n\nIn [[1971 Kansas City Chiefs season|1971]], the Chiefs were regarded by many as the finest squad ever assembled by the franchise, including team owner Lamar Hunt. The team featured a franchise record 11 Pro Bowlers. Offensively, wide receiver Otis Taylor led the league with 1,110 receiving yards. In just his third pro season, Ed Podolak surpassed Abner Haynes as the all-time leading rusher in team history. The longstanding linebacking trio of Willie Lanier, Bobby Bell and Jim Lynch was the league's best. The offensive line was headlined by guard Ed Budde and tackle Jim Tyrer, while the defensive front featured a pair of Pro Bowlers in tackles Buck Buchanan and [[Curley Culp]]. Both placekicker Jan Stenerud and punter [[Jerrel Wilson]] represented the squad in the Pro Bowl, as well.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | direction = horizontal\n | footer = The Chiefs defensive tackles Buck Buchanan (''left'') and Curley Culp (''right'') were integral parts of the team's remarkable defensive line in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n | footer_align = right\n | image1 = 1986 Jeno's Pizza - 50 - Buck Buchanan and Curley Culp (Buck Buchanan crop).jpg\n | width1 = 100\n | image2 =1986 Jeno's Pizza - 50 - Buck Buchanan and Curley Culp (Curley Culp crop).jpg\n | width2 = 106\n}}\n\nAfter bolting to a 5\u20131\u20131 start, the club went 5\u20132 during the second half of the season to finish the year at 10\u20133\u20131. A 16\u201314 victory against Oakland on December 12 gave the franchise its initial AFC West title.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> The great promise of the 1971 campaign ended dramatically in [[1971\u201372 NFL playoffs#AFC: Miami Dolphins 27.2C Kansas City Chiefs 24 .282OT.29|the longest game]] in NFL history, an AFC Divisional Playoff Game played on Christmas Day against the [[1971 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]]. It took 82:40<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> to finish the contest, but a 37-yard field goal from Dolphins kicker [[Garo Yepremian]] finally ended this epic as Miami claimed a 27\u201324 double [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]] win in the final football contest played at Kansas City's Municipal Stadium. Chiefs' running back Ed Podolak accounted for 350 combined net yards, a figure that remains an NFL post-season record.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> The baton of power in the AFC was officially passed to the Dolphins, who went on to appear in three consecutive Super Bowls. It would be the Chiefs' last playoff appearance for 15 years, effectively signaling the conclusion of the franchise's glory days.\n\nIn [[1972 Kansas City Chiefs season|1972]], the last original member of the 1960 Dallas Texans team departed when safety [[Johnny Robinson (safety)|Johnny Robinson]] announced his retirement at training camp. Meanwhile, starting quarterback Len Dawson ended speculation about his retirement by signing a two-year contract. Franchise owner Lamar Hunt became the first AFL figure to be inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] on July 29.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nAfter two different construction strikes and a myriad of other delays, [[Arrowhead Stadium]] was officially dedicated on August 12 when the Chiefs registered a 24\u201314 victory against the [[1972 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|St. Louis Cardinals]]. Running back Ed Podolak scored the first touchdown in the facility. Regular season ticket prices for the team's first season at Arrowhead were [[USD]]$8 for box seats and $7 for reserved seating.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nOn September 17, the Chiefs lost a 20\u201310 decision against Miami in the first regular season game at Arrowhead in front of a crowd of 79,829.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> A standing-room-only crowd of 82,094 fans was in attendance for a 27\u201314 victory against [[1972 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland]] on November 5, the largest \"in-house\" attendance total for an NFL contest in Arrowhead's history.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> After a 5\u20133 start, a three-game losing streak effectively eliminated the club from playoff contention, including an embarrassing home loss to the winless Philadelphia Eagles. An 8\u20136 record was good enough for only a second-place finish in the AFC West behind Oakland. Linebacker Willie Lanier became the first Chiefs player to receive the NFL Man of the Year Award in the offseason.\n\n[[File:Kansas City Chiefs at Denver Broncos 1985-12-14 (ticket) (crop).jpg|thumb|left|Dawson pictured later in his career with the Chiefs]]\nFor [[1973 Kansas City Chiefs season|1973]], quarterback Mike Livingston started in a 23\u201313 Opening Day loss against [[1973 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles]], but Len Dawson returned to rally the club for three consecutive wins to get the club off to a 3\u20131 start for a third consecutive year. The aging Len Dawson made his final start of the year in a 23\u201314 loss at [[1973 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo]] on October 29 on ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' and was replaced for the remainder of the year by Livingston, beginning a string of three straight seasons in which both players split time at the position.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Livingston led the club to another three straight wins, putting the team in first place in mid-November with a 6\u20133\u20131 record. A 1\u20132\u20131 ledger over the season's final month ended the club's post-season aspirations as the team finished the year in a second-place tie with [[1973 Denver Broncos season|Denver]] at 7\u20135\u20132. Len Dawson became the second Chiefs player in as many years to win the NFL Man of the Year Award. Following [[Super Bowl VIII]], The [[1974 Pro Bowl|AFC-NFC Pro Bowl]] was held at Arrowhead Stadium on January 20 with the AFC claiming a 15\u201313 win thanks to five field goals from Miami placekicker Garo Yepremian.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nWhile the club's sparkling new facility at Arrowhead Stadium was drawing rave reviews, the Chiefs roster was beginning to show its age in [[1974 Kansas City Chiefs season|1974]]. The result was the team's first losing season in 11 years as the club was unable to string together consecutive victories during the year, a first in franchise history.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Most of the team's starters were advancing in age: Len Dawson was 39, Jim Tyrer was 35, Bobby Bell, Buck Buchanan, and Ed Budde were 34, Dave Hill was 33 and Otis Taylor was 32.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nOne of the year's few bright spots in the 5\u20139 season was cornerback [[Emmitt Thomas]], who led the league with a franchise-record 12 interceptions. The final game of the 1974 campaign marked the final time all five of Kansas City's future Hall of Fame players from the club's AFL championship era took the field together with coach Hank Stram. Including Lamar Hunt and five future Minnesota Vikings Hall of Famers, an amazing total of 12 Hall of Fame inductees were involved in that 1974 season finale game. That 35\u201315 loss against Super Bowl-bound [[1974 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]] provided an anticlimactic conclusion to Hank Stram's illustrious coaching career in Kansas City. Stram, the only head coach in franchise history was relieved of his duties on December 27 after compiling a 124\u201376\u201310 regular season record with the club.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\n[[San Francisco 49ers]] defensive coordinator [[Paul Wiggin]] was named the second head coach in franchise history on January 23, [[1975 Kansas City Chiefs season|1975]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Wiggin inherited the unenviable task of rebuilding a squad whose pool of talent had been largely depleted due to age and a number of ill-considered trades that had left the club devoid of first-round draft choices in [[1973 NFL Draft|1973]] and [[1975 NFL Draft|1975]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> After an 0\u20133 start to the season, Wiggin directed the Chiefs to three straight wins, beginning with a convincing 42\u201310 victory against the [[1975 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]]. The highlight of the season was a 34\u201331 upset win at Dallas on ''Monday Night Football''. The club could not maintain the early success; owning a 5\u20135 record heading into the home stretch of the season, injuries to a number of key players crippled the team. The team dropped its final four contests of the year to finish at 5\u20139 for the second consecutive season. The regular season finale at Oakland marked the final games in the Hall of Fame careers of Len Dawson and Buck Buchanan.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nBy [[1976 Kansas City Chiefs season|1976]], many of the Chiefs' championship players were on their way out of Kansas City. Buck Buchanan announced his retirement in February, while Dawson announced his own departure on May 1.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Off the field, Jack Steadman was promoted to team president and [[Jim Schaaf]] was named general manager in August. On the field, Kansas City's fortunes didn't improve in the second year of the Wiggin regime. The club dropped three straight home games, including a 27\u201317 loss to a [[1976 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] team coached by Stram, before suffering a 50\u201317 setback at [[1976 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo]] on October 3, opening the season at 0\u20134 for the first time in team history.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> The team registered a 3\u20131 record during a successful midseason stretch, but like most of the previous seasons, could not maintain that momentum.\n\nAfter lingering in Len Dawson's shadow for eight seasons, Mike Livingston was firmly entrenched as the team's starting quarterback, becoming the first QB to start every regular season game since Dawson in 1968. Although Livingston played well and rallied the squad for wins in two of the season's final three games, the Chiefs still ended the year with their third consecutive 5\u20139 record.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Running back [[MacArthur Lane]] was the club's top offensive threat, becoming the only player at the time in franchise history to lead the league in receptions (66).\n\nOn the field, the Chiefs suffered their worst season ever in [[1977 Kansas City Chiefs season|1977]], winning just twice and undergoing a mid-season coaching change. Following three consecutive 5\u20139 seasons, the team finished with a league worst 2\u201312 record. An 0\u20135 start doomed the squad with a 44\u20137 loss at Cleveland, where Wiggin starred as a defensive lineman during the Browns' glory days, effectively sealing the coach's fate. Wiggin was relieved of his duties on [[Halloween]], marking the only in-season coaching switch in team history.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Defensive backs coach [[Tom Bettis]] was named interim coach and claimed a 20\u201310 victory against Green Bay in the club's initial contest under his direction, but it was the only victory of his brief head coaching tenure.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nBettis and the remainder of the coaching staff assembled by Wiggin were relieved on December 19, one day after a 21\u201320 loss at Oakland in the regular season finale.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> [[Marv Levy]], the former head coach of the [[Canadian Football League]]'s [[Montreal Alouettes]], was named the fourth head coach in franchise history the following day. The heart and soul of the Chiefs once-vaunted defense departed when Willie Lanier and Jim Lynch retired following the season.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\n===Signs of improvement, 1978\u20131982===\nFor [[1978 Kansas City Chiefs season|1978]], Marv Levy's systematic restocking of a relatively barren defensive roster began with a [[1978 NFL Draft|1978 draft class]] that included defensive end [[Art Still]] and linebacker [[Gary Spani]]. Running back Ed Podolak, who was the club's all-time leading rusher at the time, retired in the offseason on June 15.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nPerhaps Levy's most unconventional tactic in rebuilding the Chiefs was installing the \"[[Wing-T offense]]\". \"It was a situation where we took over a team that had the worst defensive record in the history of the National Football League\", Levy explained. \"We wanted to keep that defense off the field, so we ran the ball 60 times a game.\"<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> The 1978 Chiefs team ran and ran often, posting franchise records with 663 rushing attempts and 2,986 ground yards.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Levy's squad ran the ball a staggering 69 times in a 24\u201323 Opening Day win at Cincinnati on September 3, the most rushing attempts in an NFL contest since [[1948 NFL season|1948]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Five different players had 100-yard rushing games during the year, including running back [[Tony Reed]], who finished the season with 1,053 yards to become the team's first 1,000-yard back since 1967.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Despite the squad's Opening Day success, the club lost 10 of its next 11 games, including a pair of overtime decisions. However, the team showed signs of improvement with the defense recording a 23\u20130 shutout against [[1978 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego]] on November 26 as the club concluded its first 16-game schedule with a 4\u201312 mark.\n\nIn [[1979 Kansas City Chiefs season|1979]], Kansas City owned a pair of picks in the first round of the [[1979 NFL Draft|Draft]], selecting defensive end [[Mike Bell (defensive lineman)|Mike Bell]] and quarterback [[Steve Fuller (football player)|Steve Fuller]]. By the season's third game, Fuller had supplanted Mike Livingston as the club's starter.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nWith Fuller at the helm, the Chiefs owned a 4\u20132 record after six games, but a five-game mid-season losing stretch sullied that effort. Despite finishing fifth in the AFC West for a second straight season, Kansas City's 7\u20139 record was a notable accomplishment considering the fact that the division's other four clubs all posted winning records for a second consecutive season.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> The Chiefs lost a 3\u20130 decision at [[1979 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay]] on December 16 in one of the most water-logged contests in franchise annals. As both clubs struggled to move the ball under monsoon-like conditions, a late, fourth-quarter field goal by the Buccaneers averted the NFL's first scoreless tie since [[1943 NFL season|1943]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nIn [[1980 Kansas City Chiefs season|1980]], the Chiefs selected guard [[Brad Budde]] in the first round of the [[1980 NFL Draft|Draft]], the son of former Chiefs guard Ed Budde, as the team's first-round draft choice, making the Buddes the first father-son combination to become first-round draftees of the same team in NFL history.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> In a then-controversial move on August 26, the Chiefs released placekicker Jan Stenerud, who at the time was club's all-time leading scorer. He was replaced by journeyman [[Nick Lowery]], who had been cut 11 times by eight different teams himself.\n\nAfter enduring an 0\u20134 start, the club rebounded to post a four-game winning streak, starting with a 31\u201317 victory in Oakland, in which Raiders quarterback [[Dan Pastorini]] broke his leg and was replaced by [[Jim Plunkett]], who guided the team to the [[Super Bowl XV]] championship. After Steve Fuller was sidelined with a knee injury late in the season, former Miami 12th-round draft choice [[Bill Kenney]] became the team's starting quarterback. He was so anonymous that when he appeared in that contest, the name on the back of his jersey was inadvertently misspelled \"Kenny.\"<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Kenney went on to lead the club to a 31\u201314 victory against Denver on December 7 in his initial NFL start. The defense continued to evolve as defensive end Art Still and safety [[Gary Barbaro]] became the first Chiefs defensive players to be elected to the Pro Bowl in five seasons. The Chiefs finished the year at 8\u20138, the club's highest victory tally since 1972.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#b0c4de; width:20em;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"I've played against the best\u2014[[O.J.

Second-round draft choice, running back [[Joe Delaney]] electrified the club's offense by rushing for 1,121 yards, a team single-season record at the time. He was named the AFC's Rookie of the Year and became the first running back to represent the franchise in the Pro Bowl.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Delaney registered a 193-yard performance in a 23\u201310 victory against the [[1981 Houston Oilers season|Oilers]] on November 15, the best single-game total ever amassed by a Kansas City rookie.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\nOwning an 8\u20134 record with four games remaining, the Chiefs were poised to make the playoffs for the first time in 10 years. However, a three-game losing streak ended the anticipation. Bill Kenney missed the club's final three contests due to injury as Steve Fuller temporarily reclaimed the starting QB position and guided the club to a 10\u20136 win at Minnesota, in the final contest played at [[Metropolitan Stadium]]. With the Chiefs winning the game, Vikings fans began dismembering the stadium as early as the second half\u2014taking seats, pieces of the scoreboard and even chunks of sod as souvenirs.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> The victory assured the Chiefs of a 9\u20137 record, the club's first winning mark since 1973 as coach Marv Levy increased the club's victory total for a third consecutive year. Inspired by the [[Washington Redskins]]'s \"[[Hail to the Redskins]]\", Levy penned a fight song for the Chiefs (\"Give a Cheer for Kansas City\"), but much like the team's Wing-T offense, the concept never really caught on.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\nIn [[1982 Kansas City Chiefs season|1982]], running back Joe Delaney underwent surgery to repair a detached retina in his eye, a radical procedure at the time.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Optimism abounded at Arrowhead thanks to the club's promising 9\u20137 record from 1981, but swelling labor unrest from NFL players spelled doom for both the Chiefs and Levy in 1982. The Chiefs split their first two games of the year before a 57-day [[1982 NFL strike|strike]] by the [[NFL Players Association]] began at midnight on September 20. The strike concluded on November 17 after six games were canceled and one was rescheduled, but the Chiefs would never recover, dropping four straight games after their return to the field. Center [[Jack Rudnay]], who had been one of the franchise's most durable and decorated offensive performers over the past decade, announced on December 20 that he would retire after the season. Despite wins in two of the season's final three games, the Levy era concluded as the club finished the strike-shortened campaign at 3\u20136.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\n===Unbalanced chemistry, 1983\u20131988===\n\n====1983====\n{{details|1983 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nTo begin 1983, the Chiefs fired head coach Marv Levy on January 4 after compiling a 31\u201342 record. [[Dallas Cowboys]] quarterbacks coach [[John Mackovic]] was named the fifth head coach in team history on February 2. The 39-year-old Mackovic became the youngest individual ever to hold that post for the club.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> The Chiefs held the seventh overall pick in the quarterback-laden [[1983 NFL Draft]] and selected [[Todd Blackledge]]. The five other signal-callers selected in the first round that year included [[John Elway]], [[Jim Kelly]], [[Tony Eason]], [[Ken O'Brien]] and [[Dan Marino]].\n\nTragedy struck the club on June 29 when Joe Delaney [[drowned]] trying to save the lives of three youngsters in [[Monroe, Louisiana]]. Delaney was [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] awarded the Presidential Citizen's Medal by [[Ronald Reagan]] on July 13.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Linebacker Bobby Bell became the first Chiefs player to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on July 30,<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> providing some solace for the mourning Chiefs fan base following Joe Delaney's death.\n\nWith Kenney and Blackledge both on the roster, starting QB Steve Fuller was traded to the [[Los Angeles Rams]] on August 19. Kenney earned a Pro Bowl berth after racking up a franchise-record 4,348 passing yards, while wide receiver [[Carlos Carson]] hauled in 80 passes for 1,351 yards.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Despite the team's high-flying passing game, head coach John Mackovic had trouble finding a suitable replacement for Joe Delaney and the running back position. The highest scoring contest in franchise history took place as the Chiefs and [[1983 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] combined for 99 points in a wild, 51\u201348 overtime loss at the [[Kingdome]]. A meager crowd of 11,377 attended the club's season-ending 48\u201317 win against [[1983 Denver Broncos season|Denver]] on December 18, the smallest attendance figure ever for a Chiefs game at Arrowhead as the club finished the year at 6\u201310.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\n====1984====\n{{details|1984 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nPro Bowl safety [[Gary Barbaro]] became the most notable Chiefs player to defect to the rival [[United States Football League]], signing with the [[New Jersey Generals]] on February 2 after sitting out the entire 1983 campaign in a contract dispute.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Barbaro's departure and the trade of cornerback [[Gary Green (American football)|Gary Green]] began a youth movement that produced the most vaunted secondary in team history. Cornerbacks [[Kevin Ross (American football)|Kevin Ross]] and [[Albert Lewis (American football)|Albert Lewis]], and safeties [[Deron Cherry]] and [[Lloyd Burruss]] accounted for a combined 13 Pro Bowl appearances for the Chiefs<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> in the years to come.\n\nAll-America defensive tackle [[Bill Maas]] and offensive tackle [[John Alt]] were both selected in the first round of the [[1984 NFL Draft]]. Maas was named [[NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year]], while Alt eventually became the cornerstone of the club's offensive line later in the decade. Kansas City's defense registered a team-record 11.0 sacks in a 10\u20136 win against Cleveland on September 30, coming one sack shy of the NFL single-game record.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\nQuarterback Bill Kenney suffered a broken thumb during the preseason and was sidelined until the season's seventh week. Second year back-up QB Todd Blackledge opened the first six contests of the season and had the club at 3\u20133. Kenney returned to the starting lineup against the [[1984 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] on October 21, but inconsistency marked the rest of the season as the club dropped four of first five contests after his return. However, the team rattled off three consecutive wins to conclude the year at 8\u20138.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\n====1985====\n[[File:Kansas City Chiefs at Denver Broncos 1985-12-14 (ticket).jpg|thumb|right|100px|A ticket for a 1985 game between the Chiefs and the Denver Broncos]]\n{{details|1985 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nThe Chiefs got off to a flying start in [[1985 NFL season|1985]] with a 47\u201327 win at [[1985 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans]], while safety [[Deron Cherry]] tied an NFL record by registering four interceptions in a 28\u20137 win against [[1985 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle]] on September 29 as the club boasted a 3\u20131 record four games into the season.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> The club was then confronted with a seven-game losing streak that wasn't snapped until QB Todd Blackledge was installed as the starter against [[1985 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis]] on November 24. The team rebounded to win three of its final five contests of the year with Blackledge under center, further inflaming a quarterback controversy that continued into the 1986 season.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\nOne of the few remaining bright spots in a disappointing 6\u201310 season came in the regular season finale against [[1985 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego]] when wide receiver [[Stephone Paige]] set an NFL record with 309 receiving yards in a 38\u201334 win, breaking the previous mark of 303 yards set by [[Cleveland Browns|Cleveland's]] [[Jim Benton (American football)|Jim Benton]] in [[1945 NFL season|1945]]. Paige's mark was subsequently surpassed by a 336-yard effort by [[Flipper Anderson]] (L.A.

On the field, the pieces started coming together for head coach John Mackovic. His offense displayed plenty of scoring punch, while the club's defense and special teams became increasingly effective.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> With the team sitting at 3\u20133, Bill Kenney replaced Todd Blackledge for the second half of the season in a game against San Diego,<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> guiding the club to a 42\u201341 victory. That win was the first of four consecutive triumphs with Kenney at the helm, the club's longest winning streak since 1980. Poised with a 7\u20133 record after 10 games, three straight losses in November put the Chiefs playoff chances in jeopardy. Two December wins gave Kansas City a 9\u20136 mark, putting the Chiefs on the verge of their first postseason berth in 15 years.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\nThe defining moment of the season came in the regular season finale at [[1986 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh]] on December 21.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Despite being outgained in total yardage by a 515-to-171-yard margin, the Chiefs were able to notch a 24\u201319 victory as all of the team's points came via special teams on a blocked punt return, a field goal, a kickoff return and a blocked field goal return.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> With a 10\u20136 record the Chiefs earned an AFC Wild Card berth, winning a tiebreaker with Seattle. Bill Kenney was injured in the fourth quarter of the Steelers contest, meaning Todd Blackledge would draw the starting assignment for the club's first playoff contest since 1971, a 35\u201315 loss at [[1985 New York Jets season|New York]].\n\n====1987====\n{{details|1987 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nOne of the most tumultuous weeks in franchise history took place following the club's playoff loss against the Jets. Assistant head coach and special teams coach [[Frank Gansz]], resigned his position on January 7 in order to pursue opportunities as an NFL offensive coordinator.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> The following day, the Chiefs announced in an impromptu press conference that John Mackovic was relieved of his duties as head coach on January 8. A popular figure among Chiefs players, Gansz was reinstated on January 10 and was named the sixth head coach in franchise history.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\nFormer quarterback Len Dawson became the third Chiefs player inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on August 8,<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> while injuries forced the retirement of the club's all-time leading tackler Gary Spani. A duo of rookies made a splash in a 20\u201313 win on Opening Day against San Diego as running back [[Paul Palmer (American football)|Paul Palmer]] returned a kickoff for a TD and [[Christian Okoye]] dashed for 105 yards.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> A 24-day players strike began on September 22, effectively canceling the club's contest against [[1987 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Replacement players participated in games for the next three weeks. Much like Marv Levy five years earlier, Gansz's grip on the club's coaching reins was crippled by the labor unrest.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\nKansas City's replacement squad consisted primarily of players cut in training camp. One of the few bright spots among this motley crew was running back Jitter Fields, who remained on the active roster following the strike.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> The Chiefs strike squad received an ominous welcome in Los Angeles when in the early morning hours of October 4, the day prior to a contest against the Raiders, an earthquake rattled [[Southern California]]. The shaken Chiefs lost a 35\u201317 decision later that day. The low point of the year came the following week at Miami in the first regular season game played at what then was known as [[Joe Robbie Stadium]]. Chiefs replacement QB [[Matt Stevens (quarterback)|Matt Stevens]] was injured early in the contest, forcing into duty QB [[Alex Espinoza]], a player who had never taken an NFL snap. The result was a 42\u20130 Dolphins victory, setting the stage for an 0\u20133 performance by Kansas City's replacement unit, giving the Chiefs a 1\u20134 record before the club's regular roster returned at San Diego on October 25.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Five straight losses followed, giving the Chiefs a team-record nine-game losing skid. For the only time in team history, five different players started games at quarterback for the club.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Behind Kenney, Kansas City won two of its last three games to conclude the [[1987 NFL strike|strike-shortened]] 4\u201311 campaign.\n\n====1988====\n{{details|1988 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nThe spring was marked by several notable trades as the club jockeyed to improve on its 4\u201311 finish in 1987. Todd Blackledge was traded to Pittsburgh on March 29 and 12-year veteran quarterback [[Steve DeBerg]] was acquired from Tampa Bay on March 31. The Chiefs moved up one spot in the first round of the draft to select defensive end [[Neil Smith (football player)|Neil Smith]] with the third overall pick. Bill Kenney opened the team's initial two games at quarterback, but was replaced by DeBerg for the second half against Seattle.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> DeBerg guided the team to a 20\u201313 win against [[1988 Denver Broncos season|Denver]] in his initial start as a member of the Chiefs. However, six losses and a tie followed as Kenney and DeBerg jostled for the QB job.\n\nAs the season drew to a close, it became apparent the winds of change were blowing across the organization. President Jack Steadman resigned on December 8, while general manager Jim Schaaf was relieved of his duties the same day.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Steadman was later named chairman of the board. On the field, the Chiefs finished the year at 4\u201311\u20131 as questions swirled regarding Gansz's future and who would fill the club's leadership void. One day after the season's conclusion, former [[Philadelphia Eagles]] and USFL executive [[Carl Peterson]] was named the club's president/general manager and chief operating officer on December 19.\n\n==A change of face==\n\n===\"Martyball\", 1989\u20132000===\n{{Further|1989 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\nAfter compiling an 8\u201322\u20131 record in two seasons, Frank Gansz was relieved of his duties as head coach on January 5, 1989. General manager Carl Peterson's selection as Gansz's successor would be former Cleveland Browns head coach [[Marty Schottenheimer]], who was named the seventh head coach in Chiefs history on January 24. The first draft choice of the Peterson era set the tone for the next decade as the club selected linebacker [[Derrick Thomas]] with the fourth overall selection. Thomas paired with defensive end Neil Smith to form one of the most feared pass-rushing duos in NFL history, compiling a combined 212.5 sacks during their illustrious Chiefs careers. The Peterson-Schottenheimer era got off to an inauspicious start in a 34\u201320 loss at Denver on September 10 as quarterback Steve DeBerg's first pass attempt was intercepted and returned for a TD.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> The club won just four times in its next 10 games as former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback [[Ron Jaworski]] and [[Steve Pelluer]], who was acquired in a trade from Dallas, each opened three games apiece during that span. DeBerg regained the starting job for the final five weeks of the season, generating four wins that put the Chiefs just out of post-season qualification at 8\u20137\u20131. A 34\u20130 shutout win against Houston highlighted the club's stretch run. Running back Christian Okoye became the first Chief to lead the NFL in rushing with 1,480 yards, while Derrick Thomas won consensus NFL Rookie of the Year honors.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\n====1990====\n{{Further|1990 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nThe foundation for the club's formidable offensive line of the 1990s gathered two key ingredients when center [[Tim Grunhard]] and guard [[Dave Szott]] were acquired in the [[1990 NFL Draft]]. Construction began on the club's indoor practice facility at the Truman Sports Complex, giving the Chiefs an 80-yard indoor field and weight room facilities upon its completion. Former defensive tackle Buck Buchanan was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on August 4. In the pre-season, The Chiefs made their initial overseas appearance, losing a 19\u20133 [[American Bowl]] decision against the [[1990 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]] at [[Olympic Stadium (Berlin)|Olympic Stadium]] in Berlin, Germany.

Kansas City led the NFL with a franchise-record 60.0 sacks, including a team-record 20.0 by Derrick Thomas. Thomas established an NFL single-game record with 7.0 sacks in an inspiring [[Veterans Day]] performance against [[1990 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle]], a game the Seahawks miraculously won, 17\u201316, on a last-second, 25-yard TD pass to wide receiver [[Paul Skansi]]. That loss brought on the furious stretch run which saw the club record victories in six of its last seven outings. Behind DeBerg's offensive leadership (23 TD passes with just four interceptions) Kansas City finished the year with a franchise-best +26 turnover differential. The Chiefs clinched their first post-season berth since 1986 with a 24\u201321 win at San Diego and finished the year at 11\u20135, marking the franchise's best finish since 1969. The Chiefs suffered a heart-breaking, 17\u201316 loss at Miami on January 5, 1991, in an AFC Wild Card Game as placekicker Nick Lowery's potential game-winning 52-yard field goal fell short with 0:56 remaining.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\n====1991====\n{{Further|1991 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nOn July 27, former placekicker Jan Stenerud became the first of his position to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

The club finished the regular season at 10\u20136, marking the first time since 1968\u201369 that the franchise had qualified for the playoffs in consecutive seasons. A 27\u201321 victory against the [[1991 Los Angeles Raiders season|Los Angeles Raiders]] in the regular season finale gave the Chiefs the right to host the Raiders just six days later in the inaugural post-season game in Arrowhead's history, and the Chiefs' first home playoff game in 20 years. Thanks to six Los Angeles turnovers, the Chiefs registered their first post-season victory since Super Bowl IV with a 10\u20136 win in an AFC Wild Card Game on December 28.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/> The following week, the Chiefs lost a 37\u201314 decision at Buffalo on January 5, 1992, in an AFC Divisional Playoff match-up as the Buffalo Bills' dynamic offense proved to be too much for the Chiefs.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\n====1992====\n{{Further|1992 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nA longtime nemesis with Seattle, \"Plan B\" free agent quarterback [[Dave Krieg]] was signed as the club's starter on March 19. A melancholy off-season awaited the Chiefs, who mourned the passing of Player Personnel Director Whitey Dovell on May 22 and Hall of Fame defensive tackle Buck Buchanan on July 16. Both Dovell and Buchanan lost courageous battles with cancer. Six-time Pro Bowl safety Deron Cherry announced his retirement in July after registering 50 interceptions in 11 seasons with the franchise. The Chiefs retired the jerseys of former players Buck Buchanan (#86), Willie Lanier (#63) and Jan Stenerud (#3) in a ceremony prior to a pre-season contest against Buffalo.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\nFirst-round draft pick, cornerback [[Dale Carter]] won the Bert Bell Trophy as the NFL's Rookie of the Year. The very first time Carter touched the ball in an NFL contest, he registered a 46-yard punt return touchdown in a 24\u201310 win at [[1992 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego]] on September 6. Running back Christian Okoye surpassed Ed Podolak as the all-time leading rusher in team history against [[1992 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle]] on September 13. Injuries eventually made the 1992 campaign Okoye's last with the Chiefs after he compiled 4,897 rushing yards with the franchise. The club got off to a 3\u20131 start, but was faced with a 4\u20134 record at the season's midpoint. Despite four consecutive victories, the club's post-season hopes still came down to the season's final contest. Owning a 9\u20136 record and needing one more victory to secure a playoff berth, the Chiefs defense tallied three touchdowns, while Dave Krieg tossed a pair of scoring passes as Kansas City claimed a 42\u201320 win against Denver to finish the season at 10\u20136. Despite the big win against [[1992 Denver Broncos season|Denver]], the Chiefs made a quick exit from the playoffs as Krieg was sacked 7 times in a 17\u20130 AFC Wild Card loss at [[1992 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego]] on January 2, 1993.\n\n====1993====\n{{Further|1993 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nThe Chiefs spent the off-season installing the \"[[West Coast offense]]\" under the direction of new offensive coordinator [[Paul Hackett (American football)|Paul Hackett]], who at one time served as quarterbacks coach to [[Joe Montana]] in San Francisco. On April 20, the Chiefs traded for Joe Montana, who directed the 49ers to four Super Bowl victories in the previous decade. Guard [[Will Shields]] was selected with the club's third-round draft choice, rounding out the \"law firm\" of Grunhard, Szott and Shields which anchored the interior of Chiefs offensive line for most of the decade.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\nOn June 9, the club signed unrestricted free agent running back [[Marcus Allen]], who had spent 11 seasons tormenting the Chiefs as a member of the rival Los Angeles Raiders. Montana and Allen made their debuts in a 27\u20133 win at [[1993 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay]] on September 5, marking Montana's first Opening Day appearance since 1990. Shields initiated a franchise-record streak of 175 consecutive starts the following week at [[1993 Houston Oilers season|Houston]]. Thanks to a pair of ''Monday Night Football'' wins at Arrowhead, the club owned a 6\u20132 mid-season record. Before taking the field in a Sunday night contest at [[1993 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]] on December 26, the team learned it had clinched its first AFC West title since 1971 thanks to a [[1993 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] loss earlier in the day. The team finished the season with an 11\u20135 regular season record, marking the club's fourth consecutive year with a double-digit victory tally. Linebacker Derrick Thomas was named the NFL's Man of the Year following the season. Thomas, who founded \"The Third and Long Foundation\", received the honor in large part due to his efforts in promoting children's literacy.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\nKansas City got its first true taste of \"Montana Magic\" as the Hall of Fame passer engineered a brilliant comeback in a 27\u201324 OT win in an AFC Wild Card thriller against [[1993 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh]] on January 8, 1994. Next, the Chiefs traveled to the [[Astrodome]] to face the red-hot Oilers, who had won 11 straight games to conclude the regular season. The heavily favored Oilers opened up a 13\u20137 lead in the fourth quarter, but once again, Montana conjured a comeback, guiding the club to a 28\u201320 victory. The Chiefs playoff journey ended as the club made its initial [[AFC Championship Game]] appearance at Buffalo on January 23. Montana was knocked out of the contest early in the second half as Buffalo claimed its record fourth straight AFC title by a score of 30\u201313.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\n====1994====\n{{Further|1994 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nWhile the previous off-season saw the Chiefs stockpile several key free agents, a number of familiar faces departed following the 1993 season, most notably cornerbacks Albert Lewis and Kevin Ross, as well as placekicker Nick Lowery. Quarterback [[Steve Bono]] was acquired in a trade with San Francisco on May 2 to serve as Joe Montana's backup, a job he previously held when both were with the 49ers. A grass playing field was installed at Arrowhead Stadium, replacing the previous [[AstroTurf]] surface. The club made its second American Bowl appearance in the pre-season, meeting [[1994 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]] in [[Tokyo, Japan]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\nOn September 11, [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]] and the [[1994 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] came to Arrowhead to play against Joe Montana and the Chiefs in a highly anticipated matchup. The Chiefs prevailed over the 49ers and Montana's successor by a 24\u201317 count before a crowd of 79,907, the second-largest \"in-house\" attendance in Arrowhead history.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/> After starting the season 3\u20130, the Chiefs dropped back-to-back games before snapping an 11-game losing streak against [[1994 Denver Broncos season|Denver]] at Mile High Stadium on October 17 in a memorable Monday night contest. Montana orchestrated a masterful comeback, connecting with WR Willie Davis for a five-yard TD with 0:08 remaining to give the Chiefs a 31\u201328 triumph. A late-season, three-game losing skid put the club's playoff hopes in jeopardy. The Chiefs found themselves at 8\u20137 faced with a do-or-die regular season finale against the [[1994 Los Angeles Raiders season|Raiders]] in the final NFL contest (to date) played at the [[Los Angeles Coliseum]] and in Los Angeles until 2016.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/> Marcus Allen had his finest game as a Chief, ironically against his former team, rushing 33 times for 132 yards en route to a 19\u20139 win. At 9\u20137, Kansas City qualified for the playoffs for a fifth straight season. However, the Chiefs made a rapid departure from the playoffs in Montana's final professional contest at Miami on [[New Year's Eve]]. Montana and Dolphins' quarterback Dan Marino conducted a masterful first-half duel that ended deadlocked at 17\u201317, but [[1994 Miami Dolphins season|Miami]] eventually prevailed by a 27\u201317 count.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\n====1995====\n{{Further|1995 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nJoe Montana announced his retirement from football after 16 years in the NFL on April 18 and Steve Bono was promoted to the starting job. Immediately, so-called media experts predicted much gloom and doom for the 1995 Chiefs under Bono, leading Schottenheimer to quip during training camp that his club had been picked \"sixth in a five-team division.\"<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/> Led by Bono, who merited a Pro Bowl berth, Kansas City posted an NFL-best 13\u20133 record with unblemished 8\u20130 marks in the AFC West and at Arrowhead. The Chiefs led the NFL in rushing offense (138.9 ypg), scoring defense (15.1 ppg) and turnover ratio (+12). A 24\u20133 win at Arizona on October 1 featured a surreal, 76-yard TD run on a bootleg by Bono as the Chiefs initiated a seven-game winning streak, the franchise's longest since 1969. In a ''Monday Night Football'' classic against [[1995 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego]] on October 9, wide receiver [[Tamarick Vanover]] returned a punt for an 86-yard TD to provide the winning points in a 29\u201323 victory, the team's third straight home win in overtime.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\nThe club's defense began to flex its muscle, beginning with a 21\u20137 win at Denver on October 22. The contest, played in a Rocky Mountain snowstorm, featured the 100th rushing TD of Marcus Allen's career. The Chiefs won a home game for the third time on a last-second return score that concluded in Arrowhead's west end zone when cornerback [[Mark Collins (American football)|Mark Collins]] scooped up a fumble for a 20\u201313 win against [[1995 Houston Oilers season|Houston]]. Kansas City clinched a division title with a 29\u201323 victory at [[1995 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland]] on December 3 en route to a franchise-best 13\u20133 regular season record and a team-record sixth consecutive postseason berth. The Chiefs were represented by seven players in the Pro Bowl, more than any other AFC team.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/> In the playoffs, the Chiefs dropped an AFC Divisional Playoff Game against the underdog [[1995 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] on January 7\u2014a blustery afternoon with the temperature at 11 degrees and a wind chill of \u22129. Three interceptions and three missed field goals from placekicker [[Lin Elliot]] contributed to the 10\u20137 loss at Arrowhead.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\n====1996====\n{{Further|1996 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nKansas City entered the 1996 campaign with essentially the same lineup as the club boasted in 1995 and were featured on the cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' along with Green Bay as pre-season Super Bowl favorites. Kansas City made its third American Bowl appearance, this time against [[1996 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas]] in [[Monterrey, Mexico]]. The club started the season with a 4\u20130 record for the first time in team history, but the season's lofty expectations came crashing down as the squad lost three of its next four games. A three-game winning streak, including a victory over the eventual [[Super Bowl XXXI|Super Bowl champion]] [[1996 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]], put the club back in post-season contention at 8\u20133.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\nThat rosy picture quickly crumbled in a 28\u201314 loss against San Diego on November 24 as Steve Bono was relieved in the second half by back-up quarterback [[Rich Gannon]]. Gannon assumed the starting reins for a 28\u201324 win in a Thanksgiving Day game at [[1996 Detroit Lions season|Detroit]] as Marcus Allen registered his 111th career rushing TD to surpass [[Walter Payton]] as the NFL's all-time leader in that department, a mark that was later broken by [[Emmitt Smith]]. Needing just one more win to qualify for the playoffs, the Chiefs dropped their next two games as an injury-hampered Gannon was sidelined for good in the second quarter of a 24\u201319 loss against [[1996 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis]]. Faced with a must-win situation in a frigid regular season finale at Buffalo, the club's post-season hopes hinged on Bono. Despite a 20\u20139 loss to the [[1996 Buffalo Bills season|Bills]], the Chiefs still had a shot to slip into the playoffs if Atlanta could secure a win at Jacksonville. However, Atlanta placekicker [[Morten Andersen]]'s 30-yard field goal attempt went wide left with 0:04 remaining, preserving a 19\u201317 win and the AFC's final Wild Card spot for the [[1996 Jacksonville Jaguars season|Jaguars]], who won a tiebreaker with Kansas City. The Chiefs finished with a 9\u20137 record, missing the postseason for the first time since 1989.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\n====1997====\n{{Further|1997 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nKansas City dramatically retooled its roster in 1997, beginning with the signing of free agent quarterback Elvis Grbac on March 17. In addition to Grbac, the Chiefs lineup featured 11 new starters, including wide receiver [[Andre Rison]], who won team MVP honors after becoming the club's first Pro Bowl receiver in a decade. On defense, the club's top four picks from the 1996 Draft, safeties [[Jerome Woods]] and [[Reggie Tongue]], defensive end [[John Browning (American football)|John Browning]] and linebacker [[Donnie Edwards]], all emerged as starters.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\nTackle [[John Alt]] announced his retirement at training camp in River Falls, Wisconsin on July 21. All the new faces quickly formed a cohesive unit as the Chiefs posted a 13\u20133 record, an 8\u20130 Arrowhead record and their second AFC West title in three years. The club engineered several dramatic finishes, the first of which came in a ''Monday Night Football'' thriller at Oakland on September 8 when Elvis Grbac connected with Andre Rison on an improbable 32-yard TD pass with just 0:03 remaining to cap a 28\u201327 win. Six days later, Kansas City's defense produced a remarkable goal-line stand to preserve a 22\u201316 victory at Arrowhead vs. [[1997 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/> After posting a 6\u20132 record during the season's first half, Kansas City's good fortune appeared to run out against Pittsburgh when Grbac suffered a broken clavicle. However, Rich Gannon led the team to a 5\u20131 mark in their next six outings.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\nPlacekicker [[Pete Stoyanovich]] provided one of the year's most memorable moments, connecting on a line-drive 54-yard field as time expired to give Kansas City a 24\u201322 win against Denver on November 16. [[1997 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco]] entered Arrowhead boasting an 11-game winning streak, the team departed after suffering a 44\u20139 defeat. The Chiefs' vaunted defensive unit pitched a 30\u20130 shutout vs. Oakland on December 7. The Chiefs led the NFL in scoring defense, allowing a mere 14.5 points per game. The 232 total points permitted by the Chiefs in 1997 were the lowest tally ever allowed in a 16-game season in team history. Kansas City also broke a 63-year-old mark owned by the [[1934 NFL season|1934]] [[1934 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]] by not permitting a second-half TD in 10 consecutive games. Grbac returned for the regular season finale against [[1997 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans]] on December 21 as the squad finished the year with six consecutive victories, a first in team history.\n\nThe Chiefs' 13\u20133 record gave them home field advantage throughout the AFC Playoffs. However, their playoff run was short-lived, as Kansas City lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos 14\u201310 in the Divisional round.\n\n====1998====\n{{details|1998 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nThe following year, with Elvis Grbac back at the helm, the Chiefs fell to 7\u20139 in [[1998 NFL season|1998]]. Marty Schottenheimer took much of the blame for his failed attempts in the playoffs and conservative style of coaching (\"[[Martyball]]\"), and resigned following the 1998 season.\n\n====1999====\n{{details|topic=1999 Kansas City Chiefs season|1999 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\nSchottenheimer left as head coach, replaced by his defensive coach [[Gunther Cunningham]]. In two years, Cunningham showed little improvement, going 9\u20137 and 7\u20139. After the loss of [[Derrick Thomas]], the collapse of the defense was unmistakable. The Chiefs' wins were mostly made by a high scoring offense rather than a powerful defense.\n\n==The Chiefs in the 21st century==\n\n===An explosive offense, 2001\u20132005===\n\n====2001====\n{{details|topic=2001 Kansas City Chiefs season|2001 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nAfter coaching the [[1999 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Rams]] to the [[Super Bowl]] and retiring, [[Dick Vermeil]] was lured out of retirement and took over as head coach in [[2001 NFL season|2001]]. It was noted that Vermeil would have the team ready for the Super Bowl \"within three years\", while in fact Vermeil would stay in Kansas City for the next five.\n\nThe first move the team made was forced after quarterback Elvis Grbac voided his contract, forgoing an $11 million bonus, leaving to lead the [[Super Bowl XXXV|Super Bowl champion]] [[2000 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]]. Vermeil replaced him with his primary pick for the Rams' quarterback, [[Trent Green]].\n\nAnother notable replacement was [[Priest Holmes]] at running back, who had served as back-up to Baltimore's [[Jamal Lewis]] in their Super Bowl season. Additions to the offensive line, including left tackle [[Willie Roaf]] from New Orleans, [[Casey Wiegmann]] at center, Brian Waters at guard, and [[John Welbourn]] from Philadelphia helped create the Chiefs' high powered offense. Holmes would go on to break [[Marshall Faulk]]'s record of 26 touchdowns in a season on December 27, 2003.\n\nVermeil brought many elements of \"[[The Greatest Show on Turf]]\" from St. Louis to Kansas City's own offense, but much like the Schottenheimer era in the 1990s, the offense didn't win any playoff games.\n\n====2003====\n{{Main|2003 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nThe Chiefs went 13\u20133 in [[2003 NFL season|2003]] and their offense, considered by many as one of the most powerful of all time, helped make Kansas City again a favorite to win [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]]. After starting 9\u20130, the Chiefs lost to the [[2003 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]] in their tenth game following a \"guarantee\" by Bengals wide receiver [[Chad Ochocinco|Chad Johnson]]. The Chiefs' dream season of 2003 began to lose momentum by November, but they still managed to gain the number two seed in the [[2003\u201304 NFL playoffs|2004 playoffs]]. The mighty homefield advantage of Arrowhead Stadium and their high-powered offense wouldn't lead the Chiefs to glory and the Chiefs lost to the [[2003 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] in the AFC Divisional playoffs in an offensive shootout in which neither team punted, an NFL playoffs first. The Chiefs' defense came under fire immediately after the loss, and [[Greg Robinson (American football coach)|Greg Robinson]], the team's defensive coordinator, resigned after the season.\n\n====2004====\n{{Main|2004 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nAs with the loss to the Broncos in 1997, this loss led to a poor following season. The Chiefs managed to finish the [[2004 NFL season|2004 season]] with a 7\u20139 record. In 2004, Gunther Cunningham was brought back as the defensive coordinator. However, the defense showed little improvement. The offense, unable to record the same high scores as the previous year, was unable to bring in the wins as they had the previous year.\n\n[[File:Larry_Johnson_Chiefs.jpg|thumb|left|Running back [[Larry Johnson (running back)|Larry Johnson]]]]\n====2005====\n{{Main|2005 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nFor their 2005 campaign, the Chiefs brought in several new players to boost a defense that had finished among the worst units the past three years. The year also saw [[Larry Johnson (running back)|Larry Johnson]] start at running back in place of an injured [[Priest Holmes]]. But despite winning ten games, the Chiefs became just the fourth team in NFL history to go 10\u20136 and not reach the playoffs.\n\n===Rebuilding a contender, 2006\u20132012===\n\n====2006====\n{{Main|2006 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nA tearful head coach [[Dick Vermeil]] announced his retirement before the final game of the [[2005 Kansas City Chiefs season|2005 season]]. Within two weeks, then-[[New York Jets]] head coach [[Herman Edwards]] had signed a new 4-year contract to coach the Chiefs. The 2006 Chiefs returned to the playoffs for the first time in three seasons, only to lose 23\u20138 in the Wild Card round against their playoff nemesis, the [[2006 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]].\n\nMeanwhile, Chiefs owner and founder [[Lamar Hunt]] died on December 13, 2006, due to complications brought on by a ten-year battle with [[prostate cancer]]. Hunt was remembered throughout the remainder of the [[2006 NFL season|2006 season]] all throughout the NFL with moments of silence and ceremonies in Kansas City. Hunt's four children inherited ownership of the Chiefs. His oldest son, [[Clark Hunt|Clark]], became chairman and CEO of the Chiefs, and the public face of the ownership group. He represents the Chiefs at owner meetings, and has the final say in team operations.\n[[File:Tony_Gonzalez_at_2005_Pro_Bowl_050213-N-3019M-002.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Tight end [[Tony Gonzalez]] in 2005]]\n====2007====\n{{Main|2007 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nThe Chiefs' 2007 off-season began with turmoil over the contract of [[Tony Gonzalez]], and the long-term career of [[Trent Green]] in Kansas City. Backup quarterback [[Damon Huard]] was signed to a three-year contract in February and Green was not only asked to restructure his contract but offered in trades to other teams.\n\nOn June 5, the Chiefs agreed to trade Green to the [[Miami Dolphins]] for a conditional fifth round pick in the [[2008 NFL Draft]], pending a physical from Green.<ref name=\"Green goes to Dolphins\">Pasquarelli, Len.

Five different running backs were used after [[Larry Johnson (running back)|Larry Johnson]] was injured in week 9 against [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay]]. The team also had no stability at quarterback with Huard and [[Brodie Croyle]], while their offensive line depleted in the absence of their former Pro Bowl guard [[Will Shields]].\n\nThe season ended with a nine-game losing streak, the team's first since [[1987 Kansas City Chiefs season|1987]], and a 4\u201312 record. It was the Chiefs' first season with 12 losses since [[1978 Kansas City Chiefs season|1978]].\n\nHead coach Herman Edwards continued to build upon the Chiefs' roster with young players, mostly on defense, and attempted stabilize a once record-setting offensive line.<ref name=\"Transition\"/> The Chiefs continue to rebuild a defense that may quietly creep its way back to respectability.<ref name=\"Transition\">Teicher, Adam.

Other than that, there was little else of note about the season, which saw Kansas City fall to a franchise-worst 2\u201314 record.\n\nDuring the next offseason, the team made news by acquiring quarterback [[Matt Cassel]] (who had filled in for Brady during the previous year) and veteran linebacker [[Mike Vrabel]] from New England for a second-round draft pick, which was used to obtain LSU defensive end [[Tyson Jackson]]. The Chiefs were also awarded the 256th and last player in the draft for the first time since 1970, South Carolina kicker [[Ryan Succop]]. Also, [[Scott Pioli]] was hired as general manager, yet another acquisition from New England.\n\nThere was little apparent sign of improvement as the Chiefs began 2009 by losing five games in a row before a victory over the Washington Redskins in Week 6. However, the team did manage to inflict an overtime defeat on the defending Super Bowl Champion Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 11, and closed out the year with a 4\u201312 record by overpowering Denver and preventing the Broncos from going to the playoffs. In that game, second-year running back [[Jamaal Charles]] set a franchise record by rushing for 259 yards.\n\nThe Chiefs got off to a 3\u20130 start in 2010, first by beating San Diego 21\u201314 on ''Monday Night Football''. This was their first MNF win in a decade, in addition to their first home win over the Chargers since 2006. They followed up the next week with a 16\u201314 win in Cleveland, followed by a 31\u201310 thrashing of the San Francisco 49ers at home. The Chiefs entered their bye week as the only remaining undefeated team, but as most experts predicted, fell to Indianapolis 19\u20139 in Week 5. They lost a close game with the Houston Texans (35\u201331) in Week 6, beat Jacksonville in Week 7, and then won a razor-thin game against the winless Buffalo Bills. After going into overtime with a 10\u201310 score, neither team was able to score anything until Ryan Succop kicked a 35-yard field goal just as the clock reached 0:00 and avoiding a tie. Then came losses to Oakland and Denver, three straight wins over Seattle, Arizona, and Denver, a loss in San Diego, and wins over St. Louis and Tennessee. Losing the final game at home versus Oakland, the Chiefs finished 10\u20136 and won their first division title since 2003. However, the team's lack of postseason experience showed up as they were buried 30\u20137 by the Baltimore Ravens in the wild card round of the playoffs.\n\nKansas City began 2011 by losing its first three games, including blowout losses at home against Buffalo and at Detroit, where the Chiefs lost Jamaal Charles for the remainder of the season due to a torn ACL. However, the Chiefs were able to rebound from the slow start, winning their next four contests, including a thrilling overtime victory over San Diego on ''Monday Night Football''. Unfortunately, the Chiefs would lose all momentum the following week when they were stunned at Arrowhead by the winless Miami Dolphins, losing quarterback Matt Cassel for the season with a hand injury. After losing four of the next five, the Chiefs fired head coach Todd Haley less than one year removed from a division title. With interim head coach [[Romeo Crennel]] and recently acquired quarterback [[Kyle Orton]] at the helm, the Chiefs were able to knock off then-undefeated Green Bay, and at 6\u20138, still had a shot at the division crown. The Chiefs would fall just short, however, losing 16\u201313 in overtime to arch-rival Oakland. The Chiefs would finish the 2011 season with a road win versus eventual AFC West champion Denver, finishing the season at 7\u20139.\n\nThe Chiefs hit rock bottom in 2012, with a passing game that was one of the worst of all time. Cassel was benched twice in favor of [[Brady Quinn]], but neither quarterback could perform well enough to win more than one game each. Despite having a roster that produced five Pro Bowlers and a 1,500-yard rushing season from Charles, the Chiefs stumbled to a 1\u20139 record.\n\nKansas City's 2012 season took a tragic and bizarre turn on December 1 when linebacker [[Jovan Belcher]] murdered his girlfriend in an argument. He then drove to Arrowhead Stadium, where he got into a confrontation with Crennel and several other Chiefs employees in the parking lot. They attempted to calm him down, after which Belcher thanked them and immediately shot himself dead.\n\nWith the team scheduled to play against Carolina the next day, there was considerable controversy as to whether the game should go on, but in the end it was decided not to move or cancel it. In a half-empty stadium, the Chiefs won the emotional match 27\u201321.\n\nAfter the Chiefs' victory over Carolina, the team did not win again in the 2012 season, only averaging 5.75 points per game in their final four games,<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/kan/2012.htm</ref> and finished the season on a four-game losing streak and with a 2\u201314 record on the season.\n\nFollowing the 2012 season, both head coach Romeo Crennel and general manager [[Scott Pioli]] were fired from their positions. On January 4, the Chiefs signed former [[Philadelphia Eagles]] head coach [[Andy Reid]], who had been fired after coaching the Eagles for the past fourteen years, and on January 13 of the same year the Chiefs hired [[John Dorsey (American football)|John Dorsey]] to be their general manager.\n\n===The Andy Reid era, 2013\u2013present===\n\n====2013====\n\n{{details|2013 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs, due to their 2\u201314 record in the season prior, received the #1 pick in the [[2013 NFL Draft]], which was the first time in franchise history that team had the #1 pick in the NFL Draft that was not acquired in a transaction. However, about eight weeks prior to their first selection in the 2013 NFL Draft, the Chiefs traded for quarterback [[Alex Smith]], who the year prior had been benched in favor of [[Colin Kaepernick]] on the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. The Chiefs were able to acquire Smith by trading their second round picks in 2013 and 2014. While this move did end up bringing the quarterback for the Chiefs for the next five years to Kansas City, the selection was only supported by a plurality of Chiefs fans<ref>http://www.arrowheadpride.com/2013/2/27/4036414/alex-smith-trade-approval-poll-chiefs-trade-49ers</ref> at the time of the trade. After an offseason that brought players such as [[Sean Smith (cornerback)|Sean Smith]] and [[Geoff Schwartz]], the Chiefs selected [[Eric Fisher (American football)|Eric Fisher]] with the first pick in the 2013 NFL Draft, as well as selecting future four time Pro Bowler [[Travis Kelce]] in the third round of the same draft. In the 2013 season, the Chiefs started the season with an incredible start, tying the 2003 team as the best start in franchise history and being the last team undefeated in the 2013 season, starting out with a 9\u20130 record. However, due a more difficult second half of the Chiefs schedule and somewhat of a regression by the Chiefs defense, the team faltered down the stretch, going 2\u20135 in their final seven games.\n\nEven though the team struggled near the end of the season, the Chiefs still clinched a playoff berth as a wildcard and played the [[Indianapolis Colts]] in the first round of the [[2013\u201314 NFL playoffs]]. It seemed that the Chiefs would be able to win their first playoff game in twenty years and go on to the Divisional Round, but even though the Chiefs took a 38\u201310 lead in the early portion of the third quarter, the Chiefs were unable to contain the Colts offense and lost the game by only one point, 45\u201344.<ref>https://www.arrowheadpride.com/2014/1/4/5274372/chiefs-colts-final-score-kc-blows-28-point-lead-lose-in-wild-card</ref>\n\n[[File:Eric_Berry.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Safety [[Eric Berry]] was an integral part of the Chiefs defense in the 2010s]]\n====2014====\n\n{{details|2014 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nEntering the 2014 season, the Chiefs had the twenty-second pick in the [[2014 NFL Draft]], and selected linebacker [[Dee Ford]] out of Alabama, as well as future starting right guard [[Laurent Duvernay-Tardif]] with the 200th pick of the same draft.\n\nUnlike the 2013 season, the Chiefs were unable to get out to a good start on the year, as the Chiefs lost their first two and three out of their first five games. However, after a bye week in week 6, the Chiefs went on a tear, as they won their next five games, dominating the St. Louis Rams and the New York Jets, as well as beating the eventual Super Bowl participant Seattle Seahawks to put the team at a 7\u20133 record after ten games.\n\nHowever, disaster struck as the team suffered a devastating loss to the winless 0\u201310 [[Oakland Raiders]], who were able to upset the Chiefs on [[Thursday Night Football]]. This led to a three-game losing streak, which put the Chiefs at 7\u20136 on the season and desperately needing to win out for a chance to play in the [[2014\u201315 NFL playoffs|NFL playoffs]]. This did not occur, as the Chiefs lost to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in Week 16 and eventually missed the playoffs with a 9\u20137 record.\n\nOne bright spot was LB [[Justin Houston]], who set a franchise record with 22.0 sacks, only 0.5 sacks short of the NFL record set by [[Michael Strahan]].\n\n====2015====\n\n{{details|2015 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nEntering the 2015 season, the Chiefs had the eighteenth pick in the [[2015 NFL Draft]], and selected cornerback [[Marcus Peters]] out of Washington, who would become the eventual Defensive Rookie of the Year and a two time Pro Bowler for the Kansas City Chiefs. In the same draft, the Chiefs also selected future starters such as [[Mitch Morse]], [[Chris Conley (American football)|Chris Conley]], and [[Steven Nelson]].\n\nWhile the Chiefs were able to win their first game against the [[Houston Texans]] and in their second game of the season, they held a 24\u201317 lead with only two minutes to play against the [[Denver Broncos]], who had won the past four [[AFC West]] championships, the Chiefs allowed a touchdown and then fumbled with less than thirty seconds remaining, sealing a victory for the Broncos. This loss was the first of five consecutive losses, and the team seemed to be spiraling out of control with a record of 1\u20135.\n\nThankfully for the Chiefs, the team overall began to play better and began an extremely improbable eleven game winning streak, beating the eventual Super Bowl Champion Denver Broncos in their third game of the streak, and this streak was able to give the Chiefs the push they needed to make the [[2015\u201316 NFL playoffs]], as they clinched in Week 16, and even had a chance to win the AFC West in Week 17 if the Broncos lost and the Chiefs won. While the Chiefs were able to beat the [[Oakland Raiders]] and uphold their end of the scenario, the [[San Diego Chargers]] fell short and were unable to beat the Denver Broncos, and the Broncos clinched the division and home-field throughout the AFC Playoffs.\n\nIn the Chiefs first game of the postseason, they matched up against the 9\u20137 Houston Texans, and after a 22-year drought, the Chiefs were finally able to win a playoff game as the Chiefs walloped the Texans 30\u20130. This victory was the first time the Chiefs had won a playoff game since 1993, and gave the Chiefs the chance to make the AFC Championship Game for only the second time in team history, if they could beat the [[New England Patriots]] on the road. The Chiefs were unable to beat the Patriots, as injuries and losing the turnover battle sealed the loss for the Chiefs, and they were unable to beat the Patriots and lost 27\u201320 in the divisional round.\n \nOne notable achievement during this season was the first award given to the Chiefs in the Andy Reid era, as Marcus Peters won the Defensive Rookie of the Year award, and Eric Berry also won the Comeback Player of the Year award after beating his battle with cancer and playing well with the Chiefs in his first year after his treatment.\n\n====2016====\n\n{{details|2016 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nIn the [[2016 NFL Draft]], the Chiefs traded back out of the first round and instead drafted with the 37th pick in the draft, and used this selection to draft [[Chris Jones (defensive tackle, born 1994)|Chris Jones]]. As well as drafting Chris Jones, the Chiefs selected eventual three-time Pro Bowler [[Tyreek Hill]] in the fifth round of the same draft.\n\nThe Chiefs start to the season was no more than mediocre, and the before their bye week the Chiefs were destroyed by the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] 43\u201314, which put the Chiefs on 2\u20132 for the year. After the bye week, however, the Chiefs won their next five games and were sitting at 7\u20132 on the season until an upset occurred as the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] were able to eek out a two-point victory against the Chiefs at [[Arrowhead Stadium]], as the Bucs won 19\u201317. The Chiefs experienced an almost identical game against another team that missed the postseason, losing 19\u201317 to the [[Tennessee Titans]] at home. This loss put the Chiefs at 10\u20134 and the dream of a division title was in jeopardy. Heading into Week 17, the Chiefs were 11\u20134 and their rival, the [[Oakland Raiders]], were 12\u20133 but the Raiders did not have the tiebreaker on the Chiefs. In order for the Chiefs to clinch the division, similar to the 2015 season, the Chiefs needed a win and the division leader to lose. Unlike 2015, however, the division leader lost as the Oakland Raiders were unable to start their quarterback, [[Derek Carr]] due to an injury and the Raiders lost to the Broncos. The Chiefs were able to pick up a crucial victory over the [[San Diego Chargers]] (which would also be their final game in San Diego) and clinch the division and a first-round bye.\n\nHeading into the [[2016-17 NFL playoffs]], the Chiefs were 12\u20134 and claimed the second seed in the AFC. After the Pittsburgh Steelers were able to defeat the [[Miami Dolphins]] in the Wildcard Round, it was confirmed that the Chiefs would have to play the same team that beat them by 29 points fifteen weeks prior. While the Chiefs were able to hold Pittsburgh from scoring any touchdowns in their divisional round game, the Chiefs were only able to put up sixteen points of offense and the Steelers' six field goals were enough to put the Steelers into the AFC Championship Game and once again give a devastating playoff loss to the franchise.\n\n====2017====\n\n{{details|2017 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nIn the [[2017 NFL Draft]], the Chiefs decided to trade up into the draft, giving up their first round selections in 2017 and 2018 as well as their third round pick in 2017 in order to move up to #10 in the draft. With this selection, the Chiefs selected [[Patrick Mahomes]], their first quarterback drafted in the first round since 1983. While Mahomes would only start one game in the 2017 season, he was pegged to become the future of the franchise as the Chiefs had to trade a significant amount of draft capital in order to secure the quarterback. As well, during the offseason [[John Dorsey (American football)|John Dorsey]] was fired and [[Brett Veach]] was promoted to become the Chiefs next general manager.\n\nThe Chiefs were able to start the season strong, and after five games the Chiefs were 5\u20130 on the season. However, the Chiefs were unable to keep the winning streak alive and instead started a streak in the other direction, losing six of seven and four in a row. This put the Chiefs at 6\u20136 on the season and they desperately needed a win against the [[Los Angeles Chargers]] to put themselves in a good position to win back to back AFC West titles. The Chiefs were able to beat the Chargers and move to 7\u20136. The Chiefs were able to win their next two games and clinch the [[AFC West]] in Week 16, which was the first time in team history that they had won consecutive division titles. With the Chiefs being locked into the #4 seed in the AFC, the Chiefs rested most of their starters and Patrick Mahomes started his first game of his career. While his numbers were not incredibly impressive, he showed raw talent with several impressive throws. He was also able to win this game, and the Chiefs finished the year at 10\u20136 and with the #4 seed in the AFC.\n\nIn the [[2017\u201318 NFL playoffs]], the Chiefs were matched up with the 9\u20137 [[Tennessee Titans]], led by [[Marcus Mariota]]. The Chiefs were able to get out to an early 21\u20133 lead, but the offense and defense faltered down the stretch and the Chiefs lost another close playoff game as the final score was 22\u201321 Titans. One bright spot for the team was rookie sensation [[Kareem Hunt]], who led the NFL in rushing yards and was selected to the Pro Bowl as well as being named Co-Offensive Rookie of the Year, along with [[Alvin Kamara]].\n\n[[File:Patrick Mahomes II.JPG|right|thumb|Patrick Mahomes, the Chiefs starting quarterback since 2018, has broken numerous passing records and garnered an MVP award]]\n====2018====\n\n{{details|2018 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nIn the same month as the playoff loss to the Tennessee Titans, a trade was announced between the Chiefs and the [[Washington Redskins]], and after five years of starting at least fifteen games in each year, [[Alex Smith]] was traded to the Redskins. In return, the Chiefs received [[Kendall Fuller]] and a third-round pick.\n\nIn the [[2018 NFL Draft]], the Chiefs did not have a first-round selection due to their trade to acquire the selection to draft [[Patrick Mahomes]], but they traded up to select [[Breeland Speaks]] in the second round of the NFL Draft. This draft also demonstrated the emphasis on improving the defense as the Chiefs only selected defensive players in the draft.\n\nIdentically to 2017, the Chiefs started out the season 5\u20130 and then lost their following game to an AFC juggernaut, this time to the [[New England Patriots]] in primetime. During this stretch, Patrick Mahomes threw ten touchdown passes in his first two games and four more over the next three. This was the start of an incredible campaign for the 23-year-old, as he finished the season with over 5,000 yards and 50 touchdowns, being the second quarterback in NFL history to accomplish that feat, only behind [[Peyton Manning]]. After the Chiefs fell to the Patriots, they then won their next four to sit at 9\u20131 heading into their game against the also 9\u20131 [[Los Angeles Rams]]. While Patrick Mahomes threw six touchdown passes and led his team to over 50 points, he also had five turnovers and the Chiefs became the first team in NFL history to lose a game while also scoring 50 points or more, as the Chiefs lost 54\u201351. The Chiefs then won their next two games to clinch a playoff berth in Week 14 as they were able to beat the [[Baltimore Ravens]] in overtime and sit at 11\u20132 on the season. Only needing a victory to secure a first-round bye and a third consecutive [[AFC West]] title, the Chiefs fell short against the [[Los Angeles Chargers]] and fell to 11\u20133 on the season as they lost 29\u201328. After the Chargers lost the following Saturday to the Baltimore Ravens and the [[Houston Texans]] lost to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], the Chiefs only needed to beat the [[Seattle Seahawks]] to clinch the #1 seed in the AFC and an AFC West title. The Chiefs, however, fell short and lost 38\u201331. Now sitting at 11\u20134 and only needing to beat the Oakland Raiders to clinch the #1 seed in the AFC but also having the risk of falling all the way to the #5 seed, the Chiefs walloped the 4\u201311 [[Oakland Raiders]] 35\u20133, and clinched their third consecutive AFC West title and the #1 seed in the AFC for the first time since 1997.\n\nHeading into the [[2018\u201319 NFL playoffs]], the Chiefs were sitting at 12\u20134 and were the #1 seed in the AFC. After the Indianapolis Colts were able to beat the Houston Texans on the road, the Colts came to Kansas City to play the Chiefs in a divisional round matchup. The Colts to this point were 4\u20130 against the Chiefs in the playoffs and had given them plenty of trouble in the past. However, the Chiefs continued their stellar season with an impressive victory over the Colts, as the Chiefs won 31\u201313 and did not falter down the stretch like some of their previous postseason games in the Andy Reid era. This win came on a combination of four rushing touchdowns and a defense that only allowed six points, as the other seven came on a blocked punt that was recovered for a touchdown. With this victory, the Chiefs were able to host the [[AFC Championship Game]] for the first time in team history, and this was the first time ever that Kansas City had hosted a conference championship or a championship game in the AFL or NFL. After the New England Patriots beat the Los Angeles Chargers, the matchup was set: Patriots at Chiefs for the AFC Championship.\n\nIn the AFC Championship Game, the Chiefs started out slow and were shut out in the first half, and the Patriots were leading 14\u20130. By the fourth quarter, however, the Chiefs were winning 21\u201317. The teams traded blows during the fourth quarter, where the two teams combined to score 38 points in the quarter. Down 31\u201328 with one timeout and only thirty-nine seconds to go, the Chiefs were able to drive down the field and kick a field goal to send the game into overtime. However, the Chiefs did not win the coin toss and the Patriots received the ball to begin overtime. The Chiefs were able to get the Patriots into three 3rd down and 10 to go situations, however the Patriots converted on all of them and eventually scored a touchdown to win the game by a score of 37\u201331. It was the third consecutive year where the Chiefs had lost a playoff game by six points or less.\n\nThe 2018 Chiefs also became the first team in NFL history to score at least 26 points in all of their games.\n\n====2019====\n{{details|2019 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\nHeading into the 2019 offseason, the Chiefs had many key players that they cut, traded, or allowed to become free agents. Some of these players included [[Dee Ford]] (traded after being franchise tagged), [[Mitch Morse]], [[Chris Conley (American football)|Chris Conley]], Allen Bailey, Justin Houston, Eric Berry, and more. The Chiefs also had to find a new defensive coordinator after the firing of [[Bob Sutton (American football)|Bob Sutton]] following the collapse against New England in the AFC Championship game. The Chiefs would hire [[Steve Spagnuolo]] as their defensive coordinator on January 24, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bergman|first=Jeremy|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001013167/article/chiefs-hire-steve-spagnuolo-as-defensive-coordinator|title=Chiefs hire Steve Spagnuolo as defensive coordinator|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=January 24, 2019|accessdate=January 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\nKansas City enjoyed a 4\u20130 start before losing to the [[2019 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] and [[2019 Houston Texans season|Houston Texans]].

They once again found themselves behind early as Tennessee took a 10\u20130 lead, but Kansas City took the lead by halftime, thanks to two passing touchdowns from Mahomes to [[Tyreek Hill]] and a Mahomes touchdown run. The Chiefs ultimately won 35\u201324, avenging another regular season loss and clinching their first Super Bowl appearance in 50 years.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/afc-championship-2020-patrick-mahomes-helps-end-50-year-super-bowl-drought-for-chiefs-and-their-fans/ |title=AFC Championship 2020: Patrick Mahomes helps end 50-year Super Bowl drought for Chiefs and their fans |last=Dodd |first=Dennis |date=2020-01-19 |website=CBSSports.com |language=en |access-date=2020-01-20}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Super Bowl LIV]], the Chiefs were down 20-10 in the 4th quarter only to come back and win 31-20 to get their first Super Bowl in 50 years and second Super Bowl overall.

The team was a charter member of the [[American Football League]] (AFL), and now is currently part of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) (they are not associated with an earlier [[Dallas Texans (NFL)|Dallas Texans]] NFL team that only played for one season in 1952).\n\nThe Texans won the AFL Championship in 1962, and the team relocated to [[Kansas City, Missouri]], the following year. In 1966, the Chiefs won their second AFL title and appeared in the [[Super Bowl I|inaugural AFL-NFL World Championship game]]. In 1969, the Chiefs won the final AFL title and went on to defeat the NFL's [[Spread betting|heavily favored]] [[Minnesota Vikings]] in [[Super Bowl IV]]. The Texans/Chiefs were the most victorious franchise in AFL history, compiling an 87\u201348\u20135 record from 1960 to 1969. They won the Super Bowl in January 1970, and February 2, 2020, at 09:12 p.m. Central.\n\n==AFL origins==\n{{details|topic=more information on the AFL's origins|American Football League}}\nIn 1959, [[Lamar Hunt]], son of oil [[tycoon]] [[H. L. Hunt]], began discussions with other businessmen in establishing an American football organization that would rival that of the [[National Football League]]. Since as early as 1958, Hunt had the interest of purchasing an NFL franchise and moving them to [[Dallas, Texas]]. His desire to secure a professional football franchise was further heightened after watching the historic [[1958 NFL Championship Game]] between the [[1958 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]] and the [[1958 New York Giants season|New York Giants]]. The team that Hunt was most interested in buying was the [[Chicago Cardinals (NFL, 1920\u201359)|Chicago Cardinals]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History AFL\">[http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/ Kansas City Chiefs History AFL Origins\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205213037/http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/ |date=2007-02-05 }}</ref>\n\nThe NFL convinced Hunt to contact Cardinals owner [[Violet Bidwill Wolfner]], and her husband Walter Wolfner eventually agreed to sell Hunt 20 percent of the Cardinals franchise. Hunt declined the opportunity. He then conceived the concept of forming a second league. \"Why wouldn't a second league work\", Hunt recalled. \"There was an [[American League|American]] and [[National League]] in baseball, why not football?\" Hunt contacted several other individuals who had expressed interest in the Cardinals franchise\u2014[[Bud Adams]], [[Bob Howsam]], [[Max Winter]] and Bill Boyer\u2014and gauged their interest in forming a second league.<ref name=\"Chiefs History AFL\"/>\n\nOn August 14, the first meeting of the new league was held in [[Chicago]]. Charter memberships were issued to six original cities \u2014 Dallas, [[New York Jets|New York]], [[Houston Oilers|Houston]], [[Denver Broncos|Denver]], [[Los Angeles Chargers|Los Angeles]] and [[Minnesota Vikings|Minneapolis]]. The league was officially christened the American Football League on August 22. [[Ralph Wilson]] was extended the league's [[Buffalo Bills|seventh franchise]] on October 28 and [[Billy Sullivan (American football)|Billy Sullivan]] became the league's [[New England Patriots|eighth team]]'s owner on November 22. Minneapolis withdrew its franchise from the AFL in November after receiving an offer for a team in the NFL,<ref name=\"Chiefs History AFL\"/> and [[Oakland, California]] instead joined the AFL as the [[Oakland Raiders]].\n\n===Early years in Dallas===\n[[File:Swink fleer 1960.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Jim Swink]] on a [[Fleer]] [[American Football Card|football card]] of 1960]]\nFor the [[1960 Dallas Texans season|Texans' inaugural season]], team owner Lamar Hunt pursued both legendary [[University of Oklahoma]] coach [[Bud Wilkinson]] and [[New York Giants]] defensive assistant [[Tom Landry]] to lead his Texans franchise. Wilkinson opted to stay at Oklahoma, while Landry was destined to coach the NFL's franchise in Dallas. In mid-December 1959 Hunt settled on a relatively unknown assistant coach from the [[Miami Hurricanes football|University of Miami]], [[Hank Stram]]. \"One of the biggest reasons I hired Hank was that he really wanted the job\", Hunt explained. \"It turned out to be a very lucky selection on my part.\"<ref name=\"Chiefs History AFL\"/>\n\nThe Texans were very fortunate to have [[Don Klosterman (American football)|Don Klosterman]] as their head talent man. Klosterman had a penchant for luring star talent away from the NFL, and for finding talent otherwise undiscovered.\n\nReserved seats at the [[Cotton Bowl (stadium)|Cotton Bowl]] cost [[United States Dollars|USD $4]], general admission $2 and high school students paid 90\u00a2 (90 cents) that initial season. [[Don Rossi]] served as the team's [[General Manager (American football)|General Manager]] until November when he was succeeded by [[Jack Steadman]]. The team was headquartered in the [[Mercantile National Bank Building]]. The AFL was also headquartered in Dallas.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nThe Texans conducted their inaugural training camp at the [[New Mexico Military Institute]] in [[Roswell, New Mexico]]. The club embarked on a whirlwind pre-season [[barnstorm (sports)|barnstorm]]ing tour that featured road games in Oakland, [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]], [[Boston]], [[Abilene, Texas|Abilene]] and [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]]. An announced crowd of 51,000 at the Cotton Bowl witnessed a 24\u20133 victory against [[1960 Houston Oilers season|Houston]] on September 2 as the club concluded a perfect 6\u20130 preseason record.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nIn both teams first 1960 season, the Dallas Texans and Dallas Cowboys competed on ticket sales.  For example, according to the book ''Ten-Gallon War'', the Texans offered discounted tickets at department stores and airline offices, free tickets for fill-ups at certain service stations, and even had free tickets \"stuffed inside helium-filled balloons set loose over the city.\"  In competition, the Dallas Cowboys had such promotions as hiring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans for a halftime show.\n<ref name=\"Ten-Gallon War, John Eisenberg, 2012\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=T91c2BFKKzAC&pg=PA118&lpg=PA118&dq=%22stuffed+inside+helium-filled+balloons+set+loose+over+the+city%22&source=bl&ots=WPJ3V-zPFG&sig=Dt2ImLFn2MYlM6e8tO0z6hT1ss0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwik2bHIhtPfAhUrgK0KHUotBGkQ6AEwAHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22stuffed%20inside%20helium-filled%20balloons%20set%20loose%20over%20the%20city%22&f=false Ten-Gallon War: The NFL\u2019s Cowboys, the AFL\u2019s Texans, and the Feud for Dallas's Pro Football Future], John Eisenberg, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2012.</ref>\n\nIn their early years, the Texans had a strong home-state identity with [[quarterback]] [[Cotton Davidson]] from [[Baylor Bears football|Baylor]], [[linebacker]] [[Sherrill Headrick]] from [[TCU Horned Frogs football|TCU]] and [[running back]] [[Abner Haynes]] from [[North Texas Mean Green football|North Texas]]. Haynes led the league with 875 rushing yards and nine TDs, as well as combined net yards (2,100) and punt return average (15.4).<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> The Texans also had a flashy, high-scoring club which finished the year at 8\u20136 as three close losses kept the squad from challenging for the division title. The Texans averaged 24,500 for their home games, the highest average in the league.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> In one attempt to draw more fans to their games, the Texans would offer free tickets to anyone who brought a ticket stub from the previous Friday's high school football game, to counter the NFL Cowboys' playing their home games on Friday night.\n\nIn [[1961 Dallas Texans season|1961]], the Texans and the NFL's Dallas Cowboys both drafted linebacker [[E.J. Holub]] from [[Texas Tech Red Raiders football|Texas Tech]], described by many scouts as \"the best football player in America.\" Holub decided to play for the Texans, joining three future franchise Hall of Famers\u2014[[Jerry Mays (defensive lineman)|Jerry Mays]], [[Fred Arbanas]] and [[Jim Tyrer]]\u2014as part of the club's draft class. The club moved its training camp to Lamar Hunt's [[alma mater]] of [[Southern Methodist University]] and started the regular season at 3\u20131 before hitting a six-game losing skid, the longest such streak of Stram's tenure with the franchise. The Texans rebounded to claim wins in three of its final four contests to finish 6\u20138, marking the club's second straight finish behind the [[1961 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]] in the AFL Western Conference standings.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nIn [[1962 Dallas Texans season|1962]], head coach Hank Stram was named AFL Coach of the Year and running back [[Curtis McClinton]] was named the AFL Rookie of the Year. Haynes became the franchise's first 1,000-yard rusher, concluding the season with 1,049 yards and an AFL-high 13 rushing touchdowns.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nThe Texans clinched their initial AFL Western Division Championship in November and finished with an 11\u20133 regular season record. The team won the [[1962 AFL Championship Game|1962 AFL Championship]] when [[placekicker|kicker]] [[Tommy Brooker]] connected on a 25-yard field goal during the second overtime of the title game, giving the Texans a 20\u201317 victory against the [[1962 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]]. Spanning an elapsed time of 77:54, the game stands as the third-longest contest in pro football history.<ref>Since 1984 the game has been the third-longest professional football game following a triple-overtime [[United States Football League|USFL]] playoff game between the [[Los Angeles Express (USFL)|Los Angeles Express]] and the [[Michigan Panthers]].</ref> Until a [[National Football League Christmas games|Christmas Day]] playoff game in [[1971\u201372 NFL playoffs|1971]] between the [[1971 Kansas City Chiefs season|Chiefs]] and [[1971 Miami Dolphins season|Dolphins]], the game was the longest ever played.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\n===The move to Kansas City===\nThe [[Dallas Cowboys]] joined the NFL as an [[expansion team]] in {{nfly|1960}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=NFL History 1951\u20131960|url=http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1951-1960#1960|publisher=National Football League|date=September 28, 2015|accessdate=September 28, 2015}}</ref> By the end of the 1962 season, it was apparent that Dallas could not support two teams.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> Even though the Texans had been far more successful on the field, Hunt investigated opportunities to move his team elsewhere for the [[1963 Kansas City Chiefs season|1963 season]], including [[Miami]],<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> [[Atlanta]],<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> [[Seattle]] and [[New Orleans]]. Hunt wanted to find a city to which he could commute easily from Dallas, and when he was unable to secure [[Tulane Stadium]] because [[Tulane University|the university]] didn't want its [[Tulane Green Wave football|football program]] to compete with a pro team, he turned to [[Kansas City, Missouri]], where [[Mayor of Kansas City, Missouri|Mayor]] [[H. Roe Bartle]] persuaded him to move to the Midwest.<ref name=\"Chiefs founder\"/>\n\nThe negotiations in Kansas City were conducted in secrecy.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> On several occasions Hunt and Jack Steadman were in Kansas City and met with businessmen, without the general public's knowledge. Bartle introduced Hunt as \"Mr. Lamar\" in all the meetings with other Kansas City businessmen. Steadman was introduced as \"Jack X.\"<ref name=\"Chiefs founder\">Covitz, Randy; Pulliam, Kent. [http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/sports/special_packages/lamar_hunt/16234939.htm Chiefs' founder Lamar Hunt dies] ''Kansas City Star'', 14 December 2006.</ref>\n\nThe support the team received from the Kansas City community before the team announced the move was extraordinary. Hunt made the move dependent upon the ability of Mayor Bartle and the Kansas City community to guarantee him 35,000 in season ticket sales. Hunt had set this number, being that it was the Texans' average attendance at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas. An ambitious campaign took shape to deliver on Bartle's guarantee to Hunt of tripling the season-ticket base the Texans had enjoyed in Dallas. Kansas City's mayor also promised to add 3,000 permanent seats to [[Municipal Stadium (Kansas City)|Municipal Stadium]], as well as 11,000 temporary bleacher seats. Along with Bartle, a number of other prominent Kansas Citians stepped forward to aid in the efforts, putting together more than 1,000 workers to sell season tickets.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nBartle called to his office 20 business leaders and called upon them to form an association later known as \"The Gold Coats\", whose sole objective was to sell and take down payments on the 35,000 season tickets required. \"The Gold Coats\" had to sell season tickets to people without knowing the team name, where it was coming from, who the owner was, which football league they would play in, who the players or coaches were, when the team would play its first game in Kansas City, or where it would play. Hunt gave Bartle a four-month deadline to accomplish the sales. Bartle and \"The Gold Coats\" made good in only 8 weeks. Later, Hunt admitted he was really only hoping for 20,000, for which he still would have moved the franchise. On May 22, Hunt announced he was moving the franchise to [[Kansas City, Missouri]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\">[http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/60s/ Kansas City Chiefs History 1960s\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421185300/http://www.kcchiefs.com/history/60s/ |date=2007-04-21 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:DallasTexansFootballClubNamingContestChiefs.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Football Club Naming Contest Letter from Lamar Hunt]]\nHunt, with a roster replete with players who had played college football in Texas, wanted to maintain a lineage to the team's roots and wanted to name the club the '''Kansas City Texans'''.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\" /> \"The [[Los Angeles Lakers|Lakers]] stayed the Lakers when they moved from Minnesota to California\", he reasoned. \"But Jack Steadman convinced me that wasn't too smart. It wouldn't sell.\" The team was renamed the '''Kansas City Chiefs'''\u2014one of the most popular suggestions Hunt received in a name-the-team contest.<ref name=\"Chiefs founder\" />  Lamar Hunt sent letters dated June 21, 1963, to all the contest entrants who selected the name CHIEFS in the \"Rename the Texans\" contest of whom Mrs. Joan Feuerborn was one of those entrants, and along with their respective guesses as to the number of season tickets sold by May 1. The actual total was 10,808, and based on this the car winner was Mr. E. L. Diemler of Kansas City, Missouri, a warehouse manager who got the idea when making out a bill of lading to Chief Freight Lines.<ref>Flanagan, Jeffrey. Name-the-Chiefs winner was inspired by freight. KansasCity.com. 16 Jan 2007.</ref>  Another name also considered at the time for the team was the '''Kansas City Mules'''.<ref name=\"Chiefs founder\" />\n\nThe name, \"Chiefs\" is not only derived from a fan contest, but also from Mayor Bartle, who 35 years prior, founded the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]-based honor society known as ''The [[Tribe of Mic-O-Say]]'' within the [[Scouting in Missouri|Boy Scouts of America]] organization, which earned him the nickname, \"The Chief.\"<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nThe Chiefs moved into Municipal Stadium, located at 22nd and Brooklyn, which opened in 1923 and had 49,002 seats. The Chiefs shared the facilities with the [[Kansas City Athletics]] of [[Major League Baseball]]. The first appearance of the Chiefs in Municipal Stadium attracted just 5,721 fans for a 17\u201313 pre-season victory against [[1963 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo]] on August 9.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nThe Chiefs' inaugural season in Kansas City began with owner Lamar Hunt's trade of starting quarterback [[Cotton Davidson]] to the Oakland Raiders, which landed the number one overall selection in the [[1963 AFL Draft|AFL Draft]] (which they used to select [[Buck Buchanan]]). Ironically, the Raiders would later select [[Gene Upshaw]] in [[1967 AFL Draft|1967]] for the express purpose of blocking Buchanan.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> The Chiefs also selected guard [[Ed Budde]] from [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] with their other first round pick, and [[Bobby Bell]] from [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|Minnesota]] in the seventh round. Buchanan, Budde and Bell all became starters on their way to a combined 526 games with the team and all three of them played their entire careers with the Chiefs.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nTragedy struck the club when rookie running back [[Stone Johnson]], who was a sprinter in the [[1960 Summer Olympics]] in Rome, suffered a fractured vertebra in his neck in a pre-season game against [[1963 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland]] on August 30 in [[Wichita, Kansas]]. He died 10 days later on September 8 and his jersey number 33 was subsequently retired.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> The Chiefs finished their first season in Kansas City with a 5\u20137\u20132 record and failed to reappear in the AFL Championship game for a consecutive year.\n\n===Building a champion, 1964\u20131969===\nIn [[1964 Kansas City Chiefs season|1964]], the Chiefs began the year with a 2\u20131 mark before dropping three consecutive games as several of the team's best players, including [[E.J. Holub]], [[Fred Arbanas]] and [[Johnny Robinson (safety)|Johnny Robinson]] missed numerous games with injuries. Arbanas missed the final two games of the year after undergoing surgery to his left eye, in which he suffered almost total loss of vision. Running back [[Mack Lee Hill]], who signed with the club as a rookie free agent and received a mere $300 signing bonus, entered the starting lineup and earned a spot in the [[AFL All-Star Game]]. The club rounded out the season with two consecutive wins to close the season at 7\u20137, finishing second in the AFL Western Conference behind the [[1964 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]]. An average of just 18,126 fans attended each home game at Municipal Stadium, prompting discussion at the AFL owners' meeting about the Chiefs future in Kansas City.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nFor the [[1965 Kansas City Chiefs season|1965 season]], the Chiefs were once again caught in the middle of the AFL and NFL's bidding wars for college talent. Kansas City made running back [[Gale Sayers]] from the [[Kansas Jayhawks football|University of Kansas]] their first-round draft pick, but Sayers eventually signed with the Bears for less money.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> Running back [[Mack Lee Hill]] suffered torn ligaments in his right knee in the second to last regular season game of the year at Buffalo on December 12. Following what was expected to be a routine surgery on December 14 at Menorah Hospital in Kansas City, Hill died from what was termed \"a sudden and massive [[embolism]].\" Hunt called Hill's death \"the worst shock possible.\" Beginning the following year, the club annually bestowed the Mack Lee Hill Award on its top rookie or first-year performer in Hill's honor. Just days after Hill's unexpected death, the mourning Chiefs defeated the [[Denver Broncos]] on December 19 to finish the year with a 7\u20135\u20132 record.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nIn [[1966 Kansas City Chiefs season|1966]], the Chiefs were beginning to lay the groundwork for a return to the AFL Championship game and eventual dominance in the later years of the AFL. Team owner Lamar Hunt was publicly negotiating with NFL Commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] about a possible merger of the two leagues. [[Defensive end]] [[Aaron Brown (defensive lineman)|Aaron Brown]] was highly coveted by many clubs, including the NFL's [[Pittsburgh Steelers|Steelers]], who intended to select him. The Steelers couldn't locate Brown on draft day since he was already aboard a flight with Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt, who carried out the first mid-air signing in team history. The Chiefs signed [[Heisman Trophy]]-winning running back [[Mike Garrett]] in the 20th round of the [[1966 AFL Draft]]. Garrett went on to earn AFL Rookie of the Year honors for the 1966 season.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nThe Chiefs started the season at 3\u20130. A crowd of 43,885 attended the Chiefs home opener against the defending AFL Champion [[1966 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] on October 2, the largest ever to witness a sports event in Kansas City at the time. The Chiefs dropped a 29\u201314 decision to the Bills, but after the contest, Chiefs coach Hank Stram and Buffalo head coach [[Joe Collier]] negotiated a trade in the middle of the field. Kansas City received placekicker [[Mike Mercer (American football)|Mike Mercer]] for a fifth-round pick. Chiefs quarterback [[Len Dawson]] led the league in passing, while [[Otis Taylor (American football)|Otis Taylor]] became the first 1,000-yard receiver in franchise history, registering 1,297 yards. The Chiefs finished three games in front of Oakland to claim an AFL Western Conference title with an 11\u20132\u20131 record, setting the stage for the franchise's second trip to the [[1966 American Football League Championship Game|AFL Championship Game]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 15 - Willie Davis (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|The Chiefs and the Packers in the first AFL\u2013NFL Championship Game (Super Bowl I)]]\nUsing a dazzling [[I-formation|I-formation offense]] and a smothering defense, the Chiefs claimed a dominating 31\u20137 victory in the AFL title game at Buffalo on [[New Year's Day]], 1967. That victory propelled Kansas City to the [[Super Bowl I|first AFL-NFL World Championship Game]], later known as the [[Super Bowl]]. At the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], the Chiefs met [[Vince Lombardi]]'s powerful [[Green Bay Packers]] of the National Football League on January 15, 1967. The Chiefs played the Packers close for a half, trailing 14\u201310, but Green Bay took control in the final two quarters, winning the game by a score of 35\u201310.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nFor [[1967 Kansas City Chiefs season|1967]], the club's special teams got a boost with the addition of kicker [[Jan Stenerud]], and [[kick returner]] [[Noland Smith|Noland \"Super Gnat\" Smith]]. The Chiefs' first regular season game against an NFL team resulted in a commanding 66\u201324 Chiefs victory against the [[1967 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] at Municipal Stadium on August 23. Injuries again hit the club hard during the regular season as the Chiefs clawed their way to a 9\u20135 record.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nInterest in the team skyrocketed following the team's appearance in the AFL-NFL Championship Game, forcing an increase in [[seating capacity]] at Municipal Stadium from 40,000 to 47,000. In June, [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]] voters approved a $43 million bond issue for construction of a sports complex<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> to be completed by 1972. Eastern Jackson County was chosen as the site of the Chiefs and Royals' new stadiums, and groundbreaking ceremonies took place in July with plans calling for a unique \"rolling roof\" design (which was later scrapped).\n\nThe [[1968 Kansas City Chiefs season|1968 Chiefs]] defense allowed a franchise-low 170 points (12.1 ppg). The nucleus of the defensive unit was in its prime, producing six AFL All-Stars, including all three of the squad's linebackers. Offensively, quarterback [[Len Dawson]] led the AFL in passing for the fourth time. The Chiefs began the season with a 7\u20131 record and rattled off five straight victories to close the regular season at 12\u20132, sharing the AFL Western Conference title with the [[1968 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] and setting up a one-game playoff between the two teams. Kansas City lost a 41\u20136 decision at Oakland on December 22 as the Raiders advanced to the [[American Football League playoffs#1968 Championship|1968 AFL Championship Game]] against the [[1968 New York Jets season|New York Jets]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> The loss to Oakland is considered to be the beginning of the [[Chiefs-Raiders rivalry|Chiefs' rivalry with the Raiders]], one of the NFL's most [[National Football League rivalries|bitter feuds]].\n\nThe Chiefs used the momentum they built during the 1968 campaign by posting a perfect 6\u20130 record during pre-season play for [[1969 Kansas City Chiefs season|1969]]. The team began the regular season with four consecutive road games for the only time in team history. After a decisive 27\u20139 win at [[1969 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego]] on September 14, the club posted a 31\u20130 shutout at [[1969 Boston Patriots season|Boston]] on September 21. During the game, quarterback Len Dawson sustained a knee injury which would sideline him for the following two months.\n\nThe once-optimistic picture for the Chiefs went from bad to worse the following week when back-up quarterback [[Jacky Lee (American football)|Jacky Lee]] went down with a broken ankle in a 24\u201319 loss at [[1969 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati]] on September 28. That injury left the team's most crucial position in the hands of second-year quarterback [[Mike Livingston]], who took just five snaps as a rookie in 1968.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/> However, Livingston engineered a five-game winning streak, while getting plenty of help from the club's defense. The team's home opener was played in a day-long deluge referred to as a \"frog-strangler\" by Chiefs radio broadcaster [[Bill Grigsby]]. The Chiefs and [[1969 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]] combined for 14 fumbles in a 24\u20130 Kansas City victory on October 12. Len Dawson returned to the starting lineup in a 27\u20133 win against San Diego on November 9 and guided the club to three wins in the season's next four games.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\nThe Chiefs defeated the [[1969 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] 31\u201317 on [[NFL Thanksgiving Classic|Thanksgiving Day]]. Trailing 24\u201317 late in the game, Denver attempted an [[onside kick]] that was recovered by linebacker Bobby Bell, who promptly returned that kick for a 53-yard [[touchdown]]. Mike Livingston started the following week against [[1969 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo]] on December 7 for an again-injured Dawson, who returned for the regular season finale at Oakland on December 13. A 10\u20136 loss against the Raiders gave the Chiefs an 11\u20133 record, good for second in the AFC Western Conference behind [[1969 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland]] (12\u20131\u20131).<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1960's\"/>\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | footer = The Chiefs topped the Raiders in the [[1969 American Football League Championship Game|1969 AFL championship game]] (''left'') and went on to defeat the Vikings in Super Bowl IV (''right'').\n | footer_align = left\n | image1 = 1986 Jeno's Pizza - 49 - Robert Holmes.jpg\n | width1 = 140\n | image2 =1986 Jeno's Pizza - 50 - Buck Buchanan and Curley Culp.jpg\n | width2 = 140\n}}\nIn an AFL Divisional Playoff Game at [[1969 New York Jets season|New York]], Kansas City rode its dominating defense which produced a crucial goal-line stand en route to a 13\u20136 win over the [[Super Bowl III|defending Super Bowl champion]] Jets to set up a rematch with the Raiders in the [[1969 AFL Championship|final AFL Championship Game]]. Looking for retribution of the previous losses in the regular season and in the 1968 playoffs, the Chiefs became the league's only three-time champions, defeating the Raiders by a 17\u20137 count at Oakland on January 4, 1970.\n\nDuring the days preceding Kansas City's clash with the [[spread betting|heavily favored]] [[1969 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] of the NFL, unsubstantiated media reports associating Len Dawson with a known gambler hounded the Chiefs quarterback.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Dawson was later revealed to be mistaken for another man with the same last name. The night before Super Bowl IV, [[Ed Sabol]] of [[NFL Films]] approached Vikings coach [[Bud Grant]] about being wired for sound for the game. Grant declined, but Chiefs coach [[Hank Stram]] accepted. As both the Chiefs and the cameras rolled, Stram clamored for his team to run \"65 toss power trap\" and to \"keep matriculating the ball down the field.\"<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Stram became the first-ever coach to be wired for NFL Films, and ironically, as a coach in the rival AFL.\n\nThe Chiefs used the game as a crusade for the American Football League and wore \"AFL-10\" patches honoring the league's 10-year existence. The Chiefs used three field goals from Jan Stenerud and a rushing touchdown from Mike Garrett to take a 16\u20130 halftime lead. A dynamic 46-yard TD pass from Len Dawson to Otis Taylor in the third quarter sealed the victory as Dawson was named the game's [[Super Bowl MVP|Most Valuable Player]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Perhaps the grittiest performance of the day came from [[safety (American football position)|safety]] [[Johnny Robinson (safety)|Johnny Robinson]], who registered two interceptions and a fumble recovery despite playing with three broken ribs. At approximately 5:20 PM, the final seconds ticked off the clock at [[Tulane Stadium]] as the Chiefs were crowned World Champions by claiming a 23\u20137 victory in the final game between the AFL and NFL.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> A victory parade ensued upon the club's triumphant return the following day in [[downtown Kansas City]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> [[Super Bowl IV]] was the last championship won by the Chiefs until [[Super Bowl LIV]],\n\n==Alignment to the NFL==\n\n===Fall from glory, 1970\u20131977===\nFollowing their championship win, the NFL-AFL merger placed the Chiefs in the newly created AFC West division with the Chargers, Raiders, and Broncos. The team traded running back Mike Garrett to San Diego in [[1970 Kansas City Chiefs season|1970]] and replaced him in the lineup with [[Ed Podolak]]. Despite a 44\u201324 win against [[1970 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore]] on September 28 in just the second-ever telecast of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' package, the Chiefs owned a 3\u20133\u20131 record at the season's midpoint. The Chiefs and the [[1970 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] tied a game at 17\u201317 on November 1 following a controversial play from Oakland. The Chiefs were ahead 17\u201314 when Len Dawson apparently sealed the win, running for a first down which would have allowed Kansas City to run out the clock. While on the ground, Dawson was speared by Raiders defensive end [[Ben Davidson]] in an infamous incident that cost the Chiefs a victory and further inflamed the already heated Chiefs-Raiders rivalry.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Wide receiver Otis Taylor retaliated and a bench-clearing brawl ensued. Offsetting penalties were called, nullifying Dawson's first down. The Chiefs were forced to punt and Raiders kicker [[George Blanda]] booted a game-tying field goal with eight seconds remaining. That tie ultimately cost the Chiefs the opportunity to split the AFC West division title with Oakland as Kansas City finished the year with a 7\u20135\u20132 record, while the Raiders went 8\u20134\u20132 and reached the conference championship.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\n{{quote box\n| quote = I always thought that our best team was the peak of our best team, our '71 squad.\n| source = -[[Lamar Hunt]]<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n| align = left\n| width = 30%\n| salign = right\n}}\n\nIn [[1971 Kansas City Chiefs season|1971]], the Chiefs were regarded by many as the finest squad ever assembled by the franchise, including team owner Lamar Hunt. The team featured a franchise record 11 Pro Bowlers. Offensively, wide receiver Otis Taylor led the league with 1,110 receiving yards. In just his third pro season, Ed Podolak surpassed Abner Haynes as the all-time leading rusher in team history. The longstanding linebacking trio of Willie Lanier, Bobby Bell and Jim Lynch was the league's best. The offensive line was headlined by guard Ed Budde and tackle Jim Tyrer, while the defensive front featured a pair of Pro Bowlers in tackles Buck Buchanan and [[Curley Culp]].

A 16\u201314 victory against Oakland on December 12 gave the franchise its initial AFC West title.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> The great promise of the 1971 campaign ended dramatically in [[1971\u201372 NFL playoffs#AFC: Miami Dolphins 27.2C Kansas City Chiefs 24 .282OT.29|the longest game]] in NFL history, an AFC Divisional Playoff Game played on Christmas Day against the [[1971 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]]. It took 82:40<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> to finish the contest, but a 37-yard field goal from Dolphins kicker [[Garo Yepremian]] finally ended this epic as Miami claimed a 27\u201324 double [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]] win in the final football contest played at Kansas City's Municipal Stadium. Chiefs' running back Ed Podolak accounted for 350 combined net yards, a figure that remains an NFL post-season record.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> The baton of power in the AFC was officially passed to the Dolphins, who went on to appear in three consecutive Super Bowls. It would be the Chiefs' last playoff appearance for 15 years, effectively signaling the conclusion of the franchise's glory days.\n\nIn [[1972 Kansas City Chiefs season|1972]], the last original member of the 1960 Dallas Texans team departed when safety [[Johnny Robinson (safety)|Johnny Robinson]] announced his retirement at training camp. Meanwhile, starting quarterback Len Dawson ended speculation about his retirement by signing a two-year contract. Franchise owner Lamar Hunt became the first AFL figure to be inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] on July 29.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nAfter two different construction strikes and a myriad of other delays, [[Arrowhead Stadium]] was officially dedicated on August 12 when the Chiefs registered a 24\u201314 victory against the [[1972 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|St. Louis Cardinals]]. Running back Ed Podolak scored the first touchdown in the facility. Regular season ticket prices for the team's first season at Arrowhead were [[USD]]$8 for box seats and $7 for reserved seating.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nOn September 17, the Chiefs lost a 20\u201310 decision against Miami in the first regular season game at Arrowhead in front of a crowd of 79,829.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> A standing-room-only crowd of 82,094 fans was in attendance for a 27\u201314 victory against [[1972 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland]] on November 5, the largest \"in-house\" attendance total for an NFL contest in Arrowhead's history.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> After a 5\u20133 start, a three-game losing streak effectively eliminated the club from playoff contention, including an embarrassing home loss to the winless Philadelphia Eagles. An 8\u20136 record was good enough for only a second-place finish in the AFC West behind Oakland. Linebacker Willie Lanier became the first Chiefs player to receive the NFL Man of the Year Award in the offseason.\n\n[[File:Kansas City Chiefs at Denver Broncos 1985-12-14 (ticket) (crop).jpg|thumb|left|Dawson pictured later in his career with the Chiefs]]\nFor [[1973 Kansas City Chiefs season|1973]], quarterback Mike Livingston started in a 23\u201313 Opening Day loss against [[1973 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles]], but Len Dawson returned to rally the club for three consecutive wins to get the club off to a 3\u20131 start for a third consecutive year. The aging Len Dawson made his final start of the year in a 23\u201314 loss at [[1973 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo]] on October 29 on ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' and was replaced for the remainder of the year by Livingston, beginning a string of three straight seasons in which both players split time at the position.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Livingston led the club to another three straight wins, putting the team in first place in mid-November with a 6\u20133\u20131 record. A 1\u20132\u20131 ledger over the season's final month ended the club's post-season aspirations as the team finished the year in a second-place tie with [[1973 Denver Broncos season|Denver]] at 7\u20135\u20132. Len Dawson became the second Chiefs player in as many years to win the NFL Man of the Year Award. Following [[Super Bowl VIII]], The [[1974 Pro Bowl|AFC-NFC Pro Bowl]] was held at Arrowhead Stadium on January 20 with the AFC claiming a 15\u201313 win thanks to five field goals from Miami placekicker Garo Yepremian.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nWhile the club's sparkling new facility at Arrowhead Stadium was drawing rave reviews, the Chiefs roster was beginning to show its age in [[1974 Kansas City Chiefs season|1974]]. The result was the team's first losing season in 11 years as the club was unable to string together consecutive victories during the year, a first in franchise history.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Most of the team's starters were advancing in age: Len Dawson was 39, Jim Tyrer was 35, Bobby Bell, Buck Buchanan, and Ed Budde were 34, Dave Hill was 33 and Otis Taylor was 32.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nOne of the year's few bright spots in the 5\u20139 season was cornerback [[Emmitt Thomas]], who led the league with a franchise-record 12 interceptions. The final game of the 1974 campaign marked the final time all five of Kansas City's future Hall of Fame players from the club's AFL championship era took the field together with coach Hank Stram. Including Lamar Hunt and five future Minnesota Vikings Hall of Famers, an amazing total of 12 Hall of Fame inductees were involved in that 1974 season finale game. That 35\u201315 loss against Super Bowl-bound [[1974 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]] provided an anticlimactic conclusion to Hank Stram's illustrious coaching career in Kansas City. Stram, the only head coach in franchise history was relieved of his duties on December 27 after compiling a 124\u201376\u201310 regular season record with the club.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\n[[San Francisco 49ers]] defensive coordinator [[Paul Wiggin]] was named the second head coach in franchise history on January 23, [[1975 Kansas City Chiefs season|1975]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Wiggin inherited the unenviable task of rebuilding a squad whose pool of talent had been largely depleted due to age and a number of ill-considered trades that had left the club devoid of first-round draft choices in [[1973 NFL Draft|1973]] and [[1975 NFL Draft|1975]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> After an 0\u20133 start to the season, Wiggin directed the Chiefs to three straight wins, beginning with a convincing 42\u201310 victory against the [[1975 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]]. The highlight of the season was a 34\u201331 upset win at Dallas on ''Monday Night Football''. The club could not maintain the early success; owning a 5\u20135 record heading into the home stretch of the season, injuries to a number of key players crippled the team. The team dropped its final four contests of the year to finish at 5\u20139 for the second consecutive season. The regular season finale at Oakland marked the final games in the Hall of Fame careers of Len Dawson and Buck Buchanan.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nBy [[1976 Kansas City Chiefs season|1976]], many of the Chiefs' championship players were on their way out of Kansas City. Buck Buchanan announced his retirement in February, while Dawson announced his own departure on May 1.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Off the field, Jack Steadman was promoted to team president and [[Jim Schaaf]] was named general manager in August. On the field, Kansas City's fortunes didn't improve in the second year of the Wiggin regime. The club dropped three straight home games, including a 27\u201317 loss to a [[1976 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] team coached by Stram, before suffering a 50\u201317 setback at [[1976 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo]] on October 3, opening the season at 0\u20134 for the first time in team history.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> The team registered a 3\u20131 record during a successful midseason stretch, but like most of the previous seasons, could not maintain that momentum.\n\nAfter lingering in Len Dawson's shadow for eight seasons, Mike Livingston was firmly entrenched as the team's starting quarterback, becoming the first QB to start every regular season game since Dawson in 1968. Although Livingston played well and rallied the squad for wins in two of the season's final three games, the Chiefs still ended the year with their third consecutive 5\u20139 record.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Running back [[MacArthur Lane]] was the club's top offensive threat, becoming the only player at the time in franchise history to lead the league in receptions (66).\n\nOn the field, the Chiefs suffered their worst season ever in [[1977 Kansas City Chiefs season|1977]], winning just twice and undergoing a mid-season coaching change. Following three consecutive 5\u20139 seasons, the team finished with a league worst 2\u201312 record. An 0\u20135 start doomed the squad with a 44\u20137 loss at Cleveland, where Wiggin starred as a defensive lineman during the Browns' glory days, effectively sealing the coach's fate. Wiggin was relieved of his duties on [[Halloween]], marking the only in-season coaching switch in team history.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Defensive backs coach [[Tom Bettis]] was named interim coach and claimed a 20\u201310 victory against Green Bay in the club's initial contest under his direction, but it was the only victory of his brief head coaching tenure.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nBettis and the remainder of the coaching staff assembled by Wiggin were relieved on December 19, one day after a 21\u201320 loss at Oakland in the regular season finale.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> [[Marv Levy]], the former head coach of the [[Canadian Football League]]'s [[Montreal Alouettes]], was named the fourth head coach in franchise history the following day. The heart and soul of the Chiefs once-vaunted defense departed when Willie Lanier and Jim Lynch retired following the season.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\n===Signs of improvement, 1978\u20131982===\nFor [[1978 Kansas City Chiefs season|1978]], Marv Levy's systematic restocking of a relatively barren defensive roster began with a [[1978 NFL Draft|1978 draft class]] that included defensive end [[Art Still]] and linebacker [[Gary Spani]]. Running back Ed Podolak, who was the club's all-time leading rusher at the time, retired in the offseason on June 15.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nPerhaps Levy's most unconventional tactic in rebuilding the Chiefs was installing the \"[[Wing-T offense]]\". \"It was a situation where we took over a team that had the worst defensive record in the history of the National Football League\", Levy explained. \"We wanted to keep that defense off the field, so we ran the ball 60 times a game.\"<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> The 1978 Chiefs team ran and ran often, posting franchise records with 663 rushing attempts and 2,986 ground yards.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Levy's squad ran the ball a staggering 69 times in a 24\u201323 Opening Day win at Cincinnati on September 3, the most rushing attempts in an NFL contest since [[1948 NFL season|1948]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Five different players had 100-yard rushing games during the year, including running back [[Tony Reed]], who finished the season with 1,053 yards to become the team's first 1,000-yard back since 1967.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> Despite the squad's Opening Day success, the club lost 10 of its next 11 games, including a pair of overtime decisions. However, the team showed signs of improvement with the defense recording a 23\u20130 shutout against [[1978 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego]] on November 26 as the club concluded its first 16-game schedule with a 4\u201312 mark.\n\nIn [[1979 Kansas City Chiefs season|1979]], Kansas City owned a pair of picks in the first round of the [[1979 NFL Draft|Draft]], selecting defensive end [[Mike Bell (defensive lineman)|Mike Bell]] and quarterback [[Steve Fuller (football player)|Steve Fuller]]. By the season's third game, Fuller had supplanted Mike Livingston as the club's starter.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nWith Fuller at the helm, the Chiefs owned a 4\u20132 record after six games, but a five-game mid-season losing stretch sullied that effort. Despite finishing fifth in the AFC West for a second straight season, Kansas City's 7\u20139 record was a notable accomplishment considering the fact that the division's other four clubs all posted winning records for a second consecutive season.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/> The Chiefs lost a 3\u20130 decision at [[1979 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay]] on December 16 in one of the most water-logged contests in franchise annals. As both clubs struggled to move the ball under monsoon-like conditions, a late, fourth-quarter field goal by the Buccaneers averted the NFL's first scoreless tie since [[1943 NFL season|1943]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1970's\"/>\n\nIn [[1980 Kansas City Chiefs season|1980]], the Chiefs selected guard [[Brad Budde]] in the first round of the [[1980 NFL Draft|Draft]], the son of former Chiefs guard Ed Budde, as the team's first-round draft choice, making the Buddes the first father-son combination to become first-round draftees of the same team in NFL history.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> In a then-controversial move on August 26, the Chiefs released placekicker Jan Stenerud, who at the time was club's all-time leading scorer. He was replaced by journeyman [[Nick Lowery]], who had been cut 11 times by eight different teams himself.\n\nAfter enduring an 0\u20134 start, the club rebounded to post a four-game winning streak, starting with a 31\u201317 victory in Oakland, in which Raiders quarterback [[Dan Pastorini]] broke his leg and was replaced by [[Jim Plunkett]], who guided the team to the [[Super Bowl XV]] championship. After Steve Fuller was sidelined with a knee injury late in the season, former Miami 12th-round draft choice [[Bill Kenney]] became the team's starting quarterback. He was so anonymous that when he appeared in that contest, the name on the back of his jersey was inadvertently misspelled \"Kenny.\"<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Kenney went on to lead the club to a 31\u201314 victory against Denver on December 7 in his initial NFL start. The defense continued to evolve as defensive end Art Still and safety [[Gary Barbaro]] became the first Chiefs defensive players to be elected to the Pro Bowl in five seasons.

Second-round draft choice, running back [[Joe Delaney]] electrified the club's offense by rushing for 1,121 yards, a team single-season record at the time.

Bill Kenney missed the club's final three contests due to injury as Steve Fuller temporarily reclaimed the starting QB position and guided the club to a 10\u20136 win at Minnesota, in the final contest played at [[Metropolitan Stadium]]. With the Chiefs winning the game, Vikings fans began dismembering the stadium as early as the second half\u2014taking seats, pieces of the scoreboard and even chunks of sod as souvenirs.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> The victory assured the Chiefs of a 9\u20137 record, the club's first winning mark since 1973 as coach Marv Levy increased the club's victory total for a third consecutive year. Inspired by the [[Washington Redskins]]'s \"[[Hail to the Redskins]]\", Levy penned a fight song for the Chiefs (\"Give a Cheer for Kansas City\"), but much like the team's Wing-T offense, the concept never really caught on.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\nIn [[1982 Kansas City Chiefs season|1982]], running back Joe Delaney underwent surgery to repair a detached retina in his eye, a radical procedure at the time.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Optimism abounded at Arrowhead thanks to the club's promising 9\u20137 record from 1981, but swelling labor unrest from NFL players spelled doom for both the Chiefs and Levy in 1982. The Chiefs split their first two games of the year before a 57-day [[1982 NFL strike|strike]] by the [[NFL Players Association]] began at midnight on September 20. The strike concluded on November 17 after six games were canceled and one was rescheduled, but the Chiefs would never recover, dropping four straight games after their return to the field. Center [[Jack Rudnay]], who had been one of the franchise's most durable and decorated offensive performers over the past decade, announced on December 20 that he would retire after the season. Despite wins in two of the season's final three games, the Levy era concluded as the club finished the strike-shortened campaign at 3\u20136.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\n===Unbalanced chemistry, 1983\u20131988===\n\n====1983====\n{{details|1983 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nTo begin 1983, the Chiefs fired head coach Marv Levy on January 4 after compiling a 31\u201342 record. [[Dallas Cowboys]] quarterbacks coach [[John Mackovic]] was named the fifth head coach in team history on February 2. The 39-year-old Mackovic became the youngest individual ever to hold that post for the club.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> The Chiefs held the seventh overall pick in the quarterback-laden [[1983 NFL Draft]] and selected [[Todd Blackledge]]. The five other signal-callers selected in the first round that year included [[John Elway]], [[Jim Kelly]], [[Tony Eason]], [[Ken O'Brien]] and [[Dan Marino]].\n\nTragedy struck the club on June 29 when Joe Delaney [[drowned]] trying to save the lives of three youngsters in [[Monroe, Louisiana]]. Delaney was [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] awarded the Presidential Citizen's Medal by [[Ronald Reagan]] on July 13.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Linebacker Bobby Bell became the first Chiefs player to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on July 30,<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> providing some solace for the mourning Chiefs fan base following Joe Delaney's death.\n\nWith Kenney and Blackledge both on the roster, starting QB Steve Fuller was traded to the [[Los Angeles Rams]] on August 19. Kenney earned a Pro Bowl berth after racking up a franchise-record 4,348 passing yards, while wide receiver [[Carlos Carson]] hauled in 80 passes for 1,351 yards.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Despite the team's high-flying passing game, head coach John Mackovic had trouble finding a suitable replacement for Joe Delaney and the running back position. The highest scoring contest in franchise history took place as the Chiefs and [[1983 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] combined for 99 points in a wild, 51\u201348 overtime loss at the [[Kingdome]]. A meager crowd of 11,377 attended the club's season-ending 48\u201317 win against [[1983 Denver Broncos season|Denver]] on December 18, the smallest attendance figure ever for a Chiefs game at Arrowhead as the club finished the year at 6\u201310.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\n====1984====\n{{details|1984 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nPro Bowl safety [[Gary Barbaro]] became the most notable Chiefs player to defect to the rival [[United States Football League]], signing with the [[New Jersey Generals]] on February 2 after sitting out the entire 1983 campaign in a contract dispute.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Barbaro's departure and the trade of cornerback [[Gary Green (American football)|Gary Green]] began a youth movement that produced the most vaunted secondary in team history. Cornerbacks [[Kevin Ross (American football)|Kevin Ross]] and [[Albert Lewis (American football)|Albert Lewis]], and safeties [[Deron Cherry]] and [[Lloyd Burruss]] accounted for a combined 13 Pro Bowl appearances for the Chiefs<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> in the years to come.\n\nAll-America defensive tackle [[Bill Maas]] and offensive tackle [[John Alt]] were both selected in the first round of the [[1984 NFL Draft]]. Maas was named [[NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year]], while Alt eventually became the cornerstone of the club's offensive line later in the decade. Kansas City's defense registered a team-record 11.0 sacks in a 10\u20136 win against Cleveland on September 30, coming one sack shy of the NFL single-game record.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\nQuarterback Bill Kenney suffered a broken thumb during the preseason and was sidelined until the season's seventh week. Second year back-up QB Todd Blackledge opened the first six contests of the season and had the club at 3\u20133. Kenney returned to the starting lineup against the [[1984 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] on October 21, but inconsistency marked the rest of the season as the club dropped four of first five contests after his return. However, the team rattled off three consecutive wins to conclude the year at 8\u20138.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\n====1985====\n[[File:Kansas City Chiefs at Denver Broncos 1985-12-14 (ticket).jpg|thumb|right|100px|A ticket for a 1985 game between the Chiefs and the Denver Broncos]]\n{{details|1985 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nThe Chiefs got off to a flying start in [[1985 NFL season|1985]] with a 47\u201327 win at [[1985 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans]], while safety [[Deron Cherry]] tied an NFL record by registering four interceptions in a 28\u20137 win against [[1985 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle]] on September 29 as the club boasted a 3\u20131 record four games into the season.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> The club was then confronted with a seven-game losing streak that wasn't snapped until QB Todd Blackledge was installed as the starter against [[1985 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis]] on November 24. The team rebounded to win three of its final five contests of the year with Blackledge under center, further inflaming a quarterback controversy that continued into the 1986 season.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\nOne of the few remaining bright spots in a disappointing 6\u201310 season came in the regular season finale against [[1985 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego]] when wide receiver [[Stephone Paige]] set an NFL record with 309 receiving yards in a 38\u201334 win, breaking the previous mark of 303 yards set by [[Cleveland Browns|Cleveland's]] [[Jim Benton (American football)|Jim Benton]] in [[1945 NFL season|1945]]. Paige's mark was subsequently surpassed by a 336-yard effort by [[Flipper Anderson]] (L.A.

On the field, the pieces started coming together for head coach John Mackovic. His offense displayed plenty of scoring punch, while the club's defense and special teams became increasingly effective.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> With the team sitting at 3\u20133, Bill Kenney replaced Todd Blackledge for the second half of the season in a game against San Diego,<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> guiding the club to a 42\u201341 victory. That win was the first of four consecutive triumphs with Kenney at the helm, the club's longest winning streak since 1980. Poised with a 7\u20133 record after 10 games, three straight losses in November put the Chiefs playoff chances in jeopardy. Two December wins gave Kansas City a 9\u20136 mark, putting the Chiefs on the verge of their first postseason berth in 15 years.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\nThe defining moment of the season came in the regular season finale at [[1986 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh]] on December 21.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Despite being outgained in total yardage by a 515-to-171-yard margin, the Chiefs were able to notch a 24\u201319 victory as all of the team's points came via special teams on a blocked punt return, a field goal, a kickoff return and a blocked field goal return.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> With a 10\u20136 record the Chiefs earned an AFC Wild Card berth, winning a tiebreaker with Seattle. Bill Kenney was injured in the fourth quarter of the Steelers contest, meaning Todd Blackledge would draw the starting assignment for the club's first playoff contest since 1971, a 35\u201315 loss at [[1985 New York Jets season|New York]].\n\n====1987====\n{{details|1987 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nOne of the most tumultuous weeks in franchise history took place following the club's playoff loss against the Jets. Assistant head coach and special teams coach [[Frank Gansz]], resigned his position on January 7 in order to pursue opportunities as an NFL offensive coordinator.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> The following day, the Chiefs announced in an impromptu press conference that John Mackovic was relieved of his duties as head coach on January 8. A popular figure among Chiefs players, Gansz was reinstated on January 10 and was named the sixth head coach in franchise history.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\nFormer quarterback Len Dawson became the third Chiefs player inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on August 8,<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> while injuries forced the retirement of the club's all-time leading tackler Gary Spani. A duo of rookies made a splash in a 20\u201313 win on Opening Day against San Diego as running back [[Paul Palmer (American football)|Paul Palmer]] returned a kickoff for a TD and [[Christian Okoye]] dashed for 105 yards.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> A 24-day players strike began on September 22, effectively canceling the club's contest against [[1987 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Replacement players participated in games for the next three weeks. Much like Marv Levy five years earlier, Gansz's grip on the club's coaching reins was crippled by the labor unrest.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\nKansas City's replacement squad consisted primarily of players cut in training camp. One of the few bright spots among this motley crew was running back Jitter Fields, who remained on the active roster following the strike.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> The Chiefs strike squad received an ominous welcome in Los Angeles when in the early morning hours of October 4, the day prior to a contest against the Raiders, an earthquake rattled [[Southern California]]. The shaken Chiefs lost a 35\u201317 decision later that day. The low point of the year came the following week at Miami in the first regular season game played at what then was known as [[Joe Robbie Stadium]]. Chiefs replacement QB [[Matt Stevens (quarterback)|Matt Stevens]] was injured early in the contest, forcing into duty QB [[Alex Espinoza]], a player who had never taken an NFL snap. The result was a 42\u20130 Dolphins victory, setting the stage for an 0\u20133 performance by Kansas City's replacement unit, giving the Chiefs a 1\u20134 record before the club's regular roster returned at San Diego on October 25.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Five straight losses followed, giving the Chiefs a team-record nine-game losing skid. For the only time in team history, five different players started games at quarterback for the club.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Behind Kenney, Kansas City won two of its last three games to conclude the [[1987 NFL strike|strike-shortened]] 4\u201311 campaign.\n\n====1988====\n{{details|1988 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nThe spring was marked by several notable trades as the club jockeyed to improve on its 4\u201311 finish in 1987. Todd Blackledge was traded to Pittsburgh on March 29 and 12-year veteran quarterback [[Steve DeBerg]] was acquired from Tampa Bay on March 31. The Chiefs moved up one spot in the first round of the draft to select defensive end [[Neil Smith (football player)|Neil Smith]] with the third overall pick. Bill Kenney opened the team's initial two games at quarterback, but was replaced by DeBerg for the second half against Seattle.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> DeBerg guided the team to a 20\u201313 win against [[1988 Denver Broncos season|Denver]] in his initial start as a member of the Chiefs. However, six losses and a tie followed as Kenney and DeBerg jostled for the QB job.\n\nAs the season drew to a close, it became apparent the winds of change were blowing across the organization. President Jack Steadman resigned on December 8, while general manager Jim Schaaf was relieved of his duties the same day.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> Steadman was later named chairman of the board. On the field, the Chiefs finished the year at 4\u201311\u20131 as questions swirled regarding Gansz's future and who would fill the club's leadership void. One day after the season's conclusion, former [[Philadelphia Eagles]] and USFL executive [[Carl Peterson]] was named the club's president/general manager and chief operating officer on December 19.\n\n==A change of face==\n\n===\"Martyball\", 1989\u20132000===\n{{Further|1989 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\nAfter compiling an 8\u201322\u20131 record in two seasons, Frank Gansz was relieved of his duties as head coach on January 5, 1989. General manager Carl Peterson's selection as Gansz's successor would be former Cleveland Browns head coach [[Marty Schottenheimer]], who was named the seventh head coach in Chiefs history on January 24. The first draft choice of the Peterson era set the tone for the next decade as the club selected linebacker [[Derrick Thomas]] with the fourth overall selection. Thomas paired with defensive end Neil Smith to form one of the most feared pass-rushing duos in NFL history, compiling a combined 212.5 sacks during their illustrious Chiefs careers. The Peterson-Schottenheimer era got off to an inauspicious start in a 34\u201320 loss at Denver on September 10 as quarterback Steve DeBerg's first pass attempt was intercepted and returned for a TD.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/> The club won just four times in its next 10 games as former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback [[Ron Jaworski]] and [[Steve Pelluer]], who was acquired in a trade from Dallas, each opened three games apiece during that span. DeBerg regained the starting job for the final five weeks of the season, generating four wins that put the Chiefs just out of post-season qualification at 8\u20137\u20131. A 34\u20130 shutout win against Houston highlighted the club's stretch run. Running back Christian Okoye became the first Chief to lead the NFL in rushing with 1,480 yards, while Derrick Thomas won consensus NFL Rookie of the Year honors.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1980's\"/>\n\n====1990====\n{{Further|1990 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nThe foundation for the club's formidable offensive line of the 1990s gathered two key ingredients when center [[Tim Grunhard]] and guard [[Dave Szott]] were acquired in the [[1990 NFL Draft]]. Construction began on the club's indoor practice facility at the Truman Sports Complex, giving the Chiefs an 80-yard indoor field and weight room facilities upon its completion. Former defensive tackle Buck Buchanan was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on August 4. In the pre-season, The Chiefs made their initial overseas appearance, losing a 19\u20133 [[American Bowl]] decision against the [[1990 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]] at [[Olympic Stadium (Berlin)|Olympic Stadium]] in Berlin, Germany. Schottenheimer's club got out of the starting gate quickly, winning three of their first four games.

Kansas City led the NFL with a franchise-record 60.0 sacks, including a team-record 20.0 by Derrick Thomas. Thomas established an NFL single-game record with 7.0 sacks in an inspiring [[Veterans Day]] performance against [[1990 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle]], a game the Seahawks miraculously won, 17\u201316, on a last-second, 25-yard TD pass to wide receiver [[Paul Skansi]]. That loss brought on the furious stretch run which saw the club record victories in six of its last seven outings. Behind DeBerg's offensive leadership (23 TD passes with just four interceptions) Kansas City finished the year with a franchise-best +26 turnover differential. The Chiefs clinched their first post-season berth since 1986 with a 24\u201321 win at San Diego and finished the year at 11\u20135, marking the franchise's best finish since 1969. The Chiefs suffered a heart-breaking, 17\u201316 loss at Miami on January 5, 1991, in an AFC Wild Card Game as placekicker Nick Lowery's potential game-winning 52-yard field goal fell short with 0:56 remaining.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\n====1991====\n{{Further|1991 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nOn July 27, former placekicker Jan Stenerud became the first of his position to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

The club finished the regular season at 10\u20136, marking the first time since 1968\u201369 that the franchise had qualified for the playoffs in consecutive seasons. A 27\u201321 victory against the [[1991 Los Angeles Raiders season|Los Angeles Raiders]] in the regular season finale gave the Chiefs the right to host the Raiders just six days later in the inaugural post-season game in Arrowhead's history, and the Chiefs' first home playoff game in 20 years. Thanks to six Los Angeles turnovers, the Chiefs registered their first post-season victory since Super Bowl IV with a 10\u20136 win in an AFC Wild Card Game on December 28.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/> The following week, the Chiefs lost a 37\u201314 decision at Buffalo on January 5, 1992, in an AFC Divisional Playoff match-up as the Buffalo Bills' dynamic offense proved to be too much for the Chiefs.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\n====1992====\n{{Further|1992 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nA longtime nemesis with Seattle, \"Plan B\" free agent quarterback [[Dave Krieg]] was signed as the club's starter on March 19. A melancholy off-season awaited the Chiefs, who mourned the passing of Player Personnel Director Whitey Dovell on May 22 and Hall of Fame defensive tackle Buck Buchanan on July 16. Both Dovell and Buchanan lost courageous battles with cancer. Six-time Pro Bowl safety Deron Cherry announced his retirement in July after registering 50 interceptions in 11 seasons with the franchise. The Chiefs retired the jerseys of former players Buck Buchanan (#86), Willie Lanier (#63) and Jan Stenerud (#3) in a ceremony prior to a pre-season contest against Buffalo.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\nFirst-round draft pick, cornerback [[Dale Carter]] won the Bert Bell Trophy as the NFL's Rookie of the Year. The very first time Carter touched the ball in an NFL contest, he registered a 46-yard punt return touchdown in a 24\u201310 win at [[1992 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego]] on September 6. Running back Christian Okoye surpassed Ed Podolak as the all-time leading rusher in team history against [[1992 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle]] on September 13. Injuries eventually made the 1992 campaign Okoye's last with the Chiefs after he compiled 4,897 rushing yards with the franchise. The club got off to a 3\u20131 start, but was faced with a 4\u20134 record at the season's midpoint. Despite four consecutive victories, the club's post-season hopes still came down to the season's final contest. Owning a 9\u20136 record and needing one more victory to secure a playoff berth, the Chiefs defense tallied three touchdowns, while Dave Krieg tossed a pair of scoring passes as Kansas City claimed a 42\u201320 win against Denver to finish the season at 10\u20136. Despite the big win against [[1992 Denver Broncos season|Denver]], the Chiefs made a quick exit from the playoffs as Krieg was sacked 7 times in a 17\u20130 AFC Wild Card loss at [[1992 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego]] on January 2, 1993.\n\n====1993====\n{{Further|1993 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nThe Chiefs spent the off-season installing the \"[[West Coast offense]]\" under the direction of new offensive coordinator [[Paul Hackett (American football)|Paul Hackett]], who at one time served as quarterbacks coach to [[Joe Montana]] in San Francisco. On April 20, the Chiefs traded for Joe Montana, who directed the 49ers to four Super Bowl victories in the previous decade. Guard [[Will Shields]] was selected with the club's third-round draft choice, rounding out the \"law firm\" of Grunhard, Szott and Shields which anchored the interior of Chiefs offensive line for most of the decade.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\nOn June 9, the club signed unrestricted free agent running back [[Marcus Allen]], who had spent 11 seasons tormenting the Chiefs as a member of the rival Los Angeles Raiders. Montana and Allen made their debuts in a 27\u20133 win at [[1993 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay]] on September 5, marking Montana's first Opening Day appearance since 1990. Shields initiated a franchise-record streak of 175 consecutive starts the following week at [[1993 Houston Oilers season|Houston]]. Thanks to a pair of ''Monday Night Football'' wins at Arrowhead, the club owned a 6\u20132 mid-season record. Before taking the field in a Sunday night contest at [[1993 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]] on December 26, the team learned it had clinched its first AFC West title since 1971 thanks to a [[1993 Oakland Raiders season|Raiders]] loss earlier in the day. The team finished the season with an 11\u20135 regular season record, marking the club's fourth consecutive year with a double-digit victory tally. Linebacker Derrick Thomas was named the NFL's Man of the Year following the season. Thomas, who founded \"The Third and Long Foundation\", received the honor in large part due to his efforts in promoting children's literacy.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\nKansas City got its first true taste of \"Montana Magic\" as the Hall of Fame passer engineered a brilliant comeback in a 27\u201324 OT win in an AFC Wild Card thriller against [[1993 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh]] on January 8, 1994. Next, the Chiefs traveled to the [[Astrodome]] to face the red-hot Oilers, who had won 11 straight games to conclude the regular season. The heavily favored Oilers opened up a 13\u20137 lead in the fourth quarter, but once again, Montana conjured a comeback, guiding the club to a 28\u201320 victory. The Chiefs playoff journey ended as the club made its initial [[AFC Championship Game]] appearance at Buffalo on January 23. Montana was knocked out of the contest early in the second half as Buffalo claimed its record fourth straight AFC title by a score of 30\u201313.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\n====1994====\n{{Further|1994 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nWhile the previous off-season saw the Chiefs stockpile several key free agents, a number of familiar faces departed following the 1993 season, most notably cornerbacks Albert Lewis and Kevin Ross, as well as placekicker Nick Lowery. Quarterback [[Steve Bono]] was acquired in a trade with San Francisco on May 2 to serve as Joe Montana's backup, a job he previously held when both were with the 49ers. A grass playing field was installed at Arrowhead Stadium, replacing the previous [[AstroTurf]] surface. The club made its second American Bowl appearance in the pre-season, meeting [[1994 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota]] in [[Tokyo, Japan]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\nOn September 11, [[Steve Young (American football)|Steve Young]] and the [[1994 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] came to Arrowhead to play against Joe Montana and the Chiefs in a highly anticipated matchup. The Chiefs prevailed over the 49ers and Montana's successor by a 24\u201317 count before a crowd of 79,907, the second-largest \"in-house\" attendance in Arrowhead history.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/> After starting the season 3\u20130, the Chiefs dropped back-to-back games before snapping an 11-game losing streak against [[1994 Denver Broncos season|Denver]] at Mile High Stadium on October 17 in a memorable Monday night contest. Montana orchestrated a masterful comeback, connecting with WR Willie Davis for a five-yard TD with 0:08 remaining to give the Chiefs a 31\u201328 triumph. A late-season, three-game losing skid put the club's playoff hopes in jeopardy. The Chiefs found themselves at 8\u20137 faced with a do-or-die regular season finale against the [[1994 Los Angeles Raiders season|Raiders]] in the final NFL contest (to date) played at the [[Los Angeles Coliseum]] and in Los Angeles until 2016.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/> Marcus Allen had his finest game as a Chief, ironically against his former team, rushing 33 times for 132 yards en route to a 19\u20139 win. At 9\u20137, Kansas City qualified for the playoffs for a fifth straight season. However, the Chiefs made a rapid departure from the playoffs in Montana's final professional contest at Miami on [[New Year's Eve]]. Montana and Dolphins' quarterback Dan Marino conducted a masterful first-half duel that ended deadlocked at 17\u201317, but [[1994 Miami Dolphins season|Miami]] eventually prevailed by a 27\u201317 count.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\n====1995====\n{{Further|1995 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nJoe Montana announced his retirement from football after 16 years in the NFL on April 18 and Steve Bono was promoted to the starting job.

The Chiefs led the NFL in rushing offense (138.9 ypg), scoring defense (15.1 ppg) and turnover ratio (+12). A 24\u20133 win at Arizona on October 1 featured a surreal, 76-yard TD run on a bootleg by Bono as the Chiefs initiated a seven-game winning streak, the franchise's longest since 1969. In a ''Monday Night Football'' classic against [[1995 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego]] on October 9, wide receiver [[Tamarick Vanover]] returned a punt for an 86-yard TD to provide the winning points in a 29\u201323 victory, the team's third straight home win in overtime.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\nThe club's defense began to flex its muscle, beginning with a 21\u20137 win at Denver on October 22. The contest, played in a Rocky Mountain snowstorm, featured the 100th rushing TD of Marcus Allen's career. The Chiefs won a home game for the third time on a last-second return score that concluded in Arrowhead's west end zone when cornerback [[Mark Collins (American football)|Mark Collins]] scooped up a fumble for a 20\u201313 win against [[1995 Houston Oilers season|Houston]]. Kansas City clinched a division title with a 29\u201323 victory at [[1995 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland]] on December 3 en route to a franchise-best 13\u20133 regular season record and a team-record sixth consecutive postseason berth. The Chiefs were represented by seven players in the Pro Bowl, more than any other AFC team.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/> In the playoffs, the Chiefs dropped an AFC Divisional Playoff Game against the underdog [[1995 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] on January 7\u2014a blustery afternoon with the temperature at 11 degrees and a wind chill of \u22129. Three interceptions and three missed field goals from placekicker [[Lin Elliot]] contributed to the 10\u20137 loss at Arrowhead.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\n====1996====\n{{Further|1996 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nKansas City entered the 1996 campaign with essentially the same lineup as the club boasted in 1995 and were featured on the cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' along with Green Bay as pre-season Super Bowl favorites. Kansas City made its third American Bowl appearance, this time against [[1996 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas]] in [[Monterrey, Mexico]]. The club started the season with a 4\u20130 record for the first time in team history, but the season's lofty expectations came crashing down as the squad lost three of its next four games. A three-game winning streak, including a victory over the eventual [[Super Bowl XXXI|Super Bowl champion]] [[1996 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]], put the club back in post-season contention at 8\u20133.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\nThat rosy picture quickly crumbled in a 28\u201314 loss against San Diego on November 24 as Steve Bono was relieved in the second half by back-up quarterback [[Rich Gannon]]. Gannon assumed the starting reins for a 28\u201324 win in a Thanksgiving Day game at [[1996 Detroit Lions season|Detroit]] as Marcus Allen registered his 111th career rushing TD to surpass [[Walter Payton]] as the NFL's all-time leader in that department, a mark that was later broken by [[Emmitt Smith]]. Needing just one more win to qualify for the playoffs, the Chiefs dropped their next two games as an injury-hampered Gannon was sidelined for good in the second quarter of a 24\u201319 loss against [[1996 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis]]. Faced with a must-win situation in a frigid regular season finale at Buffalo, the club's post-season hopes hinged on Bono. Despite a 20\u20139 loss to the [[1996 Buffalo Bills season|Bills]], the Chiefs still had a shot to slip into the playoffs if Atlanta could secure a win at Jacksonville. However, Atlanta placekicker [[Morten Andersen]]'s 30-yard field goal attempt went wide left with 0:04 remaining, preserving a 19\u201317 win and the AFC's final Wild Card spot for the [[1996 Jacksonville Jaguars season|Jaguars]], who won a tiebreaker with Kansas City. The Chiefs finished with a 9\u20137 record, missing the postseason for the first time since 1989.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\n====1997====\n{{Further|1997 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nKansas City dramatically retooled its roster in 1997, beginning with the signing of free agent quarterback Elvis Grbac on March 17. In addition to Grbac, the Chiefs lineup featured 11 new starters, including wide receiver [[Andre Rison]], who won team MVP honors after becoming the club's first Pro Bowl receiver in a decade. On defense, the club's top four picks from the 1996 Draft, safeties [[Jerome Woods]] and [[Reggie Tongue]], defensive end [[John Browning (American football)|John Browning]] and linebacker [[Donnie Edwards]], all emerged as starters.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\nTackle [[John Alt]] announced his retirement at training camp in River Falls, Wisconsin on July 21. All the new faces quickly formed a cohesive unit as the Chiefs posted a 13\u20133 record, an 8\u20130 Arrowhead record and their second AFC West title in three years. The club engineered several dramatic finishes, the first of which came in a ''Monday Night Football'' thriller at Oakland on September 8 when Elvis Grbac connected with Andre Rison on an improbable 32-yard TD pass with just 0:03 remaining to cap a 28\u201327 win. Six days later, Kansas City's defense produced a remarkable goal-line stand to preserve a 22\u201316 victory at Arrowhead vs. [[1997 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo]].<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/> After posting a 6\u20132 record during the season's first half, Kansas City's good fortune appeared to run out against Pittsburgh when Grbac suffered a broken clavicle. However, Rich Gannon led the team to a 5\u20131 mark in their next six outings.<ref name=\"Chiefs History 1990's\"/>\n\nPlacekicker [[Pete Stoyanovich]] provided one of the year's most memorable moments, connecting on a line-drive 54-yard field as time expired to give Kansas City a 24\u201322 win against Denver on November 16. [[1997 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco]] entered Arrowhead boasting an 11-game winning streak, the team departed after suffering a 44\u20139 defeat. The Chiefs' vaunted defensive unit pitched a 30\u20130 shutout vs. Oakland on December 7. The Chiefs led the NFL in scoring defense, allowing a mere 14.5 points per game. The 232 total points permitted by the Chiefs in 1997 were the lowest tally ever allowed in a 16-game season in team history. Kansas City also broke a 63-year-old mark owned by the [[1934 NFL season|1934]] [[1934 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]] by not permitting a second-half TD in 10 consecutive games. Grbac returned for the regular season finale against [[1997 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans]] on December 21 as the squad finished the year with six consecutive victories, a first in team history.\n\nThe Chiefs' 13\u20133 record gave them home field advantage throughout the AFC Playoffs. However, their playoff run was short-lived, as Kansas City lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos 14\u201310 in the Divisional round.\n\n====1998====\n{{details|1998 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nThe following year, with Elvis Grbac back at the helm, the Chiefs fell to 7\u20139 in [[1998 NFL season|1998]]. Marty Schottenheimer took much of the blame for his failed attempts in the playoffs and conservative style of coaching (\"[[Martyball]]\"), and resigned following the 1998 season.\n\n====1999====\n{{details|topic=1999 Kansas City Chiefs season|1999 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\nSchottenheimer left as head coach, replaced by his defensive coach [[Gunther Cunningham]]. In two years, Cunningham showed little improvement, going 9\u20137 and 7\u20139. After the loss of [[Derrick Thomas]], the collapse of the defense was unmistakable. The Chiefs' wins were mostly made by a high scoring offense rather than a powerful defense.\n\n==The Chiefs in the 21st century==\n\n===An explosive offense, 2001\u20132005===\n\n====2001====\n{{details|topic=2001 Kansas City Chiefs season|2001 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nAfter coaching the [[1999 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Rams]] to the [[Super Bowl]] and retiring, [[Dick Vermeil]] was lured out of retirement and took over as head coach in [[2001 NFL season|2001]]. It was noted that Vermeil would have the team ready for the Super Bowl \"within three years\", while in fact Vermeil would stay in Kansas City for the next five.\n\nThe first move the team made was forced after quarterback Elvis Grbac voided his contract, forgoing an $11 million bonus, leaving to lead the [[Super Bowl XXXV|Super Bowl champion]] [[2000 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]]. Vermeil replaced him with his primary pick for the Rams' quarterback, [[Trent Green]].\n\nAnother notable replacement was [[Priest Holmes]] at running back, who had served as back-up to Baltimore's [[Jamal Lewis]] in their Super Bowl season. Additions to the offensive line, including left tackle [[Willie Roaf]] from New Orleans, [[Casey Wiegmann]] at center, Brian Waters at guard, and [[John Welbourn]] from Philadelphia helped create the Chiefs' high powered offense. Holmes would go on to break [[Marshall Faulk]]'s record of 26 touchdowns in a season on December 27, 2003.\n\nVermeil brought many elements of \"[[The Greatest Show on Turf]]\" from St. Louis to Kansas City's own offense, but much like the Schottenheimer era in the 1990s, the offense didn't win any playoff games.\n\n====2003====\n{{Main|2003 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nThe Chiefs went 13\u20133 in [[2003 NFL season|2003]] and their offense, considered by many as one of the most powerful of all time, helped make Kansas City again a favorite to win [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]]. After starting 9\u20130, the Chiefs lost to the [[2003 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]] in their tenth game following a \"guarantee\" by Bengals wide receiver [[Chad Ochocinco|Chad Johnson]]. The Chiefs' dream season of 2003 began to lose momentum by November, but they still managed to gain the number two seed in the [[2003\u201304 NFL playoffs|2004 playoffs]]. The mighty homefield advantage of Arrowhead Stadium and their high-powered offense wouldn't lead the Chiefs to glory and the Chiefs lost to the [[2003 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] in the AFC Divisional playoffs in an offensive shootout in which neither team punted, an NFL playoffs first. The Chiefs' defense came under fire immediately after the loss, and [[Greg Robinson (American football coach)|Greg Robinson]], the team's defensive coordinator, resigned after the season.\n\n====2004====\n{{Main|2004 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nAs with the loss to the Broncos in 1997, this loss led to a poor following season. The Chiefs managed to finish the [[2004 NFL season|2004 season]] with a 7\u20139 record. In 2004, Gunther Cunningham was brought back as the defensive coordinator. However, the defense showed little improvement. The offense, unable to record the same high scores as the previous year, was unable to bring in the wins as they had the previous year.\n\n[[File:Larry_Johnson_Chiefs.jpg|thumb|left|Running back [[Larry Johnson (running back)|Larry Johnson]]]]\n====2005====\n{{Main|2005 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nFor their 2005 campaign, the Chiefs brought in several new players to boost a defense that had finished among the worst units the past three years. The year also saw [[Larry Johnson (running back)|Larry Johnson]] start at running back in place of an injured [[Priest Holmes]]. But despite winning ten games, the Chiefs became just the fourth team in NFL history to go 10\u20136 and not reach the playoffs.\n\n===Rebuilding a contender, 2006\u20132012===\n\n====2006====\n{{Main|2006 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nA tearful head coach [[Dick Vermeil]] announced his retirement before the final game of the [[2005 Kansas City Chiefs season|2005 season]]. Within two weeks, then-[[New York Jets]] head coach [[Herman Edwards]] had signed a new 4-year contract to coach the Chiefs. The 2006 Chiefs returned to the playoffs for the first time in three seasons, only to lose 23\u20138 in the Wild Card round against their playoff nemesis, the [[2006 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]].\n\nMeanwhile, Chiefs owner and founder [[Lamar Hunt]] died on December 13, 2006, due to complications brought on by a ten-year battle with [[prostate cancer]]. Hunt was remembered throughout the remainder of the [[2006 NFL season|2006 season]] all throughout the NFL with moments of silence and ceremonies in Kansas City. Hunt's four children inherited ownership of the Chiefs. His oldest son, [[Clark Hunt|Clark]], became chairman and CEO of the Chiefs, and the public face of the ownership group. He represents the Chiefs at owner meetings, and has the final say in team operations.\n[[File:Tony_Gonzalez_at_2005_Pro_Bowl_050213-N-3019M-002.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Tight end [[Tony Gonzalez]] in 2005]]\n====2007====\n{{Main|2007 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nThe Chiefs' 2007 off-season began with turmoil over the contract of [[Tony Gonzalez]], and the long-term career of [[Trent Green]] in Kansas City. Backup quarterback [[Damon Huard]] was signed to a three-year contract in February and Green was not only asked to restructure his contract but offered in trades to other teams.\n\nOn June 5, the Chiefs agreed to trade Green to the [[Miami Dolphins]] for a conditional fifth round pick in the [[2008 NFL Draft]], pending a physical from Green.<ref name=\"Green goes to Dolphins\">Pasquarelli, Len.

Five different running backs were used after [[Larry Johnson (running back)|Larry Johnson]] was injured in week 9 against [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay]]. The team also had no stability at quarterback with Huard and [[Brodie Croyle]], while their offensive line depleted in the absence of their former Pro Bowl guard [[Will Shields]].\n\nThe season ended with a nine-game losing streak, the team's first since [[1987 Kansas City Chiefs season|1987]], and a 4\u201312 record. It was the Chiefs' first season with 12 losses since [[1978 Kansas City Chiefs season|1978]].\n\nHead coach Herman Edwards continued to build upon the Chiefs' roster with young players, mostly on defense, and attempted stabilize a once record-setting offensive line.<ref name=\"Transition\"/> The Chiefs continue to rebuild a defense that may quietly creep its way back to respectability.<ref name=\"Transition\">Teicher, Adam.

Other than that, there was little else of note about the season, which saw Kansas City fall to a franchise-worst 2\u201314 record.\n\nDuring the next offseason, the team made news by acquiring quarterback [[Matt Cassel]] (who had filled in for Brady during the previous year) and veteran linebacker [[Mike Vrabel]] from New England for a second-round draft pick, which was used to obtain LSU defensive end [[Tyson Jackson]]. The Chiefs were also awarded the 256th and last player in the draft for the first time since 1970, South Carolina kicker [[Ryan Succop]]. Also, [[Scott Pioli]] was hired as general manager, yet another acquisition from New England.\n\nThere was little apparent sign of improvement as the Chiefs began 2009 by losing five games in a row before a victory over the Washington Redskins in Week 6. However, the team did manage to inflict an overtime defeat on the defending Super Bowl Champion Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 11, and closed out the year with a 4\u201312 record by overpowering Denver and preventing the Broncos from going to the playoffs. In that game, second-year running back [[Jamaal Charles]] set a franchise record by rushing for 259 yards.\n\nThe Chiefs got off to a 3\u20130 start in 2010, first by beating San Diego 21\u201314 on ''Monday Night Football''. This was their first MNF win in a decade, in addition to their first home win over the Chargers since 2006. They followed up the next week with a 16\u201314 win in Cleveland, followed by a 31\u201310 thrashing of the San Francisco 49ers at home. The Chiefs entered their bye week as the only remaining undefeated team, but as most experts predicted, fell to Indianapolis 19\u20139 in Week 5. They lost a close game with the Houston Texans (35\u201331) in Week 6, beat Jacksonville in Week 7, and then won a razor-thin game against the winless Buffalo Bills. After going into overtime with a 10\u201310 score, neither team was able to score anything until Ryan Succop kicked a 35-yard field goal just as the clock reached 0:00 and avoiding a tie. Then came losses to Oakland and Denver, three straight wins over Seattle, Arizona, and Denver, a loss in San Diego, and wins over St. Louis and Tennessee. Losing the final game at home versus Oakland, the Chiefs finished 10\u20136 and won their first division title since 2003. However, the team's lack of postseason experience showed up as they were buried 30\u20137 by the Baltimore Ravens in the wild card round of the playoffs.\n\nKansas City began 2011 by losing its first three games, including blowout losses at home against Buffalo and at Detroit, where the Chiefs lost Jamaal Charles for the remainder of the season due to a torn ACL. However, the Chiefs were able to rebound from the slow start, winning their next four contests, including a thrilling overtime victory over San Diego on ''Monday Night Football''. Unfortunately, the Chiefs would lose all momentum the following week when they were stunned at Arrowhead by the winless Miami Dolphins, losing quarterback Matt Cassel for the season with a hand injury. After losing four of the next five, the Chiefs fired head coach Todd Haley less than one year removed from a division title. With interim head coach [[Romeo Crennel]] and recently acquired quarterback [[Kyle Orton]] at the helm, the Chiefs were able to knock off then-undefeated Green Bay, and at 6\u20138, still had a shot at the division crown. The Chiefs would fall just short, however, losing 16\u201313 in overtime to arch-rival Oakland. The Chiefs would finish the 2011 season with a road win versus eventual AFC West champion Denver, finishing the season at 7\u20139.\n\nThe Chiefs hit rock bottom in 2012, with a passing game that was one of the worst of all time. Cassel was benched twice in favor of [[Brady Quinn]], but neither quarterback could perform well enough to win more than one game each. Despite having a roster that produced five Pro Bowlers and a 1,500-yard rushing season from Charles, the Chiefs stumbled to a 1\u20139 record.\n\nKansas City's 2012 season took a tragic and bizarre turn on December 1 when linebacker [[Jovan Belcher]] murdered his girlfriend in an argument. He then drove to Arrowhead Stadium, where he got into a confrontation with Crennel and several other Chiefs employees in the parking lot. They attempted to calm him down, after which Belcher thanked them and immediately shot himself dead.\n\nWith the team scheduled to play against Carolina the next day, there was considerable controversy as to whether the game should go on, but in the end it was decided not to move or cancel it. In a half-empty stadium, the Chiefs won the emotional match 27\u201321.\n\nAfter the Chiefs' victory over Carolina, the team did not win again in the 2012 season, only averaging 5.75 points per game in their final four games,<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/kan/2012.htm</ref> and finished the season on a four-game losing streak and with a 2\u201314 record on the season.\n\nFollowing the 2012 season, both head coach Romeo Crennel and general manager [[Scott Pioli]] were fired from their positions. On January 4, the Chiefs signed former [[Philadelphia Eagles]] head coach [[Andy Reid]], who had been fired after coaching the Eagles for the past fourteen years, and on January 13 of the same year the Chiefs hired [[John Dorsey (American football)|John Dorsey]] to be their general manager.\n\n===The Andy Reid era, 2013\u2013present===\n\n====2013====\n\n{{details|2013 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs, due to their 2\u201314 record in the season prior, received the #1 pick in the [[2013 NFL Draft]], which was the first time in franchise history that team had the #1 pick in the NFL Draft that was not acquired in a transaction. However, about eight weeks prior to their first selection in the 2013 NFL Draft, the Chiefs traded for quarterback [[Alex Smith]], who the year prior had been benched in favor of [[Colin Kaepernick]] on the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. The Chiefs were able to acquire Smith by trading their second round picks in 2013 and 2014. While this move did end up bringing the quarterback for the Chiefs for the next five years to Kansas City, the selection was only supported by a plurality of Chiefs fans<ref>http://www.arrowheadpride.com/2013/2/27/4036414/alex-smith-trade-approval-poll-chiefs-trade-49ers</ref> at the time of the trade. After an offseason that brought players such as [[Sean Smith (cornerback)|Sean Smith]] and [[Geoff Schwartz]], the Chiefs selected [[Eric Fisher (American football)|Eric Fisher]] with the first pick in the 2013 NFL Draft, as well as selecting future four time Pro Bowler [[Travis Kelce]] in the third round of the same draft. In the 2013 season, the Chiefs started the season with an incredible start, tying the 2003 team as the best start in franchise history and being the last team undefeated in the 2013 season, starting out with a 9\u20130 record. However, due a more difficult second half of the Chiefs schedule and somewhat of a regression by the Chiefs defense, the team faltered down the stretch, going 2\u20135 in their final seven games.\n\nEven though the team struggled near the end of the season, the Chiefs still clinched a playoff berth as a wildcard and played the [[Indianapolis Colts]] in the first round of the [[2013\u201314 NFL playoffs]]. It seemed that the Chiefs would be able to win their first playoff game in twenty years and go on to the Divisional Round, but even though the Chiefs took a 38\u201310 lead in the early portion of the third quarter, the Chiefs were unable to contain the Colts offense and lost the game by only one point, 45\u201344.<ref>https://www.arrowheadpride.com/2014/1/4/5274372/chiefs-colts-final-score-kc-blows-28-point-lead-lose-in-wild-card</ref>\n\n[[File:Eric_Berry.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Safety [[Eric Berry]] was an integral part of the Chiefs defense in the 2010s]]\n====2014====\n\n{{details|2014 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nEntering the 2014 season, the Chiefs had the twenty-second pick in the [[2014 NFL Draft]], and selected linebacker [[Dee Ford]] out of Alabama, as well as future starting right guard [[Laurent Duvernay-Tardif]] with the 200th pick of the same draft.\n\nUnlike the 2013 season, the Chiefs were unable to get out to a good start on the year, as the Chiefs lost their first two and three out of their first five games. However, after a bye week in week 6, the Chiefs went on a tear, as they won their next five games, dominating the St. Louis Rams and the New York Jets, as well as beating the eventual Super Bowl participant Seattle Seahawks to put the team at a 7\u20133 record after ten games.\n\nHowever, disaster struck as the team suffered a devastating loss to the winless 0\u201310 [[Oakland Raiders]], who were able to upset the Chiefs on [[Thursday Night Football]]. This led to a three-game losing streak, which put the Chiefs at 7\u20136 on the season and desperately needing to win out for a chance to play in the [[2014\u201315 NFL playoffs|NFL playoffs]]. This did not occur, as the Chiefs lost to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in Week 16 and eventually missed the playoffs with a 9\u20137 record.\n\nOne bright spot was LB [[Justin Houston]], who set a franchise record with 22.0 sacks, only 0.5 sacks short of the NFL record set by [[Michael Strahan]].\n\n====2015====\n\n{{details|2015 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nEntering the 2015 season, the Chiefs had the eighteenth pick in the [[2015 NFL Draft]], and selected cornerback [[Marcus Peters]] out of Washington, who would become the eventual Defensive Rookie of the Year and a two time Pro Bowler for the Kansas City Chiefs. In the same draft, the Chiefs also selected future starters such as [[Mitch Morse]], [[Chris Conley (American football)|Chris Conley]], and [[Steven Nelson]].\n\nWhile the Chiefs were able to win their first game against the [[Houston Texans]] and in their second game of the season, they held a 24\u201317 lead with only two minutes to play against the [[Denver Broncos]], who had won the past four [[AFC West]] championships, the Chiefs allowed a touchdown and then fumbled with less than thirty seconds remaining, sealing a victory for the Broncos. This loss was the first of five consecutive losses, and the team seemed to be spiraling out of control with a record of 1\u20135.\n\nThankfully for the Chiefs, the team overall began to play better and began an extremely improbable eleven game winning streak, beating the eventual Super Bowl Champion Denver Broncos in their third game of the streak, and this streak was able to give the Chiefs the push they needed to make the [[2015\u201316 NFL playoffs]], as they clinched in Week 16, and even had a chance to win the AFC West in Week 17 if the Broncos lost and the Chiefs won. While the Chiefs were able to beat the [[Oakland Raiders]] and uphold their end of the scenario, the [[San Diego Chargers]] fell short and were unable to beat the Denver Broncos, and the Broncos clinched the division and home-field throughout the AFC Playoffs.\n\nIn the Chiefs first game of the postseason, they matched up against the 9\u20137 Houston Texans, and after a 22-year drought, the Chiefs were finally able to win a playoff game as the Chiefs walloped the Texans 30\u20130. This victory was the first time the Chiefs had won a playoff game since 1993, and gave the Chiefs the chance to make the AFC Championship Game for only the second time in team history, if they could beat the [[New England Patriots]] on the road. The Chiefs were unable to beat the Patriots, as injuries and losing the turnover battle sealed the loss for the Chiefs, and they were unable to beat the Patriots and lost 27\u201320 in the divisional round.\n \nOne notable achievement during this season was the first award given to the Chiefs in the Andy Reid era, as Marcus Peters won the Defensive Rookie of the Year award, and Eric Berry also won the Comeback Player of the Year award after beating his battle with cancer and playing well with the Chiefs in his first year after his treatment.\n\n====2016====\n\n{{details|2016 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nIn the [[2016 NFL Draft]], the Chiefs traded back out of the first round and instead drafted with the 37th pick in the draft, and used this selection to draft [[Chris Jones (defensive tackle, born 1994)|Chris Jones]]. As well as drafting Chris Jones, the Chiefs selected eventual three-time Pro Bowler [[Tyreek Hill]] in the fifth round of the same draft.\n\nThe Chiefs start to the season was no more than mediocre, and the before their bye week the Chiefs were destroyed by the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] 43\u201314, which put the Chiefs on 2\u20132 for the year. After the bye week, however, the Chiefs won their next five games and were sitting at 7\u20132 on the season until an upset occurred as the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] were able to eek out a two-point victory against the Chiefs at [[Arrowhead Stadium]], as the Bucs won 19\u201317. The Chiefs experienced an almost identical game against another team that missed the postseason, losing 19\u201317 to the [[Tennessee Titans]] at home. This loss put the Chiefs at 10\u20134 and the dream of a division title was in jeopardy. Heading into Week 17, the Chiefs were 11\u20134 and their rival, the [[Oakland Raiders]], were 12\u20133 but the Raiders did not have the tiebreaker on the Chiefs. In order for the Chiefs to clinch the division, similar to the 2015 season, the Chiefs needed a win and the division leader to lose. Unlike 2015, however, the division leader lost as the Oakland Raiders were unable to start their quarterback, [[Derek Carr]] due to an injury and the Raiders lost to the Broncos. The Chiefs were able to pick up a crucial victory over the [[San Diego Chargers]] (which would also be their final game in San Diego) and clinch the division and a first-round bye.\n\nHeading into the [[2016-17 NFL playoffs]], the Chiefs were 12\u20134 and claimed the second seed in the AFC. After the Pittsburgh Steelers were able to defeat the [[Miami Dolphins]] in the Wildcard Round, it was confirmed that the Chiefs would have to play the same team that beat them by 29 points fifteen weeks prior. While the Chiefs were able to hold Pittsburgh from scoring any touchdowns in their divisional round game, the Chiefs were only able to put up sixteen points of offense and the Steelers' six field goals were enough to put the Steelers into the AFC Championship Game and once again give a devastating playoff loss to the franchise.\n\n====2017====\n\n{{details|2017 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nIn the [[2017 NFL Draft]], the Chiefs decided to trade up into the draft, giving up their first round selections in 2017 and 2018 as well as their third round pick in 2017 in order to move up to #10 in the draft. With this selection, the Chiefs selected [[Patrick Mahomes]], their first quarterback drafted in the first round since 1983. While Mahomes would only start one game in the 2017 season, he was pegged to become the future of the franchise as the Chiefs had to trade a significant amount of draft capital in order to secure the quarterback. As well, during the offseason [[John Dorsey (American football)|John Dorsey]] was fired and [[Brett Veach]] was promoted to become the Chiefs next general manager.\n\nThe Chiefs were able to start the season strong, and after five games the Chiefs were 5\u20130 on the season. However, the Chiefs were unable to keep the winning streak alive and instead started a streak in the other direction, losing six of seven and four in a row. This put the Chiefs at 6\u20136 on the season and they desperately needed a win against the [[Los Angeles Chargers]] to put themselves in a good position to win back to back AFC West titles. The Chiefs were able to beat the Chargers and move to 7\u20136. The Chiefs were able to win their next two games and clinch the [[AFC West]] in Week 16, which was the first time in team history that they had won consecutive division titles. With the Chiefs being locked into the #4 seed in the AFC, the Chiefs rested most of their starters and Patrick Mahomes started his first game of his career. While his numbers were not incredibly impressive, he showed raw talent with several impressive throws. He was also able to win this game, and the Chiefs finished the year at 10\u20136 and with the #4 seed in the AFC.\n\nIn the [[2017\u201318 NFL playoffs]], the Chiefs were matched up with the 9\u20137 [[Tennessee Titans]], led by [[Marcus Mariota]]. The Chiefs were able to get out to an early 21\u20133 lead, but the offense and defense faltered down the stretch and the Chiefs lost another close playoff game as the final score was 22\u201321 Titans. One bright spot for the team was rookie sensation [[Kareem Hunt]], who led the NFL in rushing yards and was selected to the Pro Bowl as well as being named Co-Offensive Rookie of the Year, along with [[Alvin Kamara]].\n\n[[File:Patrick Mahomes II.JPG|right|thumb|Patrick Mahomes, the Chiefs starting quarterback since 2018, has broken numerous passing records and garnered an MVP award]]\n====2018====\n\n{{details|2018 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\n\nIn the same month as the playoff loss to the Tennessee Titans, a trade was announced between the Chiefs and the [[Washington Redskins]], and after five years of starting at least fifteen games in each year, [[Alex Smith]] was traded to the Redskins. In return, the Chiefs received [[Kendall Fuller]] and a third-round pick.\n\nIn the [[2018 NFL Draft]], the Chiefs did not have a first-round selection due to their trade to acquire the selection to draft [[Patrick Mahomes]], but they traded up to select [[Breeland Speaks]] in the second round of the NFL Draft. This draft also demonstrated the emphasis on improving the defense as the Chiefs only selected defensive players in the draft.\n\nIdentically to 2017, the Chiefs started out the season 5\u20130 and then lost their following game to an AFC juggernaut, this time to the [[New England Patriots]] in primetime. During this stretch, Patrick Mahomes threw ten touchdown passes in his first two games and four more over the next three. This was the start of an incredible campaign for the 23-year-old, as he finished the season with over 5,000 yards and 50 touchdowns, being the second quarterback in NFL history to accomplish that feat, only behind [[Peyton Manning]]. After the Chiefs fell to the Patriots, they then won their next four to sit at 9\u20131 heading into their game against the also 9\u20131 [[Los Angeles Rams]]. While Patrick Mahomes threw six touchdown passes and led his team to over 50 points, he also had five turnovers and the Chiefs became the first team in NFL history to lose a game while also scoring 50 points or more, as the Chiefs lost 54\u201351. The Chiefs then won their next two games to clinch a playoff berth in Week 14 as they were able to beat the [[Baltimore Ravens]] in overtime and sit at 11\u20132 on the season. Only needing a victory to secure a first-round bye and a third consecutive [[AFC West]] title, the Chiefs fell short against the [[Los Angeles Chargers]] and fell to 11\u20133 on the season as they lost 29\u201328. After the Chargers lost the following Saturday to the Baltimore Ravens and the [[Houston Texans]] lost to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], the Chiefs only needed to beat the [[Seattle Seahawks]] to clinch the #1 seed in the AFC and an AFC West title. The Chiefs, however, fell short and lost 38\u201331. Now sitting at 11\u20134 and only needing to beat the Oakland Raiders to clinch the #1 seed in the AFC but also having the risk of falling all the way to the #5 seed, the Chiefs walloped the 4\u201311 [[Oakland Raiders]] 35\u20133, and clinched their third consecutive AFC West title and the #1 seed in the AFC for the first time since 1997.\n\nHeading into the [[2018\u201319 NFL playoffs]], the Chiefs were sitting at 12\u20134 and were the #1 seed in the AFC. After the Indianapolis Colts were able to beat the Houston Texans on the road, the Colts came to Kansas City to play the Chiefs in a divisional round matchup. The Colts to this point were 4\u20130 against the Chiefs in the playoffs and had given them plenty of trouble in the past. However, the Chiefs continued their stellar season with an impressive victory over the Colts, as the Chiefs won 31\u201313 and did not falter down the stretch like some of their previous postseason games in the Andy Reid era. This win came on a combination of four rushing touchdowns and a defense that only allowed six points, as the other seven came on a blocked punt that was recovered for a touchdown. With this victory, the Chiefs were able to host the [[AFC Championship Game]] for the first time in team history, and this was the first time ever that Kansas City had hosted a conference championship or a championship game in the AFL or NFL. After the New England Patriots beat the Los Angeles Chargers, the matchup was set: Patriots at Chiefs for the AFC Championship.\n\nIn the AFC Championship Game, the Chiefs started out slow and were shut out in the first half, and the Patriots were leading 14\u20130. By the fourth quarter, however, the Chiefs were winning 21\u201317. The teams traded blows during the fourth quarter, where the two teams combined to score 38 points in the quarter. Down 31\u201328 with one timeout and only thirty-nine seconds to go, the Chiefs were able to drive down the field and kick a field goal to send the game into overtime. However, the Chiefs did not win the coin toss and the Patriots received the ball to begin overtime. The Chiefs were able to get the Patriots into three 3rd down and 10 to go situations, however the Patriots converted on all of them and eventually scored a touchdown to win the game by a score of 37\u201331. It was the third consecutive year where the Chiefs had lost a playoff game by six points or less.\n\nThe 2018 Chiefs also became the first team in NFL history to score at least 26 points in all of their games.\n\n====2019====\n{{details|2019 Kansas City Chiefs season}}\nHeading into the 2019 offseason, the Chiefs had many key players that they cut, traded, or allowed to become free agents. Some of these players included [[Dee Ford]] (traded after being franchise tagged), [[Mitch Morse]], [[Chris Conley (American football)|Chris Conley]], Allen Bailey, Justin Houston, Eric Berry, and more. The Chiefs also had to find a new defensive coordinator after the firing of [[Bob Sutton (American football)|Bob Sutton]] following the collapse against New England in the AFC Championship game. The Chiefs would hire [[Steve Spagnuolo]] as their defensive coordinator on January 24, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bergman|first=Jeremy|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001013167/article/chiefs-hire-steve-spagnuolo-as-defensive-coordinator|title=Chiefs hire Steve Spagnuolo as defensive coordinator|publisher=[[National Football League]]|date=January 24, 2019|accessdate=January 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\nKansas City enjoyed a 4\u20130 start before losing to the [[2019 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] and [[2019 Houston Texans season|Houston Texans]].

''Psychoanalytic Studies of Personality'', a 1952 collection of Fairbairn's papers previously published in various psychoanalytic journals, includes four papers that contain most of his innovative concepts. \n\nFairbairn's model is  classified as a psychoanalytic model or theory because it shares the common assumption of all psychoanalytic models\u2014the belief that the fundamental source of human motivation originates in the unconscious\u2014as well as offering explanations of the origins and dynamics of transference, repetition compulsions, and resistance. His enormously ambitious goal was to replace Freudian [[metapsychology]] with his own. Fairbairn's vision of the human psyche was not based on the Freudian notion that the infant is overflowing with primitive drives needing to be tamed, but rather that the infant is seeking love and emotional attachment that can infuse him with the security he needs to explore the world, safe in the knowledge that he has parents ready to help him if he becomes overwhelmed in that exploration. Fairbairn's model offers a different theory of psychological development, a completely new vision of the structure and dynamics of the personality, a different source of the origins of psychopathology, and a different approach to the treatment of disordered individuals. Fairbairn's model also shifts the focus away from repression (of the Id's forbidden desires) and back to dissociation as humans' fundamental defense mechanism. \n\nGreenberg and Mitchell noted the basic changes promoted by Fairbairn:  \n<blockquote>\nIn a series of dense and fertile papers written during the early 1940's, W.R.D. Fairbairn developed a theoretical perspective which, along with Sullivan's \"interpersonal psychiatry\", provides the purest and clearest expression of the shift from the drive/structure model to the relational/structure model (Greenberg and Mitchell, 1983:151).<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Greenberg and Mitchell|first=Jay  and Stephen|title=Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-62975-2|location=|pages=151}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe psychoanalytic model Freud offers is a '''drive/structure model''': it proposes that human beings are born with innate, biological drives (e.g., sexual desire and aggression) contained in the unconscious Id. The infant's Id seeks discharge of its tensions regardless of the situation. When the discharging drive (hitting, biting, urinating, defecating) comes into contact with the demands and prohibitions of society, there is immediate conflict. A new structure must emerge from the Id of the growing infant to insure that its drives are expressed in a socially acceptable way. Thus the unconscious Id\u2014Freud's metaphor for the whole range and strength of biological drives\u2014is forced to develop contact with reality through the emergence of a second structure: the Ego. Thus the Ego has the task of mediating between the primitive Id and society. Later on in development (via the Oedipal Conflict), the child internalizes the values of his parents. These internalized values become the third internal structure, which is called the Super Ego. These three hypothetical ego structures\u2014Id, Ego, and Super Ego\u2014mature and grow with experience. Freud postulated that all psychological development is based on the Id seeking satisfaction, the Ego curbing the Id's most extreme demands, and the Super Ego pressing the Ego to make morally correct choices. \n\nIn contrast, Fairbairn's is a '''relational/structure model''' in its assumption that the human psyche develops its structure from actual human experience, not from pressure from the Id, whose existence Fairbairn rejects. Instead, Fairbairn proposes that the human psyche develops structures based on actual interpersonal events. A child's growing and maturing internal ego structures can be understood as packages of memories that coalesce and form internal representations of the parents, of the child himself, and of the child's relationship to his parents. For Fairbairn, the unconscious develops as a consequence of empathic failures of the parents that are too disruptive for the child's underdeveloped central ego to tolerate. Awareness of these failures would interfere with the child's absolute dependency on his parents, and knowledge of them would destroy the necessary illusion that he is loved and cherished. In families where punishment is frequent and severe, parental failures can be catastrophic to the child's developing sense of self. That is, the child can be so overwhelmed by parental aggression that it faces the loss of its sense of self, as described by Bromberg:     <blockquote>\nPsychological trauma occurs in situations, explicitly or implicitly interpersonal, in which self-invalidation (sometimes self-annihilation) cannot be escaped from or prevented, and from which there is no hope of protection, relief, or soothing. If the experience is either prolonged, [sic] assaultively violent, or if self-development is weak or immature, then the level of affective arousal is too great for the event to be experienced self-reflectively and given meaning through cognitive processing. \u2026 At its extreme, the subjective experience is that of a chaotic and terrifying flooding of affect that threatens to overwhelm sanity and psychological survival (Bromberg, 1998, 12).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bromberg|first=Philip|title=Standing in The Spaces: Essays on Clinical Process, Trauma and Dissociation|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=0-88163-356-9|location=|pages=12}}</ref>     \n</blockquote>\nOver time, these dissociated events, including those in which the child's sense of self was endangered, become ego structures in the individual's internal world. (See the following section on splitting of the ego for a detailed explanation of this process.) Thus the human psyche acquires structure from the tensions of split-off traumas so toxic they remain unavailable to the individual's central ego. Therefore, the unconscious is not a biological inheritance of humankind but a development of specific parental failures and interpersonal traumas that were dissociated because they were too disruptive to remember.\n\n===='Schizoid Factors in the Personality' (1940)====\n\nIn his first paper, Fairbairn observed that many of his patients seemed \"schizoid\", which he defined as any individual who showed evidence of  having '''splits in their ego structure''' directly resulting from dissociated memories in their central ego. (Today we would call these patients Personality Disordered.) The dissociated packages of memories are held in the unconscious, \"split-off\" from the conscious central ego which no longer knows that they exist. Thus, many reality-based traumas are no longer known to the individual, who becomes withdrawn for interpersonal interactions. Fairbairn defined the schizoid as having the three following characteristics: <blockquote>\n\u2026 (1) an attitude of omnipotence, (2) an attitude of isolation and detachment and, (3) a preoccupation with inner reality.\u2026 So as far as the preoccupation with inner reality is concerned, this is undoubtedly the most important of all schizoid characteristics; and it is not the less present whether inner reality be substituted for outer reality, identified with outer reality, or superimposed upon outer reality (Fairbairn, 1952, p:6-7).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Fairbairn|first=William Ronald Dodds|title=Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=0-7100-1361-2|location=London|pages=}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe more frequently a child encounters intolerable trauma, the larger the number of memories of actual lived experiences that are split off and unavailable to the conscious \"central ego\". The schizoid style of relating (or more accurately, non-relating) to others originates from repeated rejections of the child's legitimate need for love and emotional support during his developmental years. The schizoid child was raised by a mother who was unable to relate to her child with tender, loving emotions, and as a direct consequence of this rejection, the child withdraws into his inner world, which, though safer, is ultimately less satisfying. Fairbairn spells this out starkly:\n<blockquote>\nRegressive reinstatement of the early oral attitude (the earliest form of dependency) would appear to be most readily brought about by a situation of emotional frustration in which the child comes to feel (a) that he is not really loved for himself as a person by his mother, and (b) that his own love for his mother is not really valued and accepted by her. This is a highly traumatic situation, giving rise to a further situation characterized as follows: (a) the child comes to regard his mother as a Bad Object in so far as she does not seem to love him, (b) The child comes to regard outward expressions of his own love as bad, with the result that ... he tends to retain his love inside of himself. (c) The child comes to feel that love relationships with external objects in general are bad, or at least precarious (Fairbairn, 1952:17-18).<ref name=\":2\" /> \n</blockquote>\nFairbairn recognized that lack of love in a young child's life is traumatic and disruptive to his attachment. In his later papers (1943 &1944),he observed that the child protected himself from remembering these traumatic events by using  the dissociative defense to erase them form his conscious memory. \n\nTypically, Fairbairn returned again and again to topics that he had discussed in his early papers as he was gradually expanding his observations while creating a coherent model. For example, in a quote from his 1941 paper on the schizoid personality style, Fairbairn observes that the unloved child feels his love is destructive because his parents do not value or accept it, and because they do not return his love. Thus the child '''blames himself''' for not being lovable, which deflects the blame from his unloving parents on to himself. By blaming himself, he continues the illusion that he has loving parents that reject him for a good reason, i.e., that he and his love are toxic. This theme will come up again in the 1943 paper when Fairbairn described \"The Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\" a cognitive defense in which the child blames himself for the parental failures. In the next quote, Fairbairn uses the Freudian concept of 'libido', which was defined as the mix of sex and aggression in the Id. Fairbairn was forced to use the preexisting language of psychoanalysis, however he took the word \"libido\" and changed it to mean a child's love for his parents or love of other external objects:<blockquote>\nIt is the great tragedy of the schizoid individual that his love seems to destroy: and it is because his love seems so destructive that he experiences such difficulty in directing libido toward objects in outer reality. He becomes afraid to love: and therefore he erects barriers between his objects and himself. He tends to both keep his objects at a distance and to make himself remote from them. He rejects his objects: and at the same time he withdraws libido from them. This withdrawal of libido may be carried to all lengths. It may be carried to a point at which all emotional and physical contacts with other persons are renounced; and it may even go so far that all libidinal links with outer reality are surrendered, all interest in the world around fades and everything becomes meaningless. In proportion as libido is withdrawn from outer objects it is directed toward internalized objects: and in proportion as this happens the person becomes introverted (Fairbairn 1952, p.50)<ref name=\":2\" />.    \n</blockquote>\nSimply put, the unloved child who has directed his love toward his parents, only to be rebuffed, gives up hope that he will ever be loved, and as a consequence holds his love inside. He gives up on human relationships, focusing instead on his inner world and its fantasies and dreams of success.\n\n===='A Revised Psychopathology of the Psychoses and Psychoneuroses  (1941)'====\nFairbairn was gradually forming his model in these first papers. He  challenged Freud's drive theory directly in this second paper by  stating \"Nevertheless, it would appear as if the point had now been reached at which, in the interest of progress, the classical libido theory would have to be transformed into ''a theory of development based essentially upon object-relationships,'' Fairbairn (1952,p,31).<ref name=\":2\" />  Unfortunately, the shift in focus from drive theory to object relations theory was far too great for the psychoanalytic community to accept, because Freud's entire model was based on the existence and activity of libidinal drives. All of psychoanalysis was Freudian in the 1940s, there were no other options, and yet Fairbairn asked his colleagues to choose between his model and Freud's. They overwhelming chose Freud. From this point on, his model was seen as an \"interesting\" philosophical and intellectual exercise, rather than as a viable analytic model that would, over time, become one of the foundational models of \"Relational Psychoanalysis\" of simply \"Relationality\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Stephen|title=Relationality: From Attachment to Intersubjectivity|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=2000|isbn=0-88163-322-4|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell, Stephen & Aron, Lewis|first=|title=Relational Psychoanalysis: The Emergence of a Tradition|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=1999|isbn=0-88163-270-8|location=|pages=}}</ref>.\nFairbairn proposed an outline of a developmental model in this chapter as well. He noted that human development was characterized by a gradual differentiation (separation both physically and psychologically) from the parent because of the emergence  of a mature, reality based, central ego in the young adult. This allows the young adult to begin life on his own, find a partner and produce the next generation.<blockquote>The development of object-relationships is essentially a process whereby infantile dependence upon the object gradually gives place to mature dependence upon the object. The process of development is characterized (a) by the gradual abandonment of an original object relationship based on primary identification, and (b) the gradual adoption of an object-relationship based upon differentiation of the object (Fairbairn, 1952, p.34)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the development proceeds, the child gradually realizes that he is not part of his mother, but rather is an independent, fully functioning person. Unfortunately, many children are not supported and loved sufficiently to go through the \"transitional\" stage easily. They do not feel  secure and cannot engage in age appropriate activity with their peers. Instead, they are looking backwards toward their mother for more support, rather than toward the outside world of other children and healthy play. Fairbairn noted this in one of his most famous quotes:<blockquote>\nThe greatest need of a child is to obtain conclusive assurance (a) that he is genuinely loved as a person by his parents, and (b) that his parents genuinely accept his love. It is only in so far as such assurance is forthcoming in a form sufficiently convincing to enable him to depend safely upon his real objects (parents) that he is able to gradually renounce infantile dependence without misgiving. In the absence of such assurance his relationships to his objects is fraught with too much anxiety over separation to enable him to renounce the attitude of infantile dependence: for such a renunciation would be equivalent in his eyes to forfeiting all hope of ever obtaining the satisfaction of his unsatisfied emotional needs. '''Frustration of his desire to be loved as a person, and frustration of his desire to have his love accepted, is the greatest trauma that a child can experience''' (Fairbairn, 1952, p.39-40)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the dependent child cannot mature and go on to the next developmental step as he is fearful of increased separation from his parents without being sure of their love and support. The loved child does receive support and encouragement which gives him enough courage to let them go, and establish new relationships with peers and future partners. The child who is unsure of his parents' love remains emotionally underdeveloped, and often remains at home, trying to obtain the love that was not forthcoming in his developmental history (Celani, 2005)<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=Leaving Home|publisher=Columbia Universities Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13477-4|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>.  \n\nThe unloved child attempts to avoid further emotional rebuffs  by becoming increasingly \"schizoid\". That is, he turns away from the harsh and unloving world of his family and towards his internalized memories of others, including his parents, for reassurance that they are with him and available at all times. Unfortunately, most of his internalized memories are negative (see the relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object in the Splitting section). Despite the negativity, the endless struggle between these internalized split off part self and part object provides the comfort of the known and familiar. Clearly, this is a half measure, but it is the best that the ignored or rejected child can do under the circumstances, as he cannot change his parents or force them to love him.   \n\nSecondly, the rejected child comforts himself with \"substitutive satisfactions\"  which Fairbairn assumed were forms of immature sexuality. Today, the unloved, schizoid child has only to turn to the internet for an endless number of fantasy based videos that compensate him for his lack of love, lack of power,  and his desire for revenge, which temporarily lessens his pain. Fairbairn was clear about this regressive return to the inner world because of the harshness of the external world: \"Fundamentally, these substitutive satisfactions ...all represent ''relationships with internalized objects, to which the individual is compelled to turn in default of satisfactory relationships with objects in the outer world\"(Italics in the original) Fairbairn, 1952, p.40)''<ref name=\":2\" />. This observation of Fairbairn's has been validated by the millions of alienated and unloved children who spend hour upon hour avoiding interactions with external reality, including their family members, while immersed in their video fantasy world. This is the most satisfaction that they can get from their lives, as their relationships with their parents are so frustrating. \n\nFairbairn also discussed the difficulties in separating from unloving parents in this 1941 paper. He recognized that the lack of early support left the child with very few emotional resources to sustain himself when he left home and faced the world alone. He called the stage between \"infantile dependence\" and \"mature interdependence' the stage of \"Transition\".<blockquote>The great conflict of the transition stage may now be formulated as a conflict between a progressive urge to surrender the infantile attitude of identification with the object and a regressive urge to maintain that attitude. During this period, accordingly, the behavior of the individual is characterized both by desperate endeavors on his part to separate from the object and desperate endeavors to achieve reunion with the object-desperate attempts \"to escape from prison' and desperate attempts \"to return home\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.43).<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>The less the child has been supported in his early years, the less chance he/she has of a successful transition into adulthood. The huge number of \"adult\" aged individuals who either live at home with their aging parents, or others who live separately, but remain fixated in an adolescent time warp, is enormous. In either case, they have been unable to enter mature relationships because they are still seeking the support and encouragement that they missed out on in childhood <ref name=\":5\" />.   \n\n===='The Repression and the Return of Bad Objects (1943)' ====\nFairbairn's third theoretical paper further alienated those few members of the analytic community who found his work acceptable as he had the temerity to once again urge the replacement of drive theory with his object relations theory.<blockquote>Amongst the conclusions formulated in the above mentioned paper (his 1941 paper) two of the most far reaching are the following:(1) that libidinal \"aims\" are of secondary importance in comparison with object-relationships and (2) that a relationship with the object, and not gratification of the impulse, is the ultimate aim of libidinal striving (Fairbairn, 1952, p.60)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>Later on, in the same paper, Fairbairn added another comment that further alienated his analytic colleagues:  <blockquote>A point has now been reached at which the theory (Freud's Libido theory) has outworn its usefulness and, so far from providing impetus for further progress within the field of psychoanalytical thought, is actually operating as a brake upon the wheels (Fairbairn, 1952, p.72)<ref name=\":2\" />  </blockquote>This is '''not''' what the analytic community was looking for in 1943, as Fairbairn reduced Freud's concept of Libido to a secondary position as described his unique  vision of the child's motivation. He saw that all children sought out  good objects, in the hope of establishing  a loving  relationship with another human being. He then then formally re-defined the human unconscious, not as a container of biological drives, but rather a compendium of memories of interpersonal events that were too destructive to the child's needed attachment to his parents for his developing ego to accept. Fairbairn's \"challenge\" of the Freudian model did not pose a problem for the analytic community, despite the fact that Fairbairn's unconscious was so different from the \"standard\" Freudian view, simply because his model was politely ignored for forty years until 1983, until the publication of Greenberg and Mitchell's book \"Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory\",<ref name=\":6\" />. This alerted the younger members of the psychoanalytic community about Fairbairn's theory of psychoanalysis, and the renewed interest provoked numerous publications.  <blockquote>I now venture to formulate the view that what are primarily repressed are neither intolerably guilty impulses nor intolerably unpleasant memories, but intolerably bad internalized objects. If memories are repressed, accordingly, this is only because the objects involved in such memories are identified with bad internalized objects (Fairbairn, 1952,p.62)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>This assertion by Fairbairn: that the unconscious is composed of dissociated memories of parental failures was simply too much for the analytic community to bear. He dismissed Freud's notion of an unconscious populated by biological forces that were were seen to be (at that time)  the fundamental motivator of humankind. In Fairbairn's model, the dissociated memories  in the unconscious resonate throughout the individual's life. Note that Fairbairn was ahead of himself in this quote because  he had not yet defined a \"'''bad object'''\", which is a parent or guardian that the child looks to for love, help, guidance, and support, and who fails the child again and again. Also note that Fairbairn uses the word '''repressed''' rather than '''dissociated''' in this quote. Repression is used to describe the psychological defense of holding of material in the unconscious that is already present. Dissociation describes the psychological act of actively \"forgetting\" an overwhelmingly traumatic event that occurred in the external world, and instantaneously forcing it into the unconscious. Once the memory of the event is there it is held out of awareness by repression.        \n\nFairbairn also offered a clear pathway from dissociated memories of neglect and abuse to adult psychopathology in the following passage.  <blockquote>Whether any given individual becomes delinquent, psychoneurotic, psychotic or simply \"normal\" would appear to depend in the main upon the operation of three factors: (1) the extent to which bad objects have been installed in the unconscious, and the degree of badness by which they are characterized, (2) the extent to which the ego is identified with internalized bad objects, and (3) the nature and strength of the defenses which protect the ego from these objects (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>The child who is so unfortunate to be born in a family where the parents are absent, indifferent or abusive is going to experience and internalize a huge number of bad object interactions. These dissociated memories form large and powerful inner structures that will influence his view of himself and his perception of external reality. The second point in the quote describes how the individual's identification with the abuser can exacerbate the impact of the dissociated memories. For instance a boy who sees his father beat his mother may identify with this behavior and then re-enact this pattern in his adulthood. Conversely a female child might dis-identify with her father and, in adulthood, support abused women. The third factor, \"Defensiveness\".is also significant as the highly defended individual will remember little or nothing of the traumas he/she experienced in childhood and will have a greater probability of re-enacting one role or the other (the abuser of the victim) because he/she  has no ability to \"mentalize\", or think about and  process the traumatic events of their childhood. Thus, the highly defended individual will never comprehend what happened to them, and realize how their early history  influenced their adulthood. Instead, the internalized patterns will re-emerge and be acted out with the next generation. This is called the \"intergenerational transmission of trauma\".         \n\nFairbairn noticed that children who had been removed from their families because of extreme neglect or abuse (this was in Scotland during the 1930's) made endless excuses for their parents and assumed that they themselves were responsible for the treatment that they were receiving. That is, their parents were punishing them because they were dirty, disobedient, or lazy. The child assumed that he/she was the cause of the parent's hostile behavior toward them. Fairbairn called this the '''\"Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\"'''. Once again the child is desperate to support his illusion that he is living within a loving family, and that he/she is the cause of the strife.         <blockquote>It becomes obvious, therefore, that the child would rather be bad himself than have bad objects: and accordingly we have some justification for surmising that one of his motives in becoming bad is to make his objects \"good\". In becoming bad he is really taking upon himself the burden of badness which appears to reside in his objects. By this means he seeks to purge them of his badness: and in proportion as he succeeds in doing so, he is rewarded by that sense of security which an environment of good objects so characteristically confers....Outer security is thus purchased at the price of inner insecurity (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>This defense is a cognitive defense in that the child is explaining to himself why he is being punished or neglected. By saying it is his fault, he absolves his parents and gives them a \"good\" reason for treating him badly. As Fairbairn notes, it continues the pattern used by children to support the illusion that they are living in a loving family. The child prefers to believe that he has a \"moral\" defect, such as being lazy, disrespectful, or being chronically dirty, all of which are potentially correctable, than see that his parents are emotionally bankrupt. Worse, the defensive self blame erodes what little self worth the child may have developed. This defense is really a precursor to the splitting defense that Fairbairn described in his next paper (1944), in that it is a primitive form of splitting in that the parental objects are \"all good\", and the child himself is \"all bad\". Fairbairn never went back to his earlier concepts, like the moral defense, and updated them to fit in with his evolving thought.                                          \n\nThen Fairbairn returned to his earlier discussion, that he had begun in his 1940 and 1941 papers, on different aspects of the child's dependency on his objects. These concepts would have been more appropriate in his earlier papers where he first discussed the issue of dependency. However, the reader is given an opportunity to actually see how a major innovator of a psychoanalytic theory gradually creates a model. His mind was not linear, and many topics came to mind again and again, dependency being the most frequent topic. Here he observes the intense need of the child for his parents and the child's inability to reject them, regardless of how badly he/she was being treated:        <blockquote>The child not only internalizes his bad objects because they force themselves upon him and he seeks to control them, but also, and above all, because he ''needs'' them. If a child's parents are bad objects, he cannot eject them, even if they do not force themselves upon him: for he cannot do without them. '''Even if they neglect him, he cannot reject them: for if they neglect him, his need for them is increased''' (Fairbairn, 1952,p.67)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>Fairbairn made this revolutionary observation and, at the time, it went unnoticed. The '''neglected child needs the parent more, rather than less''' because the individual's earlier needs were never fulfilled, and they do not suddenly disappear or resolve themselves. This observation seems counter-intuitive when seen from an adult perspective, because a mature individual would leave a hostile or unloving interpersonal situation in a minute.  However, the reality of many  young adults from neglectful families is that their own unmet dependency needs pressure them to remain with their abusive parents.They may have unmet needs from age 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (and so on) that were  never met, so as a young adult this individual has '''no possibility whatsoever of separating''' from his neglectful parents, and beginning a life of his own. This was one of Fairbairn's great insights which can be seen in virtually all young patients.                                                              \n\nFairbairn then took up new topics in the same wide-ranging paper- which is one of his two greatest (the second being his 1944 paper, which will be described in the next section). The two topics were (1) his theory of treatment and (2) his view of resistance. Most of his work focuses on the Bad Object, and the many psychological problems it fostered. In this section of the paper he begins to think about the effects of a '''Good Object-''' one that fulfills the promise of being nurturant, loving, and supportive. As mentioned earlier, Fairbairn's model is symmetrical, in that good objects which are available and conscious (and which ideally should be present in every child's life) have the opposite effect as compared to bad objects. Here he notes that they can actually cure or at least mitigate, the effects of internalized bad objects.                 <blockquote>Nevertheless, I cannot help feeling that such results must be attributed, in part at least, to the fact that in the transference situation the patient is provided in reality with an unwontedly good object, and is thereby placed in a position to risk a release of his internalized bad objects from the unconscious and so to provide conditions for the libidinal cathexis of these objects to be dissolved--albeit he is also under a temptation to exploit a \"good\" relationship with the analyst, as a defense against taking this risk (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69).<ref name=\":2\" />                  </blockquote>Fairbairn identifies one of the key mutative factors in psychotherapy as the \"good relationship\" between the therapist and patient. The influence of a good object therapist should provoke a derepression (a release from the unconscious) of the memories of abuse and neglect that were previously unavailable to his conscious central ego. He sees the relationship between patient and therapist as providing the patient with enough confidence and support to allow him to \"remember\" what actually happened to him, as he has a new object upon whom he can depend. He  uses the word \"libidinal cathexis\" in his quote which is a holdover from the Freudian model. It means emotional investment of libidinal energy in the other person, which when translated into Fairbairn's terminology, means emotional attachment. Thus a relationship with a new, good object can loosen up the attachment to an internalized bad object, as the good object offers the patient an alternative attachment. In reality, this process seldom happens until treatment is well underway,  Most frequently the patient stubbornly clings to his illusions of a loving and supportive family as well as to the illusion that he is somehow defective and deserving of neglect or abuse.\n\nThe 1943  paper's title \"Repression and the Return of Bad Objects\" suggests that Fairbairn was going to address the reemergence of bad objects, which he does in a  comment on one of the fundamental sources of '''Resistance.''' Resistance describes the patient's attempts to remain the same and fight against the therapist's interventions during the process of psychotherapy, despite their conscious desire to change. As previously noted, Fairbairn's model is coherent, and given that the source of psychopathology is the internalization of bad objects because they were intolerable to accept, resistance comes from the patient's fear of acknowledging and accepting what happened to him in childhood despite the fact that these events occurred decades ago. This is true even if the parents are long deceased, because for the patient to accept what they did to him/her as a child will, in most cases, destroy all his illusions about them as parents and the \"goodness\" of his childhood. It also leaves the individual without a personal history, as he has to discard all his fantasies of being a member of a family. For a detailed description of how to manage patient resistance during the process of treatment see Celani, 2010 (pp,117-184)<ref name=\":4\" />. \n\nFairbairn's quote on resistance is graphic and to the point.<blockquote>There is little doubt in my mind that, in conjunction with another factor to be mentioned later, the deepest source of resistance is fear of the release of bad objects from the unconscious: for when such bad objects are released, the world around the patient becomes '''peopled with devils which are too terrifying for him to face'''...At the same time there is now little doubt in my mind that the release of bad objects from the unconscious is one of the chief aims which the psychotherapist should set himself out to achieve, even at the expense of a severe \"transference neurosis\": for it is only when the internalized bad objects are released from the unconscious that there is any hope of their cathexis being dissolved. The bad objects can only be safely released, however, if the analyst has become established as a sufficiently good object for the patient. Otherwise the resulting insecurity may prove insupportable (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69-70)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>Fairbairn's comment on the difficulty for patients to actually reexamine and tolerate the events that they had already suffered through, is absolutely correct. Exposure of the patient to the realities of his childhood can only be successfully managed when the patient is securely attached to the therapist as a good object, and thus will not feel abandoned when the illusions about his parents fall away. Fairbairn was both a philosopher and an advanced divinity student before becoming a physician and psychoanalyst, and often his language involves devils and angels, as it does in this quote. Later on the next page he ends his comment on resistance with the statement: \"It becomes evident, accordingly, that the psychotherapist is the true successor to the exorcist, and that he is concerned, not only with \"the forgiveness of sins\", but also with \"the casting out of devils\"\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.70).<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Endopsychic Structure Considered in terms of Object Relationships (1944) ===\n{{Main|Splitting of the Ego}}\nFairbairn's 1944 paper introduced the psychoanalytic community to his alternative view of the structure of the human personality which he saw as being the result of dissociation of intolerably frustrating experiences with the individuals parents. Before he introduced his model he commented on the ability of one structure (or sub-self) to repress another sub-self, and in so doing, become the executive (dominant) ego structure.   <blockquote>It is not inconceivable that one part of the \"ego\" with a dynamic charge should repress another part of the \"ego\" with a dynamic charge..In order to account for repression, we thus appear to be driven to the necessity of assuming a certain multiplicity of egos (Fairbairn, 1952, p.90)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>The ability of one ego state to repress another ego state is the central dynamic of the unconscious in Fairbairn's model. It accounts for the shifting of ego states that can occur when dissociated material has to be suddenly forced out of awareness.  \n\nHis 1944 paper also contained his further discussion of the child's dependency upon his object- a topic that he addressed in all four papers. Here, he highlights the crushing emotionality experienced by the child when his needs are rejected, and the tremendously frustrating position he is forces into, where he cannot complain about his rejection for fear of increased rejection. The following quote demonstrates Fairbairn's writing and his sensitivity to children's needs at their very best.  <blockquote>From the latter standpoint, what he experiences is a sense of lack of love, and indeed of emotional ''rejection'' on his mother's part. This being so, the expression of hate toward her as a rejecting object becomes in his eyes a very dangerous procedure. On the one hand, it is calculated to make her reject him all the more, and thus increase her badness and make her seem ''more real'' in her capacity as a bad object. On the other hand it is calculated to make her love him less, and thus to decrease her \"goodness' and make her seem ''less real'' (ie: destroy her) in her capacity of a good object. At the same time it also becomes a dangerous procedure for the child to express his libidinal need , i.e.his nascent love, of his mother in the face of rejection at her hands...In an older child this experience (showing love to a parent and having it rejected) is one of intense humiliation over the depreciation of his love, which seems to be involved. At a somewhat deeper level (or at an earlier stage) the experience is one of shame over the display of needs which are disregarded or belittled. In virtue of these experiences of humiliation and shame he feels reduced to a state of '''worthlessness,''' '''destitution''' or '''beggardom'''. His sense of his own value is threatened: and he feels bad in the sense of \"inferior (Fairbairn, 1952,pp.112-113)<ref name=\":2\" />   </blockquote>Thus the child can neither complain about his treatment for fear that he will be treated even more horribly, nor dare he offer his love to a parent who might reject and belittle him, as he has experienced in the the past. The child has no where to go and no one from whom he can seek help or appeal to, which is the position that millions of children are caught in at any given moment in time. Fairbairn gained his many insights to the plight of children from his work in the orphanage attached to the hospital in Edinburgh in which he worked (1927-1935)<ref name=\":7\" />, and he never forgot those experiences. \n\n==== An Outline of Fairbairn's Structural Model ====\nFairbairn's 1944 article describes his structural theory that he created from the careful and detailed analysis of a patient's dream (Fairbairn, 1952, pp.95-106)<ref name=\":2\" />. He observed that the patient had separate views of herself and of her significant others that could be understood as part-selves and part objects. Fairbairn saw that there were three pairs of structures- one pair was conscious and the other two pairs were largely unconscious.The fundamental position of Object Relations Theory is that for every developing self there has to be a object to whom it relates, thus every pair of structures contains a version of self paired with a version of the object (other person) to whom the self structure was relating. The two conscious structures are the  '''The Central Ego''' (the self structure) and its relationship to the '''Ideal Object''' (the other) , and '''two pairs of unconscious structures.''' The first pair of (mostly unconscious structures) are  '''The Antilibidinal Ego''' (the self structure) which is a representation of the neglected, humiliated and enraged child in a relationship to the '''Rejecting Object''', (the object structure) which is an internal representation of the abusive parent. The second pair of unconscious structures are  '''The Libidinal Ego''' (the self structure) which is the child's fantasy of the good parent whom he wishes for and his relationship to the '''Exciting Object''' (the object structure) which is a fantasy representation of the loving parent who offers him hope for the future.   \n\nThe reality that Fairbairn's structural theory contains six different structures is a source of difficulty in terms of its adoption by the analytic community, as it is more complex than Freud's three structure theory. It also forces the user to think in terms of self and object, rather that the individual in isolation. This model represents a whole new vision of the psychological functioning of the human personality, which is very different to the original Libido Theory. Fairbairn's model is one of relationships in which there are constant dialogues between the structures. That is, the relational pattern that was internalized during childhood includes  typical dialogues that were originally experienced in the external world, but now continue in the internal world. For example the antagonistic and bickering  relationship between the antilibidinal ego and the internalized rejecting object  continues unabated in dialogues between them, as described by Ogden.  <blockquote>\"Neither the rejecting object nor the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego) is willing or able to think about, much less relinquish, that tie. In fact, there is no desire on the part of either to change anything about their mutual dependence. The power of that bond is impossible to overestimate. The rejecting object and the internal saboteur are determined to nurse their feelings of having been deeply wronged, cheated, humiliated, betrayed, exploited, treated unfairly, discriminated against, and so on. The mistreatment at the hands of the other is felt to be unforgivable. An apology is forever expected by each, but never offered by either\" (Odgen,,2010,p.109)<ref>{{Citation|last=Ogden|first=Thomas H.|title=The International Journal of Psychoanalysis|date=2010|volume=91|pages=101-118|chapter=|publisher=|doi=|isbn=978-0-429-47453-8}}</ref></blockquote>Within the child's inner world (his unconscious) the '''antilibidinal ego''' '''relates only to the''' '''rejecting object,''' and this pair of self and object structures are unknown to the conscious central ego as well as to the libidinal ego. Similarly, '''the libidinal ego is unknown to both the central ego and to the antilibidinal ego.''' '''It relates only to the exciting object'''. Thus the inner world is structured as '''three different realities''', with each ego structure accurately reflecting the narrow slice of reality that it encountered before the reality had to be dissociated. \n\n'''Dissociation and the Splitting of the Ego''' \n\nPrior to Fairbairn, the defense of dissociation was seen as an extreme defense that was only used  in life-threatening situations. Fairbairn's work in an orphanage convinced him that  children separated from their families had experienced a major trauma that required the dissociative defense to prevent a complete psychic collapse. The dissociative defense erased the event from their consciousness. The memory of the abandonment  along with the  memory of the parents reasons for their actions are forced into the unconscious and held there by repression. This allows the abandoned child to continue loving a parent that he/she sees as completely supportive. In families where rejection is commonplace, the thousands upon thousands of dissociated memories accrue and become powerful sub-personalities. Memories of the angry, annoyed, rejecting or indifferent parent coalesce in the child's unconscious and become a single representation of the angry parent already described as the rejecting object. The child must also dissociate memories of himself during the interpersonally rejecting interactions into the antilibidinal ego. These memories of the child's self as suffused with fear, defeat, shame and humiliation that cannot be tolerated consciously.    \n\nIn extremely negative families there are so few supportive, positive interactions with the parents that the child is forced, by necessity to create hope for himself by developing a second set of views of himself in relationship to his parent. In Fairbairn's model '''the need of the child for a positive parent is so intense that the deprived child creates a \"good\" parent''' out of fantasy and hope.  This  second vision of the parent (mis)perceives the parent as filled with the potential of love. This vision of the parent is built out of the occasional positive or tender interaction that the child has experienced with his mostly rejecting parents.  This fantasy-based parent was called  the exciting object by Fairbairn, and the child's self that relates to it is the previously mentioned libidinal ego (or Self). The attachments of these  two mostly unconscious selves to these part objects constitutes what Fairbairn defined as an attachment to the '''Bad Object'''.  The Bad Object has two facets: the antilibidinal ego argues with and complains about its mistreatment to the rejecting object in an attempt to reform it, while the libidinal ego seeks ways to find out how to please the exciting object which promises it love which is always out of reach. Neither part-self (antilibidinal ego, Libidinal ego) is willing to give up their quest, and neither part object (rejecting object and exciting object) is willing to concede defeat. \n\n'''The Splitting''' '''Defense''' allows the child to hate the rejecting object with a feral rage, and to love the Exciting Object with all its heart. Splitting is a defense that prevents the integration of Good and Bad Object memories into a single whole object. Thus, the individual  '''never develops \"object constancy\"''' which is the ability to see a person's goodness, even when they are being rejected or frustrated by that person. Thus, a very important developmental milestone is not achieved, and the individual functions at an earlier stage of childhood development, often throughout life. Splitting causes the individual to respond to external objects '''as if they were two different people.''' When the individual is frustrated they see the object as '''\"all bad\"''' and devoid of any goodness. Conversely, when they are dominated by their  libidinal ego structure they see the object as \"'''all good'''\". This shift in ego states was described by Fairbairn in the earlier quote that addressed the fact that one ego state could repress another ego state. Developmentally, this is equivalent to the child who screams at her mother in a rage, and moments  later says \"I love you, Mommy\". The dominant ego state has no awareness of the other ego state which is repressed. Equally importantly, powerful, emotion filled memories are dissociated, which impoverishes and weakens the Central Ego, which is unaware of significant realities from its developmental history.<ref>{{Cite book|url=isbn 978-0-231-14907-5|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting Columbia University Press|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-3-11-053768-0|location=|pages=|oclc=1007218368}}</ref> \n\n==== The Variable Strength of the Ego Structures ====\nFairbairn's  structural model is the beginning stage of a multiple personality, however '''it never develops beyond this steady state.''' As described, the Central Ego develops in relationship to the supportive and nurturing parent(s), the Ideal Object(s). The strength and size of the Central Ego '''varies from child to child''' according to how many positive, ego enhancing activities and interpersonal events they have experienced with their parents during the course of  their development. Fairbairn's model assumes that actual events in reality summate in both the conscious Central Ego and in the unconscious structures as well. Thus large numbers of loving, non-intrusive, and emotionally supportive interactions with the parent(s) enhance the child's Central Ego through daily positive relating. As the child develops over time his trust in others allows him to interact with new adults and children and he is able to develop new skills, as well as enlarge a more complex view of himself through interactions with others who see aspects of himself that his parents have not discovered. \n\nIn less favorable developmental conditions, where support, nurturance and reassurance is scarce or absent, the child's Central Ego does not develop a richer and more rounded sense of self, rather the  development of his Central Ego is thwarted rather than enhanced. At the same time, his many negative experiences are being dissociated and repressed, and his Central Ego has lost sight of the many important (but negative) events in his childhood, which are banished (and remain) in his unconscious structures.  '''The ratio of''' '''conscious to unconscious structures''' shifts away from conscious relationships with external objects to the child's powerful and richly populated unconscious, with the endless bickering between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object, and the unrealistic fantasy world of the Libidinal Ego. A powerful unconscious influences the weakened Central Ego and is the source of both transference and repetition compulsions.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory In the Clinical Setting|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=New York|pages=51\u201371}}</ref> \n\n'''Transference, Resistance and Repetition Compulsions'''\n\nWhen any individual superimposes or projects his inner structures on an external object (for instance, his Rejecting Object) then he is going to misperceive that individual's intentions and behavior, and relate to him in a passive-aggressive and hostile manner. Thus projection of the inner structures onto external objects becomes the source of transference.  This happens when the unconscious structures are powerful and the Central Ego is weakened and has poor contact with external objects.<br />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.columbia.edu/~rr322/FAIRBAIRN.html 'Fairbairn's Structural Model'], Richard L.

''Psychoanalytic Studies of Personality'', a 1952 collection of Fairbairn's papers previously published in various psychoanalytic journals, includes four papers that contain most of his innovative concepts. \n\nFairbairn's model is  classified as a psychoanalytic model or theory because it shares the common assumption of all psychoanalytic models\u2014the belief that the fundamental source of human motivation originates in the unconscious\u2014as well as offering explanations of the origins and dynamics of transference, repetition compulsions, and resistance. His enormously ambitious goal was to replace Freudian [[metapsychology]] with his own. Fairbairn's vision of the human psyche was not based on the Freudian notion that the infant is overflowing with primitive drives needing to be tamed, but rather that the infant is seeking love and emotional attachment that can infuse him with the security he needs to explore the world, safe in the knowledge that he has parents ready to help him if he becomes overwhelmed in that exploration. Fairbairn's model offers a different theory of psychological development, a completely new vision of the structure and dynamics of the personality, a different source of the origins of psychopathology, and a different approach to the treatment of disordered individuals. Fairbairn's model also shifts the focus away from repression (of the Id's forbidden desires) and back to dissociation as humans' fundamental defense mechanism. \n\nGreenberg and Mitchell noted the basic changes promoted by Fairbairn:  \n<blockquote>\nIn a series of dense and fertile papers written during the early 1940's, W.R.D. Fairbairn developed a theoretical perspective which, along with Sullivan's \"interpersonal psychiatry\", provides the purest and clearest expression of the shift from the drive/structure model to the relational/structure model (Greenberg and Mitchell, 1983:151).<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Greenberg and Mitchell|first=Jay  and Stephen|title=Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-62975-2|location=|pages=151}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe psychoanalytic model Freud offers is a '''drive/structure model''': it proposes that human beings are born with innate, biological drives (e.g., sexual desire and aggression) contained in the unconscious Id. The infant's Id seeks discharge of its tensions regardless of the situation. When the discharging drive (hitting, biting, urinating, defecating) comes into contact with the demands and prohibitions of society, there is immediate conflict. A new structure must emerge from the Id of the growing infant to insure that its drives are expressed in a socially acceptable way. Thus the unconscious Id\u2014Freud's metaphor for the whole range and strength of biological drives\u2014is forced to develop contact with reality through the emergence of a second structure: the Ego. Thus the Ego has the task of mediating between the primitive Id and society. Later on in development (via the Oedipal Conflict), the child internalizes the values of his parents. These internalized values become the third internal structure, which is called the Super Ego. These three hypothetical ego structures\u2014Id, Ego, and Super Ego\u2014mature and grow with experience. Freud postulated that all psychological development is based on the Id seeking satisfaction, the Ego curbing the Id's most extreme demands, and the Super Ego pressing the Ego to make morally correct choices. \n\nIn contrast, Fairbairn's is a '''relational/structure model''' in its assumption that the human psyche develops its structure from actual human experience, not from pressure from the Id, whose existence Fairbairn rejects. Instead, Fairbairn proposes that the human psyche develops structures based on actual interpersonal events. A child's growing and maturing internal ego structures can be understood as packages of memories that coalesce and form internal representations of the parents, of the child himself, and of the child's relationship to his parents. For Fairbairn, the unconscious develops as a consequence of empathic failures of the parents that are too disruptive for the child's underdeveloped central ego to tolerate. Awareness of these failures would interfere with the child's absolute dependency on his parents, and knowledge of them would destroy the necessary illusion that he is loved and cherished. In families where punishment is frequent and severe, parental failures can be catastrophic to the child's developing sense of self. That is, the child can be so overwhelmed by parental aggression that it faces the loss of its sense of self, as described by Bromberg:     <blockquote>\nPsychological trauma occurs in situations, explicitly or implicitly interpersonal, in which self-invalidation (sometimes self-annihilation) cannot be escaped from or prevented, and from which there is no hope of protection, relief, or soothing. If the experience is either prolonged, [sic] assaultively violent, or if self-development is weak or immature, then the level of affective arousal is too great for the event to be experienced self-reflectively and given meaning through cognitive processing. \u2026 At its extreme, the subjective experience is that of a chaotic and terrifying flooding of affect that threatens to overwhelm sanity and psychological survival (Bromberg, 1998, 12).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bromberg|first=Philip|title=Standing in The Spaces: Essays on Clinical Process, Trauma and Dissociation|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=0-88163-356-9|location=|pages=12}}</ref>     \n</blockquote>\nOver time, these dissociated events, including those in which the child's sense of self was endangered, become ego structures in the individual's internal world. (See the following section on splitting of the ego for a detailed explanation of this process.) Thus the human psyche acquires structure from the tensions of split-off traumas so toxic they remain unavailable to the individual's central ego. Therefore, the unconscious is not a biological inheritance of humankind but a development of specific parental failures and interpersonal traumas that were dissociated because they were too disruptive to remember.\n\n===='Schizoid Factors in the Personality' (1940)====\n\nIn his first paper, Fairbairn observed that many of his patients seemed \"schizoid\", which he defined as any individual who showed evidence of  having '''splits in their ego structure''' directly resulting from dissociated memories in their central ego. (Today we would call these patients Personality Disordered.) The dissociated packages of memories are held in the unconscious, \"split-off\" from the conscious central ego which no longer knows that they exist. Thus, many reality-based traumas are no longer known to the individual, who becomes withdrawn for interpersonal interactions. Fairbairn defined the schizoid as having the three following characteristics: <blockquote>\n\u2026 (1) an attitude of omnipotence, (2) an attitude of isolation and detachment and, (3) a preoccupation with inner reality.\u2026 So as far as the preoccupation with inner reality is concerned, this is undoubtedly the most important of all schizoid characteristics; and it is not the less present whether inner reality be substituted for outer reality, identified with outer reality, or superimposed upon outer reality (Fairbairn, 1952, p:6-7).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Fairbairn|first=William Ronald Dodds|title=Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=0-7100-1361-2|location=London|pages=}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe more frequently a child encounters intolerable trauma, the larger the number of memories of actual lived experiences that are split off and unavailable to the conscious \"central ego\". The schizoid style of relating (or more accurately, non-relating) to others originates from repeated rejections of the child's legitimate need for love and emotional support during his developmental years. The schizoid child was raised by a mother who was unable to relate to her child with tender, loving emotions, and as a direct consequence of this rejection, the child withdraws into his inner world, which, though safer, is ultimately less satisfying. Fairbairn spells this out starkly:\n<blockquote>\nRegressive reinstatement of the early oral attitude (the earliest form of dependency) would appear to be most readily brought about by a situation of emotional frustration in which the child comes to feel (a) that he is not really loved for himself as a person by his mother, and (b) that his own love for his mother is not really valued and accepted by her. This is a highly traumatic situation, giving rise to a further situation characterized as follows: (a) the child comes to regard his mother as a Bad Object in so far as she does not seem to love him, (b) The child comes to regard outward expressions of his own love as bad, with the result that ... he tends to retain his love inside of himself. (c) The child comes to feel that love relationships with external objects in general are bad, or at least precarious (Fairbairn, 1952:17-18).<ref name=\":2\" /> \n</blockquote>\nFairbairn recognized that lack of love in a young child's life is traumatic and disruptive to his attachment. In his later papers (1943 &1944),he observed that the child protected himself from remembering these traumatic events by using  the dissociative defense to erase them form his conscious memory. \n\nTypically, Fairbairn returned again and again to topics that he had discussed in his early papers as he was gradually expanding his observations while creating a coherent model. For example, in a quote from his 1941 paper on the schizoid personality style, Fairbairn observes that the unloved child feels his love is destructive because his parents do not value or accept it, and because they do not return his love. Thus the child '''blames himself''' for not being lovable, which deflects the blame from his unloving parents on to himself. By blaming himself, he continues the illusion that he has loving parents that reject him for a good reason, i.e., that he and his love are toxic. This theme will come up again in the 1943 paper when Fairbairn described \"The Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\" a cognitive defense in which the child blames himself for the parental failures. In the next quote, Fairbairn uses the Freudian concept of 'libido', which was defined as the mix of sex and aggression in the Id. Fairbairn was forced to use the preexisting language of psychoanalysis, however he took the word \"libido\" and changed it to mean a child's love for his parents or love of other external objects:<blockquote>\nIt is the great tragedy of the schizoid individual that his love seems to destroy: and it is because his love seems so destructive that he experiences such difficulty in directing libido toward objects in outer reality. He becomes afraid to love: and therefore he erects barriers between his objects and himself. He tends to both keep his objects at a distance and to make himself remote from them. He rejects his objects: and at the same time he withdraws libido from them. This withdrawal of libido may be carried to all lengths. It may be carried to a point at which all emotional and physical contacts with other persons are renounced; and it may even go so far that all libidinal links with outer reality are surrendered, all interest in the world around fades and everything becomes meaningless. In proportion as libido is withdrawn from outer objects it is directed toward internalized objects: and in proportion as this happens the person becomes introverted (Fairbairn 1952, p.50)<ref name=\":2\" />.    \n</blockquote>\nSimply put, the unloved child who has directed his love toward his parents, only to be rebuffed, gives up hope that he will ever be loved, and as a consequence holds his love inside. He gives up on human relationships, focusing instead on his inner world and its fantasies and dreams of success.\n\n===='A Revised Psychopathology of the Psychoses and Psychoneuroses  (1941)'====\nFairbairn was gradually forming his model in these first papers. He  challenged Freud's drive theory directly in this second paper by  stating \"Nevertheless, it would appear as if the point had now been reached at which, in the interest of progress, the classical libido theory would have to be transformed into ''a theory of development based essentially upon object-relationships,'' Fairbairn (1952,p,31).<ref name=\":2\" />  Unfortunately, the shift in focus from drive theory to object relations theory was too great for the psychoanalytic community to accept, because Freud's entire model was based on the existence and activity of libidinal drives. All of psychoanalysis was Freudian in the 1940s, there were no other options, and yet Fairbairn asked his colleagues to choose between his model and Freud's. They overwhelming chose Freud. From this point on, his model was seen as an \"interesting\" philosophical and intellectual exercise, rather than as a viable analytic model that would, over time, become one of the foundational models of \"Relational Psychoanalysis\" of simply \"Relationality\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Stephen|title=Relationality: From Attachment to Intersubjectivity|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=2000|isbn=0-88163-322-4|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell, Stephen & Aron, Lewis|first=|title=Relational Psychoanalysis: The Emergence of a Tradition|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=1999|isbn=0-88163-270-8|location=|pages=}}</ref>.\nFairbairn proposed an outline of a developmental model in this chapter as well. He noted that human development was characterized by a gradual differentiation (separation both physically and psychologically) from the parent because of the emergence  of a mature, reality based, central ego in the young adult. This allows the young adult to begin life on his own, find a partner and produce the next generation.<blockquote>The development of object-relationships is essentially a process whereby infantile dependence upon the object gradually gives place to mature dependence upon the object. The process of development is characterized (a) by the gradual abandonment of an original object relationship based on primary identification, and (b) the gradual adoption of an object-relationship based upon differentiation of the object (Fairbairn, 1952, p.34)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the development proceeds, the child gradually realizes that he is not part of his mother, but rather is an independent, fully functioning person. Unfortunately, many children are not supported and loved sufficiently to go through the \"transitional\" stage easily. They do not feel  secure and cannot engage in age appropriate activity with their peers. Instead, they are looking backwards toward their mother for more support, rather than toward the outside world of other children and healthy play. Fairbairn noted this in one of his most famous quotes:<blockquote>\nThe greatest need of a child is to obtain conclusive assurance (a) that he is genuinely loved as a person by his parents, and (b) that his parents genuinely accept his love. It is only in so far as such assurance is forthcoming in a form sufficiently convincing to enable him to depend safely upon his real objects (parents) that he is able to gradually renounce infantile dependence without misgiving. In the absence of such assurance his relationships to his objects is fraught with too much anxiety over separation to enable him to renounce the attitude of infantile dependence: for such a renunciation would be equivalent in his eyes to forfeiting all hope of ever obtaining the satisfaction of his unsatisfied emotional needs. '''Frustration of his desire to be loved as a person, and frustration of his desire to have his love accepted, is the greatest trauma that a child can experience''' (Fairbairn, 1952, p.39-40)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the dependent child cannot mature and go on to the next developmental step as he is fearful of increased separation from his parents without being sure of their love and support. The loved child does receive support and encouragement which gives him enough courage to let them go, and establish new relationships with peers and future partners. The child who is unsure of his parents' love remains emotionally underdeveloped, and often remains at home, trying to obtain the love that was not forthcoming in his developmental history (Celani, 2005)<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=Leaving Home|publisher=Columbia Universities Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13477-4|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>.  \n\nThe unloved child attempts to avoid further emotional rebuffs  by becoming increasingly \"schizoid\". That is, he turns away from the harsh and unloving world of his family and towards his internalized memories of others, including his parents, for reassurance that they are with him and available at all times. Unfortunately, most of his internalized memories are negative (see the relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object in the Splitting section). Despite the negativity, the endless struggle between these internalized split off part self and part object provides the comfort of the known and familiar. Clearly, this is a half measure, but it is the best that the ignored or rejected child can do under the circumstances, as he cannot change his parents or force them to love him.   \n\nSecondly, the rejected child comforts himself with \"substitutive satisfactions\"  which Fairbairn assumed were forms of immature sexuality. Today, the unloved, schizoid child has only to turn to the internet for an endless number of fantasy based videos that compensate him for his lack of love, lack of power,  and his desire for revenge, which temporarily lessens his pain. Fairbairn was clear about this regressive return to the inner world because of the harshness of the external world: \"Fundamentally, these substitutive satisfactions ...all represent ''relationships with internalized objects, to which the individual is compelled to turn in default of satisfactory relationships with objects in the outer world\"(Italics in the original) Fairbairn, 1952, p.40)''<ref name=\":2\" />. This observation of Fairbairn's has been validated by the millions of alienated and unloved children who spend hour upon hour avoiding interactions with external reality, including their family members, while immersed in their video fantasy world. This is the most satisfaction that they can get from their lives, as their relationships with their parents are so frustrating. \n\nFairbairn also discussed the difficulties in separating from unloving parents in this 1941 paper. He recognized that the lack of early support left the child with very few emotional resources to sustain himself when he left home and faced the world alone. He called the stage between \"infantile dependence\" and \"mature interdependence' the stage of \"Transition\".<blockquote>The great conflict of the transition stage may now be formulated as a conflict between a progressive urge to surrender the infantile attitude of identification with the object and a regressive urge to maintain that attitude. During this period, accordingly, the behavior of the individual is characterized both by desperate endeavors on his part to separate from the object and desperate endeavors to achieve reunion with the object-desperate attempts \"to escape from prison' and desperate attempts \"to return home\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.43).<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>The less the child has been supported in his early years, the less chance he/she has of a successful transition into adulthood. The huge number of \"adult\" aged individuals who either live at home with their aging parents, or others who live separately, but remain fixated in an adolescent time warp, is enormous. In either case, they have been unable to enter mature relationships because they are still seeking the support and encouragement that they missed out on in childhood <ref name=\":5\" />.   \n\n===='The Repression and the Return of Bad Objects (1943)' ====\nFairbairn's third theoretical paper further alienated those few members of the analytic community who found his work acceptable as he had the temerity to once again urge the replacement of drive theory with his object relations theory.<blockquote>Amongst the conclusions formulated in the above mentioned paper (his 1941 paper) two of the most far reaching are the following:(1) that libidinal \"aims\" are of secondary importance in comparison with object-relationships and (2) that a relationship with the object, and not gratification of the impulse, is the ultimate aim of libidinal striving (Fairbairn, 1952, p.60)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>Later on, in the same paper, Fairbairn added another comment that further alienated his analytic colleagues:  <blockquote>A point has now been reached at which the theory (Freud's Libido theory) has outworn its usefulness and, so far from providing impetus for further progress within the field of psychoanalytical thought, is actually operating as a brake upon the wheels (Fairbairn, 1952, p.72)<ref name=\":2\" />  </blockquote>This is '''not''' what the analytic community was looking for in 1943, as Fairbairn reduced Freud's concept of Libido to a secondary position as described his unique  vision of the child's motivation. He saw that all children sought out  good objects, in the hope of establishing  a loving  relationship with another human being. He then then formally re-defined the human unconscious, not as a container of biological drives, but rather a compendium of memories of interpersonal events that were too destructive to the child's needed attachment to his parents for his developing ego to accept. Fairbairn's \"challenge\" of the Freudian model did not pose a problem for the analytic community, despite the fact that Fairbairn's unconscious was so different from the \"standard\" Freudian view, simply because his model was politely ignored for forty years until 1983, with the publication of Greenberg and Mitchell's book \"Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory\",<ref name=\":6\" />. This alerted the younger members of the psychoanalytic community to a new model of psychoanalysis, and the renewed interest provoked numerous publications.  <blockquote>I now venture to formulate the view that what are primarily repressed are neither intolerably guilty impulses nor intolerably unpleasant memories, but intolerably bad internalized objects. If memories are repressed, accordingly, this is only because the objects involved in such memories are identified with bad internalized objects (Fairbairn, 1952,p.62)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>Fairbairn was ahead of himself in this quote because  he had not yet defined a \"'''bad object'''\", which is a parent or guardian that the child looks to for love, help, guidance, and support, and who fails the child again and again. Note that Fairbairn uses the word '''repressed''' rather than '''dissociated''' in this quote. Repression is used to describe the psychological defense of holding of material in the unconscious that is already present. Dissociation describes the psychological act of actively \"forgetting\" an overwhelmingly traumatic event in the external world, and instantaneously forcing it into the unconscious. Once there it is held out of awareness by repression. When Fairbairn asserted that the unconscious is composed of dissociated memories of parental failures, he simultaneously dismissed Freud's notion of an unconscious populated by biological forces that were claimed to be the fundamental motivator of humankind. Once in the unconscious, they resonate throughout the individual's life.       \n\nFairbairn also offered a clear pathway from dissociated memories of neglect ad abuse to adult psychopathology in the following passage.  <blockquote>Whether any given individual becomes delinquent, psychoneurotic, psychotic or simply \"normal\" would appear to depend in the main upon the operation of three factors: (1) the extent to which bad objects have been installed in the unconscious, and the degree of badness by which they are characterized, (2) the extent to which the ego is identified with internalized bad objects, and (3) the nature and strength of the defenses which protect the ego from these objects (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>The child who is so unfortunate to be born in a family where the parents are absent, indifferent or abusive is going to experience and internalize a huge number of bad object interactions. These dissociated memories form large and powerful inner structures that will influence his view of himself and his perception of external reality. The second and third points in this quote describe how the individual's identification with the abuser, and the depth of the dissociated memories  can exacerbate or mitigate the impact of these bad object internalizations. For instance a boy who sees his father beat his mother may identify with this behavior and then re-enact this pattern in his adulthood. Conversely a female child might dis-identify with her father and, in adulthood, support abused women. The third factor, \"Defensiveness\" is also significant as the highly defended individual will remember little or nothing of the traumas he/she experienced in childhood and will have a greater probability of re-enacting one role or the other because they have no ability to \"mentalize\", or think about and  process the traumatic events of their childhood. Thus, the highl defended individual will never comprehend what happened to them, and how it influenced their adulthood. Instead, the internalized patterns will re-emerge and be acted out with the next generation. This is called the \"intergenerational transmission of trauma\".                                          \n\nFairbairn noticed that children who had been removed from their families because of extreme neglect or abuse (this was in Scotland during the 1930's) made endless excuses for their parents and assumed that they themselves were responsible for the treatment that they were receiving. That is, their parents were punishing them because they were dirty, disobedient, or lazy. The child assumed that he/she was the cause of the parent's hostile behavior toward them. Fairbairn called this the \"Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\". Once again the child is desperate to support his illusion that he is living within a loving family, and that he/she is the cause of the strife.         <blockquote>It becomes obvious, therefore, that the child would rather be bad himself than have bad objects: and accordingly we have some justification for surmising that one of his motives in becoming bad is to make his objects \"good\". In becoming bad he is really taking upon himself the burden of badness which appears to reside in his objects. By this means he seeks to purge them of his badness: and in proportion as he succeeds in doing so, he is rewarded by that sense of security which an environment of good objects so characteristically confers....Outer security is thus purchased at the price of inner insecurity (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>This defense is a cognitive defense in that the child is explaining to himself why he is being punished or neglected. By saying it is his fault, he absolves his parents and gives them a \"good\" reason for treating him badly. As Fairbairn notes, it continues the pattern of using defenses to support the illusion that he/she is living in a loving family. The child prefers to believe that he has a \"moral\" defect, such as being lazy, disrespectful, or being chronically dirty, all of which are potentially correctable, than see that his parents are emotionally bankrupt. Worse, the defensive self blame erodes what little self worth the child may have developed. This defense is really a precursor to the splitting defense that Fairbairn described in his next paper (1944), in that it is a primitive form of splitting in that the parental objects are \"all good\", and the child himself is \"all bad\". Fairbairn never went back to his earlier concepts, like the moral defense, and updated them to fit in with his evolving thought.                          \n\nThen Fairbairn returned to his earlier discussion, that he had begun in his 1940 and 1941 papers, on different aspects of the child's dependency on his objects. These concepts would have been more appropriate in his earlier papers where he first discussed the issue of dependency. However, the reader is given an opportunity to actually see how a major innovator of a psychoanalytic theory gradually creates a model. His mind was not linear, and many topics came to mind again and again, dependency being the most frequent topic. Here he observes the intense need of the child for his parents and the child's inability to reject them, regardless of how badly he/she was being treated:        <blockquote>The child not only internalizes his bad objects because they force themselves upon him and he seeks to control them, but also, and above all, because he ''needs'' them. If a child's parents are bad objects, he cannot eject them, even if they do not force themselves upon him: for he cannot do without them. '''Even if they neglect him, he cannot reject them: for if they neglect him, his need for them is increased''' (Fairbairn, 1952,p.67)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>Fairbairn made this revolutionary observation and, at the time, it went unnoticed. The '''neglected child needs the parent more, rather than less''' because the individual's earlier needs were never fulfilled, and they do not suddenly disappear or resolve themselves. This observation seems counter-intuitive when seen from an adult perspective, because a mature individual would leave a hostile or unloving interpersonal situation in a minute.  However, the reality of many  young adults from neglectful families is that their own unmet dependency needs pressure them to remain with their abusive parents.They may have unmet needs from age 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (and so on) that were  never met, so as a young adult this individual has '''no possibility whatsoever of separating''' from his neglectful parents, and beginning a life of his own. This was one of Fairbairn's great insights which can be seen in virtually all young patients.                                                                                               \n\nFairbairn then took up new topics in the same wide-ranging paper- which is one of his two greatest (the second being his 1944 paper, which will be described in the next section). The two topics were (1) his theory of treatment and (2) his view of resistance. Most of his work focuses on the Bad Object, and the many psychological problems it fostered. Here he begins to think about the effects of a Good Object- one that fulfills the promise of being nurturant, loving, and supportive. As mentioned earlier, Fairbairn's model is symmetrical, in that good objects which are available and conscious (and which ideally should be present in every child's life) have the opposite effect as compared to bad objects. Here he notes that they can actually cure or at least mitigate, the effects of internalized bad objects.                 <blockquote>Nevertheless, I cannot help feeling that such results must be attributed, in part at least, to the fact that in the transference situation the patient is provided in reality with an unwontedly good object, and is thereby placed in a position to risk a release of his internalized bad objects from the unconscious and so to provide conditions for the libidinal cathexis of these objects to be dissolved--albeit he is also under a temptation to exploit a \"good\" relationship with the analyst, as a defense against taking this risk (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69).<ref name=\":2\" />                  </blockquote>Fairbairn identifies one of the key mutative factors in psychotherapy as the \"good relationship\" between the therapist and patient. The influence of a good object therapist should provoke a derepression (a release from the unconscious) of the memories of abuse and neglect that were previously unavailable to his conscious central ego. He sees the relationship between patient and therapist as providing the patient with enough confidence and support to allow him to \"remember\" what actually happened to him, as he has a new object upon whom he can depend. He  uses the word \"libidinal cathexis\" in his quote which is a holdover from the Freudian model. It means emotional investment of libidinal energy in the other person, which when translated into Fairbairn's terminology, means emotional attachment. Thus a relationship with a new, good object can loosen up the attachment to an internalized bad object, as the good object offers the patient an alternative attachment. In reality, this process seldom happens until treatment is well underway,  Most frequently the patient stubbornly clings to his illusions of a loving and supportive family as well as to the illusion that he is somehow defective and deserving of neglect or abuse.\n\nThe 1943  paper's title \"Repression and the Return of Bad Objects\" suggests that Fairbairn was going to address the reemergence of bad objects, which he does in a  comment on one of the fundamental sources of '''Resistance.''' Resistance describes the patient's attempts to remain the same and fight against the therapist's interventions during the process of psychotherapy, despite their conscious desire to change. As previously noted, Fairbairn's model is coherent, and given that the source of psychopathology is the internalization of bad objects because they were intolerable to accept, resistance comes from the patient's fear of acknowledging and accepting what happened to him in childhood despite the fact that these events occurred decades ago. This is true even if the parents are long deceased, because for the patient to accept what they did to him/her as a child will, in most cases, destroy all his illusions about them as parents and the \"goodness\" of his childhood. It also leaves the individual without a personal history, as he has to discard all his fantasies of being a member of a family. For a detailed description of how to manage patient resistance during the process of treatment see Celani, 2010 (pp,117-184)<ref name=\":4\" />. \n\nFairbairn's quote on resistance is graphic and to the point.<blockquote>There is little doubt in my mind that, in conjunction with another factor to be mentioned later, the deepest source of resistance is fear of the release of bad objects from the unconscious: for when such bad objects are released, the world around the patient becomes '''peopled with devils which are too terrifying for him to face'''...At the same time there is now little doubt in my mind that the release of bad objects from the unconscious is one of the chief aims which the psychotherapist should set himself out to achieve, even at the expense of a severe \"transference neurosis\": for it is only when the internalized bad objects are released from the unconscious that there is any hope of their cathexis being dissolved. The bad objects can only be safely released, however, if the analyst has become established as a sufficiently good object for the patient. Otherwise the resulting insecurity may prove insupportable (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69-70)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>Fairbairn's comment on the difficulty for patients to actually reexamine and tolerate the events that they had already suffered through, is absolutely correct. Exposure of the patient to the realities of his childhood can only be successfully managed when the patient is securely attached to the therapist as a good object, and thus will not feel abandoned when the illusions about his parents fall away. Fairbairn was both a philosopher and an advanced divinity student before becoming a physician and psychoanalyst, and often his language involves devils and angels, as it does in this quote. Later on the next page he ends his comment on resistance with the statement: \"It becomes evident, accordingly, that the psychotherapist is the true successor to the exorcist, and that he is concerned, not only with \"the forgiveness of sins\", but also with \"the casting out of devils\"\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.70).<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Endopsychic Structure Considered in terms of Object Relationships (1944) ===\n{{Main|Splitting of the Ego}}\nFairbairn's 1944 paper introduced the psychoanalytic community to his alternative view of the structure of the human personality which he saw as being the result of dissociation of intolerably frustrating experiences with the individuals parents. Before he introduced his model he commented on the ability of one structure (or sub-self) to repress another sub-self, and in so doing, become the executive (dominant) ego structure.   <blockquote>It is not inconceivable that one part of the \"ego\" with a dynamic charge should repress another part of the \"ego\" with a dynamic charge..In order to account for repression, we thus appear to be driven to the necessity of assuming a certain multiplicity of egos (Fairbairn, 1952, p.90)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>The ability of one ego state to repress another ego state is the central dynamic of the unconscious in Fairbairn's model. It accounts for the shifting of ego states that can occur when dissociated material has to be suddenly forced out of awareness.  \n\n==== An Outline of Fairbairn's Structural Model ====\nFairbairn's 1944 article describes his structural theory that he created from the analysis of a patient's dream (Fairbairn, 1952, pp.95-106)<ref name=\":2\" />. He observed that the patient had separate views of herself and of her significant others that could be understood as part-selves and part objects. Fairbairn saw that there were three pairs of structures- one pair was conscious and the other two pairs were largely unconscious.The fundamental position of Object Relations Theory is that for every developing self there has to be a object to whom it relates, thus every pair of structures contains a sense of self paired with the object (other person) to whom the self structure was relating. The two conscious structures are the  '''The Central Ego''' (the self structure) and its relationship to the '''Ideal Object''' (the other) , and '''two pairs of unconscious structures.''' The first pair of (mostly unconscious structures) are  '''The Antilibidinal Ego''' (the self structure) which is a representation of the neglected, humiliated and enraged child in a relationship to the '''Rejecting Object''', (the object structure) which is an internal representation of the abusive parent. The second pair of unconscious structures are  '''The Libidinal Ego''' (the self structure) which is the child's fantasy of the good parent whom he wishes for and its relationship to the '''Exciting Object''' (the object structure) which is a fantasy representation of the loving parent who offers him hope for the future..   \n\nThe reality that Fairbairn's structural theory contains six different structures is a source of difficulty in terms of its adoption by the analytic community, as it is more complex than Freud's three structure theory. It also forces the user to think in terms of self and object, rather that the individual in isolation. This model represents a whole new vision of the psychological functioning of the human personality, which is very different to the original Libido Theory. Fairbairn's model is one of relationships and there are dialogues between the structures. That is, the relational pattern that was internalized during childhood includes the typical dialogues that were originally experienced in the external world, but now continue in the internal world. For example the antagonistic and bickering  relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the internalized Rejecting Object  continues unabated in dialogues between them, as described by Ogden.  <blockquote>\"Neither the rejecting object nor the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego) is willing or able to think about, much less relinquish, that tie. In fact, there is no desire on the part of either to change anything about their mutual dependence. The power of that bond is impossible to overestimate. The rejecting object and the internal saboteur are determined to nurse their feelings of having been deeply wronged, cheated, humiliated, betrayed, exploited, treated unfairly, discriminated against, and so on. The mistreatment at the hands of the other is felt to be unforgivable. An apology is forever expected by each, but never offered by either\" (Odgen,2010)<ref>{{Citation|last=Ogden|first=Thomas H.|title=The International Journal of Psychoanalysis|date=2010|volume=91|pages=101-118|chapter=|publisher=|doi=|isbn=978-0-429-47453-8}}</ref></blockquote>Within the child's inner world (his unconscious) the '''antilibidinal ego''' '''relates only to the''' '''rejecting object,''' and this pair of self and object structures are unknown to the conscious central ego as well as to the libidinal ego. Similarly, '''the libidinal ego is unknown to both the central ego and to the antilibidinal ego.''' '''It relates only to the exciting object'''. Thus the inner world is structured as '''three different realities''', with each ego structure accurately reflecting the narrow slice of reality that it encountered before the reality had to be dissociated. \n\n'''Dissociation and the Splitting of the Ego''' \n\nPrior to Fairbairn, the defense of dissociation was seen as an extreme defense that was only used  in life-threatening situations. Fairbairn's work in an orphanage associated with the University of Edinburgh <ref>{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's journey into the interior|last=Sutherland, John Derg, 1905- ...|date=1999|publisher=Free Association Books|isbn=1-85343-059-5|oclc=470458410}}</ref>convinced him that  children separated from their families experienced a major trauma that required the dissociative defense to prevent a complete psychic collapse. The dissociative defense erased the event from their consciousness. The memory of the abandonment  along with the  memory of the parents reasons for their actions are forced into the unconscious and held there by repression. This allows the abandoned child to continue loving a parent that he/she sees as completely supportive. In families where rejection is commonplace, the thousands upon thousands of dissociated memories accrue and become powerful sub-personalities. Memories of the angry, annoyed, rejecting or indifferent parent coalesce in the child's unconscious and become a single representation of the angry parent already described as the rejecting object. The child must also dissociate memories of himself during the interpersonally rejecting interactions into the antilibidinal ego. These memories of the child's self as suffused with fear, defeat, shame and humiliation cannot be tolerated consciously.    \n\nIn extremely negative families there are so few supportive, positive interactions with the parents that the child is forced, by necessity to create hope for himself by developing a second set of views of himself in relationship to his parent. In Fairbairn's model the need of the child for a positive parent is so intense that the deprived child creates a \"good\" parent   The child avoids feeling lost and abandoned by creating a second vision of the parent, one that is based on idealization and fantasy which (mis)perceives the parent as filled with the potential of love. This second vision of the parent is built out of the occasional positive or tender interaction that he has experienced with his mostly rejecting parents.  This fantasy-based parent is the exciting object by Fairbairn, and the child's self that relates to it is the previously mentioned libidinal ego (or Self). The attachments of these  two mostly unconscious selves to these part objects constitutes what Fairbairn defined as an attachment to the '''Bad Object'''.  The Bad Object has two facets: the Antilibidinal Ego argues with and complains about its mistreatment to the Rejecting Object in an attempt to reform it, while the Libidinal Ego seeks ways to find out how to please the Exciting Object which promises it love which is always out of reach. \n\n'''The Splitting''' '''Defense''' allows the child to hate the rejecting object with a feral rage, and to love the Exciting Object with all its heart. Splitting is a defense that prevents the integration of Good and Bad Object memories into a single whole object. Thus, the individual  '''never develops \"object constancy\"''' which is the ability to see a person's goodness, even when they are being rejected or frustrated by that person. Thus, a very important developmental milestone is not achieved, and the individual functions at an earlier stage of childhood development, often throughout life. Splitting causes the individual to respond to external objects '''as if they were two different people.''' When the individual is frustrated they see the object as \"all bad\" and devoid of any goodness. Conversely, when they are dominated by their  libidinal ego structure they see the object as \"all good\". This shift in ego states was described by Fairbairn in the earlier quote that addressed the fact that one ego state could repress another ego state. Developmentally, this is equivalent to the child who screams at her mother in a rage, and moments  later says \"I love you, Mommy\". The dominant ego state has no awareness of the other ego state which is repressed. Equally importantly, powerful, emotion filled memories are dissociated, which impoverishes and weakens the Central Ego, which is unaware of significant realities from its developmental history.<ref>{{Cite book|url=isbn 978-0-231-14907-5|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting Columbia University Press|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-3-11-053768-0|location=|pages=|oclc=1007218368}}</ref> \n\n==== The Variable Strength of the Ego Structures ====\nFairbairn's  structural model is the beginning stage of a multiple personality, however '''it never develops beyond this steady state.''' As described, the Central Ego develops in relationship to the supportive and nurturing parent(s), the Ideal Object(s). The strength and size of the Central Ego '''varies from child to child''' according to how many positive, ego enhancing activities and interpersonal events they have experienced during their development. Fairbairn's model assumes that actual events in reality summate in both the conscious Central Ego and in the unconscious structures as well. Thus large numbers of loving, non-intrusive, and emotionally supportive interactions with the parent(s) enhance the child's Central Ego through daily positive relating. As the child develops over time his trust in others allows him to interact with new adults and children and is able to develop new skills, as well as enlarge a more complex view of himself through interactions with others who see aspects of himself that his parents have not discovered. \n\nIn less favorable developmental conditions, where support, nurturance and reassurance is scarce or absent, the child's Central Ego does not develop a richer and more rounded sense of self, rather the  development of his Central Ego is thwarted rather than enhanced. At the same time, his many negative experiences are being dissociated and repressed, and his Central Ego has lost sight of the many important (but negative) events in his childhood, which are banished (and remain) in his unconscious structures.  '''The ratio of''' '''conscious to unconscious structures''' shifts away from conscious relationships with external objects to the child's powerful and richly populated unconscious, with the endless bickering between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object, and the unrealistic fantasy world of the Libidinal Ego. A powerful unconscious influences the weakened Central Ego and is the source of both transference and repetition compulsions.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory In the Clinical Setting|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=New York|pages=51\u201371}}</ref> \n\n'''Transference, Resistance and Repetition Compulsions'''\n\nWhen any individual superimposes or projects his inner structures on an external object (for instance, his Rejecting Object) then he is going to misperceive that individual's intentions and behavior, and relate to him in a passive-aggressive and hostile manner. Thus projection of the inner structures onto external objects becomes the source of transference.  This happens when the unconscious structures are powerful and the Central Ego is weakened and has poor contact with external objects.<br />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.columbia.edu/~rr322/FAIRBAIRN.html 'Fairbairn's Structural Model'], Richard L.

Snakes were often also associated with immortality because they were observed biting their tails to form a circle and when they coiled they formed spirals. Both circles and spirals were seen as symbols of [[eternity]]. The circle was particularly important to [[Dahomey]]an myth where the snake-god Danh circled the world like a belt, corsetting it and preventing it from flying apart in splinters. In [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian myth]], the state of existence before creation was symbolised as [[Amduat]], a many-coiled serpent from which [[Ra]] the [[Sun]] and all of creation arose, returning each night and being reborn every morning. Also, the snake biting its tail ([[Ouroboros]]) symbolised the [[sea]] as the eternal ring which enclosed the world. In Egypt the snake has healing abilities. Hymns and offerings were made to it since it was believed that the Goddess could manifest through the snake. \n\"In a hymn to the goddess [[Meretseger|Mertseger]], a workman on the Necropolis of Thebes relates how the goddess came to him in the form of a snake to heal his illness (Bunn1967:617).''<ref>{{cite book|title=Snake and staff symbolism and healing|year=2005|pages=190|url=http://www.ajol.info/index.php/actat/article/viewFile/52573/41178.}}</ref> \n\nIn [[Serer creation myth|Serer cosmogony]] and [[Serer religion|religion]], the serpent is the symbol of the [[pangool]], the saints and ancestral spirits of the [[Serer people]] of [[West Africa]]. When a person dies, the Serer believe that their soul must make its way to ''Jaaniiw'' (a place where goods souls go). Before the soul can reach Jaaniiw in order to ''reincarnate'' (''cii\u0257'' in [[Serer language|Serer]]<ref>[[Louis Di\u00e8ne Faye|Faye, Louis Di\u00e8ne]], ''Mort et Naissance le monde Sereer'', Les Nouvelles Editions Africaines (1983) pp. 9\u201410. {{ISBN|2723608689}}</ref>), it must transform into a black snake. During this transformation, the snake hides in a tree. For this reason, it is taboo in Serer culture to kill snakes.

In [[Code of Hammurabi|Hammurabi\u2019s Law Code]] (c. 1700 BC) the god [[Ninazu]] is identified as the patron of healing, and his son, [[Ningishzida]], is depicted with a serpent and staff symbol (Bunn 1967:618)\n\n==Creation myths==\nSnakes were a common feature of many [[creation myth]]s, for example many people in [[california]] and [[Australia]] had myths about the [[Rainbow Serpent|Rainbow Snake]], which was either [[Mother goddess|Mother Earth]] herself giving birth to all animals or a water-god whose writhings created rivers, creeks and oceans. In [[History of India|ancient India]]n myth, the drought-serpent [[Ahi (Hinduism)|Ahi]] or [[Vritra]] swallowed the [[primordial ocean]] and did not release all created beings until [[Indra]] split the serpent's stomach with a [[thunderbolt]]. In another myth, the protector [[Vishnu]] slept on the coils of the world-serpent [[Shesha]] (or \"[[Shesha|Ananta]] the endless\";). Shesha in turn was supported on [[Kurma]] and when Kurma moved, Shesha stirred and yawned and the gaping of its jaws caused [[earthquakes]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Eliade|first=Mircea|title=The Myth of the Eternal Return|year=2005|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-12350-0}}</ref> \n\nIn [[Chinese mythology]], the woman-headed snake [[N\u00fcwa]] made the first humans.

This symbol has many interpretations, one of which is the snake representing cyclical nature of life and death, life feeding on itself in the act of creation.\n\n==The underworld==\nSnakes were regularly regarded as guardians of the  [[Underworld]] or messengers between the Upper and Lower worlds because they lived in cracks and holes in the ground. The [[Gorgons]] of Greek myth were snake-women (a common hybrid) whose gaze would turn flesh into stone, the most famous of them being [[Medusa]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Medusa and Gorgons|url=http://www.theoi.com/Pontios/Gorgones.html}}</ref>  [[Naga (mythology)|Nagas]], \"the demon cobra\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Mallison|first=Fran\u00e7oise|title=Gin\u0101ns: Texts and Contexts : Essays on Ismaili Hymns from South Asia in honour of Zawahir  Moir|year=2007|publisher=Primus Books|location=Delhi|isbn=978-81-908918-7-5|pages=117,120|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=xmh3gQjPHkAC&pg=PA117 }}</ref> and naginis were human-headed snakes whose kings and queens who lived in jewel-encrusted underground or underwater paradises and who were perpetually at war with [[Garuda]] the Sun-bird.

He is almost always portrayed as a serpent or dragon depending on the particular myth. The underworld was part of a mythical world tree. The roots of this tree (usually growing in water) were guarded by [[Veles (god)|Veles]] (Volos) the serpent god.  \n\nThe idea of snake-people living below the Earth was prominent in [[American mythology|American myth]]. The [[Aztec]] underworld, [[Mictlan]] was protected by python-trees, a gigantic alligator and a snake, all of which spirits had to evade by physical ducking and weaving or cunning, before they could start the journey towards immortality. In [[North America]], the Brule [[Sioux]] people told of three brothers transformed into [[rattlesnake]]s which permanently helped and guided their human relatives.\n\nThe [[Pomo]] people told of a woman who married a rattlesnake-prince and gave birth to four snake-children who freely moved between the two worlds of their parents. The [[Hopi]] people told of a young man who ventured into the underworld and married a snake-princess. Amongst the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] people is a tale of Glispa, a girl returned with magical healing lore after spending two years with the Snake People by the Lake of Emergence in the underworld.<ref>{{cite book|last=Klah|first=Hasteen|title=Navajo Creation Myth: The Story of the Emergence|publisher=Museum of Navajo ceremonial art|year=1942|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.89349 }}</ref>\n\n==Water==\nSnakes were also commonly associated with water especially myths about the primordial ocean being formed of a huge coiled snake as in [[Ahi (Hinduism)|Ahi]]/[[Vritra]] in early Indian myth and [[Jormungand]] in [[Nordic mythology|Nordic myth]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Ashworth|first=Leon|title=Vikings and Northlands|year=2006|publisher=Evans Brothers Limited|isbn=9781842342701|url=https://books.google.com/books?&lr=&id=dWF0kHApmNIC&oi=fnd&pg=PA3}}</ref> Sea monsters lived in every ocean from the seven-headed crocodile-serpent [[Leviathan]] of [[Aggadah|Hebrew myth]] to the sea-god Koloowisi of the [[Zuni people]] of North America and the Greek monster [[Scylla]] with twelve snake-necks. In some cultures, eels (which spend their early lives in freshwater before returning to the sea as adults) were regarded as magical creatures.\n\nRivers and lakes often had snake-gods or snake-guardians including [[Untekhi]] the fearsome water-spirit of the [[Missouri River]]. Until recently, some northern European communities held [[well dressing]] ceremonies to appease the snake-spirits which lived in village wells and told legends of saints defeating malevolent lake-snakes e.g. [[Saint George]] killing a maiden-devouring serpent or [[Saint Columba]] lecturing the [[Loch Ness Monster]] which then stopped eating humans and became shy of human visitors.\n\nCarved stones depicting a seven-headed [[cobra]] are commonly found near the sluices of the ancient\nirrigation [[tank]]s in [[Sri Lanka]]; these are believed to have been placed as guardians of the water.\n\n==Wisdom==\nSnakes were associated with wisdom in many mythologies, perhaps due to the appearance of pondering their actions as they prepare to strike, which was copied by [[Medicine man|medicine men]] in the build-up to [[prophecy]] in parts of West Africa. Usually the wisdom of snakes was regarded as ancient and beneficial towards humans but sometimes it could be directed against humans. In [[East Asia]] snake-dragons watched over good harvests, rain, fertility and the cycle of the seasons, whilst in ancient Greece and India, snakes were considered to be lucky and snake-amulets were used as talismans against evil.\n\n[[Tiresias]] gained a dual male-female nature and an insight into the supernatural world when he killed  two snakes which were coupling in the woods.\n\nThe Biblical story of the [[fall of man]] tells of how Adam and Eve were deceived into disobeying God by a snake (identified as [[Satan]] by both [[Saint Paul|Paul]] and [[John the Apostle|John]] in II Corinthians and Revelation, respectively). In the story, the snake convinces Eve to eat fruit from the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]], which she then convinces Adam to do as well.  As a result, God banishes Adam and Eve from the garden and curses the snake.\n\nIn the state of Kerala, India, snake shrines occupy most households. Snakes were called upon by the creator of Kerala, Parasurama, to make the saline land fertile. The Mannarasala Shri [[Nagaraja Temple]] is one of the main centres of worship. The presiding deity here is [[Nagaraja]] - a five-headed snake god born to human parents as a blessing for their caretaking of snakes during a fire. It is believed that Nagaraja left his earthly life and took [[Samadhi]] but still resides in a chamber of the temple.\n\n==Healing==\nHealing and snakes were associated in ancient Greek myth with [[Aesculapius]], whose snake-familiars would crawl across the bodies of sick people asleep at night in his shrines and lick them back to health.\n\nIn northern Europe and West Asia, snakes were associated with healing whilst in parts of South Asia, snakes are regarded as possessing [[aphrodisiac]] qualities. Greek myth held that people could acquire second hearing and second sight if their ears or eyes were licked by a snake.\n\n==Snake gods==\n[[File:Ningizzida.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The \"libation vase of [[Gudea]]\" with the dragon [[Mushussu]], dedicated to [[Ningishzida]] (twentieth century BC [[short chronology]]).

Snakes were often also associated with immortality because they were observed biting their tails to form a circle and when they coiled they formed spirals. Both circles and spirals were seen as symbols of [[eternity]]. The circle was particularly important to [[Dahomey]]an myth where the snake-god Danh circled the world like a belt, corsetting it and preventing it from flying apart in splinters. In [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian myth]], the state of existence before creation was symbolised as [[Amduat]], a many-coiled serpent from which [[Ra]] the [[Sun]] and all of creation arose, returning each night and being reborn every morning. Also, the snake biting its tail ([[Ouroboros]]) symbolised the [[sea]] as the eternal ring which enclosed the world. In Egypt the snake has healing abilities. Hymns and offerings were made to it since it was believed that the Goddess could manifest through the snake. \n\"In a hymn to the goddess [[Meretseger|Mertseger]], a workman on the Necropolis of Thebes relates how the goddess came to him in the form of a snake to heal his illness (Bunn1967:617).''<ref>{{cite book|title=Snake and staff symbolism and healing|year=2005|pages=190|url=http://www.ajol.info/index.php/actat/article/viewFile/52573/41178.}}</ref> \n\nIn [[Serer creation myth|Serer cosmogony]] and [[Serer religion|religion]], the serpent is the symbol of the [[pangool]], the saints and ancestral spirits of the [[Serer people]] of [[West Africa]].

In [[Code of Hammurabi|Hammurabi\u2019s Law Code]] (c. 1700 BC) the god [[Ninazu]] is identified as the patron of healing, and his son, [[Ningishzida]], is depicted with a serpent and staff symbol (Bunn 1967:618)\n\n==Creation myths==\nSnakes were a common feature of many [[creation myth]]s, for example many people in [[california]] and [[Australia]] had myths about the [[Rainbow Serpent|Rainbow Snake]], which was either [[Mother goddess|Mother Earth]] herself giving birth to all animals or a water-god whose writhings created rivers, creeks and oceans. In [[History of India|ancient India]]n myth, the drought-serpent [[Ahi (Hinduism)|Ahi]] or [[Vritra]] swallowed the [[primordial ocean]] and did not release all created beings until [[Indra]] split the serpent's stomach with a [[thunderbolt]]. In another myth, the protector [[Vishnu]] slept on the coils of the world-serpent [[Shesha]] (or \"[[Shesha|Ananta]] the endless\";).

This symbol has many interpretations, one of which is the snake representing cyclical nature of life and death, life feeding on itself in the act of creation.\n\n==The underworld==\nSnakes were regularly regarded as guardians of the  [[Underworld]] or messengers between the Upper and Lower worlds because they lived in cracks and holes in the ground. The [[Gorgons]] of Greek myth were snake-women (a common hybrid) whose gaze would turn flesh into stone, the most famous of them being [[Medusa]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Medusa and Gorgons|url=http://www.theoi.com/Pontios/Gorgones.html}}</ref>  [[Naga (mythology)|Nagas]], \"the demon cobra\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Mallison|first=Fran\u00e7oise|title=Gin\u0101ns: Texts and Contexts : Essays on Ismaili Hymns from South Asia in honour of Zawahir  Moir|year=2007|publisher=Primus Books|location=Delhi|isbn=978-81-908918-7-5|pages=117,120|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=xmh3gQjPHkAC&pg=PA117 }}</ref> and naginis were human-headed snakes whose kings and queens who lived in jewel-encrusted underground or underwater paradises and who were perpetually at war with [[Garuda]] the Sun-bird.

He is almost always portrayed as a serpent or dragon depending on the particular myth. The underworld was part of a mythical world tree. The roots of this tree (usually growing in water) were guarded by [[Veles (god)|Veles]] (Volos) the serpent god.  \n\nThe idea of snake-people living below the Earth was prominent in [[American mythology|American myth]]. The [[Aztec]] underworld, [[Mictlan]] was protected by python-trees, a gigantic alligator and a snake, all of which spirits had to evade by physical ducking and weaving or cunning, before they could start the journey towards immortality. In [[North America]], the Brule [[Sioux]] people told of three brothers transformed into [[rattlesnake]]s which permanently helped and guided their human relatives.\n\nThe [[Pomo]] people told of a woman who married a rattlesnake-prince and gave birth to four snake-children who freely moved between the two worlds of their parents. The [[Hopi]] people told of a young man who ventured into the underworld and married a snake-princess. Amongst the [[Navajo people|Navajo]] people is a tale of Glispa, a girl returned with magical healing lore after spending two years with the Snake People by the Lake of Emergence in the underworld.<ref>{{cite book|last=Klah|first=Hasteen|title=Navajo Creation Myth: The Story of the Emergence|publisher=Museum of Navajo ceremonial art|year=1942|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.89349 }}</ref>\n\n==Water==\nSnakes were also commonly associated with water especially myths about the primordial ocean being formed of a huge coiled snake as in [[Ahi (Hinduism)|Ahi]]/[[Vritra]] in early Indian myth and [[Jormungand]] in [[Nordic mythology|Nordic myth]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Ashworth|first=Leon|title=Vikings and Northlands|year=2006|publisher=Evans Brothers Limited|isbn=9781842342701|url=https://books.google.com/books?&lr=&id=dWF0kHApmNIC&oi=fnd&pg=PA3}}</ref> Sea monsters lived in every ocean from the seven-headed crocodile-serpent [[Leviathan]] of [[Aggadah|Hebrew myth]] to the sea-god Koloowisi of the [[Zuni people]] of North America and the Greek monster [[Scylla]] with twelve snake-necks. In some cultures, eels (which spend their early lives in freshwater before returning to the sea as adults) were regarded as magical creatures.\n\nRivers and lakes often had snake-gods or snake-guardians including [[Untekhi]] the fearsome water-spirit of the [[Missouri River]]. Until recently, some northern European communities held [[well dressing]] ceremonies to appease the snake-spirits which lived in village wells and told legends of saints defeating malevolent lake-snakes e.g. [[Saint George]] killing a maiden-devouring serpent or [[Saint Columba]] lecturing the [[Loch Ness Monster]] which then stopped eating humans and became shy of human visitors.\n\nCarved stones depicting a seven-headed [[cobra]] are commonly found near the sluices of the ancient\nirrigation [[tank]]s in [[Sri Lanka]]; these are believed to have been placed as guardians of the water.\n\n==Wisdom==\nSnakes were associated with wisdom in many mythologies, perhaps due to the appearance of pondering their actions as they prepare to strike, which was copied by [[Medicine man|medicine men]] in the build-up to [[prophecy]] in parts of West Africa. Usually the wisdom of snakes was regarded as ancient and beneficial towards humans but sometimes it could be directed against humans. In [[East Asia]] snake-dragons watched over good harvests, rain, fertility and the cycle of the seasons, whilst in ancient Greece and India, snakes were considered to be lucky and snake-amulets were used as talismans against evil.\n\n[[Tiresias]] gained a dual male-female nature and an insight into the supernatural world when he killed  two snakes which were coupling in the woods.\n\nThe Biblical story of the [[fall of man]] tells of how Adam and Eve were deceived into disobeying God by a snake (identified as [[Satan]] by both [[Saint Paul|Paul]] and [[John the Apostle|John]] in II Corinthians and Revelation, respectively). In the story, the snake convinces Eve to eat fruit from the [[Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]], which she then convinces Adam to do as well.  As a result, God banishes Adam and Eve from the garden and curses the snake.\n\nIn the state of Kerala, India, snake shrines occupy most households. Snakes were called upon by the creator of Kerala, Parasurama, to make the saline land fertile. The Mannarasala Shri [[Nagaraja Temple]] is one of the main centres of worship. The presiding deity here is [[Nagaraja]] - a five-headed snake god born to human parents as a blessing for their caretaking of snakes during a fire. It is believed that Nagaraja left his earthly life and took [[Samadhi]] but still resides in a chamber of the temple.\n\n==Healing==\nHealing and snakes were associated in ancient Greek myth with [[Aesculapius]], whose snake-familiars would crawl across the bodies of sick people asleep at night in his shrines and lick them back to health.\n\nIn northern Europe and West Asia, snakes were associated with healing whilst in parts of South Asia, snakes are regarded as possessing [[aphrodisiac]] qualities. Greek myth held that people could acquire second hearing and second sight if their ears or eyes were licked by a snake.\n\n==Snake gods==\n[[File:Ningizzida.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The \"libation vase of [[Gudea]]\" with the dragon [[Mushussu]], dedicated to [[Ningishzida]] (twentieth century BC [[short chronology]]).

After dinner the guests adjourn to the music room, where one of the women, Blanca, plays a piano sonata. Later, when they might normally be expected to return home, the guests curiously remove their jackets, loosen their gowns, and settle down for the night on couches, chairs and the floor.\n\nBy morning it is apparent that, for some inexplicable reason, they are unable to leave. The guests consume what little drinks and food are left from the previous night's party. Days pass, and their plight intensifies; they become thirsty, hungry, quarrelsome, hostile, and hysterical. Only Dr. Carlos Conde, applying logic and reason, manages to keep his composure and guide the guests through the ordeal. One guest, the elderly Sergio Russell, dies, and his body is placed in a large cupboard. Later, B\u00e9atriz and Eduardo, a young engaged couple, lock themselves in a closet and commit suicide.\n\nThe guests eventually manage to break a wall open enough to access a water pipe. In the end, several sheep and a bear break loose from their bonds and find their way to the room; the guests take in the sheep and proceed to slaughter and roast them on fires made from floorboards and broken furniture. Dr. Conde tells N\u00f3bile that one of his patients, Leonora, is dying of [[cancer]] and accepts a secret supply of [[morphine]] from his host to keep her pain under control, but the supply is later stolen by siblings Francis and Juana. Ana, a Jew and a practitioner of Kabbalah, tries to free the guests by performing a mystical ceremony, which fails.\n\nEventually, Ra\u00fal suggests that N\u00f3bile is responsible for their predicament and that he must be sacrificed. Only Dr. Conde and the noble Colonel Alvaro oppose the angry mob claiming N\u00f3bile's blood. As N\u00f3bile offers to take his own life, a young foreign guest, Leticia (nicknamed \"[[valkyrie|La Valkiria]]\") notices that they are all seated in the same positions as when their plight began. Upon her encouragement, the group starts reconstructing their conversation and movements from the night of the party and discover that they are then free to leave the room. Outside the manor, the guests are greeted by the local police and the servants, who had left the house on the night of the party and who had similarly found themselves unable to enter it.\n\nTo give thanks for their salvation, the guests attend a ''[[Te Deum]]'' at the cathedral. When the service is over, the churchgoers along with the clergy are also trapped. It is not entirely clear whether those that were trapped in the house before are now trapped again. They seem to have disappeared. The situation in the church is followed by a riot on the streets and the military step in to brutally clamp down, firing on the rioters. The last scene shows a flock of sheep entering the church in single file, accompanied by the sound of gunshots.\n\n==Interpretations==\nThough Bu\u00f1uel never states what the symbolism represents, leaving it to the viewer's understanding, one critic, [[Roger Ebert]], wrote a lengthy interpretation of the film's symbolism, which includes the following paragraph: \"The dinner guests represent the ruling class in Franco's Spain.
