In the [[Middle Ages]], the town rose to national significance with the establishment of [[Northampton Castle]], an occasional royal residence which regularly hosted the [[Parliament of England]]. Medieval Northampton had many churches, monasteries and the [[University of Northampton (thirteenth century)|University of Northampton]], all enclosed by the town walls. It was granted a [[town charter]] by [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] in 1189 and a mayor was appointed by [[John of England|King John]] in 1215. The town was also the site of two medieval battles, in [[Battle of Northampton (1264)|1264]] and [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|1460]].\n\nNorthampton supported the Parliamentary [[Roundhead]]s in the [[English Civil War]], and [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] ordered the destruction of the town walls and most of the castle. The [[Great Fire of Northampton]] in 1675 destroyed much of the town. It was soon rebuilt and grew rapidly with the industrial development of the 18th century. Northampton continued to grow with the arrival of the [[Grand Union Canal]] and the railways in the 19th century, becoming a centre for footwear and leather manufacture.\n\nNorthampton's growth was limited until it was designated as a [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Town]] in 1968, accelerating development in the town.

A supplement, '''''With One Voice''''' ('''''WOV'''''), contains additional hymns and service music. The ''LBW'' is sometimes called the \"green book\", as opposed to ''With One Voice'', which is bound in blue; or ''[[Service Book and Hymnal]]'', which is bound in red; or ''[[The Lutheran Hymnal]]'', which is also bound in red, with a simple gold cross.\n\n== History ==\nWhen Lutheran churches were first established in North America, the immigrants from [[Germany]], [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], [[Finland]], and other non-English-speaking countries retained services in their native languages. However, as the children and grandchildren of these immigrants began speaking English in their everyday lives and the various Lutheran denominations began uniting, many felt that the North American Lutheran churches needed a common English-language [[liturgy]] and hymns. Although the eighteenth-century missionary [[Henry Melchior Muhlenberg]] had hoped for the day when Lutherans would be \"one church [with] one book\", it was not until the 1888 \"Common Service\" that a majority of English-speaking Lutherans in North America began to use the same texts for worship, albeit with minor adaptations. (Senn, 584-591.) The \"Common Liturgy\" included in the 1958 [[Service Book and Hymnal]] was a major revision of the \"Common Service\", and introduced a Eucharistic Prayer into American Lutheran usage. [[Culto Cristiano]], a 1964 service book, attempted to offer a unified liturgy for Spanish-speaking Lutherans.\n\nThe process leading to the publication of the ''LBW'' was started in 1965 when the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]] (LCMS) invited other North American Lutheran denominations to join it to work on a common service book. Together with the LCMS, the [[Lutheran Church in America]], the [[American Lutheran Church]], and the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada|Evangelical Lutheran Church of Canada]] formed the '''Inter-Lutheran Commission on Worship''' to undertake this project. The commission conducted its work through four sub-committees: Liturgical Text Committee, Liturgical Music Committee, Hymn Text Committee, Hymn Music Committee. The work of the committees was validated via provisional liturgical and hymn materials, questionnaires, conferences, and dialogs. The Rev. Dr. Eugene Brand was named project director for the development work and The Rev. Leonard Flachman was named publishers' representative and managing editor. The ''LBW'' was published in [[1978 in literature|1978]]. The LCMS pulled out of the ILCW just prior to the publication of the ''LBW'', but having been a participant in the development of the materials its name appears on the title page. The LCMS published its own hymnal, ''[[Lutheran Worship]]'' (LW), in 1982.  Although the ''LW'' liturgies are very similar to those in the ''LBW'', there are differences which reflect differing theologies. For example, ''LW'' lacks the option for a Eucharistic Prayer.\n\nThe ''Lutheran Book of Worship'' has remained in use for thirty years. There are a couple reasons for that longevity. The first is the careful, forward-looking, inclusive work of the ILCW and the four subcommittees. The second is the careful work done by the staff of [[Augsburg Fortress|Augsburg Publishing House]] in selecting and testing the materials with which the book was manufactured. The books did not wear out.\n\nThe first printing of the ''LBW'' was one million copies and required 19 semi-trailers to carry the book from the printer to 14 distribution points around the United States.\n\nWhile it is in its twenty-seventh printing and widely used by the ELCA and the ELCIC, the ''LBW'' was replaced in October 2006 as the primary worship resource in the two denominations by ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]]''. The new book is intended to reflect the changing demographic of the church bodies and the subsequent changes in language and ritual practice.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of English-language hymnals by denomination]]\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite book|title=Lutheran Book of Worship|last=|first=|publisher=Augsburg Publishing House and Lutheran Church in America Publication Board|year=1978|isbn=0-8006-3330-X|location=|pages=}}\n*{{Cite book|title=With One Voice|last=|first=|publisher=[[Augsburg Fortress]]|year=1995|isbn=0-8066-0051-9|location=|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/withonevoiceluth00evan}}\n*{{Cite book|title=Christian Liturgy: Catholic and Evangelical|last=Senn|first=Frank C.|publisher=Augsburg Fortress|year=1997|isbn=0-8006-2726-1|location=|pages=}}\n*{{Cite book|title=Encountering God: The Legacy of Lutheran Book of Worship|last=|first=|publisher=Kirk House Publishers|year=1998|isbn=1-886513-15-5|editor-last=Van Loon|editor-first=Ralph R.|location=|pages=}}\n*{{Cite book|title=In the Context of Unity: A History of the Development of Lutheran Book of Worship|last=Quere|first=Ralph W.|publisher=Lutheran University Press|year=2003|isbn=1-932688-00-5|location=|pages=}}\n\n{{Lutheran Divine Service}}\n{{Lutheran hymnody}}\n\n[[Category:Lutheran hymnals]]\n[[Category:1978 books]]\n[[Category:Christian prayer books]]\n[[Category:20th-century Christian texts]]\n[[Category:1978 in music]]\n[[Category:1978 in Christianity]]\n[[Category:Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]]\n[[Category:Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Worship book and hymnal used by several Lutheran denominations in North America}}\n{{italic title}}\n{{Infobox hymnal\n| name            = '''Lutheran Book of Worship'''\n| cover           = Lutheran Book of Worship.JPG\n| caption         = 1978 edition of the ''Lutheran Book of Worship''\n| commissioned_by =\n| approved_for    =\n| country         = United States\n| pages           =\n| publisher       = [[Augsburg Fortress]]\n| released        = 1978\n| number_of_hymns = 569\n| psalms          = 150\n| service_music   =\n| last_hymnal     = ''[[Service Book and Hymnal]]''\n| next_hymnal     = '''''With One Voice'''''\n}}\n{{Infobox hymnal\n| name            = '''With One Voice'''\n| cover           = With One Voice.JPG\n| caption         = 1995 edition of ''With One Voice''\n| commissioned_by =\n| approved_for    =\n| country         = United States\n| pages           =\n| publisher       = [[Augsburg Fortress]]\n| released        = 1995\n| number_of_hymns = \n| psalms          = \n| service_music   =\n| last_hymnal     = '''''Lutheran Book of Worship'''''\n| next_hymnal     = ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]]''\n}}\n\nThe '''''Lutheran Book of Worship''''' ('''''LBW''''') is a [[worship]] book and [[hymn]]al used by several [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[religious denomination|denominations]] in [[North America]].  A supplement, '''''With One Voice''''' ('''''WOV'''''), contains additional hymns and service music. The ''LBW'' is sometimes called the \"green book\", as opposed to ''With One Voice'', which is bound in blue; or ''[[Service Book and Hymnal]]'', which is bound in red; or ''[[The Lutheran Hymnal]]'', which is also bound in red, with a simple gold cross.\n\n== History ==\nWhen Lutheran churches were first established in North America, the immigrants from [[Germany]], [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], [[Finland]], and other non-English-speaking countries retained services in their native languages. However, as the children and grandchildren of these immigrants began speaking English in their everyday lives and the various Lutheran denominations began uniting, many felt that the North American Lutheran churches needed a common English-language [[liturgy]] and hymns. Although the eighteenth-century missionary [[Henry Melchior Muhlenberg]] had hoped for the day when Lutherans would be \"one church [with] one book\", it was not until the 1888 \"Common Service\" that a majority of English-speaking Lutherans in North America began to use the same texts for worship, albeit with minor adaptations. (Senn, 584-591.) The \"Common Liturgy\" included in the 1958 [[Service Book and Hymnal]] was a major revision of the \"Common Service\", and introduced a Eucharistic Prayer into American Lutheran usage. ''Culto Cristiano'', a 1964 service book, attempted to offer a unified liturgy for Spanish-speaking Lutherans.\n\nThe process leading to the publication of the ''LBW'' was started in 1965 when the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]] (LCMS) invited other North American Lutheran denominations to join it to work on a common service book.

They exhibit [[sexual dimorphism]]; females are about {{convert|2.5|mm|abbr=on|2}} long; males are slightly smaller with darker backs.

It is also unique among model organisms in that cleavage occurs in a [[syncytium]].\n[[File:Drosophila m oogenesis.png|left|thumb|''D. melanogaster'' [[oogenesis]]]]\nDuring oogenesis, cytoplasmic bridges called \"ring canals\" connect the forming oocyte to nurse cells. Nutrients and developmental control molecules move from the nurse cells into the oocyte. In the figure to the left, the forming oocyte can be seen to be covered by follicular support cells.\n\nAfter fertilization of the oocyte, the early embryo (or [[syncytium|syncytial embryo]]) undergoes rapid DNA replication and 13 nuclear divisions until about 5000 to 6000 nuclei accumulate in the unseparated cytoplasm of the embryo. By the end of the eighth division, most nuclei have migrated to the surface, surrounding the yolk sac (leaving behind only a few nuclei, which will become the yolk nuclei). After the 10th division, the pole cells form at the posterior end of the embryo, segregating the germ line from the syncytium. Finally, after the 13th division, cell membranes slowly invaginate, dividing the syncytium into individual somatic cells. Once this process is completed, [[gastrulation]] starts.<ref name=\"flymove\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Weigmann K, Klapper R, Strasser T, Rickert C, Technau G, J\u00e4ckle H, Janning W, Kl\u00e4mbt C | display-authors = 6 | title = FlyMove--a new way to look at development of Drosophila | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 310\u20131 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12801722 | doi = 10.1016/S0168-9525(03)00050-7 }}</ref>\n\nNuclear division in the early ''Drosophila'' embryo happens so quickly, no proper checkpoints exist, so mistakes may be made in division of the DNA. To get around this problem, the nuclei that have made a mistake detach from their [[centrosome]]s and fall into the centre of the embryo (yolk sac), which will not form part of the fly.\n\nThe gene network (transcriptional and protein interactions) governing the early development of the fruit fly embryo is one of the best understood gene networks to date, especially the patterning along the anteroposterior (AP) and dorsoventral (DV) axes (See under [[Morphogenesis#Anterior-posterior axis patterning in Drosophila|morphogenesis]]).<ref name=\"flymove\"/>\n\nThe embryo undergoes well-characterized [[morphogenesis|morphogenetic]] movements during gastrulation and early development, including germ-band extension, formation of several furrows, ventral invagination of the mesoderm, and posterior and anterior invagination of endoderm (gut), as well as extensive body segmentation until finally hatching from the surrounding cuticle into a first-instar larva.\n\nDuring larval development, tissues known as [[imaginal disc]]s grow inside the larva. Imaginal discs develop to form most structures of the adult body, such as the head, legs, wings, thorax, and genitalia. Cells of the imaginal disks are set aside during embryogenesis and continue to grow and divide during the larval stages\u2014unlike most other cells of the larva, which have differentiated to perform specialized functions and grow without further cell division. At metamorphosis, the larva forms a [[pupa]], inside which the larval tissues are reabsorbed and the imaginal tissues undergo extensive morphogenetic movements to form adult structures.\n\n=== Developmental plasticity ===\nAs in most insects,<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Abram PK, Boivin G, Moiroux J, Brodeur J | title = Behavioural effects of temperature on ectothermic animals: unifying thermal physiology and behavioural plasticity | journal = Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society | volume = 92 | issue = 4 | pages = 1859\u20131876 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 28980433 | doi = 10.1111/brv.12312 }}</ref> environmental factors such as temperature can influence development in ''Drosophila melanogaster''.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gibert P, Huey RB, Gilchrist GW | title = Locomotor performance of Drosophila melanogaster: interactions among developmental and adult temperatures, age, and geography | journal = Evolution; International Journal of Organic Evolution | volume = 55 | issue = 1 | pages = 205\u20139 | date = January 2001 | pmid = 11263741 | doi = 10.1111/j.0014-3820.2001.tb01286.x }}</ref><ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Zamudio|first=Kelly R.|last2=Huey|first2=Raymond B.|last3=Crill|first3=Wayne D. | name-list-format = vanc |date=1995|title=Bigger isn't always better: body size, developmental and parental temperature and male territorial success in Drosophila melanogaster |journal=Animal Behaviour|language=en|volume=49|issue=3|pages=671\u2013677|doi=10.1016/0003-3472(95)80200-2|issn=0003-3472}}</ref> For example, temperature can lead to [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] variation, such as larger or smaller body sizes, via [[developmental plasticity]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = West-Eberhard MJ | title = Developmental plasticity and the origin of species differences | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 Suppl 1 | issue = suppl 1 | pages = 6543\u20139 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15851679 | pmc = 1131862 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0501844102 | bibcode = 2005PNAS..102.6543W }}</ref> Temperature-induced developmental plasticity can be beneficial and/or detrimental.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Crill|first=Wayne D.|last2=Huey|first2=Raymond B.|last3=Gilchrist|first3=George W.|date=1996|title=Within- and Between-Generation Effects of Temperature on the Morphology and Physiology of Drosophila melanogaster|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2410661|journal=Evolution|volume=50|issue=3|pages=1205\u20131218|doi=10.2307/2410661|issn=0014-3820}}</ref><ref name=\":9\">{{Cite journal|last=David|first=J.

These are ''sex-lethal, sisterless'', and ''deadpan''. Deadpan is an autosomal gene which inhibits ''sex-lethal'', while ''sisterless'' is carried on the X chromosome and inhibits the action of ''deadpan''. An AAX cell has twice as much ''deadpan'' as ''sisterless'', so ''sex-lethal'' will be inhibited, creating a male. However, an AAXX cell will produce enough ''sisterless'' to inhibit the action of ''deadpan'', allowing the ''sex-lethal'' gene to be transcribed to create a female.\n\nLater, control by ''deadpan'' and ''sisterless'' disappears and what becomes important is the form of the ''sex-lethal'' gene.

The ''D. melanogaster'' immune system can be divided into two responses: humoral and cell-mediated. The former is a systemic response mediated through the ''[[Toll (gene)|Toll]]'' and [[Imd pathway|''Imd'']] pathways, which are parallel systems for detecting microbes. The ''Toll'' pathway in ''Drosophila'' is known as the homologue of ''Toll-like'' pathways in mammals. Spatzle, a known ligand for the ''Toll'' pathway in flies, is produced in response to [[Gram-positive bacteria]], parasites, and fungal infection. Upon infection, pro-Spatzle will be cleaved by the protease SPE (Spatzle processing enzyme) to become active Spatzle, which then binds to the ''Toll'' receptor located on the cell surface (Fat body, hemocytes) and dimerizes for activation of downstream [[NF-\u03baB]] signaling pathways. It has been proposed that a second SPE-like enzyme similarly acts to activate Spatzle, as loss of SPE does not completely reduce the activity of Toll signalling.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamamoto-Hino M, Goto S | title = Sp\u00e4tzle-Processing Enzyme-independent Activation of the Toll Pathway in Drosophila Innate Immunity | journal = Cell Structure and Function | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 55\u201360 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 26843333 | doi = 10.1247/csf.16002 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name=\"Dudzic2019\"/> The [[Imd pathway]] is instead triggered by [[Gram-negative bacteria]] through soluble and surface receptors (PGRP-LE and LC, respectively). ''D. melanogaster'' has a [[fat body]], which is [[Homology (biology)#Homology vs analogy|analogous]] to the human liver. It is the primary secretory organ and produces [[antimicrobial peptides]]. These peptides are secreted into the [[hemolymph]] and bind infectious bacteria, killing them by forming pores in their [[cell wall]]s. Other than the fat body, hemocytes, the blood cells in ''Drosophila'', are analogous to mammalian monocyte/macrophages, possessing a significant role in mediating immune responses.\n\nIt is known from the literature that in response to immune challenge, hemocytes are able to secrete cytokines, for example Spatzle, to activate downstream signaling pathways in the fat body. However, the mechanism still remains unclear. The response to infection can involve up to 2,423 genes, or 13.7% of the genome. Although the fly's transcriptional response to microbial challenge is highly specific to individual pathogens, ''Drosophila'' differentially expresses a core group of 252 genes upon infection with most bacteria. This core group of genes is associated with gene ontology categories such as antimicrobial response, stress response, secretion, neuron-like, reproduction, and metabolism among others.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Troha K, Im JH, Revah J, Lazzaro BP, Buchon N | title = Comparative transcriptomics reveals CrebA as a novel regulator of infection tolerance in D. melanogaster | journal = PLoS Pathogens | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = e1006847 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 29394281 | pmc = 5812652 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006847 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=De Gregorio |first1=E |last2=Spellman |first2=PT |last3=Tzou |first3=P |last4=Rubin |first4=GM |last5=Lemaitre |first5=B |title=The Toll and Imd pathways are the major regulators of the immune response in Drosophila |journal=EMBO |date=2002 |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=2568\u20132579 |doi=10.1093/emboj/21.11.2568 |pmid=12032070|pmc=126042 }}</ref> ''Drosophila'' also possesses several immune mechanisms to both shape the microbiota and prevent excessive immune responses upon detection of microbial stimuli.

These changes include increased selectivity for courting only intraspecifically, as well as decreased [[courtship]] times.\n\nSexually na\u00efve ''D. melanogaster'' males are known to spend significant time courting interspecifically, such as with ''D. simulans'' flies.

''D. melanogaster'' males show little to no preference for ''D. melanogaster'' females over females of other species or even other male flies. However, after ''D. simulans'' or other flies incapable of copulation have rejected the males\u2019 advances, ''D. melanogaster'' males are much less likely to spend time courting nonspecifically in the future.

It is also unique among model organisms in that cleavage occurs in a [[syncytium]].\n[[File:Drosophila m oogenesis.png|left|thumb|''D. melanogaster'' [[oogenesis]]]]\nDuring oogenesis, cytoplasmic bridges called \"ring canals\" connect the forming oocyte to nurse cells. Nutrients and developmental control molecules move from the nurse cells into the oocyte. In the figure to the left, the forming oocyte can be seen to be covered by follicular support cells.\n\nAfter fertilization of the oocyte, the early embryo (or [[syncytium|syncytial embryo]]) undergoes rapid DNA replication and 13 nuclear divisions until about 5000 to 6000 nuclei accumulate in the unseparated cytoplasm of the embryo. By the end of the eighth division, most nuclei have migrated to the surface, surrounding the yolk sac (leaving behind only a few nuclei, which will become the yolk nuclei). After the 10th division, the pole cells form at the posterior end of the embryo, segregating the germ line from the syncytium. Finally, after the 13th division, cell membranes slowly invaginate, dividing the syncytium into individual somatic cells. Once this process is completed, [[gastrulation]] starts.<ref name=\"flymove\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Weigmann K, Klapper R, Strasser T, Rickert C, Technau G, J\u00e4ckle H, Janning W, Kl\u00e4mbt C | display-authors = 6 | title = FlyMove--a new way to look at development of Drosophila | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 310\u20131 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12801722 | doi = 10.1016/S0168-9525(03)00050-7 }}</ref>\n\nNuclear division in the early ''Drosophila'' embryo happens so quickly, no proper checkpoints exist, so mistakes may be made in division of the DNA. To get around this problem, the nuclei that have made a mistake detach from their [[centrosome]]s and fall into the centre of the embryo (yolk sac), which will not form part of the fly.\n\nThe gene network (transcriptional and protein interactions) governing the early development of the fruit fly embryo is one of the best understood gene networks to date, especially the patterning along the anteroposterior (AP) and dorsoventral (DV) axes (See under [[Morphogenesis#Anterior-posterior axis patterning in Drosophila|morphogenesis]]).<ref name=\"flymove\"/>\n\nThe embryo undergoes well-characterized [[morphogenesis|morphogenetic]] movements during gastrulation and early development, including germ-band extension, formation of several furrows, ventral invagination of the mesoderm, and posterior and anterior invagination of endoderm (gut), as well as extensive body segmentation until finally hatching from the surrounding cuticle into a first-instar larva.\n\nDuring larval development, tissues known as [[imaginal disc]]s grow inside the larva. Imaginal discs develop to form most structures of the adult body, such as the head, legs, wings, thorax, and genitalia. Cells of the imaginal disks are set aside during embryogenesis and continue to grow and divide during the larval stages\u2014unlike most other cells of the larva, which have differentiated to perform specialized functions and grow without further cell division. At metamorphosis, the larva forms a [[pupa]], inside which the larval tissues are reabsorbed and the imaginal tissues undergo extensive morphogenetic movements to form adult structures.\n\n=== Developmental plasticity ===\nAs in most insects,<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Abram PK, Boivin G, Moiroux J, Brodeur J | title = Behavioural effects of temperature on ectothermic animals: unifying thermal physiology and behavioural plasticity | journal = Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society | volume = 92 | issue = 4 | pages = 1859\u20131876 | date = November 2017 | pmid = 28980433 | doi = 10.1111/brv.12312 }}</ref> environmental factors such as temperature can influence development in ''Drosophila melanogaster''.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gibert P, Huey RB, Gilchrist GW | title = Locomotor performance of Drosophila melanogaster: interactions among developmental and adult temperatures, age, and geography | journal = Evolution; International Journal of Organic Evolution | volume = 55 | issue = 1 | pages = 205\u20139 | date = January 2001 | pmid = 11263741 | doi = 10.1111/j.0014-3820.2001.tb01286.x }}</ref><ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Zamudio|first=Kelly R.|last2=Huey|first2=Raymond B.|last3=Crill|first3=Wayne D. | name-list-format = vanc |date=1995|title=Bigger isn't always better: body size, developmental and parental temperature and male territorial success in Drosophila melanogaster |journal=Animal Behaviour|language=en|volume=49|issue=3|pages=671\u2013677|doi=10.1016/0003-3472(95)80200-2|issn=0003-3472}}</ref> For example, temperature can lead to [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] variation, such as larger or smaller body sizes, via [[developmental plasticity]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = West-Eberhard MJ | title = Developmental plasticity and the origin of species differences | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 Suppl 1 | issue = suppl 1 | pages = 6543\u20139 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15851679 | pmc = 1131862 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0501844102 | bibcode = 2005PNAS..102.6543W }}</ref> Temperature-induced developmental plasticity can be beneficial and/or detrimental.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Crill|first=Wayne D.|last2=Huey|first2=Raymond B.|last3=Gilchrist|first3=George W.|date=1996|title=Within- and Between-Generation Effects of Temperature on the Morphology and Physiology of Drosophila melanogaster|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2410661|journal=Evolution|volume=50|issue=3|pages=1205\u20131218|doi=10.2307/2410661|issn=0014-3820}}</ref><ref name=\":9\">{{Cite journal|last=David|first=J.

These are ''sex-lethal, sisterless'', and ''deadpan''. Deadpan is an autosomal gene which inhibits ''sex-lethal'', while ''sisterless'' is carried on the X chromosome and inhibits the action of ''deadpan''. An AAX cell has twice as much ''deadpan'' as ''sisterless'', so ''sex-lethal'' will be inhibited, creating a male. However, an AAXX cell will produce enough ''sisterless'' to inhibit the action of ''deadpan'', allowing the ''sex-lethal'' gene to be transcribed to create a female.\n\nLater, control by ''deadpan'' and ''sisterless'' disappears and what becomes important is the form of the ''sex-lethal'' gene. A secondary promoter causes transcription in both males and females. Analysis of the [[cDNA]] has shown that different forms are expressed in males and females. ''Sex-lethal'' has been shown to affect the [[RNA splicing|splicing]] of its own [[mRNA]]. In males, the third [[exon]] is included which encodes a [[stop codon]], causing a truncated form to be produced. In the female version, the presence of ''sex-lethal'' causes this exon to be missed out; the other seven [[amino acids]] are produced as a full [[peptide]] chain, again giving a difference between males and females.<ref name=Sin_2000>{{cite book | vauthors = Gilbert SF | title = Developmental Biology | url = https://archive.org/details/developmentalbio00gilb | url-access = registration | edition = 6th | location = Sunderland (MA) | publisher = Sinauer Associates; 2000 |year=2000 }}</ref>\n\nPresence or absence of functional sex-lethal proteins now go on to affect the transcription of another protein known as doublesex. In the absence of sex-lethal, doublesex will have the fourth exon removed and be translated up to and including exon 6 (DSX-M[ale]), while in its presence the fourth exon which encodes a stop codon will produce a truncated version of the protein (DSX-F[emale]).

The ''D. melanogaster'' immune system can be divided into two responses: humoral and cell-mediated. The former is a systemic response mediated through the ''[[Toll (gene)|Toll]]'' and [[Imd pathway|''Imd'']] pathways, which are parallel systems for detecting microbes. The ''Toll'' pathway in ''Drosophila'' is known as the homologue of ''Toll-like'' pathways in mammals. Spatzle, a known ligand for the ''Toll'' pathway in flies, is produced in response to [[Gram-positive bacteria]], parasites, and fungal infection. Upon infection, pro-Spatzle will be cleaved by the protease SPE (Spatzle processing enzyme) to become active Spatzle, which then binds to the ''Toll'' receptor located on the cell surface (Fat body, hemocytes) and dimerizes for activation of downstream [[NF-\u03baB]] signaling pathways.

These peptides are secreted into the [[hemolymph]] and bind infectious bacteria, killing them by forming pores in their [[cell wall]]s.

However, the mechanism still remains unclear. The response to infection can involve up to 2,423 genes, or 13.7% of the genome. Although the fly's transcriptional response to microbial challenge is highly specific to individual pathogens, ''Drosophila'' differentially expresses a core group of 252 genes upon infection with most bacteria.

They put into effect the terms of the [[Treaty of Union]] that had been agreed on 22 July 1706, following negotiation between commissioners representing the parliaments of the two countries. By the two Acts, the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]]{{mdash}}which at the time were separate [[sovereign state|states]] with separate legislatures, but [[Personal union|with the same monarch]]{{mdash}}were, in the words of the Treaty, \"United into One Kingdom by the Name of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]\".<ref>Article I of the Treaty of Union</ref>\n\nThe two countries had shared a monarch since the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603, when [[King James VI of Scotland]] inherited the English throne from his [[double first cousin]] twice removed, [[Queen Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]. Although described as a Union of Crowns, until 1707 there were in fact two separate Crowns resting on the same head (as opposed to the implied creation of a single Crown and a single Kingdom, exemplified by the later [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]). Prior to the Acts of Union there had been three previous attempts (in 1606, 1667, and 1689) to unite the two countries by Acts of Parliament, but it was not until the early 18th century that both political establishments came to support the idea, albeit for different reasons.\n\nThe Acts took effect on 1 May 1707. On this date, the Scottish Parliament and the English Parliament united to form the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], based in the [[Palace of Westminster]] in London, the home of the English Parliament.<ref>[[s:Act of Union 1707|Act of Union 1707]], Article 3</ref> Hence, the Acts are referred to as the '''Union of the Parliaments'''. On the Union, the historian [[Simon Schama]] said \"What began as a hostile merger, would end in a full partnership in the most powerful going concern in the world ... it was one of the most astonishing transformations in European history.\"<ref>{{cite episode |title=Britannia Incorporated|series= A History of Britain |serieslink= Simon Schama's A History of Britain |credits= [[Simon Schama]] (presenter) |network= [[BBC One]] |airdate= 22 May 2001 |number=10 |minutes=3}}</ref>\n\n==Political Background prior to 1707==\n===1603\u20131660===\nPrior to 1603, England and Scotland were separate kingdoms; as [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] never married, after  1567, her heir became the Stuart king of Scotland, [[James VI and I|James VI]], who was brought up as a Protestant. After her death, the two Crowns were held in personal union by James, as James I of England, and James VI of Scotland. He announced his intention to unite the two, using the [[royal prerogative in the United Kingdom|royal prerogative]] to take the title \"King of Great Britain\", {{sfn|Larkin, Hughes|1973|page=19}} and give a British character to his court and person.{{sfn|Lockyer|1998|pp=51\u201352}}\n[[File:The Signing of the National Covenant in Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Scottish opposition to Stuart attempts to impose religious union led to the 1638 National Covenant]]\nThe 1603 [[Union of England and Scotland Act 1603|Union of England and Scotland Act]] established a joint Commission to agree terms, but the [[English Parliament]] was concerned this would lead to the imposition of an [[absolute monarchy|absolutist]] structure similar to that of Scotland. James was forced to withdraw his proposals, and attempts to revive it in 1610 were met with hostility.{{sfn|Lockyer|1998|pp=54\u201359}}\n\nInstead, he set about creating a unified Church of Scotland and England, as the first step towards a centralised, Unionist state.{{sfn|Stephen|2010|pp=55\u201358}} However, despite both being nominally [[Episcopal_polity|Episcopalian]] in structure, the two were very different in doctrine; the [[Church of Scotland]], or kirk, was [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] in doctrine, and viewed many [[Church of England]] practices as little better than Catholicism.{{sfn|McDonald|1998|pp=75\u201376}} As a result, attempts to impose religious policy by James and his son [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] ultimately led to the 1639\u20131651 [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]].\n\nThe 1639\u20131640 [[Bishops' Wars]] confirmed the primacy of the kirk, and established a [[Covenanter]] government in Scotland. The Scots remained neutral when the [[First English Civil War]] began in 1642, before becoming concerned at the impact on Scotland of a Royalist victory.{{sfn|Kaplan|1970|pp=50\u201370}} Presbyterian leaders like [[Archibald_Campbell,_1st_Marquess_of_Argyll|Argyll]] viewed union as a way to ensure free trade between England and Scotland, and preserve a Presbyterian kirk.{{sfn|Robertson|2014|p=125}}\n[[File:The Solemn League And Covenant.jpg|thumb|right|The 1643 [[Solemn League and Covenant]] between England and Scotland]]\nUnder the 1643 [[Solemn League and Covenant]], the Covenanters agreed to provide military support for the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]], in return for religious union. Although the treaty referred repeatedly to 'union' between England, Scotland, and Ireland, political union had little support outside the Kirk Party. Even religious union was opposed by the Episcopalian majority in the Church of England, and [[Independent (religion)|Independents]] like [[Oliver Cromwell]], who dominated the [[New Model Army]].\n\nThe Scots and English Presbyterians were political conservatives, who increasingly viewed the Independents, and associated radical groups like the [[Levellers]], as a bigger threat than the Royalists. Both Royalists and Presbyterians agreed monarchy was divinely ordered, but disagreed on the nature and extent of Royal authority over the church. When Charles I surrendered in 1646, they allied with their former enemies to restore him to the English throne.{{sfn|Harris|2015|pp=53\u201354}}\n\nAfter defeat in the 1647\u20131648 [[Second English Civil War]], Scotland was occupied by English troops which were withdrawn once the so-called [[Engagers]] whom Cromwell held responsible for the war had been replaced by the Kirk Party. In December 1648, [[Pride's Purge]] confirmed Cromwell's political control in England by removing Presbyterian MPs from Parliament, and executing Charles in January 1649. Seeing this as sacrilege, the Kirk Party proclaimed [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] King of Scotland and Great Britain, and agreed to restore him to the English throne.\n\nDefeat in the 1649\u20131651 [[Third English Civil War|Third English Civil War or Anglo-Scottish War]] resulted in Scotland's incorporation into the [[Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland]], largely driven by Cromwell's determination to break the power of the kirk, which he held responsible for the Anglo-Scottish War.{{sfn|Morrill|1990|p=162}} The 1652 [[Tender of Union]] was followed on 12 April 1654 by ''An Ordinance by the Protector for the Union of England and Scotland,'' creating the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland]].<ref>[http://www.constitution.org/eng/conpur098.htm Constitution.org]</ref> It was ratified by the [[Second Protectorate Parliament]] on 26 June 1657, creating a single Parliament in Westminster, with 30 representatives each from Scotland and Ireland added to the existing English members.<ref>The 1657 Act's long title was ''An Act and Declaration touching several Acts and Ordinances made since 20 April 1653, and before 3 September 1654, and other Acts''</ref>\n\n===1660\u20131707===\n[[File:Cromwell at Dunbar Andrew Carrick Gow.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Battle of Dunbar (1650)]]; Scotland was incorporated into the Commonwealth after defeat in the 1650\u20131651 Anglo-Scots War.]]\nWhile integration into the Commonwealth established free trade between Scotland and England, the economic benefits were diminished by the costs of military occupation.<ref name=\"parliament.uk\">[http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/tk_02_cromwell.html Parliament.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012160340/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/tk_02_cromwell.html |date=12 October 2008 }}</ref> Both Scotland and England associated union with heavy taxes and military rule; it had little popular support in either country, and was dissolved after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of Charles II in 1660.\n\nThe Scottish economy was badly damaged by the English [[Navigation Acts]] of 1660 and 1663 and wars with the Dutch Republic, its major export market. An Anglo-Scots Trade Commission was set up in January 1668 but the English had no interest in making concessions, as the Scots had little to offer in return. In 1669, Charles II revived talks on political union; his motives were to weaken Scotland's commercial and political links with the Dutch, still seen as an enemy and complete the work of his grandfather James I.{{sfn|MacIntosh|2007|pp=79\u201387}} Continued opposition meant these negotiations were abandoned by the end of 1669.{{sfn|Whatley|2001|p=95}}\n\nFollowing the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, a [[Convention of the Estates of Scotland|Scottish Convention]] met in Edinburgh in April 1689 to agree a new constitutional settlement; during which the Scottish Bishops backed a proposed union in an attempt to preserve Episcopalian control of the kirk. [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]] were supportive of the idea but it was opposed both by the Presbyterian majority in Scotland and the English Parliament.{{sfn|Lynch|1992|p=305}} Episcopacy in Scotland was abolished in 1690, alienating a significant part of the political class; it was this element that later formed the bedrock of opposition to Union.{{sfn|Harris|2007|pp=404\u2013406}}\n\nThe 1690s were a time of economic hardship in Europe as a whole and Scotland in particular, a period now known as the [[Seven ill years]] which led to strained relations with England.{{sfn|Whatley|2006|p=91}} In 1698, the [[Company of Scotland|Company of Scotland Trading to Africa and the Indies]] received a charter to raise capital through public subscription.{{sfn|Mitchison|2002|pp=301\u2013302}} The Company invested in the [[Dari\u00e9n scheme]], an ambitious plan funded almost entirely by Scottish investors to build a colony on the [[Isthmus of Panama]] for trade with East Asia.{{sfn|Richards|2004|p=79}} The scheme was a disaster; the losses of over \u00a3150,000 severely impacted the Scottish commercial system.{{sfn|Mitchison|2002|p=314}} \n\n==Political motivations==\n[[File:QueenAnne1702.jpg|thumb|160px||right|Queen Anne in 1702]]\nThe Acts of Union should be seen within a wider European context of increasing state centralisation during the late 17th and early 18th centuries, including the monarchies of France, Sweden, Denmark and Spain. While there were exceptions, such as the [[Dutch Republic]] or the [[Republic of Venice]], the trend was clear.{{sfn|Munck|2005|pp=429\u2013431}}\n\nThe dangers of the monarch using one Parliament against the other first became apparent in 1647 and 1651. It resurfaced during the 1679 to 1681 [[Exclusion Crisis]], caused by English resistance to the Catholic [[James II of England|James]] succeeding his brother Charles. James was sent to Edinburgh in 1681 as [[Lord High Commissioner to the Parliament of Scotland|Lord High Commissioner]]; in August, the Scottish Parliament passed the Succession Act, confirming the divine right of kings, the rights of the natural heir 'regardless of religion,' the duty of all to swear allegiance to that king and the independence of the Scottish Crown. It then went beyond ensuring James's succession to the Scottish throne by explicitly stating the aim was to make his exclusion from the English throne impossible without '...the fatall and dreadfull consequences of a civil war.'{{sfn|Jackson|2003|pp=38\u201354}}\n\nThe issue reappeared during the 1688 [[Glorious Revolution]]. The English Parliament generally supported replacing James with his Protestant daughter [[Mary II]], but resisted making her Dutch husband [[William III & II]] joint ruler. They gave way only when he threatened to return to the Netherlands, and Mary refused to rule without him.{{sfn|Horwitz|1986|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nIn Scotland, conflict over control of the kirk between Presbyterians and Episcopalians and William's position as a fellow Calvinist put him in a much stronger position. He originally insisted on retaining Episcopacy, and the Committee of the Articles, an unelected body that controlled what legislation Parliament could debate. Both would have given the Crown far greater control than in England but he withdrew his demands due to the 1689\u20131692 Jacobite Rising.{{sfn|Lynch|1992|pp=300\u2013303}}\n\n=== English perspective ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\nThe English purpose was to ensure that Scotland would not choose a monarch different from the one on the English throne. The two countries had shared a king for much of the previous century, but the English were concerned that an independent Scotland with a different king, even if he were a Protestant, might make alliances against England. The English succession was provided for by the English [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which ensured that the monarch of England would be a Protestant member of the [[House of Hanover]]. Until the Union of Parliaments, the Scottish throne might be inherited by a different successor after [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]: the Scottish [[Act of Security 1704]] granted parliament the right to choose a successor and explicitly required a choice different from the English monarch unless the English were to grant free trade and navigation.\n\n=== Scottish perspective ===\nThe Scottish economy was severely impacted by [[privateers]] during the 1688 to 1697 [[Nine Years War]], and the 1701 [[War of the Spanish Succession]], with the [[Royal Navy]] focusing on protecting English ships. This compounded the economic pressure caused by the [[Darien scheme]], and the [[Seven_ill_years|Seven ill years]] of the 1690s, when between 5\u201315% of the population died of starvation.{{sfn|Cullen|2010|p=117}} The Scottish Parliament was promised financial assistance, protection for its maritime trade, and an end of economic restrictions on trade with England.{{sfn|Whatley|2001|p=48}}\n\nThe votes of the Court party, combined with the majority of the [[Squadrone Volante (Scotland)|Squadrone Volante]], were sufficient to ensure passage of the treaty. Article 15 granted [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]398,085 10[[Shilling|s]] sterling to Scotland, a sum known as [[The Equivalent]], to offset future liability towards the English national debt. This was used to compensate investors in the Darien scheme, with 58.6% of the fund allocated to its shareholders and creditors.{{sfn|Watt|2007|p=?}}\n[[File:Downsitting of the Scottish Parliament detail.JPG|thumb|left|18th-century French illustration of an opening of the Scottish Parliament]]\nThe role played by bribery has long been debated; \u00a320,000 was distributed by the [[Earl of Glasgow]], of which 60% went to [[James Douglas, 2nd Duke of Queensberry]], the [[Queen's Commissioner in Parliament]]. [[Robert Burns]] is commonly quoted in support; \"We're bought and sold for English Gold, Such a Parcel of Rogues in a Nation.\" As historian [[Christopher Whatley]] points out, this was actually a 17th century Scots folk song; he agrees money was paid, but suggests the economic benefits were supported by most Scots MPs, however reluctantly.{{sfn|Whatley |1989|pp=160\u2013165}}   \n\n[[George Lockhart (politician)|Sir George Lockhart of Carnwath]], the only Scottish negotiator to oppose Union, noted \"the whole nation appears against (it)\". Another negotiator, Sir John Clerk of Penicuik, who was an ardent Unionist, observed it was \"contrary to the inclinations of at least three-fourths of the Kingdom\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/devolution/scotland/briefing/1707.shtml |title=Scottish Referendums |publisher=BBC |accessdate=16 March 2016}}</ref> As the seat of the Scottish Parliament, demonstrators in Edinburgh feared the impact of its loss on the local economy.

Under the aegis of the Queen and her ministers in both kingdoms, the parliaments of England and Scotland agreed to participate in fresh negotiations for a union treaty in 1705.\n\nBoth countries appointed 31 commissioners to conduct the negotiations. Most of the Scottish commissioners favoured union, and about half were government ministers and other officials. At the head of the list was Queensberry, and the [[Lord Chancellor of Scotland]], the [[Earl of Seafield]].<ref name=\"commissioners\">{{cite web | url = http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/04_01_commissioners.html | title = The commissioners | publisher = UK Parliament website | year = 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090619224021/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/04_01_commissioners.html | archivedate = 19 June 2009 | accessdate = 5 February 2013}}</ref> The English commissioners included the [[Lord High Treasurer]], the [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Earl of Godolphin]], the [[Lord Keeper of the Great Seal|Lord Keeper]], [[William Cowper, 1st Earl Cowper|Baron Cowper]], and a large number of Whigs who supported union. Tories were not in favour of union and only one was represented among the commissioners.<ref name=\"commissioners\"/>\n\nNegotiations between the English and Scottish commissioners took place between 16 April and 22 July 1706 at the [[Cockpit-in-Court|Cockpit]] in London. Each side had its own particular concerns. Within a few days, England gained a guarantee that the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] dynasty would succeed Queen Anne to the Scottish crown, and Scotland received a guarantee of access to colonial markets, in the hope that they would be placed on an equal footing in terms of trade.<ref name=\"negotiations\">{{cite web | url = http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/04_02_course.html | title = The course of negotiations | publisher = UK Parliament website | year = 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090721014514/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/04_02_course.html | archivedate = 21 July 2009 | accessdate = 5 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter negotiations ended in July 1706, the acts had to be ratified by both Parliaments. In Scotland, about 100 of the 227 members of the [[Parliament of Scotland]] were supportive of the [[Court Party]]. For extra votes the pro-court side could rely on about 25 members of the [[Squadrone Volante (Scotland)|Squadrone Volante]], led by the [[James Graham, 1st Duke of Montrose|Marquess of Montrose]] and the [[Duke of Roxburghe]]. Opponents of the court were generally known as the [[Country Party (Britain)|Country party]], and included various factions and individuals such as the [[Duke of Hamilton]], [[Lord Belhaven]] and [[Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun]], who spoke forcefully and passionately against the union. The Court party enjoyed significant funding from England and the Treasury and included many who had accumulated debts following the [[Darien Disaster]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/05_ratification.html | title = Ratification | publisher = UK parliament website | year = 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090619224031/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/05_ratification.html | archivedate = 19 June 2009 | accessdate = 5 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn Scotland, the [[James Douglas, 2nd Duke of Queensberry|Duke of Queensberry]] was largely responsible for the successful passage of the Union act by the [[Scottish Parliament]]. In Scotland, he received much criticism from local residents, but in England he was cheered for his action. He had received around half of the funding awarded by the Westminster treasury for himself. In April 1707, he travelled to London to attend celebrations at the royal court, and was greeted by groups of noblemen and gentry lined along the road. From [[Chipping Barnet|Barnet]], the route was lined with crowds of cheering people, and once he reached London a huge crowd had formed. On 17 April, the Duke was gratefully received by the Queen at [[Kensington Palace]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/08_union.html | title = 1 May 1707 \u2013 the Union comes into effect | publisher = UK Parliament website | year = 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090619224036/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/08_union.html | archivedate = 19 June 2009 | accessdate = 5 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Provisions==\n[[File:Floral Badge of Great Britain.svg|thumb|upright|right|[[Royal Badges of England|Heraldic badge]] of Queen Anne, depicting the [[Tudor rose]] and the [[Scottish thistle]] growing from the same stem.]]\n{{Main|Treaty of Union}}\nThe [[Treaty of Union]], agreed between representatives of the [[Parliament of England]] and the [[Parliament of Scotland]] in 1706, consisted of 25 articles, 15 of which were economic in nature. In Scotland, each article was voted on separately and several clauses in articles were delegated to specialised subcommittees. Article 1 of the treaty was based on the political principle of an incorporating union and this was secured by a majority of 116 votes to 83 on 4 November 1706. To minimise the opposition of the [[Church of Scotland]], an Act was also passed to secure the [[Presbyterian]] establishment of the Church, after which the Church stopped its open opposition, although hostility remained at lower levels of the clergy. The treaty as a whole was finally ratified on 16 January 1707 by a majority of 110 votes to 69.{{sfn|Riley|1969|pp=523\u2013524}}\n\nThe two Acts incorporated provisions for Scotland to send [[Scottish representative peers|representative peers]] from the [[Peerage of Scotland]] to sit in the [[House of Lords]]. It guaranteed that the [[Church of Scotland]] would remain the [[established church]] in Scotland, that the [[Court of Session]] would \"remain in all time coming within Scotland\", and that [[Scots law]] would \"remain in the same force as before\". Other provisions included the restatement of the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] and the ban on [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]] from taking the throne. It also created a [[customs union]] and [[monetary union]].\n\nThe Act provided that any \"laws and statutes\" that were \"contrary to or inconsistent with the terms\" of the Act would \"cease and become void\".\n\n===Related Acts===\n\nThe Scottish Parliament also passed the [[Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Act 1707]] guaranteeing the status of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland. The English Parliament passed a similar Act, 6 Anne c.8.\n\nSoon after the Union, the Act 6 Anne c.40{{mdash}}later named the [[Union with Scotland (Amendment) Act 1707]]{{mdash}}united the English and Scottish [[Privy Council]]s and decentralised Scottish administration by appointing justices of the peace in each shire to carry out administration. In effect it took the day-to-day government of Scotland out of the hands of politicians and into those of the [[College of Justice]].\n\nIn the year following the Union, the [[Treason Act 1708]] abolished the Scottish law of [[High treason in the United Kingdom#History: after union with Scotland|treason]] and extended the corresponding English law across Great Britain.\n\n== Evaluations ==\nScotland benefited, says historian G.N. Clark, gaining \"freedom of trade with England and the colonies\" as well as \"a great expansion of markets\". The agreement guaranteed the permanent status of the Presbyterian church in Scotland, and the separate system of laws and courts in Scotland.  Clark argued that in exchange for the financial benefits and bribes that England bestowed, what it gained was\n\n<blockquote>of inestimable value. Scotland accepted the Hanoverian succession and gave up her power of threatening England's military security and complicating her commercial relations ... The sweeping successes of the eighteenth-century wars owed much to the new unity of the two nations.<ref>G.N. Clark, ''The Later Stuarts, 1660\u20131714'' (2nd ed. 1956) pp 290\u201393.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBy the time [[Samuel Johnson]] and [[James Boswell]] made their tour in 1773, recorded in ''[[A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland]]'', Johnson noted that Scotland was \"a nation of which the commerce is hourly extending, and the wealth increasing\" and in particular that [[Glasgow]] had become one of the greatest cities of Britain.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gordon Brown|title=My Scotland, Our Britain: A Future Worth

They put into effect the terms of the [[Treaty of Union]] that had been agreed on 22 July 1706, following negotiation between commissioners representing the parliaments of the two countries. By the two Acts, the [[Kingdom of England]] and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]]{{mdash}}which at the time were separate [[sovereign state|states]] with separate legislatures, but [[Personal union|with the same monarch]]{{mdash}}were, in the words of the Treaty, \"United into One Kingdom by the Name of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]\".<ref>Article I of the Treaty of Union</ref>\n\nThe two countries had shared a monarch since the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603, when [[King James VI of Scotland]] inherited the English throne from his [[double first cousin]] twice removed, [[Queen Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]. Although described as a Union of Crowns, until 1707 there were in fact two separate Crowns resting on the same head (as opposed to the implied creation of a single Crown and a single Kingdom, exemplified by the later [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]). Prior to the Acts of Union there had been three previous attempts (in 1606, 1667, and 1689) to unite the two countries by Acts of Parliament, but it was not until the early 18th century that both political establishments came to support the idea, albeit for different reasons.\n\nThe Acts took effect on 1 May 1707. On this date, the Scottish Parliament and the English Parliament united to form the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], based in the [[Palace of Westminster]] in London, the home of the English Parliament.<ref>[[s:Act of Union 1707|Act of Union 1707]], Article 3</ref> Hence, the Acts are referred to as the '''Union of the Parliaments'''. On the Union, the historian [[Simon Schama]] said \"What began as a hostile merger, would end in a full partnership in the most powerful going concern in the world ... it was one of the most astonishing transformations in European history.\"<ref>{{cite episode |title=Britannia Incorporated|series= A History of Britain |serieslink= Simon Schama's A History of Britain |credits= [[Simon Schama]] (presenter) |network= [[BBC One]] |airdate= 22 May 2001 |number=10 |minutes=3}}</ref>\n\n==Political Background prior to 1707==\n===1603-1660===\nPrior to 1603, England and Scotland were separate kingdoms; as [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] never married, after  1567, her heir became the Stuart king of Scotland, [[James VI and I|James VI]], who was brought up as a Protestant. After her death, the two Crowns were held in personal union by James, as James I of England, and James VI of Scotland. He announced his intention to unite the two, using the [[royal prerogative in the United Kingdom|royal prerogative]] to take the title \"King of Great Britain\", {{sfn|Larkin, Hughes|1973|page=19}} and give a British character to his court and person.{{sfn|Lockyer|1998|pp=51\u201352}}\n[[File:The Signing of the National Covenant in Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Scottish opposition to Stuart attempts to impose religious union led to the 1638 National Covenant]]\nThe 1603 [[Union of England and Scotland Act 1603|Union of England and Scotland Act]] established a joint Commission to agree terms, but the [[English Parliament]] was concerned this would lead to the imposition of an [[absolute monarchy|absolutist]] structure similar to that of Scotland. James was forced to withdraw his proposals, and attempts to revive it in 1610 were met with hostility.{{sfn|Lockyer|1998|pp=54\u201359}}\n\nInstead, he set about creating a unified Church of Scotland and England, as the first step towards a centralised, Unionist state.{{sfn|Stephen|2010|pp=55\u201358}} However, despite both being nominally [[Episcopal_polity|Episcopalian]] in structure, the two were very different in doctrine; the [[Church of Scotland]], or kirk, was [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] in doctrine, and viewed many [[Church of England]] practices as little better than Catholicism.{{sfn|McDonald|1998|pp=75\u201376}} As a result, attempts to impose religious policy by James and his son [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] ultimately led to the 1639-1651 [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]].\n\nThe 1639\u20131640 [[Bishops' Wars]] confirmed the primacy of the kirk, and established a [[Covenanter]] government in Scotland. The Scots remained neutral when the [[First English Civil War]] began in 1642, before becoming concerned at the impact on Scotland of a Royalist victory.{{sfn|Kaplan|1970|pp=50\u201370}} Presbyterian leaders like [[Archibald_Campbell,_1st_Marquess_of_Argyll|Argyll]] viewed union as a way to ensure free trade between England and Scotland, and preserve a Presbyterian kirk.{{sfn|Robertson|2014|p=125}}\n[[File:The Solemn League And Covenant.jpg|thumb|right|The 1643 [[Solemn League and Covenant]] between England and Scotland]]\nUnder the 1643 [[Solemn League and Covenant]], the Covenanters agreed to provide military support for the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]], in return for religious union. Although the treaty referred repeatedly to 'union' between England, Scotland, and Ireland, political union had little support outside the Kirk Party. Even religious union was opposed by the Episcopalian majority in the Church of England, and [[Independent (religion)|Independents]] like [[Oliver Cromwell]], who dominated the [[New Model Army]].\n\nThe Scots and English Presbyterians were political conservatives, who increasingly viewed the Independents, and associated radical groups like the [[Levellers]], as a bigger threat than the Royalists. Both Royalists and Presbyterians agreed monarchy was divinely ordered, but disagreed on the nature and extent of Royal authority over the church. When Charles I surrendered in 1646, they allied with their former enemies to restore him to the English throne.{{sfn|Harris|2015|pp=53\u201354}}\n\nAfter defeat in the 1647\u20131648 [[Second English Civil War]], Scotland was occupied by English troops which were withdrawn once the so-called [[Engagers]] whom Cromwell held responsible for the war had been replaced by the Kirk Party. In December 1648, [[Pride's Purge]] confirmed Cromwell's political control in England by removing Presbyterian MPs from Parliament, and executing Charles in January 1649. Seeing this as sacrilege, the Kirk Party proclaimed [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] King of Scotland and Great Britain, and agreed to restore him to the English throne.\n\nDefeat in the 1649\u20131651 [[Third English Civil War|Third English Civil War or Anglo-Scottish War]] resulted in Scotland's incorporation into the [[Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland]], largely driven by Cromwell's determination to break the power of the kirk, which he held responsible for the Anglo-Scottish War.{{sfn|Morrill|1990|p=162}} The 1652 [[Tender of Union]] was followed on 12 April 1654 by ''An Ordinance by the Protector for the Union of England and Scotland,'' creating the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland]].<ref>[http://www.constitution.org/eng/conpur098.htm Constitution.org]</ref> It was ratified by the [[Second Protectorate Parliament]] on 26 June 1657, creating a single Parliament in Westminster, with 30 representatives each from Scotland and Ireland added to the existing English members.<ref>The 1657 Act's long title was ''An Act and Declaration touching several Acts and Ordinances made since 20 April 1653, and before 3 September 1654, and other Acts''</ref>\n\n===1660-1707===\n[[File:Cromwell at Dunbar Andrew Carrick Gow.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Battle of Dunbar (1650)]]; Scotland was incorporated into the Commonwealth after defeat in the 1650-1651 Anglo-Scots War.]]\nWhile integration into the Commonwealth established free trade between Scotland and England, the economic benefits were diminished by the costs of military occupation.<ref name=\"parliament.uk\">[http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/tk_02_cromwell.html Parliament.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012160340/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/tk_02_cromwell.html |date=12 October 2008 }}</ref> Both Scotland and England associated union with heavy taxes and military rule; it had little popular support in either country, and was dissolved after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of Charles II in 1660.\n\nThe Scottish economy was badly damaged by the English [[Navigation Acts]] of 1660 and 1663 and wars with the Dutch Republic, its major export market. An Anglo-Scots Trade Commission was set up in January 1668 but the English had no interest in making concessions, as the Scots had little to offer in return. In 1669, Charles II revived talks on political union; his motives were to weaken Scotland's commercial and political links with the Dutch, still seen as an enemy and complete the work of his grandfather James I.{{sfn|MacIntosh|2007|pp=79\u201387}} Continued opposition meant these negotiations were abandoned by the end of 1669.{{sfn|Whatley|2001|p=95}}\n\nFollowing the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, a [[Convention of the Estates of Scotland|Scottish Convention]] met in Edinburgh in April 1689 to agree a new constitutional settlement; during which the Scottish Bishops backed a proposed union in an attempt to preserve Episcopalian control of the kirk. [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]] were supportive of the idea but it was opposed both by the Presbyterian majority in Scotland and the English Parliament.{{sfn|Lynch|1992|p=305}} Episcopacy in Scotland was abolished in 1690, alienating a significant part of the political class; it was this element that later formed the bedrock of opposition to Union.{{sfn|Harris|2007|pp=404\u2013406}}\n\nThe 1690s were a time of economic hardship in Europe as a whole and Scotland in particular, a period now known as the [[Seven ill years]] which led to strained relations with England.{{sfn|Whatley|2006|p=91}} In 1698, the [[Company of Scotland|Company of Scotland Trading to Africa and the Indies]] received a charter to raise capital through public subscription.{{sfn|Mitchison|2002|pp=301\u2013302}} The Company invested in the [[Dari\u00e9n scheme]], an ambitious plan funded almost entirely by Scottish investors to build a colony on the [[Isthmus of Panama]] for trade with East Asia.{{sfn|Richards|2004|p=79}} The scheme was a disaster; the losses of over \u00a3150,000 severely impacted the Scottish commercial system.{{sfn|Mitchison|2002|p=314}} \n\n==Political motivations==\n[[File:QueenAnne1702.jpg|thumb|160px||right|Queen Anne in 1702]]\nThe Acts of Union should be seen within a wider European context of increasing state centralisation during the late 17th and early 18th centuries, including the monarchies of France, Sweden, Denmark and Spain. While there were exceptions, such as the [[Dutch Republic]] or the [[Republic of Venice]], the trend was clear.{{sfn|Munck|2005|pp=429\u2013431}}\n\nThe dangers of the monarch using one Parliament against the other first became apparent in 1647 and 1651. It resurfaced during the 1679 to 1681 [[Exclusion Crisis]], caused by English resistance to the Catholic [[James II of England|James]] succeeding his brother Charles. James was sent to Edinburgh in 1681 as [[Lord High Commissioner to the Parliament of Scotland|Lord High Commissioner]]; in August, the Scottish Parliament passed the Succession Act, confirming the divine right of kings, the rights of the natural heir 'regardless of religion,' the duty of all to swear allegiance to that king and the independence of the Scottish Crown. It then went beyond ensuring James's succession to the Scottish throne by explicitly stating the aim was to make his exclusion from the English throne impossible without '...the fatall and dreadfull consequences of a civil war.'{{sfn|Jackson|2003|pp=38\u201354}}\n\nThe issue reappeared during the 1688 [[Glorious Revolution]]. The English Parliament generally supported replacing James with his Protestant daughter [[Mary II]], but resisted making her Dutch husband [[William III & II]] joint ruler. They gave way only when he threatened to return to the Netherlands, and Mary refused to rule without him.{{sfn|Horwitz|1986|pp=10-11}}\n\nIn Scotland, conflict over control of the kirk between Presbyterians and Episcopalians and William's position as a fellow Calvinist put him in a much stronger position. He originally insisted on retaining Episcopacy, and the Committee of the Articles, an unelected body that controlled what legislation Parliament could debate. Both would have given the Crown far greater control than in England but he withdrew his demands due to the 1689-1692 Jacobite Rising.{{sfn|Lynch|1992|pp=300\u2013303}}\n\n=== English perspective ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\nThe English purpose was to ensure that Scotland would not choose a monarch different from the one on the English throne. The two countries had shared a king for much of the previous century, but the English were concerned that an independent Scotland with a different king, even if he were a Protestant, might make alliances against England. The English succession was provided for by the English [[Act of Settlement 1701]], which ensured that the monarch of England would be a Protestant member of the [[House of Hanover]]. Until the Union of Parliaments, the Scottish throne might be inherited by a different successor after [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]: the Scottish [[Act of Security 1704]] granted parliament the right to choose a successor and explicitly required a choice different from the English monarch unless the English were to grant free trade and navigation.\n\n=== Scottish perspective ===\nThe Scottish economy was severely impacted by [[privateers]] during the 1688 to 1697 [[Nine Years War]], and the 1701 [[War of the Spanish Succession]], with the [[Royal Navy]] focusing on protecting English ships. This compounded the economic pressure caused by the [[Darien scheme]], and the [[Seven_ill_years|Seven ill years]] of the 1690s, when between 5-15% of the population died of starvation.{{sfn|Cullen|2010|p=117}} The Scottish Parliament was promised financial assistance, protection for its maritime trade, and an end of economic restrictions on trade with England.{{sfn|Whatley|2001|p=48}}\n\nThe votes of the Court party, combined with the majority of the [[Squadrone Volante (Scotland)|Squadrone Volante]], were sufficient to ensure passage of the treaty. Article 15 granted [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]398,085 10[[Shilling|s]] sterling to Scotland, a sum known as [[The Equivalent]], to offset future liability towards the English national debt. This was used to compensate investors in the Darien scheme, with 58.6% of the fund allocated to its shareholders and creditors.{{sfn|Watt|2007|p=?}}\n[[File:Downsitting of the Scottish Parliament detail.JPG|thumb|left|18th-century French illustration of an opening of the Scottish Parliament]]\nThe role played by bribery has long been debated; \u00a320,000 was distributed by the [[Earl of Glasgow]], of which 60% went to [[James Douglas, 2nd Duke of Queensberry]], the [[Queen's Commissioner in Parliament]]. [[Robert Burns]] is commonly quoted in support; \"We're bought and sold for English Gold, Such a Parcel of Rogues in a Nation.\" As historian [[Christopher Whatley]] points out, this was actually a 17th century Scots folk song; he agrees money was paid, but suggests the economic benefits were supported by most Scots MPs, however reluctantly.{{sfn|Whatley |1989|pp=160-165}}   \n\n[[George Lockhart (politician)|Sir George Lockhart of Carnwath]], the only Scottish negotiator to oppose Union, noted \"the whole nation appears against (it)\".

Elsewhere, there was widespread concern about the independence of the kirk, and possible tax rises.{{sfn|Bambery|2014|p=?}} \n\nAs the Treaty passed through the Scottish Parliament, opposition was voiced by petitions from shires, burghs, presbyteries and parishes. The [[Convention of Royal Burghs]] claimed 'we are not against an honourable and safe union with England', but 'the condition of the people of Scotland, (cannot be) improved without a Scots Parliament'.<ref> The Humble Address of the Commissioners to the General Convention of the Royal Burrows of this Ancient Kingdom Convened the Twenty-Ninth of October 1706, at Edinburgh.</ref> Not one petition in favour of Union was received by Parliament.

Under the aegis of the Queen and her ministers in both kingdoms, the parliaments of England and Scotland agreed to participate in fresh negotiations for a union treaty in 1705.\n\nBoth countries appointed 31 commissioners to conduct the negotiations. Most of the Scottish commissioners favoured union, and about half were government ministers and other officials. At the head of the list was Queensberry, and the [[Lord Chancellor of Scotland]], the [[Earl of Seafield]].<ref name=\"commissioners\">{{cite web | url = http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/04_01_commissioners.html | title = The commissioners | publisher = UK Parliament website | year = 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090619224021/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/04_01_commissioners.html | archivedate = 19 June 2009 | accessdate = 5 February 2013}}</ref> The English commissioners included the [[Lord High Treasurer]], the [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin|Earl of Godolphin]], the [[Lord Keeper of the Great Seal|Lord Keeper]], [[William Cowper, 1st Earl Cowper|Baron Cowper]], and a large number of Whigs who supported union.

Each side had its own particular concerns. Within a few days, England gained a guarantee that the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] dynasty would succeed Queen Anne to the Scottish crown, and Scotland received a guarantee of access to colonial markets, in the hope that they would be placed on an equal footing in terms of trade.<ref name=\"negotiations\">{{cite web | url = http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/04_02_course.html | title = The course of negotiations | publisher = UK Parliament website | year = 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090721014514/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/04_02_course.html | archivedate = 21 July 2009 | accessdate = 5 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter negotiations ended in July 1706, the acts had to be ratified by both Parliaments. In Scotland, about 100 of the 227 members of the [[Parliament of Scotland]] were supportive of the [[Court Party]]. For extra votes the pro-court side could rely on about 25 members of the [[Squadrone Volante (Scotland)|Squadrone Volante]], led by the [[James Graham, 1st Duke of Montrose|Marquess of Montrose]] and the [[Duke of Roxburghe]]. Opponents of the court were generally known as the [[Country Party (Britain)|Country party]], and included various factions and individuals such as the [[Duke of Hamilton]], [[Lord Belhaven]] and [[Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun]], who spoke forcefully and passionately against the union. The Court party enjoyed significant funding from England and the Treasury and included many who had accumulated debts following the [[Darien Disaster]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/05_ratification.html | title = Ratification | publisher = UK parliament website | year = 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090619224031/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/05_ratification.html | archivedate = 19 June 2009 | accessdate = 5 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn Scotland, the [[James Douglas, 2nd Duke of Queensberry|Duke of Queensberry]] was largely responsible for the successful passage of the Union act by the [[Scottish Parliament]]. In Scotland, he received much criticism from local residents, but in England he was cheered for his action. He had received around half of the funding awarded by the Westminster treasury for himself. In April 1707, he travelled to London to attend celebrations at the royal court, and was greeted by groups of noblemen and gentry lined along the road. From [[Chipping Barnet|Barnet]], the route was lined with crowds of cheering people, and once he reached London a huge crowd had formed. On 17 April, the Duke was gratefully received by the Queen at [[Kensington Palace]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/08_union.html | title = 1 May 1707 \u2013 the Union comes into effect | publisher = UK Parliament website | year = 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090619224036/http://www.parliament.uk/actofunion/08_union.html | archivedate = 19 June 2009 | accessdate = 5 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Provisions==\n[[File:Floral Badge of Great Britain.svg|thumb|upright|right|[[Royal Badges of England|Heraldic badge]] of Queen Anne, depicting the [[Tudor rose]] and the [[Scottish thistle]] growing from the same stem.]]\n{{Main|Treaty of Union}}\nThe [[Treaty of Union]], agreed between representatives of the [[Parliament of England]] and the [[Parliament of Scotland]] in 1706, consisted of 25 articles, 15 of which were economic in nature. In Scotland, each article was voted on separately and several clauses in articles were delegated to specialised subcommittees. Article 1 of the treaty was based on the political principle of an incorporating union and this was secured by a majority of 116 votes to 83 on 4 November 1706. To minimise the opposition of the [[Church of Scotland]], an Act was also passed to secure the [[Presbyterian]] establishment of the Church, after which the Church stopped its open opposition, although hostility remained at lower levels of the clergy. The treaty as a whole was finally ratified on 16 January 1707 by a majority of 110 votes to 69.{{sfn|Riley|1969|pp=523\u2013524}}\n\nThe two Acts incorporated provisions for Scotland to send [[Scottish representative peers|representative peers]] from the [[Peerage of Scotland]] to sit in the [[House of Lords]]. It guaranteed that the [[Church of Scotland]] would remain the [[established church]] in Scotland, that the [[Court of Session]] would \"remain in all time coming within Scotland\", and that [[Scots law]] would \"remain in the same force as before\". Other provisions included the restatement of the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] and the ban on [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]] from taking the throne. It also created a [[customs union]] and [[monetary union]].\n\nThe Act provided that any \"laws and statutes\" that were \"contrary to or inconsistent with the terms\" of the Act would \"cease and become void\".\n\n===Related Acts===\n\nThe Scottish Parliament also passed the [[Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Act 1707]] guaranteeing the status of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland. The English Parliament passed a similar Act, 6 Anne c.8.\n\nSoon after the Union, the Act 6 Anne c.40{{mdash}}later named the [[Union with Scotland (Amendment) Act 1707]]{{mdash}}united the English and Scottish [[Privy Council]]s and decentralised Scottish administration by appointing justices of the peace in each shire to carry out administration. In effect it took the day-to-day government of Scotland out of the hands of politicians and into those of the [[College of Justice]].\n\nIn the year following the Union, the [[Treason Act 1708]] abolished the Scottish law of [[High treason in the United Kingdom#History: after union with Scotland|treason]] and extended the corresponding English law across Great Britain.\n\n== Evaluations ==\nScotland benefited, says historian G.N. Clark, gaining \"freedom of trade with England and the colonies\" as well as \"a great expansion of markets\". The agreement guaranteed the permanent status of the Presbyterian church in Scotland, and the separate system of laws and courts in Scotland.  Clark argued that in exchange for the financial benefits and bribes that England bestowed, what it gained was\n\n<blockquote>of inestimable value. Scotland accepted the Hanoverian succession and gave up her power of threatening England's military security and complicating her commercial relations ... The sweeping successes of the eighteenth-century wars owed much to the new unity of the two nations.<ref>G.N.
