The singing and the production start off mellow and rise slowly to a rapturous crescendo.\"\n\n'''Sofia'''\n\nThe [[Ballad]] number \"Sofia\" is a lush melody which starts in a gentle manner backed by [[Keba Jeremiah]]'s wonderful [[guitar]] strums. a gentle but expansively arranged [[Love song|romantic melody]] that touches a new high in the final minute when the choral harmonies kick in, arranged by [[Arjun Chandy]] and [[Leon D'Souza]] supplying the additional vocals, towards the end giving the terrific finish to this beautiful song.\n\n'''Nayi Nayi'''\n\nNayi Nayi is the fast-paced [[Rock music|rock number]] in the album but the track is more generic [[Pop music|pop song]] material single-handedly prodded by Shashwat singh, [[Raftaar (rapper)|Raftaar]] (crooning the [[Rapping|Rap]] portions), with backing vocals by [[Ranjit Barot]], [[Warren Mendonsa]] and Ardeshir Mistry. The arrangements are strictly confined to the hard rock genre with the brief lovely [[Tabla]] cameo in the middle of the track.\n\n'''Humnawaa'''\n\nRahman shared recording of the song \"Humnawaa\" on [[Instagram]], which was sung by [[Armaan Malik]] and [[Shashaa Tirupati]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BynqfaFAKtn/|title=@arrahman on Instagram: \"@armaanmalik22 recording for #99songs a few weeks back \ud83c\udfa4 with @sashasublime\"|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2019-06-28}}</ref> This was the second collaboration between Rahman, Malik and Tirupati after recording for \"Mechanical Sundariye\", the Hindi version of the Original song \"Endhira Logathu Sundhariye\" from ''[[2.0 (film)|2.0]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/watch-ar-rahman-shares-a-sneak-peek-of-armaan-malik-recording-for-99-songs/articleshow/69771970.cms|title=Watch: AR Rahman shares a sneak peek of Armaan Malik recording for '99 Songs' - Times of India|website=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=2019-06-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dnaindia.com/bollywood/report-believe-it-or-not-armaan-malik-did-not-think-he-would-become-bollywood-singer-2769821|title=Believe it or not, Armaan Malik did not think he would become Bollywood singer!|date=2019-07-09|website=DNA India|language=en|access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref> The song written by, Dilshad Shabbir Shaikh and Abhay Jodhpurkar, is based on [[classical music]], [[rhythm and blues]].

The arrangement is once again clever \u2013 a slow-burning prelude that belies what is to come, until the main song kicks in literally with a bang.\n\n'''Sai Shirdi Sai'''\n\nRahman released a song <nowiki>''Sai Shirdi Sai''</nowiki> in three languages (Hindi, Tamil, Telugu),<ref>{{Citation|last=JioStudios|title=Sai Shirdi Sai {{!}} A R Rahman {{!}} Bela Shende {{!}} Full Tamil Lyrical Video {{!}} Mashook Rahman|date=2019-04-14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npz0X9BRHak|access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref> from the movie as a single on 5 April 2019.<ref>{{Citation|last=JioStudios|title=Sai Shirdi Sai {{!}} A R Rahman {{!}} Bela Shende {{!}} Full Hindi Lyrical Video {{!}} Munna Shaukat, Navneet Virk|date=2019-04-14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUDdT-dZPvE|access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref> It is a [[Devotional song|devotional]] [[Sufi (song)|sufi]] number, sung by [[Bela Shende]].

The rap  portions were performed by Shiv (thoughtsfornow). The track is an interesting attempt by the composer despite the multiple elements of the track didn't blend well as expected.\n\n'''The Voice Without Words'''\n\nThe song filled with instrumental and, some with the expansive orchestration, but the whispery words of Poorva Koutish are packed with the hypnotic arrangements.\n\n'''The Oracle'''\n\nIn pre-production period, When the first screenplay draft of ''99 Songs'' was ready for review, [[A.R.

Set in [[Hollywood]], California just prior to [[World War II]], the film depicts the alienation and desperation of a disparate group of individuals whose dreams of success have failed to come true. The screenplay by [[Waldo Salt]] is based on the [[The Day of the Locust|1939 novel of the same title]] by [[Nathanael West]]. \n\nThe film has garnered attention from scholars for its critical commentary on the film industry, as well as its nightmarish depiction of Hollywood, with some critics identifying implicit [[horror film|horror]] elements in the film's visuals.\n\n==Plot==\nAspiring [[impressionism|impressionist]] artist and recent [[Yale University|Yale]] graduate Tod Hackett arrives in 1930s [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] to work as a painter at a major film studio. He rents an apartment in the San Bernardino Arms, a rundown apartment building occupied by various people, many on the fringes of the industry: Among them are Faye Greener, a tawdry aspiring actress; her father Harry, an ex-[[vaudeville|vaudevillian]]; Abe Kusich, a [[dwarfism|dwarf]] who carries on a tempestuous relationship with his girlfriend, Mary; Adore Loomis, a young boy whose mother is hoping to turn him into a [[child actor|child star]]; and Homer Simpson, a [[repression (psychology)|repressed]] accountant who lusts after Faye. Tod's unit has a crack in a wall caused by an earthquake; he puts a bright red flower in the crack. Tod befriends Faye, and attends a screening of a film in which she has a [[bit part]], accompanied by Earle Shoop, a cowboy she is dating. Faye is disappointed with the film after finding that her appearance has been severely truncated. Tod attempts to romance Faye, but she coyly declines him, telling him she would only marry a rich man.\n\nTod attends a party at the [[Hollywood Hills]] mansion, where the partygoers indulge in watching [[stag film]]s. Despite her hesitations, Faye continues to spend time with Tod. The two have a campfire in the desert with Earle and his friend, Miguel. A drunken Tod becomes enraged when Faye dances with Miguel, and chases after her, apparently to rape her, but she fends him off. Some time later, Faye and Homer take Harry to a [[holy roller]] church gathering led by a female preacher known as Big Sister, who performs a public \"healing\" of him in an attempt to cure his heart ailment, but he subsequently dies. In order to pay for Harry's funeral costs, Faye begins prostituting herself.\n\nThe shy, obsessive Homer continue to vie for Faye's affections, caring for her after her father's death. The two eventually move in together, and Faye continues to hopelessly find employment as a movie extra. While filming a [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]-themed period drama, Faye escapes injury during a violent collapse of the set, and reunites with Tod, who witnesses the accident. Faye and Homer subsequently invite Tod to dinner. The three attend a dinner theater featuring a [[drag queen|drag]] show as entertainment. During the dinner, Faye confesses to Tod that her relationship with Homer is sexless, but is loving and offers her security. Later, Faye and Homer host a party attended by Tod, Abe, Earle, Miguel, and Claude Estee, a successful art director. Faye marauds about throughout the party, attempting to impress Claude and the other men. While outside, Homer observes the various men drunkenly fawning over Faye through a window. When Faye notices him, she accuses him of being a [[Voyeurism|peeping tom]] before throwing a vase through the window. Shortly after, Homer walks in on Faye having sex with Miguel. Tod passively ignores the scene, but Earle discovers it and begins fighting with Miguel.\n\nLater, the premiere of ''[[The Buccaneer (1938 film)|The Buccaneer]]'' is taking place at [[TCL Chinese Theatre|Grauman's Chinese Theater]], attended by celebrities and a large crowd of civilians, including Faye. Tod, stuck in traffic due to the event, notices Homer walking aimlessly through the street. He attempts to talk to Homer, but Homer ignores him, seating himself on a bench near the theater. Adore, attending the premiere with his mother, begins pestering Homer before hitting him in the head with a rock. Enraged, Homer chases Adore through the crowd and into a parking lot. When Adore trips and falls, Homer begins violently stomping on him, crushing his bones and organs, effectively killing him. Adore's dying screams draw the attention of the crowd, who come upon Homer standing on the child's bloodied corpse. A mob subsequently pursues Homer, beating him viciously, and a full-blown [[riot]] soon breaks out. Meanwhile, an announcer at the premiere mistakes the action across the street for excitement over the film. Faye is assaulted in the melee, Tod suffers a [[compound fracture]] to his leg, and a car is flipped over, igniting a fire. As Tod observes the frenzy, he witnesses the [[Apparitional experience|apparition]]s of numerous faceless figures from his paintings descending on the scene.\n\nOn a morning shortly thereafter, Faye wanders into Tod's abandoned apartment. She sees everything was removed except for the flower in the wall crack, and her eyes well with tears.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[William Atherton]] as Tod Hackett\n* [[Karen Black]] as Faye Greener\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as Homer Simpson\n* [[Burgess Meredith]] as Harry Greener\n* [[Geraldine Page]] as Big Sister\n* [[Richard Dysart]] as Claude Estee\n* [[John Hillerman]] as Ned Grote\n* [[Bo Hopkins]] as Earle Shoop\n* [[Pepe Serna]] as Miguel\n* [[Lelia Goldoni]] as Mary Dove\n* [[Billy Barty]] as Abe Kusich\n* [[Jackie Earle Haley]] as Adore Loomis\n* [[Gloria LeRoy]] as Mrs. Loomis\n* Jane Hoffman as Mrs. Odlesh\n* Norman Leavitt as Mr. Odlesh\n* [[Madge Kennedy]] as Mrs. Johnson\n* [[Natalie Schafer]] as Audrey Jennings\n* [[Nita Talbot]] as Joan\n* [[William Castle]] as the Director\n}}\n\n==Analysis==\nFilm scholar M.

Set in [[Hollywood]], California just prior to [[World War II]], the film depicts the alienation and desperation of a disparate group of individuals whose dreams of success have failed to come true. The screenplay by [[Waldo Salt]] is based on the [[The Day of the Locust|1939 novel of the same title]] by [[Nathanael West]]. \n\nThe film has garnered attention from scholars for its critical commentary on the film industry, as well as its nightmarish depiction of Hollywood, with some critics identifying implicit [[horror film|horror]] elements in the film's visuals.\n\n==Plot==\nAspiring [[impressionism|impressionist]] artist and recent [[Yale University|Yale]] graduate Tod Hackett arrives in 1930s [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] to work as a painter at a major film studio. He rents an apartment in the San Bernardino Arms, a rundown apartment building occupied by various people, many on the fringes of the industry: Among them are Faye Greener, a tawdry aspiring actress; her father Harry, an ex-[[vaudeville|vaudevillian]]; Abe Kusich, a [[dwarfism|dwarf]] who carries on a tempestuous relationship with his girlfriend, Mary; Adore Loomis, a young boy whose mother is hoping to turn him into a [[child actor|child star]]; and Homer Simpson, a [[repression (psychology)|repressed]] accountant who lusts after Faye. Tod's unit has a crack in a wall caused by an earthquake; he puts a bright red flower in the crack. Tod befriends Faye, and attends a screening of a film she has a [[bit part]] in, accompanied by Earle Shoop, a cowboy she is dating. Faye is disappointed with the film after finding that her appearance has been severely truncated. Tod attempts to romance Faye, but she coyly declines him, telling him she would only marry a rich man.\n\nTod attends a party at the [[Hollywood Hills]] mansion, where the partygoers indulge in watching [[stag film]]s. Despite her hesitations, Faye continues to spend time with Tod. The two have a campfire in the desert with Earle and his friend, Miguel. A drunken Tod becomes enraged when Faye dances with Miguel, and chases after her, apparently to rape her, but she fends him off. Some time later, Faye and Homer take Harry to a [[holy roller]] church gathering led by a female preacher known as Big Sister, who performs a public \"healing\" of him in an attempt to cure his heart ailment, but he subsequently dies. In order to pay for Harry's funeral costs, Faye begins prostituting herself.\n\nThe shy, obsessive Homer continue to vie for Faye's affections, caring for her after her father's death. The two eventually move in together, and Faye continues to hopelessly find employment as a movie extra. While filming a [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]-themed period drama, Faye escapes injury during a violent collapse of the set, and reunites with Tod, who witnesses the accident. Faye and Homer subsequently invite Tod to dinner. The three attend a dinner theater featuring a [[drag queen|drag]] show as entertainment. During the dinner, Faye confesses to Tod that her relationship with Homer is sexless, but is loving and offers her security. Later, Faye and Homer host a party attended by Tod, Abe, Earle, Miguel, and Claude Estee, a successful art director. Faye marauds about throughout the party, attempting to impress Claude and the other men. While outside, Homer observes the various men drunkenly fawning over Faye through a window. When Faye notices him, she accuses him of being a [[Voyeurism|peeping tom]] before throwing a vase through the window. Shortly after, Homer walks in on Faye having sex with Miguel. Tod passively ignores the scene, but Earle discovers it and begins fighting with Miguel.\n\nLater, the premiere of ''[[The Buccaneer (1938 film)|The Buccaneer]]'' is taking place at [[TCL Chinese Theatre|Grauman's Chinese Theater]], attended by celebrities and a large crowd of civilians, including Faye. Tod, stuck in traffic due to the event, notices Homer walking aimlessly through the street. He attempts to talk to Homer, but Homer ignores him, seating himself on a bench near the theater. Adore, attending the premiere with his mother, begins pestering Homer before hitting him in the head with a rock. Enraged, Homer chases Adore through the crowd and into a parking lot. When Adore trips and falls, Homer begins violently stomping on him, crushing his bones and organs, effectively killing him. Adore's dying screams draw the attention of the crowd, who come upon Homer standing on the child's bloodied corpse. A mob subsequently pursues Homer, beating him viciously, and a full-blown [[riot]] soon breaks out. Meanwhile, an announcer at the premiere mistakes the action across the street for excitement over the film. Faye is assaulted in the melee, Tod suffers a [[compound fracture]] to his leg, and a car is flipped over, igniting a fire. As Tod observes the frenzy, he witnesses the [[Apparitional experience|apparition]]s of numerous faceless figures from his paintings descending on the scene.\n\nOn a morning shortly thereafter, Faye wanders into Tod's abandoned apartment. She sees everything was removed except for the flower in the wall crack, and her eyes well with tears.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[William Atherton]] as Tod Hackett\n* [[Karen Black]] as Faye Greener\n* [[Donald Sutherland]] as Homer Simpson\n* [[Burgess Meredith]] as Harry Greener\n* [[Geraldine Page]] as Big Sister\n* [[Richard Dysart]] as Claude Estee\n* [[John Hillerman]] as Ned Grote\n* [[Bo Hopkins]] as Earle Shoop\n* [[Pepe Serna]] as Miguel\n* [[Lelia Goldoni]] as Mary Dove\n* [[Billy Barty]] as Abe Kusich\n* [[Jackie Earle Haley]] as Adore Loomis\n* [[Gloria LeRoy]] as Mrs. Loomis\n* Jane Hoffman as Mrs. Odlesh\n* Norman Leavitt as Mr. Odlesh\n* [[Madge Kennedy]] as Mrs. Johnson\n* [[Natalie Schafer]] as Audrey Jennings\n* [[Nita Talbot]] as Joan\n* [[William Castle]] as the Director\n}}\n\n==Analysis==\nFilm scholar M.

They can either be a form of written [[translation]] of a dialog in a foreign language, or a written rendering of the dialog in the same language, with or without added information to help viewers who are [[deaf]] or [[hard of hearing]] to follow the dialog, or people who cannot understand the spoken dialogue or who have accent recognition problems.\n\nThe encoded method can either be pre-rendered with the video or separate as either a graphic or text to be rendered and overlaid by the receiver.  The separate subtitles are used for [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray]] and television [[teletext]]/[[Digital Video Broadcasting]] (DVB) subtitling or [[EIA-608]] captioning, which are hidden unless requested by the viewer from a menu or remote controller key or by selecting the relevant page or service (e.g., p.&nbsp;888 or CC1), always carry additional sound representations for deaf and hard of hearing viewers. Teletext subtitle language follows the original audio, except in multi-lingual countries where the broadcaster may provide subtitles in additional languages on other teletext pages.  EIA-608 captions are similar, except that North American Spanish stations may provide captioning in Spanish on CC3. DVD and Blu-ray only differ in using [[run-length]] encoded graphics instead of text, as well as some HD DVB broadcasts.\n\nSometimes, mainly at [[film festival]]s, subtitles may be shown on a separate display below the screen, thus saving the film-maker from creating a subtitled copy for perhaps just one showing. Television subtitling for the deaf and hard of hearing is also referred to as [[closed captioning]] in some countries.\n\nMore exceptional uses also include operas, such as Verdi's Aida, where sung lyrics in Italian are subtitled in English or in another local language outside the stage area on luminous screens for the audience to follow the storyline, or on a screen attached to the back of the chairs in front of the audience.\n\nThe word ''subtitle'' is the prefix ''sub-'' (\"below\") followed by ''title''. In some cases, such as live [[opera]], the dialog is displayed above the stage in what are referred to as ''[[surtitles]]'' (''sur-'' meaning \"above\").\n\n== Creation, delivery and display of subtitles ==\n\nToday, professional subtitlers usually work with specialized computer software and hardware where the video is digitally stored on a hard disk, making each individual frame instantly accessible. Besides creating the subtitles, the subtitler usually also tells the computer software the exact positions where each subtitle should appear and disappear. For cinema film, this task is traditionally done by separate technicians. The end result is a subtitle file containing the actual subtitles as well as position markers indicating where each subtitle should appear and disappear. These markers are usually based on [[SMPTE time code|timecode]] if it is a work for electronic media (e.g., TV, video, DVD), or on film length (measured in feet and frames) if the subtitles are to be used for traditional cinema film.\n\nThe finished subtitle file is used to add the subtitles to the picture, either:\n* directly into the picture (open subtitles);\n* embedded in the [[vertical interval]] and later superimposed on the picture by the end user with the help of an external decoder or a decoder built into the TV (closed subtitles on TV or video);\n* or converted (rendered) to [[Tagged Image File Format|tiff]] or [[BMP file format|bmp]] graphics that are later superimposed on the picture by the end user's equipment (closed subtitles on DVD or as part of a DVB broadcast).\n\nSubtitles can also be created by individuals using freely available subtitle-creation software like [[Subtitle Workshop]] for Windows, [[MovieCaptioner]] for Mac/Windows, and [[Subtitle Composer]] for Linux, and then hardcode them onto a video file with programs such as [[VirtualDub]] in combination with [[VSFilter]] which could also be used to show subtitles as softsubs in many [[Video player (software)|software video players]].\n\nFor multimedia-style [[Webcasting]], check:\n* SMIL [[Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language]];\n* [[Timed Text]] [[DFXP]].\n\n==Automatic captioning==\nSome programs and online software allow automatic captions, mainly using [[speech-to-text]] features.\n\nFor example, in [[YouTube]],  automatic captions are available in English, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. If automatic captions are available for the language, they will automatically be published on the video.<ref>[https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6373554?hl=en Use automatic captioning], [[YouTube]].</ref>\n\n== Same-language captions ==\nSame-language captions, i.e., without translation, were primarily intended as an aid for people who are deaf or hard of hearing. Internationally, there are several major studies which demonstrate that same-language captioning can have a major impact on literacy and reading growth across a broad range of reading abilities.<ref name=AshokaBrij>''[http://www.ashoka.org/fellow/3557 Brij Kothari] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828182628/http://www.ashoka.org/fellow/3557 |date=2008-08-28 }}'' from  [http://www.ashoka.org/ Ashoka.org].

This idea was struck upon by [[Brij Kothari]], who believed that SLS makes reading practice an incidental, automatic, and subconscious part of popular TV entertainment, at a low per-person cost to shore up [[Literacy in India|literacy rates in India]].\n\n=== Same-language subtitling ===\n[[Same language subtitling]] (SLS) is the use of synchronized captioning of musical lyrics (or any text with an audio/video source) as a repeated reading activity. The basic reading activity involves students viewing a short subtitled presentation projected onscreen, while completing a response worksheet. To be really effective, the subtitling should have high quality synchronization of audio and text, and better yet, subtitling should change color in syllabic synchronization to audio model, and the text should be at a level to challenge students' language abilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://go.editlib.org/p/27350|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709105516/http://go.editlib.org/p/27350|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-07-09|title=McCall, W.

These are a transcription rather than a translation, and usually contain descriptions of important non-dialog audio as well such as \"(SIGHS)\", \"(WIND HOWLING)\", \"(\"SONG TITLE\" PLAYING)\", \"(KISSES)\", \"(THUNDER RUMBLING)\" or \"(DOOR CREAKING)\" and lyrics. From the expression \"closed captions\" the word \"caption\" has in recent years come to mean a subtitle intended for the deaf or hard of hearing, be it \"open\" or \"closed\". In British English \"subtitles\" usually refers to subtitles for the  deaf or hard of hearing (SDH); however, the term \"SDH\" is sometimes used when there is a need to make a distinction between the two.\n\n==== Real time ====\nPrograms such as news bulletins, current affairs programs, sport, some talk shows and political and special events utilize real time or online captioning.<ref name=\"dcita\">{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.dcita.gov.au/media_broadcasting/consultation_and_submissions/captioning_standards_review/submissions_to_the_captioning_standards_review\n |title        = Submissions to the captioning standards review &#124; Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts\n |access-date   = 2007-04-04\n |author1      = Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts\n |authorlink1  = Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Australia)\n |author2      = [http://www.auscap.com.au/ Australian Caption Centre]\n |date         = 1999-02-26\n |format       = [[Microsoft Word]]\n |quote        = [http://www.dcita.gov.au/__data/assets/word_doc/10835/Australian_Caption_Centre.doc Australian Caption Centre]\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070908193257/http://www.dcita.gov.au/media_broadcasting/consultation_and_submissions/captioning_standards_review/submissions_to_the_captioning_standards_review#\n |archive-date = 2007-09-08\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           =\n}}</ref> Live captioning is increasingly common, especially in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]], as a result of regulations that stipulate that virtually all TV eventually must be accessible for people who are deaf and hard\u2013of\u2013hearing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncicap.org/caphist.asp |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-04-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719060406/http://www.ncicap.org/caphist.asp |archive-date=2011-07-19 |df= }}</ref> In practice, however, these \"real time\" subtitles will typically lag the audio by several seconds due to the inherent delay in transcribing, encoding, and transmitting the subtitles. Real time subtitles are also challenged by typographic errors or mis-hearing of the spoken words, with no time available to correct before transmission.\n\n===== Pre-prepared =====\nSome programs may be prepared in their entirety several hours before broadcast, but with insufficient time to prepare a timecoded caption file for automatic play-out. Pre-prepared captions look similar to offline captions, although the accuracy of cueing may be compromised slightly as the captions are not locked to program timecode.<ref name=\"dcita\" />\n\nNewsroom captioning involves the automatic transfer of text from the newsroom computer system to a device which outputs it as captions. It does work, but its suitability as an exclusive system would only apply to programs which had been scripted in their entirety on the newsroom computer system, such as short interstitial updates.<ref name=\"dcita\" />\n\nIn the United States and Canada, some broadcasters have used it exclusively and simply left uncaptioned sections of the bulletin for which a script was unavailable.<ref name=\"dcita\" /> Newsroom captioning limits captions to pre-scripted materials and, therefore, does not cover 100% of the news, weather and sports segments of a typical local news broadcast which are typically not pre-scripted, last-second breaking news or changes to the scripts, ad lib conversations of the broadcasters, emergency or other live remote broadcasts by reporters in-the-field. By failing to cover items such as these, newsroom style captioning (or use of the [[Teleprompter]] for captioning) typically results in coverage of less than 30% of a local news broadcast.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.captioncolorado.com/about/index.html\n| title = Caption Colorado\n| accessdate = 2007-10-24\n| author = [http://www.captioncolorado.com/about/index.html Caption Colorado]\n| year = 2002\n| quote=\"Real-time\" vs. Newsroom Captioning<br /> Caption Colorado offers \"real-time\" closed captioning that utilizes unique technologies coupled with the talents of highly skilled captioners who use stenographic court reporting machines to transcribe the audio on the fly, as the words are spoken by the broadcasters. real-time captioning is not limited to pre-scripted materials and, therefore, covers 100% of the news, weather and sports segments of a typical local news broadcast. It will cover such things as the weather and sports segments which are typically not pre-scripted, last second breaking news or changes to the scripts, ad lib conversations of the broadcasters, emergency or other live remote broadcasts by reporters in the field.

Speech recognition technology has advanced so quickly in the United States that about 50% of all live captioning was through speech recognition as of 2005.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Real-time captions look different from offline captions, as they are presented as a continuous flow of text as people speak.<ref name=\"dcita\" />{{clarify|date=November 2011}}\n\nStenography is a system of rendering words phonetically, and English, with its multitude of homophones (e.g., there, their, they're), is particularly unsuited to easy transcriptions. Stenographers working in courts and inquiries usually have 24 hours in which to deliver their transcripts. Consequently, they may enter the same phonetic stenographic codes for a variety of homophones, and fix up the spelling later. Real-time stenographers must deliver their transcriptions accurately and immediately. They must therefore develop techniques for keying homophones differently, and be unswayed by the pressures of delivering accurate product on immediate demand.<ref name=\"dcita\" />\n\nSubmissions to recent captioning-related inquiries have revealed concerns from broadcasters about captioning sports. Captioning sports may also affect many different people because of the weather outside of it. In much sport captioning's absence, the Australian Caption Centre submitted to the National Working Party on Captioning (NWPC), in November 1998, three examples of sport captioning, each performed on tennis, rugby league and swimming programs:\n* Heavily reduced: Captioners ignore commentary and provide only scores and essential information such as \"try\" or \"out\".\n* Significantly reduced: Captioners use [[QWERTY]] input to type summary captions yielding the essence of what the commentators are saying, delayed due to the limitations of QWERTY input.\n* Comprehensive realtime: Captioners use stenography to caption the commentary in its entirety.<ref name=\"dcita\" />\n\nThe NWPC concluded that the standard they accept is the comprehensive real-time method, which gives them access to the commentary in its entirety. Also, not all sports are live.  Many events are pre-recorded hours before they are broadcast, allowing a captioner to caption them using offline methods.<ref name=\"dcita\" />\n\n===== Hybrid =====\nBecause different programs are produced under different conditions, a case-by-case basis must consequently determine captioning methodology. Some bulletins may have a high incidence of truly live material, or insufficient access to video feeds and scripts may be provided to the captioning facility, making stenography unavoidable. Other bulletins may be pre-recorded just before going to air, making pre-prepared text preferable.<ref name=\"dcita\" />\n\nNews captioning applications currently available are designed to accept text from a variety of inputs: stenography, Velotype, QWERTY, [[ASCII]] import, and the newsroom computer. This allows one facility to handle a variety of online captioning requirements and to ensure that captioners properly caption all programs.<ref name=\"dcita\" />\n\nCurrent affairs programs usually require stenographic assistance. Even though the segments which comprise a current affairs program may be produced in advance, they are usually done so just before on-air time and their duration makes QWERTY input of text unfeasible.<ref name=\"dcita\" />\n\nNews bulletins, on the other hand, can often be captioned without stenographic input (unless there are live crosses or ad-libbing by the presenters).  This is because:\n* Most items are scripted on the newsroom computer system and this text can be electronically imported into the captioning system.\n* Individual news stories are of short duration, so even if they are made available only just prior to broadcast, there is still time to use QWERTY in text.<ref name=\"dcita\" />\n\n==== Offline ====\nFor non-live, or pre-recorded programs, television program providers can choose offline captioning. Captioners gear offline captioning toward the high-end television industry, providing highly customized captioning features, such as pop-on style captions, specialized screen placement, speaker identifications, italics, special characters, and sound effects.<ref name=\"Offline\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.captioncolorado.com/products/offline.html\n| title = Caption Colorado\n| \naccessdate = 2007-10-24\n| author = [http://www.captioncolorado.com/about/index.html Caption Colorado]\n| year = 2002\n| quote = Offline Captioning<br /> For non-live, or pre-recorded programs, you can choose from two presentation styles models for offline captioning or transcription needs in English or Spanish.<br /> <br /> Premiere Offline Captioning<br /> Premiere Offline Captioning is geared toward the high-end television industry, providing highly customized captioning features, such as pop-on style captions, specialized screen placement, speaker identifications, italics, special characters, and sound effects.<br /> <br /> Premiere Offline involves a five-step design and editing process, and does much more than simply display the text of a program.

It refers to regular subtitles in the original language where important non-dialog information has been added, as well as speaker identification, which may be useful when the viewer cannot otherwise visually tell who is saying what.\n\nThe only significant difference for the user between SDH subtitles and closed captions is their appearance: SDH subtitles usually are displayed with the same proportional font used for the translation subtitles on the DVD; however, closed captions are displayed as white text on a black band, which blocks a large portion of the view. Closed captioning is falling out of favor as many users have no difficulty reading SDH subtitles, which are text with contrast outline. In addition, DVD subtitles can specify many colors, on the same character: primary, outline, shadow, and background. This allows subtitlers to display subtitles on a usually translucent band for easier reading; however, this is rare, since most subtitles use an outline and shadow instead, in order to block a smaller portion of the picture. Closed captions may still supersede DVD subtitles, since many SDH subtitles present all of the text centered, while closed captions usually specify position on the screen: centered, left align, right align, top, etc. This is helpful for speaker identification and overlapping conversation. Some SDH  subtitles (such as the subtitles of newer [[Universal Studios]] DVDs/Blu-ray Discs) do have positioning, but it is not as common.\n\nDVDs for the U.S. market now sometimes have three forms of English subtitles: SDH subtitles; English subtitles, helpful for viewers who may not be hearing impaired but whose first language may not be English (although they are usually an exact transcript and not simplified); and closed caption data that is decoded by the end-user's closed caption decoder. Most anime releases in the U.S. only include as subtitles translations of the original material; therefore, SDH subtitles of English dubs (\"dubtitles\") are uncommon.\n<ref>{{cite video\n| people     = [[U.S. Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC)\n| title      = Closed Captioning and the DTV Transition\n| url        = http://www.dtv.gov/video/DTV_ASL-Part3.html\n| date       = 2008-05-01\n| format     = [[SWF|swf]]\n| location   = [[Washington, D.C.]]\n| time       = 1m58s\n| quote      = In addition to passing through closed caption signals, many converter boxes also include the ability to take over the captioning role that the tuner plays in your analog TV set.

In October 2015, major studios and [[Netflix]] were sued over this practice, citing claims of [[false advertising]] (as the work is henceforth not completely subtitled) and [[civil rights]] violations (under California's [[Unruh Civil Rights Act]], guaranteeing equal rights for people with disabilities). Judge [[Stephen Victor Wilson]] dismissed the suit in September 2016, ruling that allegations of civil rights violations did not present evidence of intentional discrimination against viewers with disabilities, and that allegations over misrepresenting the extent of subtitles \"fall far short of demonstrating that reasonable consumers would actually be deceived as to the amount of subtitled content provided, as there are no representations whatsoever that all song lyrics would be captioned, or even that the content would be 'fully' captioned.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2015/10/hollywood-studios-netflix-class-action-lawsuit-hearing-impaired-civil-right-violations-1201588229/|title=Hollywood Studios & Netflix Blasted For Civil Rights Violations In Song-Captioning Class Action|last=Patten|first=Dominic|date=2015-10-20|website=Deadline|language=en|access-date=2019-07-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/20/netflix-film-studios-lawsuit-song-captioning-deaf-skyfall|title=Netflix and film studios face lawsuit over song captioning for deaf|date=2015-10-20|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-07-08|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n=== Use by those not deaf or hard of hearing ===\nAlthough same-language subtitles and captions are produced primarily with the deaf and hard of hearing in mind, they may also be used to ensure understanding of dialogue (such as those spoken quietly or mixed in with sound effects, by those with accents unfamiliar to the intended audience, or supportive dialogue from background or off-screen characters). Jason Kehe of ''Wired'' noted that habitual use of subtitles by the non-deaf has been a growing trend for these reasons, and to help pick up on additional details and information found within dialogue. He drew comparisons to the ubiquity of search engines by stating that \"just like [[Google Search|Google]], closed captions are there, eminently accessible, ready to clarify the unclarities, and so, desperately, we, the paranoids and obsessive-compulsives and postmodern completists, click.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/closed-captions-everywhere/|title=The Real Reason You Use Closed Captions for Everything Now|last=Kehe|first=Jason|date=2018-06-26|work=Wired|access-date=2019-07-08|issn=1059-1028}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tv-closed-captions-movie-subtitles-benefits|title=Get Over Your Fear Of Subtitles, Please|last=Farley|first=Rebecca|website=Refinery29|language=en|access-date=2019-07-08}}</ref> Studies (including those by the [[University of Nottingham]] and the What Works Clearinghouse of the [[United States Department of Education]]) have found that use of subtitles can help promote [[reading comprehension]] in school-aged children.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2015/07/21/closed-captioning-gives-literacy-a-boost.html|title=Closed Captioning Gives Literacy a Boost|date=2015-07-21|work=Education Week|access-date=2019-07-08}}</ref>\n\n==== Asia ====\nIn some Asian television programming, captioning is considered a part of the genre, and has evolved beyond simply capturing what is being said. The captions are used artistically; it is common to see the words appear one by one as they are spoken, in a multitude of fonts, colors, and sizes that capture the spirit of what is being said. Languages like Japanese also have a rich vocabulary of [[Japanese sound symbolism|onomatopoeia]] which is used in captioning.\n\n===== East Asia =====\nIn some East Asian countries, especially Chinese-speaking ones, subtitling is common in all taped television programs. In these countries, written text remains mostly uniform while regional dialects in the spoken form can be mutually unintelligible. Therefore, subtitling offers a distinct advantage to aid comprehension. With subtitles, programs in [[Putonghua]], the standard Mandarin, or any dialect can be understood by viewers unfamiliar with it.\n\nOn-screen subtitles as seen in Japanese variety television shows are more for decorative purpose, something that is not seen in television in Europe and the Americas. Some shows even place [[sound effect]]s over those subtitles. This practice of subtitling has been spread to neighbouring countries including South Korea and Taiwan. [[Asia Television|ATV]] in Hong Kong once practiced this style of decorative subtitles on its variety shows when it was owned by [[Want Want]] Holdings in Taiwan (which also owns [[China Television|CTV]] and [[Chung T'ien Television|CTI]]).\n\n===== South Asia =====\nIn [[India]], [[Same Language Subtitling]] (SLS) are common for films and music videos. SLS refers to the idea of subtitling in the same language as the audio. SLS is highlighted [[karaoke]] style, that is, to speech. The idea of SLS was initiated to shore up literacy rates as SLS makes reading practice an incidental, automatic, and subconscious part of popular TV entertainment. This idea was well received by the [[Government of India]] which now uses SLS on several national channels, including [[Doordarshan]].<ref name=\"AshokaBrij\" /><ref name=autogenerated1>Biswas, Ranjita (2005).

Accessed on February 10, 2009</ref>\n\n== Translation ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\nTranslation basically means conversion of one language into another language in wrtten or spoken form. The process of translation requires a translator e.g. Google Translate,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://translate.google.co.in/|title=Google Translate|website=translate.google.co.in}}</ref> Microsoft Translator.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://translator.microsoft.com/|title=Break the language barrier|website=Break the language barrier &#124; Conversations}}</ref> Subtitles can be used to translate dialog from a foreign language into the native language of the audience. It is not only the quickest and cheapest method of translating content, but is also usually preferred as it is possible for the audience to hear the original dialog and voices of the actors.\n\nSubtitle translation can be different from the [[translation]] of written text. Usually, during the process of creating subtitles for a film or television program, the picture and each sentence of the audio are analyzed by the subtitle translator; also, the subtitle translator may or may not have access to a written transcript of the dialog. Especially in the field of commercial subtitles, the subtitle translator often interprets what is meant, rather than translating the manner in which the dialog is stated; that is, the meaning is more important than the form\u2014the audience does not always appreciate this, as it can be frustrating for people who are familiar with some of the spoken language; spoken language may contain verbal padding or culturally implied meanings that cannot be conveyed in the written subtitles. Also, the subtitle translator may also condense the dialog to achieve an acceptable reading speed, whereby purpose is more important than form.\n\nEspecially in [[fansub]]s, the subtitle translator may translate both form and meaning. The subtitle translator may also choose to display a note in the subtitles, usually in [[parentheses]] (\u201c[[wikt:(|(]]\u201d and \u201c[[wikt:)|)]]\u201d), or as a separate block of on-screen text\u2014this allows the subtitle translator to preserve form and achieve an acceptable reading speed; that is, the subtitle translator may leave a note on the screen, even after the character has finished speaking, to both preserve form and facilitate understanding. For example, the Japanese language has multiple first-person pronouns (see [[Japanese pronouns]]) and each pronoun is associated with a different degree of politeness. In order to compensate during the English translation process, the subtitle translator may reformulate the sentence, add appropriate words and/or use notes.\n\n=== Subtitling ===\n\n==== Real-time ====\nReal-time translation subtitling usually involves an interpreter and a stenographer working concurrently, whereby the former quickly translates to the dialog while the latter types; this form of subtitling is rare. The unavoidable delay, typing errors, lack of editing, and high cost mean that real-time translation subtitling is in low demand. Allowing the interpreter to directly speak to the viewers is usually both cheaper and quicker; however, the translation is not accessible to people who are deaf and hard-of-hearing.\n\n==== Offline ====\nSome subtitlers purposely provide edited subtitles or captions to match the needs of their audience, for learners of the spoken dialog as a second or foreign language, visual learners, beginning readers who are deaf or hard of hearing and for people with learning and/or mental disabilities. For example, for many of its films and television programs, [[PBS]] displays  standard captions representing speech the program audio, word-for-word, if the viewer selects \"CC1\" by using the television remote control or on-screen menu; however, they also provide edited captions to present simplified sentences at a slower rate, if the viewer selects \"CC2\". Programs with a diverse audience also often have captions in another language. This is common with popular Latin American [[soap opera]]s in Spanish. Since CC1 and CC2 share [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], the [[U.S. Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) recommends translation subtitles be placed in CC3. CC4, which shares bandwidth with CC3, is also available, but programs seldom use it.\n\n=== Subtitles vs. dubbing and lectoring ===\nThe two alternative methods of 'translating' films in a foreign language are [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]], in which other actors record over the voices of the original actors in a different language, and [[Voice-over translation|lectoring]], a form of [[voice-over]] for fictional material where a narrator tells the audience what the actors are saying while their voices can be heard in the background. Lectoring is common for television in Russia, Poland, and a few other East European countries, while cinemas in these countries commonly show films dubbed or subtitled.\n\nThe preference for dubbing or subtitling in various countries is largely based on decisions taken in the late 1920s and early 1930s. With the arrival of sound film, the film importers in [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[France]] and [[Spain]] decided to dub the foreign voices, while the rest of Europe elected to display the dialog as translated subtitles. The choice was largely due to financial reasons (subtitling is more economical and quicker than dubbing), but during the 1930s it also became a political preference in Germany, Italy and Spain; an expedient form of [[censorship]] that ensured that foreign views and ideas could be stopped from reaching the local audience, as dubbing makes it possible to create a dialogue which is totally different from the original. In larger German cities a few \"special cinemas\" use subtitling instead of dubbing.\n\nDubbing is still the norm and favored form in these four countries, but the proportion of subtitling is slowly growing, mainly to save cost and turnaround-time, but also due to a growing acceptance among younger generations, who are better readers and increasingly have a basic knowledge of English (the dominant language in film and TV) and thus prefer to hear the original dialogue.\n\nNevertheless, in Spain, for example, only public TV channels show subtitled foreign films, usually at late night. It is extremely rare that any Spanish TV channel shows subtitled versions of TV programs, series or documentaries. With the advent of digital land broadcast TV, it has become common practice in Spain to provide optional audio and subtitle streams that allow watching dubbed programmes with the original audio and subtitles. In addition, only a small proportion of cinemas show subtitled films. Films with dialogue in Galician, Catalan or Basque are always dubbed, not subtitled, when they are shown in the rest of the country. Some non-Spanish-speaking TV stations subtitle interviews in Spanish; others do not.\n\nIn many [[Latin America]]n countries, local network television will show dubbed versions of English-language programs and movies, while cable stations (often international) more commonly broadcast subtitled material. Preference for subtitles or dubbing varies according to individual taste and reading ability, and theaters may order two prints of the most popular films, allowing moviegoers to choose between dubbing or subtitles. Animation and children's programming, however, is nearly universally dubbed, as in other regions.\n\nSince the introduction of the DVD and, later, the Blu-ray Disc, some high budget films include the simultaneous option of ''both'' subtitles and/or dubbing. Often in such cases, the translations are made separately, rather than the subtitles being a verbatim transcript of the dubbed scenes of the film. While this allows for the smoothest possible flow of the subtitles, it can be frustrating for someone attempting to learn a foreign language.\n\nIn the traditional subtitling countries, dubbing is generally regarded as something strange and unnatural and is only used for animated films and TV programs intended for pre-school children. As animated films are \"dubbed\" even in their original language and ambient noise and effects are usually recorded on a separate sound track, dubbing a low quality production into a second language produces little or no noticeable effect on the viewing experience. In dubbed live-action television or film, however, viewers are often distracted by the fact that the audio does not match the actors' lip movements.  Furthermore, the dubbed voices may seem detached, inappropriate for the character, or overly expressive, and some ambient sounds may not be transferred to the dubbed track, creating a less enjoyable viewing experience.\n\n=== Subtitling as a practice ===\nIn several countries or regions nearly all foreign language TV programs are subtitled, instead of dubbed, notably in:\n* [[Albania]] (most all foreign-language shows are subtitled in [[Albanian language|Albanian]], children's movies and TV shows are dubbed, mostly animated)\n* [[Argentina]] (cable/satellite TV and cinemas)\n* [[Armenia]] (Subtitles in [[Armenian language|Armenian]], children's shows principally are dubbed)\n* [[Arab world|Arab Middle East and North Africa]] -- [[Modern Standard Arabic]]-language subtitling, used for foreign programming/cinema and often used when Arabic dialects are the primary medium of a film/TV program. Countries such as Lebanon, Algeria, and Morocco also often include French subtitling simultaneously.\n* [[Australia]] (especially by [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]])\n* [[Belgium]] (Subtitles in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] in [[Flanders]], dubbed into [[French language|French]] in [[Wallonia]], bilingual [Dutch-French] subtitles in Flemish and Brussels movie theaters, dubbed versions in Wallonia. Children's shows and teleshopping are dubbed)\n* [[Bolivia]]\n* [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (Children's shows are dubbed in Serbian, Croatian or Bosnian, everything else subtitled in Bosnian)\n* [[Brazil]] (some cinemas and cable channels use [[Brazilian Portuguese]] subtitles)\n* [[Chile]] (cable/satellite TV only)\n* [[China]] (Most Chinese language programming includes subtitles in Chinese, since many languages and dialects are spoken by the populace, but the writing system is independent of dialects)\n* [[Colombia]] (cable/satellite TV only)\n* [[Cuba]]\n* [[Costa Rica]] (cable/satellite TV, and on some national channels like Channel 7)\n* [[Croatia]] (Children's shows are dubbed in Croatian, everything else is subtitled in Croatian)\n* [[Denmark]] ([[Danish language|Danish]] subtitles in all foreign programmes except children's shows)\n* [[Estonia]] ([[Estonian language]] subtitles are used in foreign films and television programmes except for children's media)\n* [[Finland]] (Subtitles in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] or [[Swedish language|Swedish]], Finland is [[Languages of Finland|bilingual]]; in TV children's programs are dubbed and off-screen narration in documentaries is often dubbed)\n* [[Greece]] (only children's shows and films are dubbed)\n* [[Hong Kong]] (Dubbing in [[Cantonese]] often happens, but subtitling is also common, since these foreign programs are often broadcast in multiple languages)\n* [[Iceland]] (Subtitles in Icelandic. Television programming and motion pictures directed towards children are dubbed, although cinemas often offer subtitled late-evening screenings of the latter. The off-screen narration in documentaries may be dubbed, although on-screen dialogue are always subtitle)\n* [[India]] (Most English channels now give subtitles of their programmes in English)\n* [[Indonesia]] (Subtitles in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], some foreign movies have subtitles of more than one language)\n* [[Ireland]] (Subtitles in English for non-English programmes, including those in the [[Irish language]]. Occasional subtitles in [[Irish language]] for programmes shown on the Irish language channel: [[TG4]])\n* [[Israel]] (Non-Hebrew television programmes and films are always translated into Hebrew with subtitles. Bilingual Hebrew/Arabic or Hebrew/Russian subtitling, showing translation into both languages simultaneously, is common on public TV channels. Dubbing is restricted to programmes and films aimed at children below school age. As of 2008 the closed captioning industry in Israel is on the rise since a law has been approved, stating that all the Hebrew programmes of The Israeli Television must be subtitled for the hearing impaired. Moreover, in recent years it became a norm in other channels and broadcasting bodies in Israel)\n* [[Japan]] (side-by-side with dubs)\n* [[Latvia]] (Subtitles in [[Latvian language|Latvian]], occasionally in Latvian language shows or simply in [[Russian language|Russian]] language channels in Russian)\n* [[Malaysia]] (Subtitles in Malay for programming in English and vernacular languages such as Chinese and Tamil and foreign languages such as Hindi and Korean except certain programmes dubbed into Malay such as anime, news programmes in respective vernacular languages (news reports in vernacular language news programmes with foreign people speaking are translated in subtitles) and certain Malay-language live action programs subtitled in English. Also appearing for programming in Indonesian since 2006 except for news reports in Malay news programmes that have Indonesian people speaking where they are not subtitled. All movies on 35&nbsp;mm film subtitled in Malay and Simplified Chinese. Usually, animation and 3D movies are exempted from subtitling (though studios may choose to add subtitles at their discretion). Indian and Chinese movies usually have subtitles of more than one languages)\n* [[Montenegro]] (Subtitles in Montenegrin, children's shows dubbed in Serbian; Serbian subtitles imported frequently)\n* [[Myanmar]] (Subtitles in Burmese, typically in Non-Burmese children's programming and anime, dubbing rarely used)\n* [[Netherlands]] (Subtitles in Dutch, children's shows are dubbed)\n* [[North Macedonia]] (Children's program dubbed in Macedonian or Serbian, everything other subtitled in Macedonian)\n* [[Norway]] (Subtitles in Norwegian. Television programming and motion pictures directed towards children are dubbed, although cinemas often offer subtitled late-evening screenings of the latter. The off-screen narration in documentaries may be dubbed, although on-screen dialogue are always subtitled)\n* [[Peru]] (in [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Quechua languages|Quechua]])\n* [[Philippines]] (some Filipino films were all subtitled in English, but all foreign television programs were dubbed in Filipino.)\n* [[Poland]] (almost all live-action movies in cinemas are subtitled; some movies can be found in two versions, with subtitles and dubbing)\n* [[Portugal]] (Most shows are subtitled in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], but children's shows and documentaries are usually dubbed)\n* [[Romania]] (Subtitles in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], no series dubbed)\n* [[Serbia]] (All children's shows and teleshopping are dubbed, everything else is subtitled in Serbian)\n* [[Slovenia]] (Children's shows are dubbed, everything else is subtitled in Slovenian)\n* [[Singapore]] in English, Chinese and Malay, with some subtitling bilingual in either Chinese and English or Chinese and Malay\n* [[South Africa]] (from [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], [[Sesotho language|Sesotho]], [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and [[Zulu language|Zulu]] into [[English language|English]])\n* [[South Korea]] (Subtitles in [[Korean language|Korean]], no series dubbed)\n* [[Sweden]] (Subtitles in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. Television programming and motion pictures directed towards children are dubbed, although cinemas often offer subtitled late-evening screenings of the latter. The off-screen narration in documentaries may be dubbed, although on-screen dialogue are always subtitled)\n* [[Taiwan]] (Mandarin subtitles appear on most shows and all news or live action broadcasts)\n* [[Turkey]] (Ethnical languages of the country in [[TRT 3]])\n* [[Ukraine]] (TV shows in Russian are often shown with [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] subtitles)\n* [[United Kingdom]]\n* [[United States]]\n* [[Uruguay]] (cable/satellite TV only)\n* [[Venezuela]] (cable/satellite TV only)\n\nIt is also common that television services in minority languages subtitle their programs in the dominant language as well. Examples include the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] [[S4C]] and [[Irish language|Irish]] [[TG4]] who subtitle in [[English language|English]] and the [[Swedish language|Swedish]] [[Yle Fem]] in Finland who subtitle in the majority language [[Finnish language|Finnish]].\n\nIn [[Wallonia]] (Belgium) films are usually dubbed, but sometimes they are played on two channels at the same time: one dubbed (on La Une) and the other subtitled (on La Deux), but this is no longer done as frequently due to low ratings.\n\nIn Australia, one [[free-to-air|FTA]] network, [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] airs its foreign-language shows subtitled in English.\n\n== Categories ==\nSubtitles in the same language on the same production can be in different categories:\n* '''Hearing Impaired''' subtitles (sometimes abbreviated as HI or [[Subtitles#Subtitles for the deaf or hard-of-hearing (SDH)|SDH]]) are intended for people who are hearing impaired, providing information about music, environmental sounds and off-screen speakers (e.g. when a doorbell rings or a gunshot is heard). In other words, they indicate the kinds and the sources of the sounds coming from the movie, and usually put this information inside brackets to demarcate it from actors' dialogs. For example: [sound of typing on a keyboard], [mysterious music], [glass breaks], [woman screaming].\n* '''Narrative''' is the most common type of subtitle in which spoken dialogue is displayed. These are most commonly used to translate a film with one spoken language and the text of a second language.\n* '''Forced''' subtitles are common on movies and only provide subtitles when the characters speak a foreign or [[alien language]], or a sign, flag, or other text in a scene is not translated in the localization and dubbing process. In some cases, foreign dialogue may be left untranslated if the movie is meant to be seen from the point of view of a particular character who does not speak the language in question. For example, in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Amistad (film)|Amistad]]'' the dialogue of the Spanish slave traders is subtitled, while African languages are left untranslated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/missing-heaven-making-hell|title=MISSING HEAVEN, MAKING HELL|date=1998-01-05|website=Washington Examiner|language=en|access-date=2019-11-24}}</ref>\n* '''Content''' subtitles are a North American Secondary Industry (non-Hollywood, often low-budget) staple. They add content dictation that is missing from filmed action or dialogue. Due to the general low-budget allowances in such films, it is often more feasible to add the overlay subtitles to fill in information. They are most commonly seen on America's Maverick films as forced subtitles, and on Canada's MapleLeaf films as optional subtitles. Content subtitles also appear in the beginning of some higher-budget films (e.g., [[Star Wars]]) or at the end of a film (e.g., [[Gods and Generals (film)|Gods and Generals]]).\n* '''Titles only''' are typically used by dubbed programs and provide only the text for any untranslated on-screen text. They are most commonly forced (see above).\n* '''Bonus''' subtitles are an additional set of text blurbs that are added to DVDs. They are similar to [[Blu-ray Disc]]s' in-movie content or to the \"info nuggets\" in VH1 [[Pop-up Video]]. Often shown in popup or balloon form, they point out background, behind-the-scenes information relative to what is appearing on screen, often indicating filming and performance mistakes in continuity or consistency.\n* '''Localized''' subtitles are a separate subtitle track that uses expanded references (i.e., \"The sake [a Japanese Wine] was excellent as was the Wasabi\") or can replace the standardized subtitle track with a [[language localization|localized]] form replacing references to local custom (i.e., from above, \"The wine was excellent as was the spicy dip\").\n* '''Extended/Expanded''' subtitles combine the standard subtitle track with the localization subtitle track. Originally found only on Celestial DVDs in the early 2000s, the format has expanded to many export-intended releases from China, Japan, India, and Taiwan. The term \"Expanded Subtitles\" is owned by Celestial, with \"Extended Subtitles\" being used by other companies.\n* '''3D''' subtitles combine the standard subtitle position along the X and Y axis of the picture, with a third position along the Z-axis.  This third positioning allows the subtitle to \"float\" in front of the 3D image.  This option is available in Digital Cinema and in 3D Blu-ray releases.\n\n== Types ==\nSubtitles exist in two forms; '''open''' subtitles are 'open to all' and cannot be turned off by the viewer; '''closed''' subtitles are designed for a certain group of viewers, and can usually be turned on/off or selected by the viewer \u2013 examples being teletext pages, US Closed captions (608/708), DVB Bitmap subtitles, DVD/Blu-ray subtitles.\n\nWhile distributing content, subtitles can appear in one of 3 types:\n* '''Hard''' (also known as '''hardsubs''' or '''open''' subtitles). The subtitle text is irreversibly merged in original video frames, and so no special equipment or software is required for playback. Hence, complex transition effects and animation can be implemented, such as [[karaoke]] song lyrics using various colors, fonts, sizes, animation (like a [[bouncing ball (music)|bouncing ball]]) etc. to follow the lyrics. However, these subtitles cannot be turned off unless the original video is also included in the distribution as they are now part of the original frame, and thus it is impossible to have several variants of subtitling, such as in multiple languages.\n* '''Prerendered''' (also known as '''closed''') subtitles are separate video frames that are overlaid on the original video stream while playing. Prerendered subtitles are used on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] (though they are contained in the same file as the video stream). It is possible to turn them off or have multiple language subtitles and switch among them, but the player has to support such subtitles to display them. Also, subtitles are usually encoded as images with minimal bitrate and number of colors; they usually lack [[Spatial anti-aliasing|anti-aliased]] [[font rasterization]]. Also, changing such subtitles is hard, but special [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] software, such as [[SubRip]] exists to convert such subtitles to \"soft\" ones.\n* '''Soft''' (also known as '''softsubs''' or '''closed''' subtitles) are separate instructions, usually a specially marked up text with time stamps to be displayed during playback. It requires player support and, moreover, there are multiple incompatible (but usually reciprocally convertible) subtitle file formats. Softsubs are relatively easy to create and change, and thus are frequently used for [[fansub]]s. Text rendering quality can vary depending on the player, but is generally higher than prerendered subtitles. Also, some formats introduce [[text encoding]] troubles for the end-user, especially if different languages are used simultaneously (for example, Latin and Asian scripts).\n\nIn other categorization, digital video subtitles are sometimes called '''internal''', if they are embedded in a single video file container along with video and audio streams, and '''external''' if they are distributed as separate file (that is less convenient, but it is easier to edit/change such file).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+'''Comparison table'''\n!

However, there are occasions when foreign dialogue is left unsubtitled (and thus incomprehensible to most of the target audience). This is often done if the movie is seen predominantly from the viewpoint of a particular character who does not speak the language. Such absence of subtitles allows the audience to feel a similar sense of incomprehension and [[Social alienation|alienation]] that the character feels. An example of this is seen in ''[[Not Without My Daughter (film)|Not Without My Daughter]]''. The [[Persian language]] dialogue spoken by the Iranian characters is not subtitled because the main character [[Betty Mahmoody]] does not speak Persian and the audience is seeing the film from her viewpoint.\n\nA variation of this was used in the video game ''[[Max Payne 3]]''. Subtitles are used on both the English and Portuguese dialogues, but the latter is left untranslated<ref name=\"maxpayne3subtitles\">{{cite web|url=http://www.entdepot.com/2012/06/01/xbox-360-review-max-payne-3/|title=(Xbox 360 Review) Max Payne 3 |publisher=The Entertainment Depot|accessdate=7 May 2013}}</ref> as the main character doesn't understand the language.\n\n== Subtitles as a source of humor ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2011}}\nOccasionally, movies will use subtitles as a source of humor, parody and satire.\n* In ''[[Annie Hall]]'', the characters of [[Woody Allen]] and [[Diane Keaton]] are having a conversation; their real thoughts are shown in subtitles.\n* In ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'', [[Japanese language|Japanese]] dialog is subtitled using white type that blends in with white objects in the background. An example is when white binders turn the subtitle \"I have a huge rodent problem\" into \"I have a huge rod.\" After many cases of this, Mr. Roboto says \"Why don't I just speak English?\", in English. In the same film, Austin and Nigel Powers directly speak in [[Cockney English]] to make the content of their conversation unintelligible; subtitles appear for the first part of the conversation, but then cease and are replaced with a series of question marks.\n* In ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'', the Beatles use the subtitles of \"[[All you need is love]]\" to defeat a giant glove.\n* In ''[[The Impostors]]'', one character speaks in a foreign language, while another character hides under the bed. Although the hidden character cannot understand what is being spoken, he can read the subtitles. Since the subtitles are overlaid on the film, they appear to be reversed from his point of view. His attempt to puzzle out these subtitles enhances the humor of the scene.\n* The movie ''[[Airplane!]]'' and its sequel feature two inner-city [[African American]]s speaking in heavily accented slang, which another character refers to as if it were a foreign language: \"[[African American Vernacular English|Jive]]\".  Subtitles translate their speech, which is full of colorful expressions and mild profanity, into bland [[standard English]], but the typical viewer can understand enough of what they are saying to recognize the incongruity. [https://web.archive.org/web/20040528112358/http://larry.teamoverkill.com/jive/ Transcript of the dialog]\n* In ''[[Cars 2]]'', Susie Chef and Mater speak Chinese with English subtitles and Luigi, Mama Lopolino and Uncle Topolino speak Italian with English subtitles.\n* In parodies of the German film ''[[Downfall (2004 film)|Der Untergang]]'', incorrect subtitles are deliberately used, often with offensive and humorous results.\n* In the [[Carl Reiner]] comedy ''[[The Man with Two Brains]]'', after stopping Dr. Michael Hfuhruhurr ([[Steve Martin]]) for speeding, a German police officer realizes that Hfuhruhurr can speak English. He asks his colleague in their squad car to turn off the subtitles, and indicates toward the bottom of the screen, commenting that \"This is better&nbsp;\u2014 we have more room down there now\".\n* In the opening credits of ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'', the Swedish subtitler switches to English and promotes his country, until the introduction is cut off and the subtitler \"sacked\".  In the DVD version of the same film, the viewer could choose, instead of hearing aid and local languages, lines from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Henry IV, part 2]]'' that vaguely resemble the lines that are actually being spoken in film, if they are \"''people who hate the film''\".\n* In ''[[Scary Movie 4]]'', there is a scene where the actors speak in faux [[Japanese language|Japanese]] (nonsensical words which mostly consist of Japanese company names), but the content of the subtitles is the \"real\" conversation.\n* In ''[[Not Another Teen Movie]]'', the nude [[foreign exchange student]] character Areola speaks lightly accented English, but her dialog is subtitled anyway. Also, the text is spaced in such a way that a view of her bare breasts is unhindered.\n* In ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]'', the leading characters have a conversation in a crowded club. To understand what is being said, the entire dialog is subtitled.\n* [[Simon Ellis (film director)|Simon Ellis]]' 2000 short film ''Telling Lies'' juxtaposes a soundtrack of a man telling lies on the telephone against subtitles which expose the truth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/filmnetwork/A7079510|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831221429/http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/filmnetwork/A7079510|url-status=dead|title=BBC \u2013 Film Network<!-- Bot generated title -->|archive-date=August 31, 2006}}</ref>\n* [[Animutation]]s commonly use subtitles to present the comical [[mondegreen|\"fake lyrics\"]] (English words that sound close to what is actually being sung in the song in the non-English language). These fake lyrics are a major staple of the Animutation genre.\n* ''[[Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels]]'' contains a scene spoken entirely in [[cockney rhyming slang]] that is subtitled in standard English.\n* In an episode of ''[[Angry Beavers]]'', at one point Norbert begins to speak with such a heavy European accent that his words are subtitled on the bottom of the screen. Daggett actually touches the subtitles, shoving them out of the way.\n* In the American theatrical versions of [[Night Watch (2004 film)|''Night Watch'']] and ''[[Day Watch (film)|Day Watch]]'', Russian dialogues are translated by subtitles which are designed accordingly to the depicted events. For instance, subtitles dissolve in water like blood, tremble along with a shaking floor or get cut by sword.\n* The film ''[[Crank (film)|Crank]]'' contains a scene where [[Jason Statham]]'s character understands an Asian character's line of dialogue from reading the on-screen subtitle. The subtitle is even in reverse when his character reads the line. Later, an exclamation made by another Asian character is subtitled, but both the spoken words and the subtitles are in Chinese.\n* In ''[[Fatal Instinct]]'', also directed by [[Carl Reiner]], one scene involving two characters talking about their murder plan in Yiddish to prevent anyone from knowing about it, only to be foiled by a man on the bench reading the on-screen subtitles.\n* [[Ken Loach]] released the film ''[[Riff-Raff (1991 film)|Riff-Raff]]'' into American theatres with subtitles not only so people could understand the thick Scottish accents, but also to make fun of what he believes to be many Americans' need for them (mentioned in the theatrical trailer). Many of Loach's films contain traditional dialect, with some (e.g. ''[[The Price of Coal]]'') requiring subtitles even when shown on television in England.\n* In [[Bobby Lee]]'s \"Tae Do,\" a [[parody]] of Korean dramas in a ''[[Mad TV]]'' episode, the subtitles make more sense of the story than the Korean language being spoken.  The subtitles are made to appear as though written by someone with a poor understanding of grammar and are often intentionally made longer than what they actually say in the drama. For example, an actor says \"Sarang\" (\"I love you\"), but the subtitle is  so long that it covers the whole screen.\n* In television series [[Skithouse]], a journalist interviews a group of Afghan terrorists in English, but one of them gets subtitled and sees it. He gets mad because he takes as an insult that he is the only one to get subtitled.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFPm2fhB2pI|title=Skithouse: News report from Iraq|date=5 August 2007|work=YouTube}}</ref>\n* In [[Mel Brooks]] film ''[[Men in Tights]]'', the thoughts of Broomhilde's (Megan Cavanaugh) horse [[Farfelkugel]] are shown as subtitles when Broomhilde attempts to jump on saddle off balcony. As Farfelkugel shudders, the showtitles show \"She must be kidding!\"\n* In the television series ''[[Drawn Together]]'', the character Ling-Ling can only be understood through English subtitles, as his dialogue is delivered in a nonexistent language referred to as \"Japorean\" by [[Abbey DiGregorio]], the voice actress for the character.\n* In the television series ''[[Green Acres]]'' episode \u201cLisa's Mudder Comes for a Visit\u201d (season 5 episode 1), Lisa and her mother converse in Hungarian, with English Subtitles.  First, Lisa looks down and corrects the subtitles, \u201cNo no no, I said you hadn't changed a bit! We have a lot of trouble here with subtitles.\u201d, and they change.  Mother's Japanese chauffeur asks \u201cI begga pardon \u2013 I bringa bags inna house?\u201d that elicits a gong sound and Japanese subtitles. This is followed by Mother's great Dane barking with the subtitles \u201cI've seen better doghouses than this\u201d with Lisa responding \u201cWe're not interested in what the dog says\u201d, and the subtitles disappear. Later, the subtitles ask farmhand Eb if they will be needing any more subtitles for the episode.\n* In the UK television series ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', in episode 6 of Series 13, they purposely mistranslate the song sung by [[Carla Bruni]], having her supposedly denouncing hatred towards the trio of presenters (\"but mainly [[James May]]\") for destroying what is claimed to be her own [[Morris Marina]].\n* In Vance Joy's music video \"Riptide\" it shows a woman singing the lyrics to the song. At many points the lyrics which are sung \"I got a lump in my throat cause you're gonna sing the words wrong\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/riptide-lyrics-vance-joy.html|title=Vance Joy \u2013 Riptide Lyrics \u2013 MetroLyrics|work=metrolyrics.com}}</ref> are deliberately mis-subtitled as \"I got a lump in my throat cause you gone and sank the worlds wolf\"<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJ_1HMAGb4k|title=Vance Joy \u2013 'Riptide' Official Video|date=2 April 2013|work=YouTube}}</ref>\n* In [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]]'s music video for \"[[Smells Like Nirvana]]\", the second verse is subtitled as a way to mock the supposed unintelligibility of the song. One of the lines is \"It's hard to bargle nawdle zouss???\" (with three question marks), which has no meaning, but is explained by the following line, \"With all these marbles in my mouth\". While singing the latter, Yankovic indeed spits out a couple of marbles.\n\nOne unintentional source of humor in subtitles comes from illegal DVDs produced in non-English-speaking countries (especially China).  These DVDs often contain poorly worded subtitle tracks, possibly produced by [[machine translation]], with humorous results.  One of the better-known examples is a copy of ''[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith]]'' whose opening title was subtitled, \"Star war: The backstroke of the west\".<ref>{{cite web|title=episode iii, the backstroke of the west|url=http://winterson.com/2005/06/episode-iii-backstroke-of-west.html|work=winterson.com|publisher=Google, Inc|access-date=10 March 2013|author=jeremy|date=6 July 2005|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516224348/http://www.winterson.com/2005/06/episode-iii-backstroke-of-west.html|archive-date=16 May 2008|df=}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col |colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Airscript]]\n* [[Camtasia]]\n* [[Comparison of subtitle editors]]\n* [[Comparison of video player software#Subtitle ability|Comparison of software video players with subtitle support]]\n* [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|Dubbing]]\n* [[Interactive transcripts]]\n* [[Intertitle]]\n* [[Karaoke]]\n* [[Kameraflage]]\n* [[Subtitle editor]]\n* [[Surtitles]]\n* [[Same language subtitling]]\n* [[Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language]]\n* [[Telop]]\n* [[Time shifting]]\n* [[Transcription (linguistics)]]\n* [[WYSIWYG]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\nMany words such as \"Mum/Mom\", \"pyjamas/pajamas\", and so on, are commonly spelled according to the accent or national origin of the person speaking, rather than the language, country, or market the subtitles were created for.  For example, a British film released in the United States might use \"Mum\" when a British character is speaking, while using \"Mom\" when an American character is speaking.\n\n'''Phone captioning''' is a free service provided by the US government in which specially trained operators provide transcriptions for hearing-impaired telephone users.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n<!--===============({{NoMoreLinks}})===============-->\n<!-- DO NOT ADD MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

They can either be a form of written [[translation]] of a dialog in a foreign language, or a written rendering of the dialog in the same language, with or without added information to help viewers who are [[deaf]] or [[hard of hearing]] to follow the dialog, or people who cannot understand the spoken dialogue or who have accent recognition problems.\n\nThe encoded method can either be pre-rendered with the video or separate as either a graphic or text to be rendered and overlaid by the receiver.  The separate subtitles are used for [[DVD]], [[Blu-ray]] and television [[teletext]]/[[Digital Video Broadcasting]] (DVB) subtitling or [[EIA-608]] captioning, which are hidden unless requested by the viewer from a menu or remote controller key or by selecting the relevant page or service (e.g., p.&nbsp;888 or CC1), always carry additional sound representations for deaf and hard of hearing viewers. Teletext subtitle language follows the original audio, except in multi-lingual countries where the broadcaster may provide subtitles in additional languages on other teletext pages.  EIA-608 captions are similar, except that North American Spanish stations may provide captioning in Spanish on CC3. DVD and Blu-ray only differ in using [[run-length]] encoded graphics instead of text, as well as some HD DVB broadcasts.\n\nSometimes, mainly at [[film festival]]s, subtitles may be shown on a separate display below the screen, thus saving the film-maker from creating a subtitled copy for perhaps just one showing. Television subtitling for the deaf and hard of hearing is also referred to as [[closed captioning]] in some countries.\n\nMore exceptional uses also include operas, such as Verdi's Aida, where sung lyrics in Italian are subtitled in English or in another local language outside the stage area on luminous screens for the audience to follow the storyline, or on a screen attached to the back of the chairs in front of the audience.\n\nThe word ''subtitle'' is the prefix ''sub-'' (\"below\") followed by ''title''. In some cases, such as live [[opera]], the dialog is displayed above the stage in what are referred to as ''[[surtitles]]'' (''sur-'' meaning \"above\").\n\n== Creation, delivery and display of subtitles ==\n\nToday, professional subtitlers usually work with specialized computer software and hardware where the video is digitally stored on a hard disk, making each individual frame instantly accessible. Besides creating the subtitles, the subtitler usually also tells the computer software the exact positions where each subtitle should appear and disappear. For cinema film, this task is traditionally done by separate technicians. The end result is a subtitle file containing the actual subtitles as well as position markers indicating where each subtitle should appear and disappear. These markers are usually based on [[SMPTE time code|timecode]] if it is a work for electronic media (e.g., TV, video, DVD), or on film length (measured in feet and frames) if the subtitles are to be used for traditional cinema film.\n\nThe finished subtitle file is used to add the subtitles to the picture, either:\n* directly into the picture (open subtitles);\n* embedded in the [[vertical interval]] and later superimposed on the picture by the end user with the help of an external decoder or a decoder built into the TV (closed subtitles on TV or video);\n* or converted (rendered) to [[Tagged Image File Format|tiff]] or [[BMP file format|bmp]] graphics that are later superimposed on the picture by the end user's equipment (closed subtitles on DVD or as part of a DVB broadcast).\n\nSubtitles can also be created by individuals using freely available subtitle-creation software like [[Subtitle Workshop]] for Windows, [[MovieCaptioner]] for Mac/Windows, and [[Subtitle Composer]] for Linux, and then hardcode them onto a video file with programs such as [[VirtualDub]] in combination with [[VSFilter]] which could also be used to show subtitles as softsubs in many [[Video player (software)|software video players]].\n\nFor multimedia-style [[Webcasting]], check:\n* SMIL [[Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language]];\n* [[Timed Text]] [[DFXP]].\n\n==Automatic captioning==\nSome programs and online software allow automatic captions, mainly using [[speech-to-text]] features.\n\nFor example, in [[YouTube]],  automatic captions are available in English, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. If automatic captions are available for the language, they will automatically be published on the video.<ref>[https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6373554?hl=en Use automatic captioning], [[YouTube]].</ref>\n\n== Same-language captions ==\nSame-language captions, i.e., without translation, were primarily intended as an aid for people who are deaf or hard of hearing. Internationally, there are several major studies which demonstrate that same-language captioning can have a major impact on literacy and reading growth across a broad range of reading abilities.<ref name=AshokaBrij>''[http://www.ashoka.org/fellow/3557 Brij Kothari] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828182628/http://www.ashoka.org/fellow/3557 |date=2008-08-28 }}'' from  [http://www.ashoka.org/ Ashoka.org].

This idea was struck upon by [[Brij Kothari]], who believed that SLS makes reading practice an incidental, automatic, and subconscious part of popular TV entertainment, at a low per-person cost to shore up [[Literacy in India|literacy rates in India]].\n\n=== Same-language subtitling ===\n[[Same language subtitling]] (SLS) is the use of synchronized captioning of musical lyrics (or any text with an audio/video source) as a repeated reading activity. The basic reading activity involves students viewing a short subtitled presentation projected onscreen, while completing a response worksheet. To be really effective, the subtitling should have high quality synchronization of audio and text, and better yet, subtitling should change color in syllabic synchronization to audio model, and the text should be at a level to challenge students' language abilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://go.editlib.org/p/27350|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709105516/http://go.editlib.org/p/27350|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-07-09|title=McCall, W.

These are a transcription rather than a translation, and usually contain descriptions of important non-dialog audio as well such as \"(SIGHS)\", \"(WIND HOWLING)\", \"(\"SONG TITLE\" PLAYING)\", \"(KISSES)\", \"(THUNDER RUMBLING)\" or \"(DOOR CREAKING)\" and lyrics. From the expression \"closed captions\" the word \"caption\" has in recent years come to mean a subtitle intended for the deaf or hard of hearing, be it \"open\" or \"closed\". In British English \"subtitles\" usually refers to subtitles for the  deaf or hard of hearing (SDH); however, the term \"SDH\" is sometimes used when there is a need to make a distinction between the two.\n\n==== Real time ====\nPrograms such as news bulletins, current affairs programs, sport, some talk shows and political and special events utilize real time or online captioning.<ref name=\"dcita\">{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.dcita.gov.au/media_broadcasting/consultation_and_submissions/captioning_standards_review/submissions_to_the_captioning_standards_review\n |title        = Submissions to the captioning standards review &#124; Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts\n |access-date   = 2007-04-04\n |author1      = Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts\n |authorlink1  = Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Australia)\n |author2      = [http://www.auscap.com.au/ Australian Caption Centre]\n |date         = 1999-02-26\n |format       = [[Microsoft Word]]\n |quote        = [http://www.dcita.gov.au/__data/assets/word_doc/10835/Australian_Caption_Centre.doc Australian Caption Centre]\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070908193257/http://www.dcita.gov.au/media_broadcasting/consultation_and_submissions/captioning_standards_review/submissions_to_the_captioning_standards_review#\n |archive-date = 2007-09-08\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           =\n}}</ref> Live captioning is increasingly common, especially in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]], as a result of regulations that stipulate that virtually all TV eventually must be accessible for people who are deaf and hard\u2013of\u2013hearing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ncicap.org/caphist.asp |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-04-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719060406/http://www.ncicap.org/caphist.asp |archive-date=2011-07-19 |df= }}</ref> In practice, however, these \"real time\" subtitles will typically lag the audio by several seconds due to the inherent delay in transcribing, encoding, and transmitting the subtitles. Real time subtitles are also challenged by typographic errors or mis-hearing of the spoken words, with no time available to correct before transmission.\n\n===== Pre-prepared =====\nSome programs may be prepared in their entirety several hours before broadcast, but with insufficient time to prepare a timecoded caption file for automatic play-out. Pre-prepared captions look similar to offline captions, although the accuracy of cueing may be compromised slightly as the captions are not locked to program timecode.<ref name=\"dcita\" />\n\nNewsroom captioning involves the automatic transfer of text from the newsroom computer system to a device which outputs it as captions. It does work, but its suitability as an exclusive system would only apply to programs which had been scripted in their entirety on the newsroom computer system, such as short interstitial updates.<ref name=\"dcita\" />\n\nIn the United States and Canada, some broadcasters have used it exclusively and simply left uncaptioned sections of the bulletin for which a script was unavailable.<ref name=\"dcita\" /> Newsroom captioning limits captions to pre-scripted materials and, therefore, does not cover 100% of the news, weather and sports segments of a typical local news broadcast which are typically not pre-scripted, last-second breaking news or changes to the scripts, ad lib conversations of the broadcasters, emergency or other live remote broadcasts by reporters in-the-field. By failing to cover items such as these, newsroom style captioning (or use of the [[Teleprompter]] for captioning) typically results in coverage of less than 30% of a local news broadcast.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.captioncolorado.com/about/index.html\n| title = Caption Colorado\n| accessdate = 2007-10-24\n| author = [http://www.captioncolorado.com/about/index.html Caption Colorado]\n| year = 2002\n| quote=\"Real-time\" vs. Newsroom Captioning<br /> Caption Colorado offers \"real-time\" closed captioning that utilizes unique technologies coupled with the talents of highly skilled captioners who use stenographic court reporting machines to transcribe the audio on the fly, as the words are spoken by the broadcasters. real-time captioning is not limited to pre-scripted materials and, therefore, covers 100% of the news, weather and sports segments of a typical local news broadcast. It will cover such things as the weather and sports segments which are typically not pre-scripted, last second breaking news or changes to the scripts, ad lib conversations of the broadcasters, emergency or other live remote broadcasts by reporters in the field.

Speech recognition technology has advanced so quickly in the United States that about 50% of all live captioning was through speech recognition as of 2005.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Real-time captions look different from offline captions, as they are presented as a continuous flow of text as people speak.<ref name=\"dcita\" />{{clarify|date=November 2011}}\n\nStenography is a system of rendering words phonetically, and English, with its multitude of homophones (e.g., there, their, they're), is particularly unsuited to easy transcriptions. Stenographers working in courts and inquiries usually have 24 hours in which to deliver their transcripts. Consequently, they may enter the same phonetic stenographic codes for a variety of homophones, and fix up the spelling later. Real-time stenographers must deliver their transcriptions accurately and immediately. They must therefore develop techniques for keying homophones differently, and be unswayed by the pressures of delivering accurate product on immediate demand.<ref name=\"dcita\" />\n\nSubmissions to recent captioning-related inquiries have revealed concerns from broadcasters about captioning sports. Captioning sports may also affect many different people because of the weather outside of it. In much sport captioning's absence, the Australian Caption Centre submitted to the National Working Party on Captioning (NWPC), in November 1998, three examples of sport captioning, each performed on tennis, rugby league and swimming programs:\n* Heavily reduced: Captioners ignore commentary and provide only scores and essential information such as \"try\" or \"out\".\n* Significantly reduced: Captioners use [[QWERTY]] input to type summary captions yielding the essence of what the commentators are saying, delayed due to the limitations of QWERTY input.\n* Comprehensive realtime: Captioners use stenography to caption the commentary in its entirety.<ref name=\"dcita\" />\n\nThe NWPC concluded that the standard they accept is the comprehensive real-time method, which gives them access to the commentary in its entirety. Also, not all sports are live.  Many events are pre-recorded hours before they are broadcast, allowing a captioner to caption them using offline methods.<ref name=\"dcita\" />\n\n===== Hybrid =====\nBecause different programs are produced under different conditions, a case-by-case basis must consequently determine captioning methodology. Some bulletins may have a high incidence of truly live material, or insufficient access to video feeds and scripts may be provided to the captioning facility, making stenography unavoidable. Other bulletins may be pre-recorded just before going to air, making pre-prepared text preferable.<ref name=\"dcita\" />\n\nNews captioning applications currently available are designed to accept text from a variety of inputs: stenography, Velotype, QWERTY, [[ASCII]] import, and the newsroom computer. This allows one facility to handle a variety of online captioning requirements and to ensure that captioners properly caption all programs.<ref name=\"dcita\" />\n\nCurrent affairs programs usually require stenographic assistance. Even though the segments which comprise a current affairs program may be produced in advance, they are usually done so just before on-air time and their duration makes QWERTY input of text unfeasible.<ref name=\"dcita\" />\n\nNews bulletins, on the other hand, can often be captioned without stenographic input (unless there are live crosses or ad-libbing by the presenters).  This is because:\n* Most items are scripted on the newsroom computer system and this text can be electronically imported into the captioning system.\n* Individual news stories are of short duration, so even if they are made available only just prior to broadcast, there is still time to use QWERTY in text.<ref name=\"dcita\" />\n\n==== Offline ====\nFor non-live, or pre-recorded programs, television program providers can choose offline captioning. Captioners gear offline captioning toward the high-end television industry, providing highly customized captioning features, such as pop-on style captions, specialized screen placement, speaker identifications, italics, special characters, and sound effects.<ref name=\"Offline\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.captioncolorado.com/products/offline.html\n| title = Caption Colorado\n| accessdate = 2007-10-24\n| author = [http://www.captioncolorado.com/about/index.html Caption Colorado]\n| year = 2002\n| quote = Offline Captioning<br /> For non-live, or pre-recorded programs, you can choose from two presentation styles models for offline captioning or transcription needs in English or Spanish.<br /> <br /> Premiere Offline Captioning<br /> Premiere Offline Captioning is geared toward the high-end television industry, providing highly customized captioning features, such as pop-on style captions, specialized screen placement, speaker identifications, italics, special characters, and sound effects.<br /> <br /> Premiere Offline involves a five-step design and editing process, and does much more than simply display the text of a program.

It refers to regular subtitles in the original language where important non-dialog information has been added, as well as speaker identification, which may be useful when the viewer cannot otherwise visually tell who is saying what.\n\nThe only significant difference for the user between SDH subtitles and closed captions is their appearance: SDH subtitles usually are displayed with the same proportional font used for the translation subtitles on the DVD; however, closed captions are displayed as white text on a black band, which blocks a large portion of the view. Closed captioning is falling out of favor as many users have no difficulty reading SDH subtitles, which are text with contrast outline. In addition, DVD subtitles can specify many colors, on the same character: primary, outline, shadow, and background. This allows subtitlers to display subtitles on a usually translucent band for easier reading; however, this is rare, since most subtitles use an outline and shadow instead, in order to block a smaller portion of the picture. Closed captions may still supersede DVD subtitles, since many SDH subtitles present all of the text centered, while closed captions usually specify position on the screen: centered, left align, right align, top, etc. This is helpful for speaker identification and overlapping conversation. Some SDH  subtitles (such as the subtitles of newer [[Universal Studios]] DVDs/Blu-ray Discs) do have positioning, but it is not as common.\n\nDVDs for the U.S. market now sometimes have three forms of English subtitles: SDH subtitles; English subtitles, helpful for viewers who may not be hearing impaired but whose first language may not be English (although they are usually an exact transcript and not simplified); and closed caption data that is decoded by the end-user's closed caption decoder. Most anime releases in the U.S. only include as subtitles translations of the original material; therefore, SDH subtitles of English dubs (\"dubtitles\") are uncommon.\n<ref>{{cite video\n| people     = [[U.S. Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC)\n| title      = Closed Captioning and the DTV Transition\n| url        = http://www.dtv.gov/video/DTV_ASL-Part3.html\n| date       = 2008-05-01\n| format     = [[SWF|swf]]\n| location   = [[Washington, D.C.]]\n| time       = 1m58s\n| quote      = In addition to passing through closed caption signals, many converter boxes also include the ability to take over the captioning role that the tuner plays in your analog TV set.

Many [[High-definition television|HDTVs]] allow the end\u2013user to customize the captions, including the ability to remove the black band.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Example of SDH - speaker ID (Charade 1963).jpg|Example of speaker id. in SDH (voices are off-screen)\nFile:Example of SDH - non-speech information 2 (Charade 1963).jpg|Example of non-speech information in SDH (source is off-screen)\nFile:Example of SDH - non-speech information 1 (Charade 1963).jpg|Example of non-speech information in SDH (two sources: off-screen and on-screen)\nFile:Example of SDH - music description (Charade 1963).jpg|Example of music description in SDH\nFile:Example of SDH - lyrics (Charade 1963).jpg|Example of lyrics transcription in SDH\n</gallery>\n\nSong lyrics are not always captioned, as additional copyright permissions may be required to reproduce the lyrics on-screen as part of the subtitle track. In October 2015, major studios and [[Netflix]] were sued over this practice, citing claims of [[false advertising]] (as the work is henceforth not completely subtitled) and [[civil rights]] violations (under California's [[Unruh Civil Rights Act]], guaranteeing equal rights for people with disabilities). Judge [[Stephen Victor Wilson]] dismissed the suit in September 2016, ruling that allegations of civil rights violations did not present evidence of intentional discrimination against viewers with disabilities, and that allegations over misrepresenting the extent of subtitles \"fall far short of demonstrating that reasonable consumers would actually be deceived as to the amount of subtitled content provided, as there are no representations whatsoever that all song lyrics would be captioned, or even that the content would be 'fully' captioned.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2015/10/hollywood-studios-netflix-class-action-lawsuit-hearing-impaired-civil-right-violations-1201588229/|title=Hollywood Studios & Netflix Blasted For Civil Rights Violations In Song-Captioning Class Action|last=Patten|first=Dominic|date=2015-10-20|website=Deadline|language=en|access-date=2019-07-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/20/netflix-film-studios-lawsuit-song-captioning-deaf-skyfall|title=Netflix and film studios face lawsuit over song captioning for deaf|date=2015-10-20|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-07-08|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n=== Use by those not deaf or hard of hearing ===\nAlthough same-language subtitles and captions are produced primarily with the deaf and hard of hearing in mind, they may also be used to ensure understanding of dialogue (such as those spoken quietly or mixed in with sound effects, by those with accents unfamiliar to the intended audience, or supportive dialogue from background or off-screen characters). Jason Kehe of ''Wired'' noted that habitual use of subtitles by the non-deaf has been a growing trend for these reasons, and to help pick up on additional details and information found within dialogue. He drew comparisons to the ubiquity of search engines by stating that \"just like [[Google Search|Google]], closed captions are there, eminently accessible, ready to clarify the unclarities, and so, desperately, we, the paranoids and obsessive-compulsives and postmodern completists, click.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/closed-captions-everywhere/|title=The Real Reason You Use Closed Captions for Everything Now|last=Kehe|first=Jason|date=2018-06-26|work=Wired|access-date=2019-07-08|issn=1059-1028}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tv-closed-captions-movie-subtitles-benefits|title=Get Over Your Fear Of Subtitles, Please|last=Farley|first=Rebecca|website=Refinery29|language=en|access-date=2019-07-08}}</ref> Studies (including those by the [[University of Nottingham]] and the What Works Clearinghouse of the [[United States Department of Education]]) have found that use of subtitles can help promote [[reading comprehension]] in school-aged children.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2015/07/21/closed-captioning-gives-literacy-a-boost.html|title=Closed Captioning Gives Literacy a Boost|date=2015-07-21|work=Education Week|access-date=2019-07-08}}</ref>\n\n==== Asia ====\nIn some Asian television programming, captioning is considered a part of the genre, and has evolved beyond simply capturing what is being said. The captions are used artistically; it is common to see the words appear one by one as they are spoken, in a multitude of fonts, colors, and sizes that capture the spirit of what is being said. Languages like Japanese also have a rich vocabulary of [[Japanese sound symbolism|onomatopoeia]] which is used in captioning.\n\n===== East Asia =====\nIn some East Asian countries, especially Chinese-speaking ones, subtitling is common in all taped television programs. In these countries, written text remains mostly uniform while regional dialects in the spoken form can be mutually unintelligible. Therefore, subtitling offers a distinct advantage to aid comprehension. With subtitles, programs in [[Putonghua]], the standard Mandarin, or any dialect can be understood by viewers unfamiliar with it.\n\nOn-screen subtitles as seen in Japanese variety television shows are more for decorative purpose, something that is not seen in television in Europe and the Americas. Some shows even place [[sound effect]]s over those subtitles. This practice of subtitling has been spread to neighbouring countries including South Korea and Taiwan. [[Asia Television|ATV]] in Hong Kong once practiced this style of decorative subtitles on its variety shows when it was owned by [[Want Want]] Holdings in Taiwan (which also owns [[China Television|CTV]] and [[Chung T'ien Television|CTI]]).\n\n===== South Asia =====\nIn [[India]], [[Same Language Subtitling]] (SLS) are common for films and music videos. SLS refers to the idea of subtitling in the same language as the audio. SLS is highlighted [[karaoke]] style, that is, to speech. The idea of SLS was initiated to shore up literacy rates as SLS makes reading practice an incidental, automatic, and subconscious part of popular TV entertainment. This idea was well received by the [[Government of India]] which now uses SLS on several national channels, including [[Doordarshan]].<ref name=\"AshokaBrij\" /><ref name=autogenerated1>Biswas, Ranjita (2005).

Accessed on February 10, 2009</ref>\n\n== Translation ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\nTranslation basically means conversion of one language into another language in wrtten or spoken form. The process of translation requires a translator e.g. Google Translate,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://translate.google.co.in/|title=Google Translate|website=translate.google.co.in}}</ref> Microsoft Translator.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://translator.microsoft.com/|title=Break the language barrier|website=Break the language barrier &#124; Conversations}}</ref> Subtitles can be used to translate dialog from a foreign language into the native language of the audience. It is not only the quickest and cheapest method of translating content, but is also usually preferred as it is possible for the audience to hear the original dialog and voices of the actors.\n\nSubtitle translation can be different from the [[translation]] of written text. Usually, during the process of creating subtitles for a film or television program, the picture and each sentence of the audio are analyzed by the subtitle translator; also, the subtitle translator may or may not have access to a written transcript of the dialog. Especially in the field of commercial subtitles, the subtitle translator often interprets what is meant, rather than translating the manner in which the dialog is stated; that is, the meaning is more important than the form\u2014the audience does not always appreciate this, as it can be frustrating for people who are familiar with some of the spoken language; spoken language may contain verbal padding or culturally implied meanings that cannot be conveyed in the written subtitles. Also, the subtitle translator may also condense the dialog to achieve an acceptable reading speed, whereby purpose is more important than form.\n\nEspecially in [[fansub]]s, the subtitle translator may translate both form and meaning. The subtitle translator may also choose to display a note in the subtitles, usually in [[parentheses]] (\u201c[[wikt:(|(]]\u201d and \u201c[[wikt:)|)]]\u201d), or as a separate block of on-screen text\u2014this allows the subtitle translator to preserve form and achieve an acceptable reading speed; that is, the subtitle translator may leave a note on the screen, even after the character has finished speaking, to both preserve form and facilitate understanding. For example, the Japanese language has multiple first-person pronouns (see [[Japanese pronouns]]) and each pronoun is associated with a different degree of politeness. In order to compensate during the English translation process, the subtitle translator may reformulate the sentence, add appropriate words and/or use notes.\n\n=== Subtitling ===\n\n==== Real-time ====\nReal-time translation subtitling usually involves an interpreter and a stenographer working concurrently, whereby the former quickly translates to the dialog while the latter types; this form of subtitling is rare. The unavoidable delay, typing errors, lack of editing, and high cost mean that real-time translation subtitling is in low demand. Allowing the interpreter to directly speak to the viewers is usually both cheaper and quicker; however, the translation is not accessible to people who are deaf and hard-of-hearing.\n\n==== Offline ====\nSome subtitlers purposely provide edited subtitles or captions to match the needs of their audience, for learners of the spoken dialog as a second or foreign language, visual learners, beginning readers who are deaf or hard of hearing and for people with learning and/or mental disabilities. For example, for many of its films and television programs, [[PBS]] displays  standard captions representing speech the program audio, word-for-word, if the viewer selects \"CC1\" by using the television remote control or on-screen menu; however, they also provide edited captions to present simplified sentences at a slower rate, if the viewer selects \"CC2\". Programs with a diverse audience also often have captions in another language. This is common with popular Latin American [[soap opera]]s in Spanish. Since CC1 and CC2 share [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], the [[U.S. Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) recommends translation subtitles be placed in CC3. CC4, which shares bandwidth with CC3, is also available, but programs seldom use it.\n\n=== Subtitles vs. dubbing and lectoring ===\nThe two alternative methods of 'translating' films in a foreign language are [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]], in which other actors record over the voices of the original actors in a different language, and [[Voice-over translation|lectoring]], a form of [[voice-over]] for fictional material where a narrator tells the audience what the actors are saying while their voices can be heard in the background. Lectoring is common for television in Russia, Poland, and a few other East European countries, while cinemas in these countries commonly show films dubbed or subtitled.\n\nThe preference for dubbing or subtitling in various countries is largely based on decisions taken in the late 1920s and early 1930s. With the arrival of sound film, the film importers in [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[France]] and [[Spain]] decided to dub the foreign voices, while the rest of Europe elected to display the dialog as translated subtitles. The choice was largely due to financial reasons (subtitling is more economical and quicker than dubbing), but during the 1930s it also became a political preference in Germany, Italy and Spain; an expedient form of [[censorship]] that ensured that foreign views and ideas could be stopped from reaching the local audience, as dubbing makes it possible to create a dialogue which is totally different from the original. In larger German cities a few \"special cinemas\" use subtitling instead of dubbing.\n\nDubbing is still the norm and favored form in these four countries, but the proportion of subtitling is slowly growing, mainly to save cost and turnaround-time, but also due to a growing acceptance among younger generations, who are better readers and increasingly have a basic knowledge of English (the dominant language in film and TV) and thus prefer to hear the original dialogue.\n\nNevertheless, in Spain, for example, only public TV channels show subtitled foreign films, usually at late night. It is extremely rare that any Spanish TV channel shows subtitled versions of TV programs, series or documentaries. With the advent of digital land broadcast TV, it has become common practice in Spain to provide optional audio and subtitle streams that allow watching dubbed programmes with the original audio and subtitles. In addition, only a small proportion of cinemas show subtitled films. Films with dialogue in Galician, Catalan or Basque are always dubbed, not subtitled, when they are shown in the rest of the country. Some non-Spanish-speaking TV stations subtitle interviews in Spanish; others do not.\n\nIn many [[Latin America]]n countries, local network television will show dubbed versions of English-language programs and movies, while cable stations (often international) more commonly broadcast subtitled material. Preference for subtitles or dubbing varies according to individual taste and reading ability, and theaters may order two prints of the most popular films, allowing moviegoers to choose between dubbing or subtitles. Animation and children's programming, however, is nearly universally dubbed, as in other regions.\n\nSince the introduction of the DVD and, later, the Blu-ray Disc, some high budget films include the simultaneous option of ''both'' subtitles and/or dubbing. Often in such cases, the translations are made separately, rather than the subtitles being a verbatim transcript of the dubbed scenes of the film. While this allows for the smoothest possible flow of the subtitles, it can be frustrating for someone attempting to learn a foreign language.\n\nIn the traditional subtitling countries, dubbing is generally regarded as something strange and unnatural and is only used for animated films and TV programs intended for pre-school children. As animated films are \"dubbed\" even in their original language and ambient noise and effects are usually recorded on a separate sound track, dubbing a low quality production into a second language produces little or no noticeable effect on the viewing experience. In dubbed live-action television or film, however, viewers are often distracted by the fact that the audio does not match the actors' lip movements.  Furthermore, the dubbed voices may seem detached, inappropriate for the character, or overly expressive, and some ambient sounds may not be transferred to the dubbed track, creating a less enjoyable viewing experience.\n\n=== Subtitling as a practice ===\nIn several countries or regions nearly all foreign language TV programs are subtitled, instead of dubbed, notably in:\n* [[Albania]] (most all foreign-language shows are subtitled in [[Albanian language|Albanian]], children's movies and TV shows are dubbed, mostly animated)\n* [[Argentina]] (cable/satellite TV and cinemas)\n* [[Armenia]] (Subtitles in [[Armenian language|Armenian]], children's shows principally are dubbed)\n* [[Arab world|Arab Middle East and North Africa]] -- [[Modern Standard Arabic]]-language subtitling, used for foreign programming/cinema and often used when Arabic dialects are the primary medium of a film/TV program. Countries such as Lebanon, Algeria, and Morocco also often include French subtitling simultaneously.\n* [[Australia]] (especially by [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]])\n* [[Belgium]] (Subtitles in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] in [[Flanders]], dubbed into [[French language|French]] in [[Wallonia]], bilingual [Dutch-French] subtitles in Flemish and Brussels movie theaters, dubbed versions in Wallonia. Children's shows and teleshopping are dubbed)\n* [[Bolivia]]\n* [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (Children's shows are dubbed in Serbian, Croatian or Bosnian, everything else subtitled in Bosnian)\n* [[Brazil]] (some cinemas and cable channels use [[Brazilian Portuguese]] subtitles)\n* [[Chile]] (cable/satellite TV only)\n* [[China]] (Most Chinese language programming includes subtitles in Chinese, since many languages and dialects are spoken by the populace, but the writing system is independent of dialects)\n* [[Colombia]] (cable/satellite TV only)\n* [[Cuba]]\n* [[Costa Rica]] (cable/satellite TV, and on some national channels like Channel 7)\n* [[Croatia]] (Children's shows are dubbed in Croatian, everything else is subtitled in Croatian)\n* [[Denmark]] ([[Danish language|Danish]] subtitles in all foreign programmes except children's shows)\n* [[Estonia]] ([[Estonian language]] subtitles are used in foreign films and television programmes except for children's media)\n* [[Finland]] (Subtitles in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] or [[Swedish language|Swedish]], Finland is [[Languages of Finland|bilingual]]; in TV children's programs are dubbed and off-screen narration in documentaries is often dubbed)\n* [[Greece]] (only children's shows and films are dubbed)\n* [[Hong Kong]] (Dubbing in [[Cantonese]] often happens, but subtitling is also common, since these foreign programs are often broadcast in multiple languages)\n* [[Iceland]] (Subtitles in Icelandic. Television programming and motion pictures directed towards children are dubbed, although cinemas often offer subtitled late-evening screenings of the latter. The off-screen narration in documentaries may be dubbed, although on-screen dialogue are always subtitle)\n* [[India]] (Most English channels now give subtitles of their programmes in English)\n* [[Indonesia]] (Subtitles in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], some foreign movies have subtitles of more than one language)\n* [[Ireland]] (Subtitles in English for non-English programmes, including those in the [[Irish language]]. Occasional subtitles in [[Irish language]] for programmes shown on the Irish language channel: [[TG4]])\n* [[Israel]] (Non-Hebrew television programmes and films are always translated into Hebrew with subtitles. Bilingual Hebrew/Arabic or Hebrew/Russian subtitling, showing translation into both languages simultaneously, is common on public TV channels. Dubbing is restricted to programmes and films aimed at children below school age. As of 2008 the closed captioning industry in Israel is on the rise since a law has been approved, stating that all the Hebrew programmes of The Israeli Television must be subtitled for the hearing impaired. Moreover, in recent years it became a norm in other channels and broadcasting bodies in Israel)\n* [[Japan]] (side-by-side with dubs)\n* [[Latvia]] (Subtitles in [[Latvian language|Latvian]], occasionally in Latvian language shows or simply in [[Russian language|Russian]] language channels in Russian)\n* [[Malaysia]] (Subtitles in Malay for programming in English and vernacular languages such as Chinese and Tamil and foreign languages such as Hindi and Korean except certain programmes dubbed into Malay such as anime, news programmes in respective vernacular languages (news reports in vernacular language news programmes with foreign people speaking are translated in subtitles) and certain Malay-language live action programs subtitled in English. Also appearing for programming in Indonesian since 2006 except for news reports in Malay news programmes that have Indonesian people speaking where they are not subtitled. All movies on 35&nbsp;mm film subtitled in Malay and Simplified Chinese. Usually, animation and 3D movies are exempted from subtitling (though studios may choose to add subtitles at their discretion). Indian and Chinese movies usually have subtitles of more than one languages)\n* [[Montenegro]] (Subtitles in Montenegrin, children's shows dubbed in Serbian; Serbian subtitles imported frequently)\n* [[Myanmar]] (Subtitles in Burmese, typically in Non-Burmese children's programming and anime, dubbing rarely used)\n* [[Netherlands]] (Subtitles in Dutch, children's shows are dubbed)\n* [[North Macedonia]] (Children's program dubbed in Macedonian or Serbian, everything other subtitled in Macedonian)\n* [[Norway]] (Subtitles in Norwegian. Television programming and motion pictures directed towards children are dubbed, although cinemas often offer subtitled late-evening screenings of the latter. The off-screen narration in documentaries may be dubbed, although on-screen dialogue are always subtitled)\n* [[Peru]] (in [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Quechua languages|Quechua]])\n* [[Philippines]] (some Filipino films were all subtitled in English, but all foreign television programs were dubbed in Filipino.)\n* [[Poland]] (almost all live-action movies in cinemas are subtitled; some movies can be found in two versions, with subtitles and dubbing)\n* [[Portugal]] (Most shows are subtitled in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], but children's shows and documentaries are usually dubbed)\n* [[Romania]] (Subtitles in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], no series dubbed)\n* [[Serbia]] (All children's shows and teleshopping are dubbed, everything else is subtitled in Serbian)\n* [[Slovenia]] (Children's shows are dubbed, everything else is subtitled in Slovenian)\n* [[Singapore]] in English, Chinese and Malay, with some subtitling bilingual in either Chinese and English or Chinese and Malay\n* [[South Africa]] (from [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], [[Sesotho language|Sesotho]], [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and [[Zulu language|Zulu]] into [[English language|English]])\n* [[South Korea]] (Subtitles in [[Korean language|Korean]], no series dubbed)\n* [[Sweden]] (Subtitles in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. Television programming and motion pictures directed towards children are dubbed, although cinemas often offer subtitled late-evening screenings of the latter. The off-screen narration in documentaries may be dubbed, although on-screen dialogue are always subtitled)\n* [[Taiwan]] (Mandarin subtitles appear on most shows and all news or live action broadcasts)\n* [[Turkey]] (Ethnical languages of the country in [[TRT 3]])\n* [[Ukraine]] (TV shows in Russian are often shown with [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] subtitles)\n* [[United Kingdom]]\n* [[United States]]\n* [[Uruguay]] (cable/satellite TV only)\n* [[Venezuela]] (cable/satellite TV only)\n\nIt is also common that television services in minority languages subtitle their programs in the dominant language as well. Examples include the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] [[S4C]] and [[Irish language|Irish]] [[TG4]] who subtitle in [[English language|English]] and the [[Swedish language|Swedish]] [[Yle Fem]] in Finland who subtitle in the majority language [[Finnish language|Finnish]].\n\nIn [[Wallonia]] (Belgium) films are usually dubbed, but sometimes they are played on two channels at the same time: one dubbed (on La Une) and the other subtitled (on La Deux), but this is no longer done as frequently due to low ratings.\n\nIn Australia, one [[free-to-air|FTA]] network, [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] airs its foreign-language shows subtitled in English.\n\n== Categories ==\nSubtitles in the same language on the same production can be in different categories:\n* '''Hearing Impaired''' subtitles (sometimes abbreviated as HI or [[Subtitles#Subtitles for the deaf or hard-of-hearing (SDH)|SDH]]) are intended for people who are hearing impaired, providing information about music, environmental sounds and off-screen speakers (e.g. when a doorbell rings or a gunshot is heard). In other words, they indicate the kinds and the sources of the sounds coming from the movie, and usually put this information inside brackets to demarcate it from actors' dialogs. For example: [sound of typing on a keyboard], [mysterious music], [glass breaks], [woman screaming].\n* '''Narrative''' is the most common type of subtitle in which spoken dialogue is displayed. These are most commonly used to translate a film with one spoken language and the text of a second language.\n* '''Forced''' subtitles are common on movies and only provide subtitles when the characters speak a foreign or [[alien language]], or a sign, flag, or other text in a scene is not translated in the localization and dubbing process. In some cases, foreign dialogue may be left untranslated if the movie is meant to be seen from the point of view of a particular character who does not speak the language in question. For example, in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Amistad (film)|Amistad]]'' the dialogue of the Spanish slave traders is subtitled, while African languages are left untranslated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/missing-heaven-making-hell|title=MISSING HEAVEN, MAKING HELL|date=1998-01-05|website=Washington Examiner|language=en|access-date=2019-11-24}}</ref>\n* '''Content''' subtitles are a North American Secondary Industry (non-Hollywood, often low-budget) staple. They add content dictation that is missing from filmed action or dialogue. Due to the general low-budget allowances in such films, it is often more feasible to add the overlay subtitles to fill in information. They are most commonly seen on America's Maverick films as forced subtitles, and on Canada's MapleLeaf films as optional subtitles. Content subtitles also appear in the beginning of some higher-budget films (e.g., [[Star Wars]]) or at the end of a film (e.g., [[Gods and Generals (film)|Gods and Generals]]).\n* '''Titles only''' are typically used by dubbed programs and provide only the text for any untranslated on-screen text. They are most commonly forced (see above).\n* '''Bonus''' subtitles are an additional set of text blurbs that are added to DVDs. They are similar to [[Blu-ray Disc]]s' in-movie content or to the \"info nuggets\" in VH1 [[Pop-up Video]]. Often shown in popup or balloon form, they point out background, behind-the-scenes information relative to what is appearing on screen, often indicating filming and performance mistakes in continuity or consistency.\n* '''Localized''' subtitles are a separate subtitle track that uses expanded references (i.e., \"The sake [a Japanese Wine] was excellent as was the Wasabi\") or can replace the standardized subtitle track with a [[language localization|localized]] form replacing references to local custom (i.e., from above, \"The wine was excellent as was the spicy dip\").\n* '''Extended/Expanded''' subtitles combine the standard subtitle track with the localization subtitle track. Originally found only on Celestial DVDs in the early 2000s, the format has expanded to many export-intended releases from China, Japan, India, and Taiwan. The term \"Expanded Subtitles\" is owned by Celestial, with \"Extended Subtitles\" being used by other companies.\n* '''3D''' subtitles combine the standard subtitle position along the X and Y axis of the picture, with a third position along the Z-axis.  This third positioning allows the subtitle to \"float\" in front of the 3D image.  This option is available in Digital Cinema and in 3D Blu-ray releases.\n\n== Types ==\nSubtitles exist in two forms; '''open''' subtitles are 'open to all' and cannot be turned off by the viewer; '''closed''' subtitles are designed for a certain group of viewers, and can usually be turned on/off or selected by the viewer \u2013 examples being teletext pages, US Closed captions (608/708), DVB Bitmap subtitles, DVD/Blu-ray subtitles.\n\nWhile distributing content, subtitles can appear in one of 3 types:\n* '''Hard''' (also known as '''hardsubs''' or '''open''' subtitles). The subtitle text is irreversibly merged in original video frames, and so no special equipment or software is required for playback. Hence, complex transition effects and animation can be implemented, such as [[karaoke]] song lyrics using various colors, fonts, sizes, animation (like a [[bouncing ball (music)|bouncing ball]]) etc. to follow the lyrics. However, these subtitles cannot be turned off unless the original video is also included in the distribution as they are now part of the original frame, and thus it is impossible to have several variants of subtitling, such as in multiple languages.\n* '''Prerendered''' (also known as '''closed''') subtitles are separate video frames that are overlaid on the original video stream while playing. Prerendered subtitles are used on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] (though they are contained in the same file as the video stream). It is possible to turn them off or have multiple language subtitles and switch among them, but the player has to support such subtitles to display them. Also, subtitles are usually encoded as images with minimal bitrate and number of colors; they usually lack [[Spatial anti-aliasing|anti-aliased]] [[font rasterization]]. Also, changing such subtitles is hard, but special [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] software, such as [[SubRip]] exists to convert such subtitles to \"soft\" ones.\n* '''Soft''' (also known as '''softsubs''' or '''closed''' subtitles) are separate instructions, usually a specially marked up text with time stamps to be displayed during playback. It requires player support and, moreover, there are multiple incompatible (but usually reciprocally convertible) subtitle file formats. Softsubs are relatively easy to create and change, and thus are frequently used for [[fansub]]s. Text rendering quality can vary depending on the player, but is generally higher than prerendered subtitles. Also, some formats introduce [[text encoding]] troubles for the end-user, especially if different languages are used simultaneously (for example, Latin and Asian scripts).\n\nIn other categorization, digital video subtitles are sometimes called '''internal''', if they are embedded in a single video file container along with video and audio streams, and '''external''' if they are distributed as separate file (that is less convenient, but it is easier to edit/change such file).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+'''Comparison table'''\n!

However, there are occasions when foreign dialogue is left unsubtitled (and thus incomprehensible to most of the target audience). This is often done if the movie is seen predominantly from the viewpoint of a particular character who does not speak the language. Such absence of subtitles allows the audience to feel a similar sense of incomprehension and [[Social alienation|alienation]] that the character feels. An example of this is seen in ''[[Not Without My Daughter (film)|Not Without My Daughter]]''. The [[Persian language]] dialogue spoken by the Iranian characters is not subtitled because the main character [[Betty Mahmoody]] does not speak Persian and the audience is seeing the film from her viewpoint.\n\nA variation of this was used in the video game ''[[Max Payne 3]]''. Subtitles are used on both the English and Portuguese dialogues, but the latter is left untranslated<ref name=\"maxpayne3subtitles\">{{cite web|url=http://www.entdepot.com/2012/06/01/xbox-360-review-max-payne-3/|title=(Xbox 360 Review) Max Payne 3 |publisher=The Entertainment Depot|accessdate=7 May 2013}}</ref> as the main character doesn't understand the language.\n\n== Subtitles as a source of humor ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2011}}\nOccasionally, movies will use subtitles as a source of humor, parody and satire.\n* In ''[[Annie Hall]]'', the characters of [[Woody Allen]] and [[Diane Keaton]] are having a conversation; their real thoughts are shown in subtitles.\n* In ''[[Austin Powers in Goldmember]]'', [[Japanese language|Japanese]] dialog is subtitled using white type that blends in with white objects in the background. An example is when white binders turn the subtitle \"I have a huge rodent problem\" into \"I have a huge rod.\" After many cases of this, Mr. Roboto says \"Why don't I just speak English?\", in English. In the same film, Austin and Nigel Powers directly speak in [[Cockney English]] to make the content of their conversation unintelligible; subtitles appear for the first part of the conversation, but then cease and are replaced with a series of question marks.\n* In ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'', the Beatles use the subtitles of \"[[All you need is love]]\" to defeat a giant glove.\n* In ''[[The Impostors]]'', one character speaks in a foreign language, while another character hides under the bed. Although the hidden character cannot understand what is being spoken, he can read the subtitles. Since the subtitles are overlaid on the film, they appear to be reversed from his point of view. His attempt to puzzle out these subtitles enhances the humor of the scene.\n* The movie ''[[Airplane!]]'' and its sequel feature two inner-city [[African American]]s speaking in heavily accented slang, which another character refers to as if it were a foreign language: \"[[African American Vernacular English|Jive]]\".  Subtitles translate their speech, which is full of colorful expressions and mild profanity, into bland [[standard English]], but the typical viewer can understand enough of what they are saying to recognize the incongruity. [https://web.archive.org/web/20040528112358/http://larry.teamoverkill.com/jive/ Transcript of the dialog]\n* In ''[[Cars 2]]'', Susie Chef and Mater speak Chinese with English subtitles and Luigi, Mama Lopolino and Uncle Topolino speak Italian with English subtitles.\n* In parodies of the German film ''[[Downfall (2004 film)|Der Untergang]]'', incorrect subtitles are deliberately used, often with offensive and humorous results.\n* In the [[Carl Reiner]] comedy ''[[The Man with Two Brains]]'', after stopping Dr. Michael Hfuhruhurr ([[Steve Martin]]) for speeding, a German police officer realizes that Hfuhruhurr can speak English. He asks his colleague in their squad car to turn off the subtitles, and indicates toward the bottom of the screen, commenting that \"This is better&nbsp;\u2014 we have more room down there now\".\n* In the opening credits of ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'', the Swedish subtitler switches to English and promotes his country, until the introduction is cut off and the subtitler \"sacked\".  In the DVD version of the same film, the viewer could choose, instead of hearing aid and local languages, lines from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Henry IV, part 2]]'' that vaguely resemble the lines that are actually being spoken in film, if they are \"''people who hate the film''\".\n* In ''[[Scary Movie 4]]'', there is a scene where the actors speak in faux [[Japanese language|Japanese]] (nonsensical words which mostly consist of Japanese company names), but the content of the subtitles is the \"real\" conversation.\n* In ''[[Not Another Teen Movie]]'', the nude [[foreign exchange student]] character Areola speaks lightly accented English, but her dialog is subtitled anyway. Also, the text is spaced in such a way that a view of her bare breasts is unhindered.\n* In ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]'', the leading characters have a conversation in a crowded club. To understand what is being said, the entire dialog is subtitled.\n* [[Simon Ellis (film director)|Simon Ellis]]' 2000 short film ''Telling Lies'' juxtaposes a soundtrack of a man telling lies on the telephone against subtitles which expose the truth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/filmnetwork/A7079510|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831221429/http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/filmnetwork/A7079510|url-status=dead|title=BBC \u2013 Film Network<!-- Bot generated title -->|archive-date=August 31, 2006}}</ref>\n* [[Animutation]]s commonly use subtitles to present the comical [[mondegreen|\"fake lyrics\"]] (English words that sound close to what is actually being sung in the song in the non-English language). These fake lyrics are a major staple of the Animutation genre.\n* ''[[Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels]]'' contains a scene spoken entirely in [[cockney rhyming slang]] that is subtitled in standard English.\n* In an episode of ''[[Angry Beavers]]'', at one point Norbert begins to speak with such a heavy European accent that his words are subtitled on the bottom of the screen. Daggett actually touches the subtitles, shoving them out of the way.\n* In the American theatrical versions of [[Night Watch (2004 film)|''Night Watch'']] and ''[[Day Watch (film)|Day Watch]]'', Russian dialogues are translated by subtitles which are designed accordingly to the depicted events. For instance, subtitles dissolve in water like blood, tremble along with a shaking floor or get cut by sword.\n* The film ''[[Crank (film)|Crank]]'' contains a scene where [[Jason Statham]]'s character understands an Asian character's line of dialogue from reading the on-screen subtitle. The subtitle is even in reverse when his character reads the line. Later, an exclamation made by another Asian character is subtitled, but both the spoken words and the subtitles are in Chinese.\n* In ''[[Fatal Instinct]]'', also directed by [[Carl Reiner]], one scene involving two characters talking about their murder plan in Yiddish to prevent anyone from knowing about it, only to be foiled by a man on the bench reading the on-screen subtitles.\n* [[Ken Loach]] released the film ''[[Riff-Raff (1991 film)|Riff-Raff]]'' into American theatres with subtitles not only so people could understand the thick Scottish accents, but also to make fun of what he believes to be many Americans' need for them (mentioned in the theatrical trailer). Many of Loach's films contain traditional dialect, with some (e.g. ''[[The Price of Coal]]'') requiring subtitles even when shown on television in England.\n* In [[Bobby Lee]]'s \"Tae Do,\" a [[parody]] of Korean dramas in a ''[[Mad TV]]'' episode, the subtitles make more sense of the story than the Korean language being spoken.  The subtitles are made to appear as though written by someone with a poor understanding of grammar and are often intentionally made longer than what they actually say in the drama. For example, an actor says \"Sarang\" (\"I love you\"), but the subtitle is  so long that it covers the whole screen.\n* In television series [[Skithouse]], a journalist interviews a group of Afghan terrorists in English, but one of them gets subtitled and sees it. He gets mad because he takes as an insult that he is the only one to get subtitled.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFPm2fhB2pI|title=Skithouse: News report from Iraq|date=5 August 2007|work=YouTube}}</ref>\n* In [[Mel Brooks]] film ''[[Men in Tights]]'', the thoughts of Broomhilde's (Megan Cavanaugh) horse [[Farfelkugel]] are shown as subtitles when Broomhilde attempts to jump on saddle off balcony. As Farfelkugel shudders, the showtitles show \"She must be kidding!\"\n* In the television series ''[[Drawn Together]]'', the character Ling-Ling can only be understood through English subtitles, as his dialogue is delivered in a nonexistent language referred to as \"Japorean\" by [[Abbey DiGregorio]], the voice actress for the character.\n* In the television series ''[[Green Acres]]'' episode \u201cLisa's Mudder Comes for a Visit\u201d (season 5 episode 1), Lisa and her mother converse in Hungarian, with English Subtitles.  First, Lisa looks down and corrects the subtitles, \u201cNo no no, I said you hadn't changed a bit! We have a lot of trouble here with subtitles.\u201d, and they change.  Mother's Japanese chauffeur asks \u201cI begga pardon \u2013 I bringa bags inna house?\u201d that elicits a gong sound and Japanese subtitles. This is followed by Mother's great Dane barking with the subtitles \u201cI've seen better doghouses than this\u201d with Lisa responding \u201cWe're not interested in what the dog says\u201d, and the subtitles disappear. Later, the subtitles ask farmhand Eb if they will be needing any more subtitles for the episode.\n* In the UK television series ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', in episode 6 of Series 13, they purposely mistranslate the song sung by [[Carla Bruni]], having her supposedly denouncing hatred towards the trio of presenters (\"but mainly [[James May]]\") for destroying what is claimed to be her own [[Morris Marina]].\n* In Vance Joy's music video \"Riptide\" it shows a woman singing the lyrics to the song. At many points the lyrics which are sung \"I got a lump in my throat cause you're gonna sing the words wrong\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/riptide-lyrics-vance-joy.html|title=Vance Joy \u2013 Riptide Lyrics \u2013 MetroLyrics|work=metrolyrics.com}}</ref> are deliberately mis-subtitled as \"I got a lump in my throat cause you gone and sank the worlds wolf\"<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJ_1HMAGb4k|title=Vance Joy \u2013 'Riptide' Official Video|date=2 April 2013|work=YouTube}}</ref>\n* In [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]]'s music video for \"[[Smells Like Nirvana]]\", the second verse is subtitled as a way to mock the supposed unintelligibility of the song. One of the lines is \"It's hard to bargle nawdle zouss???\" (with three question marks), which has no meaning, but is explained by the following line, \"With all these marbles in my mouth\". While singing the latter, Yankovic indeed spits out a couple of marbles.\n\nOne unintentional source of humor in subtitles comes from illegal DVDs produced in non-English-speaking countries (especially China).  These DVDs often contain poorly worded subtitle tracks, possibly produced by [[machine translation]], with humorous results.  One of the better-known examples is a copy of ''[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith]]'' whose opening title was subtitled, \"Star war: The backstroke of the west\".<ref>{{cite web|title=episode iii, the backstroke of the west|url=http://winterson.com/2005/06/episode-iii-backstroke-of-west.html|work=winterson.com|publisher=Google, Inc|access-date=10 March 2013|author=jeremy|date=6 July 2005|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516224348/http://www.winterson.com/2005/06/episode-iii-backstroke-of-west.html|archive-date=16 May 2008|df=}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col |colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Airscript]]\n* [[Camtasia]]\n* [[Comparison of subtitle editors]]\n* [[Comparison of video player software#Subtitle ability|Comparison of software video players with subtitle support]]\n* [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|Dubbing]]\n* [[Interactive transcripts]]\n* [[Intertitle]]\n* [[Karaoke]]\n* [[Kameraflage]]\n* [[Subtitle editor]]\n* [[Surtitles]]\n* [[Same language subtitling]]\n* [[Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language]]\n* [[Telop]]\n* [[Time shifting]]\n* [[Transcription (linguistics)]]\n* [[WYSIWYG]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\nMany words such as \"Mum/Mom\", \"pyjamas/pajamas\", and so on, are commonly spelled according to the accent or national origin of the person speaking, rather than the language, country, or market the subtitles were created for.  For example, a British film released in the United States might use \"Mum\" when a British character is speaking, while using \"Mom\" when an American character is speaking.\n\n'''Phone captioning''' is a free service provided by the US government in which specially trained operators provide transcriptions for hearing-impaired telephone users.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n<!--===============({{NoMoreLinks}})===============-->\n<!-- DO NOT ADD MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

It was produced by [[Fred Foster]], released on July 1971 on [[Monument Records]] and followed his critically acclaimed debut ''[[Kristofferson (album)|Kristofferson]]''.\n\nThe album is mostly composed of Kristofferson's self-written material. It met critical success upon its release and unlike its predecessor, had commercial success. It became a top-thirty album on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' Top LPs & Tapes]] chart and reached the top five of the [[Top Country Albums|Hot Country LPs]] chart. Its single,  \"[[Lovin' Her Was Easier (Than Anything I'll Ever Do Again)]]\" charted on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] at number twenty-six and [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] charts at number four. ''The Silver Tongued Devil and I'' was later certified gold.\n\n==Background and recording==\nIn 1969, [[Kris Kristofferson]] signed a recording contract with producer [[Fred Foster]], and joined [[Monument Records]] and its publishing house [[Combine Music]]. His debut album ''[[Kristofferson (album)|Kristofferson]]'' was a critical success but it sold poorly.{{sfn|Larkin, Colin|2011|p=1984}} That year, Kristofferson started an eighteen-month tour, during which he suffered a bout of [[Atypical pneumonia|walking pneumonia]], which was worsened by his alcohol consumption. While performing, he would not face the audience and mumbled the words to his songs. Eventually, he was hospitalized.{{sfn|Hurd, Mary|p=42|2015}} \n\nDuring the tour, Kristoffersion performed on ''[[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|The Johnny Cash Show]]''. While in California, Kristofferson met and became friends with singer [[Janis Joplin]].{{sfn|Streissguth, Michael|2013|p=87}}  Upon returning to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], he had already learned of her death but with his mail at Combine Music, he received Joplin's album ''[[Pearl (Janis Joplin album)|Pearl]]'', which at the time was still unreleased. Joplin's album included a cover of his original composition \"[[Me and Bobby McGee]]\". the following morning, he returned to the studio and recorded the songs for his second release, titled ''The Silver Tongued Devil and I''.{{sfn|Streissguth, Michael|2013|p=88,89}}\n\n==Content==\n{{Listen |filename=The Silver Tongued Devil and I.ogg|title=\"The Silver Tongued and I\" |description=Excerpt of the title-track, and opening of the album}}\n\n\"The Silver Tongued Devil and I\" opens the album. The song is set in Tally-Ho Tavern, a [[Music Row]] bar where Kristofferon earlier worked as a bartender,{{sfn|Hurd, Mary|p=43|2015}} and the patrons included musicians and songwriters.{{sfn|Tobler, John|1991|p=1998}} Kristofferson describes a man drinking in a bar; he is too shy to talk to a woman. As the character get drunk, he tries to warn the woman of \"The Silver Tongued Devil\" that alcohol brings out in him and how it controls him, inevitably seducing women.{{sfn|Hurd, Mary|p=43|2015}} Kristofferson was known among his peers to easily cause the infatuation of women, a recurring theme in the songs of the album.{{sfn|Shaver, Billy Joe; Reagan, Brad|p=30|2005}}{{sfn|Hurd, Mary|p=43|2015}} According to Kristofferson's biographers, due to the autobiographical nature of the record, he may have experienced guilt because his sporadic partners aimed to romantic-related results, while he did not.{{sfn|Hurd, Mary|p=43|2015}}{{sfn|Miller, Stephen|2009|p=116}} \n\n\"Jody and the Kid\" had been recorded in 1968 by [[Roy Drusky]] and became a radio hit when Kristofferson worked as a janitor for [[Columbia Records]].{{sfn|Larkin, Colin|p=28|2006}} The inspiration for the song was an experience Kristofferson had at  Tally-Ho Tavern. As he approached the building with his daughter Tracy, a patron shouted: \"Look, here comes Critter, and the kid\", in reference to one of Kristofferson's nicknames, Critter.{{sfn|Miller, Stephen|2009|p=115}} The song tells the story of a young girl who follows the main character, and the positive reaction of the locals who see them together. As they grew older, they become lovers. At the end of the story, the main character walks with his daughter. While the locals acknowledge them as they pass by, he laments that his partner is absent. {{sfn|Hurd, Mary|p=45|2015}} \"Billy Dee\" described the life struggles of a [[heroin]] addict whose life ends with an overdose.{{sfn|Tiegel, Elliot|1971|p=12}}\n\n\"Good Christian Soldier\" was written by [[Billy Joe Shaver]], who was working for singer [[Bobby Bare]] as a songwriter.{{sfn|Shaver, Billy Joe; Reagan, Brad|p=29|2005}} Bare introduced Shaver to [[Chet Atkins]], who asked him to write a \"[[tongue-in-cheek]]\" song about the [[Vietnam War]]. Shaver, who did not understand the expression, decided instead to write a song about how he felt the experience of war would affect him. Atkins was unhappy with the result, and following his reaction Shaver decided to leave Nashville. Bare pleaded with Shaver, who was already set to leave. At 03:00, Kristofferson called Bare. After a night out, Kristofferson wanted to tell Bare about the new album he was working on. Bare agreed and asked Shaver to stay and wait for Kristofferson.{{sfn|Shaver, Billy Joe; Reagan, Brad|p=30|2005}} When Kristofferson arrived, Bare asked Shaver to play one of his songs. Shaver sang \"Christian Soldier\", which he had just completed. Kristofferson was impressed and assured Shaver he would to include it on his release. Shaver, who thought Kristofferson mocked him, drove to Texas. Weeks later, Bare called Shaver to notify him Kristofferson had included the song on his album. To Shaver's displease, Bare also informed him he changed the name of the song to \"Good Christian Soldier\" and that he now had a co-writing credit.{{sfn|Shaver, Billy Joe; Reagan, Brad|p=31|2005}} The song is about the war experience of a preacher's son from [[Oklahoma]].{{sfn|Hurd, Mary|p=46|2015}} \n\n\"Breakdown (A Long Way From Home)\" is featured on Kristofferson's acting debut, the 1970 film ''[[Cisco Pike]]'', which was still unreleased at the time of the album's recording.{{sfn|Andersen, Thom|2008|p=163}}  The song is about a man who reminisces about his past.{{sfn|Hurd, Mary|p=44|2015}} The following track \"Lovin' Her Was Easier (Than Anything I'll Ever Do Again)\", which was written by Kristofferson in 1969 as he accompanied [[Dennis Hopper]] during the production of ''[[The Last Movie]]'', was also included in ''Cisco Pike''. Kristofferson was inspired by the scenery of the [[Andes]] mountain range.{{sfn|Hurd, Mary|p=45-46|2015}} The song was first recorded and released by [[Roger Miller]] in early July 1971 on [[Mercury Records]]; Miller's version entered the Top 40 of [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]] Hot Country Singles.{{sfn|Smith, Chas|2007|p=376}} \n\nThe \"The Taker\", also written by Kristofferson, was first recorded by [[Waylon Jennings]] and released as the title track of [[The Taker/Tulsa|his 1971 album]]. The song is about a man who attracts a woman who becomes [[Infatuation|infatuated]] with him. The man takes advantage of the woman, takes her for granted and leaves her.{{sfn|Hurd, Mary|p=43|2015}} \"When I Loved Her\", the next track, was first recorded and released by [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]] in July 1971 as the [[B-side]] to another Kristofferson song, \"I'd Rather Be Sorry\".{{sfn|Billboard staff|1971|p=51}}\n\n{{Listen |filename=The Pilgrim - Chapter 33.ogg|title=\"The Pilgrim - Chapter 33\" |description=Dedicated to Kristofferson's peers, the song was also featured in the film, ''[[Cisco Pike]]''}}\n\n\"The Pilgrim, Chapter 33\" described a man who has fallen upon hard times. The character had a past full of \"money, love and dreams\" that he traded for his current life as he went after his purpose despite of the consequences.{{sfn|Hurd, Mary|p=44|2015}} The song was inspired by Kristofferson's own experience of living as a songwriter, as well as that of one of his often-unemployed peers.{{sfn|Hurd, Mary|p=116|2015}}  He opened the song by listing the artists who inspired it; [[Chris Gantry]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Bobby Neuwirth]], Norman Norbert, [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]], Dennis Hopper, [[Jerry Jeff Walker]] and [[Paul Siebel]]. The song is also featured in ''Cisco Pike''.{{sfn|Lambert, Arden|2018}}\n\n\"Epitaph (Black and Blue)\" closes the album. Kristofferson had repeatedly to Janis Joplin's album ''Pearl'' and was affected by her death; he wrote the song in one night.{{sfn|Streissguth, Michael|2013|p=88}} Session musician [[Donnie Fritts]] assisted him with the composition on the keyboard. Fritts wrote the tune initially using simple [[Chord (music)|chord]]s that he eventually modified using [[Rhythm and blues|rhythm-and-blues]]-style [[passing chord]]s. As Fritts performed the recent changes for Kristofferson, Foster\u2014who was in the control room\u2014said he wanted the song to be only performed by Fritts and Kristofferson for the album. Foster later added scarce string backing to the last verse.{{sfn|Streissguth, Michael|2013|p=89}} While recounting his experience to [[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]], Kristofferson said: \"It\u2019s the kind of song you write because you have to, not because you want to\".{{sfn|Thomson, Greame|2016}}\n\n==Style==\nThe production of ''The Silver Tongued Devil and I'' introduced violins and a horn section to Kristofferson's music. The theme remained centered in his songwriting.{{sfn|Hurd, Mary|p=42|2015}} At the time of its release, fans of the album argued it is a [[concept album]]. Kristofferson later expressed uncertainty of his intentions while working on it; he stated, \"I was just trying to put together my best songs in a way that all made sense\".{{sfn|Streissguth, Michael|2013|p=89}}\n\nThe cover of the album shows Kristofferson standing front-and-center while to his left, his own faded figure\u2014which was intended to represent \"The Silver Tongued Devil\"\u2014is visible.{{sfn|Hurd, Mary|p=42|2015}} The picture was taken by [[Baron Wolman]]. In the liner notes, Kristofferson wrote; \"call these echoes of the going-ups and the coming-downs, walking pneumonia and run-of-the-mill madness, colored with guilt, pride and a vague sense of despair\".{{sfn|Kristofferson, Kris|1971}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n''The Silver Tongued Devil and I'' was released in July 1971 to critical and commercial success.{{sfn|Cusic, Don|2008|p=120}} It peaked at number twenty-one on [[Billboard 200|''Billboard's'' Top LPs & Tapes]] chart{{sfn|White, Adam|1990|p=128}} and at number four on the [[Top Country Albums|Hot Country LPs]] chart.{{sfn|Billboard staff 3|1971}} By 1973, the album was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].{{sfn|Ewen, David|1977|p=663}} The track \"Loving Her Was Easier (Than Anything I'll Ever Do Again)\" was released as a single on August 21, 1971, and was backed with \"Epitaph (Black and Blue)\"; it entered the top thirty of Billboard's [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart and peaked at number twenty-eight.{{sfn|Whitburn, Joel|2003|p=393}} \n\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = ''[[Country Music (magazine)|Country Music]]''  \n| rev1Score = Favorable\n| rev2      = ''[[The Village Voice]]'' ([[Robert Christgau]])\n| rev2Score = C-\n| rev3      = ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''\n| rev3Score = Favorable\n| rev4     =  ''[[Sound & Vision (magazine)|Stereo Review]]'' \n| rev4Score = Favorable\n| rev5     =  ''[[Audio (magazine)|Audio]]'' \n| rev5Score = Favorable\n| rev6 = ''[[Allmusic]]'' \n| rev6Score = {{Rating|5|5}} \n}}\n\nCritic [[Dave Hickey]] of [[Country Music (magazine)|Country Music]]  was impressed by Kristofferson's sense of [[Metre (poetry)|metrics]]. Of the lines composed by twelve and sixteen syllables he wrote; \"they are so tight and clear that it is like having another rhythm instrument in the band\". Hickey also wrote; \"There has never been, and probably never will be a better songwriter album\".{{sfn|Miller, Stephen|2009|p=117}} [[Robert Christgau]] of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' rated the album C- and criticized what he considered Kristofferon's \"pet paradox\" as a songwriter and a \"hobo intellectual as Music Row hit man\". He called Kristoffersn's contributions to the album \"ungainly, not to say dishonest\".{{sfn|Christgau, Robert|1981}} \n\n''Billboard'' said the album shows Kristofferson's \"consummate skill at natural, sincere simple country songs\" and that his \"untrained bass voice\" interprets the songs \"even better\" than artists who had previously covered his work.{{sfn|Billboard staff 2|1971|p=53}} ''[[Sound & Vision (magazine)|Stereo Review]]'' delivered a favorable review, sating the album is \"better\" than Kristofferson's debut album. The review predicted ''The Silver Tongued Devil and I'' would have \"much less impact\" than his first album but that it presents a \"much more assured singer\" than his debut record.{{sfn|Coppage, Noel|1972|p=83, 84}} ''[[Audio (magazine)|Audio]]'' called Kristofferson a writer \"filled with pathos and compassion\" who \"put both into his lyrics\" and said the release benefits from his \"husky, sorrowful voice\".{{sfn|Audio staff|p=94|1972}}\n\nIn a later review, William Ruhlmann of ''[[Allmusic]]'' gave ''The Silver Tongued Devil and I'' five stars out of five. Ruhlmann said the album contains \"several excellent songs\" but said it \"could not live up to its predecessor&nbsp;... the antiestablishment tone of some of Kristofferson was gone along with much of the wry humor, and in their place were touches of morbidity and sentimentality\".{{sfn|Ruhlmann, William|2016}}\n\n==In popular culture==\n''The Silver Tongued Devil and I'' is featured in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s 1976 film ''[[Taxi Driver]]''. In a scene, the main character [[Travis Bickle|Travis Bickle's]] ([[Robert De Niro]]) love interest compares him to the character of \"The Pilgrim, Chapter 33\" and Bickle later buys the record. Before Scorsese filmed ''Taxi Driver'', Kristofferson played a supporting role in Scorsese's film ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]''.{{sfn|Fear, David|2019}}\n\n== Track Listing ==\n{{Track

album recorded by singer-songwriter [[Kris Kristofferson]]. It was produced by [[Fred Foster]], released on July 1971 on [[Monument Records]] and followed his critically acclaimed debut ''[[Kristofferson (album)|Kristofferson]]''.\n\nThe album is mostly composed of Kristofferson's self-written material. It met critical success upon its release and unlike its predecessor, had commercial success. It became a top-thirty album on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' Top LPs & Tapes]] chart and reached the top five of the [[Top Country Albums|Hot Country LPs]] chart. Its single,  \"[[Lovin' Her Was Easier (Than Anything I'll Ever Do Again)]]\" charted on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] at number twenty-six and [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] charts at number four. ''The Silver Tongued Devil and I'' was later certified gold.\n\n==Background and recording==\nIn 1969, [[Kris Kristofferson]] signed a recording contract with producer [[Fred Foster]], and joined [[Monument Records]] and its publishing house [[Combine Music]]. His debut album ''[[Kristofferson (album)|Kristofferson]]'' was a critical success but it sold poorly.{{sfn|Larkin, Colin|2011|p=1984}} That year, Kristofferson started an eighteen-month tour, during which he suffered a bout of [[Atypical pneumonia|walking pneumonia]], which was worsened by his alcohol consumption. While performing, he would not face the audience and mumbled the words to his songs. Eventually, he was hospitalized.{{sfn|Hurd, Mary|p=42|2015}} \n\nDuring the tour, Kristoffersion performed on ''[[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|The Johnny Cash Show]]''. While in California, Kristofferson met and became friends with singer [[Janis Joplin]].{{sfn|Streissguth, Michael|2013|p=87}}  Upon returning to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], he had already learned of her death but with his mail at Combine Music, he received Joplin's album ''[[Pearl (Janis Joplin album)|Pearl]]'', which at the time was still unreleased. Joplin's album included a cover of his original composition \"[[Me and Bobby McGee]]\". the following morning, he returned to the studio and recorded the songs for his second release, titled ''The Silver Tongued Devil and I''.{{sfn|Streissguth, Michael|2013|p=88,89}}\n\n==Content==\n{{Listen |filename=The Silver Tongued Devil and I.ogg|title=\"The Silver Tongued and I\" |description=Excerpt of the title-track, and opening of the album}}\n\n\"The Silver Tongued Devil and I\" opens the album. The song is set in Tally-Ho Tavern, a [[Music Row]] bar where Kristofferon earlier worked as a bartender,{{sfn|Hurd, Mary|p=43|2015}} and the patrons included musicians and songwriters.{{sfn|Tobler, John|1991|p=1998}} Kristofferson describes a man drinking in a bar; he is too shy to talk to a woman. As the character get drunk, he tries to warn the woman of \"The Silver Tongued Devil\" that alcohol brings out in him and how it controls him, inevitably seducing women.{{sfn|Hurd, Mary|p=43|2015}} Kristofferson was known among his peers to easily cause the infatuation of women, a recurring theme in the songs of the album.{{sfn|Shaver, Billy Joe; Reagan, Brad|p=30|2005}}{{sfn|Hurd, Mary|p=43|2015}} According to Kristofferson's biographers, due to the autobiographical nature of the record, he may have experienced guilt because his sporadic partners aimed to romantic-related results, while he did not.{{sfn|Hurd, Mary|p=43|2015}}{{sfn|Miller, Stephen|2009|p=116}} \n\n\"Jody and the Kid\" had been recorded in 1968 by [[Roy Drusky]] and became a radio hit when Kristofferson worked as a janitor for [[Columbia Records]].{{sfn|Larkin, Colin|p=28|2006}} The inspiration for the song was an experience Kristofferson had at  Tally-Ho Tavern. As he approached the building with his daughter Tracy, a patron shouted: \"Look, here comes Critter, and the kid\", in reference to one of Kristofferson's nicknames, Critter.{{sfn|Miller, Stephen|2009|p=115}} The song tells the story of a young girl who follows the main character, and the positive reaction of the locals who see them together. As they grew older, they become lovers. At the end of the story, the main character walks with his daughter. While the locals acknowledge them as they pass by, he laments that his partner is absent. {{sfn|Hurd, Mary|p=45|2015}} \"Billy Dee\" described the life struggles of a [[heroin]] addict whose life ends with an overdose.{{sfn|Tiegel, Elliot|1971|p=12}}\n\n\"Good Christian Soldier\" was written by [[Billy Joe Shaver]], who was working for singer [[Bobby Bare]] as a songwriter.{{sfn|Shaver, Billy Joe; Reagan, Brad|p=29|2005}} Bare introduced Shaver to [[Chet Atkins]], who asked him to write a \"[[tongue-in-cheek]]\" song about the [[Vietnam War]]. Shaver, who did not understand the expression, decided instead to write a song about how he felt the experience of war would affect him. Atkins was unhappy with the result, and following his reaction Shaver decided to leave Nashville. Bare pleaded with Shaver, who was already set to leave. At 03:00, Kristofferson called Bare. After a night out, Kristofferson wanted to tell Bare about the new album he was working on. Bare agreed and asked Shaver to stay and wait for Kristofferson.{{sfn|Shaver, Billy Joe; Reagan, Brad|p=30|2005}} When Kristofferson arrived, Bare asked Shaver to play one of his songs. Shaver sang \"Christian Soldier\", which he had just completed. Kristofferson was impressed and assured Shaver he would to include it on his release. Shaver, who thought Kristofferson mocked him, drove to Texas. Weeks later, Bare called Shaver to notify him Kristofferson had included the song on his album. To Shaver's displease, Bare also informed him he changed the name of the song to \"Good Christian Soldier\" and that he now had a co-writing credit.{{sfn|Shaver, Billy Joe; Reagan, Brad|p=31|2005}} The song is about the war experience of a preacher's son from [[Oklahoma]].{{sfn|Hurd, Mary|p=46|2015}} \n\n\"Breakdown (A Long Way From Home)\" is featured on Kristofferson's acting debut, the 1970 film ''[[Cisco Pike]]'', which was still unreleased at the time of the album's recording.{{sfn|Andersen, Thom|2008|p=163}}  The song is about a man who reminisces about his past.{{sfn|Hurd, Mary|p=44|2015}} The following track \"Lovin' Her Was Easier (Than Anything I'll Ever Do Again)\", which was written by Kristofferson in 1969 as he accompanied [[Dennis Hopper]] during the production of ''[[The Last Movie]]'', was also included in ''Cisco Pike''. Kristofferson was inspired by the scenery of the [[Andes]] mountain range.{{sfn|Hurd, Mary|p=45-46|2015}} The song was first recorded and released by [[Roger Miller]] in early July 1971 on [[Mercury Records]]; Miller's version entered the Top 40 of [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]] Hot Country Singles.{{sfn|Smith, Chas|2007|p=376}} \n\nThe \"The Taker\", also written by Kristofferson, was first recorded by [[Waylon Jennings]] and released as the title track of [[The Taker/Tulsa|his 1971 album]]. The song is about a man who attracts a woman who becomes [[Infatuation|infatuated]] with him. The man takes advantage of the woman, takes her for granted and leaves her.{{sfn|Hurd, Mary|p=43|2015}} \"When I Loved Her\", the next track, was first recorded and released by [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]] in July 1971 as the [[B-side]] to another Kristofferson song, \"I'd Rather Be Sorry\".{{sfn|Billboard staff|1971|p=51}}\n\n{{Listen |filename=The Pilgrim - Chapter 33.ogg|title=\"The Pilgrim - Chapter 33\" |description=Dedicated to Kristofferson's peers, the song was also featured in the film, ''[[Cisco Pike]]''}}\n\n\"The Pilgrim, Chapter 33\" described a man who has fallen upon hard times. The character had a past full of \"money, love and dreams\" that he traded for his current life as he went after his purpose despite of the consequences.{{sfn|Hurd, Mary|p=44|2015}} The song was inspired by Kristofferson's own experience of living as a songwriter, as well as that of one of his often-unemployed peers.{{sfn|Hurd, Mary|p=116|2015}}  He opened the song by listing the artists who inspired it; [[Chris Gantry]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Bobby Neuwirth]], Norman Norbert, [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]], Dennis Hopper, [[Jerry Jeff Walker]] and [[Paul Siebel]]. The song is also featured in ''Cisco Pike''.{{sfn|Lambert, Arden|2018}}\n\n\"Epitaph (Black and Blue)\" closes the album. Kristofferson had repeatedly to Janis Joplin's album ''Pearl'' and was affected by her death; he wrote the song in one night.{{sfn|Streissguth, Michael|2013|p=88}} Session musician [[Donnie Fritts]] assisted him with the composition on the keyboard. Fritts wrote the tune initially using simple [[chord]]s that he eventually modified using [[Rhythm and blues|rhythm-and-blues]]-style [[passing chord]]s. As Fritts performed the recent changes for Kristofferson, Foster\u2014who was in the control room\u2014said he wanted the song to be only performed by Fritts and Kristofferson for the album. Foster later added scarce string backing to the last verse.{{sfn|Streissguth, Michael|2013|p=89}} While recounting his experience to [[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]], Kristofferson said: \"It\u2019s the kind of song you write because you have to, not because you want to\".{{sfn|Thomson, Greame|2016}}\n\n==Style==\nThe production of ''The Silver Tongued Devil and I'' introduced violins and a horn section to Kristofferson's music. The theme remained centered in his songwriting.{{sfn|Hurd, Mary|p=42|2015}} At the time of its release, fans of the album argued it is a [[concept album]]. Kristofferson later expressed uncertainty of his intentions while working on it; he stated, \"I was just trying to put together my best songs in a way that all made sense\".{{sfn|Streissguth, Michael|2013|p=89}}\n\nThe cover of the album shows Kristofferson standing front-and-center while to his left, his own faded figure\u2014which was intended to represent \"The Silver Tongued Devil\"\u2014is visible.{{sfn|Hurd, Mary|p=42|2015}} The picture was taken by [[Baron Wolman]]. In the liner notes, Kristofferson wrote; \"call these echoes of the going-ups and the coming-downs, walking pneumonia and run-of-the-mill madness, colored with guilt, pride and a vague sense of despair\".{{sfn|Kristofferson, Kris|1971}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n''The Silver Tongued Devil and I'' was released in July 1971 to critical and commercial success.{{sfn|Cusic, Don|2008|p=120}} It peaked at number twenty-one on [[Billboard 200|''Billboard's'' Top LPs & Tapes]] chart{{sfn|White, Adam|1990|p=128}} and at number four on the [[Top Country Albums|Hot Country LPs]] chart.{{sfn|Billboard staff 3|1971}} By 1973, the album was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].{{sfn|Ewen, David|1977|p=663}} The track \"Loving Her Was Easier (Than Anything I'll Ever Do Again)\" was released as a single on August 21, 1971, and was backed with \"Epitaph (Black and Blue)\"; it entered the top thirty of Billboard's [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart and peaked at number twenty-eight.{{sfn|Whitburn, Joel|2003|p=393}} \n\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = ''[[Country Music (magazine)|Country Music]]''  \n| rev1Score = Favorable\n| rev2      = ''[[The Village Voice]]'' ([[Robert Christgau]])\n| rev2Score = C-\n| rev3      = ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''\n| rev3Score = Favorable\n| rev4     =  ''[[Sound & Vision (magazine)|Stereo Review]]'' \n| rev4Score = Favorable\n| rev5     =  ''[[Audio (magazine)|Audio]]'' \n| rev5Score = Favorable\n| rev6 = ''[[Allmusic]]'' \n| rev6Score = {{Rating|5|5}} \n}}\n\nCritic [[Dave Hickey]] of [[Country Music (magazine)|Country Music]]  was impressed by Kristofferson's sense of [[Metre (poetry)|metrics]]. Of the lines composed by twelve and sixteen syllables he wrote; \"they are so tight and clear that it is like having another rhythm instrument in the band\". Hickey also wrote; \"There has never been, and probably never will be a better songwriter album\".{{sfn|Miller, Stephen|2009|p=117}} [[Robert Christgau]] of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' rated the album C- and criticized what he considered Kristofferon's \"pet paradox\" as a songwriter and a \"hobo intellectual as Music Row hit man\". He called Kristoffersn's contributions to the album \"ungainly, not to say dishonest\".{{sfn|Christgau, Robert|1981}} \n\n''Billboard'' said the album shows Kristofferson's \"consummate skill at natural, sincere simple country songs\" and that his \"untrained bass voice\" interprets the songs \"even better\" than artists who had previously covered his work.{{sfn|Billboard staff 2|1971|p=53}} ''[[Sound & Vision (magazine)|Stereo Review]]'' delivered a favorable review, sating the album is \"better\" than Kristofferson's debut album. The review predicted ''The Silver Tongued Devil and I'' would have \"much less impact\" than his first album but that it presents a \"much more assured singer\" than his debut record.{{sfn|Coppage, Noel|1972|p=83, 84}} ''[[Audio (magazine)|Audio]]'' called Kristofferson a writer \"filled with pathos and compassion\" who \"put both into his lyrics\" and said the release benefits from his \"husky, sorrowful voice\".{{sfn|Audio staff|p=94|1972}}\n\nIn a later review, William Ruhlmann of ''[[Allmusic]]'' gave ''The Silver Tongued Devil and I'' five stars out of five. Ruhlmann said the album contains \"several excellent songs\" but said it \"could not live up to its predecessor&nbsp;... the antiestablishment tone of some of Kristofferson was gone along with much of the wry humor, and in their place were touches of morbidity and sentimentality\".{{sfn|Ruhlmann, William|2016}}\n\n==In popular culture==\n''The Silver Tongued Devil and I'' is featured in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s 1976 film ''[[Taxi Driver]]''. In a scene, the main character [[Travis Bickle|Travis Bickle's]] ([[Robert De Niro]]) love interest compares him to the character of \"The Pilgrim, Chapter 33\" and Bickle later buys the record. Before Scorsese filmed ''Taxi Driver'', Kristofferson played a supporting role in Scorsese's film ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]''.{{sfn|Fear, David|2019}}\n\n== Track Listing ==\n{{Track

They are also used in [[Horse#Sport|competitive sports]] including [[dressage]], [[endurance riding]], [[eventing]], [[reining]], [[show jumping]], [[tent pegging]], [[equestrian vaulting|vaulting]], [[polo]], [[horse racing]], [[driving (horse)|driving]], and [[rodeo]] (see additional equestrian sports listed later in this article for more examples).  Some popular forms of competition are grouped together at [[horse show]]s where horses perform in a wide variety of disciplines. Horses (and other [[equid]]s such as [[mule]]s) are used for non-competitive recreational riding such as [[fox hunting]], [[trail riding]], or hacking. There is public access to horse trails in almost every part of the world; many parks, [[ranch]]es, and public [[stable]]s offer both guided and independent riding. Horses are also used for [[therapeutic horseback riding|therapeutic]] purposes both in specialized para-equestrian competition as well as non-competitive riding to improve human health and emotional development.\n\n[[Horses]] are also [[driving (horse)|driven]] in [[harness racing]], at [[horse show|horse shows,]] and in other types of exhibition such as [[historical reenactment]] or ceremony, often pulling [[carriage]]s. In some parts of the world, they are still used for practical purposes such as [[farm]]ing.\n\nHorses continue to be used in public service, in traditional ceremonies (parades, funerals), [[police horse|police]] and volunteer mounted patrols and for [[mounted search and rescue]].\n\n[[Riding hall]]s enable the training of horse and rider in all weathers as well as indoor competition riding.\n\n==History of horse use==\n[[File:Cave painting in Doushe cave, Lorstan, Iran, 8th millennium BC.JPG|thumb|Prehistoric cave painting, depicting a horse and rider]]\n{{Main|Domestication of the horse|Horses in warfare}}\nThough there is controversy over the exact date horses were [[domestication|domesticated]] and when they were first ridden, the best estimate is that horses first were ridden approximately 3500 BC. Indirect evidence suggests that horses were ridden long before they were driven. There is some evidence that about 3,000 BC, near the [[Dnieper River]] and the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]], people were using [[Bit (horse)|bits]] on horses, as a stallion that was buried there shows teeth wear consistent with using a bit.<ref name=Chamberlin69>Chamberlin, J. Edward ''Horse: How the Horse has Shaped Civilization'' New York:BlueBridge 2006 {{ISBN|0-9742405-9-1}}</ref> However, the most unequivocal early [[archeology|archaeological]] evidence of equines put to working use was of horses being driven. [[Chariot]] burials about 2500 BC present the most direct hard evidence of horses used as [[working animal]]s. In ancient times chariot warfare was followed by the use of [[horses in warfare|war horses]] as light and heavy [[cavalry]]. The horse played an important role throughout human history all over the world, both in warfare and in peaceful pursuits such as [[transportation]], [[trade]] and [[agriculture]]. Horses lived in North America, but died out at the end of the [[Ice Age]]. Horses were brought back to North America by European explorers, beginning with the second voyage of [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] in 1493.<ref>Bennett, Deb (1998) 'Conquerors: The Roots of New World Horsemanship.'' Amigo Publications Inc; 1st edition. {{ISBN|0-9658533-0-6}}, p. 151</ref> Equestrianism was introduced in the [[1900 Summer Olympics]] as an Olympic sport with jumping events.\n\n==Horse racing==\n{{Main|Horse racing|Harness racing|Parimutuel gambling}}\nHumans appear to have long expressed a desire to know which horse or horses were the fastest, and [[horse racing]] has ancient roots. [[Gambling]] on horse races appears to go hand-in hand with racing and has a long history as well. [[Thoroughbred]]s have the pre-eminent reputation as a racing breed, but other breeds also race.\n\n===Types of horse racing===\nUnder saddle:\n* [[Thoroughbred horse racing]] is the most popular form worldwide. In the UK, it is known as [[flat racing]] and is governed by the [[Jockey Club]] in the United Kingdom. In the US, horse racing is governed by [[The Jockey Club]]. other light breeds are also raced worldwide.\n* [[Steeplechase (horse racing)|Steeplechasing]] involves racing on a track where the horses also jump over obstacles. It is most common in the UK, where it is also called [[National Hunt]] racing.\n\nIn harness:\n* Both light and heavy breeds as well as ponies are raced in harness with a [[sulky]] or racing bike. The [[Standardbred]] dominates the sport in both [[trot (horse gait)|trotting]] and [[Pacing (horse gait)|pacing]] varieties.\n* The United States Trotting Association organizes [[harness racing]] in the United States.\n* Harness racing is also found throughout Europe, New Zealand and Australia.\n\nDistance racing:\n\n* [[Endurance riding]], takes place over a given, measured distance and the horses have an even start.  Top level races are usually {{convert|50|to|100|mi|km}}, over mountainous or other natural terrain, with scheduled stops to take the horses' vital signs, check soundness and verify that the horse is fit to continue. The first horse to finish and be confirmed by the veterinarian as fit to continue is the winner. Limited distance rides of about {{convert|25|-|20|mi}} are offered to newcomers. Variants include [[Ride and Tie]] and various forms of [[long riding]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Nagy|first=Annamaria|last2=Dyson|first2=Sue|last3=Murray|first3=Jane|date=18 June 2012|year=|title=A veterinary review of endurance riding as an international competitive sport.|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sue_Dyson3/publication/229435826_A_veterinary_review_of_endurance_riding_as_an_international_competitive_sport/links/5be003c892851c6b27a79f06/A-veterinary-review-of-endurance-riding-as-an-international-competitive-sport.pdf|journal=The Veterinary Journal|language=English|volume=|issue=194|pages=288-293|doi=|issn=|via=Elsevier}}</ref>\n\n==International and Olympic disciplines==\n{{Main|Equestrian at the Olympics|International Federation for Equestrian Sports}}\nEquestrian events were first included in the modern [[Olympic Games]] in 1900. By 1912, all three Olympic disciplines still seen today were part of the games. The following forms of competition are recognized worldwide and are a part of the [[Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|equestrian events]] at the Olympics. They are governed by the rules of the [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports]] (FEI).\n* [[Dressage]] (\"training\" in [[French language|French]]) involves the progressive training of the horse to a high level of [[impulsion]], [[collection (horse)|collection]] and obedience.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dressage-academy.com/training/dressage/|title=What is Dressage? \u2013 Dressage Academy Training|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref> Competitive dressage has the goal of showing the horse carrying out, on request, the natural movements that it performs without thinking while running loose.\n* [[Show jumping]] comprises a timed event judged on the ability of the horse and rider to jump over a series of obstacles, in a given order and with the fewest refusals or knockdowns of portions of the obstacles.\n* [[Eventing]], also called ''combined training'', ''horse trials'', the ''three-day event'', ''the Military'' or ''the complete test'', puts together the obedience of dressage with the athletic ability of show jumping, the fitness demands the [[cross-country equestrianism|cross-country jumping]] phase. In the last-named, the horses jump over fixed obstacles, such as logs, stone walls, [[bank (obstacle)|banks]], [[ditch (obstacle)|ditches]] and [[water (obstacle)|water]], trying to finish the course under the \"optimum time.\" There was also the 'Steeple Chase' Phase, which is now excluded from most major competitions to bring them in line with the Olympic standard.\n\nThe additional internationally sanctioned but non-Olympic disciplines governed by the [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|FEI]] are: [[combined driving]]; [[endurance riding|endurance]]; [[reining]]; and [[equestrian vaulting|vaulting]]. These disciplines are part of the [[FEI World Equestrian Games]] every four years and may hold their own individual World Championships in other years. The FEI also recognizes [[horseball]] and [[tent pegging]] as its two regional disciplines.\n\n===Para-equestrian disciplines===\n[[Para-equestrian]] competition at the international level, including the [[Equestrian at the Summer Paralympics|Paralympics]], are also governed by the FEI and offer the following competition events:\n* Para-Equestrian Dressage is conducted under the same rules as conventional Dressage, but with riders divided into different competition grades based on their functional abilities.<ref>[http://www.fei.org/disciplines/dressage/about-para-equestrian-dressage ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508135709/http://www.fei.org/disciplines/dressage/about-para-equestrian-dressage |date=May 8, 2013 }}</ref>\n* Para-Equestrian Driving places competitors in grades based on their skill.<ref>[http://www.fei.org/disciplines/driving/about-para-equestrian-driving ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501195554/http://www.fei.org/disciplines/driving/about-para-equestrian-driving |date=May 1, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Haute \u00c9cole==\n{{Main|Classical dressage}}\nThe ''haute \u00e9cole'' ([[French language|F.]] \"high school\"), an advanced component of [[Classical dressage]], is a highly refined set of skills seldom used in competition but often seen in demonstration performances.\n\nThe world's leading Classical dressage programs include:\n* The [[Cadre Noir]] in [[Saumur]], [[France]].\n* The [[Spanish Riding School]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].\n* The [[Portuguese School of Equestrian Art]] at [[Queluz National Palace]], [[Portugal]].\n* The [[Royal Andalusian School of Equestrian Art]] in [[Jerez de la Frontera]], [[Spain]].\n\nOther major classical teams include the [[South African Lipizzaners]] and the [[Hollandsche Manege]] of the [[Netherlands]].\n\n==Horse shows==\n{{Main|Horse show}}\n\n[[Horse show]]s are held throughout the world with a tremendous variety of possible events, equipment, attire and judging standards used. However, most forms of horse show competition can be broken into the following broad categories:\n* [[Equitation]], sometimes called ''seat and hands'' or ''horsemanship'', refers to events where the rider is judged on form, style and ability.\n* ''Pleasure, flat'' or ''under saddle'' classes feature horses who are ridden on the flat (not jumped) and judged on manners, performance, movement, style and quality.\n* ''Halter, in-hand breeding'' or ''conformation'' classes, where the horse is led by a handler on the ground and judged on conformation and suitability as a breeding animal.\n* ''Harness'' classes, where the horse is [[Driving (horse)|driven]] rather than ridden, but still judged on manners, performance and quality.\n* ''Jumping'' or ''Over Fences'' refers broadly to both [[show jumping]] and [[show hunter]], where horses and riders must jump obstacles.\n\n==\"English\" riding==\n{{Main|English riding}}\nIn addition to the classical Olympic events, the following forms of competition are seen. In North America they are referred to as \"[[English riding]]\" in contrast with western riding; elsewhere in the world, if a distinction is necessary, they are usually described as \"classic riding\":\n* [[Hunt seat]] or [[Show hunter|Hunter]] classes judge the movement and the form of horses suitable for work over fences. A typical [[show hunter]] division would include classes over fences as well as \"Hunter under Saddle\" or \"flat\" classes (sometimes called \"hack\" classes), in which the horse is judged on its performance, manners and movement without having to jump. Hunters have a long, flat-kneed trot, sometimes called \"daisy cutter\" movement, a phrase suggesting a good hunter could slice daisies in a field when it reaches its stride out. The over fences classes in [[show hunter]] competition are judged on the form of the horse, its manners and the smoothness of the course. A horse with good jumping form snaps its knees up and jumps with a good [[bascule (horse)|bascule]]. It should also be able to canter or gallop with control while having a stride long enough to make a proper number of strides over a given distance between fences. Hunter classes differ from jumper classes, in which they are not timed, and equitation classes, in which the rider's performance is the focus. Hunter style is based on fox hunting, so jumps in the hunter division are usually more natural colors than the jumps in a jumper division.\n* [[Eventing]], [[show jumping]] and [[dressage]], described under \"Olympic disciplines,\" above are all \"English\" riding disciplines that in North America sometimes are loosely classified within the \"hunt seat\" category.\n* [[Saddle seat]], is a primarily American discipline, though has recently become somewhat popular in [[South Africa]], was created to show to best advantage the animated movement of high-stepping and gaited breeds such as the [[American Saddlebred]] and the [[Tennessee Walking Horse|Tennessee Walker]]. [[Arabian horse|Arabians]] and [[Morgan horse|Morgans]] may also be shown saddle seat in the United States. There are usually three basic divisions. ''Park'' divisions are for the horses with the highest action. ''Pleasure'' divisions still emphasis animated action, but to a lesser degree, with manners ranking over animation. ''Plantation'' or ''Country'' divisions have the least amount of animation (in some breeds, the horses are flat-shod) and the greatest emphasis on manners.\n* [[Show hack]] is a competition seen primarily in the United Kingdom, Australia and other nations influenced by British traditions, featuring horses of elegant appearance, with excellent way of going and self-carriage. A related event is [[Riding horse (horse show)|riding horse]].\n\n==\"Western\" riding==\n{{Main|Western riding}}\n{{see also|Reining||Western pleasure|Rodeo|Cutting (sport)}}\n[[Western riding]] evolved from the cattle-working and warfare traditions brought to the Americas by the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Conquistadors]], and both equipment and riding style evolved to meet the working needs of the [[cowboy]] on [[ranch]]es in the [[American West]].\n\nThough the differences between English and Western riding appear dramatic, there are many similarities. Both styles require riders to have a solid seat, with the hips and shoulders balanced over the feet, with hands independent of the seat so as to avoid disturbing the balance of the horse and interfering with its performance.\n\nThe most noticeable feature of western style riding is in the saddle, which has a substantial [[saddle tree]] that provides support to horse and rider when working long hours in the saddle. The western saddle features a prominent pommel topped by a horn (a knob used for dallying a [[Lasso|lariat]] after roping an animal), a deep seat and a high cantle. The stirrups are wider and the saddle has rings and ties that allow objects to be attached to the saddle.\n\nWestern horses are asked to perform with a loose rein, controlled by one hand. The standard western bridle lacks a [[noseband]] and usually consists of a single set of reins attached to a [[curb bit]] that has somewhat longer and looser [[bit shank|shanks]] than the curb of an English [[double bridle|Weymouth]] bridle or a [[pelham bit]]. Two styles of Western [[rein]]s developed: The long split reins of the Texas tradition, which are completely separated, or the closed-end \"[[Romal]]\" reins of the California tradition, which have a long single attachment on the ends that can be used as a [[quirt]]. Modern [[rodeo]] competitors in timed events sometimes use a closed rein without a ''romal''.\n\nWestern riders wear a long-sleeved shirt, denim jeans, boots, and a wide-brimmed [[cowboy hat]]. [[Cowboy boot]]s, which have pointed toes and higher heels than a traditional riding boot, are designed to prevent the rider's foot from slipping through the stirrup during a fall, preventing the rider from being dragged\u2014most western saddles have no safety bars for the leathers or automatic stirrup release mechanism. A rider may wear protective leather leggings called [[chaps]]. Clean, well-fitting work clothing is the usual outfit seen in [[rodeo]], [[Cutting (sport)|cutting]] and [[reining]] competitions, especially for men, though sometimes both men and women wear brighter colors or finer fabrics for competition than for work.\n\nShow events such as [[Western pleasure]] use much flashier equipment, unlike the English traditions where clothing and tack is quiet and unobtrusive. Saddles, bits and bridles are ornamented with substantial amounts of silver. The rider may add a jacket or vest. Women's show clothing may feature vivid colors and even rhinestones or sequins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hobbyhorseinc.com/|title=Horse Show Apparel, Attire, Accessories|website=Hobby Horse Clothing Company, Inc.|accessdate=31 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nWestern horses are asked to have a brisk, ground-covering walk, but a slow, relaxed jog [[trot (horse gait)|trot]] that allows the rider to sit the saddle and not post. The Western version of the [[canter]] is called a ''lope'' and while collected and balanced, is expected to be slow and relaxed. Working western horses seldom use a sustained hand gallop, but must be able to accelerate quickly to high speed when chasing cattle or competing in [[reining]] events, must be able to stop quickly from a dead run and \"turn on a dime.\"\n\n==Harness==\n[[File:Welsh-A-Buggy.jpg|thumb|left|A Welsh pony in fine harness competition]]\n{{Main|Driving (horse)}}\nHorses, [[mule]]s and [[donkey]]s are driven in [[Horse harness|harness]] in many different ways. For working purposes, they can pull a [[plow]] or other [[farm]] equipment designed to be pulled by animals. In many parts of the world they still pull [[wagon]]s for basic hauling and transportation. They may draw [[carriage]]s at ceremonies, in parades or for tourist rides.\n\nAs noted in \"horse racing\" ''above'', horses can race in harness, pulling a very lightweight cart known as a [[sulky]]. At the other end of the spectrum, some [[draft horse]]s compete in [[horse pulling]] competitions, where single or teams of horses and their drivers vie to determine who can pull the most weight for a short distance.\n\nIn [[horse show]] competition, the following general categories of competition are seen:\n* [[Combined driving]], an internationally recognized competition where horses perform an arena-based \"dressage\" class where precision and control are emphasized, a cross-country \"marathon\" section that emphasizes fitness and endurance, and a \"stadium\" or \"cones\" obstacle course.\n* [[Draft horse showing]]: Most [[draft horse]] performance competition is done in harness.\n* [[Pleasure driving]]: Horses and ponies are usually hitched to a light cart shown at a walk and two speeds of trot, with an emphasis on manners.\n* [[Fine harness]]: Also called \"Formal driving,\" Horses are hitched to a light four-wheeled cart and shown in a manner that emphasizes flashy action and dramatic performance.\n* [[Roadster (horse)|Roadster]]: A horse show competition where exhibitors wear [[racing silks]] and ride in a sulky in a style akin to [[harness racing]], only without actually racing, but rather focusing on manners and performance.\n* [[Carriage]] driving, using somewhat larger two or four wheeled carriages, often restored [[antique]]s, judged on the turnout/neatness or suitability of horse and carriage.\n\n==Rodeo==\n{{main|Rodeo}}\n\nRodeo events include the following forms of competition:\n\n===Timed events===\n* [[Barrel racing]] and [[pole bending]] \u2013 the timed speed and agility events seen in [[rodeo]] as well as [[Gymkhana (Equestrian)|gymkhana]] or [[Gymkhana (Equestrian)|O-Mok-See]] competition. Both men and women compete in speed events at gymkhanas or O-Mok-Sees; however, at most professional, sanctioned rodeos, barrel racing is an exclusively women's sport. In a barrel race, horse and rider gallop around a cloverleaf pattern of barrels, making agile turns without knocking the barrels over. In pole bending, horse and rider run the length of a line of six upright poles, turn sharply and weave through the poles, turn again and weave back, then return to the start.\n* [[Steer wrestling]] \u2013 Also known as \"Bulldogging,\" this is a rodeo event where the rider jumps off his horse onto a steer and 'wrestles' it to the ground by grabbing it by the horns. This is probably the single most physically dangerous event in rodeo for the cowboy, who runs a high risk of jumping off a running horse head first and missing the steer or of having the thrown steer land on top of him, sometimes horns first.\n* [[Goat tying]] \u2013 usually an event for women or pre-teen girls and boys, a goat is staked out while a mounted rider runs to the goat, dismounts, grabs the goat, throws it to the ground and ties it in the same manner as a calf. This event was designed to teach smaller or younger riders the basics of calf roping without the more complex need to also lasso the animal.\n\n===Roping===\nRoping includes a number of timed events that are based on the real-life tasks of a working cowboy, who often had to capture calves and adult [[cattle]] for [[livestock branding|branding]], medical treatment and other purposes. A lasso or [[Lasso|lariat]] is thrown over the head of a [[calf (animal)|calf]] or the horns of adult cattle, and the animal is secured in a fashion dictated by its size and age.\n* [[Calf roping]], also called \"tie-down roping,\" is an event where a calf is roped around the neck by a [[Lasso|lariat]], the horse stops and sets back on the rope while the cowboy dismounts, runs to the calf, throws it to the ground and ties three feet together. (If the horse throws the calf, the cowboy must lose time waiting for the calf to get back to its feet so that the cowboy can do the work. The job of the horse is to hold the calf steady on the rope) This activity is still practiced on modern working ranches for [[brand]]ing, medical treatment, and so on.\n* [[Team roping]], also called \"heading and heeling,\" is the only rodeo event where men and women riders may compete together. Two people capture and restrain a full-grown steer. One horse and rider, the \"header,\" lassos a running steer's horns, while the other horse and rider, the \"heeler,\" lassos the steer's two hind legs. Once the animal is captured, the riders face each other and lightly pull the steer between them, so that it loses its balance, thus in the real world allowing restraint for treatment.\n* [[Breakaway roping]] \u2013 an easier form of calf roping where a very short lariat is used, tied lightly to the saddle horn with string and a flag. When the calf is roped, the horse stops, allowing the calf to run on, flagging the end of time when the string and flag breaks from the saddle. In the United States, this event is primarily for women of all ages and boys under 12, while in some nations where traditional calf roping is frowned upon, riders of both genders compete.\n\n===\"Rough Stock\" competition===\n[[File:Horses abreast IMG 5342.jpg|thumb|Small herd of rough stock in Texas.]]\nIn spite of popular myth, most modern \"broncs\" are not in fact wild horses, but are more commonly spoiled riding horses{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} or horses bred specifically as bucking stock.\n* Bronc riding \u2013 there are two divisions in rodeo, [[bareback bronc]] riding, where the rider rides a bucking horse holding onto a leather [[surcingle]] or rigging with only one hand, and [[saddle bronc]] riding, where the rider rides a modified western saddle without a horn (for safety) while holding onto a braided lead rope attached to the horse's halter.\n* Bull Riding \u2013 though technically not an equestrian event, as the cowboys ride full-grown bulls instead of horses, skills similar to bareback bronc riding are required.\n\n===International rodeo===\n* [[Australian rodeo]]\n* [[Chilean rodeo]]\n* [[Charreada]]\n\n==Other equestrian activities==\n[[File:PoloGirlsHorses.jpg|thumb|Girls and their horses preparing for a [[polo]] game]]\nThere are many other forms of equestrian activity and sports seen worldwide. There are both competitive events and [[pleasure riding]] disciplines available.\n\n===Arena sports===\n* Arena [[polo]] and [[Cowboy polo]]\n* [[Pato]] (Argentina's national sport)\n* [[Equestrian vaulting]]: In vaulting, a [[surcingle]] with two hoops at the top is attached around a horse's [[horse anatomy|barrel]]. The horse also wears a [[bridle]] with [[side reins]]. The vaulter is [[longeing|longed]] on the horse, and performs [[gymnastics|gymnastic]] movements while the horse walks, trots, and canters.\n* [[Gymkhana (Equestrian)|Gymkhana]], competition of timed pattern games, also known as ''O-Mok-See'' in the western United States.\n\n===Horse sports that use cattle===\n* [[Bullfighting]] (''[[rejoneador|rejoneo]]'')\n**[[Portuguese-style bullfighting]]\n**[[Spanish-style bullfighting]]\n* [[Campdrafting]], a type of cattle-working competition popular in [[Australia]]\n* [[Cutting (sport)|Cutting]]\n* [[Team penning]]\n* [[Working cow horse]]\n\n===Defined area sports===\n* [[Buzkashi]], a sport originating on the [[steppes]] of central [[Asia]], now the national sport of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]].\n* [[Cowboy mounted shooting]]\n* [[Horseball]]\n* [[Jousting]] and [[Skill at Arms]], events involving use of lances, swords and completion of obstacles. There are stand-alone competitions and also are often seen at [[historical reenactment]]s, [[Renaissance Fair]]s and [[Society for Creative Anachronism]] events.\n* [[Mounted archery]]\n** [[Yabusame]]\n* [[Mounted Games]], a sport where games are played in a relay-style with two to five members per team at very high speed\n* [[Polo]], a team game played on horses, involves riders using a long-handled [[mallet]] to drive a ball on the ground into the opposing team's [[goal (sport)|goal]] while the opposing team defends their goal\n* [[Polocrosse]]\n* [[Tent pegging]]\n\n===Cross-country sports===\n* [[Competitive Mounted Orienteering]], a form of orienteering on horses (but unrelated to [[orienteering]]) \u2013 consists of three stages: following a precise route marked on a map, negotiation of obstacles and control of paces.\n* [[Techniques de Randonn\u00e9e \u00c9questre de Comp\u00e9tition|Le Trec]], which comprises three phases \u2013 trail riding, with jumping and correct basic flatwork. Le Trec, which is very popular in Europe, tests the partnership's ability to cope with an all-day ride across varied terrain, route finding, negotiating natural obstacles and hazards, while considering the welfare of the horse, respecting the countryside and enjoying all it has to offer.\n* [[Competitive trail riding]], a [[pace race]] held across terrain similar to [[endurance riding]], but shorter in length (25 \u2013 {{convert|35|mi|km}}, depending on class). Being a form of [[pace race]], the objective is not to finish in the least time. Instead, as in other forms of [[judged trail ride|judged trail riding]], each competitor is graded on everything including physical condition, campsite and horse management. Horsemanship also is considered, including how the rider handles the trail and how horse is handled and presented to the judge and vet throughout the ride. The horse is graded on performance, manners, etc. \"Pulse and respiration\" stops check the horse's recovery ability. The judges also set up obstacles along the trail and the horse and rider are graded on how well they perform as a team. The whole point is the partnership between the horse and rider.\n* [[Cross Country Jumping]], a jumping course that contains logs and natural obstacles mostly. The common clothes worn are usually brighter colors and less conservative.\n* [[Endurance riding]], a competition usually of 50 to {{convert|100|mi|km}} or more, over mountainous or other natural terrain, with scheduled stops to take the horses' vital signs, check soundness and verify that the horse is fit to continue. The first horse to finish and be confirmed by the veterinarian as fit to continue is the winner. Additional awards are usually given to the best-conditioned horses who finish in the top 10.\n* [[Fox hunting]]\n* Hacking, or [[pleasure riding]].\n* [[Hunter Pacing]] is a sport where a horse and rider team travel a trail at speeds based the ideal conditions for the horse, with competitors seeking to ride closest to that perfect time. Hunter paces are usually held in a series. Hunter paces are usually a few miles long and covered mostly at a canter or gallop. The horsemanship and management skills of the rider are also considered in the scoring, and periodic stops are required for veterinarians to check the vital signs and overall soundness of the horses.\n* [[Ride and Tie]] is a form of [[endurance riding]] in which teams of 3 (two humans and one horse) alternate running and riding.\n* [[steeplechase (horse racing)|Steeplechase]], a distance horse race with diverse fence and ditch obstacles.\n* [[Trail Riding]], pleasure riding any breed horse, any style across the land.\n\n==Health issues==\nHandling, riding and driving horses have inherent risks. Horses are large prey animals with a well-developed [[flight or fight instinct]] able to move quickly and unexpectedly.  When mounted, the rider's head may be up to {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the ground, and the horse may travel at a speed of up to {{convert|65|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| author = J R Silver\n| title = Spinal injuries resulting from horse riding accidents\n| journal = Spinal Cord\n| volume = 40\n| pages = 264\u201371\n| date = June 2002\n| doi= 10.1038/sj.sc.3101280\n| pmid = 12037707\n| issue = 6}}</ref> The injuries observed range from very minor injuries to fatalities.\n\nA study in [[Germany]] reported that the [[relative risk]] of injury from riding a horse, compared to riding a bicycle, was 9 times higher for [[adolescent]]s and 5.6 times higher for younger [[child]]ren, but that riding a horse was less risky than riding a [[moped]].<ref name=\"pmid17426559\">{{cite journal\n|vauthors=Schneiders W, Rollow A, Rammelt S, Grass R, Holch M, Serra A, Richter S, Gruner EM, Schlag B, Roesner D, Zwipp H | title = Risk-inducing activities leading to injuries in a child and adolescent population of Germany\n| journal = [[Journal of Trauma]]\n| volume = 62\n| issue = 4\n| pages = 996\u20131003\n|date=April 2007\n| pmid = 17426559\n| doi = 10.1097/01.ta.0000222584.48001.a0\n| issn =\n}}</ref> In [[Victoria, Australia]], a search of state records found that equestrian sports had the third highest incidence of serious injury, after [[motor sport]]s and [[power boat]]ing.<ref name=\"pmid16046347\">{{cite journal\n|vauthors=Gabbe BJ, Finch CF, Cameron PA, Williamson OD | title = Incidence of serious injury and death during sport and recreation activities in Victoria, Australia\n| journal = [[British Journal of Sports Medicine]]\n| volume = 39\n| issue = 8\n| pages = 573\u201377\n|date=August 2005\n| pmid = 16046347\n| pmc = 1725286\n| doi = 10.1136/bjsm.2004.015750\n| issn =\n}}</ref> In [[Greece]], an analysis of a national registry estimated the incidence of equestrian injury to be 21 per 100,000 person-years for farming and equestrian sports combined, and 160 times higher for [[horse racing]] personnel.

It is inextricably associated with [[gambling]], where in certain events, stakes can become very high. Despite its illegality in most competitions, these conditions of extreme competitiveness can lead to the use of performing-enhancing drugs and extreme training techniques, which can result in negative side effects for the horses' well-being.\nThe races themselves have also proved dangerous to the horses \u2013 especially [[Steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechasing]], which requires the horse to jump hurdles whilst galloping at full speed. This can result in injury or death to the horse, as well as the jockey.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/705194.stm | work=BBC News | title=Should steeplechases be banned? | date=2000-04-17}}</ref> A study by animal welfare group [[Animal Aid]] revealed that approximately 375 racehorses die yearly, with 30% of these either during or as a result of injuries from a race.<ref name=\"animalaid\">{{cite web |url=http://www.animalaid.org.uk/h/n/AA/HOME/ALL/1665// |title=Bred To Death: Background Notes |publisher=Animal Aid |accessdate=2013-07-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510144228/http://www.animalaid.org.uk/h/n/AA/HOME/ALL/1665// |archivedate=2013-05-10 }}</ref> The report also highlighted the increasing frequency of race-related illnesses, including bleeding lungs (exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage) and gastric ulcers.<ref name=\"animalaid\" />\n\nAnimal rights groups are also primarily concerned that certain sports or training exercises may cause unnecessary pain or injuries to horse athletes. Some specific training or showing practices are so widely condemned that they have been made illegal at the national level and violations can incur criminal penalties. The most well-known is ''soring,'' a practice of applying a caustic ointment just above the hooves of a [[Tennessee Walking Horse]] to make it pick up its feet higher. However, in spite of a federal law in the United States prohibiting this practice and routine inspections of horse shows by inspectors from the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], soring is still widespread and difficult to eliminate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health/lameness/soring_030706/|title=EQUUS Special Report: Why Soring Persists|accessdate=31 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909111123/http://www.equisearch.com/article/soring_030706|archivedate=9 September 2014}}</ref> Some events themselves are also considered so abusive that they are banned in many countries. Among these are horse-tripping, a sport where riders chase and rope a loose-running horse by its front legs, throwing it to the ground.<ref>[http://www.idausa.org/facts/horsetripping.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315182541/http://www.idausa.org/facts/horsetripping.html |date=March 15, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nSecondary effects of racing have also recently been uncovered.

This broad description includes the use of horses for practical [[working animal|working]] purposes, transportation, recreational activities, artistic or cultural exercises, and [[animals in sport|competitive sport]].\n\n==Overview of equestrian activities==\nHorses are [[horse training|trained]] and ridden for practical working purposes, such as in [[Mounted police|police work]] or for controlling herd animals on a [[ranch]]. They are also used in [[Horse#Sport|competitive sports]] including [[dressage]], [[endurance riding]], [[eventing]], [[reining]], [[show jumping]], [[tent pegging]], [[equestrian vaulting|vaulting]], [[polo]], [[horse racing]], [[driving (horse)|driving]], and [[rodeo]] (see additional equestrian sports listed later in this article for more examples).  Some popular forms of competition are grouped together at [[horse show]]s where horses perform in a wide variety of disciplines. Horses (and other [[equid]]s such as [[mule]]s) are used for non-competitive recreational riding such as [[fox hunting]], [[trail riding]], or hacking. There is public access to horse trails in almost every part of the world; many parks, [[ranch]]es, and public [[stable]]s offer both guided and independent riding. Horses are also used for [[therapeutic horseback riding|therapeutic]] purposes both in specialized para-equestrian competition as well as non-competitive riding to improve human health and emotional development.\n\n[[Horses]] are also [[driving (horse)|driven]] in [[harness racing]], at [[horse show|horse shows,]] and in other types of exhibition such as [[historical reenactment]] or ceremony, often pulling [[carriage]]s. In some parts of the world, they are still used for practical purposes such as [[farm]]ing.\n\nHorses continue to be used in public service, in traditional ceremonies (parades, funerals), [[police horse|police]] and volunteer mounted patrols and for [[mounted search and rescue]].\n\n[[Riding hall]]s enable the training of horse and rider in all weathers as well as indoor competition riding.\n\n==History of horse use==\n[[File:Cave painting in Doushe cave, Lorstan, Iran, 8th millennium BC.JPG|thumb|Prehistoric cave painting, depicting a horse and rider]]\n{{Main|Domestication of the horse|Horses in warfare}}\nThough there is controversy over the exact date horses were [[domestication|domesticated]] and when they were first ridden, the best estimate is that horses first were ridden approximately 3500 BC. Indirect evidence suggests that horses were ridden long before they were driven. There is some evidence that about 3,000 BC, near the [[Dnieper River]] and the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]], people were using [[Bit (horse)|bits]] on horses, as a stallion that was buried there shows teeth wear consistent with using a bit.<ref name=Chamberlin69>Chamberlin, J. Edward ''Horse: How the Horse has Shaped Civilization'' New York:BlueBridge 2006 {{ISBN|0-9742405-9-1}}</ref> However, the most unequivocal early [[archeology|archaeological]] evidence of equines put to working use was of horses being driven. [[Chariot]] burials about 2500 BC present the most direct hard evidence of horses used as [[working animal]]s. In ancient times chariot warfare was followed by the use of [[horses in warfare|war horses]] as light and heavy [[cavalry]]. The horse played an important role throughout human history all over the world, both in warfare and in peaceful pursuits such as [[transportation]], [[trade]] and [[agriculture]]. Horses lived in North America, but died out at the end of the [[Ice Age]]. Horses were brought back to North America by European explorers, beginning with the second voyage of [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] in 1493.<ref>Bennett, Deb (1998) 'Conquerors: The Roots of New World Horsemanship.'' Amigo Publications Inc; 1st edition. {{ISBN|0-9658533-0-6}}, p. 151</ref> Equestrianism was introduced in the [[1900 Summer Olympics]] as an Olympic sport with jumping events.\n\n==Horse racing==\n{{Main|Horse racing|Harness racing|Parimutuel gambling}}\nHumans appear to have long expressed a desire to know which horse or horses were the fastest, and [[horse racing]] has ancient roots. [[Gambling]] on horse races appears to go hand-in hand with racing and has a long history as well. [[Thoroughbred]]s have the pre-eminent reputation as a racing breed, but other breeds also race.\n\n===Types of horse racing===\nUnder saddle:\n* [[Thoroughbred horse racing]] is the most popular form worldwide. In the UK, it is known as [[flat racing]] and is governed by the [[Jockey Club]] in the United Kingdom. In the US, horse racing is governed by [[The Jockey Club]]. other light breeds are also raced worldwide.\n* [[Steeplechase (horse racing)|Steeplechasing]] involves racing on a track where the horses also jump over obstacles. It is most common in the UK, where it is also called [[National Hunt]] racing.\n\nIn harness:\n* Both light and heavy breeds as well as ponies are raced in harness with a [[sulky]] or racing bike. The [[Standardbred]] dominates the sport in both [[trot (horse gait)|trotting]] and [[Pacing (horse gait)|pacing]] varieties.\n* The United States Trotting Association organizes [[harness racing]] in the United States.\n* Harness racing is also found throughout Europe, New Zealand and Australia.\n\nDistance racing:\n\n* [[Endurance riding]], takes place over a given, measured distance and the horses have an even start.  Top level races are usually {{convert|50|to|100|mi|km}}, over mountainous or other natural terrain, with scheduled stops to take the horses' vital signs, check soundness and verify that the horse is fit to continue. The first horse to finish and be confirmed by the veterinarian as fit to continue is the winner. Limited distance rides of about {{convert|25|-|20|mi}} are offered to newcomers. Variants include [[Ride and Tie]] and various forms of [[long riding]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Nagy|first=Annamaria|last2=Dyson|first2=Sue|last3=Murray|first3=Jane|date=18 June 2012|year=|title=A veterinary review of endurance riding as an international competitive sport.|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sue_Dyson3/publication/229435826_A_veterinary_review_of_endurance_riding_as_an_international_competitive_sport/links/5be003c892851c6b27a79f06/A-veterinary-review-of-endurance-riding-as-an-international-competitive-sport.pdf|journal=The Veterinary Journal|language=English|volume=|issue=194|pages=288-293|doi=|issn=|via=Elsevier}}</ref>\n\n==International and Olympic disciplines==\n{{Main|Equestrian at the Olympics|International Federation for Equestrian Sports}}\nEquestrian events were first included in the modern [[Olympic Games]] in 1900. By 1912, all three Olympic disciplines still seen today were part of the games. The following forms of competition are recognized worldwide and are a part of the [[Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|equestrian events]] at the Olympics. They are governed by the rules of the [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports]] (FEI).\n* [[Dressage]] (\"training\" in [[French language|French]]) involves the progressive training of the horse to a high level of [[impulsion]], [[collection (horse)|collection]] and obedience.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dressage-academy.com/training/dressage/|title=What is Dressage? \u2013 Dressage Academy Training|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref> Competitive dressage has the goal of showing the horse carrying out, on request, the natural movements that it performs without thinking while running loose.\n* [[Show jumping]] comprises a timed event judged on the ability of the horse and rider to jump over a series of obstacles, in a given order and with the fewest refusals or knockdowns of portions of the obstacles.\n* [[Eventing]], also called ''combined training'', ''horse trials'', the ''three-day event'', ''the Military'' or ''the complete test'', puts together the obedience of dressage with the athletic ability of show jumping, the fitness demands the [[cross-country equestrianism|cross-country jumping]] phase. In the last-named, the horses jump over fixed obstacles, such as logs, stone walls, [[bank (obstacle)|banks]], [[ditch (obstacle)|ditches]] and [[water (obstacle)|water]], trying to finish the course under the \"optimum time.\" There was also the 'Steeple Chase' Phase, which is now excluded from most major competitions to bring them in line with the Olympic standard.\n\nThe additional internationally sanctioned but non-Olympic disciplines governed by the [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|FEI]] are: [[combined driving]]; [[endurance riding|endurance]]; [[reining]]; and [[equestrian vaulting|vaulting]]. These disciplines are part of the [[FEI World Equestrian Games]] every four years and may hold their own individual World Championships in other years. The FEI also recognizes [[horseball]] and [[tent pegging]] as its two regional disciplines.\n\n===Para-equestrian disciplines===\n[[Para-equestrian]] competition at the international level, including the [[Equestrian at the Summer Paralympics|Paralympics]], are also governed by the FEI and offer the following competition events:\n* Para-Equestrian Dressage is conducted under the same rules as conventional Dressage, but with riders divided into different competition grades based on their functional abilities.<ref>[http://www.fei.org/disciplines/dressage/about-para-equestrian-dressage ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508135709/http://www.fei.org/disciplines/dressage/about-para-equestrian-dressage |date=May 8, 2013 }}</ref>\n* Para-Equestrian Driving places competitors in grades based on their skill.<ref>[http://www.fei.org/disciplines/driving/about-para-equestrian-driving ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501195554/http://www.fei.org/disciplines/driving/about-para-equestrian-driving |date=May 1, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Haute \u00c9cole==\n{{Main|Classical dressage}}\nThe ''haute \u00e9cole'' ([[French language|F.]] \"high school\"), an advanced component of [[Classical dressage]], is a highly refined set of skills seldom used in competition but often seen in demonstration performances.\n\nThe world's leading Classical dressage programs include:\n* The [[Cadre Noir]] in [[Saumur]], [[France]].\n* The [[Spanish Riding School]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].\n* The [[Portuguese School of Equestrian Art]] at [[Queluz National Palace]], [[Portugal]].\n* The [[Royal Andalusian School of Equestrian Art]] in [[Jerez de la Frontera]], [[Spain]].\n\nOther major classical teams include the [[South African Lipizzaners]] and the [[Hollandsche Manege]] of the [[Netherlands]].\n\n==Horse shows==\n{{Main|Horse show}}\n\n[[Horse show]]s are held throughout the world with a tremendous variety of possible events, equipment, attire and judging standards used. However, most forms of horse show competition can be broken into the following broad categories:\n* [[Equitation]], sometimes called ''seat and hands'' or ''horsemanship'', refers to events where the rider is judged on form, style and ability.\n* ''Pleasure, flat'' or ''under saddle'' classes feature horses who are ridden on the flat (not jumped) and judged on manners, performance, movement, style and quality.\n* ''Halter, in-hand breeding'' or ''conformation'' classes, where the horse is led by a handler on the ground and judged on conformation and suitability as a breeding animal.\n* ''Harness'' classes, where the horse is [[Driving (horse)|driven]] rather than ridden, but still judged on manners, performance and quality.\n* ''Jumping'' or ''Over Fences'' refers broadly to both [[show jumping]] and [[show hunter]], where horses and riders must jump obstacles.\n\n==\"English\" riding==\n{{Main|English riding}}\nIn addition to the classical Olympic events, the following forms of competition are seen. In North America they are referred to as \"[[English riding]]\" in contrast with western riding; elsewhere in the world, if a distinction is necessary, they are usually described as \"classic riding\":\n* [[Hunt seat]] or [[Show hunter|Hunter]] classes judge the movement and the form of horses suitable for work over fences. A typical [[show hunter]] division would include classes over fences as well as \"Hunter under Saddle\" or \"flat\" classes (sometimes called \"hack\" classes), in which the horse is judged on its performance, manners and movement without having to jump. Hunters have a long, flat-kneed trot, sometimes called \"daisy cutter\" movement, a phrase suggesting a good hunter could slice daisies in a field when it reaches its stride out. The over fences classes in [[show hunter]] competition are judged on the form of the horse, its manners and the smoothness of the course. A horse with good jumping form snaps its knees up and jumps with a good [[bascule (horse)|bascule]]. It should also be able to canter or gallop with control while having a stride long enough to make a proper number of strides over a given distance between fences. Hunter classes differ from jumper classes, in which they are not timed, and equitation classes, in which the rider's performance is the focus. Hunter style is based on fox hunting, so jumps in the hunter division are usually more natural colors than the jumps in a jumper division.\n* [[Eventing]], [[show jumping]] and [[dressage]], described under \"Olympic disciplines,\" above are all \"English\" riding disciplines that in North America sometimes are loosely classified within the \"hunt seat\" category.\n* [[Saddle seat]], is a primarily American discipline, though has recently become somewhat popular in [[South Africa]], was created to show to best advantage the animated movement of high-stepping and gaited breeds such as the [[American Saddlebred]] and the [[Tennessee Walking Horse|Tennessee Walker]]. [[Arabian horse|Arabians]] and [[Morgan horse|Morgans]] may also be shown saddle seat in the United States. There are usually three basic divisions. ''Park'' divisions are for the horses with the highest action. ''Pleasure'' divisions still emphasis animated action, but to a lesser degree, with manners ranking over animation. ''Plantation'' or ''Country'' divisions have the least amount of animation (in some breeds, the horses are flat-shod) and the greatest emphasis on manners.\n* [[Show hack]] is a competition seen primarily in the United Kingdom, Australia and other nations influenced by British traditions, featuring horses of elegant appearance, with excellent way of going and self-carriage. A related event is [[Riding horse (horse show)|riding horse]].\n\n==\"Western\" riding==\n{{Main|Western riding}}\n{{see also|Reining||Western pleasure|Rodeo|Cutting (sport)}}\n[[Western riding]] evolved from the cattle-working and warfare traditions brought to the Americas by the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Conquistadors]], and both equipment and riding style evolved to meet the working needs of the [[cowboy]] on [[ranch]]es in the [[American West]].\n\nThough the differences between English and Western riding appear dramatic, there are many similarities. Both styles require riders to have a solid seat, with the hips and shoulders balanced over the feet, with hands independent of the seat so as to avoid disturbing the balance of the horse and interfering with its performance.\n\nThe most noticeable feature of western style riding is in the saddle, which has a substantial [[saddle tree]] that provides support to horse and rider when working long hours in the saddle. The western saddle features a prominent pommel topped by a horn (a knob used for dallying a [[Lasso|lariat]] after roping an animal), a deep seat and a high cantle. The stirrups are wider and the saddle has rings and ties that allow objects to be attached to the saddle.\n\nWestern horses are asked to perform with a loose rein, controlled by one hand. The standard western bridle lacks a [[noseband]] and usually consists of a single set of reins attached to a [[curb bit]] that has somewhat longer and looser [[bit shank|shanks]] than the curb of an English [[double bridle|Weymouth]] bridle or a [[pelham bit]]. Two styles of Western [[rein]]s developed: The long split reins of the Texas tradition, which are completely separated, or the closed-end \"[[Romal]]\" reins of the California tradition, which have a long single attachment on the ends that can be used as a [[quirt]]. Modern [[rodeo]] competitors in timed events sometimes use a closed rein without a ''romal''.\n\nWestern riders wear a long-sleeved shirt, denim jeans, boots, and a wide-brimmed [[cowboy hat]]. [[Cowboy boot]]s, which have pointed toes and higher heels than a traditional riding boot, are designed to prevent the rider's foot from slipping through the stirrup during a fall, preventing the rider from being dragged\u2014most western saddles have no safety bars for the leathers or automatic stirrup release mechanism. A rider may wear protective leather leggings called [[chaps]]. Clean, well-fitting work clothing is the usual outfit seen in [[rodeo]], [[Cutting (sport)|cutting]] and [[reining]] competitions, especially for men, though sometimes both men and women wear brighter colors or finer fabrics for competition than for work.\n\nShow events such as [[Western pleasure]] use much flashier equipment, unlike the English traditions where clothing and tack is quiet and unobtrusive. Saddles, bits and bridles are ornamented with substantial amounts of silver. The rider may add a jacket or vest. Women's show clothing may feature vivid colors and even rhinestones or sequins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hobbyhorseinc.com/|title=Horse Show Apparel, Attire, Accessories|website=Hobby Horse Clothing Company, Inc.|accessdate=31 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nWestern horses are asked to have a brisk, ground-covering walk, but a slow, relaxed jog [[trot (horse gait)|trot]] that allows the rider to sit the saddle and not post. The Western version of the [[canter]] is called a ''lope'' and while collected and balanced, is expected to be slow and relaxed. Working western horses seldom use a sustained hand gallop, but must be able to accelerate quickly to high speed when chasing cattle or competing in [[reining]] events, must be able to stop quickly from a dead run and \"turn on a dime.\"\n\n==Harness==\n[[File:Welsh-A-Buggy.jpg|thumb|left|A Welsh pony in fine harness competition]]\n{{Main|Driving (horse)}}\nHorses, [[mule]]s and [[donkey]]s are driven in [[Horse harness|harness]] in many different ways. For working purposes, they can pull a [[plow]] or other [[farm]] equipment designed to be pulled by animals. In many parts of the world they still pull [[wagon]]s for basic hauling and transportation. They may draw [[carriage]]s at ceremonies, in parades or for tourist rides.\n\nAs noted in \"horse racing\" ''above'', horses can race in harness, pulling a very lightweight cart known as a [[sulky]]. At the other end of the spectrum, some [[draft horse]]s compete in [[horse pulling]] competitions, where single or teams of horses and their drivers vie to determine who can pull the most weight for a short distance.\n\nIn [[horse show]] competition, the following general categories of competition are seen:\n* [[Combined driving]], an internationally recognized competition where horses perform an arena-based \"dressage\" class where precision and control are emphasized, a cross-country \"marathon\" section that emphasizes fitness and endurance, and a \"stadium\" or \"cones\" obstacle course.\n* [[Draft horse showing]]: Most [[draft horse]] performance competition is done in harness.\n* [[Pleasure driving]]: Horses and ponies are usually hitched to a light cart shown at a walk and two speeds of trot, with an emphasis on manners.\n* [[Fine harness]]: Also called \"Formal driving,\" Horses are hitched to a light four-wheeled cart and shown in a manner that emphasizes flashy action and dramatic performance.\n* [[Roadster (horse)|Roadster]]: A horse show competition where exhibitors wear [[racing silks]] and ride in a sulky in a style akin to [[harness racing]], only without actually racing, but rather focusing on manners and performance.\n* [[Carriage]] driving, using somewhat larger two or four wheeled carriages, often restored [[antique]]s, judged on the turnout/neatness or suitability of horse and carriage.\n\n==Rodeo==\n{{main|Rodeo}}\n\nRodeo events include the following forms of competition:\n\n===Timed events===\n* [[Barrel racing]] and [[pole bending]] \u2013 the timed speed and agility events seen in [[rodeo]] as well as [[Gymkhana (Equestrian)|gymkhana]] or [[Gymkhana (Equestrian)|O-Mok-See]] competition. Both men and women compete in speed events at gymkhanas or O-Mok-Sees; however, at most professional, sanctioned rodeos, barrel racing is an exclusively women's sport. In a barrel race, horse and rider gallop around a cloverleaf pattern of barrels, making agile turns without knocking the barrels over. In pole bending, horse and rider run the length of a line of six upright poles, turn sharply and weave through the poles, turn again and weave back, then return to the start.\n* [[Steer wrestling]] \u2013 Also known as \"Bulldogging,\" this is a rodeo event where the rider jumps off his horse onto a steer and 'wrestles' it to the ground by grabbing it by the horns. This is probably the single most physically dangerous event in rodeo for the cowboy, who runs a high risk of jumping off a running horse head first and missing the steer or of having the thrown steer land on top of him, sometimes horns first.\n* [[Goat tying]] \u2013 usually an event for women or pre-teen girls and boys, a goat is staked out while a mounted rider runs to the goat, dismounts, grabs the goat, throws it to the ground and ties it in the same manner as a calf. This event was designed to teach smaller or younger riders the basics of calf roping without the more complex need to also lasso the animal.\n\n===Roping===\nRoping includes a number of timed events that are based on the real-life tasks of a working cowboy, who often had to capture calves and adult [[cattle]] for [[livestock branding|branding]], medical treatment and other purposes. A lasso or [[Lasso|lariat]] is thrown over the head of a [[calf (animal)|calf]] or the horns of adult cattle, and the animal is secured in a fashion dictated by its size and age.\n* [[Calf roping]], also called \"tie-down roping,\" is an event where a calf is roped around the neck by a [[Lasso|lariat]], the horse stops and sets back on the rope while the cowboy dismounts, runs to the calf, throws it to the ground and ties three feet together. (If the horse throws the calf, the cowboy must lose time waiting for the calf to get back to its feet so that the cowboy can do the work. The job of the horse is to hold the calf steady on the rope) This activity is still practiced on modern working ranches for [[brand]]ing, medical treatment, and so on.\n* [[Team roping]], also called \"heading and heeling,\" is the only rodeo event where men and women riders may compete together. Two people capture and restrain a full-grown steer. One horse and rider, the \"header,\" lassos a running steer's horns, while the other horse and rider, the \"heeler,\" lassos the steer's two hind legs. Once the animal is captured, the riders face each other and lightly pull the steer between them, so that it loses its balance, thus in the real world allowing restraint for treatment.\n* [[Breakaway roping]] \u2013 an easier form of calf roping where a very short lariat is used, tied lightly to the saddle horn with string and a flag. When the calf is roped, the horse stops, allowing the calf to run on, flagging the end of time when the string and flag breaks from the saddle. In the United States, this event is primarily for women of all ages and boys under 12, while in some nations where traditional calf roping is frowned upon, riders of both genders compete.\n\n===\"Rough Stock\" competition===\n[[File:Horses abreast IMG 5342.jpg|thumb|Small herd of rough stock in Texas.]]\nIn spite of popular myth, most modern \"broncs\" are not in fact wild horses, but are more commonly spoiled riding horses{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} or horses bred specifically as bucking stock.\n* Bronc riding \u2013 there are two divisions in rodeo, [[bareback bronc]] riding, where the rider rides a bucking horse holding onto a leather [[surcingle]] or rigging with only one hand, and [[saddle bronc]] riding, where the rider rides a modified western saddle without a horn (for safety) while holding onto a braided lead rope attached to the horse's halter.\n* Bull Riding \u2013 though technically not an equestrian event, as the cowboys ride full-grown bulls instead of horses, skills similar to bareback bronc riding are required.\n\n===International rodeo===\n* [[Australian rodeo]]\n* [[Chilean rodeo]]\n* [[Charreada]]\n\n==Other equestrian activities==\n[[File:PoloGirlsHorses.jpg|thumb|Girls and their horses preparing for a [[polo]] game]]\nThere are many other forms of equestrian activity and sports seen worldwide. There are both competitive events and [[pleasure riding]] disciplines available.\n\n===Arena sports===\n* Arena [[polo]] and [[Cowboy polo]]\n* [[Pato]] (Argentina's national sport)\n* [[Equestrian vaulting]]: In vaulting, a [[surcingle]] with two hoops at the top is attached around a horse's [[horse anatomy|barrel]]. The horse also wears a [[bridle]] with [[side reins]]. The vaulter is [[longeing|longed]] on the horse, and performs [[gymnastics|gymnastic]] movements while the horse walks, trots, and canters.\n* [[Gymkhana (Equestrian)|Gymkhana]], competition of timed pattern games, also known as ''O-Mok-See'' in the western United States.\n\n===Horse sports that use cattle===\n* [[Bullfighting]] (''[[rejoneador|rejoneo]]'')\n**[[Portuguese-style bullfighting]]\n**[[Spanish-style bullfighting]]\n* [[Campdrafting]], a type of cattle-working competition popular in [[Australia]]\n* [[Cutting (sport)|Cutting]]\n* [[Team penning]]\n* [[Working cow horse]]\n\n===Defined area sports===\n* [[Buzkashi]], a sport originating on the [[steppes]] of central [[Asia]], now the national sport of [[Afghanistan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]].\n* [[Cowboy mounted shooting]]\n* [[Horseball]]\n* [[Jousting]] and [[Skill at Arms]], events involving use of lances, swords and completion of obstacles. There are stand-alone competitions and also are often seen at [[historical reenactment]]s, [[Renaissance Fair]]s and [[Society for Creative Anachronism]] events.\n* [[Mounted archery]]\n** [[Yabusame]]\n* [[Mounted Games]], a sport where games are played in a relay-style with two to five members per team at very high speed\n* [[Polo]], a team game played on horses, involves riders using a long-handled [[mallet]] to drive a ball on the ground into the opposing team's [[goal (sport)|goal]] while the opposing team defends their goal\n* [[Polocrosse]]\n* [[Tent pegging]]\n\n===Cross-country sports===\n* [[Competitive Mounted Orienteering]], a form of orienteering on horses (but unrelated to [[orienteering]]) \u2013 consists of three stages: following a precise route marked on a map, negotiation of obstacles and control of paces.\n* [[Techniques de Randonn\u00e9e \u00c9questre de Comp\u00e9tition|Le Trec]], which comprises three phases \u2013 trail riding, with jumping and correct basic flatwork. Le Trec, which is very popular in Europe, tests the partnership's ability to cope with an all-day ride across varied terrain, route finding, negotiating natural obstacles and hazards, while considering the welfare of the horse, respecting the countryside and enjoying all it has to offer.\n* [[Competitive trail riding]], a [[pace race]] held across terrain similar to [[endurance riding]], but shorter in length (25 \u2013 {{convert|35|mi|km}}, depending on class). Being a form of [[pace race]], the objective is not to finish in the least time. Instead, as in other forms of [[judged trail ride|judged trail riding]], each competitor is graded on everything including physical condition, campsite and horse management. Horsemanship also is considered, including how the rider handles the trail and how horse is handled and presented to the judge and vet throughout the ride. The horse is graded on performance, manners, etc. \"Pulse and respiration\" stops check the horse's recovery ability. The judges also set up obstacles along the trail and the horse and rider are graded on how well they perform as a team. The whole point is the partnership between the horse and rider.\n* [[Cross Country Jumping]], a jumping course that contains logs and natural obstacles mostly. The common clothes worn are usually brighter colors and less conservative.\n* [[Endurance riding]], a competition usually of 50 to {{convert|100|mi|km}} or more, over mountainous or other natural terrain, with scheduled stops to take the horses' vital signs, check soundness and verify that the horse is fit to continue. The first horse to finish and be confirmed by the veterinarian as fit to continue is the winner. Additional awards are usually given to the best-conditioned horses who finish in the top 10.\n* [[Fox hunting]]\n* Hacking, or [[pleasure riding]].\n* [[Hunter Pacing]] is a sport where a horse and rider team travel a trail at speeds based the ideal conditions for the horse, with competitors seeking to ride closest to that perfect time. Hunter paces are usually held in a series. Hunter paces are usually a few miles long and covered mostly at a canter or gallop. The horsemanship and management skills of the rider are also considered in the scoring, and periodic stops are required for veterinarians to check the vital signs and overall soundness of the horses.\n* [[Ride and Tie]] is a form of [[endurance riding]] in which teams of 3 (two humans and one horse) alternate running and riding.\n* [[steeplechase (horse racing)|Steeplechase]], a distance horse race with diverse fence and ditch obstacles.\n* [[Trail Riding]], pleasure riding any breed horse, any style across the land.\n\n==Health issues==\nHandling, riding and driving horses have inherent risks. Horses are large prey animals with a well-developed [[flight or fight instinct]] able to move quickly and unexpectedly.  When mounted, the rider's head may be up to {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the ground, and the horse may travel at a speed of up to {{convert|65|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| author = J R Silver\n| title = Spinal injuries resulting from horse riding accidents\n| journal = Spinal Cord\n| volume = 40\n| pages = 264\u201371\n| date = June 2002\n| doi= 10.1038/sj.sc.3101280\n| pmid = 12037707\n| issue = 6}}</ref> The injuries observed range from very minor injuries to fatalities.\n\nA study in [[Germany]] reported that the [[relative risk]] of injury from riding a horse, compared to riding a bicycle, was 9 times higher for [[adolescent]]s and 5.6 times higher for younger [[child]]ren, but that riding a horse was less risky than riding a [[moped]].<ref name=\"pmid17426559\">{{cite journal\n|vauthors=Schneiders W, Rollow A, Rammelt S, Grass R, Holch M, Serra A, Richter S, Gruner EM, Schlag B, Roesner D, Zwipp H | title = Risk-inducing activities leading to injuries in a child and adolescent population of Germany\n| journal = [[Journal of Trauma]]\n| volume = 62\n| issue = 4\n| pages = 996\u20131003\n|date=April 2007\n| pmid = 17426559\n| doi = 10.1097/01.ta.0000222584.48001.a0\n| issn =\n}}</ref> In [[Victoria, Australia]], a search of state records found that equestrian sports had the third highest incidence of serious injury, after [[motor sport]]s and [[power boat]]ing.<ref name=\"pmid16046347\">{{cite journal\n|vauthors=Gabbe BJ, Finch CF, Cameron PA, Williamson OD | title = Incidence of serious injury and death during sport and recreation activities in Victoria, Australia\n| journal = [[British Journal of Sports Medicine]]\n| volume = 39\n| issue = 8\n| pages = 573\u201377\n|date=August 2005\n| pmid = 16046347\n| pmc = 1725286\n| doi = 10.1136/bjsm.2004.015750\n| issn =\n}}</ref> In [[Greece]], an analysis of a national registry estimated the incidence of equestrian injury to be 21 per 100,000 person-years for farming and equestrian sports combined, and 160 times higher for [[horse racing]] personnel.

It is inextricably associated with [[gambling]], where in certain events, stakes can become very high. Despite its illegality in most competitions, these conditions of extreme competitiveness can lead to the use of performing-enhancing drugs and extreme training techniques, which can result in negative side effects for the horses' well-being.\nThe races themselves have also proved dangerous to the horses \u2013 especially [[Steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechasing]], which requires the horse to jump hurdles whilst galloping at full speed. This can result in injury or death to the horse, as well as the jockey.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/705194.stm | work=BBC News | title=Should steeplechases be banned? | date=2000-04-17}}</ref> A study by animal welfare group [[Animal Aid]] revealed that approximately 375 racehorses die yearly, with 30% of these either during or as a result of injuries from a race.<ref name=\"animalaid\">{{cite web |url=http://www.animalaid.org.uk/h/n/AA/HOME/ALL/1665// |title=Bred To Death: Background Notes |publisher=Animal Aid |accessdate=2013-07-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510144228/http://www.animalaid.org.uk/h/n/AA/HOME/ALL/1665// |archivedate=2013-05-10 }}</ref> The report also highlighted the increasing frequency of race-related illnesses, including bleeding lungs (exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage) and gastric ulcers.<ref name=\"animalaid\" />\n\nAnimal rights groups are also primarily concerned that certain sports or training exercises may cause unnecessary pain or injuries to horse athletes. Some specific training or showing practices are so widely condemned that they have been made illegal at the national level and violations can incur criminal penalties. The most well-known is ''soring,'' a practice of applying a caustic ointment just above the hooves of a [[Tennessee Walking Horse]] to make it pick up its feet higher. However, in spite of a federal law in the United States prohibiting this practice and routine inspections of horse shows by inspectors from the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], soring is still widespread and difficult to eliminate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health/lameness/soring_030706/|title=EQUUS Special Report: Why Soring Persists|accessdate=31 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909111123/http://www.equisearch.com/article/soring_030706|archivedate=9 September 2014}}</ref> Some events themselves are also considered so abusive that they are banned in many countries.
