However, clear pictorial evidence of the drum emerges only from about 1745, and the drum continued to develop in shape until the early 1800s.<ref name=\"Kippen 2000\">{{cite book|author=James Kippen|title=Hindustani Tala, Garland Encyclopedia of World Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hh03DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT263&dq=kippen+origins+of+tabla&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj4_fXlvorgAhXMneAKHZqZCxoQ6wEIPTAD#v=onepage&q=%20origins%20of%20tabla&f=false|year=1999|publisher=Routledge}}</ref>\n\n===Turk-Arab origins===\nThe first theory, very common during the colonial period scholarship, is based on the etymological links of the word ''tabla'' to Arabic word ''tabl'' which means \"drum\". Beyond the root of the word, this proposal points to the abundant documentary evidence that the Muslim armies, as they invaded the Indian subcontinent, had hundreds of soldiers on camels and horses carrying paired drums. They would beat these drums to scare the residents, the non-Muslim armies, their elephants and chariots, that they intended to attack. [[Babur]], the Turk founder of the [[Mughal Empire]], is known to have used these paired drums carrying battalions in their military campaigns. However, this theory has had the fault that the war drums did not look or sound anything like ''tabla'', they were large paired drums and were called ''naqqara'' (noise, chaos makers).<ref name=\"Gottlieb1993p1\"/>\n\nThe second version of the Arab theory is that Amir Khusraw, a musician patronized by Sultan [[Alauddin Khalji]] invented the ''tabla'' when he cut an ''Awaj drum'', which used to be hourglass shaped. This is, however, unlikely, as no painting or sculpture or document dated to his period supports it with evidence. If ''tabla'' had arrived, or had been invented under Arabic influence from the root word ''tabl'', it would be in the list of musical instruments that were written down by Muslim historians, but such evidence is also absent. For example, Abul Fazi included a long list of musical instruments in his ''Ain-i-akbari'' written in the time of the 16th century Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]], the generous patron of music. Abul Fazi's list makes no mention of ''tabla''.<ref name=\"Gottlieb1993p1\"/>\n\nThe third version of the Arab theory credits the invention of ''tabla'' to the 18th century musician, with a similar sounding name Amir Khusru, where he is suggested to have cut a ''[[Pakhawaj]]'' into two to create ''tabla''. This is not an entirely unreasonable theory, and miniature paintings of this era show instruments that sort of look like ''tabla'', but this would mean that ''tabla'' emerged from within the Muslim community of Indian subcontinent and were not an Arabian import.<ref name=\"Gottlieb1993p1\"/><ref name=\"Lavezzoli2006p37\">{{cite book|author=Peter Lavezzoli|title=The Dawn of Indian Music in the West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OSZKCXtx-wEC&pg=PA37|year=2006|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-0-8264-1815-9|pages=37\u201339}}</ref> However, scholars such as Neil Sorrell and Ram Narayan state that this legend of cutting a ''pakhawaj'' drum into two to make ''tabla'' drums \"cannot be given any credence\".<ref name=\"SorrellNarayan1980p40\"/>\n\n===Indian origins===\n[[File:Five Celestial Musicians LACMA AC1992.254.1-.5.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Five Gandharvas (celestial musicians) from 4th-5th century CE.

Unpublished thesis, UCLA, 1974</ref>\n\n==Construction and features==\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2009}}\nThe smaller drum, played with the dominant hand, is sometimes called dayan (literally \"right\" side ), d\u0101hina, siddha or chatt\u016b, but is correctly called the \"tabla.\" It is made from a conical piece of mostly [[teak]] and [[rosewood]] hollowed out to approximately half of its total depth. The drum is tuned to a specific note, usually either the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]], [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] or [[subdominant]] of the soloist's key and thus complements the [[melody]]. The tuning range is limited although different d\u0101y\u0101\u00f1s are produced in different sizes, each with a different range. Cylindrical wood blocks, known as gatta, are inserted between the strap and the shell allowing tension to be adjusted by their vertical positioning. Fine tuning is achieved while striking vertically on the braided portion of the head using a small, heavy hammer.\n\nThe larger drum, played with the other hand, is called b\u0101y\u0101\u00f1 (literally \"left\") dugg\u012b or dh\u0101m\u0101 (correctly called \"dagga\"), has a much deeper [[bass (sound)|bass]] [[timbre|tone]], much like its distant cousin, the [[kettle drum]]. The b\u0101y\u0101\u00f1 may be made of any of a number of materials.  Brass is the most common, copper is more expensive, but generally held to be the best, while aluminum and steel are often found in inexpensive models. Sometimes wood is used, especially in old b\u0101y\u0101\u00f1s from the Punjab. Clay is also used, although not favored for durability; these are generally found in the North-East region of Bengal.\n\nThe name of the head areas are:\n* chat, chanti, kinar, kinar,\n* sur, maidan, lao, luv, medan\n* center: syahi, siaahi, gab\n\nThe [[drumhead|head]] of each drum has a central area of \"tuning paste\" called the [[syahi]] (lit. \"ink\"; a.k.a. ''sh\u0101\u012b'' or ''g\u0101b''). This is constructed using multiple layers of a paste made from starch (rice or wheat) mixed with a black powder of various origins. The precise construction and shaping of this area is responsible for modification of the drum's natural overtones, resulting in the clarity of pitch (see [[inharmonicity]]) and variety of tonal possibilities unique to this instrument which has a bell-like sound. The skill required for the proper construction of this area is highly refined and is the main differentiating factor in the quality of a particular instrument.\n\nFor stability while playing, each drum is positioned on a [[toroid]]al bundle called ''chutta'' or ''guddi'', consisting of plant fiber or another malleable material wrapped in cloth.\n\n==Musical notation==\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2018}}\nIndian music is traditionally practice-oriented and until the 20th century did not employ written notations as the primary media of instruction, understanding, or transmission. The rules of Indian music and compositions themselves are taught from a guru to a shishya, in person. Thus oral notation, such as the tabla stroke names, is very developed and exact. However, written notation is regarded as a matter of taste and is not standardized. Thus there is no universal system of written notation for the rest of the world to study Indian music.\n\nMaula Bakhsh (born as Chole Khan in 1833) was an Indian musician, singer and poet. His grandson was [[Inayat Khan]], founder of Universal Sufism. He developed the \"first system of notation for Indian music\". He also founded the \"first Academy of Music in India\" in 1886, based in Baroda that encompassed both Eastern and Western musical cultural traditions.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o8Qs7TD4n4sC&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68&dq=indian+classical+notation+system&source=bl&ots=-KHKSwF4jg&sig=EbOof4YvukGosWMnpuCJbojxaxA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sJ3RUZOkI6n20gXDkIHoCw&ved=0CHUQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Two Men and Music : Nationalism in the Making of an Indian Classical ... \u2013 Janaki Bakhle Assistant Professor of History Columbia University \u2013 Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date=2005-09-17 |accessdate=2013-07-01}}</ref>\n\n==Basic strokes==\n[[File:Ustad Zakir Hussain 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zakir Hussain (musician)|Ustad Zakir Hussain]] performing at [[Konark]], [[Odisha]]]]\nSome basic strokes with the dayan on the right side and the bayan on the left side are:\n\n*Ta: (on dayan) striking sharply with the index finger against the rim while simultaneously applying gentle pressure to the edge of the syahi with the ring finger to suppress the fundamental vibration mode\n*Ghe or ga: (on bayan) holding wrist down and arching the fingers over the syahi; the middle and ring-fingers then strike the maidan (resonant)\n*gha (on bayan) striking the index finger\n*Tin: (on dayan) placing the last two fingers of the right hand lightly against the syahi and striking on the border between the syahi and the maidan (resonant)\n*Dha: combination of Na and (Ga or Gha)\n*Dhin: combination of Tin and (Ga or Gha)\n*Ka or kath: (on bayan) striking with the flat palm and fingers (non resonant)\n*Na: (on dayan) striking the edge of the syahi with the last two fingers of the right hand\n*Te: (on dayan) striking the center of the syahi with the middle finger (non resonant)\n*Tu | Tun:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chandrakantha.com/tablasite/bsicbols.htm#Tu|title=Basic Technique of Tabla bols: Dhaa, Dhin, Ga, Ka, Naa, Na, Taa, Tak,TiRaKiTa, Tin, Tu, etc.|first=Todd A.

However, clear pictorial evidence of the drum emerges only from about 1745, and the drum continued to develop in shape until the early 1800s.<ref name=\"Kippen 2000\">{{cite book|author=James Kippen|title=Hindustani Tala, Garland Encyclopedia of World Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hh03DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT263&dq=kippen+origins+of+tabla&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj4_fXlvorgAhXMneAKHZqZCxoQ6wEIPTAD#v=onepage&q=%20origins%20of%20tabla&f=false|year=1999|publisher=Routledge}}</ref>\n\n===Turk-Arab origins===\nThe first theory, very common during the colonial period scholarship, is based on the etymological links of the word ''tabla'' to Arabic word ''tabl'' which means \"drum\". Beyond the root of the word, this proposal points to the abundant documentary evidence that the Muslim armies, as they invaded the Indian subcontinent, had hundreds of soldiers on camels and horses carrying paired drums. They would beat these drums to scare the residents, the non-Muslim armies, their elephants and chariots, that they intended to attack. [[Babur]], the Turk founder of the [[Mughal Empire]], is known to have used these paired drums carrying battalions in their military campaigns. However, this theory has had the fault that the war drums did not look or sound anything like ''tabla'', they were large paired drums and were called ''naqqara'' (noise, chaos makers).<ref name=\"Gottlieb1993p1\"/>\n\nThe second version of the Arab theory is that Amir Khusraw, a musician patronized by Sultan [[Alauddin Khalji]] invented the ''tabla'' when he cut an ''Awaj drum'', which used to be hourglass shaped. This is, however, unlikely, as no painting or sculpture or document dated to his period supports it with evidence. If ''tabla'' had arrived, or had been invented under Arabic influence from the root word ''tabl'', it would be in the list of musical instruments that were written down by Muslim historians, but such evidence is also absent. For example, Abul Fazi included a long list of musical instruments in his ''Ain-i-akbari'' written in the time of the 16th century Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]], the generous patron of music. Abul Fazi's list makes no mention of ''tabla''.<ref name=\"Gottlieb1993p1\"/>\n\nThe third version of the Arab theory credits the invention of ''tabla'' to the 18th century musician, with a similar sounding name Amir Khusru, where he is suggested to have cut a ''[[Pakhawaj]]'' into two to create ''tabla''. This is not an entirely unreasonable theory, and miniature paintings of this era show instruments that sort of look like ''tabla'', but this would mean that ''tabla'' emerged from within the Muslim community of Indian subcontinent and were not an Arabian import.<ref name=\"Gottlieb1993p1\"/><ref name=\"Lavezzoli2006p37\">{{cite book|author=Peter Lavezzoli|title=The Dawn of Indian Music in the West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OSZKCXtx-wEC&pg=PA37|year=2006|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-0-8264-1815-9|pages=37\u201339}}</ref> However, scholars such as Neil Sorrell and Ram Narayan state that this legend of cutting a ''pakhawaj'' drum into two to make ''tabla'' drums \"cannot be given any credence\".<ref name=\"SorrellNarayan1980p40\"/>\n\n===Indian origins===\n[[File:Five Celestial Musicians LACMA AC1992.254.1-.5.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Five Gandharvas (celestial musicians) from 4th-5th century CE.

Unpublished thesis, UCLA, 1974</ref>\n\n==Construction and features==\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2009}}\nThe smaller drum, played with the dominant hand, is sometimes called dayan (literally \"right\" side ), d\u0101hina, siddha or chatt\u016b, but is correctly called the \"tabla.\" It is made from a conical piece of mostly [[teak]] and [[rosewood]] hollowed out to approximately half of its total depth. The drum is tuned to a specific note, usually either the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]], [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] or [[subdominant]] of the soloist's key and thus complements the [[melody]]. The tuning range is limited although different d\u0101y\u0101\u00f1s are produced in different sizes, each with a different range. Cylindrical wood blocks, known as gatta, are inserted between the strap and the shell allowing tension to be adjusted by their vertical positioning. Fine tuning is achieved while striking vertically on the braided portion of the head using a small, heavy hammer.\n\nThe larger drum, played with the other hand, is called b\u0101y\u0101\u00f1 (literally \"left\") dugg\u012b or dh\u0101m\u0101 (correctly called \"dagga\"), has a much deeper [[bass (sound)|bass]] [[timbre|tone]], much like its distant cousin, the [[kettle drum]]. The b\u0101y\u0101\u00f1 may be made of any of a number of materials.  Brass is the most common, copper is more expensive, but generally held to be the best, while aluminum and steel are often found in inexpensive models. Sometimes wood is used, especially in old b\u0101y\u0101\u00f1s from the Punjab. Clay is also used, although not favored for durability; these are generally found in the North-East region of Bengal.\n\nThe name of the head areas are:\n* chat, chanti, kinar, kinar,\n* sur, maidan, lao, luv, medan\n* center: syahi, siaahi, gab\n\nThe [[drumhead|head]] of each drum has a central area of \"tuning paste\" called the [[syahi]] (lit. \"ink\"; a.k.a. ''sh\u0101\u012b'' or ''g\u0101b''). This is constructed using multiple layers of a paste made from starch (rice or wheat) mixed with a black powder of various origins. The precise construction and shaping of this area is responsible for modification of the drum's natural overtones, resulting in the clarity of pitch (see [[inharmonicity]]) and variety of tonal possibilities unique to this instrument which has a bell-like sound. The skill required for the proper construction of this area is highly refined and is the main differentiating factor in the quality of a particular instrument.\n\nFor stability while playing, each drum is positioned on a [[toroid]]al bundle called ''chutta'' or ''guddi'', consisting of plant fiber or another malleable material wrapped in cloth.\n\n==Musical notation==\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2018}}\nIndian music is traditionally practice-oriented and until the 20th century did not employ written notations as the primary media of instruction, understanding, or transmission. The rules of Indian music and compositions themselves are taught from a guru to a shishya, in person. Thus oral notation, such as the tabla stroke names, is very developed and exact. However, written notation is regarded as a matter of taste and is not standardized. Thus there is no universal system of written notation for the rest of the world to study Indian music.\n\nMaula Bakhsh (born as Chole Khan in 1833) was an Indian musician, singer and poet. His grandson was [[Inayat Khan]], founder of Universal Sufism. He developed the \"first system of notation for Indian music\". He also founded the \"first Academy of Music in India\" in 1886, based in Baroda that encompassed both Eastern and Western musical cultural traditions.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o8Qs7TD4n4sC&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68&dq=indian+classical+notation+system&source=bl&ots=-KHKSwF4jg&sig=EbOof4YvukGosWMnpuCJbojxaxA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sJ3RUZOkI6n20gXDkIHoCw&ved=0CHUQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Two Men and Music : Nationalism in the Making of an Indian Classical ... \u2013 Janaki Bakhle Assistant Professor of History Columbia University \u2013 Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date=2005-09-17 |accessdate=2013-07-01}}</ref>\n\n==Basic strokes==\n[[File:Ustad Zakir Hussain 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zakir Hussain (musician)|Ustad Zakir Hussain]] performing at [[Konark]], [[Odisha]]]]\nSome basic strokes with the dayan on the right side and the bayan on the left side are:\n\n*Ta: (on dayan) striking sharply with the index finger against the rim while simultaneously applying gentle pressure to the edge of the syahi with the ring finger to suppress the fundamental vibration mode\n*Ghe or ga: (on bayan) holding wrist down and arching the fingers over the syahi; the middle and ring-fingers then strike the maidan (resonant)\n*gha (on bayan) striking the index finger\n*Tin: (on dayan) placing the last two fingers of the right hand lightly against the syahi and striking on the border between the syahi and the maidan (resonant)\n*Dha: combination of Na and (Ga or Gha)\n*Dhin: combination of Tin and (Ga or Gha)\n*Ka or kath: (on bayan) striking with the flat palm and fingers (non resonant)\n*Na: (on dayan) striking the edge of the syahi with the last two fingers of the right hand\n*Te: (on dayan) striking the center of the syahi with the middle finger (non resonant)\n*Tu | Tun:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chandrakantha.com/tablasite/bsicbols.htm#Tu|title=Basic Technique of Tabla bols: Dhaa, Dhin, Ga, Ka, Naa, Na, Taa, Tak,TiRaKiTa, Tin, Tu, etc.|first=Todd A.

The show aired at 4:30pm IST Sunday.\n\n== Background ==\nVikram Aur Betaal' is based on 'Betaal Pachisi', written in the 11th century by Kashmiri poet Somdev Bhatt. These are spellbinding stories told to the wise King Vikramaditya by the witty ghost Betaal. Vikramaditya was a great king who ruled over a prosperous kingdom from his capital at Ujjain. He had immense love for learning as well as for adventure. He was brave, fearless and with a strong will. Everyday many visitors used to visit the king and gift him something. The King used to accept all the gifts with the same courtesy. Among such visitors was a mendicant who presented the king with a fruit on every visit. King Vikramaditya used to hand over the fruit to the royal storekeeper. One day while handling the fruit, it broke and from the pop came out a handy ball of ruby. The King was surprised. He ordered to check all the fruits, and from all fruits came out a fine ruby. The King decided to meet the mendicant. However, the mendicant had set a condition that the King must meet him under a Banyan tree in the center of the cremation ground beyond the city, at night, on the 14th day of the dark half of the month. King met him as decided. The King asked the mendicant why he was doing this. The mendicant tells that there is a task that only a King like Vikrmaditya can perform. King Vikramaditya had to visit the northern-most corner of this ground where he would find a very ancient tree. There would be a corpse hanging from one of its branches. He would have to fetch it for the mendicant, as the mendicant was seeking certain occult powers which he would get only if a king brought this particular corpse to him and if he would practice certain rites sitting on it. According to the legend the King Vikramaditya, in order to fulfil a vow, was required to remove a corpse of Betaal from a treetop and carry it on his shoulder to another place in silence. En route, the spirit of Betaal (in the corpse) used to narrate a story to the king and after completing the story Betaal would pose a query that if he (The king) knew the answer, was bound to respond lest he will break his head into thousand pieces. But if he does speak out, he would break the vow of silence and Betaal would fly back to the treetop, leaving the king inches short of his destination! The king would go after the vampire and start all over again. And so on and on. As the name 'Betaal Pachisi' suggests the Betaal told King 25 stories. ('Pachisi' (Hindi) is derived from word 'Pachis' in Hindi which means twenty five) . However, looking at the determination of the king Vikramaditya, Betaal finally disclosed the true motive of the mendicant. The mendicant's plan was to practice certain rites sitting on Betaal but he would kill the King also to get all powers of world and rule the world. This created suspicion in Vikramaditya's mind. However, he still went to the mendicant, but he was prepared for surprise. Betaal proved to be right and the mendicant tried to kill Vikramaditya. However, Vikramaditya outwitted the mendicant and killed him.\n\n== The stories ==\nThe name Betaal Pachisi suggests the Betaal told the king 25 stories (pacchisi - \u092a\u091a\u094d\u091a\u0940\u0938\u0940 is derived from pacchis - \u092a\u091a\u094d\u091a\u0940\u0938 in [[Hindi]], which means 25), each narrated while Vikramaditya is carrying Betaal to the mendicant, where of each ended with a moral.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Arun Govil]] - as King Vikramaditya.\n* [[Sajjan (actor)|Sajjan]] - as Betaal.\n* [[Arvind Trivedi]] - as the mendicant.\n* [[Deepika Chikhalia]] - in many roles.\n* [[Vijay Arora]] - in many roles.\n* [[Ramesh Bhatkar]] - in many roles.\n* [[Mulraj Rajda]] - in many roles.\n* Rajni Bala - in many roles.\n* [[Sunil Lahiri]] - in many roles.\n* [[Lilliput (actor)|Lilliput]] - in many roles.\n* [[Rama Vij]] - in many roles.\n* [[Satish Kaul]] - in many roles.\n* [[Surjeet Mohanty]] - in many roles.\n\n==List of episodes==\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" \n|-\n! style=\"width: 03%; background: #4169E1;\" | # \n! style=\"width: 50%; background: #4169E1;\" | Title \n! style=\"width: 47%; background: #4169E1;\" | Other Cast\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 1 || '''\"King Vikramaditya and the Yogi / Suryamal and His Bride's Dilemma\"''' || Balwant Bansal as Mantri<br />[[Ramesh Bhatkar]] as the bride's father<br />Gagan Gupta as soldier<br />[[Satish Kaul]] as Suryamal  \n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#E6E6FA\" colspan=3 |'''Short Summary:''' The first episode shows the story of how Raja Vikramaditya and Betaal meet.

The series contained stories from [[Hindu mythology|Indian mythology]]. The concept of the program was based on ''[[Baital Pachisi]]'', a collection of tales about the legendary king Vikram (identified as [[Vikram\u0101ditya]]) and the [[Vetala]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32198806-vikram-and-betaal |title=Vikram And Betaal |website=www.goodreads.com |publisher=[[Amazon]] [[Goodreads]] |access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> a spirit analogous to a [[vampire]] in western literature. The show aired at 4:30pm IST Sunday.\n\n== Background ==\nVikram Aur Betaal' is based on 'Betaal Pachisi', written in the 11th century by Kashmiri poet Somdev Bhatt. These are spellbinding stories told to the wise King Vikramaditya by the witty ghost Betaal. Vikramaditya was a great king who ruled over a prosperous kingdom from his capital at Ujjain. He had immense love for learning as well as for adventure. He was brave, fearless and with a strong will. Everyday many visitors used to visit the king and gift him something. The King used to accept all the gifts with the same courtesy. Among such visitors was a mendicant who presented the king with a fruit on every visit. King Vikramaditya used to hand over the fruit to the royal storekeeper. One day while handling the fruit, it broke and from the pop came out a handy ball of ruby. The King was surprised. He ordered to check all the fruits, and from all fruits came out a fine ruby. The King decided to meet the mendicant. However, the mendicant had set a condition that the King must meet him under a Banyan tree in the center of the cremation ground beyond the city, at night, on the 14th day of the dark half of the month. King met him as decided. The King asked the mendicant why he was doing this. The mendicant tells that there is a task that only a King like Vikrmaditya can perform. King Vikramaditya had to visit the northern-most corner of this ground where he would find a very ancient tree. There would be a corpse hanging from one of its branches. He would have to fetch it for the mendicant, as the mendicant was seeking certain occult powers which he would get only if a king brought this particular corpse to him and if he would practice certain rites sitting on it. According to the legend the King Vikramaditya, in order to fulfil a vow, was required to remove a corpse of Betaal from a treetop and carry it on his shoulder to another place in silence. En route, the spirit of Betaal (in the corpse) used to narrate a story to the king and after completing the story Betaal would pose a query that if he (The king) knew the answer, was bound to respond lest he will break his head into thousand pieces. But if he does speak out, he would break the vow of silence and Betaal would fly back to the treetop, leaving the king inches short of his destination! The king would go after the vampire and start all over again. And so on and on. As the name 'Betaal Pachisi' suggests the Betaal told King 25 stories. ('Pachisi' (Hindi) is derived from word 'Pachis' in Hindi which means twenty five) . However, looking at the determination of the king Vikramaditya, Betaal finally disclosed the true motive of the mendicant. The mendicant's plan was to practice certain rites sitting on Betaal but he would kill the King also to get all powers of world and rule the world. This created suspicion in Vikramaditya's mind. However, he still went to the mendicant, but he was prepared for surprise. Betaal proved to be right and the mendicant tried to kill Vikramaditya. However, Vikramaditya outwitted the mendicant and killed him.\n\n== The stories ==\nThe name Betaal Pachisi suggests the Betaal told the king 25 stories (pacchisi - \u092a\u091a\u094d\u091a\u0940\u0938\u0940 is derived from pacchis - \u092a\u091a\u094d\u091a\u0940\u0938 in [[Hindi]], which means 25), each narrated while Vikramaditya is carrying Betaal to the mendicant, where of each ended with a moral.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Arun Govil]] - as King Vikramaditya.\n* [[Sajjan (actor)|Sajjan]] - as Betaal.\n* [[Arvind Trivedi]] - as the mendicant.\n* [[Deepika Chikhalia]] - in many roles.\n* [[Vijay Arora]] - in many roles.\n* [[Ramesh Bhatkar]] - in many roles.\n* [[Mulraj Rajda]] - in many roles.\n* Rajni Bala - in many roles.\n* [[Sunil Lahiri]] - in many roles.\n* [[Lilliput (actor)|Lilliput]] - in many roles.\n* [[Rama Vij]] - in many roles.\n* [[Satish Kaul]] - in many roles.\n* [[Surjeet Mohanty]] - in many roles.\n\n==List of episodes==\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" \n|-\n! style=\"width: 03%; background: #4169E1;\" | # \n! style=\"width: 50%; background: #4169E1;\" | Title \n! style=\"width: 47%; background: #4169E1;\" | Other Cast\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | 1 || '''\"King Vikramaditya and the Yogi / Suryamal and His Bride's Dilemma\"''' || Balwant Bansal as Mantri<br />[[Ramesh Bhatkar]] as the bride's father<br />Gagan Gupta as soldier<br />[[Satish Kaul]] as Suryamal  \n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#E6E6FA\" colspan=3 |'''Short Summary:''' The first episode shows the story of how Raja Vikramaditya and Betaal meet.

{"title_page": "Psychology of self", "text_new": "{{short description|The study of either the cognitive, conative or affective representation of one's identity, or the subject of experience}}\n{{distinguish|Self psychology}}\nThe '''psychology of self''' is the study of either the [[cognitive]], [[Conative function|conative]] or [[affective]] representation of one's identity, or the subject of experience. The earliest formulation of the self in modern psychology derived from the distinction between the self as ''I,'' the subjective knower, and the self as ''Me'', the object that is known.<ref>James, W. (1891).  ''The Principles of Psychology, Vol.1.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. (Original work published 1891)</ref>\n\nCurrent views of the self in psychology position the self as playing an integral part in human motivation, cognition, affect, and [[social identity]].<ref>Sedikides, C. & Spencer, S. J. (Eds.) (2007). ''The Self''. New York: Psychology Press</ref> It may be the case that we can now usefully attempt to ground experience of self in a neural process with cognitive consequences, which will give us insight into the elements of which the complex multiply situated selves of modern identity are composed.\n\nThe self has many facets that help make up integral parts of it, such as [[self-awareness]], [[self-esteem]], [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]], and [[self-perception]]. All parts of the self enable people to alter, change, add, and modify aspects of themselves in order to gain social acceptance in society.\n\nA useful accounting of contributing factors to what we call \"selfhood\" is the self gradually emerges and arises at the intersection between:\n*the habits in our biological-metabolic processes,\n*the socio-cultural habits of local culture inculcated into us,\n*our role models, good and bad,\n*how much responsibility the individual takes to make healthy choices gain and again, develop and strengthen their own Chooser self.\n\n==Kohut's formulation==\n{{Main|Heinz Kohut}}\nHeinz Kohut<ref>H. Kohut (1966), \"Forms and Transformations of Narcissism\" in C. Strozier (Ed.), ''Self Psychology and the Humanities'', New York: Norton, 1985 pp. 97\u2013123</ref> initially proposed a bipolar self compromising two systems of [[narcissistic]] perfection:'' 1) a system of ambitions and, 2) a system of ideals.''  Kohut called the pole of ambitions the ''narcissistic self'' (later, the ''grandiose self''<ref>H. Kohut (1971), ''The Analysis of the Self.'' New York: International Universities Press</ref>), while the pole of ideals was designated the ''idealized parental [[imago]]''. According to Kohut, these poles of the self represented natural progressions in the psychic life of infants and toddlers.\n\nKohut argued that when the child's ambitions and exhibitionistic strivings were chronically frustrated, arrests in the grandiose self led to the preservation of a false, expansive sense of self that could manifest outwardly in the visible [[grandiosity]] of the frank narcissist, or remain hidden from view, unless discovered in a narcissistic therapeutic [[transference]] (or ''selfobject transference'') that would expose these primitive grandiose fantasies and strivings.  Kohut termed this form of transference a ''mirror transference''.  In this transference, the strivings of the grandiose self are mobilized and the patient attempts to use the therapist to gratify these strivings.\n\nKohut proposed that arrests in the pole of ideals occurred when the child suffered chronic and excessive disappointment over the failings of early idealized figures.  Deficits in the pole of ideals were associated with the development of an idealizing transference to the therapist who becomes associated with the patient's primitive fantasies of omnipotent parental perfection.\n\nKohut believed that [[narcissistic injuries]] were inevitable and, in any case, necessary to temper ambitions and ideals with realism through the experience of more manageable frustrations and disappointments.  It was the chronicity and lack of recovery from these injuries (arising from a number of possible causes) that he regarded as central to the preservation of primitive self systems untempered by realism.\n\nAccording to the 1984 book, ''How Does Analysis Cure'',<ref>A. Goldberg and P. Stepansky (Eds.), ''How Does Analysis Cure'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press</ref> Kohut's observation of patients led him to propose two additional forms of transference associated with self deficits: ''1) the twinship and, 2) the merger transference''.  In his later years, Kohut believed that selfobject needs were both present and quite varied in normal individuals, as well as in narcissistic individuals.  To be clear, selfobjects are not external persons.  Kohut and Wolf, 1978<ref>\"Disorders of the Self and Their Treatment\", ''[[International Journal of Psychoanalysis]]'', 59: 413-425</ref> explain:\n\n''\"Self objects are objects which we experience as part of our self; the expected control over them is, therefore, closer to the concept of control which a grownup expects to have over his own body and mind than to the concept of control which he expects to have over others. (p.413)\"''\n\nKohut's notion of the self can be difficult to grasp because it is experience-distant, although it is posited based upon experience-near observation of the therapeutic transference.  Kohut relied heavily on empathy as a method of observation.  Specifically, the clinician's observations of his or her own feelings in the transference help the clinician see things from the subjective view of the patient\u2014to experience the world in ways that are closer to the way the patient experiences it. (note: Kohut did not regard empathy as curative. Empathy is a method of observation).\n\n==Winnicott's selves==\n{{Main|Donald Winnicott|True self and false self}}\nDonald Winnicott distinguished what he called the \"true self\" from the \"false self\" in the human personality, considering the true self as one based on the individual's sense of being, not doing, something which was rooted in the experiencing body.<ref>Josephine Klein, ''Our Need for Others and its Roots in Infancy'' (London 1994) p. 230</ref> As he memorably put it to [[Harry Guntrip]], 'You know about \"being active\", but not about \"just growing, just breathing\"':<ref>Quoted in Michael Parsons, ''The Dove that Return, the Dove that Vanishes'' (London 2000) p. 82</ref> it was the latter qualities that went to form the true self.\n\nNevertheless, Winnicott did not undervalue the role of the false self in the human personality, regarding it in fact as a necessary form of defensive organization \u2013 a kind of caretaker, a survival suit behind the protection of which the true self was able to continue to exist.<ref>Josephine Klein, ''Our Need for Others and its Roots in Infancy'' (London 1994) p.  318</ref>\nFive levels of false self organization were identified by Winnicott, running along a kind of continuum.<ref name=\"Jacki Watts 2009 p. 148\">Jacki Watts et al, ''Developmental Psychology'' (2009) p. 148</ref> \n# In the most severe instance,  the false self completely replaces and ousts the true self, leaving the latter a mere possibility.<ref>Jacki Watts et al, ''Developmental Psychology'' (2009) p. 149</ref>  \n# Less severely, the false self protects the true self, which remains unactualised - for Winnicott a clear example of a clinical condition organised for the positive goal of preserving the individual in spite of abnormal environmental conditions of the environment.\n# Closer to health, the false self supports the individual's search for conditions that will allow the true self to recover its well-being - its own identity.\n# Even closer to health, we find the false self \"... established on the basis of identifications\".<ref>D. W. Winnicott, ''The Maturational Processes and the Facilitating Environment'' (New York 1965) p. 121</ref>\n# Finally, in a healthy person, the false self is composed of that which facilitates social behavior, the manners and courtesy that allows for a smooth social life, with emotions expressed in socially acceptable forms.<ref name=\"Jacki Watts 2009 p. 148\"/>\n\nAs for the true self, Winnicott linked it both to playing, and to a kind of  \"hide and seek\"' designed to protect creative ownership of one's real self against exploitation,<ref>Rosalind Minsky, ''Psychoanalysis and Gender'' (1996) p. 121</ref> without entirely forfeiting the ability to relate to others.<ref>D. W. Winnicott, ''The Maturational Processes and the Facilitating Environment'' (New York 1965) p. 187</ref>\n\n==Berne's transactional analysis==\n<!--This section is linked from [[Inner critic]] ([[MOS:HEAD]])-->\n{{Main|Eric Berne|Transactional analysis}}\nIn his transactional analysis theory Eric Berne distinguished the personality's [[Transactional Analysis#The Ego-State (or Parent-Adult-Child, PAC) model|ego states]] - Parent, Adult and Child - from what he called 'the real Self, the one that can move from one ego state to another'.<ref>Eric Berne, ''What Do You Say After You Say Hello? (1974) p. 276</ref>\n* The parent ego consists of borrowed behaviors and feelings from previous caregivers. The parent ego can consist of either the Nurturing or Critical Parent.  The Nurturing Parent contains a more loving nature, whereas the Critical (or Prejudiced) Parent consists of preconceived ideas, thoughts, and behaviors learned from previous parents or caregivers. Some of this information can be beneficial, while others are not.\n* The adult ego is otherwise known as our data-processing center. This ego state is able to judge information based on facts, rather than emotions or preconceived beliefs.\n* The child ego is identified as the state that holds all of our memories, emotions, and feelings. People carry this ego state with them all of the time and can reflect back on it at any time. This state can also be divided into two segments: the Free (or Natural) child and the Adapted (and/or Rebellious) child. The Free child represents spontaneity, creativity, and a direct way of perceiving the world. Intimate relationships are able to form due to a person's contact with their own inner child. The less people are in touch with their inner child, the less they are able to form intimate relationships with other people. The Adapted child is the state in which people are able to comply and respond with parental commands and messages. If a parental command is viewed as too strong and demanding, a child ego can rebel against it, which is why this state can also become the Rebellious Child.<ref name=\"Transactional Analysis Theory: the Basics\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.carolsolomonphd.com/web_pdfs/Transact.pdf|title=Solomon, Carol, Ph.D. \"Transactional Analysis Theory: the Basics.\" Transactional Analysis Journal 33.1 (2003): 15-22.}}</ref>\nBerne considered that 'the feeling of \"Self\" is a mobile one. It can reside in any of the three ego states at any given moment, and can jump from one to the other as occasion arises'.<ref>Berne, p. 248-9</ref>\n\nA person's tone, gestures, choice of words, posture, and emotional state can portray which ego state they are currently in. By knowing about their own ego states, a person can use each one in particular situations in order to enhance their experience or make new social connections. For example, a person would most likely want to be in a Free Child state along with the Adult state while attending a party in order to maximize the fun they are having while also being able to make wise choices.<ref name=\"Transactional Analysis Theory: the Basics\"/>\n\nTransactions is another concept in the transactional theory that relates to how people of a certain ego state interact with people of the same or different ego state at a particular moment. Straight transactions are complementary and result in clear communication among other people. On the contrary, crossed transactions are of diverging ego states that make communication either hard or frustrating. These provoke emotional stress and negative feedback.<ref name=\"Transactional Analysis Theory: the Basics\"/> Nevertheless, Berne saw the Self as the most valuable part of the personality: 'when people get to know each other well, they penetrate into the depths where this real Self resides, and that is the part of the other person they respect and love'<ref>Berne, p. 276</ref>\n\n== Jungian archetype of the self ==\n{{Main|Self (Jung)}}\nIn classical Jungian analysis, the Self is the central archetype of several [[Jungian archetypes|archetype]]s, which are apriori or predispositions of responding to the world in particular ways.<ref name=\"Transpersonal Pioneers\">Fadiman, J.

The Self, according to Jung, is the most important and difficult archetype to understand.<ref name=\"Transpersonal Pioneers\"/> It is realized as the product of individuation, which is defined as the process of integrating one's personality.<ref name=\"Man and his Symbols\"/> The self can appear to the individual both impersonally as dreams and images (circle, mandala, crystal, or stone) or personally (royal couple, divine child, or another divine symbol). Symbolic spiritual people, such as Christ and Mohammed, are also seen as symbols of the self, because they represent unity and equilibrium.<ref name=\"Transpersonal Pioneers\"/> The [[Wise Old Woman/Man]] can also serve as 'a symbolic personification of the Self'.<ref name=\"Man and his Symbols\">Marie-Louise von Franz, in C. G. Jung ed., ''Man and his Symbols'' (London 1978) p. 208</ref>\n\nWhat distinguishes classical Jungian psychology from earlier theories is the idea that there are two centers of the personality. The ego is the center of conscious identity, whereas the Self is the center of the total personality\u2014including consciousness, the unconscious, and the ego. The Self is both the whole and the center. While the ego is a self-contained little circle off the center contained within the whole, the Self can be understood as the greater circle.<ref name=\"Man and his Symbols\"/> People know of this Self, yet it is not known. Jung expresses it in this way: \"If the Self could be wholly experienced, it would be a limited experience, whereas in reality its experience is unlimited and endless.... If I were one with the Self I would have knowledge of everything, I would speak Sanskrit, read cuneiform script, know the events that took place in pre-history be acquainted with the life of other planets, etc.\"<ref name=\"Transpersonal Pioneers\"/>\n\nThe Self, besides being the centre of the psyche, is also autonomous, meaning that it exists outside of time and space. Jung also called the Self an ''[[imago dei]]''. The Self is the source of dreams and often appears as an authority figure in dreams with the ability to perceive the future or guide one in the present.<ref name=\"Thompson\">{{cite book | title=Waking, Dreaming, Being.

[[Edward E. Sampson]] (1989) argues that the preoccupation with independence is harmful in that it creates racial, sexual and national divides and does not allow for observation of the self-in-[[Other (philosophy)|other]] and other-in-self.\n\nThe very notion of selfhood has been attacked on the grounds that it is seen as necessary for the mechanisms of advanced capitalism to function. In ''Inventing our selves: Psychology, power, and personhood'', [[Nikolas Rose]] (1998) proposes that psychology is now employed as a technology that allows humans to buy into an invented and arguably false sense of self. In this way, '[[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s theories of self have been extensively developed by Rose to explore techniques of governance via self-formation...the self has to become an enterprising subject, acquiring [[cultural capital]] in order to gain employment',<ref>Lisa Adkins, ''Feminism after Bourdieu'' (2004) p. 78</ref> thus contributing to self-[[wikt:exploit|exploitation]].\n\n<!-- Commenting this out for now; needs to be written/explained more clearly: The quantifying and classifying process is referred to by [[Michel Foucault]] (1975, 1977) as being the issue of [[\u2018the calculable man']]: when the masses are classified they can be exploited as individuals and it is individuality that allows this to occur. -->\nIt is suggested by Kohut that for an individual to talk about, explain, understand or judge oneself is linguistically impossible, since it requires the self to understand its ''self''. This is seen as philosophically invalid, being self-referential, or [[Reification (fallacy)|reification]], also known as a [[circular argument]]. Thus, if actions arise so that the self attempts self-explanation, confusion may well occur within linguistic mental pathways and processes.\n\nAs for the theorists of the self, Winnicott has his critics, suggesting that his theory of the way 'the False Self is invented to manage a prematurely important object...enacts a kind of dissociated regard or recognition of the object'<ref>Adam Phillips, ''On Kissing, Tickling and Being Bored'' (1994) p. 31</ref> is itself rooted in 'his own childhood experience of trying to \"make my living\" by keeping his mother alive'.<ref>Minsky, p. 134</ref>\n\nThe self has long been considered as the central element and support of any experience.<ref name=Self>Tapu, CS (2001). ''[http://relationtherapy.webs.com/Hypostatic_Personality/Hypostatic_Personality.htm Hypostatic Personality: Psychopathology of Doing and Being Made]''. Premier, p. 114. {{ISBN|973-8030-59-5}}.</ref> The self is not 'permanently stuck into the heart of [[consciousness]]'.\n\"I am not always as intensively aware of me as an agent, as I am of my actions. That results from the fact that I perform only part of my actions, the other part being conducted by my thought, expression, practical operations, and so on.\"<ref name=Self />\n\n==Memory and the self==\n\nMemory and the self are interconnected with each other that, combined, can be defined as the Self-Memory System (SMS). The self is viewed as a combination of memories and self-images (working self). Conway proposes that a person's long-term memory and working self are dependent on each other. Our prior knowledge of our self puts constraints on what our working self is and the working self modifies the access to our long-term memory, as well as, what it consists of.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Conway | first1 = Martin A | year = 2005 | title = Memory and the Self | url = http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/k.allan/pages/dept/webfiles/4thyear/conway%202005%20jml.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Memory and Language | volume = 53 | issue = | pages = 594\u2013628 }}</ref>\n\nOne view of the Self, following from [[John Locke]], sees it as a product of [[episodic memory]].<ref name=\"Conway\">{{cite journal | last1 = Conway | first1 = MA | last2 = Pleydell-Pearce | first2 = CW | year = 2000 | title = The construction of autobiographical memories in the self-memory system | url = | journal = Psychol Rev. | volume = 107 | issue = 2| pages = 261\u201388 | pmid = 10789197 }}</ref> It has been suggested that transitory mental constructions within episodic memory form a self-memory system that grounds the goals of the working self,<ref name=\"Conway\"/> but research upon those with [[amnesia]] find they have a coherent sense of self based upon preserved conceptual autobiographical knowledge,<ref name=\"Rathbone\">{{cite journal | last1 = Rathbone | first1 = CJ | last2 = Moulin | first2 = CJ | last3 = Conway | first3 = MA | year = 2009 | title = Autobiographical memory and amnesia: Using conceptual knowledge to ground the self | url = | journal = Neurocase | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 1\u201314 | pmid = 19382038 | doi = 10.1080/13554790902849164 }}</ref> and [[semantic memory|semantic fact]]s, and so conceptual knowledge rather than episodic memory.<ref name=\"Rathbone\"/>\n\nBoth episodic and semantic memory systems have been proposed to generate a sense of self-identity: personal episodic memory enables the phenomenological continuity of identity, while personal semantic memory generates the narrative continuity of identity.<ref name=\"Addis\">Addis DR, Tippett L J.

One example of this is a study by Conway and Ross,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Conway|first=Michael|last2=Ross|first2=Michael|title=Getting what you want by revising what you had.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=47|issue=4|pages=738\u2013748|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.47.4.738|year=1984}}</ref> which demonstrates that if a change in skill is expected, but there is no actual improvement, people will believe that their past skill state was worse than it was.\n\n=== Recalling Pain ===\nIn general recollection of pain is fairly accurate, although differences are seen between recollection of acute and chronic pain. Research suggests that recall for acute pain is more accurate than recall for chronic pain.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hunter|first=Myra|last2=Philips|first2=Clare|last3=Rachman|first3=Stanley|title=Memory for pain|journal=Pain|volume=6|issue=1|pages=35\u201346|doi=10.1016/0304-3959(79)90138-6|pmid=424233|year=1979}}</ref>\n\nAn interesting phenomenon seen in recollection of pain in the self is the peak-end phenomenon. Research has shown that when enduring painful experiences, people will 'prefer' more drawn out experiences that end with lower levels of pain, over shorter experiences that end with higher levels of pain, even though the shorter experiences provide less pain overall.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Redelmeier|first=Donald A|last2=Katz|first2=Joel|last3=Kahneman|first3=Daniel|title=Memories of colonoscopy: a randomized trial|journal=Pain|volume=104|issue=1|pages=187\u2013194|doi=10.1016/s0304-3959(03)00003-4|year=2003|hdl=10315/7959}}</ref>\n\nRecalled ratings of pain are more closely related to a combination of the peak pain in the experience, and the end pain of the experience.

The self is made up of three main parts that, incorporated, allow for the self to maintain its function. The parts of the self include: [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|Self-knowledge]], interpersonal self, and the agent self.<ref name=\"The Self\">Baumeister, Roy F., and Brad J. Bushman. \"The Self.\" Social Psychology and Human Nature. 2nd ed. Belmont, CA: Cengage Learning, 2011. 57\u201396. Print.</ref>\n\n===Self-knowledge===\n{{Main|Self-knowledge (psychology)}}\nSelf-knowledge is sometimes referred to as self-concept. This feature allows for people to gather information and beliefs about themselves. A person's self-awareness, self-esteem, and self-deception all fall under the self-knowledge part of self.  We learn about ourselves through our looking-glass selves, introspection, social comparisons, and self-perception.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\nThe '''[[looking glass self]]''' is a term to describe a theory that people learn about themselves through other people. In the looking-glass self proposal, a person visualizes how they appear to others, the person imagines how other people will judge them, and they then develop a response to the judgment they receive from other people. The response will likely be something viewed as pride or shame about themselves. The looking-glass self has proved to be partially accurate and inaccurate. A person's self-concept does not solely depend on how others view them. A person can view themselves as friendly; however they may appear to be quiet and uptight to another person that may not know them very well.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n'''[[Introspection]]''' refers to the manner in which a person gathers information about oneself through mental functions and emotions. Although a person might not know why they are thinking or feeling in such a way, they are able to know what it is they are feeling. However, developmental stages in life might affect introspection. In a Rosenburg study, children up to a certain stage in development showed that they knew that their parents actually knew them better than they knew themselves. Also, studies done by [[Richard E. Nisbett|Nisbett]] and [[Timothy Wilson|Wilson]] uncovered the fact that people might not actually know what they are thinking all of the time. In one particular study, they discovered that many people bought the first stockings that they saw and gave the reasoning behind their choice for buying being based on the color or softness. So, in conclusion, introspection is a way of gaining knowledge about yourself through your inner emotions and thinking, however it is a conscious part of the brain. The automatic part of the brain can make us do a lot of unconscious acts that people have no reasoning for.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n'''Social comparison''' is regarded as the way in which we compare ourselves to other people around us. By looking to other people, we can rate our work and behaviors as good, neutral, or bad. The most beneficial or useful comparisons are those of people that are in the same category as ourselves. For example, a high school football player would be more appropriate in comparing himself to an all-star high school football player, rather than a Super Bowl-winning football player with over 10 years of experience. An upward social comparison refers to a person comparing themself to a person that is perceived as better than them in a particular area. This can be either motivational or discouraging to the person comparing themself. A downward social comparison refers to a person comparing themself to a person that is perceived as worse than them, which can make that person feel better about their self.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\nThe '''[[self-perception theory]]''' is another theory in which a person infers about themselves through their behavior. Their behavior can give them insight as to how their feelings and emotions truly are. If a person regards their self as being smart, however they continuously receive bad grades over the years, that person might rearrange their thinking that they are not as smart as they previously thought. This helps readjust a person's thoughts in order to match their behavior better.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\nSelf-knowledge is a desire for the majority of human beings. In knowing about ourselves, we are more capable of knowing how to be socially acceptable and desirable. We seek out self-knowledge due to the [[Appraisal theory|appraisal motive]], self-enhancement motive, and consistency motive. The appraisal motive describes the desire to learn the truth about oneself in general. The self-enhancement motive is the desire to learn about one's good qualities only. The consistency motive is the desire to receive reinforcement of those preconceived notions that a person has about their self. This feedback will verify the thoughts and beliefs they already had relating to their self.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n:'''[[Self-awareness]]''' can be divided into two categories: private self-awareness and public self-awareness. Private self-awareness is defined as the self looking inward at oneself, including emotions, thoughts, beliefs, and feelings. All of these cannot be discovered by anyone else. Public self-awareness is defined by gathering information about your self through the perceptions of others. The actions and behaviors that others show towards a person will help that person establish a sense of how others perceive them. For example, if a person likes to sing, however many other people discourage their singing, that person can conclude that they might not be the best at singing. Therefore, in this situation, they are gaining public self-awareness about an aspect of themselves.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n:'''[[Self-esteem]]''' describes how a person evaluates their self positively or negatively. Four factors that contribute to self-esteem are the reactions we get from other people, how we compare people to ourselves, social roles, and our identification. Our social roles can sometimes be conceived as higher intelligence or ability, such as an Olympic athlete or biotechnologist. Other social roles might be stigmatized as being negative, such as a criminal or homeless person.<ref name= \"McLeod\">[http://www.simplypsychology.org/self-concept.html McLeod, S. A. (2008). Self Concept. Retrieved from simplypsychology.org]</ref> People with high self-esteem view their selves as containing positive traits. They are more willing to take more risks and aim for success. People with high self-esteem tend to be confident, gain self-acceptance, do not worry as much about what others think about them, and think more optimistically.<ref name=\"McLeod\"/> In contrast, people with low self-esteem view their selves as containing few or no positive traits, rather than viewing their selves as containing negative traits.<ref name=\"The Self\"/> It is rare for a person to rate their overall self as being terrible.<ref name=\"The Self\"/> People with low self-esteem typically:\n\n:*do not wish to fail\n:*are less confident in their success rate\n:*have confused and diverged notions about their self (self-concept confusion)\n:*focus on self-protection more so than [[self-enhancement]]\n:*are more prone to emotional imbalances<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n:*are less confident about their success than high self-esteemed people\n:*worry what others think about them consistently\n:*have more pessimistic thinking\n:*desire to resemble others more than high self-esteemed people<ref name=\"McLeod\"/>\n\n:Our self-concept entails the thoughts, feelings, and beliefs that each of us uniquely foster. However, many psychologists have questioned whether our self-concept is more realistic or filled with '''[[illusion]]s''' about ourselves and the world around us. Clinical psychologists have studied depressed people with perceived low self-esteem in order to observe if their perceptions were fabricated or not. Contrary to their hypothesis, they found that depressed people have a more realistic view of the world, the qualities they obtain, and the control they have over situations in their life. It was proposed by psychologists Shelley Taylor and Jonathon Brown that the majority of people in normal-functioning mental states display and are instilled with [[positive illusions]] including:<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n:*overestimating their own good qualities\n:*their control over happenings in their life\n:*an unrealistic portrayal of optimism<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n:Positive illusions remain constant for the majority of one's life due to self-deception. '''[[Self-deception]]''' strategies are mental tricks of a person's mind that hide the truth and constitute false beliefs. Due to self-deception, people are able to obtain resiliency upon negative events that might occur throughout life. This also can reinforce different ideas or thoughts that the person wishes and hopes for. The [[self-serving bias]] is a strategy in which a person titles acknowledgment for success and rejects blame for failure. For example, a person who wins a track meet would glorify their ability as an athlete. However, if that person were to come in last in the meet, the person would most likely put blame on constituting factors such as a muscle cramp or previous injury preventing a good performance. Another strategy that people use is greater criticism involving bad feedback rather than good. A person would judge a situation more harshly when they did worse, while the opposite would occur for a situation that entailed good feedback.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n===Interpersonal self===\nInterpersonal self can also be referred to as your public self. This feature allows for social connection to others. With the interpersonal self, a person is able to display themselves to the others around them. Interpersonal self is apparent in situations of self-presentation, being a group member or partner in a relationship, a person's social roles, and their reputation. For example, a person might show confidence and determination in their work atmosphere, whereas they show more of their emotional and nurturing side in their romantic relationship.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\nSocial roles are defined as the parts that a person plays in different situations and with other people. Our roles change in order to fit the \"expected\" behaviors in various scenarios. For example, a person may be a mother, a doctor, a wife, and daughter. Her behavior would most likely change in her transition from being a doctor to coming home to her daughter.<ref name=\"Social Roles and Social Norms\">[http://www.simplypsychology.org/social-roles.html McLeod, S. A. (2008). Social Roles and Social Norms. Retrieved from simplypsychology.org]</ref>\n\nSocial norms constitute the \"unwritten rules\" that we have about how to act in certain scenarios and with various people in our lives. For example, when a person is in a classroom, they are more likely to be quiet and attentive; whereas at a party, they are more likely to be socially engaged and standing. Norms act as guidelines that shape our behavior. Without them, there would not be any order, as well as lack of understanding in situations in society.<ref name=\"Social Roles and Social Norms\"/>\n\n===Agent self===\nThe agent self is known as the executive function that allows for actions. This is how we, as individuals, make choices and utilize our control in situations and actions. The agent self resides over everything that involves decision making, self-control, taking charge in situations, and actively responding. A person might desire to eat unhealthy foods, however it is their agent self that allows that person to choose to avoid eating them and make a healthier food choice.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n{{Main|Outline of self}}\n*[[Identity (social science)]]\n*[['I' and the 'me']]\n*[[Personality psychology|Personality]]\n*[[Self-concept]]\n*[[Self-discovery]]\n*[[Self-schema]]\n*[[Self (philosophy)]]\n*[[Self psychology]]\n*[[Self (sociology)]]\n*[[Ego (spirituality)]]\n*[[Ho'oponopono]]\n*[[Dialogical self]]\n*[[Reflexive self-consciousness]]\n*[[Future self]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.wilderdom.com/self Definitions of Various Self Constructs] - Self-esteem, self-efficacy, self-confidence & self-concept.\n*[http://www.emotionalcompetency.com/self.htm Discussion of Self] \u2013 Page of the Emotional Competency website.\n*[http://iautistic.com/autism-theory-of-mind-revisited.php Theory of Self] - Proposed by an autistic to explain autism\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=OE0yeuILAlMC&pg=PA1 Images of the Self]\n*[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/false-self False self]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Self (Psychology)}}\n[[Category:Self|*]]\n[[Category:Conceptions of self|Psychological]]\n[[Category:Ego psychology]]\n[[Category:Personal development]]\n\n[[cs:Bytostn\u00e9 j\u00e1]]\n[[da:Selvet (psykologi)]]\n[[fr:Soi (psychologie)]]\n[[ja:\u81ea\u5df1]]\n[[sk:Selbst]]\n[[sr:\u0408\u0430]]\n[[sv:Sj\u00e4lvet]]\n[[yi:\u05d6\u05e2\u05d9\u05dc]]\n[[zh:\u81ea\u6027]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|The study of either the cognitive, conative or affective representation of one's identity, or the subject of experience}}\n{{distinguish|Self psychology}}\nThe '''psychology of self''' is the study of either the [[cognitive]], [[Conative function|conative]] or [[affective]] representation of one's identity, or the subject of experience.

All parts of the self enable people to alter, change, add, and modify aspects of themselves in order to gain social acceptance in society.\n\nA useful accounting of contributing factors to what we call \"selfhood\" is the self gradually emerges and arises at the intersection between:\n*the habits in our biological-metabolic processes,\n*the socio-cultural habits of local culture inculcated into us,\n*our role models, good and bad,\n*how much responsibility the individual takes to make healthy choices gain and again, develop and strengthen their own Chooser self.\n\n==Kohut's formulation==\n{{Main|Heinz Kohut}}\nHeinz Kohut<ref>H. Kohut (1966), \"Forms and Transformations of Narcissism\" in C. Strozier (Ed.), ''Self Psychology and the Humanities'', New York: Norton, 1985 pp. 97\u2013123</ref> initially proposed a bipolar self compromising two systems of [[narcissistic]] perfection:'' 1) a system of ambitions and, 2) a system of ideals.''  Kohut called the pole of ambitions the ''narcissistic self'' (later, the ''grandiose self''<ref>H. Kohut (1971), ''The Analysis of the Self.'' New York: International Universities Press</ref>), while the pole of ideals was designated the ''idealized parental [[imago]]''. According to Kohut, these poles of the self represented natural progressions in the psychic life of infants and toddlers.\n\nKohut argued that when the child's ambitions and exhibitionistic strivings were chronically frustrated, arrests in the grandiose self led to the preservation of a false, expansive sense of self that could manifest outwardly in the visible [[grandiosity]] of the frank narcissist, or remain hidden from view, unless discovered in a narcissistic therapeutic [[transference]] (or ''selfobject transference'') that would expose these primitive grandiose fantasies and strivings.  Kohut termed this form of transference a ''mirror transference''.  In this transference, the strivings of the grandiose self are mobilized and the patient attempts to use the therapist to gratify these strivings.\n\nKohut proposed that arrests in the pole of ideals occurred when the child suffered chronic and excessive disappointment over the failings of early idealized figures.  Deficits in the pole of ideals were associated with the development of an idealizing transference to the therapist who becomes associated with the patient's primitive fantasies of omnipotent parental perfection.\n\nKohut believed that [[narcissistic injuries]] were inevitable and, in any case, necessary to temper ambitions and ideals with realism through the experience of more manageable frustrations and disappointments.  It was the chronicity and lack of recovery from these injuries (arising from a number of possible causes) that he regarded as central to the preservation of primitive self systems untempered by realism.\n\nAccording to the 1984 book, ''How Does Analysis Cure'',<ref>A. Goldberg and P. Stepansky (Eds.), ''How Does Analysis Cure'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press</ref> Kohut's observation of patients led him to propose two additional forms of transference associated with self deficits: ''1) the twinship and, 2) the merger transference''.  In his later years, Kohut believed that selfobject needs were both present and quite varied in normal individuals, as well as in narcissistic individuals.  To be clear, selfobjects are not external persons.  Kohut and Wolf, 1978<ref>\"Disorders of the Self and Their Treatment\", ''[[International Journal of Psychoanalysis]]'', 59: 413-425</ref> explain:\n\n''\"Self objects are objects which we experience as part of our self; the expected control over them is, therefore, closer to the concept of control which a grownup expects to have over his own body and mind than to the concept of control which he expects to have over others. (p.413)\"''\n\nKohut's notion of the self can be difficult to grasp because it is experience-distant, although it is posited based upon experience-near observation of the therapeutic transference.  Kohut relied heavily on empathy as a method of observation.  Specifically, the clinician's observations of his or her own feelings in the transference help the clinician see things from the subjective view of the patient\u2014to experience the world in ways that are closer to the way the patient experiences it. (note: Kohut did not regard empathy as curative. Empathy is a method of observation).\n\n==Winnicott's selves==\n{{Main|Donald Winnicott|True self and false self}}\nDonald Winnicott distinguished what he called the \"true self\" from the \"false self\" in the human personality, considering the true self as one based on the individual's sense of being, not doing, something which was rooted in the experiencing body.<ref>Josephine Klein, ''Our Need for Others and its Roots in Infancy'' (London 1994) p. 230</ref> As he memorably put it to [[Harry Guntrip]], 'You know about \"being active\", but not about \"just growing, just breathing\"':<ref>Quoted in Michael Parsons, ''The Dove that Return, the Dove that Vanishes'' (London 2000) p. 82</ref> it was the latter qualities that went to form the true self.\n\nNevertheless, Winnicott did not undervalue the role of the false self in the human personality, regarding it in fact as a necessary form of defensive organization \u2013 a kind of caretaker, a survival suit behind the protection of which the true self was able to continue to exist.<ref>Josephine Klein, ''Our Need for Others and its Roots in Infancy'' (London 1994) p.  318</ref>\nFive levels of false self organization were identified by Winnicott, running along a kind of continuum.<ref name=\"Jacki Watts 2009 p. 148\">Jacki Watts et al, ''Developmental Psychology'' (2009) p. 148</ref> \n# In the most severe instance,  the false self completely replaces and ousts the true self, leaving the latter a mere possibility.<ref>Jacki Watts et al, ''Developmental Psychology'' (2009) p. 149</ref>  \n# Less severely, the false self protects the true self, which remains unactualised - for Winnicott a clear example of a clinical condition organised for the positive goal of preserving the individual in spite of abnormal environmental conditions of the environment.\n# Closer to health, the false self supports the individual's search for conditions that will allow the true self to recover its well-being - its own identity.\n# Even closer to health, we find the false self \"... established on the basis of identifications\".<ref>D. W. Winnicott, ''The Maturational Processes and the Facilitating Environment'' (New York 1965) p. 121</ref>\n# Finally, in a healthy person, the false self is composed of that which facilitates social behavior, the manners and courtesy that allows for a smooth social life, with emotions expressed in socially acceptable forms.<ref name=\"Jacki Watts 2009 p. 148\"/>\n\nAs for the true self, Winnicott linked it both to playing, and to a kind of  \"hide and seek\"' designed to protect creative ownership of one's real self against exploitation,<ref>Rosalind Minsky, ''Psychoanalysis and Gender'' (1996) p. 121</ref> without entirely forfeiting the ability to relate to others.<ref>D. W. Winnicott, ''The Maturational Processes and the Facilitating Environment'' (New York 1965) p. 187</ref>\n\n==Berne's transactional analysis==\n<!--This section is linked from [[Inner critic]] ([[MOS:HEAD]])-->\n{{Main|Eric Berne|Transactional analysis}}\nIn his transactional analysis theory Eric Berne distinguished the personality's [[Transactional Analysis#The Ego-State (or Parent-Adult-Child, PAC) model|ego states]] - Parent, Adult and Child - from what he called 'the real Self, the one that can move from one ego state to another'.<ref>Eric Berne, ''What Do You Say After You Say Hello? (1974) p. 276</ref>\n* The parent ego consists of borrowed behaviors and feelings from previous caregivers. The parent ego can consist of either the Nurturing or Critical Parent.  The Nurturing Parent contains a more loving nature, whereas the Critical (or Prejudiced) Parent consists of preconceived ideas, thoughts, and behaviors learned from previous parents or caregivers. Some of this information can be beneficial, while others are not.\n* The adult ego is otherwise known as our data-processing center. This ego state is able to judge information based on facts, rather than emotions or preconceived beliefs.\n* The child ego is identified as the state that holds all of our memories, emotions, and feelings. People carry this ego state with them all of the time and can reflect back on it at any time. This state can also be divided into two segments: the Free (or Natural) child and the Adapted (and/or Rebellious) child. The Free child represents spontaneity, creativity, and a direct way of perceiving the world. Intimate relationships are able to form due to a person's contact with their own inner child. The less people are in touch with their inner child, the less they are able to form intimate relationships with other people. The Adapted child is the state in which people are able to comply and respond with parental commands and messages. If a parental command is viewed as too strong and demanding, a child ego can rebel against it, which is why this state can also become the Rebellious Child.<ref name=\"Transactional Analysis Theory: the Basics\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.carolsolomonphd.com/web_pdfs/Transact.pdf|title=Solomon, Carol, Ph.D. \"Transactional Analysis Theory: the Basics.\" Transactional Analysis Journal 33.1 (2003): 15-22.}}</ref>\nBerne considered that 'the feeling of \"Self\" is a mobile one. It can reside in any of the three ego states at any given moment, and can jump from one to the other as occasion arises'.<ref>Berne, p. 248-9</ref>\n\nA person's tone, gestures, choice of words, posture, and emotional state can portray which ego state they are currently in. By knowing about their own ego states, a person can use each one in particular situations in order to enhance their experience or make new social connections. For example, a person would most likely want to be in a Free Child state along with the Adult state while attending a party in order to maximize the fun they are having while also being able to make wise choices.<ref name=\"Transactional Analysis Theory: the Basics\"/>\n\nTransactions is another concept in the transactional theory that relates to how people of a certain ego state interact with people of the same or different ego state at a particular moment. Straight transactions are complementary and result in clear communication among other people. On the contrary, crossed transactions are of diverging ego states that make communication either hard or frustrating. These provoke emotional stress and negative feedback.<ref name=\"Transactional Analysis Theory: the Basics\"/> Nevertheless, Berne saw the Self as the most valuable part of the personality: 'when people get to know each other well, they penetrate into the depths where this real Self resides, and that is the part of the other person they respect and love'<ref>Berne, p. 276</ref>\n\n== Jungian archetype of the self ==\n{{Main|Self (Jung)}}\nIn classical Jungian analysis, the Self is the central archetype of several [[Jungian archetypes|archetype]]s, which are apriori or predispositions of responding to the world in particular ways.<ref name=\"Transpersonal Pioneers\">Fadiman, J. [http://www.sofia.edu/about/carl_jung.php Transpersonal Pioneers: Carl Jung.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425105134/http://www.sofia.edu/about/carl_jung.php |date=2013-04-25 }} Personality and Personal Growth. By R. Frager. Excerpt from ''Personality and Personal Growth'' 6th ed. New York: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2005. 56. Sofia University.</ref> The Self signifies the coherent whole, unifying both the consciousness and unconscious mind of a person. The Self, according to Jung, is the most important and difficult archetype to understand.<ref name=\"Transpersonal Pioneers\"/> It is realized as the product of individuation, which is defined as the process of integrating one's personality.<ref name=\"Man and his Symbols\"/> The self can appear to the individual both impersonally as dreams and images (circle, mandala, crystal, or stone) or personally (royal couple, divine child, or another divine symbol). Symbolic spiritual people, such as Christ and Mohammed, are also seen as symbols of the self, because they represent unity and equilibrium.<ref name=\"Transpersonal Pioneers\"/> The [[Wise Old Woman/Man]] can also serve as 'a symbolic personification of the Self'.<ref name=\"Man and his Symbols\">Marie-Louise von Franz, in C. G. Jung ed., ''Man and his Symbols'' (London 1978) p. 208</ref>\n\nWhat distinguishes classical Jungian psychology from earlier theories is the idea that there are two centers of the personality. The ego is the center of conscious identity, whereas the Self is the center of the total personality\u2014including consciousness, the unconscious, and the ego. The Self is both the whole and the center. While the ego is a self-contained little circle off the center contained within the whole, the Self can be understood as the greater circle.<ref name=\"Man and his Symbols\"/> People know of this Self, yet it is not known. Jung expresses it in this way: \"If the Self could be wholly experienced, it would be a limited experience, whereas in reality its experience is unlimited and endless.... If I were one with the Self I would have knowledge of everything, I would speak Sanskrit, read cuneiform script, know the events that took place in pre-history be acquainted with the life of other planets, etc.\"<ref name=\"Transpersonal Pioneers\"/>\n\nThe Self, besides being the centre of the psyche, is also autonomous, meaning that it exists outside of time and space. Jung also called the Self an ''[[imago dei]]''. The Self is the source of dreams and often appears as an authority figure in dreams with the ability to perceive the future or guide one in the present.<ref name=\"Thompson\">{{cite book | title=Waking, Dreaming, Being. Self and Consciousness in Neuroscience, Meditation, and Philosophy| author=Thompson, E | publisher=Columbia University Press | year=2017 | url=https://cup.columbia.edu/book/waking-dreaming-being/9780231137096}}</ref>\n\n==Critiques of the concept==\n'Selfhood' or complete autonomy is a common Western approach to psychology and models of self are employed constantly in areas such as [[psychotherapy]] and [[self-help]]. [[Edward E. Sampson]] (1989) argues that the preoccupation with independence is harmful in that it creates racial, sexual and national divides and does not allow for observation of the self-in-[[Other (philosophy)|other]] and other-in-self.\n\nThe very notion of selfhood has been attacked on the grounds that it is seen as necessary for the mechanisms of advanced capitalism to function. In ''Inventing our selves: Psychology, power, and personhood'', [[Nikolas Rose]] (1998) proposes that psychology is now employed as a technology that allows humans to buy into an invented and arguably false sense of self. In this way, '[[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s theories of self have been extensively developed by Rose to explore techniques of governance via self-formation...the self has to become an enterprising subject, acquiring [[cultural capital]] in order to gain employment',<ref>Lisa Adkins, ''Feminism after Bourdieu'' (2004) p. 78</ref> thus contributing to self-[[wikt:exploit|exploitation]].\n\n<!-- Commenting this out for now; needs to be written/explained more clearly: The quantifying and classifying process is referred to by [[Michel Foucault]] (1975, 1977) as being the issue of [[\u2018the calculable man']]: when the masses are classified they can be exploited as individuals and it is individuality that allows this to occur. -->\nIt is suggested by Kohut that for an individual to talk about, explain, understand or judge oneself is linguistically impossible, since it requires the self to understand its ''self''. This is seen as philosophically invalid, being self-referential, or [[Reification (fallacy)|reification]], also known as a [[circular argument]]. Thus, if actions arise so that the self attempts self-explanation, confusion may well occur within linguistic mental pathways and processes.\n\nAs for the theorists of the self, Winnicott has his critics, suggesting that his theory of the way 'the False Self is invented to manage a prematurely important object...enacts a kind of dissociated regard or recognition of the object'<ref>Adam Phillips, ''On Kissing, Tickling and Being Bored'' (1994) p. 31</ref> is itself rooted in 'his own childhood experience of trying to \"make my living\" by keeping his mother alive'.<ref>Minsky, p. 134</ref>\n\nThe self has long been considered as the central element and support of any experience.<ref name=Self>Tapu, CS (2001).

Premier, p. 114. {{ISBN|973-8030-59-5}}.</ref> The self is not 'permanently stuck into the heart of [[consciousness]]'.\n\"I am not always as intensively aware of me as an agent, as I am of my actions. That results from the fact that I perform only part of my actions, the other part being conducted by my thought, expression, practical operations, and so on.\"<ref name=Self />\n\n==Memory and the self==\n\nMemory and the self are interconnected with each other that, combined, can be defined as the Self-Memory System (SMS). The self is viewed as a combination of memories and self-images (working self). Conway proposes that a person's long-term memory and working self are dependent on each other. Our prior knowledge of our self puts constraints on what our working self is and the working self modifies the access to our long-term memory, as well as, what it consists of.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/k.allan/pages/dept/webfiles/4thyear/conway%202005%20jml.pdf|title=Conway, Martin A. \"Memory and the Self.\" Journal of Memory and Language 53 (2005): 594-628.

One example of this is a study by Conway and Ross,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Conway|first=Michael|last2=Ross|first2=Michael|title=Getting what you want by revising what you had.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=47|issue=4|pages=738\u2013748|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.47.4.738|year=1984}}</ref> which demonstrates that if a change in skill is expected, but there is no actual improvement, people will believe that their past skill state was worse than it was.\n\n=== Recalling Pain ===\nIn general recollection of pain is fairly accurate, although differences are seen between recollection of acute and chronic pain. Research suggests that recall for acute pain is more accurate than recall for chronic pain.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hunter|first=Myra|last2=Philips|first2=Clare|last3=Rachman|first3=Stanley|title=Memory for pain|journal=Pain|volume=6|issue=1|pages=35\u201346|doi=10.1016/0304-3959(79)90138-6|pmid=424233|year=1979}}</ref>\n\nAn interesting phenomenon seen in recollection of pain in the self is the peak-end phenomenon. Research has shown that when enduring painful experiences, people will 'prefer' more drawn out experiences that end with lower levels of pain, over shorter experiences that end with higher levels of pain, even though the shorter experiences provide less pain overall.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Redelmeier|first=Donald A|last2=Katz|first2=Joel|last3=Kahneman|first3=Daniel|title=Memories of colonoscopy: a randomized trial|journal=Pain|volume=104|issue=1|pages=187\u2013194|doi=10.1016/s0304-3959(03)00003-4|year=2003|hdl=10315/7959}}</ref>\n\nRecalled ratings of pain are more closely related to a combination of the peak pain in the experience, and the end pain of the experience.

The self is made up of three main parts that, incorporated, allow for the self to maintain its function. The parts of the self include: [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|Self-knowledge]], interpersonal self, and the agent self.<ref name=\"The Self\">Baumeister, Roy F., and Brad J. Bushman. \"The Self.\" Social Psychology and Human Nature. 2nd ed. Belmont, CA: Cengage Learning, 2011. 57\u201396. Print.</ref>\n\n===Self-knowledge===\n{{Main|Self-knowledge (psychology)}}\nSelf-knowledge is sometimes referred to as self-concept. This feature allows for people to gather information and beliefs about themselves. A person's self-awareness, self-esteem, and self-deception all fall under the self-knowledge part of self.  We learn about ourselves through our looking-glass selves, introspection, social comparisons, and self-perception.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\nThe '''[[looking glass self]]''' is a term to describe a theory that people learn about themselves through other people. In the looking-glass self proposal, a person visualizes how they appear to others, the person imagines how other people will judge them, and they then develop a response to the judgment they receive from other people. The response will likely be something viewed as pride or shame about themselves. The looking-glass self has proved to be partially accurate and inaccurate. A person's self-concept does not solely depend on how others view them. A person can view themselves as friendly; however they may appear to be quiet and uptight to another person that may not know them very well.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n'''[[Introspection]]''' refers to the manner in which a person gathers information about oneself through mental functions and emotions. Although a person might not know why they are thinking or feeling in such a way, they are able to know what it is they are feeling. However, developmental stages in life might affect introspection. In a Rosenburg study, children up to a certain stage in development showed that they knew that their parents actually knew them better than they knew themselves. Also, studies done by [[Richard E. Nisbett|Nisbett]] and [[Timothy Wilson|Wilson]] uncovered the fact that people might not actually know what they are thinking all of the time. In one particular study, they discovered that many people bought the first stockings that they saw and gave the reasoning behind their choice for buying being based on the color or softness. So, in conclusion, introspection is a way of gaining knowledge about yourself through your inner emotions and thinking, however it is a conscious part of the brain. The automatic part of the brain can make us do a lot of unconscious acts that people have no reasoning for.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n'''Social comparison''' is regarded as the way in which we compare ourselves to other people around us. By looking to other people, we can rate our work and behaviors as good, neutral, or bad. The most beneficial or useful comparisons are those of people that are in the same category as ourselves. For example, a high school football player would be more appropriate in comparing himself to an all-star high school football player, rather than a Super Bowl-winning football player with over 10 years of experience. An upward social comparison refers to a person comparing themself to a person that is perceived as better than them in a particular area. This can be either motivational or discouraging to the person comparing themself. A downward social comparison refers to a person comparing themself to a person that is perceived as worse than them, which can make that person feel better about their self.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\nThe '''[[self-perception theory]]''' is another theory in which a person infers about themselves through their behavior. Their behavior can give them insight as to how their feelings and emotions truly are. If a person regards their self as being smart, however they continuously receive bad grades over the years, that person might rearrange their thinking that they are not as smart as they previously thought. This helps readjust a person's thoughts in order to match their behavior better.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\nSelf-knowledge is a desire for the majority of human beings. In knowing about ourselves, we are more capable of knowing how to be socially acceptable and desirable. We seek out self-knowledge due to the [[Appraisal theory|appraisal motive]], self-enhancement motive, and consistency motive. The appraisal motive describes the desire to learn the truth about oneself in general. The self-enhancement motive is the desire to learn about one's good qualities only. The consistency motive is the desire to receive reinforcement of those preconceived notions that a person has about their self. This feedback will verify the thoughts and beliefs they already had relating to their self.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n:'''[[Self-awareness]]''' can be divided into two categories: private self-awareness and public self-awareness. Private self-awareness is defined as the self looking inward at oneself, including emotions, thoughts, beliefs, and feelings. All of these cannot be discovered by anyone else. Public self-awareness is defined by gathering information about your self through the perceptions of others. The actions and behaviors that others show towards a person will help that person establish a sense of how others perceive them. For example, if a person likes to sing, however many other people discourage their singing, that person can conclude that they might not be the best at singing. Therefore, in this situation, they are gaining public self-awareness about an aspect of themselves.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n:'''[[Self-esteem]]''' describes how a person evaluates their self positively or negatively. Four factors that contribute to self-esteem are the reactions we get from other people, how we compare people to ourselves, social roles, and our identification. Our social roles can sometimes be conceived as higher intelligence or ability, such as an Olympic athlete or biotechnologist. Other social roles might be stigmatized as being negative, such as a criminal or homeless person.<ref name= \"McLeod\">[http://www.simplypsychology.org/self-concept.html McLeod, S. A. (2008). Self Concept. Retrieved from simplypsychology.org]</ref> People with high self-esteem view their selves as containing positive traits. They are more willing to take more risks and aim for success. People with high self-esteem tend to be confident, gain self-acceptance, do not worry as much about what others think about them, and think more optimistically.<ref name=\"McLeod\"/> In contrast, people with low self-esteem view their selves as containing few or no positive traits, rather than viewing their selves as containing negative traits.<ref name=\"The Self\"/> It is rare for a person to rate their overall self as being terrible.<ref name=\"The Self\"/> People with low self-esteem typically:\n\n:*do not wish to fail\n:*are less confident in their success rate\n:*have confused and diverged notions about their self (self-concept confusion)\n:*focus on self-protection more so than [[self-enhancement]]\n:*are more prone to emotional imbalances<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n:*are less confident about their success than high self-esteemed people\n:*worry what others think about them consistently\n:*have more pessimistic thinking\n:*desire to resemble others more than high self-esteemed people<ref name=\"McLeod\"/>\n\n:Our self-concept entails the thoughts, feelings, and beliefs that each of us uniquely foster. However, many psychologists have questioned whether our self-concept is more realistic or filled with '''[[illusion]]s''' about ourselves and the world around us. Clinical psychologists have studied depressed people with perceived low self-esteem in order to observe if their perceptions were fabricated or not. Contrary to their hypothesis, they found that depressed people have a more realistic view of the world, the qualities they obtain, and the control they have over situations in their life. It was proposed by psychologists Shelley Taylor and Jonathon Brown that the majority of people in normal-functioning mental states display and are instilled with [[positive illusions]] including:<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n:*overestimating their own good qualities\n:*their control over happenings in their life\n:*an unrealistic portrayal of optimism<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n:Positive illusions remain constant for the majority of one's life due to self-deception. '''[[Self-deception]]''' strategies are mental tricks of a person's mind that hide the truth and constitute false beliefs. Due to self-deception, people are able to obtain resiliency upon negative events that might occur throughout life. This also can reinforce different ideas or thoughts that the person wishes and hopes for. The [[self-serving bias]] is a strategy in which a person titles acknowledgment for success and rejects blame for failure. For example, a person who wins a track meet would glorify their ability as an athlete. However, if that person were to come in last in the meet, the person would most likely put blame on constituting factors such as a muscle cramp or previous injury preventing a good performance. Another strategy that people use is greater criticism involving bad feedback rather than good. A person would judge a situation more harshly when they did worse, while the opposite would occur for a situation that entailed good feedback.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n===Interpersonal self===\nInterpersonal self can also be referred to as your public self. This feature allows for social connection to others. With the interpersonal self, a person is able to display themselves to the others around them. Interpersonal self is apparent in situations of self-presentation, being a group member or partner in a relationship, a person's social roles, and their reputation. For example, a person might show confidence and determination in their work atmosphere, whereas they show more of their emotional and nurturing side in their romantic relationship.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\nSocial roles are defined as the parts that a person plays in different situations and with other people. Our roles change in order to fit the \"expected\" behaviors in various scenarios. For example, a person may be a mother, a doctor, a wife, and daughter. Her behavior would most likely change in her transition from being a doctor to coming home to her daughter.<ref name=\"Social Roles and Social Norms\">[http://www.simplypsychology.org/social-roles.html McLeod, S. A. (2008). Social Roles and Social Norms. Retrieved from simplypsychology.org]</ref>\n\nSocial norms constitute the \"unwritten rules\" that we have about how to act in certain scenarios and with various people in our lives. For example, when a person is in a classroom, they are more likely to be quiet and attentive; whereas at a party, they are more likely to be socially engaged and standing. Norms act as guidelines that shape our behavior. Without them, there would not be any order, as well as lack of understanding in situations in society.<ref name=\"Social Roles and Social Norms\"/>\n\n===Agent self===\nThe agent self is known as the executive function that allows for actions. This is how we, as individuals, make choices and utilize our control in situations and actions. The agent self resides over everything that involves decision making, self-control, taking charge in situations, and actively responding. A person might desire to eat unhealthy foods, however it is their agent self that allows that person to choose to avoid eating them and make a healthier food choice.<ref name=\"The Self\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n{{Main|Outline of self}}\n*[[Identity (social science)]]\n*[['I' and the 'me']]\n*[[Personality psychology|Personality]]\n*[[Self-concept]]\n*[[Self-discovery]]\n*[[Self-schema]]\n*[[Self (philosophy)]]\n*[[Self psychology]]\n*[[Self (sociology)]]\n*[[Ego (spirituality)]]\n*[[Ho'oponopono]]\n*[[Dialogical self]]\n*[[Reflexive self-consciousness]]\n*[[Future self]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.wilderdom.com/self Definitions of Various Self Constructs] - Self-esteem, self-efficacy, self-confidence & self-concept.\n*[http://www.emotionalcompetency.com/self.htm Discussion of Self] \u2013 Page of the Emotional Competency website.\n*[http://iautistic.com/autism-theory-of-mind-revisited.php Theory of Self] - Proposed by an autistic to explain autism\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=OE0yeuILAlMC&pg=PA1 Images of the Self]\n*[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/false-self False self]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Self (Psychology)}}\n[[Category:Self|*]]\n[[Category:Conceptions of self|Psychological]]\n[[Category:Ego psychology]]\n[[Category:Personal development]]\n\n[[cs:Bytostn\u00e9 j\u00e1]]\n[[da:Selvet (psykologi)]]\n[[fr:Soi (psychologie)]]\n[[ja:\u81ea\u5df1]]\n[[sk:Selbst]]\n[[sr:\u0408\u0430]]\n[[sv:Sj\u00e4lvet]]\n[[yi:\u05d6\u05e2\u05d9\u05dc]]\n[[zh:\u81ea\u6027]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "Journal cites:,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology_of_self"}

Government attempts at filtering have not been entirely effective, as blocked content has quickly migrated to other Web sites and users have found ways to circumvent filtering. The government has also been criticised for a poor understanding of the technical feasibility of censorship and for haphazardly choosing which Web sites to block.

Government attempts at filtering have not been entirely effective, as blocked content has quickly migrated to other Web sites and users have found ways to circumvent filtering. The government has also been criticised for a poor understanding of the technical feasibility of censorship and for haphazardly choosing which Web sites to block.

Typically, quilting is done with three layers: the top fabric or quilt top, [[Batting (material)|batting]] or insulating material and backing material, but many different styles are adopted.\n\nThe process of quilting uses a [[Sewing needle|needle]] and [[yarn|thread]] to join two or more layers of material to make a quilt. The quilter's hand or [[sewing machine]] passes the needle and thread through all layers and then brings the needle back up. The process is repeated across the entire area where quilting is wanted. Rocking, straight or [[running stitch]]es are commonly used with these stitches being functional and/or decorative. Quilting is done to create bed coverings, art quilt wall hangings, clothing, and a variety of textile products. Quilting can produce different effects depending on the chosen pattern(s), such as a uniform effect across the material, or with dense quilting, can flatten one area so that another stands out.\n\nThe whole process of creating a quilt or quilted garment also involves other steps such as designing, cutting, piecing, appliqu\u00e9, and binding. A person who works at quilting is termed a '''quilter'''. Quilting can be done by hand, via a [[sewing machine]], or by a specialized [[longarm quilting]] system.\n\nQuilt stores often sell fabric, thread, patterns and other goods that are used for quilting. They often have group sewing and quilting classes where one can learn how to sew or quilt.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of quilting}}\n===Early quilting===\nThe origins of quilting remain unknown but sewing techniques of piecing, [[appliqu\u00e9]], and quilting have been used for clothing and furnishings in diverse parts of the world for several millennia.\n\nThe earliest known quilted garment is depicted on the carved ivory figure of a [[Pharaoh]] dating from the [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]] ({{circa|3400 BC}}). In 1924 archaeologists discovered a quilted floor covering in [[Mongolia]], estimated to date between 100&nbsp;BC and 200&nbsp;AD.\n\nIn Europe, quilting has been part of the needlework tradition from about the fifth century, with early objects containing Egyptian cotton, which may indicate that Egyptian and Mediterranean trade provided a conduit for the technique. However, quilted objects were relatively rare in Europe until approximately the twelfth century, when quilted bedding and other items appeared after the return of the Crusaders from the Middle East.  The medieval quilted gambeson, [[aketon]] and [[arming doublet]]<ref>[http://www.chronique.com/Library/Armour/armyd1.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228020504/http://www.chronique.com/Library/Armour/armyd1.htm |date=December 28, 2011 }}</ref> were garments worn under or instead of armor of [[maille]] or [[plate armor]].  These developed into the later quilted [[Doublet (clothing)|doublet]] worn as part of fashionable European male clothing from the fourteenth to seventeenth century.  The earliest known surviving European bed quilt is from late-fourteenth-century Sicily: the [[Tristan Quilt|Tristan quilt]] made of linen and padded with wool. The blocks across the center are scenes from the legend of [[Tristan]].

Paper was cut into shapes and used as a pattern; each individual piece of cut fabric was basted around the paper pattern.  Paper was a scarce commodity in the early American west so women would save letters from home, postcards, newspaper clippings, and catalogs to use as patterns.  The paper not only served as a pattern but as an insulator.  The paper found between the old quilts has become a primary source of information about pioneer life.\n\nQuilts made without any insulation or batting were referred to as summer quilts. They were not made for warmth, only to keep the chill off during cooler summer evenings.\n\n====African-American [[quilts]]====\nThere is a long tradition of African-American quilting beginning with quilts made by slaves, both for themselves and for their owners. The style of these quilts was determined largely by time period and region, rather than race, and the documented slave-made quilts generally resemble those made by white women in their region.<ref>{{cite book |title=Facts & Fabrications: Unraveling the History of Quilts & Slavery |last=Brackman |first=Barbara |publisher=C&T Publishing |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-57120-364-9 |location=Concord |pages=15}}</ref> After 1865 and the end of slavery in the United States, African-Americans began to develop their own distinctive style of quilting.\n[[Harriet Powers]], a slave-born African American woman, made two famous story quilts.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |title = Blooming Patchwork|last = Eisenmann|first = Deanne|publisher = Kansas City Star Books|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-61169-144-3|location = Kansas City, MO|pages = 12}}</ref> She was just one of the many African-American [[quilter]]s who contributed to the evolution of quilting.

Consensus among historians is that there is no sound basis for this belief, and no documented mention among the thousands of [[slave narratives]] or other contemporary records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofquilts.com/underground-railroad.html|title=Underground Railroad Quilts: Documentary Evidence is Missing|author=|date=|website=www.historyofquilts.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quilthistory.com/ugrrquilts.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 23, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204013739/http://www.quilthistory.com/ugrrquilts.htm |archivedate=February 4, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.womenfolk.com/quilt_pattern_history/underground_railroad.htm|title=The Jacob's Ladder Pattern Became the Underground Railroad Quilt|author=|date=|website=www.womenfolk.com}}</ref>\n\n==== Amish quilts ====\nAnother American group to develop a distinct style of quilting were the [[Amish]]. Typically, these quilts use only solid fabrics, are pieced from geometric shapes, do not contain appliqu\u00e9, and construction is simple (corners are butted, rather than mitered, for instance) and done entirely by hand. Amish quilters also tend to use simple patterns: [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]] Amish are known for their Diamond-in-a-Square and Bars patterns, while other communities use patterns such as Brick, Streak of Lightning, Chinese Coins, and Log Cabins, and midwestern communities are known for their repeating block patterns. Borders and color choice also vary by community. For example, Lancaster quilts feature wide borders with lavish quilting, while Midwestern quilts feature narrower borders to balance the fancier piecing.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Amish Quilts\u2013The Adventure Continues|last = Koolish|first = Lynn|publisher = C&T Publishing|year = 2013|isbn = 978-1-60705-791-8|location = Concord|pages = 9\u201310}}</ref>\n\n==== Native American quilts ====\n[[File:Native Baby and Star Quilt.jpg|thumbnail|right|Native American Baby in cradle board with baby star quilt]]\nSome [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] are thought to have learned quilting through observation of white settlers; others learned it from [[Missionary|missionaries]] who taught quilting to Native American women along with other homemaking skills. Native American women quickly developed their own unique style, the Lone Star design (also called the Star of Bethlehem), a variation on Morning Star designs that had been featured on Native American clothing and other items for centuries. These quilts often featured floral appliqu\u00e9 framing the star design. Star quilts have become an important part of many [[Plains Indians |Plains Indian]] ceremonies, replacing buffalo robes traditionally given away at births, marriages, tribal elections, and other ceremonies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Murphy |first1=Mary |title=Montana Quilts and Quiltmakers: A History of Work and Beauty |journal=Montana The Magazine of Western History |date=Autumn 2008 |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=39\u201340 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/25485734 |accessdate=22 February 2020}}</ref> Pictorial quilts, created with appliqu\u00e9, were also common.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAnother distinctive style of Native American quilting is [[Seminole]] piecing, created by Seminoles living in the [[Everglades|Florida Everglades]]. The style evolved out a need for cloth (the closest town was often a week's journey away). Women would make strips of sewing the remnants of fabric rolls together, then sew these into larger pieces to make clothing. Eventually the style began to be used not just for clothing but for quilts as well. In 1900, with the introduction of sewing machines and readily available fabric in Seminole communities, the patterns became much more elaborate and the style continues to be in use today, both by Seminole women and by others who have copied and adapted their designs and techniques.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Hawaiian quilting====\n\"[[Hawaiian quilt]]ing was well established by the beginning of the twentieth century. Hawaiian women learned to quilt from the wives of missionaries from New England in the 1820s. Though they learned both pieced work and applique, by the 1870s they had adapted applique techniques to create a uniquely Hawaiian mode of expression. The classic Hawaiian quilt design is a large, bold, curvilinear appliqu\u00e9 pattern that covers much of the surface of the quilt, with the symmetrical design cut from only one piece of fabric.\"<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Quilts|year=2003|title=The Encyclopedia of American Folk Art|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/routfolkart/quilts|ISBN=978-0203644485|publisher=Florence Taylor and Francis |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan }}</ref>\n\n=== South Asian quilting ===\nThere are two primary forms of quilting that originate in [[South Asia]]: [[Nakshi kantha|Nakshi Kantha]] and [[Ralli quilt|Ralli]]. Nakshi Kantha quilts originated in India and are typically made of scraps and worn-out fabric stitched together with old sari threads using [[kantha]] embroidery stitches. \"The layers of cloth were spread on the ground, held in place with weights at the edges, and sewn together with rows of large basting stitches. The cloth was then folded and worked on whenever there was time.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> The first recorded kantha are more than 500 years old.\n\nRalli quilts are traditionally made in [[Pakistan]], western [[India]], and the surrounding area. They are made by every sector of society including [[Hindu]] and [[Muslim]] women, women of different castes, and women from different towns or villages or tribes with the colors and designs varying among these groups. The name comes from ''ralanna'', a word meaning to mix or connect. Quilts tops were designed and pieced by one woman using scraps of hand-dyed cotton. This cotton often comes from old dresses or shawls. Once pieced, the quilt top is placed on a reed mat with the other layers and sewn together using thick, colored thread in straight parallel lines by members of the designer's family and community.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Swedish quilting ===\nQuilting originated in [[Sweden]] in the fifteenth century with heavily stitched and appliqu\u00e9d quilts made for the very wealthy. These quilts, created from silk, wool, and felt, were intended to be both decorative and functional and were found in churches and in the homes of nobility. Imported cotton first appeared in Sweden in 1870, and began to appear in Swedish quilts soon after along with scraps of wool, silk, and linen. As the availability of cotton increased and its price went down, quilting became widespread among all classes of Swedish society. Wealthier quilters used wool batting while others used linen scraps, rags, or paper mixed with animal hair. In general, these quilts were simple and narrow,  made by both men and women. The biggest influence on Swedish quilting in this time period is thought to have come from America as Swedish immigrants to the United States returned to their home country when conditions there improved.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Art quilting===\nDuring the late 20th century, [[art quilts]] became popular for their aesthetic and artistic qualities rather than for functionality as they are displayed on a wall or table rather than being used on a bed.. \"It is believed that decorative quilting came to Europe and Asia during the Crusades (A.D. 1100\u20131300), a likely idea because textile arts were more developed in China and India than in the West.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Bial|first=Raymond|title=With Needle and Thread|url=https://archive.org/details/withneedlethread0000bial|url-access=registration|year=1996|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|location=Boston; New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/withneedlethread0000bial/page/18 18]}}</ref>\n\n=== Modern quilting ===\nIn the early 21st century, modern quilting became a more prominent area of quilting.

As industrial sewing technology has become more precise and flexible, quilting using exotic fabrics and embroidery began to appear in home furnishings in the early 21st century.\n\n===Quilt blocks===\nThe quilt block is traditionally a sub-unit composed of several pieces of fabric sewn together. The quilt blocks are repeated, or sometimes alternated with plain blocks, to form the overall design of a quilt. Barbara Brackman has documented over 4000 different quilt block patterns from the early 1830s to the 1970s in the ''Encyclopedia Of Pieced Quilt Patterns''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Pieced Quilt Patterns|last=Brackman|first=Barbara|publisher=American Quilter's Society|year=1993|isbn=978-0891458159|location=Paducah, KY|pages=552}}</ref> Some of the simpler designs for quilt blocks include the Nine-Patch, Shoo Fly, Churn Dash, and the Prairie Queen.\n\nMost geometric quilt block designs fit into a \"grid,\" the number of squares a pattern block is divided into. The five categories into which most square patterns fall are Four Patch, Nine Patch, Five-Patch, Seven-Patch, and Eight-Pointed Star.

The two most widely used are hand-quilting and machine quilting.\n\n'''Hand quilting''' is the process of using a [[Sewing needle|needle]] and [[yarn|thread]] to sew a [[running stitch]] by hand across the entire area to be quilted. This binds the layers together. A quilting frame or hoop is often used to assist in holding the piece being quilted off the quilter's lap. A quilter can make one stitch at a time by first driving the needle through the fabric from the right side, then pushing it back up through the material from the wrong side to complete the stitch; this is called a stab stitch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barbrobson.com/journal/2011/7/1/stab-stitch-quilting.html|title=Stab Stitch Quilting|work=Barbara Robson}}</ref> Another option is called a rocking stitch, where the quilter has one hand, usually with a finger wearing a [[thimble]], on top of the quilt, while the other hand is located beneath the piece to push the needle back up.<ref>{{Cite book|title = All Things Quilting with Alex Anderson|last = Anderson|first = Alex|publisher = C&T Publishing|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-60705-856-4|location = Concord, CA|pages = 132}}</ref> A third option is called \"loading the needle\" and involves doing four or more stitches before pulling the needle through the cloth. Hand quilting is still practiced by the Amish and Mennonites within the United States and Canada, and is enjoying a resurgence worldwide.\n[[File:Quilting machine in Haikou.webm|thumb|Quilting machine in [[Haikou]], Hainan, China]]\n'''Machine quilting''' is the process of using a home [[sewing machine]] or a longarm machine to sew the layers together. With the home sewing machine, the layers are tacked together before quilting. This involves laying the top, batting, and backing out on a flat surface and either pinning (using large safety pins) or [[tack (sewing)|tacking]] the layers together.<ref>{{Cite book|title = All Things Quilting with Alex Anderson|last = Anderson|first = Alex|publisher = C&T Publishing|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-60705-856-4|location = Concord, CA|pages = 129\u2013130}}</ref> [[Longarm quilting]] involves placing the layers to be quilted on a special frame. The frame has bars on which the layers are rolled, keeping these together without the need for tacking or pinning. These frames are used with a professional sewing machine mounted on a platform. The platform rides along tracks so that the machine can be moved across the layers on the frame. A longarm machine is moved across the fabric. In contrast, the fabric is moved through a home sewing machine.\n\n'''Tying''' is another technique of fastening the three layers together. This is done primarily on quilts that are made to be used and are needed quickly. The process of <!-- dead link: http://www.nmia.com/~mgdesign/qor/begin/tying.htm--> tying the quilt is done with [[yarn]]s or multiple strands of [[thread (yarn)|thread]]. [[Reef knot|Square knot]]s are used to finish off the ties so that the quilt may be washed and used without fear of the knots coming undone.<ref>{{Cite book|title = All Things Quilting with Alex Anderson|last = Anderson|first = Alex|publisher = C&T Publishing|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-60705-856-4|location = Concord, CA|pages = 154}}</ref> This technique is commonly called \"tacking.\"  In the Midwest, tacked bed covers are referred to as comforters.\n\nQuilting is now taught in some American schools.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cehs.unl.edu/tmfd/ma-textile-historyquilt-studies-distance-learning-option-iii/|title=MA \u2013 Textile History/Quilt Studies Distance Learning Option III {{!}} College of Education and Human Sciences|website=cehs.unl.edu|access-date=2019-06-16}}</ref><!--which DT? a mystery to non-Americans \u2013 ch: is this any better?--> It is also taught at senior centers around the U.S., but quilters of all ages attend classes. These forms of workshops or classes are also available in other countries in guilds and community colleges.\n\nContemporary quilters use a  wide range of quilting designs and styles, from ancient and ethnic to post-modern futuristic patterns. There is no one single school or style that dominates the quilt-making world. Regardless of skill level, all quilters know the importance of having the right tools when quilting. Having the right tools increases the fluid process of making a quilt and can even be improved over time with practice. Having the right tools will maximize efficiency and make the quilting experience one to remember. Below is a list of the different tools and tips that can be used to make a quilt by hand or machine:<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.Quilting101.com|title=Quilting 101 \u2013 Quilt making tips and resources|publisher=Quilting|accessdate=28 January 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web|last=Cox|first=Meg|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles|work=The Wall Street Journal|title='Modern Quilters' Stress Simplicity, Edgy Subjects|date=May 9, 2013|accessdate=28 January 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Sewing machine]]\n\nA good quality sewing machine is a helpful addition to the process of piecing together a quilt top. Some also use a home sewing machine for quilting together the layers of the quilt, as well as binding the final product. While almost all home sewing machines can be used to quilt layers together, having a wide [https://janome.com.au/what-makes-a-quilting-machine-different-from-a-sewing-machine/ throat], the space to the right of the needle mechanism, is very helpful because it is easier to manipulate a bulky quilt through the machine when the throat is both high and long. It is important to understand how your particular model functions in order to select the correct settings, thread the needle and bobbin, and operate the machine. [https://aquietrefuge.com/sewing-machine-noise-reduction/ Here is a handy guide on using a machine.]\n*Fabric Markers or Ruler\nWhen making a quilt it is important to mark the fabric that you are cutting in order to have some kind of guidance when cutting the fabric, or you could use a quilting ruler and rotary cutter. When marking the fabric it is advised that you use a fabric marker, which is a marker that washes out when the quilt is washed or will fade away after repeated washes.<ref name=\"auto1\" />\n[[File:Quilting Studio 005.jpg|thumb|Longarm quilting machine]]\n*[[Longarm quilting]] Machines\nThe longarm quilting machine makes it easier to make larger quilts because of the extended arm that is used. Being able to leverage the larger machine and not having to hold the material that is being used while quilting helps the process move along much faster and makes it easier on the quilter.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Some quilt shops offer longarm services, where one can pay for their project to be quilted and in some cases, bound as well. \n*Machine Quilting Needles\n\nWhen quilting, one of the most important tools that is used is the [[Sewing needle|needle]]. Whether you are quilting by hand or by machine, the needle that is being used is critical to the final result. Using the wrong needle can lead to puckering, bumps, or even the material being torn. Machine quilting needs a sharp needle to easily pierce the three-part quilt sandwich and properly sew together the quilt top, batting and backing.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>  \n\n* Hand Quilting Needles\n\nThe traditional needles used for quilting are called ''betweens'' and are generally smaller and stronger than normal sewing needles. They have a very small eye which prevents any extra bump at the head of the needles when you are pulling through the thread.<ref name=\"auto1\" /> \n\n*Pins and Thimbles\nUnderstanding how [[pin]]s and [[thimble]]s work is also very important in the process of making quilts. Many different combinations of pinning can be used in order get similar results and the exciting part is figuring out existing combinations as well as coming up with new ones. Thimbles are not required but are good for keeping fingers safe.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> \n*Threads\nChoosing the right types of threads for a quilt can be difficult and beginners may need some assistance from an expert or more advanced quilter. The color, composition, and type of thread that is used will have a pivotal role in the outcome of the final quilt.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> \n*Rotary Cutters and Boards\nWhat a quilter uses to cut the fabric is a vital step in the quilting process. It is very important each piece is perfectly aligned in order to prevent an uneven or sloppy appearance and to prevent rework. Rotary cutters revolutionized quiltmaking when they appeared in the late 1970s. A rotary cutter offers even the shakiest of hands the ability to produce perfect, even slices and minimizes the chance of error.<ref>{{Cite book|title = All Things Quilting with Alex Anderson|last = Anderson|first = Alex|publisher = C&T Publishing|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-60705-856-4|location = Concord, CA|page = 36}}</ref>\n*Quilting Templates/Patterns\nQuilts can have many different templates or patterns and they can have a large impact on the final result. There are a number of mediums that can be used and depending on the usage, size, and style they will give your quilt a varied look. Templates are generally considered the basis of the structure of the quilt, like a blueprint for a house. If used properly it can help quilters produce a quilt of their liking and give them a sense of satisfaction and vision for future quilts they want to make.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n== Specialty styles ==\n*[[Foundation piecing]] \u2013 also known as paper-piecing \u2013 sewing pieces of fabric onto a temporary or permanent foundation\n* [[Shadow quilting|Shadow]] or [[echo quilting]] \u2013 Hawaiian quilting, where quilting is done around an appliqu\u00e9d piece on the quilt top, then the quilting is echoed again and again around the previous quilting line.\n*[[Ralli quilting]] \u2013 Pakistani and Indian quilting, often associated with the Sindh (Pakistan) and Gujarat (India) regions.\n*[[Sashiko stitching]] \u2013 Basic running stitch worked in heavy, white cotton thread usually on dark indigo colored fabric.

Typically, quilting is done with three layers: the top fabric or quilt top, [[Batting (material)|batting]] or insulating material and backing material, but many different styles are adopted.\n\nThe process of quilting uses a [[Sewing needle|needle]] and [[yarn|thread]] to join two or more layers of material to make a quilt. The quilter's hand or [[sewing machine]] passes the needle and thread through all layers and then brings the needle back up. The process is repeated across the entire area where quilting is wanted. Rocking, straight or [[running stitch]]es are commonly used with these  stitches being functional and/or decorative. Quilting is done to create bed coverings, art quilt wall hangings, clothing, and a variety of textile products. Quilting can produce different effects depending on the chosen pattern(s), such as a uniform effect across the material, or with dense quilting, can flatten one area so that another stands out.\n\nThe whole process of creating a quilt or quilted garment also involves other steps such as designing, cutting, piecing, appliqu\u00e9, and binding. A person who works at quilting is termed a '''quilter'''. Quilting can be done by hand, via a [[sewing machine]], or by a specialized [[longarm quilting]] system.\n\nQuilt stores often sell fabric, thread, patterns and other goods that are used for quilting. They often have group sewing and quilting classes where one can learn how to sew or quilt.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of quilting}}\n===Early quilting===\nThe origins of quilting remain unknown but sewing techniques of piecing, [[appliqu\u00e9]], and quilting have been used for clothing and furnishings in diverse parts of the world for several millennia.\n\nThe earliest known quilted garment is depicted on the carved ivory figure of a [[Pharaoh]] dating from the [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]] ({{circa|3400 BC}}). In 1924 archaeologists discovered a quilted floor covering in [[Mongolia]], estimated to date between 100&nbsp;BC and 200&nbsp;AD.\n\nIn Europe, quilting has been part of the needlework tradition from about the fifth century, with  early objects containing Egyptian cotton, which may indicate that Egyptian and Mediterranean trade provided a conduit for the technique. However, quilted objects were relatively rare in Europe until approximately the twelfth century, when quilted bedding and other items appeared after the return of the Crusaders from the Middle East.  The medieval quilted gambeson, [[aketon]] and [[arming doublet]]<ref>[http://www.chronique.com/Library/Armour/armyd1.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111228020504/http://www.chronique.com/Library/Armour/armyd1.htm |date=December 28, 2011 }}</ref> were garments worn under or instead of armor of [[maille]] or [[plate armor]].  These developed into the later quilted [[Doublet (clothing)|doublet]] worn as part of fashionable European male clothing from the fourteenth to seventeenth century.

Paper was cut into shapes and used as a pattern; each individual piece of cut fabric was basted around the paper pattern.  Paper was a scarce commodity in the early American west so women would save letters from home, postcards, newspaper clippings, and catalogs to use as patterns.  The paper not only served as a pattern but as an insulator.  The paper found between the old quilts has become a primary source of information about pioneer life.\n\nQuilts made without any insulation or batting were referred to as summer quilts. They were not made for warmth, only to keep the chill off during cooler summer evenings.\n\n====African-American [[quilts]]====\nThere is a long tradition of African-American quilting beginning with quilts made by slaves, both for themselves and for their owners.

Typically, these quilts use only solid fabrics, are pieced from geometric shapes, do not contain appliqu\u00e9, and construction is simple (corners are butted, rather than mitered, for instance) and done entirely by hand. Amish quilters also tend to use simple patterns: [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania|Lancaster County]] Amish are known for their Diamond-in-a-Square and Bars patterns, while other communities use patterns such as Brick, Streak of Lightning, Chinese Coins, and Log Cabins, and midwestern communities are known for their repeating block patterns. Borders and color choice also vary by community. For example, Lancaster quilts feature wide borders with lavish quilting, while Midwestern quilts feature narrower borders to balance the fancier piecing.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Amish Quilts\u2013The Adventure Continues|last = Koolish|first = Lynn|publisher = C&T Publishing|year = 2013|isbn = 978-1-60705-791-8|location = Concord|pages = 9\u201310}}</ref>\n\n==== Native American quilts ====\n[[File:Native Baby and Star Quilt.jpg|thumbnail|right|Native American Baby in cradle board with baby star quilt]]\nSome [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] are thought to have learned quilting through observation of white settlers; others learned it from [[Missionary|missionaries]] who taught quilting to Native American women along with other homemaking skills. Native American women quickly developed their own unique style, the Lone Star design (also called the Star of Bethlehem), a variation on Morning Star designs that had been featured on Native American clothing and other items for centuries. These quilts often featured floral appliqu\u00e9 framing the star design. Star quilts have become an important part of many [[Plains Indians |Plains Indian]] ceremonies, replacing buffalo robes traditionally given away at births, marriages, tribal elections, and other ceremonies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Murphy |first1=Mary |title=Montana Quilts and Quiltmakers: A History of Work and Beauty |journal=Montana The Magazine of Western History |date=Autumn 2008 |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=39\u201340 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/25485734 |accessdate=22 February 2020}}</ref> Pictorial quilts, created with appliqu\u00e9, were also common.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAnother distinctive style of Native American quilting is [[Seminole]] piecing, created by Seminoles living in the [[Everglades|Florida Everglades]]. The style evolved out a need for cloth (the closest town was often a week's journey away). Women would make strips  of sewing the remnants of fabric rolls together, then sew these into larger pieces to make clothing. Eventually the style began to be used not just for clothing but for quilts as well. In 1900, with the introduction of sewing machines and readily available fabric in Seminole communities, the patterns became much more elaborate and the style continues to be in use today, both by Seminole women and by others who have copied and adapted their designs and techniques.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Hawaiian quilting====\n\"[[Hawaiian quilt]]ing was well established by the beginning of the twentieth century. Hawaiian women learned to quilt from the wives of missionaries from New England in the 1820s. Though they learned both pieced work and applique, by the 1870s they had adapted applique techniques to create a uniquely Hawaiian mode of expression. The classic Hawaiian quilt design is a large, bold, curvilinear appliqu\u00e9 pattern that covers much of the surface of the quilt, with the symmetrical design cut from only one piece of fabric.\"<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Quilts|year=2003|title=The Encyclopedia of American Folk Art|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/routfolkart/quilts|ISBN=978-0203644485|publisher=Florence Taylor and Francis |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan }}</ref>\n\n=== South Asian quilting ===\nThere are two primary forms of quilting that originate in [[South Asia]]: [[Nakshi kantha|Nakshi Kantha]] and [[Ralli quilt|Ralli]]. Nakshi Kantha quilts originated in India and are typically made of scraps and worn-out fabric stitched together with old sari threads using [[kantha]] embroidery stitches. \"The layers of cloth were spread on the ground, held in place with weights at the edges, and sewn together with rows of large basting stitches. The cloth was then folded and worked on whenever there was time.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> The first recorded kantha are more than 500 years old.\n\nRalli quilts are traditionally made in [[Pakistan]], western [[India]], and the surrounding area. They are made by every sector of society including [[Hindu]] and [[Muslim]] women, women of different castes, and women from different towns or villages or tribes with the colors and designs  varying among these groups. The name comes from ''ralanna'', a word meaning to mix or connect. Quilts tops were designed and pieced by one woman using scraps of hand-dyed cotton. This cotton often comes from old dresses or shawls. Once pieced, the quilt top is placed on a reed mat with the other layers and sewn together using thick, colored thread in straight parallel lines by members of the designer's family and community.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Swedish quilting ===\nQuilting originated in [[Sweden]] in the fifteenth century with heavily stitched and appliqu\u00e9d quilts made for the very wealthy. These quilts, created from silk, wool, and felt, were intended to be both decorative and functional and were found in churches and in the homes of nobility. Imported cotton first appeared in Sweden in 1870, and began to appear in Swedish quilts soon after along with scraps of wool, silk, and linen. As the availability of cotton increased and its price went down, quilting became widespread among all classes of Swedish society. Wealthier quilters used wool batting while others used linen scraps, rags, or paper mixed with animal hair. In general, these quilts were simple and narrow,  made by both men and women. The biggest influence on Swedish quilting in this time period is thought to have come from America as Swedish immigrants to the United States returned to their home country when conditions there improved.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Art quilting===\nDuring the late 20th century, [[art quilts]] became popular for their aesthetic and artistic qualities rather than for functionality as they are displayed on a wall or table rather than being used on a bed.. \"It is believed that decorative quilting came to Europe and Asia during the Crusades (A.D. 1100\u20131300), a likely idea because textile arts were more developed in China and India than in the West.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Bial|first=Raymond|title=With Needle and Thread|url=https://archive.org/details/withneedlethread0000bial|url-access=registration|year=1996|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|location=Boston; New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/withneedlethread0000bial/page/18 18]}}</ref>\n\n=== Modern quilting ===\nIn the early 21st century, modern quilting became a more prominent area of quilting.

As industrial sewing technology has become more precise and flexible, quilting using exotic fabrics and embroidery began to appear in home furnishings in the early 21st century.\n\n===Quilt blocks===\nThe quilt block is traditionally a sub-unit composed of several pieces of fabric sewn together. The quilt blocks are repeated, or sometimes alternated with plain blocks, to form the overall design of a quilt. Barbara Brackman has documented over 4000 different quilt block patterns from the early 1830s to the 1970s in the ''Encyclopedia Of Pieced Quilt Patterns''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Pieced Quilt Patterns|last=Brackman|first=Barbara|publisher=American Quilter's Society|year=1993|isbn=978-0891458159|location=Paducah, KY|pages=552}}</ref> Some of the simpler designs for quilt blocks include the Nine-Patch, Shoo Fly, Churn Dash, and the Prairie Queen.\n\nMost geometric quilt block designs fit into a \"grid,\" the number of squares a pattern block is divided into. The five categories into which most square patterns fall are Four Patch, Nine Patch, Five-Patch, Seven-Patch, and Eight-Pointed Star. Each block can be subdivided into multiples: a Four-Patch can be constructed of 16 or 64 squares, for example.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Patchwork Patterns|last=Beyer|first=Jinny|publisher=EPM Publications Inc.|year=1979|isbn=0-914440-27-6|location=McLean, VA|pages=8\u20139}}</ref> \n\nA simple Nine Patch is made by sewing five patterned or dark pieces (patches) to four light square pieces in alternating order. These nine sewn squares make one block.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The New Quick & Easy Block Tool!|last=|first=|publisher=C&T Publishing|year=2016|isbn=978-1-61745-231-4|location=Concord, CA|pages=83}}</ref>\n\nThe Shoo Fly varies from this Nine Patch by dividing each of the four corner pieces into a light and dark triangle.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The New Quick & Easy Block Tool!|last=|first=|publisher=C&T Publishing|year=2016|isbn=978-1-61745-231-4|location=Concord, CA|pages=95}}</ref>\n\nAnother variation develops when one square piece is divided into two equal rectangles in the basic Nine Patch design. The Churn Dash block combines the triangles and rectangle to expand the Nine Patch.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The New Quick & Easy Block Tool!|last=|first=|publisher=C&T Publishing|year=2016|isbn=978-1-61745-231-4|location=Concord, CA|pages=34}}</ref>\n\nThe Prairie Queen block combines two large scale triangles in the corner section with the middle section using four squares. The center piece is one full size square. Each of the nine sections does have the same overall measurement and fits together.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe number of patterns possible by subdividing Four-, Five-, Seven-, Nine-Patches and Eight-Pointed Stars and using triangles instead of squares in the small subdivisions is almost endless.\n\n==Types and equipment==\nMany types of quilting exist today. The two most widely used are hand-quilting and machine quilting.\n\n'''Hand quilting''' is the process of using a [[Sewing needle|needle]] and [[yarn|thread]] to sew a [[running stitch]] by hand across the entire area to be quilted. This binds the layers together. A quilting frame or hoop is often used to assist in holding the piece being quilted off the quilter's lap. A quilter can make one stitch at a time by first driving the needle through the fabric from the right side, then pushing it back up through the material from the wrong side to complete the stitch; this is called a stab stitch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barbrobson.com/journal/2011/7/1/stab-stitch-quilting.html|title=Stab Stitch Quilting|work=Barbara Robson}}</ref> Another option is called a rocking stitch, where the quilter has one hand, usually with a finger wearing a [[thimble]], on top of the quilt, while the other hand is located beneath the piece to push the needle back up.<ref>{{Cite book|title = All Things Quilting with Alex Anderson|last = Anderson|first = Alex|publisher = C&T Publishing|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-60705-856-4|location = Concord, CA|pages = 132}}</ref> A third option is called \"loading the needle\" and involves doing four or more stitches before pulling the needle through the cloth. Hand quilting is still practiced by the Amish and Mennonites within the United States and Canada, and is enjoying a resurgence worldwide.\n[[File:Quilting machine in Haikou.webm|thumb|Quilting machine in [[Haikou]], Hainan, China]]\n'''Machine quilting''' is the process of using a home [[sewing machine]] or a longarm machine to sew the layers together. With the home sewing machine, the layers are tacked together before quilting. This involves laying the top, batting, and backing out on a flat surface and either pinning (using large safety pins) or [[tack (sewing)|tacking]] the layers together.<ref>{{Cite book|title = All Things Quilting with Alex Anderson|last = Anderson|first = Alex|publisher = C&T Publishing|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-60705-856-4|location = Concord, CA|pages = 129\u2013130}}</ref> [[Longarm quilting]] involves placing the layers to be quilted on a special frame. The frame has bars on which the layers are rolled, keeping these together without the need for tacking or pinning. These frames are used with a professional sewing machine mounted on a platform. The platform rides along tracks so that the machine can be moved across the layers on the frame. A longarm machine is moved across the fabric. In contrast, the fabric is moved through a home sewing machine.\n\n'''Tying''' is another technique of fastening the three layers together. This is done primarily on quilts that are made to be used and are needed quickly. The process of <!-- dead link: http://www.nmia.com/~mgdesign/qor/begin/tying.htm--> tying the quilt is done with [[yarn]]s or multiple strands of [[thread (yarn)|thread]]. [[Reef knot|Square knot]]s are used to finish off the ties so that the quilt may be washed and used without fear of the knots coming undone.<ref>{{Cite book|title = All Things Quilting with Alex Anderson|last = Anderson|first = Alex|publisher = C&T Publishing|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-60705-856-4|location = Concord, CA|pages = 154}}</ref> This technique is commonly called \"tacking.\"  In the Midwest, tacked bed covers are referred to as comforters.\n\nQuilting is now taught in some American schools.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cehs.unl.edu/tmfd/ma-textile-historyquilt-studies-distance-learning-option-iii/|title=MA \u2013 Textile History/Quilt Studies Distance Learning Option III {{!}} College of Education and Human Sciences|website=cehs.unl.edu|access-date=2019-06-16}}</ref><!--which DT? a mystery to non-Americans \u2013 ch: is this any better?--> It is also taught at senior centers around the U.S., but quilters of all ages attend classes. These forms of workshop or classes are also available in other countries in guilds and community colleges.\n\nContemporary quilters use a  wide range of quilting designs and styles, from ancient and ethnic to post-modern futuristic patterns. There is no one single school or style that dominates the quilt-making world. Regardless of skill level, all quilters know the importance of having the right tools when quilting. Having the right tools increases the fluid process of making a quilt and can even be improved over time with practice. Having the right tools will maximize efficiency and make the quilting experience one to remember. Below is a list of the different tools and tips that can be used to make a quilt by hand or machine:<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.Quilting101.com|title=Quilting 101 \u2013 Quilt making tips and resources|publisher=Quilting|accessdate=28 January 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web|last=Cox|first=Meg|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles|work=The Wall Street Journal|title='Modern Quilters' Stress Simplicity, Edgy Subjects|date=May 9, 2013|accessdate=28 January 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Sewing machine]]\n\nA good quality sewing machine is a helpful addition to the process of piecing together a quilt top. Some also use a home sewing machine for quilting together the layers of the quilt, as well as binding the final product. While almost all home sewing machines can be used to quilt layers together, having a wide [https://janome.com.au/what-makes-a-quilting-machine-different-from-a-sewing-machine/ throat], the space to the right of the needle mechanism, is very helpful because it is easier to manipulate a bulky quilt through the machine when the throat is both high and long. It is important to understand how your particular model functions in order to select the correct settings, thread the needle and bobbin, and operate the machine. [https://aquietrefuge.com/sewing-machine-noise-reduction/ Here is a handy guide on using a machine.]\n*Fabric Markers or Ruler\nWhen making a quilt it is important to mark the fabric that you are cutting in order to have some kind of guidance when cutting the fabric, or you could use a quilting ruler and rotary cutter. When marking the fabric it is advised that you use a fabric marker, which is a marker that washes out when the quilt is washed or will fade away after repeated washes.<ref name=\"auto1\" />\n[[File:Quilting Studio 005.jpg|thumb|Longarm quilting machine]]\n*[[Longarm quilting]] Machines\nThe longarm quilting machine makes it easier to make larger quilts because of the extended arm that is used. Being able to leverage the larger machine and not having to hold the material that is being used while quilting helps the process move along much faster and makes it easier on the quilter.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Some quilt shops offer longarm services, where one can pay for their project to be quilted and in some cases, bound as well. \n*Machine Quilting Needles\n\nWhen quilting, one of the most important tools that is used is the [[Sewing needle|needle]]. Whether you are quilting by hand or by machine, the needle that is being used is critical to the final result. Using the wrong needle can lead to puckering, bumps, or even the material being torn. Machine quilting needs a sharp needle to easily pierce the three part quilt sandwich and properly sew together the quilt top, batting and backing.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>  \n\n* Hand Quilting Needles\n\nThe traditional needles used for quilting are called ''betweens'' and are generally smaller and stronger than normal sewing needles. They have a very small eye which prevents any extra bump at the head of the needles when you are pulling though the thread.<ref name=\"auto1\" /> \n\n*Pins and Thimbles\nUnderstanding how [[pin]]s and [[thimble]]s work is also very important in the process of making quilts. Many different combinations of pinning can be used in order get similar results and the exciting part is figuring out existing combinations as well as coming up with new ones. Thimbles are not required but are good for keeping fingers safe.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> \n*Threads\nChoosing the right types of threads for a quilt can be difficult and beginners may need some assistance from an expert or more advanced quilter. The color, composition, and type of thread that is used will have a pivotal role in the outcome of the final quilt.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> \n*Rotary Cutters and Boards\nWhat a quilter uses to cut the fabric is a vital step in the quilting process. It is very important each piece is perfectly aligned in order to prevent an uneven or sloppy appearance and to prevent rework. Rotary cutters revolutionized quiltmaking when they appeared in the late 1970s. A rotary cutter offers even the shakiest of hands the ability to produce perfect, even slices and minimizes the chance of error.<ref>{{Cite book|title = All Things Quilting with Alex Anderson|last = Anderson|first = Alex|publisher = C&T Publishing|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-60705-856-4|location = Concord, CA|page = 36}}</ref>\n*Quilting Templates/Patterns\nQuilts can have many different templates or patterns and they can have a large impact on the final result. There are a number of mediums that can be used and depending on the usage, size, and style they will give your quilt a varied look. Templates are generally considered the basis of the structure of the quilt, like a blueprint for a house. If used properly it can help quilters produce a quilt of their liking and give them a sense of satisfaction and vision for future quilts they want to make.<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n== Specialty styles ==\n*[[Foundation piecing]] \u2013 also known as paper-piecing \u2013 sewing pieces of fabric onto a temporary or permanent foundation\n* [[Shadow quilting|Shadow]] or [[echo quilting]] \u2013 Hawaiian quilting, where quilting is done around an appliqu\u00e9d piece on the quilt top, then the quilting is echoed again and again around the previous quilting line.\n*[[Ralli quilting]] \u2013 Pakistani and Indian quilting, often associated with the Sindh (Pakistan) and Gujarat (India) regions.\n*[[Sashiko stitching]] \u2013 Basic running stitch worked in heavy, white cotton thread usually on dark indigo colored fabric.

Examples include [[Kokborok]] in [[Tripura]] and [[Mizo language|Mizo]] in [[Mizoram]].\n\n=== Legislature and administration ===\nThe constitutional provisions in relation to use of the official language in legislation at the [[States and union territories of India|State level]] largely mirror those relating to the official language at the central level, with minor variations. State legislatures may conduct their business in their [[official language]], Hindi or (for a transitional period, which the legislature can extend if it so chooses) English, and members who cannot use any of these have the same rights to their [[mother tongue]] with the Speaker's permission. The authoritative text of all laws must be in English, unless Parliament passes a law permitting a state to use another language, and if the original text of a law is in a different language, an authoritative English translation of all laws must be prepared.\n\nThe state has the right to regulate the use of its official language in [[public administration]], and in general, neither the constitution nor any central enactment imposes any restriction on this right. However, every person submitting a [[petition]] for the redress of a grievance to an officer or authority of the state government has a constitutional right to submit it in any language used in that state, regardless of its official status.\n\nIn addition, the constitution grants the central government, acting through the [[President of India|President]], the power to issue certain directives to the government of a state in relation to the use of [[minority language]]s for official purposes. The President may direct a State to officially recognise a language spoken in its territory for specified purposes and in specified regions, if its speakers demand it and satisfy him that a substantial proportion of the State's population desire its use. Similarly, States and local authorities are required to endeavour to provide [[primary education]] in the mother tongue for all [[linguistic minority|linguistic minorities]], regardless of whether their language is official in that State, and the President has the power to issue directions he deems necessary to ensure that they are provided these facilities.\n\n=== State judiciary ===\nStates have significantly less freedom in relation to determine the language in which judicial proceedings in their respective [[High Courts of India|High Courts]] will be conducted. The constitution gives the power to authorise the use of Hindi, or the state's official language in proceedings of the High Court to the [[Governors and Lieutenant-Governors of states of India|Governor]], rather than the state legislature, and requires the Governor to obtain the consent of the [[President of India]], who in these matters acts on the advice of the [[Government of India]]. The Official Languages Act gives the Governor a similar power, subject to similar conditions, in relation to the language in which the High Court's judgments will be delivered.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | title=The Official Languages (Use for Official Purpose of the Union) \u2013 Rules 1976 (As Amended, 1987) \u2013 Section 7 | accessdate=10 June 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325173337/http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | archive-date=25 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nFour states\u2014[[Bihar]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Rajasthan]]\u2014<ref>[http://www.barandbench.com/index.php?title=Language%20in%20Courts%20-%20a%20bridge%20or%20a%20barrier?&page=brief&id=805&gn=0 Language in Courts \u2013 a bridge or a barrier?]</ref> have been granted the right to conduct proceedings in their High Courts in their official language, which, for all of them, was Hindi.

The use of English in parliamentary proceedings was to be phased out at the end of fifteen years unless Parliament chose to extend its use, which Parliament did through the Official Languages Act, 1963.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | title=The Official Languages (Use for Official Purpose of the Union) \u2013 Rules 1976 (As Amended, 1987) \u2013 Paragraph 3(1b) | accessdate=10 June 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325173337/http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | archive-date=25 March 2010}}</ref> In addition, the constitution permits a person who is unable to express themselves in either [[Hindi]] or [[English language|English]] to, with the permission of the [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the relevant House, address the House in their [[mother tongue]].<ref>Article [http://www.constitution.org/cons/india/p05120.html 120(1) first proviso].</ref>\n\nIn contrast, the constitution requires the authoritative text of all laws, including Parliamentary [[enactment (British legal term)|enactments]] and [[statutory instruments]], to be in English, until Parliament decides otherwise. Parliament has not exercised its power to so decide, instead merely requiring that all such laws and instruments, and all [[Bill (proposed law)|bills]] brought before it, also be translated into Hindi, though the English text remains authoritative.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | title=The Official Languages (Use for Official Purpose of the Union) \u2013 Rules 1976 (As Amended, 1987) \u2013 Paragraph 5(1,2) | accessdate=10 June 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325173337/http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | archive-date=25 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Judiciary ===\nThe constitution provides, and the [[Supreme Court of India]] has reiterated, that all proceedings in the Supreme Court (the country's highest [[court]]) and the High Courts shall be in [[English language|English]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/court-language-is-english-says-supreme-court/articleshow/50080870.cms|title=Court language is English, says Supreme Court \u2013 The Economic Times|work=The Economic Times|access-date=30 May 2017}}</ref> Parliament has the power to alter this by law, but has not done so.

[[Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha]] headquartered at [[Chennai]] was formed to spread Hindi in [[South India|South Indian states]]. Regional Hindi implementation offices at [[Bangalore|Bengaluru]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Mumbai]], [[Kolkata]], [[Guwahati]], [[Bhopal]], [[Delhi]] and [[Ghaziabad, India|Ghaziabad]] have been established to monitor the implementation of Hindi in Central government offices and PSUs.\n\nAnnual targets are set by the Department of Official Language regarding the amount of correspondence being carried out in Hindi. A Parliament Committee on Official Language constituted in 1976 periodically reviews the progress in the use of Hindi and submits a report to the President. The governmental body which makes policy decisions and established guidelines for promotion of Hindi is the ''Kendriya Hindi Samiti'' (est. 1967). In every city that has more than ten central Government offices, a Town Official Language Implementation Committee is established and cash awards are given to government employees who write books in Hindi. All Central government offices and PSUs are to establish Hindi Cells for implementation of Hindi in their offices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Official Language \u2013 Constitutional/Statutory Provisions |url=http://india.gov.in/knowindia/official_language.php |work=[[Government of India]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070417150059/http://india.gov.in/knowindia/official_language.php |archivedate=17 April 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, the government announced plans to promote Hindi in government offices in [[South India|Southern]] and [[Northeast India]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/centre-to-promote-use-of-hindi-in-south-india-northeast-jitendra-singh/|title=Centre to promote use of Hindi in South India, Northeast:<br/>In response to this several NGO and political parties have started agitation and some have even re-sorted to violent protests in the Darjeeling for separate statehood, which started in after the official statement in press meet by Central parliamentary affairs minister.

Examples include [[Kokborok]] in [[Tripura]] and [[Mizo language|Mizo]] in [[Mizoram]].\n\n=== Legislature and administration ===\nThe constitutional provisions in relation to use of the official language in legislation at the [[States and union territories of India|State level]] largely mirror those relating to the official language at the central level, with minor variations. State legislatures may conduct their business in their [[official language]], Hindi or (for a transitional period, which the legislature can extend if it so chooses) English, and members who cannot use any of these have the same rights to their [[mother tongue]] with the Speaker's permission. The authoritative text of all laws must be in English, unless Parliament passes a law permitting a state to use another language, and if the original text of a law is in a different language, an authoritative English translation of all laws must be prepared.\n\nThe state has the right to regulate the use of its official language in [[public administration]], and in general, neither the constitution nor any central enactment imposes any restriction on this right. However, every person submitting a [[petition]] for the redress of a grievance to an officer or authority of the state government has a constitutional right to submit it in any language used in that state, regardless of its official status.\n\nIn addition, the constitution grants the central government, acting through the [[President of India|President]], the power to issue certain directives to the government of a state in relation to the use of [[minority language]]s for official purposes. The President may direct a State to officially recognise a language spoken in its territory for specified purposes and in specified regions, if its speakers demand it and satisfy him that a substantial proportion of the State's population desire its use. Similarly, States and local authorities are required to endeavour to provide [[primary education]] in the mother tongue for all [[linguistic minority|linguistic minorities]], regardless of whether their language is official in that State, and the President has the power to issue directions he deems necessary to ensure that they are provided these facilities.\n\n=== State judiciary ===\nStates have significantly less freedom in relation to determine the language in which judicial proceedings in their respective [[High Courts of India|High Courts]] will be conducted. The constitution gives the power to authorise the use of Hindi, or the state's official language in proceedings of the High Court to the [[Governors and Lieutenant-Governors of states of India|Governor]], rather than the state legislature, and requires the Governor to obtain the consent of the [[President of India]], who in these matters acts on the advice of the [[Government of India]]. The Official Languages Act gives the Governor a similar power, subject to similar conditions, in relation to the language in which the High Court's judgments will be delivered.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | title=The Official Languages (Use for Official Purpose of the Union) \u2013 Rules 1976 (As Amended, 1987) \u2013 Section 7 | accessdate=10 June 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325173337/http://www.rajbhasha.gov.in/dolruleseng.htm | archive-date=25 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nFour states\u2014[[Bihar]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Rajasthan]]\u2014<ref>[http://www.barandbench.com/index.php?title=Language%20in%20Courts%20-%20a%20bridge%20or%20a%20barrier?&page=brief&id=805&gn=0 Language in Courts \u2013 a bridge or a barrier?]</ref> have been granted the right to conduct proceedings in their High Courts in their official language, which, for all of them, was Hindi.
