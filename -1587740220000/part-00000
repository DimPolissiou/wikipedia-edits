It was written and directed by series creator [[Joss Whedon]], and first broadcast on September 29, 1998.\n\n== Plot ==\nUnder her middle name, \"Anne\", Buffy works as a diner waitress in L.A. She serves Lily and Rickie, a young couple living on the streets, who have just gotten a complementary set of distinctive tattoos. Later that evening Lily approaches Buffy and reveals that she remembers her from [[Lie to Me (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|an earlier episode]], when Lily was known as \"Chanterelle\". As they talk, a man wanders into the street and is nearly hit by a car, only saved by Buffy's quick response. Buffy runs into a man named Ken, who comments on her \"lost\" state and offers to befriend her.\n\nThe next day Lily tells Buffy that Rickie has disappeared. Buffy reluctantly agrees to help find him. In her search, she finds the body of an elderly homeless man with Rickie's tattoo. Buffy reports her findings to Lily, who doesn't believe that the body could be Rickie's. On the street Lily meets Ken, who claims to know Rickie, so she eagerly goes with him. Buffy interrogates a blood bank worker who has been acting suspiciously, and learns that the woman has been giving Ken the names of healthy homeless people who come in to donate blood.\n\nMeanwhile, Ken has prepared Lily for a \"cleansing,\" which entails stepping into a bath in the floor. Lily hesitates, as the bath looks like black oil. At the door, Buffy attempts to pass herself off as a sinner wanting a new chance, but ends up kicking her way into the building in time to see Lily dragged into the pool. Buffy and Ken wrestle and they both fall in, coming out below in a huge factory. Ken's human mask falls off, revealing him to be a demon. Buffy and Lily are now amongst many other slave laborers of varying ages. Ken tells Buffy and Lily that they are in a hell dimension where time passes very quickly: a hundred years there equals only one day in Los Angeles. Since he only picks people who no one will miss, they will have worked themselves to a used-up death of old age without anyone noticing their absence. He tells Lily that Rickie remembered her, even after he had forgotten his own name. Lily resigns herself to ending up in hell, and accepts her fate passively.\n\nKen lines the captives up and each one is asked, \"Who are you?\" and then bludgeoned unless they answer \"I'm no one.\" When it is Buffy's turn, she says her name with pride and a battle ensues until Ken threatens Lily at knifepoint. Ken delivers a speech, but Lily pushes him off the ledge onto a concrete floor. Lily then leads the captives back up through the pool as Buffy dispatches Ken.

It was written and directed by series creator [[Joss Whedon]], and first broadcast on September 29, 1998.\n\n== Plot ==\nUnder her middle name, \"Anne\", Buffy works as a diner waitress in L.A. She serves Lily and Rickie, a young couple living on the streets, who have just gotten a complementary set of distinctive tattoos. Later that evening Lily approaches Buffy and reveals that she remembers her from [[Lie to Me (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|an earlier episode]], when Lily was known as \"Chanterelle\". As they talk, a man wanders into the street and is nearly hit by a car, only saved by Buffy's quick response. Buffy runs into a man named Ken, who comments on her \"lost\" state and offers to befriend her.\n\nThe next day Lily tells Buffy that Rickie has disappeared. Buffy reluctantly agrees to help find him. In her search, she finds the body of an elderly homeless man with Rickie's tattoo. Buffy reports her findings to Lily, who doesn't believe that the body could be Rickie's. On the street Lily meets Ken, who claims to know Rickie, so she eagerly goes with him. Buffy interrogates a blood bank worker who has been acting suspiciously, and learns that the woman has been giving Ken the names of healthy homeless people who come in to donate blood.\n\nMeanwhile, Ken has prepared Lily for a \"cleansing,\" which entails stepping into a bath in the floor. Lily hesitates, as the bath looks like black oil. At the door, Buffy attempts to pass herself off as a sinner wanting a new chance, but ends up kicking her way into the building in time to see Lily dragged into the pool. Buffy and Ken wrestle and they both fall in, coming out below in a huge factory. Ken's human mask falls off, revealing him to be a demon. Buffy and Lily are now amongst many other slave laborers of varying ages. Ken tells Buffy and Lily that they are in a hell dimension where time passes very quickly: a hundred years there equals only one day in Los Angeles. Since he only picks people who no one will miss, they will have worked themselves to a used-up death of old age without anyone noticing their absence. He tells Lily that Rickie remembered her, even after he had forgotten his own name. Lily resigns herself to ending up in hell, and accepts her fate passively.\n\nKen lines the captives up and each one is asked, \"Who are you?\" and then bludgeoned unless they answer \"I'm no one.\" When it is Buffy's turn, she says her name with pride and a battle ensues until Ken threatens Lily at knifepoint. Ken delivers a speech, but Lily pushes him off the ledge onto a concrete floor. Lily then leads the captives back up through the pool as Buffy dispatches Ken. Once all of the humans are out of the demonic dimension, the pool gateway closes.\n\nBack in her apartment, Buffy packs her bag, ready to return to Sunnydale. She gives Lily her \"Anne\" identity. The episode ends with Buffy being embraced by her relieved mother.\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=July 2019}}\nNoel Murray of ''[[The A.V.

My son was hired two months ago by WWE creative, and will begin working with the company in January. He would have started earlier, but he and I both felt it was important for him to fulfill the commitment he made to the college that employed him as the director of a residence hall. He could have merely explained that this was his dream job, and possibly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but he chose to stay because it was the right thing \u2013 and because I told him that deep down, Mr. McMahon would respect him as a man of his word. My son was not given this job because of his last name. He earned it. He earned it by working for hundreds of hours in solitude, with no compensation, to prove his writing skills and mind for the business. There are no piece-of-cake jobs in WWE. As ESPN's Jonathan Coachman said of his time with WWE, \"you are expected to bring it every day.\" My son will do his best to \"bring it\" every day.

My son was hired two months ago by WWE creative, and will begin working with the company in January. He would have started earlier, but he and I both felt it was important for him to fulfill the commitment he made to the college that employed him as the director of a residence hall. He could have merely explained that this was his dream job, and possibly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but he chose to stay because it was the right thing \u2013 and because I told him that deep down, Mr. McMahon would respect him as a man of his word. My son was not given this job because of his last name. He earned it. He earned it by working for hundreds of hours in solitude, with no compensation, to prove his writing skills and mind for the business. There are no piece-of-cake jobs in WWE. As ESPN's Jonathan Coachman said of his time with WWE, \"you are expected to bring it every day.\" My son will do his best to \"bring it\" every day.

[[Mark Antony]] tells [[Lucius Vorenus|Vorenus]] that if no resistance is met and they encounter no civilians, he is to take the proclamation and nail it to the door of the [[Curia Julia|Senate house]].  Caesar is curious as to why Vorenus is so morose and asks Antony.  Antony reveals that [[Lucius Vorenus|Vorenus]] is a strict [[Cato the Younger|Catonian]] and believes what Caesar is doing is a \"terrible sacrilege\" to which Caesar responds that he is only seeking his legitimate right.\n\nMeanwhile, in Rome, a man enters [[Lucius Vorenus|Vorenus]]' home as Niobe is preparing food and walks straight to the baby's crib, telling Niobe that he just wants to see his son.  Niobe tells him to leave but as he makes to do so, he turns back to face Niobe to try to persuade her to love him again.  She resists for a moment but slowly starts to give in, but just as the two are about to exchange a kiss, Vorena the Elder enters the door and interrupts them.  Niobe quickly makes the man leave.  Vorena believes that if Niobe were to tell Vorenus the truth about the baby and that she thought he was dead, Vorenus would forgive her and everything would be fine, but Niobe knows full well that if [[Lucius Vorenus|Vorenus]] were to learn the truth, he would then have the [[Lex Iulia de Adulteriis Coercendis|legal]] right and moral obligation to kill her and his children.\n\nAs the scouting mission camps for the night, [[Lucius Vorenus|Vorenus]] asks [[Titus Pullo|Pullo]] for advice on how to get Niobe to love him again since he's been away at war in Gaul for eight years and knows virtually nothing about women.  [[Titus Pullo|Pullo]], being the self declared consummate authority on women, jumps at the chance to tell Vorenus everything he knows.\n\nBack in Rome, [[Pompey]], [[Cicero]], [[Cato the Younger|Cato]] and [[Metellus Scipio|Scipio]] all discuss options as they receive word of Caesar's advancement only being thirty miles from the city. Though they have four legions in Rome, they are either untrained conscripts (a unit of which is wiped out by Vorenus's scouts) or are veterans of the [[Gallic Wars]] whose loyalty can't be counted upon. They decide a tactical retreat to [[Corfinium]] is the best plan of action so that they can rally their legions and retake the city when all is ready.\n\nAs [[Atia of the Julii|Atia]] is holding a dinner with [[Servilia (mother of Marcus Junius Brutus)|Servilia]] and [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]] in a show of unity, Pompeian supporters outside the house begin to cause a small riot and beat on the doors with a small battering ram while shouting insults through the open atrium ceiling.\n\nMeanwhile, Pompey and his family are making final preparations for their retreat from the city, during which Cornelia reminds Pompey of the treasury gold, who in turn tells his man Durio that he and a small detachment of men must go to the Capitoline vaults, which are only to be touched in cases of extreme peril, and get as much of the gold as they can.  The task complete, the detachment begins to make their way from the city, but when Durio tells the driver that he's going the wrong way from the [[Appian Way|Appian]] gate, the man tells him they're not going to the Appian gate and proceeds to stab Durio and throw him from the ox cart.  Later, as the soldiers with the stolen gold are making their way from the city, we are introduced to [[Eirene (Rome character)|Eirene]].  She is walking down the road as the soldiers are passing and before she knows it, a legionary unceremoniously whisks her up onto the back of his horse, to inevitably become his slave.\n\n[[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]] and [[Servilia (mother of Marcus Junius Brutus)|Servilia]] discuss their predicament.  Brutus knows that if he stays in the city because of his friendship with Caesar, he effectively declares for Caesar and rebellion.  If he leaves with the Senate, he declares for them and the preservation of the Republic.  Ultimately, he decides to go with Pompey and the Senate because of his family's history with the politics of Rome (his ancestors drove out the last [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus|Etruscan]] king).  Servilia, on the other hand, is of a different mind.  She wants to stay in Rome to be there when Caesar returns in order to rekindle their romance.\n\nBack on the road to Rome, [[Lucius Vorenus|Vorenus]] and [[Titus Pullo|Pullo]], still unable to figure out why they're meeting no resistance, cross paths with the soldiers and the stolen treasury gold, along with Eirene being led along tied to the wagon by her bound wrists.  The soldiers explain that the lack of resistance is because Pompey and the Senate have left the city, thereby permitting [[Lucius Vorenus|Vorenus]] and the scouting party to proceed without caution.  When [[Lucius Vorenus|Vorenus]] questions the lead man about the cart, he's told that it's just a grain wagon. But when [[Lucius Vorenus|Vorenus]] points out that they're all wearing soldiers' sandals and that soldiers would have no business guarding a grain wagon, a fight ensues and all the men but the driver, who has taken refuge in the woods, are driven off and killed while Eirene remains tied to the wagon.\n\nWhile Atia holds court for [[plebs|plebeians]] seeking the support of the Julii, [[Lucius Vorenus|Vorenus]], Pullo and the scouting party finally enter Rome and make their way to the [[Roman Forum|Forum]], where [[Lucius Vorenus|Vorenus]] nails Caesar's proclamation to the Senate door.  He then heads to his home telling [[Titus Pullo|Pullo]] that he's done what was asked of him and he will sin no more.  [[Titus Pullo|Pullo]], on the other hand, still intrigued with Eirene, goes back to find the wagon.  When he locates it, he finds Eirene lying on the ground with her wrists still bound to the wagon.  Upon discovering she is still alive, he unties her and sets her up in the wagon before he checks to see what exactly is in it.  He opens one box, takes one look and shuts it quickly, breathing heavily.  He looks in the next box with the same reaction.  Then he pulls back the covering to see exactly how many boxes are in the wagon and gasps at, what he thinks is, his newfound wealth.  As he's surmising the situation, he hears the trumpets of Caesar's army approaching and quickly makes a getaway before they arrive.\n\n==Historical and cultural background==\nIn this episode, Atia is seen to be \"holding court\"; obviously wealthy\u2014but presumably [[Plebs|plebeian]]\u2014people coming to her, as Caesar's Legion approaches. This practice was a custom of the Roman nobility known as ''[[Patronage in ancient Rome|clientela]]''. It seems likely that wealthy [[plebs]] would seek the \"protection\" of the Julii clan as \"clients\" ''(clientes)'' with [[Atia of the Julii|Atia]] as their ''patrona'', and thus protect themselves from the \"ravages of the Legions\" should Caesar actually [[looting|sack]] [[Rome]]. Of course, this would not happen, but they could not know this. It is quite clear that [[Atia of the Julii|Atia]] is not above extorting people for her dubious \"protection\", demanding 5,000 [[Denarius|denarii]].\n\n==Episode characters==\n\n===Main cast===\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n| width=\"33%\" |[[Lucius Vorenus (Rome character)|Lucius Vorenus]]\n| width=\"33%\" |[[Titus Pullo (Rome character)|Titus Pullo]]\n| width=\"33%\" |[[Atia of the Julii]]\n|-\n|  [[Gnaeus Pompey Magnus (Rome character)|Pompey Magnus]]\n|  [[Cato the Younger (Rome character)|Porcius Cato]]\n|  [[Gaius Octavian (Rome character)|Gaius Octavian]]\n|-\n|}\n\n===Guest stars===\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n| width=\"33%\" | Appius<br>played by [[Andrea Bruschi]]\n| width=\"33%\" | Arena Hackler<br>played by [[Cesare Cremonini (actor)|Cesare Cremonini]]\n| width=\"33%\" | Daughter of Pompey<br>played by [[Eliza Darby]]\n|-\n| Clarissa<br>played by [[Anna Francolini]]\n| Appius<br>played by [[Andrew Greenough]]\n| Gaius Julius Caesar<br>played by [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]]\n|-\n| Eirene<br>played by [[Chiara Mastalli]]\n| Durio<br>played by [[Matt Patresi]]\n| Cornelia<br>played by [[Anna Patrick]]\n|-\n| Mark Antony<br>played by [[James Purefoy]]\n| Glabius<br>played by [[Roberto Purvis]]\n| Legionary #1<br>played by [[Gabriele Ragusa]]\n|-\n| Numa<br>played by [[Stuart M.

''Visionary Women'' (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fotress, 2002), p. 7.</ref>\n\n===Spirituality===\nFrom early childhood, long before she undertook her public mission or even her monastic vows, Hildegard's spiritual awareness was grounded in what she called the umbra viventis lucis, the reflection of the living Light. Her letter to [[Guibert of Gembloux]], which she wrote at the age of seventy- seven, describes her experience of this light with admirable precision:\n\n\"From my early childhood, before my bones, nerves and veins were fully strengthened, I have always seen this vision in my soul, even to the present time when I am more than seventy years old. In this vision my soul, as God would have it, rises up high into the vault of heaven and into the changing sky and spreads itself out among different peoples, although they are far away from me in distant lands and places. And because I see them this way in my soul, I observe them in accord with the shifting of clouds and other created things. I do not hear them with my outward ears, nor do I perceive them by the thoughts of my own heart or by any combination of my five senses, but in my soul alone, while my outward eyes are open. So I have never fallen prey to ecstasy in the visions, but I see them wide awake, day and night. And I am constantly fettered by sickness, and often in the grip of pain so intense that it threatens to kill me, but God has sustained me until now. The light which I see thus is not spatial, but it is far, far brighter than a cloud which carries the sun. I can measure neither height, nor length, nor breadth in it; and I call it \"the reflection of the living Light.\" And as the sun, the moon, and the stars appear in water, so writings, sermons, virtues, and certain human actions take form for me and gleam.\"<ref>Newman, Barbara. \"Hildegard of Bingen: Visions and Validation.\" ''Church History'' 54, no. 2 (1985): 163-75.</ref>\n\n===Monastic life===\nPerhaps because of Hildegard's visions, or as a method of political positioning (or both), Hildegard's parents offered her as an [[oblate]] to the [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] monastery at the [[Disibodenberg]], which had been recently reformed in the [[Palatinate Forest]]. The date of Hildegard's enclosure at the monastery is the subject of debate. Her ''[[Hagiography|Vita]]'' says she was professed with an older woman, [[Jutta von Sponheim|Jutta]], the daughter of Count [[Stephen II, Count of Sponheim|Stephan II of Sponheim]], at the age of eight.<ref>''Jutta & Hildegard: The Biographical Sources'', trans. Anna Silvas (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), p. 139.</ref> However, Jutta's date of enclosure is known to have been in 1112, when Hildegard would have been fourteen.<ref>''Jutta & Hildegard: The Biographical Sources'', trans. Anna Silvas (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), pp. 52\u201355, 69; and John Van Engen, \"Abbess: 'Mother and Teacher', in Barbara Newman, ed., ''Voice of the Living Light'' (California: University of California Press, 1998), pp. 30\u201351, at pp. 32\u201333.</ref> Their vows were received by Bishop [[Otto of Bamberg|Otto Bamberg]] on All Saints' Day, 1112. Some scholars speculate that Hildegard was placed in the care of Jutta at the age of eight, and the two women were then enclosed together six years later.<ref>Michael McGrade, \"Hildegard von Bingen\", in ''Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart: allgemeine Enzyklopaldie der Musik,'' 2nd edition, T.2, Vol. 8, ed. Ludwig Fischer (Kassel and New York: Bahrenreiter, 1994).</ref>\n\nIn any case, Hildegard and Jutta were enclosed together at the [[Disibodenberg]], and formed the core of a growing community of women attached to the male monastery. Jutta was also a visionary and thus attracted many followers who came to visit her at the cloister. Hildegard tells us that Jutta taught her to read and write, but that she was unlearned and therefore incapable of teaching Hildegard sound biblical interpretation.<ref>Ruether, Rosemary Radford. ''Visionary Women'' (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fotress, 2002), p. 6.</ref> The written record of the ''Life of Jutta'' indicates that Hildegard probably assisted her in reciting the psalms, working in the garden and other handiwork, and tending to the sick.<ref>''Jutta & Hildegard: The Biographical Sources'', trans. Anna Silvas (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), pp. 70\u201373; Reed-Jones, Carol. ''Hildegard of Bingen: Women of Vision'' (Washington: Paper Crane Press, 2004), p. 8.</ref> This might have been a time when Hildegard learned how to play the ten-stringed [[psaltery]]. [[Volmar (monk)|Volmar]], a frequent visitor, may have taught Hildegard simple psalm notation. The time she studied music could have been the beginning of the compositions she would later create.<ref>Reed-Jones, Carol. ''Hildegard of Bingen: Women of Vision'' (Washington: Paper Crane Press, 2004), p. 6.</ref>\n\nUpon Jutta's death in 1136, Hildegard was unanimously elected as ''magistra'' of the community by her fellow nuns.<ref>Furlong, Monica. ''Visions and Longings: Medieval Women Mystics'' (Massachusetts: Shambhala Publications, 1996), p. 84.</ref> Abbot Kuno of Disibodenberg asked Hildegard to be [[Prioress]], which would be under his authority. Hildegard, however, wanted more independence for herself and her nuns, and asked Abbot Kuno to allow them to move to [[Rupertsberg]].<ref>Furlong, Monica. ''Visions and Longings: Medieval Women Mystics'' (Massachusetts: Shambhala Publications, 1996), p. 85.</ref> This was to be a move towards poverty, from a stone complex that was well established to a temporary dwelling place. When the abbot declined Hildegard's proposition, Hildegard went over his head and received the approval of [[Archbishop Henry I of Mainz]]. Abbot Kuno did not relent until Hildegard was stricken by an illness that kept her paralyzed and unable to move from her bed, an event that she attributed to God's unhappiness at her not following his orders to move her nuns to a new location in Rupertsberg. It was only when the Abbot himself could not move Hildegard that he decided to grant the nuns their own monastery.<ref>McGrade, \"Hildegard\", ''MGG''.</ref> Hildegard and about twenty nuns thus moved to the St. Rupertsberg monastery in 1150, where [[Volmar (monk)|Volmar]] served as provost, as well as Hildegard's confessor and scribe. In 1165 Hildegard founded a second monastery for her nuns at [[Eibingen Abbey|Eibingen]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wam.rutgers.edu/profiles/hildegard-of-bingen-an-interview-with-dr-margot-fassler/|title=Women in art and music|website=rutgers.edu|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref>\n\nBefore Hildegard's death, a problem arose with the clergy of Mainz. A man buried in Rupertsburg had died after excommunication from the Church. Therefore, the clergy wanted to remove his body from the sacred ground. Hildegard did not accept this idea, replying that it was a sin and that the man had been reconciled to the church at the time of his death.<ref>Flanagan, Sabina.

''Mystics of the Church'' (Pennsylvania: Morehouse Publishing, 1925), p. 77.</ref> She used the term 'visio' (the Latin for \"vision\") to describe this feature of her experience and recognized that it was a gift that she could not explain to others. Hildegard explained that she saw all things in the light of God through the five senses: sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch.<ref>Schipperges, Heinrich. ''Hildegard of Bingen: Healing and the Nature of the Cosmos'' (New Jersey: Markus Wiener Publishers, 1997), p. 10.</ref> Hildegard was hesitant to share her visions, confiding only to [[Jutta von Sponheim|Jutta]], who in turn told Volmar, Hildegard's tutor and, later, secretary.<ref>Maddocks, Fiona. ''Hildegard of Bingen: The Woman of Her Age'' (New York: Doubleday, 2001), p. 55.</ref> Throughout her life, she continued to have many visions, and in 1141, at the age of 42, Hildegard received a vision she believed to be an instruction from God, to \"write down that which you see and hear.\"<ref>Ruether, Rosemary Radford. ''Visionary Women'' (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fotress, 2002), p. 8.</ref> Still hesitant to record her visions, Hildegard became physically ill. The illustrations recorded in the book of Scivias were visions that Hildegard experienced, causing her great suffering and tribulations.<ref>Underhill, Evelyn. ''Mystics of the Church'' (Pennsylvania: Morehouse Publishing, 1925), pp. 78\u201379.</ref> In her first theological text, ''[[Scivias]]'' (\"Know the Ways\"), Hildegard describes her struggle within:\n\n<blockquote>But I, though I saw and heard these things, refused to write for a long time through doubt and bad opinion and the diversity of human words, not with stubbornness but in the exercise of humility, until, laid low by the scourge of God, I fell upon a bed of sickness; then, compelled at last by many illnesses, and by the witness of a certain noble maiden of good conduct [the nun Richardis von Stade] and of that man whom I had secretly sought and found, as mentioned above, I set my hand to the writing. While I was doing it, I sensed, as I mentioned before, the deep profundity of scriptural exposition; and, raising myself from illness by the strength I received, I brought this work to a close \u2013 though just barely \u2013 in ten years. (...) And I spoke and wrote these things not by the invention of my heart or that of any other person, but as by the secret mysteries of God I heard and received them in the heavenly places. And again I heard a voice from Heaven saying to me, 'Cry out, therefore, and write thus!'<ref>Hildegard von Bingen, ''Scivias'', trans. by Columba Hart and Jane Bishop with an Introduction by Barbara J. Newman, and Preface by Caroline Walker Bynum (New York: Paulist Press, 1990), pp. 60\u201361.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIt was between November 1147 and February 1148 at the synod in Trier that [[Pope Eugene III|Pope Eugenius]] heard about Hildegard's writings. It was from this that she received Papal approval to document her visions as revelations from the Holy Spirit, giving her instant credence.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Oliveira, Plinio Correa de. \"St. Hildegard Von Bingen, 17 September\".

In these volumes, the last of which was completed when she was well into her seventies, Hildegard first describes each vision, whose details are often strange and enigmatic, and then interprets their theological contents in the words of the \"voice of the Living Light.\"{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n====''Scivias''====\n[[File:Meister des Hildegardis-Codex 004.jpg|thumb|left|The Church, the Bride of Christ and Mother of the Faithful in Baptism.

''Scivias'' is a contraction of ''Sci vias Domini'' (''Know the Ways of the Lord''), and it was Hildegard's first major visionary work, and one of the biggest milestones in her life.

Mother Columba Hart and Jane Bishop (Paulist Press, 1990), pp. 59\u201361.</ref> Hildegard began to record and interpret her visionary experiences. In total, 26 visionary experiences were captured in this compilation.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n''[[Scivias]]'' is structured into three parts of unequal length. The first part (six visions) chronicles the order of God's creation: the Creation and Fall of Adam and Eve, the structure of the universe (famously described as the shape of an \"egg\"), the relationship between body and soul, God's relationship to his people through the Synagogue, and the choirs of angels. The second part (seven visions) describes the order of redemption: the coming of Christ the Redeemer, the [[Trinity]], the Church as the Bride of Christ and the Mother of the Faithful in [[baptism]] and [[confirmation]], the orders of the Church, Christ's sacrifice on the Cross and the [[Eucharist]], and the fight against the devil. Finally, the third part (thirteen visions) recapitulates the history of salvation told in the first two parts, symbolized as a building adorned with various allegorical figures and virtues. It concludes with the Symphony of Heaven, an early version of Hildegard's musical compositions.<ref>SCIVIAS.</ref>\n\nIn early 1148, a commission was sent by the Pope to Disibodenberg to find out more about Hildegard and her writings. The commission found that the visions were authentic and returned to the Pope, with a portion of the ''Scivias''. Portions of the uncompleted work were read aloud to [[Pope Eugenius III]] at the Synod of Trier in 1148, after which he sent Hildegard a letter with his blessing.<ref>Letter 4 in ''The Letters of Hildegard of Bingen'', trans.

She had already explored this area in her musical morality play, ''Ordo Virtutum'', and the \"Book of the Rewards of Life\" takes up that play's characteristic themes. Each vice, although ultimately depicted as ugly and grotesque, nevertheless offers alluring, seductive speeches that attempt to entice the unwary soul into their clutches. Standing in our defence, however, are the sober voices of the Virtues, powerfully confronting every vicious deception.<ref>Hildegard of Bingen. ''The Book of the Rewards of Life''. Trans. Bruce W.

Lucca, MS 1942, early 13th-century copy.]]\nHildegard's last and grandest visionary work had its genesis in one of the few times she experienced something like an ecstatic loss of consciousness. As she described it in an autobiographical passage included in her Vita, sometime in about 1163, she received \"an extraordinary mystical vision\" in which was revealed the \"sprinkling drops of sweet rain\" that [[John the Evangelist]] experienced when he wrote, \"In the beginning was the Word...\" (John 1:1). Hildegard perceived that this Word was the key to the \"Work of God\", of which humankind is the pinnacle. The ''Book of Divine Works'', therefore, became in many ways an extended explication of the Prologue to John's Gospel.<ref>\"The Life of Hildegard\", II.16, in ''Jutta & Hildegard: The Biographical Sources'', trans. Anna Silvas (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), 179; Dronke, Peter. ''Women Writers of the Middle Ages'' (Cambridge University Press, 1984), pp. 162\u201363.</ref>\n\nThe ten visions of this work's three parts are cosmic in scale, to illustrate various ways of understanding the relationship between God and his creation. Often, that relationship is established by grand allegorical female figures representing Divine Love (''Caritas'') or Wisdom (''Sapientia''). The first vision opens the work with a salvo of poetic and visionary images, swirling about to characterize God's dynamic activity within the scope of his work within the history of salvation. The remaining three visions of the first part introduce the famous image of a human being standing astride the spheres that make up the universe and detail the intricate relationships between the human as microcosm and the universe as macrocosm. This culminates in the final chapter of Part One, Vision Four with Hildegard's commentary on the Prologue to John's Gospel (John 1:1\u201314), a direct rumination on the meaning of \"In the beginning was the Word...\" The single vision that constitutes the whole of Part Two stretches that rumination back to the opening of Genesis, and forms an extended commentary on the seven days of the creation of the world told in Genesis 1\u20132:3. This commentary interprets each day of creation in three ways: literal or cosmological; allegorical or ecclesiological (i.e. related to the Church's history); and moral or tropological (i.e. related to the soul's growth in virtue). Finally, the five visions of the third part take up again the building imagery of ''Scivias'' to describe the course of salvation history. The final vision (3.5) contains Hildegard's longest and most detailed prophetic program of the life of the Church from her own days of \"womanish weakness\" through to the coming and ultimate downfall of the Antichrist.<ref>St. Hildegard of Bingen, [https://www.hfsbooks.com/catalog/title/?isbn=978-0813231297 ''The Book of Divine Works''], trans.

In addition to the ''[[Ordo Virtutum]],'' sixty-nine musical compositions, each with its own original poetic text, survive, and at least four other texts are known, though their musical notation has been lost.<ref>Hildegard of Bingen. ''Symphonia'', ed. Barbara Newman (2nd Ed.; Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1988, 1998).</ref> This is one of the largest repertoires among medieval composers.\n\n{{Listen|filename=O frondens 2.ogg|title=''O frondens virga''|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nOne of her better-known works, ''Ordo Virtutum'' (''Play of the Virtues''), is a [[morality play]]. It is uncertain when some of Hildegard's compositions were composed, though the ''Ordo Virtutum'' is thought to have been composed as early as 1151.<ref>Flanagan, Sabina. ''Hildegard of Bingen, 1098\u20131179: A Visionary Life'' (London: Routledge, 1989), p. 102.</ref> It is an independent Latin morality play with music (82 songs); it does not supplement or pay homage to the Mass or the Office of a certain feast. The most significant part of this entire composition is, however, that the ''Ordo virtutum'' is the earliest known surviving musical drama that is not attached to a liturgy.<ref name=\"Burkholder, J. Peter 2006\"/>\n\nThis entertainment was both performed and bemused by a select community of noblewomen and nuns. Even more fascinating about this piece, the devil has no music whatsoever in the plot of the play, he instead shouts and bellows all his lines. All other characters sing in monophonic plainchant. This includes Patriarchs, Prophets, A Happy Soul, A Unhappy Soul and A Penitent Soul along with 16 female Virtues (including Mercy, Innocence, Chasity, Obedience, Hope, and Faith).{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe ''Ordo virtutum'' was probably performed as a manifestation of the theology Hildegard delineated in the ''Scivias''. The play serves as a group enchantment of the Christian story of sin, confession, repentance, and forgiveness. Notably, it is the female Virtues who restore the fallen to the community of the faithful, not the male Patriarchs or Prophets. This would have been a significant message to the nuns in Hildegard's convent. Scholars assert that the role of the Devil would have been played by Volmar, while Hildegard's nuns would have played the parts of Anima (the human souls) and the Virtues.<ref>Audrey Ekdahl Davidson. \"Music and Performance: Hildegard of Bingen's Ordo Virtutum.\" ''The Ordo Virtutum of Hildegard of Bingen: Critical Studies'', (Kalamazoo, MI: Western Michigan University, 1992), pp. 1\u201329.</ref>\n\nIn addition to the ''Ordo Virtutum'', Hildegard composed many liturgical songs that were collected into a cycle called the ''Symphonia armoniae celestium revelationum''. The songs from the Symphonia are set to Hildegard's own text and range from antiphons, hymns, and sequences, to responsories.<ref>Maddocks, Fiona.

''Voice of the Living Light'' (California: University of California Press, 1998), p. 150.</ref> Its style is characterized by soaring melodies that can push the boundaries of the more staid ranges of traditional Gregorian chant. Though Hildegard's music is often thought to stand outside the normal practices of monophonic monastic chant,<ref name=\"holsinger\"/> current researchers are also exploring ways in which it may be viewed in comparison with her contemporaries, such as [[Hermannus Contractus]].<ref>See Jennifer Bain, \"Hildegard, Hermannus and Late Chant Style,\" ''Journal of Music Theory'', 2008, vol. 52.</ref> Another feature of Hildegard's music that both reflects twelfth-century evolutions of chant and pushes those evolutions further is that it is highly [[melismatic]], often with recurrent melodic units. Scholars such as [[Margot Fassler]], Marianne Richert Pfau, and Beverly Lomer also note the intimate relationship between music and text in Hildegard's compositions, whose rhetorical features are often more distinct than is common in twelfth-century chant.<ref>Margot Fassler. \"Composer and Dramatist: 'Melodious Singing and the Freshness of Remorse,'\" ''Voice of the Living Light: Hildegard of Bingen and Her World'', ed.

Neither claim to be rooted in her visionary experience and its divine authority. Rather, they spring from her experience helping in and then leading the monastery's herbal garden and infirmary, as well as the theoretical information she likely gained through her wide-ranging reading in the monastery's library.<ref name=Glaze>Florence Eliza Glaze, \"Medical Writer: 'Behold the Human Creature,'\" in ''Voice of the Living Light: Hildegard of Bingen and Her World'', ed.

''Hildegard's Healing Plants: From Her Medieval Classic Physica'' (Massachusetts: Beacon Press, 2001), pp. xi\u2013xii</ref> In addition to her hands-on experience, she also gained medical knowledge, including elements of her humoral theory, from traditional Latin texts.<ref name=Sweet/>\n\nHildegard catalogued both her theory and practice in two works. The first, ''Physica,'' contains nine books that describe the scientific and medicinal properties of various plants, stones, fish, reptiles, and animals. This document is also thought to contain the first recorded reference of the usage of hops in beer as a preservative.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kitsock |first1=Greg |title=Hops: The beer ingredient (most) drinkers love |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/hops-the-beer-ingredient-most-drinkers-love/2014/02/10/fd5daab0-8f57-11e3-84e1-27626c5ef5fb_story.html |website=The Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Oliver |first1=Garrett |title=The Oxford Companion to Beer |date=9 September 2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=435}}</ref> The second, ''Causae et Curae'', is an exploration of the people's bodies living or dead, its connections to the rest of the natural world, and the causes and cures of various diseases.<ref name=\"medical\">Hildegard von Bingen, ''Causae et Curae (Holistic Healing)'', trans. by Manfred Pawlik and Patrick Madigan, ed. by Mary Palmquist and John Kulas (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, Inc., 1994); Hildegard von Bingen, ''Physica'', trans. Priscilla Throop (Rochester, Vermont: Healing Arts Press, 1998).</ref> Hildegard documented various medical practices in these books, including the use of bleeding and home remedies for many common ailments. She also explains remedies for common agricultural injuries such as burns, fractures, dislocations, and cuts.<ref name=Sweet/> Hildegard may have used the books to teach assistants at the monastery. These books are historically significant because they show areas of medieval medicine that were not well documented because their practitioners (mainly women) rarely wrote in Latin. Her writings were commentated on by [[M\u00e9lanie Lipinska]], a Polish scientist.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Old Time Makers of Medicine|last=Walsh|first=James|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=1911|location=New York|pages=194\u2013201}}.</ref>\n\nIn addition to its wealth of practical evidence, ''Causae et Curae'' is also noteworthy for its organizational scheme. Its first part sets the work within the context of the creation of the cosmos and then humanity as its summit, and the constant interplay of the human person as microcosm both physically and spiritually with the macrocosm of the universe informs all of Hildegard's approach.<ref name=Glaze/> Her hallmark is to emphasize the vital connection between the \"green\" health of the natural world and the holistic health of the human person. ''Viriditas'', or greening power, was thought to sustain human beings and could be manipulated by adjusting the balance of elements within a person.<ref name=\"Sweet\" /> Thus, when she approached medicine as a type of gardening, it was not just as an analogy. Rather, Hildegard understood the plants and elements of the garden as direct counterparts to the humors and elements within the human body, whose imbalance led to illness and disease.<ref name=Sweet/>\n\nThus, the nearly three hundred chapters of the second book of ''Causae et Curae'' \"explore the etiology, or causes, of disease as well as human sexuality, psychology, and physiology.\"<ref name=Glaze/> In this section, she gives specific instructions for bleeding based on various factors, including gender, the phase of the moon (bleeding is best done when the moon is waning), the place of disease (use veins near diseased organ or body part) or prevention (big veins in arms), and how much blood to take (described in imprecise measurements, like \"the amount that a thirsty person can swallow in one gulp\"). She even includes bleeding instructions for animals to keep them healthy. In the third and fourth sections, Hildegard describes treatments for malignant and minor problems and diseases according to the humoral theory, again including information on animal health. The fifth section is about diagnosis and prognosis, which includes instructions to check the patient's blood, pulse, urine and stool.<ref name=Sweet/> Finally, the sixth section documents a lunar horoscope to provide an additional means of prognosis for both disease and other medical conditions, such as conception and the outcome of pregnancy.<ref name=Glaze/> For example, she indicates that a waxing moon is good for human conception and is also good for sowing seeds for plants (sowing seeds is the plant equivalent of conception).<ref name=Sweet/> Elsewhere, Hildegard is even said to have stressed the value of boiling drinking water in an attempt to prevent infection.<ref name=encyclopedia>\"Hildegard of Bingen.\" Encyclopedia of World Biography. 2004.</ref>\n\nAs Hildegard elaborates the medical and scientific relationship between the human microcosm and the macrocosm of the universe, she often focuses on interrelated patterns of four: \"the four elements (fire, air, water, and earth), the four seasons, the four humors, the four zones of the earth, and the four major winds.\"<ref name=Glaze/> Although she inherited the basic framework of [[humorism|humoral theory]] from ancient medicine, Hildegard's conception of the hierarchical inter-balance of the four humors (blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile) was unique, based on their correspondence to \"superior\" and \"inferior\" elements\u2014blood and phlegm corresponding to the \"celestial\" elements of fire and air, and the two biles corresponding to the \"terrestrial\" elements of water and earth. Hildegard understood the disease-causing imbalance of these humors to result from the improper dominance of the subordinate humors. This disharmony reflects that introduced by Adam and Eve in the Fall, which for Hildegard marked the indelible entrance of disease and humoral imbalance into humankind.<ref name=Glaze/> As she writes in ''Causae et Curae'' c. 42:\n\n<blockquote>It happens that certain men suffer diverse illnesses. This comes from the phlegm which is superabundant within them. For if man had remained in paradise, he would not have had the ''flegmata'' within his body, from which many evils proceed, but his flesh would have been whole and without dark humor [''livor'']. However, because he consented to evil and relinquished good, he was made into a likeness of the earth, which produces good and useful herbs, as well as bad and useless ones, and which has in itself both good and evil moistures. From tasting evil, the blood of the sons of Adam was turned into the poison of semen, out of which the sons of man are begotten. And therefore their flesh is ulcerated and permeable [to disease]. These sores and openings create a certain storm and smoky moisture in men, from which the ''flegmata'' arise and coagulate, which then introduce diverse infirmities to the human body. All this arose from the first evil, which man began at the start, because if Adam had remained in paradise, he would have had the sweetest health, and the best dwelling-place, just as the strongest balsam emits the best odor; but on the contrary, man now has within himself poison and phlegm and diverse illnesses.<ref>Quoted in Glaze, \"Medical Writer: 'Behold the Human Creature,'\" p. 136.</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== ''Lingua ignota'' and ''Litterae ignotae'' ===\n[[File:Litterae ignotae.png|thumb|right|Alphabet by Hildegard von Bingen, Litterae ignotae, which she used for her language [[Lingua Ignota]]]]\n\nHildegard also invented an [[constructed script|alternative alphabet]].

The acceptance of public preaching by a woman, even a well-connected abbess and acknowledged prophet, does not fit the stereotype of this time. Her preaching was not limited to the monasteries; she preached publicly in 1160 in Germany. (New York: Routledge, 2001, 9). She conducted four preaching tours throughout Germany, speaking to both clergy and laity in chapter houses and in public, mainly denouncing clerical corruption and calling for reform.<ref>Ruether, Rosemary Radford. Visionary Women. Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress, 2002. pp. 28\u201329.</ref>\n\nMany abbots and abbesses asked her for prayers and opinions on various matters.<ref name=\"Bennett, Judith M 2001\"/> She traveled widely during her four preaching tours.<ref>Furlong, Monica.

Hildegard also influenced several monastic women, exchanging letters with [[Elizabeth of Sch\u00f6nau|Elisabeth of Sch\u00f6nau]], a nearby visionary.<ref>Hildegard von Bingen, ''The Letters of Hildegard of Bingen'', trans. by Joseph L.

Ehrman (NY: Oxford University Press, 1994/1998), p. 180.</ref>\n\nHildegard corresponded with popes such as [[Pope Eugene III|Eugene III]] and [[Anastasius IV]], statesmen such as [[Abbot Suger]], German emperors such as [[Frederick I Barbarossa]], and other notable figures such as Saint [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], who advanced her work, at the behest of her abbot, Kuno, at the [[Synod of Trier]] in 1147 and 1148. Hildegard of Bingen's correspondence is an important component of her literary output.<ref>Schipperges, Heinrich.

Her name was nonetheless taken up in the [[Roman Martyrology]] at the end of the 16th century. Her [[feast day]] is 17 September.

Bowers (Selinsgrove: Susquehanna University Press, 1993), pp. 44\u201353.</ref> They note her reference to herself as a member of the weaker sex and her rather constant belittling of women. Hildegard frequently referred to herself as an unlearned woman, completely incapable of Biblical exegesis.<ref>Ruether, Rosemary Radford. Visionary Women (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fotress, 2002), pp. 10\u201311.</ref> Such a statement on her part, however, worked to her advantage because it made her statements that all of her writings and music came from visions of the Divine more believable, therefore giving Hildegard the authority to speak in a time and place where few women were permitted a voice.<ref>Barbara Newman, \"Hildegard of Bingen: Visions and Validation,\" ''Church History'' 54 (1985): pp. 163\u201375; Barbara Newman, ''Sister of Wisdom: St. Hildegard's Theology of the Feminine'', (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1987).</ref> Hildegard used her voice to amplify the Church's condemnation of institutional corruption, in particular [[simony]].\n\nHildegard has also become a figure of reverence within the contemporary [[New Age movement]], mostly because of her holistic and natural view of healing, as well as her status as a mystic. Though her medical writings were long neglected, and then studied without reference to their context,<ref name=Sweet4>Sweet, V. (1999). \"Hildegard of Bingen and the greening of medieval medicine.\" ''Bulletin of the history of Medicine'', 73(3), p. 386.</ref> she was the inspiration for Dr. Gottfried Hertzka's \"Hildegard-Medicine\", and is the namesake for June Boyce-Tillman's Hildegard Network, a healing center that focuses on a holistic approach to wellness and brings together people interested in exploring the links between spirituality, the arts, and healing.<ref>June Boyce-Tillman, \"Hildegard of Bingen at 900: The Eye of a Woman,\" ''The Musical Times'' 139, no. 1865 (Winter, 1998): p. 35.</ref> Her reputation as a medicinal writer and healer was also used by early feminists to argue for women's rights to attend medical schools.<ref name=Sweet4/> Hildegard's reincarnation has been debated since 1924 when Austrian mystic [[Rudolf Steiner]] lectured that a nun of her description was the past life of Russian poet-philosopher [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Soloviev]],<ref>Steiner, Rudolf.

Her letter to [[Guibert of Gembloux]], which she wrote at the age of seventy- seven, describes her experience of this light with admirable precision:\n\n\"From my early childhood, before my bones, nerves and veins were fully strengthened, I have always seen this vision in my soul, even to the present time when I am more than seventy years old. In this vision my soul, as God would have it, rises up high into the vault of heaven and into the changing sky and spreads itself out among different peoples, although they are far away from me in distant lands and places. And because I see them this way in my soul, I observe them in accord with the shifting of clouds and other created things. I do not hear them with my outward ears, nor do I perceive them by the thoughts of my own heart or by any combination of my five senses, but in my soul alone, while my outward eyes are open. So I have never fallen prey to ecstasy in the visions, but I see them wide awake, day and night. And I am constantly fettered by sickness, and often in the grip of pain so intense that it threatens to kill me, but God has sustained me until now. The light which I see thus is not spatial, but it is far, far brighter than a cloud which carries the sun. I can measure neither height, nor length, nor breadth in it; and I call it \"the reflection of the living Light.\" And as the sun, the moon, and the stars appear in water, so writings, sermons, virtues, and certain human actions take form for me and gleam.\"<ref>Newman, Barbara. \"Hildegard of Bingen: Visions and Validation.\" ''Church History'' 54, no. 2 (1985): 163-75.</ref>\n\n===Monastic life===\nPerhaps because of Hildegard's visions, or as a method of political positioning (or both), Hildegard's parents offered her as an [[oblate]] to the [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] monastery at the [[Disibodenberg]], which had been recently reformed in the [[Palatinate Forest]]. The date of Hildegard's enclosure at the monastery is the subject of debate. Her ''[[Hagiography|Vita]]'' says she was professed with an older woman, [[Jutta von Sponheim|Jutta]], the daughter of Count [[Stephen II, Count of Sponheim|Stephan II of Sponheim]], at the age of eight.<ref>''Jutta & Hildegard: The Biographical Sources'', trans. Anna Silvas (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), p. 139.</ref> However, Jutta's date of enclosure is known to have been in 1112, when Hildegard would have been fourteen.<ref>''Jutta & Hildegard: The Biographical Sources'', trans.

Jutta was also a visionary and thus attracted many followers who came to visit her at the cloister. Hildegard tells us that Jutta taught her to read and write, but that she was unlearned and therefore incapable of teaching Hildegard sound biblical interpretation.<ref>Ruether, Rosemary Radford. ''Visionary Women'' (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fotress, 2002), p. 6.</ref> The written record of the ''Life of Jutta'' indicates that Hildegard probably assisted her in reciting the psalms, working in the garden and other handiwork, and tending to the sick.<ref>''Jutta & Hildegard: The Biographical Sources'', trans.

''Visions and Longings: Medieval Women Mystics'' (Massachusetts: Shambhala Publications, 1996), p. 85.</ref> This was to be a move towards poverty, from a stone complex that was well established to a temporary dwelling place. When the abbot declined Hildegard's proposition, Hildegard went over his head and received the approval of [[Archbishop Henry I of Mainz]]. Abbot Kuno did not relent until Hildegard was stricken by an illness that kept her paralyzed and unable to move from her bed, an event that she attributed to God's unhappiness at her not following his orders to move her nuns to a new location in Rupertsberg. It was only when the Abbot himself could not move Hildegard that he decided to grant the nuns their own monastery.<ref>McGrade, \"Hildegard\", ''MGG''.</ref> Hildegard and about twenty nuns thus moved to the St. Rupertsberg monastery in 1150, where [[Volmar (monk)|Volmar]] served as provost, as well as Hildegard's confessor and scribe. In 1165 Hildegard founded a second monastery for her nuns at [[Eibingen Abbey|Eibingen]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wam.rutgers.edu/profiles/hildegard-of-bingen-an-interview-with-dr-margot-fassler/|title=Women in art and music|website=rutgers.edu|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref>\n\nBefore Hildegard's death, a problem arose with the clergy of Mainz. A man buried in Rupertsburg had died after excommunication from the Church. Therefore, the clergy wanted to remove his body from the sacred ground.

While I was doing it, I sensed, as I mentioned before, the deep profundity of scriptural exposition; and, raising myself from illness by the strength I received, I brought this work to a close \u2013 though just barely \u2013 in ten years. (...) And I spoke and wrote these things not by the invention of my heart or that of any other person, but as by the secret mysteries of God I heard and received them in the heavenly places.

''Scivias'' is a contraction of ''Sci vias Domini'' (''Know the Ways of the Lord''), and it was Hildegard's first major visionary work, and one of the biggest milestones in her life.

In total, 26 visionary experiences were captured in this compilation.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n''[[Scivias]]'' is structured into three parts of unequal length. The first part (six visions) chronicles the order of God's creation: the Creation and Fall of Adam and Eve, the structure of the universe (famously described as the shape of an \"egg\"), the relationship between body and soul, God's relationship to his people through the Synagogue, and the choirs of angels. The second part (seven visions) describes the order of redemption: the coming of Christ the Redeemer, the [[Trinity]], the Church as the Bride of Christ and the Mother of the Faithful in [[baptism]] and [[confirmation]], the orders of the Church, Christ's sacrifice on the Cross and the [[Eucharist]], and the fight against the devil. Finally, the third part (thirteen visions) recapitulates the history of salvation told in the first two parts, symbolized as a building adorned with various allegorical figures and virtues. It concludes with the Symphony of Heaven, an early version of Hildegard's musical compositions.<ref>SCIVIAS.</ref>\n\nIn early 1148, a commission was sent by the Pope to Disibodenberg to find out more about Hildegard and her writings. The commission found that the visions were authentic and returned to the Pope, with a portion of the ''Scivias''.

She had already explored this area in her musical morality play, ''Ordo Virtutum'', and the \"Book of the Rewards of Life\" takes up that play's characteristic themes. Each vice, although ultimately depicted as ugly and grotesque, nevertheless offers alluring, seductive speeches that attempt to entice the unwary soul into their clutches.

Lucca, MS 1942, early 13th-century copy.]]\nHildegard's last and grandest visionary work had its genesis in one of the few times she experienced something like an ecstatic loss of consciousness. As she described it in an autobiographical passage included in her Vita, sometime in about 1163, she received \"an extraordinary mystical vision\" in which was revealed the \"sprinkling drops of sweet rain\" that [[John the Evangelist]] experienced when he wrote, \"In the beginning was the Word...\" (John 1:1). Hildegard perceived that this Word was the key to the \"Work of God\", of which humankind is the pinnacle. The ''Book of Divine Works'', therefore, became in many ways an extended explication of the Prologue to John's Gospel.<ref>\"The Life of Hildegard\", II.16, in ''Jutta & Hildegard: The Biographical Sources'', trans. Anna Silvas (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), 179; Dronke, Peter. ''Women Writers of the Middle Ages'' (Cambridge University Press, 1984), pp. 162\u201363.</ref>\n\nThe ten visions of this work's three parts are cosmic in scale, to illustrate various ways of understanding the relationship between God and his creation. Often, that relationship is established by grand allegorical female figures representing Divine Love (''Caritas'') or Wisdom (''Sapientia''). The first vision opens the work with a salvo of poetic and visionary images, swirling about to characterize God's dynamic activity within the scope of his work within the history of salvation. The remaining three visions of the first part introduce the famous image of a human being standing astride the spheres that make up the universe and detail the intricate relationships between the human as microcosm and the universe as macrocosm. This culminates in the final chapter of Part One, Vision Four with Hildegard's commentary on the Prologue to John's Gospel (John 1:1\u201314), a direct rumination on the meaning of \"In the beginning was the Word...\" The single vision that constitutes the whole of Part Two stretches that rumination back to the opening of Genesis, and forms an extended commentary on the seven days of the creation of the world told in Genesis 1\u20132:3. This commentary interprets each day of creation in three ways: literal or cosmological; allegorical or ecclesiological (i.e. related to the Church's history); and moral or tropological (i.e. related to the soul's growth in virtue). Finally, the five visions of the third part take up again the building imagery of ''Scivias'' to describe the course of salvation history. The final vision (3.5) contains Hildegard's longest and most detailed prophetic program of the life of the Church from her own days of \"womanish weakness\" through to the coming and ultimate downfall of the Antichrist.<ref>St. Hildegard of Bingen, [https://www.hfsbooks.com/catalog/title/?isbn=978-0813231297 ''The Book of Divine Works''], trans.

In addition to the ''[[Ordo Virtutum]],'' sixty-nine musical compositions, each with its own original poetic text, survive, and at least four other texts are known, though their musical notation has been lost.<ref>Hildegard of Bingen. ''Symphonia'', ed. Barbara Newman (2nd Ed.; Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1988, 1998).</ref> This is one of the largest repertoires among medieval composers.\n\n{{Listen|filename=O frondens 2.ogg|title=''O frondens virga''|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nOne of her better-known works, ''Ordo Virtutum'' (''Play of the Virtues''), is a [[morality play]]. It is uncertain when some of Hildegard's compositions were composed, though the ''Ordo Virtutum'' is thought to have been composed as early as 1151.<ref>Flanagan, Sabina. ''Hildegard of Bingen, 1098\u20131179: A Visionary Life'' (London: Routledge, 1989), p. 102.</ref> It is an independent Latin morality play with music (82 songs); it does not supplement or pay homage to the Mass or the Office of a certain feast. The most significant part of this entire composition is, however, that the ''Ordo virtutum'' is the earliest known surviving musical drama that is not attached to a liturgy.<ref name=\"Burkholder, J. Peter 2006\"/>\n\nThis entertainment was both performed and bemused by a select community of noblewomen and nuns. Even more fascinating about this piece, the devil has no music whatsoever in the plot of the play, he instead shouts and bellows all his lines. All other characters sing in monophonic plainchant. This includes Patriarchs, Prophets, A Happy Soul, A Unhappy Soul and A Penitent Soul along with 16 female Virtues (including Mercy, Innocence, Chasity, Obedience, Hope, and Faith).{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe ''Ordo virtutum'' was probably performed as a manifestation of the theology Hildegard delineated in the ''Scivias''. The play serves as a group enchantment of the Christian story of sin, confession, repentance, and forgiveness. Notably, it is the female Virtues who restore the fallen to the community of the faithful, not the male Patriarchs or Prophets. This would have been a significant message to the nuns in Hildegard's convent. Scholars assert that the role of the Devil would have been played by Volmar, while Hildegard's nuns would have played the parts of Anima (the human souls) and the Virtues.<ref>Audrey Ekdahl Davidson. \"Music and Performance: Hildegard of Bingen's Ordo Virtutum.\" ''The Ordo Virtutum of Hildegard of Bingen: Critical Studies'', (Kalamazoo, MI: Western Michigan University, 1992), pp. 1\u201329.</ref>\n\nIn addition to the ''Ordo Virtutum'', Hildegard composed many liturgical songs that were collected into a cycle called the ''Symphonia armoniae celestium revelationum''. The songs from the Symphonia are set to Hildegard's own text and range from antiphons, hymns, and sequences, to responsories.<ref>Maddocks, Fiona.

''Voice of the Living Light'' (California: University of California Press, 1998), p. 150.</ref> Its style is characterized by soaring melodies that can push the boundaries of the more staid ranges of traditional Gregorian chant.

Scholars such as [[Margot Fassler]], Marianne Richert Pfau, and Beverly Lomer also note the intimate relationship between music and text in Hildegard's compositions, whose rhetorical features are often more distinct than is common in twelfth-century chant.<ref>Margot Fassler. \"Composer and Dramatist: 'Melodious Singing and the Freshness of Remorse,'\" ''Voice of the Living Light: Hildegard of Bingen and Her World'', ed.

Neither claim to be rooted in her visionary experience and its divine authority. Rather, they spring from her experience helping in and then leading the monastery's herbal garden and infirmary, as well as the theoretical information she likely gained through her wide-ranging reading in the monastery's library.<ref name=Glaze>Florence Eliza Glaze, \"Medical Writer: 'Behold the Human Creature,'\" in ''Voice of the Living Light: Hildegard of Bingen and Her World'', ed.

''Hildegard's Healing Plants: From Her Medieval Classic Physica'' (Massachusetts: Beacon Press, 2001), pp. xi\u2013xii</ref> In addition to her hands-on experience, she also gained medical knowledge, including elements of her humoral theory, from traditional Latin texts.<ref name=Sweet/>\n\nHildegard catalogued both her theory and practice in two works. The first, ''Physica,'' contains nine books that describe the scientific and medicinal properties of various plants, stones, fish, reptiles, and animals. This document is also thought to contain the first recorded reference of the usage of hops in beer as a preservative.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kitsock |first1=Greg |title=Hops: The beer ingredient (most) drinkers love |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/hops-the-beer-ingredient-most-drinkers-love/2014/02/10/fd5daab0-8f57-11e3-84e1-27626c5ef5fb_story.html |website=The Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Oliver |first1=Garrett |title=The Oxford Companion to Beer |date=9 September 2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=435}}</ref> The second, ''Causae et Curae'', is an exploration of the human body, its connections to the rest of the natural world, and the causes and cures of various diseases.<ref name=\"medical\">Hildegard von Bingen, ''Causae et Curae (Holistic Healing)'', trans. by Manfred Pawlik and Patrick Madigan, ed. by Mary Palmquist and John Kulas (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, Inc., 1994); Hildegard von Bingen, ''Physica'', trans. Priscilla Throop (Rochester, Vermont: Healing Arts Press, 1998).</ref> Hildegard documented various medical practices in these books, including the use of bleeding and home remedies for many common ailments. She also explains remedies for common agricultural injuries such as burns, fractures, dislocations, and cuts.<ref name=Sweet/> Hildegard may have used the books to teach assistants at the monastery. These books are historically significant because they show areas of medieval medicine that were not well documented because their practitioners (mainly women) rarely wrote in Latin. Her writings were commentated on by [[M\u00e9lanie Lipinska]], a Polish scientist.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Old Time Makers of Medicine|last=Walsh|first=James|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=1911|location=New York|pages=194\u2013201}}.</ref>\n\nIn addition to its wealth of practical evidence, ''Causae et Curae'' is also noteworthy for its organizational scheme. Its first part sets the work within the context of the creation of the cosmos and then humanity as its summit, and the constant interplay of the human person as microcosm both physically and spiritually with the macrocosm of the universe informs all of Hildegard's approach.<ref name=Glaze/> Her hallmark is to emphasize the vital connection between the \"green\" health of the natural world and the holistic health of the human person. ''Viriditas'', or greening power, was thought to sustain human beings and could be manipulated by adjusting the balance of elements within a person.<ref name=\"Sweet\" /> Thus, when she approached medicine as a type of gardening, it was not just as an analogy. Rather, Hildegard understood the plants and elements of the garden as direct counterparts to the humors and elements within the human body, whose imbalance led to illness and disease.<ref name=Sweet/>\n\nThus, the nearly three hundred chapters of the second book of ''Causae et Curae'' \"explore the etiology, or causes, of disease as well as human sexuality, psychology, and physiology.\"<ref name=Glaze/> In this section, she gives specific instructions for bleeding based on various factors, including gender, the phase of the moon (bleeding is best done when the moon is waning), the place of disease (use veins near diseased organ or body part) or prevention (big veins in arms), and how much blood to take (described in imprecise measurements, like \"the amount that a thirsty person can swallow in one gulp\"). She even includes bleeding instructions for animals to keep them healthy. In the third and fourth sections, Hildegard describes treatments for malignant and minor problems and diseases according to the humoral theory, again including information on animal health. The fifth section is about diagnosis and prognosis, which includes instructions to check the patient's blood, pulse, urine and stool.<ref name=Sweet/> Finally, the sixth section documents a lunar horoscope to provide an additional means of prognosis for both disease and other medical conditions, such as conception and the outcome of pregnancy.<ref name=Glaze/> For example, she indicates that a waxing moon is good for human conception and is also good for sowing seeds for plants (sowing seeds is the plant equivalent of conception).<ref name=Sweet/> Elsewhere, Hildegard is even said to have stressed the value of boiling drinking water in an attempt to prevent infection.<ref name=encyclopedia>\"Hildegard of Bingen.\" Encyclopedia of World Biography. 2004.</ref>\n\nAs Hildegard elaborates the medical and scientific relationship between the human microcosm and the macrocosm of the universe, she often focuses on interrelated patterns of four: \"the four elements (fire, air, water, and earth), the four seasons, the four humors, the four zones of the earth, and the four major winds.\"<ref name=Glaze/> Although she inherited the basic framework of [[humorism|humoral theory]] from ancient medicine, Hildegard's conception of the hierarchical inter-balance of the four humors (blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile) was unique, based on their correspondence to \"superior\" and \"inferior\" elements\u2014blood and phlegm corresponding to the \"celestial\" elements of fire and air, and the two biles corresponding to the \"terrestrial\" elements of water and earth. Hildegard understood the disease-causing imbalance of these humors to result from the improper dominance of the subordinate humors. This disharmony reflects that introduced by Adam and Eve in the Fall, which for Hildegard marked the indelible entrance of disease and humoral imbalance into humankind.<ref name=Glaze/> As she writes in ''Causae et Curae'' c. 42:\n\n<blockquote>It happens that certain men suffer diverse illnesses. This comes from the phlegm which is superabundant within them. For if man had remained in paradise, he would not have had the ''flegmata'' within his body, from which many evils proceed, but his flesh would have been whole and without dark humor [''livor'']. However, because he consented to evil and relinquished good, he was made into a likeness of the earth, which produces good and useful herbs, as well as bad and useless ones, and which has in itself both good and evil moistures. From tasting evil, the blood of the sons of Adam was turned into the poison of semen, out of which the sons of man are begotten. And therefore their flesh is ulcerated and permeable [to disease]. These sores and openings create a certain storm and smoky moisture in men, from which the ''flegmata'' arise and coagulate, which then introduce diverse infirmities to the human body. All this arose from the first evil, which man began at the start, because if Adam had remained in paradise, he would have had the sweetest health, and the best dwelling-place, just as the strongest balsam emits the best odor; but on the contrary, man now has within himself poison and phlegm and diverse illnesses.<ref>Quoted in Glaze, \"Medical Writer: 'Behold the Human Creature,'\" p. 136.</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== ''Lingua ignota'' and ''Litterae ignotae'' ===\n[[File:Litterae ignotae.png|thumb|right|Alphabet by Hildegard von Bingen, Litterae ignotae, which she used for her language [[Lingua Ignota]]]]\n\nHildegard also invented an [[constructed script|alternative alphabet]]. ''Litterae ignotae'' (''Alternate Alphabet'') was another work and was more or less a secret code, or even an intellectual code \u2013 much like a modern crossword puzzle today.\n\nThe text of her writing and compositions reveals Hildegard's use of this form of modified medieval [[Latin]], encompassing many invented, conflated and abridged words.<ref name=\"Ruether, Rosemary Radford 2002\" /> Because of her inventions of words for her lyrics and use of a constructed script, many [[conlang]]ers look upon her as a medieval precursor.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GkuK53bU4_UC ''Hildegard of Bingen's Unknown Language: An Edition, Translation, and Discussion''], ed. Sarah Higley (2007)</ref>\n\nHildegard's ''Lingua ignota'' (''Unknown Language'') was a composition that comprised a series of invented words that corresponded to an eclectic list of nouns. Scholars believe that Hildegard used her ''[[Lingua Ignota]]'' to increase solidarity among her nuns.<ref>Barbara J. Newman, \"Introduction\" to Hildegard, ''Scivias'', p. 13.</ref>\n\n==Significance==\n\n===During her lifetime===\nMaddocks claims that it is likely Hildegard learned simple Latin and the tenets of the Christian faith but was not instructed in the Seven [[Liberal Arts]], which formed the basis of all education for the learned classes in the Middle Ages: the ''[[Trivium (education)|Trivium]]'' of grammar, dialectic, and rhetoric plus the ''[[Quadrivium]]'' of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music.<ref>Maddocks, Fiona.

Her preaching was not limited to the monasteries; she preached publicly in 1160 in Germany. (New York: Routledge, 2001, 9). She conducted four preaching tours throughout Germany, speaking to both clergy and laity in chapter houses and in public, mainly denouncing clerical corruption and calling for reform.<ref>Ruether, Rosemary Radford.

It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] on December 21, 2001. In the episode, it is [[Christmas]] time in Quahog, a time when Lois's plans for a perfect holiday blow up in her face, causing her to have a mental breakdown. Stewie uses his role as the baby [[Jesus]] in the town play to be good for [[Santa Claus]], about whom he has become paranoid, and show Lois the true meaning of Christmas.\n\n\"A Very Special Family Guy Freakin' Christmas\" was written by [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]] and directed by Brian Hogan. Though the episode aired during the third season, it was a holdover from the [[Family Guy (season 2)|second production season]]. It featured guest performances from the original members of the rock band [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] ([[Peter Criss]], [[Ace Frehley]], [[Gene Simmons]], and [[Paul Stanley]]).\n\nIt is rated as TV-14<ref>http://www.tbs.com/shows/family-guy/season-3/episode-16/a-very-special-family-guy-freakin-christmas</ref> and also available on the ''Family Guy: Volume 2'' DVD.<ref>https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001N9VW5Y</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Lois Griffin|Lois]] signs [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] up to star as baby [[Jesus]] in a [[nativity scene]] at the Quahog [[Nativity play|Christmas pageant]]. Stewie plays along in hopes of pleasing [[Santa]], who he believes is [[omnipotent]] and thereby can supply him with [[plutonium]]. After Lois repeatedly reminds [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] to donate a present to [[Charitable organization|charity]], he mistakenly donates all of the family's [[Christmas]] gifts to a needy kids' charity. Lois seems unfazed by the mistake, but insists that the entire family shop for new presents at the mall. Peter reluctantly agrees, although he only wants to watch ''[[Kiss (band)|KISS]] Saves Santa'' on television; [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] stays behind to keep an eye on the turkey cooking in the oven. While at the mall, Peter finds a pair of [[barrette]]s that [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] wanted and ends up chasing down an old lady to a pet fish store called \"Age of Aquariums\", where the old lady throws fish food on him so that all the fish jump onto him to feed while the old lady escapes.\n\nMeanwhile, at home, an ember shoots onto the family rug from the [[fireplace]]. While Brian tries to deal with this crisis, the overcooked turkey begins to burn. Brian finds a [[fire extinguisher]], but to his dismay, it is merely a novelty item filled with [[Snake nut can|plastic snakes]], which, upon being released into the fire, promptly explode and make it worse. After using the real fire extinguisher, he slips on the foam from it and the TV falls on top of him. Afterwards the interior of the house is destroyed; Brian escapes, but with his paws burnt hairless. Amazingly, Lois maintains a cheerful attitude, saying that they just need to clean up a bit. However, when Meg tells her that they are out of [[paper towel]]s, Lois suffers a nervous breakdown and furiously screams at the family about how difficult it is to ensure that Christmas happens without a hitch, then runs from the ruined house on a rampage (Meg then ironically finds some paper towels mere seconds after Lois' rampage).\n\nLois storms through town, berating people for their [[Christmas]] [[optimism]]. When she reaches the town square, she climbs the [[Christmas tree]] there and grabs the ornamental star on top, bent on destroying it. The rest of the family arrives and Stewie, eager to perform a good deed to earn Santa's grace, performs an [[extemporaneous]] [[monologue]] about Jesus and the meaning of Christmas. Lois, watching Stewie, regains her sanity, but Peter, who thinks Lois isn't getting the message, allows the police to shoot her with a tranquilizer dart, just after she puts the star back on the tree.\n\nThe next morning at Christmas, the family opens their presents: Stewie gets his plutonium; Peter gets a week's vacation, a new [[VCR]], and his own copy of ''Kiss Saves Santa''; and Brian gets at what first appears to be a bottle of wine, but actually turns out to be a book. Lois is heavily [[sedated]], sitting limply in a rocking chair and drooling. In the closing scene, the Griffins wish everyone a Merry Christmas (though Lois is still too numb to speak clearly).<ref name=\"C188\"/>\n\n==Production==\nThe episode was originally intended to air in December 2000, as part of the [[Family Guy (season 2)|second season]].

Paganini's father was an unsuccessful trader, but he managed to supplement his income through playing music on the [[mandolin]]. At the age of five, Paganini started learning the mandolin from his father, and moved to the violin by the age of seven. His musical talents were quickly recognized, earning him numerous scholarships for violin lessons. The young Paganini studied under various local violinists, including Giovanni Servetto and Giacomo Costa, but his progress quickly outpaced their abilities. Paganini and his father then traveled to [[Parma]] to seek further guidance from [[Alessandro Rolla]]. But upon listening to Paganini's playing, Rolla immediately referred him to his own teacher, [[Ferdinando Paer]] and, later, Paer's own teacher, [[Gasparo Ghiretti]]. Though Paganini did not stay long with Paer or Ghiretti, the two had considerable influence on his composition style.\n\n===Early career===\nThe French invaded northern Italy in March 1796, and Genoa was not spared. The Paganinis sought refuge in their country property in Romairone, near [[Bolzaneto]]. It was in this period that Paganini is thought to have developed his relationship with the guitar.<ref>J.J. Sugden: ''Paganini, his Life and Work'', p. 17. UK 1980</ref> He mastered the guitar, but preferred to play it in exclusively intimate, rather than public concerts.<ref>P.J. Bone: ''The Guitar and Mandolin''. Schotts, UK 1954</ref> He later described the guitar as his \"constant companion\" on his concert tours. By 1800, Paganini and his father traveled to [[Livorno]], where Paganini played in concerts and his father resumed his maritime work. In 1801, the 18-year-old Paganini was appointed first violin of the [[Republic of Lucca]], but a substantial portion of his income came from freelancing. His fame as a violinist was matched only by his reputation as a gambler and womanizer.\n\nIn 1805, Lucca was annexed by [[Napoleon]]ic France, and the region was ceded to Napoleon's sister, [[Elisa Bonaparte|Elisa Baciocchi]]. Paganini became a violinist for the Baciocchi court, while giving private lessons to Elisa's husband, [[Felice Pasquale Baciocchi|Felice]]. In 1807, Baciocchi became the [[Grand Duchess of Tuscany]] and her court was transferred to [[Florence]]. Paganini was part of the entourage, but, towards the end of 1809, he left Baciocchi to resume his freelance career.\n\n===Travelling virtuoso===\n[[File:Nicolo Paganini by Richard James Lane.jpg|thumb|upright|1831 bulletin advertising a performance of Paganini]]\nFor the next few years, Paganini returned to touring in the areas surrounding Parma and Genoa. Though he was very popular with the local audience, he was still not very well known in the rest of Europe. His first break came from an 1813 concert at [[La Scala]] in Milan. The concert was a great success. As a result, Paganini began to attract the attention of other prominent, though more conservative, musicians across Europe. His early encounters with [[Charles Philippe Lafont]] and [[Louis Spohr]] created intense rivalry. His concert activities, however, were still limited to Italy for the next few years.\n\nIn 1827, [[Pope Leo XII]] honoured Paganini with the [[Order of the Golden Spur]].<ref name=\"pd1900\">David, Paul. \"Paganini, Nicolo\", Grove (ed.) ''A Dictionary of Music and Musicians'' (1900), Vol. II, pp. 628\u2013632.</ref><ref>''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' (1911), Vol. XX, p. 459, \"Paganini, Nicolo\".</ref> His fame spread across Europe with a concert tour that started in Vienna in August 1828, stopping in every major European city in Germany, Poland, and Bohemia until February 1831 in Strasbourg. This was followed by tours in Paris and Britain. His technical ability and his willingness to display it received much critical acclaim. In addition to his own compositions, theme and variations being the most popular, Paganini also performed modified versions of works (primarily concertos) written by his early contemporaries, such as [[Rodolphe Kreutzer]] and [[Giovanni Battista Viotti]].\n\nPaganini's travels also brought him into contact with eminent guitar virtuosi of the day, including [[Ferdinando Carulli]] in Paris and [[Mauro Giuliani]] in Vienna.<ref>Thomas F. Heck: ''Mauro Giuliani, a life for the Guitar'' (doctoral dissertation). GFA Reference, US 2013</ref> But this experience did not inspire him to play public concerts with guitar, and even performances of his own guitar trios and quartets were private to the point of being behind closed doors.\n\n===Late career and health decline===\nThroughout his life, Paganini was a stranger to chronic illnesses. Although no definite medical proof exists, he was reputed to have been affected by [[Marfan syndrome]]<ref>{{cite journal|first=Myron R.|last=Schoenfeld|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/239/1/40|title=Nicolo Paganini \u2013 Musical Magician and Marfan Mutant?|date=January 2, 1978|volume=239|number=1|pages=40\u201342|journal=[[The Journal of the American Medical Association]]|pmid=336919|accessdate=12 November 2011|doi=10.1001/jama.239.1.40}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.violinist.com/discussion/response.cfm?ID=13135 |title=Paganini's left hand |publisher=Violinist.com |accessdate=12 November 2011}}</ref> or [[Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 11694491 | volume=175 | issue=5 | title=Creativity and chronic disease.

He was diagnosed with [[syphilis]] as early as 1822, and his remedy, which included [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[opium]], came with serious physical and psychological side effects. In 1834, while still in Paris, he was treated for [[tuberculosis]]. Though his recovery was reasonably quick, after the illness his career was marred by frequent cancellations due to various health problems, from the common cold to depression, which lasted from days to months.\n\nIn September 1834, Paganini put an end to his concert career and returned to Genoa. Contrary to popular beliefs involving his wishing to keep his music and techniques secret, Paganini devoted his time to the publication of his compositions and violin methods. He accepted students, of whom two enjoyed moderate success: violinist [[Camillo Sivori]] and cellist Gaetano Ciandelli. Neither, however, considered Paganini helpful or inspirational. In 1835, Paganini returned to Parma, this time under the employ of [[Archduchess]] [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Marie Louise]] of Austria, Napoleon's second wife. He was in charge of reorganizing her court orchestra. However, he eventually conflicted with the players and court, so his visions never saw completion. In Paris, he befriended the 11-year-old Polish virtuoso [[Apollinaire de Kontski]], giving him some lessons and a signed testimonial. It was widely put about, falsely, that Paganini was so impressed with de Kontski's skills that he bequeathed him his violins and manuscripts.\n\n===Final years, death, and burial===\n[[File:Paganinitomb.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Paganini in [[Parma]], Italy]]\nIn 1836, Paganini returned to Paris to set up a casino. Its immediate failure left him in financial ruin, and he auctioned off his personal effects, including his musical instruments, to recoup his losses. At Christmas of 1838, he left Paris for Marseilles and, after a brief stay, travelled to Nice where his condition worsened. In May 1840, the Bishop of Nice sent Paganini a local parish priest to perform the [[last rites]]. Paganini assumed the sacrament was premature, and refused.<ref name=\"pd1900\" />\n\nA week later, on 27 May 1840, Paganini died from internal hemorrhaging before a priest could be summoned. Because of this, and his widely rumored association with the devil, the Church denied his body a Catholic burial in Genoa.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} It took four years and an appeal to the Pope before the Church let his body be transported to Genoa, but it was still not buried. His body was finally buried in 1876, in a cemetery in Parma. In 1893, the Czech violinist [[Franti\u0161ek Ond\u0159\u00ed\u010dek]] persuaded Paganini's grandson, Attila, to allow a viewing of the violinist's body. After this episode, Paganini's body was finally reinterred in a new cemetery in Parma in 1896.\n\n===Personal and professional relationships===\nThough having no shortage of romantic conquests, Paganini was seriously involved with a singer named Antonia Bianchi from Como, whom he met in Milan in 1813. The two gave concerts together throughout Italy. They had a son, Achille Ciro Alessandro, born on 23 July 1825 in Palermo and baptized at San Bartolomeo's. They never legalized their union and it ended around April 1828 in Vienna. Paganini brought Achille on his European tours, and Achille later accompanied his father until the latter's death. He was instrumental in dealing with his father's burial, years after his death.\n\nThroughout his career, Paganini also became close friends with composers [[Gioachino Rossini]] and [[Hector Berlioz]]. Rossini and Paganini met in Bologna in the summer of 1818. In January 1821, on his return from Naples, Paganini met Rossini again in Rome, just in time to become the substitute conductor for Rossini's opera ''[[Matilde di Shabran]]'', upon the sudden death of the original conductor. Paganini's efforts earned gratitude from Rossini.\n\nPaganini met Berlioz in Paris, and was a frequent correspondent as a penfriend. He commissioned a piece from the composer, but was not satisfied with the resultant four-movement piece for orchestra and viola obbligato ''[[Harold en Italie]]''. He never performed it, and instead it was premiered a year later by violist [[Chr\u00e9tien Urhan|Christian Urhan]]. He did however write his own ''Sonata per Gran Viola'' Op. 35 (with orchestra or guitar accompaniment). Despite his alleged lack of interest in ''Harold'', Paganini often referred to Berlioz as the resurrection of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and, towards the end of his life, he gave large sums to the composer. They shared an active interest in the guitar, which they both played and used in compositions. Paganini gave Berlioz a guitar, which they both signed on its [[sound box]].\n\n===Instruments===\n[[File:Strad-hubay-view.jpg|thumb|Views of the ''Hubay'' 1726 [[Stradivarius|Stradivari]]]]\nPaganini was in possession of a number of fine stringed instruments. More legendary than these were the circumstances under which he obtained (and lost) some of them. While Paganini was still a teenager in [[Livorno]], a wealthy businessman named Livron lent him a violin, made by the master luthier [[Giuseppe Guarneri]], for a concert. Livron was so impressed with Paganini's playing that he refused to take it back. This particular violin came to be known as ''[[Il Cannone Guarnerius]]''.<ref name=\"Menuhin\">Yehudi Menuhin and Curtis W. Davis. ''The Music of Man''. Methuen, 1979.</ref> On a later occasion in Parma, he won another valuable violin (also by Guarneri) after a difficult sight-reading challenge from a man named Pasini.\n\n[[File:Bartolomeo giuseppe guarneri, violino cannone, appartenuto a niccol\u00f2 paganini, cremona 1743.JPG|left|thumb|upright|''[[Il Cannone Guarnerius]]'' on exhibit at the [[Palazzo Doria-Tursi]] in Genoa, Italy]]\nOther instruments associated with Paganini include the ''Antonio [[Amati]]'' 1600, the ''[[Nicol\u00f2 Amati]]'' 1657, the ''[[List of Stradivarius instruments|Paganini-Desaint]]'' 1680 [[Stradivarius|Stradivari]], the [[Giuseppe Giovanni Battista Guarneri|Guarneri-filius]] ''Andrea'' 1706, the ''[[Le Brun Stradivarius|Le Brun]]'' 1712 Stradivari, the ''[[Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume|Vuillaume]]'' c.&nbsp;1720 [[Carlo Bergonzi (luthier)|Bergonzi]], the ''Hubay'' 1726 Stradivari, and the ''Comte&nbsp;Cozio di Salabue'' 1727 violins; the ''Countess of Flanders'' 1582 [[Gasparo da Sal\u00f2|da&nbsp;Sal\u00f2-di&nbsp;Bertolotti]], and the ''Mendelssohn'' 1731 Stradivari violas; the ''Piatti'' 1700 [[Matteo Goffriller|Goffriller]], the ''Stanlein'' 1707 Stradivari, and the ''Ladenburg'' 1736 Stradivari cellos; and the ''Grobert of Mirecourt'' 1820 (guitar).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mediatheque.cite-musique.fr/ClientBookLineCIMU/recherche/NoticeDetailleByID.asp?ID=0161650 |title=Mediatheque.cite |publisher=Mediatheque.cite-musique.fr |accessdate=12 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://boulevarddesresistants.hautetfort.com/archive/2008/01/23/histoire-d-une-guitare-romantique.html |title=Hautetfort.com |publisher=Boulevarddesresistants.hautetfort.com |date=23 January 2008 |accessdate=12 November 2011}}</ref> Four of these instruments were played by the [[Tokyo String Quartet]].\n\nOf his guitars, there is little evidence remaining of his various choices of instrument. The aforementioned guitar that he gave to Berlioz is a French instrument made by one Grobert of [[Mirecourt]]. The luthier made his instrument in the style of [[Ren\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois Lac\u00f4te|Ren\u00e9 Lac\u00f4te]], a more well-known Paris-based guitar-maker. It is preserved and on display in the [[Mus\u00e9e de la Musique]] in Paris.\n\nOf the guitars he owned through his life, there was an instrument by Gennaro Fabricatore that he had refused to sell even in his periods of financial stress, and was among the instruments in his possession at the time of his death. There is an unsubstantiated rumour that he also played [[Johann Georg Stauffer|Stauffer]] guitars; he may certainly have come across these in his meetings with Giuliani in Vienna.\n\n==Compositions==\n{{listen|type=music|\n|filename=20091104 Joshua Bell and Sharon Isbin - Paganini's Cantabile.ogv\n|title=''Cantabile'' (Paganini)\n|description=[[Joshua Bell]] and [[Sharon Isbin]] perform Paganini's ''Cantabile'' at the [[White House]] Evening of Classical Music on 4 November 2009.\n|filename2=20091104 Joshua Bell and Sharon Isbin - Paganini's Cantabile.ogg\n|title2=''Cantabile'' (Paganini)\n|description2=Bell and Isbin \u2013 audio only version\n|filename3=CELLO ENCORES JOHN MICHEL-Paganini Variations on One String.ogg\n|title3=Variations on One String (Moses Fantasy)\n|description3=Performed by John Michell (cello) with a pianist}}\n{{Main|List of compositions by Niccol\u00f2 Paganini}}\nPaganini composed his own works to play exclusively in his concerts, all of which profoundly influenced the evolution of violin technique. His [[24 Caprices for Solo Violin (Paganini)|24 Caprices]] were likely composed in the period between 1805 and 1809, while he was in the service of the Baciocchi court. Also during this period, he composed the majority of the solo pieces, duo-sonatas, trios and quartets for the guitar, either as a solo instrument or with strings. These chamber works may have been inspired by the publication, in Lucca, of the guitar quintets of Boccherini. Many of his variations, including ''Le Streghe'', ''The Carnival of Venice'', and ''Nel cor pi\u00f9 non mi sento'', were composed, or at least first performed, before his European concert tour.\n\nGenerally speaking, Paganini's compositions were technically imaginative, and the [[timbre]] of the instrument was greatly expanded as a result of these works. Sounds of different musical instruments and animals were often imitated. One such composition was titled ''Il Fandango Spanolo'' (The Spanish Dance), which featured a series of humorous imitations of farm animals. Even more outrageous was a solo piece ''Duetto Amoroso'', in which the sighs and groans of lovers were intimately depicted on the violin. There survives a manuscript of the ''Duetto'', which has been recorded. The existence of the ''Fandango'' is known only through concert posters.\n\nHowever, his works were criticized for lacking characteristics of true polyphonism, as pointed out by [[Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe]].<ref>Lev Solomonovich Ginzburg. ''Ysaye''. Paganiniana, 1980.</ref> [[Yehudi Menuhin]], on the other hand, suggested that this might have been the result of his reliance on the guitar (in lieu of the piano) as an aid in composition.<ref name=\"Menuhin\" /> The orchestral parts for his concertos were often polite, unadventurous, and clearly supportive of the soloist. In this, his style is consistent with that of other Italian composers such as [[Giovanni Paisiello]], Gioachino Rossini and [[Gaetano Donizetti]], who were influenced by the guitar-song milieu of Naples during this period.<ref>N. Till: Rossini, pp. 50\u201351. Omnibus Press, 1987</ref>\n\nPaganini was also the inspiration of many prominent composers. Both \"La Campanella\" and the [[Caprice No. 24 (Paganini)|A&nbsp;minor Caprice (No.&nbsp;24)]] have been an object of interest for a number of composers. [[Franz Liszt]], [[Robert Schumann]], [[Johannes Brahms]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Boris Blacher]], [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], [[George Rochberg]] and [[Witold Lutos\u0142awski]], among others, wrote well-known variations on these themes.\n\n==Violin technique==\n[[File:David d'Angers - Paganini.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Bust of Niccol\u00f2 Paganini by [[David d'Angers]] (1830\u20131833)]]\nThe Israeli violinist [[Ivry Gitlis]] once referred to Paganini as a phenomenon rather than a development. Though some of the techniques frequently employed by Paganini were already present, most accomplished violinists of the time focused on intonation and bowing techniques. [[Arcangelo Corelli]] (1653\u20131713) was considered a pioneer in transforming the violin from an ensemble instrument to a solo instrument. In the meantime, the polyphonic capability of the violin was firmly established through the [[Sonatas and partitas for solo violin (Bach)|Sonatas and Partitas]] BWV 1001\u20131006 of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (1685\u20131750). Other notable violinists included [[Antonio Vivaldi]] (1678\u20131741) and [[Giuseppe Tartini]] (1692\u20131770), who, in their compositions, reflected the increasing technical and musical demands on the violinist. Although the role of the violin in music drastically changed through this period, progress in violin technique was steady but slow. Techniques requiring agility of the fingers and the bow were still considered unorthodox and discouraged by the established community of violinists.\n\nMuch of Paganini's playing (and his violin composition) was influenced by two violinists, [[Pietro Locatelli]] (1693\u20131746) and [[August Duranowski]] (Auguste Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Durand) (1770\u20131834). During Paganini's study in Parma, he came across the 24 Caprices of Locatelli (entitled ''L'arte di nuova modulazione \u2013 Capricci enigmatici'' or ''The art of the new style \u2013 the enigmatic caprices''). Published in the 1730s, they were shunned by the musical authorities for their technical innovations, and were forgotten by the musical community at large. Around the same time, Durand, a former student of [[Giovanni Battista Viotti]] (1755\u20131824), became a celebrated violinist. He was renowned for his use of harmonics, both natural and artificial (which had previously not been attempted in performance), and the left hand [[pizzicato]] in his performance.<ref>Richard Taruskin, ''An Oxford History of Western Music Volume 5: Music in the Nineteenth Century''. Oxford University Press, 2009</ref> Paganini was impressed by Durand's innovations and showmanship, which later also became the hallmarks of the young violin virtuoso. Paganini was instrumental in the revival and popularization of these violinistic techniques, which are now incorporated into regular compositions.\n\nAnother aspect of Paganini's violin techniques concerned his flexibility. He had exceptionally long fingers and was capable of playing three octaves across four strings in a hand span, an extraordinary feat even by today's standards. His seemingly unnatural ability may have been a result of [[Marfan syndrome]].<ref>From [http://tafkac.org/celebrities/paganini_stories_myths.html Paganini stories myths.] The AFU and Urban Legends Archive.

The series focuses on Paganini's relationship with the Roman Catholic Church. Another Soviet actor, [[Armen Dzhigarkhanyan]], played Paganini's fictionalized arch-rival, an insidious [[Jesuit]] official. The information in the series is generally spurious, and it also plays to some of the myths and legends rampant during the musician's lifetime. One memorable scene shows Paganini's adversaries sabotaging his violin before a high-profile performance, causing all strings but one to break during the concert. An undeterred Paganini continues to perform on three, two, and finally on a single string. In actuality, Paganini himself occasionally broke strings during his performances on purpose so he could further display his virtuosity.<ref>\"Paganini, Niccol\u00f2.\" ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Ultimate Reference Suite.'' Chicago: Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 2011.</ref> He did this by carefully filing notches into them to weaken them, so that they would break when in use.\n\nIn [[Don Nigro]]'s satirical comedy play ''Paganini'' (1995), the great violinist seeks vainly for his salvation, claiming that he unknowingly [[Deal with the Devil|sold his soul to the Devil]]. \"Variation upon variation,\" he cries at one point, \"but which variation leads to salvation and which to damnation? Music is a question for which there is no answer.\" Paganini is portrayed as having killed three of his lovers and sinking repeatedly into poverty, prison, and drink. Each time he is \"rescued\" by the Devil, who appears in different guises, returning Paganini's violin so he can continue playing. In the end, Paganini's salvation\u2014administered by a god-like Clockmaker\u2014turns out to be imprisonment in a large bottle where he plays his music for the amusement of the public through all eternity. \"Do not pity him, my dear,\" the Clockmaker tells Antonia, one of Paganini's murdered wives. \"He is alone with the answer for which there is no question. The saved and the damned are the same.\"\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Angelo Boscassi, ''Il Violino di Niccol\u00f2 Paganini conservato nel Palazzo Municipale di Genova'', Fratelli Pagano, 1909\n* Leopold Auer, ''Violin playing as I teach it'', Stokes, 1921 (reprint Dover, 1980)\n* Alberto Bachmann, ''An Encyclopedia of the violin'', Da Capo, 1925\n* Jeffrey Pulver, ''Paganini: The Romantic Virtuoso'', Herbert Joseph, 1936 (reprint Da Capo, 1970)\n* Geraldine I.C. de Courcy, ''Paganini the Genoese'', University of Oklahoma, 1957 (reprint Da Capo, 1977)\n* [[Yehudi Menuhin]] and [[William Primrose]], ''Violin and viola'', MacDonald and Jane's, 1976\n* Yehudi Menuhin and Curtis W.

He was the most celebrated violin [[virtuoso]] of his time, and left his mark as one of the pillars of modern violin technique. His [[24 Caprices for Solo Violin (Paganini)|24 Caprices for Solo Violin Op. 1]] are among the best known of his compositions, and have served as an inspiration for many prominent composers.\n[[File:Paganinis all six violin concertos Nikolay Madoyan Conductor Karen Durgaryan camera recording from hall Armenian National Academic Theater Symphonic Orchestra - Paganini's Cantabile.webm|thumb|Paganini: all six violin concertos]]\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Niccol\u00f2 Paganini ritratto giovanile.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of young Paganini]]\n\n===Childhood===\nNiccol\u00f2 Paganini was born in [[Genoa]], then capital of the [[Republic of Genoa]], the third of the six children of Antonio and Teresa (n\u00e9e Bocciardo) Paganini. Paganini's father was an unsuccessful trader, but he managed to supplement his income through playing music on the [[mandolin]]. At the age of five, Paganini started learning the mandolin from his father, and moved to the violin by the age of seven. His musical talents were quickly recognized, earning him numerous scholarships for violin lessons. The young Paganini studied under various local violinists, including Giovanni Servetto and Giacomo Costa, but his progress quickly outpaced their abilities. Paganini and his father then traveled to [[Parma]] to seek further guidance from [[Alessandro Rolla]]. But upon listening to Paganini's playing, Rolla immediately referred him to his own teacher, [[Ferdinando Paer]] and, later, Paer's own teacher, [[Gasparo Ghiretti]]. Though Paganini did not stay long with Paer or Ghiretti, the two had considerable influence on his composition style.\n\n===Early career===\nThe French invaded northern Italy in March 1796, and Genoa was not spared. The Paganinis sought refuge in their country property in Romairone, near [[Bolzaneto]]. It was in this period that Paganini is thought to have developed his relationship with the guitar.<ref>J.J. Sugden: ''Paganini, his Life and Work'', p. 17. UK 1980</ref> He mastered the guitar, but preferred to play it in exclusively intimate, rather than public concerts.<ref>P.J. Bone: ''The Guitar and Mandolin''. Schotts, UK 1954</ref> He later described the guitar as his \"constant companion\" on his concert tours. By 1800, Paganini and his father traveled to [[Livorno]], where Paganini played in concerts and his father resumed his maritime work. In 1801, the 18-year-old Paganini was appointed first violin of the [[Republic of Lucca]], but a substantial portion of his income came from freelancing. His fame as a violinist was matched only by his reputation as a gambler and womanizer.\n\nIn 1805, Lucca was annexed by [[Napoleon]]ic France, and the region was ceded to Napoleon's sister, [[Elisa Bonaparte|Elisa Baciocchi]]. Paganini became a violinist for the Baciocchi court, while giving private lessons to Elisa's husband, [[Felice Pasquale Baciocchi|Felice]]. In 1807, Baciocchi became the [[Grand Duchess of Tuscany]] and her court was transferred to [[Florence]]. Paganini was part of the entourage, but, towards the end of 1809, he left Baciocchi to resume his freelance career.\n\n===Travelling virtuoso===\n[[File:Nicolo Paganini by Richard James Lane.jpg|thumb|upright|1831 bulletin advertising a performance of Paganini]]\nFor the next few years, Paganini returned to touring in the areas surrounding Parma and Genoa. Though he was very popular with the local audience, he was still not very well known in the rest of Europe. His first break came from an 1813 concert at [[La Scala]] in Milan. The concert was a great success. As a result, Paganini began to attract the attention of other prominent, though more conservative, musicians across Europe. His early encounters with [[Charles Philippe Lafont]] and [[Louis Spohr]] created intense rivalry. His concert activities, however, were still limited to Italy for the next few years.\n\nIn 1827, [[Pope Leo XII]] honoured Paganini with the [[Order of the Golden Spur]].<ref name=\"pd1900\">David, Paul. \"Paganini, Nicolo\", Grove (ed.) ''A Dictionary of Music and Musicians'' (1900), Vol. II, pp. 628\u2013632.</ref><ref>''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' (1911), Vol. XX, p. 459, \"Paganini, Nicolo\".</ref> His fame spread across Europe with a concert tour that started in Vienna in August 1828, stopping in every major European city in Germany, Poland, and Bohemia until February 1831 in Strasbourg. This was followed by tours in Paris and Britain. His technical ability and his willingness to display it received much critical acclaim. In addition to his own compositions, theme and variations being the most popular, Paganini also performed modified versions of works (primarily concertos) written by his early contemporaries, such as [[Rodolphe Kreutzer]] and [[Giovanni Battista Viotti]].\n\nPaganini's travels also brought him into contact with eminent guitar virtuosi of the day, including [[Ferdinando Carulli]] in Paris and [[Mauro Giuliani]] in Vienna.<ref>Thomas F. Heck: ''Mauro Giuliani, a life for the Guitar'' (doctoral dissertation). GFA Reference, US 2013</ref> But this experience did not inspire him to play public concerts with guitar, and even performances of his own guitar trios and quartets were private to the point of being behind closed doors.\n\n===Late career and health decline===\nThroughout his life, Paganini was no stranger to chronic illnesses. Although no definite medical proof exists, he was reputed to have been affected by [[Marfan syndrome]]<ref>{{cite journal|first=Myron R.|last=Schoenfeld|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/239/1/40|title=Nicolo Paganini \u2013 Musical Magician and Marfan Mutant?|date=January 2, 1978|volume=239|number=1|pages=40\u201342|journal=[[The Journal of the American Medical Association]]|pmid=336919|accessdate=12 November 2011|doi=10.1001/jama.239.1.40}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.violinist.com/discussion/response.cfm?ID=13135 |title=Paganini's left hand |publisher=Violinist.com |accessdate=12 November 2011}}</ref> or [[Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome]].<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 11694491 | volume=175 | issue=5 | title=Creativity and chronic disease.

He was diagnosed with [[syphilis]] as early as 1822, and his remedy, which included [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[opium]], came with serious physical and psychological side effects. In 1834, while still in Paris, he was treated for [[tuberculosis]]. Though his recovery was reasonably quick, after the illness his career was marred by frequent cancellations due to various health problems, from the common cold to depression, which lasted from days to months.\n\nIn September 1834, Paganini put an end to his concert career and returned to Genoa. Contrary to popular beliefs involving his wishing to keep his music and techniques secret, Paganini devoted his time to the publication of his compositions and violin methods. He accepted students, of whom two enjoyed moderate success: violinist [[Camillo Sivori]] and cellist Gaetano Ciandelli. Neither, however, considered Paganini helpful or inspirational. In 1835, Paganini returned to Parma, this time under the employ of [[Archduchess]] [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma|Marie Louise]] of Austria, Napoleon's second wife. He was in charge of reorganizing her court orchestra. However, he eventually conflicted with the players and court, so his visions never saw completion. In Paris, he befriended the 11-year-old Polish virtuoso [[Apollinaire de Kontski]], giving him some lessons and a signed testimonial. It was widely put about, falsely, that Paganini was so impressed with de Kontski's skills that he bequeathed him his violins and manuscripts.\n\n===Final years, death, and burial===\n[[File:Paganinitomb.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Paganini in [[Parma]], Italy]]\nIn 1836, Paganini returned to Paris to set up a casino. Its immediate failure left him in financial ruin, and he auctioned off his personal effects, including his musical instruments, to recoup his losses. At Christmas of 1838, he left Paris for Marseilles and, after a brief stay, travelled to Nice where his condition worsened. In May 1840, the Bishop of Nice sent Paganini a local parish priest to perform the [[last rites]]. Paganini assumed the sacrament was premature, and refused.<ref name=\"pd1900\" />\n\nA week later, on 27 May 1840, Paganini died from internal hemorrhaging before a priest could be summoned. Because of this, and his widely rumored association with the devil, the Church denied his body a Catholic burial in Genoa.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} It took four years and an appeal to the Pope before the Church let his body be transported to Genoa, but it was still not buried. His body was finally buried in 1876, in a cemetery in Parma. In 1893, the Czech violinist [[Franti\u0161ek Ond\u0159\u00ed\u010dek]] persuaded Paganini's grandson, Attila, to allow a viewing of the violinist's body. After this episode, Paganini's body was finally reinterred in a new cemetery in Parma in 1896.\n\n===Personal and professional relationships===\nThough having no shortage of romantic conquests, Paganini was seriously involved with a singer named Antonia Bianchi from Como, whom he met in Milan in 1813. The two gave concerts together throughout Italy. They had a son, Achille Ciro Alessandro, born on 23 July 1825 in Palermo and baptized at San Bartolomeo's. They never legalized their union and it ended around April 1828 in Vienna. Paganini brought Achille on his European tours, and Achille later accompanied his father until the latter's death. He was instrumental in dealing with his father's burial, years after his death.\n\nThroughout his career, Paganini also became close friends with composers [[Gioachino Rossini]] and [[Hector Berlioz]]. Rossini and Paganini met in Bologna in the summer of 1818. In January 1821, on his return from Naples, Paganini met Rossini again in Rome, just in time to become the substitute conductor for Rossini's opera ''[[Matilde di Shabran]]'', upon the sudden death of the original conductor. Paganini's efforts earned gratitude from Rossini.\n\nPaganini met Berlioz in Paris, and was a frequent correspondent as a penfriend. He commissioned a piece from the composer, but was not satisfied with the resultant four-movement piece for orchestra and viola obbligato ''[[Harold en Italie]]''. He never performed it, and instead it was premiered a year later by violist [[Chr\u00e9tien Urhan|Christian Urhan]]. He did however write his own ''Sonata per Gran Viola'' Op. 35 (with orchestra or guitar accompaniment). Despite his alleged lack of interest in ''Harold'', Paganini often referred to Berlioz as the resurrection of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and, towards the end of his life, he gave large sums to the composer. They shared an active interest in the guitar, which they both played and used in compositions. Paganini gave Berlioz a guitar, which they both signed on its [[sound box]].\n\n===Instruments===\n[[File:Strad-hubay-view.jpg|thumb|Views of the ''Hubay'' 1726 [[Stradivarius|Stradivari]]]]\nPaganini was in possession of a number of fine stringed instruments. More legendary than these were the circumstances under which he obtained (and lost) some of them. While Paganini was still a teenager in [[Livorno]], a wealthy businessman named Livron lent him a violin, made by the master luthier [[Giuseppe Guarneri]], for a concert. Livron was so impressed with Paganini's playing that he refused to take it back. This particular violin came to be known as ''[[Il Cannone Guarnerius]]''.<ref name=\"Menuhin\">Yehudi Menuhin and Curtis W. Davis. ''The Music of Man''. Methuen, 1979.</ref> On a later occasion in Parma, he won another valuable violin (also by Guarneri) after a difficult sight-reading challenge from a man named Pasini.\n\n[[File:Bartolomeo giuseppe guarneri, violino cannone, appartenuto a niccol\u00f2 paganini, cremona 1743.JPG|left|thumb|upright|''[[Il Cannone Guarnerius]]'' on exhibit at the [[Palazzo Doria-Tursi]] in Genoa, Italy]]\nOther instruments associated with Paganini include the ''Antonio [[Amati]]'' 1600, the ''[[Nicol\u00f2 Amati]]'' 1657, the ''[[List of Stradivarius instruments|Paganini-Desaint]]'' 1680 [[Stradivarius|Stradivari]], the [[Giuseppe Giovanni Battista Guarneri|Guarneri-filius]] ''Andrea'' 1706, the ''[[Le Brun Stradivarius|Le Brun]]'' 1712 Stradivari, the ''[[Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume|Vuillaume]]'' c.&nbsp;1720 [[Carlo Bergonzi (luthier)|Bergonzi]], the ''Hubay'' 1726 Stradivari, and the ''Comte&nbsp;Cozio di Salabue'' 1727 violins; the ''Countess of Flanders'' 1582 [[Gasparo da Sal\u00f2|da&nbsp;Sal\u00f2-di&nbsp;Bertolotti]], and the ''Mendelssohn'' 1731 Stradivari violas; the ''Piatti'' 1700 [[Matteo Goffriller|Goffriller]], the ''Stanlein'' 1707 Stradivari, and the ''Ladenburg'' 1736 Stradivari cellos; and the ''Grobert of Mirecourt'' 1820 (guitar).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mediatheque.cite-musique.fr/ClientBookLineCIMU/recherche/NoticeDetailleByID.asp?ID=0161650 |title=Mediatheque.cite |publisher=Mediatheque.cite-musique.fr |accessdate=12 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://boulevarddesresistants.hautetfort.com/archive/2008/01/23/histoire-d-une-guitare-romantique.html |title=Hautetfort.com |publisher=Boulevarddesresistants.hautetfort.com |date=23 January 2008 |accessdate=12 November 2011}}</ref> Four of these instruments were played by the [[Tokyo String Quartet]].\n\nOf his guitars, there is little evidence remaining of his various choices of instrument. The aforementioned guitar that he gave to Berlioz is a French instrument made by one Grobert of [[Mirecourt]]. The luthier made his instrument in the style of [[Ren\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois Lac\u00f4te|Ren\u00e9 Lac\u00f4te]], a more well-known Paris-based guitar-maker. It is preserved and on display in the [[Mus\u00e9e de la Musique]] in Paris.\n\nOf the guitars he owned through his life, there was an instrument by Gennaro Fabricatore that he had refused to sell even in his periods of financial stress, and was among the instruments in his possession at the time of his death. There is an unsubstantiated rumour that he also played [[Johann Georg Stauffer|Stauffer]] guitars; he may certainly have come across these in his meetings with Giuliani in Vienna.\n\n==Compositions==\n{{listen|type=music|\n|filename=20091104 Joshua Bell and Sharon Isbin - Paganini's Cantabile.ogv\n|title=''Cantabile'' (Paganini)\n|description=[[Joshua Bell]] and [[Sharon Isbin]] perform Paganini's ''Cantabile'' at the [[White House]] Evening of Classical Music on 4 November 2009.\n|filename2=20091104 Joshua Bell and Sharon Isbin - Paganini's Cantabile.ogg\n|title2=''Cantabile'' (Paganini)\n|description2=Bell and Isbin \u2013 audio only version\n|filename3=CELLO ENCORES JOHN MICHEL-Paganini Variations on One String.ogg\n|title3=Variations on One String (Moses Fantasy)\n|description3=Performed by John Michell (cello) with a pianist}}\n{{Main|List of compositions by Niccol\u00f2 Paganini}}\nPaganini composed his own works to play exclusively in his concerts, all of which profoundly influenced the evolution of violin technique. His [[24 Caprices for Solo Violin (Paganini)|24 Caprices]] were likely composed in the period between 1805 and 1809, while he was in the service of the Baciocchi court. Also during this period, he composed the majority of the solo pieces, duo-sonatas, trios and quartets for the guitar, either as a solo instrument or with strings. These chamber works may have been inspired by the publication, in Lucca, of the guitar quintets of Boccherini. Many of his variations, including ''Le Streghe'', ''The Carnival of Venice'', and ''Nel cor pi\u00f9 non mi sento'', were composed, or at least first performed, before his European concert tour.\n\nGenerally speaking, Paganini's compositions were technically imaginative, and the [[timbre]] of the instrument was greatly expanded as a result of these works. Sounds of different musical instruments and animals were often imitated. One such composition was titled ''Il Fandango Spanolo'' (The Spanish Dance), which featured a series of humorous imitations of farm animals. Even more outrageous was a solo piece ''Duetto Amoroso'', in which the sighs and groans of lovers were intimately depicted on the violin. There survives a manuscript of the ''Duetto'', which has been recorded. The existence of the ''Fandango'' is known only through concert posters.\n\nHowever, his works were criticized for lacking characteristics of true polyphonism, as pointed out by [[Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe]].<ref>Lev Solomonovich Ginzburg. ''Ysaye''. Paganiniana, 1980.</ref> [[Yehudi Menuhin]], on the other hand, suggested that this might have been the result of his reliance on the guitar (in lieu of the piano) as an aid in composition.<ref name=\"Menuhin\" /> The orchestral parts for his concertos were often polite, unadventurous, and clearly supportive of the soloist. In this, his style is consistent with that of other Italian composers such as [[Giovanni Paisiello]], Gioachino Rossini and [[Gaetano Donizetti]], who were influenced by the guitar-song milieu of Naples during this period.<ref>N. Till: Rossini, pp. 50\u201351. Omnibus Press, 1987</ref>\n\nPaganini was also the inspiration of many prominent composers. Both \"La Campanella\" and the [[Caprice No. 24 (Paganini)|A&nbsp;minor Caprice (No.&nbsp;24)]] have been an object of interest for a number of composers. [[Franz Liszt]], [[Robert Schumann]], [[Johannes Brahms]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Boris Blacher]], [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], [[George Rochberg]] and [[Witold Lutos\u0142awski]], among others, wrote well-known variations on these themes.\n\n==Violin technique==\n[[File:David d'Angers - Paganini.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Bust of Niccol\u00f2 Paganini by [[David d'Angers]] (1830\u20131833)]]\nThe Israeli violinist [[Ivry Gitlis]] once referred to Paganini as a phenomenon rather than a development. Though some of the techniques frequently employed by Paganini were already present, most accomplished violinists of the time focused on intonation and bowing techniques. [[Arcangelo Corelli]] (1653\u20131713) was considered a pioneer in transforming the violin from an ensemble instrument to a solo instrument. In the meantime, the polyphonic capability of the violin was firmly established through the [[Sonatas and partitas for solo violin (Bach)|Sonatas and Partitas]] BWV 1001\u20131006 of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (1685\u20131750). Other notable violinists included [[Antonio Vivaldi]] (1678\u20131741) and [[Giuseppe Tartini]] (1692\u20131770), who, in their compositions, reflected the increasing technical and musical demands on the violinist. Although the role of the violin in music drastically changed through this period, progress in violin technique was steady but slow. Techniques requiring agility of the fingers and the bow were still considered unorthodox and discouraged by the established community of violinists.\n\nMuch of Paganini's playing (and his violin composition) was influenced by two violinists, [[Pietro Locatelli]] (1693\u20131746) and [[August Duranowski]] (Auguste Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Durand) (1770\u20131834). During Paganini's study in Parma, he came across the 24 Caprices of Locatelli (entitled ''L'arte di nuova modulazione \u2013 Capricci enigmatici'' or ''The art of the new style \u2013 the enigmatic caprices''). Published in the 1730s, they were shunned by the musical authorities for their technical innovations, and were forgotten by the musical community at large. Around the same time, Durand, a former student of [[Giovanni Battista Viotti]] (1755\u20131824), became a celebrated violinist. He was renowned for his use of harmonics, both natural and artificial (which had previously not been attempted in performance), and the left hand [[pizzicato]] in his performance.<ref>Richard Taruskin, ''An Oxford History of Western Music Volume 5: Music in the Nineteenth Century''. Oxford University Press, 2009</ref> Paganini was impressed by Durand's innovations and showmanship, which later also became the hallmarks of the young violin virtuoso. Paganini was instrumental in the revival and popularization of these violinistic techniques, which are now incorporated into regular compositions.\n\nAnother aspect of Paganini's violin techniques concerned his flexibility. He had exceptionally long fingers and was capable of playing three octaves across four strings in a hand span, an extraordinary feat even by today's standards. His seemingly unnatural ability may have been a result of [[Marfan syndrome]].<ref>From [http://tafkac.org/celebrities/paganini_stories_myths.html Paganini stories myths.] The AFU and Urban Legends Archive.

The series focuses on Paganini's relationship with the Roman Catholic Church. Another Soviet actor, [[Armen Dzhigarkhanyan]], played Paganini's fictionalized arch-rival, an insidious [[Jesuit]] official. The information in the series is generally spurious, and it also plays to some of the myths and legends rampant during the musician's lifetime. One memorable scene shows Paganini's adversaries sabotaging his violin before a high-profile performance, causing all strings but one to break during the concert. An undeterred Paganini continues to perform on three, two, and finally on a single string. In actuality, Paganini himself occasionally broke strings during his performances on purpose so he could further display his virtuosity.<ref>\"Paganini, Niccol\u00f2.\" ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Ultimate Reference Suite.'' Chicago: Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 2011.</ref> He did this by carefully filing notches into them to weaken them, so that they would break when in use.\n\nIn [[Don Nigro]]'s satirical comedy play ''Paganini'' (1995), the great violinist seeks vainly for his salvation, claiming that he unknowingly [[Deal with the Devil|sold his soul to the Devil]]. \"Variation upon variation,\" he cries at one point, \"but which variation leads to salvation and which to damnation? Music is a question for which there is no answer.\" Paganini is portrayed as having killed three of his lovers and sinking repeatedly into poverty, prison, and drink. Each time he is \"rescued\" by the Devil, who appears in different guises, returning Paganini's violin so he can continue playing. In the end, Paganini's salvation\u2014administered by a god-like Clockmaker\u2014turns out to be imprisonment in a large bottle where he plays his music for the amusement of the public through all eternity. \"Do not pity him, my dear,\" the Clockmaker tells Antonia, one of Paganini's murdered wives. \"He is alone with the answer for which there is no question. The saved and the damned are the same.\"\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Angelo Boscassi, ''Il Violino di Niccol\u00f2 Paganini conservato nel Palazzo Municipale di Genova'', Fratelli Pagano, 1909\n* Leopold Auer, ''Violin playing as I teach it'', Stokes, 1921 (reprint Dover, 1980)\n* Alberto Bachmann, ''An Encyclopedia of the violin'', Da Capo, 1925\n* Jeffrey Pulver, ''Paganini: The Romantic Virtuoso'', Herbert Joseph, 1936 (reprint Da Capo, 1970)\n* Geraldine I.C. de Courcy, ''Paganini the Genoese'', University of Oklahoma, 1957 (reprint Da Capo, 1977)\n* [[Yehudi Menuhin]] and [[William Primrose]], ''Violin and viola'', MacDonald and Jane's, 1976\n* Yehudi Menuhin and Curtis W.

''S.&nbsp;chamaejasme'' is a [[perennial]] plant with heads of white, pink or yellow flowers, grown as an ornamental plant in [[rock garden]]s and [[alpine house]]s.\n\n==Description==\n''Stellera chamaejasme'' is a [[herbaceous perennial]]. Unbranched stems, 20\u201330&nbsp;cm tall, emerge in a cluster from an underground [[rhizome]]. Narrow, overlapping leaves are borne along the stems. Individual leaves are narrow and pointed, up to 2&nbsp;cm long. The flowers are grouped into rounded tightly packed terminal heads. Flowers lack [[petal]]s, instead having petaloid [[sepal]]s forming a tube up to 1.5&nbsp;cm long with usually five (but possibly four or six) short lobes at the end. The flower colour varies from shades of pink and white to yellow. There are twice as many stamens as calyx lobes, in two series. The ovary has a single chamber ([[locule]]). The fruit is a dry [[drupe]], enclosed by the remains of the calyx.<ref name=Beck94/><ref name=FoC_S/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe genus ''Stellera'' was first described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1753.<ref name=IPNI_39323-1/>  He recognized two species: ''Stellera passerina'', now placed in the genus ''[[Thymelaea]]'' as ''[[Thymelaea passerina|T.&nbsp;passerina]]'', and ''Stellera chamaejasme''.<ref name=Linn53/> Many species names were later created in the genus, but all are now usually considered synonyms of other species, including ''S.&nbsp;chamaejasme'',<ref name=TPL_Stellera/> although the ''Flora of China'' states that there are 10 to 12 species.<ref name=FoC_S/>\n\nStudies in 2002 and 2009, based on [[chloroplast DNA]], placed ''Stellera'' in a small group of related genera, either as sister to ''[[Wikstroemia]]'' or embedded within it; however for most genera only one species was included.<ref name=BankFayChas02/><ref name=BeauEdwaMannMaur09/>\n\n{{clade|style=line-height:100%\n|1={{clade\n   |1=''[[Edgeworthia]]''\n   |2={{clade\n      |1={{clade\n         |1=''[[Wikstroemia]]''\n         |2=''Stellera''\n         }}\n      |2={{clade\n         |1=''[[Diarthron]]''\n         |2={{clade\n            |1=''[[Thymelaea]]''\n            |2=''[[Daphne (plant)|Daphne]]''\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   }}\n}}\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Stellera chamaejasme'' is native to northern China, Tibet, the Himalayas (Nepal, Bhutan), Uttar Pradesh in India, and Russia and Mongolia.<ref name=Beck94/><ref name=FoC_Sc/> In China, it is found on sunny dry slopes and sandy places between 2600 and 4200&nbsp;m.<ref name=FoC_Sc/>\n\n==Cultivation==\n''Stellera chamaejasme'' is cultivated as an ornamental plant in [[rock garden]]s and [[alpine house]]s. It is considered difficult to grow, needing a sunny position and gritty soil if grown outside, or a large pot if grown under cover. It is propagated by seed.<ref name=Beck94/>\n\n==Toxicity==\n[[File:Stellera chamaejasme blossoming, Longxi, Gansu, China.JPG|thumb|''Stellera chamaejasme'' (in bud) growing in [[Gansu]], Western China, where it has the common name of ''Langdu'' (\u72fc\u6bd2\u82b1) \"wolf poison\" - probably because it was formerly used for that purpose.]]\n<blockquote>The [[Russian people|Russians]] living in [[Transbaikalia|Dauria]] still hold Stellera in high esteem on account of its root, despite the fact that its violent effects have already dispatched a good many people to the afterlife. This root resembles a crudely-carved human figure to a degree even greater than that of the [ famous ] ''Alraune'' or [[Mandrake|Mandragora]], such that one can often distinguish clearly in its natural form [ protuberances resembling ] a head, arms and legs; which has led to its being given the most apposite name of ''Muzhik koren'' [ \u041c\u0443\u0436\u0438\u043a \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d ] or \"Man root\" by the Russians. The oldest rootstocks of this plant can reach the size of a large carrot, and [ if taken as medicine ] produce the most violent effects. Such old roots can produce more than fifty and sometimes as many as a hundred flowering shoots, which, crowned with their beautiful and fragrant flowers, give not the least hint of the violent and pernicious effects residing in the root that bore them. The exterior of the flower is usually of a dark reddish-purple, or, more rarely sulphur-yellow colour; while the interior is white. Add to this the fact that the flowers display, upon opening, a white border and in the middle a red or yellow patch, and the flowers present the most ravishing aspect. The young [[Evenk|Tungus]] boys are in the habit of adorning their bare heads with a kind of hat which they create most artistically by interweaving whole flowering stems of the plant. On this plant one often finds a flower in which two normal flowers seem fused into one, bearing a corolla with nine lobes and eighteen stamens arranged in two rows.

''S.&nbsp;chamaejasme'' is a [[perennial]] plant with heads of white, pink or yellow flowers, grown as an ornamental plant in [[rock garden]]s and [[alpine house]]s.\n\n==Description==\n''Stellera chamaejasme'' is a [[herbaceous perennial]]. Unbranched stems, 20\u201330&nbsp;cm tall, emerge in a cluster from an underground [[rhizome]]. Narrow, overlapping leaves are borne along the stems. Individual leaves are narrow and pointed, up to 2&nbsp;cm long. The flowers are grouped into rounded tightly packed terminal heads. Flowers lack [[petal]]s, instead having petaloid [[sepal]]s forming a tube up to 1.5&nbsp;cm long with usually five (but possibly four or six) short lobes at the end. The flower colour varies from shades of pink and white to yellow. There are twice as many stamens as calyx lobes, in two series. The ovary has a single chamber ([[locule]]). The fruit is a dry [[drupe]], enclosed by the remains of the calyx.<ref name=Beck94/><ref name=FoC_S/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe genus ''Stellera'' was first described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1753.<ref name=IPNI_39323-1/>  He recognized two species: ''Stellera passerina'', now placed in the genus ''[[Thymelaea]]'' as ''[[Thymelaea passerina|T.&nbsp;passerina]]'', and ''Stellera chamaejasme''.<ref name=Linn53/> Many species names were later created in the genus, but all are now usually considered synonyms of other species, including ''S.&nbsp;chamaejasme'',<ref name=TPL_Stellera/> although the ''Flora of China'' states that there are 10 to 12 species.<ref name=FoC_S/>\n\nStudies in 2002 and 2009, based on [[chloroplast DNA]], placed ''Stellera'' in a small group of related genera, either as sister to ''[[Wikstroemia]]'' or embedded within it; however for most genera only one species was included.<ref name=BankFayChas02/><ref name=BeauEdwaMannMaur09/>\n\n{{clade|style=line-height:100%\n|1={{clade\n   |1=''[[Edgeworthia]]''\n   |2={{clade\n      |1={{clade\n         |1=''[[Wikstroemia]]''\n         |2=''Stellera''\n         }}\n      |2={{clade\n         |1=''[[Diarthron]]''\n         |2={{clade\n            |1=''[[Thymelaea]]''\n            |2=''[[Daphne (plant)|Daphne]]''\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   }}\n}}\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Stellera chamaejasme'' is native to northern China, Tibet, the Himalayas (Nepal, Bhutan), Uttar Pradesh in India, and Russia and Mongolia.<ref name=Beck94/><ref name=FoC_Sc/> In China, it is found on sunny dry slopes and sandy places between 2600 and 4200&nbsp;m.<ref name=FoC_Sc/>\n\n==Cultivation==\n''Stellera chamaejasme'' is cultivated as an ornamental plant in [[rock garden]]s and [[alpine house]]s. It is considered difficult to grow, needing a sunny position and gritty soil if grown outside, or a large pot if grown under cover. It is propagated by seed.<ref name=Beck94/>\n\n==Toxicity==\n[[File:Stellera chamaejasme blossoming, Longxi, Gansu, China.JPG|thumb|''Stellera chamaejasme'' (in bud) growing in [[Gansu]], Western China, where it has the common name of ''Langdu'' (\u72fc\u6bd2\u82b1) \"wolf poison\" - probably because it was formerly used for that purpose.]]\n<blockquote>The [[Russian people|Russians]] living in [[Transbaikalia|Dauria]] still hold Stellera in high esteem on account of its root, despite the fact that its violent effects have already dispatched a good many people to the afterlife. This root resembles a crudely-carved human figure to a degree even greater than that of the [ famous ] ''Alraune'' or [[Mandrake|Mandragora]], such that one can often distinguish clearly in its form a head, arms and legs; which has led to its being given the most apposite name of ''Muzhik koren'' [ \u041c\u0443\u0436\u0438\u043a \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d ] or \"Man root\" by the Russians. The oldest rootstocks of this plant can reach the size of a large carrot, and [ if taken as medicine ] produce the most violent effects. Such old roots can produce more than fifty and sometimes as many as a hundred flowering shoots, which, crowned with their beautiful and fragrant flowers, give not the least hint of the violent and pernicious effects residing in the root that bore them. The exterior of the flower is usually of a dark reddish-purple, or, more rarely sulphur-yellow colour; while the interior is white. Add to this the fact that the flowers display, upon opening, a white border and in the middle a red or yellow patch, and the flowers present the most ravishing aspect. The young [[Evenk|Tungus]] boys are in the habit of adorning their bare heads with a kind of hat which they create most artistically by interweaving whole flowering stems of the plant. On this plant one often finds a flower in which two normal flowers seem fused into one, bearing a corolla with nine lobes and eighteen stamens arranged in two rows.
