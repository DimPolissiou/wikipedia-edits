According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', ''ecotour'' was first recorded in 1973 and ''ecotourism'', \"probably after ''ecotour''\", in 1982.<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM'', Version 4.0, draft entries December 2001, Oxford University Press 2009.

Tourism to areas of ecological interest (typically exotic and often threatened natural environments), esp. to support conservation efforts and observe wildlife; spec. access to an endangered environment controlled so as to have the least possible adverse effect.\n\nOne source claims the terms were used earlier. Claus-Dieter (Nick) Hetzer, an academic and adventurer from Forum International in Berkeley, CA, supposedly coined ''ecotourism'' in 1965 and ran the first ''ecotours'' in the Yucat\u00e1n during the early 1970s.<ref>David B.

The failure to acknowledge responsible, low-impact ecotourism puts legitimate ecotourism companies at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nMany environmentalists have argued for a global standard of accreditation, differentiating ecotourism companies based on their level of environmental commitment, creating a standard to follow. A national or international regulatory board would enforce accreditation procedures, with representation from various groups including governments, hotels, tour operators, travel agents, guides, airlines, local authorities, conservation organizations, and non-governmental organizations.<ref name=\"Elper-Wood\">{{cite book |last= Elper-Wood |first=M. |title=Ecotourism at a Crossroads: charting the way forward |origyear= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=1998|publisher=The final report from the Conference of Ecotourism at the Crossroads |location= Nairobi, Kenya |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |url= |quote= }}</ref> The decisions of the board would be sanctioned by governments, so that non-compliant companies would be legally required to disassociate themselves from the use of the ecotourism brand.\n\t\nCrinion suggests a Green Stars System, based on criteria including a management plan, benefit for the local community, small group interaction, education value and staff training.<ref name=\"Crinion\">{{cite book |last= Crinion |first=D. |title=South Australian tourism strategy and the role of ecotourism |origyear= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=1998|publisher=Down to Earth planning for an out-of-the-ordinary industry, presented at the South Australian Ecotourism Forum |location= Adelaide, Australia |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |url= |quote= }}</ref> Ecotourists who consider their choices would be confident of a genuine ecotourism experience when they see the higher star rating.\n\t\n[[Environmental impact assessment]]s could also be used as a form of accreditation. Feasibility is evaluated from a scientific basis, and recommendations could be made to optimally plan infrastructure, set tourist capacity, and manage the ecology. This form of accreditation is more sensitive to site specific conditions.\n\nSome countries have their own certification programs for ecotourism. Costa Rica, for example, runs the Certification of Sustainable Tourism (CST) program, which is intended to balance the effect that business has on the local environment. The CST program focuses on a company's interaction with natural and cultural resources, the improvement of quality of life within local communities, and the economic contribution to other programs of national development. CST uses a rating system that categorizes a company based upon how sustainable its operations are. CST evaluates the interaction between the company and the surrounding habitat; the management policies and operation systems within the company; how the company encourages its clients to become an active contributor towards sustainable policies; and the interaction between the company and local communities/the overall population. Based upon these criteria, the company is evaluated for the strength of its sustainability. The measurement index goes from 0 to 5, with 0 being the worst and 5 being the best.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stater|first=Adam|title=Ecotourism in Costa Rica|url=http://www.anywherecostarica.com/sustainable/cst-sustainable-tourism}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Stater|first=Adam|title=The Certification of Sustainable Tourism|url=http://www.turismo-sostenible.co.cr/en/}}</ref>\n\n===Guidelines and education===\n[[File:2017 Sarasota Adventure Kayak Guided Tour Cormorant among the Fleet 04 FRD 9405.jpg|thumb|Ecotour guide stands on a [[Kayaking|kayak]] spotting [[dolphins]] and [[manatees]], around [[Lido Key]]]]\n\nAn environmental protection strategy must address the issue of ecotourists removed from the cause-and-effect of their actions on the environment. More initiatives should be carried out to improve their awareness, sensitize them to environmental issues, and care about the places they visit.<ref name=\"Tuohino and Hynonen\"/>\n\nTour guides are an obvious and direct medium to communicate awareness. With the confidence of ecotourists and intimate knowledge of the environment, tour guides can actively discuss conservation issues. Informing ecotourists about how their actions on the trip can negatively impact their environment and the local people. A tour guide training program in Costa Rica's [[Tortuguero National Park]] has helped mitigate negative environmental impacts by providing information and regulating tourists on the parks' beaches used by nesting [[endangered sea turtles]].<ref name=\"Jacobson and Robles\">{{cite journal|last1=Jacobson|first1=Susan K.|last2=Robles|first2=Rafael|title=Ecotourism, sustainable development, and conservation education: development of a tour guide training program in Tortuguero, Costa Rica|year=1998|journal=Environmental Management|doi=10.1007/bf02645660|volume=16|issue=6|pages=701\u2013713}}</ref><ref name=\"weaver\">{{cite book|last=Weaver|first= D.

These corporations finance and profit from the development of large scale ecotourism that causes excessive environmental degradation, loss of traditional culture and way of life, and exploitation of local labor. In [[Zimbabwe]] and Nepal's Annapurna region, where underdevelopment is taking place, more than 90 percent of ecotourism revenues are expatriated to the parent countries, and less than 5 percent go into local communities.<ref name=\"Ziffer\">{{cite book |last= Ziffer |first=K. |title=Ecotourism: the uneasy alliance |origyear= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=1989|publisher=Conservation International/Ernst and Young |location= |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |url= |quote= }}</ref>\n\t\nThe lack of sustainability highlights the need for small scale, slow growth, and locally based ecotourism. Local peoples have a vested interest in the well-being of their community, and are therefore more accountable to environmental protection than multinational corporations, though they receive very little of the profits. The lack of control, westernization, adverse impacts to the environment, loss of culture and traditions outweigh the benefits of establishing large scale ecotourism. Additionally, culture loss can be attributed to cultural commodification, in which local cultures are commodified in order to make a profit.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Alison|date=2000|title=Indigenous Peoples and Ecotourism: Bringing Indigenous Knowledge and Rights into the Sustainability Equation|journal=Tourism Recreation Research|volume=25|issue=2|pages=89\u201396|doi=10.1080/02508281.2000.11014914}}</ref> \n\t\nThe increased contributions of communities to locally managed ecotourism create viable economic opportunities, including high-level management positions, and reduce environmental issues associated with poverty and unemployment. Because the ecotourism experience is marketed to a different lifestyle from large scale ecotourism, the development of facilities and infrastructure does not need to conform to corporate Western tourism standards, and can be much simpler and less expensive.<ref>{{cite book |last=Soifer |first=Jack |year=2008 |title=Entrepreneuring Sustainable Tourism |isbn=978-989-95976-0-0}}</ref> There is a greater [[Fractional-reserve banking|multiplier effect]] on the economy, because local products, materials, and labor are used.

When such investments are required, it is crucial for communities to find a company or non-governmental organization that reflects the philosophy of ecotourism; sensitive to their concerns and willing to cooperate at the expense of profit. The basic assumption of the multiplier effect is that the economy starts off with unused resources, for example, that many workers are cyclically unemployed and much of industrial capacity is sitting idle or incompletely utilized. By increasing demand in the economy, it is then possible to boost production. If the economy was already at full employment, with only structural, frictional, or other supply-side types of unemployment, any attempt to boost demand would only lead to inflation. For various laissez-faire schools of economics which embrace Say's Law and deny the possibility of Keynesian inefficiency and under-employment of resources, therefore, the multiplier concept is irrelevant or wrong-headed.\n\t\nAs an example, consider the government increasing its expenditure on roads by $1 million, without a corresponding increase in taxation. This sum would go to the road builders, who would hire more workers and distribute the money as wages and profits. The households receiving these incomes will save part of the money and spend the rest on consumer goods. These expenditures, in turn, will generate more jobs, wages, and profits, and so on with the income and spending circulating around the economy.\n\nThe multiplier effect arises because of the induced increases in consumer spending which occur due to the increased incomes \u2014 and because of the feedback into increasing business revenues, jobs, and income again. This process does not lead to an economic explosion not only because of the supply-side barriers at potential output (full employment) but because at each \"round\", the increase in consumer spending is less than the increase in consumer incomes. That is, the [[marginal propensity to consume]] (MPC) is less than one, so that each round some extra income goes into saving, leaking out of the cumulative process. Each increase in spending is thus smaller than that of the previous round, preventing an explosion.\n\n===Efforts to preserve ecosystems at risk===\nSome of the world's most exceptional biodiversity is located in the Galapagos Islands.  These islands were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1979, then added to UNESCO's List of World Heritage in Danger in 2007.  IGTOA is a non-profit dedicated to preserving this unique living laboratory against the challenges of invasive species, human impact, and tourism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.igtoa.org/travel_guide/challenges|title=Challenges Facing the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands|work=igtoa.org|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref>  For travelers who want to be mindful of the environment and the impact of tourism, it is recommended to utilize an operator that is endorsed by a reputable ecotourism organization.  In the case of the Galapagos, IGTOA has a list<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.igtoa.org/members|title=Gal\u00e1pagos Islands Travel & Tours - Conservation & Ecotourism - IGTOA|work=igtoa.org|accessdate=21 April 2017}}</ref> of the world's premiere Galapagos Islands tour companies dedicated to the lasting protection and preservation of the destination.\n\n==Natural resource management==\nNatural resource management can be utilized as a specialized tool for the development of ecotourism. There are several places throughout the world where a number of natural resources are abundant, but with human encroachment and habitats, these resources are depleting. Without the sustainable use of certain resources, they are destroyed, and floral and faunal species are becoming extinct. Ecotourism programs can be introduced for the conservation of these resources. Several plans and proper management programs can be introduced so that these resources remain untouched, and there are many organizations\u2013including nonprofits\u2013and scientists working on this field.\n\t\nNatural resources of hill areas like Kurseong in West Bengal are plenty in number with various flora and fauna, but tourism for business purpose poised the situation. Researchers from Jadavpur University are presently working in this area for the development of ecotourism to be used as a tool for natural resource management.\n\nIn Southeast Asia government and nongovernmental organizations are working together with academics and industry operators to spread the economic benefits of tourism into the kampungs and villages of the region. A recently formed alliance, the South-East Asian Tourism Organisation (SEATO), is bringing together these diverse players to discuss resource management concerns.\n\nA 2002, summit held in Quebec led to the 2008 Global Sustainable Tourism Criteria\u2013a collaborative effort between the UN Foundation and other advocacy groups. The criteria, which are voluntary, involve the following standards: \"effective sustainability planning, maximum social and economic benefits for local communities, minimum negative impacts on cultural heritage, and minimum negative impacts on the environment.\"<ref>Clarkin and K\u00e4hler, p.&nbsp;423</ref>{{full citation needed|date=May 2016}}There is no enforcing agency or system of punishments.for summit.\n\n==Criticism==\n\n===Definition===\nIn the continuum of tourism activities that stretch from conventional tourism to ecotourism, there has been a lot of contention to the limit at which biodiversity preservation, local social-economic benefits, and [[environmental impact]] can be considered \"ecotourism\". For this reason, environmentalists, special interest groups, and governments define ecotourism differently. Environmental organizations have generally insisted that ecotourism is nature-based, sustainably managed, conservation supporting, and environmentally educated.<ref name=\"Tuohino and Hynonen\"/><ref name=\"Buckley\">{{cite journal|last=Buckley|first=Ralf|title=A Framework for Ecotourism|year=1994|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|doi=10.1016/0160-7383(94)90126-0|volume=21|issue=3|pages=661\u2013665}}</ref> The [[tourist industry]] and governments, however, focus more on the product aspect, treating ecotourism as equivalent to any sort of tourism based in nature.<ref name=\"Tuohino and Hynonen\"/> As a further complication, many terms are used under the rubric of ecotourism.<ref name=\" Tuohino and Hynonen\"/> Nature tourism, low impact tourism, green tourism, bio-tourism, ecologically responsible tourism, and others have been used in literature and [[marketing]], although they are not necessarily synonymous with ecotourism.<ref name=\"Tuohino and Hynonen\"/>\n\t\nThe problems associated with defining ecotourism have often led to confusion among tourists and academics. Many problems are also subject of considerable public controversy and concern because of [[green wash]]ing, a trend towards the commercialization of tourism schemes disguised as sustainable, nature based, and [[environmentally friendly]] ecotourism.<ref name=\"Tuohino and Hynonen\"/> According to McLaren,<ref name=\"Tuohino and Hynonen\"/> these schemes are environmentally destructive, economically exploitative, and culturally insensitive at its worst.

Even if some of the guidelines are being executed, the local communities are still facing many of the negative impacts. South Africa is one of the countries that is reaping significant economic benefits from ecotourism, but the negative effects far outweigh the positive\u2014including forcing people to leave their homes, gross violations of fundamental rights, and [[environmental hazard]]s\u2014far outweigh the medium-term economic benefits.<ref name=Miller/>{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}} A tremendous amount of money and human resources continue to be used for ecotourism despite unsuccessful outcomes, and even more, money is put into public relation campaigns to dilute the effects of criticism. Ecotourism channels resources away from other projects that could contribute more sustainable and realistic solutions to pressing social and environmental problems. \"The money tourism can generate often ties parks and managements to ecotourism\".<ref>Walpole et al. 2001{{full citation needed|date=May 2016}}</ref> But there is a tension in this relationship because ecotourism often causes conflict and changes in land-use rights, fails to deliver promises of community-level benefits, damages environments, and has many other social impacts. Indeed, many argue repeatedly that ecotourism is neither ecologically nor socially beneficial, yet it persists as a strategy for conservation and development<ref name=\"West2006\" /> due to the large profits. While several studies are being done on ways to improve the ecotourism structure, some argue that these examples provide a rationale for stopping it altogether. However, there are some positive examples, among them the [[Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area]] (KAZA) and the [[Virunga National Park]], as judged by WWF.<ref>http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/ecotourism-africa-promotes-sustainable-development-and-nature-conservation Live elephants have to be worth more. In: D+C Vol42.2015:4</ref>\n\t\nThe ecotourism system exercises tremendous financial and political influence. The evidence above shows that a strong case exists for restraining such activities in certain locations. Funding could be used for field studies aimed at finding alternative solutions to tourism and the diverse problems Africa faces in result of urbanization, industrialization, and the [[overexploitation]] of agriculture.<ref name=\"Kamuaro2007\"/> At the local level, ecotourism has become a source of conflict over control of land, resources, and tourism profits. In this case, ecotourism has harmed the environment and local people and has led to conflicts over profit distribution. In a perfect world, more efforts would be made towards educating tourists of the environmental and social effects of their travels. Very few regulations or laws stand in place as boundaries for the investors in ecotourism. These should be implemented to prohibit the promotion of unsustainable ecotourism projects and materials which project false images of destinations, demeaning local and indigenous culture.\n\nThough conservation efforts in East Africa are indisputably serving the interests of tourism in the region it is important to make the distinction between conservation acts and the tourism industry.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ndaskoi|first=N.|title=The Maasai Predicament|journal=New African|year=2003|volume=419|issue=44}}</ref>   Eastern African communities are not the only of developing regions to experience economic and social harms from conservation efforts.  Conservation in the Northwest [[Yunnan]] Region of China has similarly brought drastic changes to traditional land use in the region.  Prior to logging restrictions imposed by the Chinese Government the industry made up 80 percent of the regions revenue.  Following a complete ban on commercial logging the indigenous people of the Yunnan region now see little opportunity for economic development.<ref name=\"Yunnan expedition\">{{cite video |url= http://www.snagfilms.com/films/title/the_yunnan_great_rivers_expedition |title=The Yunnan Great Rivers Expedition  |work=Snag Films |accessdate=November 29, 2012 |people=Director: Jim Norton; Writers: [[Les Guthman]], Jim Norton}}</ref>  Ecotourism may provide solutions to the economic hardships suffered from the loss of industry to conservation in the Yunnan in the same way that it may serve to remedy the difficulties faced by the Maasai.  As stated, the ecotourism structure must be improved to direct more money into host communities by reducing leakages for the industry to be successful in alleviating poverty in developing regions, but it provides a promising opportunity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Saayman|first=Melville|author2=Rossouw, Krugel|title=The impact of tourism on poverty in South Africa|journal=Development Southern Africa|date=Sep 2012|volume=29|issue=3|pages=462\u2013487|doi=10.1080/0376835x.2012.706041}}</ref>\n\n===Direct environmental impacts===\nEcotourism operations occasionally fail to live up to conservation ideals. It is sometimes overlooked that ecotourism is a highly consumer-centered activity, and that [[environmental conservation]] is a means to further [[economic growth]].<ref name=\"Kamauro\">{{cite book |last= Kamauro |first=O. |title=Ecotourism: Suicide or Development?

The lack of adequate sanitation facilities in many East African parks results in the disposal of campsite sewage in rivers, contaminating the wildlife, livestock, and people who draw drinking water from it.<ref name=\"Tuohino and Hynonen\"/>\n\t\nAside from [[environmental degradation]] with tourist infrastructure, population pressures from ecotourism also leaves behind garbage and pollution associated with the Western lifestyle.<ref name=\"McLaren\">{{cite book |last= McLaren |first=D. |title=Rethinking tourism and ecotravel: the paving of paradise and what you can do to stop it |origyear= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=1998|publisher=Kamarian Press |location=West Hartford, Connecticut, USA |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |url=https://archive.org/details/rethinkingtouris0000mcla|url-access= registration |quote= }}</ref> Although ecotourists claim to be educationally sophisticated and environmentally concerned, they rarely understand the ecological consequences of their visits and how their day-to-day activities append physical impacts on the environment. As one scientist observes, they \"rarely acknowledge how the meals they eat, the toilets they flush, the water they drink, and so on, are all part of broader regional economic and ecological systems they are helping to reconfigure with their very activities.\"<ref name=\"Tuohino and Hynonen\"/> Nor do ecotourists recognize the great consumption of non-renewable energy required to arrive at their destination, which is typically more remote than conventional tourism destinations. For instance, an exotic journey to a place 10,000 kilometers away consumes about 700 liters of fuel per person.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.enn.com/today.html?id=12778|title=Travel Experts See Worrisome Downside to Ecotourism|author=Mellgren, Doug|agency=Associated Press|date=2007-05-16|accessdate=2007-05-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520154849/http://www.enn.com/today.html?id=12778|archive-date=2007-05-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\t\nEcotourism activities are, in and of themselves, issues in environmental impact because they may disturb fauna and flora. Ecotourists believe that because they are only taking pictures and leaving footprints, they keep ecotourism sites pristine, but even harmless-sounding activities such as nature hikes can be ecologically destructive. In the [[Annapurna]] Circuit in Nepal, ecotourists have worn down the marked trails and created alternate routes, contributing to [[soil impaction]], erosion, and plant damage.<ref name=\" Tuohino and Hynonen\"/> Where the ecotourism activity involves wildlife viewing, it can scare away animals, disrupt their feeding and nesting sites,<ref name=\"Tuohino and Hynonen\"/> or acclimate them to the presence of people.<ref name=\"Tuohino and Hynonen\"/> In Kenya, wildlife-observer disruption drives cheetahs off their reserves, increasing the risk of inbreeding and further endangering the species.<ref name=\"Tuohino and Hynonen\"/>\n\n===Environmental hazards===\nThe [[industrialization]], [[urbanization]] and [[agriculture|agricultural]] practices of human society are having a serious impact on the environment. Ecotourism is now also considered to be playing a role in environmental depletion including [[deforestation]], disruption of ecological life systems and various forms of [[pollution]], all of which contribute to [[environmental degradation]]. For example, the number of motor vehicles crossing a park increases as tour drivers search for rare species. The number of roads disrupts the grass cover, which has serious consequences on plant and animal species. These areas also have a higher rate of [[ecological disturbance|disturbances]] and [[invasive species]] due to increasing [[environmental impact of transport|traffic]] off of the beaten path into new, undiscovered areas.<ref name=\"Kamuaro2007\">{{cite web|last1=Kamuaro|first1=Ole|title=Ecotourism: suicide or development?|url=https://www.un-ngls.org/orf/documents/publications.en/voices.africa/number6/vfa6.12.htm|website=Voices from Africa|publisher=United Nations Non-Governmental Liaison Service|accessdate=17 November 2017|date=2007}}</ref> Ecotourism also has an effect on species through the value placed on them. \"Certain species have gone from being little known or valued by local people to being highly valued commodities. The [[commodification of nature|commodification of plants]] may erase their social value and lead to [[overproduction]] within protected areas. Local people and their images can also be turned into commodities\".<ref name=\"West2006\">{{cite book|last1=West|first1=Paige|title=Conservation is our government now : the politics of ecology in Papua New Guinea|date=2006|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|isbn=978-0822337492|edition=2nd}}</ref> Kamuaro points out the relatively obvious contradiction that any commercial venture into unspoiled, pristine land inevitably means a higher pressure on the environment.<ref name=\"Kamuaro2007\" />\n\n===Local people===\nMost forms of ecotourism are owned by foreign investors and corporations that provide few benefits to the local people. An overwhelming majority of profits are put into the pockets of investors instead of reinvestment into the local economy or environmental protection leading to further environmental degradation. The limited numbers of local people who are employed in the economy enter at its lowest level and are unable to live in tourist areas because of meager wages and a two-market system.<ref name=\"Tuohino and Hynonen\"/>\n\nIn some cases, the resentment by local people results in environmental degradation. As a highly publicized case, the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] nomads in Kenya killed wildlife in national parks but are now helping the national park to save the wildlife to show aversion to unfair compensation terms and displacement from traditional lands.<ref name=\"Cater\"/> The lack of economic opportunities for local people also constrains them to degrade the environment as a means of sustenance.<ref name=\"Tuohino and Hynonen\"/> The presence of affluent ecotourists encourage the development of destructive markets in wildlife souvenirs, such as the sale of coral trinkets on tropical islands and animal products in Asia, contributing to illegal harvesting and [[poaching]] from the environment. In [[Suriname]], sea turtle reserves use a very large portion of their budget to guard against these destructive activities.\n\n===Displacement of people===\nOne of the worst examples of communities being moved in order to create a park is the story of the [[Maasai people|Maasai]]. About 70% of national parks and game reserves in East Africa are on Maasai land.<ref name=\"Kamuaro2007\"/> The first negative impact of tourism was the land lost from the Maasai culture. Local and national governments took advantage of the Maasai's ignorance on the situation and robbed them of huge chunks of grazing land, putting to risk their only socio-economic livelihood. In Kenya, the Maasai also have not gained any economic benefits. Despite the loss of their land, employment favors better-educated workers. Furthermore, the investors in this area are not local and have not put any profits back into the local economy. In some cases, [[game reserve]]s can be created without informing or consulting the local people. They only find out when an [[eviction]] notice is delivered.<ref name=\"Kamuaro2007\"/> Another source of resentment is the manipulation of the local people by their government. \"Eco-tourism works to create simplistic images of local people and their uses and understandings of their surroundings. Through the lens of these simplified images, officials direct policies and projects towards the local people and the local people are blamed if the projects fail\" (West, 2006). Clearly, tourism as a trade is not empowering the local people who make it rich and satisfying. Instead, ecotourism exploits and depletes, particularly in African Maasai tribes. It has to be reoriented if it is to be useful to local communities and to become sustainable.<ref name=\"Kamuaro2007\"/>\n\n===Threats to indigenous cultures===\nEcotourism often claims that it preserves and \"enhances\" local cultures. Evidence shows that with the establishment of protected areas local people have illegally lost their homes, and mostly with no compensation.<ref name=\"Kamuaro2007\"/> Pushing people onto marginal lands with harsh climates, poor soils, lack of water, and infested with livestock and disease does little to enhance livelihoods even when a proportion of ecotourism profits are directed back into the community. The establishment of parks can create harsh survival realities and deprive the people of their traditional use of land and natural resources. Ethnic groups are increasingly being seen as a \"backdrop\" to the scenery and wildlife. The local people struggle for cultural survival and freedom of cultural expression while being \"observed\" by tourists. Local indigenous people also have a strong resentment towards the change, \"Tourism has been allowed to develop with virtually no controls. Too many lodges have been built, too much firewood is being used and no limits are being placed on tourism vehicles. They regularly drive off-track and harass the wildlife. Their vehicle tracks criss-cross the entire Masai Mara. Inevitably [[the bush]] is becoming [[erosion|eroded]] and [[land degradation|degraded]]\".<ref name=\"Kamuaro2007\"/>\n\n===Mismanagement===\nWhile governments are typically entrusted with the administration and enforcement of environmental protection, they often lack the commitment or capability to manage ecotourism sites. The regulations for environmental protection may be vaguely defined, costly to implement, hard to enforce, and uncertain in effectiveness.<ref name=\"Baumol and Oates\">{{cite book |author1=Baumol, W.J. |author2=W.E. Oates |title=Economics, environmental policy, and quality of life |origyear= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=1977|publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, USA |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |url= |quote= }}</ref> Government regulatory agencies, are susceptible to making decisions that spend on politically beneficial but environmentally unproductive projects. Because of prestige and conspicuousness, the construction of an attractive visitor's center at an ecotourism site may take precedence over more pressing environmental concerns like acquiring habitat, protecting endemic species, and removing invasive ones.<ref name=\" Tuohino and Hynonen\"/> Finally, influential groups can [[lobbying|pressure, and sway]] the interests of the government to their favor. The government and its regulators can become vested in the benefits of the ecotourism industry which they are supposed to regulate, causing restrictive environmental regulations and enforcement to become more lenient.\n\t\nManagement of ecotourism sites by private ecotourism companies offers an alternative to the cost of regulation and deficiency of government agencies. It is believed that these companies have a self-interest in limited environmental degradation because tourists will pay more for pristine environments, which translates to higher profit. However, theory indicates that this practice is not economically feasible and will fail to manage the environment.\n\nThe model of [[monopolistic competition]] states that distinctiveness will entail profits, but profits will promote imitation. A company that protects its ecotourism sites is able to charge a premium for the novel experience and pristine environment. But when other companies view the success of this approach, they also enter the market with similar practices, increasing competition and reducing demand. Eventually, the demand will be reduced until the economic profit is zero. A cost-benefit analysis shows that the company bears the cost of environmental protection without receiving the gains. Without economic incentive, the whole premise of self-interest through environmental protection is quashed; instead, ecotourism companies will minimize environment related expenses and maximize tourism demand.<ref name=\"Tuohino and Hynonen\"/>\n\nThe [[tragedy of the commons]] offers another model for economic unsustainability from environmental protection, in ecotourism sites utilized by many companies.<ref name=\"Hardin\">{{cite journal|last=Hardin|first=Garrett|title=The Tragedy of the Commons|year=1968|journal=Science|doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243|pmid=17756331|volume=162|issue=3859|pages=1243\u20131248|bibcode=1968Sci...162.1243H|doi-access=free}}</ref> Although there is a communal incentive to protect the environment, maximizing the benefits in the long run, a company will conclude that it is in their best interest to utilize the ecotourism site beyond its sustainable level. By increasing the number of ecotourists, for instance, a company gains all the economic benefit while paying only a part of the environmental cost. In the same way, a company recognizes that there is no incentive to actively protect the environment; they bear all the costs, while the benefits are shared by all other companies. The result, again, is mismanagement.\n\nTaken together, the mobility of foreign investment and lack of economic incentive for environmental protection means that ecotourism companies are disposed to establishing themselves in new sites once their existing one is sufficiently degraded.\n\nIn addition, the systematic literature review conducted by Cabral and Dhar (2019) have identified several challenges due to slow progression of ecotourism initiatives such as (a) economic leakages, (b) lack of government involvement, (c) skill deficiency among the local communities,  (d) absence of disseminating environmental education, (e) sporadic increase in pollution, (f) conflict between tourism management personnel and local communities and (g) inadequate infrastructure development.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cabral|first=Clement|last2=Dhar|first2=Rajib Lochan|date=2019-06-10|title=Ecotourism research in India: from an integrative literature review to a future research framework|journal=Journal of Ecotourism|volume=0|pages=1\u201327|doi=10.1080/14724049.2019.1625359|issn=1472-4049}}</ref>\n\n===Case studies===\nThe purpose of ecotourism is to engage tourists in low impact, non-consumptive and locally oriented environments in order to maintain species and habitats \u2014 especially in underdeveloped regions.  While some ecotourism projects, including some found in the United States, can support such claims, many projects have failed to address some of the fundamental issues that nations face in the first place.

According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', ''ecotour'' was first recorded in 1973 and ''ecotourism'', \"probably after ''ecotour''\", in 1982.<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM'', Version 4.0, draft entries December 2001, Oxford University Press 2009.

Tourism to areas of ecological interest (typically exotic and often threatened natural environments), esp. to support conservation efforts and observe wildlife; spec. access to an endangered environment controlled so as to have the least possible adverse effect.\n\nOne source claims the terms were used earlier. Claus-Dieter (Nick) Hetzer, an academic and adventurer from Forum International in Berkeley, CA, supposedly coined ''ecotourism'' in 1965 and ran the first ''ecotours'' in the Yucat\u00e1n during the early 1970s.<ref>David B.

The failure to acknowledge responsible, low-impact ecotourism puts legitimate ecotourism companies at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nMany environmentalists have argued for a global standard of accreditation, differentiating ecotourism companies based on their level of environmental commitment, creating a standard to follow. A national or international regulatory board would enforce accreditation procedures, with representation from various groups including governments, hotels, tour operators, travel agents, guides, airlines, local authorities, conservation organizations, and non-governmental organizations.<ref name=\"Elper-Wood\">{{cite book |last= Elper-Wood |first=M. |title=Ecotourism at a Crossroads: charting the way forward |origyear= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=1998|publisher=The final report from the Conference of Ecotourism at the Crossroads |location= Nairobi, Kenya |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |url= |quote= }}</ref> The decisions of the board would be sanctioned by governments, so that non-compliant companies would be legally required to disassociate themselves from the use of the ecotourism brand.\n\t\nCrinion suggests a Green Stars System, based on criteria including a management plan, benefit for the local community, small group interaction, education value and staff training.<ref name=\"Crinion\">{{cite book |last= Crinion |first=D. |title=South Australian tourism strategy and the role of ecotourism |origyear= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=1998|publisher=Down to Earth planning for an out-of-the-ordinary industry, presented at the South Australian Ecotourism Forum |location= Adelaide, Australia |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |url= |quote= }}</ref> Ecotourists who consider their choices would be confident of a genuine ecotourism experience when they see the higher star rating.\n\t\n[[Environmental impact assessment]]s could also be used as a form of accreditation. Feasibility is evaluated from a scientific basis, and recommendations could be made to optimally plan infrastructure, set tourist capacity, and manage the ecology. This form of accreditation is more sensitive to site specific conditions.\n\nSome countries have their own certification programs for ecotourism. Costa Rica, for example, runs the Certification of Sustainable Tourism (CST) program, which is intended to balance the effect that business has on the local environment. The CST program focuses on a company's interaction with natural and cultural resources, the improvement of quality of life within local communities, and the economic contribution to other programs of national development. CST uses a rating system that categorizes a company based upon how sustainable its operations are. CST evaluates the interaction between the company and the surrounding habitat; the management policies and operation systems within the company; how the company encourages its clients to become an active contributor towards sustainable policies; and the interaction between the company and local communities/the overall population. Based upon these criteria, the company is evaluated for the strength of its sustainability. The measurement index goes from 0 to 5, with 0 being the worst and 5 being the best.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stater|first=Adam|title=Ecotourism in Costa Rica|url=http://www.anywherecostarica.com/sustainable/cst-sustainable-tourism}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Stater|first=Adam|title=The Certification of Sustainable Tourism|url=http://www.turismo-sostenible.co.cr/en/}}</ref>\n\n===Guidelines and education===\n[[File:2017 Sarasota Adventure Kayak Guided Tour Cormorant among the Fleet 04 FRD 9405.jpg|thumb|Ecotour guide stands on a [[Kayaking|kayak]] spotting [[dolphins]] and [[manatees]], around [[Lido Key]]]]\n\nAn environmental protection strategy must address the issue of ecotourists removed from the cause-and-effect of their actions on the environment. More initiatives should be carried out to improve their awareness, sensitize them to environmental issues, and care about the places they visit.<ref name=\"Tuohino and Hynonen\"/>\n\nTour guides are an obvious and direct medium to communicate awareness. With the confidence of ecotourists and intimate knowledge of the environment, tour guides can actively discuss conservation issues. Informing ecotourists about how their actions on the trip can negatively impact their environment and the local people. A tour guide training program in Costa Rica's [[Tortuguero National Park]] has helped mitigate negative environmental impacts by providing information and regulating tourists on the parks' beaches used by nesting [[endangered sea turtles]].<ref name=\"Jacobson and Robles\">{{cite journal|last1=Jacobson|first1=Susan K.|last2=Robles|first2=Rafael|title=Ecotourism, sustainable development, and conservation education: development of a tour guide training program in Tortuguero, Costa Rica|year=1998|journal=Environmental Management|doi=10.1007/bf02645660|volume=16|issue=6|pages=701\u2013713}}</ref><ref name=\"weaver\">{{cite book|last=Weaver|first= D.

These corporations finance and profit from the development of large scale ecotourism that causes excessive environmental degradation, loss of traditional culture and way of life, and exploitation of local labor. In [[Zimbabwe]] and Nepal's Annapurna region, where underdevelopment is taking place, more than 90 percent of ecotourism revenues are expatriated to the parent countries, and less than 5 percent go into local communities.<ref name=\"Ziffer\">{{cite book |last= Ziffer |first=K. |title=Ecotourism: the uneasy alliance |origyear= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=1989|publisher=Conservation International/Ernst and Young |location= |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |url= |quote= }}</ref>\n\t\nThe lack of sustainability highlights the need for small scale, slow growth, and locally based ecotourism. Local peoples have a vested interest in the well-being of their community, and are therefore more accountable to environmental protection than multinational corporations, though they receive very little of the profits. The lack of control, westernization, adverse impacts to the environment, loss of culture and traditions outweigh the benefits of establishing large scale ecotourism. Additionally, culture loss can be attributed to cultural commodification, in which local cultures are commodified in order to make a profit.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Alison|date=2000|title=Indigenous Peoples and Ecotourism: Bringing Indigenous Knowledge and Rights into the Sustainability Equation|journal=Tourism Recreation Research|volume=25|issue=2|pages=89\u201396|doi=10.1080/02508281.2000.11014914}}</ref> \n\t\nThe increased contributions of communities to locally managed ecotourism create viable economic opportunities, including high-level management positions, and reduce environmental issues associated with poverty and unemployment. Because the ecotourism experience is marketed to a different lifestyle from large scale ecotourism, the development of facilities and infrastructure does not need to conform to corporate Western tourism standards, and can be much simpler and less expensive.<ref>{{cite book |last=Soifer |first=Jack |year=2008 |title=Entrepreneuring Sustainable Tourism |isbn=978-989-95976-0-0}}</ref> There is a greater [[Fractional-reserve banking|multiplier effect]] on the economy, because local products, materials, and labor are used.

Lowman |title=Ecotourism in the third world\u2014problems and prospects for sustainability, in Ecotourism: a sustainable option? |origyear= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=1994|publisher= John Wiley and Sons |location= United Kingdom |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |url= |quote= }}</ref> The Great Barrier Reef Park in Australia reported over half of a billion dollars of indirect income in the area and added thousands of indirect jobs between 2004 and 2005.<ref name=\"weaver\"/> However, even this form of tourism may require foreign investment for promotion or start up. When such investments are required, it is crucial for communities to find a company or non-governmental organization that reflects the philosophy of ecotourism; sensitive to their concerns and willing to cooperate at the expense of profit. The basic assumption of the multiplier effect is that the economy starts off with unused resources, for example, that many workers are cyclically unemployed and much of industrial capacity is sitting idle or incompletely utilized. By increasing demand in the economy, it is then possible to boost production. If the economy was already at full employment, with only structural, frictional, or other supply-side types of unemployment, any attempt to boost demand would only lead to inflation. For various laissez-faire schools of economics which embrace Say's Law and deny the possibility of Keynesian inefficiency and under-employment of resources, therefore, the multiplier concept is irrelevant or wrong-headed.\n\t\nAs an example, consider the government increasing its expenditure on roads by $1 million, without a corresponding increase in taxation. This sum would go to the road builders, who would hire more workers and distribute the money as wages and profits. The households receiving these incomes will save part of the money and spend the rest on consumer goods. These expenditures, in turn, will generate more jobs, wages, and profits, and so on with the income and spending circulating around the economy.\n\nThe multiplier effect arises because of the induced increases in consumer spending which occur due to the increased incomes \u2014 and because of the feedback into increasing business revenues, jobs, and income again. This process does not lead to an economic explosion not only because of the supply-side barriers at potential output (full employment) but because at each \"round\", the increase in consumer spending is less than the increase in consumer incomes. That is, the [[marginal propensity to consume]] (MPC) is less than one, so that each round some extra income goes into saving, leaking out of the cumulative process. Each increase in spending is thus smaller than that of the previous round, preventing an explosion.\n\n===Efforts to preserve ecosystems at risk===\nSome of the world's most exceptional biodiversity is located in the Galapagos Islands.  These islands were designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1979, then added to UNESCO's List of World Heritage in Danger in 2007.  IGTOA is a non-profit dedicated to preserving this unique living laboratory against the challenges of invasive species, human impact, and tourism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.igtoa.org/travel_guide/challenges|title=Challenges Facing the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands|work=igtoa.org|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref>  For travelers who want to be mindful of the environment and the impact of tourism, it is recommended to utilize an operator that is endorsed by a reputable ecotourism organization.  In the case of the Galapagos, IGTOA has a list<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.igtoa.org/members|title=Gal\u00e1pagos Islands Travel & Tours - Conservation & Ecotourism - IGTOA|work=igtoa.org|accessdate=21 April 2017}}</ref> of the world's premiere Galapagos Islands tour companies dedicated to the lasting protection and preservation of the destination.\n\n==Natural resource management==\nNatural resource management can be utilized as a specialized tool for the development of ecotourism. There are several places throughout the world where a number of natural resources are abundant, but with human encroachment and habitats, these resources are depleting. Without the sustainable use of certain resources, they are destroyed, and floral and faunal species are becoming extinct. Ecotourism programs can be introduced for the conservation of these resources. Several plans and proper management programs can be introduced so that these resources remain untouched, and there are many organizations\u2013including nonprofits\u2013and scientists working on this field.\n\t\nNatural resources of hill areas like Kurseong in West Bengal are plenty in number with various flora and fauna, but tourism for business purpose poised the situation. Researchers from Jadavpur University are presently working in this area for the development of ecotourism to be used as a tool for natural resource management.\n\nIn Southeast Asia government and nongovernmental organizations are working together with academics and industry operators to spread the economic benefits of tourism into the kampungs and villages of the region. A recently formed alliance, the South-East Asian Tourism Organisation (SEATO), is bringing together these diverse players to discuss resource management concerns.\n\nA 2002, summit held in Quebec led to the 2008 Global Sustainable Tourism Criteria\u2013a collaborative effort between the UN Foundation and other advocacy groups. The criteria, which are voluntary, involve the following standards: \"effective sustainability planning, maximum social and economic benefits for local communities, minimum negative impacts on cultural heritage, and minimum negative impacts on the environment.\"<ref>Clarkin and K\u00e4hler, p.&nbsp;423</ref>{{full citation needed|date=May 2016}}There is no enforcing agency or system of punishments.for summit.\n\n==Criticism==\n\n===Definition===\nIn the continuum of tourism activities that stretch from conventional tourism to ecotourism, there has been a lot of contention to the limit at which biodiversity preservation, local social-economic benefits, and [[environmental impact]] can be considered \"ecotourism\". For this reason, environmentalists, special interest groups, and governments define ecotourism differently. Environmental organizations have generally insisted that ecotourism is nature-based, sustainably managed, conservation supporting, and environmentally educated.<ref name=\"Tuohino and Hynonen\"/><ref name=\"Buckley\">{{cite journal|last=Buckley|first=Ralf|title=A Framework for Ecotourism|year=1994|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|doi=10.1016/0160-7383(94)90126-0|volume=21|issue=3|pages=661\u2013665}}</ref> The [[tourist industry]] and governments, however, focus more on the product aspect, treating ecotourism as equivalent to any sort of tourism based in nature.<ref name=\"Tuohino and Hynonen\"/> As a further complication, many terms are used under the rubric of ecotourism.<ref name=\" Tuohino and Hynonen\"/> Nature tourism, low impact tourism, green tourism, bio-tourism, ecologically responsible tourism, and others have been used in literature and [[marketing]], although they are not necessarily synonymous with ecotourism.<ref name=\"Tuohino and Hynonen\"/>\n\t\nThe problems associated with defining ecotourism have often led to confusion among tourists and academics. Many problems are also subject of considerable public controversy and concern because of [[green wash]]ing, a trend towards the commercialization of tourism schemes disguised as sustainable, nature based, and [[environmentally friendly]] ecotourism.<ref name=\"Tuohino and Hynonen\"/> According to McLaren,<ref name=\"Tuohino and Hynonen\"/> these schemes are environmentally destructive, economically exploitative, and culturally insensitive at its worst. They are also morally disconcerting because they mislead tourists and manipulate their concerns for the environment.<ref name=\"Barkin\">{{cite book |last= Bar kin |first=D. |title=Eco tourism for sustainable regional development |origyear= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=2002|publisher=Current Issues in Tourism |location= |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages='''5'''(3\u20134):245\u2013253 |chapter= |url= |quote= }}</ref> The development and success of such large scale, energy intensive, and ecologically unsustainable schemes are a testament to the tremendous profits associated with being labeled as ecotourism.\n\n===Negative impact===\nEcotourism has become one of the fastest-growing sectors of the tourism industry, growing annually by 10\u201315% worldwide.<ref name=Miller>Miller, 2007</ref>{{full citation needed|date=May 2016}} One definition of ecotourism is \"the practice of low-impact, educational, ecologically and culturally sensitive travel that benefits local communities and host countries\".<ref name=\"Honey EandSD\"/>{{rp|71}} Many of the ecotourism projects are not meeting these standards. Even if some of the guidelines are being executed, the local communities are still facing many of the negative impacts. South Africa is one of the countries that is reaping significant economic benefits from ecotourism, but the negative effects far outweigh the positive\u2014including forcing people to leave their homes, gross violations of fundamental rights, and [[environmental hazard]]s\u2014far outweigh the medium-term economic benefits.<ref name=Miller/>{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}} A tremendous amount of money and human resources continue to be used for ecotourism despite unsuccessful outcomes, and even more, money is put into public relation campaigns to dilute the effects of criticism. Ecotourism channels resources away from other projects that could contribute more sustainable and realistic solutions to pressing social and environmental problems. \"The money tourism can generate often ties parks and managements to ecotourism\".<ref>Walpole et al. 2001{{full citation needed|date=May 2016}}</ref> But there is a tension in this relationship because ecotourism often causes conflict and changes in land-use rights, fails to deliver promises of community-level benefits, damages environments, and has many other social impacts. Indeed, many argue repeatedly that ecotourism is neither ecologically nor socially beneficial, yet it persists as a strategy for conservation and development<ref name=\"West2006\" /> due to the large profits. While several studies are being done on ways to improve the ecotourism structure, some argue that these examples provide a rationale for stopping it altogether. However, there are some positive examples, among them the [[Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area]] (KAZA) and the [[Virunga National Park]], as judged by WWF.<ref>http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/ecotourism-africa-promotes-sustainable-development-and-nature-conservation Live elephants have to be worth more. In: D+C Vol42.2015:4</ref>\n\t\nThe ecotourism system exercises tremendous financial and political influence. The evidence above shows that a strong case exists for restraining such activities in certain locations. Funding could be used for field studies aimed at finding alternative solutions to tourism and the diverse problems Africa faces in result of urbanization, industrialization, and the [[overexploitation]] of agriculture.<ref name=\"Kamuaro2007\"/> At the local level, ecotourism has become a source of conflict over control of land, resources, and tourism profits. In this case, ecotourism has harmed the environment and local people and has led to conflicts over profit distribution. In a perfect world, more efforts would be made towards educating tourists of the environmental and social effects of their travels. Very few regulations or laws stand in place as boundaries for the investors in ecotourism. These should be implemented to prohibit the promotion of unsustainable ecotourism projects and materials which project false images of destinations, demeaning local and indigenous culture.\n\nThough conservation efforts in East Africa are indisputably serving the interests of tourism in the region it is important to make the distinction between conservation acts and the tourism industry.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ndaskoi|first=N.|title=The Maasai Predicament|journal=New African|year=2003|volume=419|issue=44}}</ref>   Eastern African communities are not the only of developing regions to experience economic and social harms from conservation efforts.  Conservation in the Northwest [[Yunnan]] Region of China has similarly brought drastic changes to traditional land use in the region.

For instance, an exotic journey to a place 10,000 kilometers away consumes about 700 liters of fuel per person.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.enn.com/today.html?id=12778|title=Travel Experts See Worrisome Downside to Ecotourism|author=Mellgren, Doug|agency=Associated Press|date=2007-05-16|accessdate=2007-05-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520154849/http://www.enn.com/today.html?id=12778|archive-date=2007-05-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\t\nEcotourism activities are, in and of themselves, issues in environmental impact because they may disturb fauna and flora. Ecotourists believe that because they are only taking pictures and leaving footprints, they keep ecotourism sites pristine, but even harmless-sounding activities such as nature hikes can be ecologically destructive. In the [[Annapurna]] Circuit in Nepal, ecotourists have worn down the marked trails and created alternate routes, contributing to [[soil impaction]], erosion, and plant damage.<ref name=\" Tuohino and Hynonen\"/> Where the ecotourism activity involves wildlife viewing, it can scare away animals, disrupt their feeding and nesting sites,<ref name=\"Tuohino and Hynonen\"/> or acclimate them to the presence of people.<ref name=\"Tuohino and Hynonen\"/> In Kenya, wildlife-observer disruption drives cheetahs off their reserves, increasing the risk of inbreeding and further endangering the species.<ref name=\"Tuohino and Hynonen\"/>\n\n===Environmental hazards===\nThe [[industrialization]], [[urbanization]] and [[agriculture|agricultural]] practices of human society are having a serious impact on the environment. Ecotourism is now also considered to be playing a role in environmental depletion including [[deforestation]], disruption of ecological life systems and various forms of [[pollution]], all of which contribute to [[environmental degradation]]. For example, the number of motor vehicles crossing a park increases as tour drivers search for rare species. The number of roads disrupts the grass cover, which has serious consequences on plant and animal species. These areas also have a higher rate of [[ecological disturbance|disturbances]] and [[invasive species]] due to increasing [[environmental impact of transport|traffic]] off of the beaten path into new, undiscovered areas.<ref name=\"Kamuaro2007\">{{cite web|last1=Kamuaro|first1=Ole|title=Ecotourism: suicide or development?|url=https://www.un-ngls.org/orf/documents/publications.en/voices.africa/number6/vfa6.12.htm|website=Voices from Africa|publisher=United Nations Non-Governmental Liaison Service|accessdate=17 November 2017|date=2007}}</ref> Ecotourism also has an effect on species through the value placed on them. \"Certain species have gone from being little known or valued by local people to being highly valued commodities. The [[commodification of nature|commodification of plants]] may erase their social value and lead to [[overproduction]] within protected areas. Local people and their images can also be turned into commodities\".<ref name=\"West2006\">{{cite book|last1=West|first1=Paige|title=Conservation is our government now : the politics of ecology in Papua New Guinea|date=2006|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|isbn=978-0822337492|edition=2nd}}</ref> Kamuaro points out the relatively obvious contradiction that any commercial venture into unspoiled, pristine land inevitably means a higher pressure on the environment.<ref name=\"Kamuaro2007\" />\n\n===Local people===\nMost forms of ecotourism are owned by foreign investors and corporations that provide few benefits to the local people. An overwhelming majority of profits are put into the pockets of investors instead of reinvestment into the local economy or environmental protection leading to further environmental degradation. The limited numbers of local people who are employed in the economy enter at its lowest level and are unable to live in tourist areas because of meager wages and a two-market system.<ref name=\"Tuohino and Hynonen\"/>\n\nIn some cases, the resentment by local people results in environmental degradation. As a highly publicized case, the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] nomads in Kenya killed wildlife in national parks but are now helping the national park to save the wildlife to show aversion to unfair compensation terms and displacement from traditional lands.<ref name=\"Cater\"/> The lack of economic opportunities for local people also constrains them to degrade the environment as a means of sustenance.<ref name=\"Tuohino and Hynonen\"/> The presence of affluent ecotourists encourage the development of destructive markets in wildlife souvenirs, such as the sale of coral trinkets on tropical islands and animal products in Asia, contributing to illegal harvesting and [[poaching]] from the environment. In [[Suriname]], sea turtle reserves use a very large portion of their budget to guard against these destructive activities.\n\n===Displacement of people===\nOne of the worst examples of communities being moved in order to create a park is the story of the [[Maasai people|Maasai]]. About 70% of national parks and game reserves in East Africa are on Maasai land.<ref name=\"Kamuaro2007\"/> The first negative impact of tourism was the land lost from the Maasai culture. Local and national governments took advantage of the Maasai's ignorance on the situation and robbed them of huge chunks of grazing land, putting to risk their only socio-economic livelihood. In Kenya, the Maasai also have not gained any economic benefits. Despite the loss of their land, employment favors better-educated workers. Furthermore, the investors in this area are not local and have not put any profits back into the local economy. In some cases, [[game reserve]]s can be created without informing or consulting the local people. They only find out when an [[eviction]] notice is delivered.<ref name=\"Kamuaro2007\"/> Another source of resentment is the manipulation of the local people by their government. \"Eco-tourism works to create simplistic images of local people and their uses and understandings of their surroundings. Through the lens of these simplified images, officials direct policies and projects towards the local people and the local people are blamed if the projects fail\" (West, 2006). Clearly, tourism as a trade is not empowering the local people who make it rich and satisfying. Instead, ecotourism exploits and depletes, particularly in African Maasai tribes. It has to be reoriented if it is to be useful to local communities and to become sustainable.<ref name=\"Kamuaro2007\"/>\n\n===Threats to indigenous cultures===\nEcotourism often claims that it preserves and \"enhances\" local cultures. Evidence shows that with the establishment of protected areas local people have illegally lost their homes, and mostly with no compensation.<ref name=\"Kamuaro2007\"/> Pushing people onto marginal lands with harsh climates, poor soils, lack of water, and infested with livestock and disease does little to enhance livelihoods even when a proportion of ecotourism profits are directed back into the community. The establishment of parks can create harsh survival realities and deprive the people of their traditional use of land and natural resources. Ethnic groups are increasingly being seen as a \"backdrop\" to the scenery and wildlife. The local people struggle for cultural survival and freedom of cultural expression while being \"observed\" by tourists. Local indigenous people also have a strong resentment towards the change, \"Tourism has been allowed to develop with virtually no controls. Too many lodges have been built, too much firewood is being used and no limits are being placed on tourism vehicles. They regularly drive off-track and harass the wildlife. Their vehicle tracks criss-cross the entire Masai Mara. Inevitably [[the bush]] is becoming [[erosion|eroded]] and [[land degradation|degraded]]\".<ref name=\"Kamuaro2007\"/>\n\n===Mismanagement===\nWhile governments are typically entrusted with the administration and enforcement of environmental protection, they often lack the commitment or capability to manage ecotourism sites. The regulations for environmental protection may be vaguely defined, costly to implement, hard to enforce, and uncertain in effectiveness.<ref name=\"Baumol and Oates\">{{cite book |author1=Baumol, W.J. |author2=W.E. Oates |title=Economics, environmental policy, and quality of life |origyear= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=1977|publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, USA |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |url= |quote= }}</ref> Government regulatory agencies, are susceptible to making decisions that spend on politically beneficial but environmentally unproductive projects. Because of prestige and conspicuousness, the construction of an attractive visitor's center at an ecotourism site may take precedence over more pressing environmental concerns like acquiring habitat, protecting endemic species, and removing invasive ones.<ref name=\" Tuohino and Hynonen\"/> Finally, influential groups can [[lobbying|pressure, and sway]] the interests of the government to their favor. The government and its regulators can become vested in the benefits of the ecotourism industry which they are supposed to regulate, causing restrictive environmental regulations and enforcement to become more lenient.\n\t\nManagement of ecotourism sites by private ecotourism companies offers an alternative to the cost of regulation and deficiency of government agencies. It is believed that these companies have a self-interest in limited environmental degradation because tourists will pay more for pristine environments, which translates to higher profit. However, theory indicates that this practice is not economically feasible and will fail to manage the environment.\n\nThe model of [[monopolistic competition]] states that distinctiveness will entail profits, but profits will promote imitation. A company that protects its ecotourism sites is able to charge a premium for the novel experience and pristine environment. But when other companies view the success of this approach, they also enter the market with similar practices, increasing competition and reducing demand. Eventually, the demand will be reduced until the economic profit is zero. A cost-benefit analysis shows that the company bears the cost of environmental protection without receiving the gains. Without economic incentive, the whole premise of self-interest through environmental protection is quashed; instead, ecotourism companies will minimize environment related expenses and maximize tourism demand.<ref name=\"Tuohino and Hynonen\"/>\n\nThe [[tragedy of the commons]] offers another model for economic unsustainability from environmental protection, in ecotourism sites utilized by many companies.<ref name=\"Hardin\">{{cite journal|last=Hardin|first=Garrett|title=The Tragedy of the Commons|year=1968|journal=Science|doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243|pmid=17756331|volume=162|issue=3859|pages=1243\u20131248|bibcode=1968Sci...162.1243H|doi-access=free}}</ref> Although there is a communal incentive to protect the environment, maximizing the benefits in the long run, a company will conclude that it is in their best interest to utilize the ecotourism site beyond its sustainable level. By increasing the number of ecotourists, for instance, a company gains all the economic benefit while paying only a part of the environmental cost. In the same way, a company recognizes that there is no incentive to actively protect the environment; they bear all the costs, while the benefits are shared by all other companies. The result, again, is mismanagement.\n\nTaken together, the mobility of foreign investment and lack of economic incentive for environmental protection means that ecotourism companies are disposed to establishing themselves in new sites once their existing one is sufficiently degraded.\n\nIn addition, the systematic literature review conducted by Cabral and Dhar (2019) have identified several challenges due to slow progression of ecotourism initiatives such as (a) economic leakages, (b) lack of government involvement, (c) skill deficiency among the local communities,  (d) absence of disseminating environmental education, (e) sporadic increase in pollution, (f) conflict between tourism management personnel and local communities and (g) inadequate infrastructure development.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cabral|first=Clement|last2=Dhar|first2=Rajib Lochan|date=2019-06-10|title=Ecotourism research in India: from an integrative literature review to a future research framework|journal=Journal of Ecotourism|volume=0|pages=1\u201327|doi=10.1080/14724049.2019.1625359|issn=1472-4049}}</ref>\n\n===Case studies===\nThe purpose of ecotourism is to engage tourists in low impact, non-consumptive and locally oriented environments in order to maintain species and habitats \u2014 especially in underdeveloped regions.  While some ecotourism projects, including some found in the United States, can support such claims, many projects have failed to address some of the fundamental issues that nations face in the first place. Consequently, ecotourism may not generate the very benefits it is intended to provide to these regions and their people, and in some cases leaving economies in a state worse than before.<ref name=\"Fennell, David A.\">{{cite book |last= Fennell |first= David A.|title=Ecotourism: An Introduction. |origyear= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=1999|publisher=Routledge |location=London, England |language= |isbn=9780203457481 |oclc=51036894 |doi= |id= |pages=30 |chapter= |url= |quote= }}</ref>\n\t\nThe following case studies illustrate the rising complexity of ecotourism and its impacts, both positive and negative, on the environment and economies of various regions in the world.\n\n*[[Ecotourism in India]]\n*[[Ecotourism in Costa Rica]]\n* [[Ecotourism in Jordan]]\n* [[Ecotourism in South Africa]]\n* [[Ecotourism in the United States]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Environment|Ecology|Earth sciences}}\n{{div col}}\n*{{annotated link|Biodiversity}}\n*{{annotated link|Bioregion}}\n*{{annotated link|Conservation biology}}\n*{{annotated link|Conservation (ethic)}}\n*{{annotated link|Conservation movement}}\n*{{annotated link|Conservation-reliant species}}\n*{{annotated link|Earth science}}\n*{{annotated link|Eco hotel}}\n*{{annotated link|Ecology}}\n*{{annotated link|Ecomuseum}}\n*{{annotated link|Ecosystem}}\n*{{annotated link|Environmental movement}}\n*{{annotated link|Environmental protection}}\n*{{annotated link|Green hunting}}\n*{{annotated link|Habitat conservation}}\n*{{annotated link|Hypermobility (travel)}}\n*{{annotated link|Market governance mechanism}}\n*{{annotated link|Natural capital}}\n*{{annotated link|Natural environment}}\n*{{annotated link|Natural resource}}\n*{{annotated link|Renewable resource}}\n*{{annotated link|Shark tourism}}\n*{{annotated link|Sustainable development}}\n*{{annotated link|Sustainability}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/s0048-9697(99)00509-4|pmid=10813445|title=Landscapes, tourism, and conservation|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=249|issue=1\u20133|pages=39\u201349|year=2000|last1=Burger|first1=Joanna|bibcode=2000ScTEn.249...39B}}\n*Ceballos-Lascurain, H. 1996.

The battle ended in a French victory when ''Quebec'' was destroyed by an explosion.\n\n== Background ==\n\nFrance along with Spain joined on the side of the Americans and war was declared between France and Britain. Britain did not attempt a [[Blockade#Close, distant, and loose blockades|close blockade]] of French ports, rather a screen of frigates kept a vigil while the [[Ship of the line|ships of the line]] stayed at anchor at places like [[Torbay]] and [[Spithead]]. One of those frigates, operating off [[Guernsey]], was the thirty-two gun, twelve-pounder frigate HMS ''Quebec'' under [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[George Farmer (Royal Navy officer)|George Farmer]]. ''Quebec'' had run aground on a submerged rock and had to throw excess weight overboard to refloat her, sacrificing his 12-pound cannon. When repaired in [[Portsmouth]] there were no replacements at the time, so ship and crew went back out on station armed with only nine pounders.\n\nOn 6 October,  ''Quebec'' working with the [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] HMS ''Rambler'' of ten guns spotted a frigate and a cutter. By 8:00&nbsp;am they were found to be the French {{sclass-|Iphig\u00e9nie|frigate|0}}, 32-gun {{ship|French frigate|Surveillante|1778|2}}, under captain Cou\u00ebdic de Kergoaler and the cutter [[French corvette Exp\u00e9dition (1778)|''Exp\u00e9dition'']].<ref name=autogenerated1>Hennequin p. 101</ref>\n\n{{Gallery \n |title=Portraits of the commanders\n |align=center\n |File:George Farmer by Charles Grignion.jpg|Captain George Farmer by [[Charles Grignion the Younger]]\n |File:Charles du Cou\u00ebdic mg 8131.jpg|Charles du Cou\u00ebdic at [[Brest, France|Brest]] Mus\u00e9e national de Marine\n}}\n== Engagement ==\n''Quebec'' cleared for action and by 8:30 in the light wind the French frigate had opened fire. Within an hour ''Quebec'' opened fire after she became parallel with ''Surveillante''. Initially ''Quebec'' had the upper hand but ''Surveillante'' matched ''Quebec''{{'}}s every move, and from 10&nbsp;am until 1&nbsp;pm both sides battered each other furiously. Soon casualties and damages to the respective ships began to take their toll. Farmer was wounded as was the [[First lieutenant#Royal Navy|first lieutenant]] who had to have his arm amputated after part of it was shot away and remarkably soon went back to duty. Cou\u00ebdic was wounded twice within two hours but not seriously when all of ''Surveillante''{{'}}s [[Mast (sailing)|masts]] and rigging progressively crashed down. ''Quebec'' seeing an opportunity was about to finish the French ship but her severely damaged and weakened masts all came down within a space of a half an hour. ''Quebec''{{'}}s main and foremasts went over the disengaged side, but the mizzen mast came down on the engagement side blocking many of the gunports with the sails and rigging.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref name=autogenerated2>Carruthers p. 128</ref>\n\nThe ships drifted together with ''Surveillante''{{'}}s bowsprit becoming entangled in the wreckage of ''Quebec''{{'}}s mizzen mast. ''Quebec''{{'}}s gun captains kept up her rate of fire by shooting through the wreckage. Cou\u00ebdic saw his opportunity to board and take ''Quebec'' but they were repulsed with heavy losses including Cou\u00ebdic who had now an additional third wound.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nBy now a stalemate had ensued; both sides' priority was now taken to sorting the damage and casualties were heavy. However, a turn of events began: a fire had begun on ''Quebec''{{'}}s mangled and tangled sails covering the gun ports, as a result of cannon fire. The fire soon spread out of control and soon took a hold of ''Surveillante''. Cou\u00ebdic though managed to break free of ''Quebec'' by chopping off the wreckage that entangled both ships, and the fire on the French ship was brought under control.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> However, on ''Quebec'' the situation was serious; the fire had spread within the ship itself and had become totally uncontrollable.  Farmer ordered the [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]] to be flooded but this was now futile, and by 6&nbsp;pm the fire reached the magazine.

Within moments ''Quebec'' exploded taking whatever was left of her complement including Farmer himself.

Cou\u00ebdic and the rest of the French crew treated the surviving British as castaways found at sea, not as prisoners of war, seeing them repatriated without parole or exchange. Cou\u00ebdic died of his wounds in January 1780, and was admired for his courage and compassion by both the French and the British.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> ''Surveillante'' took nearly a year for repairs to be complete and went on to fight in American waters and even brought news of the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|peace in Paris]] in company with the British frigate ''Medea'' in the summer of 1783.\n\n===Art===\nNumerous paintings and drawings of the battle were made, notably by Auguste-Louis Rossel de Cercy (a key exhibit of the [[Mus\u00e9e national de la Marine]] in [[Paris]]), by [[George Carter (artist)|George Carter]] (of which a print is dedicated to [[George&nbsp;III]], the King of England) and by [[Robert Dodd (artist)|Robert Dodd]].\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"250px\">\nFile:Bataille surveillante quebec.jpg |Early part of the engagement.

The battle ended in a French victory when ''Quebec'' was destroyed by an explosion.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:George Farmer by Charles Grignion.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Captain George Farmer by [[Charles Grignion the Younger]]]]\n\nFrance along with Spain joined on the side of the Americans and war was declared between France and Britain. Britain did not attempt a [[Blockade#Close, distant, and loose blockades|close blockade]] of French ports, rather a screen of frigates kept a vigil while the [[Ship of the line|ships of the line]] stayed at anchor at places like [[Torbay]] and [[Spithead]]. One of those frigates, operating off [[Guernsey]], was the thirty-two gun, twelve-pounder frigate HMS ''Quebec'' under [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[George Farmer (Royal Navy officer)|George Farmer]]. ''Quebec'' had run aground on a submerged rock and had to throw excess weight overboard to refloat her, sacrificing his 12-pound cannon. When repaired in [[Portsmouth]] there were no replacements at the time, so ship and crew went back out on station armed with only nine pounders.\n\nOn 6 October,  ''Quebec'' working with the [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] HMS ''Rambler'' of ten guns spotted a frigate and a cutter. By 8:00&nbsp;am they were found to be the French {{sclass-|Iphig\u00e9nie|frigate|0}}, 32-gun {{ship|French frigate|Surveillante|1778|2}}, under captain Cou\u00ebdic de Kergoaler and the cutter [[French corvette Exp\u00e9dition (1778)|''Exp\u00e9dition'']].<ref name=autogenerated1>Hennequin p. 101</ref>\n[[File:Charles du Cou\u00ebdic mg 8131.jpg|thumb|left|Charles du Cou\u00ebdic at [[Brest, France|Brest]] Mus\u00e9e national de Marine]]\n\n== Engagement ==\n''Quebec'' cleared for action and by 8:30 in the light wind the French frigate had opened fire. Within an hour ''Quebec'' opened fire after she became parallel with ''Surveillante''. Initially ''Quebec'' had the upper hand but ''Surveillante'' matched ''Quebec''{{'}}s every move, and from 10&nbsp;am until 1&nbsp;pm both sides battered each other furiously. Soon casualties and damages to the respective ships began to take their toll. Farmer was wounded as was the [[First lieutenant#Royal Navy|first lieutenant]] who had to have his arm amputated after part of it was shot away and remarkably soon went back to duty. Cou\u00ebdic was wounded twice within two hours but not seriously when all of ''Surveillante''{{'}}s [[Mast (sailing)|masts]] and rigging progressively crashed down. ''Quebec'' seeing an opportunity was about to finish the French ship but her severely damaged and weakened masts all came down within a space of a half an hour. ''Quebec''{{'}}s main and foremasts went over the disengaged side, but the mizzen mast came down on the engagement side blocking many of the gunports with the sails and rigging.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref name=autogenerated2>Carruthers p. 128</ref>\n\nThe ships drifted together with ''Surveillante''{{'}}s bowsprit becoming entangled in the wreckage of ''Quebec''{{'}}s mizzen mast. ''Quebec''{{'}}s gun captains kept up her rate of fire by shooting through the wreckage. Cou\u00ebdic saw his opportunity to board and take ''Quebec'' but they were repulsed with heavy losses including Cou\u00ebdic who had now an additional third wound.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nBy now a stalemate had ensued; both sides' priority was now taken to sorting the damage and casualties were heavy. However, a turn of events began: a fire had begun on ''Quebec''{{'}}s mangled and tangled sails covering the gun ports, as a result of cannon fire. The fire soon spread out of control and soon took a hold of ''Surveillante''. Cou\u00ebdic though managed to break free of ''Quebec'' by chopping off the wreckage that entangled both ships, and the fire on the French ship was brought under control.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> However, on ''Quebec'' the situation was serious; the fire had spread within the ship itself and had become totally uncontrollable.  Farmer ordered the [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]] to be flooded but this was now futile, and by 6&nbsp;pm the fire reached the magazine. British sailors jumped into the water as some knew the inevitable would happen. Farmer ordered the ship to be abandoned and panic ensued. Within moments ''Quebec'' exploded taking whatever was left of her complement including Farmer himself. ''Surveillante'' managed to be out of harm's way but was so badly shot up the vessel did not have a boat that was seaworthy and could only throw ropes to those sailors (those that could swim) that managed to get close to her.\n\nThe cutters had fought their own separate battle and they too had battered themselves into submission. When ''Quebec'' exploded the task of rescuing survivors became a priority; the French cutter ''L'Expedition'' broke off the engagement and helped as best she could. The British cutter ''Rambler'' had her sails and rigging so badly damaged she was unable to pursue or even intervene; she sent out a boat instead to help.<ref name=autogenerated2 /><ref name=autogenerated3>Clark p. 131</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nOne of the difficulties in rescuing the crew was the heavy swell as well as the light wind. ''Rambler''{{'}}s boat saved a [[master's mate]], two [[midshipmen]] and fourteen sailors, while ''Surveillante'' saved the First Lieutenant, Second Lieutenant of [[Royal Marines|marines]], the surgeon and 36 of the crew. 13 more were saved by a passing Russian ship.<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\nThe damage to ''Surveillante'' was severe, her hull was leaking and had 30 killed and 85 wounded. British and French sailors then had to work together to keep her afloat, and in that they were successful. She returned to Brest the next day under a [[jury rig]].

The social environment was chaotic, and politics were passionate. German university faculties became universally open to Jewish scholars in 1918. Leading Jewish intellectuals on university faculties included physicist [[Albert Einstein]]; sociologists [[Karl Mannheim]], [[Erich Fromm]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer]], and [[Herbert Marcuse]]; philosophers [[Ernst Cassirer]] and [[Edmund Husserl]]; political theorists [[Arthur Rosenberg]] and [[Gustav Meyer]]; and many others.

The intellectuals associated with the [[Institute for Social Research]] (also known as the [[Frankfurt School]]) fled to the United States and reestablished the Institute at the [[New School for Social Research]] in New York City. In the words of Marcus Bullock, Emeritus Professor of English at [[University of Wisconsin&ndash;Milwaukee]], \"Remarkable for the way it emerged from a catastrophe, more remarkable for the way it vanished into a still greater catastrophe, the world of Weimar represents [[modernism]] in its most vivid manifestation.\" The culture of the Weimar period was later reprised by 1960s left-wing intellectuals,<ref name=\"KirkusLaqueur\">Kirkus Reviews, Dec 01, 1974. Review of Laqueur, Walter ''Weimar: A cultural history, 1918\u20131933''</ref> especially in France. [[Deleuze]], [[Guattari]] and [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] reprised [[Wilhelm Reich]]; [[Derrida]] reprised [[Husserl]] and [[Heidegger]]; [[Guy Debord]] and the [[Situationist International]] reprised the subversive-revolutionary culture.\n\n==Social environment==\nBy 1919, an influx of labor had migrated to [[Berlin]] turning it into a fertile ground for the modern arts and sciences, leading to boom in trade, communications and construction. A trend that had begun before the Great War was given powerful impetus by fall of the Kaiser and royal power. In response to the shortage of pre-war accommodation and housing, [[tenements]] were built not far from the Kaiser's Stadtschloss and other majestic structures erected in honor of former nobles. Average people began using their backyards and basements to run small shops, restaurants, and workshops. Commerce expanded rapidly, and included the establishment of Berlin's first department stores, prior WWI. An \"urban petty [[bourgeoisie]]\" along with a growing middle class grew and flourished in wholesale commerce, retail trade, factories and crafts.<ref>Schrader, Barbel. \"The 'Golden' Twenties: Art and Literature in the Weimar Republic\". Yale University Press, 1988, p.25-27.</ref>\n\nTypes of employment were becoming more modern, shifting gradually but noticeably towards industry and services. Before [[World War I]], in 1907, 54.9% of German workers were manual labourers. This dropped to 50.1% by 1925. Office workers, managers, and bureaucrats increased their share of the labour market from 10.3% to 17% over the same period. Germany was slowly becoming more urban and middle class. Still, by 1925, only a third of Germans lived in large cities; the other two-thirds of the population lived in the smaller towns or in rural areas.<ref>{{cite book|last=Peukert|first=Detlev|title=The Weimar Republic: the crisis of classical modernity|year=1993|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-8090-1556-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/weimarrepublic00detl/page/10 10]|url=https://archive.org/details/weimarrepublic00detl/page/10}}</ref> The total population of Germany rose from 62.4 million in 1920 to 65.2 million in 1933.<ref>{{cite book|last=Peukert|first=Detlev|title=The Weimar Republic: the crisis of classical modernity|year=1993|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-8090-1556-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/weimarrepublic00detl/page/7 7]|url=https://archive.org/details/weimarrepublic00detl/page/7}}</ref>\n\nThe [[German Empire|Wilheminian values]] were further discredited as consequence of [[World War I]] and the subsequent inflation, since the new youth generation saw no point in saving for marriage in such conditions, and preferred instead to spend and enjoy.<ref name=\"ThompsonB\">Bruce Thompson, University of California, Santa Cruz, [http://media.ucsc.edu/classes/thompson/weimar.html lecture on WEIMAR CULTURE/KAFKA'S PRAGUE]</ref> According to cultural historian Bruce Thompson, Fritz Lang movie ''[[Dr. Mabuse the Gambler]]'' (1922) captures Berlin's postwar mood:<ref name=\"ThompsonB\"/> {{quote| The film moves from the world of the slums to the world of the stock exchange and then to the cabarets and nightclubs\u2013and everywhere chaos reigns, authority is discredited, power is mad and uncontrollable, wealth inseparable from crime.}}\n\nPolitically and economically, the nation was struggling with the terms and reparations imposed by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (1919) that ended [[World War I]] and endured punishing levels of inflation.\n<gallery>\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R38586, Berlin, Essen f\u00fcr bed\u00fcrftige Kinder.jpg|Children being fed by a soup kitchen, 1924.\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B0527-0001-772, Berlin, Friseur-Salon, Angebot f\u00fcr Arbeitslose.jpg|A man reads a sign advertising \"Attention, Unemployed, Haircut 40 pfennigs, Shave 15 pfennigs\", 1927.\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-09249-0013, Berlin, alte Frau sammelt Abf\u00e4lle.jpg|An elderly woman gathers vegetable waste tossed from a vegetable seller's wagon for her lunch, 1923.\nFile:Lesser Ury Dame im Caf\u00e9.jpg|Sketch of a woman in a caf\u00e9 by [[Lesser Ury]] for a Berlin newspaper, 1925.\n</gallery>\n\n== Sociology ==\n\nDuring the era of the Weimar Republic, Germany became a center of intellectual thought at its universities, and most notably [[sociology|social]] and [[political theory]] (especially [[Marxism]]) was combined with [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] [[psychoanalysis]] to form the highly influential discipline of [[Critical Theory]]&mdash;with its development at the [[Institute for Social Research]] (also known as the [[Frankfurt School]]) founded at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]].\n\nThe most prominent philosophers with which the so-called '[[Frankfurt School]]' is associated were [[Erich Fromm]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]] and [[Max Horkheimer]].<ref>Outhwaite, William. 1988.

A striking example of this is the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]], which was designed in 1939, but resembles a modern jet transport more that it did other tactical aircraft of its time.\n\n[[Albert Einstein]] rose to public prominence during his years in Berlin, being awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] in 1921. He was forced to flee Germany and the Nazi regime in 1933.\n\nPhysician [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] established the [[Institut f\u00fcr Sexualwissenschaft]] (Institute for Sexology) in 1919, and it remained open until 1933. Hirschfeld believed that an understanding of homosexuality could be arrived at through science. Hirschfeld was a vocal advocate for homosexual, bisexual, and transgender legal rights for men and women, repeatedly petitioning parliament for legal changes. His Institute also included a museum. The Institute, museum and the Institute's library and archives were all destroyed by the Nazi regime in 1933.\n\nIf we also include the German-speaking Vienna, during the Weimar years Mathematician [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] published his groundbreaking ''[[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems|Incompleteness Theorem]]''.<ref>Selz, pp.27</ref>\n\n==Education==\n{{Further|Gymnasium (school)}}\nNew schools were frequently established in Weimar Germany to engage students in experimental methods of learning. Some were part of an emerging trend that combined research into physical movement and overall health, for example [[Eurythmy]] ensembles in [[Stuttgart]] that spread to other schools. Philosopher [[Rudolf Steiner]] established the first [[Waldorf education]] school in 1919, using a [[pedagogy]] also known as the Steiner method, which spread worldwide. Many Waldorf schools are in existence today.\n\n== The arts ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-P047336, Berlin, Mary Wigman-Studio.jpg|thumb|[[Mary Wigman]] (left)]]\nThe fourteen years of the Weimar era were also marked by explosive intellectual productivity. German artists made multiple cultural contributions in the fields of [[literature]], [[art]], [[architecture]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[drama]], and the new medium of the [[motion picture]]. Political theorist [[Ernst Bloch]] described Weimar culture as a ''[[Fifth-century Athens|Periclean Age]]''.\n\nGerman visual art, music, and literature were all strongly influenced by [[German Expressionism]] at the start of the Weimar Republic. By 1920, a sharp turn was taken towards the {{lang|de|Neue Sachlichkeit}} [[New Objectivity]] outlook. New Objectivity was not a strict movement in the sense of having a clear manifesto or set of rules. Artists gravitating towards this aesthetic defined themselves by rejecting the themes of expressionism\u2014romanticism, fantasy, subjectivity, raw emotion and impulse\u2014and focused instead on precision, deliberateness, and depicting the factual and the real.\n\n''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' remarked upon how much Weimar art was political:<ref name=\"KirkusLaqueurUK\">Kirkus UK review of Laqueur, Walter ''Weimar: A cultural history, 1918\u20131933''</ref> {{blockquote|fiercely experimental, iconoclastic and left-leaning, spiritually hostile to big business and bourgeois society and at daggers drawn with Prussian militarism and authoritarianism. Not surprisingly, the old autocratic German establishment saw it as 'decadent art', a view shared by Adolf Hitler who became Chancellor of Germany in January 1933. The public burning of 'unGerman books' by Nazi students on Unter den Linden on 10th May 1933 was but a symbolic confirmation of the catastrophe which befell not only Weimar art under Hitler but the whole tradition of enlightenment liberalism in Germany, a tradition whose origins went back to the 18th century city of Weimar, home to both Goethe and Schiller.}}\n\nOne of the first major events in the arts during the Weimar Republic was the founding of an organization, the {{lang|de|Novembergruppe}} ([[November Group (German)|November Group]]) on December 3, 1918. This group was established in the aftermath of the November beginning of the [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919]], when Communists, anarchists and pro-republic supporters had fought in the streets for control of the government. In 1919, the Weimar Republic was established. Around 100 artists of many genres who identified themselves as avant-garde joined the November Group. They held 19 exhibitions in Berlin until the group was banned by the Nazi regime in 1933. The group also had chapters throughout Germany during its existence, and brought the German avant-garde art scene to world attention by holding exhibits in Rome, Moscow and Japan.\n\nIts members also belonged to other art movements and groups during the Weimar Republic era, such as architect [[Walter Gropius]] (founder of [[Bauhaus]]), and [[Kurt Weill]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]] ([[agitprop]] theatre).<ref>{{cite book|last=Dempsey|first=Amy|title=Styles, Schools and Movements: The Essential Encyclopaedic Guide to Modern Art|year=2010|publisher=Thames & Hudson|isbn=978-0-500-28844-3|pages=128\u20139}}</ref> The artists of the November Group kept the spirit of radicalism alive in German art and culture during the Weimar Republic. Many of the painters, sculptors, music composers, architects, playwrights, and filmmakers who belonged to it, and still others associated with its members, were the same ones whose art would later be denounced as \"[[degenerate art]]\" by Adolf Hitler.\n\n===Visual arts===\n{{See also|German art#Weimar period}}\n[[File:Hoch-Cut With the Kitchen Knife.jpg|thumb|''Cut with the Dada Kitchen Knife through the Last Weimar Beer-Belly Cultural Epoch in Germany'' (1919) by [[Hannah H\u00f6ch]], a [[Dada]] pioneer of [[photomontage]] art.]]\nThe Weimar Republic era began in the midst of several major movements in the fine arts that continued into the 1920s. [[German Expressionism]] had begun before World War I and continued to have a strong influence throughout the 1920s, although artists were increasingly likely to position themselves in opposition to expressionist tendencies as the decade went on.\n\n[[Dada]] had begun in Zurich during World War I, and became an international phenomenon. Dada artists met and reformed groups of like-minded artists in Paris, Berlin, Cologne, and New York City. In Germany, [[Richard Huelsenbeck]] established the Berlin group, whose members included [[Jean Arp]], [[John Heartfield]], [[Wieland Hertzfelde]], [[Johannes Baader]], [[Raoul Hausmann]], [[George Grosz]] and [[Hannah H\u00f6ch]]. Machines, technology, and a strong [[Cubism]] element were features of their work. Jean Arp and [[Max Ernst]] formed a Cologne Dada group, and held a Dada Exhibition there that included a work by Ernst that had an axe \"placed there for the convenience of anyone who wanted to attack the work\".<ref name=\"Dempsey118\">{{cite book|last=Dempsey|first=Amy|title=Styles, Schools and Movements: The Essential Encyclopaedic Guide to Modern Art|year=2010|publisher=Thames & Hudson|isbn=978-0-500-28844-3|pages=118}}</ref> [[Kurt Schwitters]] established his own solitary one-man Dada \"group\" in Hanover, where he filled two stories of a house (the ''Merzbau'') with sculptures cobbled together with found objects and ephemera, each room dedicated to a notable artist friend of Schwitter's. The house was destroyed by Allied bombs in 1943.<ref name=\"Dempsey118\"/>\n\nThe [[New Objectivity]] artists did not belong to a formal group. Various Weimar Republic artists were oriented towards the concepts associated with it, however. Broadly speaking, artists linked with New Objectivity include [[K\u00e4the Kollwitz]], [[Otto Dix]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[George Grosz]], [[John Heartfield]], [[Conrad Felixm\u00fcller]], [[Christian Schad]], and [[Rudolf Schlichter]], who all \"worked in different styles, but shared many themes: the horrors of war, social hypocrisy and moral decadence, the plight of the poor and the rise of Nazism\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Dempsey|first=Amy|title=Styles, Schools and Movements: The Essential Encyclopaedic Guide to Modern Art|year=2010|publisher=Thames & Hudson|isbn=978-0-500-28844-3|pages=149}}</ref>\n\n[[Otto Dix]] and [[George Grosz]] referred to their own movement as [[Verism (Germany)|Verism]], a reference to the Roman classical [[Verism]] approach called ''verus'', meaning \"truth\", warts and all.

[[Bauhaus]]-style designs are distinctive, and synonymous with modern design. Designers from these movements turned their energy towards a variety of objects, from furniture, to typography, to buildings. [[Dada]]'s goal of critically rethinking design was similar to [[Bauhaus]], but whereas the earlier Dada movement was an aesthetic approach, the [[Bauhaus]] was literally a school, an institution that combined a former school of industrial design with a school of arts and crafts. The founders intended to fuse the arts and crafts with the practical demands of industrial design, to create works reflecting the [[New Objectivity]] aesthetic in Weimar Germany. [[Walter Gropius]], a founder of the Bauhaus school, stated \"we want an architecture adapted to our world of machines, radios and fast cars.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Curtis|first=William|title=\"Walter Gropius, German Expressionism, and the Bauhaus\".

The mass housing projects of [[Ernst May]] and [[Bruno Taut]] are evidence of markedly creative designs being incorporated as a major feature of new planned communities. [[Erich Mendelsohn]] and [[Hans Poelzig]] are other prominent Bauhaus architects, while [[Mies van der Rohe]] is noted for his architecture and his industrial and household furnishing designs.\n\nPainter [[Paul Klee]] was a faculty member of Bauhaus. His lectures on modern art (now known as the [[Paul Klee Notebooks]]) at the Bauhaus have been compared for importance to Leonardo's ''[[Treatise on Painting]]'' and Newton's ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', constituting the Principia Aesthetica of a new era of art;<ref>[[Guilo Carlo Argan]] \"Preface\", Paul Klee, The Thinking Eye, (ed.

Their aim was to assert pressure for political change on the Weimar Republic government, that would benefit the management of architecture and arts management, similar to Germany's large councils for workers and soldiers. This Berlin organization had around 50 members.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dempsey|first=Amy|title=Styles, Schools and Movements: The Essential Encyclopaedic Guide to Modern Art|year=2010|publisher=Thames & Hudson|isbn=978-0-500-28844-3|pages=126}}</ref>\n\nStill another influential affiliation of architects was the group [[Der Ring]] (The Ring) established by ten architects in Berlin in 1923-24, including: [[Otto Bartning]], [[Peter Behrens]], [[Hugo H\u00e4ring]], [[Erich Mendelsohn]], [[Mies van der Rohe]], [[Bruno Taut]] and [[Max Taut]].

Foreign writers also travelled to Berlin, lured by the city's dynamic, freer culture. The [[decadent]] [[cabaret]] scene of Berlin was documented by Britain's [[Christopher Isherwood]], such as in his novel ''[[Goodbye to Berlin]]'' which was later transposed to the play [[I Am a Camera]], which was adapted into the musical and musical movie ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]''.<ref name=\"ThompsonB\"/>\n\nEastern religions such as [[Buddhism]] were becoming more accessible in Berlin during the era, as Indian and East Asian musicians, dancers, and even visiting monks came to Europe. [[Hermann Hesse]] embraced Eastern philosophies and spiritual themes in his novels.\n\nCultural critic [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]], with his brilliantly controversial magazine ''Die Fackel'', advanced the field of satirical journalism, becoming the literary and political conscience of this era.<ref>Selz 45</ref>\n\nWeimar Germany also saw the publication of some of the world's first openly gay literature, from authors such as [[Klaus Mann]], [[Anna Elisabet Weirauch]], [[Christa Winsloe]], [[Erich Ebermayer]], and [[Max Ren\u00e9 Hesse]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chamberlin |first1=Rick |title=Coming out of His Father's Closet: Klaus Mann's \"Der fromme Tanz\" as an Anti-\"Tod in Venedig\" |journal=Monatshefte |date=2005 |volume=97 |issue=4 |pages=615\u2013627 |doi=10.3368/m.XCVII.4.615 |jstor=30154241 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Huneke |first1=Samuel Clowes |title=The Reception of Homosexuality in Klaus Mann's Weimar Era Works |journal=Monatshefte |date=2013 |volume=105 |issue=1 |pages=86\u2013100 |doi=10.1353/mon.2013.0027}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nenno |first1=Nancy P. |title=Bildung and Desire: Anna Elisabet Weirauch's Der Skorpion |journal=Queering the Canon: Defying Sights in German Literature and Culture |date=1998 |pages=207\u2013221}}</ref>\n\n===Theatre===\nThe theatres of [[Berlin]] and [[Frankfurt am Main]] were graced with drama by [[Ernst Toller]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[cabaret]], and stage direction by [[Max Reinhardt]] and [[Erwin Piscator]]. Many theatre works were sympathetic towards Marxist themes, or were overt experiments in propaganda, such as the [[agitprop theatre]] by Brecht and Weill. Agitprop theatre is named through a combination of the words \"agitation\" and \"propaganda\". Its aim was to add elements of public protest (agitation) and persuasive politics (propaganda) to the theatre, in the hope of creating a more activist audience. Among other works, Brecht and [[Kurt Weill]] collaborated on the musical or opera ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' (1928), also filmed, which remains a popular evocation of the period.\n\nToller was the leading German expressionist playwright of the era. He later became one of the leading proponents of [[New Objectivity]] in the theatre. The avant-garde theater of Bertolt Brecht and Max Reinhardt in Berlin was the most advanced in Europe, being rivaled only by that of Paris.<ref name=\"KirkusLaqueurUK\"/>\n\nThe Weimar years saw a flourishing of political and grotesque cabaret which, at least for the English-speaking world, has become iconic for the period through works such as ''[[The Berlin Stories]]'' by the English writer [[Christopher Isherwood]], who lived in Berlin from 1929-33.<ref name=\"Doyle 2013\"/> The musical and then the film ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'' were based upon Isherwood's misadventures at Nollendorfstrasse 17 in the Sch\u00f6neberg district where he lived with cabaret singer [[Jean Ross]].<ref name=\"Doyle 2013\">{{cite news | last = Doyle | first = Rachel | title = Looking for Christopher Isherwood's Berlin | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | page = TR10 | date = 12 April 2013 | df = dmy-all | access-date = 18 June 2018 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/travel/looking-for-christopher-isherwoods-berlin.html}}</ref> The main center for political cabaret was Berlin, with performers like comedian [[Otto Reutter]].<ref>[[Peter Gay]] (1968) ''Weimar Culture: The Outsider as Insider'' p.131</ref> [[Karl Valentin]] was a master of grotesque cabaret.\n\n===Music===\nConcert halls heard the [[Atonality|atonal]] and [[modernism (music)|modern music]] of [[Alban Berg]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], and [[Kurt Weill]]. [[Hanns Eisler]] and [[Paul Dessau]] were other modernist composers of the era. [[Richard Strauss]], in his 50s at the start of the period, continued to compose, mostly operas including ''[[Intermezzo (opera)|Intermezzo]]'' (1924) and ''[[Die \u00e4gyptische Helena]]'' (1928).\n\n===Modern dance===\n[[Rudolf von Laban]] and [[Mary Wigman]] laid the foundations for the development of [[contemporary dance]].\n\n===Cinema===\n[[File:Marlene Dietrich in The Blue Angel.png|thumb|''[[The Blue Angel]]'' (1930) was directed by [[Josef von Sternberg]].]]\n\nAt the beginning of the Weimar era, cinema meant silent films. [[German Expressionism|Expressionist films]] featured plots exploring the dark side of human nature. They had elaborate expressionist design sets, and the style was typically nightmarish in atmosphere. ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' (1919), directed by [[Robert Wiene]], is usually credited as the first German expressionist film. The sets depict distorted, warped-looking buildings in a German town, while the plot centres around a mysterious, magical cabinet that has a clear association with a casket. [[F. W. Murnau]]'s vampire horror film ''[[Nosferatu]]'' was released in 1922. [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Dr. Mabuse the Gambler]]'' (1922) was described as \"a sinister tale\" that portrays \"the corruption and social chaos so much in evidence in Berlin and more generally, according to Lang, in Weimar Germany\".<ref name=\"Hayward171\">{{cite book|last=Hayward|first=Susan|title=Cinema studies: the key concepts|year=2006|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-415-36781-3|pages=171}}</ref> [[Futurism]] is another favourite expressionist theme, shown corrupted into a force of oppression in the [[dystopia]] of ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927). The self-deluded lead characters in many expressionist films echo [[Goethe's Faust]], and Murnau indeed retold the tale in his film ''[[Faust (1926 film)|Faust]]''.\n\nGerman expressionism was not the dominant type of popular film in Weimar Germany and were outnumbered by the production of costume dramas, often about folk legends, which were enormously popular with the public.<ref name=\"Hayward171\"/> The Weimar era's most groundbreaking film studio was the [[Universum Film AG|UFA]] studio.\n\nSilent films continued to be made throughout the 1920s, in parallel with the early years of sound films during the final years of the Weimar Republic. Silent films had certain advantages for filmmakers, such as the ability to hire an international cast, since spoken accents were irrelevant. Thus, American and British actors were easily able to collaborate with German directors and cast-members on films made in Germany (for example, the collaborations of [[Georg Pabst]] and [[Louise Brooks]]). When sound films started being produced in Germany, some filmmakers experimented with versions in more than one language, filmed simultaneously. \n[[File:KoenerAndHirschfeld.png|thumb|left|A scene from ''[[Different from the Others]]'' (1919), a film made in Berlin, whose main character struggles with his homosexuality]]\n\nWhen the musical ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' was filmed by director Georg Pabst, he filmed the first version with a French-speaking cast (1930), then a second version with a German-speaking cast (1931). An English version was planned but never materialized.<ref>{{cite book|last=Robertson|first=James Crighton|title=The hidden cinema: British film censorship in action, 1913\u20131975|year=1993|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-09034-6|pages=53}}</ref> The Nazis destroyed the original negative print of the German version in 1933, and it was reconstructed after the War ended.<ref>{{cite book|last=Robertson|first=James Crighton|title=The hidden cinema: British film censorship in action, 1913\u20131975|year=1993|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-09034-6|pages=54}}</ref> ''[[The Blue Angel]]'' (1930), directed by [[Josef von Sternberg]] with the leads played by [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[Emil Jannings]], was filmed simultaneously in English and German (a different supporting cast was used for each version). Although it was based on a 1905 story written by [[Heinrich Mann]], the film is often seen as topical in that it depicts the doomed romance between a Berlin professor and a cabaret dancer. However, critics differ on this interpretation, with the absence of modern urban amenities such as automobiles being noted.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Gem\u00fcnden, Gerd |author2=Mary R.

''[[Diary of a Lost Girl]]'' (1929) directed by [[Georg Wilhelm Pabst]] and starring [[Louise Brooks]], deals with a young woman who is thrown out of her home after having an illegitimate child, and is then forced to become a prostitute to survive. This trend of dealing frankly with provocative material in cinema began immediately after the end of the War. In 1919, [[Richard Oswald]] directed and released two films, that met with press controversy and action from police vice investigators and government censors. ''Prostitution'' dealt with women forced into \"[[Sexual slavery|white slavery]]\", while ''[[Different from the Others]]'' dealt with a homosexual man's conflict between his sexuality and social expectations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Mel|title=The Seven Addictions and Five Professions of Anita Berber|year=2006|publisher=[[Feral House]]|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-1-932595-12-3|pages=55\u20136}}</ref> By the end of the decade, similar material met with little, if any opposition when it was released in Berlin theatres. [[William Dieterle]]'s ''[[Sex in Chains]]'' (1928), and Pabst's ''[[Pandora's Box (1929 film)|Pandora's Box]]'' (1929) deal with homosexuality among men and women, respectively, and were not censored. Homosexuality was also present more tangentially in other films from the period.\n\n==Philosophy==\n{{main|Berlin Circle}}\n{{further|Vienna Circle}}\nPhilosophy during the Weimar Republic pursued paths of enquiry into scientific fields such as mathematics and physics. Leading scientists became associated as a group that was called the [[Berlin Circle]]. Among many influential thinkers, [[Carl Hempel]] was a strong influence in the group. Born in Berlin, Hempel attended the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] and the [[University of Heidelberg]], then returned to Berlin, where he was taught by influential physicists [[Hans Reichenbach]] and [[Max Planck]], and logistics with mathematician [[John von Neumann]]. Reichenbach introduced Hempel to the Vienna Circle, who were an existing informal association of \"scientifically interested philosophers and philosophically interested scientists\", as Hempel put it.<ref name=\"MartinBailey206\">{{cite book|author1=Martin, Robert M. |author2=Andrew Bailey |lastauthoramp=yes |title=First Philosophy: Fundamental Problems and Readings in Philosophy, Volume 2|year=2011|publisher=Broadview Press|isbn=978-1-55111-973-1|pages=206}}</ref> Hempel was intrigued by the [[logical positivism]] ideas discussed by the Vienna Circle, and he developed a similar network, the Berlin Circle. Hempel's reputation has grown to the extent that he is now considered one of the leading scientific philosophers of the 20th century.<ref name=\"MartinBailey206\"/> [[Richard von Mises]] was active in both groups.\n\nGermany's most influential philosopher during the Weimar Republic years, and perhaps of the 20th century, was [[Martin Heidegger]]. Heidegger published one of the cornerstones of 20th-century philosophy during this period, ''[[Being and Time]]'' (1927). ''Being and Time'' influenced successive generations of philosophers in Europe and the United States, particularly in the areas of [[Phenomenology (architecture)|phenomenology]], [[existentialism]], [[hermeneutics]] and [[deconstruction]]. Heidegger's work built on, and responded to, the earlier explorations of phenomenology by another Weimar era philosopher, [[Edmund Husserl]].\n\nThe intersection of politics and philosophy inspired other philosophers in Weimar Germany, when radical politics included many thinkers and activists across the political spectrum. During his 20s, [[Herbert Marcuse]] was a student in Freiburg, where he went to study under [[Martin Heidegger]], one of Germany's most prominent philosophers. Marcuse himself later became a driving force in the [[New Left]] in the United States. [[Ernst Bloch]], [[Max Horkheimer]]  and [[Walter Benjamin]] all wrote about Marxism and politics in addition to other philosophical topics. From the perspective of Jewish philosophers in Germany, they also considered the problems posed by the \"[[Jewish question]]\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Geller|first=Jay|title=Walter Benjamin Reproducing the Scent of the Messianic|publisher=Fordham Scholarship Online|isbn=978-0-8232-3361-8|edition=Walter Benjamin Reproducing the Scent of the Messianic Jay Geller DOI:10.5422/fordham/9780823233618.003.0010|date=January 2012|doi=10.5422/fordham/9780823233618.001.0001}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Marcuse|first=Herbert|title=Philosophy, Psychoanalysis, and Emancipation|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2011 |isbn=978-0-415-13784-3|at=p. 3 footnote 4|editor=Kellner, Douglas |editor2=Clayton Pierce |editor3=Tyson Lewis}}</ref> Political philosophers [[Leo Strauss]] and [[Hannah Arendt]] received their university education during the Weimar Republic and moved in Jewish intellectual circles in Berlin, and were associated with [[Norbert Elias]], [[Leo L\u00f6wenthal]], [[Karl L\u00f6with]], [[Julius Guttmann]], [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Franz Rosenzweig]], [[Gershom Scholem]], and [[Alexander Altmann]]. Strauss and Arendt, along with Marcuse and Benjamin, were among the Jewish intellectuals who managed to flee the Nazi regime, eventually emigrating to the United States. [[Carl Schmitt]], a legal and political scholar, was also a vocal fascist supporter of both the Nazi regime and Spain's [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]; however, he published works of political philosophy that remained studied by philosophers and political scholars with radically different views, such as [[Alain Badiou]], [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek]], and his contemporaries [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Walter Benjamin]], and [[Leo Strauss]].\n\n==Health and self-improvement==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-11617, Hannover, Sch\u00fclerinnen der Logis-Schule.jpg|thumb|Students at a boarding school in Hanover, beginning each day with 8 o'clock rhythmic dancing and jumping exercises, 1931.]]\nGermany had many innovators in health treatment, some more questionable than others, in the decades leading up to World War I. As a group, they were collectively known as part of the [[Lebensreform]], or Life Reform, movement. During the Weimar years, some of these found traction with the German public, particularly in Berlin.\n\nSome innovations had lasting influence. [[Joseph Pilates]] developed much of his [[Pilates]] system of physical training during the 1920s. [[Expressionist dance]] teachers such as [[Rudolf Laban]] had an important impact on Pilates' theories.\n\n''Nacktkultur'', called [[naturism]] or modern nudism in English, was pioneered by [[Karl Wilhelm Diefenbach]] in Vienna in the late 1890s. Resorts for naturists were established at a rapid pace along the northern coast of Germany during the 1920s, and by 1931, Berlin itself had 40 naturists' societies and clubs.

This means of survival for desperate women, and sometimes men, became normalized to a degree in the 1920s. During the war, venereal diseases such as [[syphilis]] and [[gonorrhea]] spread at a rate that warranted government attention.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Mel|title=Voluptuous Panic: The Erotic World of Weimar Berlin|year=2006|publisher=Feral House|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-1-932595-11-6|pages=16}}</ref> Soldiers at the front contracted these diseases from prostitutes, so the German army responded by granting approval to certain brothels that were inspected by their own medical doctors, and soldiers were rationed coupon books for sexual services at these establishments.<ref name=\"Gordon17\">{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Mel|title=Voluptuous Panic: The Erotic World of Weimar Berlin|year=2006|publisher=Feral House|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-1-932595-11-6|pages=17}}</ref> Homosexual behaviour was also documented among soldiers at the front.

First women with no other means of support turned to the trade, then youths of both genders.\n\nCrime in general developed in parallel with prostitution in the city, beginning as petty thefts and other crimes linked to the need to survive in the war's aftermath. Berlin eventually acquired a reputation as a hub of drug dealing (cocaine, heroin, tranquilizers) and the black market. The police identified 62 organized criminal gangs in Berlin, called ''[[Ringvereine]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Mel|title=Voluptuous Panic: The Erotic World of Weimar Berlin|year=2006|publisher=Feral House|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-1-932595-11-6|pages=242}}</ref> The German public also became fascinated with reports of homicides, especially \"[[lust murder]]s\" or ''Lustmord''. Publishers met this demand with inexpensive criminal novels called ''Krimi'', which like the [[film noir]] of the era (such as the classic ''[[M (1931 film)|M]]''), explored methods of scientific detection and psychosexual analysis.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Mel|title=Voluptuous Panic: The Erotic World of Weimar Berlin|year=2006|publisher=Feral House|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-1-932595-11-6|pages=229}}</ref>\n\nApart from the new tolerance for behaviour that was technically still illegal, and viewed by a large part of society as immoral, there were other developments in Berlin culture that shocked many visitors to the city. Thrill-seekers came to the city in search of adventure, and booksellers sold many editions of guide books to Berlin's erotic night entertainment venues. There were an estimated 500 such establishments, that included a large number of homosexual venues for men and for women; sometimes transvestites of one or both genders were admitted, otherwise there were at least 5 known establishments that were exclusively for a transvestite clientele.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Mel|title=Voluptuous Panic: The Erotic World of Weimar Berlin|year=2006|publisher=Feral House|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-1-932595-11-6|pages=256}}</ref> There were also several nudist venues.

[[Anita Berber]], a dancer and actress, became notorious throughout the city and beyond for her erotic performances (as well as her cocaine addiction and erratic behaviour). She was painted by [[Otto Dix]], and socialized in the same circles as [[Klaus Mann]].\n\n==Gallery of 1920s Berlin cultural life==\n1920s Berlin was a city of many social contrasts.

The social environment was chaotic, and politics were passionate. German university faculties became universally open to Jewish scholars in 1918. Leading Jewish intellectuals on university faculties included physicist [[Albert Einstein]]; sociologists [[Karl Mannheim]], [[Erich Fromm]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer]], and [[Herbert Marcuse]]; philosophers [[Ernst Cassirer]] and [[Edmund Husserl]]; political theorists [[Arthur Rosenberg]] and [[Gustav Meyer]]; and many others.

The intellectuals associated with the [[Institute for Social Research]] (also known as the [[Frankfurt School]]) fled to the United States and reestablished the Institute at the [[New School for Social Research]] in New York City. In the words of Marcus Bullock, Emeritus Professor of English at [[University of Wisconsin&ndash;Milwaukee]], \"Remarkable for the way it emerged from a catastrophe, more remarkable for the way it vanished into a still greater catastrophe, the world of Weimar represents [[modernism]] in its most vivid manifestation.\" The culture of the Weimar period was later reprised by 1960s left-wing intellectuals,<ref name=\"KirkusLaqueur\">Kirkus Reviews, Dec 01, 1974.

A trend that had begun before the Great War was given powerful impetus by fall of the Kaiser and royal power. In response to the shortage of pre-war accommodation and housing, [[tenements]] were built not far from the Kaiser's Stadtschloss and other majestic structures erected in honor of former nobles. Average people began using their backyards and basements to run small shops, restaurants, and workshops. Commerce expanded rapidly, and included the establishment of Berlin's first department stores, prior WWI. An \"urban petty [[bourgeoisie]]\" along with a growing middle class grew and flourished in wholesale commerce, retail trade, factories and crafts.<ref>Schrader, Barbel. \"The 'Golden' Twenties: Art and Literature in the Weimar Republic\". Yale University Press, 1988, p.25-27.</ref>\n\nTypes of employment were becoming more modern, shifting gradually but noticeably towards industry and services. Before [[World War I]], in 1907, 54.9% of German workers were manual labourers. This dropped to 50.1% by 1925. Office workers, managers, and bureaucrats increased their share of the labour market from 10.3% to 17% over the same period. Germany was slowly becoming more urban and middle class. Still, by 1925, only a third of Germans lived in large cities; the other two-thirds of the population lived in the smaller towns or in rural areas.<ref>{{cite book|last=Peukert|first=Detlev|title=The Weimar Republic: the crisis of classical modernity|year=1993|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-8090-1556-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/weimarrepublic00detl/page/10 10]|url=https://archive.org/details/weimarrepublic00detl/page/10}}</ref> The total population of Germany rose from 62.4 million in 1920 to 65.2 million in 1933.<ref>{{cite book|last=Peukert|first=Detlev|title=The Weimar Republic: the crisis of classical modernity|year=1993|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-8090-1556-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/weimarrepublic00detl/page/7 7]|url=https://archive.org/details/weimarrepublic00detl/page/7}}</ref>\n\nThe [[German Empire|Wilheminian values]] were further discredited as consequence of [[World War I]] and the subsequent inflation, since the new youth generation saw no point in saving for marriage in such conditions, and preferred instead to spend and enjoy.<ref name=\"ThompsonB\">Bruce Thompson, University of California, Santa Cruz, [http://media.ucsc.edu/classes/thompson/weimar.html lecture on WEIMAR CULTURE/KAFKA'S PRAGUE]</ref> According to cultural historian Bruce Thompson, Fritz Lang movie ''[[Dr. Mabuse the Gambler]]'' (1922) captures Berlin's postwar mood:<ref name=\"ThompsonB\"/> {{quote| The film moves from the world of the slums to the world of the stock exchange and then to the cabarets and nightclubs\u2013and everywhere chaos reigns, authority is discredited, power is mad and uncontrollable, wealth inseparable from crime.}}\n\nPolitically and economically, the nation was struggling with the terms and reparations imposed by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (1919) that ended [[World War I]] and endured punishing levels of inflation.\n<gallery>\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R38586, Berlin, Essen f\u00fcr bed\u00fcrftige Kinder.jpg|Children being fed by a soup kitchen, 1924.\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B0527-0001-772, Berlin, Friseur-Salon, Angebot f\u00fcr Arbeitslose.jpg|A man reads a sign advertising \"Attention, Unemployed, Haircut 40 pfennigs, Shave 15 pfennigs\", 1927.\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-09249-0013, Berlin, alte Frau sammelt Abf\u00e4lle.jpg|An elderly woman gathers vegetable waste tossed from a vegetable seller's wagon for her lunch, 1923.\nFile:Lesser Ury Dame im Caf\u00e9.jpg|Sketch of a woman in a caf\u00e9 by [[Lesser Ury]] for a Berlin newspaper, 1925.\n</gallery>\n\n== Sociology ==\n\nDuring the era of the Weimar Republic, Germany became a center of intellectual thought at its universities, and most notably [[sociology|social]] and [[political theory]] (especially [[Marxism]]) was combined with [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] [[psychoanalysis]] to form the highly influential discipline of [[Critical Theory]]&mdash;with its development at the [[Institute for Social Research]] (also known as the [[Frankfurt School]]) founded at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt am Main]].\n\nThe most prominent philosophers with which the so-called '[[Frankfurt School]]' is associated were [[Erich Fromm]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]] and [[Max Horkheimer]].<ref>Outhwaite, William. 1988.

While temporarily at the University of Copenhagen, German physicist [[Werner Heisenberg]] formulated his [[Uncertainty principle]], and, with [[Max Born]] and [[Pascual Jordan]], accomplished the first complete and correct definition of quantum mechanics, through the invention of [[Matrix mechanics]].<ref>''[http://www.vub.ac.be/CLEA/IQSA/history.html History of Quantum Structures and IQSA - The Birth of Quantum Mechanics]''</ref>\n\n[[G\u00f6ttingen]] was the center of research in [[aerodynamics|aero-]] and [[fluid dynamics|fluid-dynamics]] in the early 20th century. Mathematical aerodynamics was founded by [[Ludwig Prandtl]] before [[World War I]], and the work continued at G\u00f6ttingen until interfered with in the 1930s and prohibited in the late 1940s. It was there that [[Compressible flow|compressibility drag]] and its reduction in aircraft was first understood. A striking example of this is the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]], which was designed in 1939, but resembles a modern jet transport more that it did other tactical aircraft of its time.\n\n[[Albert Einstein]] rose to public prominence during his years in Berlin, being awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] in 1921. He was forced to flee Germany and the Nazi regime in 1933.\n\nPhysician [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] established the [[Institut f\u00fcr Sexualwissenschaft]] (Institute for Sexology) in 1919, and it remained open until 1933. Hirschfeld believed that an understanding of homosexuality could be arrived at through science. Hirschfeld was a vocal advocate for homosexual, bisexual, and transgender legal rights for men and women, repeatedly petitioning parliament for legal changes. His Institute also included a museum. The Institute, museum and the Institute's library and archives were all destroyed by the Nazi regime in 1933.\n\nIf we also include the German-speaking Vienna, during the Weimar years Mathematician [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] published his groundbreaking ''[[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems|Incompleteness Theorem]]''.<ref>Selz, pp.27</ref>\n\n==Education==\n{{Further|Gymnasium (school)}}\nNew schools were frequently established in Weimar Germany to engage students in experimental methods of learning. Some were part of an emerging trend that combined research into physical movement and overall health, for example [[Eurythmy]] ensembles in [[Stuttgart]] that spread to other schools. Philosopher [[Rudolf Steiner]] established the first [[Waldorf education]] school in 1919, using a [[pedagogy]] also known as the Steiner method, which spread worldwide. Many Waldorf schools are in existence today.\n\n== The arts ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-P047336, Berlin, Mary Wigman-Studio.jpg|thumb|[[Mary Wigman]] (left)]]\nThe fourteen years of the Weimar era were also marked by explosive intellectual productivity. German artists made multiple cultural contributions in the fields of [[literature]], [[art]], [[architecture]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[drama]], and the new medium of the [[motion picture]]. Political theorist [[Ernst Bloch]] described Weimar culture as a ''[[Fifth-century Athens|Periclean Age]]''.\n\nGerman visual art, music, and literature were all strongly influenced by [[German Expressionism]] at the start of the Weimar Republic. By 1920, a sharp turn was taken towards the {{lang|de|Neue Sachlichkeit}} [[New Objectivity]] outlook. New Objectivity was not a strict movement in the sense of having a clear manifesto or set of rules. Artists gravitating towards this aesthetic defined themselves by rejecting the themes of expressionism\u2014romanticism, fantasy, subjectivity, raw emotion and impulse\u2014and focused instead on precision, deliberateness, and depicting the factual and the real.\n\n''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' remarked upon how much Weimar art was political:<ref name=\"KirkusLaqueurUK\">Kirkus UK review of Laqueur, Walter ''Weimar: A cultural history, 1918\u20131933''</ref> {{blockquote|fiercely experimental, iconoclastic and left-leaning, spiritually hostile to big business and bourgeois society and at daggers drawn with Prussian militarism and authoritarianism. Not surprisingly, the old autocratic German establishment saw it as 'decadent art', a view shared by Adolf Hitler who became Chancellor of Germany in January 1933. The public burning of 'unGerman books' by Nazi students on Unter den Linden on 10th May 1933 was but a symbolic confirmation of the catastrophe which befell not only Weimar art under Hitler but the whole tradition of enlightenment liberalism in Germany, a tradition whose origins went back to the 18th century city of Weimar, home to both Goethe and Schiller.}}\n\nOne of the first major events in the arts during the Weimar Republic was the founding of an organization, the {{lang|de|Novembergruppe}} ([[November Group (German)|November Group]]) on December 3, 1918. This group was established in the aftermath of the November beginning of the [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919]], when Communists, anarchists and pro-republic supporters had fought in the streets for control of the government. In 1919, the Weimar Republic was established. Around 100 artists of many genres who identified themselves as avant-garde joined the November Group. They held 19 exhibitions in Berlin until the group was banned by the Nazi regime in 1933. The group also had chapters throughout Germany during its existence, and brought the German avant-garde art scene to world attention by holding exhibits in Rome, Moscow and Japan.\n\nIts members also belonged to other art movements and groups during the Weimar Republic era, such as architect [[Walter Gropius]] (founder of [[Bauhaus]]), and [[Kurt Weill]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]] ([[agitprop]] theatre).<ref>{{cite book|last=Dempsey|first=Amy|title=Styles, Schools and Movements: The Essential Encyclopaedic Guide to Modern Art|year=2010|publisher=Thames & Hudson|isbn=978-0-500-28844-3|pages=128\u20139}}</ref> The artists of the November Group kept the spirit of radicalism alive in German art and culture during the Weimar Republic. Many of the painters, sculptors, music composers, architects, playwrights, and filmmakers who belonged to it, and still others associated with its members, were the same ones whose art would later be denounced as \"[[degenerate art]]\" by Adolf Hitler.\n\n===Visual arts===\n{{See also|German art#Weimar period}}\n[[File:Hoch-Cut With the Kitchen Knife.jpg|thumb|''Cut with the Dada Kitchen Knife through the Last Weimar Beer-Belly Cultural Epoch in Germany'' (1919) by [[Hannah H\u00f6ch]], a [[Dada]] pioneer of [[photomontage]] art.]]\nThe Weimar Republic era began in the midst of several major movements in the fine arts that continued into the 1920s. [[German Expressionism]] had begun before World War I and continued to have a strong influence throughout the 1920s, although artists were increasingly likely to position themselves in opposition to expressionist tendencies as the decade went on.\n\n[[Dada]] had begun in Zurich during World War I, and became an international phenomenon. Dada artists met and reformed groups of like-minded artists in Paris, Berlin, Cologne, and New York City. In Germany, [[Richard Huelsenbeck]] established the Berlin group, whose members included [[Jean Arp]], [[John Heartfield]], [[Wieland Hertzfelde]], [[Johannes Baader]], [[Raoul Hausmann]], [[George Grosz]] and [[Hannah H\u00f6ch]]. Machines, technology, and a strong [[Cubism]] element were features of their work. Jean Arp and [[Max Ernst]] formed a Cologne Dada group, and held a Dada Exhibition there that included a work by Ernst that had an axe \"placed there for the convenience of anyone who wanted to attack the work\".<ref name=\"Dempsey118\">{{cite book|last=Dempsey|first=Amy|title=Styles, Schools and Movements: The Essential Encyclopaedic Guide to Modern Art|year=2010|publisher=Thames & Hudson|isbn=978-0-500-28844-3|pages=118}}</ref> [[Kurt Schwitters]] established his own solitary one-man Dada \"group\" in Hanover, where he filled two stories of a house (the ''Merzbau'') with sculptures cobbled together with found objects and ephemera, each room dedicated to a notable artist friend of Schwitter's.

Various Weimar Republic artists were oriented towards the concepts associated with it, however. Broadly speaking, artists linked with New Objectivity include [[K\u00e4the Kollwitz]], [[Otto Dix]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[George Grosz]], [[John Heartfield]], [[Conrad Felixm\u00fcller]], [[Christian Schad]], and [[Rudolf Schlichter]], who all \"worked in different styles, but shared many themes: the horrors of war, social hypocrisy and moral decadence, the plight of the poor and the rise of Nazism\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Dempsey|first=Amy|title=Styles, Schools and Movements: The Essential Encyclopaedic Guide to Modern Art|year=2010|publisher=Thames & Hudson|isbn=978-0-500-28844-3|pages=149}}</ref>\n\n[[Otto Dix]] and [[George Grosz]] referred to their own movement as [[Verism (Germany)|Verism]], a reference to the Roman classical [[Verism]] approach called ''verus'', meaning \"truth\", warts and all.

[[Bauhaus]]-style designs are distinctive, and synonymous with modern design. Designers from these movements turned their energy towards a variety of objects, from furniture, to typography, to buildings. [[Dada]]'s goal of critically rethinking design was similar to [[Bauhaus]], but whereas the earlier Dada movement was an aesthetic approach, the [[Bauhaus]] was literally a school, an institution that combined a former school of industrial design with a school of arts and crafts. The founders intended to fuse the arts and crafts with the practical demands of industrial design, to create works reflecting the [[New Objectivity]] aesthetic in Weimar Germany. [[Walter Gropius]], a founder of the Bauhaus school, stated \"we want an architecture adapted to our world of machines, radios and fast cars.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Curtis|first=William|title=\"Walter Gropius, German Expressionism, and the Bauhaus\".

The mass housing projects of [[Ernst May]] and [[Bruno Taut]] are evidence of markedly creative designs being incorporated as a major feature of new planned communities. [[Erich Mendelsohn]] and [[Hans Poelzig]] are other prominent Bauhaus architects, while [[Mies van der Rohe]] is noted for his architecture and his industrial and household furnishing designs.\n\nPainter [[Paul Klee]] was a faculty member of Bauhaus. His lectures on modern art (now known as the [[Paul Klee Notebooks]]) at the Bauhaus have been compared for importance to Leonardo's ''[[Treatise on Painting]]'' and Newton's ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', constituting the Principia Aesthetica of a new era of art;<ref>[[Guilo Carlo Argan]] \"Preface\", Paul Klee, The Thinking Eye, (ed.

Their aim was to assert pressure for political change on the Weimar Republic government, that would benefit the management of architecture and arts management, similar to Germany's large councils for workers and soldiers. This Berlin organization had around 50 members.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dempsey|first=Amy|title=Styles, Schools and Movements: The Essential Encyclopaedic Guide to Modern Art|year=2010|publisher=Thames & Hudson|isbn=978-0-500-28844-3|pages=126}}</ref>\n\nStill another influential affiliation of architects was the group [[Der Ring]] (The Ring) established by ten architects in Berlin in 1923-24, including: [[Otto Bartning]], [[Peter Behrens]], [[Hugo H\u00e4ring]], [[Erich Mendelsohn]], [[Mies van der Rohe]], [[Bruno Taut]] and [[Max Taut]].

Foreign writers also travelled to Berlin, lured by the city's dynamic, freer culture. The [[decadent]] [[cabaret]] scene of Berlin was documented by Britain's [[Christopher Isherwood]], such as in his novel ''[[Goodbye to Berlin]]'' which was later transposed to the play [[I Am a Camera]], which was adapted into the musical and musical movie ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]''.<ref name=\"ThompsonB\"/>\n\nEastern religions such as [[Buddhism]] were becoming more accessible in Berlin during the era, as Indian and East Asian musicians, dancers, and even visiting monks came to Europe. [[Hermann Hesse]] embraced Eastern philosophies and spiritual themes in his novels.\n\nCultural critic [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]], with his brilliantly controversial magazine ''Die Fackel'', advanced the field of satirical journalism, becoming the literary and political conscience of this era.<ref>Selz 45</ref>\n\nWeimar Germany also saw the publication of some of the world's first openly gay literature, from authors such as [[Klaus Mann]], [[Anna Elisabet Weirauch]], [[Christa Winsloe]], [[Erich Ebermayer]], and [[Max Ren\u00e9 Hesse]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chamberlin |first1=Rick |title=Coming out of His Father's Closet: Klaus Mann's \"Der fromme Tanz\" as an Anti-\"Tod in Venedig\" |journal=Monatshefte |date=2005 |volume=97 |issue=4 |pages=615\u2013627 |doi=10.3368/m.XCVII.4.615 |jstor=30154241 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Huneke |first1=Samuel Clowes |title=The Reception of Homosexuality in Klaus Mann's Weimar Era Works |journal=Monatshefte |date=2013 |volume=105 |issue=1 |pages=86\u2013100 |doi=10.1353/mon.2013.0027}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nenno |first1=Nancy P. |title=Bildung and Desire: Anna Elisabet Weirauch's Der Skorpion |journal=Queering the Canon: Defying Sights in German Literature and Culture |date=1998 |pages=207\u2013221}}</ref>\n\n===Theatre===\nThe theatres of [[Berlin]] and [[Frankfurt am Main]] were graced with drama by [[Ernst Toller]], [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[cabaret]], and stage direction by [[Max Reinhardt]] and [[Erwin Piscator]]. Many theatre works were sympathetic towards Marxist themes, or were overt experiments in propaganda, such as the [[agitprop theatre]] by Brecht and Weill. Agitprop theatre is named through a combination of the words \"agitation\" and \"propaganda\". Its aim was to add elements of public protest (agitation) and persuasive politics (propaganda) to the theatre, in the hope of creating a more activist audience. Among other works, Brecht and [[Kurt Weill]] collaborated on the musical or opera ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' (1928), also filmed, which remains a popular evocation of the period.\n\nToller was the leading German expressionist playwright of the era. He later became one of the leading proponents of [[New Objectivity]] in the theatre. The avant-garde theater of Bertolt Brecht and Max Reinhardt in Berlin was the most advanced in Europe, being rivaled only by that of Paris.<ref name=\"KirkusLaqueurUK\"/>\n\nThe Weimar years saw a flourishing of political and grotesque cabaret which, at least for the English-speaking world, has become iconic for the period through works such as ''[[The Berlin Stories]]'' by the English writer [[Christopher Isherwood]], who lived in Berlin from 1929-33.<ref name=\"Doyle 2013\"/> The musical and then the film ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'' were based upon Isherwood's misadventures at Nollendorfstrasse 17 in the Sch\u00f6neberg district where he lived with cabaret singer [[Jean Ross]].<ref name=\"Doyle 2013\">{{cite news | last = Doyle | first = Rachel | title = Looking for Christopher Isherwood's Berlin | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | page = TR10 | date = 12 April 2013 | df = dmy-all | access-date = 18 June 2018 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/travel/looking-for-christopher-isherwoods-berlin.html}}</ref> The main center for political cabaret was Berlin, with performers like comedian [[Otto Reutter]].<ref>[[Peter Gay]] (1968) ''Weimar Culture: The Outsider as Insider'' p.131</ref> [[Karl Valentin]] was a master of grotesque cabaret.\n\n===Music===\nConcert halls heard the [[Atonality|atonal]] and [[modernism (music)|modern music]] of [[Alban Berg]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], and [[Kurt Weill]]. [[Hanns Eisler]] and [[Paul Dessau]] were other modernist composers of the era. [[Richard Strauss]], in his 50s at the start of the period, continued to compose, mostly operas including ''[[Intermezzo (opera)|Intermezzo]]'' (1924) and ''[[Die \u00e4gyptische Helena]]'' (1928).\n\n===Modern dance===\n[[Rudolf von Laban]] and [[Mary Wigman]] laid the foundations for the development of [[contemporary dance]].\n\n===Cinema===\n[[File:Marlene Dietrich in The Blue Angel.png|thumb|''[[The Blue Angel]]'' (1930) was directed by [[Josef von Sternberg]].]]\n\nAt the beginning of the Weimar era, cinema meant silent films. [[German Expressionism|Expressionist films]] featured plots exploring the dark side of human nature. They had elaborate expressionist design sets, and the style was typically nightmarish in atmosphere. ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' (1919), directed by [[Robert Wiene]], is usually credited as the first German expressionist film. The sets depict distorted, warped-looking buildings in a German town, while the plot centres around a mysterious, magical cabinet that has a clear association with a casket. [[F. W. Murnau]]'s vampire horror film ''[[Nosferatu]]'' was released in 1922. [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Dr. Mabuse the Gambler]]'' (1922) was described as \"a sinister tale\" that portrays \"the corruption and social chaos so much in evidence in Berlin and more generally, according to Lang, in Weimar Germany\".<ref name=\"Hayward171\">{{cite book|last=Hayward|first=Susan|title=Cinema studies: the key concepts|year=2006|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-415-36781-3|pages=171}}</ref> [[Futurism]] is another favourite expressionist theme, shown corrupted into a force of oppression in the [[dystopia]] of ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927). The self-deluded lead characters in many expressionist films echo [[Goethe's Faust]], and Murnau indeed retold the tale in his film ''[[Faust (1926 film)|Faust]]''.\n\nGerman expressionism was not the dominant type of popular film in Weimar Germany and were outnumbered by the production of costume dramas, often about folk legends, which were enormously popular with the public.<ref name=\"Hayward171\"/> The Weimar era's most groundbreaking film studio was the [[Universum Film AG|UFA]] studio.\n\nSilent films continued to be made throughout the 1920s, in parallel with the early years of sound films during the final years of the Weimar Republic. Silent films had certain advantages for filmmakers, such as the ability to hire an international cast, since spoken accents were irrelevant. Thus, American and British actors were easily able to collaborate with German directors and cast-members on films made in Germany (for example, the collaborations of [[Georg Pabst]] and [[Louise Brooks]]). When sound films started being produced in Germany, some filmmakers experimented with versions in more than one language, filmed simultaneously. \n[[File:KoenerAndHirschfeld.png|thumb|left|A scene from ''[[Different from the Others]]'' (1919), a film made in Berlin, whose main character struggles with his homosexuality]]\n\nWhen the musical ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' was filmed by director Georg Pabst, he filmed the first version with a French-speaking cast (1930), then a second version with a German-speaking cast (1931). An English version was planned but never materialized.<ref>{{cite book|last=Robertson|first=James Crighton|title=The hidden cinema: British film censorship in action, 1913\u20131975|year=1993|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-09034-6|pages=53}}</ref> The Nazis destroyed the original negative print of the German version in 1933, and it was reconstructed after the War ended.<ref>{{cite book|last=Robertson|first=James Crighton|title=The hidden cinema: British film censorship in action, 1913\u20131975|year=1993|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-09034-6|pages=54}}</ref> ''[[The Blue Angel]]'' (1930), directed by [[Josef von Sternberg]] with the leads played by [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[Emil Jannings]], was filmed simultaneously in English and German (a different supporting cast was used for each version). Although it was based on a 1905 story written by [[Heinrich Mann]], the film is often seen as topical in that it depicts the doomed romance between a Berlin professor and a cabaret dancer. However, critics differ on this interpretation, with the absence of modern urban amenities such as automobiles being noted.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Gem\u00fcnden, Gerd |author2=Mary R.

''[[Diary of a Lost Girl]]'' (1929) directed by [[Georg Wilhelm Pabst]] and starring [[Louise Brooks]], deals with a young woman who is thrown out of her home after having an illegitimate child, and is then forced to become a prostitute to survive. This trend of dealing frankly with provocative material in cinema began immediately after the end of the War. In 1919, [[Richard Oswald]] directed and released two films, that met with press controversy and action from police vice investigators and government censors. ''Prostitution'' dealt with women forced into \"[[Sexual slavery|white slavery]]\", while ''[[Different from the Others]]'' dealt with a homosexual man's conflict between his sexuality and social expectations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Mel|title=The Seven Addictions and Five Professions of Anita Berber|year=2006|publisher=[[Feral House]]|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-1-932595-12-3|pages=55\u20136}}</ref> By the end of the decade, similar material met with little, if any opposition when it was released in Berlin theatres. [[William Dieterle]]'s ''[[Sex in Chains]]'' (1928), and Pabst's ''[[Pandora's Box (1929 film)|Pandora's Box]]'' (1929) deal with homosexuality among men and women, respectively, and were not censored. Homosexuality was also present more tangentially in other films from the period.\n\n==Philosophy==\n{{main|Berlin Circle}}\n{{further|Vienna Circle}}\nPhilosophy during the Weimar Republic pursued paths of enquiry into scientific fields such as mathematics and physics. Leading scientists became associated as a group that was called the [[Berlin Circle]]. Among many influential thinkers, [[Carl Hempel]] was a strong influence in the group. Born in Berlin, Hempel attended the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] and the [[University of Heidelberg]], then returned to Berlin, where he was taught by influential physicists [[Hans Reichenbach]] and [[Max Planck]], and logistics with mathematician [[John von Neumann]]. Reichenbach introduced Hempel to the Vienna Circle, who were an existing informal association of \"scientifically interested philosophers and philosophically interested scientists\", as Hempel put it.<ref name=\"MartinBailey206\">{{cite book|author1=Martin, Robert M. |author2=Andrew Bailey |lastauthoramp=yes |title=First Philosophy: Fundamental Problems and Readings in Philosophy, Volume 2|year=2011|publisher=Broadview Press|isbn=978-1-55111-973-1|pages=206}}</ref> Hempel was intrigued by the [[logical positivism]] ideas discussed by the Vienna Circle, and he developed a similar network, the Berlin Circle. Hempel's reputation has grown to the extent that he is now considered one of the leading scientific philosophers of the 20th century.<ref name=\"MartinBailey206\"/> [[Richard von Mises]] was active in both groups.\n\nGermany's most influential philosopher during the Weimar Republic years, and perhaps of the 20th century, was [[Martin Heidegger]]. Heidegger published one of the cornerstones of 20th-century philosophy during this period, ''[[Being and Time]]'' (1927). ''Being and Time'' influenced successive generations of philosophers in Europe and the United States, particularly in the areas of [[Phenomenology (architecture)|phenomenology]], [[existentialism]], [[hermeneutics]] and [[deconstruction]]. Heidegger's work built on, and responded to, the earlier explorations of phenomenology by another Weimar era philosopher, [[Edmund Husserl]].\n\nThe intersection of politics and philosophy inspired other philosophers in Weimar Germany, when radical politics included many thinkers and activists across the political spectrum. During his 20s, [[Herbert Marcuse]] was a student in Freiburg, where he went to study under [[Martin Heidegger]], one of Germany's most prominent philosophers. Marcuse himself later became a driving force in the [[New Left]] in the United States. [[Ernst Bloch]], [[Max Horkheimer]]  and [[Walter Benjamin]] all wrote about Marxism and politics in addition to other philosophical topics. From the perspective of Jewish philosophers in Germany, they also considered the problems posed by the \"[[Jewish question]]\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Geller|first=Jay|title=Walter Benjamin Reproducing the Scent of the Messianic|publisher=Fordham Scholarship Online|isbn=978-0-8232-3361-8|edition=Walter Benjamin Reproducing the Scent of the Messianic Jay Geller DOI:10.5422/fordham/9780823233618.003.0010|date=January 2012|doi=10.5422/fordham/9780823233618.001.0001}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Marcuse|first=Herbert|title=Philosophy, Psychoanalysis, and Emancipation|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2011 |isbn=978-0-415-13784-3|at=p. 3 footnote 4|editor=Kellner, Douglas |editor2=Clayton Pierce |editor3=Tyson Lewis}}</ref> Political philosophers [[Leo Strauss]] and [[Hannah Arendt]] received their university education during the Weimar Republic and moved in Jewish intellectual circles in Berlin, and were associated with [[Norbert Elias]], [[Leo L\u00f6wenthal]], [[Karl L\u00f6with]], [[Julius Guttmann]], [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Franz Rosenzweig]], [[Gershom Scholem]], and [[Alexander Altmann]]. Strauss and Arendt, along with Marcuse and Benjamin, were among the Jewish intellectuals who managed to flee the Nazi regime, eventually emigrating to the United States. [[Carl Schmitt]], a legal and political scholar, was also a vocal fascist supporter of both the Nazi regime and Spain's [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]; however, he published works of political philosophy that remained studied by philosophers and political scholars with radically different views, such as [[Alain Badiou]], [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek]], and his contemporaries [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Walter Benjamin]], and [[Leo Strauss]].\n\n==Health and self-improvement==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-11617, Hannover, Sch\u00fclerinnen der Logis-Schule.jpg|thumb|Students at a boarding school in Hanover, beginning each day with 8 o'clock rhythmic dancing and jumping exercises, 1931.]]\nGermany had many innovators in health treatment, some more questionable than others, in the decades leading up to World War I. As a group, they were collectively known as part of the [[Lebensreform]], or Life Reform, movement. During the Weimar years, some of these found traction with the German public, particularly in Berlin.\n\nSome innovations had lasting influence. [[Joseph Pilates]] developed much of his [[Pilates]] system of physical training during the 1920s. [[Expressionist dance]] teachers such as [[Rudolf Laban]] had an important impact on Pilates' theories.\n\n''Nacktkultur'', called [[naturism]] or modern nudism in English, was pioneered by [[Karl Wilhelm Diefenbach]] in Vienna in the late 1890s. Resorts for naturists were established at a rapid pace along the northern coast of Germany during the 1920s, and by 1931, Berlin itself had 40 naturists' societies and clubs. A variety of periodicals on the topic were also regularly published.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Mel|title=Voluptuous Panic: The Erotic World of Weimar Berlin|year=2006|publisher=Feral House|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-1-932595-11-6|pages=132}}</ref>\n\nPhilosopher [[Rudolf Steiner]], like Diefenbach, was a follower of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]. Steiner had an enormous influence on the [[alternative health]] movement before his death in 1925 and far beyond. With [[Ita Wegman]], he developed [[anthroposophical medicine]].

First women with no other means of support turned to the trade, then youths of both genders.\n\nCrime in general developed in parallel with prostitution in the city, beginning as petty thefts and other crimes linked to the need to survive in the war's aftermath. Berlin eventually acquired a reputation as a hub of drug dealing (cocaine, heroin, tranquilizers) and the black market. The police identified 62 organized criminal gangs in Berlin, called ''[[Ringvereine]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Mel|title=Voluptuous Panic: The Erotic World of Weimar Berlin|year=2006|publisher=Feral House|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-1-932595-11-6|pages=242}}</ref> The German public also became fascinated with reports of homicides, especially \"[[lust murder]]s\" or ''Lustmord''.

Thrill-seekers came to the city in search of adventure, and booksellers sold many editions of guide books to Berlin's erotic night entertainment venues. There were an estimated 500 such establishments, that included a large number of homosexual venues for men and for women; sometimes transvestites of one or both genders were admitted, otherwise there were at least 5 known establishments that were exclusively for a transvestite clientele.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Mel|title=Voluptuous Panic: The Erotic World of Weimar Berlin|year=2006|publisher=Feral House|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-1-932595-11-6|pages=256}}</ref> There were also several nudist venues.

His father, Sidney Lazard, is a former foreign [[correspondent]], and his mother, Julie (n\u00e9e Thayer), is a photographer. In 1974, the family relocated to Paris where his father was stationed by ABC News. After his parents' divorce when he was a freshman in high school, Lazard marked time in boarding schools and at [[Emory University]]. Transferring to NYU to study acting, he was \"discovered\" in a bar by a talent agent and was soon appearing in TV commercials.\n\n===Acting career===\nAfter a small role in ''[[Spike of Bensonhurst]]'' in 1988, Lazard landed the recurring role of a punk-rock undercover cop on NBC's ''[[Miami Vice]]'', appearing in three episodes. To pay for acting classes, he began a brief career as a model. Small parts in features (i.e., ''[[Born to Ride (film)|Born to Ride]]'' in 1991) and regular roles in unsuccessful series (e.g., ''Second Chances''; CBS 1993\u201394) followed.\n\nIn 1995, Lazard landed the role of a charming stockbroker on the primetime CBS soap ''[[Central Park West (TV series)|Central Park West]]'', but the series floundered and despite some retooling and a title change to \"CPW\", the show was cancelled after its second season. He starred in ''[[Extreme (1995 TV series)|Extreme]]'' (1995) as part of a Rocky Mountain rescue team but the series was cut short after 7 episodes. He had a role in the [[direct-to-video]] release ''[[The Big Fall]]'' (1997).\n\nWorking in partnership with his brother Marc through Lazard Productions, he began to create material for himself. His most notable role was in ''[[Species II]]'' (1998) as an astronaut who mutates into an alien bent on having sex with human women and impregnating them, creating a race of alien children. He went on to produce the thriller ''[[Dark Harbor]]'' (1998), which he co-scripted with director [[Adam Coleman Howard]]. Lazard also served as executive producer on ''Stanley's Gig'' in 2000, written and directed by his brother, Marc.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200171 ''Stanley's Gig'' (2000) details], imdb.com; accessed January 14, 2016.</ref>\n\n===Personal life===\nLazard married model Shannon Fluet in 2008.

Earlier days it was known by the name Thoduvetty (another name for the Marthandam market region), it was a portion of Kanyakumari district which was added to the state of [[Tamil Nadu]] on 1 November 1956.\n\nMarthandam is the largest town in the district. It derived its name from the ruler of Travancore, Sri Padmanabhadasa Vanchipala Anizham Tirunal Bala Marthanda Varma. Martandam is famous for honey, cashew nut processing, rubber and hand-embroidered motifs. The area is full of greenery, and there is a river adjoining. It is also a major trade centre due to its location bordering Kerala. It is one of the most fertile lands of Tamil Nadu and has the climatic conditions of Kerala. [1]\n\n==History==\nSouthern Division, or Padmanabhapuram Division till 1921 and Trivandrum Division from 1921 to 1949, was one of the administrative divisions of the princely state of Travancore. It covered the five taluks of Agastiswaram, Eraniel, Kalkulam, Thovalay and Vilavancode and was administered by a civil servant of rank Diwan Peishkar equivalent to a District Collector in British India. The Southern division was predominantly Tamil-speaking in contrast to the other three divisions where Malayalam was spoken. In 1920, the neighbouring Trivandrum was also merged with the Southern division. In 1949, the princely state of Travancore was dissolved and the Southern Division was included in the Travancore-Cochin state of India.\nIn 1956, the Tamil-speaking taluks of Southern Division were transferred to the neighbouring Madras State as per the States Reorganisation Act of 1956 and forms the present-day Kanyakumari district of Tamil Nadu.

The aqueduct is built across the Pahrali river, a small river that originates in the Mahendragiri Hills of the Western Ghats. Mathur Aqueduct itself carries water of the Pattanamkal canal for irrigation over the Pahrali river, from one hill to another, for a distance of close to one kilometer. This Aqueduct is necessitated due to the undulating land terrain of the area, which is also adjacent to the hills of the Western Ghats.\n\nMathur Aqueduct is a concrete structure held up by 28 huge pillars; the maximum height of the pillars reaching {{convert|115|ft}}. The trough structure is 7&nbsp;ft in height, with a width of {{cvt|7.5|ft}}. The trough is partly covered on top with concrete slabs, allowing people to walk on the bridge and also see the water going through the trough. Some of the pillars are set in rocks of the Pahrali river, though some of the pillars are set in hills on either side.\n\nRoad access allows one to drive in to one side of the Aqueduct (up to one end), while it is also possible to drive into the foot of the Aqueduct (the level where the Pahrali flows) on the opposite side. There is also a huge flight of stairs (made in recent times) that allows one to climb from the level of the Pahrali river to the trough.\n\n==Folk arts==\nThere are several Folk Arts practiced in temples for [[Sastha]], [[Sudalaimadan]] and [[Yakshiamman]]. Villupattu is especially for Sastha temples and Kaniankoothu is practiced for Sudalaimadan. Grand Tamil poet [[Avvaiyar]] temples are found along with Yakshi amman temples and worship of teachings of Avvaiyar can be observed\n\nMany Folk arts and dances are popular in this district. They are played during the time of festivals in temples, celebrations in schools etc. ''Bow Song'' ([[Villu Paatu]]) is an ancient form of musical- storytelling art of southern Tamil Nadu. Villu Paatu has been especially popular in [[Thovalai]] and neighbouring areas of the district.\n\nBow, the age-old weapon of warriors - paradoxically lends itself to be used as a primary musical instrument for the Villu Pattu artists.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://tamilnadu.com/arts/villu-paatu.html |title=Arts - Villu Paatu |publisher= Tamilnadu.com |date= 26 February 2013}}</ref> There are Udukku, Kudam, Thala, Kattai, etc. as supplementary instruments in their performances. [[Udukku]], mentioned in the ancient [[Tamil literature]] as [[Thudi]], is a small drum with a slender middle portion which is held in the left hand and played by the fingers of the right hand. Occasionally, the Villu Pattu team divides itself into two groups, each trying to prove opposite points-of-view of a subject. This is called [[Lavani Pattu]]. The songs used by the Villu Pattu artists are mostly traditional folk-songs.\n\n[[Thiruvathira Kali]] occupies the pride of place among the folk dances. It resembles Kummi and is played especially during [[Onam]] festival. The players are young girls. The necessary number of girls is 8,10,12 or 16 for each dance. They move round and sing in chorus. Each girl strikes the stick (Kole) which she holds in each hand, and the striking of the sticks and the steps, which she makes are rhythmical to the tune.\n\n[[Kalial]] is a folk dance played by group of men or boys in the country side. A group leader sings songs and keeps time with [[cymbal]]s. The players stand in a circle with sticks in their hand and dance round a lighted lamp repeating the songs sung by the leader. They turn, twist, lean forward and backward, squat and move round singing to the tune. At the beginning the steps are elaborate and at times, they are also very quick. When invited to perform in a function, the players generally begin the dance with an invocation for heavenly aid and conclude the dance with a torch - dance using lighted torches. This folk dance exhibits the artistic and recreative life of the country side.\n\n[[Kathakali]] is a unique form of [[drama]], which has its origin in [[Travancore]]. Kathakali (story-dance) is a relatively recent (fifteenth or sixteenth century) development of earlier dances, which, like dances every where, arose out of religious expression through symbolical action. In this art-form, the characters express their ideas not by words, but by significant gestures. In Kanyakumari District, it is now played in the temples at Thiruvattar, Thirparappu, Ponmana, Kuzhithura, Neyyoor, Nattalam and Munchira during the time of festivals.\n\n[[Ottam Thullal]] is a form of story telling. It is a popular for of amusement, staged in the temple premises and Malayalam is the language commonly used. Ottam Thullal is now played in the temples of Thiruvattar, Thirparappu, Ponmana, Nattalam and Thirunanthikara in the district during the time of festivals.\n\nKalari, is an ancient martial art of Kerala. A tradition believed to have been founded by Parasurama is known as Vadakkan Kalari ; another is credited to Agasthiar in which the emphasis is on striking at vital points of the body and not on weapons, even through sword, knife, Urumi (rolling sword), Mankombu (horns of a deer), Kandakkodali, (a kind of axe), mazhu (a kind of axe) etc., are also used.

Earlier days it was known by the name Thoduvetty (another name for the Marthandam market region), it was a portion of Kanyakumari district which was added to the state of [[Tamil Nadu]] on 1 November 1956.\n\nIt is the second largest town next to [[Nagercoil]] in the district. Marthandam derived its name from the ruler of Travancore, Sri Padmanabhadasa Vanchipala Anizham Tirunal Bala Marthanda Varma. Martandam is famous for honey, cashew nut processing, rubber and hand-embroidered motifs. The area is full of greenery, and there is a river adjoining. It is also a major trade centre due to its location bordering Kerala. It is one of the most fertile lands of Tamil Nadu and has the climatic conditions of Kerala. [1]\n\n==History==\nSouthern Division, or Padmanabhapuram Division till 1921 and Trivandrum Division from 1921 to 1949, was one of the administrative divisions of the princely state of Travancore. It covered the five taluks of Agastiswaram, Eraniel, Kalkulam, Thovalay and Vilavancode and was administered by a civil servant of rank Diwan Peishkar equivalent to a District Collector in British India. The Southern division was predominantly Tamil-speaking in contrast to the other three divisions where Malayalam was spoken. In 1920, the neighbouring Trivandrum was also merged with the Southern division. In 1949, the princely state of Travancore was dissolved and the Southern Division was included in the Travancore-Cochin state of India.\nIn 1956, the Tamil-speaking taluks of Southern Division were transferred to the neighbouring Madras State as per the States Reorganisation Act of 1956 and forms the present-day Kanyakumari district of Tamil Nadu. The Malayalam-speaking taluks of the erstwhile Trivandrum division form the Thiruvananthapuram district of Kerala. The headquarters of the Southern Division were at Padmanabhapuram.\n\n==Education==\n\n===Schools===\n\n*[[Good Shepherd Matriculation Higher Secondary School (Marthandam)]].<ref>[wikimapia.org/10424793/Good-Shepherd-Matric-HSS]</ref>\n{{Cleanup-list|date=February 2019}}\n\n*Abraham James Memorial Matriculation School.\n*Abraham Memorial Higher Secondary School, Maruthancode.\n*Aided Higher Secondary School, Arumana.\n*Child Jesus matriculation school, Unnamalakada.\n*Christ International School, Malamary.\n*Christuraja matriculation higher secondary school.\n*Government Boys Higher Secondary School, Marthandam.\n*Government Girls Higher Secondary School, Marthandam.\n*Hindu vidhyalaya matriculation school.\n*Infant Jesus Matriculation Higher Secondary School.\n*K.A.B.D.M.Hr Sec School, Koottalumoodu, Painkulam\n*L.M.S Boys higher secondary school\n*L.M.S Girls higher secondary school.\n*M.J.K.M.

And it has a total area: {{cvt|1,665|km2}}, population: 20,669,924, Malankara Catholics: 65,000; languages: Tamil, English, Malayalam.\n\n====Other churches====\n\nThe Salvation Army Church Kiliyancode,\nTPM church in Marthandam is located on Bethel Street, while [[IPC Marthandam Central Church]] is also located nearby.\n\n===Religious festivals===\n\nOnam and Christmas celebrations are massive in Marthandam. In this district, Christmas is celebrated more than the rest of Tamil Nadu.\nVishu is also celebrated well in this district due to its neighbour Kerala and presence of Malayalam-speaking people throughout the border of district.\nAlso festivals such as Deepavali,New Year, Ramzan, and Easter are celebrated in this district.\n\n==Attractions==\n\n===Tourist spots nearby===\n'''[[Padmanabhapuram Palace]]'''\n[[File:Padmanabhapuram Palace 5.jpg|thumb|Padmanabhapuram Palace]]\n\n'''[[Udayagiri Fort]]].'''\n[[File:Udayakiri fort.jpg|thumb|Udayakiri fort]]\n\n'''[[Thirparappu]] waterfalls.'''\n[[File:Thriparappu falls.JPG|thumb|Thriparappu falls]]\n\n'''[[Pechiparai Reservoir]].'''\n[[File:Pechiparai dam.JPG|thumb|Pechiparai dam]]\n\n'''[[Thengapattanam]] Beach.'''\n[[File:Tpmbeach 2013-12-30 17-41.jpg|thumbnail|Thengapattanam beach]]\n\n===[[Mathur Aqueduct]]===\n[[File:Mathur Aqueduct.JPG|thumb|right|Mathur Aqueduct - one of the largest Aqueducts in Asia]]\nIt is one of the longest and highest aqueducts in South Asia and is also a popular tourist spot in Kanyakumari District. The aqueduct is built across the Pahrali river, a small river that originates in the Mahendragiri Hills of the Western Ghats. Mathur Aqueduct itself carries water of the Pattanamkal canal for irrigation over the Pahrali river, from one hill to another, for a distance of close to one kilometer. This Aqueduct is necessitated due to the undulating land terrain of the area, which is also adjacent to the hills of the Western Ghats.\n\nMathur Aqueduct is a concrete structure held up by 28 huge pillars; the maximum height of the pillars reaching {{convert|115|ft}}. The trough structure is 7&nbsp;ft in height, with a width of {{cvt|7.5|ft}}. The trough is partly covered on top with concrete slabs, allowing people to walk on the bridge and also see the water going through the trough. Some of the pillars are set in rocks of the Pahrali river, though some of the pillars are set in hills on either side.\n\nRoad access allows one to drive in to one side of the Aqueduct (up to one end), while it is also possible to drive into the foot of the Aqueduct (the level where the Pahrali flows) on the opposite side. There is also a huge flight of stairs (made in recent times) that allows one to climb from the level of the Pahrali river to the trough.\n\n==Folk arts==\nThere are several Folk Arts practiced in temples for [[Sastha]], [[Sudalaimadan]] and [[Yakshiamman]]. Villupattu is especially for Sastha temples and Kaniankoothu is practiced for Sudalaimadan. Grand Tamil poet [[Avvaiyar]] temples are found along with Yakshi amman temples and worship of teachings of Avvaiyar can be observed\n\nMany Folk arts and dances are popular in this district. They are played during the time of festivals in temples, celebrations in schools etc. ''Bow Song'' ([[Villu Paatu]]) is an ancient form of musical- storytelling art of southern Tamil Nadu. Villu Paatu has been especially popular in [[Thovalai]] and neighbouring areas of the district.\n\nBow, the age-old weapon of warriors - paradoxically lends itself to be used as a primary musical instrument for the Villu Pattu artists.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://tamilnadu.com/arts/villu-paatu.html |title=Arts - Villu Paatu |publisher= Tamilnadu.com |date= 26 February 2013}}</ref> There are Udukku, Kudam, Thala, Kattai, etc. as supplementary instruments in their performances. [[Udukku]], mentioned in the ancient [[Tamil literature]] as [[Thudi]], is a small drum with a slender middle portion which is held in the left hand and played by the fingers of the right hand. Occasionally, the Villu Pattu team divides itself into two groups, each trying to prove opposite points-of-view of a subject. This is called [[Lavani Pattu]]. The songs used by the Villu Pattu artists are mostly traditional folk-songs.\n\n[[Thiruvathira Kali]] occupies the pride of place among the folk dances. It resembles Kummi and is played especially during [[Onam]] festival. The players are young girls. The necessary number of girls is 8,10,12 or 16 for each dance. They move round and sing in chorus. Each girl strikes the stick (Kole) which she holds in each hand, and the striking of the sticks and the steps, which she makes are rhythmical to the tune.\n\n[[Kalial]] is a folk dance played by group of men or boys in the country side. A group leader sings songs and keeps time with [[cymbal]]s. The players stand in a circle with sticks in their hand and dance round a lighted lamp repeating the songs sung by the leader. They turn, twist, lean forward and backward, squat and move round singing to the tune. At the beginning the steps are elaborate and at times, they are also very quick. When invited to perform in a function, the players generally begin the dance with an invocation for heavenly aid and conclude the dance with a torch - dance using lighted torches. This folk dance exhibits the artistic and recreative life of the country side.\n\n[[Kathakali]] is a unique form of [[drama]], which has its origin in [[Travancore]]. Kathakali (story-dance) is a relatively recent (fifteenth or sixteenth century) development of earlier dances, which, like dances every where, arose out of religious expression through symbolical action. In this art-form, the characters express their ideas not by words, but by significant gestures. In Kanyakumari District, it is now played in the temples at Thiruvattar, Thirparappu, Ponmana, Kuzhithura, Neyyoor, Nattalam and Munchira during the time of festivals.\n\n[[Ottam Thullal]] is a form of story telling. It is a popular for of amusement, staged in the temple premises and Malayalam is the language commonly used. Ottam Thullal is now played in the temples of Thiruvattar, Thirparappu, Ponmana, Nattalam and Thirunanthikara in the district during the time of festivals.\n\nKalari, is an ancient martial art of Kerala. A tradition believed to have been founded by Parasurama is known as Vadakkan Kalari ; another is credited to Agasthiar in which the emphasis is on striking at vital points of the body and not on weapons, even through sword, knife, Urumi (rolling sword), Mankombu (horns of a deer), Kandakkodali, (a kind of axe), mazhu (a kind of axe) etc., are also used. Kanyakumari district is home to an indigenous form of martial arts called '[[Adimurai]]' or 'naadan', which is often confused with the Kalari of Kerala, in spite of its uniqueness.\n\n==Notable places near Marthandam==\nThe following towns are within {{cvt|3|-|18|km}} from Marthandam:\n{{Div col|colwidth=15em}}\n<!-- ONLY ADD A PLACE TO THIS LIST IF IT ALREADY HASE AN ARTICLE IN THE ENGLISH WIKIPEDIA -->\n*[[Arumana]], 10&nbsp;km\n*[[Kappukad]], 4&nbsp;km\n*[[Karavilai]], 3&nbsp;km\n*[[Karungal]], 8&nbsp;km\n*[[Kollenvilagam]], 3&nbsp;km\n*[[Kottagom]], 4&nbsp;km\n*[[Kulasekaram]], 11&nbsp;km\n*[[Kuzhithura]], 3&nbsp;km\n*[[Manjalumoodu]], 14&nbsp;km\n*[[Thoothoor]], 14&nbsp;km\n*[[Marthandanthura]], 17&nbsp;km\n*[[Melpuram]], 7&nbsp;km\n*[[Munchira]], 8&nbsp;km\n*[[Neerody]], 18&nbsp;km\n*[[Pacode]], 4&nbsp;km\n*[[Palliyadi]], 7&nbsp;km\n*[[Payanam]], 3&nbsp;km\n*[[Pulippunam]], 5&nbsp;km\n*[[Thengapattanam]], 13&nbsp;km\n*[[Thirunattalam]], 4&nbsp;km\n*[[Vallavila]], 18&nbsp;km\n*[[Munchirai]]\n*[[Painkulam]]\n<!-- ONLY ADD A PLACE TO THIS LIST IF IT ALREADY HASE AN ARTICLE IN THE ENGLISH WIKIPEDIA -->\n{{Div col end}}\n<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/Bursting-at-its-seams/article15141565.ece |title=Bursting at its seams | first=P.

A modern version is the ''exovent.''

This causes the pressure in the chest cavity to decrease, and the [[lung]]s expand to fill the space. This, in turn, causes the pressure of the air inside the lungs to decrease (it becomes negative, relative to the atmosphere), and air flows from the atmosphere, through the patient's [[airway]], into their lungs: [[inhalation]]. When the diaphragm relaxes, the reverse happens and the person [[exhalation|exhales]]. If a person loses part or all of the ability to control the muscles involved, breathing becomes difficult or impossible.\n\n===breathing with iron lung===\nThe iron lung encloses the patient entirely, except for their head (which includes their main airway orfices: nose and mouth). A pump (typically a mechanically-powered diaphragm) reduces the momentarily reduces the air pressure inside the iron lung, to a pressure lower than outside (ambient) air.  \n\nThis causes the air within the iron lung, but outside the chest wall, to be at a lower pressure than the air inside the patient's lungs (thus, the term \"negative pressure\"), so the patient's lungs and chest expand to equalize their pressure to the lower pressure of the interior of the iron lung. \n\nNow, the expanded lungs are at a lower pressure than the \"ambient\" air outside the iron lung.  As a result, outside (ambient) air forces its way in through the patient's exposed nose and mouth, into their airway, to fill the lower-pressure space inside the patient's lungs -- and the patient has thus \"taken a breath\" (\"inhaled\").  \n\nExhaling is stimulated by allowing the pressure inside the iron lung to return to normal, matching the outside (ambient) air pressure.  As a result, the patient's chest is no longer being expanded by negative pressure, and the natural elasticity of the chest causes it to collapse, squeezing air out of the lungs, through the patient's airway, to their mouth and nose -- and the patient has thus \"exhaled.\"\n\nThe process continues cycling, repetitively, at a rate set by the person operating the iron lung's controls, to maintain continuous patient artificial respiration (artificial \"breathing\").\n\n==Invention and early use==\n\n===Initial development===\n[[File:Museum-gt-eiserne-lunge.jpg|thumb|Iron lung from the 1950s in the [[Stadtmuseum G\u00fctersloh|G\u00fctersloh Town Museum]].

Despite this success, Henderson was reprimanded for secretly using hospital facilities to build the machine.<ref name=\"Wills\">{{cite book| last=Wills| first=Elspeth| title=Scottish Firsts: A Celebration of Innovation and Achievement| publisher=[[Mainstream Publishing]]| location=Edinburgh| year=2002| pages=[https://archive.org/details/scottishfirstsce00will/page/51 51\u20132]| isbn=978-1840186116| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/scottishfirstsce00will/page/51}}</ref><ref name=\"Thomas\">{{cite web| last=Thomas| first=Campbell| date=15 February 2000| url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/dr-robert-henderson-1.249085| title=Dr Robert Henderson | work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]| accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Both respirator===\n[[File:Both Cabinet Respirator in WWII.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Both cabinet respirator being used to treat a patient at the 110th Australian Military Hospital in 1943]]\n{{main|Both respirator}}\nThe [[Both respirator]], a negative pressure ventilator, was invented in 1937 when Australia's epidemic of poliomyelitis created an immediate need for more ventilating machines to compensate for respiratory paralysis. Although the Drinker model was effective and saved lives, its widespread use was hindered by the fact that the machines were very large, heavy (about 750 lbs), bulky, and expensive. In the US, an adult machine cost about $2000 in 1930, and \u00a32000 delivered to Melbourne in 1936. The cost in Europe in the mid-1950s was around \u00a31500.

This causes the pressure in the chest cavity to decrease, and the [[lung]]s expand to fill the space. This, in turn, causes the pressure of the air inside the lungs to decrease (it becomes negative, relative to the atmosphere), and air flows from the atmosphere, through the patient's [[airway]], into their lungs: [[inhalation]]. When the diaphragm relaxes, the reverse happens and the person [[exhalation|exhales]]. If a person loses part or all of the ability to control the muscles involved, breathing becomes difficult or impossible.\n\n===breathing with iron lung===\nThe iron lung encloses the patient entirely, except for their head (which includes their main airway orfices: nose and mouth). A pump (typically a mechanically-powered diaphragm) reduces the momentarily reduces the air pressure inside the iron lung, to a pressure lower than outside (ambient) air.  \n\nThis causes the air within the iron lung, but outside the chest wall, to be at a lower pressure than the air inside the patient's lungs (thus, the term \"negative pressure\"), so the patient's lungs and chest expand to equalize their pressure to the lower pressure of the interior of the iron lung. \n\nNow, the expanded lungs are at a lower pressure than the \"ambient\" air outside the iron lung.  As a result, outside (ambient) air forces its way in through the patient's exposed nose and mouth, into their airway, to fill the lower-pressure space inside the patient's lungs -- and the patient has thus \"taken a breath\" (\"inhaled\").  \n\nExhaling is stimulated by allowing the pressure inside the iron lung to return to normal, matching the outside (ambient) air pressure.  As a result, the patient's chest is no longer being expanded by negative pressure, and the natural elasticity of the chest causes it to collapse, squeezing air out of the lungs, through the patient's airway, to their mouth and nose -- and the patient has thus \"exhaled.\"\n\nThe process continues cycling, repetitively, at a rate set by the person operating the iron lung's controls, to maintain continuous patient artificial respiration (artificial \"breathing\").\n\n==Invention and early use==\n\n===Initial development===\n[[File:Museum-gt-eiserne-lunge.jpg|thumb|Iron lung from the 1950s in the [[Stadtmuseum G\u00fctersloh|G\u00fctersloh Town Museum]].
