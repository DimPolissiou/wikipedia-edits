With a [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] of D+34, the 7th is by far the most Democratic district in New England.

The turbulent history of the area, particularly due to expansion of the [[Ottoman Empire]], resulted in a patchwork of dialectal and religious differences. Due to population migrations, [[Shtokavian]] became the most widespread language in the western Balkans, intruding westwards into the area previously occupied by [[Chakavian]] and [[Kajkavian]] (which further blend into [[Slovene language|Slovenian]] in the northwest). [[Bosniaks]], [[Croats]] and [[Serbs]] differ in religion and were historically often part of different cultural circles, although a large part of the nations have lived side by side under foreign overlords. During that period, the language was referred to under a variety of names, such as \"Slavic\" in general or \"Serbian\", \"Croatian\" or \"Bosnian\" in particular. In a classicizing manner, it was also referred to as \"Illyrian\".\n\nThe process of [[linguistic standardization]] of Serbo-Croatian was originally initiated in the mid-19th-century [[Vienna Literary Agreement]] by Croatian and Serbian writers and philologists, decades before a Yugoslav state was established.{{Sfn | Blum | 2002 | pp = 130\u2013132}} From the very beginning, there were slightly different literary Serbian and Croatian standards, although both were based on the same dialect of Shtokavian, [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect|Eastern Herzegovinian]]. In the 20th century, Serbo-Croatian served as the official language of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] (when it was called \"Serbo-Croato-Slovenian\"),<ref name=\"Busch2004\" /> and later as one of the official languages of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. The [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] affected language attitudes, so that [[Language secessionism#In Serbo-Croatian|social conceptions of the language separated]] on ethnic and political lines. Since the breakup of Yugoslavia, Bosnian has likewise been established as an official standard in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and there is an ongoing movement to [[codification (linguistics)|codify]] a separate Montenegrin standard. Serbo-Croatian thus generally goes by the names [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], and sometimes [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] and [[Bunjevac dialect|Bunjevac]].<ref>\"The same language [Croatian] is referred to by different names, Serbian (srpski), Serbo-Croat (in Croatia: hrvatsko-srpski), Bosnian (bosanski), based on political and ethnic grounds. [\u2026] the names Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian are politically determined and refer to the same language with possible slight variations.\" ({{Harvnb | Brown | Anderson | 2006 | p = 294}})</ref>\n\nLike other South Slavic languages, Serbo-Croatian has a simple [[Serbo-Croatian phonology|phonology]], with the common five-vowel system and twenty-five consonants. Its [[Serbo-Croatian grammar|grammar]] evolved from [[History of the Slavic languages|Common Slavic]], with complex [[inflection]], preserving seven [[grammatical case]]s in nouns, pronouns, and adjectives. Verbs exhibit [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] or [[perfective aspect]], with a moderately complex tense system. Serbo-Croatian is a [[pro-drop language]] with flexible word order, [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] being the default. It can be written in [[Serbian Cyrillic]] or [[Gaj's Latin alphabet]], whose thirty letters mutually map one-to-one, and the [[orthography]] is highly [[Phonemic orthography|phonemic]] in all standards.\n\n== Name ==\nThroughout the history of the South Slavs, the vernacular, literary, and written languages (e.g. Chakavian, Kajkavian, Shtokavian) of the various regions and ethnicities developed and diverged independently.

Serbian minorities are found in [[North Macedonia]] and in [[Romania]]. In Serbia, there are about 760,000 second-language speakers of Serbian, including Hungarians in [[Vojvodina]] and the 400,000 estimated Roma. Familiarity of [[Kosovo Albanians]] with Serbian in [[Kosovo]] varies depending on age and education, and exact numbers are not available.\n\nCroatian is spoken by roughly 4.8 million, including some 575,000 in Bosnia and Herzegovina. A small Croatian minority that lives in Italy, known as [[Molise Croats]], have somewhat preserved traces of the Croatian language. In Croatia, 170,000, mostly [[Italians]] and [[Hungarians]], use it as a [[second language]].\n\nBosnian is spoken by 2.2 million people, chiefly [[Bosniaks]], including about 220,000 in Serbia and Montenegro.\n\nThe notion of Montenegrin as a separate standard from Serbian is relatively recent. In the 2003 census, around 150,000 Montenegrins, of the country's 620,000, declared Montenegrin as their native language. That figure is likely to increase, due to the country's independence and strong institutional backing of the Montenegrin language.\n\nSerbo-Croatian is also a [[second language]] of many [[Slovenians]] and [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]], especially those born during the time of Yugoslavia. According to the 2002 Census, Serbo-Croatian and its variants have the largest number of speakers of the minority languages in Slovenia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inv.si/DocDir/Publikacije-PDF/Raziskovalna%20porocila/Raziskava_Polozaj_in_status_pripadnikov_narodov_nekdanje_Jugoslavije_v_RS.pdf| title=Raziskava Polo\u017eaj in status pripadnikov narodov nekdanje Jugoslavije vRS.pdf|language=Slovenian}}</ref>\n\nOutside the Balkans, there are over 2 million native speakers of the language(s), especially in countries which are frequent targets of immigration, such as [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Chile]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Italy]], [[Sweden]], and the [[United States]].\n\n== Grammar ==\n[[File:Gramatika i stilistika hrvatskoga ili srpskoga knjizevnoga jezika.JPG|thumb|[[Tomislav Mareti\u0107]]'s 1899 Grammar of Croatian or Serbian.]]\n{{Further|Serbo-Croatian grammar}}\n\nSerbo-Croatian is a highly [[inflected language]]. Traditional grammars list seven [[Grammatical case|cases]] for [[noun]]s and [[adjective]]s: [[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Genitive case|genitive]], [[Dative case|dative]], [[Accusative case|accusative]], [[Vocative case|vocative]], [[Locative case|locative]], and [[Instrumental case|instrumental]], reflecting the original seven cases of [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]], and indeed older forms of Serbo-Croatian itself. However, in modern [[Shtokavian dialect|Shtokavian]] the locative has almost merged into dative (the only difference is based on accent in some cases), and the other cases can be shown declining; namely:\n* For all nouns and adjectives, the instrumental, dative, and locative forms are identical (at least orthographically) in the plural: ''\u017eenama'', ''\u017eenama'', ''\u017eenama''; ''o\u010dima'', ''o\u010dima'', ''o\u010dima''; ''rije\u010dima'', ''rije\u010dima'', ''rije\u010dima''.\n* There is an accentual difference between the genitive [[singular (grammatical number)|singular]] and genitive [[plural]] of masculine and neuter nouns, which are otherwise homonyms (''seljaka'', ''seljaka'') except that on occasion an \"a\" (which might or might not appear in the singular) is filled between the last letter of the root and the genitive plural ending (''kapitalizma'', ''kapitalizama'').\n* The old instrumental ending \"ju\" of the feminine consonant stems and in some cases the \"a\" of the genitive plural of certain other sorts of feminine nouns is fast yielding to \"i\": ''no\u0107i'' instead of ''no\u0107ju'', ''borbi'' instead of ''boraba'' and so forth.\n* Almost every Shtokavian number is indeclinable, and numbers after prepositions have not been declined for a long time.\n\nLike most Slavic languages, there are mostly three [[Grammatical gender|genders]] for nouns: masculine, feminine, and neuter, a distinction which is still present even in the plural (unlike [[Russian language|Russian]] and, in part, the [[Chakavian dialect|\u010cakavian dialect]]). They also have two [[Grammatical number|numbers]]: singular and plural. However, some consider there to be three numbers ([[paucal]] or ''dual,'' too), since (still preserved in closely related [[Slovene language|Slovene]]) after two (''dva'', ''dvije''/''dve''), three (''tri'') and four (''\u010detiri''), and all numbers ending in them (e.g. twenty-two, ninety-three, one hundred four) the genitive singular is used, and after all other numbers five (''pet'') and up, the genitive plural is used. (The number one [''jedan''] is treated as an adjective.) Adjectives are placed in front of the noun they modify and must agree in both case and number with it.\n\nThere are seven [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] for verbs: [[past tense|past]], [[present tense|present]], [[future tense|future]], exact future, [[aorist]], [[imperfect]], and [[pluperfect]]; and three [[Grammatical mood|moods]]: [[indicative]], [[Imperative mood|imperative]], and [[conditional mood|conditional]]. However, the latter three tenses are typically used only in Shtokavian writing, and the time sequence of the exact future is more commonly formed through an alternative construction.\n\nIn addition, like most Slavic languages, the Shtokavian verb also has one of two [[Grammatical aspect|aspects]]: [[Perfective aspect|perfective]] or [[Imperfective aspect|imperfective]]. Most verbs come in pairs, with the perfective verb being created out of the imperfective by adding a [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] or making a stem change. The imperfective aspect typically indicates that the action is unfinished, in progress, or repetitive; while the perfective aspect typically denotes that the action was completed, instantaneous, or of limited duration. Some \u0160tokavian tenses (namely, aorist and imperfect) favor a particular aspect (but they are rarer or absent in \u010cakavian and Kajkavian). Actually, aspects \"compensate\" for the relative lack of tenses, because aspect of the verb determines whether the act is completed or in progress in the referred time.\n\n== Phonology ==\n{{Main|Serbo-Croatian phonology}}\n\n=== Vowels ===\nThe Serbo-Croatian [[vowel]] system is simple, with only five vowels in Shtokavian. All vowels are [[monophthong]]s. The oral vowels are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! '''Latin script'''\n! '''Cyrillic script'''\n! '''[[help:IPA|IPA]]'''\n! '''Description'''\n!

In a word, vowels can be long in the stressed syllable and the syllables following it, never in the ones preceding it.\n\n=== Consonants ===\nThe [[consonant]] system is more complicated, and its characteristic features are series of [[affricate]] and [[Palatal consonant|palatal]] consonants. As in English, [[voice (phonetics)|voice]] is [[phoneme|phonemic]], but [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]] is not.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! '''Latin script'''\n! '''Cyrillic script'''\n!

All the consonants are voiced if the last consonant is normally voiced or voiceless if the last consonant is normally voiceless. This rule does not apply to [[approximant]]s{{spaced ndash}}a consonant cluster may contain voiced approximants and voiceless consonants; as well as to foreign words (''Washington'' would be transcribed as ''Va\u0161inGton''), personal names and when consonants are not inside of one syllable.\n\n{{IPA|/r/}} can be syllabic, playing the role of the syllable nucleus in certain words (occasionally, it can even have a long accent). For example, the [[tongue-twister]] ''navrh brda vrba mrda'' involves four words with syllabic {{IPA|/r/}}. A similar feature exists in [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]. Very rarely other sonorants can be syllabic, like {{IPA|/l/}} (in ''bicikl''), {{IPA|/\u028e/}} (surname ''\u0160tarklj''), {{IPA|/n/}} (unit ''njutn''), as well as {{IPA|/m/}}  and {{IPA|/\u0272/}} in [[slang]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n=== Pitch accent ===\n{{Further|Pitch accent#Serbo-Croatian|Serbo-Croatian phonology#Pitch accent}}\n\nApart from [[Slovene language|Slovene]], Serbo-Croatian is the only Slavic language with a [[pitch accent]] (simple [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]]) system. This feature is present in some other [[Indo-European languages]], such as [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and [[Ancient Greek]]. Neo-Shtokavian Serbo-Croatian, which is used as the basis for standard Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin, and Serbian, has four \"accents\", which involve either a [[Tone contour|rising or falling tone]] on either long or short vowels, with optional post-tonic lengths:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Serbo-Croatian accent system\n|-\n!Slavicist<br />symbol!![[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]<br />symbol!!Description\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|'''e'''||{{IPA|[e]}}||align=\"left\"|non-tonic short vowel\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|'''\u0113'''||{{IPA|[e\u02d0]}}||align=\"left\"|non-tonic long vowel\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|'''\u00e8'''||{{IPA|[\u011b]}}||align=\"left\"|short vowel with rising tone\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|'''\u00e9'''||{{IPA|[\u011b\u02d0]}}||align=\"left\"|long vowel with rising tone\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|'''\u0205'''||{{IPA|[\u00ea]}}||align=\"left\"|short vowel with falling tone\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|'''\u0207'''||{{IPA|[\u00ea\u02d0]}}||align=\"left\"|long vowel with falling tone\n|}\n\nThe tone stressed vowels can be approximated in English with ''set'' vs. ''setting?'' said in isolation for a short tonic ''e,'' or ''leave'' vs. ''leaving?'' for a long tonic ''i,'' due to the [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] of final stressed syllables in English.\n\nGeneral accent rules in the standard language:\n\n# Monosyllabic words may have only a falling tone (or no accent at all \u2013 [[enclitic]]s);\n# Falling tone may occur only on the first syllable of polysyllabic words;\n# Accent can never occur on the last syllable of polysyllabic words.\n\nThere are no other rules for accent placement, thus the accent of every word must be learned individually; furthermore, in inflection, accent shifts are common, both in type and position (the so-called \"[[mobile paradigm]]s\"). The second rule is not strictly obeyed, especially in borrowed words.\n\nComparative and historical linguistics offers some clues for memorising the accent position: If one compares many standard Serbo-Croatian words to e.g. [[cognate]] Russian words, the accent in the Serbo-Croatian word will be one syllable before the one in the Russian word, with the rising tone. Historically, the rising tone appeared when the place of the accent shifted to the preceding syllable (the so-called \"Neoshtokavian retraction\"), but the quality of this new accent was different \u2013 its melody still \"gravitated\" towards the original syllable. Most Shtokavian dialects (Neoshtokavian) dialects underwent this shift, but Chakavian, Kajkavian and the Old Shtokavian dialects did not.\n\nAccent diacritics are not used in the ordinary orthography, but only in the linguistic or language-learning literature (e.g. dictionaries, orthography and grammar books). However, there are very few [[minimal pair]]s where an error in accent can lead to misunderstanding.\n\n== Orthography ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}\nSerbo-Croatian orthography is almost entirely phonetic. Thus, most words should be spelled as they are pronounced. In practice, the writing system does not take into account [[allophone]]s which occur as a result of interaction between words:\n* bit \u0107e{{spaced ndash}}pronounced ''bi\u0107e'' (and only written separately in Bosnian and Croatian)\n* od toga{{spaced ndash}}pronounced ''otoga'' (in many vernaculars)\n* iz \u010dega{{spaced ndash}}pronounced ''i\u0161\u010dega'' (in many vernaculars)\n\nAlso, there are some exceptions, mostly applied to foreign words and compounds, that favor morphological/etymological over phonetic spelling:\n* postdiplomski (postgraduate){{spaced ndash}}pronounced ''pozdiplomski''\n\nOne systemic exception is that the consonant clusters '''ds''' and '''d\u0161''' are not respelled as '''ts''' and '''t\u0161''' (although ''d'' tends to be unvoiced in normal speech in such clusters):\n* predstava (show)\n* od\u0161teta (damages)\n\nOnly a few words are intentionally \"misspelled\", mostly in order to resolve ambiguity:\n* \u0161eststo (six hundred){{spaced ndash}}pronounced ''\u0161esto'' (to avoid confusion with \"\u0161esto\" [sixth])\n* prstni (adj., finger){{spaced ndash}}pronounced ''prsni'' (to avoid confusion with \"prsni\" [adj., chest])\n\n=== Writing systems ===\n{{Main|Gaj's Latin alphabet|Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Yugoslav Braille}}\nThrough history, this language has been written in a number of writing systems:\n* [[Glagolitic alphabet]], chiefly in [[Croatia]].\n* [[Arabic alphabet]] (mostly in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]).\n* [[Cyrillic script]].\n* various modifications of the [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] and [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] alphabets.\n\nThe oldest texts since the 11th century are in [[Glagolitic]], and the oldest preserved text written completely in the Latin alphabet is {{lang|sh-Latn|Red i zakon sestara reda Svetog Dominika}}, from 1345. The Arabic alphabet had been used by [[Bosniaks]]; Greek writing is out of use there, and Arabic and Glagolitic persisted so far partly in religious liturgies.\n\nToday, it is written in both the [[Latin script|Latin]] and [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] scripts. Serbian and [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] variants use both alphabets, while Croatian uses the Latin only.\n\nLatin script has become more and more popular in Serbia, as it is easy to input on phones and computers.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Crosby |first1=Alan |last2=Martinovi\u0107 |first2=Iva |title=In The Age Of The Internet, Serbia Aims To Keep Its Cyrillic Alive |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/in-the-age-of-the-internet-serbia-aims-to-keep-its-cyrillic-alive/29458055.html |accessdate=5 September 2018 |publisher=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] |date=August 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Serbian Cyrillic alphabet was revised by [[Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107]] in the 19th century.\n\nThe Croatian Latin alphabet ({{lang|sh|[[Gaj's Latin alphabet|Gajica]]}}) followed suit shortly afterwards, when [[Ljudevit Gaj]] defined it as standard [[Latin]] with five extra letters that had [[diacritic]]s, apparently borrowing much from [[Czech language|Czech]], but also from [[Polish language|Polish]], and inventing the unique [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] {{angbr|lj}}, {{angbr|nj}} and {{angbr|d\u017e}}. These digraphs are represented as {{angbr|[[cedilla|\u013c]]}}, {{angbr|[[\u0144]]}} and {{angbr|[[\u01f5]]}} respectively in the {{lang|sh|Rje\u010dnik hrvatskog ili srpskog jezika}}, published by the former [[Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts]] in [[Zagreb]].<ref>{{in lang|sh}} Gramatika hrvatskosrpskoga jezika, Group of Authors (Ivan Brabec, Mate Hraste and Sreten \u017divkovi\u0107), Zagreb, 1968.</ref> The latter digraphs, however, are unused in the literary standard of the language. All in all, this makes Serbo-Croatian the only Slavic language to officially use both the Latin and Cyrillic scripts, albeit the Latin version is more commonly used.\n\nIn both cases, spelling is phonetic and spellings in the two alphabets map to each other one-to-one:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''Latin to Cyrillic'''\n| A || a || B || b || C || c || \u010c || \u010d || \u0106 || \u0107 || D || d || D\u017e || d\u017e || \u0110 || \u0111 || E || e || F || f || G || g || H || h || I || i || J || j || K || k\n|-\n| \u0410 || \u0430 || \u0411 || \u0431 || \u0426 || \u0446 || \u0427 || \u0447 || \u040b || \u045b || \u0414 || \u0434 || \u040f || \u045f || \u0402 || \u0452 || \u0415 || \u0435 || \u0424 || \u0444 || \u0413 || \u0433 || \u0425 || \u0445 || \u0418 || \u0438 || \u0408 || \u0458 || \u041a || \u043a\n|-\n| colspan=\"30\" style=\"height: 2px;\" |\n|-\n| L || l || Lj || lj || M || m || N || n || Nj || nj || O || o || P || p || R || r || S || s || \u0160 || \u0161 || T || t || U || u || V || v || Z || z || \u017d || \u017e\n|-\n| \u041b || \u043b || \u0409 || \u0459 || \u041c || \u043c || \u041d || \u043d || \u040a || \u045a || \u041e || \u043e || \u041f || \u043f || \u0420 || \u0440 || \u0421 || \u0441 || \u0428 || \u0448 || \u0422 || \u0442 || \u0423 || \u0443 || \u0412 || \u0432 || \u0417 || \u0437 || \u0416 || \u0436\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''Cyrillic to Latin'''\n| \u0410 || \u0430 || \u0411 || \u0431 || \u0412 || \u0432 || \u0413 || \u0433 || \u0414 || \u0434 || \u0402 || \u0452 || \u0415 || \u0435 || \u0416 || \u0436 || \u0417 || \u0437 || \u0418 || \u0438 || \u0408 || \u0458 || \u041a || \u043a || \u041b || \u043b || \u0409 || \u0459 || \u041c || \u043c\n|-\n| A || a || B || b || V || v || G || g || D || d || \u0110 || \u0111 || E || e || \u017d || \u017e || Z || z || I || i || J || j || K || k || L || l || Lj || lj || M || m\n|-\n| colspan=\"30\" style=\"height: 2px;\" |\n|-\n| \u041d || \u043d || \u040a || \u045a || \u041e || \u043e || \u041f || \u043f || \u0420 || \u0440 || \u0421 || \u0441 || \u0422 || \u0442 || \u040b || \u045b || \u0423 || \u0443 || \u0424 || \u0444 || \u0425 || \u0445 || \u0426 || \u0446 || \u0427 || \u0447 || \u040f || \u045f || \u0428 || \u0448\n|-\n| N || n || Nj || nj || O || o || P || p || R || r || S || s || T || t || \u0106 || \u0107 || U || u || F || f || H || h || C || c || \u010c || \u010d || D\u017e || d\u017e || \u0160 || \u0161\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em;\"\n|+ '''Sample collation'''\n! colspan=\"2\" | Latin collation order\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 1em;\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Cyrillic<br />collation<br />order\n|-\n!

In crosswords, they are put into a single square, and in [[sorting]], lj follows l and nj follows n, except in a few words where the individual letters are pronounced separately. For instance, ''nad\u017eiv(j)eti'' \"to outlive\" is composed of the prefix {{lang|sh-Latn|nad-}} \"out, over\" and the verb {{lang|sh-Latn|\u017eiv(j)eti}} \"to live\". The Cyrillic alphabet avoids such ambiguity by providing a single letter for each phoneme: {{lang|sh-Cyrl|\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0436\u0438\u0432(\u0458)\u0435\u0442\u0438}}.\n\n''\u0110'' used to be commonly written as ''Dj'' on typewriters, but that practice led to too many ambiguities. It is also used on car [[license plate]]s. Today ''Dj'' is often used again in place of ''\u0110'' on the Internet as a replacement due to the lack of installed Serbo-Croat keyboard layouts.\n\n[[Unicode]] has separate characters for the digraphs lj (\u01c7, \u01c8, \u01c9), nj (\u01ca, \u01cb, \u01cc) and d\u017e (\u01c4, \u01c5, \u01c6).\n\n== Dialects ==\n{{Main|Dialects of Serbo-Croatian}}\n{{See also|Dialect continuum#South Slavic continuum|label1=South Slavic dialect continuum}}\nSouth Slavic historically formed a [[Dialect continuum#South Slavic continuum|dialect continuum]], i.e. each dialect has some similarities with the neighboring one, and differences grow with distance. However, migrations from the 16th to 18th centuries resulting from the spread of [[Ottoman Empire]] on the Balkans have caused large-scale population displacement that broke the dialect continuum into many geographical pockets. Migrations in the 20th century, primarily caused by [[urbanization]] and wars, also contributed to the reduction of dialectal differences.\n\nThe primary dialects are named after the most common question word for ''what'': [[Shtokavian dialect|Shtokavian]] uses the pronoun ''\u0161to'' or ''\u0161ta'', [[Chakavian dialect|Chakavian]] uses ''\u010da'' or ''ca'', [[Kajkavian dialect|Kajkavian (''kajkavski'')]], ''kaj'' or ''kej''. In native terminology they are referred to as ''nar(j)e\u010dje'', which would be equivalent of \"group of dialects\", whereas their many subdialects are referred to as ''dijalekti ''\"dialects\" or ''govori ''\"speeches\".\n\nThe pluricentric Serbo-Croatian standard language and all four contemporary standard variants [[Ausbausprache#Interrelation of the abstand and ausbau statuses|are based]] on the [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect|Eastern Herzegovinian]] subdialect of Neo-Shtokavian. Other dialects are not taught in schools or used by the state media. The [[Torlakian dialect]] is often added to the list, though sources usually note that it is a transitional dialect between Shtokavian and the Bulgaro-Macedonian dialects.\n\n{|\n|[[File:Serbo croatian dialects historical distribution 2.png|thumb|Likely distribution of major dialects prior to the 16th-century migrations]]\n|[[File:Shtokavian subdialects1988 incl Slovenia.png|thumb|Shtokavian subdialects (Pavle Ivi\u0107, 1988).

In the past, Chakavian and Kajkavian dialects were spoken on a much larger territory, but have been replaced by \u0160tokavian during the period of migrations caused by Ottoman Turkish conquest of the Balkans in the 15th and the 16th centuries. These migrations caused the koin\u00e9isation of the Shtokavian dialects, that used to form the West Shtokavian (more closer and transitional towards the neighbouring Chakavian and Kajkavian dialects) and East Shtokavian (transitional towards the Torlakian and the whole Bulgaro-Macedonian area) dialect bundles, and their subsequent spread at the expense of Chakavian and Kajkavian. As a result, \u0160tokavian now covers an area larger than all the other dialects combined, and continues to make its progress in the enclaves where non-literary dialects are still being spoken.<ref>E.g., big coastal Croatian cities [[Rijeka]] and [[Split (city)|Split]] together with their hinterland become basically completely \u0160tokavianised during the 20th century, which had been \u010cakavian-speaking urban centres.</ref>\n\nThe differences among the dialects can be illustrated on the example of [[Schleicher's fable]]. Diacritic signs are used to show the difference in accents and prosody, which are often quite significant, but which are not reflected in the usual orthography.\n\n{{Clear}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-5}}\n:'''Neo\u0161tokavian Ijekavian/Ekavian'''\n\n: \u00d3vca i k\u00f2nji\n\n:\u00d3vca koja n\u00edje \u00ecmala v\u0215n\u0113 v\u0209d(j)ela je k\u00f2nje na br(ij)\u00e9gu.

And the sheep has no wool\".\n\n: Having heard this, the sheep fled into the plain.\n\n{{col-5}}\n\n{{col-end}}\n\n=== Division by ''jat'' reflex ===\n{{Main|yat}}\n\nA basic distinction among the dialects is in the reflex of the long [[Proto-Slavic language|Common Slavic]] vowel ''[[yat|jat]]'', usually transcribed as *\u011b. Depending on the reflex, the dialects are divided into Ikavian, Ekavian, and Ijekavian, with the reflects of ''jat'' being /i/, /e/, and /ije/ or /je/ respectively. The long and short ''jat'' is reflected as long or short */i/ and /e/ in Ikavian and Ekavian, but Ijekavian dialects introduce a ''ije''/''je'' alternation to retain a distinction.\n\nStandard Croatian and Bosnian are based on Ijekavian, whereas Serbian uses both Ekavian and Ijekavian forms (Ijekavian for Bosnian Serbs, Ekavian for most of Serbia). Influence of standard language through state media and education has caused non-standard varieties to lose ground to the literary forms.\n\nThe jat-reflex rules are not without exception. For example, when short ''jat'' is preceded by ''r'', in most Ijekavian dialects developed into /re/ or, occasionally, /ri/. The prefix ''pr\u011b-'' (\"trans-, over-\") when long became ''pre-'' in eastern Ijekavian dialects but to ''prije-'' in western dialects; in Ikavian pronunciation, it also evolved into ''pre-'' or ''prije-'' due to potential ambiguity with ''pri-'' (\"approach, come close to\"). For verbs that had ''-\u011bti '' in their infinitive, the past participle ending ''-\u011bl'' evolved into ''-io'' in Ijekavian Neo\u0161tokavian.\n\nThe following are some examples:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!English\n!Predecessor\n!Ekavian\n!Ikavian\n!Ijekavian\n!Ijekavian development\n|-\n|beautiful\n|*l\u011bp\n|lep\n|lip\n|lijep\n| rowspan=\"2\"| long ''\u011b'' \u2192 ''ije''\n|-\n|time\n|*vr\u011bme\n|vreme\n|vrime\n|vrijeme\n|-\n|faith\n|*v\u011bra\n|vera\n|vira\n|vjera\n|short ''\u011b'' \u2192 ''je''\n|-\n|crossing\n|*pr\u011blaz\n|prelaz\n|pr\u0435laz ''or''<br />prijelaz\n|pr\u0435laz ''or''<br />prijelaz\n|''pr'' + long ''\u011b'' \u2192 ''prije''<!--Does the /p/ really matter?-->\n|-\n|times\n|*vr\u011bmena\n|vremena\n|vrimena\n|vremena\n| rowspan=\"2\"| ''r'' + short ''\u011b'' \u2192 ''re''\n|-\n|need\n|*tr\u011bbati\n|trebati\n|tribat(i)\n|trebati\n|-\n|heat\n|*gr\u011bjati\n|grejati\n|grijati\n|grijati\n|''r'' + short ''\u011b'' \u2192 ''ri''\n|-\n|saw\n|*vid\u011bl\n|video\n|vidio\n|vidio\n|''\u011bl'' \u2192 ''io''\n|-\n|village\n|*selo\n|selo\n|selo\n|selo\n|''e'' in root, not ''\u011b''\n|}\n\n== Present sociolinguistic situation ==\nThe nature and classification of Serbo-Croatian has been the subject of long-standing sociolinguistic debate.

However, it is the case with other pluricentric languages.{{Sfn | Ammon | 1995 | pp = 154\u2013174}} A comparison is made to the closely related [[North Germanic languages]] (or dialects, if one prefers), though these are not fully mutually intelligible as the Serbo-Croatian standards are. A closer comparison may be [[General American]] and [[Received Pronunciation]] in English, which are closer to each other than the latter is to other dialects which are subsumed under \"British English\".\n:*Since the Croatian language as recorded in [[Marin Dr\u017ei\u0107|Dr\u017ei\u0107]] and [[Ivan Gunduli\u0107|Gunduli\u0107]]'s works (16th and 17th centuries) is virtually the same as the contemporary standard Croatian (understandable archaisms apart), it is evident that the 19th-century formal standardization was just the final touch in the process that, as far as the Croatian language is concerned, had lasted more than three centuries. The radical break with the past, characteristic of modern Serbian (whose vernacular was likely not as similar to Croatian as it is today), is a trait completely at variance with Croatian linguistic history. In short, formal standardization processes for Croatian and Serbian had coincided chronologically (and, one could add, ideologically), but they haven't produced a unified standard language. [[Ivan Gunduli\u0107|Gunduli\u0107]] did not write in \"Serbo-Croatian\", nor did [[August \u0160enoa]]. [[Marko Maruli\u0107]] and [[Marin Dr\u017ei\u0107]] wrote in a sophisticated idiom of the Croatian language some 300\u2013350 years before \"Serbo-Croatian\" ideology appeared. Maruli\u0107 explicitly called his \u010cakavian-written ''Judita'' as ''u uerish haruacchi slosena'' (\"arranged in Croatian stanzas\") in 1501, and the \u0160tokavian grammar and dictionary of [[Bartol Ka\u0161i\u0107]] written in 1604 unambiguously identifies the ethnonyms ''Slavic'' and ''Illyrian'' with ''Croatian''.\n\nThe linguistic debate in this region is more about politics than about linguistics per se.\n\nThe topic of language for writers from Dalmatia and Dubrovnik prior to the 19th century made a distinction only between speakers of Italian or Slavic, since those were the two main groups that inhabited Dalmatian city-states at that time. Whether someone spoke Croatian or Serbian was not an important distinction then, as the two languages were not distinguished by most speakers.\n\nHowever, most intellectuals and writers from Dalmatia who used the \u0160tokavian dialect and practiced the Catholic faith saw themselves as part of a Croatian nation as far back as the mid-16th to 17th centuries, some 300 years before Serbo-Croatian ideology appeared. Their loyalty was first and foremost to Catholic Christendom, but when they professed an ethnic identity, they referred to themselves as \"Slovin\" and \"Illyrian\" (a sort of forerunner of Catholic baroque [[pan-Slavism]]) '''and''' [[Croats|Croat]]{{spaced ndash}}these 30-odd writers over the span of c. 350 years always saw themselves as Croats first and never as part of a Serbian nation. It should also be noted that, in the pre-national era, Catholic religious orientation did not necessarily equate with Croat ethnic identity in Dalmatia. A Croatian follower of Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107, [[Ivan Broz]], noted that for a Dalmatian to identify oneself as a Serb was seen as foreign as identifying oneself as Macedonian or Greek. [[Vatroslav Jagi\u0107]] pointed out in 1864:\n\n{{poemquote|As I have mentioned in the preface, history knows only two national names in these parts\u2014Croatian and Serbian. As far as Dubrovnik is concerned, the Serbian name was never in use; on the contrary, the Croatian name was frequently used and gladly referred to ...\n\nAt the end of the 15th century [in Dubrovnik and Dalmatia], sermons and poems were exquisitely crafted in the Croatian language by those men whose names are widely renowned by deep learning and piety.|''The History of the Croatian language'', [[Zagreb]], 1864.}}\n\nOn the other hand, the opinion of Jagi\u0107 from 1864 is argued not to have firm grounds. When Jagi\u0107 says \"Croatian\", he refers to a few cases referring to the Dubrovnik vernacular as ''ilirski'' (Illyrian). This was a common name for all Slavic vernaculars in Dalmatian cities among the Roman inhabitants. In the meantime, other written monuments are found that mention ''srpski'', ''lingua serviana'' (= Serbian), and some that mention Croatian.<ref name=\"Mladenovic 2004\">Mladenovic.

The nationalists among the Croats conflictingly claim either that they speak an entirely separate language from Serbs and Bosniaks or that these two peoples have, due to the longer lexicographic tradition among Croats, somehow \"borrowed\" their standard languages from them.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Bosniak nationalists claim that both Croats and Serbs have \"appropriated\" the [[Bosnian language]], since [[Ljudevit Gaj]] and [[Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107]] preferred the Neo\u0161tokavian-Ijekavian dialect, widely spoken in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], as the basis for language standardization, whereas the nationalists among the Serbs claim either that any divergence in the language is artificial, or claim that the [[Shtokavian dialect|\u0160tokavian dialect]] is theirs and the [[Chakavian dialect|\u010cakavian]] Croats'\u2014 in more extreme formulations Croats have \"taken\" or \"stolen\" their language from the Serbs. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nProponents of unity among Southern Slavs claim that there is a single language with normal dialectal variations. The term \"Serbo-Croatian\" (or synonyms) is not officially used in any of the successor countries of former Yugoslavia.\n\nIn Serbia, the Serbian standard has an official status countrywide, while both Serbian and Croatian are official in the province of [[Vojvodina]]. A large Bosniak minority is present in the southwest region of [[Sand\u017eak]], but the \"official recognition\" of Bosnian is moot.<ref>Official communique, 27 December 2004, Serbian Ministry of Education {{in lang|sr}}</ref> Bosnian is an optional course in 1st and 2nd grade of the elementary school, while it is also in official use in the municipality of [[Novi Pazar]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.novipazar.org.rs/sl/gl_06_2002.pdf |title= Op\u0161tinski slu\u017ebeni glasnik op\u0161tine Novi Pazar }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&nbsp;{{small|(65.8&nbsp;KB)}}, 30 April 2002, page 1</ref> However, its nomenclature is controversial, as there is incentive that it is referred to as \"Bosniak\" (''bo\u0161nja\u010dki'') rather than \"Bosnian\" (''bosanski'') (see [[Bosnian language#Controversy and recognition]] for details).\n\nCroatian is the official language of Croatia, while Serbian is also official in municipalities with significant Serb population.\n\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, all three standard languages are recorded as official but in practice and media, mostly Bosnian and Serbian are applied. Confrontations have on occasion been absurd.

The turbulent history of the area, particularly due to expansion of the [[Ottoman Empire]], resulted in a patchwork of dialectal and religious differences. Due to population migrations, [[Shtokavian]] became the most widespread language in the western Balkans, intruding westwards into the area previously occupied by [[Chakavian]] and [[Kajkavian]] (which further blend into [[Slovene language|Slovenian]] in the northwest). [[Bosniaks]], [[Croats]] and [[Serbs]] differ in religion and were historically often part of different cultural circles, although a large part of the nations have lived side by side under foreign overlords. During that period, the language was referred to under a variety of names, such as \"Slavic\" in general or \"Serbian\", \"Croatian\" or \"Bosnian\" in particular. In a classicizing manner, it was also referred to as \"Illyrian\".\n\nThe process of [[linguistic standardization]] of Serbo-Croatian was originally initiated in the mid-19th-century [[Vienna Literary Agreement]] by Croatian and Serbian writers and philologists, decades before a Yugoslav state was established.{{Sfn | Blum | 2002 | pp = 130\u2013132}} From the very beginning, there were slightly different literary Serbian and Croatian standards, although both were based on the same dialect of Shtokavian, [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect|Eastern Herzegovinian]]. In the 20th century, Serbo-Croatian served as the official language of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] (when it was called \"Serbo-Croato-Slovenian\"),<ref name=\"Busch2004\" /> and later as one of the official languages of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. The [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] affected language attitudes, so that [[Language secessionism#In Serbo-Croatian|social conceptions of the language separated]] on ethnic and political lines. Since the breakup of Yugoslavia, Bosnian has likewise been established as an official standard in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and there is an ongoing movement to [[codification (linguistics)|codify]] a separate Montenegrin standard. Serbo-Croatian thus generally goes by the names [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], and sometimes [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] and [[Bunjevac dialect|Bunjevac]].<ref>\"The same language [Croatian] is referred to by different names, Serbian (srpski), Serbo-Croat (in Croatia: hrvatsko-srpski), Bosnian (bosanski), based on political and ethnic grounds. [\u2026] the names Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian are politically determined and refer to the same language with possible slight variations.\" ({{Harvnb | Brown | Anderson | 2006 | p = 294}})</ref>\n\nLike other South Slavic languages, Serbo-Croatian has a simple [[Serbo-Croatian phonology|phonology]], with the common five-vowel system and twenty-five consonants. Its [[Serbo-Croatian grammar|grammar]] evolved from [[History of the Slavic languages|Common Slavic]], with complex [[inflection]], preserving seven [[grammatical case]]s in nouns, pronouns, and adjectives. Verbs exhibit [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] or [[perfective aspect]], with a moderately complex tense system. Serbo-Croatian is a [[pro-drop language]] with flexible word order, [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] being the default. It can be written in [[Serbian Cyrillic]] or [[Gaj's Latin alphabet]], whose thirty letters mutually map one-to-one, and the [[orthography]] is highly [[Phonemic orthography|phonemic]] in all standards.\n\n== Name ==\nThroughout the history of the South Slavs, the vernacular, literary, and written languages (e.g. Chakavian, Kajkavian, Shtokavian) of the various regions and ethnicities developed and diverged independently. Prior to the 19th century, they were collectively called \"Illyric\", \"Slavic\", \"Slavonian\", \"Bosnian\", \"Dalmatian\", \"Serbian\" or \"Croatian\".<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kordi\u0107, Snje\u017eana |authorlink=Snje\u017eana Kordi\u0107 |title=Moderne Nationalbezeichnungen und Texte aus vergangenen Jahrhunderten |trans-title=Modern nation names and texts in the past |url=http://www.zeitschrift-fuer-balkanologie.de/index.php/zfb/article/view/222/222 |language=German |journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Balkanologie |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=40\u201341 |year=2010 |issn=0044-2356 |ssrn=3440016 |id={{CROSBI|495349}}. {{ZDB|201058-6}} |archivedate=1 June 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601175024/http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/495349.MODERNE_NATIONALBEZEICHNUNGEN.PDF |accessdate=11 May 2014 }}</ref> Since the nineteenth century the term ''Illyrian'' or ''Illyric'' was used quite often (thus creating confusion with the [[Illyrian language]]).

However, in modern [[Shtokavian dialect|Shtokavian]] the locative has almost merged into dative (the only difference is based on accent in some cases), and the other cases can be shown declining; namely:\n* For all nouns and adjectives, the instrumental, dative, and locative forms are identical (at least orthographically) in the plural: ''\u017eenama'', ''\u017eenama'', ''\u017eenama''; ''o\u010dima'', ''o\u010dima'', ''o\u010dima''; ''rije\u010dima'', ''rije\u010dima'', ''rije\u010dima''.\n* There is an accentual difference between the genitive [[singular (grammatical number)|singular]] and genitive [[plural]] of masculine and neuter nouns, which are otherwise homonyms (''seljaka'', ''seljaka'') except that on occasion an \"a\" (which might or might not appear in the singular) is filled between the last letter of the root and the genitive plural ending (''kapitalizma'', ''kapitalizama'').\n* The old instrumental ending \"ju\" of the feminine consonant stems and in some cases the \"a\" of the genitive plural of certain other sorts of feminine nouns is fast yielding to \"i\": ''no\u0107i'' instead of ''no\u0107ju'', ''borbi'' instead of ''boraba'' and so forth.\n* Almost every Shtokavian number is indeclinable, and numbers after prepositions have not been declined for a long time.\n\nLike most Slavic languages, there are mostly three [[Grammatical gender|genders]] for nouns: masculine, feminine, and neuter, a distinction which is still present even in the plural (unlike [[Russian language|Russian]] and, in part, the [[Chakavian dialect|\u010cakavian dialect]]). They also have two [[Grammatical number|numbers]]: singular and plural. However, some consider there to be three numbers ([[paucal]] or ''dual,'' too), since (still preserved in closely related [[Slovene language|Slovene]]) after two (''dva'', ''dvije''/''dve''), three (''tri'') and four (''\u010detiri''), and all numbers ending in them (e.g. twenty-two, ninety-three, one hundred four) the genitive singular is used, and after all other numbers five (''pet'') and up, the genitive plural is used. (The number one [''jedan''] is treated as an adjective.) Adjectives are placed in front of the noun they modify and must agree in both case and number with it.\n\nThere are seven [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] for verbs: [[past tense|past]], [[present tense|present]], [[future tense|future]], exact future, [[aorist]], [[imperfect]], and [[pluperfect]]; and three [[Grammatical mood|moods]]: [[indicative]], [[Imperative mood|imperative]], and [[conditional mood|conditional]]. However, the latter three tenses are typically used only in Shtokavian writing, and the time sequence of the exact future is more commonly formed through an alternative construction.\n\nIn addition, like most Slavic languages, the Shtokavian verb also has one of two [[Grammatical aspect|aspects]]: [[Perfective aspect|perfective]] or [[Imperfective aspect|imperfective]]. Most verbs come in pairs, with the perfective verb being created out of the imperfective by adding a [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] or making a stem change. The imperfective aspect typically indicates that the action is unfinished, in progress, or repetitive; while the perfective aspect typically denotes that the action was completed, instantaneous, or of limited duration. Some \u0160tokavian tenses (namely, aorist and imperfect) favor a particular aspect (but they are rarer or absent in \u010cakavian and Kajkavian). Actually, aspects \"compensate\" for the relative lack of tenses, because aspect of the verb determines whether the act is completed or in progress in the referred time.\n\n== Phonology ==\n{{Main|Serbo-Croatian phonology}}\n\n=== Vowels ===\nThe Serbo-Croatian [[vowel]] system is simple, with only five vowels in Shtokavian. All vowels are [[monophthong]]s. The oral vowels are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! '''Latin script'''\n! '''Cyrillic script'''\n! '''[[help:IPA|IPA]]'''\n! '''Description'''\n!

In a word, vowels can be long in the stressed syllable and the syllables following it, never in the ones preceding it.\n\n=== Consonants ===\nThe [[consonant]] system is more complicated, and its characteristic features are series of [[affricate]] and [[Palatal consonant|palatal]] consonants. As in English, [[voice (phonetics)|voice]] is [[phoneme|phonemic]], but [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]] is not.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! '''Latin script'''\n! '''Cyrillic script'''\n!

All the consonants are voiced if the last consonant is normally voiced or voiceless if the last consonant is normally voiceless. This rule does not apply to [[approximant]]s{{spaced ndash}}a consonant cluster may contain voiced approximants and voiceless consonants; as well as to foreign words (''Washington'' would be transcribed as ''Va\u0161inGton''), personal names and when consonants are not inside of one syllable.\n\n{{IPA|/r/}} can be syllabic, playing the role of the syllable nucleus in certain words (occasionally, it can even have a long accent). For example, the [[tongue-twister]] ''navrh brda vrba mrda'' involves four words with syllabic {{IPA|/r/}}. A similar feature exists in [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]. Very rarely other sonorants can be syllabic, like {{IPA|/l/}} (in ''bicikl''), {{IPA|/\u028e/}} (surname ''\u0160tarklj''), {{IPA|/n/}} (unit ''njutn''), as well as {{IPA|/m/}}  and {{IPA|/\u0272/}} in [[slang]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n=== Pitch accent ===\n{{Further|Pitch accent#Serbo-Croatian|Serbo-Croatian phonology#Pitch accent}}\n\nApart from [[Slovene language|Slovene]], Serbo-Croatian is the only Slavic language with a [[pitch accent]] (simple [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]]) system. This feature is present in some other [[Indo-European languages]], such as [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and [[Ancient Greek]]. Neo-Shtokavian Serbo-Croatian, which is used as the basis for standard Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin, and Serbian, has four \"accents\", which involve either a [[Tone contour|rising or falling tone]] on either long or short vowels, with optional post-tonic lengths:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Serbo-Croatian accent system\n|-\n!Slavicist<br />symbol!![[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]<br />symbol!!Description\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|'''e'''||{{IPA|[e]}}||align=\"left\"|non-tonic short vowel\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|'''\u0113'''||{{IPA|[e\u02d0]}}||align=\"left\"|non-tonic long vowel\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|'''\u00e8'''||{{IPA|[\u011b]}}||align=\"left\"|short vowel with rising tone\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|'''\u00e9'''||{{IPA|[\u011b\u02d0]}}||align=\"left\"|long vowel with rising tone\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|'''\u0205'''||{{IPA|[\u00ea]}}||align=\"left\"|short vowel with falling tone\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|'''\u0207'''||{{IPA|[\u00ea\u02d0]}}||align=\"left\"|long vowel with falling tone\n|}\n\nThe tone stressed vowels can be approximated in English with ''set'' vs. ''setting?'' said in isolation for a short tonic ''e,'' or ''leave'' vs. ''leaving?'' for a long tonic ''i,'' due to the [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] of final stressed syllables in English.\n\nGeneral accent rules in the standard language:\n\n# Monosyllabic words may have only a falling tone (or no accent at all \u2013 [[enclitic]]s);\n# Falling tone may occur only on the first syllable of polysyllabic words;\n# Accent can never occur on the last syllable of polysyllabic words.\n\nThere are no other rules for accent placement, thus the accent of every word must be learned individually; furthermore, in inflection, accent shifts are common, both in type and position (the so-called \"[[mobile paradigm]]s\"). The second rule is not strictly obeyed, especially in borrowed words.\n\nComparative and historical linguistics offers some clues for memorising the accent position: If one compares many standard Serbo-Croatian words to e.g. [[cognate]] Russian words, the accent in the Serbo-Croatian word will be one syllable before the one in the Russian word, with the rising tone. Historically, the rising tone appeared when the place of the accent shifted to the preceding syllable (the so-called \"Neoshtokavian retraction\"), but the quality of this new accent was different \u2013 its melody still \"gravitated\" towards the original syllable. Most Shtokavian dialects (Neoshtokavian) dialects underwent this shift, but Chakavian, Kajkavian and the Old Shtokavian dialects did not.\n\nAccent diacritics are not used in the ordinary orthography, but only in the linguistic or language-learning literature (e.g. dictionaries, orthography and grammar books). However, there are very few [[minimal pair]]s where an error in accent can lead to misunderstanding.\n\n== Orthography ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}\nSerbo-Croatian orthography is almost entirely phonetic. Thus, most words should be spelled as they are pronounced. In practice, the writing system does not take into account [[allophone]]s which occur as a result of interaction between words:\n* bit \u0107e{{spaced ndash}}pronounced ''bi\u0107e'' (and only written separately in Bosnian and Croatian)\n* od toga{{spaced ndash}}pronounced ''otoga'' (in many vernaculars)\n* iz \u010dega{{spaced ndash}}pronounced ''i\u0161\u010dega'' (in many vernaculars)\n\nAlso, there are some exceptions, mostly applied to foreign words and compounds, that favor morphological/etymological over phonetic spelling:\n* postdiplomski (postgraduate){{spaced ndash}}pronounced ''pozdiplomski''\n\nOne systemic exception is that the consonant clusters '''ds''' and '''d\u0161''' are not respelled as '''ts''' and '''t\u0161''' (although ''d'' tends to be unvoiced in normal speech in such clusters):\n* predstava (show)\n* od\u0161teta (damages)\n\nOnly a few words are intentionally \"misspelled\", mostly in order to resolve ambiguity:\n* \u0161eststo (six hundred){{spaced ndash}}pronounced ''\u0161esto'' (to avoid confusion with \"\u0161esto\" [sixth])\n* prstni (adj., finger){{spaced ndash}}pronounced ''prsni'' (to avoid confusion with \"prsni\" [adj., chest])\n\n=== Writing systems ===\n{{Main|Gaj's Latin alphabet|Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Yugoslav Braille}}\nThrough history, this language has been written in a number of writing systems:\n* [[Glagolitic alphabet]], chiefly in [[Croatia]].\n* [[Arabic alphabet]] (mostly in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]).\n* [[Cyrillic script]].\n* various modifications of the [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] and [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] alphabets.\n\nThe oldest texts since the 11th century are in [[Glagolitic]], and the oldest preserved text written completely in the Latin alphabet is {{lang|sh-Latn|Red i zakon sestara reda Svetog Dominika}}, from 1345. The Arabic alphabet had been used by [[Bosniaks]]; Greek writing is out of use there, and Arabic and Glagolitic persisted so far partly in religious liturgies.\n\nToday, it is written in both the [[Latin script|Latin]] and [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] scripts.

In crosswords, they are put into a single square, and in [[sorting]], lj follows l and nj follows n, except in a few words where the individual letters are pronounced separately. For instance, ''nad\u017eiv(j)eti'' \"to outlive\" is composed of the prefix {{lang|sh-Latn|nad-}} \"out, over\" and the verb {{lang|sh-Latn|\u017eiv(j)eti}} \"to live\". The Cyrillic alphabet avoids such ambiguity by providing a single letter for each phoneme: {{lang|sh-Cyrl|\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0436\u0438\u0432(\u0458)\u0435\u0442\u0438}}.\n\n''\u0110'' used to be commonly written as ''Dj'' on typewriters, but that practice led to too many ambiguities. It is also used on car [[license plate]]s. Today ''Dj'' is often used again in place of ''\u0110'' on the Internet as a replacement due to the lack of installed Serbo-Croat keyboard layouts.\n\n[[Unicode]] has separate characters for the digraphs lj (\u01c7, \u01c8, \u01c9), nj (\u01ca, \u01cb, \u01cc) and d\u017e (\u01c4, \u01c5, \u01c6).\n\n== Dialects ==\n{{Main|Dialects of Serbo-Croatian}}\n{{See also|Dialect continuum#South Slavic continuum|label1=South Slavic dialect continuum}}\nSouth Slavic historically formed a [[Dialect continuum#South Slavic continuum|dialect continuum]], i.e. each dialect has some similarities with the neighboring one, and differences grow with distance. However, migrations from the 16th to 18th centuries resulting from the spread of [[Ottoman Empire]] on the Balkans have caused large-scale population displacement that broke the dialect continuum into many geographical pockets. Migrations in the 20th century, primarily caused by [[urbanization]] and wars, also contributed to the reduction of dialectal differences.\n\nThe primary dialects are named after the most common question word for ''what'': [[Shtokavian dialect|Shtokavian]] uses the pronoun ''\u0161to'' or ''\u0161ta'', [[Chakavian dialect|Chakavian]] uses ''\u010da'' or ''ca'', [[Kajkavian dialect|Kajkavian (''kajkavski'')]], ''kaj'' or ''kej''. In native terminology they are referred to as ''nar(j)e\u010dje'', which would be equivalent of \"group of dialects\", whereas their many subdialects are referred to as ''dijalekti ''\"dialects\" or ''govori ''\"speeches\".\n\nThe pluricentric Serbo-Croatian standard language and all four contemporary standard variants [[Ausbausprache#Interrelation of the abstand and ausbau statuses|are based]] on the [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect|Eastern Herzegovinian]] subdialect of Neo-Shtokavian. Other dialects are not taught in schools or used by the state media. The [[Torlakian dialect]] is often added to the list, though sources usually note that it is a transitional dialect between Shtokavian and the Bulgaro-Macedonian dialects.\n\n{|\n|[[File:Serbo croatian dialects historical distribution 2.png|thumb|Likely distribution of major dialects prior to the 16th-century migrations]]\n|[[File:Shtokavian subdialects1988 incl Slovenia.png|thumb|Shtokavian subdialects (Pavle Ivi\u0107, 1988). Yellow is the widespread Eastern Herzegovinian subdialect that forms the basis of all national standards, though it is not spoken natively in any of the capital cities.]]\n|[[File:Croatian dialects.PNG|thumb|Mid-20th-century distribution of dialects in Croatia]]\n|}\n\nThe Serbo-Croatian dialects differ not only in the question word they are named after, but also heavily in phonology, accentuation and intonation, case endings and tense system (morphology) and basic vocabulary. In the past, Chakavian and Kajkavian dialects were spoken on a much larger territory, but have been replaced by \u0160tokavian during the period of migrations caused by Ottoman Turkish conquest of the Balkans in the 15th and the 16th centuries. These migrations caused the koin\u00e9isation of the Shtokavian dialects, that used to form the West Shtokavian (more closer and transitional towards the neighbouring Chakavian and Kajkavian dialects) and East Shtokavian (transitional towards the Torlakian and the whole Bulgaro-Macedonian area) dialect bundles, and their subsequent spread at the expense of Chakavian and Kajkavian. As a result, \u0160tokavian now covers an area larger than all the other dialects combined, and continues to make its progress in the enclaves where non-literary dialects are still being spoken.<ref>E.g., big coastal Croatian cities [[Rijeka]] and [[Split (city)|Split]] together with their hinterland become basically completely \u0160tokavianised during the 20th century, which had been \u010cakavian-speaking urban centres.</ref>\n\nThe differences among the dialects can be illustrated on the example of [[Schleicher's fable]]. Diacritic signs are used to show the difference in accents and prosody, which are often quite significant, but which are not reflected in the usual orthography.\n\n{{Clear}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-5}}\n:'''Neo\u0161tokavian Ijekavian/Ekavian'''\n\n: \u00d3vca i k\u00f2nji\n\n:\u00d3vca koja n\u00edje \u00ecmala v\u0215n\u0113 v\u0209d(j)ela je k\u00f2nje na br(ij)\u00e9gu.

Depending on the reflex, the dialects are divided into Ikavian, Ekavian, and Ijekavian, with the reflects of ''jat'' being /i/, /e/, and /ije/ or /je/ respectively. The long and short ''jat'' is reflected as long or short */i/ and /e/ in Ikavian and Ekavian, but Ijekavian dialects introduce a ''ije''/''je'' alternation to retain a distinction.\n\nStandard Croatian and Bosnian are based on Ijekavian, whereas Serbian uses both Ekavian and Ijekavian forms (Ijekavian for Bosnian Serbs, Ekavian for most of Serbia). Influence of standard language through state media and education has caused non-standard varieties to lose ground to the literary forms.\n\nThe jat-reflex rules are not without exception. For example, when short ''jat'' is preceded by ''r'', in most Ijekavian dialects developed into /re/ or, occasionally, /ri/. The prefix ''pr\u011b-'' (\"trans-, over-\") when long became ''pre-'' in eastern Ijekavian dialects but to ''prije-'' in western dialects; in Ikavian pronunciation, it also evolved into ''pre-'' or ''prije-'' due to potential ambiguity with ''pri-'' (\"approach, come close to\").

However, it is the case with other pluricentric languages.{{Sfn | Ammon | 1995 | pp = 154\u2013174}} A comparison is made to the closely related [[North Germanic languages]] (or dialects, if one prefers), though these are not fully mutually intelligible as the Serbo-Croatian standards are. A closer comparison may be [[General American]] and [[Received Pronunciation]] in English, which are closer to each other than the latter is to other dialects which are subsumed under \"British English\".\n:*Since the Croatian language as recorded in [[Marin Dr\u017ei\u0107|Dr\u017ei\u0107]] and [[Ivan Gunduli\u0107|Gunduli\u0107]]'s works (16th and 17th centuries) is virtually the same as the contemporary standard Croatian (understandable archaisms apart), it is evident that the 19th-century formal standardization was just the final touch in the process that, as far as the Croatian language is concerned, had lasted more than three centuries. The radical break with the past, characteristic of modern Serbian (whose vernacular was likely not as similar to Croatian as it is today), is a trait completely at variance with Croatian linguistic history. In short, formal standardization processes for Croatian and Serbian had coincided chronologically (and, one could add, ideologically), but they haven't produced a unified standard language. [[Ivan Gunduli\u0107|Gunduli\u0107]] did not write in \"Serbo-Croatian\", nor did [[August \u0160enoa]]. [[Marko Maruli\u0107]] and [[Marin Dr\u017ei\u0107]] wrote in a sophisticated idiom of the Croatian language some 300\u2013350 years before \"Serbo-Croatian\" ideology appeared. Maruli\u0107 explicitly called his \u010cakavian-written ''Judita'' as ''u uerish haruacchi slosena'' (\"arranged in Croatian stanzas\") in 1501, and the \u0160tokavian grammar and dictionary of [[Bartol Ka\u0161i\u0107]] written in 1604 unambiguously identifies the ethnonyms ''Slavic'' and ''Illyrian'' with ''Croatian''.\n\nThe linguistic debate in this region is more about politics than about linguistics per se.\n\nThe topic of language for writers from Dalmatia and Dubrovnik prior to the 19th century made a distinction only between speakers of Italian or Slavic, since those were the two main groups that inhabited Dalmatian city-states at that time. Whether someone spoke Croatian or Serbian was not an important distinction then, as the two languages were not distinguished by most speakers.\n\nHowever, most intellectuals and writers from Dalmatia who used the \u0160tokavian dialect and practiced the Catholic faith saw themselves as part of a Croatian nation as far back as the mid-16th to 17th centuries, some 300 years before Serbo-Croatian ideology appeared. Their loyalty was first and foremost to Catholic Christendom, but when they professed an ethnic identity, they referred to themselves as \"Slovin\" and \"Illyrian\" (a sort of forerunner of Catholic baroque [[pan-Slavism]]) '''and''' [[Croats|Croat]]{{spaced ndash}}these 30-odd writers over the span of c. 350 years always saw themselves as Croats first and never as part of a Serbian nation. It should also be noted that, in the pre-national era, Catholic religious orientation did not necessarily equate with Croat ethnic identity in Dalmatia. A Croatian follower of Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107, [[Ivan Broz]], noted that for a Dalmatian to identify oneself as a Serb was seen as foreign as identifying oneself as Macedonian or Greek. [[Vatroslav Jagi\u0107]] pointed out in 1864:\n\n{{poemquote|As I have mentioned in the preface, history knows only two national names in these parts\u2014Croatian and Serbian. As far as Dubrovnik is concerned, the Serbian name was never in use; on the contrary, the Croatian name was frequently used and gladly referred to ...\n\nAt the end of the 15th century [in Dubrovnik and Dalmatia], sermons and poems were exquisitely crafted in the Croatian language by those men whose names are widely renowned by deep learning and piety.|''The History of the Croatian language'', [[Zagreb]], 1864.}}\n\nOn the other hand, the opinion of Jagi\u0107 from 1864 is argued not to have firm grounds. When Jagi\u0107 says \"Croatian\", he refers to a few cases referring to the Dubrovnik vernacular as ''ilirski'' (Illyrian). This was a common name for all Slavic vernaculars in Dalmatian cities among the Roman inhabitants. In the meantime, other written monuments are found that mention ''srpski'', ''lingua serviana'' (= Serbian), and some that mention Croatian.<ref name=\"Mladenovic 2004\">Mladenovic.

The nationalists among the Croats conflictingly claim either that they speak an entirely separate language from Serbs and Bosniaks or that these two peoples have, due to the longer lexicographic tradition among Croats, somehow \"borrowed\" their standard languages from them.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Bosniak nationalists claim that both Croats and Serbs have \"appropriated\" the [[Bosnian language]], since [[Ljudevit Gaj]] and [[Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107]] preferred the Neo\u0161tokavian-Ijekavian dialect, widely spoken in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], as the basis for language standardization, whereas the nationalists among the Serbs claim either that any divergence in the language is artificial, or claim that the [[Shtokavian dialect|\u0160tokavian dialect]] is theirs and the [[Chakavian dialect|\u010cakavian]] Croats'\u2014 in more extreme formulations Croats have \"taken\" or \"stolen\" their language from the Serbs. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nProponents of unity among Southern Slavs claim that there is a single language with normal dialectal variations. The term \"Serbo-Croatian\" (or synonyms) is not officially used in any of the successor countries of former Yugoslavia.\n\nIn Serbia, the Serbian standard has an official status countrywide, while both Serbian and Croatian are official in the province of [[Vojvodina]]. A large Bosniak minority is present in the southwest region of [[Sand\u017eak]], but the \"official recognition\" of Bosnian is moot.<ref>Official communique, 27 December 2004, Serbian Ministry of Education {{in lang|sr}}</ref> Bosnian is an optional course in 1st and 2nd grade of the elementary school, while it is also in official use in the municipality of [[Novi Pazar]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.novipazar.org.rs/sl/gl_06_2002.pdf |title= Op\u0161tinski slu\u017ebeni glasnik op\u0161tine Novi Pazar }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&nbsp;{{small|(65.8&nbsp;KB)}}, 30 April 2002, page 1</ref> However, its nomenclature is controversial, as there is incentive that it is referred to as \"Bosniak\" (''bo\u0161nja\u010dki'') rather than \"Bosnian\" (''bosanski'') (see [[Bosnian language#Controversy and recognition]] for details).\n\nCroatian is the official language of Croatia, while Serbian is also official in municipalities with significant Serb population.\n\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, all three standard languages are recorded as official but in practice and media, mostly Bosnian and Serbian are applied. Confrontations have on occasion been absurd.

Translators were employed from all regions of the former Yugoslavia and all national and regional variations were accepted, regardless of the nationality of the person on trial (sometimes against a defendent's objections), on the grounds of mutual intelligibility.<ref name=Prosecutor/>\n\n=== ISO classification ===\nSince the year 2000, the [[ISO]] classification only recognizes ''Serbo-Croatian'' as a '[[macrolanguage]]', since the original codes were removed from the [[ISO 639-1]] and [[ISO 639-2]] standards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_changes_bycode.php?code_ID=513|title=Codes for the representation of names of languages (Library of Congress)|website=www.loc.gov}}</ref> That left the [[ISO 639-3]] 'macrolanguage' (a book-keeping device in the [[ISO 639-3]] standard to keep track of which ISO 639-3 codes correspond with which ISO 639-2 codes)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://iso639-3.sil.org/code/hbs|title=hbs - ISO 639-3|website=iso639-3.sil.org}}</ref> stranded without a corresponding ISO 639-2 code.\n\n== Words of Serbo-Croatian origin ==\n: ''See [[:wikt:Category:English terms derived from Serbo-Croatian|Category:English terms derived from Serbo-Croatian]] on Wiktionary''\n*''[[Cravat]]'', from French ''cravate'' \"Croat\", by analogy with Flemish ''Krawaat'' and German ''Krabate'', from Serbo-Croatian ''Hrvat'',<ref>{{OED|cravat}}</ref> as cravats were characteristic of Croatian dress\n*''[[Polje]]'', from Serbo-Croatian ''polje'' \"field\"<ref>{{OED|polje}}</ref>\n*''[[Slivovitz]]'', from German ''Slibowitz'', from Bulgarian ''slivovitza'' or Serbo-Croatian ''\u0161ljivovica'' \"plum brandy\", from Old Slavic *sliva \"plum\" (cognate with English [[sloe]])<ref>{{OED|slovovitz}}</ref>\n*''[[Tamburitza]]'', Serbo-Croatian diminutive of ''tambura'', from Turkish, from Persian ''\u1e6damb\u016br'' \"[[tanbur]]\"<ref>{{OED|tamburitza}}</ref>\n*''[[Uvala (landform)|Uvala]]'', from Serbo-Croatian ''uvala'' \"hollow\"<ref>{{OED|uvala}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Language|Linguistics|Bosnia and Herzegovina|Croatia|Serbia}}\n* [[Ausbau languages]]\n* [[Comparison of standard Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin and Serbian]]\n* [[Declaration on the Common Language]] 2017\n* [[Dialects of Serbo-Croatian]]\n* [[Language secessionism#In Serbo-Croatian|Language secessionism in Serbo-Croatian]]\n* [[Pluricentric language#Serbo-Croatian|Pluricentric Serbo-Croatian language]]\n* [[Relative clause#Serbo-Croatian|Serbo-Croatian relative clauses]]\n* [[Serbo-Croatian kinship]]\n\n== Notes ==\n=== Explanatory notes ===\n{{notes\n| notes =\n{{efn\n| name = status\n| {{Kosovo-note}}\n}}\n}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== General sources ==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Alexander|first=Ronelle|title=Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian, a Grammar: With Sociolinguistic Commentary|year=2006|location=Madison|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6HTdZ5rxJ-cC|isbn=9780299211936}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Alexander|first=Ronelle|chapter=Language and Identity: The Fate of Serbo-Croatian|title=Entangled Histories of the Balkans|year=2013|volume=1|location=Leiden & Boston|publisher=Brill|pages=341\u2013417|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FGmJqMflYgoC |isbn=9789004250765}}\n* {{cite book|last=Ammon |first=Ulrich |year=1995 |language=German |title=Die deutsche Sprache in Deutschland, \u00d6sterreich und der Schweiz: das Problem der nationalen Variet\u00e4ten |trans-title=German Language in Germany, Austria and Switzerland: The Problem of National Varieties |location=Berlin & New York |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |page=575 |oclc=33981055 |ref= harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Blum |first=Daniel |year=2002 |language=German |title=Sprache und Politik : Sprachpolitik und Sprachnationalismus in der Republik Indien und dem sozialistischen Jugoslawien (1945\u20131991) |trans-title=Language and Policy: Language Policy and Linguistic Nationalism in the Republic of India and the Socialist Yugoslavia (1945\u20131991) |series=Beitr\u00e4ge zur S\u00fcdasienforschung ;

He recruited guitarists Mathias Dieth and Peter Szigeti, bassist Frank Rittel and drummer Thomas Franke. They released their debut album titled ''[[Animal House (U.D.O. album)|Animal House]]'' on 3 November 1987, which was entirely written by Accept. They would tour with the likes of [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Lita Ford]] and [[Zodiac Mindwarp]]. Rubach, Rittel and Franke departed the band, and guitarist Andy Susemihl, bassist Thomas Smuzyszki and drummer Stefan Schwarzmann joined. The follow-up album ''[[Mean Machine (U.D.O. album)|Mean Machine]]'' was released on 10 January 1989.\n\nSusemihl left the band, with U.D.O. now as a four-piece. The band shifted to a lighter approach with the third album ''[[Faceless World]]'', which was released on 25 February 1990, achieving great success; this being their best selling album so far. It was produced by former Accept drummer [[Stefan Kaufmann (musician)|Stefan Kaufmann]]. The fourth album ''[[Timebomb (album)|Timebomb]]'' was released on 3 April 1991. It was a more heavier album than their previous releases. In 1992, Dirkschneider put U.D.O. on hiatus to reunite with Accept.\n\n===1996\u2013present===\n[[File:U.D.O.-performing-live-at-Norway-Rock-Festival-2009.JPG|210px|thumb|left|U.D.O. performing live at [[Norway Rock Festival]] in 2009]]\nIn 1996, Dirkschneider reactivated U.D.O. with a brand new line-up; Stefan Kaufmann, now undertaking guitar duties, with guitarist J\u00fcrgen Graf and bassist Fitty Wienhold from Bullet, and Stefan Schwarzmann returning to the band. They took part in the 1997 compilation album ''[[A Tribute to Judas Priest: Legends of Metal]]'', in which they recorded the song \"Metal Gods\".\n\nOn 24 March 1997, U.D.O. released the fifth album ''[[Solid (U.D.O. album)|Solid]]''. It was featured on the [[Rock Hard (magazine)|Rock Hard]] magazine reader charts for more than a year after its release. The album was followed up with ''[[No Limits (U.D.O. album)|No Limits]]'' on 20 April 1998, featuring a similar songwriting approach from ''Solid''. The album features a cover of the Austrian pop band [[Supermax (band)|Supermax]]'s hit single \"Love Machine\". After the conclusion of the band's tour, Stefan Schwarzmann quit the band. New drummer Lorenzo Milani replaced him.\n\nThe seventh album ''[[Holy (U.D.O. album)|Holy]]'' was released on 18 October 1999, which received critical acclaim. It was a return to the guitar-driven sound similar to the ''[[Balls to the Wall]]''-era Accept. A world tour followed with dates in the United States and several other major countries. The band known as Vanize, fronted by Udo Dirkschneider's brother Peter, supported U.D.O. during the tour. Line-up changes occurred during the second part of the tour with [[Gotthard (band)|Gotthard]] guitarist Igor Gianola replacing J\u00fcrgen Graf. The tour spawned the first live album ''[[Live from Russia]]'', which was released on 15 October 2001, a 2-CD release featuring many of the classic Accept songs that have since become staples of U.D.O.'s set.\n\nOn 24 July 2002, the eighth album ''[[Man and Machine (U.D.O. album)|Man and Machine]]'' was released. It received a somewhat lukewarm reception. Despite standout songs such as the title track and \"Private Eye\", the album was ultimately less successful than ''Holy''. It is notable for the song \"Dancing with an Angel\", featuring a duet performance of Dirkschneider and vocalist [[Doro (musician)|Doro Pesch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/u-d-o-confirm-track-listing-for-man-and-machine/|title=U.D.O.

He recruited guitarists Mathias Dieth and Peter Szigeti, bassist Frank Rittel and drummer Thomas Franke. They released their debut album titled ''[[Animal House (U.D.O. album)|Animal House]]'' on 3 November 1987, which was entirely written by Accept. They would tour with the likes of [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Lita Ford]] and [[Zodiac Mindwarp]]. Rubach, Rittel and Franke departed the band, and guitarist Andy Susemihl, bassist Thomas Smuzyszki and drummer Stefan Schwarzmann joined. The follow-up album ''[[Mean Machine (U.D.O. album)|Mean Machine]]'' was released on 10 January 1989.\n\nSusemihl left the band, with U.D.O. now as a four-piece. The band shifted to a lighter approach with the third album ''[[Faceless World]]'', which was released on 25 February 1990, achieving great success; this being their best selling album so far. It was produced by former Accept drummer [[Stefan Kaufmann (musician)|Stefan Kaufmann]]. The fourth album ''[[Timebomb (album)|Timebomb]]'' was released on 3 April 1991. It was a more heavier album than their previous releases. In 1992, Dirkschneider put U.D.O. on hiatus to reunite with Accept.\n\n===1996\u2013present===\n[[File:U.D.O.-performing-live-at-Norway-Rock-Festival-2009.JPG|210px|thumb|left|U.D.O. performing live at [[Norway Rock Festival]] in 2009]]\nIn 1996, Dirkschneider reactivated U.D.O. with a brand new line-up; Stefan Kaufmann, now undertaking guitar duties, with guitarist J\u00fcrgen Graf and bassist Fitty Wienhold from Bullet, and Stefan Schwarzmann returning to the band. They took part in the 1997 compilation album ''[[A Tribute to Judas Priest: Legends of Metal]]'', in which they recorded the song \"Metal Gods\".\n\nOn 24 March 1997, U.D.O. released the fifth album ''[[Solid (U.D.O. album)|Solid]]''. It was featured on the [[Rock Hard (magazine)|Rock Hard]] magazine reader charts for more than a year after its release. The album was followed up with ''[[No Limits (U.D.O. album)|No Limits]]'' on 20 April 1998, featuring a similar songwriting approach from ''Solid''. The album features a cover of the Austrian pop band [[Supermax (band)|Supermax]]'s hit single \"Love Machine\". After the conclusion of the band's tour, Stefan Schwarzmann quit the band. New drummer Lorenzo Milani replaced him.\n\nThe seventh album ''[[Holy (U.D.O. album)|Holy]]'' was released on 18 October 1999, which received critical acclaim. It was a return to the guitar-driven sound similar to the ''[[Balls to the Wall]]''-era Accept. A world tour followed with dates in the United States and several other major countries. The band known as Vanize, fronted by Udo Dirkschneider's brother Peter, supported U.D.O. during the tour. Line-up changes occurred during the second part of the tour with [[Gotthard (band)|Gotthard]] guitarist Igor Gianola replacing J\u00fcrgen Graf. The tour spawned the first live album ''[[Live from Russia]]'', which was released on 15 October 2001, a 2-CD release featuring many of the classic Accept songs that have since become staples of U.D.O.'s set.\n\nOn 24 July 2002, the eighth album ''[[Man and Machine (U.D.O. album)|Man and Machine]]'' was released. It received a somewhat lukewarm reception. Despite standout songs such as the title track and \"Private Eye\", the album was ultimately less successful than ''Holy''. It is notable for the song \"Dancing with an Angel\", featuring a duet performance of Dirkschneider and vocalist [[Doro (musician)|Doro Pesch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/u-d-o-confirm-track-listing-for-man-and-machine/|title=U.D.O.

It ran from 22 January 1959 through 19 April 1961. Working in civilian clothing in conjunction with a French military mission, it concentrated on technical training of the [[Royal Lao Army]].\n\n==Background==\n\nIn March 1945, in the waning days of World War II, the Japanese occupiers of the [[Kingdom of Laos]] forced Lao independence from France. However, the French reasserted themselves in [[French Indochina]] after war's end. During the ensuing [[First Indochina War]], the [[Vietminh|Vietnamese Communist revolutionists]] invaded Laos in March 1953. After occupying large portions of [[Phongsaly]], [[Houaphanh Province]], and mountainous terrain that would become the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]], the Vietminh moved south to the [[Plain of Jars]] and in a column menacing [[Luang Prabang]]. The Plain of Jars offered the French forces the advantages of attacking the Viet Minh in the open with artillery and air strikes; that assault was halted. The column near Luang Prabang was also stopped when it was ambushed. A third Vietminh force captured [[Thakhek]] on 25 December 1953, cutting Laos in two. This force would not be evicted until February 1954.<ref>Anthony, Sexton, p. 8.</ref>\n\nAs France departed Laos after losing the First Indochina War, the United States moved in to support the [[Royal Lao Government]]. In the wake of the [[1954 Geneva Conference]] and its treaties, the U.S. embassy in [[Vientiane]] established the [[Programs Evaluation Office]] to oversee military aid to Laos. It was established on 13 December 1954. Purportedly staffed by civilians, its personnel were U.S. military retirees, veterans, and reservists. Because the PEO personnel were not serving on active military duty, they were not in violation of the terms of the Geneva treaty.<ref>Castle, pp. 7\u201317.</ref>\n\n==The Heintges Plan==\n\nIn September 1958, Brigadier General [[John A. Heintges]] left the U.S. Army. In November, he flew to Laos to evaluate the Programs Evaluation Office, with a mandate to take charge of it. Heintges concluded that the staff of the PEO was too small, and seemed intent only on delivering equipment. There was a suspicion that some military aid to Laos was diverted for French use in the [[Algerian War]].<ref name=conboy20>Conboy, Morrison, p. 20.</ref>\n\nReturning to Washington, DC, Heintges lobbied for a larger PEO. He pointed to the sad shape of the [[Royal Lao Army]] as proof of need of U.S. military materiel and training. He was granted an increase in staff. Also, on 22 January 1959, [[CINCPAC]] levied a requirement for 12 [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]] Mobile Training Teams of eight men each; they were slated to start six months temporary duty in Laos on 1 April.<ref name=conboy20/>  The operation was kept secret from the American public and, in fact, U.S. commandos that were sent to Laos were given written orders stating they were going to Vietnam.<ref>Annie Jacobsen, \"Surprise, Kill, Vanish: The Secret History of CIA Paramilitary Armies, Operators, and Assassins,\" (New York: Little, Brown and Company, 2019), p. 112</ref> A cover story was arranged; the U.S. mission was purportedly from the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey]].<ref name=guardia155/> U.S. commandos were disguised as [[civilian]]s and carried civilian identifications.<ref>Annie Jacobsen, \"Surprise, Kill, Vanish: The Secret History of CIA Paramilitary Armies, Operators, and Assassins,\" (New York: Little, Brown and Company, 2019), p. 113</ref> General [[Donald Blackburn]] was charged with command of the mission. He prepared his men by requiring tutoring in both French and Lao, and insisting that all hands read the nonfiction book ''[[Street Without Joy]]'', as well as the novel ''[[The Ugly American]]'', before departure.<ref name=guardia155>Guardia, pp. 155\u2013156.</ref><ref>Gillespie, p. 50.</ref>\n\nHowever, negotiations with the French government delayed things. It was finally decided that the French instructors in Laos under the Geneva treaty would continue to teach tactics, while the American trainers would teach technical subjects. On 24 July 1959, the Mobile Training Teams arrived in [[Vientiane]]. Augmented by a control team 11 strong, the force was dubbed Project Hotfoot (Operation Hotfoot for security purposes); it was also known by the official but little-used title of the Laos Training Advisory Group. They were to work for the PEO as a training arm, teaching Lao soldiers the use of the [[M1 Garand]], [[Browning Automatic Rifle]], [[M1 Carbine]], [[bazooka]], [[M18 recoilless rifle]], and both 60mm and 81mm [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]]. The Green Berets were commanded on site by Lieutenant Colonel [[Arthur D. Simons]].<ref>Conboy, Morrison, pp. 20\u201321.</ref>\n\n==Hotfoot at work==\n\nHaving been delayed in arrival, the Hotfoot contingent now found itself balked by Lao internal politics. While waiting for the local political situation to clear, the Hotfoot specialists hunkered in training centers at [[Luang Prabang]], [[Savannakhet]], [[Pakse]], and Vientiane. They surveyed the Royal Lao Army as they waited. By the time they were free to begin training at the beginning of September 1959, they had an excellent idea of the retraining task before them. Nine of the Mobile Training Teams were matched with French training teams at regional training camps. Three teams were assigned to build a new training facility northeast of Vientiane on Route 13 at Kilometer 22. This center would be an all-Hotfoot operation, with no French involved. Nearby, at Kilometer 17, they built a ranger training center.<ref>Conboy, Morrison, pp. 23\u201324.</ref>\n\nOn 25 November 1959, one of the Green Beret teams moved from Savannakhet into Military Region 2. They co-located at Khang Khay with a French training team and began building a clinic, rifle range, and demolitions practice area. As 1960 began, training of both regular and [[irregular military]] troops began. The latter were [[Auto Defense Choc]] guerrillas.<ref>Conboy, Morrison, p. 24.</ref>\n\nThe original Hotfoot contingent rotated out of Laos in February 1960, to be replaced by Hotfoot II. The new crew began ranger training for the RLA's ''1 Bataillon Parachutistes'' (1st Paratroop Battalion) and ''2 Bataillon Parachutistes'' (2d Paratroop Battalion). As Hotfoot II left Laos on 29 June 1960, to be replaced by Hotfoot III, 2nd BP began erecting a new battalion encampment for itself at KM 22. On 9 August, the 2nd BP commander, [[Kong Le]], would stage [[1960 Laotian coups#Kong Le's coup|his coup]] from there, commanding his loyal paratroopers.<ref>Conboy, Morrison, pp. 31\u201332.</ref>\n\n==Hotfoot becomes White Star==\n\nUnder incoming American President [[John F. Kennedy]], Hotfoot was rapidly expanded. Andrew Jackson Boyle had just been appointed as chief of the PEO; on 31 January 1961, just after the 19 January [[inauguration]], he requested nine more training teams. His rationale was that every existing or forming battalion in the Royal Lao Army should have an American advisor. The Pentagon signed off on the request, with three packets each consisting of three teams staggering their arrivals in Laos from March through May 1961. The Operation Hotfoot moniker changed to Operation Monkhood.<ref>Conboy, Morrison, p. 50.</ref>\n\nOn 19 April 1961, President Kennedy made a symbolic gesture in allowing the PEO to publicly become a MAAG; PEO members were allowed to don uniforms and resume usual public military courtesies. At the same time, the Hotfoot V teams were also renamed as [[Operation White Star]]. Operation Hotfoot had suffered five killed in action during its duties.<ref>Conboy, Morrison, p. 53.</ref><ref>Hall, pp. 331\u2013332.</ref> When Lieutenant Colonel Simons later organized the [[Operation Ivory Coast|Raid on Son Tay]], he would call upon men who served with him in Laos, such as [[Richard Meadows]] and [[Elliott P. Sydnor, Jr.]].<ref>Hall, pp. 411\u2013413.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n\n* Anthony, Victor B. and Richard R. Sexton (1993). ''The War in Northern Laos''.

It ran from 22 January 1959 through 19 April 1961. Working in civilian clothing in conjunction with a French military mission, it concentrated on technical training of the [[Royal Lao Army]].\n\n==Background==\n\nIn March 1945, in the waning days of World War II, the Japanese occupiers of the [[Kingdom of Laos]] forced Lao independence from France. However, the French reasserted themselves in [[French Indochina]] after war's end. During the ensuing [[First Indochina War]], the [[Vietminh|Vietnamese Communist revolutionists]] invaded Laos in March 1953. After occupying large portions of [[Phongsaly]], [[Houaphanh Province]], and mountainous terrain that would become the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]], the Vietminh moved south to the [[Plain of Jars]] and in a column menacing [[Luang Prabang]]. The Plain of Jars offered the French forces the advantages of attacking the Viet Minh in the open with artillery and air strikes; that assault was halted. The column near Luang Prabang was also stopped when it was ambushed. A third Vietminh force captured [[Thakhek]] on 25 December 1953, cutting Laos in two. This force would not be evicted until February 1954.<ref>Anthony, Sexton, p. 8.</ref>\n\nAs France departed Laos after losing the First Indochina War, the United States moved in to support the [[Royal Lao Government]]. In the wake of the [[1954 Geneva Conference]] and its treaties, the U.S. embassy in [[Vientiane]] established the [[Programs Evaluation Office]] to oversee military aid to Laos. It was established on 13 December 1954. Purportedly staffed by civilians, its personnel were U.S. military retirees, veterans, and reservists. Because the PEO personnel were not serving on active military duty, they were not in violation of the terms of the Geneva treaty.<ref>Castle, pp. 7\u201317.</ref>\n\n==The Heintges Plan==\n\nIn September 1958, Brigadier General [[John Heintges]] left the U.S. Army. In November, he flew to Laos to evaluate the Programs Evaluation Office, with a mandate to take charge of it. Heintges concluded that the staff of the PEO was too small, and seemed intent only on delivering equipment. There was a suspicion that some military aid to Laos was diverted for French use in the [[Algerian War]].<ref name=conboy20>Conboy, Morrison, p. 20.</ref>\n\nReturning to Washington, DC, Heintges lobbied for a larger PEO. He pointed to the sad shape of the [[Royal Lao Army]] as proof of need of U.S. military materiel and training. He was granted an increase in staff. Also, on 22 January 1959, [[CINCPAC]] levied a requirement for 12 [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]] Mobile Training Teams of eight men each; they were slated to start six months temporary duty in Laos on 1 April.<ref name=conboy20/>  The operation was kept secret from the American public and, in fact, U.S. commandos that were sent to Laos were given written orders stating they were going to Vietnam.<ref>Annie Jacobsen, \"Surprise, Kill, Vanish: The Secret History of CIA Paramilitary Armies, Operators, and Assassins,\" (New York: Little, Brown and Company, 2019), p. 112</ref> A cover story was arranged; the U.S. mission was purportedly from the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey]].<ref name=guardia155/> U.S. commandos were disguised as [[civilian]]s and carried civilian identifications.<ref>Annie Jacobsen, \"Surprise, Kill, Vanish: The Secret History of CIA Paramilitary Armies, Operators, and Assassins,\" (New York: Little, Brown and Company, 2019), p. 113</ref> General [[Donald Blackburn]] was charged with command of the mission. He prepared his men by requiring tutoring in both French and Lao, and insisting that all hands read the nonfiction book ''[[Street Without Joy]]'', as well as the novel ''[[The Ugly American]]'', before departure.<ref name=guardia155>Guardia, pp. 155\u2013156.</ref><ref>Gillespie, p. 50.</ref>\n\nHowever, negotiations with the French government delayed things. It was finally decided that the French instructors in Laos under the Geneva treaty would continue to teach tactics, while the American trainers would teach technical subjects. On 24 July 1959, the Mobile Training Teams arrived in [[Vientiane]]. Augmented by a control team 11 strong, the force was dubbed Project Hotfoot (Operation Hotfoot for security purposes); it was also known by the official but little-used title of the Laos Training Advisory Group. They were to work for the PEO as a training arm, teaching Lao soldiers the use of the [[M1 Garand]], [[Browning Automatic Rifle]], [[M1 Carbine]], [[bazooka]], [[M18 recoilless rifle]], and both 60mm and 81mm [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]]. The Green Berets were commanded on site by Lieutenant Colonel [[Arthur D. Simons]].<ref>Conboy, Morrison, pp. 20\u201321.</ref>\n\n==Hotfoot at work==\n\nHaving been delayed in arrival, the Hotfoot contingent now found itself balked by Lao internal politics. While waiting for the local political situation to clear, the Hotfoot specialists hunkered in training centers at [[Luang Prabang]], [[Savannakhet]], [[Pakse]], and Vientiane. They surveyed the Royal Lao Army as they waited. By the time they were free to begin training at the beginning of September 1959, they had an excellent idea of the retraining task before them. Nine of the Mobile Training Teams were matched with French training teams at regional training camps. Three teams were assigned to build a new training facility northeast of Vientiane on Route 13 at Kilometer 22. This center would be an all-Hotfoot operation, with no French involved. Nearby, at Kilometer 17, they built a ranger training center.<ref>Conboy, Morrison, pp. 23\u201324.</ref>\n\nOn 25 November 1959, one of the Green Beret teams moved from Savannakhet into Military Region 2. They co-located at Khang Khay with a French training team and began building a clinic, rifle range, and demolitions practice area. As 1960 began, training of both regular and [[irregular military]] troops began. The latter were [[Auto Defense Choc]] guerrillas.<ref>Conboy, Morrison, p. 24.</ref>\n\nThe original Hotfoot contingent rotated out of Laos in February 1960, to be replaced by Hotfoot II. The new crew began ranger training for the RLA's ''1 Bataillon Parachutistes'' (1st Paratroop Battalion) and ''2 Bataillon Parachutistes'' (2d Paratroop Battalion). As Hotfoot II left Laos on 29 June 1960, to be replaced by Hotfoot III, 2nd BP began erecting a new battalion encampment for itself at KM 22. On 9 August, the 2nd BP commander, [[Kong Le]], would stage [[1960 Laotian coups#Kong Le's coup|his coup]] from there, commanding his loyal paratroopers.<ref>Conboy, Morrison, pp. 31\u201332.</ref>\n\n==Hotfoot becomes White Star==\n\nUnder incoming American President [[John F. Kennedy]], Hotfoot was rapidly expanded. Andrew Jackson Boyle had just been appointed as chief of the PEO; on 31 January 1961, just after the 19 January [[inauguration]], he requested nine more training teams. His rationale was that every existing or forming battalion in the Royal Lao Army should have an American advisor. The Pentagon signed off on the request, with three packets each consisting of three teams staggering their arrivals in Laos from March through May 1961. The Operation Hotfoot moniker changed to Operation Monkhood.<ref>Conboy, Morrison, p. 50.</ref>\n\nOn 19 April 1961, President Kennedy made a symbolic gesture in allowing the PEO to publicly become a MAAG; PEO members were allowed to don uniforms and resume usual public military courtesies. At the same time, the Hotfoot V teams were also renamed as [[Operation White Star]]. Operation Hotfoot had suffered five killed in action during its duties.<ref>Conboy, Morrison, p. 53.</ref><ref>Hall, pp. 331\u2013332.</ref> When Lieutenant Colonel Simons later organized the [[Operation Ivory Coast|Raid on Son Tay]], he would call upon men who served with him in Laos, such as [[Richard Meadows]] and [[Elliott P. Sydnor, Jr.]].<ref>Hall, pp. 411\u2013413.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n\n* Anthony, Victor B. and Richard R. Sexton (1993). ''The War in Northern Laos''.
