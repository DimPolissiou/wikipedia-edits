Draper makes the argument that this division echoes the division between \"reformist or revolutionary, peaceful or violent, democratic or authoritarian, etc.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/> and identifies [[elitism]] as being one of the six major varieties of socialism from above, arguing: {{quote|We have mentioned several cases of this conviction that socialism is the business of a new ruling minority, non-capitalist in nature and therefore guaranteed pure, imposing its own domination either temporarily (for a mere historical era) or even permanently.

''Socialism: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-280431-6}}.</ref> This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress.<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/>\n\nThe first major fictional work that proposed an authoritarian socialist state was [[Edward Bellamy]]'s novel ''[[Looking Backward]]'' which depicted a [[bureaucratic]] [[Utopian socialism|socialist utopia]]. Bellamy distanced himself from radical socialist values and in many ways his ideal society still imitated many of the systems in late 19th century United States. However, his book served as the inspiration for a mass political movement called nationalism within the United States in the late 1800s. Those [[Nationalist Clubs]], so called because of their desire to nationalize [[industry]], were strong supporters of the [[People's Party (United States)|populists]], who wanted the [[nationalization]] of the railroad and telegraph systems. Despite their propaganda and involvement in politics, the nationalist movement began to decline in 1893 due to the financial difficulties of its main publications and Bellamy's failing health and essentially disappeared by the turn of the century.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn the society depicted in the novel, private property has been abolished in favor of state ownership, social classes were eliminated and all work which was minimal and relatively easy was done voluntarily by all citizens between the ages of 21 and 45. Workers were rewarded and recognized via a ranking system based on the army.<ref name=\"Bellamy\">{{cite book|last=Bellamy|first=Edward|title=Looking Backward: 2000-1887|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingbackward01bellgoog|date=1888|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}</ref> Most importantly, the government is the most powerful and respected institution, necessary for providing and maintaining this [[utopia]].<ref name=\"History\"/> Arthur Lipow identifies the bureaucratic ruling of this ideal society as a quasi-military organization of both economic and social relations.<ref name=\"Lipow\">{{cite book|last=Lipow|first=Arthur|title=Authoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement|date=1991|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520075436}}</ref> Bellamy elevated the modern military as a catalyst for national interest.<ref name=\"Bellamy\"/>\n\nThe biggest critique of Bellamy's society is that it is based on the idea of socialism from above. The regime is imposed on the people by an expert elite and there is no democratic control or individual liberty. Lipow argues that this inherently leads to [[authoritarianism]], writing: \"If the workers and the vast majority were a brutish mass, there could be no question of forming a political movement out of them nor of giving them the task of creating a socialist society. The new institutions would not be created and shaped from below but would, of necessity, correspond to the plan laid down in advance by the utopian planner\".<ref name=\"Lipow\"/>\n\n=== Austrian and Chicago schools of economics ===\n[[Friedrich Hayek]], an Austrian-born economist, was one of the leading academic critics of [[collectivism]] in the 20th century. He recognized and was acutely critical of the trends of socialism from above in collectivism, including theories that were based in voluntary cooperation.<ref name=\"Ebenstein\">{{cite book|last=Ebenstein|first=Alan|title=Friedrich Hayek: A Biography|year=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226181509}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Tebble|first1=Adam|last2=Meadowcroft|first2=John|title=F.A.

According to Hayek, it is in this way that it becomes possible for [[totalitarian]] leaders to rise to power as happened in the years following World War I.<ref name=\"Hayek\"/> [[Austrian School]] economists such as Hayek and his mentor [[Ludwig Mises]] also continually used the word ''socialism'' as a synonym for authoritarian socialism, central planning and state socialism, conflating it with fascism,<ref name=\"Mises\">Mises, Ludwig (1936) [1922].

When he visited Venezuela in May 1981, Hayek was asked to comment on the prevalence of totalitarian regimes in Latin America. In reply, Hayek warned against confusing \"totalitarianism with authoritarianism\" and said that he was unaware of \"any totalitarian governments in Latin America. The only one was Chile under Allende\". For Hayek, ''totalitarian'' signifies something very specific, namely the intention to \"organize the whole of society\" to attain a \"definite social goal\" which is stark in contrast to \"liberalism and individualism\".<ref name=\"Farrant, McPhail, Berger\"/>\n\nFriedman's involvement in the Chilean military dictatorship has also been criticized as he served as economic advisor.<ref>Letter from Arnold Harberger to Stig Ramel as reprinted in ''The Wall Street Journal'' on 12 October 1976.</ref><ref name=\"IcelandTV\">{{cite AV media|people=Friedman, Milton|date=31 August 1984|title=Iceland Television Debate|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJNxg3ZhXf8#t=9m11s&feature=PlayList&p=EBBF6DB20C85145A&playnext_from=PL&index=3|format=[[Flash video]]|medium=Television production|publisher=[[Television in Iceland|Icelandic State Television]]|location=[[Reykjav\u00edk]]|accessdate=27 June 2010|time=009:48:00|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423164050/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJNxg3ZhXf8#t=9m11s&feature=PlayList&p=EBBF6DB20C85145A&playnext_from=PL&index=3|archivedate=23 April 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>Friedman, Milton; Friedman, Rose D.

Other features that are common to modern authoritarian [[socialist states]] (starting in the 20th century) include an emphasis on [[heavy industry]] for [[Economic development|development]], a [[Single-party state|single-party system]] to propel the goals of the [[State (polity)|state]] forward, the extensive use of [[propaganda]] to do the same and more.<ref name=\"Huntington\"/><ref name=\"Lowy\"/><ref name=\"Amandae\"/>\n\nSoviet advocates and socialists responded to these criticisms by highlighting the ideological differences in the concept of [[Liberty#Politics|freedom]]. For instance, it was noted that \"[[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] norms disparaged ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[Liberal individualism|individualism]] (as when housing is determined by one's ability to pay)\" and condemned \"wide variations in personal wealth as the West has not\" whilst emphasizing equality, by which they meant \"free education and medical care, little disparity in housing or salaries, and so forth\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McFarland|first1=Sam|last2=Ageyev|first2=Vladimir|last3=Abalakina-Paap|first3=Marina|title=Authoritarianism in the former Soviet Union|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=63|issue=6|pages=1004\u20131010|date=1992|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.63.6.1004|citeseerx=10.1.1.397.4546}}</ref>\n\nWhen asked to comment on the claim that former citizens of socialist states now enjoy increased freedoms, [[Heinz Kessler]], former [[Ministry of National Defence (East Germany)|East German Minister of National Defence]], replied: \"Millions of people in Eastern Europe are now free from employment, free from safe streets, free from health care, free from social security\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Parenti|first=Michael|title=Blackshirts and Reds: Rational Fascism and the Overthrow of Communism|year=1997|publisher=City Lights Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0-87286-330-9|page=118}}</ref>\n\n=== Formation of industry ===\nAs authoritarian powers enforce socialist economics, the process often goes hand in hand with supporting the growth of heavy industry as a means of reaching [[industrialization]] (as can be seen with [[Joseph Stalin]]'s control of the [[Soviet Union]]).

''Economic Devolution in Eastern Europe''. New York: Praeger.

The one-year plans contained schedules and details that addressed current production and market equilibrium issues. The five-year plans integrated the political, military and economic strategy that would be pursued in the next five years as well as changes in capacity and production rates. It was done by a team of around the fifty leading experts from all the departments, ministries, professional and scientific organizations. The long-term plans encompassed a global strategy development. This plan was about goals for the state and society, not about individual responsibilities.

It has been argued that authoritarian socialist states failed because they did not create rules and operational criteria for the efficient operation of [[state enterprise]]s in their administrative, command allocation of [[resources]] and [[commodities]] and the lack of [[democracy]] in the political systems that the authoritarian socialist economies were combined with. A form of competitive socialism that rejects [[dictatorship]] and authoritarian allocation of resources in favor of [[economic democracy]] could work and prove superior to the [[market economy]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First|last1=Gregory|first1=Paul|last2=Stuart|first2=Robert|publisher=South-Western College Pub|year=2003|isbn=0-618-26181-8|page=152}}</ref> Others have argued that a central deficiency of such economic planning was that it was not premised on final consumer demand, but that such a system would be increasingly feasible with advances in information technology.<ref>Mandel, Ernest (September 1986).

The party makes all the decisions, but they should take into account the desires of the population and these desires were then to be weighted into the decision making. According to Article 11 of its [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]], the main goal of the [[Soviet Union]] was to \"raise the material and cultural standards of the working people\". Marxist thought and its interpretation by the Soviet Union dictated that private ownership was to be banned and the nationalization of all aspects of production a necessity, yet some things were not nationalized for the sake of economic efficiency or production targets. There was an emphasis on rapid industrialization, the development of heavy industry, relegation of consumer production as non-essential and collectivization of agriculture. [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]] also used a larger proportion of their resources on investment than do market economies. The issue with this was that current consumption was undercut because of the over-investment. All these actions supported the purposes of the state, not the people.<ref name=\"Ader\">Ader, Emile Bertrand (1970). ''Communism, Classic and Contemporary''. Woodbury: Barron's Educational Series.

This has been attributed to the [[Era of Stagnation]], a more tolerant central government and increasing military spending caused by the [[nuclear arms race]] with the United States, especially under [[Ronald Reagan]], whose administration pursued more aggressive relations with the Soviet Union instead of [[d\u00e9tente]] that was preferred in the 1970s. The end to the [[post-war consensus]] and [[Keynesianism]] in the 1970s and the rise of [[neoliberalism]] and [[economic globalization]] in the 1980s also caused problems as they forced the Soviet Union and other countries to adapt and reform themselves. Unlike China, the Soviet's failure to do so further contributed to its dissolution in December 1991. Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union to guarantee employment to all of its labor force, it did not satisfy the human desires of its laborers because \"people want land, not collectivization. Consumers want goods, not gigantic industrial enterprise. Workers want better wages and higher living standards, not citations and medals.

[[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] was set apart because the first stage of its transition consisted of economic recovery and then socialism was gradually implemented. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] differed from other Eastern European countries in that after 1950 it modified its economic system by making self-management the base of enterprise activity.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/> There were also a few differences between the economic model of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries such as East Germany and Poland.

Poland retained a centralized system similar to the Stalinist centralization of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Wellisz\"/> The Eastern European countries differed from the Soviet Union in that they had greater flexibility in the management of subordinate firms, the market was assigned a greater importance, accessible foreign trade and liberalization of the exchange of capital goods.

''Alternative Economic Models of Transition''. Aldershot; Burlington: Ashgate. ISBN 9780754636571.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], [[Mao Zedong]] condemned [[Stalinism]] and the flaws in the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] movement that peaked with the [[Hungarian Uprising of 1956]]. This gave Mao space in which to experiment with departure from the Soviet socialist economy. The Maoist economic model was reliant on ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' and ''Ten Great Relationships''. Mao modeled the Chinese socialist economy in such a way that it led to the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[People's commune|Commune Movement]]. In ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', Mao focused on the industrialization and mechanization of the countryside; in ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' wrote about his thoughts on the problems of socialist states as well as the conflicts of interest in the Chinese socialist society; and in ''Ten Great Relationships'' wrote about his vision of China's economy.<ref>Nove, Alec; Nuti, D. M. (1972). ''Socialist Economics''. Harmondsworth: Penguin. pp. 491\u2013510. ISBN 9780140806229.</ref>\n\nThe Maoist model had a dual economic goal, namely the industrialization of the countryside and the socialization of its people. It differed from the Soviet Union's goals in that Mao emphasized the [[class struggle]] against the [[bourgeoisie]] while the Soviet Union started advocating [[peaceful coexistence]]. China also allowed for more flexibility and experimentation than the Soviet Union and the countryside was at the center of its policies.<ref>Hoffmann, Charles (September 1971). \"The Maoist Economic Model\".

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n=== Economic challenges and legacy ===\nThe problem with the central planning of authoritarian socialist states is that as the state develops, it also grows in complexity and the possible errors grow and the possibilities of dis-allocations and waste of resources.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/> As commented by [[Karl Marx]], capitalism works because it is a system of economic force, but in socialist economics this force is insufficient to provide enough incentive. Human needs should be taken into account to make a socialist society function, but there is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital and human satisfaction.<ref>Ollman, Berell; Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel (1998).

ISBN 9780415919678.</ref> Some of the issues that emerged during the socialist phase of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and Maoist China included:\n* Inflation: Yugoslavia raised its industrial prices by 17% and its agricultural prices by 32% from 1964 to 1965 while Czechoslovakia raised the prices of foodstuffs and services by 20% in 1966 and by 1967 prices were up by 30%.\n* Lagged consumption: there was a lag between when products were fabricated and when they were accessed to by the population, goods tended to stockpile. The production of consumer products also diminished and in Yugoslavia the share of consumer products fell from 70% before World War II to 31% in 1965.\n* Fixing prices: prices were fixed under the premise that it would force producers to behave more efficiently and as such the price-controlled products were produced in lower quantities. In Yugoslavia, the market distortion caused by the price fixing was realized and led to the un-freezing of prices in 1967. Hungary also had frozen prices and slowly unfroze them over a period of ten to fifteen years because otherwise the structural disproportions of the Hungarian economy would spin prices out of control.\n* Production structure: many factories were kept running through government subsidies and protection despite any economic losses of the factories. This decreased overall efficiency of the socialist economies and also increased the financial losses of those economies.\n* Disproportionality: there was a disproportionate amount of available jobs and manpower. As argued by Ljubo Sirc, the \"Soviet Union and other communist countries have the worst of both worlds: some enterprises or operations are inefficient because they are too capital-intensive, other enterprises or operations because they are too labour-intensive\".<ref name=\"Sirc\"/>\n\nThe [[Stalinist]] economic model in which the socialist economies were based did not allow for a decrease in growth rates. It did not allow for the flexibility needed to keep up with growing economies.<ref name=\"Marangos\"/> Despite these shortcomings, the Soviet Union's growth in GDP per capita compared favorably with Western Europe.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> It has also been noted that such states compared favorably with Western states in some health indicators such as [[infant mortality]] and [[life expectancy]],<ref>Ellman, Michael (2014).

Presumably, the exploited classes believed that once the rapid and successful industrialization of Russia had taken place, power would be relinquished by the [[vanguard party]] and [[Communist society|communism]] would ensue.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> However, Stalin continued to demand even more far-reaching sacrifices. Because of his control over both political and economic arenas which historians argue gave his vanguard party an amount of control surpassing that of [[Russian tsar|Russia's tzars or emperors]], citizens were unwilling to challenge his decrees, given that aspects of their lives such as medical care, housing and social freedoms could be restricted according to the discretion of the party.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nDespite failures, Stalin's expectations remained uncontested by the working class and the model was adopted by a multitude of emerging socialist states during that era.

As the majority of excess deaths under Stalin were not direct killings, the exact number of victims of Stalinism is difficult to calculate due to lack of consensus among scholars on which deaths can be attributed to Stalin.<ref>Getty, J.

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n==== Maoism ====\n[[Maoism]] is an adapted Sino-centric version of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]].<ref name=\"Esh\">{{cite journal|last=Esherick|first=Joseph W.|title=On the \"Restoration of Capitalism\": Mao and Marxist Theory|journal=Modern China|date=January 1979|volume=5|issue=1|pages=41\u201377|doi=10.1177/009770047900500102}}</ref> While believing in [[democratic centralism]], where party decisions are brought about by scrutiny and debate and then are binding upon all members of the party once implemented, Mao did not accept dissenters to the party's decisions.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/> Through the [[Cultural Revolution]] and the [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries]], Mao attempted to purge any subversive idea\u2014especially capitalist or Western threat\u2014with heavy force, justifying his actions as the necessary way for the central authority to keep power.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/>\n\nAt the same time, Mao emphasized the importance of cultural heritage and individual choice as a way of creating this national unity. He described his ideal system as \"a political situation in which there is both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of purpose and personal ease of mind and liveliness to facilitate the socialist revolution\".<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/> While the system advocates contradiction, Mao believed the state above all could provide the masses with the tools for their own expression, but his own brand of self-expression was wholly manufactured, built largely on replacing [[Chinese culture|traditional practices and artifacts]] with his own. Through this, transformation of the people towards an internal party collectiveness was possible.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/>\n\nNotably, Mao's authoritarianism was rooted in a collective bottom-up style of empowerment. In his system, the proletariat and peasantry were responsible for rising up against the bureaucracy and capital of the state.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Joining the peasant class with the [[bourgeoisie]] of the countryside (the land-holding, local farmers), the group was able to stifle the claims to power by the wealthier, urban landowners through the banner of [[communism]]. Only when this collection of [[peasant]]s and [[petty bourgeoisie]] existed could Mao grow his own, custom bureaucracy.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Once this unity was established, Mao argued that the people were the ones who could control the state, but his government's intense control over the citizenry emphasizes the contradiction in his theory\u2014a contradiction, he maintained, was a necessary reality of their specialized system <ref name=\"Esh\"/>\n\n=== Arab world ===\n{{see also|Arab socialism}}\nSocialism was introduced into the Middle East in the form of [[Populism|populist]] policies designed to galvanize the [[working class]] into overthrowing [[colonial powers]] and their domestic allies. These policies were held by authoritarian states interested in the rapid industrialization and social equalization of Arab nations and often were characterized by redistributive or protectionist economic policies, lower class mobilization, charismatic leaders and promises to improve national living standards.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\">{{cite book|last=King|first=Stephen J.|year=2009|title=The New Authoritarianism in The Middle East and North Africa|location=Bloomington|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253221469}}</ref> Those states were progressive in terms of the colonial development that had occurred thus far. They allowed important political and economic gains to be made by workers, encouraged land redistribution, unseated oligarchical political powers and implemented [[Import substitution industrialization|import-substituting]] industrialization development strategies.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/>\n\nWith the collapse of the [[Eastern Bloc]] following the [[Revolutions of 1989]] and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991 as well as the push for [[democratization]], many Arab states have moved toward a model of fiscal discipline proposed by the [[Washington Consensus]].<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/> Although authoritarian leaders of those states implemented democratic institutions during the 1980s and 1990s, their multi-party elections created an arena in which business elites could lobby for personal interests while largely silencing the lower class.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/> Economic liberalization in these regions yielded economies that led to regimes built on the support of rent-seeking urban elites, with political opposition inviting the prospect of political marginalization and even retaliation.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/>\n\n==== Resistance to democratization ====\n[[File:WOSM-WAGGGS-Arab Region.svg|thumb|[[Arab world]]]]\nA great deal of debate has been paid by the field of comparative politics to how the Arab region was able to avoid the [[Third Wave Democracy|third wave of democratization]]. A number of arguments have been offered by professionals in the field, ranging from a discussion of [[Democratization|prerequisites]] not supported by the [[Arab culture]] to a lack of democratic actors initiating the necessary democratic transition.\n\nMarsha Pripstein Posusney argues that the \"patriarchal and tribal mentality of the culture is an impediment to the development of pluralist values\", rendering Arab citizens prone to accept patriarchal leaders and lacking the national unity that many argue is necessary for democratization to be successful.<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\">{{cite book|last=Posusney|first=Marsha Pripstein|title=Authoritarianism in the Middle East: Regimes and Resistance|date=2005|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|location=Boulder|isbn=978-1-58826-317-9}}</ref> Eva Bellin concedes that the prevalence of [[Islam]] is a distinguishing factor of the region and therefore must contribute to the region's exceptionalism, \"given Islam's presumed inhospitality to democracy\".<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\"/> Posusney argues that this \"intrinsic incompatibility between democracy and Islam\" remains unproven given that efforts to test this association quantitatively have failed to produce conclusive results.<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\"/> Ethnic divisions in the area have also been cited as a factor as well as a weak civil society, a state-controlled economy, poverty, low literacy rates and inequality.<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\"/><ref name=\"Debating\">{{cite book|last=Schlumberger|first=Oliver|title=Debating Arab Authoritarianism: Dynamics and Durability in Nondemocratic Regimes|date=2007|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford|isbn=978-0-8047-5776-8}}</ref>\n\nIn his book ''Debating Arab Authoritarianism: Dynamics and Durability in Nondemocratic Regimes'', Oliver Schlumberger has argued that there is in fact an international ambivalence toward authoritarianism in the Middle East given that stability is preferred over the uncertainty of democratization due to the region's oil and gas supplies and the strategic importance of its geopolitical location.<ref name=\"Debating\"/>\n\n=== Africa ===\n{{see also|African socialism}}\n[[File:L\u00e9opold Senghor, Pic, 5.jpg|thumb|150px|[[L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor]]]]\nDuring the [[Pan-African Congress|1945 Pan-African Conference]], calls for increased organization, development and self-determination in the poverty stricken African continent put the impetus on colonial powers to negotiate [[national sovereignty]].<ref name=\"Mushkat\">{{cite journal|last=Mushkat|first=Marion|title=African Socialism Reappraised and Reconsidered|journal=Istituto Italiano per l'Africa e l'Oriente|date=June 1972|volume=2|pages=151\u2013153}}</ref> While there were few Marxist movements into the continent, Soviet Union activity spurred anti-imperialist and globalization movements from African countries. The congress established [[African independence movements|national liberation]] as the main topic of their sessions, emphasizing the elimination and exploitation by the imperialist powers over authentic national sovereignty. However, they did not establish clear social or political parameters for this new liberation.<ref name=\"Mushkat\"/>\n\nAfrican leaders consistently viewed socialism as a direct rejection of the [[Colonisation of Africa|colonial system]] and in turn dismissed the notion of creating independent capitalist systems throughout the continent. They attempted to infuse various forms of socialism\u2014some Marxist\u2013Leninist, others democratic\u2014into tailored ideologies specific to each country.<ref name=\"Mushkat\"/> Once these systems were in place, countries developed towards a \"focal institutional\" society. According to sociologist William Friedland, societies adopted a totalitarian vision of rule, allowing one-party systems and institutions to \"penetrate every sphere of private or public activity\".<ref name=\"Gregor\">{{cite journal|last=Gregor|first=A.

His revision proved similar to that of [[Benito Mussolini]] as he called on a national movement from and for his one-party-ruled government, arguing: \"In a word, we must awaken the National Consciousness. [...] But the government cannot and must not do it all. It must be helped by the party. [...] Our party must be the consciousness of the masses\".<ref name=\"Gregor\"/>\n\n==== Ghana ====\nIn the same vein as Senghor, socialist leader [[Kwame Nkrumah]] sought to advance this one-party, nationalized form of socialist obedience. Nkrumah stressed the importance of government-owned property and resources. He maintained that \"production for private profit deprives a large section of the people of the goods and services produced\", advocating public ownership to fit the \"people's needs\".<ref name=\"Kwame\">{{cite book|last=Nkrumah|first=Kwame|title=Africa Must Unite|url=https://archive.org/details/africamustunite00nkru|url-access=registration|date=1963|publisher=Frederick A.

Those elites were only afforded one choice, namely to align with their government if they wanted access to the state. Gradually, those who were not granted or did not desire entrance into the party created regions blocs.<ref name=\"Redl\">{{cite book|last=Riedl|first=Rachel|year=2014|title=Authoritarian Origins of Democratic Party Systems in Africa|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=108|isbn=9781107045040}}</ref> The [[Ashanti people|Asante]] emerged as a regional force capable political sway.

In the system, all Tanzanains were encouraged to run for office, with no campaign funding allowed. Speeches in the election would not focus on the national issues, but rather on the quality of the individual, each of whom would be closely controlled by TANU.<ref name=\"Pratt\"/> Structurally, the power was shared along regional boundaries, giving increased policy making power and resource allocation to these regions.

Draper makes the argument that this division echoes the division between \"reformist or revolutionary, peaceful or violent, democratic or authoritarian, etc.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/> and identifies [[elitism]] as being one of the six major varieties of socialism from above, arguing: {{quote|We have mentioned several cases of this conviction that socialism is the business of a new ruling minority, non-capitalist in nature and therefore guaranteed pure, imposing its own domination either temporarily (for a mere historical era) or even permanently.

Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-280431-6}}.</ref> This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress.<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/>\n\nThe first major fictional work that proposed an authoritarian socialist state was [[Edward Bellamy]]'s novel ''[[Looking Backward]]'' which depicted a [[bureaucratic]] [[Utopian socialism|socialist utopia]]. Bellamy distanced himself from radical socialist values and in many ways his ideal society still imitated many of the systems in late 19th century United States. However, his book served as the inspiration for a mass political movement called nationalism within the United States in the late 1800s. Those [[Nationalist Clubs]], so called because of their desire to nationalize [[industry]], were strong supporters of the [[People's Party (United States)|populists]], who wanted the [[nationalization]] of the railroad and telegraph systems. Despite their propaganda and involvement in politics, the nationalist movement began to decline in 1893 due to the financial difficulties of its main publications and Bellamy's failing health and essentially disappeared by the turn of the century.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn the society depicted in the novel, private property has been abolished in favor of state ownership, social classes were eliminated and all work which was minimal and relatively easy was done voluntarily by all citizens between the ages of 21 and 45. Workers were rewarded and recognized via a ranking system based on the army.<ref name=\"Bellamy\">{{cite book|last=Bellamy|first=Edward|title=Looking Backward: 2000-1887|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingbackward01bellgoog|date=1888|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}</ref> Most importantly, the government is the most powerful and respected institution, necessary for providing and maintaining this [[utopia]].<ref name=\"History\"/> Arthur Lipow identifies the bureaucratic ruling of this ideal society as a quasi-military organization of both economic and social relations.<ref name=\"Lipow\">{{cite book|last=Lipow|first=Arthur|title=Authoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement|date=1991|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520075436}}</ref> Bellamy elevated the modern military as a catalyst for national interest.<ref name=\"Bellamy\"/>\n\nThe biggest critique of Bellamy's society is that it is based on the idea of socialism from above. The regime is imposed on the people by an expert elite and there is no democratic control or individual liberty. Lipow argues that this inherently leads to [[authoritarianism]], writing: \"If the workers and the vast majority were a brutish mass, there could be no question of forming a political movement out of them nor of giving them the task of creating a socialist society. The new institutions would not be created and shaped from below but would, of necessity, correspond to the plan laid down in advance by the utopian planner\".<ref name=\"Lipow\"/>\n\n=== Austrian and Chicago schools of economics ===\n[[Friedrich Hayek]], an Austrian-born economist, was one of the leading academic critics of [[collectivism]] in the 20th century.

When he visited Venezuela in May 1981, Hayek was asked to comment on the prevalence of totalitarian regimes in Latin America. In reply, Hayek warned against confusing \"totalitarianism with authoritarianism\" and said that he was unaware of \"any totalitarian governments in Latin America.

Other features that are common to modern authoritarian [[socialist states]] (starting in the 20th century) include an emphasis on [[heavy industry]] for [[Economic development|development]], a [[Single-party state|single-party system]] to propel the goals of the [[State (polity)|state]] forward, the extensive use of [[propaganda]] to do the same and more.<ref name=\"Huntington\"/><ref name=\"Lowy\"/><ref name=\"Amandae\"/>\n\nSoviet advocates and socialists responded to these criticisms by highlighting the ideological differences in the concept of [[Liberty#Politics|freedom]]. For instance, it was noted that \"[[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] norms disparaged ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[Liberal individualism|individualism]] (as when housing is determined by one's ability to pay)\" and condemned \"wide variations in personal wealth as the West has not\" whilst emphasizing equality, by which they meant \"free education and medical care, little disparity in housing or salaries, and so forth\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McFarland|first1=Sam|last2=Ageyev|first2=Vladimir|last3=Abalakina-Paap|first3=Marina|title=Authoritarianism in the former Soviet Union|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=63|issue=6|pages=1004\u20131010|date=1992|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.63.6.1004|citeseerx=10.1.1.397.4546}}</ref>\n\nWhen asked to comment on the claim that former citizens of socialist states now enjoy increased freedoms, [[Heinz Kessler]], former [[Ministry of National Defence (East Germany)|East German Minister of National Defence]], replied: \"Millions of people in Eastern Europe are now free from employment, free from safe streets, free from health care, free from social security\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Parenti|first=Michael|title=Blackshirts and Reds: Rational Fascism and the Overthrow of Communism|year=1997|publisher=City Lights Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0-87286-330-9|page=118}}</ref>\n\n=== Formation of industry ===\nAs authoritarian powers enforce socialist economics, the process often goes hand in hand with supporting the growth of heavy industry as a means of reaching [[industrialization]] (as can be seen with [[Joseph Stalin]]'s control of the [[Soviet Union]]).

The party's decisions are so integrated into public life that its economic and non-economic decisions are part of their overall actions.\n* State ownership of the means of production in which natural resources and capital belong to society.\n* Central economic planning, the main characteristic of an authoritarian, state socialist economy. The market is planned by a central government agency, generally a state planning commission.\n* Socially-equitable distribution of the national income in which goods and services are provided for free by the state that supplement private consumption.\n\nThis economic model is greatly characterized by the government's central planning.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\">Wilczynski, J.

The one-year plans contained schedules and details that addressed current production and market equilibrium issues. The five-year plans integrated the political, military and economic strategy that would be pursued in the next five years as well as changes in capacity and production rates. It was done by a team of around the fifty leading experts from all the departments, ministries, professional and scientific organizations. The long-term plans encompassed a global strategy development. This plan was about goals for the state and society, not about individual responsibilities.

It has been argued that authoritarian socialist states failed because they did not create rules and operational criteria for the efficient operation of [[state enterprise]]s in their administrative, command allocation of [[resources]] and [[commodities]] and the lack of [[democracy]] in the political systems that the authoritarian socialist economies were combined with.

The party makes all the decisions, but they should take into account the desires of the population and these desires were then to be weighted into the decision making. According to Article 11 of its [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]], the main goal of the [[Soviet Union]] was to \"raise the material and cultural standards of the working people\". Marxist thought and its interpretation by the Soviet Union dictated that private ownership was to be banned and the nationalization of all aspects of production a necessity, yet some things were not nationalized for the sake of economic efficiency or production targets. There was an emphasis on rapid industrialization, the development of heavy industry, relegation of consumer production as non-essential and collectivization of agriculture. [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]] also used a larger proportion of their resources on investment than do market economies. The issue with this was that current consumption was undercut because of the over-investment. All these actions supported the purposes of the state, not the people.<ref name=\"Ader\">Ader, Emile Bertrand (1970). ''Communism, Classic and Contemporary''. Woodbury: Barron's Educational Series. ISBN 9780812004038.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s\u20131970s, the [[economy of the Soviet Union]] grew at a rate that outpaced that of Western European nations, but by the 1980s the Soviet economy was in shambles. This has been attributed to the [[Era of Stagnation]], a more tolerant central government and increasing military spending caused by the [[nuclear arms race]] with the United States, especially under [[Ronald Reagan]], whose administration pursued more aggressive relations with the Soviet Union instead of [[d\u00e9tente]] that was preferred in the 1970s. The end to the [[post-war consensus]] and [[Keynesianism]] in the 1970s and the rise of [[neoliberalism]] and [[economic globalization]] in the 1980s also caused problems as they forced the Soviet Union and other countries to adapt and reform themselves. Unlike China, the Soviet's failure to do so further contributed to its dissolution in December 1991. Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union to guarantee employment to all of its labor force, it did not satisfy the human desires of its laborers because \"people want land, not collectivization. Consumers want goods, not gigantic industrial enterprise. Workers want better wages and higher living standards, not citations and medals.

[[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] was set apart because the first stage of its transition consisted of economic recovery and then socialism was gradually implemented. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] differed from other Eastern European countries in that after 1950 it modified its economic system by making self-management the base of enterprise activity.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/> There were also a few differences between the economic model of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries such as East Germany and Poland.

This gave Mao space in which to experiment with departure from the Soviet socialist economy. The Maoist economic model was reliant on ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' and ''Ten Great Relationships''. Mao modeled the Chinese socialist economy in such a way that it led to the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[People's commune|Commune Movement]]. In ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', Mao focused on the industrialization and mechanization of the countryside; in ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' wrote about his thoughts on the problems of socialist states as well as the conflicts of interest in the Chinese socialist society; and in ''Ten Great Relationships'' wrote about his vision of China's economy.<ref>Nove, Alec; Nuti, D. M. (1972). ''Socialist Economics''. Harmondsworth: Penguin. pp. 491\u2013510. ISBN 9780140806229.</ref>\n\nThe Maoist model had a dual economic goal, namely the industrialization of the countryside and the socialization of its people. It differed from the Soviet Union's goals in that Mao emphasized the [[class struggle]] against the [[bourgeoisie]] while the Soviet Union started advocating [[peaceful coexistence]]. China also allowed for more flexibility and experimentation than the Soviet Union and the countryside was at the center of its policies.<ref>Hoffmann, Charles (September 1971). \"The Maoist Economic Model\".

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n=== Economic challenges and legacy ===\nThe problem with the central planning of authoritarian socialist states is that as the state develops, it also grows in complexity and the possible errors grow and the possibilities of dis-allocations and waste of resources.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/> As commented by [[Karl Marx]], capitalism works because it is a system of economic force, but in socialist economics this force is insufficient to provide enough incentive. Human needs should be taken into account to make a socialist society function, but there is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital and human satisfaction.<ref>Ollman, Berell; Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel (1998). ''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists''. New York: Routledge. pp. 60\u201362. ISBN 9780415919678.</ref> Some of the issues that emerged during the socialist phase of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and Maoist China included:\n* Inflation: Yugoslavia raised its industrial prices by 17% and its agricultural prices by 32% from 1964 to 1965 while Czechoslovakia raised the prices of foodstuffs and services by 20% in 1966 and by 1967 prices were up by 30%.\n* Lagged consumption: there was a lag between when products were fabricated and when they were accessed to by the population, goods tended to stockpile. The production of consumer products also diminished and in Yugoslavia the share of consumer products fell from 70% before World War II to 31% in 1965.\n* Fixing prices: prices were fixed under the premise that it would force producers to behave more efficiently and as such the price-controlled products were produced in lower quantities. In Yugoslavia, the market distortion caused by the price fixing was realized and led to the un-freezing of prices in 1967. Hungary also had frozen prices and slowly unfroze them over a period of ten to fifteen years because otherwise the structural disproportions of the Hungarian economy would spin prices out of control.\n* Production structure: many factories were kept running through government subsidies and protection despite any economic losses of the factories. This decreased overall efficiency of the socialist economies and also increased the financial losses of those economies.\n* Disproportionality: there was a disproportionate amount of available jobs and manpower. As argued by Ljubo Sirc, the \"Soviet Union and other communist countries have the worst of both worlds: some enterprises or operations are inefficient because they are too capital-intensive, other enterprises or operations because they are too labour-intensive\".<ref name=\"Sirc\"/>\n\nThe [[Stalinist]] economic model in which the socialist economies were based did not allow for a decrease in growth rates. It did not allow for the flexibility needed to keep up with growing economies.<ref name=\"Marangos\"/> Despite these shortcomings, the Soviet Union's growth in GDP per capita compared favorably with Western Europe.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> It has also been noted that such states compared favorably with Western states in some health indicators such as [[infant mortality]] and [[life expectancy]],<ref>Ellman, Michael (2014).

Presumably, the exploited classes believed that once the rapid and successful industrialization of Russia had taken place, power would be relinquished by the [[vanguard party]] and [[Communist society|communism]] would ensue.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> However, Stalin continued to demand even more far-reaching sacrifices. Because of his control over both political and economic arenas which historians argue gave his vanguard party an amount of control surpassing that of [[Russian tsar|Russia's tzars or emperors]], citizens were unwilling to challenge his decrees, given that aspects of their lives such as medical care, housing and social freedoms could be restricted according to the discretion of the party.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nDespite failures, Stalin's expectations remained uncontested by the working class and the model was adopted by a multitude of emerging socialist states during that era. The Soviet attempt to [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivize agriculture]], transforming the Soviet Union from one of the world's largest exporters of grain to the world's largest importer of grain, was widely replicated despite its failure.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> Many historians claim that extermination was the fate of a wide variety of people during Stalin's regime such as political opponents, ideological rivals, suspect party members, accused military officers, kulaks, lower-class families, former members of the societal elites, ethnic groups, religious groups and the relatives and sympathizers of these offenders.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/><ref name=\"The Case\"/><ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> These deaths occurred as a result of collectivization, famine, terror campaigns, disease, war and mortality rates in the Gulag. As the majority of excess deaths under Stalin were not direct killings, the exact number of victims of Stalinism is difficult to calculate due to lack of consensus among scholars on which deaths can be attributed to Stalin.<ref>Getty, J.

He described his ideal system as \"a political situation in which there is both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of purpose and personal ease of mind and liveliness to facilitate the socialist revolution\".<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/> While the system advocates contradiction, Mao believed the state above all could provide the masses with the tools for their own expression, but his own brand of self-expression was wholly manufactured, built largely on replacing [[Chinese culture|traditional practices and artifacts]] with his own. Through this, transformation of the people towards an internal party collectiveness was possible.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/>\n\nNotably, Mao's authoritarianism was rooted in a collective bottom-up style of empowerment. In his system, the proletariat and peasantry were responsible for rising up against the bureaucracy and capital of the state.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Joining the peasant class with the [[bourgeoisie]] of the countryside (the land-holding, local farmers), the group was able to stifle the claims to power by the wealthier, urban landowners through the banner of [[communism]]. Only when this collection of [[peasant]]s and [[petty bourgeoisie]] existed could Mao grow his own, custom bureaucracy.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Once this unity was established, Mao argued that the people were the ones who could control the state, but his government's intense control over the citizenry emphasizes the contradiction in his theory\u2014a contradiction, he maintained, was a necessary reality of their specialized system <ref name=\"Esh\"/>\n\n=== Arab world ===\n{{see also|Arab socialism}}\nSocialism was introduced into the Middle East in the form of [[Populism|populist]] policies designed to galvanize the [[working class]] into overthrowing [[colonial powers]] and their domestic allies. These policies were held by authoritarian states interested in the rapid industrialization and social equalization of Arab nations and often were characterized by redistributive or protectionist economic policies, lower class mobilization, charismatic leaders and promises to improve national living standards.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\">{{cite book|last=King|first=Stephen J.|year=2009|title=The New Authoritarianism in The Middle East and North Africa|location=Bloomington|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253221469}}</ref> Those states were progressive in terms of the colonial development that had occurred thus far. They allowed important political and economic gains to be made by workers, encouraged land redistribution, unseated oligarchical political powers and implemented [[Import substitution industrialization|import-substituting]] industrialization development strategies.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/>\n\nWith the collapse of the [[Eastern Bloc]] following the [[Revolutions of 1989]] and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991 as well as the push for [[democratization]], many Arab states have moved toward a model of fiscal discipline proposed by the [[Washington Consensus]].<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/> Although authoritarian leaders of those states implemented democratic institutions during the 1980s and 1990s, their multi-party elections created an arena in which business elites could lobby for personal interests while largely silencing the lower class.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/> Economic liberalization in these regions yielded economies that led to regimes built on the support of rent-seeking urban elites, with political opposition inviting the prospect of political marginalization and even retaliation.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/>\n\n==== Resistance to democratization ====\n[[File:WOSM-WAGGGS-Arab Region.svg|thumb|[[Arab world]]]]\nA great deal of debate has been paid by the field of comparative politics to how the Arab region was able to avoid the [[Third Wave Democracy|third wave of democratization]]. A number of arguments have been offered by professionals in the field, ranging from a discussion of [[Democratization|prerequisites]] not supported by the [[Arab culture]] to a lack of democratic actors initiating the necessary democratic transition.\n\nMarsha Pripstein Posusney argues that the \"patriarchal and tribal mentality of the culture is an impediment to the development of pluralist values\", rendering Arab citizens prone to accept patriarchal leaders and lacking the national unity that many argue is necessary for democratization to be successful.<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\">{{cite book|last=Posusney|first=Marsha Pripstein|title=Authoritarianism in the Middle East: Regimes and Resistance|date=2005|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|location=Boulder|isbn=978-1-58826-317-9}}</ref> Eva Bellin concedes that the prevalence of [[Islam]] is a distinguishing factor of the region and therefore must contribute to the region's exceptionalism, \"given Islam's presumed inhospitality to democracy\".<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\"/> Posusney argues that this \"intrinsic incompatibility between democracy and Islam\" remains unproven given that efforts to test this association quantitatively have failed to produce conclusive results.<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\"/> Ethnic divisions in the area have also been cited as a factor as well as a weak civil society, a state-controlled economy, poverty, low literacy rates and inequality.<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\"/><ref name=\"Debating\">{{cite book|last=Schlumberger|first=Oliver|title=Debating Arab Authoritarianism: Dynamics and Durability in Nondemocratic Regimes|date=2007|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford|isbn=978-0-8047-5776-8}}</ref>\n\nIn his book ''Debating Arab Authoritarianism: Dynamics and Durability in Nondemocratic Regimes'', Oliver Schlumberger has argued that there is in fact an international ambivalence toward authoritarianism in the Middle East given that stability is preferred over the uncertainty of democratization due to the region's oil and gas supplies and the strategic importance of its geopolitical location.<ref name=\"Debating\"/>\n\n=== Africa ===\n{{see also|African socialism}}\n[[File:L\u00e9opold Senghor, Pic, 5.jpg|thumb|150px|[[L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor]]]]\nDuring the [[Pan-African Congress|1945 Pan-African Conference]], calls for increased organization, development and self-determination in the poverty stricken African continent put the impetus on colonial powers to negotiate [[national sovereignty]].<ref name=\"Mushkat\">{{cite journal|last=Mushkat|first=Marion|title=African Socialism Reappraised and Reconsidered|journal=Istituto Italiano per l'Africa e l'Oriente|date=June 1972|volume=2|pages=151\u2013153}}</ref> While there were few Marxist movements into the continent, Soviet Union activity spurred anti-imperialist and globalization movements from African countries.

However, they did not establish clear social or political parameters for this new liberation.<ref name=\"Mushkat\"/>\n\nAfrican leaders consistently viewed socialism as a direct rejection of the [[Colonisation of Africa|colonial system]] and in turn dismissed the notion of creating independent capitalist systems throughout the continent. They attempted to infuse various forms of socialism\u2014some Marxist\u2013Leninist, others democratic\u2014into tailored ideologies specific to each country.<ref name=\"Mushkat\"/> Once these systems were in place, countries developed towards a \"focal institutional\" society.

His revision proved similar to that of [[Benito Mussolini]] as he called on a national movement from and for his one-party-ruled government, arguing: \"In a word, we must awaken the National Consciousness. [...] But the government cannot and must not do it all. It must be helped by the party. [...] Our party must be the consciousness of the masses\".<ref name=\"Gregor\"/>\n\n==== Ghana ====\nIn the same vein as Senghor, socialist leader [[Kwame Nkrumah]] sought to advance this one-party, nationalized form of socialist obedience.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], [[Samuel Archer]], [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in chemistry and physics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in chemistry and physics. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and Liberia's [[Order of the Star of Africa]] (1955) for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for [[African Americans]] in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]], and remained a longstanding friend of Davis.<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Gloster 1981 78\">{{Harvnb|Gloster|1981|p=78.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson both played for Morehouse's [[American football|football team]], on which Davis was a [[defensive end]].<ref name=\"Wesley 1981 76\">{{Harvnb|Wesley|1981|p=76.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson befriended [[Charles H.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], [[Samuel Archer]], [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in chemistry and physics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in chemistry and physics. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and Liberia's [[Order of the Star of Africa]] (1955) for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for [[African Americans]] in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]], and remained a longstanding friend of Davis.<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Gloster 1981 78\">{{Harvnb|Gloster|1981|p=78.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson both played for Morehouse's [[American football|football team]], on which Davis was a [[defensive end]].<ref name=\"Wesley 1981 76\">{{Harvnb|Wesley|1981|p=76.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson befriended [[Charles H.

Before surgery, Darwish had signed a document asking not to be resuscitated in the event of brain death.<ref>[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2008/08/200889171240520492.html \"Palestinian poet Darwish dies\"], ''Al Jazeera'', 10 August 2008.</ref> According to [[Ibrahim Muhawi]], the poet, though suffering from serious heart problems, did not require urgent surgery, and the day set for the operation bore a symbolic resonance. In his ''Memory for Forgetfulness,'' Darwish centered the narrative of [[1982 Lebanon War|Israel's invasion of Lebanon]] and [[Siege of Beirut|88-day siege of Beirut]] on 6 August 1982, which was the anniversary of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bombing of Hiroshima]]. A new bomb had been deployed, which could collapse and level a 12-storey building by creating a vacuum. Darwish wrote: \"On this day, on the anniversary of the Hiroshima bomb, they are trying out the vacuum bomb on our flesh and the experiment is successful.\" By his choice of that day for surgery, Muwahi suggests, Darwish was documenting: \"the nothingness he saw lying ahead for the Palestinian people.\"<ref>[[Ibrahim Muhawi]], [http://ccas.georgetown.edu/document/1242772109538/CCAS_Occasional%2BPaper_7.pdf \"Contexts of Language in Mahmoud Darwish\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016235830/http://ccas.georgetown.edu/document/1242772109538/CCAS_Occasional%2BPaper_7.pdf |date=16 October 2014 }}, Center for Contemporary Arabic Studies, Georgetown University, 2009.</ref>\n\nEarly reports of his death in the Arabic press indicated that Darwish had asked in his will to be buried in Palestine.

A new bomb had been deployed, which could collapse and level a 12-storey building by creating a vacuum. Darwish wrote: \"On this day, on the anniversary of the Hiroshima bomb, they are trying out the vacuum bomb on our flesh and the experiment is successful.\" By his choice of that day for surgery, Muwahi suggests, Darwish was documenting: \"the nothingness he saw lying ahead for the Palestinian people.\"<ref>[[Ibrahim Muhawi]], [http://ccas.georgetown.edu/document/1242772109538/CCAS_Occasional%2BPaper_7.pdf \"Contexts of Language in Mahmoud Darwish\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016235830/http://ccas.georgetown.edu/document/1242772109538/CCAS_Occasional%2BPaper_7.pdf |date=16 October 2014 }}, Center for Contemporary Arabic Studies, Georgetown University, 2009.</ref>\n\nEarly reports of his death in the Arabic press indicated that Darwish had asked in his will to be buried in Palestine.

It is based on the book of the same name by [[Lois Lowry]]. \n\nThe film stars the voices of [[Will Forte]], [[Martin Short]], [[Alessia Cara]], [[Jane Krakowski]], [[Ricky Gervais]], [[Maya Rudolph]], [[Se\u00e1n Cullen]] and [[Terry Crews]]. The film was released on April 22, 2020 and received positive reviews from critics.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Plot|film|date=April 2020}}\nThe Willoughbys were once considered a proud family with amazing mustaches(even the women had facial hair). However, the current generation of the family is very dysfunctional as the parents are too busy being romantically involved with each other to take care of their four kids; the eldest sibling Tim, who lives in a coal bin and tries to keep his siblings out of trouble(while upholding the family legacy)the middle child Jane, a singing enthusiast who is constantly silenced by her parents, and the youngest twin boys who are both named Barnaby, both of whom are very smart and inventive but are labelled as 'creepy'. Their misfortunes are told from the perspective of a VERY FAT stray blue tabby cat who talks to the audience. \n\nSoon, the siblings find a baby inside a box that was thrown outside of their gate that they name Ruth. When the parents force their kids out of the house after discovering Ruth, they leave her on the doorstep of a candy factory and the factory director, Commander Melanoff, takes Ruth in. Wanting a better life, Jane tells her siblings they should send their parents on a 'vacation' by fabricating a brochure about travelling (when she hope for the parents to eventually die of some natural cause), though Tim has his reservations yet still goes along with it. The parents take the bait and proceed to leave the kids to their own devices. After a few days of celebrating their freedom, they are suddenly visited by a nanny the next day due to the parents having hired her to supervise the kids (albeit she came at a cheap price). At first, the kids try to get rid of her as well, but they soon warm up to her, except for Tim.\n\nAfter Tim misbehaves, the nanny tries to put him in time out, but soon learns of what happened to Ruth. She goes to Melanoff's factory to confront him and retrieve Ruth, and after chasing Ruth through some conveyor belts, the kids, Melanoff, and the nanny all get to know each other well. Meanwhile, the parents manage to survive the disasters (though their guides are not so fortunate) and when they get short on cash, they use the internet to sell their house in order to continue their vacation and inform the nanny to get rid of their kids. Tim learns of this and, believing the nanny is just as bad as their parents, calls Orphan Services to report her and he and his siblings get rid of all the potential buyers that soon line up to buy the house. They nearly fail to scare off a joyous family, but the nanny scares them off and finally convinces Tim that she means well. However, Orphan Services arrive at the house and try to take the kids. The head of the services recognizes the nanny, who she calls Linda, and reveals that she is an orphan herself who never found a family who wanted her.\n\nWhen it's revealed that Tim called them, Linda leaves in tears and Jane angrily denounces Tim as they are taken away and separated to individual homes, the Barnabys are taken in by a family with electronics, Jane's adopted by musical hippies, and Tim keeps running away from his foster homes and soon ends up at the Orphan Services center in a prison cell and the Willoughby mansion is destroyed. The cat stops a bus that Linda is on and has carried Tim's signature pith helmet to convince her to reunite them. She does so, with Tim apologizing to Jane and while on the run, Tim suggests that they get their parents back in order for Orphan Services to leave them alone, despite how much their kids hate them. Reluctantly agreeing to this, the kids' get help from Melanoff to construct a giant candy-fuelled dirigible to get to Switzerland,(which the kids called SVEETSEERLAND) where their parents are and planning to climb a giant dangerous mountain. \n\nThe kids take the dirigible without Linda and when they arrive at Switzerland, they find a trail of their Mom's yarn and soon discover their parents are about to freeze to death near the mountain's top. After saving them, the kids confess that they sent them away and Tim gives a passionate speech about how, despite how selfish the parents are, they are still family. Just as the parents look like they'll change for the better, they heartlessly shove their kids out of the way and take the dirigible, but their lack of driving expertise cause them to crash the dirigible in the mountain's top and flies out of control over the horizon, most likely killing them. Just as the kids soon resign themselves to being frozen with Jane singing through it, Ruth, Linda, and Melanoff save them and the kids tell them what happened to their parents. Linda and Melanoff decide to adopt the kids and they all move to the candy factory as a loving family.\n\nBefore the credits, it's shown that Mr. and Mrs. Willoughby have survived the dirigible crash and are, as always, enjoying each other's company while floating on the debris, but their luck finally ends when they are soon devoured by a shark.\n\nAfter the credits, it shows the cat licking and when he notices the audience, he tries to defend himself.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n* [[Will Forte]] as Tim Willoughby, the rational eldest child of the Willoughbys.\n* [[Alessia Cara]] as Jane Willoughby, the fun-loving middle-child of the Willoughbys with a passion for singing.\n* [[Se\u00e1n Cullen]] as Barnaby and Barnaby Willoughby, the creepy twin boys and youngest children of the Willoughbys.\n* [[Martin Short]] as Mr. Willoughby, the neglectful Willoughby patriarch.\n* [[Jane Krakowski]] as Mrs. Willoughby, the neglectful Willoughby matriarch.\n* [[Ricky Gervais]] as The Cat, a talking blue tabby cat and the narrator of this film.\n* [[Maya Rudolph]] as Linda, an eccentric babysitter who must look after the kids.\n* [[Terry Crews]] as Commander Melanoff, the joyous owner of a candy factory.\n\n== Production ==\nIn November 2015, [[Bron Studios]] acquired the animated film rights to the [[Lois Lowry]]'s book ''The Willoughbys'', and hired Kris Pearn to adapt into a screenplay with Adam Wood to direct the film, with Aaron L.

It is based on the book of the same name by [[Lois Lowry]]. \n\nThe film stars the voices of [[Will Forte]], [[Martin Short]], [[Alessia Cara]], [[Jane Krakowski]], [[Ricky Gervais]], [[Maya Rudolph]], [[Se\u00e1n Cullen]] and [[Terry Crews]]. The film was released on April 22, 2020 and received positive reviews from critics.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Plot|film|date=April 2020}}\nThe Willoughbys were once considered a proud family. However, the current generation of the family is very dysfunctional as the parents are too busy being romantically involved with each other to take care of their four kids; the eldest sibling Tim, who lives in a coal bin and tries to keep his siblings out of trouble, middle child Jane, a singing enthusiast who is constantly silenced by her parents, and the youngest twin boys who are both named Barnaby, both of whom are very smart and inventive but are labelled as 'creepy'. Their misfortunes are told from the perspective of a stray blue tabby cat who talks to the audience. \n\nSoon, the siblings find a baby inside a box that was thrown outside of their gate that they name Ruth. When the parents force their kids out of the house after discovering Ruth, they leave her on the doorstep of a candy factory and the factory director, Commander Melanoff, takes Ruth in. Wanting a better life, Jane tells her siblings they should send their parents on a 'vacation' by fabricating a brochure about travelling (when she hope for the parents to eventually die of some natural cause), though Tim has his reservations yet still goes along with it. The parents take the bait and proceed to leave the kids to their own devices. After a few days of celebrating their freedom, they are suddenly visited by a nanny the next day due to the parents having hired her to supervise the kids (albeit she came at a cheap price). At first, the kids try to get rid of her as well, but they soon warm up to her, except for Tim.\n\nAfter Tim misbehaves, the nanny tries to put him in time out, but soon learns of what happened to Ruth. She goes to Melanoff's factory to confront him and retrieve Ruth, and after chasing Ruth through some conveyor belts, the kids, Melanoff, and the nanny all get to know each other well. Meanwhile, the parents manage to survive the disasters (though their guides are not so fortunate) and when they get short on cash, they use the internet to sell their house in order to continue their vacation and inform the nanny to get rid of their kids. Tim learns of this and, believing the nanny is just as bad as their parents, calls Orphan Services to report her and he and his siblings get rid of all the potential buyers that soon line up to buy the house. They nearly fail to scare off a joyous family, but the nanny scares them off and finally convinces Tim that she means well. However, Orphan Services arrive at the house and try to take the kids. The head of the services recognizes the nanny, who she calls Linda, and reveals that she is an orphan herself who never found a family who wanted her.\n\nWhen it's revealed that Tim called them, Linda leaves in tears and Jane angrily denounces Tim as they are taken away and separated to individual homes, the Barnabys are taken in by a family with electronics, Jane's adopted by musical hippies, and Tim keeps running away from his foster homes and soon ends up at the Orphan Services center in a prison cell and the Willoughby mansion is destroyed. The cat stops a bus that Linda is on and has carried Tim's signature pith helmet to convince her to reunite them. She does so, with Tim apologizing to Jane and while on the run, Tim suggests that they get their parents back in order for Orphan Services to leave them alone, despite how much their kids hate them. Reluctantly agreeing to this, the kids' get help from Melanoff to construct a giant candy-fuelled dirigible to get to Switzerland, where their parents are and planning to climb a giant dangerous mountain. \n\nThe kids take the dirigible without Linda and when they arrive at Switzerland, they find a trail of their Mom's yarn and soon discover their parents are about to freeze to death near the mountain's top. After saving them, the kids confess that they sent them away and Tim gives a passionate speech about how, despite how selfish the parents are, they are still family. Just as the parents look like they'll change for the better, they heartlessly shove their kids out of the way and take the dirigible, but their lack of driving expertise cause them to crash the dirigible in the mountain's top and flies out of control over the horizon, most likely killing them. Just as the kids soon resign themselves to being frozen with Jane singing through it, Ruth, Linda, and Melanoff save them and the kids tell them what happened to their parents. Linda and Melanoff decide to adopt the kids and they all move to the candy factory as a loving family.\n\nBefore the credits, it's shown that Mr. and Mrs. Willoughby have survived the dirigible crash and are, as always, enjoying each other's company while floating on the debris, but their luck finally ends when they are soon devoured by a shark.\n\nAfter the credits, it shows the cat licking and when he notices the audience, he tries to defend himself.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n* [[Will Forte]] as Tim Willoughby, the rational eldest child of the Willoughbys.\n* [[Alessia Cara]] as Jane Willoughby, the fun-loving middle-child of the Willoughbys with a passion for singing.\n* [[Se\u00e1n Cullen]] as Barnaby and Barnaby Willoughby, the creepy twin boys and youngest children of the Willoughbys.\n* [[Martin Short]] as Mr. Willoughby, the neglectful Willoughby patriarch.\n* [[Jane Krakowski]] as Mrs. Willoughby, the neglectful Willoughby matriarch.\n* [[Ricky Gervais]] as The Cat, a talking blue tabby cat and the narrator of this film.\n* [[Maya Rudolph]] as Linda, an eccentric babysitter who must look after the kids.\n* [[Terry Crews]] as Commander Melanoff, the joyous owner of a candy factory.\n\n== Production ==\nIn November 2015, [[Bron Studios]] acquired the animated film rights to the [[Lois Lowry]]'s book ''The Willoughbys'', and hired Kris Pearn to adapt into a screenplay with Adam Wood to direct the film, with Aaron L.

The [[Red Army]] had launched its [[Silesian Offensives]] into pre-war German territory. The [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German army]] was retreating on all fronts, but still resisting strongly.

Alternatively, the report warned that the Germans might hold out until November if they could prevent the Soviets from taking [[Silesia]]. Hence any assistance to the Soviets on the Eastern Front could shorten the war.{{sfn|Davis|2006|p=491}}\n\nPlans for a large, intense aerial bombing of Berlin and the other eastern cities had been discussed under the code name [[Operation Thunderclap]] in mid-1944, but were shelved on 16 August.{{sfn|Taylor|2005|p=207}} These were now reexamined, and the decision was made to plan a more limited operation.{{sfn|Longmate|1983|p=332}}\n\nOn 22 January 1945, the RAF director of bomber operations, [[Air Commodore]] [[Sydney Bufton]], sent [[Deputy Chief of the Air Staff]] Air Marshal Sir [[Norman Bottomley]] a memorandum suggesting that what appeared to be a coordinated RAF air attack to aid the current Soviet offensive would have a detrimental effect on German morale.{{sfn|Addison|Crang|2006|p=21}} On 25 January, the Joint Intelligence Committee supported the idea, as it tied in with the [[Ultra]]-based intelligence that dozens of German [[Division (military)|divisions]] deployed in the west were moving to reinforce the Eastern Front, and that [[interdiction]] of these troop movements should be a \"high priority.\"{{sfn|Taylor|2005|p=209}} Air Chief Marshal Sir [[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet|Arthur Harris]], [[Air Officer Commanding|AOCinC]] [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]], nicknamed \"Bomber\" Harris in the British press, and known as an ardent supporter of [[area bombing]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/harris_sir_arthur_bomber.shtml |title=Sir Arthur 'Bomber' Harris (1892\u20131984) |work=Historic Figures |publisher=BBC |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116211800/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/harris_sir_arthur_bomber.shtml |archivedate=16 January 2008 }}</ref> was asked for his view, and proposed a simultaneous attack on [[Chemnitz]], [[Leipzig]] and Dresden.{{sfn|Longmate|1983|p=332}} That evening Churchill asked the [[Secretary of State for Air]], Sir [[Archibald Sinclair, 1st Viscount Thurso|Archibald Sinclair]], what plans had been drawn up to carry out these proposals. He passed on the request to Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir [[Charles Portal]], the [[Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Air Staff]], who answered, \"We should use available effort in one big attack on Berlin and attacks on Dresden, Leipzig, and Chemnitz, or any other cities where a severe blitz will not only cause confusion in the evacuation from the East, but will also hamper the movement of troops from the West.\"{{sfn|Longmate|1983|p=332}} He mentioned that aircraft diverted to such raids should not be taken away from the current primary tasks of [[Oil Campaign of World War II|destroying oil production facilities]], [[List of jet aircraft of World War II|jet aircraft]] factories, and [[Submarine pen|submarine yards]].{{sfn|Longmate|1983|p=332}}{{sfn|Taylor|2005|pp=209\u2013211}}\n\nChurchill was not satisfied with this answer and on 26 January pressed Sinclair for a plan of operations: \"I asked [last night] whether Berlin, and no doubt other large cities in east Germany, should not now be considered especially attractive targets ...

Attacks there, where main railway junctions, telephone systems, city administration and utilities were, would result in \"chaos.\" Ostensibly, Britain had learned this after the [[Coventry Blitz]], when loss of this crucial infrastructure had supposedly longer-lasting effects than attacks on war plants.{{sfn|Taylor|2005|p=215}}\n\nDuring the [[Yalta Conference]] on 4 February, the Deputy Chief of the Soviet General Staff, General [[Aleksei Antonov]], raised the issue of hampering the reinforcement of German troops from the western front by paralysing the junctions of Berlin and Leipzig with aerial bombardment.

The groups that followed the 303rd (92nd, 306th, 379th, 384th and 457th) also found Dresden obscured by clouds, and they too used H2X.

In the end, the only political action the German government took was to exploit it for propaganda purposes.{{sfn|Taylor|2005|pp=420\u20136}} Goebbels is reported to have wept with rage for twenty minutes after he heard the news of the catastrophe, before launching into a bitter attack on [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], the commander of the Luftwaffe: \"If I had the power I would drag this cowardly good-for-nothing, this Reich marshal, before a court. ...

Since no official estimate had been developed, the numbers were speculative, but newspapers such as the [[Stockholm]] ''Svenska Morgonbladet'' used phrases such as \"privately from Berlin,\" to explain where they had obtained the figures.{{sfn|Taylor|2005|p=423}} Frederick Taylor states that \"there is good reason to believe that later in March copies of\u2014or extracts from\u2014[an official police report] were leaked to the neutral press by Goebbels's Propaganda Ministry ... doctored with an extra zero to make [the total dead from the raid] 202,040\".{{sfn|Taylor|2004|p=370}} On 4 March, ''[[Das Reich (newspaper)|Das Reich]]'', a weekly newspaper founded by Goebbels, published a lengthy article emphasizing the suffering and destruction of a cultural icon, without mentioning any damage the attacks had caused to the German war effort.{{sfn|Taylor|2005|p=424}}<ref>Evans, Richard.

It was Stokes' questions in the House of Commons that were in large part responsible for the shift in the UK against this type of raid.

At a press briefing held by the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] two days after the raids, British Air Commodore [[Colin McKay Grierson]] told journalists:\n\n{{quote|First of all they (Dresden and similar towns) are the centres to which evacuees are being moved. They are centres of communications through which traffic is moving across to the Russian Front, and from the Western Front to the East, and they are sufficiently close to the Russian Front for the Russians to continue the successful prosecution of their battle. I think these three reasons probably cover the bombing.{{sfn|Taylor|2005|p=413}} }}\n\nOne of the journalists asked whether the principal aim of bombing Dresden would be to cause confusion among the refugees or to blast communications carrying military supplies. Grierson answered that the primary aim was to attack communications to prevent the Germans from moving military supplies, and to stop movement in all directions if possible. He then added in an offhand remark that the raid also helped destroy \"what is left of German morale.\" Howard Cowan, an Associated Press war correspondent, subsequently filed a story saying that the Allies had resorted to terror bombing. There were follow-up newspaper editorials on the issue and a longtime opponent of strategic bombing, Richard Stokes [[Member of Parliament|MP]], asked questions in the House of Commons on 6 March.{{sfn|Longmate|1983|p=344}}{{sfn|Taylor|2004|p=363}}\n\nChurchill subsequently re-evaluated the goals of the bombing campaigns, to focus less on widespread destruction, and more toward targets of tactical significance.{{sfn|Longmate|1983|p=345}}<ref name=\"Churchill HMSO\">\"The Strategic Air Offensive against Germany\" (SOA), HMSO (1961) vol 3 pp. 117\u20139.</ref>{{sfn|Taylor|2005|p=431}} On 28 March, in a memo sent by telegram to [[Hastings Lionel Ismay|General Ismay]] for the British Chiefs of Staff and the Chief of the Air Staff, he wrote:\n\n{{quote|It seems to me that the moment has come when the question of bombing of German cities simply for the sake of increasing the terror, though under other pretexts, should be reviewed.

The German national air-defence system could be used to argue\u2014as the tribunal did\u2014that no German city was \"undefended\".\n\nMarshall's tribunal declared that no extraordinary decision was made to single out Dresden (e.g. to take advantage of the large number of refugees, or purposely terrorize the German populace). It was argued that the intent of area bombing was to disrupt communications and destroy industrial production. The American inquiry established that the Soviets, pursuant to allied agreements for the United States and the United Kingdom to provide air support for the Soviet offensive toward Berlin, had requested area bombing of Dresden to prevent a counterattack through Dresden, or the use of Dresden as a regrouping point after a strategic retreat.<ref name=\"HABD_paragraph33-34\">[[#References|USAF]], II.

The first was on 2 March 1945, by 406 B-17s, which dropped 940 tons of high-explosive bombs and 141 tons of incendiaries. The second was on 17 April, when 580 B-17s dropped 1,554 tons of high-explosive bombs and 165 tons of incendiaries.<ref name=USAFHD/>\n\nAs far as Dresden being a militarily significant industrial centre, an official 1942 guide described the German city as \"...{{nbsp}}one of the foremost industrial locations of the Reich,\" and in 1944, the [[German Army High Command]]'s Weapons Office listed 127 medium-to-large factories and workshops that supplied materiel to the military.{{sfn|Taylor|2005|p=169}} Dresden was the seventh largest German city, and by far the largest un-bombed built-up area left, and thus was contributing to the defence of Germany itself.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|2005|p=3}} quoting an RAF Group briefing paper.</ref>\n\nAccording to the USAFHD, there were 110 factories and 50,000 workers supporting the German war effort in Dresden at the time of the raid.<ref name=USAFHD/> These factories manufactured fuses and bombsights (at Zeiss Ikon A.G.),{{sfn|Grant|2004}} aircraft components, [[88 mm gun|anti-aircraft guns]], [[field gun]]s, and [[small arms]], [[Chemical warfare|poison gas]], [[gear]]s and [[Differential (mechanical device)|differentials]], electrical and X-ray apparatus, electric gauges, [[gas mask]]s, [[Junkers (Aircraft)|Junkers]] aircraft engines, and [[Messerschmitt]] fighter cockpit parts.<ref name=USAFHD/>\n\nThe second of the five points addresses the prohibition in the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions]], of \"attack or bombardment\" of \"undefended\" towns. The USAFHD report states that Dresden was protected by anti-aircraft defences, antiaircraft guns, and searchlights, under the Combined Dresden (Corps Area IV) and Berlin (Corps Area III) Luftwaffe Administration Commands.<ref name=USAFHD/>\n\nThe third and fourth points say that the size of the Dresden raid\u2014in terms of numbers, types of bombs and the means of delivery\u2014were commensurate with the military objective and similar to other Allied bombings. On 23 February 1945, the Allies [[Bombing of Pforzheim in World War II|bombed Pforzheim]] and caused an estimated 20,000 civilian fatalities; the most devastating raid on any city was on [[Bombing of Tokyo (10 March 1945)|Tokyo on 9\u201310 March]] (the ''Meetinghouse'' raid)<ref>Crane, Conrad C. \"[https://www.pbs.org/thewar/detail_5229.htm The War: Firebombing (Germany & Japan)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602225435/http://www.pbs.org/thewar/detail_5229.htm |date=2 June 2017 }}.\" [[PBS]].

The tonnage and types of bombs listed in the service records of the Dresden raid were comparable to (or less than) [[Throw-weight|throw weights]] of bombs dropped in other air attacks carried out in 1945. In the case of Dresden, as in many other similar attacks, the hour break in between the RAF raids was a deliberate ploy to attack the fire fighters, medical teams, and military units.{{sfn|Taylor|2005|p=8}}\n\nIn late July 1943, the city of [[Hamburg]] was bombed in [[Operation Gomorrah]] by combined RAF and USAAF strategic bomber forces. Four major raids were carried out in the span of 10 days, of which the most notable, on 27\u201328 July, created a devastating [[firestorm]] effect similar to Dresden's, killing at least 45,000 people.{{sfn|Grayling|2006|p=20}} Two-thirds of the remaining population reportedly fled the city after the raids.<ref>[http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/hamburg.html Hamburg, 28 July 1943] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402052154/http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/hamburg.html |date=2 April 2009 }} RAF Bomber Command.

It was estimated that at least 23% of the city's industrial buildings were destroyed or severely damaged. The damage to other infrastructure and communications was immense, which would have severely limited the potential use of Dresden to stop the Soviet advance. The report concludes with: {{quote|The specific forces and means employed in the Dresden bombings were in keeping with the forces and means employed by the Allies in other aerial attacks on comparable targets in Germany.

For example, if a source says the Luftwaffe was short on fuel or aircraft, using that to conclude the raid was unnecessary would be synthesis, per WP:SYNT \u2013\nCountering the claim Dresden was a significant military target, Friedrich's earlier book, ''Der Brand: Deutschland im Bombenkrieg 1940\u20131945'' focuses on evidence showing German forces were in full retreat by February 1945. He argues the impact on civilians was out of all proportion to the military goal, reiterating the argument Allied forces were aware of the destruction caused by incendiary bombs. Friedrich also argues that the Allies had known that future attacks were likely to cause ever-increasing numbers of civilian deaths.<ref>Douglas Peifer [http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/GENOCIDE/reviewsw159.htm A review of ''Der Brand''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310082103/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/GENOCIDE/reviewsw159.htm |date=10 March 2005 }} Published in November 2003, by H-German, a member of [[H-Net]] Humanities & Social Sciences OnLine.</ref> He suggests that, by 1945, the German air defence had collapsed.

His studio having burned in the attack with his life's work, Rudolph immediately set out to record the destruction, systematically drawing block after block, often repeatedly to show the progress of clearing or chaos that ensued in the ruins. Although the city had been sealed off by the Wehrmacht to prevent looting, Rudolph was granted a special permit to enter and carry out his work, as he would be during the Russian occupation as well. By the end of 1945 he had completed almost 200 drawings, which he transferred to woodcuts following the war. He organized these as discrete series that he would always show as a whole, from the 52 woodcuts of ''Aus'' (Out, or Gone) in 1948, the 35 woodcuts ''Dresden 1945\u2013After the Catastrophe'' in 1949, and the 15 woodcuts and 5 lithographs of ''Dresden 1945'' in 1955. Of this work, Rudolph later described himself as gripped by an \"obsessive-compulsive state,\" under the preternatural spell of war, which revealed to him that \"the utterly fantastic is the reality. ...

The idea was that, as one building collapsed or filled with smoke, those using the basement as a shelter could knock the walls down and run into adjoining buildings.

Initially, some of the leadership, especially [[Robert Ley]] and [[Joseph Goebbels]], wanted to use it as a pretext for abandonment of the [[Geneva Conventions]] on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]]. In the end, the only political action the German government took was to exploit it for propaganda purposes.{{sfn|Taylor|2005|pp=420\u20136}} Goebbels is reported to have wept with rage for twenty minutes after he heard the news of the catastrophe, before launching into a bitter attack on [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], the commander of the Luftwaffe: \"If I had the power I would drag this cowardly good-for-nothing, this Reich marshal, before a court. ...

London, Sphere: 382\u20133</ref>\n\nOn 16 February, the [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Propaganda Ministry]] issued a press release that stated that Dresden had no war industries; it was a city of culture.{{sfn|Taylor|2005|pp=421\u2013422}}\n\nOn 25 February, a new leaflet with photographs of two burned children was released under the title \"Dresden\u2014Massacre of Refugees,\" stating that 200,000 had died. Since no official estimate had been developed, the numbers were speculative, but newspapers such as the [[Stockholm]] ''Svenska Morgonbladet'' used phrases such as \"privately from Berlin,\" to explain where they had obtained the figures.{{sfn|Taylor|2005|p=423}} Frederick Taylor states that \"there is good reason to believe that later in March copies of\u2014or extracts from\u2014[an official police report] were leaked to the neutral press by Goebbels's Propaganda Ministry ... doctored with an extra zero to make [the total dead from the raid] 202,040\".{{sfn|Taylor|2004|p=370}} On 4 March, ''[[Das Reich (newspaper)|Das Reich]]'', a weekly newspaper founded by Goebbels, published a lengthy article emphasizing the suffering and destruction of a cultural icon, without mentioning any damage the attacks had caused to the German war effort.{{sfn|Taylor|2005|p=424}}<ref>Evans, Richard. ''Telling Lies about Hitler: The Holocaust, History and the David Irving Trial'' p. 165.</ref>\n\nTaylor writes that this propaganda was effective, as it not only influenced attitudes in neutral countries at the time, but also reached the [[British House of Commons]] when [[Richard Stokes]], a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[Member of Parliament]] (MP), a long term opponent of area-bombing,<ref>Max Hastings (1980) ''Bomber Command'': 171\u20132</ref> quoted information from the German Press Agency (controlled by the Propaganda Ministry). It was Stokes' questions in the House of Commons that were in large part responsible for the shift in the UK against this type of raid.

At a press briefing held by the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] two days after the raids, British Air Commodore [[Colin McKay Grierson]] told journalists:\n\n{{quote|First of all they (Dresden and similar towns) are the centres to which evacuees are being moved. They are centres of communications through which traffic is moving across to the Russian Front, and from the Western Front to the East, and they are sufficiently close to the Russian Front for the Russians to continue the successful prosecution of their battle. I think these three reasons probably cover the bombing.{{sfn|Taylor|2005|p=413}} }}\n\nOne of the journalists asked whether the principal aim of bombing Dresden would be to cause confusion among the refugees or to blast communications carrying military supplies. Grierson answered that the primary aim was to attack communications to prevent the Germans from moving military supplies, and to stop movement in all directions if possible. He then added in an offhand remark that the raid also helped destroy \"what is left of German morale.\" Howard Cowan, an Associated Press war correspondent, subsequently filed a story saying that the Allies had resorted to terror bombing. There were follow-up newspaper editorials on the issue and a longtime opponent of strategic bombing, Richard Stokes [[Member of Parliament|MP]], asked questions in the House of Commons on 6 March.{{sfn|Longmate|1983|p=344}}{{sfn|Taylor|2004|p=363}}\n\nChurchill subsequently re-evaluated the goals of the bombing campaigns, to focus less on widespread destruction, and more toward targets of tactical significance.{{sfn|Longmate|1983|p=345}}<ref name=\"Churchill HMSO\">\"The Strategic Air Offensive against Germany\" (SOA), HMSO (1961) vol 3 pp. 117\u20139.</ref>{{sfn|Taylor|2005|p=431}} On 28 March, in a memo sent by telegram to [[Hastings Lionel Ismay|General Ismay]] for the British Chiefs of Staff and the Chief of the Air Staff, he wrote:\n\n{{quote|It seems to me that the moment has come when the question of bombing of German cities simply for the sake of increasing the terror, though under other pretexts, should be reviewed.

Marshall]], stated the raid was justified by the available intelligence. The inquiry declared the elimination of the German ability to reinforce a counter-attack against Marshal Konev's extended line or, alternatively, to retreat and regroup using Dresden as a base of operations, were important military objectives. As Dresden had been largely untouched during the war due to its location, it was one of the few remaining functional rail and communications centres. A secondary objective was to disrupt the industrial use of Dresden for munitions manufacture, which American intelligence believed was the case. The shock to military planners and to the Allied civilian populations of the German counterattack known as the [[Battle of the Bulge]] had ended speculation that the war was almost over, and may have contributed to the decision to continue with the aerial bombardment of German cities.{{sfn|Taylor|2004|p=196}}\n\nThe inquiry concluded that by the presence of active German military units nearby, and the presence of fighters and anti-aircraft within an effective range, Dresden qualified as \"defended\".<ref name=USAFHD/><!--Probably for compliance with the Draft Convention for the Protection of Civilian Populations Against New Engines of War.

It was argued that the intent of area bombing was to disrupt communications and destroy industrial production. The American inquiry established that the Soviets, pursuant to allied agreements for the United States and the United Kingdom to provide air support for the Soviet offensive toward Berlin, had requested area bombing of Dresden to prevent a counterattack through Dresden, or the use of Dresden as a regrouping point after a strategic retreat.<ref name=\"HABD_paragraph33-34\">[[#References|USAF]], II.

The first was on 2 March 1945, by 406 B-17s, which dropped 940 tons of high-explosive bombs and 141 tons of incendiaries. The second was on 17 April, when 580 B-17s dropped 1,554 tons of high-explosive bombs and 165 tons of incendiaries.<ref name=USAFHD/>\n\nAs far as Dresden being a militarily significant industrial centre, an official 1942 guide described the German city as \"...{{nbsp}}one of the foremost industrial locations of the Reich,\" and in 1944, the [[German Army High Command]]'s Weapons Office listed 127 medium-to-large factories and workshops that supplied materiel to the military.{{sfn|Taylor|2005|p=169}} Dresden was the seventh largest German city, and by far the largest un-bombed built-up area left, and thus was contributing to the defence of Germany itself.<ref>{{harvnb|Taylor|2005|p=3}} quoting an RAF Group briefing paper.</ref>\n\nAccording to the USAFHD, there were 110 factories and 50,000 workers supporting the German war effort in Dresden at the time of the raid.<ref name=USAFHD/> These factories manufactured fuses and bombsights (at Zeiss Ikon A.G.),{{sfn|Grant|2004}} aircraft components, [[88 mm gun|anti-aircraft guns]], [[field gun]]s, and [[small arms]], [[Chemical warfare|poison gas]], [[gear]]s and [[Differential (mechanical device)|differentials]], electrical and X-ray apparatus, electric gauges, [[gas mask]]s, [[Junkers (Aircraft)|Junkers]] aircraft engines, and [[Messerschmitt]] fighter cockpit parts.<ref name=USAFHD/>\n\nThe second of the five points addresses the prohibition in the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions]], of \"attack or bombardment\" of \"undefended\" towns. The USAFHD report states that Dresden was protected by anti-aircraft defences, antiaircraft guns, and searchlights, under the Combined Dresden (Corps Area IV) and Berlin (Corps Area III) Luftwaffe Administration Commands.<ref name=USAFHD/>\n\nThe third and fourth points say that the size of the Dresden raid\u2014in terms of numbers, types of bombs and the means of delivery\u2014were commensurate with the military objective and similar to other Allied bombings. On 23 February 1945, the Allies [[Bombing of Pforzheim in World War II|bombed Pforzheim]] and caused an estimated 20,000 civilian fatalities; the most devastating raid on any city was on [[Bombing of Tokyo (10 March 1945)|Tokyo on 9\u201310 March]] (the ''Meetinghouse'' raid)<ref>Crane, Conrad C. \"[https://www.pbs.org/thewar/detail_5229.htm The War: Firebombing (Germany & Japan)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602225435/http://www.pbs.org/thewar/detail_5229.htm |date=2 June 2017 }}.\" [[PBS]].

Four major raids were carried out in the span of 10 days, of which the most notable, on 27\u201328 July, created a devastating [[firestorm]] effect similar to Dresden's, killing at least 45,000 people.{{sfn|Grayling|2006|p=20}} Two-thirds of the remaining population reportedly fled the city after the raids.<ref>[http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/hamburg.html Hamburg, 28 July 1943] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402052154/http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/hamburg.html |date=2 April 2009 }} RAF Bomber Command.

It was estimated that at least 23% of the city's industrial buildings were destroyed or severely damaged. The damage to other infrastructure and communications was immense, which would have severely limited the potential use of Dresden to stop the Soviet advance. The report concludes with: {{quote|The specific forces and means employed in the Dresden bombings were in keeping with the forces and means employed by the Allies in other aerial attacks on comparable targets in Germany.

He argues the impact on civilians was out of all proportion to the military goal, reiterating the argument Allied forces were aware of the destruction caused by incendiary bombs.

Along with the romantic plot between a British bomber pilot and a German nurse, the movie attempts to reconstruct the facts surrounding the Dresden bombings from both the perspective of the RAF pilots and the Germans in Dresden at the time.<ref>{{IMDb title|0461658|Dresden|(2006) (TV)}}</ref>\n* The bombing is featured in the 1992 [[Vincent Ward (director)|Vincent Ward]] film, ''[[Map of the Human Heart]]'', with the hero, Avik, forced to bale out of his bomber and parachute down into the inferno.\n*The devastation of Dresden was recorded in the woodcuts of Wilhelm Rudolph, an artist born in the city who resided there until his death in 1982, and was 55 at the time of the bombing. His studio having burned in the attack with his life's work, Rudolph immediately set out to record the destruction, systematically drawing block after block, often repeatedly to show the progress of clearing or chaos that ensued in the ruins. Although the city had been sealed off by the Wehrmacht to prevent looting, Rudolph was granted a special permit to enter and carry out his work, as he would be during the Russian occupation as well. By the end of 1945 he had completed almost 200 drawings, which he transferred to woodcuts following the war. He organized these as discrete series that he would always show as a whole, from the 52 woodcuts of ''Aus'' (Out, or Gone) in 1948, the 35 woodcuts ''Dresden 1945\u2013After the Catastrophe'' in 1949, and the 15 woodcuts and 5 lithographs of ''Dresden 1945'' in 1955. Of this work, Rudolph later described himself as gripped by an \"obsessive-compulsive state,\" under the preternatural spell of war, which revealed to him that \"the utterly fantastic is the reality. ...

After being saved from going out of business in October 1923, the club changed their name to Dundee United in order to widen their appeal. Between 1925 and 1932 United were promoted and relegated between the first and second tier three times, winning the [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Second Division]] title in [[1924\u201325 Scottish Second Division|1925]] and [[1928\u201329 Scottish Second Division|1929]].<ref name=\"history2\">{{cite web | url=http://www.dundeeunitedfc.co.uk/index.asp?pg=439 | title=History \u2013 The Early Days | publisher=Dundee United FC | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329044059/http://www.dundeeunitedfc.co.uk/index.asp?pg=439 | archivedate=29 March 2012 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Promotion to the Top Flight (1959\u20131971) ===\nThe club took significant strides forward when [[Jerry Kerr]] became manager in 1959.

Although this \"classic\" version had been used as the club crest on the cover of the matchday programme as early as 1956, it had never appeared on the players' strip prior to 1983. Since 1959, various other designs had been worn on the shirts, incorporating either the lion rampant or the letters DUFC, often on a circular badge.\n\nThe club first introduced shirt sponsorship in the [[1985\u201386 in Scottish football|1985\u201386 season]] when future chairman [[Eddie Thompson]]'s [[VG (shop)|VG]] chain sponsored the club in the first of a two-year deal.

[[Telewest]] took over sponsorship from 1996 for six years until Eddie Thompson's [[Morning, Noon and Night (Convenience Store)|Morning, Noon and Night]] started sponsoring the club in 2002. This association continued until 2006 when [[Anglian Home Improvements]] began a two-year deal with an optional third year. At the same time, Ole International became the first shorts sponsors. [[JD Sports]]' [[Carbrini Sportswear]] brand sponsored the club in the 2008\u201309 and 2009\u201310 seasons. United's shirt sponsor from the 2016\u201317 season was [[McEwan Fraser Legal]], with Utilita taking over in 2018.\n\nUnited have had a number of official kit suppliers, including [[Adidas]], [[Hummel

After two seasons in the top tier, they were relegated, but they won the Division Two title for a second time in [[1928\u201329 in Scottish football|1928\u201329]]. Immediate relegation followed and the club finished runners-up in 1931\u201332.<ref name=\"history2\"/> Another runners-up spot was claimed in 1959\u201360, in manager [[Jerry Kerr]]'s first season, and from then club remained in the top division for the next 35-years.<ref name=\"kerr-history\"/> Under [[Jim McLean]]'s management, the club won the [[Scottish Football League Premier Division|Premier Division]] title for the only time, in [[1982\u201383 in Scottish football|1982\u201383]], resulting in [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] football the following season. The title win was United's last league success, although they finished runners-up in the [[Scottish First Division|First Division]] in [[1995\u201396 in Scottish football|1995\u201396]], after nearly avoiding relegation the previous season, and in third place in their first season back in the Premier Division.\n\n=== Cups ===\nThe club had to wait several decades before their first realistic chance at cup silverware, when they began the first of a six-game losing streak of [[Scottish Cup]] Final appearances in [[1973\u201374 Scottish Cup|1974]], losing 3\u20130 to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. Towards the end of the 1970s, things began to change, with three successive appearances in the [[Scottish League Cup|League Cup]] Final. United won their first major trophy with a 3\u20130 replay victory over [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] in the [[1979 Scottish League Cup Final (December)|1979\u201380 Scottish League Cup Final]].<ref name=\"league cup\"/> The club reached both cup finals in the [[1980\u201381 in Scottish football|following season]]; while they retained the League Cup by winning 3\u20130 against rivals [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]],<ref name=\"league cup\"/> United lost out again in the Scottish Cup with a replay defeat to [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. United reached a third consecutive League Cup Final in [[1981 Scottish League Cup Final|1981\u201382]], but failed to make it a hat-trick of wins as they lost 2\u20131 to Rangers.<ref name=\"league cup\">{{cite web |accessdate=29 September 2009| url=http://www.dundeeunitedfc.co.uk/index.asp?pg=292 | title=Dundee United A \u2013 Z ( L ) | publisher=Dundee United FC}}</ref>\n\n[[File:DUFCvKilmarnock.jpg|thumb|right|United (in red) versus [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]] at Tannadice in the [[2013\u201314 Scottish Cup]].]]\nUnited suffered the agony of reaching three out of four Scottish Cup finals in the mid-1980s, only to lose them all by a single goal. First came a 2\u20131 defeat to Celtic in [[1984\u201385 in Scottish football|1984\u201385]], compounded by a 1\u20130 League Cup final loss to Rangers in the same season; then a 1\u20130 defeat in extra time to [[St Mirren F.C.|St Mirren]] in [[1986\u201387 in Scottish football|1986\u201387]]; and finally, a last-minute 2\u20131 loss against Celtic the following year, despite being a goal ahead.<ref name=\"history4\" /> A three-year gap ensued before the [[1990\u201391 in Scottish football|1990\u201391]] Scottish Cup final, which pitted Jim McLean against his brother [[Tommy McLean|Tommy]], at [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]].

United then lost the [[2008 Scottish League Cup Final]] on penalties to Rangers after the match had finished 2\u20132 after extra time.

The Tangerines reached the League Cup final the following year, but lost to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in the [[2015 Scottish League Cup Final|final]].\n\nTwo years later, after the club's relegation from the [[2015\u201316 Scottish Premiership|Scottish Premiership]], they faced [[St Mirren F.C.|St. Mirren]] in the [[2017 Scottish Challenge Cup Final]]. United won the game 2\u20131, marking the club's first silverware since [[2009\u201310 Scottish Cup|2010]].\n\n=== Europe ===\n{{Main|Dundee United F.C. in European football}}\nThe club's first experience of Europe came in [[1966\u201367 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|1966\u201367 season]] when, helped by a clutch of Scandinavian players, United defeated [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] holders [[FC Barcelona]] both home and away. Although [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] proved too strong in the next round with a 3\u20131 aggregate victory, United made headlines and were asked to compete as [[Dallas Tornado]] in the [[United Soccer Association]] league in North America during the summer of 1967.<ref name=\"kerr-history\" />\n\nIn 1981\u201382 they began a period in which they were competitive in European competition. In a six-year spell they reached one UEFA final, another semi-final and two quarter finals. After their only Premier Division win in 1983, the team reached the resulting semi-final of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] in 1984, losing 3\u20132 on aggregate to [[A.S. Roma|Roma]]. In 1987, the club went one better, reaching the final of the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]. Despite the 2\u20131 aggregate loss to [[IFK G\u00f6teborg|IFK Gothenburg]], the club won the first-ever [[FIFA Fair Play Award]] for their supporters' sporting behavior after the final defeat.<ref name=\"uefa\" />\n\n== Rivalries ==\n[[File:Scottish Cup Final2 31.jpg|left|thumb|Dundee United faced rivals [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]] in the [[2014 Scottish Cup Final]]]]\n\nDundee United's traditional rivals are [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]], with whom they compete in the [[Dundee derby]]. The fixture was lacking a competitive element for a number of years until Dundee's return to the top flight of the Scottish game. A unique element of the rivalry lies in the fact that both clubs' stadiums are located within 100 yards of one another.\n\nIn spite of their rivalry, the two sides previously contemplated ground-sharing as part of the [[Scottish Football Association|SFA]]'s unsuccessful bid to host [[Euro 2008]]. Perhaps the most notable meeting was the final game of the [[1982-83 Scottish Premier Division|1982\u201383 Premier Division]] season, where if United were victors at Dens Park, they would clinch the top flight title; United were victorious thanks to an [[Eamonn Bannon]] winner.\n\nAnother intense fixture is that of the [[New Firm (Scotland)|New Firm]] derby between United and North-East rivals [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]]. The match itself became one of fierce competition due to the domestic and European success the two sides achieved in the late 1970s and 1980s under the stewardship of United's [[Jim McLean]] and Aberdeen's [[Alex Ferguson]].\n\nUnited also share a rivalry with [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]] due to the relatively close proximity of [[Dundee]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], known as the [[Tayside derby]].

These colours persisted in various forms up until 1969, sometimes using plain shirts, but also at various times including [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]-style broad hoops, [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]]-style narrow hoops and an [[Airdrie United F.C.|Airdrie]]-style \"V\" motif.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;margin-left:1em;float:right\"\n|-\n!Period\n!Kit manufacturer\n!Shirt sponsor\n|-\n|1973\u20131976\n|[[Bukta]]\n|rowspan=2|''none''\n|-\n|1976\u20131985\n|rowspan=3|[[Adidas]]\n|-\n|1985\u20131987\n|[[VG (shop)|VG]]\n|-\n|1987\u20131989\n|rowspan=4|[[Belhaven Brewery|Belhaven]]\n|-\n|1989\u20131991\n|[[ASICS]]\n|-\n|1991\u20131992\n|[[Bukta]]\n|-\n|1992\u20131993\n|rowspan=2|Loki\n|-\n|1993\u20131994\n|''none''\n|-\n|1994\u20131996\n|rowspan=2|[[Pony International|Pony]]\n|[[Rover Group|Rover]]\n|-\n|1996\u20131998\n|rowspan=3|[[Telewest]]\n|-\n|1998\u20132000\n|Olympic Sports\n|-\n|2000\u20132003\n|rowspan=2|TFG Sports\n|-\n|2003\u20132006\n|[[Morning, Noon and Night (Convenience Store)|Morning, Noon and Night]]\n|-\n|2006\u20132008\n|rowspan=2|[[Hummel International|Hummel]]\n|[[Anglian Home Improvements]]\n|-\n|2008\u20132009\n|rowspan=2|[[Carbrini Sportswear]]\n|-\n|2009\u20132010\n|rowspan=4|[[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]\n|-\n|2010\u20132016\n|[[Calor Gas|Calor]]\n|-\n|2016\u20132018\n|[[McEwan Fraser Legal]]\n|-\n|2018\u20132019\n|rowspan=2|Utilita\n|-\n|2019\u2013\n|[[Macron (sportswear)|Macron]] \n|}\n\nThe present club badge was introduced in 1993, and saw the previous [[lion rampant]] design rebranded in a new circular logo incorporating the club colours.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dundeeunitedfc.co.uk/index.asp?pg=220 | publisher=Dundee United FC | title=Dundee United A-Z (C) | accessdate=28 September 2006 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929211834/http://www.dundeeunitedfc.co.uk/index.asp?pg=220 | archivedate=29 September 2013 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> To mark the club's centenary in 2009, a special version of the badge with an added ''\"1909 2009 Centenary\"'' logo was introduced for the duration of the 2009\u201310 season, along with additional green trim on the badge, representing Dundee Hibernian's colours.\n\nPreviously, the lion had been represented on a simpler shield design. Although this \"classic\" version had been used as the club crest on the cover of the matchday programme as early as 1956, it had never appeared on the players' strip prior to 1983. Since 1959, various other designs had been worn on the shirts, incorporating either the lion rampant or the letters DUFC, often on a circular badge.\n\nThe club first introduced shirt sponsorship in the [[1985\u201386 in Scottish football|1985\u201386 season]] when future chairman [[Eddie Thompson]]'s [[VG (shop)|VG]] chain sponsored the club in the first of a two-year deal. A six-year association with [[Belhaven Brewery|Belhaven]] then ensued with a sponsorless [[1993\u201394 in Scottish football|1993\u201394 season]]. [[Rover Group|Rover]] began a two-year deal early in time for the 1994 [[Scottish Cup]] final, sponsoring the club until the end of the [[1995\u201396 in Scottish football|1995\u201396 season]]. [[Telewest]] took over sponsorship from 1996 for six years until Eddie Thompson's [[Morning, Noon and Night (Convenience Store)|Morning, Noon and Night]] started sponsoring the club in 2002. This association continued until 2006 when [[Anglian Home Improvements]] began a two-year deal with an optional third year. At the same time, Ole International became the first shorts sponsors. [[JD Sports]]' [[Carbrini Sportswear]] brand sponsored the club in the 2008\u201309 and 2009\u201310 seasons. United's shirt sponsor from the 2016\u201317 season was [[McEwan Fraser Legal]], with Utilita taking over in 2018.\n\nUnited have had a number of official kit suppliers, including [[Adidas]], [[Hummel

Sandwiched in the middle of these appearances was a defeat on penalties to [[Stenhousemuir F.C.|Stenhousemuir]] in the [[Scottish Challenge Cup]] (when United failed to concede a goal in the whole competition) and a 3\u20130 defeat to Celtic in the [[1997 Scottish League Cup Final]]. United then lost the [[2008 Scottish League Cup Final]] on penalties to Rangers after the match had finished 2\u20132 after extra time. Dundee United won their next major trophy in 2010, under the guidance of manager [[Peter Houston]], when [[Scottish First Division|First Division]] side [[Ross County F.C.|Ross County]] were defeated 3\u20130 in the [[2010 Scottish Cup Final]].<ref name = \"2010 final\">{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/8682861.stm |first=Thomas |last=McGuigan |work=BBC Sport |title=Dundee Utd 3 \u2013 0 Ross County |date=15 May 2010 |accessdate=25 April 2014}}</ref> [[David Goodwillie]] scored the first goal and Craig Conway scored the second and third goals.<ref name = \"2010 final\"/>\n\nUnited's 10th appearance in the Scottish Cup final came in [[2014 Scottish Cup Final|2014]], but the team lost 2\u20130 to [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]] at [[Celtic Park]]. The Tangerines reached the League Cup final the following year, but lost to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in the [[2015 Scottish League Cup Final|final]].\n\nTwo years later, after the club's relegation from the [[2015\u201316 Scottish Premiership|Scottish Premiership]], they faced [[St Mirren F.C.|St. Mirren]] in the [[2017 Scottish Challenge Cup Final]]. United won the game 2\u20131, marking the club's first silverware since [[2009\u201310 Scottish Cup|2010]].\n\n=== Europe ===\n{{Main|Dundee United F.C. in European football}}\nThe club's first experience of Europe came in [[1966\u201367 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|1966\u201367 season]] when, helped by a clutch of Scandinavian players, United defeated [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] holders [[FC Barcelona]] both home and away. Although [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] proved too strong in the next round with a 3\u20131 aggregate victory, United made headlines and were asked to compete as [[Dallas Tornado]] in the [[United Soccer Association]] league in North America during the summer of 1967.<ref name=\"kerr-history\" />\n\nIn 1981\u201382 they began a period in which they were competitive in European competition. In a six-year spell they reached one UEFA final, another semi-final and two quarter finals. After their only Premier Division win in 1983, the team reached the resulting semi-final of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] in 1984, losing 3\u20132 on aggregate to [[A.S. Roma|Roma]]. In 1987, the club went one better, reaching the final of the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]. Despite the 2\u20131 aggregate loss to [[IFK G\u00f6teborg|IFK Gothenburg]], the club won the first-ever [[FIFA Fair Play Award]] for their supporters' sporting behavior after the final defeat.<ref name=\"uefa\" />\n\n== Rivalries ==\n[[File:Scottish Cup Final2 31.jpg|left|thumb|Dundee United faced rivals [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]] in the [[2014 Scottish Cup Final]]]]\n\nDundee United's traditional rivals are [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]], with whom they compete in the [[Dundee derby]]. The fixture was lacking a competitive element for a number of years until Dundee's return to the top flight of the Scottish game. A unique element of the rivalry lies in the fact that both clubs' stadiums are located within 100 yards of one another.\n\nIn spite of their rivalry, the two sides previously contemplated ground-sharing as part of the [[Scottish Football Association|SFA]]'s unsuccessful bid to host [[Euro 2008]]. Perhaps the most notable meeting was the final game of the [[1982-83 Scottish Premier Division|1982\u201383 Premier Division]] season, where if United were victors at Dens Park, they would clinch the top flight title; United were victorious thanks to an [[Eamonn Bannon]] winner.\n\nAnother intense fixture is that of the [[New Firm (Scotland)|New Firm]] derby between United and North-East rivals [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]]. The match itself became one of fierce competition due to the domestic and European success the two sides achieved in the late 1970s and 1980s under the stewardship of United's [[Jim McLean]] and Aberdeen's [[Alex Ferguson]].\n\nUnited also share a rivalry with [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]] due to the relatively close proximity of [[Dundee]] and [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], known as the [[Tayside derby]]. The most notable meeting between the two sides was in the [[2014 Scottish Cup Final]], when St Johnstone won 2\u20130 at [[Celtic Park]] in United's tenth final appearance.\n\n== Honours ==\n\n=== League ===\n* '''[[List of Scottish football champions|Scottish league]], first tier:'''\n** '''Winners:''' [[1982\u201383 Scottish Premier Division|1982\u201383]]<ref name=\"scotprem-honours\" />\n* '''[[Scottish football league system|Scottish league]], second tier:'''\n**'''Winners:''' [[1924\u201325 in Scottish football|1924\u201325]], [[1928\u201329 in Scottish football|1928\u201329]], [[2019\u201320 Scottish Championship|2019\u201320]]\n\n=== Cups ===\n* '''[[Scottish Cup]]:'''\n** '''Winners''': [[1994 Scottish Cup Final|1993\u201394]], [[2010 Scottish Cup Final|2009\u201310]]<ref name=\"scotprem-honours\" />\n** Runners-up (8): [[1974 Scottish Cup Final|1973\u201374]], [[1981 Scottish Cup Final|1980\u201381]], [[1985 Scottish Cup Final|1984\u201385]], [[1987 Scottish Cup Final|1986\u201387]], [[1988 Scottish Cup Final|1987\u201388]], [[1991 Scottish Cup Final|1990\u201391]], [[2005 Scottish Cup Final|2004\u201305]], [[2014 Scottish Cup Final|2013\u201314]]\n* '''[[Scottish League Cup]]:'''\n** '''Winners:''' [[1979 Scottish League Cup Final (December)|1979\u201380]], [[1980 Scottish League Cup Final|1980\u201381]]<ref name=\"scotprem-honours\" />\n** Runners-up (5): [[1981 Scottish League Cup Final|1981\u201382]], [[1984 Scottish League Cup Final (October)|1984\u201385]], [[1997 Scottish League Cup Final|1997\u201398]], [[2008 Scottish League Cup Final|2007\u201308]], [[2015 Scottish League Cup Final|2014\u201315]]\n* '''[[Scottish Challenge Cup]]:'''\n** '''Winners:''' [[2017 Scottish Challenge Cup Final|2016\u201317]]\n** Runners-up: [[1995 Scottish Challenge Cup Final|1995\u201396]]\n* '''[[Summer Cup (Scottish football)|Summer Cup]]:'''\n** Runners-up: [[Summer Cup (Scottish football)|1964\u201365]]\n\n=== Europe ===\n* '''[[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]:'''\n** Runners-up: [[1987 UEFA Cup Final|1986\u201387]]<ref name=\"scotprem-honours\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scotprem.com/content/default.asp?page=s10_3|publisher=SPL|accessdate=29 September 2009|title=Dundee United Football Club Team Honours|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081116021209/http://www.scotprem.com/content/default.asp?page=s10_3|archive-date=16 November 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* '''[[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]:'''\n** Semi-finalists: [[1983\u201384 European Cup|1983\u201384]]\n\n=== Other ===\n* '''[[Forfarshire Cup]]:'''\n** '''Winners (21):''' [[1910\u201311 in Scottish football|1910\u201311]], [[1914\u201315 in Scottish football|1914\u201315]], [[1919\u201320 in Scottish football|1919\u201320]], [[1928\u201329 in Scottish football|1928\u201329]], [[1929\u201330 in Scottish football|1929\u201330]], [[1947\u201348 in Scottish football|1947\u201348]], [[1950\u201351 in Scottish football|1950\u201351]], [[1953\u201354 in Scottish football|1953\u201354]], [[1960\u201361 in Scottish football|1960\u201361]], [[1962\u201363 in Scottish football|1962\u201363]], [[1964\u201365 in Scottish football|1964\u201365]], [[1968\u201369 in Scottish football|1968\u201369]], [[1971\u201372 in Scottish football|1971\u201372]], [[1974\u201375 in Scottish football|1974\u201375]], [[1975\u201376 in Scottish football|1975\u201376]], [[1976\u201377 in Scottish football|1976\u201377]], [[1979\u201380 in Scottish football|1979\u201380]], [[1984\u201385 in Scottish football|1984\u201385]], [[1986\u201387 in Scottish football|1986\u201387]], [[1987\u201388 in Scottish football|1987\u201388]], [[2004\u201305 in Scottish football|2004\u201305]]\n**Runners-up (12)\n* '''[[Scottish War Emergency Cup]]:'''\n** Runners-up: [[Scottish War Emergency Cup|1940]]\n*'''[[Evening Telegraph Challenge Cup]]:'''\n**'''Winners:''' 2005\n**Runners-up: 2006\n\n===Youths===\n*'''[[SPFL Development League|SFL Youth League]]\n**'''Winners: 1996\u201397\n**Runners-up: 1997\u201398, 1999\u201300\n* '''[[Scottish Youth Cup]]\n**'''Winners: 1990, 1991,\n**Runners-up: 1989, 1998\n\n== Coaching staff ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

An alternative translation of this Hebrew word is derived from an Akkadian word \"nabu,\" meaning to call. The Hebrew \"navi\" has a passive sense and means \"the one who has been called\" (see HALOT, p.661).</ref> The second subdivision of the [[Tanakh]], ([[Nevi'im]]), is devoted to the Hebrew prophets. The meaning of ''navi'' is perhaps described in [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 18:18,<ref>{{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|18:18|105}}</ref> where [[God]] said, \"...and I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.\" Thus, the ''navi'' was thought to be the \"mouth\" of God. The root [[Nun (letter)|nun]]-[[Bet (letter)|bet]]-[[Aleph|alef]] (\"navi\") is based on the two-letter root nun-bet which denotes hollowness or openness; to receive transcendental wisdom, one must make oneself \"open\".<ref>[[Rashbam]]'s comment to [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 20:7.{{Bibleverse||Genesis|20:7|105}}</ref>\n\n==Abrahamic religions==\n\n=== Judaism ===\n{{See also|Nevi'im|Prophets in Judaism}}\n[[File:Duccio di Buoninsegna 066.jpg|thumb|[[Malachi]], one of the last prophets of Israel, painting by Duccio di Buoninsegna, c. 1310 (Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, [[Siena Cathedral]]).

Public revelation, in Catholicism, is part of the [[Deposit of faith]], the revelation of which was completed by Jesus; whereas private revelation does not add to the Deposit. The term \"deposit of faith\" refers to the entirety of Jesus Christ's revelation, and is passed to successive generations in two different forms, sacred scripture (the Bible) and sacred tradition.\n\nThe Bible terms anyone who claims to speak God's words or to teach in his name without being a prophet a [[false prophet]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} One [[Old Testament]] text  in [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]]<ref>{{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|18:21\u201322|9}}</ref> contains a warning against those who prophesy events which do not come to pass and says they should be put to death.

Other traditions place the number of prophets at 224,000. Some scholars hold that there are an even greater number in the history of mankind, and only God knows. The Quran says that God has sent a prophet to every group of people throughout time, and that Muhammad is the last of the prophets, sent for the whole of humankind.<ref>{{Cite quran|16|36|s=ns}}</ref> The message of all the prophets is believed to be the same. In Islam, all prophetic messengers are prophets (such as [[Adam]], [[Noah]], [[Abraham]], [[Moses]], [[Jesus]], and [[Muhammad]]) though not all prophets are prophetic messengers. The primary distinction is that a prophet is required to demonstrate God's law through his actions, character, and behavior without necessarily calling people to follow him, while a prophetic messenger is required to pronounce God's law (i.e. revelation) and call his people to submit and follow him. Muhammad is distinguished from the rest of the prophetic messengers and prophets in that he was commissioned by God to be the prophetic messenger to all of mankind. Many of these prophets are also found in the texts of Judaism (The Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings) and Christianity.<ref>(see [[Biblical narratives and the Quran]])</ref>\n\nMuslims often refer to Muhammad as \"the Prophet\", in the form of a noun.<ref>''Chambers 21st Century Dictionary''. p. 1111</ref><ref>Beyond the Written Word: Oral Aspects of Scripture in the History of Religion, William A.

Other main prophets are considered messengers or ''nab\u012b'', even if they didn't receive a Book from God. Examples include the messenger-prophet [[Aaron#Islam|Aaron| (''H\u0101r\u016bn'')]], the messenger-prophet [[Ishmael in Islam|Ishmael (''Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl'')]]) and the messenger-prophet [[Joseph in Islam|Joseph (''Y\u016bsuf'')]].\n\nAlthough it offers many incidents from the lives of many prophets, the Quran focuses with special narrative and rhetorical emphasis on the careers of the first four of these five major prophets. Of all the figures before Muhammad, the significance of Jesus in Islam is reflected in his being mentioned in the [[Quran]] in 93 [[Ayah|verses]] with various titles attached such as \"Son of [[Mary in Islam|Mary]]\" and other relational terms, mentioned directly and indirectly, over 187 times.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Jesus the Messiah in Muslim thought|last=Schumann, Olaf H.|date=2002|publisher=ISPCK/HMI|isbn=81-7214-522-5|location=Delhi|oclc=51207017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Jesus in the Qur'\u0101n|last=Parrinder, Geoffrey|isbn=978-1-85168-999-6|location=London|oclc=826659885}}</ref> He is thus [[List of people mentioned by name in the Quran#Prophets|the most mentioned person]] in the Quran by reference; 25 times by the name Isa, third-person 48 times, first-person 35 times, and the rest as titles and attributes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=&NA;|date=April 2005|title=SHOP TALK|journal=Oncology Times|volume=27|issue=8|pages=61\u201363|doi=10.1097/01.cot.0000289979.35060.79|issn=0276-2234}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Goodman|first=Alice|date=October 2005|title=Nutritional Concerns for Cancer Patients|journal=Oncology Times|volume=27|issue=19|pages=46\u201348|doi=10.1097/01.cot.0000289697.29855.46|issn=0276-2234}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Understanding Islam and Christianity|last=McDowell, Josh.|others=Walker, Jim, 1956-|isbn=978-0-7369-4991-0|location=Eugene, Oregon|oclc=859328502|date = October 2013}}</ref> Moses(''Musa'') and Abraham(''ibrahim'') are also referred to frequently in the Quran. As for the fifth, the [[Quran]] is frequently addressed directly to Muhammad, and it often discusses situations encountered by him. Direct use of his name in the text, however, is rare. Rarer still is the mention of Muhammad's contemporaries.\n\n== Prophetic claims in movements deriving from Abrahamic religions ==\nIn modern times the term \"prophet\" can be somewhat controversial. Many Christians with [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] or [[Charismatic Movement|charismatic beliefs]] believe in the continuation of the gift of prophecy and the continuation of the role of prophet as taught in [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 4.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Ephesians|4|9}}</ref> The content of prophecies can vary widely. Prophecies are often spoken as quotes from God. They may contain quotes from scripture, statements about the past or current situation, or predictions of the future. Prophecies can also 'make manifest the secrets' of the hearts of other people, telling about the details of their lives. Sometimes, more than one person in a congregation will receive the same message in prophecy, with one giving it before another.\n\nOther movements claim to have prophets. In France, Michel Potay says he received a revelation, called ''The Revelation of Ar\u00e8s'', dictated by Jesus in 1974, then by God in 1977. He is considered a prophet by his followers, the [[Pilgrims of Ar\u00e8s]].\n\n=== Bah\u00e1'\u00ed ===\n{{Main|Manifestation of God}}\n\nThe [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]] refers to what are commonly called prophets as \"Manifestations of God\" who are directly linked with the concept of [[Progressive revelation (Bah\u00e1'\u00ed)|Progressive revelation]]. Bah\u00e1'\u00eds believe that God expresses this will at all times and in many ways, including through a series of divine messengers referred to as \"Manifestations of God\" or \"divine educators\".<ref name=\"eor\">{{cite encyclopedia | last = Hutter | first = Manfred | editor = Ed.

Instead, the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed concept of the Manifestation of God emphasizes simultaneously the humanity of that intermediary and the divinity in the way they show forth the will, knowledge and attributes of God; thus they have both human and divine stations.<ref name=\"manifestation\" />\n\nIn addition to the Manifestations of God, there are also minor prophets. While the Manifestations of God, or major prophets, are compared to the Sun (which produces its own heat and light), minor prophets are compared to the Moon (which receives its light from the sun). Moses, for example, is taught as having been a Manifestation of God and his brother Aaron a minor prophet. Moses spoke on behalf of God, and Aaron spoke on behalf of Moses ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 4:14\u201317).<ref>{{Bibleverse||Exodus|4:14\u201317|9}}</ref> Other Jewish prophets are considered minor prophets, as they are considered to have come in the shadow of the dispensation of Moses to develop and consolidate the process he set in motion.\n\n===Catholicism ===\n\nA number of modern catholic saints have been claimed to have powers of prophecy, such as [[Padre Pio]] <ref>https://www.ewtn.com/padrepio/man/biography2.htm, retrieved June 10th 2016</ref> and [[Alexandrina Maria da Costa]].<ref>http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/ALEXDRIN.HTM, retrieved June 10th 2016</ref>\n\nIn addition to this many modern [[Marian apparition]]s included prophecies in them about the world and about the local areas.

In retrospect, his [[Great Peacemaker#Prophecy of the boy seer|prophecy of the boy seer]] could appear to refer to the conflict between natives and Europeans (white serpent).\n\nFrom 1805 until the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]] that falsified his predictions in 1811, the \"[[Shawnee]] prophet\" [[Tenskwatawa]] lead an Indian alliance to stop Europeans to take more and more land going west. He reported [[vision (spirituality)|vision]]s he had. He is said to have accurately predicted a [[solar eclipse]]. His brother [[Tecumseh]] re-established the alliance for [[Tecumseh's War]], that ended with the latter's death in 1813. Tecumseh fought together with British forces that, in the area of the [[Great Lakes]], occupied essentially today's territory of [[Canada]].\n\n[[Josiah Francis (Hillis Hadjo)|Francis the Prophet]], influenced by Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa, was a leader of the [[Red Stick]] faction of the [[Muscogee|Creek]] Indians. He traveled to England in 1815 as a representative of the \"four Indian nations\" in an unsuccessful attempt to get Great Britain to help them resist the expansionism of the white settlers.\n\n20 years later (1832), [[Wabokieshiek]], the \"[[Ho-Chunk|Winnebago]] Prophet\", after whom [[Prophetstown, Illinois|Prophetstown]] has been named, (also called \"White Cloud\") claimed that British forces would support the Indians in the [[Black Hawk War]] against the United States as 20 years earlier (based on \"visions\"). They did not, and no longer he was considered a \"prophet\".\n\nIn 1869, the [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] [[Wodziwob]] founded the [[Ghost Dance]] movement. The dance rituals were an occasion to announce his visions of an earthquake that would swallow the whites. He seems to have died in 1872.\n\nThe [[Northern Paiute]] [[Wovoka]] claimed he had a vision during the [[solar eclipse]] of January 1, 1889, that the Paiute dead would come back and the whites would vanish from America, provided the natives performed [[Ghost Dance]]s. This idea spread among other Native American peoples. The government were worried about a rebellion and sent troops, which lead to the death of [[Sitting Bull]] and to the [[Wounded Knee massacre]] in 1890.\n\n[[Clifford Trafzer]] compiled an anthology of essays on the topic, American Indian Prophets. {{cite book |last=Trafzer|first=Clifford |date= |title= American Indian Prophets: Religious Leaders and Revitalization Movements |url=https://archive.org/details/americanindianpr00traf|url-access=registration|location= |publisher=Sierra Oaks Publishing Co. |page= |isbn=9780940113022 |author-link= }}\n\n== Secular usage ==\nIn the late 20th century the appellation of ''prophet'' has been used to refer to individuals particularly successful at analysis in the field of economics, such as in the derogatory ''prophet of greed''.

An alternative translation of this Hebrew word is derived from an Akkadian word \"nabu,\" meaning to call. The Hebrew \"navi\" has a passive sense and means \"the one who has been called\" (see HALOT, p.661).</ref> The second subdivision of the [[Tanakh]], ([[Nevi'im]]), is devoted to the Hebrew prophets. The meaning of ''navi'' is perhaps described in [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 18:18,<ref>{{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|18:18|105}}</ref> where [[God]] said, \"...and I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.\" Thus, the ''navi'' was thought to be the \"mouth\" of God. The root [[Nun (letter)|nun]]-[[Bet (letter)|bet]]-[[Aleph|alef]] (\"navi\") is based on the two-letter root nun-bet which denotes hollowness or openness; to receive transcendental wisdom, one must make oneself \"open\".<ref>[[Rashbam]]'s comment to [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 20:7.{{Bibleverse||Genesis|20:7|105}}</ref>\n\n==Abrahamic religions==\n\n=== Judaism ===\n{{See also|Nevi'im|Prophets in Judaism}}\n[[File:Duccio di Buoninsegna 066.jpg|thumb|[[Malachi]], one of the last prophets of Israel, painting by Duccio di Buoninsegna, c. 1310 (Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, [[Siena Cathedral]]).

Allen (1971) comments that in the [[Solomon's Temple|First Temple]] Era, there were essentially seer-priests, who formed a guild, [[divination|divined]], performed rituals and sacrifices, and were scribes, and then there were canonical prophets, who did none of these (and were against divination) and had instead a message to deliver.<ref>Discussed more recently in Morris Silver, ''Prophets and Markets: The Political Economy of Ancient Israel'' (Dordrecht NL: Springer Science and Business Media, 2013), 154-75. \n{{ISBN|9789400974180}}</ref>  The seer-priests were usually attached to a local shrine or temple, such as [[Shiloh (biblical city)|Shiloh]], and initiated others as priests in that priesthood: it was a mystical craft-guild with apprentices and recruitment.

Other traditions place the number of prophets at 224,000. Some scholars hold that there are an even greater number in the history of mankind, and only God knows. The Quran says that God has sent a prophet to every group of people throughout time, and that Muhammad is the last of the prophets, sent for the whole of humankind.<ref>{{Cite quran|16|36|s=ns}}</ref> The message of all the prophets is believed to be the same. In Islam, all prophetic messengers are prophets (such as [[Adam]], [[Noah]], [[Abraham]], [[Moses]], [[Jesus]], and [[Muhammad]]) though not all prophets are prophetic messengers. The primary distinction is that a prophet is required to demonstrate God's law through his actions, character, and behavior without necessarily calling people to follow him, while a prophetic messenger is required to pronounce God's law (i.e. revelation) and call his people to submit and follow him. Muhammad is distinguished from the rest of the prophetic messengers and prophets in that he was commissioned by God to be the prophetic messenger to all of mankind. Many of these prophets are also found in the texts of Judaism (The Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings) and Christianity.<ref>(see [[Biblical narratives and the Quran]])</ref>\n\nMuslims often refer to Muhammad as \"the Prophet\", in the form of a noun.<ref>''Chambers 21st Century Dictionary''. p. 1111</ref><ref>Beyond the Written Word: Oral Aspects of Scripture in the History of Religion, William A.

Other main prophets are considered messengers or ''nab\u012b'', even if they didn't receive a Book from God. Examples include the messenger-prophet [[Aaron#Islam|Aaron| (''H\u0101r\u016bn'')]], the messenger-prophet [[Ishmael in Islam|Ishmael (''Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl'')]]) and the messenger-prophet [[Joseph in Islam|Joseph (''Y\u016bsuf'')]].\n\nAlthough it offers many incidents from the lives of many prophets, the Quran focuses with special narrative and rhetorical emphasis on the careers of the first four of these five major prophets. Of all the figures before Muhammad, the significance of Jesus in Islam is reflected in his being mentioned in the [[Quran]] in 93 [[Ayah|verses]] with various titles attached such as \"Son of [[Mary in Islam|Mary]]\" and other relational terms, mentioned directly and indirectly, over 187 times.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Jesus the Messiah in Muslim thought|last=Schumann, Olaf H.|date=2002|publisher=ISPCK/HMI|isbn=81-7214-522-5|location=Delhi|oclc=51207017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Jesus in the Qur'\u0101n|last=Parrinder, Geoffrey|isbn=978-1-85168-999-6|location=London|oclc=826659885}}</ref> He is thus [[List of people mentioned by name in the Quran#Prophets|the most mentioned person]] in the Quran by reference; 25 times by the name Isa, third-person 48 times, first-person 35 times, and the rest as titles and attributes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=&NA;|date=April 2005|title=SHOP TALK|journal=Oncology Times|volume=27|issue=8|pages=61\u201363|doi=10.1097/01.cot.0000289979.35060.79|issn=0276-2234}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Goodman|first=Alice|date=October 2005|title=Nutritional Concerns for Cancer Patients|journal=Oncology Times|volume=27|issue=19|pages=46\u201348|doi=10.1097/01.cot.0000289697.29855.46|issn=0276-2234}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Understanding Islam and Christianity|last=McDowell, Josh.|others=Walker, Jim, 1956-|isbn=978-0-7369-4991-0|location=Eugene, Oregon|oclc=859328502|date = October 2013}}</ref> Moses(''Musa'') and Abraham(''ibrahim'') are also referred to frequently in the Quran. As for the fifth, the [[Quran]] is frequently addressed directly to Muhammad, and it often discusses situations encountered by him. Direct use of his name in the text, however, is rare. Rarer still is the mention of Muhammad's contemporaries.\n\n== Prophetic claims in movements deriving from Abrahamic religions ==\nIn modern times the term \"prophet\" can be somewhat controversial. Many Christians with [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] or [[Charismatic Movement|charismatic beliefs]] believe in the continuation of the gift of prophecy and the continuation of the role of prophet as taught in [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 4.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Ephesians|4|9}}</ref> The content of prophecies can vary widely. Prophecies are often spoken as quotes from God. They may contain quotes from scripture, statements about the past or current situation, or predictions of the future. Prophecies can also 'make manifest the secrets' of the hearts of other people, telling about the details of their lives. Sometimes, more than one person in a congregation will receive the same message in prophecy, with one giving it before another.\n\nOther movements claim to have prophets. In France, Michel Potay says he received a revelation, called ''The Revelation of Ar\u00e8s'', dictated by Jesus in 1974, then by God in 1977. He is considered a prophet by his followers, the [[Pilgrims of Ar\u00e8s]].\n\n=== Bah\u00e1'\u00ed ===\n{{Main|Manifestation of God}}\n\nThe [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]] refers to what are commonly called prophets as \"Manifestations of God\" who are directly linked with the concept of [[Progressive revelation (Bah\u00e1'\u00ed)|Progressive revelation]]. Bah\u00e1'\u00eds believe that God expresses this will at all times and in many ways, including through a series of divine messengers referred to as \"Manifestations of God\" or \"divine educators\".<ref name=\"eor\">{{cite encyclopedia | last = Hutter | first = Manfred | editor = Ed.

Instead, the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed concept of the Manifestation of God emphasizes simultaneously the humanity of that intermediary and the divinity in the way they show forth the will, knowledge and attributes of God; thus they have both human and divine stations.<ref name=\"manifestation\" />\n\nIn addition to the Manifestations of God, there are also minor prophets. While the Manifestations of God, or major prophets, are compared to the Sun (which produces its own heat and light), minor prophets are compared to the Moon (which receives its light from the sun). Moses, for example, is taught as having been a Manifestation of God and his brother Aaron a minor prophet. Moses spoke on behalf of God, and Aaron spoke on behalf of Moses ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 4:14\u201317).<ref>{{Bibleverse||Exodus|4:14\u201317|9}}</ref> Other Jewish prophets are considered minor prophets, as they are considered to have come in the shadow of the dispensation of Moses to develop and consolidate the process he set in motion.\n\n===Catholicism ===\n\nA number of modern catholic saints have been claimed to have powers of prophecy, such as [[Padre Pio]] <ref>https://www.ewtn.com/padrepio/man/biography2.htm, retrieved June 10th 2016</ref> and [[Alexandrina Maria da Costa]].<ref>http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/ALEXDRIN.HTM, retrieved June 10th 2016</ref>\n\nIn addition to this many modern [[Marian apparition]]s included prophecies in them about the world and about the local areas.

As a result, ''The Watchtower'' has acknowledged that Jehovah's Witnesses \"have made mistakes in their understanding of what would occur at the end of certain time periods.\"<ref>''Reasoning From the Scriptures'' p.136</ref> Concurrently with these exceptions, Jehovah's Witnesses in their literature and assemblies have taught their leadership was personally chosen by Jesus Christ in 1919 (a prophetic year in Jehovah's Witnesses eschatology) and that they are \"God's sole channel on earth,\" and \"Jehovah's spirit directed organization\".\n\n=== Founders of Christian sects or movements ===\n\n==== Latter Day Saint movement ====\n[[File:Joseph Smith, Jr. portrait owned by Joseph Smith III.jpg|thumb|A portrait of [[Joseph Smith]]]]\n\n{{Main|Prophet, seer, and revelator|President of the Church|Revelation (Latter Day Saints)}}\n\n[[Joseph Smith]], who established the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]] in 1830, is considered a prophet by members of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], of which [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) is the largest denomination.

He traveled to England in 1815 as a representative of the \"four Indian nations\" in an unsuccessful attempt to get Great Britain to help them resist the expansionism of the white settlers.\n\n20 years later (1832), [[Wabokieshiek]], the \"[[Ho-Chunk|Winnebago]] Prophet\", after whom [[Prophetstown, Illinois|Prophetstown]] has been named, (also called \"White Cloud\") claimed that British forces would support the Indians in the [[Black Hawk War]] against the United States as 20 years earlier (based on \"visions\"). They did not, and no longer he was considered a \"prophet\".\n\nIn 1869, the [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] [[Wodziwob]] founded the [[Ghost Dance]] movement. The dance rituals were an occasion to announce his visions of an earthquake that would swallow the whites. He seems to have died in 1872.\n\nThe [[Northern Paiute]] [[Wovoka]] claimed he had a vision during the [[solar eclipse]] of January 1, 1889, that the Paiute dead would come back and the whites would vanish from America, provided the natives performed [[Ghost Dance]]s. This idea spread among other Native American peoples. The government were worried about a rebellion and sent troops, which lead to the death of [[Sitting Bull]] and to the [[Wounded Knee massacre]] in 1890.\n\n[[Clifford Trafzer]] compiled an anthology of essays on the topic, American Indian Prophets. {{cite book |last=Trafzer|first=Clifford |date= |title= American Indian Prophets: Religious Leaders and Revitalization Movements |url=https://archive.org/details/americanindianpr00traf|url-access=registration|location= |publisher=Sierra Oaks Publishing Co. |page= |isbn=9780940113022 |author-link= }}\n\n== Secular usage ==\nIn the late 20th century the appellation of ''prophet'' has been used to refer to individuals particularly successful at analysis in the field of economics, such as in the derogatory ''prophet of greed''.
