Selvam ([[Dhanush]]) is his son. Rajalingam ([[Prakash Raj]]) is the local MLA backed by Veerapandi. However, Rajalingam is in reality a corrupt politician, despite appearing good. One day, Veerapandi sends Selvam to [[Tiruchirappalli|Trichy]] to stay with his uncle Mariyappan ([[J. Livingston]]) ostensibly to tame rowdy behavior, but in truth to protect him. Selvam meets his childhood love interest Radhika ([[Tamannaah]]) who goes to college there. He proposes to her, but she tells him that she needs time to think about it. Selvam says he won't bother her for 6 months and will leave her alone if she refuses him after that time.\n\nMeanwhile, Veerapandi gets to know about Rajalingam's real nature and prevents him from smuggling sand. Rajalingam gets enraged and decides to kill Selvam in revenge. Rajalingam sends a few thugs to Trichy to kill Selvam, who beats up the goons. but Veerapandi and his men arrive anyway and threaten the rowdies. Afterwards, Veerapandi and Selvam force Rajalingam to donate land he bought with black money to the people. This causes Rajalingam to again get angry, and send rowdies from [[Madurai]] and [[Dindigul]] to kill Selvam again. When he is cornered, Selvam is forced to take up sickle and is filmed attacking the rowdies by many. This results in him getting arrested and jailed for 15 days, after which he returns to Pandiapuram. Radhika, after seeing his violence, decides not to disclose her love.\n\nSoon, Rajalingam becomes a minister and openly challenges Veerapandi since he doesn't need his support anymore. Radhika gets to know that it was Selvam who helped her uncle by recovering the money invested in disputed land. When Selvam and his sister go to an engagement ceremony Radhika is attending, Selvam implies he is waiting for her to propose. Radhika tells Selvam about her love, but also requests Selvam to leave his family. However, Selvam ditches Radhika, saying that his family is more important to him than anything else in the world. Later, Radhika realizes her mistake and apologizes to Selvam, and they reunite. Radhika then introduces herself to Selvam's parents. Meanwhile, Rajalingam plans to kill Veerapandi, knowing about his train journey based on information from Radhika. However, Selvam comes to the rescue and attacks his goons. Meanwhile the truck sent to hit Veerapandi's car kills an innocent family, whose deaths Veerapandi says will not go unpunished.\n\nVeerapandi realizes that he drank poisoned coffee and is rushed to the hospital, where his life is saved. Selvam is shocked to know that Radhika poisoned Veerapandi's coffee and informed Rajalingam about Veerapandi's travel plans. Selvam rushes to Radhika's home, where her mother Padmavathi ([[Sudha Chandran]]) and grandfather state that Veerapandi killed Radhika's father ([[Nizhalgal Ravi]]) years ago, and they were waiting for an opportunity to exact revenge. Veerapandi comes to Radhika's home and tells how it was the ruling party rowdies who killed Radhika's dad and it was not him who killed her father. Radhika's family feels guilty about their acts. Selvam feels bad that Radhika cheated him, so he leaves her.\n\nThe next day, Radhika's family apologizes to Veerapandi and informs that they are leaving. Veerapandi and his wife Thangam ([[Urvashi (actress)|Urvashi]]) forgive Radhika's mistake and urge Selvam to accept Radhika, which he does. Rajalingam hires 50 men from [[Rameswaram|Rameshwaram]] to kill both Veerapandi and Selvam. Selvam makes plan with other villagers to burn hayfields to make it look like job is already done, and goes to kill Rajalingam and goons himself. He gets men to distract Rajalingam's goons and kills them one by one. The burnt haystacks cause the Rameshawarm goons to think the job is done and they leave. Selvam then lures Rajalingam to a place where, after a fight, he stabs Rajalingam in the throat. He then flies to [[Kuala Lumpur]] and lives there for 6 months. Afterwards he returns to great happiness from all and reunites with Radhika.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Dhanush]] as Selvam(Tamil)/Shiva(Telugu)\n* [[Tamannaah]] as Radhika (Selvam's love interest)\n* [[Rajkiran]] as Veera Pandi (Selvam's father)\n* [[Prakash Raj]] as Minister Rajalingam (formerly MLA)\n* [[Srithika]] as Selvi (Selvam's sister)\n* [[Ganja Karuppu]] as Ganesan (Selvam's sidekick)\n* [[Nizhalgal Ravi]] as Radhika's father\n* [[Sudha Chandran]] as Padmavathi (Radhika's mother)\n* [[Urvashi (actress)|Urvashi]] as Thangam (Veera Pandi's wife)\n* [[Livingston (actor)|Livingston]] as Mariyappan (Selvam's uncle)\n* [[Paravai Muniyamma]] as Veera Pandi's house cook\n* [[Y.

Meanwhile the truck sent to hit Veerapandi's car kills an innocent family, whose deaths Veerapandi says will not go unpunished.\n\nVeerapandi realizes that he drank poisoned coffee and is rushed to the hospital, where his life is saved. Selvam is shocked to know that Radhika poisoned Veerapandi's coffee and informed Rajalingam about Veerapandi's travel plans. Selvam rushes to Radhika's home, where her mother Padmavathi ([[Sudha Chandran]]) and grandfather state that Veerapandi killed Radhika's father ([[Nizhalgal Ravi]]) years ago, and they were waiting for an opportunity to exact revenge. Veerapandi comes to Radhika's home and tells how it was the ruling party rowdies who killed Radhika's dad and it was not him who killed her father. Radhika's family feels guilty about their acts. Selvam feels bad that Radhika cheated him, so he leaves her.\n\nThe next day, Radhika's family apologizes to Veerapandi and informs that they are leaving. Veerapandi and his wife Thangam ([[Urvashi (actress)|Urvashi]]) forgive Radhika's mistake and urge Selvam to accept Radhika, which he does. Rajalingam hires 50 men from [[Rameswaram|Rameshwaram]] to kill both Veerapandi and Selvam. Selvam makes plan with other villagers to burn hayfields to make it look like job is already done, and goes to kill Rajalingam and goons himself. He gets men to distract Rajalingam's goons and kills them one by one. The burnt haystacks cause the Rameshawarm goons to think the job is done and they leave. Selvam then lures Rajalingam to a place where, after a fight, he stabs Rajalingam in the throat. He then flies to [[Kuala Lumpur]] and lives there for 6 months. Afterwards he returns to great happiness from all and reunites with Radhika.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Dhanush]] as Selvam(Tamil)/Shiva(Telugu)\n* [[Tamannaah]] as Radhika (Selvam's love interest)\n* [[Rajkiran]] as Veera Pandi (Selvam's father)\n* [[Prakash Raj]] as Minister Rajalingam (formerly MLA)\n* [[Srithika]] as Selvi (Selvam's sister)\n* [[Ganja Karuppu]] as Ganesan (Selvam's sidekick)\n* [[Nizhalgal Ravi]] as Radhika's father\n* [[Sudha Chandran]] as Padmavathi (Radhika's mother)\n* [[Urvashi (actress)|Urvashi]] as Thangam (Veera Pandi's wife)\n* [[Livingston (actor)|Livingston]] as Mariyappan (Selvam's uncle)\n* [[Paravai Muniyamma]] as Veera Pandi's house cook\n* [[Y.

The negative sign arises as positive charges repel, so a positive charge will experience a force away from the positively charged plate, in the opposite direction to that in which the voltage increases. In micro- and nano-applications, for instance in relation to semiconductors, a typical magnitude of an electric field is in the order of {{val|e=6|u=V\u22c5m<sup>\u22121</sup>}}, achieved by applying a voltage of the order of 1 volt between conductors spaced 1&nbsp;\u00b5m apart.\n\n==Electrodynamic fields==\n\n{{Main|Electrodynamics}}\n\nElectrodynamic fields are electric fields which do change with time, for instance when charges are in motion.\n\nThe electric field cannot be described independently of the magnetic field in that case.

It can be approximated by placing two conducting [[Capacitor#Parallel-plate model|plates]] parallel to each other and maintaining a [[voltage]] (potential difference) between them; it is only an approximation because of boundary effects (near the edge of the planes, electric field is distorted because the plane does not continue). Assuming infinite planes, the magnitude of the electric field ''E'' is:\n\n:<math> E = - \\frac{\\Delta V}{d}</math>\n\nwhere \u0394''V'' is the [[potential difference]] between the plates and ''d'' is the distance separating the plates. The negative sign arises as positive charges repel, so a positive charge will experience a force away from the positively charged plate, in the opposite direction to that in which the voltage increases. In micro- and nano-applications, for instance in relation to semiconductors, a typical magnitude of an electric field is in the order of {{val|e=6|u=V\u22c5m<sup>\u22121</sup>}}, achieved by applying a voltage of the order of 1 volt between conductors spaced 1&nbsp;\u00b5m apart.\n\n==Electrodynamic fields==\n\n{{Main|Electrodynamics}}\n\nElectrodynamic fields are electric fields which do change with time, for instance when charges are in motion.\n\nThe electric field cannot be described independently of the magnetic field in that case. If '''A''' is the [[magnetic vector potential]], defined so that <math> \\mathbf{B} = \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A} </math>, one can still define an electric potential <math> \\Phi</math> such that:\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{E} = - \\nabla \\Phi - \\frac { \\partial \\mathbf{A} } { \\partial t }</math>\n\nOne can recover [[Faraday's law of induction]] by taking the curl of that equation\n:<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Maxwell's Equations\n|first1=Paul G.\n|last1=Huray\n|publisher=Wiley-IEEE\n|year=2009\n|isbn=0-470-54276-4\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0QsDgdd0MhMCp\n|page= 205}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{\\partial (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A})} {\\partial t}=\n-\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}} {\\partial t}</math>\n\nwhich justifies, a posteriori, the previous form for '''E'''.\n\n==Energy in the electric field==\n\nThe total energy per unit volume stored by the [[electromagnetic field]] is<ref>Introduction to Electrodynamics (3rd Edition), D.J.

However, in the steady-state case, the fields are no longer coupled (see [[Maxwell's equations]]). It makes sense in that case to compute the electrostatic energy per unit volume:\n\n:<math> u_{ES} = \\frac{1}{2} \\varepsilon |\\mathbf{E}|^2 \\, ,</math>\n\nThe total energy ''U'' stored in the electric field in a given volume ''V'' is therefore\n:<math> U_{ES} = \\frac{1}{2} \\varepsilon \\int_{V} |\\mathbf{E}|^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}V \\, ,</math>\n\n==Further extensions==\n\n===Definitive equation of vector fields===\n\n{{See also|Defining equation (physics)|List of electromagnetism equations}}\n\nIn the presence of matter, it is helpful to extend the notion of the electric field into three vector fields:<ref name=\"auto\">Electromagnetism (2nd Edition), I.S.

Since '''E''' and '''P''' are defined separately, this equation can be used to define '''D'''. The physical interpretation of '''D''' is not as clear as '''E''' (effectively the field applied to the material) or '''P''' (induced field due to the dipoles in the material), but still serves as a convenient mathematical simplification, since Maxwell's equations can be simplified in terms of [[Maxwell's equations#Macroscopic formulation|free charges and currents]].\n\n===Constitutive relation===\n{{Main|Constitutive equation}}\n\nThe '''E''' and '''D''' fields are related by the [[permittivity]] of the material, ''\u03b5''.<ref>''Electricity and Modern Physics (2nd Edition)'', G.A.G.

He was a member of the [[Australia Davis Cup team|Australian team]] that won the [[Davis Cup]] four times between 1952 and 1956. Hoad turned professional in July 1957 and won the [[Tournament of Champions (tennis)|Forest Hills Tournament of Champions]] event in 1959. He also won the Ampol Tournament of Champions at Kooyong in 1958, one of the richest tournaments of the era. He won the Ampol Open Trophy world series in 1959\u20131960. During his career his main competitors were his longtime amateur tennis teammate [[Ken Rosewall]] and, throughout his professional career, [[Pancho Gonzales]].\n\nHoad was ranked in the world top ten for amateurs from 1952 until 1957, reaching the world No. 1 spot in 1956. He was ranked the world No. 1 professional in Kramer's official 1959\u20131960 Ampol ranking of all the contract professionals. He was ranked the world No. 1 tennis player, professional or amateur, for 1962 in a poll of 85 U.S. sports editors. \n\nSerious back problems plagued Hoad throughout his career, probably caused by a weight-lifting exercise he devised in 1954, particularly after he turned professional, and led to his effective retirement from tennis in 1967 although he made sporadic comebacks, enticed by the advent of the open era in 1968.\n\nIn his autobiography, [[Jack Kramer]], the professional tennis promoter and former player, rated Hoad as one of the 21 best players of all time.{{efn|name=kramer|Kramer considered the best player ever to have been either [[Don Budge]] (for consistent play) or [[Ellsworth Vines]] (at the height of his game).

He was a member of the [[Australia Davis Cup team|Australian team]] that won the [[Davis Cup]] four times between 1952 and 1956. Hoad turned professional in July 1957 and won the [[Tournament of Champions (tennis)|Forest Hills Tournament of Champions]] event in 1959. He also won the Ampol Tournament of Champions at Kooyong in 1958, one of the richest tournaments of the era. He won the Ampol Open Trophy world series in 1959\u20131960. During his career his main competitors were his longtime amateur tennis teammate [[Ken Rosewall]] and, throughout his professional career, [[Pancho Gonzales]].\n\nHoad was ranked in the world top ten for amateurs from 1952 until 1957, reaching the world No. 1 spot in 1956. He was ranked the world No. 1 professional in Kramer's official 1959\u20131960 Ampol ranking of all the contract professionals. He was ranked the world No. 1 tennis player, professional or amateur, for 1962 in a poll of 85 U.S. sports editors. \n\nSerious back problems plagued Hoad throughout his career, probably caused by a weight-lifting exercise he devised in 1954, particularly after he turned professional, and led to his effective retirement from tennis in 1967 although he made sporadic comebacks, enticed by the advent of the open era in 1968.\n\nIn his autobiography, [[Jack Kramer]], the professional tennis promoter and former player, rated Hoad as one of the 21 best players of all time.{{efn|name=kramer|Kramer considered the best player ever to have been either [[Don Budge]] (for consistent play) or [[Ellsworth Vines]] (at the height of his game). The next four best were, chronologically, [[Bill Tilden]], [[Fred Perry]], [[Bobby Riggs]], and [[Pancho Gonzales]]. After these six came the \"second echelon\" of [[Rod Laver]], Lew Hoad, [[Ken Rosewall]], [[Gottfried von Cramm]], [[Ted Schroeder]], [[Jack Crawford (tennis)|Jack Crawford]], [[Pancho Segura]], [[Frank Sedgman]], [[Tony Trabert]], [[John Newcombe]], [[Arthur Ashe]], [[Stan Smith]], [[Bj\u00f6rn Borg]], and [[Jimmy Connors]]. He felt unable to rank [[Henri Cochet]] and [[Ren\u00e9 Lacoste]] accurately but felt they were among the very best.}} [[Rod Laver]] in 2012 rated Hoad as the greatest player of the \"past champions\" era of tennis and stated that power, volleying and explosiveness were his strengths.\n\nFollowing his retirement in 1972, Hoad and his wife [[Jenny Staley Hoad|Jenny]] operated a tennis resort, ''Lew Hoad's Campo de Tenis'' in [[Fuengirola]], Spain, near M\u00e1laga. Hoad died of leukemia on 3 July 1994.\n\n==Early life and career==\n[[Image:Australian tennis player Lewis Hoad.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Lewis Hoad at age 15 competing at Kooyong in Inter State Tennis in 1949.]]\nLewis Hoad{{efn|name=actor|Lewis Hoad was named after the American actor [[Lewis Stone]].{{sfnp|Hoad|2002|p=3|ps=}}}} was born on 23 November 1934, in the working-class Sydney inner suburb of [[Glebe, New South Wales|Glebe]], the eldest of three sons of tramway electrician Alan Hoad and his wife Ailsa Lyle Burbury.{{sfnp|Hoad|2002|p=3|ps=}} Hoad started playing tennis at age five with a racket gifted by a local social club.{{sfnp|Davidson|1970|pp=105,106|ps=}} As a young child, he would wake up at 5 a.m. and hit tennis balls against a wall and garage door until the neighbours complained, and he was allowed to practice on the courts of the Hereford Tennis Club behind the house.{{sfnp|Hoad|2002|pp=3,4|ps=}}{{sfnp|Davidson|1970|p=106|ps=}} At age 10 he competed in the seaside tournament at [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]] in the under 16 category.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17933284 |title=School for Tennis Juniors. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=28 December 1944 |accessdate=14 June 2014 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nIn his youth, he often played with [[Ken Rosewall]], and they became known as the Sydney \"twins\", although they had very different physiques, personalities and playing styles. Their first match was in their early teens and was played as an opener of an exhibition match between Australia and America. Rosewall won 6\u20130, 6\u20130.{{sfnp|Davidson|1970|p=107|ps=}} Hoad built up great physical strength, especially in his hands and arms, by training at a police boys' club, where he made a name as a boxer. Hoad was about 12 when he was introduced to [[Adrian Quist]], a former Australian tennis champion and then general manager of the [[Dunlop Sport|Dunlop]] sports goods company. Quist played a couple of sets with Hoad and was impressed by his natural ability. When Hoad was 14 he left school and joined the Dunlop payroll, following the pattern of that 'shamateur' era when most of Australia's brightest tennis prospects were employed by sporting goods companies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Obituary: Lew Hoad|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-lew-hoad-1411724.html|publisher=The Independent|date=5 July 1994}}</ref>\n\nHoad had just turned 15 when he and Rosewall were selected to play for [[New South Wales]] in an interstate contest against [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18128860 |title=Rosewall, Hoad in state team. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=25 November 1949 |page=10 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> In November 1949, Hoad won the junior title at the New South Wales Championships, and the same weekend, he also competed in the final of the junior [[table tennis]] championship in Sydney.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article48607374 |title=N.S.W.
