No one could win over him due to the power of this Shiva Lingam. In the war between the Devas and Asuras under Tarakasura, [[Karitkeya]] and Tarakasura were face to face. Kartikeya used his Shakti Aayudham to k\u00edll Tarakasura. By the power of Shakti Aayudha the body of Tarakasura was torn to pieces. But to the astonishment of Kartikeya, all the pieces reunited to give rise to [[Tarakasura|Taraka]]. He repeatedly broke the body into pieces and yet the pieces re-unified repeatedly.\n\nLord Kumara Swamy was confused and was in an embarrassed state. Lord Sriman Narayana appeared before him and said \u201cKumara! Don\u2019t get depressed. Without breaking the Shiva Lingam worn by the asura you can\u2019t k\u00edll him\u201d (\"You should first break the Shiva Lingam into pieces, then only you can k\u00edll Taraka\", meant Lord Vishnu). He said that after breaking, the Shiva Lingam will try to unite. To prevent the Lingam from uniting all the pieces should be fixed in the place where they fall, by way of worshiping them and building temples for them.\n\nBy taking the word of Lord Vishnu, Lord Kumara Swamy used his Aagneyaastra (weapon of fire) to break the Shiva Lingam worn by Taraka. The Lingam broke into five pieces and was trying to unite by making Omkara nada (chanting [[Om]]). Then Surya Deva by the order of Lord Vishnu, fixed the pieces and worshipped them by building temples over them. By the formation of temples, the pieces stopped their movement and became famous as Panchaarama Kshetras. All the five Shiva Lingams in these five places have scale-like marks on them which are believed to have formed by the power of Aagneyaastra used by Lord Kumara Swamy.\n[[Image:Draksharama temple - Main entrance.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Main entrance to the Bhimeswara Swamy temple (view from inside the temple).]]\n[[File:Kumara Bhimarama Temple at Samalkota.jpg|thumb|200px|Kumara Bhimarama Temple at [[Samalkota]]]]\nAccording to legend, these five pieces were installed as Siva Lingams at five temples by [[Indra]], [[Surya]], [[Chandra]], [[Vishnu]] and Kumara Swamy at the respective places.\n\n==Temples==\n\nThese places (or ''Aaramas'') are as follows:\n\n*'''[[Amararama]]''' (in [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]]): Amaravati is in Guntur district, on the bank of [[Krishna river]]. The remaining four are in Godavari districts (two in east Godavari and the other two in west Godavari). Bus facility is good, as all buses will go up to the temple. Amara Lingeswara swami is worshipped by Lord [[Indra]] here. The temple is old and in three circles with many temples within the compound. Bala Chamundeswari mata is the goddess here. Venu Gopala swami temple is also in the campus of the main temple.\n*'''[[Draksharama]]''' (in [[Draksharamam]]): This is near [[Ramachandrapuram, East Godavari|Ramachandrapuram]]. The temple is very big and has three circles as compounds. It is under the control of the Archeological department. Lord Shri Rama worshiped Lord Shiva here, followed by Lord Surya and Indra. Manikyamaba devi, one of 18 shaktipeethas is present here. [[Vemulawada Bheemakavi|Vemulavada Bhima kavi]], famous Telugu poet born in [[Vemulawada, Karimnagar Dist Telangana]].\n*'''[[Somarama]]''' (in [[Bhimavaram]]): Someswara swami temple is in Gunupudi. It is about 3 to 4&nbsp;km from the bus stand. The temple looks new, and has a holy pond called Chandra kundam. Chandra kundam is in front of the temple. Lord Chandra got rid of his sins here by worshiping Lord Shiva here. Hence the name Someswara swami. Shivalingam change its color according to the lunar month (black at the time of Amavasya, white at the time of Pournami). Annapurna mata temple is on the second floor.\n*'''[[Ksheerarama]]''' (in [[Palakollu]]): Ksheera Rama Lingeswara swamy gave Sudarshana chakra to Lord Vishnu here. Upamanya Maharshi got boons and milk from Lord Shiva, hence the name Ksheera (milk) Ramalingeswara swami. The temple is near the bus stand. The temple Gopuram is very high and can be seen from the bus stand. [[Parvati]] is the goddess.\n*'''[[Kumararama]]''' (in [[Samalkota]]): Kumara Bhimeswara swami temple is in Samarlkota. It is about 20&nbsp;km from Kakinada and about 1&nbsp;km from Samarlakota Railway station. It is a very old temple under the control of the Archeological department. Lord Shiva is in the form of very big Shivalinga and one can see Shivalinga through second floor. Kumara swami laid down Shiva Linga here, hence the name Kumararamam.

Taken over by the U.S. [[Maritime Commission]] in the summer of 1941 under the authority of Public Law 101, 77th Congress and Executive Order 8771, 6 June 1941, she was renamed ''Pontiac'' and operated by [[United States Lines]] between New York and [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] until 5 February 1942.

Between late January and May 1944 she conducted sugar runs between Norfolk and [[Trinidad]], [[Guant\u00e1namo Bay]] and [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], then returned to Boston to resume runs to Argentia and, in June, to [[Iceland]].\n\nShe completed a quick run to [[Bermuda]] in early August, then returned to the Boston-Argentia route before undertaking her last [[Caribbean]] run from New York 7 September. On 25 September she arrived at Norfolk from San Juan, made a trip to Bermuda and on 16 November returned to Boston to resume carrying stores to [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]]. For the next two months she alternated voyages to Argentia with runs to Bermuda and on 29 January 1945 departed Boston for her last run to [[Canada]].

However, Ravaisson developed his doctrine as what he called \u2018spiritualist realism\u2019 and \u2018spiritualist positivism\u2019, and - according to Ravaisson scholar [[Mark Sinclair (philosopher)|Mark Sinclair]] - can be thought of as founding 'the school of contingency'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9-10\">\"Sinclair (2019), pp. 9-10</ref> His most well known and influential successor was [[Henri Bergson]], with whom the tradition can be seen to end during the 1930s;<ref name=\"SinclairBI-1\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 1</ref> although the 'lineage' of this 'philosophy of life' can be seen to return in the late twentieth century with [[Gilles Deleuze]].<ref name=\"GroszHT-219\">\"Grosz (2013), p. 219</ref> Ravaisson never worked in the French state university system, in his late 20s declining a position at the University of Rennes.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-7\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 7</ref> In 1838 he was employed as the principle private secretary to the Minister of Public Instruction, going on to secure high-ranking positions such as Inspector General of Libraries, and then the Curator of Classical Antiquities at the [[Louvre]].<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> Later in his life he was appointed as the President of the Jury of the Aggregation of philosophy in France, 'a position of considerable influence'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 9</ref> Ravaisson, was not only a philosopher, classicist, archivist, and educational administrator, but also a painter exhibiting under the name Lach\u00e9.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> \n\n==Biography==\n\n[[File:Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau - Portrait of Jean-Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Larcher Ravaisson-Mollien.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A portrait of F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau.|F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau (1846)]]\n\nRavaisson was born at [[Namur]]. After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\n==Philosophy==\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson's 'complete' 'three major' philosophical works are: ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d\u2019Aristote'' [Vol. 1 & Vol. 2] (1837 and 1846); ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''On Habit'', 1838); and ''Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme si\u00e8cle'' (1867).<ref name=\"SinclairBI-6\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 6</ref><ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-4-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), pp. 4-5</ref> Ravaisson also produced a number of other 'noteworthy essays' such as \"La Philosophie contemporaine\" (\"Contemporary Philosophy\", 1840); \"La Philosophie de Pascale\" (\"Pascal\u2019s Philosophy\", 1887), and \"M\u00e9taphysique et Morale\" (\"Metaphysics and Morals\", 1893).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref> Upon his death he also 'left unfinished fragments of a major work, which were published posthumously', first as \"Testament philosophique\" in ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale'' (\"Philosophical Testament\", 1901), then later in extended form as ''Testament philosophique'' (''Philosophical Testament'', 1933).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref><ref name=\"SinclairI-vii\">\"Sinclair (2016), p. vii</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!

However, Ravaisson developed his doctrine as what he called \u2018spiritualist realism\u2019 and \u2018spiritualist positivism\u2019, and - according to Ravaisson scholar [[Mark Sinclair (philosopher)|Mark Sinclair]] - can be thought of as founding 'the school of contingency'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9-10\">\"Sinclair (2019), pp. 9-10</ref> His most well known and influential successor was [[Henri Bergson]], with whom the tradition can be seen to end during the 1930s;<ref name=\"SinclairBI-1\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 1</ref> although the 'lineage' of this 'philosophy of life' can be seen to return in the late twentieth century with [[Gilles Deleuze]].<ref name=\"GroszHT-219\">\"Grosz (2013), p. 219</ref> Ravaisson never worked in the French state university system, in his late 20s declining a position at the University of Rennes.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-7\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 7</ref> In 1838 he was employed as the principle private secretary to the Minister of Public Instruction, going on to secure high-ranking positions such as Inspector General of Libraries, and then the Curator of Classical Antiquities at the [[Louvre]].<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> Later in his life he was appointed as the President of the Jury of the Aggregation of philosophy in France, 'a position of considerable influence'.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-9\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 9</ref> Ravaisson, was not only a philosopher, classicist, archivist, and educational administrator, but also a painter exhibiting under the name Lach\u00e9.<ref name=\"SinclairBI-8\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 8</ref> \n\n==Biography==\n\n[[File:Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau - Portrait of Jean-Gaspard-F\u00e9lix Larcher Ravaisson-Mollien.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A portrait of F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau.|F\u00e9lix Ravaisson by Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau (1846)]]\n\nRavaisson was born at [[Namur]]. After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\n==Philosophy==\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson's 'complete' 'three major' philosophical works are: ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d\u2019Aristote'' [Vol. 1 & Vol. 2] (1837 and 1846); ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''On Habit'', 1838); and ''Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme si\u00e8cle'' (1867).<ref name=\"SinclairBI-6\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 6</ref><ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-4-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), pp. 4-5</ref> Ravaisson also produced a number of other 'noteworthy essays' such as \"La Philosophie contemporaine\" (\"Contemporary Philosophy\", 1840); \"La Philosophie de Pascale\" (\"Pascal\u2019s Philosophy\", 1887), and \"M\u00e9taphysique et Morale\" (\"Metaphysics and Morals\", 1893).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref> Upon his death he also 'left unfinished fragments of a major work, which were published posthumously', first as \"Testament philosophique\" in ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale'' (\"Philosophical Testament\", 1901), then later in extended form as ''Testament philosophique'' (''Philosophical Testament'', 1933).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref><ref name=\"SinclairI-vii\">\"Sinclair (2016), p. vii</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!

His chess career and his family's unconventional lifestyle were the subjects of many articles and TV shows.<ref>http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessuser?user=jeff+sarwer</ref>\n\nSarwer's attacking playing style was often compared to [[Bobby Fischer]], and a tournament game drawn against him by another young chess player, [[Joshua Waitzkin]], was the inspiration for the climax in the film ''[[Searching for Bobby Fischer]]''.\n\nSarwer won the under-10 [[World Youth Chess Championship]] in Puerto Rico in 1986 representing Canada.\n\nWhen Sarwer was 8, he was believed by many to be one of the strongest prodigies in the history of the game. [[Allen Kaufman]], head of the American Chess Foundation, said, \"Jeff at 9 is stronger than Bobby was at 11.\"  [[Bruce Pandolfini]] said, \"Of the several thousand kids I've taught, Jeff is certainly the most amazing young player I've ever seen.\"\n\n== Early career ==\nBorn in [[Kingston, Ontario]] to a [[Finns|Finnish]] mother and a Canadian father,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140112101607/http://www.pokerista.net/puoliksi-suomalainen-jeff-sarwer-shakkia-ja-pokeria/ Puoliksi suomalainen Jeff Sarwer \u2013 shakkia ja pokeria] (archived) {{in lang|fi}} Pokerista</ref> Sarwer learned the rules of [[chess]] at the age of 4 from his 6-year-old sister, Julia, and at age of 6 started to play at the [[Manhattan Chess Club]], which was one of the most prestigious chess clubs in the world at the time. [[Bruce Pandolfini]] was the manager of the club, and being impressed with them gave him and his sister free life memberships, which were usually reserved for grandmasters.\n\nSarwer used to entertain large crowds by playing 40 people at the same time known as [[Simultaneous exhibition|simultaneous chess]], every [[Canada Day]] from the age of 7 on [[Parliament Hill]] in [[Ottawa]]. He also used to show up and play [[Fast chess|speed chess]] at Washington Square Park in New York City, where large numbers of people gathered to watch his games.\n\n== Media life ==\nAt the age of 7, Sarwer\n's enthusiasm for the game caught the attention of Grandmaster [[Edmar Mednis]] and he invited him to analyze the 1986 World Championship Match between Kasparov-Karpov on PBS. Sarwer and his sister Julia (who was also a world champion for girls under 10) continued to do this for the rematch in 1987 as well. After this Jeff and Julia became well known in media circles and appeared on various talk shows and were the subject of a documentary.\n\nMagazines such as ''[[GQ]]'' and ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' wrote articles about Sarwer and his family, often highlighting their bizarre lifestyle and questioning his safety and chess career under his father's care.\n\n== ''Vanity Fair'' article ==\nJeff's father did not allow him to continue his chess career when it became apparent that he would not be able to keep full control over Jeff's life. He moved the family away from New York City and ran into trouble with The Children's Aid Society of Ontario. A featured article in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine by [[John Colapinto]] detailed child abuse of Jeff and Julia and prompted the C.A.S. to take him and his sister into protective custody.\n\nJeff and Julia ran away from the C.A.S. back to their father and hid out from authorities in order to not be taken away into custody again. The Sarwers lived in various countries and got used to living an anonymous lifestyle.\n\n== ''Searching For Bobby Fischer'' ==\n{{algebraic notation|pos=secright}}\nIn 1993 the film ''[[Searching for Bobby Fischer]]'' was released and Jeff Sarwer's character was portrayed as \"Jonathan Poe\". In the film's final game, Poe declined the [[draw by agreement|offer]] of a [[draw (chess)|draw]] and eventually lost. In reality, Sarwer declined the draw offer by Josh Waitzkin, but the game ended in a draw (because of insufficient material) a few moves later. Under tournament [[Tie-breaking in Swiss-system tournaments|tie-breaking rules]], Waitzkin was determined to have played more challenging opponents during the overall competition and was awarded first place, but they were declared US Primary School co-champions.  At the time that the game was played, Sarwer was 7 and Waitzkin 9 years old.\n\n:Sarwer vs. Waitzkin, 1986 <br />1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.f4 0-0 6.Nf3 Nbd7 7.e5 Ne8 8.Bd3 c5 9.dxc5 Nxc5 10.Bc2 a5 11.0-0 b6 12.Be3 Bb7 13.Qd4 dxe5 14.Nxe5 Qxd4 15.Bxd4 Rd8 16.Bxc5 bxc5 17.Na4 Bxe5 18.fxe5 Rd2 19.Rf2 Rxf2 20.Kxf2 f6 21.e6 Nd6 22.Nxc5 Rc8 23.Nxb7 Nxb7 24.b3 Nc5 25.Re1 Rc6 26.Be4 Ra6 27.Bc2 Rxe6 28.Rxe6 Nxe6 29.Ke3 Kf8 30.Ke4 Ke8 31.g3 Kd7 32.Kd5 f5 33.a3 h6 34.b4 axb4 35.axb4 Nc7+ 36.Kc5 e5 37.Ba4+ Kc8 38.Bc6 e4 39.b5 e3 40.Bf3 Ne6+ 41.Kd5 Ng5 42.Be2 Kc7 43.Ke5 Ne4 44.Kd4 Kd6 45.Kxe3 Kc5 46.g4 Nd6 47.Kf4 g5+ 48.Ke5 fxg4 49.Kf6 g3 50.hxg3 Ne4+ 51.Kg6 Nxg3 52.Bd3 Nh1 53.Kxh6 g4 54.Kg5 g3 55.Be4 Nf2 56.Bd5 Nd1 57.Kf4 Nc3 58.Bc6 Ne2+ 59.Kf3 Nd4+ 60.Kxg3 Nxc6 61.bxc6 Kxc6 62.Kf3 Kc5 63.Ke3 Kxc4 \u00bd\u2013\u00bd<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1473029 Sarwer vs. Waitzkin] [[Chessgames.com]]</ref>\n\n== Resurfacing ==\nAfter he disappeared at a very young age, many people thought Sarwer would not be seen playing chess again. In September 2007 he resurfaced to the chess scene, apparently without training and entered a 30-minute [[rapid chess|semi-rapid]] tournament at Malbork castle in Poland. He finished in third place with a score of 7/9 in a group of 86 players including four grandmasters.  Since he had no active chess rating, he was given a provisional [[Elo rating system|Elo rating]] of 2250 [[FIDE]] but seemed to perform above that level. In January 2010 Sarwer gave a long interview to ''Chess Life Online'' detailing his experiences from that tournament and talking about his current life in Europe. In August 2010, Sarwer was profiled in the ''Sunday Times Magazine'' talking about his father's methods, his chess career and his reappearance in public.

His chess career and his family's unconventional lifestyle were the subjects of many articles and TV shows.<ref>http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessuser?user=jeff+sarwer</ref>\n\nSarwer's attacking playing style was often compared to [[Bobby Fischer]], and a tournament game drawn against him by another young chess player, [[Joshua Waitzkin]], was the inspiration for the climax in the film ''[[Searching for Bobby Fischer]]''.\n\nSarwer won the under-10 [[World Youth Chess Championship]] in Puerto Rico in 1986 representing Canada.\n\nWhen Sarwer was 8, he was believed by many to be one of the strongest prodigies in the history of the game. [[Allen Kaufman]], head of the American Chess Foundation, said, \"Jeff at 9 is stronger than Bobby was at 11.\"  [[Bruce Pandolfini]] said, \"Of the several thousand kids I've taught, Jeff is certainly the most amazing young player I've ever seen.\"\n\n== Early career ==\nBorn in [[Kingston, Ontario]] to a [[Finns|Finnish]] mother and a Canadian father,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140112101607/http://www.pokerista.net/puoliksi-suomalainen-jeff-sarwer-shakkia-ja-pokeria/ Puoliksi suomalainen Jeff Sarwer \u2013 shakkia ja pokeria] (archived) {{in lang|fi}} Pokerista</ref> Sarwer learned the rules of [[chess]] at the age of 4 from his 6-year-old sister, Julia, and at age of 6 started to play at the [[Manhattan Chess Club]], which was one of the most prestigious chess clubs in the world at the time. [[Bruce Pandolfini]] was the manager of the club, and being impressed with them gave him and his sister free life memberships, which were usually reserved for grandmasters.\n\nSarwer used to entertain large crowds by playing 40 people at the same time known as [[Simultaneous exhibition|simultaneous chess]], every [[Canada Day]] from the age of 7 on [[Parliament Hill]] in [[Ottawa]]. He also used to show up and play [[Fast chess|speed chess]] at Washington Square Park in New York City, where large numbers of people gathered to watch his games.\n\n== Media life ==\nAt the age of 7, Sarwer\n's enthusiasm for the game caught the attention of Grandmaster [[Edmar Mednis]] and he invited him to analyze the 1986 World Championship Match between Kasparov-Karpov on PBS. Sarwer and his sister Julia (who was also a world champion for girls under 10) continued to do this for the rematch in 1987 as well. After this Jeff and Julia became well known in media circles and appeared on various talk shows and were the subject of a documentary.\n\nMagazines such as ''[[GQ]]'' and ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' wrote articles about Sarwer and his family, often highlighting their bizarre lifestyle and questioning his safety and chess career under his father's care.\n\n== ''Vanity Fair'' article ==\nJeff's father did not allow him to continue his chess career when it became apparent that he would not be able to keep full control over Jeff's life. He moved the family away from New York City and ran into trouble with The Children's Aid Society of Ontario. A featured article in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine by [[John Colapinto]] detailed child abuse of Jeff and Julia and prompted the C.A.S. to take him and his sister into protective custody.\n\nJeff and Julia ran away from the C.A.S. back to their father and hid out from authorities in order to not be taken away into custody again. The Sarwers lived in various countries and got used to living an anonymous lifestyle.\n\n== ''Searching For Bobby Fischer'' ==\n{{algebraic notation|pos=secright}}\nIn 1993 the film ''[[Searching for Bobby Fischer]]'' was released and Jeff Sarwer's character was portrayed as \"Jonathan Poe\". In the film's final game, Poe declined the [[draw by agreement|offer]] of a [[draw (chess)|draw]] and eventually lost. In reality, Sarwer declined the draw offer by Josh Waitzkin, but the game ended in a draw (because of insufficient material) a few moves later. Under tournament [[Tie-breaking in Swiss-system tournaments|tie-breaking rules]], Waitzkin was determined to have played more challenging opponents during the overall competition and was awarded first place, but they were declared US Primary School co-champions.  At the time that the game was played, Sarwer was 7 and Waitzkin 9 years old.\n\n:Sarwer vs. Waitzkin, 1986 <br />1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.f4 0-0 6.Nf3 Nbd7 7.e5 Ne8 8.Bd3 c5 9.dxc5 Nxc5 10.Bc2 a5 11.0-0 b6 12.Be3 Bb7 13.Qd4 dxe5 14.Nxe5 Qxd4 15.Bxd4 Rd8 16.Bxc5 bxc5 17.Na4 Bxe5 18.fxe5 Rd2 19.Rf2 Rxf2 20.Kxf2 f6 21.e6 Nd6 22.Nxc5 Rc8 23.Nxb7 Nxb7 24.b3 Nc5 25.Re1 Rc6 26.Be4 Ra6 27.Bc2 Rxe6 28.Rxe6 Nxe6 29.Ke3 Kf8 30.Ke4 Ke8 31.g3 Kd7 32.Kd5 f5 33.a3 h6 34.b4 axb4 35.axb4 Nc7+ 36.Kc5 e5 37.Ba4+ Kc8 38.Bc6 e4 39.b5 e3 40.Bf3 Ne6+ 41.Kd5 Ng5 42.Be2 Kc7 43.Ke5 Ne4 44.Kd4 Kd6 45.Kxe3 Kc5 46.g4 Nd6 47.Kf4 g5+ 48.Ke5 fxg4 49.Kf6 g3 50.hxg3 Ne4+ 51.Kg6 Nxg3 52.Bd3 Nh1 53.Kxh6 g4 54.Kg5 g3 55.Be4 Nf2 56.Bd5 Nd1 57.Kf4 Nc3 58.Bc6 Ne2+ 59.Kf3 Nd4+ 60.Kxg3 Nxc6 61.bxc6 Kxc6 62.Kf3 Kc5 63.Ke3 Kxc4 \u00bd\u2013\u00bd<ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1473029 Sarwer vs. Waitzkin] [[Chessgames.com]]</ref>\n\n== Resurfacing ==\nAfter he disappeared at a very young age, many people thought Sarwer would not be seen playing chess again. In September 2007 he resurfaced to the chess scene, apparently without training and entered a 30-minute [[rapid chess|semi-rapid]] tournament at Malbork castle in Poland. He finished in third place with a score of 7/9 in a group of 86 players including four grandmasters.  Since he had no active chess rating, he was given a provisional [[Elo rating system|Elo rating]] of 2250 [[FIDE]] but seemed to perform above that level. In January 2010 Sarwer gave a long interview to ''Chess Life Online'' detailing his experiences from that tournament and talking about his current life in Europe. In August 2010, Sarwer was profiled in the ''Sunday Times Magazine'' talking about his father's methods, his chess career and his reappearance in public.

She was taken in hand at Longhope, part of the [[Scapa Flow]] naval base in the [[Orkney Islands]].\nShe was armed with five guns originally; this was increased later in the campaign. These were a 12 pounder, two 6 pdr and two 3 pdr guns, hidden behind screens and dummy fixtures. ''Penshurst'' was manned with a volunteer crew and commanded by Cdr FH Grenfell. She commissioned on 6 November 1915.\n\n==Service history==\n''Penshurst'' commenced operations around the North coast of Scotland before being transferred in spring 1916 to [[Cobh|Queenstown]], operating around the coast of Ireland and in the English Channel.\nFor almost a year she had little success; during 1916 the German Navy had scaled down their [[Atlantic U-boat Campaign (World War I)|U-boat operations]] against commerce around Britain, and there were few contacts in this theatre.\n\nOn 29 November 1916 ''Penshurst'' fell in with a U-boat which was attacking the steamer ''Wileyside''. ''Penshurst'' was able to approach to 3000 yards before the U-boat ordered her to stop. Grenfell's crew went through their \"abandon ship\" evolution, putting out boats manned by a \"panic party\", while ''Penshurst'' stopped, waiting for the U-boat to come closer. However the U-boat declined to come closer, and with it partly hidden in the glare of the setting sun ''Penshurst'' opened fire. She got several shots off before the U-boat dived, and closed to drop depth charges on the spot, but the U-boat (which was unidentified) escaped.\n\nThe following day on 30 November ''Penshurst'', having changed her appearance and moved to a different part of the Channel, came upon a U-boat, [[SM UB-19|''UB-19'']] attacking the steamer ''Ibex''. She again closed, but was overtaken by an approaching seaplane, which bombed the  U-boat as it quickly submerged. \nWhen the pilot became aware of who ''Penshurst'' was he landed, and agreed to spot for her while she dropped depth charges. However, on take-off the seaplane went out of control and crashed into the sea. As ''Penshurst'' stopped to pick up the crew, the U-boat, thinking it was safe, came to the surface again to attack. Taking the opportunity, Grenfell waited until the U-boat drew nearer, then opened fire. ''UB-19'' was fatally damaged and sank. Grenfell was awarded the DSO for this achievement.<ref>Kemp p21</ref>\n\nOn 14 January ''Penshurst'' was able to repeat her success. Two months later she was on patrol in the Channel when she encountered a U-boat, [[SM UB-37|''UB-37'']]. The U-boat closed in, opening fire at 3,000 yards. Grenfell sent off his panic party, and allowed ''Penshurst'' to turn as she slowed, to be broadside-on to the U-boat. However, the U-boat made to cross ''Penshurst's'' bow, continuing to fire, causing damage and several casualties over a twenty-minute period. At length, when no further advantage could be gained, ''Penshurst'' opened fire, and scored several hits with her first shots. ''UB-37'' was crippled and started to sink, and ''Penshurst'' finished her attack by dropping depth charges over the site. ''UB-37'' was destroyed, with no survivors.<ref>Kemp p23</ref>\n\nOn 20 February ''Penshurst'' again encountered a U-boat in the [[Southwest Approaches]]. She was again attacked, and after the U-boat closed was able to fire on her, causing damage. The U-boat submerged and was depth charged, but on this occasion was able to escape, returning to base despite the damage.\n\nTwo days later on 22 February ''Penshurst'' again met with a U-boat, [[SM U-84|''U-84'']], which had just sunk the sailing ship ''Invercauld''. As ''Penshurst'' drew up to pick up ''Invercauld''{{'}}s survivors, ''U-84'' fired a torpedo at her, which was narrowly avoided. ''Penshurst'' then feigned running, but at half speed, and, as the U-boat opened fire, sent off her boat party. ''U-84'' submerged to examine ''Penshurst'' in safety, but was satisfied, surfacing 600 yards away. ''Penshurst'' was then able to open fire, damaging the U-boat, and dropping depth charges as she submerged. As she did this, ''Penshurst'' was joined by the sloop [[HMS Alyssum (1915)|''Alyssum'']], which joined the attack. However, ''U-84'' was able to surface, away from the two hunters, and fled on the surface, outstripping her two pursuers.\n\nThe following month, on 30 March, ''Penshurst'' again encountered a U-boat, [[SM UB-32|''UB-32'']], but on this occasion the U-boat was able to inflict severe damage to her before escaping. ''Penshurst'' was towed back to [[Portsmouth]] where she was docked for repairs and a refit.\n\nOn 2 July, back in service and under a new commander, Lt C Naylor, ''Penshurst'' was again in the SW Approaches when she fell in with another U-boat. The boat submerged as ''Penshurst'' approached and fired a torpedo, which missed. Naylor sent his boat party off, and then waited for the U-boat to  come into range. ''Penshurst'' was under fire for some thirty minutes until she was able to open fire herself. The U-boat was damaged, but again was able to escape, despite the arrival of a group of destroyers. For this action, and his resolution under fire, Naylor received the [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]].\n\nOn 19 August ''Penshurst'' was following up a report from a merchantman when she fell in with [[SM UC-72|''UC-72'']]. As she approached, the U-boat fired a torpedo, which struck below the bridge. As the boat surfaced, ''Penshurst'' fired using a 3 pdr gun she carried in plain sight. By this stage of the campaign many merchant ships were defensively armed, and a Q-ship would look suspicious if she did not do the same.<ref>Chatterton p126</ref> It was a further development in the process of bluff and double-bluff which typified the Q-ship campaign. However ''UC-72'' was not fooled by this lacklustre response, and ''Penshurt'' was not fully under control, so Naylor refrained from sending off his boat party, but opened fire with all guns. He had also sent a distress call, and after a short time was joined by the destroyer [[HMS Leonidas (1913)|''Leonidas'']]. At this ''UC-72'' submerged and fled.\n\n''Penshurst'', escorted by ''Leonidas'' then made her way back to Plymouth, where she remained in dock for repair and refit. One of the changes was to improve her armament, adding two 4-inch guns and upgrading to two 12 pdr and two 6 pdr guns. These were re-positioned to give more firepower over the bow and stern. These changes were to take account of the changes in U-boat armament and tactics.<ref>Chatterton p128</ref>\n\n==Fate==\nOn 24 December 1917 ''Penshurst'' was again on patrol in the southern part of the Irish Sea, when she encountered a U-boat off [[Smalls Lighthouse|The Smalls]]. The boat, [[SM U-110|''U-110'']], submerged in order to let ''Penshurst'' come into range, and just after midday fired a torpedo, which hit her in the engine room. Naylor sent his boat crew off, but ''U-110'' remained under for two hours, examining the ship, until she surfaced off ''Penshurst's'' bow and commenced shelling. ''Penshurst'' replied, but was unable to bring all her guns to bear, as she was down by the stern. She scored some hits, but ''U-110'' submerged again, and, when a RN [[British P class patrol boat|submarine chaser]] arrived around 4 pm, made off, having suffered little damage.\n\n''Penshurst'', however, was seriously hurt, and despite attempts to bring her home, she sank at 8.05 pm. All her crew were successfully removed, though stoker 1st class Albert Brewer died later the same day.<ref>[http://irishmedals.org/gpage51.html Irish medals web page, including Albert Brewer.]</ref>\nNaylor was awarded a second bar to his DSO for this action.\n\n''Penshurst'' was one of the RN\u2019s most successful Q-ships, fighting eleven engagements over a two-year period, and destroying two U-boats and damaging several others in that time.<ref>Ritchie p. 192.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Chatterton, E Keble : ''Q-Ships and their story''.

After his family lost their possessions as a result of the [[Cuban Revolution]], he moved to the United States.<ref>See his autobiography included in a volume entitled ''\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 Espa\u00f1a?  Memorias del hispanismo estadounidense'', eds. Anna Caballe Masrorroll and Randolph D. Pope. Barcelona: Galaxia Gutenberg, 2015.</ref> De Armas holds a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] (1969), and has taught at [[Louisiana State University]] (1969\u20131988), [[Pennsylvania State University]] (where he was [[Edwin Erle Sparks]] Professor of Spanish and Comparative Literature) (1988\u20132000) and has been a visiting professor at [[Duke University]] (1994). Since 2000 he has been at the [[University of Chicago]] where he is [[Andrew W. Mellon]] Distinguished Service Professor in the Departments of Romance Languages and Literatures and Comparative Literature. He has served as Chair of Romance Languages and Literatures (2006\u20132009; 2010\u20132012). In addition he has been Vice President and President of the Cervantes Society of America (2003\u20132009); and President of AISO Asociacion Internacional Siglo de Oro (2015-2017).\n\n==Career==\nDe Armas' publications focus on early modern Spanish literature and culture, often from a comparative perspective. His interests include the politics of astrology, magic and the Hermetic tradition, [[ekphrasis]], verbal and visual culture, etc.<ref>Carrie L. Ruiz, \"Oscillating trends: A Reflection of the Status of Seventeenth-Century Studies Today: Interview of Frederick A. de Armas\" ''Transitions. Journal of Franco-Iberian Studies'' 5 (2009), pp. 9-25</ref> His early books evince an interest in the relationship between mythology and literature, between the classics and [[Spanish Golden Age]] works. They include: ''The Invisible Mistress: Aspects of Feminism and Fantasy in the Golden Age'' (1976), which contains some of the earliest discussions of proto-feminism in early modern Spain,<ref>''The Perception of Women in Spanish Theater of the Golden Age''. Ed. Anita K. Stoll and Dawn L. Smith. Lewisburg: Bucknell University Press, 1991, p. 19</ref> and ''The Return of Astraea: An Astral-Imperial Myth in Calder\u00f3n'' (1986), which is one of the first studies that approach Calder\u00f3n from a historicist perspective and is also deeply influenced by the writings of the [[Warburg Institute]].<ref>Santiago Fern\u00e1ndez Mosquera, \"El significado de las primeras fiestas cortesanas de Calder\u00f3n,\" ''Calder\u00f3n y el pensamiento ideol\u00f3gico y cultural de su \u00e9poca: XIV Coloquio Anglogermano sobre Calder\u00f3n'', eds., Manfred Tietz y Gero Arnscheidt, Stuttgart, Steiner, 2008, p.224.</ref> For example, he interprets the figure of Circe in one of Calderon's plays as critiquing the policies of [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]]'s minister, the Count-Duke of Olivares.<ref>Margaret Rich Greer, ''The Play of Power. Mythological Court Dramas of Calder\u00f3n de la Barca.''Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1991, pp. 88ff.</ref> On the other hand, [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]] is in many cases a figure that serves to praise the regime. His interest in Golden Age Theater has led him to publish several book collections: ''The Prince in the Tower: Perceptions of \"La vida es sue\u00f1o\"'' (1993), ''Heavenly Bodies: The Realms of \"La estrella de Sevilla\"'' (1996) and ''A Star-Crossed Golden Age: Myth and the Spanish Comedia'' (1998).\n\nOne of his main interests throughout his career has been the relationship between the verbal and the visual in early modern Spanish literature and Italian art. In recent years, this subject has become central to his research, as evinced by the book, ''Cervantes, Raphael and the Classics'' (Cambridge, 1998).  This study focuses on [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes\u2019]] most famous tragedy, ''[[The Siege of Numantia|La Numancia]]'', showing how it is engaged in a conversation with classical authors of Greece and Rome, especially through the interpretations of antiquity presented by the artist [[Raphael]]. This book was followed by the collections ''Writing for the Eyes in the Spanish Golden Age'' (2004) and ''Ekphrasis in the Age of Cervantes'' (2005). In the introduction to this last collection he establishes a typology of [[ekphrasis]], including definitions for allusive, collectionist, descriptive, dramatic, interpolated, narrative, shaping, and veiled ekphrasis, as well as meta-ekphrasis and ur-ekphrasis. He applies these terms in his book: ''Quixotic Frescoes. Cervantes and Italian Art'' (Toronto, 2006).\n\nAfter his book on Cervantes and Italian art, he co-edited two collections on Spanish Golden Age theater. The first one, on tragedy, is entitled ''Hacia la tragedia: Lecturas para un nuevo milenio'' (Madrid, 2008); and the second one, on a specific writer is called ''Calder\u00f3n: del manuscrito a la escena'' (2011). At the same time, he continues to work on Cervantes, having published an edited volume, ''Ovid in the Age of Cervantes'' (2010). His latest book, ''Don Quixote among the Saracens: Clashes of Civilizations and Literary Genres'' (2011) has received the American Publishers' Association PROSE Award in Literature, Honorable Mention (2011).<ref>https://proseawards.com/winners/2011-award-winners/</ref> The book has a double focus. The first has to do with a [[clash of civilizations]] and asks: Why is [[Don Quixote]] at peace among the Saracens? The second has to do with Don Quixote as an \"imperial\" vehicle for the assimilation or destruction of literary genres.\n\nStarting around 2008 De Armas became increasingly interested in the cultural and literary productions of the maternal side of his family, publishing essays on  Ana Gald\u00f3s, Domingo A. Gald\u00f3s and [[Benito P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s]].<ref>Frederick A. de Armas, \u201cUna conversaci\u00f3n trasatl\u00e1ntica: P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s y el cubano Domingo A.

His novel, ''El abra del Yumuri'', takes place in Cuba during the last three months of 1958, just before the fall of [[Fulgencio Batista]] and the triumph of the [[Cuban Revolution]]. It focuses on the lives of five women, most of them from the upper bourgeoisie, and how they deal with political and social upheaval, as well as the dangers of a serial killer that preys on women of means. For some critics, the novel combines two very different trends: that of the social novel inspired by [[Benito P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s]], and that of [[magic realism]] embodied by [[Alejo Carpentier]].<ref>Jose Mar\u00eda Pozuelo Yvancos, \"El abra del Yumuri: La Habana antes del fin,\" ''ABC Cultural'', enero 2017.  http://www.abc.es/cultura/cultural/abci-abra-yumuri-habana-antes-201701130220_noticia.html</ref> His second novel ''Sinfon\u00eda Salvaje'', includes some of the same women that appeared in his first, but, set in the last half of 1959, these characters are now concerned with social and political changes due to the revolution. These changes are embodied in a [[transvestite]] and in the belief that some revolutionaries look like wolves, thus espousing the belief in the [[werewolf]]  <ref>https://www.viceversa-mag.com/para-leer-sinfonia-salvaje-de-frederick-a-de-armas/</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''The Four Interpolated Stories in the Roman Comique'' (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1971).\n* ''Paul Scarron'' (New York: Twayne Books, 1972).\n* ''The Invisible Mistress: Aspects of Feminism and Fantasy in the Golden Age'' (Charlottesville: Biblioteca Siglo de Oro, 1976).\n* ''The Return of Astraea: An Astral-Imperial Myth in Calder\u00f3n'' (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 1986).\n* ''The Prince in the Tower: Perceptions of \"La vida es sue\u00f1o\"'' (Lewisburg: Bucknell University Press, 1993).\n* ''Heavenly Bodies: The Realms of \"La estrella de Sevilla\"'' (Lewisburg: Bucknell University Press, 1996).\n* ''A Star-Crossed Golden Age: Myth and the Spanish Comedia'' (Lewisburg: Bucknell University Press, 1998).\n* ''Cervantes, Raphael and the Classics'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998).\n* ''European Literary Careers: The Author from Antiquity to the Renaissance'' (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2002).

It was also a continuation of the broader trend of Islamic revival in India in the wake of the collapse of [[Mughal Empire|Muslim political hegemony]] to the [[Maratha Empire]] and the subsequent consolidation of the [[British raj]].\n\nThe emergence of Tablighi Jamaat also coincided closely with the rise of various Hindu revivalist movements such as ''[[Shuddhi]]'' (purification) and ''Sanghatan'' (consolidation) launched in the early twentieth century to reconvert Hindus who had converted to Islam and Christianity.<ref name=\"Ballard 1994 64\">{{harvnb|Ballard|1994|p=64}}</ref>\n\n===Origin===\nMuhammad Ilyas, the founder of Tablighi Jamaat, wanted to create a movement that would enjoin good and forbid evil as the [[Quran]] decreed,<ref name=\"Quran\">{{cite quran|3|104 |s=ns}}</ref><ref name=p65/> as his teacher [[Rasheed Ahmad Gangohi]] dreamed of doing.<ref>{{harvnb|Masud|2000|p=xiii}}</ref> The inspiration for this came during his second [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]] in 1926.<ref name='Agwani'>{{Cite book |last=Agwani |first=Mohammad Shafi |year=1986 |title=Islamic Fundamentalism in India |publisher=Twenty First Century Indian Society |page=41 |ref=harv }}</ref> What he lacked in scholarly learning, presence, charisma or speaking ability, he made up for in zeal.<ref name=AMFO1994:513>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=513}}</ref> He initially tried to establish a network of mosque-based religious schools to educate the [[Mewati]] Muslims about Islamic beliefs and practices.

This was different from the other Islamic movements which were mainly [[ulama]]-led and extended their leadership roles to the religious scholars.

Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first ''jamaat'' of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi.<ref name=womenbm/> Accompanied by a close male relative, (''[[mahram]]'', \u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645), women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands.<ref name=daily/><ref name=womenbm/> ''Jamaats'' of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nIn many modern Islamist movements, women have been relegated to a domestic role.{{fact|date=April 2020}} Tablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook during the course of ''da'wa'' tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household.<ref name=womenbm/> Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement,<ref name=daily/> but their opinions are taken into due considerations. Women and the family members are being to told to learn Quran and follow 5 Amaals in every day life, Taleem of Ahadees, Quran recitation,6 Points muzakera, and mashwara for daily life work and fikr for the whole world as people from around the world will be coming and they are the one who has to learn before they teach.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\n==Controversies==\n[[File:Cot Goh.jpg|thumb|Mushawara after Bayan Subh at Tablighi Jamaat center in Cot Goh, [[Montasik]], [[Aceh Besar]], [[Aceh]]]]\n\n===Criticism===\nDue to the orthodox nature of Tablighi Jamaat, they have been criticised for being retrogressive. The women in the movement observe complete [[hijab]] for which the Tablighi Jamaat is accused of keeping women \"strictly subservient and second string\".<ref name=daily/>\n\nTablighi Jamaat has also been criticised within Islamic circles and the major opposition in the Indian subcontinent comes from the [[Barelvi]] movement. One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on ''da'wa'' tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nMany critics, especially those from [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]], criticise Tabligh Jamaat for their neutral political stance. They say that Islamist forces, during their conflicts with secular or non-Islamist opponents, could have been helped by Tablighi Jamaat followers. Specifically they criticise the Tabligh Jamaat's neutral position towards issues in South Asia such as the introduction of an [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|Islamic constitution in Pakistan]] (1950s), Islam vs Socialism (1969\u20131971), communal riots in India in the 1970s and 1980s, the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement (1974), and [[Tehreek Nizam-e-Mustafa|Nizam-e-Mustafa Movement]] (1977).<ref name=AMFO1994:518>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=518}}</ref> The Tablighi Jamaat, in response, states that it is only by avoiding the political debates that the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jamestown.org/program/growing-islamic-state-influence-in-pakistan-fuels-sectarian-violence/|title=Growing Islamic State Influence in Pakistan Fuels Sectarian Violence|website=Jamestown|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref><ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements.

Some scholars objected to the participation of women, but Muhammad Ilyas slowly gained their support and the first ''jamaat'' of women was formed in Nizamuddin, Delhi.<ref name=womenbm/> Accompanied by a close male relative, (''[[mahram]]'', \u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645), women are encouraged to go out in jamaats and work among other women and family members while following the rules of modesty, seclusion and segregation. They observe strict rules of hijab by covering their faces and hands.<ref name=daily/><ref name=womenbm/> ''Jamaats'' of women sometimes participate in large annual meetings; otherwise, they commonly hold neighbourhood meetings. Since South Asian Islamic culture discourages women from going to the mosque and saintly shrines, these venues offer an opportunity for women to pray together and congregate religiously.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nIn many modern Islamist movements, women have been relegated to a domestic role.{{fact|date=April 2020}} Tablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook during the course of ''da'wa'' tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household.<ref name=womenbm/> Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement,<ref name=daily/> but their opinions are taken into due considerations. Women and the family members are being to told to learn Quran and follow 5 Amaals in every day life, Taleem of Ahadees, Quran recitation,6 Points muzakera, and mashwara for daily life work and fikr for the whole world as people from around the world will be coming and they are the one who has to learn before they teach.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\n==Controversies==\n[[File:Cot Goh.jpg|thumb|Mushawara after Bayan Subh at Tablighi Jamaat center in Cot Goh, [[Montasik]], [[Aceh Besar]], [[Aceh]]]]\n\n===Criticism===\nDue to the orthodox nature of Tablighi Jamaat, they have been criticised for being retrogressive. The women in the movement observe complete [[hijab]] for which the Tablighi Jamaat is accused of keeping women \"strictly subservient and second string\".<ref name=daily/>\n\nTablighi Jamaat has also been criticised within Islamic circles and the major opposition in the Indian subcontinent comes from the [[Barelvi]] movement. One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on ''da'wa'' tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that women, like men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.<ref name=womenbm/>\n\nMany critics, especially those from [[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] and [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]], criticise Tabligh Jamaat for their neutral political stance. They say that Islamist forces, during their conflicts with secular or non-Islamist opponents, could have been helped by Tablighi Jamaat followers. Specifically they criticise the Tabligh Jamaat's neutral position towards issues in South Asia such as the introduction of an [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|Islamic constitution in Pakistan]] (1950s), Islam vs Socialism (1969\u20131971), communal riots in India in the 1970s and 1980s, the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement (1974), and [[Tehreek Nizam-e-Mustafa|Nizam-e-Mustafa Movement]] (1977).<ref name=AMFO1994:518>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=518}}</ref> The Tablighi Jamaat, in response, states that it is only by avoiding the political debates that the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jamestown.org/program/growing-islamic-state-influence-in-pakistan-fuels-sectarian-violence/|title=Growing Islamic State Influence in Pakistan Fuels Sectarian Violence|website=Jamestown|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref><ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement for the establishment of an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order.<ref name=AMFO1994:519>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=519}}</ref> The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals. They insist that nations and social systems exist by the virtue of the individuals who form them; therefore, the reform must begin at the grass-roots with individuals and not at the higher level of political structure.<ref name=AMFO1994:517>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=517}}</ref>\n\nTJ have also been accused of insufficient orthodoxy and association with [[Sufism|Sufis]].<ref name=FAttatj>{{cite web |title=Fadhaa'il A'maal & the truth about Tableegh Jaam'aat.

However, industry as a whole was in a disorganised and seriously run-down state after the challenges of the war years, and new vessels could not be built in time for the tourist influx of 1919.\n\nThe Company compromised. Starting with the purchase of {{SS|Mona|1907|2}}, they set about redressing their wartime losses, which also saw the purchase of ''Onward'' forming part of this policy. The vessel is the only Steam Packet Company ship to carry the [[Flag of the Isle of Man|Manx flag]] down the [[River Thames]], for she was transferred to the Company when berthed at Union Dock, [[Limehouse Basin|Limehouse]], in the [[Port of London]].\n\n''Onward'' commenced Steam Packet service still under her original name, until 27 August 1920, when she was renamed ''Mona's Isle.''\n\n''Mona's Isle'' saw service to the various ports then served by the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, but was mainly used on summer work between [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]] and the company's [[Ireland|Irish]] services to [[Belfast]] and [[Dublin]]\n\nOn Monday, 29 June 1936, she struck the [[Howth Head|Devil's Rock in Balscadden Bay]], but was able to reach [[Dublin Port|Dublin]] safely.\nShe was taking on water and could not complete the return journey until repaired.\n\n===Second World War===\nThe ''Mona's Isle'' was considered an old ship, being 34 years old when war broke out in 1939. Like other Steam Packet ships, she was fitted out as an ABV \u2013 an [[Ocean boarding vessel|Armed Boarding Vessel]] \u2013 and for the first few months of the war her life was largely uneventful. This was set to change, as with the plight of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] becoming all too apparent, ''Mona's Isle'' joined no less than seven of her Steam Packet sisters, and made passage to [[Dunkirk]].\n\nAccording to [[Admiralty]] records, ''Mona's Isle'' was the first ship to leave [[Dover]] for [[Dunkirk]]<ref name=\"dynamo\">{{cite web| url=http://dkepaves.free.fr/download/operation%20_dynamo.pdf| title=Operation Dynamo \u2013 The Mass Evacuation from Dunkirk| publisher=Alan L.Putland| format=PDF| accessdate=29 August 2013}}</ref> when [[Dunkirk evacuation|Operation Dynamo]] began, although an exception being [[HMS Wolsey|HMS ''Wolsey'']], a destroyer which was to act as a radio link ship.\n\n''Mona's Isle'' departed Dover at [[24-hour clock|21:00hrs]] on 27 May 1940.<ref name=\"dynamo\"/> The journey across the [[Strait of Dover|Channel]] during the hours of darkness was uneventful, and she arrived at Dunkirk at approximately [[24-hour clock|midnight.]] Once secured at the [[Wharf|quayside]], ''Mona's Isle'' embarked 1,420 troops<ref name=\"dynamo\"/> and she left at first light the next morning.\n\n[[File:Dunkirk Evacuation shipping routes.png|thumb|Map of the three evacuation routes]]Three routes were allocated to the evacuating vessels.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/operation_dynamo.html| title=Operation Dynamo, the evacuation from Dunkirk, 27 May-4 June 1940| author=Rickard, J| date=16 February 2008| publisher=Military History Encyclopedia on the Web| accessdate=29 August 2013}}</ref> The shortest was '''Route Z''', a distance of 39 [[nautical miles]], which, after leaving Dunkirk followed the [[English Channel|French coast]] as far as No.6 Buoy, then turning [[Bearing (navigation)|Nor'west]] on a direct line to [[Dover]].

The third, and although the safest from the German shore batteries, was through a heavily mined portion of the [[English Channel]]. This was '''Route X''', a distance of 55 nautical miles, and ships headed due north out of Dunkirk, through the Ruytingen Pass<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UqEOScq-AjUC&pg=PA20&lpg=PA20&dq=Ruytingen+Pass&source=bl&ots=oCbRTLPOVS&sig=5hXX8eyaoX0F0j_mlBqMdGi50nA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=EPV3Ud6zGYHkOrWggYgG&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Ruytingen%20Pass&f=false| title=The Evacuation from Dunkirk| author=W.

The combination of the minefields and sandbanks meant passage via Route X was confined to daylight hours only.\n\nReturning by Route Z, the ''Mona's Isle'' came under fire from German shore batteries from the French coast. Many shells exploded close to the ship sending plumes of white water into the air and with water spraying over the decks. A number of shells failed to explode as they hit the ship, but one fell aft and smashed the rudder. The ''Mona's Isle'' was a triple screw vessel, so by careful use of port and starboard engines, the ship was able to reach the safety of Dover, but not before a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Bf 109]] had strafed the ship a couple of times killing 23 and wounding 60 others. Using the same route, two coasters, the ''Sequacity'' and the ''Yewdale'' headed for Dunkirk, and along the French coast they both came in for the same treatment. ''Sequacity'' suffered two direct hits, one into her starboard side, the other into the engine room and she started to sink, the crew being rescued by the ''Yewdale'', which aborted the mission and returned to [[Dover]].\n\nHowever ''Mona's Isle'' reached Dover safely, escorted by the [[Destroyer escort|destroyer]] [[HMS Windsor (D42)|HMS ''Windsor'']].\nThe mission had taken nearly 15 hours and she was recorded as the first ship to complete a round trip during the evacuation.<ref name=\"dynamo\"/>\n\nTwo awards were later made to members of the [[ship's company]] or their part in the action. The Commanding Officer, [[Commander|Cdr]] [[John Dowding (naval officer)|J.C.K. Dowding]] [[Royal Naval Reserve|RNR]], received the [[Distinguished Service Order]]. [[Petty Officer]] L.B. Kearley-Pope, [[Royal Naval Reserve|RNR]], was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Medal]]. He had remained at a 12-pounder gun despite multiple wounds and he took a great risk in coming out of cover to close the [[cordite]] boxes. There were casualties among the gun's crew, but the PO continued to carry out his duties until the ship berthed six hours later. Cdr Dowding was later promoted to [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]]. He was [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] of the ill-fated [[Convoy PQ 17]] to Russia, which was forced to scatter and suffered heavy losses in July 1942.\n\n''Mona's Isle'' made a second round trip to Dunkirk, bringing out a further 1,200 troops, and bringing her total to 2,634. The rest of her war service was spent either as an [[Ocean boarding vessel|Armoured Boarding Vessel]] or an accommodation ship. She was transferred to the [[River Tyne|Tyne]] in 1941, where she was three times involved in collisions, one of which did extensive damage and sent her to [[Drydock|dock]] for three months.\n\nOnce on the Tyne, where she lent support to the [[Anti-aircraft warfare|AA]] defences of coastal convoys, ''Mona's Isle'' gave valuable assistance on two occasions to [[Cargo ship|merchantmen]] that had been bombed, in one case rescuing 32 survivors. After [[D-Day]] she worked on cross-Channel transport duties until June 1945, when she was then chartered by the Ministry of War Transport before she was finally released from her war service in March 1946.\n\n===Post-war===\nAfter her war service, ''Mona's Isle'' returned to her duties within the Steam Packet fleet. She worked for a further two years, until with the introduction of the [[Isle of Man Steam Packet Company#The \"Six Sisters\"|\"Six Sisters\"]], she was withdrawn from service.\n\nAfter a thoroughly eventful life spanning 43 years, ''Mona's Isle'' was broken up at [[Milford Haven]] in 1948.\n\n==Gallery==\n\n{{gallery\n|title= RMS ''Mona's Isle''\n|width=250 | height=170 | lines=3\n|align=centre\n|image:Mona's Isle in the Mersey..JPG|''Mona's Isle'' in the [[River Mersey|Mersey]]\n|image:Mona's Isle enters Douglas Harbour..JPG|''Mona's Isle'' enters [[Douglas Harbour]]\n|image:Mona's Isle and Victoria.jpg|[[SS Victoria (1907)|''Victoria'']] (left) and ''Mona's Isle'' (right), during their winter lay-up at the Tongue, [[Douglas, Isle of Man]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n'''Bibliography'''\n{{refbegin}}\n* Chappell, Connery (1980).

Primarily, she was used as a troop transport ship for the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]], on her regular route between [[Folkestone]] and [[Boulogne]].\n\nOn 24 September 1918, she caught fire in [[Folkestone Harbour]]. The fire took hold, and was only contained by the opening of her [[seacock]]s in order to prevent the pier catching fire.<ref name=\"theremembranceline.org.uk\">{{cite web| url=http://www.theremembranceline.org.uk/past_trains.htm| title=The Trains| publisher=The Remembrance Line| accessdate=1 September 2013}}</ref> This resulted in the [[scuttling]] of the vessel; she turned over onto her port side, and was subsequently hauled upright by a team of five steam locomotives in harness.<ref name=\"theremembranceline.org.uk\"/><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.warrenpress.net/FolkestoneThenNow/FolkestoneFerries.html| title=The Ferries| publisher=Folkestone Then and Now| accessdate=29 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Onward scuttled at Folkestone Harbour..JPG|thumb|left|An aerial view of ''Onward'' lying on her [[Port and starboard|portside]], after being [[Scuttling|scuttled]] in [[Folkestone Harbour]], September, 1918. Note the [[Dazzle camouflage|dazzle camouflage paint scheme]], said to provide a degree of protection against U-boat attacks.]]\n\nThe hull of ''Onward'' was purchased by the [[Isle of Man Steam Packet Company]] in 1920 and rebuilt as ''Mona's Isle'',<ref name=\"simpleon\"/> the fourth ship in the company's history to be so named.\n\n===Isle of Man Steam Packet Company===\nOf eleven Steam Packet ships either purchased or chartered by the [[Admiralty]] during the [[Great War]], only four returned to service with the Company after the cessation of hostilities, and consequently, new ships were going to be needed to handle the resumption of peacetime traffic. However, industry as a whole was in a disorganised and seriously run-down state after the challenges of the war years, and new vessels could not be built in time for the tourist influx of 1919.\n\nThe Company compromised. Starting with the purchase of {{SS|Mona|1907|2}}, they set about redressing their wartime losses, which also saw the purchase of ''Onward'' forming part of this policy. The vessel is the only Steam Packet Company ship to carry the [[Flag of the Isle of Man|Manx flag]] down the [[River Thames]], for she was transferred to the Company when berthed at Union Dock, [[Limehouse Basin|Limehouse]], in the [[Port of London]].\n\n''Onward'' commenced Steam Packet service still under her original name, until 27 August 1920, when she was renamed ''Mona's Isle.''\n\n''Mona's Isle'' saw service to the various ports then served by the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, but was mainly used on summer work between [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]] and the company's [[Ireland|Irish]] services to [[Belfast]] and [[Dublin]]\n\nOn Monday, 29 June 1936, she struck the [[Howth Head|Devil's Rock in Balscadden Bay]], but was able to reach [[Dublin Port|Dublin]] safely.\nShe was taking on water and could not complete the return journey until repaired.\n\n===Second World War===\nThe ''Mona's Isle'' was considered an old ship, being 34 years old when war broke out in 1939. Like other Steam Packet ships, she was fitted out as an ABV \u2013 an [[Ocean boarding vessel|Armed Boarding Vessel]] \u2013 and for the first few months of the war her life was largely uneventful. This was set to change, as with the plight of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] becoming all too apparent, ''Mona's Isle'' joined no less than seven of her Steam Packet sisters, and made passage to [[Dunkirk]].\n\nAccording to [[Admiralty]] records, ''Mona's Isle'' was the first ship to leave [[Dover]] for [[Dunkirk]]<ref name=\"dynamo\">{{cite web| url=http://dkepaves.free.fr/download/operation%20_dynamo.pdf| title=Operation Dynamo \u2013 The Mass Evacuation from Dunkirk| publisher=Alan L.Putland| format=PDF| accessdate=29 August 2013}}</ref> when [[Dunkirk evacuation|Operation Dynamo]] began, although an exception being [[HMS Wolsey|HMS ''Wolsey'']], a destroyer which was to act as a radio link ship.\n\n''Mona's Isle'' departed Dover at [[24-hour clock|21:00hrs]] on 27 May 1940.<ref name=\"dynamo\"/> The journey across the [[Strait of Dover|Channel]] during the hours of darkness was uneventful, and she arrived at Dunkirk at approximately [[24-hour clock|midnight.]] Once secured at the [[Wharf|quayside]], ''Mona's Isle'' embarked 1,420 troops<ref name=\"dynamo\"/> and she left at first light the next morning.\n\n[[File:Dunkirk Evacuation shipping routes.png|thumb|Map of the three evacuation routes]]Three routes were allocated to the evacuating vessels.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/operation_dynamo.html| title=Operation Dynamo, the evacuation from Dunkirk, 27 May-4 June 1940| author=Rickard, J| date=16 February 2008| publisher=Military History Encyclopedia on the Web| accessdate=29 August 2013}}</ref> The shortest was '''Route Z''', a distance of 39 [[nautical miles]], which, after leaving Dunkirk followed the [[English Channel|French coast]] as far as No.6 Buoy, then turning [[Bearing (navigation)|Nor'west]] on a direct line to [[Dover]].

The third, and although the safest from the German shore batteries, was through a heavily mined portion of the [[English Channel]]. This was '''Route X''', a distance of 55 nautical miles, and ships headed due north out of Dunkirk, through the Ruytingen Pass<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UqEOScq-AjUC&pg=PA20&lpg=PA20&dq=Ruytingen+Pass&source=bl&ots=oCbRTLPOVS&sig=5hXX8eyaoX0F0j_mlBqMdGi50nA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=EPV3Ud6zGYHkOrWggYgG&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Ruytingen%20Pass&f=false| title=The Evacuation from Dunkirk| author=W.

The combination of the minefields and sandbanks meant passage via Route X was confined to daylight hours only.\n\nReturning by Route Z, the ''Mona's Isle'' came under fire from German shore batteries from the French coast. Many shells exploded close to the ship sending plumes of white water into the air and with water spraying over the decks. A number of shells failed to explode as they hit the ship, but one fell aft and smashed the rudder. The ''Mona's Isle'' was a triple screw vessel, so by careful use of port and starboard engines, the ship was able to reach the safety of Dover, but not before a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Bf 109]] had strafed the ship a couple of times killing 23 and wounding 60 others. Using the same route, two coasters, the ''Sequacity'' and the ''Yewdale'' headed for Dunkirk, and along the French coast they both came in for the same treatment. ''Sequacity'' suffered two direct hits, one into her starboard side, the other into the engine room and she started to sink, the crew being rescued by the ''Yewdale'', which aborted the mission and returned to [[Dover]].\n\nHowever ''Mona's Isle'' reached Dover safely, escorted by the [[Destroyer escort|destroyer]] [[HMS Windsor (D42)|HMS ''Windsor'']].\nThe mission had taken nearly 15 hours and she was recorded as the first ship to complete a round trip during the evacuation.<ref name=\"dynamo\"/>\n\nTwo awards were later made to members of the [[ship's company]] or their part in the action. The Commanding Officer, [[Commander|Cdr]] [[John Dowding (naval officer)|J.C.K. Dowding]] [[Royal Naval Reserve|RNR]], received the [[Distinguished Service Order]]. [[Petty Officer]] L.B. Kearley-Pope, [[Royal Naval Reserve|RNR]], was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Medal]]. He had remained at a 12-pounder gun despite multiple wounds and he took a great risk in coming out of cover to close the [[cordite]] boxes. There were casualties among the gun's crew, but the PO continued to carry out his duties until the ship berthed six hours later. Cdr Dowding was later promoted to [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]]. He was [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] of the ill-fated [[Convoy PQ 17]] to Russia, which was forced to scatter and suffered heavy losses in July 1942.\n\n''Mona's Isle'' made a second round trip to Dunkirk, bringing out a further 1,200 troops, and bringing her total to 2,634. The rest of her war service was spent either as an [[Ocean boarding vessel|Armoured Boarding Vessel]] or an accommodation ship. She was transferred to the [[River Tyne|Tyne]] in 1941, where she was three times involved in collisions, one of which did extensive damage and sent her to [[Drydock|dock]] for three months.\n\nOnce on the Tyne, where she lent support to the [[Anti-aircraft warfare|AA]] defences of coastal convoys, ''Mona's Isle'' gave valuable assistance on two occasions to [[Cargo ship|merchantmen]] that had been bombed, in one case rescuing 32 survivors. After [[D-Day]] she worked on cross-Channel transport duties until June 1945, when she was then chartered by the Ministry of War Transport before she was finally released from her war service in March 1946.\n\n===Post-war===\nAfter her war service, ''Mona's Isle'' returned to her duties within the Steam Packet fleet. She worked for a further two years, until with the introduction of the [[Isle of Man Steam Packet Company#The \"Six Sisters\"|\"Six Sisters\"]], she was withdrawn from service.\n\nAfter a thoroughly eventful life spanning 43 years, ''Mona's Isle'' was broken up at [[Milford Haven]] in 1948.\n\n==Gallery==\n\n{{gallery\n|title= RMS ''Mona's Isle''\n|width=250 | height=170 | lines=3\n|align=centre\n|image:Mona's Isle in the Mersey..JPG|''Mona's Isle'' in the [[River Mersey|Mersey]]\n|image:Mona's Isle enters Douglas Harbour..JPG|''Mona's Isle'' enters [[Douglas Harbour]]\n|image:Mona's Isle and Victoria.jpg|[[SS Victoria (1907)|''Victoria'']] (left) and ''Mona's Isle'' (right), during their winter lay-up at the Tongue, [[Douglas, Isle of Man]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n'''Bibliography'''\n{{refbegin}}\n* Chappell, Connery (1980).
