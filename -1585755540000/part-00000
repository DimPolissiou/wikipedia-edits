Cornwall is Ontario's easternmost city, located on the [[Saint Lawrence River]] in the [[Quebec City\u2013Windsor Corridor]] along [[Ontario Highway 401]], and is the [[urban area|urban]] centre for surrounding communities, including [[South Stormont|Long Sault]] and Ingleside to the west, [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] Territory of [[Akwesasne]] to the south, St. Andrew's and Avonmore to the north, and Glen Walter, Martintown, Apple Hill, Williamstown, and Lancaster to the east.\n\nCornwall lies on the [[45th parallel north|45th parallel]], approximately {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} southeast of [[Ottawa]],  the national [[Capital (political)|capital]], {{convert|120|km|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Montreal]], Quebec's largest city, and {{convert|440|km|abbr=on}} northeast of Toronto, the provincial capital and Canada's largest city.  It is named after the English [[Duchy of Cornwall]]; the City's [[coat of arms]] is based on that of the duchy with its colours reversed and the addition of a \"royal [[tressure]]\", a Scottish symbol of royalty.\n\nIts largest industries include logistics distribution and call centres.\n\n==Historical overview==\nAboriginal peoples have lived in and around the area of present-day Cornwall for millennia.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThough accounts suggest Europeans filtered into the area and had scattered settlements for some time, the first documented European settlement was established in 1784 by [[United Empire Loyalists]], primarily from the former British colony of New York.  After the war for American independence, former colonial soldiers loyal to the Crown and other disbanded soldiers and their families began to settle at the site of Cornwall, then called New Johnstown.<ref name=\"heritagefdn.on.ca\">{{cite web |url=https://www.heritagetrust.on.ca/en/plaques/founding-of-cornwall |title=Founding of Cornwall, The |accessdate=January 17, 2019 |publisher=Ontario Heritage Trust }}</ref> Many of the new arrivals were of German origin, with the town being named for [[Johnstown, New York]] where many came from.\n\nThe main group were led by Lieutenant-Colonel Sir John Johnson and were soldiers from the First Battalion King's Royal Regiment of New York and a contingent of the 84th Royal Highland Emigrants.  Following the success of rebellious colonists in the [[American Revolution]], many of those on afraid for their lives or uncomfortable in the newly independent United States would become \"United Empire Loyalists\", as they were later called, and migrated to Canada.  The British government helped them settle throughout the Canadas as a reward for their loyalty and to compensate them for their losses in the United States. One of the chief settlement regions was the St Lawrence River valley, from Kingston to Cornwall, which would later be known as \"loyalist country\".\n\nThey founded a settlement on the site formerly called ''Pointe Maligne'' by French colonists and renamed it \"Royal Settlement #2\", and, later, \"New Johnstown\".  It was later renamed Cornwall by the British for the [[Duke of Cornwall]] by proclamation of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince George]], and in 1834 the town became one of the first incorporated municipalities in the British colony of [[Upper Canada]].<ref>[http://fotw.fivestarflags.com/ca-on-co.html 5 Star Flags]</ref>  The construction of the [[Cornwall Canal]] between 1834 and 1842 accelerated the community's development into a regional and industrial economic \"capital\" for a growing hinterland of towns and villages.<ref name=\"heritagefdn.on.ca\"/><ref name=\"ParhamGreatWilderness\">{{cite book|last1=Parham|first1=Claire Puccia|title=From Great Wilderness to Seaway Towns: A Comparative History of Cornwall, Ontario, and Massena, New York, 1784-2001|date=2013|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=0791485676|page=46}}</ref>\n\nIn 1846, the population was about 1,600 and there were many brick and stone houses as well as a stone courthouse and jail. Several government offices were located here. There was little industry, except for a foundry and two tanneries, but many independent tradesmen of various types worked there. Other amenities included two bank agencies, eight taverns and a ladies' school.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm.

Railway connections, beginning in the 1850s, provided connections between Cornwall and local communities that required access to public services in Cornwall itself, such as high schools and medical services, and helped cement Cornwall's position as a regional centre for a large, rapidly expanding and increasingly populated rural hinterland .<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lostvillages.ca/history/the-lost-villages/mille-roches/ |title=Mille Roches |publisher=The Lost Villages Historical Society |accessdate=January 17, 2019}}</ref> The network of villages and towns surrounding Cornwall helped make the city a local entrepot for business, commerce, media and services.\n\nIn 1944, the city was rocked by the magnitude 5.8 [[1944 Cornwall\u2013Massena earthquake|Cornwall\u2013Massena earthquake]]. There were no deaths or injuries reported, but several chimneys were destroyed or damaged, along with heavy damage to historical masonry structures. For example, the [[Cornwall Collegiate and Vocational School]] received heavy damage from masonry work falling through the roof of the gymnasium.\n\nSituated west of Cornwall along the [[St. Lawrence River]] were several smaller communities.  Now known as [[the Lost Villages]], the communities were permanently flooded in 1958 during the construction of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] as the massive [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] at the western end of the city required a reservoir. The villages were flooded when it was filled. Much of the Cornwall region's local character also changed at this time.\n\n==Ethnic history==\nEastern Ontario has always been a highway or corridor through which people moved, a corridor used by migration and conquest.  Prior to European colonization, the Mohawks and Six Nations [[Iroquois]] settled, raided and battled through the St. Lawrence valley.<ref>[[Akwesasne#History]]</ref>  The French and British fought over the waterway, often using and being used by native allies in highly complex economic competition. Later, after thirteen of the British colonies declared independence and became the United States, during the [[War of 1812]], it became a battleground between Americans and the people who would become today's Canadians.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.choosecornwall.ca/live-in-cornwall/history/cornwall-and-the-war-of-1812/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819103141/http://www.choosecornwall.ca/live-in-cornwall/history/cornwall-and-the-war-of-1812/ |publisher=Choose Cornwall |title=Cornwall and the War of 1812 |archive-date=August 19, 2016 |url-status=dead |access-date=November 4, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>  Formally founded to be a new home for refugees from the American Revolution, it remained a home for refugees and migrants for much of its history.\n\nEarly settlement of the region is largely undocumented although oral histories and early accounts suggest that European settlers, traders and farmers lived in the area long before formal state recognition, and had been interacting with the native population for most of that time.\n\nThe post-contact regional population was a mixture of [[French Canadian]], [[Ojibwe]] and [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] residents.  To this mix was added an influx of American English Loyalists and refugees from the [[Thirteen Colonies]] (now the United States), other French Canadian and [[Acadian]] migrants and, later, poor Scottish and Irish immigrants and refugees who arrived from overseas and from other parts of Canada.  These different groups mixed and integrated over time, with family names and histories reflecting a blending of different backgrounds that became typical of Eastern Ontario.<ref name=\"sunypress.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sunypress.edu/pdf/60871.pdf |publisher=[[SUNY Press]] |title=The  Early  Settlement  of  Cornwall, Ontario  and  Massena,  New  York, 1784\u20131834 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611191042/http://www.sunypress.edu/pdf/60871.pdf |archive-date=June 11, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ontarioarchaeology.on.ca/summary/english.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308062404/http://www.ontarioarchaeology.on.ca/summary/english.htm |publisher=Ontario Archaeology Society |title=The English Period (A.D. 1760 to 1867) |archive-date=March 8, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nSmaller but nevertheless impressive contributions in the region were made by a host of other migrants, from Jewish traders, craftsmen and merchants, to Eastern European refugees and even a significant body of former slaves.

Most of these former slaves settled and integrated into the same communities where they were freed.  By 1833, this process of liberation had succeeded throughout the Empire and all slaves in the British Empire were free. The British Empire was the first major state in world history to abolish slavery, and Ontario was the place where this process first bore fruit.

In the aftermath of the American Revolution, the British authorities split the [[Province of Canada]] in 1791 into two, Upper Canada for English settlers fleeing persecution in the United States and Lower Canada for the French (later, Ontario and Quebec). This was designed to accommodate Loyalists who had fled post-war reprisals and persecution in the new United States, though the 5,000 English-speaking settlers in the Eastern Township of Quebec were allowed to stay in the French-speaking area and many French settlers moved into Ontario. Along with the area's original inhabitants, this made the area a patchwork of intersecting ethnicities that would end up blending to a great degree.  Cornwall and the surrounding area, originally called \"Royal Settlement #2\" and then \"New Jamestown\", was initially a rough place and was largely left to its own devices.  According to contemporary reports, this bred a local culture of intense self-reliance.  Adding to this initial history of pragmatic entrepreneurialism, beginning very early with the founding of the city, provincial and federal governments have typically neglected the area, treating it as little more than a transit corridor. Those who remained in the region tended to be those who had the fortitude and energy to survive on their own, with little outside assistance.\n\n\"The original 516 settlers arrived in Royal Township #2 with minimal supplies and faced years of hard work and possible starvation.  Upon their departure from military camps in Montreal, Pointe Claire, Saint Anne, and Lachine in the fall of 1784, Loyalists were given a tent, one month's worth of food rations, clothes, and agricultural provisions by regiment commanders.  They were promised one cow for every two families, an axe, and other necessary tools in the near future. For the next three years, bateaux (boat) crews delivered rations to the township, after which residents were left to fend for themselves.\"<ref name=\"sunypress.edu\"/>\n\nThe region's energetic spirit of enterprise and fortitude was well known in the 19th century.  [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]], the Welsh-Canadian explorer who mapped the Far West and was called the greatest land geographer in history, drew many of his traveling companions from Cornwall's rural hinterland, drawing on Scottish and native settlers, and himself lived in Williamstown.<ref>[[David Thompson (explorer)]]</ref>\n\nMore recently, Cornwall has seen an increase in the arrival of new immigrants,<ref>[http://www.city-data.com/canada/Cornwall-City-citizenship.html  Population, Age characteristics, Dwellings, Houses, Language, Education, Work, Industry, Earnings, Income, Immigration, Citizenship, Labor<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}}</ref> who tend to integrate and often fare better than immigrants in other parts of the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eotb-cfeo.on.ca/english/labour-market/update-on-cornwalls-economy.html |publisher=Eastern Ontario Training Board |title=Update on Cornwall's Economy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813042036/http://www.eotb-cfeo.on.ca/english/labour-market/update-on-cornwalls-economy.html |archive-date=August 13, 2016 |url-status=dead |access-date=November 4, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Historical integration==\nThe Cornwall region was unusually integrated for rural counties in Ontario.  For hundreds of years, the local population has been characterized by a mix of economic migrants, refugees and opportunists.  Mixing of different social classes and ethnic backgrounds was common even early in its history, due to the interdependence demanded by isolation and the lack of either support from or interference by official authorities.\n\nThe original Native population was remarkably welcoming, and the Iroquois were especially well known for integrating newcomers into local societies and for adapting to change as it happened.  Many people in the region have some Native ancestry as a result, and many communities sit on sites that have been occupied, farmed or managed for hundreds of years. While some people were pushed out, others simply blended into new communities in a process that would go on continuously over many generations.\n\nLack of strict hierarchy was a characteristic of the region. For example, during the 1780s\u20131830s, a \"Bee\" was a social event that pooled local labour resources, when people would come together for collective projects or to help out individual families, and was often a festive occasion.  These early \"Bees\" presaged the development of a varied and integrated culture that ultimately drew on many different classes, backgrounds and ethnic and linguistic groups, all of whom were forced by the harsh reality of life in the region to work together for common goals, the primary of which was survival.  These \"Bees\" and different forms of collective, shared labour were extremely common in Eastern Ontario generally, and especially so in the early villages of the St. Lawrence valley.\n\n\"In her book \"Roughing It in the Bush\", Susanna Moodie observed that \"people in the woods, have a craze for giving and going to bees and run to them with as much eagerness as a peasant runs to a race.\" Bees often involved all ranks and nationalities of society.  Thomas Need, a sawmill operator in Victoria County, described in From Great Wilderness to Seaway Towns the raising of his facility in 1834 in the following way:  \"They assembled in great force and all worked together in great harmony and good will not with- standing their different stations in life.\"  These gatherings exhibited the lack of aristocracy in the rural loyalist settlement along the St. Lawrence River and residents' disregard for individuals' former social standing or lineage... The harshness and isolation of frontier living prevented the development of an aristocracy and, instead, united all members of the community in a struggle for survival.  Early Loyalists, regardless of the amount of land they owned, depended upon the help of their neighbors to clear land, build homes, and share supplies and food during times of poor harvests.\"<ref name=\"sunypress.edu\"/>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Historical populations\n|type        = Canada\n|align       = \n|shading     = \n|percentages = \n|footnote    =\n|1986 | 46425\n|1991 | 47137\n|[[Canada 1996 Census|1996]]|47403\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]|45640\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]<ref name=\"cp2006\">{{cite web |title=2006 Community Profiles: Cornwall, Ontario (city) |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/prof/92-591/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3501012&Geo2=PR&Code2=35&Data=Count&SearchText=Cornwall&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=35&B1=All&Custom= |publisher=Statistics Canada |accessdate=January 17, 2019}}</ref>|45965\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]<ref name=\"cp2011\">{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3501012&Geo2=CD&Code2=3501&Data=Count&SearchText=Cornwall&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom=&TABID=1 |title=Cornwall census profile |publisher=Statistics Canada |work=[[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Census of Population]] |accessdate=March 21, 2012}}</ref>|46340\n|[[Canada 2016 Census|2016]]<ref name=\"census2016\"/>|46,589}}\n\nAs of 2016,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3501012&Geo2=PR&Code2=01&SearchText=Canada&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&TABID=1&type=1|title=Census Profile, 2016 Census - Cornwall, City [Census subdivision], Ontario and Canada [Country]|last=Government of Canada|first=Statistics Canada|date=2017-02-08|website=www12.statcan.gc.ca|access-date=2019-07-19}}</ref> Cornwall has a population of 46,589, an increase of 0.5% from 2011.

With the completion of the new low-level bridge connecting Cornwall to Cornwall Island, the C.B.S.A. port was moved to a permanent temporary facility on the canal lands.  The city is connected to the United States at Roosevelttown near the municipalities of [[Massena (village), New York|Massena, New York]] and [[Malone (village), New York|Malone, New York]], via the [[Three Nations Crossing]] (Canada, Mohawk, and United States) which traverses the St. Lawrence River.\n\nCornwall was once home to a thriving [[cotton]] processing industry.  Courtaulds Canada, Inc.'s rayon manufacturing mill operated until 1992; at one point it employed nearly 3,000 people.  [[Domtar Inc.|Domtar]], a Quebec-based company, operated a paper mill in the city for nearly 100 years, ceasing operations on March 31, 2006.  At its peak, Domtar employed nearly 1,500 employees.

Further research, showed that infants under two years of age had four times the expected hospital admission rate for asthma.  Lung and male rectal cancer rates were also elevated in comparison with the rest of the province.\n\nThe shutdown of the Courtaulds rayon fiber operation (1992) and the Domtar paper mill (2006) have been a significant factor in the City's improved air quality.  Cornwall now consistently ranks in the top 10 of 40 monitored communities across Ontario.  More recently, a Pembina Institute study of 29 communities across Ontario looked at a number of environmental, social and economic factors.  Cornwall ranked 13th overall, and its air quality was ranked #1 in the province.\n\nCornwall was at one point one of only two cities left in the Province of Ontario with only primary sewage treatment facilities.  But construction was started in May 2012 on the secondary treatment level plant with the Governments of Canada and Ontario each covering one-third of an estimated $55.5 million construction cost.  The City picked up the remaining one-third of the cost of $18.5 million.  The secondary treatment level plant was completed in November 2014.\n\nIn 2006, the City updated its Strategic Plan, including the objective to develop an environmentally-sustainable community. {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\nIn 2007, a former city councillor, Naresh Bhargava, began working with the St. Lawrence River Institute of Environmental Sciences on a project called the Community Carbon Reduction Initiative.  City Council provided $5,000 in start-up funding for the project.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}  Earlier, progress in energy conservation was made in the 1990s when a co-generation plant went into operation that provides 4% to 6% of the City's daily electrical needs while at the same time heating a number of buildings, including both hospital sites.  Cornwall also converted all of its traffic signals in 2002 to energy efficient LEDs that have reduced power usage by more than 600,000&nbsp;kW\u2014enough to light close to 70 homes.

Crossing.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The north span of the [[Three Nations Crossing]] seen from Cornwall's west end.  This bridge is being torn down as it has been replaced by a much shorter low-level bridge to Cornwall Island.]]\n\n===Rail===\n\nThe [[Grand Trunk Railway]] (now [[CN Rail]]) built an east-west line through Cornwall in 1856, and its original station dated to that year. The [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] (NY&O) followed with a north-south line crossing the St. Lawrence, with a station in Cornwall dating to 1898.<ref name=canada-rail>{{cite web |url=https://www.canada-rail.com/ontario/c2/cornwall.html |title=Railway Stations in Cornwall Ontario |website=Canada-Rail.com |access-date=9 December 2019}}</ref> [[CP Rail|Canadian Pacific]] created a succession of subsidiaries and plans for a Cornwall line starting in the 1880s, culminating in the [[Glengarry and Stormont Railway]] in 1915, which connected to CP's [[Ontario and Quebec Railway]] mainline to the northeast, creating an alternative route to Montr\u00e9al.\n\nThe expansion of the St. Lawrence Seaway in the 1950s significantly disrupted the city's rail infrastructure, resulting in CN relocating its line northward, and the NY&O abandoning its line altogether. A new CN passenger station, which is still in use today by [[Via Rail]], was constructed in 1957 and the century-old Grand Trunk station was demolished shortly after, in 1962. The NY&O's passenger service ended in 1957 and its passenger station was demolished in the 1960s as well.<ref name=canada-rail /> CP passenger service ended even earlier, in 1952, and the CP passenger station was demolished in 1969.<ref name=canada-rail /> CP abandoned the line altogether in 1995.\n\nCurrently, Cornwall only has one significant rail line, the CN Kingston Subdivision, which functions as the CN mainline between Toronto and Montreal. It also serves as a component of Via Rail's [[Qu\u00e9bec City\u2013Windsor Corridor (Via Rail)|Qu\u00e9bec City-Windsor corridor]]. Via Corridor passenger trains between [[Montr\u00e9al]] and [[Toronto]] stop at the [[Cornwall railway station]], which is located in the city's north end. Via's [[Via Rail#High Frequency Rail Project (HFR)|High-Frequency Rail]] (HFR) proposal, which would generally improve passenger rail service in Eastern Ontario, would leave Cornwall unaffected, as most of the service improvements are planned to be focused on new lines constructed on abandoned rail rights of way, as well as existing Via-owned lines such as the Via Brockville Subdivision.\n\n====Street railway====\n\nAround the turn of the 20th century, Cornwall had a burgeoning electric street railway system, which transported freight and passengers throughout the city. The '''[[Cornwall Street Railway|Cornwall Electric Street Railway]]''' began passenger operations in 1896 and freight operations in 1899. Passenger operations ended in 1949 with a switch to [[trolleybus]] service, and electric freight operations ended in 1971 with the system's sale to CN Rail and subsequent [[dieselization]].<ref name=trainweb>{{cite web |url=http://www.trainweb.org/elso/csr-elec.htm |title=Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company |website=Trainweb.org |date=22 October 2009 |accessdate=9 December 2019}}</ref> During its time, the street railway was significant in the city's social and industrial development. Ultimately, its passenger tram service, after conversion to trolleybus, became the present-day Cornwall Transit, which provides municipal diesel bus service to this day.\n\n===Public transit===\n\nWith a fleet of 24 buses, [[Cornwall Transit]] operates 6 days per week (excluding Sundays and holidays) on fixed routes and supplementary rush hour routes.  In addition, there is an on-demand \"Handi-Transit\" service for the disabled.  Cornwall Transit also contracts taxi service at a flat rate for Handi-Transit registrants who are ambulatory.  The City-operated transit system transports approximately 860,000 passengers every year. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwall.ca/en/live-here/cornwall-transit.aspx|title=Cornwall Transit|date=2019-12-17|website=www.cornwall.ca|language=en|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref>\n\n===Air===\n\nCornwall is served by the [[Cornwall Regional Airport]], which is located {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} east of the city near Summerstown. It is open year-round and licensed for day and night VFR IFR operations. The facilities include a {{convert|3500|x|100|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} [[runway]], a [[Airport terminal|terminal]], [[hangar]], and the [[Canada Border Services Agency]] (on request). Domestic and international charter flying service from the airport is offered by Cornwall Aviation.\n\n===Sea===\n\nThe City of Cornwall is on the St. Lawrence Seaway just east of the [[Eisenhower Locks|Eisenhower]] and [[Snell Locks|Snell]] [[Lock (water transport)|Locks]]. The [[Cornwall Harbour and Government wharf]] are located on the north bank of the St. Lawrence River in the city's east end.\n\n==Sports==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2019}}\nCornwall has two indoor arenas, the [[Cornwall Civic Complex]] and the [[Benson Centre]] with three ice surfaces.\n\n'''Hockey'''\n\nCornwall has been home to a variety of sports teams, the most notable of which was the [[Cornwall Royals]] hockey team which played in both the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]] and the [[Ontario Hockey League]] before moving to [[Newmarket, Ontario|Newmarket]] in 1992.  The Royals won the [[Memorial Cup]] in 1972, 1980 and 1981.\n\nBetween the years 1993\u20131996, the [[Cornwall Aces]], an [[American Hockey League|AHL]] franchise, was in town.  They were the farm team for the [[NHL]] franchise the [[Quebec Nordiques]]/[[Colorado Avalanche]].\n\nThe [[Cornwall Colts]] are the current Junior A team playing in the [[Central Canada Hockey League]].  Cornwall has hosted several major sporting events in its history including the Ontario Winter Games and Special Olympics. In 2008, Cornwall hosted the Royal Bank Cup, the National Championship for Junior A hockey teams.  The Cornwall Colts finished third in the series, winning 2 of 5 games.  The Cornwall Colts hosted the Fred Page Cup in 2015 for the Eastern Canadian Championship.  Today, the teams represented in the Fred Page Cup are the Maritime Hockey League Champions (Kent Cup), the Ligue de Hockey Junior AAA du Qu\u00e9bec Champions (Napa Cup), the Ottawa District champions of the Central Canada Hockey League (Bogart-Nielsen Cup), and a host team chosen by committee two years before the tournament.\n\nThe [[Cornwall River Kings]] of the [[Ligue Nord-Am\u00e9ricaine de Hockey]] (LNAH) started playing out of the Civic Complex in the fall of 2012 but folded in 2016. The River Kings were replaced by the [[Cornwall Nationals]] of the [[Federal Hockey League]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.standard-freeholder.com/2016/09/14/cornwall-city-hall-inks-deal-with-fhl-nationals |title=Cornwall city hall inks deal with FHL Nationals |publisher=Standard-Freeholder |date=September 14, 2016 |access-date=September 16, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917084122/http://www.standard-freeholder.com/2016/09/14/cornwall-city-hall-inks-deal-with-fhl-nationals |archive-date=September 17, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> who folded during the 2017\u201318 season.\n\n'''Competitive Swimming'''\n\nCornwall's competitive swim team is the Cornwall Sea Lions, currently under the coaching of Simon St. Pierre. Two swimmers, Hannah Riordan  and Tess Simpson competed at junior international level.  Riordan and Simpson have also represented Canada at the second FINA World Junior Championships the Tri-Nations Cup,{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} and Riordan competed in the Junior Pan Pacifics, and Simpson in the Australian Youth festival. Four swimmers attained scholarships at NCAA schools (Riordan \u2013 Auburn, Simpson \u2013 Texas A&M, Megan Suffel \u2013 University of New Hampshire and Claudia Dugual at Drexal).  These four swimmers all received their fastest club times while under the coaching of Robert Eynon.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n'''Soccer'''\n\nCornwall has three soccer areas, the Kinsmen Junior Soccer Field at Second Street West and Haulage Road; The Benson Centre (for indoor soccer); and Optimist Park on Sunnyside Street and St. Michel Drive.\n\n'''Rugby'''\n\nCornwall has competitive men's and women's rugby clubs.  After many years without rugby in the community, it saw a resurrection in 2006. Both teams compete in the Eastern Ontario Rugby Union which is located in Ottawa.  The home of the Cornwall Crusaders Rugby Football Club is Cornwall Collegiate and Vocational School.  The men's and women's teams practice Tuesdays and Thursdays from April until the end of August.  The men's team has found success in recent{{when|date=January 2019}} years, winning the Eastern Ontario Men's Division 1 Championship in 2009 and 2010 against the Napanee Outlaws and the Gatineau Mirage, respectively.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe sport of rugby continues to grow in the community. Many high schools throughout Stormont, Dundas, and Glengarry have junior and senior boys' teams as well as varsity girls' teams.  These high school teams serve as feeders to the Cornwall Crusaders. Many players who play on the Crusaders today come from high schools in the S.D.& G. area.\n\n'''Roller Derby'''\nThe Seaway Roller Derby Girls Association is the first roller derby flat track roller derby league in Cornwall and SD&G Counties, established in 2011. The Power Dames is the first official team.\n\n'''Girls' basketball'''\nThe United Counties girls' basketball team won provincial and international basketball tournaments in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  In addition, the city offered girls' and women's basketball from age eight to college graduates.  The San Lawrence College women's team won a college tournament as well. The teams were coached by Adelore Bergeon and Alan Haskvitz.\n\n==Notable people==\nSome of the more famous people to hail from the Cornwall area include:\n* [[Barstool Prophets]], three of the four members of the Canadian rock band hailed from Cornwall, where the band had its start (Glenn Forrester, Graham Greer, Bobby Tamas)\n* [[Darby Bergin]], 1st Canadian [[Surgeon General (Canada)|Surgeon General]]\n* [[Malcolm Burn]], musician and record producer\n* [[Doug Carpenter]], former [[NHL]] coach\n* [[Alain Chevrier]], former NHL goaltender\n* [[Corbett Denneny]], former NHL player\n* [[Cy Denneny]], brother of Corbett, former NHL player, in the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]\n* [[Lori Dupuis]], Olympic gold and silver medalist in women's ice hockey\n* [[Jacob Gallinger]], United States politician\n* [[Peter Gatien]], New York nightlife [[impresario]]\n* [[Ryan Gosling]], actor\n* [[Alan Haskvitz]], National Hall of Fame and USA Today All American Educator\n* [[Christina Julien]], current member of the Canadian national women's soccer team\n* [[Chad Kilger]], retired NHL player\n* [[Bob Kilger]], former NHL referee, former mayor, father of Chad Kilger\n* [[Ed Lalonde|Ed \"Newsy\" Lalonde]], captained the [[Montreal Canadiens]] in the 1910s and helped the team win its first [[Stanley Cup]] in 1916\n* [[Donald Alexander Macdonald (general)|Donald Alexander Macdonald]], soldier\n* [[John Sandfield Macdonald]], prominent lawyer and the first Premier of Ontario\n* [[Maggie MacDonald]], playwright and musician\n* [[Don McKay]], Governor General's Award-winning poet and essayist\n* [[Duncan McNaughton]], gold medalist in the 1932 Olympics in the high jump\n* [[Ray Miron]], hockey player, coach, and executive, inducted into Cornwall Sports Hall of Fame\n* [[Scott Pearson]], former NHL player, drafted 6th overall to the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] in 1988\n* [[Nathan Phillips (politician)|Nathan Phillips]], Toronto mayor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontariojewisharchives.org/exhibits/osjc/communities/cornwall/earlycommunity/index.html|title=Ontario Jewish Communities {{!}} Cornwall - First Jewish Settlers|website=www.ontariojewisharchives.org|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref>\n* [[George Beverly Shea]], noted gospel singer, associated with Billy Graham crusades\n* [[John Strachan]], 19th-century Anglican priest and influential Bishop of Toronto\n* [[Orval Tessier]], former [[NHL]] player, coach of the Chicago Blackhawks and scout\n* Colonel The Hon.

After the war for American independence, former colonial soldiers loyal to the Crown and other disbanded soldiers and their families began to settle at the site of Cornwall, then called New Johnstown.<ref name=\"heritagefdn.on.ca\">{{cite web |url=https://www.heritagetrust.on.ca/en/plaques/founding-of-cornwall |title=Founding of Cornwall, The |accessdate=January 17, 2019 |publisher=Ontario Heritage Trust }}</ref> Many of the new arrivals were of German origin, with the town being named for [[Johnstown, New York]] where many came from.\n\nThe main group were led by Lieutenant-Colonel Sir John Johnson and were soldiers from the First Battalion King's Royal Regiment of New York and a contingent of the 84th Royal Highland Emigrants.  Following the success of rebellious colonists in the [[American Revolution]], many of those on afraid for their lives or uncomfortable in the newly independent United States would become \"United Empire Loyalists\", as they were later called, and migrated to Canada.  The British government helped them settle throughout the Canadas as a reward for their loyalty and to compensate them for their losses in the United States. One of the chief settlement regions was the St Lawrence River valley, from Kingston to Cornwall, which would later be known as \"loyalist country\".\n\nThey founded a settlement on the site formerly called ''Pointe Maligne'' by French colonists and renamed it \"Royal Settlement #2\", and, later, \"New Johnstown\".  It was later renamed Cornwall by the British for the [[Duke of Cornwall]] by proclamation of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince George]], and in 1834 the town became one of the first incorporated municipalities in the British colony of [[Upper Canada]].<ref>[http://fotw.fivestarflags.com/ca-on-co.html 5 Star Flags]</ref>  The construction of the [[Cornwall Canal]] between 1834 and 1842 accelerated the community's development into a regional and industrial economic \"capital\" for a growing hinterland of towns and villages.<ref name=\"heritagefdn.on.ca\"/><ref name=\"ParhamGreatWilderness\">{{cite book|last1=Parham|first1=Claire Puccia|title=From Great Wilderness to Seaway Towns: A Comparative History of Cornwall, Ontario, and Massena, New York, 1784-2001|date=2013|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=0791485676|page=46}}</ref>\n\nIn 1846, the population was about 1,600 and there were many brick and stone houses as well as a stone courthouse and jail.

There were no deaths or injuries reported, but several chimneys were destroyed or damaged, along with heavy damage to historical masonry structures. For example, the [[Cornwall Collegiate and Vocational School]] received heavy damage from masonry work falling through the roof of the gymnasium.\n\nSituated west of Cornwall along the [[St. Lawrence River]] were several smaller communities.

The villages were flooded when it was filled. Much of the Cornwall region's local character also changed at this time.\n\n==Ethnic history==\nEastern Ontario has always been a highway or corridor through which people moved, a corridor used by migration and conquest.  Prior to European colonization, the Mohawks and Six Nations [[Iroquois]] settled, raided and battled through the St. Lawrence valley.<ref>[[Akwesasne#History]]</ref>  The French and British fought over the waterway, often using and being used by native allies in highly complex economic competition.

To this mix was added an influx of American English Loyalists and refugees from the [[Thirteen Colonies]] (now the United States), other [[French Canadian]] and [[Acadian]] migrants and, later, poor Scottish and Irish immigrants and refugees who arrived from overseas and from other parts of Canada.

Most of these former slaves settled and integrated into the same communities where they were freed.  By 1833, this process of liberation had succeeded throughout the Empire and all slaves in the British Empire were free. The British Empire was the first major state in world history to abolish slavery, and Ontario was the place where this process first bore fruit.

In the aftermath of the American Revolution, the British authorities split the [[Province of Canada]] in 1791 into two, Upper Canada for English settlers fleeing persecution in the United States and Lower Canada for the French (later, [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]). This was designed to accommodate Loyalists who had fled post-war reprisals and persecution in the new United States, though the 5,000 English-speaking settlers in the Eastern Township of Quebec were allowed to stay in the French-speaking area and many French settlers moved into Ontario. Along with the area's original inhabitants, this made the area a patchwork of intersecting ethnicities that would end up blending to a great degree.  Cornwall and the surrounding area, originally called \"Royal Settlement #2\" and then \"New Jamestown\", was initially a rough place and was largely left to its own devices.  According to contemporary reports, this bred a local culture of intense self-reliance.  Adding to this initial history of pragmatic entrepreneurialism, beginning very early with the founding of the city, provincial and federal governments have typically neglected the area, treating it as little more than a transit corridor. Those who remained in the region tended to be those who had the fortitude and energy to survive on their own, with little outside assistance.\n\n\"The original 516 settlers arrived in Royal Township #2 with minimal supplies and faced years of hard work and possible starvation.  Upon their departure from military camps in Montreal, Pointe Claire, Saint Anne, and Lachine in the fall of 1784, Loyalists were given a tent, one month's worth of food rations, clothes, and agricultural provisions by regiment commanders.  They were promised one cow for every two families, an axe, and other necessary tools in the near future. For the next three years, bateaux (boat) crews delivered rations to the township, after which residents were left to fend for themselves.\"<ref name=\"sunypress.edu\"/>\n\nThe region's energetic spirit of enterprise and fortitude was well known in the 19th century.  [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]], the Welsh-Canadian explorer who mapped the Far West and was called the greatest land geographer in history, drew many of his traveling companions from Cornwall's rural hinterland, drawing on Scottish and native settlers, and himself lived in Williamstown.<ref>[[David Thompson (explorer)]]</ref>\n\nMore recently, Cornwall has seen an increase in the arrival of new immigrants,<ref>[http://www.city-data.com/canada/Cornwall-City-citizenship.html  Population, Age characteristics, Dwellings, Houses, Language, Education, Work, Industry, Earnings, Income, Immigration, Citizenship, Labor<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}}</ref> who tend to integrate and often fare better than immigrants in other parts of the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eotb-cfeo.on.ca/english/labour-market/update-on-cornwalls-economy.html |publisher=Eastern Ontario Training Board |title=Update on Cornwall's Economy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813042036/http://www.eotb-cfeo.on.ca/english/labour-market/update-on-cornwalls-economy.html |archive-date=August 13, 2016 |url-status=dead |access-date=November 4, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Historical integration==\nThe Cornwall region was unusually integrated for rural counties in Ontario.  For hundreds of years, the local population has been characterized by a mix of economic migrants, refugees and opportunists.  Mixing of different social classes and ethnic backgrounds was common even early in its history, due to the interdependence demanded by isolation and the lack of either support from or interference by official authorities.\n\nThe original Native population was remarkably welcoming, and the [[Iroquois]] were especially well known for integrating newcomers into local societies and for adapting to change as it happened.  Many people in the region have some Native ancestry as a result, and many communities sit on sites that have been occupied, farmed or managed for hundreds of years. While some people were pushed out, others simply blended into new communities in a process that would go on continuously over many generations.\n\nLack of strict hierarchy was a characteristic of the region. For example, during the 1780s\u20131830s, a \"Bee\" was a social event that pooled local labour resources, when people would come together for collective projects or to help out individual families, and was often a festive occasion.  These early \"Bees\" presaged the development of a varied and integrated culture that ultimately drew on many different classes, backgrounds and ethnic and linguistic groups, all of whom were forced by the harsh reality of life in the region to work together for common goals, the primary of which was survival.  These \"Bees\" and different forms of collective, shared labour were extremely common in Eastern Ontario generally, and especially so in the early villages of the St. Lawrence valley.\n\n\"In her book \"Roughing It in the Bush\", Susanna Moodie observed that \"people in the woods, have a craze for giving and going to bees and run to them with as much eagerness as a peasant runs to a race.\" Bees often involved all ranks and nationalities of society.  Thomas Need, a sawmill operator in Victoria County, described in From Great Wilderness to Seaway Towns the raising of his facility in 1834 in the following way:  \"They assembled in great force and all worked together in great harmony and good will not with- standing their different stations in life.\"  These gatherings exhibited the lack of aristocracy in the rural loyalist settlement along the St. Lawrence River and residents' disregard for individuals' former social standing or lineage... The harshness and isolation of frontier living prevented the development of an aristocracy and, instead, united all members of the community in a struggle for survival.  Early Loyalists, regardless of the amount of land they owned, depended upon the help of their neighbors to clear land, build homes, and share supplies and food during times of poor harvests.\"<ref name=\"sunypress.edu\"/>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Historical populations\n|type        = Canada\n|align       = \n|shading     = \n|percentages = \n|footnote    =\n|1986 | 46425\n|1991 | 47137\n|[[Canada 1996 Census|1996]]|47403\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]|45640\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]<ref name=\"cp2006\">{{cite web |title=2006 Community Profiles: Cornwall, Ontario (city) |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2006/dp-pd/prof/92-591/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3501012&Geo2=PR&Code2=35&Data=Count&SearchText=Cornwall&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=35&B1=All&Custom= |publisher=Statistics Canada |accessdate=January 17, 2019}}</ref>|45965\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]<ref name=\"cp2011\">{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3501012&Geo2=CD&Code2=3501&Data=Count&SearchText=Cornwall&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom=&TABID=1 |title=Cornwall census profile |publisher=Statistics Canada |work=[[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Census of Population]] |accessdate=March 21, 2012}}</ref>|46340\n|[[Canada 2016 Census|2016]]<ref name=\"census2016\"/>|46,589}}\n\nAs of 2016,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3501012&Geo2=PR&Code2=01&SearchText=Canada&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&TABID=1&type=1|title=Census Profile, 2016 Census - Cornwall, City [Census subdivision], Ontario and Canada [Country]|last=Government of Canada|first=Statistics Canada|date=2017-02-08|website=www12.statcan.gc.ca|access-date=2019-07-19}}</ref> Cornwall has a population of 46,589, an increase of 0.5% from 2011.

Further research, showed that infants under two years of age had four times the expected hospital admission rate for asthma.  Lung and male rectal cancer rates were also elevated in comparison with the rest of the province.\n\nThe shutdown of the Courtaulds rayon fiber operation (1992) and the Domtar paper mill (2006) have been a significant factor in the City's improved air quality.  Cornwall now consistently ranks in the top 10 of 40 monitored communities across Ontario.  More recently, a Pembina Institute study of 29 communities across Ontario looked at a number of environmental, social and economic factors.  Cornwall ranked 13th overall, and its air quality was ranked #1 in the province.\n\nCornwall was at one point one of only two cities left in the Province of Ontario with only primary sewage treatment facilities.  But construction was started in May 2012 on the secondary treatment level plant with the Governments of Canada and Ontario each covering one-third of an estimated $55.5 million construction cost.  The City picked up the remaining one-third of the cost of $18.5 million.  The secondary treatment level plant was completed in November 2014.\n\nIn 2006, the City updated its Strategic Plan, including the objective to develop an environmentally-sustainable community. {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\nIn 2007, a former city councillor, Naresh Bhargava, began working with the St. Lawrence River Institute of Environmental Sciences on a project called the Community Carbon Reduction Initiative.  City Council provided $5,000 in start-up funding for the project.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}  Earlier, progress in energy conservation was made in the 1990s when a co-generation plant went into operation that provides 4% to 6% of the City's daily electrical needs while at the same time heating a number of buildings, including both hospital sites.  Cornwall also converted all of its traffic signals in 2002 to energy efficient LEDs that have reduced power usage by more than 600,000&nbsp;kW\u2014enough to light close to 70 homes.  The data were contained in a report prepared by the City's public works department.\n\n===Climate===\nSimilar to most of southern Ontario, Cornwall has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfa/Dfb'') with cold, snowy winters and warm, humid summers.  Precipitation is significant year-round although the winter months are generally drier than the summer months.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Cornwall, 1981\u20132010 normals, extremes

This bridge is being torn down as it has been replaced by a much shorter low-level bridge to Cornwall Island.]]\n\n===Rail===\n\nThe [[Grand Trunk Railway]] (now [[CN Rail]]) built an east-west line through Cornwall in 1856, and its original station dated to that year. The [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] (NY&O) followed with a north-south line crossing the St. Lawrence, with a station in Cornwall dating to 1898.<ref name=canada-rail>{{cite web |url=https://www.canada-rail.com/ontario/c2/cornwall.html |title=Railway Stations in Cornwall Ontario |website=Canada-Rail.com |access-date=9 December 2019}}</ref> [[CP Rail|Canadian Pacific]] created a succession of subsidiaries and plans for a Cornwall line starting in the 1880s, culminating in the [[Glengarry and Stormont Railway]] in 1915, which connected to CP's [[Ontario and Quebec Railway]] mainline to the northeast, creating an alternative route to Montr\u00e9al.\n\nThe expansion of the St. Lawrence Seaway in the 1950s significantly disrupted the city's rail infrastructure, resulting in CN relocating its line northward, and the NY&O abandoning its line altogether. A new CN passenger station, which is still in use today by [[Via Rail]], was constructed in 1957 and the century-old Grand Trunk station was demolished shortly after, in 1962. The NY&O's passenger service ended in 1957 and its passenger station was demolished in the 1960s as well.<ref name=canada-rail /> CP passenger service ended even earlier, in 1952, and the CP passenger station was demolished in 1969.<ref name=canada-rail /> CP abandoned the line altogether in 1995.\n\nCurrently, Cornwall only has one significant rail line, the CN Kingston Subdivision, which functions as the CN mainline between Toronto and Montreal. It also serves as a component of [[Via Rail]]'s [[Qu\u00e9bec City\u2013Windsor Corridor (Via Rail)|Qu\u00e9bec City-Windsor corridor]]. Via Corridor passenger trains between [[Montr\u00e9al]] and [[Toronto]] stop at the [[Cornwall railway station]], which is located in the city's north end. Via's [[Via Rail#High Frequency Rail Project (HFR)|High-Frequency Rail]] (HFR) proposal, which would generally improve passenger rail service in [[Eastern Ontario]], would leave Cornwall unaffected, as most of the service improvements are planned to be focused on new lines constructed on abandoned rail rights of way, as well as existing Via-owned lines such as the Via Brockville Subdivision.\n\n====Street railway====\n\nAround the turn of the 20th century, Cornwall had a burgeoning electric street railway system, which transported freight and passengers throughout the city. The '''[[Cornwall Street Railway|Cornwall Electric Street Railway]]''' began passenger operations in 1896 and freight operations in 1899. Passenger operations ended in 1949 with a switch to [[trolleybus]] service, and electric freight operations ended in 1971 with the system's sale to CN Rail and subsequent [[dieselization]].<ref name=trainweb>{{cite web |url=http://www.trainweb.org/elso/csr-elec.htm |title=Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company |website=Trainweb.org |date=22 October 2009 |accessdate=9 December 2019}}</ref> During its time, the street railway was significant in the city's social and industrial development. Ultimately, its passenger tram service, after conversion to trolleybus, became the present-day Cornwall Transit, which provides municipal diesel bus service to this day.\n\n===Public transit===\n\nWith a fleet of 24 buses, [[Cornwall Transit]] operates 6 days per week (excluding Sundays and holidays) on fixed routes and supplementary rush hour routes.  In addition, there is an on-demand \"Handi-Transit\" service for the disabled.  Cornwall Transit also contracts taxi service at a flat rate for Handi-Transit registrants who are ambulatory.  The City-operated transit system transports approximately 860,000 passengers every year. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwall.ca/en/live-here/cornwall-transit.aspx|title=Cornwall Transit|date=2019-12-17|website=www.cornwall.ca|language=en|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref>\n\n===Air===\n\nCornwall is served by the [[Cornwall Regional Airport]], which is located {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} east of the city near Summerstown. It is open year-round and licensed for day and night VFR IFR operations. The facilities include a {{convert|3500|x|100|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} [[runway]], a [[Airport terminal|terminal]], [[hangar]], and the [[Canada Border Services Agency]] (on request). Domestic and international charter flying service from the airport is offered by Cornwall Aviation.\n\n===Sea===\n\nThe City of Cornwall is on the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] just east of the [[Eisenhower Locks|Eisenhower]] and [[Snell Locks|Snell]] [[Lock (water transport)|Locks]]. The [[Cornwall Harbour and Government wharf]] are located on the north bank of the St. Lawrence River in the city's east end.\n\n==Sports==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2019}}\nCornwall has two indoor arenas, the [[Cornwall Civic Complex]] and the [[Benson Centre]] with three ice surfaces.\n\n'''Hockey'''\n\nCornwall has been home to a variety of sports teams, the most notable of which was the [[Cornwall Royals]] hockey team which played in both the [[Quebec Major Junior Hockey League]] and the [[Ontario Hockey League]] before moving to [[Newmarket, Ontario|Newmarket]] in 1992.  The Royals won the [[Memorial Cup]] in 1972, 1980 and 1981.\n\nBetween the years 1993\u20131996, the [[Cornwall Aces]], an [[American Hockey League|AHL]] franchise, was in town.  They were the farm team for the [[NHL]] franchise the [[Quebec Nordiques]]/[[Colorado Avalanche]].\n\nThe [[Cornwall Colts]] are the current Junior A team playing in the [[Central Canada Hockey League]].  Cornwall has hosted several major sporting events in its history including the Ontario Winter Games and Special Olympics. In 2008, Cornwall hosted the Royal Bank Cup, the National Championship for Junior A hockey teams.  The Cornwall Colts finished third in the series, winning 2 of 5 games.  The Cornwall Colts hosted the Fred Page Cup in 2015 for the Eastern Canadian Championship.  Today, the teams represented in the Fred Page Cup are the Maritime Hockey League Champions (Kent Cup), the Ligue de Hockey Junior AAA du Qu\u00e9bec Champions (Napa Cup), the Ottawa District champions of the Central Canada Hockey League (Bogart-Nielsen Cup), and a host team chosen by committee two years before the tournament.\n\nThe [[Cornwall River Kings]] of the [[Ligue Nord-Am\u00e9ricaine de Hockey]] (LNAH) started playing out of the Civic Complex in the fall of 2012 but folded in 2016. The River Kings were replaced by the [[Cornwall Nationals]] of the [[Federal Hockey League]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.standard-freeholder.com/2016/09/14/cornwall-city-hall-inks-deal-with-fhl-nationals |title=Cornwall city hall inks deal with FHL Nationals |publisher=Standard-Freeholder |date=September 14, 2016 |access-date=September 16, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917084122/http://www.standard-freeholder.com/2016/09/14/cornwall-city-hall-inks-deal-with-fhl-nationals |archive-date=September 17, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> who folded during the 2017\u201318 season.\n\n'''Competitive Swimming'''\n\nCornwall's competitive swim team is the Cornwall Sea Lions, currently under the coaching of Simon St. Pierre. Two swimmers, Hannah Riordan  and Tess Simpson competed at junior international level.  Riordan and Simpson have also represented Canada at the second FINA World Junior Championships the Tri-Nations Cup,{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} and Riordan competed in the Junior Pan Pacifics, and Simpson in the Australian Youth festival. Four swimmers attained scholarships at NCAA schools (Riordan \u2013 Auburn, Simpson \u2013 Texas A&M, Megan Suffel \u2013 University of New Hampshire and Claudia Dugual at Drexal).  These four swimmers all received their fastest club times while under the coaching of Robert Eynon.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n'''Soccer'''\n\nCornwall has three soccer areas, the Kinsmen Junior Soccer Field at Second Street West and Haulage Road; The [[Benson Centre]] (for indoor soccer); and Optimist Park on Sunnyside Street and St. Michel Drive.\n\n'''Rugby'''\n\nCornwall has competitive men's and women's rugby clubs.  After many years without rugby in the community, it saw a resurrection in 2006. Both teams compete in the Eastern Ontario Rugby Union which is located in Ottawa.  The home of the Cornwall Crusaders Rugby Football Club is Cornwall Collegiate and Vocational School.  The men's and women's teams practice Tuesdays and Thursdays from April until the end of August.  The men's team has found success in recent{{when|date=January 2019}} years, winning the Eastern Ontario Men's Division 1 Championship in 2009 and 2010 against the Napanee Outlaws and the Gatineau Mirage, respectively.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe sport of rugby continues to grow in the community. Many high schools throughout Stormont, Dundas, and Glengarry have junior and senior boys' teams as well as varsity girls' teams.  These high school teams serve as feeders to the Cornwall Crusaders. Many players who play on the Crusaders today come from high schools in the S.D.& G. area.\n\n'''Roller Derby'''\nThe Seaway Roller Derby Girls Association is the first roller derby flat track roller derby league in Cornwall and SD&G Counties, established in 2011. The Power Dames is the first official team.\n\n'''Girls' basketball'''\nThe United Counties girls' basketball team won provincial and international basketball tournaments in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  In addition, the city offered girls' and women's basketball from age eight to college graduates.  The San Lawrence College women's team won a college tournament as well. The teams were coached by Adelore Bergeon and Alan Haskvitz.\n\n==Notable people==\nSome of the more famous people to hail from the Cornwall area include:\n* [[Barstool Prophets]], three of the four members of the Canadian rock band hailed from Cornwall, where the band had its start (Glenn Forrester, Graham Greer, Bobby Tamas)\n* [[Darby Bergin]], 1st Canadian [[Surgeon General (Canada)|Surgeon General]]\n* [[Malcolm Burn]], musician and record producer\n* [[Doug Carpenter]], former [[NHL]] coach\n* [[Alain Chevrier]], former NHL goaltender\n* [[Corbett Denneny]], former NHL player\n* [[Cy Denneny]], brother of Corbett, former NHL player, in the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]\n* [[Lori Dupuis]], Olympic gold and silver medalist in women's ice hockey\n* [[Jacob Gallinger]], United States politician\n* [[Peter Gatien]], New York nightlife [[impresario]]\n* [[Ryan Gosling]], actor\n* [[Alan Haskvitz]], National Hall of Fame and USA Today All American Educator\n* [[Christina Julien]], current member of the Canadian national women's soccer team\n* [[Chad Kilger]], retired NHL player\n* [[Bob Kilger]], former NHL referee, former mayor, father of [[Chad Kilger]]\n* [[Ed Lalonde|Ed \"Newsy\" Lalonde]], captained the [[Montreal Canadiens]] in the 1910s and helped the team win its first [[Stanley Cup]] in 1916\n* [[Donald Alexander Macdonald (general)|Donald Alexander Macdonald]], soldier\n* [[John Sandfield Macdonald]], prominent lawyer and the first [[Premier of Ontario]]\n* [[Maggie MacDonald]], playwright and musician\n* [[Don McKay]], Governor General's Award-winning poet and essayist\n* [[Duncan McNaughton]], gold medalist in the 1932 Olympics in the high jump\n* [[Ray Miron]], hockey player, coach, and executive, inducted into Cornwall Sports Hall of Fame\n* [[Scott Pearson]], former NHL player, drafted 6th overall to the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] in 1988\n* [[Nathan Phillips (politician)|Nathan Phillips]], Toronto mayor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontariojewisharchives.org/exhibits/osjc/communities/cornwall/earlycommunity/index.html|title=Ontario Jewish Communities {{!}} Cornwall - First Jewish Settlers|website=www.ontariojewisharchives.org|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref>\n* [[George Beverly Shea]], noted gospel singer, associated with Billy Graham crusades\n* [[John Strachan]], 19th-century Anglican priest and influential Bishop of Toronto\n* [[Orval Tessier]], former [[NHL]] player, coach of the Chicago Blackhawks and scout\n* Colonel The Hon.

The British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|siege of Port Royal]] took place in 1710, ending French-rule in peninsular Acadia. The subsequent signing of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713 formally recognized this, although saw the returned [[Cape Breton Island]] (''{{lang|fr|\u00cele Royale}}'') to the French. Despite the British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|conquest of Acadia]] in 1710, Nova Scotia remained primarily occupied by Catholic Acadians and Mi'kmaq, who confined British forces to Annapolis and to Canso. Present-day New Brunswick then still formed a part of the French colony of Acadia. Immediately after the capture of Port Royal in 1710, [[Francis Nicholson]] announced it would be renamed [[Annapolis Royal]] in honor of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].\n\nAs a result of [[Father Rale's War]] (1722\u20131725), the Mi'kmaq signed a series of treaties with Great Britain in 1725. The British signed a treaty (or \"agreement\") with the Mi'kmaq, but the authorities{{which|date=June 2016}} have often disputed its definition of the rights of the Mi'kmaq to hunt and fish on their lands.<ref>[http://www.apcfnc.ca/images/uploads/mascarenestreaty.pdf]</ref><ref>[http://www.stmarysfirstnation.com/consult/Treaty1.pdf]</ref> However, conflict between the Acadians, Mi'kmaq, French, and the British persisted in the following decades with [[King George's War]] (1744\u20131748). \n[[File:Deportation Grand-Pr\u00e9.jpg|thumb|[[Expulsion of the Acadians]] in [[Grand-Pr\u00e9, Nova Scotia|Grand-Pr\u00e9]].

The 75-year period of war ended with the [[Halifax Treaties]] between the British and the Mi'kmaq (1761). After the war, some Acadians were allowed to return and the British made treaties with the Mi\u2019kmaq.\n\nIn 1763, most of Acadia (Cape Breton Island, St. John's Island (now [[Prince Edward Island]]), and New Brunswick) became part of Nova Scotia. In 1765, the county of [[Sunbury County, Nova Scotia|Sunbury]] was created. This included the territory of present-day [[New Brunswick]] and eastern [[Maine]] as far as the [[Penobscot River]]. In 1769, St. John's Island became a separate colony.\n\nThe [[American Revolution]] (1775\u20131783) had a significant impact on shaping Nova Scotia. Initially, Nova Scotia\u2014\"the 14th American Colony\" as some called it\u2014displayed ambivalence over whether the colony should join the more southern colonies in their defiance of Britain, and rebellion flared at the [[Battle of Fort Cumberland]] (1776) and at the [[Siege of Saint John (1777)]]. Throughout the war, American [[privateers]] devastated the maritime economy by capturing ships and looting almost every community outside of Halifax. These American raids alienated many sympathetic or neutral Nova Scotians into supporting the British. By the end of the war Nova Scotia had outfitted a number of privateers to attack American shipping.<ref>Roger Marsters (2004). ''Bold Privateers: Terror, Plunder and Profit on Canada's Atlantic Coast'', pp. 87\u201389.</ref> British military forces based at Halifax succeeded in preventing American support for rebels in Nova Scotia and deterred any invasion of Nova Scotia. However the British navy failed to establish naval supremacy. While the British captured many American privateers in battles such as the [[Naval battle off Halifax]] (1782), many more continued attacks on shipping and settlements until the final months of the war. The Royal Navy struggled to maintain British supply lines, defending convoys from American and French attacks as in the fiercely fought convoy battle, the [[Naval battle off Cape Breton]] (1781).\n[[File:AricanNovaScotianByCaptain William Booth1788.png|thumb|A [[Black Loyalist]] wood cutter, at [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia]], in 1788]]\nAfter the Thirteen Colonies and their French allies forced the British forces to surrender (1781), approximately 33,000 [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] (the King's Loyal Americans, allowed to place \"[[United Empire Loyalist]]\" after their names) settled in Nova Scotia (14,000 of them in what became New Brunswick) on lands granted by the Crown as some compensation for their losses. (The British administration divided Nova Scotia and hived off Cape Breton and [[New Brunswick]] in 1784). The Loyalist exodus created new communities across Nova Scotia, including [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia|Shelburne]], which briefly became one of the larger British settlements in North America, and infused Nova Scotia with additional capital and skills. There are also a number of Black loyalists buried in unmarked graves in the [[Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia)]].\n\nHowever the migration also caused political tensions between Loyalist leaders and the leaders of the existing [[New England Planters]] settlement. The Loyalist influx also pushed Nova Scotia's 2000 Mi'kmaq People to the margins as Loyalist land grants encroached on ill-defined native lands. As part of the Loyalist migration, about 3,000 [[Black Loyalist]]s arrived; they founded the largest free Black settlement in North America at [[Birchtown, Nova Scotia|Birchtown]], near Shelburne. Many Nova Scotian communities were [[Nova Scotia in the American Revolution#Loyalist settlements|settled by British regiments that fought in the war]].\n\n====19th century====\n[[File:John Christian Schetky, H.M.S.

The [[Nova Scotia peninsula|peninsula]] that makes up Nova Scotia's mainland is connected to the rest of North America by the [[Isthmus of Chignecto]], on which the province's land border with [[New Brunswick]] is located. The province borders the [[Bay of Fundy]] to the northwest and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the south and east, and is separated from Prince Edward Island and the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] by the [[Northumberland Strait|Northumberland]] and [[Cabot Strait|Cabot]] straits, respectively.\n\nThe land that comprises what is now Nova Scotia has been inhabited by the indigenous [[Mi\ua78ckmaq]] people for thousands of years. [[France]]'s first settlement in North America, {{nobreak|[[Port-Royal National Historic Site|Port-Royal]]}}, was established in 1605 and intermittently served in various locations as the capital of the French colony of [[Acadia]] for over a hundred years. The [[Fortress of Louisbourg]] was a key focus point in the struggle between the British and French for control of the area, changing hands numerous times in the until France relinquished its claims with the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763. During the [[American Revolutionary War]], thousands of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] settled in Nova Scotia. In 1848, Nova Scotia became the first British colony to achieve [[responsible government]], and it [[Canadian Confederation|federated]] in July 1867 with New Brunswick and the [[Province of Canada]] (now [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]) to form what is now the country of Canada.\n\nNova Scotia's [[Capital city|capital]] and largest city is [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], which is today home to about 45 per cent of the province's population, is the [[List of census metropolitan areas and agglomerations in Canada|thirteenth-largest]] census metropolitan area in Canada<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/nova-scotia|title=Nova Scotia {{!}} The Canadian Encyclopedia|website=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>, the largest city in Atlantic Canada, and Canada's second-largest coastal city (after [[Vancouver]]).\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{Further|Etymology of Scotland}}\n\"Nova Scotia\" means \"New Scotland\" in Latin<ref>[http://www.novascotia.com/en/home/discovernovascotia/history/routestoyourroots/settlementpatterns/scottishsettlement.aspx Scottish Settlement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207152640/http://www.novascotia.com/en/home/discovernovascotia/history/routestoyourroots/settlementpatterns/scottishsettlement.aspx |date=7 December 2013 }}.

The British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|siege of Port Royal]] took place in 1710, ending French-rule in peninsular Acadia. The subsequent signing of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713 formally recognized this, although saw the returned [[Cape Breton Island]] (''{{lang|fr|\u00cele Royale}}'') to the French. Despite the British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|conquest of Acadia]] in 1710, Nova Scotia remained primarily occupied by Catholic Acadians and Mi'kmaq, who confined British forces to Annapolis and to Canso. Present-day New Brunswick then still formed a part of the French colony of Acadia. Immediately after the capture of Port Royal in 1710, [[Francis Nicholson]] announced it would be renamed [[Annapolis Royal]] in honor of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].\n\nAs a result of [[Father Rale's War]] (1722\u20131725), the Mi'kmaq signed a series of treaties with Great Britain in 1725. The British signed a treaty (or \"agreement\") with the Mi'kmaq, but the authorities{{which|date=June 2016}} have often disputed its definition of the rights of the Mi'kmaq to hunt and fish on their lands.<ref>[http://www.apcfnc.ca/images/uploads/mascarenestreaty.pdf]</ref><ref>[http://www.stmarysfirstnation.com/consult/Treaty1.pdf]</ref> However, conflict between the Acadians, Mi'kmaq, French, and the British persisted in the following decades with [[King George's War]] (1744\u20131748). \n[[File:Deportation Grand-Pr\u00e9.jpg|thumb|[[Expulsion of the Acadians]] in [[Grand-Pr\u00e9, Nova Scotia|Grand-Pr\u00e9]].

The 75-year period of war ended with the [[Halifax Treaties]] between the British and the Mi'kmaq (1761). After the war, some Acadians were allowed to return and the British made treaties with the Mi\u2019kmaq.\n\nIn 1763, most of Acadia (Cape Breton Island, St. John's Island (now [[Prince Edward Island]]), and New Brunswick) became part of Nova Scotia. In 1765, the county of [[Sunbury County, Nova Scotia|Sunbury]] was created. This included the territory of present-day [[New Brunswick]] and eastern [[Maine]] as far as the [[Penobscot River]]. In 1769, St. John's Island became a separate colony.\n\nThe [[American Revolution]] (1775\u20131783) had a significant impact on shaping Nova Scotia. Initially, Nova Scotia\u2014\"the 14th American Colony\" as some called it\u2014displayed ambivalence over whether the colony should join the more southern colonies in their defiance of Britain, and rebellion flared at the [[Battle of Fort Cumberland]] (1776) and at the [[Siege of Saint John (1777)]]. Throughout the war, American [[privateers]] devastated the maritime economy by capturing ships and looting almost every community outside of Halifax. These American raids alienated many sympathetic or neutral Nova Scotians into supporting the British. By the end of the war Nova Scotia had outfitted a number of privateers to attack American shipping.<ref>Roger Marsters (2004). ''Bold Privateers: Terror, Plunder and Profit on Canada's Atlantic Coast'', pp. 87\u201389.</ref> British military forces based at Halifax succeeded in preventing American support for rebels in Nova Scotia and deterred any invasion of Nova Scotia. However the British navy failed to establish naval supremacy. While the British captured many American privateers in battles such as the [[Naval battle off Halifax]] (1782), many more continued attacks on shipping and settlements until the final months of the war. The Royal Navy struggled to maintain British supply lines, defending convoys from American and French attacks as in the fiercely fought convoy battle, the [[Naval battle off Cape Breton]] (1781).\n[[File:AricanNovaScotianByCaptain William Booth1788.png|thumb|A [[Black Loyalist]] wood cutter, at [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia]], in 1788]]\nAfter the Thirteen Colonies and their French allies forced the British forces to surrender (1781), approximately 33,000 [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] (the King's Loyal Americans, allowed to place \"[[United Empire Loyalist]]\" after their names) settled in Nova Scotia (14,000 of them in what became New Brunswick) on lands granted by the Crown as some compensation for their losses. (The British administration divided Nova Scotia and hived off Cape Breton and [[New Brunswick]] in 1784). The Loyalist exodus created new communities across Nova Scotia, including [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia|Shelburne]], which briefly became one of the larger British settlements in North America, and infused Nova Scotia with additional capital and skills. There are also a number of Black loyalists buried in unmarked graves in the [[Old Burying Ground (Halifax, Nova Scotia)]].\n\nHowever the migration also caused political tensions between Loyalist leaders and the leaders of the existing [[New England Planters]] settlement. The Loyalist influx also pushed Nova Scotia's 2000 Mi'kmaq People to the margins as Loyalist land grants encroached on ill-defined native lands. As part of the Loyalist migration, about 3,000 [[Black Loyalist]]s arrived; they founded the largest free Black settlement in North America at [[Birchtown, Nova Scotia|Birchtown]], near Shelburne. Many Nova Scotian communities were [[Nova Scotia in the American Revolution#Loyalist settlements|settled by British regiments that fought in the war]].\n\n====19th century====\n[[File:John Christian Schetky, H.M.S.

As a result, Britain (and Nova Scotia) continued to trade with both the [[Confederate States of America|South]] and the North.

The [[Anti-Confederation Party]] was led by [[Joseph Howe]]. Almost three months later, in the election of 18 September 1867, the Anti-Confederation Party won 18 out of 19 federal seats, and 36 out of 38 seats in the provincial legislature.\n\nThroughout the 19th century, numerous businesses developed in Nova Scotia became of pan-Canadian and international importance: the [[Starr Manufacturing Company]] (first skate-manufacturer in Canada), the [[Bank of Nova Scotia]], [[Cunard Line]], [[Alexander Keith's Brewery]], [[Morse's Tea Company]] (first tea company in Canada), among others. \n[[File:Bluenose sailing 1921.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Bluenose]]'' in 1921.

Nova Scotia produced internationally recognized shipbuilders [[Donald McKay]] and [[William Dawson Lawrence]]. The fame Nova Scotia achieved from sailors was assured when [[Joshua Slocum]] became the first man to sail single-handedly around the world (1895). International attention continued into the following century with the many racing victories of the ''[[Bluenose]]'' schooner. Nova Scotia was also the birthplace and home of [[Samuel Cunard]], a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] shipping magnate (born at [[Halifax (former city)|Halifax]], Nova Scotia) who founded the [[Cunard Line]].\n\nIn 1937, [[Everett Farmer]] was the last person hanged (for murder) in Nova Scotia.<ref name=nscourts/>\n\n== Demography ==\n{{Main|Demographics of Nova Scotia}}\n\n=== Ethnic origins ===\nAccording to the 2006 Canadian census<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/demo26d-eng.htm |title= Population by selected ethnic origins, by province and territory (2006 Census) (Nova Scotia) | author= Statistics Canada | authorlink= Statistics Canada|date=January 2005 | accessdate=9 July 2015}}</ref> the largest ethnic group in Nova Scotia is [[Scottish people|Scottish]] (31.9%), followed by English (31.8%), Irish (21.6%), French (17.9%), German (11.3%), [[First Nations|Aboriginal origin]] (5.3%), [[Dutch people|Dutch]] (4.1%), [[Black Nova Scotians|Black Canadians]] (2.8%), [[Welsh people|Welsh]] (1.9%) Italian (1.5%), and [[North Germanic peoples|Scandinavian]] (1.4%). 40.9% of respondents identified their ethnicity as \"Canadian\".\n\n=== Language ===\n{{See also|Maritimer English|Cape Breton English|Acadian French|Canadian Gaelic}}\nThe [[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Canadian census]] showed a population of 921,727.

Bouquet is best known for his victory over a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] force at the [[Battle of Bushy Run]], lifting the [[siege of Fort Pitt]] during Pontiac's War. During the conflict Bouquet gained lasting infamy in an exchange of letters with his commanding officer Amherst who suggested a form of biological warfare in the use of blankets infected with smallpox which were to be distributed to Native Americans.<ref>[http://www.umass.edu/legal/derrico/amherst/34_40_305_fn.jpeg Postscript of Bouquet's letter to Amherst, 13 July 1763]</ref> Despite this indictment historians have praised Bouquet for leading British forces in several demanding campaigns on the Western Frontier in which they \"protected and rescued\" settlers from increasingly frequent attacks.<ref>{{cite book |title=Defenders of the Frontier: Colonel Henry Bouquet and the Officers and Men of the Royal American Regiment, 1763-1764|date=18 January 2018 |author=Kenneth Stuart, Ph.D|page=6|publisher=Heritage Books}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nBouquet was born into a moderately wealthy family in [[Rolle]], [[Swiss Confederacy]] and the oldest of seven brothers. The son of a Swiss roadhouse owner and his well-to-do wife, he entered military service at the age of 17.<ref name=Bomberger /> Like many military officers of his day, Bouquet traveled between countries serving as a professional soldier. He began his military career in the army of the [[Dutch Republic]] and later was in the service of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]. In 1748, he was again in Dutch service as [[lieutenant colonel]] of the Swiss guards.\n\n==French and Indian War==\n{{further|Great Britain in the Seven Years War}}\nHe entered the [[British Army]] in 1754 as a lieutenant colonel in the 60th Regiment of Foot ([[King's Royal Rifle Corps|The Royal American Regiment]]),<ref name=Bomberger />  a unit made up largely of members of Pennsylvania's German immigrant community. After leading the Royal Americans to [[Charleston, South Carolina]] to bolster that city's defences, the regiment was recalled to Philadelphia to take part in General [[John Forbes (British Army officer)|John Forbes]]' [[Forbes Expedition|expedition]] against [[Fort Duquesne]] in 1758.\n\nWhile Bouquet travelled down the road from Fort Bedford, his troops [[Battle of Fort Ligonier|were attacked]] by French and Indians at [[Loyalhanna Creek|Loyalhanna]], near present [[Ligonier, Pennsylvania]], but the attack was repulsed and they continued on to [[Fort Duquesne]], only to find it razed by the fleeing French.<ref name=Chronology>{{cite web|last=Laurent|first=Stefan|title=Historic Pittsburgh Chronology|url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/chronology/chronology_driver.pl?searchtype=dbrowse;year=1750;year2=1759;start_line=0|work=Historic Pittsburgh|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|accessdate=17 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Pontiac's War==\n[[File:Henry Bouquet at Muskingum.png|thumb|right|The Indians returning English captives to Colonel Henry Bouquet in November 1764.]] \nIn 1763, bands of Native Americans joined forces to remove the British from their territory in what is most often called [[Pontiac's War]]. [[Pontiac (Ottawa leader)|Pontiac]], an Ottawa war leader, began urging the Indian tribes that had been allied to the French during the French and Indian War to join together to continue the fight to remove the British from the territory. Pontiac initiated attacks on the western-most frontier forts and settlements, believin defeated French would rally and come to their aid. The start of the conflict is usually described as the siege of [[Fort Detroit]] on 10 May 1763. [[Fort Sandusky]], [[Fort Michilimackinac]], [[Fort Presque Isle]], and numerous other frontier outposts were quickly overrun.\n\nSeveral frontier forts in the [[Ohio Country]] had fallen to the allied tribes, and [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]], [[Fort Ligionier]], and [[Fort Bedford]] along Forbes's road were besieged or threatened. Bouquet, who was in [[Philadelphia]], threw together a hastily organised force of 500 men, mostly Scots Highlanders, to relieve the forts. On 5 August 1763, Bouquet and the relief column were attacked by warriors from the [[Lenape|Delaware]], [[Mingo]], [[Shawnee]], and [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] tribes near a small outpost called [[Battle of Bushy Run|Bushy Run]], in what is now [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania]]. In a two-day battle, Bouquet defeated the tribes and Fort Pitt was relieved. The battle marked a turning point in the war.\n\nIt was during Pontiac's War that Bouquet gained a certain lasting infamy. In a series of letters during the summer of 1763 between Bouquet and his commander, General [[Jeffery Amherst]], the idea was proposed and agreed upon to infect the Indians near Fort Pitt with [[smallpox]] by giving them infected blankets from the fort's smallpox hospital. Amherst wrote to Bouquet, then in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], on about 29 June 1763: \"Could it not be contrived to send the small pox among those disaffected tribes of Indians? We must on this occasion use every stratagem in our power to reduce them.\"<ref>''The Conspiracy of Pontiac and the Indian War after the Conquest of Canada'', Francis Parkman, 1886 - Vol. II, p. 39 (6th edition)</ref> Bouquet agreed, replying to Amherst on 13 July: \"I will try to inoculate the Indians by means of blankets that may fall in their hands, taking care however not to get the disease myself.\"<ref>[http://www.umass.edu/legal/derrico/amherst/34_40_305_fn.jpeg Postscript of Bouquet's letter to Amherst, 13 July 1763]</ref> Amherst responded on 16 July: \"You will do well to try to inoculate the Indians by means of blankets, as well as to try every other method that can serve to extirpate this execrable race.\"<ref>[http://www.umass.edu/legal/derrico/amherst/34_41_114_fn.jpeg Amherst's reply to Bouquet, 16 July 1763]</ref>\n\nThe journal of William Trent, the commander of the militia at the fort, has provided additional evidence that this plan was carried out, though it appears that the plan had already been carried out before Amherst had proposed it to Bouquet.:\n<blockquote>''[June] 24th [1763] The Turtles Heart a principal Warrior of the Delawares and Mamaltee a Chief came within a small distance of the Fort Mr. McKee went out to them and they made a Speech letting us know that all our [POSTS] as Ligonier was destroyed, that great numbers of Indians [were coming and] that out of regard to us, they had prevailed on 6 Nations [not to] attack us but give us time to go down the Country and they desired we would set of immediately. The Commanding Officer thanked them, let them know that we had everything we wanted, that we could defend it against all the Indians in the Woods, that we had three large Armys marching to Chastise those Indians that had struck us, told them to take care of their Women and Children, but not to tell any other Natives, they said they would go and speak to their Chiefs and come and tell us what they said, they returned and said they would hold fast of the Chain of friendship. Out of our regard to them we gave them two Blankets and an Handkerchief out of the Small Pox Hospital. I hope it will have the desired effect. They then told us that Ligonier had been attacked, but that the Enemy were beat of.''<ref>[http://www.hsp.org/sites/www.hsp.org/files/migrated/pagesfromwilliamtrentsjournal.pdf William Trent's Journal]</ref></blockquote>\nIt is unknown if Amherst and Bouquet had knowledge of Captain Ecuyer, McKee and Trent's actions when they were discussing the idea or if they had been given orders to carry out the plan from Bouquet, Amherst, or someone else or if they came up with the same plan on their own. What is known is that an outbreak of smallpox did occur among the Indians of the area.  Since the smallpox incident at Fort Pitt, it is estimated that 400,000-500,000 (possibly up to 1.5 million) Native Americans - men, women, and children - died during and years after the Pontiac's War, mostly from smallpox given by the British and some in the outside infected areas than in combat. The incident at Fort Pitt was one of the first known cases of deliberate [[biological warfare]] in North America.<ref>Crawford, ''Native Americans of the Pontiac's War'', 245\u2013250</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=American Indian Chronology: Chronologies of the American Mosaic |date=2 June 2011 |author=Phillip M.

A. Graham & Co.}}</ref> On 13 October 1764, Bouquet's army reached the [[Tuscarawas River]]. Shortly thereafter, representatives from the Shawnees, [[Seneca tribe|Senecas]], and Delawares came to Bouquet to sue for peace.{{cn|date=November 2015}}\n\nBouquet then moved his army from the Tuscarawas River to the [[Muskingum River]] at modern-day [[Coshocton, Ohio]]. This placed him in the heart of tribal lands and would allow him to quickly strike the natives' villages if they refused to cooperate. As part of the peace treaty, Bouquet demanded the return of all white captives in exchange for a promise not to destroy the Indian villages or seize any of their land. The return of the captives caused much bitterness among the tribesmen, because many of them had been forcibly adopted into Indian families as small children, and living among the Native Americans had been the only life they remembered. Some 'white Indians' such as [[Rhoda Boyd]] managed to escape back into the native villages; many others were never exchanged. Bouquet was responsible for the return more than 200 white captives to the settlements back east.{{cn|date=November 2015}}\n\n==Promotion and sudden death==\nIn 1765, Bouquet was promoted to brigadier general and placed in command of all British forces in the southern colonies.

The son of a Swiss roadhouse owner and his well-to-do wife, he entered military service at the age of 17.<ref name=Bomberger /> Like many military officers of his day, Bouquet traveled between countries serving as a professional soldier. He began his military career in the army of the [[Dutch Republic]] and later was in the service of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]. In 1748, he was again in Dutch service as [[lieutenant colonel]] of the Swiss guards.\n\n==French and Indian War==\n{{further|Great Britain in the Seven Years War}}\nHe entered the [[British Army]] in 1754 as a lieutenant colonel in the 60th Regiment of Foot ([[King's Royal Rifle Corps|The Royal American Regiment]]),<ref name=Bomberger />  a unit made up largely of members of Pennsylvania's German immigrant community. After leading the Royal Americans to [[Charleston, South Carolina]] to bolster that city's defences, the regiment was recalled to Philadelphia to take part in General [[John Forbes (British Army officer)|John Forbes]]' [[Forbes Expedition|expedition]] against [[Fort Duquesne]] in 1758.\n\nWhile Bouquet travelled down the road from Fort Bedford, his troops [[Battle of Fort Ligonier|were attacked]] by French and Indians at [[Loyalhanna Creek|Loyalhanna]], near present [[Ligonier, Pennsylvania]], but the attack was repulsed and they continued on to [[Fort Duquesne]], only to find it razed by the fleeing French.<ref name=Chronology>{{cite web|last=Laurent|first=Stefan|title=Historic Pittsburgh Chronology|url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/chronology/chronology_driver.pl?searchtype=dbrowse;year=1750;year2=1759;start_line=0|work=Historic Pittsburgh|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|accessdate=17 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Pontiac's War==\n[[File:Henry Bouquet at Muskingum.png|thumb|right|The Indians returning English captives to Colonel Henry Bouquet in November 1764.]] \nIn 1763, bands of Native Americans joined forces to remove the British from their territory in what is most often called [[Pontiac's War]]. [[Pontiac (Ottawa leader)|Pontiac]], an Ottawa war leader, began urging the Indian tribes that had been allied to the French during the French and Indian War to join together to continue the fight to remove the British from the territory. Pontiac initiated attacks on the western-most frontier forts and settlements, believing the defeated French would rally and come to their aid. The start of the conflict is usually described as the siege of [[Fort Detroit]] on 10 May 1763. [[Fort Sandusky]], [[Fort Michilimackinac]], [[Fort Presque Isle]], and numerous other frontier outposts were quickly overrun.\n\nSeveral frontier forts in the [[Ohio Country]] had fallen to the allied tribes, and [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]], [[Fort Ligionier]], and [[Fort Bedford]] along Forbes's road were besieged or threatened. Bouquet, who was in [[Philadelphia]], threw together a hastily organised force of 500 men, mostly Scots Highlanders, to relieve the forts. On 5 August 1763, Bouquet and the relief column were attacked by warriors from the [[Lenape|Delaware]], [[Mingo]], [[Shawnee]], and [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] tribes near a small outpost called [[Battle of Bushy Run|Bushy Run]], in what is now [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania]]. In a two-day battle, Bouquet defeated the tribes and Fort Pitt was relieved. The battle marked a turning point in the war.\n\nIt was during Pontiac's War that Bouquet gained a certain lasting infamy. In a series of letters during the summer of 1763 between Bouquet and his commander, General [[Jeffery Amherst]], the idea was proposed and agreed upon to infect the Indians near Fort Pitt with [[smallpox]] by giving them infected blankets from the fort's smallpox hospital. Amherst wrote to Bouquet, then in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]], on about 29 June 1763: \"Could it not be contrived to send the small pox among those disaffected tribes of Indians? We must on this occasion use every stratagem in our power to reduce them.\"<ref>''The Conspiracy of Pontiac and the Indian War after the Conquest of Canada'', Francis Parkman, 1886 - Vol. II, p. 39 (6th edition)</ref> Bouquet agreed, replying to Amherst on 13 July: \"I will try to inoculate the Indians by means of blankets that may fall in their hands, taking care however not to get the disease myself.\"<ref>[http://www.umass.edu/legal/derrico/amherst/34_40_305_fn.jpeg Postscript of Bouquet's letter to Amherst, 13 July 1763]</ref> Amherst responded on 16 July: \"You will do well to try to inoculate the Indians by means of blankets, as well as to try every other method that can serve to extirpate this execrable race.\"<ref>[http://www.umass.edu/legal/derrico/amherst/34_41_114_fn.jpeg Amherst's reply to Bouquet, 16 July 1763]</ref>\n\nThe journal of William Trent, the commander of the militia at the fort, has provided additional evidence that this plan was carried out, though it appears that the plan had already been carried out before Amherst had proposed it to Bouquet.:\n<blockquote>''[June] 24th [1763] The Turtles Heart a principal Warrior of the Delawares and Mamaltee a Chief came within a small distance of the Fort Mr. McKee went out to them and they made a Speech letting us know that all our [POSTS] as Ligonier was destroyed, that great numbers of Indians [were coming and] that out of regard to us, they had prevailed on 6 Nations [not to] attack us but give us time to go down the Country and they desired we would set of immediately. The Commanding Officer thanked them, let them know that we had everything we wanted, that we could defend it against all the Indians in the Woods, that we had three large Armys marching to Chastise those Indians that had struck us, told them to take care of their Women and Children, but not to tell any other Natives, they said they would go and speak to their Chiefs and come and tell us what they said, they returned and said they would hold fast of the Chain of friendship. Out of our regard to them we gave them two Blankets and an Handkerchief out of the Small Pox Hospital. I hope it will have the desired effect. They then told us that Ligonier had been attacked, but that the Enemy were beat of.''<ref>[http://www.hsp.org/sites/www.hsp.org/files/migrated/pagesfromwilliamtrentsjournal.pdf William Trent's Journal]</ref></blockquote>\nIt is unknown if Amherst and Bouquet had knowledge of Captain Ecuyer, McKee and Trent's actions when they were discussing the idea or if they had been given orders to carry out the plan from Bouquet, Amherst, or someone else or if they came up with the same plan on their own. What is known is that an outbreak of smallpox did occur among the Indians of the area.  Since the smallpox incident at Fort Pitt, it is estimated that 400,000-500,000 (possibly up to 1.5 million) Native Americans - men, women, and children - died during and years after the Pontiac's War, mostly from smallpox given by the British and some in the outside infected areas than in combat.

Shortly thereafter, representatives from the Shawnees, [[Seneca tribe|Senecas]], and Delawares came to Bouquet to sue for peace.{{cn|date=November 2015}}\n\nBouquet then moved his army from the Tuscarawas River to the [[Muskingum River]] at modern-day [[Coshocton, Ohio]]. This placed him in the heart of tribal lands and would allow him to quickly strike the natives' villages if they refused to cooperate. As part of the peace treaty, Bouquet demanded the return of all white captives in exchange for a promise not to destroy the Indian villages or seize any of their land. The return of the captives caused much bitterness among the tribesmen, because many of them had been forcibly adopted into Indian families as small children, and living among the Native Americans had been the only life they remembered. Some 'white Indians' such as [[Rhoda Boyd]] managed to escape back into the native villages; many others were never exchanged. Bouquet was responsible for the return more than 200 white captives to the settlements back east.{{cn|date=November 2015}}\n\n==Promotion and sudden death==\nIn 1765, Bouquet was promoted to brigadier general and placed in command of all British forces in the southern colonies.

This phenomenon is now referred to as multi-bubble sonoluminescence (MBSL).\n\nIn 1960 Peter Jarman from [[Imperial_College_London|Imperial College of London]] proposed the most reliable theory of sonoluminescence phenomenon. The collapsing bubble generates an imploding shock wave that compresses and heats the gas at the center of the bubble to extremely high temperature.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn 1989 an experimental advance was introduced which produced stable single-bubble sonoluminescence (SBSL).{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} In single-bubble sonoluminescence, a single bubble trapped in an acoustic standing wave emits a pulse of light with each compression of the bubble within the [[standing wave]]. This technique allowed a more systematic study of the phenomenon, because it isolated the complex effects into one stable, predictable bubble.

This cavity may take the form of a pre-existing bubble, or may be generated through a process known as [[cavitation]]. Sonoluminescence in the laboratory can be made to be stable, so that a single bubble will expand and collapse over and over again in a periodic fashion, emitting a burst of light each time it collapses. For this to occur, a standing acoustic wave is set up within a liquid, and the bubble will sit at a pressure [[anti-node]] of the standing wave. The [[frequency|frequencies]] of [[resonance]] depend on the shape and size of the container in which the bubble is contained.\n\nSome facts about sonoluminescence: {{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n* The light flashes from the bubbles last between 35 and a few hundred [[picosecond]]s long, with peak intensities of the order of 1\u2013{{val|10|ul=mW}}.\n* The bubbles are very small when they emit the light\u2014about 1 [[micrometre]] in diameter\u2014depending on the ambient fluid (e.g., water) and the gas content of the bubble (e.g., [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric air]]).\n* Single-bubble sonoluminescence pulses can have very stable periods and positions. In fact, the frequency of light flashes can be more stable than the rated frequency stability of the oscillator making the sound waves driving them. However, the stability analyses of the bubble show that the bubble itself undergoes significant geometric instabilities, due to, for example, the [[Bjerknes force]]s and [[Rayleigh\u2013Taylor instability|Rayleigh\u2013Taylor instabilities]].\n* The addition of a small amount of [[noble gas]] (such as [[helium]], [[argon]], or [[xenon]]) to the gas in the bubble increases the intensity of the emitted light.\n\nSpectral measurements have given bubble temperatures in the range from {{val|2300|u=K}} to {{val|5100|u=K}}, the exact temperatures depending on experimental conditions including the composition of the liquid and gas.<ref name=flannigan>{{cite journal | vauthors = Didenko YT, McNamara WB, Suslick KS | title = Effect of noble gases on sonoluminescence temperatures during multibubble cavitation | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 84 | issue = 4 | pages = 777\u201380 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 11017370 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.84.777 | bibcode = 2000PhRvL..84..777D }}</ref> Detection of very high bubble temperatures by spectral methods is limited due to the opacity of liquids to short wavelength light characteristic of very high temperatures.\n\nA study describes a method of determining temperatures based on the formation of [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]].

This equation, though approximate, has been shown to give good estimates on the motion of the bubble under the [[acoustics|acoustically]] driven field except during the final stages of collapse.

Chemical reactions cause [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] to be removed from the bubble after about one hundred expansion-collapse cycles.

The amount ionized is small enough for the bubble to remain transparent, allowing volume emission; surface emission would produce more intense light of longer duration, dependent on [[wavelength]], contradicting experimental results. Electrons from ionized atoms interact mainly with neutral atoms, causing thermal bremsstrahlung radiation. As the wave hits a low energy trough, the pressure drops, allowing electrons to [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombine]] with atoms and light emission to cease due to this lack of free electrons. This makes for a 160-picosecond light pulse for argon (even a small drop in temperature causes a large drop in ionization, due to the large [[ionization energy]] relative to photon energy).

This cavity may take the form of a pre-existing bubble, or may be generated through a process known as [[cavitation]]. Sonoluminescence in the laboratory can be made to be stable, so that a single bubble will expand and collapse over and over again in a periodic fashion, emitting a burst of light each time it collapses. For this to occur, a standing acoustic wave is set up within a liquid, and the bubble will sit at a pressure [[anti-node]] of the standing wave. The [[frequency|frequencies]] of [[resonance]] depend on the shape and size of the container in which the bubble is contained.\n\nSome facts about sonoluminescence: {{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n* The light flashes from the bubbles last between 35 and a few hundred [[picosecond]]s long, with peak intensities of the order of 1\u2013{{val|10|ul=mW}}.\n* The bubbles are very small when they emit the light\u2014about 1 [[micrometre]] in diameter\u2014depending on the ambient fluid (e.g., water) and the gas content of the bubble (e.g., [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric air]]).\n* Single-bubble sonoluminescence pulses can have very stable periods and positions. In fact, the frequency of light flashes can be more stable than the rated frequency stability of the oscillator making the sound waves driving them. However, the stability analyses of the bubble show that the bubble itself undergoes significant geometric instabilities, due to, for example, the [[Bjerknes force]]s and [[Rayleigh\u2013Taylor instability|Rayleigh\u2013Taylor instabilities]].\n* The addition of a small amount of [[noble gas]] (such as [[helium]], [[argon]], or [[xenon]]) to the gas in the bubble increases the intensity of the emitted light.\n\nSpectral measurements have given bubble temperatures in the range from {{val|2300|u=K}} to {{val|5100|u=K}}, the exact temperatures depending on experimental conditions including the composition of the liquid and gas.<ref name=flannigan>{{cite journal | vauthors = Didenko YT, McNamara WB, Suslick KS | title = Effect of noble gases on sonoluminescence temperatures during multibubble cavitation | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 84 | issue = 4 | pages = 777\u201380 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 11017370 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.84.777 | bibcode = 2000PhRvL..84..777D }}</ref> Detection of very high bubble temperatures by spectral methods is limited due to the opacity of liquids to short wavelength light characteristic of very high temperatures.\n\nA study describes a method of determining temperatures based on the formation of [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]].

The amount ionized is small enough for the bubble to remain transparent, allowing volume emission; surface emission would produce more intense light of longer duration, dependent on [[wavelength]], contradicting experimental results. Electrons from ionized atoms interact mainly with neutral atoms, causing thermal bremsstrahlung radiation. As the wave hits a low energy trough, the pressure drops, allowing electrons to [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombine]] with atoms and light emission to cease due to this lack of free electrons. This makes for a 160-picosecond light pulse for argon (even a small drop in temperature causes a large drop in ionization, due to the large [[ionization energy]] relative to photon energy).

The animal snaps a specialized claw shut to create a cavitation bubble that generates acoustic pressures of up to 80 kPa at a distance of 4&nbsp;cm from the claw. As it extends out from the claw, the bubble reaches speeds of 60 miles per hour (97&nbsp;km/h) and releases a sound reaching 218 decibels. The pressure is strong enough to kill small fish. The light produced is of lower intensity than the light produced by typical sonoluminescence and is not visible to the naked eye. The light and heat produced may have no direct significance, as it is the shockwave produced by the rapidly collapsing bubble which these shrimp use to stun or kill prey.

The work's subtitle was \"An attempt to explain the former changes of the Earth's surface by reference to causes now in operation\". He drew his explanations from field studies conducted directly before he went to work on the founding geology text,<ref>Wilson, Leonard G. \"Charles Lyell\" ''Dictionary of Scientific Biography''. Ed. Charles Coulston Gillispie. Vol. VIII. Pennsylvania, Charles Scribner's Sons, 1973</ref> and developed Hutton's idea that the earth was shaped entirely by slow-moving forces still in operation today, acting over a very long period of time. The terms ''uniformitarianism'' for this idea, and ''[[catastrophism]]'' for the opposing viewpoint, were coined by [[William Whewell]] in a review of Lyell's book. ''Principles of Geology'' was the  most influential geological work in the middle of the 19th century.\n\n====Systems of inorganic earth history====\n\nGeoscientists support diverse systems of Earth history, the nature of which rest on a certain mixture of views about process, control, rate, and state which are preferred.

An important result of this debate and others was the re-clarification that, while the same principles operate in geologic time, catastrophic events that are infrequent on human time-scales can have important consequences in geologic history.<ref>Allen, E.

He rejected the third (uniformity of rate) as an unjustified limitation on scientific inquiry, as it constrains past geologic rates and conditions to those of the present. So, Lyellian uniformitarianism was unnecessary.\n\nUniformitarianism was proposed in contrast to [[catastrophism]], which states that the distant past \"consisted of epochs of paroxysmal and catastrophic action interposed between periods of comparative tranquility\"<ref>William J. Whewell, ''Principles of Geology'', Charles Leyell, vol. II, London, 1832: Quart. Rev., v. 47, p. 103-123.</ref> Especially in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, most geologists took this interpretation to mean that catastrophic events are not important in geologic time; one example of this is the debate of the formation of the [[Channeled Scablands]] due to the catastrophic [[Missoula floods|Missoula]] glacial outburst floods. An important result of this debate and others was the re-clarification that, while the same principles operate in geologic time, catastrophic events that are infrequent on human time-scales can have important consequences in geologic history.<ref>Allen, E.

The very word 'Catastrophism' was heinous in the ears of geologists. ... It was a step backwards, a betrayal of ''all that geological science had fought to gain''.

Later, groups of people called ''fuhito'' were organized under the monarch to read and write [[Classical Chinese]]. During the reign of [[Empress Suiko]] (593\u2013628), the Yamato court began sending full-scale diplomatic missions to China, which resulted in a large increase in Chinese literacy at the Japanese court.<ref name=\"miyake9\" />\n\nIn ancient times paper was so rare that people stenciled kanji onto thin, rectangular strips of wood. These wooden boards were used for communication between government offices, tags for goods transported between various countries, and the practice of writing. The oldest written kanji in Japan discovered so far was written in ink on wood as a wooden strip dated to the 7th century. It is a record of trading for cloth and salt.<ref>{{Cite web| title =Kanji History in Japan| url = https://ateliers-japon.com/#home | publisher=Les Ateliers de Japon}}</ref><sup>[''No longer mentioned in source'']</sup>\n\nThe Japanese language had no written form at the time Chinese characters were introduced, and texts were written and read only in Chinese. Later, during the [[Heian period]] (794\u20131185), however, a system known as ''[[kanbun]]'' emerged, which involved using Chinese text with [[diacritical mark]]s to allow Japanese speakers to restructure and read Chinese sentences, by changing word order and adding particles and verb endings, in accordance with the rules of [[Japanese grammar]].\n\nChinese characters also came to be used to write Japanese words, resulting in the modern kana syllabaries. Around 650 AD, a writing system called ''[[man'y\u014dgana]]'' (used in the ancient poetry anthology ''[[Man'y\u014dsh\u016b]]'') evolved that used a number of Chinese characters for their sound, rather than for their meaning. Man'y\u014dgana written in [[Grass script|cursive style]] evolved into ''[[hiragana]]'', or ''[[hiragana|onna-de]]'', that is, \"ladies' hand,\"<ref>Hadamitzky, Wolfgang and Spahn, Mark (2012), ''Kanji and Kana:  A Complete Guide to the Japanese Writing System'',  Third Edition, Rutland, VT:  Tuttle Publishing. {{ISBN|4805311169}}. p. 14.</ref> a writing system that was accessible to women (who were denied [[higher education]]). Major works of [[Heian-era]] [[literature]] by women were written in hiragana. ''[[Katakana]]'' emerged via a parallel path: [[monastery]] students simplified ''man'y\u014dgana'' to a single constituent element. Thus the two other writing systems, hiragana and katakana, referred to collectively as ''[[kana]]'', are descended from kanji. In comparison to kana (\u4eee\u540d, \"provisional character\") kanji are also called mana (\u771f\u540d, \"true name, true character\").\n\nIn modern Japanese, kanji are used to write parts of the language (usually [[content word]]s) such as [[noun]]s, [[adjective]] [[word stem|stems]], and [[verb]] [[word stem|stems]], while hiragana are used to write [[inflection|inflected]] verb and adjective endings and as [[phonetic complement]]s to disambiguate readings (''[[okurigana]]''), [[grammatical particle|particles]], and miscellaneous words which have no kanji or whose kanji is considered obscure or too difficult to read or remember. [[Katakana]] are mostly used for representing [[onomatopoeia]], [[gairaigo|non-Japanese loanwords]] (except those borrowed from [[Old Chinese|ancient Chinese]]), the names of plants and animals (with exceptions), and for emphasis on certain words.\n\n==Orthographic reform and lists of kanji==\n{{Main|Japanese script reform}}\n[[File:Y\u014dsh\u016b Chikanobu Shin Bijin No. 20.jpg|thumb|left|A young woman practicing kanji.

Many variant forms of characters and obscure alternatives for common characters were officially discouraged.\n\nThese are simply guidelines, so many characters outside these standards are still widely known and commonly used; these are known as {{Nihongo||\u8868\u5916\u5b57|[[hy\u014dgaiji]]}}.\n\n===Ky\u014diku kanji===\n{{Main|Ky\u014diku kanji}}\nThe {{Nihongo||\u6559\u80b2\u6f22\u5b57|ky\u014diku kanji|{{abbr|lit.|literally}} \"education kanji\"}} are 1,006 characters that Japanese children learn in elementary school. Originally the list only contained 881 characters. This was expanded to 996 characters in 1977. It was not until 1982 the list was expanded to its current size. The grade-level breakdown of these kanji is known as the {{Nihongo||\u5b66\u5e74\u5225\u6f22\u5b57\u914d\u5f53\u8868|gakunen-betsu kanji hait\u014dhy\u014d}}, or the ''gakush\u016b kanji''.

The ''j\u014dy\u014d kanji'' were introduced in 1981, replacing an older list of 1,850 characters known as the {{Nihongo||\u5f53\u7528\u6f22\u5b57|[[t\u014dy\u014d kanji]]|general-use kanji}}, introduced in 1946. Originally numbering 1,945 characters, the ''j\u014dy\u014d kanji'' list was expanded to 2,136 in 2010. Some of the new characters were previously ''Jinmeiy\u014d kanji''; some are used to write prefecture names: {{Nihongo2|\u962a}}, {{Nihongo2|\u718a}}, {{Nihongo2|\u5948}}, {{Nihongo2|\u5ca1}}, {{Nihongo2|\u9e7f}}, {{Nihongo2|\u68a8}}, {{Nihongo2|\u961c}}, {{Nihongo2|\u57fc}}, {{Nihongo2|\u8328}}, {{Nihongo2|\u6803}} and {{Nihongo2|\u5a9b}}.\n\n===Jinmeiy\u014d kanji===\n{{Main|Jinmeiy\u014d kanji}}\nAs of September 25, 2017, the {{Nihongo||\u4eba\u540d\u7528\u6f22\u5b57|jinmeiy\u014d kanji|kanji for use in personal names}} consists of 863 characters. Kanji on this list are mostly used in people's names and some are traditional variants of ''j\u014dy\u014d kanji''. There were only 92 kanji in the original list published in 1952, but new additions have been made frequently. Sometimes the term ''jinmeiy\u014d kanji'' refers to all 2,999 kanji from both the ''j\u014dy\u014d'' and ''jinmeiy\u014d'' lists combined.\n\n===Hy\u014dgai kanji===\n{{Main|Hy\u014dgai kanji}}\n{{Nihongo||\u8868\u5916\u6f22\u5b57|Hy\u014dgai kanji|\"unlisted characters\"}} are any kanji not contained in the ''j\u014dy\u014d kanji'' and ''jinmeiy\u014d kanji'' lists.

From the reader's point of view, kanji are said to have one or more different \"readings\". Although more than one reading may become activated in the brain,<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/17470218.2013.773050|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236062398_The_multiple_pronunciations_of_Japanese_kanji_A_masked_priming_investigation| pmid = 23510000| title = The multiple pronunciations of Japanese kanji: A masked priming investigation| journal = The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology| volume = 66| issue = 10| pages = 2023| year = 2013| last1 = Verdonschot | first1 = R.

O. }}</ref> deciding which reading is appropriate depends on recognizing which word it represents, which can usually be determined from context, intended meaning, whether the character occurs as part of a compound word or an independent word, and sometimes location within the sentence. For example, {{lang|ja|\u4eca\u65e5}} is usually read ''ky\u014d'', meaning \"today\", but in formal writing is instead read ''konnichi'', meaning \"nowadays\"; this is understood from context. Nevertheless, some cases are ambiguous and require a ''[[furigana]]'' gloss, which are also used simply for difficult readings or to specify a non-standard reading.\n\nKanji readings are categorized as either ''on'yomi'' (literally \"sound reading\", from Chinese) or ''kun'yomi'' (literally \"meaning reading\", native Japanese), and most characters have at least two readings, at least one of each. However, some characters have only a single reading, such as {{Nihongo||\u83ca|kiku|\"chrysanthemum\", an ''on''-reading}} or {{Nihongo||\u9c2f|iwashi|\"sardine\", a ''kun''-reading}}; ''kun''-only are common for Japanese-coined kanji (''kokuji''). Some common kanji have ten or more possible readings; the most complex common example is {{Nihongo2|\u751f}}, which is read as ''sei, sh\u014d, nama, ki, o-u, i-kiru, i-kasu, i-keru, u-mu, u-mareru, ha-eru'', and ''ha-yasu'', totaling 8 basic readings (first 2 are ''on'', rest are ''kun''), or 12 if related verbs are counted as distinct; see [[Okurigana#\u751f|okurigana: \u751f]] for details.\n\nMost often, a character will be used for both sound and meaning, and it is simply a matter of choosing the correct reading based on which word it represents. In other cases, a character is used only for sound (''[[ateji]]''). In this case, pronunciation is still based on a standard reading, or used only for meaning (broadly a form of ''ateji'', narrowly ''jukujikun''). Therefore, only the full compound\u2014not the individual character\u2014has a reading. There are also [[#Special readings|special cases]] where the reading is completely different, often based on a historical or traditional reading.\n\nThe analogous phenomenon occurs to a much lesser degree in [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]], where there are [[literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters]]\u2014borrowed readings and native readings. In Chinese these borrowed readings and native readings are etymologically related, since they are between Chinese varieties (which are related), not from Chinese to Japanese (which are not related). They thus form [[Doublet (linguistics)|doublets]] and are generally similar, analogous to different on'yomi, reflecting different stages of Chinese borrowings into Japanese.\n\n===''On'yomi'' (Sino-Japanese reading) {{anchor|on'yomi|on-yomi|onyomi|on'yomi (Chinese reading)}} <!-- for redirects and direct links to older section names --> ===\nThe {{Nihongo||\u97f3\u8aad\u307f|'''on'yomi'''|{{IPA-ja|o\u0270\u0303jomi|}}, lit. \"sound(-based) reading\"}}, the [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese]] reading, is the modern descendant of the Japanese approximation of the base Chinese pronunciation of the character at the time it was introduced. It was often previously referred to as '''translation reading''', as it was recreated readings of the Chinese pronunciation but was not the Chinese pronunciation or reading itself, similar to the English pronunciation of Latin loanwords. Old Japanese scripts often stated that ''on'yomi'' readings were also created by the Japanese during their arrival and re-borrowed by the Chinese as their own. There also exist kanji created by the Japanese and given an ''on'yomi'' reading despite not being a Chinese-derived or a Chinese-originating character. Some kanji were introduced from different parts of China at different times, and so have multiple ''on'yomi'', and often multiple meanings. ''Kanji'' invented in Japan would not normally be expected to have ''on'yomi'', but there are exceptions, such as the character {{Nihongo2|\u50cd}} \"to work\", which has the ''kun'yomi'' \"''hataraku''\" and the ''on'yomi'' \"''d\u014d''\", and {{Nihongo2|\u817a}} \"gland\", which has only the ''on'yomi'' \"''sen''\"\u2014in both cases these come from the ''on'yomi'' of the phonetic component, respectively {{Nihongo2|\u52d5}} \"''d\u014d''\" and {{Nihongo2|\u6cc9}} \"''sen''\".\n\nGenerally, ''on'yomi'' are classified into four types according to their region and time of origin:\n*{{Nihongo||\u5449\u97f3|'''[[Go-on]]'''|\"Wu sound\"}} readings are from the pronunciation during the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]] of China during the 5th and 6th centuries. ''Go'' refers to the [[Wu (region)|Wu]] region (in the vicinity of modern [[Shanghai]]), which still maintains linguistic similarities with modern Sino-Japanese vocabulary. See also: [[Wu Chinese]] and [[Shanghainese language]].\n*{{Nihongo||\u6f22\u97f3|'''[[Kan-on]]'''|\"Han sound\"}} readings are from the pronunciation during the [[Tang dynasty]] of China in the 7th to 9th centuries, primarily from the standard speech of the capital, [[Chang'an]] (modern [[Xi'an]]). Here, ''Kan'' refers to [[Han Chinese|Han Chinese people]] or [[China proper]].\n*{{Nihongo||\u5510\u97f3|'''[[T\u014d-on]]'''|\"Tang sound\"}} readings are from the pronunciations of later dynasties of China, such as the [[Song dynasty|Song]] and [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]. They cover all readings adopted from the [[Heian era]] to the [[Edo period]]. This is also known as {{Nihongo||\u5510\u5b8b\u97f3|T\u014ds\u014d-on|Tang and Song sound}}.\n*{{anchor|kan'y\u014d-on|kan'y\u014don|kan'you-on}} {{Nihongo||\u6163\u7528\u97f3|'''Kan'y\u014d-on'''|\"customary sound\"}} readings, which are mistaken or changed readings of the kanji that have become accepted into the Japanese language. In some cases, they are the actual readings that accompanied the character's introduction to Japan, but do not match how the character [[linguistic prescription|\"should\"]] (is prescribed to) be read according to the rules of character construction and pronunciation.\n\n{| class=\"infobox\" align=\"right\"\n|+ Examples <small>(rare readings in parentheses)</small>\n|-\n!

The ''go-on'' readings are especially common in [[Buddhist]] terminology such as {{Nihongo||\u6975\u697d|gokuraku|paradise}}, as well as in some of the earliest loans, such as the Sino-Japanese numbers. The ''t\u014d-on'' readings occur in some later words, such as {{Nihongo||\u6905\u5b50|isu|chair}}, {{Nihongo||\u5e03\u56e3|[[futon]]|mattress}}, and {{Nihongo||\u884c\u706f|andon|a kind of paper lantern}}. The go-on, kan-on, and t\u014d-on readings are generally [[cognate]] (with rare exceptions of homographs; see below), having a common origin in [[Old Chinese]], and hence form [[doublet (linguistics)|linguistic doublets]] or triplets, but they can differ significantly from each other and from modern Chinese pronunciation.\n\nIn Chinese, most characters are associated with a single Chinese sound, though there are distinct [[literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters|literary and colloquial readings]]. However, some homographs ({{lang|zh|\u591a\u97f3\u5b57}} {{zh|p=du\u014dy\u012bnz\u00ec}}) such as {{lang|zh|\u884c}} (''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|h\u00e1ng}}'' or ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|x\u00edng}}'') (Japanese: ''an, g\u014d, gy\u014d'')<!--in go'on. in kan'on, both are ''k\u014d''--> have more than one reading in Chinese representing different meanings, which is reflected in the carryover to Japanese as well. Additionally, many Chinese syllables, especially those with an [[entering tone]], did not fit the largely consonant-vowel (CV) [[phonotactics]] of classical Japanese. Thus most ''on'yomi'' are composed of two [[Mora (linguistics)|morae]] (beats), the second of which is either a lengthening of the vowel in the first mora (to ''ei'', ''\u014d'', or ''\u016b''), the vowel ''i''<!--eg. ''ai'', ''sui''-->, or one of the syllables ''ku'', ''ki'', ''tsu'', ''chi'', ''fu'' (historically, later merged into ''\u014d''), or moraic ''n'', chosen for their approximation to the final consonants of Middle Chinese. It may be that [[Y\u014don|palatalized consonants before vowels other than ''i'']] developed in Japanese as a result of Chinese borrowings, as they are virtually unknown in words of native Japanese origin, but are common in Chinese.\n\n''On'yomi'' primarily occur in {{nihongo|multi-kanji compound words|\u719f\u8a9e|jukugo}} words, many of which are the result of the adoption, along with the kanji themselves, of Chinese words for concepts that either did not exist in Japanese or could not be articulated as elegantly using native words. This borrowing process is often compared to the [[List of English words with dual French and Anglo-Saxon variations|English borrowings from Latin, Greek, and Norman French]], since Chinese-borrowed terms are often more specialized, or considered to sound more erudite or formal, than their native counterparts (occupying a higher [[linguistic register]]).  The major exception to this rule is [[Japanese family name|family name]]s, in which the native ''kun'yomi'' are usually used (though ''on'yomi'' are found in many personal names, especially men's names).\n\n=== ''Kun'yomi'' (native reading)  {{anchor|kun'yomi|kun-yomi|kunyomi|Japanese reading|native reading}} ===\nThe {{Nihongo||\u8a13\u8aad\u307f|'''kun'yomi'''|{{IPA-ja|k\u026f\u0270\u0303jomi|}}, {{abbr|lit.|literally}} \"meaning reading\"}}, the native reading, is a reading based on the pronunciation of a native [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word, or ''[[yamato kotoba]]'', that closely approximated the meaning of the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] character when it was introduced. As with ''on'yomi'', there can be multiple ''kun'yomi'' for the same kanji, and some kanji have no ''kun'yomi'' at all.\n\nFor instance, the character for [[east]], {{Nihongo2|[[wikt:\u6771|\u6771]]}}, has the ''on'yomi'' ''t\u014d'', from [[Middle Chinese]] ''{{IPA|tung}}''. However, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] already had two words for \"east\": ''higashi'' and ''azuma''. Thus the kanji {{lang|ja|\u6771}} had the latter readings added as ''kun'yomi''. In contrast, the kanji {{lang|ja|[[Cun (length)|\u5bf8]]}}, denoting a Chinese unit of measurement (about 30&nbsp;mm or 1.2&nbsp;inch), has no native [[Japanese language|Japanese]] equivalent; it only has an ''on'yomi'', ''[[Cun (length)|sun]]'', with no native ''kun'yomi''. Most ''[[kokuji]]'', Japanese-created Chinese characters, only have ''kun'yomi'', although some have back-formed a pseudo-''on'yomi'' by analogy with similar characters, such as {{Nihongo2|\u50cd}} ''d\u014d'', from {{Nihongo2|\u52d5}} ''d\u014d'', and there are even some, such as {{Nihongo2|\u817a}} ''sen'' \"gland\", that have only an ''on'yomi''.\n\n''Kun'yomi'' are characterized by the strict (C)V syllable structure of ''yamato kotoba''. Most noun or adjective ''kun'yomi'' are two to three syllables long, while verb ''kun'yomi'' are usually between one and three syllables in length, not counting trailing [[hiragana]] called ''[[okurigana]]''. ''Okurigana'' are not considered to be part of the internal reading of the character, although they are part of the reading of the word. A beginner in the language will rarely come across characters with long readings, but readings of three or even four syllables are not uncommon. This contrasts with ''on'yomi'', which are monosyllabic, and is unusual in the [[Chinese family of scripts]], which generally use one character per syllable\u2014not only in Chinese, but also in Korean, Vietnamese, and Zhuang; [[polysyllabic Chinese character]]s are rare and considered non-standard.\n\n{{Nihongo2|\u627f\u308b}} ''uketamawaru'',  {{Nihongo2|\u5fd7}} ''kokorozashi'', and {{Nihongo2|\u8a54}} ''mikotonori'' have five syllables represented by a single kanji, the longest readings in the [[J\u014dy\u014d kanji|''j\u014dy\u014d'' character set]]. These unusually long readings are due to a single character representing a compound word:\n\n* {{lang|ja|\u627f\u308b}} is a single character for a compound verb, one component of which has a long reading.\n** It has an alternative spelling as {{lang|ja|\u53d7\u3051\u8cdc\u308b}} ''u(ke)-tamawa(ru)'', hence (1+1)+3=5.\n** Compare common {{lang|ja|\u53d7\u3051\u4ed8\u3051\u308b}} ''u(ke)-tsu(keru)''.\n* {{lang|ja|\u5fd7}} is a nominalization of the verb {{lang|ja|\u5fd7\u3059}} which has a long reading ''kokoroza(su)''.\n** This is due to its being derived from a noun-verb compound, {{lang|ja|\u5fc3\u6307\u3059}} ''kokoro-za(su)''.\n** The nominalization removes the okurigana, hence increasing the reading by one mora, yielding 4+1=5.\n** Compare common {{lang|ja|\u8a71}} ''hanashi'' 2+1=3, from {{lang|ja|\u8a71\u3059}} ''hana(su)''.\n* {{lang|ja|\u8a54}} is a triple compound.\n** It has an alternative spelling {{lang|ja|\u5fa1\u8a00\u5ba3}} ''mi-koto-nori'', hence 1+2+2=5.\n\nLonger readings exist for non-J\u014dy\u014d characters and non-kanji symbols, where a long [[gairaigo]] word may be the reading (this is classed as ''kun'yomi''\u2014see [[#Single character gairaigo|single character gairaigo]], below)\u2014the character {{Nihongo2|\u7cce}} has the seven kana reading {{lang|ja-Kana|\u30bb\u30f3\u30c1\u30e1\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb}} ''senchim\u0113toru'' \"centimeter\", though it is generally written as \"cm\" (with two half-width characters, so occupying one space); another common example is '%' (the percent sign), which has the five kana reading {{lang|ja-Kana|\u30d1\u30fc\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8}} ''p\u0101sento''. Further, some J\u014dy\u014d characters have long non-J\u014dy\u014d readings (students learn the character, but not the reading), such as ''omonpakaru'' for {{lang|ja|\u616e\u308b}}.\n\nIn a number of cases, multiple kanji were assigned to cover a single [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word. Typically when this occurs, the different kanji refer to specific shades of meaning. For instance, the word {{lang|ja-Kana|\u306a\u304a\u3059}}, ''naosu'', when written {{lang|ja|\u6cbb\u3059}}, means \"to heal an illness or sickness\". When written {{lang|ja|\u76f4\u3059}} it means \"to fix or correct something\". Sometimes the distinction is very clear, although not always. Differences of opinion among reference works is not uncommon; one dictionary may say the kanji are equivalent, while another dictionary may draw distinctions of use. As a result, native speakers of the language may have trouble knowing which kanji to use and resort to personal preference or by writing the word in [[hiragana]]. This latter strategy is frequently employed with more complex cases such as \u3082\u3068 ''moto'', which has at least five different kanji: {{lang|ja|\u5143, \u57fa, \u672c, \u4e0b}}, and {{lang|ja|\u7d20}}, the first three of which have only very subtle differences. Another notable example is ''sakazuki'' \"sake cup\", which may be spelt as at least five different kanji: {{lang|ja|\u676f, \u76c3, \u5df5/\u536e}}, and {{lang|ja|\u574f}}; of these, the first two are common\u2014formally {{lang|ja|\u676f}} is a small cup and {{lang|ja|\u76c3}} a large cup.\n\nLocal dialectical readings of kanji are also classified under ''kun'yomi'', most notably readings for words in [[Ryukyuan languages]]. Further, in rare cases gairaigo (borrowed words) have a single character associated with them, in which case this reading is formally classified as a ''kun'yomi'', because the character is being used for meaning, not sound. This is discussed under [[#Single character gairaigo|single character gairaigo]], below.\n\n===Mixed readings {{anchor|j\u016bbako|juubako|jubako|yut\u014d|yutou|yuto}} ===\n[[File:J\u016bbako.jpg|thumb|A {{Nihongo||\u91cd\u7bb1|j\u016bbako}}, which has a mixed on-kun reading]]\n[[File:Pail,yutou,soba-yu,katori-city,japan.JPG|thumb|A {{Nihongo||\u6e6f\u6876|yut\u014d}}, which has a mixed kun-on reading]]\nThere are many kanji compounds that use a mixture of ''on'yomi'' and ''kun'yomi'', known as {{Nihongo||\u91cd\u7bb1\u8aad\u307f|j\u016bbako yomi|multi-layered food box}} or {{Nihongo||\u6e6f\u6876|yut\u014d|hot liquid pail}} words (depending on the order), which are themselves examples of this kind of compound (they are [[autological word]]s): the first character of ''j\u016bbako'' is read using ''on'yomi'', the second ''kun'yomi'' (''on-kun''). \nIt is the other way around with ''yut\u014d'' (''kun-on'').\n\nFormally, these are referred to as {{Nihongo||\u91cd\u7bb1\u8aad\u307f|j\u016bbako-yomi|''j\u016bbako'' reading}} and {{Nihongo||\u6e6f\u6876\u8aad\u307f|yut\u014d-yomi|''yut\u014d'' reading}}. Note that in both these words, the ''on'yomi'' has a long vowel; long vowels in Japanese generally are derived from sound changes common to loans from Chinese, hence distinctive of ''on'yomi''. These are the Japanese form of [[hybrid word]]s. Other examples include {{nihongo||\u5834\u6240|basho|\"place\", ''kun-on''}}, {{nihongo||\u91d1\u8272|kin'iro|\"golden\", ''on-kun''}} and {{nihongo||\u5408\u6c17\u9053|aikid\u014d|the martial art [[Aikido]]\", ''kun-on-on''}}.\n\n''Ateji'' often use mixed readings. For instance the city of [[Sapporo]], whose name derives from the [[Ainu language]] and has no meaning in Japanese, is written with the ''on-kun'' compound {{lang|ja|\u672d\u5e4c}} (which includes ''[[sokuon]]'' as if it were a purely ''on'' compound).\n\n===Special readings===\n{{nihongo||{{linktext|\u7fa9\u8a13}}|{{visible anchor|Gikun}}}} and {{nihongo||{{linktext|\u719f\u5b57\u8a13}}|{{visible anchor|jukujikun}}}} are readings of kanji combinations that have no direct correspondence to the characters' individual ''on'yomi'' or ''kun'yomi''. From the point of view of the character, rather than the word, this is known as a {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u96e3\u8a13}}|nankun|difficult reading}}, and these are listed in kanji dictionaries under the entry for the character.\n\n''Gikun'' are when kanji that are barely or even at all related to their readings in terms of meaning are used, such as using {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u5bd2}}}} meaning \"cold\" with reading ''fuyu'' (\"winter\"), rather than the standard character {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u51ac}}}}. These usages are typically non-standard and employed in specific contexts by individual writers, with few exceptions, such as the spelling of ''[[Asuka period|Asuka]]'', \u98db\u9ce5. Aided with [[furigana]], ''gikun'' could be used to convey complex literary or poetic effect (especially if the readings contradict the kanji), or clarification if the referent may not be obvious.\n\n''Jukujikun'' are when the standard kanji for a word are related to the meaning, but not the sound. The word is pronounced as a whole, not corresponding to sounds of individual kanji. For example, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u4eca\u671d}}}} (\"this morning\") is jukujikun, and read neither as *''ima'asa'', the ''kun'yomi'' of the characters, infrequently as ''konch\u014d'', the ''on'yomi'' of the characters, and not as any combination thereof. Instead it is read as ''kesa'', a native bisyllabic Japanese word that may be seen as a single [[morpheme]], or as a fusion of ''ky\u014d'' (previously ''kefu''), \"today\", and ''asa'', \"morning\". Likewise, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u4eca\u65e5}}}} (\"today\") is also jukujikun, usually read with the native reading ''ky\u014d''; its on'yomi, ''konnichi'', does occur in certain words and expressions, especially in the broader sense \"nowadays\" or \"current\", such as {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u4eca\u65e5\u7684}}}} (\"present-day\"), although in the phrase ''konnichi wa'' (\"good day\"), ''konnichi'' is typically spelled wholly with hiragana rather than with the kanji {{Nihongo2|\u4eca\u65e5}}.\n\nJukujikun are primarily used for some native Japanese words, such as [[Yamato (disambiguation)|Yamato]]<!-- intentional link to DAB page--> ({{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u5927\u548c}}}} or {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u502d}}}}, the name of a Japanese province as well as ancient name for Japan), and for some old borrowings, such as {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u67f3\u8449\u9b5a}}|[[shishamo]]|willow leaf fish}} from Ainu, {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u7159\u8349}}|tabako|smoke grass}} from Portuguese, or ''b\u012bru'' ({{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u9ea6\u9152}}}}, wheat alcohol) from Dutch, especially if the word was borrowed before the [[Meiji period|Meiji Period]]. Words whose kanji are jukujikun are often usually written as hiragana (if native), or katakana (if borrowed); some old borrowed words are also written as hiragana, especially Portuguese loanwords such as ''karuta'' ({{linktext|\u304b\u308b\u305f}}) from Portuguese \"carta\" (Eng: card), ''tempura'' ({{linktext|\u3066\u3093\u3077\u3089}}) from Portuguese \"tempora\", and ''pan'' ({{linktext|\u3071\u3093}}) from Spanish \"pan\" (Eng: bread), as well as ''tabako'' ({{linktext|\u305f\u3070\u3053}}).\n\nSometimes, jukujikun can even have more kanji than there are syllables, examples being ''kera'' ({{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u5544\u6728\u9ce5}}}}, woodpecker), ''gumi'' ({{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u80e1\u983d\u5b50}}}}, silver berry/oleaster),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/29056/how-many-possible-phonological-forms-could-be-represented-by-a-randomly-chosen-s|title=How many possible phonological forms could be represented by a randomly chosen single character?|website=japanese.stackexchange.com|access-date=2017-07-15}}</ref> and ''Hozumi'' ({{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u516b\u6708\u6714\u65e5}}}}, a surname).<ref name=\"How do Japanese names work\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/names-for-people.html|title=How do Japanese names work?|website=www.sljfaq.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-14}}</ref> This phenomenon is observed in animal names that are shortened and used as suffixes for zoological compound names, for example when {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u9ec4\u91d1\u866b}}}}, normally read as ''koganemushi'', is shortened to ''kogane'' in {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u9ed2\u9ec4\u91d1\u866b}}}} ''kurokogane'', although zoological names are commonly spelled with katakana rather than with kanji anyway. Outside zoology, this type of shortening only occurs on a handful of words, for example {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u5927\u5143\u5e25}}}} ''daigen(sui)'', or the historical male name suffix {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u53f3\u885b\u9580}}}} ''-emon'' which was shortened from the word ''uemon''.\n\nJukujikun are quite varied. Often the kanji compound for jukujikun is idiosyncratic and created for the word, and where the corresponding Chinese word does not exist; in other cases a kanji compound for an existing Chinese word is reused, where the Chinese word and ''on'yomi'' may or may not be used in Japanese; for example, {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u99b4\u9e7f}}||reindeer}} is jukujikun for ''tonakai'', from Ainu, but the ''on'yomi'' reading of ''junroku'' is also used. In some cases Japanese coinages have subsequently been [[Wasei-kango|borrowed back into  Chinese]], such as {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u9b9f\u9c47}}|ank\u014d|monkfish}}.\n\nThe underlying word for jukujikun is a native Japanese word or foreign borrowing, which either does not have an existing kanji spelling (either ''kun'yomi'' or ''ateji'') or for which a new kanji spelling is produced. Most often the word is a noun, which may be a simple noun (not a compound or derived from a verb), or may be a verb form or a fusional pronunciation; for example {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u76f8\u64b2}}|sum\u014d|[[sumo]]}} is originally from the verb {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u4e89\u3046}}|suma-u|to vie}}, while {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u4eca\u65e5}}|ky\u014d|today}} is fusional. In rare cases jukujikun is also applied to inflectional words (verbs and adjectives), in which case there is frequently a corresponding Chinese word.\n\nExamples of jukujikun for inflectional words follow. The most common example of a jukujikun adjective is {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u53ef\u611b\u3044}}|kawai-i|cute}}, originally ''kawayu-i;'' the word {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u53ef\u611b}}}} is used in Chinese, but the corresponding ''on'yomi'' is not used in Japanese. By contrast, \"appropriate\" can be either {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u76f8\u5fdc\u3057\u3044}}|fusawa-shii|in jukujikun}} or {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u76f8\u5fdc}}|s\u014d\u014d|in ''on'yomi''}} are both used; the ''-shii'' ending is because these were formerly a different class of adjectives. A common example of a verb with jukujikun is {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u6d41\u884c\u308b}}|haya-ru|to spread, to be in vogue}}, corresponding to ''on'yomi'' {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u6d41\u884c}}|ry\u016bk\u014d}}. A sample jukujikun deverbal (noun derived from a verb form) is {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u5f37\u8acb}}|yusuri|extortion}}, from {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u5f37\u8acb\u308b}}|yusu-ru|to extort}}, spelling from {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u5f37\u8acb}}|ky\u014dsei|extortion}}. See [[:ja:\u7fa9\u8a13#\u7fa9\u8a13|\u7fa9\u8a13]] and [[:ja:\u719f\u5b57\u8a13|\u719f\u5b57\u8a13]] for many more examples. Note that there are also compound verbs and, less commonly, compound adjectives, and while these may have multiple kanji without intervening characters, they are read using usual ''kun'yomi;'' examples include {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u9762\u767d\u3044}}|omo-shiro-i|interesting|face-whitening}} and {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u72e1\u8ce2\u3044}}|zuru-gashiko-i|sly}}.\n\nTypographically, the [[furigana]] for jukujikun are often written so they are centered across the entire word, or for inflectional words over the entire root\u2014corresponding to the reading being related to the entire word\u2014rather than each part of the word being centered over its corresponding character, as is often done for the usual phono-semantic readings.\n\nBroadly speaking, jukujikun can be considered a form of ''[[ateji]]'', though in narrow usage \"ateji\" refers specifically to using characters for sound and not meaning (sound-spelling), rather than meaning and not sound (meaning-spelling), as in jukujikun.\n\nMany jukujikun (established meaning-spellings) began life as gikun (improvised meaning-spellings). Occasionally a single word will have many such kanji spellings; an extreme example is {{nihongo|||hototogisu|[[Lesser Cuckoo|lesser cuckoo]]}}, which may be spelt in a great many ways, including {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u675c\u9d51}}}}, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u6642\u9ce5}}}}, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u5b50\u898f}}}}, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u4e0d\u5982\u5e30}}}}, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u970d\u516c\u9ce5}}}}, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u8700\u9b42}}}},  {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u6c93\u624b\u9ce5}}}}, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u675c\u5b87}}}},{{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u7530\u9d51}}}}, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u6c93\u76f4\u9ce5}}}}, and {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u90ed\u516c}}}}\u2014many of these variant spellings are particular to [[haiku]] poems.\n\n===Single character gairaigo===\nIn some rare cases, an individual kanji has a reading that is borrowed from a modern foreign language ([[gairaigo]]), though most often these words are written in katakana. Notable examples include {{nihongo||\u9801\u3001\u30da\u30fc\u30b8|p\u0113ji|page}}, {{nihongo||\u91e6\uff0f\u9215\u3001\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3|botan|button}}, {{nihongo||\u96f6\u3001\u30bc\u30ed|zero|zero}}, and {{nihongo||\u7c73\u3001\u30e1\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb|m\u0113toru|meter}}. See [[wikt:Appendix:Single character gairaigo|list of single character gairaigo]] for more. These are classed as ''kun'yomi'' of a single character, because the character is being used for meaning only (without the Chinese pronunciation), rather than as [[ateji]], which is the classification used when a gairaigo term is written as a compound (2 or more characters). However, unlike the vast majority of other ''kun'yomi'', these readings are not native Japanese, but rather borrowed, so the \"kun'yomi\" label can be misleading. The readings are also written in katakana, unlike the usual hiragana for native ''kun'yomi''. Note that most of these characters are for units, particularly [[International System of Units#Chinese and Japanese|SI units]], in many cases using new characters ([[kokuji]]) coined during the [[Meiji period]], such as {{nihongo||\u7c81\u3001\u30ad\u30ed\u30e1\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb|kirom\u0113toru|kilometer, {{Nihongo2|\u7c73}} \"meter\" + {{Nihongo2|\u5343}} \"thousand\"}}.\n\n===Other readings===\nSome kanji also have lesser-known readings called ''[[nanori]]'' ({{Nihongo2|\u540d\u4e57\u308a}}), which are mostly used for names (often [[given name]]s) and in general, are closely related to the ''kun'yomi''. Place names sometimes also use ''nanori'' or, occasionally, unique readings not found elsewhere.\n\nFor example, there is the surname {{lang|ja|\u5c0f\u9ce5\u904a}} (literally, \"little birds at play\") that implies there are no predators, such as hawks, present. Pronounced, \"''kotori asobu''\". The name then can also mean {{lang|ja|\u9df9\u304c\u3044\u306a\u3044}} (''taka ga inai'', literally, \"no hawks around\") and it can be shortened to be pronounced as ''Takanashi''.<ref>[http://myoji-yurai.net/searchResult.htm?myojiKanji=\u5c0f\u9ce5\u904a {{Nihongo2|\u3010\u540d\u5b57\u3011\u5c0f\u9ce5\u904a}}]</ref>\n\n===When to use which reading===\nAlthough there are general rules for when to use ''on'yomi'' and when to use ''kun'yomi'', the language is littered with exceptions, and it is not always possible for even a native speaker to know how to read a character without prior knowledge (this is especially true for names, both of people and places); further, a given character may have multiple ''kun'yomi'' or ''on'yomi''. When reading Japanese, one primarily recognizes ''words'' (multiple characters and okurigana) and their readings, rather than individual characters, and only guess readings of characters when trying to \"sound out\" an unrecognized word.\n\nHomographs exist, however, which can sometimes be deduced from context, and sometimes cannot, requiring a glossary.  For example, {{Nihongo2|\u4eca\u65e5}} may be read either as ''ky\u014d'' \"today (informal)\" (special fused reading for native word) or as ''konnichi'' \"these days (formal)\" (''on'yomi''); in formal writing this will generally be read as ''konnichi''. In some cases multiple readings are common, as in {{Nihongo2|\u8c5a\u6c41}} \"pork soup\", which is commonly pronounced both as ''ton-jiru'' (mixed ''on-kun'') and ''buta-jiru'' (''kun-kun''), with ''ton'' somewhat more common nationally. Inconsistencies abound\u2014for example {{Nihongo2|\u725b\u8089}} ''gy\u016b-niku'' \"beef\" and {{Nihongo2|\u7f8a\u8089}} ''y\u014d-niku'' \"mutton\" have ''on-on'' readings, but {{Nihongo2|\u8c5a\u8089}} ''buta-niku'' \"pork\" and {{Nihongo2|\u9d8f\u8089}} ''tori-niku'' \"poultry\" have ''kun-on'' readings.\n\nThe main guideline is that a single kanji followed by ''okurigana'' (hiragana characters that are part of the word)\u2014as used in native verbs and adjectives\u2014''always'' indicates ''kun'yomi'', while kanji compounds (kango) usually use ''on'yomi'', which is usually ''kan-on;'' however, other ''on'yomi'' are also common, and ''kun'yomi'' are also commonly used in kango. For a kanji in isolation without okurigana, it is typically read using their ''kun'yomi'', though there are numerous exceptions. For example, {{Nihongo2|\u9244}} \"iron\" is usually read with the ''on'yomi'' ''tetsu'' rather than the ''kun'yomi'' ''kurogane''. Chinese ''on'yomi'' which are not the common ''kan-on'' reading are a frequent cause of difficulty or mistakes when encountering unfamiliar words or for inexperienced readers, though skilled natives will recognize the word; a good example is {{Nihongo||\u89e3\u6bd2|ge-doku|detoxification, anti-poison}} (''go-on''), where {{Nihongo||\u89e3}} is usually instead read as ''kai''.\n\n[[Okurigana]] are used with ''kun'yomi'' to mark the inflected ending of a native verb or adjective, or by convention. Note that Japanese verbs and adjectives are [[closed class]], and do not generally admit new words (borrowed Chinese vocabulary, which are nouns, can form verbs by adding {{Nihongo||\u301c\u3059\u308b|-suru|to do}} at the end, and adjectives via {{Nihongo2|\u301c\u306e}} ''-no'' or {{Nihongo2|\u301c\u306a}} ''-na'', but cannot become native Japanese vocabulary, which inflect). For example: {{Nihongo2|\u8d64\u3044}} ''aka-i'' \"red\", {{Nihongo2|\u65b0\u3057\u3044}} ''atara-shii'' \"new\", {{Nihongo2|\u898b\u308b}} ''mi-ru'' \"(to) see\". Okurigana can be used to indicate which ''kun'yomi'' to use, as in {{Nihongo2|\u98df\u3079\u308b}} ''ta-beru'' versus {{Nihongo2|\u98df\u3046}} ''ku-u'' (casual), both meaning \"(to) eat\", but this is not always sufficient, as in {{Nihongo2|\u958b\u304f}}, which may be read as ''a-ku'' or ''hira-ku'', both meaning \"(to) open\". {{Nihongo2|\u751f}} is a particularly complicated example, with multiple ''kun'' and ''on'yomi''\u2014see [[Okurigana#\u751f|okurigana: \u751f]] for details. Okurigana is also used for some nouns and adverbs, as in {{Nihongo2|\u60c5\u3051}} ''nasake'' \"sympathy\",  {{Nihongo2|\u5fc5\u305a}} ''kanarazu'' \"invariably\", but not for {{Nihongo2|\u91d1}} ''kane'' \"money\", for instance. [[Okurigana]] is an important aspect of kanji usage in Japanese; see that article for more information on ''kun'yomi'' orthography\n\n{{anchor|jukugo|multi-kanji compound words}}\nKanji occurring in {{nihongo|compounds (multi-kanji words)|\u719f\u8a9e|jukugo}} are generally read using ''on'yomi'', especially for four-character compounds (''[[yojijukugo]]''). Though again, exceptions abound, for example, {{Nihongo2|\u60c5\u5831}} ''j\u014dh\u014d'' \"information\", {{Nihongo2|\u5b66\u6821}} ''gakk\u014d'' \"school\", and   {{Nihongo2|\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda}} ''shinkansen'' \"bullet train\" all follow this pattern. This isolated kanji versus compound distinction gives words for similar concepts completely different pronunciations. {{Nihongo2|\u5317}} \"north\" and {{Nihongo2|\u6771}} \"east\" use the ''kun'yomi'' ''kita'' and ''higashi'', being stand-alone characters, but {{Nihongo2|\u5317\u6771}} \"northeast\", as a compound, uses the ''on'yomi'' ''hokut\u014d''. This is further complicated by the fact that many kanji have more than one ''on'yomi'': {{Nihongo2|\u751f}} is read as ''sei'' in {{Nihongo2|\u5148\u751f}} ''sensei'' \"teacher\" but as ''sh\u014d'' in {{Nihongo2|\u4e00\u751f}} ''issh\u014d'' \"one's whole life\". Meaning can also be an important indicator of reading; {{Nihongo2|\u6613}} is read ''i'' when it means \"simple\", but as ''eki'' when it means \"divination\", both being ''on'yomi'' for this character.\n\nThese rules of thumb have many exceptions. ''Kun'yomi'' compound words are not as numerous as those with ''on'yomi'', but neither are they rare. Examples include {{Nihongo2|\u624b\u7d19}} ''tegami'' \"letter\", {{Nihongo2|\u65e5\u5098}} ''higasa'' \"parasol\", and the famous {{Nihongo2|\u795e\u98a8}} ''[[kamikaze]]'' \"divine wind\". Such compounds may also have okurigana, such as {{Nihongo2|\u7a7a\u63da\u3052}} (also written {{Nihongo2|\u5510\u63da\u3052}}) ''karaage'' \"Chinese-style fried chicken\" and {{Nihongo2|\u6298\u308a\u7d19}} ''[[origami]]'', although many of these can also be written with the okurigana omitted (for example, {{Nihongo2|\u7a7a\u63da}} or {{Nihongo2|\u6298\u7d19}}).\n\nSimilarly, some ''on'yomi'' characters can also be used as words in isolation: {{Nihongo2|\u611b}} ''ai'' \"love\", {{Nihongo2|\u7985}} ''[[Zen]]'', {{Nihongo2|\u70b9}} ''ten'' \"mark, dot\". Most of these cases involve kanji that have no ''kun'yomi'', so there can be no confusion, although exceptions do occur. Alone {{Nihongo2|\u91d1}} may be read as ''kin'' \"gold\" or as ''kane'' \"money, metal\"; only context can determine the writer's intended reading and meaning.\n\nMultiple readings have given rise to a number of [[homograph]]s, in some cases having different meanings depending on how they are read. One example is {{Nihongo2|\u4e0a\u624b}}, which can be read in three different ways: ''j\u014dzu'' (skilled), ''uwate'' (upper part), or ''kamite'' ([[Blocking (stage)#Stage directions|stage left/house right]]). In addition, {{Nihongo2|\u4e0a\u624b\u3044}} has the reading ''umai'' (skilled). More subtly, {{Nihongo2|\u660e\u65e5}} has three different readings, all meaning \"tomorrow\": ''ashita'' (casual), ''asu'' (polite), and ''my\u014dnichi'' (formal). [[Furigana]] (reading glosses) is often used to clarify any potential ambiguities.\n\nConversely, in some cases homophonous terms may be distinguished in writing by different characters, but not so distinguished in speech, and hence potentially confusing. In some cases when it is important to distinguish these in speech, the reading of a relevant character may be changed. For example, {{Nihongo2|\u79c1\u7acb}} (privately established, esp. school) and {{Nihongo2|\u5e02\u7acb}} (city established) are both normally pronounced ''shi-ritsu;'' in speech these may be distinguished by the alternative pronunciations ''watakushi-ritsu'' and ''ichi-ritsu''. More informally, in legal jargon {{Nihongo2|\u524d\u6587}} \"preamble\" and {{Nihongo2|\u5168\u6587}} \"full text\" are both pronounced ''zen-bun'', so {{Nihongo2|\u524d\u6587}} may be pronounced ''mae-bun'' for clarity, as in \"Have you memorized the preamble [not 'whole text'] of the constitution?\". As in these examples, this is primarily using a ''kun'yomi'' for one character in a normally ''on'yomi'' term.\n\nAs stated above, [[#Mixed readings|''j\u016bbako'' and ''yut\u014d'' readings]] are also not uncommon. Indeed, all four combinations of reading are possible: ''on-on'', ''kun-kun'', ''kun-on'' and ''on-kun''.\n\nSeveral famous place names, including [[names of Japan|those of Japan]] itself ({{Nihongo2|\u65e5\u672c}} ''Nihon'' or sometimes ''Nippon''), those of some cities such as [[Tokyo]] ({{Nihongo2|\u6771\u4eac}} ''T\u014dky\u014d'') and [[Kyoto]] ({{Nihongo2|\u4eac\u90fd}} ''Ky\u014dto''), and those of the main islands [[Honshu]] ({{Nihongo2|\u672c\u5dde}} ''Honsh\u016b''), [[Kyushu]] ({{Nihongo2|\u4e5d\u5dde}} ''Ky\u016bsh\u016b''), [[Shikoku]] ({{Nihongo2|\u56db\u56fd}} ''Shikoku''), and [[Hokkaido]] ({{Nihongo2|\u5317\u6d77\u9053}} ''Hokkaid\u014d'') are read with ''on'yomi''; however, the majority of Japanese place names are read with ''kun'yomi'': {{Nihongo2|\u5927\u962a}} ''\u014csaka'', {{Nihongo2|\u9752\u68ee}} ''[[Aomori Prefecture|Aomori]]'', {{Nihongo2|\u7bb1\u6839}} ''[[Hakone]]''. Names often use characters and readings that are not in common use outside of names. When characters are used as abbreviations of place names, their reading may not match that in the original. The [[Osaka]] ({{Nihongo2|\u5927\u962a}}) and [[Kobe]] ({{Nihongo2|\u795e\u6238}}) baseball team, the [[Hanshin Tigers|Hanshin]] ({{Nihongo2|\u962a\u795e}}) Tigers, take their name from the ''on'yomi'' of the second kanji of ''\u014csaka'' and the first of ''K\u014dbe''. The name of the [[Keisei Narita Airport Line|Keisei]] ({{Nihongo2|\u4eac\u6210}}) railway line\u2014linking Tokyo ({{Nihongo2|\u6771\u4eac}}) and [[Narita, Chiba|Narita]] ({{Nihongo2|\u6210\u7530}})\u2014is formed similarly, although the reading of {{Nihongo2|\u4eac}} from {{Nihongo2|\u6771\u4eac}} is ''kei'', despite ''ky\u014d'' already being an ''on'yomi'' in the word ''T\u014dky\u014d''.\n\n[[Japanese family name]]s are also usually read with ''kun'yomi'': {{Nihongo2|\u5c71\u7530}} ''Yamada'', {{Nihongo2|\u7530\u4e2d}} ''Tanaka'', {{Nihongo2|\u9234\u6728}} ''Suzuki''. Japanese [[given name]]s often have very irregular readings. Although they are not typically considered ''j\u016bbako'' or ''yut\u014d'', they often contain mixtures of ''kun'yomi'', ''on'yomi'' and ''nanori'', such as {{Nihongo2|\u5927\u52a9}} ''Daisuke'' [''on-kun''], {{Nihongo2|\u590f\u7f8e}} ''Natsumi'' [''kun-on'']. Being chosen at the discretion of the parents, the readings of given names do not follow any set rules, and it is impossible to know with certainty how to read a person's name without independent verification. Parents can be quite creative, and rumours abound of children called {{Nihongo2|\u5730\u7403}} ''\u0100su'' (\"Earth\") and {{Nihongo2|\u5929\u4f7f}} ''Enjeru'' (\"Angel\"); neither are common names, and have normal readings ''chiky\u016b'' and ''tenshi'' respectively. Some common Japanese names can be written in multiple ways, e.g. Akira can be written as {{Nihongo2|\u4eae}}, {{Nihongo2|\u5f70}}, {{Nihongo2|\u660e}}, {{Nihongo2|\u9855}}, {{Nihongo2|\u7ae0}}, {{Nihongo2|\u8074}}, {{Nihongo2|\u5149}}, {{Nihongo2|\u6676}}, {{Nihongo2|\u6644}}, {{Nihongo2|\u5f6c}}, {{Nihongo2|\u6636}}, {{Nihongo2|\u4e86}}, {{Nihongo2|\u79cb\u826f}}, {{Nihongo2|\u660e\u697d}}, {{Nihongo2|\u65e5\u65e5\u65e5}}, {{Nihongo2|\u4e9c\u7d00\u826f}}, {{Nihongo2|\u5b89\u559c\u826f}} and many other characters and kanji combinations not listed,<ref>{{Cite web|title = ateji Archives|url = http://www.tofugu.com/tag/ateji/|website = Tofugu|access-date = 2016-02-18|language = en-US|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151225050755/http://www.tofugu.com/tag/ateji|archive-date = December 25, 2015|url-status = dead}}</ref> Satoshi can be written as {{Nihongo2|\u8061}}, {{Nihongo2|\u54f2}}, {{Nihongo2|\u54f2\u53f2}}, {{Nihongo2|\u609f}}, {{Nihongo2|\u4f50\u767b\u53f2}}, {{Nihongo2|\u6681}}, {{Nihongo2|\u8a13}}, {{Nihongo2|\u54f2\u58eb}}, {{Nihongo2|\u54f2\u53f8}}, {{Nihongo2|\u654f}}, {{Nihongo2|\u8aed}}, {{Nihongo2|\u667a}}, {{Nihongo2|\u4f50\u767b\u53f8}}, {{Nihongo2|\u7e3d}}, {{Nihongo2|\u91cc\u53f2}}, {{Nihongo2|\u4e09\u5341\u56db}}, {{Nihongo2|\u4e86}}, {{Nihongo2|\u667a\u8a5e}}, etc.,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jisho.org/search/Satoshi|title=Satoshi |website=jisho.org|access-date=2016-03-05}}</ref> and Haruka can be written as {{Nihongo2|\u9065}}, {{Nihongo2|\u6625\u9999}}, {{Nihongo2|\u6674\u9999}}, {{Nihongo2|\u9065\u9999}}, {{Nihongo2|\u6625\u679c}}, {{Nihongo2|\u6674\u590f}}, {{Nihongo2|\u6625\u8cc0}}, {{Nihongo2|\u6625\u4f73}}, and several other possibilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jisho.org/search/Haruka|title=Haruka |website=jisho.org|access-date=2016-03-05}}</ref> Common patterns do exist, however, allowing experienced readers to make a good guess for most names. To alleviate any confusion on how to pronounce the names of other Japanese people, most official Japanese documents require Japanese to write their names in both kana and kanji.<ref name=\"How do Japanese names work\"/>\n\nChinese place names and [[Chinese personal name]]s appearing in Japanese texts, if spelled in kanji, are almost invariably read with ''on'yomi''. Especially for older and well-known names, the resulting Japanese pronunciation may differ widely from that used by modern Chinese speakers. For example, [[Mao Zedong]]'s name is pronounced as {{nihongo||\u6bdb\u6ca2\u6771|M\u014d Takut\u014d}} in Japanese, and the name of the legendary Monkey King, [[Sun Wukong]], is pronounced ''[[Son Goku (Journey to the West)|Son Gok\u016b]]'' ({{Nihongo2|\u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a}}) in Japanese.\n\nToday, Chinese names that are not well known in Japan are often spelled in [[katakana]] instead, in a form much more closely approximating the native Chinese pronunciation. Alternatively, they may be written in kanji with katakana furigana. Many such cities have names that come from non-[[Chinese language]]s like [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] or [[Manchu language|Manchu]]. Examples of such not-well-known Chinese names include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |English name\n! colspan=\"3\" |Japanese name\n|-\n!R\u014dmaji\n!Katakana\n!Kanji\n|-\n|Harbin\n|''Harubin''\n|\u30cf\u30eb\u30d3\u30f3\n|{{Nihongo2|\u54c8\u723e\u6d5c}}\n|-\n|\u00dcr\u00fcmqi\n|''Urumuchi''\n|\u30a6\u30eb\u30e0\u30c1\n|{{Nihongo2|\u70cf\u9b6f\u6728\u6589}}\n|-\n|Qiqihar\n|''Chichiharu''\n|\u30c1\u30c1\u30cf\u30eb\n|{{Nihongo2|\u6589\u6589\u54c8\u723e}}\n|-\n|Lhasa\n|''Rasa''\n|\u30e9\u30b5\n|{{Nihongo2|\u62c9\u85a9}}\n|}\nInternationally renowned Chinese-named cities tend to imitate the older English pronunciations of their names, regardless of the kanji's ''on'yomi'' or the Mandarin or Cantonese pronunciation, and can be written in either katakana or kanji.

It received this written [[Kaohsiung#Etymology and names|name]] (kanji/Chinese) from Japanese, and later its spoken Mandarin name from the corresponding characters. The English name \"Kaohsiung\" derived from its Mandarin pronunciation. Today it is pronounced either \u30ab\u30aa\u30b7\u30e5\u30f3 or \u30bf\u30ab\u30aa in Japanese.\n*Taipei is generally pronounced \u305f\u3044\u307b\u304f in Japanese.\n\nIn some cases the same kanji can appear in a given word with different readings. Normally this occurs when a character is duplicated and the reading of the second character has voicing (''[[rendaku]]''), as in {{lang|ja|\u4eba\u4eba}} ''hito-bito'' \"people\" (more often written with the [[iteration mark]] as {{Nihongo2|\u4eba\u3005}}), but in rare cases the readings can be unrelated, as in {{nihongo||\u8df3\u3073\u8df3\u306d\u308b|tobi-haneru|\"hop around\", more often written {{lang|ja|\u98db\u3073\u8df3\u306d\u308b}}}}.\n\n===Pronunciation assistance===\nBecause of the ambiguities involved, kanji sometimes have their pronunciation for the given context spelled out in [[ruby character]]s known as ''[[furigana]]'', (small ''[[kana]]'' written above or to the right of the character) or ''kumimoji'' (small ''kana'' written in-line after the character). This is especially true in texts for children or foreign learners. It is also used in [[newspaper]]s and ''[[manga]]'' (comics) for rare or unusual readings, or for situations like the first time a character's name is given, and for characters not included in the officially recognized set of [[j\u014dy\u014d kanji|essential kanji]]. Works of fiction sometimes use ''furigana'' to create new \"words\" by giving normal kanji non-standard readings, or to attach a foreign word rendered in katakana as the reading for a kanji or kanji compound of the same or similar meaning.\n\n===Spelling words===\nConversely, specifying a given kanji, or spelling out a kanji word\u2014whether the pronunciation is known or not\u2014can be complicated, due to the fact that there is not a commonly used standard way to refer to individual kanji (one does not refer to \"kanji #237\"), and that a given reading does not map to a single kanji\u2014indeed there are many homophonous ''words'', not simply individual characters, particularly for ''kango'' (with ''on'yomi''). Easiest is to write the word out\u2014either on paper or tracing it in the air\u2014or look it up (given the pronunciation) in a dictionary, particularly an electronic dictionary; when this is not possible, such as when speaking over the phone or writing implements are not available (and tracing in air is too complicated), various techniques can be used. These include giving ''kun'yomi'' for characters\u2014these are often unique\u2014using a well-known word with the same character (and preferably the same pronunciation and meaning), and describing the character via its components. For example, one may explain how to spell the word {{Nihongo||\u9999\u8f9b\u6599|k\u014dshinry\u014d|spice}} via the words {{Nihongo||\u9999\u308a|kao-ri|fragrance}}, {{Nihongo||\u8f9b\u3044|kara-i|spicy}}, and {{Nihongo||\u98f2\u6599|in-ry\u014d|beverage}}\u2014the first two use the ''kun'yomi'', the third is a well-known compound\u2014saying \"''kaori'', ''karai'', ''ry\u014d'' as in ''inry\u014d''.\"\n\n===Dictionaries===\nIn dictionaries, both words and individual characters have readings glossed, via various conventions. Native words and Sino-Japanese vocabulary are glossed in hiragana (for both ''kun'' and ''on'' readings), while borrowings (''gairaigo'')\u2014including modern borrowings from Chinese\u2014are glossed in katakana; this is the standard writing convention also used in furigana. By contrast, readings for individual characters are conventionally written in katakana for ''on'' readings, and hiragana for ''kun'' readings. Kun readings may further have a separator to indicate which characters are okurigana, and which are considered readings of the character itself. For example, in the entry for {{Nihongo2|\u98df}}, the reading corresponding to the basic verb {{Nihongo|''eat''|\u98df\u3079\u308b|taberu}} may be written as {{lang|ja-Kana|\u305f.\u3079\u308b}} (''ta.beru''), to indicate that ''ta'' is the reading of the character itself. Further, [[kanji dictionary|kanji dictionaries]] often list compounds including irregular readings of a kanji.\n\n==Local developments and divergences from Chinese==\nSince kanji are essentially Chinese ''[[hanzi]]'' used to write Japanese, the majority of characters used in modern Japanese still retain their Chinese meaning, physical resemblance with some of their modern [[traditional Chinese characters]] counterparts, and a degree of similarity with [[Classical Chinese]] pronunciation imported to Japan from 5th to 9th century. Nevertheless, after centuries of development, there is a notable number of kanji used in modern Japanese which have different meaning from ''hanzi'' used in modern Chinese. Such differences are the result of:\n* the use of characters created in Japan,\n* characters that have been given different meanings in Japanese, and \n* post-[[World War II]] simplifications (''[[shinjitai]]'') of the character.\n\nLikewise, the process of [[simplified characters|character simplification]] in [[mainland China]] since the 1950s has resulted in the fact that Japanese speakers who have not studied Chinese may not recognize some simplified characters.\n\n===Kokuji {{anchor|Wasei kanji}} ===\n{{see also|Gukja|Ch\u1eef N\u00f4m|Chinese family of scripts#Adaptations for other languages}}\nIn Japanese, {{nihongo||[[:ja:\u56fd\u5b57|\u56fd\u5b57]]|Kokuji|\"national characters\"}} refers to Chinese characters made outside of China. Specifically, kanji made in Japan are referred to as {{nihongo||\u548c\u88fd\u6f22\u5b57|Wasei kanji}}. They are primarily formed in the usual way of Chinese characters, namely by combining existing components, though using a combination that is not used in China. The corresponding phenomenon in Korea is called ''[[gukja]]'' ({{lang|ko|\u570b\u5b57}}), a cognate name; there are however far fewer Korean-coined characters than Japanese-coined ones. [[Chinese family of scripts#Adaptations for other languages|Other languages]] using the [[Chinese family of scripts]] sometimes have far more extensive systems of native characters, most significantly Vietnamese [[ch\u1eef N\u00f4m]], which comprises over 20,000 characters used throughout traditional Vietnamese writing, and [[Zhuang languages|Zhuang]] [[sawndip]], which comprises over 10,000 characters, which are still in use.\n\nSince kokuji are generally devised for existing native words, these usually only have native [[Kun reading#Kun'yomi (Japanese reading)|''kun'' readings]]. However, they occasionally have a Chinese [[On reading#On'yomi (Sino-Japanese reading)|''on'' reading]], derived from a phonetic, as in {{Nihongo2|\u50cd}}, ''d\u014d'', and in rare cases only have an ''on'' reading, as in {{Nihongo2|\u817a}}, ''sen'', from {{lang|ja|\u6cc9}}, which was derived for use in technical compounds ({{lang|ja|\u817a}} means \"gland\", hence used in medical terminology).\n\nThe majority of kokuji are [[Chinese character classification#Ideogrammatic compounds|ideogrammatic compounds]] ({{lang|ja|\u4f1a\u610f\u5b57}}), meaning that they are composed of two (or more) characters, with the meaning associated with the combination. For example, {{Nihongo2|\u50cd}} is composed of {{Nihongo2|\u4ebb}} (person radical) plus {{Nihongo2|\u52d5}} (action), hence \"action of a person, work\". This is in contrast to kanji generally, which are overwhelmingly phono-semantic compounds. This difference is because kokuji were coined to express Japanese words, so borrowing existing (Chinese) readings could not express these\u2014combining existing characters to logically express the meaning was the simplest way to achieve this. Other illustrative examples (below) include {{lang|ja|\u698a}} ''[[sakaki]]'' tree, formed as {{Nihongo2|\u6728}} \"tree\" and {{lang|ja|\u795e}} \"god\", literally \"divine tree\", and {{lang|ja|\u8fbb}} ''tsuji'' \"crossroads, street\" formed as {{lang|ja|\u8fb6}} ({{Nihongo2|\u2ecc}}) \"road\" and {{lang|ja|\u5341}} \"cross\", hence \"cross-road\".\n\nIn terms of meanings, these are especially for natural phenomena (esp. [[flora]] and [[fauna]] [[species]]) that were not present in ancient China, including a very large number of fish, such as {{Nihongo2|\u9c2f}} ([[sardine]]), {{Nihongo2|\u9c48}} ([[codfish]]), {{Nihongo2|\u9bb4}} ([[Perch (disambiguation)|seaperch]]), and {{Nihongo2|\u9c5a}} ([[sillago]]), and trees, such as {{Nihongo2|\u6a2b}} ([[evergreen oak]]), {{Nihongo2|\u6919}} ([[Japanese cedar]]), {{Nihongo2|\u691b}} ([[birch]], [[maple]]) and {{Nihongo2|\u67fe}} ([[spindle tree]]).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.tofugu.com/japanese/kokuji/?series=kanji|title=Kokuji: \"Made In Japan,\" Kanji Edition|last=Koichi|date=2012-08-21|work=Tofugu|access-date=2017-03-05|language=en-US}}</ref> In other cases they refer to specifically Japanese abstract concepts, everyday words (like {{Nihongo2|\u8fbb}}), or later technical coinages (such as {{Nihongo2|\u817a}}).\n\nThere are hundreds of ''kokuji'' in existence.<ref>{{citation | title = SLJ FAQ | url = http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/kokuji-list.html | chapter = Kokuji list}}.</ref>  Many are rarely used, but a number have become commonly used components of the written Japanese language.

(October 15, 1969) \"Some Observations on kokuji\" in ''The Journal-Newsletter of the Association of Teachers of Japanese'', Vol. 6, No. 2, pp. 45\u20139.</ref> have been introduced to China. In some cases the Chinese reading is the inferred Chinese reading, interpreting the character as a phono-semantic compound (as in how ''on'' readings are sometimes assigned to these characters in Chinese), while in other cases (such as {{Nihongo2|\u50cd}}), the Japanese ''on'' reading is borrowed (in general this differs from the modern Chinese pronunciation of this phonetic). Similar coinages occurred to a more limited extent in Korea and Vietnam.\n\nHistorically, some kokuji date back to very early Japanese writing, being found in the ''[[Man'y\u014dsh\u016b]]'', for example\u2014{{Nihongo2|\u9c2f}} ''iwashi'' \"sardine\" dates to the [[Nara period]] (8th century)\u2014while they have continued to be created as late as the late 19th century, when a number of characters were coined in the [[Meiji era]] for new scientific concepts. For example, some characters were produced as regular compounds for some (but not all) SI units, such as {{Nihongo2|\u7c81}} ({{Nihongo2|\u7c73}} \"meter\" + {{Nihongo2|\u5343}} \"thousand, kilo-\") for kilometer, {{Nihongo2|\u7acf}} ({{Nihongo2|\u7acb}} \"liter\" + {{Nihongo2|\u5343}} \"thousand, kilo-\") for kiloliter, and {{Nihongo2|\u74e9}} ({{Nihongo2|\u74e6}} \"gram\" + \"thousand, kilo-\") for kilogram\u2014see [[International System of Units#Chinese and Japanese|Chinese characters for SI units]] for details. However, SI units in Japanese today are almost exclusively written using r\u014dmaji or katakana such as {{Nihongo2|\u30ad\u30ed\u30e1\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb}} or {{Nihongo2|\u3316}} for km, {{Nihongo2|\u30ad\u30ed\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8\u30eb}} for kl, and {{Nihongo2|\u30ad\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0}} or {{Nihongo2|\u3315}} for kg.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/kokuji-list.html|title=A list of kokuji (\u56fd\u5b57)|website=www.sljfaq.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-05}}</ref>\n\nIn Japan the kokuji category is strictly defined as characters whose ''earliest'' appearance is in Japan. If a character appears earlier in the Chinese literature, it is not considered a kokuji even if the character was independently coined in Japan and unrelated to the Chinese character (meaning \"not borrowed from Chinese\"). In other words, kokuji are not simply characters that were made in Japan, but characters that were ''first'' made in Japan. An illustrative example is {{Nihongo||\u9b9f\u9c47|ank\u014d|[[monkfish]]}}. This spelling was created in Edo period Japan from the [[ateji]] (phonetic kanji spelling) {{Nihongo2|\u5b89\u5eb7}} for the existing word ''ank\u014d'' by adding the {{Nihongo2|\u9b5a}} radical to each character\u2014the characters were \"made in Japan\". However, {{Nihongo2|\u9b9f}} is not considered kokuji, as it is found in ancient Chinese texts as a corruption of {{lang|zh-hant|\u9c0b}} (\u9b5a\u533d). {{Nihongo2|\u9c47}} is considered kokuji, as it has not been found in any earlier Chinese text. Casual listings may be more inclusive, including characters such as {{Nihongo2|\u9b9f}}.<ref>[http://www.kanjijiten.net/japanese.html {{Nihongo2|\u56fd\u5b57}}] at [http://www.kanjijiten.net/ {{Nihongo2|\u6f22\u5b57\u8f9e\u5178\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8}}] demonstrates this, listing both {{Nihongo2|\u9b9f}} and {{Nihongo2|\u9c47}} as kokuji, but starring {{Nihongo2|\u9b9f}} and stating that dictionaries do not consider it to be a kokuji.</ref> Another example is {{Nihongo2|\u643e}}, which is sometimes not considered kokuji due to its earlier presence as a corruption of Chinese {{lang|zh-hant|\u69a8}}.\n\n===Kokkun===\nIn addition to ''kokuji'', there are kanji that have been given meanings in Japanese different from their original Chinese meanings. These are not considered ''kokuji'' but are instead called ''kok{{zwnj}}[[#kunyomi|kun]]'' ({{Nihongo2|\u56fd\u8a13}}) and include characters such as the following:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 |  {{abbr|Char.|Character (both Kanji and Hanzi)}} !! colspan=2 | Japanese !! colspan=22 | Chinese\n|-\n!

The traditional classification is still taught but is problematic and no longer the focus of modern lexicographic practice, as some categories are not clearly defined, nor are they mutually exclusive: the first four refer to structural composition, while the last two refer to usage.\n\n===''Sh\u014dkei moji'' ({{Nihongo2|\u8c61\u5f62\u6587\u5b57}})===\n''Sh\u014dkei'' (Mandarin: ''xi\u00e0ngx\u00edng'') characters are [[pictograph]]ic sketches of the object they represent. For example, {{Nihongo2|\u76ee}} is an eye, while {{Nihongo2|\u6728}} is a tree. The current forms of the characters are very different from the originals, though their representations are more clear in [[oracle bone script]] and [[seal script]]. These pictographic characters make up only a small fraction of modern characters.\n\n===''Shiji moji'' ({{Nihongo2|\u6307\u4e8b\u6587\u5b57}})===\n''Shiji'' (Mandarin: ''zh\u01d0sh\u00ec'') characters are [[ideograph]]s, often called \"simple ideographs\" or \"simple indicatives\" to distinguish them and tell the difference from compound ideographs (below). They are usually simple graphically and represent an abstract concept such as {{Nihongo2|\u4e0a}} \"up\" or \"above\" and {{Nihongo2|\u4e0b}} \"down\" or \"below\". These make up a tiny fraction of modern characters.\n\n===''Kaii moji'' ({{Nihongo2|\u4f1a\u610f\u6587\u5b57}})===\n''Kaii'' (Mandarin: ''hu\u00ecy\u00ec'') characters are compound ideographs, often called \"compound indicatives\", \"associative compounds\", or just \"ideographs\". These are usually a combination of pictographs that combine semantically to present an overall meaning. An example of this type is {{Nihongo2|\u4f11}} (rest) from {{Nihongo2|\u4ebb}} (person radical) and {{Nihongo2|\u6728}} (tree).  Another is the ''kokuji'' {{Nihongo2|\u5ce0}} (mountain pass) made from {{Nihongo2|\u5c71}} (mountain), {{Nihongo2|\u4e0a}} (up) and {{Nihongo2|\u4e0b}} (down). These make up a tiny fraction of modern characters.\n\n===''Keisei moji'' ({{Nihongo2|\u5f62\u58f0\u6587\u5b57}})===\n''Keisei'' (Mandarin: ''x\u00edngsh\u0113ng'') characters are phono-semantic or [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]]-phonetic compounds, sometimes called \"semantic-phonetic\", \"semasio-phonetic\", or \"phonetic-ideographic\" characters, are by far the largest category, making up about 90% of the characters in the standard lists; however, some of the most frequently used kanji belong to one of the three groups mentioned above, so ''keisei moji'' will usually make up less than 90% of the characters in a text. Typically they are made up of two components, one of which (most commonly, but by no means always, the left or top element) suggests the general category of the meaning or semantic context, and the other (most commonly the right or bottom element) approximates the pronunciation. The pronunciation relates to the original Chinese, and may now only be distantly detectable in the modern Japanese ''on'yomi'' of the kanji; it generally has no relation at all to ''kun'yomi''. The same is true of the semantic context, which may have changed over the centuries or in the transition from Chinese to Japanese. As a result, it is a common error in folk etymology to fail to recognize a phono-semantic compound, typically instead inventing a compound-indicative explanation.\n\n===''Tench\u016b moji'' ({{Nihongo2|\u8ee2\u6ce8\u6587\u5b57}})===\n''Tench\u016b'' (Mandarin: ''zhu\u01cenzh\u00f9'') characters have variously been called \"derivative characters\", \"derivative [[cognate]]s\", or translated as \"mutually explanatory\" or \"mutually synonymous\" characters; this is the most problematic of the six categories, as it is vaguely defined. It may refer to kanji where the meaning or application has become extended. For example, {{Nihongo2|\u697d}} is used for 'music' and 'comfort, ease', with different pronunciations in Chinese reflected in the two different ''on'yomi'', ''gaku'' 'music' and ''raku'' 'pleasure'.\n\n===''Kasha moji'' ({{Nihongo2|\u4eee\u501f\u6587\u5b57}})===\n''Kasha'' (Mandarin: ''ji\u01ceji\u00e8'') are [[rebus]]es, sometimes called \"phonetic loans\". The etymology of the characters follows one of the patterns above, but the present-day meaning is completely unrelated to this. A character was appropriated to represent a similar-sounding word. For example, {{Nihongo2|\u6765}} in ancient Chinese was originally a pictograph for \"wheat\". Its syllable was homophonous with the verb meaning \"to come\", and the character is used for that verb as a result, without any embellishing \"meaning\" element attached. The character for wheat {{Nihongo2|\u9ea6}}, originally meant \"to come\", being a ''keisei moji'' having 'foot' at the bottom for its meaning part and \"wheat\" at the top for sound. The two characters swapped meaning, so today the more common word has the simpler character. This borrowing of sounds has a very long history.\n\n==Related symbols==\n{{see also | Japanese typographic symbols}}\n\nThe [[iteration mark]] ({{Nihongo2|\u3005}}) is used to indicate that the preceding kanji is to be repeated, functioning similarly to a [[ditto mark]] in English. It is pronounced as though the kanji were written twice in a row, for example {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u8272\u3005}}|iroiro|\"various\"}} and {{Nihongo||\u6642\u3005|tokidoki|\"sometimes\"}}. This mark also appears in personal and place names, as in the [[Japanese name|surname]] Sasaki ({{lang|ja|\u4f50\u3005\u6728}}). This symbol is a simplified version of the kanji {{Nihongo2|\u4edd}}, a variant of {{Nihongo||\u540c|d\u014d|\"same\"}}.\n\nAnother abbreviated symbol is {{Nihongo2|[[\u30f6]]}}, in appearance a small [[katakana]] \"ke\", but actually a simplified version of the kanji {{Nihongo2|\u7b87}}, a general counter. It is pronounced \"ka\" when used to indicate quantity (such as {{lang|ja|\u516d\u30f6\u6708}}, ''rok'''ka'''getsu'' \"six months\") or \"ga\" in place names like {{Nihongo|[[Kasumigaseki]]|\u971e\u30f6\u95a2}}.\n\nThe way how these symbols may be produced on a computer depends on the operating system. In OS X, typing{{Nihongo2|\u300c\u3058\u304a\u304f\u308a\u300d}}will reveal the symbol {{Nihongo2|\u3005}} as well as {{Nihongo2|\u30fd}}, {{Nihongo2|\u309d}} and {{Nihongo2|\u309e}}. To produce {{Nihongo2|\u303b}}, type {{Nihongo2|\u300c\u304a\u3069\u308a\u3058\u300d}}. Under Windows, typing{{Nihongo2|\u300c\u304f\u308a\u304b\u3048\u3057\u300d}}will reveal some of these symbols, while in Google IME,{{Nihongo2|\u300c\u304a\u3069\u308a\u3058\u300d}}may be used.\n\n==Collation==\nKanji, whose thousands of symbols defy ordering by conventions such as those used for the [[Latin script]], are often [[collation|collated]] using the traditional Chinese [[radical-and-stroke sorting]] method. In this system, common components of characters are identified; these are called [[radical (Chinese character)|radicals]]. Characters are grouped by their primary radical, then ordered by number of pen strokes within radicals. For example, the kanji character {{Nihongo2|\u685c}}, meaning \"cherry\", is sorted as a ten-stroke character under the four-stroke primary radical {{lang|ja|\u6728}} meaning \"tree\". When there is no obvious radical or more than one radical, convention governs which is used for collation.\n\nOther kanji sorting methods, such as the [[Kodansha Kanji Learner's Dictionary#SKIP|SKIP]] system, have been devised by various authors.\n\nModern general-purpose [[Japanese dictionaries]] (as opposed to specifically character dictionaries) generally collate all entries, including words written using kanji, according to their [[kana]] representations (reflecting the way they are pronounced). The [[goj\u016bon]] ordering of kana is normally used for this purpose.\n\n==Kanji education==\n[[File:3002_Kanji.svg|thumb|An image that lists most joyo-kanji, according to [[Kodansha Kanji Learner's Dictionary|Halpern's KKLD indexing system]], with kyo-iku kanji color-coded by grade level.]]\n\nJapanese school children are expected to learn 1006 basic kanji characters, the ''[[ky\u014diku kanji]]'', before finishing the sixth grade. The order in which these characters are learned is fixed. The ''ky\u014diku kanji'' list is a subset of a larger list, originally of 1,945 kanji characters and extended to 2,136 in 2010, are known as the ''[[j\u014dy\u014d kanji]]''\u2014characters required for the level of fluency necessary to read newspapers and literature in Japanese. This larger list of characters is to be mastered by the end of the ninth grade.<ref>Halpern, J. (2006) ''The Kodansha Kanji Learner's Dictionary''. {{ISBN|1568364075}}. p. 38a.</ref> Schoolchildren learn the characters by repetition and [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]].\n\nStudents studying Japanese as a foreign language are often required by a curriculum to acquire kanji without having first learned the vocabulary associated with them. Strategies for these learners vary from copying-based methods to [[mnemonic]]-based methods such as those used in [[James Heisig]]'s series ''[[Remembering the Kanji]]''. Other textbooks use methods based on the [[etymology]] of the characters, such as Mathias and Habein's ''The Complete Guide to Everyday Kanji'' and Henshall's ''A Guide to Remembering Japanese Characters''. Pictorial [[mnemonics]], as in the text ''Kanji Pict-o-graphix'', are also seen.\n\nThe [[Japanese government]] provides the ''[[Kanji kentei]]'' ({{Nihongo2|\u65e5\u672c\u6f22\u5b57\u80fd\u529b\u691c\u5b9a\u8a66\u9a13}} ''Nihon kanji n\u014dryoku kentei shiken''; \"Test of Japanese Kanji Aptitude\"), which tests the ability to read and write kanji. The highest level of the ''Kanji kentei'' tests about six thousand kanji.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Braille kanji]]\n* [[Chinese influence on Japanese culture]]\n* [[Han unification]]\n* [[Han-Nom]] (Vietnamese equivalent)\n* [[Hanja]] (Korean equivalent)\n* [[Chinese family of scripts]]\n* [[Japanese script reform]]\n* [[Japanese typefaces]] (''shotai'')\n* [[Japanese writing system]]\n* [[Kanji of the year]]\n* [[List of kanji by concept]]\n* [[List of kanji by stroke count]]\n* [[POP (Point of Purchase typeface)]]\n* [[Radical (Chinese character)]]\n* [[Stroke order]]\n* [[Table of Japanese kanji radicals|Table of kanji radicals]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n* DeFrancis, John (1990).

Later, groups of people called ''fuhito'' were organized under the monarch to read and write [[Classical Chinese]]. During the reign of [[Empress Suiko]] (593\u2013628), the Yamato court began sending full-scale diplomatic missions to China, which resulted in a large increase in Chinese literacy at the Japanese court.<ref name=\"miyake9\" />\n\nIn ancient times paper was so rare that people stenciled kanji onto thin, rectangular strips of wood. These wooden boards were used for communication between government offices, tags for goods transported between various countries, and the practice of writing. The oldest written kanji in Japan discovered so far was written in ink on wood as a wooden strip dated to the 7th century. It is a record of trading for cloth and salt.<ref>{{Cite web| title =Kanji History in Japan| url = https://ateliers-japon.com/#home | publisher=Les Ateliers de Japon}}</ref><sup>[''No longer mentioned in source'']</sup>\n\nThe Japanese language had no written form at the time Chinese characters were introduced, and texts were written and read only in Chinese. Later, during the [[Heian period]] (794\u20131185), however, a system known as ''[[kanbun]]'' emerged, which involved using Chinese text with [[diacritical mark]]s to allow Japanese speakers to restructure and read Chinese sentences, by changing word order and adding particles and verb endings, in accordance with the rules of [[Japanese grammar]].\n\nChinese characters also came to be used to write Japanese words, resulting in the modern kana syllabaries. Around 650 AD, a writing system called ''[[man'y\u014dgana]]'' (used in the ancient poetry anthology ''[[Man'y\u014dsh\u016b]]'') evolved that used a number of Chinese characters for their sound, rather than for their meaning. Man'y\u014dgana written in [[Grass script|cursive style]] evolved into ''[[hiragana]]'', or ''[[hiragana|onna-de]]'', that is, \"ladies' hand,\"<ref>Hadamitzky, Wolfgang and Spahn, Mark (2012), ''Kanji and Kana:  A Complete Guide to the Japanese Writing System'',  Third Edition, Rutland, VT:  Tuttle Publishing. {{ISBN|4805311169}}. p. 14.</ref> a writing system that was accessible to women (who were denied [[higher education]]). Major works of [[Heian-era]] [[literature]] by women were written in hiragana. ''[[Katakana]]'' emerged via a parallel path: [[monastery]] students simplified ''man'y\u014dgana'' to a single constituent element. Thus the two other writing systems, hiragana and katakana, referred to collectively as ''[[kana]]'', are descended from kanji. In comparison to kana (\u4eee\u540d, \"provisional character\") kanji are also called mana (\u771f\u540d, \"true name, true character\").\n\nIn modern Japanese, kanji are used to write parts of the language (usually [[content word]]s) such as [[noun]]s, [[adjective]] [[word stem|stems]], and [[verb]] [[word stem|stems]], while hiragana are used to write [[inflection|inflected]] verb and adjective endings and as [[phonetic complement]]s to disambiguate readings (''[[okurigana]]''), [[grammatical particle|particles]], and miscellaneous words which have no kanji or whose kanji is considered obscure or too difficult to read or remember. [[Katakana]] are mostly used for representing [[onomatopoeia]], [[gairaigo|non-Japanese loanwords]] (except those borrowed from [[Old Chinese|ancient Chinese]]), the names of plants and animals (with exceptions), and for emphasis on certain words.\n\n==Orthographic reform and lists of kanji==\n{{Main|Japanese script reform}}\n[[File:Y\u014dsh\u016b Chikanobu Shin Bijin No. 20.jpg|thumb|left|A young woman practicing kanji.

Many variant forms of characters and obscure alternatives for common characters were officially discouraged.\n\nThese are simply guidelines, so many characters outside these standards are still widely known and commonly used; these are known as {{Nihongo||\u8868\u5916\u5b57|[[hy\u014dgaiji]]}}.\n\n===Ky\u014diku kanji===\n{{Main|Ky\u014diku kanji}}\nThe {{Nihongo||\u6559\u80b2\u6f22\u5b57|ky\u014diku kanji|{{abbr|lit.|literally}} \"education kanji\"}} are 1,006 characters that Japanese children learn in elementary school. Originally the list only contained 881 characters. This was expanded to 996 characters in 1977. It was not until 1982 the list was expanded to its current size. The grade-level breakdown of these kanji is known as the {{Nihongo||\u5b66\u5e74\u5225\u6f22\u5b57\u914d\u5f53\u8868|gakunen-betsu kanji hait\u014dhy\u014d}}, or the ''gakush\u016b kanji''.

The ''j\u014dy\u014d kanji'' were introduced in 1981, replacing an older list of 1,850 characters known as the {{Nihongo||\u5f53\u7528\u6f22\u5b57|[[t\u014dy\u014d kanji]]|general-use kanji}}, introduced in 1946. Originally numbering 1,945 characters, the ''j\u014dy\u014d kanji'' list was expanded to 2,136 in 2010. Some of the new characters were previously ''Jinmeiy\u014d kanji''; some are used to write prefecture names: {{Nihongo2|\u962a}}, {{Nihongo2|\u718a}}, {{Nihongo2|\u5948}}, {{Nihongo2|\u5ca1}}, {{Nihongo2|\u9e7f}}, {{Nihongo2|\u68a8}}, {{Nihongo2|\u961c}}, {{Nihongo2|\u57fc}}, {{Nihongo2|\u8328}}, {{Nihongo2|\u6803}} and {{Nihongo2|\u5a9b}}.\n\n===Jinmeiy\u014d kanji===\n{{Main|Jinmeiy\u014d kanji}}\nAs of September 25, 2017, the {{Nihongo||\u4eba\u540d\u7528\u6f22\u5b57|jinmeiy\u014d kanji|kanji for use in personal names}} consists of 863 characters. Kanji on this list are mostly used in people's names and some are traditional variants of ''j\u014dy\u014d kanji''. There were only 92 kanji in the original list published in 1952, but new additions have been made frequently. Sometimes the term ''jinmeiy\u014d kanji'' refers to all 2,999 kanji from both the ''j\u014dy\u014d'' and ''jinmeiy\u014d'' lists combined.\n\n===Hy\u014dgai kanji===\n{{Main|Hy\u014dgai kanji}}\n{{Nihongo||\u8868\u5916\u6f22\u5b57|Hy\u014dgai kanji|\"unlisted characters\"}} are any kanji not contained in the ''j\u014dy\u014d kanji'' and ''jinmeiy\u014d kanji'' lists.

They have had numerous revisions. The current standards are:\n*[[JIS X 0208]],<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050522084722/http://www.io.com/~kazushi/encoding/jis.html#kanji90#kanji90 JIS X 0208:1997].</ref> the most recent version of the main standard. It has 6,355 kanji.\n*[[JIS X 0212]],<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050522084722/http://www.io.com/~kazushi/encoding/jis.html#kanjisup#kanjisup JIS X 0212:1990].</ref> a supplementary standard containing a further 5,801 kanji. This standard is rarely used, mainly because the common [[Shift JIS]] encoding system could not use it. This standard is effectively obsolete;\n*[[JIS X 0213]],<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050522084722/http://www.io.com/~kazushi/encoding/jis.html#kanji00#kanji00 JIS X 0213:2000].</ref> a further revision which extended the JIS X 0208 set with 3,695 additional kanji, of which 2,743 (all but 952) were in JIS X 0212. The standard is in part designed to be compatible with Shift JIS encoding;\n*JIS X 0221:1995, the Japanese version of the ISO 10646/[[Unicode]] standard.\n\n====Gaiji====\n{{Nihongo||\u5916\u5b57|Gaiji|literally \"external characters\"}} are kanji that are not represented in existing Japanese [[Character encoding|encoding systems]]. These include variant forms of common kanji that need to be represented alongside the more conventional [[glyph]] in reference works, and can include non-kanji symbols as well.\n\n''Gaiji'' can be either user-defined characters or system-specific characters. Both are a problem for information interchange, as the [[code point]] used to represent an external character will not be consistent from one computer or operating system to another.\n\n''Gaiji'' were nominally prohibited in JIS X 0208-1997, and JIS X 0213-2000 used the range of code-points previously allocated to ''gaiji'', making them completely unusable. Nevertheless, they persist today with [[NTT DoCoMo]]'s \"[[i-mode]]\" service, where they are used for [[emoji]] (pictorial characters).\n\n[[Unicode]] allows for optional encoding of ''gaiji'' in [[Private Use (Unicode)|private use areas]], while [[OpenType#SING gaiji solution|Adobe's SING]] (Smart INdependent Glyphlets)<ref>{{citation | publisher = Adobe | url = https://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=2437 | title = Introducing the SING Gaiji architecture}}.</ref><ref>{{citation | publisher = Adobe | url = https://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/ | title = OpenType Technology Center}}.</ref> technology allows the creation of customized gaiji.\n\nThe [[Text Encoding Initiative]] uses a '''<g>''' element to encode any non-standard character or glyph, including gaiji.<ref>{{citation | publisher = TEI-C | url = http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/WD.html | chapter = Representation of Non-standard Characters and Glyphs | title = P5: Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange}}.</ref> (The '''g''' stands for \"gaiji\")<ref>{{citation | publisher = TEI-C | url = http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-g.html | chapter = TEI element g (character or glyph) | title = P5: Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and Interchange}}.</ref>\n\n==Total number of kanji==\nThere is no definitive count of kanji characters, just as there is none of Chinese characters generally. The ''[[Dai Kan-Wa Jiten]]'', which is considered to be comprehensive in Japan, contains about 50,000 characters. The ''[[Zhonghua Zihai]]'', published in 1994 in China, contains about 85,000 characters, but the majority of them are not in common use in any country, and many are obscure variants or archaic forms.<ref name=taipei>Kuang-Hui Chiu, Chi-Ching Hsu (2006).

From the reader's point of view, kanji are said to have one or more different \"readings\". Although more than one reading may become activated in the brain,<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/17470218.2013.773050|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236062398_The_multiple_pronunciations_of_Japanese_kanji_A_masked_priming_investigation| pmid = 23510000| title = The multiple pronunciations of Japanese kanji: A masked priming investigation| journal = The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology| volume = 66| issue = 10| pages = 2023| year = 2013| last1 = Verdonschot | first1 = R.

O. }}</ref> deciding which reading is appropriate depends on recognizing which word it represents, which can usually be determined from context, intended meaning, whether the character occurs as part of a compound word or an independent word, and sometimes location within the sentence. For example, {{lang|ja|\u4eca\u65e5}} is usually read ''ky\u014d'', meaning \"today\", but in formal writing is instead read ''konnichi'', meaning \"nowadays\"; this is understood from context. Nevertheless, some cases are ambiguous and require a ''[[furigana]]'' gloss, which are also used simply for difficult readings or to specify a non-standard reading.\n\nKanji readings are categorized as either ''on'yomi'' (literally \"sound reading\", from Chinese) or ''kun'yomi'' (literally \"meaning reading\", native Japanese), and most characters have at least two readings, at least one of each. However, some characters have only a single reading, such as {{Nihongo||\u83ca|kiku|\"chrysanthemum\", an ''on''-reading}} or {{Nihongo||\u9c2f|iwashi|\"sardine\", a ''kun''-reading}}; ''kun''-only are common for Japanese-coined kanji (''kokuji''). Some common kanji have ten or more possible readings; the most complex common example is {{Nihongo2|\u751f}}, which is read as ''sei, sh\u014d, nama, ki, o-u, i-kiru, i-kasu, i-keru, u-mu, u-mareru, ha-eru'', and ''ha-yasu'', totaling 8 basic readings (first 2 are ''on'', rest are ''kun''), or 12 if related verbs are counted as distinct; see [[Okurigana#\u751f|okurigana: \u751f]] for details.\n\nMost often, a character will be used for both sound and meaning, and it is simply a matter of choosing the correct reading based on which word it represents. In other cases, a character is used only for sound (''[[ateji]]''). In this case, pronunciation is still based on a standard reading, or used only for meaning (broadly a form of ''ateji'', narrowly ''jukujikun''). Therefore, only the full compound\u2014not the individual character\u2014has a reading. There are also [[#Special readings|special cases]] where the reading is completely different, often based on a historical or traditional reading.\n\nThe analogous phenomenon occurs to a much lesser degree in [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]], where there are [[literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters]]\u2014borrowed readings and native readings. In Chinese these borrowed readings and native readings are etymologically related, since they are between Chinese varieties (which are related), not from Chinese to Japanese (which are not related). They thus form [[Doublet (linguistics)|doublets]] and are generally similar, analogous to different on'yomi, reflecting different stages of Chinese borrowings into Japanese.\n\n===''On'yomi'' (Sino-Japanese reading) {{anchor|on'yomi|on-yomi|onyomi|on'yomi (Chinese reading)}} <!-- for redirects and direct links to older section names --> ===\nThe {{Nihongo||\u97f3\u8aad\u307f|'''on'yomi'''|{{IPA-ja|o\u0270\u0303jomi|}}, lit. \"sound(-based) reading\"}}, the [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese]] reading, is the modern descendant of the Japanese approximation of the base Chinese pronunciation of the character at the time it was introduced. It was often previously referred to as '''translation reading''', as it was recreated readings of the Chinese pronunciation but was not the Chinese pronunciation or reading itself, similar to the English pronunciation of Latin loanwords. Old Japanese scripts often stated that ''on'yomi'' readings were also created by the Japanese during their arrival and re-borrowed by the Chinese as their own. There also exist kanji created by the Japanese and given an ''on'yomi'' reading despite not being a Chinese-derived or a Chinese-originating character. Some kanji were introduced from different parts of China at different times, and so have multiple ''on'yomi'', and often multiple meanings. ''Kanji'' invented in Japan would not normally be expected to have ''on'yomi'', but there are exceptions, such as the character {{Nihongo2|\u50cd}} \"to work\", which has the ''kun'yomi'' \"''hataraku''\" and the ''on'yomi'' \"''d\u014d''\", and {{Nihongo2|\u817a}} \"gland\", which has only the ''on'yomi'' \"''sen''\"\u2014in both cases these come from the ''on'yomi'' of the phonetic component, respectively {{Nihongo2|\u52d5}} \"''d\u014d''\" and {{Nihongo2|\u6cc9}} \"''sen''\".\n\nGenerally, ''on'yomi'' are classified into four types according to their region and time of origin:\n*{{Nihongo||\u5449\u97f3|'''[[Go-on]]'''|\"Wu sound\"}} readings are from the pronunciation during the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]] of China during the 5th and 6th centuries. ''Go'' refers to the [[Wu (region)|Wu]] region (in the vicinity of modern [[Shanghai]]), which still maintains linguistic similarities with modern Sino-Japanese vocabulary. See also: [[Wu Chinese]] and [[Shanghainese language]].\n*{{Nihongo||\u6f22\u97f3|'''[[Kan-on]]'''|\"Han sound\"}} readings are from the pronunciation during the [[Tang dynasty]] of China in the 7th to 9th centuries, primarily from the standard speech of the capital, [[Chang'an]] (modern [[Xi'an]]). Here, ''Kan'' refers to [[Han Chinese|Han Chinese people]] or [[China proper]].\n*{{Nihongo||\u5510\u97f3|'''[[T\u014d-on]]'''|\"Tang sound\"}} readings are from the pronunciations of later dynasties of China, such as the [[Song dynasty|Song]] and [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]. They cover all readings adopted from the [[Heian era]] to the [[Edo period]]. This is also known as {{Nihongo||\u5510\u5b8b\u97f3|T\u014ds\u014d-on|Tang and Song sound}}.\n*{{anchor|kan'y\u014d-on|kan'y\u014don|kan'you-on}} {{Nihongo||\u6163\u7528\u97f3|'''Kan'y\u014d-on'''|\"customary sound\"}} readings, which are mistaken or changed readings of the kanji that have become accepted into the Japanese language. In some cases, they are the actual readings that accompanied the character's introduction to Japan, but do not match how the character [[linguistic prescription|\"should\"]] (is prescribed to) be read according to the rules of character construction and pronunciation.\n\n{| class=\"infobox\" align=\"right\"\n|+ Examples <small>(rare readings in parentheses)</small>\n|-\n!

The ''go-on'' readings are especially common in [[Buddhist]] terminology such as {{Nihongo||\u6975\u697d|gokuraku|paradise}}, as well as in some of the earliest loans, such as the Sino-Japanese numbers. The ''t\u014d-on'' readings occur in some later words, such as {{Nihongo||\u6905\u5b50|isu|chair}}, {{Nihongo||\u5e03\u56e3|[[futon]]|mattress}}, and {{Nihongo||\u884c\u706f|andon|a kind of paper lantern}}. The go-on, kan-on, and t\u014d-on readings are generally [[cognate]] (with rare exceptions of homographs; see below), having a common origin in [[Old Chinese]], and hence form [[doublet (linguistics)|linguistic doublets]] or triplets, but they can differ significantly from each other and from modern Chinese pronunciation.\n\nIn Chinese, most characters are associated with a single Chinese sound, though there are distinct [[literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters|literary and colloquial readings]]. However, some homographs ({{lang|zh|\u591a\u97f3\u5b57}} {{zh|p=du\u014dy\u012bnz\u00ec}}) such as {{lang|zh|\u884c}} (''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|h\u00e1ng}}'' or ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|x\u00edng}}'') (Japanese: ''an, g\u014d, gy\u014d'')<!--in go'on. in kan'on, both are ''k\u014d''--> have more than one reading in Chinese representing different meanings, which is reflected in the carryover to Japanese as well. Additionally, many Chinese syllables, especially those with an [[entering tone]], did not fit the largely consonant-vowel (CV) [[phonotactics]] of classical Japanese. Thus most ''on'yomi'' are composed of two [[Mora (linguistics)|morae]] (beats), the second of which is either a lengthening of the vowel in the first mora (to ''ei'', ''\u014d'', or ''\u016b''), the vowel ''i''<!--eg. ''ai'', ''sui''-->, or one of the syllables ''ku'', ''ki'', ''tsu'', ''chi'', ''fu'' (historically, later merged into ''\u014d''), or moraic ''n'', chosen for their approximation to the final consonants of Middle Chinese. It may be that [[Y\u014don|palatalized consonants before vowels other than ''i'']] developed in Japanese as a result of Chinese borrowings, as they are virtually unknown in words of native Japanese origin, but are common in Chinese.\n\n''On'yomi'' primarily occur in {{nihongo|multi-kanji compound words|\u719f\u8a9e|jukugo}} words, many of which are the result of the adoption, along with the kanji themselves, of Chinese words for concepts that either did not exist in Japanese or could not be articulated as elegantly using native words. This borrowing process is often compared to the [[List of English words with dual French and Anglo-Saxon variations|English borrowings from Latin, Greek, and Norman French]], since Chinese-borrowed terms are often more specialized, or considered to sound more erudite or formal, than their native counterparts (occupying a higher [[linguistic register]]).  The major exception to this rule is [[Japanese family name|family name]]s, in which the native ''kun'yomi'' are usually used (though ''on'yomi'' are found in many personal names, especially men's names).\n\n=== ''Kun'yomi'' (native reading)  {{anchor|kun'yomi|kun-yomi|kunyomi|Japanese reading|native reading}} ===\nThe {{Nihongo||\u8a13\u8aad\u307f|'''kun'yomi'''|{{IPA-ja|k\u026f\u0270\u0303jomi|}}, {{abbr|lit.|literally}} \"meaning reading\"}}, the native reading, is a reading based on the pronunciation of a native [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word, or ''[[yamato kotoba]]'', that closely approximated the meaning of the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] character when it was introduced. As with ''on'yomi'', there can be multiple ''kun'yomi'' for the same kanji, and some kanji have no ''kun'yomi'' at all.\n\nFor instance, the character for [[east]], {{Nihongo2|[[wikt:\u6771|\u6771]]}}, has the ''on'yomi'' ''t\u014d'', from [[Middle Chinese]] ''{{IPA|tung}}''. However, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] already had two words for \"east\": ''higashi'' and ''azuma''. Thus the kanji {{lang|ja|\u6771}} had the latter readings added as ''kun'yomi''. In contrast, the kanji {{lang|ja|[[Cun (length)|\u5bf8]]}}, denoting a Chinese unit of measurement (about 30&nbsp;mm or 1.2&nbsp;inch), has no native [[Japanese language|Japanese]] equivalent; it only has an ''on'yomi'', ''[[Cun (length)|sun]]'', with no native ''kun'yomi''. Most ''[[kokuji]]'', Japanese-created Chinese characters, only have ''kun'yomi'', although some have back-formed a pseudo-''on'yomi'' by analogy with similar characters, such as {{Nihongo2|\u50cd}} ''d\u014d'', from {{Nihongo2|\u52d5}} ''d\u014d'', and there are even some, such as {{Nihongo2|\u817a}} ''sen'' \"gland\", that have only an ''on'yomi''.\n\n''Kun'yomi'' are characterized by the strict (C)V syllable structure of ''yamato kotoba''. Most noun or adjective ''kun'yomi'' are two to three syllables long, while verb ''kun'yomi'' are usually between one and three syllables in length, not counting trailing [[hiragana]] called ''[[okurigana]]''. ''Okurigana'' are not considered to be part of the internal reading of the character, although they are part of the reading of the word. A beginner in the language will rarely come across characters with long readings, but readings of three or even four syllables are not uncommon. This contrasts with ''on'yomi'', which are monosyllabic, and is unusual in the [[Chinese family of scripts]], which generally use one character per syllable\u2014not only in Chinese, but also in Korean, Vietnamese, and Zhuang; [[polysyllabic Chinese character]]s are rare and considered non-standard.\n\n{{Nihongo2|\u627f\u308b}} ''uketamawaru'',  {{Nihongo2|\u5fd7}} ''kokorozashi'', and {{Nihongo2|\u8a54}} ''mikotonori'' have five syllables represented by a single kanji, the longest readings in the [[J\u014dy\u014d kanji|''j\u014dy\u014d'' character set]]. These unusually long readings are due to a single character representing a compound word:\n\n* {{lang|ja|\u627f\u308b}} is a single character for a compound verb, one component of which has a long reading.\n** It has an alternative spelling as {{lang|ja|\u53d7\u3051\u8cdc\u308b}} ''u(ke)-tamawa(ru)'', hence (1+1)+3=5.\n** Compare common {{lang|ja|\u53d7\u3051\u4ed8\u3051\u308b}} ''u(ke)-tsu(keru)''.\n* {{lang|ja|\u5fd7}} is a nominalization of the verb {{lang|ja|\u5fd7\u3059}} which has a long reading ''kokoroza(su)''.\n** This is due to its being derived from a noun-verb compound, {{lang|ja|\u5fc3\u6307\u3059}} ''kokoro-za(su)''.\n** The nominalization removes the okurigana, hence increasing the reading by one mora, yielding 4+1=5.\n** Compare common {{lang|ja|\u8a71}} ''hanashi'' 2+1=3, from {{lang|ja|\u8a71\u3059}} ''hana(su)''.\n* {{lang|ja|\u8a54}} is a triple compound.\n** It has an alternative spelling {{lang|ja|\u5fa1\u8a00\u5ba3}} ''mi-koto-nori'', hence 1+2+2=5.\n\nLonger readings exist for non-J\u014dy\u014d characters and non-kanji symbols, where a long [[gairaigo]] word may be the reading (this is classed as ''kun'yomi''\u2014see [[#Single character gairaigo|single character gairaigo]], below)\u2014the character {{Nihongo2|\u7cce}} has the seven kana reading {{lang|ja-Kana|\u30bb\u30f3\u30c1\u30e1\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb}} ''senchim\u0113toru'' \"centimeter\", though it is generally written as \"cm\" (with two half-width characters, so occupying one space); another common example is '%' (the percent sign), which has the five kana reading {{lang|ja-Kana|\u30d1\u30fc\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8}} ''p\u0101sento''. Further, some J\u014dy\u014d characters have long non-J\u014dy\u014d readings (students learn the character, but not the reading), such as ''omonpakaru'' for {{lang|ja|\u616e\u308b}}.\n\nIn a number of cases, multiple kanji were assigned to cover a single [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word. Typically when this occurs, the different kanji refer to specific shades of meaning. For instance, the word {{lang|ja-Kana|\u306a\u304a\u3059}}, ''naosu'', when written {{lang|ja|\u6cbb\u3059}}, means \"to heal an illness or sickness\". When written {{lang|ja|\u76f4\u3059}} it means \"to fix or correct something\". Sometimes the distinction is very clear, although not always. Differences of opinion among reference works is not uncommon; one dictionary may say the kanji are equivalent, while another dictionary may draw distinctions of use. As a result, native speakers of the language may have trouble knowing which kanji to use and resort to personal preference or by writing the word in [[hiragana]]. This latter strategy is frequently employed with more complex cases such as \u3082\u3068 ''moto'', which has at least five different kanji: {{lang|ja|\u5143, \u57fa, \u672c, \u4e0b}}, and {{lang|ja|\u7d20}}, the first three of which have only very subtle differences. Another notable example is ''sakazuki'' \"sake cup\", which may be spelt as at least five different kanji: {{lang|ja|\u676f, \u76c3, \u5df5/\u536e}}, and {{lang|ja|\u574f}}; of these, the first two are common\u2014formally {{lang|ja|\u676f}} is a small cup and {{lang|ja|\u76c3}} a large cup.\n\nLocal dialectical readings of kanji are also classified under ''kun'yomi'', most notably readings for words in [[Ryukyuan languages]]. Further, in rare cases gairaigo (borrowed words) have a single character associated with them, in which case this reading is formally classified as a ''kun'yomi'', because the character is being used for meaning, not sound. This is discussed under [[#Single character gairaigo|single character gairaigo]], below.\n\n===Mixed readings {{anchor|j\u016bbako|juubako|jubako|yut\u014d|yutou|yuto}} ===\n[[File:J\u016bbako.jpg|thumb|A {{Nihongo||\u91cd\u7bb1|j\u016bbako}}, which has a mixed on-kun reading]]\n[[File:Pail,yutou,soba-yu,katori-city,japan.JPG|thumb|A {{Nihongo||\u6e6f\u6876|yut\u014d}}, which has a mixed kun-on reading]]\nThere are many kanji compounds that use a mixture of ''on'yomi'' and ''kun'yomi'', known as {{Nihongo||\u91cd\u7bb1\u8aad\u307f|j\u016bbako yomi|multi-layered food box}} or {{Nihongo||\u6e6f\u6876|yut\u014d|hot liquid pail}} words (depending on the order), which are themselves examples of this kind of compound (they are [[autological word]]s): the first character of ''j\u016bbako'' is read using ''on'yomi'', the second ''kun'yomi'' (''on-kun''). \nIt is the other way around with ''yut\u014d'' (''kun-on'').\n\nFormally, these are referred to as {{Nihongo||\u91cd\u7bb1\u8aad\u307f|j\u016bbako-yomi|''j\u016bbako'' reading}} and {{Nihongo||\u6e6f\u6876\u8aad\u307f|yut\u014d-yomi|''yut\u014d'' reading}}. Note that in both these words, the ''on'yomi'' has a long vowel; long vowels in Japanese generally are derived from sound changes common to loans from Chinese, hence distinctive of ''on'yomi''. These are the Japanese form of [[hybrid word]]s. Other examples include {{nihongo||\u5834\u6240|basho|\"place\", ''kun-on''}}, {{nihongo||\u91d1\u8272|kin'iro|\"golden\", ''on-kun''}} and {{nihongo||\u5408\u6c17\u9053|aikid\u014d|the martial art [[Aikido]]\", ''kun-on-on''}}.\n\n''Ateji'' often use mixed readings. For instance the city of [[Sapporo]], whose name derives from the [[Ainu language]] and has no meaning in Japanese, is written with the ''on-kun'' compound {{lang|ja|\u672d\u5e4c}} (which includes ''[[sokuon]]'' as if it were a purely ''on'' compound).\n\n===Special readings===\n{{nihongo||{{linktext|\u7fa9\u8a13}}|{{visible anchor|Gikun}}}} and {{nihongo||{{linktext|\u719f\u5b57\u8a13}}|{{visible anchor|jukujikun}}}} are readings of kanji combinations that have no direct correspondence to the characters' individual ''on'yomi'' or ''kun'yomi''. From the point of view of the character, rather than the word, this is known as a {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u96e3\u8a13}}|nankun|difficult reading}}, and these are listed in kanji dictionaries under the entry for the character.\n\n''Gikun'' are when kanji that are barely or even at all related to their readings in terms of meaning are used, such as using {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u5bd2}}}} meaning \"cold\" with reading ''fuyu'' (\"winter\"), rather than the standard character {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u51ac}}}}. These usages are typically non-standard and employed in specific contexts by individual writers, with few exceptions, such as the spelling of ''[[Asuka period|Asuka]]'', \u98db\u9ce5. Aided with [[furigana]], ''gikun'' could be used to convey complex literary or poetic effect (especially if the readings contradict the kanji), or clarification if the referent may not be obvious.\n\n''Jukujikun'' are when the standard kanji for a word are related to the meaning, but not the sound. The word is pronounced as a whole, not corresponding to sounds of individual kanji. For example, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u4eca\u671d}}}} (\"this morning\") is jukujikun, and read neither as *''ima'asa'', the ''kun'yomi'' of the characters, infrequently as ''konch\u014d'', the ''on'yomi'' of the characters, and not as any combination thereof. Instead it is read as ''kesa'', a native bisyllabic Japanese word that may be seen as a single [[morpheme]], or as a fusion of ''ky\u014d'' (previously ''kefu''), \"today\", and ''asa'', \"morning\". Likewise, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u4eca\u65e5}}}} (\"today\") is also jukujikun, usually read with the native reading ''ky\u014d''; its on'yomi, ''konnichi'', does occur in certain words and expressions, especially in the broader sense \"nowadays\" or \"current\", such as {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u4eca\u65e5\u7684}}}} (\"present-day\"), although in the phrase ''konnichi wa'' (\"good day\"), ''konnichi'' is typically spelled wholly with hiragana rather than with the kanji {{Nihongo2|\u4eca\u65e5}}.\n\nJukujikun are primarily used for some native Japanese words, such as [[Yamato (disambiguation)|Yamato]]<!-- intentional link to DAB page--> ({{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u5927\u548c}}}} or {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u502d}}}}, the name of a Japanese province as well as ancient name for Japan), and for some old borrowings, such as {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u67f3\u8449\u9b5a}}|[[shishamo]]|willow leaf fish}} from Ainu, {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u7159\u8349}}|tabako|smoke grass}} from Portuguese, or ''b\u012bru'' ({{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u9ea6\u9152}}}}, wheat alcohol) from Dutch, especially if the word was borrowed before the [[Meiji period|Meiji Period]]. Words whose kanji are jukujikun are often usually written as hiragana (if native), or katakana (if borrowed); some old borrowed words are also written as hiragana, especially Portuguese loanwords such as ''karuta'' ({{linktext|\u304b\u308b\u305f}}) from Portuguese \"carta\" (Eng: card), ''tempura'' ({{linktext|\u3066\u3093\u3077\u3089}}) from Portuguese \"tempora\", and ''pan'' ({{linktext|\u3071\u3093}}) from Spanish \"pan\" (Eng: bread), as well as ''tabako'' ({{linktext|\u305f\u3070\u3053}}).\n\nSometimes, jukujikun can even have more kanji than there are syllables, examples being ''kera'' ({{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u5544\u6728\u9ce5}}}}, woodpecker), ''gumi'' ({{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u80e1\u983d\u5b50}}}}, silver berry/oleaster),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/29056/how-many-possible-phonological-forms-could-be-represented-by-a-randomly-chosen-s|title=How many possible phonological forms could be represented by a randomly chosen single character?|website=japanese.stackexchange.com|access-date=2017-07-15}}</ref> and ''Hozumi'' ({{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u516b\u6708\u6714\u65e5}}}}, a surname).<ref name=\"How do Japanese names work\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/names-for-people.html|title=How do Japanese names work?|website=www.sljfaq.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-14}}</ref> This phenomenon is observed in animal names that are shortened and used as suffixes for zoological compound names, for example when {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u9ec4\u91d1\u866b}}}}, normally read as ''koganemushi'', is shortened to ''kogane'' in {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u9ed2\u9ec4\u91d1\u866b}}}} ''kurokogane'', although zoological names are commonly spelled with katakana rather than with kanji anyway. Outside zoology, this type of shortening only occurs on a handful of words, for example {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u5927\u5143\u5e25}}}} ''daigen(sui)'', or the historical male name suffix {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u53f3\u885b\u9580}}}} ''-emon'' which was shortened from the word ''uemon''.\n\nJukujikun are quite varied. Often the kanji compound for jukujikun is idiosyncratic and created for the word, and where the corresponding Chinese word does not exist; in other cases a kanji compound for an existing Chinese word is reused, where the Chinese word and ''on'yomi'' may or may not be used in Japanese; for example, {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u99b4\u9e7f}}||reindeer}} is jukujikun for ''tonakai'', from Ainu, but the ''on'yomi'' reading of ''junroku'' is also used. In some cases Japanese coinages have subsequently been borrowed back into  Chinese, such as {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u9b9f\u9c47}}|ank\u014d|monkfish}}.\n\nThe underlying word for jukujikun is a native Japanese word or foreign borrowing, which either does not have an existing kanji spelling (either ''kun'yomi'' or ''ateji'') or for which a new kanji spelling is produced. Most often the word is a noun, which may be a simple noun (not a compound or derived from a verb), or may be a verb form or a fusional pronunciation; for example {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u76f8\u64b2}}|sum\u014d|[[sumo]]}} is originally from the verb {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u4e89\u3046}}|suma-u|to vie}}, while {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u4eca\u65e5}}|ky\u014d|today}} is fusional. In rare cases jukujikun is also applied to inflectional words (verbs and adjectives), in which case there is frequently a corresponding Chinese word.\n\nExamples of jukujikun for inflectional words follow. The most common example of a jukujikun adjective is {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u53ef\u611b\u3044}}|kawai-i|cute}}, originally ''kawayu-i;'' the word {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u53ef\u611b}}}} is used in Chinese, but the corresponding ''on'yomi'' is not used in Japanese. By contrast, \"appropriate\" can be either {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u76f8\u5fdc\u3057\u3044}}|fusawa-shii|in jukujikun}} or {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u76f8\u5fdc}}|s\u014d\u014d|in ''on'yomi''}} are both used; the ''-shii'' ending is because these were formerly a different class of adjectives. A common example of a verb with jukujikun is {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u6d41\u884c\u308b}}|haya-ru|to spread, to be in vogue}}, corresponding to ''on'yomi'' {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u6d41\u884c}}|ry\u016bk\u014d}}. A sample jukujikun deverbal (noun derived from a verb form) is {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u5f37\u8acb}}|yusuri|extortion}}, from {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u5f37\u8acb\u308b}}|yusu-ru|to extort}}, spelling from {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u5f37\u8acb}}|ky\u014dsei|extortion}}. See [[:ja:\u7fa9\u8a13#\u7fa9\u8a13|\u7fa9\u8a13]] and [[:ja:\u719f\u5b57\u8a13|\u719f\u5b57\u8a13]] for many more examples. Note that there are also compound verbs and, less commonly, compound adjectives, and while these may have multiple kanji without intervening characters, they are read using usual ''kun'yomi;'' examples include {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u9762\u767d\u3044}}|omo-shiro-i|interesting|face-whitening}} and {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u72e1\u8ce2\u3044}}|zuru-gashiko-i|sly}}.\n\nTypographically, the [[furigana]] for jukujikun are often written so they are centered across the entire word, or for inflectional words over the entire root\u2014corresponding to the reading being related to the entire word\u2014rather than each part of the word being centered over its corresponding character, as is often done for the usual phono-semantic readings.\n\nBroadly speaking, jukujikun can be considered a form of ''[[ateji]]'', though in narrow usage \"ateji\" refers specifically to using characters for sound and not meaning (sound-spelling), rather than meaning and not sound (meaning-spelling), as in jukujikun.\n\nMany jukujikun (established meaning-spellings) began life as gikun (improvised meaning-spellings). Occasionally a single word will have many such kanji spellings; an extreme example is {{nihongo|||hototogisu|[[Lesser Cuckoo|lesser cuckoo]]}}, which may be spelt in a great many ways, including {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u675c\u9d51}}}}, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u6642\u9ce5}}}}, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u5b50\u898f}}}}, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u4e0d\u5982\u5e30}}}}, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u970d\u516c\u9ce5}}}}, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u8700\u9b42}}}},  {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u6c93\u624b\u9ce5}}}}, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u675c\u5b87}}}},{{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u7530\u9d51}}}}, {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u6c93\u76f4\u9ce5}}}}, and {{Nihongo2|{{linktext|\u90ed\u516c}}}}\u2014many of these variant spellings are particular to [[haiku]] poems.\n\n===Single character gairaigo===\nIn some rare cases, an individual kanji has a reading that is borrowed from a modern foreign language ([[gairaigo]]), though most often these words are written in katakana. Notable examples include {{nihongo||\u9801\u3001\u30da\u30fc\u30b8|p\u0113ji|page}}, {{nihongo||\u91e6\uff0f\u9215\u3001\u30dc\u30bf\u30f3|botan|button}}, {{nihongo||\u96f6\u3001\u30bc\u30ed|zero|zero}}, and {{nihongo||\u7c73\u3001\u30e1\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb|m\u0113toru|meter}}. See [[wikt:Appendix:Single character gairaigo|list of single character gairaigo]] for more. These are classed as ''kun'yomi'' of a single character, because the character is being used for meaning only (without the Chinese pronunciation), rather than as [[ateji]], which is the classification used when a gairaigo term is written as a compound (2 or more characters). However, unlike the vast majority of other ''kun'yomi'', these readings are not native Japanese, but rather borrowed, so the \"kun'yomi\" label can be misleading. The readings are also written in katakana, unlike the usual hiragana for native ''kun'yomi''. Note that most of these characters are for units, particularly [[International System of Units#Chinese and Japanese|SI units]], in many cases using new characters ([[kokuji]]) coined during the [[Meiji period]], such as {{nihongo||\u7c81\u3001\u30ad\u30ed\u30e1\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb|kirom\u0113toru|kilometer, {{Nihongo2|\u7c73}} \"meter\" + {{Nihongo2|\u5343}} \"thousand\"}}.\n\n===Other readings===\nSome kanji also have lesser-known readings called ''[[nanori]]'' ({{Nihongo2|\u540d\u4e57\u308a}}), which are mostly used for names (often [[given name]]s) and in general, are closely related to the ''kun'yomi''. Place names sometimes also use ''nanori'' or, occasionally, unique readings not found elsewhere.\n\nFor example, there is the surname {{lang|ja|\u5c0f\u9ce5\u904a}} (literally, \"little birds at play\") that implies there are no predators, such as hawks, present. Pronounced, \"''kotori asobu''\". The name then can also mean {{lang|ja|\u9df9\u304c\u3044\u306a\u3044}} (''taka ga inai'', literally, \"no hawks around\") and it can be shortened to be pronounced as ''Takanashi''.<ref>[http://myoji-yurai.net/searchResult.htm?myojiKanji=\u5c0f\u9ce5\u904a {{Nihongo2|\u3010\u540d\u5b57\u3011\u5c0f\u9ce5\u904a}}]</ref>\n\n===When to use which reading===\nAlthough there are general rules for when to use ''on'yomi'' and when to use ''kun'yomi'', the language is littered with exceptions, and it is not always possible for even a native speaker to know how to read a character without prior knowledge (this is especially true for names, both of people and places); further, a given character may have multiple ''kun'yomi'' or ''on'yomi''. When reading Japanese, one primarily recognizes ''words'' (multiple characters and okurigana) and their readings, rather than individual characters, and only guess readings of characters when trying to \"sound out\" an unrecognized word.\n\nHomographs exist, however, which can sometimes be deduced from context, and sometimes cannot, requiring a glossary.  For example, {{Nihongo2|\u4eca\u65e5}} may be read either as ''ky\u014d'' \"today (informal)\" (special fused reading for native word) or as ''konnichi'' \"these days (formal)\" (''on'yomi''); in formal writing this will generally be read as ''konnichi''. In some cases multiple readings are common, as in {{Nihongo2|\u8c5a\u6c41}} \"pork soup\", which is commonly pronounced both as ''ton-jiru'' (mixed ''on-kun'') and ''buta-jiru'' (''kun-kun''), with ''ton'' somewhat more common nationally. Inconsistencies abound\u2014for example {{Nihongo2|\u725b\u8089}} ''gy\u016b-niku'' \"beef\" and {{Nihongo2|\u7f8a\u8089}} ''y\u014d-niku'' \"mutton\" have ''on-on'' readings, but {{Nihongo2|\u8c5a\u8089}} ''buta-niku'' \"pork\" and {{Nihongo2|\u9d8f\u8089}} ''tori-niku'' \"poultry\" have ''kun-on'' readings.\n\nThe main guideline is that a single kanji followed by ''okurigana'' (hiragana characters that are part of the word)\u2014as used in native verbs and adjectives\u2014''always'' indicates ''kun'yomi'', while kanji compounds (kango) usually use ''on'yomi'', which is usually ''kan-on;'' however, other ''on'yomi'' are also common, and ''kun'yomi'' are also commonly used in kango. For a kanji in isolation without okurigana, it is typically read using their ''kun'yomi'', though there are numerous exceptions. For example, {{Nihongo2|\u9244}} \"iron\" is usually read with the ''on'yomi'' ''tetsu'' rather than the ''kun'yomi'' ''kurogane''. Chinese ''on'yomi'' which are not the common ''kan-on'' reading are a frequent cause of difficulty or mistakes when encountering unfamiliar words or for inexperienced readers, though skilled natives will recognize the word; a good example is {{Nihongo||\u89e3\u6bd2|ge-doku|detoxification, anti-poison}} (''go-on''), where {{Nihongo||\u89e3}} is usually instead read as ''kai''.\n\n[[Okurigana]] are used with ''kun'yomi'' to mark the inflected ending of a native verb or adjective, or by convention. Note that Japanese verbs and adjectives are [[closed class]], and do not generally admit new words (borrowed Chinese vocabulary, which are nouns, can form verbs by adding {{Nihongo||\u301c\u3059\u308b|-suru|to do}} at the end, and adjectives via {{Nihongo2|\u301c\u306e}} ''-no'' or {{Nihongo2|\u301c\u306a}} ''-na'', but cannot become native Japanese vocabulary, which inflect). For example: {{Nihongo2|\u8d64\u3044}} ''aka-i'' \"red\", {{Nihongo2|\u65b0\u3057\u3044}} ''atara-shii'' \"new\", {{Nihongo2|\u898b\u308b}} ''mi-ru'' \"(to) see\". Okurigana can be used to indicate which ''kun'yomi'' to use, as in {{Nihongo2|\u98df\u3079\u308b}} ''ta-beru'' versus {{Nihongo2|\u98df\u3046}} ''ku-u'' (casual), both meaning \"(to) eat\", but this is not always sufficient, as in {{Nihongo2|\u958b\u304f}}, which may be read as ''a-ku'' or ''hira-ku'', both meaning \"(to) open\". {{Nihongo2|\u751f}} is a particularly complicated example, with multiple ''kun'' and ''on'yomi''\u2014see [[Okurigana#\u751f|okurigana: \u751f]] for details. Okurigana is also used for some nouns and adverbs, as in {{Nihongo2|\u60c5\u3051}} ''nasake'' \"sympathy\",  {{Nihongo2|\u5fc5\u305a}} ''kanarazu'' \"invariably\", but not for {{Nihongo2|\u91d1}} ''kane'' \"money\", for instance. [[Okurigana]] is an important aspect of kanji usage in Japanese; see that article for more information on ''kun'yomi'' orthography\n\n{{anchor|jukugo|multi-kanji compound words}}\nKanji occurring in {{nihongo|compounds (multi-kanji words)|\u719f\u8a9e|jukugo}} are generally read using ''on'yomi'', especially for four-character compounds (''[[yojijukugo]]''). Though again, exceptions abound, for example, {{Nihongo2|\u60c5\u5831}} ''j\u014dh\u014d'' \"information\", {{Nihongo2|\u5b66\u6821}} ''gakk\u014d'' \"school\", and   {{Nihongo2|\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda}} ''shinkansen'' \"bullet train\" all follow this pattern. This isolated kanji versus compound distinction gives words for similar concepts completely different pronunciations. {{Nihongo2|\u5317}} \"north\" and {{Nihongo2|\u6771}} \"east\" use the ''kun'yomi'' ''kita'' and ''higashi'', being stand-alone characters, but {{Nihongo2|\u5317\u6771}} \"northeast\", as a compound, uses the ''on'yomi'' ''hokut\u014d''. This is further complicated by the fact that many kanji have more than one ''on'yomi'': {{Nihongo2|\u751f}} is read as ''sei'' in {{Nihongo2|\u5148\u751f}} ''sensei'' \"teacher\" but as ''sh\u014d'' in {{Nihongo2|\u4e00\u751f}} ''issh\u014d'' \"one's whole life\". Meaning can also be an important indicator of reading; {{Nihongo2|\u6613}} is read ''i'' when it means \"simple\", but as ''eki'' when it means \"divination\", both being ''on'yomi'' for this character.\n\nThese rules of thumb have many exceptions. ''Kun'yomi'' compound words are not as numerous as those with ''on'yomi'', but neither are they rare. Examples include {{Nihongo2|\u624b\u7d19}} ''tegami'' \"letter\", {{Nihongo2|\u65e5\u5098}} ''higasa'' \"parasol\", and the famous {{Nihongo2|\u795e\u98a8}} ''[[kamikaze]]'' \"divine wind\". Such compounds may also have okurigana, such as {{Nihongo2|\u7a7a\u63da\u3052}} (also written {{Nihongo2|\u5510\u63da\u3052}}) ''karaage'' \"Chinese-style fried chicken\" and {{Nihongo2|\u6298\u308a\u7d19}} ''[[origami]]'', although many of these can also be written with the okurigana omitted (for example, {{Nihongo2|\u7a7a\u63da}} or {{Nihongo2|\u6298\u7d19}}).\n\nSimilarly, some ''on'yomi'' characters can also be used as words in isolation: {{Nihongo2|\u611b}} ''ai'' \"love\", {{Nihongo2|\u7985}} ''[[Zen]]'', {{Nihongo2|\u70b9}} ''ten'' \"mark, dot\". Most of these cases involve kanji that have no ''kun'yomi'', so there can be no confusion, although exceptions do occur. Alone {{Nihongo2|\u91d1}} may be read as ''kin'' \"gold\" or as ''kane'' \"money, metal\"; only context can determine the writer's intended reading and meaning.\n\nMultiple readings have given rise to a number of [[homograph]]s, in some cases having different meanings depending on how they are read. One example is {{Nihongo2|\u4e0a\u624b}}, which can be read in three different ways: ''j\u014dzu'' (skilled), ''uwate'' (upper part), or ''kamite'' ([[Blocking (stage)#Stage directions|stage left/house right]]). In addition, {{Nihongo2|\u4e0a\u624b\u3044}} has the reading ''umai'' (skilled). More subtly, {{Nihongo2|\u660e\u65e5}} has three different readings, all meaning \"tomorrow\": ''ashita'' (casual), ''asu'' (polite), and ''my\u014dnichi'' (formal). [[Furigana]] (reading glosses) is often used to clarify any potential ambiguities.\n\nConversely, in some cases homophonous terms may be distinguished in writing by different characters, but not so distinguished in speech, and hence potentially confusing. In some cases when it is important to distinguish these in speech, the reading of a relevant character may be changed. For example, {{Nihongo2|\u79c1\u7acb}} (privately established, esp. school) and {{Nihongo2|\u5e02\u7acb}} (city established) are both normally pronounced ''shi-ritsu;'' in speech these may be distinguished by the alternative pronunciations ''watakushi-ritsu'' and ''ichi-ritsu''. More informally, in legal jargon {{Nihongo2|\u524d\u6587}} \"preamble\" and {{Nihongo2|\u5168\u6587}} \"full text\" are both pronounced ''zen-bun'', so {{Nihongo2|\u524d\u6587}} may be pronounced ''mae-bun'' for clarity, as in \"Have you memorized the preamble [not 'whole text'] of the constitution?\". As in these examples, this is primarily using a ''kun'yomi'' for one character in a normally ''on'yomi'' term.\n\nAs stated above, [[#Mixed readings|''j\u016bbako'' and ''yut\u014d'' readings]] are also not uncommon. Indeed, all four combinations of reading are possible: ''on-on'', ''kun-kun'', ''kun-on'' and ''on-kun''.\n\nSeveral famous place names, including [[names of Japan|those of Japan]] itself ({{Nihongo2|\u65e5\u672c}} ''Nihon'' or sometimes ''Nippon''), those of some cities such as [[Tokyo]] ({{Nihongo2|\u6771\u4eac}} ''T\u014dky\u014d'') and [[Kyoto]] ({{Nihongo2|\u4eac\u90fd}} ''Ky\u014dto''), and those of the main islands [[Honshu]] ({{Nihongo2|\u672c\u5dde}} ''Honsh\u016b''), [[Kyushu]] ({{Nihongo2|\u4e5d\u5dde}} ''Ky\u016bsh\u016b''), [[Shikoku]] ({{Nihongo2|\u56db\u56fd}} ''Shikoku''), and [[Hokkaido]] ({{Nihongo2|\u5317\u6d77\u9053}} ''Hokkaid\u014d'') are read with ''on'yomi''; however, the majority of Japanese place names are read with ''kun'yomi'': {{Nihongo2|\u5927\u962a}} ''\u014csaka'', {{Nihongo2|\u9752\u68ee}} ''[[Aomori Prefecture|Aomori]]'', {{Nihongo2|\u7bb1\u6839}} ''[[Hakone]]''. Names often use characters and readings that are not in common use outside of names. When characters are used as abbreviations of place names, their reading may not match that in the original. The [[Osaka]] ({{Nihongo2|\u5927\u962a}}) and [[Kobe]] ({{Nihongo2|\u795e\u6238}}) baseball team, the [[Hanshin Tigers|Hanshin]] ({{Nihongo2|\u962a\u795e}}) Tigers, take their name from the ''on'yomi'' of the second kanji of ''\u014csaka'' and the first of ''K\u014dbe''. The name of the [[Keisei Narita Airport Line|Keisei]] ({{Nihongo2|\u4eac\u6210}}) railway line\u2014linking Tokyo ({{Nihongo2|\u6771\u4eac}}) and [[Narita, Chiba|Narita]] ({{Nihongo2|\u6210\u7530}})\u2014is formed similarly, although the reading of {{Nihongo2|\u4eac}} from {{Nihongo2|\u6771\u4eac}} is ''kei'', despite ''ky\u014d'' already being an ''on'yomi'' in the word ''T\u014dky\u014d''.\n\n[[Japanese family name]]s are also usually read with ''kun'yomi'': {{Nihongo2|\u5c71\u7530}} ''Yamada'', {{Nihongo2|\u7530\u4e2d}} ''Tanaka'', {{Nihongo2|\u9234\u6728}} ''Suzuki''. Japanese [[given name]]s often have very irregular readings. Although they are not typically considered ''j\u016bbako'' or ''yut\u014d'', they often contain mixtures of ''kun'yomi'', ''on'yomi'' and ''nanori'', such as {{Nihongo2|\u5927\u52a9}} ''Daisuke'' [''on-kun''], {{Nihongo2|\u590f\u7f8e}} ''Natsumi'' [''kun-on'']. Being chosen at the discretion of the parents, the readings of given names do not follow any set rules, and it is impossible to know with certainty how to read a person's name without independent verification. Parents can be quite creative, and rumours abound of children called {{Nihongo2|\u5730\u7403}} ''\u0100su'' (\"Earth\") and {{Nihongo2|\u5929\u4f7f}} ''Enjeru'' (\"Angel\"); neither are common names, and have normal readings ''chiky\u016b'' and ''tenshi'' respectively. Some common Japanese names can be written in multiple ways, e.g. Akira can be written as {{Nihongo2|\u4eae}}, {{Nihongo2|\u5f70}}, {{Nihongo2|\u660e}}, {{Nihongo2|\u9855}}, {{Nihongo2|\u7ae0}}, {{Nihongo2|\u8074}}, {{Nihongo2|\u5149}}, {{Nihongo2|\u6676}}, {{Nihongo2|\u6644}}, {{Nihongo2|\u5f6c}}, {{Nihongo2|\u6636}}, {{Nihongo2|\u4e86}}, {{Nihongo2|\u79cb\u826f}}, {{Nihongo2|\u660e\u697d}}, {{Nihongo2|\u65e5\u65e5\u65e5}}, {{Nihongo2|\u4e9c\u7d00\u826f}}, {{Nihongo2|\u5b89\u559c\u826f}} and many other characters and kanji combinations not listed,<ref>{{Cite web|title = ateji Archives|url = http://www.tofugu.com/tag/ateji/|website = Tofugu|access-date = 2016-02-18|language = en-US|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151225050755/http://www.tofugu.com/tag/ateji|archive-date = December 25, 2015|url-status = dead}}</ref> Satoshi can be written as {{Nihongo2|\u8061}}, {{Nihongo2|\u54f2}}, {{Nihongo2|\u54f2\u53f2}}, {{Nihongo2|\u609f}}, {{Nihongo2|\u4f50\u767b\u53f2}}, {{Nihongo2|\u6681}}, {{Nihongo2|\u8a13}}, {{Nihongo2|\u54f2\u58eb}}, {{Nihongo2|\u54f2\u53f8}}, {{Nihongo2|\u654f}}, {{Nihongo2|\u8aed}}, {{Nihongo2|\u667a}}, {{Nihongo2|\u4f50\u767b\u53f8}}, {{Nihongo2|\u7e3d}}, {{Nihongo2|\u91cc\u53f2}}, {{Nihongo2|\u4e09\u5341\u56db}}, {{Nihongo2|\u4e86}}, {{Nihongo2|\u667a\u8a5e}}, etc.,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jisho.org/search/Satoshi|title=Satoshi |website=jisho.org|access-date=2016-03-05}}</ref> and Haruka can be written as {{Nihongo2|\u9065}}, {{Nihongo2|\u6625\u9999}}, {{Nihongo2|\u6674\u9999}}, {{Nihongo2|\u9065\u9999}}, {{Nihongo2|\u6625\u679c}}, {{Nihongo2|\u6674\u590f}}, {{Nihongo2|\u6625\u8cc0}}, {{Nihongo2|\u6625\u4f73}}, and several other possibilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jisho.org/search/Haruka|title=Haruka |website=jisho.org|access-date=2016-03-05}}</ref> Common patterns do exist, however, allowing experienced readers to make a good guess for most names. To alleviate any confusion on how to pronounce the names of other Japanese people, most official Japanese documents require Japanese to write their names in both kana and kanji.<ref name=\"How do Japanese names work\"/>\n\nChinese place names and [[Chinese personal name]]s appearing in Japanese texts, if spelled in kanji, are almost invariably read with ''on'yomi''. Especially for older and well-known names, the resulting Japanese pronunciation may differ widely from that used by modern Chinese speakers. For example, [[Mao Zedong]]'s name is pronounced as {{nihongo||\u6bdb\u6ca2\u6771|M\u014d Takut\u014d}} in Japanese, and the name of the legendary Monkey King, [[Sun Wukong]], is pronounced ''[[Son Goku (Journey to the West)|Son Gok\u016b]]'' ({{Nihongo2|\u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a}}) in Japanese.\n\nToday, Chinese names that are not well known in Japan are often spelled in [[katakana]] instead, in a form much more closely approximating the native Chinese pronunciation. Alternatively, they may be written in kanji with katakana furigana. Many such cities have names that come from non-[[Chinese language]]s like [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] or [[Manchu language|Manchu]]. Examples of such not-well-known Chinese names include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |English name\n! colspan=\"3\" |Japanese name\n|-\n!R\u014dmaji\n!Katakana\n!Kanji\n|-\n|Harbin\n|''Harubin''\n|\u30cf\u30eb\u30d3\u30f3\n|{{Nihongo2|\u54c8\u723e\u6d5c}}\n|-\n|\u00dcr\u00fcmqi\n|''Urumuchi''\n|\u30a6\u30eb\u30e0\u30c1\n|{{Nihongo2|\u70cf\u9b6f\u6728\u6589}}\n|-\n|Qiqihar\n|''Chichiharu''\n|\u30c1\u30c1\u30cf\u30eb\n|{{Nihongo2|\u6589\u6589\u54c8\u723e}}\n|-\n|Lhasa\n|''Rasa''\n|\u30e9\u30b5\n|{{Nihongo2|\u62c9\u85a9}}\n|}\nInternationally renowned Chinese-named cities tend to imitate the older English pronunciations of their names, regardless of the kanji's ''on'yomi'' or the Mandarin or Cantonese pronunciation, and can be written in either katakana or kanji.

It received this written [[Kaohsiung#Etymology and names|name]] (kanji/Chinese) from Japanese, and later its spoken Mandarin name from the corresponding characters. The English name \"Kaohsiung\" derived from its Mandarin pronunciation. Today it is pronounced either \u30ab\u30aa\u30b7\u30e5\u30f3 or \u30bf\u30ab\u30aa in Japanese.\n*Taipei is generally pronounced \u305f\u3044\u307b\u304f in Japanese.\n\nIn some cases the same kanji can appear in a given word with different readings. Normally this occurs when a character is duplicated and the reading of the second character has voicing (''[[rendaku]]''), as in {{lang|ja|\u4eba\u4eba}} ''hito-bito'' \"people\" (more often written with the [[iteration mark]] as {{Nihongo2|\u4eba\u3005}}), but in rare cases the readings can be unrelated, as in {{nihongo||\u8df3\u3073\u8df3\u306d\u308b|tobi-haneru|\"hop around\", more often written {{lang|ja|\u98db\u3073\u8df3\u306d\u308b}}}}.\n\n===Pronunciation assistance===\nBecause of the ambiguities involved, kanji sometimes have their pronunciation for the given context spelled out in [[ruby character]]s known as ''[[furigana]]'', (small ''[[kana]]'' written above or to the right of the character) or ''kumimoji'' (small ''kana'' written in-line after the character). This is especially true in texts for children or foreign learners. It is also used in [[newspaper]]s and ''[[manga]]'' (comics) for rare or unusual readings, or for situations like the first time a character's name is given, and for characters not included in the officially recognized set of [[j\u014dy\u014d kanji|essential kanji]]. Works of fiction sometimes use ''furigana'' to create new \"words\" by giving normal kanji non-standard readings, or to attach a foreign word rendered in katakana as the reading for a kanji or kanji compound of the same or similar meaning.\n\n===Spelling words===\nConversely, specifying a given kanji, or spelling out a kanji word\u2014whether the pronunciation is known or not\u2014can be complicated, due to the fact that there is not a commonly used standard way to refer to individual kanji (one does not refer to \"kanji #237\"), and that a given reading does not map to a single kanji\u2014indeed there are many homophonous ''words'', not simply individual characters, particularly for ''kango'' (with ''on'yomi''). Easiest is to write the word out\u2014either on paper or tracing it in the air\u2014or look it up (given the pronunciation) in a dictionary, particularly an electronic dictionary; when this is not possible, such as when speaking over the phone or writing implements are not available (and tracing in air is too complicated), various techniques can be used. These include giving ''kun'yomi'' for characters\u2014these are often unique\u2014using a well-known word with the same character (and preferably the same pronunciation and meaning), and describing the character via its components. For example, one may explain how to spell the word {{Nihongo||\u9999\u8f9b\u6599|k\u014dshinry\u014d|spice}} via the words {{Nihongo||\u9999\u308a|kao-ri|fragrance}}, {{Nihongo||\u8f9b\u3044|kara-i|spicy}}, and {{Nihongo||\u98f2\u6599|in-ry\u014d|beverage}}\u2014the first two use the ''kun'yomi'', the third is a well-known compound\u2014saying \"''kaori'', ''karai'', ''ry\u014d'' as in ''inry\u014d''.\"\n\n===Dictionaries===\nIn dictionaries, both words and individual characters have readings glossed, via various conventions. Native words and Sino-Japanese vocabulary are glossed in hiragana (for both ''kun'' and ''on'' readings), while borrowings (''gairaigo'')\u2014including modern borrowings from Chinese\u2014are glossed in katakana; this is the standard writing convention also used in furigana. By contrast, readings for individual characters are conventionally written in katakana for ''on'' readings, and hiragana for ''kun'' readings. Kun readings may further have a separator to indicate which characters are okurigana, and which are considered readings of the character itself. For example, in the entry for {{Nihongo2|\u98df}}, the reading corresponding to the basic verb {{Nihongo|''eat''|\u98df\u3079\u308b|taberu}} may be written as {{lang|ja-Kana|\u305f.\u3079\u308b}} (''ta.beru''), to indicate that ''ta'' is the reading of the character itself. Further, [[kanji dictionary|kanji dictionaries]] often list compounds including irregular readings of a kanji.\n\n==Local developments and divergences from Chinese==\nSince kanji are essentially Chinese ''[[hanzi]]'' used to write Japanese, the majority of characters used in modern Japanese still retain their Chinese meaning, physical resemblance with some of their modern [[traditional Chinese characters]] counterparts, and a degree of similarity with [[Classical Chinese]] pronunciation imported to Japan from 5th to 9th century. Nevertheless, after centuries of development, there is a notable number of kanji used in modern Japanese which have different meaning from ''hanzi'' used in modern Chinese. Such differences are the result of:\n* the use of characters created in Japan,\n* characters that have been given different meanings in Japanese, and \n* post-[[World War II]] simplifications (''[[shinjitai]]'') of the character.\n\nLikewise, the process of [[simplified characters|character simplification]] in [[mainland China]] since the 1950s has resulted in the fact that Japanese speakers who have not studied Chinese may not recognize some simplified characters.\n\n===Kokuji {{anchor|Wasei kanji}} ===\n{{see also|Gukja|Ch\u1eef N\u00f4m|Chinese family of scripts#Adaptations for other languages}}\nIn Japanese, {{nihongo||[[:ja:\u56fd\u5b57|\u56fd\u5b57]]|Kokuji|\"national characters\"}} refers to Chinese characters made outside of China. Specifically, kanji made in Japan are referred to as {{nihongo||\u548c\u88fd\u6f22\u5b57|Wasei kanji}}. They are primarily formed in the usual way of Chinese characters, namely by combining existing components, though using a combination that is not used in China. The corresponding phenomenon in Korea is called ''[[gukja]]'' ({{lang|ko|\u570b\u5b57}}), a cognate name; there are however far fewer Korean-coined characters than Japanese-coined ones. [[Chinese family of scripts#Adaptations for other languages|Other languages]] using the [[Chinese family of scripts]] sometimes have far more extensive systems of native characters, most significantly Vietnamese [[ch\u1eef N\u00f4m]], which comprises over 20,000 characters used throughout traditional Vietnamese writing, and [[Zhuang languages|Zhuang]] [[sawndip]], which comprises over 10,000 characters, which are still in use.\n\nSince kokuji are generally devised for existing native words, these usually only have native [[Kun reading#Kun'yomi (Japanese reading)|''kun'' readings]]. However, they occasionally have a Chinese [[On reading#On'yomi (Sino-Japanese reading)|''on'' reading]], derived from a phonetic, as in {{Nihongo2|\u50cd}}, ''d\u014d'', and in rare cases only have an ''on'' reading, as in {{Nihongo2|\u817a}}, ''sen'', from {{lang|ja|\u6cc9}}, which was derived for use in technical compounds ({{lang|ja|\u817a}} means \"gland\", hence used in medical terminology).\n\nThe majority of kokuji are [[Chinese character classification#Ideogrammatic compounds|ideogrammatic compounds]] ({{lang|ja|\u4f1a\u610f\u5b57}}), meaning that they are composed of two (or more) characters, with the meaning associated with the combination. For example, {{Nihongo2|\u50cd}} is composed of {{Nihongo2|\u4ebb}} (person radical) plus {{Nihongo2|\u52d5}} (action), hence \"action of a person, work\". This is in contrast to kanji generally, which are overwhelmingly phono-semantic compounds. This difference is because kokuji were coined to express Japanese words, so borrowing existing (Chinese) readings could not express these\u2014combining existing characters to logically express the meaning was the simplest way to achieve this.

(October 15, 1969) \"Some Observations on kokuji\" in ''The Journal-Newsletter of the Association of Teachers of Japanese'', Vol. 6, No. 2, pp. 45\u20139.</ref> have been introduced to China. In some cases the Chinese reading is the inferred Chinese reading, interpreting the character as a phono-semantic compound (as in how ''on'' readings are sometimes assigned to these characters in Chinese), while in other cases (such as {{Nihongo2|\u50cd}}), the Japanese ''on'' reading is borrowed (in general this differs from the modern Chinese pronunciation of this phonetic). Similar coinages occurred to a more limited extent in Korea and Vietnam.\n\nHistorically, some kokuji date back to very early Japanese writing, being found in the ''[[Man'y\u014dsh\u016b]]'', for example\u2014{{Nihongo2|\u9c2f}} ''iwashi'' \"sardine\" dates to the [[Nara period]] (8th century)\u2014while they have continued to be created as late as the late 19th century, when a number of characters were coined in the [[Meiji era]] for new scientific concepts. For example, some characters were produced as regular compounds for some (but not all) SI units, such as {{Nihongo2|\u7c81}} ({{Nihongo2|\u7c73}} \"meter\" + {{Nihongo2|\u5343}} \"thousand, kilo-\") for kilometer, {{Nihongo2|\u7acf}} ({{Nihongo2|\u7acb}} \"liter\" + {{Nihongo2|\u5343}} \"thousand, kilo-\") for kiloliter, and {{Nihongo2|\u74e9}} ({{Nihongo2|\u74e6}} \"gram\" + \"thousand, kilo-\") for kilogram\u2014see [[International System of Units#Chinese and Japanese|Chinese characters for SI units]] for details. However, SI units in Japanese today are almost exclusively written using r\u014dmaji or katakana such as {{Nihongo2|\u30ad\u30ed\u30e1\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb}} or {{Nihongo2|\u3316}} for km, {{Nihongo2|\u30ad\u30ed\u30ea\u30c3\u30c8\u30eb}} for kl, and {{Nihongo2|\u30ad\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0}} or {{Nihongo2|\u3315}} for kg.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/kokuji-list.html|title=A list of kokuji (\u56fd\u5b57)|website=www.sljfaq.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-05}}</ref>\n\nIn Japan the kokuji category is strictly defined as characters whose ''earliest'' appearance is in Japan. If a character appears earlier in the Chinese literature, it is not considered a kokuji even if the character was independently coined in Japan and unrelated to the Chinese character (meaning \"not borrowed from Chinese\"). In other words, kokuji are not simply characters that were made in Japan, but characters that were ''first'' made in Japan. An illustrative example is {{Nihongo||\u9b9f\u9c47|ank\u014d|[[monkfish]]}}. This spelling was created in Edo period Japan from the [[ateji]] (phonetic kanji spelling) {{Nihongo2|\u5b89\u5eb7}} for the existing word ''ank\u014d'' by adding the {{Nihongo2|\u9b5a}} radical to each character\u2014the characters were \"made in Japan\". However, {{Nihongo2|\u9b9f}} is not considered kokuji, as it is found in ancient Chinese texts as a corruption of {{lang|zh-hant|\u9c0b}} (\u9b5a\u533d). {{Nihongo2|\u9c47}} is considered kokuji, as it has not been found in any earlier Chinese text. Casual listings may be more inclusive, including characters such as {{Nihongo2|\u9b9f}}.<ref>[http://www.kanjijiten.net/japanese.html {{Nihongo2|\u56fd\u5b57}}] at [http://www.kanjijiten.net/ {{Nihongo2|\u6f22\u5b57\u8f9e\u5178\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8}}] demonstrates this, listing both {{Nihongo2|\u9b9f}} and {{Nihongo2|\u9c47}} as kokuji, but starring {{Nihongo2|\u9b9f}} and stating that dictionaries do not consider it to be a kokuji.</ref> Another example is {{Nihongo2|\u643e}}, which is sometimes not considered kokuji due to its earlier presence as a corruption of Chinese {{lang|zh-hant|\u69a8}}.\n\n===Kokkun===\nIn addition to ''kokuji'', there are kanji that have been given meanings in Japanese different from their original Chinese meanings. These are not considered ''kokuji'' but are instead called ''kok{{zwnj}}[[#kunyomi|kun]]'' ({{Nihongo2|\u56fd\u8a13}}) and include characters such as the following:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 |  {{abbr|Char.|Character (both Kanji and Hanzi)}} !! colspan=2 | Japanese !! colspan=22 | Chinese\n|-\n!

The traditional classification is still taught but is problematic and no longer the focus of modern lexicographic practice, as some categories are not clearly defined, nor are they mutually exclusive: the first four refer to structural composition, while the last two refer to usage.\n\n===''Sh\u014dkei moji'' ({{Nihongo2|\u8c61\u5f62\u6587\u5b57}})===\n''Sh\u014dkei'' (Mandarin: ''xi\u00e0ngx\u00edng'') characters are [[pictograph]]ic sketches of the object they represent. For example, {{Nihongo2|\u76ee}} is an eye, while {{Nihongo2|\u6728}} is a tree. The current forms of the characters are very different from the originals, though their representations are more clear in [[oracle bone script]] and [[seal script]]. These pictographic characters make up only a small fraction of modern characters.\n\n===''Shiji moji'' ({{Nihongo2|\u6307\u4e8b\u6587\u5b57}})===\n''Shiji'' (Mandarin: ''zh\u01d0sh\u00ec'') characters are [[ideograph]]s, often called \"simple ideographs\" or \"simple indicatives\" to distinguish them and tell the difference from compound ideographs (below). They are usually simple graphically and represent an abstract concept such as {{Nihongo2|\u4e0a}} \"up\" or \"above\" and {{Nihongo2|\u4e0b}} \"down\" or \"below\". These make up a tiny fraction of modern characters.\n\n===''Kaii moji'' ({{Nihongo2|\u4f1a\u610f\u6587\u5b57}})===\n''Kaii'' (Mandarin: ''hu\u00ecy\u00ec'') characters are compound ideographs, often called \"compound indicatives\", \"associative compounds\", or just \"ideographs\". These are usually a combination of pictographs that combine semantically to present an overall meaning. An example of this type is {{Nihongo2|\u4f11}} (rest) from {{Nihongo2|\u4ebb}} (person radical) and {{Nihongo2|\u6728}} (tree).  Another is the ''kokuji'' {{Nihongo2|\u5ce0}} (mountain pass) made from {{Nihongo2|\u5c71}} (mountain), {{Nihongo2|\u4e0a}} (up) and {{Nihongo2|\u4e0b}} (down). These make up a tiny fraction of modern characters.\n\n===''Keisei moji'' ({{Nihongo2|\u5f62\u58f0\u6587\u5b57}})===\n''Keisei'' (Mandarin: ''x\u00edngsh\u0113ng'') characters are phono-semantic or [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]]-phonetic compounds, sometimes called \"semantic-phonetic\", \"semasio-phonetic\", or \"phonetic-ideographic\" characters, are by far the largest category, making up about 90% of the characters in the standard lists; however, some of the most frequently used kanji belong to one of the three groups mentioned above, so ''keisei moji'' will usually make up less than 90% of the characters in a text. Typically they are made up of two components, one of which (most commonly, but by no means always, the left or top element) suggests the general category of the meaning or semantic context, and the other (most commonly the right or bottom element) approximates the pronunciation. The pronunciation relates to the original Chinese, and may now only be distantly detectable in the modern Japanese ''on'yomi'' of the kanji; it generally has no relation at all to ''kun'yomi''. The same is true of the semantic context, which may have changed over the centuries or in the transition from Chinese to Japanese. As a result, it is a common error in folk etymology to fail to recognize a phono-semantic compound, typically instead inventing a compound-indicative explanation.\n\n===''Tench\u016b moji'' ({{Nihongo2|\u8ee2\u6ce8\u6587\u5b57}})===\n''Tench\u016b'' (Mandarin: ''zhu\u01cenzh\u00f9'') characters have variously been called \"derivative characters\", \"derivative [[cognate]]s\", or translated as \"mutually explanatory\" or \"mutually synonymous\" characters; this is the most problematic of the six categories, as it is vaguely defined. It may refer to kanji where the meaning or application has become extended. For example, {{Nihongo2|\u697d}} is used for 'music' and 'comfort, ease', with different pronunciations in Chinese reflected in the two different ''on'yomi'', ''gaku'' 'music' and ''raku'' 'pleasure'.\n\n===''Kasha moji'' ({{Nihongo2|\u4eee\u501f\u6587\u5b57}})===\n''Kasha'' (Mandarin: ''ji\u01ceji\u00e8'') are [[rebus]]es, sometimes called \"phonetic loans\". The etymology of the characters follows one of the patterns above, but the present-day meaning is completely unrelated to this. A character was appropriated to represent a similar-sounding word. For example, {{Nihongo2|\u6765}} in ancient Chinese was originally a pictograph for \"wheat\". Its syllable was homophonous with the verb meaning \"to come\", and the character is used for that verb as a result, without any embellishing \"meaning\" element attached. The character for wheat {{Nihongo2|\u9ea6}}, originally meant \"to come\", being a ''keisei moji'' having 'foot' at the bottom for its meaning part and \"wheat\" at the top for sound. The two characters swapped meaning, so today the more common word has the simpler character. This borrowing of sounds has a very long history.\n\n==Related symbols==\n{{see also | Japanese typographic symbols}}\n\nThe [[iteration mark]] ({{Nihongo2|\u3005}}) is used to indicate that the preceding kanji is to be repeated, functioning similarly to a [[ditto mark]] in English. It is pronounced as though the kanji were written twice in a row, for example {{Nihongo||{{linktext|\u8272\u3005}}|iroiro|\"various\"}} and {{Nihongo||\u6642\u3005|tokidoki|\"sometimes\"}}. This mark also appears in personal and place names, as in the [[Japanese name|surname]] Sasaki ({{lang|ja|\u4f50\u3005\u6728}}). This symbol is a simplified version of the kanji {{Nihongo2|\u4edd}}, a variant of {{Nihongo||\u540c|d\u014d|\"same\"}}.\n\nAnother abbreviated symbol is {{Nihongo2|[[\u30f6]]}}, in appearance a small [[katakana]] \"ke\", but actually a simplified version of the kanji {{Nihongo2|\u7b87}}, a general counter. It is pronounced \"ka\" when used to indicate quantity (such as {{lang|ja|\u516d\u30f6\u6708}}, ''rok'''ka'''getsu'' \"six months\") or \"ga\" in place names like {{Nihongo|[[Kasumigaseki]]|\u971e\u30f6\u95a2}}.\n\nThe way how these symbols may be produced on a computer depends on the operating system. In OS X, typing{{Nihongo2|\u300c\u3058\u304a\u304f\u308a\u300d}}will reveal the symbol {{Nihongo2|\u3005}} as well as {{Nihongo2|\u30fd}}, {{Nihongo2|\u309d}} and {{Nihongo2|\u309e}}. To produce {{Nihongo2|\u303b}}, type {{Nihongo2|\u300c\u304a\u3069\u308a\u3058\u300d}}. Under Windows, typing{{Nihongo2|\u300c\u304f\u308a\u304b\u3048\u3057\u300d}}will reveal some of these symbols, while in Google IME,{{Nihongo2|\u300c\u304a\u3069\u308a\u3058\u300d}}may be used.\n\n==Collation==\nKanji, whose thousands of symbols defy ordering by conventions such as those used for the [[Latin script]], are often [[collation|collated]] using the traditional Chinese [[radical-and-stroke sorting]] method. In this system, common components of characters are identified; these are called [[radical (Chinese character)|radicals]]. Characters are grouped by their primary radical, then ordered by number of pen strokes within radicals. For example, the kanji character {{Nihongo2|\u685c}}, meaning \"cherry\", is sorted as a ten-stroke character under the four-stroke primary radical {{lang|ja|\u6728}} meaning \"tree\". When there is no obvious radical or more than one radical, convention governs which is used for collation.\n\nOther kanji sorting methods, such as the [[Kodansha Kanji Learner's Dictionary#SKIP|SKIP]] system, have been devised by various authors.\n\nModern general-purpose [[Japanese dictionaries]] (as opposed to specifically character dictionaries) generally collate all entries, including words written using kanji, according to their [[kana]] representations (reflecting the way they are pronounced). The [[goj\u016bon]] ordering of kana is normally used for this purpose.\n\n==Kanji education==\n[[File:3002_Kanji.svg|thumb|An image that lists most joyo-kanji, according to [[Kodansha Kanji Learner's Dictionary|Halpern's KKLD indexing system]], with kyo-iku kanji color-coded by grade level.]]\n\nJapanese school children are expected to learn 1006 basic kanji characters, the ''[[ky\u014diku kanji]]'', before finishing the sixth grade. The order in which these characters are learned is fixed. The ''ky\u014diku kanji'' list is a subset of a larger list, originally of 1,945 kanji characters and extended to 2,136 in 2010, are known as the ''[[j\u014dy\u014d kanji]]''\u2014characters required for the level of fluency necessary to read newspapers and literature in Japanese. This larger list of characters is to be mastered by the end of the ninth grade.<ref>Halpern, J. (2006) ''The Kodansha Kanji Learner's Dictionary''. {{ISBN|1568364075}}. p. 38a.</ref> Schoolchildren learn the characters by repetition and [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]].\n\nStudents studying Japanese as a foreign language are often required by a curriculum to acquire kanji without having first learned the vocabulary associated with them. Strategies for these learners vary from copying-based methods to [[mnemonic]]-based methods such as those used in [[James Heisig]]'s series ''[[Remembering the Kanji]]''. Other textbooks use methods based on the [[etymology]] of the characters, such as Mathias and Habein's ''The Complete Guide to Everyday Kanji'' and Henshall's ''A Guide to Remembering Japanese Characters''. Pictorial [[mnemonics]], as in the text ''Kanji Pict-o-graphix'', are also seen.\n\nThe [[Japanese government]] provides the ''[[Kanji kentei]]'' ({{Nihongo2|\u65e5\u672c\u6f22\u5b57\u80fd\u529b\u691c\u5b9a\u8a66\u9a13}} ''Nihon kanji n\u014dryoku kentei shiken''; \"Test of Japanese Kanji Aptitude\"), which tests the ability to read and write kanji. The highest level of the ''Kanji kentei'' tests about six thousand kanji.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Braille kanji]]\n* [[Chinese influence on Japanese culture]]\n* [[Han unification]]\n* [[Han-Nom]] (Vietnamese equivalent)\n* [[Hanja]] (Korean equivalent)\n* [[Chinese family of scripts]]\n* [[Japanese script reform]]\n* [[Japanese typefaces]] (''shotai'')\n* [[Japanese writing system]]\n* [[Kanji of the year]]\n* [[List of kanji by concept]]\n* [[List of kanji by stroke count]]\n* [[POP (Point of Purchase typeface)]]\n* [[Radical (Chinese character)]]\n* [[Stroke order]]\n* [[Table of Japanese kanji radicals|Table of kanji radicals]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n* DeFrancis, John (1990).
