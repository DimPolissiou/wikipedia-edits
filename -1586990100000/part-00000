For example, he said, a civil marriage is better than simply living together, because it signifies a couple has made a formal, public commitment to one another. \"Instead of talking about everything that is missing, we can draw close to this reality, noting what is positive in this love that is establishing itself.\" Sch\u00f6nborn described a gay friend of his who, after many temporary relationships, is now in a stable relationship. \"It's an improvement. They share \"a life, they share their joys and sufferings, they help one another. It must be recognised that this person took an important step for his own good and the good of others, even though it certainly is not a situation the Church can consider 'regular'.\" The Church's negative \"judgment about homosexual acts is necessary, but the Church should not look in the bedroom first, but in the dining room! It must accompany people.\" He said that pastoral accompaniment \"cannot transform an irregular situation into a regular one, but there do exist paths for healing, for learning,\" for moving gradually closer to a situation in compliance with Church teaching.<ref>{{cite news | work = Catholic Herald |  date= 11 September 2015 | url = http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2015/09/11/stable-gay-relationship-is-better-than-a-temporary-one-says-cardinal-schonborn/ |first = Cindy | last= Wooden | title = Stable gay relationship is better than a \u2018temporary\u2019 one, says Cardinal Sch\u00f6nborn |access-date = 22 January 2020 }}</ref>\n\n===HIV/AIDS and condoms===\nIn 1996, Sch\u00f6nborn told an Austrian television audience that someone suffering from AIDS might use a condom as a \"lesser evil\", but he quickly cautioned, \"no one could affirm that the use of a condom is the ideal in sexual relations.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/features/index.cfm?recnum=281 |title=News Features |publisher=Catholic Culture |date= |accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Mozart, Catholicism and Freemasonry===\nAccording to Eric Leitenberger, Sch\u00f6nborn's spokesman, the cardinal's position is that [[Mozart and Freemasonry|Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] was a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]], but that he was also fully Catholic.\n\n===Evolution and the Catholic Church===\nIn an opinion piece that appeared in the ''[[New York Times]]'' on 7 July 2005,<ref>{{cite news | first =Christoph | last = Sch\u00f6nborn | url = http://www.millerandlevine.com/km/evol/catholic/schonborn-NYTimes.html  | title= Finding Design in Nature | work = New York Times | date= 7 July 2005 | access-date = 21 January 2020}}</ref> Sch\u00f6nborn accepted the possibility of [[evolution]] but criticised certain [[Neo-Darwinism|\"neo-Darwinian\"]] theories as incompatible with Catholic teaching:\n\n{{quote|Evolution in the sense of common ancestry might be true, but evolution in the neo-Darwinian sense \u2013 an unguided, unplanned process of [[random variation]] and [[natural selection]] \u2013 is not.

{"title_page": "W. J. Ghent", "text_new": "'''William James Ghent''' (1866\u20131942) was an [[United States of America|American]] [[Socialism|socialist]] journalist and writer. His main focus was on socialism and on the history of the [[Westward Expansion]] of the early United States.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\n\nWilliam James Ghent was born on April 29, 1866 in [[Frankfort, Indiana|Frankfort]], [[Clinton County, Indiana]] the son of Ira Keith Ghent and Mary Elizabeth Palmer.<ref>Ira and Mary Palmer Ghent family Bible</ref> Ghent's ancestors had already been residents of America for a century, having settled in the state of [[North Carolina]] prior to the [[American Revolution]].<ref name=Cornell29>Frederick Cornell, ''A History of the Rand School of Social Science \u2014 1906 to 1956.''

Ghent would go on to contribute to such publications as the New York-based magazine ''The American Fabian'' from 1897 to 1898.<ref name=LoC>[http://rs5.loc.gov/service/mss/eadxmlmss/eadpdfmss/2013/ms013027.pdf ''William J.

Robert Constantine (ed.), ''Letters of Eugene V. Debs: Volume 1, 1874-1912.'' Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1990; pg. 272.</ref>\n\nOn March 6, 1903, the Collectivist Society of New York was organized.  Ghent was a member of its executive committee.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ghent |first=W. J. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3r0JAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA89 |title=The Collectivist Society |work=The Commons, Volume 9 |pages=89 }}</ref>\n\nGhent remained aloof from the organized socialist movement for more than a decade, finally joining the [[Socialist Party of America]] (SPA) in 1904.<ref name=Bliss /> At the time of his entry into the SPA, Ghent was already well known among American socialists for his authorship of the widely read radical tome ''Our Benevolent Feudalism'' (1902).<ref name=LoC /> He soon followed this with another well recognized volume, 1904's ''Mass and Class.''<ref name=Cornell30>Cornell, ''A History of the Rand School of Social Science,'' pg. 30.</ref>\n\nGhent was recognized as an excellent writer but was shy and a poor public speaker.<ref name=Cornell30 /> The disconnect between his literary eloquence and reluctance to speak in public caused many of those who came into casual contact with Ghent to think him aloof.<ref name=Cornell30 />\n\nIn 1906 with funds provided by [[philanthropist]] Caroline A. Sherfey Rand, a socialist [[workers education movement|workers education]] facility was launched in [[New York City]] called the [[Rand School of Social Science]]. An April 1906 meeting of the Board of Directors determined that the hiring of a paid executive to run the school was required and Ghent was nominated for the post.<ref name=Schwartz96>Rachel Cutler Schwartz, ''The Rand School of Social Science, 1906-1924: A Study of Worker Education in the Socialist Era.'' PhD dissertation. State University of New York at Buffalo, 1984; pg. 96.</ref> Although he feared that this job would take away time necessary for writing, Ghent finally relented and took the position as Secretary.<ref name=Schwartz96 /> Ghent and the Rand School set up shop on the first two floors of a building located at 112 East 19th Street and the school officially opened in September of that same year.<ref>Schwartz, ''The Rand School of Social Science, 1906-1924,'' pp. 97-99.</ref>\n\nAs an intellectual, the activities of the [[Intercollegiate Socialist Society]] (ISS) in bringing socialist ideas to college campuses held great appeal for Ghent and he became Secretary of that organization.<ref name=Schwartz102>Schwartz, ''The Rand School of Social Science, 1906-1924,'' pg. 102.</ref> In the summer of 1907 Ghent made the facility of the recently Rand School the headquarters of the ISS as well.<ref name=Schwartz102 />\n\nOver time personal friction developed between Ghent and [[Algernon Lee]], editor of ''The Worker,'' the main English-language Socialist weekly in New York City and Ghent was pushed into resigning as the school's chief in the fall of 1909.<ref>Schwartz, ''The Rand School of Social Science, 1906-1924,'' pg. 104.</ref> Ghent was effectively pushed upstairs, elected as President of the Board of Directors of the American Socialist Society, the legal entity behind the Rand School, and Algernon Lee was elected as the school's new Secretary.<ref>Schwartz, ''The Rand School of Social Science, 1906-1924,'' pg. 105.</ref>\n\nIn 1911 Ghent left for [[Washington, DC]], to work as a secretary to Socialist Congressman [[Victor L. Berger]].<ref name=DL /> Following his stint with Rep. Berger, Ghent returned to journalism, contributing to the Washington, DC socialist weekly ''The National Socialist'' before moving to the Southeastern Kansas town of [[Girard, Kansas|Girard]] to join the editorial staff of the mass circulation ''[[Appeal to Reason (newspaper)|Appeal to Reason]].''\n\n===Break with radicalism===\n\nGhent broke with the Socialist Party over that organization's staunch opposition to [[World War I]] despite of America's entry into that conflict in April 1917. Ghent became active in the pro-war arm of the labor movement, joining [[American Federation of Labor]] President [[Samuel Gompers]] on the Executive Committee of the [[American Alliance for Labor and Democracy]] from 1917 through 1919.<ref name=LoC />\n\nIn the early 1920s Ghent emerged as an outspoken public opponent of the fledgling American Communist movement. In 1923 [[Princeton University Press]] gathered a modified set of his essays from such magazines as ''The Weekly Review'' and ''The Independent'' under hard covers as a book entitled ''The Reds Bring Reaction.''<ref>W.J. Ghent, ''The Reds Bring Reaction.'' Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1923; pp. v-vi.</ref> Ghent argued in this book that the ongoing wave of conservatism and anti-union legislation which swept America in the years after [[World War I]] was in large measure a response to the \"theatricism and charlantry\" of the revolutionary left.<ref name=RBRvii>Ghent, ''The Reds Bring Reaction,'' pg. vii.</ref>\n\nGhent wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"The revolutionary Communist, for all his stage-play, is a fanatic and a firebrand. So long as society insists upon keeping on hand such stores of inflammable material in the form of large sections of the working class steeped in privation and misery, it must expect, from time to time, what follows from the touch of flame to tinder. But the chief danger lies in the fact that the tumult and shouting of the Left inevitably strengthens the Reaction of the Right.<ref name=RBRvii /></blockquote>\n\nDespite this perspective and his continued separation from the Socialist Party, Ghent reaffirmed his commitment to the principles of [[social democracy]], declaring that \"the theory of the [[class struggle]]...seemed to be valid, when rightfully understood, as it still seems,\" despite the fact that \"the abuse of that theory might well set the world in flames.\"<ref>Ghent, ''The Reds Bring Reaction,'' pp. xii-xiii.</ref>\n\nGhent gradually became estranged from the radical political movement, turning his attention to the history of the American West. He would be the author of three monographs on the topic. Although he never rejoined the Socialist Party of America, he did in 1936 join the [[Social Democratic Federation (U.S.)|Social Democratic Federation]], which was established in a split by party moderates from the SPA.<ref name=Cornell31>Cornell, ''A History of the Rand School of Social Science,'' pg. 31.</ref>\n\n===Death and legacy===\n\nW.J. Ghent died on July 10, 1942 in Washington, DC.<ref name=Cornell31 /> Ghent's papers reside with the Manuscript Division of the [[Library of Congress]] in Washington.<ref name=LoC />\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Works==\n* [https://archive.org/details/ourbenevolentfeu00ghenrich ''Our Benevolent Feudalism.''] New York: Macmillan, 1902.\n* [https://archive.org/details/cu31924002634958 ''Mass and Class: A Survey of Social Divisions.''] New York: Macmillan, 1904.\n* ''Why Aren't You a Socialist?''

His main focus was on socialism and on the history of the [[Westward Expansion]] of the early United States.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\n\nWilliam James Ghent was born on April 29, 1866 in [[Frankfort, Indiana|Frankfort]], [[Clinton County, Indiana]] the son of Ira Keith Ghent and Mary Elizabeth Palmer.<ref>Ira and Mary Palmer Ghent family Bible</ref> Ghent's ancestors had already been residents of America for a century, having settled in the state of [[North Carolina]] prior to the [[American Revolution]].<ref name=Cornell29>Frederick Cornell, ''A History of the Rand School of Social Science \u2014 1906 to 1956.''

Bliss (ed.), ''The New Cyclopedia of Social Reform.'' New Edition. New York: Funk and Wagnalls, 1908; pg. 541.</ref>\n\n===Socialist activities===\n\nGhent became interested in [[socialism]] in 1892, becoming active in a [[Nationalist Clubs|Bellamy Club]],<ref name=Cornell29 /> and initially espoused the English evolutionary socialist ideas of [[Fabianism]]. Ghent would go on to contribute to such publications as the New York-based magazine ''The American Fabian'' from 1897 to 1898.<ref name=LoC>[http://rs5.loc.gov/service/mss/eadxmlmss/eadpdfmss/2013/ms013027.pdf ''William J.

Robert Constantine (ed.), ''Letters of Eugene V. Debs: Volume 1, 1874-1912.'' Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1990; pg. 272.</ref>\n\nOn March 6, 1903, the Collectivist Society of New York was organized.  Ghent was a member of its executive committee.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ghent |first=W. J. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3r0JAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA89 |title=The Collectivist Society |work=The Commons, Volume 9 |pages=89 }}</ref>\n\nGhent remained aloof from the organized socialist movement for more than a decade, finally joining the [[Socialist Party of America]] (SPA) in 1904.<ref name=Bliss /> At the time of his entry into the SPA, Ghent was already well known among American socialists for his authorship of the widely read radical tome ''Our Benevolent Feudalism'' (1902).<ref name=LoC /> He soon followed this with another well recognized volume, 1904's ''Mass and Class.''<ref name=Cornell30>Cornell, ''A History of the Rand School of Social Science,'' pg. 30.</ref>\n\nGhent was recognized as an excellent writer but was shy and a poor public speaker.<ref name=Cornell30 /> The disconnect between his literary eloquence and reluctance to speak in public caused many of those who came into casual contact with Ghent to think him aloof.<ref name=Cornell30 />\n\nIn 1906 with funds provided by [[philanthropist]] Caroline A. Sherfey Rand, a socialist [[workers education movement|workers education]] facility was launched in [[New York City]] called the [[Rand School of Social Science]]. An April 1906 meeting of the Board of Directors determined that the hiring of a paid executive to run the school was required and Ghent was nominated for the post.<ref name=Schwartz96>Rachel Cutler Schwartz, ''The Rand School of Social Science, 1906-1924: A Study of Worker Education in the Socialist Era.'' PhD dissertation. State University of New York at Buffalo, 1984; pg. 96.</ref> Although he feared that this job would take away time necessary for writing, Ghent finally relented and took the position as Secretary.<ref name=Schwartz96 /> Ghent and the Rand School set up shop on the first two floors of a building located at 112 East 19th Street and the school officially opened in September of that same year.<ref>Schwartz, ''The Rand School of Social Science, 1906-1924,'' pp. 97-99.</ref>\n\nAs an intellectual, the activities of the [[Intercollegiate Socialist Society]] (ISS) in bringing socialist ideas to college campuses held great appeal for Ghent and he became Secretary of that organization.<ref name=Schwartz102>Schwartz, ''The Rand School of Social Science, 1906-1924,'' pg. 102.</ref> In the summer of 1907 Ghent made the facility of the recently Rand School the headquarters of the ISS as well.<ref name=Schwartz102 />\n\nOver time personal friction developed between Ghent and [[Algernon Lee]], editor of ''The Worker,'' the main English-language Socialist weekly in New York City and Ghent was pushed into resigning as the school's chief in the fall of 1909.<ref>Schwartz, ''The Rand School of Social Science, 1906-1924,'' pg. 104.</ref> Ghent was effectively pushed upstairs, elected as President of the Board of Directors of the American Socialist Society, the legal entity behind the Rand School, and Algernon Lee was elected as the school's new Secretary.<ref>Schwartz, ''The Rand School of Social Science, 1906-1924,'' pg. 105.</ref>\n\nIn 1911 Ghent left for [[Washington, DC]], to work as a secretary to Socialist Congressman [[Victor L. Berger]].<ref name=DL /> Following his stint with Rep. Berger, Ghent returned to journalism, contributing to the Washington, DC socialist weekly ''The National Socialist'' before moving to the Southeastern Kansas town of [[Girard, Kansas|Girard]] to join the editorial staff of the mass circulation ''[[Appeal to Reason (newspaper)|Appeal to Reason]].''\n\n===Break with radicalism===\n\nGhent broke with the Socialist Party over that organization's staunch opposition to [[World War I]] despite of America's entry into that conflict in April 1917. Ghent became active in the pro-war arm of the labor movement, joining [[American Federation of Labor]] President [[Samuel Gompers]] on the Executive Committee of the [[American Alliance for Labor and Democracy]] from 1917 through 1919.<ref name=LoC />\n\nIn the early 1920s Ghent emerged as an outspoken public opponent of the fledgling American Communist movement. In 1923 [[Princeton University Press]] gathered a modified set of his essays from such magazines as ''The Weekly Review'' and ''The Independent'' under hard covers as a book entitled ''The Reds Bring Reaction.''<ref>W.J. Ghent, ''The Reds Bring Reaction.'' Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1923; pp. v-vi.</ref> Ghent argued in this book that the ongoing wave of conservatism and anti-union legislation which swept America in the years after [[World War I]] was in large measure a response to the \"theatricism and charlantry\" of the revolutionary left.<ref name=RBRvii>Ghent, ''The Reds Bring Reaction,'' pg. vii.</ref>\n\nGhent wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"The revolutionary Communist, for all his stage-play, is a fanatic and a firebrand. So long as society insists upon keeping on hand such stores of inflammable material in the form of large sections of the working class steeped in privation and misery, it must expect, from time to time, what follows from the touch of flame to tinder. But the chief danger lies in the fact that the tumult and shouting of the Left inevitably strengthens the Reaction of the Right.<ref name=RBRvii /></blockquote>\n\nDespite this perspective and his continued separation from the Socialist Party, Ghent reaffirmed his commitment to the principles of [[social democracy]], declaring that \"the theory of the [[class struggle]]...seemed to be valid, when rightfully understood, as it still seems,\" despite the fact that \"the abuse of that theory might well set the world in flames.\"<ref>Ghent, ''The Reds Bring Reaction,'' pp. xii-xiii.</ref>\n\nGhent gradually became estranged from the radical political movement, turning his attention to the history of the American West. He would be the author of three monographs on the topic. Although he never rejoined the Socialist Party of America, he did in 1936 join the [[Social Democratic Federation (U.S.)|Social Democratic Federation]], which was established in a split by party moderates from the SPA.<ref name=Cornell31>Cornell, ''A History of the Rand School of Social Science,'' pg. 31.</ref>\n\n===Death and legacy===\n\nW.J. Ghent died on July 10, 1942 in Washington, DC.<ref name=Cornell31 /> Ghent's papers reside with the Manuscript Division of the [[Library of Congress]] in Washington.<ref name=LoC />\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Works==\n* [https://archive.org/details/ourbenevolentfeu00ghenrich ''Our Benevolent Feudalism.''] New York: Macmillan, 1902.\n* [https://archive.org/details/cu31924002634958 ''Mass and Class: A Survey of Social Divisions.''] New York: Macmillan, 1904.\n* ''Why Aren't You a Socialist?''

This bank later merged with others in 1896 to become [[Barclays Bank]] of which he was a main board director until his death.\n\nIn 1875, he married Mary Alma Victoria Agnew (1854\u20131923), the daughter of [[Sir Andrew Agnew, 8th Baronet]], and Lady Mary Noel, and had seven children,<ref>{{cite web|title=Arthur Fitzgerald Kinnaird, 11th Baron Kinnaird|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p8023.htm#i80226|publisher=ThePeerage.com}}</ref> including:\n\n* Douglas Arthur Kinnaird, who was born on 20 August 1879 and served during the [[First World War]] as a Captain in the 1st Battalion of the [[Scots Guards]]; he died on 24 October 1914 and is buried at [[Ypres]] in [[Belgium]].\n* Kenneth Fitzgerald Kinnaird (1880\u20131972), who inherited his father's titles; he married Frances Clifton (1876\u20131960) and was the father of Graham Charles Kinnaird (1912\u20131997), 13th Lord Kinnaird, upon whose death the titles became dormant.\n* Arthur Middleton Kinnaird, who was born on 20 April 1885 and served as a Lieutenant in the 1st Battalion of the Scots Guards; he died on  27 November 1917 and is buried at [[Ruyaulcourt]].\n* Patrick Kinnaird (1898\u20131948), who married, in 1912, Margaret Stella Wright (div.) and, in 1925, Violet Sandford.\n\n== Football career ==\n===Player===\nKinnaird first played football while at [[Cheam School]] and was captain of the school team in 1859, aged 12, for a match against [[Harrow School]]. He continued to play football at [[Eton College]], winning the House Cup in 1861 with Joynes's House, but was never selected for the school eleven. He first played association football early in 1866.\n\nAs a player, Kinnaird had a remarkable record in the [[FA Cup]]. He played in a record nine FA Cup finals. He was on the winning side three times with [[Wanderers F.C.|Wanderers]] and twice with the [[Old Etonians F.C.|Old Etonians]], and celebrated his fifth Cup Final victory by standing on his head in front of the pavilion. In the course of his career as a Cup Final player, Kinnaird played in every position, from goalkeeper to forward. It was while playing in goal for Wanderers in the [[1877 FA Cup Final|1877 final]] that he suffered the indignity of scoring the first significant [[own goal]] in football history, accidentally stepping backwards over his own goal line after fielding an innocuous long shot from an [[Oxford University A.F.C.|Oxford University]] forward.  The match finished 1\u20131 and Wanderers won with a second goal in extra time.  Some time after the match, for unknown reasons, the FA struck the Oxford goal from the records, changing the official score to 2\u20130 (although if Oxford had not scored, there would have been no reason for the game to go to extra time, so by rights they should have annulled Wanderers' second goal as well).<ref name=\"W47\">{{cite book |last= Warsop|first= Keith|title= The Early FA Cup Finals and the Southern Amateurs|year= 2004|publisher= SoccerData|isbn= 1-899468-78-1 |page=47}}</ref>  For the next century, all sources reported the score of the match as 2\u20130.<ref name=\"W47\" />  In the 1980s, after fresh research into contemporary reports of the game by football historians, the FA reinstated the Oxford goal, and now regard the official final score of the 1877 final as 2\u20131.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/CupFinalResults.aspx|archive-url=https://archive.is/20090616021730/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/CupFinalResults.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 June 2009|title=Cup Final Statistics|publisher=The Football Association|accessdate=30 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nAlthough he was born in [[Kensington]], London, as a son of an old [[Perthshire]] family, Kinnaird also played for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]].<ref name = rsssf/> He made his solitary appearance against [[England national football team|England]] in the second ever international match, played on 8 March 1873 at [[The Oval]].<ref name = rsssf>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/scot-intres1880.html |title=Scotland \u2013 International Matches 1872\u20131880 |website= |publisher=RSSSF |date=19 September 2019 |accessdate=21 March 2020 |first1=Alan |last1=Brown |first2=Gabriele |last2=Tossani}}</ref>\n\n====Playing style====\n[[File:Arthur Fitzgerald Kinnaird.jpg|thumb|130px|Caricature of Kinnaird published in 1912]]\nHe was renowned as perhaps the toughest tackler of his day, giving rise to the (probably apocryphal) story that his wife once expressed the fear that he would \"come home one day with a broken leg.\" A friend is said to have responded: \"You must not worry, madam. If he does, it will not be his own.\" Posterity has awarded Arthur Kinnaird the reputation of being fond of '[[Hacking (rugby)|hacking]]', i.e. deliberately kicking his opponents. This is not entirely fair: reports from his playing days do not criticise him, and he owes his notoriety to an oft-repeated anecdote which first appeared in an October 1892 issue of ''Pastime'' magazine, a weekly sporting journal that was edited by [[Nicholas Lane Jackson|Nicholas Lane 'Pa' Jackson]], founder of the [[Corinthian_F.C.|Corinthian Football Club]] and a committee member of the Football Association.\n\nJackson wrote: 'The keen rivalry which at one time existed between the Old Etonians and Old Harrovians lent an additional zest to the matches between them, and in one of these Lord Kinnaird's energy was expended as much on the shins of his opponents as on the ball. This at length caused a protest from the captain of the Harrovians, who asked, 'Are we going to play the game, or are we going to have hacking?'  'Oh, let us have hacking!' was the noble reply.' Jackson later reveals that the opposing captain was [[C. W. Alcock|Charles Alcock]], which pinpoints the likely origin of the anecdote to a game on 16 November 1872, described as 'a friendly, but most vicious game of football' by The Graphic newspaper. Alcock and [[Morton Peto Betts]] were sufficiently disabled to be unable to play for England in the first official international, two weeks later.\n\nSportswriters and fellow internationals queued to pay tribute to Kinnaird's skill as a footballer both during and after his career. He was, according to \"Tityrus\" (J.A.H. Catton), editor of the ''Athletic News'': \n\n<blockquote>\n\"of yeoman build and shaggy auburn beard, [and] did not quite look the part of a Scottish laird, until one spoke to him, and heard his rich, resonant voice and his short ejaculatory sentences. Of course, he had the voice and manner of an educated man of distinction.<br />\n<br />\n\"He was a leader, and above all things, a muscular type of Christian... As a player, in any position, [he] was an examplar of manly robust football. He popularised the game by his activity as a footballer among every class. He was at much at home with the boys of the Polytechnic, London, as he was with the [[Old Etonians F.C.|Old Etonians]].<br />\n<br />\n\"There was a time when the white ducks of Kinnaird, for he always wore trousers in a match, and his blue and white quartered cap were as familiar on the field as the giant figure of [[W.G. Grace]] with his yellow and red cricket cap... Lord Kinnaird used to say that he played four or five matches a week and never grew tired, but he added, late in life, that he would never have been allowed to stay on the field five minutes in these latter days. Nevertheless, he was fair, above board, and was prepared to receive all the knocks that came his way without a trace of resentment.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n===Administrator===\nAs an administrator, Kinnaird was an FA committeeman at the age of 21, in 1868. He became treasurer 9 years later and president 13 years after that, replacing [[Francis Marindin|Major Francis Marindin]] in 1890. He was to remain president for the next 33 years until his death in 1923, just months before the opening of [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].\n\nHe was an all-round sportsman, twice winning a blue at tennis, in 1868 and 1869, while at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and was first in an international canoe race at the 1867 Paris Exhibition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottishsporthistory.com/kinnaird-the-canoeist.html|title=Kinnaird the canoeist|website=Scottish Sport History \u2013 devoted to our sporting heritage}}</ref> He was [[Cambridge University]] swimming and [[fives]] champion, and won the [[Eton College]] 350 yards race in 1864.\n\n==Other interests==\nOutside of sport he was president of the [[YWCA]] and the [[YMCA]] in England,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Brown|first=Paul|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RcfKAQAAQBAJ&lpg=PA80&dq=11th%20lord%20arthur%20kinnaird%20%22ymca%22&pg=PA82#v=onepage|title=The Victorian Football Miscellany|date=2013-05-29|publisher=Superelastic|isbn=978-0-9562270-5-8|language=en}}</ref> a director of [[Barclays Bank]] and [[Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] in 1907, 1908 and 1909.

Kinnaird's mother was [[Mary Jane Kinnaird]] and he was born in London.

This bank later merged with others in 1896 to become [[Barclays Bank]] of which he was a main board director until his death.\n\nIn 1875, he married Mary Alma Victoria Agnew (1854\u20131923), the daughter of [[Sir Andrew Agnew, 8th Baronet]], and Lady Mary Noel, and had seven children,<ref>{{cite web|title=Arthur Fitzgerald Kinnaird, 11th Baron Kinnaird|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p8023.htm#i80226|publisher=ThePeerage.com}}</ref> including:\n\n* Douglas Arthur Kinnaird, who was born on 20 August 1879 and served during the [[First World War]] as a Captain in the 1st Battalion of the [[Scots Guards]]; he died on 24 October 1914 and is buried at [[Ypres]] in [[Belgium]].\n* Kenneth Fitzgerald Kinnaird (1880\u20131972), who inherited his father's titles; he married Frances Clifton (1876\u20131960) and was the father of Graham Charles Kinnaird (1912\u20131997), 13th Lord Kinnaird, upon whose death the titles became dormant.\n* Arthur Middleton Kinnaird, who was born on 20 April 1885 and served as a Lieutenant in the 1st Battalion of the Scots Guards; he died on  27 November 1917 and is buried at [[Ruyaulcourt]].\n* Patrick Kinnaird (1898\u20131948), who married, in 1912, Margaret Stella Wright (div.) and, in 1925, Violet Sandford.\n\n== Football career ==\n===Player===\nKinnaird first played football while at [[Cheam School]] and was captain of the school team in 1859, aged 12, for a match against [[Harrow School]]. He continued to play football at [[Eton College]], winning the House Cup in 1861 with Joynes's House, but was never selected for the school eleven. He first played association football early in 1866.\n\nAs a player, Kinnaird had a remarkable record in the [[FA Cup]]. He played in a record nine FA Cup finals. He was on the winning side three times with [[Wanderers F.C.|Wanderers]] and twice with the [[Old Etonians F.C.|Old Etonians]], and celebrated his fifth Cup Final victory by standing on his head in front of the pavilion. In the course of his career as a Cup Final player, Kinnaird played in every position, from goalkeeper to forward. It was while playing in goal for Wanderers in the [[1877 FA Cup Final|1877 final]] that he suffered the indignity of scoring the first significant [[own goal]] in football history, accidentally stepping backwards over his own goal line after fielding an innocuous long shot from an [[Oxford University A.F.C.|Oxford University]] forward.  The match finished 1\u20131 and Wanderers won with a second goal in extra time.  Some time after the match, for unknown reasons, the FA struck the Oxford goal from the records, changing the official score to 2\u20130 (although if Oxford had not scored, there would have been no reason for the game to go to extra time, so by rights they should have annulled Wanderers' second goal as well).<ref name=\"W47\">{{cite book |last= Warsop|first= Keith|title= The Early FA Cup Finals and the Southern Amateurs|year= 2004|publisher= SoccerData|isbn= 1-899468-78-1 |page=47}}</ref>  For the next century, all sources reported the score of the match as 2\u20130.<ref name=\"W47\" />  In the 1980s, after fresh research into contemporary reports of the game by football historians, the FA reinstated the Oxford goal, and now regard the official final score of the 1877 final as 2\u20131.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/CupFinalResults.aspx|archive-url=https://archive.is/20090616021730/http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/CupFinalResults.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 June 2009|title=Cup Final Statistics|publisher=The Football Association|accessdate=30 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nAlthough he was born in [[Kensington]], London, as a son of an old [[Perthshire]] family, Kinnaird also played for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]].<ref name = rsssf/> He made his solitary appearance against [[England national football team|England]] in the second ever international match, played on 8 March 1873 at [[The Oval]].<ref name = rsssf>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/scot-intres1880.html |title=Scotland \u2013 International Matches 1872\u20131880 |website= |publisher=RSSSF |date=19 September 2019 |accessdate=21 March 2020 |first1=Alan |last1=Brown |first2=Gabriele |last2=Tossani}}</ref>\n\n====Playing style====\n[[File:Arthur Fitzgerald Kinnaird.jpg|thumb|130px|Caricature of Kinnaird published in 1912]]\nHe was renowned as perhaps the toughest tackler of his day, giving rise to the (probably apocryphal) story that his wife once expressed the fear that he would \"come home one day with a broken leg.\" A friend is said to have responded: \"You must not worry, madam. If he does, it will not be his own.\" Posterity has awarded Arthur Kinnaird the reputation of being fond of '[[Hacking (rugby)|hacking]]', i.e. deliberately kicking his opponents. This is not entirely fair: reports from his playing days do not criticise him, and he owes his notoriety to an oft-repeated anecdote which first appeared in an October 1892 issue of ''Pastime'' magazine, a weekly sporting journal that was edited by [[Nicholas Lane Jackson|Nicholas Lane 'Pa' Jackson]], founder of the [[Corinthian_F.C.|Corinthian Football Club]] and a committee member of the Football Association.\n\nJackson wrote: 'The keen rivalry which at one time existed between the Old Etonians and Old Harrovians lent an additional zest to the matches between them, and in one of these Lord Kinnaird's energy was expended as much on the shins of his opponents as on the ball. This at length caused a protest from the captain of the Harrovians, who asked, 'Are we going to play the game, or are we going to have hacking?'  'Oh, let us have hacking!' was the noble reply.' Jackson later reveals that the opposing captain was [[C. W. Alcock|Charles Alcock]], which pinpoints the likely origin of the anecdote to a game on 16 November 1872, described as 'a friendly, but most vicious game of football' by The Graphic newspaper. Alcock and [[Morton Peto Betts]] were sufficiently disabled to be unable to play for England in the first official international, two weeks later.\n\nSportswriters and fellow internationals queued to pay tribute to Kinnaird's skill as a footballer both during and after his career. He was, according to \"Tityrus\" (J.A.H. Catton), editor of the ''Athletic News'': \n\n<blockquote>\n\"of yeoman build and shaggy auburn beard, [and] did not quite look the part of a Scottish laird, until one spoke to him, and heard his rich, resonant voice and his short ejaculatory sentences. Of course, he had the voice and manner of an educated man of distinction.<br />\n<br />\n\"He was a leader, and above all things, a muscular type of Christian... As a player, in any position, [he] was an examplar of manly robust football. He popularised the game by his activity as a footballer among every class. He was at much at home with the boys of the Polytechnic, London, as he was with the [[Old Etonians F.C.|Old Etonians]].<br />\n<br />\n\"There was a time when the white ducks of Kinnaird, for he always wore trousers in a match, and his blue and white quartered cap were as familiar on the field as the giant figure of [[W.G. Grace]] with his yellow and red cricket cap... Lord Kinnaird used to say that he played four or five matches a week and never grew tired, but he added, late in life, that he would never have been allowed to stay on the field five minutes in these latter days. Nevertheless, he was fair, above board, and was prepared to receive all the knocks that came his way without a trace of resentment.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n===Administrator===\nAs an administrator, Kinnaird was an FA committeeman at the age of 21, in 1868. He became treasurer 9 years later and president 13 years after that, replacing [[Francis Marindin|Major Francis Marindin]] in 1890. He was to remain president for the next 33 years until his death in 1923, just months before the opening of [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].\n\nHe was an all-round sportsman, twice winning a blue at tennis, in 1868 and 1869, while at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and was first in an international canoe race at the 1867 Paris Exhibition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottishsporthistory.com/kinnaird-the-canoeist.html|title=Kinnaird the canoeist|website=Scottish Sport History \u2013 devoted to our sporting heritage}}</ref> He was [[Cambridge University]] swimming and [[fives]] champion, and won the [[Eton College]] 350 yards race in 1864.\n\n==Other interests==\nOutside of sport he was president of the [[YWCA]] and the [[YMCA]] in England,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Brown|first=Paul|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RcfKAQAAQBAJ&lpg=PA80&dq=11th%20lord%20arthur%20kinnaird%20%22ymca%22&pg=PA82#v=onepage|title=The Victorian Football Miscellany|date=2013-05-29|publisher=Superelastic|isbn=978-0-9562270-5-8|language=en}}</ref> a director of [[Barclays Bank]] and [[Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] in 1907, 1908 and 1909.

{"title_page": "Khaled Hafez", "text_new": "{{nofootnotes|date=April 2020}}\n{{external links|date=April 2020}}\n'''Khaled Hafez''' (born Khaled Yehia Hafez Donia on 5 August 1963) is an Egyptian/French visual artist and educator. He is born in [[Cairo]], Egypt where he currently lives and works. He studied medicine and followed the evening classes of the Cairo School of Fine Arts (Faculty of Fine Arts) in the eighties. After attaining a medical degree in 1987 and M.Sc. as a medical specialist in 1992, he gave up medical practices in the early nineties for a career in the arts. He later obtained an MFA in [[new media]] and [[digital art]] from Transart Institutehttps://www.transartinstitute.org (New York, USA) and [[Danube University Krems]] (Austria). Hafez practice spans the mediums of painting, film / video, photography, installation and interdisciplinary approaches. Hafez is a [[Fulbright Fellow]] and Rockefeller Fellow.\n\n==Early life and early career itinerary==\n\nHafez was born in the Cairo suburb of [[Heliopolis, Cairo|Heliopolis]] to Yehia Hafez Donia and Wahiba Kamel, both physicians, which had an influence on his later education. His father served a long career in the [[Egyptian Armed Forces]] and retired as Brigadier after serving in five military Middle East conflicts, with special assignments in Syria, Yemen and Algeria in the late fifties and early sixties. His mother retired as a Professor of Internal Medicine, after in turn having served part of her career in the army, in special assignments in the sixties and seventies. The military background of his parents, especially that of his father\u2019s itinerary, is continuously referred to in Hafez\u2019s video works*, as well as in several large scale installations**.\n\nHafez went to primary and secondary education at [[St. Georges College, Cairo]], an Irish Catholic missionary school in Cairo, which enabled him to speak English and some French at an early age. Hafez studied medicine and followed the evening classes of the Cairo Fine Arts School (a.k.a. the Faculty of Fine Arts, Helwan University) in the early eighties. In those evening classes, Hafez studied painting with Egyptian painters Hamed Nada and later with Zakaria el Zeiny. After attaining a medical degree in 1987 and M.Sc. in dermatology & venereology in 1992, as well as two specialization diplomas ensued from Rene Descartes University [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Descartes_University] (AFSA) and Paris South University [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris-Sud_University] (DU) in Paris, France in 1994, he gave up medical practice for a career in the arts. In 2009 he obtained an MFA in new media and digital arts from Transart Institute (New York, USA) and Danube University Krems (Austria).\n\n== Work ==\n\nFor over three decades, Hafez core research focused on the exploration of the complex nature of identity; for his painting practice, the identity he scrutinizes is a one that is a composite of African, Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, Arab, Islamic, with ancient Egyptian and Judeo-Christian traces. In his video/film, photography and other interdisciplinary image-based works, Hafez explains \u201cI am interested in movement, an element that was indispensable in ancient Egyptian painting, where all painted elements were in motion, as opposed to Egyptian sculpture that always caught the protagonists in a \u201cpose\u201d, nearly always static. I use a lot of symbols and codes from a diversity of ancient cultures, and from the universal heritage of the world. In a contemporary culture dominated by a century of film and animation, the similarity between the ancient and the current contemporary forms of the kinetic is intriguing to me, and a focal aspect of my research. In my painting.\u201d\n\n== Painting ==\n\nHafez started as a figurative painter during the years when he studied at the evening classes at the Fine Arts school, with some inclination to neo-figuration, though a complete abstract painting practice marked his second and third solo exhibitions, entitled A Tale of Two Leos and Prisoner of Freedom (1989 and 1990 respectively).\n\nHafez moved to Paris in 1992, where he lived for three consecutive years; in Paris he became interested the larger than life photography used in street advertising and outdoor billboard signage, which to him was an urban landscape \u201cdifferent in structure and visuals\u201d from where he came from. After his return to Cairo in 1995, and his continuous mobility between Paris and Cairo for the two decades that followed, Hafez\u2019s painting practice saw a complete shift to neo-figuration [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-figurative_art] in 1996, where imagery was extracted from magazine advertising, manipulated and reassembled within mixed media painting, a style that developed into his personal style of painting in the following decades. \nHafez describes his use of figures from manipulated consumer goods advertising imagery and transforming those into ancient deities as \u201cattempt to break the barrier between East and West, between past and present, and between everything sacred and profane\u201d. In the projects ''Visions from a Rusty Memory''\u201d (1998) and ''Faster than the City'' (2000), both projects of medium sized to large mixed media canvases, he explored through visual irony and in juxtaposition notions of fiction and reality, legend, the hero as icon, space as a field where fiction and reality play, time and timelessness, memory as a universal recording device and a bank for codes and symbols, and color as an identifier. \nHafez says about this period \u201cDuring the early months of 1992, I had to lock up my studio in Cairo to start, a-never-to-be-forgotten relationship with Paris. Three years later, (and 9 group exhibitions), I had to prepare to lock up the mini studio where I worked for some time, a room in a shared apartment where I actually lived in one crowded Paris street. I had to dismantle canvases from stretchers, unframed works on paper, tailor carton boxes to take as many works as possible, and send all my work during three years on a boat to Alexandria with all my luggage and personal affairs. The works did not enjoy any advantage of the artwork treatment I enjoy today; protective packaging, art insurance, delicate handling, etc\u2026After having modestly boxed all my work, and after having sent everything, including my painting materials, I had to \u201clook for and do something else\u201d during the few weeks left till my departure to cairo. This \u201csomething else\u201d actually came out as a project of printed images and photomontages that perfectly describes an Egyptian living in Paris. Paris, as a pattern for occidental cosmopolitan cities, is --like other similar cities-- dominated by a genre of image culture; street and metro billboards, fully illustrated journals, colorful magazines, printed media saturated by pictures. A dweller in Paris does not need a text to understand a given message. Big numerous pictures deliver the message and short texts only elaborate. The image is the hero, the subject, the content and the latest news\u201d.\n\n==Installation==\n\nHafez\u2019s early installations (1989-1999) incorporated sculptural elements were linked to solo presentations; his first installation Cosmic Melody (1989) constituted an integral part to his painting solo presentation ''A Tale of Two Leos'' at Nile Gallery II (currently known as Palace of the Arts), Cairo, where an assemblage sculptural piece lay on one third of the space tying the four corners of the gallery ceiling in thick industrial maritime ropes; the viewers had to exert an effort to manage the footwork choreography and watch the large scale paintings. The ropes tying the room corresponded to geometrical lines within the painted surfaces.\n''Prisoner of Freedom'' (1990) \u2013an installation also linked to a painting project using the same title presented at the principal space of the Cairo Atelier, \u2013a none-for-profit space that exists in Cairo since the early thirties of the twentieth century\u2013 had a room partially ceiled from entry by ropes, separating the viewer from a real human skeleton, and few lines of graffiti written on the front wall. \n1n 1999 hafez installed a solo presentation with two stand-alone installations at the Guezira Art Center, one of the public spaces in Cairo, ''Halfway Home and The Electronic Gods'', none of them linked to any painting project. Both works explored juxtapositions of the sacred versus the consumable profane, and the validity of the linear perception of time in its relation to space. In 2006 Hafez started creating installations that would serve as stand-alone works as well as part of video installations; his reason for that as he says is that \u201cI always strive for witty solutions, and witty conversations; I come from a high context culture where a word may mean two or more things, a gest may mean one or three things, I find it witty and handy; so I create installations that can work alone or as part of another work, and even in my painting practice: diptychs can be linked and each side of the work can work alone\u201d.\n\nThis \u201cdiscipline\u201d \u2013as he addresses this part of the practice\u2013 entails a certain amount of design prior to execution. His first video installation work ''Revolution'', commissioned by the 1st Singapore Biennale, comprised a 4-minute 44 seconds video \u2013collected a year later by MuHKa, Antwerp, Belgium--, and a three-piece bronze sculptural installation entitled ''Contaminated Belief'' exhibited in museum-like glass cabinets \u2013both video and sculptural installation collected in 2010 by the Bamako Museum of Art, Mali. The video installation was critical of the three promises of the 1952 coup d\u2019etat that transformed Egypt from monarchy to a republic, namely social equality, liberty and unity. The split screen single channel video shows the same actor playing with a gun to represent subjugation, a cleaver (called \u201csatour\u201d in Arabic) to represent threat and terror and a hammer to represent neo economic slavery; each instrument represent a broken promise: the social equality of the gun, the pseudo liberty of the free transcontinental multinational economy, and the cleaver as a cut-throat tool of radical terrorism.\n\nMore recent installations include ''The Memory Box'', a versatile piece that can work as a stand-alone sculptural work as well as part of the 5-minute 55 seconds video installation ''On Noise, Sound & Silence: The Venice Water Composite'' (2013), conceived for the Maldives Pavilion of the 55th Venice Biennale. The work incorporate bronze casts of real objects that played a part in shaping the artist\u2019s growing memory as a child, like his father\u2019s camera when he served in military intelligence in Syria (1958-1960) and Yemen (1960-1964), and a bronze cast for his Rolex watch replica when he served in special assignment in Algeria (1966-1967). The video installation ''Mirror Sonata in Six Movements'', created for the 56th Venice Biennale official collateral event ''In the eye of the Thunderstorm'', curated by Martina Corgnati and commissioned by Omar Donia, was composed of a room, where the three front walls received animated synchronized screens that completed each other, while the viewer would stand in the middle surrounded by the simulated temple. The animation was based on one of Hafez older (2010) large-scale (750x200cm) canvases: ''Tomb Sonata in Three Military Movements'', where all elements on the painted surface were animated horizontally, as well as vertically to simulate perspective. The animation was created by co-worker artist Ahmed El Shaer and the music score was created by composer Mohamed Saleh of the then Cairo Symphony Orchestra, both regular contributors and coworkers in Hafez video works.\n\n==Performance==\n\nKhaled Hafez wrote and performed only one single performance in his career: ''Dwelling The Rest of History''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Khaled_Hafez-_MANIFESTA_8_performance_at_the_St._Antoin_Prison,_2010.jpg], which was part of an interdisciplinary project designed for and commissioned by Manifest 8 which took part in 2010 in Murcia and Cartagena, Spain. Hafez posed as an ex-prisoner offering a guided tour in the prison of San Anton, Cartagena. For 30 minutes, Hafez recounted fictitious stories of the prison and its prisoners, which were all scripted and had nothing to do with reality. At the end of the tour, Hafez explained that everything he said about the prison were not true, as all historical documents of this notorious institution have been purposefully destroyed in the eighties. For that performance, Hafez dressed in clich\u00e9-comic book striated shirt and barefoot, took the audience in a guided tour through the cells and corridors of the San Anton prison, recounting a scripted false history of the prison. Embedded within the true historical facts, there are fabricated stories that compensates for the total lack of historical documents in any archives.\n\n==Photography==\n\nOf all the media that Hafez uses to explore subject matter, his photography is almost always realistic and shows total refrain from conceptual approaches. With works shot in color, then transformed in black and white, cropped and presented in almost-always square format and printed on archival paper in small dimensions. Hafez explains \u201cmy first camera was a polaroid land camera 2000 offered to me by my father when I was 14, then upgraded to the 3000 model, also in plastic, one year later. I became addictive to the square format. I did not take photography any seriously except in the last two decades. I guess Paris and its outdoor photography-based advertising still influences me since the nineties. Photography is a brilliant medium: you can use it to document, freeze a moment in time, tell a story or just create a gorgeous composition for a function or another. Such sublime versatility of a medium is compelling. Indeed it has its specificity: it became too democratic, and anyone can create a photograph; this is excellent too. I am visually trained for photojournalism and street candid photography; this is what attracts me, and this is what engages me. Yes, for this noble medium, I refrain from conceptually approaching it, for fear of killing the joy of assimilating an accessible and comprehensible artwork by too much concept or loading the simple medium with fake messages that demolishes the straightforwardness of the image. A photographic image is perfect as it is, conceptualize it then you assassinate it.\u201d Hafez photography was exhibited in numerous solo and group exhibitions principally in Cairo, Egypt, though two of his photographic projects are part of the [[Ars Aevi]] Museum of Contemporary Art in Sarajevo, Bosnia Herzegovina, and the [[Vladikavkaz]] Museum of Art, North Osetia-Alania, Russia.\n\n==Video / Film==\n\n2015 - ''Mirrorr Sonata in Six Movements (for 12 hands)'', 90 seconds, video animation based on the painting \u201cTomb Sonata in Three Military Movements, 750x200cm, 2010.\nCreated for the 56th Venice Biennale official collateral exhibition ''In the Eye of the Thunderstorm'', Commissioner Omar Donia, Curator Martina Corgnati.\n\n2013 - ''On Noise, Sound & Silence: Sounds of the Kavkaz 2013'', 9 minutes, single channel digital, Comissioned by ALANICA 6 & Vladikavkaz Museum of Art, Russia.\n \t\t\n- ''On Noise, Sound & Silence: Water Composite 2013'', 5 minutes 55 seconds, three-channel digital video, 55th Venice Biennale, Italy, 2013.\n\n2011 - ''11.02-2011: the video diaries'', 5 minutes 55 seconds, 3-channel digital, Comissioned by the 8th Mercosur Biennale 2011, Single channel adaptation: 11th Havana Biennale 2012.\n\n- ''On Noise, Sound & Silence: Sounds of the Port 2011'', 2 minutes 58 seconds, single channel digital.\n\n \n2010 - ''Dwelling'', 11 minutes, single channel digital, Commissioned by Manifesta 8, curated by Chamber of Public Secrets. \n \n \n2009 - ''The A77A Project (On Presidents & Superheroes)'', 3minutes, 2D and 3D animation, video, sound score, single channel digital, Prizewinner Bamako Photobiennale 2012.\n \n \n2008 - The third Vision around 1:00 pm, 7 minutes, 4-channel digital, DV, stock images and stock footage, DV.\n \n \n2007 - ''Visions of a Contaminated Memory'', 5 minutes 45 seconds, 3-channel digital, DV, stock footage, DV, Comissioned by the Sharjah Biennale 2007.\n \t\n- ''Fruit Salad Mess with Collateral Surgical Precision'', 1 minute 30 seconds, single-channel digital, manipulated web images, original sound score,\n \n \n2006 - ''Revolution'', 4 minutes, split screen single-channel Hi-Def, Comissioned by the 1st Singapore Biennale 2006. \n \n \n2005 - ''The Red Crown'', 30 minutes, documentary, Egyptian Natioanl Film Center, Digital Beta.\n \t\n- ''Idlers\u2019 Clip'', 3 minutes, single-channel, Mini-DV.\n\n2003 - ''Idlers' Logic'', 24 minutes Experimental with three actors, Mini-DV, Prizewinner Dakar Biennae Dak\u2019Art 2004\n- ''Obsesive Compulsive Neurosis'', 4 minutes, single-channel, Mini-DV.\n\n \n2001 - ''Visions of a Cheeseburger Memory'', 11 min, Super VHS and Mini-DV, stock footage.\n\n==Books==\n\nHafez has to date two experimental published books combining drawing and prose in the Arabic language, and one academic book about image-based art practices authored in English, all three books published in 2010, though none of them was authored that year.

August 1963) is an Egyptian/French visual artist and educator. He is born in [[Cairo]], Egypt where he currently lives and works. He studied medicine and followed the evening classes of the Cairo School of Fine Arts (Faculty of Fine Arts) in the eighties. After attaining a medical degree in 1987 and M.Sc. as a medical specialist in 1992, he gave up medical practices in the early nineties for a career in the arts. He later obtained an MFA in [[new media]] and [[digital art]] from Transart Institutehttps://www.transartinstitute.org (New York, USA) and [[Danube University Krems]] (Austria). Hafez practice spans the mediums of painting, film / video, photography, installation and interdisciplinary approaches. Hafez is a [[Fulbright Fellow]] and Rockefeller Fellow.\n\n==Early life and early career itinerary==\n\nHafez was born in the Cairo suburb of [[Heliopolis, Cairo|Heliopolis]] to Yehia Hafez Donia and Wahiba Kamel, both physicians, which had an influence on his later education. His father served a long career in the [[Egyptian Armed Forces]] and retired as Brigadier after serving in five military Middle East conflicts, with special assignments in Syria, Yemen and Algeria in the late fifties and early sixties. His mother retired as a Professor of Internal Medicine, after in turn having served part of her career in the army, in special assignments in the sixties and seventies. The military background of his parents, especially that of his father\u2019s itinerary, is continuously referred to in Hafez\u2019s video works*, as well as in several large scale installations**.\n\nHafez went to primary and secondary education at [[St. Georges College, Cairo]], an Irish Catholic missionary school in Cairo, which enabled him to speak English and some French at an early age. Hafez studied medicine and followed the evening classes of the Cairo Fine Arts School (a.k.a. the Faculty of Fine Arts, Helwan University) in the early eighties. In those evening classes, Hafez studied painting with Egyptian painters Hamed Nada and later with Zakaria el Zeiny. After attaining a medical degree in 1987 and M.Sc. in dermatology & venereology in 1992, as well as two specialization diplomas ensued from Rene Descartes University [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Descartes_University] (AFSA) and Paris South University [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris-Sud_University] (DU) in Paris, France in 1994, he gave up medical practice for a career in the arts. In 2009 he obtained an MFA in new media and digital arts from Transart Institute (New York, USA) and Danube University Krems (Austria).\n\n== Work ==\n\nFor over three decades, Hafez core research focused on the exploration of the complex nature of identity; for his painting practice, the identity he scrutinizes is a one that is a composite of African, Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, Arab, Islamic, with ancient Egyptian and Judeo-Christian traces. In his video/film, photography and other interdisciplinary image-based works, Hafez explains \u201cI am interested in movement, an element that was indispensable in ancient Egyptian painting, where all painted elements were in motion, as opposed to Egyptian sculpture that always caught the protagonists in a \u201cpose\u201d, nearly always static. I use a lot of symbols and codes from a diversity of ancient cultures, and from the universal heritage of the world. In a contemporary culture dominated by a century of film and animation, the similarity between the ancient and the current contemporary forms of the kinetic is intriguing to me, and a focal aspect of my research. In my painting.\u201d\n\n== Painting ==\n\nHafez started as a figurative painter during the years when he studied at the evening classes at the Fine Arts school, with some inclination to neo-figuration, though a complete abstract painting practice marked his second and third solo exhibitions, entitled A Tale of Two Leos and Prisoner of Freedom (1989 and 1990 respectively).\n\nHafez moved to Paris in 1992, where he lived for three consecutive years; in Paris he became interested the larger than life photography used in street advertising and outdoor billboard signage, which to him was an urban landscape \u201cdifferent in structure and visuals\u201d from where he came from. After his return to Cairo in 1995, and his continuous mobility between Paris and Cairo for the two decades that followed, Hafez\u2019s painting practice saw a complete shift to neo-figuration [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-figurative_art] in 1996, where imagery was extracted from magazine advertising, manipulated and reassembled within mixed media painting, a style that developed into his personal style of painting in the following decades. \nHafez describes his use of figures from manipulated consumer goods advertising imagery and transforming those into ancient deities as \u201cattempt to break the barrier between East and West, between past and present, and between everything sacred and profane\u201d. In the projects ''Visions from a Rusty Memory''\u201d (1998) and ''Faster than the City'' (2000), both projects of medium sized to large mixed media canvases, he explored through visual irony and in juxtaposition notions of fiction and reality, legend, the hero as icon, space as a field where fiction and reality play, time and timelessness, memory as a universal recording device and a bank for codes and symbols, and color as an identifier. \nHafez says about this period \u201cDuring the early months of 1992, I had to lock up my studio in Cairo to start, a-never-to-be-forgotten relationship with Paris. Three years later, (and 9 group exhibitions), I had to prepare to lock up the mini studio where I worked for some time, a room in a shared apartment where I actually lived in one crowded Paris street. I had to dismantle canvases from stretchers, unframed works on paper, tailor carton boxes to take as many works as possible, and send all my work during three years on a boat to Alexandria with all my luggage and personal affairs. The works did not enjoy any advantage of the artwork treatment I enjoy today; protective packaging, art insurance, delicate handling, etc\u2026After having modestly boxed all my work, and after having sent everything, including my painting materials, I had to \u201clook for and do something else\u201d during the few weeks left till my departure to cairo. This \u201csomething else\u201d actually came out as a project of printed images and photomontages that perfectly describes an Egyptian living in Paris. Paris, as a pattern for occidental cosmopolitan cities, is --like other similar cities-- dominated by a genre of image culture; street and metro billboards, fully illustrated journals, colorful magazines, printed media saturated by pictures. A dweller in Paris does not need a text to understand a given message. Big numerous pictures deliver the message and short texts only elaborate. The image is the hero, the subject, the content and the latest news\u201d.\n\n==Installation==\n\nHafez\u2019s early installations (1989-1999) incorporated sculptural elements were linked to solo presentations; his first installation Cosmic Melody (1989) constituted an integral part to his painting solo presentation ''A Tale of Two Leos'' at Nile Gallery II (currently known as Palace of the Arts), Cairo, where an assemblage sculptural piece lay on one third of the space tying the four corners of the gallery ceiling in thick industrial maritime ropes; the viewers had to exert an effort to manage the footwork choreography and watch the large scale paintings. The ropes tying the room corresponded to geometrical lines within the painted surfaces.\n''Prisoner of Freedom'' (1990) \u2013an installation also linked to a painting project using the same title presented at the principal space of the Cairo Atelier, \u2013a none-for-profit space that exists in Cairo since the early thirties of the twentieth century\u2013 had a room partially ceiled from entry by ropes, separating the viewer from a real human skeleton, and few lines of graffiti written on the front wall. \n1n 1999 hafez installed a solo presentation with two stand-alone installations at the Guezira Art Center, one of the public spaces in Cairo, ''Halfway Home and The Electronic Gods'', none of them linked to any painting project. Both works explored juxtapositions of the sacred versus the consumable profane, and the validity of the linear perception of time in its relation to space. In 2006 Hafez started creating installations that would serve as stand-alone works as well as part of video installations; his reason for that as he says is that \u201cI always strive for witty solutions, and witty conversations; I come from a high context culture where a word may mean two or more things, a gest may mean one or three things, I find it witty and handy; so I create installations that can work alone or as part of another work, and even in my painting practice: diptychs can be linked and each side of the work can work alone\u201d.\n\nThis \u201cdiscipline\u201d \u2013as he addresses this part of the practice\u2013 entails a certain amount of design prior to execution. His first video installation work ''Revolution'', commissioned by the 1st Singapore Biennale, comprised a 4-minute 44 seconds video \u2013collected a year later by MuHKa, Antwerp, Belgium--, and a three-piece bronze sculptural installation entitled ''Contaminated Belief'' exhibited in museum-like glass cabinets \u2013both video and sculptural installation collected in 2010 by the Bamako Museum of Art, Mali. The video installation was critical of the three promises of the 1952 coup d\u2019etat that transformed Egypt from monarchy to a republic, namely social equality, liberty and unity. The split screen single channel video shows the same actor playing with a gun to represent subjugation, a cleaver (called \u201csatour\u201d in Arabic) to represent threat and terror and a hammer to represent neo economic slavery; each instrument represent a broken promise: the social equality of the gun, the pseudo liberty of the free transcontinental multinational economy, and the cleaver as a cut-throat tool of radical terrorism.\n\nMore recent installations include ''The Memory Box'', a versatile piece that can work as a stand-alone sculptural work as well as part of the 5-minute 55 seconds video installation ''On Noise, Sound & Silence: The Venice Water Composite'' (2013), conceived for the Maldives Pavilion of the 55th Venice Biennale. The work incorporate bronze casts of real objects that played a part in shaping the artist\u2019s growing memory as a child, like his father\u2019s camera when he served in military intelligence in Syria (1958-1960) and Yemen (1960-1964), and a bronze cast for his Rolex watch replica when he served in special assignment in Algeria (1966-1967). The video installation ''Mirror Sonata in Six Movements'', created for the 56th Venice Biennale official collateral event ''In the eye of the Thunderstorm'', curated by Martina Corgnati and commissioned by Omar Donia, was composed of a room, where the three front walls received animated synchronized screens that completed each other, while the viewer would stand in the middle surrounded by the simulated temple. The animation was based on one of Hafez older (2010) large-scale (750x200cm) canvases: ''Tomb Sonata in Three Military Movements'', where all elements on the painted surface were animated horizontally, as well as vertically to simulate perspective. The animation was created by co-worker artist Ahmed El Shaer and the music score was created by composer Mohamed Saleh of the then Cairo Symphony Orchestra, both regular contributors and coworkers in Hafez video works.\n\n==Performance==\n\nKhaled Hafez wrote and performed only one single performance in his career: ''Dwelling The Rest of History''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Khaled_Hafez-_MANIFESTA_8_performance_at_the_St._Antoin_Prison,_2010.jpg], which was part of an interdisciplinary project designed for and commissioned by Manifest 8 which took part in 2010 in Murcia and Cartagena, Spain. Hafez posed as an ex-prisoner offering a guided tour in the prison of San Anton, Cartagena. For 30 minutes, Hafez recounted fictitious stories of the prison and its prisoners, which were all scripted and had nothing to do with reality. At the end of the tour, Hafez explained that everything he said about the prison were not true, as all historical documents of this notorious institution have been purposefully destroyed in the eighties. For that performance, Hafez dressed in clich\u00e9-comic book striated shirt and barefoot, took the audience in a guided tour through the cells and corridors of the San Anton prison, recounting a scripted false history of the prison. Embedded within the true historical facts, there are fabricated stories that compensates for the total lack of historical documents in any archives.\n\n==Photography==\n\nOf all the media that Hafez uses to explore subject matter, his photography is almost always realistic and shows total refrain from conceptual approaches. With works shot in color, then transformed in black and white, cropped and presented in almost-always square format and printed on archival paper in small dimensions. Hafez explains \u201cmy first camera was a polaroid land camera 2000 offered to me by my father when I was 14, then upgraded to the 3000 model, also in plastic, one year later. I became addictive to the square format. I did not take photography any seriously except in the last two decades. I guess Paris and its outdoor photography-based advertising still influences me since the nineties. Photography is a brilliant medium: you can use it to document, freeze a moment in time, tell a story or just create a gorgeous composition for a function or another. Such sublime versatility of a medium is compelling. Indeed it has its specificity: it became too democratic, and anyone can create a photograph; this is excellent too. I am visually trained for photojournalism and street candid photography; this is what attracts me, and this is what engages me. Yes, for this noble medium, I refrain from conceptually approaching it, for fear of killing the joy of assimilating an accessible and comprehensible artwork by too much concept or loading the simple medium with fake messages that demolishes the straightforwardness of the image. A photographic image is perfect as it is, conceptualize it then you assassinate it.\u201d Hafez photography was exhibited in numerous solo and group exhibitions principally in Cairo, Egypt, though two of his photographic projects are part of the [[Ars Aevi]] Museum of Contemporary Art in Sarajevo, Bosnia Herzegovina, and the [[Vladikavkaz]] Museum of Art, North Osetia-Alania, Russia.\n\n==Video / Film==\n\n2015 - ''Mirrorr Sonata in Six Movements (for 12 hands)'', 90 seconds, video animation based on the painting \u201cTomb Sonata in Three Military Movements, 750x200cm, 2010.\nCreated for the 56th Venice Biennale official collateral exhibition ''In the Eye of the Thunderstorm'', Commissioner Omar Donia, Curator Martina Corgnati.\n\n2013 - ''On Noise, Sound & Silence: Sounds of the Kavkaz 2013'', 9 minutes, single channel digital, Comissioned by ALANICA 6 & Vladikavkaz Museum of Art, Russia.\n \t\t\n- ''On Noise, Sound & Silence: Water Composite 2013'', 5 minutes 55 seconds, three-channel digital video, 55th Venice Biennale, Italy, 2013.\n\n2011 - ''11.02-2011: the video diaries'', 5 minutes 55 seconds, 3-channel digital, Comissioned by the 8th Mercosur Biennale 2011, Single channel adaptation: 11th Havana Biennale 2012.\n\n- ''On Noise, Sound & Silence: Sounds of the Port 2011'', 2 minutes 58 seconds, single channel digital.\n\n \n2010 - ''Dwelling'', 11 minutes, single channel digital, Commissioned by Manifesta 8, curated by Chamber of Public Secrets. \n \n \n2009 - ''The A77A Project (On Presidents & Superheroes)'', 3minutes, 2D and 3D animation, video, sound score, single channel digital, Prizewinner Bamako Photobiennale 2012.\n \n \n2008 - The third Vision around 1:00 pm, 7 minutes, 4-channel digital, DV, stock images and stock footage, DV.\n \n \n2007 - ''Visions of a Contaminated Memory'', 5 minutes 45 seconds, 3-channel digital, DV, stock footage, DV, Comissioned by the Sharjah Biennale 2007.\n \t\n- ''Fruit Salad Mess with Collateral Surgical Precision'', 1 minute 30 seconds, single-channel digital, manipulated web images, original sound score,\n \n \n2006 - ''Revolution'', 4 minutes, split screen single-channel Hi-Def, Comissioned by the 1st Singapore Biennale 2006. \n \n \n2005 - ''The Red Crown'', 30 minutes, documentary, Egyptian Natioanl Film Center, Digital Beta.\n \t\n- ''Idlers\u2019 Clip'', 3 minutes, single-channel, Mini-DV.\n\n2003 - ''Idlers' Logic'', 24 minutes Experimental with three actors, Mini-DV, Prizewinner Dakar Biennae Dak\u2019Art 2004\n- ''Obsesive Compulsive Neurosis'', 4 minutes, single-channel, Mini-DV.\n\n \n2001 - ''Visions of a Cheeseburger Memory'', 11 min, Super VHS and Mini-DV, stock footage.\n\n==Books==\n\nHafez has to date two experimental published books combining drawing and prose in the Arabic language, and one academic book about image-based art practices authored in English, all three books published in 2010, though none of them was authored that year.
