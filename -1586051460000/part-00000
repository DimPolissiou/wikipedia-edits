It was first broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 31 March 2007. It sees the debut of [[Freema Agyeman]] as medical student [[Martha Jones]]. Agyeman had previously appeared as Martha's cousin Adeola in the 2006 episode \"[[Army of Ghosts]]\".\n\nThe episode sees alien police-for-hire called the [[Judoon]] transporting a London hospital to the [[Moon]] to hunt down a shapeshifting alien fugitive called \"[[List of Doctor Who villains#Florence Finnegan|Florence Finnegan]]\" ([[Anne Reid]]), who is posing as a human patient inside.\n\nThe episode was the first to feature Martha's family, her mother [[Francine Jones|Francine]] (played by [[Adjoa Andoh]]), father [[Clive Jones (Doctor Who)|Clive]] ([[Trevor Laird]]), sister [[Tish Jones|Tish]] ([[Gugu Mbatha-Raw]]), and brother [[Leo Jones (Doctor Who)|Leo]] ([[Reggie Yates]]).\n\nThe episode was shot mainly in August 2006, with [[Singleton Hospital]] and the [[University of Glamorgan]] doubling as the fictional Royal Hope Hospital. The Judoon wear prosthetics; for budget reasons only one Judoon is seen to take his helmet off.\n\nAccording to the [[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board|BARB]] figures this episode was seen by 8.7 million viewers and was the ninth most popular broadcast on British television in that week. It garnered an [[Appreciation Index]] of 88.<ref name=\"companion-smith\" />\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Judoon (6097818040).jpg|thumb|left|The Judoon, as they appear at the Doctor Who Experience]]\nA London hospital along with its staff and patients is transported to the Moon. Three spaceships land nearby, and the hospital is invaded by the [[Judoon]], an intergalactic police force for hire who are searching for a [[List of Doctor Who universe creatures and aliens (H\u2013P)#Plasmavore|Plasmavore]], an alien with the ability to appear as the species whose blood it consumes. The Judoon begin scanning everyone in the hospital, cataloguing the humans whilst attempting to find the non-human criminal. The [[Tenth Doctor]], posing as a human patient to investigate the hospital, talks to medical student [[Martha Jones]], revealing that he is an alien as well. The two go down to the lobby to find out what the Judoon are doing. An older lady named Florence Finnegan reveals that she is the Plasmavore. She drains Mr Stoker, the head of the hospital, and consequently registers as human when the Judoon scan her. The Doctor knows if he is scanned he will register as non-human, so he and Martha quietly avoid the Judoon, who will also likely execute all people within the hospital on grounds of harbouring a fugitive if they discover a non-human in the building. As the oxygen level in the hospital drops, people begin to collapse.\n\nThe Doctor finds Miss Finnegan in an [[MRI]] room, who is modifying the scanner to make it destroy all life on the Moon and the half of the Earth currently facing it. The Doctor pretends to be a confused human and Miss Finnegan drinks his blood until he collapses. Martha enters and grabs a Judoon scanner and exposes Finnegan as non-human. Confirming Finnegan is the fugitive they seek, the Judoon execute her for the murder of an alien princess and return for their ships. Martha uses [[CPR]] on the Doctor's two hearts to revive him. The Doctor disables the modified MRI and the Judoon finally shift the hospital back to Earth seconds before everyone perishes from oxygen deprivation.\n\nThat evening, after a birthday party for Martha's brother Leo ends in a fight, the Doctor invites Martha to go on a trip with him Martha hesitates until the Doctor says he can travel in time as well. Martha steps into the [[TARDIS]], and the Doctor tells her that she is only going on one trip with him.\n\n===Continuity===\nMorgenstern refers to a \"Saxon\" during his radio broadcast, claiming that the events of the episode prove Saxon's theories about alien life correct; in the preceding episode, \"[[The Runaway Bride (Doctor Who)|The Runaway Bride]]\", a Mr Saxon is said to have given the military the order to fire on the Empress's ship. A \"Vote Saxon\" poster, identical to one seen in the ''[[Torchwood]]'' episode \"[[Captain Jack Harkness (Torchwood episode)|Captain Jack Harkness]]\", and also in the trailer for the series, can be seen in the alleyway when the Doctor collects Martha. 'Mr Saxon' became the running theme for the third series, which came to its conclusion in the episodes \"[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]\", \"[[The Sound of Drums]]\" and \"[[Last of the Time Lords]]\".\n\nMartha refers to the spaceship crashing into [[Big Ben]] in \"[[Aliens of London]]\", the events of \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\" or \"[[The Runaway Bride (Doctor Who)|The Runaway Bride]]\", and the Battle of Canary Wharf against the Cybermen from \"[[Army of Ghosts]]\".<ref name=\"bs130\">Burk and Smith? p. 130</ref> She also recalls the loss of her cousin Adeola who \"worked at Canary Wharf\" and disappeared, a reference to the \"Army of Ghosts\" character played by the same actress.<ref name=\"bs130\"/><ref name=\"LizoInt\">{{cite interview | last = Davies | first = Russell T | subjectlink = Russell T Davies | interviewer = [[Lizo Mzimba]] | title = Exclusive Q&A: The brains behind Dr Who| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_5330000/newsid_5339400/5339430.stm | work = [[CBBC]] [[Newsround]] | date = 2006-09-12  | accessdate=4 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Doctor voices his approval of the hospital shop, a reference to \"[[New Earth (Doctor Who)|New Earth]]\", when he stated that he likes \"little shops\". The Doctor asks for a [[banana]] [[milk shake]]. He previously mentioned the fruit in \"[[The Doctor Dances]]\" and \"[[The Girl in the Fireplace]]\". The Doctor is able to focus [[X-ray|R\u00f6ntgen radiation]] into his left shoe, showing no real concern to his health. He is, however, susceptible to excessive radiation, the factor that caused the Tenth and [[Third Doctor|Third]] Doctors to [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]] in \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\" and ''[[Planet of the Spiders]]'' (1974) respectively. Martha asks the Doctor if he has a brother and he replies, \"Not any more\". A brother to the Doctor was previously mentioned in the [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] [[Virgin New Adventures|New Adventure]] novel ''[[Tears of the Oracle]]'' by [[Justin Richards]], which was edited by [[Simon Winstone]], [[script editor]] for this episode. The brother's name, or at least the name he used, was [[Irving Braxiatel]]. The Doctor uses his alias \"John Smith\", which was given to him by [[Jamie McCrimmon]] in the serial ''[[The Wheel in Space]]'' (1968).<ref name=\"4thdimension\">{{cite web|first=Peter|last=Ware|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006v193/features/smith-and-jones-the-fourth-dimension|title=The Fourth Dimension: Smith and Jones|publisher=BBC|accessdate=30 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Outside references===\nMartha refers to [[Zovirax]], a cold sore treatment. In the television advertisements for Zovirax a woman goes about her daily routine hiding her cold sores by wearing a motorbike helmet similar to those worn by the [[List of Doctor Who henchmen#Slab|Slabs]]. The Doctor says that he once had a laser spanner which was stolen by Emily Pankhurst, who he refers to as 'a cheeky woman'. [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] was one of the founders of the early 20th century British [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|Suffragette]] movement. The Doctor implies that he assisted [[Benjamin Franklin]] during his [[Kite experiment|1752 electricity experiment]] involving lightning, a kite and a key. 'Mrs Finnigan', the Plasmavore, is found drinking Mr Stoker's blood. Mr Stoker was intended by Russell T Davies to be a reference to the character Mr Stoker from the 1989 series ''[[Children's Ward]]'', on which he was a producer. However, the design department saw this as a reference to Bram Stoker, author of ''Dracula'', so the sign 'B. Stoker' was placed on the office door during production.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nThe \"Royal Hope Hospital\" name was reused in the [[Care (Law & Order: UK)|pilot episode]] of ''[[Law & Order: UK]]'', which starred [[Freema Agyeman]] and was written by ''Doctor Who'' and ''[[Torchwood]]'' writer [[Chris Chibnall]].\n\n==Production==\nThis is the first episode not to have a pre-credits sequence since the [[Ninth Doctor]] episode \"[[Rose (Doctor Who episode)|Rose]]\" (another series opener, also introducing a new companion). The next series opener, \"[[Partners in Crime (Doctor Who)|Partners in Crime]]\", would also have no pre-credits sequence.\n\n===Filming===\nFilming took place mainly in August 2006, with additional work done in September, October and November of that year. The hospital was filmed in several places over August - the School of Sciences at the [[University of Glamorgan]]<ref group=\"location\">School of Sciences (Hospital): {{Coord|51|35|38|N|3|19|18|W |name=University of Glamorgan, School of Sciences |type:landmark_region:GB-WLS}}</ref> was used, as well as parts of [[Singleton Hospital]] in [[Swansea]],<ref group=\"location\">Singleton Hospital (Hospital): {{Coord|51|36|34|N|3|59|7|W |name=Singleton Hospital |type:landmark_region:GB-WLS}}</ref> and Usk Valley Business Park.<ref group=\"location\">Usk Valley Business Park (Hospital):{{Coord|51|42|33|N|3|0|20|W |name=Usk Valley Business Park |type:landmark_region:GB-WLS}}</ref> The verandah and the staff kitchen were shot in the Doctor Who production team's studios at Upper Boat, [[Trefforest]].<ref name=\"companion-smith\" /><ref group=\"location\">Upper Boat Studios: {{Coord|51|34|32|N|3|18|2|W |name=Upper Boat Studios |type:landmark_region:GB-WLS}}</ref>\n\nThe alley at the end where the TARDIS was parked was filmed in [[Pontypridd]] in September 2006. The scenes featuring Martha's family were recorded in October 2006, also mainly in [[Pontypridd]].<ref name=\"companion-smith\" /><ref>\n{{Cite web\n|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/doctor-who-wales/alllocations/pontypridd-market-street\n|title= Walesarts, Market Street, Pontypridd\n|publisher = BBC\n|author =\n|date =\n|accessdate = 2010-05-30\n}}\n</ref> The street scenes with Tish at the start of the episode were filmed on Queen's Street in Cardiff in October.\n\nThe overall shape of the hospital was also modified to resemble the more square shape of [[St Thomas' Hospital]].  Early in the episode, a shot of the front of Singleton Hospital is seen where part of the building has been removed and an image of the [[London Eye]] added to make it appear that the hospital is in the location of St. Thomas'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/2340579.stm|title=Hospital workers postpone strike|publisher=BBC News|date=19 October 2002}}</ref>\n\nA shot in which the Doctor uses a door lock to lock a door was the final thing filmed for the episode, and does not depict David Tennant's own hand. Originally the scene had the Doctor use his Sonic Screwdriver to lock the door. It did not occur to anyone on the production staff that this contradicted a prior scene in which the Sonic Screwdriver is destroyed until post-production. The shot of him using the lock was hastily filmed and inserted.<ref>According to the [[List of Doctor Who home video releases#Tenth Doctor releases|''Doctor Who'': The Complete Third Series]]<nowiki/>commentary track of \"Smith and Jones\".</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe first use of Martha's theme in the music for the episode is sung by [[Melanie Pappenheim]].<ref>according to the ''[[Doctor Who Confidential]]'' episode \"Meet Martha Jones\"</ref> She previously featured in \"The Doctor's Theme\", \"Bad Wolf Theme\" and \"Doomsday\". The music at the start of the episode, when Martha is talking on the phone to her family, is \"Sunshine\" by [[Arrested Development (hip hop group)|Arrested Development]].\n\n===Cast notes===\n*[[Freema Agyeman]] previously played Adeola Oshodi in \"[[Army of Ghosts]]\" (2006).\n*[[Adjoa Andoh]] previously appeared as [[Sister Jatt]] in the Tenth Doctor episode \"[[New Earth (Doctor Who)|New Earth]]\" (2006).\n*[[Anne Reid]] previously appeared as Nurse Crane in the [[Seventh Doctor]] story ''[[The Curse of Fenric]]'' (1989).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/content/show-features/doctor-who/anne-reid-guest-stars/|title=Anne Reid guest-stars|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61hkrfUAR?url=http://old.radiotimes.com/content/show-features/doctor-who/anne-reid-guest-stars/|archivedate=15 September 2011|work=[[Radio Times]]|date=31 March 2007|accessdate=30 March 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n*[[Trevor Laird]] previously appeared as [[List of Doctor Who henchmen#Frax|Frax]] in the [[Sixth Doctor]] story ''[[Mindwarp]]'' (1986).\n*[[Roy Marsden]] previously appeared in the [[Eighth Doctor]] audio drama ''[[Human Resources (Doctor Who audio)|Human Resources]]''.\n\n==Broadcast and reception==\nIt was originally planned that the episode would air on 17 March 2007; however, the date was shifted back a week to 24 March, when it was realised that it would have gone up against the final of [[ITV1]] series ''[[Dancing on Ice]]''. The episode was then shifted back another week, to 31 March, because of England's [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Championship]] qualifier against Israel on 24 March.<ref name=\"companion-smith\">{{Cite journal|last=Pixley|first=Andrew|date=August 2007|title=Smith and Jones|journal=Doctor Who Magazine Special - Series 3 Companion|publisher=Panini Magazines}}</ref> \"Smith and Jones\" and \"[[The Shakespeare Code]]\" were previewed to the press on 21 March.

It was first broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 31 March 2007. It sees the debut of [[Freema Agyeman]] as medical student [[Martha Jones]]. Agyeman had previously appeared as Martha's cousin Adeola in the 2006 episode \"[[Army of Ghosts]]\".\n\nThe episode sees alien police-for-hire called the [[Judoon]] transporting a London hospital to the [[Moon]] to hunt down a shapeshifting alien fugitive called \"[[List of Doctor Who villains#Florence Finnegan|Florence Finnegan]]\" ([[Anne Reid]]), who is posing as a human patient inside.\n\nThe episode was the first to feature Martha's family, her mother [[Francine Jones|Francine]] (played by [[Adjoa Andoh]]), father [[Clive Jones (Doctor Who)|Clive]] ([[Trevor Laird]]), sister [[Tish Jones|Tish]] ([[Gugu Mbatha-Raw]]), and brother [[Leo Jones (Doctor Who)|Leo]] ([[Reggie Yates]]).\n\nThe episode was shot mainly in August 2006, with [[Singleton Hospital]] and the [[University of Glamorgan]] doubling as the fictional Royal Hope Hospital. The Judoon wear prosthetics; for budget reasons only one Judoon is seen to take his helmet off.\n\nAccording to the [[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board|BARB]] figures this episode was seen by 8.7 million viewers and was the ninth most popular broadcast on British television in that week. It garnered an [[Appreciation Index]] of 88.<ref name=\"companion-smith\" />\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Judoon (6097818040).jpg|thumb|left|The Judoon, as they appear at the Doctor Who Experience]]\nA London hospital along with its staff and patients is transported to the Moon. Three spaceships land nearby, and the hospital is invaded by the [[Judoon]], an intergalactic police force for hire who are searching for a [[List of Doctor Who universe creatures and aliens (H\u2013P)#Plasmavore|Plasmavore]], an alien with the ability to appear as the species whose blood it consumes. The Judoon begin scanning everyone in the hospital, cataloguing the humans whilst attempting to find the non-human criminal. The [[Tenth Doctor]], posing as a human patient to investigate the hospital, talks to medical student [[Martha Jones]], revealing that he is an alien as well. The two go down to the lobby to find out what the Judoon are doing. An older lady named Florence Finnegan reveals that she is the Plasmavore. She drains Mr Stoker, the head of the hospital, and consequently registers as human when the Judoon scan her. The Doctor knows if he is scanned he will register as non-human, so he and Martha quietly avoid the Judoon, who will also likely execute all people within the hospital on grounds of harbouring a fugitive if they discover a non-human in the building. As the oxygen level in the hospital drops, people begin to collapse.\n\nThe Doctor finds Miss Finnegan in an [[MRI]] room, who is modifying the scanner to make it destroy all life on the Moon and the half of the Earth currently facing it. The Doctor pretends to be a confused human and Miss Finnegan drinks his blood until he collapses. Martha enters and grabs a Judoon scanner and exposes Finnegan as non-human. Confirming Finnegan is the fugitive they seek, the Judoon execute her for the murder of an alien princess and return for their ships. Martha uses [[CPR]] on the Doctor's two hearts to revive him. The Doctor disables the modified MRI and the Judoon finally shift the hospital back to Earth seconds before everyone perishes from oxygen deprivation.\n\nThat evening, after a birthday party for Martha's brother Leo ends in a fight, the Doctor invites Martha to go on a trip with him Martha hesitates until the Doctor says he can travel in time as well. Martha steps into the [[TARDIS]], and the Doctor tells her that she is only going on one trip with him.\n\n===Continuity===\nMorgenstern refers to a \"Saxon\" during his radio broadcast, claiming that the events of the episode prove Saxon's theories about alien life correct; in the preceding episode, \"[[The Runaway Bride (Doctor Who)|The Runaway Bride]]\", a Mr Saxon is said to have given the military the order to fire on the Empress's ship. A \"Vote Saxon\" poster, identical to one seen in the ''[[Torchwood]]'' episode \"[[Captain Jack Harkness (Torchwood episode)|Captain Jack Harkness]]\", and also in the trailer for the series, can be seen in the alleyway when the Doctor collects Martha. 'Mr Saxon' became the running theme for the third series, which came to its conclusion in the episodes \"[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]\", \"[[The Sound of Drums]]\" and \"[[Last of the Time Lords]]\".\n\nMartha refers to the spaceship crashing into [[Big Ben]] in \"[[Aliens of London]]\", the events of \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\" or \"[[The Runaway Bride (Doctor Who)|The Runaway Bride]]\", and the Battle of Canary Wharf against the Cybermen from \"[[Army of Ghosts]]\".<ref name=\"bs130\">Burk and Smith? p. 130</ref> She also recalls the loss of her cousin Adeola who \"worked at Canary Wharf\" and disappeared, a reference to the \"Army of Ghosts\" character played by the same actress.<ref name=\"bs130\"/><ref name=\"LizoInt\">{{cite interview | last = Davies | first = Russell T | subjectlink = Russell T Davies | interviewer = [[Lizo Mzimba]] | title = Exclusive Q&A: The brains behind Dr Who| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_5330000/newsid_5339400/5339430.stm | work = [[CBBC]] [[Newsround]] | date = 2006-09-12  | accessdate=4 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Doctor voices his approval of the hospital shop, a reference to \"[[New Earth (Doctor Who)|New Earth]]\", when he stated that he likes \"little shops\". The Doctor asks for a [[banana]] [[milk shake]]. He previously mentioned the fruit in \"[[The Doctor Dances]]\" and \"[[The Girl in the Fireplace]]\". The Doctor is able to focus [[X-ray|R\u00f6ntgen radiation]] into his left shoe, showing no real concern to his health. He is, however, susceptible to excessive radiation, the factor that caused the Tenth and [[Third Doctor|Third]] Doctors to [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]] in \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\" and ''[[Planet of the Spiders]]'' (1974) respectively. Martha asks the Doctor if he has a brother and he replies, \"Not any more\". A brother to the Doctor was previously mentioned in the [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] [[Virgin New Adventures|New Adventure]] novel ''[[Tears of the Oracle]]'' by [[Justin Richards]], which was edited by [[Simon Winstone]], [[script editor]] for this episode. The brother's name, or at least the name he used, was [[Irving Braxiatel]]. The Doctor uses his alias \"John Smith\", which was given to him by [[Jamie McCrimmon]] in the serial ''[[The Wheel in Space]]'' (1968).<ref name=\"4thdimension\">{{cite web|first=Peter|last=Ware|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006v193/features/smith-and-jones-the-fourth-dimension|title=The Fourth Dimension: Smith and Jones|publisher=BBC|accessdate=30 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Outside references===\nMartha refers to [[Zovirax]], a cold sore treatment. In the television advertisements for Zovirax a woman goes about her daily routine hiding her cold sores by wearing a motorbike helmet similar to those worn by the [[List of Doctor Who henchmen#Slab|Slabs]]. The Doctor says that he once had a laser spanner which was stolen by Emily Pankhurst, who he refers to as 'a cheeky woman'. [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] was one of the founders of the early 20th century British [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|Suffragette]] movement. The Doctor implies that he assisted [[Benjamin Franklin]] during his [[Kite experiment|1752 electricity experiment]] involving lightning, a kite and a key. 'Mrs Finnigan', the Plasmavore, is found drinking Mr Stoker's blood. Mr Stoker was intended by Russell T Davies to be a reference to the character Mr Stoker from the 1989 series ''[[Children's Ward]]'', on which he was a producer. However, the design department saw this as a reference to Bram Stoker, author of ''Dracula'', so the sign 'B. Stoker' was placed on the office door during production.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nThe \"Royal Hope Hospital\" name was reused in the [[Care (Law & Order: UK)|pilot episode]] of ''[[Law & Order: UK]]'', which starred [[Freema Agyeman]] and was written by ''Doctor Who'' and ''[[Torchwood]]'' writer [[Chris Chibnall]].\n\n==Production==\nThis is the first episode not to have a pre-credits sequence since the [[Ninth Doctor]] episode \"[[Rose (Doctor Who episode)|Rose]]\" (another series opener, also introducing a new companion). The next series opener, \"[[Partners in Crime (Doctor Who)|Partners in Crime]]\", would also have no pre-credits sequence.\n\n===Filming===\nFilming took place mainly in August 2006, with additional work done in September, October and November of that year. The hospital was filmed in several places over August - the School of Sciences at the [[University of Glamorgan]]<ref group=\"location\">School of Sciences (Hospital): {{Coord|51|35|38|N|3|19|18|W |name=University of Glamorgan, School of Sciences |type:landmark_region:GB-WLS}}</ref> was used, as well as parts of [[Singleton Hospital]] in [[Swansea]],<ref group=\"location\">Singelton Hospital (Hospital): {{Coord|51|36|34|N|3|59|7|W |name=Singleton Hospital |type:landmark_region:GB-WLS}}</ref> and Usk Valley Business Park.<ref group=\"location\">Usk Valley Business Park (Hospital):{{Coord|51|42|33|N|3|0|20|W |name=Usk Valley Business Park |type:landmark_region:GB-WLS}}</ref> The verandah and the staff kitchen were shot in the Doctor Who production team's studios at Upper Boat, [[Trefforest]].<ref name=\"companion-smith\" /><ref group=\"location\">Upper Boat Studios: {{Coord|51|34|32|N|3|18|2|W |name=Upper Boat Studios |type:landmark_region:GB-WLS}}</ref>\n\nThe alley at the end where the TARDIS was parked was filmed in [[Pontypridd]] in September 2006. The scenes featuring Martha's family were recorded in October 2006, also mainly in [[Pontypridd]].<ref name=\"companion-smith\" /><ref>\n{{Cite web\n|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/doctor-who-wales/alllocations/pontypridd-market-street\n|title= Walesarts, Market Street, Pontypridd\n|publisher = BBC\n|author =\n|date =\n|accessdate = 2010-05-30\n}}\n</ref> The street scenes with Tish at the start of the episode were filmed on Queen's Street in Cardiff in October.\n\nThe overall shape of the hospital was also modified to resemble the more square shape of [[St Thomas' Hospital]].  Early in the episode, a shot of the front of Singleton Hospital is seen where part of the building has been removed and an image of the [[London Eye]] added to make it appear that the hospital is in the location of St. Thomas'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/2340579.stm|title=Hospital workers postpone strike|publisher=BBC News|date=19 October 2002}}</ref>\n\nA shot in which the Doctor uses a door lock to lock a door was the final thing filmed for the episode, and does not depict David Tennant's own hand. Originally the scene had the Doctor use his Sonic Screwdriver to lock the door. It did not occur to anyone on the production staff that this contradicted a prior scene in which the Sonic Screwdriver is destroyed until post-production. The shot of him using the lock was hastily filmed and inserted.<ref>According to the [[List of Doctor Who home video releases#Tenth Doctor releases|''Doctor Who'': The Complete Third Series]]<nowiki/>commentary track of \"Smith and Jones\".</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe first use of Martha's theme in the music for the episode is sung by [[Melanie Pappenheim]].<ref>according to the ''[[Doctor Who Confidential]]'' episode \"Meet Martha Jones\"</ref> She previously featured in \"The Doctor's Theme\", \"Bad Wolf Theme\" and \"Doomsday\". The music at the start of the episode, when Martha is talking on the phone to her family, is \"Sunshine\" by [[Arrested Development (hip hop group)|Arrested Development]].\n\n===Cast notes===\n*[[Freema Agyeman]] previously played Adeola Oshodi in \"[[Army of Ghosts]]\" (2006).\n*[[Adjoa Andoh]] previously appeared as [[Sister Jatt]] in the Tenth Doctor episode \"[[New Earth (Doctor Who)|New Earth]]\" (2006).\n*[[Anne Reid]] previously appeared as Nurse Crane in the [[Seventh Doctor]] story ''[[The Curse of Fenric]]'' (1989).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/content/show-features/doctor-who/anne-reid-guest-stars/|title=Anne Reid guest-stars|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61hkrfUAR?url=http://old.radiotimes.com/content/show-features/doctor-who/anne-reid-guest-stars/|archivedate=15 September 2011|work=[[Radio Times]]|date=31 March 2007|accessdate=30 March 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n*[[Trevor Laird]] previously appeared as [[List of Doctor Who henchmen#Frax|Frax]] in the [[Sixth Doctor]] story ''[[Mindwarp]]'' (1986).\n*[[Roy Marsden]] previously appeared in the [[Eighth Doctor]] audio drama ''[[Human Resources (Doctor Who audio)|Human Resources]]''.\n\n==Broadcast and reception==\nIt was originally planned that the episode would air on 17 March 2007; however, the date was shifted back a week to 24 March, when it was realised that it would have gone up against the final of [[ITV1]] series ''[[Dancing on Ice]]''.

Her father's name was Graumann; her aunt was the pianist and friend of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Dorothea von Ertmann]], n\u00e9e Graumann. In her adolescence her family fortunes failed, so she travelled at the age of 22 to Vienna to study voice. Thereafter she went to Paris and studied with [[Manuel Garc\u00eda (baritone)|Manuel Garc\u00eda II]], who was to have the foremost influence on her. She made her debut as a singer in 1844, and had a short career in [[opera]] and recital. Her voice, however, was only adequate, so she moved to teaching in 1849. In 1852, she married Italian baritone Salvatore Marchesi, Cavaliere de Castrone (d. 1908).\n\nIt was in this field that she would become famous. She taught at the conservatory in Cologne and, in the 1870s at the [[University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna|Vienna Conservatory]], where she tutored [[Marie Fillunger]] among others.<ref name=\"Full\">{{cite book |title=Manchester Faces and Places |date=February 1905 |publisher=Geo.

Ultimately, she was best known as the vocal teacher of a number of great singers. The most famous among them is perhaps [[Nellie Melba]], but she also trained such illustrious singers as [[Emma Calv\u00e9]], [[Frances Alda]], [[Ellen Gulbranson]], [[Selma Kurz]] and [[Emma Eames]]. Marchesi died in London in 1913. The mother of [[Joan Sutherland]] was taught by a pupil of Marchesi.\n\nToday, Marchesi is remembered not at all for her singing career. Rather, she is known first and foremost as the teacher of a surprising number of great singers, and also as the person who carried the bel canto technique into the 20th century. Her ideas are still studied, primarily by female singers, especially those with voices in the [[soprano]] range, in which Marchesi had specialized.\n\n==Teachings==\n\nMarchesi was clearly committed to the bel canto style of singing. Despite this, she did not particularly identify herself as a bel canto teacher. She asserted that there were only two styles of singing: \"the ''good''...and the ''bad''\" and argued that a properly trained vocalist could sing the old bel canto style just as easily as the then newer, more dramatic style.\n\nShe was generally an advocate of a naturalistic style of singing:  she called for a fairly instinctive method of breathing and argued against the \"smiling\" mouth position that many teachers of her day preferred. She was particularly concerned with [[vocal registration]], calling it \"the Alpha and Omega of the formation and development of the female voice, the touchstone of all singing methods, old and new.\" She also repeatedly expressed disdain for the teachers of her day who offered methods that they asserted would fully develop the voice in only a year or two. Instead, she felt that vocal training was best approached at a slow and deliberate pace.\n\nTwo of the most distinctive features of her teachings were her \"analytical method\" and her insistence on very short practice times for beginners. Her \"analytical method\" placed great importance on intellectually understanding both the technical and the aesthetic nature of everything sung, from grand arias to simple vocal exercises. She argued that rote practice without understanding was ultimately harmful to the artistic use of the voice. Most distinctively, though, she insisted on very short practice times for beginners, as little as five minutes at a stretch three or four times a day for absolute beginners. Of course, as the voice matured those times could and should be expanded.\n\n==Pupils==\nAmong her pupils were:\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Suzanne Adams]]\n* [[Frances Alda]]\n* [[Sigrid Arnoldson]]\n* [[Blanche Arral]]\n* Kate Bensberg\n* Nadina Bulcioff\n* [[Emma Calv\u00e9]]\n* [[Ada Crossley]]\n* [[Ema Puk\u0161ec|Ilma de Murska]]\n* [[May De Sousa]]\n* Marie Duma\n* [[Emma Eames]]\n* Rose Ettinger\n* Antonietta Fricci\n* [[Marie Fillunger]]<ref name=\"Full\"/>\n* [[Mary Garden]]\n* [[Etelka Gerster]]\n* [[Louise Johnson-Missievitch]]\n* [[Jeanne Jomelli]]\n* [[Bo\u017eena Kacerovsk\u00e1]]\n* [[Mai Kalna]]\n* [[Katharina Klafsky]]\n* [[Gabrielle Krauss]]\n* [[Selma Kurz]]\n* [[Miriam Licette]]\n* [[Estelle Liebling]]\n* Blanche Marchesi (her daughter)\n* Dame [[Nellie Melba]]\n* [[Yevgeniya Mravina]]\n* Louise Natali-Graham\n* [[Emma Nevada]]\n* [[Aglaja Orgeni]]\n* [[Gina Oselio]]\n* [[Regina Pacini]]\n* [[Rosa Papier]]\n* [[Anna Pessiak-Schmerling]]\n* Marta Petrini\n* Sedohr Rhodes\n* Louise Rieger\n* Caroline Salla\n* [[Sibyl Sanderson]]\n* Frances Saville\n* [[Evelyn Scotney]]\n* Nadina Slaviansky\n* [[Georgina Stirling]]\n* Maggie Stirling\n* Florence Toronta\n* Guillaume Tremelli\n* Inez McCune Williamson\n* [[Ellen Beach Yaw]]\n* [[Nadezhda Zabela-Vrubel]]\n{{div col end}}\n(Some pupils were noted on an 1899 dedicatory poster, ''Anniversary Fete \u2013 fifty years professorship, Mathilde Marchesi, 1849\u20131899'').\n\n==Family==\nHer daughter, [[Blanche Marchesi]] (1863\u20131940), a [[contralto]], also a noted singer and teacher, made her d\u00e9but at a young age.

Her father's name was Graumann; her aunt was the pianist and friend of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Dorothea von Ertmann]], n\u00e9e Graumann. In her adolescence her family fortunes failed, so she travelled at the age of 22 to Vienna to study voice.
