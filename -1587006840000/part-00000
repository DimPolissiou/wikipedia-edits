{"title_page": "Don Garlits", "text_new": "[[Image:DonGarlitsApril1987.jpg|thumb|right|Garlits in 1987]]\n\n'''Donald Glenn \"Don\" Garlits''' (born January 14, 1932, [[Tampa, Florida]] ) is an American race car driver and automotive engineer. He is considered the father of [[drag racing]]. He is [[List of motorsports people by nickname#B|known as]] \"Big Daddy\" to drag racing fans around the world. Always a pioneer in the field of drag racing, he perfected the rear-engine [[Top Fuel]] [[Dragster (car)|dragster]], an innovation motivated by the loss of part of his foot in a dragster accident. This design was notably safer since it put most of the fuel processing and rotating parts of the dragster behind the driver. The driver was placed in front of nearly all the mechanical components, thus protecting the driver and allowing him to activate a variety of safety equipment in the event of catastrophic mechanical failure or a fire. Garlits was an early promoter of the full-body, fire-resistant [[Nomex]] driving suit, complete with socks, gloves, and [[Balaclava (clothing)|balaclava]].\n\nGarlits was the first drag racer to officially surpass the 170, 180, 200,{{citation needed|date=November 2018|reason=this is debated}} 240, 250, and 270 mile per hour marks in the quarter mile; he was also the first to top {{convert|200|mph|abbr=on}} in the {{convert|1/8|mi|abbr=on}}. He has been inducted into several Halls of Fame and has won many awards during his career.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early days===\nAfter [[World War II]], in the central and western United States, many air force bases and landing fields were decommissioned. These abandoned runways were perfect for drag racing.

He used an arc welder and a cutting torch to modify an old 1927 [[Ford Model T]] Roadster. To this roadster he added a 1948 Mercury engine block, a 1939 Ford floor shift transmission, and a 1948 Ford differential and axle. That early T-Bucket's quarter mile performance was 13.5 seconds, at a top speed of 93&nbsp;mph. It was this successful, formative roadster that would become the basis for his first rail-job dragster. He cut off the body panels, moved the engine back, and installed the seat behind the drive axle. (A similar design was built that same year by [[Mickey Thompson]].) This was the legendary slingshot dragster with which Big Daddy would win the first [[NHRA]] race he entered, the NHRA Safety Safari in [[Lake City, Florida]]. (12.1 seconds, 108&nbsp;mph.) Three years later, he became a professional drag racer. The first national drag racing meet, sponsored by the [[National Hot Rod Association]] was held on an airfield near [[Great Bend, KS]] in 1955. Don Garlits, being from Florida, was something of an outsider. He was sometimes referred to as the Floridian, before permanently adopting the nickname \"Swamp Rat,\" which also became the name for each new generation of his innovative dragster designs.\n\nIn 1959, Garlits traveled to [[Bakersfield, California]] for the US Fuel and Gas Championships, later to be named the \"[[March Meet]]\", to show that the times he was setting were as legitimate as those set by the west coast racers. Over 30,000 people attended the event, the largest attendance at a drag race at that point. His presence helped to grow the sport of [[drag racing]] beyond its California base. In 1964, after winning the U.S. Nationals at Indianapolis, Garlits traveled to England, with TV [[Tommy Ivo]], Tony Nancy, Dante Duce and other racers, to participate in the first International Drag Festival, a six-event series that did much to promote the sport of drag racing in the UK.\n\n===Accident leads to innovation===\nOn March 8, 1970, at [[Lions Drag Strip]],<ref name=\"auto\">[http://www.nhra.com/news/2015/front-back-rear-engine-transition NHRA.com] (retrieved 24 May 2017</ref> Garlits was driving ''Swamp Rat XIII'', also called the ''Wynnscharger'', a [[Front engine dragster|slingshot]] rail, when the vehicle suffered a catastrophic failure.

He announced for four seasons, from 1988 through the end of 1991. In December 1991 Garlits came out of retirement to race in the Snowbird Nationals, but his comeback was to be short lived. \"Big Daddy\" retired again before the end of the 1992 season due to a separated [[retina]], a product of the 4g deceleration produced by a Top Fuel Dragster's braking parachutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhra.com/50th/news/index.html?story=227|title= Detached retina forces Garlits to retire|date=1992-06-05|work=National Dragster|accessdate=2008-09-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051105224252/http://www.nhra.com/50th/news/index.html?story=227 |archivedate = November 5, 2005}}</ref> \n\nGarlits resumed his career briefly in 1998, and again in 2003. His last qualifying race was in May 2003 at the NHRA POWERade Drag Racing Series, 23rd annual [[Summit Racing Equipment]] NHRA Southern Nationals presented by Pontiac in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. At the age of 71 years, 5 months and 19 days he qualified 16th, setting a personal best speed in the quarter mile with a time of 4.788 seconds at 319.98&nbsp;mph. Garlits had reached 323.04 earlier in the year at the 2003 Gatornationals. Mr. Garlits lost in first round competition with his Summit Racing-Mono Winged Dragster, clocking in with a 0.064 reaction time, a personal best 4.737 elapsed time, and 307.44&nbsp;mph, second only to Brandon Bernstein's (son of racing legend Kenny Bernstein,) Budweiser/Lucas Oil Dragster 0.079 reaction time, a 4.615 elapsed time, at 321.42 miles per hour. The difference at the finish line was only 122 thousandths of a second.\n\nGarlits operates the [[Don Garlits Museum of Drag Racing]] on the grounds of his home in [[Ocala, Florida]]. He can also be seen from time to time on ESPN and Speed Vision doing commentary at racing events and performance expositions.\n\nAlways at the forefront of driver safety, in the wake of Funny Car driver [[Scott Kalitta]]'s fatal crash and numerous other engine explosions and resultant fires, occurring in the last 300 feet of the quarter mile, Garlits declared \"I am 100-percent in favor of it\", regarding NHRA's proposal to trim the race distance for Top Fuel and Funny Car from the traditional quarter-mile to 1,000 feet, also suggesting that he would support a ban on rev limiters and a return to a 70/30 [[nitromethane]] to [[methanol]] ratio.<ref>[http://moparmuscle.automotive.com/80081/mopp-0807-big-daddy-don-garlits-opinion-on-1000-foot-nhra-race-distance/index.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707191403/http://moparmuscle.automotive.com/80081/mopp-0807-big-daddy-don-garlits-opinion-on-1000-foot-nhra-race-distance/index.html |date=July 7, 2011 }}</ref> He has since had second thoughts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.garlits.com/newshome.htm |title=Don Garlits Museum Ocala, FL - Schedule News & Events |work=Garlits.com |date=2009-11-27 |accessdate=2010-01-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116181128/http://www.garlits.com/newshome.htm |archivedate=2010-01-16 }}</ref>\n\nIn September 2009, Garlits returned to the quarter mile, racing a specially prepared 2009 Dodge Challenger in the [[Stock (drag racing class)|Stock]] class at the [[2009 NHRA U.S. Nationals|U.S. Nationals]] at the [[Indianapolis Raceway Park]].{{clarify|date=November 2018|reason=did he take Stock Eliminator, or just make the final?}}\n\nIn May 2014 at age 82, Garlits set a {{convert|184|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} speed record with Swamp Rat 37, a 2,000 hp battery-powered [[EV dragster]] .<ref>[https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a15360066/at-82-years-old-don-garlits-sets-184-mph-ev-dragster-record-guns-for-200-mph-next/ At 82 Years Old, Don Garlits Sets 184-mph EV Dragster Record, Guns for 200 mph Next] - Davey G.

Barry [[tropical cyclogenesis|originated]] as a [[mesoscale convective vortex]] over the [[midwestern United States]] on July&nbsp;2. The system eventually emerged into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] on July&nbsp;10, whereupon the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) designated it as a potential tropical cyclone later. Early on July&nbsp;11, the system developed into a tropical depression and later tropical Storm Barry, the second [[tropical cyclone naming|named storm]] of the [[2019 Atlantic hurricane season|annual hurricane season]]. On July&nbsp;13, Barry attained maximum 1-minute sustained winds of 75&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h), with a minimum central pressure of {{convert|993|mbar|inHg}}, becoming the first hurricane of the season. Later that day, Barry made landfall on [[Marsh Island (Louisiana)|Marsh Island]] and [[Intracoastal City, Louisiana|Intracoastal City]], [[Louisiana]] both times as a Category&nbsp;1 hurricane, subsequently weakening to tropical storm status. Late on July 15, Barry degenerated into a remnant low over northern [[Arkansas]], before dissipating on July 19.\n\nBarry was one of four hurricanes to hit Louisiana at that [[maximum sustained winds|intensity]] in the month of July, the others being [[Hurricane Bob (1979)|Bob]] in [[1979 Atlantic hurricane season|1979]], [[Hurricane Danny (1997)|Danny]] in [[1997 Atlantic hurricane season|1997]], and [[Hurricane Cindy (2005)|Cindy]] in [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005]].<ref name=\"fourth hurricane landfall\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/live-barry-strengthens-into-category-1-hurricane-gulf-coast-braces-for-impact/70008799|title=First hurricane landfall of the season leaves Louisiana, Mississippi waterlogged|last1=Mitchell|first1=Chaffin|last2=Navarro|first2=Adriana|publisher=Accuweather|website=www.accuweather.com|date=July 14, 2019|access-date=July 15, 2019}}</ref> Hurricane Barry only produced hurricane-force winds in a small area of Louisiana.
