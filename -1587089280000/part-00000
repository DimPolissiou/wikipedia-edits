The Underworld of the ''Underneath the Radar'' and ''Change the Weather'' period is sometimes also referred to as being \"Underworld Mk1\".\n\n=== Underworld Mk2 ===\n{{Listen\n|filename=Underworld Rez.ogg\n|title=\"Rez\"\n|description=The band's 1993 dance anthem, \"Rez\".\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nAfter a break\u2014to concentrate on, among other things, art/design project [[Tomato (design collective)|Tomato]]\u2014Hyde and Smith recruited DJ [[Darren Emerson]] and after several minor releases and remixes as Lemon Inter<!--This is the intentional spelling of the band name with one 'r'-->upt and Steppin' Razor readopted the Underworld moniker. They produced danceable [[techno]] as a trio (\"Underworld Mk2\").\n\nThe addition of Emerson completed Underworld's techno/rock fusion and seemed to eliminate the pop elements in the original duo's work. Their first album, ''[[Dubnobasswithmyheadman]]'', was considered more accessible than the group's earlier material and crossed a large spectrum of dance music. The signature Hyde lyrics were in place: poetic, hypnotic and whispered; mixing conventional song writing with the use of [[Found art|found material]] from overheard conversations, answering machine recordings and the like. Hyde had been the lead singer in Underworld Mk1 but the original Hyde/Smith dance material was lyric-free as was most of the electronic music emerging from the aftermath of [[acid house]].\n\n=== The ''Trainspotting'' breakthrough ===\nThe band's 1996 album, ''[[Second Toughest in the Infants]]'', was their second studio album with Emerson and achieved a degree of commercial success, due in part to its release coinciding with that of the film ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]''. The film featured \"Dark & Long (Dark Train)\", as well as the band's most commercially successful track to date, \"[[Born Slippy.NUXX]]\", which was originally released only as a B-side of a single and does not appear on the ''Second Toughest'' album. The single and the album showed Underworld maturing as a trio, mixing elements of [[techno]], [[House music|house]], [[drum and bass]] and [[experimental music]].\n\"Born Slippy.NUXX\" is one of Underworld's best-known tracks and is celebrated as one of the greatest dance tracks of the decade. It was originally released in 1995 as a B-side to \"[[Born Slippy]]\" but failed to catch on until it was included in ''Trainspotting''. The track has since sold over a million copies and appeared on countless [[Compilation album|compilations]], [[Mashup (music)|mashups]] and [[remix]]es.\n\n=== ''Beaucoup Fish'' era ===\nAfter the release of fifth studio album ''[[Beaucoup Fish]]'' in 1999, Hyde declared in his interviews that he had sorted out earlier problems with [[alcoholism]] but all the members admitted that the sessions had been fraught with problems, with the individual members working in their own studios and only communicating via mixes of the raw material passed back and forth on [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]]. After the release of the album a large number of mixes of the album tracks seemed to surface on singles, magazine promotional CDs and similar ephemeral formats perhaps indicating the number of revisions the tracks had gone through to get to the point where they were acceptable to all three. The album's name derives from a sample of a Cajun fisherman in Louisiana on the track \"[[Jumbo (song)|Jumbo]]\". The band originally wanted to call the album ''Tonight, Matthew, I'm going to be Underworld'' (a catchphrase used by contestants on the UK [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] programme [[Stars in Their Eyes]]) but were convinced by their record company, [[Junior Boy's Own]], that the name would not be easily understood outside the UK. Finally, after all the singles had been released, a box set, ''[[Beaucoup Fish Singles]]'', which was a retrospective of all 4 singles came out.\n\nUnderworld embarked on a well-received tour in 1999, which resulted in a live CD and DVD drawn from several dates on the tour. Called ''[[Everything, Everything (album)|Everything, Everything]]'', the project captured the live Underworld experience very faithfully. A companion DVD was released separately soon after the album's release. The DVD features live footage of the band mixed with videography and artistic effects by the design group [[Tomato (design collective)|Tomato]]. The DVD also features several songs not on the album: \"Moaner\", \"Puppies\", \"Kittens\" and \"Rowla\". The disco scene in ''[[Vanilla Sky]]'' features Underworld's 1993 hit \"Rez\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0259711/soundtrack|title=Vanilla Sky (2001) |website=IMDb.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Back to a duo, ''A Hundred Days Off'', and online releases ===\nAfter the release and promotion of ''Everything, Everything'', Emerson decided to leave Underworld to focus on his solo projects and record label. Hyde and Smith decided to continue as a duo. They recorded a new album, ''[[A Hundred Days Off]]'', released to general approval. Despite its status as the band's first studio album since Emerson's departure, its general sound and feel was, perhaps surprisingly for many Underworld fans, not dissimilar to the previous albums on which Emerson had had input. In 2003, a 2-disc anthology entitled ''1992\u20132002'' was released. This was the first appearance on an album of previously unavailable single tracks and B-sides, such as \"Bigmouth\", \"[[Spikee]]\", \"Dirty\" and \"8 Ball\". While touring in the summer and autumn of 2005, the duo was joined on stage by Darren Price, a DJ and producer who had remixed Underworld releases in the past.\n\nDuring their tour, they released a 3-CD set ''[[Live in Tokyo 25th November 2005|Live in Tokyo]]'', which was sold after the concert in Japan and later sold online. In late 2005, they released two compilations of new songs with accompanying photographs on Underworld Live, in a series entitled ''[[Riverrun (Underworld project)|Riverrun]]''. These were only released online, with no physical release (except for a promo CD). On 5 June 2006, they released their third installment, and on 10 July 2006, they released ''The Misterons Mix'', a special retrospective mix composed of ''Riverrun'' tracks, as an exclusive free download for customers that had purchased all three ''Riverrun'' releases.\n\nIn September 2006, Underworld released five limited edition (10,000 copies each) [[12\"]] vinyl releases, containing remixes of various ''Riverrun'' tracks. These tracks were also made available for purchase by digital download on the [[Beatport]] website. Later in 2006, the band teamed up with [[Gabriel Yared]] to compose the music score to [[Anthony Minghella]]'s film ''[[Breaking and Entering (film)|Breaking and Entering]]''. [[Breaking and Entering (soundtrack)|The soundtrack]] was released in the UK on 6 November, and in the USA on 5 December.\n\n=== ''Oblivion with Bells''===\n[[File:Underworldlivenewyork2007 crop.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Underworld performing \"[[Jumbo (song)|Jumbo]]\" in [[Central Park]], [[New York City]], 2007.]]\nUnderworld's seventh studio album, ''[[Oblivion with Bells]]'', was released on 16 October 2007.

Approximately 30 masked Greek anarchists stormed the stadium while the [[Beastie Boys]] were performing. Rick Smith was one of the people injured in the ensuing violence and he was taken to a nearby Athens hospital for treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pr-inside.com/underworld-dj-injured-in-riot-r157510.htm|title=UNDERWORLD DJ INJURED IN RIOT|accessdate=31 August 2010}}</ref> On 19 October 2007, Underworld cancelled the remaining dates of their European tour due to illness in the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=26653_0_2_0_C|title=Underworld cancel tour after severe illness member|accessdate=24 October 2007}}</ref> The tour was picked up again on 28 January 2008, with a concert in Cologne, followed by 16 dates in Europe, including some festivals.\n\nOn 8 August 2008, Underworld appeared at the [[All Points West Music & Arts Festival]] in [[Liberty State Park]], New Jersey. [[Radiohead]] dedicated their final song \"[[Everything in its Right Place]]\" to Underworld with a special remix. Karl Hyde appeared with [[Brian Eno]] on the final day of the Eno-curated Luminous Festival at Sydney Opera House. \"Pure Scenius\" consisted of three live improvised performances on the same day, featuring Eno, Hyde, Australian improv trio [[The Necks]], electronic artist [[Jon Hopkins]] and guitarist [[Leo Abrahams]].\n\nUnderworld has released two new series via their underworldlive.com site, in mp3 and WAV formats. The tracks are 020202, and the phonestrap/autotrader series. On 3 July 2009, Underworld debuted a new song tentatively titled \"Between Stars\" at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]. Shortly before that, a post was made on the band's diary page showing a piece of paper with the song's first verse on it. On 8 August 2009, a show at Los Angeles' Forum was cancelled in circumstances similar to those that led to the group cancelling the show in Athens two years prior. Some of the crowd were climbing down the seats and onto the main floor, a potential safety hazard. The group apologized on their website for having the show called off.\n\nOn 8 March 2010 [[Mark Knight (musician)|Mark Knight]] and [[D. Ramirez]] released the single \"Downpipe\", which featured vocal contributions from Underworld's Karl Hyde. The song, released on Mark Knight's Toolroom Records label, has a music video featuring the \"Playhouse\", a lighting setup on Liberty Hall, the tallest building in [[Dublin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbghaUtVfJg|title=Downpipe music video|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=24 October 2007}}</ref>\n\n===''Barking''===\nOn 13 May 2010, the band released a track called \"Scribble\" for download on the band's site. The track shares elements with \"[[Live in Tokyo 25th November 2005|You Do Scribble]]\", an unreleased song which they featured many times since 2005 in their live performance shows. The track is a collaboration with [[High Contrast]], a [[drum and bass]] [[DJ]] also from Cardiff. On 14 May, the full version of \"Scribble\" was featured on [[Pete Tong]]'s [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] radio show, declaring it as [[Essential Selection|Essential New Tune]] of the week.<ref>{{cite web|title=BBC Radio 1 \u2013 Pete Tong |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006ww0v |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822183839/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006ww0v |archivedate=22 August 2015 }}</ref> The group also released a video clip for \"Scribble\" on [[YouTube]].

The album was available from the band's website and was packaged with the exhibition catalogue. In December 2010 it was announced that Underworld would reunite with ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]'' director Danny Boyle to write the musical score for his production of [[Frankenstein (2011 play)|Frankenstein]] at the [[Royal National Theatre]]. The production was broadcast as a part of [[National Theatre Live]] on 17 March 2011, with a soundtrack release on Underworld's website in March 2011. In February 2011 Underworld confirmed that they would play a huge London summer show on Saturday 27 August on Clapham Common as headliners of South West Four.\n\n=== ''Anthology,'' the Olympics and solo projects ===\nIn November 2011, Underworld announced two new compilations, ''A Collection'' and ''1992\u20132012 Anthology''. ''A Collection'' features many of the band's biggest tracks alongside recent collaborations with High Contrast featuring [[Ti\u00ebsto]] & Underworld (\"The First Note Is Silent\"), Mark Knight & D. Ramirez (\"Downpipe\") and [[Brian Eno]] (\"Beebop Hurry\"). ''1992\u20132012 Anthology'' is a 3-disc set and is a refreshed and revisited version of ''1992\u20132002'' with more material, unreleased tracks and rarities to go some way to completing the picture of the first two decades of Underworld.\n\nIn December 2011, Underworld were chosen to direct the music for the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], reprising their partnership with filmmaker and ceremony director [[Danny Boyle]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hanna |first=Laurie |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/music/2011/12/07/underworld-to-create-london-2012-opening-ceremony-music-115875-23616597/ |title=Underworld to create London 2012 opening ceremony music \u2013 Mirror Online |website=Mirror.co.uk |date=7 December 2011 |accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref> The band also contributed two original tracks for the opening ceremony: \"[[And I Will Kiss]]\" (ft.

Prominent former members include [[Darren Emerson]], from 1991 to 2001, and Darren Price, as part of the live band from 2005 to 2016.\n\nAfter performing as a [[funk]] and [[synth-pop]] band, resulting in two albums between 1988 and 1989, Underworld gained prominence, after reshaping in 1993, into the [[progressive house]] and [[techno]] band and releasing seven subsequent albums, including ''[[Dubnobasswithmyheadman]]'' (1994), ''[[Second Toughest in the Infants]]'' (1996), and the 1996 single \"[[Born Slippy .NUXX]]\". Known for visual style and dynamic live performances, Underworld have influenced a wide range of artists and been featured in soundtracks and scores for films, television, and the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London.\n\n== History ==\n=== Early years ===\nHyde and Smith began their musical partnership in Cardiff in 1979 with the [[Kraftwerk]] and [[reggae]]-inspired sounds of The Screen Gemz.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hugh|first1=Montgomery|title=How We Met: Rick Smith &amp; Karl Hyde|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/how-we-met-rick-smith-amp-karl-hyde-2130458.html|website=[[The Independent (UK)]]|accessdate=9 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Dorian|first1=Lynskey|title=Underworld's Dubnobass ... 20 years on|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/09/karl-hyde-rick-smith-underworld-1994-album-dubnobasswithmyheadman|website=[[The Guardian (UK)]]|accessdate=9 October 2017}}</ref> They were joined by The Screen Gemz' [[Bass guitar|bass]] player Alfie Thomas, [[drum]]mer Bryn Burrows, and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboardist]] John Warwicker in forming a proto-[[electroclash]]/[[New wave music|new wave]] band whose name was a graphic squiggle, which was subsequently given the pronunciation [[Freur]]. The band signed to [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]], released 1983's ''[[Doot-Doot]]'', and disbanded in 1986 after followup ''[[Get Us out of Here]]'' was withheld.<ref>{{cite web|title=Freur |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/freur-mn0000987643/biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=9 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1987, Hyde, Smith, Thomas, Burrows and bass player Baz Allen formed a band under the name Underworld (named after a [[Underworld (1985 film)|Clive Barker-scripted film]] which was scored by Freur),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/09/karl-hyde-rick-smith-underworld-1994-album-dubnobasswithmyheadman |title=Underworld's Dubnobass ... 20 years on |last1=Lynskey |first1=Dorian |date=9 October 2014 |website=[[Theguardian.com]]|accessdate=9 October 2014}}</ref> which tried a more guitar-orientated [[funk]]y [[electropop]] sound. The band signed to [[Sire Records]] and released the album ''[[Underneath the Radar]]'' in 1988 and, following the departure of Burrows, the album ''[[Change the Weather]]'' in 1989. This version of the band disbanded in 1990 and is supposedly regarded as a separate entity by the band's members to the one which would go on to release ''Dubnobasswithmyheadman'' (this album is therefore frequently referred to as being a debut). The Underworld of the ''Underneath the Radar'' and ''Change the Weather'' period is sometimes also referred to as being \"Underworld Mk1\".\n\n=== Underworld Mk2 ===\n{{Listen\n|filename=Underworld Rez.ogg\n|title=\"Rez\"\n|description=The band's 1993 dance anthem, \"Rez\".\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nAfter a break\u2014to concentrate on, among other things, art/design project [[Tomato (design collective)|Tomato]]\u2014Hyde and Smith recruited DJ [[Darren Emerson]] and after several minor releases and remixes as Lemon Inter<!--This is the intentional spelling of the band name with one 'r'-->upt and Steppin' Razor readopted the Underworld moniker. They produced danceable [[techno]] as a trio (\"Underworld Mk2\").\n\nThe addition of Emerson completed Underworld's techno/rock fusion and seemed to eliminate the pop elements in the original duo's work. Their first album, ''[[Dubnobasswithmyheadman]]'', was considered more accessible than the group's earlier material and crossed a large spectrum of dance music. The signature Hyde lyrics were in place: poetic, hypnotic and whispered; mixing conventional song writing with the use of [[Found art|found material]] from overheard conversations, answering machine recordings and the like. Hyde had been the lead singer in Underworld Mk1 but the original Hyde/Smith dance material was lyric-free as was most of the electronic music emerging from the aftermath of [[acid house]].\n\n=== The ''Trainspotting'' breakthrough ===\nThe band's 1996 album, ''[[Second Toughest in the Infants]]'', was their second studio album with Emerson and achieved a degree of commercial success, due in part to its release coinciding with that of the film ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]''. The film featured \"Dark & Long (Dark Train)\", as well as the band's most commercially successful track to date, \"[[Born Slippy.NUXX]]\", which was originally released only as a B-side of a single and does not appear on the ''Second Toughest'' album. The single and the album showed Underworld maturing as a trio, mixing elements of [[techno]], [[House music|house]], [[drum and bass]] and [[experimental music]].\n\"Born Slippy.NUXX\" is one of Underworld's best-known tracks and is celebrated as one of the greatest dance tracks of the decade. It was originally released in 1995 as a B-side to \"[[Born Slippy]]\" but failed to catch on until it was included in ''Trainspotting''. The track has since sold over a million copies and appeared on countless [[Compilation album|compilations]], [[Mashup (music)|mashups]] and [[remix]]es.\n\n=== ''Beaucoup Fish'' era ===\nAfter the release of fifth studio album ''[[Beaucoup Fish]]'' in 1999, Hyde declared in his interviews that he had sorted out earlier problems with [[alcoholism]] but all the members admitted that the sessions had been fraught with problems, with the individual members working in their own studios and only communicating via mixes of the raw material passed back and forth on [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT]]. After the release of the album a large number of mixes of the album tracks seemed to surface on singles, magazine promotional CDs and similar ephemeral formats perhaps indicating the number of revisions the tracks had gone through to get to the point where they were acceptable to all three. The album's name derives from a sample of a Cajun fisherman in Louisiana on the track \"[[Jumbo (song)|Jumbo]]\". The band originally wanted to call the album ''Tonight, Matthew, I'm going to be Underworld'' (a catchphrase used by contestants on the UK [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] programme [[Stars in Their Eyes]]) but were convinced by their record company, [[Junior Boy's Own]], that the name would not be easily understood outside the UK. Finally, after all the singles had been released, a box set, ''[[Beaucoup Fish Singles]]'', which was a retrospective of all 4 singles came out.\n\nUnderworld embarked on a well-received tour in 1999, which resulted in a live CD and DVD drawn from several dates on the tour. Called ''[[Everything, Everything (album)|Everything, Everything]]'', the project captured the live Underworld experience very faithfully. A companion DVD was released separately soon after the album's release. The DVD features live footage of the band mixed with videography and artistic effects by the design group [[Tomato (design collective)|Tomato]]. The DVD also features several songs not on the album: \"Moaner\", \"Puppies\", \"Kittens\" and \"Rowla\". The disco scene in ''[[Vanilla Sky]]'' features Underworld's 1993 hit \"Rez\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0259711/soundtrack|title=Vanilla Sky (2001) |website=IMDb.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Back to a duo ===\nAfter the release and promotion of ''Everything, Everything'', Emerson decided to leave Underworld to focus on his solo projects and record label. Hyde and Smith decided to continue as a duo. They recorded a new album, ''[[A Hundred Days Off]]'', released to general approval. Despite its status as the band's first studio album since Emerson's departure, its general sound and feel was, perhaps surprisingly for many Underworld fans, not dissimilar to the previous albums on which Emerson had had input. In 2003, a 2-disc anthology entitled ''1992\u20132002'' was released. This was the first appearance on an album of previously unavailable single tracks and B-sides, such as \"Bigmouth\", \"[[Spikee]]\", \"Dirty\" and \"8 Ball\". While touring in the summer and autumn of 2005, the duo was joined on stage by Darren Price, a DJ and producer who had remixed Underworld releases in the past.\n\nDuring their tour, they released a 3-CD set ''[[Live in Tokyo 25th November 2005|Live in Tokyo]]'', which was sold after the concert in Japan and later sold online. In late 2005, they released two compilations of new songs with accompanying photographs on Underworld Live, in a series entitled ''[[Riverrun (Underworld project)|Riverrun]]''. These were only released online, with no physical release (except for a promo CD). On 5 June 2006, they released their third installment, and on 10 July 2006, they released ''The Misterons Mix'', a special retrospective mix composed of ''Riverrun'' tracks, as an exclusive free download for customers that had purchased all three ''Riverrun'' releases.\n\nIn September 2006, Underworld released five limited edition (10,000 copies each) [[12\"]] vinyl releases, containing remixes of various ''Riverrun'' tracks. These tracks were also made available for purchase by digital download on the [[Beatport]] website. Later in 2006, the band teamed up with [[Gabriel Yared]] to compose the music score to [[Anthony Minghella]]'s film ''[[Breaking and Entering (film)|Breaking and Entering]]''. [[Breaking and Entering (soundtrack)|The soundtrack]] was released in the UK on 6 November, and in the USA on 5 December.\n\n=== ''Oblivion with Bells''===\n[[File:Underworldlivenewyork2007 crop.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Underworld performing \"[[Jumbo (song)|Jumbo]]\" in [[Central Park]], [[New York City]], 2007.]]\nUnderworld's seventh studio album, ''[[Oblivion with Bells]]'', was released on 16 October 2007.

Approximately 30 masked Greek anarchists stormed the stadium while the [[Beastie Boys]] were performing. Rick Smith was one of the people injured in the ensuing violence and he was taken to a nearby Athens hospital for treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pr-inside.com/underworld-dj-injured-in-riot-r157510.htm|title=UNDERWORLD DJ INJURED IN RIOT|accessdate=31 August 2010}}</ref> On 19 October 2007, Underworld cancelled the remaining dates of their European tour due to illness in the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=26653_0_2_0_C|title=Underworld cancel tour after severe illness member|accessdate=24 October 2007}}</ref> The tour was picked up again on 28 January 2008, with a concert in Cologne, followed by 16 dates in Europe, including some festivals.\n\nOn 8 August 2008, Underworld appeared at the [[All Points West Music & Arts Festival]] in [[Liberty State Park]], New Jersey. [[Radiohead]] dedicated their final song \"[[Everything in its Right Place]]\" to Underworld with a special remix. Karl Hyde appeared with [[Brian Eno]] on the final day of the Eno-curated Luminous Festival at Sydney Opera House. \"Pure Scenius\" consisted of three live improvised performances on the same day, featuring Eno, Hyde, Australian improv trio [[The Necks]], electronic artist [[Jon Hopkins]] and guitarist [[Leo Abrahams]].\n\nUnderworld has released two new series via their underworldlive.com site, in mp3 and WAV formats. The tracks are 020202, and the phonestrap/autotrader series. On 3 July 2009, Underworld debuted a new song tentatively titled \"Between Stars\" at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]. Shortly before that, a post was made on the band's diary page showing a piece of paper with the song's first verse on it. On 8 August 2009, a show at Los Angeles' Forum was cancelled in circumstances similar to those that led to the group cancelling the show in Athens two years prior. Some of the crowd were climbing down the seats and onto the main floor, a potential safety hazard. The group apologized on their website for having the show called off.\n\nOn 8 March 2010 [[Mark Knight (musician)|Mark Knight]] and [[D. Ramirez]] released the single \"Downpipe\", which featured vocal contributions from Underworld's Karl Hyde. The song, released on Mark Knight's Toolroom Records label, has a music video featuring the \"Playhouse\", a lighting setup on Liberty Hall, the tallest building in [[Dublin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbghaUtVfJg|title=Downpipe music video|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=24 October 2007}}</ref>\n\n===''Barking''===\nOn 13 May 2010, the band released a track called \"Scribble\" for download on the band's site. The track shares elements with \"[[Live in Tokyo 25th November 2005|You Do Scribble]]\", an unreleased song which they featured many times since 2005 in their live performance shows. The track is a collaboration with [[High Contrast]], a [[drum and bass]] [[DJ]] also from Cardiff. On 14 May, the full version of \"Scribble\" was featured on [[Pete Tong]]'s [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] radio show, declaring it as [[Essential Selection|Essential New Tune]] of the week.<ref>{{cite web|title=BBC Radio 1 \u2013 Pete Tong |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006ww0v |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822183839/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006ww0v |archivedate=22 August 2015 }}</ref> The group also released a video clip for \"Scribble\" on [[YouTube]].

Ramirez (\"Downpipe\") and [[Brian Eno]] (\"Beebop Hurry\"). ''1992\u20132012 Anthology'' is a 3-disc set and is a refreshed and revisited version of ''1992\u20132002'' with more material, unreleased tracks and rarities to go some way to completing the picture of the first two decades of Underworld.\n\nIn December 2011, Underworld were chosen to direct the music for the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], reprising their partnership with filmmaker and ceremony director [[Danny Boyle]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hanna |first=Laurie |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/music/2011/12/07/underworld-to-create-london-2012-opening-ceremony-music-115875-23616597/ |title=Underworld to create London 2012 opening ceremony music \u2013 Mirror Online |website=Mirror.co.uk |date=7 December 2011 |accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref> The band also contributed two original tracks for the opening ceremony: \"[[And I Will Kiss]]\" (ft.

Rats stopped choosing candy they preferred over other candy when it meant hurting an unfamiliar, neighbour rat. Reducing brain activity in the ACC by injecting a local anesthetic reversed this behaviour. Moreover, they showed that their harm aversion can be limited as most rats, which previously switched to the less-preferred candy to avoid harm to their neighbours, stopped doing so when offered a choice between one and three candies. Their experiments may show that the [[morality|moral]] motivation that keeps humans from harming other humans has old evolutionary origins and is shared to some degree with other animals. They also suggest some level of [[personality]] in rats as they showed a wide range of variable responses in the experiment \u2013 including indifference and not choosing any of the two levers after the first electric shock was registered.

Rats stopped choosing candy they preferred over other candy when it meant hurting an unfamiliar, neighbour rat. Reducing brain activity in the ACC by injecting a local anesthetic reversed this behaviour. Moreover, they showed that their harm aversion can be limited as most rats, which previously switched to the less-preferred candy to avoid harm to their neighbours, stopped doing so when offered a choice between one and three candies. Their experiments may show that the [[morality|moral]] motivation that keeps humans from harming other humans has old evolutionary origins and is shared to some degree with other animals. They also suggest some level of [[personality]] in rats as they showed a wide range of variable responses in the experiment \u2013 including indifference and not choosing any of the two levers after the first electric shock was registered.

Owned by [[Jimmy Lai]], the magazine is the number one news magazines in both markets in terms of audited circulation and [[AC Nielsen]] reports.  A Taiwanese version of ''Next Magazine'' was published from 2001 to 2018, and the online version of Taiwan's Next Magazine ended in 2020. The magazines featured [[tabloid journalism]] and were also two of the most controversial magazines in the region.\n\n== General ==\nFounded on 15 March 1990, ''Next magazine'' was the second most popular magazine in Hong Kong, until Jimmy Lai's other magazine, ''Sudden Weekly'', shuttered in 2015. It was published every Wednesday and cost 20 [[HKD]].  ''Next Magazine'' covered current affairs, political, economic, social and business issues, and entertainment news.  It consisted of two parts, the first focuses on news and commentary, while the second features entertainment and lifestyle information. Its motto is \"Don't put on airs; Just seek the truth\" (\u4e0d\u626e\u9ad8\u6df1 \u53ea\u6c42\u50b3\u771f).

The [[ACNielsen]] Hong Kong in March 2002: Media Index RARD Report (ACNielsen RARD Report) showed that 51% of its readers were aged 35 or above, 69% of them had completed secondary or higher education and 62% of them had monthly household incomes of 2\u202710<sup>4</sup> HKD or more.\n\n==Readership==\nIn 1991, the magazine became the most popular magazine in Hong Kong with the highest pass-along readership. Its circulation was 7.5\u202710<sup>4</sup> and readership was 3.15\u202710<sup>5</sup>. By 1995, its audited circulation had more than doubled to 162,521 and readership had jumped to 1.06\u202710<sup>6</sup>.  The number of pages in the magazine had also doubled, mainly due to an increase in advertising. The average (weekly) circulation during the period of 1 April to 30 June 2003 was 161,919. According to the March 2003 ACNielsen RARD Report, Next Magazine had the second highest readership among weekly magazines in Hong Kong after ''[[Sudden Weekly]]'', its sister entertainment news magazine under the same company.\n\n==Style and political position==\nThe magazine is known for its aggressive and flamboyant reporting styles. Their gossip-cooking stories and [[paparazzi]] pictures have often been criticised by celebrities. This style has led the magazine to being involved in many court cases and its stories have given rise to many controversies. At times, their \"reports\" are embroidered in such a manner that readers merely regard them as semi-fabricated stories containing the names of well-known personalities rather than serious pieces of journalistic writing. Though the magazine has a large circulation, its credibility rating is low.\n\nThe magazine's political position is [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] in that it supports minimum government control on economic matters. It is also known for its pro-democracy position.\n\n==Significant controversies==\n''Next magazine'' has often been criticised. Complaints about the magazine can be categorised into two types although it has a relatively large market:\n\n# Since the Control of Obscene and Indecent Articles Ordinance (Cap.390) was enacted in Hong Kong in 1994, ''Next Magazine'' has violated the law about 17 times and has received fines in the range [5\u202710<sup>3</sup>HKD,1.4\u202710<sup>4</sup>HKD] (http://ent.sina.com.cn/s/h/2002-10-11/1158105895.html). The Taiwan version of ''Next Magazine'' has also violated the law 4 times.  The public complained that the magazine posted the death portrait of Hong Kong actress Chan Po Lin, Pauline upon her death in Aug 2002.  The magazine was fined 5\u202710<sup>3</sup> HKD in respect of publication (http://ent.sina.com.cn/s/h/2002-08-20/171096497.html).\n# ''Next Magazine'' has been involved in several libel cases; the most significant case being a report in which it was claimed that there was a loss of 7\u202710<sup>7</sup> HKD by Project Hope, a charitable organisation in China, in Jan,1994. The magazine lost the case in 2000, and was fined 3.5\u202710<sup>6</sup> HKD (http://fpeng.peopledaily.com.cn/200006/22/eng20000622_43648.html).\n\n== Online version ==\nThere is an online version available for subscription from Hong Kong, Taiwan and overseas readers. atnext.com is a web site that contains news, entertainment and information.  It also provides an environment for companies to advertise. Online Advertising on Atnext.com is represented by Pixel Media HK Limited (www.pixelmedia-asia.com). Its innovative ads help many companies explore new markets and maintain existing markets.\n\nIn November 1999, when the Hong Kong online version of ''Next magazine'' was first launched, people could read the magazine free of charge on the internet, but a subscription fee is now charged.  Hong Kong subscribers, by paying 388 HKD [[year|y]]<sup>\u22121</sup>, can browse the websites of ''Next magazine'', ''AppleDaily'','' Easy finder'', ''Sudden weekly'' and ''Eat & travel weekly''.  Overseas subscribers can browse the websites by paying 498 HKD y<sup>\u22121</sup>. The website on horse racing (http://racing.atnext.com) has to be subscribed to separately (1 888 HKD y<sup>\u22121</sup>).\n\n==Next Media network==\nBesides ''Next magazine'', Next Media limited also owns one newspaper and several magazines: the ''[[Apple Daily]]'' (''\u860b\u679c\u65e5\u5831'' pinyin: P\u00edng Gu\u01d2 R\u00ec B\u00e0o), ''[[Easy Finder]]'' (''\u58f9\u672c\u4fbf\u5229'' pinyin: Y\u012b B\u011bn Bi\u00e0n L\u00ec ), ''[[Sudden Weekly]]'' (''\u5ffd\u71361\u9031'' pinyin: H\u016b R\u00e1n Y\u012b Zh\u014du ) and ''[[Eat & Travel Weekly]]'' (''\u98f2\u98df\u7537\u5973'' pinyin: Y\u01d0n Sh\u00ed N\u00e1n N\u01da ). All of which are printed by Database Gateway Limited since October 2001, but the major shares of the following two magazines, ''Sudden Weekly'' and ''Eat & Travel Weekly'' has sold to Malaysian [[List of conglomerates|media conglomerate company]] [[Astro All Asia Networks plc]] in November 2006, and sold the rest of shares of these two magazines in the end of 2008.\n\nFollowing the success of ''Next Magazine'' and ''Apple Daily'' in Hong Kong, the Taiwan branch of Next Media Publishing Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Next Media Limited, was set up in Taiwan on 31 May 2001. The emergence of Taiwan ''Apple Daily'' and ''Next Magazine'' introduced a completely different way of reporting in Taiwan.

A Taiwanese version of ''Next Magazine'' was published from 2001 to 2018, and the online version of Taiwan's Next Magazine ended in 2020. The magazines featured [[tabloid journalism]] and were also two of the most controversial magazines in the region.\n\n== General ==\nFounded on 15 March 1990, ''Next magazine'' was the second most popular magazine in Hong Kong, until Jimmy Lai's other magazine, ''Sudden Weekly'', shuttered in 2015. It was published every Wednesday and cost 20 [[HKD]].  ''Next Magazine'' covered current affairs, political, economic, social and business issues, and entertainment news.  It consisted of two parts, the first focuses on news and commentary, while the second features entertainment and lifestyle information. Its motto is \"Don't put on airs; Just seek the truth\" (\u4e0d\u626e\u9ad8\u6df1 \u53ea\u6c42\u50b3\u771f).

The [[ACNielsen]] Hong Kong in March 2002: Media Index RARD Report (ACNielsen RARD Report) showed that 51% of its readers were aged 35 or above, 69% of them had completed secondary or higher education and 62% of them had monthly household incomes of 2\u202710<sup>4</sup> HKD or more.\n\n==Readership==\nIn 1991, the magazine became the most popular magazine in Hong Kong with the highest pass-along readership. Its circulation was 7.5\u202710<sup>4</sup> and readership was 3.15\u202710<sup>5</sup>. By 1995, its audited circulation had more than doubled to 162,521 and readership had jumped to 1.06\u202710<sup>6</sup>.  The number of pages in the magazine had also doubled, mainly due to an increase in advertising. The average (weekly) circulation during the period of 1 April to 30 June 2003 was 161,919. According to the March 2003 ACNielsen RARD Report, Next Magazine had the second highest readership among weekly magazines in Hong Kong after ''[[Sudden Weekly]]'', its sister entertainment news magazine under the same company.\n\n==Style and political position==\nThe magazine is known for its aggressive and flamboyant reporting styles. Their gossip-cooking stories and [[paparazzi]] pictures have often been criticised by celebrities. This style has led the magazine to being involved in many court cases and its stories have given rise to many controversies. At times, their \"reports\" are embroidered in such a manner that readers merely regard them as semi-fabricated stories containing the names of well-known personalities rather than serious pieces of journalistic writing. Though the magazine has a large circulation, its credibility rating is low.\n\nThe magazine's political position is [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] in that it supports minimum government control on economic matters. It is also known for its pro-democracy position.\n\n==Significant controversies==\n''Next magazine'' has often been criticised. Complaints about the magazine can be categorised into two types although it has a relatively large market:\n\n# Since the Control of Obscene and Indecent Articles Ordinance (Cap.390) was enacted in Hong Kong in 1994, ''Next Magazine'' has violated the law about 17 times and has received fines in the range [5\u202710<sup>3</sup>HKD,1.4\u202710<sup>4</sup>HKD] (http://ent.sina.com.cn/s/h/2002-10-11/1158105895.html). The Taiwan version of ''Next Magazine'' has also violated the law 4 times.  The public complained that the magazine posted the death portrait of Hong Kong actress Chan Po Lin, Pauline upon her death in Aug 2002.  The magazine was fined 5\u202710<sup>3</sup> HKD in respect of publication (http://ent.sina.com.cn/s/h/2002-08-20/171096497.html).\n# ''Next Magazine'' has been involved in several libel cases; the most significant case being a report in which it was claimed that there was a loss of 7\u202710<sup>7</sup> HKD by Project Hope, a charitable organisation in China, in Jan,1994. The magazine lost the case in 2000, and was fined 3.5\u202710<sup>6</sup> HKD (http://fpeng.peopledaily.com.cn/200006/22/eng20000622_43648.html).\n\n== Online version ==\nThere is an online version available for subscription from Hong Kong, Taiwan and overseas readers. atnext.com is a web site that contains news, entertainment and information.  It also provides an environment for companies to advertise. Online Advertising on Atnext.com is represented by Pixel Media HK Limited (www.pixelmedia-asia.com). Its innovative ads help many companies explore new markets and maintain existing markets.\n\nIn November 1999, when the Hong Kong online version of ''Next magazine'' was first launched, people could read the magazine free of charge on the internet, but a subscription fee is now charged.  Hong Kong subscribers, by paying 388 HKD [[year|y]]<sup>\u22121</sup>, can browse the websites of ''Next magazine'', ''AppleDaily'','' Easy finder'', ''Sudden weekly'' and ''Eat & travel weekly''.  Overseas subscribers can browse the websites by paying 498 HKD y<sup>\u22121</sup>. The website on horse racing (http://racing.atnext.com) has to be subscribed to separately (1 888 HKD y<sup>\u22121</sup>).\n\n==Next Media network==\nBesides ''Next magazine'', Next Media limited also owns one newspaper and several magazines: the ''[[Apple Daily]]'' (''\u860b\u679c\u65e5\u5831'' pinyin: P\u00edng Gu\u01d2 R\u00ec B\u00e0o), ''[[Easy Finder]]'' (''\u58f9\u672c\u4fbf\u5229'' pinyin: Y\u012b B\u011bn Bi\u00e0n L\u00ec ), ''[[Sudden Weekly]]'' (''\u5ffd\u71361\u9031'' pinyin: H\u016b R\u00e1n Y\u012b Zh\u014du ) and ''[[Eat & Travel Weekly]]'' (''\u98f2\u98df\u7537\u5973'' pinyin: Y\u01d0n Sh\u00ed N\u00e1n N\u01da ). All of which are printed by Database Gateway Limited since October 2001, but the major shares of the following two magazines, ''Sudden Weekly'' and ''Eat & Travel Weekly'' has sold to Malaysian [[List of conglomerates|media conglomerate company]] [[Astro All Asia Networks plc]] in November 2006, and sold the rest of shares of these two magazines in the end of 2008.\n\nFollowing the success of ''Next Magazine'' and ''Apple Daily'' in Hong Kong, the Taiwan branch of Next Media Publishing Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Next Media Limited, was set up in Taiwan on 31 May 2001. The emergence of Taiwan ''Apple Daily'' and ''Next Magazine'' introduced a completely different way of reporting in Taiwan.  Next Media Network has confidence in being in the top three in the newspaper sector in Taiwan by using a new reporting style and its high quality of publication.\n\nNext Media Network is a great success in Hong Kong. Between 31 March 2002 and 31 March 2003, its total sales and net profit are about $2,150,100,000 and $367,600,000 respectively.  Comparing to 2002, the total sales has increased by 91.8% while the net profit has increased by 1284.4%.  For ''Next Magazine'' only, it just took 3 years to move to making a profit.\n\n== Major competitor ==\n''[[East Week]]'' has been the major competitor of ''Next Magazine'' for more than 10 years. ''East Week'' was first published by the Oriental Group in 1992, 2 years after ''Next Magazine''. ''East Magazine'' largely resembles ''Next Magazine'' in terms of reporting styles and coverage the logo of ''East Week'' is also similar to that of ''Next Magazine''. ''East Magazine'' does not have a significant effect on sales of ''Next Magazine'.

De Bortoli makes a wide range of wines including the sweet white [[Noble One]]. [[File:dbw bilbul 0603.jpg|right|thumb|De Bortoli Wines Bilbul Winery]]\n\n== Wineries and cellar doors ==\nDe Bortoli Wines owns three wineries in three diverse wine growing regions:\n* [[Bilbul, New South Wales|Bilbul]] near [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]] in the [[Riverina]] region of [[New South Wales]]\n* Near [[cessnock, New South Wales|Cessnock]] in the [[Hunter Region]] of New South Wales\n* [[Dixons Creek, Victoria|Dixons Creek]] near [[Yarra Glen, Victoria|Yarra Glen]] in the [[Yarra Valley]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]\n* [[Rutherglen,_Victoria|Rutherglen]] in the [[Rutherglen_wine_region|Rutherglen wine region]] in Victoria\n\nThe company has vineyards in the same regions as its wineries, along with the [[King Valley]] in Victoria.\n\nThe Yarra Valley Winery also boasts a very popular and highly awarded restaurant featuring Northern Italian inspired cuisine. There is now also a [[cheesemaker]] and cheese shop onsite at the Yarra Winery.\n\n==Winemaking==\nThe winemaking team is overseen by third generation winemaker [[Darren De Bortoli]] and his brother-in-law Steve Webber.  In the early 1980s [[Darren De Bortoli]] created the world acclaimed [[Noble One]] Botrytis Semillon. Steve Webber established the company's premium Yarra Valley winery in the early 1990s and is also responsible for overseeing the company's King Valley vineyards and Hunter Valley winery and vineyards.\n\nThe winemaking philosophy is that good wine begins in the vineyard, that the winemaker should use minimal handling and interference in the winemaking process and that wine should have a sense of regionality and be an expression of the soil in which it is grown.\n\n==Noble One==\nDe Bortoli Wines Noble One [[Botrytis cinerea|Botrytis]] [[Semillon]] is an award winning sweet white wine, developed by Darren De Bortoli during the 1980s. \n\nSince its release Noble One has been awarded 104<ref name=\"deb\">{{cite web|title=Noble One 25th Vintage Anniversary|url=http://www.debortoli.com.au/our-wines/our-brands/noble-one.html}}</ref> Trophies, 352 Gold medals<ref name=\"deb\"/> and 113 International Awards. In 2005 screw cap closures were placed on 50% of the 750ml bottles of 2003 Noble One in a trial that attempted to ensure fruit intensity and freshness for consumers. De Bortoli Wines have kept the 375ml, 50% of the 750ml and all export stock under cork, however in an industry where issues over [[cork taint]] keep arising approximately 34% of wines are sealed with some type of synthetic closure.\n\nNoble One was given its name in 1990 as a result of the bilateral agreement between [[Australia]] and the [[European Economic Community]] in which [[Australia]] agreed to phase out the use of European names on [[wine labels]]. Previously the wine was known as [[Sauternes (wine)|'Sauternes']] but today it is simply called Noble One.\n\n===Background===\nThe fungus [[botrytis cinerea]] is responsible for many of the great sweet whites of Europe including [[Sauternes (wine)|Sauternes]]. Botrytis develops on the grape bunches given the right moist and humid conditions. Botrytis spores leach moisture from the berries causing the fruit to break down, concentrating the [[sugars (wine)|sugars]] and magnifying the flavors to produce a very intense, complex wine. High humidity and moderate temperatures during April/May when the grapes are picked, and the high clay content of the soils creates a [[microclimate (wine)|microclimate]] that promotes the development of botrytis in the Riverina.\n\nGrapes for Noble One are grown on De Bortoli's own vineyards and those of a handful of selected growers. The grapes are picked by hand and the juice from each vineyard is fermented separately. The high sugar level presents a challenge during processing as the [[yeast (wine)|yeast]] struggles to ferment the juice, making [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] a long drawn out process. The fermentation has to be closely monitored because at these sugar levels acetic acid is produced by the yeast. Acedtic [[acid (wine)|acid]] adds complexity but it can spoil the wine if allowed to become too high. Extreme care also has to be taken to ensure the wine does not oxidise.\n\nOnce fermentation is completed the wines are [[clarified (wine)|clarified]], [[stabilized (wine)|stabilized]], and then aged in new French oak [[barrique]]s for an average of 12 months before blending and bottling.\n\n===History===\nDuring Darren De Bortoli's years at [[Roseworthy College|Roseworthy Agricultural College]], [[Australia|Australia's]] premier winemaking institute, a lot of development work was being done on Botrytis wine styles. While there, De Bortoli decided to make a botrytis affected wine of his own. At that time (1982) there was a surplus of Semillon grapes, a thin skinned, tight bunched varietal particularly susceptible to extensive, uniform botrytis infection. Growers were delighted to be able to sell their \"rotten\" grapes.\n\nThe resulting wine went on to win numerous awards including Best Botrytis Wine at the International Wine and Spirit Competition in 1984. Subsequent vintages were also largely successful. The exception was 1989 when heavy rains totally destroyed the crop.\n\nAs well as making Botrytis Semillon, De Bortoli Wines experimented with other botrytis styles including [[Sp\u00e4tlese]], [[Auslese]] and [[Beerenauslese]] with [[Riesling]] and [[Gew\u00fcrztraminer]]. In addition a Botrytis Pedro Ximinez and a Dry Botrytis Semillon were produced.\n\n==History==\nDe Bortoli Wines was established in 1928 by Vittorio & Giuseppina De Bortoli and rapidly expanded under the direction of their son, the [http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LC20031029056 late] [https://web.archive.org/web/20070831185346/http://debortoli.com.au/about-us/our-people/deen-de-bortoli.html Deen De Bortoli]. Today the company is in the hands of the third generation. The family history is documented in a book called Celebrazione! launched in 2003 to celebrate De Bortoli Wines' 75th Anniversary.\n\n===Darren===\n'''Darren De Bortoli''' (born 1960) is currently the managing director of De Bortoli Wines Pty Limited. He was born in 1960 and then studied winemaking at Roseworthy College in South Australia, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Applied Science in Oenology, in 1982. He is a former winemaker, for this family business, established in 1928 by his grandfather Vittorio De Bortoli. '''Darren''' is well known for his award winning Botrytis Semillon, Noble One. At the age of 33, Darren was appointed Managing Director, which is the position he maintains today. He is also a company director for this family organisation.\n\n'''Darren''' has helped the De Bortoli family achieve its position of Australia\u2019s 6th largest wine company, with an annual turnover of $170 million.  He was also featured in the 2002 episode of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]'s Dynasties television series titled \"The De Bortolis Of Griffith\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/dynasties/txt/s1010334.htm}}</ref> which tracked the growth over three generations of the family business from humble Italian immigrants into one of Australia's largest family wine companies.\n\nHe still lives with his family in [[Bilbul, New South Wales]], the village where De Bortoli Wines was established and still home to its head office and to one of its wineries.\n\n===Deen===\n'''Deen De Bortoli''' (born 1936) was the chairman of De Bortoli Wines Pty Limited. He was born in 1936, and at age 15 he left school to help Vittorio and Giuseppina, his parents run the family business. Deen was largely self-taught, but managed to build his fathers businesses to one of Australia's top six wine companies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/PARLMENT/hansArt.nsf/V3Key/LC20031029056}}</ref> He married Emeri De Bortoli in 1958, and lived in [[Bilbul, New South Wales]], his whole life.

De Bortoli makes a wide range of wines including the sweet white [[Noble One]]. [[File:dbw bilbul 0603.jpg|right|thumb|De Bortoli Wines Bilbul Winery]]\n\n== Wineries and cellar doors ==\nDe Bortoli Wines owns three wineries in three diverse wine growing regions:\n* [[Bilbul, New South Wales|Bilbul]] near [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]] in the [[Riverina]] region of [[New South Wales]]\n* Near [[cessnock, New South Wales|Cessnock]] in the [[Hunter Region]] of New South Wales\n* [[Dixons Creek, Victoria|Dixons Creek]] near [[Yarra Glen, Victoria|Yarra Glen]] in the [[Yarra Valley]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]\n* [[Rutherglen,_Victoria|Rutherglen]] in the [[Rutherglen_wine_region|Rutherglen wine region]] in Victoria\n\nThe company has vineyards in the same regions as its wineries, along with the [[King Valley]] in Victoria.\n\nThe Yarra Valley Winery also boasts a very popular and highly awarded restaurant featuring Northern Italian inspired cuisine. There is now also a [[cheesemaker]] and cheese shop onsite at the Yarra Winery.\n\n==Winemaking==\nThe winemaking team is overseen by third generation winemaker [[Darren De Bortoli]] and his brother-in-law Steve Webber.  In the early 1980s [[Darren De Bortoli]] created the world acclaimed [[Noble One]] Botrytis Semillon. Steve Webber established the company's premium Yarra Valley winery in the early 1990s and is also responsible for overseeing the company's King Valley vineyards and Hunter Valley winery and vineyards.\n\nThe winemaking philosophy is that good wine begins in the vineyard, that the winemaker should use minimal handling and interference in the winemaking process and that wine should have a sense of regionality and be an expression of the soil in which it is grown.\n\n==Noble One==\nDe Bortoli Wines Noble One [[Botrytis cinerea|Botrytis]] [[Semillon]] is an award winning sweet white wine, developed by Darren De Bortoli during the 1980s. \n\nSince its release Noble One has been awarded 104<ref name=\"deb\">{{cite web|title=Noble One 25th Vintage Anniversary|url=http://www.debortoli.com.au/our-wines/our-brands/noble-one.html}}</ref> Trophies, 352 Gold medals<ref name=\"deb\"/> and 113 International Awards. In 2005 screw cap closures were placed on 50% of the 750ml bottles of 2003 Noble One in a trial that attempted to ensure fruit intensity and freshness for consumers. De Bortoli Wines have kept the 375ml, 50% of the 750ml and all export stock under cork, however in an industry where issues over [[cork taint]] keep arising approximately 34% of wines are sealed with some type of synthetic closure.\n\nNoble One was given its name in 1990 as a result of the bilateral agreement between [[Australia]] and the [[European Economic Community]] in which [[Australia]] agreed to phase out the use of European names on [[wine labels]]. Previously the wine was known as [[Sauternes (wine)|'Sauternes']] but today it is simply called Noble One.\n\n===Background===\nThe fungus [[botrytis cinerea]] is responsible for many of the great sweet whites of Europe including [[Sauternes (wine)|Sauternes]]. Botrytis develops on the grape bunches given the right moist and humid conditions. Botrytis spores leach moisture from the berries causing the fruit to break down, concentrating the [[sugars (wine)|sugars]] and magnifying the flavors to produce a very intense, complex wine. High humidity and moderate temperatures during April/May when the grapes are picked, and the high clay content of the soils creates a [[microclimate (wine)|microclimate]] that promotes the development of botrytis in the Riverina.\n\nGrapes for Noble One are grown on De Bortoli's own vineyards and those of a handful of selected growers. The grapes are picked by hand and the juice from each vineyard is fermented separately. The high sugar level presents a challenge during processing as the [[yeast (wine)|yeast]] struggles to ferment the juice, making [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] a long drawn out process. The fermentation has to be closely monitored because at these sugar levels acetic acid is produced by the yeast. Acedtic [[acid (wine)|acid]] adds complexity but it can spoil the wine if allowed to become too high. Extreme care also has to be taken to ensure the wine does not oxidise.\n\nOnce fermentation is completed the wines are [[clarified (wine)|clarified]], [[stabilized (wine)|stabilized]], and then aged in new French oak [[barrique]]s for an average of 12 months before blending and bottling.\n\n===History===\nDuring Darren De Bortoli's years at [[Roseworthy College|Roseworthy Agricultural College]], [[Australia|Australia's]] premier winemaking institute, a lot of development work was being done on Botrytis wine styles. While there, De Bortoli decided to make a botrytis affected wine of his own. At that time (1982) there was a surplus of Semillon grapes, a thin skinned, tight bunched varietal particularly susceptible to extensive, uniform botrytis infection. Growers were delighted to be able to sell their \"rotten\" grapes.\n\nThe resulting wine went on to win numerous awards including Best Botrytis Wine at the International Wine and Spirit Competition in 1984. Subsequent vintages were also largely successful. The exception was 1989 when heavy rains totally destroyed the crop.\n\nAs well as making Botrytis Semillon, De Bortoli Wines experimented with other botrytis styles including [[Sp\u00e4tlese]], [[Auslese]] and [[Beerenauslese]] with [[Riesling]] and [[Gew\u00fcrztraminer]]. In addition a Botrytis Pedro Ximinez and a Dry Botrytis Semillon were produced.\n\n==History==\nDe Bortoli Wines was established in 1928 by Vittorio & Giuseppina De Bortoli and rapidly expanded under the direction of their son, the [http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LC20031029056 late] [https://web.archive.org/web/20070831185346/http://debortoli.com.au/about-us/our-people/deen-de-bortoli.html Deen De Bortoli]. Today the company is in the hands of the third generation. The family history is documented in a book called Celebrazione! launched in 2003 to celebrate De Bortoli Wines' 75th Anniversary.\n\n===Darren===\n'''Darren De Bortoli''' (born 1960) is currently the managing director of De Bortoli Wines Pty Limited. He was born in 1960 and then studied winemaking at Roseworthy College in South Australia, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Applied Science in Oenology, in 1982. He is a former winemaker, for this family business, established in 1928 by his grandfather Vittorio De Bortoli. '''Darren''' is well known for his award winning Botrytis Semillon, Noble One. At the age of 33, Darren was appointed Managing Director, which is the position he maintains today. He is also a company director for this family organisation.\n\n'''Darren''' has helped the De Bortoli family achieve its position of Australia\u2019s 6th largest wine company, with an annual turnover of $170 million.  He was also featured in the 2002 episode of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]'s Dynasties television series titled \"The De Bortolis Of Griffith\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/dynasties/txt/s1010334.htm}}</ref> which tracked the growth over three generations of the family business from humble Italian immigrants into one of Australia's largest family wine companies.\n\nHe still lives with his family in [[Bilbul, New South Wales]], the village where De Bortoli Wines was established and still home to its head office and to one of its wineries.\n\n===Deen===\n'''Deen De Bortoli''' (born 1936) was the chairman of De Bortoli Wines Pty Limited. He was born in 1936, and at age 15 he left school to help Vittorio and Giuseppina, his parents run the family business.
