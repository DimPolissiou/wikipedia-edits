The library consists of the central branch downtown, and four branch libraries.<ref name=\"about\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kpl.gov/about/ |title=About the Library |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=kpl.gov |publisher=Kalamazoo Public Library |accessdate= 29 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Old Public Library, Kalamazoo, MI.jpg|thumb|right|First library building in 1908]]\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:KzooPLibrary2.jpg|thumb|right|Second library building in 1959]] -->\n\nKalamazoo Public Library was founded in 1893. The building was designed in the [[Romanesque Revival|Romanesque Revival style]], with several wings and towers filled with windows to capture natural light. Ulysses Wheaton built the structure, which stood for 65 years.\n\nIn 1958, construction began on a new building inspired by [[Le Corbusier]]\u2019s ''[[Villa Savoye]],'' a two-story, 1930s-era building near [[Paris]], whose second level seems to float on columns surrounding a recessed ground floor. Designed by Louis C. Kingscott, Inc., and built by the Miller-Davis Company, the building opened in 1959, and combined the library and a museum.\n\nIn 1998, a new 4-story library building opened, which stands today at 315 South Rose Street in downtown Kalamazoo.\n\n==Branches==\n* Oshtemo - located on the west side of Kalamazoo, in [[Oshtemo Township]].  The building is the second largest branch, and features most of the features available at the Central branch.  The building's architecture is designed in such a way to allude to a castle. ''\"The whimsical new building arose like a [[medieval]] village around a castle.  Designed to appeal to children and the young at heart, it features colorful, basic geometric forms.\"'' Prior to discontinuation in 2010, the Oshtemo branch also housed the bookmobile. \n* Eastwood - located on the east side of Kalamazoo, in [[Kalamazoo Township]].  The original east side library was opened in 1912.  In 1996, the Eastwood branch took its current form when a new building was constructed.\n* Alma-Powell - located on the north side of Kalamazoo. In May 1968 an anonymous gift of $10,000 was received by the Kalamazoo Board of Education for the purpose of establishing a library in the poorest section of town. The library has been in many locations since, but currently is located within the Douglass Community Centre. \n* Washington Square - for more than 75 years, the branch has been a welcomed and welcoming fixture of the Edison Neighborhood.\n\n==Services and technology==\n[[File:KPLMyers080613-034 (9465827147).jpg|thumb|[[Walter Dean Myers]] speaks at KPL Central Library, August 6, 2013]]\n\nIn addition to traditional book lending and reference books, patrons of the library enjoy access to <!--please respect alphabetical order-->\n* Access to language learning programs\n* Booktoberfest.<ref name=\"about\" /><ref>{{cite news |last=Monacelli |first= Emily|date=16 November 2014 |title=Craft beer and books to be celebrated for Kalamazoo Public Library's inaugural Booktoberfest |url=http://www.mlive.com/beer/2014/09/craft_beers_and_books_combine.html |newspaper=mlive.com |location=Kalamazoo |accessdate= 29 November 2014 }}</ref>\n* County Law Library\n* Digital media lending (e-books, audiobooks)\n* Local History Room\n* Magazines and newspapers\n* Movie lending\n* Music lending\n* ONEplace - a management support center for [[nonprofit organization]]s\n* Programming\n** Adult programming\n** Children's programming (baby through teen)\n* \"Reading Together\" - annual community reading event\n* The Hub - a digital media lab\n* Bookmobile service, which began in 1956, was discontinued March 31, 2010.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.kpl.gov/news/?id=26015 |title=Bookmobile Service Ends March 31 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= 19 February 2010 |website=www.kpl.gov |publisher=Kalamazoo Public Library |accessdate=29 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Kalamazoo Public Library is technology friendly.

The building was designed in the [[Romanesque Revival|Romanesque Revival style]], with several wings and towers filled with windows to capture natural light. Ulysses Wheaton built the structure, which stood for 65 years.\n\nIn 1958, construction began on a new building inspired by [[Le Corbusier]]\u2019s ''[[Villa Savoye]],'' a two-story, 1930s-era building near [[Paris]], whose second level seems to float on columns surrounding a recessed ground floor. Designed by Louis C. Kingscott, Inc., and built by the Miller-Davis Company, the building opened in 1959, and combined the library and a museum.\n\nIn 1998, a new 4-story library building opened, which stands today at 315 South Rose Street in downtown Kalamazoo.\n\n==Branches==\n* Oshtemo - located on the west side of Kalamazoo, in [[Oshtemo Township]].  The building is the second largest branch, and features most of the features available at the Central branch.  The building's architecture is designed in such a way to allude to a castle. ''\"The whimsical new building arose like a [[medieval]] village around a castle.  Designed to appeal to children and the young at heart, it features colorful, basic geometric forms.\"'' Prior to discontinuation in 2010, the Oshtemo branch also housed the bookmobile. \n* Eastwood - located on the east side of Kalamazoo, in [[Kalamazoo Township]].  The original east side library was opened in 1912.  In 1996, the Eastwood branch took its current form when a new building was constructed.\n* Alma-Powell - located on the north side of Kalamazoo. In May 1968 an anonymous gift of $10,000 was received by the Kalamazoo Board of Education for the purpose of establishing a library in the poorest section of town. The library has been in many locations since, but currently is located within the Douglass Community Centre. \n* Washington Square - for more than 75 years, the branch has been a welcomed and welcoming fixture of the Edison Neighborhood.\n\n==Services and technology==\n[[File:KPLMyers080613-034 (9465827147).jpg|thumb|[[Walter Dean Myers]] speaks at KPL Central Library, August 6, 2013]]\n\nIn addition to traditional book lending and reference books, patrons of the library enjoy access to <!--please respect alphabetical order-->\n* Access to language learning programs\n* Booktoberfest.<ref name=\"about\" /><ref>{{cite news |last=Monacelli |first= Emily|date=16 November 2014 |title=Craft beer and books to be celebrated for Kalamazoo Public Library's inaugural Booktoberfest |url=http://www.mlive.com/beer/2014/09/craft_beers_and_books_combine.html |newspaper=mlive.com |location=Kalamazoo |accessdate= 29 November 2014 }}</ref>\n* County Law Library\n* Digital media lending (e-books, audiobooks)\n* Local History Room\n* Magazines and newspapers\n* Movie lending\n* Music lending\n* ONEplace - a management support center for [[nonprofit organization]]s\n* Programming\n** Adult programming\n** Children's programming (baby through teen)\n* \"Reading Together\" - annual community reading event\n* The Hub - a digital media lab\n* Bookmobile service, which began in 1956, was discontinued March 31, 2010.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.kpl.gov/news/?id=26015 |title=Bookmobile Service Ends March 31 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= 19 February 2010 |website=www.kpl.gov |publisher=Kalamazoo Public Library |accessdate=29 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Kalamazoo Public Library is technology friendly.

''Cinnamosma'' was erected in 1867, ''Warburgia'' in 1895, and ''Pleodendron'' in 1899. ''Capsicodendron'' was erected in 1933. Some authors accept ''Capsicodendron'' and assign to it two species, ''Capsicodendron pimenteira'' and ''Capsicodendron dinisii''.<ref name=\"zanoni2004\"/> Other authors subsume ''Capsicodendron'' into ''Cinnamodendron'' and ''C. pimenteira'' into ''C. dinisii''.<ref name=\"salazar2008\"/>\n\n[[Molecular phylogenetic]] studies of [[DNA sequence]]s have shown ''Cinnamodendron'', as traditionally circumscribed, is [[polyphyletic]], consisting of two distinct [[Clade|groups]].<ref name=\"salazar2008\"/> These groups are [[Plant morphology|morphologically]] different and their [[Range (biology)|ranges]] do not overlap.\n\nOne of these groups is [[Plant taxonomy|related]] to the [[Africa]]n genera ''Cinnamosma'' and ''Warburgia'', and might be [[paraphyletic]] over them.

The collection includes approximately 115,000 items in print and non-print format. The Library is open 66 hours a week, including evenings and Saturday and Sunday.\n\nThe Joplin Public Library District is a Special District, as are all library districts in Missouri.  In [[Jasper County, Missouri|Jasper County]], the library district includes all property within the Joplin city limits. In [[Newton County, Missouri|Newton County]], the library district includes only that portion of the City of Joplin which was within the city limits on October 13, 1965.\n\n==History==\nThe Joplin Public Library District was established in 1902 when the citizens of [[Joplin, Missouri]] voted for a 10 cent tax to operate a public library. A [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]] grant of $40,000 paid for the construction of a library building, with the community's having raised money to provide operating and maintenance funds.  The Carnegie Library was built at 9th Street and Wall Avenue and was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] later in the 20th century.\n\nAs needs outgrew the space, in 1980 the city built the current library at 300 S. Main Street, at a cost of approximately $2,000,000.  The new library building was opened to the public in May 1981.  In 1995 the building was remodeled and expanded to create the Rosemary Titus Reynolds Children\u2019s Library, which was dedicated in March 1996. The building, which covers approximately {{convert|35000|sqft|m2}}, is fully handicapped-accessible.\n\nThe new library was built on the site of the historic Connor Hotel,<ref>[http://www.historicjoplin.org/?p=7 Joplin Historic Society about Connor Hotel]</ref> which had to be demolished.  On November 11, 1978, one day before the hotel was scheduled to be brought down by explosives, it collapsed and trapped three workers in the rubble.  After being trapped for eighty-two hours, Alfred Sommers was successfully rescued.<ref>[http://www.koamtv.com/global/story.asp?s=11515234 www.koamtv.com about the collapse and rescue]</ref>  The two other workers were killed in the accident.  The three-and-a-half-day ordeal captured the attention of the entire nation.\n\nThe Library automated all circulation and technical processing operations in 1992 with federal funding under the Library Services and Construction Act. Off-site dial-in access, also federally funded, became available in 1995.  The following year the Library started offering free Internet access to patrons. In 1999, the Library introduced its Web site and provided access to its catalog on the Internet.\n\nIn 2013,the federal [[Economic Development Administration]] announced a $20 million grant for the development and construction of a new library on 20th Street, in the heart of the area destroyed by the [[2011 Joplin tornado]].<ref>Debby Woodin, [http://www.joplinglobe.com/news/grant-enables-th-street-project-to-move-forward/article_ec8b90ac-d227-56f2-b32c-1b3fd5968953.html?mode=jqm \"Grant enables 20th Street Project to move forward\"], ''[[The Joplin Globe]]'', May 22, 2013.</ref><ref>[http://www.koamtv.com/story/20512343/joplin-library-plans-to-relocate \"Joplin hires project manager for new library\"], [[KOAM-TV]],  January 5, 2013, updated August 18, 2014.</ref>\n\nIn June 2017, the new 58,000 square foot state-of-the art library opened to the public. Costing nearly $15,000,000, the new facility has meeting and event rooms and spaces, an outdoor plaza and courtyard, children's, teen and adult book collection areas, and maker-spaces and equipment for creative arts and business innovators.\n\n==Funding==\nThe Joplin Public Library District is funded primarily by a combination of real estate taxes and commercial surtaxes. Library-generated revenues and a city general fund subsidy also support the Library\u2019s operations. In 1993, Joplin voters approved an increase in the library levy from 9\u00a2 to 20\u00a2 per $100 valuation. Statewide reassessments since 1993 have resulted in several rollbacks, reducing the levy to 15.45\u00a2. In 2006, voters approved a 10\u00a2 levy increase, bringing the total levy to 25.45\u00a2 for that year. The levy will continue to decrease annually due to rollbacks.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\nPrimary source, Joplin Public Library Policy Manual, 2008\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.joplinpubliclibrary.org Joplin Public Library website]\n*[https://librarytechnology.org/library/1564 Libraries.org]\n\n{{coord|37|5|17|N|94|30|49|W|region:US_type:landmark|display=title}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Public libraries in Missouri]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Joplin, Missouri]]\n[[Category:1902 establishments in Missouri]]\n[[Category:Education in Jasper County, Missouri]]\n[[Category:Library buildings completed in 1980]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=September 2014}}\n\n{{Infobox library\n| name               = Joplin Public Library District\n| name_en            = <!-- Name in English if different -->\n| logo               = <!-- file name only (no Image: or File:) -->\n| logo_size          = \n| logo_alt           = \n| image              = <!-- file name only (no Image: or File:) -->\n| image_size         = \n| alt                = \n| caption            = \n| country            = United States\n| type               = \n| scope              = \n| established        = 1902\n| dissolved          = \n| ref_legal_mandate  = \n| location           = \n| coordinates        = \n| branch_of          = \n| num_branches       = \n| items_collected    = \n| collection_size    = \n| criteria           = \n| legal_deposit      = \n| req_to_access      = \n| annual_circulation = \n| pop_served         = \n| members            = \n| budget             = \n| director           = \n| num_employees      = \n| website            = http://www.joplinpubliclibrary.org/\n| references         = \n| embed              = \n| module             = \n}}\n'''Joplin Public Library''' District is the library services for [[Joplin, Missouri]].\n\nAs the largest public library between [[Springfield, Missouri|Springfield]] and [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]], the Joplin Public Library District attracts users from the tri-state area. The collection includes approximately 115,000 items in print and non-print format. The Library is open 66 hours a week, including evenings and Saturday and Sunday.\n\nThe Joplin Public Library District is a Special District, as are all library districts in Missouri.  In [[Jasper County, Missouri|Jasper County]], the library district includes all property within the Joplin city limits. In [[Newton County, Missouri|Newton County]], the library district includes only that portion of the City of Joplin which was within the city limits on October 13, 1965.\n\n==History==\nThe Joplin Public Library District was established in 1902 when the citizens of [[Joplin, Missouri]] voted for a 10 cent tax to operate a public library. A [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]] grant of $40,000 paid for the construction of a library building, with the community's having raised money to provide operating and maintenance funds.  The Carnegie Library was built at 9th Street and Wall Avenue and was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] later in the 20th century.\n\nAs needs outgrew the space, in 1980 the city built the current library at 300 S. Main Street, at a cost of approximately $2,000,000.  The new library building was opened to the public in May 1981.  In 1995 the building was remodeled and expanded to create the Rosemary Titus Reynolds Children\u2019s Library, which was dedicated in March 1996. The building, which covers approximately {{convert|35000|sqft|m2}}, is fully handicapped-accessible.\n\nThe new library was built on the site of the historic Connor Hotel,<ref>[http://www.historicjoplin.org/?p=7 Joplin Historic Society about Connor Hotel]</ref> which had to be demolished.  On November 11, 1978, one day before the hotel was scheduled to be brought down by explosives, it collapsed and trapped three workers in the rubble.  After being trapped for eighty-two hours, Alfred Sommers was successfully rescued.<ref>[http://www.koamtv.com/global/story.asp?s=11515234 www.koamtv.com about the collapse and rescue]</ref>  The two other workers were killed in the accident.  The three-and-a-half-day ordeal captured the attention of the entire nation.\n\nThe Library automated all circulation and technical processing operations in 1992 with federal funding under the Library Services and Construction Act. Off-site dial-in access, also federally funded, became available in 1995.  The following year the Library started offering free Internet access to patrons. In 1999, the Library introduced its Web site and provided access to its catalog on the Internet.\n\nIn 2013,the federal [[Economic Development Administration]] announced a $20 million grant for the development and construction of a new library on 20th Street, in the heart of the area destroyed by the [[2011 Joplin tornado]].<ref>Debby Woodin, [http://www.joplinglobe.com/news/grant-enables-th-street-project-to-move-forward/article_ec8b90ac-d227-56f2-b32c-1b3fd5968953.html?mode=jqm \"Grant enables 20th Street Project to move forward\"], ''[[The Joplin Globe]]'', May 22, 2013.</ref><ref>[http://www.koamtv.com/story/20512343/joplin-library-plans-to-relocate \"Joplin hires project manager for new library\"], [[KOAM-TV]],  January 5, 2013, updated August 18, 2014.</ref>\n\nIn June 2017, the new 58,000 square foot state-of-the art library opened to the public. Costing nearly $15,000,000, the new facility has meeting and event rooms and spaces, an outdoor plaza and courtyard, children's, teen and adult book collection areas, and maker-spaces and equipment for creative arts and business innovators.\n\n==Funding==\nThe Joplin Public Library District is funded primarily by a combination of real estate taxes and commercial surtaxes. Library-generated revenues and a city general fund subsidy also support the Library\u2019s operations. In 1993, Joplin voters approved an increase in the library levy from 9\u00a2 to 20\u00a2 per $100 valuation. Statewide reassessments since 1993 have resulted in several rollbacks, reducing the levy to 15.45\u00a2. In 2006, voters approved a 10\u00a2 levy increase, bringing the total levy to 25.45\u00a2 for that year. The levy will continue to decrease annually due to rollbacks.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\nPrimary source, Joplin Public Library Policy Manual, 2008\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.joplinpubliclibrary.org Joplin Public Library website]\n*[https://librarytechnology.org/library/1564 Libraries.org]\n\n{{coord|37|5|17|N|94|30|49|W|region:US_type:landmark|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Public libraries in Missouri]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Joplin, Missouri]]\n[[Category:1902 establishments in Missouri]]\n[[Category:Education in Jasper County, Missouri]]\n[[Category:Library buildings completed in 1980]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joplin_Public_Library"}

Constructed by one of the area's earliest settlers, it was later home to one of Freeport's most significant citizens.  After years of use as a house, it was converted into non-residential purposes, and it has been named a [[historic site]].\n\nDaniel Easley settled at the site of Freeport circa 1804 after migrating from Virginia.  The date at which he built the house is unknown, although it was certainly no later than 1820.  Later in life, Easley journeyed farther west and established the city of [[Freeport, Illinois|Freeport]] in [[Stephenson County, Illinois]].  Before leaving, he sold his home to the family of John Reaves, who gained a posthumous reputation as one of the village's significant early residents.  As a civilian, he was among [[Harrison County, Ohio|Harrison County's]] earliest teachers, and villagers honored him as the first Harrison County resident to die in the [[American Civil War|war of the rebellion]]; he was even the first man in the village to enlist after the fall of [[Fort Sumter]].  Reaves' home is a small brick building with a central entrance on the facade,<ref name=dohp>Owen, Lorrie K., ed.  ''Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places''.  Vol. 2.  [[St. Clair Shores, Michigan|St. Clair Shores]]: Somerset, 1999, 760.</ref> as well as a subsidiary side door.  The building is one and one-half [[storey|stories]] tall, resting on a stone [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]], with walls that rise to side-facing [[gable]]s topped with chimneys.<ref>{{OHC NRHP|77001068|Reaves, John, House}}, [[Ohio Historical Society]], 2007.  Accessed 2014-02-17.</ref>  Following Reaves' death, the house was converted into a commercial building; by 1888, it had become home to Freeport's first bank.

Constructed by one of the area's earliest settlers, it was later home to one of Freeport's most significant citizens.  After years of use as a house, it was converted into non-residential purposes, and it has been named a [[historic site]].\n\nDaniel Easley settled at the site of Freeport circa 1804 after migrating from Virginia.  The date at which he built the house is unknown, although it was certainly no later than 1820.  Later in life, Easley journeyed farther west and established the city of [[Freeport, Illinois|Freeport]] in [[Stephenson County, Illinois]].  Before leaving, he sold his home to the family of John Reaves, who gained a posthumous reputation as one of the village's significant early residents.  As a civilian, he was among [[Harrison County, Ohio|Harrison County's]] earliest teachers, and villagers honored him as the first Harrison County resident to die in the [[American Civil War|war of the rebellion]]; he was even the first man in the village to enlist after the fall of [[Fort Sumter]].  Reaves' home is a small brick building with a central entrance on the facade,<ref name=dohp>Owen, Lorrie K., ed.  ''Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places''.  Vol. 2.  [[St. Clair Shores, Michigan|St. Clair Shores]]: Somerset, 1999, 760.</ref> as well as a subsidiary side door.  The building is one and one-half [[storey|stories]] tall, resting on a stone [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]], with walls that rise to side-facing [[gable]]s topped with chimneys.<ref>{{OHC NRHP|77001068|Reaves, John, House}}, [[Ohio Historical Society]], 2007.
