Situated {{convert|341|km}} by road northeast of [[Mombasa]] that ends at [[Mokowe]] Jetty, from where the sea channel has to be crossed to reach Lamu Island. It is the headquarters of [[Lamu County]] and a [[UNESCO World Heritage site]].\n\nThe town contains the [[Lamu Fort]] on the seafront, constructed under [[Fumo Madi ibn Abi Bakr]], the [[Rulers of Pate|sultan of Pate]], and was completed after his death in the early 1820s. Lamu is also home to 23 mosques, including the Riyadha Mosque, built in 1900, and a donkey sanctuary.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe original name of the town is Amu <ref>Romero, Patricia (1997). ''Lamu. History, Society, and Family in an East African Port City''. Marcus Wiener Publishers, p. 10</ref>, which the Arabs termed Al-Amu (\u0622\u0627\u0645\u0648) and the Portuguese \"Lamon\". The Portuguese applied the name to the entire island as Amu was the chief settlement.\n\nLamu Town on Lamu Island is Kenya's oldest continually inhabited town, and was one of the original [[Swahili people|Swahili]] settlements along coastal East Africa. It is believed to have been established in 1370.<ref name=\"TIK\">{{cite book|title=This is Kenya|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TUtrgTb9hZ8C&pg=PA18|year=2005|publisher=Struik|isbn=978-1-84537-151-7|page=18}}</ref>\n\nToday, the majority of Lamu's population is [[Islam in Kenya|Muslim]].<ref>Oded, Arye (2000). ''Islam and Politics in Kenya''. [[Lynne Rienner Publishers]], p. 11</ref>\n\nThe town was first attested in writing by an Arab traveller Abu-al-Mahasini, who met a judge from Lamu visiting [[Mecca]] in 1441.\n\nIn 1506, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] fleet under [[Trist\u00e3o da Cunha]] sent a ship to blockade Lamu, a few days later the rest of the fleet arrived forcing the king of the town to quickly concede to pay an annual tribute to them with 600 Meticals immediately.<ref>[[Strandes, Justus]] (1971). \"The Portuguese in East Africa\". East African Literature Bureau. p.66.</ref>  The Portuguese action was prompted by the nation's successful mission to control trade along the coast of the Indian Ocean. For a considerable time, Portugal had a monopoly on shipping along the East African coast and imposed export taxes on pre-existing local channels of commerce. In the 1580s, prompted by Turkish raids, Lamu led a rebellion against the Portuguese. In 1652, Oman assisted Lamu to resist Portuguese control.{{sfn|Jackson|2009|p=89}}\n\n===\"Golden Age\"===\n[[File:LamuFort.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Lamu Fort]]]]\nLamu's years as an Omani protectorate during the period from the late 17th century to the early 19th century mark the town's golden age. Lamu was governed as a republic under a council of elders known as the ''Yumbe'' who ruled from a palace in the town; little exists of the palace today other than a ruined plot of land.{{sfn|Trillo|2002|p=555}}  During this period, Lamu became a center of poetry, politics, arts and crafts as well as trade. Many of the buildings of the town were constructed during this period in a distinct classical style.{{sfn|Trillo|2002|p=555}}  Aside from its thriving arts and crafts trading, Lamu became a literary and scholastic centre. Woman writers such as the poet [[Mwana Kupona]] \u2013 famed for her ''Advice on the Wifely Duty'' \u2013 had a higher status in Lamu than was the convention in Kenya at the time.{{sfn|Trillo|2002|p=555}}\n\nIn 1812, a coalition Pate-[[Mazrui]] army invaded the archipelago during the [[Battle of Shela]]. They landed at Shela with the intention of capturing Lamu and completing the fort which had begun to be constructed, but were violently suppressed by the locals in their boats on the beach as they tried to flee.{{sfn|Trillo|2002|p=555}} In fear of future attacks, Lamu appealed to the Omanis for a [[Busaidi]] garrison to operate at the new fort and help protect the area from Mazrui rebels along the Kenyan coast.{{sfn|Trillo|2002|p=555}}\n\n===Colonial period===\nIn the middle of the 19th century, Lamu came under the political influence of the [[sultan of Zanzibar]].\nThe Germans claimed [[Wituland]] in June 1885.{{sfn|McIntyre|McIntyre|2013|p=22}} The Germans considered Lamu to be of strategical importance and an ideal place for a base.{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|2009|p=330}} From 22 November 1888 to 3 March 1891, there was a German post office in Lamu to facilitate communication within the German protectorate in the sultanate.

The old city is inscribed on the [[World Heritage List]] as \"the oldest and best-preserved Swahili settlement in East Africa\".\n\nOnce a center for the [[slave trade]], the population of Lamu is ethnically diverse. Lamu was on the main Arabian trading routes, and as a result, the population is largely [[Muslim]].{{sfn|Trillo|2002|p=566}} To respect the Muslim inhabitants, tourists in town are expected to wear more than shorts or bikinis.\n\nThere are several museums, including the [[Lamu Museum]], home to the island's ceremonial [[horn (anatomy)|horn]] (called ''siwa'');{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|2006|p=343}} other museums are dedicated to [[Swahili culture]] and to the local [[Mail|postal service]]. Notable buildings in Lamu town include:\n\n===Lamu Fort===\n\nLamu Fort is a fort in the town. [[Fumo Madi ibn Abi Bakr]], the [[Rulers of Pate|sultan of Pate]], started to build the fort on the seafront, to protect members of his unpopular government. He died in 1809, before the first storey of the fort was completed. The fort was completed by the early 1820s.\n\n===Riyadha Mosque===\n[[File:LAMU Riyadha Mosque.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Riyadha Mosque]]\n[[Habib Salih]], a [[Sharif]] with family connections to the [[Hadramaut]], [[Yemen]], settled on Lamu in the 1880s, and became a highly respected religious teacher. Habib Salih had great success gathering students around him, and in 1900 the Riyadha Mosque was built.{{sfn|Briggs|2010|p=204}} He introduced [[Simthud Durar|Habshi ''Maulidi'']], where his students sang verse passages accompanied by tambourines. After his death in 1935 his sons continued the [[madrassa]], which became one of the most prestigious centres for Islamic studies in East Africa. The Mosque is the centre for the Maulidi Festival, which are held every year during the last week of the month of the [[Muhammad|Prophet]]'s birth. During this festival, pilgrims from [[Sudan]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Uganda]], [[Zanzibar]] and [[Tanzania]] join the locals to sing the praise of Mohammad. Mnarani Mosque is also of note.\n\n===Donkey sanctuary===\nSince the island has no motorised vehicles, transportation and other heavy work is done with the help of donkeys. There are some 3000 donkeys on the island.{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|2009|p=330}} Dr. [[Elisabeth Svendsen]] of [[The Donkey Sanctuary]] in England first visited Lamu in 1985. Worried by the conditions for the donkeys, the Sanctuary was opened in 1987.{{sfn|Trillo|2002|p=566}} The Sanctuary provides treatment to all donkeys free of charge.\n\n==Culture==\nLamu is home to the [[Maulidi]] Festival, held in January or February, which celebrates Mohammed's birth. It features a range of activities from \"donkey races to [[dhow]]-sailing events and swimming competitions\".{{sfn|Bain|Bruyn|Williams|2010|p=284}} The Lamu Cultural Festival, a colourful carnival, {{Sfn|Ham|Butler|Starnes|2012|p=215}} is usually held in the last week of August, which since 2000 has featured traditional dancing, crafts including ''kofia'' embroidery, and dhow races.{{sfn|Parkinson|Phillips|Gourlay|2006|p=219}} The Donkey Awards, with prizes given to the finest donkeys, are given in March/April.{{sfn|Parkinson|Phillips|Gourlay|2006|p=219}} Women's music in the town is also of note and they perform the ''[[chakacha]]'', a wedding dance. Men perform the ''hanzua'' (a sword dance) and wear ''[[kanzu]]s''.{{sfn|Senoga-Zake|1986|p=68}}\n\nLamu Old Town was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2001, based on 3 criteria:\n* The architecture and urban structure of Lamu graphically demonstrate the cultural influences that have come together there over several hundred years from Europe, [[Arabia]], and [[India]], utilising traditional Swahili techniques to produce a distinct culture.\n* The growth and decline of the seaports on the East African coast and interaction between the [[Bantu people|Bantu]], Arabs, [[Persian people|Persians]], Indians, and Europeans represents a significant cultural and economic phase in the history of the region which finds its most outstanding expression in Lamu Old Town.\n* Its paramount trading role and its attraction for scholars and teachers gave Lamu an important religious function in the region, which it maintains to this day.<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1055 Lamu Old Town], UNESCO</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Lamu eseltransport.JPG|thumb|upright=1.25|Locals using a donkey for transport]]\nIn 2011, proposals were being advanced to build a deep-water port which would have much greater capacity in terms of depth of water, number of berths, and ability for vessels to arrive and depart at the same time than the country's main port at [[Mombasa]].<ref>''[[African Business]]'', May 2011</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe song \"Lamu\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelwsmith.com/ |title=Artist, Christian, Worship Leader \u2013 Community, News, Tour Dates, Cruise and More |publisher=Michael W.

Situated {{convert|341|km}} by road northeast of [[Mombasa]] that ends at [[Mokowe]] Jetty, from where the sea channel has to be crossed to reach Lamu Island. It is the headquarters of [[Lamu County]] and a [[UNESCO World Heritage site]].\n\nThe town contains the [[Lamu Fort]] on the seafront, constructed under [[Fumo Madi ibn Abi Bakr]], the [[Rulers of Pate|sultan of Pate]], and was completed after his death in the early 1820s. Lamu is also home to 23 mosques, including the Riyadha Mosque, built in 1900, and a donkey sanctuary.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe original name of the town is Amu <ref>Romero, Patricia (1997). ''Lamu. History, Society, and Family in an East African Port City''. Marcus Wiener Publishers, p. 10</ref>, which the Arabs termed Al-Amu (\u0622\u0627\u0645\u0648) and the Portuguese \"Lamon\". The Portuguese applied the name to the entire island as Amu was the chief settlement.\n\nLamu Town on Lamu Island is Kenya's oldest continually inhabited town, and was one of the original [[Swahili people|Swahili]] settlements along coastal East Africa. It is believed to have been established in 1370.<ref name=\"TIK\">{{cite book|title=This is Kenya|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TUtrgTb9hZ8C&pg=PA18|year=2005|publisher=Struik|isbn=978-1-84537-151-7|page=18}}</ref>\n\nToday, the majority of Lamu's population is [[Islam in Kenya|Muslim]].<ref>Oded, Arye (2000). ''Islam and Politics in Kenya''. [[Lynne Rienner Publishers]], p. 11</ref>\n\nThe town was first attested in writing by an Arab traveller Abu-al-Mahasini, who met a judge from Lamu visiting [[Mecca]] in 1441.\n\nIn 1506, the [[Portuguese]] fleet under [[Trist\u00e3o da Cunha]] sent a ship to blockade Lamu, a few days later the rest of the fleet arrived forcing the king of the town to quickly concede to pay an annual tribute to them with 600 Meticals immediately.<ref>[[Strandes, Justus]] (1971). \"The Portuguese in East Africa\". East African Literature Bureau. p.66.</ref>  The Portuguese action was prompted by the nation's successful mission to control trade along the coast of the Indian Ocean. For a considerable time, Portugal had a monopoly on shipping along the East African coast and imposed export taxes on pre-existing local channels of commerce. In the 1580s, prompted by Turkish raids, Lamu led a rebellion against the Portuguese. In 1652, Oman assisted Lamu to resist Portuguese control.{{sfn|Jackson|2009|p=89}}\n\n===\"Golden Age\"===\n[[File:LamuFort.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Lamu Fort]]]]\nLamu's years as an Omani protectorate during the period from the late 17th century to the early 19th century mark the town's golden age. Lamu was governed as a republic under a council of elders known as the ''Yumbe'' who ruled from a palace in the town; little exists of the palace today other than a ruined plot of land.{{sfn|Trillo|2002|p=555}}  During this period, Lamu became a center of poetry, politics, arts and crafts as well as trade. Many of the buildings of the town were constructed during this period in a distinct classical style.{{sfn|Trillo|2002|p=555}}  Aside from its thriving arts and crafts trading, Lamu became a literary and scholastic centre. Woman writers such as the poet [[Mwana Kupona]] \u2013 famed for her ''Advice on the Wifely Duty'' \u2013 had a higher status in Lamu than was the convention in Kenya at the time.{{sfn|Trillo|2002|p=555}}\n\nIn 1812, a coalition Pate-[[Mazrui]] army invaded the archipelago during the [[Battle of Shela]]. They landed at Shela with the intention of capturing Lamu and completing the fort which had begun to be constructed, but were violently suppressed by the locals in their boats on the beach as they tried to flee.{{sfn|Trillo|2002|p=555}} In fear of future attacks, Lamu appealed to the Omanis for a [[Busaidi]] garrison to operate at the new fort and help protect the area from Mazrui rebels along the Kenyan coast.{{sfn|Trillo|2002|p=555}}\n\n===Colonial period===\nIn the middle of the 19th century, Lamu came under the political influence of the [[sultan of Zanzibar]].\nThe Germans claimed [[Wituland]] in June 1885.{{sfn|McIntyre|McIntyre|2013|p=22}} The Germans considered Lamu to be of strategical importance and an ideal place for a base.{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|2009|p=330}} From 22 November 1888 to 3 March 1891, there was a German post office in Lamu to facilitate communication within the German protectorate in the sultanate. It was the first post office to be established on the East African coast; today there is a museum in Lamu dedicated to it: the German Post Office Museum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museums.or.ke/content/view/53/24/|title=Lamu: German Post Office Historical \u2013 Background|publisher=National Museums of Kenya|accessdate=9 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624142945/http://www.museums.or.ke/content/view/53/24/|archivedate=24 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 1890, Lamu and Kenya fell under [[British Kenya|British colonial rule]] by the terms of the [[Heligoland\u2013Zanzibar Treaty]].

In addition to the abolition of slavery, construction of the [[Rail transport in Kenya|Uganda Railroad]] in 1901 (which started from the competing port of Mombasa) significantly hampered Lamu's economy.\n\nTourism has gradually refuelled the local economy in recent times, and it is a popular destination for backpackers.

The old city is inscribed on the [[World Heritage List]] as \"the oldest and best-preserved Swahili settlement in East Africa\".\n\nOnce a center for the [[slave trade]], the population of Lamu is ethnically diverse. Lamu was on the main Arabian trading routes, and as a result, the population is largely [[Muslim]].{{sfn|Trillo|2002|p=566}} To respect the Muslim inhabitants, tourists in town are expected to wear more than shorts or bikinis.\n\nThere are several museums, including the [[Lamu Museum]], home to the island's ceremonial [[horn (anatomy)|horn]] (called ''siwa'');{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|2006|p=343}} other museums are dedicated to [[Swahili culture]] and to the local [[Mail|postal service]]. Notable buildings in Lamu town include:\n\n===Lamu Fort===\n\nLamu Fort is a fort in the town. [[Fumo Madi ibn Abi Bakr]], the [[Rulers of Pate|sultan of Pate]], started to build the fort on the seafront, to protect members of his unpopular government. He died in 1809, before the first storey of the fort was completed. The fort was completed by the early 1820s.\n\n===Riyadha Mosque===\n[[File:LAMU Riyadha Mosque.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Riyadha Mosque]]\n[[Habib Salih]], a [[Sharif]] with family connections to the [[Hadramaut]], [[Yemen]], settled on Lamu in the 1880s, and became a highly respected religious teacher. Habib Salih had great success gathering students around him, and in 1900 the Riyadha Mosque was built.{{sfn|Briggs|2010|p=204}} He introduced [[Simthud Durar|Habshi ''Maulidi'']], where his students sang verse passages accompanied by tambourines. After his death in 1935 his sons continued the [[madrassa]], which became one of the most prestigious centres for Islamic studies in East Africa. The Mosque is the centre for the Maulidi Festival, which are held every year during the last week of the month of the [[Muhammad|Prophet]]'s birth. During this festival, pilgrims from [[Sudan]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Uganda]], [[Zanzibar]] and [[Tanzania]] join the locals to sing the praise of Mohammad. Mnarani Mosque is also of note.\n\n===Donkey sanctuary===\nSince the island has no motorised vehicles, transportation and other heavy work is done with the help of donkeys. There are some 3000 donkeys on the island.{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|2009|p=330}} Dr. [[Elisabeth Svendsen]] of [[The Donkey Sanctuary]] in England first visited Lamu in 1985. Worried by the conditions for the donkeys, the Sanctuary was opened in 1987.{{sfn|Trillo|2002|p=566}} The Sanctuary provides treatment to all donkeys free of charge.\n\n==Culture==\nLamu is home to the [[Maulidi]] Festival, held in January or February, which celebrates Mohammed's birth. It features a range of activities from \"donkey races to [[dhow]]-sailing events and swimming competitions\".{{sfn|Bain|Bruyn|Williams|2010|p=284}} The Lamu Cultural Festival, a colourful carnival, {{Sfn|Ham|Butler|Starnes|2012|p=215}} is usually held in the last week of August, which since 2000 has featured traditional dancing, crafts including ''kofia'' embroidery, and dhow races.{{sfn|Parkinson|Phillips|Gourlay|2006|p=219}} The Donkey Awards, with prizes given to the finest donkeys, are given in March/April.{{sfn|Parkinson|Phillips|Gourlay|2006|p=219}} Women's music in the town is also of note and they perform the ''[[chakacha]]'', a wedding dance. Men perform the ''hanzua'' (a sword dance) and wear ''[[kanzu]]s''.{{sfn|Senoga-Zake|1986|p=68}}\n\nLamu Old Town was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2001, based on 3 criteria:\n* The architecture and urban structure of Lamu graphically demonstrate the cultural influences that have come together there over several hundred years from Europe, [[Arabia]], and [[India]], utilising traditional Swahili techniques to produce a distinct culture.\n* The growth and decline of the seaports on the East African coast and interaction between the [[Bantu people|Bantu]], Arabs, [[Persian people|Persians]], Indians, and Europeans represents a significant cultural and economic phase in the history of the region which finds its most outstanding expression in Lamu Old Town.\n* Its paramount trading role and its attraction for scholars and teachers gave Lamu an important religious function in the region, which it maintains to this day.<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1055 Lamu Old Town], UNESCO</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Lamu eseltransport.JPG|thumb|upright=1.25|Locals using a donkey for transport]]\nIn 2011, proposals were being advanced to build a deep-water port which would have much greater capacity in terms of depth of water, number of berths, and ability for vessels to arrive and depart at the same time than the country's main port at [[Mombasa]].<ref>''[[African Business]]'', May 2011</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe song \"Lamu\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelwsmith.com/ |title=Artist, Christian, Worship Leader \u2013 Community, News, Tour Dates, Cruise and More |publisher=Michael W.

During the [[Neolithic Europe|Neolithic era]] and the time of the [[Indo-European migrations]] Europe saw human inflows from east and southeast and subsequent important cultural and material exchange. The period known as [[classical antiquity]] began with the emergence of the city-states of [[ancient Greece]]. Later, the [[Roman Empire]] came to dominate the entire [[Mediterranean basin]]. The fall of the Roman Empire in AD 476 traditionally marks the start of the [[Middle Ages]]. Beginning in the 14th century a [[Renaissance]] of knowledge challenged traditional doctrines in science and theology. Simultaneously, the [[Protestant Reformation]] set up Protestant churches primarily in Germany, Scandinavia and England. After 1800, the [[Industrial Revolution]] brought prosperity to Britain and Western Europe. The main powers set up colonies in most of the Americas and Africa, and parts of Asia. In the 20th century, [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] resulted in massive numbers of deaths. The [[Cold War]] dominated European geo-politics from 1947 to 1989.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Overview==\nDuring the [[Neolithic Europe|Neolithic era]] (starting at c.\u20097000 BC.) and the time of the [[Indo-European migrations]] (starting at c.\u20094000 BC.) Europe saw massive migrations from east and southeast which also brought agriculture, new technologies, and the Indo-European languages, primarily through the areas of the [[Balkan peninsula]] and the [[Black sea]] region.\n\nSome of the best-known civilizations of the late prehistoric Europe were the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]], which flourished during the [[Bronze Age]] until they [[Bronze Age collapse|collapsed]] in a short period of time around 1200 BC.\n\nThe period known as [[classical antiquity]] began with the emergence of the city-states of [[Ancient Greece]]. After ultimately checking the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] advance in Europe through the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] in the 5th century BC, Greek influence reached its zenith under the expansive empire of [[Alexander the Great]], spreading throughout [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and other parts of Europe. The [[Thracians]] and their [[Odrysian kingdom|kingdoms]] and [[Thracian treasure|culture]] were long present in [[Southeast Europe]]. The [[Roman Empire]] came to dominate the entire [[Mediterranean basin]]. By 300 AD the Roman Empire was divided into the [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] and [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern]] empires. During the 4th and 5th centuries, the [[Germanic peoples]] of [[Northern Europe]], pressed by the [[Huns]], grew in strength and led repeated attacks that resulted in the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]]. The Western empire's collapse in AD 476 traditionally marks the end of the classical period and the start of the [[Middle Ages]].\n\nIn [[Western Europe]], Germanic peoples became more powerful in the remnants of the former Western Roman Empire and established kingdoms and empires of their own. Of all of the Germanic peoples, the [[Franks]] would rise to a position of [[hegemony]] over Western Europe, the [[Frankish Empire]] reaching its peak under [[Charlemagne]] around 800. This empire was later divided into several parts; [[West Francia]] would evolve into the [[Kingdom of France]], while [[East Francia]] would evolve into the [[Holy Roman Empire]], a precursor to modern Germany and Italy. The [[British Isles]] were the site of several large-scale migrations.\n\nThe [[Byzantine Empire]] \u2013 the eastern part of the [[Roman Empire]], with its capital [[Constantinople]], survived for the next 1000 years as the most dominant [[List of empires|empire]] in [[Southeast Europe]]. The powerful and long lived [[Bulgarian Empire]] was its main competitor in the region. Both empires were major powers in that part of Europe for centuries, both creating [[Byzantine art|important]] [[Golden Age of medieval Bulgarian culture|cultural]], [[Third Rome|political]], [[Cyrillic script|linguistic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|religious]] legacy through the [[Middle Ages]] to this day.\n\nThe [[Viking Age]], a period of migrations of Scandinavian peoples, occurred from the late 8th century to the middle 11th century. The [[Normans]], descendants of the [[Vikings]] who settled in Northern France, had a significant impact on many parts of Europe, from the [[Norman conquest of England]] to [[Norman conquest of Sicily|Sicily]]. The [[Rus' people]] founded [[Kievan Rus']], which evolved into Russia. After 1000 the [[Crusades]] were a series of religiously motivated military expeditions originally intended to bring the [[Levant]] back under Christian rule. The Crusaders opened trade routes which enabled the merchant republics of [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] to become major economic powers. The [[Reconquista]], a related movement, worked to reconquer [[Iberia]] for [[Christendom]].\n\n[[File:Les Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du duc de Berry octobre detail.jpg|thumb|The peasants preparing the fields for the winter with a [[harrow (tool)|harrow]] and sowing for the winter grain, from ''[[The Very Rich Hours of the Duke of Berry]]'', c.1410|left]]\n\n[[Eastern Europe]] in the [[High Middle Ages]] was dominated by the rise and fall of the [[Mongol Empire]]. Led by [[Genghis Khan]], the Mongols were a group of [[steppe nomad]]s who established a decentralized empire which, at its height, extended from China in the east to the Black and Baltic Seas in Europe. As Mongol power waned towards the [[Late Middle Ages]], the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] rose to become the strongest of the numerous Russian principalities and republics and would grow into the [[Tsardom of Russia]] in 1547. The Late Middle Ages represented a period of upheaval in Europe. The epidemic known as the [[Black Death]] and an associated famine caused demographic catastrophe in Europe as the population plummeted. Dynastic struggles and wars of conquest kept many of the states of Europe at war for much of the period. In Scandinavia, the [[Kalmar Union]] dominated the political landscape, while England fought with Scotland in the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] and with France in the [[Hundred Years' War]]. In [[Central Europe]], the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] became a large territorial empire, while the Holy Roman Empire, which was an [[elective monarchy]], came to be dominated for centuries by the [[House of Habsburg]]. Russia continued to expand southward and eastward into former Mongol lands. In the [[Balkans]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] overran Byzantine lands, culminating in the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, which historians mark as the end of the Middle Ages.\n\nBeginning in the 14th century in [[Florence]] and later spreading through Europe, a [[Renaissance]] of knowledge challenged traditional doctrines in science and theology. The rediscovery of classical Greek and Roman knowledge had an enormous liberating effect on intellectuals. Simultaneously, the [[Protestant Reformation]] under German [[Martin Luther]] questioned Papal authority. [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] seized control of the English Church and its lands. The [[European religious wars]] were fought between German and Spanish rulers. The [[Reconquista]] ended Muslim rule in [[Iberia]]. By the 1490s a series of oceanic explorations marked the [[Age of Discovery]], establishing direct links with Africa, [[the Americas]], and Asia. Religious wars continued to be fought in Europe, until the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]]. The [[Spanish empire|Spanish crown]] maintained its hegemony in Europe and was the leading power on the continent until the signing of the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]], which ended a conflict between Spain and France that had begun during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. An unprecedented series of major wars and political revolutions took place around Europe and the world in the period between 1610 and 1700.<ref>Geoffrey Parker, \"States Make War But Wars Also Break States,\"''Journal of Military History'' (2010) 74#1 pp. 11\u201334</ref>\n\n[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|thumb|A [[Watt steam engine]]. The [[steam engine]], fuelled primarily by coal, propelled the [[Industrial Revolution]] in 19th-century [[Northwestern Europe]].]]\n\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]] began in [[Great Britain|Britain]], based on coal, steam, and textile mills. Political change in [[continental Europe]] was spurred by the [[French Revolution]] under the motto ''[[libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9]]''. [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] took control, made many reforms inside France, and transformed Western Europe. But his rise stimulated both nationalism and reaction and he was defeated in 1814\u201315 as the old royal conservatives returned to power.\n\nThe period between 1815 and 1871 saw revolutionary attempts in much of Europe (apart from Britain). They all failed however. As industrial work forces grew in Western Europe, [[socialism]] and [[trade union]] activity developed. The last vestiges of [[serfdom]] were abolished [[Serfdom in Russia|in Russia]] in 1861. Greece and the other [[Balkans|Balkan nations]] began a long slow road to [[History of the Balkans|independence]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]], starting in the 1820s. Italy was unified in its [[Risorgimento]] in 1860. After the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870\u201371, [[Otto von Bismarck]] unified the German states into an empire that was politically and militarily dominant until 1914. Most of Europe scrambled for imperial colonies [[Scramble for Africa|in Africa]] and Asia in [[the Age of Empire]]. Britain and France built the largest empires, while diplomats ensured there were no major wars in Europe, apart from the [[Crimean War]] of the 1850s.\n\nThe outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914 was precipitated by the rise of nationalism in [[Southeastern Europe]] as the [[Great Powers]] took sides. The 1917 [[October Revolution]] led the [[Russian Empire]] to become the world's first [[communist state]], the [[Soviet Union]]. The [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], led by Britain, France, and the United States, defeated the [[Central Powers]], led by the [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], in 1918. During the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] the [[The Big Four (World War I)|Big Four]] imposed their terms in a series of treaties, especially the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The war's human and material devastation was unprecedented.\n\nGermany lost its overseas empire and several provinces, had to pay large reparations, and was humiliated by the victors. They in turn had large debts to the United States. The 1920s were prosperous until 1929 when the [[Great Depression]] broke out, which led to the collapse of democracy in many European states. The [[Nazi]] regime under [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in 1933, rearmed Germany, and along with [[Italian Fascism|Mussolini's Italy]] sought to assert themselves on the continent by demands and appeasement, leading eventually to the [[Second World War]]. Most of the fighting took place on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], and the war ended with the defeat of the [[Axis powers]], leaving the USSR and the United States dominating Eastern and Western Europe respectively.\nThe [[Iron Curtain]] now separated the east under Moscow's control from the [[capitalist]] West. The United States launched the [[Marshall Plan]] from 1948\u201351 and [[NATO]] from 1949, and rebuilt industrial economies that all were thriving by the 1950s. France and [[West Germany]] took the lead in forming the [[European Economic Community]], which eventually became the [[European Union]] (EU). Secularization saw the weakening of Protestant and Catholic churches across most of Europe, except where they were symbols of anti-government resistance, as in Poland. The [[Revolutions of 1989]] brought an end to both Soviet hegemony and [[communism]] in Eastern Europe. Germany was reunited, [[Maastricht Treaty|Europe's integration deepened]], and both NATO and the EU expanded to the east. The EU came under increasing pressure because of the [[Great Recession|worldwide recession after 2008]].\n\n==Prehistory of Europe==\n{{Main|Prehistoric Europe|Palaeolithic Europe|Mesolithic Europe|Neolithic Europe|Stone Age|Bronze Age Europe|Iron Age Europe}}\n\n[[File:Europe Prehistory.gif|250px|thumb]]\n\n''[[Homo erectus]]'' migrated from Africa to Europe before the emergence of modern humans.

The origins of this culture can be located in the [[Levant]] (Ahmarian) and Hungary (first full Aurignacian). By 35,000 BC, the Aurignacian culture and its technology had extended through most of Europe. The last [[Neanderthals]] seem to have been forced to retreat during this process to the southern half of the [[Iberian Peninsula]].\n\nAround 29,000 BC a new technology/culture appeared in the western region of Europe: the [[Gravettian]]. This technology/culture has been theorised to have come with migrations of people from the [[Balkans]] (see [[Kozarnika]]).\n\nAround 16,000 BC, Europe witnessed the appearance of a new culture, known as [[Magdalenian]], possibly rooted in the old Gravettian. This culture soon superseded the [[Solutrean]] area and the Gravettian of mainly France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal and Ukraine. The [[Hamburg culture]] prevailed in Northern Europe in the 14th and the 13th millennium BC as the [[Creswellian]] (also termed the British Late Magdalenian) did shortly after in the British Islands.\nAround 12,500 BC, the [[W\u00fcrm glaciation]] ended. Slowly, through the following millennia, temperatures and sea levels rose, changing the environment of prehistoric people. Nevertheless, Magdalenian culture persisted until c. 10,000 BC, when it quickly evolved into two ''[[microlith]]ist'' cultures: [[Azilian]] ([[Federmesser]]), in Spain and southern France, and then [[Sauveterrian]], in southern France and [[Tardenoisian]] in Central Europe, while in Northern Europe the [[Lyngby culture|Lyngby complex]] succeeded the Hamburg culture with the influence of the [[Federmesser]] group as well. Evidence of permanent settlement dates from the 8th millennium BC in the Balkans.\n\nThe [[Indo-European migrations]] started at around c.\u20094200 BC. through the areas of the [[Black sea]] and the [[Balkan peninsula]] in [[Eastern Europe|East]] and [[Southeast Europe]]. In the next 3000 years the [[Indo-European languages]] expanded through Europe.\n\nIn [[Varna Necropolis]] \u2013 a burial site from 4569\u20134340 BC and one of the most important archaeological sites in world prehistory, was found the oldest gold treasure (elaborated golden objects) in the world. <ref name=\"La Niece\">{{cite book |last=La Niece |first=Susan (senior metallurgist in the British Museum Department of Conservation and Scientific Research) |url=https://books.google.com/?id=oAfITjcHiZ0C&printsec=frontcover |title=Gold |page=10 |publisher=Harvard University Press |accessdate=10 April 2012 |isbn=978-0-674-03590-4 |date=15 December 2009}}</ref> Recently discovered golden artifacts treasure in [[Durankulak]], [[Bulgaria]], appears to be 7000 old.<ref> https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/oldest-gold-object-unearthed-bulgaria-180960093/</ref>\n\nThe [[Neolithic]] reached Central Europe in the 6th millennium BC and parts of Northern Europe in the 5th and 4th millenniums BC.\n{{Multiple image\n |align     = center\n |direction = horizontal\n |width     =\n |image1    = Neolithic expansion.svg\n |width1    = 240\n |alt1      =\n |caption1  = Map showing the Neolithic expansions from the 7th to the 5th millennium BC, including the [[Cardium pottery|Cardium culture]] in blue.\n |image2    = European-late-neolithic-english.svg\n |width2   = 255\n |alt2      =\n |caption2  = Late neolithic Europe in c. 4000\u20133500 BC.\n |image3    = IE_expansion.png\n |width3    = 240\n |alt3      =\n |caption3  = Scheme of Indo-European migrations from c. 4000 to 1000 BC according to the [[Kurgan hypothesis]]\n |image4    = Europe late bronze age.png\n |width4    = 230\n |alt4      =\n |caption4  = Late Bronze Age Europe.\n}}\n\n==Ancient Europe==\n===Minoans and Mycenae 2700\u20131100 BCE===\n[[File:Tholos of Atreus.jpg|thumb|170px|The Treasury of [[Atreus]], or Tomb of Agamemnon in Mycenae 1250 BC]]\n\nThe first well-known literate civilization in Europe was that of the Minoans.

Mycenaean civilization was dominated by a warrior [[aristocracy]]. Around 1400 BC, the Mycenaeans extended their control to Crete, the center of the Minoan civilization, and adopted a form of the Minoan script (called [[Linear A]]) to write their early form of [[Greek language|Greek]] in [[Linear B]].\n\nThe Mycenaean civilization perished with the [[Bronze Age collapse|collapse of Bronze-Age civilization]] on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea. The collapse is commonly attributed to the [[Dorian invasion]], although other theories describing natural disasters and climate change have been advanced as well.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Whatever the causes, the Mycenaean civilization had definitely disappeared after [[LH IIIC|LH III C]], when the sites of Mycenae and Tirynth were again destroyed and lost their importance. This end, during the last years of the 12th century BC, occurred after a slow decline of the Mycenaean civilization, which lasted many years before dying out. The beginning of the 11th century BC opened a new context, that of the protogeometric, the beginning of the geometric period, the ''[[Greek Dark Ages]]'' of traditional historiography.\n\n===Early antiquity period===\n{{Main|Classical antiquity}}\n\n[[File:Parthenon from south.jpg|thumb|The [[Parthenon]], an [[Ancient Athens|ancient Athenian]] Temple on the [[Acropolis]] (hill-top city) fell to Rome in 176 BC]]\n\nThe Greeks and the Romans left a legacy in Europe which is evident in European languages, [[Western philosophy|thought]], visual arts and law. Ancient Greece was a collection of city-states, out of which the original form of democracy developed. [[Classical Athens|Athens]] was the most powerful and developed city, and a cradle of learning from the time of [[Pericles]]. Citizens' forums debated and legislated policy of the state, and from here arose some of the most notable classical philosophers, such as [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]], the last of whom taught [[Alexander the Great]].\n\nThrough his military campaigns, the king of the kingdom of [[Macedon]], Alexander, spread Hellenistic culture and learning to the banks of the [[River Indus]]. Meanwhile, the [[Roman Republic]] strengthened through victory over [[Carthage]] in the [[Punic Wars]]. Greek wisdom passed into Roman institutions, as Athens itself was absorbed under the banner of the Senate and People of Rome \u2013 [[Senatus Populusque Romanus|SPQR]].\n\n[[File:Europe-In-301BC.png|thumb|Europe in the year 301 BC|left]]\n\nThe Romans expanded their domains from Anatolia in the east to Britannia in the west. In 44 BC as it approached its height, its dictator [[Julius Caesar]] was [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|murdered]] by senators in an attempt to restore the Republic. In the ensuing turmoil, [[Octavian]] (ruled as Augustus; and as ''divi filius'', or Son of God, as Julius had adopted him as an heir) usurped the reins of power and fought the Roman Senate. While proclaiming the rebirth of the Republic, he had ushered in the transfer of the Roman state from a republic to an empire, the [[Roman Empire]], which lasted for more than four centuries until the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]].\n\n====Ancient Greece====\n{{Main|Ancient Greece|Hellenistic period}}\n[[File:Napoli BW 2013-05-16 16-24-01.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Alexander Mosaic|mosaic]] showing [[Alexander the Great]] battling [[Darius III]]]]\n\nThe [[Hellenic civilisation]] was a collection of city-states or [[poleis]] with different governments and cultures that achieved notable developments in government, philosophy, science, mathematics, politics, sports, theatre and music.\n\nThe most powerful city-states were [[Ancient Athens|Athens]], [[History of Sparta|Sparta]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], and [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]. Athens was a powerful Hellenic city-state and governed itself with an early form of [[direct democracy]] invented by [[Cleisthenes]]; the citizens of Athens voted on legislation and executive bills themselves. Athens was the home of [[Socrates]],<ref>{{cite EB1911 |first=Henry |last=Jackson|wstitle=Socrates |volume=25 |page=331}}</ref> [[Plato]], and the [[Platonic Academy]].\n\nThe Hellenic city-states established colonies on the shores of the [[Black Sea]] and the Mediterranean ([[Asian Minor]], Sicily and Southern Italy in [[Magna Graecia]]). By the late 6th century BC, all the Greek [[city states]] in Asia Minor had been incorporated into the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], while the latter had made territorial gains in the [[Balkans]] (such as [[Macedon]], [[Thracians|Thrace]], [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonia]], etc.) and [[Eastern Europe]] proper as well. In the course of the 5th century BC, some of the Greek city states attempted to overthrow Persian rule in the [[Ionian Revolt]], which failed. This sparked the [[First Persian invasion of Greece|first Persian invasion of mainland Greece]]. At some point during the ensuing [[Greco-Persian Wars]], namely during the [[Second Persian invasion of Greece]], and precisely after the [[Battle of Thermopylae]] and the [[Battle of Artemisium]], almost all of Greece to the north of the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] had been overrun by the Persians,<ref name=\"Warfare in the Ancient World\">Brian Todd Carey, Joshua Allfree, John Cairns (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=3OSfBwAAQBAJ&pg=PT32 ''Warfare in the Ancient World''] Pen and Sword, {{ISBN|1-84884-630-4}}</ref> but the Greek city states reached a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Plataea]]. With the end of the Greco-Persian wars, the Persians were eventually decisively forced to withdraw from their territories in Europe. The Greco-Persian Wars and the victory of the Greek [[city states]] directly influenced the entire further course of European history and would set its further tone. Some Greek city-states formed the [[Delian League]] to continue fighting Persia, but Athens' position as leader of this league led Sparta to form the rival [[Peloponnesian League]]. The [[Peloponnesian War]]s ensued, and the Peloponnesian League was victorious. Subsequently, discontent with [[Spartan hegemony]] led to the [[Corinthian War]] and the defeat of Sparta at the [[Battle of Leuctra]]. At the same time at the north ruled the Thracian [[Odrysian Kingdom]] between the 5th century BC and the 1st century AD.\n\nHellenic infighting left Greek city states vulnerable, and [[Philip II of Macedon]] united the Greek city states under his control. The son of Philip II, known as [[Alexander the Great]], invaded neighboring [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]], toppled and incorporated its domains, as well as invading Egypt and going as far off as [[India]], increasing contact with people and cultures in these regions that marked the beginning of the [[Hellenistic period]].\n\nAfter the death of Alexander, his empire split into multiple kingdoms ruled by his generals, the [[Diadochi]]. The Diadochi fought against each other in a series of conflicts called the [[Wars of the Diadochi]]. In the beginning of the 2nd century BC, only three major kingdoms remained: the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Egypt]], the [[Seleucid Empire]] and [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]]. These kingdoms spread Greek culture to regions as far away as [[Bactria]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://explorethemed.com/Diadochi.asp?c=1 |title=The Diadochi and the Hellenistic Age |work=Historical Atlas of the Mediterranean |accessdate=2018-08-23 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cesare prima Gallia 58 a.C. jpg.jpg|thumb|The [[Roman republic]] and its neighbours in 58 BC.]]\n\n===Ancient Rome===\n====The rise of Rome====\n{{Main|Ancient Rome|Roman Republic|Roman Empire}}\n[[File:Cicer\u00f3n denuncia a Catilina, por Cesare Maccari.jpg|thumb|[[Cicero]] addresses the [[Roman Senate]] to denounce [[Catiline]]'s conspiracy to overthrow the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], by [[Cesare Maccari]]]]\n\nMuch of Greek learning was assimilated by the nascent Roman state as it expanded outward from Italy, taking advantage of its enemies' inability to unite: the only challenge to Roman ascent came from the [[Phoenicia]]n colony of [[Carthage]], and its defeats in the three [[Punic Wars]] marked the start of Roman [[hegemony]]. First governed by [[Roman kings|kings]], then as a senatorial republic (the [[Roman Republic]]), Rome finally became an empire at the end of the 1st century BC, under [[Augustus]] and his [[authoritarian]] successors.\n\n[[File:Europe-In-117AD.png|thumb|The Roman Empire at its greatest extent in 117 AD, under the emperor [[Trajan]]]]\n\nThe [[Roman Empire]] had its centre in the Mediterranean, controlling all the countries on its shores; the northern border was marked by the [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]] rivers. Under emperor [[Trajan]] (2nd century AD) the empire reached its maximum expansion, controlling approximately {{convert|5900000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of land surface, including [[Italian Peninsula|Italia]], [[Gaul|Gallia]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Aquitania]], [[Roman Britain|Britannia]], [[Baetica]], [[Hispania romana|Hispania]], [[Odrysian kingdom|Thrace]], [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]], [[Greece]], [[Moesia]], [[Dacia (Roman province)|Dacia]], [[Pannonia]], [[Egypt]], [[Minor Asia]], [[Cappadocia]], [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]], [[Caucasus]], [[North Africa]], [[Levant]] and parts of [[Mesopotamia]]. [[Pax Romana]], a period of peace, [[Roman civilisation|civilisation]] and an efficient [[centralised government]] in the subject territories ended in the 3rd century, when a [[Crisis of the Third Century|series of civil wars]] undermined Rome's economic and social strength.\n\nIn the 4th century, the emperors [[Diocletian]] and [[Constantine I of the Roman Empire|Constantine]] were able to slow down the process of decline by splitting the empire into a Western part with a capital in Rome and an Eastern part with the capital in Byzantium, or [[Constantinople]] (now Istanbul). Whereas Diocletian severely persecuted Christianity, Constantine declared an official end to state-sponsored [[persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|persecution of Christians]] in 313 with the [[Edict of Milan]], thus setting the stage for the [[Christian Church|Church]] to become the [[state church of the Roman Empire]] in about 380.\n\n====Decline of the Roman Empire====\n{{Main|Decline of the Roman Empire|Crisis of the Third Century}}\n[[File:Partition of the Roman Empire in 395 AD.png|thumb|left|Map of the partition of the Roman Empire in 395, at the death of [[Theodosius I]]: the [[Western Roman Empire]] is shown in red and the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire)]] is shown in purple]]\n\nThe Roman Empire had been repeatedly attacked by invading armies from Northern Europe and in 476, Rome finally fell. [[Romulus Augustus]], the last [[Roman emperor|Emperor]] of the [[Western Roman Empire]], surrendered to the Germanic King [[Odoacer]]. The British historian [[Edward Gibbon]] argued in ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (1776) that the Romans had become decadent and had lost civic virtue.\n\nGibbon said that the adoption of Christianity meant belief in a better life after death, and therefore made people lazy and indifferent to the present. \"From the eighteenth century onward\", Glen W. Bowersock has remarked,<ref>Bowersock, \"The Vanishing Paradigm of the Fall of Rome\" ''Bulletin of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences'' '''49'''.8 (May 1996:29\u201343) p. 31.</ref> \"we have been obsessed with the fall: it has been valued as an archetype for every perceived decline, and, hence, as a symbol for our own fears.\" It remains one of the greatest historical questions, and has a tradition rich in scholarly interest.\n\nSome other notable dates are the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378, the death of [[Theodosius I]] in 395 (the last time the Roman Empire was politically unified), the crossing of the [[Rhine]] in 406 by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] after the withdrawal of the legions to defend Italy against [[Alaric I]], the death of [[Stilicho]] in 408, followed by the disintegration of the western legions, the death of [[Justinian I]], the last Roman Emperor who tried to reconquer the west, in 565, and the coming of Islam after 632. Many scholars maintain that rather than a \"fall\", the changes can more accurately be described as a complex transformation.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures |volume=A: To 1500 |author=Hunt, Lynn |author2=Thomas R.

See also the [[:File:World 820.png|map of the world in 820 AD]].]]\n\nWhen Emperor Constantine had reconquered Rome under the banner of the [[Christian cross|cross]] in 312, he soon afterwards issued the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313 (preceded by the [[Edict of Serdica]] in 311), declaring the legality of Christianity in the Roman Empire. In addition, Constantine officially shifted the capital of the Roman Empire from Rome to the Greek town of Byzantium, which he renamed Nova Roma \u2013 it was later named Constantinople (\"City of Constantine\").\n\nIn 395 [[Theodosius I]], who had made Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire, would be the last emperor to preside over a united Roman Empire. The empire was split into two halves: the [[Western Roman Empire]] centred in [[Ravenna]], and the Eastern Roman Empire (later to be referred to as the [[Byzantine Empire]]) centred in Constantinople. The Roman Empire was repeatedly attacked by [[Huns|Hunnic]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], [[Slavic people|Slavic]] and other \u201cbarbarian\u201d tribes (see: [[Migration Period]]), and in 476 finally the [[Western Roman Empire|Western part]] fell to the [[Heruli]] chieftain [[Odoacer]].\n\n[[File:Europa in 526.png|thumb|left|Map showing Europe in 526 AD with the three dominating powers of the west]]\n\nRoman authority in the Western part of the empire had collapsed, and a power vacuum left in the wake of this collapse; the central organization, institutions, laws and power of Rome had broken down, resulting in many areas being open to invasion by migrating tribes. Over time, [[feudalism]] and [[manorialism]] arose, two interlocking institutions that provided for division of land and labor, as well as a broad if uneven hierarchy of law and protection. These localised hierarchies were based on the bond of common people to the land on which they worked, and to a lord, who would provide and administer both local law to settle disputes among the peasants, as well as protection from outside invaders. Unlike under Roman rule, with its standard laws and military across the empire and its great bureaucracy to administer them and collect taxes, each lord (although having obligations to a higher lord) was largely sovereign in his domain. A peasant's lot could vary greatly depending on the leadership skills and attitudes to justice of the lord toward his people. [[Tithe]]s or rents were paid to the lord, who in turn owed resources, and armed men in times of war, to his lord, perhaps a regional prince. However, the levels of hierarchy were varied over time and place.\n\nThe western provinces soon were to be dominated by three great powers: first, the [[Franks]] ([[Merovingian dynasty]]) in [[Francia]] 481\u2013843 AD, which covered much of present France and Germany; second, the [[Visigothic kingdom]] 418\u2013711 AD in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] (modern Spain); and third, the [[Ostrogothic kingdom]] 493\u2013553 AD in [[Italy]] and parts of the western [[Balkans]] The Ostrogoths were later replaced by the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]] 568\u2013774 AD. These new powers of the west built upon the Roman traditions until they evolved into a synthesis of Roman and Germanic cultures. Although these powers covered large territories, they did not have the great resources and bureaucracy of the Roman empire to control regions and localities. The ongoing invasions and boundary disputes usually meant a more risky and varying life than that under the empire. This meant that in general more power and responsibilities were left to local lords. On the other hand, it also meant more freedom, particularly in more remote areas.\n\nIn Italy, [[Theodoric the Great]] began the cultural romanization of the new world he had constructed. He made [[Ravenna]] a center of Romano-Greek culture of art and his court fostered a flowering of literature and philosophy in [[Latin]]. In Iberia, [[Chindasuinth|King Chindasuinth]] created the [[Visigothic Code]].\n<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=History of Theology: The Middle Ages|author1=Di Berardino, A.|author2=D'Onofrio, G.|author3=Studer, B.|date=2008|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=978-0-8146-5916-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2o5V2GWlaFIC|page=26|accessdate=18 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the Eastern part the dominant state was the remaining [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]].\n\nIn the feudal system, new princes and kings arose, the most powerful of which was arguably the Frankish ruler [[Charlemagne]]. In 800, Charlemagne, reinforced by his massive territorial conquests, was crowned Emperor of the Romans (Imperator Romanorum) by [[Pope Leo III]], effectively solidifying his power in western Europe. Charlemagne's reign marked the beginning of a new Germanic Roman Empire in the west, the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Outside his borders, new forces were gathering. The [[Kievan Rus']] were marking out their territory, a [[Great Moravia]] was growing, while the [[Angles]] and the [[Saxons]] were securing their borders.\n\nFor the duration of the 6th century, the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] was embroiled in a series of deadly conflicts, first with the Persian [[Sassanid Empire]] (see [[Roman\u2013Persian Wars]]), followed by the onslaught of the arising Islamic [[Caliphate]] ([[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun]] and [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]]). By 650, the provinces of [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Palestine and Syria]] were lost to the [[Rashidun army|Muslim forces]], followed by [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Hispania]] and [[History of Islam in southern Italy|southern Italy]] in the 7th and 8th centuries (see [[Muslim conquests]]).

Some date the beginnings of the Empire to the reign of [[Theodosius I]] (379\u2013395) and Christianity's official supplanting of the pagan [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]], or following his death in 395, when the empire was split into two parts, with capitals in Rome and Constantinople. Others place it yet later in 476, when [[Romulus Augustulus]], traditionally considered the last western Emperor, was deposed, thus leaving sole imperial authority with the emperor in the [[Greek East]]. Others point to the reorganisation of the empire in the time of [[Heraclius]] (c. 620) when Latin titles and usages were officially replaced with Greek versions. In any case, the changeover was gradual and by 330, when Constantine inaugurated his new capital, the process of hellenization and increasing [[Christianisation]] was already under way. The Empire is generally considered to have ended after the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in 1453. The [[Plague of Justinian]] was a [[pandemic]] that afflicted the [[Byzantine Empire]], including its capital [[Constantinople]], in the years 541\u2013542.

They landed at [[Gibraltar]] on 30 April and worked their way northward. Tariq's forces were joined the next year by those of his Arab superior, [[Musa ibn Nusair]]. During the eight-year campaign most of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] was brought under Muslim rule \u2013 save for small areas in the northwest ([[Asturias]]) and largely [[Basque people|Basque]] regions in the [[Pyrenees]]. In 711, [[Visigothic]] [[Hispania]] was very weakened because it was immersed in a serious internal crisis caused by a war of succession to the throne involving two Visigoth suitors. The Muslims took advantage of the crisis within the [[Hispania|Hispano]]-[[Visigothic]] society to carry out their conquests. This territory, under the Arab name [[Al-Andalus]], became part of the expanding [[Umayyad]] empire.\n\nThe [[Siege of Constantinople (717\u2013718)|second siege of Constantinople]] (717) ended unsuccessful after the intervention of [[Tervel of Bulgaria]] and weakened the [[Umayyad|Umayyad dynasty]] and reduced their prestige. In 722 [[Don Pelayo]], a [[nobleman]] of Visigothic origin, formed an army of 300 [[Astures|Astur]] soldiers, to confront Munuza's Muslim troops. In the [[battle of Covadonga]], the Astures defeated the Arab-Moors, who decided to retire. The Christian victory marked the beginning of the [[Reconquista]] and the establishment of the [[Kingdom of Asturias]], whose first sovereign was Don Pelayo. The conquerors intended to continue their expansion in Europe and move northeast across the Pyrenees, but were defeated by the [[Frankish Empire|Frankish]] leader [[Charles Martel]] at the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] in 732. The Umayyads were overthrown in 750 by the '[[Abb\u0101sids]],<ref>Joseph F.

His empire based in modern France, the [[Low Countries]] and Germany expanded into modern Hungary, Italy, [[Bohemia]], Lower Saxony and Spain. He and his father received substantial help from an alliance with the Pope, who wanted help against the [[Lombards]].<ref>Michael Frassetto, ''Early Medieval World, The: From the Fall of Rome to the Time of Charlemagne'' (2013)</ref>\n\nTo the east, [[Bulgaria]] was established in 681 and became the first [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] country. The powerful [[Bulgarian Empire]] was the main rival of Byzantium for control of the [[Balkans]] for centuries and from the 9th century became the cultural centre of Slavic Europe. The [[First Bulgarian Empire|Empire]] created the [[Cyrillic script]] during the 9th century AD, at the [[Preslav Literary School]], and experienced the [[Golden Age of medieval Bulgarian culture|Golden Age]] of Bulgarian cultural prosperity during the reign of emperor [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I the Great]] (893\u2013927). Two states, [[Great Moravia]] and [[Kievan Rus']], emerged among the Slavic peoples respectively in the 9th century. In the late 9th and 10th centuries, northern and western Europe felt the burgeoning power and influence of the [[Viking]]s who raided, traded, conquered and settled swiftly and efficiently with their advanced seagoing vessels such as the [[longship]]s. The [[Invasion#Magyar invasions of Europe|Hungarians]] pillaged mainland Europe, the [[Pechenegs]] raided Bulgaria, Rus States and the [[Arab]] states. In the 10th century independent kingdoms were established in Central Europe including Poland and the newly settled [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Croatia (925\u20131102)|Croatia]] and [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbia]] also appeared in the [[Balkans]]. The subsequent period, ending around 1000, saw the further growth of [[feudalism]], which weakened the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nIn eastern Europe, [[Volga Bulgaria]] became an Islamic state in 921, after [[Alm\u0131\u015f I]] converted to Islam under the missionary efforts of [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]].<ref>Gerald Mako, \"The Islamization of the Volga Bulghars: A Question Reconsidered\", Archivum Eurasiae Medii Aevi 18, 2011, 199\u2013223.</ref>\n\nSlavery in the early medieval period had mostly died out in western Europe by about the year 1000 AD, replaced by [[serfdom]]. It lingered longer in England and in peripheral areas linked to the Muslim world, where slavery continued to flourish. Church rules suppressed slavery of Christians. Most historians argue the transition was quite abrupt around 1000, but some see a gradual transition from about 300 to 1000.<ref>Seymour Drescher and Stanley L. Engerman, eds.

In 1054, the [[East\u2013West Schism]], an insoluble split, occurred between the two remaining Christian seats in [[Catholic Church|Rome]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Constantinople]] (modern Istanbul).\n\nThe High Middle Ages of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries show a [[Medieval demography|rapidly increasing population]] of Europe, which caused great social and political change from the preceding era. By 1250, the robust population increase greatly benefited the economy, reaching levels it would not see again in some areas until the 19th century.<ref>John H. Mundy, ''Europe in the high Middle Ages, 1150\u20131309'' (1973) [https://archive.org/details/europeinhighmidd00mund online]</ref>\n\nFrom about the year 1000 onwards, Western Europe saw the last of the barbarian invasions and became more politically organized. The [[Viking]]s had settled in Britain, Ireland, France and elsewhere, whilst Norse Christian kingdoms were developing in their Scandinavian homelands. The [[Hungarian people|Magyars]] had ceased their expansion in the 10th century, and by the year 1000, the Roman Catholic [[Apostolic Kingdom]] of Hungary was recognised in central Europe. With the brief exception of the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongol invasions]], major barbarian incursions ceased.\n\n[[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] sovereignty was reestablished with the [[Uprising of Asen and Peter|anti-Byzantine uprising of the Bulgarians and Vlachs]] in 1185. The crusaders invaded the [[Byzantine empire]], captured Constantinople in 1204 and established their [[Latin Empire]]. [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria]] defeated [[Baldwin I, Latin Emperor|Baldwin I]], [[Latin emperor of Constantinople]], in the [[Battle of Adrianople (1205)|Battle of Adrianople]] on 14 April 1205. The reign of [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria]] led to maximum territorial expansion and that of [[Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria]] to a [[Architecture of the Tarnovo Artistic School|Second Golden Age of Bulgarian culture]]. The Byzantine Empire was fully reestablished in 1261.\n\nIn the 11th century, populations north of the [[Alps]] began to settle new lands, some of which had reverted to wilderness after the end of the [[Roman Empire]]. In what is known as the \"great clearances\", vast forests and marshes of Europe were cleared and cultivated. At the same time settlements moved beyond the traditional boundaries of the [[Frankish Empire]] to new frontiers in Europe, beyond the [[Elbe]] river, tripling the size of Germany in the process. Crusaders founded [[Crusader states|European colonies]] in the [[Levant]], the majority of the [[Reconquista|Iberian Peninsula was conquered]] from the Muslims, and the [[Normans]] colonised southern Italy, all part of the major population increase and resettlement pattern.\n\nThe High Middle Ages produced many different forms of intellectual, spiritual and [[Medieval art|artistic works]]. The most famous are the great cathedrals as expressions of [[Gothic architecture]], which evolved from [[Romanesque architecture]]. This age saw the rise of modern nation-states in Western Europe and the ascent of the famous Italian [[city-state]]s, such as [[Florence]] and [[Venice]]. The influential popes of the Catholic Church called volunteer armies from across Europe to a series of [[Crusades]] against the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq Turks]], who occupied the [[Holy Land]]. The rediscovery of the works of [[Aristotle]] led [[Thomas Aquinas]] and other thinkers to develop the philosophy of [[Scholasticism]].\n\n====A divided church====\n{{Main|East\u2013West Schism}}\n\nThe Great Schism between the Western (Catholic) and Eastern (Orthodox) Christian Churches was sparked in 1054 by [[Pope Leo IX]] asserting authority over three of the seats in the [[Pentarchy]], in Antioch, Jerusalem and Alexandria. Since the mid-8th century, the Byzantine Empire's borders had been shrinking in the face of Islamic expansion. [[Antioch]] had been wrested back into Byzantine control by 1045, but the resurgent power of the Roman successors in the West claimed a right and a duty for the lost seats in Asia and Africa. Pope Leo sparked a further dispute by defending the [[filioque]] clause in the [[Nicene Creed]] which the West had adopted customarily. The Orthodox today state that the XXVIIIth Canon of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] explicitly proclaimed the equality of the Bishops of Rome and Constantinople. The Orthodox also state that the Bishop of Rome has authority only over his own diocese and does not have any authority outside his diocese. There were other less significant catalysts for the Schism however, including variance over [[liturgy]]. The Schism of Roman Catholic and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] followed centuries of estrangement between the Latin and Greek worlds.\n\n====Holy wars====\n{{Main|Crusades|Reconquista}}\n[[File:SiegeofAntioch.jpeg|thumb|The [[Siege of Antioch]], from a medieval miniature painting, during the [[First Crusade]]]]\n\nAfter the [[East\u2013West Schism]], [[Western Christianity]] was adopted by the newly created kingdoms of Central Europe: [[Poland]], Hungary and [[Bohemia]]. The Roman Catholic Church developed as a major power, leading to conflicts between the Pope and Emperor. The geographic reach of the Roman Catholic Church expanded enormously due to the conversions of pagan kings (Scandinavia, [[Lithuania]], Poland, Hungary), the Christian [[Reconquista]] of [[Al-Andalus]], and the [[crusades]]. Most of Europe was Roman Catholic in the 15th century.\n\nEarly signs of the rebirth of civilization in western Europe began to appear in the 11th century as trade started again in Italy, leading to the economic and cultural growth of independent [[city-state]]s such as [[Venice#History|Venice]] and [[History of Florence|Florence]]; at the same time, nation-states began to take form in places such as France, England, Spain, and Portugal, although the process of their formation (usually marked by rivalry between the monarchy, the aristocratic feudal lords and the church) actually took several centuries. These new nation-states began writing in their own cultural vernaculars, instead of the traditional [[Latin]]. Notable figures of this movement would include [[Dante Alighieri]] and [[Christine de Pizan]] (born Christina da Pizzano), the former writing in Italian, and the latter, although an Italian (Venice), relocated to France, writing in French. (See [[Reconquista]] for the latter two countries.) Elsewhere, the [[Holy Roman Empire]], essentially based in Germany and Italy, further fragmented into a myriad of feudal principalities or small city states, whose subjection to the emperor was only formal.\n\nThe 14th century, when the [[Mongol Empire]] came to power, is often called the ''Age of the Mongols''. Mongol armies expanded westward under the command of [[Batu Khan]]. Their western conquests included almost all of Russia (save [[Novgorod]], which became a vassal),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/citd/RussianHeritage/4.PEAS/4.L/12.III.5.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20110427075859/https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/citd/RussianHeritage/4.PEAS/4.L/12.III.5.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 April 2011 |title=The Destruction of Kiev |publisher=Tspace.library.utoronto.ca |accessdate=17 May 2012 }}</ref> the [[Kipchak-Cuman Confederation]].

The [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword|Livonian Brothers]] of the Sword were defeated by the Lithuanians, so in 1237 Gregory IX merged the remainder of the order into the Teutonic Order as the [[Livonian Order]]. By the middle of the century, the Teutonic Knights completed their conquest of the Prussians before conquering and converting the Lithuanians in the subsequent decades. The order also came into conflict with the Eastern Orthodox Church of the [[Pskov Republic|Pskov]] and [[Novgorod Republic]]s. In 1240 the Orthodox Novgorod army defeated the Catholic Swedes in the [[Battle of the Neva]], and, two years later, they defeated the Livonian Order in the [[Battle on the Ice]]. The [[Union of Krewo]] in 1386, bringing two major changes in the history of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania: [[Christianization of Lithuania|conversion to Catholicism]] and establishment of a [[dynastic union]] between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]] marked both the greatest territorial expansion of the Grand Duchy and the defeat of the Teutonic Knights in the [[Battle of Grunwald]] in 1410.\n\n===Late Middle Ages===\n{{Main|Late Middle Ages|Lex mercatoria|Hundred Years' War|Fall of Constantinople}}\n[[File:Bubonic plague-en.svg|thumb|right|The spread of the \"Black Death\" from 1347 to 1351 through Europe]]\n\nThe Late Middle Ages spanned the 14th and early 15th centuries.<ref>Wallace K.

A series of famines and plagues, such as the [[Great Famine of 1315\u20131317]] and the [[Black Death]], killed people in a matter of days, reducing the population of some areas by half as many survivors fled. Kishlansky reports:\n:The Black Death touched every aspect of life, hastening a process of social, economic, and cultural transformation already underway.... Fields were abandoned, workplaces stood idle, international trade was suspended. Traditional bonds of kinship, village, and even religion were broken amid the horrors of death, flight, and failed expectations. \"People cared no more for dead men than we care for dead goats,\" wrote one survivor.<ref>Mark Kishlansky et al. ''Civilization in the West: Volume 1 to 1715'' (5th ed. 2003) p. 316</ref>\n\nDepopulation caused labor to become scarcer; the survivors were better paid and peasants could drop some of the burdens of feudalism. There was also social unrest; France and England experienced serious peasant risings including the [[Jacquerie]] and the [[Peasants' Revolt]]. At the same time, the unity of the Catholic Church was shattered by the [[Western Schism|Great Schism]]. Collectively these events have been called the [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages]].<ref>Cantor, p. 480.</ref>\n\nBeginning in the 14th century, the [[Baltic Sea]] became one of the most important [[trade route]]s. The [[Hanseatic League]], an alliance of trading cities, facilitated the absorption of vast areas of Poland, [[Lithuania]], and [[Terra Mariana|Livonia]] into trade with other European countries. This fed the growth of powerful states in this part of Europe including Poland-Lithuania, Hungary, Bohemia, and Muscovy later on. The conventional end of the [[Middle Ages]] is usually associated with the fall of the city of [[Constantinople]] and of the [[Byzantine Empire]] to the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1453. The Turks made the city the capital of their [[Ottoman Empire]], which lasted until 1922 and included [[Egypt]], Syria, and most of the [[Balkans]]. The [[Ottoman wars in Europe]], also sometimes referred to as the Turkish wars, marked an essential part of the history of the continent as a whole.\n\n====Homicide rates plunge over 800 years====\nAt the local level, levels of violence were extremely high by modern standards in medieval and early modern Europe. Typically, small groups would battle their neighbors, using the farm tools at hand such as knives, sickles, hammers and axes. Mayhem and death were deliberate. The vast majority of people lived in rural areas. Cities were few, and small in size, but their concentration of population was conducive to violence. Long-term studies of places such as Amsterdam, Stockholm, Venice and Zurich show the same trends as rural areas. Across Europe, [[homicide]] trends (not including military actions) show a steady long-term decline.<ref>Manuel Eisner, \"Long-term historical trends in violent crime.\" ''Crime and Justice'' 30 (2003): 83\u2013142.

From approximately 1200 AD through 1800 AD, homicide rates from violent local episodes declined by a factor of ten, from approximately 32 deaths per 1000 people to 3.2 per 1000. In the 20th century the homicide rate fell to 1.4 per 1000. Police forces seldom existed outside the cities; prisons only became common after 1800. Before then harsh penalties were imposed for homicide (severe whipping or execution) but they proved ineffective at controlling or reducing the insults to honor that precipitated most of the violence. The decline does not correlate with economics. Most historians attribute the trend in homicides to a steady increase in self-control of the sort promoted by Protestantism, and necessitated by schools and factories.<ref>Eisner, pp 127\u201332.</ref><ref>Helmut Thome, \"Explaining long term trends in violent crime.\" ''Crime, Histoire & Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s/Crime, History & Societies'' 5.2 (2001): 69\u201386 [https://journals.openedition.org/chs/738 online]</ref><ref>On the growing role of local government in reducing local feuds see Matthew H.

The period is characterised by the rise to importance of science and increasingly rapid [[History of technology|technological progress]], secularised civic politics and the [[nation state]]. [[capitalist economy|Capitalist economies]] began their rise. The early modern period also saw the rise and dominance of the economic theory of [[mercantilism]]. As such, the early modern period represents the decline and eventual disappearance, in much of the European sphere, of [[feudalism]], serfdom and the power of the Catholic Church. The period includes the [[Renaissance]], the [[Protestant Reformation]], the disastrous [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[European colonisation of the Americas]] and the [[European witch-hunts]].\n\n===Renaissance===\n{{Main|Renaissance}}\n[[File:Pacioli.jpg|250px|thumb|upright|''[[Portrait of Luca Pacioli]]'', the founder of accounting, by [[Jacopo de' Barbari]] ([[Museo di Capodimonte]]).]]\n\nDespite these crises, the 14th century was also a time of great progress within the arts and sciences. A renewed interest in ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] led to what has later been termed the [[Italian Renaissance]].\n\nThe Renaissance was a cultural movement that profoundly affected European intellectual life in the [[early modern period]]. Beginning in Italy, and spreading to the north, west and [[middle Europe]] during a cultural lag of some two and a half centuries, its influence affected literature, philosophy, art, politics, science, history, religion, and other aspects of intellectual enquiry.\n\nThe Italian [[Petrarch]] (Francesco di Petracco), deemed the first full-blooded Humanist, wrote in the 1330s: \"I am alive now, yet I would rather have been born in another time.\" He was enthusiastic about Greek and Roman antiquity. In the 15th and 16th centuries the continuing enthusiasm for the ancients was reinforced by the feeling that the inherited culture was dissolving and here was a storehouse of ideas and attitudes with which to rebuild. [[Matteo Palmieri]] wrote in the 1430s: \"Now indeed may every thoughtful spirit thank god that it has been permitted to him to be born in a new age.\" The renaissance was born: a new age where learning was very important.\n\nThe Renaissance was inspired by the growth in study of Latin and Greek texts and the admiration of the Greco-Roman era as a golden age. This prompted many artists and writers to begin drawing from Roman and Greek examples for their works, but there was also much innovation in this period, especially by multi-faceted artists such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. The Humanists saw their repossession of a great past as a Renaissance \u2013 a rebirth of civilization itself.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert A.

[[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]]'s political writing in ''[[The Prince]]'' influenced later absolutism and real-politik. Also important were the many patrons who ruled states and used the artistry of the Renaissance as a sign of their power.\n\nIn all, the Renaissance could be viewed as an attempt by intellectuals to study and improve the secular and worldly, both through the revival of ideas from antiquity, and through novel approaches to thought \u2013 the immediate past being too \"Gothic\" in language, thought and sensibility.\n\n===Exploration and trade===\n[[File:Lisboa-Museu_Nacional_de_Arte_Antiga-Retrato_dito_de_Vasco_da_Gama-20140917.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Vasco da Gama]] discovered the sea route from Europe to India around Africa.]]\n{{Main|Age of Discovery}}\n[[File:Cantino Planisphere.jpg|thumb|[[Cantino planisphere]], 1502, earliest chart showing explorations by [[Vasco da Gama|Gama]], [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] and [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral|Cabral]]]]\n\nToward the end of the period, an era of discovery began. The growth of the [[Ottoman Empire]], culminating in the fall of Constantinople in 1453, cut off trading possibilities with the east. Western Europe was forced to discover new trading routes, as happened with Columbus' travel to the Americas in 1492, and [[Vasco da Gama]]'s circumnavigation of [[Indian subcontinent|India]] and Africa in 1498.\n\nThe numerous wars did not prevent European states from exploring and conquering wide portions of the world, from Africa to Asia and the newly discovered Americas. In the 15th century, Portugal led the way in geographical exploration along the coast of Africa in search of a maritime route to India, followed by Spain near the close of the 15th century, dividing their exploration of the world according to the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] in 1494.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kwabs.com/tordesillas_treaty.html |title=kwabs.com |publisher= |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215021/http://www.kwabs.com/tordesillas_treaty.html |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df= }}</ref> They were the first states to set up colonies in America and European [[factory (trading post)|trading posts (factories)]] along the shores of Africa and Asia, establishing the first direct European diplomatic contacts with Southeast Asian states in 1511, China in 1513 and Japan in 1542. In 1552, Russian tsar [[Ivan the Terrible]] conquered two major [[Tatar]] khanates, the [[Khanate of Kazan]] and the [[Astrakhan Khanate]]. The [[Yermak Timofeyevich|Yermak]]'s voyage of 1580 led to the annexation of the Tatar [[Siberian Khanate]] into Russia, and the Russians would soon after conquer the rest of [[Siberia]], steadily expanding to the east and south over the next centuries.

[[Melbourne University Publishing|Melbourne University Press]].</ref> and New Zealand in 1642.\n\n===Reformation===\n{{Main|Protestant Reformation}}\n[[File:95Thesen.jpg|left|thumb|[[The Ninety-Five Theses]] of German monk [[Martin Luther]], which criticized the Catholic Church]]\n[[File:Europe map 1648.PNG|left|thumb|350px|Map of Europe in 1648]]\n\nWith the development of the [[printing press]], new ideas spread throughout Europe and challenged traditional doctrines in science and theology. Simultaneously, the [[Protestant Reformation]] under German [[Martin Luther]] questioned Papal authority. The most common dating of the Reformation begins in 1517, when Luther published ''[[The Ninety-Five Theses]]'', and concludes in 1648 with the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] that ended years of [[European wars of religion|European religious wars]].<ref>Euan Cameron, ''The European Reformation'' (1991)</ref>\n\nDuring this period corruption in the Catholic Church led to a sharp backlash in the [[Protestant Reformation]]. It gained many followers especially among princes and kings seeking a stronger state by ending the influence of the Catholic Church. Figures other than [[Martin Luther]] began to emerge as well like [[John Calvin]] whose [[Calvinism]] had influence in many countries and King [[Henry VIII of England]] who broke away from the Catholic Church in England and set up the [[Anglican Church]]; his daughter [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] finished the organization of the church. These religious divisions brought on a wave of wars inspired and driven by religion but also by the ambitious monarchs in Western Europe who were becoming more centralised and powerful.\n\nThe Protestant Reformation also led to a strong reform movement in the Catholic Church called the [[Counter-Reformation]], which aimed to reduce corruption as well as to improve and strengthen Catholic dogma. Two important groups in the Catholic Church who emerged from this movement were the [[Jesuits]], who helped keep Spain, Portugal, Poland and other European countries within the Catholic fold, and the Oratorians of [[Saint Philip Neri]], who ministered to the faithful in Rome, restoring their confidence in the Church of Jesus Christ that subsisted substantially in the Church of Rome. Still, the Catholic Church was somewhat weakened by the Reformation, portions of Europe were no longer under its sway and kings in the remaining Catholic countries began to take control of the church institutions within their kingdoms.\n\nUnlike many European countries, the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and Hungary were more tolerant. While still enforcing the predominance of Catholicism, they continued to allow the large religious minorities to maintain their faiths, traditions and customs. The Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth became divided among Catholics, Protestants, Orthodox, Jews and a small Muslim population.\n\nAnother important development in this period was the growth of pan-European sentiments. Em\u00e9ric Cruc\u00e9 (1623) came up with the idea of the [[European Council]], intended to end wars in Europe; attempts to create lasting peace were no success, although all European countries (except the Russian and Ottoman Empires, regarded as foreign) agreed to make peace in 1518 at the [[Treaty of London (1518)|Treaty of London]]. Many wars broke out again in a few years. The Reformation also made European peace impossible for many centuries.\n\n[[File:Europe As A Queen Sebastian Munster 1570.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Europa regina]], 1570 print by [[Sebastian M\u00fcnster]] of [[Basel]]]]\n\nAnother development was the idea of 'European superiority'. The ideal of civilisation was taken over from the ancient Greeks and Romans: Discipline, education and living in the city were required to make people civilised; Europeans and non-Europeans were judged for their civility, and Europe regarded itself as superior to other continents. There was a movement by some such as [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] that regarded the non-Europeans as a better, more natural and primitive people. Post services were founded all over Europe, which allowed a [[Renaissance humanism|humanistic]] interconnected network of intellectuals across Europe, despite religious divisions. However, the Roman Catholic Church banned many leading scientific works; this led to an intellectual advantage for Protestant countries, where the banning of books was regionally organised. [[Francis Bacon]] and other advocates of science tried to create unity in Europe by focusing on the unity in nature.<sup>[[#Notes|1]]</sup> In the 15th century, at the end of the Middle Ages, powerful sovereign states were appearing, built by the [[New Monarchs]] who were centralising power in France, England, and Spain. On the other hand, the Parliament in the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] grew in power, taking legislative rights from the Polish king. The new state power was contested by parliaments in other countries especially England. New kinds of states emerged which were co-operation agreements among territorial rulers, cities, farmer republics and knights.\n\n[[File:Alberico Gentili.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alberico Gentili]], the Father of international law.]]\n\n===Mercantilism and colonial expansion===\n{{Main|Mercantilism}}\n[[File:Colonisation2.gif|thumb|left|Animated map showing the evolution of [[Colonial empire]]s from 1492 to the present]]\n\nThe [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] states (Spain and Portugal) were able to dominate [[New World]] (American) colonial activity in the 16th century. The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] forged the first global empire in the 15th and 16th century, whilst during the 16th century and the first half of the 17th century, the Spanish under the crown of Castile became the most powerful global empire in the world. This dominance was increasingly challenged by [[British colonisation of the Americas|British]], [[French colonisation of the Americas|French]], and the short-lived [[New Netherland|Dutch]] and [[New Sweden|Swedish]] colonial efforts of the 17th and 18th centuries. New forms of trade and expanding horizons made new forms of [[Federalism|government]], [[Constitutionalism|law]] and economics necessary.\n\nColonial expansion continued in the following centuries (with some setbacks, such as successful wars of independence in the [[American Revolution|British American colonies]] and then later [[Haitian Revolution|Haiti]], [[Mexican War of Independence|Mexico]], [[Argentine War of Independence|Argentina]], [[Brazilian Independence|Brazil]], and [[Latin American wars of independence|others]] amid European turmoil of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]; Haiti unique in abolishing slavery). Spain had control of a large part of North America, all of Central America and a great part of South America, the Caribbean and the [[Philippines]]; Britain took the whole of Australia and New Zealand, most of India, and large parts of Africa and North America; France held parts of Canada and India (nearly all of which was lost to Britain [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|in 1763]]), [[French Indochina|Indochina]], large parts of Africa and the Caribbean islands; the Netherlands gained the [[Indies|East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]) and islands in the Caribbean; Portugal obtained Brazil and several territories in Africa and Asia; and later, powers such as Germany, Belgium, Italy and Russia acquired further colonies.\n\nThis expansion helped the economy of the countries owning them. [[Mercantilism|Trade]] flourished, because of the minor stability of the empires. By the late 16th century, American silver accounted for one-fifth of Spain's total budget.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Conquest in the Americas |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761575057_13/spain.html |work= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028035130/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761575057_13/Spain.html |archivedate=28 October 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> The European countries fought wars that were largely paid for by the money coming in from the colonies.

In addition, there were secessions and upheavals in several parts of the Spanish empire, the world's first global empire. In Britain the entire Stuart monarchy (England, Scotland, Ireland, and its North American colonies) rebelled. Political insurgency and a spate of popular revolts seldom equalled shook the foundations of most states in Europe and Asia. More wars took place around the world in the mid-17th century than in almost any other period of recorded history. The crises spread far beyond Europe \u2013 for example Ming China, the most populous state in the world, collapsed. Across the Northern Hemisphere, the mid-17th century experienced almost unprecedented death rates. Geoffrey Parker, a British historian, suggests that environmental factors may have been in part to blame, especially global cooling.<ref>Geoffrey Parker, \"Crisis and Catastrophe: The Global Crisis of the Seventeenth Century Reconsidered,\" ''American Historical Review'' (2008) 113#4 pp. 1053\u201379.</ref><ref>J.B.

The expanding colonial frontiers resulted in a [[Commercial Revolution]]. The period is noted for the rise of modern science and the application of its findings to technological improvements, which animated the [[Industrial Revolution]] after 1750.\n\nThe Reformation had profound effects on the unity of Europe. Not only were nations divided one from another by their religious orientation, but some states were torn apart internally by religious strife, avidly fostered by their external enemies. France suffered this fate in the 16th century in the series of conflicts known as the [[French Wars of Religion]], which ended in the triumph of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon Dynasty]]. England avoided this fate for a while and settled down under [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] to a moderate [[Anglicanism]]. Much of modern-day Germany was made up of numerous small sovereign states under the theoretical framework of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which was further divided along internally drawn sectarian lines. The [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] is notable in this time for its [[religious tolerance|religious indifference]] and a general immunity to the horrors of European religious strife.\n\n====Thirty Years' War 1618\u20131648====\nThe [[Thirty Years' War]] was fought between 1618 and 1648, across Germany and neighbouring areas, and involved most of the major European powers except England and Russia.<ref>Peter H. Wilson, ''Europe's Tragedy: A History of the Thirty Years War'' (2009)</ref> Beginning as a religious conflict between Protestants and Catholics in [[Bohemia]], it quickly developed into a general war involving Catholics versus Protestants for the most part. The major impact of the war, in which [[mercenary]] armies were extensively used, was the devastation of entire regions scavenged bare by the foraging armies. Episodes of widespread famine and disease, and the breakup of family life, devastated the population of the German states and, to a lesser extent, the [[Low Countries]], the [[Crown of Bohemia]] and northern parts of Italy, while bankrupting many of the regional powers involved. Between one-fourth and one-third of the German population perished from direct military causes or from disease and starvation, as well as postponed births.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 649855|title = The Economic and Social Consequences of the Thirty Years' War|journal = Past & Present|volume = 39|issue = 39|pages = 44\u201361|last1 = Kamen|first1 = Henry|year = 1968|doi = 10.1093/past/39.1.44}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Herman Moll Map of Europe.jpg|thumb|left|After the [[Peace of Westphalia]], Europe's borders were still stable in 1708]]\nAfter the [[Peace of Westphalia]], which ended the war in favour of nations deciding their own religious allegiance, [[Political absolutism|absolutism]] became the norm of the continent, while parts of Europe experimented with constitutions foreshadowed by the [[English Civil War]] and particularly the [[Glorious Revolution]]. European military conflict did not cease, but had less disruptive effects on the lives of Europeans. In the advanced northwest, [[the Enlightenment]] gave a philosophical underpinning to the new outlook, and the continued spread of literacy, made possible by the [[printing press]], created new secular forces in thought.\n\n[[File:Map of Europe in 1794 Samuel Dunn Map of the World in Hemispheres.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Map of Europe in [[1794 Samuel Dunn Map of the World in Hemispheres|1794 Samuel Dunn Map of the World]]]]\nFrom the Union of Krewo (see above) central and eastern Europe was dominated by [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. In the 16th and 17th centuries Central and Eastern Europe was an arena of conflict for domination of the continent between [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]], the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth (involved in series of wars, like [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], [[Russo-Polish War (1654\u201367)|Russo-Polish War]], the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]], etc.) and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. This period saw a gradual decline of these three powers which were eventually replaced by new enlightened absolutist monarchies: Russia, Prussia and Austria (the Habsburg Monarchy). By the turn of the 19th century they had become new powers, having [[Partitions of Poland|divided Poland]] between themselves, with Sweden and Turkey having experienced substantial territorial losses to Russia and Austria respectively as well as pauperisation.\n\n====War of the Spanish Succession====\nThe [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701\u20131715) was a major war with France opposed by a coalition of England, the Netherlands, the Habsburg Monarchy, and Prussia. [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] commanded the English and Dutch victory at the [[Battle of Blenheim]] in 1704. The main issue was whether France under King Louis XIV would take control of Spain's very extensive possessions and thereby become by far the dominant power, or be forced to share power with other major nations. After initial allied successes, the long war produced a military stalemate and ended with the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], which was based on a balance of power in Europe. Historian [[Russell Weigley]] argues that the many wars almost never accomplished more than they cost.<ref>Russell Weigley,  ''The Age of Battles: The Quest for Decisive Warfare from Breitenfeld to Waterloo'' (1991).</ref> British historian [[G. M.

Frederick had a rationale based on Enlightenment thought: he fought total wars for limited objectives.

The Enlightenment flourished until about 1790\u20131800, at which point the Enlightenment, with its emphasis on reason, gave way to [[Romanticism]], which placed a new emphasis on emotion; a [[Counter-Enlightenment]] began to increase in prominence.

Palmer]] and [[Joel Colton]] argue:\n:In 1789 France fell into revolution, and the world has never since been the same. The French Revolution was by far the most momentous upheaval of the whole revolutionary age. It replaced the \"old regime\" with \"modern society,\" and at its extreme phase became very radical, so much so that all later revolutionary movements have looked back to it as a predecessor to themselves.... From the 1760s to 1848, the role of France was decisive.<ref>R.R. Palmer and Joel Colton, A History of the Modern World (5th ed. 1978), p. 341</ref>\n\nThe era of the French Revolution and the subsequent Napoleonic wars was a difficult time for monarchs. Tsar [[Paul I of Russia]] was assassinated; King [[Louis XVI of France]] was executed, as was his queen [[Marie Antoinette]]. Furthermore, kings [[Charles IV of Spain]], [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]] and [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden]] were deposed as were ultimately the Emperor Napoleon and all of the relatives he had installed on various European thrones. King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] and Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II of Austria]] barely clung to their thrones. [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III of England]] lost the better part of his empire.<ref>Steven Englund, ''Napoleon: A Political Life'' (2004) p. 388</ref>\n\nThe [[American Revolution]] (1775\u20131783) was the first successful revolt of a colony against a European power. It proclaimed, in the words of [[Thomas Jefferson]], that \"all men are created equal,\" a position based on the principles of the Enlightenment. It rejected aristocracy and established a [[Republicanism|republican form of government]] under [[George Washington]] that attracted worldwide attention.<ref>Gordon S. Wood, ''The radicalism of the American Revolution'' (2011).</ref>\n\nThe French Revolution (1789\u20131804) was a product of the same democratic forces in the [[Atlantic World]] and had an even greater impact.<ref>R.R.

The French Revolution differed from other revolutions in being not merely national, for it aimed at benefiting all humanity.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=A.

After repeated failed attempts at financial reform, King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] had to convene the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]], a representative body of the country made up of three estates: the clergy, the nobility, and the commoners. The third estate, joined by members of the other two, declared itself to be a [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] and swore an [[Tennis Court Oath|oath]] not to dissolve until France had a constitution and created, in July, the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]]. At the same time the people of Paris revolted, famously storming the [[Bastille]] prison on 14 July 1789.\n\nAt the time the assembly wanted to create a [[constitutional monarchy]], and over the following two years passed various laws including the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], the [[Abolition of feudalism in France|abolition of feudalism]], and a [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy|fundamental change]] in the relationship between France and Rome. At first the king agreed with these changes and enjoyed reasonable popularity with the people. As anti-royalism increased along with threat of foreign invasion, the king tried to flee and join France's enemies. He was captured and on 21 January 1793, having been convicted of treason, he was guillotined.\n\nOn 20 September 1792 the [[National Convention]] abolished the monarchy and declared France a republic. Due to the emergency of [[French Revolutionary Wars|war]], the National Convention created the [[Committee of Public Safety]], controlled by [[Maximilien de Robespierre]] of the [[Jacobin Club]], to act as the country's executive. Under Robespierre, the committee initiated the [[Reign of Terror]], during which up to 40,000 people were executed in Paris, mainly nobles and those convicted by the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]], often on the flimsiest of evidence. Internal tensions at Paris drove the Committee towards increasing assertions of radicalism and increasing suspicions, fueling new terror: A few months into this phase, more and more prominent revolutionaries were being sent to the guillotine by Robespierre and his faction, for example [[Madame Roland]] and [[Georges Danton]]. Elsewhere in the country, counter-revolutionary [[war in the Vend\u00e9e|insurrections]] were brutally suppressed. The regime was overthrown in the [[Thermidorian Reaction|coup of 9 Thermidor]] (27 July 1794) and Robespierre was executed. The regime which followed ended the Terror and relaxed Robespierre's more extreme policies.\n\n[[File:Battle of Waterloo 1815.PNG|left|thumb|''[[The Battle of Waterloo (painting)|The Battle of Waterloo]]'', where [[Napoleon]] was defeated by the Seventh Coalition in 1815]]\n\n===Napoleon===\n[[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] was one of the world's most famous soldiers and statesmen, leading France to great victories over numerous European enemies. Despite modest origins he became Emperor and restructured much of European diplomacy, politics and law, until he was forced to abdicate in 1814. His 100-day comeback in 1815 failed at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], and he died in exile on a remote island, remembered as a great hero by many Frenchmen and as a great villain by British and other enemies.\n\nNapoleon, despite his youth, was France's most successful general in the Revolutionary wars, having conquered large parts of [[Italy]] and forced the Austrians to sue for peace. In 1799 on [[18 Brumaire]] (9 November) he overthrew the feeble government, replacing it with the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], which he dominated. He gained popularity in France by restoring the Church, keeping taxes low, centralizing power in Paris, and winning glory on the battlefield. In 1804 he crowned himself [[First French Empire|Emperor]]. In 1805, Napoleon planned to invade Britain, but a renewed British alliance with Russia and Austria ([[Third Coalition]]), forced him to turn his attention towards the continent, while at the same time the French fleet was demolished by the British at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], ending any plan to invade Britain. On 2 December 1805, Napoleon defeated a numerically superior Austro-Russian army at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], forcing Austria's withdrawal from the coalition (see [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]]) and dissolving the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. In 1806, a [[Fourth Coalition]] was set up. On 14 October Napoleon defeated the Prussians at the [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt]], marched through Germany and defeated the Russians on 14 June 1807 at [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]]. The [[Treaties of Tilsit]] divided Europe between France and Russia and created the [[Duchy of Warsaw]].\n\n[[File:Berezyna.jpg|thumb|Napoleon's army at the retreat from [[Russia]] at the [[Berezina]] river]]\n\nOn 12 June 1812 Napoleon [[French invasion of Russia|invaded Russia]] with a [[Grande Arm\u00e9e]] of nearly 700,000 troops. After the measured victories at [[Battle of Smolensk (1812)|Smolensk]] and [[Battle of Borodino|Borodino]] Napoleon occupied Moscow, only to find it burned by the retreating Russian army. He was forced to withdraw. On the march back his army was harassed by [[Cossacks]], and suffered disease and starvation. Only 20,000 of his men survived the campaign. By 1813 the tide had begun to turn from Napoleon. Having been defeated by a [[Sixth Coalition|seven nation army]] at the [[Battle of Leipzig]] in October 1813, he was forced to abdicate after the [[Six Days' Campaign]] and the occupation of Paris. Under the Treaty of Fontainebleau he was exiled to the island of [[Elba]]. He returned to France on 1 March 1815 (see [[Hundred Days]]), raised an army, but was finally defeated by a British and Prussian force at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] on 18 June 1815 and exiled to a small British island in the South Atlantic.\n\n====Impact of the French Revolution====\n{{main|Influence of the French Revolution}}\nRoberts finds that the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, from 1793 to 1815, caused 4 million deaths (of whom 1 million were civilians); 1.4 million were French deaths.<ref>Andrew Roberts, \"Why Napoleon merits the title 'the Great,'\" ''BBC History Magazine''  (1 November 2014)</ref>\n\nOutside France the Revolution had a major impact. Its ideas became widespread. Roberts argues that Napoleon was responsible for key ideas of the modern world, so that, \"meritocracy, equality before the law, property rights, religious toleration, modern secular education, sound finances, and so on-were protected, consolidated, codified, and geographically extended by Napoleon during his 16 years of power.\"<ref>Roberts, \"Why Napoleon merits the title 'the Great,\" ''BBC History Magazine''  (1 November 2014)</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the French armies in the 1790s and 1800s directly overthrew feudal remains in much of western Europe. They liberalised [[property law]]s, ended [[Manorialism|seigneurial dues]], abolished the [[guild]] of merchants and craftsmen to facilitate entrepreneurship, legalised divorce, closed the [[Ghetto|Jewish ghettos]] and made Jews equal to everyone else. The [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]] ended as did the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The power of church courts and religious authority was sharply reduced and [[Equality before the law|equality under the law]] was proclaimed for all men.<ref>Robert R. Palmer and Joel Colton,  ''A History of the Modern World'' (New York: McGraw Hill, 1995), pp. 428\u201329.</ref>\n\nIn foreign affairs, the French Army down to 1812 was quite successful. Roberts says that Napoleon fought 60 battles, losing only seven.<ref>Andrew Roberts, \"Why Napoleon merits the title 'the Great,\" ''BBC History Magazine''  (1 November 2014)</ref> France conquered Belgium and turned it into another province of France. It conquered the Netherlands, and made it a puppet state. It took control of the German areas on the left bank of the Rhine River and set up a puppet regime. It conquered Switzerland and most of Italy, setting up a series of puppet states. The result was glory for France, and an infusion of much needed money from the conquered lands, which also provided direct support to the French Army. However the enemies of France, led by Britain and funded by the inexhaustible British Treasury, formed a Second Coalition in 1799 (with Britain joined by Russia, the Ottoman Empire and Austria). It scored a series of victories that rolled back French successes, and trapped the French Army in Egypt. Napoleon himself slipped through the British blockade in October 1799, returning to Paris, where he overthrew the government and made himself the ruler.<ref>William Doyle, ''The Oxford History of the French Revolution'' (1989) pp. 341\u201368</ref><ref>Steven T. Ross, ''European Diplomatic History, 1789\u20131815: France Against Europe'' (1969)</ref>\n\nNapoleon conquered most of [[Italy]] in the name of the French Revolution in 1797\u201399. He consolidated old units and split up Austria's holdings. He set up a series of new republics, complete with new codes of law and abolition of old feudal privileges. Napoleon's [[Cisalpine Republic]] was centered on Milan; Genoa became a republic; the Roman Republic was formed as well as the small [[Ligurian Republic]] around Genoa. The [[Parthenopean Republic|Neapolitan Republic]] was formed around Naples, but it lasted only five months. He later formed the [[Kingdom of Italy]], with his brother as King. In addition, France turned the Netherlands into the [[Batavian Republic]], and Switzerland into the [[Helvetic Republic]]. All these new countries were satellites of France, and had to pay large subsidies to Paris, as well as provide military support for Napoleon's wars. Their political and administrative systems were modernized, the metric system introduced, and trade barriers reduced. Jewish ghettos were abolished. Belgium and Piedmont became integral parts of France.<ref>Alexander Grab, ''Napoleon and the Transformation of Europe'' (2003) pp. 62\u201365, 78\u201379, 88\u201396, 115\u201317, 154\u201359</ref>\n\nMost of the new nations were abolished and returned to prewar owners in 1814. However, Artz emphasizes the benefits the Italians gained from the French Revolution:\n:For nearly two decades the [[Italians]] had excellent codes of law, a fair system of taxation, a better economic situation, and more religious and intellectual toleration than they had known for centuries.... Everywhere old physical, economic, and intellectual barriers had been thrown down and the Italians had begun to be aware of a common nationality.<ref>Frederick B. Artz, ''Reaction and Revolution: 1814\u20131832 '' (1934) pp. 142\u201343</ref>\n\nLikewise in [[History of Switzerland|Switzerland]] the long-term impact of the French Revolution has been assessed by Martin:\n:It proclaimed the equality of citizens before the law, equality of languages, freedom of thought and faith; it created a Swiss citizenship, basis of our modern nationality, and the separation of powers, of which the old regime had no conception; it suppressed internal tariffs and other economic restraints; it unified weights and measures, reformed civil and penal law, authorized mixed marriages (between Catholics and Protestants), suppressed torture and improved justice; it developed education and public works.<ref>William Martin, ''Histoire de la Suisse'' (Paris, 1926), pp. 187\u201388, quoted in Crane Brinson, ''A Decade of Revolution: 1789\u20131799'' (1934) p. 235</ref>\n\nThe greatest impact came of course in France itself. In addition to effects similar to those in Italy and Switzerland, France saw the introduction of the principle of legal equality, and the downgrading of the once powerful and rich Catholic Church to just a bureau controlled by the government. Power became centralized in Paris, with its strong bureaucracy and an army supplied by conscripting all young men. French politics were permanently polarized \u2013 new names were given, \"left\" and \"right\" for the supporters and opponents of the principles of the Revolution.\n\nBritish historian Max Hastings says there is no question that as a military genius Napoleon ranks with Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar in greatness. However, in the political realm, historians debate whether Napoleon was \"an enlightened despot who laid the foundations of modern Europe or, instead, a megalomaniac who wrought greater misery than any man before the coming of Hitler\".<ref>Max Hastings,  \"Everything Is Owed to Glory,\" [https://www.wsj.com/articles/book-review-napoleon-a-life-by-andrew-roberts-1414788232?tesla=y&mod=WSJEUROPE_hpp_sections_ukintl&mg=reno64-wsj&url=https://www.wsj.com/article/SB12003192308051073864504580228211018002950.html?mod=WSJEUROPE_hpp_sections_ukintl ''Wall Street Journal '' 31 October 2014]</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n{{main|Christianity in the 19th century}}\nBy the 19th century, governments increasingly took over traditional religious roles, paying much more attention to efficiency and uniformity than to religiosity. Secular bodies took control of education away from the churches, abolished taxes and tithes for the support of established religions, and excluded bishops from the upper houses. Secular laws increasingly regulated marriage and divorce, and  maintaining   birth and death registers became the duty of local officials. Although the numerous religious denominations in the United States founded many colleges and universities, that was almost exclusively a state function across Europe.  Imperial powers protected Christian missionaries in African and Asian colonies.<ref>[[James Harvey Robinson]] and  [[Charles A. Beard]], \u2018\u2019The Development of Modern Europe Volume II The Merging of European into World History\u2019\u2019 (1930) v. 2 pp 88-89. [https://archive.org/details/developmentofmod007381mbp online]</ref> In France and other largely Catholic nations, anti-clerical political movements tried to reduce the role of the Catholic Church. Likewise briefly in Germany in the 1870s there was a fierce [[Kulturkampf]] (culture war) against Catholics, but the Catholics successfully fought back. The Catholic Church concentrated more power in the papacy and fought against secularism and socialism. It sponsored devotional reforms that gained wide support among the churchgoers.<ref>Kenneth Scott Latourette, ''Christianity in a Revolutionary Age, Volume I: The Nineteenth Century in Europe:  Background and the Roman Catholic Phase''  (1958) pp. 321-23, 370, 458-59, 464-66.</ref>\n====Protestantism==== \nHistorian [[Kenneth Scott Latourette]] argues that the outlook for Protestantism at the start of the 19th century was discouraging. It was a regional religion based in northwestern Europe, with an outpost in the sparsely settled United States. It was closely allied with government, as in Scandinavia, the Netherlands, Prussia, and especially Great Britain. The alliance came at the expense of independence, as the government made the basic policy decisions, down to such details as the salaries of ministers and location of new churches. The dominant intellectual currents of the Enlightenment promoted rationalism, and most Protestant leaders preached a sort of deism. Intellectually, the new methods of historical and anthropological study undermine automatic acceptance of biblical stories, as did the sciences of geology and biology. Industrialization was a strongly negative factor, as workers who moved to the city seldom joined churches. The gap between the church and the unchurched grew rapidly, and secular forces, based both in socialism and liberalism undermine the prestige of religion. Despite the negative forces, Protestantism demonstrated a striking vitality by 1900. Shrugging off Enlightenment rationalism, Protestants embraced [[romanticism]], with the stress on the personal and the invisible. Entirely fresh ideas as expressed by [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]], [[Soren Kierkegaard]], [[Albrecht Ritschl]] and [[Adolf von Harnack]] restored the intellectual power of theology. There was more attention to historic creeds such as the Augsburg, the Heidelberg, and the Westminster confessions. In England, Anglicans emphasize the historically Catholic components of their heritage, as the High Church element reintroduced vestments and incense into their rituals. The stirrings of [[pietism]] on the Continent, and [[evangelicalism]] in Britain expanded enormously, leading the devout away from an emphasis on formality and ritual and toward an inner sensibility toward personal relationship to Christ. Social activities, in education and in opposition to social vices such as slavery, alcoholism and poverty provided new opportunities for social service. Above all, worldwide missionary activity became a highly prized goal, proving quite successful in close cooperation with the imperialism of the British, German, and Dutch empires.<ref>Kenneth Scott Latourette, ''Christianity in a Revolutionary Age, II: The Nineteenth Century in Europe: The Protestant and Eastern Churches'' (1959) pp. 428\u201331</ref>\n\n===Nations rising===\n\n{{Main|International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)|Serbian Revolution|Italian unification||Revolutions of 1848|Greek War of Independence}}\n[[File:Maerz1848 berlin.jpg|thumb|right|Cheering the [[Revolutions of 1848]] in Berlin]]\n\n====Emerging nationalism====\n{{further|Nationalism}}\nThe political development of nationalism and the push for [[popular sovereignty]] culminated with the ethnic/national revolutions of Europe.

It was the political and intellectual movement that consolidated different states of the Italian peninsula into the single state of the Kingdom of Italy in 1860. The memory of the Risorgimento is central to both Italian nationalism and Italian historiography.<ref>Silvana Patriarca and Lucy Riall, eds., ''The Risorgimento Revisited: Nationalism and Culture in Nineteenth-century Italy'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2011).</ref>\n\n[[File:Missolonghi.jpg|thumb|Beginning in 1821, the [[Greek War of Independence]] began as a rebellion by Greek revolutionaries against the ruling Ottoman Empire.]]\n====Serbia====\n{{main|History of Serbia}}\n[[File:Breakup of Yugoslavia-TRY2.gif|thumb|250px|Breakup of Yugoslavia]]\n\nFor centuries the Orthodox Christian Serbs were ruled by the [[Muslim]]-controlled [[Ottoman Empire]]. The success of the [[Serbian revolution]] (1804-1817) against [[History of Ottoman Serbia|Ottoman rule]] in 1817 marked the foundation of modern [[Principality of Serbia]]. It achieved ''de facto'' independence in 1867 and finally gained recognition by the Great Powers in the [[Berlin Congress|Berlin Congress of 1878]]. The Serbs developed a larger vision for nationalism in [[Pan-Slavism]] and with Russian support sought to pull the other Slavs out of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]].<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 2142012|title = Pan-Slavism and European Politics|journal = Political Science Quarterly|volume = 29|issue = 4|pages = 664\u2013686|last1 = Levine|first1 = Louis|year = 1914|doi = 10.2307/2142012}}</ref><ref>Charles Jelavich, ''Tsarist Russia and Balkan nationalism: Russian influence in the internal affairs of Bulgaria and Serbia, 1879\u20131886'' (1958).</ref> Austria, with German backing, tried to crush Serbia in 1914 but Russia intervened, thus igniting the [[First World War]] in which Austria dissolved into nation states.<ref>Christopher Clark, ''The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914'' (2012)</ref>\n\nIn 1918, the region of [[Vojvodina]] proclaimed its [[Banat, Ba\u010dka and Baranja|secession]] from Austria-Hungary to unite with the pan-Slavic [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]]; the Kingdom of Serbia joined the union on 1 December 1918, and the country was named [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]]. It was renamed [[Yugoslavia]], which was never able to tame the multiple nationalities and religions and it flew apart in civil war in the 1990s.\n\n====Greece====\n{{main|Greek War of Independence}}\nThe Greek drive for independence from the Ottoman Empire inspired supporters across Christian Europe, especially in Britain. France, Russia and Britain intervened to make this nationalist dream become reality with the [[Greek War of Independence]] (1821-1829/1830).<ref>{{cite book|author=Alister E.

Russia, as a World [[Great Power]] of fellow [[Eastern Orthodox Slavs|Orthodox Slavs]], could appeal to the [[Bulgarians]] in a way that Austria could not. An autonomous [[Bulgarian Exarchate]] was established for the dioceses of Bulgaria as well as those, wherein at least two thirds of Orthodox Christians were willing to join it. The [[April Uprising of 1876|April Uprising]] in 1876 indirectly resulted in the re-establishment of Bulgaria in 1878.\n\n====Poland====\n{{main|History of Poland}}\nThe cause of Polish nationalism was repeatedly frustrated before 1918. In the 1790s, Germany, Russia and Austria [[Partitions of Poland|partitioned Poland]]. Napoleon set up the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], a new Polish state that ignited a spirit of nationalism. Russia took it over in 1815 as [[Congress Poland]] with the tsar as King of Poland. Large-scale nationalist revolts erupted [[November Uprising|in 1830]] and [[January Uprising|1863\u201364]] but were harshly crushed by Russia, which tried to Russify the Polish language, culture and religion. The collapse of the Russian Empire in the First World War enabled the major powers to reestablish an independent Poland, which survived until 1939. Meanwhile, Poles in areas controlled by Germany moved into heavy industry but their religion came under attack by Bismarck in the [[Kulturkampf]] of the 1870s. The Poles joined German Catholics in a well-organized new [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], and defeated Bismarck politically. He responded by stopping the harassment and cooperating with the Centre Party.<ref>Richard Blanke, ''Prussian Poland in the German Empire (1871\u20131900)'' (1981)</ref><ref>Norman Davies, ''God's Playground: A History of Poland, Vol. 2: 1795 to the Present'' (2005).</ref>\n\n===Education===\nAn important component of nationalism was the study of the nation's heritage, emphasizing the national language and literary culture. This stimulated, and was in turn strongly supported by, the emergence of national educational systems reaching the general population. Latin gave way to the national language, and compulsory education, with strong support from modernizers and the media, became standard throughout Western countries. Voting reforms extended the franchise to the previously uneducated elements. A strong sentiment among the elites was the necessity for compulsory public education, so that the new electorate could understand and handle its duties. Every country developed a sense of national origins \u2013 the historical accuracy was less important than the motivation toward patriotism. Universal compulsory education was extended as well to girls, at least at the elementary level. By the 1890s, strong movements emerged in some countries, including France, Germany and the United States, to extend compulsory education to the secondary level.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ellwood Patterson Cubberley|title=The History of Education: Educational Practice and Progress Considered as a Phase of the Development and Spread of Western Civilization|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|url=https://archive.org/details/historyeducatio02cubbgoog|year=1920|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyeducatio02cubbgoog/page/n742 711]\u201323}}</ref>\n\n====Ideological coalitions====\n[[File:Bakunin speaking.png|thumb|upright=0.85|[[Mikhail Bakunin]] speaking to members of the [[International Workingmen's Association]] at the [[Basel Congress (1869)|Basel Congress]] in 1869]]\nAfter the defeat of revolutionary France, the other great powers tried to restore the situation which existed before 1789. In 1815 at the [[Congress of Vienna]], the major powers of Europe managed to produce a peaceful [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] among the various European empires. This was known as the [[Metternich]] system. The powerbase of their support was the aristocracy, with its great landed wealth and control of the government, the church, and the military in most countries. However, their efforts were unable to stop the spread of revolutionary movements: the middle classes had been deeply influenced by the ideals of the French revolution, and the [[Industrial Revolution]] brought important economical and social changes.<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Viereck|title=Conservative Thinkers: From John Adams to Winston Churchill|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qXxHHXwJT28C&pg=PA71|year=1978|pages=71\u201377|isbn=978-1-4128-2026-4}}</ref>\n\nRadical intellectuals looked to the working classes for a base for socialist, communist and [[anarchism|anarchistic]] ideas.

Aristocratic elements concentrated in government service, the military and the established churches. Nationalist movements (in Germany, Italy, Poland, Hungary, and elsewhere) called upon the \"racial\" unity (which usually meant a common language and an imagined common ethnicity) to seek national unification and/or liberation from foreign rule. As a result, the period between 1815 and 1871 saw a large number of revolutionary attempts and independence wars. Greece successfully revolted against Ottoman rule in the 1820s. European diplomats and intellectuals saw the Greek struggle for independence, with its accounts of Turkish atrocities, in a romantic light.<ref>{{cite book|author=Pamela Pilbeam|title=The Middle Classes in Europe, 1789\u20131914: France, Germany, Italy, and Russia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZkZdDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA240|year=1990|page=240|isbn=978-1-349-20606-3}}</ref>\n\n====France under Napoleon III====\n[[Napoleon III]], nephew of Napoleon I, returned to France from exile in 1848, bringing a famous name that promised to stabilize the chaotic political situation.

Germany in particular increasingly dominated the continent in terms of economics and political power. Meanwhile, on a global scale, Great Britain, with its far-flung [[British Empire]], unmatched Royal Navy, and powerful bankers, became the world's first global power. The sun never set on its territories, while an informal empire operated through British financiers, entrepreneurs, traders and engineers who established operations in many countries, and largely dominated Latin America. The British were especially famous for financing and constructing railways around the world.<ref>Andrew Porter and William Roger Louis, eds.

With that accomplished by 1871 he then skillfully used [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] diplomacy to preserve Germany's new role and keep Europe at peace. He was removed from office in 1890 by an aggressive young Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], who pursued a disruptive foreign policy that polarized Europe into rival camps.

[[Austria-Hungary]] had the advantage of size, but multiple disadvantages. There were rivals on four sides, its finances were unstable, the population was fragmented into multiple ethnicities and languages that served as the bases for separatist nationalisms. It had a large army with good forts, but its industrial base was thin. Its naval resources were so minimal that it did not attempt to build an overseas empire. It did have the advantage of good diplomats, typified by [[Klemens von Metternich|Metternich (Foreign Minister 1809\u20131848, Prime Minister, 1821\u20131848))]]. They employed a grand strategy for survival that balanced out different forces, set up buffer zones, and kept the Habsburg empire going despite wars with the Ottomans, Frederick the Great, Napoleon and Bismarck, until the final disaster of the First World War. The Empire overnight disintegrated into multiple states based on ethnic nationalism and the principle of self-determination.<ref>{{cite book|author=A.

The initial impulse behind these dispersed maritime empires and those that followed was trade, driven by the new ideas and the capitalism that grew out of the [[Renaissance]]. Both the [[Portuguese Empire]] and [[Spanish Empire]] quickly grew into the first global political and economic systems with territories spread around the world.\n\nSubsequent major European colonial empires included the [[French colonial empire|French]], [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], and [[British Empire|British]] empires. The latter, consolidated during the period of British maritime hegemony in the 19th century, became the largest empire in history because of the improved ocean transportation technologies of the time as well as electronic communication through the telegraph, cable, and radio. At its height in 1920, the British Empire covered a quarter of the Earth's land area and comprised a quarter of its population. Other European countries, such as [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgium]], [[German colonial empire|Germany]], and [[Italian colonial empire|Italy]], pursued colonial empires as well (mostly in Africa), but they were smaller. Ignoring the oceans, Russia built its [[Russian Empire]] through conquest by land in Eastern Europe, and Asia.\n\nBy the mid-19th century, the [[Ottoman Empire]] had declined enough to become a target for other global powers (see [[History of the Balkans]]). This instigated the [[Crimean War]] in 1854 and began a tenser period of minor clashes among the globe-spanning empires of Europe that eventually set the stage for the [[First World War]]. In the second half of the 19th century, the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] carried out a series of wars that resulted in the creation of [[Italy]] and [[Germany]] as nation-states, significantly changing the balance of power in Europe. From 1870, [[Otto von Bismarck]] engineered a German hegemony of Europe that put France in a critical situation. It slowly rebuilt its relationships, seeking alliances with Russia and Britain to control the growing power of Germany. In this way, two opposing sides \u2013 the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance of 1882]] (Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy) and the [[Triple Entente|Triple Entente of 1907]] (Britain, France and Russia) \u2013 formed in Europe, improving their military forces and alliances year-by-year.\n\n[[File:Quarto Stato.jpg|thumb|[[The Fourth Estate (painting)]] by [[Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo]].]]\n==1914\u20131945: Two World wars==\n[[File:Map Europe alliances 1914-en.svg|thumb|320px|right|Military alliances leading to World War; Triple Entente in green; Central Powers in brown]]\n\nGerman-American historian [[Konrad Jarausch]], asked if he agreed that \"the European record of the past century [was] just one gigantic catastrophe\", argues:\n:It is true that the first half of the 20th century was full of internecine warfare, economic depression, ethnic cleansing and racist genocide that killed tens of millions of people, more than any other period in human history. But looking only at the disasters creates an incomplete perception, because the second half of the century witnessed a much more positive development in spite of the Cold War. After the defeat of Fascism in 1945, the peaceful revolution of 1989/90 also liberated the East from Communist control in a quite unexpected fashion. As a result, Europeans generally live more free, prosperous and healthy lives than ever before.<ref>See [http://press.princeton.edu/releases/m10427.html \"An Interview with Konrad H.

The First World War used modern technology to kill millions of soldiers. Victory by Britain, France, the United States and other allies drastically changed the map of Europe, ending four major land empires (the Russian, German, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires) and leading to the creation of nation-states across Central and Eastern Europe. The [[October Revolution]] in Russia led to the creation of the [[Soviet Union]] (1917\u20131991) and the rise of the international communist movement. Widespread economic prosperity was typical of the period before 1914, and 1920\u20131929. After the onset of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929, however, democracy collapsed in most of Europe. Fascists took control in Italy, and the even more aggressive Nazi movement led by Adolf Hitler took control of Germany, 1933\u201345. The Second World War was fought on an even larger scale than the First war, killing many more people, and using even more advanced technology. It ended with the division of Europe between East and West, with the East under the control of the Soviet Union and the West dominated by NATO. The two sides engaged in the [[Cold War]], with actual conflict taking place not in Europe but in Asia in the Korean War and the Vietnam War. The Imperial system collapsed. The remaining [[colonial empire]]s ended through the [[decolonisation]] of European rule in Africa and Asia. The fall of Soviet Communism (1989\u20131991) left the West dominant and enabled the [[reunification of Germany]]. It accelerated the process of a [[European integration]] to include Eastern Europe. The European Union continues today, but with German economic dominance. Since the worldwide Great Recession of 2008, European growth has been slow, and financial crises have hit Greece and other countries. While Russia is a weak version of the old Soviet Union, it has been confronting Europe in Ukraine and other areas.\n\n===World War I===\n{{Main|World War I|Home front during World War I|Diplomatic history of World War I|Economic history of World War I}}\n[[File:trencheswwi2.jpg|thumb|Trenches and sand bags were defences against machine guns and artillery on the Western Front, 1914\u20131918]]\n\nAfter the relative peace of most of the 19th century, the rivalry between European powers, compounded by a rising nationalism among ethnic groups, exploded in August 1914, when the [[First World War]] started.<ref>Brian Bond,  \"The First World War\" in [[C.L.

The Western Front involved especially brutal combat without any territorial gains by either side. Single battles like Verdun and the Somme killed hundreds of thousands of men while leaving the stalemate unchanged. Heavy artillery and machine guns caused most of the casualties, supplemented by poison gas. Czarist Russia collapsed in the [[February Revolution]] of 1917 and Germany claimed victory on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]]. After eight months of liberal rule, the [[October Revolution]] brought [[Vladimir Lenin]] and the Bolsheviks to power, leading to the creation of the Soviet Union in place of the disintegrated Russian Empire. With American entry into the war in 1917 on the Allied side, and the failure of Germany's spring 1918 offensive, Germany had run out of manpower, while an average of 10,000 American troops were arriving in France every day in the summer of 1918. Germany's allies, [[Austria-Hungary]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]], surrendered and dissolved, followed by Germany on 11 November 1918.<ref>Overviews include David Stevenson,  ''Cataclysm: The First World War as Political Tragedy'' (2005) and Ian F.

Big business, industry, and finance retained extensive autonomy, particularly in the early years. The armed forces also enjoyed considerable autonomy....The Fascist militia was placed under military control....The judicial system was left largely intact and relatively autonomous as well. The police continued to be directed by state officials and were not taken over by party leaders...nor was a major new police elite created....There was never any question of bringing the Church under overall subservience....

In most of Europe, as well as in Japan and most of Latin America, nation after nation turned to dictators and authoritarian regimes. The most momentous change of government came when Hitler and his Nazis took power in Germany in 1933. The main institution that was meant to bring stability was the [[League of Nations]], created in 1919. However the League failed to resolve any major crises and by 1938 it was no longer a major player. The League was undermined by the bellicosity of [[Nazi Germany]], [[Imperial Japan]], the Soviet Union, and [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's]] Italy, and by the non-participation of the United States. By 1937 it was largely ignored.<ref>F.P. Walters, ''A History of the League of Nations'' (Oxford UP, 1965).

The Soviet Union sold armaments to the leftist Republicans on the other side, while the Communist parties in numerous countries sent soldiers to the \"[[International Brigades]].\" The civil war did not escalate into a larger conflict, but did become a worldwide ideological battleground that pitted the left, the communist movement and many liberals against Catholics, conservatives, and fascists. Britain, France and the US remained neutral and refused to sell military supplies to either side.

Hitler's goal was to control Eastern Europe but because of his failure to defeat Britain and the Italian failures in North Africa and the Balkans, the great attack on the Soviet Union was delayed until June 1941. Despite initial successes, the German army was stopped close to Moscow in December 1941.<ref>I.C.B. Dear and M.R.D. Foot, eds., ''The Oxford Companion to World War II'' (1995) covers every country and major campaign.</ref>\n\nOver the next year the tide was turned and the Germans started to suffer a series of defeats, for example in the siege of [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] and at [[Battle of Kursk|Kursk]]. Meanwhile, Japan (allied to Germany and Italy since September 1940) attacked Britain and the United States on 7 December 1941; Germany then completed its over-extension by declaring war on the United States. War raged between the Axis Powers (Germany, Italy, and Japan) and the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] (British Empire, Soviet Union, and the United States). The Allied Forces won in North Africa, invaded Italy in 1943, and recaptured France in 1944. In the spring of 1945 Germany itself was invaded from the east by the Soviet Union and from the west by the other Allies. As the Red Army conquered the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]] in Berlin, Hitler committed suicide and Germany surrendered in early May.<ref>Norman Davies, ''No Simple Victory: World War II in Europe, 1939\u20131945'' (2008)</ref> World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history, causing [[World War II casualties|between 50 and 80 million deaths]], the majority of whom were civilians (approximately 38 to 55 million).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://necrometrics.com/20c5m.htm |title=Second''Second Source List and Detailed Death Tolls for the Twentieth Century Hemoclysm'' |publisher=Users.erols.com |accessdate=2 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nThis period was also marked by systematic genocide. In 1942\u201345, separately from the war-related deaths, the [[Nazism|Nazis]] killed an additional number of over 11 million civilians [[IBM and the Holocaust|identified through IBM-enabled censuses]], including the [[The Holocaust|majority of the Jews]] and [[Porajmos|Gypsies]] of Europe, millions of [[Nazi crimes against ethnic Poles|Polish]] and [[Generalplan Ost|Soviet]] Slavs, and also homosexuals, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], misfits, disabled, and political enemies. Meanwhile, in the 1930s the Soviet system of [[Gulag|forced labour]], [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|expulsions]] and [[Holodomor|allegedly engineered famine]] had a similar death toll.

The United States and the majority of European liberal democracies at the time (United Kingdom, France, Italy, Netherlands, West Germany etc.) established the [[NATO]] military alliance. Later, the Soviet Union and its satellites (Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, [[East Germany]], Hungary, Poland, and Romania) in 1955 established the [[Warsaw Pact]] as a counterpoint to NATO. The Warsaw Pact had a much larger ground force, but the American-French-British nuclear umbrellas protected NATO.\n\n[[Communist state]]s were imposed by the Red Army in the East, while parliamentary democracy became the dominant form of government in the West. Most historians point to its success as the product of exhaustion with war and dictatorship, and the promise of continued economic prosperity. Martin Conway also adds that an important impetus came from the anti-Nazi wartime political coalitions.<ref>Martin Conway, \"The Rise and Fall of Western Europe's Democratic Age, 1945\u2013\u20131973,\" ''Contemporary European History'' (2004) 13#1 pp. 67\u201388.</ref>\n\n===Economic recovery===\n{{Main|Marshall Plan|European Economic Community}}\nThe United States gave away about $20 billion in [[Marshall Plan]] grants and other grants and low-interest long-term loans to Western Europe, 1945 to 1951. Historian Michael J. Hogan argues that American aid was critical in stabilizing the economy and politics of Western Europe. It brought in modern management that dramatically increased productivity, and encouraged cooperation between labor and management, and among the member states. Local Communist parties were opposed, and they lost prestige and influence and a role in government. In strategic terms, says Hogan, the Marshall Plan strengthened the West against The possibility of a Communist invasion or political takeover.<ref>Michael J. Hogan, ''The Marshall Plan: America, Britain and the Reconstruction of Western Europe, 1947\u20131952'' (1989)  pp. 26\u201328, 430\u201343.</ref> However, the Marshall Plan's role in the rapid recovery has been debated. Most reject the idea that it only miraculously revived Europe, since the evidence shows that a general recovery was already under way thanks to other aid programs from the United States. Economic historians Bradford De Long and [[Barry Eichengreen]] conclude it was, \" History's Most Successful Structural Adjustment Program.\" They state:\n:It was not large enough to have significantly accelerated recovery by financing investment, aiding the reconstruction of damaged infrastructure, or easing commodity bottlenecks. We argue, however, that the Marshall Plan did play a major role in setting the stage for post-World War II Western Europe's rapid growth. The conditions attached to Marshall Plan aid pushed European political economy in a direction that left its post World War II \"mixed economies\" with more \"market\" and less \"controls\" in the mix.<ref>{{cite book |first=J.

It seized and transferred most of Germany's industrial plants and it exacted war reparations from East Germany, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, using Soviet-dominated joint enterprises. It used trading arrangements deliberately designed to favor the Soviet Union. Moscow controlled the Communist parties that ruled the satellite states, and they followed orders from the Kremlin. Historian Mark Kramer concludes:\n:The net outflow of resources from eastern Europe to the Soviet Union was approximately $15 billion to $20 billion in the first decade after World War II, an amount roughly equal to the total aid provided by the United States to western Europe under the Marshall Plan.<ref>Mark Kramer, \"The Soviet Bloc and the Cold War in Europe,\" {{cite book|author=Klaus Larresm ed.|title=A Companion to Europe Since 1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EyNcCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT174|year=2014|publisher=Wiley|page=79|isbn=978-1-118-89024-0}}</ref>\n\nWestern Europe began economic and then political integration, with the aim to unite the region and defend it. This process included organisations such as the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which grew and evolved into the [[European Union]], and the [[Council of Europe]]. The [[Solidarno\u015b\u0107]] movement in the 1980s weakened the Communist government in Poland. At the time the Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] initiated [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]], which weakened Soviet influence in Europe, particularly in the USSR. In 1989 the Berlin Wall came down and Communist governments outside the Soviet Union were deposed. In 1990 the Federal Republic of Germany absorbed East Germany, after making large cash payments to the USSR. In 1991 the Communist Party in Moscow collapsed, [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|ending the USSR]], which split into fifteen independent states. The largest, Russia, took the Soviet Union's seat on the [[United Nations Security Council]]. The most violent dissolution happened in [[Yugoslavia]], in the Balkans. Four ([[Slovenia]], Croatia, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[North Macedonia]]) out of six Yugoslav republics declared independence and for most of them a violent war ensued, in some parts lasting until 1995. In 2006 Montenegro seceded and became an independent state. In the post\u2013Cold War era, NATO and the EU have been gradually admitting most of the former members of the Warsaw Pact.\n\nLooking at the half century after the war historian [[Walter Laqueur|Walter Lacquer]] concluded:\n:\"The postwar generations of European elites aimed to create more democratic societies. They wanted to reduce the extremes of wealth and poverty and provide essential social services in a way that prewar generations had not. They had had quite enough of unrest and conflict. For decades many Continental societies had more or less achieved these aims and had every reason to be proud of their progress. Europe was quiet and civilized. Europe's success was based on recent painful experience: the horrors of two world wars; the lessons of dictatorship; the experiences of fascism and communism. Above all, it was based on a feeling of European identity and common values \u2013 or so it appeared at the time.\"<ref>Walter Laqueur, \"The Slow Death of Europe\", ''The National Interest'' [http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/why-the-euro-the-least-europes-worries-5767 16 August 2011 online]</ref>\n\nThe post-war period also witnessed a significant rise in the standard of living of the Western European working class. As noted by one historical text, \"within a single generation, the working classes of Western Europe came to enjoy the multiple pleasures of the consumer society.\"<ref name=\"google2\">{{cite book|title=Is There Still a West?: The Future of the Atlantic Alliance|author1=Hay, W.A.|author2=Sicherman, H.|date=2007|publisher=University of Missouri Press, Queen Elizabeth also had a major breakdown causing her to die cause of the stress overload.|isbn=978-0-8262-6549-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VwDQ3jAGMX0C|page=107|accessdate=18 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nWestern Europe's industrial nations in the 1970s were hit by a global economic crisis. They had obsolescent heavy industry, and suddenly had to pay very high energy prices which caused sharp inflation. Some of them also had inefficient nationalized railways and heavy industries. In the important field of computer technology, European nations lagged behind the United States. They also faced high government deficits and growing unrest led by militant labour unions. There was an urgent need for new economic directions. Germany and Sweden sought to create a social consensus behind a gradual restructuring. Germany's efforts proved highly successful. In Britain under the leadership of [[Margaret Thatcher]], the solution was shock therapy, high interest rates, austerity, and selling off inefficient corporations as well as the public housing, which was sold off to the tenants. One result was escalating social tensions in Britain, led by the militant coal miners. Thatcher eventually defeated her opponents and radically changed the British economy, but the controversy never went away as shown by the hostile demonstrations at the time of her death in 2013.<ref>David Priestland, \"Margaret Thatcher?\" \u2018\u2019BBC History Magazine\u2019\u2019 1 May 2013</ref>\n\n==Recent history==\n{{Further |Cold War (1979\u20131985)|History of the European Union}}\n\n[[File:Thefalloftheberlinwall1989.JPG|thumb|right|Germans standing on top of the [[Berlin Wall]] at the [[Brandenburg Gate]], November 1989; it would begin to be torn apart in the following days.]]\n[[File:Cold War border changes.png|thumb|upright=1.182|Changes in national boundaries after the end of the Cold War]]\n\nThe ending of the Cold War came in a rush of events in 1979 to 1991, chiefly in Eastern Europe, that brought the end of the Soviet control over its East European satellites and its world network of communist parties (1989) and ending with the final splitting up of the Soviet Union in 1991 into 15 non-communist states. Italian historian Federico Romero reports that observers at the time emphasized that,:\n:The systemic and ideological confrontation between capitalism and communism had faded away. The geopolitical partition of Europe was no more. Nuclear deterrence was morphing into a less armed, almost hypothetical version of its previous self. Superpower rivalry was rapidly wound up with cascading effects in various areas of the world.<ref>Federico Romero, ''Cold War historiography at the crossroads,\" ''Cold War History'' (2014), 14:4, 685\u2013703, {{DOI| 10.1080/14682745.2014.950249}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the end of the Cold War, the [[European Economic Community]] pushed for closer integration, co-operation in foreign and home affairs, and started to increase its membership into the neutral and former communist countries. In 1993, the [[Maastricht Treaty]] established the [[European Union]], succeeding the EEC and furthering political co-operation. The neutral countries of Austria, Finland and Sweden acceded to the EU, and those that didn't join were tied into the EU's economic market via the [[European Economic Area]]. These countries also entered the [[Schengen Agreement]] which lifted border controls between member states.<ref name=\"Europa History 90-99\">{{cite web |title=A Europe without frontiers |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/1990-1999/index_en.htm |accessdate=25 June 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe Maastricht Treaty created a single currency for most EU members. The ''[[euro]]'' was created in 1999 and replaced all previous currencies in participating states in 2002. The most notable exception to the currency union, or ''[[eurozone]]'', was the United Kingdom, which also did not sign the Schengen Agreement.\n\nEU did not participate in the [[Yugoslav Wars]], and was divided on supporting the United States in the 2003\u20132011 [[Iraq War]].

These were followed by [[2007 enlargement of the European Union|Bulgaria and Romania in 2007]].

During the [[Neolithic Europe|Neolithic era]] and the time of the [[Indo-European migrations]] Europe saw human inflows from east and southeast and subsequent important cultural and material exchange. The period known as [[classical antiquity]] began with the emergence of the city-states of [[ancient Greece]]. Later, the [[Roman Empire]] came to dominate the entire [[Mediterranean basin]]. The fall of the Roman Empire in AD 476 traditionally marks the start of the [[Middle Ages]]. Beginning in the 14th century a [[Renaissance]] of knowledge challenged traditional doctrines in science and theology. Simultaneously, the [[Protestant Reformation]] set up Protestant churches primarily in Germany, Scandinavia and England. After 1800, the [[Industrial Revolution]] brought prosperity to Britain and Western Europe. The main powers set up colonies in most of the Americas and Africa, and parts of Asia. In the 20th century, [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] resulted in massive numbers of deaths. The [[Cold War]] dominated European geo-politics from 1947 to 1989.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Overview==\nDuring the [[Neolithic Europe|Neolithic era]] (starting at c.\u20097000 BC.) and the time of the [[Indo-European migrations]] (starting at c.\u20094000 BC.) Europe saw massive migrations from east and southeast which also brought agriculture, new technologies, and the Indo-European languages, primarily through the areas of the [[Balkan peninsula]] and the [[Black sea]] region.\n\nSome of the best-known civilizations of the late prehistoric Europe were the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]], which flourished during the [[Bronze Age]] until they [[Bronze Age collapse|collapsed]] in a short period of time around 1200 BC.\n\nThe period known as [[classical antiquity]] began with the emergence of the city-states of [[Ancient Greece]]. After ultimately checking the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] advance in Europe through the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] in the 5th century BC, Greek influence reached its zenith under the expansive empire of [[Alexander the Great]], spreading throughout [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and other parts of Europe. The [[Thracians]] and their [[Odrysian kingdom|kingdoms]] and [[Thracian treasure|culture]] were long present in [[Southeast Europe]]. The [[Roman Empire]] came to dominate the entire [[Mediterranean basin]]. By 300 AD the Roman Empire was divided into the [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] and [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern]] empires. During the 4th and 5th centuries, the [[Germanic peoples]] of [[Northern Europe]], pressed by the [[Huns]], grew in strength and led repeated attacks that resulted in the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]]. The Western empire's collapse in AD 476 traditionally marks the end of the classical period and the start of the [[Middle Ages]].\n\nIn [[Western Europe]], Germanic peoples became more powerful in the remnants of the former Western Roman Empire and established kingdoms and empires of their own. Of all of the Germanic peoples, the [[Franks]] would rise to a position of [[hegemony]] over Western Europe, the [[Frankish Empire]] reaching its peak under [[Charlemagne]] around 800. This empire was later divided into several parts; [[West Francia]] would evolve into the [[Kingdom of France]], while [[East Francia]] would evolve into the [[Holy Roman Empire]], a precursor to modern Germany and Italy. The [[British Isles]] were the site of several large-scale migrations.\n\nThe [[Byzantine Empire]] \u2013 the eastern part of the [[Roman Empire]], with its capital [[Constantinople]], survived for the next 1000 years as the most dominant [[List of empires|empire]] in [[Southeast Europe]]. The powerful and long lived [[Bulgarian Empire]] was its main competitor in the region. Both empires were major powers in that part of Europe for centuries, both creating [[Byzantine art|important]] [[Golden Age of medieval Bulgarian culture|cultural]], [[Third Rome|political]], [[Cyrillic script|linguistic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|religious]] legacy through the [[Middle Ages]] to this day.\n\nThe [[Viking Age]], a period of migrations of Scandinavian peoples, occurred from the late 8th century to the middle 11th century. The [[Normans]], descendants of the [[Vikings]] who settled in Northern France, had a significant impact on many parts of Europe, from the [[Norman conquest of England]] to [[Norman conquest of Sicily|Sicily]]. The [[Rus' people]] founded [[Kievan Rus']], which evolved into Russia. After 1000 the [[Crusades]] were a series of religiously motivated military expeditions originally intended to bring the [[Levant]] back under Christian rule. The Crusaders opened trade routes which enabled the merchant republics of [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] to become major economic powers. The [[Reconquista]], a related movement, worked to reconquer [[Iberia]] for [[Christendom]].\n\n[[File:Les Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du duc de Berry octobre detail.jpg|thumb|The peasants preparing the fields for the winter with a [[harrow (tool)|harrow]] and sowing for the winter grain, from ''[[The Very Rich Hours of the Duke of Berry]]'', c.1410|left]]\n\n[[Eastern Europe]] in the [[High Middle Ages]] was dominated by the rise and fall of the [[Mongol Empire]]. Led by [[Genghis Khan]], the Mongols were a group of [[steppe nomad]]s who established a decentralized empire which, at its height, extended from China in the east to the Black and Baltic Seas in Europe. As Mongol power waned towards the [[Late Middle Ages]], the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] rose to become the strongest of the numerous Russian principalities and republics and would grow into the [[Tsardom of Russia]] in 1547. The Late Middle Ages represented a period of upheaval in Europe. The epidemic known as the [[Black Death]] and an associated famine caused demographic catastrophe in Europe as the population plummeted. Dynastic struggles and wars of conquest kept many of the states of Europe at war for much of the period. In Scandinavia, the [[Kalmar Union]] dominated the political landscape, while England fought with Scotland in the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] and with France in the [[Hundred Years' War]]. In [[Central Europe]], the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] became a large territorial empire, while the Holy Roman Empire, which was an [[elective monarchy]], came to be dominated for centuries by the [[House of Habsburg]]. Russia continued to expand southward and eastward into former Mongol lands. In the [[Balkans]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] overran Byzantine lands, culminating in the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, which historians mark as the end of the Middle Ages.\n\nBeginning in the 14th century in [[Florence]] and later spreading through Europe, a [[Renaissance]] of knowledge challenged traditional doctrines in science and theology. The rediscovery of classical Greek and Roman knowledge had an enormous liberating effect on intellectuals. Simultaneously, the [[Protestant Reformation]] under German [[Martin Luther]] questioned Papal authority. [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] seized control of the English Church and its lands. The [[European religious wars]] were fought between German and Spanish rulers. The [[Reconquista]] ended Muslim rule in [[Iberia]]. By the 1490s a series of oceanic explorations marked the [[Age of Discovery]], establishing direct links with Africa, [[the Americas]], and Asia. Religious wars continued to be fought in Europe, until the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]]. The [[Spanish empire|Spanish crown]] maintained its hegemony in Europe and was the leading power on the continent until the signing of the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]], which ended a conflict between Spain and France that had begun during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. An unprecedented series of major wars and political revolutions took place around Europe and the world in the period between 1610 and 1700.<ref>Geoffrey Parker, \"States Make War But Wars Also Break States,\"''Journal of Military History'' (2010) 74#1 pp. 11\u201334</ref>\n\n[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|thumb|A [[Watt steam engine]]. The [[steam engine]], fuelled primarily by coal, propelled the [[Industrial Revolution]] in 19th-century [[Northwestern Europe]].]]\n\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]] began in [[Great Britain|Britain]], based on coal, steam, and textile mills. Political change in [[continental Europe]] was spurred by the [[French Revolution]] under the motto ''[[libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9]]''. [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] took control, made many reforms inside France, and transformed Western Europe. But his rise stimulated both nationalism and reaction and he was defeated in 1814\u201315 as the old royal conservatives returned to power.\n\nThe period between 1815 and 1871 saw revolutionary attempts in much of Europe (apart from Britain). They all failed however. As industrial work forces grew in Western Europe, [[socialism]] and [[trade union]] activity developed. The last vestiges of [[serfdom]] were abolished [[Serfdom in Russia|in Russia]] in 1861. Greece and the other [[Balkans|Balkan nations]] began a long slow road to [[History of the Balkans|independence]] from the [[Ottoman Empire]], starting in the 1820s. Italy was unified in its [[Risorgimento]] in 1860. After the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870\u201371, [[Otto von Bismarck]] unified the German states into an empire that was politically and militarily dominant until 1914. Most of Europe scrambled for imperial colonies [[Scramble for Africa|in Africa]] and Asia in [[the Age of Empire]]. Britain and France built the largest empires, while diplomats ensured there were no major wars in Europe, apart from the [[Crimean War]] of the 1850s.\n\nThe outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914 was precipitated by the rise of nationalism in [[Southeastern Europe]] as the [[Great Powers]] took sides. The 1917 [[October Revolution]] led the [[Russian Empire]] to become the world's first [[communist state]], the [[Soviet Union]]. The [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], led by Britain, France, and the United States, defeated the [[Central Powers]], led by the [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], in 1918. During the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] the [[The Big Four (World War I)|Big Four]] imposed their terms in a series of treaties, especially the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The war's human and material devastation was unprecedented.\n\nGermany lost its overseas empire and several provinces, had to pay large reparations, and was humiliated by the victors. They in turn had large debts to the United States. The 1920s were prosperous until 1929 when the [[Great Depression]] broke out, which led to the collapse of democracy in many European states. The [[Nazi]] regime under [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in 1933, rearmed Germany, and along with [[Italian Fascism|Mussolini's Italy]] sought to assert themselves on the continent by demands and appeasement, leading eventually to the [[Second World War]]. Most of the fighting took place on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], and the war ended with the defeat of the [[Axis powers]], leaving the USSR and the United States dominating Eastern and Western Europe respectively.\nThe [[Iron Curtain]] now separated the east under Moscow's control from the [[capitalist]] West. The United States launched the [[Marshall Plan]] from 1948\u201351 and [[NATO]] from 1949, and rebuilt industrial economies that all were thriving by the 1950s. France and [[West Germany]] took the lead in forming the [[European Economic Community]], which eventually became the [[European Union]] (EU). Secularization saw the weakening of Protestant and Catholic churches across most of Europe, except where they were symbols of anti-government resistance, as in Poland. The [[Revolutions of 1989]] brought an end to both Soviet hegemony and [[communism]] in Eastern Europe. Germany was reunited, [[Maastricht Treaty|Europe's integration deepened]], and both NATO and the EU expanded to the east. The EU came under increasing pressure because of the [[Great Recession|worldwide recession after 2008]].\n\n==Prehistory of Europe==\n{{Main|Prehistoric Europe|Palaeolithic Europe|Mesolithic Europe|Neolithic Europe|Stone Age|Bronze Age Europe|Iron Age Europe}}\n\n[[File:Europe Prehistory.gif|250px|thumb]]\n\n''[[Homo erectus]]'' migrated from Africa to Europe before the emergence of modern humans.

The origins of this culture can be located in the [[Levant]] (Ahmarian) and Hungary (first full Aurignacian). By 35,000 BC, the Aurignacian culture and its technology had extended through most of Europe. The last [[Neanderthals]] seem to have been forced to retreat during this process to the southern half of the [[Iberian Peninsula]].\n\nAround 29,000 BC a new technology/culture appeared in the western region of Europe: the [[Gravettian]]. This technology/culture has been theorised to have come with migrations of people from the [[Balkans]] (see [[Kozarnika]]).\n\nAround 16,000 BC, Europe witnessed the appearance of a new culture, known as [[Magdalenian]], possibly rooted in the old Gravettian. This culture soon superseded the [[Solutrean]] area and the Gravettian of mainly France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal and Ukraine. The [[Hamburg culture]] prevailed in Northern Europe in the 14th and the 13th millennium BC as the [[Creswellian]] (also termed the British Late Magdalenian) did shortly after in the British Islands.\nAround 12,500 BC, the [[W\u00fcrm glaciation]] ended. Slowly, through the following millennia, temperatures and sea levels rose, changing the environment of prehistoric people. Nevertheless, Magdalenian culture persisted until c. 10,000 BC, when it quickly evolved into two ''[[microlith]]ist'' cultures: [[Azilian]] ([[Federmesser]]), in Spain and southern France, and then [[Sauveterrian]], in southern France and [[Tardenoisian]] in Central Europe, while in Northern Europe the [[Lyngby culture|Lyngby complex]] succeeded the Hamburg culture with the influence of the [[Federmesser]] group as well. Evidence of permanent settlement dates from the 8th millennium BC in the Balkans.\n\nThe [[Indo-European migrations]] started at around c.\u20094200 BC. through the areas of the [[Black sea]] and the [[Balkan peninsula]] in [[Eastern Europe|East]] and [[Southeast Europe]].

Mycenaean civilization was dominated by a warrior [[aristocracy]]. Around 1400 BC, the Mycenaeans extended their control to Crete, the center of the Minoan civilization, and adopted a form of the Minoan script (called [[Linear A]]) to write their early form of [[Greek language|Greek]] in [[Linear B]].\n\nThe Mycenaean civilization perished with the [[Bronze Age collapse|collapse of Bronze-Age civilization]] on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea. The collapse is commonly attributed to the [[Dorian invasion]], although other theories describing natural disasters and climate change have been advanced as well.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Whatever the causes, the Mycenaean civilization had definitely disappeared after [[LH IIIC|LH III C]], when the sites of Mycenae and Tirynth were again destroyed and lost their importance. This end, during the last years of the 12th century BC, occurred after a slow decline of the Mycenaean civilization, which lasted many years before dying out. The beginning of the 11th century BC opened a new context, that of the protogeometric, the beginning of the geometric period, the ''[[Greek Dark Ages]]'' of traditional historiography.\n\n===Early antiquity period===\n{{Main|Classical antiquity}}\n\n[[File:Parthenon from south.jpg|thumb|The [[Parthenon]], an [[Ancient Athens|ancient Athenian]] Temple on the [[Acropolis]] (hill-top city) fell to Rome in 176 BC]]\n\nThe Greeks and the Romans left a legacy in Europe which is evident in European languages, [[Western philosophy|thought]], visual arts and law. Ancient Greece was a collection of city-states, out of which the original form of democracy developed. [[Classical Athens|Athens]] was the most powerful and developed city, and a cradle of learning from the time of [[Pericles]]. Citizens' forums debated and legislated policy of the state, and from here arose some of the most notable classical philosophers, such as [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]], the last of whom taught [[Alexander the Great]].\n\nThrough his military campaigns, the king of the kingdom of [[Macedon]], Alexander, spread Hellenistic culture and learning to the banks of the [[River Indus]]. Meanwhile, the [[Roman Republic]] strengthened through victory over [[Carthage]] in the [[Punic Wars]]. Greek wisdom passed into Roman institutions, as Athens itself was absorbed under the banner of the Senate and People of Rome \u2013 [[Senatus Populusque Romanus|SPQR]].\n\n[[File:Europe-In-301BC.png|thumb|Europe in the year 301 BC|left]]\n\nThe Romans expanded their domains from Anatolia in the east to Britannia in the west. In 44 BC as it approached its height, its dictator [[Julius Caesar]] was [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|murdered]] by senators in an attempt to restore the Republic. In the ensuing turmoil, [[Octavian]] (ruled as Augustus; and as ''divi filius'', or Son of God, as Julius had adopted him as an heir) usurped the reins of power and fought the Roman Senate. While proclaiming the rebirth of the Republic, he had ushered in the transfer of the Roman state from a republic to an empire, the [[Roman Empire]], which lasted for more than four centuries until the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]].\n\n====Ancient Greece====\n{{Main|Ancient Greece|Hellenistic period}}\n[[File:Napoli BW 2013-05-16 16-24-01.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Alexander Mosaic|mosaic]] showing [[Alexander the Great]] battling [[Darius III]]]]\n\nThe [[Hellenic civilisation]] was a collection of city-states or [[poleis]] with different governments and cultures that achieved notable developments in government, philosophy, science, mathematics, politics, sports, theatre and music.\n\nThe most powerful city-states were [[Ancient Athens|Athens]], [[History of Sparta|Sparta]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], and [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]. Athens was a powerful Hellenic city-state and governed itself with an early form of [[direct democracy]] invented by [[Cleisthenes]]; the citizens of Athens voted on legislation and executive bills themselves. Athens was the home of [[Socrates]],<ref>{{cite EB1911 |first=Henry |last=Jackson|wstitle=Socrates |volume=25 |page=331}}</ref> [[Plato]], and the [[Platonic Academy]].\n\nThe Hellenic city-states established colonies on the shores of the [[Black Sea]] and the Mediterranean ([[Asian Minor]], Sicily and Southern Italy in [[Magna Graecia]]). By the late 6th century BC, all the Greek [[city states]] in Asia Minor had been incorporated into the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], while the latter had made territorial gains in the [[Balkans]] (such as [[Macedon]], [[Thracians|Thrace]], [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonia]], etc.) and [[Eastern Europe]] proper as well. In the course of the 5th century BC, some of the Greek city states attempted to overthrow Persian rule in the [[Ionian Revolt]], which failed. This sparked the [[First Persian invasion of Greece|first Persian invasion of mainland Greece]]. At some point during the ensuing [[Greco-Persian Wars]], namely during the [[Second Persian invasion of Greece]], and precisely after the [[Battle of Thermopylae]] and the [[Battle of Artemisium]], almost all of Greece to the north of the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] had been overrun by the Persians,<ref name=\"Warfare in the Ancient World\">Brian Todd Carey, Joshua Allfree, John Cairns (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=3OSfBwAAQBAJ&pg=PT32 ''Warfare in the Ancient World''] Pen and Sword, {{ISBN|1-84884-630-4}}</ref> but the Greek city states reached a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Plataea]]. With the end of the Greco-Persian wars, the Persians were eventually decisively forced to withdraw from their territories in Europe. The Greco-Persian Wars and the victory of the Greek [[city states]] directly influenced the entire further course of European history and would set its further tone. Some Greek city-states formed the [[Delian League]] to continue fighting Persia, but Athens' position as leader of this league led Sparta to form the rival [[Peloponnesian League]]. The [[Peloponnesian War]]s ensued, and the Peloponnesian League was victorious. Subsequently, discontent with [[Spartan hegemony]] led to the [[Corinthian War]] and the defeat of Sparta at the [[Battle of Leuctra]]. At the same time at the north ruled the Thracian [[Odrysian Kingdom]] between the 5th century BC and the 1st century AD.\n\nHellenic infighting left Greek city states vulnerable, and [[Philip II of Macedon]] united the Greek city states under his control. The son of Philip II, known as [[Alexander the Great]], invaded neighboring [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]], toppled and incorporated its domains, as well as invading Egypt and going as far off as [[India]], increasing contact with people and cultures in these regions that marked the beginning of the [[Hellenistic period]].\n\nAfter the death of Alexander, his empire split into multiple kingdoms ruled by his generals, the [[Diadochi]]. The Diadochi fought against each other in a series of conflicts called the [[Wars of the Diadochi]]. In the beginning of the 2nd century BC, only three major kingdoms remained: the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Egypt]], the [[Seleucid Empire]] and [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]]. These kingdoms spread Greek culture to regions as far away as [[Bactria]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://explorethemed.com/Diadochi.asp?c=1 |title=The Diadochi and the Hellenistic Age |work=Historical Atlas of the Mediterranean |accessdate=2018-08-23 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cesare prima Gallia 58 a.C. jpg.jpg|thumb|The [[Roman republic]] and its neighbours in 58 BC.]]\n\n===Ancient Rome===\n====The rise of Rome====\n{{Main|Ancient Rome|Roman Republic|Roman Empire}}\n[[File:Cicer\u00f3n denuncia a Catilina, por Cesare Maccari.jpg|thumb|[[Cicero]] addresses the [[Roman Senate]] to denounce [[Catiline]]'s conspiracy to overthrow the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], by [[Cesare Maccari]]]]\n\nMuch of Greek learning was assimilated by the nascent Roman state as it expanded outward from Italy, taking advantage of its enemies' inability to unite: the only challenge to Roman ascent came from the [[Phoenicia]]n colony of [[Carthage]], and its defeats in the three [[Punic Wars]] marked the start of Roman [[hegemony]]. First governed by [[Roman kings|kings]], then as a senatorial republic (the [[Roman Republic]]), Rome finally became an empire at the end of the 1st century BC, under [[Augustus]] and his [[authoritarian]] successors.\n\n[[File:Europe-In-117AD.png|thumb|The Roman Empire at its greatest extent in 117 AD, under the emperor [[Trajan]]]]\n\nThe [[Roman Empire]] had its centre in the Mediterranean, controlling all the countries on its shores; the northern border was marked by the [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]] rivers.

[[Pax Romana]], a period of peace, [[Roman civilisation|civilisation]] and an efficient [[centralised government]] in the subject territories ended in the 3rd century, when a [[Crisis of the Third Century|series of civil wars]] undermined Rome's economic and social strength.\n\nIn the 4th century, the emperors [[Diocletian]] and [[Constantine I of the Roman Empire|Constantine]] were able to slow down the process of decline by splitting the empire into a Western part with a capital in Rome and an Eastern part with the capital in Byzantium, or [[Constantinople]] (now Istanbul). Whereas Diocletian severely persecuted Christianity, Constantine declared an official end to state-sponsored [[persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|persecution of Christians]] in 313 with the [[Edict of Milan]], thus setting the stage for the [[Christian Church|Church]] to become the [[state church of the Roman Empire]] in about 380.\n\n====Decline of the Roman Empire====\n{{Main|Decline of the Roman Empire|Crisis of the Third Century}}\n[[File:Partition of the Roman Empire in 395 AD.png|thumb|left|Map of the partition of the Roman Empire in 395, at the death of [[Theodosius I]]: the [[Western Roman Empire]] is shown in red and the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire)]] is shown in purple]]\n\nThe Roman Empire had been repeatedly attacked by invading armies from Northern Europe and in 476, Rome finally fell. [[Romulus Augustus]], the last [[Roman emperor|Emperor]] of the [[Western Roman Empire]], surrendered to the Germanic King [[Odoacer]]. The British historian [[Edward Gibbon]] argued in ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (1776) that the Romans had become decadent and had lost civic virtue.\n\nGibbon said that the adoption of Christianity meant belief in a better life after death, and therefore made people lazy and indifferent to the present. \"From the eighteenth century onward\", Glen W. Bowersock has remarked,<ref>Bowersock, \"The Vanishing Paradigm of the Fall of Rome\" ''Bulletin of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences'' '''49'''.8 (May 1996:29\u201343) p. 31.</ref> \"we have been obsessed with the fall: it has been valued as an archetype for every perceived decline, and, hence, as a symbol for our own fears.\" It remains one of the greatest historical questions, and has a tradition rich in scholarly interest.\n\nSome other notable dates are the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378, the death of [[Theodosius I]] in 395 (the last time the Roman Empire was politically unified), the crossing of the [[Rhine]] in 406 by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] after the withdrawal of the legions to defend Italy against [[Alaric I]], the death of [[Stilicho]] in 408, followed by the disintegration of the western legions, the death of [[Justinian I]], the last Roman Emperor who tried to reconquer the west, in 565, and the coming of Islam after 632. Many scholars maintain that rather than a \"fall\", the changes can more accurately be described as a complex transformation.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures |volume=A: To 1500 |author=Hunt, Lynn |author2=Thomas R.

See also the [[:File:World 820.png|map of the world in 820 AD]].]]\n\nWhen Emperor Constantine had reconquered Rome under the banner of the [[Christian cross|cross]] in 312, he soon afterwards issued the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313 (preceded by the [[Edict of Serdica]] in 311), declaring the legality of Christianity in the Roman Empire. In addition, Constantine officially shifted the capital of the Roman Empire from Rome to the Greek town of Byzantium, which he renamed Nova Roma \u2013 it was later named Constantinople (\"City of Constantine\").\n\nIn 395 [[Theodosius I]], who had made Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire, would be the last emperor to preside over a united Roman Empire. The empire was split into two halves: the [[Western Roman Empire]] centred in [[Ravenna]], and the Eastern Roman Empire (later to be referred to as the [[Byzantine Empire]]) centred in Constantinople. The Roman Empire was repeatedly attacked by [[Huns|Hunnic]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], [[Slavic people|Slavic]] and other \u201cbarbarian\u201d tribes (see: [[Migration Period]]), and in 476 finally the [[Western Roman Empire|Western part]] fell to the [[Heruli]] chieftain [[Odoacer]].\n\n[[File:Europa in 526.png|thumb|left|Map showing Europe in 526 AD with the three dominating powers of the west]]\n\nRoman authority in the Western part of the empire had collapsed, and a power vacuum left in the wake of this collapse; the central organization, institutions, laws and power of Rome had broken down, resulting in many areas being open to invasion by migrating tribes. Over time, [[feudalism]] and [[manorialism]] arose, two interlocking institutions that provided for division of land and labor, as well as a broad if uneven hierarchy of law and protection. These localised hierarchies were based on the bond of common people to the land on which they worked, and to a lord, who would provide and administer both local law to settle disputes among the peasants, as well as protection from outside invaders. Unlike under Roman rule, with its standard laws and military across the empire and its great bureaucracy to administer them and collect taxes, each lord (although having obligations to a higher lord) was largely sovereign in his domain. A peasant's lot could vary greatly depending on the leadership skills and attitudes to justice of the lord toward his people. [[Tithe]]s or rents were paid to the lord, who in turn owed resources, and armed men in times of war, to his lord, perhaps a regional prince. However, the levels of hierarchy were varied over time and place.\n\nThe western provinces soon were to be dominated by three great powers: first, the [[Franks]] ([[Merovingian dynasty]]) in [[Francia]] 481\u2013843 AD, which covered much of present France and Germany; second, the [[Visigothic kingdom]] 418\u2013711 AD in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] (modern Spain); and third, the [[Ostrogothic kingdom]] 493\u2013553 AD in [[Italy]] and parts of the western [[Balkans]] The Ostrogoths were later replaced by the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]] 568\u2013774 AD. These new powers of the west built upon the Roman traditions until they evolved into a synthesis of Roman and Germanic cultures. Although these powers covered large territories, they did not have the great resources and bureaucracy of the Roman empire to control regions and localities. The ongoing invasions and boundary disputes usually meant a more risky and varying life than that under the empire. This meant that in general more power and responsibilities were left to local lords. On the other hand, it also meant more freedom, particularly in more remote areas.\n\nIn Italy, [[Theodoric the Great]] began the cultural romanization of the new world he had constructed.

In 800, Charlemagne, reinforced by his massive territorial conquests, was crowned Emperor of the Romans (Imperator Romanorum) by [[Pope Leo III]], effectively solidifying his power in western Europe. Charlemagne's reign marked the beginning of a new Germanic Roman Empire in the west, the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Outside his borders, new forces were gathering. The [[Kievan Rus']] were marking out their territory, a [[Great Moravia]] was growing, while the [[Angles]] and the [[Saxons]] were securing their borders.\n\nFor the duration of the 6th century, the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] was embroiled in a series of deadly conflicts, first with the Persian [[Sassanid Empire]] (see [[Roman\u2013Persian Wars]]), followed by the onslaught of the arising Islamic [[Caliphate]] ([[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun]] and [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]]). By 650, the provinces of [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Palestine and Syria]] were lost to the [[Rashidun army|Muslim forces]], followed by [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Hispania]] and [[History of Islam in southern Italy|southern Italy]] in the 7th and 8th centuries (see [[Muslim conquests]]).

Others place it yet later in 476, when [[Romulus Augustulus]], traditionally considered the last western Emperor, was deposed, thus leaving sole imperial authority with the emperor in the [[Greek East]]. Others point to the reorganisation of the empire in the time of [[Heraclius]] (c. 620) when Latin titles and usages were officially replaced with Greek versions. In any case, the changeover was gradual and by 330, when Constantine inaugurated his new capital, the process of hellenization and increasing [[Christianisation]] was already under way. The Empire is generally considered to have ended after the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in 1453. The [[Plague of Justinian]] was a [[pandemic]] that afflicted the [[Byzantine Empire]], including its capital [[Constantinople]], in the years 541\u2013542.

Muslim [[Arabs]] first invaded historically Roman territory under [[Ab\u016b Bakr]], first Caliph of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], who entered [[Roman Syria]] and [[Roman Mesopotamia]]. As the Byzantines and neighboring [[Sasanids]] were severely weakened by the time, amongst the most important reason(s) being the protracted, centuries-lasting and frequent [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian wars]], which included the climactic [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628]], under [[Umar]], the second Caliph, the Muslims entirely toppled the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanid Persian Empire]], and decisively conquered Syria and Mesopotamia, as well as [[Roman Palestine]], [[Roman Egypt]], and parts of [[Asia Minor]] and [[Africa Province|Roman North Africa]].

They landed at [[Gibraltar]] on 30 April and worked their way northward. Tariq's forces were joined the next year by those of his Arab superior, [[Musa ibn Nusair]]. During the eight-year campaign most of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] was brought under Muslim rule \u2013 save for small areas in the northwest ([[Asturias]]) and largely [[Basque people|Basque]] regions in the [[Pyrenees]]. In 711, [[Visigothic]] [[Hispania]] was very weakened because it was immersed in a serious internal crisis caused by a war of succession to the throne involving two Visigoth suitors. The Muslims took advantage of the crisis within the [[Hispania|Hispano]]-[[Visigothic]] society to carry out their conquests. This territory, under the Arab name [[Al-Andalus]], became part of the expanding [[Umayyad]] empire.\n\nThe [[Siege of Constantinople (717\u2013718)|second siege of Constantinople]] (717) ended unsuccessful after the intervention of [[Tervel of Bulgaria]] and weakened the [[Umayyad|Umayyad dynasty]] and reduced their prestige. In 722 [[Don Pelayo]], a [[nobleman]] of Visigothic origin, formed an army of 300 [[Astures|Astur]] soldiers, to confront Munuza's Muslim troops. In the [[battle of Covadonga]], the Astures defeated the Arab-Moors, who decided to retire. The Christian victory marked the beginning of the [[Reconquista]] and the establishment of the [[Kingdom of Asturias]], whose first sovereign was Don Pelayo. The conquerors intended to continue their expansion in Europe and move northeast across the Pyrenees, but were defeated by the [[Frankish Empire|Frankish]] leader [[Charles Martel]] at the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] in 732.

The powerful [[Bulgarian Empire]] was the main rival of Byzantium for control of the [[Balkans]] for centuries and from the 9th century became the cultural centre of Slavic Europe. The [[First Bulgarian Empire|Empire]] created the [[Cyrillic script]] during the 9th century AD, at the [[Preslav Literary School]], and experienced the [[Golden Age of medieval Bulgarian culture|Golden Age]] of Bulgarian cultural prosperity during the reign of emperor [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I the Great]] (893\u2013927). Two states, [[Great Moravia]] and [[Kievan Rus']], emerged among the Slavic peoples respectively in the 9th century. In the late 9th and 10th centuries, northern and western Europe felt the burgeoning power and influence of the [[Viking]]s who raided, traded, conquered and settled swiftly and efficiently with their advanced seagoing vessels such as the [[longship]]s. The [[Invasion#Magyar invasions of Europe|Hungarians]] pillaged mainland Europe, the [[Pechenegs]] raided Bulgaria, Rus States and the [[Arab]] states. In the 10th century independent kingdoms were established in Central Europe including Poland and the newly settled [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Croatia (925\u20131102)|Croatia]] and [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbia]] also appeared in the [[Balkans]]. The subsequent period, ending around 1000, saw the further growth of [[feudalism]], which weakened the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nIn eastern Europe, [[Volga Bulgaria]] became an Islamic state in 921, after [[Alm\u0131\u015f I]] converted to Islam under the missionary efforts of [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]].<ref>Gerald Mako, \"The Islamization of the Volga Bulghars: A Question Reconsidered\", Archivum Eurasiae Medii Aevi 18, 2011, 199\u2013223.</ref>\n\nSlavery in the early medieval period had mostly died out in western Europe by about the year 1000 AD, replaced by [[serfdom]]. It lingered longer in England and in peripheral areas linked to the Muslim world, where slavery continued to flourish. Church rules suppressed slavery of Christians. Most historians argue the transition was quite abrupt around 1000, but some see a gradual transition from about 300 to 1000.<ref>Seymour Drescher and Stanley L. Engerman, eds.

In 1054, the [[East\u2013West Schism]], an insoluble split, occurred between the two remaining Christian seats in [[Catholic Church|Rome]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Constantinople]] (modern Istanbul).\n\nThe High Middle Ages of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries show a [[Medieval demography|rapidly increasing population]] of Europe, which caused great social and political change from the preceding era. By 1250, the robust population increase greatly benefited the economy, reaching levels it would not see again in some areas until the 19th century.<ref>John H. Mundy, ''Europe in the high Middle Ages, 1150\u20131309'' (1973) [https://archive.org/details/europeinhighmidd00mund online]</ref>\n\nFrom about the year 1000 onwards, Western Europe saw the last of the barbarian invasions and became more politically organized. The [[Viking]]s had settled in Britain, Ireland, France and elsewhere, whilst Norse Christian kingdoms were developing in their Scandinavian homelands. The [[Hungarian people|Magyars]] had ceased their expansion in the 10th century, and by the year 1000, the Roman Catholic [[Apostolic Kingdom]] of Hungary was recognised in central Europe. With the brief exception of the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongol invasions]], major barbarian incursions ceased.\n\n[[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] sovereignty was reestablished with the [[Uprising of Asen and Peter|anti-Byzantine uprising of the Bulgarians and Vlachs]] in 1185. The crusaders invaded the [[Byzantine empire]], captured Constantinople in 1204 and established their [[Latin Empire]]. [[Kaloyan of Bulgaria]] defeated [[Baldwin I, Latin Emperor|Baldwin I]], [[Latin emperor of Constantinople]], in the [[Battle of Adrianople (1205)|Battle of Adrianople]] on 14 April 1205. The reign of [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria]] led to maximum territorial expansion and that of [[Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria]] to a [[Architecture of the Tarnovo Artistic School|Second Golden Age of Bulgarian culture]]. The Byzantine Empire was fully reestablished in 1261.\n\nIn the 11th century, populations north of the [[Alps]] began to settle new lands, some of which had reverted to wilderness after the end of the [[Roman Empire]]. In what is known as the \"great clearances\", vast forests and marshes of Europe were cleared and cultivated. At the same time settlements moved beyond the traditional boundaries of the [[Frankish Empire]] to new frontiers in Europe, beyond the [[Elbe]] river, tripling the size of Germany in the process. Crusaders founded [[Crusader states|European colonies]] in the [[Levant]], the majority of the [[Reconquista|Iberian Peninsula was conquered]] from the Muslims, and the [[Normans]] colonised southern Italy, all part of the major population increase and resettlement pattern.\n\nThe High Middle Ages produced many different forms of intellectual, spiritual and [[Medieval art|artistic works]]. The most famous are the great cathedrals as expressions of [[Gothic architecture]], which evolved from [[Romanesque architecture]]. This age saw the rise of modern nation-states in Western Europe and the ascent of the famous Italian [[city-state]]s, such as [[Florence]] and [[Venice]]. The influential popes of the Catholic Church called volunteer armies from across Europe to a series of [[Crusades]] against the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq Turks]], who occupied the [[Holy Land]]. The rediscovery of the works of [[Aristotle]] led [[Thomas Aquinas]] and other thinkers to develop the philosophy of [[Scholasticism]].\n\n====A divided church====\n{{Main|East\u2013West Schism}}\n\nThe Great Schism between the Western (Catholic) and Eastern (Orthodox) Christian Churches was sparked in 1054 by [[Pope Leo IX]] asserting authority over three of the seats in the [[Pentarchy]], in Antioch, Jerusalem and Alexandria. Since the mid-8th century, the Byzantine Empire's borders had been shrinking in the face of Islamic expansion. [[Antioch]] had been wrested back into Byzantine control by 1045, but the resurgent power of the Roman successors in the West claimed a right and a duty for the lost seats in Asia and Africa. Pope Leo sparked a further dispute by defending the [[filioque]] clause in the [[Nicene Creed]] which the West had adopted customarily. The Orthodox today state that the XXVIIIth Canon of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] explicitly proclaimed the equality of the Bishops of Rome and Constantinople. The Orthodox also state that the Bishop of Rome has authority only over his own diocese and does not have any authority outside his diocese. There were other less significant catalysts for the Schism however, including variance over [[liturgy]]. The Schism of Roman Catholic and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] followed centuries of estrangement between the Latin and Greek worlds.\n\n====Holy wars====\n{{Main|Crusades|Reconquista}}\n[[File:SiegeofAntioch.jpeg|thumb|The [[Siege of Antioch]], from a medieval miniature painting, during the [[First Crusade]]]]\n\nAfter the [[East\u2013West Schism]], [[Western Christianity]] was adopted by the newly created kingdoms of Central Europe: [[Poland]], Hungary and [[Bohemia]]. The Roman Catholic Church developed as a major power, leading to conflicts between the Pope and Emperor. The geographic reach of the Roman Catholic Church expanded enormously due to the conversions of pagan kings (Scandinavia, [[Lithuania]], Poland, Hungary), the Christian [[Reconquista]] of [[Al-Andalus]], and the [[crusades]]. Most of Europe was Roman Catholic in the 15th century.\n\nEarly signs of the rebirth of civilization in western Europe began to appear in the 11th century as trade started again in Italy, leading to the economic and cultural growth of independent [[city-state]]s such as [[Venice#History|Venice]] and [[History of Florence|Florence]]; at the same time, nation-states began to take form in places such as France, England, Spain, and Portugal, although the process of their formation (usually marked by rivalry between the monarchy, the aristocratic feudal lords and the church) actually took several centuries. These new nation-states began writing in their own cultural vernaculars, instead of the traditional [[Latin]]. Notable figures of this movement would include [[Dante Alighieri]] and [[Christine de Pizan]] (born Christina da Pizzano), the former writing in Italian, and the latter, although an Italian (Venice), relocated to France, writing in French. (See [[Reconquista]] for the latter two countries.) Elsewhere, the [[Holy Roman Empire]], essentially based in Germany and Italy, further fragmented into a myriad of feudal principalities or small city states, whose subjection to the emperor was only formal.\n\nThe 14th century, when the [[Mongol Empire]] came to power, is often called the ''Age of the Mongols''. Mongol armies expanded westward under the command of [[Batu Khan]]. Their western conquests included almost all of Russia (save [[Novgorod]], which became a vassal),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/citd/RussianHeritage/4.PEAS/4.L/12.III.5.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20110427075859/https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/citd/RussianHeritage/4.PEAS/4.L/12.III.5.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 April 2011 |title=The Destruction of Kiev |publisher=Tspace.library.utoronto.ca |accessdate=17 May 2012 }}</ref> the [[Kipchak-Cuman Confederation]].

The [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword|Livonian Brothers]] of the Sword were defeated by the Lithuanians, so in 1237 Gregory IX merged the remainder of the order into the Teutonic Order as the [[Livonian Order]]. By the middle of the century, the Teutonic Knights completed their conquest of the Prussians before conquering and converting the Lithuanians in the subsequent decades. The order also came into conflict with the Eastern Orthodox Church of the [[Pskov Republic|Pskov]] and [[Novgorod Republic]]s. In 1240 the Orthodox Novgorod army defeated the Catholic Swedes in the [[Battle of the Neva]], and, two years later, they defeated the Livonian Order in the [[Battle on the Ice]]. The [[Union of Krewo]] in 1386, bringing two major changes in the history of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania: [[Christianization of Lithuania|conversion to Catholicism]] and establishment of a [[dynastic union]] between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]] marked both the greatest territorial expansion of the Grand Duchy and the defeat of the Teutonic Knights in the [[Battle of Grunwald]] in 1410.\n\n===Late Middle Ages===\n{{Main|Late Middle Ages|Lex mercatoria|Hundred Years' War|Fall of Constantinople}}\n[[File:Bubonic plague-en.svg|thumb|right|The spread of the \"Black Death\" from 1347 to 1351 through Europe]]\n\nThe Late Middle Ages spanned the 14th and early 15th centuries.<ref>Wallace K.

A series of famines and plagues, such as the [[Great Famine of 1315\u20131317]] and the [[Black Death]], killed people in a matter of days, reducing the population of some areas by half as many survivors fled. Kishlansky reports:\n:The Black Death touched every aspect of life, hastening a process of social, economic, and cultural transformation already underway....

There was also social unrest; France and England experienced serious peasant risings including the [[Jacquerie]] and the [[Peasants' Revolt]].

Collectively these events have been called the [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages]].<ref>Cantor, p. 480.</ref>\n\nBeginning in the 14th century, the [[Baltic Sea]] became one of the most important [[trade route]]s. The [[Hanseatic League]], an alliance of trading cities, facilitated the absorption of vast areas of Poland, [[Lithuania]], and [[Terra Mariana|Livonia]] into trade with other European countries. This fed the growth of powerful states in this part of Europe including Poland-Lithuania, Hungary, Bohemia, and Muscovy later on. The conventional end of the [[Middle Ages]] is usually associated with the fall of the city of [[Constantinople]] and of the [[Byzantine Empire]] to the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1453. The Turks made the city the capital of their [[Ottoman Empire]], which lasted until 1922 and included [[Egypt]], Syria, and most of the [[Balkans]]. The [[Ottoman wars in Europe]], also sometimes referred to as the Turkish wars, marked an essential part of the history of the continent as a whole.\n\n====Homicide rates plunge over 800 years====\nAt the local level, levels of violence were extremely high by modern standards in medieval and early modern Europe. Typically, small groups would battle their neighbors, using the farm tools at hand such as knives, sickles, hammers and axes. Mayhem and death were deliberate. The vast majority of people lived in rural areas. Cities were few, and small in size, but their concentration of population was conducive to violence.

From approximately 1200 AD through 1800 AD, homicide rates from violent local episodes declined by a factor of ten, from approximately 32 deaths per 1000 people to 3.2 per 1000. In the 20th century the homicide rate fell to 1.4 per 1000. Police forces seldom existed outside the cities; prisons only became common after 1800. Before then harsh penalties were imposed for homicide (severe whipping or execution) but they proved ineffective at controlling or reducing the insults to honor that precipitated most of the violence. The decline does not correlate with economics. Most historians attribute the trend in homicides to a steady increase in self-control of the sort promoted by Protestantism, and necessitated by schools and factories.<ref>Eisner, pp 127\u201332.</ref><ref>Helmut Thome, \"Explaining long term trends in violent crime.\" ''Crime, Histoire & Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s/Crime, History & Societies'' 5.2 (2001): 69\u201386 [https://journals.openedition.org/chs/738 online]</ref><ref>On the growing role of local government in reducing local feuds see Matthew H.

The period is characterised by the rise to importance of science and increasingly rapid [[History of technology|technological progress]], secularised civic politics and the [[nation state]]. [[capitalist economy|Capitalist economies]] began their rise. The early modern period also saw the rise and dominance of the economic theory of [[mercantilism]]. As such, the early modern period represents the decline and eventual disappearance, in much of the European sphere, of [[feudalism]], serfdom and the power of the Catholic Church. The period includes the [[Renaissance]], the [[Protestant Reformation]], the disastrous [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[European colonisation of the Americas]] and the [[European witch-hunts]].\n\n===Renaissance===\n{{Main|Renaissance}}\n[[File:Pacioli.jpg|250px|thumb|upright|''[[Portrait of Luca Pacioli]]'', the founder of accounting, by [[Jacopo de' Barbari]] ([[Museo di Capodimonte]]).]]\n\nDespite these crises, the 14th century was also a time of great progress within the arts and sciences. A renewed interest in ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] led to what has later been termed the [[Italian Renaissance]].\n\nThe Renaissance was a cultural movement that profoundly affected European intellectual life in the [[early modern period]]. Beginning in Italy, and spreading to the north, west and [[middle Europe]] during a cultural lag of some two and a half centuries, its influence affected literature, philosophy, art, politics, science, history, religion, and other aspects of intellectual enquiry.\n\nThe Italian [[Petrarch]] (Francesco di Petracco), deemed the first full-blooded Humanist, wrote in the 1330s: \"I am alive now, yet I would rather have been born in another time.\" He was enthusiastic about Greek and Roman antiquity. In the 15th and 16th centuries the continuing enthusiasm for the ancients was reinforced by the feeling that the inherited culture was dissolving and here was a storehouse of ideas and attitudes with which to rebuild. [[Matteo Palmieri]] wrote in the 1430s: \"Now indeed may every thoughtful spirit thank god that it has been permitted to him to be born in a new age.\" The renaissance was born: a new age where learning was very important.\n\nThe Renaissance was inspired by the growth in study of Latin and Greek texts and the admiration of the Greco-Roman era as a golden age. This prompted many artists and writers to begin drawing from Roman and Greek examples for their works, but there was also much innovation in this period, especially by multi-faceted artists such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. The Humanists saw their repossession of a great past as a Renaissance \u2013 a rebirth of civilization itself.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert A. Nisbet|title=History of the Idea of Progress|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QDRWfZ9Ydw0C&pg=PA103|year=1980|publisher=Transaction Publishers|page=103|isbn=978-1-4128-2548-1}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Francesco Melzi - Portrait of Leonardo - WGA14795.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452\u20131519), Italian polymath famed for the diversity of his talents.]]\n\nImportant political precedents were also set in this period. [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]]'s political writing in ''[[The Prince]]'' influenced later absolutism and real-politik. Also important were the many patrons who ruled states and used the artistry of the Renaissance as a sign of their power.\n\nIn all, the Renaissance could be viewed as an attempt by intellectuals to study and improve the secular and worldly, both through the revival of ideas from antiquity, and through novel approaches to thought \u2013 the immediate past being too \"Gothic\" in language, thought and sensibility.\n\n===Exploration and trade===\n[[File:Lisboa-Museu_Nacional_de_Arte_Antiga-Retrato_dito_de_Vasco_da_Gama-20140917.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Vasco da Gama]] discovered the sea route from Europe to India around Africa.]]\n{{Main|Age of Discovery}}\n[[File:Cantino Planisphere.jpg|thumb|[[Cantino planisphere]], 1502, earliest chart showing explorations by [[Vasco da Gama|Gama]], [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] and [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral|Cabral]]]]\n\nToward the end of the period, an era of discovery began. The growth of the [[Ottoman Empire]], culminating in the fall of Constantinople in 1453, cut off trading possibilities with the east. Western Europe was forced to discover new trading routes, as happened with Columbus' travel to the Americas in 1492, and [[Vasco da Gama]]'s circumnavigation of [[Indian subcontinent|India]] and Africa in 1498.\n\nThe numerous wars did not prevent European states from exploring and conquering wide portions of the world, from Africa to Asia and the newly discovered Americas. In the 15th century, Portugal led the way in geographical exploration along the coast of Africa in search of a maritime route to India, followed by Spain near the close of the 15th century, dividing their exploration of the world according to the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] in 1494.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kwabs.com/tordesillas_treaty.html |title=kwabs.com |publisher= |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215021/http://www.kwabs.com/tordesillas_treaty.html |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df= }}</ref> They were the first states to set up colonies in America and European [[factory (trading post)|trading posts (factories)]] along the shores of Africa and Asia, establishing the first direct European diplomatic contacts with Southeast Asian states in 1511, China in 1513 and Japan in 1542. In 1552, Russian tsar [[Ivan the Terrible]] conquered two major [[Tatar]] khanates, the [[Khanate of Kazan]] and the [[Astrakhan Khanate]]. The [[Yermak Timofeyevich|Yermak]]'s voyage of 1580 led to the annexation of the Tatar [[Siberian Khanate]] into Russia, and the Russians would soon after conquer the rest of [[Siberia]], steadily expanding to the east and south over the next centuries. Oceanic explorations soon followed by France, England and the Netherlands, who explored the Portuguese and Spanish trade routes into the Pacific Ocean, reaching Australia in 1606<ref>MacKnight, CC (1976). ''The Voyage to Marege: Macassan Trepangers in Northern Australia''. [[Melbourne University Publishing|Melbourne University Press]].</ref> and New Zealand in 1642.\n\n===Reformation===\n{{Main|Protestant Reformation}}\n[[File:95Thesen.jpg|left|thumb|[[The Ninety-Five Theses]] of German monk [[Martin Luther]], which criticized the Catholic Church]]\n[[File:Europe map 1648.PNG|left|thumb|350px|Map of Europe in 1648]]\n\nWith the development of the [[printing press]], new ideas spread throughout Europe and challenged traditional doctrines in science and theology. Simultaneously, the [[Protestant Reformation]] under German [[Martin Luther]] questioned Papal authority. The most common dating of the Reformation begins in 1517, when Luther published ''[[The Ninety-Five Theses]]'', and concludes in 1648 with the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] that ended years of [[European wars of religion|European religious wars]].<ref>Euan Cameron, ''The European Reformation'' (1991)</ref>\n\nDuring this period corruption in the Catholic Church led to a sharp backlash in the [[Protestant Reformation]]. It gained many followers especially among princes and kings seeking a stronger state by ending the influence of the Catholic Church. Figures other than [[Martin Luther]] began to emerge as well like [[John Calvin]] whose [[Calvinism]] had influence in many countries and King [[Henry VIII of England]] who broke away from the Catholic Church in England and set up the [[Anglican Church]]; his daughter [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] finished the organization of the church. These religious divisions brought on a wave of wars inspired and driven by religion but also by the ambitious monarchs in Western Europe who were becoming more centralised and powerful.\n\nThe Protestant Reformation also led to a strong reform movement in the Catholic Church called the [[Counter-Reformation]], which aimed to reduce corruption as well as to improve and strengthen Catholic dogma. Two important groups in the Catholic Church who emerged from this movement were the [[Jesuits]], who helped keep Spain, Portugal, Poland and other European countries within the Catholic fold, and the Oratorians of [[Saint Philip Neri]], who ministered to the faithful in Rome, restoring their confidence in the Church of Jesus Christ that subsisted substantially in the Church of Rome. Still, the Catholic Church was somewhat weakened by the Reformation, portions of Europe were no longer under its sway and kings in the remaining Catholic countries began to take control of the church institutions within their kingdoms.\n\nUnlike many European countries, the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and Hungary were more tolerant. While still enforcing the predominance of Catholicism, they continued to allow the large religious minorities to maintain their faiths, traditions and customs. The Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth became divided among Catholics, Protestants, Orthodox, Jews and a small Muslim population.\n\nAnother important development in this period was the growth of pan-European sentiments. Em\u00e9ric Cruc\u00e9 (1623) came up with the idea of the [[European Council]], intended to end wars in Europe; attempts to create lasting peace were no success, although all European countries (except the Russian and Ottoman Empires, regarded as foreign) agreed to make peace in 1518 at the [[Treaty of London (1518)|Treaty of London]]. Many wars broke out again in a few years. The Reformation also made European peace impossible for many centuries.\n\n[[File:Europe As A Queen Sebastian Munster 1570.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Europa regina]], 1570 print by [[Sebastian M\u00fcnster]] of [[Basel]]]]\n\nAnother development was the idea of 'European superiority'. The ideal of civilisation was taken over from the ancient Greeks and Romans: Discipline, education and living in the city were required to make people civilised; Europeans and non-Europeans were judged for their civility, and Europe regarded itself as superior to other continents. There was a movement by some such as [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] that regarded the non-Europeans as a better, more natural and primitive people. Post services were founded all over Europe, which allowed a [[Renaissance humanism|humanistic]] interconnected network of intellectuals across Europe, despite religious divisions. However, the Roman Catholic Church banned many leading scientific works; this led to an intellectual advantage for Protestant countries, where the banning of books was regionally organised. [[Francis Bacon]] and other advocates of science tried to create unity in Europe by focusing on the unity in nature.<sup>[[#Notes|1]]</sup> In the 15th century, at the end of the Middle Ages, powerful sovereign states were appearing, built by the [[New Monarchs]] who were centralising power in France, England, and Spain. On the other hand, the Parliament in the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] grew in power, taking legislative rights from the Polish king. The new state power was contested by parliaments in other countries especially England. New kinds of states emerged which were co-operation agreements among territorial rulers, cities, farmer republics and knights.\n\n[[File:Alberico Gentili.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alberico Gentili]], the Father of international law.]]\n\n===Mercantilism and colonial expansion===\n{{Main|Mercantilism}}\n[[File:Colonisation2.gif|thumb|left|Animated map showing the evolution of [[Colonial empire]]s from 1492 to the present]]\n\nThe [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] states (Spain and Portugal) were able to dominate [[New World]] (American) colonial activity in the 16th century. The [[Portuguese]] forged the first global empire in the 15th and 16th century, whilst during the 16th century and the first half of the 17th century, the Spanish under the crown of Castile became the most powerful global empire in the world. This dominance was increasingly challenged by [[British colonisation of the Americas|British]], [[French colonisation of the Americas|French]], and the short-lived [[New Netherland|Dutch]] and [[New Sweden|Swedish]] colonial efforts of the 17th and 18th centuries. New forms of trade and expanding horizons made new forms of [[Federalism|government]], [[Constitutionalism|law]] and economics necessary.\n\nColonial expansion continued in the following centuries (with some setbacks, such as successful wars of independence in the [[American Revolution|British American colonies]] and then later [[Haitian Revolution|Haiti]], [[Mexican War of Independence|Mexico]], [[Argentine War of Independence|Argentina]], [[Brazilian Independence|Brazil]], and [[Latin American wars of independence|others]] amid European turmoil of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]; Haiti unique in abolishing slavery). Spain had control of a large part of North America, all of Central America and a great part of South America, the Caribbean and the [[Philippines]]; Britain took the whole of Australia and New Zealand, most of India, and large parts of Africa and North America; France held parts of Canada and India (nearly all of which was lost to Britain [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|in 1763]]), [[French Indochina|Indochina]], large parts of Africa and the Caribbean islands; the Netherlands gained the [[Indies|East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]) and islands in the Caribbean; Portugal obtained Brazil and several territories in Africa and Asia; and later, powers such as Germany, Belgium, Italy and Russia acquired further colonies.\n\nThis expansion helped the economy of the countries owning them. [[Mercantilism|Trade]] flourished, because of the minor stability of the empires. By the late 16th century, American silver accounted for one-fifth of Spain's total budget.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Conquest in the Americas |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761575057_13/spain.html |work= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028035130/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761575057_13/Spain.html |archivedate=28 October 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> The European countries fought wars that were largely paid for by the money coming in from the colonies. Nevertheless, the profits of the [[Slave trade#The Americas|slave trade]] and of plantations of the [[West Indies]], then the most profitable of all the British colonies, amounted to less than 5% of the [[British Empire]]'s economy (but was generally more profitable) at the time of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the late 18th century.\n\n===Crisis of the 17th century===\n[[Image:Defenestration-prague-1618.jpg|thumb|Contemporary woodcut depicting the [[Second Defenestration of Prague]] (1618), which marked the beginning of the [[Bohemian Revolt]], which began the first part of the Thirty Years' War.]]\n{{further|The General Crisis}}\n\nThe 17th century was an era of crisis.<ref name=\"Geoffrey Parker and Lesley M.

In addition, there were secessions and upheavals in several parts of the Spanish empire, the world's first global empire. In Britain the entire Stuart monarchy (England, Scotland, Ireland, and its North American colonies) rebelled. Political insurgency and a spate of popular revolts seldom equalled shook the foundations of most states in Europe and Asia. More wars took place around the world in the mid-17th century than in almost any other period of recorded history. The crises spread far beyond Europe \u2013 for example Ming China, the most populous state in the world, collapsed. Across the Northern Hemisphere, the mid-17th century experienced almost unprecedented death rates. Geoffrey Parker, a British historian, suggests that environmental factors may have been in part to blame, especially global cooling.<ref>Geoffrey Parker, \"Crisis and Catastrophe: The Global Crisis of the Seventeenth Century Reconsidered,\" ''American Historical Review'' (2008) 113#4 pp. 1053\u201379.</ref><ref>J.B.

The expanding colonial frontiers resulted in a [[Commercial Revolution]]. The period is noted for the rise of modern science and the application of its findings to technological improvements, which animated the [[Industrial Revolution]] after 1750.\n\nThe Reformation had profound effects on the unity of Europe. Not only were nations divided one from another by their religious orientation, but some states were torn apart internally by religious strife, avidly fostered by their external enemies. France suffered this fate in the 16th century in the series of conflicts known as the [[French Wars of Religion]], which ended in the triumph of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon Dynasty]]. England avoided this fate for a while and settled down under [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] to a moderate [[Anglicanism]]. Much of modern-day Germany was made up of numerous small sovereign states under the theoretical framework of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which was further divided along internally drawn sectarian lines. The [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] is notable in this time for its [[religious tolerance|religious indifference]] and a general immunity to the horrors of European religious strife.\n\n====Thirty Years' War 1618\u20131648====\nThe [[Thirty Years' War]] was fought between 1618 and 1648, across Germany and neighbouring areas, and involved most of the major European powers except England and Russia.<ref>Peter H. Wilson, ''Europe's Tragedy: A History of the Thirty Years War'' (2009)</ref> Beginning as a religious conflict between Protestants and Catholics in [[Bohemia]], it quickly developed into a general war involving Catholics versus Protestants for the most part. The major impact of the war, in which [[mercenary]] armies were extensively used, was the devastation of entire regions scavenged bare by the foraging armies. Episodes of widespread famine and disease, and the breakup of family life, devastated the population of the German states and, to a lesser extent, the [[Low Countries]], the [[Crown of Bohemia]] and northern parts of Italy, while bankrupting many of the regional powers involved. Between one-fourth and one-third of the German population perished from direct military causes or from disease and starvation, as well as postponed births.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 649855|title = The Economic and Social Consequences of the Thirty Years' War|journal = Past & Present|volume = 39|issue = 39|pages = 44\u201361|last1 = Kamen|first1 = Henry|year = 1968|doi = 10.1093/past/39.1.44}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Herman Moll Map of Europe.jpg|thumb|left|After the [[Peace of Westphalia]], Europe's borders were still stable in 1708]]\nAfter the [[Peace of Westphalia]], which ended the war in favour of nations deciding their own religious allegiance, [[Political absolutism|absolutism]] became the norm of the continent, while parts of Europe experimented with constitutions foreshadowed by the [[English Civil War]] and particularly the [[Glorious Revolution]]. European military conflict did not cease, but had less disruptive effects on the lives of Europeans. In the advanced northwest, [[the Enlightenment]] gave a philosophical underpinning to the new outlook, and the continued spread of literacy, made possible by the [[printing press]], created new secular forces in thought.\n\n[[File:Map of Europe in 1794 Samuel Dunn Map of the World in Hemispheres.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Map of Europe in [[1794 Samuel Dunn Map of the World in Hemispheres|1794 Samuel Dunn Map of the World]]]]\nFrom the Union of Krewo (see above) central and eastern Europe was dominated by [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. In the 16th and 17th centuries Central and Eastern Europe was an arena of conflict for domination of the continent between [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]], the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth (involved in series of wars, like [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], [[Russo-Polish War (1654\u201367)|Russo-Polish War]], the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]], etc.) and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. This period saw a gradual decline of these three powers which were eventually replaced by new enlightened absolutist monarchies: Russia, Prussia and Austria (the Habsburg Monarchy). By the turn of the 19th century they had become new powers, having [[Partitions of Poland|divided Poland]] between themselves, with Sweden and Turkey having experienced substantial territorial losses to Russia and Austria respectively as well as pauperisation.\n\n====War of the Spanish Succession====\nThe [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701\u20131715) was a major war with France opposed by a coalition of England, the Netherlands, the Habsburg Monarchy, and Prussia. [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] commanded the English and Dutch victory at the [[Battle of Blenheim]] in 1704. The main issue was whether France under King Louis XIV would take control of Spain's very extensive possessions and thereby become by far the dominant power, or be forced to share power with other major nations. After initial allied successes, the long war produced a military stalemate and ended with the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], which was based on a balance of power in Europe. Historian [[Russell Weigley]] argues that the many wars almost never accomplished more than they cost.<ref>Russell Weigley,  ''The Age of Battles: The Quest for Decisive Warfare from Breitenfeld to Waterloo'' (1991).</ref> British historian [[G. M. Trevelyan]] argues:\n:That Treaty [of Utrecht], which ushered in the stable and characteristic period of Eighteenth-Century civilization, marked the end of danger to Europe from the old French monarchy, and it marked a change of no less significance to the world at large \u2013 the maritime, commercial and financial supremacy of Great Britain.<ref>G.M.

Frederick had a rationale based on Enlightenment thought: he fought total wars for limited objectives. The goal was to convince rival kings that it was better to negotiate and make peace than to fight him.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul M.

The Enlightenment flourished until about 1790\u20131800, at which point the Enlightenment, with its emphasis on reason, gave way to [[Romanticism]], which placed a new emphasis on emotion; a [[Counter-Enlightenment]] began to increase in prominence.

The French Revolution was by far the most momentous upheaval of the whole revolutionary age. It replaced the \"old regime\" with \"modern society,\" and at its extreme phase became very radical, so much so that all later revolutionary movements have looked back to it as a predecessor to themselves.... From the 1760s to 1848, the role of France was decisive.<ref>R.R. Palmer and Joel Colton, A History of the Modern World (5th ed. 1978), p. 341</ref>\n\nThe era of the French Revolution and the subsequent Napoleonic wars was a difficult time for monarchs. Tsar [[Paul I of Russia]] was assassinated; King [[Louis XVI of France]] was executed, as was his queen [[Marie Antoinette]]. Furthermore, kings [[Charles IV of Spain]], [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]] and [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden]] were deposed as were ultimately the Emperor Napoleon and all of the relatives he had installed on various European thrones. King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] and Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II of Austria]] barely clung to their thrones. [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III of England]] lost the better part of his empire.<ref>Steven Englund, ''Napoleon: A Political Life'' (2004) p. 388</ref>\n\nThe [[American Revolution]] (1775\u20131783) was the first successful revolt of a colony against a European power. It proclaimed, in the words of [[Thomas Jefferson]], that \"all men are created equal,\" a position based on the principles of the Enlightenment. It rejected aristocracy and established a [[Republicanism|republican form of government]] under [[George Washington]] that attracted worldwide attention.<ref>Gordon S.

After repeated failed attempts at financial reform, King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] had to convene the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]], a representative body of the country made up of three estates: the clergy, the nobility, and the commoners. The third estate, joined by members of the other two, declared itself to be a [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] and swore an [[Tennis Court Oath|oath]] not to dissolve until France had a constitution and created, in July, the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]]. At the same time the people of Paris revolted, famously storming the [[Bastille]] prison on 14 July 1789.\n\nAt the time the assembly wanted to create a [[constitutional monarchy]], and over the following two years passed various laws including the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], the [[Abolition of feudalism in France|abolition of feudalism]], and a [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy|fundamental change]] in the relationship between France and Rome. At first the king agreed with these changes and enjoyed reasonable popularity with the people. As anti-royalism increased along with threat of foreign invasion, the king tried to flee and join France's enemies. He was captured and on 21 January 1793, having been convicted of treason, he was guillotined.\n\nOn 20 September 1792 the [[National Convention]] abolished the monarchy and declared France a republic. Due to the emergency of [[French Revolutionary Wars|war]], the National Convention created the [[Committee of Public Safety]], controlled by [[Maximilien de Robespierre]] of the [[Jacobin Club]], to act as the country's executive. Under Robespierre, the committee initiated the [[Reign of Terror]], during which up to 40,000 people were executed in Paris, mainly nobles and those convicted by the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]], often on the flimsiest of evidence. Internal tensions at Paris drove the Committee towards increasing assertions of radicalism and increasing suspicions, fueling new terror: A few months into this phase, more and more prominent revolutionaries were being sent to the guillotine by Robespierre and his faction, for example [[Madame Roland]] and [[Georges Danton]]. Elsewhere in the country, counter-revolutionary [[war in the Vend\u00e9e|insurrections]] were brutally suppressed. The regime was overthrown in the [[Thermidorian Reaction|coup of 9 Thermidor]] (27 July 1794) and Robespierre was executed. The regime which followed ended the Terror and relaxed Robespierre's more extreme policies.\n\n[[File:Battle of Waterloo 1815.PNG|left|thumb|''[[The Battle of Waterloo (painting)|The Battle of Waterloo]]'', where [[Napoleon]] was defeated by the Seventh Coalition in 1815]]\n\n===Napoleon===\n[[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] was one of the world's most famous soldiers and statesmen, leading France to great victories over numerous European enemies. Despite modest origins he became Emperor and restructured much of European diplomacy, politics and law, until he was forced to abdicate in 1814. His 100-day comeback in 1815 failed at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], and he died in exile on a remote island, remembered as a great hero by many Frenchmen and as a great villain by British and other enemies.\n\nNapoleon, despite his youth, was France's most successful general in the Revolutionary wars, having conquered large parts of [[Italy]] and forced the Austrians to sue for peace. In 1799 on [[18 Brumaire]] (9 November) he overthrew the feeble government, replacing it with the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], which he dominated. He gained popularity in France by restoring the Church, keeping taxes low, centralizing power in Paris, and winning glory on the battlefield. In 1804 he crowned himself [[First French Empire|Emperor]]. In 1805, Napoleon planned to invade Britain, but a renewed British alliance with Russia and Austria ([[Third Coalition]]), forced him to turn his attention towards the continent, while at the same time the French fleet was demolished by the British at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], ending any plan to invade Britain. On 2 December 1805, Napoleon defeated a numerically superior Austro-Russian army at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], forcing Austria's withdrawal from the coalition (see [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]]) and dissolving the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. In 1806, a [[Fourth Coalition]] was set up. On 14 October Napoleon defeated the Prussians at the [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt]], marched through Germany and defeated the Russians on 14 June 1807 at [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]]. The [[Treaties of Tilsit]] divided Europe between France and Russia and created the [[Duchy of Warsaw]].\n\n[[File:Berezyna.jpg|thumb|Napoleon's army at the retreat from [[Russia]] at the [[Berezina]] river]]\n\nOn 12 June 1812 Napoleon [[French invasion of Russia|invaded Russia]] with a [[Grande Arm\u00e9e]] of nearly 700,000 troops. After the measured victories at [[Battle of Smolensk (1812)|Smolensk]] and [[Battle of Borodino|Borodino]] Napoleon occupied Moscow, only to find it burned by the retreating Russian army. He was forced to withdraw. On the march back his army was harassed by [[Cossacks]], and suffered disease and starvation. Only 20,000 of his men survived the campaign. By 1813 the tide had begun to turn from Napoleon. Having been defeated by a [[Sixth Coalition|seven nation army]] at the [[Battle of Leipzig]] in October 1813, he was forced to abdicate after the [[Six Days' Campaign]] and the occupation of Paris. Under the Treaty of Fontainebleau he was exiled to the island of [[Elba]]. He returned to France on 1 March 1815 (see [[Hundred Days]]), raised an army, but was finally defeated by a British and Prussian force at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] on 18 June 1815 and exiled to a small British island in the South Atlantic.\n\n====Impact of the French Revolution====\n{{main|Influence of the French Revolution}}\nRoberts finds that the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, from 1793 to 1815, caused 4 million deaths (of whom 1 million were civilians); 1.4 million were French deaths.<ref>Andrew Roberts, \"Why Napoleon merits the title 'the Great,'\" ''BBC History Magazine''  (1 November 2014)</ref>\n\nOutside France the Revolution had a major impact. Its ideas became widespread. Roberts argues that Napoleon was responsible for key ideas of the modern world, so that, \"meritocracy, equality before the law, property rights, religious toleration, modern secular education, sound finances, and so on-were protected, consolidated, codified, and geographically extended by Napoleon during his 16 years of power.\"<ref>Roberts, \"Why Napoleon merits the title 'the Great,\" ''BBC History Magazine''  (1 November 2014)</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the French armies in the 1790s and 1800s directly overthrew feudal remains in much of western Europe. They liberalised [[property law]]s, ended [[Manorialism|seigneurial dues]], abolished the [[guild]] of merchants and craftsmen to facilitate entrepreneurship, legalised divorce, closed the [[Ghetto|Jewish ghettos]] and made Jews equal to everyone else. The [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]] ended as did the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The power of church courts and religious authority was sharply reduced and [[Equality before the law|equality under the law]] was proclaimed for all men.<ref>Robert R. Palmer and Joel Colton,  ''A History of the Modern World'' (New York: McGraw Hill, 1995), pp. 428\u201329.</ref>\n\nIn foreign affairs, the French Army down to 1812 was quite successful. Roberts says that Napoleon fought 60 battles, losing only seven.<ref>Andrew Roberts, \"Why Napoleon merits the title 'the Great,\" ''BBC History Magazine''  (1 November 2014)</ref> France conquered Belgium and turned it into another province of France. It conquered the Netherlands, and made it a puppet state. It took control of the German areas on the left bank of the Rhine River and set up a puppet regime. It conquered Switzerland and most of Italy, setting up a series of puppet states. The result was glory for France, and an infusion of much needed money from the conquered lands, which also provided direct support to the French Army. However the enemies of France, led by Britain and funded by the inexhaustible British Treasury, formed a Second Coalition in 1799 (with Britain joined by Russia, the Ottoman Empire and Austria). It scored a series of victories that rolled back French successes, and trapped the French Army in Egypt. Napoleon himself slipped through the British blockade in October 1799, returning to Paris, where he overthrew the government and made himself the ruler.<ref>William Doyle, ''The Oxford History of the French Revolution'' (1989) pp. 341\u201368</ref><ref>Steven T. Ross, ''European Diplomatic History, 1789\u20131815: France Against Europe'' (1969)</ref>\n\nNapoleon conquered most of [[Italy]] in the name of the French Revolution in 1797\u201399. He consolidated old units and split up Austria's holdings. He set up a series of new republics, complete with new codes of law and abolition of old feudal privileges. Napoleon's [[Cisalpine Republic]] was centered on Milan; Genoa became a republic; the Roman Republic was formed as well as the small [[Ligurian Republic]] around Genoa. The [[Parthenopean Republic|Neapolitan Republic]] was formed around Naples, but it lasted only five months. He later formed the [[Kingdom of Italy]], with his brother as King. In addition, France turned the Netherlands into the [[Batavian Republic]], and Switzerland into the [[Helvetic Republic]]. All these new countries were satellites of France, and had to pay large subsidies to Paris, as well as provide military support for Napoleon's wars. Their political and administrative systems were modernized, the metric system introduced, and trade barriers reduced. Jewish ghettos were abolished. Belgium and Piedmont became integral parts of France.<ref>Alexander Grab, ''Napoleon and the Transformation of Europe'' (2003) pp. 62\u201365, 78\u201379, 88\u201396, 115\u201317, 154\u201359</ref>\n\nMost of the new nations were abolished and returned to prewar owners in 1814. However, Artz emphasizes the benefits the Italians gained from the French Revolution:\n:For nearly two decades the [[Italians]] had excellent codes of law, a fair system of taxation, a better economic situation, and more religious and intellectual toleration than they had known for centuries.... Everywhere old physical, economic, and intellectual barriers had been thrown down and the Italians had begun to be aware of a common nationality.<ref>Frederick B. Artz, ''Reaction and Revolution: 1814\u20131832 '' (1934) pp. 142\u201343</ref>\n\nLikewise in [[History of Switzerland|Switzerland]] the long-term impact of the French Revolution has been assessed by Martin:\n:It proclaimed the equality of citizens before the law, equality of languages, freedom of thought and faith; it created a Swiss citizenship, basis of our modern nationality, and the separation of powers, of which the old regime had no conception; it suppressed internal tariffs and other economic restraints; it unified weights and measures, reformed civil and penal law, authorized mixed marriages (between Catholics and Protestants), suppressed torture and improved justice; it developed education and public works.<ref>William Martin, ''Histoire de la Suisse'' (Paris, 1926), pp. 187\u201388, quoted in Crane Brinson, ''A Decade of Revolution: 1789\u20131799'' (1934) p. 235</ref>\n\nThe greatest impact came of course in France itself. In addition to effects similar to those in Italy and Switzerland, France saw the introduction of the principle of legal equality, and the downgrading of the once powerful and rich Catholic Church to just a bureau controlled by the government. Power became centralized in Paris, with its strong bureaucracy and an army supplied by conscripting all young men. French politics were permanently polarized \u2013 new names were given, \"left\" and \"right\" for the supporters and opponents of the principles of the Revolution.\n\nBritish historian Max Hastings says there is no question that as a military genius Napoleon ranks with Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar in greatness. However, in the political realm, historians debate whether Napoleon was \"an enlightened despot who laid the foundations of modern Europe or, instead, a megalomaniac who wrought greater misery than any man before the coming of Hitler\".<ref>Max Hastings,  \"Everything Is Owed to Glory,\" [https://www.wsj.com/articles/book-review-napoleon-a-life-by-andrew-roberts-1414788232?tesla=y&mod=WSJEUROPE_hpp_sections_ukintl&mg=reno64-wsj&url=https://www.wsj.com/article/SB12003192308051073864504580228211018002950.html?mod=WSJEUROPE_hpp_sections_ukintl ''Wall Street Journal '' 31 October 2014]</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n{{main|Christianity in the 19th century}}\nBy the 19th century, governments increasingly took over traditional religious roles, paying much more attention to efficiency and uniformity than to religiosity. Secular bodies took control of education away from the churches, abolished taxes and tithes for the support of established religions, and excluded bishops from the upper houses. Secular laws increasingly regulated marriage and divorce, and  maintaining   birth and death registers became the duty of local officials. Although the numerous religious denominations in the United States founded many colleges and universities, that was almost exclusively a state function across Europe.  Imperial powers protected Christian missionaries in African and Asian colonies.<ref>[[James Harvey Robinson]] and  [[Charles A. Beard]], \u2018\u2019The Development of Modern Europe Volume II The Merging of European into World History\u2019\u2019 (1930) v. 2 pp 88-89. [https://archive.org/details/developmentofmod007381mbp online]</ref> In France and other largely Catholic nations, anti-clerical political movements tried to reduce the role of the Catholic Church. Likewise briefly in Germany in the 1870s there was a fierce [[Kulturkampf]] (culture war) against Catholics, but the Catholics successfully fought back. The Catholic Church concentrated more power in the papacy and fought against secularism and socialism. It sponsored devotional reforms that gained wide support among the churchgoers.<ref>Kenneth Scott Latourette, ''Christianity in a Revolutionary Age, Volume I: The Nineteenth Century in Europe:  Background and the Roman Catholic Phase''  (1958) pp. 321-23, 370, 458-59, 464-66.</ref>\n====Protestantism==== \nHistorian [[Kenneth Scott Latourette]] argues that the outlook for Protestantism at the start of the 19th century was discouraging. It was a regional religion based in northwestern Europe, with an outpost in the sparsely settled United States. It was closely allied with government, as in Scandinavia, the Netherlands, Prussia, and especially Great Britain. The alliance came at the expense of independence, as the government made the basic policy decisions, down to such details as the salaries of ministers and location of new churches. The dominant intellectual currents of the Enlightenment promoted rationalism, and most Protestant leaders preached a sort of deism. Intellectually, the new methods of historical and anthropological study undermine automatic acceptance of biblical stories, as did the sciences of geology and biology. Industrialization was a strongly negative factor, as workers who moved to the city seldom joined churches. The gap between the church and the unchurched grew rapidly, and secular forces, based both in socialism and liberalism undermine the prestige of religion. Despite the negative forces, Protestantism demonstrated a striking vitality by 1900. Shrugging off Enlightenment rationalism, Protestants embraced [[romanticism]], with the stress on the personal and the invisible. Entirely fresh ideas as expressed by [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]], [[Soren Kierkegaard]], [[Albrecht Ritschl]] and [[Adolf von Harnack]] restored the intellectual power of theology. There was more attention to historic creeds such as the Augsburg, the Heidelberg, and the Westminster confessions. In England, Anglicans emphasize the historically Catholic components of their heritage, as the High Church element reintroduced vestments and incense into their rituals. The stirrings of [[pietism]] on the Continent, and [[evangelicalism]] in Britain expanded enormously, leading the devout away from an emphasis on formality and ritual and toward an inner sensibility toward personal relationship to Christ. Social activities, in education and in opposition to social vices such as slavery, alcoholism and poverty provided new opportunities for social service. Above all, worldwide missionary activity became a highly prized goal, proving quite successful in close cooperation with the imperialism of the British, German, and Dutch empires.<ref>Kenneth Scott Latourette, ''Christianity in a Revolutionary Age, II: The Nineteenth Century in Europe: The Protestant and Eastern Churches'' (1959) pp. 428\u201331</ref>\n\n===Nations rising===\n\n{{Main|International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)|Serbian Revolution|Italian unification||Revolutions of 1848|Greek War of Independence}}\n[[File:Maerz1848 berlin.jpg|thumb|right|Cheering the [[Revolutions of 1848]] in Berlin]]\n\n====Emerging nationalism====\n{{further|Nationalism}}\nThe political development of nationalism and the push for [[popular sovereignty]] culminated with the ethnic/national revolutions of Europe.

It achieved ''de facto'' independence in 1867 and finally gained recognition by the Great Powers in the [[Berlin Congress|Berlin Congress of 1878]].

Russia, as a World [[Great Power]] of fellow [[Eastern Orthodox Slavs|Orthodox Slavs]], could appeal to the [[Bulgarians]] in a way that Austria could not. An autonomous [[Bulgarian Exarchate]] was established for the dioceses of Bulgaria as well as those, wherein at least two thirds of Orthodox Christians were willing to join it. The [[April Uprising of 1876|April Uprising]] in 1876 indirectly resulted in the re-establishment of Bulgaria in 1878.\n\n====Poland====\n{{main|History of Poland}}\nThe cause of Polish nationalism was repeatedly frustrated before 1918. In the 1790s, Germany, Russia and Austria [[Partitions of Poland|partitioned Poland]]. Napoleon set up the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], a new Polish state that ignited a spirit of nationalism. Russia took it over in 1815 as [[Congress Poland]] with the tsar as King of Poland. Large-scale nationalist revolts erupted [[November Uprising|in 1830]] and [[January Uprising|1863\u201364]] but were harshly crushed by Russia, which tried to Russify the Polish language, culture and religion. The collapse of the Russian Empire in the First World War enabled the major powers to reestablish an independent Poland, which survived until 1939. Meanwhile, Poles in areas controlled by Germany moved into heavy industry but their religion came under attack by Bismarck in the [[Kulturkampf]] of the 1870s. The Poles joined German Catholics in a well-organized new [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], and defeated Bismarck politically. He responded by stopping the harassment and cooperating with the Centre Party.<ref>Richard Blanke, ''Prussian Poland in the German Empire (1871\u20131900)'' (1981)</ref><ref>Norman Davies, ''God's Playground: A History of Poland, Vol. 2: 1795 to the Present'' (2005).</ref>\n\n===Education===\nAn important component of nationalism was the study of the nation's heritage, emphasizing the national language and literary culture. This stimulated, and was in turn strongly supported by, the emergence of national educational systems reaching the general population. Latin gave way to the national language, and compulsory education, with strong support from modernizers and the media, became standard throughout Western countries. Voting reforms extended the franchise to the previously uneducated elements. A strong sentiment among the elites was the necessity for compulsory public education, so that the new electorate could understand and handle its duties. Every country developed a sense of national origins \u2013 the historical accuracy was less important than the motivation toward patriotism. Universal compulsory education was extended as well to girls, at least at the elementary level. By the 1890s, strong movements emerged in some countries, including France, Germany and the United States, to extend compulsory education to the secondary level.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ellwood Patterson Cubberley|title=The History of Education: Educational Practice and Progress Considered as a Phase of the Development and Spread of Western Civilization|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|url=https://archive.org/details/historyeducatio02cubbgoog|year=1920|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyeducatio02cubbgoog/page/n742 711]\u201323}}</ref>\n\n====Ideological coalitions====\n[[File:Bakunin speaking.png|thumb|upright=0.85|[[Mikhail Bakunin]] speaking to members of the [[International Workingmen's Association]] at the [[Basel Congress (1869)|Basel Congress]] in 1869]]\nAfter the defeat of revolutionary France, the other great powers tried to restore the situation which existed before 1789. In 1815 at the [[Congress of Vienna]], the major powers of Europe managed to produce a peaceful [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] among the various European empires. This was known as the [[Metternich]] system. The powerbase of their support was the aristocracy, with its great landed wealth and control of the government, the church, and the military in most countries. However, their efforts were unable to stop the spread of revolutionary movements: the middle classes had been deeply influenced by the ideals of the French revolution, and the [[Industrial Revolution]] brought important economical and social changes.<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Viereck|title=Conservative Thinkers: From John Adams to Winston Churchill|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qXxHHXwJT28C&pg=PA71|year=1978|pages=71\u201377|isbn=978-1-4128-2026-4}}</ref>\n\nRadical intellectuals looked to the working classes for a base for socialist, communist and [[anarchism|anarchistic]] ideas.

Aristocratic elements concentrated in government service, the military and the established churches. Nationalist movements (in Germany, Italy, Poland, Hungary, and elsewhere) called upon the \"racial\" unity (which usually meant a common language and an imagined common ethnicity) to seek national unification and/or liberation from foreign rule. As a result, the period between 1815 and 1871 saw a large number of revolutionary attempts and independence wars. Greece successfully revolted against Ottoman rule in the 1820s. European diplomats and intellectuals saw the Greek struggle for independence, with its accounts of Turkish atrocities, in a romantic light.<ref>{{cite book|author=Pamela Pilbeam|title=The Middle Classes in Europe, 1789\u20131914: France, Germany, Italy, and Russia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZkZdDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA240|year=1990|page=240|isbn=978-1-349-20606-3}}</ref>\n\n====France under Napoleon III====\n[[Napoleon III]], nephew of Napoleon I, returned to France from exile in 1848, bringing a famous name that promised to stabilize the chaotic political situation.

He was most famous for his aggressive foreign policy in Europe, Mexico, and worldwide.

Germany in particular increasingly dominated the continent in terms of economics and political power. Meanwhile, on a global scale, Great Britain, with its far-flung [[British Empire]], unmatched Royal Navy, and powerful bankers, became the world's first global power. The sun never set on its territories, while an informal empire operated through British financiers, entrepreneurs, traders and engineers who established operations in many countries, and largely dominated Latin America. The British were especially famous for financing and constructing railways around the world.<ref>Andrew Porter and William Roger Louis, eds.

With that accomplished by 1871 he then skillfully used [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] diplomacy to preserve Germany's new role and keep Europe at peace. He was removed from office in 1890 by an aggressive young Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], who pursued a disruptive foreign policy that polarized Europe into rival camps.

[[Austria-Hungary]] had the advantage of size, but multiple disadvantages. There were rivals on four sides, its finances were unstable, the population was fragmented into multiple ethnicities and languages that served as the bases for separatist nationalisms. It had a large army with good forts, but its industrial base was thin. Its naval resources were so minimal that it did not attempt to build an overseas empire. It did have the advantage of good diplomats, typified by [[Klemens von Metternich|Metternich (Foreign Minister 1809\u20131848, Prime Minister, 1821\u20131848))]]. They employed a grand strategy for survival that balanced out different forces, set up buffer zones, and kept the Habsburg empire going despite wars with the Ottomans, Frederick the Great, Napoleon and Bismarck, until the final disaster of the First World War. The Empire overnight disintegrated into multiple states based on ethnic nationalism and the principle of self-determination.<ref>{{cite book|author=A.

The initial impulse behind these dispersed maritime empires and those that followed was trade, driven by the new ideas and the capitalism that grew out of the [[Renaissance]]. Both the [[Portuguese Empire]] and [[Spanish Empire]] quickly grew into the first global political and economic systems with territories spread around the world.\n\nSubsequent major European colonial empires included the [[French colonial empire|French]], [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], and [[British Empire|British]] empires. The latter, consolidated during the period of British maritime hegemony in the 19th century, became the largest empire in history because of the improved ocean transportation technologies of the time as well as electronic communication through the telegraph, cable, and radio. At its height in 1920, the British Empire covered a quarter of the Earth's land area and comprised a quarter of its population. Other European countries, such as [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgium]], [[German colonial empire|Germany]], and [[Italian colonial empire|Italy]], pursued colonial empires as well (mostly in Africa), but they were smaller. Ignoring the oceans, Russia built its [[Russian Empire]] through conquest by land in Eastern Europe, and Asia.\n\nBy the mid-19th century, the [[Ottoman Empire]] had declined enough to become a target for other global powers (see [[History of the Balkans]]). This instigated the [[Crimean War]] in 1854 and began a tenser period of minor clashes among the globe-spanning empires of Europe that eventually set the stage for the [[First World War]]. In the second half of the 19th century, the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] carried out a series of wars that resulted in the creation of [[Italy]] and [[Germany]] as nation-states, significantly changing the balance of power in Europe. From 1870, [[Otto von Bismarck]] engineered a German hegemony of Europe that put France in a critical situation. It slowly rebuilt its relationships, seeking alliances with Russia and Britain to control the growing power of Germany. In this way, two opposing sides \u2013 the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance of 1882]] (Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy) and the [[Triple Entente|Triple Entente of 1907]] (Britain, France and Russia) \u2013 formed in Europe, improving their military forces and alliances year-by-year.\n\n[[File:Quarto Stato.jpg|thumb|[[The Fourth Estate (painting)]] by [[Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo]].]]\n==1914\u20131945: Two World wars==\n[[File:Map Europe alliances 1914-en.svg|thumb|320px|right|Military alliances leading to World War; Triple Entente in green; Central Powers in brown]]\n\nGerman-American historian [[Konrad Jarausch]], asked if he agreed that \"the European record of the past century [was] just one gigantic catastrophe\", argues:\n:It is true that the first half of the 20th century was full of internecine warfare, economic depression, ethnic cleansing and racist genocide that killed tens of millions of people, more than any other period in human history. But looking only at the disasters creates an incomplete perception, because the second half of the century witnessed a much more positive development in spite of the Cold War. After the defeat of Fascism in 1945, the peaceful revolution of 1989/90 also liberated the East from Communist control in a quite unexpected fashion. As a result, Europeans generally live more free, prosperous and healthy lives than ever before.<ref>See [http://press.princeton.edu/releases/m10427.html \"An Interview with Konrad H.

The First World War used modern technology to kill millions of soldiers. Victory by Britain, France, the United States and other allies drastically changed the map of Europe, ending four major land empires (the Russian, German, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires) and leading to the creation of nation-states across Central and Eastern Europe. The [[October Revolution]] in Russia led to the creation of the [[Soviet Union]] (1917\u20131991) and the rise of the international communist movement. Widespread economic prosperity was typical of the period before 1914, and 1920\u20131929. After the onset of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929, however, democracy collapsed in most of Europe. Fascists took control in Italy, and the even more aggressive Nazi movement led by Adolf Hitler took control of Germany, 1933\u201345. The Second World War was fought on an even larger scale than the First war, killing many more people, and using even more advanced technology. It ended with the division of Europe between East and West, with the East under the control of the Soviet Union and the West dominated by NATO. The two sides engaged in the [[Cold War]], with actual conflict taking place not in Europe but in Asia in the Korean War and the Vietnam War. The Imperial system collapsed. The remaining [[colonial empire]]s ended through the [[decolonisation]] of European rule in Africa and Asia. The fall of Soviet Communism (1989\u20131991) left the West dominant and enabled the [[reunification of Germany]]. It accelerated the process of a [[European integration]] to include Eastern Europe. The European Union continues today, but with German economic dominance. Since the worldwide Great Recession of 2008, European growth has been slow, and financial crises have hit Greece and other countries. While Russia is a weak version of the old Soviet Union, it has been confronting Europe in Ukraine and other areas.\n\n===World War I===\n{{Main|World War I|Home front during World War I|Diplomatic history of World War I|Economic history of World War I}}\n[[File:trencheswwi2.jpg|thumb|Trenches and sand bags were defences against machine guns and artillery on the Western Front, 1914\u20131918]]\n\nAfter the relative peace of most of the 19th century, the rivalry between European powers, compounded by a rising nationalism among ethnic groups, exploded in August 1914, when the [[First World War]] started.<ref>Brian Bond,  \"The First World War\" in [[C.L.

The Western Front involved especially brutal combat without any territorial gains by either side. Single battles like Verdun and the Somme killed hundreds of thousands of men while leaving the stalemate unchanged. Heavy artillery and machine guns caused most of the casualties, supplemented by poison gas. Czarist Russia collapsed in the [[February Revolution]] of 1917 and Germany claimed victory on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]]. After eight months of liberal rule, the [[October Revolution]] brought [[Vladimir Lenin]] and the Bolsheviks to power, leading to the creation of the Soviet Union in place of the disintegrated Russian Empire. With American entry into the war in 1917 on the Allied side, and the failure of Germany's spring 1918 offensive, Germany had run out of manpower, while an average of 10,000 American troops were arriving in France every day in the summer of 1918.

Historian [[Stanley G.

Big business, industry, and finance retained extensive autonomy, particularly in the early years. The armed forces also enjoyed considerable autonomy....The Fascist militia was placed under military control....The judicial system was left largely intact and relatively autonomous as well. The police continued to be directed by state officials and were not taken over by party leaders...nor was a major new police elite created....There was never any question of bringing the Church under overall subservience.... Sizable sectors of Italian cultural life retained extensive autonomy, and no major state propaganda-and-culture ministry existed....The Mussolini regime was neither especially sanguinary nor particularly repressive.<ref>{{cite book|author=Stanley G.

In most of Europe, as well as in Japan and most of Latin America, nation after nation turned to dictators and authoritarian regimes. The most momentous change of government came when Hitler and his Nazis took power in Germany in 1933. The main institution that was meant to bring stability was the [[League of Nations]], created in 1919. However the League failed to resolve any major crises and by 1938 it was no longer a major player. The League was undermined by the bellicosity of [[Nazi Germany]], [[Imperial Japan]], the Soviet Union, and [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's]] Italy, and by the non-participation of the United States. By 1937 it was largely ignored.<ref>F.P. Walters, ''A History of the League of Nations'' (Oxford UP, 1965).

The League of Nations was helpless as Italy conquered Ethiopia and Japan seized Manchuria in 1931 and took over most of China starting in 1937.<ref>David Clay Large, ''Between Two Fires: Europe's Path in the 1930s'' (1991)</ref>\n[[File:Milicianas CNT-FAI.png|thumb|200px|[[Federaci\u00f3n Anarquista Ib\u00e9rica|FAI]] milicia during [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Social Revolution]].]]\nThe [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936\u20131939) was marked by numerous small battles and sieges, and many atrocities, until the rebels (the Nationalists), led by [[Francisco Franco]], won in 1939. There was military intervention as Italy sent land forces, and Germany sent smaller elite air force and armoured units to the Nationalists. The Soviet Union sold armaments to the leftist Republicans on the other side, while the Communist parties in numerous countries sent soldiers to the \"[[International Brigades]].\" The civil war did not escalate into a larger conflict, but did become a worldwide ideological battleground that pitted the left, the communist movement and many liberals against Catholics, conservatives, and fascists. Britain, France and the US remained neutral and refused to sell military supplies to either side. Worldwide there was a decline in pacifism and a growing sense that another world war was imminent, and that it would be worth fighting for.<ref>Stanley G.

It did not. In 1939 Germany took over the rest of Czechoslovakia and appeasement policies gave way to hurried rearmament as Hitler next turned his attention to Poland.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv N 1576 Bild-003, Warschau, Bettelnde Kinder.jpg|right|thumb|Starving Jewish children in [[Warsaw Ghetto]] (1940\u20131943).]]\n[[File:Warsaw_1944.jpg|right|thumb|The fight against German Nazis during the [[Warsaw Uprising]] in 1944.]]\n[[File:AmericanAndSovietAtElbe.jpg|right|thumb|American and Soviet troops [[Elbe Day|meet in April 1945]], east of the [[Elbe River]].]]\n\nAfter allying with Japan in the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] and then also with [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Italy]] in the \"[[Pact of Steel]]\", and finally signing a [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|non-aggression treaty]] with the Soviet Union in August 1939, Hitler launched the [[Second World War]] on 1 September 1939 by attacking Poland. To his surprise Britain and France declared war on Germany, but there was little fighting during the \"Phoney War\" period. War began in earnest in spring 1940 with the successful Blitzkrieg conquests of Denmark, Norway, the Low Countries, and France. Britain remained alone but refused to negotiate, and defeated Germany's air attacks in the [[Battle of Britain]]. Hitler's goal was to control Eastern Europe but because of his failure to defeat Britain and the Italian failures in North Africa and the Balkans, the great attack on the Soviet Union was delayed until June 1941. Despite initial successes, the German army was stopped close to Moscow in December 1941.<ref>I.C.B. Dear and M.R.D. Foot, eds., ''The Oxford Companion to World War II'' (1995) covers every country and major campaign.</ref>\n\nOver the next year the tide was turned and the Germans started to suffer a series of defeats, for example in the siege of [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] and at [[Battle of Kursk|Kursk]]. Meanwhile, Japan (allied to Germany and Italy since September 1940) attacked Britain and the United States on 7 December 1941; Germany then completed its over-extension by declaring war on the United States. War raged between the Axis Powers (Germany, Italy, and Japan) and the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] (British Empire, Soviet Union, and the United States). The Allied Forces won in North Africa, invaded Italy in 1943, and recaptured France in 1944. In the spring of 1945 Germany itself was invaded from the east by the Soviet Union and from the west by the other Allies. As the Red Army conquered the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]] in Berlin, Hitler committed suicide and Germany surrendered in early May.<ref>Norman Davies, ''No Simple Victory: World War II in Europe, 1939\u20131945'' (2008)</ref> World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history, causing [[World War II casualties|between 50 and 80 million deaths]], the majority of whom were civilians (approximately 38 to 55 million).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://necrometrics.com/20c5m.htm |title=Second''Second Source List and Detailed Death Tolls for the Twentieth Century Hemoclysm'' |publisher=Users.erols.com |accessdate=2 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nThis period was also marked by systematic genocide.

The United States and the majority of European liberal democracies at the time (United Kingdom, France, Italy, Netherlands, West Germany etc.) established the [[NATO]] military alliance. Later, the Soviet Union and its satellites (Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, [[East Germany]], Hungary, Poland, and Romania) in 1955 established the [[Warsaw Pact]] as a counterpoint to NATO. The Warsaw Pact had a much larger ground force, but the American-French-British nuclear umbrellas protected NATO.\n\n[[Communist state]]s were imposed by the Red Army in the East, while parliamentary democracy became the dominant form of government in the West. Most historians point to its success as the product of exhaustion with war and dictatorship, and the promise of continued economic prosperity. Martin Conway also adds that an important impetus came from the anti-Nazi wartime political coalitions.<ref>Martin Conway, \"The Rise and Fall of Western Europe's Democratic Age, 1945\u2013\u20131973,\" ''Contemporary European History'' (2004) 13#1 pp. 67\u201388.</ref>\n\n===Economic recovery===\n{{Main|Marshall Plan|European Economic Community}}\nThe United States gave away about $20 billion in [[Marshall Plan]] grants and other grants and low-interest long-term loans to Western Europe, 1945 to 1951. Historian Michael J. Hogan argues that American aid was critical in stabilizing the economy and politics of Western Europe. It brought in modern management that dramatically increased productivity, and encouraged cooperation between labor and management, and among the member states. Local Communist parties were opposed, and they lost prestige and influence and a role in government. In strategic terms, says Hogan, the Marshall Plan strengthened the West against The possibility of a Communist invasion or political takeover.<ref>Michael J. Hogan, ''The Marshall Plan: America, Britain and the Reconstruction of Western Europe, 1947\u20131952'' (1989)  pp. 26\u201328, 430\u201343.</ref> However, the Marshall Plan's role in the rapid recovery has been debated. Most reject the idea that it only miraculously revived Europe, since the evidence shows that a general recovery was already under way thanks to other aid programs from the United States. Economic historians Bradford De Long and [[Barry Eichengreen]] conclude it was, \" History's Most Successful Structural Adjustment Program.\" They state:\n:It was not large enough to have significantly accelerated recovery by financing investment, aiding the reconstruction of damaged infrastructure, or easing commodity bottlenecks. We argue, however, that the Marshall Plan did play a major role in setting the stage for post-World War II Western Europe's rapid growth. The conditions attached to Marshall Plan aid pushed European political economy in a direction that left its post World War II \"mixed economies\" with more \"market\" and less \"controls\" in the mix.<ref>{{cite book |first=J.

It seized and transferred most of Germany's industrial plants and it exacted war reparations from East Germany, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, using Soviet-dominated joint enterprises. It used trading arrangements deliberately designed to favor the Soviet Union. Moscow controlled the Communist parties that ruled the satellite states, and they followed orders from the Kremlin. Historian Mark Kramer concludes:\n:The net outflow of resources from eastern Europe to the Soviet Union was approximately $15 billion to $20 billion in the first decade after World War II, an amount roughly equal to the total aid provided by the United States to western Europe under the Marshall Plan.<ref>Mark Kramer, \"The Soviet Bloc and the Cold War in Europe,\" {{cite book|author=Klaus Larresm ed.|title=A Companion to Europe Since 1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EyNcCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT174|year=2014|publisher=Wiley|page=79|isbn=978-1-118-89024-0}}</ref>\n\nWestern Europe began economic and then political integration, with the aim to unite the region and defend it. This process included organisations such as the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which grew and evolved into the [[European Union]], and the [[Council of Europe]]. The [[Solidarno\u015b\u0107]] movement in the 1980s weakened the Communist government in Poland. At the time the Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] initiated [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]], which weakened Soviet influence in Europe, particularly in the USSR. In 1989 the Berlin Wall came down and Communist governments outside the Soviet Union were deposed. In 1990 the Federal Republic of Germany absorbed East Germany, after making large cash payments to the USSR. In 1991 the Communist Party in Moscow collapsed, [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|ending the USSR]], which split into fifteen independent states. The largest, Russia, took the Soviet Union's seat on the [[United Nations Security Council]]. The most violent dissolution happened in [[Yugoslavia]], in the Balkans. Four ([[Slovenia]], Croatia, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[North Macedonia]]) out of six Yugoslav republics declared independence and for most of them a violent war ensued, in some parts lasting until 1995. In 2006 Montenegro seceded and became an independent state. In the post\u2013Cold War era, NATO and the EU have been gradually admitting most of the former members of the Warsaw Pact.\n\nLooking at the half century after the war historian [[Walter Laqueur|Walter Lacquer]] concluded:\n:\"The postwar generations of European elites aimed to create more democratic societies. They wanted to reduce the extremes of wealth and poverty and provide essential social services in a way that prewar generations had not. They had had quite enough of unrest and conflict. For decades many Continental societies had more or less achieved these aims and had every reason to be proud of their progress. Europe was quiet and civilized. Europe's success was based on recent painful experience: the horrors of two world wars; the lessons of dictatorship; the experiences of fascism and communism. Above all, it was based on a feeling of European identity and common values \u2013 or so it appeared at the time.\"<ref>Walter Laqueur, \"The Slow Death of Europe\", ''The National Interest'' [http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/why-the-euro-the-least-europes-worries-5767 16 August 2011 online]</ref>\n\nThe post-war period also witnessed a significant rise in the standard of living of the Western European working class.

They had obsolescent heavy industry, and suddenly had to pay very high energy prices which caused sharp inflation. Some of them also had inefficient nationalized railways and heavy industries. In the important field of computer technology, European nations lagged behind the United States. They also faced high government deficits and growing unrest led by militant labour unions. There was an urgent need for new economic directions. Germany and Sweden sought to create a social consensus behind a gradual restructuring. Germany's efforts proved highly successful. In Britain under the leadership of [[Margaret Thatcher]], the solution was shock therapy, high interest rates, austerity, and selling off inefficient corporations as well as the public housing, which was sold off to the tenants. One result was escalating social tensions in Britain, led by the militant coal miners. Thatcher eventually defeated her opponents and radically changed the British economy, but the controversy never went away as shown by the hostile demonstrations at the time of her death in 2013.<ref>David Priestland, \"Margaret Thatcher?\" \u2018\u2019BBC History Magazine\u2019\u2019 1 May 2013</ref>\n\n==Recent history==\n{{Further |Cold War (1979\u20131985)|History of the European Union}}\n\n[[File:Thefalloftheberlinwall1989.JPG|thumb|right|Germans standing on top of the [[Berlin Wall]] at the [[Brandenburg Gate]], November 1989; it would begin to be torn apart in the following days.]]\n[[File:Cold War border changes.png|thumb|upright=1.182|Changes in national boundaries after the end of the Cold War]]\n\nThe ending of the Cold War came in a rush of events in 1979 to 1991, chiefly in Eastern Europe, that brought the end of the Soviet control over its East European satellites and its world network of communist parties (1989) and ending with the final splitting up of the Soviet Union in 1991 into 15 non-communist states. Italian historian Federico Romero reports that observers at the time emphasized that,:\n:The systemic and ideological confrontation between capitalism and communism had faded away. The geopolitical partition of Europe was no more. Nuclear deterrence was morphing into a less armed, almost hypothetical version of its previous self. Superpower rivalry was rapidly wound up with cascading effects in various areas of the world.<ref>Federico Romero, ''Cold War historiography at the crossroads,\" ''Cold War History'' (2014), 14:4, 685\u2013703, {{DOI| 10.1080/14682745.2014.950249}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the end of the Cold War, the [[European Economic Community]] pushed for closer integration, co-operation in foreign and home affairs, and started to increase its membership into the neutral and former communist countries. In 1993, the [[Maastricht Treaty]] established the [[European Union]], succeeding the EEC and furthering political co-operation. The neutral countries of Austria, Finland and Sweden acceded to the EU, and those that didn't join were tied into the EU's economic market via the [[European Economic Area]]. These countries also entered the [[Schengen Agreement]] which lifted border controls between member states.<ref name=\"Europa History 90-99\">{{cite web |title=A Europe without frontiers |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/1990-1999/index_en.htm |accessdate=25 June 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe Maastricht Treaty created a single currency for most EU members.

Found in drier regions across much of the continent, it inhabits [[shrubland|scrub]] and open [[woodland]]. Like many brightly coloured robins of the family [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|10.5|\u2013|12.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, the robin has a small, thin, black bill, and dark brown eyes and legs. The male has a distinctive red cap and red breast, black upperparts, and a black tail with white tips. The underparts and shoulders are white. The female is an undistinguished grey-brown. This species uses a variety of songs, and males generally sing to [[territory (animal)|advertise territories]] and attract females. Birds are encountered in pairs or small groups, but the social behaviour has been little studied.\n\nThe position of the red-capped robin is unclear; it and its relatives are unrelated to [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin|American]] robins, but they appear to be an early offshoot of the [[songbird]] infraorder [[Passerida]]. The red-capped robin is a predominantly ground-feeding bird, and its prey consists of [[insect]]s and [[spider]]s. Although widespread, it is uncommon in much of its range and has receded in some areas from human activity.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe red-capped robin was described by [[Nicholas Aylward Vigors]] and [[Thomas Horsfield]] in 1827, having been collected in the northern [[Spencer Gulf]] in [[South Australia]]. They named it ''Muscicapa goodenovii'',<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Vigors, Nicholas A. |author2=Horsfield, Thomas |year=1827 |title=A description of the Australian birds in the collection of the Linnean Society; with an attempt at arranging them according to their natural affinities |journal=Transactions of the Linnean Society of London |volume=15 |pages=170\u2013331 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.1826.tb00115.x}}[245]</ref><!-- cites previous clause and sentence before it --> and placed it among the [[Old World flycatcher]] family [[Muscicapidae]].<ref name=\"Boles, p. xv\">Boles, p. xv.</ref> The [[specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]] ''goodenovii'' honours the Reverend [[Samuel Goodenough]], [[Bishop of Carlisle]] and first treasurer of the [[Linnean Society of London|Linnean Society]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Every Australian Bird Illustrated |editor=Wade, Paul |year=1977 |page=217 |publisher=Rigby |isbn=0-7270-0009-8}}</ref>\n\nThe red-capped robin was later moved to the genus ''[[Petroica]]''. The generic name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''petros'' 'rock' and ''oikos'' 'home', from the bird's habit of sitting on rocks.<ref>Boles, p. 66.</ref> Within the genus, it is one of five red- or pink-breasted species colloquially known as \"red robins\", as distinct from the \"yellow robins\" of the genus ''[[Eopsaltria]]''.

Found in drier regions across much of the continent, it inhabits [[shrubland|scrub]] and open [[woodland]]. Like many brightly coloured robins of the family [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|10.5|\u2013|12.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, the robin has a small, thin, black bill, and dark brown eyes and legs. The male has a distinctive red cap and red breast, black upperparts, and a black tail with white tips. The underparts and shoulders are white. The female is an undistinguished grey-brown. This species uses a variety of songs, and males generally sing to [[territory (animal)|advertise territories]] and attract females. Birds are encountered in pairs or small groups, but the social behaviour has been little studied.\n\nThe position of the red-capped robin is unclear; it and its relatives are unrelated to [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin|American]] robins, but they appear to be an early offshoot of the [[songbird]] infraorder [[Passerida]]. The red-capped robin is a predominantly ground-feeding bird, and its prey consists of [[insect]]s and [[spider]]s. Although widespread, it is uncommon in much of its range and has receded in some areas from human activity.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe red-capped robin was described by [[Nicholas Aylward Vigors]] and [[Thomas Horsfield]] in 1827, having been collected in the northern [[Spencer Gulf]] in [[South Australia]]. They named it ''Muscicapa goodenovii'',<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Vigors, Nicholas A. |author2=Horsfield, Thomas |year=1827 |title=A description of the Australian birds in the collection of the Linnean Society; with an attempt at arranging them according to their natural affinities |journal=Transactions of the Linnean Society of London |volume=15 |pages=170\u2013331 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.1826.tb00115.x}}[245]</ref><!-- cites previous clause and sentence before it --> and placed it among the [[Old World flycatcher]] family [[Muscicapidae]].<ref name=\"Boles, p. xv\">Boles, p. xv.</ref> The [[specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]] ''goodenovii'' honours the Reverend [[Samuel Goodenough]], [[Bishop of Carlisle]] and first treasurer of the [[Linnean Society of London|Linnean Society]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Every Australian Bird Illustrated |editor=Wade, Paul |year=1977 |page=217 |publisher=Rigby |isbn=0-7270-0009-8}}</ref>\n\nThe red-capped robin was later moved to the genus ''[[Petroica]]''. The generic name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''petros'' 'rock' and ''oikos'' 'home', from the bird's habit of sitting on rocks.<ref>Boles, p. 66.</ref> Within the genus, it is one of five red- or pink-breasted species colloquially known as \"red robins\", as distinct from the \"yellow robins\" of the genus ''[[Eopsaltria]]''.

The basic Il-96-300 is equipped with modern Russian avionics integrating six multi-function colour LCD displays, inertial and satellite navigation systems, and a [[Traffic Collision Avoidance System]] (including mode \"S\"). It allows the airplane to be operated with two [[crew member]]s. The avionics correspond to modern requirements on international routes in Europe and North America (RNP-1) and allow navigation and landing under ICAO CAT III/A conditions. The Il-96 is offered in three main variants: the Il-96-300, Il-96M/T and Il-96-400.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nThe Il-96-300 has a standard passenger capacity of 262 seats in a two-class configuration with 18 seats with a [[Airline seat|seat pitch]] of {{convert|54|in|cm}} and 244 seats with a pitch of {{convert|32|in|cm}}, of which typical seating is 3-3-3 (layout), but low density seating is possible with 2-4-2 (layout).

The Il-96M/T is broadly comparable with the [[Airbus A330|Airbus A330-300]] and [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]]CF, but is much cheaper. Development on the M/T variant stalled when the [[Export\u2013Import Bank of the United States|US Export\u2013Import Bank]] suspended talks on financing the engines and avionics, following pressure from [[Boeing]].

It features [[Supercritical airfoil|supercritical wings]] fitted with [[Wingtip device|winglets]], a [[glass cockpit]], and a [[fly-by-wire]] control system.

The basic Il-96-300 is equipped with modern Russian avionics integrating six multi-function colour LCD displays, inertial and satellite navigation systems, and a [[Traffic Collision Avoidance System]] (including mode \"S\"). It allows the airplane to be operated with two [[crew member]]s. The avionics correspond to modern requirements on international routes in Europe and North America (RNP-1) and allow navigation and landing under ICAO CAT III/A conditions. The Il-96 is offered in three main variants: the Il-96-300, Il-96M/T and Il-96-400.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nThe Il-96-300 has a standard passenger capacity of 262 seats in a two-class configuration with 18 seats with a [[Airline seat|seat pitch]] of {{convert|54|in|cm}} and 244 seats with a pitch of {{convert|32|in|cm}}, of which typical seating is 3-3-3 (layout), but low density seating is possible with 2-4-2 (layout).

It features a 10&nbsp;m (30&nbsp;ft) fuselage stretch, is 15 tonnes (33,000&nbsp;lb) heavier, is fitted with Western-style avionics, and is powered by four [[Pratt & Whitney PW2000|Pratt & Whitney PW2337]] engines with a thrust rating of 165&nbsp;kN (37,000&nbsp;lbf).

This turned it into a true\u2014but vastly more capable\u2014Il-86 successor. The Il-96M/T is broadly comparable with the [[Airbus A330|Airbus A330-300]] and [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]]CF, but is much cheaper. Development on the M/T variant stalled when the [[Export\u2013Import Bank of the United States|US Export\u2013Import Bank]] suspended talks on financing the engines and avionics, following pressure from [[Boeing]]. The dispute was later settled following an Aeroflot order for ten Boeing 737-400s\u2014placed in April 1997 in a deal worth US$440 million that were granted a tax exemption by the Russian government. Nevertheless, the financing was blocked again when four Boeing 767-300ERs also ordered by Aeroflot were not included in the accorded exemption. The deal was never realised.\n\n===Il-96T===\nThis is the freighter version of the Il-96-400.
