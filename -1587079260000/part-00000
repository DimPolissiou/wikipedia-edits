{"title_page": "Chinese honorifics", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=July 2015}}{{Technical|date=March 2019}}\n'''Chinese honorifics''' and honorific language ({{Ruby|\u656c\u8fad|j\u00ecngc\u00ed}}\uff0c{{Ruby|\u8b19\u8fad|qi\u0101nc\u00ed}}\uff0c{{Ruby|\u5a49\u8fad|w\u01cenc\u00ed}}\uff0c{{Ruby|\u5ba2\u5957\u8a9e|k\u00e8t\u00e0oy\u01d4}}\uff0c{{Ruby|\u96c5\u8a9e|y\u00e1y\u016d}}) are words, word constructs, and expressions in the Chinese language that convey self-deprecation, social respect, politeness, or deference. Once ubiquitously employed in ancient China, a large percent has fallen out of use in the contemporary Chinese lexicon. The promotion of [[Written vernacular Chinese|vernacular Chinese]] during the [[New Culture Movement]] (\u65b0\u6587\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8 or \u4e94\u56db\u6587\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8) of the 1910s and 1920s in China further hastened the demise of a large body of Chinese honorifics previously preserved in the vocabulary and grammar of [[Classical Chinese]].  \n\nAlthough Chinese honorifics have simplified to a large degree, contemporary Chinese still retains a sizable set of honorifics. Many of the classical constructs are also occasionally employed by contemporary speakers to convey formality, humility, politeness or respect. Usage of classical Chinese honorifics is also found frequently in contemporary Chinese literature and television or cinematic productions that are set in the historical periods. Honorific language in Chinese is achieved by using honorific or beautifying alternatives, prefixing or suffixing a word with a polite complement, or by dropping casual-sounding words. In general, language referring to oneself exhibits [[self-deprecating]] humbleness - called {{Ruby|\u8b19\u8a9e|qi\u0101ny\u016d}} ''(\"humble language\"''), while language referring to others shows approval and respect - called {{Ruby|\u656c\u8a9e|j\u00ecngy\u01d4}} (''\"respectful language\"''). Other types of honorific language include {{Ruby|\u5a49\u8a9e|w\u01ceny\u016d}} (''\"indirect language\"''), {{Ruby|\u5ba2\u5957\u8a9e|k\u00e8t\u00e0oy\u01d4}} (''\"courteous language\"''), and {{Ruby|\u96c5\u8a9e|y\u00e1y\u016d}} (''\"elegant language\"'') that are often used to convey a sense of respect, courtesy, or elegance. \n\nBecause of its official status as the common language of China, [[Mandarin Chinese]] is used herein synonymously with the term \"contemporary Chinese\". Variations in usage and grammar exist in the numerous modern [[Varieties of Chinese|Chinese dialects]].\n\n== Introduction ==\nThe term \u77e5\u66f8\u9054\u79ae (''Literally -- one who knows the books and achieves proper mannerism'') has been used to praise and characterize those of high academic and moral accomplishments and those of proper manner and conduct. Using the proper honorific or humble forms of address and other parts of speech toward oneself and toward others is an important element or requirement in the proper observation of \u79ae\u5100 (''l\u01d0y\u00ed'', ''etiquette, formality, and rite''). Honorific parts of speech include pronoun substitutes, modified nouns, proper nouns, and pronouns, modified verbs, honorific adjectives, honorific [[Chengyu|\u6210\u8a9e]] (''ch\u00e9ngy\u01d4, \"canned phrases/idioms\"''), and honorific alternatives for other neutral or deprecating words.   \n\nIn ancient China, myriad humble and respectful forms of address, in lieu of personal pronouns and names, were used for various social relationships and situations. The choice of a pronoun substitute was often in adherence to the concepts of {{Ruby|\u5c0a\u5351|z\u016bnb\u0113i}} (''Lit. above-beneath / superior-subordinate, \u201csocial hierarchy\u201d''), {{Ruby|\u8cb4\u8ce4|gu\u00ecji\u00e0n}} (''Lit. worthy-worthless'', \"''social class''\"), and {{Ruby|\u8f29\u5206|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} (''\"seniority\"'') or {{Ruby|\u8f29|b\u00e8i}} for short. \n\n=== Social Hierarchy and Class ===\nIn the ''[[Confucianism|Confucian]]'' philosophical classic of ''<u>{{Ruby|\u6613\u50b3\u00b7\u7e6b\u8fad\u4e0a|y\u00eczhu\u00e0n x\u00ecc\u00ed sh\u00e0ng}}</u>'' or [[Ten Wings|''<u>\"Yizhuan - Xici\"</u>'']] -- a latter day commentary on the book of ''<u>{{Ruby|\u6613\u7d93|y\u00ecj\u012bng}}</u>'' or \"[[I Ching|''<u>I Ching\"</u>'']] (''\"Book of Changes\"''), it is stated \"''\u5929\u5c0a\u5730\u5351\uff0c\u4e7e\u5764\u5b9a\u77e3\u3002\u5351\u9ad8\u4ee5\u9673\uff0c\u8cb4\u8ce4\u4f4d\u77e3\u3002''\" -- it was believed in ancient China that both the order of nature, i.e., \u5929\u5c0a\u5730\u5351 (''heaven be above, earth be beneath''), and from it the derived order of man, were long predetermined and dictated by the heavens, e.g., \u541b\u5c0a\u81e3\u5351 (''king be above/superior, court officials be beneath/subordinate''), \u7537\u5c0a\u5973\u5351 (''man superior, woman subordinate''), \u592b\u5c0a\u5a66\u5351 (''husband superior, wife subordinate''), and \u7236\u5c0a\u5b50\u5351 (''father superior, son subordinate'') etc. Every king and their subject, every man and woman, every husband and wife, and every father and son, should naturally follow this predetermined order and practice proper {{Ruby|\u793c\u4eea|l\u01d0y\u00ed}} and conduct. As a large part of {{Ruby|\u793c\u4eea|l\u01d0y\u00ed}}, proper speech was of great importance.  \n\nTherefore in speech, among other forms of {{Ruby|\u79ae\u5100|l\u01d0y\u00ed}} and social behaviors, the \"subordinate\"  or \"inferior\" would employ self-deprecating and humble language towards self and respectful language towards the \"superior\" as a recognition of their relative places in the \"natural\" hierarchy. On the other hand, the \"superiors\" would often also use humble language as a display of humility and virtue''.'' Unsurprisingly, the characters \u5c0a~ and \u5351~ also became honorific and humble prefixes, respectively. For example, the humble substitute {{Ruby|\u5351\u4e0b|b\u0113ixi\u00e0}}(''this inferior one below'') would be used, among other deprecating substitutes, in place of the pronoun \"I\", and the honorific substitute {{Ruby|\u5c0a\u4e0a|z\u016bnsh\u00e0ng}} (''the superior one above'') would replace the pronoun \"you\" (''later also used for \"your parents\"'').  \n\nRelated to {{Ruby|\u5c0a\u5351|z\u016bnb\u0113i}} is the concept of {{Ruby|\u8cb4\u8ce4|gu\u00ecji\u00e0n}}. Those with power, money and status were \u8cb4 (''worthy, honorable''), and those without were \u8ce4 (''worthless, despised''). These two characters also became the honorific and humble prefixes \u8cb4~ and \u8ce4~. Examples: \u8cb4\u570b (''your honorable country''), \u8cb4\u5e9a (''your honorable age''), \u8cb4\u59d3 (''your honorable surname''), \u8cb4\u516c\u53f8 (''your honorable company''), and \u8ce4\u59d3 (''my unworthy surname''), \u8ce4\u6c11 (''the unworthy and despised commoner''), \u8ce4\u59be (''this unworthy wife of yours''), \u8ce4\u5185 (''my unworthy wife''), etc. \u8cb4~ remains a commonly used honorific prefix to this day.\n\n=== Seniority ===\nLikewise, those of a junior {{Ruby|\u8f29\u4efd|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} (i.e., {{Ruby|\u665a\u8f29|w\u01cenb\u00e8i}} or {{Ruby|\u5f8c\u8f29|h\u00f2ub\u00e8i}}) would show respect and deference to their {{Ruby|\u524d\u8f29|qi\u00e1nbe\u00ec}} (''\"senior\"'') , {{Ruby|\u9577\u8f29|zh\u01cengbe\u00ec}} ''or'' {{Ruby|\u5148\u8f29|xi\u0101nbe\u00ec}} (''\"elder\"''), and {{Ruby|\u7956\u8f29|z\u016dbe\u00ec}} ''(\"ancestors\")''. {{Ruby|\u8f88\u5206|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} is not necessarily based on age, for example, a younger person who entered a school or profession before an older person would be considered the {{Ruby|\u524d\u8f29|qi\u00e1nbe\u00ec}}. A person who is much younger than his/her nephew in a large extended family would still be a {{Ruby|\u9577\u8f29|zh\u01cengbe\u00ec}} to the nephew''.'' If two people are of the same {{Ruby|\u8f29\u4efd|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} (i.e., {{Ruby|\u5e73\u8f29|p\u00edngbe\u00ec}} or {{Ruby|\u540c\u8f29|t\u00f3ngbe\u00ec}}''),'' then either experience or age would determine the hierarchy depending on the situation. \n\nContemporary Chinese mostly abandoned the {{Ruby|\u5c0a\u5351|z\u016bnb\u0113i}} and {{Ruby|\u8cb4\u8ce4|gu\u00ecji\u00e0n}} distinctions (especially \u5351 and \u8ce4) in its honorific practice, but retains elements of the {{Ruby|\u8f29\u4efd|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} distinctions. For example, the suffixes ~{{Ruby|\u59d0|ji\u0115}} (''Lit. elder sister'') and ~{{Ruby|\u54e5|g\u0113}} (''Lit. elder brother'') are commonly used by junior people when addressing their {{Ruby|\u5e73\u8f88|p\u00edngbe\u00ec}} seniors. Those of the next higher {{Ruby|\u8f29\u4efd|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} (i.e., {{Ruby|\u9577\u8f29|zh\u01cengbe\u00ec}}) acquire the suffixes ~\u59e8\uff0c~\u53d4 etc. Those even higher in {{Ruby|\u8f29\u4efd|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} receive the suffixes ~\u5a46\uff0c~\u516c\uff0c~\u4f2f etc. When addressing a {{Ruby|\u5e73\u8f29|p\u00edngbe\u00ec}} junior, the suffixes ~\u59b9, ~\u5f1f are used. While these suffixes derived from [[Chinese kinship|kinship names]], they are commonly used between unrelated people. Example: when addressing a group leader at work whose name is {{Ruby|\u82b3|f\u0101ng}}\uff0cthe less experienced person in the group might call her \u82b3\u59d0 ''F\u0101ng-ji\u011b''. Because these suffixes have an age connotation, their use and application are not always appropriate. Variations were created such as ~\u5c0f\u54e5\u54e5 (''Lit. little elder brother'')\uff0c ~\u5c0f\u59d0\u59d0 (''Lit. little elder sister'') to soften age connotations. A wrong {{Ruby|\u8f29\u4efd|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} suffix can also be used intentionally to please or belittle another person. For example, some older women may prefer a  \uff5e\u59e8 rather than \uff5e\u5a46 suffix, and a middle age woman may prefer to still be called ~\u59d0 rather than ~\u59e8. When these suffixes are used without a preceding name, or when a name is not complemented by one of these suffixes, the intimacy prefix {{Ruby|\u963f|\u0101}}~ is often added. {{Ruby|\u963f|\u0101}} is a functional particle without an actual meaning by itself, but when combined with a name (e.g., \u963f\u82b3\uff0c\u963f\u5f3a) or with one of the {{Ruby|\u8f29\u4efd|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} related suffixes (e.g., \u963f\u54e5\uff0c\u963f\u59e8\uff0c\u963f\u4f2f\uff0c\u963f\u5a46), {{Ruby|\u963f|\u0101}} adds a sense of intimacy (i.e., closeness, affection) with the addressed. {{Ruby|\u963f|\u0101}} can be used together with a {{Ruby|\u8f29\u4efd|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} suffix, e.g., \u963f\u82b3\u59d0 (''\u0101-F\u0101ng-ji\u011b'')\uff0c\u963f\u5f3a\u54e5 (''\u0101-Qi\u00e1ng-g\u0113''). Other related honorific modifiers include \u8001~\uff0c\u5927~\uff0c\u5c0f~\uff0c~\u603b\uff0c~\u8463, see noun complements section below for more details.  \n\n=== Honorific Verbs ===\nLike nouns and proper nouns, some Chinese verbs can also be complemented with an honorific modifier. For example, the verbs {{Ruby|\u544a|g\u00e0o}} ''(\"to tell\"''), {{Ruby|\u8fd8|hu\u00e1n}} ''(\"to return\"'')\uff0c{{Ruby|\u966a|p\u00e9i}} ''(\"to accompany\"''), {{Ruby|\u529d|qu\u00e0n}} ''(\"to urge\"'')\uff0c{{Ruby|\u9001|s\u00f2ng}} ''(\"to gift\"'') can be complemented by the honorific prefix {{Ruby|\u5949|f\u00e8ng}}~ (''Lit. to offer respectfully)'' to form the more polite versions \u5949\u544a (''I respectfully tell you''), \u5949\u8fd8 (''I respectfully return'' ''to you''), \u5949\u966a (''I respectfully accompany you''), \u5949\u529d (''I respectfully urge you''), and \u5949\u9001 (''I respectfully gift you''). Another example is the honorific prefix {{Ruby|\u606d|g\u014dng}}~ (''Lit. \"look forward to respectfully''\"), e.g., \u606d\u8d3a (''I respectfully congratulate you''), \u606d\u5019 (''I respectfully await you''), \u606d\u8bf7 (''I respectfully invite you'')\uff0c\u606d\u8fce (''I respectfully welcome you''). The addition of the honorific prefix turns these verbs into a politer version. Unlike adverbs, the prefixes are often verbs themselves, and the compounded honorific verb functions as a single language unit (i.e., a single verb). Other common prefixes for verbs and verb examples are summarized in the verb complements section below.\n\n=== Grammar ===\nIn practice, many of the honorific compound words are used as canned polite word alternatives, rather than being grammatically composed as people speak. There is not a systemic rule in Chinese grammar to alter words (e.g., conjugation or other inflections) for the purpose of increasing speech politeness, though the same effect can often be achieved. However, in letters ({{Ruby|\u4e66\u4fe1|sh\u016bx\u00ecn}}\uff0c{{Ruby|\u5bb6\u4e66|ji\u0101sh\u016b}}) and official documents ({{Ruby|\u516c\u6587|g\u014dngw\u00e9n}}), a complex system of honorifics and rule sets exists.\n\n== Examples of Honorific Speech ==\n'''Example 1:'''<!-- RUBYTEXT FAIL in original\n-->\n\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u4f60|n\u01d0}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u59d3|x\u00ecng}}  {{ruby-zh-p|\u751a\u9ebc|sh\u00e9nme}} \uff1f\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u4f60|n\u01d0}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u59d3|x\u00ecng}}  {{ruby-zh-p|\u4ec0\u4e48|sh\u00e9nme}} \uff1f\n:''\"What is your family name (surname)?\"''\n\nThe sentence above is a perfectly acceptable question when addressing others of equal or lower status (e.g., addressing a junior or a child). To increase politeness, e.g., if the addressee is of higher status or the person asking the question wants to show more respect, several changes may be employed:\n\n#The honorific prefix {{lang|zh|\u8acb}} (''<small>lit.</small> to request'') + verb {{lang|zh|\u554f}} (''to ask'') (''q\u01d0ngw\u00e8n,'' ''\"May I please ask...\"; <small>lit.</small> [I] request to ask'') may be added\n#The regular second-person pronoun {{lang|zh|\u4f60}} (''n\u01d0'', ''\"you\"'') may be replaced by the honorific second-person pronoun {{lang|zh|\u60a8}} (''n\u00edn'', ''\"you\" [courteous]'')\n#The honorific prefix {{lang|zh|\u8cb4}} (''gu\u00ec, <small>lit.</small> \"worthy\", \"honorable\"'') may be added before {{lang|zh|\u59d3}} (''x\u00ecng'', ''\"family name\"''); \u59d3 is used as a verb (''i.e., \"to have the family name of\"'').\n#If the honorific prefix {{lang|zh|\u8cb4}} is added, the contemporary interrogative pronoun {{lang|zh|\u751a\u9ebd}} (''sh\u00e9nme'', ''\"what\"'') is usually dropped.\n\nThe resulting sentence: \n<!-- RUBYTEXT FAIL in original\n-->\n\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u8acb|q\u01d0ng}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u554f|w\u00e8n}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u60a8|n\u00edn}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u8cb4\u59d3|gu\u00ecx\u00ecng}}  \uff1f\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u8bf7|q\u01d0ng}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u95ee|w\u00e8n}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u60a8|n\u00edn}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u8d35\u59d3|gu\u00ecx\u00ecng}}  \uff1f\n:''\"May I (respectfully) request to ask you (whom I cherish) for your honorable surname?\"''\n\nis more polite and commonly used among people in formal situations.\n\n'''Example 2:'''\n\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u5c0f\u59d0|xi\u00e1oji\u011b}}\uff0c{{ruby-zh-p|\u4f60|n\u01d0}}{{ruby-zh-p|\u591a\u5927|du\u014dd\u00e0}}{{ruby-zh-p|\u4e86|le}}\uff1f\n:''\"Miss, how old are you?\"''\n\nThe above can be changed to a more polite question by employing the honorific prefix \u6562 (''<small>lit.</small> to dare'') + verb \u554f (''to ask'') (''g\u01cenw\u00e8n'', ''\"[May I] dare to ask...\"''), and honorific prefix \u82b3 (''f\u0101ng, <small>lit.</small> fragrant, virtuous, beautiful'') + noun \u9f61 (''l\u00edng, age'').\n\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u6562\u554f|g\u01cenw\u00e8n}}{{ruby-zh-p|\u5c0f\u59d0|xi\u00e1oji\u011b}}{{ruby-zh-p|\u82b3\u9f61|f\u0101ngl\u00edng}}?\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u6562\u95ee|g\u01cenw\u00e8n}}{{ruby-zh-p|\u5c0f\u59d0|xi\u00e1oji\u011b}}{{ruby-zh-p|\u82b3\u9f84|f\u0101ngl\u00edng}}? \n:''\"May I dare to ask for this Miss's age (of fragrance and beauty)?\"''\n\nThe second-person pronoun {{lang|zh|\u4f60}} (''\"you\"'') is substituted entirely by the honorific title {{lang|zh|\u5c0f\u59d0}} (''\"Miss\"'') in this case. This latter way of questioning is more of classical usage, but is still occasionally used in contemporary Chinese. It is also an example of elegant speech ({{Ruby|\u96c5\u8a9e|y\u00e1y\u016d}}).\n\n\n== Categorization ==\nIn general, there are several types of honorifics used in the Chinese language as described below.  \n\n=== Respectful Language ===\n{{Ruby|\u656c\u8a9e|j\u00ecngy\u01d4}} - Respectful Language employs modified words or substitutes called {{Ruby|\u656c\u8fad|j\u00ecngc\u00ed}} (''Lit. respectful vocabulary'') that convey a sense of respect for the addressee. For example: \n\n*{{Ruby|\u4ee4\u611b|l\u00ecng'\u00e0i}}: ''Lit. the beautiful and beloved --'' Your daughter; the honorific prefix \u4ee4~ replaces the pronoun \"your\".\n*{{Ruby|\u4ee4\u5343\u91d1|l\u00ecngqi\u0101nj\u012bn}}'': Lit. the beautiful one who is worth a thousand gold --'' Your daughter.\n*{{Ruby|\u8cb4\u5bf6\u865f|gu\u00ecb\u01ceoh\u00e0o}}: ''Lit. the highly valued precious banner'' -- Your business; the honorific prefix \u8cb4~ replaces the pronoun \"your\", and the prefix \u5bf3~ modifies \u865f to form an honorific substitute for someone's business.\n\n=== Humble Language ===\n{{Ruby|\u8b19\u8a9e|qi\u0101ny\u016d}} - Humble Language employs modified words or substitutes called {{Ruby|\u8b19\u8fad|qi\u0101nc\u00ed}} (''Lit. humble vocabulary)'' that convey a sense of self-deprecation and humility for the speaker. For example: \n\n*{{Ruby|\u5728\u4e0b|z\u00e0ixi\u00e0}}'': Lit. this one who is beneath you --'' used as pronoun \"I\"\n*{{Ruby|\u5bd2\u820d|h\u00e1nsh\u00e8}}'': Lit. Humble and Insignificant Residence --'' my home\n*{{Ruby|\u8ce4\u5185|ji\u00e0nn\u00e8i}}: ''Lit. the worthless despised one inside'' -- my wife\n\n=== Indirect Language ===\n{{Ruby|\u5a49\u8a9e|w\u01ceny\u016d}} - Indirect Language employs words called {{Ruby|\u5a49\u8fad|w\u01cenc\u00ed}} (''Lit. indirect vocabulary - e.g., euphemisms'') that are used to hide or beautify an otherwise unfortunate event or action.  For example: \n\n*{{Ruby|\u6b78\u5929|gu\u012bti\u0101n}}'': Lit. return to heaven --'' to have died\n*{{Ruby|\u6302\u5f69|gu\u00e0ca\u01d0}}: ''Lit''. ''to hang colorful decorations'' -- to have been shot\n*{{Ruby|\u51a4\u5bb6|yu\u0101njia}}: ''Lit. destined/mortal enemies'' -- often used to mean lovers\n\n=== Courteous Language ===\n{{Ruby|\u5ba2\u5957\u8a9e|k\u00e8t\u00e0oy\u01d4}} - Courteous Language employs specific words or phrases that have courteous and praising connotations intended to flatter the addressee. For example: \n\n*{{Ruby|\u4e0d\u6562\u9ad8\u6500|b\u00f9g\u01cen g\u0101op\u0101n}}'': Lit. dare not climb up high to you'' -''-'' I dare not compare myself to you\n*{{Ruby|\u4e45\u4ef0\u5927\u540d|ji\u00fay\u01ceng d\u00e0m\u00edng}}'': Lit. long admired big name --'' I've known and admired you for a long time; used when meeting someone you've heard of (not necessarily admired).\n*{{Ruby|\u9ad8\u64e1\u8cb4\u624b|g\u0101ot\u00e1i gu\u00ecsh\u01d2u}}'': Lit. lift up high honorable hand --'' Please be magnanimous and don't hurt me (i.e., stop doing what you intend to do to me)\n\n=== Elegant Language ===\n{{Ruby|\u96c5\u8a9e|y\u00e1y\u016d}} - Elegant Language employs elegant or beautiful expressions and words in lieu of everyday casual words and phrases to describe people, objects, actions or concepts. It is often used on occasions where casual language may be inappropriate. Due to the lack of equivalent expressions in English, the translated phrases often do not convey the same sense of beauty or elegance. Examples:\n\n*{{Ruby|\u7d05\u9854\u77e5\u5df1|h\u00f3ngy\u00e1n zh\u012bj\u01d0}}: ''Lit. red face / know self'' -- beautiful beloved girlfriend (\"red\" refers to the make up or the natural color on a beautiful young woman's face; \"know self\" means someone who knows one well as in the close friendship between lovers).

Below is a collection of the better known honorific forms of address that have been used at one time or another in the Chinese lexicon. Although many are obsolete in usage, most remain relevant in contemporary literature and in the understanding of the Chinese language. Pronunciations given are those of today's [[Mandarin Chinese]]. Because of the vast number and complexity, the list provided is intended for reference rather than completeness.  \n\n===First-Person===\nWhen referring to oneself in ancient China, people avoided first-person pronouns (\"I\", \"me\", \"we\", and \"us\"). Instead, a third-person descriptor was used, which varied according to the situation. Referring to oneself in the third-person could be used arrogantly as well, to assert one's superiority or dominance over one's audience. This was most common in the imperial middle management {{ndash}} the imperial consorts, the military, and the imperial bureaucracy (e.g., \u672c\u5b98\uff0c\u672c\u5c06\u519b\uff0c\u672c\u5bab\uff0c\u672c\u5927\u723a), with the emperor instead often describing himself in sorrowful terms out of respect for his deceased father (e.g., \u5b64\u738b \"''This Orphaned King''\"\uff0c\u5be1\u4eba \"''This Lonesome Man''\").\n\nFor the same reasons, and to a much lesser degree, the first-person pronouns are sometimes avoided also in contemporary usage. Often, the generic self-referencing prefix \u672c~\uff0c\u8be5~\uff0c or a humble / self-deprecating prefix such as \u655d~ is used with a third-person descriptor, for example: \u672c\u4eba\u662f\u6765\u81ea\u7532\u516c\u53f8\u7684\uff0c\u655d\u516c\u53f8\u60f3\u8ddf\u60a8\u505a\u4e2a\u8bbf\u95ee\u3002-- Literally, \"''This person is from company A, this unkempt company would like to do an interview with you.''\" translated to \"''I am from company A, we would like to do an interview with you.''\"\n\nProvided below are some first-person honorific substitutes and usages. Their relevancy (i.e., contemporary vs. classical) and gender association are also indicated. Plurals (\"we\", \"us\") in classical Chinese are formed by the suffixes ~\u7b49 or ~\u4f17\u4eba etc., and in contemporary Chinese by ~\u4eec. A \"classical usage\" designation does not preclude usage in contemporary speech or writing, as contemporary Chinese often incorporates classical elements, though it is much less likely to be seen or used in the contemporary context. \n\n==== Commoners and the Humble ====\nThe following directly replace the pronoun \"I\" in usage by commoners or people of low social status. Example: rather than \u543e(\u6211)\u4ee5\u70ba\u6b64\u65b9\u4e0d\u53ef - \"''I think this idea will not work''\" one would say \u611a\u4ee5\u70ba\u6b64\u65b9\u4e0d\u53ef - \"''This unintelligent one thinks this idea will not work.''\"\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Often, the same honorific substitutes can be used for both second-person and third-person.\n\nIn contemporary Chinese (both spoken and written), the second-person singular pronoun {{lang|zh|\u4f60}} (''n\u01d0'', \"you\") can be substituted with its polite form {{lang|zh|\u60a8}} (''n\u01d0n'', \"you\" [cherished]) to express politeness. In some cases, the addressee's profession or title can be used. In others, specific honorific substitutes are used, e.g., \u9601\u4e0b (Lit. beneath your pavilion) is used instead of the pronoun \"you\" to show respect. Historically, many other honorific usages existed.\n\nIn contemporary usage, the pronouns \u4f60/\u60a8\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\uff0c\u4ed6/\u5979\uff0cand \u4ed6/\u5979\u4eec are sometimes appended redundantly to the honorific substitute. For example, \u8bf7\u9601\u4e0b\u60a8\u6162\u8d70 - \u60a8 is optionally inserted after \u9601\u4e0b. This is likely out of a contemporary habit to use actual pronouns in speech.  \n\nProvided below are some of the better known second-person or third-person honorific substitutes and usages. \n\n==== Royalty ====\nThe following were honorifics used when people addressed the Royalty in ancient China. Often, imperial titles were also used as pronoun substitutes. For example, the emperor may address the empress by her title \u7687\u540e. A royal servant may address a princess as \u516c\u4e3b. Not all royal titles are listed. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Traditional Chinese !! Simplified Chinese !! Pinyin\n!Literal Meaning!! Meaning in Usage\n!Gender\n!Contemporary or Classical Usage!!

Some may have shown up in pronoun discussions. While noun modifiers are technically adjectives, honorific prefixes/suffixes are different from normal adjectives in that they become part of the noun in usage, and the meaning of the modifying prefix/suffix is usually not taken literally - only added functionally to show respect or humility. Because Chinese words are usually formed also by combining multiple root characters (each with a literal meaning), it is not always immediately apparent when using a polite version of a word that an honorific modifier is in use.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Once ubiquitously employed in ancient China, a large percent has fallen out of use in the contemporary Chinese lexicon. The promotion of [[Written vernacular Chinese|vernacular Chinese]] during the [[New Culture Movement]] (\u65b0\u6587\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8 or \u4e94\u56db\u6587\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8) of the 1910s and 1920s in China further hastened the demise of a large body of Chinese honorifics previously preserved in the vocabulary and grammar of [[Classical Chinese]].  \n\nAlthough Chinese honorifics have simplified to a large degree, contemporary Chinese still retains a sizable set of honorifics. Many of the classical constructs are also occasionally employed by contemporary speakers to convey formality, humility, politeness or respect. Usage of classical Chinese honorifics is also found frequently in contemporary Chinese literature and television or cinematic productions that are set in the historical periods. Honorific language in Chinese is achieved by using honorific or beautifying alternatives, prefixing or suffixing a word with a polite complement, or by dropping casual-sounding words. In general, language referring to oneself exhibits [[self-deprecating]] humbleness - called {{Ruby|\u8b19\u8a9e|qi\u0101ny\u016d}} ''(\"humble language\"''), while language referring to others shows approval and respect - called {{Ruby|\u656c\u8a9e|j\u00ecngy\u01d4}} (''\"respectful language\"''). Other types of honorific language include {{Ruby|\u5a49\u8a9e|w\u01ceny\u016d}} (''\"indirect language\"''), {{Ruby|\u5ba2\u5957\u8a9e|k\u00e8t\u00e0oy\u01d4}} (''\"courteous language\"''), and {{Ruby|\u96c5\u8a9e|y\u00e1y\u016d}} (''\"elegant language\"'') that are often used to convey a sense of respect, courtesy, or elegance. \n\nBecause of its official status as the common language of China, [[Mandarin Chinese]] is used herein synonymously with the term \"contemporary Chinese\". Variations in usage and grammar exist in the numerous modern [[Varieties of Chinese|Chinese dialects]].\n\n== Introduction ==\nThe term \u77e5\u66f8\u9054\u79ae (''Literally -- one who knows the books and achieves proper mannerism'') has been used to praise and characterize those of high academic and moral accomplishments and those of proper manner and conduct. Using the proper honorific or humble forms of address and other parts of speech toward oneself and toward others is an important element or requirement in the proper observation of \u79ae\u5100 (''l\u01d0y\u00ed'', ''etiquette, formality, and rite''). Honorific parts of speech include pronoun substitutes, modified nouns, proper nouns, and pronouns, modified verbs, honorific adjectives, honorific [[Chengyu|\u6210\u8a9e]] (''ch\u00e9ngy\u01d4, \"canned phrases/idioms\"''), and honorific alternatives for other neutral or deprecating words.   \n\nIn ancient China, myriad humble and respectful forms of address, in lieu of personal pronouns and names, were used for various social relationships and situations. The choice of a pronoun substitute was often in adherence to the concepts of {{Ruby|\u5c0a\u5351|z\u016bnb\u0113i}} (''Lit. above-beneath / superior-subordinate, \u201csocial hierarchy\u201d''), {{Ruby|\u8cb4\u8ce4|gu\u00ecji\u00e0n}} (''Lit. worthy-worthless'', \"''social class''\"), and {{Ruby|\u8f29\u5206|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} (''\"seniority\"'') or {{Ruby|\u8f29|b\u00e8i}} for short. \n\n=== Social Hierarchy and Class ===\nIn the ''[[Confucianism|Confucian]]'' philosophical classic of ''<u>{{Ruby|\u6613\u50b3\u00b7\u7e6b\u8fad\u4e0a|y\u00eczhu\u00e0n x\u00ecc\u00ed sh\u00e0ng}}</u>'' or [[Ten Wings|''<u>\"Yizhuan - Xici\"</u>'']] -- a latter day commentary on the book of ''<u>{{Ruby|\u6613\u7d93|y\u00ecj\u012bng}}</u>'' or \"[[I Ching|''<u>I Ching\"</u>'']] (''\"Book of Changes\"''), it is stated \"''\u5929\u5c0a\u5730\u5351\uff0c\u4e7e\u5764\u5b9a\u77e3\u3002\u5351\u9ad8\u4ee5\u9673\uff0c\u8cb4\u8ce4\u4f4d\u77e3\u3002''\" -- it was believed in ancient China that both the order of nature, i.e., \u5929\u5c0a\u5730\u5351 (''heaven be above, earth be beneath''), and from it the derived order of man, were long predetermined and dictated by the heavens, e.g., \u541b\u5c0a\u81e3\u5351 (''king be above/superior, court officials be beneath/subordinate''), \u7537\u5c0a\u5973\u5351 (''man superior, woman subordinate''), \u592b\u5c0a\u5a66\u5351 (''husband superior, wife subordinate''), and \u7236\u5c0a\u5b50\u5351 (''father superior, son subordinate'') etc. Every king and their subject, every man and woman, every husband and wife, and every father and son, should naturally follow this predetermined order and practice proper {{Ruby|\u793c\u4eea|l\u01d0y\u00ed}} and conduct. As a large part of {{Ruby|\u793c\u4eea|l\u01d0y\u00ed}}, proper speech was of great importance.  \n\nTherefore in speech, among other forms of {{Ruby|\u79ae\u5100|l\u01d0y\u00ed}} and social behaviors, the \"subordinate\"  or \"inferior\" would employ self-deprecating and humble language towards self and respectful language towards the \"superior\" as a recognition of their relative places in the \"natural\" hierarchy. On the other hand, the \"superiors\" would often also use humble language as a display of humility and virtue''.'' Unsurprisingly, the characters \u5c0a~ and \u5351~ also became honorific and humble prefixes, respectively. For example, the humble substitute {{Ruby|\u5351\u4e0b|b\u0113ixi\u00e0}}(''this inferior one below'') would be used, among other deprecating substitutes, in place of the pronoun \"I\", and the honorific substitute {{Ruby|\u5c0a\u4e0a|z\u016bnsh\u00e0ng}} (''the superior one above'') would replace the pronoun \"you\" (''later also used for \"your parents\"'').  \n\nRelated to {{Ruby|\u5c0a\u5351|z\u016bnb\u0113i}} is the concept of {{Ruby|\u8cb4\u8ce4|gu\u00ecji\u00e0n}}. Those with power, money and status were \u8cb4 (''worthy, honorable''), and those without were \u8ce4 (''worthless, despised''). These two characters also became the honorific and humble prefixes \u8cb4~ and \u8ce4~. Examples: \u8cb4\u570b (''your honorable country''), \u8cb4\u5e9a (''your honorable age''), \u8cb4\u59d3 (''your honorable surname''), \u8cb4\u516c\u53f8 (''your honorable company''), and \u8ce4\u59d3 (''my unworthy surname''), \u8ce4\u6c11 (''the unworthy and despised commoner''), \u8ce4\u59be (''this unworthy wife of yours''), \u8ce4\u5185 (''my unworthy wife''), etc. \u8cb4~ remains a commonly used honorific prefix to this day.\n\n=== Seniority ===\nLikewise, those of a junior {{Ruby|\u8f29\u4efd|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} (i.e., {{Ruby|\u665a\u8f29|w\u01cenb\u00e8i}} or {{Ruby|\u5f8c\u8f29|h\u00f2ub\u00e8i}}) would show respect and deference to their {{Ruby|\u524d\u8f29|qi\u00e1nbe\u00ec}} (''\"senior\"'') , {{Ruby|\u9577\u8f29|zh\u01cengbe\u00ec}} ''or'' {{Ruby|\u5148\u8f29|xi\u0101nbe\u00ec}} (''\"elder\"''), and {{Ruby|\u7956\u8f29|z\u016dbe\u00ec}} ''(\"ancestors\")''. {{Ruby|\u8f88\u5206|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} is not necessarily based on age, for example, a younger person who entered a school or profession before an older person would be considered the {{Ruby|\u524d\u8f29|qi\u00e1nbe\u00ec}}. A person who is much younger than his/her nephew in a large extended family would still be a {{Ruby|\u9577\u8f29|zh\u01cengbe\u00ec}} to the nephew''.'' If two people are of the same {{Ruby|\u8f29\u4efd|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} (i.e., {{Ruby|\u5e73\u8f29|p\u00edngbe\u00ec}} or {{Ruby|\u540c\u8f29|t\u00f3ngbe\u00ec}}''),'' then either experience or age would determine the hierarchy depending on the situation. \n\nContemporary Chinese mostly abandoned the {{Ruby|\u5c0a\u5351|z\u016bnb\u0113i}} and {{Ruby|\u8cb4\u8ce4|gu\u00ecji\u00e0n}} distinctions (especially \u5351 and \u8ce4) in its honorific practice, but retains elements of the {{Ruby|\u8f29\u4efd|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} distinctions. For example, the suffixes ~{{Ruby|\u59d0|ji\u0115}} (''Lit. elder sister'') and ~{{Ruby|\u54e5|g\u0113}} (''Lit. elder brother'') are commonly used by junior people when addressing their {{Ruby|\u5e73\u8f88|p\u00edngbe\u00ec}} seniors. Those of the next higher {{Ruby|\u8f29\u4efd|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} (i.e., {{Ruby|\u9577\u8f29|zh\u01cengbe\u00ec}}) acquire the suffixes ~\u59e8\uff0c~\u53d4 etc. Those even higher in {{Ruby|\u8f29\u4efd|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} receive the suffixes ~\u5a46\uff0c~\u516c\uff0c~\u4f2f etc. When addressing a {{Ruby|\u5e73\u8f29|p\u00edngbe\u00ec}} junior, the suffixes ~\u59b9, ~\u5f1f are used. While these suffixes derived from [[Chinese kinship|kinship names]], they are commonly used between unrelated people. Example: when addressing a group leader at work whose name is {{Ruby|\u82b3|f\u0101ng}}\uff0cthe less experienced person in the group might call her \u82b3\u59d0 ''F\u0101ng-ji\u011b''. Because these suffixes have an age connotation, their use and application are not always appropriate. Variations were created such as ~\u5c0f\u54e5\u54e5 (''Lit. little elder brother'')\uff0c ~\u5c0f\u59d0\u59d0 (''Lit. little elder sister'') to soften age connotations. A wrong {{Ruby|\u8f29\u4efd|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} suffix can also be used intentionally to please or belittle another person. For example, some older women may prefer a  \uff5e\u59e8 rather than \uff5e\u5a46 suffix, and a middle age woman may prefer to still be called ~\u59d0 rather than ~\u59e8. When these suffixes are used without a preceding name, or when a name is not complemented by one of these suffixes, the intimacy prefix {{Ruby|\u963f|\u0101}}~ is often added. {{Ruby|\u963f|\u0101}} is a functional particle without an actual meaning by itself, but when combined with a name (e.g., \u963f\u82b3\uff0c\u963f\u5f3a) or with one of the {{Ruby|\u8f29\u4efd|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} related suffixes (e.g., \u963f\u54e5\uff0c\u963f\u59e8\uff0c\u963f\u4f2f\uff0c\u963f\u5a46), {{Ruby|\u963f|\u0101}} adds a sense of intimacy (i.e., closeness, affection) with the addressed. {{Ruby|\u963f|\u0101}} can be used together with a {{Ruby|\u8f29\u4efd|b\u00e8if\u00e8n}} suffix, e.g., \u963f\u82b3\u59d0 (''\u0101-F\u0101ng-ji\u011b'')\uff0c\u963f\u5f3a\u54e5 (''\u0101-Qi\u00e1ng-g\u0113''). Other related honorific modifiers include \u8001~\uff0c\u5927~\uff0c\u5c0f~\uff0c~\u603b\uff0c~\u8463, see noun complements section below for more details.  \n\n=== Honorific Verbs ===\nLike nouns and proper nouns, some Chinese verbs can also be complemented with an honorific modifier. For example, the verbs {{Ruby|\u544a|g\u00e0o}} ''(\"to tell\"''), {{Ruby|\u8fd8|hu\u00e1n}} ''(\"to return\"'')\uff0c{{Ruby|\u966a|p\u00e9i}} ''(\"to accompany\"''), {{Ruby|\u529d|qu\u00e0n}} ''(\"to urge\"'')\uff0c{{Ruby|\u9001|s\u00f2ng}} ''(\"to gift\"'') can be complemented by the honorific prefix {{Ruby|\u5949|f\u00e8ng}}~ (''Lit. to offer respectfully)'' to form the more polite versions \u5949\u544a (''I respectfully tell you''), \u5949\u8fd8 (''I respectfully return'' ''to you''), \u5949\u966a (''I respectfully accompany you''), \u5949\u529d (''I respectfully urge you''), and \u5949\u9001 (''I respectfully gift you''). Another example is the honorific prefix {{Ruby|\u606d|g\u014dng}}~ (''Lit. \"look forward to respectfully''\"), e.g., \u606d\u8d3a (''I respectfully congratulate you''), \u606d\u5019 (''I respectfully await you''), \u606d\u8bf7 (''I respectfully invite you'')\uff0c\u606d\u8fce (''I respectfully welcome you''). The addition of the honorific prefix turns these verbs into a politer version. Unlike adverbs, the prefixes are often verbs themselves, and the compounded honorific verb functions as a single language unit (i.e., a single verb). Other common prefixes for verbs and verb examples are summarized in the verb complements section below.\n\n=== Grammar ===\nIn practice, many of the honorific compound words are used as canned polite word alternatives, rather than being grammatically composed as people speak. There is not a systemic rule in Chinese grammar to alter words (e.g., conjugation or other inflections) for the purpose of increasing speech politeness, though the same effect can often be achieved. However, in letters ({{Ruby|\u4e66\u4fe1|sh\u016bx\u00ecn}}\uff0c{{Ruby|\u5bb6\u4e66|ji\u0101sh\u016b}}) and official documents ({{Ruby|\u516c\u6587|g\u014dngw\u00e9n}}), a complex system of honorifics and rule sets exists.\n\n== Examples of Honorific Speech ==\n'''Example 1:'''<!-- RUBYTEXT FAIL in original\n-->\n\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u4f60|n\u01d0}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u59d3|x\u00ecng}}  {{ruby-zh-p|\u751a\u9ebc|sh\u00e9nme}} \uff1f\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u4f60|n\u01d0}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u59d3|x\u00ecng}}  {{ruby-zh-p|\u4ec0\u4e48|sh\u00e9nme}} \uff1f\n:''\"What is your family name (surname)?\"''\n\nThe sentence above is a perfectly acceptable question when addressing others of equal or lower status (e.g., addressing a junior or a child). To increase politeness, e.g., if the addressee is of higher status or the person asking the question wants to show more respect, several changes may be employed:\n\n#The honorific prefix {{lang|zh|\u8acb}} (''<small>lit.</small> to request'') + verb {{lang|zh|\u554f}} (''to ask'') (''q\u01d0ngw\u00e8n,'' ''\"May I please ask...\"; <small>lit.</small> [I] request to ask'') may be added\n#The regular second-person pronoun {{lang|zh|\u4f60}} (''n\u01d0'', ''\"you\"'') may be replaced by the honorific second-person pronoun {{lang|zh|\u60a8}} (''n\u00edn'', ''\"you\" [courteous]'')\n#The honorific prefix {{lang|zh|\u8cb4}} (''gu\u00ec, <small>lit.</small> \"worthy\", \"honorable\"'') may be added before {{lang|zh|\u59d3}} (''x\u00ecng'', ''\"family name\"''); \u59d3 is used as a verb (''i.e., \"to have the family name of\"'').\n#If the honorific prefix {{lang|zh|\u8cb4}} is added, the contemporary interrogative pronoun {{lang|zh|\u751a\u9ebd}} (''sh\u00e9nme'', ''\"what\"'') is usually dropped.\n\nThe resulting sentence: \n<!-- RUBYTEXT FAIL in original\n-->\n\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u8acb|q\u01d0ng}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u554f|w\u00e8n}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u60a8|n\u00edn}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u8cb4\u59d3|gu\u00ecx\u00ecng}}  \uff1f\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u8bf7|q\u01d0ng}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u95ee|w\u00e8n}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u60a8|n\u00edn}} {{ruby-zh-p|\u8d35\u59d3|gu\u00ecx\u00ecng}}  \uff1f\n:''\"May I (respectfully) request to ask you (whom I cherish) for your honorable surname?\"''\n\nis more polite and commonly used among people in formal situations.\n\n'''Example 2:'''\n\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u5c0f\u59d0|xi\u00e1oji\u011b}}\uff0c{{ruby-zh-p|\u4f60|n\u01d0}}{{ruby-zh-p|\u591a\u5927|du\u014dd\u00e0}}{{ruby-zh-p|\u4e86|le}}\uff1f\n:''\"Miss, how old are you?\"''\n\nThe above can be changed to a more polite question by employing the honorific prefix \u6562 (''<small>lit.</small> to dare'') + verb \u554f (''to ask'') (''g\u01cenw\u00e8n'', ''\"[May I] dare to ask...\"''), and honorific prefix \u82b3 (''f\u0101ng, <small>lit.</small> fragrant, virtuous, beautiful'') + noun \u9f61 (''l\u00edng, age'').\n\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u6562\u554f|g\u01cenw\u00e8n}}{{ruby-zh-p|\u5c0f\u59d0|xi\u00e1oji\u011b}}{{ruby-zh-p|\u82b3\u9f61|f\u0101ngl\u00edng}}?\n:{{ruby-zh-p|\u6562\u95ee|g\u01cenw\u00e8n}}{{ruby-zh-p|\u5c0f\u59d0|xi\u00e1oji\u011b}}{{ruby-zh-p|\u82b3\u9f84|f\u0101ngl\u00edng}}? \n:''\"May I dare to ask for this Miss's age (of fragrance and beauty)?\"''\n\nThe second-person pronoun {{lang|zh|\u4f60}} (''\"you\"'') is substituted entirely by the honorific title {{lang|zh|\u5c0f\u59d0}} (''\"Miss\"'') in this case. This latter way of questioning is more of classical usage, but is still occasionally used in contemporary Chinese. It is also an example of elegant speech ({{Ruby|\u96c5\u8a9e|y\u00e1y\u016d}}).\n\n\n== Categorization ==\nIn general, there are several types of honorifics used in the Chinese language as described below.  \n\n=== Respectful Language ===\n{{Ruby|\u656c\u8a9e|j\u00ecngy\u01d4}} - Respectful Language employs modified words or substitutes called {{Ruby|\u656c\u8fad|j\u00ecngc\u00ed}} (''Lit. respectful vocabulary'') that convey a sense of respect for the addressee. For example: \n\n*{{Ruby|\u4ee4\u611b|l\u00ecng'\u00e0i}}: ''Lit. the beautiful and beloved --'' Your daughter; the honorific prefix \u4ee4~ replaces the pronoun \"your\".\n*{{Ruby|\u4ee4\u5343\u91d1|l\u00ecngqi\u0101nj\u012bn}}'': Lit. the beautiful one who is worth a thousand gold --'' Your daughter.\n*{{Ruby|\u8cb4\u5bf6\u865f|gu\u00ecb\u01ceoh\u00e0o}}: ''Lit. the highly valued precious banner'' -- Your business; the honorific prefix \u8cb4~ replaces the pronoun \"your\", and the prefix \u5bf3~ modifies \u865f to form an honorific substitute for someone's business.\n\n=== Humble Language ===\n{{Ruby|\u8b19\u8a9e|qi\u0101ny\u016d}} - Humble Language employs modified words or substitutes called {{Ruby|\u8b19\u8fad|qi\u0101nc\u00ed}} (''Lit. humble vocabulary)'' that convey a sense of self-deprecation and humility for the speaker. For example: \n\n*{{Ruby|\u5728\u4e0b|z\u00e0ixi\u00e0}}'': Lit. this one who is beneath you --'' used as pronoun \"I\"\n*{{Ruby|\u5bd2\u820d|h\u00e1nsh\u00e8}}'': Lit. Humble and Insignificant Residence --'' my home\n*{{Ruby|\u8ce4\u5185|ji\u00e0nn\u00e8i}}: ''Lit. the worthless despised one inside'' -- my wife\n\n=== Indirect Language ===\n{{Ruby|\u5a49\u8a9e|w\u01ceny\u016d}} - Indirect Language employs words called {{Ruby|\u5a49\u8fad|w\u01cenc\u00ed}} (''Lit. indirect vocabulary - e.g., euphemisms'') that are used to hide or beautify an otherwise unfortunate event or action.  For example: \n\n*{{Ruby|\u6b78\u5929|gu\u012bti\u0101n}}'': Lit. return to heaven --'' to have died\n*{{Ruby|\u6302\u5f69|gu\u00e0ca\u01d0}}: ''Lit''. ''to hang colorful decorations'' -- to have been shot\n*{{Ruby|\u51a4\u5bb6|yu\u0101njia}}: ''Lit. destined/mortal enemies'' -- often used to mean lovers\n\n=== Courteous Language ===\n{{Ruby|\u5ba2\u5957\u8a9e|k\u00e8t\u00e0oy\u01d4}} - Courteous Language employs specific words or phrases that have courteous and praising connotations intended to flatter the addressee. For example: \n\n*{{Ruby|\u4e0d\u6562\u9ad8\u6500|b\u00f9g\u01cen g\u0101op\u0101n}}'': Lit. dare not climb up high to you'' -''-'' I dare not compare myself to you\n*{{Ruby|\u4e45\u4ef0\u5927\u540d|ji\u00fay\u01ceng d\u00e0m\u00edng}}'': Lit. long admired big name --'' I've known and admired you for a long time; used when meeting someone you've heard of (not necessarily admired).\n*{{Ruby|\u9ad8\u64e1\u8cb4\u624b|g\u0101ot\u00e1i gu\u00ecsh\u01d2u}}'': Lit. lift up high honorable hand --'' Please be magnanimous and don't hurt me (i.e., stop doing what you intend to do to me)\n\n=== Elegant Language ===\n{{Ruby|\u96c5\u8a9e|y\u00e1y\u016d}} - Elegant Language employs elegant or beautiful expressions and words in lieu of everyday casual words and phrases to describe people, objects, actions or concepts. It is often used on occasions where casual language may be inappropriate. Due to the lack of equivalent expressions in English, the translated phrases often do not convey the same sense of beauty or elegance. Examples:\n\n*{{Ruby|\u7d05\u9854\u77e5\u5df1|h\u00f3ngy\u00e1n zh\u012bj\u01d0}}: ''Lit. red face / know self'' -- beautiful beloved girlfriend (\"red\" refers to the make up or the natural color on a beautiful young woman's face; \"know self\" means someone who knows one well as in the close friendship between lovers). Compared to the casual alternative: \u60c5\u4eba or \u5973\u670b\u53cb (lover / girlfriend)\n*{{Ruby|\u8acb\u7528\u8336|q\u012dng y\u00f2ngch\u00e1}}: ''Lit please use tea'' -- please have some tea. Compared to the casual alternative: \u559d\u8336\u5427 (''Lit. \"drink tea\"'')\n*{{Ruby|\u8acb\u6162\u7528|q\u01d0ng m\u00e0ny\u00f2ng}}: ''Lit. please take your time to use'' -- please enjoy [your meal]. Compared to the casual alternative: \u4f60\u4eec\u6162\u6162\u5403 (''Lit.'' ''\"you guys eat slowly\"'')\n*{{Ruby|\u8acb\u4ee3\u70ba\u7f8e\u8a00\u5e7e\u53e5|q\u012dng d\u00e0iw\u00e9i m\u0115iy\u00e1n j\u012dj\u00f9}}: ''Lit. please on my behalf beautify some of your language'' -- please say something nice about me/my situation in front of... Compared to the casual alternative: \u5e6b\u6211\u8aaa\u5e7e\u53e5\u597d\u8a71\u554a (''Lit. \"help me say some good words\"'')\n**\n\n== Honorific and Humble Forms of Address ==\n{{Ruby|\u656c\u8f9e|j\u00ecngc\u00ed}} (respectful vocabulary) and {{Ruby|\u8c26\u8f9e|qi\u0101nc\u00ed}} (humble vocabulary) are frequently found in the various forms of address in the Chinese language. Below is a collection of the better known honorific forms of address that have been used at one time or another in the Chinese lexicon. Although many are obsolete in usage, most remain relevant in contemporary literature and in the understanding of the Chinese language. Pronunciations given are those of today's [[Mandarin Chinese]]. Because of the vast number and complexity, the list provided is intended for reference rather than completeness.  \n\n===First-Person===\nWhen referring to oneself in ancient China, people avoided first-person pronouns (\"I\", \"me\", \"we\", and \"us\"). Instead, a third-person descriptor was used, which varied according to the situation. Referring to oneself in the third-person could be used arrogantly as well, to assert one's superiority or dominance over one's audience. This was most common in the imperial middle management {{ndash}} the imperial consorts, the military, and the imperial bureaucracy (e.g., \u672c\u5b98\uff0c\u672c\u5c06\u519b\uff0c\u672c\u5bab\uff0c\u672c\u5927\u723a), with the emperor instead often describing himself in sorrowful terms out of respect for his deceased father (e.g., \u5b64\u738b \"''This Orphaned King''\"\uff0c\u5be1\u4eba \"''This Lonesome Man''\").\n\nFor the same reasons, and to a much lesser degree, the first-person pronouns are sometimes avoided also in contemporary usage. Often, the generic self-referencing prefix \u672c~\uff0c\u8be5~\uff0c or a humble / self-deprecating prefix such as \u655d~ is used with a third-person descriptor, for example: \u672c\u4eba\u662f\u6765\u81ea\u7532\u516c\u53f8\u7684\uff0c\u655d\u516c\u53f8\u60f3\u8ddf\u60a8\u505a\u4e2a\u8bbf\u95ee\u3002-- Literally, \"''This person is from company A, this unkempt company would like to do an interview with you.''\" translated to \"''I am from company A, we would like to do an interview with you.''\"\n\nProvided below are some first-person honorific substitutes and usages. Their relevancy (i.e., contemporary vs. classical) and gender association are also indicated. Plurals (\"we\", \"us\") in classical Chinese are formed by the suffixes ~\u7b49 or ~\u4f17\u4eba etc., and in contemporary Chinese by ~\u4eec. A \"classical usage\" designation does not preclude usage in contemporary speech or writing, as contemporary Chinese often incorporates classical elements, though it is much less likely to be seen or used in the contemporary context. \n\n==== Commoners and the Humble ====\nThe following directly replace the pronoun \"I\" in usage by commoners or people of low social status. Example: rather than \u543e(\u6211)\u4ee5\u70ba\u6b64\u65b9\u4e0d\u53ef - \"''I think this idea will not work''\" one would say \u611a\u4ee5\u70ba\u6b64\u65b9\u4e0d\u53ef - \"''This unintelligent one thinks this idea will not work.''\"\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Often, the same honorific substitutes can be used for both second-person and third-person.\n\nIn contemporary Chinese (both spoken and written), the second-person singular pronoun {{lang|zh|\u4f60}} (''n\u01d0'', \"you\") can be substituted with its polite form {{lang|zh|\u60a8}} (''n\u01d0n'', \"you\" [cherished]) to express politeness. In some cases, the addressee's profession or title can be used. In others, specific honorific substitutes are used, e.g., \u9601\u4e0b (Lit. beneath your pavilion) is used instead of the pronoun \"you\" to show respect. Historically, many other honorific usages existed.\n\nIn contemporary usage, the pronouns \u4f60/\u60a8\uff0c\u4f60\u4eec\uff0c\u4ed6/\u5979\uff0cand \u4ed6/\u5979\u4eec are sometimes appended redundantly to the honorific substitute. For example, \u8bf7\u9601\u4e0b\u60a8\u6162\u8d70 - \u60a8 is optionally inserted after \u9601\u4e0b. This is likely out of a contemporary habit to use actual pronouns in speech.  \n\nProvided below are some of the better known second-person or third-person honorific substitutes and usages. \n\n==== Royalty ====\nThe following were honorifics used when people addressed the Royalty in ancient China. Often, imperial titles were also used as pronoun substitutes. For example, the emperor may address the empress by her title \u7687\u540e. A royal servant may address a princess as \u516c\u4e3b. Not all royal titles are listed. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Traditional Chinese !! Simplified Chinese !! Pinyin\n!Literal Meaning!! Meaning in Usage\n!Gender\n!Contemporary or Classical Usage!!

Some may have shown up in pronoun discussions. While noun modifiers are technically adjectives, honorific prefixes/suffixes are different from normal adjectives in that they become part of the noun in usage, and the meaning of the modifying prefix/suffix is usually not taken literally - only added functionally to show respect or humility. Because Chinese words are usually formed also by combining multiple root characters (each with a literal meaning), it is not always immediately apparent when using a polite version of a word that an honorific modifier is in use.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

That is, for sets of points that define a smooth shape or a shape that has a small number of corners\u2014the shapes of traditional geometry and science\u2014the Hausdorff dimension is an [[integer]] agreeing with the usual sense of dimension, also known as the [[Inductive dimension|topological dimension]]. However, formulas have also been developed that allow calculation of the dimension of other less simple objects, where, solely on the basis of their properties of [[scaling (geometry)|scaling]] and [[self-similarity]], one is led to the conclusion that particular objects\u2014including [[fractal]]s\u2014have non-integer Hausdorff dimensions. Because of the significant technical advances made by [[Abram Samoilovitch Besicovitch]] allowing computation of dimensions for highly irregular or \"rough\" sets, this dimension is also commonly referred to as the ''Hausdorff\u2013Besicovitch dimension.''\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension, more specifically, is a further dimensional number associated with a given set, where the distances between all members of that set are defined. Such a set is termed a [[metric space]]. The dimension is drawn from the [[Extended real number line|extended real numbers]], <math>\\overline{\\mathbb{R}}</math>, as opposed to the more intuitive notion of dimension, which is not associated to general metric spaces, and only takes values in the non-negative integers.\n\nIn mathematical terms, the Hausdorff dimension generalizes the notion of the dimension of a real [[vector space]]. That is, the Hausdorff dimension of an ''n''-dimensional [[inner product space]] equals ''n''. This underlies the earlier statement that the Hausdorff dimension of a point is zero, of a line is one, etc., and that [[fractal|irregular sets]] can have noninteger Hausdorff dimensions. For instance, the [[Koch snowflake]] shown at right is constructed from an equilateral triangle; in each iteration, its component line segments are divided into 3 segments of unit length, the newly created middle segment is used as the base of a new [[equilateral]] triangle that points outward, and this base segment is then deleted to leave a final object from the iteration of unit length of 4.<ref>Larry Riddle, 2014, \"Classic Iterated Function Systems: Koch Snowflake\", Agnes Scott College e-Academy (online), see [http://ecademy.agnesscott.edu/~lriddle/ifs/ksnow/ksnow.htm], accessed 5 March 2015.</ref> That is, after the first iteration, each original line segment has been replaced with N=4, where each self-similar copy is 1/S = 1/3 as long as the original.<ref name=CampbellAnnenberg15/> Stated another way, we have taken an object with Euclidean dimension, D, and reduced its linear scale by 1/3 in each direction, so that its length increases to N=S<sup>D</sup>.<ref name=ClaytonSCTPLS96>Keith Clayton, 1996, \"Fractals and the Fractal Dimension,\" ''Basic Concepts in Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos'' (workshop), Society for Chaos Theory in Psychology and the Life Sciences annual meeting, June 28, 1996, Berkeley, California, see [http://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/psychology/cogsci/chaos/workshop/Workshop.html], accessed 5 March 2015.</ref> This equation is easily solved for D, yielding the ratio of logarithms (or [[natural logarithm]]s) appearing in the figures, and giving\u2014in the Koch and other fractal cases\u2014non-integer dimensions for these objects.\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension is a successor to the simpler, but usually equivalent, box-counting or [[Minkowski\u2013Bouligand dimension]].\n\n==Intuition==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}\nThe intuitive concept of dimension of a geometric object ''X'' is the number of independent parameters one needs to pick out a unique point inside. However, any point specified by two parameters can be instead specified by one, because the [[cardinality]] of the [[real plane]] is equal to the cardinality of the [[real line]] (this can be seen by an [[Cantor's diagonal argument|argument]] involving interweaving the digits of two numbers to yield a single number encoding the same information). The example of a [[space-filling curve]] shows that one can even map the real line to the real plane [[Surjective function|surjectively]] (taking one real number into a pair of real numbers in a way so that all pairs of numbers are covered) and ''continuously'', so that a one-dimensional object completely fills up a higher-dimensional object.\n\nEvery space filling curve hits some points multiple times, and does not have a continuous inverse. It is impossible to map two dimensions onto one in a way that is continuous and continuously invertible. The topological dimension, also called [[Lebesgue covering dimension]], explains why. This dimension is ''n'' if, in every covering of ''X'' by small open balls, there is at least one point where ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 balls overlap. For example, when one covers a line with short open intervals, some points must be covered twice, giving dimension&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.\n\nBut topological dimension is a very crude measure of the local size of a space (size near a point). A curve that is almost space-filling can still have topological dimension one, even if it fills up most of the area of a region. A [[fractal]] has an integer topological dimension, but in terms of the amount of space it takes up, it behaves like a higher-dimensional space.\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension measures the local size of a space taking into account the distance between points, the [[metric space|metric]]. Consider the number ''N''(''r'') of [[ball (mathematics)|balls]] of radius at most ''r'' required to cover ''X'' completely. When ''r'' is very small, ''N''(''r'') grows polynomially with 1/''r''. For a sufficiently well-behaved  ''X'', the Hausdorff dimension is the unique number ''d'' such that N(''r'') grows as 1/''r<sup>d</sup>'' as ''r'' approaches zero. More precisely, this defines the [[Minkowski\u2013Bouligand dimension|box-counting dimension]], which equals the Hausdorff dimension when the value ''d'' is a critical boundary between growth rates that are insufficient to cover the space, and growth rates that are overabundant.\n\nFor shapes that are smooth, or shapes with a small number of corners, the shapes of traditional geometry and science, the Hausdorff dimension is an integer agreeing with the topological dimension. But [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] observed that [[fractal]]s, sets with noninteger Hausdorff dimensions, are found everywhere in nature.

That is, for sets of points that define a smooth shape or a shape that has a small number of corners\u2014the shapes of traditional geometry and science\u2014the Hausdorff dimension is an [[integer]] agreeing with the usual sense of dimension, also known as the [[Inductive dimension|topological dimension]]. However, formulas have also been developed that allow calculation of the dimension of other less simple objects, where, solely on the basis of their properties of [[scaling (geometry)|scaling]] and [[self-similarity]], one is led to the conclusion that particular objects\u2014including [[fractal]]s\u2014have non-integer Hausdorff dimensions. Because of the significant technical advances made by [[Abram Samoilovitch Besicovitch]] allowing computation of dimensions for highly irregular or \"rough\" sets, this dimension is also commonly referred to as the ''Hausdorff\u2013Besicovitch dimension.''\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension, more specifically, is a further dimensional number associated with a given set, where the distances between all members of that set are defined. Such a set is termed a [[metric space]]. The dimension is drawn from the [[Extended real number line|extended real numbers]], <math>\\overline{\\mathbb{R}}</math>, as opposed to the more intuitive notion of dimension, which is not associated to general metric spaces, and only takes values in the non-negative integers.\n\nIn mathematical terms, the Hausdorff dimension generalizes the notion of the dimension of a real [[vector space]]. That is, the Hausdorff dimension of an ''n''-dimensional [[inner product space]] equals ''n''. This underlies the earlier statement that the Hausdorff dimension of a point is zero, of a line is one, etc., and that [[fractal|irregular sets]] can have noninteger Hausdorff dimensions. For instance, the [[Koch snowflake]] shown at right is constructed from an equilateral triangle; in each iteration, its component line segments are divided into 3 segments of unit length, the newly created middle segment is used as the base of a new [[equilateral]] triangle that points outward, and this base segment is then deleted to leave a final object from the iteration of unit length of 4.<ref>Larry Riddle, 2014, \"Classic Iterated Function Systems: Koch Snowflake\", Agnes Scott College e-Academy (online), see [http://ecademy.agnesscott.edu/~lriddle/ifs/ksnow/ksnow.htm], accessed 5 March 2015.</ref> That is, after the first iteration, each original line segment has been replaced with N=4, where each self-similar copy is 1/S = 1/3 as long as the original.<ref name=CampbellAnnenberg15/> Stated another way, we have taken an object with Euclidean dimension, D, and reduced its linear scale by 1/3 in each direction, so that its length increases to N=S<sup>D</sup>.<ref name=ClaytonSCTPLS96>Keith Clayton, 1996, \"Fractals and the Fractal Dimension,\" ''Basic Concepts in Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos'' (workshop), Society for Chaos Theory in Psychology and the Life Sciences annual meeting, June 28, 1996, Berkeley, California, see [http://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/psychology/cogsci/chaos/workshop/Workshop.html], accessed 5 March 2015.</ref> This equation is easily solved for D, yielding the ratio of logarithms (or [[natural logarithm]]s) appearing in the figures, and giving\u2014in the Koch and other fractal cases\u2014non-integer dimensions for these objects.\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension is a successor to the simpler, but usually equivalent, box-counting or [[Minkowski\u2013Bouligand dimension]].\n\n==Intuition==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}\nThe intuitive concept of dimension of a geometric object ''X'' is the number of independent parameters one needs to pick out a unique point inside. However, any point specified by two parameters can be instead specified by one, because the [[cardinality]] of the [[real plane]] is equal to the cardinality of the [[real line]] (this can be seen by an [[Cantor's diagonal argument|argument]] involving interweaving the digits of two numbers to yield a single number encoding the same information). The example of a [[space-filling curve]] shows that one can even map the real line to the real plane [[Surjective function|surjectively]] (taking one real number into a pair of real numbers in a way so that all pairs of numbers are covered) and ''continuously'', so that a one-dimensional object completely fills up a higher-dimensional object.\n\nEvery space filling curve hits some points multiple times, and does not have a continuous inverse. It is impossible to map two dimensions onto one in a way that is continuous and continuously invertible. The topological dimension, also called [[Lebesgue covering dimension]], explains why. This dimension is ''n'' if, in every covering of ''X'' by small open balls, there is at least one point where ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 balls overlap. For example, when one covers a line with short open intervals, some points must be covered twice, giving dimension&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.\n\nBut topological dimension is a very crude measure of the local size of a space (size near a point). A curve that is almost space-filling can still have topological dimension one, even if it fills up most of the area of a region. A [[fractal]] has an integer topological dimension, but in terms of the amount of space it takes up, it behaves like a higher-dimensional space.\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension measures the local size of a space taking into account the distance between points, the [[metric space|metric]]. Consider the number ''N''(''r'') of [[ball (mathematics)|balls]] of radius at most ''r'' required to cover ''X'' completely. When ''r'' is very small, ''N''(''r'') grows polynomially with 1/''r''. For a sufficiently well-behaved  ''X'', the Hausdorff dimension is the unique number ''d'' such that N(''r'') grows as 1/''r<sup>d</sup>'' as ''r'' approaches zero. More precisely, this defines the [[Minkowski\u2013Bouligand dimension|box-counting dimension]], which equals the Hausdorff dimension when the value ''d'' is a critical boundary between growth rates that are insufficient to cover the space, and growth rates that are overabundant.\n\nFor shapes that are smooth, or shapes with a small number of corners, the shapes of traditional geometry and science, the Hausdorff dimension is an integer agreeing with the topological dimension. But [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] observed that [[fractal]]s, sets with noninteger Hausdorff dimensions, are found everywhere in nature. He observed that the proper idealization of most rough shapes you see around you is not in terms of smooth idealized shapes, but in terms of fractal idealized shapes:\n\n<blockquote>Clouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not circles, and bark is not smooth, nor does lightning travel in a straight line.<ref name=\"mandelbrot\">{{cite book   | last = Mandelbrot   | first = Beno\u00eet   | authorlink = Benoit Mandelbrot   | title = The Fractal Geometry of Nature   | publisher = W.

Quantum circuits are based on the quantum bit, or \"[[qubit]]\", which is somewhat analogous to the [[bit]] in classical computation. Qubits can be in a 1 or 0 [[quantum state]], or they can be in a [[quantum superposition|superposition]] of the 1 and 0 states. However, when qubits are measured the result is always either a 0 or a 1; the [[Probability|probabilities]] of these two outcomes depend on the [[quantum state]] that they were in immediately prior to the measurement. Computation is performed by manipulating qubits with [[quantum logic gate]]s, which are somewhat analogous to [[logic gate|classical logic gates]].\n\n<!--Physical implementations-->\nThere are currently two main approaches to physically implementing a quantum computer: analog and digital. Analog approaches are further divided into [[quantum simulator|quantum simulation]], [[quantum annealing]], and [[adiabatic quantum computation]]. Digital quantum computers use [[quantum logic gate]]s to do computation. Both approaches use quantum bits or [[qubit]]s.<ref name=2018Report/>{{rp|2\u201313}}\n\n<!-- Computability and complexity -->\nAny [[computational problem]] that can be solved by a classical computer can also, in principle, be solved by a quantum computer. Conversely, quantum computers obey the [[Church\u2013Turing thesis|Church\u2013Turing thesis;]] that is, any [[computational problem]] that can be solved by a quantum computer can also be solved by a classical computer. While this means that quantum computers provide no additional power over classical computers in terms of [[computability]], they do in theory provide additional power when it comes to the [[time complexity]] of solving certain problems. Notably, quantum computers are believed to be able to quickly solve certain problems that no classical computer could solve in ''any feasible amount of time''\u2014a feat known as \"[[quantum supremacy]]\".

We may represent the state of this memory using [[Bra\u2013ket notation|Dirac notation]] so that\n<math display=\"block\">\n |0\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |1\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\nA quantum memory may then be found in any quantum superposition <math display=\"inline\">|\\psi\\rangle</math> of the two classical states <math display=\"inline\">|0\\rangle</math> and <math display=\"inline\">|1\\rangle</math>:\n<math display=\"block\">\n |\\psi\\rangle := \\alpha\\,|0\\rangle + \\beta\\,|1\\rangle\n               = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha \\\\ \\beta \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1.\n</math>\nIn general, the coefficients <math display=\"inline\">\\alpha</math> and <math display=\"inline\">\\beta</math> are [[complex number]]s. In this scenario, one [[qubit]] of information is said to be encoded into the quantum memory. The state <math display=\"inline\">|\\psi\\rangle</math> is not itself a probability vector but can be connected with a probability vector via a measurement operation. If the quantum memory is measured to determine if the state is <math display=\"inline\">|0\\rangle</math> or <math display=\"inline\">|1\\rangle</math> (this is known as a computational basis measurement), the zero state would be observed with probability <math display=\"inline\">|\\alpha|^2</math> and the one state with probability <math display=\"inline\">|\\beta|^2</math>. The numbers <math display=\"inline\">\\alpha</math> and <math display=\"inline\">\\beta</math> are called [[Probability amplitude|quantum amplitudes]].\n\nThe state of this one-qubit quantum memory can be manipulated by applying [[quantum logic gate]]s, analogous to how classical memory can be manipulated with [[Logic gate|classical logic gates]]. One important gate for both classical and quantum computation is the NOT gate, which can be represented by a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]\n<math display=\"block\">X := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\nMathematically, the application of such a logic gate to a quantum state vector is modelled with [[matrix multiplication]]. Thus <math display=\"inline\">X|0\\rangle = |1\\rangle</math> and <math display=\"inline\">X|1\\rangle = |0\\rangle</math>.\n\nThe mathematics of single qubit gates can be extended to operate on multiqubit quantum memories in two important ways. One way is simply to select a qubit and apply that gate to the target qubit whilst leaving the remainder of the memory unaffected. Another way is to apply the gate to its target only if another part of the memory is in a desired state. These two choices can be illustrated using another example. The possible states of a two-qubit quantum memory are\n<math display=\"block\">\n |00\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |01\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |10\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |11\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n</math>\nThe CNOT gate can then be represented using the following matrix:\n<math display=\"block\">\n CNOT :=\n \\begin{pmatrix}\n   1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n   0 & 0 & 1 & 0\n \\end{pmatrix}.\n</math>\nAs a mathematical consequence of this definition, <math display=\"inline\">CNOT|00\\rangle = |00\\rangle</math>, <math display=\"inline\">CNOT|01\\rangle = |01\\rangle</math>, <math display=\"inline\">CNOT|10\\rangle = |11\\rangle</math>, and <math display=\"inline\">CNOT|11\\rangle = |10\\rangle</math>. In other words, the CNOT applies a NOT gate (<math display=\"inline\">X</math> from before) to the second qubit if and only if the first qubit is in the state <math display=\"inline\">|1\\rangle</math>. If the first qubit is <math display=\"inline\">|0\\rangle</math>, nothing is done to either qubit.\n\nIn summary, a quantum computation can be described as a network of quantum logic gates and measurements. Any measurement can be deferred to the end of a quantum computation, though this deferment may come at a computational cost. Because of this possibility of deferring a measurement, most [[quantum circuit]]s depict a network consisting only of quantum logic gates and no measurements. More information can be found in the following articles: [[universal quantum computer]], [[Shor's algorithm]], [[Grover's algorithm]], [[Deutsch\u2013Jozsa algorithm]], [[amplitude amplification]], [[quantum Fourier transform]], [[quantum gate]], [[Adiabatic quantum computation|quantum adiabatic algorithm]] and [[quantum error correction]].\n\nAny quantum computation can be represented as a network of quantum logic gates from a fairly small family of gates. A choice of gate family that enables this construction is known as a [[Quantum logic gate#Universal quantum gates|universal gate set]]. One common such set includes all single-qubit gates as well as the CNOT gate from above. This means any quantum computation can be performed by executing a sequence of single-qubit gates together with CNOT gates. Though this gate set is infinite, it can be replaced with a finite gate set by appealing to the [[Solovay\u2013Kitaev theorem|Solovay-Kitaev theorem]].\n\n== Potential applications ==\n=== Cryptography ===\n{{Main|Quantum cryptography}}\n[[Integer factorization]], which underpins the security of [[public key cryptography|public key cryptographic]] systems, is believed to be computationally infeasible with an ordinary computer for large integers if they are the product of few [[prime number]]s (e.g., products of two 300-digit primes).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lenstra |first=Arjen K. |url=http://sage.math.washington.edu/edu/124/misc/arjen_lenstra_factoring.pdf |title=Integer Factoring |journal=Designs, Codes and Cryptography |volume=19 |pages=101\u2013128 |year=2000 |doi=10.1023/A:1008397921377 |issue=2/3 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410234239/http://sage.math.washington.edu/edu/124/misc/arjen_lenstra_factoring.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-10 }}</ref> By comparison, a quantum computer could efficiently solve this problem using [[Shor's algorithm]] to find its factors. This ability would allow a quantum computer to break many of the [[cryptography|cryptographic]] systems in use today, in the sense that there would be a [[polynomial time]] (in the number of digits of the integer) algorithm for solving the problem. In particular, most of the popular [[Asymmetric Algorithms|public key ciphers]] are based on the difficulty of factoring integers or the [[discrete logarithm]] problem, both of which can be solved by Shor's algorithm. In particular, the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]], [[Diffie\u2013Hellman]], and [[elliptic curve Diffie\u2013Hellman]] algorithms could be broken. These are used to protect secure Web pages, encrypted email, and many other types of data. Breaking these would have significant ramifications for electronic privacy and security.\n\nHowever, [[Post-quantum cryptography|other cryptographic algorithms]] do not appear to be broken by those algorithms.<ref name=\"pqcrypto_survey\">Daniel J.

The most well-known example of this is ''quantum database search'', which can be solved by [[Grover's algorithm]] using quadratically fewer queries to the database than that are required by classical algorithms. In this case, the advantage is not only provable but also optimal, it has been shown that Grover's algorithm gives the maximal possible probability of finding the desired element for any number of oracle lookups. Several other examples of provable quantum speedups for query problems have subsequently been discovered, such as for finding collisions in two-to-one functions and evaluating NAND trees.\n\nProblems that can be addressed with [[Grover's algorithm]] have the following properties:\n#There is no searchable structure in the collection of possible answers,\n#The number of possible answers to check is the same as the number of inputs to the algorithm, and\n#There exists a boolean function which evaluates each input and determines whether it is the correct answer\n\nFor problems with all these properties, the running time of [[Grover's algorithm]] on a quantum computer will scale as the square root of the number of inputs (or elements in the database), as opposed to the linear scaling of classical algorithms. A general class of problems to which [[Grover's algorithm]] can be applied<ref>{{Cite arxiv |eprint = quant-ph/0504012|last1 = Ambainis|first1 = Andris|title = Quantum search algorithms|year = 2005}}</ref> is [[Boolean satisfiability problem]]. In this instance, the ''database'' through which the algorithm is iterating is that of all possible answers. An example (and possible) application of this is a [[Password cracking|password cracker]] that attempts to guess the password or secret key for an [[encryption|encrypted]] file or system. [[Symmetric-key algorithm|Symmetric ciphers]] such as [[Triple DES]] and [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] are particularly vulnerable to this kind of attack.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} This application of quantum computing is a major interest of government agencies.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-seeks-to-build-quantum-computer-that-could-crack-most-types-of-encryption/2014/01/02/8fff297e-7195-11e3-8def-a33011492df2_story.html?hpid=z1 |title=NSA seeks to build quantum computer that could crack most types of encryption |first1=Steven |last1=Rich |first2=Barton |last2=Gellman |date=2014-02-01 |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref>\n\n=== Quantum simulation ===\n{{Main|Quantum simulator}}\nSince chemistry and nanotechnology rely on understanding quantum systems, and such systems are impossible to simulate in an efficient manner classically, many believe [[Quantum simulator|quantum simulation]] will be one of the most important applications of quantum computing.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://archive.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/02/72734 |title=The Father of Quantum Computing |journal=Wired |first=Quinn |last=Norton |date=2007-02-15 }}</ref> Quantum simulation could also be used to simulate the behavior of atoms and particles at unusual conditions such as the reactions inside a [[collider]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ias.edu/ias-letter/ambainis-quantum-computing |title=What Can We Do with a Quantum Computer? |first=Andris |last=Ambainis |date=Spring 2014 |publisher=Institute for Advanced Study}}</ref>\n\n=== Quantum annealing and adiabatic optimization ===\n[[Quantum annealing]] or [[Adiabatic quantum computation]] relies on the adiabatic theorem to undertake calculations.

This usually means isolating the system from its environment as interactions with the external world cause the system to decohere. However, other sources of decoherence also exist. Examples include the quantum gates, and the lattice vibrations and background thermonuclear spin of the physical system used to implement the qubits. Decoherence is irreversible, as it is effectively non-unitary, and is usually something that should be highly controlled, if not avoided. Decoherence times for candidate systems in particular, the transverse relaxation time ''T''<sub>2</sub> (for [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] and [[MRI]] technology, also called the ''dephasing time''), typically range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperature.<ref name=\"DiVincenzo 1995\">{{cite journal |last=DiVincenzo |first=David P. |title=Quantum Computation |journal=Science |year=1995 |volume=270 |issue=5234 |pages=255\u2013261 |doi= 10.1126/science.270.5234.255 |bibcode = 1995Sci...270..255D |citeseerx=10.1.1.242.2165 }} {{subscription required}}</ref> Currently, some quantum computers require their qubits to be cooled to 20 millikelvins in order to prevent significant decoherence.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Nicola|title=Computing: The quantum company|journal=Nature|date=19 June 2013|volume=498|issue=7454|pages=286\u2013288|doi=10.1038/498286a|pmid=23783610|bibcode=2013Natur.498..286J|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nAs a result, time-consuming tasks may render some quantum algorithms inoperable, as maintaining the state of qubits for a long enough duration will eventually corrupt the superpositions.<ref>{{cite arxiv|last1=Amy|first1=Matthew|last2=Matteo|first2=Olivia|last3=Gheorghiu|first3=Vlad|last4=Mosca|first4=Michele|last5=Parent|first5=Alex|last6=Schanck|first6=John|title=Estimating the cost of generic quantum pre-image attacks on SHA-2 and SHA-3|date=November 30, 2016|eprint=1603.09383|class=quant-ph}}</ref>\n\nThese issues are more difficult for optical approaches as the timescales are orders of magnitude shorter and an often-cited approach to overcoming them is optical [[pulse shaping]]. Error rates are typically proportional to the ratio of operating time to decoherence time, hence any operation must be completed much more quickly than the decoherence time.\n\nAs described in the [[Quantum threshold theorem]], if the error rate is small enough, it is thought to be possible to use quantum error correction to suppress errors and decoherence. This allows the total calculation time to be longer than the decoherence time if the error correction scheme can correct errors faster than decoherence introduces them. An often cited figure for the required error rate in each gate for fault-tolerant computation is 10<sup>\u22123</sup>, assuming the noise is depolarizing.\n\nMeeting this scalability condition is possible for a wide range of systems. However, the use of error correction brings with it the cost of a greatly increased number of required qubits. The number required to factor integers using Shor's algorithm is still polynomial, and thought to be between ''L'' and ''L''<sup>2</sup>, where ''L'' is the number of qubits in the number to be factored; error correction algorithms would inflate this figure by an additional factor of ''L''. For a 1000-bit number, this implies a need for about 10<sup>4</sup> bits without error correction.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Is Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation Really Possible? |last=Dyakonov |first=M.

More formally, BQP is the class of problems that can be solved by a polynomial-time [[quantum Turing machine]] with error probability of at most 1/3. As a class of probabilistic problems, BQP is the quantum counterpart to [[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]] (\"bounded error, probabilistic, polynomial time\"), the class of problems that can be efficiently solved by [[probabilistic Turing machine]]s with bounded error.<ref>Nielsen, p. 41</ref> It is known that BPP<math>\\subseteq</math>BQP and widely suspected, but not proven, that BQP<math>\\nsubseteq</math>BPP, which intuitively would mean that quantum computers are more powerful than classical computers in terms of time complexity.<ref>Nielsen, p. 201</ref>\n\n<!-- Relation of BQP to basic complexity classes -->\n[[File:BQP complexity class diagram.svg|thumb|The suspected relationship of BQP to several classical complexity classes.<ref>Nielsen, p. 42</ref>]]\nThe exact relationship of BQP to [[P (complexity)|P]], [[NP (complexity)|NP]], and [[PSPACE (complexity)|PSPACE]] is not known. However, it is known that P<math>\\subseteq</math>BQP<math>\\subseteq</math>PSPACE; that is, the class of problems that can be efficiently solved by quantum computers includes all problems that can be efficiently solved by deterministic classical computers but does not include any problems that cannot be solved by classical computers with polynomial space resources. It is further suspected that BQP is a strict superset of P, meaning there are problems that are efficiently solvable by quantum computers that are not efficiently solvable by deterministic classical computers. For instance, [[integer factorization]] and the [[discrete logarithm problem]] are known to be in BQP and are suspected to be outside of P. On the relationship of BQP to NP, little is known beyond the fact that some NP problems are in BQP (integer factorization and the discrete logarithm problem are both in NP, for example). It is suspected that NP<math>\\nsubseteq</math>BQP; that is, it is believed that there are efficiently checkable problems that are not efficiently solvable by a quantum computer. As a direct consequence of this belief, it is also suspected that BQP is disjoint from the class of [[NP-complete]] problems (if an NP-complete problem were in BQP, then it follows from [[NP-hard|NP-hardness]] that all problems in NP are in BQP).<ref name=BernVazi>{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Ethan |last2=Vazirani |first2=Umesh |doi=10.1137/S0097539796300921 |title=Quantum Complexity Theory |year=1997 |pages=1411\u20131473 |volume=26 |journal=SIAM Journal on Computing |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/bv.ps |issue=5|citeseerx=10.1.1.144.7852 }}</ref>\n\n<!-- Summary of relationship to essential complexity classes -->\nThe relationship of BQP to the basic classical complexity classes can be summarized as:\n:<math>\\mathsf{P \\subseteq BPP \\subseteq BQP \\subseteq PP \\subseteq PSPACE}</math>\nIt is also known that BQP is contained in the complexity class ''[[Sharp-P|#P]]'' (or more precisely in the associated class of decision problems ''P<sup>#P</sup>''),<ref name=BernVazi>{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Ethan |last2=Vazirani |first2=Umesh |doi=10.1137/S0097539796300921 |title=Quantum Complexity Theory |year=1997 |pages=1411\u20131473 |volume=26 |journal=SIAM Journal on Computing |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/bv.ps |issue=5|citeseerx=10.1.1.144.7852 }}</ref> which is a subclass of [[PSPACE]].\n\n<!-- Speculation about more advanced types of quantum computers -->\nIt has been speculated that further advances in physics could lead to even faster computers.

Quantum circuits are based on the quantum bit, or \"[[qubit]]\", which is somewhat analogous to the [[bit]] in classical computation. Qubits can be in a 1 or 0 [[quantum state]], or they can be in a [[quantum superposition|superposition]] of the 1 and 0 states. However, when qubits are measured the result is always either a 0 or a 1; the [[Probability|probabilities]] of these two outcomes depend on the [[quantum state]] that they were in immediately prior to the measurement. Computation is performed by manipulating qubits with [[quantum logic gate]]s, which are somewhat analogous to [[logic gate|classical logic gates]].\n\n<!--Physical implementations-->\nThere are currently two main approaches to physically implementing a quantum computer: analog and digital. Analog approaches are further divided into [[quantum simulator|quantum simulation]], [[quantum annealing]], and [[adiabatic quantum computation]]. Digital quantum computers use [[quantum logic gate]]s to do computation. Both approaches use quantum bits or [[qubit]]s.<ref name=2018Report/>{{rp|2\u201313}}\n\n<!-- Computability and complexity -->\nAny [[computational problem]] that can be solved by a classical computer can also, in principle, be solved by a quantum computer. Conversely, quantum computers obey the [[Church\u2013Turing thesis|Church\u2013Turing thesis;]] that is, any [[computational problem]] that can be solved by a quantum computer can also be solved by a classical computer. While this means that quantum computers provide no additional power over classical computers in terms of [[computability]], they do in theory provide additional power when it comes to the [[time complexity]] of solving certain problems. Notably, quantum computers are believed to be able to quickly solve certain problems that no classical computer could solve in ''any feasible amount of time''\u2014a feat known as \"[[quantum supremacy]]\". The study of the [[computational complexity]] of problems with respect to quantum computers is known as [[quantum complexity theory]].\n\n== Quantum operations ==\n[[File:Bloch Sphere.svg|thumb|The [[Bloch sphere]] is a representation of a [[qubit]], the fundamental building block of quantum computers.]]\n\nThe prevailing model of quantum computation describes the computation in terms of a network of [[quantum logic gate]]s.<ref name=\"Nielson-Chuang\">{{Cite book|title=Quantum Computation and Quantum Information: 10th Anniversary Edition|last=Nielsen|first=Michael A.|last2=Chuang|first2=Isaac L.|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511976667|location=Cambridge|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511976667|url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/465953}}</ref>\n\nA memory consisting of <math display=\"inline\">n</math> bits of information has <math display=\"inline\">2^n</math> possible states. A vector representing all memory states thus has <math display=\"inline\">2^n</math> entries (one for each state). This vector is viewed as a ''[[probability vector]]'' and represents the fact that the memory is to be found in a particular state.\n\nIn the classical view, one entry would have a value of 1 (i.e. a 100% probability of being in this state) and all other entries would be zero.  \nIn quantum mechanics, probability vectors are generalized to [[Density matrix|density operators]]. This is the technically rigorous [[Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|mathematical foundation for quantum logic gates]], but the intermediate quantum state vector formalism is usually introduced first because it is conceptually simpler. This article focuses on the quantum state vector formalism for simplicity.\n\nWe begin by considering a simple memory consisting of only one bit. This memory may be found in one of two states: the zero state or the one state. We may represent the state of this memory using [[Bra\u2013ket notation|Dirac notation]] so that\n<math display=\"block\">\n |0\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |1\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\nA quantum memory may then be found in any quantum superposition <math display=\"inline\">|\\psi\\rangle</math> of the two classical states <math display=\"inline\">|0\\rangle</math> and <math display=\"inline\">|1\\rangle</math>:\n<math display=\"block\">\n |\\psi\\rangle := \\alpha\\,|0\\rangle + \\beta\\,|1\\rangle\n               = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha \\\\ \\beta \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1.\n</math>\nIn general, the coefficients <math display=\"inline\">\\alpha</math> and <math display=\"inline\">\\beta</math> are [[complex number]]s. In this scenario, one [[qubit]] of information is said to be encoded into the quantum memory. The state <math display=\"inline\">|\\psi\\rangle</math> is not itself a probability vector but can be connected with a probability vector via a measurement operation. If the quantum memory is measured to determine if the state is <math display=\"inline\">|0\\rangle</math> or <math display=\"inline\">|1\\rangle</math> (this is known as a computational basis measurement), the zero state would be observed with probability <math display=\"inline\">|\\alpha|^2</math> and the one state with probability <math display=\"inline\">|\\beta|^2</math>. The numbers <math display=\"inline\">\\alpha</math> and <math display=\"inline\">\\beta</math> are called [[Probability amplitude|quantum amplitudes]].\n\nThe state of this one-qubit quantum memory can be manipulated by applying [[quantum logic gate]]s, analogous to how classical memory can be manipulated with [[Logic gate|classical logic gates]]. One important gate for both classical and quantum computation is the NOT gate, which can be represented by a [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]\n<math display=\"block\">X := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\nMathematically, the application of such a logic gate to a quantum state vector is modelled with [[matrix multiplication]]. Thus <math display=\"inline\">X|0\\rangle = |1\\rangle</math> and <math display=\"inline\">X|1\\rangle = |0\\rangle</math>.\n\nThe mathematics of single qubit gates can be extended to operate on multiqubit quantum memories in two important ways. One way is simply to select a qubit and apply that gate to the target qubit whilst leaving the remainder of the memory unaffected. Another way is to apply the gate to its target only if another part of the memory is in a desired state. These two choices can be illustrated using another example. The possible states of a two-qubit quantum memory are\n<math display=\"block\">\n |00\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |01\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |10\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix};\\quad\n |11\\rangle := \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n</math>\nThe CNOT gate can then be represented using the following matrix:\n<math display=\"block\">\n CNOT :=\n \\begin{pmatrix}\n   1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n   0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n   0 & 0 & 1 & 0\n \\end{pmatrix}.\n</math>\nAs a mathematical consequence of this definition, <math display=\"inline\">CNOT|00\\rangle = |00\\rangle</math>, <math display=\"inline\">CNOT|01\\rangle = |01\\rangle</math>, <math display=\"inline\">CNOT|10\\rangle = |11\\rangle</math>, and <math display=\"inline\">CNOT|11\\rangle = |10\\rangle</math>. In other words, the CNOT applies a NOT gate (<math display=\"inline\">X</math> from before) to the second qubit if and only if the first qubit is in the state <math display=\"inline\">|1\\rangle</math>. If the first qubit is <math display=\"inline\">|0\\rangle</math>, nothing is done to either qubit.\n\nIn summary, a quantum computation can be described as a network of quantum logic gates and measurements. Any measurement can be deferred to the end of a quantum computation, though this deferment may come at a computational cost. Because of this possibility of deferring a measurement, most [[quantum circuit]]s depict a network consisting only of quantum logic gates and no measurements. More information can be found in the following articles: [[universal quantum computer]], [[Shor's algorithm]], [[Grover's algorithm]], [[Deutsch\u2013Jozsa algorithm]], [[amplitude amplification]], [[quantum Fourier transform]], [[quantum gate]], [[Adiabatic quantum computation|quantum adiabatic algorithm]] and [[quantum error correction]].\n\nAny quantum computation can be represented as a network of quantum logic gates from a fairly small family of gates. A choice of gate family that enables this construction is known as a [[Quantum logic gate#Universal quantum gates|universal gate set]]. One common such set includes all single-qubit gates as well as the CNOT gate from above. This means any quantum computation can be performed by executing a sequence of single-qubit gates together with CNOT gates. Though this gate set is infinite, it can be replaced with a finite gate set by appealing to the [[Solovay\u2013Kitaev theorem|Solovay-Kitaev theorem]].\n\n== Potential applications ==\n=== Cryptography ===\n{{Main|Quantum cryptography}}\n[[Integer factorization]], which underpins the security of [[public key cryptography|public key cryptographic]] systems, is believed to be computationally infeasible with an ordinary computer for large integers if they are the product of few [[prime number]]s (e.g., products of two 300-digit primes).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lenstra |first=Arjen K. |url=http://sage.math.washington.edu/edu/124/misc/arjen_lenstra_factoring.pdf |title=Integer Factoring |journal=Designs, Codes and Cryptography |volume=19 |pages=101\u2013128 |year=2000 |doi=10.1023/A:1008397921377 |issue=2/3 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410234239/http://sage.math.washington.edu/edu/124/misc/arjen_lenstra_factoring.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-10 }}</ref> By comparison, a quantum computer could efficiently solve this problem using [[Shor's algorithm]] to find its factors. This ability would allow a quantum computer to break many of the [[cryptography|cryptographic]] systems in use today, in the sense that there would be a [[polynomial time]] (in the number of digits of the integer) algorithm for solving the problem. In particular, most of the popular [[Asymmetric Algorithms|public key ciphers]] are based on the difficulty of factoring integers or the [[discrete logarithm]] problem, both of which can be solved by Shor's algorithm. In particular, the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]], [[Diffie\u2013Hellman]], and [[elliptic curve Diffie\u2013Hellman]] algorithms could be broken. These are used to protect secure Web pages, encrypted email, and many other types of data. Breaking these would have significant ramifications for electronic privacy and security.\n\nHowever, [[Post-quantum cryptography|other cryptographic algorithms]] do not appear to be broken by those algorithms.<ref name=\"pqcrypto_survey\">Daniel J.

Several other examples of provable quantum speedups for query problems have subsequently been discovered, such as for finding collisions in two-to-one functions and evaluating NAND trees.\n\nProblems that can be addressed with [[Grover's algorithm]] have the following properties:\n#There is no searchable structure in the collection of possible answers,\n#The number of possible answers to check is the same as the number of inputs to the algorithm, and\n#There exists a boolean function which evaluates each input and determines whether it is the correct answer\n\nFor problems with all these properties, the running time of [[Grover's algorithm]] on a quantum computer will scale as the square root of the number of inputs (or elements in the database), as opposed to the linear scaling of classical algorithms. A general class of problems to which [[Grover's algorithm]] can be applied<ref>{{Cite arxiv |eprint = quant-ph/0504012|last1 = Ambainis|first1 = Andris|title = Quantum search algorithms|year = 2005}}</ref> is [[Boolean satisfiability problem]]. In this instance, the ''database'' through which the algorithm is iterating is that of all possible answers. An example (and possible) application of this is a [[Password cracking|password cracker]] that attempts to guess the password or secret key for an [[encryption|encrypted]] file or system.

This usually means isolating the system from its environment as interactions with the external world cause the system to decohere. However, other sources of decoherence also exist. Examples include the quantum gates, and the lattice vibrations and background thermonuclear spin of the physical system used to implement the qubits. Decoherence is irreversible, as it is effectively non-unitary, and is usually something that should be highly controlled, if not avoided. Decoherence times for candidate systems in particular, the transverse relaxation time ''T''<sub>2</sub> (for [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] and [[MRI]] technology, also called the ''dephasing time''), typically range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperature.<ref name=\"DiVincenzo 1995\">{{cite journal |last=DiVincenzo |first=David P. |title=Quantum Computation |journal=Science |year=1995 |volume=270 |issue=5234 |pages=255\u2013261 |doi= 10.1126/science.270.5234.255 |bibcode = 1995Sci...270..255D |citeseerx=10.1.1.242.2165 }} {{subscription required}}</ref> Currently, some quantum computers require their qubits to be cooled to 20 millikelvins in order to prevent significant decoherence.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Nicola|title=Computing: The quantum company|journal=Nature|date=19 June 2013|volume=498|issue=7454|pages=286\u2013288|doi=10.1038/498286a|pmid=23783610|bibcode=2013Natur.498..286J|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nAs a result, time-consuming tasks may render some quantum algorithms inoperable, as maintaining the state of qubits for a long enough duration will eventually corrupt the superpositions.<ref>{{cite arxiv|last1=Amy|first1=Matthew|last2=Matteo|first2=Olivia|last3=Gheorghiu|first3=Vlad|last4=Mosca|first4=Michele|last5=Parent|first5=Alex|last6=Schanck|first6=John|title=Estimating the cost of generic quantum pre-image attacks on SHA-2 and SHA-3|date=November 30, 2016|eprint=1603.09383|class=quant-ph}}</ref>\n\nThese issues are more difficult for optical approaches as the timescales are orders of magnitude shorter and an often-cited approach to overcoming them is optical [[pulse shaping]]. Error rates are typically proportional to the ratio of operating time to decoherence time, hence any operation must be completed much more quickly than the decoherence time.\n\nAs described in the [[Quantum threshold theorem]], if the error rate is small enough, it is thought to be possible to use quantum error correction to suppress errors and decoherence. This allows the total calculation time to be longer than the decoherence time if the error correction scheme can correct errors faster than decoherence introduces them. An often cited figure for the required error rate in each gate for fault-tolerant computation is 10<sup>\u22123</sup>, assuming the noise is depolarizing.\n\nMeeting this scalability condition is possible for a wide range of systems. However, the use of error correction brings with it the cost of a greatly increased number of required qubits. The number required to factor integers using Shor's algorithm is still polynomial, and thought to be between ''L'' and ''L''<sup>2</sup>, where ''L'' is the number of qubits in the number to be factored; error correction algorithms would inflate this figure by an additional factor of ''L''. For a 1000-bit number, this implies a need for about 10<sup>4</sup> bits without error correction.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Is Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation Really Possible? |last=Dyakonov |first=M.

More formally, BQP is the class of problems that can be solved by a polynomial-time [[quantum Turing machine]] with error probability of at most 1/3. As a class of probabilistic problems, BQP is the quantum counterpart to [[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]] (\"bounded error, probabilistic, polynomial time\"), the class of problems that can be efficiently solved by [[probabilistic Turing machine]]s with bounded error.<ref>Nielsen, p. 41</ref> It is known that BPP<math>\\subseteq</math>BQP and widely suspected, but not proven, that BQP<math>\\nsubseteq</math>BPP, which intuitively would mean that quantum computers are more powerful than classical computers in terms of time complexity.<ref>Nielsen, p. 201</ref>\n\n<!-- Relation of BQP to basic complexity classes -->\n[[File:BQP complexity class diagram.svg|thumb|The suspected relationship of BQP to several classical complexity classes.<ref>Nielsen, p. 42</ref>]]\nThe exact relationship of BQP to [[P (complexity)|P]], [[NP (complexity)|NP]], and [[PSPACE (complexity)|PSPACE]] is not known. However, it is known that P<math>\\subseteq</math>BQP<math>\\subseteq</math>PSPACE; that is, the class of problems that can be efficiently solved by quantum computers includes all problems that can be efficiently solved by deterministic classical computers but does not include any problems that cannot be solved by classical computers with polynomial space resources. It is further suspected that BQP is a strict superset of P, meaning there are problems that are efficiently solvable by quantum computers that are not efficiently solvable by deterministic classical computers. For instance, [[integer factorization]] and the [[discrete logarithm problem]] are known to be in BQP and are suspected to be outside of P. On the relationship of BQP to NP, little is known beyond the fact that some NP problems are in BQP (integer factorization and the discrete logarithm problem are both in NP, for example). It is suspected that NP<math>\\nsubseteq</math>BQP; that is, it is believed that there are efficiently checkable problems that are not efficiently solvable by a quantum computer. As a direct consequence of this belief, it is also suspected that BQP is disjoint from the class of [[NP-complete]] problems (if an NP-complete problem were in BQP, then it follows from [[NP-hard|NP-hardness]] that all problems in NP are in BQP).<ref name=BernVazi>{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Ethan |last2=Vazirani |first2=Umesh |doi=10.1137/S0097539796300921 |title=Quantum Complexity Theory |year=1997 |pages=1411\u20131473 |volume=26 |journal=SIAM Journal on Computing |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/bv.ps |issue=5|citeseerx=10.1.1.144.7852 }}</ref>\n\n<!-- Summary of relationship to essential complexity classes -->\nThe relationship of BQP to the basic classical complexity classes can be summarized as:\n:<math>\\mathsf{P \\subseteq BPP \\subseteq BQP \\subseteq PP \\subseteq PSPACE}</math>\nIt is also known that BQP is contained in the complexity class ''[[Sharp-P|#P]]'' (or more precisely in the associated class of decision problems ''P<sup>#P</sup>''),<ref name=BernVazi>{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Ethan |last2=Vazirani |first2=Umesh |doi=10.1137/S0097539796300921 |title=Quantum Complexity Theory |year=1997 |pages=1411\u20131473 |volume=26 |journal=SIAM Journal on Computing |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/bv.ps |issue=5|citeseerx=10.1.1.144.7852 }}</ref> which is a subclass of [[PSPACE]].\n\n<!-- Speculation about more advanced types of quantum computers -->\nIt has been speculated that further advances in physics could lead to even faster computers.
