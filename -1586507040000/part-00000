The company is a co-operative of the [[National Trades Union Congress]] (NTUC).

Then prime minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] opened the first supermarket at Block 192, Toa Payoh Lorong 4, and it was the first of its kind.<ref>Shapudin, Naqiyah 2013 'Back at the first store after 35 years', The New Paper 27 July. p.6</ref> Around the same time, other unions such as the [[Singapore Industrial Labour Organisation]] and [[Pioneer Industries Employees Union]] also set up co-operatives to run supermarkets. The two organisations later merged in the early 1980s to form the [[Singapore Employees Co-operative]] (SEC).\n\nIn May 1983, due to competition, NTUC Welcome and SEC merged to form a larger co-operative which was known as NTUC FairPrice Co-Operative Limited.\n\nThe company started a central-distribution system to change the way goods were delivered to stores, to enhance efficiency. This was owned by another company, but in 1998, FairPrice took full ownership of the [[warehouse]] and distribution company. It was renamed Grocery Logistics of Singapore (GLS). On 21 January 2003, FairPrice opened a new 13,000-square-metre Fresh Food Distribution Centre. The [[refrigerator|refrigerated]]-distribution facility centralises the distributions of fresh and chilled products to all the outlets in the chain. It is the first supermarket retailer in Singapore to build, own and operate its own fresh-food distribution centre.<ref>{{cite web |title=Official Opening of NTUC FairPrice's Fresh Food Distribution Centre |url=http://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/speeches/view-html?filename=2003012103.htm |publisher=NAS |accessdate=31 July 2019 |date=21 January 2003}}</ref>[[Image:Esso Singapore.JPG|thumb|right|250px|An [[Esso]] petrol station run by NTUC FairPrice.

The station will be run by NTUC FairPrice Co-operative, which sets the fuel prices and run the station's [[superette|minimart]]. ExxonMobil will supply the fuel, and will sell its oil products inside the FairPrice-run stations. If this pilot project proves successful, all stations will be converted to either FairPrice Xpress or Cheers with the co-operative taking over the management of each station.

Then prime minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] opened the first supermarket at Block 192, Toa Payoh Lorong 4, and it was the first of its kind.<ref>Shapudin, Naqiyah 2013 'Back at the first store after 35 years', The New Paper 27 July. p.6</ref> Around the same time, other unions such as the [[Singapore Industrial Labour Organisation]] and [[Pioneer Industries Employees Union]] also set up co-operatives to run supermarkets. The two organisations later merged in the early 1980s to form the [[Singapore Employees Co-operative]] (SEC).\n\nIn May 1983, due to competition, NTUC Welcome and SEC merged to form a larger co-operative which was known as NTUC FairPrice Co-Operative Limited.\n\nThe company started a central-distribution system to change the way goods were delivered to stores, to enhance efficiency. This was owned by another company, but in 1998, FairPrice took full ownership of the [[warehouse]] and distribution company. It was renamed Grocery Logistics of Singapore (GLS). On 21 January 2003, FairPrice opened a new 13,000-square-metre Fresh Food Distribution Centre. The [[refrigerator|refrigerated]]-distribution facility centralises the distributions of fresh and chilled products to all the outlets in the chain. It is the first supermarket retailer in Singapore to build, own and operate its own fresh-food distribution centre.<ref>{{cite web |title=Official Opening of NTUC FairPrice's Fresh Food Distribution Centre |url=http://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/speeches/view-html?filename=2003012103.htm |publisher=NAS |accessdate=31 July 2019 |date=21 January 2003}}</ref>[[Image:Esso Singapore.JPG|thumb|right|250px|An [[Esso]] petrol station run by NTUC FairPrice.

In summer months, the building was used for various events, including musical performances and horticultural shows. It was the first building in Canada to be electrified.\n\nThe rink hosted the first-ever recorded organized indoor [[ice hockey]] match on March 3, 1875.<ref name=\"mckinley-7\">McKinley, p. 7</ref> The ice surface dimensions set the standard for today's North American ice hockey rinks.<ref name=\"mckinley-7\"/> It was also the location of the first [[Stanley Cup]] [[playoff]] games in 1894 and the location of the founding of the first championship ice hockey league, the [[Amateur Hockey Association of Canada]] in 1886. [[Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby|Frederick Stanley]], the donor of the Stanley Cup, witnessed his first ice hockey game there in 1889. In 1896, telegraph wires were connected at the Rink to do simultaneous score-by-score description of a Stanley Cup challenge series between Montreal and [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]] teams, a first of its kind.\n\nThe rink was also notable for its role in the development of [[figure skating]] in Canada. It held some of the first competitions in the sport in Canada. During its existence, it was the home of two important clubs, the Victoria Skating Club and the Earl Grey Skating Club. It was the home rink of [[Louis Rubenstein]], considered one of the first world champions of the sport, and also an important organizer.\n\nThe rink was located in central Montreal between [[Drummond Street, Montreal|Drummond Street]] and [[Stanley Street, Montreal|Stanley Street]], immediately north of Dorchester Boulevard (presently [[Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque Boulevard]]). It was located one block to the west of Dominion Square (today's [[Dorchester Square]]), where the [[Montreal Winter Carnivals]] of the 19th century were held. Surpassed by other facilities, including the [[Montreal Forum]], the rink was sold in 1925 and today the site is occupied by a parking garage.\n\n==Building==\n\nDesigned by Lawford & Nelson, Architects, the building was a long ({{convert|252|ft|m}} x {{convert|113|ft|m}}) wide, two-story brick edifice with a {{convert|52|ft|m}}-high pitched roof supported from within by curving wooden trusses, which arched over the entire width of the structure.

The area is referred to today as the \"[[Golden Square Mile]],\" the area of central Montreal populated then by rich businessmen of British descent who had made the city the budding centre of commerce in Canada.<ref>Mackay, p. 7</ref> One block east was Dominion Square, where annual outdoor winter sporting events were held and later the Montreal Winter Carnival was held.

In 1886, visiting Captain [[Willard Glazier]] described the scene:\n\n<blockquote>One of the principal points of attraction in both winter and summer is the Victoria Skating Rink, in Dominion Square. This extensive building is used during the milder months of the year for horticultural shows, concerts and miscellaneous gatherings. In the winter the doors of this place are thronged with a crowd of sleighs and sleigh drivers, while inside, skaters and spectators form a living, moving panorama, pleasant to look upon. The place is lighted by gas, and men and women, old and young, with a plentiful sprinkling of children, on skates, are practicing all sorts of gyrations. The ladies are prettily and appropriately dressed in skating costumes, and some of them are proficient in the art of skating. The spectators sit or stand on a raised lege around the ice parallelogram, while the skaters dart off, singly or in pairs, executing quadrilles, waltzes, curves, straight lines, letters, labyrinths, and every conceivable figure. Now and then some one comes to grief in the surging, moving throng; but is quickly on his or her feet again, the ice and water shaken off, and the zigzag resumed. Children skate; boys and girls; ladies and gentlemen, and even dignified military officers. Some skate well, some medium, some shockingly ill; but all skate, or essay to do so. It is the grand Montrealese pastime, and though the ice is sloppy, and the air chill and heavy with moisture, everybody has a good time.<ref>Glazier, p. 245.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Rink hosted pleasure skating and masquerade balls during the 1880s Montreal Winter Carnivals, which took place a city block to the east in Dominion Square.\n\n===Ice hockey===\n\n====First game====\n{{main|First indoor ice hockey game}}\nOn March 3, 1875, the Rink hosted what has been recognized as the first indoor organized ice hockey game, between members of the Club, organized by [[James George Aylwin Creighton|James Creighton]], a member of the Victoria Skating Club and a figure skating judge.<ref name=\"vic-dedication\">{{cite news|work=Toronto Star |date=May 23, 2008 |page=S3 |title='Father' of ice hockey honoured}}</ref> The match lays claim to this distinction because of several factors which establish its link to modern ice hockey: it featured two teams (nine players per side), goaltenders, a referee, a puck, a pre-determined set of rules, including a pre-determined length of time (60 minutes) with a recorded score. Games prior to this had mostly been outdoors, with sticks and balls, with informal rules and informal team sizes. In order to limit injuries to spectators and damage to glass windows, the game was played with a wooden [[puck (sports)|puck]] instead of a [[lacrosse]] ball, possibly the first time such an object was used. The two teams, members of the Club, included a number of McGill University students.

Good fun may be expected, as some of the players are reputed to be exceedingly expert at the game. Some fears have been expressed on the part of intending spectators that accidents were likely to occur through the ball flying about in too lively a manner, to the imminent danger of lookers on, but we understand that the game will be played with a flat circular piece of wood, thus preventing all danger of its leaving the surface of the ice. Subscribers will be admitted on presentation of their tickets.<ref>{{cite news |work=Montreal Gazette |title=Victoria Rink |date=March 3, 1875 |page=3}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBy moving ice hockey game indoors, the smaller dimensions of the rink initiated a major change from the outdoor version of the game, limiting organized contests to a nine-man limit per team. Until that time, outdoor games had no prescribed number of players, the number being more or less the number that could fit on a frozen pond or river and often ranged in the dozens.<ref name=\"mckinley-7\"/> The nine-man per side rule would last until the 1880s, when it was reduced during the Montreal Winter Carnival Hockey Tournament to seven per side.\n\n====Role in organized ice hockey====\nFrom 1875 until 1881, hockey matches would be held between hockey-playing members of the Skating Club and outside teams, such as McGill University and the [[Montreal Hockey Club]]. In 1881, the [[Montreal Victorias|Victoria Hockey Club]] was organized and made the Rink its home. Play at first was by exhibition only as there were no leagues. The Rink was used for exhibition games or as an indoor facility if the outdoor rink was not available during the annual Winter Carnivals. It was for the 1883 Carnival that hockey team sizes were reduced further, to seven per side, which was the common size for the next thirty years.{{sfn|Collard|1962|p=167}} Eventually the tournament play led to plans for a league. The Rink hosted the founding meeting of the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada (AHAC) league in December 1886. The AHAC was the second organized ice hockey league in Canada, and the first championship league.\n\n[[Lord Stanley]], later to donate the [[Stanley Cup]] trophy, witnessed his first ice hockey game at the Victoria Rink on February 4, 1889, seeing the Victorias defeat the [[Montreal Hockey Club]] 2\u20131.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hhof.com/html/exSCJ07_01.shtml |title=Hockey Hall of Fame: Stanley Cup Journals 01 |accessdate=May 13, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525203043/http://www.hhof.com/html/exSCJ07_01.shtml |archive-date=May 25, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> According to ''The Globe'', \"the vice-regal party was immensely delighted with it.\"<ref>{{cite news|work=The Globe |date=February 5, 1889 |page=1 |title=News from Montreal}}</ref> The Rink would later host the [[1894 Stanley Cup Playoffs|first Stanley Cup playoffs]] in 1894.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.collectionscanada.ca/hockey/024002-119.01-e.php?&hockey_id_nbr=8&&PHPSESSID=rq9jcm5ucr4uim576lt6808ik4 |title=Game summary at Backcheck web site |access-date=September 19, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323090826/http://www.collectionscanada.ca/hockey/024002-119.01-e.php |archive-date=March 23, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> By that time, the building had gained an elevated balcony for additional spectators and a projecting loge, precursor of today's luxury boxes.

In 1896, telegraph wires were connected at the Rink to do simultaneous score-by-score description of a Stanley Cup challenge series between Montreal and [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]] teams, a first of its kind. \n\nThe rink was also notable for its role in the development of [[figure skating]] in Canada. It held some of the first competitions in the sport in Canada. During its existence, it was the home of two important clubs, the Victoria Skating Club and the Earl Grey Skating Club. It was the home rink of [[Louis Rubenstein]], considered one of the first world champions of the sport, and also an important organizer.\n\nThe rink was located in central Montreal between [[Drummond Street, Montreal|Drummond Street]] and [[Stanley Street, Montreal|Stanley Street]], immediately north of Dorchester Boulevard (presently [[Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque Boulevard]]). It was located one block to the west of Dominion Square (today's [[Dorchester Square]]), where the [[Montreal Winter Carnivals]] of the 19th century were held.

In 1886, visiting Captain [[Willard Glazier]] described the scene:\n\n<blockquote>One of the principal points of attraction in both winter and summer is the Victoria Skating Rink, in Dominion Square. This extensive building is used during the milder months of the year for horticultural shows, concerts and miscellaneous gatherings. In the winter the doors of this place are thronged with a crowd of sleighs and sleigh drivers, while inside, skaters and spectators form a living, moving panorama, pleasant to look upon. The place is lighted by gas, and men and women, old and young, with a plentiful sprinkling of children, on skates, are practicing all sorts of gyrations. The ladies are prettily and appropriately dressed in skating costumes, and some of them are proficient in the art of skating. The spectators sit or stand on a raised lege around the ice parallelogram, while the skaters dart off, singly or in pairs, executing quadrilles, waltzes, curves, straight lines, letters, labyrinths, and every conceivable figure. Now and then some one comes to grief in the surging, moving throng; but is quickly on his or her feet again, the ice and water shaken off, and the zigzag resumed. Children skate; boys and girls; ladies and gentlemen, and even dignified military officers. Some skate well, some medium, some shockingly ill; but all skate, or essay to do so. It is the grand Montrealese pastime, and though the ice is sloppy, and the air chill and heavy with moisture, everybody has a good time.<ref>Glazier, p. 245.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Rink hosted pleasure skating and masquerade balls during the 1880s Montreal Winter Carnivals, which took place a city block to the east in Dominion Square.\n\n===Ice hockey===\n\n====First game====\n{{main|First indoor ice hockey game}}\nOn March 3, 1875, the Rink hosted what has been recognized as the first indoor organized ice hockey game, between members of the Club, organized by [[James George Aylwin Creighton|James Creighton]], a member of the Victoria Skating Club and a figure skating judge.<ref name=\"vic-dedication\">{{cite news|work=Toronto Star |date=May 23, 2008 |page=S3 |title='Father' of ice hockey honoured}}</ref> The match lays claim to this distinction because of several factors which establish its link to modern ice hockey: it featured two teams (nine players per side), goaltenders, a referee, a puck, a pre-determined set of rules, including a pre-determined length of time (60 minutes) with a recorded score. Games prior to this had mostly been outdoors, with sticks and balls, with informal rules and informal team sizes. In order to limit injuries to spectators and damage to glass windows, the game was played with a wooden [[puck (sports)|puck]] instead of a [[lacrosse]] ball, possibly the first time such an object was used. The two teams, members of the Club, included a number of McGill University students. Sticks and skates for this game were imported from Nova Scotia, including Mic-mac sticks and Starr skates.<ref>McKinley, p. 9</ref> This first game was pre-announced to the general public in the pages of the ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'' newspaper:\n\n[[File:Victoria-rink-1893.jpg|thumb|alt=A group of hockey players are positioned on the ice inside the arena.

Some fears have been expressed on the part of intending spectators that accidents were likely to occur through the ball flying about in too lively a manner, to the imminent danger of lookers on, but we understand that the game will be played with a flat circular piece of wood, thus preventing all danger of its leaving the surface of the ice. Subscribers will be admitted on presentation of their tickets.<ref>{{cite news |work=Montreal Gazette |title=Victoria Rink |date=March 3, 1875 |page=3}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBy moving ice hockey game indoors, the smaller dimensions of the rink initiated a major change from the outdoor version of the game, limiting organized contests to a nine-man limit per team. Until that time, outdoor games had no prescribed number of players, the number being more or less the number that could fit on a frozen pond or river and often ranged in the dozens.<ref name=\"mckinley-7\"/> The nine-man per side rule would last until the 1880s, when it was reduced during the Montreal Winter Carnival Hockey Tournament to seven per side.\n\n====Role in organized ice hockey====\nFrom 1875 until 1881, hockey matches would be held between hockey-playing members of the Skating Club and outside teams, such as McGill University and the [[Montreal Hockey Club]]. In 1881, the [[Montreal Victorias|Victoria Hockey Club]] was organized and made the Rink its home. Play at first was by exhibition only as there were no leagues. The Rink was used for exhibition games or as an indoor facility if the outdoor rink was not available during the annual Winter Carnivals. It was for the 1883 Carnival that hockey team sizes were reduced further, to seven per side, which was the common size for the next thirty years.{{sfn|Collard,|1962|p=167}} Eventually the tournament play led to plans for a league. The Rink hosted the founding meeting of the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada (AHAC) league in December 1886. The AHAC was the second organized ice hockey league in Canada, and the first championship league. \n\n[[Lord Stanley]], later to donate the [[Stanley Cup]] trophy, witnessed his first ice hockey game at the Victoria Rink on February 4, 1889, seeing the Victorias defeat the [[Montreal Hockey Club]] 2\u20131.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hhof.com/html/exSCJ07_01.shtml |title=Hockey Hall of Fame: Stanley Cup Journals 01 |accessdate=May 13, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525203043/http://www.hhof.com/html/exSCJ07_01.shtml |archive-date=May 25, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> According to ''The Globe'', \"the vice-regal party was immensely delighted with it.\"<ref>{{cite news|work=The Globe |date=February 5, 1889 |page=1 |title=News from Montreal}}</ref> The Rink would later host the [[1894 Stanley Cup Playoffs|first Stanley Cup playoffs]] in 1894.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.collectionscanada.ca/hockey/024002-119.01-e.php?&hockey_id_nbr=8&&PHPSESSID=rq9jcm5ucr4uim576lt6808ik4 |title=Game summary at Backcheck web site |access-date=September 19, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323090826/http://www.collectionscanada.ca/hockey/024002-119.01-e.php |archive-date=March 23, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> By that time, the building had gained an elevated balcony for additional spectators and a projecting loge, precursor of today's luxury boxes.

A combination of racing and fancy skating championships was held in February 1888 was announced internationally in the February 1, 1888 ''[[New York Times]].''

By then it had about {{convert|75|km}} of double track (103.2 route km or 64.12 route miles) and 1,200 cars and trailers, on 15 routes radiating from the centre of Melbourne to neighbouring suburbs. It was one of the largest cable car systems in the world, comparable with those of [[San Francisco cable car system|San Francisco]] which had 23 lines, and [[Chicago City Railway|Chicago]] which had 66.0&nbsp;km of double track.<ref name=\"Trams of Australia\">{{Citation | url=http://www.railpage.org.au/tram/cable.html | work=David Hoadley | title=Melbourne's cable trams | accessdate=2011-10-17 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121202914/http://www.railpage.org.au/tram/cable.html | archive-date=21 November 2011 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nWith the exception of the Northcote tramway, which was privately built and managed,<ref name=\"Northcote\">{{Citation| url=http://www.hawthorntramdepot.org.au/papers/northcote.htm | work=Friends of Hawthorn Tram Depot | title=Northcote: the on again, off again cable tramway | accessdate=2011-10-03}}</ref> the infrastructure of the network was built by the Melbourne Tramway Trust, which consisted of representatives of the 12 local councils served by the system. The trust bought land, laid the tracks, and built the cable winding houses. The [[Melbourne Tramway & Omnibus Company]] (MTOC) provided the trams and operated the services from 1885 to 1916<ref name=\"cableguy\"/> under an exclusive 30-year franchise arrangement with the Victorian Government. MTOC had been founded by Francis Boardman Clapp, an [[United States|American]] emigrant, who had purchased the Victorian rights to the patents of the cable system developed by [[Andrew Smith Hallidie|Andrew Hallidie]]. [[George Smith Duncan]], who had built the [[Dunedin cable tramway system|Roslyn cable tramway]] in [[Dunedin]], New Zealand, was the engineer in charge of the development of the Melbourne cable network.<ref name=\"cableguy\">{{Citation| url=http://www.cable-car-guy.com/html/ccoznz.html | work=Joe Thompson | title=Cable Tramways in Australia and New Zealand | accessdate=2011-10-17}}</ref>\n\nOn the expiration of the MTOC's franchise in 1916, the cable tram network was transferred to the Victorian Government, and then passed to the government-owned [[Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board]] (MMTB) on 1 November 1919. The Northcote tramway was transferred to the MMTB on 20 February 1920.<ref name=\"Northcote\"/>\n\nAlthough the first electric tram service was introduced in 1889, and ran for seven years between the outer Melbourne suburbs of [[Box Hill, Victoria|Box Hill]] and [[Doncaster, Victoria|Doncaster]], the electric tram network did not seriously commence until 1906, when the [[Victorian Railways]] built an \"Electric Street Railway\" from [[St Kilda railway station]] to [[Brighton, Victoria|Brighton]], and [[List of defunct utility companies in Victoria, Australia#The North Melbourne Electric Tramways and Lighting Company|The North Melbourne Electric Tramway & Lighting Company]] built an electric tramway towards [[Essendon, Victoria|Essendon]] from the terminus of the cable system.<ref>{{Citation| url=http://www.yarratrams.com.au/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-64/42_read-107/ | work=[[Yarra Trams]] | title=The First Electric Trams | accessdate=2011-10-17}}</ref> From 1924 the cable tram lines were progressively converted to electric traction.

The line was converted to electric traction in stages. The line was at first truncated to Swanston Street on 15 May 1927, the rest of the line closing on 29 June 1927. The converted line between Swanston Street and Spencer Street opened on 14 July 1927. The section between Swanston Street and Simpson Street opened on 17 September 1927, and the rest of the line to Hawthorn Bridge opened later that year on 4 December, connecting with the Church Street line and the Burwood Road line, which were already in operation. This conversion enabled Mont Albert and East Kew trams to reach the city directly. The powerhouse was located on Bridge Road, at [[Hoddle Highway#Hoddle Street|Hoddle Street]], and has since been demolished to provide for a left-turn lane. The remains of the Richmond cable tram depot now form part of the Amora Hotel, near Hawthorn Bridge.\n\n=== North Fitzroy Line (1886-1930) ===\nThe North Fitzroy line opened on 2 October 1886, and ran between North Fitzroy and City (Collins Street). The line was converted to electric traction in stages. The North Fitzroy Line was truncated to Brunswick Street on 14 September 1929. The line was eventually fully closed on 12 July 1930. The Collins Street section was converted to electric traction and opened on 8 December 1929. The line between Brunswick Street and North Fitzroy was reopened on 26 October 1930. This conversion enabled a direct route for West Preston and East Preston electric trams to reach the city, rather than using the Holden Street line. The powerhouse was located on the north-east corner of [[Victoria Street, Melbourne|Victoria Parade]] and [[Brunswick Street, Melbourne|Brunswick Street]].<ref name=\"cableguy2\">{{Citation|title=Cable Tramways in Australia and New Zealand|url=http://www.cable-car-guy.com/html/ccoznz.html|work=Joe Thompson|accessdate=2011-10-17}}</ref><ref name=\"VHD_7822-09842\">{{Cite VHD|56007|Former Brunswick Street cable tram engine house|hi=7822-0984|accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref> The car shed was located at Holden Street near the North Fitzroy terminus.\n[[File:Tramcar_Melbourne_QE1_47.jpg|thumb|A cable tram at the Victoria Bridge terminus]]\n\n=== Victoria Bridge Line (1886-1929) ===\nThe Victoria Bridge line opened on 22 November 1886, and ran between Victoria Bridge and City (Collins Street). The Victoria Bridge line was closed on 13 July 1929 for conversion to electric traction between Victoria Bridge and Brunswick Street. This section reopened on 15 September 1929, providing a second route for East Kew and Mont Albert electric trams to reach the city (along with Bridge Road). The rest of the Collins Street line was converted to electric traction and reopened on 8 December 1929. The powerhouse was located on the north-east corner of Victoria Parade and Brunswick Street.<ref name=\"cableguy2\" /><ref name=\"VHD_7822-09842\" /> The car shed was located on Victoria Street near the Victoria Bridge terminus.\n\n=== Clifton Hill Line (1887-1940) ===\nThe Clifton Hill line opened on 10 August 1887, and ran between Clifton Hill and City (Bourke Street). When the Clifton Hill - Northcote line opened in 1890, it interchanged with the Clifton Hill line at its southern terminus. Passengers initially had to physically walk between the two lines for a through service. When the Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board took over the line in 1925, the two lines were connected together and a through-service was established between Northcote and the City (Bourke Street). The combined Clifton Hill/Northcote line was among the last cable lines to close (along with the Nicholson Street line) on 26 October 1940. Initially, the MMTB replaced the line with buses. Within a few years, it was noticed that the bus route were unsuccessful at coping with the high demand of the routes, so conversion of the Northcote line to electric traction was scheduled to take place right after World War II ended. However, it was not until 26 September 1955 that the Northcote/Clifton Hill route finally reopened. The powerhouse was located on the south-east corner of [[Nicholson Street|Nicholson]] and [[Gertrude Street]]s.<ref name=\"cableguy2\" /><ref name=\"VHD_H05842\">{{Cite VHD|456|Former Nicholson Street cable tram engine house|hr=0584|ho=181|accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref> The car shed was located on Queens Parade near the Clifton Hill terminus.\n\n=== Nicholson Street Line (1887-1940) ===\nThe Nicholson Street line opened on 30 August 1887, and ran between Nicholson Street and City (Bourke Street).

The powerhouse located on the south-east corner of Nicholson and Gertrude Streets.<ref name=\"cableguy2\" /><ref name=\"VHD_H05842\" /> The car shed was located on Nicholson Street near the Nicholson Street terminus.\n\n=== Brunswick Line (1887-1936) ===\n[[File:Brunswick cable tram.jpg|thumb|right|270px|The Brunswick Line, circa 1930s.]]\nThe Brunswick line opened on 1 October 1887, and ran between Brunswick and City (Elizabeth Street). The Brunswick line was converted to electric traction in stages. The line was first truncated to Victoria Street on 29 September 1935. It was further truncated to Leonard Street, Parkville on 17 November 1935. The Brunswick Line was finally closed on 11 January 1936. The powerhouse was located on the north-west corner of Brunswick Road and Black Street.<ref name=\"cableguy2\" /> The car shed was located near the Moreland Road terminus.\n\n=== Collingwood Line (1887-1939) ===\nThe Collingwood line opened on 21 December 1887, and initially ran between Collingwood and City (Lonsdale Street). When the Prahran line opened in 1888, the Collingwood line operated through-routed services to Prahran. When the Swanston Street line was truncated back to Princes Bridge on 26 December 1925 for electrification, the Collingwood and North Carlton lines were truncated back to Lonsdale Street. The line was finally closed on 15 April 1939, being converted into a bus service. The powerhouse was located on the north side of Johnston Street, near Brunswick Street.<ref name=\"cableguy2\" /> The car shed was located near the Johnston Street Bridge terminus.\n\n=== Brighton Road Line (1888-1925) ===\nThe Brighton Road line opened on 11 October 1888, and originally ran between Brighton Road and City (Swanston Street). The initial city terminus was at Flinders Street, but this was extended northwards towards Queensberry Street on 20 January 1889. The trams operated along Brighton Road, High Street (now just St Kilda Road), St Kilda Road and Swanston Street from Brunning Street, Balaclava to Queensberry Street, Carlton. The line was truncated from Queensberry Street to Lonsdale Street on 11 February 1924 to allow the electric trams from the North to terminate in the City. Following this point, Brighton Road trams were through-routed to North Melbourne via Lonsdale Street. The Brighton Road tram line fully closed for electrification on 26 December 1925, but the section between City Road and Domain Road remained for Toorak and Prahran trams to use. An electrified line from Lonsdale Street to Brighton Road was completed on 29 August 1926. Both the powerhouse and car shed were located on the south-east corner of [[St Kilda Road]] and Bromby Street.<ref name=\"cableguy2\" />\n\n=== Prahran Line (1888-1926) ===\nThe Prahran line opened on 26 October 1888, and ran between Prahran and City (Swanston Street). All Prahran line trams were through-routed to Collingwood via Lonsdale Street. The line ran along Chapel Street from Carlisle Street and Toorak Road where it met the Toorak line, along Toorak Road, Park Street and Domain Road to St Kilda Road where it met the Brighton Road line. Trams then ran via St Kilda Road and Swanston Street to Lonsdale Street where trams continued onto Collingwood. The line was truncated to City Road on 26 December 1925, when the Swanston Street line was closed for electrification. The line was further truncated back to Domain Road on 12 January 1926, when the St Kilda Road line was being converted to electric traction. The rest of the line was closed on 28 August 1926. However, Toorak trams still used the line between Domain Road and Chapel Street until October 1 later that year. The powerhouse and the car shed were both located on the north-west corner of Toorak Road and [[Chapel Street]].<ref name=\"cableguy2\" />\n\n=== North Carlton Line (1889-1939) ===\nThe North Carlton line opened on 9 February 1889, and ran between North Carlton and City (Lonsdale Street). In 1897, the North Carlton service began running through-routed services to St Kilda Beach. The line was closed in 1 August 1936, being replaced by a bus service, though the Collingwood line continued to use the section of track between Rathdowne Street and Lonsdale Street until it closed on 15 April 1939. Both the powerhouse and the car shed were located at the south-west corner of Rathdowne and Park Streets.<ref name=\"cableguy2\" /><ref>{{Cite VHD|245|Former North Carlton cable tram engine house|hr=0718|ho=120|accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref>\n\n=== Toorak Line (1889-1926) ===\nThe Toorak line opened on 15 February 1889, and ran between Toorak and City (Swanston Street). The initial city terminus was at Flinders Street, but this was extended northwards towards Queensberry Street on 20 January 1889. The line was truncated from Queensberry Street to Lonsdale Street on 11 February 1924 to allow the electric trams from the North to terminate in the City. The line was truncated to City Road on 26 December 1925, when the Swanston Street line was closed for electrification. The line was further truncated back to Domain Road on 12 January 1926, when the St Kilda Road line was being converted to electric traction. The rest of the line was finally closed on 1 October 1926. Both the car shed and the powerhouse located on the north-west corner of Toorak Road and Chapel Street.<ref name=\"cableguy2\" />\n\n=== North Melbourne Line (1890-1935) ===\nThe North Melbourne Line opened on 3 March 1890, and ran between Flemington Bridge and City (Elizabeth Street). Trams initially terminated at Flinders Street, but due to congestion, the line was diverted at Lonsdale Street and through-routed to Brighton Road on 11 February 1924. The section between Flemington Bridge and Abbotsford Street was closed for electric conversion on 18 July 1925, which was first section cable line in Melbourne to close. The rest of the line closed for conversion to electric traction on 20 July 1935, though the Brunswick Line continued to use the Elizabeth Street section until 28 September 1935. The powerhouse was located on the west corner of Queensberry and Abbotsford Streets.<ref name=\"cableguy2\" /><ref>{{Cite VHD|4638|Former cable tram engine house and cable tram track formation|hr=0988|ho=283|accessdate=2011-12-10}}</ref> The car shed was located was located near the Flemington Bridge terminus, but later was moved to Victoria Street, near the intersection of Howard Street after the Flemington Bridge section of the line was closed.\n\n=== West Melbourne Line (1890-1935) ===\nThe West Melbourne line opened on 18 April 1890, and ran between West Melbourne and City (Elizabeth Street).

The trust bought land, laid the tracks, and built the cable winding houses. The [[Melbourne Tramway & Omnibus Company]] (MTOC) provided the trams and operated the services from 1885 to 1916<ref name=\"cableguy\"/> under an exclusive 30-year franchise arrangement with the Victorian Government. MTOC had been founded by Francis Boardman Clapp, an [[United States|American]] emigrant, who had purchased the Victorian rights to the patents of the cable system developed by [[Andrew Smith Hallidie|Andrew Hallidie]]. [[George Smith Duncan]], who had built the [[Dunedin cable tramway system|Roslyn cable tramway]] in [[Dunedin]], New Zealand, was the engineer in charge of the development of the Melbourne cable network.<ref name=\"cableguy\">{{Citation| url=http://www.cable-car-guy.com/html/ccoznz.html | work=Joe Thompson | title=Cable Tramways in Australia and New Zealand | accessdate=2011-10-17}}</ref>\n\nOn the expiration of the MTOC's franchise in 1916, the cable tram network was transferred to the Victorian Government, and then passed to the government-owned [[Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board]] (MMTB) on 1 November 1919.

The line was converted to electric traction in stages. The line was at first truncated to Swanston Street on 15 May 1927, the rest of the line closing on 29 June 1927. The converted line between Swanston Street and Spencer Street opened on 14 July 1927. The section between Swanston Street and Simpson Street opened on 17 September 1927, and the rest of the line to Hawthorn Bridge opened later that year on 4 December, connecting with the Church Street line and the Burwood Road line, which were already in operation. This conversion enabled Mont Albert and East Kew trams to reach the city directly. The powerhouse was located on Bridge Road, at [[Hoddle Highway#Hoddle Street|Hoddle Street]], and has since been demolished to provide for a left-turn lane. The remains of the Richmond cable tram depot now form part of the Amora Hotel, near Hawthorn Bridge.\n\n=== North Fitzroy Line (1886-1930) ===\nThe North Fitzroy line opened on 2 October 1886, and ran between North Fitzroy and City (Collins Street). The line was converted to electric traction in stages. The North Fitzroy Line was truncated to Brunswick Street on 14 September 1929. The line was eventually fully closed on 12 July 1930. The Collins Street section was converted to electric traction and opened on 8 December 1929. The line between Brunswick Street and North Fitzroy was reopened on 26 October 1930. This conversion enabled a direct route for West Preston and East Preston electric trams to reach the city, rather than using the Holden Street line.

When the Clifton Hill - Northcote line opened in 1890, it interchanged with the Clifton Hill line at its southern terminus. Passengers initially had to physically walk between the two lines for a through service. When the Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board took over the line in 1925, the two lines were connected together and a through-service was established between Northcote and the City (Bourke Street). The combined Clifton Hill/Northcote line was among the last cable lines to close (along with the Nicholson Street line) on 26 October 1940. Initially, the MMTB replaced the line with buses.

The powerhouse was located on the north-west corner of Brunswick Road and Black Street.<ref name=\"cableguy2\" /> The car shed was located near the Moreland Road terminus.\n\n=== Collingwood Line (1887-1939) ===\nThe Collingwood line opened on 21 December 1887, and initially ran between Collingwood and City (Lonsdale Street). When the Prahran line opened in 1888, the Collingwood line operated through-routed services to Prahran. When the Swanston Street line was truncated back to Princes Bridge on 26 December 1925 for electrification, the Collingwood and North Carlton lines were truncated back to Lonsdale Street. The line was finally closed on 15 April 1939, being converted into a bus service. The powerhouse was located on the north side of Johnston Street, near Brunswick Street.<ref name=\"cableguy2\" /> The car shed was located near the Johnston Street Bridge terminus.\n\n=== Brighton Road Line (1888-1925) ===\nThe Brighton Road line opened on 11 October 1888, and originally ran between Brighton Road and City (Swanston Street). The initial city terminus was at Flinders Street, but this was extended northwards towards Queensberry Street on 20 January 1889. The trams operated along Brighton Road, High Street (now just St Kilda Road), St Kilda Road and Swanston Street from Brunning Street, Balaclava to Queensberry Street, Carlton. The line was truncated from Queensberry Street to Lonsdale Street on 11 February 1924 to allow the electric trams from the North to terminate in the City. Following this point, Brighton Road trams were through-routed to North Melbourne via Lonsdale Street. The Brighton Road tram line fully closed for electrification on 26 December 1925, but the section between City Road and Domain Road remained for Toorak and Prahran trams to use. An electrified line from Lonsdale Street to Brighton Road was completed on 29 August 1926.

All Prahran line trams were through-routed to Collingwood via Lonsdale Street. The line ran along Chapel Street from Carlisle Street and Toorak Road where it met the Toorak line, along Toorak Road, Park Street and Domain Road to St Kilda Road where it met the Brighton Road line. Trams then ran via St Kilda Road and Swanston Street to Lonsdale Street where trams continued onto Collingwood. The line was truncated to City Road on 26 December 1925, when the Swanston Street line was closed for electrification. The line was further truncated back to Domain Road on 12 January 1926, when the St Kilda Road line was being converted to electric traction. The rest of the line was closed on 28 August 1926.
