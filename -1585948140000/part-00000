He gets on well with the family; however, with Agnes, this is a different matter altogether. The two have a deep rivalry, and are sometimes quite horrible to each other, examples of which include: Agnes forcing Grandad to sing a Western song and hitting him with a tray, Grandad trapping Agnes behind the Christmas tree, Agnes trying to get rid of Grandad for two weeks and Grandad referring to her as \"The Twat\".\n\nDespite their animosity to each other, Agnes and Grandad have been shown to genuinely care for each other, even if they conceal it very well. On Valentine's Day, Grandad gave flowers to Agnes and admitted that he thought his son was foolish for taking Agnes for granted. On another occasion, when Grandad was to go to the hospital for tests, Grandad admitted to Agnes that he was afraid, prompting Agnes to give him a pep talk to boost his spirits.\n\nWhen the Brown children were growing up, Grandad played a small role in their lives. He would take them on a walk to the betting shop where he would spend the day. He still looks out for the children, but not as much. Bono enjoys playing (or in his view, tormenting) with him. Grandad has long white hair and is most often found in his armchair, sleeping. In [[World War Two]], he was part of the bomb squad. His wife's name has not been mentioned.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Mark Brown===\n\n{{Infobox soap character \n|series = [[Mrs. Brown's Boys]]\n|name= Mark Brown\n|portrayer=Pat 'Pepsi' Shields \n|introducer=[[Brendan O'Carroll]]\n|years= 2011\u2013\n|first= 28 February 2011\n|classification = Present; regular\n|born=circa 1964\n|occupation = Carpenter\n|father = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Redser Brown|Redser Brown]]\n|mother = [[Agnes Brown]]\n|brothers = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Dermot Brown|Dermot Brown]]<br>[[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Rory Brown|Rory Brown]]<br>[[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Trevor Brown|Trevor Brown]]<br>[[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Frankie Brown|Frankie Brown]] <small>(debatable)</small><br>[[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Simon Brown|Simon Brown]] <small>(debatable)</small>\n|sisters = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Cathy Brown|Cathy Brown]]\n|wife = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Betty Brown|Betty Brown]] (2004\u2013)\n|sons = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Bono Brown|Bono Brown]]\n|aunts = Dolly\n|uncles = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Terry Brown|Terry Brown]]\n|nephews = John Brown<br>George Brown<br>Ringo Brown\n|grandfathers = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Grandad|Harold Brown]]\n}}\n\n'''Mark Brown''' is the eldest Brown child, husband to Betty and father to Bono.\n\nMark became head of the family aged twenty-six, when his father suddenly died. He is the quietest too, often coaxed into things by his wife. He was born on his parents' wedding day; Agnes's waters broke just after the couple said 'I do'. He was offered a promotion at work, but turned it down. The subsequent result was that Betty kicked him out and he turned up at his mother's house, depressed and tired. He turned down the job because, despite attending school for eight years and not missing a single day, he did not learn to read or write. Agnes, feeling guilty, blamed herself until Cathy pointed out that if in eight years he failed to learn, it was the teachers fault. The problem is resolved when Betty says that she is determined to teach him.\n\nLater on, there was no work going in the carpenter world, and Mark was made redundant. He and Betty had no other choice than to up sticks to Australia. Mark was reluctant to tell his mother, but Betty forced him to. Although putting on a brave face, it mortified Agnes, who sat silent for the rest of the day. The visas for the three came through, and Agnes found it even harder. However, Betty asked Cathy to print something at work for her. Cathy did so and soon, Mark found himself with more work than he could handle. The sheets that were photocopied turned out to be leaflets, which Betty posted through letterboxes. The family didn't emigrate to Australia, and the couple let their son Bono \u2013 Agnes's favourite relative \u2013 break the good news.\n\nMark and Betty are much more well-off than the other family members.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Rory Brown===\n\n{{Infobox soap character \n|series = [[Mrs. Brown's Boys]]\n|name= Rory Brown\n|portrayer=[[Rory Cowan]] (2011\u20132017)<br>Pat \"Pepsi\" Shields (2017 tour)<br>Damien McKiernan (2017\u2013)\n|introducer=[[Brendan O'Carroll]]\n|years= 2011\u2013\n|first= 21 February 2011\n|classification = Present; regular\n|born=circa 1965\n|occupation = Hairdresser\n|father = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Redser Brown|Redser Brown]]\n|mother = [[Agnes Brown]]\n|husband = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Dino Doyle|Dino Doyle]] (2013\u2013)\n|brothers = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Mark Brown|Mark Brown]]<br>[[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Dermot Brown|Dermot Brown]]<br>[[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Trevor Brown|Trevor Brown]]<br>[[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Frankie Brown|Frankie Brown]] <small>(debatable)</small><br>[[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Simon Brown|Simon Brown]] <small>(debatable)</small>\n|sisters = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Cathy Brown|Cathy Brown]]\n|aunts = Dolly\n|uncles = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Terry Brown|Terry Brown]]\n|nephews = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Bono Brown|Bono Brown]]<br>John Brown<br>George Brown<br>Ringo Brown\n|grandfathers = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Grandad|Harold Brown]]\n}}\n\n'''Rory Brown''' is the third son of the Brown family.\n\nRory Brown is the only homosexual in the family, a fact acknowledged by all of his family members except his mother, who seemed completely oblivious to the fact until she realises this with Cathy's intervention in \"Mammy of the Groom\". Rory is not married, up until the end of Season 3, when he gets married to fellow hairdresser Dino Doyle, in a private ceremony.\n\nHis sexuality is hinted at in \"Mammy's Secret\" when Rory tries to tell Agnes in Foley's; however, he is unable to do so. It is also hinted at later on in that episode when Agnes is having a discussion with Cathy and she says that Rory wants to tell her something, but is afraid that it will hurt her. This is also hinted at even more when the family is discussing who is coming to Dermot and Maria's wedding, when Rory said that he won't be bringing a girl. Rory was also apparently caught wearing his sister's communion dress when he was about 10.\n\nAgnes is the only character not to know about his homosexuality up until \"Mammy of the Groom\" where she describes it as an illness. Until then, she was completely unaware of this and even Agnes' best friend, Winnie McGoogan, knew that Rory was homosexual.\n\nRory is one of two of Agnes's children to wear glasses, the other being Trevor.\n\n[[Rory Cowan]] quit the role in July 2017 after 26 years of playing the character both on screen and in theatre, stating that he had not been happy for two years, although he did not state the reason behind it.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.msn.com/en-gb/entertainment/tv/rory-cowan-leaves-mrs-browns-boys-after-26-years-i-hadnt-been-happy-for-two-years/ar-BBE7wQR?li=AAnZ9Ug&ocid=mailsignout&#93;# |title=Archived copy |access-date=23 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713063647/http://www.msn.com/en-gb/entertainment/tv/rory-cowan-leaves-mrs-browns-boys-after-26-years-i-hadnt-been-happy-for-two-years/ar-BBE7wQR?li=AAnZ9Ug# |archive-date=13 July 2017 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nIt was announced that the character would be replaced and would be revealed on the 2017 Christmas Day special.<ref>http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/film-tv/news/brendan-ocarroll-announces-rory-cowans-mrs-browns-boys-replacement-35930519.html</ref> During the 2017 live tour for the November \u2013 December shows the role was played by other cast member Pat \"Pepsi\" Shields.

It was revealed by Maria Brown that Mick was already married. It was revealed later in the series that Mick divorced his last wife. They then get back together. Cathy claims that he's more sensitive. Later in the series, when Cathy is expecting a surprise romance holiday to Venice, Mick States that he is going to Cork for work. Cathy is automatically suspicious and decides to take a walk by the airport.

He later met and proposed to Maria Nicholson, and the two married. Dermot gained a job as a promoter, a job which involves walking around the streets in various large and embarrassing costumes. Dermot and Maria had triplet sons, named after [[The Beatles]]: John, George and Ringo. Maria was initially against Dermot naming the children (\"Your family doesn't have a great track record with names; you have a nephew named after a dog biscuit!\"), but was soon swayed by his mostly normal names.

He was very nearly not home for one Christmas, much to Agnes's dismay (everyone else knew). However, in the middle of the party, Trevor walks through the door and Agnes bursts into tears, overjoyed. When he leaves for the missions in Series Two, he tells his mother that he doesn't want a big fuss like last time, his exact words being \"no cake, no decorations, no brass band and please, Mammy, ''no tears''\". Agnes disobeys him and orders everything. Another Christmas time, Agnes is reading the letters her children sent to [[Father Christmas]], and reads Trevor's. Trevor asks for his presents to be given to a poor boy with no toys.\n\nTrevor has since appeared sporadically throughout the series.

Betty spends her nights down at Foley's with Cathy, Maria, Agnes, and Winnie. She does not like snakes.\n\nWhen Mark, Betty, and Bono were thinking of moving to Australia, Betty was keener to move than her husband and son. She had already started packing before the visas arrived! However, upon seeing how much it would destroy Agnes if they did move, Betty wrote out some leaflets and asked Cathy to photocopy them at her workplace.

However, he gives in and gets permission from the Bishop once Agnes gets him to make amends with his own mother over the phone. He baptizes the Brown triplets and later visits Agnes, but accidentally causes her to act-up after he accidentally says one of the hypnosis words that turns her into a stripper (as the hypnotist at the baptism party didn't completely remove the hypnosis from her). When Rory and Dino are getting married, he tells Agnes (despite her protests) that he cannot bless them as the Church is against same-sex marriage. But he later shows up at the Brown house to celebrate their marriage as he personally is happy to celebrate all forms of love.\n\nFather Damien also appears in ''All Round to Mrs Brown's'', where he along with Trevor, hosts a segment called \"Thought for the Day\". In a rather marked contrast to his series self, Father Damien is shown here to be rather childish, often providing non-sequiturs and rather humorous lines to the segment, with Trevor serving as the \"straight man\" in the act.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Father Quinn===\n{{Infobox soap character \n|series = [[Mrs. Brown's Boys]]\n|name= Father Quinn\n|portrayer=Gary Lilburn\n|introducer=[[Brendan O'Carroll]]\n|years= 2011\u20132013\n|first= 14 March 2011\n|last= 28 January 2013\n|classification = Former; regular\n|born=\n|birthplace = \n|occupation = Priest\n}}\n\n'''Father Quinn''' is the former priest of the local parish in Finglas.\n\nFather Quinn is first seen when Agnes and Winnie crash the funeral party of Paddy Murphy, believing that it's where Maria's hen party is. He comforts Murphy's widow as Agnes and Winnie leave embarrassed. He begins to lose faith and turns to alcohol when a group of [[Mormons]] begin converting locals. In 2012, he leaves Finglas to go to rehab, at which point, Father Damien replaces him. After returning from rehab, he is quick to drink again after having seen Agnes again, who offers him a bottle, together with an incident involving Dermot's mobile phone, which she believes is stolen and hiding it in her bloomers; unfortunately, Buster rings it, causing Agnes to go crazy.

Later, he comes to blows with Agnes over the issue of whether Bono will be attending the notorious local school, St Stephen's. Mark and Betty want Bono to go to school outside the parish, and Agnes, fearful of Bono getting bullied if he goes to St Stephen's, agrees with them, but Father McBride refuses to sign the form to allow it to happen, saying that too many good children are leaving the parish. However, Lulu quickly makes him change his mind, after she says \"Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Or is it Father McBride?\", \"Who's for a ride on Father McBride?\" and \"Ooh, that's a big one!\". Fearful of his reputation, Father McBride asks to take care of Lulu. Agnes agrees, but only if he will sign the form; he reluctantly agrees.\n\nFather McBride reappears in [[Mrs. Brown's Boys D'Movie|the movie]], officiating at the funeral for Mary Moccasin. After a four-year absence from the screen, McBride returned, in the 2018 Christmas special \"Exotic Mammy\", as one of the three judges, alongside Hillary Nicholson and Dr. Flynn, in Father Damien's Christmas house decorating competition. Here, he is mentioned as being the priest of another parish, and has a considerably friendlier personality than he did in \"Who's a Pretty Mammy?\"\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Mr. Foley===\n{{Infobox soap character \n|series = [[Mrs. Brown's Boys]]\n|name= Mr. Foley\n|portrayer=[[Smug Roberts]] <small>(2011\u20132012)</small><br>Mike Nolan <small>(2013\u2013)</small>\n|years= 2011\u20132020\n|introducer=[[Brendan O'Carroll]]\n|first= 21 February 2011\n|last= 1 January 2020\n|classification = Present; regular\n|born=\n|birthplace = \n|occupation = Pub landlord\n|sons = Josh Foley<br>Oliver Foley\n|daughters = Nicole Foley\n}}\n\n'''Mr. Foley''' is the landlord of Foley's Pub.\n\nMr. Foley appears mostly in unspeaking roles behind the bar, but has spoken occasionally.

The two have a deep rivalry, and are sometimes quite horrible to each other, examples of which include: Agnes forcing Grandad to sing a Western song and hitting him with a tray, Grandad trapping Agnes behind the Christmas tree, Agnes trying to get rid of Grandad for two weeks and Grandad referring to her as \"The Twat\".\n\nDespite their animosity to each other, Agnes and Grandad have been shown to genuinely care for each other, even if they conceal it very well. On Valentine's Day, Grandad gave flowers to Agnes and admitted that he thought his son was foolish for taking Agnes for granted. On another occasion, when Grandad was to go to the hospital for tests, Grandad admitted to Agnes that he was afraid, prompting Agnes to give him a pep talk to boost his spirits.\n\nWhen the Brown children were growing up, Grandad played a small role in their lives. He would take them on a walk to the betting shop where he would spend the day. He still looks out for the children, but not as much. Bono enjoys playing (or in his view, tormenting) with him.

He was offered a promotion at work, but turned it down. The subsequent result was that Betty kicked him out and he turned up at his mother's house, depressed and tired. He turned down the job because, despite attending school for eight years and not missing a single day, he did not learn to read or write. Agnes, feeling guilty, blamed herself until Cathy pointed out that if in eight years he failed to learn, it was the teachers fault. The problem is resolved when Betty says that she is determined to teach him.\n\nLater on, there was no work going in the carpenter world, and Mark was made redundant. He and Betty had no other choice than to up sticks to Australia. Mark was reluctant to tell his mother, but Betty forced him to. Although putting on a brave face, it mortified Agnes, who sat silent for the rest of the day. The visas for the three came through, and Agnes found it even harder. However, Betty asked Cathy to print something at work for her. Cathy did so and soon, Mark found himself with more work than he could handle. The sheets that were photocopied turned out to be leaflets, which Betty posted through letterboxes. The family didn't emigrate to Australia, and the couple let their son Bono \u2013 Agnes's favourite relative \u2013 break the good news.\n\nMark and Betty are much more well-off than the other family members.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Rory Brown===\n\n{{Infobox soap character \n|series = [[Mrs. Brown's Boys]]\n|name= Rory Brown\n|portrayer=[[Rory Cowan]] (2011\u20132017)<br>Pat \"Pepsi\" Shields (2017 tour)<br>Damien McKiernan (2017\u2013)\n|introducer=[[Brendan O'Carroll]]\n|years= 2011\u2013\n|first= 21 February 2011\n|classification = Present; regular\n|born=circa 1965\n|occupation = Hairdresser\n|father = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Redser Brown|Redser Brown]]\n|mother = [[Agnes Brown]]\n|husband = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Dino Doyle|Dino Doyle]] (2013\u2013)\n|brothers = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Mark Brown|Mark Brown]]<br>[[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Dermot Brown|Dermot Brown]]<br>[[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Trevor Brown|Trevor Brown]]<br>[[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Frankie Brown|Frankie Brown]] <small>(debatable)</small><br>[[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Simon Brown|Simon Brown]] <small>(debatable)</small>\n|sisters = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Cathy Brown|Cathy Brown]]\n|aunts = Dolly\n|uncles = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Terry Brown|Terry Brown]]\n|nephews = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Bono Brown|Bono Brown]]<br>John Brown<br>George Brown<br>Ringo Brown\n|grandfathers = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Grandad|Harold Brown]]\n}}\n\n'''Rory Brown''' is the third son of the Brown family.\n\nRory Brown is the only homosexual in the family, a fact acknowledged by all of his family members except his mother, who seemed completely oblivious to the fact until she realises this with Cathy's intervention in \"Mammy of the Groom\".

It is also hinted at later on in that episode when Agnes is having a discussion with Cathy and she says that Rory wants to tell her something, but is afraid that it will hurt her. This is also hinted at even more when the family is discussing who is coming to Dermot and Maria's wedding, when Rory said that he won't be bringing a girl. Rory was also apparently caught wearing his sister's communion dress when he was about 10.\n\nAgnes is the only character not to know about his homosexuality up until \"Mammy of the Groom\" where she describes it as an illness.

He was very nearly not home for one Christmas, much to Agnes's dismay (everyone else knew). However, in the middle of the party, Trevor walks through the door and Agnes bursts into tears, overjoyed. When he leaves for the missions in Series Two, he tells his mother that he doesn't want a big fuss like last time, his exact words being \"no cake, no decorations, no brass band and please, Mammy, ''no tears''\". Agnes disobeys him and orders everything. Another Christmas time, Agnes is reading the letters her children sent to [[Father Christmas]], and reads Trevor's.

Betty spends her nights down at Foley's with Cathy, Maria, Agnes, and Winnie. She does not like snakes.\n\nWhen Mark, Betty, and Bono were thinking of moving to Australia, Betty was keener to move than her husband and son. She had already started packing before the visas arrived! However, upon seeing how much it would destroy Agnes if they did move, Betty wrote out some leaflets and asked Cathy to photocopy them at her workplace.

Her mother Hilary is a snob and dislikes Agnes intensely. Maria loves the family though, and she and Dermot live with Agnes until they find their own place. Maria was more desperate to find a house than Dermot was, as she did not enjoy the cramped atmosphere. She once stated that she wanted a divorce though this was most likely a lie so she could get out of telling Agnes that Rory and Dino got married in a private ceremony. A nurse by profession, Maria spends her nights at Foley's with Agnes, Winnie, Cathy, and Betty. She is not often seen with the triplets, so it is presumed that either Hilary or a paid babysitter watches them during the day.\n\nAlthough several members of Maria's family have been mentioned throughout the series, none have actually appeared onscreen with the exception of her mother. Other family members include her cousin Bethany who, upon hearing that she was marrying Dermot, said \"you aren't marrying that scumbag, are you?\" and was bridesmaid at the wedding.

It is revealed that Cathy tipped them off at Customs as drug smugglers to get back at Mick.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Professor Thomas Clowne===\n{{Infobox soap character \n|series = [[Mrs. Brown's Boys]]\n|name=Professor Thomas Clowne\n|portrayer=Mike Pyatt\n|introducer=[[Brendan O'Carroll]]\n|years= 2012\u20132013\n|first=16 January 2012\n|last= 7 January 2013\n|classification = Former; recurring\n|born=\n|birthplace = \n|occupation = Psychology professor\n|cousins = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Maria Brown|Maria Brown]]<br>Bethany\n|uncles = Johnathan Nicholson\n|aunts = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Hilary Nicholson|Hilary Nicholson]]<br>Mary Sheridan\n|relatives = John Brown<br>George Brown<br>Ringo Brown<br>John Sheridan<br>James Nicholson\n}}\n\n'''Professor Thomas Clowne''' is the former boyfriend of [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Cathy Brown|Cathy Brown]].  According to Cathy, his surname is pronounced \"Cloon\" but Agnes insists on pronouncing it \"Clown\", suffice to say she doesn't like him.\n\nThomas first appears in the episode \"iMammy (Batteries Not Included)\" in Series 2 and appeared in two episodes of Series 2 (\"SuperMammy\" and \"Mammy's Going\") he is keen to interview Agnes for a book but she ends up making him talk about his mother not liking him.\n\nHis last appearance is in Series 3 in the episode \"Mammy's Inflation\", where he asks Cathy to look after his dog for a year whilst he went to a university in America. As Cathy was expecting a marriage proposal she is angry that he wants her to mind his dog and leaves him.\n\nThomas is also a cousin of Maria as mentioned in the original series and live tour.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Gaston===\n{{Infobox soap character \n|series = [[Mrs. Brown's Boys]]\n|name= Gaston\n|portrayer=Robbie Telfer\n|introducer=[[Brendan O'Carroll]]\n|years= 2017\n|appeared= 1 January 2017\n|classification= Former; guest\n|birthplace = France\n|occupation = Businessman\n}}\n\n'''Gaston''' (or Crouton, as Agnes calls him) is a former boyfriend of Cathy, he is French, very antisocial, and extremely dominant of Cathy.  One good example of this is when he was calling Sharon \"Servant Woman\" and barking orders at Cathy constantly.   Sharon stated that his personality had nothing to do with him being French as she has met many nice Frenchmen before.  Agnes describes him as having \"the personality of a speed bump\". He calls Cathy 'Kitty' every time he addresses her, which annoys Agnes; it annoys her even more when he announces to Cathy that her family is disgraceful and that he will not put up with their camaraderie anymore, and even more so when he says that Agnes is \"lower class than an Olive Farmer's Concubine\". This prompts Agnes to headbutt him, which annoys him to the point where he calls her \"a camel's scrotum\", which prompts Cathy to kick him in the groin area and dump him.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Others==\n\n===Buster Brady===\n{{Infobox soap character \n|series = [[Mrs. Brown's Boys]]\n|name= Buster Brady\n|portrayer=Danny O'Carroll\n|introducer=[[Brendan O'Carroll]]\n|years= 2011\u2013\n|first= 7 March 2011\n|classification = Present; regular\n|born=1988\n|birthplace = \n|occupation = Career criminal\n|father = Unnamed father\n|mother = Unnamed mother\n|sons = Blister Brady\n|grandparents = Unnamed grandparents (deceased)\n|relatives = Sadie Brady (possible relative)<br>\n}}\n\n'''Buster Brady''' is the [[breakout character]] in Mrs. Brown and Dermot's criminal best friend.\n\nBuster almost never budges from his regular outfit, consisting of a baseball cap, a jacket (he wears three or four different jackets), tracksuit bottoms, and white trainers, exceptions including when he wore his Best Man's suit for Dermot and Maria's wedding, although he was still wearing his cap and trainers, and when he played the angel in the Nativity in The Virgin Mammy for which he wore a white cap. Buster's jacket and trousers both have security tags attached, implying they are stolen, and he almost never wears his cap backwards, except only briefly in series 3 episode 6 \"Mammy Swings!\" when he tried to get a sneak peek at Agnes's new kitchen. He also occasionally wears costumes, similar to what Dermot wears, when he helps him at work.\n\nBuster often comes up with scams and wheezes to earn money or to gain something for his own benefit, often roping Dermot in as an accomplice. He is very much disliked by Mrs Brown who sees him as a bad influence on Dermot; however she occasionally warms to him, such as when she lets him stay for a family Christmas dinner as he had no close family of his own to spend it with, and again at New Year. She also recognises that he is genuinely Dermot's friend and cares about Dermot. Agnes states this when Maria will not allow him to be Dermot's best man.\nBuster himself seems very fond of Mrs Brown, seemingly oblivious to her dislike for him.\n\nBuster is somewhat unintelligent, and frequently says stupid or irritating things with little regard for how others will react. However, he has on several occasions displayed a certain amount of cunning; for example, when he and Dermot were competing for a contract against another promotion company, Buster sabotaged their rivals by stealing their boxes of flyers and replacing them with Dermot and Buster's flyers, ultimately resulting in Dermot and Buster being awarded the contract.\n\nIt is unknown if Buster is related to Sadie Brady, at whose party Agnes and Redser met. In \"Mammy's Widow Memories\", Buster says that his birth year is 1988 which would make him either 31 or 32.\n\nBuster is in love with Cathy, as shown in several episodes; this is normally played for laughs with him either being inappropriate or outright rejected. However in the episode \"Mammy's Gamble\", he learned that Cathy was planning to attempt to conceive via artificial insemination and offered to marry her to give her a child, and a father for the child, saying he\u2019d always loved her. Cathy was actually touched and whilst she said no and that she didn't love him, she said it was the weirdest and sweetest proposal she\u2019d ever had.\n\nIn \"Mammy's Hotel\", Buster meets his son Blister.\n\nBuster is portrayed by O'Carroll's real-life son, Danny O'Carroll, and is the real-life husband of Amanda Woods (Betty Brown) and father of Jamie (Bono Brown) and Blake O'Carroll (Blister Brady).<ref name=\"autogenerated\"/>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Hillary Nicholson===\n{{Infobox soap character \n|series = [[Mrs. Brown's Boys]]\n|name= Hillary Nicholson\n|portrayer= [[Sorcha Cusack]] <small>(2011)</small><br>[[Susie Blake]] <small>(2011\u2013)</small>\n|introducer=[[Brendan O'Carroll]]\n|years= 2011\u20132015, 2017\u2013\n|first= 28 February 2011\n|classification = Present; regular\n|born=\n|birthplace = England\n|occupation = Housewife<br>secretary of the school board\n|father = John Sheridan\n|sisters = Mary Sheridan\n|husband = Sinbad Nicholson (original series)<br>Johnathan Nicholson\n|daughters = [[List of Mrs. Brown's Boys characters#Maria Brown|Maria Brown]]\n|nephews = Thomas Clowne\n|nieces = Bethany\n|grandsons = John Brown<br>George Brown<br>Ringo Brown\n}}\n\n'''Hillary Nicholson''' (n\u00e9e '''Sheridan''') is the snobbish mother of Maria and the maternal grandmother of the Brown triplets.\n\nDespite her rich background, her great-grandfather made a living by pushing a cart of dead dogs around the streets. Bar Dermot, Hillary looks down on the Brown family at first but is gradually getting used to them and their surroundings. She is very protective of her daughter, and when planning Dermot and Maria's wedding, thinks of relocating the ceremony to Italy. However, she changes her mind when Agnes reminds her that her father, John, was the vicar at St. Jarleth's Church \u2013 and he hasn't been seen since the money from the collection disappeared. Hillary may seem snobbish and acts like she couldn't care less, but deep down she can be kind and caring.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Dr. Flynn===\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series = [[Mrs. Brown's Boys]]\n|name= Dr. Flynn\n|portrayer=Derek Riddin\n|introducer=[[Brendan O'Carroll]]\n|years= 2011\u2013\n|first= 21 February 2011\n|classification = Present; regular\n|born=\n|birthplace =\n|occupation = Doctor\n|aunts = Sheila Flynn\n}}\n\n'''Dr. Flynn''' is [[Finglas]]' resident doctor.\n\nDr. Flynn usually appears in the Brown household attending to Grandad. He is shown to be very capable in his job, despite Agnes often interfering when he is treating Grandad. He also gave Agnes her wish to have Grandad tested for mental problems, for him to be put in a home while she goes to the [[Galway Races]].\n\nDr. Flynn is shown to have a minor romantic interest in Cathy. He also became self-appointed Head Judge of the judging panel of Father Damien's Christmas house decorating competition, and abused his position by giving the prize (two tickets to go see the Finglas Warriors football team in the finals) to his aunt, Sheila.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Father Damien===\n{{Infobox soap character \n|series = [[Mrs. Brown's Boys]]\n|name= Father Damien\n|portrayer=Conor Moloney\n|introducer=[[Brendan O'Carroll]]\n|years= 2012\u2013\n|first= 24 December 2012\n|classification = Present; regular\n|born=\n|birthplace = \n|occupation = Priest\n}}\n\n'''Father Damien''' is the current priest of the local parish in [[Finglas]].\n\nFather Damien is first seen when Hillary introduces him to Agnes after he comes to Finglas to replace Father Quinn. He is strong to protest against Agnes' play version of [[Nativity of Jesus|the Nativity]]. However, he gives in and gets permission from the Bishop once Agnes gets him to make amends with his own mother over the phone. He baptizes the Brown triplets and later visits Agnes, but accidentally causes her to act-up after he accidentally says one of the hypnosis words that turns her into a stripper (as the hypnotist at the baptism party didn't completely remove the hypnosis from her). When Rory and Dino are getting married, he tells Agnes (despite her protests) that he cannot bless them as the Church is against same-sex marriage. But he later shows up at the Brown house to celebrate their marriage as he personally is happy to celebrate all forms of love.\n\nFather Damien also appears in ''All Round to Mrs Brown's'', where he along with Trevor, hosts a segment called \"Thought for the Day\". In a rather marked contrast to his series self, Father Damien is shown here to be rather childish, often providing non-sequiturs and rather humorous lines to the segment, with Trevor serving as the \"straight man\" in the act.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Father Quinn===\n{{Infobox soap character \n|series = [[Mrs. Brown's Boys]]\n|name= Father Quinn\n|portrayer=Gary Lilburn\n|introducer=[[Brendan O'Carroll]]\n|years= 2011\u20132013\n|first= 14 March 2011\n|last= 28 January 2013\n|classification = Former; regular\n|born=\n|birthplace = \n|occupation = Priest\n}}\n\n'''Father Quinn''' is the former priest of the local parish in Finglas.\n\nFather Quinn is first seen when Agnes and Winnie crash the funeral party of Paddy Murphy, believing that it's where Maria's hen party is. He comforts Murphy's widow as Agnes and Winnie leave embarrassed. He begins to lose faith and turns to alcohol when a group of [[Mormons]] begin converting locals. In 2012, he leaves Finglas to go to rehab, at which point, Father Damien replaces him. After returning from rehab, he is quick to drink again after having seen Agnes again, who offers him a bottle, together with an incident involving Dermot's mobile phone, which she believes is stolen and hiding it in her bloomers; unfortunately, Buster rings it, causing Agnes to go crazy. He leaves the series and returns to rehab, where he is presumed to be currently.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Father McBride===\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series = Mrs. Brown's Boys\n|name= Father McBride\n|portrayer= Jimmy Gibney\n|introducer= Brendan O'Carroll\n|years= 2013\u20132014, 2018\n|first= 30 December 2013 <small>(Ireland)</small><br>1 January 2014 <small>(UK)</small>\n|last = 25 December 2018\n|classification = Former; regular\n|occupation = Priest}}\n\n'''Father McBride''' is a priest who appeared in the 2013 New Year Special, \"Who's a Pretty Mammy?\" He encourages Agnes to take care of Lulu, a pet parrot that belonged to the late Mary Sheridan, sister to Hillary Nicholson and aunt to Maria. Later, he comes to blows with Agnes over the issue of whether Bono will be attending the notorious local school, St Stephen's. Mark and Betty want Bono to go to school outside the parish, and Agnes, fearful of Bono getting bullied if he goes to St Stephen's, agrees with them, but Father McBride refuses to sign the form to allow it to happen, saying that too many good children are leaving the parish. However, Lulu quickly makes him change his mind, after she says \"Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Or is it Father McBride?\", \"Who's for a ride on Father McBride?\" and \"Ooh, that's a big one!\". Fearful of his reputation, Father McBride asks to take care of Lulu. Agnes agrees, but only if he will sign the form; he reluctantly agrees.\n\nFather McBride reappears in [[Mrs. Brown's Boys D'Movie|the movie]], officiating at the funeral for Mary Moccasin. After a four-year absence from the screen, McBride returned, in the 2018 Christmas special \"Exotic Mammy\", as one of the three judges, alongside Hillary Nicholson and Dr. Flynn, in Father Damien's Christmas house decorating competition. Here, he is mentioned as being the priest of another parish, and has a considerably friendlier personality than he did in \"Who's a Pretty Mammy?\"\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Mr. Foley===\n{{Infobox soap character \n|series = [[Mrs. Brown's Boys]]\n|name= Mr. Foley\n|portrayer=[[Smug Roberts]] <small>(2011\u20132012)</small><br>Mike Nolan <small>(2013\u2013)</small>\n|years= 2011\u20132020\n|introducer=[[Brendan O'Carroll]]\n|first= 21 February 2011\n|last= 1 January 2020\n|classification = Present; regular\n|born=\n|birthplace = \n|occupation = Pub landlord\n|sons = Josh Foley<br>Oliver Foley\n|daughters = Nicole Foley\n}}\n\n'''Mr. Foley''' is the landlord of Foley's Pub.\n\nMr. Foley appears mostly in unspeaking roles behind the bar, but has spoken occasionally.
