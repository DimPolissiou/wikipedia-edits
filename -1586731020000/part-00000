In 1955, the museum moved to its current location on Union Avenue near [[Saratoga Race Course|Saratoga race course]], at which time inductions into the hall of fame began. Each spring, following the tabulation of the final votes, the announcement of new inductees is made, usually during [[Kentucky Derby]] Week in early May. The actual inductions are held in mid-August during the [[Saratoga Race Course|Saratoga]] race meeting.\n\nThe Hall of Fame's nominating committee selects eight to ten candidates from among the four Contemporary categories (male horse, female horse, jockey and trainer) to be presented to the voters. Changes in voting procedures that commenced with the 2010 candidates allow the voters to choose multiple candidates from a single Contemporary category, instead of a single candidate from each of the four Contemporary categories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/sports/horse/news/story?id=4962597|title=Racing Hall of Fame changes voting procedures|date=3 March 2010|website=ESPN.com}}</ref> For example, in 2016, two female horses (Rachel Alexandra and Zenyatta) were inducted at the same time.\n\nThe museum also houses a large collection of art, artifacts, and memorabilia that document the history of horse racing from the eighteenth century to the present.\n\n==History==\nThe museum first opened its doors in 1951, at which time it occupied a single room in Saratoga's [[Canfield Casino]]. The establishment was supported by the city of [[Saratoga Springs]], which donated $2,500, the Saratoga Racing Association, which donated $5,000, and various patrons of the sport, who also donated various pieces of art and memorabilia. The first item in the museum's collection was a horseshoe worn by the great [[Lexington (horse)|Lexington]].<ref name=\"EvolvedPt1\">{{cite web |last1=Goode |first1=Kristen Ingwell |title=Racing's Hall of Fame Evolved From Humble Beginnings |url=https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/192192/racings-hall-of-fame-evolved-from-humble-beginnings |website=BloodHorse.com |accessdate=9 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1955, the museum relocated to its current location on Union Avenue, close to the main entrance of [[Saratoga Race Course]]. Inductions into the hall of fame began at the same time. Since then, the museum has expanded several times to allow for the display of its extensive art collection and more multimedia displays on the history of the sport.<ref name=EvolvedPt1 />\n\n==Horses in the Hall of Fame==\n[[File:HorseracingHallofFame.jpg|thumb|The Hall of Fame gallery at the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga]]\nIn the early years, inductions to the hall of fame were based on the evaluation of a panel of racing historians. In 1955, a group of 9 horses from the earliest years of the American turf were inducted.<ref name=\"EvolvedPt2\">{{cite web |title=Hall of Fame: Humble Beginnings (Cont.) |url=https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/192191/hall-of-fame-humble-beginnings-cont |website=BloodHorse.com |accessdate=9 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref> The 1956 class included 11 horses that raced around the turn of the century, while the 1957 class included 10 horses that raced up to the mid-thirties. Since then, the classes have been significantly smaller as the inductions shifted to more contemporary horses. Under current rules, a horse must have been retired for a minimum of five full calendar years to be eligible for the hall of fame. Thoroughbreds remain eligible in the contemporary category between five and 25 calendar years following their final racing year. Thoroughbreds retired for more than 25 calendar years may become eligible through the Historic Review Committee.<ref name=EvolvedPt1 /><ref name=Eligibility>{{cite web|title=Eligibility, Nomination and Election - National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|url=https://www.racingmuseum.org/eligibility-nomination-and-election|website=www.racingmuseum.org|accessdate=4 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n|-\n!Photo!!Name!!Inducted!!Career Years!!Starts!!Wins\n|-\n| [[File:1992APIndy (2).jpg|100px]]||[[A.P.

In 1955, the museum moved to its current location on Union Avenue near [[Saratoga Race Course|Saratoga race course]], at which time inductions into the hall of fame began. Each spring, following the tabulation of the final votes, the announcement of new inductees is made, usually during [[Kentucky Derby]] Week in early May. The actual inductions are held in mid-August during the [[Saratoga Race Course|Saratoga]] race meeting.\n\nThe Hall of Fame's nominating committee selects eight to ten candidates from among the four Contemporary categories (male horse, female horse, jockey and trainer) to be presented to the voters. Changes in voting procedures that commenced with the 2010 candidates allow the voters to choose multiple candidates from a single Contemporary category, instead of a single candidate from each of the four Contemporary categories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/sports/horse/news/story?id=4962597|title=Racing Hall of Fame changes voting procedures|date=3 March 2010|website=ESPN.com}}</ref> For example, in 2016, two female horses (Rachel Alexandra and Zenyatta) were inducted at the same time.\n\nThe museum also houses a large collection of art, artifacts, and memorabilia that document the history of horse racing from the eighteenth century to the present.\n\n==History==\nThe museum first opened its doors in 1951, at which time it occupied a single room in Saratoga's [[Canfield Casino]]. The establishment was supported by the city of [[Saratoga Springs]], which donated $2,500, the Saratoga Racing Association, which donated $5,000, and various patrons of the sport, who also donated various pieces of art and memorabilia. The first item in the museum's collection was a horseshoe worn by the great [[Lexington (horse)|Lexington]].<ref name=\"EvolvedPt1\">{{cite web |last1=Goode |first1=Kristen Ingwell |title=Racing's Hall of Fame Evolved From Humble Beginnings |url=https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/192192/racings-hall-of-fame-evolved-from-humble-beginnings |website=BloodHorse.com |accessdate=9 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1955, the museum relocated to its current location on Union Avenue, close to the main entrance of [[Saratoga Race Course]]. Inductions into the hall of fame began at the same time. Since then, the museum has expanded several times to allow for the display of its extensive art collection and more multimedia displays on the history of the sport.<ref name=EvolvedPt1 />\n\n==Horses in the Hall of Fame==\n[[File:HorseracingHallofFame.jpg|thumb|The Hall of Fame gallery at the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga]]\nIn the early years, inductions to the hall of fame were based on the evaluation of a panel of racing historians. In 1955, a group of 9 horses from the earliest years of the American turf were inducted.<ref name=\"EvolvedPt2\">{{cite web |title=Hall of Fame: Humble Beginnings (Cont.) |url=https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/192191/hall-of-fame-humble-beginnings-cont |website=BloodHorse.com |accessdate=9 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref> The 1956 class included 11 horses that raced around the turn of the century, while the 1957 class included 10 horses that raced up to the mid-thirties. Since then, the classes have been significantly smaller as the inductions shifted to more contemporary horses. Under current rules, a horse must have been retired for a minimum of five full calendar years to be eligible for the hall of fame. Thoroughbreds remain eligible in the contemporary category between five and 25 calendar years following their final racing year. Thoroughbreds retired for more than 25 calendar years may become eligible through the Historic Review Committee.<ref name=EvolvedPt1 /><ref name=Eligibility>{{cite web|title=Eligibility, Nomination and Election - National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|url=https://www.racingmuseum.org/eligibility-nomination-and-election|website=www.racingmuseum.org|accessdate=4 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n|-\n!Photo!!Name!!Inducted!!Career Years!!Starts!!Wins\n|-\n| [[File:1992APIndy (2).jpg|100px]]||[[A.P.

They may provide a color contrast, for example when [[chive]]s are sprinkled on [[potato]]es. They may make a [[cocktail]] more visually appealing, such as when a [[cocktail umbrella]] is added to an exotic drink, or when a [[Mai Tai]] is topped with any number of tropical [[fruit]] pieces. [[Sushi]] may be garnished with ''baran'', a type of plastic grass or leaf. Sometimes a garnish and a condiment will be used together to finish the presentation of a dish; for example, an [[entr\u00e9e]] could be topped with a [[sauce]], as the condiment, along with a sprig of parsley as a garnish.\n\nA garnish may be so readily identified with a specific dish that the dish may appear incomplete without the garnish. Examples include a [[banana split]] [[sundae]] with [[Maraschino cherry|cherries]] on top or [[buffalo wings]] served with [[celery]] stick garnish and [[blue cheese dressing]].\n\n==List of

Some garnishes are selected mainly to augment the visual impact of the plate, while others are selected specifically for the flavor they may impart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foodterms.com/encyclopedia/garnish/index.html|title=Garnish|work=Food Encyclopedia|publisher=Food Network|accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref> This is in contrast to a [[condiment]], a prepared sauce added to another food item primarily for its flavor. A food item which is served with garnish may be described as being '''garni''', the [[French language|French]] term for 'garnished'.\n\nMany garnishes are not intended to be eaten, though for some it is fine to do so. [[Parsley]] is an example of a traditional garnish; this pungent green [[herb]] has small distinctly shaped leaves, firm stems, and is easy to trim into a garnish.\n\n==Overview==\nA garnish makes food or drink items more visually appealing.<ref name=\"Niz 2014\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vegetablefruitcarving.com/how-to-garnish/|title=How To Garnish The Easy Way!|publisher=VegetableFruitCarving.com|accessdate=1 September 2012}}</ref> They may, for example, enhance their color,<ref name=\"Niz 2014\"/> such as when [[paprika]] is sprinkled on a [[salmon]] salad. They may provide a color contrast, for example when [[chive]]s are sprinkled on [[potato]]es. They may make a [[cocktail]] more visually appealing, such as when a [[cocktail umbrella]] is added to an exotic drink, or when a [[Mai Tai]] is topped with any number of tropical [[fruit]] pieces. [[Sushi]] may be garnished with ''baran'', a type of plastic grass or leaf. Sometimes a garnish and a condiment will be used together to finish the presentation of a dish; for example, an [[entr\u00e9e]] could be topped with a [[sauce]], as the condiment, along with a sprig of parsley as a garnish.\n\nA garnish may be so readily identified with a specific dish that the dish may appear incomplete without the garnish. Examples include a [[banana split]] [[sundae]] with [[Maraschino cherry|cherries]] on top or [[buffalo wings]] served with [[celery]] stick garnish and [[blue cheese dressing]].\n\n==List of

''Peter Pan'' had first been shown live on TV by NBC in 1955, and been repeated (again live) by public demand in 1956. Its enormous success on television ushered in a temporary \"fad\" of mostly live family-oriented specials based on fantasy tales, such as ''[[Aladdin (1958 film)|Aladdin]]'' (1958, and no relation to the Disney film that came out 34 years later), ''Alice in Wonderland'' (1955) (a live-action version), [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Cinderella (Rodgers and Hammerstein musical)|Cinderella]]'' (1957), ''[[The Pied Piper of Hamelin (1957 film)|The Pied Piper of Hamelin]]'' (1957), and ''[[Pinocchio (1957 TV program)|Pinocchio]]'' (1957, no relation to the Disney film). As part of this trend, CBS bought the rights from MGM to telecast ''The Wizard of Oz''.\n\nFor the first TV broadcast of ''The Wizard of Oz'', the normally 90-minute ''Ford Star Jubilee'' was expanded to a full two hours to accommodate the entire film, which, in addition to having commercial breaks, was celebrity [[Television presenter|hosted]]. The main reason that CBS arranged for a host for the film was that at 101-minutes, the film was not considered long enough to run in the allotted 120-minute slot at that time, even with commercial breaks, without additional content to pad the entire telecast out to two hours.<ref>''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', {{Clarify|page needed|date=December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe 1956 television debut of the film marked the only time any actor who had appeared in the movie was selected to host the broadcast: [[Bert Lahr]], who played the Cowardly Lion (and his Kansas farmhand counterpart Zeke) in the film, appeared alongside the daughter of [[Judy Garland]], a then 10 year-old [[Liza Minnelli]], and young Oz expert Justin G. Schiller. [[Lorna Luft]], Minnelli's half-sister, did not appear as she was only four years old at the time, although she did have her picture taken with Minnelli in a promotional photo. Unlike several of the other ''Oz'' telecasts, apparently no stills were taken during the hosting sequences in 1956.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989</ref> The practice of a show business celebrity regularly \"hosting\" ''The Wizard of Oz'' lasted from the film's first television showing until 1968, when the film went to NBC after being shown on CBS nine times.\n\nThe film was always presented uncut in a two-hour time slot between 1956 and 1968, despite having commercials and hosted segments. The Professor Marvel sequence has never been omitted (at least in American telecasts of the film),{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and the tracking shot of [[Munchkinland]] was not edited until the film went to NBC in 1968.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe film's first broadcast received positive critical notices in newspapers the following day. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine prophetically suggested that the film could be telecast annually and at an earlier time.<ref name=VarReview/><ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989, p.215</ref>\n\nThe film was a ratings success with a [[Nielsen rating]] of 33.9 and an audience share of 53%.<ref name=rating>{{cite magazine|title=Hit Movies on U.S. TV Since 1961|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 24, 1990|page=160}}</ref>\n\n==Telecasts in the pre-cable era==\nThe film was not rebroadcast in 1957 or 1958. For telecasts from 1959 (the year of its second telecast) up until 1998, the film was always shown as a stand-alone [[television special|TV special]] instead of as part of an anthology or movie series. Between 1959 and 1968, and again in 1990 when [[Angela Lansbury]], star of CBS' ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'', hosted the 50th-anniversary telecast, CBS chose its hosts from its then-current [[prime time]] lineup. In 1959, the host was [[Red Skelton]] (''[[The Red Skelton Show]]''); in 1960 it was [[Richard Boone]] (''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel]]''), in 1961 and 1962 it was [[Dick Van Dyke]] (''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]''), and from 1964 through 1967, it was [[Danny Kaye]] (''[[The Danny Kaye Show]]''). Skelton, Boone and Van Dyke brought their then-young children along to appear with them.\n\nAlthough the hosting segments for the 1956 telecast of the film had to be done live, Skelton's, Boone's, Van Dyke's and Kaye's segments were recorded on [[video tape]] in advance of the telecasts.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8wEHQAACAAJ&dq=The+Wizard+of+Oz:+50th+Anniversary+Celebration&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0VCqUb7EFofO9gTM1YGwBg&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA|title=The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History|first1=John|last1=Fricke|first2=Jay|last2=Scarfone|first3=William|last3=Stillman|date=11 September 1990|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|accessdate=11 September 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref> Lansbury's hosting segment was the first one recorded on film.\n\nDuring these years, the hosting sequences were not staged in a run-of-the-mill manner, with the host merely standing in a studio set, but in what could be considered imaginative ways. Richard Boone was taped on the set of his television series ''Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel'', in a \"living room\" with his real son about to watch the film on a TV set. Dick Van Dyke was shown in a living room set with his children,<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> and Danny Kaye's hosting segment featured him sitting on a prop [[toadstool]] against a painted backdrop of the [[Yellow brick road|Yellow Brick Road]] and the [[Emerald City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/jan19-1964/|title=Facts/History/Trivia/Music - Year In Review Video Timeline - 1955 Through 2013|website=www.mrpopculture.com|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref> The Kaye segment did not include a television set as part of its design.\n\nSome humor was sometimes incorporated into these segments. Red Skelton was seen as two characters: Before the film began, he was seen in a studio set of an early 20th-century bookstore, in costume as a [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]]-era storyteller who introduced [[L. Frank Baum]]'s original 1900 novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' to a young girl played by Skelton's real daughter, and at film's end, he appeared in a studio recreation of a modern living room as himself. Danny Kaye reassured viewers not to panic when the film began in black-and-white rather than in color, and encouraged young viewers not to be afraid of the roaring MGM lion at the beginning of the film. No directors or writers were credited for the hosting sequences, just as none are credited for hosting segments prior to films on Turner Classic Movies.\n\n''The Wizard of Oz'' did not become an annual television tradition immediately \u2014 only after the 1959 showing, when, because of the earlier hour at which it was shown (6:00 P.M., E.S.T.), more children tuned into the broadcast, and it gained an even larger television audience than before with a Nielsen rating of 36.5 and an audience share of 58%.<ref name=rating/> The 1959 telecast was especially welcomed by media critic [[John Crosby (media critic)|John Crosby]], who commented in the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', \"Television \u2014 any television \u2014 looks awfully ordinary after ''The Wizard of Oz''\".<ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone. The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History, Warner Books, 1989</ref> From 1959 until 1991, the film was telecast once every year, the one exception being 1963, when it was not telecast at all.\n\n[[WISN-TV]] in [[Milwaukee]], Wisconsin, did not carry the network's yearly ''Oz'' telecast in 1961, the year WISN began its affiliation with CBS, running [[Green Bay Packers]] football instead. However, due to viewer outcry, WISN was able to get permission to run the film locally at 2:00&nbsp;p.m. C.S.T., on Christmas Eve.<ref>\"TV Screen,\" ''The Milwaukee Journal'', Milwaukee, Wisc., 24 December 1961, https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LzsaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DCcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6142%2C1372025</ref>\n\nIn 1978, after the film had returned to CBS, a computer malfunction at the CBS owned-and-operated [[WBBM-TV]] in [[Chicago]] accidentally cut off most of the ending to that year's ''Oz'' telecast, interrupting the final minute with a commercial block that was not supposed to air until after the movie had ended.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Because the break was only 42 seconds long, no attempt was made to override the computer, for fear of making the problem worse.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} For several hours thereafter, WBBM received angry calls from viewers, while those unable to get through chose to voice their displeasure wrote to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' newspapers.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n===\"Wraparound\" opening and closing credits===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nThe film, as telecast on U.S. television between 1959 and 1968, was arguably given a much more elaborate TV presentation than it received afterwards. During those years, it always had videotaped wraparound [[opening credits|opening]] and [[closing credits]] segments devised by CBS, accompanied by the network's own specially recorded opening and closing music based on the film's score. For the opening \"wraparound\" credits, the title '''The Wizard of Oz''' and the names of its five leading actors, [[Judy Garland]], [[Frank Morgan]], [[Ray Bolger]], [[Bert Lahr]] and [[Jack Haley]], were first shown in CBS's own format and [[font]], while an anonymous announcer read them off and then followed this with an announcement of the film's sponsor(s): \"This portion of ''The Wizard of Oz'' is brought to you by...[name of sponsor mentioned]\". These specially-devised opening credits never mentioned that the film was made by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. From 1959 to 1964, CBS created different wraparound credits for each showing, but because the same hosting segment \u2014 the Danny Kaye one \u2014 was shown between 1964 and 1968, audiences saw the same \"wraparound\" credits from 1964 until the film went to NBC.\n\nThe special CBS introduction was followed by the host speaking about the movie for about three minutes or so. Those remarks lead into the actual film, beginning with all of its original 1939 [[opening credits]] (shown against a background of moving clouds), including the MGM [[Leo the Lion (MGM)|Leo the Lion]] logo, the name of the film, the cast list, and the film's principal technical staff, exactly as MGM had created them, with the film's [[main title]] music heard.\n\nThe host reappeared just before the film's second half began, to say a few more words about it, before the telecast proceeded with the rest of the film, commercials included.\n\nHowever, at the end of the movie, the film's closing cast list, as created by MGM, was not be shown, and the title card with \"The End\" right after Dorothy's closing line was never seen on television during these early CBS showings. Instead, immediately after Dorothy spoke her last line (\"Oh, Auntie Em, there's no place like home!\"), and the camera faded out on her, television viewers once again saw CBS's own title card '''The Wizard of Oz''', this time accompanied by some of the film's end title music, exactly as heard on the [[soundtrack]], and the announcer's voice saying that the host for that year would return in a moment. After a final commercial, the host was then seen once again, to bid farewell to the TV audience, and CBS showed its own version of the cast list that appears during the film's end credits. At the end, referring to both the film and the hosting segments, the same announcer declared that \"This has been a film and videotape presentation.\"\n\n===Shown in color===\nFrom the beginning ''The Wizard of Oz'' was telecast in color, although few people owned [[color television]] sets in 1956.  Except for 1961, all U.S. telecasts have been in color, an effect that seemed much more striking in the early 1960s, when there were still relatively few color programs on television. It was not televised in color in 1961 because color telecasts had to be paid for by their sponsors, who declined to do so that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/dec08-1961/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-14 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426051707/http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/dec08-1961/ |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}</ref><ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989, p. 214.</ref> Between 1956 and 1965, the ''Wizard of Oz'' showings were rare exceptions to the black and white program schedule at CBS. During this period, CBS had the ability to broadcast programs in color, but generally chose not to do so unless a sponsor paid for a film or program to be shown in color. During this period, the competing network NBC was owned by [[RCA]], which by 1960 manufactured 95% of the color sets sold in the U.S. Hence, CBS perceived that increased use of color broadcasting would primarily benefit its rival by promoting sales of RCA color television sets.{{Citation needed|reason=According to Steve Hoffman's website, the main reason the CBS did few color telecasts until 1965 is because their initial color broadcasting system was rejected by the Federal Communications Commission in the early 1950s.  A source to back up this claim as a reason should be provided.|date=August 2019}}\n\nNot until the fall of 1965 did color broadcasts play a major role at CBS and ABC, at which time half the network shows from ABC and CBS were being made and shown in color. Meanwhile, all but two NBC prime time shows were in color and most of NBC's daytime shows were. By the fall of 1966, all three networks produced all of their prime time shows in color. By the time the movie went to NBC in 1968, all network shows (except for reruns of black and white movies) were in color.\n\n===Later hosts===\n{{More citations needed|section, except for one footnote, |date=June 2013}}\nPartly because commercial time during programs increased beginning in the late 1960s, the idea of regularly having hosts to introduce the film was dropped when ''The Wizard of Oz'' went to [[NBC]] in 1968, where no \"wraparound\" sequence was shown. The presentation consisted only of the film itself, with its original opening and closing credits, and no special NBC-created credits or hosting segments. The famous [[NBC peacock]] was shown immediately prior to the beginning of the film, with announcer [[Mel Brandt]] saying that \"the first 22 minutes of this program [i.e. the Kansas and tornado sequences] will be shown in black-and-white\", a not quite accurate statement, since the final three minutes of the film also took place in Kansas, and were at that time also shown in black-and-white, rather than in the [[sepia tone]] in which they originally had been made (the sepia was not restored to the Kansas and tornado scenes until 1989, the film's 50th anniversary). However, one NBC telecast featured an on-screen host: the 1970 showing, which opened with veteran actor [[Gregory Peck]] paying tribute to the recently deceased Judy Garland (a segment directed by ''Oz'' producer [[Mervyn LeRoy]], marking his first TV work), although this segment consisted of only a few brief remarks, while the opening hosting segments on CBS had gone on for about three minutes or so. The NBC ''Oz'' telecasts began the tradition of the film's annual showings during the [[Easter]] and [[Passover]] seasons of the year as opposed to the winter showings on [[CBS]].\n\nThe switch in networks resulted because CBS was unwilling to meet MGM's increased price \u2014 fostered by the film's ever increasing popularity \u2014 for renewal of the rights to telecast it.<ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. \"The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History\", Warner Books, 1989.</ref>  The film stayed on NBC until 1976. When CBS, realizing its error in allowing it to go to another network, bought back the rights at MGM's asking price, their viewer ratings shot up, and one executive was heard to remark, \"That picture is better [for the network] than a gushing oil well\".<ref>http://www.docstoc.com/docs/8043642/New-book-sell-sheet</ref>\n\nAfter its 1976 return to CBS, the film was hosted on that network only once more, in a filmed segment featuring Angela Lansbury in 1990, but the CBS \"wraparound\" opening and closing credits were not - and have never been - revived, although, during those years, a blue card featuring a painting of a rainbow and the title '''The Wizard of Oz''' ''was'' shown on the screen while the night's pre-empted programs or programs to be shown at regular time and the sponsors were being announced, and immediately before and after commercial breaks. In the 1980s clips from the film shown on a red background with title was shown at the start, while a still of Emerald City with title was used during commercials. Angela Lansbury also narrated a documentary about the making of the film, originally entitled ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: 50 Years of Magic'' and years later re-titled ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: The Making of a Movie Classic''. It was first shown immediately after the movie's 1990 telecast, and is included as a supplement on all the DVD releases beginning with the 1999 DVD release. [[Jack Haley, Jr.]], the documentary's director, was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for his work.\n\nWhen shown on Turner Classic Movies, ''The Wizard of Oz'' was usually hosted by TCM host [[Robert Osborne]].\n\nOn June 3, 2007, [[Tom Kenny]], the voice of [[SpongeBob SquarePants]], hosted a telecast of the film on Turner Classic Movies, as part of ''Essentials, Jr.'', a special summer series of family movies.\n\nOn July 27, 2008, the film was shown twice in a row on [[Turner Network Television]] without a host, but with commercials, and with \"pop-up\" animated ads for other TNT programs at the bottom of the screen just before and after commercial breaks.\n\nOn March 24 and 25, 2012, the film was hosted on Cartoon Network by television actor [[Robert Wu]], who provides the voice of Mr. Washee Washee in the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode, \"[[Tiegs for Two]]\". This telecast ran two-and-a-half hours, longer than any CBS or NBC telecasts.\n\nOn June 10, 2012, which would have been Judy Garland's 90th birthday, the film was telecast on Turner Classic Movies without commercials, and hosted by comedian [[Bill Hader]], again as part of the ''Essentials, Jr.'' summer series of family films. Unlike the CBS hosting segments which were a part of the 1960s telecasts of the film, Hader's segment showed clips from the film before it actually began.\n\n===Sponsorship===\nBeing a presentation of network TV, ''The Wizard of Oz'' was subject to sponsorship from a variety of advertisers.\n\nThe first telecast of \"Oz\" was a presentation of [[Ford Star Jubilee]] and thus sponsored by [[Ford Motor Company]] and its dealers. In the ensuing years of 1959 thru 1967, the yearly telecast was sponsored by one primary sponsor with a co-sponsor. Perhaps the best remembered examples were the telecasts sponsored by [[Procter and Gamble]] and promoted when the company gave free premiums of hand puppets with packages of some of its most popular products. Many also remember the 1970 telecast presented on NBC by [[Singer Manufacturing Company]] as a tribute to Judy Garland, who had died in June 1969.\n\nIn later years, several different advertisers shared sponsorship; no one advertiser predominated.\n\n===Television ratings===\nThe showing in 1983 was the 25th network prime-time showing, a record then for any film or television special.  In the first nine showings, all on CBS, ''The Wizard of Oz'' gained at least 49% of the television audience.<ref>Harmetz, Aljean \"'Wizard of Oz': A TV Success Story,\" ''New York Times'', March 16, 1983. pg.

When CBS bought the film back from NBC in 1976, it again began to beat episodes of Disney in the ratings. It preempted Disney on one more occasion, after the series moved to that network in the early 1980s.<ref>http://getty.net/texts/tv-67-83.txt</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the first year it was shown on TV in [[high-definition television|high-definition]], the film placed No. 11 in the Nielsen ratings among cable television programs for the week of November 11.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wrestlingclique.com/entertainment/14907-extended-nielsen-ratings-nov-6-12-a.html|title=Extended Nielsen Ratings for Nov 6-12|website=wrestlingclique.com|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Changes made in running time===\nFrom 1968 to 1984, minor cuts were made to the film to make room for added commercial time and in order to have the film \"clock in\" at two hours. No dialogue or singing was removed, only moments such as camera pans and establishing shots, as well as MGM's written [[foreword]] to the film.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nOn a few occasions beginning in 1985, again because of the increased time spent on commercial breaks, the film was time-compressed to fit it into a two-hour running time without cutting it.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> However, ''The Wizard of Oz'' is now always shown complete and at its regular speed on television, both with and without commercials. When shown with ads, the film now runs about two hours and fifteen minutes, simply because of the increase in commercial time.\n\n===March 1991 showing===\nThe March 1991 showing was the first after the film gained protected status from the [[Library of Congress]] and the [[National Film Preservation Board]]. Networks opted to no longer shorten the film by \"microcutting\" a few individual moments throughout the movie as had been done from the late 1960s to the early 1980s to make room for commercials and keep it in a two-hour broadcast. This extended the running time of the film from 8 P.M to 10:07&nbsp;p.m. and sometimes even longer, depending on the amount of time spent on commercials. It was one of the first 50 films selected for this protection.<ref>Glenn Collins, \"A Full-Length 'Oz' for TV.\" ''New York Times''. New York, N.Y.: March 19, 1991, p.

Because both films were still licensed to CBS, Turner and the network negotiated a deal that extended CBS' license for ''Oz'' in exchange for relinquishing its rights to ''Gone with the Wind''.<ref name=TCMnotes>{{cite web | url = http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/852/The-Wizard-of-Oz/notes.html | title= ''The Wizard of Oz'' (1939): Notes | publisher = [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]] | accessdate= 2014-02-08}}</ref> In 1991, the film was shown twice during the year for the first time.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} 1991 also marked the first time since 1956 that the film was shown in November. This also happened in 1993, when the film was telecast in both February and November of that year. The film was not shown on television at all in 1992, 1995 and 1997, marking the first time since 1963 that a year was skipped in showings of the film. Turner, which owned most of the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television library at the time (later owned by Warner Bros.), began moving to make its properties exclusive to Turner-owned outlets in the late 1990s; as such, in 1998, ''The Wizard of Oz'' made its last appearance on CBS, moving exclusively to Turner-owned properties the next year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1998/tv/news/wizard-travels-to-tbs-1117469508/|title=\u2018Wizard\u2019 travels to TBS|last=Kissell|first=Rick|date=1998-04-06|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-30}}</ref>\n\n2000 marked the first time that the film was shown on U.S. television during the summer.

As of April 29, 2013, Turner Classic Movies has shown the film 23 times.\n\n===Differences between network and cable showings===\nIn addition to the frequent cable showings, another difference between showings on NBC, CBS, the WB network, and cable channels is that when the film was shown on CBS and NBC, it was always presented as a special instead of just a televised film. From 1959 until it went to cable, the film was never shown on [[NBC Saturday Night at the Movies]] or any other movie anthology series, and telecasts of the film regularly preempted two hours or more of regular television programming.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nPromos for the CBS and NBC showings during the 1960s began airing on television as much as two weeks in advance of that year's telecast and were still airing as late as 1989.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}  On the major commercial networks, it was never termed a \"CBS Movie Special\" or an \"NBC Movie Special\", as movie specials shown on those networks are frequently termed, but as simply ''The Wizard of Oz''.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n===Aspect ratio===\nThe 1955 and 1998 theatrical re-releases were matted in movie theaters to produce a widescreen effect for the [[Aspect ratio (image)#Cinema terminology|Academy-standard]] [[aspect-ratio]] film.\n\nWhen shown in [[HDTV]], the film is [[pillarbox]]ed so that its aspect ratio is preserved.<ref>http://www.dtvforum.info/index.php?showtopic=43204</ref> On DVD, the film has always been issued in its original 1939 aspect ratio.<ref name=\"dvdtalk.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/39772/wizard-of-oz-the/|title=The Wizard of Oz (Blu-ray)|website=DVD Talk|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"dvdtalk.com\"/><ref>http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/wizardozse.php</ref>\n\n==Outside the United States==\nThe movie has also been shown on television successfully in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]] and is shown every year in [[Australia]], but it has not become the television phenomenon there that it has in the U.S.<ref>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Website</ref> In Indonesia, the film was aired for the first time on the newly-inaugurated television network [[RCTI]] in November 1989, with reruns on other four networks in the 1990s.

It was shown in color although very few people owned color TV sets. This marked the only time it was ever aired that late on a non-cable television network (Turner Broadcasting frequently schedules two showings in a row on the same night, at 8:00 p.m. and 10:15 p.m.). Future showings began earlier in order to allow children to see it more easily. In addition, the prime time hour generally given to affiliates for local programming was taken back in order to run the movie early. This practice continued until the film was sold to NBC.\n*1959 - CBS - Sunday, December 13 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n::The first of the film's annual showings. It was the success of this telecast, which gained a wider audience than the first, that persuaded CBS to make the film an annual tradition on television.\n*1960 - CBS - Sunday, December 11 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1961 - CBS - Sunday, December 10 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m. Only time fully shown in Black & White\n*1962 - CBS - Sunday, December 9 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.  December 16 in Hawaii - 5:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1964 - CBS - Sunday, January 26 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\nThe reason that the film did not air in December 1963 has never been stated, but some say that it was because of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s assassination, others say room needed to be made for more Christmas themed specials and that the movie fit in better during January. For whatever reason, the movie continued to air early in the year rather than late in the year from 1964 until the 1990s.\n*1965 - CBS - Sunday, January 17 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1966 - CBS - Sunday, January 9 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1967 - CBS - Sunday, February 12 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\nLast airing on CBS until 1976.

It remained there for twenty-two more years, a likely record in those years for a film's consecutive showings on one network. Initially the movie aired late winter/early spring, but beginning in 1991, the movie moved back and forth from spring to late fall. Another change was that CBS no longer began the movie before normal prime time. Before 1976, when run on a day other than Sunday, NBC took back the 7 p.m. Eastern / 6 p.m. Central time slots from affiliates to run the movie early enough so children could see it before bedtime. Also, prior to 1968, CBS always took the 6 p.m. hour to run the movie early. Logic was that times have changed and children now stay up a little later than they did in the past. From then on, if shown in a Sunday 6 to 8 or 7 to 9 pm time slot on CBS, the film preempted ''60 Minutes'', so beginning in 1978, CBS executives moved the showings to other nights of the week. If the film was shown on a Sunday, CBS usually scheduled it at 8 pm, so that it did not conflict with ''60 Minutes''. (As of 2017, ''60 Minutes'' continues to air in the same Sunday 7 p.m. time slot on CBS.)\n*1977 - CBS - Sunday, March 20 - 7 p.m.\n*1978 - CBS - Easter Sunday, March 26 - 7 p.m.\n*1979 - CBS - Friday, March 23 - 8 p.m.\n*1980 - CBS - Friday, March 7 - 8 p.m.\n*1981 - CBS - Friday, February 27 - 8 p.m.\n*1982 - CBS - Saturday, March 27 - 8 p.m.\n*1983 - CBS - Friday, March 18 - 8 p.m.\n*1984 - CBS - Friday, March 30 - 8 p.m.\n*1985 - CBS - Friday, March 1 - 8 p.m.\n*1986 - CBS - Saturday, February 15 - 8 p.m.\n*1987 - CBS - Friday, March 6 - 8 p.m.\n*1988 - CBS - Wednesday, February 24 - 8:30&nbsp;p.m.\nDelayed due to a CBS News Special report.\n*1989 - CBS - Sunday, March 18 - 8 p.m.\n*1990 - CBS - Tuesday, February 20 - 8 p.m.\n*1991 - CBS - Tuesday, March 19 - 8 p.m.\nSoundtrack remastered in stereo using CBS StereoSound system.\n*1991 - CBS - Wednesday, November 27 - 8 p.m.\nThe first time the film aired twice in the same year.

''Peter Pan'' had first been shown live on TV by NBC in 1955, and been repeated (again live) by public demand in 1956. Its enormous success on television ushered in a temporary \"fad\" of mostly live family-oriented specials based on fantasy tales, such as ''[[Aladdin (1958 film)|Aladdin]]'' (1958, and no relation to the Disney film that came out 34 years later), ''Alice in Wonderland'' (1955) (a live-action version), [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Cinderella (Rodgers and Hammerstein musical)|Cinderella]]'' (1957), ''[[The Pied Piper of Hamelin (1957 film)|The Pied Piper of Hamelin]]'' (1957), and ''[[Pinocchio (1957 TV program)|Pinocchio]]'' (1957, no relation to the Disney film). As part of this trend, CBS bought the rights from MGM to telecast ''The Wizard of Oz''.\n\nFor the first TV broadcast of ''The Wizard of Oz'', the normally 90-minute ''Ford Star Jubilee'' was expanded to a full two hours to accommodate the entire film, which, in addition to having commercial breaks, was celebrity [[Television presenter|hosted]]. The main reason that CBS arranged for a host for the film was that at 101-minutes, the film was not considered long enough to run in the allotted 120-minute slot at that time, even with commercial breaks, without additional content to pad the entire telecast out to two hours.<ref>''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', {{Clarify|page needed|date=December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe 1956 television debut of the film marked the only time any actor who had appeared in the movie was selected to host the broadcast: [[Bert Lahr]], who played the Cowardly Lion (and his Kansas farmhand counterpart Zeke) in the film, appeared alongside the daughter of [[Judy Garland]], a then 10 year-old [[Liza Minnelli]], and young Oz expert Justin G. Schiller. [[Lorna Luft]], Minnelli's half-sister, did not appear as she was only four years old at the time, although she did have her picture taken with Minnelli in a promotional photo. Unlike several of the other ''Oz'' telecasts, apparently no stills were taken during the hosting sequences in 1956.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989</ref> The practice of a show business celebrity regularly \"hosting\" ''The Wizard of Oz'' lasted from the film's first television showing until 1968, when the film went to NBC after being shown on CBS nine times.\n\nThe film was always presented uncut in a two-hour time slot between 1956 and 1968, despite having commercials and hosted segments. The Professor Marvel sequence has never been omitted (at least in American telecasts of the film),{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and the tracking shot of [[Munchkinland]] was not edited until the film went to NBC in 1968.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe film's first broadcast received positive critical notices in newspapers the following day. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine prophetically suggested that the film could be telecast annually and at an earlier time.<ref name=VarReview/><ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989, p.215</ref>\n\nThe film was a ratings success with a [[Nielsen rating]] of 33.9 and an audience share of 53%.<ref name=rating>{{cite magazine|title=Hit Movies on U.S. TV Since 1961|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=January 24, 1990|page=160}}</ref>\n\n==Telecasts in the pre-cable era==\nThe film was not rebroadcast in 1957 or 1958. For telecasts from 1959 (the year of its second telecast) up until 1998, the film was always shown as a stand-alone [[television special|TV special]] instead of as part of an anthology or movie series. Between 1959 and 1968, and again in 1990 when [[Angela Lansbury]], star of CBS' ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'', hosted the 50th-anniversary telecast, CBS chose its hosts from its then-current [[prime time]] lineup. In 1959, the host was [[Red Skelton]] (''[[The Red Skelton Show]]''); in 1960 it was [[Richard Boone]] (''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel]]''), in 1961 and 1962 it was [[Dick Van Dyke]] (''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]''), and from 1964 through 1967, it was [[Danny Kaye]] (''[[The Danny Kaye Show]]''). Skelton, Boone and Van Dyke brought their then-young children along to appear with them.\n\nAlthough the hosting segments for the 1956 telecast of the film had to be done live, Skelton's, Boone's, Van Dyke's and Kaye's segments were recorded on [[video tape]] in advance of the telecasts.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C8wEHQAACAAJ&dq=The+Wizard+of+Oz:+50th+Anniversary+Celebration&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0VCqUb7EFofO9gTM1YGwBg&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA|title=The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History|first1=John|last1=Fricke|first2=Jay|last2=Scarfone|first3=William|last3=Stillman|date=11 September 1990|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|accessdate=11 September 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref> Lansbury's hosting segment was the first one recorded on film.\n\nDuring these years, the hosting sequences were not staged in a run-of-the-mill manner, with the host merely standing in a studio set, but in what could be considered imaginative ways. Richard Boone was taped on the set of his television series ''Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel'', in a \"living room\" with his real son about to watch the film on a TV set. Dick Van Dyke was shown in a living room set with his children,<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> and Danny Kaye's hosting segment featured him sitting on a prop [[toadstool]] against a painted backdrop of the [[Yellow brick road|Yellow Brick Road]] and the [[Emerald City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/jan19-1964/|title=Facts/History/Trivia/Music - Year In Review Video Timeline - 1955 Through 2013|website=www.mrpopculture.com|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref> The Kaye segment did not include a television set as part of its design.\n\nSome humor was sometimes incorporated into these segments. Red Skelton was seen as two characters: Before the film began, he was seen in a studio set of an early 20th-century bookstore, in costume as a [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]]-era storyteller who introduced [[L. Frank Baum]]'s original 1900 novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' to a young girl played by Skelton's real daughter, and at film's end, he appeared in a studio recreation of a modern living room as himself. Danny Kaye reassured viewers not to panic when the film began in black-and-white rather than in color, and encouraged young viewers not to be afraid of the roaring MGM lion at the beginning of the film. No directors or writers were credited for the hosting sequences, just as none are credited for hosting segments prior to films on Turner Classic Movies.\n\n''The Wizard of Oz'' did not become an annual television tradition immediately \u2014 only after the 1959 showing, when, because of the earlier hour at which it was shown (6:00 P.M., E.S.T.), more children tuned into the broadcast, and it gained an even larger television audience than before with a Nielsen rating of 36.5 and an audience share of 58%.<ref name=rating/> The 1959 telecast was especially welcomed by media critic [[John Crosby (media critic)|John Crosby]], who commented in the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', \"Television \u2014 any television \u2014 looks awfully ordinary after ''The Wizard of Oz''\".<ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone. The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History, Warner Books, 1989</ref> From 1959 until 1991, the film was telecast once every year, the one exception being 1963, when it was not telecast at all.\n\n[[WISN-TV]] in [[Milwaukee]], Wisconsin, did not carry the network's yearly ''Oz'' telecast in 1961, the year WISN began its affiliation with CBS, running [[Green Bay Packers]] football instead. However, due to viewer outcry, WISN was able to get permission to run the film locally at 2:00&nbsp;p.m. C.S.T., on Christmas Eve.<ref>\"TV Screen,\" ''The Milwaukee Journal'', Milwaukee, Wisc., 24 December 1961, https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LzsaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DCcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6142%2C1372025</ref>\n\nIn 1978, after the film had returned to CBS, a computer malfunction at the CBS owned-and-operated [[WBBM-TV]] in [[Chicago]] accidentally cut off most of the ending to that year's ''Oz'' telecast, interrupting the final minute with a commercial block that was not supposed to air until after the movie had ended.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Because the break was only 42 seconds long, no attempt was made to override the computer, for fear of making the problem worse.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} For several hours thereafter, WBBM received angry calls from viewers, while those unable to get through chose to voice their displeasure wrote to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' newspapers.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n===\"Wraparound\" opening and closing credits===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nThe film, as telecast on U.S. television between 1959 and 1968, was arguably given a much more elaborate TV presentation than it received afterwards. During those years, it always had videotaped wraparound [[opening credits|opening]] and [[closing credits]] segments devised by CBS, accompanied by the network's own specially recorded opening and closing music based on the film's score. For the opening \"wraparound\" credits, the title '''The Wizard of Oz''' and the names of its five leading actors, [[Judy Garland]], [[Frank Morgan]], [[Ray Bolger]], [[Bert Lahr]] and [[Jack Haley]], were first shown in CBS's own format and [[font]], while an anonymous announcer read them off and then followed this with an announcement of the film's sponsor(s): \"This portion of ''The Wizard of Oz'' is brought to you by...[name of sponsor mentioned]\". These specially-devised opening credits never mentioned that the film was made by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. From 1959 to 1964, CBS created different wraparound credits for each showing, but because the same hosting segment \u2014 the Danny Kaye one \u2014 was shown between 1964 and 1968, audiences saw the same \"wraparound\" credits from 1964 until the film went to NBC.\n\nThe special CBS introduction was followed by the host speaking about the movie for about three minutes or so. Those remarks lead into the actual film, beginning with all of its original 1939 [[opening credits]] (shown against a background of moving clouds), including the MGM [[Leo the Lion (MGM)|Leo the Lion]] logo, the name of the film, the cast list, and the film's principal technical staff, exactly as MGM had created them, with the film's [[main title]] music heard.\n\nThe host reappeared just before the film's second half began, to say a few more words about it, before the telecast proceeded with the rest of the film, commercials included.\n\nHowever, at the end of the movie, the film's closing cast list, as created by MGM, was not be shown, and the title card with \"The End\" right after Dorothy's closing line was never seen on television during these early CBS showings. Instead, immediately after Dorothy spoke her last line (\"Oh, Auntie Em, there's no place like home!\"), and the camera faded out on her, television viewers once again saw CBS's own title card '''The Wizard of Oz''', this time accompanied by some of the film's end title music, exactly as heard on the [[soundtrack]], and the announcer's voice saying that the host for that year would return in a moment. After a final commercial, the host was then seen once again, to bid farewell to the TV audience, and CBS showed its own version of the cast list that appears during the film's end credits. At the end, referring to both the film and the hosting segments, the same announcer declared that \"This has been a film and videotape presentation.\"\n\n===Shown in color===\nFrom the beginning ''The Wizard of Oz'' was telecast in color, although few people owned [[color television]] sets in 1956.  Except for 1961, all U.S. telecasts have been in color, an effect that seemed much more striking in the early 1960s, when there were still relatively few color programs on television. It was not televised in color in 1961 because color telecasts had to be paid for by their sponsors, who declined to do so that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/dec08-1961/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-14 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426051707/http://www.mrpopculture.com/files/html/dec08-1961/ |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}</ref><ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone. ''The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History'', Warner Books, 1989, p. 214.</ref> Between 1956 and 1965, the ''Wizard of Oz'' showings were rare exceptions to the black and white program schedule at CBS. During this period, CBS had the ability to broadcast programs in color, but generally chose not to do so unless a sponsor paid for a film or program to be shown in color. During this period, the competing network NBC was owned by [[RCA]], which by 1960 manufactured 95% of the color sets sold in the U.S. Hence, CBS perceived that increased use of color broadcasting would primarily benefit its rival by promoting sales of RCA color television sets.{{Citation needed|reason=According to Steve Hoffman's website, the main reason the CBS did few color telecasts until 1965 is because their initial color broadcasting system was rejected by the Federal Communications Commission in the early 1950s.  A source to back up this claim as a reason should be provided.|date=August 2019}}\n\nNot until the fall of 1965 did color broadcasts play a major role at CBS and ABC, at which time half the network shows from ABC and CBS were being made and shown in color. Meanwhile, all but two NBC prime time shows were in color and most of NBC's daytime shows were. By the fall of 1966, all three networks produced all of their prime time shows in color. By the time the movie went to NBC in 1968, all network shows (except for reruns of black and white movies) were in color.\n\n===Later hosts===\n{{More citations needed|section, except for one footnote, |date=June 2013}}\nPartly because commercial time during programs increased beginning in the late 1960s, the idea of regularly having hosts to introduce the film was dropped when ''The Wizard of Oz'' went to [[NBC]] in 1968, where no \"wraparound\" sequence was shown. The presentation consisted only of the film itself, with its original opening and closing credits, and no special NBC-created credits or hosting segments. The famous [[NBC peacock]] was shown immediately prior to the beginning of the film, with announcer [[Mel Brandt]] saying that \"the first 22 minutes of this program [i.e. the Kansas and tornado sequences] will be shown in black-and-white\", a not quite accurate statement, since the final three minutes of the film also took place in Kansas, and were at that time also shown in black-and-white, rather than in the [[sepia tone]] in which they originally had been made (the sepia was not restored to the Kansas and tornado scenes until 1989, the film's 50th anniversary). However, one NBC telecast featured an on-screen host: the 1970 showing, which opened with veteran actor [[Gregory Peck]] paying tribute to the recently deceased Judy Garland (a segment directed by ''Oz'' producer [[Mervyn LeRoy]], marking his first TV work), although this segment consisted of only a few brief remarks, while the opening hosting segments on CBS had gone on for about three minutes or so. The NBC ''Oz'' telecasts began the tradition of the film's annual showings during the [[Easter]] and [[Passover]] seasons of the year as opposed to the winter showings on [[CBS]].\n\nThe switch in networks resulted because CBS was unwilling to meet MGM's increased price \u2014 fostered by the film's ever increasing popularity \u2014 for renewal of the rights to telecast it.<ref>Fricke, John, and Jay Scarfone and William Stillman. \"The Wizard of Oz: The Official 50th Anniversary Pictorial History\", Warner Books, 1989.</ref>  The film stayed on NBC until 1976. When CBS, realizing its error in allowing it to go to another network, bought back the rights at MGM's asking price, their viewer ratings shot up, and one executive was heard to remark, \"That picture is better [for the network] than a gushing oil well\".<ref>http://www.docstoc.com/docs/8043642/New-book-sell-sheet</ref>\n\nAfter its 1976 return to CBS, the film was hosted on that network only once more, in a filmed segment featuring Angela Lansbury in 1990, but the CBS \"wraparound\" opening and closing credits were not - and have never been - revived, although, during those years, a blue card featuring a painting of a rainbow and the title '''The Wizard of Oz''' ''was'' shown on the screen while the night's pre-empted programs or programs to be shown at regular time and the sponsors were being announced, and immediately before and after commercial breaks. In the 1980s clips from the film shown on a red background with title was shown at the start, while a still of Emerald City with title was used during commercials. Angela Lansbury also narrated a documentary about the making of the film, originally entitled ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: 50 Years of Magic'' and years later re-titled ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: The Making of a Movie Classic''. It was first shown immediately after the movie's 1990 telecast, and is included as a supplement on all the DVD releases beginning with the 1999 DVD release. [[Jack Haley, Jr.]], the documentary's director, was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for his work.\n\nWhen shown on Turner Classic Movies, ''The Wizard of Oz'' was usually hosted by TCM host [[Robert Osborne]].\n\nOn June 3, 2007, [[Tom Kenny]], the voice of [[SpongeBob SquarePants]], hosted a telecast of the film on Turner Classic Movies, as part of ''Essentials, Jr.'', a special summer series of family movies.\n\nOn July 27, 2008, the film was shown twice in a row on [[Turner Network Television]] without a host, but with commercials, and with \"pop-up\" animated ads for other TNT programs at the bottom of the screen just before and after commercial breaks.\n\nOn March 24 and 25, 2012, the film was hosted on Cartoon Network by television actor [[Robert Wu]], who provides the voice of Mr. Washee Washee in the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode, \"[[Tiegs for Two]]\". This telecast ran two-and-a-half hours, longer than any CBS or NBC telecasts.\n\nOn June 10, 2012, which would have been Judy Garland's 90th birthday, the film was telecast on Turner Classic Movies without commercials, and hosted by comedian [[Bill Hader]], again as part of the ''Essentials, Jr.'' summer series of family films. Unlike the CBS hosting segments which were a part of the 1960s telecasts of the film, Hader's segment showed clips from the film before it actually began.\n\n===Sponsorship===\nBeing a presentation of network TV, ''The Wizard of Oz'' was subject to sponsorship from a variety of advertisers.\n\nThe first telecast of \"Oz\" was a presentation of [[Ford Star Jubilee]] and thus sponsored by [[Ford Motor Company]] and its dealers. In the ensuing years of 1959 thru 1967, the yearly telecast was sponsored by one primary sponsor with a co-sponsor. Perhaps the best remembered examples were the telecasts sponsored by [[Procter and Gamble]] and promoted when the company gave free premiums of hand puppets with packages of some of its most popular products. Many also remember the 1970 telecast presented on NBC by [[Singer Manufacturing Company]] as a tribute to Judy Garland, who had died in June 1969.\n\nIn later years, several different advertisers shared sponsorship; no one advertiser predominated.\n\n===Television ratings===\nThe showing in 1983 was the 25th network prime-time showing, a record then for any film or television special.  In the first nine showings, all on CBS, ''The Wizard of Oz'' gained at least 49% of the television audience.<ref>Harmetz, Aljean \"'Wizard of Oz': A TV Success Story,\" ''New York Times'', March 16, 1983. pg.

When CBS bought the film back from NBC in 1976, it again began to beat episodes of Disney in the ratings. It preempted Disney on one more occasion, after the series moved to that network in the early 1980s.<ref>http://getty.net/texts/tv-67-83.txt</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the first year it was shown on TV in [[high-definition television|high-definition]], the film placed No. 11 in the Nielsen ratings among cable television programs for the week of November 11.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wrestlingclique.com/entertainment/14907-extended-nielsen-ratings-nov-6-12-a.html|title=Extended Nielsen Ratings for Nov 6-12|website=wrestlingclique.com|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Changes made in running time===\nFrom 1968 to 1984, minor cuts were made to the film to make room for added commercial time and in order to have the film \"clock in\" at two hours. No dialogue or singing was removed, only moments such as camera pans and establishing shots, as well as MGM's written [[foreword]] to the film.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nOn a few occasions beginning in 1985, again because of the increased time spent on commercial breaks, the film was time-compressed to fit it into a two-hour running time without cutting it.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> However, ''The Wizard of Oz'' is now always shown complete and at its regular speed on television, both with and without commercials. When shown with ads, the film now runs about two hours and fifteen minutes, simply because of the increase in commercial time.\n\n===March 1991 showing===\nThe March 1991 showing was the first after the film gained protected status from the [[Library of Congress]] and the [[National Film Preservation Board]]. Networks opted to no longer shorten the film by \"microcutting\" a few individual moments throughout the movie as had been done from the late 1960s to the early 1980s to make room for commercials and keep it in a two-hour broadcast. This extended the running time of the film from 8 P.M to 10:07&nbsp;p.m. and sometimes even longer, depending on the amount of time spent on commercials. It was one of the first 50 films selected for this protection.<ref>Glenn Collins, \"A Full-Length 'Oz' for TV.\" ''New York Times''. New York, N.Y.: March 19, 1991, p.

Because both films were still licensed to CBS, Turner and the network negotiated a deal that extended CBS' license for ''Oz'' in exchange for relinquishing its rights to ''Gone with the Wind''.<ref name=TCMnotes>{{cite web | url = http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/852/The-Wizard-of-Oz/notes.html | title= ''The Wizard of Oz'' (1939): Notes | publisher = [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]] | accessdate= 2014-02-08}}</ref> In 1991, the film was shown twice during the year for the first time.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} 1991 also marked the first time since 1956 that the film was shown in November. This also happened in 1993, when the film was telecast in both February and November of that year. The film was not shown on television at all in 1992, 1995 and 1997, marking the first time since 1963 that a year was skipped in showings of the film. Turner, which owned most of the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television library at the time (later owned by Warner Bros.), began moving to make its properties exclusive to Turner-owned outlets in the late 1990s; as such, in 1998, ''The Wizard of Oz'' made its last appearance on CBS, moving exclusively to Turner-owned properties the next year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1998/tv/news/wizard-travels-to-tbs-1117469508/|title=\u2018Wizard\u2019 travels to TBS|last=Kissell|first=Rick|date=1998-04-06|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-30}}</ref>\n\n2000 marked the first time that the film was shown on U.S. television during the summer. In 2002, it was shown five times.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nOn November 6, 2011, [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]] became the American television channel on which ''The Wizard of Oz'' has been shown most often, when the film had its 32nd showing on that channel, finally breaking CBS' record 31 showings. As of April 29, 2013, Turner Classic Movies has shown the film 23 times.\n\n===Differences between network and cable showings===\nIn addition to the frequent cable showings, another difference between showings on NBC, CBS, the WB network, and cable channels is that when the film was shown on CBS and NBC, it was always presented as a special instead of just a televised film. From 1959 until it went to cable, the film was never shown on [[NBC Saturday Night at the Movies]] or any other movie anthology series, and telecasts of the film regularly preempted two hours or more of regular television programming.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nPromos for the CBS and NBC showings during the 1960s began airing on television as much as two weeks in advance of that year's telecast and were still airing as late as 1989.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}  On the major commercial networks, it was never termed a \"CBS Movie Special\" or an \"NBC Movie Special\", as movie specials shown on those networks are frequently termed, but as simply ''The Wizard of Oz''.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n===Aspect ratio===\nThe 1955 and 1998 theatrical re-releases were matted in movie theaters to produce a widescreen effect for the [[Aspect ratio (image)#Cinema terminology|Academy-standard]] [[aspect-ratio]] film.\n\nWhen shown in [[HDTV]], the film is [[pillarbox]]ed so that its aspect ratio is preserved.<ref>http://www.dtvforum.info/index.php?showtopic=43204</ref> On DVD, the film has always been issued in its original 1939 aspect ratio.<ref name=\"dvdtalk.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/39772/wizard-of-oz-the/|title=The Wizard of Oz (Blu-ray)|website=DVD Talk|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"dvdtalk.com\"/><ref>http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/wizardozse.php</ref>\n\n==Outside the United States==\nThe movie has also been shown on television successfully in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]] and is shown every year in [[Australia]], but it has not become the television phenomenon there that it has in the U.S.<ref>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Website</ref> In Indonesia, the film was aired for the first time on the newly-inaugurated television network [[RCTI]] in November 1989, with reruns on other four networks in the 1990s.

It was shown in color although very few people owned color TV sets. This marked the only time it was ever aired that late on a non-cable television network (Turner Broadcasting frequently schedules two showings in a row on the same night, at 8:00 p.m. and 10:15 p.m.). Future showings began earlier in order to allow children to see it more easily. In addition, the prime time hour generally given to affiliates for local programming was taken back in order to run the movie early. This practice continued until the film was sold to NBC.\n*1959 - CBS - Sunday, December 13 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n::The first of the film's annual showings.

Kennedy]]'s assassination, others say room needed to be made for more Christmas themed specials and that the movie fit in better during January. For whatever reason, the movie continued to air early in the year rather than late in the year from 1964 until the 1990s.\n*1965 - CBS - Sunday, January 17 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1966 - CBS - Sunday, January 9 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1967 - CBS - Sunday, February 12 - 6:00&nbsp;p.m.\nLast airing on CBS until 1976.

The first time that the film was shown at 7:00 P.M instead of 6:00 P.M.\n*1969 - NBC - Sunday, March 9 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1970 - NBC - Sunday, March 15 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1971 - NBC - Sunday, April 18 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1972 - NBC - Tuesday, March 7 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\nThe first time that the film aired in the middle of the week, rather than on a weekend.\n*1973 - NBC - Sunday, April 8 - 7:00 \n*1974 - NBC - Sunday, February 24 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Due to a breaking news story, NBC decided to show the film two weeks later, on March 10, rather than show it too late or in progress.\n*1975 - NBC - Easter Sunday, March 30 - 7:00&nbsp;p.m.\n*1976 - CBS - Sunday, March 14 - 7 p.m.\nThe year that ''The Wizard Of Oz'' returned to CBS. It remained there for twenty-two more years, a likely record in those years for a film's consecutive showings on one network. Initially the movie aired late winter/early spring, but beginning in 1991, the movie moved back and forth from spring to late fall. Another change was that CBS no longer began the movie before normal prime time. Before 1976, when run on a day other than Sunday, NBC took back the 7 p.m. Eastern / 6 p.m. Central time slots from affiliates to run the movie early enough so children could see it before bedtime. Also, prior to 1968, CBS always took the 6 p.m. hour to run the movie early. Logic was that times have changed and children now stay up a little later than they did in the past. From then on, if shown in a Sunday 6 to 8 or 7 to 9 pm time slot on CBS, the film preempted ''60 Minutes'', so beginning in 1978, CBS executives moved the showings to other nights of the week. If the film was shown on a Sunday, CBS usually scheduled it at 8 pm, so that it did not conflict with ''60 Minutes''. (As of 2017, ''60 Minutes'' continues to air in the same Sunday 7 p.m. time slot on CBS.)\n*1977 - CBS - Sunday, March 20 - 7 p.m.\n*1978 - CBS - Easter Sunday, March 26 - 7 p.m.\n*1979 - CBS - Friday, March 23 - 8 p.m.\n*1980 - CBS - Friday, March 7 - 8 p.m.\n*1981 - CBS - Friday, February 27 - 8 p.m.\n*1982 - CBS - Saturday, March 27 - 8 p.m.\n*1983 - CBS - Friday, March 18 - 8 p.m.\n*1984 - CBS - Friday, March 30 - 8 p.m.\n*1985 - CBS - Friday, March 1 - 8 p.m.\n*1986 - CBS - Saturday, February 15 - 8 p.m.\n*1987 - CBS - Friday, March 6 - 8 p.m.\n*1988 - CBS - Wednesday, February 24 - 8:30&nbsp;p.m.\nDelayed due to a CBS News Special report.\n*1989 - CBS - Sunday, March 18 - 8 p.m.\n*1990 - CBS - Tuesday, February 20 - 8 p.m.\n*1991 - CBS - Tuesday, March 19 - 8 p.m.\nSoundtrack remastered in stereo using CBS StereoSound system.\n*1991 - CBS - Wednesday, November 27 - 8 p.m.\nThe first time the film aired twice in the same year.
