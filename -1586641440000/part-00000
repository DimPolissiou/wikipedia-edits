1194\u20131195, when he was planning to receive the title of [[king]], he instituted [[Full communion|a union]] of the [[Holy See of Cilicia|Armenian church]] with [[Pope|Rome]].<ref

in the Church of Holy Wisdom at [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]].<ref name='Ghazarian'/> His accession to the throne of Cilicia as its first Armenian monarch heralded into reality not merely an official end to Cilicia's shadowy umbilical connection to the [[Byzantine Empire]], but also a new era of ecclesiastical co-operation with the West.<ref name='Ghazarian'/> A skilled diplomat and wise politician, Leo established useful alliances with many of the contemporary rulers; he also gained the friendship and support of the [[Hospitallers]] and the [[Teutonic Knights]] by granting considerable territories to them.<ref name='Nersessian'/><ref name='Edwards'/>\n\nHe envisioned annexing the [[Principality of Antioch]] to his kingdom, thus reinforcing his authority along much of the northeastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coastline.<ref name='Ghazarian'/> Levon first put this plan into action in 1194 by seizing the strategic fortress of [[Baghras]] after [[Saladin]], the Sultan of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]],<ref name='Runciman'/> had abandoned it.<ref name='Ghazarian'/> His greatest triumph was achieved at the beginning of 1216 when at the head of his army he occupied [[Antioch]] and installed his grandnephew, [[Raymond-Roupen, Prince of Antioch|Raymond-Roupen]] as its head.<ref name='Ghazarian'/> Raymond-Roupen remained in power until Leo's death.<ref name='Ghazarian'/> The transforming of the Armenian [[Royal Household|court]], following the pattern of the Frankish courts, proceeded at a more rapid pace after Leo came to power.<ref name='Nersessian'/> Many of the old names of specific functions or the titles of dignitaries were replaced by [[Latin]] ones and the changes in nomenclature were often accompanied by changes in the character of these offices.<ref name='Nersessian'/>\n\nCommerce was greatly developed during the reign of Leo:<ref name='Nersessian'/> he granted charters regarding trade and commercial [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]]s to [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]].<ref name='Ghazarian'/> These [[charters]] provided their holders with special [[tax exemption]]s in exchange for their merchandising trade.<ref name='Ghazarian'/> They encouraged the establishment of [[Italians|Italian]] merchant communities in Tarsus, [[Adana]] and [[Mamistra]], and became a large source of revenue for the growth and development of Cilician Armenia.<ref name='Ghazarian'/>\n\n==Early years==\nHe was the younger son of [[Stephen of Armenia|Stephen]], the third son of [[Leo I, Prince of Armenia|Leo I, lord of Armenian Cilicia]].<ref name='Cawley'/> His mother was [[Rita of Barbaron|Rita]], a daughter of [[Lords of Barbaron|Sempad, Lord of Barbaron]].<ref name='Cawley'/> Leo's father, who was on his way to attend a banquet given by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] governor of [[Cilicia]], [[Andronicus Euphorbenus]],<ref name='Ghazarian'/> was murdered<ref name='Runciman'/> on  7 February 1165.<ref name='Cawley'/> Following their father's death, Leo and his elder brother Roupen lived with their maternal uncle, [[Lords of Barbaron|Pagouran]], lord of the fortress of [[Barbaron]], protecting the [[Cilician Gates]] pass in the [[Taurus Mountains]].<ref name='Ghazarian'/><ref name='Edwards'/>\n\nTheir paternal uncle, [[Mleh, Prince of Armenia|Mleh I, lord of Armenian Cilicia]] had made a host of enemies by his cruelties in his country, resulting in his assassination by his own soldiers in [[Kozan, Adana|the city of Sis]] in 1175.<ref name='Kurkjian'/> The seigneurs of Cilician Armenia elected Leo's brother, Roupen III to occupy the throne of the principality.<ref name='Kurkjian'/> In 1183, [[Hethum III of Lampron]], allied with Prince [[Bohemond III of Antioch]], began joint hostilities against Roupen III<ref name='Ghazarian'/> who sent Leo to surround

to Cilicia's shadowy umbilical connection to the [[Byzantine Empire]], but also a new era of ecclesiastical co-operation with the West.<ref name='Ghazarian'/> A skilled diplomat and wise politician, Leo established useful alliances with many of the contemporary rulers; he also gained the friendship and support of the [[Hospitallers]] and the [[Teutonic Knights]] by granting considerable

Sultan of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]],<ref name='Runciman'/> had abandoned it.<ref name='Ghazarian'/> His greatest triumph was achieved at the beginning of 1216 when at the head of his army he occupied [[Antioch]] and installed his grandnephew, [[Raymond-Roupen, Prince of Antioch|Raymond-Roupen]] as its head.<ref name='Ghazarian'/> Raymond-Roupen remained in power until Leo's death.<ref

opportunity to put his sharp political skills to practice as the interim guardian of the [[Rubenids|Roupenian House]].<ref name='Ghazarian'/> Roupen's release required payment of a large ransom, and the submission of Adana and Mamistra as vassalages to Antioch.<ref name='Ghazarian'/> When Roupen returned from the captivity, he transferred the power to his brother, Leo (1187) and retired to the monastery of Trazarg.<ref name='Nersessian'/>\n\n==His rule==\n\n===Prince of Cilicia===\nThe menace of the recent alliance between the Byzantine Emperor [[Isaac II Angelos]] and [[Saladin]], and the

Isauria.<ref name='Nersessian'/> Though we find no specific mention of it, Seleucia must have been captured about this time.<ref name='Nersessian'/> Proceeding northwards, Leo seized Heraclea, gave it up after payment to him a large sum, and advanced as far as Caesarea.<ref name='Nersessian'/>\n\n{{Quote|Leo was a valiant and learned prince; he enlarged his principality and became the master of

A few days only after his taking possession of the country, [[Ishmaelites|the descendants of Ismael]], under the command of one Roustam, advanced and came against Cilicia.

Roustam himself being killed by [[St. George]], the whole [[Hagarenes|Hagarenian]] army then fled and dispersed; the Armenians pursued them and enriched themselves by the booty. The power of Leo thus increased, and being confident in his strength, he chased the Tadjiks [name used by Armenian chroniclers to designate the Saracens, particularly the Seljuks] and pursued the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]]; he conquered Isauria and came as far as [[Iconium]]; he captured [[Heraclea Cybistra|Heraclea]], and again gave it up for a large ransom; he blockaded [[Kayseri|Caesarea]], and had nearly taken it; he made a treaty with the [[Sultanate of R\u00fbm|Sultan of Iconium]], and received a large sum of money from him;

It is remembered for the controversial last play, dubbed the \"[[Fail Mary]]\". Replacement officials were being used due to the [[2012 NFL referee lockout]]. With the Packers leading 12\u20137 and only eight seconds left, Seattle quarterback [[Russell Wilson]] threw a desperation [[Hail Mary]] pass into the end zone. Packers [[Safety (American and Canadian football position)|safety]] [[M. D. Jennings]] and Seahawks [[wide receiver]] [[Golden Tate]] both jumped for the ball, and both maintained some contact with it in the air and upon landing on the ground. The two officials near the play conferred and then simultaneously made separate signals; [[Official (American football)#Side judge|side judge]] Lance Easley raised his arms to signal [[touchdown]], while [[back judge]] Derrick Rhone-Dunn waved his arms to signal stoppage of the clock. Eventually, it was declared a touchdown, with Jennings and Tate ruled to have simultaneous possession (which is decided in favor of the offensive player), giving the Seahawks the win. The play was controversial on two counts. Following the game, the NFL released an official statement that acknowledged that a [[pass interference]] penalty should have been called on Tate. Also, several of the regular NFL officials stated they would have ruled it an interception. This incident helped end the lockout.\n* The teams clashed in the conference finals of the [[2014\u201315 NFL playoffs]]. Seattle was looking to repeat as Super Bowl champions, having crushed the [[Denver Broncos]] in [[Super Bowl XLVII]] 43\u20138 the year before. However, Russell Wilson started poorly and his team was down 16\u20130 at halftime and 19\u20137 with under three minutes left. Wilson began the rally by first running for a touchdown. Then, after a successful [[onside kick]], [[Marshawn Lynch]] rushed for another touchdown, giving his team its first lead. Ahead 20\u201319, the Seahawks elected to go for a [[two-point conversion]]; Wilson came under intense pressure and was chased out of the pocket, but managed to loft a high, arcing pass to tight end [[Luke Willson]], who took the ball into the end zone. That successful conversion proved to be crucial, as Packers quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]] had enough time to drive down the field for a tying field goal. In overtime, Seattle won the coin toss, and Wilson threw a game-winning touchdown pass to [[Jermaine Kearse]] on the first possession.\n\nThe teams have met four times in the playoffs, with the Packers winning three.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sea/playoffs.htm | title = Seattle Seahawks Playoff History | publisher = Sports Reference LLC | access-date = March 13, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190925204240/https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sea/playoffs.htm | archive-date = September 25, 2019 | url-status = live }}</ref> In addition to the two meetings cited above, Green Bay won 42\u201320 in [[2007\u201308 NFL playoffs|2007\u201308]] and 28\u201323 in the [[2019\u201320 NFL playoffs|2019\u201320]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.si.com/nfl/2020/01/13/packers-beat-seahawks-advance-to-nfc-championship |title=Packers Leaving it All on the Field, Win After Win |last=Kahler |first=Kalyn |date=2020-01-13 |website=Sports Illustrated |language=en-us |access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> both in the Divisional round.\n\n==Results==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2020}}\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible\" style=\"width:90%; clear:both; margin:1.5em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Oakland Raiders}};\" |  Green Bay Packers vs. Seattle Seahawks Season-by-Season Results\n|- value=\"top\"\n|<div class=\"NavFrame\">\n<div class=\"NavHead\" style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Oakland Raiders}};\">1970s \u2013 1990s (Tied, 4\u20134)</div>\n<div class=\"NavContent\" \nstyle=\"text-align:center; display:none;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!

Their Wild Card matchup saw numerous lead changes, and the teams were tied 27\u201327 at the end of regulation time. In overtime, the Seahawks won the coin toss. Seahawks quarterback [[Matt Hasselbeck]] (a former Packer) told the microphoned referee, and thus the crowd and the national television audience, \"We want the ball, and we're gonna score.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000769793/article/remembering-matt-hasselbecks-coinflip-guarantee | title = Remembering Matt Hasselbeck's coin-flip guarantee | first = Dan | last = Hanzus | date = January 4, 2017 | publisher = National Football League | access-date = March 13, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200308012259/http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000769793/article/remembering-matt-hasselbecks-coinflip-guarantee | archive-date = March 8, 2020 | url-status = live }}</ref> After each team went three-and-out, [[Al Harris (cornerback)|Al Harris]] intercepted Hasselbeck's pass and returned it 52 yards for the winning touchdown.\n* On September 24, 2012, the teams played a regular season game at the Seahawks' [[CenturyLink Field]]. It is remembered for the controversial last play, dubbed the \"[[Fail Mary]]\". Replacement officials were being used due to the [[2012 NFL referee lockout]]. With the Packers leading 12\u20137 and only eight seconds left, Seattle quarterback [[Russell Wilson]] threw a desperation [[Hail Mary]] pass into the end zone. Packers [[Safety (American and Canadian football position)|safety]] [[M. D. Jennings]] and Seahawks [[wide receiver]] [[Golden Tate]] both jumped for the ball, and both maintained some contact with it in the air and upon landing on the ground. The two officials near the play conferred and then simultaneously made separate signals; [[Official (American football)#Side judge|side judge]] Lance Easley raised his arms to signal [[touchdown]], while [[back judge]] Derrick Rhone-Dunn waved his arms to signal stoppage of the clock. Eventually, it was declared a touchdown, with Jennings and Tate ruled to have simultaneous possession (which is decided in favor of the offensive player), giving the Seahawks the win. The play was controversial on two counts. Following the game, the NFL released an official statement that acknowledged that a [[pass interference]] penalty should have been called on Tate. Also, several of the regular NFL officials stated they would have ruled it an interception. This incident helped end the lockout.\n* The teams clashed in the conference finals of the [[2014\u201315 NFL playoffs]]. Seattle was looking to repeat as Super Bowl champions, having crushed the [[Denver Broncos]] in [[Super Bowl XLVII]] 43\u20138 the year before. However, Russell Wilson started poorly and his team was down 16\u20130 at halftime and 19\u20137 with under three minutes left. Wilson began the rally by first running for a touchdown. Then, after a successful [[onside kick]], [[Marshawn Lynch]] rushed for another touchdown, giving his team its first lead. Ahead 20\u201319, the Seahawks elected to go for a [[two-point conversion]]; Wilson came under intense pressure and was chased out of the pocket, but managed to loft a high, arcing pass to tight end [[Luke Willson]], who took the ball into the end zone. That successful conversion proved to be crucial, as Packers quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]] had enough time to drive down the field for a tying field goal. In overtime, Seattle won the coin toss, and Wilson threw a game-winning touchdown pass to [[Jermaine Kearse]] on the first possession.\n\nThe teams have met four times in the playoffs, with the Packers winning three.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sea/playoffs.htm | title = Seattle Seahawks Playoff History | publisher = Sports Reference LLC | access-date = March 13, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190925204240/https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sea/playoffs.htm | archive-date = September 25, 2019 | url-status = live }}</ref> In addition to the two meetings cited above, Green Bay won 42\u201320 in [[2007\u201308 NFL playoffs|2007\u201308]] and 28\u201323 in the [[2019\u201320 NFL playoffs|2019\u201320]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.si.com/nfl/2020/01/13/packers-beat-seahawks-advance-to-nfc-championship |title=Packers Leaving it All on the Field, Win After Win |last=Kahler |first=Kalyn |date=2020-01-13 |website=Sports Illustrated |language=en-us |access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> both in the Divisional round.\n\n==Results==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2020}}\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible\" style=\"width:90%; clear:both; margin:1.5em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Oakland Raiders}};\" |  Green Bay Packers vs. Seattle Seahawks Season-by-Season Results\n|- value=\"top\"\n|<div class=\"NavFrame\">\n<div class=\"NavHead\" style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Oakland Raiders}};\">1970s \u2013 1990s (Tied, 4\u20134)</div>\n<div class=\"NavContent\" \nstyle=\"text-align:center; display:none;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!

Mobilization is the process by which progenitors are made to migrate from the bone marrow into the bloodstream, thus increasing their numbers in the blood. Mobilization is used clinically as a source of hematopoietic stem cells for [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]] (HSCT). Signaling through KIT has been implicated in mobilization. At the current time, [[G-CSF]] is the main drug used for mobilization; it indirectly activates KIT. [[Plerixafor]] (an antagonist of [[CXCR4-SDF1]]) in combination with G-CSF, is also being used for mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells.

At the onset of the Second World War, the Fleet Air Arm consisted of 20 squadrons with only 232 frontline aircraft, and 191 additional trainers. By the end of the war the strength of the Fleet Air Arm was 59 aircraft carriers, 3,700 aircraft, 72,000 officers and men and 56 Naval air stations.\n\nDuring the war, the FAA operated fighters, torpedo bombers and reconnaissance aircraft. Following the [[Dunkirk evacuation]] and the commencement of the [[Battle of Britain]], the [[Royal Air Force]] soon found itself critically short of fighter pilots. In the summer of 1940, the RAF had just over 800 fighter pilots and as personnel shortages worsened; the RAF turned to the Admiralty to ask for help from the Fleet Air Arm. Fleet Air Arm crews under [[RAF Fighter Command]] were either seconded individually to RAF fighter squadrons or entire as with 804 and 808 Naval Air Squadrons. The former provided dockyard defence during the Battle of Britain with [[Gloster Gladiator|Sea Gladiators]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fleetairarmarchive.net/RollofHonour/Battlehonour_crewlists/BattleofBritain_FAAaircrew_1940.html |title=Fleet Air Arm squadrons taking part in the Battle of Britain under RAF Fighter Command |work=Fleet Air Arm Archive 1939-1945 |accessdate=8 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150625093132/http://www.fleetairarmarchive.net/RollofHonour/Battlehonour_crewlists/BattleofBritain_FAAaircrew_1940.html |archive-date=25 June 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn British home waters and out into the [[Atlantic Ocean]], operations against Axis shipping and submarines in support of the RN were mounted by [[RAF Coastal Command]] with large patrol bombers, flying boats and land-based fighter-bombers. The [[aircraft carrier]] had replaced the [[battleship]] as the [[capital ship]] of the RN and its aircraft were now its principal offensive weapons. The top scoring [[Flying ace|fighter ace]] with 17 victories was Commander [[Stanley Orr]], the [[Royal Marines|Royal Marine]] ace was [[Ronald Cuthbert Hay]] with 13 victories. A number of Royal Marines were [[History of the Royal Marines#Second World War|FAA pilots]] during the war.\n\nNotable Fleet Air Arm operations during the war included the [[Battle of Taranto]], the sinking of the [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']], [[Operation Tungsten]] against the [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']] and [[Operation Meridian]] against oil plants in [[Sumatra]].\n\n===Post-war history===\n[[File:SeaFury launch.jpg|thumb|right|Hawker Sea Fury of No. 804 Squadron launched off {{HMS|Glory|R62|6}} during the Korean War, June 1951]]\n[[File:Phantom FG1 892 Sqn on HMS Ark Royal (R09) 1972.jpg|thumb|right|Phantom FG.1 of 892 NAS aboard {{HMS|Ark Royal|R09|6}} in 1972]]\n[[File:DN-SC-87-05770.JPEG|thumb|right|Two [[British Aerospace Sea Harrier|Sea Harriers]] from [[800 Naval Air Squadron]] approach the flight deck of [[U.S. Navy]] aircraft carrier {{USS|Dwight D. Eisenhower||6}} in 1984]]\nAfter the war the FAA needed to fly [[jet aircraft]] from their carriers. The jet aircraft of the era were considerably less effective at low speeds than propeller aircraft, but propeller aircraft could not effectively fight jets at the high speeds flown by jet aircraft. The FAA took on its first jet, the [[De Havilland Vampire|Sea Vampire]], in the late 1940s. The Sea Vampire was the first jet credited with taking off and landing on a carrier. The Air Arm continued with high-powered prop aircraft alongside the new jets resulting in the FAA being woefully outpowered during the [[Korean War]]. Nevertheless, jets were not yet wholly superior to propeller aircraft and a flight of ground attack [[Hawker Sea Fury|Hawker Sea Furies]] downed a [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] and damaged others in an engagement.\n\nAs jets became larger, more powerful and faster they required more space to take off and land. The [[US Navy]] simply built much larger carriers. The Royal Navy had a few large carriers built and completed after the end of the war but another solution was sought. This was partly overcome by the introduction of a Royal Navy idea to [[flight deck#Angled flight deck|angle the flight deck]] away from the centre line so that the aircraft landing had a clear run away from the usual forward deck park. An associated British invention, intended to provide more precise optical guidance to aircraft on final approaching the deck, was the [[Optical Landing System#Fresnel Lens Optical Landing System (FLOLS)|Fresnel lens optical landing aid]]. Another Royal Navy invention was the use of a [[steam catapult|steam-powered catapult]] to cater for the larger and heavier aircraft (both systems were adopted by the US Navy).\n\nDefence cuts across the British armed forces [[1966 Defence White Paper|during the 1960s and 1970s]] led to the withdrawal of existing Royal Navy aircraft carriers, transfer of Fleet Air Arm fixed-wing jet strike aircraft such as the [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4K (FG.1) Phantom II]] and [[Blackburn Buccaneer|Buccaneer S.2]] to the Royal Air Force, and cancellation of large replacement aircraft carriers, including the [[CVA-01]] design. The last conventional carrier to be retired was {{HMS|Ark Royal|R09|6}} in 1978.<ref>Manning, p. 149</ref> Although HMS ''Hermes'' was converted in 1980/81 to a STOVL carrier to operate Sea Harriers, a ramp was fitted to aid take-off. A new series of small carriers, the [[Invincible class aircraft carrier|''Invincible'' class]] anti-submarine warfare ships (known as \"through deck cruisers\") were built and equipped with the [[BAE Sea Harrier|Sea Harrier]] a derivative of the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier]] [[VTOL]] aircraft. These carriers incorporated an upswept forward section of the flight deck that deflected the aircraft upward on launch and permitted heavier loads to be carried by the Harrier, for example in weaponry, and the system was used extensively in the Falklands War, with both ''Hermes'' and ''Invincible'' part of the Task Force.\nAt the end of the [[Cold War]] in 1989 the Fleet Air Arm was under the command of the [[Flag Officer Naval Air Command]], a [[Rear admiral (Royal Navy)|rear admiral]] based at [[RNAS Yeovilton]].\n* '''[[Flag Officer Naval Air Command]]''' (FONAC), at [[RNAS Yeovilton]]\n** '''[[RNAS Prestwick]]''':\n*** [[819 Naval Air Squadron]], ([[Anti-submarine warfare|Anti-submarine]], 12\u00d7 [[Westland Sea King|Sea King HAS.5]])\n*** [[826 Naval Air Squadron]], (Anti-submarine, 12\u00d7 Sea King HAS.6)\n*** [[HMS Gannet SAR Flight]], ([[Search and Rescue|Search & Rescue]], 8\u00d7 [[Westland Sea King|Sea King HU.5]])\n** '''[[RNAS Yeovilton]]''':\n*** [[707 Naval Air Squadron]], ([[Air Assault]], 10\u00d7 [[Westland Sea King|Sea King HC.4]])\n*** [[800 Naval Air Squadron]], (12\u00d7 [[British Aerospace Sea Harrier|Sea Harrier FA.2]])\n*** [[801 Naval Air Squadron]], (12\u00d7 Sea Harrier FA.2)\n*** [[845 Naval Air Squadron]], (Air Assault, 10\u00d7 Sea King HC.4)\n*** [[846 Naval Air Squadron]], (Air Assault, 10\u00d7 Sea King HC.4)\n*** [[899 Naval Air Squadron]], (Training, 24\u00d7 Sea Harrier FA.2)\n*** [[Fleet Requirements and Aircraft Direction Unit]], (Aggressor Squadron, [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra TT.18]], [[Hawker Hunter|Hawker Hunter GA.11]])\n** '''[[RNAS Culdrose (HMS Seahawk)|RNAS Culdrose]]''':\n*** [[705 Naval Air Squadron]], (Basic Helicopter Training, 38\u00d7 [[A\u00e9rospatiale Gazelle|Gazelle HT.2]])\n*** [[706 Naval Air Squadron]], (Sea King Training, 12\u00d7 various types of Sea King)\n*** [[750 Naval Air Squadron]], (Observer Training, [[Handley Page Jetstream|Jetstream T2]])\n*** [[771 Naval Air Squadron]], (Search & Rescue, 12\u00d7 [[Westland Sea King|Sea King HU.5]])\n*** [[814 Naval Air Squadron]], (Anti-submarine, 12\u00d7 Sea King HAS.5)\n*** [[820 Naval Air Squadron]], (Anti-submarine, 12\u00d7 Sea King HAS.6)\n*** [[824 Naval Air Squadron]], (Anti-submarine, 12\u00d7 Sea King HAS.6) (disbanded August 1989)\n*** [[849 Naval Air Squadron]], ([[Airborne early warning and control]], 10\u00d7 Sea King AEW.2A, 4\u00d7 Sea King AEW.5)\n** '''[[RNAS Portland (HMS Osprey)|RNAS Portland]]''':\n*** [[702 Naval Air Squadron]], (Aircrew & Maintenance Training, 24\u00d7 [[Westland Lynx|Lynx HAS.3S]])\n*** [[772 Naval Air Squadron]], (Air Assault, 10\u00d7 Sea King HC.4)\n*** [[810 Naval Air Squadron]], (Anti-submarine, 12\u00d7 Sea King HAS.6)\n*** [[815 Naval Air Squadron]], (Frigate & Destroyer Helicopters, 32\u00d7 Lynx HAS.3S, most deployed on frigates and destroyers at sea)\n*** [[829 Naval Air Squadron]], (Frigate & Destroyer Helicopters, 32\u00d7 Lynx HAS.3S, most deployed on frigates and destroyers at sea)\n\n==== Fleet Air Arm Inventory 1989 ====\nThe inventory of the Fleet Air Arm in 1989 consisted of the following aircraft:<ref name=\"World's Air Forces 1989\">{{cite journal|title=World's Air Forces 1989|journal=Flight International|date=29 November 1989|pages=61\u201362|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1989/1989%20-%203700.html|accessdate=19 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201034011/https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1989/1989%20-%203700.html|archive-date=1 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* '''Combat aircraft''':\n** 42\u00d7 [[British Aerospace Sea Harrier|Sea Harrier FRS.1/F(A).2]]\n** 2x/2\u00d7 [[British Aerospace Sea Harrier|Sea Harrier T.4A/T.4N]]\n* '''Helicopters''':\n** 60+ [[Westland Sea King|Sea King HAS.5]]\n** 31+ [[Westland Sea King|Sea King HAS.6]]\n** 10\u00d7 [[Westland Sea King|Sea King AEW.2A]]\n** 33\u00d7 [[Westland Sea King|Sea King HC.4]]\n** 80+ [[Westland Lynx|Lynx HAS.3S]]\n** 23\u00d7/8\u00d7 [[A\u00e9rospatiale Gazelle|Gazelle HT.2/HT.3]]\n* '''Trainers''':\n** 3\u00d7 [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra TT.18]]\n** 14\u00d7 [[de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk|Chipmunk T.10]]\n** 5\u00d7 [[Hawker Hunter|Hunter T.8M]]\n** 12\u00d7/9\u00d7 [[Hawker Hunter|Hunter GA.11/T8]]\n** 19\u00d7 [[Handley Page Jetstream|Jetstream T.2]]\n* '''Liaison''':\n** 16\u00d7 [[Dassault Falcon 20]] (Civil-registered)\n\n===Post Cold War===\n[[File:Four FA2 Sea Harriers, based at RNAS Yeovilton, flying in formation above the clouds, photographed as part of a Photex.

Thirty three unmarried men signed up for eighteen months full-time flying training; however, before these first volunteers were able to gain their wings Britain was at war. At the end of hostilities in 1945 the RNVR(A) was 46,000 strong, with over 8,000 aircrew. Post war the RNVR(A) comprised 12 dedicated reserve squadrons, grouped regionally into Air Divisions. However, defence cuts in 1957 disbanded the five Air Divisions, and the following year the RNVR was merged with the RNR. The RNR Air Branch was commissioned at RNAS Yeovilton on 16 July 1980, and shortly afterwards 38 ex-regular aircrew began refresher training. Today the RNR Air Branch comprises approximately 250 ex-regular service Officers and Ratings, covering all aviation trades, tasked to support the Fleet Air Arm.\n\nAs of 1 December 2013, the Regular Fleet Air Arm has a reported strength of 5,000 personnel,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dasa.mod.uk/publications/personnel/military/navy-monthly-situation-report/2013-12-01/1-december-2013.pdf |title=Royal Navy monthly situation report |date=1 December 2013 |quote=See table 4a page 18 and table 4b page 20 |access-date=9 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202125201/http://www.dasa.mod.uk/publications/personnel/military/navy-monthly-situation-report/2013-12-01/1-december-2013.pdf |archive-date=2 February 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> which represents approximately 20% of the Royal Navy's total strength (excluding [[Royal Marines]]).\n\nThe [[Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff (Aviation & Carriers)]], the professional head (and also Rear Admiral Fleet Air Arm), is Rear Admiral [[Martin Connell (Royal Navy officer)|Martin Connell]] as of February 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fleetairarmoa.org/news/all-change-at-the-top-fleet-air-arm-|title=https://www.fleetairarmoa.org/news/all-change-at-the-top-fleet-air-arm-|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nUnder First Sea Lord Admiral [[Tony Radakin]]\u2019s plans, the professional head of the Fleet Air Arm is set to shortly change to a one-star role, headed by a [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|Commodore]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forces.net/news/royal-navy-cut-back-senior-personnel|title=Royal Navy To Cut Back On Senior Personnel|last=at 2:35pm|first=23rd December 2019|website=Forces Network|language=en|access-date=2020-01-08}}</ref>\n\n==Aircraft==\n{{Further|List of active United Kingdom military aircraft}}\n\nThe FAA operates fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft.

The Naval Wing of the RFC lasted until July 1914 when the Royal Navy reformed its air branch, under the [[Air Department]] of the [[Admiralty]], naming it the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS).{{sfn|Roskill|1969|p=156}} By the outbreak of the First World War, in August 1914, the RNAS had more aircraft under its control than the remaining RFC.{{sfn|Bradbeer|2014|p=}}{{page needed|date=March 2020}} The roles of the RNAS were fleet reconnaissance, patrolling coasts for enemy ships and submarines, attacking enemy coastal territory and defending Britain from enemy air raids, along with deployment along the Western Front. In April 1918 the RNAS, which at this time had 67,000 officers and men, 2,949 aircraft, 103 airships and 126 coastal stations, merged with the RFC to form the [[Royal Air Force]].{{sfn|Boyne|2003|p=70}}\n\n===Fleet Air Arm===\nOn 1 April 1924, the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Air Force was formed, encompassing those RAF units that normally embarked on aircraft carriers and fighting ships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seayourhistory.org.uk/content/view/454/613/|title=Interwar: Fleet Air Arm|work=Sea Your History|accessdate=8 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402094005/http://www.seayourhistory.org.uk/content/view/454/613|archive-date=2 April 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The year was significant for British naval aviation as only weeks before the founding of the Fleet Air Arm, the Royal Navy had commissioned {{HMS|Hermes|95|6}}, the world's first ship to be designed and built as an aircraft carrier.

At the onset of the Second World War, the Fleet Air Arm consisted of 20 squadrons with only 232 frontline aircraft, and 191 additional trainers. By the end of the war the strength of the Fleet Air Arm was 59 aircraft carriers, 3,700 aircraft, 72,000 officers and men and 56 Naval air stations.\n\nDuring the war, the FAA operated fighters, torpedo bombers and reconnaissance aircraft. Following the [[Dunkirk evacuation]] and the commencement of the [[Battle of Britain]], the [[Royal Air Force]] soon found itself critically short of fighter pilots. In the summer of 1940, the RAF had just over 800 fighter pilots and as personnel shortages worsened; the RAF turned to the Admiralty to ask for help from the Fleet Air Arm. Fleet Air Arm crews under [[RAF Fighter Command]] were either seconded individually to RAF fighter squadrons or entire as with 804 and 808 Naval Air Squadrons. The former provided dockyard defence during the Battle of Britain with [[Gloster Gladiator|Sea Gladiators]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fleetairarmarchive.net/RollofHonour/Battlehonour_crewlists/BattleofBritain_FAAaircrew_1940.html |title=Fleet Air Arm squadrons taking part in the Battle of Britain under RAF Fighter Command |work=Fleet Air Arm Archive 1939-1945 |accessdate=8 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150625093132/http://www.fleetairarmarchive.net/RollofHonour/Battlehonour_crewlists/BattleofBritain_FAAaircrew_1940.html |archive-date=25 June 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn British home waters and out into the [[Atlantic Ocean]], operations against Axis shipping and submarines in support of the RN were mounted by [[RAF Coastal Command]] with large patrol bombers, flying boats and land-based fighter-bombers. The [[aircraft carrier]] had replaced the [[battleship]] as the [[capital ship]] of the RN and its aircraft were now its principal offensive weapons. The top scoring [[Flying ace|fighter ace]] with 17 victories was Commander [[Stanley Orr]], the [[Royal Marines|Royal Marine]] ace was [[Ronald Cuthbert Hay]] with 13 victories. A number of Royal Marines were [[History of the Royal Marines#Second World War|FAA pilots]] during the war.\n\nNotable Fleet Air Arm operations during the war included the [[Battle of Taranto]], the sinking of the [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']], [[Operation Tungsten]] against the [[German battleship Tirpitz|''Tirpitz'']] and [[Operation Meridian]] against oil plants in [[Sumatra]].\n\n===Post-war history===\n[[File:SeaFury launch.jpg|thumb|right|Hawker Sea Fury of No. 804 Squadron launched off {{HMS|Glory|R62|6}} during the Korean War, June 1951]]\n[[File:Phantom FG1 892 Sqn on HMS Ark Royal (R09) 1972.jpg|thumb|right|Phantom FG.1 of 892 NAS aboard {{HMS|Ark Royal|R09|6}} in 1972]]\n[[File:DN-SC-87-05770.JPEG|thumb|right|Two [[British Aerospace Sea Harrier|Sea Harriers]] from [[800 Naval Air Squadron]] approach the flight deck of [[U.S. Navy]] aircraft carrier {{USS|Dwight D. Eisenhower||6}} in 1984]]\nAfter the war the FAA needed to fly [[jet aircraft]] from their carriers. The jet aircraft of the era were considerably less effective at low speeds than propeller aircraft, but propeller aircraft could not effectively fight jets at the high speeds flown by jet aircraft. The FAA took on its first jet, the [[De Havilland Vampire|Sea Vampire]], in the late 1940s. The Sea Vampire was the first jet credited with taking off and landing on a carrier. The Air Arm continued with high-powered prop aircraft alongside the new jets resulting in the FAA being woefully outpowered during the [[Korean War]]. Nevertheless, jets were not yet wholly superior to propeller aircraft and a flight of ground attack [[Hawker Sea Fury|Hawker Sea Furies]] downed a [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] and damaged others in an engagement.\n\nAs jets became larger, more powerful and faster they required more space to take off and land. The [[US Navy]] simply built much larger carriers. The Royal Navy had a few large carriers built and completed after the end of the war but another solution was sought. This was partly overcome by the introduction of a Royal Navy idea to [[flight deck#Angled flight deck|angle the flight deck]] away from the centre line so that the aircraft landing had a clear run away from the usual forward deck park. An associated British invention, intended to provide more precise optical guidance to aircraft on final approaching the deck, was the [[Optical Landing System#Fresnel Lens Optical Landing System (FLOLS)|Fresnel lens optical landing aid]]. Another Royal Navy invention was the use of a [[steam catapult|steam-powered catapult]] to cater for the larger and heavier aircraft (both systems were adopted by the US Navy).\n\nDefence cuts across the British armed forces [[1966 Defence White Paper|during the 1960s and 1970s]] led to the withdrawal of existing Royal Navy aircraft carriers, transfer of Fleet Air Arm fixed-wing jet strike aircraft such as the [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4K (FG.1) Phantom II]] and [[Blackburn Buccaneer|Buccaneer S.2]] to the Royal Air Force, and cancellation of large replacement aircraft carriers, including the [[CVA-01]] design. The last conventional carrier to be retired was {{HMS|Ark Royal|R09|6}} in 1978.<ref>Manning, p. 149</ref> Although HMS ''Hermes'' was converted in 1980/81 to a STOVL carrier to operate Sea Harriers, a ramp was fitted to aid take-off. A new series of small carriers, the [[Invincible class aircraft carrier|''Invincible'' class]] anti-submarine warfare ships (known as \"through deck cruisers\") were built and equipped with the [[BAE Sea Harrier|Sea Harrier]] a derivative of the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier]] [[VTOL]] aircraft. These carriers incorporated an upswept forward section of the flight deck that deflected the aircraft upward on launch and permitted heavier loads to be carried by the Harrier, for example in weaponry, and the system was used extensively in the Falklands War, with both ''Hermes'' and ''Invincible'' part of the Task Force.\nAt the end of the [[Cold War]] in 1989 the Fleet Air Arm was under the command of the [[Flag Officer Naval Air Command]], a [[Rear admiral (Royal Navy)|rear admiral]] based at [[RNAS Yeovilton]].\n* '''[[Flag Officer Naval Air Command]]''' (FONAC), at [[RNAS Yeovilton]]\n** '''[[RNAS Prestwick]]''':\n*** [[819 Naval Air Squadron]], ([[Anti-submarine warfare|Anti-submarine]], 12\u00d7 [[Westland Sea King|Sea King HAS.5]])\n*** [[826 Naval Air Squadron]], (Anti-submarine, 12\u00d7 Sea King HAS.6)\n*** [[HMS Gannet SAR Flight]], ([[Search and Rescue|Search & Rescue]], 8\u00d7 [[Westland Sea King|Sea King HU.5]])\n** '''[[RNAS Yeovilton]]''':\n*** [[707 Naval Air Squadron]], ([[Air Assault]], 10\u00d7 [[Westland Sea King|Sea King HC.4]])\n*** [[800 Naval Air Squadron]], (12\u00d7 [[British Aerospace Sea Harrier|Sea Harrier FA.2]])\n*** [[801 Naval Air Squadron]], (12\u00d7 Sea Harrier FA.2)\n*** [[845 Naval Air Squadron]], (Air Assault, 10\u00d7 Sea King HC.4)\n*** [[846 Naval Air Squadron]], (Air Assault, 10\u00d7 Sea King HC.4)\n*** [[899 Naval Air Squadron]], (Training, 24\u00d7 Sea Harrier FA.2)\n*** [[Fleet Requirements and Aircraft Direction Unit]], (Aggressor Squadron, [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra TT.18]], [[Hawker Hunter|Hawker Hunter GA.11]])\n** '''[[RNAS Culdrose (HMS Seahawk)|RNAS Culdrose]]''':\n*** [[705 Naval Air Squadron]], (Basic Helicopter Training, 38\u00d7 [[A\u00e9rospatiale Gazelle|Gazelle HT.2]])\n*** [[706 Naval Air Squadron]], (Sea King Training, 12\u00d7 various types of Sea King)\n*** [[750 Naval Air Squadron]], (Observer Training, [[Handley Page Jetstream|Jetstream T2]])\n*** [[771 Naval Air Squadron]], (Search & Rescue, 12\u00d7 [[Westland Sea King|Sea King HU.5]])\n*** [[814 Naval Air Squadron]], (Anti-submarine, 12\u00d7 Sea King HAS.5)\n*** [[820 Naval Air Squadron]], (Anti-submarine, 12\u00d7 Sea King HAS.6)\n*** [[824 Naval Air Squadron]], (Anti-submarine, 12\u00d7 Sea King HAS.6) (disbanded August 1989)\n*** [[849 Naval Air Squadron]], ([[Airborne early warning and control]], 10\u00d7 Sea King AEW.2A, 4\u00d7 Sea King AEW.5)\n** '''[[RNAS Portland (HMS Osprey)|RNAS Portland]]''':\n*** [[702 Naval Air Squadron]], (Aircrew & Maintenance Training, 24\u00d7 [[Westland Lynx|Lynx HAS.3S]])\n*** [[772 Naval Air Squadron]], (Air Assault, 10\u00d7 Sea King HC.4)\n*** [[810 Naval Air Squadron]], (Anti-submarine, 12\u00d7 Sea King HAS.6)\n*** [[815 Naval Air Squadron]], (Frigate & Destroyer Helicopters, 32\u00d7 Lynx HAS.3S, most deployed on frigates and destroyers at sea)\n*** [[829 Naval Air Squadron]], (Frigate & Destroyer Helicopters, 32\u00d7 Lynx HAS.3S, most deployed on frigates and destroyers at sea)\n\n==== Fleet Air Arm Inventory 1989 ====\nThe inventory of the Fleet Air Arm in 1989 consisted of the following aircraft:<ref name=\"World's Air Forces 1989\">{{cite journal|title=World's Air Forces 1989|journal=Flight International|date=29 November 1989|pages=61\u201362|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1989/1989%20-%203700.html|accessdate=19 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201034011/https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1989/1989%20-%203700.html|archive-date=1 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* '''Combat aircraft''':\n** 42\u00d7 [[British Aerospace Sea Harrier|Sea Harrier FRS.1/F(A).2]]\n** 2x/2\u00d7 [[British Aerospace Sea Harrier|Sea Harrier T.4A/T.4N]]\n* '''Helicopters''':\n** 60+ [[Westland Sea King|Sea King HAS.5]]\n** 31+ [[Westland Sea King|Sea King HAS.6]]\n** 10\u00d7 [[Westland Sea King|Sea King AEW.2A]]\n** 33\u00d7 [[Westland Sea King|Sea King HC.4]]\n** 80+ [[Westland Lynx|Lynx HAS.3S]]\n** 23\u00d7/8\u00d7 [[A\u00e9rospatiale Gazelle|Gazelle HT.2/HT.3]]\n* '''Trainers''':\n** 3\u00d7 [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra TT.18]]\n** 14\u00d7 [[de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk|Chipmunk T.10]]\n** 5\u00d7 [[Hawker Hunter|Hunter T.8M]]\n** 12\u00d7/9\u00d7 [[Hawker Hunter|Hunter GA.11/T8]]\n** 19\u00d7 [[Handley Page Jetstream|Jetstream T.2]]\n* '''Liaison''':\n** 16\u00d7 [[Dassault Falcon 20]] (Civil-registered)\n\n===Post Cold War===\n[[File:Four FA2 Sea Harriers, based at RNAS Yeovilton, flying in formation above the clouds, photographed as part of a Photex.

Initially used in the [[search and rescue]] role, they were later developed for [[anti-submarine warfare]] and [[Military transport aircraft#Transport helicopters|troop transport]]; during the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]] they were used to land [[Royal Marine Commando]] forces, the first time this had ever been done in combat.<ref>Darling, p. 224</ref> Originally operated only from carriers, the development of the [[Westland Wasp]] in the 1960s allowed helicopters to operate on all ships of [[frigate]] size or larger. Wasps, [[Westland Sea King|Sea Kings]] and [[Westland Wessex|Wessex]] helicopters all played an active part in the 1982 Falklands War, while [[Westland Lynx|Lynx]] helicopters played an attack role against Iraqi patrol boats in the 1991 [[Gulf War]] and [[Westland Sea King#Troop transport|Commando Sea King HC4s]] as well as the Lynx HMA Mk 8 from HMS Argyll, assisted in suppressing rebel forces in the [[British military intervention in the Sierra Leone Civil War|British intervention in the Sierra Leone Civil War]] in 2000.\n\n====Museums====\nThe Fleet Air Arm has a [[Fleet Air Arm Museum|museum]] near [[RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron)]] in Somerset, England at which many of the great historical aircraft flown by the Service are on display, along with aircraft from other sources. There is also a Fleet Air Arm museum inside the Museum of Transport and Technology ([[MOTAT]]) in Auckland, New Zealand. On display there is a full-size replica Fairey Swordfish, along with historic items and memorabilia.\n\n==The FAA today==\n\n===Personnel===\nIn 1938, Admiralty [[Fleet Orders]] 2885 announced the formation of an Air Branch of the [[Royal Naval Reserve]]. Thirty three unmarried men signed up for eighteen months full-time flying training; however, before these first volunteers were able to gain their wings Britain was at war. At the end of hostilities in 1945 the RNVR(A) was 46,000 strong, with over 8,000 aircrew. Post war the RNVR(A) comprised 12 dedicated reserve squadrons, grouped regionally into Air Divisions. However, defence cuts in 1957 disbanded the five Air Divisions, and the following year the RNVR was merged with the RNR. The RNR Air Branch was commissioned at RNAS Yeovilton on 16 July 1980, and shortly afterwards 38 ex-regular aircrew began refresher training. Today the RNR Air Branch comprises approximately 250 ex-regular service Officers and Ratings, covering all aviation trades, tasked to support the Fleet Air Arm.\n\nAs of 1 December 2013, the Regular Fleet Air Arm has a reported strength of 5,000 personnel,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dasa.mod.uk/publications/personnel/military/navy-monthly-situation-report/2013-12-01/1-december-2013.pdf |title=Royal Navy monthly situation report |date=1 December 2013 |quote=See table 4a page 18 and table 4b page 20 |access-date=9 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202125201/http://www.dasa.mod.uk/publications/personnel/military/navy-monthly-situation-report/2013-12-01/1-december-2013.pdf |archive-date=2 February 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> which represents approximately 20% of the Royal Navy's total strength (excluding [[Royal Marines]]).\n\nThe [[Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff (Aviation & Carriers)]], the professional head (and also Rear Admiral Fleet Air Arm), is Rear Admiral [[Martin Connell (Royal Navy officer)|Martin Connell]] as of February 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fleetairarmoa.org/news/all-change-at-the-top-fleet-air-arm-|title=https://www.fleetairarmoa.org/news/all-change-at-the-top-fleet-air-arm-|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nUnder First Sea Lord Admiral [[Tony Radakin]]\u2019s plans, the professional head of the Fleet Air Arm is set to shortly change to a one-star role, headed by a [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|Commodore]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forces.net/news/royal-navy-cut-back-senior-personnel|title=Royal Navy To Cut Back On Senior Personnel|last=at 2:35pm|first=23rd December 2019|website=Forces Network|language=en|access-date=2020-01-08}}</ref>\n\n==Aircraft==\n{{Further|List of active United Kingdom military aircraft}}\n\nThe FAA operates fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft.

However, the introduction of the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|F-35B Lightning II]] will see a restoration of fixed wing, front-line operations. An initial order of 48 airframes was made in 2012 to equip the air wings of the planned two [[Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier]]s, with the operation split between the FAA and the [[Royal Air Force]], as was the case with [[Joint Force Harrier]]. [[809 Naval Air Squadron]] was announced as the second UK unit to fly the F-35B, the first being [[No. 617 Squadron RAF|617 Squadron RAF]], and will be the first Fleet Air Arm unit to operate the aircraft. It is understood that at least two further frontline squadrons will stand up in the future alongside 809, 617, [[No. 17 Squadron RAF|17(R) Test and Evaluation Squadron]] and an RAF-numbered Operational Conversion Unit, creating a front-line fleet of four squadrons in addition to the OCU and OEU.

After two days, on 15 September 1595, the town council sent John MacMorran, as a Baillie of Edinburgh, to end the [[sit-in]]. MacMorran and his men were about to break in, using a beam as a battering-ram, when he was shot in the head and died instantly. The shot was fired from a window by the 13-year-old son of William [[Clan Sinclair|Sinclair]] of [[Castle of Mey|Mey]], uncle and Chancellor of the [[Earl of Caithness]].<ref> [https://archive.org/details/fragmentsscotis00dalygoog/page/n140 'The Diarey (sic) of Robert Birrell', in John Graham Dalyell, ''Fragments of Scottish History'' (Edinburgh, 1798), pp. 34-35].</ref>\n\nThe boys either fled or were captured.

He sat in the [[Irish House of Commons]] as member for [[Clonmines (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Clonmines]], but though he was noted for his  wit and talent, he  did not have much reputation as a politician.<ref>Ball, p.181</ref>\n\nHe was appointed a justice of the [[Court of Common Pleas (Ireland)|Court of Common Pleas]] in 1793 and was transferred to the [[Court of King's Bench (Ireland)|Court of King's Bench]] the following year. He sat on the Special Commission to deal with the [[Rebellion of 1798]].\n\n==Last years==\n\nHis health was poor: he called himself \"a martyr to the [[gout]]\".<ref>Ball, p.242</ref> He died in 1802, aged only 51. He was buried in [[St. Ann's Church, Dawson Street]]. His widow moved to England: she  died at [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in  1831.\n\n==State trials==\nAs he was  generally agreed to be an able and conscientious judge, it was natural that Chamberlain should play a large part in the political trials of the mid-1790s, which culminated in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]]. That he should be attacked by [[United Irishmen]] and nationalists generally was understandable; but one notable trial, that of [[William Orr (United Irishman)|William Orr]], damaged his reputation even among his admirers.<ref>Ball, p.183</ref>\n\nHe sat on a commission to try cases of [[treason]] in 1795-6, but most of the accused were acquitted.<ref>Ball, p.184</ref> At the summer assizes in [[Armagh]] in 1797, where more than 150 people were tried for [[sedition]], Chamberlain had \"the awful and unexampled duty\" of sentencing 20 men to death at one sitting.<ref>Ball, p. 184</ref> After the 1798 Rebellion he sat on the special commission to try the rebels, but the verdicts  do not suggest  that he displayed any great severity: only five people were put on trial and only one was hanged.<ref>Ball, p.185</ref>\n\nAnother state trial, that of Patrick Finney in 1798, shows Chamberlain  as a judge at his best. Finney, a Dublin tobacconist, was charged with treason, largely on the word of one James O'Brien.<ref>''Speeches of John Philpot Curran''  New York 1811 Vol.1  p.252</ref> He was defended by [[John Philpot Curran]], who in one of his most famous speeches destroyed O'Brien's credit. Chamberlain conducted the trial with notable fairness: in his summing up  he cast doubt on the evidence of O'Brien, and virtually directed an acquittal.<ref>''Speeches of John Philpot Curran''  pp.276\u20137</ref> The jury found Finney not guilty.

Orr was tried at the summer assizes in 1797 before [[Barry Yelverton, 1st Viscount Avonmore|Lord Avonmore]], the [[Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer]], and Chamberlain.<ref>Ball, p. 183</ref> [[John Philpot Curran]], defending, exposed Wheately as a liar and man of bad character and argued that the jury had no choice but to acquit. His argument that the judges had misstated the law led to angry exchanges between counsel and the Bench. The circumstances which led to the guilty verdict later caused much comment, two of the jury claiming that they had been made drunk, and two others claiming that they had been threatened. It may be that the judges themselves had doubts about Orr's guilt as Avonmore is said to have shed tears as he pronounced the death sentence. Despite numerous pleas for a reprieve, Orr was hanged at [[Carrickfergus]] on 14 October. Wheatley, the crucial witness against him, died soon afterwards, probably by his own hand. Shortly before his death he is said to have confessed that he had [[perjured]] himself at Orr's trial.\n\nAs it is generally accepted now  that Orr was innocent,<ref>Ball,  p.183</ref> Chamberlain clearly shares the responsibility for the miscarriage of justice; however,  Avonmore was very much the senior judge and  seems to have dominated the proceedings. The Government, aware of the hostile public reaction, praised both judges for \"integrity and humanity\". On the other hand, a Dublin newspaper, ''The Press'', was sufficiently concerned by the trial to attack the conduct of both judges, and the editor, [[Peter Finnerty]] was prosecuted and convicted for [[seditious libel]] as a result.<ref>Ball, p.183</ref>\n\n==Character==\nChamberlain was praised as an able and upright judge and  a sound lawyer; even his conduct of the Orr trial had its defenders.<ref>Ball, p.183</ref> When he died in 1802, the newly appointed [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]], [[John Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron Redesdale|Lord Redesdale]], was warned that it would not be easy to find a suitable replacement.<ref>Ball, p.242</ref> He  had a  great  gift for friendship: his colleague, later [[Lord Chief Justice of Ireland]], [[William Downes, 1st Baron Downes|Lord Downes]], when he died in 1826 asked to be buried in [[St. Ann's Church, Dawson Street]],   beside Chamberlain, his inseparable friend for many years: \"their union and friendship was complete....and now they lie together in the same tomb\".
