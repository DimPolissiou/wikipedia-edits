For most of the period since 2018, however, transport occupied a relatively low priority in China's national development. In the twenty-five years that followed the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, China's transportation network was built into a partially modern but somewhat inefficient system. The drive to modernize the transport system, that began in 1978, required a sharp acceleration in investment. Though despite increased investment and development in the 1980s, the transport sector was strained by the rapid expansion of production and the exchange of goods.<ref>[[Fengbo Zhang]]:[http://sites.google.com/site/chinesetransportation1/  Economic Analysis of Chinese Transportation]</ref>\n\nInadequate transport systems hindered the movement of [[coal]] from [[coal mine|mine]] to user, the transport of agricultural and light industrial products from rural to urban areas, and the delivery of imports and exports {{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}. As a result, the underdeveloped transport system constrained the pace of [[economic development]] throughout the country. In the 1980s the updating of transport systems was given priority, and investment and improvements were made throughout the transport sector {{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}.\n\n== Bridges ==\n[[Image:Donghai Bridge.jpg|thumb|[[Donghai Bridge]]]]\n\n{{see also|List of bridges in China}}\nIn the late 1980s, China had more than 140,000 highway [[bridge]]s. Their length totaled almost 4,000 kilometers. Among the best known were the [[Yellow River]] Bridge in [[Inner Mongolia]], the Liu Jiang Bridge in [[Guangxi]], the Ou Jiang Bridge in [[Zhejiang]], the Quanzhou Bridge in [[Fujian]], and four large bridges along the [[Guangzhou]]-[[Shenzhen]] highway. Five major bridges \u2014 including China's longest highway bridge, the 5,560-meter-long Yellow River Bridge at [[Zhengzhou]] \u2014 were under construction during the mid-1980s, and a 10,282-meter-long railroad bridge across the Yellow River on the [[Shandong]]-[[Henan]] border was completed in 1985.\n\n== Inland waterways ==\n{{main|Rivers of China|History of canals in China}}\n[[History of canals in China|China's canal system]], whose greatest accomplishment was the [[Sui dynasty]]'s {{convert|1794|km|mi|sp=us|adj=on}} 7th-century [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]] between [[Hangzhou]] and [[Beijing]], was an essential aspect of its civilization, used for irrigation, [[flood control]], [[taxation in premodern China|taxation]], commercial and [[military history of China before 1911|military transport]], and colonization of new lands from the [[Zhou dynasty]] until the end of the imperial era. There was widespread destruction of the canal system throughout the wars of the first half of the 20th century. Beginning in 1960 the network of navigable inland waterways decreased because of the construction of [[dam]]s and [[irrigation]] works and the increasing [[sedimentation]]. But by the early 1980s, as the railroads became increasingly congested, the authorities came to see water transport as a much less expensive alternative to new road and railroad construction.\n\n[[Image:Canal, Jia Ding2.JPG|thumb|A canal in [[Jiading District|Jiading]], Shanghai]]\n\nThe central government set out to overhaul the inefficient inland waterway system and called upon localities to play major roles in managing and financing most of the projects. By 1984 China's longest river, the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]], with a total of 70,000 kilometers of waterways open to shipping on its main stream and 3,600 kilometers on its tributaries, became the nation's busiest shipping lane, carrying 72 percent of China's total waterborne traffic. An estimated 340,000 people and 170,000 boats were engaged in the water transport business. More than 800 [[shipping]] enterprises and 60 [[shipping companies]] transported over 259 million tons of cargo on the Yangtze River and its tributaries in 1984. Nationally, in 1985 the inland waterways carried some 434 million tons of cargo. In 1986 there were approximately 138,600 kilometers of inland waterways, 79 percent of which were navigable.\n\nThe [[Cihuai Canal]] in northern [[Anhui]] opened to navigation in 1984. This 134-kilometer canal linking the Ying River, a major tributary of the [[Huai River]], with the Huai He's main course, had an annual capacity of 600,000 tons of cargo. The canal promoted the flow of goods between Anhui and neighboring provinces and helped to develop the Huai River Plain, one of China's major [[grain]]-producing areas.\n\n== Maritime shipping ==\n[[Image:Xinjianzhen06s3200.jpg|thumb|right|''Xinjianzhen'', a Chinese ship anchored in [[Kobe]] harbor, Japan]]\n\n{{main|Shipping industry in China}}\nDuring the early 1960s, China's [[merchant marine]] had fewer than thirty ships. By the 1970s and 1980s, [[maritime shipping]] capabilities had greatly increased. In 1985 China established eleven shipping offices and jointly operated [[shipping companies]] in foreign countries. In 1986 China ranked ninth in world shipping with more than 600 ships and a total [[tonnage]] of 16 million, including modern [[Roll-on/roll-off|roll-on and roll-off]] ships, [[container ship]]s, large [[bulk carrier]]s, [[refrigerator]] ships, [[oil tanker]]s, and multipurpose ships. The fleet called at more than 400 ports in more than 100 countries.\n\nThe container ship fleet also was expanding rapidly. In 1984 China had only fifteen container ships. Seven more were added in 1985, and an additional twenty-two were on order. By the early 1980s, Chinese [[shipbuilding|shipyards]] had begun to manufacture a large number of ships for their own maritime fleet. The [[China Shipping Inspection Bureau]] became a member of the [[Suez Canal Authority]] in 1984, empowering China to sign and issue [[seaworthiness]] certificates for ships on the [[Suez Canal]] and confirming the good reputation and maturity of its [[shipbuilding industry]]. In 1986 China had 523 shipyards of various sizes, 160 specialized factories, 540,000 employees, and more than 80 scientific research institutes. The main shipbuilding and repairing bases of Shanghai, Dalian, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Wuhan had 14 [[Berth (moorings)|berth]]s for 10,000-ton-class ships and 13 [[Dock (maritime)|dock]]s.\n\nThe inadequacy of [[port]] and [[harbor]] facilities was a longstanding problem for China but has become a more serious obstacle because of increased foreign trade. Beginning in the 1970s, the authorities gave priority to port construction. From 1972 to 1982, port traffic increased sixfold, largely because of the foreign trade boom. The imbalance between [[supply and demand]] continued to grow. Poor management and limited port facilities created such backups that by 1985 an average of 400 to 500 ships were waiting to enter major Chinese ports on any given day. The July 1985 delay of more than 500 ships, for instance, caused huge losses. All of China's major ports are undergoing some construction. To speed [[economic development]], the Seventh Five-Year Plan called for the construction by 1990 of 200 new berths \u2014 120 deep-water berths for ships above 10,000 tons and 80 medium-sized berths for ships below 10,000 tons \u2014 bringing the total number of berths to 1,200. Major port facilities were developed all along China's coast.\n\n== Civil aviation ==\n{{main|Aviation industry in China}}\n\nIn 1987 China's [[civil aviation]] system was operated by the [[General Administration of Civil Aviation of China]] (CAAC). By 1987 China had more than 229,000 kilometers of domestic air routes and more than 94,000 kilometers of international air routes. The more than 9 million passengers and 102,000 tons of freight traffic represented a 40 percent growth over the previous year. The air fleet consisted of about 175 [[aircraft]] and smaller [[turboprop]] transports. CAAC had 274 air routes, including 33 international flights to 28 cities in 23 countries, such as [[Tokyo]], [[Osaka]], [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], [[New York City]], [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles]], [[London]], [[Paris]], [[Frankfurt]], [[East Berlin]], [[Zurich]], [[Moscow]], [[Istanbul]], [[Manila]], [[Bangkok]], [[Singapore]], [[Sydney]], and [[Hong Kong]]. Almost 200 domestic air routes connected such major cities as [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]], [[Tianjin]], [[Guangzhou]], [[Hangzhou]], [[Kunming]], [[Chengdu]] and [[Xi'an]], as well as a number of smaller cities. The government had bilateral air service agreements with more than 40 countries and working relations with approximately 386 foreign airline companies. CAAC also provided air service for [[agriculture]], [[forestry]], [[communications]], and [[scientific research]].\n\n[[Image:Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport]]]]\n\nThe staff of CAAC was estimated at approximately 50,000 in the 1980s. The administration operated three training colleges to educate future [[airline]] [[personnel]]. In a bid to improve CAAC's services, more [[Ticket (admission)|ticket]] offices were opened in major cities for domestic and international flights.\n\nIn the mid-1980s regional airlines began operations under the general aegis of CAAC. [[Wuhan Airlines]], run by the [[Wuhan]] municipal authorities, started scheduled passenger flights to [[Hubei]], [[Hunan]], [[Guangdong]], and [[Sichuan]] provinces in May 1986. [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Xizang]] also planned to set up its own airline to fly to [[Kathmandu]] and [[Hong Kong]].\n\nIn the 1980s the central government increased its investment in airport construction, and some local governments also granted special funds for such projects. [[Lhasa Gonggar Airport|Lhasa Airport]] in Tibet, [[Jiamusi Airport]] in Heilongjiang, and [[Kashgar airport]] and [[Yining airport]]s in [[Xinjiang]] were expanded, and new airports were under construction in [[Xi'an]], [[Luoyang]] and [[Shenzhen]]. An investment of \u00a5500 million was planned for expanding runways and building new terminals and other airport facilities. In 1986 China had more than ninety civilian airports, of which eight could accommodate [[Boeing 747]]s and thirty-two could accommodate [[Boeing 737]]s and [[Hawker Siddeley Trident|Tridents]].\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Ministry of Transport of the People's Republic of China]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{loc}} [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/cntoc.html]\n\n{{Transport in China}}\n\n[[Category:Transport in China]]\n[[Category:History of China by topic]]\n[[Category:History of transport in China| ]]\n", "text_old": "[[Image:Beijing Subway Longze station.jpg|thumb|right|[[Beijing Subway]], Longze station]]\n[[File:Horse-drawn conveyances bearing goods on a Chinese road, 1987.jpg|thumb|right|Horse-drawn conveyances bearing goods and coal on a road in China, 1987.]]\n{{main|Transport in China}}\n[[Transport]] has been a major factor in [[China]]'s national [[Economy of China|economy]].

Though despite increased investment and development in the 1980s, the transport sector was strained by the rapid expansion of production and the exchange of goods.<ref>[[Fengbo Zhang]]:[http://sites.google.com/site/chinesetransportation1/  Economic Analysis of Chinese Transportation]</ref>\n\nInadequate transport systems hindered the movement of [[coal]] from [[coal mine|mine]] to user, the transport of agricultural and light industrial products from rural to urban areas, and the delivery of imports and exports {{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}. As a result, the underdeveloped transport system constrained the pace of [[economic development]] throughout the country. In the 1980s the updating of transport systems was given priority, and investment and improvements were made throughout the transport sector {{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}.\n\n== Bridges ==\n[[Image:Donghai Bridge.jpg|thumb|[[Donghai Bridge]]]]\n\n{{see also|List of bridges in China}}\nIn the late 1980s, China had more than 140,000 highway [[bridge]]s. Their length totaled almost 4,000 kilometers. Among the best known were the [[Yellow River]] Bridge in [[Inner Mongolia]], the Liu Jiang Bridge in [[Guangxi]], the Ou Jiang Bridge in [[Zhejiang]], the Quanzhou Bridge in [[Fujian]], and four large bridges along the [[Guangzhou]]-[[Shenzhen]] highway. Five major bridges \u2014 including China's longest highway bridge, the 5,560-meter-long Yellow River Bridge at [[Zhengzhou]] \u2014 were under construction during the mid-1980s, and a 10,282-meter-long railroad bridge across the Yellow River on the [[Shandong]]-[[Henan]] border was completed in 1985.\n\n== Inland waterways ==\n{{main|Rivers of China|History of canals in China}}\n[[History of canals in China|China's canal system]], whose greatest accomplishment was the [[Sui dynasty]]'s {{convert|1794|km|mi|sp=us|adj=on}} 7th-century [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]] between [[Hangzhou]] and [[Beijing]], was an essential aspect of its civilization, used for irrigation, [[flood control]], [[taxation in premodern China|taxation]], commercial and [[military history of China before 1911|military transport]], and colonization of new lands from the [[Zhou dynasty]] until the end of the imperial era. There was widespread destruction of the canal system throughout the wars of the first half of the 20th century. Beginning in 1960 the network of navigable inland waterways decreased because of the construction of [[dam]]s and [[irrigation]] works and the increasing [[sedimentation]]. But by the early 1980s, as the railroads became increasingly congested, the authorities came to see water transport as a much less expensive alternative to new road and railroad construction.\n\n[[Image:Canal, Jia Ding2.JPG|thumb|A canal in [[Jiading District|Jiading]], Shanghai]]\n\nThe central government set out to overhaul the inefficient inland waterway system and called upon localities to play major roles in managing and financing most of the projects. By 1984 China's longest river, the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]], with a total of 70,000 kilometers of waterways open to shipping on its main stream and 3,600 kilometers on its tributaries, became the nation's busiest shipping lane, carrying 72 percent of China's total waterborne traffic. An estimated 340,000 people and 170,000 boats were engaged in the water transport business. More than 800 [[shipping]] enterprises and 60 [[shipping companies]] transported over 259 million tons of cargo on the Yangtze River and its tributaries in 1984. Nationally, in 1985 the inland waterways carried some 434 million tons of cargo. In 1986 there were approximately 138,600 kilometers of inland waterways, 79 percent of which were navigable.\n\nThe [[Cihuai Canal]] in northern [[Anhui]] opened to navigation in 1984. This 134-kilometer canal linking the Ying River, a major tributary of the [[Huai River]], with the Huai He's main course, had an annual capacity of 600,000 tons of cargo. The canal promoted the flow of goods between Anhui and neighboring provinces and helped to develop the Huai River Plain, one of China's major [[grain]]-producing areas.\n\n== Maritime shipping ==\n[[Image:Xinjianzhen06s3200.jpg|thumb|right|''Xinjianzhen'', a Chinese ship anchored in [[Kobe]] harbor, Japan]]\n\n{{main|Shipping industry in China}}\nDuring the early 1960s, China's [[merchant marine]] had fewer than thirty ships. By the 1970s and 1980s, [[maritime shipping]] capabilities had greatly increased. In 1985 China established eleven shipping offices and jointly operated [[shipping companies]] in foreign countries. In 1986 China ranked ninth in world shipping with more than 600 ships and a total [[tonnage]] of 16 million, including modern [[Roll-on/roll-off|roll-on and roll-off]] ships, [[container ship]]s, large [[bulk carrier]]s, [[refrigerator]] ships, [[oil tanker]]s, and multipurpose ships. The fleet called at more than 400 ports in more than 100 countries.\n\nThe container ship fleet also was expanding rapidly. In 1984 China had only fifteen container ships. Seven more were added in 1985, and an additional twenty-two were on order. By the early 1980s, Chinese [[shipbuilding|shipyards]] had begun to manufacture a large number of ships for their own maritime fleet. The [[China Shipping Inspection Bureau]] became a member of the [[Suez Canal Authority]] in 1984, empowering China to sign and issue [[seaworthiness]] certificates for ships on the [[Suez Canal]] and confirming the good reputation and maturity of its [[shipbuilding industry]]. In 1986 China had 523 shipyards of various sizes, 160 specialized factories, 540,000 employees, and more than 80 scientific research institutes. The main shipbuilding and repairing bases of Shanghai, Dalian, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Wuhan had 14 [[Berth (moorings)|berth]]s for 10,000-ton-class ships and 13 [[Dock (maritime)|dock]]s.\n\nThe inadequacy of [[port]] and [[harbor]] facilities was a longstanding problem for China but has become a more serious obstacle because of increased foreign trade. Beginning in the 1970s, the authorities gave priority to port construction. From 1972 to 1982, port traffic increased sixfold, largely because of the foreign trade boom. The imbalance between [[supply and demand]] continued to grow. Poor management and limited port facilities created such backups that by 1985 an average of 400 to 500 ships were waiting to enter major Chinese ports on any given day. The July 1985 delay of more than 500 ships, for instance, caused huge losses. All of China's major ports are undergoing some construction. To speed [[economic development]], the Seventh Five-Year Plan called for the construction by 1990 of 200 new berths \u2014 120 deep-water berths for ships above 10,000 tons and 80 medium-sized berths for ships below 10,000 tons \u2014 bringing the total number of berths to 1,200. Major port facilities were developed all along China's coast.\n\n== Civil aviation ==\n{{main|Aviation industry in China}}\n\nIn 1987 China's [[civil aviation]] system was operated by the [[General Administration of Civil Aviation of China]] (CAAC). By 1987 China had more than 229,000 kilometers of domestic air routes and more than 94,000 kilometers of international air routes. The more than 9 million passengers and 102,000 tons of freight traffic represented a 40 percent growth over the previous year. The air fleet consisted of about 175 [[aircraft]] and smaller [[turboprop]] transports. CAAC had 274 air routes, including 33 international flights to 28 cities in 23 countries, such as [[Tokyo]], [[Osaka]], [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], [[New York City]], [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles]], [[London]], [[Paris]], [[Frankfurt]], [[East Berlin]], [[Zurich]], [[Moscow]], [[Istanbul]], [[Manila]], [[Bangkok]], [[Singapore]], [[Sydney]], and [[Hong Kong]]. Almost 200 domestic air routes connected such major cities as [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]], [[Tianjin]], [[Guangzhou]], [[Hangzhou]], [[Kunming]], [[Chengdu]] and [[Xi'an]], as well as a number of smaller cities. The government had bilateral air service agreements with more than 40 countries and working relations with approximately 386 foreign airline companies. CAAC also provided air service for [[agriculture]], [[forestry]], [[communications]], and [[scientific research]].\n\n[[Image:Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport]]]]\n\nThe staff of CAAC was estimated at approximately 50,000 in the 1980s. The administration operated three training colleges to educate future [[airline]] [[personnel]]. In a bid to improve CAAC's services, more [[Ticket (admission)|ticket]] offices were opened in major cities for domestic and international flights.\n\nIn the mid-1980s regional airlines began operations under the general aegis of CAAC. [[Wuhan Airlines]], run by the [[Wuhan]] municipal authorities, started scheduled passenger flights to [[Hubei]], [[Hunan]], [[Guangdong]], and [[Sichuan]] provinces in May 1986. [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Xizang]] also planned to set up its own airline to fly to [[Kathmandu]] and [[Hong Kong]].\n\nIn the 1980s the central government increased its investment in airport construction, and some local governments also granted special funds for such projects. [[Lhasa Gonggar Airport|Lhasa Airport]] in Tibet, [[Jiamusi Airport]] in Heilongjiang, and [[Kashgar airport]] and [[Yining airport]]s in [[Xinjiang]] were expanded, and new airports were under construction in [[Xi'an]], [[Luoyang]] and [[Shenzhen]]. An investment of \u00a5500 million was planned for expanding runways and building new terminals and other airport facilities. In 1986 China had more than ninety civilian airports, of which eight could accommodate [[Boeing 747]]s and thirty-two could accommodate [[Boeing 737]]s and [[Hawker Siddeley Trident|Tridents]].\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Ministry of Transport of the People's Republic of China]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{loc}} [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/cntoc.html]\n\n{{Transport in China}}\n\n[[Category:Transport in China]]\n[[Category:History of China by topic]]\n[[Category:History of transport in China| ]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: , \u2192 ,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_transport_in_China"}

He served under this capacity from the camp's establishment until it ceased operations, between May 1992 and December 1992, under the command of the camp's deputy commander [[Hazim Deli\u0107]] and commander Zdravko Muci\u0107. As a guard, Land\u017eo beat, tortured and murdered Serb prisoners.\n\nOn 21 March 1996, the ICTY indicted Land\u017eo, Deli\u0107, Muci\u0107 and Zejnil Delali\u0107 for crimes against humanity at the camp, charging Land\u017eo with the specific murders of five people, four instances of torture and one case of causing great suffering and serious injury. On 16 November 1998, Land\u017eo was found guilty of violations of the laws and customs of war and grave breaches of the [[Geneva conventions]] and sentenced to 15 years in prison. The sentence was later upheld upon appeal and Land\u017eo was granted early release on 13 April 2006 after serving nearly eight years of his sentence.\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|Bosnian War|\u010celebi\u0107i camp}}\nDuring the \u010celebi\u0107i trial, the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] established the importance of the [[Konjic]] municipality both historically and strategically. Because it lied on the fault line between areas Croats and Serbs considered to be within their spheres of influences, both ethnic groups had a vested geographical interest. More importantly, it was the site of an arms and munitions factory as well as being an important communications link between Mostar and Sarajevo due to its railway line and highway.{{sfn|ICTY|16 November 1998|pp=49-50}}{{sfn|TRIAL International|Esad Landzo}}\n\nAs Bosnia descended into war, Konjic was not immune to the tension and suspicion among the ethnic groups. On 17 April 1992, Serb representatives from Konjic's Municipal Assembly and Executive Council walked out following the recognition of [[1992 Bosnian independence referendum|Bosnia as an independent state]].{{sfn|ICTY|Crimes in \u010celebi\u0107i|p=1}} In the meantime, Muslim and Croat officials formed a War Presidency and an interim \"Crisis Staff\" to deal with the municipality's administration and defence. By mid-April 1992, Bosnian Serb forces had effectively surrounded the town of Konjic and cut it off from both [[Sarajevo]] and [[Mostar]].{{sfn|ICTY|Crimes in \u010celebi\u0107i|p=1}} Muslim and Croat forces began to arrive in the city of Konjic from surrounding villages, while Serb inhabitants moved to Serb-controlled villages. Konjic's defence forces\u2014which at the time consisted of the [[Territorial Defence Force of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Territorial Defence Force]] (TO), the local [[Croatian Army]] (HVO) and the [[Federal Ministry of Interior (Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Ministry of the Interior]] (MUP)\u2014attempted to negotiate with the principal representative of the Serbian people, the [[Serbian Democratic Party]] (SDS) but these apparent negotiations failed and a military campaign was launched.{{sfn|ICTY|Crimes in \u010celebi\u0107i|pp=1-2}}\n\nBeginning in late May 1992, Bosniak and Croat forces attacked and seized control of certain Serb majority villages in the municipality of Konjic.{{sfn|TRIAL International|Esad Landzo}} These operations resulted in the detainment of many members of the Serb population. A former JNA facility located on the outskirts of the village of [[\u010celebi\u0107i (Konjic)|\u010celebi\u0107i]] was chosen as the facility to house the prisoners.{{sfn|ICTY|Crimes in \u010celebi\u0107i|p=2}} The majority of the prisoners were men, captured during military operations in these villages, but also included some women who were housed separately.{{sfn|ICTY|Crimes in \u010celebi\u0107i|p=2}}{{sfn|ICTY|16 November 1998|p=60}} Detainees at the camp were subjected to murder, torture, sexual violence and otherwise cruel and inhumane treatment.{{sfn|ICTY|Crimes in \u010celebi\u0107i|p=1-7}}\n\n==Profile==\nEsad Land\u017eo, also named Zenga,{{sfn|ICTY|16 November 1998|p=1}} was born on 7 March 1973 in [[Glavati\u010devo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].{{sfn|ICTY|Case Information Sheet|p=3}} At the outset of the war, he joined the Bosnian Army and was assigned to be a guard at the \u010celebi\u0107i camp.

Dragani\u0107 stated that Land\u017eo beat him almost every day, usually using a baseball bat.{{sfn|ICTY|Nedeljko Dragani\u0107}} He described how Land\u017eo and three others tied his hands to a beam above his head and beat him with planks and rifle butts and kicked him until he lost consciousness. In the most egregious instance, Land\u017eo poured alcohol or petrol over him after ordering him to sit with his legs closed and then lit a match to set Dragani\u0107's legs on fire. \"[H]e did not allow me to put the fire out until it was put out by itself. [M]y trousers were completely burnt out and both my legs had burnt\", recalled Dragani\u0107 who did not receive immediate treatment for his burns, causing him to get an infection.{{sfn|ICTY|Nedeljko Dragani\u0107}} Another witness said that beatings were daily and that Deli\u0107 and Land\u017eo were the worst offenders.{{sfn|Vreme News Digest|2 April 1996}}\n\nDuring the trial, Land\u017eo eventually confessed to the beating and mistreatment of some of the prisoners as well as the murder of two of the five he was charged with, but stated that he could not remember the rest of the crimes.{{sfn|Institute for War and Peace Reporting|1 August 1998}} He insisted that the acts were done under the orders of camp superiors. He admitted among other things, to burning detainees on their arms or legs and forcing two brothers to perform [[fellatio]] on each other before tying slow-burning fuses to their genitals and liting them on fire.{{sfn|Institute for War and Peace Reporting|1 August 1998}} The trial chamber found that he beat an elderly man and nailed a Serbian Democratic Party badge to his forehead causing him to die from the injuries. He closed a pair of heated pincers against a detainee's tongue, burning his lips, mouth and tongue and then used the pincers to burn the detainee's ears. He cut off a prisoner's air supply using a gas mask and burned his hands, legs and thighs with a heated knife. He also forced a prisoner to do push-ups while kicking him and beating him with a baseball bat.{{sfn|ICTY|Case Information Sheet|p=2}}\n\n===Defence and sentencing===\nLand\u017eo claimed he took part in these acts because he wanted to be a \"perfect soldier\" and unquestioningly obey orders coming from the camp superiors (Deli\u0107 and Muci\u0107).{{sfn|Institute for War and Peace Reporting|1 August 1998}} Land\u017eo's lawyers argued that he suffered from a mental disorder that affected his sanity when he committed the crimes.{{sfn|Krzan|2016|p=88}} Since the ICTY tribunal assumes that perpetrators of human rights violations are healthy and mentally sound, the burden of proof rests on the side making the insanity plea.{{sfn|Krzan|2016|p=89}} Ultimately, the defence invoked rule 67 (A)(ii) of the ICTY rules of evidence and procedure to enter a \"diminished or lack of mental responsibility\" plea.{{sfn|Shniderman|Smith|2015|pp=19-20}} In contrast to an insanity plea, this recognized that the accused was aware of the wrongful nature of his actions but argued that due to the abnormality in the mind, he could not control them. The defence relied on the testimony of five psychiatrists who evaluated Land\u017eo and testified at the trial, yielding varying diagnoses.{{sfn|Shniderman|Smith|2015|p=20}} The court found Land\u017eo guilty, but took into account his young age, immature and fragile personality and mental state when considering his sentencing.{{sfn|Shniderman|Smith|2015|p=23}} On 16 November 1998, the First Trial Chamber found him guilty on 17 counts and sentenced him to 15 years in prison on the basis of his individual responsibility for:{{sfn|TRIAL International|Esad Landzo}}{{sfn|ICTY|16 November 1998|pp=447-449}}\n\n* Violations of the laws and customs of war (Art. 3 ICTY Statute): murder, cruel treatment, torture and pillage;\n* Serious breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions (Art. 2 ICTY Statute): wilful murder, torture, wilfully causing intense suffering or of inflicting serious bodily injury, and inhumane treatment\n\nOn 20 February 2001, Appeal judges quashed charges related to the violations of the laws and customs of war on the basis that they were cumulative and could not be judged on the basis of two separate articles.{{sfn|TRIAL International|Esad Landzo}} The same was applied to Deli\u0107 and Muci\u0107 who each received 20 and 7 years respectively while Delali\u0107 was previously acquitted.{{sfn|BBC News|20 February 2001}} On 9 October 2001, Land\u017eo's sentence of 15 years was reviewed and upheld.

He served under this capacity from the camp's establishment until it ceased operations, between May 1992 and December 1992, under the command of the camp's deputy commander [[Hazim Deli\u0107]] and commander Zdravko Muci\u0107. As a guard, Land\u017eo beat, tortured and murdered Serb prisoners.\n\nOn 21 March 1996, the ICTY indicted Land\u017eo, Deli\u0107, Muci\u0107 and Zejnil Delali\u0107 for crimes against humanity at the camp, charging Land\u017eo with the specific murders of five people, four instances of torture and one case of causing great suffering and serious injury. On 16 November 1998, Land\u017eo was found guilty of violations of the laws and customs of war and grave breaches of the [[Geneva conventions]] and sentenced to 15 years in prison. The sentence was later upheld upon appeal and Land\u017eo was granted early release on 13 April 2006 after serving nearly eight years of his sentence.\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|Bosnian War|\u010celebi\u0107i camp}}\nDuring the \u010celebi\u0107i trial, the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] established the importance of the [[Konjic]] municipality both historically and strategically. Because it lied on the fault line between areas Croats and Serbs considered to be within their spheres of influences, both ethnic groups had a vested geographical interest. More importantly, it was the site of an arms and munitions factory as well as being an important communications link between Mostar and Sarajevo due to its railway line and highway.{{sfn|ICTY|16 November 1998|pp=49-50}}{{sfn|TRIAL International|Esad Landzo}}\n\nAs Bosnia descended into war, Konjic was not immune to the tension and suspicion among the ethnic groups. On 17 April 1992, Serb representatives from Konjic's Municipal Assembly and Executive Council walked out following the recognition of [[1992 Bosnian independence referendum|Bosnia as an independent state]].{{sfn|ICTY|Crimes in \u010celebi\u0107i|p=1}} In the meantime, Muslim and Croat officials formed a War Presidency and an interim \"Crisis Staff\" to deal with the municipality's administration and defence. By mid-April 1992, Bosnian Serb forces had effectively surrounded the town of Konjic and cut it off from both [[Sarajevo]] and [[Mostar]].{{sfn|ICTY|Crimes in \u010celebi\u0107i|p=1}} Muslim and Croat forces began to arrive in the city of Konjic from surrounding villages, while Serb inhabitants moved to Serb-controlled villages. Konjic's defence forces\u2014which at the time consisted of the [[Territorial Defence Force of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Territorial Defence Force]] (TO), the local [[Croatian Army]] (HVO) and the [[Federal Ministry of Interior (Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Ministry of the Interior]] (MUP)\u2014attempted to negotiate with the principal representative of the Serbian people, the [[Serbian Democratic Party]] (SDS) but these apparent negotiations failed and a military campaign was launched.{{sfn|ICTY|Crimes in \u010celebi\u0107i|pp=1-2}}\n\nBeginning in late May 1992, Bosniak and Croat forces attacked and seized control of certain Serb majority villages in the municipality of Konjic.{{sfn|TRIAL International|Esad Landzo}} These operations resulted in the detainment of many members of the Serb population. A former JNA facility located on the outskirts of the village of [[\u010celebi\u0107i]] was chosen as the facility to house the prisoners.{{sfn|ICTY|Crimes in \u010celebi\u0107i|p=2}} The majority of the prisoners were men, captured during military operations in these villages, but also included some women who were housed separately.{{sfn|ICTY|Crimes in \u010celebi\u0107i|p=2}}{{sfn|ICTY|16 November 1998|p=60}} Detainees at the camp were subjected to murder, torture, sexual violence and otherwise cruel and inhumane treatment.{{sfn|ICTY|Crimes in \u010celebi\u0107i|p=1-7}}\n\n==Profile==\nEsad Land\u017eo, also named Zenga,{{sfn|ICTY|16 November 1998|p=1}} was born on 7 March 1973 in [[Glavati\u010devo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].{{sfn|ICTY|Case Information Sheet|p=3}} At the outset of the war, he joined the Bosnian Army and was assigned to be a guard at the \u010celebi\u0107i camp. He served in this capacity from May to December 1992{{sfn|ICTY|Case Information Sheet|p=2}} before joining the military police.{{sfn|Institute for War and Peace Reporting|1 August 1998}}\n\n==ICTY trial==\n===Indictment===\nOn 21 March 1996, The ICTY indicted Land\u017eo along with deputy commander [[Hazim Deli\u0107]], commander Zdravko Muci\u0107 and coordinator of joint Bosniak-Croat forces Zejnil Delali\u0107 for their roles in the crimes committed against Serbs at the camp.{{sfn|ICTY|Case Information Sheet|p=1-3}} Land\u017eo was charged with 11 counts of grave breaches of the [[Geneva conventions]] and 15 counts of violations of the laws and customs of war, which included five murders, four acts of torture and one case of causing great suffering and serious injury.{{sfn|ICTY|13 June 1996}} On 2 May 1996, Bosnian authorities arrested Land\u017eo and Deli\u0107{{sfn|ICTY|Case Information Sheet|p=3}} and transferred them to the ICTY on 13 June 1996.{{sfn|ICTY|13 June 1996}} Land\u017eo made his first court appearance on 18 June 1996 and pleaded not guilty to the 24 counts of charges.{{sfn|TRIAL International|Esad Landzo}} After a request for evaluation from the prosecution, the trial chamber found Land\u017eo fit to stand trial on 23 June 1997.{{sfn|ICTY|16 November 1998|p=15}}\n\n===Crimes===\nAs camp guard, it was found that Land\u017eo engaged in the abuse of prisoners by practicing torture, cruel treatment and murder.{{sfn|TRIAL International|Esad Landzo}} Nedeljko Dragani\u0107, a trial witness who was 19 at the time of his incarceration at the camp, described how he was beaten and tortured. Dragani\u0107 stated that Land\u017eo beat him almost every day, usually using a baseball bat.{{sfn|ICTY|Nedeljko Dragani\u0107}} He described how Land\u017eo and three others tied his hands to a beam above his head and beat him with planks and rifle butts and kicked him until he lost consciousness. In the most egregious instance, Land\u017eo poured alcohol or petrol over him after ordering him to sit with his legs closed and then lit a match to set Dragani\u0107's legs on fire. \"[H]e did not allow me to put the fire out until it was put out by itself. [M]y trousers were completely burnt out and both my legs had burnt\", recalled Dragani\u0107 who did not receive immediate treatment for his burns, causing him to get an infection.{{sfn|ICTY|Nedeljko Dragani\u0107}} Another witness said that beatings were daily and that Deli\u0107 and Land\u017eo were the worst offenders.{{sfn|Vreme News Digest|2 April 1996}}\n\nDuring the trial, Land\u017eo eventually confessed to the beating and mistreatment of some of the prisoners as well as the murder of two of the five he was charged with, but stated that he could not remember the rest of the crimes.{{sfn|Institute for War and Peace Reporting|1 August 1998}} He insisted that the acts were done under the orders of camp superiors. He admitted among other things, to burning detainees on their arms or legs and forcing two brothers to perform [[fellatio]] on each other before tying slow-burning fuses to their genitals and liting them on fire.{{sfn|Institute for War and Peace Reporting|1 August 1998}} The trial chamber found that he beat an elderly man and nailed a Serbian Democratic Party badge to his forehead causing him to die from the injuries. He closed a pair of heated pincers against a detainee's tongue, burning his lips, mouth and tongue and then used the pincers to burn the detainee's ears. He cut off a prisoner's air supply using a gas mask and burned his hands, legs and thighs with a heated knife. He also forced a prisoner to do push-ups while kicking him and beating him with a baseball bat.{{sfn|ICTY|Case Information Sheet|p=2}}\n\n===Defence and sentencing===\nLand\u017eo claimed he took part in these acts because he wanted to be a \"perfect soldier\" and unquestioningly obey orders coming from the camp superiors (Deli\u0107 and Muci\u0107).{{sfn|Institute for War and Peace Reporting|1 August 1998}} Land\u017eo's lawyers argued that he suffered from a mental disorder that affected his sanity when he committed the crimes.{{sfn|Krzan|2016|p=88}} Since the ICTY tribunal assumes that perpetrators of human rights violations are healthy and mentally sound, the burden of proof rests on the side making the insanity plea.{{sfn|Krzan|2016|p=89}} Ultimately, the defence invoked rule 67 (A)(ii) of the ICTY rules of evidence and procedure to enter a \"diminished or lack of mental responsibility\" plea.{{sfn|Shniderman|Smith|2015|pp=19-20}} In contrast to an insanity plea, this recognized that the accused was aware of the wrongful nature of his actions but argued that due to the abnormality in the mind, he could not control them. The defence relied on the testimony of five psychiatrists who evaluated Land\u017eo and testified at the trial, yielding varying diagnoses.{{sfn|Shniderman|Smith|2015|p=20}} The court found Land\u017eo guilty, but took into account his young age, immature and fragile personality and mental state when considering his sentencing.{{sfn|Shniderman|Smith|2015|p=23}} On 16 November 1998, the First Trial Chamber found him guilty on 17 counts and sentenced him to 15 years in prison on the basis of his individual responsibility for:{{sfn|TRIAL International|Esad Landzo}}{{sfn|ICTY|16 November 1998|pp=447-449}}\n\n* Violations of the laws and customs of war (Art. 3 ICTY Statute): murder, cruel treatment, torture and pillage;\n* Serious breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions (Art. 2 ICTY Statute): wilful murder, torture, wilfully causing intense suffering or of inflicting serious bodily injury, and inhumane treatment\n\nOn 20 February 2001, Appeal judges quashed charges related to the violations of the laws and customs of war on the basis that they were cumulative and could not be judged on the basis of two separate articles.{{sfn|TRIAL International|Esad Landzo}} The same was applied to Deli\u0107 and Muci\u0107 who each received 20 and 7 years respectively while Delali\u0107 was previously acquitted.{{sfn|BBC News|20 February 2001}} On 9 October 2001, Land\u017eo's sentence of 15 years was reviewed and upheld. On 8 April 2003, the sentence was upheld following an appeal.{{sfn|ICTY|Case Information Sheet|p=3}} He was transferred to Finland on 9 July 2003 to serve out the remainder of his sentence.{{sfn|TRIAL International|Esad Landzo}}\n\n===Release===\nOn 13 April 2006, he was granted early release which came into effect on 2 May 2006.{{sfn|ICTY|Case Information Sheet|p=3}}\n\n==Documentary==\nLand\u017eo is the subject of the 2017 documentary ''The Unforgiven'' directed by Lars Feldballe-Petersen which premiered at the [[Sarajevo Film Festival]]. In the film, Landzo seeks out former \u010celebi\u0107i prisoners he abused to apologize for his crimes.{{sfn|Balkan Insight|10 August 2017}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n;ICTY documents and reports\n{{refbegin|60em}}\n* {{cite web |ref={{harvid|ICTY|16 November 1998}} |title=Prosecutor v.

Sociolinguistically, it is two languages, Guajajara (Guazazzara) and Tembe, though these are mutually intelligible. Tembe was spoken by less than a quarter of its ethnic population of 820 in 2000; Guajajara, on the other hand, is more robust, being spoken by two thirds of its 20,000 people.\n\n== History ==\nTeneteh\u00e1ra speakers were first contacted in 1615 by a French expedition in the margins of the Pindar\u00e9 river. They clashed against slaver raids until Jesuit missions were set up among them (1653-1755). After the Jesuits were expelled from Brazil, the various Teneteh\u00e1ra groups went back to a life with very limited contact with the settler society.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century the members of the community started to be employed as collectors of natural resources. After some abuse by white settlers in their vicinity, in 1901 the Guajajara group revolted against a nearby Capuchin missions and expelled them from their land. They have been in continuous conflict with clandestine loggers and illegal settlements in their land.\n\n== Phonetics and phonology ==\nTeneteh\u00e1ra has a total of 21 phonemes: 14 consonants and 7 vowels.

Sociolinguistically, it is two languages, Guajajara (Guazazzara) and Tembe, though these are mutually intelligible. Tembe was spoken by less than a quarter of its ethnic population of 820 in 2000; Guajajara, on the other hand, is more robust, being spoken by two thirds of its 20,000 people.\n\n== History ==\nTeneteh\u00e1ra speakers were first contacted in 1615 by a French expedition in the margins of the Pindar\u00e9 river. They clashed against slaver raids until Jesuit missions were set up among them (1653-1755). After the Jesuits were expelled from Brazil, the various Teneteh\u00e1ra groups went back to a life with very limited contact with the settler society.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century the members of the community started to be employed as collectors of natural resources. After some abuse by white settlers in their vicinity, in 1901 the Guajajara group revolted against a nearby Capuchin missions and expelled them from their land. They have been in continuous conflict with clandestine loggers and illegal settlements in their land.\n\n== Phonetics and phonology ==\nTeneteh\u00e1ra has a total of 21 phonemes: 14 consonants and 7 vowels. Each of the consonantal phonemes occurs as the initial C in CV and CVC syllables, while each of the vowels occurs as the nucleus in the four syllable patterns. Any phoneme of the class /t k m n \u014b w z r/ may occur in the syllable and word final C position, while /p k<sup>w</sup> c \u014b<sup>w</sup> ' h/ are limited in their distribution in that they do not occur in the final C position.

The phrase about \"the valley of the shadow of death\" is often taken as an allusion to the eternal life given by Jesus.\n\n[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]]s typically include this Psalm in the prayers of preparation for receiving the [[Eucharist]].\n\nThe [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] inspired widespread efforts in western Europe to make biblical texts available in vernacular languages. One of the most popular early English versions was the [[Geneva Bible]] (1557). The most widely recognized version of the psalm in English today is undoubtedly the one drawn from the [[King James Bible]] (1611).\n\nIn the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], this psalm is sung as a responsorial in Masses for the dead.\n\nThe psalm is a popular passage for memorization and is often used in sermons.\n\n=== Metrical versions ===\n{{main|Metrical psalter}}\n[[File:Eastman Johnson, The Lord is My Shepherd.jpg|thumbnail|[[Eastman Johnson]]'s 1863 painting ''The Lord is My Shepherd''.]]\n\nAn early metrical version of the psalm in English was made in 1565 by [[Thomas Sternhold]].

Other tunes sometimes used include ''Belmont'', ''Evan'', ''Martyrdom'', ''Orlington'', and ''Wiltshire.''<ref>http://www.hymntime.com/tch/htm/l/m/lmysheph.htm{{dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Use in funerals ===\nIn the twentieth century, Psalm 23 became particularly associated with funeral liturgies in the English-speaking world, and films with funeral scenes often depict a graveside recitation of the psalm.  Official liturgies of English-speaking churches were slow to adopt this practice, though.  The [[Book of Common Prayer]] of the [[Church of England]] has only Psalms [[psalm 39|39]] and [[psalm 90|90]] in its order for the burial of the dead, and in the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] in the United States, Psalm 23 was not used for funerals until the 1928 revision of the prayer book.\n\n== Shepherd theme ==\n[[File:Corriedale lambs in Tierra del Fuego.JPG|thumb|Psalm 23 is often referred to as the Shepherd's psalm]]\nThe theme of God as a shepherd was common in ancient Israel and Mesopotamia. For example, [[King Hammurabi]], in the conclusion to his famous legal code, wrote: \"I am the shepherd who brings well-being and abundant prosperity; my rule is just.... so that the strong might not oppress the weak, and that even the orphan and the widow might be treated with justice.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/165hammurabi.html|title=Hammurabi's Code, circa 1780BC|website=history.hanover.edu|access-date=2017-12-12}}</ref> This imagery and language was well known to the community that created the Psalm, and was easily imported into its worship. \n\nPsalm 23 portrays God as a good [[shepherd]], feeding (verse 1) and leading (verse 3) his flock. The \"rod and staff\" (verse 4) are also the implements of a shepherd. Some commentators see the shepherd imagery pervading the entire psalm. It is known that the shepherd is to know each sheep by name, thus when God is given the analogy of a shepherd, he is not only a protector but also the caretaker. God, as the caretaker, leads the sheep to green pastures (verse 2) and still waters (verse 2) because he knows that each of his sheep must be personally led to be fed. Thus, without its Shepherd, the sheep would die either by a predator or of starvation, since sheep are known for their helplessness without their shepherd.\n\n[[J. Douglas MacMillan]] argues that verse 5 (\"Thou preparest a table before me\") refers to the \"old oriental shepherding practice\" of using little raised tables to feed sheep.<ref>[[J. Douglas MacMillan]], ''The Lord of Shepherd''. (Bryntirion: Evangelical Press of Wales, 1988), 78.</ref> Similarly, \"Thou anointest my head with oil\" may refer to an ancient form of [[Glossary of sheep husbandry|backliner]] \u2013 the oil is poured on wounds, and repels flies. MacMillan also notes that verse 6 (\"Goodness and mercy shall follow me\") reminds him of two loyal [[Herding dog|sheepdogs]] coming behind the flock.<ref> J. Douglas MacMillan, ''The Lord of Shepherd''. (Bryntirion: Evangelical Press of Wales, 1988), 82.</ref>\n\nJohn Ellinwood argues that in verses 4 and 5 King David acknowledges God's protection in expeditions and in battles. \"Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies\" refers to the sober raucous dinner before major battles. These were raucous in order to demoralize hostiles camped within earshot, and (only) the king ate from a table. \"Thou anointest my head with oil\" because tomorrow this ceremony might be impossible. After each victory there was no longer a need for sobriety, so \"my cup runneth over.\" The king's lyricist wisely shortened these military verses for balance. Also in Psalm 18 David mentions God's protection in battle. [13].\n\nThe first verse of the Psalm ascribes authorship to [[King David]], said in the [[Hebrew Scriptures]] to have been a field shepherd himself as a youth. However, some scholars do not believe that David could have written any of the Psalms.{{cn|date=June 2018}}\n\nTaken together, Psalm 22, 23 and 24, is seen by some as shepherd psalms, where the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep as suffering servant and king.<ref>http://www.plymouthbrethren.org/article/6484</ref>\n\n== Musical settings ==\n\n=== Liturgical and classical ===\n<!-- alphabetical by composer surname -->\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Bach: Cantata No.112 ''[[Der Herr ist mein getreuer Hirt, BWV 112]]''\n* [[James Leith Macbeth Bain]]: hymn tune ''Brother James' Air''\n* [[Ben Zion Shenker]]: Notable performance by [[Itzhak Perlman]] and Cantor [[Yitzchak Meir Helfgot]] <ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExF9-uFmLa8 Itzhak Perlman and Cantor Yitzchak Meir Helfgot perform Ben-Zion Shenker's Mizmor leDavid](YouTube).</ref>\n* [[Lennox Berkeley]]: Op. 91, No. 1 (1975)\n* Bernstein: ''[[Chichester Psalms]]'' (Hebrew, in Part 2, together with [[Psalm 2]])\n* Bruckner: [[Psalm 22 (Bruckner)|Psalm 22]] ''Der Herr regieret mich'' WAB 34 ({{circa|1852}})\n* [[Noah Creshevsky]]: ''Psalm XXIII'' (2003)\n* [[Paul Creston]]: ''Psalm XXIII'' (1945)\n* Dvo\u0159\u00e1k: verses 1\u20134, No. 4 of his ''[[Biblical Songs]]'' (1894)\n* Herbert Howells: ''[[Hymnus Paradisi]]''\n* [[Jessie Seymour Irvine]]: hymn tune ''Crimond''\n* Friedrich Kiel: verse 4 in No. 1 of his [[Six Motets, Op. 82 (Kiel)|Six Motets, Op. 82]]\n* [[Albert Hay Malotte#Songs, sacred and secular (incomplete; published)|Albert Hay Malotte]]\n* [[Cl\u00e9ment Marot]] (in Latin)\n* [[George Rochberg]]<ref>Together with [[Psalm 43]] and [[Psalm 150]] in an a capella setting for mixed chorus written in 1954.

The Book of Psalms is the third section of the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]],{{sfn|Mazor|2011|p=589}} and a book of the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Old Testament]]. In the Greek [[Septuagint]] version of the Bible, and in its Latin translation in the [[Vulgate]], this psalm is '''Psalm 22''' in a slightly different numbering system. In Latin, it is known by the [[incipit]], \"'''{{lang|la|Dominus reget me|italic=no}}'''\"<ref>[http://medievalist.net/psalmstxt/ps22.htm Parallel Latin/English Psalter / Psalmus 22 (23)] medievalist.net</ref>\n\nLike all psalms, Psalm 23 was used in worship by the ancient Hebrews. The writer describes God as his shepherd, in the role of protector and provider. The psalm is read, recited and sung by [[Jews]] and [[Christians]]. It has been called the best-known of the psalms for its universal theme of trust in God.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aish.com/sp/pg/48890772.html|title=The Lord is My Shepherd|first=Rebbetzin Tziporah|last=Heller|authorlink=Tziporah Heller|date=3 August 2002|accessdate=28 June 2018|work=Aish.com}}</ref>\n\n==Text==\n===Hebrew Bible version===\nFollowing is the Hebrew text of Psalm 23:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16244/jewish/Chapter-23.htm|title=Tehillim \u2013 Psalms \u2013 Chapter 23|publisher=[[Chabad|Chabad.org]]|year=2018|accessdate=29 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Other notable metrical versions include those by [[George Herbert]], [[Philip Sidney]], and [[Isaac Watts]].<ref name=\"smithcreekmusic.com\"/>\n\nA metrical version of the psalm is traditionally sung to the [[hymn tune]] ''Crimond'', generally attributed to [[Jessie Seymour Irvine]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://songsandhymns.org/hymns/tunes/detail/crimond\n|title=Crimond\n|publisher=Center for Church Music \u2013 Songs & Hymns\n|accessdate=2008-10-07}}</ref>  This version, with its opening words \"The Lord's My Shepherd\", is probably the best-known amongst English-speaking congregations.\nOther melodies, such as ''[[Brother James' Air]]'' or ''[[Amazing Grace]]'', are also used. Other tunes sometimes used include ''Belmont'', ''Evan'', ''Martyrdom'', ''Orlington'', and ''Wiltshire.''<ref>http://www.hymntime.com/tch/htm/l/m/lmysheph.htm{{dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Use in funerals ===\nIn the twentieth century, Psalm 23 became particularly associated with funeral liturgies in the English-speaking world, and films with funeral scenes often depict a graveside recitation of the psalm.  Official liturgies of English-speaking churches were slow to adopt this practice, though.  The [[Book of Common Prayer]] of the [[Church of England]] has only Psalms [[psalm 39|39]] and [[psalm 90|90]] in its order for the burial of the dead, and in the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] in the United States, Psalm 23 was not used for funerals until the 1928 revision of the prayer book.\n\n== Shepherd theme ==\n[[File:Corriedale lambs in Tierra del Fuego.JPG|thumb|Psalm 23 is often referred to as the Shepherd's psalm]]\nThe theme of God as a shepherd was common in ancient Israel and Mesopotamia. For example, [[King Hammurabi]], in the conclusion to his famous legal code, wrote: \"I am the shepherd who brings well-being and abundant prosperity; my rule is just.... so that the strong might not oppress the weak, and that even the orphan and the widow might be treated with justice.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/165hammurabi.html|title=Hammurabi's Code, circa 1780BC|website=history.hanover.edu|access-date=2017-12-12}}</ref> This imagery and language was well known to the community that created the Psalm, and was easily imported into its worship. \n\nPsalm 23 portrays God as a good [[shepherd]], feeding (verse 1) and leading (verse 3) his flock. The \"rod and staff\" (verse 4) are also the implements of a shepherd. Some commentators see the shepherd imagery pervading the entire psalm. It is known that the shepherd is to know each sheep by name, thus when God is given the analogy of a shepherd, he is not only a protector but also the caretaker. God, as the caretaker, leads the sheep to green pastures (verse 2) and still waters (verse 2) because he knows that each of his sheep must be personally led to be fed. Thus, without its Shepherd, the sheep would die either by a predator or of starvation, since sheep are known for their helplessness without their shepherd.\n\n[[J. Douglas MacMillan]] argues that verse 5 (\"Thou preparest a table before me\") refers to the \"old oriental shepherding practice\" of using little raised tables to feed sheep.<ref>[[J. Douglas MacMillan]], ''The Lord of Shepherd''. (Bryntirion: Evangelical Press of Wales, 1988), 78.</ref> Similarly, \"Thou anointest my head with oil\" may refer to an ancient form of [[Glossary of sheep husbandry|backliner]] \u2013 the oil is poured on wounds, and repels flies. MacMillan also notes that verse 6 (\"Goodness and mercy shall follow me\") reminds him of two loyal [[Herding dog|sheepdogs]] coming behind the flock.<ref> J. Douglas MacMillan, ''The Lord of Shepherd''. (Bryntirion: Evangelical Press of Wales, 1988), 82.</ref>\n\nJohn Ellinwood argues that in verses 4 and 5 King David acknowledges God's protection in expeditions and in battles. \"Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies\" refers to the sober raucous dinner before major battles. These were raucous in order to demoralize hostiles camped within earshot, and (only) the king ate from a table. \"Thou anointest my head with oil\" because tomorrow this ceremony might be impossible. After each victory there was no longer a need for sobriety, so \"my cup runneth over.\" The king's lyricist wisely shortened these military verses for balance. Also in Psalm 18 David mentions God's protection in battle. [13].\n\nThe first verse of the Psalm ascribes authorship to [[King David]], said in the [[Hebrew Scriptures]] to have been a field shepherd himself as a youth. However, some scholars do not believe that David could have written any of the Psalms.{{cn|date=June 2018}}\n\nTaken together, Psalm 22, 23 and 24, is seen by some as shepherd psalms, where the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep as suffering servant and king.<ref>http://www.plymouthbrethren.org/article/6484</ref>\n\n== Musical settings ==\n\n=== Liturgical and classical ===\n<!-- alphabetical by composer surname -->\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Bach: Cantata No.112 ''[[Der Herr ist mein getreuer Hirt, BWV 112]]''\n* [[James Leith Macbeth Bain]]: hymn tune ''Brother James' Air''\n* [[Ben Zion Shenker]]: Notable performance by [[Itzhak Perlman]] and Cantor [[Yitzchak Meir Helfgot]] <ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExF9-uFmLa8 Itzhak Perlman and Cantor Yitzchak Meir Helfgot perform Ben-Zion Shenker's Mizmor leDavid](YouTube).</ref>\n* [[Lennox Berkeley]]: Op. 91, No. 1 (1975)\n* Bernstein: ''[[Chichester Psalms]]'' (Hebrew, in Part 2, together with [[Psalm 2]])\n* Bruckner: [[Psalm 22 (Bruckner)|Psalm 22]] ''Der Herr regieret mich'' WAB 34 ({{circa|1852}})\n* [[Noah Creshevsky]]: ''Psalm XXIII'' (2003)\n* [[Paul Creston]]: ''Psalm XXIII'' (1945)\n* Dvo\u0159\u00e1k: verses 1\u20134, No. 4 of his ''[[Biblical Songs]]'' (1894)\n* Herbert Howells: ''[[Hymnus Paradisi]]''\n* [[Jessie Seymour Irvine]]: hymn tune ''Crimond''\n* Friedrich Kiel: verse 4 in No. 1 of his [[Six Motets, Op. 82 (Kiel)|Six Motets, Op. 82]]\n* [[Albert Hay Malotte#Songs, sacred and secular (incomplete; published)|Albert Hay Malotte]]\n* [[Cl\u00e9ment Marot]] (in Latin)\n* [[George Rochberg]]<ref>Together with [[Psalm 43]] and [[Psalm 150]] in an a capella setting for mixed chorus written in 1954.
