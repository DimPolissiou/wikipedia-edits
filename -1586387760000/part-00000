Several [[Latin-script alphabet]]s exist, which differ in graphemes, collation and phonetic values from the [[classical Latin alphabet]].\n\nThe Latin script is the basis of the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] and the 26 most widespread letters are the letters contained in the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]].\n\nLatin script is the basis for the largest number of alphabets of any [[writing system]]{{sfn|Haarmann|2004|p=96}} and is the\n[[List of writing systems by adoption|most widely adopted]] writing system in the world (commonly used by about 70 percent of the world's population).

Later, probably during the 3rd century BC, the letter {{angle bracket|Z}} \u2013 unneeded to write Latin properly \u2013 was replaced with the new letter {{angle bracket|G}}, a {{angle bracket|C}} modified with a small horizontal stroke, which took its place in the alphabet. From then on, {{angle bracket|G}} represented the [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] plosive {{IPA|/\u0261/}}, while {{angle bracket|C}} was generally reserved for the voiceless plosive {{IPA|/k/}}. The letter {{angle bracket|K}} was used only rarely, in a small number of words such as ''[[Kalends|Kalendae]]'', often interchangeably with {{angle bracket|C}}.\n\n===Classical Latin alphabet===\nAfter the [[Roman conquest of Greece]] in the 1st century BC, Latin adopted the Greek letters {{angle bracket|Y}} and {{angle bracket|Z}} (or readopted, in the latter case) to write [[Greek language|Greek]] loanwords, placing them at the end of the alphabet. An attempt by the emperor [[Claudius]] to introduce three [[Claudian letters|additional letters]] did not last.

[[W]] originated as a doubled [[V]] (VV) used to represent the sound {{IPA|[w]}} found in [[Old English]] as early as the 7th century. It came into common use in the later 11th century, replacing the runic [[Wynn]] letter which had been used for the same sound. In the Romance languages, the minuscule form of V was a rounded ''u''; from this was derived a rounded capital U for the vowel in the 16th century, while a new, pointed minuscule ''v'' was derived from V for the consonant. In the case of I, a word-final [[Swash (typography)|swash]] form, ''j'', came to be used for the consonant, with the un-swashed form restricted to vowel use. Such conventions were erratic for centuries. J was introduced into English for the consonant in the 17th century (it had been rare as a vowel), but it was not universally considered a distinct letter in the alphabetic order until the 19th century.\n\nBy the 1960s, it became apparent to the computer and [[telecommunication]]s industries in the [[First World]] that a non-proprietary method of encoding characters was needed. The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) encapsulated the Latin alphabet in their ([[ISO/IEC 646]]) standard. To achieve widespread acceptance, this encapsulation was based on popular usage. As the United States held a preeminent position in both industries during the 1960s, the standard was based on the already published ''American Standard Code for Information Interchange'', better known as [[ASCII]], which included in the [[Character encoding|character set]] the 26 \u00d7 2 (uppercase and lowercase) letters of the [[English alphabet]]. Later standards issued by the ISO, for example [[ISO/IEC 10646]] ([[Latin script in Unicode|Unicode Latin]]), have continued to define the 26 \u00d7 2 letters of the English alphabet as the basic Latin alphabet with extensions to handle other letters in other languages.\n\n== Spread ==\n[[File:Latin alphabet world distribution.svg|thumb|upright=2.05|The distribution of the Latin script. The dark green areas show the countries where the Latin script is the sole main script. Light green shows countries where Latin co-exists with other scripts. Latin-script alphabets are sometimes extensively used in areas coloured grey due to the use of unofficial second languages, such as French in Algeria and English in Egypt, and to Latin transliteration of the official script, such as [[pinyin]] in China.]]\n{{Main|Spread of the Latin script}}\nThe Latin alphabet spread, along with [[Latin]], from the [[Italian Peninsula]] to the lands surrounding the [[Mediterranean Sea]] with the expansion of the [[Roman Empire]]. The eastern half of the Empire, including [[Greece]], [[Turkey]], the [[Levant]], and [[Egypt]], continued to use [[Greek language|Greek]] as a [[lingua franca]], but Latin was widely spoken in the western half, and as the western [[Romance languages]] evolved out of Latin, they continued to use and adapt the Latin alphabet.\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nWith the spread of [[Western Christianity]] during the [[Middle Ages]], the Latin alphabet was gradually adopted by the peoples of [[Northern Europe]] who spoke [[Insular Celtic languages|Celtic languages]] (displacing the [[Ogham]] alphabet) or [[Germanic languages]] (displacing earlier [[Runic alphabet]]s) or [[Baltic languages]], as well as by the speakers of several [[Uralic languages]], most notably [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]].\n\nThe Latin script also came into use for writing the [[West Slavic languages]] and several [[South Slavic languages]], as the people who spoke them adopted [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]. The speakers of [[East Slavic languages]] generally adopted [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] along with [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]]. The [[Serbian language]] uses both scripts, with Cyrillic predominating in official communication and Latin elsewhere, as determined by the Law on Official Use of the Language and Alphabet.<ref name=\"ombudsman\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ombudsman.rs/pravamanjina/attachments/ZAKON%20o%20sluzbenoj%20upotrebi%20jezika%20i%20pisma.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714223400/http://www.ombudsman.rs/pravamanjina/attachments/ZAKON%20o%20sluzbenoj%20upotrebi%20jezika%20i%20pisma.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 July 2014 |date=17 May 2010 |title=Zakon O Slu\u017ebenoj Upotrebi Jezika I Pisama |publisher=Ombudsman.rs |accessdate=2014-07-05 }}</ref>\n\n=== Since the 16th century ===\nAs late as 1500, the Latin script was limited primarily to the languages spoken in [[Western Europe|Western]], [[Northern Europe|Northern]], and [[Central Europe]]. The [[Orthodox Christian]] Slavs of [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Southeastern Europe]] mostly used [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], and the Greek alphabet was in use by Greek-speakers around the eastern Mediterranean. The [[Arabic script]] was widespread within Islam, both among [[Arab]]s and non-Arab nations like the [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]], [[Ethnic groups in Indonesia|Indonesians]], [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], and [[Turkic peoples]]. Most of the rest of Asia used a variety of [[Brahmic family|Brahmic alphabets]] or the [[Chinese script]].\n\nThrough [[European colonization]] the Latin script has spread to the [[Americas]], [[Oceania]], parts of [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and the Pacific, in forms based on the [[Spanish alphabet|Spanish]], [[Portuguese alphabet|Portuguese]], [[English alphabet|English]], [[French alphabet|French]], [[German alphabet|German]] and [[Dutch alphabet|Dutch]] alphabets.\n\nIt is used for many [[Austronesian languages]], including the [[languages of the Philippines]] and the [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]] and [[Indonesian language]]s, replacing earlier Arabic and indigenous Brahmic alphabets. Latin letters served as the basis for the forms of the [[Cherokee syllabary]] developed by [[Sequoyah]]; however, the sound values are completely different.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n=== Since 19th century ===\nIn the late 19th century, the [[Romanians]] returned to the Latin alphabet, which they had used until the [[Council of Florence]] in 1439,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Descriptio_Moldaviae#CAPUT_V_-_DE_LITTERIS_MOLDAVORUM |date=1714 |title=Descriptio_Moldaviae |publisher=La.wikisource.org |accessdate=2014-09-14}}</ref> primarily because [[Romanian language|Romanian]] is a [[Romance language]]. The Romanians were predominantly [[Orthodox Christian]]s, and their Church, increasingly influenced by Russia after the [[Fall of Constantinople|fall of Byzantine Greek Constantinople]] in 1453 and capture of the Greek [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Orthodox Patriarch]], had begun promoting the Slavic [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]].\n\nUnder French rule and Portuguese missionary influence, a Latin alphabet was devised for the [[Vietnamese language]], which had previously used [[Chu nom|Chinese characters]].\n\n=== Since 20th century ===\nIn 1928, as part of [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]]'s reforms, the new [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]] adopted a Latin alphabet for the [[Turkish language]], replacing a modified Arabic alphabet. Most of the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking peoples of the former [[Soviet Union|USSR]], including [[Tatars]], [[Bashkirs]], [[Azeri]], [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]], [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] and others, used the Latin-based [[Uniform Turkic alphabet]] in the 1930s; but, in the 1940s, all were replaced by Cyrillic. In 2017 Kazakhstan adopted the Latin script as their second official script replacing Cyrillic by 2025.\n\nAfter the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, three of the newly independent Turkic-speaking republics, [[Azerbaijan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Kazakhstan]] as well as Romanian-speaking [[Moldova]], officially adopted Latin alphabets for their languages. [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Iranian languages|Iranian]]-speaking [[Tajikistan]], and the breakaway region of [[Transnistria]] kept the Cyrillic alphabet, chiefly due to their close ties with Russia.\n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, the majority of [[Kurds]] replaced the Arabic script with two Latin alphabets. Although the only official [[Kurdistan Regional Government|Kurdish government]] uses an Arabic alphabet for public documents, the Latin Kurdish alphabet remains widely used throughout the region by the majority of [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]-speakers.\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2015, the [[government of Kazakhstan]] announced that a [[Kazakh alphabets#Latin script|Kazakh Latin alphabet]] would replace the [[Kazakh alphabets#Cyrillic script|Kazakh Cyrillic alphabet]] as the official writing system for the [[Kazakh language]] by 2025.<ref>[http://www.inform.kz/eng/article/2741711 Kazakh language to be converted to Latin alphabet \u2013 MCS RK].

The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) encapsulated the Latin alphabet in their ([[ISO/IEC 646]]) standard. To achieve widespread acceptance, this encapsulation was based on popular usage.\n\nAs the United States held a preeminent position in both industries during the 1960s, the standard was based on the already published ''American Standard Code for Information Interchange'', better known as [[ASCII]], which included in the [[Character encoding|character set]] the 26 \u00d7 2 (uppercase and lowercase) letters of the [[English alphabet]]. Later standards issued by the ISO, for example [[ISO/IEC 10646]] ([[Latin characters in Unicode|Unicode Latin]]), have continued to define the 26 \u00d7 2 letters of the English alphabet as the basic Latin alphabet with extensions to handle other letters in other languages.\n\n== As used by various languages ==\n{{Main|Latin-script alphabet}}\nIn the course of its use, the Latin alphabet was adapted for use in new languages, sometimes representing [[phoneme]]s not found in languages that were already written with the Roman characters. To represent these new sounds, extensions were therefore created, be it by adding [[diacritic]]s to existing [[letter (alphabet)|letters]], by joining multiple letters together to make [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]], by creating completely new forms, or by assigning a special function to pairs or triplets of letters. These new forms are given a place in the alphabet by defining an [[collation|alphabetical order]] or collation sequence, which can vary with the particular language.\n\n=== Letters ===\n{{Main list|List of Latin-script letters}}\n\nSome examples of new letters to the standard Latin alphabet are the [[Runic alphabet|Runic]] letters [[wynn]] {{angle bracket|\u01f7/\u01bf}} and [[thorn (letter)|thorn]] {{angle bracket|\u00de/\u00fe}}, and the letter [[eth]] {{angle bracket|\u00d0/\u00f0}}, which were added to the alphabet of [[Old English language|Old English]]. Another Irish letter, the [[Insular G|insular ''g'']], developed into [[yogh]] {{angle bracket|\u021c/\u021d}}, used in [[Middle English]]. Wynn was later replaced with the new letter {{angle bracket|w}}, eth and thorn with {{angle bracket|[[Pronunciation of English th|th]]}}, and yogh with {{angle bracket|[[Gh (digraph)|gh]]}}. Although the four are no longer part of the English or Irish alphabets, eth and thorn are still used in the modern [[Icelandic orthography|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese alphabet]]s.\n\nSome West, Central and [[Southern Africa]]n languages use a few additional letters that have a similar sound value to their equivalents in the IPA. For example, [[Adangme language|Adangme]] uses the letters {{angle bracket|\u0190/\u025b}} and {{angle bracket|\u0186/\u0254}}, and [[Ga language|Ga]] uses {{angle bracket|\u0190/\u025b}}, {{angle bracket|\u014a/\u014b}} and {{angle bracket|\u0186/\u0254}}. [[Hausa language|Hausa]] uses {{angle bracket|\u0181/\u0253}} and {{angle bracket|\u018a/\u0257}} for [[implosive consonant|implosives]], and {{angle bracket|\u0198/\u0199}} for an [[ejective consonant|ejective]]. [[African studies|Africanists]] have standardized these into the [[African reference alphabet]].\n\nThe [[Azerbaijani language]] also has the letter written as \"\u018f\", which represents the [[near-open front unrounded vowel]].\n\n=== Multigraphs ===\n{{Main|Latin-script multigraph}}\nA [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] is a pair of letters used to write one sound or a combination of sounds that does not correspond to the written letters in sequence. Examples are {{angle bracket|[[Ch (digraph)|ch]]}}, {{angle bracket|[[Eng (letter)|ng]]}}, {{angle bracket|[[Rh (digraph)|rh]]}}, {{angle bracket|[[Sh (digraph)|sh]]}} in English, and {{angle bracket|[[IJ (digraph)|ij]]}} in Dutch. In Dutch the {{angle bracket|ij}} is capitalized as {{angle bracket|IJ}} or the [[Ligature (typography)|ligature]] {{angle bracket|\u0132}}, but never as {{angle bracket|Ij}}, and it often takes the appearance of a ligature {{angle bracket|\u0133}} very similar to the letter {{angle bracket|\u00ff}} in [[handwriting]].\n\nA [[trigraph (orthography)|trigraph]] is made up of three letters, like the [[German language|German]] {{angle bracket|[[Sch (trigraph)|sch]]}}, the [[Breton language|Breton]] {{angle bracket|[[C'h (trigraph)|c'h]]}} or the [[Milanese]] {{angle bracket|oeu}}. In the [[orthography|orthographies]] of some languages, digraphs and trigraphs are regarded as independent letters of the alphabet in their own right. The capitalization of digraphs and trigraphs is language-dependent, as only the first letter may be capitalized, or all component letters simultaneously (even for words written in titlecase, where letters after the digraph or trigraph are left in lowercase).\n\n=== Ligatures ===\n{{Main|Ligature (typography)}}\nA [[ligature (typography)|ligature]] is a fusion of two or more ordinary letters into a new [[glyph]] or character. Examples are {{angle bracket|[[\u00c6]]/\u00e6}} (from {{angle bracket|AE}}, called \"ash\"), {{angle bracket|[[\u0152]]/\u0153}} (from {{angle bracket|OE}}, sometimes called \"oethel\"), the [[abbreviation]] {{angle bracket|[[&]]}} (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''et'' \"and\"), and the [[German language|German]] symbol {{angle bracket|[[\u00df]]}} (\"sharp S\" or \"eszet\", from {{angle bracket|\u017fz}} or {{angle bracket|\u017fs}}, the [[Long s|archaic medial form of {{angle bracket|s}}]], followed by a {{angle bracket|z}} or {{angle bracket|s}}).\n\n=== Diacritics ===\n[[File:Small a with acute.svg|thumb|upright=0.25|The letter {{angle bracket|[[a]]}} with an [[acute accent|acute]] [[diacritic]]]]\n{{Main|Diacritic}}\n\nA diacritic, in some cases also called an accent, is a small symbol that can appear above or below a letter, or in some other position, such as the [[umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut sign]] used in the German characters {{angle bracket|[[\u00e4]]}}, {{angle bracket|[[\u00f6]]}}, {{angle bracket|[[\u00fc]]}} or the Romanian characters [[\u0103]], [[\u00e2]], [[\u00ee]], [[S-comma|\u0219]], [[T-comma|\u021b]]. Its main function is to change the phonetic value of the letter to which it is added, but it may also modify the pronunciation of a whole syllable or word, or distinguish between [[homonym|homographs]] (such as the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] words ''[[wikt:een|een]]'' meaning \"a\" or \"an\", and ''[[wikt:\u00e9\u00e9n|\u00e9\u00e9n]]'', meaning \"one\"). As with letters, the value of diacritics is language-dependent.\n\nEnglish is the only major modern [[Languages of Europe|European language]] requiring no diacritics for native words (although a [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] may be used in words such as \"co\u00f6peration\").{{NoteTag|As an example, an article containing a [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] in \"co\u00f6perate\" and a [[cedilla]] in \"fa\u00e7ades\" as well as a [[circumflex]] in the word \"cr\u00eape\": {{cite magazine |first = Anthony |last = Grafton |url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/10/23/061023crbo_books?currentPage=all |title = Books: The Nutty Professors, The history of academic charisma |date = 2006-10-23 |magazine = [[The New Yorker]] }}}}<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20101216160024/http://dscriber.com/news/121-the-new-yorkers-odd-mark-the-diaeresis \"The New Yorker's odd mark{{snd}}the diaeresis\"]</ref>\n\n=== Collation ===\n{{Main|Collating sequence}}\n\nSome modified letters, such as the symbols {{angle bracket|[[\u00e5]]}}, {{angle bracket|[[\u00e4]]}}, and {{angle bracket|[[\u00f6]]}}, may be regarded as new individual letters in themselves, and assigned a specific place in the alphabet for [[collation]] purposes, separate from that of the letter on which they are based, as is done in [[Swedish alphabet|Swedish]]. In other cases, such as with {{angle bracket|[[\u00e4]]}}, {{angle bracket|[[\u00f6]]}}, {{angle bracket|[[\u00fc]]}} in German, this is not done; letter-diacritic combinations being identified with their base letter. The same applies to digraphs and trigraphs. Different diacritics may be treated differently in collation within a single language. For example, in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], the character {{angle bracket|[[\u00f1]]}} is considered a letter, and sorted between {{angle bracket|[[n]]}} and {{angle bracket|[[o]]}} in dictionaries, but the accented vowels {{angle bracket|[[\u00e1]]}}, {{angle bracket|[[\u00e9]]}}, {{angle bracket|[[\u00ed]]}}, {{angle bracket|[[\u00f3]]}}, {{angle bracket|[[\u00fa]]}} are not separated from the unaccented vowels {{angle bracket|[[a]]}}, {{angle bracket|[[e]]}}, {{angle bracket|[[i]]}}, {{angle bracket|[[o]]}}, {{angle bracket|[[u]]}}.\n\n=== Capitalization ===\n{{main|Letter case}}\nThe languages that use the Latin script today generally use [[capital letters]] to begin paragraphs and sentences and [[Noun#Proper nouns and common nouns|proper nouns]]. The rules for [[capitalization]] have changed over time, and different languages have varied in their rules for capitalization. [[Old English language|Old English]], for example, was rarely written with even proper nouns capitalized; whereas [[Modern English]] of the 18th century had frequently all nouns capitalized, in the same way that Modern [[German language|German]] is written today, e.g. {{lang|de|Alle Schwestern der alten Stadt hatten die V\u00f6gel gesehen}} (\"All of the sisters of the old city had seen the birds\").\n\n== Romanization ==\n{{Main|Romanization}}\n\nWords from languages natively written with other [[Writing system|scripts]], such as [[Romanization of Arabic|Arabic]] or [[Romanization of Chinese|Chinese]], are usually [[transliteration|transliterated]] or [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]] when embedded in Latin-script text or in [[Multilingualism|multilingual]] international communication, a process termed Romanization.\n\nWhilst the Romanization of such languages is used mostly at unofficial levels, it has been especially prominent in computer messaging where only the limited 7-bit [[ASCII]] code is available on older systems. However, with the introduction of [[Unicode]], Romanization is now becoming less necessary. Note that keyboards used to enter such text may still restrict users to Romanized text, as only ASCII or Latin-alphabet characters may be available.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Romic alphabet]]\n* [[List of languages by writing system#Latin script]]\n* [[Western Latin character sets (computing)]]\n* [[Latin letters used in mathematics]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last = Haarmann |first = Harald |title = Geschichte der Schrift |trans-title = History of Writing |language = de |publisher = C.

Several [[Latin-script alphabet]]s exist, which differ in graphemes, collation and phonetic values from the [[classical Latin alphabet]].\n\nThe Latin script is the basis of the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] and the 26 most widespread letters are the letters contained in the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]].\n\nLatin script is the basis for the largest number of alphabets of any [[writing system]]{{sfn|Haarmann|2004|p=96}} and is the\n[[List of writing systems by adoption|most widely adopted]] writing system in the world (commonly used by about 70 percent of the world's population).

Later, probably during the 3rd century BC, the letter {{angle bracket|Z}} \u2013 unneeded to write Latin properly \u2013 was replaced with the new letter {{angle bracket|G}}, a {{angle bracket|C}} modified with a small horizontal stroke, which took its place in the alphabet. From then on, {{angle bracket|G}} represented the [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] plosive {{IPA|/\u0261/}}, while {{angle bracket|C}} was generally reserved for the voiceless plosive {{IPA|/k/}}. The letter {{angle bracket|K}} was used only rarely, in a small number of words such as ''[[Kalends|Kalendae]]'', often interchangeably with {{angle bracket|C}}.\n\n===Classical Latin alphabet===\nAfter the [[Roman conquest of Greece]] in the 1st century BC, Latin adopted the Greek letters {{angle bracket|Y}} and {{angle bracket|Z}} (or readopted, in the latter case) to write [[Greek language|Greek]] loanwords, placing them at the end of the alphabet. An attempt by the emperor [[Claudius]] to introduce three [[Claudian letters|additional letters]] did not last. Thus it was during the [[classical Latin]] period that the Latin alphabet contained 23 letters:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ [[Classical Latin alphabet]]\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left\" | Letter\n!

[[W]] originated as a doubled [[V]] (VV) used to represent the sound {{IPA|[w]}} found in [[Old English]] as early as the 7th century. It came into common use in the later 11th century, replacing the runic [[Wynn]] letter which had been used for the same sound. In the Romance languages, the minuscule form of V was a rounded ''u''; from this was derived a rounded capital U for the vowel in the 16th century, while a new, pointed minuscule ''v'' was derived from V for the consonant. In the case of I, a word-final [[Swash (typography)|swash]] form, ''j'', came to be used for the consonant, with the un-swashed form restricted to vowel use. Such conventions were erratic for centuries. J was introduced into English for the consonant in the 17th century (it had been rare as a vowel), but it was not universally considered a distinct letter in the alphabetic order until the 19th century.\n\nBy the 1960s, it became apparent to the computer and [[telecommunication]]s industries in the [[First World]] that a non-proprietary method of encoding characters was needed. The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) encapsulated the Latin alphabet in their ([[ISO/IEC 646]]) standard. To achieve widespread acceptance, this encapsulation was based on popular usage. As the United States held a preeminent position in both industries during the 1960s, the standard was based on the already published ''American Standard Code for Information Interchange'', better known as [[ASCII]], which included in the [[Character encoding|character set]] the 26 \u00d7 2 (uppercase and lowercase) letters of the [[English alphabet]]. Later standards issued by the ISO, for example [[ISO/IEC 10646]] ([[Latin script in Unicode|Unicode Latin]]), have continued to define the 26 \u00d7 2 letters of the English alphabet as the basic Latin alphabet with extensions to handle other letters in other languages.\n\n== Spread ==\n[[File:Latin alphabet world distribution.svg|thumb|upright=2.05|The distribution of the Latin script. The dark green areas show the countries where the Latin script is the sole main script. Light green shows countries where Latin co-exists with other scripts. Latin-script alphabets are sometimes extensively used in areas coloured grey due to the use of unofficial second languages, such as French in Algeria and English in Egypt, and to Latin transliteration of the official script, such as [[pinyin]] in China.]]\n{{Main|Spread of the Latin script}}\nThe Latin alphabet spread, along with [[Latin]], from the [[Italian Peninsula]] to the lands surrounding the [[Mediterranean Sea]] with the expansion of the [[Roman Empire]]. The eastern half of the Empire, including [[Greece]], [[Turkey]], the [[Levant]], and [[Egypt]], continued to use [[Greek language|Greek]] as a [[lingua franca]], but Latin was widely spoken in the western half, and as the western [[Romance languages]] evolved out of Latin, they continued to use and adapt the Latin alphabet.\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nWith the spread of [[Western Christianity]] during the [[Middle Ages]], the Latin alphabet was gradually adopted by the peoples of [[Northern Europe]] who spoke [[Insular Celtic languages|Celtic languages]] (displacing the [[Ogham]] alphabet) or [[Germanic languages]] (displacing earlier [[Runic alphabet]]s) or [[Baltic languages]], as well as by the speakers of several [[Uralic languages]], most notably [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]].\n\nThe Latin script also came into use for writing the [[West Slavic languages]] and several [[South Slavic languages]], as the people who spoke them adopted [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]. The speakers of [[East Slavic languages]] generally adopted [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] along with [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]]. The [[Serbian language]] uses both scripts, with Cyrillic predominating in official communication and Latin elsewhere, as determined by the Law on Official Use of the Language and Alphabet.<ref name=\"ombudsman\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ombudsman.rs/pravamanjina/attachments/ZAKON%20o%20sluzbenoj%20upotrebi%20jezika%20i%20pisma.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714223400/http://www.ombudsman.rs/pravamanjina/attachments/ZAKON%20o%20sluzbenoj%20upotrebi%20jezika%20i%20pisma.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 July 2014 |date=17 May 2010 |title=Zakon O Slu\u017ebenoj Upotrebi Jezika I Pisama |publisher=Ombudsman.rs |accessdate=2014-07-05 }}</ref>\n\n=== Since the 16th century ===\nAs late as 1500, the Latin script was limited primarily to the languages spoken in [[Western Europe|Western]], [[Northern Europe|Northern]], and [[Central Europe]]. The [[Orthodox Christian]] Slavs of [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Southeastern Europe]] mostly used [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], and the Greek alphabet was in use by Greek-speakers around the eastern Mediterranean. The [[Arabic script]] was widespread within Islam, both among [[Arab]]s and non-Arab nations like the [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]], [[Ethnic groups in Indonesia|Indonesians]], [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], and [[Turkic peoples]]. Most of the rest of Asia used a variety of [[Brahmic family|Brahmic alphabets]] or the [[Chinese script]].\n\nThrough [[European colonization]] the Latin script has spread to the [[Americas]], [[Oceania]], parts of [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and the Pacific, in forms based on the [[Spanish alphabet|Spanish]], [[Portuguese alphabet|Portuguese]], [[English alphabet|English]], [[French alphabet|French]], [[German alphabet|German]] and [[Dutch alphabet|Dutch]] alphabets.\n\nIt is used for many [[Austronesian languages]], including the [[languages of the Philippines]] and the [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]] and [[Indonesian language]]s, replacing earlier Arabic and indigenous Brahmic alphabets. Latin letters served as the basis for the forms of the [[Cherokee syllabary]] developed by [[Sequoyah]]; however, the sound values are completely different.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n=== Since 19th century ===\nIn the late 19th century, the [[Romanians]] returned to the Latin alphabet, which they had used until the [[Council of Florence]] in 1439,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Descriptio_Moldaviae#CAPUT_V_-_DE_LITTERIS_MOLDAVORUM |date=1714 |title=Descriptio_Moldaviae |publisher=La.wikisource.org |accessdate=2014-09-14}}</ref> primarily because [[Romanian language|Romanian]] is a [[Romance language]]. The Romanians were predominantly [[Orthodox Christian]]s, and their Church, increasingly influenced by Russia after the [[Fall of Constantinople|fall of Byzantine Greek Constantinople]] in 1453 and capture of the Greek [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Orthodox Patriarch]], had begun promoting the Slavic [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]].\n\nUnder French rule and Portuguese missionary influence, a Latin alphabet was devised for the [[Vietnamese language]], which had previously used [[Chu nom|Chinese characters]].\n\n=== Since 20th century ===\nIn 1928, as part of [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]]'s reforms, the new [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]] adopted a Latin alphabet for the [[Turkish language]], replacing a modified Arabic alphabet. Most of the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking peoples of the former [[Soviet Union|USSR]], including [[Tatars]], [[Bashkirs]], [[Azeri]], [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]], [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] and others, used the Latin-based [[Uniform Turkic alphabet]] in the 1930s; but, in the 1940s, all were replaced by Cyrillic. In 2017 Kazakhstan adopted the Latin script as their second official script replacing Cyrillic by 2025.\n\nAfter the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, three of the newly independent Turkic-speaking republics, [[Azerbaijan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Kazakhstan]] as well as Romanian-speaking [[Moldova]], officially adopted Latin alphabets for their languages. [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Iranian languages|Iranian]]-speaking [[Tajikistan]], and the breakaway region of [[Transnistria]] kept the Cyrillic alphabet, chiefly due to their close ties with Russia.\n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, the majority of [[Kurds]] replaced the Arabic script with two Latin alphabets. Although the only official [[Kurdistan Regional Government|Kurdish government]] uses an Arabic alphabet for public documents, the Latin Kurdish alphabet remains widely used throughout the region by the majority of [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]-speakers.\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2015, the [[government of Kazakhstan]] announced that a [[Kazakh alphabets#Latin script|Kazakh Latin alphabet]] would replace the [[Kazakh alphabets#Cyrillic script|Kazakh Cyrillic alphabet]] as the official writing system for the [[Kazakh language]] by 2025.<ref>[http://www.inform.kz/eng/article/2741711 Kazakh language to be converted to Latin alphabet \u2013 MCS RK].

The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) encapsulated the Latin alphabet in their ([[ISO/IEC 646]]) standard. To achieve widespread acceptance, this encapsulation was based on popular usage.\n\nAs the United States held a preeminent position in both industries during the 1960s, the standard was based on the already published ''American Standard Code for Information Interchange'', better known as [[ASCII]], which included in the [[Character encoding|character set]] the 26 \u00d7 2 (uppercase and lowercase) letters of the [[English alphabet]]. Later standards issued by the ISO, for example [[ISO/IEC 10646]] ([[Latin characters in Unicode|Unicode Latin]]), have continued to define the 26 \u00d7 2 letters of the English alphabet as the basic Latin alphabet with extensions to handle other letters in other languages.\n\n== As used by various languages ==\n{{Main|Latin-script alphabet}}\nIn the course of its use, the Latin alphabet was adapted for use in new languages, sometimes representing [[phoneme]]s not found in languages that were already written with the Roman characters. To represent these new sounds, extensions were therefore created, be it by adding [[diacritic]]s to existing [[letter (alphabet)|letters]], by joining multiple letters together to make [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]], by creating completely new forms, or by assigning a special function to pairs or triplets of letters. These new forms are given a place in the alphabet by defining an [[collation|alphabetical order]] or collation sequence, which can vary with the particular language.\n\n=== Letters ===\n{{Main list|List of Latin-script letters}}\n\nSome examples of new letters to the standard Latin alphabet are the [[Runic alphabet|Runic]] letters [[wynn]] {{angle bracket|\u01f7/\u01bf}} and [[thorn (letter)|thorn]] {{angle bracket|\u00de/\u00fe}}, and the letter [[eth]] {{angle bracket|\u00d0/\u00f0}}, which were added to the alphabet of [[Old English language|Old English]]. Another Irish letter, the [[Insular G|insular ''g'']], developed into [[yogh]] {{angle bracket|\u021c/\u021d}}, used in [[Middle English]]. Wynn was later replaced with the new letter {{angle bracket|w}}, eth and thorn with {{angle bracket|[[Pronunciation of English th|th]]}}, and yogh with {{angle bracket|[[Gh (digraph)|gh]]}}. Although the four are no longer part of the English or Irish alphabets, eth and thorn are still used in the modern [[Icelandic orthography|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese alphabet]]s.\n\nSome West, Central and [[Southern Africa]]n languages use a few additional letters that have a similar sound value to their equivalents in the IPA. For example, [[Adangme language|Adangme]] uses the letters {{angle bracket|\u0190/\u025b}} and {{angle bracket|\u0186/\u0254}}, and [[Ga language|Ga]] uses {{angle bracket|\u0190/\u025b}}, {{angle bracket|\u014a/\u014b}} and {{angle bracket|\u0186/\u0254}}. [[Hausa language|Hausa]] uses {{angle bracket|\u0181/\u0253}} and {{angle bracket|\u018a/\u0257}} for [[implosive consonant|implosives]], and {{angle bracket|\u0198/\u0199}} for an [[ejective consonant|ejective]]. [[African studies|Africanists]] have standardized these into the [[African reference alphabet]].\n\nThe [[Azerbaijani language]] also has the letter written as \"\u018f\", which represents the [[near-open front unrounded vowel]].\n\n=== Multigraphs ===\n{{Main|Latin-script multigraph}}\nA [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] is a pair of letters used to write one sound or a combination of sounds that does not correspond to the written letters in sequence. Examples are {{angle bracket|[[Ch (digraph)|ch]]}}, {{angle bracket|[[Eng (letter)|ng]]}}, {{angle bracket|[[Rh (digraph)|rh]]}}, {{angle bracket|[[Sh (digraph)|sh]]}} in English, and {{angle bracket|[[IJ (digraph)|ij]]}} in Dutch. In Dutch the {{angle bracket|ij}} is capitalized as {{angle bracket|IJ}} or the [[Ligature (typography)|ligature]] {{angle bracket|\u0132}}, but never as {{angle bracket|Ij}}, and it often takes the appearance of a ligature {{angle bracket|\u0133}} very similar to the letter {{angle bracket|\u00ff}} in [[handwriting]].\n\nA [[trigraph (orthography)|trigraph]] is made up of three letters, like the [[German language|German]] {{angle bracket|[[Sch (trigraph)|sch]]}}, the [[Breton language|Breton]] {{angle bracket|[[C'h (trigraph)|c'h]]}} or the [[Milanese]] {{angle bracket|oeu}}. In the [[orthography|orthographies]] of some languages, digraphs and trigraphs are regarded as independent letters of the alphabet in their own right. The capitalization of digraphs and trigraphs is language-dependent, as only the first letter may be capitalized, or all component letters simultaneously (even for words written in titlecase, where letters after the digraph or trigraph are left in lowercase).\n\n=== Ligatures ===\n{{Main|Ligature (typography)}}\nA [[ligature (typography)|ligature]] is a fusion of two or more ordinary letters into a new [[glyph]] or character. Examples are {{angle bracket|[[\u00c6]]/\u00e6}} (from {{angle bracket|AE}}, called \"ash\"), {{angle bracket|[[\u0152]]/\u0153}} (from {{angle bracket|OE}}, sometimes called \"oethel\"), the [[abbreviation]] {{angle bracket|[[&]]}} (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''et'' \"and\"), and the [[German language|German]] symbol {{angle bracket|[[\u00df]]}} (\"sharp S\" or \"eszet\", from {{angle bracket|\u017fz}} or {{angle bracket|\u017fs}}, the [[Long s|archaic medial form of {{angle bracket|s}}]], followed by a {{angle bracket|z}} or {{angle bracket|s}}).\n\n=== Diacritics ===\n[[File:Small a with acute.svg|thumb|upright=0.25|The letter {{angle bracket|[[a]]}} with an [[acute accent|acute]] [[diacritic]]]]\n{{Main|Diacritic}}\n\nA diacritic, in some cases also called an accent, is a small symbol that can appear above or below a letter, or in some other position, such as the [[umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut sign]] used in the German characters {{angle bracket|[[\u00e4]]}}, {{angle bracket|[[\u00f6]]}}, {{angle bracket|[[\u00fc]]}} or the Romanian characters [[\u0103]], [[\u00e2]], [[\u00ee]], [[S-comma|\u0219]], [[T-comma|\u021b]]. Its main function is to change the phonetic value of the letter to which it is added, but it may also modify the pronunciation of a whole syllable or word, or distinguish between [[homonym|homographs]] (such as the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] words ''[[wikt:een|een]]'' meaning \"a\" or \"an\", and ''[[wikt:\u00e9\u00e9n|\u00e9\u00e9n]]'', meaning \"one\"). As with letters, the value of diacritics is language-dependent.\n\nEnglish is the only major modern [[Languages of Europe|European language]] requiring no diacritics for native words (although a [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] may be used in words such as \"co\u00f6peration\").{{NoteTag|As an example, an article containing a [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] in \"co\u00f6perate\" and a [[cedilla]] in \"fa\u00e7ades\" as well as a [[circumflex]] in the word \"cr\u00eape\": {{cite magazine |first = Anthony |last = Grafton |url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/10/23/061023crbo_books?currentPage=all |title = Books: The Nutty Professors, The history of academic charisma |date = 2006-10-23 |magazine = [[The New Yorker]] }}}}<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20101216160024/http://dscriber.com/news/121-the-new-yorkers-odd-mark-the-diaeresis \"The New Yorker's odd mark{{snd}}the diaeresis\"]</ref>\n\n=== Collation ===\n{{Main|Collating sequence}}\n\nSome modified letters, such as the symbols {{angle bracket|[[\u00e5]]}}, {{angle bracket|[[\u00e4]]}}, and {{angle bracket|[[\u00f6]]}}, may be regarded as new individual letters in themselves, and assigned a specific place in the alphabet for [[collation]] purposes, separate from that of the letter on which they are based, as is done in [[Swedish alphabet|Swedish]]. In other cases, such as with {{angle bracket|[[\u00e4]]}}, {{angle bracket|[[\u00f6]]}}, {{angle bracket|[[\u00fc]]}} in German, this is not done; letter-diacritic combinations being identified with their base letter. The same applies to digraphs and trigraphs. Different diacritics may be treated differently in collation within a single language. For example, in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], the character {{angle bracket|[[\u00f1]]}} is considered a letter, and sorted between {{angle bracket|[[n]]}} and {{angle bracket|[[o]]}} in dictionaries, but the accented vowels {{angle bracket|[[\u00e1]]}}, {{angle bracket|[[\u00e9]]}}, {{angle bracket|[[\u00ed]]}}, {{angle bracket|[[\u00f3]]}}, {{angle bracket|[[\u00fa]]}} are not separated from the unaccented vowels {{angle bracket|[[a]]}}, {{angle bracket|[[e]]}}, {{angle bracket|[[i]]}}, {{angle bracket|[[o]]}}, {{angle bracket|[[u]]}}.\n\n=== Capitalization ===\n{{main|Letter case}}\nThe languages that use the Latin script today generally use [[capital letters]] to begin paragraphs and sentences and [[Noun#Proper nouns and common nouns|proper nouns]]. The rules for [[capitalization]] have changed over time, and different languages have varied in their rules for capitalization. [[Old English language|Old English]], for example, was rarely written with even proper nouns capitalized; whereas [[Modern English]] of the 18th century had frequently all nouns capitalized, in the same way that Modern [[German language|German]] is written today, e.g. {{lang|de|Alle Schwestern der alten Stadt hatten die V\u00f6gel gesehen}} (\"All of the sisters of the old city had seen the birds\").\n\n== Romanization ==\n{{Main|Romanization}}\n\nWords from languages natively written with other [[Writing system|scripts]], such as [[Romanization of Arabic|Arabic]] or [[Romanization of Chinese|Chinese]], are usually [[transliteration|transliterated]] or [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]] when embedded in Latin-script text or in [[Multilingualism|multilingual]] international communication, a process termed Romanization.\n\nWhilst the Romanization of such languages is used mostly at unofficial levels, it has been especially prominent in computer messaging where only the limited 7-bit [[ASCII]] code is available on older systems. However, with the introduction of [[Unicode]], Romanization is now becoming less necessary. Note that keyboards used to enter such text may still restrict users to Romanized text, as only ASCII or Latin-alphabet characters may be available.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Romic alphabet]]\n* [[List of languages by writing system#Latin script]]\n* [[Western Latin character sets (computing)]]\n* [[Latin letters used in mathematics]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last = Haarmann |first = Harald |title = Geschichte der Schrift |trans-title = History of Writing |language = de |publisher = C.

His notable films include ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961), ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), ''[[Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975), ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979), ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'' (1981), ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Congressman]]'' (2016). For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan. [[Bo Derek]] writes in her autobiography that \"there was an ongoing contest between [[John Derek|John]] [Derek] and George Hamilton as to who was tanner\".<ref>Derek, Bo (with Mark Seal) (2002), ''Riding Lessons: Everything That Matters in Life I Learned from Horses'', ReganBooks HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0060394374}}, p.212</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHamilton was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the middle of three boys with an older maternal half brother and a younger full brother, and lived in [[Blytheville, Arkansas]]. He is the eldest son of bandleader [[George Hamilton (musician)|George \"Spike\" Hamilton]].<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/43/George-Hamilton.html George Hamilton Biography (1939\u2013)<!-- Bot generated title -->] from filmreference.com</ref>\n\nHis stepfathers were Carleton Hunt and Jesse Spalding; his stepmother was June Howard, with whom Hamilton said he had an affair when he was 12 years old which was shortly after she married his father.<ref>Beifuss, John.

November 4, 2008</ref>\n\nHamilton attended the [[Hackley School]] in [[Tarrytown, New York]], graduating in 1957.<ref name=\"PAGESIX\">Burroni, Christine, [https://pagesix.com/20George Hamilton reminisces about his high school days\"], ''pagesix.com'', October 21, 2017</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Early appearances===\nHamilton's first roles were in TV. He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1966 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

New York Times ] October 29, 1966: 1.</ref>)\n\nHamilton then made a science fiction movie for [[George Pal]] at MGM, ''[[The Power (1968 film)|The Power]]'' (1968).\n\n===Television===\nGeorge went into television in 1969, supporting [[Lana Turner]] in the all-star ABC series ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]'' (1969\u201370).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/the-survivors/cast/204719/|title=The Survivors (1969) Cast| website=TVGuide.com|publisher=[[TV Guide]]|access-date=September 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhen the show was canceled in January 1970, George went into ''[[Paris 7000]]'' (1970). He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette (film)|Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (1978 film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, the Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (TV movie)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the mini series ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (film)|Amore]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''Bonnie'', ''Diagnosis Murder'', ''Hart to Hart'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor. Subsequently, Hamilton has hosted the live stage adaptation of the show, ''[[The Price Is Right Live!]]''. In August 2008, Hamilton co-starred in ''Coma'', a web series on [[Crackle (company)|Crackle]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Michael Madsen, George Hamilton and Paul Ben-Victor Star in Coma, an Original Web Series Premiering On Crackle.com|url=http://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=73148|publisher=webwire.com|date=August 22, 2008|accessdate=March 5, 2009}}</ref> Hamilton was executive producer of the 2009 film ''[[My One and Only (film)|My One and Only]]'', which is loosely based on his early life and relationship with his mother.\n\nHamilton was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame on August 12, 2009&nbsp;\u2013 his 70th birthday.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.daylife.com/photo/0bMv0nZ2Ce94v |title=Content Marketing Platform - B2B and B2C Content Marketing Technology - NewsCred |publisher=Daylife.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304070010/http://www.daylife.com/photo/0bMv0nZ2Ce94v |archivedate=March 4, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 1999, a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs, California]], [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars|Walk of Stars]] was dedicated to him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180508121758/http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars+dedicated+by+date.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=May 8, 2018|website=web.archive.org}}</ref> Hamilton appeared as a contestant on the UK edition of ''[[I'm a Celebrity\u2026Get Me out of Here!

For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan.

He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1966 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967).

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette (film)|Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (1978 film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, the Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (TV movie)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the mini series ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (film)|Amore]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''Bonnie'', ''Diagnosis Murder'', ''Hart to Hart'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.

As with the Burns series that came before it, each model has several versions with different factory specifications to suit specific budgets and skill levels. The first generation (MP3/MP4), now referred to as the \"classic Inferno\", was produced from late 1991 to the end of 1996 and won every [[International Federation of Model Auto Racing|IFMAR world championship]] during its production run. With 8 [[International Federation of Model Auto Racing|IFMAR]] titles under its belt, the Kyosho Inferno has been the most successful RC car in its scale and deserves the \"fire\" themed brand name which has been in use since the release of the [[Kyosho Burns]] in 1988. <ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== General history ==\n\n=== Background ===\nThe first generation of Infernos were produced from late 1991 to 1996 and shared only a few parts with its predecessor the [[Kyosho Burns|Kyosho Turbo Burns]]. The Inferno was almost a complete redesign based on experiences in competition to increase performance, durability and ease of maintenance.  Any similarity with the Burns series of cars was lost with the introduction of the Inferno MP5 in 1995 which introduced design <u>characteristics</u> which can still be found in the current MP10 more than 20 years later.   \n\nWith the introduction of the Inferno, [[Kyosho]] also chose to sell partially assembled, entry-level kits and introduced their own line of budget GS engines.\n\nAs with the Burns predecessor, it was possible to start with the most affordable car and upgrade to a full option, competition-ready vehicle when the skill and budget allowed. Alternatively one could also buy a competition car for far less than the cost of the individual optional parts.\n\nIt is often not known that the MP (Model Project) nomenclature, which is synonymous with Kyosho buggies from the MP5 onward, was already in use at [[Kyosho]] for the [[Kyosho Burns|Burns series]] and first Inferno series of cars. Burns MP1, Turbo Burns MP2, Inferno MP3, Turbo Inferno MP4.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe versatility of this platform also enabled Kyosho to create 1:8 scale road and rally cars called the \"Super Eight GP LANDMAX 4WD\"<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.classic.rc-junkies.net/?p=549|title=Kyosho Landmax history|website=www.classic.rc-junkies.net}}</ref> and the Inferno ST (Stadium Truck) series. The Landmax were based on the original Inferno chassis until 2001, and then the Inferno MP7.5 chassis until 2008. The ST series is still going strong today although the components used bare little resemblance to the current Inferno buggy. The classic Inferno also had a smaller sibling in 1:10 scale call the Kyosho Inferno 10<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rcscrapyard.net/kyosho-inferno-10.htm|title=Kyosho Inferno 10 on RCScrapyard|website=www.rcscrapyard.net}}</ref> which in turn lead to other \"mini\" versions of the Inferno in later years. \n\n <div class=\"left\">\n\n=== Timeline<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.neobuggy.net/2016/03/01/yuichi-kanais-kyosho-buggy-history-from-inferno-to-mp9-tki4/|title=Kyosho Inferno History|website=Neobuggy}}</ref>===\n<div class=\"left\">{{#tag:timeline|ImageSize=width:800 height:auto barincrement:20\nPlotArea = left:120 bottom:20 top:0 right:20\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod = from:10/01/1991 till:{{#time: m/d/Y }}\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\n#Legend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:3\nScaleMajor = increment:3 start:1992\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1992\n\nColors =\n id:Inferno  value:blue      legend:Inferno\n id:DX  value:blue    legend:DX\n id:Turbo    value:blue    legend:Turbo\n id:DXII value:blue   legend:DXII\n id:MP5 value:gray(0.8)   legend:MP5\n id:MP5EVO1 value:gray(0.8)   legend:MP5EVO1\n id:MP5EVO2 value:gray(0.8)  legend:MP5EVO2\n id:MP6 value:red  legend:MP6\n id:MP6sport value:red  legend:MP6sport\n id:MP6Int value:red  legend:MP6Int\n id:MP75 value:green  legend:MP75\n id:MP75K1 value:green  legend:MP75K1\n id:MP75K2 value:green  legend:MP75K2\n id:MP75sports value:green  legend:MP75sports\n id:MP75K3 value:green  legend:MP75K3\n id:MP777 value:orange  legend:MP777\n id:MP777SP1 value:orange  legend:MP777SP1\n id:MP777SP2 value:orange  legend:MP777SP2\n id:MP777WC value:orange  legend:MP777WC\n id:MP9 value:gray(0.6)  legend:MP9\n id:MP9TKI2 value:gray(0.6)  legend:MP9TKI2\n id:MP9TKI3 value:gray(0.6)  legend:MP9TKI3\n id:MP9TKI4 value:gray(0.6)  legend:MP9TKI4\n id:MP10 value:purple  legend:MP10\n\nBarData =\n bar:Inferno text:\"Inferno 4WD (MP3)\"\n bar:DX text:\"Inferno DX (MP3)\"\n bar:Turbo  text:\"Turbo Inferno (MP4)\"\n bar:DXII text:\"Inferno DX II (MP3)\"\n bar:MP5 text:\"MP5\"\n bar:MP5EVO1 text:\"MP5 EVO 1\"\n bar:MP5EVO2 text:\"MP5 EVO 2\"\n bar:MP6 text:\"MP6\"\n bar:MP6sport text:\"MP6 Sport\"\n bar:MP6Int text:\"MP6 International\"\n bar:MP75 text:\"MP 7.5\"\n bar:MP75K1 text:\"MP 7.5 Kanai 1\"\n bar:MP75K2 text:\"MP 7.5 Kanai 2\"\n bar:MP75sports text:\"MP 7.5 Sports v1-v4\"\n bar:MP75K3 text:\"MP 7.5 Kanai 3\"\n bar:MP777 text:\"MP 777\"\n bar:MP777SP1 text:\"MP 777 SP1\"\n bar:MP777SP2 text:\"MP 777 SP2\"\n bar:MP777WC text:\"MP 777 SP2 WC\"\n bar:MP9 text:\"MP 9\"\n bar:MP9TKI2 text:\"MP 9 TKI2\"\n bar:MP9TKI3 text:\"MP 9 TKI3\"\n bar:MP9TKI4 text:\"MP 9 TKI4\"\n bar:MP10 text:\"MP 10\"\n\nPlotData=\n width:11\n bar:Inferno from:10/01/1991 till:10/01/1993      color:Inferno\n bar:DX from:01/01/1992 till:04/12/1994 color:DX\n bar:Turbo  from:04/02/1994 till:04/12/1995       color:Turbo\n bar:DXII from:01/01/1995 till:12/12/1996 color:DXII\n bar:MP5 from:01/01/1995 till:01/12/1998 color:MP5\n bar:MP5EVO1 from:01/01/1996 till:01/12/1997 color:MP5EVO1\n bar:MP5EVO2 from:01/01/1997 till:01/12/1998 color:MP5EVO2\n bar:MP6 from:01/01/1998 till:12/12/2001 color:MP6\n bar:MP6sport from:12/01/1999 till:12/12/2002 color:MP6sport\n bar:MP6Int from:12/01/1998 till:12/12/2001 color:MP6Int\n bar:MP75 from:12/01/2000 till:12/12/2004 color:MP75\n bar:MP75k1 from:12/10/2000 till:12/12/2001 color:MP75k1\n bar:MP75k2 from:12/12/2001 till:12/12/2002 color:MP75k2\n bar:MP75sports from:12/12/2001 till:12/12/2009 color:MP75sports\n bar:MP75k3 from:12/12/2002 till:12/12/2004 color:MP75k3\n bar:MP777 from:12/10/2004 till:12/12/2008 color:MP777\n bar:MP777SP1 from:12/10/2004 till:12/12/2005 color:MP777SP1\n bar:MP777SP2 from:12/12/2005 till:12/12/2006 color:MP777SP2\n bar:MP777WC from:12/12/2006 till:12/12/2008 color:MP777WC\n bar:MP9 from:12/10/2008 till:12/12/2010 color:MP9\n bar:MP9TKI2 from:12/10/2010 till:12/12/2012 color:MP9TKI2\n bar:MP9TKI3 from:12/10/2012 till:01/12/2016 color:MP9TKI3\n bar:MP9TKI4 from:01/01/2016 till:12/30/2018 color:MP9TKI4\n bar:MP10 from:01/01/2019 till:end color:MP10}}</div></div>\n\n== Classic Inferno (late 1991\u20131996) ==\n\n=== Models and specifications ===\nAs with its predecessor, Kyosho released an intermediate-level car first which contained several performance parts.  Not long after, this would be followed by a more affordable \"DX\" version and then a high performance \"Turbo\" version.  The cars were typically released in kit form; however, Kyosho chose to release \"DX\" entry-level models partially assembled, making the car more attractive for customers who were completely new to the hobby.  Depending on the country of release, the DX models would also include Kyosho's own GS engine, which was already set up and ready to run. This further reduced the complexity and made an otherwise highly technical hobby more approachable for a larger audience.  \n\nThe success of this approach can be seen in the extent to which budget DX cars, that are available second hand, have been upgraded by their owners over time as they gained skill and confidence in the hobby. The Inferno's popularity also spawned a large number of 3rd party suppliers<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rc10talk.com/viewtopic.php?f=30&t=42144&start=105|title=3rd party optional parts for the classic Kyosho Inferno|website=www.rc10talk.com}}</ref> that provided additional performance accessories such as brake discs, carbon fiber plates etc. Original Kyosho parts for these cars were still mostly given the \"BS\" and \"BSW\" nomenclature from the Burns series of cars and were also partially compatible with them. Later models received part numbers starting with IF and IFW.   \n\nThe versatility of this platform also enabled Kyosho to create 1:8 scale road and rally cars called the \"Super Eight GP LANDMAX 4WD\"<ref name=\":10\" /> and the Inferno ST (Stadium Truck) series. The Landmax were based on the original Inferno chassis until 2001 and the original ST until 2005<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rcscrapyard.net/kyosho-inferno-st.htm|title=Kyosho Inferno ST on RC Scrapyard|website=www.rcscrapyard.net}}</ref>, nearly a decade after the production of the classic Inferno buggy ended.    \n\nAfter winning every world championship during its production run, the classic Inferno was phased out in favor of the MP5 in 1995. \n\n==== Inferno 4WD, item no. 3281 (late 1991 \u2013 late 1993) ====\nAs the successor to the Turbo Burns, the classic Inferno not only had a couple of the same parts, but also had a similar body design and countersunk chassis plate. The similarities were largely superficial however with only the following parts being interchangeable with its predecessor. \n* Differentials (however Burns had 2 bevel gears, classic and Turbo Inferno had 4, see comparison table below)<ref name=\":0\" /> \n* Wing and wing mount \n* Shock absorbers \n* Wishbones, hubs and axles\n* Fuel tank \n* Engine mount \n* Most screws, nuts, washers, etc. \nThe car introduced many new design elements and notable improvements which would largely continue in subsequent Inferno models \n* Single radio tray which held all electrical components and could be switched quickly as one unit when desired. (Burns radio tray did not hold the throttle servo)  \n* Stronger shock mounts with more mounting options \n* Differentials with 4 bevel gears (Burns had 2)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/148807212@N06/37470601544/in/photostream/#|title=Kyosho Differential Comparison|website=Flickr}}</ref> \n* Two part diff housings for faster maintenance (Burns diff. housing consisted of 5 parts)\n* New wheels and tires \n** Wide at front and back (Burns had narrow wheels and tires at front with the exception of the limited edition Turbo Burns SCC)\n** Micro spike tires instead of regular spikes\n** Lighter wheels with narrower spokes\n* Separate front and rear disc brake (This was an optional part for the Burns towards the end of its production run and was supplied with the limited edition [[Kyosho Burns|Turbo Burns SCC]]. The Inferno brake setup is not compatible with the Burns series.)\n\n==== Inferno DX; item no. 3290h (1992\u20131994) ====\nJust like the [[Kyosho Burns|Burns series]], the \"DX\" referred to the entry-level specification car. Unlike the Burns, however, this DX came partially assembled and some metal parts such as the exhaust and shock absorbers were replaced with plastic parts. An overview of the differences can be seen in the table below. The BS121 ring and pinion gears were made from a cheaper alloy material instead of the steel gears which were found in the Classic and Turbo versions of the car<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nUnlike the Inferno 4WD und Turbo Inferno, the chassis of the car had additional holes to mount the Kyosho GS21-CR series engine. This particular engine is recognizable by its heat-sink which has vertical instead of the more common horizontal fins<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/c20xB4|title=Kyosho .21 GS21-RC Head|website=Flickr}}</ref>. An interesting cost saving measure was also the lack of countersunk holes in the chassis which would have required an extra production step. This had not been seen since the original Burns.\n\n==== Turbo Inferno; item no. 31346 (1994\u20131995) ====\nContinuing the model naming of the [[Kyosho Burns|Burns series]], the first series of Inferno cars also used the name \"Turbo\" to signify the car with the largest number of performance parts. Visually the Turbo Inferno could easily be identified by the anodized blue chassis plate and larger capacity, blue shock absorbers. Interestingly Kyosho did not include the blue anodized plates which were mounted in the steering and center differential of the Inferno DXII which was released the following year. The Turbo Inferno also included newly designed green wheels, a green spoiler, and unique \"high grip\" tires (part W5646H) which were supplied from the factory. Other than that the car was very similar in specification to the Inferno 4WD as can be seen in the comparison table below. The new, rigid plastic spoiler was the first departure from the Lexan versions which had been used until that point and would remain standard equipment on all future Inferno models.\n\n==== Inferno DX II Ltd.; item no. 31552 (1995\u20131996) ====\nThe DXII used pieces from the initial classic Inferno 4WD, first Inferno DX and Turbo Burns. Most notable differences from the first DX were: \n* The plastic shock absorbers were replaced with those from the classic Inferno 4WD (same type as Turbo Burns)\n* The metal bearings were replaced with the ball bearings from the classic Inferno 4WD and Turbo Inferno\n* The plastic muffler and rubber manifold were replaced with the Aluminum tuned muffler and manifold from the older Turbo Burns\n* The Lexan wing was replaced with the hard plastic wing of the Turbo Inferno, however in the same yellow of the wheels instead of the Turbo's green. Although the part number of the wing stayed the same (BSW-71KY), Kyosho changed the color to neon yellow after the DXII was discontinued making the original yellow wing one of the hardest parts to find for collectors and restorers.\n\nIn addition the DXII had all blue anodized plates (with the exception of the chassis), and an additional hole in the chassis to accommodate a pull start. Some DXII kits also included the GS21-X engine. This engine had a new, larger head with horizontal fins to compensate for the overheating issues of the previous GS21-CR.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/wf62v7|title=Kyosho GS-21 X|website=Flickr}}</ref> The new head was available in plain aluminum (part 6520-31) and later with a blue anodized head (part 6520-31bl)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/L84349|title=Kyosho GS21 X later model heat sink 6520-31|website=Flickr}}</ref> to match the other blue plates on the car.\n\nAs there was no entry-level \"Sports\" version of the subsequent MP5 model the Inferno DXII remained Kyosho's entry-level car until 1996. Kyosho would not release another entry level 1/8 Buggy until the MP6 Sports in 1999. \n\n==== Overview of main differences between classic Inferno models ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\u00a0\n|'''Part name'''\n|'''Turbo Inferno'''\n|'''Inferno 4WD'''\n|'''Inferno DX'''\n|'''Inferno DXII Limited'''\n|-\n|'''1'''\n|Differential ring gear\n|BS14*\n|BS14*\n|BS121\n|BS121\n|-\n|'''2'''\n|Differential pinion gear\n|BS14*\n|BS14*\n|BS121\n|BS121\n|-\n|'''3'''\n|Differential bevel gear (S)\n|BS37 (2 pairs per  diff)\n|BS37 (2 pairs per  diff)\n|BS37 (1 pair per diff)\n|BS37 (1 pair per diff)\n|-\n|'''4'''\n|Differential bevel gear (L)\n|BSW64\n|BS36\n|BS36\n|BS36\n|-\n|'''5'''\n|Tires\n|W5646H\n|BSW40\n|BSW40\n|BSW40\n|-\n|'''6'''\n|Chassis\n|BS108 (blue anodized)\n|BS108\n|BS120\n|GT28\n|-\n|'''7'''\n|Ball bearings\n|Full\n|Full\n|Metal Bushings\n|Full\n|-\n|'''8'''\n|Wheels\n|BSW80KG\n|BS105\n|BS105\n|BS105\n|-\n|'''9'''\n|Wing\n|BSW71KG (Plastic)***\n|BSW5 (Lexan)\n|BSW5 (Lexan)\n|BSW71KY (Plastic)***\n|-\n|'''10'''\n|Shocks\n|BSW72 + BSW73\n|BSW27 + BSW28\n|2001 & 2002  plastic\n|BSW27 + BSW28\n|-\n|'''11'''\n|Front Axels\n|BS20 (Universal)**\n|BS20 (Universal)**\n|BS45 (Dog Bones)\n|BS45 (Dog Bones)\n|-\n|'''12'''\n|Center Diff \n|BSW34 (Adjustable)\n|BSW34 (Adjustable)\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|'''13'''\n|Spur gear\n|BS11\n|BS11\n|BS122\n|BS122\n|-\n|'''14'''\n|Stabilizer\n|BS63 + BSW79\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|'''15'''\n|Fuel Tank\n|BS65\n|BS65\n|BS28\n|BS65\n|-\n|'''16'''\n|Exhaust\n| -\n| -\n|BS123\n|BS64\n|-\n|'''17'''\n|Manifold\n| -\n| -\n|BS124\n|BS26\n|-\n|'''18'''\n|Engine\n| -\n| -\n|Kyosho GS21CR (optional)\n|Kyosho GS21X\n|-\n|'''19'''\n|Plate Set\n|BS115 + BS116\n|BS115 + BS116\n|BS115 + BS116\n|BS115 + BS116 (both blue anodized)\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Depending on the market and year of production the Turbo Infernos and Inferno 4WDs may also have been supplied with BSW-1 and BSW-2 hardened gears from the factory instead of the standard BS-14 set.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rc10talk.com/viewtopic.php?f=30&t=42144&start=45&sid=ac245d6201ce746288d802c59dd88a5a|title=BSW-1 and BSW-2 gear discussion on RC10Talk|website=RC10Talk}}</ref>\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> Kyosho changed the part numbering of BS20 universal joint to IFW62 in the later references.\n\n<nowiki>***</nowiki> Kyosho eventually changed the part numbering of the BSW71 wing to  IFW213. The color codes and colors for all wings are the same with the exception of IFW-213KY which is a neon yellow instead of the regular yellow of part BSW-71KY.\n\n=== Notable optional parts ===\nSeveral of the optional parts which were available for the Turbo Burns could also be used on the first Inferno series, and vice versa. \n\nHowever, the most sought after optional parts which were <u>unique</u> to this first edition of Inferno cars were the BSW-54 special radio post and BSW-55 special diff housing which added rigidity, as well as the BSW86 special servo saver which offered more responsive and accurate steering. The later MP5 and MP6 had similar parts which however were <u>not</u> compatible with the classic Inferno. \n\nThe BSW-55 special diff housing and BSW-82 One Way Diff are among the most rare and expensive parts on the second-hand market<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/3Y9921|title=BSW-55, BSW-82 and BSW-19 on Flickr|website=Flickr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/148807212@N06/38181097951/in/photostream/|title=BSW-55 & BSW-82 disassembled on Flickr|website=Flickr}}</ref>.\n\nOne of the more common, and frequently discussed optional parts are the hardened BSW-1 and BSW-2 differential gears<ref name=\":4\" />. It is also the only series of infernos that had 3 different specifications of differentials (depending on the country of sale). As can be seen in the table above the budget Inferno DX models used a cheaper alloy gear set (BS-121), while the mid-range Inferno 4WD cars came with the BS-14 from the Burns generation, and the Turbo Inferno was supplied with the BS-14 or the optional BSW-1 and BSW-2 set depending on the country of sale.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Box art and marketing material ===\nThe Inferno series continued the same style of box art and marketing material of its predecessor using mostly studio pictures of assembled and painted models. The only exception was the Turbo Inferno which came in a plane white and green box with a drawn outline of the car on the front<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.retromodelisme.com/voiture/255-1/turbo-inferno-kit-kyosho.html|title=Turbo Inferno Unboxing|website=www.retromodelisme.com}}</ref>. The Inferno and Inferno DX/DXII came with a box which had an integrated handle.\n\n=== Collectibillity and current popularity (1996\u2013) ===\nAs with the [[Kyosho Burns|Burns]], the most collectible of this initial line-up is the Turbo version. This is in part due to its rarity, especially in good condition. Collectors specifically look for cars on which the blue anodized chassis has no damage, as well as unused tires as these are very hard to find as spare parts. The demand and value on the second hand market is however significantly lower than the Turbo Burns which preceded it, with near mint condition cars with box often selling for less than 200 US Dollars. Collectors are also interested in the first DX in its original configuration as these were typically upgraded by their owners over time. Their original [[Kyosho]] engine, plastic shock absorbers and exhaust being discarded for higher performance parts \n\nDue to the low re-sale value and an abundance of spare parts, as well as reproduction parts such as new bodies and decals<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marwanrc.com/main.sc;jsessionid=4EC1D4EC52D4AE3E818C846D4BFFD2A6.p3plqscsfapp003|title=Marwan RC|website=MarwanRC}}</ref>, the Inferno 4WD and Turbo Inferno are a good choice for entry and intermediate level RC buggy enthusiasts.

The few remaining parts which are still compatible with the previous Burns cars (MP1-MP2) include the 19mm hex wheels (which would later be changed to 17mm on the Inferno 7.5 as a new industry standard), and the fuel tank. A few other parts such as the wing design, shock absorbers and brake discs were carried across from the Turbo Inferno.\n\nThe MP5/MP6 also included some new design features which remain with the current Inferno line up. \n* Upward angle (kick-up) at the front of chassis<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=121580&id=5484|title=Kyosho MP5 Unboxing|website=Tamiya Club}}</ref>\n* Splash resistant box for receiver and other electronics (instead of being mounted on the radio tray with the servos)\n\nLike its predecessors, the MP3 and MP4 Infernos, the MP5 & MP6 won every [[International Federation of Model Auto Racing|IFMAR]] title during their production run, first in its standard form and later with the EVO editions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.neobuggy.net/2012/11/27/the-world-champions-cars-2010-1986/|title=RC 1:8 Buggy World Championship Winners 1986-2010|website=Neobuggy.net}}</ref> The MP5 and MP6 are visually nearly identical using the same body and wheels, however the MP6 had a longer chassis and wider rear track. Prior to the MP6 this relatively small change was also available on the MP5 in form of a long wheelbase conversion kit. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=53264&sid=5484|title=Kyosho MP5 Long Wheelbase conversion kit|website=TamiyaClub.com}}</ref> \n\n====  MP5, item no. 31551 (1995\u20131998) ====\nAs with the previous Burns and Inferno models Kyosho released an intermediate level car first. Unlike its predecessors, however, no entry level MP5 was produced. \n\nThe MP5 won the world championship in 1996<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcscrapyard.net/kyosho-Inferno-mp5.htm|title=MP5 on RCScrapyard|website=RC Scrapyard}}</ref>, and was marketed as a competition buggy with many in-house options being made available within its first year of production. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmagvintage.com/reviews/retro/voitures/tt/musee/kyosho/catalogues/minicataloguemp5/minicataloguemp5.htm|title=MP5 Options Catalog|website=RCMagvintage}}</ref> \n\n==== MP5 With Picco P6B, item no. 31663P (1996) ====\nA standard Inferno MP5 model packed from the factory with a Picco P6B engine, also includes a manifold and muffler. This version of the Inferno MP5 is identified by a sticker on the button right corner of the box.\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmagvintage.com/reviews/retro/voitures/tt/musee/kyosho/catalogues/minicataloguemp5/minicataloguemp5.htm|title=MP5 Options Catalog|website=RCMagvintage}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcscrapyard.net/kyosho-Inferno-mp5.htm|title=MP5 on RCScrapyard|website=RC Scrapyard}}</ref>  \n==== MP5 EVO1, item no. 31664 (1996\u20131997) ====\nWith the \"EVO\" branding Kyosho distanced itself from the \"Turbo\" nomenclature used for the marketing of previously upgraded vehicles. It was released in 1996 and included a few parts from the options catalog<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=123736&sid=5484|title=MP5 EVO 1 Unboxing and Additional Instruction Manual|website=Tamiya Club}}</ref>. Unlike the standard MP5 which was supplied with the white wheels and wing that were featured on the box art, the EVO1 was supplied with a set of green wheels and a green wing. The car was sold for one year before being replaced by the EVO2.\n\n==== MP5 EVO2, item no. 31781 (1997\u20131998) ====\nThe EVO2 was based closely on the car which won the 1996 World Championship<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=114210|title=Kyosho MP5 EVO2 Unboxing|website=Tamiya Club}}</ref> Among various options the most noticeable difference to the previous MP5 models was the longer chassis and rear wishbones which were later used for the MP6. The chassis extension was also available as an upgrade package for previous MP5s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marwanrc.com/product.sc?productId=93|title=Example of long wheelbase kit for sale|website=www.marwanrc.om}}</ref> Unlike the previous 2 models, this car was not supplied with wheels or a wing. <ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== MP6, item no. 31891 (1998\u20132002) ====\nThe MP6 was essentially a standard MP5 with the longer chassis and wishbones used for the MP5 EVOII, and stronger, blue anodized shock towers. In addition to the shock towers, all other Aluminum plates on the MP6 models were also anodized in blue. The unique feature of this \"standard\" MP6 is the gold anodized chassis plate which is highly sought after in good condition.\n\nA special edition was later released featuring the large capacity shocks of the MP6 International<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/71p5ti|title=MP6 Standard special large shock edition|website=Flickr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/92W457|title=MP6 Standard, special large shock edition|website=Flickr}}</ref>.\n\n==== MP6 Sport, item no. 31951 (1999\u20132002) ====\nFormerly referred to as the \"DX\" for the Burns and classic Inferno series of cars, the \"Sport\" was the entry-level car for the MP6 range. It had similar specification changes as the Inferno DXII and was also supplied with a Kyosho GS21 engine with a blue head to match the blue theme of the car (part 6520-31bl).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/clubtt/buggys.html|title=MP6 Overview|website=Geocities}}</ref> Kyosho supplied the sport with a 3&nbsp;mm chassis instead of the 2.5&nbsp;mm of the standard MP6<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.offroad-cult.org/Tracktest/Inferno%20MP6%20SPORTS/Kyosho%20MP6%20Sports.htm|title=MP6 Sports review|website=Offroad Cult}}</ref>. This may lead one to believe that this was a stronger version to outlive the driving of a novice driver; however, the 2.5&nbsp;mm was actually made from a harder alloy. As with the \"DX\" cars, it was possible to upgrade this car to a standard or international version but at a significantly greater cost than if one had bought the international kit directly.\n\n==== MP6 International, item no. 31892 (1998\u20132002) ====\nThe term MP6 \"International\" was used instead of the \"EVO\" nomenclature used to describe performance versions of the MP5 series. The word \"International\" would not be used in this context again but would reappear from the MP9 TKI2 to TKI4, with the \"TKI\" standing for \"Team Kyosho International\". Unlike the MP5 EVO which only had a selection of optional parts, the MP6 featured almost every available option.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=48595|title=Kyosho MP6 International Unboxing|website=Tamiya Club}}</ref> As most of these options were already available for the MP5, the MP6 International could be released only one year after sales for the standard MP6 started.\n\n==== Overview of main differences between MP5 & MP6 models ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\u00a0\n|'''Part name'''\n|'''MP5'''\n|'''MP5 EVO1'''\n|'''MP5 EVO2'''\n|'''MP6'''\n|'''MP6 Sport'''\n|'''MP6 International'''\n|-\n|1\n|Ball  bearings\n|Full\n|Full\n|Full\n|Full\n|Full\n|Full\n|-\n|2\n|Brakes\n|IF-28\n|IF-28\n|IF-28\n|IFW-53\n|IF-28\n|IFW-53 but with double disc\n|-\n|3\n|Center  Shaft front\n|IF-33 (dogbone)\n|IF-33 (dogbone)\n|IFW-12 (universal)\n|IF-33 (dogbone)\n|IF-33 (dogbone)\n|IFW-12 (universal)\n|-\n|4\n|Center  Shaft rear\n| IF-33 (dogbone)\n| IF-33 (dogbone)\n| IFW-45 (universal)\n| IF-33 (dogbone)\n| IF-33 (dogbone)\n|IFW-45 (universal)\n|-\n|5\n|Chassis\n|IF-4 (2,5mm)\n|IF-4 (2,5mm)\n|IFW-41 (3mm counter sunk)\n|IF-44 (2,5mm, Gold)\n|(3mm not counter sunk)\n|IFW-41 (3mm counter sunk)\n|-\n|6\n|Differential  pinion gear\n|IF-21\n|IF-21\n|IF-21\n|IF-21\n|IF-61\n|IF-21\n|-\n|7\n|Differential  ring gear\n|IF-20\n|IF-20\n|IF-20\n|IF-20\n|IF-61\n|IF-20\n|-\n|8\n|Engine\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|Kyosho GS21R\n| -\n|-\n|9\n|Manifold & Exhaust\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|BS-124 & GT-47\n| -\n|-\n|10\n|Front  Axels\n|BS-20 (universal)*\n|BS-20 (universal)*\n|BS-20 (universal)*\n|BS-20 (universal)*\n|dogbone\n|BS-20 (universal)*\n|-\n|11\n|Front  Shock Stay\n|IF-3\n|IF-3\n|IFW-20\n|IF-47\n|IF-47\n|IFW-20\n|-\n|12\n|Front  torque rod\n| -\n| -\n|IFW-06\n| -\n|IFW-43\n|IFW-43\n|-\n|13\n|Main  Gear 46T\n|IF-22 (plastic)\n|IF-22 (plastic)\n|IFW-03 (steel)\n|IF-22 (plastic)\n|IF-22 (plastic)\n|IFW-03 (steel)\n|-\n|14\n|Manifold\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|BS124\n| -\n|-\n|15\n|Rear  Axels\n|BS-45 (dogbone)\n|BS-45 (dogbone)\n|IFW-42 (universal)\n|BS-45 (dogbone)\n|BS-45 (dogbone)\n|IFW-42 (universal)\n|-\n|16\n|Servo  Saver\n|IF-18\n|IF-18\n|IFW-04 (ball bearing)\n|IF-18\n|IF-18\n|IFW-04 (ball bearing)\n|-\n|17\n|Shocks\n| BSW72 + BSW73\n| BSW72 + BSW73\n|IFW30 + IFW31\n| BSW72 + BSW73\n|BSW72 + BSW73\n|IFW30 + IFW31\n|-\n|18\n|Springs\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|IFW-33W\n|-\n|19\n|Stabilizer  Front\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|IFW-05\n|-\n|20\n|Stabilizer  Rear\n|IF-32\n|IF-32\n|IF-32\n|IF-32\n|IF-32\n|IFW-21 (thicker)\n|-\n|21\n|Steering  Plate\n|IF-19\n|IF-19\n|IFW-14 (blue)\n|IF-19\n|IFW-14 (blue)\n|IFW-14 (blue)\n|-\n|22\n|Steering  Rod Set\n| IF-19\n| IF-19\n| IFW-02 (adjustable)\n| IF-19\n|IF-19\n| IFW-02 (adjustable)\n|-\n|23\n|Wheel  stopper\n| \n| \n| \n| \n|IFW-44 (wide)\n| \n|-\n|24\n|Wheels\n|BSW80W\n|BSW80KG\n|None\n|BSW80W\n|BSW80BL\n|None\n|-\n|25\n|Wing\n| BSW71W\n| BSW71KG\n| None\n| BSW71W\n|BSW71BL\n| None\n|-\n|26\n|Wing  Collar Stay\n|IF-25\n|IF-25\n|IFW-07 (blue)\n|IF-25\n|IF-25\n|IFW-07 (blue)\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Kyosho changed the part numbering of BS20 universal swing to IFW62 in the later references.\n\n=== Notable optional parts ===\nMost of the in-house optional parts were available on the MP6 international and were relatively common compared to the Burns and Classic Inferno options due to the volume of cars that Kyosho was producing and selling by this point. As with the Classic Inferno, the rarest part is the special aluminum center diff, which in this case had part number IFW-8.  It was essentially very similar to the plastic parts they replaced and much less complex that the BSW-55 aluminum differential of the classic Inferno. As it was not provided with the MP6 International, unlike almost all other optional parts, one could assume that Kyosho did not consider it a cost-effective or desirable item.\n\n=== Box art and marketing material ===\nUnlike previous models, the cars on the front of the box of the MP5 and MP6 series were shown with bodies that were unpainted, clearly showing the internals of the car. Only a part of the front of the car had a semi transparent indication of the official paint scheme which could be found on the cars depicted on other parts of the box and in the marketing material.\n\nAlso, unlike the previous inferno models, the box art was largely the same regardless of the version of the car. The main box art showed the initial version of the car (standard MP5 or MP6), with different iterations being indicated by a label at the bottom right corner of the box. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=123736|title=Kyosho MP5 Evo Box|website=www.tamiyaclub.com}}</ref>  \n\nAn exception to this was the MP6 sport which had a clearly distinguishable box-art, and a car with a painted body.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=132478&id=5484|title=Kyosho MP6 Box|website=www.tamiyaclub.com}}</ref> \n\nTo an extent, Kyosho used different colored wheels and wings to highlight the versions of the car on the main box-art however the color coding of these parts was sometimes not the same between the pictures seen in on the box and catalogs, and those which were available in the box. \n\n {| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Car\n!Main Box-Art\n!Main Catalog\n!Sold in Box\n|-\n|MP5\n|White\n|White\n|White\n|-\n|MP5 Evo1\n|White\n|White\n|Green\n|-\n|MP5 Evo2\n|White\n|White\n|None\n|-\n|MP6\n|Orange\n|White\n|None\n|-\n|MP6 Sport\n|Blue\n|Blue\n|Blue\n|-\n|MP6 Int.\n|Orange\n|Green (studio photo) & Orange (track photo)\n|None\n|}\n\n=== Collectibillity and current popularity (2002\u2013) ===\nAt the time of writing in 2018, the MP5 & MP6 are slowly attaining \"classic\" car status<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.classic.rc-junkies.net/?page_id=204|title=What makes a classic?|website=Classic RC Junkies}}</ref> and are not yet particularly sought after on the second hand market. Because of this, good condition MP5 Evo2's or MP6 Internationals are still affordable and parts cars are readily available. This can enable starting hobbyist to have what was once world championship winning technology for a relatively low price. Optional parts are also more readily available and cheaper than those for its Burns and Inferno predecessors.\n\nThe MP6 Sports did not have a good reputation due to its relatively high price and low performance<ref name=\":3\" /> and is typically only sought after by enthusiasts looking to complete a collection. As with the Inferno DX prices for these in good, original condition are relatively high as owners typically discarded the original, low cost parts.   \n\n== Inferno MP7.5  (2000\u20132004, 2009 for \"Sports\" models) ==\n\n===  Models and specifications ===\nAfter nearly 5 years of evolution rather than revolution with the MP5 and MP6 series of cars, Kyosho released the MP 7.5 which was redesigned from the ground up. The \".5\" allegedly stands for the 5 consecutive IFMAR World Championships which had been won by the Inferno series at the time of its release.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vintage-rc.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=141&t=20914&start=30|title=Kyosho Timeline Discussion|website=Vintage-RC}}</ref> \n\n==== MP7.5, item no. 31081 (2000\u20132004) ====\nAs with the other Infernos before it, this first release would provide a good intermediate level car, which could be upgraded to competition specifications relatively quickly. As with the later Kanai competition versions, the selection of the radio gear, motor and muffler were left to the buyer and were not included in the kit.  \n\n==== MP7.5 Sports v1, item no. 31192 (2001\u20132005), v2 item no. 31276 (2005\u20132009), v3 item no. 31278 (2009), v4 item no. 31279 (2009) ====\nFollowing the tradition of previous generations of the Inferno series, the entry level \"Sports\" variant was released a year after the initial mid-range car. It was largely pre-built (often branded as a \"Ready Set\")<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.infernosonly.com/Kyosho_Inferno_Sports_4_Ready_Set_p/kyo31279t2-b.htm|title=Inforno Sports v4 for sale at Infernosonly.com|website=www.infernosonly.com}}</ref>, and was supplied with Kyosho's own GX-21 engine, a pre-painted body and the necessary remote control hardware. It was setup to be easy to drive, with a wide power band and with a price tag of under 400 US Dollars it was aimed at casual and novice drivers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmart.com/kyosho-31275-inferno-mp75-sports-bluewhite-p-13165.html|title=RC Mart MP7.5 Sports|website=RC Mart}}</ref> In line with previous DX and Sports version there are a significant number of differences in the type and quality of parts between this entry level car, and the intermediate and competition variants. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?130955-Differences-between-Inferno-MP7-5-and-Sports-version|title=RC Groups, differences between MP7.5 Standard and MP7.5 Sports.|website=RCGroups.com}}</ref> During its production cycle there were 4 different releases of the MP7.5 Sports which had slightly different specifications and different color body shells, wheels and wings.\n\nAs there was no entry level model for the MP777 which succeeded the MP7.5 in 2005, Kyosho continued manufacturing the Sports versions of the MP 7.5 until 2009 at which point the MP777 was also discontinued.\n\n==== MP7.5 Kanai 1, item no. 31191 (2000\u20132001) ====\nThis was the first ever car in the Kyosho line up to bare the name of its designer and factory race driver Yuichi Kanai. Yuichi Kanai developed all of the Kyosho 1/8 off-road buggies from the Kyosho Turbo Burns onward <ref name=\":1\" /> and was actively competing with the MP7.5 at the time. His name was used for the editions of the car that were released with a selection of the modifications he developed during the race seasons. Quad center disc brakes, special chassis and arms and a special rear wing were a few of the modifications. The Kanai editions were aimed to be competition ready cars for experienced, competitive drivers.\n\n==== MP7.5 Kanai 2, item no. 31271 (2001\u20132002) ====\nThe Kanai 2 was an evolution of the Kanai 1 and focused on improved strength and steering geometry, and had double disk brakes<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcuniverse.com/forum/rc-1-8th-scale-buggies/2370135-whats-kyosho-difference-print.html|title=MP7.5 Differences|website=www.RCUniverse.com}}</ref>. \n\n==== MP7.5 Kanai 3, item no. 31273 (2002\u20132004) ====\nThis was the final version of the MP7.5 which incorporated the lessons learned from the preceding IFMAR championships and other races in which the MP7.5 competed. This car relied less on completely re-designed parts but instead on slight modifications to existing parts to improve the setup and reliability of the car. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmart.com/kyosho-31273-inferno-mp75-yuichi-kanai-p-6078.html|title=RC Mart MP7.5 Kanai 3|website=RC Mart}}</ref> As with other performance variants, this model did not include items such as radio equipment, engine and mufflers as the ideal selection of these were highly dependent on both the track and the driver. In its original condition, the Kanai 3 can be recognized through its milled out chassis and titanium screws. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rctech.net/forum/nitro-off-road/813208-kyosho-mp7-5-kanai.html|title=RCTech MP7.5 Kanai|website=RC Tech}}</ref>\n\n=== Collectibillity and current popularity (2008\u2013) ===\nThe MP7.5 has many years to go before it becomes a classic. Due to the volumes that Kyosho produced it and the fact that there were no special, limited editions of the car, they are also of limited interest to collectors. They do however provide an excellent platform for brushless electric conversion with Kyosho<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/ifw451.html|title=Kyosho Inferno Brushless Conversion Kit|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> and many 3rd party suppliers providing conversion kits. They are one of the most common and most economical secondhand Kyosho 1/8 scale cars available on the second hand market. This makes the 7.5 an excellent car for beginners who are looking for relatively modern technology with an abundance of replacement and performance parts with the option to convert to brushless if desired.\n\n== Inferno MP777  (2004\u20132008) ==\n\n=== Models and specifications ===\nThe MP777 was released in 2004 to celebrate 6 successive wins at the IFMAR world championships.<ref name=\":1\" /> The fact that this car was more of an evolution than a revolution compared to its predecessor is reflected through the retention of the number 7 as the first character of the model number. The main focus of the MP777 was increased durability, better fine tuning options, and improved handling characteristics by moving the center of gravity.  \n\n==== MP777, item no. 31777 (2004\u20132008) ====\nAmong the main changes to the layout and construction of the MP777 there was a newly positioned center of gravity, as well as longer stroke for the rear suspension and more suspension pin angles.  The durability was improved through additional components such as a muffler guard to prevent damage from lateral hits, guarded front hubs, and a newly designed \"dish type\" wheel to prevent dirt from getting in the axels on muddy tracks. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.winrctech.com.hk/product_sub2_sub1.php?id=35&sid=7&bid=1&cc=1|title=MP777 Specs|website=www.winrctech.com.hk}}</ref> Although these changes do not seem significant they provided the foundation to win the IFMAR championship title that followed in Indonesia in 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rccaraction.com/2012-ifmar-18-scale-off-road-world-championships-are-almost-here/|title=List of IFMAR Winners 1986 to 2010|website=www.rccaraction.com}}</ref>\n\n==== MP777 SP 1, item no. 31778 (2004\u20132005) ====\nThe SP1 had a number of upgrades including a \"traction control\" front differential, a machined Duralumin engine mount, various blue anodized alloy parts and also had a set of dampers which had a special coating on the inside to reduce friction. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31779.html|title=MP777 SP1 on Kyosho website|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>  \n\n==== MP777 SP 2, item no. 31779 & 31779S21 (2005\u20132006) ====\nThe SP2 had a couple of differences which were not apparent in the marketing material as this used the same car as the SP1.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31779.html|title=MP777 SP2 on Kyosho website|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kyosho.com/jpn/fun/magazine/pdf/rcw0510_1.pdf|title=Kyosho sales brochure|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> These included a wheelbase which had been lengthened by 4mm while the engine and R/C system had been moved 1.5mm to the rear to improve the stability and steering characteristics. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.winrctech.com.hk/product_sub2_sub1.php?id=36&sid=7&bid=1&cc=1|title=MP777 SP2 Specs|website=www.winrctech.com.hk}}</ref>  \n\nThere was also a special edition with item number 31779S21 which included a Sirio S21BK EVO-2 engine, exhaust and manifold. \n==== MP777 WC, item no. 31780 & 31780S21 (2006\u20132008) ====\nThe MP777 WC Team Edition Kit came with a S21BK EVO-2 STI Motor. The car was a replica of the one which won the 7th IFMAR world championship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31780s21.html|title=Kyosho MP777 WC 31780S21|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>   \n\n=== Collectibillity and current popularity (2008\u2013) ===\nThe MP777 has many years to go before it becomes a classic, and because of the large number that were produced they are not very rare (with the exception of the \"s21\" model numbers with the Sirio engine). Therefore, most are of limited interest to collectors. They do, however, provide an excellent platform for brushless electric conversions with Kyosho,<ref name=\":6\" /> and many third-party suppliers provide conversion kits.\n\n== Inferno MP9  (2008\u20132018) ==\n\n=== Models and specifications ===\nSimilar to Microsoft skipping Windows 9, or Apple the iPhone 9, the omission of an Kyosho MP8 model indicated a revolution between the new MP9 and the previous MP7X models. Despite being redesigned from the ground up, the process apparently only took 6 months.<ref name=\":1\" /> A true indication of this revolution is the fact that the MP9 also embraced the new brushless electric motor technology from the factory in addition to the traditional two stroke engine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/30898.html|title=MP9e TKI4 on Kyosho Website|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> It shares almost no parts with the previous MP7X generation and from the second car onward the abbreviation \"TKI\" which stands for \"Team Kyosho International\" was added to the model name which had not been used before. \n\nThe MP9 has been less successful over its lifetime that the other Inferno models with only one win in 2010 by US driver Cody King <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.femca-rc.com/?attachment_id=2583|title=IFMAR Winners 1986-2018|website=www.femca-rc.com}}</ref>, however there is also now considerably more competition as the cost of engineering and production of the vehicles has decreased over time. Nevertheless, it has won many other competitions and also earned a respectable second place at the IFMAR in 2016. <ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.de/Kyosho-Inferno-TKI4-Buggy-Upgrade/dp/B01F3XLZ70|title=Kyosho TKI3 to TKI4 upgrade kit|website=www.amazon.com}}</ref>  \n\n==== MP9, item no. 31782 & 31783 (2008\u20132010) ====\nAlthough the internals of the car were new from the ground up <ref name=\":1\" />, the body still harked back to the long swooping lines and curves of previous Inferno models. This would start to change from the TKI2 model onward. Different from the MP6 and MP7.5 generations, the budget conscious version of the MP9 no longer used the \"Sports\" branding. Instead it was simply known as number 31783. As with previous entry level cars, the focus lay on keeping the overall characteristics and functionality of the car the same, with the main cost savings being in the materials and level of finish applied to the individual components.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31783.html|title=MP9 71783 Entry Level model|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>  There were no \"ready-set\" pre-assembled cars in this first release.  \n\n==== MP9TKI2, item no. 31784, 31785, 31785CK, 31785JT, 31786 & 31787 (2010\u20132012) ====\nWith the ever increasing speed of the cars, aerodynamics of the body started to play a more important role. This was also noticeable in the marketing material for later models. <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.amainhobbies.com/kyosho-inferno-mp9-tki4-10th-anniversary-special-edition-1-8-nitro-buggy-kit-kyo33011b/p733364|title=MP9 TKI4 10 anniversary edition at Amainhobbies|website=www.ammainhobbies.com}}</ref> The \"cabin\" section of the body became more steeply racked and the back of the body was tapered upwards towards the spoiler. These changes started a shift away from the traditional drawn out, rounded lines that started with the [[Kyosho Burns|Turbo Burns]] back in the late 1980s. The TKI2 started with a semi-assembled 31784 <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/discontinued/dis-rccar/gpoffroad/31784.html|title=MP9 item no.31784 semi assembled on kyosho website|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> and a regular un-assembled 31785 kit. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31785.html|title=MP9 TKI2 31785|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>\n\nAnother first was the launch of limited edition models named after Kyosho team drivers Cody King<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/discontinued/dis-rccar/gpoffroad/31785ck.html|title=MP9 TKI2CR Cody King Special|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> who won the IFMAR championship in 2010, and [[Jared Tebo]] who was the top qualifier.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/discontinued/dis-rccar/gpoffroad/31785jt.html|title=MP9 TKI2JT Jared Tebo special edition|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> They had set numbers 31785CK and 31785JT respectively. The cars were released to celebrate the 8th IFMAR victory and featured the same engine as the championship winning car. Depending on the model, either King's or Tebo's signatures were engraved on the mufflers. As with the MP777 there was also a general World Championship \"WC\" car released which was not driver specific. It had item number 31786 <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/discontinued/dis-rccar/gpoffroad/31786.html|title=MP9 TKI2 31786 Semi Assembled|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>  followed by a semi-assembled \"Spec A\" version of the same car with item number 31787<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31787.html|title=MP9 TKI2 WC Limited Edition Spec-A|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>. This was the final release for the TKI2 range of cars.     \n\n==== MP9TKI3, item no. 31788 & 31888 & 31889T1  (2012\u20132016) ====\nThe TKI3 was a relatively minor evolution of the TKI2 focusing on strengthening certain components and re-positioning of some parts to further optimize the handling. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31788.html|title=MP9 TKI3|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> The big change in the TKI3 line-up was the introduction of a ready-set car which was completely pre-assembled and featured metal parts that were stamped rather than machined to further reduce the cost.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31889t1.html|title=MP9 TKI3 Ready Set|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> There were two model numbers, 31888 and 31889T1 which both had KE21R engines. Based on Kyosho's archive, the 31889T1 was roughly 25% cheaper than a regular, un-assembled version (approx. 60,000 vs. 80,000 Yen), yet included an engine and all necessary electronics.<ref name=\":9\" /> The car appeared to be less of a compromise compared to previous \"Sports\" iterations and offered a more competitive car for entry level enthusiast. Continuing the public's interest in \"ready-set\" cars, the MP9TKI3 was also released as a palm sized Mini-Z version which could be driven indoors and had item number 32081BB. This was the first indication of a true commercialization for the Kyosho Inferno brand.\n\n==== MP9TKI4, item no. 33001, 33007, 30898 & KYO33011B (2016\u20132018) ====\nIn 2016 the TKI4 earned a respectable second place at the IFMAR championships however the changes between the TKI3 and TKI4 were probably among the smallest between Kyosho releases. This can be seen from the parts available in the TKI3 upgrade pack provided by Kyosho.<ref name=\":8\" /> This car was also available as a partially assembled \"Spec-A\" variant with number 33007. The innovation which might have been missing between the TKI3 and TKI4 was definitely compensated for by the MP9e brushless Kit with number 30898. This was the first electric 1:8 off-road buggy that Kyosho had released from the factory and showed the company embracing an entirely different type of technology which not only brings drastic changes to the way a car handles and performs but also requires entirely new parts and a different layout to maintain similar handling characteristics.\n\nIn 2018 an important milestone was reached as the TKI4 welcomed the 10th anniversary of the MP9 series of cars (number KYO33011B). 10 years is the longest production run of any of the 1/8 Kyosho off-road models. This edition also includes many optional parts in the standard kit and is the highest-spec. TKI4.<ref name=\":7\" /> Even more impressive is that in 2018 one also celebrated 30 years since the release of the [[Kyosho Burns|MP1 Burns series]] which essentially set the foundation for all the 1:8 Kyosho Buggys that followed.\n\n== Inferno MP10  (2019\u2013) ==\n\n=== Models and specifications ===\n==== MP10, item no. 33015 (2019\u2013) ====\nIn January 2019 Kyosho released the new MP10  marking an end to the 10-year production cycle of the MP9. The new car was redesigned from the ground up and Kyosho goes to great lengths to show this by illustrating the main changes to the MP9 in detail on the MP10's webpage. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/inferno-mp10/|title=Inferno MP10 on Kyosho main page|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> \n\n== External references and citations ==\n=== External references ===\n* [http://www.rcmagvintage.com/viewforum.php?f=105 Vintage Kyosho Thread at rcmagvintage.com]\n* [http://www.retromodelisme.com/home.html Kyosho Thread on Retromodelisme]\n* [https://www.tamiyaclub.com/forum/index.php?/forum/20-kyosho/ Kyosho Thread on Tamiyaclub.com] \n* [http://www.rcuniverse.com/forum/rc-classic-cars-trucks-513/9089874-vintage-kyosho-buggy-truck-pics-post-them.html Vintage Kyosho Buggy Thread on RCUniverse.com] \n* [http://www.rc-forum.de/forumdisplay.php?693-Kyosho-Offroad Kyosho Thread on RC-Forum.de]\n\n=== Works cited ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n\n[[Category:Model cars]]\n[[Category:Kyosho]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Japanese radio controlled car}}\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Kyosho ''Inferno''}}\n{{Infobox racing car|Car_name=Kyosho Inferno|Image=|Caption=Kyosho Inferno|Category=[[1:8 radio-controlled off-road buggy|1:8 4WD off-road buggy]]|Constructor=[[Kyosho]]|Designer=|Predecessor=Kyosho Burns Series|Successor=|Team=|Drivers=|Technical ref=<!-- <ref name=tech>Insert formatted reference</ref> -->|Chassis=Aluminum|Front suspension=Independent wishbone|Rear suspension=Independent wishbone|Length=<!-- Use: {{convert|XXX|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} -->|Width=<!-- Use: {{convert|XXX|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} -->|Height=|Wheelbase=<!-- Use: {{convert|XXX|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} -->|Track=<!-- Use: {{convert|XXX|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} -->|Gearbox name=|Gears=Shaft driven four-wheel-drive|Type=|Differential=3x 3-gear differentials|Steering=|Weight=<!-- Use: {{convert|XXX|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}} -->|Fuel=Nitro|Lubricants=|Brakes=Double center disc brakes (for front and rear)|Tyres=Rubber pin spike off-road tires with foam inserts|Debut=1991|First_win=|Last_win=|Last_event=|Entries=|Races=|Wins=|Podiums=|Poles=|Fastest_laps=|Titles=|Cons_champ=|Drivers_champ=|Teams_champ=|Engine=Two-stroke .21 \"Nitro\" (3.5cc)|Engine position=Mid mounted}}\nDesigned by Yuichi Kanai<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rccaraction.com/interview-kyoshos-yuichi-kanai-father-of-the-inferno/|title=Kyosho's Yuichi Kanai Father of the Inferno|website=RC Car Action}}</ref> the '''[[Kyosho]] Inferno''' is a  1/8 scale, four-wheel-drive, off-road competition buggy which was first released in late 1991 as the successor to the [[Kyosho Burns|Kyosho Turbo Burns]]<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.kyosho.com/eng/company/rccar_history02.html|title=Kyosho RC Car History|website=Kyosho Company Website}}</ref>.  As with the Burns series that came before it, each model has several versions with different factory specifications to suit specific budgets and skill levels. The first generation (MP3/MP4), now referred to as the \"classic Inferno\", was produced from late 1991 to the end of 1996 and won every [[International Federation of Model Auto Racing|IFMAR world championship]] during its production run. With 8 [[International Federation of Model Auto Racing|IFMAR]] titles under its belt, the Kyosho Inferno has been the most successful RC car in its scale and deserves the \"fire\" themed brand name which has been in use since the release of the [[Kyosho Burns]] in 1988. <ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== General history ==\n\n=== Background ===\nThe first generation of Infernos were produced from late 1991 to 1996 and shared only a few parts with its predecessor the [[Kyosho Burns|Kyosho Turbo Burns]]. The Inferno was almost a complete redesign based on experiences in competition to increase performance, durability and ease of maintenance.  Any similarity with the Burns series of cars was lost with the introduction of the Inferno MP5 in 1995 which introduced design <u>characteristics</u> which can still be found in the current MP10 more than 20 years later.   \n\nWith the introduction of the Inferno, [[Kyosho]] also chose to sell partially assembled, entry-level kits and introduced their own line of budget GS engines.\n\nAs with the Burns predecessor, it was possible to start with the most affordable car and upgrade to a full option, competition-ready vehicle when the skill and budget allowed. Alternatively one could also buy a competition car for far less than the cost of the individual optional parts.\n\nIt is often not known that the MP (Model Project) nomenclature, which is synonymous with Kyosho buggies from the MP5 onward, was already in use at [[Kyosho]] for the [[Kyosho Burns|Burns series]] and first Inferno series of cars. Burns MP1, Turbo Burns MP2, Inferno MP3, Turbo Inferno MP4.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe versatility of this platform also enabled Kyosho to create 1:8 scale road and rally cars called the \"Super Eight GP LANDMAX 4WD\"<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.classic.rc-junkies.net/?p=549|title=Kyosho Landmax history|website=www.classic.rc-junkies.net}}</ref> and the Inferno ST (Stadium Truck) series. The Landmax were based on the original Inferno chassis until 2001, and then the Inferno MP7.5 chassis until 2008.

Not long after, this would be followed by a more affordable \"DX\" version and then a high performance \"Turbo\" version.  The cars were typically released in kit form; however, Kyosho chose to release \"DX\" entry-level models partially assembled, making the car more attractive for customers who were completely new to the hobby.  Depending on the country of release, the DX models would also include Kyosho's own GS engine, which was already set up and ready to run. This further reduced the complexity and made an otherwise highly technical hobby more approachable for a larger audience.  \n\nThe success of this approach can be seen in the extent to which budget DX cars, that are available second hand, have been upgraded by their owners over time as they gained skill and confidence in the hobby. The Inferno's popularity also spawned a large number of 3rd party suppliers<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rc10talk.com/viewtopic.php?f=30&t=42144&start=105|title=3rd party optional parts for the classic Kyosho Inferno|website=www.rc10talk.com}}</ref> that provided additional performance accessories such as brake discs, carbon fiber plates etc. Original Kyosho parts for these cars were still mostly given the \"BS\" and \"BSW\" nomenclature from the Burns series of cars and were also partially compatible with them. Later models received part numbers starting with IF and IFW.   \n\nThe versatility of this platform also enabled Kyosho to create 1:8 scale road and rally cars called the \"Super Eight GP LANDMAX 4WD\"<ref name=\":10\" /> and the Inferno ST (Stadium Truck) series. The Landmax were based on the original Inferno chassis until 2001 and the original ST until 2005<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rcscrapyard.net/kyosho-inferno-st.htm|title=Kyosho Inferno ST on RC Scrapyard|website=www.rcscrapyard.net}}</ref>, nearly a decade after the production of the classic Inferno buggy ended.    \n\nAfter winning every world championship during its production run, the classic Inferno was phased out in favor of the MP5 in 1995. \n\n==== Inferno 4WD, item no. 3281 (late 1991 \u2013 late 1993) ====\nAs the successor to the Turbo Burns, the classic Inferno not only had a couple of the same parts, but also had a similar body design and countersunk chassis plate. The similarities were largely superficial however with only the following parts being interchangeable with its predecessor. \n* Differentials (however Burns had 2 bevel gears, classic and Turbo Inferno had 4, see comparison table below)<ref name=\":0\" /> \n* Wing and wing mount \n* Shock absorbers \n* Wishbones, hubs and axles\n* Fuel tank \n* Engine mount \n* Most screws, nuts, washers, etc. \nThe car introduced many new design elements and notable improvements which would largely continue in subsequent Inferno models \n* Single radio tray which held all electrical components and could be switched quickly as one unit when desired. (Burns radio tray did not hold the throttle servo)  \n* Stronger shock mounts with more mounting options \n* Differentials with 4 bevel gears (Burns had 2)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/148807212@N06/37470601544/in/photostream/#|title=Kyosho Differential Comparison|website=Flickr}}</ref> \n* Two part diff housings for faster maintenance (Burns diff. housing consisted of 5 parts)\n* New wheels and tires \n** Wide at front and back (Burns had narrow wheels and tires at front with the exception of the limited edition Turbo Burns SCC)\n** Micro spike tires instead of regular spikes\n** Lighter wheels with narrower spokes\n* Separate front and rear disc brake (This was an optional part for the Burns towards the end of its production run and was supplied with the limited edition [[Kyosho Burns|Turbo Burns SCC]]. The Inferno brake setup is not compatible with the Burns series.)\n\n==== Inferno DX; item no. 3290h (1992\u20131994) ====\nJust like the [[Kyosho Burns|Burns series]], the \"DX\" referred to the entry-level specification car. Unlike the Burns, however, this DX came partially assembled and some metal parts such as the exhaust and shock absorbers were replaced with plastic parts. An overview of the differences can be seen in the table below. The BS121 ring and pinion gears were made from a cheaper alloy material instead of the steel gears which were found in the Classic and Turbo versions of the car<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nUnlike the Inferno 4WD und Turbo Inferno, the chassis of the car had additional holes to mount the Kyosho GS21-CR series engine. This particular engine is recognizable by its heat-sink which has vertical instead of the more common horizontal fins<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/c20xB4|title=Kyosho .21 GS21-RC Head|website=Flickr}}</ref>. An interesting cost saving measure was also the lack of countersunk holes in the chassis which would have required an extra production step. This had not been seen since the original Burns.\n\n==== Turbo Inferno; item no. 31346 (1994\u20131995) ====\nContinuing the model naming of the [[Kyosho Burns|Burns series]], the first series of Inferno cars also used the name \"Turbo\" to signify the car with the largest number of performance parts. Visually the Turbo Inferno could easily be identified by the anodized blue chassis plate and larger capacity, blue shock absorbers. Interestingly Kyosho did not include the blue anodized plates which were mounted in the steering and center differential of the Inferno DXII which was released the following year. The Turbo Inferno also included newly designed green wheels, a green spoiler, and unique \"high grip\" tires (part W5646H) which were supplied from the factory. Other than that the car was very similar in specification to the Inferno 4WD as can be seen in the comparison table below. The new, rigid plastic spoiler was the first departure from the Lexan versions which had been used until that point and would remain standard equipment on all future Inferno models.\n\n==== Inferno DX II Ltd.; item no. 31552 (1995\u20131996) ====\nThe DXII used pieces from the initial classic Inferno 4WD, first Inferno DX and Turbo Burns. Most notable differences from the first DX were: \n* The plastic shock absorbers were replaced with those from the classic Inferno 4WD (same type as Turbo Burns)\n* The metal bearings were replaced with the ball bearings from the classic Inferno 4WD and Turbo Inferno\n* The plastic muffler and rubber manifold were replaced with the Aluminum tuned muffler and manifold from the older Turbo Burns\n* The Lexan wing was replaced with the hard plastic wing of the Turbo Inferno, however in the same yellow of the wheels instead of the Turbo's green. Although the part number of the wing stayed the same (BSW-71KY), Kyosho changed the color to neon yellow after the DXII was discontinued making the original yellow wing one of the hardest parts to find for collectors and restorers.\n\nIn addition the DXII had all blue anodized plates (with the exception of the chassis), and an additional hole in the chassis to accommodate a pull start. Some DXII kits also included the GS21-X engine. This engine had a new, larger head with horizontal fins to compensate for the overheating issues of the previous GS21-CR.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/wf62v7|title=Kyosho GS-21 X|website=Flickr}}</ref> The new head was available in plain aluminum (part 6520-31) and later with a blue anodized head (part 6520-31bl)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/L84349|title=Kyosho GS21 X later model heat sink 6520-31|website=Flickr}}</ref> to match the other blue plates on the car.\n\nAs there was no entry-level \"Sports\" version of the subsequent MP5 model the Inferno DXII remained Kyosho's entry-level car until 1996. Kyosho would not release another entry level 1/8 Buggy until the MP6 Sports in 1999. \n\n==== Overview of main differences between classic Inferno models ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\u00a0\n|'''Part name'''\n|'''Turbo Inferno'''\n|'''Inferno 4WD'''\n|'''Inferno DX'''\n|'''Inferno DXII Limited'''\n|-\n|'''1'''\n|Differential ring gear\n|BS14*\n|BS14*\n|BS121\n|BS121\n|-\n|'''2'''\n|Differential pinion gear\n|BS14*\n|BS14*\n|BS121\n|BS121\n|-\n|'''3'''\n|Differential bevel gear (S)\n|BS37 (2 pairs per  diff)\n|BS37 (2 pairs per  diff)\n|BS37 (1 pair per diff)\n|BS37 (1 pair per diff)\n|-\n|'''4'''\n|Differential bevel gear (L)\n|BSW64\n|BS36\n|BS36\n|BS36\n|-\n|'''5'''\n|Tires\n|W5646H\n|BSW40\n|BSW40\n|BSW40\n|-\n|'''6'''\n|Chassis\n|BS108 (blue anodized)\n|BS108\n|BS120\n|GT28\n|-\n|'''7'''\n|Ball bearings\n|Full\n|Full\n|Metal Bushings\n|Full\n|-\n|'''8'''\n|Wheels\n|BSW80KG\n|BS105\n|BS105\n|BS105\n|-\n|'''9'''\n|Wing\n|BSW71KG (Plastic)***\n|BSW5 (Lexan)\n|BSW5 (Lexan)\n|BSW71KY (Plastic)***\n|-\n|'''10'''\n|Shocks\n|BSW72 + BSW73\n|BSW27 + BSW28\n|2001 & 2002  plastic\n|BSW27 + BSW28\n|-\n|'''11'''\n|Front Axels\n|BS20 (Universal)**\n|BS20 (Universal)**\n|BS45 (Dog Bones)\n|BS45 (Dog Bones)\n|-\n|'''12'''\n|Center Diff \n|BSW34 (Adjustable)\n|BSW34 (Adjustable)\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|'''13'''\n|Spur gear\n|BS11\n|BS11\n|BS122\n|BS122\n|-\n|'''14'''\n|Stabilizer\n|BS63 + BSW79\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|'''15'''\n|Fuel Tank\n|BS65\n|BS65\n|BS28\n|BS65\n|-\n|'''16'''\n|Exhaust\n| -\n| -\n|BS123\n|BS64\n|-\n|'''17'''\n|Manifold\n| -\n| -\n|BS124\n|BS26\n|-\n|'''18'''\n|Engine\n| -\n| -\n|Kyosho GS21CR (optional)\n|Kyosho GS21X\n|-\n|'''19'''\n|Plate Set\n|BS115 + BS116\n|BS115 + BS116\n|BS115 + BS116\n|BS115 + BS116 (both blue anodized)\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Depending on the market and year of production the Turbo Infernos and Inferno 4WDs may also have been supplied with BSW-1 and BSW-2 hardened gears from the factory instead of the standard BS-14 set.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rc10talk.com/viewtopic.php?f=30&t=42144&start=45&sid=ac245d6201ce746288d802c59dd88a5a|title=BSW-1 and BSW-2 gear discussion on RC10Talk|website=RC10Talk}}</ref>\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> Kyosho changed the part numbering of BS20 universal joint to IFW62 in the later references.\n\n<nowiki>***</nowiki> Kyosho eventually changed the part numbering of the BSW71 wing to  IFW213. The color codes and colors for all wings are the same with the exception of IFW-213KY which is a neon yellow instead of the regular yellow of part BSW-71KY.\n\n=== Notable optional parts ===\nSeveral of the optional parts which were available for the Turbo Burns could also be used on the first Inferno series, and vice versa. \n\nHowever, the most sought after optional parts which were <u>unique</u> to this first edition of Inferno cars were the BSW-54 special radio post and BSW-55 special diff housing which added rigidity, as well as the BSW86 special servo saver which offered more responsive and accurate steering. The later MP5 and MP6 had similar parts which however were <u>not</u> compatible with the classic Inferno. \n\nThe BSW-55 special diff housing and BSW-82 One Way Diff are among the most rare and expensive parts on the second-hand market<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/3Y9921|title=BSW-55, BSW-82 and BSW-19 on Flickr|website=Flickr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/148807212@N06/38181097951/in/photostream/|title=BSW-55 & BSW-82 disassembled on Flickr|website=Flickr}}</ref>.\n\nOne of the more common, and frequently discussed optional parts are the hardened BSW-1 and BSW-2 differential gears<ref name=\":4\" />. It is also the only series of infernos that had 3 different specifications of differentials (depending on the country of sale). As can be seen in the table above the budget Inferno DX models used a cheaper alloy gear set (BS-121), while the mid-range Inferno 4WD cars came with the BS-14 from the Burns generation, and the Turbo Inferno was supplied with the BS-14 or the optional BSW-1 and BSW-2 set depending on the country of sale.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Box art and marketing material ===\nThe Inferno series continued the same style of box art and marketing material of its predecessor using mostly studio pictures of assembled and painted models. The only exception was the Turbo Inferno which came in a plane white and green box with a drawn outline of the car on the front<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.retromodelisme.com/voiture/255-1/turbo-inferno-kit-kyosho.html|title=Turbo Inferno Unboxing|website=www.retromodelisme.com}}</ref>. The Inferno and Inferno DX/DXII came with a box which had an integrated handle.\n\n=== Collectibillity and current popularity (1996\u2013) ===\nAs with the [[Kyosho Burns|Burns]], the most collectible of this initial line-up is the Turbo version. This is in part due to its rarity, especially in good condition. Collectors specifically look for cars on which the blue anodized chassis has no damage, as well as unused tires as these are very hard to find as spare parts. The demand and value on the second hand market is however significantly lower than the Turbo Burns which preceded it, with near mint condition cars with box often selling for less than 200 US Dollars. Collectors are also interested in the first DX in its original configuration as these were typically upgraded by their owners over time. Their original [[Kyosho]] engine, plastic shock absorbers and exhaust being discarded for higher performance parts \n\nDue to the low re-sale value and an abundance of spare parts, as well as reproduction parts such as new bodies and decals<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marwanrc.com/main.sc;jsessionid=4EC1D4EC52D4AE3E818C846D4BFFD2A6.p3plqscsfapp003|title=Marwan RC|website=MarwanRC}}</ref>, the Inferno 4WD and Turbo Inferno are a good choice for entry and intermediate level RC buggy enthusiasts. Scans of the original instruction manuals for the various Inferno models are also available online.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.retromodelisme.com/liste_manuel.html|title=Manual search page on retromodelise.com|last=|first=|date=|website=retromodelisme|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>   \n\nIn lieu of noise restrictions and the advances of battery and brushless technology, some cars are also being converted to an electric powertrain<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.modelbouwforum.nl/threads/kyosho-inferno-dx-brushless.222967/|title=Kyosho Inferno DX Brushless|website=modelbouwforum.nl}}</ref>.\n\n== Inferno MP5 & MP6 (1995\u20132002) ==\n\n===  Models and specifications ===\nThe MP5 was the first of kyosho's 1:8 buggy line up to use the \"MP\" (Model Project), name in public and was largely a clean break from it predecessors as far as the \"BS\" and \"BSW\" parts compatibility is concerned.  The few remaining parts which are still compatible with the previous Burns cars (MP1-MP2) include the 19mm hex wheels (which would later be changed to 17mm on the Inferno 7.5 as a new industry standard), and the fuel tank. A few other parts such as the wing design, shock absorbers and brake discs were carried across from the Turbo Inferno.\n\nThe MP5/MP6 also included some new design features which remain with the current Inferno line up. \n* Upward angle (kick-up) at the front of chassis<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=121580&id=5484|title=Kyosho MP5 Unboxing|website=Tamiya Club}}</ref>\n* Splash resistant box for receiver and other electronics (instead of being mounted on the radio tray with the servos)\n\nLike its predecessors, the MP3 and MP4 Infernos, the MP5 & MP6 won every [[International Federation of Model Auto Racing|IFMAR]] title during their production run, first in its standard form and later with the EVO editions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.neobuggy.net/2012/11/27/the-world-champions-cars-2010-1986/|title=RC 1:8 Buggy World Championship Winners 1986-2010|website=Neobuggy.net}}</ref> The MP5 and MP6 are visually nearly identical using the same body and wheels, however the MP6 had a longer chassis and wider rear track. Prior to the MP6 this relatively small change was also available on the MP5 in form of a long wheelbase conversion kit. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=53264&sid=5484|title=Kyosho MP5 Long Wheelbase conversion kit|website=TamiyaClub.com}}</ref> \n\n====  MP5, item no. 31551 (1995\u20131998) ====\nAs with the previous Burns and Inferno models Kyosho released an intermediate level car first. Unlike its predecessors, however, no entry level MP5 was produced. \n\nThe MP5 won the world championship in 1996<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcscrapyard.net/kyosho-Inferno-mp5.htm|title=MP5 on RCScrapyard|website=RC Scrapyard}}</ref>, and was marketed as a competition buggy with many in-house options being made available within its first year of production. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmagvintage.com/reviews/retro/voitures/tt/musee/kyosho/catalogues/minicataloguemp5/minicataloguemp5.htm|title=MP5 Options Catalog|website=RCMagvintage}}</ref> \n\n==== MP5 With Picco P6B, item no. 31663P (1996) ====\nA standard Inferno MP5 model packed from the factory with a Picco P6B engine, also includes a manifold and muffler. This version of the Inferno MP5 is identified by a sticker on the button right corner of the box.  \n\n\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmagvintage.com/reviews/retro/voitures/tt/musee/kyosho/catalogues/minicataloguemp5/minicataloguemp5.htm|title=MP5 Options Catalog|website=RCMagvintage}}</ref>\n\n==== <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcscrapyard.net/kyosho-Inferno-mp5.htm|title=MP5 on RCScrapyard|website=RC Scrapyard}}</ref>MP5 EVO1, item no. 31664 (1996\u20131997) ====\nWith the \"EVO\" branding Kyosho distanced itself from the \"Turbo\" nomenclature used for the marketing of previously upgraded vehicles. It was released in 1996 and included a few parts from the options catalog<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=123736&sid=5484|title=MP5 EVO 1 Unboxing and Additional Instruction Manual|website=Tamiya Club}}</ref>. Unlike the standard MP5 which was supplied with the white wheels and wing that were featured on the box art, the EVO1 was supplied with a set of green wheels and a green wing. The car was sold for one year before being replaced by the EVO2.\n\n==== MP5 EVO2, item no. 31781 (1997\u20131998) ====\nThe EVO2 was based closely on the car which won the 1996 World Championship<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=114210|title=Kyosho MP5 EVO2 Unboxing|website=Tamiya Club}}</ref> Among various options the most noticeable difference to the previous MP5 models was the longer chassis and rear wishbones which were later used for the MP6. The chassis extension was also available as an upgrade package for previous MP5s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marwanrc.com/product.sc?productId=93|title=Example of long wheelbase kit for sale|website=www.marwanrc.om}}</ref> Unlike the previous 2 models, this car was not supplied with wheels or a wing. <ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== MP6, item no. 31891 (1998\u20132002) ====\nThe MP6 was essentially a standard MP5 with the longer chassis and wishbones used for the MP5 EVOII, and stronger, blue anodized shock towers. In addition to the shock towers, all other Aluminum plates on the MP6 models were also anodized in blue. The unique feature of this \"standard\" MP6 is the gold anodized chassis plate which is highly sought after in good condition.\n\nA special edition was later released featuring the large capacity shocks of the MP6 International<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/71p5ti|title=MP6 Standard special large shock edition|website=Flickr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/92W457|title=MP6 Standard, special large shock edition|website=Flickr}}</ref>.\n\n==== MP6 Sport, item no. 31951 (1999\u20132002) ====\nFormerly referred to as the \"DX\" for the Burns and classic Inferno series of cars, the \"Sport\" was the entry-level car for the MP6 range. It had similar specification changes as the Inferno DXII and was also supplied with a Kyosho GS21 engine with a blue head to match the blue theme of the car (part 6520-31bl).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/clubtt/buggys.html|title=MP6 Overview|website=Geocities}}</ref> Kyosho supplied the sport with a 3&nbsp;mm chassis instead of the 2.5&nbsp;mm of the standard MP6<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.offroad-cult.org/Tracktest/Inferno%20MP6%20SPORTS/Kyosho%20MP6%20Sports.htm|title=MP6 Sports review|website=Offroad Cult}}</ref>. This may lead one to believe that this was a stronger version to outlive the driving of a novice driver; however, the 2.5&nbsp;mm was actually made from a harder alloy. As with the \"DX\" cars, it was possible to upgrade this car to a standard or international version but at a significantly greater cost than if one had bought the international kit directly.\n\n==== MP6 International, item no. 31892 (1998\u20132002) ====\nThe term MP6 \"International\" was used instead of the \"EVO\" nomenclature used to describe performance versions of the MP5 series. The word \"International\" would not be used in this context again but would reappear from the MP9 TKI2 to TKI4, with the \"TKI\" standing for \"Team Kyosho International\". Unlike the MP5 EVO which only had a selection of optional parts, the MP6 featured almost every available option.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=48595|title=Kyosho MP6 International Unboxing|website=Tamiya Club}}</ref> As most of these options were already available for the MP5, the MP6 International could be released only one year after sales for the standard MP6 started.\n\n==== Overview of main differences between MP5 & MP6 models ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\u00a0\n|'''Part name'''\n|'''MP5'''\n|'''MP5 EVO1'''\n|'''MP5 EVO2'''\n|'''MP6'''\n|'''MP6 Sport'''\n|'''MP6 International'''\n|-\n|1\n|Ball  bearings\n|Full\n|Full\n|Full\n|Full\n|Full\n|Full\n|-\n|2\n|Brakes\n|IF-28\n|IF-28\n|IF-28\n|IFW-53\n|IF-28\n|IFW-53 but with double disc\n|-\n|3\n|Center  Shaft front\n|IF-33 (dogbone)\n|IF-33 (dogbone)\n|IFW-12 (universal)\n|IF-33 (dogbone)\n|IF-33 (dogbone)\n|IFW-12 (universal)\n|-\n|4\n|Center  Shaft rear\n| IF-33 (dogbone)\n| IF-33 (dogbone)\n| IFW-45 (universal)\n| IF-33 (dogbone)\n| IF-33 (dogbone)\n|IFW-45 (universal)\n|-\n|5\n|Chassis\n|IF-4 (2,5mm)\n|IF-4 (2,5mm)\n|IFW-41 (3mm counter sunk)\n|IF-44 (2,5mm, Gold)\n|(3mm not counter sunk)\n|IFW-41 (3mm counter sunk)\n|-\n|6\n|Differential  pinion gear\n|IF-21\n|IF-21\n|IF-21\n|IF-21\n|IF-61\n|IF-21\n|-\n|7\n|Differential  ring gear\n|IF-20\n|IF-20\n|IF-20\n|IF-20\n|IF-61\n|IF-20\n|-\n|8\n|Engine\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|Kyosho GS21R\n| -\n|-\n|9\n|Manifold & Exhaust\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|BS-124 & GT-47\n| -\n|-\n|10\n|Front  Axels\n|BS-20 (universal)*\n|BS-20 (universal)*\n|BS-20 (universal)*\n|BS-20 (universal)*\n|dogbone\n|BS-20 (universal)*\n|-\n|11\n|Front  Shock Stay\n|IF-3\n|IF-3\n|IFW-20\n|IF-47\n|IF-47\n|IFW-20\n|-\n|12\n|Front  torque rod\n| -\n| -\n|IFW-06\n| -\n|IFW-43\n|IFW-43\n|-\n|13\n|Main  Gear 46T\n|IF-22 (plastic)\n|IF-22 (plastic)\n|IFW-03 (steel)\n|IF-22 (plastic)\n|IF-22 (plastic)\n|IFW-03 (steel)\n|-\n|14\n|Manifold\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|BS124\n| -\n|-\n|15\n|Rear  Axels\n|BS-45 (dogbone)\n|BS-45 (dogbone)\n|IFW-42 (universal)\n|BS-45 (dogbone)\n|BS-45 (dogbone)\n|IFW-42 (universal)\n|-\n|16\n|Servo  Saver\n|IF-18\n|IF-18\n|IFW-04 (ball bearing)\n|IF-18\n|IF-18\n|IFW-04 (ball bearing)\n|-\n|17\n|Shocks\n| BSW72 + BSW73\n| BSW72 + BSW73\n|IFW30 + IFW31\n| BSW72 + BSW73\n|BSW72 + BSW73\n|IFW30 + IFW31\n|-\n|18\n|Springs\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|IFW-33W\n|-\n|19\n|Stabilizer  Front\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|IFW-05\n|-\n|20\n|Stabilizer  Rear\n|IF-32\n|IF-32\n|IF-32\n|IF-32\n|IF-32\n|IFW-21 (thicker)\n|-\n|21\n|Steering  Plate\n|IF-19\n|IF-19\n|IFW-14 (blue)\n|IF-19\n|IFW-14 (blue)\n|IFW-14 (blue)\n|-\n|22\n|Steering  Rod Set\n| IF-19\n| IF-19\n| IFW-02 (adjustable)\n| IF-19\n|IF-19\n| IFW-02 (adjustable)\n|-\n|23\n|Wheel  stopper\n| \n| \n| \n| \n|IFW-44 (wide)\n| \n|-\n|24\n|Wheels\n|BSW80W\n|BSW80KG\n|None\n|BSW80W\n|BSW80BL\n|None\n|-\n|25\n|Wing\n| BSW71W\n| BSW71KG\n| None\n| BSW71W\n|BSW71BL\n| None\n|-\n|26\n|Wing  Collar Stay\n|IF-25\n|IF-25\n|IFW-07 (blue)\n|IF-25\n|IF-25\n|IFW-07 (blue)\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Kyosho changed the part numbering of BS20 universal swing to IFW62 in the later references.\n\n=== Notable optional parts ===\nMost of the in-house optional parts were available on the MP6 international and were relatively common compared to the Burns and Classic Inferno options due to the volume of cars that Kyosho was producing and selling by this point. As with the Classic Inferno, the rarest part is the special aluminum center diff, which in this case had part number IFW-8.  It was essentially very similar to the plastic parts they replaced and much less complex that the BSW-55 aluminum differential of the classic Inferno. As it was not provided with the MP6 International, unlike almost all other optional parts, one could assume that Kyosho did not consider it a cost-effective or desirable item.\n\n=== Box art and marketing material ===\nUnlike previous models, the cars on the front of the box of the MP5 and MP6 series were shown with bodies that were unpainted, clearly showing the internals of the car. Only a part of the front of the car had a semi transparent indication of the official paint scheme which could be found on the cars depicted on other parts of the box and in the marketing material.\n\nAlso, unlike the previous inferno models, the box art was largely the same regardless of the version of the car. The main box art showed the initial version of the car (standard MP5 or MP6), with different iterations being indicated by a label at the bottom right corner of the box. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=123736|title=Kyosho MP5 Evo Box|website=www.tamiyaclub.com}}</ref>  \n\nAn exception to this was the MP6 sport which had a clearly distinguishable box-art, and a car with a painted body.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=132478&id=5484|title=Kyosho MP6 Box|website=www.tamiyaclub.com}}</ref> \n\nTo an extent, Kyosho used different colored wheels and wings to highlight the versions of the car on the main box-art however the color coding of these parts was sometimes not the same between the pictures seen in on the box and catalogs, and those which were available in the box. \n\n {| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Car\n!Main Box-Art\n!Main Catalog\n!Sold in Box\n|-\n|MP5\n|White\n|White\n|White\n|-\n|MP5 Evo1\n|White\n|White\n|Green\n|-\n|MP5 Evo2\n|White\n|White\n|None\n|-\n|MP6\n|Orange\n|White\n|None\n|-\n|MP6 Sport\n|Blue\n|Blue\n|Blue\n|-\n|MP6 Int.\n|Orange\n|Green (studio photo) & Orange (track photo)\n|None\n|}\n\n=== Collectibillity and current popularity (2002\u2013) ===\nAt the time of writing in 2018, the MP5 & MP6 are slowly attaining \"classic\" car status<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.classic.rc-junkies.net/?page_id=204|title=What makes a classic?|website=Classic RC Junkies}}</ref> and are not yet particularly sought after on the second hand market. Because of this, good condition MP5 Evo2's or MP6 Internationals are still affordable and parts cars are readily available. This can enable starting hobbyist to have what was once world championship winning technology for a relatively low price. Optional parts are also more readily available and cheaper than those for its Burns and Inferno predecessors.\n\nThe MP6 Sports did not have a good reputation due to its relatively high price and low performance<ref name=\":3\" /> and is typically only sought after by enthusiasts looking to complete a collection. As with the Inferno DX prices for these in good, original condition are relatively high as owners typically discarded the original, low cost parts.   \n\n== Inferno MP7.5  (2000\u20132004, 2009 for \"Sports\" models) ==\n\n===  Models and specifications ===\nAfter nearly 5 years of evolution rather than revolution with the MP5 and MP6 series of cars, Kyosho released the MP 7.5 which was redesigned from the ground up. The \".5\" allegedly stands for the 5 consecutive IFMAR World Championships which had been won by the Inferno series at the time of its release.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vintage-rc.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=141&t=20914&start=30|title=Kyosho Timeline Discussion|website=Vintage-RC}}</ref> \n\n==== MP7.5, item no. 31081 (2000\u20132004) ====\nAs with the other Infernos before it, this first release would provide a good intermediate level car, which could be upgraded to competition specifications relatively quickly. As with the later Kanai competition versions, the selection of the radio gear, motor and muffler were left to the buyer and were not included in the kit.  \n\n==== MP7.5 Sports v1, item no. 31192 (2001\u20132005), v2 item no. 31276 (2005\u20132009), v3 item no. 31278 (2009), v4 item no. 31279 (2009) ====\nFollowing the tradition of previous generations of the Inferno series, the entry level \"Sports\" variant was released a year after the initial mid-range car. It was largely pre-built (often branded as a \"Ready Set\")<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.infernosonly.com/Kyosho_Inferno_Sports_4_Ready_Set_p/kyo31279t2-b.htm|title=Inforno Sports v4 for sale at Infernosonly.com|website=www.infernosonly.com}}</ref>, and was supplied with Kyosho's own GX-21 engine, a pre-painted body and the necessary remote control hardware. It was setup to be easy to drive, with a wide power band and with a price tag of under 400 US Dollars it was aimed at casual and novice drivers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmart.com/kyosho-31275-inferno-mp75-sports-bluewhite-p-13165.html|title=RC Mart MP7.5 Sports|website=RC Mart}}</ref> In line with previous DX and Sports version there are a significant number of differences in the type and quality of parts between this entry level car, and the intermediate and competition variants. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?130955-Differences-between-Inferno-MP7-5-and-Sports-version|title=RC Groups, differences between MP7.5 Standard and MP7.5 Sports.|website=RCGroups.com}}</ref> During its production cycle there were 4 different releases of the MP7.5 Sports which had slightly different specifications and different color body shells, wheels and wings.\n\nAs there was no entry level model for the MP777 which succeeded the MP7.5 in 2005, Kyosho continued manufacturing the Sports versions of the MP 7.5 until 2009 at which point the MP777 was also discontinued.\n\n==== MP7.5 Kanai 1, item no. 31191 (2000\u20132001) ====\nThis was the first ever car in the Kyosho line up to bare the name of its designer and factory race driver Yuichi Kanai. Yuichi Kanai developed all of the Kyosho 1/8 off-road buggies from the Kyosho Turbo Burns onward <ref name=\":1\" /> and was actively competing with the MP7.5 at the time. His name was used for the editions of the car that were released with a selection of the modifications he developed during the race seasons. Quad center disc brakes, special chassis and arms and a special rear wing were a few of the modifications. The Kanai editions were aimed to be competition ready cars for experienced, competitive drivers.\n\n==== MP7.5 Kanai 2, item no. 31271 (2001\u20132002) ====\nThe Kanai 2 was an evolution of the Kanai 1 and focused on improved strength and steering geometry, and had double disk brakes<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcuniverse.com/forum/rc-1-8th-scale-buggies/2370135-whats-kyosho-difference-print.html|title=MP7.5 Differences|website=www.RCUniverse.com}}</ref>. \n\n==== MP7.5 Kanai 3, item no. 31273 (2002\u20132004) ====\nThis was the final version of the MP7.5 which incorporated the lessons learned from the preceding IFMAR championships and other races in which the MP7.5 competed. This car relied less on completely re-designed parts but instead on slight modifications to existing parts to improve the setup and reliability of the car. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmart.com/kyosho-31273-inferno-mp75-yuichi-kanai-p-6078.html|title=RC Mart MP7.5 Kanai 3|website=RC Mart}}</ref> As with other performance variants, this model did not include items such as radio equipment, engine and mufflers as the ideal selection of these were highly dependent on both the track and the driver. In its original condition, the Kanai 3 can be recognized through its milled out chassis and titanium screws. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rctech.net/forum/nitro-off-road/813208-kyosho-mp7-5-kanai.html|title=RCTech MP7.5 Kanai|website=RC Tech}}</ref>\n\n=== Collectibillity and current popularity (2008\u2013) ===\nThe MP7.5 has many years to go before it becomes a classic. Due to the volumes that Kyosho produced it and the fact that there were no special, limited editions of the car, they are also of limited interest to collectors. They do however provide an excellent platform for brushless electric conversion with Kyosho<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/ifw451.html|title=Kyosho Inferno Brushless Conversion Kit|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> and many 3rd party suppliers providing conversion kits. They are one of the most common and most economical secondhand Kyosho 1/8 scale cars available on the second hand market. This makes the 7.5 an excellent car for beginners who are looking for relatively modern technology with an abundance of replacement and performance parts with the option to convert to brushless if desired.\n\n== Inferno MP777  (2004\u20132008) ==\n\n=== Models and specifications ===\nThe MP777 was released in 2004 to celebrate 6 successive wins at the IFMAR world championships.<ref name=\":1\" /> The fact that this car was more of an evolution than a revolution compared to its predecessor is reflected through the retention of the number 7 as the first character of the model number. The main focus of the MP777 was increased durability, better fine tuning options, and improved handling characteristics by moving the center of gravity.  \n\n==== MP777, item no. 31777 (2004\u20132008) ====\nAmong the main changes to the layout and construction of the MP777 there was a newly positioned center of gravity, as well as longer stroke for the rear suspension and more suspension pin angles.  The durability was improved through additional components such as a muffler guard to prevent damage from lateral hits, guarded front hubs, and a newly designed \"dish type\" wheel to prevent dirt from getting in the axels on muddy tracks. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.winrctech.com.hk/product_sub2_sub1.php?id=35&sid=7&bid=1&cc=1|title=MP777 Specs|website=www.winrctech.com.hk}}</ref> Although these changes do not seem significant they provided the foundation to win the IFMAR championship title that followed in Indonesia in 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rccaraction.com/2012-ifmar-18-scale-off-road-world-championships-are-almost-here/|title=List of IFMAR Winners 1986 to 2010|website=www.rccaraction.com}}</ref>\n\n==== MP777 SP 1, item no. 31778 (2004\u20132005) ====\nThe SP1 had a number of upgrades including a \"traction control\" front differential, a machined Duralumin engine mount, various blue anodized alloy parts and also had a set of dampers which had a special coating on the inside to reduce friction. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31779.html|title=MP777 SP1 on Kyosho website|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>  \n\n==== MP777 SP 2, item no. 31779 & 31779S21 (2005\u20132006) ====\nThe SP2 had a couple of differences which were not apparent in the marketing material as this used the same car as the SP1.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31779.html|title=MP777 SP2 on Kyosho website|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kyosho.com/jpn/fun/magazine/pdf/rcw0510_1.pdf|title=Kyosho sales brochure|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> These included a wheelbase which had been lengthened by 4mm while the engine and R/C system had been moved 1.5mm to the rear to improve the stability and steering characteristics. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.winrctech.com.hk/product_sub2_sub1.php?id=36&sid=7&bid=1&cc=1|title=MP777 SP2 Specs|website=www.winrctech.com.hk}}</ref>  \n\nThere was also a special edition with item number 31779S21 which included a Sirio S21BK EVO-2 engine, exhaust and manifold. \n==== MP777 WC, item no. 31780 & 31780S21 (2006\u20132008) ====\nThe MP777 WC Team Edition Kit came with a S21BK EVO-2 STI Motor. The car was a replica of the one which won the 7th IFMAR world championship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31780s21.html|title=Kyosho MP777 WC 31780S21|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>   \n\n=== Collectibillity and current popularity (2008\u2013) ===\nThe MP777 has many years to go before it becomes a classic, and because of the large number that were produced they are not very rare (with the exception of the \"s21\" model numbers with the Sirio engine). Therefore, most are of limited interest to collectors. They do, however, provide an excellent platform for brushless electric conversions with Kyosho,<ref name=\":6\" /> and many third-party suppliers provide conversion kits.\n\n== Inferno MP9  (2008\u20132018) ==\n\n=== Models and specifications ===\nSimilar to Microsoft skipping Windows 9, or Apple the iPhone 9, the omission of an Kyosho MP8 model indicated a revolution between the new MP9 and the previous MP7X models. Despite being redesigned from the ground up, the process apparently only took 6 months.<ref name=\":1\" /> A true indication of this revolution is the fact that the MP9 also embraced the new brushless electric motor technology from the factory in addition to the traditional two stroke engine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/30898.html|title=MP9e TKI4 on Kyosho Website|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> It shares almost no parts with the previous MP7X generation and from the second car onward the abbreviation \"TKI\" which stands for \"Team Kyosho International\" was added to the model name which had not been used before. \n\nThe MP9 has been less successful over its lifetime that the other Inferno models with only one win in 2010 by US driver Cody King <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.femca-rc.com/?attachment_id=2583|title=IFMAR Winners 1986-2018|website=www.femca-rc.com}}</ref>, however there is also now considerably more competition as the cost of engineering and production of the vehicles has decreased over time. Nevertheless, it has won many other competitions and also earned a respectable second place at the IFMAR in 2016. <ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.de/Kyosho-Inferno-TKI4-Buggy-Upgrade/dp/B01F3XLZ70|title=Kyosho TKI3 to TKI4 upgrade kit|website=www.amazon.com}}</ref>  \n\n==== MP9, item no. 31782 & 31783 (2008\u20132010) ====\nAlthough the internals of the car were new from the ground up <ref name=\":1\" />, the body still harked back to the long swooping lines and curves of previous Inferno models. This would start to change from the TKI2 model onward. Different from the MP6 and MP7.5 generations, the budget conscious version of the MP9 no longer used the \"Sports\" branding. Instead it was simply known as number 31783. As with previous entry level cars, the focus lay on keeping the overall characteristics and functionality of the car the same, with the main cost savings being in the materials and level of finish applied to the individual components.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31783.html|title=MP9 71783 Entry Level model|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>  There were no \"ready-set\" pre-assembled cars in this first release.  \n\n==== MP9TKI2, item no. 31784, 31785, 31785CK, 31785JT, 31786 & 31787 (2010\u20132012) ====\nWith the ever increasing speed of the cars, aerodynamics of the body started to play a more important role. This was also noticeable in the marketing material for later models. <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.amainhobbies.com/kyosho-inferno-mp9-tki4-10th-anniversary-special-edition-1-8-nitro-buggy-kit-kyo33011b/p733364|title=MP9 TKI4 10 anniversary edition at Amainhobbies|website=www.ammainhobbies.com}}</ref> The \"cabin\" section of the body became more steeply racked and the back of the body was tapered upwards towards the spoiler. These changes started a shift away from the traditional drawn out, rounded lines that started with the [[Kyosho Burns|Turbo Burns]] back in the late 1980s. The TKI2 started with a semi-assembled 31784 <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/discontinued/dis-rccar/gpoffroad/31784.html|title=MP9 item no.31784 semi assembled on kyosho website|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> and a regular un-assembled 31785 kit. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31785.html|title=MP9 TKI2 31785|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>\n\nAnother first was the launch of limited edition models named after Kyosho team drivers Cody King<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/discontinued/dis-rccar/gpoffroad/31785ck.html|title=MP9 TKI2CR Cody King Special|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> who won the IFMAR championship in 2010, and [[Jared Tebo]] who was the top qualifier.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/discontinued/dis-rccar/gpoffroad/31785jt.html|title=MP9 TKI2JT Jared Tebo special edition|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> They had set numbers 31785CK and 31785JT respectively. The cars were released to celebrate the 8th IFMAR victory and featured the same engine as the championship winning car. Depending on the model, either King's or Tebo's signatures were engraved on the mufflers. As with the MP777 there was also a general World Championship \"WC\" car released which was not driver specific. It had item number 31786 <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/discontinued/dis-rccar/gpoffroad/31786.html|title=MP9 TKI2 31786 Semi Assembled|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>  followed by a semi-assembled \"Spec A\" version of the same car with item number 31787<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31787.html|title=MP9 TKI2 WC Limited Edition Spec-A|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>. This was the final release for the TKI2 range of cars.     \n\n==== MP9TKI3, item no. 31788 & 31888 & 31889T1  (2012\u20132016) ====\nThe TKI3 was a relatively minor evolution of the TKI2 focusing on strengthening certain components and re-positioning of some parts to further optimize the handling. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31788.html|title=MP9 TKI3|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> The big change in the TKI3 line-up was the introduction of a ready-set car which was completely pre-assembled and featured metal parts that were stamped rather than machined to further reduce the cost.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31889t1.html|title=MP9 TKI3 Ready Set|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> There were two model numbers, 31888 and 31889T1 which both had KE21R engines. Based on Kyosho's archive, the 31889T1 was roughly 25% cheaper than a regular, un-assembled version (approx. 60,000 vs. 80,000 Yen), yet included an engine and all necessary electronics.<ref name=\":9\" /> The car appeared to be less of a compromise compared to previous \"Sports\" iterations and offered a more competitive car for entry level enthusiast. Continuing the public's interest in \"ready-set\" cars, the MP9TKI3 was also released as a palm sized Mini-Z version which could be driven indoors and had item number 32081BB. This was the first indication of a true commercialization for the Kyosho Inferno brand.\n\n==== MP9TKI4, item no. 33001, 33007, 30898 & KYO33011B (2016\u20132018) ====\nIn 2016 the TKI4 earned a respectable second place at the IFMAR championships however the changes between the TKI3 and TKI4 were probably among the smallest between Kyosho releases. This can be seen from the parts available in the TKI3 upgrade pack provided by Kyosho.<ref name=\":8\" /> This car was also available as a partially assembled \"Spec-A\" variant with number 33007. The innovation which might have been missing between the TKI3 and TKI4 was definitely compensated for by the MP9e brushless Kit with number 30898. This was the first electric 1:8 off-road buggy that Kyosho had released from the factory and showed the company embracing an entirely different type of technology which not only brings drastic changes to the way a car handles and performs but also requires entirely new parts and a different layout to maintain similar handling characteristics.\n\nIn 2018 an important milestone was reached as the TKI4 welcomed the 10th anniversary of the MP9 series of cars (number KYO33011B). 10 years is the longest production run of any of the 1/8 Kyosho off-road models. This edition also includes many optional parts in the standard kit and is the highest-spec. TKI4.<ref name=\":7\" /> Even more impressive is that in 2018 one also celebrated 30 years since the release of the [[Kyosho Burns|MP1 Burns series]] which essentially set the foundation for all the 1:8 Kyosho Buggys that followed.\n\n== Inferno MP10  (2019\u2013) ==\n\n=== Models and specifications ===\n==== MP10, item no. 33015 (2019\u2013) ====\nIn January 2019 Kyosho released the new MP10  marking an end to the 10-year production cycle of the MP9. The new car was redesigned from the ground up and Kyosho goes to great lengths to show this by illustrating the main changes to the MP9 in detail on the MP10's webpage. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/inferno-mp10/|title=Inferno MP10 on Kyosho main page|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> \n\n== External references and citations ==\n=== External references ===\n* [http://www.rcmagvintage.com/viewforum.php?f=105 Vintage Kyosho Thread at rcmagvintage.com]\n* [http://www.retromodelisme.com/home.html Kyosho Thread on Retromodelisme]\n* [https://www.tamiyaclub.com/forum/index.php?/forum/20-kyosho/ Kyosho Thread on Tamiyaclub.com] \n* [http://www.rcuniverse.com/forum/rc-classic-cars-trucks-513/9089874-vintage-kyosho-buggy-truck-pics-post-them.html Vintage Kyosho Buggy Thread on RCUniverse.com] \n* [http://www.rc-forum.de/forumdisplay.php?693-Kyosho-Offroad Kyosho Thread on RC-Forum.de]\n\n=== Works cited ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n\n[[Category:Model cars]]\n[[Category:Kyosho]]\n", "name_user": "Schotte", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMP5 With Picco P6B, item no. 31663P (1996)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyosho_Inferno"}
