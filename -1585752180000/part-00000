The castle was surrounded by a triple ring of forts making its position seemingly impregnable. [[Hasan Sabbah|Hassan-i Sabbah]] and other Nizari leaders often sent their families to this castle for refuge. [[Hulagu Khan]] with 5,000 men started a siege against Girdkuh in 1253. Girdkuh held out against the [[Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia|Mongol invasion of Persia]] for 17 years, and was the last [[Nizari]] stronghold in Persia to surrender to Mongols.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fortress of Girdkuh|url=http://www.iis.ac.uk/view_article.asp?ContentID=105083|publisher=[[Institute of Ismaili Studies]]|accessdate=11 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe fortress probably dates back to the pre-Islamic period. Gerdkuh was situated on the [[Khorasan Road]] and guarded the routes toward the [[Alborz mountain range]]. It was refortified and transferred into the [[Nizari Ismaili state|Nizari Ismaili]] possession in 1100 by [[Ra'is]] Mu'ayyad al-Din Muzaffar ibn A\u1e25mad Mustawfi ({{lang|fa|\u0631\u0626\u06cc\u0633 \u0645\u0624\u06cc\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u0638\u0641\u0631 \u0628\u0646 \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0648\u0641\u06cc}}), a secret Ismaili convert and lieutenant of the Seljuq ''[[amir]]'' Amirdad Habashi ({{lang|fa|\u0627\u0645\u06cc\u0631\u062f\u0627\u062f \u062d\u0628\u0634\u06cc}}), who in turn had acquired Gerkuh in 1096 from Sultan [[Barkiaruq]].
