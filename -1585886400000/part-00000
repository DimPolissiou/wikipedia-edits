This gambit failed when Seitz unexpectedly withdrew his support, and the preselection was instead won by [[Marlene Kairouz]].

[[Zaire]] is renamed the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].\n**The [[Second Congo War]] starts in 1998 in central Africa and includes 50 different cultures and 7 different nations.

President [[Saddam Hussein]] accused [[Kuwait]] of flooding the market with oil and driving down prices. As a result, on 2 August 1990, Iraqi forces [[invasion of Kuwait|invaded and conquered Kuwait]]. The UN immediately condemned the action, and a coalition force led by the United States was sent to the Persian Gulf. Aerial bombing of Iraq began in January 1991 (see also [[Gulf War]]), and a month later, the UN forces drove the Iraqi army from Kuwait in just four days. In the aftermath of the war, the Kurds in the north of Iraq and the Shiites in the south rose up in revolt, and Saddam Hussein barely managed to hold onto power. Until the US invasion in 2003, Iraq was cut off from much of the world.\n*The Chechen wars break out in the 1990s:\n**The [[First Chechen War]] (1994\u20131996) \u2013 the conflict was fought between the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] and the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]]. After the initial campaign of 1994\u20131995, culminating in the devastating [[Battle of Grozny (August 1996)|Battle of Grozny]], Russian federal forces attempted to seize control of the mountainous area of Chechnya but were set back by Chechen [[guerrilla warfare]] and raids on the flatlands in spite of Russia's overwhelming manpower, weaponry, and [[air support]]. The resulting widespread [[morale|demoralization]] of federal forces, and the almost universal opposition of the Russian public to the conflict, led [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s government to declare a [[ceasefire]] in 1996 and sign a [[peace treaty]] a year later.\n**The [[Second Chechen War]] (1999 \u2013 ongoing) \u2013 the war was launched by the [[Russian Federation]] starting 26 August 1999, in response to the [[Invasion of Dagestan (1999)|Invasion of Dagestan]] and the [[Russian apartment bombings]] which were blamed on the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|Chechens]].

A month later the [[Kargil War]] with India results in a political fiasco for Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]], followed by a Pakistani military withdrawal to the [[Line of Control]]. The incident leads to a military [[1999 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] in October, in which Sharif is ousted by [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Army Chief]] [[Pervez Musharraf]].

The [[Siege of Sarajevo]] (1992\u20131995) marked the most violent [[urban warfare]] in Europe since World War II at that time as [[Serbs|Serb]] forces bombard and attack [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] controlled and populated areas of the city. War crimes occur including [[ethnic cleansing]] and destruction of civilian property.\n**The final fighting in Croatian and Bosnian wars ends in 1995 with the success of Croatian military offensives against Serb forces and the mass exodus of [[Serbs]] from Croatia in 1995; Serb losses to Croat and Bosniak forces; and finally the signing of the [[Dayton Agreement]] which internally partitioned Bosnia and Herzegovina into a [[Republika Srpska]] and a [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosniak-Croat federation]].\n*[[Kosovo War]] (1998\u20131999) \u2013 the war between Albanian separatists and Yugoslav military and Serb paramilitary forces in [[Kosovo]] begins in 1996 and escalates in 1998 with increasing reports of atrocities taking place.\n**In 1999, the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) led by the United States launched [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|air attacks]] against [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (then composed of only [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]) to pressure the Yugoslav government to end its military operations against Albanian separatists in [[Kosovo]] due to accusations of war crimes being committed by Yugoslav military forces working alongside nationalist Serb paramilitary groups.

The debate over legalization of marijuana in the United States goes on today.\n*The enactment of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) on 1 January 1994, creating a North American [[free trade]] zone consisting of Canada, Mexico, and the United States.\n\n====Asia====\n=====Middle East=====\n[[File:Bill Clinton, Yitzhak Rabin, Yasser Arafat at the White House 1993-09-13.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Prime Minister of Israel|Israeli Prime Minister]] [[Yitzhak Rabin]], [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Bill Clinton]], and [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) Chairman [[Yasser Arafat]] during the signing of the [[Oslo Accords]] on 13 September 1993.]]\n*In 1990, the ending of the civil war and the return to political normalcy in [[Lebanon]] began. With the peace among all factions in Lebanon, the rebuilding of Lebanon and its capital, Beirut, started.\n*[[Israel]]i Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] and [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] Prime Minister [[Yasser Arafat]] agree to the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process]] at the culmination of the [[Oslo Accords]], negotiated by the [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Bill Clinton]] on 13 September 1993. By signing the Oslo accords, the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] recognize Israel's right to exist, while Israel permitted the creation of an autonomous [[Palestinian National Authority]] consisting of the [[Gaza Strip]] and [[West Bank]] which was implemented in 1994. Israeli military forces withdraw from the Palestinian territories in compliance with the accord, which marked the end of the [[First Intifada]] (a period of violence between Palestinian Arab militants and Israeli armed forces from 1987 to 1993).\n*The [[Palestinian National Authority]] is created in 1994 in accordance with the Oslo Accords, giving Palestinian Arab people official autonomy over the [[Gaza Strip]] and [[West Bank]], though not official independence from [[Israel]].\n*In 1994, a peace treaty is signed between [[Israel]] and [[Jordan]].\n*[[North Yemen]] and [[South Yemen]] merge to form [[Yemen]] in 1991.\n\n=====Far East=====\n*[[Lee Kuan Yew]] relinquished prime-ministership of [[Singapore]] on 28 November 1990, a position he held since 1959, to [[Goh Chok Tong]]. He remained in the cabinet as Senior Minister.\n*In July 1994, North Korean leader [[Kim Il-sung]] died, having ruled the country since its founding in 1948. His son [[Kim Jong-il]] succeeded him, taking over a nation on the brink of complete economic collapse. Famine caused a great number of deaths in the late '90s, and [[North Korea]] would gain a reputation for being a large source of money laundering, counterfeiting, and weapons proliferation. The country's ability to produce and sell nuclear weapons became a focus of concern in the international community.\n*[[Aung San Suu Kyi]]'s [[National League for Democracy]] in Burma wins a majority of seats in the first free elections in 30 years in 1990, yet the Burmese [[military junta]] refuses to relinquish power, beginning an ongoing peaceful struggle throughout the 1990s to the present by Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters to demand the end of military rule in Burma.\n*In the [[Philippines]] two Presidents were elected, [[Fidel V. Ramos]] in 1992 and [[Joseph Estrada]] in 1998.\n*Indonesian president [[Suharto]] resigned after ruling for 32 years (1966\u20131998).\n\n====Europe====\n*The improvement in relations between the countries of [[NATO]] and the former members of the [[Warsaw Pact]] ended the [[Cold War]] both in Europe and other parts of the world.\n*[[German reunification]] \u2013 Germany reunified on 3 October 1990 as a result of the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and after integrating the economic structure and provincial governments, focused on modernization of the former communist East. People who were brought up in a socialist culture became integrated with those living in capitalist western Germany.\n*[[Margaret Thatcher]], who had been the United Kingdom's Prime Minister since 1979, resigned as Prime Minister on 22 November 1990 after being challenged for the leadership of the Conservative Party by [[Michael Heseltine]]. This was because of widespread opposition to the introduction of the controversial [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Community Charge]], and the fact that her key allies such as [[Nigel Lawson]] and [[Geoffrey Howe]] resigned over the deeply sensitive issues of the [[Maastricht Treaty]] and Margaret Thatcher's resistance to Britain joining the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. Less than two years later on the infamous [[Black Wednesday]] of September 1992, the [[pound sterling]] crashed out of the system after the pound fell below the agreed exchange rate with the [[Deutsche Mark]].\n*[[John Major]] replaces [[Margaret Thatcher]] as Prime Minister in 1990.\n*The [[Perestroika|restructuring]] of the Soviet Union destabilizes, as nationalist and separatist demagogues gain popularity. [[Boris Yeltsin]], then [[Chairmen of the Central Executive Committee of the All-Russian Congress of Soviets|chairman]] of the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia|Supreme Soviet]] of [[Russian SFSR|Russia]], resigns from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] and becomes the opposition leader against [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. The Communist Party loses its status as the governing force of the country and is banned after a [[August Putsch|coup attempt]] by Communist hardliners attempted to revert the effects of Gorbachev's policies. Yeltsin's counter-revolution is victorious on 25 December 1991 with the resignation of Gorbachev from presidency and the [[dissolution of the USSR]]. Yeltsin became president of the successor Russian Federation and presided over a period of political unrest, economic crisis, and social anarchy. On 31 December 1999, Yeltsin resigned leaving [[Vladimir Putin]] as acting president.\n*The [[European Union]] forms in 1992 under the [[Maastricht Treaty]].\n*The [[Downing Street Declaration]] 15 December 1993 by the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], [[John Major]], and the [[Taoiseach]] of Ireland, [[Albert Reynolds]] at the British Prime Minister's office in [[10 Downing Street]]. It affirmed both the right of the people of Ireland to [[self-determination]], and that [[Northern Ireland]] would be transferred to the [[Republic of Ireland]] from the United Kingdom only if a majority of its population was in favour of such a move. It included, as part of the prospective of the so-called \"Irish dimension\", the [[principle of consent]] that the people of the island of Ireland, had the exclusive right to solve the issues between North and South by mutual consent.<ref>\nPeatling, Gary (2004).

The joint declaration also pledged the governments to seek a peaceful constitutional settlement, and promised that parties linked with paramilitaries (such as [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]) could take part in the talks, so long as they abandoned violence.<ref>Cox & Guelke, pp. 487\u2013488</ref>\n*The [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] agreed to a truce in 1994. This marked the beginning of the end of 25 years of violence between the IRA and the United Kingdom, and the start of political negotiations.\n*[[Tony Blair]] becomes Prime Minister in 1997 following the [[1997 United Kingdom general election]].\n*The [[Belfast Agreement]] (a.k.a. the Good Friday Agreement) is signed by U.K. and Irish politicians on 10 April 1998, declaring a joint commitment to a peaceful resolution of the territorial dispute between [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the United Kingdom over [[Northern Ireland]]. The [[1998 Northern Ireland Good Friday Agreement referendum]] was held on 22 May 1998. There was a large majority of 'Yes'. A total of 1,738 ballots were spoiled.

Four bullets hit Wallace.\n*15 July 1997 [[Gianni Versace]] was shot dead, aged 50, on the steps of his Miami Beach mansion as he returned from a morning walk on Ocean Drive. He was murdered by [[Andrew Cunanan]], who was also liable in murdering four others including [[Lee Miglin]], a real estate developer and Chicago tycoon two months prior, and used the same gun to commit suicide on a houseboat several days later.

High-income countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, and those in Western Europe experienced steady economic growth for much of the decade. However, in the [[post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]] GDP decreased as their economies restructured to produce goods they needed and some [[capital flight]] occurred.\n*[[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|GATT]] update and creation of the [[World Trade Organization]] and other global economic institutions, but opposition by anti-globalization activists showed up in nearly every GATT summit, like the demonstrations in [[Seattle]] in December 1999.\n*The [[anti-globalization movement|anti-globalization]] protests at the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] began on 30 November 1999. This marks the beginning of a steady increase in anti-globalization protests which occurred in the first decade of the 21st century as well as increasing hostility to [[neoliberalism]].\n\n'''North America'''\n[[File:Dow jones.png|thumb|right|228px|The [[Dow Jones Industrial Average|Dow Jones Index]] of the 1990s.]]\n*The decade is seen as a time of great prosperity in the United States, largely due to the unexpected advent of the Internet and the explosion of technology industries that came with it. The United States economy experiences its longest period of peace time economic expansion during the decade beginning in 1991. Personal incomes doubled from the recession in 1990, and there was higher productivity overall. The [[Wall Street]] [[stock exchange]] stayed over the 10,500 mark from 1999 to 2001.\n*After the 1992 booming of the US [[stock market]], [[Alan Greenspan]] coined the phrase \"[[irrational exuberance]]\".\n*The [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), which phases out trade barriers between the United States, Mexico, and Canada is signed into law by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]].\n\n'''Asia'''\n*The government of the People's Republic of China announces major privatization of state-owned industries in September 1997.\n*China entered the '90s in a turbulent period, shunned by much of the world after the [[Tiananmen Square]] [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Massacre]] and controlled by hard line politicians who reigned in private enterprise and attempted to revive old-fashioned propaganda campaigns. Relations with the United States deteriorated sharply, and the Chinese leadership was further embarrassed by the disintegration of communism in Europe. In 1992, [[Deng Xiaoping]] travelled to southern China in his last major public appearance to revitalize faith in market economics and stop the country's slide back into [[Maoism]]. Afterwards, China recovered, and would experience explosive economic growth during the rest of the decade. In spite of this, dissent continued to be suppressed, and CPC General Secretary [[Jiang Zemin]] launched a brutal crackdown against the [[Falun Gong]] religious sect in 1999. Deng Xiaoping himself died in 1997 at the age of 93. Relations with the US deteriorated again in 1999 after the bombing of the Chinese embassy during the bombing of Serbia by NATO forces, which caused three deaths, and allegations of Chinese espionage at the Los Alamos Nuclear Facility.\n*[[1997 Asian Financial Crisis|Financial crisis]] hits [[East Asia|East]] and Southeast Asia in 1997 and 1998 after a long period of phenomenal economic development, which continues by 1999. This crisis begins to be felt by the end of the decade.\n*In Japan, after three decades of economic growth put them in second place in the world's economies, the situation worsened after 1993. The recession went on into the early first decade of the 21st century, bringing an end to the seemingly unlimited prosperity that the country had hitherto enjoyed.\n*Less affluent nations such as India, [[Malaysia]], and [[Vietnam]] also saw tremendous improvements in economic prosperity and quality of life during the 1990s. Restructuring following the end of the Cold War was beginning. However, there was also the continuation of terrorism in [[Third World]] regions that were once the \"frontlines\" for American and Soviet foreign politics, particularly in Asia.\n\n[[File:Boris Yeltsin with Bill Clinton-1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Boris Yeltsin]] and [[Bill Clinton]] share a laugh in October 1995.]]\n\n'''Europe'''\n*By 1990, Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s reforms were causing major inflation and economic chaos. A coup attempt by hard-liners in August 1991 failed, marking the effective end of the Soviet Union. All its constituent republics declared their independence in 1991, and on Christmas, Gorbachev resigned from office. After 73 years, the Soviet Union had ceased to exist. The new Russian Federation was headed by [[Boris Yeltsin]], and would face severe economic difficulty. Oligarchs took over Russia's energy and industrial sectors, reducing almost half the country to poverty. With a 3% approval rating, Yeltsin had to buy the support of the oligarchs to win reelection in 1996. Economic turmoil and devaluation of the ruble continued, and with heart and alcohol troubles, he stepped down from office on the last day of 1999, handing power to Vladimir Putin.\n*Russian financial crisis in the 1990s results in mass hyperinflation and prompts economic intervention from the [[International Monetary Fund]] and western countries to help Russia's economy recover.\n*The first [[McDonald's]] restaurant opens in Moscow in 1990 with then-President of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR and future Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] attending, symbolizing Russia's transition towards a capitalist [[free market]] economy and a move towards adopting elements of western culture.\n*Oil and gas were discovered in many countries in the former Soviet bloc, leading to economic growth and wider adoption of trade between nations. These trends were also fueled by inexpensive fossil energy, with low petroleum prices caused by a glut of oil. Political stability and decreased militarization due to the winding down of the [[Cold War]] led to economic development and higher standards of living for many citizens.\n*Most of Europe enjoyed growing prosperity during the '90s. However, problems including the massive 1995 general strikes in France following a recession and the difficulties associated with [[German reunification]] lead to sluggish growth in these countries. However, both the French and German economies improve in the latter half of the decade. Meanwhile, the economies of particularly Spain, [[Scandinavia]] and former [[Eastern Bloc]] countries accelerate at rapid speed during the decade although unemployment being mild due to many having experienced a deep recession for the start of the decade.\n*After the [[early 1990s recession]], the United Kingdom and [[Celtic Tiger|Ireland]] experience rapid economic growth and falling unemployment that continues throughout the decade. Economic growth would continue until the [[Late 2000s recession]] marking the longest uninterrupted period of economic growth in history.\n*Some Eastern European economies struggled after the fall of communism, but Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] saw healthy economic growth rates in the late 1990s.\n*With the creation of the EU there is [[freedom of movement]] between member states, such as the 1992 and 1995 free trade agreements.\n*The Euro is adopted by the European Union on 1 January 1999, which begins a process of phasing out national currencies of EU countries.\n\n'''South America'''\n*The sluggish economies of Brazil, by a new emphasis on free markets for all their citizens, and Mexico, under economist president [[Ernesto Zedillo]] elected in 1994, were in their best shape by the late 1990s.\n\n==Technology and science==\n{{Main|1990s in science and technology}}\n\n===Technology===\n{{See also|Timeline of computing 1990\u20131999}}\nThe 1990s were a revolutionary decade for digital technology.

[[General Motors]] continued to suffer huge losses thanks to an inefficient structure, stale designs, and poor quality. Sales improved with the economy by the mid-1990s, but GM's US market share gradually declined to less than 40% (from a peak of 50% in the 1970s). While the new [[Saturn Corporation|Saturn]] division fared well, [[Oldsmobile]] declined sharply, and attempts to remake the division as a European-style luxury car were unsuccessful.\n\nCars in the 1990s had a rounder, more streamlined shape than those from the 1970s and 1980s; this style would continue early into the 2000s and to a lesser extent later on.\n\n[[Chrysler]] ran into financial troubles again as the 1990s started. Like GM, the company too had a stale model lineup (except for the best-selling [[Chrysler minivans|minivans]]) that was largely based on the aging [[Chrysler K platform|K-car platform]]. In 1992, chairman [[Lee Iacocca]] retired, and the company began a remarkable revival, introducing the new [[Chrysler LH platform|LH platform]] and \"Cab-Forward\" styling, along with a highly successful redesign of the full-sized [[Dodge Ram]] in 1994. Chrysler's minivans continued to dominate the market despite increasing competition. In 1998, [[Daimler-Benz]] (the parent company of [[Mercedes-Benz]]) merged with Chrysler. The following year, it was decided to retire [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]], which had been on a long decline since the 1970s. [[Ford]] continued to fare well in the 1990s, with the [[Ford Taurus (second generation)|second]] and [[Ford Taurus (third generation)|third]] generations of the [[Ford Taurus]] being named the best selling car in the United States from 1992 to 1996. However, the Taurus would be outsold and dethroned by the [[Toyota Camry]] starting in 1997, which became the best selling car in the United States for the rest of the decade and into the 2000s. Ford also introduced the Ford Explorer, 1991 being the first model year. Fords Explorer became the best selling SUV on the market; out selling both the Chevy Blazer and Jeep Cherokee\n\nJapanese cars continued to be highly successful during the decade. The [[Honda Accord]] vied with the Taurus most years for being the best-selling car in the United States during the early part of the decade. Although launched in 1989, the luxury brands [[Lexus]] and [[Infiniti]] began car sales of 1990 model year vehicles and saw great success. Lexus would go on to outsell Mercedes-Benz and BMW in the United States by 1991, and would outsell Cadillac and Lincoln by the end of the decade. SUVs and trucks became hugely popular during the economic boom in the second half of the decade. Many makes that had never built a truck before started selling SUVs. Car styling during the 1990s became gradually more round and ovoid, the [[Ford Taurus (third generation)|third-generation Taurus]] and [[Mercury Sable]] being some of the more extreme examples. Safety features such as [[airbag]]s and shoulder belts became mandatory equipment on new cars.\n\n===Science===\n[[File:Dollyscotland (crop).jpg|thumb|[[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly the sheep]] is the first mammal to be [[cloned]] from an adult [[somatic cell]].]]\n[[File:Hubble 01.jpg|thumb|[[Hubble Space Telescope]].]]\n*Physicists develop [[M-theory]].\n*Detection of [[extrasolar planet]]s orbiting [[star]]s other than the sun.\n*In the United Kingdom, the first [[cloning|cloned]] mammal, [[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly the sheep]] was confirmed by the [[Roslin Institute]], and was reported by global media on 26 February 1997.

The transformation from forest to farm is evident by the paler square shaped areas under development.]]\nAt the beginning of the decade, [[sustainable development]] and [[environmental protection]] became serious issues for governments and the international community. In 1987, the publication of the [[Brundtland Report]] by the United Nations had paved the way to establish an [[environmental governance]]. In 1992 the [[Earth Summit]] was held in Rio de Janeiro, in which several countries [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development|committed]] to protect the environment, signing a [[Convention on Biological Diversity]].\n\nThe prevention of the destruction of the [[tropical rainforests]] of the world is a major environmental cause that first came into wide public concern in the early 1990s, and has continued and accelerated.\n\nThe [[Chernobyl disaster]] had [[Cultural impact of the Chernobyl disaster|significant impact on public opinion]] at the end of the 1980s, and the fallout was still causing cancer deaths well into the 1990s and possibly even into the 21st century.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} All along the 1990s, several [[environmental movement|environmental NGOs]] helped improve [[environmental awareness]] among public opinion and governments. The most famous of these organizations during this decade was [[Greenpeace]], which did not hesitate to lead illegal actions in the name of environmental preservation. These organizations also drawn attention on the [[Deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest|large deforestion]] of the [[Amazon Rainforest]] during the period.\n\n[[Global warming]] as an aspect of [[climate change]] also became a major concern, and the creation of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) after the Earth Summit helped coordinate efforts to reduce carbon emissions in the atmosphere. From 1995, the UNFCCC held annual summits on climate change, leading to the adoption of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] in December 1997, a binding agreement signed by several developed countries.\n\n==Society==\nThe 1990s represented continuing social liberalization in most countries, though coupled with an increase in the influence of capitalism, which would continue until the [[Great Recession]] of the late 2000s/early 2010s.\n\n[[Youth subculture|Youth culture]] in the 1990s responded to this by embracing ''both'' environmentalism and [[entrepreneurship]]. Western world fashions reflected this by often turning highly [[individualism|individualistic]] and/or [[counterculture|counter-cultural]], which was influenced by [[Generation X]] and [[Millennials|Generation Y/Millennials]]: [[tattoo]]s and [[body piercing]] gained popularity, and \"retro\" styles inspired by fashions of the 1960s and 1970s were also prevalent. Some young people became increasingly involved in [[extreme sports]] and outdoor activities that combined embracing athletics with the appreciation of nature.\n\nThose born in the 1990s are usually considered part of the [[Millennials|Millennial Generation]], along with those born in the late 1970s and 1980s. However, dates vary, with many demographers considering those born from 1995 onward as part of [[Generation Z]], the post-Millennial generation.<ref name=\"McCrindleAU\">[http://mccrindle.com.au/resources/whitepapers/McCrindle-Research_ABC-01_Generations-Defined_Mark-McCrindle.pdf Generations Defined] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616232732/http://mccrindle.com.au/resources/whitepapers/McCrindle-Research_ABC-01_Generations-Defined_Mark-McCrindle.pdf |date=16 June 2016 }}.

In the United States the [[Violence Against Women Act]] was passed, which greatly affected the world community through the United Nations. The law's author, [[Joe Biden]], and UN Ambassador and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and Hillary Clinton (see below) become vocal advocates of action against violence against women.\n*Women reach great heights of power in the United States government. [[Hillary Clinton]], leading policy proposals, traveling abroad as a State Department representative to 82 nations, advising her husband, and being elected a [[United States Senate|Senator]] (in 2000), is the most openly empowered and politically powerful [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] in American history; [[Madeleine Albright]] and [[Janet Reno]] take two of [[United States Cabinet|the cabinet]]'s top jobs as [[United States Secretary of State]] (#1), and [[United States Attorney General]] (#4), respectively.

Popular American contemporary R&B artists included [[Celine Dion]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[D'Angelo]], [[Lauryn Hill]], [[Whitney Houston]], [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]], [[Sade (band)|Sade]], [[En Vogue]], [[TLC (band)|TLC]], [[Destiny's Child]], [[Toni Braxton]], [[Boyz II Men]], [[Dru Hill]] and [[Vanessa L. Williams]].\n\nThe [[Tibetan Freedom Concert]] brought 120,000 people together in the interest of increased human rights and autonomy for [[Tibet]] from China. [[Freddie Mercury]], [[Kurt Cobain]], [[Selena]], [[Tupac Shakur]] and [[the Notorious B.I.G.]] are the most publicized music-related deaths of the decade, in 1991, 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997 respectively.\n\n[[Richey Edwards]] of [[Manic Street Preachers]] was publicized in the media in 1991 following an incident involving [[Steve Lamacq]] backstage after a live show, in which Edwards carved '4 Real' into his arm. Edwards disappeared in 1995, which was highly publicized. He is still missing, but was presumed dead in 2008.\n\nControversy surrounded [[the Prodigy]] with the release of the track \"[[Smack My Bitch Up]]\". The National Organization for Women (NOW) claimed that the track was \"advocating violence against women\" due to the lyrics of that song. The music video (directed by Jonas \u00c5kerlund) featured a first-person POV of someone going clubbing, indulging in drugs and alcohol, getting into fist fights, abusing women and picking up a prostitute. At the end of the video the camera pans over to a mirror, revealing the subject to be a woman.\n\n1994 became a breakthrough year for [[punk rock in California]], with the success of bands like [[Bad Religion]], [[Social Distortion]], [[Blink-182]], [[Green Day]], [[the Offspring]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] and similar groups following. This success would continue to grow over the next decade, the 2000s.

One show stood out as a critical and ratings success for [[NBC]]. In 1994, ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', which starred [[Anthony Edwards]] and [[George Clooney]], was a domestic and international success, lasting until 2009 and spawning series such as ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' (2005\u2013present). It made [[NBC]] the most watched channel in the United States.{{citation needed|date= March 2011}} This show launched the career of [[George Clooney]]. That same year, ''[[Chicago Hope]]'', that starred [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]], [[Mandy Patinkin]] and [[Adam Arkin]], was also a popular series for [[CBS]], lasting between 1994 and 2000.\n\n''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' ran on Fox from 1990 to 2000.

The show was then remade and renamed simply ''[[90210 (TV series)|90210]]'' and premiered in 2008. ''Beverly Hills, 90210'' spun-off ''[[Melrose Place]]'', a popular TV show that dominated throughout the '90s as well. ''[[Baywatch]]'', a popular TV show that dominated throughout the '90s, became the most watched TV show in history and influenced pop culture.\n\n''[[Sex and the City]]'''s frank portrayal of relationships and sexuality caused controversy and acclaim, leading to a new generation of sexually progressive television shows that would be seen in the 2000s.\n\nFantasy was popular on television, with CBS airing ''[[Touched By an Angel]]'', beginning in 1994. The series was intended as the comeback vehicle of [[Della Reese]], and also launched the career of [[Roma Downey]]. It wasn't an immediate hit, and was canceled the following year, but revived the following year, thanks to die hard fans who approached a letter-writing campaign, where it ran for 8 more seasons.\n\nCrime drama and police detective shows returned after soap-operas died down.

The show has aired more than 600 episodes and has become an institution of pop culture. It has spawned the adult-oriented [[animated sitcom]] genre, inspiring racier shows such as ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'' (1993\u20131997), ''[[Daria]]'' (1997\u20132001), along with ''[[South Park]]'' and ''[[Family Guy]]'', the latter two of which began in 1997 and 1999 respectively and continue to air new episodes through the 2000s and into the 2010s.\n\n[[Anime]] was popular in the 1980s, and expanded to a worldwide audience by the 1990s, for its expansive spectrum of story subjects and themes not limited to comedy and superhero action found in the US, and well produced, and well written, visual and story content, that held emotional and intellectual depth and integrity to its viewers, and which also expanded to older and adult ages in the medium of [[animation]].

''[[Tomb Raider]]''{{'}}s (PlayStation) [[Lara Croft]] became a video game sex symbol, becoming a recognizable figure in the entertainment industry throughout the late 1990s.\n\n[[3D computer graphics|3-D]] graphics become the standard by end of decade. Although [[First-person shooter|FPSs]] had long since seen the transition to full 3D, other genres begin to copy this trend by the end of the decade. Most notable first shooter games in the 1990s are ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]'' and ''[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six (video game)|Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six]]''.\n\nThe [[console wars]], primarily between [[Sega]] (Mega Drive, marketed as the [[Sega Genesis]] in North America, introduced in 1988) and [[Nintendo]] ([[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], introduced in 1990), sees the entrance of [[Sony]] with the [[PlayStation]] in 1994, which becomes the first successful CD-based console (as opposed to [[ROM cartridge|cartridges]]).

Hundreds of knock-offs are widely popular in the mid-to-late 1990s. ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' (1993) bursts onto the world scene, and instantly popularizes the [[First-person shooter|FPS]] genre. ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' (1998) features the next evolutionary step in the genre with continual progression of the game (no levels in the traditional sense) and an entirely in-person view, and becomes one of the most popular computer games in history.\n\nThe [[real-time strategy]] (RTS) genre is introduced in 1992 with the release of ''[[Dune II]]''. ''[[Warcraft: Orcs & Humans]]'' (1994) popularizes the genre, with ''[[Command & Conquer]]'' and ''[[Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness]]'' in 1995, setting up the first major real-time strategy competition and popularizing multiplayer capabilities in RTS games. ''[[StarCraft]]'' in 1998 becomes the second best-selling computer game of all time. It remains among the most popular multiplayer RTS games to this day, especially in [[South Korea]]. ''[[Homeworld]]'' in 1999 becomes the first successful 3d RTS game. The rise of the RTS genre is often credited with the fall of the [[turn-based strategy]] (TBS) genre, popularized with ''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]'' in 1991. ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'' debuted (in North America) in 1990 for the NES, and remains among the most popular video game [[Final Fantasy|franchises]], with many new titles to date and more in development, plus numerous spin-offs, sequels, films and related titles. ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', released in 1997, especially popularized the series.\n\n[[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s (MMORPGs) see their entrance into the computer game world with ''[[Ultima Online]]'' in 1997, although they don't gain widespread popularity until ''[[EverQuest]]'' and ''[[Asheron's Call]]'' in 1999. MMORPGs go on to become among the most popular genres in the first decade of the 21st century.\n\n''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'' enters the world scene with the release of the original [[Game Boy]] ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|Pok\u00e9mon Red]]'' and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|Pok\u00e9mon Green]]'' games in Japan in 1996, later changed to ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|Pok\u00e9mon Red]]'' and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue|Pok\u00e9mon Blue]]'' for worldwide release in 1998. It soon becomes popular in the United States, spurring the term Pok\u00e9mania and is adapted into a popular [[anime]] series and [[trading card]] game, among other media forms.\n\n''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]'' is released in 1996. It becomes the most popular survival-horror series in video gaming well into the next decade and inspires several films.\n\n''[[Crash Bandicoot (video game)|Crash Bandicoot]]'' is released in September 1996, becoming an innovative platformer for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"190\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Game-Boy-FL.jpg|Nintendo's '''[[Game Boy]]''' was a popular handheld game console during the 1990s.\nFile:PSX-Console-wController.png|The '''[[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]''' was released in the mid-1990s and became the [[List of million-selling game consoles|best-selling gaming console]] of its time.\nFile:Diana Maria (cropped).jpg|The game '''''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)|Tomb Raider]]''''', launched in 1996, became particularly popular during the decade and as a result [[Lara Croft]]'s character eventually became a cultural icon in the video game industry\nFile:Mittelgrosse_lan-party.jpg|Private '''[[LAN parties]]''' were at the peak of their popularity in the late 90s and early 2000s when broadband Internet access was unavailable or too expensive for most people\n</gallery>\n\n=== Internet ===\n* '''Prominent websites / apps launched during the decade:''' [[IMDb]] (1993), [[EBay]] (1995), [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] (1994), [[GeoCities]] (1994), [[Netscape]] (1994), [[Yahoo!]] (1995), [[AltaVista]] (1995), [[ICQ]] (1996), [[Hotmail]] (1996), [[Google]] (1998), [[Napster]] (1999)\n* The pioneering peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing internet service '''[[Napster]]''', which was first launched in the fall of 1999, was the first peer-to-peer software to become massively popular. While at the time it was possible to share files in other ways via the Internet (such as [[IRC]] and [[USENET]]), Napster was the first software to focus exclusively on sharing MP3 files. Napster was eventually forced to shutdown in July 2001 to prevent further copyright violations.\n\n===Architecture===\n{{Further|:Category:1990s architecture}}\n[[File:Twin Towers in all its Glory.JPG|thumb|right|120px|The [[Petronas Twin Towers]] were the world's tallest buildings when completed in 1999.]]\n*The [[Petronas Towers|Petronas Twin Towers]] became two of the [[List of tallest buildings and structures in the world|tallest man-made structures]] ever built after they officially opened on 31 August 1999.\n\n===Sports===\n\n[[File:Blue Jays Win the 1993 World Series.jpg|250px|thumb|Fireworks in the [[SkyDome]] after [[Joe Carter]]'s [[1993 World Series|World Series]]-winning home run, as the Canadian [[Toronto Blue Jays]] won their second straight [[World Series]] title in 1993 against the US' [[Philadelphia Phillies]].]]\n*The [[1992 Summer Olympics]] are held in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]].\n*[[Major League Baseball]] players went on [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|strike]] on 12 August 1994, thus ending the season and canceling the [[World Series]] for the first time in 90 years.

The series would go all seven games won by the home teams that concluded in dramatic fashion with the Minnesota Twins claiming their second World Series title.\n*American NBA basketball player [[Michael Jordan]] became a major sports and pop culture icon idolized by millions worldwide. He revolutionized sports marketing through deals with companies such as [[Gatorade]], [[Hanes]], [[McDonald's]] and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]. His Chicago Bulls team won six NBA titles during the decade ([[1991 NBA Finals|1991]], [[1992 NBA Finals|1992]], [[1993 NBA Finals|1993]], [[1996 NBA Finals|1996]], [[1997 NBA Finals|1997]] and [[1998 NBA Finals|1998]]). He was loved outside basketball thanks to his self-portrayal in the film ''[[Space Jam]]'' with the ''[[Looney Tunes|Looney Tune]]'' characters.\n*The [[National Hockey League]] would expand from 21 to 30 teams.

The NHL also returned to Atlanta with the expansion [[Atlanta Thrashers]].\n*Two of the NHL's [[Original Six]] teams, the [[New York Rangers]] and the [[Detroit Red Wings]] would end long [[Stanley Cup]] championship droughts; the Rangers in [[1994 Stanley Cup Finals|1994]] after [[Curse of 1940|54 years]], and the Red Wings would win back to back Cups in [[1997 Stanley Cup Finals|1997]] and [[1998 Stanley Cup Finals|1998]] after [[1955 Stanley Cup Finals|42 years]].\n*Canadian hockey star [[Mario Lemieux]] led the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], one of the original NHL expansion teams, to back-to-back Stanley Cup championships in [[1991 Stanley Cup Finals|1991]] and [[1992 Stanley Cup Finals|1992]].\n*In addition to the Pittsburgh Penguins, three other NHL expansion teams went on to earn their first Stanley Cup championships: the [[New Jersey Devils]] in [[1995 Stanley Cup Finals|1995]], the Colorado Avalanche in [[1996 Stanley Cup Finals|1996]], and the Dallas Stars in [[1999 Stanley Cup Finals|1999]].\n*Canadian hockey star [[Wayne Gretzky]] announced his retirement from the NHL in 1999. Upon his final game on 18 April, he held forty regular-season records, fifteen playoff records, and six All-Star records. He is the leading point-scorer in NHL history, as well as the only NHL player to total over 200 points in one season \u2013 a feat he accomplished four times. In addition, he tallied over 100 points in 16 professional seasons, 14 of them consecutive. He played for four teams during his NHL career: the [[Edmonton Oilers]], the [[Los Angeles Kings]], the [[St. Louis Blues]], and the New York Rangers.\n*American cyclist [[Lance Armstrong]] won his first [[Tour de France]] in 1999, less than two years after battling [[testicular cancer]].\n*In [[professional wrestling]], the [[1980s professional wrestling boom|boom period]] of the [[WWE|WWF]] from the late 1980s continued until 1993, led by such stars as [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[The Ultimate Warrior]]. A second boom period of the decade was introduced during the [[Monday Night Wars]] between the WWF and [[WCW]] from the middle of the decade to spawn the WWF's [[Attitude Era]], home to some of the biggest names in Wrestling history such as [[The Undertaker]], who would go on to have an [[The Streak (wrestling)|undefeated streak at WrestleMania]] that would go on until [[WrestleMania XXX]] in April 2014, [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] and the highly popular [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] group, along with [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] and [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] who brought WCW major success.\n*[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] won an unprecedented [[treble (association football)|treble]] of the [[Premier League]], [[FA Cup]] and [[1999 UEFA Champions League Final|Champions League]] after defeating [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] 2\u20131 in May 1999.\n*The United States hosted the 15th staging of the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] in 1994.

President [[Saddam Hussein]] accused [[Kuwait]] of flooding the market with oil and driving down prices. As a result, on 2 August 1990, Iraqi forces [[invasion of Kuwait|invaded and conquered Kuwait]]. The UN immediately condemned the action, and a coalition force led by the United States was sent to the Persian Gulf. Aerial bombing of Iraq began in January 1991 (see also [[Gulf War]]), and a month later, the UN forces drove the Iraqi army from Kuwait in just four days. In the aftermath of the war, the Kurds in the north of Iraq and the Shiites in the south rose up in revolt, and Saddam Hussein barely managed to hold onto power. Until the US invasion in 2003, Iraq was cut off from much of the world.\n*The Chechen wars break out in the 1990s:\n**The [[First Chechen War]] (1994\u20131996) \u2013 the conflict was fought between the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] and the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]].

The resulting widespread [[morale|demoralization]] of federal forces, and the almost universal opposition of the Russian public to the conflict, led [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s government to declare a [[ceasefire]] in 1996 and sign a [[peace treaty]] a year later.\n**The [[Second Chechen War]] (1999 \u2013 ongoing) \u2013 the war was launched by the [[Russian Federation]] starting 26 August 1999, in response to the [[Invasion of Dagestan (1999)|Invasion of Dagestan]] and the [[Russian apartment bombings]] which were blamed on the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|Chechens]].

High-income countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, and those in Western Europe experienced steady economic growth for much of the decade. However, in the [[post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]] GDP decreased as their economies restructured to produce goods they needed and some [[capital flight]] occurred.\n*[[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|GATT]] update and creation of the [[World Trade Organization]] and other global economic institutions, but opposition by anti-globalization activists showed up in nearly every GATT summit, like the demonstrations in [[Seattle]] in December 1999.\n*The [[anti-globalization movement|anti-globalization]] protests at the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] began on 30 November 1999. This marks the beginning of a steady increase in anti-globalization protests which occurred in the first decade of the 21st century as well as increasing hostility to [[neoliberalism]].\n\n'''North America'''\n[[File:Dow jones.png|thumb|right|228px|The [[Dow Jones Industrial Average|Dow Jones Index]] of the 1990s.]]\n*The decade is seen as a time of great prosperity in the United States, largely due to the unexpected advent of the Internet and the explosion of technology industries that came with it. The United States economy experiences its longest period of peace time economic expansion during the decade beginning in 1991. Personal incomes doubled from the recession in 1990, and there was higher productivity overall. The [[Wall Street]] [[stock exchange]] stayed over the 10,500 mark from 1999 to 2001.\n*After the 1992 booming of the US [[stock market]], [[Alan Greenspan]] coined the phrase \"[[irrational exuberance]]\".\n*The [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), which phases out trade barriers between the United States, Mexico, and Canada is signed into law by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]].\n\n'''Asia'''\n*The government of the People's Republic of China announces major privatization of state-owned industries in September 1997.\n*China entered the '90s in a turbulent period, shunned by much of the world after the [[Tiananmen Square]] [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Massacre]] and controlled by hard line politicians who reigned in private enterprise and attempted to revive old-fashioned propaganda campaigns. Relations with the United States deteriorated sharply, and the Chinese leadership was further embarrassed by the disintegration of communism in Europe. In 1992, [[Deng Xiaoping]] travelled to southern China in his last major public appearance to revitalize faith in market economics and stop the country's slide back into [[Maoism]]. Afterwards, China recovered, and would experience explosive economic growth during the rest of the decade. In spite of this, dissent continued to be suppressed, and CPC General Secretary [[Jiang Zemin]] launched a brutal crackdown against the [[Falun Gong]] religious sect in 1999. Deng Xiaoping himself died in 1997 at the age of 93. Relations with the US deteriorated again in 1999 after the bombing of the Chinese embassy during the bombing of Serbia by NATO forces, which caused three deaths, and allegations of Chinese espionage at the Los Alamos Nuclear Facility.\n*[[1997 Asian Financial Crisis|Financial crisis]] hits [[East Asia|East]] and Southeast Asia in 1997 and 1998 after a long period of phenomenal economic development, which continues by 1999. This crisis begins to be felt by the end of the decade.\n*In Japan, after three decades of economic growth put them in second place in the world's economies, the situation worsened after 1993. The recession went on into the early first decade of the 21st century, bringing an end to the seemingly unlimited prosperity that the country had hitherto enjoyed.\n*Less affluent nations such as India, [[Malaysia]], and [[Vietnam]] also saw tremendous improvements in economic prosperity and quality of life during the 1990s. Restructuring following the end of the Cold War was beginning. However, there was also the continuation of terrorism in [[Third World]] regions that were once the \"frontlines\" for American and Soviet foreign politics, particularly in Asia.\n\n[[File:Boris Yeltsin with Bill Clinton-1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Boris Yeltsin]] and [[Bill Clinton]] share a laugh in October 1995.]]\n\n'''Europe'''\n*By 1990, Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s reforms were causing major inflation and economic chaos. A coup attempt by hard-liners in August 1991 failed, marking the effective end of the Soviet Union. All its constituent republics declared their independence in 1991, and on Christmas, Gorbachev resigned from office. After 73 years, the Soviet Union had ceased to exist. The new Russian Federation was headed by [[Boris Yeltsin]], and would face severe economic difficulty. Oligarchs took over Russia's energy and industrial sectors, reducing almost half the country to poverty. With a 3% approval rating, Yeltsin had to buy the support of the oligarchs to win reelection in 1996. Economic turmoil and devaluation of the ruble continued, and with heart and alcohol troubles, he stepped down from office on the last day of 1999, handing power to Vladimir Putin.\n*Russian financial crisis in the 1990s results in mass hyperinflation and prompts economic intervention from the [[International Monetary Fund]] and western countries to help Russia's economy recover.\n*The first [[McDonald's]] restaurant opens in Moscow in 1990 with then-President of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR and future Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] attending, symbolizing Russia's transition towards a capitalist [[free market]] economy and a move towards adopting elements of western culture.\n*Oil and gas were discovered in many countries in the former Soviet bloc, leading to economic growth and wider adoption of trade between nations. These trends were also fueled by inexpensive fossil energy, with low petroleum prices caused by a glut of oil. Political stability and decreased militarization due to the winding down of the [[Cold War]] led to economic development and higher standards of living for many citizens.\n*Most of Europe enjoyed growing prosperity during the '90s. However, problems including the massive 1995 general strikes in France following a recession and the difficulties associated with [[German reunification]] lead to sluggish growth in these countries. However, both the French and German economies improve in the latter half of the decade. Meanwhile, the economies of particularly Spain, [[Scandinavia]] and former [[Eastern Bloc]] countries accelerate at rapid speed during the decade although unemployment being mild due to many having experienced a deep recession for the start of the decade.\n*After the [[early 1990s recession]], the United Kingdom and [[Celtic Tiger|Ireland]] experience rapid economic growth and falling unemployment that continues throughout the decade. Economic growth would continue until the [[Late 2000s recession]] marking the longest uninterrupted period of economic growth in history.\n*Some Eastern European economies struggled after the fall of communism, but Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] saw healthy economic growth rates in the late 1990s.\n*With the creation of the EU there is [[freedom of movement]] between member states, such as the 1992 and 1995 free trade agreements.\n*The Euro is adopted by the European Union on 1 January 1999, which begins a process of phasing out national currencies of EU countries.\n\n'''South America'''\n*The sluggish economies of Brazil, by a new emphasis on free markets for all their citizens, and Mexico, under economist president [[Ernesto Zedillo]] elected in 1994, were in their best shape by the late 1990s.\n\n==Technology and science==\n{{Main|1990s in science and technology}}\n\n===Technology===\n{{See also|Timeline of computing 1990\u20131999}}\nThe 1990s were a revolutionary decade for digital technology.

[[General Motors]] continued to suffer huge losses thanks to an inefficient structure, stale designs, and poor quality. Sales improved with the economy by the mid-1990s, but GM's US market share gradually declined to less than 40% (from a peak of 50% in the 1970s). While the new [[Saturn Corporation|Saturn]] division fared well, [[Oldsmobile]] declined sharply, and attempts to remake the division as a European-style luxury car were unsuccessful.\n\nCars in the 1990s had a rounder, more streamlined shape than those from the 1970s and 1980s; this style would continue early into the 2000s and to a lesser extent later on.\n\n[[Chrysler]] ran into financial troubles again as the 1990s started. Like GM, the company too had a stale model lineup (except for the best-selling [[Chrysler minivans|minivans]]) that was largely based on the aging [[Chrysler K platform|K-car platform]]. In 1992, chairman [[Lee Iacocca]] retired, and the company began a remarkable revival, introducing the new [[Chrysler LH platform|LH platform]] and \"Cab-Forward\" styling, along with a highly successful redesign of the full-sized [[Dodge Ram]] in 1994. Chrysler's minivans continued to dominate the market despite increasing competition. In 1998, [[Daimler-Benz]] (the parent company of [[Mercedes-Benz]]) merged with Chrysler. The following year, it was decided to retire [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]], which had been on a long decline since the 1970s. [[Ford]] continued to fare well in the 1990s, with the [[Ford Taurus (second generation)|second]] and [[Ford Taurus (third generation)|third]] generations of the [[Ford Taurus]] being named the best selling car in the United States from 1992 to 1996. However, the Taurus would be outsold and dethroned by the [[Toyota Camry]] starting in 1997, which became the best selling car in the United States for the rest of the decade and into the 2000s. Ford also introduced the Ford Explorer, 1991 being the first model year. Fords Explorer became the best selling SUV on the market; out selling both the Chevy Blazer and Jeep Cherokee\n\nJapanese cars continued to be highly successful during the decade. The [[Honda Accord]] vied with the Taurus most years for being the best-selling car in the United States during the early part of the decade. Although launched in 1989, the luxury brands [[Lexus]] and [[Infiniti]] began car sales of 1990 model year vehicles and saw great success. Lexus would go on to outsell Mercedes-Benz and BMW in the United States by 1991, and would outsell Cadillac and Lincoln by the end of the decade. SUVs and trucks became hugely popular during the economic boom in the second half of the decade. Many makes that had never built a truck before started selling SUVs. Car styling during the 1990s became gradually more round and ovoid, the [[Ford Taurus (third generation)|third-generation Taurus]] and [[Mercury Sable]] being some of the more extreme examples. Safety features such as [[airbag]]s and shoulder belts became mandatory equipment on new cars.\n\n===Science===\n[[File:Dollyscotland (crop).jpg|thumb|[[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly the sheep]] is the first mammal to be [[cloned]] from an adult [[somatic cell]].]]\n[[File:Hubble 01.jpg|thumb|[[Hubble Space Telescope]].]]\n*Physicists develop [[M-theory]].\n*Detection of [[extrasolar planet]]s orbiting [[star]]s other than the sun.\n*In the United Kingdom, the first [[cloning|cloned]] mammal, [[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly the sheep]] was confirmed by the [[Roslin Institute]], and was reported by global media on 26 February 1997.

In 1987, the publication of the [[Brundtland Report]] by the United Nations had paved the way to establish an [[environmental governance]]. In 1992 the [[Earth Summit]] was held in Rio de Janeiro, in which several countries [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development|committed]] to protect the environment, signing a [[Convention on Biological Diversity]].\n\nThe prevention of the destruction of the [[tropical rainforests]] of the world is a major environmental cause that first came into wide public concern in the early 1990s, and has continued and accelerated.\n\nThe [[Chernobyl disaster]] had [[Cultural impact of the Chernobyl disaster|significant impact on public opinion]] at the end of the 1980s, and the fallout was still causing cancer deaths well into the 1990s and possibly even into the 21st century.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} All along the 1990s, several [[environmental movement|environmental NGOs]] helped improve [[environmental awareness]] among public opinion and governments. The most famous of these organizations during this decade was [[Greenpeace]], which did not hesitate to lead illegal actions in the name of environmental preservation. These organizations also drawn attention on the [[Deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest|large deforestion]] of the [[Amazon Rainforest]] during the period.\n\n[[Global warming]] as an aspect of [[climate change]] also became a major concern, and the creation of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) after the Earth Summit helped coordinate efforts to reduce carbon emissions in the atmosphere. From 1995, the UNFCCC held annual summits on climate change, leading to the adoption of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] in December 1997, a binding agreement signed by several developed countries.\n\n==Society==\nThe 1990s represented continuing social liberalization in most countries, though coupled with an increase in the influence of capitalism, which would continue until the [[Great Recession]] of the late 2000s/early 2010s.\n\n[[Youth subculture|Youth culture]] in the 1990s responded to this by embracing ''both'' environmentalism and [[entrepreneurship]]. Western world fashions reflected this by often turning highly [[individualism|individualistic]] and/or [[counterculture|counter-cultural]], which was influenced by [[Generation X]] and [[Millennials|Generation Y/Millennials]]: [[tattoo]]s and [[body piercing]] gained popularity, and \"retro\" styles inspired by fashions of the 1960s and 1970s were also prevalent. Some young people became increasingly involved in [[extreme sports]] and outdoor activities that combined embracing athletics with the appreciation of nature.\n\nThose born in the 1990s are usually considered part of the [[Millennials|Millennial Generation]], along with those born in the late 1970s and 1980s.

[[Freddie Mercury]], [[Kurt Cobain]], [[Selena]], [[Tupac Shakur]] and [[the Notorious B.I.G.]] are the most publicized music-related deaths of the decade, in 1991, 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997 respectively.\n\n[[Richey Edwards]] of [[Manic Street Preachers]] was publicized in the media in 1991 following an incident involving [[Steve Lamacq]] backstage after a live show, in which Edwards carved '4 Real' into his arm. Edwards disappeared in 1995, which was highly publicized. He is still missing, but was presumed dead in 2008.\n\nControversy surrounded [[the Prodigy]] with the release of the track \"[[Smack My Bitch Up]]\". The National Organization for Women (NOW) claimed that the track was \"advocating violence against women\" due to the lyrics of that song. The music video (directed by Jonas \u00c5kerlund) featured a first-person POV of someone going clubbing, indulging in drugs and alcohol, getting into fist fights, abusing women and picking up a prostitute. At the end of the video the camera pans over to a mirror, revealing the subject to be a woman.\n\n1994 became a breakthrough year for [[punk rock in California]], with the success of bands like [[Bad Religion]], [[Social Distortion]], [[Blink-182]], [[Green Day]], [[the Offspring]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] and similar groups following. This success would continue to grow over the next decade, the 2000s. The 1990s also became the most important decade for [[ska punk]]/[[reggae fusion|reggae rock]], with the success of many bands like [[Buck-O-Nine]], [[Goldfinger (band)|Goldfinger]], [[Less Than Jake]], [[the Mighty Mighty Bosstones]], [[Murphy's Law (band)|Murphy's Law]], [[No Doubt]], [[Reel Big Fish]], [[Save Ferris]], [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]] and [[Sugar Ray]].\n\nThe [[rave]] movement that emerged in the late 1980s rose. Rave spawned genres such as [[Intelligent dance music]] and [[Drum and bass]]. The latter is an offshoot of jungle techno and [[Breakbeat hardcore|breakbeat]]. Popular artists included [[Moby]], [[Fatboy Slim]], [[Bj\u00f6rk]], [[Aphex Twin]], [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]], [[the Orb]], [[the Chemical Brothers]], [[Basement Jaxx]], [[Todd Terry]], [[808 State]], [[Primal Scream]], [[the Shamen]], [[the KLF]] and [[the Prodigy]].\n\nThe rise of [[industrial music]], somewhat a fusion of [[synthpop]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], rose to worldwide popularity with bands like [[Godflesh]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Rammstein]], [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] and [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]]. [[Groove metal]] was born through the efforts of [[Pantera]], whose seventh studio album ''[[Far Beyond Driven]]'' (1994) was notable for going number one on [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Another heavy metal subgenre called nu metal, which mixed metal with hip hop influences, becomes popular with bands like [[Korn]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] and [[Limp Bizkit]] selling millions of albums worldwide. [[Metallica]]'s 1991 eponymous album ''[[Metallica (album)|Metallica]]'' is the best-selling album of the [[Soundscan|SoundScan]] era, while [[extreme metal]] acts such as [[Death (metal band)|Death]], [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], [[Darkthrone]], [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]], [[Cannibal Corpse]] and others experienced popularity throughout the decade.\n\nIn the 1990s, country music became a worldwide phenomenon thanks to [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], [[Shania Twain]] and [[Garth Brooks]].<ref name=\"Country Worldwide\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0LYxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_OIFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1510,3298161&dq=billy+ray+cyrus+country+worldwide&hl=en|title=Country is No. 1 musical style|date=19 August 1992|newspaper=Reading Eagle|accessdate=26 July 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Country Worldwide2\">{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TjQfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=B88EAAAAIBAJ&pg=4760,3698051&dq=billy+ray+cyrus+country+worldwide&hl=en|title=Country music reflects the time|date=27 September 1992|publisher=Herald-Journal|accessdate=26 July 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Country Worldwide3\">{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/504338431.html?dids=504338431:504338431&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Nov+25%2C+1993&author=Jack+Hurst&pub=The+Record&desc=Country+music+is+making+waves+across+the+seas&pqatl=google|title=Country music is making waves across the seas|date=25 November 1993|work=The Star|accessdate=26 July 2010|first=Jack|last=Hurst}}</ref> The latter enjoyed one of the most successful careers in popular music history, breaking records for both sales and concert attendance throughout the decade.

Lasting for 9 seasons, the show tackled a wide variety of subjects, and was one of the few shows ever to perform karate.\n\n1993 also saw its debut of the [[medical]]\u2013[[:wikt:mystery|mystery]] drama, ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'', a comeback vehicle for [[Dick Van Dyke]], who guest-starred on an episode of its sequel, ''[[Jake and The Fatman]]'', where the show got off to a rocky start, and became one of television's long-running mysteries, that lasted until its cancelation in 2001.\n\nMedical dramas started to come into television in the '90s. One show stood out as a critical and ratings success for [[NBC]]. In 1994, ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', which starred [[Anthony Edwards]] and [[George Clooney]], was a domestic and international success, lasting until 2009 and spawning series such as ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' (2005\u2013present). It made [[NBC]] the most watched channel in the United States.{{citation needed|date= March 2011}} This show launched the career of [[George Clooney]]. That same year, ''[[Chicago Hope]]'', that starred [[H\u00e9ctor Elizondo]], [[Mandy Patinkin]] and [[Adam Arkin]], was also a popular series for [[CBS]], lasting between 1994 and 2000.\n\n''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' ran on Fox from 1990 to 2000. It established the teen soap genre paving the way for ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'', ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', and other shows airing in later years. The show was then remade and renamed simply ''[[90210 (TV series)|90210]]'' and premiered in 2008. ''Beverly Hills, 90210'' spun-off ''[[Melrose Place]]'', a popular TV show that dominated throughout the '90s as well. ''[[Baywatch]]'', a popular TV show that dominated throughout the '90s, became the most watched TV show in history and influenced pop culture.\n\n''[[Sex and the City]]'''s frank portrayal of relationships and sexuality caused controversy and acclaim, leading to a new generation of sexually progressive television shows that would be seen in the 2000s.\n\nFantasy was popular on television, with CBS airing ''[[Touched By an Angel]]'', beginning in 1994. The series was intended as the comeback vehicle of [[Della Reese]], and also launched the career of [[Roma Downey]]. It wasn't an immediate hit, and was canceled the following year, but revived the following year, thanks to die hard fans who approached a letter-writing campaign, where it ran for 8 more seasons.\n\nCrime drama and police detective shows returned after soap-operas died down. After the successful debuts of ''[[Law & Order]]'', ''[[NYPD Blue]]'' and ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'', ''[[Nash Bridges]]'', a comeback vehicle for [[Don Johnson]], lasting 6 seasons (1996\u20132001) which also dealt with escapist entertainment, rather than tackling issues.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-04-25/entertainment/ca-62314_1_miami-vice|title=With a New Beat and Attitude, the 'Vice' Man Cometh|first=HEATHER|last=McCABE|date=25 April 1996|newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>\n\nReality television began on MTV; this would grow in importance in the western world into the next decade.\n\nDuring the mid-1990s, two of the biggest professional wrestling companies: ''[[World Championship Wrestling]]'' and ''[[World Wrestling Federation]]'' were in a ratings battle that was dubbed the Monday Night Wars (1995\u20132001). Each company fought to draw more viewers to their respective Monday night wrestling show. The \"War\" ended in 2001 when ''[[WWE]]'' bought ''[[WCW]]''. In November 2001, there was a Winner Takes All match with both companies in a Pay-Per-View called ''[[Survivor Series]]''. WWF won the match; putting a final end to WCW.\n\nAs an animated sitcom, ''[[The Simpsons]]'', debuted in December 1989, became a domestic and international success in the 1990s. The show has aired more than 600 episodes and has become an institution of pop culture. It has spawned the adult-oriented [[animated sitcom]] genre, inspiring racier shows such as ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'' (1993\u20131997), ''[[Daria]]'' (1997\u20132001), along with ''[[South Park]]'' and ''[[Family Guy]]'', the latter two of which began in 1997 and 1999 respectively and continue to air new episodes through the 2000s and into the 2010s.\n\n[[Anime]] was popular in the 1980s, and expanded to a worldwide audience by the 1990s, for its expansive spectrum of story subjects and themes not limited to comedy and superhero action found in the US, and well produced, and well written, visual and story content, that held emotional and intellectual depth and integrity to its viewers, and which also expanded to older and adult ages in the medium of [[animation]].

One of Nickelodeon's most popular and longest running series, ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', started in 1999 and became a huge success.\n\nAmerican animated children's programs went through a renaissance during the decade with studios producing many critically acclaimed shows. Specifically ''[[Warner Bros Animation]]'' shows like''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]'', ''[[Animaniacs]]'', ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', and ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''. Also syndicated shows like ''[[Phantom 2040]]''.\n\nThe late 90s also saw the evolution of a new TV genre: primetime game shows, popularized by the game show ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'', hosted by [[Regis Philbin]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], as well as other first-run game shows aired in primetime on the newly launched [[Game Show Network]].\n\n===Fashion===\n{{Main|1990s in fashion}}\n[[File:Jonathan Brandis Wiki.jpg|thumb|right|140px|[[Grunge]]-style flannel shirt and [[curtained hair]]]]\nSignificant fashion trends of the 1990s include:\n*[[Rachel haircut|The Rachel]], [[Jennifer Aniston]]'s hairstyle on the hit show ''[[Friends]]'', became a cultural phenomenon with millions of women copying it worldwide.\n*The [[Curtained hair|Curtained Haircut]] increased in popularity in fashion and culture among teenage boys and young men in the 1990s, mainly after it was popularized in the film ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' by the actor [[Edward Furlong]].\n*The model 1300 [[Wonderbra]] style has a resurgence of popularity in Europe in 1992 which kicks off a multinational media sensation, the 1994 re-introduction of \"The Wonderbra\" brand, and a spike in push-up, plunge bras around the world.\n*Additional fashion trends of the 1990s include the [[Tamagotchi]], [[Inline skates|Rollerblades]], [[Pogs]] and [[Dr. Martens]] shoes.\n*Bleached Blond hair became very popular in the late '90s, as was men with short hair with the bangs \"flipped up\".\n*The 1990s also saw the return of '70s teen female fashion with long, straight hair and denim hot pants.\n*''[[Beverly Hills 90210]]'' sideburns also became popular in the early and mid-1990s.\n*[[Slap bracelet]]s were a popular fad among children, pre-teens and teenagers in the early 1990s and were available in a wide variety of patterns and colors.

''[[Tomb Raider]]''{{'}}s (PlayStation) [[Lara Croft]] became a video game sex symbol, becoming a recognizable figure in the entertainment industry throughout the late 1990s.\n\n[[3D computer graphics|3-D]] graphics become the standard by end of decade. Although [[First-person shooter|FPSs]] had long since seen the transition to full 3D, other genres begin to copy this trend by the end of the decade. Most notable first shooter games in the 1990s are ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]'' and ''[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six (video game)|Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six]]''.\n\nThe [[console wars]], primarily between [[Sega]] (Mega Drive, marketed as the [[Sega Genesis]] in North America, introduced in 1988) and [[Nintendo]] ([[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], introduced in 1990), sees the entrance of [[Sony]] with the [[PlayStation]] in 1994, which becomes the first successful CD-based console (as opposed to [[ROM cartridge|cartridges]]).

Hundreds of knock-offs are widely popular in the mid-to-late 1990s. ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' (1993) bursts onto the world scene, and instantly popularizes the [[First-person shooter|FPS]] genre. ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' (1998) features the next evolutionary step in the genre with continual progression of the game (no levels in the traditional sense) and an entirely in-person view, and becomes one of the most popular computer games in history.\n\nThe [[real-time strategy]] (RTS) genre is introduced in 1992 with the release of ''[[Dune II]]''. ''[[Warcraft: Orcs & Humans]]'' (1994) popularizes the genre, with ''[[Command & Conquer]]'' and ''[[Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness]]'' in 1995, setting up the first major real-time strategy competition and popularizing multiplayer capabilities in RTS games. ''[[StarCraft]]'' in 1998 becomes the second best-selling computer game of all time. It remains among the most popular multiplayer RTS games to this day, especially in [[South Korea]]. ''[[Homeworld]]'' in 1999 becomes the first successful 3d RTS game. The rise of the RTS genre is often credited with the fall of the [[turn-based strategy]] (TBS) genre, popularized with ''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]'' in 1991. ''[[Final Fantasy (video game)|Final Fantasy]]'' debuted (in North America) in 1990 for the NES, and remains among the most popular video game [[Final Fantasy|franchises]], with many new titles to date and more in development, plus numerous spin-offs, sequels, films and related titles. ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', released in 1997, especially popularized the series.\n\n[[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s (MMORPGs) see their entrance into the computer game world with ''[[Ultima Online]]'' in 1997, although they don't gain widespread popularity until ''[[EverQuest]]'' and ''[[Asheron's Call]]'' in 1999.

The series would go all seven games won by the home teams that concluded in dramatic fashion with the Minnesota Twins claiming their second World Series title.\n*American NBA basketball player [[Michael Jordan]] became a major sports and pop culture icon idolized by millions worldwide. He revolutionized sports marketing through deals with companies such as [[Gatorade]], [[Hanes]], [[McDonald's]] and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]. His Chicago Bulls team won six NBA titles during the decade ([[1991 NBA Finals|1991]], [[1992 NBA Finals|1992]], [[1993 NBA Finals|1993]], [[1996 NBA Finals|1996]], [[1997 NBA Finals|1997]] and [[1998 NBA Finals|1998]]). He was loved outside basketball thanks to his self-portrayal in the film ''[[Space Jam]]'' with the ''[[Looney Tunes|Looney Tune]]'' characters.\n*The [[National Hockey League]] would expand from 21 to 30 teams. During the expansion years, several teams would relocate to new cities: the [[Winnipeg Jets (1972-96)|Winnipeg Jets]] moved to [[Phoenix, Arizona]] and became the [[Phoenix Coyotes]], the [[Quebec Nordiques]] moved to [[Denver]] and became the [[Colorado Avalanche]], the [[Hartford Whalers]] moved to [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] and became the [[Carolina Hurricanes]], and the [[Minnesota North Stars]] moved to [[Dallas]] and became the [[Dallas Stars]].\n*The NHL's 1990s expansion saw new teams in cities that previously never had NHL hockey: [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] ([[San Jose Sharks]]), [[Anaheim]] ([[Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]]), [[Nashville]] ([[Nashville Predators]]), Miami ([[Florida Panthers]]), and [[Tampa]] ([[Tampa Bay Lightning]]). The NHL also returned to Atlanta with the expansion [[Atlanta Thrashers]].\n*Two of the NHL's [[Original Six]] teams, the [[New York Rangers]] and the [[Detroit Red Wings]] would end long [[Stanley Cup]] championship droughts; the Rangers in [[1994 Stanley Cup Finals|1994]] after [[Curse of 1940|54 years]], and the Red Wings would win back to back Cups in [[1997 Stanley Cup Finals|1997]] and [[1998 Stanley Cup Finals|1998]] after [[1955 Stanley Cup Finals|42 years]].\n*Canadian hockey star [[Mario Lemieux]] led the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], one of the original NHL expansion teams, to back-to-back Stanley Cup championships in [[1991 Stanley Cup Finals|1991]] and [[1992 Stanley Cup Finals|1992]].\n*In addition to the Pittsburgh Penguins, three other NHL expansion teams went on to earn their first Stanley Cup championships: the [[New Jersey Devils]] in [[1995 Stanley Cup Finals|1995]], the Colorado Avalanche in [[1996 Stanley Cup Finals|1996]], and the Dallas Stars in [[1999 Stanley Cup Finals|1999]].\n*Canadian hockey star [[Wayne Gretzky]] announced his retirement from the NHL in 1999. Upon his final game on 18 April, he held forty regular-season records, fifteen playoff records, and six All-Star records. He is the leading point-scorer in NHL history, as well as the only NHL player to total over 200 points in one season \u2013 a feat he accomplished four times. In addition, he tallied over 100 points in 16 professional seasons, 14 of them consecutive. He played for four teams during his NHL career: the [[Edmonton Oilers]], the [[Los Angeles Kings]], the [[St. Louis Blues]], and the New York Rangers.\n*American cyclist [[Lance Armstrong]] won his first [[Tour de France]] in 1999, less than two years after battling [[testicular cancer]].\n*In [[professional wrestling]], the [[1980s professional wrestling boom|boom period]] of the [[WWE|WWF]] from the late 1980s continued until 1993, led by such stars as [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[The Ultimate Warrior]]. A second boom period of the decade was introduced during the [[Monday Night Wars]] between the WWF and [[WCW]] from the middle of the decade to spawn the WWF's [[Attitude Era]], home to some of the biggest names in Wrestling history such as [[The Undertaker]], who would go on to have an [[The Streak (wrestling)|undefeated streak at WrestleMania]] that would go on until [[WrestleMania XXX]] in April 2014, [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] and the highly popular [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] group, along with [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] and [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] who brought WCW major success.\n*[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] won an unprecedented [[treble (association football)|treble]] of the [[Premier League]], [[FA Cup]] and [[1999 UEFA Champions League Final|Champions League]] after defeating [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] 2\u20131 in May 1999.\n*The United States hosted the 15th staging of the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] in 1994. To this day, it holds the record for largest attendance per game during the World Cup finals (even after the tournament's expansion to 32 teams and 64 matches). Additionally, this led to the creation of the [[Major League Soccer|MLS]].\n*In motor racing, triple [[Formula One]] World Champion [[Ayrton Senna]] is fatally injured in a crash at [[1994 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino]] in 1994. [[Michael Schumacher]] enters into the sport \u2013 winning his first two championships in [[1994 Formula One season|1994]] and [[1995 Formula One season|1995]].

About 1% of all known asteroids in the asteroid belt belong to this family.\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Hygiea family.png|left|thumb|400px|Location and structure of the Hygiea family.]]\nBy far the largest member is [[10 Hygiea]], a 400&nbsp;km diameter [[C-type asteroid]] that is the fourth largest in the belt. The remaining members are much smaller so Hygiea contains about 94\u201398% of the mass in the family (depending on the exact criteria for inclusion). The two next largest members are [[333 Badenia]], and [[538 Friederike]], both just over 70&nbsp;km in diameter. After that, the remaining members have diameters of less than 30&nbsp;km.\n\nThe Hygiea family is thought to be of the ''cratering'' type, implying that it was formed as a result of a giant impact that excavated the much smaller family members from Hygiea (Zappala 1995, Farinella 1996). However, the two 70-kilometer-diameter bodies are still surprisingly large to have been excavated in an impact that did not disrupt the parent body (compare e.g. to the [[Vesta family]], which contains no members above around 10&nbsp;km in diameter). They may be interlopers (see below) despite having a similar spectral type to Hygiea, because dark carbonaceous asteroids dominate the outer asteroid belt.\n\nThe family contains a significant number of objects of the otherwise rare [[B-type asteroid|B spectral type]] (Moth\u00e9-Diniz 2001).

The following have been identified in a spectral survey (Moth\u00e9-Diniz 2001), and also by inspection of the [https://archive.today/20031119173516/http://www.psi.edu/pds/archive/tax.html PDS asteroid taxonomy data set] for\n[[S-type asteroid|S-]] and [[D-type asteroid|D-type]] members: [[100 Hekate]], [[108 Hecuba]], [[1109 Tata]], [[1209 Pumma]], and [[1599 Giomus]].\n\nIn fact, some of the other asteroids of the C spectral type are probably interlopers as well, due to the prevalence of this spectral type in the region. Possible candidates include [[333 Badenia]] and [[538 Friederike]], based on their unusually large size for cratering family members.\n\n[[52 Europa]], a very large 300&nbsp;km diameter asteroid orbits nearby with a proper inclination of 6.37\u00b0, and was sometimes considered part of the Hygiea family in the past, but it is an unrelated asteroid. A better sampling of asteroids in the area in recent years has clearly shown that it orbits well beyond the Hygiea family clump.\n\n==References==\n* [[Vincenzo Zappal\u00e0|Zappal\u00e0, Vincenzo]]; Bendjoya, Philippe; Cellino, Alberto; [[Paolo Farinella|Farinella, Paolo]] and Froeschl\u00e9, Claude; ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20070716032313/http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WGF-45NJHPF-3C&_coverDate=08%2F31%2F1995&_alid=267428521&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_qd=1&_cdi=6821&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000056973&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=2337731&md5=6a0ee5be29f8c0489e922cb06868ae45 Asteroid Families: Search of a 12,487-Asteroid Sample Using Two Different Clustering Techniques]'', Icarus, Volume 116, Issue 2 (August 1995), pages 291\u2013314\n* Farinella, Paolo; Davia, D.

They were a Protestant family in a heavily Roman Catholic town.{{sfn|Alexiou|2006|p=9}} Her brother, [[John Decker Butzner, Jr.]], served as a judge on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]]. After graduation from [[Scranton School District (Pennsylvania)|Scranton High School]], she worked for a year as the unpaid assistant to the [[women's page]] editor at the ''[[Scranton Tribune]]''.\n\n=== New York City ===\nIn 1935, during the [[Great Depression]], she moved to New York City with her sister Betty.{{sfn|Alexiou|2006|pp=15\u201316}} Jane Butzner took an immediate liking to Manhattan's [[Greenwich Village]], which deviated some from the city's [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811|grid structure]]. The sisters soon moved there from Brooklyn.{{sfn|Alexiou|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Flint|2009|pp=3\u20135}}\n\nDuring her early years in the city, Jacobs held a variety of jobs working as a [[stenographer]] and [[freelance writer]], writing about working districts in the city. These experiences, she later said, \"gave me more of a notion of what was going on in the city and what business was like, what work was like.\" Her first job was for a trade magazine as a secretary, then an editor. She sold articles to the ''Sunday Herald Tribune'', ''Cue'' magazine, and ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''.{{sfn|Alexiou|2006|pp=22\u201323}}\n\nShe studied at [[Columbia University]]'s [[Columbia University School of General Studies|School of General Studies]] for two years, taking courses in geology, [[zoology]], law, [[political science]], and economics.{{sfn|Alexiou|2006|pp=23\u201324}} About the freedom to pursue study across her wide-ranging interests, she said:\n\n<blockquote>For the first time I liked school and for the first time I made good marks. This was almost my undoing because after I had garnered, statistically, a certain number of credits I became the property of [[Barnard College]] at Columbia, and once I was the property of Barnard I had to take, it seemed, what Barnard wanted me to take, not what I wanted to learn. Fortunately my high-school marks had been so bad that Barnard decided I could not belong to it and I was therefore allowed to continue getting an education.{{sfn|Allen|1997}}</blockquote>\n\n== Career ==\nAfter attending Columbia University's School of General Studies for two years, Butzner found a job at ''Iron Age'' magazine. Her 1943 article on economic decline in Scranton was well-publicized and led the [[Murray Corporation of America]] to locate a warplane factory there. Encouraged by this success, Butzner petitioned the [[War Production Board]] to support more operations in Scranton.{{sfn|Flint|2009|p=10}} Experiencing job discrimination at ''Iron Age'', she also advocated for [[equal pay for women]] and for the right of workers to unionize.{{sfn|Flint|2009|p=11}}\n\n=== ''Amerika'' ===\nShe became a feature writer for the [[Office of War Information]], and then a reporter for ''[[Amerika (magazine)|Amerika]]'', a publication of the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/708496|title=The Unknown Jane Jacobs|journal=Reconsidering Jane Jacobs|first=Peter L.|last=Laurence|editor-last1=Page|editor-first1=Max |editor-first2=Tim|editor-last2=Mennel |location=Chicago |publisher=APA Planners Press |isbn=978-1-932364-95-8 |access-date=5 May 2016}}</ref> While working there she met Robert Hyde Jacobs Jr., a Columbia-educated architect who was designing warplanes for [[Grumman]]. They married in 1944. Together they had a daughter, Burgin, and two sons, James and Ned. They bought a three-story building at 555 [[Hudson Street (Manhattan)|Hudson St]]. Jane continued to write for ''Amerika'' after the war, while Robert left Grumman and resumed work as an architect.{{sfn|Alexiou|2006|pp=25\u201327}}\n\nThe Jacobses rejected the rapidly growing [[suburbs]] as \"parasitic\", choosing to remain in Greenwich Village.{{sfn|Alexiou|2006|pp=29\u201330|ps=\"The suburbs did not appeal to the Jacobs family. 'Suburbs are perfectly valid places to want to live, but they are inherently parasitic, economically and socially, too, because they live off the answers found in cities,' Jacobs told a reporter for ''Madmoiselle'' magazine in October 1962.\"}} They renovated their house, in the middle of a mixed residential and commercial area, and created a garden in the backyard.{{sfn|Flint|2009|p=14}}\n\nWorking for the State Department during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy]] era, Jacobs received a questionnaire about her political beliefs and loyalties. Jacobs was anti-communist, and had left the [[Federal Workers Union]] because of its apparent communist sympathies. Nevertheless, she was pro-union and purportedly appreciated the writing of [[Saul Alinsky]]; therefore she was under suspicion.{{sfn|Alexiou|2006|pp= 30\u201331}}{{sfn|Flint|2009|p=16}} On 25 March 1952, Jacobs delivered her response to Conrad E.

In her foreword to her answer, she said:\n\n<blockquote>The other threat to the security of our tradition, I believe, lies at home. It is the current fear of radical ideas and of people who propound them. I do not agree with the extremists of either the left or the right, but I think they should be allowed to speak and to publish, both because they themselves have, and ought to have, rights, and once their rights are gone, the rights of the rest of us are hardly safe ...{{sfn|Allen|1997|p=170}}</blockquote>\n\n=== ''Architectural Forum'' ===\nJacobs left ''Amerika'' in 1952 when it announced its relocation to Washington, D.C.<ref name=\"academia.edu\">{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/708475|title=The Death and Life of Urban Design: Jane Jacobs, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the New Research in Urbanism, 1955\u20131965|date=June 2006|journal=Journal of Urban Design|first=Peter L.|last=Laurence|pages=145\u201372|volume=11|issue=2|doi=10.1080/13574800600644001}}</ref> She found a well-paying job at ''[[Architectural Forum]]'', published by [[Henry Luce]] of [[Time Inc.]]{{sfn|Alexiou|2006|p=33}} She was hired as an associate editor.

Although her editors expected a positive story, Jacobs criticized Bacon's project, reacting against its lack of concern for the poor African Americans who were directly affected.

Kirk came to the ''Architectural Forum'' offices to describe the impact that \"revitalization\" had on East Harlem, and he introduced Jacobs to the neighborhood.{{sfn|Alexiou|2006|pp=43\u201349}}\n\nIn 1956, Jacobs delivered a lecture at Harvard University, standing in for [[Douglas Haskell]] of ''Architectural Forum''.<ref name=\"academia.edu\" /> She addressed leading architects, urban planners, and intellectuals (including [[Lewis Mumford]]), speaking on the topic of East Harlem. She urged this audience to \"respect \u2013 in the deepest sense \u2013 strips of chaos that have a weird wisdom of their own not yet encompassed in our concept of urban order.\" Contrary to her expectations, the talk was received with enthusiasm, but it also marked her as a threat to established urban planners, real estate owners, and developers.{{sfn|Flint|2009|pp=24\u201326}}{{sfn|Alexiou|2006|pp=57\u201359}} ''Architectural Forum'' printed the speech that year, along with photographs of East Harlem.{{sfn|Alexiou|2006|p=60}}\n\n=== Rockefeller Foundation and ''Death and Life of Great American Cities'' ===\nAfter reading her Harvard speech, [[William H.

Lynch]]'s ''Image of the City''.<ref name=\"academia.edu\" /> In May 1958, Gilpatric invited Jacobs to begin serving as a reviewer for grant proposals.<ref name=\"academia.edu\" /> Later that year, the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] awarded a grant to Jacobs to produce a critical study of city planning and urban life in the U.S. (From the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s, the foundation's Humanities Division sponsored an \"Urban Design Studies\" research program, of which Jacobs was the best known grantee.)<ref name=\"academia.edu\" /> Gilpatric encouraged Jacobs to \"explor[e] the field of urban design to look for ideas and actions which may improve thinking on how the design of cities might better serve urban life, including cultural and humane value.\"<ref name=\"academia.edu\" /> Affiliating with [[The New School]] (then called The New School for Social Research), she spent three years conducting research and writing drafts.

This angered the male-dominated urban planning profession. Jacobs was criticized as a \"militant dame\" and a \"housewife\": an amateur who had no right to interfere with an established discipline. {{sfn|Alexiou|2006|pp=83\u201390}}One planner dismissed Jacobs' book as \"bitter coffee-house rambling.\"  Robert Moses, sent a copy, called it \"intemperate and also libelous. . .

Moses' plan, funded as \"slum clearance\" by Title I of the [[Housing Act of 1949]], also called for several blocks to be razed and replaced with upscale high-rises. The plan forced 132 families out of their homes and displaced 1,000 small businesses\u2014the result was [[Washington Square Village]].{{sfn|Alexiou|2006|pp=50\u201352}}[[File:Washington Square Park 02.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Jacobs fought to prevent [[Washington Square Park]], pictured, from being demolished for a highway]]\nAs part of his efforts to revitalize the area, Moses proposed the extension of Fifth Avenue through Washington Square Park in 1935. In the face of community opposition, Moses shelved the project, but revived the idea in the 1950s. Moses argued that the Fifth Avenue extension would improve the flow of traffic through the neighborhood and provide access to the planned [[Lower Manhattan Expressway]] (LOMEX), which would connect the [[Manhattan Bridge]] and [[Williamsburg Bridge]] with the [[Holland Tunnel]].{{sfn|Flint|2009|p=65}}\n\nIn response, local activist Shirley Hayes created the \"Committee to Save Washington Square Park\", a coalition of dozens of local neighborhood groups that opposed the roadway extension. [[Raymond Rubinow|Raymond S. Rubinow]] eventually took over the organization, changing its name to the \"Joint Emergency Committee to Close Washington Square to Traffic.\" Jacobs had joined the committee under Hayes, but took a more prominent role under Rubinow, reaching out to media outlets such as ''[[The Village Voice]]'', which provided more sympathetic coverage than ''[[The New York Times]]''.{{sfn|Flint|2009|pp=83\u201384}} The committee gained the support of [[Margaret Mead]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], [[Lewis Mumford]], [[Charles Abrams]], and [[William H. Whyte]], as well as [[Carmine De Sapio]], Greenwich Village resident and influential Democratic leader. De Sapio's involvement proved decisive.{{sfn|Flint|2009|p=86}} On 25 June 1958, the city closed Washington Square Park to traffic, and the joint committee held a ribbon tying (not cutting) ceremony.{{sfn|Flint|2009|p=85}}\n\nPlans for LOMEX expressway continued despite growing community opposition in areas such as Little Italy.

Jacobs was an advocate of a [[Proposal for the Province of Toronto|Province of Toronto]] to separate the city proper from [[Ontario]]. Jacobs said, \"Cities, to thrive in the twenty-first century, must separate themselves politically from their surrounding areas.\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} <!-- Note: the 16 March 2010 article \"Should Toronto go it alone?\" in the Toronto Star is not an acceptable source, as the author may have obtained the quotation from this WP article -->\n\nShe was selected to be an officer of the [[Order of Canada]] in 1996 for her seminal writings and thought-provoking commentaries on [[urban development]]. The community and urban sociology section of the [[American Sociological Association]] awarded her its Outstanding Lifetime Contribution award in 2002. In 1997, the city government of Toronto sponsored a conference entitled \"Jane Jacobs: Ideas That Matter\", which led to a book by the same name. At the end of the conference, the Jane Jacobs Prize was created. It includes an annual stipend of $5,000 for three years to be given to \"celebrate Toronto's original, unsung heroes \u2013 by seeking out citizens who are engaged in activities that contribute to the city's vitality\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ideasthatmatter.com/people/jj-prize.html|title=The Jane Jacobs Prize|publisher=Ideas that Matter|accessdate=6 May 2006}}</ref>{{sfn|Alexiou|2006}}\n\n[[File:Jane Jacobs and SBB.jpg|thumb|left|Jacobs with [[Ecotrust]] foreman Spencer Beebe in [[Portland, Oregon]], 2004]]\nJacobs never shied away from expressing her political support for specific candidates. She opposed the 1997 amalgamation of the cities of [[Metro Toronto]], fearing that individual neighborhoods would have less power with the new structure. She backed an ecologist, [[Tooker Gomberg]], who lost Toronto's 2000 mayoralty race, and was an adviser to [[David Miller (Canadian politician)|David Miller's]] successful mayoral campaign in 2003, at a time when he was seen as a [[wikt:longshot|longshot]].

The tunnel opened on 30 July 2015.\n\nJacobs also was active in a campaign against a plan of [[Royal St. George's College]] (an established school very close to Jacobs' residence in Toronto's Annex district) to reconfigure its facilities.

This is something that has puzzled people always. I think I've figured out what it is.\n\nExpansion and development are two different things. Development is differentiation of what already existed. Practically every new thing that happens is a differentiation of a previous thing, from a new shoe sole to changes in legal codes. Expansion is an actual growth in size or volume of activity. That is a different thing.\n\nI've gone at it two different ways. Way back when I wrote ''The Economy of Cities'', I wrote about import replacing and how that expands, not just the economy of the place where it occurs, but economic life altogether. As a city replaces imports, it shifts its imports. It doesn't import less. And yet it has everything it had before.\n\n'''''Reason''''': It's not a zero-sum game. It's a bigger, growing pie.\n\n'''Jacobs''': That's the actual mechanism of it. The theory of it is what I explain in ''The Nature of Economies''. I equate it to what happens with biomass, the sum total of all flora and fauna in an area. The energy, the material that's involved in this, doesn't just escape the community as an export. It continues being used in a community, just as in a rainforest the waste from certain organisms and various plants and animals gets used by other ones in the place.|author=Jane Jacobs|source=\"City Views: Urban studies legend Jane Jacobs on gentrification, the New Urbanism, and her legacy\", ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'', June 2001, Interviewer: Bill Steigerwald}}\n\nWhile Jacobs saw her greatest legacy to be her contributions to economic theory, it is in the realm of urban planning that she has had her most extensive impact.

The concept had a huge influence on planners and architects such as Oscar Newman, who prepared the idea through a series of studies that would culminate in his [[defensible space theory]]. Jacobs's and Newman's work would go on to affect American housing policy through the [[HOPE VI]] Program, an effort by the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] to demolish the high-rise public housing projects so reviled by Jacobs, and to replace them with low-rise, [[mixed-income housing]].\n\nThroughout her life, she fought to alter the way in which city development was approached. By arguing that cities were living beings and ecosystems, she advocated ideas such as \"mixed use\" development and bottom-up planning.

Her family's conversion of an old candy shop into a home is an example of the gentrifying trend that would continue under the influence of Jacobs's ideas.<ref name=Klemek_2011 /><ref name=Glaeser_2010-05-04 />\n\nGentrification also was caused, however, by \"the completely unexpected influx of affluent residents back into the inner city\".<ref name=Klemek_2011 /> The extent to which her ideas facilitated this phenomenon was at the time unimaginable. For example, she advocated the preservation of older buildings specifically because their lack of economic value made them affordable for poor people. In this respect, she saw them as \"guarantors of social diversity\".<ref name=Klemek_2011 /> That many of these older structures have increased in economic value solely due to their age was implausible in 1961. Issues of gentrification have dominated criticism of Jane Jacobs' planning ideas.<ref name=Ouroussoff_2006-04-30 />\n\nHer concepts have also been criticized more broadly. Economist [[Tyler Cowen]] has criticized her ideas for not addressing problems of scale or infrastructure, and suggests that economists disagree with some of her approaches to development.<ref name=W /> For example, although her ideas of planning were praised at times as \"universal\",<ref name=\"Lang, G 2009\" /> they are now thought inapplicable when a city grows from one million to ten million (as has happened many times in developing nations). Such arguments suggest that the ideas apply only to cities with similar issues to those of New York, where Jacobs developed many of her ideas.\n\n== Works ==\nJane Jacobs spent her life studying cities. Her books include:\n\n=== ''The Death and Life of Great American Cities'' ===\n{{Main|The Death and Life of Great American Cities}}\n''The Death and Life of Great American Cities'' is her single-most influential book and possibly the most influential book on urban planning and cities. Published in 1961, this book was widely read by both planning professionals and the general public; the book is a strong critique of the urban renewal policies of the 1950s, which, she claimed, destroyed communities and created isolated, unnatural urban spaces. In the book she celebrates the diversity and complexity of old-mixed use neighborhoods, while lamenting the monotony and sterility of modern planning.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=9780415252256|pages=405}}</ref> Jacobs advocated the abolition of zoning laws and restoration of free markets in land, which would result in dense, mixed-use neighborhoods and frequently cited New York City's [[Greenwich Village]] as an example of a vibrant urban community.\n\n[[Robert Caro]] has cited it as the strongest influence on ''[[The Power Broker]]'', his [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]]-winning biography of Robert Moses, though Caro does not mention Jacobs by name even once in the book despite Jacobs' battles with Moses over his proposed [[Lower Manhattan Expressway]]. Caro reportedly cut a chapter about Jacobs due to his book's length.<ref>{{cite web|last=Oder|first=Norman|title=The Missing Jane Jacobs Chapter in The Power Broker|url=http://atlanticyardsreport.blogspot.com/2007/10/missing-jane-jacobs-chapter-in-power.html|website=atlanticyardsreport.blogspot.com|accessdate=9 October 2007}}</ref>\n\nBeyond the practical lessons in city design and planning that ''Death and Life'' offers, the theoretical underpinnings of the work challenge the modern development mindset. Jane Jacobs defends her positions with common sense and anecdotes.\n\n=== ''The Economy of Cities'' ===\nThe thesis of this book is that cities are the primary drivers of economic development. Her main argument is that explosive economic growth derives from urban [[import replacement]]. Import replacement is the process of producing goods locally which were formerly imported, e.g., Tokyo bicycle factories replacing Tokyo bicycle importers in the 1800s. Jacobs claims that import replacement builds up local infrastructure, skills, and production. Jacobs also claims that the increased production is subsequently exported to other cities, giving those other cities a new opportunity to engage in import replacement, thus producing a positive cycle of growth.\n\nIn an interview with Bill Steigerwald in ''[[Reason Magazine]]'', Jacobs said that if she is remembered for being a great intellectual she will be remembered not for her work concerning city planning, but for the discovery of [[import replacement]]. Critics erroneously claim that her ideas parrot the idea of [[import substitution industrialization|import substitution]] advanced earlier by scholars such as [[Andre Gunder Frank]]. Import substitution was a national economic theory implying that if a nation substituted its imports with national production the nation would become wealthier, whereas Jacob's idea is entirely about cities and could be called urban import substitution. However, even this would lead to confusion since in practice, import substitution in India and Latin America were government subsidized and mandated, whereas Jacobs' concept of import replacement is a free market process of discovery and division of labor within a city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/archives/2001/06/01/city-views|title=City Views|work=Reason|date=June 2001}}</ref>\n\nIn the second part of the book, Jacobs argues that cities preceded agriculture. She argues that in cities trade in wild animals and grains allowed for the initial division of labor necessary for the discovery of husbandry and agriculture; these discoveries then moved out of the city due to land competition. Another interpretation of history, generally and erroneously considered to be contradictory to Jacobs' is supported by Marxist archaeologist [[Vere Gordon Childe]] and in recent times by another historical materialist [[Charles Keith Maisels]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Maisels|first=Charles Keith|date=1990|title=The Emergence of Civilisation: From Hunting and Gathering to Agriculture, Cities, and the State in the Near East|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}</ref>{{sfn|Soja|2000|p=24}} These writers argue that agriculture preceded cities. The apparent opposition between Childe and Jacobs theories rests in their definition of 'city,' 'civilization,' or 'urban.' Childe, like other materialists such as Maisels or [[Henri Lefebvre]] defines 'urban' or 'civilization' as [[Synoecism]]\u2014as a literate, socially stratified, monolithic political community,{{sfn|Soja|2000|p=25}} whereas, as one can see from ''The Economy of Cities'' or from ''Cities and the Wealth of Nations'', Jacobs defines the city purely along the lines of geographically dense trade giving way to entrepreneurial discovery and subsequent improvements in the division of labor. Without the requirements of literacy, monumental building, or the signs of specialized civil and armed forces, 'cities' can be accurately be interpreted to exists thousands of years before when Childe and Maisels place them. However, Jacobs' definition is supposition, since 'city' is defined simply as a large town or \"a large human settlement\" indicating permanence. The earliest remains of mankind uncovered by archaeologists do not give us more information other than they were hunter-gatherers as there is no evidence yet of farming or settlement, implying nomadic lifestyles until further discoveries are found.<ref>{{cite web|website=bradshawfoundation.com|title=Discovery of Earliest Homo Sapien Skulls backs 'Out of Africa' Theory|first=Clive|last=Cookson|url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/herto_skulls.php}}</ref>\n\n=== ''The Question of Separatism: Quebec and the Struggle over Sovereignty'' ===\n\n''The Question of Separatism'' incorporated and expanded Jacobs' presentation of the 1979 [[Massey Lectures]], entitled ''Canadian Cities and Sovereignty-Association''. It was published in 1980 and reprinted in 2011 with a previously-unpublished 2005 interview with [[Robin Philpot]] on the subject in which she evokes the relative overlooking of that book among her usual readership. This was in fact the first time she was requested to discuss it in an interview. Columnist [[Richard Gwyn]] advanced that while not openly criticizing her, English-speaking Canadians readers thought she did not understood how Canadian politics worked and that she was not being helpful in a time of distress for national unity (the [[1980 Quebec referendum|1980 referendum]] was just defeated by a vote of 60%). ''The Question of Separatism'' was also not mentioned in the bibliography of her 2006 obituary in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Philpot |first=Robin |page=X |chapter=Preface to the 2011 edition |title=Jane Jacobs, The Question of Separatism: Quebec and the Struggle over Sovereignty|trans-title= |publisher=Baraka Books |year=2011|subscription= }}</ref>\n\nJacobs' book advances the view that [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec's eventual independence]] is best for [[Montreal]], Toronto, the rest of Canada, and the world; and that such independence can be achieved peacefully. As precedent, she cites [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden|Norway's secession from Sweden]] and how it enriched both nations. The origins of the contemporary secessionist-movement in the [[Quiet Revolution]] are examined, along with Canada's historical reliance on [[natural resources]] and foreign-owned manufacturing for its own [[economic development]]. Jacobs asserts that such an approach is colonial and hence backward, citing by example Canada buying its [[skis]] and furniture from Norway or Norwegian-owned factories in Canada, the latter procedure being a product of Canadian [[tariff]]s designed specifically to foster such factories. The relevant public views of [[Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque]], [[Claude Ryan]], and then Prime Minister [[Pierre Elliott Trudeau|Pierre Trudeau]] are also critically analyzed, an example being their failure to recognize that two respective, independent [[Currency|currencies]] are essential to the success of an independent Quebec and a smaller resultant Canada, an issue that is central to her book. Jacobs stresses the need for Montreal to continue developing its leadership of [[Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (word)|Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] culture, but that such a need can ultimately never be fulfilled by Montreal's increasing tendencies toward [[regional]]-city status, tendencies foretelling economic, political, and cultural subservience to English-speaking Toronto. Such an outcome, Jacobs believed, would in the long run doom Quebec's independence as much as it would hinder Canada's own future. She concludes with her observation that the popular equating of political secession with political and economic failure is the result of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], which perceived [[nature]] as a force for \"standardization, uniformity, universality, and immutability.\" Since then, naturalists and their readers have gradually realized that nature is a force for diversity, and that, \"diversity itself is of the essence of excellence.\" The right kind of secession, Jacobs states, can lead to the right kind of diversity, and Quebec and Canada are capable of both, and must achieve both, to survive.\n\n=== ''Cities and the Wealth of Nations'' ===\n''[[Cities and the Wealth of Nations]]'' attempts to do for economics what ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]'' did for modern urban planning, though it has not received the same critical attention. Beginning with a concise treatment of classical economics, this book challenges one of the fundamental assumptions of the greatest economists. Classical (and Neo-classical) economists consider the nation-state to be the main player in [[macroeconomics]]. Jacobs argues that it is not the nation-state, rather it is the city which is the true player in this worldwide game. She restates the idea of import replacement from her earlier book ''[[The Economy of Cities]]'', while speculating on the further ramifications of considering the city first and the nation second, or not at all.\n\n=== ''Systems of Survival'' ===\n{{Main|Systems of Survival}}\n\n''Systems of Survival: A Dialogue on the Moral Foundations of Commerce and Politics'' moves outside of the city, studying the moral underpinnings of [[labour (economics)|work]]. As with her other work, she used an observational approach. This book is written as a [[Plato]]nic dialogue. It appears that she (as described by characters in her book) took newspaper clippings of moral judgments related to work, collected and sorted them to find that they fit two patterns of moral behavior that were mutually exclusive. She calls these two patterns \"Moral Syndrome A\", or commercial moral syndrome, and \"Moral Syndrome B\", or guardian moral syndrome. She claims that the commercial moral syndrome is applicable to business owners, scientists, farmers, and traders. Similarly, she claims that the guardian moral syndrome is applicable to government, charities, hunter-gatherers, and religious institutions. She also claims that these Moral Syndromes are fixed, and do not fluctuate over time.\n\nIt is important to stress that Jane Jacobs is providing a theory about the morality of work, and not all moral ideas. Moral ideas that are not included in her system are applicable to both syndromes.\n\nJane Jacobs goes on to describe what happens when these two moral syndromes are mixed, showing the work underpinnings of the [[American Mafia|Mafia]] and communism, and what happens when [[New York City Subway|New York subway]] Police are paid bonuses here \u2013 reinterpreted slightly as a part of the larger analysis.\n\n=== ''The Nature of Economies'' ===\n''The Nature of Economies'', a dialog between friends concerning the premise: \"human beings exist wholly within nature as part of the natural order in every respect\" (p. ''ix''), argues that the same principles underlie both [[ecosystem]]s and [[economic system|economies]]: \"development and co-development through differentiation and their combinations; expansion through diverse, multiple uses of energy; and self-maintenance through self-refueling\" (p.&nbsp;82). Jacobs also comments on the nature of economic and biological diversity and its role in the development and growth of the two kinds of systems.\n\nJacobs' characters discuss the four methods by which \"dynamically stable systems\" may evade collapse: \"bifurcations; [[positive feedback|positive-feedback loops]]; [[negative feedback|negative-feedback controls]]; and emergency adaptations\" (p.&nbsp;86). Their conversations also cover the \"double nature of fitness for survival\" (traits to avoid destroying one's own habitat as well as success in competition to feed and breed, p.&nbsp;119), and unpredictability including the [[butterfly effect]] characterized in terms of multiplicity of variables as well as disproportional response to cause, and [[self-organization]] where \"a system can be making itself up as it goes along\" (p.&nbsp;137).\n\nThe book is infused with many real-world economic and biological examples, which help keep the book \"down to earth\" and comprehensible, if dense. Concepts are furnished with both economic and biological examples, showing their coherence in both worlds.\n\nOne particularly interesting insight is the creation of \"something from nothing\" \u2013 an economy from nowhere. In the biological world, free energy is given through sunlight, but in the economic world human creativity and natural resources supply this free energy, or at least starter energy. Another interesting insight is the creation of economic diversity through the combination of different technologies, for example the typewriter and television as inputs and outputs of a computer system: this can lead to the creation of \"new species of work\".\n\n=== ''Dark Age Ahead'' ===\n{{Main|Dark Age Ahead}}\n\nPublished in 2004 by Random House, ''Dark Age Ahead'' posits Jacobs' argument that \"North American\" civilization shows signs of a spiral decline comparable to the collapse of the Roman empire. Her discussion focuses on \"five pillars of our culture that we depend on to stand firm,\" which can be summarized as the nuclear family and community; quality in education; free thought in science; representational government and responsible taxes; and corporate and professional accountability. As the book's title suggests, Jacobs' outlook is far more pessimistic than that of her previous works. However, in the conclusion she admits: \"At a given time it is hard to tell whether forces of cultural life or death are in the ascendancy. Is suburban sprawl, with its murders of communities and wastes of land, time, and energy, a sign of decay? Or is rising interest in means of overcoming sprawl a sign of vigor and adaptability in North American culture?

They were a Protestant family in a heavily Roman Catholic town.{{sfn|Alexiou|2006|p=9}} Her brother, [[John Decker Butzner, Jr.]], served as a judge on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]]. After graduation from [[Scranton School District (Pennsylvania)|Scranton High School]], she worked for a year as the unpaid assistant to the [[women's page]] editor at the ''[[Scranton Tribune]]''.\n\n=== New York City ===\nIn 1935, during the [[Great Depression]], she moved to New York City with her sister Betty.{{sfn|Alexiou|2006|pp=15\u201316}} Jane Butzner took an immediate liking to Manhattan's [[Greenwich Village]], which deviated some from the city's [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811|grid structure]]. The sisters soon moved there from Brooklyn.{{sfn|Alexiou|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Flint|2009|pp=3\u20135}}\n\nDuring her early years in the city, Jacobs held a variety of jobs working as a [[stenographer]] and [[freelance writer]], writing about working districts in the city. These experiences, she later said, \"gave me more of a notion of what was going on in the city and what business was like, what work was like.\" Her first job was for a trade magazine as a secretary, then an editor. She sold articles to the ''Sunday Herald Tribune'', ''Cue'' magazine, and ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''.{{sfn|Alexiou|2006|pp=22\u201323}}\n\nShe studied at [[Columbia University]]'s [[Columbia University School of General Studies|School of General Studies]] for two years, taking courses in geology, [[zoology]], law, [[political science]], and economics.{{sfn|Alexiou|2006|pp=23\u201324}} About the freedom to pursue study across her wide-ranging interests, she said:\n\n<blockquote>For the first time I liked school and for the first time I made good marks. This was almost my undoing because after I had garnered, statistically, a certain number of credits I became the property of [[Barnard College]] at Columbia, and once I was the property of Barnard I had to take, it seemed, what Barnard wanted me to take, not what I wanted to learn. Fortunately my high-school marks had been so bad that Barnard decided I could not belong to it and I was therefore allowed to continue getting an education.{{sfn|Allen|1997}}</blockquote>\n\n== Career ==\nAfter attending Columbia University's School of General Studies for two years, Butzner found a job at ''Iron Age'' magazine. Her 1943 article on economic decline in Scranton was well-publicized and led the [[Murray Corporation of America]] to locate a warplane factory there. Encouraged by this success, Butzner petitioned the [[War Production Board]] to support more operations in Scranton.{{sfn|Flint|2009|p=10}} Experiencing job discrimination at ''Iron Age'', she also advocated for [[equal pay for women]] and for the right of workers to unionize.{{sfn|Flint|2009|p=11}}\n\n=== ''Amerika'' ===\nShe became a feature writer for the [[Office of War Information]], and then a reporter for ''[[Amerika (magazine)|Amerika]]'', a publication of the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/708496|title=The Unknown Jane Jacobs|journal=Reconsidering Jane Jacobs|first=Peter L.|last=Laurence|editor-last1=Page|editor-first1=Max |editor-first2=Tim|editor-last2=Mennel |location=Chicago |publisher=APA Planners Press |isbn=978-1-932364-95-8 |access-date=5 May 2016}}</ref> While working there she met Robert Hyde Jacobs Jr., a Columbia-educated architect who was designing warplanes for [[Grumman]]. They married in 1944. Together they had a daughter, Burgin, and two sons, James and Ned. They bought a three-story building at 555 [[Hudson Street (Manhattan)|Hudson St]]. Jane continued to write for ''Amerika'' after the war, while Robert left Grumman and resumed work as an architect.{{sfn|Alexiou|2006|pp=25\u201327}}\n\nThe Jacobses rejected the rapidly growing [[suburbs]] as \"parasitic\", choosing to remain in Greenwich Village.{{sfn|Alexiou|2006|pp=29\u201330|ps=\"The suburbs did not appeal to the Jacobs family. 'Suburbs are perfectly valid places to want to live, but they are inherently parasitic, economically and socially, too, because they live off the answers found in cities,' Jacobs told a reporter for ''Madmoiselle'' magazine in October 1962.\"}} They renovated their house, in the middle of a mixed residential and commercial area, and created a garden in the backyard.{{sfn|Flint|2009|p=14}}\n\nWorking for the State Department during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy]] era, Jacobs received a questionnaire about her political beliefs and loyalties. Jacobs was anti-communist, and had left the [[Federal Workers Union]] because of its apparent communist sympathies. Nevertheless, she was pro-union and purportedly appreciated the writing of [[Saul Alinsky]]; therefore she was under suspicion.{{sfn|Alexiou|2006|pp= 30\u201331}}{{sfn|Flint|2009|p=16}} On 25 March 1952, Jacobs delivered her response to Conrad E. Snow, chairman of the Loyalty Security Board at the [[United States Department of State]]. In her foreword to her answer, she said:\n\n<blockquote>The other threat to the security of our tradition, I believe, lies at home. It is the current fear of radical ideas and of people who propound them. I do not agree with the extremists of either the left or the right, but I think they should be allowed to speak and to publish, both because they themselves have, and ought to have, rights, and once their rights are gone, the rights of the rest of us are hardly safe ...{{sfn|Allen|1997|p=170}}</blockquote>\n\n=== ''Architectural Forum'' ===\nJacobs left ''Amerika'' in 1952 when it announced its relocation to Washington, D.C.<ref name=\"academia.edu\">{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/708475|title=The Death and Life of Urban Design: Jane Jacobs, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the New Research in Urbanism, 1955\u20131965|date=June 2006|journal=Journal of Urban Design|first=Peter L.|last=Laurence|pages=145\u201372|volume=11|issue=2|doi=10.1080/13574800600644001}}</ref> She found a well-paying job at ''[[Architectural Forum]]'', published by [[Henry Luce]] of [[Time Inc.]]{{sfn|Alexiou|2006|p=33}} She was hired as an associate editor.

Although her editors expected a positive story, Jacobs criticized Bacon's project, reacting against its lack of concern for the poor African Americans who were directly affected.

All the hyped new projects that planners and architects were building in the cities, she told them, bore no relation to what people actually needed.\"}}\n\nIn 1955, Jacobs met William Kirk, an Episcopal minister who worked in [[East Harlem]]. Kirk came to the ''Architectural Forum'' offices to describe the impact that \"revitalization\" had on East Harlem, and he introduced Jacobs to the neighborhood.{{sfn|Alexiou|2006|pp=43\u201349}}\n\nIn 1956, Jacobs delivered a lecture at Harvard University, standing in for [[Douglas Haskell]] of ''Architectural Forum''.<ref name=\"academia.edu\" /> She addressed leading architects, urban planners, and intellectuals (including [[Lewis Mumford]]), speaking on the topic of East Harlem. She urged this audience to \"respect \u2013 in the deepest sense \u2013 strips of chaos that have a weird wisdom of their own not yet encompassed in our concept of urban order.\" Contrary to her expectations, the talk was received with enthusiasm, but it also marked her as a threat to established urban planners, real estate owners, and developers.{{sfn|Flint|2009|pp=24\u201326}}{{sfn|Alexiou|2006|pp=57\u201359}} ''Architectural Forum'' printed the speech that year, along with photographs of East Harlem.{{sfn|Alexiou|2006|p=60}}\n\n=== Rockefeller Foundation and ''Death and Life of Great American Cities'' ===\nAfter reading her Harvard speech, [[William H.

Moses' plan, funded as \"slum clearance\" by Title I of the [[Housing Act of 1949]], also called for several blocks to be razed and replaced with upscale high-rises.

In the face of community opposition, Moses shelved the project, but revived the idea in the 1950s. Moses argued that the Fifth Avenue extension would improve the flow of traffic through the neighborhood and provide access to the planned [[Lower Manhattan Expressway]] (LOMEX), which would connect the [[Manhattan Bridge]] and [[Williamsburg Bridge]] with the [[Holland Tunnel]].{{sfn|Flint|2009|p=65}}\n\nIn response, local activist Shirley Hayes created the \"Committee to Save Washington Square Park\", a coalition of dozens of local neighborhood groups that opposed the roadway extension.

This is something that has puzzled people always. I think I've figured out what it is.\n\nExpansion and development are two different things. Development is differentiation of what already existed. Practically every new thing that happens is a differentiation of a previous thing, from a new shoe sole to changes in legal codes. Expansion is an actual growth in size or volume of activity. That is a different thing.\n\nI've gone at it two different ways. Way back when I wrote ''The Economy of Cities'', I wrote about import replacing and how that expands, not just the economy of the place where it occurs, but economic life altogether. As a city replaces imports, it shifts its imports. It doesn't import less. And yet it has everything it had before.\n\n'''''Reason''''': It's not a zero-sum game. It's a bigger, growing pie.\n\n'''Jacobs''': That's the actual mechanism of it. The theory of it is what I explain in ''The Nature of Economies''. I equate it to what happens with biomass, the sum total of all flora and fauna in an area. The energy, the material that's involved in this, doesn't just escape the community as an export.

Her family's conversion of an old candy shop into a home is an example of the gentrifying trend that would continue under the influence of Jacobs's ideas.<ref name=Klemek_2011 /><ref name=Glaeser_2010-05-04 />\n\nGentrification also was caused, however, by \"the completely unexpected influx of affluent residents back into the inner city\".<ref name=Klemek_2011 /> The extent to which her ideas facilitated this phenomenon was at the time unimaginable. For example, she advocated the preservation of older buildings specifically because their lack of economic value made them affordable for poor people. In this respect, she saw them as \"guarantors of social diversity\".<ref name=Klemek_2011 /> That many of these older structures have increased in economic value solely due to their age was implausible in 1961. Issues of gentrification have dominated criticism of Jane Jacobs' planning ideas.<ref name=Ouroussoff_2006-04-30 />\n\nHer concepts have also been criticized more broadly. Economist [[Tyler Cowen]] has criticized her ideas for not addressing problems of scale or infrastructure, and suggests that economists disagree with some of her approaches to development.<ref name=W /> For example, although her ideas of planning were praised at times as \"universal\",<ref name=\"Lang, G 2009\" /> they are now thought inapplicable when a city grows from one million to ten million (as has happened many times in developing nations). Such arguments suggest that the ideas apply only to cities with similar issues to those of New York, where Jacobs developed many of her ideas.\n\n== Works ==\nJane Jacobs spent her life studying cities. Her books include:\n\n=== ''The Death and Life of Great American Cities'' ===\n{{Main|The Death and Life of Great American Cities}}\n''The Death and Life of Great American Cities'' is her single-most influential book and possibly the most influential book on urban planning and cities. Published in 1961, this book was widely read by both planning professionals and the general public; the book is a strong critique of the urban renewal policies of the 1950s, which, she claimed, destroyed communities and created isolated, unnatural urban spaces. In the book she celebrates the diversity and complexity of old-mixed use neighborhoods, while lamenting the monotony and sterility of modern planning.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=9780415252256|pages=405}}</ref> Jacobs advocated the abolition of zoning laws and restoration of free markets in land, which would result in dense, mixed-use neighborhoods and frequently cited New York City's [[Greenwich Village]] as an example of a vibrant urban community.\n\n[[Robert Caro]] has cited it as the strongest influence on ''[[The Power Broker]]'', his [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]]-winning biography of Robert Moses, though Caro does not mention Jacobs by name even once in the book despite Jacobs' battles with Moses over his proposed [[Lower Manhattan Expressway]]. Caro reportedly cut a chapter about Jacobs due to his book's length.<ref>{{cite web|last=Oder|first=Norman|title=The Missing Jane Jacobs Chapter in The Power Broker|url=http://atlanticyardsreport.blogspot.com/2007/10/missing-jane-jacobs-chapter-in-power.html|website=atlanticyardsreport.blogspot.com|accessdate=9 October 2007}}</ref>\n\nBeyond the practical lessons in city design and planning that ''Death and Life'' offers, the theoretical underpinnings of the work challenge the modern development mindset. Jane Jacobs defends her positions with common sense and anecdotes.\n\n=== ''The Economy of Cities'' ===\nThe thesis of this book is that cities are the primary drivers of economic development. Her main argument is that explosive economic growth derives from urban [[import replacement]]. Import replacement is the process of producing goods locally which were formerly imported, e.g., Tokyo bicycle factories replacing Tokyo bicycle importers in the 1800s. Jacobs claims that import replacement builds up local infrastructure, skills, and production. Jacobs also claims that the increased production is subsequently exported to other cities, giving those other cities a new opportunity to engage in import replacement, thus producing a positive cycle of growth.\n\nIn an interview with Bill Steigerwald in ''[[Reason Magazine]]'', Jacobs said that if she is remembered for being a great intellectual she will be remembered not for her work concerning city planning, but for the discovery of [[import replacement]]. Critics erroneously claim that her ideas parrot the idea of [[import substitution industrialization|import substitution]] advanced earlier by scholars such as [[Andre Gunder Frank]]. Import substitution was a national economic theory implying that if a nation substituted its imports with national production the nation would become wealthier, whereas Jacob's idea is entirely about cities and could be called urban import substitution. However, even this would lead to confusion since in practice, import substitution in India and Latin America were government subsidized and mandated, whereas Jacobs' concept of import replacement is a free market process of discovery and division of labor within a city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/archives/2001/06/01/city-views|title=City Views|work=Reason|date=June 2001}}</ref>\n\nIn the second part of the book, Jacobs argues that cities preceded agriculture. She argues that in cities trade in wild animals and grains allowed for the initial division of labor necessary for the discovery of husbandry and agriculture; these discoveries then moved out of the city due to land competition. Another interpretation of history, generally and erroneously considered to be contradictory to Jacobs' is supported by Marxist archaeologist [[Vere Gordon Childe]] and in recent times by another historical materialist [[Charles Keith Maisels]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Maisels|first=Charles Keith|date=1990|title=The Emergence of Civilisation: From Hunting and Gathering to Agriculture, Cities, and the State in the Near East|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}</ref>{{sfn|Soja|2000|p=24}} These writers argue that agriculture preceded cities. The apparent opposition between Childe and Jacobs theories rests in their definition of 'city,' 'civilization,' or 'urban.' Childe, like other materialists such as Maisels or [[Henri Lefebvre]] defines 'urban' or 'civilization' as [[Synoecism]]\u2014as a literate, socially stratified, monolithic political community,{{sfn|Soja|2000|p=25}} whereas, as one can see from ''The Economy of Cities'' or from ''Cities and the Wealth of Nations'', Jacobs defines the city purely along the lines of geographically dense trade giving way to entrepreneurial discovery and subsequent improvements in the division of labor. Without the requirements of literacy, monumental building, or the signs of specialized civil and armed forces, 'cities' can be accurately be interpreted to exists thousands of years before when Childe and Maisels place them. However, Jacobs' definition is supposition, since 'city' is defined simply as a large town or \"a large human settlement\" indicating permanence. The earliest remains of mankind uncovered by archaeologists do not give us more information other than they were hunter-gatherers as there is no evidence yet of farming or settlement, implying nomadic lifestyles until further discoveries are found.<ref>{{cite web|website=bradshawfoundation.com|title=Discovery of Earliest Homo Sapien Skulls backs 'Out of Africa' Theory|first=Clive|last=Cookson|url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/herto_skulls.php}}</ref>\n\n=== ''The Question of Separatism: Quebec and the Struggle over Sovereignty'' ===\n\n''The Question of Separatism'' incorporated and expanded Jacobs' presentation of the 1979 [[Massey Lectures]], entitled ''Canadian Cities and Sovereignty-Association''. It was published in 1980 and reprinted in 2011 with a previously-unpublished 2005 interview with [[Robin Philpot]] on the subject in which she evokes the relative overlooking of that book among her usual readership. This was in fact the first time she was requested to discuss it in an interview. Columnist [[Richard Gwyn]] advanced that while not openly criticizing her, English-speaking Canadians readers thought she did not understood how Canadian politics worked and that she was not being helpful in a time of distress for national unity (the [[1980 Quebec referendum|1980 referendum]] was just defeated by a vote of 60%). ''The Question of Separatism'' was also not mentioned in the bibliography of her 2006 obituary in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Philpot |first=Robin |page=X |chapter=Preface to the 2011 edition |title=Jane Jacobs, The Question of Separatism: Quebec and the Struggle over Sovereignty|trans-title= |publisher=Baraka Books |year=2011|subscription= }}</ref>\n\nJacobs' book advances the view that [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec's eventual independence]] is best for [[Montreal]], Toronto, the rest of Canada, and the world; and that such independence can be achieved peacefully. As precedent, she cites [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden|Norway's secession from Sweden]] and how it enriched both nations. The origins of the contemporary secessionist-movement in the [[Quiet Revolution]] are examined, along with Canada's historical reliance on [[natural resources]] and foreign-owned manufacturing for its own [[economic development]]. Jacobs asserts that such an approach is colonial and hence backward, citing by example Canada buying its [[skis]] and furniture from Norway or Norwegian-owned factories in Canada, the latter procedure being a product of Canadian [[tariff]]s designed specifically to foster such factories. The relevant public views of [[Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque]], [[Claude Ryan]], and then Prime Minister [[Pierre Elliott Trudeau|Pierre Trudeau]] are also critically analyzed, an example being their failure to recognize that two respective, independent [[Currency|currencies]] are essential to the success of an independent Quebec and a smaller resultant Canada, an issue that is central to her book. Jacobs stresses the need for Montreal to continue developing its leadership of [[Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (word)|Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] culture, but that such a need can ultimately never be fulfilled by Montreal's increasing tendencies toward [[regional]]-city status, tendencies foretelling economic, political, and cultural subservience to English-speaking Toronto. Such an outcome, Jacobs believed, would in the long run doom Quebec's independence as much as it would hinder Canada's own future. She concludes with her observation that the popular equating of political secession with political and economic failure is the result of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], which perceived [[nature]] as a force for \"standardization, uniformity, universality, and immutability.\" Since then, naturalists and their readers have gradually realized that nature is a force for diversity, and that, \"diversity itself is of the essence of excellence.\" The right kind of secession, Jacobs states, can lead to the right kind of diversity, and Quebec and Canada are capable of both, and must achieve both, to survive.\n\n=== ''Cities and the Wealth of Nations'' ===\n''[[Cities and the Wealth of Nations]]'' attempts to do for economics what ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]'' did for modern urban planning, though it has not received the same critical attention. Beginning with a concise treatment of classical economics, this book challenges one of the fundamental assumptions of the greatest economists. Classical (and Neo-classical) economists consider the nation-state to be the main player in [[macroeconomics]]. Jacobs argues that it is not the nation-state, rather it is the city which is the true player in this worldwide game. She restates the idea of import replacement from her earlier book ''[[The Economy of Cities]]'', while speculating on the further ramifications of considering the city first and the nation second, or not at all.\n\n=== ''Systems of Survival'' ===\n{{Main|Systems of Survival}}\n\n''Systems of Survival: A Dialogue on the Moral Foundations of Commerce and Politics'' moves outside of the city, studying the moral underpinnings of [[labour (economics)|work]]. As with her other work, she used an observational approach. This book is written as a [[Plato]]nic dialogue. It appears that she (as described by characters in her book) took newspaper clippings of moral judgments related to work, collected and sorted them to find that they fit two patterns of moral behavior that were mutually exclusive. She calls these two patterns \"Moral Syndrome A\", or commercial moral syndrome, and \"Moral Syndrome B\", or guardian moral syndrome. She claims that the commercial moral syndrome is applicable to business owners, scientists, farmers, and traders. Similarly, she claims that the guardian moral syndrome is applicable to government, charities, hunter-gatherers, and religious institutions. She also claims that these Moral Syndromes are fixed, and do not fluctuate over time.\n\nIt is important to stress that Jane Jacobs is providing a theory about the morality of work, and not all moral ideas. Moral ideas that are not included in her system are applicable to both syndromes.\n\nJane Jacobs goes on to describe what happens when these two moral syndromes are mixed, showing the work underpinnings of the [[American Mafia|Mafia]] and communism, and what happens when [[New York City Subway|New York subway]] Police are paid bonuses here \u2013 reinterpreted slightly as a part of the larger analysis.\n\n=== ''The Nature of Economies'' ===\n''The Nature of Economies'', a dialog between friends concerning the premise: \"human beings exist wholly within nature as part of the natural order in every respect\" (p. ''ix''), argues that the same principles underlie both [[ecosystem]]s and [[economic system|economies]]: \"development and co-development through differentiation and their combinations; expansion through diverse, multiple uses of energy; and self-maintenance through self-refueling\" (p.&nbsp;82). Jacobs also comments on the nature of economic and biological diversity and its role in the development and growth of the two kinds of systems.\n\nJacobs' characters discuss the four methods by which \"dynamically stable systems\" may evade collapse: \"bifurcations; [[positive feedback|positive-feedback loops]]; [[negative feedback|negative-feedback controls]]; and emergency adaptations\" (p.&nbsp;86). Their conversations also cover the \"double nature of fitness for survival\" (traits to avoid destroying one's own habitat as well as success in competition to feed and breed, p.&nbsp;119), and unpredictability including the [[butterfly effect]] characterized in terms of multiplicity of variables as well as disproportional response to cause, and [[self-organization]] where \"a system can be making itself up as it goes along\" (p.&nbsp;137).\n\nThe book is infused with many real-world economic and biological examples, which help keep the book \"down to earth\" and comprehensible, if dense. Concepts are furnished with both economic and biological examples, showing their coherence in both worlds.\n\nOne particularly interesting insight is the creation of \"something from nothing\" \u2013 an economy from nowhere. In the biological world, free energy is given through sunlight, but in the economic world human creativity and natural resources supply this free energy, or at least starter energy. Another interesting insight is the creation of economic diversity through the combination of different technologies, for example the typewriter and television as inputs and outputs of a computer system: this can lead to the creation of \"new species of work\".\n\n=== ''Dark Age Ahead'' ===\n{{Main|Dark Age Ahead}}\n\nPublished in 2004 by Random House, ''Dark Age Ahead'' posits Jacobs' argument that \"North American\" civilization shows signs of a spiral decline comparable to the collapse of the Roman empire. Her discussion focuses on \"five pillars of our culture that we depend on to stand firm,\" which can be summarized as the nuclear family and community; quality in education; free thought in science; representational government and responsible taxes; and corporate and professional accountability. As the book's title suggests, Jacobs' outlook is far more pessimistic than that of her previous works. However, in the conclusion she admits: \"At a given time it is hard to tell whether forces of cultural life or death are in the ascendancy. Is suburban sprawl, with its murders of communities and wastes of land, time, and energy, a sign of decay?

He survived the [[Nazi]] [[concentration camp]] [[Bergen Belsen]] along with his parents.\n\n==Youth==\nIscha Meijer was born as the oldest child of historian Jaap Meijer and Liesbeth Voet. He was deported to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp as a baby along with his parents. They managed to survive, and returned to Amsterdam after the [[Second World War|war]], where Ischa's siblings Mirjam and Job were born. The family emigrated to [[Paramaribo]] in [[Surinam]] in the 1950s, fearing a [[communist]] take-over. After a few years the Meijer family returned to Amsterdam after having difficulties adjusting to the environment. Ischa grew up in a family traumatised by the experiences of the [[Holocaust]] which led to emotional as well as alleged physical abuse by his parents. He was thrown out of the house at age eighteen. His parents also ended contact with Ischa's siblings.\n\n==Career==\nIscha started working as a journalist for ''{{ill|De Nieuwe Linie|nl}}''; later on he also started working for the ''[[Haagse Post]]'', ''[[Nieuwe Revu]]'' (national weekly magazine) and ''[[Vrij Nederland]]'' (national weekly magazine). He became well known for his extensive and disclosing interviews. In 1984 he published a controversial interview with politician (and at that time mayor of [[Rotterdam]]) [[Bram Peper]], which caused a lot of commotion throughout the country. The interview eventually was one of the reasons for Peper to divorce his wife, and start a period of heavy [[alcoholism]].\n\n==Radio and Television==\nFor a considerable time Meijer was the host of the radioshow ''Een Uur Ischa'' (One Hour Ischa), later transformed into ''Een Dik Uur Ischa'' (lit. An extended Hour Ischa). He also hosted a late-night show on the television network [[RTL 5]].\n\n==Relationships==\nMeijer had several relationships throughout his life, and also visited [[prostitutes]] on a regular basis, giving him the inspiration to write the book ''Hoeren'' (Hookers) (1980). In the late 1980s Meijer had a relationship with comedian and actress [[Jenny Arean]]. In the years preceding his death he had a solid relationship with writer [[Connie Palmen]], who wrote a book about her relationship with Ischa, called ''I.M.'' (1998).\n\n==Death and legacy==\nIscha continued throughout his life searching for the love his parents never gave to him. When Ischa's mother became seriously ill in 1993, Ischa and his siblings were not allowed to say goodbye. Several weeks after her death Ischa's father Jaap died as well.\n\nOn 14 February 1995, on his 52nd birthday, Ischa Meijer died of a heart attack while on his way to his coffeehouse to celebrate his birthday. He left behind a son, Jeroen, and a daughter, Jessica. Dutch news media gave much attention to his death.\n\nThat same year he was given posthumous recognition for his work by receiving the {{ill|Zilveren Reissmicrofoon|nl}}, an important award in the world of Dutch radio. Besides the book ''I.M.'' another book was launched concerning the life of Meijer, this time by his sister Mirjam who wrote the book ''Mijn broer Ischa'' (My brother Ischa) (1997). Meijer also played a background role in another book by Connie Palmen, ''Geheel de Uwe'' (Entirely Yours).\n\nA documentary on Meijer's life was broadcast on Dutch television on 14 February 2005 called ''Ik hou van mij'' (I love myself), made by documentary maker Kees de Groot van Embden.\n\n==Filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Its foundation was due to the initiative of [[James Forbes (minister)|James Forbes]], of the Free Presbyterian Church, who arrived in 1838 as the first settled Christian minister in what became the colony of Victoria in 1851. It is \"the outcome of the old Scottish ideal of education\", in which church and school were inextricably connected. The school opened on 6 October 1851, under the name of the Melbourne Academy in a small house in Spring Street, with Robert Lawson, a Scot from [[Edinburgh University]], as the first principal. The house was soon outgrown, as was a larger one on the northwest corner of Spring and Little Collins Streets (later the Ulster Family Hotel) and the Church applied to the government for a grant of land. Two acres were reserved for the school on Eastern Hill and substantial new buildings were erected there in 1853. The cost was met partly by a government grant and partly from funds raised by the friends of the school.\n\nLawson resigned in 1856. Under his successor, [[Alexander Morrison (headmaster)|Alexander Morrison]], the school grew and prospered; it came under the oversight of the newly formed [[Presbyterian Church of Victoria]] in 1859. Morrison had been Rector of [[Hamilton Academy]] and remained at Scotch for 46 years, during almost all of which time his brother Robert was a master of the college.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pearl|first=Cyril|title=Morrison of Peking|publisher=Angus & Robertson|place=Sydney,Australia|date=1967}}</ref>{{rp|2}} [[William Still Littlejohn]], who took over the school in 1904, served for 29 years, and his successor, [[Colin Gilray|Colin Macdonald Gilray]], for 19. So, when the school became the first in Victoria to celebrate its centenary, Gilray was only the fourth principal.\n\nGilray was succeeded in 1953 by R. Selby Smith, an Old Rugbeian who had served in the [[Royal Navy]] during the war and was at the time of his appointment Deputy Director of Education for [[Warwickshire]]. Smith resigned in 1964 to become the Foundation Dean of Education at [[Monash University]].\n\nC. O. Healey, who had been Headmaster of [[Sydney Grammar School]] since 1951, succeeded Smith. Healey retired in January 1975.\n\nIn the following May, P. A. V. Roff, formerly Headmaster of [[Scotch College, Adelaide]], was installed as the seventh principal of the college. Roff's tenure, though a brief seven years, was characterised by an expanding voice for staff in the day-to-day management of the school, the establishment of a Foundation Office at the School under the direction of a Development Officer and the widening of the House System to provide greater depth in pastoral care. His last few years saw the school in dispute over ownership and, for the principal and his school community, it was a time of stress. In 1980 the decision was made to incorporate the school and a new Council was appointed, with representatives from the Presbyterian Church, the Old Scotch Collegians' Association and the community at large.\n\nF. G. Donaldson, a vice principal from [[Wallace High School (Northern Ireland)]], with a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[atomic physics]] from [[Queens University Belfast]], succeeded Roff in 1983. Under his principalship there was a significant building program that created new facilities for the education of boys, the development of ICT for administrative and educational purposes, and enhanced pastoral care of students.\n\nI. Tom Batty was appointed as the ninth principal of Scotch and installed into office on 14 July 2008. Prior to his appointment he was Housemaster of Villiers House, [[Eton College]] in the UK. The early years of Batty's tenure have seen the introduction of a new House-based pastoral care structure in the Upper School, which began at the start of the 2011 school year.\n\n==Name==\n[[File:scotch college callantina gatehouse.JPG|thumb|right|The name \"''Scotch College''\" appears at the entrance to the boarding precinct (2009)]]\nThe School was originally called \"''The Melbourne Academy''\", after its location, when it opened in 1851.

The Presbyterian Church of Australia continued with the remaining congregations.  In the split, Scotch College, Melbourne was allocated to the [[Presbyterian Church of Australia]] by the Handley Commission which was appointed to distribute the assets of the churches, which included an even number of representatives from the Uniting Church and the continuing Presbyterian Church as well as independent commissioners.

site (circa 1906) prior to moving to the current site at [[Hawthorn, Victoria|Hawthorn]]]]\nScotch College is the oldest surviving secondary school in Victoria. Its foundation was due to the initiative of [[James Forbes (minister)|James Forbes]], of the Free Presbyterian Church, who arrived in 1838 as the first settled Christian minister in what became the colony of Victoria in 1851. It is \"the outcome of the old Scottish ideal of education\", in which church and school were inextricably connected. The school opened on 6 October 1851, under the name of the Melbourne Academy in a small house in Spring Street, with Robert Lawson, a Scot from [[Edinburgh University]], as the first principal. The house was soon outgrown, as was a larger one on the northwest corner of Spring and Little Collins Streets (later the Ulster Family Hotel) and the Church applied to the government for a grant of land. Two acres were reserved for the school on Eastern Hill and substantial new buildings were erected there in 1853. The cost was met partly by a government grant and partly from funds raised by the friends of the school.\n\nLawson resigned in 1856. Under his successor, [[Alexander Morrison (headmaster)|Alexander Morrison]], the school grew and prospered; it came under the oversight of the newly formed [[Presbyterian Church of Victoria]] in 1859. Morrison had been Rector of [[Hamilton Academy]] and remained at Scotch for 46 years, during almost all of which time his brother Robert was a master of the college.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pearl|first=Cyril|title=Morrison of Peking|publisher=Angus & Robertson|place=Sydney,Australia|date=1967}}</ref>{{rp|2}} [[William Still Littlejohn]], who took over the school in 1904, served for 29 years, and his successor, [[Colin Gilray|Colin Macdonald Gilray]], for 19. So, when the school became the first in Victoria to celebrate its centenary, Gilray was only the fourth principal.\n\nGilray was succeeded in 1953 by R. Selby Smith, an Old Rugbeian who had served in the [[Royal Navy]] during the war and was at the time of his appointment Deputy Director of Education for [[Warwickshire]]. Smith resigned in 1964 to become the Foundation Dean of Education at [[Monash University]].\n\nC. O. Healey, who had been Headmaster of [[Sydney Grammar School]] since 1951, succeeded Smith. Healey retired in January 1975.\n\nIn the following May, P. A. V. Roff, formerly Headmaster of [[Scotch College, Adelaide]], was installed as the seventh principal of the college. Roff's tenure, though a brief seven years, was characterised by an expanding voice for staff in the day-to-day management of the school, the establishment of a Foundation Office at the School under the direction of a Development Officer and the widening of the House System to provide greater depth in pastoral care. His last few years saw the school in dispute over ownership and, for the principal and his school community, it was a time of stress. In 1980 the decision was made to incorporate the school and a new Council was appointed, with representatives from the Presbyterian Church, the Old Scotch Collegians' Association and the community at large.\n\nF. G. Donaldson, a vice principal from [[Wallace High School (Northern Ireland)]], with a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[atomic physics]] from [[Queens University Belfast]], succeeded Roff in 1983. Under his principalship there was a significant building program that created new facilities for the education of boys, the development of ICT for administrative and educational purposes, and enhanced pastoral care of students.\n\nI. Tom Batty was appointed as the ninth principal of Scotch and installed into office on 14 July 2008. Prior to his appointment he was Housemaster of Villiers House, [[Eton College]] in the UK. The early years of Batty's tenure have seen the introduction of a new House-based pastoral care structure in the Upper School, which began at the start of the 2011 school year.\n\n==Name==\n[[File:scotch college callantina gatehouse.JPG|thumb|right|The name \"''Scotch College''\" appears at the entrance to the boarding precinct (2009)]]\nThe School was originally called \"''The Melbourne Academy''\", after its location, when it opened in 1851.

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the twenty-first film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film is written and directed by [[Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck]], with [[Geneva Robertson-Dworet]] also contributing to the screenplay. [[Brie Larson]] stars as Danvers, alongside [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Ben Mendelsohn]], [[Djimon Hounsou]], [[Lee Pace]], [[Lashana Lynch]], [[Gemma Chan]], [[Annette Bening]], [[Clark Gregg]], and [[Jude Law]]. Set in 1995, the story follows Danvers as she becomes [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]] after Earth is caught in the center of a galactic conflict between two alien civilizations. \n\nDevelopment of the film began as early as May 2013. It was officially announced in October 2014 as Marvel Studios' first female-led superhero film. [[Nicole Perlman]] and [[Meg LeFauve]] were hired as a writing team the following April after submitting separate takes on the character. The story borrows elements from [[Roy Thomas]]'s 1971 \"[[Kree\u2013Skrull War]]\" comic book storyline. Larson was announced as Danvers at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con]], with Boden and Fleck hired to direct in April 2017. Robertson-Dworet soon took over scripting duties, with the remainder of the cast added by the start of filming. [[Location shooting]] began in January 2018, with [[principal photography]] beginning that March in California before concluding in Louisiana in July 2018. Jackson and Gregg\u2014who, among others, reprise their roles from previous MCU films\u2014were digitally [[De-aging in film|de-aged]] in [[post-production]] to reflect the film's 1990s setting.\n\n''Captain Marvel'' premiered in London on February 27, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on March 8. The film grossed over $1.1&nbsp;billion worldwide, making it the first female-led superhero film to pass the billion-dollar mark. It ranks as the [[2019 in film#Highest-grossing films|fifth-highest-grossing film of 2019]], and became the [[List of highest-grossing superhero films|<!--This is the '''peak''' position the film achieved (April 21\u201328, 2019), not the current. Please do NOT adjust!-->ninth-highest-grossing superhero film]] and [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing films|23rd<!--This is the PEAK POSITION the film achieved NOT the CURRENT. Please do NOT adjust!-->-highest-grossing film]] overall at the time. The film received praise for the performances of the cast, particularly that of Larson. A sequel is in development, with an expected 2022 release.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1995, on the [[Kree]] Empire's capital planet of Hala, [[Starforce]] member [[Carol Danvers|Vers]] suffers from amnesia and recurring nightmares involving an older woman. [[Yon-Rogg]], her mentor and commander, trains her to control her abilities while the [[Supreme Intelligence]], the artificial intelligence that rules the Kree, urges her to keep her emotions in check. <!--the onscreen caption when Vers goes up the steps to the Supreme Intelligence says only \"AI\" and no dialogue calls it organic-->\n\nDuring a mission to rescue an undercover operative infiltrating a group of [[Skrull]]s, alien shapeshifters with whom the Kree are at war, Vers is captured by Skrull commander [[Talos (comics)|Talos]]. A probe of Vers's memories leads them to Earth. Vers escapes and crash-lands in Los Angeles. Her presence attracts [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] and [[Phil Coulson]], whose investigation is interrupted by a Skrull attack. In the ensuing chase, Vers recovers a crystal containing her extracted memories while Fury kills a Skrull impersonating Coulson. Talos, disguised as Fury's boss Keller, orders Fury to work with Vers and keep tabs on her.\n\nUsing her extracted memories, Vers and Fury go to the [[Project Pegasus]] installation at a [[U.S. Air Force]] base. They discover Vers was a pilot presumed to have died in 1989 while testing an experimental light-speed engine designed by Dr. [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Wendy Lawson]], whom Vers recognizes as the woman from her nightmares. After Fury informs S.H.I.E.L.D. of their location, a team led by Talos disguised as Keller arrives. Fury discovers Talos's ruse and helps Vers escape in a cargo jet<!--Term \"quadjet\" is never used in the film. We had RfC debate over this over the term \"Mjolnir\" in Iron Man 2 and consensus is that it is OR to use terms the manifest content of the movie itself does not make--> with Lawson's stowaway cat Goose. They fly to [[Louisiana]] to meet former pilot Maria Rambeau, the last person to see Vers and Lawson alive.\n\nRambeau and her daughter [[Monica Rambeau|Monica]] reveal that Vers is Carol Danvers, who was once like family to them. Talos, arriving unarmed, explains that the Skrulls are refugees searching for a new home and that Lawson was Mar-Vell, a renegade Kree scientist helping them. Talos plays a recovered recording from Lawson's jet, prompting Danvers to remember the crash: Lawson was killed by Yon-Rogg to prevent her from destroying the engine before the Kree could recover it. Destroying the engine herself, Danvers absorbed the energy from the ensuing explosion, gaining powers but losing her memory.\n\nDanvers, Talos, Fury, and Rambeau locate Lawson's cloaked laboratory orbiting Earth, where Lawson hid several Skrulls, including Talos's family, and the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]], the power source of Lawson's engine. There, Danvers is captured by Starforce and interfaces with the Supreme Intelligence. During their conversation, Danvers removes the Kree implant that was suppressing her powers, allowing her to reach her full potential. In the subsequent battle, Fury retrieves Goose, who is revealed to be an alien [[Flerken]]. Goose swallows the Tesseract and scratches Fury, blinding his left eye. Danvers destroys a Kree bomber, forcing Kree officer [[Ronan the Accuser]] and his squadron to retreat, before overpowering Yon-Rogg on Earth and sending him back to Hala with a warning to the Supreme Intelligence.\n\nDanvers departs to help the Skrulls find a new homeworld, leaving Fury a modified [[pager]] to contact her in an emergency. Meanwhile, Fury drafts an initiative to locate heroes like Danvers, naming it after her Air Force [[Aviator call sign|call sign]], \"Avenger\". In a [[mid-credits scene]], set in 2018, the activated pager{{refn|name=CaptainMarvel1|group=N|As depicted in the 2018 film ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''.<ref name=\"CaptainMarvel\" />}} is being monitored by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] when Danvers appears.{{refn|name=CaptainMarvel2|group=N|This scene was directed by ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' directors [[Anthony and Joe Russo]] as a lead-in to that film.<ref name=\"CaptainMarvelMidCredits\" />}} In a post-credits scene, Goose climbs onto Fury's desk and regurgitates the Tesseract.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Order per billing block -->\n{{multiple image\n| align             = right\n| direction         = vertical\n| width             = 220\n| image1            = Captain Marvel trailer at the National Air and Space Museum 2.jpg\n| alt1              = \n| image2            = Samuel L.

Mendelsohn uses an American accent inspired by former [[United States Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] for Keller, and his native Australian accent for Talos; the latter was chosen, after a \"lengthy discussion\", due to what Mendelsohn called \"earthy correctness\". The makeup and prosthetics necessary to portray Talos took \"a couple of hours\" to apply.<ref name=\"EWMendelsohn\" /> Executive producer Johnathan Schwartz added that \"it's sort of fun to show off both the Skrull's powers and Ben's range as an actor\" with the character.<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" /> Talos also takes on a surfer girl form portrayed by Emily Ozrey and Abigaille Ozrey, and a Kree soldier disguise played by [[Duane Henry]].<ref name=\"PressKit\" />\n* [[Djimon Hounsou]] as [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]]: <br />A Kree swordsman and second-in-command of Starforce.<ref name=\"THRFilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"MeetStarforceCharacters\" /> Hounsou explained that Korath was \"at his infancy\" in the film compared to his appearance in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014), but was \"still a humorless machine\".<ref name=\"EWMagCoverStory\" />\n* [[Lee Pace]] as [[Ronan the Accuser]]: <br />A high-ranking Kree official.<ref name=\"THRFilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"/FilmEWPhotos\" /> Compared to his appearance in ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', Ronan is not yet a \"radical zealot\", with his role in the Kree military intersecting with Starforce \"in an interesting way\".<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" />\n* [[Lashana Lynch]] as Maria Rambeau: <br />One of Danvers' oldest friends and a fellow Air Force pilot who goes by the call sign \"Photon\".

In particular, she met with pilots who are also mothers. Lynch was excited to portray a character the audience would be proud of and could relate to, especially mothers and members of the black community, helping to continue \"a real through-line\" for African-American characters in the MCU after ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' (2018).<ref name=\"EWLynch\" />\n* [[Gemma Chan]] as [[Doctor Minerva|Minn-Erva]]: <br />A Kree sniper and member of Starforce.<ref name=\"EWMagCoverStory\" /><ref name=\"EWLaw\" /> Chan explained that Minn-Erva was \"the star of Starforce\" before Danvers joined the team and is \"slightly threatened by someone else who has come in and is also very talented\".<ref name=\"EWMagCoverStory\" />\n* [[Annette Bening]] as the [[Supreme Intelligence]] and [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Mar-Vell / Dr. Wendy Lawson]]: <br />The Supreme Intelligence is an [[artificial intelligence]] that is the collective embodiment of the greatest minds of the Kree people, and the ruler of the Kree Empire.<ref name=\"Bening\" /><ref name=\"BeningSupremeIntelligence\" /> It appears in different forms to each person,<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" /> specifically to Vers as rebel Kree scientist Mar-Vell, who had disguised herself on Earth as Danvers' boss Dr. Wendy Lawson.<ref name=\"BeningLawson\" /> Mar-Vell was originally written as a male love interest to Danvers as in the comics, but after struggling to cast the character co-director [[Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck|Anna Boden]] suggested that they cast a woman instead, and tie her into the Supreme Intelligence storyline by combining those characters. Boden said Bening was \"regal\" as the Supreme Intelligence, and \"casual and cool and laid back\" as Lawson.<ref name=\"BodenBeningMar2019\" /> Feige said changing Mar-Vell's gender was important to Danvers' development in the film, giving her a female mentor.<ref name=\"FeigeBeningMar2019\" />\n* [[Clark Gregg]] as [[Phil Coulson]]: <br />A rookie agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. who works closely with Fury.<ref name=\"EWGreggSept2018\" /> Gregg said the film would be \"the earliest we will have seen [Coulson in the MCU], so when he says, 'Mr. Stark, this isn't my first rodeo' in ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008), this is maybe the rodeo he's talking about.\"<ref name=\"GreggEWMay2018\" /> He had to work to portray Coulson \"a little less crusty and jaded\" as he is in the present of the MCU.<ref name=\"EWGreggSept2018\" /> Though Coulson encountered the Kree in the MCU television series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', Schwartz noted that ''Captain Marvel'' would not need to worry about that since it is a prequel where Kree is not even \"part of his vocabulary yet\".<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitSchwartzPg2\" /> Like Jackson, Gregg was digitally de-aged by 25 years.<ref name=\"Feige/FilmJul2018\" />\n* [[Jude Law]] as [[Yon-Rogg]]: <br />The commander of Starforce and Danvers' mentor, who trains her to use her new powers.<ref name=\"PressKit\" /><ref name=\"FinalBTSConfirmation\" /> Law said that his character is \"driven by a belief in the divine leadership of the Kree people.

Producer Jeremy Latcham elaborated that \"getting the character right first is going to lead the charge\".<ref name=\"FeigeSept2015\" /> In October 2015, Marvel changed the release date again, this time moving it to March 8, 2019, due to ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'' (2018).<ref name=\"Phase3Update\" />\n\nFeige stated in April 2016 that a director would be announced within a few months and that the first cast members would be announced in mid-2016. He also mentioned that the film would be about Carol Danvers becoming Captain Marvel.<ref name=\"FeigeApr2016\" /> The next month, indie filmmaker [[Emily Carmichael (filmmaker)|Emily Carmichael]]'s name surfaced as a possible contender to direct the film,<ref name=\"Carmichael\" /> and by June, [[Brie Larson]] emerged as the frontrunner to play Captain Marvel.<ref name=\"Larson2\" /> Larson's casting was confirmed at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con]].<ref name=\"LarsonConfirm\" /> She was set to earn $5&nbsp;million for the film.<ref name=\"LarsonPay\" /> Larson was initially hesitant to accept the role, but \"couldn't deny the fact that this movie is everything I care about, everything that's progressive and important and meaningful, and a symbol I wished I would've had growing up\".<ref name=\"LarsonVanityFair\" /> She was able to bring to the part \"some of those [deep emotional] things\" she had used in previous, more \"dramatic roles\". Larson felt this would differentiate ''Captain Marvel'' from other superhero films.<ref name=\"EWCoverLarson\" /> Also at Comic-Con, Feige said the search for a director had narrowed to ten candidates, and hoped to announce the final choice in the coming months.<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" />\n\nPerlman revealed in August that the character's origin story had been changed for the film due to similarities with the [[DC Comics]] character [[Green Lantern]],<ref name=\"PerlmanAug2016\" /> with Feige explaining that the new story is centered on Danvers finding her limitations and vulnerabilities. He added that Danvers is the most powerful character in the MCU, and would become a very important in the franchise.<ref name=\"FeigeOct2016\" /> Producer Nate Moore said the film avoids the traditional structure of many MCU origin stories, which he described as a character having a problem before gaining \"powers at the end of the first act, and the end of the second act they learn about the powers, the third act they probably fight a villain who has a function of the same powers\";<ref name=\"MooreMay2018\" /> instead, Danvers starts the film having already gained her powers.<ref name=\"EWCover\" />\n\nIn October 2016, Feige admitted that the announcement for a director was taking longer than he previously expected, and explained that the studio was now waiting for more of the film's story to be defined in the script so they could then talk to potential directors about it. Once again talking about hiring a female filmmaker to direct the film, Feige said that he did not think it would be a requirement to make a \"great version\" of the film, but it was something that Marvel felt was important to consider, even if that female filmmaker does not know a lot about the comics, as \"they just have to fall in love with it once they are presented with it. It's amazing to see all of the filmmakers read through [the source material] and know, 'Oh, a female's writing it now{{'\"}}, speaking in particular to [[Kelly Sue DeConnick]]'s run in the comics.<ref name=\"FeigeOct2016\" /> Feige expected a director to be announced by the end of 2016;<ref name=\"FeigeDirectorEnd2016\" /> however, Perlman and LeFauve turned in a script treatment around December, pushing additional meetings with director candidates into early 2017.<ref name=\"ScriptDirectorUpdate\" />\n\nIn February 2017, Perlman stated that despite her and LeFauve being hired almost a year previously, the duo had only recently gotten their \"marching orders\" for the script, stating one of the reasons for the delay was figuring out where the film would fit within the MCU. Perlman also discussed the character's femininity, feeling that it was important to make sure she is not \"somebody who is a hero in spite of her femininity ... being a woman is part of [her] strength\". The writers were also considerate of tropes that could be diminishing to a female character but not for male characters, such as things they would not have been concerned writing for [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Iron Man]] but did not play the same way for Captain Marvel.<ref name=\"PerlmanPodcast\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\n{{quote box|width=33%|quote=This is not a superhero who's perfect or otherworldly. ...

Feige felt the film had to focus on the complexity and relatability of Carol Danvers' character without being bogged down by the villains and the special effects, and thought that Boden and Fleck could provide this character focus.<ref name=\"FeigeVultureApr2017\" /> Filming was scheduled to begin in January 2018, at [[Pinewood Studios#Pinewood Atlanta|Pinewood Atlanta Studios]] in [[Fayette County, Georgia]],<ref name=\"FilmingLocation\" /> but Feige said he did not expect it to begin until February.<ref name=\"FebFilmingStart\" />\n\nBy July 2017, [[Samuel L. Jackson]] was set to appear in the film, reprising his role as [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]].<ref name=\"Jackson\" /> Larson, who worked with Jackson on ''[[Kong: Skull Island]]'' (2017), pushed for Fury's presence in the film.<ref name=\"LarsonFury\" /> At the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con, Feige revealed that the film would take place in the 1990s and that the [[Skrulls]] would be the film's villains, allowing elements from the \"[[Kree\u2013Skrull War]]\" (1971) comic book storyline to be used.<ref name=\"2017SDCC\" /><ref name=\"Kree\u2013Skrull War\" /> By setting the film in the 1990s, Feige noted that Danvers would \"be the singular hero\" while still giving her a definitive placing in the MCU timeline.<ref name=\"FeigeMar2018\" /> Executive producer Jonathan Schwartz said setting the film in the 1990s was an idea from early in the development process, and gave the character a special place and significance within the MCU. It also allowed the film to make connections to plot details from past MCU films that are set later in the timeline.<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" /> Regarding the elements from the \"Kree\u2013Skrull War\" used for the film, Schwartz said some paranoia elements would be featured but would not be related to the Anti-Superhero Act as in the comics. He added that the Kree-Skrull conflict is would mostly be a \"backdrop and mythological underpinning\" for the film.<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitSchwartzPg2\" /> In response to the Comic-Con announcements, Graeme McMillan of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' compared the film to ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' (2011) and the [[DC Extended Universe]] film ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' (2017), as they were also set decades before present day. By setting the film in the 1990s, McMillan felt it would create the question of \"what happened to Captain Marvel to take her off the playing field ahead of the Marvel movies that we've seen to date?\".<ref name=\"THRComparison\" />\n\n[[File:Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck at the Pentagon.jpg|thumb|left|Directors Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden speaking at [[The Pentagon]] in March 2019]]\nAlso in July, the [[California Film Commission]] awarded a $20.7{{nbsp}}million tax credit to the production,<ref name=\"CaliforniaTaxCredit\" /> going towards the first $100{{nbsp}}million spent on qualified in-state expenditures,<ref name=\"CaliforniaTaxCredit2\" /> making California the main filming location for ''Captain Marvel''. D'Esposito was excited about this, given Marvel Studios' headquarters and post-production facilities are also in the state, allowing them to streamline the production process for this film and others.<ref name=\"CaliforniaTaxCredit\" /> Awarding of the tax credit was dependent on filming beginning within 180 days.<ref name=\"CaliforniaTaxCreditPDF\" /> Marvel planned to spend $118.6&nbsp;million filming in the state, for a net of $97.8&nbsp;million after the tax credit was applied.<ref name=\"CFCBudget\" /> Schwartz said one of the reasons Los Angeles was chosen for filming was because \"not a lot of big movies shoot in LA anymore, so it weirdly feels like fresh territory for a movie like this\".<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitSchwartzPg3\" />\n\n[[Geneva Robertson-Dworet]] was hired by mid-August to take over the scripting duties for ''Captain Marvel'' after LeFauve left the project to co-direct ''[[Gigantic (2020 film)|Gigantic]]'' for [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney Animation]].<ref name=\"Robertson-Dworet\" /> Perlman also left the project, but stated that the story she and LeFauve had worked on in earlier drafts would be retained in the final screenplay.<ref name=\"PerlmanAugust2017\" /> Robertson-Dworet described the film as an action-comedy, and likened her script to an initial one she wrote for ''[[Tomb Raider (film)|Tomb Raider]]'' (2018) before that film took a more dramatic tone. She added that it was important to the entire creative team to keep the comedic elements of the film and the sassiness of Danvers' character. Robertson-Dworet also credited Boden for helping to shape Danvers' voice in the film and the desire \"to carve our own path and make sure we weren't retreading the same territory [after the release of ''Wonder Woman''], and showing all facets of what women are capable of\".<ref name=\"RobertsonDworetEWMar2018\" /> Feige added that ''Captain Marvel'' would have action scenes that would pay homage to 1990s action films, including ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991), since the 1990s action genre was one Marvel Studios had yet to explore. He also stated much of the film would take place in outer space.<ref name=\"FeigeMar2018\" /> ''[[RoboCop]]'' (1987), ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (1971), and ''[[The Conversation]]'' (1974) also served as influences on ''Captain Marvel'' for Boden and Fleck. Speaking specifically to ''RoboCop'', the directors were drawn to \"this idea of a character who's finding himself and finding his past\" from that film and how it could connect to the story they were telling in ''Captain Marvel''.<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitDirectors\" /> DeConnick and quantum physicist Spyridon Michalakis, of the Institute for Quantum Information and Matter at the [[California Institute of Technology]], consulted on the film.<ref name=\"ColliderDec2018\" /><ref name=\"ScienceConsultant\" />\n\nBy October, filming was slated to begin in March 2018. Feige said the film would play a significant role in setting up ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' which was scheduled for release after ''Captain Marvel''.<ref name=\"MarFilmingStart\" /> [[Ben Mendelsohn]] entered negotiations to join the film as the main villain,<ref name=\"Mendelsohn\" /> having previously worked with Boden and Fleck on their film ''[[Mississippi Grind]]'' (2015). They had him in mind for the ''Captain Marvel'' villain when they first began working on this film's story, and Mendelsohn agreed to play the role shortly after discussing the film with the directors.<ref name=\"Mendelsohn2\" /> By November, [[Jude Law]] was in negotiations to join the film, which at the time was reported to be the role of [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Walter Lawson / Mar-Vell]].<ref name=\"Law\" /> In January 2018, [[DeWanda Wise]] was cast as Maria Rambeau,<ref name=\"EWLynch\" /><ref name=\"Wise\" /> and Mendelsohn and Law were confirmed to have been cast.<ref name=\"Wise\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[File:Captain Marvel filming at Edwards AFB.jpg|thumb|Filming of ''Captain Marvel'' at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in April 2018]]\n[[Location shooting]] occurred at the end of January 2018.<ref name=\"JanLocationShooting\" /><ref name=\"LocationShooting\" /> Set photos taken at that time showed Larson in a green and black uniform instead of the character's familiar red and blue suit. Feige responded by saying that Marvel accepts the risk of set photos being leaked as a consequence of location shooting, and felt that \"most people are savvy enough to know they're looking at a behind-the-scenes photo, completely out of context\". He added that a large number of scenes in the film would be shot on location.<ref name=\"LocationShooting\" />\n\nA month later, [[Gemma Chan]] joined the cast as [[Doctor Minerva|Minn-Erva]].<ref name=\"Chan\" /> In mid-March, Wise withdrew from the film due to a scheduling conflict with her television series ''[[She's Gotta Have It (TV series)|She's Gotta Have It]]''.<ref name=\"NoWise\" /> [[Lashana Lynch]] entered into negotiations to replace Wise the next day,<ref name=\"Lynch\" /> and was confirmed for the role by the end of the month. At that time, [[Djimon Hounsou]], [[Lee Pace]], and [[Clark Gregg]] were set to reprise their respective roles of [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]], [[Ronan the Accuser]], and [[Phil Coulson]] from earlier MCU films; as those characters were all killed in their previous appearances, Richard Newby of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' described the film as a unique opportunity to \"strengthen the presence of [the characters] who may not have lived up to their potential\".<ref name=\"THRMar2018\" /> [[Algenis Perez Soto]], [[Rune Temte]], and [[Mckenna Grace]] were also cast.<ref name=\"FullCastAnnouncement\" /><ref name=\"THRFilmingStart\" /> Marvel revealed that Boden, Fleck, and the writing team of [[Liz Flahive]] and [[Carly Mensch]] had worked on the screenplay in addition to LeFauve, Perlman, and Robertson-Dworet.<ref name=\"FullCastAnnouncement\" /> Bek Smith, who previously worked in Marvel's screenwriter program, performed uncredited production rewrites.<ref name=\"SmithRewrites\" />\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on March 19 in Los Angeles,<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> at Sony Studios under the [[working title]] ''Open World''.<ref name=\"SonyStudios\" /><ref name=\"LouisianaBudget\" /> Schwartz stated that ''Open World'' was chosen as a working title because it likened the film to an [[open world]] video game that could go in many directions, which is how the production felt about ''Captain Marvel''{{'}}s story at the time.<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" /> A 1986 carnival scene was filmed later that week at the [[Jim Hall (racing driver)|Jim Hall Racing Club]] in [[Oxnard, California]].<ref name=\"OxnardFilming\" /> Filming of ''Captain Marvel'' in Los Angeles, along with other big-budget films that took advantage of California's improved tax credit program, helped raise on-location feature film production in the area by 11.7% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, the first such double-figure increase since the fourth quarter of 2015.<ref name=\"FilmingIncrease\" /> Filming at [[Shaver Lake]] outside [[Fresno, California]] was set to take place in April<ref name=\"ShaverLake\" /> but was pushed back to mid-May.<ref name=\"ShaverLake2\" /><ref name=\"ShaverLake3\" /> In late April, Feige stated that almost half of filming was completed.<ref name=\"FeigeApr2018\" /> The following month, [[Annette Bening]] joined the cast in an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"Bening\" /> Additional location shooting in and around the Los Angeles area included [[Simi Valley, California|Simi Valley]], [[Edwards Air Force Base]], and [[Lucerne Valley, California|Lucerne Valley]].<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitSchwartzPg5\" /> In late June, production moved to [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] and [[New Orleans]] for two weeks.<ref name=\"FullCastAnnouncement\" /><ref name=\"CaliforniaFilmingEnd\" /> A realistic cat puppet was used on set as Larson is allergic to cats.<ref name=\"EWGoose\" /> Scenes featuring the interior of the Quadjet were filmed on the set used to depict the interior of Quinjets on the MCU television series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''<ref name=\"SharedSet\"/> Filming concluded on July 6.<ref name=\"FilmingEnd\" />\n\nCinematographer [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]] shot primarily on large-format [[Arri Alexa]] 65 cameras, liking how the camera rendered the film's costumes.<ref name=\"ICG\" /> Davis, who previously served as director of photography for ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', and ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'' (2016),<ref name=\"FullCastAnnouncement\" /> noted that there was a \"point of departure\" in the visuals of ''Captain Marvel'' coming from its 1990s setting.<ref name=\"Yahoo!Davis\" /> To achieve the 1990s aesthetic, Davis first attempted to utilize post-production techniques to convey a period look, but found that it just softened the image. He then tried using vintage [[Cooke Optics|Cooke]] Panchro and [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] K-35 lenses, but they were not compatible with the large-format of the Arri Alexa camera system.<ref name=\"VarietyDavis\" /> Davis ultimately enlisted Dan Sasaki of [[Panavision]] to make new lenses for the period scenes that could work with the cameras. Davis initially intended not to use these lenses for scenes set in space to differentiate them, but found himself using the lenses for some close-ups set in space because he liked the way they looked.<ref name=\"ICG\" />\n\n=== Post-production === \nAdditional photography was confirmed to have begun via set photos in late November 2018.<ref name=\"AdditionalPhotography\" /> With the release of the theatrical poster in early December, Marvel revealed that the writing team of Joe Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse had worked on the film's story, while [[Jac Schaeffer]] had contributed to the screenplay.<ref name=\"SecondTrailerAndPoster\" /> Schaeffer had previously been hired by Marvel to write ''[[Black Widow (2020 film)|Black Widow]]'' (2020).<ref name=\"SchaefferBW\" /> Bening's and Law's roles were officially confirmed in February 2019 as the [[Supreme Intelligence]] and [[Yon-Rogg]], respectively.<ref name=\"BeningSupremeIntelligence\" /><ref name=\"FinalBTSConfirmation\" />\n\nThe film was edited by [[Elliot Graham]] and [[Debbie Berman]], marking Berman's third time co-editing an MCU film after ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' and ''Black Panther''.<ref name=\"BermanBI\" /> ''Captain Marvel'' was edited using [[Avid Media Composer]] software in the [[Avid DNxHD]] codec on [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] computers.<ref name=\"BermanFrame\" /> Berman first became involved with the film when she was working on ''Homecoming'' and Boden and Fleck were hired, and was hired herself for ''Captain Marvel'' the first week she was working on ''Black Panther''.<ref name=\"BermanBI\" /> In addition to Graham and Berman, the editing team was made up of first assistants Jessica Baclesse and Kimberly Boritz, second assistants Basuki Juwono and Christos Voutsinas, and assistant editor Joe Galdo, among others.

''One Eight Seven'' (1997) was used as a primary reference to [[De-aging in film|de-age]] Jackson in ''Captain Marvel'', which is set in 1995.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />]]\nVisual effects for the film were created by [[Animal Logic]], Cantina Creative, [[Digital Domain]], [[Framestore]], [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), Lola VFX, [[Luma Pictures]], Rise, [[Rising Sun Pictures]], [[Scanline VFX]], Trixter, and Elastic,<ref name=\"VFXCompanies\" /> with Lola VFX working on the de-aging of Jackson and Gregg.<ref name=\"LolaVFX\" /> Lola looked at several of Jackson's films, including ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' (1994), ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'' (1995), ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993), ''[[Loaded Weapon 1]]'' (1993), and ''[[One Eight Seven]]'' (1997), as a reference for his de-aging. However, some of these films were disqualified due to circumstances around the character Jackson was playing; ''Pulp Fiction'' because of the character's wig and facial hair, and ''Jurassic Park'' because the character was made to appear older in that film. Lola VFX supervisor Trent Claus said the final look was based partly on ''Die Hard'' and ''Loaded Weapon 1'', but mostly on ''One Eight Seven'' which he described as the \"hero movie\". Jackson was de-aged approximately 25 years from the age of 70 at the time of filming to 45 for the 1995 setting. To do this, both Jackson and Gregg had tracking dots applied to their face during filming for which the VFX team could anchor the \"hand-crafted\" facial features that were composited primarily in [[Autodesk Flame]]. Lola's team included 40 primary compositors with another 15\u201320 junior compositors, and created approximately 500 different VFX shots, of which 385 made it in the final cut of film.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> This was the first time Lola de-aged an actor without using a body double, as it would take too long to re-film all of Fury's scenes with the double.<ref name=\"LolaNoDouble\" />\n\nTrixster did initial development on the look of Danver's Binary powers, and contributed the majority of visual effects for Goose the Cat, including movements that were impossible for real-life cats to act. ILM handled Goose's alien features, as well as much of the final battle in which they used Trixter's work on the Binary powers as well as inspiration from comic books and video games. ILM also did some work on the Supreme Intelligence's virtual environment, alongside Animal Logic, who took inspiration from the interior of the [[Louvre Abu Dhabi]] and the work they did with [[fractal]]s for ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'' (2017). These scenes were filmed in a white room without green or blue screen, so Animal Logic had to [[Rotoscoping|rotoscope]] the actors out of the footage and place them in the digital environment. To maintain the quality of the actors' hair during this process, Animal Logic created digital hair for Larson and Bening. Luma Pictures was primarily responsible for the train chase sequence, nicknamed the \"French Connection\" scene after [[The French Connection (film)|the 1971 film of the same name]]. They had to make the footage look like it was continuing along a single train line since the sequence was filmed in multiple locations around Los Angeles. Digital Domain worked on the Skrull transformation sequences, Rise created the exterior environment of Hala, and Framstore handled the battle sequence on Torfa. Rising Sun handled all of the Kree forearm holograms, the interior of the Project Pegasus hangar, and the exterior of the Quadjet. Scanline worked on effects for the aerial chases and the accident scene where Danvers gains her powers. Elastic created the end titles, and [[The Third Floor, Inc.]] provided [[previsualization]] and postvisualization work.<ref name=\"FXGuide2\" />\n\nThe film's mid-credits scene shows Captain Marvel meeting the Avengers, and was directed by [[Russo brothers|Anthony and Joe Russo]]. Boden described it as a lead-in to the Russo's ''Avengers: Endgame''.<ref name=\"CaptainMarvelMidCredits\" /> For ''Captain Marvel'', Marvel Studios modified their [[production logo]] to honor [[Stan Lee]], who died on November 12, 2018, by replacing the characters in the logo with Lee's MCU cameos. The logo is followed by a black screen reading \"Thank You Stan\". Feige said this was done because the film is Marvel's first since Lee died, and they wanted to start the film by acknowledging him with a celebration of his legacy rather than add a somber memorial to the end of the film.<ref name=\"LeeTribute\" />\n\n== Music ==\n{{Main|Captain Marvel (soundtrack)}}\n[[Pinar Toprak]] signed on to compose the film's score in June 2018, making her the first woman to score an MCU film.<ref name=\"Toprak\" /> Toprak began by creating the title character's theme, before developing themes for the Kree and the Skrulls, whom she tried to connect in order to \"find the universe\" for the film's scenes in space and Earth.<ref name=\"ToprakPremiere\" /> Toprak wanted Captain Marvel's theme to be recognizable from its first two notes.<ref name=\"ToprakPremiere\" /> In addition to Toprak's score, the film's soundtrack includes [[Alan Silvestri]]'s theme from ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012);<ref name=\"CBScore\" /> [[Michael Giacchino]]'s Marvel Studios Fanfare, which is played over the Marvel Studios logo and referenced during Stan Lee's cameo appearance;<ref name=\"GiacchinoFanfare\" /> and songs from the 1990s.<ref name=\"GreggEWMay2018\" />\n\nIn April 2019, Mark Salcido of the website ''Screen Geek'' alleged that Marvel and the film's directors had been unhappy with Toprak's work on the film even after she had responded to \"ample\" notes, and had replaced her as composer for the film with Giacchino.<ref name=\"GiacchinoRumour\" /> Giacchino responded to this report by confirming he was involved in the film, revealing that he had been asked to give feedback on Toprak's work while he was working with Marvel on the score for ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019). He thought Toprak had written a \"beautiful theme and an inspiring score\" for the film, and had helped her work on \"a few cues\" which he said was him supporting her as a fellow member of the Marvel \"family\". Giacchino made it clear that he \"did not write the score to ''Captain Marvel'' ... bottom line is [Toprak] is a fabulous composer and certainly doesn't need me\".<ref name=\"GiacchinoResponse\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\n[[File:Captain Marvel trailer at the National Air and Space Museum 3.jpg|thumb|left|Larson with airmen from the [[Air Force District of Washington]] and their families at a screening of the first ''Captain Marvel'' trailer at the National Air and Space Museum]]\nIn 2017, concept art from the film was shown at San Diego Comic-Con,<ref name=\"2017SDCC\" /> and a first look at Larson as Danvers was revealed at [[CineEurope]].<ref name=\"CineEurope\" /> Larson debuted the first trailer for the film that September at the [[National Air and Space Museum]] on ''[[Good Morning America]]''.<ref name=\"DeadlineFirstTrailer\" /> Petrana Radulovic of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' felt the trailer showed \"large-scale action and intergalactic mayhem that reaches for ''Infinity War''{{'}}s heights\",<ref name=\"PolygonFirstTrailer\" /> while Ben Kuchera, also of ''Polygon'', approved of opening the trailer with [[Blockbuster Video]] since its logo is identifiable to the audience. Kuchera also compared the \"sun-drenched\" Airforce pilot sequences to ''Top Gun''.<ref name=\"PolygonFirstTrailer2\" /> Devan Coogan of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called the trailer \"a powerful introduction to the MCU's first solo female hero\".<ref name=\"EWFirstTrailer\" /> Graeme McMillian of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' felt the prominent narration by Nick Fury \"grounds the trailer in something\u2014some{{em|one}}\u2014familiar for the Marvel faithful\", but said the changes to the character's origin story were \"a risky proposition\" to long-time fans of the character.<ref name=\"THRFirstTrailer\" /> Richard Newby, also of ''The Hollywood Reporter'', noted that the character's unfamiliarity to audiences was not presented as a joke in the trailer as with Marvel's ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' and ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' (2015), and commended Davis for its more grounded look than previous MCU films.<ref name=\"THRFirstTrailer2\" /> The trailer did receive some criticism, including that the plot presented was unclear, confusion as to why Danvers punches an elderly woman, and objections to Danvers not smiling much.<ref name=\"THRSecondTrailer\" /> The trailer was viewed 109&nbsp;million times in its first 24 hours, becoming the [[List of most-viewed online trailers in the first 24 hours|11th most viewed trailer in that time period]].<ref name=\"FirstTrailerViews\" />\n\nThe second trailer debuted on December 3, 2018, during halftime of the ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game between the [[Washington Redskins]] and the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].<ref name=\"SecondTrailerAndPoster\" /> McMillian felt the trailer too overtly responded to online criticisms of the first, including clarification that \"the elderly lady Carol punches was a Skrull\", more shots of her smiling, and \"additional emphasis on both explaining the plot and establishing Carol Danvers as a character\". McMillian compared the contents and structure of the two ''Captain Marvel'' trailers to those for ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011) and ''Captain America: The First Avenger''.<ref name=\"THRSecondTrailer\" /> Newby felt the second trailer \"offers increased action and a more in-depth look at the mythology surrounding\" Captain Marvel, but criticized it for not helping to introduce the film's supporting characters. He compared the trailer to a superhero version of [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[Starman (film)|Starman]]'' (1984), explaining, \"Explosions, space battles, and superpowers may bring in the crowds, but it's moments [of] humanity and introspection that will allow ''Captain Marvel'' to leave her mark and encourage audiences to care about the mystery surrounding who she is.\"<ref name=\"THRSecondTrailer2\" /> On December 8, Larson participated in a panel at [[Comic Con Experience|CCXP]] in Brazil, where she shared footage and an extended trailer from the film and presented an exclusive poster for the event.<ref name=\"CCXP\" /> By January 3, 2019, ''[[BoxOffice (magazine)|BoxOffice]]'' revealed their \"Trailer Impact\" metric service indicated approximately 66\u201370% of people surveyed who viewed the ''Captain Marvel'' trailer in the past two weeks expressed interest in seeing the film. In the two weeks it was measured by \"Trailer Impact\", it was number two for both, behind ''Avengers: Endgame'', and had some of the highest percentage of respondents express interest in seeing the film ever for the service. \"Trailer Impact\" usually includes films 10 weeks out from release, but ''BoxOffice'' decided to add ''Captain Marvel'' to the survey 12 weeks out.<ref name=\"TrailerImpactData\" />\n\nIn January 2019, the crowdfunding platform [[GoFundMe]] announced the #CaptainMarvelChallenge, a campaign to purchase tickets and refreshments for girls and chaperones at the Greater Los Angeles chapter of [[Girls, Inc.]] The campaign, inspired by the success of the #BlackPantherChallenge which raised more than $50,000 for children to watch ''Black Panther'', came after Brie Larson suggested on Twitter that there should be a similar campaign for ''Captain Marvel''.<ref name=\"CaptainMarvelChallenge\" /> For the film's press tour, Larson noted she would be \"pushing for representation across the board: my interviews, magazine covers, the clothes that I'm wearing\" as part of her support for inclusiveness and opposition to sexual harassment in Hollywood.<ref name=\"LarsonPressTourInclusion\" /> In February, a commercial for the film aired during the television broadcast of [[Super Bowl LIII]]. Bruce Fretts of ''[[The New York Times]]'' listed the commercial as one of the best advertisements to air during the telecast, stating, \"The commercial introduces a new catchphrase\u2014'higher, further, faster'\u2014and lives up to it with a lightning-quick montage that sets pulses racing.\"<ref name=\"NYTSuperBowl\" /> [[CBS]] charged $5.25&nbsp;million for each 30-second advertisement that aired during the game.<ref name=\"CNBCSuperBowl\" /> Also in February, [[Alaska Airlines]] unveiled a ''Captain Marvel''-themed [[Boeing 737-800]] jet, featuring the film's logo on the side and images of Goose the Cat on its wings.

the importance of it. She's such an incredibly kick-ass character and Kelly Sue DeConnick did a great run with her story arc recently. But here's the thing, if you were just going to do a straight adaptation of the comics, her origin story is very similar to Green Lantern. And obviously, that's not what we want to do. There's a lot of reinvention that needs to happen. And also, she's her own person and she's a great character. We have to be aware of what's happened in other Marvel film and makes sure that her particular storyline is unique and fun and also fits in within this world that's going on at the same time. It's a little bit of an interesting story gauntlet. It's been good to have a partner. It's been an incredible experience.

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the twenty-first film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film is written and directed by [[Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck]], with [[Geneva Robertson-Dworet]] also contributing to the screenplay. [[Brie Larson]] stars as Danvers, alongside [[Samuel L. Jackson]], [[Ben Mendelsohn]], [[Djimon Hounsou]], [[Lee Pace]], [[Lashana Lynch]], [[Gemma Chan]], [[Annette Bening]], [[Clark Gregg]], and [[Jude Law]]. Set in 1995, the story follows Danvers as she becomes [[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]] after Earth is caught in the center of a galactic conflict between two alien civilizations. \n\nDevelopment of the film began as early as May 2013. It was officially announced in October 2014 as Marvel Studios' first female-led superhero film. [[Nicole Perlman]] and [[Meg LeFauve]] were hired as a writing team the following April after submitting separate takes on the character. The story borrows elements from [[Roy Thomas]]'s 1971 \"[[Kree\u2013Skrull War]]\" comic book storyline. Larson was announced as Danvers at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con]], with Boden and Fleck hired to direct in April 2017. Robertson-Dworet soon took over scripting duties, with the remainder of the cast added by the start of filming. [[Location shooting]] began in January 2018, with [[principal photography]] beginning that March in California before concluding in Louisiana in July 2018. Jackson and Gregg\u2014who, among others, reprise their roles from previous MCU films\u2014were digitally [[De-aging in film|de-aged]] in [[post-production]] to reflect the film's 1990s setting.\n\n''Captain Marvel'' premiered in London on February 27, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on March 8. The film grossed over $1.1&nbsp;billion worldwide, making it the first female-led superhero film to pass the billion-dollar mark. It ranks as the [[2019 in film#Highest-grossing films|fifth-highest-grossing film of 2019]], and became the [[List of highest-grossing superhero films|<!--This is the '''peak''' position the film achieved (April 21\u201328, 2019), not the current. Please do NOT adjust!-->ninth-highest-grossing superhero film]] and [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing films|23rd<!--This is the PEAK POSITION the film achieved NOT the CURRENT. Please do NOT adjust!-->-highest-grossing film]] overall at the time. The film received praise for the performances of the cast, particularly that of Larson. A sequel is in development, with an expected 2022 release.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1995, on the [[Kree]] Empire's capital planet of Hala, [[Starforce]] member [[Carol Danvers|Vers]] suffers from amnesia and recurring nightmares involving an older woman. [[Yon-Rogg]], her mentor and commander, trains her to control her abilities while the [[Supreme Intelligence]], the artificial intelligence that rules the Kree, urges her to keep her emotions in check. <!--the onscreen caption when Vers goes up the steps to the Supreme Intelligence says only \"AI\" and no dialogue calls it organic-->\n\nDuring a mission to rescue an undercover operative infiltrating a group of [[Skrull]]s, alien shapeshifters with whom the Kree are at war, Vers is captured by Skrull commander [[Talos (comics)|Talos]]. A probe of Vers's memories leads them to Earth. Vers escapes and crash-lands in Los Angeles. Her presence attracts [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] and [[Phil Coulson]], whose investigation is interrupted by a Skrull attack. In the ensuing chase, Vers recovers a crystal containing her extracted memories while Fury kills a Skrull impersonating Coulson. Talos, disguised as Fury's boss Keller, orders Fury to work with Vers and keep tabs on her.\n\nUsing her extracted memories, Vers and Fury go to the [[Project Pegasus]] installation at a [[U.S. Air Force]] base. They discover Vers was a pilot presumed to have died in 1989 while testing an experimental light-speed engine designed by Dr. [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Wendy Lawson]], whom Vers recognizes as the woman from her nightmares. After Fury informs S.H.I.E.L.D. of their location, a team led by Talos disguised as Keller arrives. Fury discovers Talos's ruse and helps Vers escape in a cargo jet<!--Term \"quadjet\" is never used in the film. We had RfC debate over this over the term \"Mjolnir\" in Iron Man 2 and consensus is that it is OR to use terms the manifest content of the movie itself does not make--> with Lawson's stowaway cat Goose. They fly to [[Louisiana]] to meet former pilot Maria Rambeau, the last person to see Vers and Lawson alive.\n\nRambeau and her daughter [[Monica Rambeau|Monica]] reveal that Vers is Carol Danvers, who was once like family to them. Talos, arriving unarmed, explains that the Skrulls are refugees searching for a new home and that Lawson was Mar-Vell, a renegade Kree scientist helping them. Talos plays a recovered recording from Lawson's jet, prompting Danvers to remember the crash: Lawson was killed by Yon-Rogg to prevent her from destroying the engine before the Kree could recover it. Destroying the engine herself, Danvers absorbed the energy from the ensuing explosion, gaining powers but losing her memory.\n\nDanvers, Talos, Fury, and Rambeau locate Lawson's cloaked laboratory orbiting Earth, where Lawson hid several Skrulls, including Talos's family, and the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]], the power source of Lawson's engine. There, Danvers is captured by Starforce and interfaces with the Supreme Intelligence. During their conversation, Danvers removes the Kree implant that was suppressing her powers, allowing her to reach her full potential. In the subsequent battle, Fury retrieves Goose, who is revealed to be an alien [[Flerken]]. Goose swallows the Tesseract and scratches Fury, blinding his left eye. Danvers destroys a Kree bomber, forcing Kree officer [[Ronan the Accuser]] and his squadron to retreat, before overpowering Yon-Rogg on Earth and sending him back to Hala with a warning to the Supreme Intelligence.\n\nDanvers departs to help the Skrulls find a new homeworld, leaving Fury a modified [[pager]] to contact her in an emergency. Meanwhile, Fury drafts an initiative to locate heroes like Danvers, naming it after her Air Force [[Aviator call sign|call sign]], \"Avenger\". In a [[mid-credits scene]], set in 2018, the activated pager{{refn|name=CaptainMarvel1|group=N|As depicted in the 2018 film ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''.<ref name=\"CaptainMarvel\" />}} is being monitored by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] when Danvers appears.{{refn|name=CaptainMarvel2|group=N|This scene was directed by ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' directors [[Anthony and Joe Russo]] as a lead-in to that film.<ref name=\"CaptainMarvelMidCredits\" />}} In a post-credits scene, Goose climbs onto Fury's desk and regurgitates the Tesseract.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Order per billing block -->\n{{multiple image\n| align             = right\n| direction         = vertical\n| width             = 220\n| image1            = Captain Marvel trailer at the National Air and Space Museum 2.jpg\n| alt1              = \n| image2            = Samuel L.

Mendelsohn uses an American accent inspired by former [[United States Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] for Keller, and his native Australian accent for Talos; the latter was chosen, after a \"lengthy discussion\", due to what Mendelsohn called \"earthy correctness\". The makeup and prosthetics necessary to portray Talos took \"a couple of hours\" to apply.<ref name=\"EWMendelsohn\" /> Executive producer Johnathan Schwartz added that \"it's sort of fun to show off both the Skrull's powers and Ben's range as an actor\" with the character.<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" /> Talos also takes on a surfer girl form portrayed by Emily Ozrey and Abigaille Ozrey, and a Kree soldier disguise played by [[Duane Henry]].<ref name=\"PressKit\" />\n* [[Djimon Hounsou]] as [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]]: <br />A Kree swordsman and second-in-command of Starforce.<ref name=\"THRFilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"MeetStarforceCharacters\" /> Hounsou explained that Korath was \"at his infancy\" in the film compared to his appearance in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014), but was \"still a humorless machine\".<ref name=\"EWMagCoverStory\" />\n* [[Lee Pace]] as [[Ronan the Accuser]]: <br />A high-ranking Kree official.<ref name=\"THRFilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"/FilmEWPhotos\" /> Compared to his appearance in ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', Ronan is not yet a \"radical zealot\", with his role in the Kree military intersecting with Starforce \"in an interesting way\".<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" />\n* [[Lashana Lynch]] as Maria Rambeau: <br />One of Danvers' oldest friends and a fellow Air Force pilot who goes by the call sign \"Photon\".

In particular, she met with pilots who are also mothers. Lynch was excited to portray a character the audience would be proud of and could relate to, especially mothers and members of the black community, helping to continue \"a real through-line\" for African-American characters in the MCU after ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' (2018).<ref name=\"EWLynch\" />\n* [[Gemma Chan]] as [[Doctor Minerva|Minn-Erva]]: <br />A Kree sniper and member of Starforce.<ref name=\"EWMagCoverStory\" /><ref name=\"EWLaw\" /> Chan explained that Minn-Erva was \"the star of Starforce\" before Danvers joined the team and is \"slightly threatened by someone else who has come in and is also very talented\".<ref name=\"EWMagCoverStory\" />\n* [[Annette Bening]] as the [[Supreme Intelligence]] and [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Mar-Vell / Dr. Wendy Lawson]]: <br />The Supreme Intelligence is an [[artificial intelligence]] that is the collective embodiment of the greatest minds of the Kree people, and the ruler of the Kree Empire.<ref name=\"Bening\" /><ref name=\"BeningSupremeIntelligence\" /> It appears in different forms to each person,<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" /> specifically to Vers as rebel Kree scientist Mar-Vell, who had disguised herself on Earth as Danvers' boss Dr. Wendy Lawson.<ref name=\"BeningLawson\" /> Mar-Vell was originally written as a male love interest to Danvers as in the comics, but after struggling to cast the character co-director [[Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck|Anna Boden]] suggested that they cast a woman instead, and tie her into the Supreme Intelligence storyline by combining those characters. Boden said Bening was \"regal\" as the Supreme Intelligence, and \"casual and cool and laid back\" as Lawson.<ref name=\"BodenBeningMar2019\" /> Feige said changing Mar-Vell's gender was important to Danvers' development in the film, giving her a female mentor.<ref name=\"FeigeBeningMar2019\" />\n* [[Clark Gregg]] as [[Phil Coulson]]: <br />A rookie agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. who works closely with Fury.<ref name=\"EWGreggSept2018\" /> Gregg said the film would be \"the earliest we will have seen [Coulson in the MCU], so when he says, 'Mr. Stark, this isn't my first rodeo' in ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008), this is maybe the rodeo he's talking about.\"<ref name=\"GreggEWMay2018\" /> He had to work to portray Coulson \"a little less crusty and jaded\" as he is in the present of the MCU.<ref name=\"EWGreggSept2018\" /> Though Coulson encountered the Kree in the MCU television series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', Schwartz noted that ''Captain Marvel'' would not need to worry about that since it is a prequel where Kree is not even \"part of his vocabulary yet\".<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitSchwartzPg2\" /> Like Jackson, Gregg was digitally de-aged by 25 years.<ref name=\"Feige/FilmJul2018\" />\n* [[Jude Law]] as [[Yon-Rogg]]: <br />The commander of Starforce and Danvers' mentor, who trains her to use her new powers.<ref name=\"PressKit\" /><ref name=\"FinalBTSConfirmation\" /> Law said that his character is \"driven by a belief in the divine leadership of the Kree people.

Producer Jeremy Latcham elaborated that \"getting the character right first is going to lead the charge\".<ref name=\"FeigeSept2015\" /> In October 2015, Marvel changed the release date again, this time moving it to March 8, 2019, due to ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'' (2018).<ref name=\"Phase3Update\" />\n\nFeige stated in April 2016 that a director would be announced within a few months and that the first cast members would be announced in mid-2016. He also mentioned that the film would be about Carol Danvers becoming Captain Marvel.<ref name=\"FeigeApr2016\" /> The next month, indie filmmaker [[Emily Carmichael (filmmaker)|Emily Carmichael]]'s name surfaced as a possible contender to direct the film,<ref name=\"Carmichael\" /> and by June, [[Brie Larson]] emerged as the frontrunner to play Captain Marvel.<ref name=\"Larson2\" /> Larson's casting was confirmed at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con]].<ref name=\"LarsonConfirm\" /> She was set to earn $5&nbsp;million for the film.<ref name=\"LarsonPay\" /> Larson was initially hesitant to accept the role, but \"couldn't deny the fact that this movie is everything I care about, everything that's progressive and important and meaningful, and a symbol I wished I would've had growing up.\"<ref name=\"LarsonVanityFair\" /> She was able to bring to the part \"some of those [deep emotional] things\" she had used in previous, more \"dramatic roles\". Larson felt this would differentiate ''Captain Marvel'' from other superhero films.<ref name=\"EWCoverLarson\" /> Also at Comic-Con, Feige said the search for a director had narrowed to ten candidates, and hoped to announce the final choice in the coming months.<ref name=\"FeigeSDCC2016\" />\n\nPerlman revealed in August that the character's origin story had been changed for the film due to similarities with the [[DC Comics]] character [[Green Lantern]],<ref name=\"PerlmanAug2016\" /> with Feige explaining that the new story is centered on Danvers finding her limitations and vulnerabilities. He added that Danvers is the most powerful character in the MCU, and would become a very important in the franchise.<ref name=\"FeigeOct2016\" /> Producer Nate Moore said the film avoids the traditional structure of many MCU origin stories, which he described as a character having a problem before gaining \"powers at the end of the first act, and the end of the second act they learn about the powers, the third act they probably fight a villain who has a function of the same powers\";<ref name=\"MooreMay2018\" /> instead, Danvers starts the film having already gained her powers.<ref name=\"EWCover\" />\n\nIn October 2016, Feige admitted that the announcement for a director was taking longer than he previously expected, and explained that the studio was now waiting for more of the film's story to be defined in the script so they could then talk to potential directors about it. Once again talking about hiring a female filmmaker to direct the film, Feige said that he did not think it would be a requirement to make a \"great version\" of the film, but it was something that Marvel felt was important to consider, even if that female filmmaker does not know a lot about the comics, as \"they just have to fall in love with it once they are presented with it. It's amazing to see all of the filmmakers read through [the source material] and know, 'Oh, a female's writing it now{{'\"}}, speaking in particular to [[Kelly Sue DeConnick]]'s run in the comics.<ref name=\"FeigeOct2016\" /> Feige expected a director to be announced by the end of 2016;<ref name=\"FeigeDirectorEnd2016\" /> however, Perlman and LeFauve turned in a script treatment around December, pushing additional meetings with director candidates into early 2017.<ref name=\"ScriptDirectorUpdate\" />\n\nIn February 2017, Perlman stated that despite her and LeFauve being hired almost a year previously, the duo had only recently gotten their \"marching orders\" for the script, stating one of the reasons for the delay was figuring out where the film would fit within the MCU. Perlman also discussed the character's femininity, feeling that it was important to make sure she is not \"somebody who is a hero in spite of her femininity ... being a woman is part of [her] strength\". The writers were also considerate of tropes that could be diminishing to a female character but not for male characters, such as things they would not have been concerned writing for [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Iron Man]] but did not play the same way for Captain Marvel.<ref name=\"PerlmanPodcast\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\n{{quote box|width=33%|quote=This is not a superhero who's perfect or otherworldly. ...

Feige felt the film had to focus on the complexity and relatability of Carol Danvers' character without being bogged down by the villains and the special effects, and thought that Boden and Fleck could provide this character focus.<ref name=\"FeigeVultureApr2017\" /> Filming was scheduled to begin in January 2018, at [[Pinewood Studios#Pinewood Atlanta|Pinewood Atlanta Studios]] in [[Fayette County, Georgia]],<ref name=\"FilmingLocation\" /> but Feige said he did not expect it to begin until February.<ref name=\"FebFilmingStart\" />\n\nBy July 2017, [[Samuel L. Jackson]] was set to appear in the film, reprising his role as [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]].<ref name=\"Jackson\" /> Larson, who worked with Jackson on ''[[Kong: Skull Island]]'' (2017), pushed for Fury's presence in the film.<ref name=\"LarsonFury\" /> At the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con, Feige revealed that the film would take place in the 1990s and that the [[Skrulls]] would be the film's villains, allowing elements from the \"[[Kree\u2013Skrull War]]\" (1971) comic book storyline to be used.<ref name=\"2017SDCC\" /><ref name=\"Kree\u2013Skrull War\" /> By setting the film in the 1990s, Feige noted that Danvers would \"be the singular hero\" while still giving her a definitive placing in the MCU timeline.<ref name=\"FeigeMar2018\" /> Executive producer Jonathan Schwartz said setting the film in the 1990s was an idea from early in the development process, and gave the character a special place and significance within the MCU. It also allowed the film to make connections to plot details from past MCU films that are set later in the timeline.<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" /> Regarding the elements from the \"Kree\u2013Skrull War\" used for the film, Schwartz said some paranoia elements would be featured but would not be related to the Anti-Superhero Act as in the comics. He added that the Kree-Skrull conflict is would mostly be a \"backdrop and mythological underpinning\" for the film.<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitSchwartzPg2\" /> In response to the Comic-Con announcements, Graeme McMillan of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' compared the film to ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' (2011) and the [[DC Extended Universe]] film ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' (2017), as they were also set decades before present day. By setting the film in the 1990s, McMillan felt it would create the question of \"what happened to Captain Marvel to take her off the playing field ahead of the Marvel movies that we've seen to date?\".<ref name=\"THRComparison\" />\n\n[[File:Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck at the Pentagon.jpg|thumb|left|Directors Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden speaking at [[The Pentagon]] in March 2019]]\nAlso in July, the [[California Film Commission]] awarded a $20.7{{nbsp}}million tax credit to the production,<ref name=\"CaliforniaTaxCredit\" /> going towards the first $100{{nbsp}}million spent on qualified in-state expenditures,<ref name=\"CaliforniaTaxCredit2\" /> making California the main filming location for ''Captain Marvel''. D'Esposito was excited about this, given Marvel Studios' headquarters and post-production facilities are also in the state, allowing them to streamline the production process for this film and others.<ref name=\"CaliforniaTaxCredit\" /> Awarding of the tax credit was dependent on filming beginning within 180 days.<ref name=\"CaliforniaTaxCreditPDF\" /> Marvel planned to spend $118.6&nbsp;million filming in the state, for a net of $97.8&nbsp;million after the tax credit was applied.<ref name=\"CFCBudget\" /> Schwartz said one of the reasons Los Angeles was chosen for filming was because \"not a lot of big movies shoot in LA anymore, so it weirdly feels like fresh territory for a movie like this\".<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitSchwartzPg3\" />\n\n[[Geneva Robertson-Dworet]] was hired by mid-August to take over the scripting duties for ''Captain Marvel'' after LeFauve left the project to co-direct ''[[Gigantic (2020 film)|Gigantic]]'' for [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney Animation]].<ref name=\"Robertson-Dworet\" /> Perlman also left the project, but stated that the story she and LeFauve had worked on in earlier drafts would be retained in the final screenplay.<ref name=\"PerlmanAugust2017\" /> Robertson-Dworet described the film as an action-comedy, and likened her script to an initial one she wrote for ''[[Tomb Raider (film)|Tomb Raider]]'' (2018) before that film took a more dramatic tone. She added that it was important to the entire creative team to keep the comedic elements of the film and the sassiness of Danvers' character. Robertson-Dworet also credited Boden for helping to shape Danvers' voice in the film and the desire \"to carve our own path and make sure we weren't retreading the same territory [after the release of ''Wonder Woman''], and showing all facets of what women are capable of\".<ref name=\"RobertsonDworetEWMar2018\" /> Feige added that ''Captain Marvel'' would have action scenes that would pay homage to 1990s action films, including ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991), since the 1990s action genre was one Marvel Studios had yet to explore. He also stated much of the film would take place in outer space.<ref name=\"FeigeMar2018\" /> ''[[RoboCop]]'' (1987), ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (1971), and ''[[The Conversation]]'' (1974) also served as influences on ''Captain Marvel'' for Boden and Fleck. Speaking specifically to ''RoboCop'', the directors were drawn to \"this idea of a character who's finding himself and finding his past\" from that film and how it could connect to the story they were telling in ''Captain Marvel''.<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitDirectors\" /> DeConnick and quantum physicist Spyridon Michalakis, of the Institute for Quantum Information and Matter at the [[California Institute of Technology]], consulted on the film.<ref name=\"ColliderDec2018\" /><ref name=\"ScienceConsultant\" />\n\nBy October, filming was slated to begin in March 2018. Feige said the film would play a significant role in setting up ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' which was scheduled for release after ''Captain Marvel''.<ref name=\"MarFilmingStart\" /> [[Ben Mendelsohn]] entered negotiations to join the film as the main villain,<ref name=\"Mendelsohn\" /> having previously worked with Boden and Fleck on their film ''[[Mississippi Grind]]'' (2015). They had him in mind for the ''Captain Marvel'' villain when they first began working on this film's story, and Mendelsohn agreed to play the role shortly after discussing the film with the directors.<ref name=\"Mendelsohn2\" /> By November, [[Jude Law]] was in negotiations to join the film, which at the time was reported to be the role of [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Walter Lawson / Mar-Vell]].<ref name=\"Law\" /> In January 2018, [[DeWanda Wise]] was cast as Maria Rambeau,<ref name=\"EWLynch\" /><ref name=\"Wise\" /> and Mendelsohn and Law were confirmed to have been cast.<ref name=\"Wise\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[File:Captain Marvel filming at Edwards AFB.jpg|thumb|Filming of ''Captain Marvel'' at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] in April 2018]]\n[[Location shooting]] occurred at the end of January 2018.<ref name=\"JanLocationShooting\" /><ref name=\"LocationShooting\" /> Set photos taken at that time showed Larson in a green and black uniform instead of the character's familiar red and blue suit. Feige responded by saying that Marvel accepts the risk of set photos being leaked as a consequence of location shooting, and felt that \"most people are savvy enough to know they're looking at a behind-the-scenes photo, completely out of context\". He added that a large number of scenes in the film would be shot on location.<ref name=\"LocationShooting\" />\n\nA month later, [[Gemma Chan]] joined the cast as [[Doctor Minerva|Minn-Erva]].<ref name=\"Chan\" /> In mid-March, Wise withdrew from the film due to a scheduling conflict with her television series ''[[She's Gotta Have It (TV series)|She's Gotta Have It]]''.<ref name=\"NoWise\" /> [[Lashana Lynch]] entered into negotiations to replace Wise the next day,<ref name=\"Lynch\" /> and was confirmed for the role by the end of the month. At that time, [[Djimon Hounsou]], [[Lee Pace]], and [[Clark Gregg]] were set to reprise their respective roles of [[Korath the Pursuer|Korath]], [[Ronan the Accuser]], and [[Phil Coulson]] from earlier MCU films; as those characters were all killed in their previous appearances, Richard Newby of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' described the film as a unique opportunity to \"strengthen the presence of [the characters] who may not have lived up to their potential\".<ref name=\"THRMar2018\" /> [[Algenis Perez Soto]], [[Rune Temte]], and [[Mckenna Grace]] were also cast.<ref name=\"FullCastAnnouncement\" /><ref name=\"THRFilmingStart\" /> Marvel revealed that Boden, Fleck, and the writing team of [[Liz Flahive]] and [[Carly Mensch]] had worked on the screenplay in addition to LeFauve, Perlman, and Robertson-Dworet.<ref name=\"FullCastAnnouncement\" /> Bek Smith, who previously worked in Marvel's screenwriter program, performed uncredited production rewrites.<ref name=\"SmithRewrites\" />\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on March 19 in Los Angeles,<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> at Sony Studios under the [[working title]] ''Open World''.<ref name=\"SonyStudios\" /><ref name=\"LouisianaBudget\" /> Schwartz stated that ''Open World'' was chosen as a working title because it likened the film to an [[open world]] video game that could go in many directions, which is how the production felt about ''Captain Marvel''{{'}}s story at the time.<ref name=\"ColliderSetVisit28Things\" /> A 1986 carnival scene was filmed later that week at the [[Jim Hall (racing driver)|Jim Hall Racing Club]] in [[Oxnard, California]].<ref name=\"OxnardFilming\" /> Filming of ''Captain Marvel'' in Los Angeles, along with other big-budget films that took advantage of California's improved tax credit program, helped raise on-location feature film production in the area by 11.7% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, the first such double-figure increase since the fourth quarter of 2015.<ref name=\"FilmingIncrease\" /> Filming at [[Shaver Lake]] outside [[Fresno, California]] was set to take place in April<ref name=\"ShaverLake\" /> but was pushed back to mid-May.<ref name=\"ShaverLake2\" /><ref name=\"ShaverLake3\" /> In late April, Feige stated that almost half of filming was completed.<ref name=\"FeigeApr2018\" /> The following month, [[Annette Bening]] joined the cast in an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"Bening\" /> Additional location shooting in and around the Los Angeles area included [[Simi Valley, California|Simi Valley]], [[Edwards Air Force Base]], and [[Lucerne Valley, California|Lucerne Valley]].<ref name=\"/FilmSetVisitSchwartzPg5\" /> In late June, production moved to [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]] and [[New Orleans]] for two weeks.<ref name=\"FullCastAnnouncement\" /><ref name=\"CaliforniaFilmingEnd\" /> A realistic cat puppet was used on set as Larson is allergic to cats.<ref name=\"EWGoose\" /> Scenes featuring the interior of the Quadjet were filmed on the set used to depict the interior of Quinjets on the MCU television series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''<ref name=\"SharedSet\"/> Filming concluded on July 6.<ref name=\"FilmingEnd\" />\n\nCinematographer [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]] shot primarily on large-format [[Arri Alexa]] 65 cameras, liking how the camera rendered the film's costumes.<ref name=\"ICG\" /> Davis, who previously served as director of photography for ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', and ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'' (2016),<ref name=\"FullCastAnnouncement\" /> noted that there was a \"point of departure\" in the visuals of ''Captain Marvel'' coming from its 1990s setting.<ref name=\"Yahoo!Davis\" /> To achieve the 1990s aesthetic, Davis first attempted to utilize post-production techniques to convey a period look, but found that it just softened the image. He then tried using vintage [[Cooke Optics|Cooke]] Panchro and [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] K-35 lenses, but they were not compatible with the large-format of the Arri Alexa camera system.<ref name=\"VarietyDavis\" /> Davis ultimately enlisted Dan Sasaki of [[Panavision]] to make new lenses for the period scenes that could work with the cameras. Davis initially intended not to use these lenses for scenes set in space to differentiate them, but found himself using the lenses for some close-ups set in space because he liked the way they looked.<ref name=\"ICG\" />\n\n=== Post-production === \nAdditional photography was confirmed to have begun via set photos in late November 2018.<ref name=\"AdditionalPhotography\" /> With the release of the theatrical poster in early December, Marvel revealed that the writing team of Joe Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse had worked on the film's story, while [[Jac Schaeffer]] had contributed to the screenplay.<ref name=\"SecondTrailerAndPoster\" /> Schaeffer had previously been hired by Marvel to write ''[[Black Widow (2020 film)|Black Widow]]'' (2020).<ref name=\"SchaefferBW\" /> Bening's and Law's roles were officially confirmed in February 2019 as the [[Supreme Intelligence]] and [[Yon-Rogg]], respectively.<ref name=\"BeningSupremeIntelligence\" /><ref name=\"FinalBTSConfirmation\" />\n\nThe film was edited by [[Elliot Graham]] and [[Debbie Berman]], marking Berman's third time co-editing an MCU film after ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' and ''Black Panther''.<ref name=\"BermanBI\" /> ''Captain Marvel'' was edited using [[Avid Media Composer]] software in the [[Avid DNxHD]] codec on [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] computers.<ref name=\"BermanFrame\" /> Berman first became involved with the film when she was working on ''Homecoming'' and Boden and Fleck were hired, and was hired herself for ''Captain Marvel'' the first week she was working on ''Black Panther''.<ref name=\"BermanBI\" /> In addition to Graham and Berman, the editing team was made up of first assistants Jessica Baclesse and Kimberly Boritz, second assistants Basuki Juwono and Christos Voutsinas, and assistant editor Joe Galdo, among others.

''One Eight Seven'' (1997) was used as a primary reference to [[De-aging in film|de-age]] Jackson in ''Captain Marvel'', which is set in 1995.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />]]\nVisual effects for the film were created by [[Animal Logic]], Cantina Creative, [[Digital Domain]], [[Framestore]], [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), Lola VFX, [[Luma Pictures]], Rise, [[Rising Sun Pictures]], [[Scanline VFX]], Trixter, and Elastic,<ref name=\"VFXCompanies\" /> with Lola VFX working on the de-aging of Jackson and Gregg.<ref name=\"LolaVFX\" /> Lola looked at several of Jackson's films, including ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' (1994), ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'' (1995), ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993), ''[[Loaded Weapon 1]]'' (1993), and ''[[One Eight Seven]]'' (1997), as a reference for his de-aging. However, some of these films were disqualified due to circumstances around the character Jackson was playing; ''Pulp Fiction'' because of the character's wig and facial hair, and ''Jurassic Park'' because the character was made to appear older in that film. Lola VFX supervisor Trent Claus said the final look was based partly on ''Die Hard'' and ''Loaded Weapon 1'', but mostly on ''One Eight Seven'' which he described as the \"hero movie\". Jackson was de-aged approximately 25 years from the age of 70 at the time of filming to 45 for the 1995 setting. To do this, both Jackson and Gregg had tracking dots applied to their face during filming for which the VFX team could anchor the \"hand-crafted\" facial features that were composited primarily in [[Autodesk Flame]]. Lola's team included 40 primary compositors with another 15\u201320 junior compositors, and created approximately 500 different VFX shots, of which 385 made it in the final cut of film.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> This was the first time Lola de-aged an actor without using a body double, as it would take too long to re-film all of Fury's scenes with the double.<ref name=\"LolaNoDouble\" />\n\nTrixster did initial development on the look of Danver's Binary powers, and contributed the majority of visual effects for Goose the Cat, including movements that were impossible for real-life cats to act. ILM handled Goose's alien features, as well as much of the final battle in which they used Trixter's work on the Binary powers as well as inspiration from comic books and video games. ILM also did some work on the Supreme Intelligence's virtual environment, alongside Animal Logic, who took inspiration from the interior of the [[Louvre Abu Dhabi]] and the work they did with [[fractal]]s for ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'' (2017). These scenes were filmed in a white room without green or blue screen, so Animal Logic had to [[Rotoscoping|rotoscope]] the actors out of the footage and place them in the digital environment. To maintain the quality of the actors' hair during this process, Animal Logic created digital hair for Larson and Bening. Luma Pictures was primarily responsible for the train chase sequence, nicknamed the \"French Connection\" scene after [[The French Connection (film)|the 1971 film of the same name]]. They had to make the footage look like it was continuing along a single train line since the sequence was filmed in multiple locations around Los Angeles. Digital Domain worked on the Skrull transformation sequences, Rise created the exterior environment of Hala, and Framstore handled the battle sequence on Torfa. Rising Sun handled all of the Kree forearm holograms, the interior of the Project Pegasus hangar, and the exterior of the Quadjet. Scanline worked on effects for the aerial chases and the accident scene where Danvers gains her powers. Elastic created the end titles, and [[The Third Floor, Inc.]] provided [[previsualization]] and postvisualization work.<ref name=\"FXGuide2\" />\n\nThe film's mid-credits scene shows Captain Marvel meeting the Avengers, and was directed by [[Russo brothers|Anthony and Joe Russo]]. Boden described it as a lead-in to the Russo's ''Avengers: Endgame''.<ref name=\"CaptainMarvelMidCredits\" /> For ''Captain Marvel'', Marvel Studios modified their [[production logo]] to honor [[Stan Lee]], who died on November 12, 2018, by replacing the characters in the logo with Lee's MCU cameos. The logo is followed by a black screen reading \"Thank You Stan\". Feige said this was done because the film is Marvel's first since Lee died, and they wanted to start the film by acknowledging him with a celebration of his legacy rather than add a somber memorial to the end of the film.<ref name=\"LeeTribute\" />\n\n== Music ==\n{{Main|Captain Marvel (soundtrack)}}\n[[Pinar Toprak]] signed on to compose the film's score in June 2018, making her the first woman to score an MCU film.<ref name=\"Toprak\" /> Toprak began by creating the title character's theme, before developing themes for the Kree and the Skrulls, whom she tried to connect in order to \"find the universe\" for the film's scenes in space and Earth.<ref name=\"ToprakPremiere\" /> Toprak wanted Captain Marvel's theme to be recognizable from its first two notes.<ref name=\"ToprakPremiere\" /> In addition to Toprak's score, the film's soundtrack includes [[Alan Silvestri]]'s theme from ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012);<ref name=\"CBScore\" /> [[Michael Giacchino]]'s Marvel Studios Fanfare, which is played over the Marvel Studios logo and referenced during Stan Lee's cameo appearance;<ref name=\"GiacchinoFanfare\" /> and songs from the 1990s.<ref name=\"GreggEWMay2018\" />\n\nIn April 2019, Mark Salcido of the website ''Screen Geek'' alleged that Marvel and the film's directors had been unhappy with Toprak's work on the film even after she had responded to \"ample\" notes, and had replaced her as composer for the film with Giacchino.<ref name=\"GiacchinoRumour\" /> Giacchino responded to this report by confirming he was involved in the film, revealing that he had been asked to give feedback on Toprak's work while he was working with Marvel on the score for ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019). He thought Toprak had written a \"beautiful theme and an inspiring score\" for the film, and had helped her work on \"a few cues\" which he said was him supporting her as a fellow member of the Marvel \"family\". Giacchino made it clear that he \"did not write the score to ''Captain Marvel'' ... bottom line is [Toprak] is a fabulous composer and certainly doesn't need me\".<ref name=\"GiacchinoResponse\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\n[[File:Captain Marvel trailer at the National Air and Space Museum 3.jpg|thumb|left|Larson with airmen from the [[Air Force District of Washington]] and their families at a screening of the first ''Captain Marvel'' trailer at the National Air and Space Museum]]\nIn 2017, concept art from the film was shown at San Diego Comic-Con,<ref name=\"2017SDCC\" /> and a first look at Larson as Danvers was revealed at [[CineEurope]].<ref name=\"CineEurope\" /> Larson debuted the first trailer for the film that September at the [[National Air and Space Museum]] on ''[[Good Morning America]]''.<ref name=\"DeadlineFirstTrailer\" /> Petrana Radulovic of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' felt the trailer showed \"large-scale action and intergalactic mayhem that reaches for ''Infinity War''{{'}}s heights\",<ref name=\"PolygonFirstTrailer\" /> while Ben Kuchera, also of ''Polygon'', approved of opening the trailer with [[Blockbuster Video]] since its logo is identifiable to the audience. Kuchera also compared the \"sun-drenched\" Airforce pilot sequences to ''Top Gun''.<ref name=\"PolygonFirstTrailer2\" /> Devan Coogan of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called the trailer \"a powerful introduction to the MCU's first solo female hero\".<ref name=\"EWFirstTrailer\" /> Graeme McMillian of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' felt the prominent narration by Nick Fury \"grounds the trailer in something\u2014some{{em|one}}\u2014familiar for the Marvel faithful\", but said the changes to the character's origin story were \"a risky proposition\" to long-time fans of the character.<ref name=\"THRFirstTrailer\" /> Richard Newby, also of ''The Hollywood Reporter'', noted that the character's unfamiliarity to audiences was not presented as a joke in the trailer as with Marvel's ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' and ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' (2015), and commended Davis for its more grounded look than previous MCU films.<ref name=\"THRFirstTrailer2\" /> The trailer did receive some criticism, including that the plot presented was unclear, confusion as to why Danvers punches an elderly woman, and objections to Danvers not smiling much.<ref name=\"THRSecondTrailer\" /> The trailer was viewed 109&nbsp;million times in its first 24 hours, becoming the [[List of most-viewed online trailers in the first 24 hours|11th most viewed trailer in that time period]].<ref name=\"FirstTrailerViews\" />\n\nThe second trailer debuted on December 3, 2018, during halftime of the ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game between the [[Washington Redskins]] and the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].<ref name=\"SecondTrailerAndPoster\" /> McMillian felt the trailer too overtly responded to online criticisms of the first, including clarification that \"the elderly lady Carol punches was a Skrull\", more shots of her smiling, and \"additional emphasis on both explaining the plot and establishing Carol Danvers as a character\". McMillian compared the contents and structure of the two ''Captain Marvel'' trailers to those for ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011) and ''Captain America: The First Avenger''.<ref name=\"THRSecondTrailer\" /> Newby felt the second trailer \"offers increased action and a more in-depth look at the mythology surrounding\" Captain Marvel, but criticized it for not helping to introduce the film's supporting characters. He compared the trailer to a superhero version of [[John Carpenter]]'s ''[[Starman (film)|Starman]]'' (1984), explaining, \"Explosions, space battles, and superpowers may bring in the crowds, but it's moments [of] humanity and introspection that will allow ''Captain Marvel'' to leave her mark and encourage audiences to care about the mystery surrounding who she is.\"<ref name=\"THRSecondTrailer2\" /> On December 8, Larson participated in a panel at [[Comic Con Experience|CCXP]] in Brazil, where she shared footage and an extended trailer from the film and presented an exclusive poster for the event.<ref name=\"CCXP\" /> By January 3, 2019, ''[[BoxOffice (magazine)|BoxOffice]]'' revealed their \"Trailer Impact\" metric service indicated approximately 66\u201370% of people surveyed who viewed the ''Captain Marvel'' trailer in the past two weeks expressed interest in seeing the film. In the two weeks it was measured by \"Trailer Impact\", it was number two for both, behind ''Avengers: Endgame'', and had some of the highest percentage of respondents express interest in seeing the film ever for the service. \"Trailer Impact\" usually includes films 10 weeks out from release, but ''BoxOffice'' decided to add ''Captain Marvel'' to the survey 12 weeks out.<ref name=\"TrailerImpactData\" />\n\nIn January 2019, the crowdfunding platform [[GoFundMe]] announced the #CaptainMarvelChallenge, a campaign to purchase tickets and refreshments for girls and chaperones at the Greater Los Angeles chapter of [[Girls, Inc.]] The campaign, inspired by the success of the #BlackPantherChallenge which raised more than $50,000 for children to watch ''Black Panther'', came after Brie Larson suggested on Twitter that there should be a similar campaign for ''Captain Marvel''.<ref name=\"CaptainMarvelChallenge\" /> For the film's press tour, Larson noted she would be \"pushing for representation across the board: my interviews, magazine covers, the clothes that I'm wearing\" as part of her support for inclusiveness and opposition to sexual harassment in Hollywood.<ref name=\"LarsonPressTourInclusion\" /> In February, a commercial for the film aired during the television broadcast of [[Super Bowl LIII]]. Bruce Fretts of ''[[The New York Times]]'' listed the commercial as one of the best advertisements to air during the telecast, stating, \"The commercial introduces a new catchphrase\u2014'higher, further, faster'\u2014and lives up to it with a lightning-quick montage that sets pulses racing.\"<ref name=\"NYTSuperBowl\" /> [[CBS]] charged $5.25&nbsp;million for each 30-second advertisement that aired during the game.<ref name=\"CNBCSuperBowl\" /> Also in February, [[Alaska Airlines]] unveiled a ''Captain Marvel''-themed [[Boeing 737-800]] jet, featuring the film's logo on the side and images of Goose the Cat on its wings.

the importance of it. She's such an incredibly kick-ass character and Kelly Sue DeConnick did a great run with her story arc recently. But here's the thing, if you were just going to do a straight adaptation of the comics, her origin story is very similar to Green Lantern. And obviously, that's not what we want to do. There's a lot of reinvention that needs to happen. And also, she's her own person and she's a great character. We have to be aware of what's happened in other Marvel film and makes sure that her particular storyline is unique and fun and also fits in within this world that's going on at the same time. It's a little bit of an interesting story gauntlet. It's been good to have a partner. It's been an incredible experience.
