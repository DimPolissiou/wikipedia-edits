It is part of the [[University System of Georgia]]. The university was established on January 8, 2013 by a merger of North Georgia College & State University (founded 1873) and Gainesville State College (founded 1964). The regents announced plans for the merger on January 10, 2012, and the name of the new school was announced on May 8, 2012. The [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] (SACS) approved the consolidation December 11, 2012. The combined institution has campus locations in [[Dahlonega, Georgia|Dahlonega]], [[Gainesville, Georgia|Gainesville (Gainesville Campus)]], [[Watkinsville, Georgia|Watkinsville (Oconee Campus)]], [[Blue Ridge, Georgia|Blue Ridge]], and [[Cumming, Georgia|Cumming]].\n\nWith nearly 20,000 enrolled students, the University of North Georgia is the sixth-largest public university in the state of Georgia. Within UNG, there are five colleges which collectively offer over one hundred bachelor's and associate degrees, as well as thirteen master's degrees and one doctoral degree. 696 students are involved in the university's [[ROTC]] program, which has given it the designation as The Military College of Georgia. The university is one of six [[senior military college]]s in the United States.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the University of North Georgia}}\n\nNorth Georgia College and State University began in 1873 as '''North Georgia Agricultural College'''. It was originally an offsite branch of the [[University of Georgia]]'s College of Agriculture and Mechanical, and was created with funds from the [[Morrill Act]]. [[William P. Price|William Pierce Price]], a local congressman, persuaded officials at UGA to use part of the funds to establish a branch of the newly created college in Dahlonega, Price's birthplace and home. The college opened classes in 1873 with 177 students, 98 males and 79 females, making it the first coeducational college in the state.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Classes were originally held in the old [[Dahlonega Mint|U.S. mint building]] that was shut down during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. After the college was awarded the power to grant degrees in 1876, the first graduating class received degrees in 1879. The first graduating class of four consisted of three men and one woman, making North Georgia the first public institution in the state to award a degree to a female.\n\nThe college had always had a military presence, since land-grant schools were required to teach military tactics, but it was not until [[World War I]] when the military programs began to grow. The [[National Defense Act of 1916]] that created the [[ROTC]] also helped establish the military presence that is felt on the campus today. In 1929 the designation of Agricultural was dropped from the name and the school became North Georgia College. By 1932 the college was reduced to a two-year junior college. [[World War II]] saw a decline in enrollment because of the number of male students joining the war effort. This changed when an [[Army Specialized Training Program]] was placed at the college to train junior officers. After the war the college grew because of young servicemen and veterans using their [[GI bill]] benefits to attend school. By 1946 the college was reinstated as a four-year college. In the 1950s, Dahlonega provided gold for the leafing of the [[Georgia State Capitol|capitol building]]. It was also at this time that similar efforts to gold leaf Price Memorial Hall were begun, a project that did not see fruition until 1973.<ref name = \"Secret\">Roberts, William Pittman: \"Georgia's Best Kept Secret: A History of North Georgia College\" Library of Congress, 1998.</ref> It was granted university status in 1996.\n\nMeanwhile, Gainesville Junior College was founded in [[Oakwood, Georgia]] in 1964 and began holding classes in 1966. The school originally was a two-year college and for many years had an [[Open admissions|open-access mission]], meaning that it accepted all applicants who held a high school diploma. Over time, the school expanded, opening branch campuses in [[Watkinsville, Georgia]] and [[Cumming, Georgia]], and changing its name to Gainesville College and then Gainesville State College. Before consolidation with the North Georgia College and State University, the school had already begun to shift towards allowing four-year baccalaureate programs.\n\nOn January 10, 2012, the [[University System of Georgia]] approved the consolidation of North Georgia College and State University and Gainesville State College to form a new institution, the '''University of North Georgia''' in January 2013.\n\n==Campuses==\nThe University of North Georgia has campuses located in [[Dahlonega, Georgia|Dahlonega]], [[Oakwood, Georgia|Oakwood]] (Gainesville), [[Watkinsville, Georgia|Watkinsville]] (Oconee), [[Cumming, Georgia|Cumming]] and Blue Ridge. Collectively, there is {{convert|794|acre}} of land among the Dahlonega, Oakwood, and Watkinsville campuses.<ref name='colleges.usnews'>{{cite web |url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/north-georgia-state-1585 |title=North Georgia College and State University  |accessdate=March 2, 2013 |year=2011 |format=url |work=U.S. News Website |publisher=U.S. News }}</ref>\n\n===Dahlonega campus===\nUNG's [[Dahlonega, Georgia|Dahlonega]] campus is the former site of North Georgia College & State University. It was not until 1879 that the oldest surviving structure, [[Price Memorial Hall]], was constructed upon the former site of the [[Dahlonega Mint]].<ref name=\"Roberts\">{{cite book | last = Roberts | first = William Pittman | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Georgia's Best Kept Secret: A History of North Georgia College | publisher = Alumni Association of North Georgia College | year = 1998 | location = Dahlonega, Ga | pages = | url = http://www.northgeorgiaalumni.org/Page.aspx?pid=297 | doi = | id = | isbn = }}</ref> Today the gold-leafed steeple of the Price Memorial Hall building remains one of the most striking features of the UNG skyline. Much of the campus has been developed around the [[William J. Livsey]] Drill Field, more commonly known as simply \"the Drill Field\". Dahlonega is located approximately an hour's drive from [[downtown Atlanta]] ({{convert|66|mi|km}} away), an hour and half drive from [[downtown (Athens)|downtown Athens]] ({{convert|60|mi|km}} away), a two hour and fifteen minute drive from [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] ({{convert|109|mi|km}} away), and an approximately two hour and twenty minute drive from [[Greenville, South Carolina]] ({{convert|127|mi|km}} away).\n\n{{wide image|UNG drill field panorama.JPG|1200px|A panoramic view of UNG's Dahlonega Campus, showing Rogers Hall, Price Memorial Hall, Nix Fine Arts Center, Barnes Hall, Dunlap Hall, the General William J. \"Lipp\" Livsey ROTC Drill Field, the library and Lewis Residence Hall.}}\n\n===Gainesville campus===\nUntil it was consolidated with North Georgia College & State University in 2013, UNG's Gainesville campus was the location of [[Gainesville State College]]. Now known as the \"Gainesville campus\", it is located within the city limits of [[Oakwood, Georgia|Oakwood]]. It has retained its association with Gainesville, since the school was founded and located in that city. Because of its close proximity to [[Interstate 985]] and [[Georgia State Route 53]], it is conveniently accessible for much of [[Hall County, Georgia|Hall County]].\n\n=== Cumming campus ===\nIn 2012, an academic facility in Cumming, GA was opened on [[GA 400]]. The goal of the Cumming campus is to eventually offer a range of programs. The intention of the non-residential campus is to address capacity concerns for the University of North Georgia. The Cumming campus also provides higher education to an area of the state that was previously \"underserved\".<ref>[http://blog.ung.edu/mba/north-georgia-gainesville-state-to-open-instructional-facility-in-cumming/ \"North Georgia, Gainesville State to Open Instructional Facility in Cumming\"].

The campus is easily accessible from US-441 and the University of North Georgia has recently announced plans to expand the campus to accommodate the growing class sizes.<ref>\"[http://gscvoice.org/2013/01/10/ung-unveiling/ UNG Unveiling]\". Raimondi, Chris. ''Vanguard''.

The Honors Program at UNG emphasizes leadership and require students to serve in leadership positions within the Honors Program and/or other campus organizations.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Honors Program Leadership|url = http://ung.edu/honors-program/leadership.php|website = ung.edu|accessdate = November 11, 2015}}</ref> UNG is a member of the Georgia Collegiate Honors Council, the Southern Regional Honors Council,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.srhconline.org/hcol/content.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=November 11, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117042315/http://www.srhconline.org/hcol/content.php |archive-date=November 17, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> and the [[National Collegiate Honors Council]].<ref>http://honors.mga.edu/gchc/</ref>\n\nHonors classes emphasize discussion, analysis, teamwork, independent learning, and an appreciation for the interrelates of knowledge. UNG's Honors Program classes are discussion-based, emphasizing [[critical thinking]], with smaller class sizes that average between 16-18 students. These classes provide individual faculty attention, promote individual growth, and encourage creativity and innovation among students.<ref>{{Cite web|title = UNG Honors Program|url = http://ung.edu/honors-program/index.php|website = ung.edu|accessdate = November 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nUndergraduate students accepted into UNG's selective honors program receive priority registration, smaller classes, access to faculty, and peer research mentors. Students also receive professional networking, leadership, and scholarship opportunities. Students are also given the opportunity to present at state or regional Honors conferences.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Program Benefits|url = http://ung.edu/honors-program/program-benefits.php|website = ung.edu|accessdate = November 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===DETI===\nThe University of North Georgia's Distance Education & Technology Integration (DETI) program is designed to make earning a degree easier for students. It does this by making classes available online. By putting classes on the internet, this program gives more flexibility for students, especially for [[non-traditional student]]s (students who do not proceed directly from high school to college, who attend college part-time or work full-time, and more). Being able to access the University of North Georgia's accredited classes from afar gives more students the opportunity to earn a degree.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Distance Education & Technology Integration|url = http://ung.edu/distance-education-technology-integration/}}</ref>\n\nDETI is operated by sixteen staff members in the Administration, Student Success, [[Instructional Design]], and [[Technology Integration]] departments. These are joined by the numerous professors who teach the classes. These members of the faculty and staff are located in the Library & Technology Center on the [[Dahlonega]] campus, as well as the Blue Ridge, Gainesville, and Oconee campuses.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Staff DETI|url = http://ung.edu/distance-education-technology-integration/faculty-staff-bio/index.php/}}</ref>\n\n===Degrees===\nFor undergraduates the University of North Georgia offers 129 associate and baccalaureate degrees, as well as pre-professional and certificate programs. For graduates the university offers thirteen degree programs as well as one doctoral program. As a state-designated leadership institution, UNG is the only university in Georgia to offer a minor in leadership. The school is also a flagship ROTC Center in Chinese. This designation is aimed at helping cadets become proficient in Chinese language and culture.<ref name=\"ung.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://ung.edu/institutional-effectiveness/institutional-research/quick-facts.php|title=Quick Facts|website=University of North Georgia}}</ref> However, due mostly to size, each campus varies significantly in terms of which degree curricula they can accommodate. The Dahlonega campus focuses on Baccalaureate and graduate programs, and is the only one of the four campuses that offers Pre-Professional Programs. A smaller number of baccalaureate programs, most of which are education or business related, are available at the Gainesville Campus, while associate degrees are offered at both the Gainesville and Oconee campuses. As of Fall 2014, Gainesville campus is now offering a bachelor's degree in Communication and offering three concentrations in Film and Digital Media, Multimedia Journalism, and Organizational Leadership.\n\n=== Professional and continuing education ===\nThe University of North Georgia provides an array of services for professional and continuing education. Some of the programs provided include leadership development, [[photography]] classes, computer training, English and foreign language classes, travel, and industry certifications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ung.edu/continuing-education/courses/index.php|title=All Courses At All Locations|website=University of North Georgia}}</ref> These courses are designed to help people and businesses with [[job]] growth as well as recruitment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ung.edu/continuing-education/about-us/index.php|title=What We Do|website=University of North Georgia}}</ref> Courses can be taken at any University of North Georgia campus for an assorted fee. UNG also provides thousands of online professional and continuing education classes if you are unable to take classes on campus. UNG also provides space for events such as corporate events, meetings, conferences or camps. Accommodations for events include conference rooms, auditoriums, classrooms, dining, wireless internet, and parking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ung.edu/continuing-education/facilities/index.php|title=Event Facilities - Continuing Education - UNG|website=University of North Georgia}}</ref> By contacting the professional and continuing education department any business can hold an event at UNG as well as outside camps. Camps provided by the university include academic and athletic camps for kids and students. On the Gainesville and Dahlonega campuses, anyone who is not a student at the university is able to pay a fee for a gym membership and use the recreational facilities located on those campuses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ung.edu/continuing-education/fitness-memberships/index.php|title=Fitness Memberships  - Continuing Education - UNG|website=University of North Georgia}}</ref>\n\n== Student life ==\nThe University of North Georgia has 18,219 undergraduate students with a gender distribution of 44% male and 56% female. With 70% of students being full-time, Student life at UNG varies between campuses due to the differences in student housing accommodation of the two primary campuses in [[Dahlonega, Georgia|Dahlonega]] and Gainesville. Out of the 7,541 undergraduate students attending the Dahlonega campus, 36% live in college-owned housing. Unlike the Gainesville campus, which offers no student housing, the Dahlonega campus has a permanent residing student body of roughly 2,500 throughout most of the fall and spring semesters.<ref name='NGCSU by the numbers'/>\n\nApproximately 32% of students at the Gainesville and Oconee campuses are from the counties in which the campus are located ([[Hall County, Georgia|Hall]] and [[Oconee County, Georgia|Oconee]] counties). The Gainesville and Oconee campuses are located on the outskirts of the city of Gainesville and the city of [[Watkinsville, Georgia|Watkinsville]], respectively. 29% of students at the Gainesville campus are part-time, 'non-traditional' (23 years of age or greater).\n\nIn addition to its official student run multimedia news organization ''The Vanguard'', the University operates a number of official social-media pages for sharing UNG news and content.<ref>[http://ungvanguard.org/ UNG Vanguard Media] \"The Vanguard\" 2019</ref> More recently, students have made efforts to create a more distinct campus culture, operating unofficial webpages for sharing university related [[Internet Meme|memes]] and news such as the popular student-run ''No Good Nigel'' page on [[Instagram]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/no_good_nigel/|title=No Good Nigel (@no_good_nigel) \u2022 Instagram photos and videos|website=www.instagram.com}}</ref>\n\n===Student organizations===\nThe University of North Georgia has several clubs and organizations on the [[Dahlonega, Georgia|Dahlonega]], Gainesville, and Oconee campuses that students may join. Overall, there are more than 200 student organizations across the University of North Georgia campuses.<ref>\"Frequently Asked Questions.\" FAQs. University of North Georgia, n.d. Web.

The school is home to seven national fraternities, six national sororities, and one local fraternity. [[Alpha Phi Alpha]], a [[National Pan-Hellenic Council]] fraternity, has a charter at the university and is active on all campuses.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Fraternities\n!Sororities\n|-\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|\n*[[Alpha Phi Alpha]]\n*[[Delta Chi]]\n*[[FarmHouse (fraternity)|FarmHouse]]\n*[[Kappa Sigma]]\n*[[Phi Delta Theta]] (Colony)\n*[[Pi Kappa Phi]]\n*[[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]]\n*[[Sigma Chi]]\n*[[Sigma Nu]]\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|\n*[[Alpha Gamma Delta]]\n*[[Delta Phi Epsilon (social)|Delta Phi Epsilon]]\n*[[Delta Zeta]]\n*[[Kappa Delta]]\n*[[Phi Mu]]\n*[[Sigma Kappa]]\n*[[Sigma Gamma Rho]]\n\n|}\n\n===Orientation and transition programs===\nThe University of North Georgia offers four programs for new students as well as for students switching campuses. UNG Basecamp offers new students ways to improve [[leadership]] skills, including team-building exercises and community service. [[Family Day]] is an annual event that occurs during the Fall semester where new students share experiences. Transition Welcome Day for students changing campuses occurs on all five campuses. This program was designed to welcome new students to campus and help adjust. Weeks of Welcome, or WoW, are the first two weeks of the Fall semester. Each campus creates a social and educational itinerary for students to engage with others and transition into the school year.\n\n===Leadership===\n[[File:UNG Military Leadership Center.JPG|200px|thumbnail|right|The Brook Pennington Military Leadership Center]]\nThe Military Leadership Center was dedicated in 2004 to [[Brooks Pennington Jr.]], who was a World War II and [[Korean War]] Veteran, as well as a Georgia state Congressman and Senator. The Center accommodates four high-technology classrooms, a conference room, a rifle range, and the Brigade Headquarters.\n\nBecause of UNG's status as a leadership institution, it is a participant in the L3 Summit. The Summit is a six-day program during which college and university students from all over Georgia engage in team-building exercises and leadership training sessions for roughly eight hours every day. The program is usually held at some point between the spring and summer semesters.\n\n===Traditions===\n[[File:UNG arches.JPG|thumbnail|right|200px|The North Georgia Arch]]\n\n*'''Arch:''' The North Georgia Arch is located at the campus entrance near Dahlonega's town square. It was built by the Class of 1951 to commemorate their classmates who died in the [[Korean War]]. Tradition holds that freshmen are not to walk through the larger archway. Instead, they are supposed to walk through the smaller adjacent archway.\n\n[[File:UNG memorial wall.JPG|thumbnail|200px|right|Memorial Wall]]\n\n*'''Bugle Calls:'''\n**''Reveille'' is played every morning at 7:00&nbsp;a.m., at which time cadets and civilians alike stop and face the flag.\n**''Retreat/To the Colors'' is played every afternoon at 5:00&nbsp;p.m., at which time all outdoor activity on campus ceases, in order to pay respect to the American flag. Cadets stand at attention and salute the flag while civilians stop, remove their hats, face the flag, and place their right hand over their heart.\n**''Taps'' is played every evening at midnight (2:00&nbsp;a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays of open weekends) to indicate the end of the day. Cadets are required to be in their dorms at this time.\n*'''Drill Field:''' The Drill Field is located in the heart of the main campus. This field is the parade ground for the UNG Corps of Cadets, and is used for drill and ceremonies. It is also used for recreational activities, such as intramural sports, though the activities of the Corps take precedence. Although the Drill Field is roughly {{convert|800|ft|m}} long and located in at the center of the campus, students are not supposed to walk across it as a shortcut. Instead, they are asked to walk around the encircling sidewalk when traveling from one building to another. On April 18, 2009, the drill field was dedicated to retired General William J. Livsey. There is a popular campus legend regarding a decommissioned World War II submarine buried at the center of the drill field, possibly inspired by the nearby Chestatee River Diving Bell.<ref>[http://www.lumpkinhistory.org/diving-bell Chestatee Diving Bell] \"Lumpkin County Historical Society\" 2013</ref>\n*'''Memorial Wall:''' The Memorial Wall, located in front of the Memorial Hall Gymnasium, was built in 1983 in honor of UNG students and alumni that died while in military service to their country. Students do not enter the area around the wall unless they are stopping to show honor to those listed on the wall. As of 2013 the Memorial lists 174 names that died during [[World War I|WWI]], [[World War II|WWII]], the Korean War, the [[Vietnam War]], or were lost in combat.\n\n[[File:UNG Retreat Triangle.JPG|thumbnail|200px|The UNG Retreat Triangle and the sheathed 75mm pack howitzer cannon]]\n\n*'''Retreat Triangle:''' The triangle is located near the Drill Field, Student Center South, and Dunlap Hall. It holds the original retreat cannon, a 1902 three-inch (75&nbsp;mm) pack howitzer, which has been fired daily at 5 p.m. for more than 50 years. The cannon was recently restored by the North Georgia Parents Association. Students do not walk on the triangle or tamper with the cannon under any circumstances.\n\n===Center for Global Engagement===\nThe Center for Global Engagement (CGE) is home to International Student and Scholar Services, Study Abroad Services, the Federal Service Language Academy, Military International Programs, International Internships, and International Partnerships.<ref name=\"Global Engagement 2014\">Center for Global Engagement. University of North Georgia, n.d. Web.

With help from the CGE, UNG hosts over 100 international students from more than 30 countries.\n*'''Military International Programs''': The University of North Georgia (UNG) has partnered with US Army Cadet Command to send [[Cadet]]s from schools throughout the United States to a foreign country. This led to the creation of the Cadet English Language Training Team (CELTT). Its purpose is to arrange the travel of cadets overseas to assist in teaching English to foreign military counterparts. The long-term goal of this program is to establish a service learning program that can be replicated in other regions and nations in each [[Unified Combatant Command]] Area of Responsibility.\n*'''Federal Service Language Academy''': The FSLA is a summer program for high school students who are interested in federal service careers and strategic foreign languages. Students may choose to take [[Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[German language|German]], or [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. Once on campus, students hear from speakers from agencies such as the DEA, FBI, State Department, and Peace Corps. After the three-week program, students may earn high school credit if approved by their high school.\n*'''International Partnerships''': The Center for Global Engagement has established relationships with a growing number of outstanding universities worldwide. Some of the programs are only in the development phase, but others are mature and constantly growing and evolving. These relationships usually involve student and faculty exchanges, research opportunities, international internships, and other collaborative possibilities.\n*'''International Internships''': International internships can offer the thrill of an international experience combined with the real-world practice sought after by employers.<ref name=\"Dowell, Rhonda 2014\">Dowell, Rhonda. \"FW: UNG Wikipedia \u2013 CGE.\" Message to the authors.

Since UNG does not have a football team, the Golden Eagle Band does not perform at athletic events, unlike most other collegiate marching bands. Rather, the Golden Eagle Band's primary function is to perform at UNG Corps of Cadets functions, as well as to represent the Corps of Cadets in parades around the local community and throughout the nation. Every spring the band tours the Southeastern United States, entertaining audiences that come to see the military reviews and processions. Although the majority of the Golden Eagle Band's performances are military processions, the band has recently{{when|date=August 2015}} adopted [[Drum Corps International]] techniques into its own regimen.<ref>Golden Eagle Band SOP AY 2009-2010</ref> Unlike other military units at UNG, the Golden Eagle Band is open to both cadet and civilian students.\n\n==Athletics==\n{{main|North Georgia Nighthawks}}\nUNG inherited the athletic legacy of North Georgia College & State University.

It is part of the [[University System of Georgia]]. The university was established on January 8, 2013 by a merger of North Georgia College & State University (founded 1873) and Gainesville State College (founded 1964). The regents announced plans for the merger on January 10, 2012, and the name of the new school was announced on May 8, 2012. The [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] (SACS) approved the consolidation December 11, 2012. The combined institution has campus locations in [[Dahlonega, Georgia|Dahlonega]], [[Gainesville, Georgia|Gainesville (Gainesville Campus)]], [[Watkinsville, Georgia|Watkinsville (Oconee Campus)]], [[Blue Ridge, Georgia|Blue Ridge]], and [[Cumming, Georgia|Cumming]].\n\nWith nearly 20,000 enrolled students, the University of North Georgia is the sixth-largest public university in the state of Georgia. Within UNG, there are five colleges which collectively offer over one hundred bachelor's and associate degrees, as well as thirteen master's degrees and one doctoral degree. 696 students are involved in the university's [[ROTC]] program, which has given it the designation as The Military College of Georgia. The university is one of six [[senior military college]]s in the United States.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the University of North Georgia}}\n\nNorth Georgia College and State University began in 1873 as '''North Georgia Agricultural College'''. It was originally an offsite branch of the [[University of Georgia]]'s College of Agriculture and Mechanical, and was created with funds from the [[Morrill Act]]. [[William P. Price|William Pierce Price]], a local congressman, persuaded officials at UGA to use part of the funds to establish a branch of the newly created college in Dahlonega, Price's birthplace and home. The college opened classes in 1873 with 177 students, 98 males and 79 females, making it the first coeducational college in the state.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Classes were originally held in the old [[Dahlonega Mint|U.S. mint building]] that was shut down during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. After the college was awarded the power to grant degrees in 1876, the first graduating class received degrees in 1879. The first graduating class of four consisted of three men and one woman, making North Georgia the first public institution in the state to award a degree to a female.\n\nThe college had always had a military presence, since land-grant schools were required to teach military tactics, but it was not until [[World War I]] when the military programs began to grow. The [[National Defense Act of 1916]] that created the [[ROTC]] also helped establish the military presence that is felt on the campus today. In 1929 the designation of Agricultural was dropped from the name and the school became North Georgia College. By 1932 the college was reduced to a two-year junior college. [[World War II]] saw a decline in enrollment because of the number of male students joining the war effort. This changed when an [[Army Specialized Training Program]] was placed at the college to train junior officers. After the war the college grew because of young servicemen and veterans using their [[GI bill]] benefits to attend school. By 1946 the college was reinstated as a four-year college. In the 1950s, Dahlonega provided gold for the leafing of the [[Georgia State Capitol|capitol building]]. It was also at this time that similar efforts to gold leaf Price Memorial Hall were begun, a project that did not see fruition until 1973.<ref name = \"Secret\">Roberts, William Pittman: \"Georgia's Best Kept Secret: A History of North Georgia College\" Library of Congress, 1998.</ref> It was granted university status in 1996.\n\nMeanwhile, Gainesville Junior College was founded in [[Oakwood, Georgia]] in 1964 and began holding classes in 1966. The school originally was a two-year college and for many years had an [[Open admissions|open-access mission]], meaning that it accepted all applicants who held a high school diploma. Over time, the school expanded, opening branch campuses in [[Watkinsville, Georgia]] and [[Cumming, Georgia]], and changing its name to Gainesville College and then Gainesville State College. Before consolidation with the North Georgia College and State University, the school had already begun to shift towards allowing four-year baccalaureate programs.\n\nOn January 10, 2012, the [[University System of Georgia]] approved the consolidation of North Georgia College and State University and Gainesville State College to form a new institution, the '''University of North Georgia''' in January 2013.\n\n==Campuses==\nThe University of North Georgia has campuses located in [[Dahlonega, Georgia|Dahlonega]], [[Oakwood, Georgia|Oakwood]] (Gainesville), [[Watkinsville, Georgia|Watkinsville]] (Oconee), [[Cumming, Georgia|Cumming]] and Blue Ridge.

The campus is easily accessible from US-441 and the University of North Georgia has recently announced plans to expand the campus to accommodate the growing class sizes.<ref>\"[http://gscvoice.org/2013/01/10/ung-unveiling/ UNG Unveiling]\". Raimondi, Chris. ''Vanguard''.

The Honors Program at UNG emphasizes leadership and require students to serve in leadership positions within the Honors Program and/or other campus organizations.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Honors Program Leadership|url = http://ung.edu/honors-program/leadership.php|website = ung.edu|accessdate = November 11, 2015}}</ref> UNG is a member of the Georgia Collegiate Honors Council, the Southern Regional Honors Council,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.srhconline.org/hcol/content.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=November 11, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117042315/http://www.srhconline.org/hcol/content.php |archive-date=November 17, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> and the [[National Collegiate Honors Council]].<ref>http://honors.mga.edu/gchc/</ref>\n\nHonors classes emphasize discussion, analysis, teamwork, independent learning, and an appreciation for the interrelates of knowledge. UNG's Honors Program classes are discussion-based, emphasizing [[critical thinking]], with smaller class sizes that average between 16-18 students. These classes provide individual faculty attention, promote individual growth, and encourage creativity and innovation among students.<ref>{{Cite web|title = UNG Honors Program|url = http://ung.edu/honors-program/index.php|website = ung.edu|accessdate = November 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nUndergraduate students accepted into UNG's selective honors program receive priority registration, smaller classes, access to faculty, and peer research mentors. Students also receive professional networking, leadership, and scholarship opportunities. Students are also given the opportunity to present at state or regional Honors conferences.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Program Benefits|url = http://ung.edu/honors-program/program-benefits.php|website = ung.edu|accessdate = November 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===DETI===\nThe University of North Georgia's Distance Education & Technology Integration (DETI) program is designed to make earning a degree easier for students. It does this by making classes available online. By putting classes on the internet, this program gives more flexibility for students, especially for [[non-traditional student]]s (students who do not proceed directly from high school to college, who attend college part-time or work full-time, and more). Being able to access the University of North Georgia's accredited classes from afar gives more students the opportunity to earn a degree.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Distance Education & Technology Integration|url = http://ung.edu/distance-education-technology-integration/}}</ref>\n\nDETI is operated by sixteen staff members in the Administration, Student Success, [[Instructional Design]], and [[Technology Integration]] departments. These are joined by the numerous professors who teach the classes. These members of the faculty and staff are located in the Library & Technology Center on the [[Dahlonega]] campus, as well as the Blue Ridge, Gainesville, and Oconee campuses.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Staff DETI|url = http://ung.edu/distance-education-technology-integration/faculty-staff-bio/index.php/}}</ref>\n\n===Degrees===\nFor undergraduates the University of North Georgia offers 129 associate and baccalaureate degrees, as well as pre-professional and certificate programs. For graduates the university offers thirteen degree programs as well as one doctoral program. As a state-designated leadership institution, UNG is the only university in Georgia to offer a minor in leadership. The school is also a flagship ROTC Center in Chinese. This designation is aimed at helping cadets become proficient in Chinese language and culture.<ref name=\"ung.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://ung.edu/institutional-effectiveness/institutional-research/quick-facts.php|title=Quick Facts|website=University of North Georgia}}</ref> However, due mostly to size, each campus varies significantly in terms of which degree curricula they can accommodate. The Dahlonega campus focuses on Baccalaureate and graduate programs, and is the only one of the four campuses that offers Pre-Professional Programs. A smaller number of baccalaureate programs, most of which are education or business related, are available at the Gainesville Campus, while associate degrees are offered at both the Gainesville and Oconee campuses. As of Fall 2014, Gainesville campus is now offering a bachelor's degree in Communication and offering three concentrations in Film and Digital Media, Multimedia Journalism, and Organizational Leadership.\n\n=== Professional and continuing education ===\nThe University of North Georgia provides an array of services for professional and continuing education. Some of the programs provided include leadership development, [[photography]] classes, computer training, English and foreign language classes, travel, and industry certifications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ung.edu/continuing-education/courses/index.php|title=All Courses At All Locations|website=University of North Georgia}}</ref> These courses are designed to help people and businesses with [[job]] growth as well as recruitment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ung.edu/continuing-education/about-us/index.php|title=What We Do|website=University of North Georgia}}</ref> Courses can be taken at any University of North Georgia campus for an assorted fee. UNG also provides thousands of online professional and continuing education classes if you are unable to take classes on campus. UNG also provides space for events such as corporate events, meetings, conferences or camps. Accommodations for events include conference rooms, auditoriums, classrooms, dining, wireless internet, and parking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ung.edu/continuing-education/facilities/index.php|title=Event Facilities - Continuing Education - UNG|website=University of North Georgia}}</ref> By contacting the professional and continuing education department any business can hold an event at UNG as well as outside camps. Camps provided by the university include academic and athletic camps for kids and students. On the Gainesville and Dahlonega campuses, anyone who is not a student at the university is able to pay a fee for a gym membership and use the recreational facilities located on those campuses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ung.edu/continuing-education/fitness-memberships/index.php|title=Fitness Memberships  - Continuing Education - UNG|website=University of North Georgia}}</ref>\n\n== Student life ==\nThe University of North Georgia has 18,219 undergraduate students with a gender distribution of 44% male and 56% female. With 70% of students being full-time, Student life at UNG varies between campuses due to the differences in student housing accommodation of the two primary campuses in [[Dahlonega, Georgia|Dahlonega]] and Gainesville. Out of the 7,541 undergraduate students attending the Dahlonega campus, 36% live in college-owned housing. Unlike the Gainesville campus, which offers no student housing, the Dahlonega campus has a permanent residing student body of roughly 2,500 throughout most of the fall and spring semesters.<ref name='NGCSU by the numbers'/>\n\nApproximately 32% of students at the Gainesville and Oconee campuses are from the counties in which the campus are located ([[Hall County, Georgia|Hall]] and [[Oconee County, Georgia|Oconee]] counties). The Gainesville and Oconee campuses are located on the outskirts of the city of Gainesville and the city of [[Watkinsville, Georgia|Watkinsville]], respectively. 29% of students at the Gainesville campus are part-time, 'non-traditional' (23 years of age or greater).\n\nIn addition to its official student run multimedia news organization ''The Vanguard'', the University operates a number of official social-media pages for sharing UNG news and content.<ref>[http://ungvanguard.org/ UNG Vanguard Media] \"The Vanguard\" 2019</ref> More recently, students have made efforts to create a more distinct campus culture, operating unofficial webpages for sharing university related [[Internet Meme|memes]] and news such as the popular student-run ''No Good Nigel'' page on [[Instagram]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/no_good_nigel/|title=No Good Nigel (@no_good_nigel) \u2022 Instagram photos and videos|website=www.instagram.com}}</ref>\n\n===Student organizations===\nThe University of North Georgia has several clubs and organizations on the [[Dahlonega, Georgia|Dahlonega]], Gainesville, and Oconee campuses that students may join. Overall, there are more than 200 student organizations across the University of North Georgia campuses.<ref>\"Frequently Asked Questions.\" FAQs. University of North Georgia, n.d. Web.

The school is home to seven national fraternities, six national sororities, and one local fraternity. [[Alpha Phi Alpha]], a [[National Pan-Hellenic Council]] fraternity, has a charter at the university and is active on all campuses.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Fraternities\n!Sororities\n|-\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|\n*[[Alpha Phi Alpha]]\n*[[Delta Chi]]\n*[[FarmHouse (fraternity)|FarmHouse]]\n*[[Kappa Sigma]]\n*[[Phi Delta Theta]] (Colony)\n*[[Pi Kappa Phi]]\n*[[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]]\n*[[Sigma Chi]]\n*[[Sigma Nu]]\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|\n*[[Alpha Gamma Delta]]\n*[[Delta Phi Epsilon (social)|Delta Phi Epsilon]]\n*[[Delta Zeta]]\n*[[Kappa Delta]]\n*[[Phi Mu]]\n*[[Sigma Kappa]]\n*[[Sigma Gamma Rho]]\n\n|}\n\n===Orientation and transition programs===\nThe University of North Georgia offers four programs for new students as well as for students switching campuses. UNG Basecamp offers new students ways to improve [[leadership]] skills, including team-building exercises and community service. [[Family Day]] is an annual event that occurs during the Fall semester where new students share experiences. Transition Welcome Day for students changing campuses occurs on all five campuses. This program was designed to welcome new students to campus and help adjust. Weeks of Welcome, or WoW, are the first two weeks of the Fall semester. Each campus creates a social and educational itinerary for students to engage with others and transition into the school year.\n\n===Leadership===\n[[File:UNG Military Leadership Center.JPG|200px|thumbnail|right|The Brook Pennington Military Leadership Center]]\nThe Military Leadership Center was dedicated in 2004 to [[Brooks Pennington Jr.]], who was a World War II and [[Korean War]] Veteran, as well as a Georgia state Congressman and Senator. The Center accommodates four high-technology classrooms, a conference room, a rifle range, and the Brigade Headquarters.\n\nBecause of UNG's status as a leadership institution, it is a participant in the L3 Summit. The Summit is a six-day program during which college and university students from all over Georgia engage in team-building exercises and leadership training sessions for roughly eight hours every day. The program is usually held at some point between the spring and summer semesters.\n\n===Traditions===\n[[File:UNG arches.JPG|thumbnail|right|200px|The North Georgia Arch]]\n\n*'''Arch:''' The North Georgia Arch is located at the campus entrance near Dahlonega's town square. It was built by the Class of 1951 to commemorate their classmates who died in the [[Korean War]]. Tradition holds that freshmen are not to walk through the larger archway. Instead, they are supposed to walk through the smaller adjacent archway.\n\n[[File:UNG memorial wall.JPG|thumbnail|200px|right|Memorial Wall]]\n\n*'''Bugle Calls:'''\n**''Reveille'' is played every morning at 7:00&nbsp;a.m., at which time cadets and civilians alike stop and face the flag.\n**''Retreat/To the Colors'' is played every afternoon at 5:00&nbsp;p.m., at which time all outdoor activity on campus ceases, in order to pay respect to the American flag. Cadets stand at attention and salute the flag while civilians stop, remove their hats, face the flag, and place their right hand over their heart.\n**''Taps'' is played every evening at midnight (2:00&nbsp;a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays of open weekends) to indicate the end of the day. Cadets are required to be in their dorms at this time.\n*'''Drill Field:''' The Drill Field is located in the heart of the main campus. This field is the parade ground for the UNG Corps of Cadets, and is used for drill and ceremonies. It is also used for recreational activities, such as intramural sports, though the activities of the Corps take precedence. Although the Drill Field is roughly {{convert|800|ft|m}} long and located in at the center of the campus, students are not supposed to walk across it as a shortcut. Instead, they are asked to walk around the encircling sidewalk when traveling from one building to another. On April 18, 2009, the drill field was dedicated to retired General William J. Livsey. There is a popular campus legend regarding a decommissioned World War II submarine buried at the center of the drill field, possibly inspired by the nearby Chestatee River Diving Bell.<ref>[http://www.lumpkinhistory.org/diving-bell Chestatee Diving Bell] \"Lumpkin County Historical Society\" 2013</ref>\n*'''Memorial Wall:''' The Memorial Wall, located in front of the Memorial Hall Gymnasium, was built in 1983 in honor of UNG students and alumni that died while in military service to their country. Students do not enter the area around the wall unless they are stopping to show honor to those listed on the wall. As of 2013 the Memorial lists 174 names that died during [[World War I|WWI]], [[World War II|WWII]], the Korean War, the [[Vietnam War]], or were lost in combat.\n\n[[File:UNG Retreat Triangle.JPG|thumbnail|200px|The UNG Retreat Triangle and the sheathed 75mm pack howitzer cannon]]\n\n*'''Retreat Triangle:''' The triangle is located near the Drill Field, Student Center South, and Dunlap Hall. It holds the original retreat cannon, a 1902 three-inch (75&nbsp;mm) pack howitzer, which has been fired daily at 5 p.m. for more than 50 years. The cannon was recently restored by the North Georgia Parents Association. Students do not walk on the triangle or tamper with the cannon under any circumstances.\n\n===Center for Global Engagement===\nThe Center for Global Engagement (CGE) is home to International Student and Scholar Services, Study Abroad Services, the Federal Service Language Academy, Military International Programs, International Internships, and International Partnerships.<ref name=\"Global Engagement 2014\">Center for Global Engagement.

Once on campus, students hear from speakers from agencies such as the DEA, FBI, State Department, and Peace Corps. After the three-week program, students may earn high school credit if approved by their high school.\n*'''International Partnerships''': The Center for Global Engagement has established relationships with a growing number of outstanding universities worldwide. Some of the programs are only in the development phase, but others are mature and constantly growing and evolving. These relationships usually involve student and faculty exchanges, research opportunities, international internships, and other collaborative possibilities.\n*'''International Internships''': International internships can offer the thrill of an international experience combined with the real-world practice sought after by employers.<ref name=\"Dowell, Rhonda 2014\">Dowell, Rhonda. \"FW: UNG Wikipedia \u2013 CGE.\" Message to the authors.

Since UNG does not have a football team, the Golden Eagle Band does not perform at athletic events, unlike most other collegiate marching bands. Rather, the Golden Eagle Band's primary function is to perform at UNG Corps of Cadets functions, as well as to represent the Corps of Cadets in parades around the local community and throughout the nation. Every spring the band tours the Southeastern United States, entertaining audiences that come to see the military reviews and processions. Although the majority of the Golden Eagle Band's performances are military processions, the band has recently{{when|date=August 2015}} adopted [[Drum Corps International]] techniques into its own regimen.<ref>Golden Eagle Band SOP AY 2009-2010</ref> Unlike other military units at UNG, the Golden Eagle Band is open to both cadet and civilian students.\n\n==Athletics==\n{{main|North Georgia Nighthawks}}\nUNG inherited the athletic legacy of North Georgia College & State University.

He is a smart-aleck with a fast wit and a deadpan sense of humor. He convinces his parents to let his best friend [[Steven Hyde]] move in with them, making Hyde like a brother. His father, Red, is always hard on him (as a way to toughen him to be a man). Eric is in a relationship with his longtime love and neighbor [[Donna Pinciotti]]. He decides to become a teacher after high school, and he leaves the series at the end of the seventh season to teach in Africa, and returns for the series finale, reuniting with Donna.\n===Donna Pinciotti===\n{{Main|Donna Pinciotti}}\nPortrayed by '''[[Laura Prepon]]''': Eric's longtime girlfriend (and briefly fianc\u00e9e). Donna is intelligent, good-looking, and a feminist [[tomboy]]. Although she does not agree with what Jackie represents in the beginning of the series, they become friends. Donna is in a relationship with Eric for seven seasons (despite their break-up during season 4). She has brief romances with Casey, Michael's brother, and with Randy during the final season and quickly ends it. She rekindles her relationship with Eric at the end of the show's finale.\n===Steven Hyde===\n{{Main|Steven Hyde}}\nPortrayed by '''[[Danny Masterson]]''': Eric's best friend and the anti-establishment member of the group. By the end of season one, Kitty Forman prevails on her husband to allow Hyde to move in after he was abandoned by his mother (played by [[Katey Sagal]]) and living in squalor. Hyde has a witty, blunt, and sarcastic sense of humor, and a rebellious personality. He is also smart and realistic, and the other group members often ask for his advice. Although Hyde dates Jackie for three seasons, they eventually part and in the final season he marries an exotic dancer/stripper named Samantha, who, unknown to Hyde was still wed to her first husband ([[Sam McMurray]]) when she married him. As Donna points out in \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 8)#ep194|My Fairy King]]\", that means Hyde and Samantha are not [[bigamy|legally married]]. In the seventh season, Hyde meets his biological father (William Barnett, played by [[Tim Reid]]), a wealthy African American businessman. Hyde also has a straight-laced half-sister name Angie from this newfound relationship. Barnett, who owns a chain of record stores, makes Hyde first the manager, and later the owner, of the Point Place store called Grooves.\n===Michael Kelso===\n{{Main|Michael Kelso}}\nPortrayed by '''[[Ashton Kutcher]]''': The dim-witted sex obsessed pretty boy of the group who wants to coast through life on his good looks. He spends the first half of the series in a relationship with the equally vapid Jackie but their relationship comes to an end when Jackie wants to marry him and he isn't ready, so he runs away to California with Donna in the Season 4 finale. His best friend is Fez. He fathers a baby girl named Betsy during the seventh season after getting a girl name Brooke pregnant. He becomes a police officer but gets kicked off the force because he does just about everything wrong. He gets a job as a security guard at a [[Playboy Club]] in [[Chicago]], and leaves the series during the eighth and final season. He only appears in five episodes during season eight, including the [[That '70s Finale|series finale]].\n===Jackie Burkhart===\n{{Main|Jackie Burkhart}}\nPortrayed by '''[[Mila Kunis]]''': The youngest member of the group, Jackie starts the series as the pretty, rich, spoiled, selfish, conceited, annoying, and immature girl. She makes thoughtless and superficial comments, which occasionally turn out to be correct. As the series progresses, after her wealthy father is jailed and her mother (first played by [[Eve Plumb]] in an early episode, and later, permanently, by [[Brooke Shields]]) abandons Point Place, Jackie becomes less self-centered and is forced to take a job. She becomes more needy of genuine love and affection. Partly as a result of these changes, she and Donna become better friends. By the end of the series, Jackie has dated three of the four males of the original group: Kelso, Hyde, and Fez.\n===Fez===\n{{Main|Fez (That '70s Show)}}\nPortrayed by '''[[Wilmer Valderrama]]''': The [[foreign exchange student]] of the group whose hormones seem to be out of control. His country of origin is one of the longest-running gags on the show. He is sweet, friendly, perverted, gullible, and rather odd. He enjoys eating candy, drinking beer, and looking at pornography. His best friend is Michael Kelso, and he shares a \"younger brother\" type relationship with Hyde and Eric. He constantly flirts with Jackie and Donna and often makes romantic advances toward them. Initially, he has a lot of trouble getting attention from girls, but during the eighth season he becomes a [[wikt:lady's man|ladies' man]]. He is in love with Jackie throughout the series, but his love is not reciprocated until the eighth season when they become a couple.\n\n===Red Forman===\n{{Main|Red Forman}}\nPortrayed by '''[[Kurtwood Smith]]''': Kitty's husband, Eric's and Laurie's father, and Hyde's adoptive father. Red is a Navy combat veteran, having served in [[World War II]] and the Korean War. Impatient, short-tempered, often grouchy and constantly threatening to stick his foot up in someone's ass, he occasionally displays a soft side. His hobbies include working with his power tools, drinking beer, watching television, reading the newspaper, hunting, and fishing. He shows no respect for Fez because he's a foreigner, sometimes he gives him offensive nicknames like Tonto and Ali Baba.\n===Kitty Forman===\n{{Main|Kitty Forman}}\nPortrayed by '''[[Debra Jo Rupp]]''': Eric's mother and Red's wife, Kitty is a cheerful, doting, often oversolicitous mother, who can turn cold and assertive when pushed too far. A nurse and former smoker (though begins again occasionally), she drinks far too much. Her major mood swings are usually attributed to [[menopause]]. She is also an overly nurturing mother figure to Eric's friends, especially Fez and Hyde.\n\n===Bob Pinciotti===\nPortrayed by '''[[Don Stark]]''': Midge's husband, Donna's father. Bob often brags about his service in the National Guard, which invariably irritates Red. Bob is also known for walking around his house with his robe wide open and no underwear. He eats constantly, even in bed. Bob is almost always in a good mood and is a ladies' man. His best friend is Red, even though Red sees him as a nuisance. He usually takes the brunt of Red's abuse in a jolly manner.\n===Midge Pinciotti===\nPortrayed by '''[[Tanya Roberts]]''': Bob's wife, Donna's mother, and Kitty's best friend. Midge was the sexy neighborhood mom Eric and his male friends fantasized about when coming of age. Although often dim-witted, she is also a kind-hearted woman who develops feminist ideals. She and Bob divorce when she is written out of the series after the third season, however, returns during the sixth and seventh seasons in a recurring role where she and Bob almost reunite.\n===Laurie Forman===\nPortrayed by '''[[Lisa Robin Kelly]]'''/'''[[Christina Moore]]''': Eric's beautiful but mean older sister. She is also the foster sister of Steven Hyde. Laurie enjoys tormenting Eric and manipulating her father. She is [[Promiscuity|promiscuous]], meaning she's often seen with various men, mainly Eric's friend Kelso, who cheats on his girlfriend, Jackie. Eric, Hyde, and Donna often mock her promiscuity, including calling her \"The Village Whore\". Laurie has a strained relationship with her mother, who, unlike Red, sees Laurie for what she really is. Laurie leaves the series during the third season but returns in a recurring role during the fifth, somewhat chastened. At one point, she genuinely seeks out a loving relationship, rather than merely a physical one, with Kelso, who is dumbfounded. She also becomes attached to a baby for whom she is babysitting, and feels quasi-maternal pangs, which soon disappear. In season five, she and Fez marry to prevent him from getting deported. In season six, due to Kelly's health issues, Laurie was portrayed by Moore.\n===Leo Chingkwake===\nPortrayed by '''[[Tommy Chong]]''': A hippie, and the owner of a Foto Hut at which Hyde once worked. Leo is an Army veteran who served in World War II, where he was awarded a [[Purple Heart]]. Leo often puts play before work and maintains an easy-going attitude in most things, business included. He disappears from the series after season four but is later referenced in season five's \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 5)#ep120|The Battle of Evermore]]\" when the gang goes on a mission to find him, but with no luck. He returns in season seven and remains on the series until the show's end. In season 8, he gets a new job working for Hyde at Grooves.\n===Randy Pearson===\nPortrayed by '''[[Josh Meyers (actor)|Josh Meyers]]''': The newest member of the group, Randy is introduced in the final season. Tall and handsome, he is laid back, polite, and forms a friendship with Red who is impressed at Randy's skill at fixing things. While Hyde, Jackie, Donna, and Kelso accept him as a new member of their group, Fez does not. Randy dates Donna for the majority of season eight, causing Kitty to be infuriated with both of them. Donna eventually breaks up with him, and reconciles with Eric when he returns in the last episode of the series.\n\n==Recurring characters==\n*'''{{visible anchor|Angie Barnett}}''' (played by [[Megalyn Echikunwoke]]) is [[Steven Hyde]]'s half-sister. Hyde did not know he had a sister until the [[List of That '70s Show episodes#Season 7: 2004\u20132005|7th season]]. Angie graduated from college as a [[mathematics]] major. Angie and Hyde worked together managing their father's record store, but Angie did not always like working with him. She dated Kelso, which sometimes annoyed Hyde. Angie got her name because, in the seventh season, all episodes were named after [[Rolling Stones]] songs, and \"[[Angie (song)|Angie]]\" was a song by the Stones.\n*'''{{visible anchor|Annette Berkardt}}''' (played by [[Jessica Simpson]]) was Michael Kelso's girlfriend for a brief period of time in [[List of That '70s Show episodes#Season 5: 2002\u20132003|season 5]]. She acts and talks very similar to Jackie, constantly bossing Kelso around. Eric and Donna once referred to her as a blonde version of Jackie, or \"Blackie.\" Despite this, Jackie and Annette hated each other. Once at The Hub, Jackie said to Annette \"I did not know they let 'slutballs' in here\". Annette said since she saw Jackie in there she thought it was okay. Later in the episode, when Annette and Kelso were kissing, Jackie yelled \"Get off my boyfriend!\" to Annette, even though it was months after Kelso and Jackie broke up. This led to Hyde wanting to break up with Jackie.\n*'''Beatrice \"Bea\" Sigurdson''' (played by [[Betty White]]) is [[Kitty Forman]]'s mother. Bea seems like a friendly old lady, but is cold and critical, especially of Kitty. She appeared in a few episodes in season five, often nagging at Burt or saying something rude to Kitty in a faux-friendly manner. She was widowed in \"Your Time is Gonna Come\" when Burt collapses in the driveway and is rushed to the hospital where he dies. She shows little emotion after her husband's death but Kitty does catch her crying in a bedroom. Bea stays with the Formans for a while after Burt's death, causing Kitty considerable stress.\n*'''Bernice Forman''' (played by [[Marion Ross]]) is [[Red Forman]]'s mother. Bernice resented Kitty and was always mean to her. Kitty revealed it was because Red married her instead of an attractive and wealthy woman he once dated who Bernice liked. She appeared in the episodes \"Sunday, Bloody Sunday\", \"The Best Christmas Ever\" and \"Grandma's Dead\" of season 1, and in a flashback in the episode \"Halloween\" of season two. In the episode \"Grandma's Dead\" she dies in Eric's car while he is driving her home after Eric tells her off for her treatment of his mother.\n*'''Brooke Rockwell''' (played by [[Shannon Elizabeth]]) was the valedictorian of the high school class two years before Eric's class. The summer after [[Michael Kelso|Kelso]]'s graduation, she had sex with him at a Molly Hatchet concert in a bathroom stall and got pregnant. Initially, Brooke did not trust Kelso because of his immaturity and did not want him in the child's life. Eventually, Kelso convinced her to give him another chance. Brooke gave birth to their daughter, Betsy in 1979.\n*'''Burt Sigurdson''' (played by [[Tom Poston]]) is Kitty Forman's father. He is often seen avoiding his wife, Bea. In one episode, he bought an [[ostrich]] farm, which was right next to a [[coyote]] farm. The coyotes ate all the ostriches and the Sigurdsons had to sell the house. Burt died in the driveway on the episode \"Your Time is Gonna Come\".\n*'''Caroline \"Crazy Caroline\" Dupree''' (played by [[Allison Munn]]) was [[Fez (That '70s Show)|Fez]]'s girlfriend in [[List of That '70s Show episodes#Season 3: 2000\u20132001|season 3]]. Fez quickly learned Caroline is very jealous and paranoid. She made threats against Donna and Jackie because Caroline felt they were going to steal Fez from her, when in fact Jackie and Donna had no intention of doing so. Caroline was once found hiding in the men's bathroom looking for Fez. Fez did not want to be with someone that aggressive and paranoid so he broke up with her. Fez and Caroline were together one last time in the [[List of That '70s Show episodes#Season 8: 2005\u20132006|eighth season]]. She got extremely angry when she found out that Fez had lied to her about Jackie being his roommate, and when she found nude photos of Donna in Fez's [[Barry White]] album (Leo hid the nude photos in the album without Fez's knowledge, but Caroline believed they were put there by Fez). Caroline appeared again in \"Sheer Heart Attack\". Fez was having sex with women once and not seeing them again and then decided that he wanted to be with only one woman, so he called Caroline. Later in the episode, Jackie told Fez that she loved him and then kissed him as Caroline walked in. This, as always, made Caroline angry with Fez and attack him viciously.\n*'''{{visible anchor|Casey Kelso}}''' (played by [[Luke Wilson]]) is [[Michael Kelso]]'s brother who was in the [[military]]. Towards the end of [[List of That '70s Show episodes#Season 4: 2001\u20132002|season 4]] he was dating [[Donna Pinciotti]]. During their relationship, there were instances of them engaging in bad behavior, such as Donna drinking and skipping school to hang out with Casey. Donna's father, Bob, felt that Casey was a bad influence and did not want Donna to date him anymore. Eric was jealous of Casey because he wanted to be with Donna, so Eric wanted them to break up. When [[Red Forman]] and Bob were discussing Casey's negative influence with Donna and Casey, Casey broke up with Donna, deciding the conflict with Bob and Red to be too much hassle. Donna felt that she and Casey were in love, but Casey felt \"I love you\" is just something you could say and do not have to really mean. Michael Kelso said that his brother Casey got bored with his girlfriends and broke up with them. During the summer of 1979, Casey was teaching [[physical education]] at [[Eric Forman|Eric's]] old high school, and Eric was in Casey's class. He likes to call Eric \"Foreplay\". his last appearance was in the Season 7 episode \"2120 So. Michigan Ave.\"\n*'''Charlie Richardson''' (played by [[Bret Harrison]]) is the son of one of Red's war buddies. Eric held a grudge against him from the time that he let some sick children win \"Eric's\" goldfish in an [[egg toss]]. Charlie only appeared in about three episodes towards the end of Season 7. Before the beginning of Season 8, Charlie accidentally fell off the water tower and died. The water tower is named the Charlie Richardson Memorial Water Tower in his honor. The original idea was to have Charlie stay on the show the entire 8th season as a replacement for Eric, but Harrison got an offer to star in [[The Loop (U.S. TV series)|''The Loop'']] so they killed Charlie off.\n*'''Christine St. George''' (played by [[Mary Tyler Moore]]) is a talk show host of ''What's Up Wisconsin''. In the episode \"Sweet Lady\", Jackie felt she was destined to be Christine's co-host on the show. She persistently tries to get the job, but Christine St. George makes Jackie her assistant instead. After a few episodes, Jackie was fired for knowing too much about her.\n*'''Earl Arthur''' (played by Robert Clendenin) is a friend of Red's who worked for Red at Price Mart. Earl frequently came to work late and slacked off on his job, so Red fired him. After that, Earl sued Red for [[wrongful termination]], however, Earl arrived too late to his own hearing, so the judge ruled in favor of Red. Later, Earl got a job working at a fast food restaurant, where he is again fired for his poor work ethic (this time for repeatedly eating the restaurant's food while on work). Earl appears in the episodes \"Red Fired Up\", \"Roller Disco\" and \"Radio Daze\".\n*'''Edna Hyde''' (played by [[Katey Sagal]]) is [[Steven Hyde]]'s biological mother. She is only in the Season 1 episodes \"Career Day\", \"Prom Night\", and \"Punk Chick\", though she only appears in \"Career Day\". She plays a large part in \"Career Day\", playing opposite Hyde when on Career Day, he has to help her in the kitchen (she was the school chef, \"Gross Edna\" at the time). In other episodes she only has lines yelling at Hyde on the porch from the inside of the house such as:\n**In ''Prom Night'' Edna: \"They're all gonna laugh at you!\" (a prom night reference to [[Carrie (1976 film)|the 1976 film, ''Carrie'']]) Steven: \"Shut up ma, you're makin' the night too damn special!\"\n**In ''Punk Chick'' Steven: \"It's still my suitcase!\" Edna: \"Nothing in this house is yours!\" Steven: \"Shut up!\"\n:Edna then ran off and abandoned Hyde, and is not heard of again until the 4th season where Hyde claims that she and his stepfather Bud got back together and ran off. After Hyde's abandonment, Kitty prevailed upon Red to let the squalor-ridden Hyde live with the Formans.\n*'''Fenton''' (played by [[Jim Rash]]) is someone with whom Fez has a feud due to a \"half-off sale, a crowded parking lot and a pair of pants that made Fez's ass look like an oil painting\" in Fez's own words. In the fifth season, he was an employee at the jewelry store where Eric bought Donna's engagement ring. He is also the landlord of the apartment that Fez and Kelso moved into in the seventh season, which later became Fez and Jackie's apartment when Kelso moved to [[Chicago]]. At first, Fenton did not want to let Kelso and Fez move in because of his feud with Fez, but later when he found out Kelso wanted the apartment to have a place to take care of his daughter, and Fenton got the impression that Kelso and Fez were \"life partners\", he let them have it. Though Fenton does not state this explicitly, his frequent innuendos about men, his lack of experience with women, his mannerisms and affect overtly imply that he is gay. Whenever he sees Fez, he says \"Oh, It's you\" in a contemptuous way. Neither Fenton nor Fez will specifically explain the reason for their mutual hostility and dislike to Eric, despite his increasing curiosity. Fenton later becomes good friends with Jackie, who persuades him not to evict Fez and end their feud. However, very shortly thereafter, she carelessly floods both their apartment and Fenton's apartment directly underneath after falling asleep while running the bathtub.\n*'''Hilary Robinson''' (played by Lara Everly) is Fez's co-worker at the salon where Fez works in season 8. Fez tried to impress her by trying to look cool which intimidated her, but when Jackie explained to her who Fez really was, she fell in love with him. Fez and Hilary dated for a few weeks, before Hilary suddenly decided to become a nun and left Fez.\n*'''Jack Burkhart''' (played by [[Paul Kreppel]]) is the father of [[Jackie Burkhart]]. After his arrest for bribery and embezzlement, he was sent to jail. Jackie ceased being a rich, privileged girl.  \n*'''Joanne Stupac''' (played by [[Mo Gaffney]]) is a girlfriend of [[Bob Pinciotti]], who appears in Seasons 4 and 5. She met Bob at the supermarket when Bob, being unable to cook, was about to buy a dozen [[TV dinner]]s. Joanne decided to teach Bob to make a [[meatloaf]] so he would not have to buy the TV dinners. She does not get along well with Red. When Red and Joanne first met, they got into an argument about who would cook the [[meat]] and who would make the [[salad]]. Joanne works at the [[dog food]] factory and hires Eric to work there to put [[coupon]]s in the [[dog]] food bags. Eric would eventually lose that job after Joanne broke up with Bob.\n*'''Mitch Miller''' (played by [[Seth Green]]) is a student in the same class as Eric. Mitch had a feud with Fez and because of this conflict, Mitch published a photo of Fez and Kelso kissing each other in the school newspaper. Mitch had a crush on Donna Pinciotti, and one time Donna went to a wedding with Mitch. Eric was angered when Mitch embarrassed Donna, and Eric and Mitch agreed to fight each other the next day at 5:15 PM. Not wanting to fight, Mitch persuaded Eric not to fight with him by offering him a French-made GI Joe called \"GI Jacques\". Mitch has a father, Charlie Miller, played by [[Fred Willard]].\n*'''Nina Bartell''' (played by [[Joanna Canton]]) is a girlfriend of [[Fez (That '70s Show)|Fez]] in season 5 who worked with him at the [[Department of Motor Vehicles|DMV]]. Fez lost his [[virginity]] to her, but it went badly, so she suggested they needed to do it more often to get better. They broke up a while later because Nina thought he was too needy.\n*'''Officer Kennedy''' (played by [[James L. Avery, Sr.|James Avery]]) is Kelso's training officer when he joins the police force. He appears mostly in the 6th season, playing a straight ace to the bumbling Kelso.\n*'''Pam Burkhart''' (played by [[Eve Plumb]] in Season 1 and [[Brooke Shields]] in Season 6) is the mother of [[Jackie Burkhart]] who was dating Bob Pinciotti in season 6. Once a serious business lady, she fled to Mexico when Jackie's councilman father was arrested for bribery and embezzling $60,000. She returned to try to fix her relationship between her and Jackie.\n*'''Pam Macy''' (played by Jennifer Lyons) is a classmate of the main characters of the show. She has been mentioned in more episodes than she appeared, mostly by Michael Kelso. She appeared in the episodes \"Prom Night\", \"Romantic Weekend\", and \"It's a Wonderful life\". In \"Prom Night\", Michael took Pam to the prom while temporarily broken up with Jackie. In \"Romantic Weekend\", Kelso was about to have sex with Pam but was unable to perform, telling his friends \"[[Erectile disfunction|The buffer wouldn't buff]]\". Pam told the whole school, which caused everyone to tease Kelso about it.\n*'''Pastor Dave''' (played by [[Kevin McDonald]]), Pastor Dave is the local pastor at the church. He is overly cheerful and (incorrectly) thinks he is up to date with the trends, and is \"hip and cool\". He is often greeted by Eric and his friends with deadpan voices, and they typically just agree with Dave in the hopes he'll go away. Dave is good friends with Kitty, who helps with the church fundraisers, and has an uneasy friendship with Red (mostly because Red is not used to having friends). His friendship with Red seems to have brought out a less-pure side of Dave, as he spends a day with Red watching football and drinking beer, and once even quit the church because he wanted to watch more football on Sundays (he later rejoins as the pastor again). He appears primarily in Season 3 and 4, but has a few cameos in Season 2.\n*'''Rhonda Tate''' (played by [[Cynthia Lamontagne]]) Often called \"Big Rhonda\" by her classmates, she was a recurring character during season 4. She was Fez's girlfriend during this season. When she and Fez were stuck in the school during a tornado, he was about to have sex with Rhonda, but after the tornado ended, she did not want to anymore. She broke up with Fez after she choked him after he wanted to get to third base, which came from bad advice from Casey Kelso. Like Fez, she loves candy. She treats Eric with relentless contempt but was genuinely fond of Fez. She also physically intimidated tiny Jackie by threatening to wrestle her after Jackie gets rude with her. The episode \"It's a Wonderful Life\" featured an alternate timeline, where Rhonda went to the prom with Eric (in this timeline, Eric and Donna were never in a relationship), and they remained together until he dumped her. Eric mentions that the two only had sex three times. Later in the same episode, she is seen at their 10-year reunion but now as a trim, beautiful, and sexy woman, which Rhonda claims came from being dumped by Eric which led her to lose weight thanks to Jane Fonda workout tapes and to become a fitness instructor herself. She thanks him for this. It was also mentioned in the season three episode \"Kitty's Birthday\" that she was hit by a car but was apparently uninjured.\n*'''Roy Keen''' (played by [[Jim Gaffigan]]) is the kitchen manager of the Holliday Hotel who employed Eric, Hyde, and Kelso to work as waiters in the hotel's restaurant during seasons 5 and 6. The character serves as the replacement of Leo who was written out during season 5, although he had been absent for several episodes. It was mentioned by Hyde that Roy was like a father figure when his father abandoned him. Roy has stated that his standards for food service are low and he goes days without washing his hands. Roy served in the [[Vietnam War]], once describing Eric as \"scrawny, but strong... like the [[Vietcong]]\". He suffers from serious trouble connecting to people. At one time he got the impression a woman was in love with him, after she insulted him when he got her some butter, and hid in her shower to surprise her with flowers. He once mentioned he was living with a woman, but moved out when she found out he was living with her in secret. It is revealed in the season 6 episode \"A Legal Matter\" that he was a police cadet who was out of the police academy for shooting a police horse.\n*'''Samantha Hyde''' (played by [[Judy Tylor]]) is Hyde's wife during season 8. They got married while Hyde was drunk in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. The two barely knew each other when they got married. Hyde did not even remember the wedding and did not know he was married until after Samantha came to Point Place to see Hyde. In the episode \"My Fairy King\", Hyde learned that Samantha was already married to someone else. After this, Hyde and Samantha's relationship ended.\n*'''Schatzie''' is a [[Dachshund]] that Red gave [[Kitty Forman|Kitty]] in an attempt to make her happy. Schatzie was in several episodes of season 5, was absent for all of season 6, then returned for only one episode towards the beginning of season 7. Red claimed that his absence was due to hiding under the house because he was afraid of the garden hose. \"Schatzie\" is German and means \"little treasure\" or \"darling\" ([[diminutive]] of \"[[wiktionary:Schatz|Schatz]]\").\n*'''Steven James \"Bud\" Hyde Sr.''' (played by [[Robert Hays]]) is Steven Hyde's stepfather. Bud Hyde worked as a [[bartender]] and is an [[alcoholic]]. Until the end of the [[List of That '70s Show episodes#Season 6: 2003\u20132004|6th season]], Steven Hyde thought Bud was his biological father. Bud Hyde abandoned Steven when he was a child and Steven was always angry at Bud for this. They temporarily reconciled in season 3, with Hyde even moving in with him. However, he would leave again at the beginning of season 4 after getting back together with Edna \u2013 forcing Hyde to move back to the Forman house. Hyde mentioned that Bud did attempt to get in touch with him again. (Bud was passed out drunk on Hyde's car.)\n*'''{{visible anchor|Suzy Simpson}}''' (played by [[Alyson Hannigan]]) appears in three episodes of season 6. She is Kelso's buddy from the police academy who is also attracted to him. Fez has a crush on Suzy and it is because of her that he and Kelso fight after Kelso lies to Fez saying that Suzy has agreed to go on a date with him when really she thinks that she is dating Kelso. However, when Fez reveals that Kelso's having a Baby with another Woman and Kelso reveals that Fez is married, she is furious and wants nothing to do with them.\n*'''Timmy Thompson''' (played by [[Paul Connor (actor)|Paul Connor]]) is an incredibly annoying fellow high-school student of the gang who always embarrasses someone with loud comments meant for everyone around to hear, that start with \"Heeey...\", such as:\n**\"Heeey, Forman and Donna got a motel room and they're going to do it!\"\n**\"Heeey, I'm taking off my pants!\"\n**\"Heeey, Forman's on a date with his mom!\"\n**\"Heeey, Donna's showed her ass!\" (while showing everyone a yearbook photo where Donna [[mooning|mooned]] the camera).<br />He only has real dialogue in the episode \"Burning Down The House\".\n*'''William James \"WB\" Barnett''' (played by [[Tim Reid]]) is [[Steven Hyde]]'s biological father. Hyde originally thought Bud Hyde was his biological father until the cliffhanger between the 6th and 7th seasons, where Kitty discovers that Steven's real father is a man who lives in [[Milwaukee]]. Sometimes people call William Barnett by his initials, \"WB\". Barnett is wealthy and owns Grooves, a chain of record stores. Barnett put Steven in charge of the Point Place record store along with his daughter (and Hyde's half sister), Angie. Barnett is an African American, which Hyde believes explains his \"coolness, afro and suspicion of [[The Man|the man]]\" (it can also be noted that when Hyde asked him who killed Kennedy his father stated \"I don't know, because they don't want me to know\"). WB's last on-screen appearance is in the first half of the series finale which is the twenty-first episode of the eighth season, \"Love of My Life\" (WB had already appeared in the fourteenth episode of that season, \"Son and Daughter\").\n\n==Intended recurring roles==\nSeveral characters on the series were written as recurring, but made only one appearance. Among them:\n*'''Tina Pinciotti''' (played by [[Amanda Fuller]]) was the younger sister of [[Donna Pinciotti]]. She first appeared in \"Eric's Burger Job\", but made no appearances following that, except for a brief mention in the episode \"Vanstock\". A similar situation occurred with unseen Valerie Pinciotti. The two are later written out with no explanation, as demonstrated in the season seven premiere, when Kitty refers to Donna as Bob and Midge's only child.\n*'''Valerie Pinciotti''' was the older never-seen sister of [[Donna Pinciotti]] and Tina Pinciotti, who in \"Eric's Birthday\" was said to be away at college but never mentioned again.\n*'''Matthew and Rebecca Erdman''' (played by [[Kevin Farley]] and Shannon Holt) were the prudish, [[fundamentalist]] host parents of Fez. They first appeared in \"Drive-In\" and convince Fez the rock music they detest is diabolical by playing a [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] album backwards. Although referenced several times, Fez's host parents make no further appearances in the show. They eventually kicked Fez out of their home because he graduated a year ago in season 7.\n*'''Buddy Morgan''' (played by [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]]) was introduced in \"Eric's Buddy\", and was intended to become a recurring character. However, the introduction of a homosexual as a love interest for Eric (at a time when both Eric and Hyde were competing for Donna) did not go over well with audiences, and Buddy was cut from the show.\n*'''Melissa''' (played by [[Reagan Gomez-Preston]]) appeared in \"Hyde Gets the Girl\" as a potential love interest for Hyde. She was intended to become his on-off girlfriend.\n*'''Patty''' (played by [[Lindsay Sloane]]) appeared in two episodes in the series' second season. She is introduced in \"Eric Gets Suspended\" along with her best friend, Mary (played by [[Melissa Joan Hart]]). The two go on a double blind date with Hyde and Fez. Hyde initially pairs with Mary, and Fez with Patty; but in the course of the date Hyde tells Fez to swap dates because he is hitting it off with Patty. Patty then returned in \"Eric and Kitty's Night Out\". In the episode, Fez and Patty become boyfriend and girlfriend. Patty's role and impact in the episode implies an intention to continue the character's appearance in the series. However, with no explanation in the show Patty is not seen or mentioned again.\n\n==Notable Guest Stars==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n*[[Amy Adams]]\n*[[Paul Anka]]\n*[[Curtis Armstrong]]\n*[[James Avery]]\n*[[Jim Beaver]] \n*[[Rachel Bilson]]\n*[[Charo]]\n*[[Erika Christensen]]\n*[[Alice Cooper]]\n*[[Shae D'Lyn]]\n*[[Roger Daltrey]]\n*[[Ashley Drane]]\n*[[Eliza Dushku]]\n*[[Alexis Dziena]]\n*[[Jamie Farr]]\n*[[Jenna Fischer]]\n*[[Joe Flaherty]]\n{{Col-break}}\n*[[Adrienne Frantz]]\n*[[Monty Hall]]\n*[[Alyson Hannigan]]\n*[[Valerie Harper]]\n*[[Jenilee Harrison]]\n*[[Isaac Hayes]]\n*[[Mitch Hedberg]]\n*[[Carolyn Hennesy]]\n*[[Howard Hesseman]]\n*[[Dwayne Johnson|Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson]]\n*Jay Johnson\n*[[Richard Karn]]\n*[[Richard Kline]]\n*[[Christopher Knight (actor)|Christopher Knight]]\n*[[Wayne Knight]]\n*[[Don Knotts]]\n*[[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]]\n{{Col-break}}\n*[[Lindsay Lohan]]\n*[[Justin Long]]\n*[[Gavin MacLeod]]\n*[[Christopher Masterson]]\n*[[Alex Nevil]]\n*[[Keri Lynn Pratt]]\n*[[Ethan Peck]]\n*[[Jack Riley (actor)|Jack Riley]]\n*[[John Ratzenberger]]\n*[[Connie Sawyer]]\n*[[Reid Scott (actor)|Reid Scott]]\n*[[Ken Shamrock]]\n*[[Jessica Simpson]]\n*[[French Stewart]]\n*[[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]]\n*[[Barry Williams (actor)|Barry Williams]]\n*[[Billy Dee Williams]]\n*[[Bruce Willis]]\n\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{That '70s Show}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of Recurring Characters Of That '70s Show}}\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Wisconsin|That '70s Show]]\n[[Category:Lists of American sitcom television characters|That '70s Show]]\n[[Category:That '70s Show characters|Characters]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''That '70s Show'' characters}}\n{{Unreferenced|date=November 2019}}\nThis is a list of characters appearing in the series ''[[That '70s Show]]''.\n\n==Cast table==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:150px;\" | Character\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:150px;\" | Portrayed by\n! colspan=\"8\" | Seasons\n|-\n! style=\"width:70px;\" | [[That '70s Show (season 1)|1]]\n! style=\"width:70px;\" | [[That '70s Show (season 2)|2]]\n! style=\"width:70px;\" | [[That '70s Show (season 3)|3]]\n! style=\"width:70px;\" | [[That '70s Show (season 4)|4]]\n! style=\"width:70px;\" | [[That '70s Show (season 5)|5]]\n! style=\"width:70px;\" | [[That '70s Show (season 6)|6]]\n! style=\"width:70px;\" | [[That '70s Show (season 7)|7]]\n! style=\"width:70px;\" | [[That '70s Show (season 8)|8]]\n|-\n!

He is a smart-aleck with a fast wit and a deadpan sense of humor. He convinces his parents to let his best friend [[Steven Hyde]] move in with them, making Hyde like a brother. His father, Red, is always hard on him (as a way to toughen him to be a man). Eric is in a relationship with his longtime love and neighbor [[Donna Pinciotti]]. He decides to become a teacher after high school, and he leaves the series at the end of the seventh season to teach in Africa, and returns for the series finale, reuniting with Donna.\n===Donna Pinciotti===\n{{Main|Donna Pinciotti}}\nPortrayed by '''[[Laura Prepon]]''': Eric's longtime girlfriend (and briefly fianc\u00e9e). Donna is intelligent, good-looking, and a feminist [[tomboy]]. Although she does not agree with what Jackie represents in the beginning of the series, they become friends. Donna is in a relationship with Eric for seven seasons (despite their break-up during season 4). She has brief romances with Casey, Michael's brother, and with Randy during the final season and quickly ends it. She rekindles her relationship with Eric at the end of the show's finale.\n===Steven Hyde===\n{{Main|Steven Hyde}}\nPortrayed by '''[[Danny Masterson]]''': Eric's best friend and the anti-establishment member of the group. By the end of season one, Kitty Forman prevails on her husband to allow Hyde to move in after he was abandoned by his mother (played by [[Katey Sagal]]) and living in squalor. Hyde has a witty, blunt, and sarcastic sense of humor, and a rebellious personality. He is also smart and realistic, and the other group members often ask for his advice. Although Hyde dates Jackie for three seasons, they eventually part and in the final season he marries an exotic dancer/stripper named Samantha, who, unknown to Hyde was still wed to her first husband ([[Sam McMurray]]) when she married him. As Donna points out in \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 8)#ep194|My Fairy King]]\", that means Hyde and Samantha are not [[bigamy|legally married]]. In the seventh season, Hyde meets his biological father (William Barnett, played by [[Tim Reid]]), a wealthy African American businessman. Hyde also has a straight-laced half-sister name Angie from this newfound relationship. Barnett, who owns a chain of record stores, makes Hyde first the manager, and later the owner, of the Point Place store called Grooves.\n===Michael Kelso===\n{{Main|Michael Kelso}}\nPortrayed by '''[[Ashton Kutcher]]''': The dim-witted sex obsessed pretty boy of the group who wants to coast through life on his good looks. He spends the first half of the series in a relationship with the equally vapid Jackie but their relationship comes to an end when Jackie wants to marry him and he isn't ready, so he runs away to California with Donna in the Season 4 finale. His best friend is Fez. He fathers a baby girl named Betsy during the seventh season after getting a girl name Brooke pregnant. He becomes a police officer but gets kicked off the force because he does just about everything wrong. He gets a job as a security guard at a [[Playboy Club]] in [[Chicago]], and leaves the series during the eighth and final season. He only appears in five episodes during season eight, including the [[That '70s Finale|series finale]].\n===Jackie Burkhart===\n{{Main|Jackie Burkhart}}\nPortrayed by '''[[Mila Kunis]]''': The youngest member of the group, Jackie starts the series as the pretty, rich, spoiled, selfish, conceited, annoying, and immature girl. She makes thoughtless and superficial comments, which occasionally turn out to be correct. As the series progresses, after her wealthy father is jailed and her mother (first played by [[Eve Plumb]] in an early episode, and later, permanently, by [[Brooke Shields]]) abandons Point Place, Jackie becomes less self-centered and is forced to take a job. She becomes more needy of genuine love and affection. Partly as a result of these changes, she and Donna become better friends. By the end of the series, Jackie has dated three of the four males of the original group: Kelso, Hyde, and Fez.\n===Fez===\n{{Main|Fez (That '70s Show)}}\nPortrayed by '''[[Wilmer Valderrama]]''': The [[foreign exchange student]] of the group whose hormones seem to be out of control. His country of origin is one of the longest-running gags on the show. He is sweet, friendly, perverted, gullible, and rather odd. He enjoys eating candy, drinking beer, and looking at pornography. His best friend is Michael Kelso, and he shares a \"younger brother\" type relationship with Hyde and Eric. He constantly flirts with Jackie and Donna and often makes romantic advances toward them. Initially, he has a lot of trouble getting attention from girls, but during the eighth season he becomes a [[wikt:lady's man|ladies' man]]. He is in love with Jackie throughout the series, but his love is not reciprocated until the eighth season when they become a couple.\n\n===Red Forman===\n{{Main|Red Forman}}\nPortrayed by '''[[Kurtwood Smith]]''': Kitty's husband, Eric's and Laurie's father, and Hyde's adoptive father. Red is a Navy combat veteran, having served in [[World War II]] and the Korean War. Impatient, short-tempered, often grouchy and constantly threatening to stick his foot up in someone's ass, he occasionally displays a soft side. His hobbies include working with his power tools, drinking beer, watching television, reading the newspaper, hunting, and fishing. He shows no respect for Fez because he's a foreigner, sometimes he gives him offensive nicknames like Tonto and Ali Baba.\n===Kitty Forman===\n{{Main|Kitty Forman}}\nPortrayed by '''[[Debra Jo Rupp]]''': Eric's mother and Red's wife, Kitty is a cheerful, doting, often oversolicitous mother, who can turn cold and assertive when pushed too far. A nurse and former smoker (though begins again occasionally), she drinks far too much. Her major mood swings are usually attributed to [[menopause]]. She is also an overly nurturing mother figure to Eric's friends, especially Fez and Hyde.\n\n===Bob Pinciotti===\nPortrayed by '''[[Don Stark]]''': Midge's husband, Donna's father. Bob often brags about his service in the National Guard, which invariably irritates Red. Bob is also known for walking around his house with his robe wide open and no underwear. He eats constantly, even in bed. Bob is almost always in a good mood and is a ladies' man. His best friend is Red, even though Red sees him as a nuisance. He usually takes the brunt of Red's abuse in a jolly manner.\n===Midge Pinciotti===\nPortrayed by '''[[Tanya Roberts]]''': Bob's wife, Donna's mother, and Kitty's best friend. Midge was the sexy neighborhood mom Eric and his male friends fantasized about when coming of age. Although often dim-witted, she is also a kind-hearted woman who develops feminist ideals. She and Bob divorce when she is written out of the series after the third season, however, returns during the sixth and seventh seasons in a recurring role where she and Bob almost reunite.\n===Laurie Forman===\nPortrayed by '''[[Lisa Robin Kelly]]'''/'''[[Christina Moore]]''': Eric's beautiful but mean older sister. She is also the foster sister of Steven Hyde. Laurie enjoys tormenting Eric and manipulating her father. She is [[Promiscuity|promiscuous]], meaning she's often seen with various men, mainly Eric's friend Kelso, who cheats on his girlfriend, Jackie. Eric, Hyde, and Donna often mock her promiscuity, including calling her \"The Village Whore\". Laurie has a strained relationship with her mother, who, unlike Red, sees Laurie for what she really is. Laurie leaves the series during the third season but returns in a recurring role during the fifth, somewhat chastened. At one point, she genuinely seeks out a loving relationship, rather than merely a physical one, with Kelso, who is dumbfounded. She also becomes attached to a baby for whom she is babysitting, and feels quasi-maternal pangs, which soon disappear. In season five, she and Fez marry to prevent him from getting deported. In season six, due to Kelly's health issues, Laurie was portrayed by Moore.\n===Leo Chingkwake===\nPortrayed by '''[[Tommy Chong]]''': A hippie, and the owner of a Foto Hut at which Hyde once worked. Leo is an Army veteran who served in World War II, where he was awarded a [[Purple Heart]]. Leo often puts play before work and maintains an easy-going attitude in most things, business included. He disappears from the series after season four but is later referenced in season five's \"[[List of That '70s Show episodes (season 5)#ep120|The Battle of Evermore]]\" when the gang goes on a mission to find him, but with no luck. He returns in season seven and remains on the series until the show's end. In season 8, he gets a new job working for Hyde at Grooves.\n===Randy Pearson===\nPortrayed by '''[[Josh Meyers (actor)|Josh Meyers]]''': The newest member of the group, Randy is introduced in the final season. Tall and handsome, he is laid back, polite, and forms a friendship with Red who is impressed at Randy's skill at fixing things. While Hyde, Jackie, Donna, and Kelso accept him as a new member of their group, Fez does not. Randy dates Donna for the majority of season eight, causing Kitty to be infuriated with both of them. Donna eventually breaks up with him, and reconciles with Eric when he returns in the last episode of the series.\n\n==Recurring characters==\n*'''{{visible anchor|Angie Barnett}}''' (played by [[Megalyn Echikunwoke]]) is [[Steven Hyde]]'s half-sister. Hyde did not know he had a sister until the [[List of That '70s Show episodes#Season 7: 2004\u20132005|7th season]]. Angie graduated from college as a [[mathematics]] major. Angie and Hyde worked together managing their father's record store, but Angie did not always like working with him. She dated Kelso, which sometimes annoyed Hyde. Angie got her name because, in the seventh season, all episodes were named after [[Rolling Stones]] songs, and \"[[Angie (song)|Angie]]\" was a song by the Stones.\n*'''{{visible anchor|Annette Berkardt}}''' (played by [[Jessica Simpson]]) was Michael Kelso's girlfriend for a brief period of time in [[List of That '70s Show episodes#Season 5: 2002\u20132003|season 5]]. She acts and talks very similar to Jackie, constantly bossing Kelso around. Eric and Donna once referred to her as a blonde version of Jackie, or \"Blackie.\" Despite this, Jackie and Annette hated each other. Once at The Hub, Jackie said to Annette \"I did not know they let 'slutballs' in here\". Annette said since she saw Jackie in there she thought it was okay. Later in the episode, when Annette and Kelso were kissing, Jackie yelled \"Get off my boyfriend!\" to Annette, even though it was months after Kelso and Jackie broke up. This led to Hyde wanting to break up with Jackie.\n*'''Beatrice \"Bea\" Sigurdson''' (played by [[Betty White]]) is [[Kitty Forman]]'s mother. Bea seems like a friendly old lady, but is cold and critical, especially of Kitty. She appeared in a few episodes in season five, often nagging at Burt or saying something rude to Kitty in a faux-friendly manner. She was widowed in \"Your Time is Gonna Come\" when Burt collapses in the driveway and is rushed to the hospital where he dies. She shows little emotion after her husband's death but Kitty does catch her crying in a bedroom. Bea stays with the Formans for a while after Burt's death, causing Kitty considerable stress.\n*'''Bernice Forman''' (played by [[Marion Ross]]) is [[Red Forman]]'s mother. Bernice resented Kitty and was always mean to her. Kitty revealed it was because Red married her instead of an attractive and wealthy woman he once dated who Bernice liked. She appeared in the episodes \"Sunday, Bloody Sunday\", \"The Best Christmas Ever\" and \"Grandma's Dead\" of season 1, and in a flashback in the episode \"Halloween\" of season two. In the episode \"Grandma's Dead\" she dies in Eric's car while he is driving her home after Eric tells her off for her treatment of his mother.\n*'''Brooke Rockwell''' (played by [[Shannon Elizabeth]]) was the valedictorian of the high school class two years before Eric's class. The summer after [[Michael Kelso|Kelso]]'s graduation, she had sex with him at a Molly Hatchet concert in a bathroom stall and got pregnant. Initially, Brooke did not trust Kelso because of his immaturity and did not want him in the child's life. Eventually, Kelso convinced her to give him another chance. Brooke gave birth to their daughter, Betsy in 1979.\n*'''Burt Sigurdson''' (played by [[Tom Poston]]) is Kitty Forman's father. He is often seen avoiding his wife, Bea. In one episode, he bought an [[ostrich]] farm, which was right next to a [[coyote]] farm. The coyotes ate all the ostriches and the Sigurdsons had to sell the house. Burt died in the driveway on the episode \"Your Time is Gonna Come\".\n*'''Caroline \"Crazy Caroline\" Dupree''' (played by [[Allison Munn]]) was [[Fez (That '70s Show)|Fez]]'s girlfriend in [[List of That '70s Show episodes#Season 3: 2000\u20132001|season 3]]. Fez quickly learned Caroline is very jealous and paranoid. She made threats against Donna and Jackie because Caroline felt they were going to steal Fez from her, when in fact Jackie and Donna had no intention of doing so. Caroline was once found hiding in the men's bathroom looking for Fez. Fez did not want to be with someone that aggressive and paranoid so he broke up with her. Fez and Caroline were together one last time in the [[List of That '70s Show episodes#Season 8: 2005\u20132006|eighth season]]. She got extremely angry when she found out that Fez had lied to her about Jackie being his roommate, and when she found nude photos of Donna in Fez's [[Barry White]] album (Leo hid the nude photos in the album without Fez's knowledge, but Caroline believed they were put there by Fez). Caroline appeared again in \"Sheer Heart Attack\". Fez was having sex with women once and not seeing them again and then decided that he wanted to be with only one woman, so he called Caroline. Later in the episode, Jackie told Fez that she loved him and then kissed him as Caroline walked in. This, as always, made Caroline angry with Fez and attack him viciously.\n*'''{{visible anchor|Casey Kelso}}''' (played by [[Luke Wilson]]) is [[Michael Kelso]]'s brother who was in the [[military]]. Towards the end of [[List of That '70s Show episodes#Season 4: 2001\u20132002|season 4]] he was dating [[Donna Pinciotti]]. During their relationship, there were instances of them engaging in bad behavior, such as Donna drinking and skipping school to hang out with Casey. Donna's father, Bob, felt that Casey was a bad influence and did not want Donna to date him anymore. Eric was jealous of Casey because he wanted to be with Donna, so Eric wanted them to break up. When [[Red Forman]] and Bob were discussing Casey's negative influence with Donna and Casey, Casey broke up with Donna, deciding the conflict with Bob and Red to be too much hassle. Donna felt that she and Casey were in love, but Casey felt \"I love you\" is just something you could say and do not have to really mean. Michael Kelso said that his brother Casey got bored with his girlfriends and broke up with them. During the summer of 1979, Casey was teaching [[physical education]] at [[Eric Forman|Eric's]] old high school, and Eric was in Casey's class. He likes to call Eric \"Foreplay\". his last appearance was in the Season 7 episode \"2120 So. Michigan Ave.\"\n*'''Charlie Richardson''' (played by [[Bret Harrison]]) is the son of one of Red's war buddies. Eric held a grudge against him from the time that he let some sick children win \"Eric's\" goldfish in an [[egg toss]]. Charlie only appeared in about three episodes towards the end of Season 7. Before the beginning of Season 8, Charlie accidentally fell off the water tower and died. The water tower is named the Charlie Richardson Memorial Water Tower in his honor. The original idea was to have Charlie stay on the show the entire 8th season as a replacement for Eric, but Harrison got an offer to star in [[The Loop (U.S. TV series)|''The Loop'']] so they killed Charlie off.\n*'''Christine St. George''' (played by [[Mary Tyler Moore]]) is a talk show host of ''What's Up Wisconsin''. In the episode \"Sweet Lady\", Jackie felt she was destined to be Christine's co-host on the show. She persistently tries to get the job, but Christine St. George makes Jackie her assistant instead. After a few episodes, Jackie was fired for knowing too much about her.\n*'''Earl Arthur''' (played by Robert Clendenin) is a friend of Red's who worked for Red at Price Mart. Earl frequently came to work late and slacked off on his job, so Red fired him. After that, Earl sued Red for [[wrongful termination]], however, Earl arrived too late to his own hearing, so the judge ruled in favor of Red. Later, Earl got a job working at a fast food restaurant, where he is again fired for his poor work ethic (this time for repeatedly eating the restaurant's food while on work). Earl appears in the episodes \"Red Fired Up\", \"Roller Disco\" and \"Radio Daze\".\n*'''Edna Hyde''' (played by [[Katey Sagal]]) is [[Steven Hyde]]'s biological mother. She is only in the Season 1 episodes \"Career Day\", \"Prom Night\", and \"Punk Chick\", though she only appears in \"Career Day\". She plays a large part in \"Career Day\", playing opposite Hyde when on Career Day, he has to help her in the kitchen (she was the school chef, \"Gross Edna\" at the time). In other episodes she only has lines yelling at Hyde on the porch from the inside of the house such as:\n**In ''Prom Night'' Edna: \"They're all gonna laugh at you!\" (a prom night reference to [[Carrie (1976 film)|the 1976 film, ''Carrie'']]) Steven: \"Shut up ma, you're makin' the night too damn special!\"\n**In ''Punk Chick'' Steven: \"It's still my suitcase!\" Edna: \"Nothing in this house is yours!\" Steven: \"Shut up!\"\n:Edna then ran off and abandoned Hyde, and is not heard of again until the 4th season where Hyde claims that she and his stepfather Bud got back together and ran off. After Hyde's abandonment, Kitty prevailed upon Red to let the squalor-ridden Hyde live with the Formans.\n*'''Fenton''' (played by [[Jim Rash]]) is someone with whom Fez has a feud due to a \"half-off sale, a crowded parking lot and a pair of pants that made Fez's ass look like an oil painting\" in Fez's own words. In the fifth season, he was an employee at the jewelry store where Eric bought Donna's engagement ring. He is also the landlord of the apartment that Fez and Kelso moved into in the seventh season, which later became Fez and Jackie's apartment when Kelso moved to [[Chicago]]. At first, Fenton did not want to let Kelso and Fez move in because of his feud with Fez, but later when he found out Kelso wanted the apartment to have a place to take care of his daughter, and Fenton got the impression that Kelso and Fez were \"life partners\", he let them have it. Though Fenton does not state this explicitly, his frequent innuendos about men, his lack of experience with women, his mannerisms and affect overtly imply that he is gay. Whenever he sees Fez, he says \"Oh, It's you\" in a contemptuous way. Neither Fenton nor Fez will specifically explain the reason for their mutual hostility and dislike to Eric, despite his increasing curiosity. Fenton later becomes good friends with Jackie, who persuades him not to evict Fez and end their feud. However, very shortly thereafter, she carelessly floods both their apartment and Fenton's apartment directly underneath after falling asleep while running the bathtub.\n*'''Hilary Robinson''' (played by Lara Everly) is Fez's co-worker at the salon where Fez works in season 8. Fez tried to impress her by trying to look cool which intimidated her, but when Jackie explained to her who Fez really was, she fell in love with him. Fez and Hilary dated for a few weeks, before Hilary suddenly decided to become a nun and left Fez.\n*'''Jack Burkhart''' (played by [[Paul Kreppel]]) is the father of [[Jackie Burkhart]]. After his arrest for bribery and embezzlement, he was sent to jail. Jackie ceased being a rich, privileged girl.  \n*'''Joanne Stupac''' (played by [[Mo Gaffney]]) is a girlfriend of [[Bob Pinciotti]], who appears in Seasons 4 and 5. She met Bob at the supermarket when Bob, being unable to cook, was about to buy a dozen [[TV dinner]]s. Joanne decided to teach Bob to make a [[meatloaf]] so he would not have to buy the TV dinners. She does not get along well with Red. When Red and Joanne first met, they got into an argument about who would cook the [[meat]] and who would make the [[salad]]. Joanne works at the [[dog food]] factory and hires Eric to work there to put [[coupon]]s in the [[dog]] food bags. Eric would eventually lose that job after Joanne broke up with Bob.\n*'''Mitch Miller''' (played by [[Seth Green]]) is a student in the same class as Eric. Mitch had a feud with Fez and because of this conflict, Mitch published a photo of Fez and Kelso kissing each other in the school newspaper. Mitch had a crush on Donna Pinciotti, and one time Donna went to a wedding with Mitch. Eric was angered when Mitch embarrassed Donna, and Eric and Mitch agreed to fight each other the next day at 5:15 PM. Not wanting to fight, Mitch persuaded Eric not to fight with him by offering him a French-made GI Joe called \"GI Jacques\". Mitch has a father, Charlie Miller, played by [[Fred Willard]].\n*'''Nina Bartell''' (played by [[Joanna Canton]]) is a girlfriend of [[Fez (That '70s Show)|Fez]] in season 5 who worked with him at the [[Department of Motor Vehicles|DMV]]. Fez lost his [[virginity]] to her, but it went badly, so she suggested they needed to do it more often to get better. They broke up a while later because Nina thought he was too needy.\n*'''Officer Kennedy''' (played by [[James L. Avery, Sr.|James Avery]]) is Kelso's training officer when he joins the police force. He appears mostly in the 6th season, playing a straight ace to the bumbling Kelso.\n*'''Pam Burkhart''' (played by [[Eve Plumb]] in Season 1 and [[Brooke Shields]] in Season 6) is the mother of [[Jackie Burkhart]] who was dating Bob Pinciotti in season 6. Once a serious business lady, she fled to Mexico when Jackie's councilman father was arrested for bribery and embezzling $60,000. She returned to try to fix her relationship between her and Jackie.\n*'''Pam Macy''' (played by Jennifer Lyons) is a classmate of the main characters of the show. She has been mentioned in more episodes than she appeared, mostly by Michael Kelso. She appeared in the episodes \"Prom Night\", \"Romantic Weekend\", and \"It's a Wonderful life\". In \"Prom Night\", Michael took Pam to the prom while temporarily broken up with Jackie. In \"Romantic Weekend\", Kelso was about to have sex with Pam but was unable to perform, telling his friends \"[[Erectile disfunction|The buffer wouldn't buff]]\". Pam told the whole school, which caused everyone to tease Kelso about it.\n*'''Pastor Dave''' (played by [[Kevin McDonald]]), Pastor Dave is the local pastor at the church. He is overly cheerful and (incorrectly) thinks he is up to date with the trends, and is \"hip and cool\". He is often greeted by Eric and his friends with deadpan voices, and they typically just agree with Dave in the hopes he'll go away. Dave is good friends with Kitty, who helps with the church fundraisers, and has an uneasy friendship with Red (mostly because Red is not used to having friends). His friendship with Red seems to have brought out a less-pure side of Dave, as he spends a day with Red watching football and drinking beer, and once even quit the church because he wanted to watch more football on Sundays (he later rejoins as the pastor again). He appears primarily in Season 3 and 4, but has a few cameos in Season 2.\n*'''Rhonda Tate''' (played by [[Cynthia Lamontagne]]) Often called \"Big Rhonda\" by her classmates, she was a recurring character during season 4. She was Fez's girlfriend during this season. When she and Fez were stuck in the school during a tornado, he was about to have sex with Rhonda, but after the tornado ended, she did not want to anymore. She broke up with Fez after she choked him after he wanted to get to third base, which came from bad advice from Casey Kelso. Like Fez, she loves candy. She treats Eric with relentless contempt but was genuinely fond of Fez. She also physically intimidated tiny Jackie by threatening to wrestle her after Jackie gets rude with her. The episode \"It's a Wonderful Life\" featured an alternate timeline, where Rhonda went to the prom with Eric (in this timeline, Eric and Donna were never in a relationship), and they remained together until he dumped her. Eric mentions that the two only had sex three times. Later in the same episode, she is seen at their 10-year reunion but now as a trim, beautiful, and sexy woman, which Rhonda claims came from being dumped by Eric which led her to lose weight thanks to Jane Fonda workout tapes and to become a fitness instructor herself. She thanks him for this. It was also mentioned in the season three episode \"Kitty's Birthday\" that she was hit by a car but was apparently uninjured.\n*'''Roy Keen''' (played by [[Jim Gaffigan]]) is the kitchen manager of the Holliday Hotel who employed Eric, Hyde, and Kelso to work as waiters in the hotel's restaurant during seasons 5 and 6. The character serves as the replacement of Leo who was written out during season 5, although he had been absent for several episodes. It was mentioned by Hyde that Roy was like a father figure when his father abandoned him. Roy has stated that his standards for food service are low and he goes days without washing his hands. Roy served in the [[Vietnam War]], once describing Eric as \"scrawny, but strong... like the [[Vietcong]]\". He suffers from serious trouble connecting to people. At one time he got the impression a woman was in love with him, after she insulted him when he got her some butter, and hid in her shower to surprise her with flowers. He once mentioned he was living with a woman, but moved out when she found out he was living with her in secret. It is revealed in the season 6 episode \"A Legal Matter\" that he was a police cadet who was out of the police academy for shooting a police horse.\n*'''Samantha Hyde''' (played by [[Judy Tylor]]) is Hyde's wife during season 8. They got married while Hyde was drunk in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. The two barely knew each other when they got married. Hyde did not even remember the wedding and did not know he was married until after Samantha came to Point Place to see Hyde. In the episode \"My Fairy King\", Hyde learned that Samantha was already married to someone else. After this, Hyde and Samantha's relationship ended.\n*'''Schatzie''' is a [[Dachshund]] that Red gave [[Kitty Forman|Kitty]] in an attempt to make her happy. Schatzie was in several episodes of season 5, was absent for all of season 6, then returned for only one episode towards the beginning of season 7. Red claimed that his absence was due to hiding under the house because he was afraid of the garden hose. \"Schatzie\" is German and means \"little treasure\" or \"darling\" ([[diminutive]] of \"[[wiktionary:Schatz|Schatz]]\").\n*'''Steven James \"Bud\" Hyde Sr.''' (played by [[Robert Hays]]) is Steven Hyde's stepfather. Bud Hyde worked as a [[bartender]] and is an [[alcoholic]]. Until the end of the [[List of That '70s Show episodes#Season 6: 2003\u20132004|6th season]], Steven Hyde thought Bud was his biological father. Bud Hyde abandoned Steven when he was a child and Steven was always angry at Bud for this. They temporarily reconciled in season 3, with Hyde even moving in with him. However, he would leave again at the beginning of season 4 after getting back together with Edna \u2013 forcing Hyde to move back to the Forman house. Hyde mentioned that Bud did attempt to get in touch with him again. (Bud was passed out drunk on Hyde's car.)\n*'''{{visible anchor|Suzy Simpson}}''' (played by [[Alyson Hannigan]]) appears in three episodes of season 6. She is Kelso's buddy from the police academy who is also attracted to him. Fez has a crush on Suzy and it is because of her that he and Kelso fight after Kelso lies to Fez saying that Suzy has agreed to go on a date with him when really she thinks that she is dating Kelso. However, when Fez reveals that Kelso's having a Baby with another Woman and Kelso reveals that Fez is married, she is furious and wants nothing to do with them.\n*'''Timmy Thompson''' (played by [[Paul Connor (actor)|Paul Connor]]) is an incredibly annoying fellow high-school student of the gang who always embarrasses someone with loud comments meant for everyone around to hear, that start with \"Heeey...\", such as:\n**\"Heeey, Forman and Donna got a motel room and they're going to do it!\"\n**\"Heeey, I'm taking off my pants!\"\n**\"Heeey, Forman's on a date with his mom!\"\n**\"Heeey, Donna's showed her ass!\" (while showing everyone a yearbook photo where Donna [[mooning|mooned]] the camera).<br />He only has real dialogue in the episode \"Burning Down The House\".\n*'''William James \"WB\" Barnett''' (played by [[Tim Reid]]) is [[Steven Hyde]]'s biological father. Hyde originally thought Bud Hyde was his biological father until the cliffhanger between the 6th and 7th seasons, where Kitty discovers that Steven's real father is a man who lives in [[Milwaukee]]. Sometimes people call William Barnett by his initials, \"WB\". Barnett is wealthy and owns Grooves, a chain of record stores. Barnett put Steven in charge of the Point Place record store along with his daughter (and Hyde's half sister), Angie. Barnett is a African American, which Hyde believes explains his \"coolness, afro and suspicion of [[The Man|the man]]\" (it can also be noted that when Hyde asked him who killed Kennedy his father stated \"I don't know, because they don't want me to know\"). WB's last on-screen appearance is in the first half of the series finale which is the twenty-first episode of the eighth season, \"Love of My Life\" (WB had already appeared in the fourteenth episode of that season, \"Son and Daughter\").\n\n==Intended recurring roles==\nSeveral characters on the series were written as recurring, but made only one appearance. Among them:\n*'''Tina Pinciotti''' (played by [[Amanda Fuller]]) was the younger sister of [[Donna Pinciotti]]. She first appeared in \"Eric's Burger Job\", but made no appearances following that, except for a brief mention in the episode \"Vanstock\". A similar situation occurred with unseen Valerie Pinciotti. The two are later written out with no explanation, as demonstrated in the season seven premiere, when Kitty refers to Donna as Bob and Midge's only child.\n*'''Valerie Pinciotti''' was the older never-seen sister of [[Donna Pinciotti]] and Tina Pinciotti, who in \"Eric's Birthday\" was said to be away at college but never mentioned again.\n*'''Matthew and Rebecca Erdman''' (played by [[Kevin Farley]] and Shannon Holt) were the prudish, [[fundamentalist]] host parents of Fez. They first appeared in \"Drive-In\" and convince Fez the rock music they detest is diabolical by playing a [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] album backwards. Although referenced several times, Fez's host parents make no further appearances in the show. They eventually kicked Fez out of their home because he graduated a year ago in season 7.\n*'''Buddy Morgan''' (played by [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]]) was introduced in \"Eric's Buddy\", and was intended to become a recurring character. However, the introduction of a homosexual as a love interest for Eric (at a time when both Eric and Hyde were competing for Donna) did not go over well with audiences, and Buddy was cut from the show.\n*'''Melissa''' (played by [[Reagan Gomez-Preston]]) appeared in \"Hyde Gets the Girl\" as a potential love interest for Hyde. She was intended to become his on-off girlfriend.\n*'''Patty''' (played by [[Lindsay Sloane]]) appeared in two episodes in the series' second season. She is introduced in \"Eric Gets Suspended\" along with her best friend, Mary (played by [[Melissa Joan Hart]]). The two go on a double blind date with Hyde and Fez. Hyde initially pairs with Mary, and Fez with Patty; but in the course of the date Hyde tells Fez to swap dates because he is hitting it off with Patty. Patty then returned in \"Eric and Kitty's Night Out\". In the episode, Fez and Patty become boyfriend and girlfriend. Patty's role and impact in the episode implies an intention to continue the character's appearance in the series. However, with no explanation in the show Patty is not seen or mentioned again.\n\n==Notable Guest Stars==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n*[[Amy Adams]]\n*[[Paul Anka]]\n*[[Curtis Armstrong]]\n*[[James Avery]]\n*[[Jim Beaver]] \n*[[Rachel Bilson]]\n*[[Charo]]\n*[[Erika Christensen]]\n*[[Alice Cooper]]\n*[[Shae D'Lyn]]\n*[[Roger Daltrey]]\n*[[Ashley Drane]]\n*[[Eliza Dushku]]\n*[[Alexis Dziena]]\n*[[Jamie Farr]]\n*[[Jenna Fischer]]\n*[[Joe Flaherty]]\n{{Col-break}}\n*[[Adrienne Frantz]]\n*[[Monty Hall]]\n*[[Alyson Hannigan]]\n*[[Valerie Harper]]\n*[[Jenilee Harrison]]\n*[[Isaac Hayes]]\n*[[Mitch Hedberg]]\n*[[Carolyn Hennesy]]\n*[[Howard Hesseman]]\n*[[Dwayne Johnson|Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson]]\n*Jay Johnson\n*[[Richard Karn]]\n*[[Richard Kline]]\n*[[Christopher Knight (actor)|Christopher Knight]]\n*[[Wayne Knight]]\n*[[Don Knotts]]\n*[[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]]\n{{Col-break}}\n*[[Lindsay Lohan]]\n*[[Justin Long]]\n*[[Gavin MacLeod]]\n*[[Christopher Masterson]]\n*[[Alex Nevil]]\n*[[Keri Lynn Pratt]]\n*[[Ethan Peck]]\n*[[Jack Riley (actor)|Jack Riley]]\n*[[John Ratzenberger]]\n*[[Connie Sawyer]]\n*[[Reid Scott (actor)|Reid Scott]]\n*[[Ken Shamrock]]\n*[[Jessica Simpson]]\n*[[French Stewart]]\n*[[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]]\n*[[Barry Williams (actor)|Barry Williams]]\n*[[Billy Dee Williams]]\n*[[Bruce Willis]]\n\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{That '70s Show}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of Recurring Characters Of That '70s Show}}\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Wisconsin|That '70s Show]]\n[[Category:Lists of American sitcom television characters|That '70s Show]]\n[[Category:That '70s Show characters|Characters]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "a > an", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_That_%2770s_Show_characters"}

Founded in 1795, it was the first institution of higher learning chartered by the [[New York State Board of Regents]].  In the 19th century, it became the \"[[Mother of Fraternities]]\",<ref name=somers304>Somers (2003), p. 304</ref> as three of the earliest [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|such organizations]] were established there.  After 175 years as a traditional all-male institution, Union College began enrolling women in 1970.\n\nThe college offers a [[liberal arts]] curriculum across some 21 academic departments, as well as opportunities for interdepartmental [[Academic major|major]]s and self-designed organizing theme majors. In common with most liberal arts colleges, Union offers a wide array of courses in arts, sciences, literature, and foreign languages, but, in common with only a few other liberal arts colleges, Union also offers [[ABET|ABET-accredited]] undergraduate degrees in [[computer engineering]], [[bioengineering]], [[electrical engineering]], and [[mechanical engineering]]. By the time they graduate, about 60% of Union students will have engaged in some form of international study or [[study abroad]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Union College Office of Institutional Studies |url=http://www.union.edu/Resources/Campus/institutional_studies/index.php |accessdate=2009-09-21|year=2008}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Founding===\n[[File:Union1795nocap.jpg|thumb|border|left|The Schenectady Academy (Old Union College), 1795]]\n\nChartered in 1795,<ref name=fortenbaugh3>Fortenbaugh (1978), p. 3</ref> Union was one the first [[non-denominational]] institutions of [[higher education]] in the United States, and the second college established in the [[State of New York]].\n\nFrom 1636 to 1769, only nine institutions of [[higher education]] were founded on a permanent basis in [[Colonial America]].{{Ref label|a|a|none}} Most had been founded in association with British religious denominations devoted to the perpetuation of their respective Christian denominations.,<ref name=\"Tewksbury 1932, p. 59\">Tewksbury (1932), p. 59</ref> Union College was to be founded with a broader ecumenical basis.\n\nOnly [[Columbia University]] (the successor of King's College, founded in 1754),<ref>{{cite book |  year = 1902 | title = A History of Columbia University, 1754\u20131904 | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York | page = 1}}</ref> had preceded Union in New York. Twenty-five years later impetus for another institution grew.  Certain that [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[John Burgoyne]]'s defeat at the [[Battle of Saratoga]] in 1777 would mean a new nation, nearly 1,000 citizens of [[upstate New York|northern New York]] (which then included what eventually became [[Vermont]]) began the first popular demand for higher education in America.<ref name=fox10>Fox (1945), p. 10</ref> As a democratic cultural changes rose and began to become dominant<ref name=rudoloph34>Rudolph (1965), p. 34</ref> old ways, in particular the old purposes and structure of higher education, were being pushed aside.<ref name=boorstin153>Boorstin (1965), p. 153</ref>\n\n[[Schenectady]], originally a Mohawk outpost, was a city founded and dominated by people originating from the [[Netherlands]], with about 4,000 residents,.<ref name=\"Somers 2003, p. 296\">Somers (2003), p. 296</ref> It was the third largest city in the state, after [[Albany, New York|Albany]] and [[New York City]]. The [[Dutch Reformed Church]], began to show an interest in establishing an academy or college under its control there. In 1778, the Schenectady Dutch Reformed Church invited the Rev. Dirck Romeyn of [[New Jersey]] to visit.<ref name=pearson119>Pearson (1880/1980), p. 119</ref> Returning home, he authored a plan in 1782 for such an institution, and was summoned two years later<ref name=fortenbaugh36>Fortenbaugh (1978), p. 36</ref> to finally come help found it.\n\nThe Schenectady Academy was established in 1785 as the city's first organized school.<ref name=Neisular20>Neisular (1964), p. 20</ref> It immediately flourished, reaching an enrollment of about 100 within a year.  By at least 1792 it offered a full four-year college course, as well as one of elementary and practical subjects taught mainly to girls.<ref name=somers629>Somers (2003), p. 629</ref> Attempts to charter the Academy as a college with the [[University of the State of New York|Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York]] in 1786, 1792, and 1793 were rejected<ref name=\"Somers 2003, p. 296\"/> on the grounds the school was not yet either academically or financially qualified.<ref name=hough146>Hough (1885), p. 146</ref>\n\nThe following year the school reapplied, as \"Union College\", a name chosen to reflect the resolution that the school should be free of any specific religious affiliation.<ref name=raymond1:34>Raymond (1907), p. 1:34</ref>  The resulting institution was awarded its charter on February 25, 1795 &ndash; still celebrated by the College as \"Founders' Day\".<ref name=yates423>Yates (1902), p. 423</ref>\n\n===Seals and mottos===\n[[File:SealUnionUniversity.jpg|thumb|The Seal of [[Union University (New York)|Union University]] on the Exterior Wall of the [[University Club of New York]] in Manhattan]]\n[[File:Minervaliberty.jpg|thumb|''[[Minerva]] as the Patroness of American Liberty'' (1791) by [[Giuseppe Ceracchi]]]]\n\nThe College's charter provided for the design of an official [[Seal (impression)|seal]] to be used on [[diploma]]s and other official business documents and correspondence. The Trustees were also authorized to select the \"devices and inscription\" to be engraved on the seal.<ref name=raymond1:38>Raymond (1907), p. 1:38</ref>  A committee of four Trustees was appointed to look into the matter, and a seal was approved in November 1796. The original seal and its press have been lost, but it is known that it was nearly identical to the seal in use today (from an impression on a document from 1796).<ref name=fortenbaugh74>Fortenbaugh (1978), p. 74</ref>\n\nThe Union College seal combines ancient and modern elements in balanced proportions. The head of the [[Roman goddess]] [[Minerva]] ([[Greek goddess]] [[Athena]]) appears in the center of an oval with an outside star pattern surrounding the whole.  Around the central figure are the [[French language|French]] words ''\"Sous les lois de Minerve nous devenons tous fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs\"'' ({{lang-en|Under the laws of Minerva, we all become brothers and sisters}}).<ref name=fortenbaugh73>Fortenbaugh (1978), p. 73</ref>  Originally, the motto ended with the [[French language|French]] word ''\"fr\u00e8res\"'' ({{lang-en|brothers}}), but in 2015 the College modified the motto to add the [[French language|French]] words ''\"et s\u0153urs\"'' ({{lang-en|and sisters}}).<ref name=sisters>{{cite web|title= Union's age-old motto gets a modern makeover|url=https://www.union.edu/news/stories/2015/11/unions-age-old-motto-gets-a-modern-makeover.php|accessdate=23 July 2018}}</ref> On a banner just above the central figure are the words ''\"St: of N: York\"'' and on a similar banner below the central figure appear the words: ''\"Union College 1795\"''. The precise origins of the motto and the choice of Minerva as the fundamental element of the College seal are obscure, but two things are certain: like most colleges of the time, Union was deeply rooted in the classical tradition, but, unlike most colleges, Union chose a modern language rather than [[Latin]] for its motto. The resulting tone of the entire seal is thus historically aware, but distinctly modern in outlook.<ref name=somers636>Somers (2003), p. 636; See also Fortenbaugh, ''passim''.</ref>\n\nIt is not at all surprising that the original trustees should have chosen Minerva as their herald and representative. Minerva began her mythological career as a local Italian deity ([[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan]], but possibly with Greek influences), patroness of the arts and crafts.<ref name=altheim265>Altheim (1938), p. 265</ref>  By the time she was well established as a Roman goddess, the scope of her interests and patronage had broadened to include at least painting, poetry, drama, and teaching. Somewhat paradoxically, Minerva was also associated with the arts of war\u2014hence her image is usually that of a female dressed for battle.<ref name=smith2:1090>Smith (1867), p. 1:1090</ref>  Very early, Minerva was identified with the Greek goddess Athena, and invested with many of that deity's characteristics and iconography.<ref name=fowler234>Fowler (1911), p. 234</ref>  Eventually\u2014certainly by the 18th century\u2014Minerva had come to represent all of those qualities that might be wished for in a rational, virtuous, prudent, wise, and \"scientific\" man: just the sort of progressive individual who might found a new nation (or college) based on sound republican principles and liberal Christian (Protestant) morals.<ref name=king123>King (1750), p. 123</ref>  When the [[French Academy of Sciences|Paris Academy of Sciences]] met for the first time in 1666, a commemorative medal was struck portraying Minerva on its reverse, surrounded by symbols of astronomy, anatomy, and chemistry.<ref name=hahn4>Hahn (1971), p. 4</ref>  The [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], founded in 1780, took Minerva as its model, along with the motto ''\"Sub libertate florent\"'', intending to imply that the arts and sciences flourish best in a free society.<ref>{{cite book | year = 1785 | title = Memoirs of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences | publisher = Adams and Nourse | location = Boston | page = 1:638}}</ref>  Clearly, Minerva was very much an icon of the [[Scientific Revolution]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].\n\nWhile the rationale behind the connection between Union College and Minerva is relatively clear, there is less agreement with respect to the history of the College's motto.<ref name=somers636/>  Its egalitarian theme is consistent with the non-denominational and generally democratic spirit of Union's founding. It also declares the brotherhood of man, or of the community of mankind, in a sense familiar to the Enlightenment (and, of course, to the French revolutionaries). But that it does so with the qualification \"under the laws of Minerva\" is important.<ref name=somers637>Somers (2003), p. 637</ref>  Even though Minerva was a pagan goddess, and the Union College founders devout Protestants, there was still plenty of room for a belief that men could come together as brothers in a community ruled by reason, virtue, and [[natural law]] (or, as the case may be, the [[Law of God]]). The Latin motto on the seal of Union University supports this argument: ''In necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas'' (English: Unity in necessary matters, freedom in doubtful matters, charity for all). An institution of higher learning fosters unity of purpose (hence \"brotherhood\"), but not always unity of opinion, hence the freedom to disagree. The \"laws of Minerva\" enjoin rational thought rather than obligatory doctrine. Not surprisingly, the founders believed that the key to achieving this ideal state is education.  Nearly all of the differences among human beings, wherever they may be found, argued [[John Locke]], are the result of diverse education.<ref name=locke2>Locke (1764), p. 2</ref>  The founders of Union College were unabashedly optimistic that education, learning, and science could build a better world.\n\n===Presidents===\n{{multiple image  | align     = right  | direction = horizontal  | image1    = Nott2.jpg  | width1    = 175  | alt1      =  | caption1  = [[Eliphalet Nott]], president 1804&ndash;1866  | image2    = Stephen Ainlay crop.jpeg  | width2    = 182  | alt2      =  | caption2  = Stephen Ainlay, president 2006-2018 }}\nUnion College has had nineteen presidents since its founding in 1795.

[[Arithmetic]], [[geometry]], and [[calculus]] (\"[[Method of Fluxions|fluxions]]\") gave some practical application in [[navigation]] and [[surveying]].  [[Astronomy]], [[chemistry]], and [[natural philosophy]] ([[physics]]) rounded out the study of science. Finally, [[theology]] and [[moral philosophy]] as capstone subjects typically dominated much of the junior and senior years.  [[Wikt:elective#Noun|Elective]]s were essentially unheard of.<ref>{{cite book | year = 1825 | title = The Laws of Yale College | publisher = The Journal Office | location = New Haven | page = 16}}; {{cite book | year = 1821 | title = Laws of Union College | publisher = Isaac Riggs | location = Schenectady | page = 25}}; {{cite book | year = 1830 | title = Catalogue of the Officers and Students of the College of New Jersey | publisher = George Sherman | location = Trenton | page = 10}}</ref>  But by the 1820s all of this began to change.<ref name=rudolph113>Rudolph (1965), p. 113</ref>\n\nAlthough [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] remained a part of the curriculum (and do so to this day), new subjects were adopted that offered more readily apparent application to the busy commercial life of the new nation. Accordingly, French was gradually introduced into the college curriculum, sometimes as a substitute for Greek or [[Hebrew]].<ref name=rudolph51>Rudolph (1977), p. 51</ref> It is significant in this context that French was chosen for the Union College motto. By the second decade of the 19th century, calls for reform in higher education, especially in the traditional liberal arts colleges, were becoming increasingly demanding; a response was required if many of these institutions were to survive at all. The classical curriculum somehow needed to accommodate the needs of a practical, utilitarian, and egalitarian nation as it confronted its [[manifest destiny]] to conquer not only geography but nature itself. One solution to this problem was the so-called \"parallel course of study\" in scientific and \"literary\" subjects.<ref name=butts129>Butts (1939), p. 129</ref>  The basic idea was to offer a scientific curriculum in parallel to the classical curriculum, for those students wishing a more modern treatment of modern languages, mathematics, and science, equal in dignity to the traditional course of study.<ref name=Rudolph114>Rudolph (1965), p. 114</ref>  An early attempt to establish such a parallel scientific course was made by [[Hobart and William Smith College|Hobart College]] in [[Geneva, New York|Geneva]], New York, when it was founded in 1825, so that at least some students could get on with the \"practical business of life...without passing through a tedious course of classical studies.\"<ref name=hislop582n23>Hislop (1971), p. 582n23</ref>  But this experiment at Hobart soon languished, partly for lack of support by President [[Jasper Adams]]<ref name=adams32>Adams (1827), p. 32</ref> and partly for lack of funds.<ref name=butts135>Butts (1939), p. 135</ref>  A similar experiment launched by Union College in 1828 was to fare much better.\n\nIt was the [[Hudson Valley]] that gave birth to \u2013 and nurtured \u2013 the first successful attempts in America to raise applied science and technology to a collegiate level. The first technical college in the United States, [[United States Military Academy|the military academy at West Point]], was created by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1802.<ref name=Rudolph62>Rudolph (1977), p. 62</ref>  The institution that eventually became [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] (RPI) was founded in [[Troy, New York|Troy]], New York, in 1824 and incorporated in 1826 (and of which Union College president Eliphalet Nott was also president from 1829 to 1845).<ref name=sherwood484492>Sherwood (1900), pp. 484, 492</ref>  Union College introduced a parallel scientific curriculum in 1828 and a [[civil engineering]] program in 1845.<ref name=hough160>Hough (1885), p. 160</ref>  Union College, it has been said, was the \"one traditional liberal arts college in the first half of the nineteenth century to make a thoroughly uncompromising and effective place for applied science in the course of study\".<ref name=rudolph63>Rudolph (1977), p. 63</ref>  In fact, so successful were Union's reform efforts that by 1839 the College had one of the largest faculty in American higher education and an enrollment surpassed only by [[Yale University|Yale]].<ref name=guralnick38>Guralnick (1975), p. 38</ref>\n\n==Campus==\n\n===Architecture and design===\n[[File:Union1804.jpg|thumb|Union College's first home, an 1804 design built prior to the cohesive Ram\u00e9e-designed campus]]\n\nAfter Union College received its charter in 1795, it was quite natural that the college should carry on business in the same building already occupied by the Schenectady Academy. The college began conducting classes on the upper floor, while a [[grammar school]] continued to be conducted on the lower floor.<ref name=somers630>Somers (2003), p. 630</ref>  It soon became clear that this space would prove inadequate for the growing college (or at least for the optimistic plans of the founders). In 1796, the state of New York appropriated $10,000 (roughly ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|10000|1800}}}} today) for a new building, and construction began two years later on the edge of the original Schenectady town site.<ref name=hough154>Hough (1885), p. 154</ref> The ground plan of the new buildings was to be {{Convert|150|by|60|ft|m}}, the superstructure rising three stories, topped by a [[cupola]].<ref name=hough155n>Hough (1885), p. 155n</ref>  There is reason to believe that the design of the building was influenced by that of [[Princeton University|Princeton]]'s [[Nassau Hall]] (sometimes described as the [[Italianate architecture|Italianate style]]).<ref name=somers789>Somers (2003), p. 789</ref>  The new building was occupied in 1804, despite continuing financial difficulties, and two dormitories were constructed nearby.\n\nHowever, Eliphalet Nott, arriving as president of the college in 1804 (having been a trustee since 1800) was not daunted by the obstacles to growth and expansion created by lack of funds, a reluctant [[New York State Legislature|legislature]], and a sometimes litigious Board of Trustees. Even as the booming city of Schenectady was alive with commercial activity,<ref name=hislop139>Hislop (1971), p. 139</ref> Nott was envisioning a college that would to a large extent protect and shield its students from the lowlife and temptations that inevitably accompanied rapid economic growth on the frontier. He also had no doubt that the size of the college would begin to steadily increase to meet the needs of a new national population.<ref name=raymond1:145>Raymond (1907), p. 145, 147</ref>  But the only way for this to happen was through increased financial support from the state of New York, and Nott began the first of many complicated negotiations to endow the college with funds yielded by an education lottery, the first of which was authorized on March 30, 1805.<ref name=raymond1:140>Raymond (1907), p. 140</ref><ref name=sherwood205>Sherwood (1900), p. 205</ref>\n\n[[File:Joseph Ram\u00e9e Union College USA.jpg|thumb|left|The original 1813 Ram\u00e9e plan of the Union College campus]]\nAccordingly, in July 1806, Nott and the trustees determined to acquire a large tract of land to the east of the [[Downtown Schenectady]], on a gentle slope up from the Mohawk River and facing nearly due west. This tract was not promisingly described by Nott some years later as \"pasture grounds, scarred by deep ravines, rendered at once unsightly and difficult of access by an alternation of swamp and sand hill ...\".<ref name=sherwood206>Sherwood (1900), p. 206</ref>  Clearly, the prospect was largely in the eye of the beholder. There was apparently even a sulphur spring on the hill,<ref name=somers136>Somers (2003), p. 136</ref> although it did not pose any threat to [[Saratoga Springs#The Springs|Saratoga Springs]].  Using primarily his own funds and credit, Nott purchased between {{Convert|250|and|300|acre|ha}} of the hill.<ref name=somers135>Somers (2003), p. 135</ref><ref name=raymond1:147>Raymond (1907), p. 1:147</ref>  By 1812 a stone wall had been built at the lower end of the slope, creating a [[Terrace (agriculture)|terrace]] upon which the preliminary foundations for buildings were begun. Then a meeting occurred that changed not only the Union College campus, but many other American college designs for the next several decades.<ref name=turner68>Turner (1984), p. 68</ref>  The catalyst for this venture was international financier [[David Parish]].<ref name=turner189>Turner (1996), p. 189</ref>\n\nThe [[French people|French]] [[landscape architect|landscape]] and [[architect|building architect]], [[Joseph-Jacques Ram\u00e9e|Joseph Jacques Ram\u00e9e]] had already established a reputation as a skilled designer of landscapes combined with houses and other kinds of buildings by the time he was persuaded to visit America in search of projects. One of his projects had been the design of the estate of David Parish's father in [[Hamburg]], and Parish remembered this when he sought an architect to help him develop settlements on vast tracts of land in northern New York he had purchased on speculation.<ref name=tunnard7>Tunnard (1964), p. 7</ref>  Ram\u00e9e arrived in the northern Adirondacks in late 1812 to work on projects in and around the small towns on Parish's land. But not even the ambitious Parish could keep the famous architect busy enough to support his family, so Parish also acted as agent in finding Ram\u00e9e other work.<ref name=turner182>Turner (1996), p. 182</ref><ref name=tunnard10>Tunnard (1964), p. 10</ref>  So, it was natural that on a return trip to Philadelphia in January 1813, Parish should introduce Ram\u00e9e to Eliphalet Nott, who was already in the college building business. Nott hired Ram\u00e9e almost immediately to draw up plans for the new campus, for the fairly grand sum of $1,500 (roughly ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1500|1813|r=-2}}}} today).<ref name=tunnard10/>  Ram\u00e9e worked on the drawings for about a year,<ref name=turner68/> and construction of two of the college buildings proceeded quickly enough to permit occupation in 1814.<ref name=turner189/> The Union College campus thus became the first comprehensively planned college campus in the United States.<ref name=turner>Turner (1996), p. 190</ref>\n\n[[File:Unionaerial2.jpg|thumb|Aerial View of Union College, 1950]]\nWhile it would be many years before nearly all of the elements of Ram\u00e9e's original design were actually constructed, the plan itself, so to speak, broke new ground in college campus planning. On the terrace already prepared, the buildings were to be arranged to form a large, open courtyard, facing the West and the Mohawk River valley. The parallel buildings were {{Convert|600|ft|m}} apart and were all to be linked by [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]], one of which formed a [[semicircle]] at the upper end of the courtyard. In the center of the space a [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] was planned, probably meant to be the college chapel. It has been said that \"Ram\u00e9e's Union College plan is important for introducing a new type of planning, involving many buildings related in complex ways to each other and to the surrounding landscape. It is also a milestone in the history of the American college campus. The most ambitious and comprehensive plan for a campus up to that time, the Union design became a model for collegiate planning.\"<ref name=turner/>  It seems very likely, for example, that Thomas Jefferson was aware of the Ram\u00e9e design for Union, either directly or through the influence of [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe|Benjamin Latrobe]].<ref name=turner214>Turner (1996), p. 214</ref><ref name=wills49>Wills (2002), p. 49</ref>  Certainly the final design at the [[University of Virginia]] is reminiscent of Ram\u00e9e's overall conception in many ways.  Indeed, the plan that Nott and Ram\u00e9e imagined and realized in Schenectady eventually found its way into the design of other colleges and universities throughout the country.<ref name=tunnard10/><ref name=somers598>Somers (2003), p. 598</ref><ref name=turner216>Turner (1996), p. 216</ref><ref name=turner71>Turner (1984), p. 71</ref>\n\n===Landmarks===\n[[File:Arts Bldg angled.jpg|thumb|Arts Building]]\n[[File:Grant Hall 6.JPG|thumb|Grant Hall]]\n[[File:Memorial Chapel 6.JPG|thumb|Memorial Chapel]]\n[[File:Nott SE Landscape.JPG|thumb|[[Nott Memorial]]]]\n[[File:Reamer from grass (landscape).JPG|thumb|Reamer Campus Center]]\n[[File:Webster House 1.jpg|thumb|Webster House]]\n'''Arts Building''': The Arts building is located at the east end of the Taylor Music Center (the former North Colonnade) and was an element of the original campus plan by Joseph Jacques Ram\u00e9e. Built in 1852 and dedicated as Philosophical Hall, it housed the \"natural philosophy\" departments of today's physics and chemistry. Site of the first analytical chemistry laboratory in the nation, it remained home to the physics department remained for over 100 years, midway in which it was renamed the Physics building.<ref name=somers59>Somers (2003), p. 59</ref>\n\n'''Grant Hall''':  The former [[Alpha Delta Phi]] House was built for the fraternity between 1895 and 1898. It is the oldest surviving structure on campus originally constructed as a fraternity house and still has the [[Alpha Delta Phi]] crest on the front face of the building. Its architect, Albert W. Fuller, also designed several other buildings on campus. After the fraternity's lease on the land expired, the building was completely renovated by the college, and it reopened in the summer of 2001 as the Grant Admissions Center.<ref name=somers28>Somers (2003), p. 28</ref>\n\n'''Hale House''':  Often still called South Colonnade, this building was constructed in 1815 following the general design for the campus laid out by Ram\u00e9e. It originally contained recitation rooms and laboratories as well as faculty apartments. A gift from Walter C. Baker (class of 1915) and his wife allowed the building to be converted into a much-needed college dining hall with faculty and student lounges in 1935&ndash;1936. It was named in honor of Professor Edward Everett Hale, who had once lived in part of the building. It is currently used as a dining hall and meeting space for special events.<ref name=somers360>Somers (2003), p. 360</ref>\n\n'''Jackson's Garden''': Begun in the 1830s by Professor Isaac Jackson of the Mathematics Department, Jackson's Garden comprises {{Convert|8|acre|ha}} of formal gardens and woodlands. Sited where Ramee's original plans called for a garden, it initially featured a mix of vegetables, shrubs, and flowers \u2013 some of which were grown from seeds sent by botanists and botanical enthusiasts from around the world. As early as 1844 it drew the admiration of esteemed visitors such as [[John James Audubon]], and evolved into a sweeping retreat for both students and faculty.<ref name=somers411>Somers (2003), p. 411</ref>\n\n'''Lippman Hall''': Opened in 1967 as the Social Sciences building, today's Lippman Hall serves as one of the cornerstones of the liberal arts tradition at Union. Housing faculty offices and classrooms, the building is one of the most heavily used on campus. A lead gift in 2009 from Jim Lippman (1979) supported a major renovation.<ref name=\"lippmanhall\">{{cite web | url=http://www.union.edu/lippman-hall/ | title=Lippman Hall | publisher=Union College | accessdate=15 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n'''Memorial Chapel''': Memorial Chapel was constructed between 1924 and 1925 to serve as the central college chapel and to honor Union graduates who lost their lives serving during wartime. The names of Union alumni who died in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] appear on its south wall, flanked by portraits of college presidents.<ref name=somers486>Somers (2003), p. 486</ref>\n\n'''North and South College''': The first college buildings using Ram\u00e9e's plans, the pair were started in 1812 and occupied in 1814. Serving as dormitories, both buildings included faculty residences at each end until well into the 20th century.<ref name=somers505>Somers (2003), p. 505</ref>\n\n'''[[Nott Memorial]]''': Designed by Edward Tuckerman Potter (class of 1853), this building derived from the central rotunda in the original Ram\u00e9e Plan. While it was probably intended to be a chapel in its original conception, the Nott Memorial's primary purpose when finally built was aesthetic. It served as the library until 1961 when Schaffer Library was built. Its design bears some resemblance to the [[Radcliffe Camera]] at [[Oxford University]].

It was built between 1855 and 1856 according to plans developed by College President Eliphalet Nott and Treasurer Jonathan Pearson (class of 1835) in consultation with Albany architect William L. Woolett. Better known as Geological Hall throughout its early years, it did indeed contain the college's primary chapel until 1925, although the chapel was not formally laid out with its balconies and wood paneling until the 1870s.<ref name=somers311>Somers (2003), p. 331</ref>\n\n'''Reamer Campus Center''': Built in 1910 as the General Engineering Building with funds provided in part by [[Andrew Carnegie]], this building was home to the Civil Engineering Department and a variety of other academic departments until the 1970s. It was designed by Albert W. Fuller, the architect of a number of other buildings on campus. After 1971 it served as a student activity center, but it was not until a major reconstruction and expansion project in 1985 that it became a true College Center with numerous dining and lounge spaces, an outdoor plaza, an auditorium, meeting rooms, and offices for student-related services and organizations.<ref name=somers141>Somers (2003), p. 141</ref>\n\n'''[[#Schaffer Library|Schaffer Library]]''': Schaffer Library, erected in 1961, was the first building constructed at Union for the sole purpose of housing the college library. Trustee Henry Schaffer donated the majority of funds needed for its construction as well as for a later expansion between 1973 and 1974. The original building was designed by [[Walker O. Cain]] of [[McKim, Mead and White]] and built by the Hamilton Construction Company. Additional interior work supported by the Schaffer Foundation was done in the 1980s. After structural problems with the 1973&ndash;1974 addition developed, a major project to renovate and expand the library was undertaken in the late 1990s. Designed by the firm of [[Perry Dean Rogers Architects|Perry, Dean, Rogers and Partners]], the renovation provided space for College Media Services, Writing Center, and a language lab.<ref name=somers627>Somers (2003), p. 627</ref>\n\n'''Webster House''': Webster House was built between 1901 and 1903 to house the Schenectady Public Library on land that had been purchased from the college. Its construction was financed in part by Andrew Carnegie, making it one of over 2,500 [[Carnegie Library|Carnegie Libraries]] throughout the world, including Union's own college library at the time. [[General Electric]] also contributed funds towards its construction. Union repurchased the building and land in 1970 after the public library moved to a larger facility in the city. For several years the space was used for student and other organizations. It was renovated into a dormitory in 1973 and named for College President Harrison Webster (class of 1868 and President 1884&ndash;1894).<ref name=somers786>Somers (2003), p. 786</ref>\n\n==Organization and administration==\n\n=== Board of Trustees ===\n\"The Trustees of Union College\", as a corporate body, has owned the college and been the college's designated legal representative throughout its history.<ref name=somers745>Somers (2003), p. 745</ref> The Board consists of four life trustees, twenty-one term trustees, four alumni trustees, two faculty trustees, two student trustees, and the president of the college. The governor of the state of New York is also an ''ex officio'' member. The Board meets three times annually: in February, May, and October. The Board appoints the president of the college upon vacancy of the position.<ref>{{cite web |title=Union College, Board of Trustees| url = http://www.union.edu/about/leadership/trustees/index.php | accessdate = 2010-09-30}}</ref>\n\n=== Administration and faculty ===\nThe active administration of Union College consists of the president; vice-presidents for student affairs, college relations, academic affairs, administration and finance, and admissions, financial aid and Enrollment; Chief of Staff, Senior Director for Diversity and Affirmative Action and deans and directors of subsidiary departments, including the academic departments, interdisciplinary studies, engineering, advising, health professions, information technology services, athletics, and the library.<ref>''Union College Organization Chart'', Sept. 2008</ref>\n\nThe general faculty includes all full-time members of the teaching faculty, professional librarians, and part-time faculty teaching at least four courses during the academic year.

These include the habits and skills of critical inquiry, a tolerance for diverse points of view, an awareness of ambiguity, and a deep curiosity about the social, ethical, cultural, political, and natural world in which we live.

Since then, undergraduate research has taken hold in all disciplines at the college, making this endeavor what has been termed \"the [[:wiktionary:linchpin|linchpin]]\" of the Union education. By the mid-1960s several disciplines at Union had established a senior research thesis requirement, and in 1978 the college began funding faculty-mentored student research in all disciplines. This was followed by the creation of funded summer research opportunities, again in all disciplines at the college, in 1986.\nExamples of possible programs include summer undergraduate research, in which students are supported each summer by the college on independent projects with a sponsoring faculty member; the [[National Conference on Undergraduate Research]], to which Union sends one of the largest contingents to its national conference each year where the students present their work and interact with peers from colleges and universities across the country; general internships at such nearby sites as [[GE Global Research|General Electric's Global Research Center]]; and the Steinmetz Symposium day. On a Friday in May, over 300 students, previously carrying out research within the past year, present their research and projects to their fellow students, teachers, staff, and visitors. Students also have the school day off, and presentations take form in slideshows, performances, lectures, and many other creative forms.<ref>{{cite web |title=Undergraduate Research |publisher=Union College |url=http://www.union.edu/Resources/Academic/undergrad_research/index.php |accessdate=2009-08-31}}</ref>\n\n===Study abroad programs===\nUnion College makes available a variety of opportunities for formal study outside the United States, the most popular of which are the Terms Abroad Programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.union.edu/offices/international/|title=International Programs              - Union College|publisher=|accessdate=7 December 2016}}</ref>  Currently, Terms Abroad are offered for residence and study on nearly every continent, some in cooperation with [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges]].

Three other surviving national fraternities \u2013 [[Psi Upsilon]] (1833), [[Chi Psi]] (1841), and [[Theta Delta Chi]] (1847) \u2013 were founded at Union in the next two decades; on account of this fecundity, Union would in the twentieth century call itself the '[[Mother of Fraternities]]'.<ref name=\"somers304\"/>  As with most historical generalizations, this one requires qualification. What does seem true is that Union's claim to priority is that the oldest secret Greek letter social fraternity with a continuing record was founded at the college. None of the early societies at Union or elsewhere can precisely challenge the claim of Union's Sigma Phi, which became the first national fraternity with the founding of a second chapter at Hamilton College in 1831,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sigmaphi.org/?page=History|title=History of the Sigma Phi - Sigma Phi Society|publisher=|accessdate=7 December 2016}}</ref> but the founders of the first fraternities at Union were obviously imitating or improving upon existing models.

Founded in 1795, it was the first institution of higher learning chartered by the [[New York State Board of Regents]].  In the 19th century, it became the \"[[Mother of Fraternities]]\",<ref name=somers304>Somers (2003), p. 304</ref> as three of the earliest [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|such organizations]] were established there.  After 175 years as a traditional all-male institution, Union College began enrolling women in 1970.\n\nThe college offers a [[liberal arts]] curriculum across some 21 academic departments, as well as opportunities for interdepartmental [[Academic major|major]]s and self-designed organizing theme majors. In common with most liberal arts colleges, Union offers a wide array of courses in arts, sciences, literature, and foreign languages, but, in common with only a few other liberal arts colleges, Union also offers [[ABET|ABET-accredited]] undergraduate degrees in [[computer engineering]], [[bioengineering]], [[electrical engineering]], and [[mechanical engineering]]. By the time they graduate, about 60% of Union students will have engaged in some form of international study or [[study abroad]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Union College Office of Institutional Studies |url=http://www.union.edu/Resources/Campus/institutional_studies/index.php |accessdate=2009-09-21|year=2008}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Founding===\n[[File:Union1795nocap.jpg|thumb|border|left|The Schenectady Academy (Old Union College), 1795]]\n\nChartered in 1795,<ref name=fortenbaugh3>Fortenbaugh (1978), p. 3</ref> Union was one the first [[non-denominational]] institutions of [[higher education]] in the United States, and the second college established in the [[State of New York]].\n\nFrom 1636 to 1769, only nine institutions of [[higher education]] were founded on a permanent basis in [[Colonial America]].{{Ref label|a|a|none}} Most had been founded in association with British religious denominations devoted to the perpetuation of their respective Christian denominations.,<ref name=\"Tewksbury 1932, p. 59\">Tewksbury (1932), p. 59</ref> Union College was to be founded with a broader ecumenical basis.\n\nOnly [[Columbia University]] (the successor of King's College, founded in 1754),<ref>{{cite book |  year = 1902 | title = A History of Columbia University, 1754\u20131904 | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York | page = 1}}</ref> had preceded Union in New York. Twenty-five years later impetus for another institution grew.  Certain that [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[John Burgoyne]]'s defeat at the [[Battle of Saratoga]] in 1777 would mean a new nation, nearly 1,000 citizens of [[upstate New York|northern New York]] (which then included what eventually became [[Vermont]]) began the first popular demand for higher education in America.<ref name=fox10>Fox (1945), p. 10</ref> As a democratic cultural changes rose and began to become dominant<ref name=rudoloph34>Rudolph (1965), p. 34</ref> old ways, in particular the old purposes and structure of higher education, were being pushed aside.<ref name=boorstin153>Boorstin (1965), p. 153</ref>\n\n[[Schenectady]], originally a Mohawk outpost, was a city founded and dominated by people originating from the [[Netherlands]], with about 4,000 residents,<ref name=\"Somers 2003, p. 296\">Somers (2003), p. 296</ref>. It was the third largest city in the state, after [[Albany, New York|Albany]] and [[New York City]]. The [[Dutch Reformed Church]], began to show an interest in establishing an academy or college under its control there. In 1778, the Schenectady Dutch Reformed Church invited the Rev. Dirck Romeyn of [[New Jersey]] to visit.<ref name=pearson119>Pearson (1880/1980), p. 119</ref> Returning home, he authored a plan in 1782 for such an institution, and was summoned two years later<ref name=fortenbaugh36>Fortenbaugh (1978), p. 36</ref> to finally come help found it.\n\nThe Schenectady Academy was established in 1785 as the city's first organized school.<ref name=Neisular20>Neisular (1964), p. 20</ref> It immediately flourished, reaching an enrollment of about 100 within a year.  By at least 1792 it offered a full four-year college course, as well as one of elementary and practical subjects taught mainly to girls.<ref name=somers629>Somers (2003), p. 629</ref> Attempts to charter the Academy as a college with the [[University of the State of New York|Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York]] in 1786, 1792, and 1793 were rejected<ref name=\"Somers 2003, p. 296\"/> on the grounds the school was not yet either academically or financially qualified.<ref name=hough146>Hough (1885), p. 146</ref>\n\nThe following year the school reapplied, as \"Union College\", a name chosen to reflect the resolution that the school should be free of any specific religious affiliation.<ref name=raymond1:34>Raymond (1907), p. 1:34</ref>  The resulting institution was awarded its charter on February 25, 1795 &ndash; still celebrated by the College as \"Founders' Day\".<ref name=yates423>Yates (1902), p. 423</ref>\n\n===Seals and mottos===\n[[File:SealUnionUniversity.jpg|thumb|The Seal of [[Union University (New York)|Union University]] on the Exterior Wall of the [[University Club of New York]] in Manhattan]]\n[[File:Minervaliberty.jpg|thumb|''[[Minerva]] as the Patroness of American Liberty'' (1791) by [[Giuseppe Ceracchi]]]]\n\nThe College's charter provided for the design of an official [[Seal (impression)|seal]] to be used on [[diploma]]s and other official business documents and correspondence. The Trustees were also authorized to select the \"devices and inscription\" to be engraved on the seal.<ref name=raymond1:38>Raymond (1907), p. 1:38</ref>  A committee of four Trustees was appointed to look into the matter, and a seal was approved in November 1796. The original seal and its press have been lost, but it is known that it was nearly identical to the seal in use today (from an impression on a document from 1796).<ref name=fortenbaugh74>Fortenbaugh (1978), p. 74</ref>\n\nThe Union College seal combines ancient and modern elements in balanced proportions. The head of the [[Roman goddess]] [[Minerva]] ([[Greek goddess]] [[Athena]]) appears in the center of an oval with an outside star pattern surrounding the whole.  Around the central figure are the [[French language|French]] words ''\"Sous les lois de Minerve nous devenons tous fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs\"'' ({{lang-en|Under the laws of Minerva, we all become brothers and sisters}}).<ref name=fortenbaugh73>Fortenbaugh (1978), p. 73</ref>  Originally, the motto ended with the [[French language|French]] word ''\"fr\u00e8res\"'' ({{lang-en|brothers}}), but in 2015 the College modified the motto to add the [[French language|French]] words ''\"et s\u0153urs\"'' ({{lang-en|and sisters}}).<ref name=sisters>{{cite web|title= Union's age-old motto gets a modern makeover|url=https://www.union.edu/news/stories/2015/11/unions-age-old-motto-gets-a-modern-makeover.php|accessdate=23 July 2018}}</ref> On a banner just above the central figure are the words ''\"St: of N: York\"'' and on a similar banner below the central figure appear the words: ''\"Union College 1795\"''. The precise origins of the motto and the choice of Minerva as the fundamental element of the College seal are obscure, but two things are certain: like most colleges of the time, Union was deeply rooted in the classical tradition, but, unlike most colleges, Union chose a modern language rather than [[Latin]] for its motto. The resulting tone of the entire seal is thus historically aware, but distinctly modern in outlook.<ref name=somers636>Somers (2003), p. 636; See also Fortenbaugh, ''passim''.</ref>\n\nIt is not at all surprising that the original trustees should have chosen Minerva as their herald and representative. Minerva began her mythological career as a local Italian deity ([[Etruscan mythology|Etruscan]], but possibly with Greek influences), patroness of the arts and crafts.<ref name=altheim265>Altheim (1938), p. 265</ref>  By the time she was well established as a Roman goddess, the scope of her interests and patronage had broadened to include at least painting, poetry, drama, and teaching. Somewhat paradoxically, Minerva was also associated with the arts of war\u2014hence her image is usually that of a female dressed for battle.<ref name=smith2:1090>Smith (1867), p. 1:1090</ref>  Very early, Minerva was identified with the Greek goddess Athena, and invested with many of that deity's characteristics and iconography.<ref name=fowler234>Fowler (1911), p. 234</ref>  Eventually\u2014certainly by the 18th century\u2014Minerva had come to represent all of those qualities that might be wished for in a rational, virtuous, prudent, wise, and \"scientific\" man: just the sort of progressive individual who might found a new nation (or college) based on sound republican principles and liberal Christian (Protestant) morals.<ref name=king123>King (1750), p. 123</ref>  When the [[French Academy of Sciences|Paris Academy of Sciences]] met for the first time in 1666, a commemorative medal was struck portraying Minerva on its reverse, surrounded by symbols of astronomy, anatomy, and chemistry.<ref name=hahn4>Hahn (1971), p. 4</ref>  The [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], founded in 1780, took Minerva as its model, along with the motto ''\"Sub libertate florent\"'', intending to imply that the arts and sciences flourish best in a free society.<ref>{{cite book | year = 1785 | title = Memoirs of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences | publisher = Adams and Nourse | location = Boston | page = 1:638}}</ref>  Clearly, Minerva was very much an icon of the [[Scientific Revolution]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].\n\nWhile the rationale behind the connection between Union College and Minerva is relatively clear, there is less agreement with respect to the history of the College's motto.<ref name=somers636/>  Its egalitarian theme is consistent with the non-denominational and generally democratic spirit of Union's founding. It also declares the brotherhood of man, or of the community of mankind, in a sense familiar to the Enlightenment (and, of course, to the French revolutionaries). But that it does so with the qualification \"under the laws of Minerva\" is important.<ref name=somers637>Somers (2003), p. 637</ref>  Even though Minerva was a pagan goddess, and the Union College founders devout Protestants, there was still plenty of room for a belief that men could come together as brothers in a community ruled by reason, virtue, and [[natural law]] (or, as the case may be, the [[Law of God]]). The Latin motto on the seal of Union University supports this argument: ''In necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas'' (English: Unity in necessary matters, freedom in doubtful matters, charity for all). An institution of higher learning fosters unity of purpose (hence \"brotherhood\"), but not always unity of opinion, hence the freedom to disagree. The \"laws of Minerva\" enjoin rational thought rather than obligatory doctrine. Not surprisingly, the founders believed that the key to achieving this ideal state is education.  Nearly all of the differences among human beings, wherever they may be found, argued [[John Locke]], are the result of diverse education.<ref name=locke2>Locke (1764), p. 2</ref>  The founders of Union College were unabashedly optimistic that education, learning, and science could build a better world.\n\n===Presidents===\n{{multiple image  | align     = right  | direction = horizontal  | image1    = Nott2.jpg  | width1    = 175  | alt1      =  | caption1  = [[Eliphalet Nott]], president 1804&ndash;1866  | image2    = Stephen Ainlay crop.jpeg  | width2    = 182  | alt2      =  | caption2  = Stephen Ainlay, president 2006-2018 }}\nUnion College has had nineteen presidents since its founding in 1795.

[[Arithmetic]], [[geometry]], and [[calculus]] (\"[[Method of Fluxions|fluxions]]\") gave some practical application in [[navigation]] and [[surveying]].  [[Astronomy]], [[chemistry]], and [[natural philosophy]] ([[physics]]) rounded out the study of science. Finally, [[theology]] and [[moral philosophy]] as capstone subjects typically dominated much of the junior and senior years.  [[Wikt:elective#Noun|Elective]]s were essentially unheard of.<ref>{{cite book | year = 1825 | title = The Laws of Yale College | publisher = The Journal Office | location = New Haven | page = 16}}; {{cite book | year = 1821 | title = Laws of Union College | publisher = Isaac Riggs | location = Schenectady | page = 25}}; {{cite book | year = 1830 | title = Catalogue of the Officers and Students of the College of New Jersey | publisher = George Sherman | location = Trenton | page = 10}}</ref>  But by the 1820s all of this began to change.<ref name=rudolph113>Rudolph (1965), p. 113</ref>\n\nAlthough [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] remained a part of the curriculum (and do so to this day), new subjects were adopted that offered more readily apparent application to the busy commercial life of the new nation. Accordingly, French was gradually introduced into the college curriculum, sometimes as a substitute for Greek or [[Hebrew]].<ref name=rudolph51>Rudolph (1977), p. 51</ref> It is significant in this context that French was chosen for the Union College motto. By the second decade of the 19th century, calls for reform in higher education, especially in the traditional liberal arts colleges, were becoming increasingly demanding; a response was required if many of these institutions were to survive at all. The classical curriculum somehow needed to accommodate the needs of a practical, utilitarian, and egalitarian nation as it confronted its [[manifest destiny]] to conquer not only geography but nature itself. One solution to this problem was the so-called \"parallel course of study\" in scientific and \"literary\" subjects.<ref name=butts129>Butts (1939), p. 129</ref>  The basic idea was to offer a scientific curriculum in parallel to the classical curriculum, for those students wishing a more modern treatment of modern languages, mathematics, and science, equal in dignity to the traditional course of study.<ref name=Rudolph114>Rudolph (1965), p. 114</ref>  An early attempt to establish such a parallel scientific course was made by [[Hobart and William Smith College|Hobart College]] in [[Geneva, New York|Geneva]], New York, when it was founded in 1825, so that at least some students could get on with the \"practical business of life...without passing through a tedious course of classical studies.\"<ref name=hislop582n23>Hislop (1971), p. 582n23</ref>  But this experiment at Hobart soon languished, partly for lack of support by President [[Jasper Adams]]<ref name=adams32>Adams (1827), p. 32</ref> and partly for lack of funds.<ref name=butts135>Butts (1939), p. 135</ref>  A similar experiment launched by Union College in 1828 was to fare much better.\n\nIt was the [[Hudson Valley]] that gave birth to \u2013 and nurtured \u2013 the first successful attempts in America to raise applied science and technology to a collegiate level. The first technical college in the United States, [[United States Military Academy|the military academy at West Point]], was created by [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1802.<ref name=Rudolph62>Rudolph (1977), p. 62</ref>  The institution that eventually became [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] (RPI) was founded in [[Troy, New York|Troy]], New York, in 1824 and incorporated in 1826 (and of which Union College president Eliphalet Nott was also president from 1829 to 1845).<ref name=sherwood484492>Sherwood (1900), pp. 484, 492</ref>  Union College introduced a parallel scientific curriculum in 1828 and a [[civil engineering]] program in 1845.<ref name=hough160>Hough (1885), p. 160</ref>  Union College, it has been said, was the \"one traditional liberal arts college in the first half of the nineteenth century to make a thoroughly uncompromising and effective place for applied science in the course of study\".<ref name=rudolph63>Rudolph (1977), p. 63</ref>  In fact, so successful were Union's reform efforts that by 1839 the College had one of the largest faculty in American higher education and an enrollment surpassed only by [[Yale University|Yale]].<ref name=guralnick38>Guralnick (1975), p. 38</ref>\n\n==Campus==\n\n===Architecture and design===\n[[File:Union1804.jpg|thumb|Union College's first home, an 1804 design built prior to the cohesive Ram\u00e9e-designed campus]]\n\nAfter Union College received its charter in 1795, it was quite natural that the college should carry on business in the same building already occupied by the Schenectady Academy. The college began conducting classes on the upper floor, while a [[grammar school]] continued to be conducted on the lower floor.<ref name=somers630>Somers (2003), p. 630</ref>  It soon became clear that this space would prove inadequate for the growing college (or at least for the optimistic plans of the founders). In 1796, the state of New York appropriated $10,000 (roughly ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|10000|1800}}}} today) for a new building, and construction began two years later on the edge of the original Schenectady town site.<ref name=hough154>Hough (1885), p. 154</ref> The ground plan of the new buildings was to be {{Convert|150|by|60|ft|m}}, the superstructure rising three stories, topped by a [[cupola]].<ref name=hough155n>Hough (1885), p. 155n</ref>  There is reason to believe that the design of the building was influenced by that of [[Princeton University|Princeton]]'s [[Nassau Hall]] (sometimes described as the [[Italianate architecture|Italianate style]]).<ref name=somers789>Somers (2003), p. 789</ref>  The new building was occupied in 1804, despite continuing financial difficulties, and two dormitories were constructed nearby.\n\nHowever, Eliphalet Nott, arriving as president of the college in 1804 (having been a trustee since 1800) was not daunted by the obstacles to growth and expansion created by lack of funds, a reluctant [[New York State Legislature|legislature]], and a sometimes litigious Board of Trustees. Even as the booming city of Schenectady was alive with commercial activity,<ref name=hislop139>Hislop (1971), p. 139</ref> Nott was envisioning a college that would to a large extent protect and shield its students from the lowlife and temptations that inevitably accompanied rapid economic growth on the frontier. He also had no doubt that the size of the college would begin to steadily increase to meet the needs of a new national population.<ref name=raymond1:145>Raymond (1907), p. 145, 147</ref>  But the only way for this to happen was through increased financial support from the state of New York, and Nott began the first of many complicated negotiations to endow the college with funds yielded by an education lottery, the first of which was authorized on March 30, 1805.<ref name=raymond1:140>Raymond (1907), p. 140</ref><ref name=sherwood205>Sherwood (1900), p. 205</ref>\n\n[[File:Joseph Ram\u00e9e Union College USA.jpg|thumb|left|The original 1813 Ram\u00e9e plan of the Union College campus]]\nAccordingly, in July 1806, Nott and the trustees determined to acquire a large tract of land to the east of the [[Downtown Schenectady]], on a gentle slope up from the Mohawk River and facing nearly due west. This tract was not promisingly described by Nott some years later as \"pasture grounds, scarred by deep ravines, rendered at once unsightly and difficult of access by an alternation of swamp and sand hill ...\".<ref name=sherwood206>Sherwood (1900), p. 206</ref>  Clearly, the prospect was largely in the eye of the beholder. There was apparently even a sulphur spring on the hill,<ref name=somers136>Somers (2003), p. 136</ref> although it did not pose any threat to [[Saratoga Springs#The Springs|Saratoga Springs]].  Using primarily his own funds and credit, Nott purchased between {{Convert|250|and|300|acre|ha}} of the hill.<ref name=somers135>Somers (2003), p. 135</ref><ref name=raymond1:147>Raymond (1907), p. 1:147</ref>  By 1812 a stone wall had been built at the lower end of the slope, creating a [[Terrace (agriculture)|terrace]] upon which the preliminary foundations for buildings were begun. Then a meeting occurred that changed not only the Union College campus, but many other American college designs for the next several decades.<ref name=turner68>Turner (1984), p. 68</ref>  The catalyst for this venture was international financier [[David Parish]].<ref name=turner189>Turner (1996), p. 189</ref>\n\nThe [[French people|French]] [[landscape architect|landscape]] and [[architect|building architect]], [[Joseph-Jacques Ram\u00e9e|Joseph Jacques Ram\u00e9e]] had already established a reputation as a skilled designer of landscapes combined with houses and other kinds of buildings by the time he was persuaded to visit America in search of projects. One of his projects had been the design of the estate of David Parish's father in [[Hamburg]], and Parish remembered this when he sought an architect to help him develop settlements on vast tracts of land in northern New York he had purchased on speculation.<ref name=tunnard7>Tunnard (1964), p. 7</ref>  Ram\u00e9e arrived in the northern Adirondacks in late 1812 to work on projects in and around the small towns on Parish's land. But not even the ambitious Parish could keep the famous architect busy enough to support his family, so Parish also acted as agent in finding Ram\u00e9e other work.<ref name=turner182>Turner (1996), p. 182</ref><ref name=tunnard10>Tunnard (1964), p. 10</ref>  So, it was natural that on a return trip to Philadelphia in January 1813, Parish should introduce Ram\u00e9e to Eliphalet Nott, who was already in the college building business. Nott hired Ram\u00e9e almost immediately to draw up plans for the new campus, for the fairly grand sum of $1,500 (roughly ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1500|1813|r=-2}}}} today).<ref name=tunnard10/>  Ram\u00e9e worked on the drawings for about a year,<ref name=turner68/> and construction of two of the college buildings proceeded quickly enough to permit occupation in 1814.<ref name=turner189/> The Union College campus thus became the first comprehensively planned college campus in the United States.<ref name=turner>Turner (1996), p. 190</ref>\n\n[[File:Unionaerial2.jpg|thumb|Aerial View of Union College, 1950]]\nWhile it would be many years before nearly all of the elements of Ram\u00e9e's original design were actually constructed, the plan itself, so to speak, broke new ground in college campus planning. On the terrace already prepared, the buildings were to be arranged to form a large, open courtyard, facing the West and the Mohawk River valley. The parallel buildings were {{Convert|600|ft|m}} apart and were all to be linked by [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]], one of which formed a [[semicircle]] at the upper end of the courtyard. In the center of the space a [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] was planned, probably meant to be the college chapel. It has been said that \"Ram\u00e9e's Union College plan is important for introducing a new type of planning, involving many buildings related in complex ways to each other and to the surrounding landscape. It is also a milestone in the history of the American college campus. The most ambitious and comprehensive plan for a campus up to that time, the Union design became a model for collegiate planning.\"<ref name=turner/>  It seems very likely, for example, that Thomas Jefferson was aware of the Ram\u00e9e design for Union, either directly or through the influence of [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe|Benjamin Latrobe]].<ref name=turner214>Turner (1996), p. 214</ref><ref name=wills49>Wills (2002), p. 49</ref>  Certainly the final design at the [[University of Virginia]] is reminiscent of Ram\u00e9e's overall conception in many ways.  Indeed, the plan that Nott and Ram\u00e9e imagined and realized in Schenectady eventually found its way into the design of other colleges and universities throughout the country.<ref name=tunnard10/><ref name=somers598>Somers (2003), p. 598</ref><ref name=turner216>Turner (1996), p. 216</ref><ref name=turner71>Turner (1984), p. 71</ref>\n\n===Landmarks===\n[[File:Arts Bldg angled.jpg|thumb|Arts Building]]\n[[File:Grant Hall 6.JPG|thumb|Grant Hall]]\n[[File:Memorial Chapel 6.JPG|thumb|Memorial Chapel]]\n[[File:Nott SE Landscape.JPG|thumb|[[Nott Memorial]]]]\n[[File:Reamer from grass (landscape).JPG|thumb|Reamer Campus Center]]\n[[File:Webster House 1.jpg|thumb|Webster House]]\n'''Arts Building''': The Arts building is located at the east end of the Taylor Music Center (the former North Colonnade) and was an element of the original campus plan by Joseph Jacques Ram\u00e9e. Built in 1852 and dedicated as Philosophical Hall, it housed the \"natural philosophy\" departments of today's physics and chemistry. Site of the first analytical chemistry laboratory in the nation, it remained home to the physics department remained for over 100 years, midway in which it was renamed the Physics building.<ref name=somers59>Somers (2003), p. 59</ref>\n\n'''Grant Hall''':  The former [[Alpha Delta Phi]] House was built for the fraternity between 1895 and 1898. It is the oldest surviving structure on campus originally constructed as a fraternity house and still has the [[Alpha Delta Phi]] crest on the front face of the building. Its architect, Albert W. Fuller, also designed several other buildings on campus. After the fraternity's lease on the land expired, the building was completely renovated by the college, and it reopened in the summer of 2001 as the Grant Admissions Center.<ref name=somers28>Somers (2003), p. 28</ref>\n\n'''Hale House''':  Often still called South Colonnade, this building was constructed in 1815 following the general design for the campus laid out by Ram\u00e9e. It originally contained recitation rooms and laboratories as well as faculty apartments. A gift from Walter C. Baker (class of 1915) and his wife allowed the building to be converted into a much-needed college dining hall with faculty and student lounges in 1935&ndash;1936. It was named in honor of Professor Edward Everett Hale, who had once lived in part of the building. It is currently used as a dining hall and meeting space for special events.<ref name=somers360>Somers (2003), p. 360</ref>\n\n'''Jackson's Garden''': Begun in the 1830s by Professor Isaac Jackson of the Mathematics Department, Jackson's Garden comprises {{Convert|8|acre|ha}} of formal gardens and woodlands. Sited where Ramee's original plans called for a garden, it initially featured a mix of vegetables, shrubs, and flowers \u2013 some of which were grown from seeds sent by botanists and botanical enthusiasts from around the world. As early as 1844 it drew the admiration of esteemed visitors such as [[John James Audubon]], and evolved into a sweeping retreat for both students and faculty.<ref name=somers411>Somers (2003), p. 411</ref>\n\n'''Lippman Hall''': Opened in 1967 as the Social Sciences building, today's Lippman Hall serves as one of the cornerstones of the liberal arts tradition at Union. Housing faculty offices and classrooms, the building is one of the most heavily used on campus. A lead gift in 2009 from Jim Lippman (1979) supported a major renovation.<ref name=\"lippmanhall\">{{cite web | url=http://www.union.edu/lippman-hall/ | title=Lippman Hall | publisher=Union College | accessdate=15 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n'''Memorial Chapel''': Memorial Chapel was constructed between 1924 and 1925 to serve as the central college chapel and to honor Union graduates who lost their lives serving during wartime. The names of Union alumni who died in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] appear on its south wall, flanked by portraits of college presidents.<ref name=somers486>Somers (2003), p. 486</ref>\n\n'''North and South College''': The first college buildings using Ram\u00e9e's plans, the pair were started in 1812 and occupied in 1814. Serving as dormitories, both buildings included faculty residences at each end until well into the 20th century.<ref name=somers505>Somers (2003), p. 505</ref>\n\n'''[[Nott Memorial]]''': Designed by Edward Tuckerman Potter (class of 1853), this building derived from the central rotunda in the original Ram\u00e9e Plan. While it was probably intended to be a chapel in its original conception, the Nott Memorial's primary purpose when finally built was aesthetic. It served as the library until 1961 when Schaffer Library was built. Its design bears some resemblance to the [[Radcliffe Camera]] at [[Oxford University]].

It was built between 1855 and 1856 according to plans developed by College President Eliphalet Nott and Treasurer Jonathan Pearson (class of 1835) in consultation with Albany architect William L. Woolett. Better known as Geological Hall throughout its early years, it did indeed contain the college's primary chapel until 1925, although the chapel was not formally laid out with its balconies and wood paneling until the 1870s.<ref name=somers311>Somers (2003), p. 331</ref>\n\n'''Reamer Campus Center''': Built in 1910 as the General Engineering Building with funds provided in part by [[Andrew Carnegie]], this building was home to the Civil Engineering Department and a variety of other academic departments until the 1970s. It was designed by Albert W. Fuller, the architect of a number of other buildings on campus. After 1971 it served as a student activity center, but it was not until a major reconstruction and expansion project in 1985 that it became a true College Center with numerous dining and lounge spaces, an outdoor plaza, an auditorium, meeting rooms, and offices for student-related services and organizations.<ref name=somers141>Somers (2003), p. 141</ref>\n\n'''[[#Schaffer Library|Schaffer Library]]''': Schaffer Library, erected in 1961, was the first building constructed at Union for the sole purpose of housing the college library. Trustee Henry Schaffer donated the majority of funds needed for its construction as well as for a later expansion between 1973 and 1974. The original building was designed by [[Walker O. Cain]] of [[McKim, Mead and White]] and built by the Hamilton Construction Company. Additional interior work supported by the Schaffer Foundation was done in the 1980s. After structural problems with the 1973&ndash;1974 addition developed, a major project to renovate and expand the library was undertaken in the late 1990s. Designed by the firm of [[Perry Dean Rogers Architects|Perry, Dean, Rogers and Partners]], the renovation provided space for College Media Services, Writing Center, and a language lab.<ref name=somers627>Somers (2003), p. 627</ref>\n\n'''Webster House''': Webster House was built between 1901 and 1903 to house the Schenectady Public Library on land that had been purchased from the college. Its construction was financed in part by Andrew Carnegie, making it one of over 2,500 [[Carnegie Library|Carnegie Libraries]] throughout the world, including Union's own college library at the time. [[General Electric]] also contributed funds towards its construction. Union repurchased the building and land in 1970 after the public library moved to a larger facility in the city. For several years the space was used for student and other organizations. It was renovated into a dormitory in 1973 and named for College President Harrison Webster (class of 1868 and President 1884&ndash;1894).<ref name=somers786>Somers (2003), p. 786</ref>\n\n==Organization and administration==\n\n=== Board of Trustees ===\n\"The Trustees of Union College\", as a corporate body, has owned the college and been the college's designated legal representative throughout its history.<ref name=somers745>Somers (2003), p. 745</ref> The Board consists of four life trustees, twenty-one term trustees, four alumni trustees, two faculty trustees, two student trustees, and the president of the college. The governor of the state of New York is also an ''ex officio'' member. The Board meets three times annually: in February, May, and October. The Board appoints the president of the college upon vacancy of the position.<ref>{{cite web |title=Union College, Board of Trustees| url = http://www.union.edu/about/leadership/trustees/index.php | accessdate = 2010-09-30}}</ref>\n\n=== Administration and faculty ===\nThe active administration of Union College consists of the president; vice-presidents for student affairs, college relations, academic affairs, administration and finance, and admissions, financial aid and Enrollment; Chief of Staff, Senior Director for Diversity and Affirmative Action and deans and directors of subsidiary departments, including the academic departments, interdisciplinary studies, engineering, advising, health professions, information technology services, athletics, and the library.<ref>''Union College Organization Chart'', Sept. 2008</ref>\n\nThe general faculty includes all full-time members of the teaching faculty, professional librarians, and part-time faculty teaching at least four courses during the academic year. Leadership of the general faculty is assigned to a Faculty Executive Committee (FEC), consisting of a chair, a secretary, and four additional faculty members elected by each of the four academic divisions (humanities, social sciences, sciences and mathematics, and engineering).<ref>{{cite web | title = Union College Faculty Manual | url = http://www.union.edu/Academics/AcademicAffairs/GovernanceCommittees/FacultyManual/index.php| accessdate = 2009-11-13}}\n</ref>\n\n=== The Student Forum ===\nThe Student Forum represents the principal form of student government at Union College. The purpose of the Student Forum is to consider issues and to review, recommend, or formulate policies (as appropriate) in areas involving the student body. In many ways, the structure of student government at Union College deliberately mirrors the structure of college government. The student body is represented by a president, vice-president of administration, vice-president of finance, vice-president of academics, vice-president of campus life, and vice-president for multicultural affairs. The entire Student Forum includes these officers together with two student trustees and 12 class representatives.<ref>{{cite web | title = Union College Student Forum | url = http://www.union.edu/StudentLife/Student_Activities/student_forum/index.php| accessdate = 2009-11-13}}\n</ref>\n\n=== Memberships and affiliations ===\nUnion College belongs to the [[Liberty League]], [[ECAC Hockey]], the [[Annapolis Group]], the [[Oberlin Group]], the [[Consortium of Liberal Arts Colleges]] (CLAC), and the New York Six Consortium.<ref>{{cite web | title = Union and other colleges form New York Six Consortium | url = http://www.union.edu/N/DS/s.php?s=8510| accessdate = 2009-11-13}}\n</ref>  Union is also a component of [[Union University (New York)|Union University]], which includes the [[Union Graduate College]], [[Albany Medical College]], [[Albany Law School]], the [[Dudley Observatory]], and the [[Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Union  University | url = http://www.union.edu/Academics/UnionUniversity/| accessdate = 2009-11-13}}\n</ref>\n\n=== Student media ===\nThe Union College radio station, [[WRUC]] 89.7,  dates from a student project in fall, 1910, but did not become \"live\" until 1912.<ref name=somers593>Somers (2003), p. 593</ref>  The Union College radio station was among the very first wireless transmitters in the country to broadcast regularly scheduled programs.<ref name=somers594>Somers (2003), p. 594</ref>  The weekly ''[[Concordiensis]]'', the principal newspaper of Union College since 1877, is the thirteenth oldest student newspaper in the United States and the oldest continuously published newspaper in Schenectady.<ref name=somers184>Somers (2003), p. 184</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n\n[[File:Union Library Lane 2.JPG|thumb|[[Nott Memorial]] viewed from the south]]\n\nThe mission statement of Union College<ref>{{cite web |title=About Union: The Mission of the College |publisher=Union College |date=2008-05-31|accessdate=2010-09-30|url=http://www.union.edu/about/mission/index.php}}</ref> claims, in part, that Union will offer a liberal education that includes \"a wide range of disciplines and interdisciplinary programs in the liberal arts and engineering, as well as academic, athletic, cultural, and social activities, including opportunities to study abroad and to participate in undergraduate research and community service.\" The general education program and the requirements of the major are an essential component of this mission.<ref>{{cite book | title = Union College Academic Register, 2008\u20132009 |publisher= Union College | pages = 4\u20137}}</ref> In addition to a standard distribution requirement of courses in several disciplines, the general education curriculum includes two specially designed, required courses intended to develop critical reading and writing skills across the first two years of college:  the ''First-Year Preceptorial'' (FYP) and the ''Sophomore Research Seminar'' (SRS).\n\nThe mission of FYP is, \"through reading, writing, and discussing important ideas from diverse perspectives, [to help] students develop an appreciation for the values embodied in the liberal arts. These include the habits and skills of critical inquiry, a tolerance for diverse points of view, an awareness of ambiguity, and a deep curiosity about the social, ethical, cultural, political, and natural world in which we live. All of this takes place in an environment that cultivates skills in analytical reading, clear and vigorous writing, and convincing argumentation.\"<ref>{{cite web |title= First-Year Preceptorial |url= http://www.union.edu/Resources/Academic/precept/index.php |accessdate=2009-08-28}}</ref> The typical FYP relies on a significant reading load of traditional as well as modern texts, together with substantial classroom discussion and written analysis of ideas and authors.\n\nThe SRS, as a complementary course, is intended to focus on the learning of research methods, evidence-based reasoning, and the techniques of sound written argumentation.<ref>{{cite web |title= Sophomore Research Seminar |url= http://www.union.edu/Resources/Academic/advising/gen_ed/srs.php |accessdate=2009-08-28}}</ref> The typical SRS concentrates on a particular conceptual or historical problem and culminates in a substantial research paper. Most SRS sections involve a professional librarian in cooperation with a teaching faculty member.\n\nMost undergraduates are required to complete a minimum of 36 term courses in all programs except engineering, which may require up to 40 courses (in two-degree programs, nine courses beyond the requirements for the professional degrees) and students in the Leadership in Medicine program, which requires around 45-50 courses.<ref>{{cite book | title = Union College Academic Register, 2008\u20132009 |publisher=Union College | page = 3}}</ref>\n\n===Admissions===\nFor the Class of 2022 (enrolling fall 2018), Union College received 6,716 applications and accepted 2,598 (38.7%), with 571 enrolling.<ref name=CDS>{{cite web|url=https://www.union.edu/institutional-research/common-data-set-cds# |title=Union College Common Data Set 2018-2019 |publisher=Union College}}</ref>  The middle 50% range of [[SAT]] scores of enrolled freshmen was 620-700 for reading and writing, and 650-730 for math, while the middle 50% range of the [[ACT (test)|ACT]] composite score was 28-32.<ref name=CDS/>  The average high school grade point average ([[GPA]]) was 3.40.<ref name=CDS/>\n\n===Undergraduate research===\nUndergraduate research at Union College had its origin in the first third of the 20th century, when chemistry professor Charles Hurd began involving students in his [[colloid chemistry]] investigations. Since then, undergraduate research has taken hold in all disciplines at the college, making this endeavor what has been termed \"the [[:wiktionary:linchpin|linchpin]]\" of the Union education. By the mid-1960s several disciplines at Union had established a senior research thesis requirement, and in 1978 the college began funding faculty-mentored student research in all disciplines. This was followed by the creation of funded summer research opportunities, again in all disciplines at the college, in 1986.\nExamples of possible programs include summer undergraduate research, in which students are supported each summer by the college on independent projects with a sponsoring faculty member; the [[National Conference on Undergraduate Research]], to which Union sends one of the largest contingents to its national conference each year where the students present their work and interact with peers from colleges and universities across the country; general internships at such nearby sites as [[GE Global Research|General Electric's Global Research Center]]; and the Steinmetz Symposium day. On a Friday in May, over 300 students, previously carrying out research within the past year, present their research and projects to their fellow students, teachers, staff, and visitors. Students also have the school day off, and presentations take form in slideshows, performances, lectures, and many other creative forms.<ref>{{cite web |title=Undergraduate Research |publisher=Union College |url=http://www.union.edu/Resources/Academic/undergrad_research/index.php |accessdate=2009-08-31}}</ref>\n\n===Study abroad programs===\nUnion College makes available a variety of opportunities for formal study outside the United States, the most popular of which are the Terms Abroad Programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.union.edu/offices/international/|title=International Programs              - Union College|publisher=|accessdate=7 December 2016}}</ref>  Currently, Terms Abroad are offered for residence and study on nearly every continent, some in cooperation with [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges]].

The library currently makes available onsite about 750,000 books in print as well as electronic formats. The two largest historical, electronic collections are ''Early English Books Online'' (EEBO) and ''Eighteenth Century Collections Online'' (ECCO). EEBO contains digital facsimile pages of nearly every work printed in English from 1473 to 1700, while ECCO continues the project up to 1800. The library's print and rare book collections are especially strong in [[18th century in literature|18th]] and [[19th century in literature|19th century literature]], the [[Scientific Revolution]], and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].

Three other surviving national fraternities \u2013 [[Psi Upsilon]] (1833), [[Chi Psi]] (1841), and [[Theta Delta Chi]] (1847) \u2013 were founded at Union in the next two decades; on account of this fecundity, Union would in the twentieth century call itself the '[[Mother of Fraternities]]'.<ref name=\"somers304\"/>  As with most historical generalizations, this one requires qualification. What does seem true is that Union's claim to priority is that the oldest secret Greek letter social fraternity with a continuing record was founded at the college. None of the early societies at Union or elsewhere can precisely challenge the claim of Union's Sigma Phi, which became the first national fraternity with the founding of a second chapter at Hamilton College in 1831,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sigmaphi.org/?page=History|title=History of the Sigma Phi - Sigma Phi Society|publisher=|accessdate=7 December 2016}}</ref> but the founders of the first fraternities at Union were obviously imitating or improving upon existing models. [[Miami University]] also refers to itself this way.<ref name=somers305>Somers (2003), p. 305</ref>\n\nThe eight current fraternities at Union are members of the [[North American Interfraternity Conference]], and as such come under the supervision of the Interfraternity Council (IFC).

These included [[Gideon Hawley]]<ref>{{cite book|title=Dictionary of American Biography (DAB)|publisher=Scribner|location=New York|page=8:418}}</ref> (1809), the first superintendent of public instruction in New York State; [[Francis Wayland]]<ref>''DAB'', 19:560</ref> (1813), president of [[Brown University]]; [[Henry Philip Tappan]]<ref>''DAB'', 18:302</ref> (1825), president of the [[University of Michigan]]; [[Matthew Meigs]]<ref>{{cite journal|title=Information on Matthew Kughler Meigs|journal=University of Delaware Archives|issue=Information Sheet 12}}</ref> (1836), President of Delaware College ([[University of Delaware]]) (1850-1851), founder and principal of [[The Hill School]] in 1851, and U.S. Consul to Piraeus, Greece (1868-1869); [[Sheldon Jackson]]<ref>''DAB'', 9:555</ref> (1855), who was the first superintendent of public instruction in Alaska and introduced the idea of domesticating reindeer as a food source for the native population; and [[Laurenus Clark Seelye]] (1857), the first president of [[Smith College]].\n\n[[File:William Seward, Secretary of State, bw photo portrait circa 1860-1865.jpg|thumb|150px|border|right|[[William H.

In addition, Union had two alumni serve simultaneously as Secretary of State: while William H. Seward served as U.S. Secretary of State, [[Robert Toombs]] (Class of 1828) served as [[Confederate States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] for the [[Confederate States of America]]. [[Jimmy Carter]], the 39th President of the United States, studied Nuclear Physics at the Graduate School.\n\nIn 1845 Union established a course in [[civil engineering]].  Many of the graduates in this course went on to work on significant construction projects.  In fact, it has been claimed that, for a time, the \"designers and builders of the country's canals and railroads were overwhelmingly graduates of the military academy at [[West Point]], [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], and Union College...\".<ref name=rudolph63/>  Among these early engineering graduates were [[James Chatham Duane]]<ref>''DAB'', 5:466</ref> (1844) and Jacob Hays Linville<ref>{{cite journal   | last = Katte   | first = Walter   | authorlink =    | title = Memoir of Jacob Hays Linville  | journal = Proceedings of the American Society of Civil Engineers   | volume = 33, pt. 2   | issue =   | pages = 744\u2013750   | publisher =   | location =   | year = 1907 }}</ref> (1848).

His stepfather, Bud ([[Robert Hays]]), had left some years earlier when he got back together with Edna but they didn't tell Hyde of their whereabouts. A half brother was mentioned once in a Season 8 episode, though not much is known about him.\n\nHyde's best friend, and later foster-brother, is the nice, geeky [[Eric Forman]]. The two share probably the closest friendship out of the group, shown by how they care and rely on one another and one another's advice. When Hyde's mother leaves town at the end of the first season, Eric tries to persuade his parents to do something about his best friend's living conditions and thus Hyde is invited to live with the Formans, which Hyde does from season one until the series' end. He is adopted into the Forman family, and lives in the basement of their house. Since there are no extra bedrooms, he sleeps in a small storage room on a cot. When [[Red Forman|Red]] kicks Hyde out after an arrest for drug possession, Eric attempts to come to his rescue.\n\nHyde found a job working at the Foto Hut with his burned-out hippie boss [[Leo (That '70s Show)|Leo]] ([[Tommy Chong]]). Hyde and Leo become good friends until Leo suddenly leaves town because he remembered that he was only supposed to stay in Point Place for a short time, yet stayed for eight years, leaving his family behind. During his tenure in the Foto Hut, he was the more responsible worker between himself and Leo, even telling his own boss off for not doing his job. Hyde and Leo's friendship resumes when Leo returns near the end of Season 7. He gives the money he makes to Red and [[Kitty Forman|Kitty]] to help them pay the bills. It is evident that Hyde has a sense of propriety and responsibility to rival that of his friend Eric's, yet is not proud of it as he is more accustomed to his stoner lifestyle.\n\nHyde develops a fairly close relationship with Eric's dad, Red Forman, who admires his toughness, lack of showing emotions and traditional masculinity, a quality his son Eric lacks. Red becomes the closest Hyde has to a real father after he moves in with the Formans. Red does occasionally feel that Hyde can be a bad influence on Eric, particularly due to his frequent [[marijuana]] use, and briefly kicks him out when Hyde is arrested. However, he is often shown to have a deeper respect for Hyde over his own son and occasionally prefers Hyde over him (such as when he offers Hyde a job at his new muffler shop instead of Eric).\n\nIn the season 6 finale, Kitty discovers that Bud is not Hyde's real father. Subsequently, Hyde meets his biological father, William Barnett ([[Tim Reid]]), who is an African American, making Hyde [[biracial]]. He later meets his half-sister, Angie Barnett who dreams of one day running her own store, but ends up working alongside Hyde in their father's store.\n\nHyde is highly critical of organized religion. He tells an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] girl that she believes in \"the exact opposite of what he believes in\". Also, in \"Holy Crap\", he claims he doesn't go to church because it would make him a hypocrite, him believing that organized religion has corrupted the teachings of the likes of others like [[Jesus]], [[Buddha]] and [[Muhammad]]. Despite the fact that Hyde mentions God (such as stating his hair was a gift from God in \"Eric's Hot Cousin\",) he does not express any sort of organized religious affiliation. However, he is shown on several occasions to be reverent and somewhat religious when times call for it.\n\nIn contrast to the sensitive [[Postmodernism|New-Age]] men prevalent in the 1970s, Hyde is very traditionally masculine, much like Red Forman. He does not voice or show his emotions often (a notable exception being when he has to tell Jackie he cheated on her in season 5, and other occurrences throughout their relationship). He does not worry about romantic relationships and women the way [[Michael Kelso]], Eric and Fez do; he considers himself too \"tough\" and strong for that type of behavior. He generally acts as though he does not care for anyone, perhaps as a defensive mechanism; however, it is shown during the course of the series that he does care deeply about his friends and the Formans. Hyde seems to be against extracurricular activities, although he does mention that he plays baseball in school and is a fan of the [[Green Bay Packers]]. Hyde's other hobbies include music, hunting, hanging around and he is also shown to have a talent in mechanics.\n\nAfter Eric's departure to [[Africa]], Hyde's conflicts were front and center in the series, mostly due to his relationship with Eric's parents (his foster parents) and his short marriage to Samantha. He experiences conflict with Kelso, who he punches for attempting to sleep with Jackie in Chicago. He also struggles to maintain civility with Jackie and manage his career. Later in the final season, Hyde receives a letter from his father, William Barnett telling him that he is selling his chain of record stores. Hyde, angry at the vague letter, fears that he won't be able to continue the career he loves. This drives him to actually quit \"the circle\" (although he returns to it by episode's end) Later, Barnett shows up to Hyde's record store to tell him that he sold every store except for the one in Point Place and has granted him sole ownership of the last remaining Grooves. Hyde ends the series as the owner and manager of his Grooves record store.\n\n==Relationships==\n\nEarly on in the series, he is rarely interested in getting into a serious relationship, and is very cynical about the idea (as portrayed in some of his quips such as \"Dating is prostitution, only you don't always get what you pay for\"). However, as the series progresses, he enjoys a number of relationships. It was mentioned that his only girlfriend ended up leaving him for his uncle, and when Hyde and Fez make fun of Kelso for being \"whipped\" by Jackie, Kelso points out that he is the only one \"getting some\", which Hyde accepts with slight amusement.\n\nHyde's first love interest of the series was a proto-punk girl named Crissy, who wanted him to move to New York City with her, but he ultimately decides to stay in Point Place, and she leaves for New York. The relationship lasted only one episode.\n\nBefore Eric and [[Donna Pinciotti|Donna]] ([[Laura Prepon]]) started to date, Eric and Hyde both had feelings for Donna. Hyde tries to win Donna to the point that even Fez began to mock him over his repeated failed attempts. At one point he attempts to kiss her, but she rejects him with a slap. In an early episode, she blows off a \"study date\" with Hyde at the library to go out with Eric for [[Valentine's Day]]. Hyde goes to talk to Donna while she is out with Eric and tells her how he feels about her. However, Donna doesn't understand him because she is drunk. Hyde gives up soon after, prompting the assumption that he was more infatuated with Donna and not in love with her and they remain close friends.\n\nIn Season 5, he begins dating [[Jackie Burkhart]]. There is foreshadowing of their relationship throughout the series, most prominently at the Forman's Veteran's Day BBQ in Season 3, where Jackie's date Chip calls her a bitch behind her back. Hyde responds by knocking Chip out cold. Later that day, after talking to Mrs. Forman, Hyde takes Jackie out for their first date which leads to their first kiss. Hyde also took Jackie to his junior prom in the first season, and he is the one Jackie goes to for comfort when she and Kelso encounter problems in their relationship, prompting him to ask, \"Why does she always come to me?\" Despite initially loathing Jackie for all that she represents (she is spoiled, shallow, and rich), he has his first real romantic relationship of the series with her.\n\nHyde and Jackie's relationship is a very typical 'opposites attract' relationship. Hyde tells Eric that he simply ignores Jackie's constant complaining and bossiness and focuses on how \"hot\" she is instead, although he does become more mature and caring as their relationship progresses. They come together during the summer between Seasons 4 and 5 when they find themselves bored with watching ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. The relationship gradually grows into a surprisingly strong one, considering their past conflicts. However, Jackie sees Kelso making out with Annette (the girl Kelso dated while he was in California ) and yelled \"get off my boyfriend\". Hyde breaks up with Jackie but it only lasts an episode before they get back together and go to the Valentine's Day dance. They also go through trouble when Hyde mistakenly believes she is cheating on him with Kelso. In response, he cheats on her. He sincerely apologizes, but Jackie ends the relationship. The separation is brief, however, and they get back together at the beginning of Season 6. They remain together until midway through Season 7, when Jackie becomes insecure about their relationship and asks Hyde if he can see a future with her. His response, \"I don't know\", breaks them up briefly, but they reconcile after only a few weeks apart. However, when Jackie is offered a job in Chicago, Hyde is once again forced to make a decision about a possible future together. Just when Jackie thinks Hyde will break up with her for good, Hyde makes the decision to marry her. At that moment, he finds a note from Jackie that says she's left for Chicago, and Hyde is hurt and angry. In the following next episode, however, he decides to follow her and propose. In the middle of Hyde and Jackie's conversation, Kelso walks into the room in only a towel, carrying a bucket of ice and making a comment implying he and Jackie were about to have sex. Although Kelso frequently makes sexual comments to every female on the show, including Jackie and Donna, Hyde once again believes the two really were about to engage in sex, and drives off to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].\n\nIn the last season, Hyde returns from Las Vegas after his confrontation with Jackie and Kelso. While he is in Vegas, he gets drunk and marries a stripper named Samantha. Although Jackie claims nothing happened between herself and Kelso in Chicago, Hyde chooses to stay in the marriage instead of annulling it, ending his and Jackie's relationship. The marriage is bitter, as they are often seen screaming at each other, but it is hinted that they have an excellent sex life and all the yelling was just a factor of it. In the middle of Season 8, Samantha's real husband showed up unexpectedly and decided to take Samantha with him back to Vegas. Donna points out that since Samantha was already married when she married Hyde, Hyde and Samantha were never legally married, making their marriage null and void. In the midst of the confusion, the two decided that it would be best for them to part ways, and Sam went back to Vegas. He had no significant other in the final episode.\n\n==Personality==\n\nHyde is a rebellious, distant, wise-cracking boy with no respect for authority and often makes it his main priority to defy as many policies or rules as possible, and seems to take pride in his own disobedience. He is tough, highly intelligent, supremely insensitive and seldom feels compassion for others, and often will make a sarcastic remark rather than show sympathy for somebody who is suffering. In fact, Hyde is easily the most intelligent member of the gang despite his bad upbringing and poor grades in school. It is revealed in the Halloween special that Hyde's reputation is first sabotaged in elementary school, when Eric Forman ruins another student's diorama and Hyde receives the blame, and has since then maintained a reputation as a troublemaker and rebel. Although he rebels against school and other educational activities, he is generally smart, as in the episode \"The Crunge\", Hyde scores second lowest among the gang, but does better than Eric without textbooks and without applying himself. When other members of the gang need advice, Hyde is usually the only one who gives them real advice. Also, Hyde is physically the strongest (and presumably the best fighter) in the group, although on multiple occasions Hyde has backed down from an aggressive Eric and rarely ever lashes out on Eric the same way he does with Fez and Kelso. On many occasions throughout the show, Hyde beats up Kelso for various reasons, and he is easily stronger than Fez, Eric and even Donna.\n\n==Appearance==\nHyde has an afro and sideburns (or occasionally a [[mustache]] and/or [[beard]]), and his [[sunglasses]], which he is almost always seen in, making him appear like [[Jeff Lynne]] of [[Electric Light Orchestra]] and [[Eric Bloom]] of [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/list/JonFox/steven_hydes_rock_n_roll_t_shirts/ |title=Steven Hyde's Rock 'n' Roll T-Shirts |publisher=Rate Your Music |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> He regularly sports jeans, was once failed in PE for refusing to wear shorts, and also has many [[Rock music|rock]] band T-shirts, which include: [[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[AC/DC]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[The Who]], [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Jimmy Page]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Thin Lizzy]], [[ZZ Top]], [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Steve Miller Band]], [[The Beatles]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[The Doors]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Ted Nugent]], [[Boston (band)|Boston]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Aerosmith]], [[John Lee Hooker]], [[The Allman Brothers Band]], [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]], [[Sex Pistols]], [[Ramones]] and the [[Grateful Dead]]. In at least one episode, he dons a two-tone green T-shirt displaying the International Paper corporate logo. Contrasting with his tough guy exterior, Hyde was once caught on videotape dancing to Frank Sinatra singing. Additionally, following his first breakup with Jackie, he happened to hear [[B. J. Thomas]]' \"[[(Hey Won't You Play) Another Somebody Done Somebody Wrong Song]]\" and becomes a fan of [[country music]] although the season 2 episode, \"Red's Last Day\", a drunken Hyde is seen singing \"Redneck Mother\" by Jerry Jeff Walker. Hyde, along with these many bands holds a passionate love of Led Zeppelin, the group he wears most frequently, and when once questioned by his father as to why he wears said shirts he replies, \"If God didn't want me to wear them so much he wouldn't have made them rock so hard.\" He also notes that he likes to watch ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'', because it \"reminds him of a simpler time\". He dislikes the music of [[Pat Boone]], [[Styx (band)|Styx]] (although he did tap his foot to their music), [[ABBA]], [[Andy Gibb]], [[The Carpenters]], and [[Little River Band]]. In fact, he once even broke up with a girl because she liked the [[Little River Band]].\n\nSteven is known to drive a black 1967 [[Chevrolet El Camino]] that is referenced in several episodes. It was given to him by Leo in the episode [[Radio Daze]].\n\nHe hates disco (even starting a disco burning bonfire in season 8); however, the real reason he hates disco was because of his lack of dance skills. However, Kitty teaches him to dance (which led Bob to believing Kitty was having an affair with him) and later danced with Donna to it in the first seasons.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{That '70s Show}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hyde, Steven}}\n[[Category:Fictional adoptees]]\n[[Category:Fictional cannabis users]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1998]]\n[[Category:Fictional shopkeepers]]\n[[Category:That '70s Show characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n[[Category:Teenage characters in television]]\n[[Category:Fictional African-American people]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the fictional character|the Australian scientist|Stephen Hyde|the American cyclist|Stephen Hyde (cyclist)}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{Notability|fiction|date=April 2012}}\n{{more citations needed|date=April 2012}}\n{{in-universe|date=April 2012}}\n}}\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Steven Hyde\n| series             = [[That '70s Show]]\n| image              = Hyde.png\n| first              = \"[[That '70s Pilot]]\"<br />(episode 1.01)\n| last               = \"[[That '70s Finale]]\"<br />(episode 8.22)\n| portrayer          = [[Danny Masterson]]<br />[[Joey Zimmerman]] (age 13)<br />Easton Gage (age 7)\n| occupation         = Foto Hut clerk (formerly)<br />Hotel cook (formerly)<br />Muffler store associate (formerly) <br />Record store manager/owner (currently) \n| spouse             = Samantha Hyde (invalid marriage)\n| gender             = Male\n| family             = William Barnett (biological father)<br />Edna Hyde (mother)<br />Bud Hyde (legal father/step-father)<br />Angie Barnett (paternal half-sister)<br />[[Red Forman]] (foster father)<br />[[Kitty Forman]] (foster mother)<br />[[Eric Forman]] (foster brother)<br />[[Laurie Forman]] (foster sister)\n| significant_other = [[Jackie Burkhart]] (ex-girlfriend)<br />Jill (fling)<br />Kat Peterson (fling)<br />Chrissy (fling)<br />Pam Macy (fling)<br />[[Donna Pinciotti]] (former crush; kissed)<br />Unnamed Nurse (one night stand)\n| nationality        = [[United States|American]]\n}}\n\n'''Steven James Hyde''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] sitcom ''[[That '70s Show]]'', portrayed by [[Danny Masterson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0015049/|title=Steven Hyde (Character)|publisher=}}</ref> He is [[Eric Forman]]'s ([[Topher Grace]]) best friend and by the end of season one, his [[de facto]] adopted brother.\n\n==Storylines==\nHyde is [[child abandonment|abandoned]] by his mother, Edna ([[Katey Sagal]]), who only appears in three episodes, two of which feature only her screaming voice calling from inside Hyde's house. His stepfather, Bud ([[Robert Hays]]), had left some years earlier when he got back together with Edna but they didn't tell Hyde of their whereabouts. A half brother was mentioned once in a Season 8 episode, though not much is known about him.\n\nHyde's best friend, and later foster-brother, is the nice, geeky [[Eric Forman]]. The two share probably the closest friendship out of the group, shown by how they care and rely on one another and one another's advice. When Hyde's mother leaves town at the end of the first season, Eric tries to persuade his parents to do something about his best friend's living conditions and thus Hyde is invited to live with the Formans, which Hyde does from season one until the series' end. He is adopted into the Forman family, and lives in the basement of their house. Since there are no extra bedrooms, he sleeps in a small storage room on a cot. When [[Red Forman|Red]] kicks Hyde out after an arrest for drug possession, Eric attempts to come to his rescue.\n\nHyde found a job working at the Foto Hut with his burned-out hippie boss [[Leo (That '70s Show)|Leo]] ([[Tommy Chong]]). Hyde and Leo become good friends until Leo suddenly leaves town because he remembered that he was only supposed to stay in Point Place for a short time, yet stayed for eight years, leaving his family behind. During his tenure in the Foto Hut, he was the more responsible worker between himself and Leo, even telling his own boss off for not doing his job. Hyde and Leo's friendship resumes when Leo returns near the end of Season 7. He gives the money he makes to Red and [[Kitty Forman|Kitty]] to help them pay the bills. It is evident that Hyde has a sense of propriety and responsibility to rival that of his friend Eric's, yet is not proud of it as he is more accustomed to his stoner lifestyle.\n\nHyde develops a fairly close relationship with Eric's dad, Red Forman, who admires his toughness, lack of showing emotions and traditional masculinity, a quality his son Eric lacks. Red becomes the closest Hyde has to a real father after he moves in with the Formans. Red does occasionally feel that Hyde can be a bad influence on Eric, particularly due to his frequent [[marijuana]] use, and briefly kicks him out when Hyde is arrested. However, he is often shown to have a deeper respect for Hyde over his own son and occasionally prefers Hyde over him (such as when he offers Hyde a job at his new muffler shop instead of Eric).\n\nIn the season 6 finale, Kitty discovers that Bud is not Hyde's real father. Subsequently, Hyde meets his biological father, William Barnett ([[Tim Reid]]), who is a African American, making Hyde [[biracial]]. He later meets his half-sister, Angie Barnett who dreams of one day running her own store, but ends up working alongside Hyde in their father's store.\n\nHyde is highly critical of organized religion. He tells an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] girl that she believes in \"the exact opposite of what he believes in\". Also, in \"Holy Crap\", he claims he doesn't go to church because it would make him a hypocrite, him believing that organized religion has corrupted the teachings of the likes of others like [[Jesus]], [[Buddha]] and [[Muhammad]]. Despite the fact that Hyde mentions God (such as stating his hair was a gift from God in \"Eric's Hot Cousin\",) he does not express any sort of organized religious affiliation. However, he is shown on several occasions to be reverent and somewhat religious when times call for it.\n\nIn contrast to the sensitive [[Postmodernism|New-Age]] men prevalent in the 1970s, Hyde is very traditionally masculine, much like Red Forman. He does not voice or show his emotions often (a notable exception being when he has to tell Jackie he cheated on her in season 5, and other occurrences throughout their relationship). He does not worry about romantic relationships and women the way [[Michael Kelso]], Eric and Fez do; he considers himself too \"tough\" and strong for that type of behavior. He generally acts as though he does not care for anyone, perhaps as a defensive mechanism; however, it is shown during the course of the series that he does care deeply about his friends and the Formans. Hyde seems to be against extracurricular activities, although he does mention that he plays baseball in school and is a fan of the [[Green Bay Packers]]. Hyde's other hobbies include music, hunting, hanging around and he is also shown to have a talent in mechanics.\n\nAfter Eric's departure to [[Africa]], Hyde's conflicts were front and center in the series, mostly due to his relationship with Eric's parents (his foster parents) and his short marriage to Samantha. He experiences conflict with Kelso, who he punches for attempting to sleep with Jackie in Chicago. He also struggles to maintain civility with Jackie and manage his career. Later in the final season, Hyde receives a letter from his father, William Barnett telling him that he is selling his chain of record stores. Hyde, angry at the vague letter, fears that he won't be able to continue the career he loves. This drives him to actually quit \"the circle\" (although he returns to it by episode's end) Later, Barnett shows up to Hyde's record store to tell him that he sold every store except for the one in Point Place and has granted him sole ownership of the last remaining Grooves. Hyde ends the series as the owner and manager of his Grooves record store.\n\n==Relationships==\n\nEarly on in the series, he is rarely interested in getting into a serious relationship, and is very cynical about the idea (as portrayed in some of his quips such as \"Dating is prostitution, only you don't always get what you pay for\"). However, as the series progresses, he enjoys a number of relationships. It was mentioned that his only girlfriend ended up leaving him for his uncle, and when Hyde and Fez make fun of Kelso for being \"whipped\" by Jackie, Kelso points out that he is the only one \"getting some\", which Hyde accepts with slight amusement.\n\nHyde's first love interest of the series was a proto-punk girl named Crissy, who wanted him to move to New York City with her, but he ultimately decides to stay in Point Place, and she leaves for New York. The relationship lasted only one episode.\n\nBefore Eric and [[Donna Pinciotti|Donna]] ([[Laura Prepon]]) started to date, Eric and Hyde both had feelings for Donna. Hyde tries to win Donna to the point that even Fez began to mock him over his repeated failed attempts. At one point he attempts to kiss her, but she rejects him with a slap. In an early episode, she blows off a \"study date\" with Hyde at the library to go out with Eric for [[Valentine's Day]]. Hyde goes to talk to Donna while she is out with Eric and tells her how he feels about her. However, Donna doesn't understand him because she is drunk. Hyde gives up soon after, prompting the assumption that he was more infatuated with Donna and not in love with her and they remain close friends.\n\nIn Season 5, he begins dating [[Jackie Burkhart]]. There is foreshadowing of their relationship throughout the series, most prominently at the Forman's Veteran's Day BBQ in Season 3, where Jackie's date Chip calls her a bitch behind her back. Hyde responds by knocking Chip out cold. Later that day, after talking to Mrs. Forman, Hyde takes Jackie out for their first date which leads to their first kiss. Hyde also took Jackie to his junior prom in the first season, and he is the one Jackie goes to for comfort when she and Kelso encounter problems in their relationship, prompting him to ask, \"Why does she always come to me?\" Despite initially loathing Jackie for all that she represents (she is spoiled, shallow, and rich), he has his first real romantic relationship of the series with her.\n\nHyde and Jackie's relationship is a very typical 'opposites attract' relationship. Hyde tells Eric that he simply ignores Jackie's constant complaining and bossiness and focuses on how \"hot\" she is instead, although he does become more mature and caring as their relationship progresses. They come together during the summer between Seasons 4 and 5 when they find themselves bored with watching ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''.

The [[Dawar (Pashtun tribe)|Dawar]] Maliks and mullahs left the Tochi for the Khaisor Valley to the south to rouse the Torikhel [[Wazir (Pashtun tribe)|Wazirs]]. A month after the incident, Faqir Ipi called a tribal [[jirga]] in the village of Ipi near Mir Ali to declare war against the British imperialists.\n\n== Freedom movement against the British Raj ==\nFaqir's decision to declare war against the British was endorsed by the local Pashtun tribes, who mustered two large lashkars 10,000 strong to battle the British. Interestingly, many Pashtun women also took part in the freedom movement, who not only actively participated in the war but also sung ''landai'' (a short folk-song sung by Pashtun women) to inspire the Pashtun fighters. Widespread lawlessness erupted as the Pashtuns blocked roads, overran outposts and ambushed convoys. In November 1936, the British sent two columns to the Khaisor river valley to crush the freedom movement, but suffered heavy casualties.<ref name=\"at\">{{Cite web|url=https://asiatimes.com/2020/04/__trashed-50/|title=Remembering the Faqir of Ipi|website=Asia Times|date=April 16, 2020|access-date=April 17, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSoon after the Khaisor campaign a general uprising broke out throughout [[Waziristan campaign (1936\u20131939)|Waziristan campaign]], realising the futility of confronting the British Army directly especially with their advantage of air power, tribesmen switched to guerrilla warfare. Squadrons of the two air forces ([[RAF]] and RIAF) tried many tactics including scorched earth retaliation involving the burning of standing crops with jerry can petrol bombs and the killing of cattle with strafing attacks.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nIn 1937, the British sent over 40,000 British-Indian troops, mostly [[Sikhs]] from the [[Punjab]], to crush the freedom movement in Waziristan. This was in response to an ambush by Waziristani tribesmen in which they had killed over 50 British soldiers. However, the British operation failed and by December\u060c the troops were sent back to cantonments. In 1939, the British claimed that the war capacity of Faqir Ipi's forces was enhanced by support from [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Italy]], alleging that the Italian diplomat Pietro Quaroni drove the Italian policy for involvement in Waziristan, although the British could not find any valid evidence for Pietro Quaroni's involvement.<ref name=\"at\"/>\n\nThe British suppressed the agitation by imposing fines and by destroying the houses of their leaders, including that of Faqir Ipi. However, the pyrrhic nature of the victory and the subsequent withdrawal of the troops was credited by the Wazirs to be a manifestation of Faqir Ipi's miraculous powers. He succeeded in inducing a semblance of tribal unity, as the British noticed with dismay, among various sections of Wazirs, Dawar, [[Mahsud]]s and [[Bettani]]s. He cemented his position as religious leader by declaring a Jihad against the British. This move also helped rally support from Pashtun tribesman across the border. In 1946, the British again attempted to crush Faqir Ipi's movement but failed.\n\n==Jirga in Bannu==\nOn 21 June 1947, Faqir Ipi, [[Abdul Ghaffar Khan]], and other [[Khudai Khidmatgar]]s held a jirga in Bannu during which they declared the [[Bannu Resolution]], demanding that the Pashtuns be given a choice to have an independent state of [[Pashtunistan]] composing all Pashtun majority territories of British India, instead of being made to join the new dominions of India or Pakistan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nation.com.pk/25-Aug-2019/past-in-perspective|title=Past in Perspective|website=The Nation|date=August 25, 2019|access-date=August 25, 2019}}</ref> However, the British Raj refused to comply with the demand of the Bannu Resolution and only the options for Pakistan and India were given.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ali Shah |first=Sayyid Vaqar |date=1993 |title=Afghanistan and the Frontier |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c05uAAAAMAAJ |location=[[University of Michigan]] |publisher=Emjay Books International |page=256 |isbn= |editor1-first=Fazal-ur-Rahim Khan |editor1-last=Marwat}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=H Johnson |first1=Thomas |author-link1=Thomas Howard Johnson |last2=Zellen |first2=Barry |date=2014 |title=Culture, Conflict, and Counterinsurgency |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B9ZZAgAAQBAJ |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |page=154 |isbn= 9780804789219}}</ref> In response, Faqir Ipi and the Khudai Khidmatgars boycotted the [[1947 North-West Frontier Province referendum]] on joining India or Pakistan, citing that it did not have the options for the province to become independent or join Afghanistan.\n\n== Pashtunistan movement ==\nFaqir Ipi rejected the creation of Pakistan after the [[partition of India]], considering Pakistan to be a continuation of British imperialism. In 1948, Faqir Ipi took control of North Waziristan's [[Datta Khel Subdivision|Datta Khel]] area and declared the establishment of an independent [[Pashtunistan]], forming ties with regional leaders including [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and Prince [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]]. On 29 May 1949, Faqir Ipi called a tribal jirga in his headquarters of Gurwek and asked Pakistan to accept Pashtunistan as an independent state. He published a Pashto-language newspaper, ''Gh\u0101z\u012b'', from Gurwek to promote his ideas. In January 1950, a Pashtun [[loya jirga]] in [[Razmak]] symbolically appointed Faqir Ipi as the first president of the \"National Assembly for Pashtunistan\". In 1953-54, the [[Pakistan Air Force]] led an operation from Miramshah airbase and heavily bombarded Faqir Ipi's compound in Gurwek.<ref name=\"at\"/> Although he himself never surrendered to Pakistan until his death in 1960 but his movement diminished after 1954 when his [[Commander-in-chief]] Mehar Dil Khan Mehsud surrendered to the [[Pakistani authorities]] and became loyal to the state of Pakistan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nation.com.pk/25-Aug-2019/past-in-perspective|title=Past in Perspective|date=2019-08-24|website=The Nation|language=en|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>\n\n== Death ==\nFaqir Ipi died at night on April 16, 1960.

He became a religious figure among the locals and was called \"Haji Sahab\".\n\n== Restoration of King Amanullah Khan ==\nIn 1933, Faqir Ipi went to [[Afghanistan]] to fight against the [[Mohammadzai]] Afghan King at [[Khost]] to support the restoration of King [[Amanullah Khan]]. In 1944, Faqir Ipi joined his fellow [[Loya Paktia]] tribesmen again to support the restoration of Amanullah Khan in the [[Afghan tribal revolts of 1944\u20131947]].<ref name=\"GeorgeHill2013\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=TzRlAgAAQBAJ|title=Proceed to Peshawar: The Story of a U.S. Navy Intelligence Mission on the Afghan Border, 1943|last=Hill|first=George|date=2013-11-15|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=|isbn=9781612513287|location=|pages=|quote=Engert letter to State Department, 15 July 1944, says that the rebel leader Abdurrahman, was next in importance to the faqir of Ipi.|language=en|chapter=Chapter 3, the trip (Bibliography near end of the book)}}</ref> Until his death, Faqir Ipi remained involved in Afghan politics as he did not recognize Pakistan.<ref name=\"115th anniversary\">[https://tribune.com.pk/story/1086737/april-1891-1960-the-legendary-guerilla-faqir-of-ipi-unremembered-on-his-115th-anniversary/ The legendary guerilla Faqir of Ipi unremembered on his 115th anniversary].

The ruling was based on the fact that the girl was a minor and was asked to make her decision of conversion and marriage after she reaches the age of majority, till then she was asked to live with a third party.<ref name=\"Yousef Aboul-Enein\">{{cite book|title=The Secret War for the Middle East|year=2013|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=978-1612513096|page=153|author=Yousef Aboul-Enein|author2=Basil Aboul-Enein}}</ref> The verdict enraged the Pashtuns, and further mobilized Faqir Ipi for a guerrilla war against the British Empire. The [[Dawar (Pashtun tribe)|Dawar]] Maliks and mullahs left the Tochi for the Khaisor Valley to the south to rouse the Torikhel [[Wazir (Pashtun tribe)|Wazirs]]. A month after the incident, Faqir Ipi called a tribal [[jirga]] in the village of Ipi near Mir Ali to declare war against the British imperialists.\n\n== Freedom movement against the British Raj ==\nFaqir's decision to declare war against the British was endorsed by the local Pashtun tribes, who mustered two large lashkars 10,000 strong to battle the British. Interestingly, many Pashtun women also took part in the freedom movement, who not only actively participated in the war but also sung ''landai'' (a short folk-song sung by Pashtun women) to inspire the Pashtun fighters. Widespread lawlessness erupted as the Pashtuns blocked roads, overran outposts and ambushed convoys. In November 1936, the British sent two columns to the Khaisor river valley to crush the freedom movement, but suffered heavy casualties.<ref name=\"at\">{{Cite web|url=https://asiatimes.com/2020/04/__trashed-50/|title=Remembering the Faqir of Ipi|website=Asia Times|date=April 16, 2020|access-date=April 17, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSoon after the Khaisor campaign a general uprising broke out throughout [[Waziristan campaign (1936\u20131939)|Waziristan campaign]], realising the futility of confronting the British Army directly especially with their advantage of air power, tribesmen switched to guerrilla warfare. Squadrons of the two air forces ([[RAF]] and RIAF) tried many tactics including scorched earth retaliation involving the burning of standing crops with jerry can petrol bombs and the killing of cattle with strafing attacks.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nIn 1937, the British sent over 40,000 British-Indian troops, mostly [[Sikhs]] from the [[Punjab]], to crush the freedom movement in Waziristan. This was in response to an ambush by Waziristani tribesmen in which they had killed over 50 British soldiers. However, the British operation failed and by December\u060c the troops were sent back to cantonments. In 1939, the British claimed that the war capacity of Faqir Ipi's forces was enhanced by support from [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Italy]], alleging that the Italian diplomat Pietro Quaroni drove the Italian policy for involvement in Waziristan, although the British could not find any valid evidence for Pietro Quaroni's involvement.<ref name=\"at\"/>\n\nThe British suppressed the agitation by imposing fines and by destroying the houses of their leaders, including that of Faqir Ipi. However, the pyrrhic nature of the victory and the subsequent withdrawal of the troops was credited by the Wazirs to be a manifestation of Faqir Ipi's miraculous powers. He succeeded in inducing a semblance of tribal unity, as the British noticed with dismay, among various sections of Wazirs, Dawar, [[Mahsud]]s and [[Bettani]]s. He cemented his position as religious leader by declaring a Jihad against the British. This move also helped rally support from Pashtun tribesman across the border. In 1946, the British again attempted to crush Faqir Ipi's movement but failed.\n\n==Jirga in Bannu==\nOn 21 June 1947, Faqir Ipi, [[Abdul Ghaffar Khan]], and other [[Khudai Khidmatgar]]s held a jirga in Bannu during which they declared the [[Bannu Resolution]], demanding that the Pashtuns be given a choice to have an independent state of [[Pashtunistan]] composing all Pashtun majority territories of British India, instead of being made to join the new dominions of India or Pakistan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nation.com.pk/25-Aug-2019/past-in-perspective|title=Past in Perspective|website=The Nation|date=August 25, 2019|access-date=August 25, 2019}}</ref> However, the British Raj refused to comply with the demand of the Bannu Resolution and only the options for Pakistan and India were given.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ali Shah |first=Sayyid Vaqar |date=1993 |title=Afghanistan and the Frontier |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c05uAAAAMAAJ |location=[[University of Michigan]] |publisher=Emjay Books International |page=256 |isbn= |editor1-first=Fazal-ur-Rahim Khan |editor1-last=Marwat}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=H Johnson |first1=Thomas |author-link1=Thomas Howard Johnson |last2=Zellen |first2=Barry |date=2014 |title=Culture, Conflict, and Counterinsurgency |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B9ZZAgAAQBAJ |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |page=154 |isbn= 9780804789219}}</ref> In response, Faqir Ipi and the Khudai Khidmatgars boycotted the [[1947 North-West Frontier Province referendum]] on joining India or Pakistan, citing that it did not have the options for the province to become independent or join Afghanistan.\n\n== Pashtunistan movement ==\nFaqir Ipi rejected the creation of Pakistan after the [[partition of India]], considering Pakistan to be a continuation of British imperialism. In 1948, Faqir Ipi took control of North Waziristan's [[Datta Khel Subdivision|Datta Khel]] area and declared the establishment of an independent [[Pashtunistan]], forming ties with regional leaders including [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and Prince [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]]. On 29 May 1949, Faqir Ipi called a tribal jirga in his headquarters of Gurwek and asked Pakistan to accept Pashtunistan as an independent state. He published a Pashto-language newspaper, ''Gh\u0101z\u012b'', from Gurwek to promote his ideas. In January 1950, a Pashtun [[loya jirga]] in [[Razmak]] symbolically appointed Faqir Ipi as the first president of the \"National Assembly for Pashtunistan\". In 1953-54, the [[Pakistan Air Force]] led an operation from Miramshah airbase and heavily bombarded Faqir Ipi's compound in Gurwek.<ref name=\"at\"/> Although he himself never surrendered to Pakistan until his death in 1960 but his movement diminished after 1954 when his [[Commander-in-chief]] Mehar Dil Khan Mehsud surrendered to the [[Pakistani authorities]] and became loyal to the state of Pakistan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nation.com.pk/25-Aug-2019/past-in-perspective|title=Past in Perspective|date=2019-08-24|website=The Nation|language=en|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>\n\n== Death ==\nFaqir Ipi died at night on April 16, 1960. A long term sufferer of asthma during his last days, he became so sick that it was not possible for him to walk for a few steps. People from far away often used to come and see him and ask for his blessing.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} His funeral prayers or Namaz-I-Janaza was held at [[Gurwek]] led by Maulavi Pir Rehman.
