A [[Cape Verde hurricane]] that reached Category&nbsp;5 hurricane status on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]], David was the fourth named [[tropical cyclone]], second hurricane, and first major hurricane of the [[1979 Atlantic hurricane season]], traversing through the [[Leeward Islands]], [[Greater Antilles]], and [[East Coast of the United States]] during late August and early September. David was the first hurricane to affect the [[Lesser Antilles]] since [[Hurricane Inez]] in [[1966 Atlantic hurricane season|1966]]. With winds of 175&nbsp;mph (280&nbsp;km/h), David was the only storm of Category&nbsp;5 intensity to make landfall on the [[Dominican Republic]] in the 20th century and the deadliest since the [[1930 Dominican Republic Hurricane]], San Zenon, killing over 2,000&nbsp;people in its path.

It weakened to a tropical storm over land, but quickly re-strengthened as it again reached open waters. David turned to the northwest along the western periphery of the subtropical ridge, and re-intensified to a Category&nbsp;2 hurricane while over the [[Bahamas]], where it caused heavy damage. Despite initial forecasts of a projected landfall in [[Miami, Florida]], the hurricane turned to the north-northwest just before landfall to strike near [[West Palm Beach, Florida]] on September 3. It paralleled the Florida coastline just inland until emerging into the western Atlantic Ocean at [[New Smyrna Beach, Florida]] later on September 3. David continued to the north-northwest, and made its final landfall just south of [[Savannah, Georgia]] as a minimal hurricane on September 5. It turned to the northeast while weakening over land, and became extratropical on the 6th over New York.

This can be partly attributed to the fact that local radio warnings were minimal and disaster preparedness schemes were essentially non-existent. Furthermore, Dominica had not experienced a major hurricane since 1930, thus leading to complacency amongst much of the population.

Just to the south of Dominica, David brought [[Martinique]] winds of up to 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h) and 140&nbsp;mph (220&nbsp;km/h) sustained gust in the northeast of the coast of the Caravelle. The capital, [[Fort-de-France]], reported wave heights of 15&nbsp;feet (4.5&nbsp;m) and experienced strong tropical storm sustained winds at 56&nbsp;mph (90&nbsp;km/h) and gust at 78&nbsp;mph (126&nbsp;km/h). David's strong winds caused severe crop damage, mostly to bananas, amounting to $50&nbsp;million ($150&nbsp;million in 2007&nbsp;USD) in losses. Though no deaths were reported, the hurricane caused 20 to 30 injuries and left 500 homeless.<ref name=\"tcr3\"/>\n\n[[Guadeloupe]] experienced moderate to extensive damage on [[Basse-Terre Island]]. There, the banana crop was completely destroyed, and combined with other losses, crop damage amounted to $100&nbsp;million ($280&nbsp;million in 2005&nbsp;USD). David caused no deaths, a few injuries, and left several hundred homeless.

Portions of southwestern Puerto Rico experienced sustained winds of up to 85&nbsp;mph (135&nbsp;km/h), while the rest of the island received tropical storm-force winds. While passing by the island, the hurricane caused strong seas<ref name=\"puerto\">[http://huracanado1.tripod.com/history2.html Puerto Rico Hurricane History]</ref> and torrential rainfall, amounting to 19.9&nbsp;inches (505&nbsp;mm) in [[Mayag\u00fcez, Puerto Rico]] and up to 20&nbsp;inches (510&nbsp;mm) in the central mountainous region.<ref name=\"mwr\"/>\n\nDespite remaining offshore, most of the island felt David's effects.

The storm caused torrential rainfall, resulting in extreme river flooding.<ref name=\"mwr\"/> The flooding swept away entire villages and isolated communities during the storm's onslaught. A rail-mounted container crane collapsed in [[Rio Haina]] at the sea-land terminal.

A citizen named Fred White ended that by using a battery-operated ham radio to contact the world.<ref name=\"dom1\"/>\n\nIn response to the severe agricultural damage, the government initiated a food ration. By two months after the storm, assistance pledges amounted to over $37&nbsp;million (1979 US$) from various groups around the world. Similar to the aftermath of other natural disasters, the distribution of the aid raised concerns and accusations over the amount of food and material, or lack thereof, for the affected citizens.<ref name=\"dom1\"/> The Hurricane destroyed some important landmarks, including a significant part of the ruins of the [[Fort Young Hotel|Fort Young]] which had stood since the 1770s.<ref name=\"Gravette2000\">{{cite book|last=Gravette|first=Andrew Gerald|title=Architectural heritage of the Caribbean: an A-Z of historic buildings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=US59JbQ6-OYC&pg=PA168|accessdate=June 22, 2011|year=2000|publisher=Signal Books|isbn=978-1-902669-09-0|page=168}}</ref>\n\nAnother occurrence less typical of the aftermath of other natural disasters was the looting.

Sailing through mountainous seas, ''Fife'' docked in the main harbor at Roseau without assistance, and was the only outside help for several days. The crew provided work details and medical parties to offer assistance to the island and concentrated on the hospital buildings, the airstrip, and restoring power and water. The ship's helicopter (called ''Humphrey'') took medical aid into the hills to assist people who were cut off from getting to other help by fallen trees. The ship also used its radio systems to broadcast news and music to the island to inform the population of what was being done and how to get assistance. This was the first time a [[Royal Navy]] ship had provided a public broadcast news service.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n===United States===\nDespite the casualties and damages attributed to David, the storm's effects were not as bad as in other countries. In particular, South Florida escaped relatively lightly. Because of this, then NHC Director [[Neil Frank]] was accused of overly stirring up panic before the arrival of David: two local psychiatrists even claimed that the experience would make residents more complacent towards future storms. However, the NHC defended their methods, with Frank stating: \"If we hadn't [''raised public alarm''] and our predictions had been more accurate, the consequences would have been disastrous.\"<ref name=\"palm\"/>\nOne reporter who covered Hurricane David was Dick Baumbach, a journalist with TODAY newspaper, now known as ''[[Florida Today]]''.  He along with news photographer Scott Maclay followed the path of the hurricane from Miami to Central Florida.  In Cocoa Beach, Baumbach decided to ride out the hurricane in his home with two other journalists.  While it was a difficult and trying experience all three reporters survived and ended up winning numerous awards. The hurricane also interrupted the filming of the movie ''[[Caddyshack]]'' that was taking place at the Rolling Hills Country Club in Fort Lauderdale.\n\n===Retirement===\n{{See also|List of retired Atlantic hurricane names}}\nThe name David was retired following this storm because of its devastation and high death toll, and will never be used again for an [[North Atlantic tropical cyclone|Atlantic hurricane]], making it the first male hurricane name in the Atlantic Ocean to be retired.

A [[Cape Verde hurricane]] that reached Category&nbsp;5 hurricane status on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]], David was the fourth named [[tropical cyclone]], second hurricane, and first major hurricane of the [[1979 Atlantic hurricane season]], traversing through the [[Leeward Islands]], [[Greater Antilles]], and [[East Coast of the United States]] during late August and early September. David was the first hurricane to affect the [[Lesser Antilles]] since [[Hurricane Inez]] in [[1966 Atlantic hurricane season|1966]]. With winds of 175&nbsp;mph (280&nbsp;km/h), David was the only storm of Category&nbsp;5 intensity to make landfall on the [[Dominican Republic]] in the 20th century and the deadliest since the [[1930 Dominican Republic Hurricane]], San Zenon, killing over 2,000&nbsp;people in its path.

David turned to the northwest along the western periphery of the subtropical ridge, and re-intensified to a Category&nbsp;2 hurricane while over the [[Bahamas]], where it caused heavy damage. Despite initial forecasts of a projected landfall in [[Miami, Florida]], the hurricane turned to the north-northwest just before landfall to strike near [[West Palm Beach, Florida]] on September 3. It paralleled the Florida coastline just inland until emerging into the western Atlantic Ocean at [[New Smyrna Beach, Florida]] later on September 3. David continued to the north-northwest, and made its final landfall just south of [[Savannah, Georgia]] as a minimal hurricane on September 5.

By two months after the storm, assistance pledges amounted to over $37&nbsp;million (1979 US$) from various groups around the world.

Sailing through mountainous seas, ''Fife'' docked in the main harbor at Roseau without assistance, and was the only outside help for several days. The crew provided work details and medical parties to offer assistance to the island and concentrated on the hospital buildings, the airstrip, and restoring power and water. The ship's helicopter (called ''Humphrey'') took medical aid into the hills to assist people who were cut off from getting to other help by fallen trees. The ship also used its radio systems to broadcast news and music to the island to inform the population of what was being done and how to get assistance. This was the first time a [[Royal Navy]] ship had provided a public broadcast news service.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n===United States===\nDespite the casualties and damages attributed to David, the storm's effects were not as bad as in other countries. In particular, South Florida escaped relatively lightly. Because of this, then NHC Director [[Neil Frank]] was accused of overly stirring up panic before the arrival of David: two local psychiatrists even claimed that the experience would make residents more complacent towards future storms. However, the NHC defended their methods, with Frank stating: \"If we hadn't [''raised public alarm''] and our predictions had been more accurate, the consequences would have been disastrous.\"<ref name=\"palm\"/>\nOne reporter who covered Hurricane David was Dick Baumbach, a journalist with TODAY newspaper, now known as ''[[Florida Today]]''.  He along with news photographer Scott Maclay followed the path of the hurricane from Miami to Central Florida.  In Cocoa Beach, Baumbach decided to ride out the hurricane in his home with two other journalists.  While it was a difficult and trying experience all three reporters survived and ended up winning numerous awards. The hurricane also interrupted the filming of the movie ''[[Caddyshack]]'' that was taking place at the Rolling Hills Country Club in Fort Lauderdale.\n\n===Retirement===\n{{See also|List of retired Atlantic hurricane names}}\nThe name David was retired following this storm because of its devastation and high death toll, and will never be used again for an [[North Atlantic tropical cyclone|Atlantic hurricane]], making it the first male hurricane name in the Atlantic Ocean to be retired.

Despite only being convicted for 4 murders, Spesivtsev confessed to 19 murders that he was accused of by police, and based on evidence is believed to have committed over 80 killings as early as 1991.\n\n==Early life==\nAlexander Nikolayevich Spesivtsev was born 1 March 1970, and raised in an apartment on Pionerskiy Prospekt in central [[Novokuznetsk]], the largest city in [[Kemerovo Oblast]], [[RSFSR]], Soviet Union. He was underweight at birth but survived, although he was frequently ill afterwards. During childhood Spesivtsev was considered unsocial, did not have friends, and was bullied while at school. His mother, Lyudmila Spesivtseva, worked at a nearby school and the prosecutor's office and was very affectionate towards her son. His father was an abusive alcoholic, who abandoned the family. Spesivtsev and his mother held a strong but unusual relationship, as Lyudmila would regularly show her son photographs of corpses from books about criminal cases at a very young age, and the two shared a bed until Spesivtsev was 12. Growing up Spesivtsev showed increasing sadistic tendencies, and in 1988 met his first girlfriend. Ostensibly poetic by nature, they often went for walks together; but the fa\u00e7ade didn't last. Arguments led to her breaking up with him, which Spesivstev did not accept. He kidnapped her, and tortured her for a month in his apartment, until she died of [[Sepsis]]. For this, at the age of 18 Spesivstev was assigned to the [[Oryol]] Special Psychiatric Hospital (\u041e\u0440\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0441\u0438\u0445\u0438\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u043b\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0431\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435).\n\n==Crimes==\nThough in official databases he was (then) still listed as undergoing treatment, in 1991 he was discharged. Once out, he began associating with transients and beggars, and fermented a deep-seated hatred of street children; whom he viewed as a byproduct of Russia's emerging democracy. Spesivstev was likewise particularly embittered by an episode during his commitment at the Oryol Hospital, in which he asked another patient to insert a metal ball into his urethra to make him more virile. This had the opposite effect, causing erectile dysfunction and genital pains.\n\nAlexander, then Lyudmila began to lure victims into their apartment, chosen at random, where Alexander would torture and eventually kill them. Unaccompanied street children, attending discoth\u00e8ques and playing in construction sites had become commonplace in the impoverished city of Novokuznetsk since the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], and they became his main target. The bodies of victims would sometimes be cannibalized<ref name=\"TB\" /> Lyudmila would dispose of unwanted remains by throwing them from buckets into the [[Aba River (Russia)|Aba River]], late at night.<ref name=\"vesti\" />\n\n==Investigation==\nThe first sign of his victims arose when the gangrenous severed heads, torsos, and arms of unidentifiable children were found washed up on the banks of the River Aba. It was not immediately believed there was a serial killer, and only after several large groups of unattended children disappeared was a serial mass murderer suspected as being active in the city.\n\nOtherwise, investigators in the regional Directorate of Internal Affairs suspected that organ smugglers were acting within the city's boundaries. Several criminal gangs from the Caucusus region were active in Novokuznetsk at the time, and police searched the baggage of outward flights. Additionally, several hundred internal troops and police officers were deployed to  search for the killer; at some point thought to be [[Oleg Rylkov]].\n\n==Arrest and sentencing==\nWitness statements following the disappearance of several girls who were seen leaving a store with his mother helped police identify her. Her son was officially listed as undergoing a course of treatment at a psychiatric hospital. One morning, the neighborhood police officer and a plumber complained that a resident refused to let them in his apartment to relieve a clog. The resident claimed he was mentally ill and kept in his apartment. This alarmed police, as her son was ostensibly still at the hospital in Oryol.\n\nThe two men forced their way into his apartment, where they smelt an intense and putrid odor, resembling unspecified rotting. A woman bleeding from a severe stab wound to the chest, and a decapitated, de-limbed torso was uncovered in the bathtub. Spesivtsev escaped \"at the final moment\" via the building's roof. He was arrested within the week, found at his drobe; cold and without food. Lyudmila were arrested three days before on October 27, 1996.<ref>[https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/227031 \u00a0\u0421\u0435\u043c\u044c\u044f \u043a\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0431\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0432]</ref>\n\nSpesivtsev kept a diary detailing some of his crimes and did not deny his actions when captured.<ref name=\"vesti\" /> However, he confessed only to 19 murders and boasted with crimes, that couldn't be proven. During the search of his apartment 82 articles of bloody clothing, nearly 40 jewelry items and some photos of unknown people, who were possibly unproven victims, were found. Police experts later concluded the garments belonged to the 19 victims.

Despite only being convicted for 4 murders, Spesivtsev confessed to 19 murders that he was accused of by police, and based on evidence is believed to have committed over 80 killings as early as 1991.\n\n==Early life==\nAlexander Nikolayevich Spesivtsev was born 1 March 1970, and raised in an apartment on Pionerskiy Prospekt in central [[Novokuznetsk]], the largest city in [[Kemerovo Oblast]], [[RSFSR]], Soviet Union. He was underweight at birth but survived, although he was frequently ill afterwards. During childhood Spesivtsev was considered unsocial, did not have friends, and was bullied while at school. His mother, Lyudmila Spesivtseva, worked at a nearby school and the prosecutor's office and was very affectionate towards her son. His father was an abusive alcoholic, who abandoned the family. Spesivtsev and his mother held a strong but unusual relationship, as Lyudmila would regularly show her son photographs of corpses from books about criminal cases at a very young age, and the two shared a bed until Spesivtsev was 12. Growing up Spesivtsev showed increasing sadistic tendencies, and in 1988 met his first girlfriend. Ostensibly poetic by nature, they often went for walks together; but the fa\u00e7ade didn't last. Arguments led to her breaking up with him, which Spesivstev did not accept. He kidnapped her, and tortured her for a month in his apartment, until she died of [[Sepsis]]. For this, at the age of 18 Spesivstev was assigned to the [[Oryol]] Special Psychiatric Hospital (\u041e\u0440\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0441\u0438\u0445\u0438\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u043b\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0431\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435).\n\n==Crimes==\nThough in official databases he was (then) still listed as undergoing treatment, in 1991 he was discharged. Once out, he began associating with transients and beggars, and fermented a deep-seated hatred of street children; whom he viewed as a byproduct of Russia's emerging democracy. Spesivstev was likewise particularly embittered by an episode during his commitment at the Oryol Hospital, in which he asked another patient to insert a metal ball into his urethra to make him more virile. This had the opposite effect, causing erectile dysfunction and genital pains.\n\nAlexander, then Lyudmila began to lure victims into their apartment, chosen at random, where Alexander would torture and eventually kill them. Unaccompanied street children, attending discoth\u00e8ques and playing in construction sites had become commonplace in the impoverished city of Novokuznetsk since the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], and they became his main target. The bodies of victims would sometimes be cannibalized<ref name=\"TB\" /> Lyudmila would dispose of unwanted remains by throwing them from buckets into the [[Aba River (Russia)|Aba River]], late at night.<ref name=\"vesti\" />\n\n==Investigation==\nThe first sign of his victims arose when the gangrenous severed heads, torsos, and arms of unidentifiable children were found washed up on the banks of the River Aba. It was not immediately believed there was a serial killer, and only after several large groups of unattended children disappeared was a serial mass murderer suspected as being active in the city.\n\nOtherwise, investigators in the regional Directorate of Internal Affairs suspected that organ smugglers were acting within the city's boundaries. Several criminal gangs from the Caucusus region were active in Novokuznetsk at the time, and police searched the baggage of outward flights. Additionally, several hundred internal troops and police officers were deployed to  search for the killer; at some point thought to be [[Oleg Rylkov]].\n\n==Arrest and sentencing==\nWitness statements following the disappearance of several girls who were seen leaving a store with his mother helped police identify her. Her son was officially listed as undergoing a course of treatment at a psychiatric hospital. One morning, the neighborhood police officer and a plumber complained that a resident refused to let them in his apartment to relieve a clog. The resident claimed he was mentally ill and kept in his apartment. This alarmed police, as her son was ostensibly still at the hospital in Oryol.\n\nThe two men forced their way into his apartment, where they smelt an intense and putrid odor, resembling unspecified rotting. A woman bleeding from a severe stab wound to the chest, and a decapitated, de-limbed torso was uncovered in the bathtub. Spesivtsev escaped \"at the final moment\" via the building's roof. He was arrested within the week, found at his drobe; cold and without food. Lyudmila were arrested three days before on October 27, 1996.<ref>[https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/227031 \u00a0\u0421\u0435\u043c\u044c\u044f \u043a\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0431\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0432]</ref>\n\nSpesivtsev kept a diary detailing some of his crimes and did not deny his actions when captured.<ref name=\"vesti\" /> However, he confessed only to 19 murders and boasted with crimes, that couldn't be proven. During the search of his apartment 82 articles of bloody clothing, nearly 40 jewelry items and some photos of unknown people, who were possibly unproven victims, were found. Police experts later concluded the garments belonged to the 19 victims. He was ruled insane by a court and committed to a psychiatric hospital, and had previously been confined to a mental institution for 3 years after torturing and killing his girlfriend.<ref name=\"vesti\" /><ref name=\"TB\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com.au/newspapers?id=hYYUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=6QMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5590,1874764&dq=alexander-spesivtsev&hl=en|title=Insane Russian accused of killing, eating people|date=6 October 1999|publisher=[[Toledo Blade]]|accessdate=22 January 2010}}</ref> The only living witness and Spesivtsev's last victim, 15-year-old Olga Galtseva, died the following day after being discovered.<ref name=\"vesti\">{{cite video|year=2010|script-title=ru:\u0421\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442: \u043f\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b \u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0436\u0438\u043c\u0430|url=http://www.vesti.ru/only_video.html?vid=277095|language=Russian|publisher=[[Vesti (TV channel)|Vesti]]|accessdate=June 11, 2012|time=16:32}}</ref>\n\nHe today resides at the Kamyshin Regional Hospital, a facility complete with full meals and metal bars.

It is the second installment in the [[Indiana Jones (franchise)|''Indiana Jones'' franchise]] and a [[prequel]] to the 1981 film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', featuring [[Harrison Ford]] reprising his role as the title character. After arriving in [[India]], [[Indiana Jones]] is asked by desperate villagers to find a mystical stone and rescue their children from a [[Thuggee]] cult practicing [[child slavery]], [[black magic]] and ritualistic [[human sacrifice]] in honor of the goddess [[Kali]].\n\nNot wishing to feature the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] as the villains again, [[George Lucas]], executive producer and co-writer, decided to regard this film as a prequel. Three [[plot device]]s were rejected before Lucas wrote a [[film treatment]] that resembled the final storyline. [[Lawrence Kasdan]], Lucas' collaborator on ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'', turned down the offer to write the script, and [[Willard Huyck]] and [[Gloria Katz]] were hired as his replacements, who had previously worked with Lucas. The film was released to financial success but initial reviews were mixed, criticizing its dark tone. However, critical opinion has improved since 1984, citing the film's intensity and imagination. In response to some of the more violent sequences in the film, and with similar complaints about ''[[Gremlins]]'', Spielberg suggested that the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) alter its [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|rating system]], which it did within two months of the film's release, creating a new [[PG-13]] rating.<ref name=Parker />{{efn|name=fn1|Contrary to popular belief, ''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'' and ''Gremlins'' were both released in the U.S. with a PG (not PG-13) rating,<ref>{{cite web |title=Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) |url=https://filmratings.com/Search?filmTitle=indiana+jones+and+the+temple+of+doom&x=16&y=11 |website=Filmratings.com |publisher=MPAA |accessdate=January 27, 2019 |quote=Rating: PG}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Gremlins (1984) |url=https://filmratings.com/Search?filmTitle=GREMLINS&x=0&y=0 |website=Filmratings.com |publisher=MPAA |accessdate=January 27, 2019 |quote=Rating: PG}}</ref> although controversy surrounding the two films did lead to the subsequent creation of the PG-13 rating.

With his eleven-year-old Chinese sidekick Short Round and the nightclub singer Willie Scott in tow, Indy flees Shanghai on an airplane that, unbeknownst to them, is owned by Lao Che. While the three of them are asleep on the plane, the pilots dump the fuel and parachute out, leaving the plane to crash over the [[Himalayas]]. Indy, Shorty, and Willie discover the sabotage and narrowly manage to escape by jumping out of the plane on an inflatable raft just before it crashes into the mountainside. They ride down the mountain slopes and fall into a raging river, eventually arriving at the village of Mayapore in northern [[British Raj|India]]. The impoverished villagers believe the three to have been sent by [[Shiva]] to retrieve the sacred [[lingam]] stone stolen from their shrine, as well as the community's missing children, from evil forces in the nearby Pankot Palace. During the journey to Pankot, Indy hypothesizes that the stone may be one of the five fabled Sankara stones that promise fortune and glory.\n\nThe trio receives a warm welcome from the Prime Minister of Pankot Palace, Chattar Lal. The visitors are allowed to stay for the night as guests, during which they attend a lavish but grotesque banquet given by the young [[Maharaja]], Zalim Singh. Lal rebuffs Indy's questions about the villagers' claims and his theory that the ancient [[Thuggee]] cult is responsible for their troubles. Later that night, Indy is attacked by an assassin, leading Indy, Willie, and Shorty to believe that something is wrong. After Indy kills the assassin, they discover a series of tunnels hidden behind a statue in Willie's room and set out to explore them, overcoming a number of booby-twaps along the way.\n\nThe trio reaches an underground temple where the Thuggees worship [[Kali]] with human sacrifice. They watch as the Thuggees chain one of their victims in a cage, and the high priest Mola Ram uses his evil magic to rip out the victim's still-beating heart. While the victim is still alive, he is slowly lowered into a lava pit, burning him alive, with his heart held in Mola Ram's hand burning as well. They discover that Mola Ram, who has plans for world domination, and the Thuggees are in possession of three of the five Sankara stones, which were hidden in the catacombs by a priest when the British invaded, and have enslaved the children to mine for the last two, as well as to mine jewels to fund their operations. As Indy tries to retrieve the stones, he, Willie, and Shorty are captured and separated. Indy is [[Flagellation|whipped]] and forced to drink a potion called the Blood of Kali, causing him to enter a trance-like state and mindlessly serve the Thuggees. Willie is prepared for sacrifice, while Shorty is whipped and put to work in the mines alongside the children. Shorty breaks free and escapes back into the temple, where he burns Indy with a torch to bring him back to his senses. After fighting off the guards and defeating Lal, Indy stops Willie's cage and cranks it out of the pit just in time to save her from the fire, while Mola Ram escapes via a trapdoor under the Sankara stones' altar. Indy retrieves the stones, and the three return to the mines to free the children. As Indy fights a hulking overseer, Singh\u2014also under Mola Ram's control\u2014tries to cripple him with a voodoo doll. Shorty knocks the doll away and burns him to break the trance, and a restored Indy escapes and leaves the overseer to die in a steamroller. Singh then tells Shorty how to get out of the mine.\n\nThe trio escape from the temple in a minecart, pursued by Thuggees, while Mola Ram orders a huge water cistern dumped in an attempt to flood them out. After barely escaping the deluge, they are again ambushed by Mola Ram and his henchmen on a rope bridge high above a crocodile-infested river. Indy cuts the bridge in half with a sword, leaving them to hang on for their lives. As he and Mola Ram struggle over the stones, he invokes the name of [[Shiva]] by proclaiming him to be a traitor, causing them to glow white-hot. Mola Ram burns his hand on the stones, causing him to lose his grip and fall to be devoured alive by the crocodiles below. Losing two, Indy catches the last stone safely and climbs up just as a company of [[British Indian Army]] riflemen, summoned by Singh, arrive and open fire on the Thuggee archers trying to shoot Indy. Gaining the upper hand, the British army has them surrounded forcing the Thuggee to surrender. Indy, Willie, and Shorty return to Mayapore with the children and give the missing stone back to the villagers.\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Indiana Jones characters}}\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Indiana Jones]]: An [[archaeology|archaeologist]] adventurer who is asked by a desperate Indian village to retrieve a mysterious stone and rescue the missing village children.

Capshaw learned to sing in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] and took [[tap dance]] lessons. However the dress was fitted so tightly that Capshaw was not able to dance in it. Made by [[Barbara Matera (costume designer)|Barbara Matera]] out of original 1920s and 1930s beads, the dress was one of a kind. The opening dance number was actually the last scene to be shot, but the dress did feature in some earlier location shots in Sri Lanka, drying on a nearby tree. Unfortunately an [[elephant]] had started to eat it, tearing the whole back of the dress. Consequently, some emergency repair work had to be done by Matera with what remained of the original beads, and it was [[costume design]]er [[Anthony Powell (designer)|Anthony Powell]] who had to fill in the insurance forms.

However, there have been more than one of these dresses on display at the same time in different countries, so this story cannot be entirely true - from late 2014, a dress was on display at the Hollywood Costume exhibition in Los Angeles (exhibition ran from October 2, 2014 - March 2, 2015).

It is the second installment in the [[Indiana Jones (franchise)|''Indiana Jones'' franchise]] and a [[prequel]] to the 1981 film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', featuring [[Harrison Ford]] reprising his role as the title character. After arriving in [[India]], [[Indiana Jones]] is asked by desperate villagers to find a mystical stone and rescue their children from a [[Thuggee]] cult practicing [[child slavery]], [[black magic]] and ritualistic [[human sacrifice]] in honor of the goddess [[Kali]].\n\nNot wishing to feature the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] as the villains again, [[George Lucas]], executive producer and co-writer, decided to regard this film as a prequel. Three [[plot device]]s were rejected before Lucas wrote a [[film treatment]] that resembled the final storyline. [[Lawrence Kasdan]], Lucas' collaborator on ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'', turned down the offer to write the script, and [[Willard Huyck]] and [[Gloria Katz]] were hired as his replacements, who had previously worked with Lucas. The film was released to financial success but initial reviews were mixed, criticizing its dark tone. However, critical opinion has improved since 1984, citing the film's intensity and imagination. In response to some of the more violent sequences in the film, and with similar complaints about ''[[Gremlins]]'', Spielberg suggested that the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) alter its [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|rating system]], which it did within two months of the film's release, creating a new [[PG-13]] rating.<ref name=Parker />{{efn|name=fn1|Contrary to popular belief, ''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'' and ''Gremlins'' were both released in the U.S. with a PG (not PG-13) rating,<ref>{{cite web |title=Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) |url=https://filmratings.com/Search?filmTitle=indiana+jones+and+the+temple+of+doom&x=16&y=11 |website=Filmratings.com |publisher=MPAA |accessdate=January 27, 2019 |quote=Rating: PG}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Gremlins (1984) |url=https://filmratings.com/Search?filmTitle=GREMLINS&x=0&y=0 |website=Filmratings.com |publisher=MPAA |accessdate=January 27, 2019 |quote=Rating: PG}}</ref> although controversy surrounding the two films did lead to the subsequent creation of the PG-13 rating.

With his eleven-year-old Chinese sidekick Short Round and the nightclub singer Willie Scott in tow, Indy flees Shanghai on an airplane that, unbeknownst to them, is owned by Lao Che. While the three of them are asleep on the plane, the pilots dump the fuel and parachute out, leaving the plane to crash over the [[Himalayas]]. Indy, Shorty, and Willie discover the sabotage and narrowly manage to escape by jumping out of the plane on an inflatable raft just before it crashes into the mountainside. They ride down the mountain slopes and fall into a raging river, eventually arriving at the village of Mayapore in northern [[British Raj|India]]. The impoverished villagers believe the three to have been sent by [[Shiva]] to retrieve the sacred [[lingam]] stone stolen from their shrine, as well as the community's missing children, from evil forces in the nearby Pankot Palace. During the journey to Pankot, Indy hypothesizes that the stone may be one of the five fabled Sankara stones that promise fortune and glory.\n\nThe trio receives a warm welcome from the Prime Minister of Pankot Palace, Chattar Lal. The visitors are allowed to stay for the night as guests, during which they attend a lavish but grotesque banquet given by the young [[Maharaja]], Zalim Singh. Lal rebuffs Indy's questions about the villagers' claims and his theory that the ancient [[Thuggee]] cult is responsible for their troubles. Later that night, Indy is attacked by an assassin, leading Indy, Willie, and Shorty to believe that something is wrong. After Indy kills the assassin, they discover a series of tunnels hidden behind a statue in Willie's room and set out to explore them, overcoming a number of booby-traps along the way.\n\nThe trio reaches an underground temple where the Thuggees worship [[Kali]] with human sacrifice. They watch as the Thuggees chain one of their victims in a cage, and the high priest Mola Ram uses his evil magic to rip out the victim's still-beating heart. While the victim is still alive, he is slowly lowered into a lava pit, burning him alive, with his heart held in Mola Ram's hand burning as well. They discover that Mola Ram, who has plans for world domination, and the Thuggees are in possession of three of the five Sankara stones, which were hidden in the catacombs by a priest when the British invaded, and have enslaved the children to mine for the last two, as well as to mine jewels to fund their operations. As Indy tries to retrieve the stones, he, Willie, and Shorty are captured and separated. Indy is [[Flagellation|whipped]] and forced to drink a potion called the Blood of Kali, causing him to enter a trance-like state and mindlessly serve the Thuggees. Willie is prepared for sacrifice, while Shorty is whipped and put to work in the mines alongside the children. Shorty breaks free and escapes back into the temple, where he burns Indy with a torch to bring him back to his senses. After fighting off the guards and defeating Lal, Indy stops Willie's cage and cranks it out of the pit just in time to save her from the fire, while Mola Ram escapes via a trapdoor under the Sankara stones' altar. Indy retrieves the stones, and the three return to the mines to free the children. As Indy fights a hulking overseer, Singh\u2014also under Mola Ram's control\u2014tries to cripple him with a voodoo doll. Shorty knocks the doll away and burns him to break the trance, and a restored Indy escapes and leaves the overseer to die in a steamroller. Singh then tells Shorty how to get out of the mine.\n\nThe trio escape from the temple in a minecart, pursued by Thuggees, while Mola Ram orders a huge water cistern dumped in an attempt to flood them out. After barely escaping the deluge, they are again ambushed by Mola Ram and his henchmen on a rope bridge high above a crocodile-infested river. Indy cuts the bridge in half with a sword, leaving them to hang on for their lives. As he and Mola Ram struggle over the stones, he invokes the name of [[Shiva]] by proclaiming him to be a traitor, causing them to glow white-hot. Mola Ram burns his hand on the stones, causing him to lose his grip and fall to be devoured alive by the crocodiles below. Losing two, Indy catches the last stone safely and climbs up just as a company of [[British Indian Army]] riflemen, summoned by Singh, arrive and open fire on the Thuggee archers trying to shoot Indy. Gaining the upper hand, the British army has them surrounded forcing the Thuggee to surrender. Indy, Willie, and Shorty return to Mayapore with the children and give the missing stone back to the villagers.\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Indiana Jones characters}}\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Indiana Jones]]: An [[archaeology|archaeologist]] adventurer who is asked by a desperate Indian village to retrieve a mysterious stone and rescue the missing village children.

Capshaw learned to sing in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] and took [[tap dance]] lessons. However the dress was fitted so tightly that Capshaw was not able to dance in it. Made by [[Barbara Matera (costume designer)|Barbara Matera]] out of original 1920s and 1930s beads, the dress was one of a kind. The opening dance number was actually the last scene to be shot, but the dress did feature in some earlier location shots in Sri Lanka, drying on a nearby tree. Unfortunately an [[elephant]] had started to eat it, tearing the whole back of the dress. Consequently, some emergency repair work had to be done by Matera with what remained of the original beads, and it was [[costume design]]er [[Anthony Powell (designer)|Anthony Powell]] who had to fill in the insurance forms. As to the reason for damage, he had no option but to put \"dress eaten by elephant\".<ref name=making/> \n\nIn a 2003 documentary on the making of the film (first released when the original trilogy made its debut on DVD), costume designer Anthony Powell stated that only one evening dress was made for Capshaw due to the limited amount of original 1920's and 1930's beads and sequins (story above). However, there have been more than one of these dresses on display at the same time in different countries, so this story cannot be entirely true - from late 2014, a dress was on display at the Hollywood Costume exhibition in Los Angeles (exhibition ran from October 2, 2014 - March 2, 2015). At the very same time, the travelling \"Indiana Jones: Adventure of Archaeology\" exhibition was on display in Edmonton in Canada (October 11, 2014 - April 6, 2015) and there featured another of the red & gold dresses. It has also been confirmed by an embroiderer working at Barbara Matera Ltd at the time, that three dresses were in fact made initially - One for Kate, one for the stunt double, and one \"just in case\".\n\nProduction designer [[Norman Reynolds]] could not return for ''Temple of Doom'' because of his commitment to ''[[Return to Oz]]''.

Sopocko was a professor of theology at the [[University of Vilnius]] and introduced Faustina to Kazimirowski, who was a professor of art there and had painted other religious images. Faustina gave Kazimirowski specific instructions about the appearance and posture of the image, which she said she had received from Jesus Christ in a vision. Sopocko himself posed as Jesus for the image, wearing an [[alb]], and both he and Faustina regularly visited the painter\u2018s workshop. The final painting satisfied neither Sopocko nor Faustina, who later wrote that Jesus told her it was not that important that the picture be beautiful, and that the true beauty would be the blessing he would bestow upon people by means of the painting.<ref name=divinemercyfilm>{{cite AV media | people=DiSilva, Daniel (Director) | date=2016-03-23 | title=The Original Image of Divine Mercy | medium=Motion picture | location=USA | publisher=Springtime Productions}}</ref>\n\nAfter its completion in 1934, the Kazimirowski painting first hung in the [[Franciscans|Bernardine Sisters']] [[convent]] near the [[Church of St. Michael, Vilnius|church of St. Michael]], where Sopo\u0107ko was a rector. In her diary, Faustina wrote that Jesus told her to inform her confessor that the proper place for the painting was in a church, not in the hallway of a convent.

The painting remained in the disused church building until 1951, when two pious women from Vilnius, Bron\u0117 Miniotait\u0117 and Janina Rodzevi\u010d, bought the canvas from a guard and concealed it in an attic for several years. Later, they gave it to the parish priest at the [[Dominican Church of the Holy Spirit]] for safekeeping, who chose not to display it in the church. Fr. Sopocko, who had relocated to Poland but was unable to take the painting with him, expressed concern about it to his friend Fr. J\u00f3zef Grasewicz, who obtained the painting and moved it to his own parish church in Nova Ruda, [[Belarus]]. There, it was displayed and venerated by the local parishioners. In 1970, the Soviets closed that church and used it as a storage warehouse, but left the painting hanging in the disused church, where parishioners continued to venerate it in secret. In 1986, Fr. Grasewicz arranged for the painting to be replaced by a copy and the original to be secretly transported back to the Church of the Holy Spirit in Vilnius, where it underwent a restoration that significantly changed its appearance, and was then displayed and venerated in the church. In 2003, the painting, which had deteriorated due to exposure, attempts at cleaning, and the previous restoration, was professionally restored to its original look. In 2005 it was moved to its current location above the main altar in the [[Sanctuary of the Divine Mercy, Vilnius|Sanctuary of Divine Mercy]] in Vilnius.<ref name=divinemercyfilm /><ref name=historyoffirstimage />\n\nIn 2016, a documentary film, entitled ''The Original Image of Divine Mercy'', was released that told the story of the original Divine Mercy painting and its survival over the decades.

Through painting this picture, Hy\u0142a expressed his gratitude for the survival of his family during [[World War II]].\n\nHy\u0142a was given the descriptions from Faustina's diary by the nuns at the convent, and a small copy of the first painting. Hy\u0142a's image is somewhat different from Kazimirowski's, as the former figured Jesus as a \"Divine Physician\", walking the earth and healing people. He has Jesus approaching the viewer instead of merely standing. Christ's right hand is lifted up high in benediction, and He is looking into the eyes of the viewer. The original version of this painting had a country landscape in the background, which was removed in a later replica as it was deemed \"non-liturgical\".\n\nThe Hy\u0142a rendition is also called the \"Krak\u00f3w Divine Mercy Image\" because it is kept in the sanctuary at [[\u0141agiewniki-Borek Fa\u0142\u0119cki|Krak\u00f3w-\u0141agiewniki]].\n\n===Other versions===\n[[File:Divine Mercy Christ - 1.JPG|thumb|Statue of Merciful Jesus in [[Divine Mercy Shrine (Misamis Oriental)]]]]\nBefore Adolf Hy\u0142a offered his votive painting, the sisters had commissioned [[Stanis\u0142aw Kaczor-Batowski|Stanis\u0142aw Batowski]] to paint a third version. This was lost in a fire, and Batowski painted a fourth painting which arrived at the convent at almost the same time as Hy\u0142a's.

Sopocko was a professor of theology at the [[University of Vilnius]] and introduced Faustina to Kazimirowski, who was a professor of art there and had painted other religious images. Faustina gave Kazimirowski specific instructions about the appearance and posture of the image, which she said she had received from Jesus Christ in a vision. Sopocko himself posed as Jesus for the image, wearing an [[alb]], and both he and Faustina regularly visited the painter\u2018s workshop. The final painting satisfied neither Sopocko nor Faustina, who later wrote that Jesus told her it was not that important that the picture be beautiful, and that the true beauty would be the blessing he would bestow upon people by means of the painting.<ref name=divinemercyfilm>{{cite AV media | people=DiSilva, Daniel (Director) | date=2016-03-23 | title=The Original Image of Divine Mercy | medium=Motion picture | location=USA | publisher=Springtime Productions}}</ref>\n\nAfter its completion in 1934, the Kazimirowski painting first hung in the [[Franciscans|Bernardine Sisters']] [[convent]] near the [[Church of St. Michael, Vilnius|church of St. Michael]], where Sopo\u0107ko was a rector. In her diary, Faustina wrote that Jesus told her to inform her confessor that the proper place for the painting was in a church, not in the hallway of a convent.

The painting remained in the disused church building until 1951, when two pious women from Vilnius, Bron\u0117 Miniotait\u0117 and Janina Rodzevi\u010d, bought the canvas from a guard and concealed it in an attic for several years. Later, they gave it to the parish priest at the [[Dominican Church of the Holy Spirit]] for safekeeping, who chose not to display it in the church. Fr. Sopocko, who had relocated to Poland but was unable to take the painting with him, expressed concern about it to his friend Fr. J\u00f3zef Grasewicz, who obtained the painting and moved it to his own parish church in Nova Ruda, [[Belarus]]. There, it was displayed and venerated by the local parishioners. In 1970, the Soviets closed that church and used it as a storage warehouse, but left the painting hanging in the disused church, where parishioners continued to venerate it in secret. In 1986, Fr. Grasewicz arranged for the painting to be replaced by a copy and the original to be secretly transported back to the Church of the Holy Spirit in Vilnius, where it underwent a restoration that significantly changed its appearance and was then displayed and venerated in the church. In 2003, the painting, which had deteriorated due to exposure, attempts at cleaning, and the previous restoration, was professionally restored to its original look. In 2005 it was moved to its current location above the main altar in the [[Sanctuary of the Divine Mercy, Vilnius|Sanctuary of Divine Mercy]] in Vilnius.<ref name=divinemercyfilm /><ref name=historyoffirstimage />\n\nIn 2016, a documentary film, entitled ''The Original Image of Divine Mercy'', was released that told the story of the original Divine Mercy painting and its survival over the decades. Made with the cooperation of the [[Archdiocese of Vilnius]], the film included interviews with [[Jim Gaffigan]], [[Robert Barron|Bishop Robert Barron]], [[Harry Connick Jr.]], and [[Gintaras Grusas|Archbishop Gintaras Grusas]], who also served as executive producer.<ref name=divinemercyfilm /> \n\n=== Hy\u0142a painting ===\nAnother painting of the Divine Mercy was made by [[Adolf Hy\u0142a]], as a [[Ex-voto|votive offering]]. Through painting this picture, Hy\u0142a expressed his gratitude for the survival of his family during [[World War II]].\n\nHy\u0142a was given the descriptions from Faustina's diary by the nuns at the convent, and a small copy of the first painting. Hy\u0142a's image is somewhat different from Kazimirowski's, as the former figured Jesus as a \"Divine Physician\", walking the earth and healing people. He has Jesus approaching the viewer instead of merely standing. Christ's right hand is lifted up high in benediction, and He is looking into the eyes of the viewer. The original version of this painting had a country landscape in the background, which was removed in a later replica as it was deemed \"non-liturgical\".\n\nThe Hy\u0142a rendition is also called the \"Krak\u00f3w Divine Mercy Image\" because it is kept in the sanctuary at [[\u0141agiewniki-Borek Fa\u0142\u0119cki|Krak\u00f3w-\u0141agiewniki]].\n\n===Other versions===\n[[File:Divine Mercy Christ - 1.JPG|thumb|Statue of Merciful Jesus in [[Divine Mercy Shrine (Misamis Oriental)]]]]\nBefore Adolf Hy\u0142a offered his votive painting, the sisters had commissioned [[Stanis\u0142aw Kaczor-Batowski|Stanis\u0142aw Batowski]] to paint a third version. This was lost in a fire, and Batowski painted a fourth painting which arrived at the convent at almost the same time as Hy\u0142a's.

There have been several types os research locally, ranging from the predominant study of the geology and sedimentology on the formation and associated layers, along with the geochemical, climatic, and ecosistemic research to set the different changes that have been documented along the formation. Paleogeography, paleontology, palynology, tectonics, and several other kinds of works have been done along the Formation. The most studied section has been the German, with the other being found as part of the Posidonia on late 1960-80s works, and most of them not covered yet.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 1800s ===\n[[File:Friedrich August von Quenstedt.jpg|thumb|right|Friedrich August von Quenstedt a German Mineralogist that studied the jurassic strata along Germany, including the Black Shales of the Posidonia Shale.]]\nThe first related studies with the Posidonia Shale Strata where done on the Early 1800.

It is the reference formation for this interval. The Posidonia Shale of [[Dotternhausen]] and [[Schesslitz]] is well dated on the basis of ammonite and microfossil biostratigraphy. The Lower Toarcian sections are subdivided into three ammonite biozones ([[Dactyloceras]] tenuicostatum, [[Harpoceras]] falciferum, and [[Hildoceras]] bifrons) and several subzones. The Posidonia Shale is considered to be the reference formation for the Lower Toarcian section.<ref>R\u00f6hl, H. J., & Schmid-R\u00f6hl, A. (2005).

There have been several types os research locally, ranging from the predominant study of the geology and sedimentology on the formation and associated layers, along with the geochemical, climatic, and ecosistemic research to set the different changes that have been documented along the formation. Paleogeography, paleontology, palynology, tectonics, and several other kinds of works have been done along the Formation. The most studied section has been the German, with the other being found as part of the Posidonia on late 1960-80s works, and most of them not covered yet.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 1800s ===\n[[File:Friedrich August von Quenstedt.jpg|thumb|right|Friedrich August von Quenstedt a German Mineralogist that studied the jurassic strata along Germany, including the Black Shales of the Posidonia Shale.]]\nThe first related studies with the Posidonia Shale Strata where done on the Early 1800.
