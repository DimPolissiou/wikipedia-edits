It runs {{convert|144|mi|km|0}} from its northwestern terminus at [[Interstate 90 in Washington|I-90]] in [[Ellensburg, Washington]], to its southeastern terminus at [[Interstate 84 in Oregon|I-84]] in [[Hermiston, Oregon]]. The highway passes through [[Yakima, Washington|Yakima]] and the [[Tri-Cities, Washington|Tri-Cities]], and is also part of the link between [[Seattle]] and [[Boise, Idaho]]. I-82 travels [[concurrency (road)|concurrently]] with [[U.S. Route 97 in Washington|U.S. Route 97]] (US&nbsp;97) between Ellensburg and [[Union Gap, Washington|Union Gap]]; [[U.S. Route 12 in Washington|US&nbsp;12]] from Yakima to the Tri-Cities; and [[U.S. Route 395|US&nbsp;395]] from [[Kennewick, Washington|Kennewick]] and [[Umatilla, Oregon]].\n\nI-82 primarily serves the [[Yakima River|Yakima Valley]] agricultural region, following the [[Yakima River|Yakima]] and [[Columbia River|Columbia]] rivers southeastward to the Tri-Cities. The highway enters the valley from the north by crossing the [[Manastash Ridge]], which separates Yakima from the [[Kittitas Valley]]. I-82 bypasses the Tri-Cities by traveling southwest around [[Richland, Washington|Richland]] and Kennewick, turning south to cross the Columbia River on the [[Umatilla Bridge]]. Its only [[List of auxiliary Interstate Highways|auxiliary route]], [[Interstate 182|I-182]], connects the highway to Richland and [[Pasco, Washington|Pasco]] in the Tri-Cities.\n\nThe I-82 corridor was originally used by several state and national highways, including the [[Inland Empire Highway]] and [[U.S. Route 410|US&nbsp;410]], which were built in the early 20th century. The federal government created I-82 in late 1957 to serve military facilities in the region, replacing an earlier designation for what is now I-84. The first section of I-82 to be constructed was the easterly bypass of Yakima, which opened in 1963 and was gradually extended north to Ellensburg by 1971. The Yakima Valley section, connecting Union Gap to [[Prosser, Washington|Prosser]], was constructed between 1977 and 1982.\n\nThe routing of the highway between Prosser and I-84 was very controversial with residents of the Tri-Cities area, who lobbied for a longer I-82 alignment to serve them. Oregon legislators and highway officials remained opposed to a routing that bypassed Umatilla, leading to several attempts at finding a compromise along the [[Wallula Gap]] or in other areas southeast of the Tri-Cities. In 1973, Oregon and Washington adopted a federal compromise to build I-82 through Umatilla and around the outskirts of the Tri-Cities with a spur route (I-182) to serve the area directly. The Tri-Cities section opened in 1986 while in Oregon, the final section of I-82 was completed in 1988. In the early 2000s, Oregon highway officials examined plans to extend I-82 further south through [[eastern Oregon]] and towards [[California]], but rejected them from further consideration.\n\n==Route description==\n\nI-82 travels {{convert|143.6|mi|km|0}}<ref name=\"FHWA log\"/> through a part of the [[Inland Northwest (United States)|Inland Northwest]] in a generally northwest\u2013southeast direction along the [[Yakima River|Yakima]] and [[Columbia River|Columbia]] rivers.<ref name=\"WSDOT-Map\">{{cite map |year=2014 |title=Washington State Highways 2014\u20132015 |scale=1:842,000 |url=https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2006/06/13/TouristMapFront_withoutHillshade.pdf |publisher=Washington State Department of Transportation |postscript=none |accessdate=June 17, 2018}}, with [https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Publications/HighwayMap/view.htm inset maps].</ref> The four-lane divided highway forms part of the link between [[Seattle]] and the inland West, which includes [[Boise, Idaho]] and [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, Utah]].<ref>{{cite web |date=March 29, 2018 |title=Corridor Sketch Summary \u2013 I-82: Union Gap to Oregon Border (Umatilla) |url=https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2018/02/05/CSS513-i82-UnionGap-OregonBorderUmatilla.pdf |publisher=Washington State Department of Transportation |accessdate=March 20, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |date=December 1972 |title=Draft Environmental Statement: Interstate 82/182, Prosser, Washington to Interstate 80N in Oregon |page=1 |publisher=Washington State Department of Highways, Oregon State Highway Division |oclc=16701863 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=heQ0AQAAMAAJ&pg=SA1-PA1#v=onepage |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Port of Grandview: Transportation |url=http://portofgrandview.org/transportation/ |publisher=[[Port of Grandview]] |accessdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref> I-82 is a component of the [[Interstate Highway System]] and is also designated as an important national highway under the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]].<ref>{{cite web |title=National Highway System Routes \u2013 Washington State |url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/mapsdata/travel/hpms/NHSRoutes.htm |publisher=Washington State Department of Transportation |accessdate=June 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite map |date=March 25, 2015 |title=National Highway System: Oregon |url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/nhs_maps/oregon/or_oregon.pdf |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |accessdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref> It is also listed as a Highway of Statewide Significance by the Washington state government.<ref>{{cite web |date=July 26, 2009 |title=Transportation Commission List of Highways of Statewide Significance |url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2006/03/16/HSSlist2009mod2.pdf |publisher=[[Washington State Transportation Commission]] |accessdate=June 17, 2018}}</ref> I-82 has one [[auxiliary Interstate Highway|auxiliary route]], [[Interstate 182|I-182]], a spur route that serves the [[Tri-Cities, Washington|Tri-Cities]] region.<ref>{{cite web |date=December 31, 2017 |title=Table 2: Auxiliary Routes of the Dwight D.

A variation of the route with a direct connection to I-82 near Hermiston would branch off at [[Madras, Oregon|Madras]] and travel northeastward through a mountainous region along [[Oregon Route 218|Route&nbsp;218]] and [[Oregon Route 207|Route&nbsp;207]].

It runs {{convert|144|mi|km|0}} from its northwestern terminus at [[Interstate 90 in Washington|I-90]] in [[Ellensburg, Washington]], to its southeastern terminus at [[Interstate 84 in Oregon|I-84]] in [[Hermiston, Oregon]]. The highway passes through [[Yakima, Washington|Yakima]] and the [[Tri-Cities, Washington|Tri-Cities]], and is also part of the link between [[Seattle]] and [[Boise, Idaho]]. I-82 travels [[concurrency (road)|concurrently]] with [[U.S. Route 97 in Washington|U.S. Route 97]] (US&nbsp;97) between Ellensburg and [[Union Gap, Washington|Union Gap]]; [[U.S. Route 12 in Washington|US&nbsp;12]] from Yakima to the Tri-Cities; and [[U.S. Route 395|US&nbsp;395]] from [[Kennewick, Washington|Kennewick]] and [[Umatilla, Oregon]].\n\nI-82 primarily serves the [[Yakima River|Yakima Valley]] agricultural region, following the [[Yakima River|Yakima]] and [[Columbia River|Columbia]] rivers southeastward to the Tri-Cities. The highway enters the valley from the north by crossing the [[Manastash Ridge]], which separates Yakima from the [[Kittitas Valley]]. I-82 bypasses the Tri-Cities by traveling southwest around [[Richland, Washington|Richland]] and Kennewick, turning south to cross the Columbia River on the [[Umatilla Bridge]]. Its only [[List of auxiliary Interstate Highways|auxiliary route]], [[Interstate 182|I-182]], connects the highway to Richland and [[Pasco, Washington|Pasco]] in the Tri-Cities.\n\nThe I-82 corridor was originally used by several state and national highways, including the [[Inland Empire Highway]] and [[U.S. Route 410|US&nbsp;410]], which were built in the early 20th century. The federal government created I-82 in late 1957 to serve military facilities in the region, replacing an earlier designation for what is now I-84. The first section of I-82 to be constructed was the easterly bypass of Yakima, which opened in 1963 and was gradually extended north to Ellensburg by 1971. The Yakima Valley section, connecting Union Gap to [[Prosser, Washington|Prosser]], was constructed between 1977 and 1982.\n\nThe routing of the highway between Prosser and I-84 was very controversial with residents of the Tri-Cities area, who lobbied for a longer I-82 alignment to serve them. Oregon legislators and highway officials remained opposed to a routing that bypassed Umatilla, leading to several attempts at finding a compromise along the [[Wallula Gap]] or in other areas southeast of the Tri-Cities. In 1973, Oregon and Washington adopted a federal compromise to build I-82 through Umatilla and around the outskirts of the Tri-Cities with a spur route (I-182) to serve the area directly. The Tri-Cities section opened in 1986 while in Oregon, the final section of I-82 was completed in 1988. In the early 2000s, Oregon highway officials examined plans to extend I-82 further south through [[eastern Oregon]] and towards [[California]], but rejected them from further consideration.\n\n==Route description==\n\nI-82 travels {{convert|143.6|mi|km|0}}<ref name=\"FHWA log\"/> through a part of the [[Inland Northwest (United States)|Inland Northwest]] in a generally northwest\u2013southeast direction along the [[Yakima River|Yakima]] and [[Columbia River|Columbia]] rivers.<ref name=\"WSDOT-Map\">{{cite map |year=2014 |title=Washington State Highways 2014\u20132015 |scale=1:842,000 |url=https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2006/06/13/TouristMapFront_withoutHillshade.pdf |publisher=Washington State Department of Transportation |postscript=none |accessdate=June 17, 2018}}, with [https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Publications/HighwayMap/view.htm inset maps].</ref> The four-lane divided highway forms part of the link between [[Seattle]] and the inland West, which includes [[Boise, Idaho]] and [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, Utah]].<ref>{{cite web |date=March 29, 2018 |title=Corridor Sketch Summary \u2013 I-82: Union Gap to Oregon Border (Umatilla) |url=https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2018/02/05/CSS513-i82-UnionGap-OregonBorderUmatilla.pdf |publisher=Washington State Department of Transportation |accessdate=March 20, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |date=December 1972 |title=Draft Environmental Statement: Interstate 82/182, Prosser, Washington to Interstate 80N in Oregon |page=1 |publisher=Washington State Department of Highways, Oregon State Highway Division |oclc=16701863 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=heQ0AQAAMAAJ&pg=SA1-PA1#v=onepage |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Port of Grandview: Transportation |url=http://portofgrandview.org/transportation/ |publisher=[[Port of Grandview]] |accessdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref> I-82 is a component of the [[Interstate Highway System]] and is also designated as an important national highway under the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]].<ref>{{cite web |title=National Highway System Routes \u2013 Washington State |url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/mapsdata/travel/hpms/NHSRoutes.htm |publisher=Washington State Department of Transportation |accessdate=June 17, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite map |date=March 25, 2015 |title=National Highway System: Oregon |url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/nhs_maps/oregon/or_oregon.pdf |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |accessdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref> It is also listed as a Highway of Statewide Significance by the Washington state government.<ref>{{cite web |date=July 26, 2009 |title=Transportation Commission List of Highways of Statewide Significance |url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2006/03/16/HSSlist2009mod2.pdf |publisher=[[Washington State Transportation Commission]] |accessdate=June 17, 2018}}</ref> I-82 has one [[auxiliary Interstate Highway|auxiliary route]], [[Interstate 182|I-182]], a spur route that serves the [[Tri-Cities, Washington|Tri-Cities]] region.<ref>{{cite web |date=December 31, 2017 |title=Table 2: Auxiliary Routes of the Dwight D.

An object's apparent magnitude depends on its intrinsic [[luminosity]], its distance from Earth, and any [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] of the object's light caused by [[interstellar dust]] along the line of sight to the observer.\n\nThe magnitude scale is reverse [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]]: the brighter an object is, the lower its [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]]. An object that is measured to be 5 magnitudes ''higher'' than another object is 100 times ''dimmer''. Consequently, a difference of 1.0 in magnitude corresponds to a brightness ratio of {{radic|100|5}}, or about 2.512. For example, a star of magnitude 2.0 is 2.512 times brighter than a star of magnitude 3.0 and is 100 times brighter than one of magnitude 7.0. The brightest astronomical objects have negative apparent magnitudes: for example, [[Venus]] at \u22124.2 or [[Sirius]] at \u22121.46. The faintest stars visible with the naked eye on the darkest night have apparent magnitudes of about +6.5. The apparent magnitudes of known objects range from the Sun at \u221226.7 to objects in deep [[Hubble Space Telescope]] images of around magnitude +30.<ref name=\"AAVSO\">{{cite web\n|title=Magnitudes: Measuring the Brightness of Stars\n|first=Templeton\n|last=Matthew\n|date=21 October 2011\n|publisher=American Association of Variable Stars (AAVSO)\n|url=https://www.aavso.org/magnitude\n|accessdate=19 May 2019\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190518084414/https://www.aavso.org/magnitude\n|archive-date=18 May 2019\n|url-status=live\n}}</ref>\n\nThe measurement of apparent magnitude is called\n[[Photometry (astronomy)|photometry]].

Absolute magnitude is defined as the apparent magnitude that a star or object would have if it were observed from a distance of {{convert|10|parsec|km|abbr=off|lk=in}}.

The [[List of brightest stars|brightest stars]] in the night sky were said to be of [[first magnitude star|first magnitude]] ({{mvar|m}} = 1), whereas the faintest were of sixth magnitude ({{mvar|m}} = 6), which is the limit of [[human]] [[visual perception]] (without the aid of a [[telescope]]). Each grade of magnitude was considered twice the brightness of the following grade (a [[logarithmic scale]]), although that ratio was subjective as no [[photodetector]]s existed. This rather crude scale for the brightness of stars was popularized by [[Ptolemy]] in his ''[[Almagest]]'' and is generally believed to have originated with [[Hipparchus]]. This cannot be proved or disproved because Hipparchus's original star catalogue is lost. The only preserved text by Hipparchus himself (a commetary to Aratus) clearly documents that he did not have a system to describe brightnesses with numbers: He always uses terms like \"big\" or \"small\", \"bright\" or \"faint\" or even descriptions like \"visible at fullmoon\".<ref>Hoffmann, S., Hipparchs Himmelsglobus, Springer, Wiesbaden/ New York, 2017</ref>\n\nIn 1856, [[Norman Robert Pogson]] formalized the system by defining a first magnitude star as a star that is 100 times as bright as a sixth-magnitude star, thereby establishing the logarithmic scale still in use today. This implies that a star of magnitude {{mvar|m}} is about 2.512 times as bright as a star of magnitude {{math|''m'' + 1}}. This figure, the [[Generalized continued fraction#Example 2|fifth root of 100]], became known as Pogson's Ratio.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/MNRAS/0017//0000012.000.html |title=Magnitudes of Thirty-six of the Minor Planets for the first day of each month of the year 1857 |authorlink=Norman Robert Pogson |first=N. |last=Pogson |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|MNRAS]] |volume=17 |page=12 |date=1856 |bibcode=1856MNRAS..17...12P |doi=10.1093/mnras/17.1.12 |access-date=2006-06-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703095432/http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/MNRAS/0017//0000012.000.html |archive-date=2007-07-03 |url-status=live }}</ref> The zero point of Pogson's scale was originally defined by assigning [[Polaris]] a magnitude of exactly 2. Astronomers later discovered that Polaris is slightly variable, so they switched to [[Vega]] as the standard reference star, assigning the brightness of Vega as the definition of zero magnitude at any specified wavelength.\n\nApart from small corrections, the brightness of Vega still serves as the definition of zero magnitude for visible and [[Infrared#ISO 20473 scheme|near infrared]] wavelengths, where its [[spectral energy distribution]] (SED) closely approximates that of a [[black body]] for a temperature of {{val|11000|u=K}}. However, with the advent of [[infrared astronomy]] it was revealed that Vega's radiation includes an [[infrared excess]] presumably due to a [[circumstellar disk]] consisting of [[Cosmic dust|dust]] at warm temperatures (but much cooler than the star's surface). At shorter (e.g. visible) wavelengths, there is negligible emission from dust at these temperatures. However, in order to properly extend the magnitude scale further into the infrared, this peculiarity of Vega should not affect the definition of the magnitude scale. Therefore, the magnitude scale was extrapolated to ''all'' wavelengths on the basis of the [[Planck's law|black-body radiation curve]] for an ideal stellar surface at {{val|11000|u=K}} uncontaminated by circumstellar radiation. On this basis the [[spectral irradiance]] (usually expressed in [[jansky]]s) for the zero magnitude point, as a function of wavelength, can be computed.<ref>See [https://archive.is/20121204144725/http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~patton/astro/mags.html].</ref> Small deviations are specified between systems using measurement apparatuses developed independently so that data obtained by different astronomers can be properly compared, but of greater practical importance is the definition of magnitude not at a single wavelength but applying to the response of standard spectral filters used in [[Photometry (astronomy)#methods|photometry]] over various wavelength bands.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 0.5em; text-align: center;\"\n|+ Limiting Magnitudes for Visual Observation at High Magnification<ref>{{cite book\n | title=Observing Variable Stars, Novae and Supernovae\n | first1=Gerald | last1=North | first2=Nick | last2=James\n | publisher=Cambridge University Press\n | date=2014 | isbn=9781107636125 | page=24\n | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IzoDBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA24 }}</ref>\n|-\n!Telescope<br />aperture<br />(mm)\n!Limiting<br />Magnitude\n|-\n| 35\n| 11.3\n|-\n| 60\n| 12.3\n|-\n| 102\n| 13.3\n|-\n| 152\n| 14.1\n|-\n| 203\n| 14.7\n|-\n| 305\n| 15.4\n|-\n| 406\n| 15.7\n|-\n| 508\n| 16.4\n|}\nWith the modern magnitude systems, brightness over a very wide range is specified according to the logarithmic definition detailed below, using this zero reference. In practice such apparent magnitudes do not exceed 30 (for detectable measurements). The brightness of Vega is exceeded by four stars in the night sky at visible wavelengths (and more at infrared wavelengths) as well as the bright planets Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, and these must be described by ''negative'' magnitudes. For example, [[Sirius]], the brightest star of the [[celestial sphere]], has a magnitude of \u22121.4 in the visible. Negative magnitudes for other very bright astronomical objects can be found in the [[#Table of notable celestial objects|table]] below.\n\nAstronomers have developed other photometric zeropoint systems as alternatives to the Vega system. The most widely used is the [[AB magnitude]] system,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Oke|first1=J. B.|last2=Gunn|first2=J. E.|title=Secondary standard stars for absolute spectrophotometry|journal=The Astrophysical Journal |date=15 March 1983 |volume=266|pages=713\u2013717|doi=10.1086/160817|bibcode=1983ApJ...266..713O}}</ref> in which photometric zeropoints are based on a hypothetical reference spectrum having constant [[Spectral flux density|flux per unit frequency interval]], rather than using a stellar spectrum or blackbody curve as the reference. The AB magnitude zeropoint is defined such that an object's AB and Vega-based magnitudes will be approximately equal in the V filter band.\n\n== Measurement ==\n{{main|Photometry (astronomy)}}\nPrecision measurement of magnitude (photometry) requires calibration of the photographic or (usually) electronic [[photodetector|detection]] apparatus. This generally involves contemporaneous observation, under identical conditions, of standard stars whose magnitude using that spectral filter is accurately known. Moreover, as the amount of light actually received by a telescope is reduced due to transmission through the [[Earth's atmosphere]], the [[airmass]]es of the target and calibration stars must be taken into account. Typically one would observe a few different stars of known magnitude which are sufficiently similar. Calibrator stars close in the sky to the target are favoured (to avoid large differences in the atmospheric paths). If those stars have somewhat different [[zenith angle]]s ([[Horizontal coordinate system#Definition|altitude]]s) then a correction factor as a function of [[airmass]] can be derived and [[Photometry (astronomy)#Calibrations|applied]] to the airmass at the target's position. Such calibration obtains the brightnesses as would be observed from above the atmosphere, where apparent magnitude is defined.\n\n== Calculations ==\n[[File:VISTA Magellanic Cloud Survey view of the Tarantula Nebula.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Image of [[30 Doradus]] taken by [[ESO]]'s [[VISTA (telescope)|VISTA]]. This [[nebula]] has a visual magnitude of 8.]]\n[[File:Apparent magnitude.svg|thumb|Graph of relative brightness versus magnitude]]\n\nThe dimmer an object appears, the higher the numerical value given to its magnitude, with a difference of 5 magnitudes corresponding to a brightness factor of exactly 100. Therefore, the magnitude {{mvar|m}}, in the [[Photometric system|spectral band]] {{mvar|x}}, would be given by\n\n:<math>m_{x}= -5 \\log_{100} \\left(\\frac {F_x}{F_{x,0}}\\right),</math>\n\nwhich is more commonly expressed in terms of [[Common logarithm|common (base-10) logarithms]] as\n\n:<math>m_{x} = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left(\\frac {F_x}{F_{x,0}}\\right),</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|F<sub>x</sub>}} is the observed [[flux density]] using spectral filter {{mvar|x}}, and {{math|''F''<sub>''x'',0</sub>}} is the reference flux (zero-point) for that [[Photometric system#Filters used|photometric filter]]. Since an increase of 5 magnitudes corresponds to a decrease in brightness by a factor of exactly 100, each magnitude increase implies a decrease in brightness by the factor {{radic|100|5}} \u2248&nbsp;2.512 (Pogson's ratio). Inverting the above formula, a magnitude difference {{math|''m''<sub>1</sub> \u2212 ''m''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} \u0394''m''}} implies a brightness factor of\n\n:<math> \\frac{F_2}{F_1} = 100^\\frac{\\Delta m}{5} = 10^{0.4 \\Delta m} \\approx 2.512^{\\Delta m}.</math>\n\n=== Example: Sun and Moon ===\n''What is the ratio in brightness between the [[Sun]] and the full [[Moon]]?''\n\nThe apparent magnitude of the Sun is \u221226.74 (brighter), and the mean magnitude of the [[full moon]] is \u221212.74 (dimmer).\n\nDifference in magnitude: \n:<math> x = m_1 - m_2 = (-12.74) - (-26.74) = 14.00. </math>\n\nBrightness factor: \n:<math> v_b = 10^{0.4 x} = 10^{0.4 \\times 14.00} \\approx 398\\,107. </math>\n\nThe Sun appears about {{val|400000}} times brighter than the full moon.\n\n===Magnitude addition===\nSometimes one might wish to add brightnesses. For example, [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] on closely separated [[double star]]s may only be able to produce a measurement of their combined light output. How would we reckon the combined magnitude of that double star knowing only the magnitudes of the individual components? This can be done by adding the brightnesses (in linear units) corresponding to each magnitude.<ref>{{cite web|title=Magnitude Arithmetic|url=http://www.caglow.com/info/wtopic/mag-arith|work=Weekly Topic|publisher=Caglow|accessdate=30 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201203951/http://www.caglow.com/info/wtopic/mag-arith|archive-date=1 February 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n:<math> 10^{-m_f \\times 0.4} = 10^{-m_1 \\times 0.4} + 10^{-m_2 \\times 0.4}. </math>\n\nSolving for <math>m_f</math> yields\n:<math> m_f = -2.5\\log_{10} \\left(10^{-m_1 \\times 0.4} + 10^{-m_2 \\times 0.4} \\right), </math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|m<sub>f</sub>}} is the resulting magnitude after adding the brightnesses referred to by {{math|''m''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''m''<sub>2</sub>}}.\n\n===Apparent bolometric magnitude===\nWhile magnitude generally refers to a measurement in a particular filter band corresponding to some range of wavelengths, the apparent or absolute '''bolometric magnitude''' (m<sub>bol</sub>) is a measure of an object's apparent or absolute brightness integrated over all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum (also known as the object's [[irradiance]] or power, respectively).

Flux decreases with distance according to an [[inverse-square law]], so the apparent magnitude of a star depends on both its absolute brightness and its distance (and any extinction). For example, a star at one distance will have the same apparent magnitude as a star four times brighter at twice that distance.  In contrast, the intrinsic brightness of an astronomical object, does not depend on the distance of the observer or any [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]].\n\nThe absolute magnitude {{mvar|M}}, of a star or astronomical object is defined as the apparent magnitude it would have as seen from a distance of {{convert|10|pc|ly|lk=out}}. The absolute magnitude of the Sun is 4.83 in the V band (green) and 5.48 in the B band (blue).<ref name=\"Bband\">{{cite web\n |title=Some Useful Astronomical Definitions\n |publisher=Stony Brook Astronomy Program\n |first=Aaron\n |last=Evans\n |url=http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/aevans/PHY523/classnotes523/useful-definitions-pp.pdf\n |accessdate=2009-07-12\n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720052227/http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/aevans/PHY523/classnotes523/useful-definitions-pp.pdf\n |archive-date=2011-07-20\n |url-status=live\n }}</ref>\n\nIn the case of a planet or asteroid, the absolute magnitude {{mvar|H}} rather means the apparent magnitude it would have if it were {{convert|1|AU|km|lk=in}} from both the observer and the Sun, and fully illuminated (a configuration that is only theoretically achievable, with the observer situated on the surface of the Sun).{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n== Standard reference values ==\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Standard apparent magnitudes and fluxes for typical bands<ref name=\"UTmags\">{{cite web\n |title=Astronomical Magnitude Systems\n |publisher=Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics\n |first=John\n |last=Huchra\n |url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~dfabricant/huchra/ay145/mags.html\n |accessdate=2017-07-18\n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721162252/https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~dfabricant/huchra/ay145/mags.html\n |archive-date=2018-07-21\n |url-status=live\n }}</ref>\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Band\n! rowspan=\"2\" | {{mvar|\u03bb}}<br />(\u03bcm)\n! rowspan=\"2\" | {{math|{{sfrac|\u0394''\u03bb''|''\u03bb''}}}}<br />([[full width at half maximum|FWHM]])\n! colspan=\"2\" | Flux at {{math|''m'' {{=}} 0}}, {{math|''F''<sub>''x'',0</sub>}}\n\n|-\n!

A common misconception is that the logarithmic nature of the scale is because the [[human eye]] itself has a logarithmic response. In Pogson's time this was thought to be true (see [[Weber\u2013Fechner law]]), but it is now believed that the response is a [[power law]] (see [[Stevens' power law]]).<ref>{{cite journal|title=Misconceptions About Astronomical Magnitudes|authorlink=Eric Schulman|first1=E.|last1=Schulman|first2=C.

The sensitivity of a light detector varies according to the wavelength of the light, and the way it varies depends on the type of light detector. For this reason, it is necessary to specify how the magnitude is measured for the value to be meaningful. For this purpose the [[UBV system]] is widely used, in which the magnitude is measured in three different wavelength bands: U (centred at about 350&nbsp;nm, in the near [[ultraviolet]]), B (about 435&nbsp;nm, in the blue region) and V (about 555&nbsp;nm, in the middle of the human visual range in daylight). The V band was chosen for spectral purposes and gives magnitudes closely corresponding to those seen by the human eye. When an apparent magnitude is discussed without further qualification, the V magnitude is generally understood.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nBecause cooler stars, such as [[red giant]]s and [[red dwarf]]s, emit little energy in the blue and UV regions of the spectrum, their power is often under-represented by the UBV scale. Indeed, some [[stellar classification|L and T class]] stars have an estimated magnitude of well over 100, because they emit extremely little visible light, but are strongest in [[infrared]].{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nMeasures of magnitude need cautious treatment and it is extremely important to measure like with like. On early 20th century and older orthochromatic (blue-sensitive) [[photographic film]], the relative brightnesses of the blue [[supergiant]] [[Rigel]] and the red supergiant [[Betelgeuse]] irregular variable star (at maximum) are reversed compared to what human eyes perceive, because this archaic film is more sensitive to blue light than it is to red light. Magnitudes obtained from this method are known as [[photographic magnitude]]s, and are now considered obsolete.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nFor objects within the [[Milky Way]] with a given absolute magnitude, 5 is added to the apparent magnitude for every tenfold increase in the distance to the object. For objects at very great distances (far beyond the Milky Way), this relationship must be [[K correction|adjusted for redshifts]] and for [[Non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]] distance measures due to [[general relativity]].<ref name=umeh>{{cite journal|bibcode=2014CQGra..31t5001U|arxiv=1402.1933|title=Nonlinear relativistic corrections to cosmological distances, redshift and gravitational lensing magnification: II.

An object's apparent magnitude depends on its intrinsic [[luminosity]], its distance from Earth, and any [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] of the object's light caused by [[interstellar dust]] along the line of sight to the observer.\n\nThe magnitude scale is reverse [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]]: the brighter an object is, the lower its [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]]. An object that is measured to be 5 magnitudes ''higher'' than another object is 100 times ''dimmer''. Consequently, a difference of 1.0 in magnitude corresponds to a brightness ratio of {{radic|100|5}}, or about 2.512. For example, a star of magnitude 2.0 is 2.512 times brighter than a star of magnitude 3.0 and is 100 times brighter than one of magnitude 7.0. The brightest astronomical objects have negative apparent magnitudes: for example, [[Venus]] at \u22124.2 or [[Sirius]] at \u22121.46. The faintest stars visible with the naked eye on the darkest night have apparent magnitudes of about +6.5. The apparent magnitudes of known objects range from the Sun at \u221226.7 to objects in deep [[Hubble Space Telescope]] images of around magnitude +30.<ref name=\"AAVSO\">{{cite web\n|title=Magnitudes: Measuring the Brightness of Stars\n|first=Templeton\n|last=Matthew\n|date=21 October 2011\n|publisher=American Association of Variable Stars (AAVSO)\n|url=https://www.aavso.org/magnitude\n|accessdate=19 May 2019\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190518084414/https://www.aavso.org/magnitude\n|archive-date=18 May 2019\n|url-status=live\n}}</ref>\n\nThe measurement of apparent magnitude is called\n[[Photometry (astronomy)|photometry]].

The [[List of brightest stars|brightest stars]] in the night sky were said to be of [[first magnitude star|first magnitude]] ({{mvar|m}} = 1), whereas the faintest were of sixth magnitude ({{mvar|m}} = 6), which is the limit of [[human]] [[visual perception]] (without the aid of a [[telescope]]). Each grade of magnitude was considered twice the brightness of the following grade (a [[logarithmic scale]]), although that ratio was subjective as no [[photodetector]]s existed. This rather crude scale for the brightness of stars was popularized by [[Ptolemy]] in his ''[[Almagest]]'' and is generally believed to have originated with [[Hipparchus]]. This cannot be proved or disproved because Hipparchus's original star catalogue is lost. The only preserved text by Hipparchus himself (a commetary to Aratus) clearly documents that he did not have a system to describe brightnesses with numbers: He always uses terms like \"big\" or \"small\", \"bright\" or \"faint\" or even descriptions like \"visible at fullmoon\".<ref> Hoffmann, S., Hipparchs Himmelsglobus, Springer, Wiesbaden/ New York, 2017</ref> \n\nIn 1856, [[Norman Robert Pogson]] formalized the system by defining a first magnitude star as a star that is 100 times as bright as a sixth-magnitude star, thereby establishing the logarithmic scale still in use today. This implies that a star of magnitude {{mvar|m}} is about 2.512 times as bright as a star of magnitude {{math|''m'' + 1}}. This figure, the [[Generalized continued fraction#Example 2|fifth root of 100]], became known as Pogson's Ratio.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/MNRAS/0017//0000012.000.html |title=Magnitudes of Thirty-six of the Minor Planets for the first day of each month of the year 1857 |authorlink=Norman Robert Pogson |first=N. |last=Pogson |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|MNRAS]] |volume=17 |page=12 |date=1856 |bibcode=1856MNRAS..17...12P |doi=10.1093/mnras/17.1.12 |access-date=2006-06-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703095432/http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/MNRAS/0017//0000012.000.html |archive-date=2007-07-03 |url-status=live }}</ref> The zero point of Pogson's scale was originally defined by assigning [[Polaris]] a magnitude of exactly 2. Astronomers later discovered that Polaris is slightly variable, so they switched to [[Vega]] as the standard reference star, assigning the brightness of Vega as the definition of zero magnitude at any specified wavelength.\n\nApart from small corrections, the brightness of Vega still serves as the definition of zero magnitude for visible and [[Infrared#ISO 20473 scheme|near infrared]] wavelengths, where its [[spectral energy distribution]] (SED) closely approximates that of a [[black body]] for a temperature of {{val|11000|u=K}}. However, with the advent of [[infrared astronomy]] it was revealed that Vega's radiation includes an [[infrared excess]] presumably due to a [[circumstellar disk]] consisting of [[Cosmic dust|dust]] at warm temperatures (but much cooler than the star's surface). At shorter (e.g. visible) wavelengths, there is negligible emission from dust at these temperatures. However, in order to properly extend the magnitude scale further into the infrared, this peculiarity of Vega should not affect the definition of the magnitude scale. Therefore, the magnitude scale was extrapolated to ''all'' wavelengths on the basis of the [[Planck's law|black-body radiation curve]] for an ideal stellar surface at {{val|11000|u=K}} uncontaminated by circumstellar radiation. On this basis the [[spectral irradiance]] (usually expressed in [[jansky]]s) for the zero magnitude point, as a function of wavelength, can be computed.<ref>See [https://archive.is/20121204144725/http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/~patton/astro/mags.html].</ref> Small deviations are specified between systems using measurement apparatuses developed independently so that data obtained by different astronomers can be properly compared, but of greater practical importance is the definition of magnitude not at a single wavelength but applying to the response of standard spectral filters used in [[Photometry (astronomy)#methods|photometry]] over various wavelength bands.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 0.5em; text-align: center;\"\n|+ Limiting Magnitudes for Visual Observation at High Magnification<ref>{{cite book\n | title=Observing Variable Stars, Novae and Supernovae\n | first1=Gerald | last1=North | first2=Nick | last2=James\n | publisher=Cambridge University Press\n | date=2014 | isbn=9781107636125 | page=24\n | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IzoDBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA24 }}</ref>\n|-\n!Telescope<br>aperture<br>(mm)\n!Limiting<br>Magnitude\n|-\n| 35\n| 11.3\n|-\n| 60\n| 12.3\n|-\n| 102\n| 13.3\n|-\n| 152\n| 14.1\n|-\n| 203\n| 14.7\n|-\n| 305\n| 15.4\n|-\n| 406\n| 15.7\n|-\n| 508\n| 16.4\n|}\nWith the modern magnitude systems, brightness over a very wide range is specified according to the logarithmic definition detailed below, using this zero reference. In practice such apparent magnitudes do not exceed 30 (for detectable measurements). The brightness of Vega is exceeded by four stars in the night sky at visible wavelengths (and more at infrared wavelengths) as well as the bright planets Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, and these must be described by ''negative'' magnitudes. For example, [[Sirius]], the brightest star of the [[celestial sphere]], has a magnitude of \u22121.4 in the visible. Negative magnitudes for other very bright astronomical objects can be found in the [[#Table of notable celestial objects|table]] below.\n\nAstronomers have developed other photometric zeropoint systems as alternatives to the Vega system. The most widely used is the [[AB magnitude]] system,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Oke|first1=J. B.|last2=Gunn|first2=J. E.|title=Secondary standard stars for absolute spectrophotometry|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=March 15, 1983|volume=266|pages=713\u2013717|doi=10.1086/160817|bibcode=1983ApJ...266..713O}}</ref> in which photometric zeropoints are based on a hypothetical reference spectrum having constant [[Spectral flux density|flux per unit frequency interval]], rather than using a stellar spectrum or blackbody curve as the reference. The AB magnitude zeropoint is defined such that an object's AB and Vega-based magnitudes will be approximately equal in the V filter band.\n\n== Measurement ==\n{{main|Photometry (astronomy)}}\nPrecision measurement of magnitude (photometry) requires calibration of the photographic or (usually) electronic [[photodetector|detection]] apparatus. This generally involves contemporaneous observation, under identical conditions, of standard stars whose magnitude using that spectral filter is accurately known. Moreover, as the amount of light actually received by a telescope is reduced due to transmission through the [[Earth's atmosphere]], the [[airmass]]es of the target and calibration stars must be taken into account. Typically one would observe a few different stars of known magnitude which are sufficiently similar. Calibrator stars close in the sky to the target are favoured (to avoid large differences in the atmospheric paths). If those stars have somewhat different [[zenith angle]]s ([[Horizontal coordinate system#Definition|altitude]]s) then a correction factor as a function of [[airmass]] can be derived and [[Photometry (astronomy)#Calibrations|applied]] to the airmass at the target's position. Such calibration obtains the brightnesses as would be observed from above the atmosphere, where apparent magnitude is defined.\n\n== Calculations ==\n[[File:VISTA Magellanic Cloud Survey view of the Tarantula Nebula.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Image of [[30 Doradus]] taken by [[ESO]]'s [[VISTA (telescope)|VISTA]]. This [[nebula]] has a visual magnitude of 8.]]\n[[File:Apparent magnitude.svg|thumb|Graph of relative brightness versus magnitude]]\n\nThe dimmer an object appears, the higher the numerical value given to its magnitude, with a difference of 5 magnitudes corresponding to a brightness factor of exactly 100. Therefore, the magnitude {{mvar|m}}, in the [[Photometric system|spectral band]] {{mvar|x}}, would be given by\n\n:<math>m_{x}= -5 \\log_{100} \\left(\\frac {F_x}{F_{x,0}}\\right),</math>\n\nwhich is more commonly expressed in terms of [[Common logarithm|common (base-10) logarithms]] as\n\n:<math>m_{x} = -2.5 \\log_{10} \\left(\\frac {F_x}{F_{x,0}}\\right),</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|F<sub>x</sub>}} is the observed [[flux density]] using spectral filter {{mvar|x}}, and {{math|''F''<sub>''x'',0</sub>}} is the reference flux (zero-point) for that [[Photometric system#Filters used|photometric filter]]. Since an increase of 5 magnitudes corresponds to a decrease in brightness by a factor of exactly 100, each magnitude increase implies a decrease in brightness by the factor {{radic|100|5}} \u2248&nbsp;2.512 (Pogson's ratio). Inverting the above formula, a magnitude difference {{math|''m''<sub>1</sub> \u2212 ''m''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} \u0394''m''}} implies a brightness factor of\n\n:<math> \\frac{F_2}{F_1} = 100^\\frac{\\Delta m}{5} = 10^{0.4 \\Delta m} \\approx 2.512^{\\Delta m}.</math>\n\n=== Example: Sun and Moon ===\n''What is the ratio in brightness between the [[Sun]] and the full [[Moon]]?''\n\nThe apparent magnitude of the Sun is \u221226.74 (brighter), and the mean magnitude of the [[full moon]] is \u221212.74 (dimmer).\n\nDifference in magnitude: \n:<math> x = m_1 - m_2 = (-12.74) - (-26.74) = 14.00. </math>\n\nBrightness factor: \n:<math> v_b = 10^{0.4 x} = 10^{0.4 \\times 14.00} \\approx 398\\,107. </math>\n\nThe Sun appears about {{val|400000}} times brighter than the full moon.\n\n===Magnitude addition===\nSometimes one might wish to add brightnesses. For example, [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] on closely separated [[double star]]s may only be able to produce a measurement of their combined light output. How would we reckon the combined magnitude of that double star knowing only the magnitudes of the individual components? This can be done by adding the brightnesses (in linear units) corresponding to each magnitude.<ref>{{cite web|title=Magnitude Arithmetic|url=http://www.caglow.com/info/wtopic/mag-arith|work=Weekly Topic|publisher=Caglow|accessdate=30 January 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201203951/http://www.caglow.com/info/wtopic/mag-arith|archive-date=1 February 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n:<math> 10^{-m_f \\times 0.4} = 10^{-m_1 \\times 0.4} + 10^{-m_2 \\times 0.4}. </math>\n\nSolving for <math>m_f</math> yields\n:<math> m_f = -2.5\\log_{10} \\left(10^{-m_1 \\times 0.4} + 10^{-m_2 \\times 0.4} \\right), </math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|m<sub>f</sub>}} is the resulting magnitude after adding the brightnesses referred to by {{math|''m''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''m''<sub>2</sub>}}.\n\n===Apparent bolometric magnitude===\nWhile magnitude generally refers to a measurement in a particular filter band corresponding to some range of wavelengths, the apparent or absolute '''bolometric magnitude''' (m<sub>bol</sub>) is a measure of an object's apparent or absolute brightness integrated over all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum (also known as the object's [[irradiance]] or power, respectively).

Flux decreases with distance according to an [[inverse-square law]], so the apparent magnitude of a star depends on both its absolute brightness and its distance (and any extinction). For example, a star at one distance will have the same apparent magnitude as a star four times brighter at twice that distance.  In contrast, the intrinsic brightness of an astronomical object, does not depend on the distance of the observer or any [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]].\n\nThe absolute magnitude {{mvar|M}}, of a star or astronomical object is defined as the apparent magnitude it would have as seen from a distance of {{convert|10|pc|ly|lk=out}}.

A common misconception is that the logarithmic nature of the scale is because the [[human eye]] itself has a logarithmic response. In Pogson's time this was thought to be true (see [[Weber\u2013Fechner law]]), but it is now believed that the response is a [[power law]] (see [[Stevens' power law]]).<ref>{{cite journal|title=Misconceptions About Astronomical Magnitudes|authorlink=Eric Schulman|first1=E.|last1=Schulman|first2=C. V.|last2=Cox|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=65|issue=10|page=1003|date=1997|bibcode = 1997AmJPh..65.1003S |doi = 10.1119/1.18714 }}</ref>\n\nMagnitude is complicated by the fact that light is not [[monochromatic]]. The sensitivity of a light detector varies according to the wavelength of the light, and the way it varies depends on the type of light detector. For this reason, it is necessary to specify how the magnitude is measured for the value to be meaningful. For this purpose the [[UBV system]] is widely used, in which the magnitude is measured in three different wavelength bands: U (centred at about 350&nbsp;nm, in the near [[ultraviolet]]), B (about 435&nbsp;nm, in the blue region) and V (about 555&nbsp;nm, in the middle of the human visual range in daylight). The V band was chosen for spectral purposes and gives magnitudes closely corresponding to those seen by the human eye. When an apparent magnitude is discussed without further qualification, the V magnitude is generally understood.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nBecause cooler stars, such as [[red giant]]s and [[red dwarf]]s, emit little energy in the blue and UV regions of the spectrum, their power is often under-represented by the UBV scale. Indeed, some [[stellar classification|L and T class]] stars have an estimated magnitude of well over 100, because they emit extremely little visible light, but are strongest in [[infrared]].{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nMeasures of magnitude need cautious treatment and it is extremely important to measure like with like. On early 20th century and older orthochromatic (blue-sensitive) [[photographic film]], the relative brightnesses of the blue [[supergiant]] [[Rigel]] and the red supergiant [[Betelgeuse]] irregular variable star (at maximum) are reversed compared to what human eyes perceive, because this archaic film is more sensitive to blue light than it is to red light. Magnitudes obtained from this method are known as [[photographic magnitude]]s, and are now considered obsolete.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nFor objects within the [[Milky Way]] with a given absolute magnitude, 5 is added to the apparent magnitude for every tenfold increase in the distance to the object. For objects at very great distances (far beyond the Milky Way), this relationship must be [[K correction|adjusted for redshifts]] and for [[Non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]] distance measures due to [[general relativity]].<ref name=umeh>{{cite journal|bibcode=2014CQGra..31t5001U|arxiv=1402.1933|title=Nonlinear relativistic corrections to cosmological distances, redshift and gravitational lensing magnification: II.
