In most [[U.S. state]]s outside [[New Hampshire]], votes for [[write-in candidate]]s remain untallied.\n\n[[Primary election]]s and [[caucus]]es can be binding or nonbinding in allocating [[Delegate (American politics)|delegates]] to the respective state delegations to the [[Republican National Convention]]. But the actual election of the delegates can be at a later date. Delegates are (1) elected at conventions, (2) from [[Slate (elections)|slates]] submitted by the candidates, (3) selected by the party's state chairman or (4) at committee meetings or (5) elected directly at the party's caucuses and primaries. Until the delegates are actually apportioned, the delegate numbers are by nature projections, but it is only in the states with nonbinding caucuses where they are not allocated at the primary or caucus date.\n\nSeveral states have decided to cancel their primaries and caucuses.<ref name=\"apsept7\">{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/7e04964fc89a4312a6b410096f256add|title=Nevada, SC, Kansas GOP drop presidential nomination votes|first=Meg|last=Kinnard|date=September 7, 2019|website=AP NEWS}}</ref> They cite the fact that Republicans canceled several state primaries when [[George H.W.

Released in 1987, it was Yoakam's second consecutive #1 album on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] Country Albums chart. Four tracks were released as singles with each becoming Top 10 hits on the [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] chart in 1987 and 1988.\n\n==Background==\nWith the success of his debut album ''Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.'', which hit #1 on the ''Billboard'' country albums chart, Yoakam emerged as one of country music\u2019s hottest stars.  Aided by producer and guitarist [[Pete Anderson]], he put a fresh spin on the honky-tonk sound of his Bakersfield hero [[Buck Owens]] to create a unique style that revitalized interest in traditional country music, as opposed to the more pop-friendly approach that dominated [[Nashville]] in the early and mid-Eighties.  Yoakam developed his sound in the bars and punk rock clubs of [[Los Angeles]] and released a six-song EP that would eventually get him signed to [[Reprise]].  However, as his star rose, Yoakam did not mince words in interviews when asked about the music industry in Nashville - such as his disdain for executives at [[Columbia Records]] after they dropped [[Johnny Cash]] from the label, among other things - and quickly gained a reputation as an opinionated outsider.  Yoakam was largely unimpressed by when he first visited [[Music City]] earlier in the decade and touted the open-minded creativity of the west coast scene. Critics responded by questioning the [[Kentucky]]-born songwriter\u2019s hillbilly credentials, and his refusal to play ball with Nashville likely cost him radio play and award nominations from the powerful [[Country Music Association]], although he was immensely popular with the Los Angeles-based [[Academy of Country Music]].  As one writer put it, \u201cRemaining in Los Angeles distanced Yoakam from the Nashville music industry to advance his recording career through radio play, but it allowed him to develop as a live performer, to work the circuit, sharpen his chops, find his audience, and forge his own path.\u201d{{sfn|McLeese, Don|2012|p=47}}\n\n==Recording & Composition==\n''Hillbilly Deluxe'' appeared in April 1987, a mere thirteen months after his debut LP.  Producer Pete Anderson later recalled:\n\n{{quote|When we started, Dwight had twenty-one songs that were really good, that we played on the bandstand.  So I said to him, \u201cLet\u2019s do seven of your songs and three covers on every album.  So right now you\u2019ve got three albums\u2019 worth of material.\u201d  So he had \u201cSouth of Cincinnati,\u201d \u201c[[I Sang Dixie]],\u201d and \u201cJohnson\u2019s Love\u201d that were all slow tempo tunes.  It wasn\u2019t that any of them was basically better, but we couldn\u2019t put all three on the same record.{{sfn|McLeese, Don|2012|p=92}}}} \n\nThe result was a second album of remarkable high quality, with [[AllMusic]] noting, \u201c''Hillbilly Deluxe'' is proof that beyond a shadow of a doubt, Dwight Yoakam's ''Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.'' was no fluke. There's no sophomore slump here\u2026In fact, it can be heard and viewed as Yoakam and producer/guitarist Pete Anderson cementing the commitment to [[Bakersfield]]-styled honky tonk music.\u201d  The album opens with the newly-written \u201c[[Little Ways]],\u201d which peaked at #8 on the country singles chart.  (It topped the country charts in [[Canada]].)  In the \u201cBeyond Nashville\u201d episode of the 2003 documentary ''Lost Highway'', Yoakam admits the elongated opening vocal was an approximation of Buck Owens trademark singing style on songs like \u201cI\u2019ve Got a Tiger By the Tail.\u201d  \u201cLittle Ways\" is distinctly an homage to Buck, a signature combination of the drawn-out phrasing and hard-twang guitar that had distinguished so many of his hits.{{sfn|McLeese, Don|2012|p=95}} (In the liner notes of the LP, Yoakam wrote: \u201cVERY SPECIAL THANKS: to Buck Owens for all his records that still serve as an inspiration for the [[California]] honky-tonk sound.\u201d)  Additional musical influences can be found in the cover songs Yoakam chose to record for the album, including [[Stonewall Jackson]]\u2019s 1959 hit \u201cSmoke Along the Tracks,\u201d a radical reworking of [[Lefty Frizzell]]\u2019s \u201c[[Always Late with Your Kisses]],\u201d and [[Elvis Presley]]\u2019s 1961 song \u201c[[Little Sister (Elvis Presley song)|Little Sister]],\u201d which would be the album\u2019s first single and biggest hit, peaking at #7.  \n\nAs on his debut LP, ''Hillbilly Deluxe'' contains seven original songs that display a depth and maturity on par with any country music songwriter at the time, especially the ballads \u201cJohnson\u2019s Love\u201d and \u201c1,000 Miles.\u201d  Clocking in at nearly four-and-a-half minutes, the former tells the mournful story of a man named Johnson who pines for his lost love Maureen, calling her name \u201cdeep in the night or sometimes right at dawn.\u201d  In his book ''A Thousand Miles from Nowhere'', biographer Don McLeese states the song is steeped in the Kentucky memories of Yoakam's coal-mining grandfather Luther Tibbs, and quotes the singer, \u201cMy grandfather is the central character in \u2018Johnson\u2019s Love,\u2019 but not him literally.  It\u2019s just the tool that allows the writer to move beyond himself to something larger than himself. That\u2019s the task at hand.  And that\u2019s what the best writing can be, using what you know to move beyond yourself.\u201d{{sfn|McLeese, Don|2012|p=94}} McLeese contends the song \u201csounds like Yoakam\u2019s version of [[George Jones]]\u2019s classic \u2018[[He Stopped Loving Her Today]].\u2019\u201d{{sfn|McLeese, Don|2012|p=94}}  However, the main character in that song is finally set free from his heartbreak by his own death, but In \u201cJohnson\u2019s Love\u201d there is no such deliverance, with the narrator observing:\n\n:''I heard the preacher at the service\n:''Say from love he\u2019s finally free\n:''But I say love it knows no season\n:''It haunts the soul eternally\n\nAnderson\u2019s production on the ballad is irretrievably country, as it is on the foreboding \u201c1,000 Miles,\u201d which finds a man boarding \u201cflight 209\u201d and ruminating on his broken marriage.

Released in 1987, it was Yoakam's second consecutive #1 album on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] Country Albums chart. Four tracks were released as singles with each becoming Top 10 hits on the [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] chart in 1987 and 1988.\n\n==Background==\nWith the success of his debut album ''Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.'', which hit #1 on the ''Billboard'' country albums chart, Yoakam emerged as one of country music\u2019s hottest stars.  Aided by producer and guitarist [[Pete Anderson]], he put a fresh spin on the honky-tonk sound of his Bakersfield hero [[Buck Owens]] to create a unique style that revitalized interest in traditional country music, as opposed to the more pop-friendly approach that dominated [[Nashville]] in the early and mid-Eighties.  Yoakam developed his sound in the bars and punk rock clubs of [[Los Angeles]] and released a six-song EP that would eventually get him signed to [[Reprise]].  However, as his star rose, Yoakam did not mince words in interviews when asked about the music industry in Nashville - such as his disdain for executives at [[Columbia Records]] after they dropped [[Johnny Cash]] from the label, among other things - and quickly gained a reputation as an opinionated outsider.  Yoakam was largely unimpressed by when he first visited [[Music City]] earlier in the decade and touted the open-minded creativity of the west coast scene. Critics responded by questioning the [[Kentucky]]-born songwriter\u2019s hillbilly credentials, and his refusal to play ball with Nashville likely cost him radio play and award nominations from the powerful [[Country Music Association]], although he was immensely popular with the Los Angeles-based [[Academy of Country Music]].  As one writer put it, \u201cRemaining in Los Angeles distanced Yoakam from the Nashville music industry to advance his recording career through radio play, but it allowed him to develop as a live performer, to work the circuit, sharpen his chops, find his audience, and forge his own path.\u201d{{sfn|McLeese, Don|2012|p=47}}\n\n==Recording & Composition==\n''Hillbilly Deluxe'' appeared in April 1987, a mere thirteen months after his debut LP.  Producer Pete Anderson later recalled:\n\n{{quote|When we started, Dwight had twenty-one songs that were really good, that we played on the bandstand.  So I said to him, \u201cLet\u2019s do seven of your songs and three covers on every album.  So right now you\u2019ve got three albums\u2019 worth of material.\u201d  So he had \u201cSouth of Cincinnati,\u201d \u201c[[I Sang Dixie]],\u201d and \u201cJohnson\u2019s Love\u201d that were all slow tempo tunes.  It wasn\u2019t that any of them was basically better, but we couldn\u2019t put all three on the same record.{{sfn|McLeese, Don|2012|p=92}}}} \n\nThe result was a second album of remarkable high quality, with [[AllMusic]] noting, \u201c''Hillbilly Deluxe'' is proof that beyond a shadow of a doubt, Dwight Yoakam's ''Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.'' was no fluke. There's no sophomore slump here\u2026In fact, it can be heard and viewed as Yoakam and producer/guitarist Pete Anderson cementing the commitment to [[Bakersfield]]-styled honky tonk music.\u201d  The album opens with the newly-written \u201c[[Little Ways]],\u201d which peaked at #8 on the country singles chart.  (It topped the country charts in [[Canada]].)  In the \u201cBeyond Nashville\u201d episode of the 2003 documentary ''Lost Highway'', Yoakam admits the elongated opening vocal was an approximation of Buck Owens trademark singing style on songs like \u201cI\u2019ve Got a Tiger By the Tail.\u201d  \u201cLittle Ways\" is distinctly an homage to Buck, a signature combination of the drawn-out phrasing and hard-twang guitar that had distinguished so many of his hits.{{sfn|McLeese, Don|2012|p=95}} (In the liner notes of the LP, Yoakam wrote: \u201cVERY SPECIAL THANKS: to Buck Owens for all his records that still serve as an inspiration for the [[California]] honky-tonk sound.\u201d)  Additional musical influences can be found in the cover songs Yoakam chose to record for the album, including [[Stonewall Jackson]]\u2019s 1959 hit \u201cSmoke Along the Tracks,\u201d a radical reworking of [[Lefty Frizzell]]\u2019s \u201c[[Always Late with Your Kisses]],\u201d and [[Elvis Presley]]\u2019s 1961 song \u201c[[Little Sister]],\u201d which would be the album\u2019s first single and biggest hit, peaking at #7.  \n\nAs on his debut LP, ''Hillbilly Deluxe'' contains seven original songs that display a depth and maturity on par with any country music songwriter at the time, especially the ballads \u201cJohnson\u2019s Love\u201d and \u201c1,000 Miles.\u201d  Clocking in at nearly four-and-a-half minutes, the former tells the mournful story of a man named Johnson who pines for his lost love Maureen, calling her name \u201cdeep in the night or sometimes right at dawn.\u201d  In his book ''A Thousand Miles from Nowhere'', biographer Don McLeese states the song is steeped in the Kentucky memories of Yoakam's coal-mining grandfather Luther Tibbs, and quotes the singer, \u201cMy grandfather is the central character in \u2018Johnson\u2019s Love,\u2019 but not him literally.  It\u2019s just the tool that allows the writer to move beyond himself to something larger than himself. That\u2019s the task at hand.  And that\u2019s what the best writing can be, using what you know to move beyond yourself.\u201d{{sfn|McLeese, Don|2012|p=94}} McLeese contends the song \u201csounds like Yoakam\u2019s version of [[George Jones]]\u2019s classic \u2018[[He Stopped Loving Her Today]].\u2019\u201d{{sfn|McLeese, Don|2012|p=94}}  However, the main character in that song is finally set free from his heartbreak by his own death, but In \u201cJohnson\u2019s Love\u201d there is no such deliverance, with the narrator observing:\n\n:''I heard the preacher at the service\n:''Say from love he\u2019s finally free\n:''But I say love it knows no season\n:''It haunts the soul eternally\n\nAnderson\u2019s production on the ballad is irretrievably country, as it is on the foreboding \u201c1,000 Miles,\u201d which finds a man boarding \u201cflight 209\u201d and ruminating on his broken marriage.  The song's elusive lyrics are filled with self-pity and self-loathing (\u201cI owe so much to pride, it\u2019s true: it brought an end to me and you\u2026\u201d) and it features Yoakam\u2019s stellar singing and unique phrasing.  Faster in tempo but no less dark is the suicidal \u201cThis Drinkin\u2019 Will Kill Me,\u201d a tune Yoakam demoed in Nashville in 1981 and chose to close the album with.

It compares human demand with planet Earth's ecological capacity to regenerate. It represents the amount of biologically productive land and sea area needed to regenerate the resources a human \npopulation consumes and to absorb and render harmless the corresponding [[waste]].\nAccording to a 2005 [[Global Footprint Network]] report,<ref name=footprintnetwork>{{cite web|url=http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/data_sources/|title=Data Sources|work=footprintnetwork.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001074513/http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/data_sources/|archivedate=2009-10-01}}</ref> inhabitants of high-income countries live off of 6.4 [[global hectare]]s (gHa), while those from low-income countries live off of a single gHa. For example, while each inhabitant of \n[[Bangladesh]] lives off of what they produce from 0.56 gHa, a [[North America]]n requires 12.5 gHa. Each inhabitant of North America uses 22.3 times as much land as a Bangladeshi. According to the same report, the average number of global hectares per person was 2.1, \nwhile current consumption levels have reached 2.7 hectares per person. In order for the world's population to attain the living standards typical of European countries, the resources of between three and eight planet [[Earth]]s would be required with current levels of efficiency and means of production. In order for world [[economic equality]] to be achieved with the current available resources, proponents say rich countries would have to reduce their [[standard of living]] through degrowth. The constraints on resources would eventually lead to a forced reduction in consumption. Controlled reduction of consumption would \nreduce the trauma of this change assuming no [[technological change]]s increase the planet's [[carrying capacity]].\n\n=== Degrowth and sustainable development<ref>{{harv|Latouche|2009}}, pp. 9-13</ref> ===\nDegrowth thought is in opposition to all forms of [[productivism]] (the belief that economic productivity and growth is the purpose of human organization).

Degrowth therefore sees sustainable development as an [[oxymoron]],<ref name=Latouche/> as any development based on growth in a finite and environmentally stressed world is seen as inherently unsustainable. \nCritics of degrowth argue that a slowing of [[economic growth]] would result in increased [[unemployment]], increased [[poverty]], and decreased income per capita. Many who understand the devastating environmental consequences of growth still advocate for economic growth in the South, even if not in the North. But, a slowing of economic growth would fail to deliver the benefits of degrowth\u2014self-sufficiency, material responsibility\u2014and would indeed lead to decreased employment. Rather, degrowth proponents advocate the complete abandonment of the current (growth) economic model, suggesting that relocalizing and abandoning the global economy in the [[Global South]] would allow people of the South to become more self-sufficient and would end the overconsumption and exploitation of Southern resources by the North.<ref name=Latouche>Latouche, S.

Georgescu-Roegen and Grinevald soon became friends, and Grinevald devoted his research to a closer study of Georgescu-Roegen's work. As a result, in 1979, Grinevald published a French translation of a selection of Georgescu-Roegen's articles entitled ''Demain la d\u00e9croissance: Entropie \u2013 \u00c9cologie \u2013 \u00c9conomie'' ('Tomorrow, the Decline: Entropy \u2013 Ecology \u2013 Economy').<ref name=ngr03/> Georgescu-Roegen, who spoke French fluently, personally approved the use of the term ''d\u00e9croissance'' in the title of the French translation. The book gained influence in French intellectual and academic circles from the outset. Later, the book was expanded and republished in 1995, and once again in 2006; however, the word ''Demain'' ('tomorrow') was removed from the title of the book in the second and third editions.<ref name=jm01/>{{rp|1742}}<ref name=ngr03/><ref name=jg01/>{{rp|15f}}\n\nBy the time Grinevald suggested the term ''d\u00e9croissance'' to form part of the title of the French translation of Georgescu-Roegen's work, this term had already disseminated through French intellectual circles since the early-1970s to signify a deliberate political action to downscale the economy on a permanent and voluntary basis.<ref name=fd01/>{{rp|195}} Simultaneously, but independently, Georgescu-Roegen criticised the ideas of ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' and [[Herman Daly]]'s [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state economy]] in his pointed and polemical article on \"Energy and Economic Myths\", delivered as a series of lectures from 1972 and later at various places, but not published in print before 1975. In this article, Georgescu-Roegen stated the following:\n\n{{cquote | [Authors who] were set exclusively on proving the impossibility of growth ... were easily deluded by a simple, now widespread, but false [[syllogism]]: Since exponential growth in a finite world leads to disasters of all kinds, ecological salvation lies in the stationary state. ... The crucial error consists in not seeing that not only growth, but also a zero-growth state, nay, even a declining state which does not converge toward annihilation, cannot exist forever in a finite environment.<ref name=ngr02/>{{rp|366f}}<br />... [T]he important, yet unnoticed point [is] that ''the necessary conclusion of the arguments in favor of that vision'' [of a stationary state] ''is that the most desirable state is not a stationary, but a declining one.'' Undoubtedly, the current growth must cease, nay, be reversed.<ref name=ngr02/>{{rp|368f}} [Emphasis in original] }}\n\nWhen reading this particular passage of the text, Grinevald realised that no professional economist of any orientation had ever reasoned like this before. Grinevald also realised the striking conceptual resemblance between Georgescu-Roegen's viewpoint and the French debates occurring at the time; this resemblance was captured in the title of the French edition. Taken together, the translation of Georgescu-Roegen's work into French both fed on and gave further impetus to the concept of ''d\u00e9croissance'' in France\u2014and everywhere else in the francophone world\u2014thereby creating something of an intellectual feedback loop.<ref name=jm01/>{{rp|1742}} <ref name=jg01/>{{rp|15f}} <ref name=fd01/>{{rp|197f}}\n\nBy the 2000s, when ''d\u00e9croissance'' was to be translated from French and back into English as the catchy banner for the new social movement, the original term \"decline\" was now deemed inappropriate and misdirected for the purpose: \"Decline\" usually refers to an unexpected, unwelcome and temporary economic [[recession]], something bad to be avoided or quickly overcome. Instead, the [[neologism]] \"degrowth\" was coined to signify a deliberate political action to downscale the economy on a permanent and conscious basis\u2014as in the prevailing French usage of the term\u2014something good to be welcomed and maintained, or so followers believe.<ref name=ck01/>{{rp|548}} <ref name=jg01/>{{rp|15f}} <ref name=gk01/>{{rp|874\u2013876}}\n\nWhen the first international degrowth conference was held in Paris in 2008, the participants honoured Georgescu-Roegen and his work.<ref name=ff01/>{{rp|15f, 28, ''et passim''}} In his [[manifesto]] on ''Petit trait\u00e9 de la d\u00e9croissance sereine'' (\"Farewell to Growth\"), the leading French champion of the degrowth movement, [[Serge Latouche]], credited Georgescu-Roegen as the \"...main theoretical source of degrowth\".<ref name=sl01/> Likewise, Italian degrowth theorist [[Mauro Bonaiuti]] considered Georgescu-Roegen's work to be \"one of the analytical cornerstones of the degrowth perspective\".<ref name=mb01/><!---please recover the page number in this citation--->\n\n=== Serge Latouche ===\n[[File:Serge Latouche - Festival Economia 2012.JPG|thumb|200px|Serge Latouche]]\n[[Serge Latouche]], a professor of economics at the [[University of Paris-Sud]], has noted that:\n\n{{quote|If you try to measure the reduction in the rate of growth by taking into account damages caused to the environment and its consequences on our natural and cultural patrimony, you will generally obtain a result of zero or even negative growth.

The report was finalised in Paris. The main conclusions:\n\n1. Over the last 50 years, the state of nature has deteriorated at an unprecedented and accelerating rate.\n\n2. The main drivers of this deterioration have been changes in land and sea use, exploitation of living beings, climate change, pollution and invasive species. These five drivers, in turn, are caused by societal behaviors, from consumption to governance.\n\n3. Damage to ecosystems undermines 35 of 44 selected UN targets, including the UN General Assembly's  [[Sustainable Development Goals]] for poverty, hunger, health, water, cities' climate, oceans and land. It can cause problems with food, water and humanity's air supply.\n\n4. To fix the problem, humanity will need a transformative change, including [[sustainable agriculture]], reductions in [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] and waste, fishing quotas and collaborative water management. In page 8 the report propose in page 8 of the summary \" enabling visions of a good quality of life that do not entail ever-increasing material consumption\" as one of the main measures.

According to Jean Zin, while the justification for degrowth is valid, it is not a solution to the problem.<ref>''L'\u00e9cologie politique \u00e0 l'\u00e8re de l'information'', Ere, 2006, p. 68-69</ref> However, other Marxist writers have adopted positions close to the de-growth perspective.  For example, [[John Bellamy Foster]]<ref name=\"The Ecological Rift\">https://monthlyreview.org/press/books/pb2181/, Monthly Review Press.</ref> and Fred Magdoff,<ref name=\"Harmony and Ecological Civilization, Monthly review, Vol 44 (2), 1-9\">{{cite web|url=https://monthlyreview.org/2012/06/01/harmony-and-ecological-civilization|title=Harmony and Ecological Civilization: Beyond the Capitalist Alienation of Nature|date=June 2012|work=Monthly Review}}</ref> in common with [[David Harvey]], [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], [[Paul Sweezy]] and others focus on endless [[capital accumulation]] as the basic principle and goal of capitalism. This is the source of economic growth and, in the view of these writers, is unsustainable. Foster and Magdoff develop Marx's own concept of the metabolic rift, something he noted in the exhaustion of soils by capitalist systems of food production, though this is not unique to capitalist systems of food production as seen in the [[Aral Sea]]. Many Degrowth theories and ideas are based on neomarxist theory.<ref name=gd01/>\n\n====Systems theoretical critique====\nIn stressing the negative rather than the positive side(s) of growth, the majority of degrowth proponents remains focused on (de-)growth, thus co-performing and further sustaining the actually criticized unsustainable growth obsession. One way out of this paradox might be in changing the reductionist vision of growth as ultimately an economic concept, which proponents of both growth and degrowth commonly imply, for a broader concept of growth that allows for the observation of growth in other [[Differentiation (sociology)|function systems]] of society. A corresponding recoding of growth-obsessed or capitalist organizations has recently been proposed.<ref name=\"Growth and function.

There is a fixed supply of [[Non-renewable resource|non-renewable resources]], such as [[petroleum]] (oil), and these resources will inevitably be depleted. [[Renewable resource|Renewable resources]] can also be depleted if extracted at unsustainable rates over extended periods. For example, this has occurred with [[caviar]] production in the Caspian Sea.<ref>Bardi, U. (2008) 'Peak Caviar'. The Oil Drum: Europe. http://europe.theoildrum.com/node/4367</ref> There is much concern as to how growing demand for these resources will be met as supplies decrease. Many organizations and governments look to energy technologies such as biofuels, solar cells, and wind turbines to meet the demand gap after peak oil. Others have argued that none of the alternatives could effectively replace versatility and portability of oil.<ref>McGreal, R. 2005. 'Bridging the Gap: Alternatives to Petroleum (Peak Oil Part II)'. Raising the Hammer. http://www.raisethehammer.org/index.asp?id=119</ref> Authors of the book ''Techno-Fix'' criticize technological optimists for overlooking the limitations of technology in solving agricultural and social challenges arising from growth.<ref>Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A.

For renewable resources, demand, and therefore production, must also be brought down to levels that prevent depletion and are environmentally healthy. Moving toward a society that is not dependent on oil is seen as essential to avoiding [[societal collapse]] when non-renewable resources are depleted.<ref>Resilience.org. (October 20, 2009). Peak Oil Reports. http://www.resilience.org/stories/2009-10-20/peak-oil-reports-oct-20</ref>\n\n===Ecological footprint===\n{{Main|Ecological footprint}}\n\nThe ecological footprint is a measure of human demand on the Earth's ecosystems. It compares human demand with planet Earth's ecological capacity to regenerate. It represents the amount of biologically productive land and sea area needed to regenerate the resources a human \npopulation consumes and to absorb and render harmless the corresponding [[waste]].\nAccording to a 2005 [[Global Footprint Network]] report,<ref name=footprintnetwork>{{cite web|url=http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/data_sources/|title=Data Sources|work=footprintnetwork.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001074513/http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/data_sources/|archivedate=2009-10-01}}</ref> inhabitants of high-income countries live off of 6.4 [[global hectare]]s (gHa), while those from low-income countries live off of a single gHa. For example, while each inhabitant of \n[[Bangladesh]] lives off of what they produce from 0.56 gHa, a [[North America]]n requires 12.5 gHa. Each inhabitant of North America uses 22.3 times as much land as a Bangladeshi. According to the same report, the average number of global hectares per person was 2.1, \nwhile current consumption levels have reached 2.7 hectares per person. In order for the world's population to attain the living standards typical of European countries, the resources of between three and eight planet [[Earth]]s would be required with current levels of efficiency and means of production. In order for world [[economic equality]] to be achieved with the current available resources, proponents say rich countries would have to reduce their [[standard of living]] through degrowth. The constraints on resources would eventually lead to a forced reduction in consumption. Controlled reduction of consumption would \nreduce the trauma of this change assuming no [[technological change]]s increase the planet's [[carrying capacity]].\n\n=== Degrowth and sustainable development<ref>{{harv|Latouche|2009}}, pp. 9-13</ref> ===\nDegrowth thought is in opposition to all forms of [[productivism]] (the belief that economic productivity and growth is the purpose of human organization).  It is, thus, opposed to the current form of [[sustainable development]].<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2011.08.008 |title = Strong sustainable consumption governance \u2013 precondition for a degrowth path?|journal = Journal of Cleaner Production|volume = 38|pages = 36\u201343|year = 2013|last1 = Lorek|first1 = Sylvia|last2 = Fuchs|first2 = Doris|url = https://degrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Lorek-_Fuchs-2013.pdf}}</ref>  While the concern for [[sustainability]] does not contradict degrowth, sustainable development is rooted in mainstream [[international development|development]] ideas that aim to increase capitalist growth and consumption. Degrowth therefore sees sustainable development as an [[oxymoron]],<ref name=Latouche/> as any development based on growth in a finite and environmentally stressed world is seen as inherently unsustainable. \nCritics of degrowth argue that a slowing of [[economic growth]] would result in increased [[unemployment]], increased [[poverty]], and decreased income per capita. Many who understand the devastating environmental consequences of growth still advocate for economic growth in the South, even if not in the North. But, a slowing of economic growth would fail to deliver the benefits of degrowth\u2014self-sufficiency, material responsibility\u2014and would indeed lead to decreased employment. Rather, degrowth proponents advocate the complete abandonment of the current (growth) economic model, suggesting that relocalizing and abandoning the global economy in the [[Global South]] would allow people of the South to become more self-sufficient and would end the overconsumption and exploitation of Southern resources by the North.<ref name=Latouche>Latouche, S.

Georgescu-Roegen and Grinevald soon became friends, and Grinevald devoted his research to a closer study of Georgescu-Roegen's work. As a result, in 1979, Grinevald published a French translation of a selection of Georgescu-Roegen's articles entitled ''Demain la d\u00e9croissance: Entropie \u2013 \u00c9cologie \u2013 \u00c9conomie'' ('Tomorrow, the Decline: Entropy \u2013 Ecology \u2013 Economy').<ref name=ngr03/> Georgescu-Roegen, who spoke French fluently, personally approved the use of the term ''d\u00e9croissance'' in the title of the French translation. The book gained influence in French intellectual and academic circles from the outset. Later, the book was expanded and republished in 1995, and once again in 2006; however, the word ''Demain'' ('tomorrow') was removed from the title of the book in the second and third editions.<ref name=jm01/>{{rp|1742}}<ref name=ngr03/><ref name=jg01/>{{rp|15f}}\n\nBy the time Grinevald suggested the term ''d\u00e9croissance'' to form part of the title of the French translation of Georgescu-Roegen's work, this term had already disseminated through French intellectual circles since the early-1970s to signify a deliberate political action to downscale the economy on a permanent and voluntary basis.<ref name=fd01/>{{rp|195}} Simultaneously, but independently, Georgescu-Roegen criticised the ideas of ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' and [[Herman Daly]]'s [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state economy]] in his pointed and polemical article on \"Energy and Economic Myths\", delivered as a series of lectures from 1972 and later at various places, but not published in print before 1975. In this article, Georgescu-Roegen stated the following:\n\n{{cquote | [Authors who] were set exclusively on proving the impossibility of growth ... were easily deluded by a simple, now widespread, but false [[syllogism]]: Since exponential growth in a finite world leads to disasters of all kinds, ecological salvation lies in the stationary state. ... The crucial error consists in not seeing that not only growth, but also a zero-growth state, nay, even a declining state which does not converge toward annihilation, cannot exist forever in a finite environment.<ref name=ngr02/>{{rp|366f}}<br />... [T]he important, yet unnoticed point [is] that ''the necessary conclusion of the arguments in favor of that vision'' [of a stationary state] ''is that the most desirable state is not a stationary, but a declining one.'' Undoubtedly, the current growth must cease, nay, be reversed.<ref name=ngr02/>{{rp|368f}} [Emphasis in original] }}\n\nWhen reading this particular passage of the text, Grinevald realised that no professional economist of any orientation had ever reasoned like this before. Grinevald also realised the striking conceptual resemblance between Georgescu-Roegen's viewpoint and the French debates occurring at the time; this resemblance was captured in the title of the French edition. Taken together, the translation of Georgescu-Roegen's work into French both fed on and gave further impetus to the concept of ''d\u00e9croissance'' in France\u2014and everywhere else in the francophone world\u2014thereby creating something of an intellectual feedback loop.<ref name=jm01/>{{rp|1742}} <ref name=jg01/>{{rp|15f}} <ref name=fd01/>{{rp|197f}}\n\nBy the 2000s, when ''d\u00e9croissance'' was to be translated from French and back into English as the catchy banner for the new social movement, the original term \"decline\" was now deemed inappropriate and misdirected for the purpose: \"Decline\" usually refers to an unexpected, unwelcome and temporary economic [[recession]], something bad to be avoided or quickly overcome. Instead, the [[neologism]] \"degrowth\" was coined to signify a deliberate political action to downscale the economy on a permanent and conscious basis\u2014as in the prevailing French usage of the term\u2014something good to be welcomed and maintained, or so followers believe.<ref name=ck01/>{{rp|548}} <ref name=jg01/>{{rp|15f}} <ref name=gk01/>{{rp|874\u2013876}}\n\nWhen the first international degrowth conference was held in Paris in 2008, the participants honoured Georgescu-Roegen and his work.<ref name=ff01/>{{rp|15f, 28, ''et passim''}} In his [[manifesto]] on ''Petit trait\u00e9 de la d\u00e9croissance sereine'' (\"Farewell to Growth\"), the leading French champion of the degrowth movement, [[Serge Latouche]], credited Georgescu-Roegen as the \"...main theoretical source of degrowth\".<ref name=sl01/> Likewise, Italian degrowth theorist [[Mauro Bonaiuti]] considered Georgescu-Roegen's work to be \"one of the analytical cornerstones of the degrowth perspective\".<ref name=mb01/><!---please recover the page number in this citation--->\n\n=== Serge Latouche ===\n[[File:Serge Latouche - Festival Economia 2012.JPG|thumb|200px|Serge Latouche]]\n[[Serge Latouche]], a professor of economics at the [[University of Paris-Sud]], has noted that:\n\n{{quote|If you try to measure the reduction in the rate of growth by taking into account damages caused to the environment and its consequences on our natural and cultural patrimony, you will generally obtain a result of zero or even negative growth.

The report was finalised in Paris. The main conclusions:\n\n1. Over the last 50 years, the state of nature has deteriorated at an unprecedented and accelerating rate.\n\n2. The main drivers of this deterioration have been changes in land and sea use, exploitation of living beings, climate change, pollution and invasive species. These five drivers, in turn, are caused by societal behaviors, from consumption to governance.\n\n3. Damage to ecosystems undermines 35 of 44 selected UN targets, including the UN General Assembly's  [[Sustainable Development Goals]] for poverty, hunger, health, water, cities' climate, oceans and land.

According to Jean Zin, while the justification for degrowth is valid, it is not a solution to the problem.<ref>''L'\u00e9cologie politique \u00e0 l'\u00e8re de l'information'', Ere, 2006, p. 68-69</ref> However, other Marxist writers have adopted positions close to the de-growth perspective.  For example, [[John Bellamy Foster]]<ref name=\"The Ecological Rift\">https://monthlyreview.org/press/books/pb2181/, Monthly Review Press.</ref> and Fred Magdoff,<ref name=\"Harmony and Ecological Civilization, Monthly review, Vol 44 (2), 1-9\">{{cite web|url=https://monthlyreview.org/2012/06/01/harmony-and-ecological-civilization|title=Harmony and Ecological Civilization: Beyond the Capitalist Alienation of Nature|date=June 2012|work=Monthly Review}}</ref> in common with [[David Harvey]], [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], [[Paul Sweezy]] and others focus on endless [[capital accumulation]] as the basic principle and goal of capitalism. This is the source of economic growth and, in the view of these writers, is unsustainable. Foster and Magdoff develop Marx's own concept of the metabolic rift, something he noted in the exhaustion of soils by capitalist systems of food production, though this is not unique to capitalist systems of food production as seen in the [[Aral Sea]]. Many Degrowth theories and ideas are based on neomarxist theory.<ref name=gd01/>\n\n====Systems theoretical critique====\nIn stressing the negative rather than the positive side(s) of growth, the majority of degrowth proponents remains focused on (de-)growth, thus co-performing and further sustaining the actually criticized unsustainable growth obsession. One way out of this paradox might be in changing the reductionist vision of growth as ultimately an economic concept, which proponents of both growth and degrowth commonly imply, for a broader concept of growth that allows for the observation of growth in other [[Differentiation (sociology)|function systems]] of society.
