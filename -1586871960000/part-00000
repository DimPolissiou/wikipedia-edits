It is the birthplace of [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]], who founded the [[Franciscan]] [[religious order]] in the town in 1208, and [[Clare of Assisi|St. Clare]] (''Chiara d'Offreducci''), the founder of the Poor Sisters, which later became the Order of [[Poor Clares]] after her death. The 19th-century [[Gabriel of Our Lady of Sorrows|Saint Gabriel of Our Lady of Sorrows]] was also born in Assisi.\n\n== History ==\nAround 1000 BC a wave of immigrants settled in the upper [[Tiber]] valley as far as the [[Adriatic Sea]], and also in the neighborhood of Assisi. These were the [[Umbri]]ans, living in small fortified settlements on high ground. From 450 BC these settlements were gradually taken over by the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]]. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] took control of [[central Italy]] after the [[Battle of Sentinum]] in 295 BC. They built the flourishing ''municipium'' Asisium on a series of terraces on Monte Subasio. Roman remains can still be found in Assisi: [[Defensive wall|city walls]], the forum (now Piazza del Comune), a [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatre]], an [[Roman amphitheatre|amphitheatre]] and the Temple of Minerva (now transformed into the Church of [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva (Assisi)|Santa Maria sopra Minerva]]). In 1997, the remains of a Roman villa were also discovered containing several well-preserved rooms with frescoes and mosaics in a condition rarely found outside sites such as [[Pompei]].\n\nIn 238 AD Assisi was [[Christianization|converted to Christianity]] by bishop [[Rufinus of Assisi|Rufino]], who was martyred at [[Costano]]. According to tradition, his remains rest in the Cathedral Church of San Rufino in Assisi.\n\nThe [[Ostrogoths]] of king [[Totila]] destroyed most of the town in 545. Assisi then came under the rule of the [[Lombards]] as part of the Lombard and then Frankish [[Duchy of Spoleto]].\n\nThe thriving [[Medieval commune|commune]] became an independent [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Ghibelline]] commune in the 11th century. Constantly [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|struggling with the Guelph]] [[Perugia]], it was during one of those battles, the battle at Ponte San Giovanni, that Francesco di Bernardone ([[Francis of Assisi|Saint Francis of Assisi]]) was taken prisoner, setting in motion the events that eventually led him to live as a beggar, renounce the world and establish the [[Franciscan|Order of Friars Minor]].\n\n[[File:Assisi Piazza del Comune BW 1.JPG|thumb|left|Temple of Minerva in the Piazza del Comune.]]\nThe city, which had remained within the confines of the Roman walls, began to expand outside these walls in the 13th century. In this period the city was under papal jurisdiction. The [[Rocca Maggiore]], the imperial fortress on top of the hill above the city, which had been plundered by the people in 1189, was rebuilt in 1367 on orders of the [[papal legate]], cardinal [[Gil \u00c1lvarez Carrillo de Albornoz|Gil de Albornoz]].\n\nIn the beginning Assisi fell under the rule of Perugia and later under several despots, such as the soldier of fortune [[Biordo Michelotti]], [[Gian Galeazzo Visconti]] and his successor [[Francesco I Sforza]], dukes of [[Duchy of Milan|Milan]], [[Jacopo Piccinino]] and  [[Federico II da Montefeltro]], lord of [[Urbino]]. The city went into a deep decline through the plague of the [[Black Death]] in 1348.\n\nThe city came again under papal jurisdiction under the rule of [[Pope Pius II]] (1458\u20131464).\n\nIn 1569 construction was started of the [[Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli]]. During the [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance]] and in later centuries, the city continued to develop peacefully, as the 17th-century palazzi of the Bernabei and Giacobetti attest.\n\nNow the site of many a pilgrimage, Assisi is linked in legend with its native son, St. Francis. The gentle saint founded the Franciscan order and shares honors with [[Catherine of Siena|St. Catherine of Siena]] as the [[patron saint]] of Italy. He is remembered by many, even non-Christians, as a lover of nature (his preaching to an audience of birds is one of the legends of his life).\n\n[[File:Basilica di San Francesco, May 2017.jpg|thumb|The basilica in May 2017]]\n\nAssisi was hit by two devastating [[1997 Umbria and Marche earthquake|earthquakes]], that shook [[Umbria]] in September 1997. But the recovery and restoration have been remarkable, although much remains to be done. Massive damage was caused to many historical sites, but the major attraction, the Basilica di San Francesco, reopened less than 2 years later.\n\n== Main sights ==\n[[UNESCO]] collectively designated the Franciscan structures of Assisi as a [[World Heritage Site]] in 2000.\n\n=== Churches ===\n* [[Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi]] (St. Francis): The Franciscan monastery, il [[Sacro Convento]], and the lower and upper church (Italian: ''Basilica inferiore'' and ''Basilica superiore'') of St Francis were begun immediately after his [[canonization]] in 1228, and completed in 1253. The lower church has [[fresco]]es by the [[Late Middle Ages|late-medieval]] artists [[Cimabue]] and [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]]; the upper church houses frescoes of scenes in the life of St. Francis previously ascribed to Giotto, but now thought to be by artists of the circle of [[Pietro Cavallini]] from Rome. The Basilica was badly damaged by a 5.5 earthquake on 26 September 1997, during which part of the vault collapsed, killing four people inside the church and carrying with it a fresco by Cimabue. The edifice was closed for two years for restoration.\n*[[Santa Maria Maggiore, Assisi|Santa Maria Maggiore]] (St. Mary the Greater): earliest extant church in Assisi.\n*[[Assisi Cathedral|Cathedral of San Rufino]] (St. Rufinus): church with a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] [[Facade|fa\u00e7ade]] with three [[rose window]]s and a 16th\u2011century interior; part of it is built on a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[cistern]].\n*[[Basilica di Santa Chiara|Basilica of Santa Chiara]] (St. Clare): church, begun in 1257, with its massive lateral [[buttress|buttresses]], rose window, and simple [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] interior; and 13th\u2011century frescoes and paintings. It contains the [[tomb]] of the [[Saint Clare of Assisi|namesake saint]].\n*[[Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli]] (St. Mary of the Angels); church which houses the [[Porziuncola]].\n*[[Chiesa Nuova (Assisi)|Chiesa Nuova]]: church built over the presumed parental home of St. Francis\n*[[Santo Stefano (Assisi)|Santo Stefano]]: one of the oldest churches of Assisi.\n*[[Eremo delle Carceri]]: a small monastery with church at a canyon above the town, where St. Francis retreated and preached to birds\n*[[Abbey of Saint Peters (Assisi)|Church of ''San Pietro'' (St. Peter)]]: monastery built by the [[Benedictine order|Benedictine]]s in the 10th century and rebuilt in the 13th century. It has a rectangular fa\u00e7ade with three [[rose windows]]; the Gothic chapel of the Holy Sacrament houses a triptych by [[Matteo di Gualdo]].\n\n=== Other landmarks ===\n[[File:Assisi02.jpg|thumb|[[Eremo delle Carceri]].]]\nThe town is dominated by two medieval [[castle]]s. The larger, called ''[[Rocca Maggiore]]'', is a massive reconstruction by [[Gil \u00c1lvarez Carrillo de Albornoz|Cardinal Albornoz]] (1366) and expanded  by popes [[Pope Pius II|Pius II]] (polygonal tower, 1458) and [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]] (the cylindrical bastion near the entrance, 1535-1538). The smaller of the two was built in [[Roman era]]: it has been only partially reserved, a small portion and three towers being open to the public.\n\nOther sights include:\n*the Roman [[amphitheater]], built in the early 1st century AD. Its elliptical plan is identifiable from the medieval houses built around it, and from an arch of travertine cunei. The arena now houses a garden.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/413037 |title=Places: 413037 (Asisium) |author1=Harris, W. |author2=DARMC, R. Talbert |author3=S.

The [[Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi]] includes a number of artistic works. Simone Martini's 1317 fresco there reflects the influence of [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]] in [[realism (arts)|realism]] and the use of brilliant colors.

It is the birthplace of [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]], who founded the [[Franciscan]] [[religious order]] in the town in 1208, and [[Clare of Assisi|St. Clare]] (''Chiara d'Offreducci''), the founder of the Poor Sisters, which later became the Order of [[Poor Clares]] after her death. The 19th-century [[Gabriel of Our Lady of Sorrows|Saint Gabriel of Our Lady of Sorrows]] was also born in Assisi.\n\n== History ==\nAround 1000 BC a wave of immigrants settled in the upper [[Tiber]] valley as far as the [[Adriatic Sea]], and also in the neighborhood of Assisi. These were the [[Umbri]]ans, living in small fortified settlements on high ground. From 450 BC these settlements were gradually taken over by the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]]. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] took control of [[central Italy]] after the [[Battle of Sentinum]] in 295 BC. They built the flourishing ''municipium'' Asisium on a series of terraces on Monte Subasio. Roman remains can still be found in Assisi: [[Defensive wall|city walls]], the forum (now Piazza del Comune), a [[Roman theatre (structure)|theatre]], an [[Roman amphitheatre|amphitheatre]] and the Temple of Minerva (now transformed into the Church of [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva (Assisi)|Santa Maria sopra Minerva]]). In 1997, the remains of a Roman villa were also discovered containing several well-preserved rooms with frescoes and mosaics in a condition rarely found outside sites such as [[Pompei]].\n\nIn 238 AD Assisi was [[Christianization|converted to Christianity]] by bishop [[Rufinus of Assisi|Rufino]], who was martyred at [[Costano]]. According to tradition, his remains rest in the Cathedral Church of San Rufino in Assisi.\n\nThe [[Ostrogoths]] of king [[Totila]] destroyed most of the town in 545. Assisi then came under the rule of the [[Lombards]] as part of the Lombard and then Frankish [[Duchy of Spoleto]].\n\nThe thriving [[Medieval commune|commune]] became an independent [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Ghibelline]] commune in the 11th century. Constantly [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|struggling with the Guelph]] [[Perugia]], it was during one of those battles, the battle at Ponte San Giovanni, that Francesco di Bernardone ([[Francis of Assisi|Saint Francis of Assisi]]) was taken prisoner, setting in motion the events that eventually led him to live as a beggar, renounce the world and establish the [[Franciscan|Order of Friars Minor]].\n\n[[File:Assisi Piazza del Comune BW 1.JPG|thumb|left|Temple of Minerva in the Piazza del Comune.]]\nThe city, which had remained within the confines of the Roman walls, began to expand outside these walls in the 13th century. In this period the city was under papal jurisdiction. The [[Rocca Maggiore]], the imperial fortress on top of the hill above the city, which had been plundered by the people in 1189, was rebuilt in 1367 on orders of the [[papal legate]], cardinal [[Gil \u00c1lvarez Carrillo de Albornoz|Gil de Albornoz]].\n\nIn the beginning Assisi fell under the rule of Perugia and later under several despots, such as the soldier of fortune [[Biordo Michelotti]], [[Gian Galeazzo Visconti]] and his successor [[Francesco I Sforza]], dukes of [[Duchy of Milan|Milan]], [[Jacopo Piccinino]] and  [[Federico II da Montefeltro]], lord of [[Urbino]]. The city went into a deep decline through the plague of the [[Black Death]] in 1348.\n\nThe city came again under papal jurisdiction under the rule of [[Pope Pius II]] (1458\u20131464).\n\nIn 1569 construction was started of the [[Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli]]. During the [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance]] and in later centuries, the city continued to develop peacefully, as the 17th-century palazzi of the Bernabei and Giacobetti attest.\n\nNow the site of many a pilgrimage, Assisi is linked in legend with its native son, St. Francis. The gentle saint founded the Franciscan order and shares honors with [[Catherine of Siena|St. Catherine of Siena]] as the [[patron saint]] of Italy. He is remembered by many, even non-Christians, as a lover of nature (his preaching to an audience of birds is one of the legends of his life).\n\n[[File:Basilica di San Francesco, May 2017.jpg|thumb|The basilica in May 2017]]\n\nAssisi was hit by two devastating [[1997 Umbria and Marche earthquake|earthquakes]], that shook [[Umbria]] in September 1997. But the recovery and restoration have been remarkable, although much remains to be done. Massive damage was caused to many historical sites, but the major attraction, the Basilica di San Francesco, reopened less than 2 years later.\n\n== Main sights ==\n[[UNESCO]] collectively designated the Franciscan structures of Assisi as a [[World Heritage Site]] in 2000.\n\n=== Churches ===\n* [[Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi]] (St. Francis): The Franciscan monastery, il [[Sacro Convento]], and the lower and upper church (Italian: ''Basilica inferiore'' and ''Basilica superiore'') of St Francis were begun immediately after his [[canonization]] in 1228, and completed in 1253. The lower church has [[fresco]]es by the [[Late Middle Ages|late-medieval]] artists [[Cimabue]] and [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]]; the upper church houses frescoes of scenes in the life of St. Francis previously ascribed to Giotto, but now thought to be by artists of the circle of [[Pietro Cavallini]] from Rome. The Basilica was badly damaged by a 5.5 earthquake on 26 September 1997, during which part of the vault collapsed, killing four people inside the church and carrying with it a fresco by Cimabue. The edifice was closed for two years for restoration.\n*[[Santa Maria Maggiore, Assisi|Santa Maria Maggiore]] (St. Mary the Greater): earliest extant church in Assisi.\n*[[Assisi Cathedral|Cathedral of San Rufino]] (St. Rufinus): church with a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] [[Facade|fa\u00e7ade]] with three [[rose window]]s and a 16th\u2011century interior; part of it is built on a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[cistern]].\n*[[Basilica di Santa Chiara|Basilica of Santa Chiara]] (St. Clare): church, begun in 1257, with its massive lateral [[buttress|buttresses]], rose window, and simple [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] interior; and 13th\u2011century frescoes and paintings. It contains the [[tomb]] of the [[Saint Clare of Assisi|namesake saint]].\n*[[Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli]] (St. Mary of the Angels); church which houses the [[Porziuncola]].\n*[[Chiesa Nuova (Assisi)|Chiesa Nuova]]: church built over the presumed parental home of St. Francis\n*[[Santo Stefano (Assisi)|Santo Stefano]]: one of the oldest churches of Assisi.\n*[[Eremo delle Carceri]]: a small monastery with church at a canyon above the town, where St. Francis retreated and preached to birds\n*[[Abbey of Saint Peters (Assisi)|Church of ''San Pietro'' (St. Peter)]]: monastery built by the [[Benedictine order|Benedictine]]s in the 10th century and rebuilt in the 13th century. It has a rectangular fa\u00e7ade with three [[rose windows]]; the Gothic chapel of the Holy Sacrament houses a triptych by [[Matteo di Gualdo]].\n\n=== Other landmarks ===\n[[File:Assisi02.jpg|thumb|[[Eremo delle Carceri]].]]\nThe town is dominated by two medieval [[castle]]s. The larger, called ''[[Rocca Maggiore]]'', is a massive reconstruction by [[Gil \u00c1lvarez Carrillo de Albornoz|Cardinal Albornoz]] (1366) and expanded  by popes [[Pope Pius II|Pius II]] (polygonal tower, 1458) and [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]] (the cylindrical bastion near the entrance, 1535-1538). The smaller of the two was built in [[Roman era]]: it has been only partially reserved, a small portion and three towers being open to the public.\n\nOther sights include:\n*the Roman [[amphitheater]], built in the early 1st century AD. Its elliptical plan is identifiable from the medieval houses built around it, and from an arch of travertine cunei. The arena now houses a garden.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/413037 |title=Places: 413037 (Asisium) |author1=Harris, W. |author2=DARMC, R. Talbert |author3=S.

In 1793, that government declared a mass conscription (''lev\u00e9e en masse'') with a call to service:<blockquote>Henceforth, until the enemies have been driven from the territory of the Republic, all the French are in permanent requisition for army service.

Revanchism draws its strength from patriotic and retributionist thought and it is often motivated by economic or geo-political factors. Extreme revanchist ideologues often represent a hawkish stance, suggesting that their desired objectives can be achieved through the positive outcome of another war. It is linked with irredentism, the conception that a part of the cultural and ethnic nation remains \"unredeemed\" outside the borders of its appropriate nation state. Revanchist politics often rely on the identification of a nation with a nation state, often mobilizing deep-rooted sentiments of ethnic nationalism, claiming territories outside the state where members of the ethnic group live, while using heavy-handed nationalism to mobilize support for these aims. Revanchist justifications are often presented as based on ancient or even autochthonous occupation of a territory since \"time immemorial\", an assertion that is usually inextricably involved in revanchism and irredentism, justifying them in the eyes of their proponents.<ref>Karine Varley, \"The Taboos of Defeat: Unmentionable Memories of the Franco-Prussian War in France, 1870\u20131914.\" in Jenny Macleod, ed., ''Defeat and Memory: Cultural Histories of Military Defeat in the Modern Era'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2008) pp. 62\u201380.</ref>\n\nThe [[Dreyfus Affair]] in France 1894\u20131906 made the battle against treason and disloyalty a central theme for conservative Catholic French nationalists.

He idealized the Hohenzollern kings of Prussia.  His large-scale ''History of Prussian Politics'' (14 vol 1855\u20131886) was foundational for nationalistic students and scholars.

It was the political and intellectual movement that consolidated the different states of the [[Italian peninsula]] into the single state of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861. The memory of the ''Risorgimento'' is central to Italian nationalism but it was based in the liberal [[middle class]]es and ultimately proved weak.<ref>Silvana Patriarca and Lucy Riall, eds., ''The Risorgimento Revisited: Nationalism and Culture in Nineteenth-century Italy'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2011).</ref>   Two major groups remained opposed, \nthose from the [[Southern Italy|South or \"Mezzogiorno\"]] (formerly known as the [[Kingdom of the two Sicilies]]) and the devout Catholics. The new government treated the newly-annexed South as a conquered province with ridicule for its \"backward\" and poverty-stricken society, its poor grasp of standard Italian (as [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian]] dialects of [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] and [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] were prevalent in the common use) and its traditions. The liberals had always been strong opponents of the [[pope]] and the very well organized [[Catholic Church]]. The pope had been in political control of [[central Italy]]; he lost that in 1860 and Rome as well in 1870. He had long been the leader of opposition to modern liberalism and refused to accept the terms offered by the new Italian government. He called himself a \"prisoner\" in the Vatican and [[Non expedit|forbade Catholics]] to vote or engage in politics. The Catholic alienation lasted until 1929. The liberal government under the Sicilian [[Francesco Crispi]] sought to enlarge his political base by emulating [[Otto von Bismarck]] and firing up [[Italian nationalism]] with a hyper-aggressive foreign policy. It crashed and his cause was set back. Historian [[R. J. B. Bosworth|R.J.B. Bosworth]] says of his nationalistic foreign policy that:\n{{quote|(Crispi) pursued policies whose openly aggressive character would not be equaled until the days of the Fascist regime. Crispi increased military expenditure, talked cheerfully of a European conflagration, and alarmed his German or British friends with this suggestions of preventative attacks on his enemies.  His policies were ruinous, both for Italy's trade with France, and, more humiliatingly, for colonial ambitions in East Africa. Crispi's lust for territory there was thwarted when on 1 March 1896, the armies of Ethiopian Emperor Menelik routed Italian forces at [[Battle of Adwa|Adowa]] ... in what has been defined as an unparalleled disaster for a modern army.

Italy joined the [[Allies of World War I|Allies in the First World War]] after getting promises of territory, but its war effort was a fiasco that discredited liberalism and paved the way for [[Benito Mussolini]] and a political doctrine of his own creation, fascism. Mussolini's 20-year dictatorship involved a highly aggressive nationalism that led to a series of wars, an alliance with Hitler's Germany, and humiliation and hardship in the Second World War.

Large-scale nationalist revolts erupted [[November Uprising|in 1830]] and [[January Uprising|1863\u201364]] but were harshly crushed by Russia, which tried to make the [[Polish language]], [[Culture of Poland|culture]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|religion]] more like Russia's. The collapse of the Russian Empire in the First World War enabled the major powers to re-establish an independent Poland, which survived until 1939.  Meanwhile, Poles in areas controlled by Germany moved into heavy industry but their religion came under attack by Bismarck in the [[Kulturkampf]] of the 1870s.  The Poles joined German Catholics in a well-organized new [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], and defeated Bismarck politically.

This term originated from the word ''[[Zion]]'', which was one of the [[Torah]]'s names for the city of [[Jerusalem]]. The end goal of the nationalists and Zionists was a Jewish majority and in most cases, a state, in the [[Land of Israel|land of Palestine]]. A tumultuous history of living in oppressive, foreign, and uncertain circumstances led the supporters of the movement to draft a declaration of independence, claiming Israel as a birthplace. The first and second destructions of the temple and ancient Torah prophecies largely shaped the incentives of the Jewish nationalists. Many prominent theories in Jewish theology and eschatology were formed by supporters and opponents of the movement in this era.\n\nIt was the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, which sparked new waves of thinking across Europe regarding governance and sovereignty. A shift from the traditional hierarchy-based system towards political individualism and citizen-states posed a dilemma for the Jews. Citizenship was now essential, when it came to ensuring basic legal and residential rights. This resulted in more and more Jews choosing to identify with certain nationalities in order to maintain these rights. Logic said that a nation-based system of states  would require the Jews themselves to claim their own right to be considered a nation due to a distinguishable language and history. Historian David Engel has explained that Zionism was more about fear that a majority of worldwide Jews would end up dispersed and unprotected, rather than fulfilling old prophecies and traditions of historical texts.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Zionism|last=David|first=Engel|publisher=Pearson Longman Publishing Group|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n===20th century===\n\n====China====\n{{main|Chinese nationalism}}\nThe awakening of nationalism across Asia helped shape the history of the continent.

According to historian Patricia Ebrey:\n:Nationalism, patriotism, progress, science, democracy, and freedom were the goals; [[imperialism]], [[feudalism]], [[warlordism]], autocracy, [[patriarchy]], and blind adherence to tradition were the enemies.

It promoted [[Culture of Greece|Greek traditions]], [[Greek folk music|folk music]] and [[Greek dances|dances]], [[classicism]] as well as [[medievalism]].\n\n====Africa====\n{{main|African nationalism|History of Africa}}\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-124-8.jpg|thumb|[[Kenneth Kaunda]], an anti-colonial political leader from [[Zambia]], pictured at a nationalist rally in colonial [[Northern Rhodesia]] (now [[Zambia]]) in 1960]]\n\nIn the 1880s the European powers divided up almost all of Africa (only [[Ethiopia]] and [[Liberia]] were independent). They ruled until after World War II when forces of nationalism grew much stronger.  In the 1950s and 1960s the colonial holdings became independent states. The process was usually peaceful but there were several long bitter bloody civil wars, as in Algeria,<ref>Alistair Horne, ''A savage war of peace: Algeria 1954\u20131962'' (1977).</ref> Kenya<ref>David Anderson, ''Histories of the hanged: The dirty war in Kenya and the end of empire'' (2005).</ref> and elsewhere.\nAcross Africa nationalism drew upon the organizational skills that natives learned in the British and French and other armies in the world wars. It led to organizations that were not controlled by or endorsed by either the colonial powers nor the traditional local power structures that were collaborating with the colonial powers. Nationalistic organizations began to challenge both the traditional and the new colonial structures and finally displaced them.  Leaders of nationalist movements took control when the European authorities exited; many ruled for decades or until they died off. These structures included political, educational, religious, and other social organizations. In recent decades, many African countries have undergone the triumph and defeat of nationalistic fervor, changing in the process the loci of the centralizing state power and patrimonial state.<ref>Gabriel Almond and James S. Coleman, ''The Politics of the Developing Areas'' (1971)</ref><ref>Festus Ugboaja Ohaegbulam, ''Nationalism in colonial and post-colonial Africa'' (University Press of America, 1977).</ref><ref>Thomas Hodgkin, ''Nationalism in Colonial Africa'' (1956)</ref>\n\n[[History of South Africa|South Africa]], a British colony, was exceptional in that it became virtually independent by 1931. From 1948 it was controlled by white [[Afrikaner]] nationalists focused on racial segregation and white minority rule known officially as [[apartheid]], which lasted until 1994, when [[1994 South African general election|elections]] were held. The black nationalist movement fought them until success was achieved and [[Nelson Mandela]] was elected President.<ref>Nancy L. Clark and William H. Worger, ''South Africa: The rise and fall of apartheid'' (Routledge, 2013).</ref>\n\n==== Middle East ====\n[[Arab nationalism]], a movement toward liberating and empowering the Arab peoples of the Middle East, emerged during the latter 19th century, inspired by other independence movements of the 18th and 19th centuries. As the [[Ottoman Empire]] declined and the Middle East was carved up by the Great Powers of Europe, Arabs sought to establish their own independent nations ruled by Arabs rather than foreigners. [[Syria]] was established in 1920; Transjordan (later [[Jordan]]) gradually gained independence between 1921 and 1946; [[Saudi Arabia]] was established in 1932; and [[Egypt]] achieved gradually gained independence between 1922 and 1952. The [[Arab League]] was established in 1945 to promote Arab interests and cooperation between the new Arab states.\n\nParallel to these efforts was the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]] which emerged among European Jews in the 19th century. Beginning in 1882 Jews, predominantly from Europe, began emigrating to [[Ottoman Palestine]] with the goal of establishing a new Jewish homeland. The effort culminated in the declaration of the [[State of Israel]] in 1948. As this move conflicted with the belief among Arab nationalists that Palestine was part of the Arab nation, the neighboring Arab nations [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War|launched an invasion]] to claim the region. The invasion was only partly successful and led to decades of clashes between the Arab and Jewish nationalist ideologies.\n\n==== Post-Communism ====\nThere was a rise in extreme nationalism after the [[Revolutions of 1989]] triggered the collapse of [[communism]] in the 1990s. When communism fell, it left many people with no identity. The people under communist rule had to integrate, and they found themselves free to choose. Given free choice, long dormant conflicts rose up and created sources of serious conflict.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Berg|first=Steven|date=1993|title=Nationalism Redux: Through the Glass of the Post-Communist States Darkly.|url=|journal=Ethnic Conflicts WorldWide, Current History|volume=|pages=162\u201366|via=}}</ref> When communism fell in Yugoslavia, serious conflict arose, which led to the rise in extreme nationalism.\n\nIn his 1992 article ''Jihad vs. McWorld,'' [[Benjamin Barber]] proposed that the fall of communism will cause large numbers of people to search for unity and that small scale wars will become common; groups will attempt to redraw boundaries, identities, cultures and ideologies.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Barber|first=Benjamin|date=1992|title=Jihad vs. McWorld: the two axial principles of our age\u2014tribalism and globalism\u2014clash at every point except one: they may both be threatening to democracy|url=|journal=The Atlantic|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Communism's fall also allowed for an  \"us vs. them\" mentality to sprout up.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Huntington|first=Samuel|date=1993|title=The Clash of Civilizations|url=|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=72|issue=3|pages=22\u201349|doi=10.2307/20045621|jstor=20045621}}</ref> Governments become vehicles for social interests and the country will attempt to form national policies based on the majority, for example culture, religion or ethnicity.<ref name=\":0\" /> Some newly sprouted democracies have large differences in policies on matters that ranged from immigration and human rights to trade and commerce.\n\nAcademic Steven Berg felt that at the root of nationalist conflicts is the demand for autonomy and a separate existence.<ref name=\":0\" /> This nationalism can give rise to strong emotions that may lead to a group fighting to survive, especially as after the fall of communism, political boundaries did not match ethnic boundaries.<ref name=\":0\" /> Serious conflicts often arose and escalated very easily as individuals and groups acted upon their beliefs, causing death and destruction.<ref name=\":0\" /> When this would happen, those states who were unable to contain the conflict ran the risk of slowing their democratization progress.\n\nYugoslavia was established after WWI and was a merger of three separate ethnic groups; Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.  The national census numbers for a ten-year span 1971\u20131981 measured an increase from 1.3 to 5.4% in their population that ethnically identified as Yugoslav.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Berg|first=Steven|date=2004|title=Why Yugoslavia Fell Apart|url=|journal=Current History|volume=92:577|pages=357\u201363|via=}}</ref> This meant that the country, almost as a whole, was divided by distinctive religious, ethnic or national loyalties after nearly 50 years.\n\nWithin Yugoslavia, separating Croatia and Slovenia from the rest of Yugoslavia is an invisible line of previous conquests of the region. Croatia and Slovenia to the northwest were conquered by Catholics or Protestants, and benefited from European history; the Renaissance, French Revolution, Industrial Revolution and are more inclined towards democracy.<ref name=\":2\" /> The remaining Yugoslavian territory was conquered by the Ottoman or Tsarists empires; are Orthodox or Muslims, are less economically advanced and are less inclined toward democracy.\n\nIn the 1970s the leadership of the separate territories within Yugoslavia protected only territorial interests at the expense of other territories. In Croatia, there was almost a split within the territory between Serbs and Croats so any political decision would kindle unrest, and tensions could cross the territories adjacent; Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref name=\":3\" /> Within Bosnia there was no group who had a majority; Muslim, Serb, Croat, and Yugoslav were all there so the leadership could not advance here either.  Political organizations were not able to deal successfully with such diverse nationalism. Within the territories the leadership could not compromise. To do so would create a winner in one ethnic group and a loser in another, raising the possibility of a serious conflict.  This strengthened the political stance promoting ethnic identities. This caused intense and divided political leadership within Yugoslavia.\n[[File:Cold War border changes.png|thumb|250px|[[List of national border changes since World War I|Changes in national boundaries]] in post-Soviet states after the collapse of communism followed by a resurgence of nationalism.]]\nIn the 1980s Yugoslavia began to break into fragments.<ref name=\":1\" /> The economic conditions within Yugoslavia were deteriorating. Conflict in the disputed territories was stimulated by the rise in mass nationalism and inter-ethnic hostilities.<ref name=\":3\" /> The per-capita income of people in the northwest territory, encompassing Croatia and Slovenia, in contrast to the southern territory were several times higher. This combined with escalating violence from ethnic Albanians and Serbs within Kosovo intensified economic conditions.<ref name=\":3\" /> This violence greatly contributed to the rise of extreme nationalism of Serbs in Serbia and within Yugoslavia. The ongoing conflict in Kosovo was propagandized by Communist Serbian Slobodan Milosevic to further increase Serb nationalism. As mentioned, this nationalism did give rise to powerful emotions which grew the force of Serbian nationalism through highly nationalist demonstrations in Vojvodina, Serbia, Montenegro, and Kosovo. Serbian nationalism was so high, Slobodan Milosevic was able to oust leaders in Vojvodina and Montenegro, further repressed Albanians within Kosovo and eventually controlled four of the eight regions/territories.<ref name=\":3\" /> Slovenia, one of the four regions not under Communist control, favoring a democratic state.\n\nWithin Slovenia, fear was mounting because Milosevic was using the militia to suppress a in Kosovo, what would he do to Slovenia.<ref name=\":3\" /> Half of Yugoslavia wanted to be democratic, the other wanted a new nationalist authoritarian regime. In fall of 1989 tensions came to a head and Slovenia asserted its political and economic independence from Yugoslavia and seceded. In January 1990, there was a total break with Serbia at the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, an institution conceived by Milosevic to strengthen unity and became the backdrop for the fall of communism within Yugoslavia.\n\nIn August 1990, a warning to the region was issued when ethnically divided groups attempted to alter the government structure. The republic borders established by the Communist regime in the postwar period were extremely vulnerable to challenges from ethnic communities.Ethnic communities arose because they did not share the identity with everyone within the new post-Communist borders.<ref name=\":3\" /> This threatened the new governments. The same disputes were erupting that were in place prior to Milosevic and were compounded by actions from his regime.\n\nAlso within the territory the Croats and the Serbs were in direct competition for control of government. Elections were held and increased potential conflicts between Serb and Croat nationalism. Serbia wanted to be separate and decide its own future based on its own ethnic composition. But this would then give Kosovo encouragement to become independent from Serbia. Albanians in Kosovo were already independent from Kosovo. Serbia didn't want to let Kosovo become independent. Muslims nationalists wanted their own territory but it would require a redrawing of the map, and would threaten neighboring territories. When communism fell in Yugoslavia, serious conflict arose, which led to the rise in extreme nationalism.\n\nNationalism again gave rise to powerful emotions which evoked in some extreme cases, a willingness to die for what you believe in, a fight for the survival of the group.<ref name=\":0\" /> The end of communism began a long period of conflict and war for the region. In the six years following the collapse 200,000-500-000 people died in the Bosnian war.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ramet|first=Sabrina|date=1996|title=Eastern Europe's Painful Transition|url=|journal=Current History|volume=|pages=97\u2013102|via=}}</ref> Bosnian Muslims suffered at the hands of the Serbs and Croats.<ref name=\":2\" /> The war garnered assistance from groups; Muslim, Orthodox and Western Christian as well as state actors who supplied all sides; Saudi Arabia and Iran supported Bosnia, Russia supported Serbia, Central European and Western countries including the U.S. supported Croatia, and the Pope supported Slovenia and Croatia.\n\n===21st century===\n{{main|Neo-nationalism}}\n\n[[Arab nationalism]] began to decline in the 21st century leading to localized nationalism, culminating in a series of revolts against authoritarian regimes between 2010 and 2012, known as the ''[[Arab Spring]]''. Following these revolts, which mostly failed to improve conditions in the affected nations, Arab nationalism and even most local nationalistic movements declined dramatically.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=What is the point of the Arab League? |date=29 April 2016 |magazine=The Economist |url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21698047-sad-decline-once-bold-organisation-what-point-arab-league}}</ref> A consequence of the [[Arab Spring]] as well as the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] were the [[Iraqi Civil War (2014\u20132017)|civil wars in Iraq]] and [[Syrian Civil War|Syria]], which eventually joined to form a [[Spillover of the Syrian Civil War|single conflict]].

Hayes]], [[Henry Maine]], [[Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]], [[Arnold Joseph Toynbee]] and [[Talcott Parsons]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=508\u201309}}\n\nHenry Maine in his analysis of the historical changes and development of human societies noted the key distinction between traditional societies defined as \"status\" societies based on family association and functionally diffuse roles for individuals; and modern societies defined as \"contract\" societies where social relations are determined by rational contracts pursued by individuals to advance their interests. Maine saw the development of societies as moving away from traditional status societies to modern contract societies.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\nFerdinand T\u00f6nnies in his book ''[[Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft]]'' (1887) defined a ''Gemeinschaft'' (community) as being based on emotional attachments as attributed with traditional societies, while defining a ''Gesellschaft'' (society) as an impersonal society that is modern. While he recognized the advantages of modern societies he also criticized them for their cold and impersonal nature that caused [[Social alienation|alienation]] while praising the intimacy of traditional communities.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\n\u00c9mile Durkheim expanded upon T\u00f6nnies' recognition of alienation, and defined the differences between traditional and modern societies as being between societies based upon \"mechanical solidarity\" versus societies based on \"organic solidarity\".{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}} Durkheim identified mechanical solidarity as involving custom, habit, and repression that was necessary to maintain shared views. Durkheim identified organic solidarity-based societies as modern societies where there exists a division of labour based on social differentiation that causes alienation. Durkheim claimed that social integration in traditional society required authoritarian culture involving acceptance of a social order. Durkheim claimed that modern society bases integration on the mutual benefits of the division of labour, but noted that the impersonal character of modern urban life caused alienation and feelings of [[anomie]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\nMax Weber claimed the change that developed modern society and nations is the result of the rise of a charismatic leader to power in a society who creates a new tradition or a rational-legal system that establishes the supreme authority of the state. Weber's conception of charismatic authority has been noted as the basis of many nationalist governments.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\n===Primordialist evolutionary interpretation===\nAnother approach emerging from biology and psychology looks at long-term evolutionary forces that might lead to nationalism.  The primordialist perspective is based upon evolutionary theory.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=272\u201373}}<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 4236409|title = Evolution, Mobility, and Ethnic Group Formation|journal = Politics and the Life Sciences|volume = 17|issue = 1|pages = 59\u201371|last1 = Goetze|first1 = David|year = 1998|doi = 10.1017/S0730938400025363}}</ref>\n\nThis approach has been popular with the general public but is typically rejected by experts.

Thinkers like [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Walter Bagehot]] reinterpreted Darwin's theory of natural selection \"often in ways inconsistent with Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution\" by making unsupported claims of biological difference among groups, ethnicities, races, and nations.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=495-496}} Modern evolutionary sciences have distanced themselves from such views, but notions of long-term evolutionary change remain foundational to the work of evolutionary psychologists like [[John Tooby]] and [[Leda Cosmides]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=268}}\n\nApproached through the primordialist perspective, the example of seeing the mobilization of a foreign military force on the nation's borders may provoke members of a national group to unify and mobilize themselves in response.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=271}} There are proximate environments where individuals identify nonimmediate real or imagined situations in combination with immediate situations that make individuals confront a common situation of both subjective and objective components that affect their decisions.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=272}} As such proximate environments cause people to make decisions based on existing situations and anticipated situations.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=272}}\n[[File:Maerz1848 berlin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Nationalist and liberal pressure led to the [[Revolutions of 1848|European revolutions of 1848]]]]\n\nCritics argue that primordial models relying on evolutionary psychology are based not on historical evidence but on assumptions of unobserved changes over thousands of years and assume stable genetic composition of the population living in a specific area, and are incapable of handling the contingencies that characterize every known historical process. Robert Hislope argues:\n:the articulation of cultural evolutionary theory represents theoretical progress over sociobiology, but its explanatory payoff remains limited due to the role of contingency in human affairs and the significance of non-evolutionary, proximate causal factors. While evolutionary theory undoubtedly elucidates the development of all organic life, it would seem to operate best at macro-levels of analysis, \"distal\" points of explanation, and from the perspective of the long-term. Hence, it is bound to display shortcomings at micro-level events that are highly contingent in nature.<ref>Robert Hislope \"From Ontology to Analogy: Evolutionary Theories and the Explanation of Ethnic Politics: in Patrick James and David Goetze ed.

This civic concept of nationalism is exemplified by [[Ernest Renan]] in his lecture in 1882 \"[[What is a Nation?]]\", where he defined the nation as a \"daily referendum\" (frequently translated \"daily [[plebiscite]]\") dependent on the will of its people to continue living together.<ref name=\"blackwell\"/>\n\nCivic nationalism is normally associated with [[liberal nationalism]], although the two are distinct, and did not always coincide. On the one hand, until the late 19th and early 20th century adherents to anti-Enlightenment movements such as French [[Legitimism]] or Spanish [[Carlism]] often rejected the liberal, national unitary state, yet identified themselves not with an ethnic nation but with a non-national dynasty and regional feudal privileges. Xenophobic movements in long-established Western European states indeed often took a 'civic national' form, rejecting a given group's ability to assimilate with the nation due to its belonging to a cross-border community (Irish Catholics in Britain, Ashkenazic Jews in France). On the other hand, while subnational separatist movements were commonly associated with ethnic nationalism, this was not always so, and such nationalists as the [[Corsican Republic]], [[United Irishmen]], [[Breton Federalist League]] or [[Catalan Republican Party]] could combine a rejection of the unitary civic-national state with a belief in liberal universalism.\n\nLiberal nationalism is kind of non-[[xenophobic]] nationalism that is claimed to be compatible with [[liberal values]] of [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], [[Toleration|tolerance]], [[Egalitarianism|equality]], and [[individual rights]].<ref>Tamir, Yael. 1993.

Civic nationalism is correlated with long-established states whose dynastic rulers had gradually acquired multiple distinct territories, with little change to boundaries, but which contained historical populations of multiple linguistic and/or confessional backgrounds. Since individuals resident within different parts of the state territory might have little obvious common ground, civic nationalism developed as a way for rulers to both explain a contemporary reason for such heterogeneity and to provide a common purpose  ([[Ernest Renan]]'s classic description in [[What is a Nation?]] (1882) as a voluntary partnership for a common endeavour).

She states:\n:Justifications of nationalism seem to be making a headway in political philosophy. Its proponents contend that liberalism and nationalism are not necessarily mutually exclusive and that they can in fact be made compatible. Liberal nationalists urge one to consider nationalism not as the pathology of modernity but as an answer to its malaise. For them, nationalism is more than an infantile disease, more than \"the measles of mankind\" as Einstein once proclaimed it to be. They argue that nationalism is a legitimate way of understanding one's role and place in life. They strive for a normative justification of nationalism which lies within liberal limits. The main claim which seems to be involved here is that as long as a nationalism abhors violence and propagates liberal rights and equal citizenship for all citizens of its state, its philosophical credentials can be considered to be sound.<ref>\nMonika Kirloskar-Steinbach, \"Liberal Nationalism-A Critique\" ''Trames'' 5#2 (June 2001) pp. 107\u201319 [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=qtr-VsOh6X8C&oi=fnd&pg=PA107&dq=%22Liberal+Nationalism-A+Critique%22&ots=p0eE4lJCRl&sig=xeAmTzl7O0L65Ybc3-Le0yis2l0#v=onepage&q=%22Liberal%20Nationalism-A%20Critique%22&f=false online]</ref>\n[[File:2012 UPA March in Kiev.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian nationalists carry portraits of [[Stepan Bandera]] and flags of the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]]]]\n\n===Creole nationalism===\n{{Main|Creole nationalism}}\n\"Creole nationalism\" refers to the ideology that emerged in independence movements among the creoles (descendants of the colonizers), especially in Latin America in the early 19th century.

[[Italian Fascism|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]], according to Alter and Brown, were examples of integral nationalism.\n\nSome of the qualities that characterize integral nationalism are [[anti-individualism]], [[statism]], radical extremism, and aggressive-expansionist militarism. The term Integral Nationalism often overlaps with fascism, although many natural points of disagreement exist. Integral nationalism arises in countries where a strong military ethos has become entrenched through the independence struggle, when, once independence is achieved, it is believed that a strong military is required to ensure the security and viability of the new state. Also, the success of such a liberation struggle results in feelings of national superiority that may lead to extreme nationalism.\n\nPan-nationalism is unique in that it covers a large area span. Pan-nationalism focuses more on \"clusters\" of ethnic groups. [[Pan-Slavism]] is one example of Pan-nationalism. The goal is to unite all [[Slavic people]] into one country.

The classic nationalist movements of the 19th century rejected the very existence of the multi-ethnic empires in Europe. However, even in that early stage there was an ideological critique of nationalism which has developed into several forms of [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] and anti-nationalism. The [[Islamic revival]] of the 20th century also produced an [[Islamism|Islamist]] critique of the nation-state. (see [[Pan-Islamism]])<ref>''[[World Book Encyclopedia]], 2018 ed., s.v. \"Muslims\"</ref>\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, [[Marxists]] and other [[socialists]] and [[communists]] (such as [[Rosa Luxemburg]]) produced political analysis that were critical of the nationalist movements then active in Central and Eastern Europe, although a variety of other contemporary socialists and communists, from [[Vladimir Lenin]] (a communist) to [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]] (a socialist), were more sympathetic to national [[self-determination]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1959/rosalux/6-natquest.htm |title=Rosa Luxemburg and the national question |accessdate=2 August 2008|last=Cliff |first=Tony |authorlink=Tony Cliff|year=1959|publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive]]}}</ref>\n\nIn his classic essay on the topic, [[George Orwell]] distinguishes nationalism from patriotism which he defines as devotion to a particular place.

When one grasps the implications of this, the nature of what I mean by nationalism becomes a good deal clearer. A nationalist is one who thinks solely, or mainly, in terms of competitive prestige. He may be a positive or a negative nationalist\u2014that is, he may use his mental energy either in boosting or in denigrating\u2014but at any rate his thoughts always turn on victories, defeats, triumphs and humiliations. He sees history, especially contemporary history, as the endless rise and decline of great power units and every event that happens seems to him a demonstration that his own side is on the upgrade and some hated rival is on the downgrade. But finally, it is important not to confuse nationalism with mere worship of success. The nationalist does not go on the principle of simply ganging up with the strongest side. On the contrary, having picked his side, he persuades himself that it is the strongest and is able to stick to his belief even when the facts are overwhelmingly against him.<ref name=NonN />}}\n\nIn the [[Liberalism|liberal]] political tradition there was mostly a negative attitude toward nationalism as a dangerous force and a cause of conflict and war between nation-states. The historian [[Lord Acton]] put the case against \"nationalism as insanity\" in 1862. He argued that nationalism suppresses minorities, it places country above moral principles and especially it creates a dangerous individual attachment to the state. However, Acton opposed democracy and was trying to defend the pope from Italian nationalism.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lang | first1 = Timothy | year = 2002 | title = Lord Acton and 'the Insanity of Nationality' | journal = Journal of the History of Ideas | volume = 63 | issue = 1| pages = 129\u201349 | jstor=3654261 | doi=10.2307/3654261}}</ref> Since the late 20th century, liberals have been increasingly divided, with some philosophers such as [[Michael Walzer]], [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] and [[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]] emphasizing that a liberal society needed to be based in a stable nation state.<ref>Motyl 1:298</ref>\n\nThe [[pacifist]] critique of nationalism also concentrates on the violence of nationalist movements, the associated [[militarism]], and on conflicts between nations inspired by [[jingoism]] or [[chauvinism]].

In 1793, that government declared a mass conscription (''lev\u00e9e en masse'') with a call to service:<blockquote>Henceforth, until the enemies have been driven from the territory of the Republic, all the French are in permanent requisition for army service.

Revanchism draws its strength from patriotic and retributionist thought and it is often motivated by economic or geo-political factors. Extreme revanchist ideologues often represent a hawkish stance, suggesting that their desired objectives can be achieved through the positive outcome of another war. It is linked with irredentism, the conception that a part of the cultural and ethnic nation remains \"unredeemed\" outside the borders of its appropriate nation state. Revanchist politics often rely on the identification of a nation with a nation state, often mobilizing deep-rooted sentiments of ethnic nationalism, claiming territories outside the state where members of the ethnic group live, while using heavy-handed nationalism to mobilize support for these aims. Revanchist justifications are often presented as based on ancient or even autochthonous occupation of a territory since \"time immemorial\", an assertion that is usually inextricably involved in revanchism and irredentism, justifying them in the eyes of their proponents.<ref>Karine Varley, \"The Taboos of Defeat: Unmentionable Memories of the Franco-Prussian War in France, 1870\u20131914.\" in Jenny Macleod, ed., ''Defeat and Memory: Cultural Histories of Military Defeat in the Modern Era'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2008) pp. 62\u201380.</ref>\n\nThe [[Dreyfus Affair]] in France 1894\u20131906 made the battle against treason and disloyalty a central theme for conservative Catholic French nationalists.

He idealized the Hohenzollern kings of Prussia.  His large-scale ''History of Prussian Politics'' (14 vol 1855\u20131886) was foundational for nationalistic students and scholars.

It was the political and intellectual movement that consolidated the different states of the [[Italian peninsula]] into the single state of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861. The memory of the ''Risorgimento'' is central to Italian nationalism but it was based in the liberal [[middle class]]es and ultimately proved weak.<ref>Silvana Patriarca and Lucy Riall, eds., ''The Risorgimento Revisited: Nationalism and Culture in Nineteenth-century Italy'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2011).</ref>   Two major groups remained opposed, \nthose from the [[Southern Italy|South or \"Mezzogiorno\"]] (formerly known as the [[Kingdom of the two Sicilies]]) and the devout Catholics. The new government treated the newly-annexed South as a conquered province with ridicule for its \"backward\" and poverty-stricken society, its poor grasp of standard Italian (as [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian]] dialects of [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] and [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] were prevalent in the common use) and its traditions. The liberals had always been strong opponents of the [[pope]] and the very well organized [[Catholic Church]]. The pope had been in political control of [[central Italy]]; he lost that in 1860 and Rome as well in 1870. He had long been the leader of opposition to modern liberalism and refused to accept the terms offered by the new Italian government. He called himself a \"prisoner\" in the Vatican and [[Non expedit|forbade Catholics]] to vote or engage in politics. The Catholic alienation lasted until 1929. The liberal government under the Sicilian [[Francesco Crispi]] sought to enlarge his political base by emulating [[Otto von Bismarck]] and firing up [[Italian nationalism]] with a hyper-aggressive foreign policy. It crashed and his cause was set back. Historian [[R. J. B. Bosworth|R.J.B. Bosworth]] says of his nationalistic foreign policy that:\n{{quote|(Crispi) pursued policies whose openly aggressive character would not be equaled until the days of the Fascist regime. Crispi increased military expenditure, talked cheerfully of a European conflagration, and alarmed his German or British friends with this suggestions of preventative attacks on his enemies.  His policies were ruinous, both for Italy's trade with France, and, more humiliatingly, for colonial ambitions in East Africa. Crispi's lust for territory there was thwarted when on 1 March 1896, the armies of Ethiopian Emperor Menelik routed Italian forces at [[Battle of Adwa|Adowa]] ... in what has been defined as an unparalleled disaster for a modern army.

Italy joined the [[Allies of World War I|Allies in the First World War]] after getting promises of territory, but its war effort was a fiasco that discredited liberalism and paved the way for [[Benito Mussolini]] and a political doctrine of his own creation, fascism. Mussolini's 20-year dictatorship involved a highly aggressive nationalism that led to a series of wars, an alliance with Hitler's Germany, and humiliation and hardship in the Second World War.

Large-scale nationalist revolts erupted [[November Uprising|in 1830]] and [[January Uprising|1863\u201364]] but were harshly crushed by Russia, which tried to make the [[Polish language]], [[Culture of Poland|culture]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|religion]] more like Russia's. The collapse of the Russian Empire in the First World War enabled the major powers to re-establish an independent Poland, which survived until 1939.  Meanwhile, Poles in areas controlled by Germany moved into heavy industry but their religion came under attack by Bismarck in the [[Kulturkampf]] of the 1870s.  The Poles joined German Catholics in a well-organized new [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], and defeated Bismarck politically.

This term originated from the word ''[[Zion]]'', which was one of the [[Torah]]'s names for the city of [[Jerusalem]]. The end goal of the nationalists and Zionists was a Jewish majority and in most cases, a state, in the [[Land of Israel|land of Palestine]]. A tumultuous history of living in oppressive, foreign, and uncertain circumstances led the supporters of the movement to draft a declaration of independence, claiming Israel as a birthplace. The first and second destructions of the temple and ancient Torah prophecies largely shaped the incentives of the Jewish nationalists. Many prominent theories in Jewish theology and eschatology were formed by supporters and opponents of the movement in this era.\n\nIt was the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, which sparked new waves of thinking across Europe regarding governance and sovereignty. A shift from the traditional hierarchy-based system towards political individualism and citizen-states posed a dilemma for the Jews. Citizenship was now essential, when it came to ensuring basic legal and residential rights. This resulted in more and more Jews choosing to identify with certain nationalities in order to maintain these rights. Logic said that a nation-based system of states  would require the Jews themselves to claim their own right to be considered a nation due to a distinguishable language and history. Historian David Engel has explained that Zionism was more about fear that a majority of worldwide Jews would end up dispersed and unprotected, rather than fulfilling old prophecies and traditions of historical texts.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Zionism|last=David|first=Engel|publisher=Pearson Longman Publishing Group|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n===20th century===\n\n====China====\n{{main|Chinese nationalism}}\nThe awakening of nationalism across Asia helped shape the history of the continent.

It promoted [[Culture of Greece|Greek traditions]], [[Greek folk music|folk music]] and [[Greek dances|dances]], [[classicism]] as well as [[medievalism]].\n\n====Africa====\n{{main|African nationalism|History of Africa}}\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-124-8.jpg|thumb|[[Kenneth Kaunda]], an anti-colonial political leader from [[Zambia]], pictured at a nationalist rally in colonial [[Northern Rhodesia]] (now [[Zambia]]) in 1960]]\n\nIn the 1880s the European powers divided up almost all of Africa (only [[Ethiopia]] and [[Liberia]] were independent). They ruled until after World War II when forces of nationalism grew much stronger.  In the 1950s and 1960s the colonial holdings became independent states. The process was usually peaceful but there were several long bitter bloody civil wars, as in Algeria,<ref>Alistair Horne, ''A savage war of peace: Algeria 1954\u20131962'' (1977).</ref> Kenya<ref>David Anderson, ''Histories of the hanged: The dirty war in Kenya and the end of empire'' (2005).</ref> and elsewhere.\nAcross Africa nationalism drew upon the organizational skills that natives learned in the British and French and other armies in the world wars. It led to organizations that were not controlled by or endorsed by either the colonial powers nor the traditional local power structures that were collaborating with the colonial powers. Nationalistic organizations began to challenge both the traditional and the new colonial structures and finally displaced them.  Leaders of nationalist movements took control when the European authorities exited; many ruled for decades or until they died off. These structures included political, educational, religious, and other social organizations. In recent decades, many African countries have undergone the triumph and defeat of nationalistic fervor, changing in the process the loci of the centralizing state power and patrimonial state.<ref>Gabriel Almond and James S. Coleman, ''The Politics of the Developing Areas'' (1971)</ref><ref>Festus Ugboaja Ohaegbulam, ''Nationalism in colonial and post-colonial Africa'' (University Press of America, 1977).</ref><ref>Thomas Hodgkin, ''Nationalism in Colonial Africa'' (1956)</ref>\n\n[[History of South Africa|South Africa]], a British colony, was exceptional in that it became virtually independent by 1931. From 1948 it was controlled by white [[Afrikaner]] nationalists focused on racial segregation and white minority rule known officially as [[apartheid]], which lasted until 1994, when [[1994 South African general election|elections]] were held. The black nationalist movement fought them until success was achieved and [[Nelson Mandela]] was elected President.<ref>Nancy L. Clark and William H. Worger, ''South Africa: The rise and fall of apartheid'' (Routledge, 2013).</ref>\n\n==== Middle East ====\n[[Arab nationalism]], a movement toward liberating and empowering the Arab peoples of the Middle East, emerged during the latter 19th century, inspired by other independence movements of the 18th and 19th centuries. As the [[Ottoman Empire]] declined and the Middle East was carved up by the Great Powers of Europe, Arabs sought to establish their own independent nations ruled by Arabs rather than foreigners. [[Syria]] was established in 1920; Transjordan (later [[Jordan]]) gradually gained independence between 1921 and 1946; [[Saudi Arabia]] was established in 1932; and [[Egypt]] achieved gradually gained independence between 1922 and 1952. The [[Arab League]] was established in 1945 to promote Arab interests and cooperation between the new Arab states.\n\nParallel to these efforts was the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]] which emerged among European Jews in the 19th century. Beginning in 1882 Jews, predominantly from Europe, began emigrating to [[Ottoman Palestine]] with the goal of establishing a new Jewish homeland. The effort culminated in the declaration of the [[State of Israel]] in 1948. As this move conflicted with the belief among Arab nationalists that Palestine was part of the Arab nation, the neighboring Arab nations [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War|launched an invasion]] to claim the region. The invasion was only partly successful and led to decades of clashes between the Arab and Jewish nationalist ideologies.\n\n==== Post-Communism ====\nThere was a rise in extreme nationalism after the [[Revolutions of 1989]] triggered the collapse of [[communism]] in the 1990s. When communism fell, it left many people with no identity. The people under communist rule had to integrate, and they found themselves free to choose. Given free choice, long dormant conflicts rose up and created sources of serious conflict.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Berg|first=Steven|date=1993|title=Nationalism Redux: Through the Glass of the Post-Communist States Darkly.|url=|journal=Ethnic Conflicts WorldWide, Current History|volume=|pages=162\u201366|via=}}</ref> When communism fell in Yugoslavia, serious conflict arose, which led to the rise in extreme nationalism.\n\nIn his 1992 article ''Jihad vs. McWorld,'' [[Benjamin Barber]] proposed that the fall of communism will cause large numbers of people to search for unity and that small scale wars will become common; groups will attempt to redraw boundaries, identities, cultures and ideologies.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Barber|first=Benjamin|date=1992|title=Jihad vs. McWorld: the two axial principles of our age\u2014tribalism and globalism\u2014clash at every point except one: they may both be threatening to democracy|url=|journal=The Atlantic|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Communism's fall also allowed for an  \"us vs. them\" mentality to sprout up.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Huntington|first=Samuel|date=1993|title=The Clash of Civilizations|url=|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=72|issue=3|pages=22\u201349|doi=10.2307/20045621|jstor=20045621}}</ref> Governments become vehicles for social interests and the country will attempt to form national policies based on the majority, for example culture, religion or ethnicity.<ref name=\":0\" /> Some newly sprouted democracies have large differences in policies on matters that ranged from immigration and human rights to trade and commerce.\n\nAcademic Steven Berg felt that at the root of nationalist conflicts is the demand for autonomy and a separate existence.<ref name=\":0\" /> This nationalism can give rise to strong emotions that may lead to a group fighting to survive, especially as after the fall of communism, political boundaries did not match ethnic boundaries.<ref name=\":0\" /> Serious conflicts often arose and escalated very easily as individuals and groups acted upon their beliefs, causing death and destruction.<ref name=\":0\" /> When this would happen, those states who were unable to contain the conflict ran the risk of slowing their democratization progress.\n\nYugoslavia was established after WWI and was a merger of three separate ethnic groups; Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.  The national census numbers for a ten-year span 1971\u20131981 measured an increase from 1.3 to 5.4% in their population that ethnically identified as Yugoslav.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Berg|first=Steven|date=2004|title=Why Yugoslavia Fell Apart|url=|journal=Current History|volume=92:577|pages=357\u201363|via=}}</ref> This meant that the country, almost as a whole, was divided by distinctive religious, ethnic or national loyalties after nearly 50 years.\n\nWithin Yugoslavia, separating Croatia and Slovenia from the rest of Yugoslavia is an invisible line of previous conquests of the region. Croatia and Slovenia to the northwest were conquered by Catholics or Protestants, and benefited from European history; the Renaissance, French Revolution, Industrial Revolution and are more inclined towards democracy.<ref name=\":2\" /> The remaining Yugoslavian territory was conquered by the Ottoman or Tsarists empires; are Orthodox or Muslims, are less economically advanced and are less inclined toward democracy.\n\nIn the 1970s the leadership of the separate territories within Yugoslavia protected only territorial interests at the expense of other territories. In Croatia, there was almost a split within the territory between Serbs and Croats so any political decision would kindle unrest, and tensions could cross the territories adjacent; Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref name=\":3\" /> Within Bosnia there was no group who had a majority; Muslim, Serb, Croat, and Yugoslav were all there so the leadership could not advance here either.  Political organizations were not able to deal successfully with such diverse nationalism. Within the territories the leadership could not compromise. To do so would create a winner in one ethnic group and a loser in another, raising the possibility of a serious conflict.  This strengthened the political stance promoting ethnic identities. This caused intense and divided political leadership within Yugoslavia.\n[[File:Cold War border changes.png|thumb|250px|[[List of national border changes since World War I|Changes in national boundaries]] in post-Soviet states after the collapse of communism followed by a resurgence of nationalism.]]\nIn the 1980s Yugoslavia began to break into fragments.<ref name=\":1\" /> The economic conditions within Yugoslavia were deteriorating. Conflict in the disputed territories was stimulated by the rise in mass nationalism and inter-ethnic hostilities.<ref name=\":3\" /> The per-capita income of people in the northwest territory, encompassing Croatia and Slovenia, in contrast to the southern territory were several times higher. This combined with escalating violence from ethnic Albanians and Serbs within Kosovo intensified economic conditions.<ref name=\":3\" /> This violence greatly contributed to the rise of extreme nationalism of Serbs in Serbia and within Yugoslavia. The ongoing conflict in Kosovo was propagandized by Communist Serbian Slobodan Milosevic to further increase Serb nationalism. As mentioned, this nationalism did give rise to powerful emotions which grew the force of Serbian nationalism through highly nationalist demonstrations in Vojvodina, Serbia, Montenegro, and Kosovo. Serbian nationalism was so high, Slobodan Milosevic was able to oust leaders in Vojvodina and Montenegro, further repressed Albanians within Kosovo and eventually controlled four of the eight regions/territories.<ref name=\":3\" /> Slovenia, one of the four regions not under Communist control, favoring a democratic state.\n\nWithin Slovenia, fear was mounting because Milosevic was using the militia to suppress a in Kosovo, what would he do to Slovenia.<ref name=\":3\" /> Half of Yugoslavia wanted to be democratic, the other wanted a new nationalist authoritarian regime. In fall of 1989 tensions came to a head and Slovenia asserted its political and economic independence from Yugoslavia and seceded. In January 1990, there was a total break with Serbia at the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, an institution conceived by Milosevic to strengthen unity and became the backdrop for the fall of communism within Yugoslavia.\n\nIn August 1990, a warning to the region was issued when ethnically divided groups attempted to alter the government structure. The republic borders established by the Communist regime in the postwar period were extremely vulnerable to challenges from ethnic communities.Ethnic communities arose because they did not share the identity with everyone within the new post-Communist borders.<ref name=\":3\" /> This threatened the new governments. The same disputes were erupting that were in place prior to Milosevic and were compounded by actions from his regime.\n\nAlso within the territory the Croats and the Serbs were in direct competition for control of government. Elections were held and increased potential conflicts between Serb and Croat nationalism. Serbia wanted to be separate and decide its own future based on its own ethnic composition. But this would then give Kosovo encouragement to become independent from Serbia. Albanians in Kosovo were already independent from Kosovo. Serbia didn't want to let Kosovo become independent. Muslims nationalists wanted their own territory but it would require a redrawing of the map, and would threaten neighboring territories. When communism fell in Yugoslavia, serious conflict arose, which led to the rise in extreme nationalism.\n\nNationalism again gave rise to powerful emotions which evoked in some extreme cases, a willingness to die for what you believe in, a fight for the survival of the group.<ref name=\":0\" /> The end of communism began a long period of conflict and war for the region. In the six years following the collapse 200,000-500-000 people died in the Bosnian war.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ramet|first=Sabrina|date=1996|title=Eastern Europe's Painful Transition|url=|journal=Current History|volume=|pages=97\u2013102|via=}}</ref> Bosnian Muslims suffered at the hands of the Serbs and Croats.<ref name=\":2\" /> The war garnered assistance from groups; Muslim, Orthodox and Western Christian as well as state actors who supplied all sides; Saudi Arabia and Iran supported Bosnia, Russia supported Serbia, Central European and Western countries including the U.S. supported Croatia, and the Pope supported Slovenia and Croatia.\n\n===21st century===\n{{main|Neo-nationalism}}\n\n[[Arab nationalism]] began to decline in the 21st century leading to localized nationalism, culminating in a series of revolts against authoritarian regimes between 2010 and 2012, known as the ''[[Arab Spring]]''. Following these revolts, which mostly failed to improve conditions in the affected nations, Arab nationalism and even most local nationalistic movements declined dramatically.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=What is the point of the Arab League? |date=29 April 2016 |magazine=The Economist |url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21698047-sad-decline-once-bold-organisation-what-point-arab-league}}</ref> A consequence of the [[Arab Spring]] as well as the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] were the [[Iraqi Civil War (2014\u20132017)|civil wars in Iraq]] and [[Syrian Civil War|Syria]], which eventually joined to form a [[Spillover of the Syrian Civil War|single conflict]].

Hayes]], [[Henry Maine]], [[Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]], [[Arnold Joseph Toynbee]] and [[Talcott Parsons]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=508\u201309}}\n\nHenry Maine in his analysis of the historical changes and development of human societies noted the key distinction between traditional societies defined as \"status\" societies based on family association and functionally diffuse roles for individuals; and modern societies defined as \"contract\" societies where social relations are determined by rational contracts pursued by individuals to advance their interests. Maine saw the development of societies as moving away from traditional status societies to modern contract societies.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\nFerdinand T\u00f6nnies in his book ''[[Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft]]'' (1887) defined a ''Gemeinschaft'' (community) as being based on emotional attachments as attributed with traditional societies, while defining a ''Gesellschaft'' (society) as an impersonal society that is modern. While he recognized the advantages of modern societies he also criticized them for their cold and impersonal nature that caused [[Social alienation|alienation]] while praising the intimacy of traditional communities.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\n\u00c9mile Durkheim expanded upon T\u00f6nnies' recognition of alienation, and defined the differences between traditional and modern societies as being between societies based upon \"mechanical solidarity\" versus societies based on \"organic solidarity\".{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}} Durkheim identified mechanical solidarity as involving custom, habit, and repression that was necessary to maintain shared views. Durkheim identified organic solidarity-based societies as modern societies where there exists a division of labour based on social differentiation that causes alienation. Durkheim claimed that social integration in traditional society required authoritarian culture involving acceptance of a social order. Durkheim claimed that modern society bases integration on the mutual benefits of the division of labour, but noted that the impersonal character of modern urban life caused alienation and feelings of [[anomie]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\nMax Weber claimed the change that developed modern society and nations is the result of the rise of a charismatic leader to power in a society who creates a new tradition or a rational-legal system that establishes the supreme authority of the state. Weber's conception of charismatic authority has been noted as the basis of many nationalist governments.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\n===Primordialist evolutionary interpretation===\nAnother approach emerging from biology and psychology looks at long-term evolutionary forces that might lead to nationalism.  The primordialist perspective is based upon evolutionary theory.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=272\u201373}}<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 4236409|title = Evolution, Mobility, and Ethnic Group Formation|journal = Politics and the Life Sciences|volume = 17|issue = 1|pages = 59\u201371|last1 = Goetze|first1 = David|year = 1998|doi = 10.1017/S0730938400025363}}</ref>\n\nThis approach has been popular with the general public but is typically rejected by experts.

Thinkers like [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Walter Bagehot]] reinterpreted Darwin's theory of natural selection \"often in ways inconsistent with Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution\" by making unsupported claims of biological difference among groups, ethnicities, races, and nations.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=495-496}} Modern evolutionary sciences have distanced themselves from such views, but notions of long-term evolutionary change remain foundational to the work of evolutionary psychologists like [[John Tooby]] and [[Leda Cosmides]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=268}}\n\nApproached through the primordialist perspective, the example of seeing the mobilization of a foreign military force on the nation's borders may provoke members of a national group to unify and mobilize themselves in response.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=271}} There are proximate environments where individuals identify nonimmediate real or imagined situations in combination with immediate situations that make individuals confront a common situation of both subjective and objective components that affect their decisions.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=272}} As such proximate environments cause people to make decisions based on existing situations and anticipated situations.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=272}}\n[[File:Maerz1848 berlin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Nationalist and liberal pressure led to the [[Revolutions of 1848|European revolutions of 1848]]]]\n\nCritics argue that primordial models relying on evolutionary psychology are based not on historical evidence but on assumptions of unobserved changes over thousands of years and assume stable genetic composition of the population living in a specific area, and are incapable of handling the contingencies that characterize every known historical process. Robert Hislope argues:\n:the articulation of cultural evolutionary theory represents theoretical progress over sociobiology, but its explanatory payoff remains limited due to the role of contingency in human affairs and the significance of non-evolutionary, proximate causal factors. While evolutionary theory undoubtedly elucidates the development of all organic life, it would seem to operate best at macro-levels of analysis, \"distal\" points of explanation, and from the perspective of the long-term. Hence, it is bound to display shortcomings at micro-level events that are highly contingent in nature.<ref>Robert Hislope \"From Ontology to Analogy: Evolutionary Theories and the Explanation of Ethnic Politics: in Patrick James and David Goetze ed.

This civic concept of nationalism is exemplified by [[Ernest Renan]] in his lecture in 1882 \"[[What is a Nation?]]\", where he defined the nation as a \"daily referendum\" (frequently translated \"daily [[plebiscite]]\") dependent on the will of its people to continue living together.<ref name=\"blackwell\"/>\n\nCivic nationalism is normally associated with [[liberal nationalism]], although the two are distinct, and did not always coincide. On the one hand, until the late 19th and early 20th century adherents to anti-Enlightenment movements such as French [[Legitimism]] or Spanish [[Carlism]] often rejected the liberal, national unitary state, yet identified themselves not with an ethnic nation but with a non-national dynasty and regional feudal privileges. Xenophobic movements in long-established Western European states indeed often took a 'civic national' form, rejecting a given group's ability to assimilate with the nation due to its belonging to a cross-border community (Irish Catholics in Britain, Ashkenazic Jews in France). On the other hand, while subnational separatist movements were commonly associated with ethnic nationalism, this was not always so, and such nationalists as the [[Corsican Republic]], [[United Irishmen]], [[Breton Federalist League]] or [[Catalan Republican Party]] could combine a rejection of the unitary civic-national state with a belief in liberal universalism.\n\nLiberal nationalism is kind of non-[[xenophobic]] nationalism that is claimed to be compatible with [[liberal values]] of [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], [[Toleration|tolerance]], [[Egalitarianism|equality]], and [[individual rights]].<ref>Tamir, Yael. 1993.

Civic nationalism is correlated with long-established states whose dynastic rulers had gradually acquired multiple distinct territories, with little change to boundaries, but which contained historical populations of multiple linguistic and/or confessional backgrounds. Since individuals resident within different parts of the state territory might have little obvious common ground, civic nationalism developed as a way for rulers to both explain a contemporary reason for such heterogeneity and to provide a common purpose  ([[Ernest Renan]]'s classic description in [[What is a Nation?]] (1882) as a voluntary partnership for a common endeavour).

She states:\n:Justifications of nationalism seem to be making a headway in political philosophy. Its proponents contend that liberalism and nationalism are not necessarily mutually exclusive and that they can in fact be made compatible. Liberal nationalists urge one to consider nationalism not as the pathology of modernity but as an answer to its malaise. For them, nationalism is more than an infantile disease, more than \"the measles of mankind\" as Einstein once proclaimed it to be. They argue that nationalism is a legitimate way of understanding one's role and place in life. They strive for a normative justification of nationalism which lies within liberal limits. The main claim which seems to be involved here is that as long as a nationalism abhors violence and propagates liberal rights and equal citizenship for all citizens of its state, its philosophical credentials can be considered to be sound.<ref>\nMonika Kirloskar-Steinbach, \"Liberal Nationalism-A Critique\" ''Trames'' 5#2 (June 2001) pp. 107\u201319 [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=qtr-VsOh6X8C&oi=fnd&pg=PA107&dq=%22Liberal+Nationalism-A+Critique%22&ots=p0eE4lJCRl&sig=xeAmTzl7O0L65Ybc3-Le0yis2l0#v=onepage&q=%22Liberal%20Nationalism-A%20Critique%22&f=false online]</ref>\n[[File:2012 UPA March in Kiev.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian nationalists carry portraits of [[Stepan Bandera]] and flags of the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]]]]\n\n===Creole nationalism===\n{{Main|Creole nationalism}}\n\"Creole nationalism\" refers to the ideology that emerged in independence movements among the creoles (descendants of the colonizers), especially in Latin America in the early 19th century.

[[Italian Fascism|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]], according to Alter and Brown, were examples of integral nationalism.\n\nSome of the qualities that characterize integral nationalism are [[anti-individualism]], [[statism]], radical extremism, and aggressive-expansionist militarism. The term Integral Nationalism often overlaps with fascism, although many natural points of disagreement exist. Integral nationalism arises in countries where a strong military ethos has become entrenched through the independence struggle, when, once independence is achieved, it is believed that a strong military is required to ensure the security and viability of the new state. Also, the success of such a liberation struggle results in feelings of national superiority that may lead to extreme nationalism.\n\nPan-nationalism is unique in that it covers a large area span. Pan-nationalism focuses more on \"clusters\" of ethnic groups. [[Pan-Slavism]] is one example of Pan-nationalism. The goal is to unite all [[Slavic people]] into one country.

The classic nationalist movements of the 19th century rejected the very existence of the multi-ethnic empires in Europe. However, even in that early stage there was an ideological critique of nationalism which has developed into several forms of [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] and anti-nationalism. The [[Islamic revival]] of the 20th century also produced an [[Islamism|Islamist]] critique of the nation-state. (see [[Pan-Islamism]])<ref>''[[World Book Encyclopedia]], 2018 ed., s.v. \"Muslims\"</ref>\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, [[Marxists]] and other [[socialists]] and [[communists]] (such as [[Rosa Luxemburg]]) produced political analysis that were critical of the nationalist movements then active in Central and Eastern Europe, although a variety of other contemporary socialists and communists, from [[Vladimir Lenin]] (a communist) to [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]] (a socialist), were more sympathetic to national [[self-determination]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1959/rosalux/6-natquest.htm |title=Rosa Luxemburg and the national question |accessdate=2008-08-02|last=Cliff |first=Tony |authorlink=Tony Cliff|year=1959|publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive]]}}</ref>\n\nIn his classic essay on the topic, [[George Orwell]] distinguishes nationalism from patriotism which he defines as devotion to a particular place.

When one grasps the implications of this, the nature of what I mean by nationalism becomes a good deal clearer. A nationalist is one who thinks solely, or mainly, in terms of competitive prestige. He may be a positive or a negative nationalist\u2014that is, he may use his mental energy either in boosting or in denigrating\u2014but at any rate his thoughts always turn on victories, defeats, triumphs and humiliations. He sees history, especially contemporary history, as the endless rise and decline of great power units and every event that happens seems to him a demonstration that his own side is on the upgrade and some hated rival is on the downgrade. But finally, it is important not to confuse nationalism with mere worship of success. The nationalist does not go on the principle of simply ganging up with the strongest side. On the contrary, having picked his side, he persuades himself that it is the strongest and is able to stick to his belief even when the facts are overwhelmingly against him.<ref name=NonN />}}\n\nIn the [[Liberalism|liberal]] political tradition there was mostly a negative attitude toward nationalism as a dangerous force and a cause of conflict and war between nation-states. The historian [[Lord Acton]] put the case against \"nationalism as insanity\" in 1862. He argued that nationalism suppresses minorities, it places country above moral principles and especially it creates a dangerous individual attachment to the state. However, Acton opposed democracy and was trying to defend the pope from Italian nationalism.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lang | first1 = Timothy | year = 2002 | title = Lord Acton and 'the Insanity of Nationality' | journal = Journal of the History of Ideas | volume = 63 | issue = 1| pages = 129\u201349 | jstor=3654261 | doi=10.2307/3654261}}</ref> Since the late 20th century, liberals have been increasingly divided, with some philosophers such as [[Michael Walzer]], [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] and [[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]] emphasizing that a liberal society needed to be based in a stable nation state.<ref>Motyl 1:298</ref>\n\nThe [[pacifist]] critique of nationalism also concentrates on the violence of nationalist movements, the associated [[militarism]], and on conflicts between nations inspired by [[jingoism]] or [[chauvinism]].

He was a member of the [[Italian Communist Party]] from 1974 to 1984.\n\nRampini is married to Stefania, with whom he has two children, actor Jacopo Rampini and Costanza Rampini a university professor.  He has lived in the United States since 2000, and became a US citizen in 2014.<ref name=\"Federico Rampini\"/>\n\n==Career==\nRampini\u2019s activity as a journalist began in 1977 in \"Citt\u00e0 futura\", a weekly magazine of the [[Italian Communist Youth Federation]] (FGCI) whose secretary at the time was [[Massimo D\u2019Alema]]. From 1979 to 1982 he worked as the economic-union editor for the PCI weekly [[Rinascita]]. In 1982 Rampini moved to '' Mondo Economico '' (weekly of [[Il Sole 24 Ore]]) then to '' [[L'Espresso]] '' (1982-1986). Rampini worked for '' [[Il Sole 24 Ore]] '' as correspondent from [[France]] for five years (1986-1991) and later as deputy director (1991-1995). Since 1995 he has been working for ''[[La Repubblica]]'', first at the head of the Milanese editorial staff, then as foreign correspondent from [[Brussels]] (1997-2000), [[San Francisco]] (2000-2004), [[Beijing]] (2004-2009), and since 2009 from [[New York City|New York]]. Rampini often reports on top-level international summits such as the [[G8|G-8]],[[G-20]], and the [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos]]; he also reports from the [[White House]] as he holds press accreditation from the Presidency of the [[United States of America]].\n\nRampini, who is a prolific non-fiction writer and essayist, has written over 30 books, most of which are published by [[Mondadori]] and have been translated into several languages. In 2005, his book [[Il Secolo Cinese]] -\"The Chinese Century\", topped the Italian bestseller charts in non-fiction for several months and is now in its sixteenth edition. His 2006 book [[L'Impero di Cindia]] - \"The Chindia Empire: China, India and Their Surroundings\" ([[Mondadori]]), sold over 100,000 copies.\n\nRampini was named among the fifty most influential personalities in Europe in 2005 by the European Voice poll ''EV50''. He has been a visiting professor at the [[University of California Berkeley]] School of Journalism, [[Bocconi]] University in Milan, and at the [[Shanghai University]] of Economics and Finance.\n\nRampini was accused in early 2015, among others by translator Marion Sarah Tuggey, of having based his articles and essays on translations and reductions of articles and reports from newspapers such as the [[New York Times]] and the [[Financial Times]]. Among these, an interview with [[Vandana Shiva]], which would have been produced through partial translation and readjustment of a blog post on Shiva's website.<ref>[http://vandanashiva.com/?p=105 Vandana Shiva] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910051019/http://vandanashiva.com/?p=105 |date=10 settembre 2015 }}, 26 agosto 2014; [http://www.repubblica.it/ambiente/2014/10/03/news/intervista_vandana_shiva_ogm-97215746/ Repubblica], 3 ottobre 2014</ref><ref name=\"Libernazione\">[http://libernazione.it/shiva-e-rampini-cosa-aspettarsi-mai/ Luca Mazzone] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820170154/http://libernazione.it/shiva-e-rampini-cosa-aspettarsi-mai/ |date=20 agosto 2016 }}, 3 ottobre 2014</ref> \nTo illustrate such cases of plagiarism, Tuggey and others used the hashtag #rampinomics.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/grande-firma-repubblica-contagiata-virus-copia-e-incolla-1102996.html|title = La grande firma di \"Repubblica\" contagiata dal virus del copia e incolla|date = 4 January 2016}}</ref><ref>[http://www.liberoquotidiano.it/news/personaggi/11755681/Federico-Rampini-sbugiardato-da-una-donna.html Libero], 12 febbraio 2015</ref><ref>[http://www.italiaoggi.it/giornali/dettaglio_giornali.asp?preview=false&accessMode=FA&id=1961481&codiciTestate=1 Italia Oggi], 12 febbraio 2015</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n* [[Premio Acqui Storia]] , ''2005''\n* [[Premio Luigi Barzini]] , ''2005''\n* [[Premio Saint Vincent]], ''2006''\n* [[Premio Hemingway]] (2019)<ref name=\"hemingwayaward\" />\n\n==Books==\n{{div col}}\n* ''La comunicazione aziendale.

He would also attend seminars of the French liberal sociologist [[Raymond Aron]] at the ''[[\u00c9cole pratique des hautes \u00e9tudes]]'' in Paris. He was a member of the [[Italian Communist Party]] from 1974 to 1984.\n\nRampini is married to Stefania, with whom he has two children, actor Jacopo Rampini and Costanza Rampini a university professor.  He has lived in the United States since 2000, and became a US citizen in 2014.<ref name=\"Federico Rampini\"/>\n\n==Career==\nRampini\u2019s activity as a journalist began in 1977 in \"Citt\u00e0 futura\", a weekly magazine of the [[Italian Communist Youth Federation]] (FGCI) whose secretary at the time was [[Massimo D\u2019Alema]]. From 1979 to 1982 he worked as the economic-union editor for the PCI weekly [[Rinascita]]. In 1982 Rampini moved to '' Mondo Economico '' (weekly of [[Il Sole 24 Ore]]) then to '' [[L'Espresso]] '' (1982-1986). Rampini worked for '' [[Il Sole 24 Ore]] '' as correspondent from [[France]] for five years (1986-1991) and later as deputy director (1991-1995). Since 1995 he has been working for ''[[La Repubblica]]'', first at the head of the Milanese editorial staff, then as foreign correspondent from [[Brussels]] (1997-2000), [[San Francisco]] (2000-2004), [[Beijing]] (2004-2009), and since 2009 from [[New York City|New York]]. Rampini often reports on top-level international summits such as the [[G8|G-8]],[[G-20]], and the [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos]]; he also reports from the [[White House]] as he holds press accreditation from the Presidency of the [[United States of America]].\n\nRampini, who is a prolific non-fiction writer and essayist, has written over 30 books, most of which are published by [[Mondadori]] and have been translated into several languages. In 2005, his book [[Il Secolo Cinese]] -\"The Chinese Century\", topped the Italian bestseller charts in non-fiction for several months and is now in its sixteenth edition. His 2006 book [[L'Impero di Cindia]] - \"The Chindia Empire: China, India and Their Surroundings\" ([[Mondadori]]), sold over 100,000 copies.\n\nRampini was named among the fifty most influential personalities in Europe in 2005 by the European Voice poll ''EV50''. He has been a visiting professor at the [[University of California Berkeley]] School of Journalism, [[Bocconi]] University in Milan, and at the [[Shanghai University]] of Economics and Finance.\n\nRampini was accused in early 2015, among others by translator Marion Sarah Tuggey, of having based his articles and essays on translations and reductions of articles and reports from newspapers such as the [[New York Times]] and the [[Financial Times]]. Among these, an interview with [[Vandana Shiva]], which would have been produced through partial translation and readjustment of a blog post on Shiva's website.<ref>[http://vandanashiva.com/?p=105 Vandana Shiva] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910051019/http://vandanashiva.com/?p=105 |date=10 settembre 2015 }}, 26 agosto 2014; [http://www.repubblica.it/ambiente/2014/10/03/news/intervista_vandana_shiva_ogm-97215746/ Repubblica], 3 ottobre 2014</ref><ref name=\"Libernazione\">[http://libernazione.it/shiva-e-rampini-cosa-aspettarsi-mai/ Luca Mazzone] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820170154/http://libernazione.it/shiva-e-rampini-cosa-aspettarsi-mai/ |date=20 agosto 2016 }}, 3 ottobre 2014</ref> \nTo illustrate such cases of plagiarism, Tuggey and others used the hashtag #rampinomics. <ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/grande-firma-repubblica-contagiata-virus-copia-e-incolla-1102996.html|title = La grande firma di \"Repubblica\" contagiata dal virus del copia e incolla|date = 4 January 2016}}</ref><ref>[http://www.liberoquotidiano.it/news/personaggi/11755681/Federico-Rampini-sbugiardato-da-una-donna.html Libero], 12 febbraio 2015</ref><ref>[http://www.italiaoggi.it/giornali/dettaglio_giornali.asp?preview=false&accessMode=FA&id=1961481&codiciTestate=1 Italia Oggi], 12 febbraio 2015</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n* [[Premio Acqui Storia]] , ''2005''\n* [[Premio Luigi Barzini]] , ''2005''\n* [[Premio Saint Vincent]], ''2006''\n* [[Premio Hemingway]] (2019)<ref name=\"hemingwayaward\" />\n\n==Books==\n{{div col}}\n* ''La comunicazione aziendale.

His views and writings were subsequently used to back-up the claims of those that proposed a man-made origin for the virus, and in [[Propaganda in the Soviet Union|Soviet propaganda]] against the United States. A collection of papers relating to Seale's views on HIV are held by the [[Wellcome Collection]].\n\n==Early life and family==\nJohn Seale was born in Exeter in 1927.

He was elected to the Fellowship's executive in 1962.<ref name=cow/> His writings in support of the FFM's perspective included an article on \"The Supply of Doctors\" in the ''British Medical Journal'' in 1961 and another in 1964 in that journal on the rate of medical emigration from Britain and Ireland.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Seale | first1 = John R | year = 1964 | title = Medical Emigration from Great Britain and Ireland | url = https://www.bmj.com/content/1/5391/1173 | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 1 | issue = 5391| pages = 1173\u201378 }}</ref> He identified migration of British doctors to countries such as Canada due to poor employment conditions in the NHS and migration to Britain of doctors from Asia whose training and English language skills he questioned, adding a racial component to the class-based and economic opposition of some British doctors to the imposition of the NHS system on them by the British government. Much of the migration from Britain was of [[general practitioner]]s in what was seen in the 1960s as a crisis in general practice.
