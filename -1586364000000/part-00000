The size and the scale of the escort depends on the deployments and the task that the carrier is involved in. If it is a NATO tasking in the North Atlantic, for example, you would expect an international contribution to those types of taskings, in the same way as we sometimes escort the French carrier or American carriers to make up that. It is definitely our intention, though, that the carrier strike group will be able to be a wholly UK sovereign deployable group. Now, it is probably not necessary to do that every single time we do it, depending on the tasking, but we want to do that and test doing it. Once we have done that, depending on the deployment, of course, we will cut our cloth as required. The escorts that go with the carrier will depend on the circumstances.\n\n2021 will be the first major operational deployment of [[ HMS Queen Elizabeth (R08)|HMS ''Queen Elizabeth'']]. The work-up for carrier strike group 21 will be with British ships, because we need to demonstrate and prove that we can do that, but we are already engaged with international partners to understand how we will integrate an Arleigh Burke destroyer from the US or a Dutch destroyer into that package. HMS Queen Elizabeth will be escorted by two [[Type 45 destroyer|Type 45 destroyer's]], two [[Type 23 frigate|Type 23 frigate's]], a nuclear submarine, a [[Tide-class tanker|Tide-class tanker]] and [[RFA Fort Victoria (A387)|RFA ''Fort Victoria'']].

The size and the scale of the escort depends on the deployments and the task that the carrier is involved in. If it is a NATO tasking in the North Atlantic, for example, you would expect an international contribution to those types of taskings, in the same way as we sometimes escort the French carrier or American carriers to make up that. It is definitely our intention, though, that the carrier strike group will be able to be a wholly UK sovereign deployable group. Now, it is probably not necessary to do that every single time we do it, depending on the tasking, but we want to do that and test doing it. Once we have done that, depending on the deployment, of course, we will cut our cloth as required. The escorts that go with the carrier will depend on the circumstances.\n\n2021 will be the first major operational deployment of [[ HMS Queen Elizabeth (R08)|HMS ''Queen Elizabeth'']]. The work-up for carrier strike group 21 will be with British ships, because we need to demonstrate and prove that we can do that, but we are already engaged with international partners to understand how we will integrate an Arleigh Burke destroyer from the US or a Dutch destroyer into that package. HMS Queen Elizabeth will be escorted by two [[Type 45 destroyer|Type 45 destroyer's]], two [[Type 23 frigate|Type 23 frigate's]], a nuclear submarine, a [[Tide-class tanker|Tide-class tanker]] and [[RFA Fort Victoria (A387)|RFA ''Fort Victoria'']].

He played 18 seasons in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) and was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] as a player in 2018.\n\nAllen played college basketball for the [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|Connecticut Huskies]] for three seasons, gaining a reputation as an efficient long-range shooter. He entered the NBA in [[1996 NBA Draft|1996]] as the fifth overall selection. In the NBA, he developed into a prolific scorer for the [[Milwaukee Bucks]], featuring alongside [[Glenn Robinson]] and [[Sam Cassell]] as the team achieved playoff success. However, the trio were unable to capture a championship, and Allen was traded to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]]. In Seattle, Allen's reputation as a scorer was solidified; he would break several league records for [[Three-point field goal|three-point]] and [[free throw]] shooting. Despite this, a title still eluded Allen, and he was traded to the [[Boston Celtics]] in 2007.\n\nIn Boston, Allen and new teammates [[Kevin Garnett]] and [[Paul Pierce]] formed a \"Big Three\" and had immediate success, winning an [[List of NBA champions|NBA championship]] in [[2008 NBA Finals|2008]]. He remained with the franchise for five seasons, before departing in free agency to join the [[Miami Heat]] for two seasons. In Miami, Allen accepted a reserve role, emphasizing spot-up and clutch shooting, which allowed him to capture another championship in [[2013 NBA Finals|2013]]. His clutch three-pointer to tie Game 6 of the 2013 NBA Finals with 5.2 seconds remaining is regarded as one of the most memorable plays in NBA history.\n\nAllen's list of individual accolades are extensive; he gained ten [[NBA All-Star Game|NBA All-Star]] designations, he won an [[gold medal|Olympic gold medal]] as a member of the [[USA men's national basketball team#2000 Olympics U.S. Men's Basketball Team|2000 United States men's basketball team]], and he also holds NBA records in career three-point field goals made in both the [[List of National Basketball Association career 3-point scoring leaders|regular]] and [[List of National Basketball Association career playoff 3-point scoring leaders|postseason]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Young |first=Royce |title=Ray Allen breaks all-time playoff 3-point record |url=http://www.cbssports.com/nba/blog/eye-on-basketball/22139764/video-ray-allen-breaks-all-time-playoff-3-point-record |work=CBSSPORTS}}</ref> He is also considered one of the best shooters of all-time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/ft_pct_career.html |title=NBA & ABA Career Leaders and Records for Free Throw Pct |accessdate=June 10, 2010 |publisher=Sports Reference LLC.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/fg3_pct_career.html |title=NBA & ABA Career Leaders and Records for 3-Pt Field Goal Pct |accessdate=June 10, 2010 |publisher=Sports Reference LLC.}}</ref> In September 2018, he was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]].\n\nDuring his NBA career, Allen acted during some offseasons.

When he first arrived, the young Allen was often made the odd-man-out, whom kids often picked on, due to the accent acquired during his formative years in Britain. Although never completely fitting in with the other kids, Allen's natural athletic gifts, and his obsession with hard work, allowed him to excel in every sport he played. When a growth spurt left him with a natural advantage in basketball, he decided to dedicate his free time to becoming the best basketball player he possibly could.<ref name=\"theplayerstribune.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theplayerstribune.com/ray-allen-letter-to-my-younger-self/|title=Letter to My Younger Self \u2013 By Ray Allen|website=The Players' Tribune}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/Allen/Allen_bio.html|title=JockBio: Ray Allen Biography|website=www.jockbio.com}}</ref> Fueled by his desire to become the top player on the military base where he lived, Allen practiced at length daily, so long as it didn't interfere with his studies.<ref name=\"theplayerstribune.com\"/> By the age of fifteen, he was playing for Hillcrest High School's varsity team, and would eventually lead them to their first state championship game. In that game, Allen showed his NBA potential by posting an impressive 25 points, to go along with 12 rebounds, in a blowout victory for Hillcrest Wildcats. Amid the resulting attention from colleges, especially from the [[University of Kentucky]], Allen ultimately accepted an offer from the [[University of Connecticut]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kentuckysportsradio.com/basketball-2/ray-allen-explains-why-he-picked-uconn-over-uk-in-93/|title=Ray Allen explains why he picked UConn over UK in \u201992 \u2013 Kentucky Sports Radio|website=kentuckysportsradio.com}}</ref>\n\n==College career==\nAllen attended the [[University of Connecticut]] from 1993 to 1996 after being recruited by assistant coach [[Karl Hobbs]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gwsports.com/sports/m-baskbl/mtt/hobbs_karl00.html |title=Player Bio: Karl Hobbs \u2013 George Washington University Official Athletic Site |publisher=Gwsports.com |date=May 7, 2001 |accessdate=March 29, 2012}}</ref> While at UConn, he was named USA Basketball's Male Athlete of the Year in 1995.

July 20, 1975) is an American former professional [[basketball]] player. He played 18 seasons in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) and was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] as a player in 2018.\n\nAllen played college basketball for the [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|Connecticut Huskies]] for three seasons, gaining a reputation as an efficient long-range shooter. He entered the NBA in [[1996 NBA Draft|1996]] as the fifth overall selection. In the NBA, he developed into a prolific scorer for the [[Milwaukee Bucks]], featuring alongside [[Glenn Robinson]] and [[Sam Cassell]] as the team achieved playoff success. However, the trio were unable to capture a championship, and Allen was traded to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]]. In Seattle, Allen's reputation as a scorer was solidified; he would break several league records for [[Three-point field goal|three-point]] and [[free throw]] shooting. Despite this, a title still eluded Allen, and he was traded to the [[Boston Celtics]] in 2007.\n\nIn Boston, Allen and new teammates [[Kevin Garnett]] and [[Paul Pierce]] formed a \"Big Three\" and had immediate success, winning an [[List of NBA champions|NBA championship]] in [[2008 NBA Finals|2008]]. He remained with the franchise for five seasons, before departing in free agency to join the [[Miami Heat]] for two seasons. In Miami, Allen accepted a reserve role, emphasizing spot-up and clutch shooting, which allowed him to capture another championship in [[2013 NBA Finals|2013]]. His clutch three-pointer to tie Game 6 of the 2013 NBA Finals with 5.2 seconds remaining is regarded as one of the most memorable plays in NBA history.\n\nAllen's list of individual accolades are extensive; he gained ten [[NBA All-Star Game|NBA All-Star]] designations, he won an [[gold medal|Olympic gold medal]] as a member of the [[USA men's national basketball team#2000 Olympics U.S. Men's Basketball Team|2000 United States men's basketball team]], and he also holds NBA records in career three-point field goals made in both the [[List of National Basketball Association career 3-point scoring leaders|regular]] and [[List of National Basketball Association career playoff 3-point scoring leaders|postseason]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Young |first=Royce |title=Ray Allen breaks all-time playoff 3-point record |url=http://www.cbssports.com/nba/blog/eye-on-basketball/22139764/video-ray-allen-breaks-all-time-playoff-3-point-record |work=CBSSPORTS}}</ref> He is also considered one of the best shooters of all-time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/ft_pct_career.html |title=NBA & ABA Career Leaders and Records for Free Throw Pct |accessdate=June 10, 2010 |publisher=Sports Reference LLC.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/fg3_pct_career.html |title=NBA & ABA Career Leaders and Records for 3-Pt Field Goal Pct |accessdate=June 10, 2010 |publisher=Sports Reference LLC.}}</ref> In September 2018, he was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]].\n\nDuring his NBA career, Allen acted during some offseasons.

Although never completely fitting in with the other kids, Allen's natural athletic gifts, and his obsession with hard work, allowed him to excel in every sport he played.
