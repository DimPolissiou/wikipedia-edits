The approval was based on the pivotal study E4599 (conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group), which demonstrated a two-month improvement in overall survival in patients treated with bevacizumab (Sandler, et al. NEJM 2004). A preplanned analysis of histology in E4599 demonstrated a four-month median survival benefit with bevacizumab for people with adenocarcinoma (Sandler, et al. JTO 2010); adenocarcinoma represents approximately 85% of all non-squamous cell carcinomas of the lung.\n\nA subsequent European clinical trial, AVAiL, was first reported in 2009 and confirmed the significant improvement in progression-free survival shown in E4599 (Reck, et al. Ann. Oncol. 2010). An overall survival benefit was not demonstrated in patients treated with bevacizumab; however, this may be due to the more limited use of bevacizumab as maintenance treatment in AVAiL versus E4599 (this differential effect is also apparent in the European vs US trials of bevacizumab in colorectal cancer: Tyagi and Grothey, Clin Colorectal Cancer, 2006). As an anti-angiogenic agent, there is no mechanistic rationale for stopping bevacizumab before disease progression. Stated another way, the survival benefits achieved with bevacizumab can only be expected when used in accordance with the clinical evidence: continued until disease progression or treatment-limiting side effects.\n\nAnother large European-based clinical trial with bevacizumab in lung cancer, AVAPERL, was reported in October 2011 (Barlesi, et al. ECCM 2011). First-line patients were treated with bevacizumab plus cisplatin/pemetrexed for four cycles, and then randomized to receive maintenance treatment with either bevacizumab/pemetrexed or bevacizumab alone until disease progression. Maintenance treatment with bevacizumab/pemetrexed demonstrated a 50% reduction in risk of progression vs bevacizumab alone (median PFS: 10.2 vs 6.6 months). Maintenance treatment with bevacizumab/pemetrexed did not confer a significant increase in overall survival vs bevacizumab alone on follow up analysis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Barlesi F, Scherpereel A, Gorbunova V, Gervais R, Vikstr\u00f6m A, Chouaid C, Chella A, Kim JH, Ahn MJ, Reck M, Pazzola A, Kim HT, Aerts JG, Morando C, Loundou A, Groen HJ, Rittmeyer A | title = Maintenance bevacizumab-pemetrexed after first-line cisplatin-pemetrexed-bevacizumab for advanced nonsquamous nonsmall-cell lung cancer: updated survival analysis of the AVAPERL (MO22089) randomized phase III trial | journal = Annals of Oncology | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 1044\u201352 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24585722 | doi = 10.1093/annonc/mdu098 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\nThe National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends bevacizumab as standard first-line treatment in combination with any platinum-based chemotherapy, followed by maintenance bevacizumab until disease progression.{{mcn|date=March 2020}} Higher doses are usually given with carboplatin-based chemotherapy, whereas the lower dose is usually given with cisplatin-based chemotherapy.{{mcn|date=March 2020}}\n\n=== Breast cancer ===\nIn December 2010, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) notified its intention to remove the breast cancer indication (approved in 2008) from bevacizumab, saying that it had not been shown to be safe and effective in [[breast cancer]] patients. The combined data from four different clinical trials showed that bevacizumab neither prolonged overall survival nor slowed disease progression sufficiently to outweigh the risk it presents to patients. This only prevented Genentech from marketing bevacizumab for breast cancer.

The data from two large randomized studies showed no benefit in preventing the cancer from returning and a potential to cause harm in this setting.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Van Cutsem E, Lambrechts D, Prenen H, Jain RK, Carmeliet P | title = Lessons from the adjuvant bevacizumab trial on colon cancer: what next? | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u20134 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21115866 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2010.32.2701 | df =  }}</ref>\n\n=== Lung cancer ===\nIn 2006, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved bevacizumab for use in first-line advanced nonsquamous [[Non-small-cell lung carcinoma|non-small cell lung cancer]] in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy. The approval was based on the pivotal study E4599 (conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group), which demonstrated a two-month improvement in overall survival in patients treated with bevacizumab (Sandler, et al. NEJM 2004). A preplanned analysis of histology in E4599 demonstrated a four-month median survival benefit with bevacizumab for people with adenocarcinoma (Sandler, et al. JTO 2010); adenocarcinoma represents approximately 85% of all non-squamous cell carcinomas of the lung.\n\nA subsequent European clinical trial, AVAiL, was first reported in 2009 and confirmed the significant improvement in progression-free survival shown in E4599 (Reck, et al. Ann. Oncol. 2010). An overall survival benefit was not demonstrated in patients treated with bevacizumab; however, this may be due to the more limited use of bevacizumab as maintenance treatment in AVAiL versus E4599 (this differential effect is also apparent in the European vs US trials of bevacizumab in colorectal cancer: Tyagi and Grothey, Clin Colorectal Cancer, 2006). As an anti-angiogenic agent, there is no mechanistic rationale for stopping bevacizumab before disease progression. Stated another way, the survival benefits achieved with bevacizumab can only be expected when used in accordance with the clinical evidence: continued until disease progression or treatment-limiting side effects.\n\nAnother large European-based clinical trial with bevacizumab in lung cancer, AVAPERL, was reported in October 2011 (Barlesi, et al. ECCM 2011). First-line patients were treated with bevacizumab plus cisplatin/pemetrexed for four cycles, and then randomized to receive maintenance treatment with either bevacizumab/pemetrexed or bevacizumab alone until disease progression. Maintenance treatment with bevacizumab/pemetrexed demonstrated a 50% reduction in risk of progression vs bevacizumab alone (median PFS: 10.2 vs 6.6 months). Maintenance treatment with bevacizumab/pemetrexed did not confer a significant increase in overall survival vs bevacizumab alone on follow up analysis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Barlesi F, Scherpereel A, Gorbunova V, Gervais R, Vikstr\u00f6m A, Chouaid C, Chella A, Kim JH, Ahn MJ, Reck M, Pazzola A, Kim HT, Aerts JG, Morando C, Loundou A, Groen HJ, Rittmeyer A | title = Maintenance bevacizumab-pemetrexed after first-line cisplatin-pemetrexed-bevacizumab for advanced nonsquamous nonsmall-cell lung cancer: updated survival analysis of the AVAPERL (MO22089) randomized phase III trial | journal = Annals of Oncology | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 1044\u201352 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24585722 | doi = 10.1093/annonc/mdu098 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\nThe National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends bevacizumab as standard first-line treatment in combination with any platinum-based chemotherapy, followed by maintenance bevacizumab until disease progression.{{mcn|date=March 2020}} Higher doses are usually given with carboplatin-based chemotherapy, whereas the lower dose is usually given with cisplatin-based chemotherapy.{{mcn|date=March 2020}}\n\n=== Breast cancer ===\nIn December 2010, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) notified its intention to remove the breast cancer indication (approved in 2008) from bevacizumab, saying that it had not been shown to be safe and effective in [[breast cancer]] patients. The combined data from four different clinical trials showed that bevacizumab neither prolonged overall survival nor slowed disease progression sufficiently to outweigh the risk it presents to patients. This only prevented Genentech from marketing bevacizumab for breast cancer.

The June 2011 meeting of the FDA's oncologic drug advisory committee was the last step in an appeal by the drug's maker.

The distinction between these terms is considered to be important. Race may be regarded as a \u201csocially constructed mechanism for self identification and group membership\u201d and so biologically meaningless, whereas ancestry is a \u201cscientifically derived descriptor of the biological component of population variation\u201d (Konigsberg et al. 2009: 77\u201378). So, why do the rather politically sensitive terms Caucasoid, Mongoloid, or Negroid still appear in published literature (Ousley et al. 2009)? There are considered to be four basic ancestry groups into which an individual can be placed by physical appearance, not accounting for admixture: the sub-Saharan African group (\u201cNegroid\u201d), the European group (\u201cCaucasoid\u201d), the Central Asian group (\u201cMongoloid\u201d), and the Australasian group (\u201cAustraloid\u201d). The rather outdated names of all but one of these groups were originally derived from geography: The Caucasoid group traversed the Caucasus Mountains as they spread into Europe and eastern Asia. Since the majority of native peoples from the Indian subcontinent, northern and northeastern Africa and the Near East fall into this group, to say that the group is of \u201cEuropean\u201d ancestry does not really suffice. Plus, the terms Caucasoid or Caucasian do not have the same oppressive, persecutory connotations as the other terms and so are less likely to cause offense.}}\n*{{cite book|author1=Robert B.

Some might protest that it is \"only a label.\" But language is one of the most systematic, subtle, and significant vehicles for transmitting racial ideology.

What is clear is that the two editions of Meiners's Outline were published between the second edition of Blumenbach's On the Natural Variety of Mankind and the third edition, where Blumenbach first used the term Caucasian. Blumenbach cited Meiners once in 1795, but only to include Meiners's 1793 division of humanity into \"handsome and white\" and \"ugly and dark\" peoples among several alternative \"divisions of the varieties of mankind.\" Yet Blumenbach must have been aware of Meiners's earlier designation of Caucasian and Mongolian branches of humanity, as the two men knew each other as colleagues at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. The way that Blumenbach embraced the term Caucasian suggests that he worked to distance his own anthropological thinking from that of Meiners while recovering the term Caucasian for his own more refined racial classification: he made no mention of Meiners's 1785 usage and gave the term a new meaning.</ref> In contrast to Meiners, however, Blumenbach was a monogenist \u2013 he considered all humans to have a shared origin and to be a single species.

[[Carleton S. Coon]] (1939) included the populations native to all of [[Central Asia|Central]] and Northern Asia, including the [[Ainu people]], under the Caucasoid label. However, many scientists maintained the racial categorizations of color established by Meiners' and Blumenbach's works, along with many other early steps of anthropology, well into the late 19th and mid-to-late 20th centuries, increasingly used to justify political policies, such as segregation and immigration restrictions, and other opinions based in prejudice. For example, [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] (1870) classified all populations of Asian nations as Mongoloid. [[Lothrop Stoddard]] (1920) in turn classified as \"brown\" most of the populations of the Middle East, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, Central Asia and South Asia.

The distinction between these terms is considered to be important. Race may be regarded as a \u201csocially constructed mechanism for self identification and group membership\u201d and so biologically meaningless, whereas ancestry is a \u201cscientifically derived descriptor of the biological component of population variation\u201d (Konigsberg et al. 2009: 77\u201378). So, why do the rather politically sensitive terms Caucasoid, Mongoloid, or Negroid still appear in published literature (Ousley et al. 2009)? There are considered to be four basic ancestry groups into which an individual can be placed by physical appearance, not accounting for admixture: the sub-Saharan African group (\u201cNegroid\u201d), the European group (\u201cCaucasoid\u201d), the Central Asian group (\u201cMongoloid\u201d), and the Australasian group (\u201cAustraloid\u201d). The rather outdated names of all but one of these groups were originally derived from geography: The Caucasoid group traversed the Caucasus Mountains as they spread into Europe and eastern Asia. Since the majority of native peoples from the Indian subcontinent, northern and northeastern Africa and the Near East fall into this group, to say that the group is of \u201cEuropean\u201d ancestry does not really suffice. Plus, the terms Caucasoid or Caucasian do not have the same oppressive, persecutory connotations as the other terms and so are less likely to cause offense.}}\n*{{cite book|author1=Robert B.

This model is used by many people to describe themselves and others. Therefore, it falls to the forensic investigator to use the term defined by the model in trying to identify the dead.

Some might protest that it is \"only a label.\" But language is one of the most systematic, subtle, and significant vehicles for transmitting racial ideology. Terms that describe imagined groups, such as Caucasian, encapsulate those beliefs. Every time we use them and uncritically expose students to them, we are reinforcing rather than dismantling the old racialized worldview.

What is clear is that the two editions of Meiners's Outline were published between the second edition of Blumenbach's On the Natural Variety of Mankind and the third edition, where Blumenbach first used the term Caucasian. Blumenbach cited Meiners once in 1795, but only to include Meiners's 1793 division of humanity into \"handsome and white\" and \"ugly and dark\" peoples among several alternative \"divisions of the varieties of mankind.\" Yet Blumenbach must have been aware of Meiners's earlier designation of Caucasian and Mongolian branches of humanity, as the two men knew each other as colleagues at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. The way that Blumenbach embraced the term Caucasian suggests that he worked to distance his own anthropological thinking from that of Meiners while recovering the term Caucasian for his own more refined racial classification: he made no mention of Meiners's 1785 usage and gave the term a new meaning.</ref> In contrast to Meiners, however, Blumenbach was a monogenist \u2013 he considered all humans to have a shared origin and to be a single species.

For example, [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] (1870) classified all populations of Asian nations as Mongoloid. [[Lothrop Stoddard]] (1920) in turn classified as \"brown\" most of the populations of the Middle East, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, Central Asia and South Asia.

These narratives record that Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, observed Simon and Andrew fishing, and called them to discipleship.\n\nIn the parallel incident in the [[Gospel of Luke]] ({{Bibleverse||Luke|5:1\u201311|NIV}}) Andrew is not named, nor is reference made to Simon having a brother. In this narrative, Jesus initially used a boat, solely described as being Simon's, as a platform for preaching to the multitudes on the shore and then as a means to achieving a huge trawl of fish on a night which had hitherto proved fruitless. The narrative indicates that Simon was not the only fisherman in the boat (''they signaled to their partners in the other boat \u2026'' ({{bibleverse||Luke|5:7|NIV}})) but it is not until the next chapter ({{bibleverse||Luke|6:14|NIV}}) that Andrew is named as Simon's brother. However, it is generally understood that Andrew was fishing with Simon on the night in question. [[Matthew Poole]], in his ''Annotations on the Holy Bible'', stressed that 'Luke denies not that Andrew was there'.<ref>[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/luke/5.htm Matthew Poole's Commentary] on Luke 5, accessed 19 February 2017</ref>\n\nIn contrast, the [[Gospel of John]] ({{bibleverse||John|1:35\u201342|NIV}}) states that Andrew was a disciple of [[John the Baptist]], whose testimony first led him, and another unnamed disciple of John the Baptist, to follow Jesus. Andrew at once recognized Jesus as the [[Messiah]], and hastened to introduce him to his brother.<ref name=\"shrine\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stmaryscathedral.co.uk/standrew/|title=National Shrine of St Andrew in Edinburgh Scotland|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Stmaryscathedral.co.uk|accessdate=30 November 2017}}</ref>  The Byzantine Church honours him with the name ''Protokletos'', which means \"the first called\".<ref name=Benedict/> Thenceforth, the two brothers were disciples of Christ. On a subsequent occasion, prior to the final call to the [[Apostolates|apostolate]], they were called to a closer companionship, and then they left all things to follow Jesus.\n\nSubsequently, in the gospels, Andrew is referred to as being present on some important occasions as one of the disciples more closely attached to Jesus.<ref>{{Bibleref2|Mark|13:3}}; {{Bibleref2|John|6:8}}, {{Bibleref2-nb|John|12:22}}; but in [[Acts of the Apostles]] there is only one mention of him.{{Bibleref2-nb|Acts|1:13}}</ref> Andrew told Jesus about the boy with the loaves and fishes ({{bibleverse||John|6:8|NIV}}), and when [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]] wanted to tell Jesus about certain Greeks seeking Him, he told Andrew first ({{bibleverse||John|12:20\u201322|NIV}}).

The [[Primary Chronicle|Chronicle of Nestor]] adds that he preached along the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] river as far as [[Kiev]], and from there he traveled to [[Veliky Novgorod|Novgorod]]. Hence, he became a [[patron saint]] of [[Ukraine]], [[Romania]] and [[Russia]]. According to tradition, he founded the [[Episcopal see|See]] of [[Byzantium]] (later [[Constantinople]] and [[Istanbul]]) in AD 38, installing [[Stachys the Apostle|Stachys]] as bishop. According to [[Hippolytus of Rome]], Andrew preached in [[Thrace]], and his presence in Byzantium is also mentioned in the apocryphal [[Acts of Andrew]].

A.D. 260,\" in the opinion of [[M. R. James]], who edited them in 1924. The Acts, as well as a ''Gospel of St Andrew'', appear among rejected books in the ''[[Decretum Gelasianum]]'' connected with the name of [[Pope Gelasius I]]. The Acts of Andrew was edited and published by [[Constantin von Tischendorf]] in the ''Acta Apostolorum apocrypha'' ([[Leipzig]], 1821), putting it for the first time into the hands of a critical professional readership.

Wherever he was shipwrecked, he was to build a shrine for them. St. Rule set sail, taking with him a kneecap, an upper arm bone, three fingers and a tooth. He sailed west, towards the edge of the known world, and was shipwrecked on the coast of [[Fife, Scotland]].

This tradition was apparently derived from the Byzantine sources, particularly Nicetas of Paphlagonia (died c. 890) who asserts that \"Andrew preached to the [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberians]], [[Sarmatians|Sauromatians]], [[Taurica|Taurians]], and [[Scythians]] and to every region and city, on the [[Black Sea]], both north and south.\"<ref>Peterson, Peter Megill (1958), ''Andrew, Brother of Simon Peter: His History and Legends'', p. 20. E. J. Brill</ref> The version was adopted by the 10th\u201311th-century Georgian ecclesiastics and, refurbished with more details, was inserted in the [[Georgian Chronicles]]. The story of Saint Andrew's mission in the Georgian lands endowed the Georgian church with apostolic origin and served as a defense argument to [[George the Hagiorite]] against the encroachments from the [[Church of Antioch|Antiochian church]] authorities on [[autocephaly]] of the Georgian church. Another Georgian monk, [[Ephrem Mtsire|Ephraim the Minor]], produced a thesis, reconciling Saint Andrew's story with an earlier evidence of the 4th-century conversion of Georgians by [[Saint Nino]] and explaining the necessity of the \"second Christening\" by Nino. The thesis was made canonical by the Georgian church council in 1103.<ref name=\"Rapp\">Rapp, Stephen H.

The former date, dedicated to Saint Andrew's arrival in Georgia, is a [[public holidays in Georgia (country)|public holiday in Georgia]].\n\n===Cyprus===\nCypriot tradition holds that a ship which was transporting Saint Andrew went off course and ran aground. Upon coming ashore, Andrew struck the rocks with his staff at which point a spring of healing waters gushed forth. Using it, the sight of the ship's captain, who had been blind in one eye, was restored. Thereafter, the site became a place of pilgrimage and a fortified monastery stood there in the 12th century, from which [[Isaac Comnenus of Cyprus|Isaac Comnenus]] negotiated his surrender to [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]]. In the 15th century, a small chapel was built close to the shore. The main monastery of the current church dates to the 18th century.\n\nOther pilgrimages are more recent. The story is told that in 1895, the son of a Maria Georgiou was kidnapped. Seventeen years later, Saint Andrew appeared to her in a dream, telling her to pray for her son's return at the monastery. Living in Anatolia, she embarked on the crossing to Cyprus on a very crowded boat. As she was telling her story during the journey, one of the passengers, a young Dervish priest, became more and more interested. Asking if her son had any distinguishing marks, he stripped off his clothes to reveal the same marks and mother and son were thus reunited.<ref name=\"whatson-northcyprus.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whatson-northcyprus.com/interest/dipkarpaz/andreas.htm |title=Apostolos Andreas Monastery, Karpaz, North Cyprus |publisher=Whatson-northcyprus.com |date= |accessdate=13 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n'''Apostolos Andreas Monastery''' ({{lang-el|\u0391\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u0391\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03ad\u03b1\u03c2}}) is a [[monastery]] dedicated to Saint Andrew situated just south of [[Cape Apostolos Andreas]], which is the north-easternmost point of the island of [[Cyprus]], in [[Rizokarpaso]] in the [[Karpass Peninsula]]. The monastery is an important site to the [[Cypriot Orthodox Church]]. It was once known as 'the Lourdes of Cyprus', served not by an organized community of monks but by a changing group of volunteer priests and laymen. Both [[Greek Cypriot]] and [[Turkish Cypriot]] communities consider the monastery a holy place. As such, it is visited by many people for votive prayers.\n\n===Malta===\n[[File:AndrewFrescoSPOW.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=mosaic of St. Andrew|Fifth-century mosaic of Saint Andrew at [[St. Paul Outside the Walls]], Rome]]\n\nThe first reference regards the small chapel at [[Luqa]] dedicated to Andrew dates to 1497. This chapel contained three altars, one of them dedicated to Andrew. The painting showing ''Mary with Saints Andrew and Paul'' was painted by the Maltese artist Filippo Dingli. At one time, many fishermen lived in the village of Luqa, and this may be the main reason for choosing Andrew as patron saint. The statue of Andrew was sculpted in wood by Giuseppe Scolaro in 1779. This statue underwent several restoration works including that of 1913 performed by the Maltese artist Abraham Gatt. The ''Martyrdom of Saint Andrew'' on the main altar of the church was painted by [[Mattia Preti]] in 1687.\n\n===Romania===\n[[File:Pe\u0219terile Sf. Apostol Andrei - detalii 01.JPG|thumb|left|Entrance to Saint Andrew's caves near Ion Corvin, [[Constan\u021ba County]]]]\n\n{{main|Saint Andrew in Romania}}\n\nThe official stance of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] is that Andrew preached the Gospel in the province of [[Dobruja]] ([[Scythia Minor]]) to the Daco-Romans, whom he is said to have converted to Christianity. Such a tradition was however not widely acknowledged until the 20th century.\n\nAccording to Hippolyte of Antioch, (died c. 250 C.E.) in his On Apostles, Origen in the third book of his ''Commentaries on the Genesis'' (254 C.E.), Eusebius of Caesarea in his Church History (340 C.E.), and other sources, such as Usaard's Martyrdom written between 845\u2013865, and Jacobus de Voragine's ''Golden Legend'' (c. 1260), Saint Andrew preached in Scythia, a possible reference to [[Scythia Minor]], whose territory was integrated into Romania in the late 19th century.\n\nAccording to some modern Romanian scholars, the idea of early Christianisation is unsustainable. They take the idea to be a part of an ideology of [[protochronism]] which purports that the Orthodox Church has been a companion and defender of the Romanian people for its entire history, which was then used for propaganda purposes during the communist era,<ref>Stan, Lavinia and Turcescu, Lucian. ''Religion and Politics in Post-Communist Romania'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2007, p.48</ref> although this is disputed.\n\n=== East Slavs ===\n[[File:Predskazanie Kiev sv Andrey.jpg|thumb|Saint Andrew's prophecy of Kiev depicted in [[Radzivill Chronicle]].]]\nTradition regarding the [[History of Christianity in Ukraine#Early history|early Christian history of Ukraine]] holds that the apostle Andrew preached on the southern borders of modern-day [[Ukraine]], along the [[Black Sea]]. Legend has it that he travelled up the [[Dnieper River]] and reached the future location of [[Kiev]], where he erected a cross on the site where the [[St Andrew's Church, Kiev|Saint Andrew's Church of Kiev]] currently stands, and where he prophesied the foundation of a great Christian city.<ref>Lytvynchuk, Janna. ''St. Andrew's Church'', p. 7, Kiev: Anateya, 2006, {{ISBN|966-8668-22-7}}</ref> Because of this connection to Kiev, Saint Andrew is considered to be the patron saint of the two [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] nations descended from the [[Kievan Rus]]: [[Ukraine]] and [[Russia]], the latter country using the [[Saltire|Saint Andrew's Cross]] on its [[Russian Navy Ensign|naval ensign]]. The third East Slavic nation, [[Belarus]], however, reveres [[Euphrosyne of Polotsk]], a local saint, as its patron instead.\n\n===Scotland===\n[[File:Flag of Scotland.svg|thumb|The [[Saltire]] (or \"Saint Andrew's Cross\") is the national [[flag of Scotland]]]]\n\nSeveral legends state that the relics of Andrew were brought by divine guidance from [[Constantinople]] to the place where the modern [[Scotland|Scottish]] town of [[St Andrews]] stands today ([[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]], ''Cill R\u00ecmhinn''). The oldest surviving manuscripts are two: one is among the manuscripts collected by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] and willed to [[Louis XIV of France]], now in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale]], Paris; the other is the [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Harleian Mss]] in the [[British Library]], London. They state that the relics of Andrew were brought by one [[St Regulus|Regulus]] to the [[Picts|Pictish]] king [[\u00d3engus I of the Picts|\u00d3engus mac Fergusa]] (729\u2013761). The only historical Regulus ([[Riagail]] or Rule) whose name is preserved in the [[St Andrews Cathedral#St Rule's tower|tower of St Rule]] was an Irish monk expelled from [[Ireland]] with Saint [[Columba]]; his dates, however, are c. 573 \u2013 600. There are good reasons for supposing that the relics were originally in the collection of [[Acca of Hexham|Acca, bishop of Hexham]], who took them into Pictish country when he was driven from Hexham (c. 732), and founded a see, not, according to tradition, in [[Galloway]], but on the site of St Andrews.\n\n[[File:St. Andrew carving, c.1500.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Saint Andrew, carving c.1500 in the National Museum of Scotland]]\nAccording legendary accounts given in 16th-century historiography, [[\u00d3engus II of the Picts|\u00d3engus II]] in AD 832 led an army of [[Picts]] and [[Scoti|Scots]] into battle against the [[Angles]], led by [[\u00c6thelstan]], near modern-day [[Athelstaneford]], [[East Lothian]]. The legend states that he was heavily outnumbered and hence whilst engaged in prayer on the eve of battle, \u00d3engus vowed that if granted victory he would appoint Saint Andrew as the Patron Saint of Scotland. On the morning of battle white clouds forming an X shape in the sky were said to have appeared. \u00d3engus and his combined force, emboldened by this apparent divine intervention, took to the field and despite being inferior in numbers were victorious. Having interpreted the cloud phenomenon as representing the ''crux decussata'' upon which Saint Andrew was crucified, \u00d3engus honoured his pre-battle pledge and duly appointed Saint Andrew as the Patron Saint of Scotland. The white saltire set against a celestial blue background is said to have been adopted as the design of the [[flag of Scotland]] on the basis of this legend.<ref>{{cite book |first=John |last=Parker Lawson |authorlink=John Parker Lawson |title=History of the Abbey and Palace of Holyroodhouse |publisher=H.

The carved Saint Andrew's cross in the left hand wooden post was to prevent witches from flying down the chimney, [[Ryedale Folk Museum]], [[Hutton-le-Hole]].]]\nAndrew's connection with Scotland may have been reinforced following the [[Synod of Whitby]], when the [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic Church]] felt that Columba had been \"outranked\" by Peter and that Peter's brother would make a higher ranking patron. The 1320 [[Declaration of Arbroath]] cites Scotland's conversion to Christianity by Andrew, \"the first to be an Apostle\". Numerous parish churches in the [[Church of Scotland]] and congregations of other Christian churches in Scotland are named after Andrew. The national church of the Scottish people in [[Rome]], [[Sant'Andrea degli Scozzesi]] is dedicated to Saint Andrew.\n\nA local [[superstition]] uses the cross of Saint Andrew as a [[hex sign]] on the fireplaces in northern [[England]] and [[Scotland]] to prevent [[witch]]es from flying down the [[chimney]] and entering the house to do mischief. By placing the Saint Andrew's cross on one of the [[fireplace]] posts or [[lintel]]s, witches are prevented from entering through this opening. In this case, it is similar to the use of a [[witch ball]], although the cross will actively prevent witches from entering, and the witch ball will passively delay or entice the witch, and perhaps entrap it.\n\n===Spain===\nA form of St. Andrew's cross called the [[Cross of Burgundy|Cross of Bourgogne]] was used as the flag of the Duchy of Burgundy, and after the Duchy was acquired by Spain, by the Spanish Crown, and later as a Spanish naval flag and finally as an army battle flag up until 1843. Today, it is still a part of various Spanish military insignia and makes part of the Coat of Arms of the king of Spain as it did with General Franco.\n[[File:Monument to Andrey Pervozvanniy..jpg|thumb|Monument to Andrey Pervozvanniy in Kyiv, Ukraine.

The [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Confederate flag]] also features a saltire commonly referred to as a St Andrew's cross, although its designer, [[William Porcher Miles]], said he changed it from an upright cross to a saltire so that it would not be a religious symbol but merely a heraldic device.

In this narrative, Jesus initially used a boat, solely described as being Simon's, as a platform for preaching to the multitudes on the shore and then as a means to achieving a huge trawl of fish on a night which had hitherto proved fruitless. The narrative indicates that Simon was not the only fisherman in the boat (''they signaled to their partners in the other boat \u2026'' ({{bibleverse||Luke|5:7|NIV}})) but it is not until the next chapter ({{bibleverse||Luke|6:14|NIV}}) that Andrew is named as Simon's brother.

The Acts, as well as a ''Gospel of St Andrew'', appear among rejected books in the ''[[Decretum Gelasianum]]'' connected with the name of [[Pope Gelasius I]]. The Acts of Andrew was edited and published by [[Constantin von Tischendorf]] in the ''Acta Apostolorum apocrypha'' ([[Leipzig]], 1821), putting it for the first time into the hands of a critical professional readership.

This tradition was apparently derived from the Byzantine sources, particularly Nicetas of Paphlagonia (died c. 890) who asserts that \"Andrew preached to the [[Caucasian Iberia|Iberians]], [[Sarmatians|Sauromatians]], [[Taurica|Taurians]], and [[Scythians]] and to every region and city, on the [[Black Sea]], both north and south.\"<ref>Peterson, Peter Megill (1958), ''Andrew, Brother of Simon Peter: His History and Legends'', p. 20. E. J. Brill</ref> The version was adopted by the 10th\u201311th-century Georgian ecclesiastics and, refurbished with more details, was inserted in the [[Georgian Chronicles]]. The story of Saint Andrew's mission in the Georgian lands endowed the Georgian church with apostolic origin and served as a defense argument to [[George the Hagiorite]] against the encroachments from the [[Church of Antioch|Antiochian church]] authorities on [[autocephaly]] of the Georgian church. Another Georgian monk, [[Ephrem Mtsire|Ephraim the Minor]], produced a thesis, reconciling Saint Andrew's story with an earlier evidence of the 4th-century conversion of Georgians by [[Saint Nino]] and explaining the necessity of the \"second Christening\" by Nino. The thesis was made canonical by the Georgian church council in 1103.<ref name=\"Rapp\">Rapp, Stephen H.

''[[Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium]]'', vol. 372, subsidia 48. Louvain, 1976.</ref> The Georgian Orthodox Church marks two feast days in honor of Saint Andrew, on 12 May and 13 December. The former date, dedicated to Saint Andrew's arrival in Georgia, is a [[public holidays in Georgia (country)|public holiday in Georgia]].\n\n===Cyprus===\nCypriot tradition holds that a ship which was transporting Saint Andrew went off course and ran aground. Upon coming ashore, Andrew struck the rocks with his staff at which point a spring of healing waters gushed forth. Using it, the sight of the ship's captain, who had been blind in one eye, was restored. Thereafter, the site became a place of pilgrimage and a fortified monastery stood there in the 12th century, from which [[Isaac Comnenus of Cyprus|Isaac Comnenus]] negotiated his surrender to [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]]. In the 15th century, a small chapel was built close to the shore. The main monastery of the current church dates to the 18th century.\n\nOther pilgrimages are more recent. The story is told that in 1895, the son of a Maria Georgiou was kidnapped. Seventeen years later, Saint Andrew appeared to her in a dream, telling her to pray for her son's return at the monastery. Living in Anatolia, she embarked on the crossing to Cyprus on a very crowded boat. As she was telling her story during the journey, one of the passengers, a young Dervish priest, became more and more interested. Asking if her son had any distinguishing marks, he stripped off his clothes to reveal the same marks and mother and son were thus reunited.<ref name=\"whatson-northcyprus.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whatson-northcyprus.com/interest/dipkarpaz/andreas.htm |title=Apostolos Andreas Monastery, Karpaz, North Cyprus |publisher=Whatson-northcyprus.com |date= |accessdate=13 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n'''Apostolos Andreas Monastery''' ({{lang-el|\u0391\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u0391\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03ad\u03b1\u03c2}}) is a [[monastery]] dedicated to Saint Andrew situated just south of [[Cape Apostolos Andreas]], which is the north-easternmost point of the island of [[Cyprus]], in [[Rizokarpaso]] in the [[Karpass Peninsula]]. The monastery is an important site to the [[Cypriot Orthodox Church]]. It was once known as 'the Lourdes of Cyprus', served not by an organized community of monks but by a changing group of volunteer priests and laymen. Both [[Greek Cypriot]] and [[Turkish Cypriot]] communities consider the monastery a holy place. As such, it is visited by many people for votive prayers.\n\n===Malta===\n[[File:AndrewFrescoSPOW.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=mosaic of St. Andrew|Fifth-century mosaic of Saint Andrew at [[St. Paul Outside the Walls]], Rome]]\n\nThe first reference regards the small chapel at [[Luqa]] dedicated to Andrew dates to 1497. This chapel contained three altars, one of them dedicated to Andrew. The painting showing ''Mary with Saints Andrew and Paul'' was painted by the Maltese artist Filippo Dingli. At one time, many fishermen lived in the village of Luqa, and this may be the main reason for choosing Andrew as patron saint. The statue of Andrew was sculpted in wood by Giuseppe Scolaro in 1779. This statue underwent several restoration works including that of 1913 performed by the Maltese artist Abraham Gatt. The ''Martyrdom of Saint Andrew'' on the main altar of the church was painted by [[Mattia Preti]] in 1687.\n\n===Romania===\n[[File:Pe\u0219terile Sf. Apostol Andrei - detalii 01.JPG|thumb|left|Entrance to Saint Andrew's caves near Ion Corvin, [[Constan\u021ba County]]]]\n\n{{main|Saint Andrew in Romania}}\n\nThe official stance of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] is that Andrew preached the Gospel in the province of [[Dobruja]] ([[Scythia Minor]]) to the Daco-Romans, whom he is said to have converted to Christianity. Such a tradition was however not widely acknowledged until the 20th century.\n\nAccording to Hippolyte of Antioch, (died c. 250 C.E.) in his On Apostles, Origen in the third book of his ''Commentaries on the Genesis'' (254 C.E.), Eusebius of Caesarea in his Church History (340 C.E.), and other sources, such as Usaard's Martyrdom written between 845\u2013865, and Jacobus de Voragine's ''Golden Legend'' (c. 1260), Saint Andrew preached in Scythia, a possible reference to [[Scythia Minor]], whose territory was integrated into Romania in the late 19th century.\n\nAccording to some modern Romanian scholars, the idea of early Christianisation is unsustainable. They take the idea to be a part of an ideology of [[protochronism]] which purports that the Orthodox Church has been a companion and defender of the Romanian people for its entire history, which was then used for propaganda purposes during the communist era,<ref>Stan, Lavinia and Turcescu, Lucian. ''Religion and Politics in Post-Communist Romania'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2007, p.48</ref> although this is disputed.\n\n=== East Slavs ===\n[[File:Predskazanie Kiev sv Andrey.jpg|thumb|Saint Andrew's prophecy of Kiev depicted in [[Radzivill Chronicle]].]]\nTradition regarding the [[History of Christianity in Ukraine#Early history|early Christian history of Ukraine]] holds that the apostle Andrew preached on the southern borders of modern-day [[Ukraine]], along the [[Black Sea]]. Legend has it that he travelled up the [[Dnieper River]] and reached the future location of [[Kiev]], where he erected a cross on the site where the [[St Andrew's Church, Kiev|Saint Andrew's Church of Kiev]] currently stands, and where he prophesied the foundation of a great Christian city.<ref>Lytvynchuk, Janna. ''St. Andrew's Church'', p. 7, Kiev: Anateya, 2006, {{ISBN|966-8668-22-7}}</ref> Because of this connection to Kiev, Saint Andrew is considered to be the patron saint of the two [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] nations descended from the [[Kievan Rus]]: [[Ukraine]] and [[Russia]], the latter country using the [[Saltire|Saint Andrew's Cross]] on its [[Russian Navy Ensign|naval ensign]]. The third East Slavic nation, [[Belarus]], however, reveres [[Euphrosyne of Polotsk]], a local saint, as its patron instead.\n\n===Scotland===\n[[File:Flag of Scotland.svg|thumb|The [[Saltire]] (or \"Saint Andrew's Cross\") is the national [[flag of Scotland]]]]\n\nSeveral legends state that the relics of Andrew were brought by divine guidance from [[Constantinople]] to the place where the modern [[Scotland|Scottish]] town of [[St Andrews]] stands today ([[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]], ''Cill R\u00ecmhinn''). The oldest surviving manuscripts are two: one is among the manuscripts collected by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] and willed to [[Louis XIV of France]], now in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale]], Paris; the other is the [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Harleian Mss]] in the [[British Library]], London. They state that the relics of Andrew were brought by one [[St Regulus|Regulus]] to the [[Picts|Pictish]] king [[\u00d3engus I of the Picts|\u00d3engus mac Fergusa]] (729\u2013761). The only historical Regulus ([[Riagail]] or Rule) whose name is preserved in the [[St Andrews Cathedral#St Rule's tower|tower of St Rule]] was an Irish monk expelled from [[Ireland]] with Saint [[Columba]]; his dates, however, are c. 573 \u2013 600. There are good reasons for supposing that the relics were originally in the collection of [[Acca of Hexham|Acca, bishop of Hexham]], who took them into Pictish country when he was driven from Hexham (c. 732), and founded a see, not, according to tradition, in [[Galloway]], but on the site of St Andrews.\n\n[[File:St. Andrew carving, c.1500.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Saint Andrew, carving c.1500 in the National Museum of Scotland]]\nAccording legendary accounts given in 16th-century historiography, [[\u00d3engus II of the Picts|\u00d3engus II]] in AD 832 led an army of [[Picts]] and [[Scoti|Scots]] into battle against the [[Angles]], led by [[\u00c6thelstan]], near modern-day [[Athelstaneford]], [[East Lothian]]. The legend states that he was heavily outnumbered and hence whilst engaged in prayer on the eve of battle, \u00d3engus vowed that if granted victory he would appoint Saint Andrew as the Patron Saint of Scotland. On the morning of battle white clouds forming an X shape in the sky were said to have appeared. \u00d3engus and his combined force, emboldened by this apparent divine intervention, took to the field and despite being inferior in numbers were victorious. Having interpreted the cloud phenomenon as representing the ''crux decussata'' upon which Saint Andrew was crucified, \u00d3engus honoured his pre-battle pledge and duly appointed Saint Andrew as the Patron Saint of Scotland. The white saltire set against a celestial blue background is said to have been adopted as the design of the [[flag of Scotland]] on the basis of this legend.<ref>{{cite book |first=John |last=Parker Lawson |authorlink=John Parker Lawson |title=History of the Abbey and Palace of Holyroodhouse |publisher=H. Courtoy |year=1848 |page= [https://archive.org/details/historyabbeyand01lawsgoog/page/n197 169] |url=https://archive.org/details/historyabbeyand01lawsgoog |quote=battle athelstaneford Andrew. }}</ref> However, there is evidence that Andrew was venerated in Scotland before this.\n\n[[File:Cottage interior, Ryedale Folk Museum.jpg|thumb|Traditional stone fireplace in northern England. The carved Saint Andrew's cross in the left hand wooden post was to prevent witches from flying down the chimney, [[Ryedale Folk Museum]], [[Hutton-le-Hole]].]]\nAndrew's connection with Scotland may have been reinforced following the [[Synod of Whitby]], when the [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic Church]] felt that Columba had been \"outranked\" by Peter and that Peter's brother would make a higher ranking patron. The 1320 [[Declaration of Arbroath]] cites Scotland's conversion to Christianity by Andrew, \"the first to be an Apostle\". Numerous parish churches in the [[Church of Scotland]] and congregations of other Christian churches in Scotland are named after Andrew. The national church of the Scottish people in [[Rome]], [[Sant'Andrea degli Scozzesi]] is dedicated to Saint Andrew.\n\nA local [[superstition]] uses the cross of Saint Andrew as a [[hex sign]] on the fireplaces in northern [[England]] and [[Scotland]] to prevent [[witch]]es from flying down the [[chimney]] and entering the house to do mischief. By placing the Saint Andrew's cross on one of the [[fireplace]] posts or [[lintel]]s, witches are prevented from entering through this opening. In this case, it is similar to the use of a [[witch ball]], although the cross will actively prevent witches from entering, and the witch ball will passively delay or entice the witch, and perhaps entrap it.\n\n===Spain===\nA form of St. Andrew's cross called the [[Cross of Burgundy|Cross of Bourgogne]] was used as the flag of the Duchy of Burgundy, and after the Duchy was acquired by Spain, by the Spanish Crown, and later as a Spanish naval flag and finally as an army battle flag up until 1843. Today, it is still a part of various Spanish military insignia and makes part of the Coat of Arms of the king of Spain as it did with General Franco.\n[[File:Monument to Andrey Pervozvanniy..jpg|thumb|Monument to Andrey Pervozvanniy in Kyiv, Ukraine. The authors are [[Boris Krylov]] and Oles Sydoruk.]]\nIn [[Spain]], Saint Andrew is the patron of several locations: [[San Andr\u00e9s, Santa Cruz de Tenerife|San Andr\u00e9s]] ([[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]]), [[San Andr\u00e9s y Sauces]] ([[La Palma]]), [[Navalmoral de la Mata]] ([[C\u00e1ceres (province)|C\u00e1ceres]]), [[\u00c9ibar]] ([[Guip\u00fazcoa]]), [[Baeza]] ([[Province of Ja\u00e9n (Spain)|Ja\u00e9n]]), [[Pobladura de Pelayo Garc\u00eda]] and [[Pobladura de Yuso]] ([[Province of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]]), [[Berlangas de Roa]] ([[Burgos]]), [[Lig\u00fcerzana]] ([[Palencia]]), [[Castillo de Bayuela]] ([[Toledo (province)|Toledo]]), [[Almorad\u00ed]] ([[Alicante]]), [[Estella-Lizarra|Estella]] ([[Navarra]]), [[San Andr\u00e9s de Palomar]], ([[Barcelona]]), [[Pujalt]] [[(Catalonia)]], [[Adamuz]] ([[Province of C\u00f3rdoba (Spain)|C\u00f3rdoba]]) and {{Interlanguage link multi|San Andr\u00e9s (La Rioja)|es|lt=San Andr\u00e9s}} in [[Cameros]] ([[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]]).\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:St Andrew the Apostle - Bulgarian icon.jpg|thumb|upright|''Saint Andrew the Apostle'' by Yoan from Gabrovo, 19th century]]\nAndrew is the [[patron saint]] of several countries and cities including: Barbados, Romania, Russia, Scotland, Ukraine, [[Sarzana]],<ref name=\"cattedraledisarzana.it\">http://www.cattedraledisarzana.it/main.php?m=4&s=200&l=</ref> [[Pienza]]<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Gb5NDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT300&lpg=PT300 |title=Lonely Planet Florence & Tuscany |publisher=Lonely Planet |year=2018 |page=300|isbn=9781787011939 }}</ref> and [[Amalfi]] in Italy, [[Esgueira]] in Portugal, [[Luqa]] in Malta, [[Para\u00f1aque]] in the Philippines and [[Patras]] in Greece.

The saltire is also the [[flag of Tenerife]], the former [[flag of Galicia]] and the [[Russian Navy Ensign]]. The [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Confederate flag]] also features a saltire commonly referred to as a St Andrew's cross, although its designer, [[William Porcher Miles]], said he changed it from an upright cross to a saltire so that it would not be a religious symbol but merely a heraldic device. The [[flag of Alabama|Alabama]] flag also shows that device.\n\nThe [[St Andrew's Day|feast of Andrew]] is observed on 30 November in both the Eastern and Western churches, and is the [[national day]] of Scotland.

By far the most significant (and at the same time the most well preserved one) is the Seat Fortress of Suceava ({{lang-ro|Cetatea de Scaun a Sucevei}}) or Suceava Citadel, a medieval castle situated on the eastern edge of the contemporary city.\n\nThe fortress was built during the reign of [[Petru II of Moldavia|Petru of Moldavia]] (1375\u20131391), also known as Petru Mu\u0219at. It was further expanded and strengthened during the reigns of [[Alexander I of Moldavia]] (1400\u20131432) and [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]] (1457\u20131504). The medieval castle was part of the fortification system built in [[Moldavia]] in the late 14th century, because of the emergence of the Ottoman danger. It became strong enough to hold off an attack by Ottoman sultan [[Mehmed II]] (the conqueror of [[Constantinople]]), in 1476.\n\nSuceava was the capital city of the former Principality of Moldavia between 1388 and 1565. During this period, the castle served as princely residence. [[Alexandru L\u0103pu\u0219neanu]] had subsequently moved the Moldavian capital to [[Ia\u0219i]] in 1565, so the castle lost its status. Afterwards, the citadel entered a period of steep decline. In 1675, during the reign of voivode Dumitra\u0219cu Cantacuzino, the fortress was destroyed. Then, for over two centuries, the castle was completely deserted.\n\n[[File:Cetatea de Scaun a Sucevei la ceas de seara.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The late 14th century Moldavian seat fortress as seen during nighttime in May, 2015.]]\n\nIn late 19th century and early 20th century, under the patronage of Austrian architect [[:ro:Karl Romstorfer|Karl Adolf Romstorfer]], a series of rehabilitation works and archaeological research were conducted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dragusanul.ro/romstorfer-vienezul-care-a-indatorat-bucovina/|author=Dragu\u0219anul.ro|work=Dr\u0103gu\u0219anul|title=Romstorfer, vienezul care a \u00eendatorat Bucovina (in Romanian)|accessdate= 8 March 2020}}</ref> Between 1961 and 1970 other restoration and consolidation works were carried out. In 2013, a major reconstruction program was launched, to return the castle to its original architecture and shape.\n\nThe Seat Fortress of Suceava consists of two concentric citadels. The inner citadel, known as ''fortul mu\u0219atin'', has a rectangular shape and a patio. It was built by Petru Mu\u0219at in late 14th century. In the second half of the 15th century, Stephen the Great expanded the structure, by adding another citadel that has a circular shape which surrounds the old one.\n\nAfter 1476, new fortifications were added to the outer citadel. Furthermore, the whole castle is encircled by a large defensive ditch. Today, the fortress is a landmark of Suceava and a noteworthy touristic attraction. Since 2011, it has also been used for hosting cultural events such as the [[rock music]] festival Bucovina Rock Castle. The festival had attracted a series of noteworthy national and international musical acts (e.g. guitarist [[Jan Akkerman]], formerly of Dutch [[progressive rock]] band [[Focus (band)|Focus]]).<ref>[http://www.bucovinarockcastle.ro Bucovina Rock Castle official website (in Romanian)]</ref>\n\n===The Princely Court of Suceava===\n\n[[File:Curtea domneasca din Suceava9.jpg|thumb|left|Present-day ruins of the local Princely Court.]]\n\nThe Princely Court of Suceava ({{lang-ro|Curtea Domneasc\u0103 din Suceava}}) was built and developed related with the Seat Fortress. In late 14th century, voivode Petru Mu\u0219at built the Princely House, a structure made in wood, which included a cellar. After 1400, Alexander I of Moldavia rebuilt the wooden house and added a surrounding wall made of stone and a complex of buildings, also made of stone. In the second half of the 15th century, the Princely Court was severely affected by fire, the wooden house being completely burned out.\n\nDuring his reign, Stephen the Great (1457\u20131504) restored the whole complex. A new Princely House was built, this time made of stone, and the other buildings were extended. [[Vasile Lupu]] (1634\u20131653) was the last ruler of Moldavia who took care of the Princely Court. During his time, the cellars were rehabilitated. The complex was abandoned in late 17th century, the buildings and the walls being gradually dismantled. Currently, on the site of the Princely Court there are only ruins and leftovers of the former buildings.\n\nThe ruins of the former medieval court are located in the city center of Suceava. In the 14th\u201317th centuries, in the proximity of the Princely Court there were built several churches that still exist today and attract tourists.\n\n[[File:Cetatea \u015echeia10.jpg|thumb|right|The ruined walls of the \u0218cheia Fortress on \u0218eptilici Hill.]]\n\n===\u0218cheia Fortress===\n\nOn the north-western edge of the contemporary city, on a hilltop, there is another medieval citadel known as ''\u0218cheia'' Fortress ({{lang-ro|Cetatea \u0218cheia}}) or the Western Fortress of Suceava ({{lang-ro|Cetatea de Apus a Sucevei}}). Unlike the Seat Fortress, ''\u0218cheia'' Fortress has left nothing but some ruined walls. The citadel proper was built during the reign of Petru Mu\u0219at during the late 14th century, but was short-lived, given that it was dismantled during the early 15th century, in the time of [[Alexander I of Moldavia]]. ''\u0218cheia'' Fortress, just like the main Seat Fortress, was part of the fortification system built in medieval Principality of Moldavia during the late 14th century.\n\n===Museums===\n\n[[File:Muzeul Judetean din Suceava7.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The entrance to the Bukovina History Museum. During the [[interwar period]], the building served as Suceava County prefecture.]]\n\nThe first museum in Suceava was opened in 1900, by the initiative of some local intellectuals. In the beginning, the museum included only a few collections that were obtained as a result of the researches and excavation works at the Seat Fortress of Suceava. The museum was expanded and developed over time and became an important cultural institution, currently named [[Bukovina Museum]] ({{lang-ro|Muzeul Bucovinei}}). It has several departments and administers the medieval sites of the Seat Fortress, ''\u0218cheia'' Fortress and the Princely Court, local museums (Bukovina Village Museum, the history, ethnographic, and natural sciences museums), the memorial houses of [[Simion Florea Marian]] in Suceava, [[Nicolae Labi\u0219]] in [[M\u0103lini]], [[:ro:Eusebiu Camilar|Eusebiu Camilar]] in [[Ude\u0219ti]], [[Ciprian Porumbescu]] in [[Ciprian Porumbescu, Suceava|Stupca]], and two traditional houses located in [[Solca]] and [[Bilca]].\n\nThe oldest department of Bukovina Museum is the history museum, which was the backbone for creating a county museum at Suceava. This museum presents the local history of Suceava and Moldavia in the context of Romanian national history. The exhibits of the history museum and the offices of Bukovina Museum are located in a historic building, in the city center. The building, which hosted the prefecture of Suceava County during the interwar period, was built between 1902\u20131903. Since 1968, it houses the history museum. In 2014, the building and the museum entered an extensive program of modernization, rehabilitation, and expansion.\n\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|total_width=300|align=left\n|image1 = Cr\u00e2\u0219ma din \u0218aru Dornei - panoramio.jpg|caption1=Inn from [[Vatra Dornei|Dorna]] ({{lang-de|Dorna Watra}}) ethnographic area, exhibited at Bukovina Village Museum\n|image2 = Casa Vicovu de Jos1.jpg|caption2=Traditional household from [[Vicovu de Jos]] ({{lang-de|Unter Wikow}})\n|image3 = Gospod\u0103ria Straja6.jpg|caption3=Traditional household from [[Straja, Suceava|Straja]] ({{lang-de|Strasza}})\n|image4 = Moara din M\u0103n\u0103stirea Humorului.jpg|caption4=Windmill from [[M\u0103n\u0103stirea Humorului]] ({{lang-de|Humora Kloster}})\n}}\n\nAt the history museum there is a reconstitution of a scene from the former throne hall located in the Seat Fortress.

The scene chosen to be reconstructed is an allotment of land for peasants. The reconstitution is based on medieval documents, frescoes and archaeological researches. Furthermore, the history museum periodically organizes a wide range of cultural events, several of which also involve the local branch of the [[Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.istorielocala.ro/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=878:forumul-democrat-al-germanilor-din-bucovina&Itemid=204|author=www.istorielocala.ro|work=Istoria Local\u0103 @ biblioteca ta public\u0103|title=Forumul Democrat al Germanilor din Bucovina (in Romanian)|date= 14 October 2013| accessdate= 16 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adz.ro/artikel/artikel/die-geschichte-der-deutschen-in-rumaenien-wurde-noch-nicht-zu-ende-geschrieben/|author=www.adz.ro|work=Allgemeine Deutsche Zeitung f\u00fcr Rum\u00e4nien|title=Die Geschichte der Deutschen in Rum\u00e4nien wurde noch nicht zu Ende geschrieben (in German)|date= 8 January 2014| accessdate= 1 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nBukovina Village Museum ({{lang-ro|Muzeul Satului Bucovinean}}) is an open-air museum that highlights the traditional cultural and architectural heritage of [[Bukovina]] region. It is located in the eastern part of Suceava, near the Seat Fortress. It was founded in the 1970s, but its major expansion and development took place after 1990. The museum is designed as a traditional village in Bukovina, containing houses and various objectives from the ethnographic areas of [[R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi]], [[Gura Humorului|Humor]], [[C\u00e2mpulung Moldovenesc]], [[Vatra Dornei|Dorna]], and [[F\u0103lticeni]].\n\nThe museum includes among others a water mill from [[M\u0103n\u0103stirea Humorului]], a traditional blacksmith workshop, a pottery workshop from [[Marginea]] and one of the many old wooden churches in northern Moldavia: Church of the Ascension, a Romanian Orthodox wooden church built in 1783 in [[Vama, Suceava|Vama]], a village in [[Suceava County]]. The bell tower is also made in wood, and dates from 1787. The church and the bell tower were both relocated in 2001, and currently are part of the museum.\n\n[[File:Hanul Domnesc din Suceava9.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to the Princely Inn (now Ethnographic Museum)]]\n\nBesides Bukovina Village Museum, another museum that reflects the traditional life in this part of Romania is the ethnographic museum. It was opened in 1968 and includes old collections and exhibits that are housed in a medieval inn located in the center of Suceava, known as the Princely Inn of Suceava ({{lang-ro|Hanul Domnesc din Suceava}}). This landmark dates from the late 16th and early 17th century. It was built of stone and has two floors and a cellar. During the Austrian rule (1775\u20131918), the inn operated as a hunting lodge for the imperial family. Since 1968, it hosts the ethnographic museum. The Princely Inn is the oldest civic building in Suceava which had not been seriously affected by time and maintained its original architecture.\n\n[[File:Muzeul de Stiintele Naturii din Suceava4.jpg|thumb|right|Natural Sciences Museum]]\n\nThe natural sciences museum was founded in 1976\u20131977, being the newest museum in Suceava. It highlights the flora and fauna of the surrounding area. The museum's rare exhibits and collections are housed in an old building, located in the central park of the city and built between 1811\u20131814. In the past, before being an attraction for visitors, the building operated as a school for boys.\n\nAlong with all these museums, Bukovina Museum includes memorial houses of some writers and artists born in this area of the country. The memorial house of Simion Florea Marian ({{lang-ro|Casa memorial\u0103 Simion Florea Marian}}) is the only one located in Suceava, the other ones being in the surrounding area. The memorial house operates as a museum. It was opened in 1974 in the home where Romanian priest and writer Simion Florea Marian lived, from 1884 until 1907, when he died. The museum hosts a collection that contains over 10,000 volumes, over 450 collections of magazines and newspapers, of which 150 are from [[Bukovina]], manuscripts, letters, cultural and historical documents, old photos. In front of the memorial house it was opened a small park with a statue dedicated to Simion Florea Marian.\n\n===Historical buildings===\n\n[[File:Casa Aleea Trandafirilor nr. 4 din Suceava1.jpg|thumb|left|Austrian-style house situated in the old city centre.]]\n\n''Colegiul de Art\u0103 Ciprian Porumbescu'' ({{lang-ro|Ciprian Porumbescu Art College}}) is a high school which is hosted in a historic building, built in 1859, in the city center of Suceava. The building had several destinations in the past: Suceava Town Hall (until 1904) and ''\u0218coala primar\u0103 rom\u00e2n\u0103 de fete'' (Primary Romanian school for girls).

Initially established as a small village in the 15th century under the rulership of [[Alex\u0103ndrel of Moldavia]], it subsequently expanded as a German-speaking colony much later, specifically starting in the late 19th century, seeing an influx of German settlers during the [[Josephine colonization]] ({{lang-de|Josephinische Kolonisation}}) which took place in the time of the [[Austrian Empire]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bukovinasociety.org/buko/sitefiles/Talsky-Josef-Heimat-von-gestern-Regional-distribution-of-Germans-in-Bukovina.html|author=www.bukovinasociety.org|work=The Bukovina Society of the Americas|title=The Regional Distribution of the Germans in Bukovina|accessdate= 16 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bukovinasociety.org/buko/sitefiles/Stephani-Claus-1978-Settlement-of-German-Population-Groups-in-Bukovina-E.html|author=www.bukovinasociety.org|work=The Bukovina Society of the Americas|title=The Golden Bistritz - The Settlement of German Population Groups in Bukovina|accessdate= 16 June 2018}}</ref> [[Suceava North railway station|The north railway station]] (which depicts architectural elements of both [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic revival]] and [[Neo-romanticism|Neo-romanticist]] styles, also the oldest in the city) is situated in this neighbourhood as well.\n\n=== Monuments ===\n\nNear the fortress, in \u0218ipote-Cetate Park, there is an [[equestrian statue]] of Stephen the Great, designed and made by the local sculptor Iftimie B\u00e2rleanu in 1977. The monument has 23 meters in height, being the tallest equestrian statue in Romania. In the city centre there's also a statue dedicated to [[Petru Mu\u0219at]], Prince of Moldavia between 1375\u20131391.\n\n===Religious buildings===\n\n====Romanian Orthodox churches====\n\nOne of the most important cultural sites in Suceava is [[Saint John the New Monastery]] which includes the monumental Church of [[Saint George]], built between 1514 and 1522. The construction began during the reign of voivode [[Bogdan III the One-Eyed]] of Moldavia, after the nearby Mir\u0103u\u021bi Church (the metropolitan cathedral of Moldavia at that moment) was devastated in 1513. The construction was completed by [[Stephen IV of Moldavia]] (also known as \u0218tef\u0103ni\u021b\u0103). The monastery church served as metropolitan cathedral of Moldavia until 1677. It has frescoes painted on the outside, typical of the region, and is one of eight buildings that make up the [[churches of Moldavia]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/598 Churches of Moldavia] at the UNESCO site</ref> Since 1991 Saint John the New Monastery serves as the cathedral of the [[Archdiocese of Suceava and R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi]]. Saint John the New<ref>[http://sfantulioancelnou.8k.ro/ sfantulioancelnou.8k.ro] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227211255/http://sfantulioancelnou.8k.ro/ |date=2009-12-27 }}</ref> was a Moldavian monk who preached during Turkish occupation and was subsequently martyred in Cetatea Alb\u0103, present-day [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi]] in [[Ukraine]]. [[Alexander I of Moldavia]] brought his relics to Suceava in 1402.\n\nMir\u0103u\u021bi Church, dedicated to Saint George, is the oldest religious building in Suceava, founded by [[Petru II of Moldavia]] in late 14th century, in the same period with the Seat Fortress, when he moved the capital from [[Siret]] to Suceava. The church established the city as a see of it. Mir\u0103u\u021bi was the metropolitan cathedral of Moldavia between 1402 and 1522, when the church of Saint John the New Monastery was completed. In 1402, the relics of Saint John the New were transferred to this church from [[Cetatea Alb\u0103]], and then, in 1589 transferred again to the nearby monastery church by voivode [[Peter the Lame]]. The name ''Mir\u0103u\u021bi'' derives from the fact that it was the coronation church of Moldavia until 1522. [[Stephen the Great]] was crowned in here in 1457. After the church was devastated, it was rebuilt in early 17th century, and then, in the 18th century, abandoned.\n\nChurch of [[Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki|Saint Demetrius]] was founded by [[Peter IV Rare\u0219]], ruler of Moldavia (1527\u20131538, 1541\u20131546), and the son of Stephan the Great. The church was built in 1534\u20131535, with a bell tower added in 1560\u20131561 by Alexandru L\u0103pu\u0219neanu. The bell tower is 40 meters high, being the tallest bell tower in Suceava and a landmark of the city. The church had frescoes painted on the outside, that are still visible on one side wall. The frescoes inside were restored recently. Church of Saint Demetrius is located near the ruins of the former Princely Court of Suceava.\n\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=300\n| image1 = M\u0103n\u0103stirea Sf\u00e2ntul Ioan cel Nou35.jpg\n| image2 = Biserica Sf.

Church of [[Saint John the Baptist]], also known as Coconilor Church or Domni\u021belor Church, was founded in 1643 by [[Vasile Lupu]], voivode of Moldavia between 1632 and 1653. It has no exterior frescoes and a short bell tower that has its roof linked with the roof above the church. In its early days, the church functioned as a chapel for the Princely Court.\n\nChurch of the Resurrection (located in the proximity of Saint John the New Monastery) dates from 1551, and was founded by Elena Rare\u0219, the wife of voivode Peter IV Rare\u0219. The church has no tower above the [[cella|naos]], its architecture reflecting the urban style of the medieval period. Instead of the bell tower, the church has a [[zvonnitsa]], an architectural form especially used in the [[Russian architecture]] of the 14th\u201317th centuries. Church of the Resurrection was used by the local Roman Catholic community during the Habsburg occupation, and then by the Ruthenian Greek Catholic community, until 1936. It is also known as ''V\u0103scresenia Church'' or ''Elena Doamna'' Church.\n\nChurch of [[Saint Nicholas]] (Pr\u0103jescu) is another religious building in Suceava that features the medieval Moldavian architectural style. The present church was rebuilt by treasurer Nicoar\u0103 Pr\u0103jescu in 1611, during the reign of Constantin Movil\u0103 (1607\u20131611). Throughout its history, the church functioned as a necropolis for the local [[boyar]]s.\n\nBetween the city center and I\u021bcani neighborhood, on the slopes that descend to the [[Suceava (river)|Suceava river valley]], there is Church of the Assumption, another old Romanian Orthodox church, founded in the first half of the 17th century (1639). The church was built on the place where I\u021bcani Monastery existed before. It functioned as a nunnery until late 18th century. Today it is parish church, and has a zvonnitsa similar to that of Church of the Resurrection, located downtown.\n\nIn Burdujeni neighborhood, {{convert|4|km|0|abbr=on}} north-east of the city center, there is Teodoreni Monastery, founded in 1597 by local boyar Teodor Movil\u0103, the elder brother of [[Ieremia Movil\u0103]], ruler of Moldavia (1595\u20131600, 1600\u20131606). Burdujeni village (now a district of Suceava) was established and developed around this monastery. The set of buildings includes Church of Ascension, the bell tower, living quarters for nuns and a surrounding wall. Just {{convert|1|km|1|abbr=on}} north of Teodoreni Monastery, in the old district of Burdujeni, there is Church of the Holy Trinity, founded by archimandrite Filaret Scriban in 1851.\n\nI\u021bcani neighborhood has two Romanian Orthodox churches founded in the first half of the 20th century: Church of the Holy Archangels (built near [[Suceava North railway station]], in 1933\u20131938) and Church of the Holy Apostles (located on [[European route E85]] and built in 1905\u20131908 by the German community of I\u021bcani, initially as a Lutheran church).\n\n[[Church of the Holy Cross, P\u0103tr\u0103u\u021bi|Church of the Holy Cross]], located in [[P\u0103tr\u0103u\u021bi]] village (a few miles north-west of I\u021bcani), was founded in 1487 by Stephen the Great, and is one of the monuments that make up the [[churches of Moldavia]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. Also not far away from I\u021bcani, there is [[Dragomirna Monastery]], established by clergyman [[Anastasie Crimca]] in 1609. [[Vorone\u021b Monastery]] is located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=on}} west of Suceava, in the town of [[Gura Humorului]].\n\n====German Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches====\n\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=200\n| image1 = Biserica Sf.

They were of both Roman Catholic and Evangelical Lutheran faith given the fact that they had a rather diverse geographic origin from which they initially stemmed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bukowinafreunde.de/Neuer%20Ordner/faq/Bukovina%20and%20its%20Bukovina%20Germans.pdf|author=www.bukowinafreunde.de|work=Bukowina Freunde|title=Bukovina and its Bukovina Germans by Willi Kosiul|accessdate= 16 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://master.cedcsv.ro/cedc/infos/informatica/Minoritatile_conlocuitoare_din_judetul_Suceava/Germanii/germanii.html|author=www.mastercedcsv.ro|work=Minorit\u0103\u021bile conlocuitoare din jude\u021bul Suceava|title=Germanii (in Romanian)|accessdate= 31 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nTherefore, these German-speaking colonists who were settled by the Austrian Empire in the city proper can trace their origins most notably from present-day southern [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Bohemia]], both Catholics and Protestants.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bukovinasociety.org/buko/sitefiles/Welisch-2002-1.html|author=www.bukovinasociety.org|work=The Bukovina Society of the Americas|title=The History of Bukovina by Dr. Sophie A.

Their cultural and historical legacy is highlighted by a series of well preserved religious buildings that still exist to this today.\n\nThe most representative ecclesiastical landmark established by the local Armenian population is Zamca Monastery (the term Zamca can actually trace its linguistic origin to [[Polish language|Polish]], denoting as such a 'fortified place' and being named this way by [[List of Polish monarchs|King]] [[John III Sobieski|Jan Sobieski]] of [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Poland]] in 1691), a fortified complex of buildings located on a plateau at the western point of the contemporary city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://calatoresc.ro/descopera-orasul-suceava/|author=Isabela|work=c\u0103l\u0103toresc.ro|title=Descoper\u0103 ora\u0219ul Suceava (in Romanian)|date=2 October 2013|accessdate= 28 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nZamca Monastery was constructed between 1551 and 1606 and its church is dedicated to Saint Auxentius. Along with the church, the monastery includes several buildings made of stone and a defensive wall that surrounds the whole medieval complex.\n\nBetween Zamca Monastery and the city center there are two more Armenian Orthodox churches. Church of Saint Simon (also known as The Red Tower Church because of its bell tower) was founded in 1513. The bell tower was constructed in 1551.\n\nThe church has an old Armenian cemetery in the proximity and a chapel that was built in 1902 (Pruncul Chapel). Church of the Holy Cross was established in 1521 and was renovated several times in its history. The Armenian parsonage is located near the church, along with several old tomb stones.\n\nHagigadar Monastery is another medieval complex built by the local Armenians. It was founded in 1512\u20131513, and is located on the south-western proximity of the city, on a valley near [[European route E85]].\n\n==Tourism==\n\nIn the past few years Suceava started to evolve more rapidly.

By far the most significant (and at the same time the most well preserved one) is the Seat Fortress of Suceava ({{lang-ro|Cetatea de Scaun a Sucevei}}) or Suceava Citadel, a medieval castle situated on the eastern edge of the contemporary city.\n\nThe fortress was built during the reign of [[Petru II of Moldavia|Petru of Moldavia]] (1375\u20131391), also known as Petru Mu\u0219at. It was further expanded and strengthened during the reigns of [[Alexander I of Moldavia]] (1400\u20131432) and [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]] (1457\u20131504). The medieval castle was part of the fortification system built in [[Moldavia]] in the late 14th century, because of the emergence of the Ottoman danger. It became strong enough to hold off an attack by Ottoman sultan [[Mehmed II]] (the conqueror of [[Constantinople]]), in 1476.\n\nSuceava was the capital city of the former Principality of Moldavia between 1388 and 1565. During this period, the castle served as princely residence. [[Alexandru L\u0103pu\u0219neanu]] had subsequently moved the Moldavian capital to [[Ia\u0219i]] in 1565, so the castle lost its status. Afterwards, the citadel entered a period of steep decline. In 1675, during the reign of voivode Dumitra\u0219cu Cantacuzino, the fortress was destroyed. Then, for over two centuries, the castle was completely deserted.\n\n[[File:Cetatea de Scaun a Sucevei la ceas de seara.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The late 14th century Moldavian seat fortress as seen during nighttime in May, 2015.]]\n\nIn late 19th century and early 20th century, under the patronage of Austrian architect [[:ro:Karl Romstorfer|Karl Adolf Romstorfer]], a series of rehabilitation works and archaeological research were conducted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dragusanul.ro/romstorfer-vienezul-care-a-indatorat-bucovina/|author=Dragu\u0219anul.ro|work=Dr\u0103gu\u0219anul|title=Romstorfer, vienezul care a \u00eendatorat Bucovina (in Romanian)|accessdate= 8 March 2020}}</ref> Between 1961 and 1970 other restoration and consolidation works were carried out. In 2013, a major reconstruction program was launched, to return the castle to its original architecture and shape.\n\nThe Seat Fortress of Suceava consists of two concentric citadels. The inner citadel, known as ''fortul mu\u0219atin'', has a rectangular shape and a patio. It was built by Petru Mu\u0219at in late 14th century. In the second half of the 15th century, Stephen the Great expanded the structure, by adding another citadel that has a circular shape which surrounds the old one.\n\nAfter 1476, new fortifications were added to the outer citadel. Furthermore, the whole castle is encircled by a large defensive ditch. Today, the fortress is a landmark of Suceava and a noteworthy touristic attraction. Since 2011, it has also been used for hosting cultural events such as the [[rock music]] festival Bucovina Rock Castle. The festival had attracted a series of noteworthy national and international musical acts (e.g. guitarist [[Jan Akkerman]], formerly of Dutch [[progressive rock]] band [[Focus (band)|Focus]]).<ref>[http://www.bucovinarockcastle.ro Bucovina Rock Castle official website (in Romanian)]</ref>\n\n===The Princely Court of Suceava===\n\n[[File:Curtea domneasca din Suceava9.jpg|thumb|left|Present-day ruins of the local Princely Court.]]\n\nThe Princely Court of Suceava ({{lang-ro|Curtea Domneasc\u0103 din Suceava}}) was built and developed related with the Seat Fortress. In late 14th century, voivode Petru Mu\u0219at built the Princely House, a structure made in wood, which included a cellar. After 1400, Alexander I of Moldavia rebuilt the wooden house and added a surrounding wall made of stone and a complex of buildings, also made of stone. In the second half of the 15th century, the Princely Court was severely affected by fire, the wooden house being completely burned out.\n\nDuring his reign, Stephen the Great (1457\u20131504) restored the whole complex. A new Princely House was built, this time made of stone, and the other buildings were extended. [[Vasile Lupu]] (1634\u20131653) was the last ruler of Moldavia who took care of the Princely Court. During his time, the cellars were rehabilitated. The complex was abandoned in late 17th century, the buildings and the walls being gradually dismantled. Currently, on the site of the Princely Court there are only ruins and leftovers of the former buildings.\n\nThe ruins of the former medieval court are located in the city center of Suceava. In the 14th\u201317th centuries, in the proximity of the Princely Court there were built several churches that still exist today and attract tourists.\n\n[[File:Cetatea \u015echeia10.jpg|thumb|right|The ruined walls of the \u0218cheia Fortress on \u0218eptilici Hill.]]\n\n===\u0218cheia Fortress===\n\nOn the north-western edge of the contemporary city, on a hilltop, there is another medieval citadel known as ''\u0218cheia'' Fortress ({{lang-ro|Cetatea \u0218cheia}}) or the Western Fortress of Suceava ({{lang-ro|Cetatea de Apus a Sucevei}}). Unlike the Seat Fortress, ''\u0218cheia'' Fortress has left nothing but some ruined walls. The citadel proper was built during the reign of Petru Mu\u0219at during the late 14th century, but was short-lived, given that it was dismantled during the early 15th century, in the time of [[Alexander I of Moldavia]]. ''\u0218cheia'' Fortress, just like the main Seat Fortress, was part of the fortification system built in medieval Principality of Moldavia during the late 14th century.\n\n===Museums===\n\n[[File:Muzeul Judetean din Suceava7.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The entrance to the Bukovina History Museum. During the [[interwar period]], the building served as Suceava County prefecture.]]\n\nThe first museum in Suceava was opened in 1900, by the initiative of some local intellectuals. In the beginning, the museum included only a few collections that were obtained as a result of the researches and excavation works at the Seat Fortress of Suceava. The museum was expanded and developed over time and became an important cultural institution, currently named [[Bukovina Museum]] ({{lang-ro|Muzeul Bucovinei}}). It has several departments and administers the medieval sites of the Seat Fortress, ''\u0218cheia'' Fortress and the Princely Court, local museums (Bukovina Village Museum, the history, ethnographic, and natural sciences museums), the memorial houses of [[Simion Florea Marian]] in Suceava, [[Nicolae Labi\u0219]] in [[M\u0103lini]], [[:ro:Eusebiu Camilar|Eusebiu Camilar]] in [[Ude\u0219ti]], [[Ciprian Porumbescu]] in [[Ciprian Porumbescu, Suceava|Stupca]], and two traditional houses located in [[Solca]] and [[Bilca]].\n\nThe oldest department of Bukovina Museum is the history museum, which was the backbone for creating a county museum at Suceava. This museum presents the local history of Suceava and Moldavia in the context of Romanian national history. The exhibits of the history museum and the offices of Bukovina Museum are located in a historic building, in the city center. The building, which hosted the prefecture of Suceava County during the interwar period, was built between 1902\u20131903. Since 1968, it houses the history museum. In 2014, the building and the museum entered an extensive program of modernization, rehabilitation, and expansion.\n\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|total_width=300|align=left\n|image1 = Cr\u00e2\u0219ma din \u0218aru Dornei - panoramio.jpg|caption1=Inn from [[Vatra Dornei|Dorna]] ({{lang-de|Dorna Watra}}) ethnographic area, exhibited at Bukovina Village Museum\n|image2 = Casa Vicovu de Jos1.jpg|caption2=Traditional household from [[Vicovu de Jos]] ({{lang-de|Unter Wikow}})\n|image3 = Gospod\u0103ria Straja6.jpg|caption3=Traditional household from [[Straja, Suceava|Straja]] ({{lang-de|Strasza}})\n|image4 = Moara din M\u0103n\u0103stirea Humorului.jpg|caption4=Windmill from [[M\u0103n\u0103stirea Humorului]] ({{lang-de|Humora Kloster}})\n}}\n\nAt the history museum there is a reconstitution of a scene from the former throne hall located in the Seat Fortress.

It is located in the eastern part of Suceava, near the Seat Fortress. It was founded in the 1970s, but its major expansion and development took place after 1990. The museum is designed as a traditional village in Bukovina, containing houses and various objectives from the ethnographic areas of [[R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi]], [[Gura Humorului|Humor]], [[C\u00e2mpulung Moldovenesc]], [[Vatra Dornei|Dorna]], and [[F\u0103lticeni]].\n\nThe museum includes among others a water mill from [[M\u0103n\u0103stirea Humorului]], a traditional blacksmith workshop, a pottery workshop from [[Marginea]] and one of the many old wooden churches in northern Moldavia: Church of the Ascension, a Romanian Orthodox wooden church built in 1783 in [[Vama, Suceava|Vama]], a village in [[Suceava County]].

It was opened in 1968 and includes old collections and exhibits that are housed in a medieval inn located in the center of Suceava, known as the Princely Inn of Suceava ({{lang-ro|Hanul Domnesc din Suceava}}). This landmark dates from the late 16th and early 17th century. It was built of stone and has two floors and a cellar. During the Austrian rule (1775\u20131918), the inn operated as a hunting lodge for the imperial family. Since 1968, it hosts the ethnographic museum.

In the city centre there's also a statue dedicated to [[Petru Mu\u0219at]], Prince of Moldavia between 1375\u20131391.\n\n===Religious buildings===\n\n====Romanian Orthodox churches====\n\nOne of the most important cultural sites in Suceava is [[Saint John the New Monastery]] which includes the monumental Church of [[Saint George]], built between 1514 and 1522. The construction began during the reign of voivode [[Bogdan III the One-Eyed]] of Moldavia, after the nearby Mir\u0103u\u021bi Church (the metropolitan cathedral of Moldavia at that moment) was devastated in 1513. The construction was completed by [[Stephen IV of Moldavia]] (also known as \u0218tef\u0103ni\u021b\u0103). The monastery church served as metropolitan cathedral of Moldavia until 1677. It has frescoes painted on the outside, typical of the region, and is one of eight buildings that make up the [[churches of Moldavia]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/598 Churches of Moldavia] at the UNESCO site</ref> Since 1991 Saint John the New Monastery serves as the cathedral of the [[Archdiocese of Suceava and R\u0103d\u0103u\u021bi]].

[[Alexander I of Moldavia]] brought his relics to Suceava in 1402.\n\nMir\u0103u\u021bi Church, dedicated to Saint George, is the oldest religious building in Suceava, founded by [[Petru II of Moldavia]] in late 14th century, in the same period with the Seat Fortress, when he moved the capital from [[Siret]] to Suceava. The church established the city as a see of it. Mir\u0103u\u021bi was the metropolitan cathedral of Moldavia between 1402 and 1522, when the church of Saint John the New Monastery was completed. In 1402, the relics of Saint John the New were transferred to this church from [[Cetatea Alb\u0103]], and then, in 1589 transferred again to the nearby monastery church by voivode [[Peter the Lame]]. The name ''Mir\u0103u\u021bi'' derives from the fact that it was the coronation church of Moldavia until 1522. [[Stephen the Great]] was crowned in here in 1457. After the church was devastated, it was rebuilt in early 17th century, and then, in the 18th century, abandoned.\n\nChurch of [[Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki|Saint Demetrius]] was founded by [[Peter IV Rare\u0219]], ruler of Moldavia (1527\u20131538, 1541\u20131546), and the son of Stephan the Great. The church was built in 1534\u20131535, with a bell tower added in 1560\u20131561 by Alexandru L\u0103pu\u0219neanu. The bell tower is 40 meters high, being the tallest bell tower in Suceava and a landmark of the city. The church had frescoes painted on the outside, that are still visible on one side wall. The frescoes inside were restored recently. Church of Saint Demetrius is located near the ruins of the former Princely Court of Suceava.\n\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=300\n| image1 = M\u0103n\u0103stirea Sf\u00e2ntul Ioan cel Nou35.jpg\n| image2 = Biserica Sf.

Church of [[Saint John the Baptist]], also known as Coconilor Church or Domni\u021belor Church, was founded in 1643 by [[Vasile Lupu]], voivode of Moldavia between 1632 and 1653. It has no exterior frescoes and a short bell tower that has its roof linked with the roof above the church. In its early days, the church functioned as a chapel for the Princely Court.\n\nChurch of the Resurrection (located in the proximity of Saint John the New Monastery) dates from 1551, and was founded by Elena Rare\u0219, the wife of voivode Peter IV Rare\u0219. The church has no tower above the [[cella|naos]], its architecture reflecting the urban style of the medieval period. Instead of the bell tower, the church has a [[zvonnitsa]], an architectural form especially used in the [[Russian architecture]] of the 14th\u201317th centuries. Church of the Resurrection was used by the local Roman Catholic community during the Habsburg occupation, and then by the Ruthenian Greek Catholic community, until 1936. It is also known as ''V\u0103scresenia Church'' or ''Elena Doamna'' Church.\n\nChurch of [[Saint Nicholas]] (Pr\u0103jescu) is another religious building in Suceava that features the medieval Moldavian architectural style. The present church was rebuilt by treasurer Nicoar\u0103 Pr\u0103jescu in 1611, during the reign of Constantin Movil\u0103 (1607\u20131611). Throughout its history, the church functioned as a necropolis for the local [[boyar]]s.\n\nBetween the city center and I\u021bcani neighborhood, on the slopes that descend to the [[Suceava (river)|Suceava river valley]], there is Church of the Assumption, another old Romanian Orthodox church, founded in the first half of the 17th century (1639). The church was built on the place where I\u021bcani Monastery existed before. It functioned as a nunnery until late 18th century. Today it is parish church, and has a zvonnitsa similar to that of Church of the Resurrection, located downtown.\n\nIn Burdujeni neighborhood, {{convert|4|km|0|abbr=on}} north-east of the city center, there is Teodoreni Monastery, founded in 1597 by local boyar Teodor Movil\u0103, the elder brother of [[Ieremia Movil\u0103]], ruler of Moldavia (1595\u20131600, 1600\u20131606). Burdujeni village (now a district of Suceava) was established and developed around this monastery. The set of buildings includes Church of Ascension, the bell tower, living quarters for nuns and a surrounding wall. Just {{convert|1|km|1|abbr=on}} north of Teodoreni Monastery, in the old district of Burdujeni, there is Church of the Holy Trinity, founded by archimandrite Filaret Scriban in 1851.\n\nI\u021bcani neighborhood has two Romanian Orthodox churches founded in the first half of the 20th century: Church of the Holy Archangels (built near [[Suceava North railway station]], in 1933\u20131938) and Church of the Holy Apostles (located on [[European route E85]] and built in 1905\u20131908 by the German community of I\u021bcani, initially as a Lutheran church).\n\n[[Church of the Holy Cross, P\u0103tr\u0103u\u021bi|Church of the Holy Cross]], located in [[P\u0103tr\u0103u\u021bi]] village (a few miles north-west of I\u021bcani), was founded in 1487 by Stephen the Great, and is one of the monuments that make up the [[churches of Moldavia]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. Also not far away from I\u021bcani, there is [[Dragomirna Monastery]], established by clergyman [[Anastasie Crimca]] in 1609. [[Vorone\u021b Monastery]] is located {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=on}} west of Suceava, in the town of [[Gura Humorului]].\n\n====German Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches====\n\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=200\n| image1 = Biserica Sf.

Church of Saint Simon (also known as The Red Tower Church because of its bell tower) was founded in 1513. The bell tower was constructed in 1551.\n\nThe church has an old Armenian cemetery in the proximity and a chapel that was built in 1902 (Pruncul Chapel). Church of the Holy Cross was established in 1521 and was renovated several times in its history. The Armenian parsonage is located near the church, along with several old tomb stones.\n\nHagigadar Monastery is another medieval complex built by the local Armenians.

On 5 February 2003, the government created CADIVI, a currency control board charged with handling foreign exchange procedures. Its creation was to control [[capital flight]] by placing limits on individuals and only offering them so much of a foreign currency.<ref>[http://www.cadivi.gov.ve/cadivi/cadivi.html CADIVI, una medidia necesaria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205143924/http://www.cadivi.gov.ve/cadivi/cadivi.html |date=5 December 2008 }}</ref> This limit to foreign currency led to a creation of a currency [[black market]] economy since Venezuelan merchants rely on foreign goods that require payments with reliable foreign currencies.

On 5 February 2003, the government created CADIVI, a currency control board charged with handling foreign exchange procedures. Its creation was to control [[capital flight]] by placing limits on individuals and only offering them so much of a foreign currency.<ref>[http://www.cadivi.gov.ve/cadivi/cadivi.html CADIVI, una medidia necesaria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205143924/http://www.cadivi.gov.ve/cadivi/cadivi.html |date=5 December 2008 }}</ref> This limit to foreign currency led to a creation of a currency [[black market]] economy since Venezuelan merchants rely on foreign goods that require payments with reliable foreign currencies.

{"title_page": "Connotation (semiotics)", "text_new": "{{no footnotes|date=May 2019}}\n:''This word has distinct meanings in logic, philosophy, and common usage.  See [[connotation]].''\n{{Semiotics}}\nIn [[semiotics]], '''connotation''' arises when the [[Denotation (semiotics)|denotative]] relationship between a signifier and its signified is inadequate to serve the needs of the [[community]]. A second level of [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]]s is termed connotative. These meanings are not [[object (philosophy)|objective]] representations of the ''thing'', but new usages produced by the language group.\n\n==Discussion==\nDrawing from the original definition proposed by [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]] (1857\u20131913), a [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] has two parts:\n*as a signifier, i.e. it will have a form that a person can see, touch, smell, or hear, and\n*as the signified, i.e. it will represent an idea or mental construct of a thing rather than the thing itself. \nConnotative meanings are developed by the community and do not represent the inherent qualities of the thing or [[concept]] originally signified as the meaning. The addition of such meanings introduces complexity into the [[code (semiotics)|coding]] system. If a signifier has only a single denotational meaning, the use of the sign will always be unambiguously decoded by the [[audience]]. But connotative meanings are context-dependent, i.e. the addresser must  learn how to match the meaning intended by the addresser to one of the various possible meanings held in [[memory]]. \n\nThe power of connotation is that it enables the addresser to more easily consider [[abstraction|abstract]] concepts and to introduce subtlety into the [[discourse]]. For example, a digital [[thermometer]] produces a numerical value that indicates the current state of a specific operational parameter. This technology provides an ''indexical'' sign of [[heat]] (adopting the classification of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839\u20131914), an indexical sign by real connection between the signifier and the signified). The number is a denotative value, i.e. it speaks only for itself. The doctor, nurse or patient will relate to the number as a visual [[Trope (linguistics)|trope]], in this case a [[metaphor]], for the health of the body. Such [[information]] adds to other [[data]] forming a symptomology for the patient, a summation that takes place at a connotative [[cognitive]] level. Hence, the meanings as to health or illness are selected from the connotational framework which the interpreter has constructed through training and experience given that each possible state of well-being is represented by a cluster of [[symbol]]ic attributes, one of which is the patient's temperature. lel god is amazin ;)\n\n\nConnotation is concerned with how the sign system is used in each message. The [[semantic]] content is selected by the addresser and represents that individual's [[value (semiotics)|values]] and intentions. Limiting an analysis purely to the sign system comprised by [[paradigm]]s and [[syntagm]]s excludes key elements in the interpretive process. Thus, [[subject (philosophy)|subjective]] tests such as the [[commutation test]] have been developed to map connotations and so decode more of the addresser's intentions. This is achieved by changing the form of the signifiers, by substituting signifiers to assess what the alternative connotations would be and by considering what signifiers are absent and why their absences might be significant. Changes of form would require substituting different [[typeface|font]]s for the same text, or different colours or designs for the same visual content. The use of [[synonym]]s and [[antonym]]s clarifies connotational choices as between, say, [[pejorative]] and [[euphemistic]] usages. As to absences, if a modern image of a group of people employed in a major public enterprise only contains individuals of the same gender and ethnicity, the analyst would enquire into the significance of the exclusion of those of the opposite gender and a different ethnicity. The editorial decision may be supporting social values, attitudes and beliefs that are embedded into the culture\u2014for example, that nations ought to conscript only men to serve on the front-lines of a war. Other explanations of different contexts may expose cultural [[mythology|myth]]s and [[prejudice]]s which are less reasonable.\n\n==References==\n*Barthes, Roland. ''Elements of Semiology'' (trans.
