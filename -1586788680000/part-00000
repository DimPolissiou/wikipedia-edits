It was a 1961 Top Five hit for the [[pop music|pop]] girl group [[the Paris Sisters]], which inaugurated a string of elaborately produced classic hits by [[Phil Spector]]. [[Bobby Vinton]] had a Top Ten hit in 1968 with a cover version. The song has been recorded by many other artists over the years.\n\n==The Paris Sisters version==\n\n===Background===\n[[The Paris Sisters]] recorded \"I Love How You Love Me\" at [[Gold Star Studios]] in the autumn of 1961 with [[Phil Spector]] as their producer. The group vocalized repeatedly to a piano accompaniment until Spector was satisfied with the balance between the voices, after which a string arrangement which Spector worked on over several days with Hank Levine was added.<ref name=\"Wall of Sound\">{{cite book|first=Mick|last=Brown|year=2007|title=Tearing Down the Wall of Sound: the rise and fall of Phil Spector|edition=1st US|publisher=Alfred A.

Then finally when the record was pressed he listened to the pressing for another two or three days before he gave it an approval.\"<ref name=\"Wall of Sound\"/>\n\nSpector's interest in the song was occasioned by its structural similarity to \"[[To Know Him Is to Love Him]]\", the No. 1 hit that Spector's group, [[the Teddy Bears]], had scored in 1958. [[Carol Connors (singer)|Annette Kleinbard]] who had been the Teddy Bears' vocalist, would weep upon hearing The Paris Sisters' \"I Love How You Love Me\" on her car radio: \"Before [Priscilla Paris] sung five words I knew it was Phil's record...it was just the most beautiful record, but I loved it and I hated it at the same time; it felt like Phil had taken my voice and passed it on to someone else\".<ref name=\"Wall of Sound\"/> However Priscilla Paris would opine: \"My sound was not like Annette's - she had a very thin type of little girl voice. I have a heavy roque - that's a French word meaning very heavy, husky - voice. I think Phil fell into something he wanted to do, added extra ingredients, and ended up with something different.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spectropop.com/ParisSisters/index.htm|title=The Paris Sisters|last=Greig|first=Charlotte|publisher=Spectropop|accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref>\n\n\"I Love How You Love Me\" was originally intended for [[Tony Orlando]], to be arranged in the same upbeat style as Orlando's precedent hits \"Bless You\" and \"Halfway to Paradise\".<sup>1</sup>  The song was written by [[Barry Mann]] and Larry Kolber (aka Kolberg) who were staff writers at [[Don Kirshner]]'s Aldon Music near the [[Brill Building]]. Kolber had written the lyrics on a restaurant napkin within five minutes. When [[Phil Spector]] discovered the song on a visit to Kirshner's Aldon offices he persuaded Kirshner that the song would have more potential if rendered by a female act. Spector then recorded \"I Love How You Love Me\" with The Paris Sisters.\n\nEntering the Top 40 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in October 1961, \"I Love How You Love Me\" reached No. 5 that November.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits: Eighth Edition|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|authorlink=Joel Whitburn|year=2004|publisher=Record Research|page=480}}</ref>\n\n''Billboard'' named the song #100 on their list of 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time.<ref>{{cite web|title=100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time: Critics' Picks|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7857816/100-greatest-girl-group-songs|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe song was used in episode 5 of the 2017 ''[[Twin Peaks (2017 TV series)|Twin Peaks]]'' continuation.\n\n==Bobby Vinton version==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = I Love How You Love Me\n| cover      = I Love How You Love Me.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Bobby Vinton]]\n| album      = [[I Love How You Love Me (album)|I Love How You Love Me]]\n| B-side     = Little Barefoot Boy\n| released   = October 1968\n| format     = 7\" single\n| recorded   =\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = [[Pop music|Pop]]\n| length     =\n| label      = [[Epic Records|Epic]]\n| writer     = {{plainlist}}\n* [[Barry Mann]]\n* Larry Kolber\n{{endplainlist}}\n| producer   = [[Billy Sherrill]]\n| prev_title = [[Halfway to Paradise]]\n| prev_year  = 1968\n| next_title = To Know You Is to Love You\n| next_year  = 1969\n}}\n\n===Background===\n[[Bobby Vinton]] made a comeback in the late 1960s when producer [[Billy Sherrill]] had him remake songs which had been hits a few years previous.

It was a 1961 Top Five hit for the [[pop music|pop]] girl group [[the Paris Sisters]], which inaugurated a string of elaborately produced classic hits by [[Phil Spector]]. [[Bobby Vinton]] had a Top Ten hit in 1968 with a cover version. The song has been recorded by many other artists over the years.\n\n==The Paris Sisters version==\n\n===Background===\n[[The Paris Sisters]] recorded \"I Love How You Love Me\" at [[Gold Star Studios]] in the autumn of 1961 with [[Phil Spector]] as their producer. The group vocalized repeatedly to a piano accompaniment until Spector was satisfied with the balance between the voices, after which a string arrangement which Spector worked on over several days with Hank Levine was added.<ref name=\"Wall of Sound\">{{cite book|first=Mick|last=Brown|year=2007|title=Tearing Down the Wall of Sound: the rise and fall of Phil Spector|edition=1st US|publisher=Alfred A.

Then finally when the record was pressed he listened to the pressing for another two or three days before he gave it an approval.\"<ref name=\"Wall of Sound\"/>\n\nSpector's interest in the song was occasioned by its structural similarity to \"[[To Know Him Is to Love Him]]\", the No. 1 hit that Spector's group, [[the Teddy Bears]], had scored in 1958. [[Carol Connors (singer)|Annette Kleinbard]] who had been the Teddy Bears' vocalist, would weep upon hearing The Paris Sisters' \"I Love How You Love Me\" on her car radio: \"Before [Priscilla Paris] sung five words I knew it was Phil's record...it was just the most beautiful record, but I loved it and I hated it at the same time; it felt like Phil had taken my voice and passed it on to someone else\".<ref name=\"Wall of Sound\"/> However Priscilla Paris would opine: \"My sound was not like Annette's - she had a very thin type of little girl voice. I have a heavy roque - that's a French word meaning very heavy, husky - voice. I think Phil fell into something he wanted to do, added extra ingredients, and ended up with something different.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spectropop.com/ParisSisters/index.htm|title=The Paris Sisters|last=Greig|first=Charlotte|publisher=Spectropop|accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref>\n\n\"I Love How You Love Me\" was originally intended for [[Tony Orlando]], to be arranged in the same upbeat style as Orlando's precedent hits \"Bless You\" and \"Halfway to Paradise\".<sup>1</sup>  The song was written by [[Barry Mann]] and Larry Kolber (aka Kolberg) who were staff writers at [[Don Kirshner]]'s Aldon Music near the [[Brill Building]]. Kolber had written the lyrics on a restaurant napkin within five minutes. When [[Phil Spector]] discovered the song on a visit to Kirshner's Aldon offices he persuaded Kirshner that the song would have more potential if rendered by a female act. Spector then recorded \"I Love How You Love Me\" with The Paris Sisters.\n\nEntering the Top 40 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in October 1961, \"I Love How You Love Me\" reached No. 5 that November.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits: Eighth Edition|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|authorlink=Joel Whitburn|year=2004|publisher=Record Research|page=480}}</ref>\n\n''Billboard'' named the song #100 on their list of 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time.<ref>{{cite web|title=100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time: Critics' Picks|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7857816/100-greatest-girl-group-songs|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe song was used in episode 5 of the 2017 ''[[Twin Peaks (2017 TV series)|Twin Peaks]]'' continuation.\n\n==Bobby Vinton version==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = I Love How You Love Me\n| cover      = I Love How You Love Me.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Bobby Vinton]]\n| album      = [[I Love How You Love Me (album)|I Love How You Love Me]]\n| B-side     = Little Barefoot Boy\n| released   = October 1968\n| format     = 7\" single\n| recorded   =\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = [[Pop music|Pop]]\n| length     =\n| label      = [[Epic Records|Epic]]\n| writer     = {{plainlist}}\n* [[Barry Mann]]\n* Larry Kolber\n{{endplainlist}}\n| producer   = [[Billy Sherrill]]\n| prev_title = [[Halfway to Paradise]]\n| prev_year  = 1968\n| next_title = To Know You Is to Love You\n| next_year  = 1969\n}}\n\n===Background===\n[[Bobby Vinton]] made a comeback in the late 1960s when producer [[Billy Sherrill]] had him remake songs which had been hits a few years previous.
