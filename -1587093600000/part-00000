This left them seven points behind United, with two games to go, confirming the Manchester club as champions once more.\n\nThe three relegation spots were occupied by [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] and [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] who each lasted one season in the league, along with [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] who went down after seven seasons.\n\n==Teams==\nTwenty teams competed in the league&nbsp;\u2013 the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the [[2005\u201306 Football League Championship|Championship]]. The promoted teams were [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] (playing in the top flight for the first time ever), [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] (playing top flight football for the first time in twelve years) and [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] (returning after a six-year absence). They replaced [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]], [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] and [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], ending their top flight spells of four, two and one year respectively.\n\n===Stadiums and locations===\n{{location map+ |England |width=440 |float=right |caption=Locations of the 2006\u201307 Premier League teams |places=\n{{location map~ |England

Image taken on November 27th, 2018.]]\n\n==Overview==\nDesigned in 1852 by Alexander Jackson Davis, one of the preeminent American architects of the nineteenth century, the house was sited to take full advantage of the dramatic views of the water. Davis\u2019 original plan envisioned the family sitting on the villa's front porch and looking out over the spectacular scenery. The beauty of the house and its site were accented by the progression of the entry drive. The visitor originally entered the property from the north along a private road. The curving drive ascended toward the house, proceeding toward Echo Bay and curving around to the front door. The family who first commissioned the design was one Cyrus Lawton, a close friend of Mr. Davis. Mrs. Lawton was a member of the prominent Davenport family, for whom the entire area is named, and the house was a wedding gift to the couple.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D00E2D6103DEE32A25754C0A9639C946397D6CF Cyrus Lawton Obituary], ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref>\n\nWildcliff was erected in the early 1850s, during a period when New Rochelle was beginning its transformation from a rural farming community into a residential suburb. Improvements in transportation permitted affluent families to build homes in New Rochelle and commute to work in nearby New York City. The land along the scenic north shore of [[Long Island Sound]] was especially sought after and many of Davis' designs were built here. His smaller homes were called \"''cottages''\", and the more substantial ones \"''villas''\", however the terms were frequently combined. Among their typical features were prominent, steep-roofed [[gable]]s, with elaborately carved [[bargeboard]]s under their [[eaves]].<ref>A. J. Davis and the Gothic Revival, Edna Donnell, Metropolitan Museum Studies, Vol. 5, No. 2 (Sep., 1936)</ref> Wildcliff is one of two \"''cottage-villas''\" built by Davis on New Rochelle's waterfront peninsula, [[Davenport Neck (New York)|Davenport Neck]], the other being [[Davenport House (New Rochelle, New York)|\"Sans Souci\"]] (or Davenport House).<ref>[http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=101366 National Register of Historic Places Registration Form], section 8, page 2</ref>\n\nAfter Cyrus Lawton's death in 1902, the property was inherited by his son Newberry Lawton Davenport. It was later purchased by Julius and Clara Prince who moved into the home in 1914. Clara Prince donated Wildcliff to the City of New Rochelle in 1940 with the hopes that it would be used as a natural [[science museum]].<ref>\"Wildcliff Youth Museum\", manuscript printed by the City of New Rochelle, in collection of New Rochelle Public Library (New Rochelle Museums - Wildcliff File)</ref> Clara Prince's obituary, \"Mrs. Julius Prince\", ''The New York Times'', September 14, 1941, page 49, notes that she was a \"philanthropist who had given generously to educational projects\" and that she was especially known for the donation of Wildcliff to New Rochelle in 1940, ten years after the city had tried in vain to purchase the property. It has since been used for a variety of purposes including a youth museum and [[performing arts center]].<ref>[http://noambramson.org/publicdocs/2008-10/Preserver.pdf The Preserver - Highlighting New Rochelle's Rich Past]</ref> Around 1970 a wing housing a theater was added at one corner of the house but the main structure remains intact.<ref>[http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=101366 National Register of Historic Places Registration Form], section 8, page 7</ref>\n\nSince late 2010, the local organization Jen's Community at Wildcliff has been working with the City of New Rochelle and its citizens to bring awareness to the building and to create a [[preschool]] and education center.<ref name=\"JCW\">[http://www.jenscommunityatwildcliff.org Jen's Community at Wildcliff]></ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Wildcliff, 42 Wildcliff Rd., New Rochelle, Westchester County, New York..JPG|thumb|right|detail]]\nWildcliff is a 2\u00bd-story house faced primarily in rubblestone of various colors. These stones give the picturesque design a natural quality, as if the building were rising out of the landscape. For a house in the Northeast, Downing prescribed a design with high roofs, thick walls, warm rooms, and chimneys. The original front facade of the building was on the southern portion of the present house facing Long Island Sound, now partially obscured by the out-of-character one story addition used as a theater. This facade originally had a 2\u00bd-story central gable with a pair of windows on the first\nstory looking out over the water. In the mid 1860s, Davis designed additions to the house in the same style with special efforts made so that the changes would be as inconspicuous as possible. Bargeboards and other ornamental details match exactly and stonework was laid so that there would be no sign of the joint between the old and new sections.<ref>[http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=101366 National Register of Historic Places Registration Form], section 8, page 7</ref><ref name=Hershenson>Roberta Hershenson, [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/26/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/26wethea.html Vision Takes On Reality as Group Inches Closer to a Stage of Its Own], The New York Times, March 26, 2006</ref><ref name=grant>[http://nysparks.state.ny.us/news/press/view.asp?pressID=573 2006 EPF Grant Awards], Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, October 20, 2006</ref><ref name=\"regform\">{{cite web|author=Andrew S.

To the south is the original library and entrance hall, now combined into one space. On the upper floors are bedrooms with steeply sloping walls reflecting their locations within the gables. The attic retains some original floorboards and four paneled doors with original knobs. The interior retains much of its historic plan and some historic fittings, but much of the interior detail has been lost.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commonscat|Wildcliff (New Rochelle, New York)}}\n* Davis, Alexander Jackson, ''Day Book'' vol. 2, October 1853 - December 1869 (collection Columbia University, Avery Library)\n* Davis, Alexander Jackson, ''Diary''' [Journal] (collection Metropolitan Museum of Art, Department of Prints and Drawings)\n* Peck, Amelia, ed., ''Alexander Jackson Davis: American Architect 1803 - 1892''.

Image taken on November 27th, 2018.]]\n\n==Overview==\nDesigned in 1852 by Alexander Jackson Davis, one of the preeminent American architects of the nineteenth century, the house was sited to take full advantage of the dramatic views of the water. Davis\u2019 original plan envisioned the family sitting on the villa's front porch and looking out over the spectacular scenery. The beauty of the house and its site were accented by the progression of the entry drive. The visitor originally entered the property from the north along a private road. The curving drive ascended toward the house, proceeding toward Echo Bay and curving around to the front door. The family who first commissioned the design was one Cyrus Lawton, a close friend of Mr. Davis. Mrs. Lawton was a member of the prominent Davenport family, for whom the entire area is named, and the house was a wedding gift to the couple.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D00E2D6103DEE32A25754C0A9639C946397D6CF Cyrus Lawton Obituary], ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref>\n\nWildcliff was erected in the early 1850s, during a period when New Rochelle was beginning its transformation from a rural farming community into a residential suburb. Improvements in transportation permitted affluent families to build homes in New Rochelle and commute to work in nearby New York City. The land along the scenic north shore of [[Long Island Sound]] was especially sought after and many of Davis' designs were built here. His smaller homes were called \"''cottages''\", and the more substantial ones \"''villas''\", however the terms were frequently combined. Among their typical features were prominent, steep-roofed [[gable]]s, with elaborately carved [[bargeboard]]s under their [[eaves]].<ref>A. J. Davis and the Gothic Revival, Edna Donnell, Metropolitan Museum Studies, Vol. 5, No. 2 (Sep., 1936)</ref> Wildcliff is one of two \"''cottage-villas''\" built by Davis on New Rochelle's waterfront peninsula, [[Davenport Neck (New York)|Davenport Neck]], the other being [[Davenport House (New Rochelle, New York)|\"Sans Souci\"]] (or Davenport House).<ref>[http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=101366 National Register of Historic Places Registration Form], section 8, page 2</ref>\n\nAfter Cyrus Lawton's death in 1902, the property was inherited by his son Newberry Lawton Davenport. It was later purchased by Julius and Clara Prince who moved into the home in 1914. Clara Prince donated Wildcliff to the City of New Rochelle in 1940 with the hopes that it would be used as a natural [[science museum]].<ref>\"Wildcliff Youth Museum\", manuscript printed by the City of New Rochelle, in collection of New Rochelle Public Library (New Rochelle Museums - Wildcliff File)</ref> Clara Prince's obituary, \"Mrs. Julius Prince\", ''The New York Times'', September 14, 1941, page 49, notes that she was a \"philanthropist who had given generously to educational projects\" and that she was especially known for the donation of Wildcliff to New Rochelle in 1940, ten years after the city had tried in vain to purchase the property. It has since been used for a variety of purposes including a youth museum and [[performing arts center]].<ref>[http://noambramson.org/publicdocs/2008-10/Preserver.pdf The Preserver - Highlighting New Rochelle's Rich Past]</ref> Around 1970 a wing housing a theater was added at one corner of the house but the main structure remains intact.<ref>[http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=101366 National Register of Historic Places Registration Form], section 8, page 7</ref>\n\nSince late 2010, the local organization Jen's Community at Wildcliff has been working with the City of New Rochelle and its citizens to bring awareness to the building and to create a [[preschool]] and education center.<ref name=\"JCW\">[http://www.jenscommunityatwildcliff.org Jen's Community at Wildcliff]></ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Wildcliff, 42 Wildcliff Rd., New Rochelle, Westchester County, New York..JPG|thumb|right|detail]]\nWildcliff is a 2\u00bd-story house faced primarily in rubblestone of various colors. These stones give the picturesque design a natural quality, as if the building were rising out of the landscape. For a house in the Northeast, Downing prescribed a design with high roofs, thick walls, warm rooms, and chimneys. The original front fa\u00e7ade of the building was on the southern portion of the present house facing Long Island Sound, now partially obscured by the out-of-character one story addition used as a theater. This facade originally had a 2\u00bd-story central gable with a pair of windows on the first\nstory looking out over the water. In the mid 1860s Davis designed additions to the house in the same style with special efforts made so that the changes would be as inconspicuous as possible. Bargeboards and other ornamental details match exactly and stonework was laid so that there would be no sign of the joint between the old and new sections.<ref>[http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=101366 National Register of Historic Places Registration Form], section 8, page 7</ref><ref name=Hershenson>Roberta Hershenson, [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/26/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/26wethea.html Vision Takes On Reality as Group Inches Closer to a Stage of Its Own], The New York Times, March 26, 2006</ref><ref name=grant>[http://nysparks.state.ny.us/news/press/view.asp?pressID=573 2006 EPF Grant Awards], Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, October 20, 2006</ref><ref name=\"regform\">{{cite web|author=Andrew S.

The additions consisted of the construction of a [[porte-cochere]], a new entrance on the south facade of the home, and the conversion of the original entrance into a long, twelve-part window.<ref>[http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=101366 National Register of Historic Places Registration Form], section 8, page 6</ref>\n \nThe original plan of the house can still be read on the interior. To the south is the original library and entrance hall, now combined into one space. On the upper floors are bedrooms with steeply sloping walls reflecting their locations within the gables. The attic retains some original floorboards and four paneled doors with original knobs. The interior retains much of its historic plan and some historic fittings, but much of the interior detail has been lost.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commonscat|Wildcliff (New Rochelle, New York)}}\n* Davis, Alexander Jackson, ''Day Book'' vol. 2, October 1853 - December 1869 (collection Columbia University, Avery Library)\n* Davis, Alexander Jackson, ''Diary''' [Journal] (collection Metropolitan Museum of Art, Department of Prints and Drawings)\n* Peck, Amelia, ed., ''Alexander Jackson Davis: American Architect 1803 - 1892''.

In the first year of Allende's term, the short-term economic results of Minister of the Economy [[Pedro Vuskovic]]'s expansive monetary policy were highly favorable: 12% industrial growth and an 8.6% increase in GDP, accompanied by major declines in inflation (down from 34.9% to 22.1%) and unemployment (down to 3.8%).

Based on the [[Viable system model|experimental viable system model]] and the [[neural network]] approach to organizational design, the Project consisted of four modules: a network of [[telex]] machines (''Cybernet'') in all state-run enterprises that would transmit and receive information with the government in [[Santiago]]. Information from the field would be fed into statistical modeling software (''Cyberstride'') that would monitor production indicators, such as raw material supplies or high rates of worker absenteeism, in \"almost\" real time, alerting the workers in the first case and, in abnormal situations, if those parameters fell outside acceptable ranges by a very large degree, also the central government. The information would also be input into an economic simulation software (''CHECO'', for ''CHilean ECOnomic simulator'') which featured a [[Recursive Bayesian estimation|Bayesian filtering and control setting]] that the government could use to forecast the possible outcome of economic decisions.

Other than the inevitable damage to the economy, the chief effect of the 24-day strike was to induce Allende to bring the head of the army, general [[Carlos Prats]], into the government as Interior Minister.<ref name=icarito-comienzan /> Allende also instructed the government to begin requisitioning trucks to keep the nation from coming to a halt. Government supporters also helped to mobilize trucks and buses but violence served as a deterrent to full mobilization, even with police protection for the strike-breakers.

The Christian Democrats (who had campaigned on a socialist platform in the 1970 elections, but drifted away from those positions during Allende's presidency, eventually forming a coalition with the [[National Party (Partido Nacional--PN)|National Party]]) {{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}, continued to accuse Allende of leading Chile toward a Cuban-style dictatorship, and sought to overturn many of his more radical policies.

Since many North Americans were living in the region, they were focusing in recruiting agents from the United States.

On 9 August, President Allende appointed General [[Carlos Prats]] as [[Ministry of National Defense (Chile)|Minister of Defence]]. On 24 August 1973, General Prats was forced to resign both as defense minister and as the [[Chilean Army|commander-in-chief of the army]], embarrassed by both the [[Alejandrina Cox incident]] and a public protest in front of his house by the wives of his generals. General [[Augusto Pinochet]] replaced him as Army commander-in-chief the same day.<ref name=\"Se desata la crisis\" />\n\n=== Supreme Court's resolution ===\nOn 26 May 1973, the [[Supreme Court of Chile]] unanimously denounced the Allende government's disruption of the legality of the nation in its failure to uphold judicial decisions, because of its continual refusal to permit police execution of judicial decisions contrary to the government's own measures.\n\n=== Chamber of Deputies' resolution ===\nOn 22 August 1973, the Christian Democrats and the National Party members of the Chamber of Deputies joined together to vote 81 to 47 in favor of a resolution that asked the authorities to \"put an immediate end\" to \"breach[es of] the Constitution\u2026with the goal of redirecting government activity toward the path of law and ensuring the Constitutional order of our Nation, and the essential underpinnings of democratic co-existence among Chileans.\"\n\nThe resolution declared that Allende's government sought \"to conquer absolute power with the obvious purpose of subjecting all citizens to the strictest political and economic control by the State... [with] the goal of establishing... a totalitarian system\" and claimed that the government had made \"violations of the Constitution... a permanent system of conduct.\" Essentially, most of the accusations were about disregard by the Socialist government of the separation of powers, and arrogating legislative and judicial prerogatives to the executive branch of government.\n\nSpecifically, the Socialist government of President Allende was accused of:\n* [[Rule by decree|Ruling by decree]], thwarting the normal legislative system\n* Refusing to enforce judicial decisions against its partisans; not carrying out sentences and judicial resolutions that contravened its objectives\n* Ignoring the decrees of the independent General Comptroller's Office\n* Sundry media offenses; usurping control of the National Television Network and applying economic pressure against those media organizations that are not unconditional supporters of the government\n* Allowing its Socialist supporters to assemble with arms, and preventing the same by its right-wing opponents\n* Supporting more than 1,500 illegal takeovers of farms\n* Illegal repression of the [[El Teniente]] miners' strike\n* Illegally limiting emigration\n\nFinally, the resolution condemned the creation and development of government-protected [socialist] armed groups, which were said to be \"headed towards a confrontation with the armed forces\". President Allende's efforts to re-organize the military and the police forces were characterized as \"notorious attempts to use the armed and police forces for partisan ends, destroy their institutional hierarchy, and politically infiltrate their ranks\".<ref>[[s:Agreement of the Chamber of Deputies of Chile|English translation]] on Wikisource.</ref>\n\n=== Allende's response ===\nTwo days later, on 24 August 1973, Allende responded, characterising the Congress's declaration as \"destined to damage the country's prestige abroad and create internal confusion\", predicting \"It will facilitate the seditious intention of certain sectors.\" He noted that the declaration (passed 81\u201347 in the Chamber of Deputies) had not obtained the two-thirds Senate majority \"constitutionally required\" to convict the president of [[abuse of power]]: essentially, the Congress were \"invoking the intervention of the armed forces and of Order against a democratically-elected government\" and \"subordinat[ing] political representation of national sovereignty to the armed institutions, which neither can nor ought to assume either political functions or the representation of the popular will.\"\n\nAllende argued he had obeyed constitutional means for including military men to the cabinet at the service of civic peace and national security, defending republican institutions against insurrection and terrorism. In contrast, he said that Congress was promoting a ''coup d\u2019\u00e9tat'' or a civil war with a declaration full of affirmations that had already been refuted beforehand and which, in substance and process (directly handing it to the ministers rather than directly handing it to the President) violated a dozen articles of the (then-current) Constitution. He further argued that the legislature was usurping the government's executive function.\n\nAllende wrote: \"Chilean democracy is a conquest by all of the people. It is neither the work nor the gift of the exploiting classes, and it will be defended by those who, with sacrifices accumulated over generations, have imposed it...With a tranquil conscience...I sustain that never before has Chile had a more democratic government than that over which I have the honor to preside...I solemnly reiterate my decision to develop democracy and a state of law to their ultimate consequences...Congress has made itself a bastion against the transformations...and has done everything it can to perturb the functioning of the finances and of the institutions, sterilizing all creative initiatives.\"\n\nAdding that economic and political means would be needed to relieve the country's current crisis, and that the Congress were obstructing said means; having already paralyzed the State, they sought to destroy it. He concluded by calling upon the workers, all democrats and patriots to join him in defending the Chilean Constitution and the revolutionary process.\n\n== Coup ==\n{{Main|1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat}}\nIn early September 1973, Allende floated the idea of resolving the constitutional crisis with a [[plebiscite]]{{efn-ua|Allende's personal adviser, Juan Garc\u00e9s, escaped the siege on the Moneda Palace and fled to Europe, where he published testimonies about the last days of the administration: \"On September 10, Allende had assembled his ministers in an extraordinary council to finalize the call announcing the plebiscite.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Niedergang |first1=Marcel |title=LE JOUR M\u00caME DU COUP D'\u00c9TAT MILITAIRE Allende devait annoncer un pl\u00e9biscite sur le maintien des institutions d\u00e9mocratiques |url=https://www.lemonde.fr/archives/article/1973/09/29/le-jour-meme-du-coup-d-etat-militaire-allende-devait-annoncer-un-plebiscite-sur-le-maintien-des-institutions-democratiques_3097726_1819218.html?_ga=2.210696662.253475552.1585312576-339795860.1585312576 |accessdate=27 March 2020 |work=The Monde |date=29 September 1973}}{{subscription needed}}</ref>}}.

In a post-junta Chile where restrictions on free speech were steadily eroding, independent and seemingly reliable witnesses at last began to tell their stories to the news media and to human rights researchers.

In 1958, again as the FRAP candidate, Allende obtained 28.5% of the vote.

Hospitalized, he died of his wounds three days later, on 23 October. Schneider was a defender of the [[Schneider Doctrine|\"constitutionalist\" doctrine]] that the army's role is exclusively professional, its mission being to protect the country's sovereignty and not to interfere in politics.\n\nGeneral Schneider's death was widely disapproved of and, for the time, ended military opposition to Allende,<ref name=Falcoff>{{cite news |author=Mark Falcoff |url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=10612 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121205032024/http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=10612 |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 December 2012 |title=Kissinger and Chile originally |work=[[Commentary Magazine]] |date=10 November 2003 |accessdate=21 September 2006 |publisher=frontpagemag.com }}</ref> whom the Congress finally chose on 24 October.

Improved sanitation and housing facilities for low-income neighborhoods also equalized health care benefits, while hospital councils and local health councils were established in neighborhood health centers as a means of democratizing the administration of health policies.

The information would also be input into an economic simulation software (''CHECO'', for ''CHilean ECOnomic simulator'') which featured a [[Recursive Bayesian estimation|Bayesian filtering and control setting]] that the government could use to forecast the possible outcome of economic decisions.

The Christian Democrats (who had campaigned on a socialist platform in the 1970 elections, but drifted away from those positions during Allende's presidency, eventually forming a coalition with the [[National Party (Partido Nacional--PN)|National Party]]) {{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}, continued to accuse Allende of leading Chile toward a Cuban-style dictatorship, and sought to overturn many of his more radical policies. Allende and his opponents in Congress repeatedly accused each other of undermining the Chilean Constitution and acting undemocratically.\n\nAllende's increasingly bold socialist policies (partly in response to pressure from some of the more radical members within his coalition), combined with his close contacts with Cuba, heightened fears in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. The [[Richard Nixon|Nixon administration]] continued exerting economic pressure on Chile via multilateral organizations, and continued to back Allende's opponents in the Chilean Congress.

But when Chile [[Chilean nationalization of copper|nationalized its copper industry]], Washington cut off United States credits and increased its support to opposition. Forced to seek alternative sources of trade and finance, Chile gained commitments from the [[Soviet Union]] to invest some $400&nbsp;million in Chile in the next six years.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Allende's government was disappointed that it received far less economic assistance from the USSR than it hoped for. Trade between the two countries did not significantly increase and the credits were mainly linked to the purchase of Soviet equipment. Moreover, credits from the Soviet Union were much less than those provided to the People's Republic of China and countries of [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern Europe]].

Leonov adds that the relationships of KGB agents with Latin American leaders did not involve intelligence, because their intelligence target was the United States.

On 24 August 1973, General Prats was forced to resign both as defense minister and as the [[Chilean Army|commander-in-chief of the army]], embarrassed by both the [[Alejandrina Cox incident]] and a public protest in front of his house by the wives of his generals.

[with] the goal of establishing... a totalitarian system\" and claimed that the government had made \"violations of the Constitution... a permanent system of conduct.\" Essentially, most of the accusations were about disregard by the Socialist government of the separation of powers, and arrogating legislative and judicial prerogatives to the executive branch of government.\n\nSpecifically, the Socialist government of President Allende was accused of:\n* [[Rule by decree|Ruling by decree]], thwarting the normal legislative system\n* Refusing to enforce judicial decisions against its partisans; not carrying out sentences and judicial resolutions that contravened its objectives\n* Ignoring the decrees of the independent General Comptroller's Office\n* Sundry media offenses; usurping control of the National Television Network and applying economic pressure against those media organizations that are not unconditional supporters of the government\n* Allowing its Socialist supporters to assemble with arms, and preventing the same by its right-wing opponents\n* Supporting more than 1,500 illegal takeovers of farms\n* Illegal repression of the [[El Teniente]] miners' strike\n* Illegally limiting emigration\n\nFinally, the resolution condemned the creation and development of government-protected [socialist] armed groups, which were said to be \"headed towards a confrontation with the armed forces\". President Allende's efforts to re-organize the military and the police forces were characterized as \"notorious attempts to use the armed and police forces for partisan ends, destroy their institutional hierarchy, and politically infiltrate their ranks\".<ref>[[s:Agreement of the Chamber of Deputies of Chile|English translation]] on Wikisource.</ref>\n\n=== Allende's response ===\nTwo days later, on 24 August 1973, Allende responded, characterising the Congress's declaration as \"destined to damage the country's prestige abroad and create internal confusion\", predicting \"It will facilitate the seditious intention of certain sectors.\" He noted that the declaration (passed 81\u201347 in the Chamber of Deputies) had not obtained the two-thirds Senate majority \"constitutionally required\" to convict the president of [[abuse of power]]: essentially, the Congress were \"invoking the intervention of the armed forces and of Order against a democratically-elected government\" and \"subordinat[ing] political representation of national sovereignty to the armed institutions, which neither can nor ought to assume either political functions or the representation of the popular will.\"\n\nAllende argued he had obeyed constitutional means for including military men to the cabinet at the service of civic peace and national security, defending republican institutions against insurrection and terrorism. In contrast, he said that Congress was promoting a ''coup d\u2019\u00e9tat'' or a civil war with a declaration full of affirmations that had already been refuted beforehand and which, in substance and process (directly handing it to the ministers rather than directly handing it to the President) violated a dozen articles of the (then-current) Constitution. He further argued that the legislature was usurping the government's executive function.\n\nAllende wrote: \"Chilean democracy is a conquest by all of the people. It is neither the work nor the gift of the exploiting classes, and it will be defended by those who, with sacrifices accumulated over generations, have imposed it...With a tranquil conscience...I sustain that never before has Chile had a more democratic government than that over which I have the honor to preside...I solemnly reiterate my decision to develop democracy and a state of law to their ultimate consequences...Congress has made itself a bastion against the transformations...and has done everything it can to perturb the functioning of the finances and of the institutions, sterilizing all creative initiatives.\"\n\nAdding that economic and political means would be needed to relieve the country's current crisis, and that the Congress were obstructing said means; having already paralyzed the State, they sought to destroy it. He concluded by calling upon the workers, all democrats and patriots to join him in defending the Chilean Constitution and the revolutionary process.\n\n== Coup ==\n{{Main|1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat}}\nIn early September 1973, Allende floated the idea of resolving the constitutional crisis with a [[plebiscite]]{{efn-ua|Allende's personal adviser, Juan Garc\u00e9s, escaped the siege on the Moneda Palace and fled to Europe, where he published testimonies about the last days of the administration: \"On September 10, Allende had assembled his ministers in an extraordinary council to finalize the call announcing the plebiscite.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Niedergang |first1=Marcel |title=LE JOUR M\u00caME DU COUP D'\u00c9TAT MILITAIRE Allende devait annoncer un pl\u00e9biscite sur le maintien des institutions d\u00e9mocratiques |url=https://www.lemonde.fr/archives/article/1973/09/29/le-jour-meme-du-coup-d-etat-militaire-allende-devait-annoncer-un-plebiscite-sur-le-maintien-des-institutions-democratiques_3097726_1819218.html?_ga=2.210696662.253475552.1585312576-339795860.1585312576 |accessdate=27 March 2020 |work=The Monde |date=29 September 1973}}{{subscription needed}}</ref>}}.

The cranium, he says, shows evidence of a first shot with a small gun, like a pistol, and then, a second shot from a larger weapon\u2014like an AK-47\u2014which could mean that Allende was shot and killed, then shot a second time with his own gun, to make it look like suicide.<ref name=NPR>{{cite news | url = https://www.npr.org/2011/05/31/136831116/chile-investigates-ex-presidents-cause-of-death | title = For Chileans, Allende's Exhumation Raises The Past | publisher = NPR | accessdate =31 May 2011 | date=31 May 2011}}</ref>\n* In his 2004 documentary ''[[Salvador Allende (film)|Salvador Allende]]'', [[Patricio Guzm\u00e1n]] incorporates a graphic image of Allende's corpse in the position it was found after his death.

Wanamaker's main thoroughfare, Southeastern Avenue, is closed from Northeastern Avenue to McGaughey Road for the event. Vendors set up booths the length of the avenue and sell concessions and unique products. The Classic Car Show is held in conjunction with Old Settler's Day, rain or shine. Trophies are awarded to the top three in each official car class, and special awards are presented for various achievements.<ref>[http://homepage.mac.com/franklintwpchamber/oldsett.htm Old Settler's Days]</ref> The festivities are concluded by a large firework show at Franklin Central High School.
